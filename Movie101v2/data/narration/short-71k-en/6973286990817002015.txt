0:3:38|0:3:56|A Hao stood up carefully, holding a bowl of porridge and handing it to A Hua. Then he sat down, picked up the other half bowl of porridge and took two sips. He gestured with his fingers, signaling the three brothers to come closer, and even curious Ah Ping also leaned in.
0:4:10|0:4:14|Avoiding the landlady's gaze by turning sideways, [A Hao] quietly slipped something into [A Ping]'s hand.
0:4:16|0:4:24|At night, [Lei Luo] Inspector's car stopped in front of a restaurant, and Zhiu Yau quickly stepped forward to open the car door.
0:5:54|0:6:18|Hunter leaned against the table smugly, leisurely picking up the banknotes that had just been scattered. Hunter became furious and overturned the gambling table, grabbed a nearby bottle and smashed it on the other person's head. Yan Tong mercilessly slapped [Lei Luo], who was unwilling to accept it. He tried to rush forward several times but was firmly held back by Piggy. Two of them immediately rushed forward and...
0:6:19|0:6:24|Yan Tong helped Hunter walk away, with a dark expression on his face, he walked up to [Lei Luo].
0:7:14|0:7:23|A subordinate hurriedly ran over and whispered a few words to Yan Tong. After hearing it, Yan Tong gave his boss Gebo a subtle look without saying a word.
0:7:53|0:8:14|A Hao, accompanied by Ma Zai, Hua Zai Rong, and a group of henchmen, swaggered menacingly from the street corner. On the other side, Lei Luo, along with a group of henchmen, walked proudly with their heads held high. Both groups were armed with clubs and quickly converged in the center of the street. The street had already been cleared, leaving only the sound of footsteps. The street alley under the neon lights looked particularly bright.
0:8:14|0:8:21|Yan Tong and Chief of Police stood by the window on the second floor, holding wine glasses and watching the commotion.
0:8:28|0:8:37|The Big Bear took a few steps forward with a high and mighty attitude, while Qiang also unwillingly took two steps forward. The A Hao brothers finally arrived on time.
0:9:23|0:9:30|The henchmen rushed forward and instantly engaged in a chaotic fight.
0:9:36|0:9:44|[Wu Shihao] grabbed a mop and took the lead, quickly knocking down the opponent to the ground. He wielded the mop handle and struck hard, soon knocking down everyone around.
0:9:47|0:9:55|Da Wei swung a stick at someone, picked up a bottle and smashed it on the other person's head. A Qi threw the opponent to the ground and ruthlessly beat them.
0:9:59|0:10:16|[Wu Shihao] punched a few times and still wasn't satisfied, then stomped on the opponent's face several times. When someone rushed over to hold [Wu Shihao] to save his companion, he turned and flipped the person over. [Wu Shihao] wanted to pick up a baseball bat again, but was bombarded with beer bottles and couldn't move forward. Gongzi Qiang and Big Bear were surrounded by the opponent's men and couldn't break through several times.
0:10:23|0:10:33|Upon seeing Da Wei, [A Hao] took a big step forward and kicked the henchman next to Da Wei, sending him flying. [Lei Luo] was lying on the floor above, watching very carefully.
0:10:40|0:11:5|[Wu Shihao] rushed to Xiao Wei's side like a firefighter to scare off the people who were about to beat Xiao Wei. [Lei Luo] appreciated this scene and couldn't help but smile. Ah Qi, in the midst of the fight, even remembered to pick up [Wu Shihao]'s shoe. He shook off a person next to him, picked up the shoe from a pile of broken glass, and threw it to [Wu Shihao] across the crowd. [Wu Shihao] caught the shoe, put it on, and turned around to see the riot police coming to suppress them. The four brothers couldn't help but take a few steps back.
0:11:5|0:11:14|At this moment, they realized that the riot police had already blocked off the streets and alleys.
0:11:25|0:11:36|Hunter gave the order, and the police fired tear gas canisters down the entire street. Everyone covered their mouths and started running in all directions. Seeing the tear gas taking effect, Hunter put on a gas mask and directed the operation.
0:11:38|0:11:47|The police officer held up a shield in one hand and a baton in the other, ruthlessly beating these hooligans. A Hao and Lei Luo, along with two others, ran into an alley in panic.
0:12:11|0:12:27|[Wu Shihao] immediately covered his mouth, picked up a stick and stared at the alley entrance. At this moment, a group of police officers sneaked into the alley, and the street thugs had been mostly subdued.
0:12:28|0:12:35|Ge Bai praised Yan Tong for doing a good job. The four brothers knocked out the police officers, put on their clothes, and even pulled down the underwear of one of them.
0:12:35|0:12:45|They jokingly handed the police officer's underwear to Hua Zairong, who covered his mouth. The four police officers were left naked on the ground. Hua Zairong covered his mouth and rushed out of the alley first, looking around before fleeing in embarrassment.
0:12:45|0:12:51|A Hao and three others casually grabbed the small gangsters squatting on the street, escorting them out with a serious expression.
0:12:51|0:13:16|After walking out of the alley, [A Hao] carefully surveyed the chaotic scene through his gas mask. The turmoil deeply imprinted in his eyes, [A Hao] immediately chose a direction and walked towards it. In the distance, Hunter looked up and noticed four policemen without boots. Hunter quickly ordered them to stop, but the four ignored him and ran off down the street.
0:13:22|0:13:37|The police chased the four brothers to a bus, and the four could only run into the bus with pursuers in front and behind. The police also got on the bus, raised their guns and aimed at [A Hao]. [A Hao] raised his hands to calm them down and sat on a chair.
0:13:42|0:13:50|Hunter pointed at Da Wei's group, ordering his subordinates to beat them up ruthlessly. [A Hao] couldn't help but shout at them to stop, but no one paid any attention. The scene became chaotic for a moment, [A Hao] cursed and rushed forward, pushing Hunter down at the stairs of the car door.
0:13:50|0:13:55|A Hao kicked him out of the car again, Hunter fell on the ground in a sprawled position, before he could recover.
0:13:55|0:14:3|[Wu Shihao] took out a baton from Hunter and mercilessly struck at him, leaving Hunter powerless to fight back.
0:14:10|0:14:21|[Lei Luo] aimed his gun at [A Hao], who cautiously took a step back while staring at [Lei Luo].
0:14:29|0:14:37|[Lei Luo] stood with his hands behind his back by the bay, looking at Hong Kong across the water.
0:14:38|0:14:44|[Lei Luo] took a sip of the coffee handed to him by Fatso, then pulled out a pineapple bun from the paper bag.
0:14:46|0:14:53|[Lei Luo] looked across and took a big bite of pineapple bun.
0:15:40|0:15:46|Suddenly, Xiao Wei stood up and leaned against the fence as if remembering something.
0:16:20|0:16:27|A Hao immediately stood up straight when he heard the door opening, and [Lei Luo] nodded outside A Hao's cell, pointing inside.
0:16:56|0:16:59|[Lei Luo] took the cigarette box handed by Zhu Youzai and gave A Hao a cigarette.
0:17:1|0:17:13|A Hao took a puff of cigarette lit by [Lei Luo], thanked him, and then introduced himself as [Wu Shihao], a Penang native.
0:19:26|0:19:37|Henderson smashed the bowl in A Hao's hand against the wall, staring at him while quietly reaching for his baton. He suddenly drew the baton and mercilessly swung it at A Hao.
0:19:58|0:20:10|Two foreign police officers picked up water guns and sprayed towards Da Wei and the other two, the high-pressure water pushed them off balance and they fell to the ground. Hunter then viciously kicked A Hao a few times, trying to take the subordinate's water gun.
0:20:11|0:20:18|At this moment, [Lei Luo] stood outside the prison cell with a group of reporters, snapping photos. Seeing this, Hunter quickly stepped forward to stop him.
0:20:30|0:20:38|Ordering the reporters to stop taking photos, they obediently put down their cameras. Hunter also ordered his subordinates to open the prison door and walked out.
0:20:38|0:20:45|He stood in front of [Lei Luo] and a group of reporters, pointing fiercely at [Lei Luo] to warn him not to be too proud.
0:21:21|0:21:28|A Hao looked sternly and then turned to look at Wu Shihao lying on the ground. In his dream, Wu Shihao was holding several flowers and smiling at his wife under the tree.
0:21:28|0:21:38|His wife took the flowers with a happy smile, and he and A Mei rode bicycles through a forest. Suddenly, A Hao's body tilted and fell off the bike.
0:21:52|0:22:1|[Wu Shihao] looked around from the hospital bed and struggled to sit up.
0:22:59|0:23:9|[Wu Shihao] and his companions, dressed in brand new suits, stylishly walked out of a clothing store. The five brothers walked side by side on the street, all smiles, showing no intention of giving way to the cars behind them.
0:23:58|0:24:5|[Wu Shihao] turned around and glanced at Da Lanchai, waving to his brothers.
0:24:6|0:24:14|[A Hao] shook his head helplessly as he counted the money in his hand, then glared at [Lei Luo]. Walking over, [A Hao] waved the banknotes in his hand.
0:24:25|0:24:35|[Wu Shihao] waved his hand and hugged A Hua, patting her head.
0:25:7|0:25:18|Sir Zhou stood on the stage and greeted the guests. He then took his daughter's hand and walked to the front of the stage, standing next to the microphone. Sir Zhou solemnly introduced a friend of his daughter to everyone, stating that this young man is very outstanding.
0:25:41|0:25:51|[Lei Luo] smirked as he watched Yan Tong's awkward expression and then turned to go up on stage. Zhou Jue joyfully held hands with [Lei Luo] and his daughter.
0:27:13|0:27:19|Yan Tong's face was so dark that water could be squeezed out of it.
0:27:32|0:27:42|Grimly staring at [Lei Luo], under Gebo's gaze, he could only slightly retract his gaze. On the other side, [Wu Shihao] swiftly shuttled through the streets, paying no attention to the passing vehicles.
0:27:42|0:27:56|He pushed through the crowd frantically, not daring to stop for a moment. Xiao Wei and A Qi were also panting as they ran after him. Suddenly, Lei Luo stopped in front of a small alley and glanced inside before rushing in.
0:27:57|0:28:2|A Hao was seen hanging on the side, barefoot struggling to step on a piece of ice, with a mouthful of cigarettes.
0:28:16|0:28:22|[Wu Shihao] made a stopping gesture, calmed down A Qi and Xiao Wei, then turned around and walked slowly towards Fei Zai Chao.
0:28:22|0:28:26|A Hao sat across from a man with a bare upper body, with a huge dragon tattoo on his back.
0:28:26|0:28:33|[Wu Shihao] glanced at the suspended Dawei, then awkwardly walked over to stand next to Fatty Chiu.
0:28:59|0:29:19|Dawei looked embarrassed, not daring to look at [A Hao]. [A Hao] grimaced and grabbed a bottle of wine nearby, smashing it on his own forehead. In return, Feizai gave a disdainful look and turned away. Pointing at his head, [A Hao] picked up another bottle. Dawei, looking like he was about to cry, shook his head desperately. [A Hao] touched his head, covered in blood and shards of glass.
0:29:37|0:30:4|At this moment, the tattooed man stood provocatively next to [A Hao]. Seizing the opportunity, [A Hao] headbutted the tattooed man's face, then grabbed his head and slammed it onto a nearby table. Quickly gaining the upper hand, [A Hao] mounted the tattooed man and relentlessly beat him, making it impossible for the tattooed man to lift his head. [A Hao] stood up and viciously kicked him several times. Seizing a moment, the tattooed man flung [A Hao] towards a table behind him. [A Hao] quickly got up, grabbed a chair, and smashed it towards the tattooed man.
0:30:4|0:30:10|A Hao's second chair didn't hit the tattooed man, but hit Fat Boy Chao's little brothers instead, and they all threw their cups at A Hao.
0:30:17|0:30:24|[Wu Shihao] used the chair in his hand as cover, once again knocking down the tattooed man, pounding him on the ground with fierce punches, while Fatso blocked a group of henchmen.
0:30:25|0:30:31|Staring intently at the two fighting. [A Hao] was riding on the tattooed man, mercilessly punching him in the face. Seeing the tattooed man losing, Fatso kicked [A Hao] away with one foot.
0:30:33|0:30:45|Without time to make up for the second kick, Fatty Chiu slipped and fell to the ground. In the scuffle, A Hao and Lei Luo pressed to the side, A Hao raised his fist and swung it at the tattooed man's face, occasionally giving Fatty Chiu a punch as well.
0:30:49|0:30:56|Fei Zai and his group of little brothers forcefully separated the two.
0:30:58|0:31:6|The tattooed man struggled against the obstruction of his henchmen and desperately rushed towards [A Hao], while Fatty Super touched his swollen face and took a deep breath.
0:31:40|0:32:6|Fatty Chiu threw the money in front of [Ng Sei Ho], then turned and left with his men. [Ng Sei Ho] stared at Fatty Chiu's departing figure without moving. Ah Chut and Siu Wai hurried forward to release Tai Wai. [Ng Sei Ho] picked up the money from the ground with a stern face. Tai Wai, who had been released, couldn't stand up straight, he groaned in pain while holding his mouth. Siu Wai took off his clothes and put them on Tai Wai, who was shivering, then cautiously glanced at [Ng Sei Ho].
0:32:6|0:32:20|[Wu Shihao] ignored them, moved a chair and sat down. Xiao Wei massaged Da Wei's back, then glanced at [Wu Shihao]. [Wu Shihao] sat on the chair, turned his cold eyes towards Da Wei.
0:32:40|0:33:5|Kowloon Walled City is a truly lawless area, with buildings densely packed like a beehive. An airplane roars overhead, heading towards the neighboring Kai Tak Airport. The sunlight cannot penetrate this courtyard-like cluster of buildings. Even though it's daytime, the city is still dark and gloomy. On the third floor corridor, a woman is mercilessly hitting the man in front of her, while an old man casually pours a basin of water out. Various shops are open on the ground floor.
0:33:5|0:33:13|Some people are chatting while others are sitting at the table eating. [A Hao] walks into this city stronghold with his hands in his pockets as usual.
0:33:13|0:33:25|He grabbed a bottle of cola from a nearby store, inserted a straw and held it in his hand, then walked up a flight of stairs confidently. He glanced at the middle-aged women playing mahjong at the stairwell. He handed the cola to a young girl who was reading a book.
0:33:53|0:34:3|[Wu Shihao] took a turn and walked into a room through another side door, where several elderly people skillfully packed bags of drugs and placed them on a scale to check the weight.
0:34:5|0:34:27|A Qi put down his cigarette, looked at the iron door next to him and scratched his head, [A Hao] opened the iron door and walked towards another room, the little brother at the door kindly lifted the door curtain, the casino was noisy, [A Hao] walked straight to the excited Da Wei next to the gambling table and patted his shoulder, he grabbed the already stunned Da Wei, put his arm around his neck and walked out of the casino, Da Wei followed [A Hao] unsteadily, sneakily glancing at [A Hao]'s face.
0:34:27|0:34:36|[A Hao] pushed Big Wei to the stairs at the edge of the casino, slapped him a few times, and Big Wei, scared, held his head, looking at [A Hao] with a pleading expression.
0:34:44|0:34:52|Da Wei dared not move a muscle as he listened to the reprimand, cowering and avoiding eye contact with [Wu Shihao].
0:35:12|0:35:17|[Wu Shihao] glared discontentedly at Da Wei, then turned and walked away. Da Wei slapped himself a few times and quickly followed after.
0:35:17|0:35:25|Xiao Wei sat on the side, glancing sideways at the people in front of him.
0:36:6|0:36:22|A Qi snatched the ball from the boy's feet, lightly kicked it to the other side, [Wu Shihao] caught the ball and then turned to kick it to Xiao Wei's feet. The boy rushed over anxiously to grab the ball, but the four of them played around passing the ball to each other. After having enough fun, the four of them walked out of the city station with their hands in their pockets, currently one of their jobs.
0:36:22|0:36:32|It's A Hao helping Fatso collect debts. [Lei Luo] stopped a bus, took out a photo and carefully compared it with the man in front of him. After confirming the match, he quickly pinned the man against the window.
0:36:32|0:36:42|[A Hao] jumped lightly out of the car, still holding a thick package in his arms. On the other side, [Lei Luo] threw a person from the second floor to the front of Da Wei. The two brothers calmly put down their chopsticks.
0:36:42|0:36:53|Chasing after the debtor who is on the run. They would not hesitate to stab the other party in the stomach to force debt repayment, and they would also use some cruel interrogation methods, but they never lay a hand on the elderly and women. [A Hao] calmly walks out of a room.
0:36:53|0:37:4|Blowing on his red fist by the roadside, a group of people scrambled out of the den and fled in embarrassment as they were chased by Da Wei and Xiao Wei. [A Hao] walked confidently with his brothers in the village, the four of them already...
0:37:56|0:38:7|A Hao placed the cola on the table impatiently, turned his head to the side, Lei Luo smiled indifferently and took out a stack of banknotes from his pocket.
0:38:44|0:39:3|Yan Zheng left without looking back. [Wu Shihao] silently watched Yan leave, glanced at the table, and locked eyes with Ah Qi. The two of them wordlessly crouched down and picked up the money scattered on the ground by Yan Zheng.
0:39:3|0:39:8|[Lei Luo] stood at the stairway quietly watching the scene.
0:39:49|0:40:6|Fat Boy held a cigar in his mouth and pounded the drum in front of him. The bass player beside him was at a loss, plucking the strings with a stiff expression to match Fat Boy. The audience below was stunned, unsure of how to react to the performance. Finally, Fat Boy finished the last beat.
0:40:12|0:40:34|Everyone formed a large circle in the center of the dance floor, excitedly twisting and turning while embracing the person in front of them. Soon, they were waving their hands wildly to the exhilarating music on the dance floor. [A Hao] and [Lei Luo] stood on the stage, swaying to the music rhythmically. Xiao Wei, with a rogue look on his face, blew smoke rings at the dancing girls, only to be playfully blocked by one of them. Fatty sat on the side, holding a dancing girl in his arms, carefully observing the playful four.
0:40:50|0:40:57|[Wu Shihao] glanced at his watch, checked the time, and then picked up a glass of wine to toast with Feizai. A minibus slowly drove down the road in the rain.
0:41:6|0:41:12|Suddenly, a beam of bright light shines on the fishing boat.
0:41:22|0:41:34|A Mei huddled in the cabin with the child, at a loss. Soon the marine police boarded the fishing boat, and the boat owner and others were nervously dealing with the marine police, while the passengers on board had been driven to the sea at the stern.
0:41:48|0:42:5|The marine police officer cautiously shone his flashlight and took a few steps forward. He shone it under the boat, then turned back to look at the fishing boat owner who patted his neck. The officer then slowly turned around, took off his hat and tucked it under his arm, before turning back to look at the fishing boat owner.
0:42:20|0:42:41|A man ran out of the cabin, picked up a paddle and went to the stern. He forcefully poked the child calling for help underwater. The water police put on a hat, shone a flashlight, and shook the fisherman's chain off his neck. The water police grabbed the fisherman's neck, warning him to stay away. The man kept desperately poking the child calling for help into the water.
0:42:49|0:42:53|The man repeatedly pokes [A Mei] and the child into the water with an oar.
0:42:53|0:43:4|The owner of the fishing boat gathered some money and stuffed it into the hands of the well, [A Mei] and the child were pressed down by the oar and couldn't lift their heads, she struggled desperately to try to grab the oar. Suddenly,
0:43:4|0:43:12|The oar swung fiercely and hit [A Mei] on the head, causing her to faint. Meanwhile, [Wu Shihao] was still excitedly heading towards the pier without knowing what had happened.
0:43:12|0:43:26|The sea was dark, with only the spotlight on the marine police boat shining brightly. [A Mei] held the child's hand and slowly sank to the bottom of the sea. The minibus finally arrived at the shore, and [Wu Shihao] excitedly jumped out of the car with a gift in his arms.
0:43:26|0:43:50|[A Hao] and the other three hurried towards the pier. [A Hao] saw two bodies on the ground, he pushed aside and squatted down to comfort Ah Ping who was crying on the side.
0:43:57|0:44:11|[Wu Shihao] pushed the fishermen standing on the side like crazy, then hurriedly knelt down beside [A Mei]'s body. He looked at [A Mei], then at the child, only left with a desperate roar. The fishermen stood on the side, not daring to make a sound.
0:44:11|0:44:20|Suddenly, A Hao rushed to the nearest fishing boat owner, swinging his fist mercilessly at him, while Da Wei and Xiao Wei also got into a fight with the boat owner.
0:44:20|0:44:31|[Wu Shihao] held [A Mei] and the child tightly in his arms, sitting on the side in despair, unable to cry anymore. Ah Qi and Xiao Wei knelt behind [Wu Shihao], wiping tears, overwhelmed with sadness. In the blink of an eye.
0:44:31|0:44:38|Six months have passed, Chu Yau Koi and [Lei Luo] are sitting in a cha chaan teng.
0:44:46|0:44:56|[Lei Luo] stood up straight, opened the salt shaker on the table, and placed it in front of A Hao. He then poured all the coffee into the salt shaker.
0:45:27|0:45:50|Porky gazes meaningfully at Wah Yee Wing, and the Big Bear, who has finished eating, lies down in the bathtub as usual. Suddenly, a large amount of fresh blood gushes from his mouth. At this moment, the bathroom door is opened, and Big Sis and Wah Yee Wing walk in with smiles on their faces. It turns out that Big Sis poisoned the Big Bear's wine during dinner. Wah Yee Wing turns on the hairdryer and gently tosses it into the fish tank. The Big Bear looks at Wah Yee Wing in horror, and the legendary street fighter falls.
0:46:21|0:46:39|A Hao lay motionless with dull eyes on a worn-out leather sofa, while his little sister doing homework couldn't help but glance at him. A Hao sprawled there with his legs stretched out, as if everything around him had nothing to do with him.
0:47:52|0:47:59|Porky returned the gun to its original place, then drove with [Lei Luo] to Kowloon Walled City.
0:47:59|0:48:5|He parked the car in front of Kowloon Walled City and ran into the entrance of the City Station with [Lei Luo].
0:48:9|0:48:14|[Lei Luo] nodded and, under the gaze of Fatso, led a few police officers into the village along the alleyway.
0:48:14|0:48:30|Even during the day, the streets here are not bright at all. Four police officers are on high alert, closely following behind [Lei Luo]. A man is practicing martial arts shirtless, with a cleaver chopping at his body without causing any harm. [Lei Luo] furrows his brow, glances around, then turns and walks into another alleyway.
0:48:30|0:48:38|The roads in the village are complex and confusing. [Lei Luo] has lost count of how many circles he has made. In a dimly lit room, the brothers gather together.
0:48:45|0:49:6|A Hao glanced outside the room, sat on the chair with a pensive look, nervously shaking his leg, not sure what he was thinking. Then he got up and walked towards the door, lifting the curtain to go out. [Lei Luo] walked down a section of stairs, looking around solemnly. He recalled a recent visit when Ding Ye was lying comfortably on the kang, smoking his pipe.
0:49:6|0:49:19|[Lei Luo] sat elegantly with his head down on the other side. After a while, Boss Ding suddenly sat up, chewing on something, and looked at [Lei Luo] with a scrutinizing expression. Sensing Boss Ding's gaze, [Lei Luo] slightly raised his head. It was a silent game of wits.
0:49:19|0:49:40|The scene cuts back to the village, as [Lei Luo] walks to the center of the building, a bottle of wine falls from the sky and smashes at [Lei Luo]'s feet. The police officers beside him immediately put their hands into their pockets, ready to draw their guns at any moment. [Lei Luo] pats one of them on the shoulder, signaling him to put his hand away. Suddenly, a large group of shirtless men emerge from all sides, surrounding [Lei Luo] and his group. They remain calm, but alert, keeping a close eye on their surroundings.
0:49:40|0:49:51|Calmly watching the crowd closing in, [Lei Luo] did not move. These people looked arrogant and domineering, openly staring at [Lei Luo], while the unrelated residents around had already scattered and fled.
0:50:13|0:50:19|[A Hao] turned into an alley, walking while glancing up at the thug guarding the exit upstairs.
0:50:19|0:50:27|After confirming the location, he immediately turned back and returned to the alley. By now, the ancestral hall was already filled with people, with Boss Ding devoutly worshipping.
0:50:27|0:50:35|Gongzai Qiang glanced at [Lei Luo], who calmly raised an eyebrow and ignored him. Dingye inserted three incense sticks into the censer and then turned around.
0:50:44|0:50:51|A Hao kept his head down and obediently knelt beside Boss Ding.
0:51:15|0:51:30|A Hao lifted the cushion of the leather sofa, took out a revolver from inside, then he turned over a tin can, biscuits and bullets spilled out. A Hao picked up the bullets one by one and loaded them into the gun, then he holstered the gun behind his waist.
0:51:47|0:51:59|Gongzai Qiang suddenly stood up, shot Dingye in the head, then fired a few more shots at Dingye as if venting, and turned the gun towards [Lei Luo]. [Lei Luo] was knocked down by the huge impact, spitting out a mouthful of blood.
0:51:59|0:52:8|The henchmen of Brother Qiang have taken over the ancestral hall. Inside the hall, it is a scene of bloodshed. [Lei Luo] dodges Brother Qiang's gunfire once again, then turns and runs.
0:52:34|0:52:43|A Hao calmly walked past a security door, carefully examining the weapons and equipment of the guards. Despite the cautious gaze of the guards, A Hao walked straight ahead without any hesitation.
0:52:48|0:52:57|[Lei Luo] crashed into an anti-theft fence and quickly turned into an alley. The thugs with machetes shouted and chased after [Lei Luo]. [Lei Luo] crossed a flight of stairs, but slipped on the oil and water on the ground. He had to pull out his gun and hide in a corner.
0:52:57|0:53:3|[Lei Luo] shot the people in the front accurately, causing the henchmen to dodge and not dare to approach.
0:53:3|0:53:20|[Lei Luo] decisively killed a thug, reached into his arms and felt something was wrong. He nervously looked around and found the signal box had fallen into the bamboo basket on the opposite side. The intense gunfire prevented him from retrieving the gun. The clever thug used a cart as cover, closing in step by step. [Lei Luo] had no choice but to run deeper.
0:53:20|0:53:38|On the other side, [Wu Shihao] slowly climbed down from the anti-theft window upstairs. He leaped lightly into the alley and looked around. [Lei Luo] was about to be caught up, he hid around the corner, knocked down a thug with a shovel, [Lei Luo] swung the shovel hard and knocked down several people decisively, but in the end, outnumbered, he was cut on the arm by a thug.
0:53:38|0:53:56|He dodged another knife and fled in a panic, with henchmen constantly pouring in from the front. [Lei Luo] was hit on the head with a shovel from the opposite side, and the henchmen in the alley behind also rushed over immediately. In a life-and-death moment, he used the shovel to push open a side door and flashed in. The henchmen swarmed up to block the gate, and for a moment, no one could squeeze through.
0:53:56|0:54:3|[Lei Luo] staggered down an alley when suddenly a hand reached out and pulled him into an iron gate.
0:54:17|0:54:29|Da Wei and Xiao Wei arrived at the security door where A Hao had previously scouted, and approached the guard cautiously. A Qi agilely climbed up along the window edge, layer by layer. He crossed over a cement wall and entered a small house on the terrace.
0:54:29|0:54:46|Rushing in, Da Wei handed cigarettes to the guard through the door. When he saw A Qi running down the stairs behind the guard, he grabbed the guard, took out a stick and started beating him. A Qi also took care of another guard, successfully taking over the security door. They found the key on the guard, opened the door, and [Wu Shihao] supported [Lei Luo].
0:54:47|0:55:4|Rushing through the streets and alleys, they arrived at the open anti-theft door. Da Wei and Xiao Wei covered [Wu Shihao] and [Lei Luo] as they passed through the door, then closed it. The three of them faced death with determination, blocking the group of thugs rushing towards them.
0:55:12|0:55:23|[A Hao] and [Lei Luo] were surrounded by the thugs. Da Wei and Xiao Wei rushed over, but in front of [A Hao], the thugs wildly waved their weapons and refused to back down, creating a tense situation.
0:55:39|0:55:46|[Wu Shihao] held up his gun and surveyed the surroundings. The henchmen were impressed by [Wu Shihao]'s bold words, and for a moment, no one dared to approach.
0:55:58|0:56:2|Under the command of A Hao, the henchmen rushed forward without hesitation.
0:56:2|0:56:8|A Hao shot and killed the thugs behind him, scanned the surroundings, found the right direction, and kicked over a table as he moved forward.
0:56:8|0:56:22|Sparks flew out of the stove on the table, scattering into the neighboring fireworks shop. In the dark night, a spectacular fireworks display erupted above the Kowloon Walled City. [A Hao] and [Lei Luo] both looked up at the fireworks overhead, perhaps this was their last hope.
0:56:23|0:56:42|Chu Fat took a puff of his cigarette, suddenly stunned on the side. At this moment, chaos reigned in the Kowloon Walled City. Seven stopped the thugs in front of Ng Shing-ho, and Ng Shing-ho took the opportunity to open an iron door, grabbing Lei Luo and rushing in.
0:56:45|0:57:0|Fireworks were still echoing, as Zhu Youzai looked up and identified the direction, leading his teammates around a corner. A Hao, holding a gun, embraced the now defenseless Lei Luo and walked to a fork in the road. He looked around and settled Lei Luo on a pile of sacks, placing the gun in Lei Luo's hand.
0:57:0|0:57:6|[Wu Shihao] stood up immediately, took off his coat and walked out, his cold and stern expression sending shivers down people's spines.
0:57:6|0:57:16|He used his coat as a weapon, swinging it towards the thugs rushing at him with knives. [A Hao] swiftly took down two or three of them, only to be slashed on the arm by a machete, causing blood to gush out instantly.
0:57:16|0:57:27|The thugs raised their machetes and rushed forward without regard for their lives. [A Hao] swung his coat and threw punches at the thugs in front of him, kicking one thug who tried to pick up a knife off the high platform.
0:57:27|0:57:37|Another quick step forward, picking up a machete and chopping down towards the opponent's forehead. [A Hao]'s ruthless style scared several henchmen into trembling and retreating. At this moment, [A Hao] was already bloodthirsty, holding the machete.
0:57:37|0:57:49|Moving forward a few steps, he kicked away the wooden frame blocking his path, waved the knife at the thug sitting on the ground, and as one thug raised the machete, half of his finger was cut off by [A Hao], who recklessly charged forward swinging the machete.
0:57:49|0:58:9|A Hao held a machete to intimidate the opponents, kicked down the person in front of him, lifted a nearby iron bucket and smashed it behind, he pointed the machete at the surrounding thugs cursing, and finally, as if tired, he stood with the machete on his waist and circled around. Surprisingly, no one approached. A Hao raised the machete to scare the surrounding thugs, and then chased after two people with big steps.
0:58:9|0:58:15|Suddenly, a few people emerged from a side road, holding a pair of handcuffs, and accurately shackled A Hao's leg.
0:58:15|0:58:30|[Wu Shihao] was dragged into the alley, witnessing this scene, [Lei Luo] struggled several times, raised his gun and tried to save [Wu Shihao]. [Wu Shihao] was dragged to the bottom of the alley, and then several people rushed up to hold [Wu Shihao] down tightly. Fatty Chao walked out from the side.
0:58:51|0:58:56|[Lei Luo] staggered to his feet and just as he looked up, he witnessed this gruesome scene. Fatso once again raised the brick and actually smashed [A Hao]'s leg out of shape.
0:58:56|0:59:3|[Wu Shihao] struggled weakly, tortured by intense pain, his eyes widened, then he passed out. [Lei Luo] raised his gun and crazily pulled the trigger at the Fatso and his gang.
0:59:5|0:59:22|[Wu Shihao] was left aside, in pain with cold sweat streaming down, his eyelids kept rolling outwards. [Lei Luo] was also shot down, he spat out blood and lay on the ground convulsing in pain. Gongzi, holding a gun, slowly walked down the stairs, looking down at [Lei Luo].
0:59:42|0:59:54|[Wu Shihao] was in so much pain that he was sweating profusely, twisting in agony while holding his leg, the light in the operating room was so bright that it was blinding.
1:0:4|1:0:20|[Wu Shihao] lay on the operating table in a daze, flashing back to the images of Ah Mei and the child in his mind. He saw himself falling from a tall building, shattering in front of Ah Mei and the child's eyes. [Wu Shihao] finally woke up with wide eyes, mouth agape, still not fully aware.
1:0:20|1:0:26|Unable to help but take a deep breath, recalling the dream just now. [Lei Luo] sat silently by the bedside,
1:0:27|1:0:41|[Wu Shihao] looked sadly at his right leg being suspended, then slowly shifted his gaze to [Lei Luo]. [Lei Luo] looked back at [Wu Shihao], with a piece of bloody gauze stuck to his forehead. [Wu Shihao] ignored [Lei Luo] and just glanced at him lightly before looking away.
1:0:42|1:1:2|[Lei Luo] stood up with a cane, his left arm still in a cast hanging around his neck. He stood in front of [A Hao] for a long time, finally putting down the cane and gently placing his hand on the knee of [A Hao]'s fallen right leg. [A Hao] looked expressionless, with no movement in front of him. Finally, [Lei Luo] removed his hand, turned his head to look at [A Hao].
1:1:9|1:1:15|[Lei Luo] knew that saying more was useless, so he turned around and left with a cane. [A Hao] stared straight at his right leg.
1:1:15|1:1:24|With his nostrils slightly flared and lips trembling, tears glistening in his eyes, he hesitated for a moment before choking up and turning his head away.
1:1:24|1:1:33|A tear rolled down the cheek and landed on the pillow. With his skills not fully utilized and his passion not yet unleashed, the current self...
1:1:33|1:1:42|A Hao has turned into a disabled person. Lei Luo is tied up in a chair, and a bald man is fiercely beating Lei Luo's bare feet with a stick.
1:1:56|1:2:1|Several people poured a cup of milk tea filled with chopped hair into Fat Boy's mouth all at once.
1:2:14|1:2:25|[Wu Shihao] sat by the bedside, slowly lifting his left foot off the ground and then letting his right foot fall. As he tried to lift his left foot again, his right foot gave way and he fell to the ground. The hospital room was quiet, with no one coming to help him.
1:2:25|1:2:37|[Wu Shihao] lay quietly on the ground, with determination in his eyes and gritting his teeth. While a wheelchair could be used temporarily for mobility, [Wu Shihao] was determined not to spend his life in one. Soon, he gathered his spirits and started exercising in the hospital corridor.
1:2:37|1:2:54|He briskly walked towards the wheelchair, dragging his disabled right leg. One wrong move and he could fall to the ground. Qing Jie couldn't help but look at this man. She saw him lift his head, prop himself up, stand up with the help of the wheelchair, turn around, and continue to walk briskly towards the other side, step by step, unsteady yet determined.
1:2:54|1:3:2|Afterwards, Qing Jie often pushed [Wu Shihao] outside the hospital to relax. The four brothers handed [Wu Shihao] a delicate cane with a tiger head as his discharge gift.
1:3:2|1:3:7|After this incident, [Wu Shihao] and [Lei Luo] also became sworn brothers.
1:3:11|1:3:17|[Wu Shihao] erected a tombstone for his wife and child, placing a bouquet of flowers in front of the grave. He stared at the tombstone with sunglasses on, his mind filled with a myriad of thoughts.
1:3:17|1:3:26|From this moment on, [A Hao] no longer had any weaknesses. As the plane flew over the Kowloon Walled City once again, [Lei Luo] watched this scene with a smile on his face.
1:3:26|1:3:37|The sky above Kowloon Walled City changed completely after the fall of Boss Ding. Two luxury cars casually stopped in front of a group of brawling thugs, and [Lei Luo] walked towards the crowd with a cane step by step.
1:4:1|1:4:19|Xiao Wei sat at the dining table with his legs crossed, counting money. Ah Qi came over and handed him two heavy bags. A Hao sat in the office, throwing money everywhere. Lei Luo successfully married Sir Zhou's daughter, and A Hao also married Nurse Qing Jie who had taken care of him for a long time.
1:4:40|1:4:44|[Wu Shihao] propped up his body, took a puff of cigarette, squinted his eyes and carefully observed everything in front of him.
1:5:9|1:5:15|[Wu Shihao] came to the arena leaning on his iconic cane, and Hunter looked at [Wu Shihao] mockingly.
1:6:34|1:6:36|A Hao criticized Yan Tong and Hunter for their incompetence. Yan Tong stood awkwardly on the side without being able to defend himself, while Hunter kept emphasizing that there must be an insider involved in this matter.
1:6:37|1:6:45|Qingjie walked arm in arm with [A Hao], followed closely by [Lei Luo]. He swaggered through a corridor, proudly stroking his Dragon Pool rat under the spotlight.
1:6:45|1:6:59|Upon seeing this scene, Yan Tong and others had very unpleasant expressions. The champion, [Wu Shihao], finally shook hands with the Queen of England as he wished. Yan Tong's boss, furious, left the stands without looking back. Hunter's subordinates made many bets to shake the world.
1:6:59|1:7:11|At this moment, amidst endless complaints, [A Hao] angrily threw the lottery ticket at his subordinate, grabbed his collar, and warned him to keep quiet.
1:8:4|1:8:22|[Lei Luo] furrowed his brows, lowered his eyes in thought, and then looked at Fatso Chiu. At this moment, Fatso Chiu was still squatting in the prison cell. Lei Luo casually followed the prison guard around, looking around. Suddenly, he saw Yan Tong and Hunter leaning against the railing not far away. Fatso Chiu smiled and gestured with his fingers in a figure-eight motion towards the opposite side, until he was escorted away by the prison guard.
1:8:22|1:8:34|[Yan Tong] stood in the shade with Fatty Chiu, saying something to him. [Hunter] leaned against the railing, looking impatient. After giving instructions, [Yan Tong] patted Fatty Chiu's chest as if to make him think it over carefully.
1:8:34|1:8:41|Later, [Hunter] found [Lei Luo], who was standing with his hands behind his back in front of a big tree. [Hunter] stood next to [Lei Luo].
1:8:55|1:9:10|Disagreeing with Hunter's statement, A Hao felt that this idea might not necessarily solve the problem. Hunter ignored Lei Luo's thoughts and firmly insisted on doing it this way. In the evening, A Hao drove Da Wei on the highway.
1:9:27|1:9:34|A beautiful woman in red clothes is sitting on the sofa.
1:10:8|1:10:14|Hua Zairong approached Rose with a gentlemanly look on his face, extending his hand. [Lei Luo] led [A Hao] to a corner of the living room and patted his arm.
1:10:19|1:10:25|[Lei Luo] pointed to the door with a smile, and [A Hao] turned around without any defense. When he saw Fei Zai Chao, his expression froze.
1:10:57|1:11:3|Outside the house, it was calm, but inside, a storm was brewing.
1:11:11|1:11:19|[Lei Luo] took a puff of his cigarette and looked up.
1:12:7|1:12:13|Everyone stopped what they were doing and watched [Lei Luo] cautiously. [Lei Luo] lowered his head and placed his cards on the table.
1:12:15|1:12:24|[Lei Luo] pointed at the rose sitting on the side to give up his seat. Several people looked at [Lei Luo] in confusion, then all looked at the rose. The rose sat down generously without caring, and exchanged a glance with [A Hao].
1:12:42|1:12:54|[Wu Shihao] looked at Mei Gui with a smile that was not a smile, Mei Gui touched a card and smiled charmingly. [Wu Shihao] glanced at the cards spread out by Mei Gui and clapped his hands, Mei Gui stood up to make way for [Lei Luo].
1:12:58|1:13:2|[Lei Luo] gestured for the pig lard boys behind him to bring the tea set to the mahjong table. Upon seeing this, [A Hao] immediately stood up.
1:13:15|1:13:28|The rest of the people stood up one after another and picked up the teacups on the table. [A Hao] finished the tea in one gulp, rolled up his sleeves, picked up the fruit knife beside him, grabbed Fat Boy Chao's ear, and made a clean cut. Fat Boy Chao covered his ear in fear, trembling.
1:13:34|1:13:53|[Wu Shihao] glared and pointed at Fatty, cursing loudly. [Lei Luo] stood to the side quietly listening to [Wu Shihao]'s insults, his expression unreadable. After venting his anger, [Wu Shihao] casually threw the fruit knife onto the table, ran his hand through his hair, glanced at his gold watch, and then smiled at [Lei Luo] approaching.
1:13:58|1:14:3|[Lei Luo] showed a flawless smile to [A Hao], which disappeared without a trace the moment [A Hao] looked down.
1:14:11|1:14:26|[Wu Shihao] is standing outside the door, shaking off the cloth in his hand. He clenches his teeth and wipes all the blood off his fingers, then stuffs the cloth into his pocket. Leaning on a cane, he limps forward.
1:14:26|1:14:30|One ordinary noon, [A Hao] and his brothers were having a meal at home,
1:14:54|1:15:1|Upon hearing the door opening, A Ping anxiously looked up, holding a syringe in his hand.
1:15:53|1:15:59|A Qi crawled up the stairs with A Ping.
1:16:12|1:16:20|Da Wei pats Xiao Wei on the shoulder, and they exchange a knowing glance before hurrying upstairs to find Ah Ping. [Wu Shihao] sits low in a chair, tilting his head back with his eyes closed.
1:16:32|1:16:45|[Lei Luo] stood with his hands behind his back, his mouth downturned, his expression becoming more serious. He immediately called [A Hao] to arrange things. [A Hao] turned around with a cane in hand and saw [Lei Luo] devoutly worshipping in the ancestral hall.
1:16:51|1:16:58|[Wu Shihao] comfortingly patted Porky's shoulder and walked towards the ancestral hall, casually pointing to the side.
1:17:15|1:17:25|[Wu Shihao] showed no expression, just took out a cigarette from the pack and handed it to [Lei Luo]. [Lei Luo] didn't take the cigarette, he just smiled faintly and stared at [Wu Shihao] without moving. Mei Gui watched the silent game between the two.
1:17:25|1:17:35|Lei Luo chuckled, took the cigarette and held it in his mouth for a while. Wu Shihao naturally raised the lighter, and Lei Luo lit the cigarette with Wu Shihao's flame. The two blew smoke rings, lost in their own thoughts.
1:17:35|1:17:43|[Wu Shihao] looked at the Thousand-Hand Guanyin in front of him, then turned to look at [Lei Luo]. [Wu Shihao] fixed his gaze on [Lei Luo].
1:17:52|1:18:4|[Lei Luo] seemed to remember something. He waved his hand and leaned close to [A Hao]'s ear, whispering a few words. As [A Hao] listened, his brows furrowed slightly. The next day, [A Hao] brought Da Wei and Ah Qi to Bangkok, Thailand.
1:18:4|1:18:11|Four people lazily sat on a canoe, approaching their destination. Upon seeing the demolished house,
1:18:11|1:18:17|[A Hao] waved his hand to signal the boat to stop, and [Lei Luo] stood at the door with a flattering smile to welcome the four of them ashore.
1:18:19|1:18:24|A Hao hobbled into the room with a cane, and Dajia hurriedly led Wu Shihao into the room. Inside, a girl smiled shyly at Xiaowei.
1:19:10|1:19:17|A Hao invited Lei Luo to take a bath and relax tonight while the iron was hot. Lei Luo's slap left A Hao stunned, and just as his men were about to rush forward, they were forced back by A Qi pointing at their noses.
1:19:33|1:19:49|A Hao showed a fierce expression, pulled out a gun, Lei Luo quickly grabbed the gun and rushed forward, knocking down the intruder. Lei Luo used a cane to press hard on the intruder's neck, pinning him down. The situation was chaotic, with the dancers running away. Da Wei decisively shot and killed several henchmen who approached. A Qi twisted the wrist of a nearby person and kicked him out of the room.
1:19:49|1:20:10|Xiao Wei casually picked up a chair and smashed it towards the opponent, flipping him over. [Wu Shihao] snatched the gun from the home wrecker's hand, aimed at his head, but ended up picking up the gun stock and fiercely smashing it on the home wrecker's head. Xiao Wei raised half of a stool leg, vigilantly watching the thugs in front of him. Unexpectedly, the shy girl from earlier stabbed the home wrecker several times from behind, while thugs with sticks kept pouring into the room, surrounding [Wu Shihao] and his three companions.
1:20:10|1:20:18|[Wu Shihao] was not surprised by the world he had seen. He staggered to his feet, pointing the gun at the house demolition. Xiao Wei supported his lower back, his feet softened, and Da Wei held him up from behind.
1:20:23|1:20:30|[Wu Shihao] calmly scanned the surroundings, adjusted his hair, and kept the gun pointed at the head of the person wrecking the house.
1:20:35|1:20:39|Everyone was intimidated by A Hao's momentum and the gun pointed at the boss's head, so no one dared to make the first move.
1:20:39|1:20:46|A Qi seized the opportunity to fire a shot, taking advantage of the chaos inside the house. As the few men jumped onto a fishing boat outside the house, the thugs inside the house finally reacted.
1:20:47|1:20:52|A Hao and Lei Luo chased out of the door, shouting. Wu Shihao and Da Wei sat down to dismantle the house, while Ah Qi drove the boatman into the water and personally steered the boat.
1:20:53|1:21:3|Xiao Wei's face was pale, blood flowing from the wound. Da Wei tremblingly took out a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and took a deep drag before passing it to Xiao Wei's mouth.
1:21:8|1:21:13|Da Wei anxiously covered Xiao Wei's wound and then lifted Xiao Wei's face.
1:21:15|1:21:21|[Wu Shihao] sat by the boat, watching Xiao Wei's face full of pain.
1:21:34|1:21:46|A Hao turned his head with difficulty, Lei Luo tightly held A Hao's hand, Lei Luo nodded vigorously, choked up and couldn't speak, A Hao couldn't catch his breath, convulsed a few times and finally ran out of breath.
1:21:48|1:22:0|Da Wei held Xiao Wei's face and shouted desperately, [A Qi] raised his gun and couldn't help but roar, [Wu Shihao] turned away with tears in his eyes, and Da Wei shook Xiao Wei's shoulders.
1:22:5|1:22:15|[Wu Shihao] possessed and hugged Xiao Wei's head tightly, then stepped forward to pull Big Wei, who was going crazy and destroying the house, raised the gun, aimed at the house demolition, and pulled the trigger.
1:22:19|1:22:35|[A Hao] gritted his teeth and looked down at the demolished house, his heart in turmoil with countless thoughts. In the end, [A Hao] did not kill the demolished house. He tightly bound the demolished house and placed it at the bottom of the coffin, then carefully placed Xiao Wei's body on top of the demolished house.
1:22:35|1:22:42|In the midst of the wailing pleas and struggles of [A Hao], the coffin lid is closed and firmly nailed shut.
1:22:42|1:23:1|[Wu Shihao] stood respectfully by the coffin, wearing sunglasses and furrowing his brow. He took a deep drag of his cigarette and passed it to [A Hao], who took it and also took a deep drag before passing it to Big Wei. After taking a drag, Big Wei placed the remaining half cigarette on the coffin lid. This was their brothers' ritual of freedom.
1:23:1|1:23:13|Paper money fluttered into the sky, slowly drifting down in the wind. [A Hao] took out a roll of hundred-dollar bills, lit it with a lighter, and threw it into the coffin.
1:23:36|1:23:44|Hua Zai Rong stood up and caught up with Mei Gui, embracing her in his arms.
1:23:45|1:23:51|As soon as the words fell, Hua Zairong squinted and fiercely kissed the red lips of [Meigui].
1:23:56|1:24:18|Known worldwide for producing drugs such as heroin through local warlords and drug lords, the poppy fields here stretch endlessly. Under the leadership of local armed forces, A Hao arrived at the largest drug supplier, General Nai Mi's place, where smoke filled the air, numerous fires were burning, several shelters were set up in front of the fence, and soldiers in uniform were carrying guns.
1:24:18|1:24:24|On the guard post on the high platform, there are also dedicated personnel on duty. A Hao and his group dismount.
1:24:24|1:24:36|He looked around the largest drug base, while General Naimi's soldiers also stared at these outsiders without any courtesy. The captives were tied to crosses and whipped until their skin split open, with the surrounding soldiers treating it as a matter of course.
1:24:36|1:24:40|This is simply a primitive society full of bloody violence and lack of civilization.
1:24:40|1:24:44|[A Hao], [Lei Luo], and two others walked into General Naimi's reception room carrying gift boxes.
1:24:44|1:24:47|Accompanied by a soldier, [A Hao] and his group successfully entered General Naimi's reception room.
1:24:58|1:25:14|After listening to the final translation from his subordinate, General Naimi finally lifted his head, but his gaze never glanced at A Hao. General Naimi took out a cigar and walked to the other end of the long table under A Hao's gaze.
1:25:18|1:25:34|After standing still, he finally looked directly at [Wu Shihao], gesturing for him to come over to the chair next to him. [Wu Shihao] nodded with a smile, walked over with a cane, and stood next to General Naimi. The four soldiers in the room stood solemnly behind Naimi like sculptures. He lit a cigar, took a deep drag, tilted his head to look at [Wu Shihao], as General Naimi heard that [Wu Shihao] had come all the way from afar.
1:25:59|1:26:6|Taking his goods, [A Hao] was incredulous when he heard about it.
1:26:12|1:26:29|He also pointed ahead to [Wu Shihao], someone had already come with a deposit to discuss business with him. A graceful figure appeared in front of everyone, Rose was dressed in a black long dress, holding a bamboo woven wooden box and placed it in the center of the table before sitting down. Rose glanced lightly at [Wu Shihao] without saying a word.
1:26:29|1:26:40|[Wu Shihao] stood up and looked at the wooden box on the table, then glanced at General Naimi. General Naimi looked at [Wu Shihao] with a playful expression and didn't say anything. [Wu Shihao] pushed the wooden box in front of General Naimi and opened the lid.
1:26:56|1:27:9|[Wu Shihao] took a step forward and reached out his hand to General Naimi. His subordinate immediately translated [Wu Shihao]'s words to General Naimi, who remained unmoved, looking at [Wu Shihao] expressionlessly. Suddenly, General Naimi stood up and swept the wooden box to the ground.
1:27:21|1:27:46|The sudden voice made General Naimi stunned, only to see Rose gently push out a radio, from which came the voice of General Naimi's son. [A Hao] showed no panic, he took out a photo from his pocket and handed it to Naimi. Naimi frowned as he took the photo, seeing his wife and children smiling at the camera. Naimi's hand couldn't help but tremble, and that's how [A Hao] successfully obtained the drug distribution rights and became the largest drug distributor in Hong Kong.
1:27:46|1:28:8|He walked out of the Naimi base proudly with his two brothers. Hong Kong at night was always full of temptations and confusion. In a dance hall, Hunter was dancing wildly with several girls, while Fatty was holding a girl, lasciviously kissing her neck. Ah Ping was sweating profusely, pleading desperately with someone.
1:28:26|1:28:49|Fatty Chiu's henchman leads A Ping to a private room, where Hunter in the center of the sofa lewdly thrusts his crotch amidst laughter. A Ping, seeing this, turns to leave but is stopped by the henchman. Fatty Chiu holds A Ping's face, disdainfully wipes his hands.
1:29:28|1:29:49|Flattering, Hunter handed a glass of wine to A Hao. Hunter took the glass, while A Ping stared at it intently, his eyes filled with anticipation. Hunter raised his finger and made a serious gesture to keep quiet, then unzipped his pants. Amidst the laughter and whispers around him, Hunter aimed the glass below and urinated into it. It was only then that A Ping realized something was wrong, as he turned his gaze away and looked silently at the floor.
1:29:49|1:29:53|Hunter looked at Ah Ping and handed over the cup of wine filled with urine.
1:30:40|1:30:59|A Ping suddenly sprayed urine on the sofa, dropped the wine glass and ran away. Ma Zai hooked A Ping to the ground, dragged him and threw him to the card seat again. Hunter, furious, picked up a bottle and walked to A Ping, smashing it on his forehead. He grabbed A Ping's collar, banged his head hard on the coffee table in front of him. A Ping was thrown aside, bleeding profusely and gasping for breath.
1:31:1|1:31:9|Hunter stood in front of Ah Ping, looking down at him from a high vantage point. [Wu Shihao] was still a man of courage at heart, and he suddenly threw himself forward to hug Hunter's leg.
1:31:9|1:31:14|A Hao firmly held on and refused to let go, Fat Boy kicked A Ping away, and handed a fire extinguisher to Hunter.
1:31:14|1:31:26|[A Ping] struggled to get up again, only to be hit on the head with a fire extinguisher by [Hunter]. [Wu Shihao] leaned on a cane, leading with great authority and [Ah Qi] anxiously through the hospital corridor. Without any hesitation, [Wu Shihao] completely ignored the approaching Piggy.
1:31:26|1:31:44|Rushing into the ward, [Qing Jie] sat beside the hospital bed with a look of sorrow. [Ah Ping]'s head was wrapped up like a rice dumpling, lying on the bed unconscious. [Lei Luo] stood by with hands crossed, watching [Wu Shihao] step by step towards [Ah Ping]. [Ah Ping] had her eyes tightly shut, with blood still oozing from the gauze. [Wu Shihao] pursed his lips, looking deeply pained.
1:31:54|1:32:1|[Qing Jie] closed her eyes in sadness, tears streaming uncontrollably, leaving [Wu Shihao] at a loss for words. He couldn't bear to look at [Ah Ping] any longer.
1:32:3|1:32:11|[Wu Shihao] paced with concern, his eyes turning sharp the moment he saw [Lei Luo].
1:32:11|1:32:17|[Lei Luo] also felt the gaze of [A Hao] and raised his head slightly.
1:32:43|1:32:49|[Lei Luo] grabbed [Wu Shihao]'s arm from behind, trying to calm [Wu Shihao] down. Without hesitation, [Wu Shihao] broke free from [Lei Luo]'s restraint and turned to face [Lei Luo].
1:32:49|1:32:54|[Lei Luo] carefully closed the door of the ward, straightened his clothes, and looked helplessly at [A Hao].
1:33:5|1:33:13|[Wu Shihao] disdainfully leaned on his cane, took a few steps, and then turned around.
1:33:47|1:33:56|[Wu Shihao] sneered, took a quick step forward and walked away. [Wu Shihao]'s expression turned into endless worry, then turned back and hurriedly rushed into the ward.
1:34:28|1:34:39|This piece of news hit [Lei Luo] like a ton of bricks, leaving him breathless. The day has finally arrived. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), a law enforcement agency dedicated to combating corruption, has been established.
1:35:57|1:36:11|During this period, both A Hao and Lei Luo were investigated and questioned by the Independent Commission Against Corruption. The ICAC conducted a thorough background check on the subjects of the investigation, showing a determined attitude to never give up, finally awakening everyone.
1:36:23|1:36:30|Sir Zhou lay weakly in bed, and when he saw [Lei Luo] sitting by the bed, he struggled to remove the oxygen mask and waved his hand for his daughter to leave.
1:36:30|1:36:36|[Lei Luo] bent down and gently held Sir Zhou's hand.
1:36:38|1:36:45|Sir Zhou patted [Lei Luo] on the shoulder, and [Lei Luo] in turn grabbed Sir Zhou's hand.
1:36:54|1:37:20|Hunter walked out of the door as usual with a briefcase in hand. His car was less than 10 meters away from the gate. Just as he bent down to pick up the keys, the car suddenly exploded, with flames shooting up into the sky. Hunter was thrown to the side by the huge impact. Zhuoyouzai, Dawei, and Aqi stood outside the gate looking bored. Inside the house, [Lei Luo] sat expressionless on the sofa, with Mei Gui in black standing beside him. Upon hearing the noise, [Lei Luo] stood up and straightened his clothes.
1:37:20|1:37:22|Look at [A Hao] walking down the stairs.
1:37:48|1:37:54|Lei Luo's gaze has been following A Hao, and he sees A Hao walk to the edge of the sofa, adjust the cushion on the sofa, and sit down.
1:38:16|1:38:24|Lei Luo's expression was mixed with bitterness and helplessness. He frowned and looked at A Hao, then couldn't help but take a few steps, one hand in his pocket, the other hand holding a wine glass pointing at A Hao.
1:38:32|1:38:40|Lei Luo's brow furrowed even tighter, but A Hao remained unfazed, lifting his head defiantly.
1:38:50|1:38:55|A Hao slammed his right leg heavily on the coffee table and looked at Lei Luo mockingly.
1:39:36|1:39:45|[Lei Luo] placed the wine glass on the coffee table, spread his arms facing A Hao, who coldly chuckled and ignored him.
1:40:1|1:40:15|Rose looked at A Hao with the gun pointed down, smiled and turned to [Lei Luo], slightly raising her chin. Time went back to the past, a young A Hao sat in the kitchen with Ah Hua, took out a few cookies and handed them to Ah Hua.
1:41:22|1:41:47|[Lei Luo] turned his mouth up slightly and expressionlessly towards Mei Gui, then without looking back, he walked out. Mei Gui glanced slightly at [Lei Luo], and A Hao's tense expression instantly turned into exhaustion as the door closed. He closed his eyes and patted Qing Jie's leg, and Qing Jie comfortingly patted his arm before leaving. A Hao covered his eyes and leaned against the sofa, unable to hide the turmoil on his face any longer.
1:41:47|1:42:1|The next day, [Lei Luo]'s wife Xue'er walked out of the house with their two children. The driver and servant packed the luggage into the car in an orderly manner. Suddenly, a car stopped in the courtyard, and A Hao hurriedly walked up.
1:42:4|1:42:18|Xue'er got on the car with the child, looking out the window with a worried expression. Xue'er looked at [Lei Luo] without saying a word. The long-standing tacit understanding between the couple had already let [Lei Luo] know what his wife wanted to express. He glanced at Zhu Youzai as if he had made a decision, then opened the car door.
1:42:39|1:42:58|[Lei Luo] looked at Fatso without saying a word. That night, [A Hao] also sent his wife and child to the pier. The child was playing around, oblivious. [A Hao] reached out to Qing, pulled her into his arms. Qing tightly held onto [A Hao]'s shoulders, crying uncontrollably. [A Hao] could only comfort her by patting her back.
1:42:58|1:43:11|The boat sailed away, Qing stood at the bow, looking back at A Hao on the shore with reluctance. A Hao stood on the dock with a cane, watching his wife and children sail away. No one knew what would happen tonight, but once the decision was made, there was no turning back.
1:43:11|1:43:22|Before this, A Hao had to send away his last concern in this troubled place. A Hao visited his brother A Ping in the hospital again, where A Ping lay on the bed unconscious with an oxygen mask on.
1:43:23|1:43:46|At night, A Hao, Da Wei, and A Qi sat at a roadside stall eating noodles. A Hao carefully poured beer into the cups for his two brothers, then lit a cigarette. He took a drag, glanced ahead silently, sighed, and passed the cigarette to A Qi beside him. A Qi took the cigarette, took a deep drag, then passed it to Da Wei across from him. Da Wei took the cigarette and finished it with the last puff.
1:43:46|1:43:51|The three of them stood up, Ah Qi threw the money on the table, waved his hand to signal the boss to come and collect the money.
1:43:51|1:43:56|Rose, dressed in a black trench coat, followed them with deep affection and coldness.
1:44:21|1:44:37|Hunter opened the car door and drunkenly ordered Xie to drive properly. The four of them were blinded by the high beams of the car behind them, and then their car was blocked by two cars, one black and one white. Hunter realized the situation and ordered Xie to drive. Xie started the car in a panic, and a bulldozer suddenly appeared on the left, charging straight at the sedan and lifting it up.
1:44:37|1:44:43|Several people in the car were cursing loudly, demanding to be let out. Through a crack, Hengtian saw [Wu Shihao] sitting in the driver's seat of the forklift. He lifted the forklift to the highest point with a cold expression on his face.
1:45:0|1:45:26|[A Hao] ignored the shouting inside the car, he forcefully turned the steering wheel to change the direction of the forklift. Hunter desperately smashed the car door, but the door remained intact. [A Hao] stabilized the vehicle, lifted the sedan, stepped on the gas pedal and drove forward. Two sedans followed closely behind, amidst continuous yelling and threats. Suddenly, [A Hao] slammed on the brakes, causing the sedan to lose balance and fall to the ground. [A Hao] quickly caught up and flipped the sedan over, leaving Hunter and the other three inside the car dizzy and disoriented.
1:45:26|1:45:49|Continuing, [A Hao] once again lifted the sedan with the excavator and rammed it towards the building in front. Hunter looked at [A Hao] in fear and disbelief, watching the sedan crash into the building. The wall instantly collapsed, with bricks falling onto the roof of Hunter's car. [A Hao] turned on the excavator's headlights, got out of the driver's seat, stood at the front of the vehicle, and started shooting at the sedan. Hunter and his group were so scared that they could only cover their heads and dodge.
1:45:49|1:46:3|[Wu Shihao] stood in front of the car, glaring angrily at Hunter, stopped shooting, then raised his pistol with a fierce look. Hunter raised his arms in fear, and the sudden sound of gunfire interrupted [Wu Shihao]'s plan. Yan Tong and his men arrived to support Hunter.
1:46:3|1:46:7|Dawei quickly started the car and leaned half of his body out to shoot at Yantong with Aqi.
1:46:7|1:46:23|[Wu Shihao] fired several shots towards Yan Tong before quickly jumping off the bulldozer and falling to the side of the road. Mei Gui and her men arrived in time, blocking Yan Tong's path. Everyone got out of their vehicles to find cover and a fierce gun battle ensued. With Yan Tong's firepower being so strong, Mei Gui was unable to advance, leading to a stalemate situation.
1:46:23|1:46:46|Hunter took advantage of the chaos to climb out of the car, and Wu Shihao quickly got up from the ground. Da Wei's car happened to stop in front of Wu Shihao. After climbing out of the car, Hunter immediately ran to Yan Tong's side and asked for a gun. He used the car door as cover and desperately shot at Wu Shihao. Just as Wu Shihao was getting settled, Da Wei hit the gas pedal and reversed. Seeing this, Hunter immediately climbed into the driver's seat, and Yan Tong also got into the car.
1:46:47|1:47:11|The street once again staged a chase scene, with a row of cars roaring past, the sound of gunfire piercing the air. [A Qi] pulled out a handgun from his waist and handed it to [Wu Shihao]. [Wu Shihao] quickly loaded the gun and leaned out of the window to shoot ahead. Da Wei's car was in reverse, facing Hunter who was chasing closely. As the two cars approached each other, in the midst of chaos, Hunter shot Da Wei, causing him to instinctively lean back. [Wu Shihao] steadied the steering wheel and pulled away from Hunter's car.
1:47:13|1:47:19|Suddenly, a strong light, a truck drove straight towards A Hao's car, the huge impact force caused the car to flip several times in the air before coming to a stop.
1:47:19|1:47:27|Banknotes are scattered all over the car, and the fat guy in the truck looks a bit panicked as he watches the overturned car, then reveals a terrifying smile.
1:47:27|1:47:48|[Rose] overtook and abruptly turned in front of Hunter, forcing the vehicles behind to start shooting at [Rose]. [Rose] possessed someone and got out of the car from the passenger side, shooting back while running forward. Fatty hid on the other side of the truck, shooting [Rose] in the arm. Then Hunter shot [Rose] from behind, causing [Rose] to fall to the ground. [Wu Shihao] and [Ah Qi] finally woke up in the overturned car.
1:47:48|1:48:10|[Wu Shihao] just squinted and turned his head, only to see [Rose] lying not far away, propping up her body and looking at him. [Wu Shihao] couldn't believe the scene in front of him. [Rose] smiled as tears rolled down her cheeks. She looked deeply into [Wu Shihao]'s eyes for the last time, then stood up and started shooting at Hunter and the others. Without surprise, she was shot through by bullets in front of her, as if she saw [Wu Shihao] for the first time again.
1:48:12|1:48:22|[Wu Shihao] couldn't help but open his mouth wide and let out a painful roar as he watched [Meigui] get shot through the chest in a bid to buy herself one last second.
1:48:22|1:48:34|Even [Rose] did not drop the gun in her hand. She finally couldn't hold on anymore and fell backwards, [Wu Shihao] also couldn't support his body and fell weakly to one side.
1:48:35|1:48:42|Fatty, Hunter, and Yan Tong, holding guns, walked forward in a victorious manner.
1:48:42|1:48:51|[Wu Shihao] kicked open the car door in the glare of the fire and struggled to climb out. Taking advantage of the three men's distraction, he pulled out a handgun and wildly fired shots towards the opposite side as if venting his anger.
1:48:51|1:49:4|[A Hao] dragged the angry [Wu Shihao], rushing into an alley amidst a hail of bullets, with Hunter and others closely following. Fatso and his men were the first to charge in, leading a group of people to chase after them. Hunter stopped the police behind him, demanding that they
1:49:11|1:49:30|A Qi took the key, opened a safe in the room, stuffed the cash and gold bars into a black backpack, [Ma Dongmei] opened a drawer, took out a handgun and tucked it behind his waist. He then opened a painting on the wall, took out a shotgun, and smashed the glass window by pushing down a shelf behind him. [Fei Zai Chao] heard the noise and followed alertly. [Ma Dongmei] grabbed A Qi by the collar.
1:49:37|1:49:41|A Qi doesn't speak, he can only express his dissatisfaction through shaking his head and roaring. [Wu Shihao] slapped him twice to make him calm down.
1:49:41|1:49:50|Grabbing the back of his collar, she firmly embraced him on her shoulder. Ah Qi watched as [Wu Shihao] walked towards the door, with [Fat Boy Chao] already arriving outside the iron gate.
1:49:50|1:49:54|And A Qi still couldn't let go of [Wu Shihao], following behind him with a black bag.
1:50:0|1:50:16|[Fatty Chiu]'s men started to open the iron gate. [A Hao] was furious, aimed at the gate and fired a shot. As [A Hao] was reloading, he saw [Fatty Chiu] and fired another shot. [Fatty Chiu] scrambled and ran deep into the alley. [A Hao] calmly followed, reloading and shooting in one breath.
1:50:25|1:50:32|[Fatty Chiu] panicked and ran into a long corridor, he was scared out of his wits by [Ng Sei Ho], frantically pounding on the iron door at the end.
1:50:36|1:50:54|[Fatty Chiu] looked around and found that the only way to go was through the narrow gap between two buildings, less than half a meter wide. He gritted his teeth and crawled over. [Wu Shihao] loaded the pistol and approached [Fatty Chiu] like a cat chasing a mouse. A gunshot rang in his ear, scaring [Fatty Chiu] to shiver uncontrollably. He trembled towards the cement pillar, inching forward step by step.
1:50:54|1:50:59|[Fatty Chiu] was scared by the gunshots, his legs trembling badly, trying to reach out to support a nearby billboard.
1:50:59|1:51:7|[A Hao] fired a shot at the billboard, scaring [Fatso] into pulling back his hand. He struggled to maintain his balance and couldn't help but turn around to glance at [A Hao].
1:51:7|1:51:11|[Fatty Chiu] couldn't bear the sound of gunfire anymore, so he jumped down.
1:51:11|1:51:17|A Hao looked coldly at the shattered body of Fat Boy Chao, finally lowering his gun. Lei Luo led a group of people rushing into the alleyway.
1:51:41|1:51:49|Facing the stern Chief Zonghua, the riot police officers retreated to the sides, making way for a path.
1:51:50|1:51:57|[Lei Luo] led his men straight through, gesturing sternly, and rushed into the alley with his subordinates. Yan Tong held a gun and hid in a corner, quietly observing Lei Luo not far away.
1:51:58|1:52:9|[Lei Luo] cautiously climbed up to a terrace with Piggy Oil, where clotheslines were filled with hanging clothes, the cluttered garments and flickering lights greatly affecting [Lei Luo]'s vision. He squinted his eyes and proceeded carefully.
1:52:9|1:52:20|Not far away, Yan Tong aimed his gun at [Lei Luo] slowly. Unaware, [Lei Luo] was still moving through a laundry area, and when he looked closely at a balcony upstairs, there was no movement on the dim balcony.
1:52:20|1:52:23|[Lei Luo] stared for a while, feeling that he didn't see anything.
1:52:23|1:52:29|Turning to the other side, a figure suddenly stood up at the balcony, raised a hand and fired a shot, causing [Lei Luo] to stagger.
1:52:29|1:52:57|[Lei Luo] immediately sensed the direction of the gunshots, pushed aside a piece of clothing, and fired a shot towards the balcony. Piggy, alert, turned around and saw Yan Tong aiming a gun at [Lei Luo]. Piggy quickly pulled [Lei Luo] behind him, shooting back while protecting [Lei Luo] as they retreated. Yan Tong was hit by a bullet, blood splattering on the wall. Only then did [Lei Luo] realize that Piggy had two bloody bullet holes on his body. He quickly embraced Piggy's neck and gently helped him lie down.
1:53:8|1:53:23|Porky's eyes rolled up, lifeless, and [Lei Luo] stared blankly. This brother who had been through thick and thin with him, ultimately died in this filthy village to save him, leaving Lei Luo overwhelmed with grief and anger.
1:53:23|1:53:35|[Lei Luo] could only slowly close his eyes at this moment, his expression stern as he lowered his head and then looked at the piglet in his arms. His eyes turned red as he slowly placed the piglet's body aside.
1:53:35|1:53:42|He picked up the gun under the cover of night and slowly stood up, something in his heart had already begun to waver.
1:53:42|1:54:4|Perhaps now he could understand [A Hao]'s thoughts and actions. [A Hao] limped through the alley with a gun in hand. Hunter retreated from another path and saw [A Hao] standing still on the side. [A Hao] reacted first, raising the gun and shooting wildly at Hunter. Hunter rushed a few steps to the corner, and as soon as [A Hao] peeked out, he was shot back by a bullet. Suddenly, Hunter's subordinate Peter...
1:54:4|1:54:15|A Hao kept shooting from the side of Lei Luo, while Hunter took the opportunity to hide elsewhere. Lei Luo was caught in a crossfire and temporarily unable to escape. Hunter and A Hao approached Lei Luo, but found him nowhere to be seen upon closer inspection.
1:54:15|1:54:30|Peter raised his head, and [A Hao] on the high balcony had already aimed at the angle, shooting a bullet towards his forehead. [A Hao] forced Hunter to a corner with several more shots. Hunter leaned against a security window, loading his gun while aiming at [A Hao]'s position. He kept provoking [A Hao], challenging him to come and go as he pleased.
1:54:35|1:54:42|Hunter turned around fiercely and fired several shots from the balcony where [Wu Shihao] was standing, causing sparks to fly and the anti-theft window to fall down.
1:54:42|1:54:48|[Wu Shihao] was tangled in the complex railing wires, when suddenly A Qi rushed over and tackled Hunter.
1:54:48|1:55:8|A Hao raised his fist and desperately smashed it towards Hunter's face. Hunter kicked A Qi down the stairs, then shot A Qi in the chest. A Qi lay on the side, his body convulsing uncontrollably, blood continuously flowing from the corner of his mouth. Lei Luo hovered in mid-air, once again helplessly watching his last brother sacrifice in front of him, reaching out weakly to grasp at nothingness.
1:55:8|1:55:23|Hunter walked up to Ah Qi, raised his head with a sinister smile to look at Wu Shihao, but the gun was once again pointed at Ah Qi's head. Ah Qi widened his eyes, looked at Wu Shihao with a smile, and his eyes sparkled with a light that had never been seen before. Hunter shot Ah Qi in the neck, and Ah Qi died on the spot.
1:55:23|1:55:30|[Wu Shihao] clenched his fists tightly, tears streaming down his face. Hunter raised his gun, sneering as he aimed at [Wu Shihao],
1:55:30|1:55:37|[Lei Luo] shot Hunter in the wrist, demanding him to drop the gun. Hunter, holding his wrist, ran into the alley without looking back.
1:55:38|1:56:1|A Hao finally struggled to fall from the half-height railing, pounced beside Ah Qi, [Lei Luo] stared at the direction where Hunter escaped, then lowered the gun to look at [A Hao]. [A Hao] struggled to grab Ah Qi's shoulder, looked at him firmly for a while, then hesitantly touched his face. This was his last brother, now also leaving him. [A Hao] bent down again to touch Ah Qi's face, closing his eyes for him.
1:56:4|1:56:9|[A Hao] still touched Ah Qi's face, furrowed his brows, turned his head away, not wanting [Lei Luo] to see his expression.
1:56:9|1:56:20|After a while, he seemed to come to his senses, struggling to get up with [Lei Luo]'s shoulder for support. Without warning, [A Hao] swung a punch at [Lei Luo], who lay on the steps unable to get up for a moment.
1:56:38|1:57:2|[Lei Luo] stumbled behind [A Hao], trying to stop him. Hunter, clutching his wrist, desperately slammed into any door on the rooftop but to no avail. He then turned towards the edge of the rooftop, hesitating at the height from the rooftop to the ground. Hunter continued to walk inside, panting. Suddenly, the iron door of the rooftop was blown open by the wind. Hunter, with a premonition, turned his head and saw [A Hao] standing at the doorway like a god of death.
1:57:3|1:57:11|Hunter fired several shots at [A Hao] in a panic, but [A Hao] remained unfazed. He raised his hand and shot Hunter in the abdomen, causing Hunter to fall to the ground, with the handgun also falling to the side.
1:57:11|1:57:16|Hunter desperately crawled towards the pistol, [A Hao] glared angrily. He rushed to Hunter and kicked the pistol away, then aimed at Hunter's hand and fired a shot.
1:57:20|1:57:28|Hunter rolled his eyes and cursed non-stop, still using his identity as a British police chief to threaten [A Hao]. Deep down, Hunter looked down on [A Hao].
1:57:45|1:58:7|He watched the fierce god in front of him without moving. [Lei Luo] picked up the gun kicked aside by [A Hao] and aimed it at [A Hao]. [A Hao] paid no attention to [Lei Luo] at all, gritting his teeth as he pressed the gun against Hunter's forehead.
1:58:27|1:58:41|[A Hao] remains unmoved by [Lei Luo]'s words, he continues to stare at Hunter with his eyes fixed on him. Hunter also keeps his eyes on [A Hao], unable to guess the thoughts of this killer. [A Hao] lowers his gun and slowly raises his head towards [Lei Luo].
1:58:41|1:58:52|[Lei Luo] put down the gun upon seeing the situation, watching as [A Hao] walked towards him step by step. [A Hao] looked at [Lei Luo] with eyes filled with anger, sorrow, and disappointment.
1:58:57|1:59:2|A Hao didn't look back, just slightly raised the muzzle and took down Hunter.
1:59:2|1:59:7|[Lei Luo] was not surprised by the outcome. He put his hand on A Hao's shoulder and buried his head deeply.
1:59:7|1:59:16|Then he raised his head as if he had breathed a sigh of relief, looking at A Hao for a long time. [Lei Luo] slowly raised his gun and fired a shot at his own arm resting on A Hao.
1:59:16|1:59:20|In A Hao's knowing gaze, he weakly lowered his eyes.
1:59:20|1:59:37|[Lei Luo] wiped the fingerprints off the gun, glanced at [A Hao], walked to Hunter's body, squatted down and placed the gun in Hunter's hand. [A Hao] stood still, with a hint of tears in his eyes. He knew in the end, [Lei Luo] was still on his side.
1:59:37|1:59:42|In order to save him, A Hao sacrificed his own arm, and finally the debt of this leg was paid off.
1:59:42|1:59:49|Several police cars are parked downstairs, and the police officers rush down nervously towards the building.
1:59:49|2:0:5|[Lei Luo] and A Hao, just like before, leaned against the edge of the rooftop smoking. Both of them remained silent, probably each with their own thoughts about the outcome of this matter. They both knew that this might be the last time they smoked together. The cold moonlight bathed the entire rooftop, signaling that the darkness of Hong Kong would eventually pass.
2:0:5|2:0:14|At the alley entrance, the riot police were ready. A Hao was escorted out in handcuffs by Lei Luo and others. His imprisonment marked the end of an era in Hong Kong.
2:0:14|2:0:22|In 1974, [A Hao] was arrested for drug trafficking and sentenced to 30 years in prison. [Lei Luo] fled overseas and never set foot in Hong Kong again.
2:0:22|2:0:33|The highest-ranking corrupt fugitive, Gebo, was also extradited from Spain to Hong Kong for sentencing, and the corrupt empire sheltered under the colonial system collapsed. The era of corruption in Hong Kong came to an end.
2:0:33|2:0:42|The film is about to say goodbye to you here. Thank you for listening. Stay tuned for a post-credits scene.
2:1:59|2:2:11|In this post-credits scene, set in Vancouver in 1991, a middle-aged man sits on a sofa, quietly watching the news on TV in a luxurious home.
2:2:19|2:2:34|A middle-aged Lei Luo stared at the TV screen without moving for a long time, with tall buildings standing by the Hong Kong bay, quiet and bustling. A Hao stood quietly on the deck with a cane, looking into the distance. Behind him stood his wife and children, silently watching this former overlord of Hong Kong.
2:2:37|2:2:44|The son respectfully handed the mobile phone to [A Hao], and [A Hao] slowly took it with a slight turn of his body.
2:3:57|2:4:10|[Lei Luo] raised his eyebrows with a weathered face, he waited for a while but did not receive a response.
2:4:10|2:4:14|[Lei Luo] looked at the microphone, then slowly raised his head and set the microphone aside.
2:4:17|2:4:28|On the other side, [A Hao] gently moved the big brother's hand away from his ear and placed it against his chest. He looked up at the opposite side, seeming to smile, but also as if he sighed, as if recalling something.
2:4:29|2:4:34|He will never see [Lei Luo] again, this phone call has fulfilled his wish.
2:4:35|2:4:40|[Wu Shihao] turned around and suddenly realized that the ones standing behind him were no longer his wife and child.
2:4:45|2:4:58|He saw A Hua and A Qi, saw Da Wei, Xiao Wei, [A Mei] and A Hua smiling at him, [A Qi] also waved to him, Xiao Wei with a cigarette in his mouth, still looking nonchalant.
