0:1:51|0:1:58|On the Jinpu Railway's Linzhuo Branch Line, which was occupied by the Japanese, a train carrying looted coal was speeding along.
0:1:58|0:2:10|Suddenly, several dark figures swiftly climbed onto the train. They were the workers coming to reclaim the coal - [Peng Liang], [Lu Han], and [Xiao Po].
0:2:10|0:2:14|At this moment, the Japanese invaders spotted them, and [Peng Liang] blew the whistle to sound the alarm.
0:2:14|0:2:16|[Lu Han] heard the alarm and immediately alerted [Wang Qiang].
0:2:16|0:2:18|[Xiao Po] quickly turned around, and a Japanese soldier pounced towards him.
0:2:25|0:2:29|Beside him, [Lu Han] lifted a piece of coal and knocked out the Japanese soldier.
0:2:29|0:2:38|Another Japanese soldier blew the whistle, and the train came to a sudden stop.
0:2:38|0:2:42|Coal miners jumped off the train one after another and ran towards the wilderness.
0:2:42|0:2:44|The Japanese soldiers were chasing and shooting at the same time.
0:2:44|0:2:47|A coal miner was shot and fell to the ground, being pinned down by the Japanese soldiers.
0:2:53|0:2:59|[Xiao Po] ran desperately towards a dense jungle by the railway.
0:2:59|0:3:9|After running into the jungle, Lu Han found himself unable to run any further, gasping for breath incessantly.
0:3:9|0:3:17|The Japanese soldiers ran into the woods, using the tips of their guns to push aside the grass, searching around for a while.
0:3:28|0:3:33|A Japanese soldier gestured, and they left the jungle.
0:3:33|0:3:40|Liu Hong and [Xiao Po] finally poked their heads out of the pit, making sure that the Japanese soldiers had gone far away.
0:3:40|0:3:53|[Xiao Po] excitedly asked Liu Hong, who nodded. They came out of the pit and quietly walked towards the edge of the jungle.
0:3:56|0:4:4|Under the cover of night, they arrived at the town, where a group of Japanese cavalry soldiers galloped past.
0:4:4|0:4:10|Liu Hong and [Xiao Po] hid behind a mud wall, avoiding the patrol team.
0:4:10|0:4:14|Next, they climbed over the wall and jumped into Wang Qiang's yard.
0:4:14|0:4:21|A column of Japanese soldiers' train billowed steam as it passed on the distant railway, they hid under the courtyard wall.
0:4:21|0:4:25|After the train passed, [Lu Han] ran to the front of the house in the yard and knocked on the window.
0:4:33|0:4:37|The light in the room turned on, and the guerrilla fighter [Wang Qiang] opened the door.
0:4:42|0:4:44|They walked into the house together, with [Wang Qiang] calling out for Xiaopo.
0:4:47|0:4:50|Xiao Po went out.
0:4:54|0:4:57|[Wang Qiang] sat down.
0:5:30|0:5:33|Wang Qiang heard the movement outside the house, quickly got up, opened the door, and saw Lu Han and Peng Liang.
0:6:2|0:6:7|[Liu Hong] had his arms around [Lu Han] and [Peng Liang]'s shoulders, and the three of them smiled as they looked at each other.
0:6:7|0:6:13|[Lu Han] pulled out the Beretta pistol from [Liu Hong]'s waist, his expression filled with excitement.
0:6:31|0:6:36|[Wang Qiang] said, and then sat down at the square table with [Liu Hong], [Lu Han], and [Peng Liang].
0:7:3|0:7:11|The scene shifts to the foreign goods yard at the town's train station, where workers are carrying heavy goods on their backs.
0:7:11|0:7:15|The Japanese bank manager Yamaguchi stood at the entrance of the foreign bank, leaning on crutches, urging the workers to work.
0:7:15|0:7:26|After he finished speaking, he bumped into [Wang Qiang] who was walking out.
0:7:26|0:7:35|[Wang Qiang] urged the workers on, then walked over to a large truck carrying goods to help a worker lift the cargo onto his shoulder.
0:7:35|0:7:45|Later, [Lu Han] draped a shoulder cloth over himself and hoisted a long straw-wrapped item, heading towards the freight car of the train.
0:7:45|0:7:51|[Wang Qiang] carried the goods to the front of the carriage and loaded them into the carriage.
0:7:51|0:7:57|Later, he looked up and glanced into the carriage, where the camera swept across to reveal that the carriage was filled with firearms and ammunition.
0:8:0|0:8:10|At this moment, the crew member closed the car door and secured the latch, then walked up to [Wang Qiang].
0:8:10|0:8:16|[Wang Qiang] noticed that the carriage carrying arms was numbered 1263, and he fell into deep thought.
0:8:16|0:8:23|That night, Liu Hong led [Wang Qiang], Peng Liang, Xiao Po, [Lu Han] and others to the side of the railway.
0:8:23|0:8:28|The Japanese train approached, and Lu Han, hidden in the bushes beside the railway, closely watched the train carriages.
0:8:30|0:8:42|When the carriage No. 1263 carrying ammunition was approaching, [Lu Han] rushed out, leaped up, and ascended onto the train.
0:8:42|0:8:50|She pulled out a gun and quietly looked into the carriage from the car door window. At this moment, a Japanese officer walked towards the carriage door.
0:8:50|0:8:51|[Liu Hong] hurriedly moved his body.
0:8:53|0:9:9|The Japanese officer glanced outside the car door, then pulled down the curtains inside and left. [Liu Hong] tucked the gun into her waist, and crossed over to car 1263 from the carriage, gripping the protrusion outside the carriage with force, her feet on the outer edge of the carriage, sweating profusely.
0:9:17|0:9:30|Finally, he climbed to the outside of the door of carriage 1263, used pliers to break the iron wire wrapped around the door latch, opened the carriage door, and flipped into the carriage.
0:9:30|0:9:36|[Liu Hong] threw bundles of guns and boxes of ammunition out of the train carriage.
0:9:36|0:9:42|At the railway silver line, [Wang Qiang], [Lu Han], [Peng Liang] and others waited, quickly picking up the firearms and ammunition dropped by [Liu Hong].
0:9:47|0:9:53|They excitedly opened the ammunition box, took out the guns inside, and smiled at each other.
0:9:53|0:10:1|Lu Han and Wang Qiang were very excited as they opened the ammunition box.
0:10:18|0:10:33|[Wang Qiang] finished collecting the confiscated pistol, [Lu Han] walked to the other side while smoking, [Wang Qiang] followed.
0:10:33|0:10:44|The armored train is moving on the railway tracks, inside the carriage are the Japanese soldiers [Kobayashi] and [Gangcun].
0:10:44|0:10:47|Xiao Lin and Gangcun sat down at the table together.
0:10:49|0:10:52|In the courtyard of the special operations team, several anti-Japanese activists were shot dead by the Japanese army.
0:11:16|0:11:21|[Jiangcun] saw this scene in the office of the special operations team, with a sly smile on his face.
0:11:21|0:11:31|He turned around and walked up to the coal worker who had been caught earlier for trying to steal coal, only to find him badly beaten by the Japanese invaders.
0:11:31|0:11:38|[Jiangcun] took out a box of cigarettes and placed it in front of him, but the coal miner turned his head and refused his cigarette.
0:11:38|0:11:42|[Jiangcun] had to take out his own lighter, but the coal miners remained unmoved.
0:11:44|0:12:11|Lu Han was just whipped by the Miracle Breaker, and blood flowed from his cheeks and mouth. Suddenly, gunshots were heard from outside. In the early morning, a large number of Japanese soldiers arrived at the town and conducted patrols and searches near the foreign firms at the train station. The Japanese cavalry team charged down the street, causing the villagers to scatter and flee.
0:12:40|0:12:44|Paused in front of [Gang Village], then bid farewell and left.
0:12:44|0:12:52|The scene shifts to the market in Zaozhuang, where Lu Han leads his troops to conduct a search.
0:12:52|0:12:58|Lu Han slapped the roadside vendor, causing the fruits on the vendor's stall to fall to the ground and be trampled to a pulp by the Japanese soldiers.
0:13:1|0:13:25|Hearing the firecrackers in the distance, [Lu Han] stopped in his tracks. Many people ran towards the sound of the firecrackers. It turned out to be a coal exploration operation by the Railway Guerrilla Team. Workers were loading coal into baskets, using the operation as a cover for their activities, and loudly pointing out trees.
0:13:25|0:13:30|They warmly welcomed the customers, enjoying a good reputation, when suddenly a guerrilla fighter rushed in.
0:13:33|0:13:45|The Japanese soldiers led by Lu Han stormed into the village, and Wang Qiang bowed to them with a fake smile while holding a lute.
0:13:45|0:13:49|Liu Hong, dressed as a boss, stood in the courtyard with [Lu Han], while [Wang Qiang] walked towards Jiangcun.
0:13:57|0:14:5|Lu Han rejected him, looked at Tang Zhan with suspicion, and then led the Japanese soldiers away with a wolf dog.
0:14:5|0:14:10|[Xiao Po] saw the Japanese soldiers leaving and happily started playing the soil pipa in his hands.
0:14:10|0:14:17|At this moment, the newly appointed political commissar of the railway guerrilla team, Li Zheng, walked into the reconnaissance battle, and Liu Hong was surprised to see him.
0:14:26|0:14:30|Liu Hong led Li Zheng into the room as she spoke.
0:14:30|0:14:34|After they entered the house, [Wang Qiang] turned around to check the situation outside the door and then followed into the room.
0:14:34|0:14:34|Liu Hong took out the order letter hidden in his hat.
0:14:57|0:15:10|This appointment appoints Liu Hong, [Wang Qiang], as the government captain of the railway guerrilla team of the [Lu Han] Military Region, and Li Zheng as the political commissar.
0:15:13|0:15:15|Night has fallen.
0:16:4|0:16:7|[Lu Han] stood up, wanting to toast him a drink.
0:16:22|0:16:24|[Lu Han] filled a glass with wine and drank it all in one gulp.
0:16:37|0:16:40|[Lu Han] kindly took out an apple flute for him.
0:16:51|0:16:53|[Lu Han] pulled out a gun.
0:16:55|0:16:57|Li Zheng straightened the two chopsticks on the table.
0:17:41|0:17:47|Li Zheng signaled with his eyes to Liu Hong, who stood up. Everyone sat down eagerly, looking at him.
0:17:52|0:18:0|Liu Hong sat down angrily with a wave of his sleeve, and everyone fell silent, lowering their heads and returning to their seats. The atmosphere became heavy and tense for a moment.
0:18:22|0:18:33|Peng Liang glanced at everyone and slowly stood up.
0:18:33|0:18:49|Liu Hong looked up, as Li Zhengang was about to speak, the lookout suddenly entered the room. Everyone hurriedly stood up, [Lu Han] was about to rush out with a pistol, but [Wang Qiang] promptly stopped him and took the gun from his hand.
0:18:51|0:18:56|Outside on the village road, Gangcun led a team of Japanese soldiers on patrol.
0:18:56|0:19:9|In the reconnaissance battle, [Lu Han] hid the gun in the coal pile, covered it with a shovel, and then picked up the nearby lute to play.
0:19:9|0:19:17|It turned out that Li Zheng disguised himself as Mr. Guan Shi, while the others pretended to be workers collecting their wages. At this moment, the Japanese soldiers entered the courtyard.
0:19:33|0:19:40|The Japanese soldiers kicked open the door and burst in.
0:19:40|0:19:47|Gangcun looked around the room arrogantly, gesturing for the Japanese soldiers to enter, and frowned as he checked each person for signs of being a good citizen.
0:19:49|0:19:54|The Japanese soldiers also joined him in the inspection.
0:19:54|0:20:3|At this moment, the newly arrived wolf dog was vigorously digging in the coal pile where [Xiao Po] had hidden the gun.
0:20:3|0:20:5|At this moment, the wolf dog encountered a shovel.
0:20:14|0:20:18|[Lu Han] was puzzled, while [Wang Qiang] quietly picked up the shovel.
0:20:18|0:20:23|[Lu Han] walked to the coal pile, and everyone's hearts suddenly tightened.
0:20:23|0:20:26|The wolf dog picked up the coal shovel on the coal pile.
0:20:26|0:20:38|[Lu Han] looked around suspiciously, found nothing, threw the clay pipa on the ground, and left angrily.
0:20:38|0:20:41|[Wang Qiang] pretended to respectfully escort them out of the courtyard.
0:20:46|0:20:54|After the Japanese soldiers left, Lu Han quickly picked up the pipa and found that the strings were broken. He cursed angrily under his breath.
0:20:54|0:20:57|Li Zheng continued with his previous thoughts.
0:21:15|0:21:16|Liu Hong thought carefully, furrowing his brow.
0:21:16|0:21:16|In the evening, [Lu Han] returned to the command post.
0:21:16|0:21:20|The spy took out a group photo, showing guerrilla fighters in it.
0:21:50|0:22:13|In the deep night at the entrance of Zaozhuang Village, the motorcycle team from Gang Village came aggressively, their headlights cutting through the darkness. The Japanese troops surrounded [Lu Han] and the guerrilla fighters, aiming to capture them all.
0:22:13|0:22:14|They rushed into the courtyard of [Tan Zhan].
0:22:17|0:22:23|The charcoal stove burned brightly, illuminating the room.
0:22:23|0:22:34|No one responded, [Peng Liang] led the Japanese machine gunner to continuously shoot into the brightly lit room.
0:22:34|0:22:42|The guerrilla fighters walked on the mountain road, they had already left.
0:22:46|0:22:49|Li Zheng smiled and patted [Lu Han] on the shoulder.
0:23:31|0:23:36|A train is speeding past in the distance.
0:23:36|0:23:42|The scene shifts, and the guerrilla fighters arrive at the home of the underground party member [Fang Lin Sao] in Miaozhuang.
0:24:2|0:24:21|They sat down at the table, [Lu Han] holding [Fang Lin Sao]'s daughter Feng'er walked in, saying she was going to fetch water, [Lu Han] held Feng'er and sat with her by the door, teaching her to play the lute. The others at the table started talking, and I had this idea.
0:24:46|0:24:47|[Fang Lin Sao] lifted the water kettle.
0:25:18|0:25:20|Everyone exchanged glances and thought it was feasible.
0:25:51|0:25:58|At night, at the entrance of Zaozhuang Railway Station, people were coming and going, passengers were lining up with their luggage for ticket inspection.
0:25:58|0:26:8|The guerrilla fighters disguised themselves as merchants and pretended to be passengers, boarding the train through the ticket checkpoint.
0:26:8|0:26:13|On the moving train, [Wang Qiang] entered a compartment with a bottle of wine and a roasted chicken in hand.
0:26:17|0:26:26|He walked up to a Japanese officer lying on a chair, took off his hat, and nodded and bowed.
0:26:26|0:26:39|The Japanese officer glanced at him, [Wang Qiang] sat down opposite the Japanese officer, placed the bottle of wine and roast chicken on the table. The Japanese officer leaned back, [Wang Qiang] tried to offer him a cigarette, but was rejected by the Japanese officer.
0:26:56|0:27:3|[Wang Qiang] handed over the cigarette again, the Japanese officer took it. At the door of the carriage, [Lu Han] disguised himself and was ready to take action at any time.
0:27:3|0:27:8|[Wang Qiang] secretly lifted his leg and kicked it towards the Japanese officer.
0:27:8|0:27:11|The Japanese officer hesitated for a moment, then took it and started eating heartily.
0:27:13|0:27:17|[Wang Qiang] poured him a drink and kicked it in front of him.
0:27:17|0:27:26|In another train compartment, a guerrilla fighter obsequiously offers wine and buns to a Japanese soldier.
0:27:28|0:27:33|The passengers nearby whispered to each other as the train continued to speed through the night.
0:27:33|0:27:38|In the train carriage, guerrilla fighter [Xiao Po] started playing the lute, and the Japanese officer listened with interest.
0:27:46|0:27:57|Meanwhile, [Liu Hong] and [Peng Liang] were already ambushed on the side of the railway.
0:27:57|0:28:2|After speaking, [Lu Han] quickly ran through the freezing cold under the railway and reached the other side of the tracks.
0:28:2|0:28:6|[Peng Liang] also rushed out of the bushes, leaped lightly, and climbed onto the moving train's locomotive.
0:28:8|0:28:14|He looked up at the connection between the carriages and saw [Liu Hong] climbing up on the other side of the train head.
0:28:14|0:28:19|[Liu Hong] pulled out a gun and shot dead the Japanese driver.
0:28:19|0:28:22|The two climbed into the carriage and rushed into the driver's cabin.
0:28:22|0:28:29|[Wang Qiang] quickly took his seat and skillfully operated the train, which immediately accelerated and raced forward.
0:28:36|0:28:49|Liu Hong nodded, and as soon as the driver got in, he happily picked up a shovel and energetically shoveled coal into the train furnace, and the train started rushing along the tracks.
0:28:49|0:28:57|In the other compartment, the guerrillas were playing tricks on the Japanese soldiers, playing the pipa, and pouring cup after cup of wine.
0:28:57|0:29:1|The Japanese officer greedily chewed on the food handed to him by the guerrilla, completely letting his guard down.
0:29:4|0:29:9|The train is getting faster and faster, and the pipa is being played more urgently.
0:29:9|0:29:23|The guerrilla fighter, Lu Han, who was secretly observing, was ready to act, as the train continued to move forward, approaching the platform of Wang Qiang Railway Station.
0:29:23|0:29:30|[Wang Qiang] drove the train through the platform without hesitation, and the station master at Wanggou Station quickly called Gao Xiong to report the situation.
0:29:41|0:29:49|On a hillside along the railway track, Li Zheng has already set up with the guerrilla team, ready to ambush the train.
0:29:49|0:29:54|Outside the train carriage, [Lu Han] is seen standing on the outside of the front of the train, holding onto the side with one hand against the wind.
0:29:54|0:29:59|Seeing that the train was about to reach the hill, he raised his pistol towards the sky and signaled.
0:30:6|0:30:19|Upon hearing the gunshots, Peng Liang pulled the lever and initiated emergency braking on the train. The train began to slow down, and inside the carriage, Lu Han and the other operatives looked serious, ready for battle.
0:30:19|0:30:24|[Wang Qiang] took the opportunity to smash a wine bottle on the head of the Japanese officer across from him who was looking out of the car window.
0:30:25|0:30:33|Other guerrilla fighters also joined in, some pulling out pistols, some grabbing bottles, and some fighting the Japanese soldiers bare-handed.
0:30:33|0:30:38|Passengers were startled and all got up to flee, causing chaos inside the carriage.
0:30:38|0:30:44|A guerrilla fighter and a Japanese soldier were wrestling, and he grabbed an egg from the side and smashed it on the face of the Japanese soldier.
0:30:44|0:30:49|[Xiao Po] then pulled down the window of the train and forcefully wedged the head of the Japanese officer who was looking out of the window.
0:30:50|0:30:57|The Japanese soldier kept struggling, and Lu Han fiercely smashed him with the super earth lute, even shattering the window glass.
0:30:57|0:31:4|Seeing that the Japanese soldiers were still struggling, [Wang Qiang] pulled out his pistol and walked over.
0:31:4|0:31:8|[Wang Qiang] shot and killed the trapped Japanese officer.
0:31:8|0:31:13|The train slowly came to a stop on a cold bridge along the railway amidst the sound of gunshots.
0:31:13|0:31:19|At the same time, the Japanese soldiers Kobayashi and Gangcun led the Japanese troops to board the armored train, chasing after the robbed train.
0:31:21|0:31:25|At this moment, the passengers gathered under the cold bridge where [Li Zheng] shouted loudly.
0:31:47|0:31:55|The guerrillas pasted slogans such as "Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation" on the outside of the train carriage, and threw a straw hat with the word "Ba Luo" written on it next to the train.
0:31:59|0:32:5|Passengers quickly dispersed and moved under the cover of the guerrillas.
0:32:5|0:32:11|The Japanese armored train kept firing shells from a distance while advancing towards the train.
0:32:11|0:32:14|But due to the railway being destroyed by the guerrillas, the armored vehicle had to come to a stop.
0:32:17|0:32:19|The Japanese soldier [Kobayashi] observed the situation.
0:32:22|0:32:30|The shooting from the armored train became more intense, with shells falling one after another beside the railway tracks, and the black smoke from the explosions kept rising.
0:32:30|0:32:37|After the bombardment, [Lu Han] and [Wang Qiang] led the team to the hijacked train, only to find it empty with no one inside.
0:32:46|0:32:50|[Xiao Lin] said nothing, but lowered his head and saw the straw hat.
0:32:50|0:32:55|He picked up a straw hat, on which were written the words "Eighth Route".
0:33:18|0:33:32|Jiangcun is leading his subordinates to inspect the train carriages, while the postal team members are transferring.
0:33:32|0:33:36|[Xiao Po] put on the Japanese soldier's hat, carried the confiscated ammunition, and started singing happily.
0:33:56|0:34:13|After Liu Hong finished speaking, he left to scout ahead. The other team members scattered to rest. [Peng Liang] sat down leaning against his gun, and [Wang Qiang] stood by his side, dusting off the dirt on his clothes. [Peng Liang] took out a cigarette and handed it to [Wang Qiang].
0:34:30|0:34:37|At this moment, ahead, Liu Hong climbed the hill with [Xiao Po].
0:34:37|0:34:52|They gazed out at the vast Weishan Lake, where the water rippled gently and the distant mountains surrounded the area, creating a peaceful and serene scene.
0:34:52|0:34:55|Seeing such a view, [Lu Han] couldn't help but smile and sigh.
0:34:59|0:35:10|However, next to a large rock on the hillside, several Kuomintang bandits cautiously peeked out, spotting Liu Hong and [Xiao Po] on the hill.
0:35:10|0:35:20|A Kuomintang officer saw the two men through a telescope and signaled for his troops to open fire.
0:35:20|0:35:21|Liu Hong's right arm was shot.
0:35:24|0:35:28|Liu Hong fired a pistol with his left hand, returning fire with [Xiao Po].
0:35:28|0:35:39|Nationalist army officers commanded a large number of troops to launch an attack on the hillside, the sound of gunfire alarmed the guerrilla fighters resting below the hill, directing them forward.
0:35:39|0:35:43|The guerrilla fighters pulled out their pistols and launched attacks in two directions.
0:35:43|0:35:46|On the hillside, [Liu Hong] fell into a coma due to excessive blood loss.
0:35:47|0:35:54|[Xiao Po] carried [Liu Hong] on his back and ran quickly towards the village in the seedlings on the hillside, arriving at the gate of [Fang Lin Sao]'s courtyard.
0:36:5|0:36:11|[Fang Lin Sao] opened the gate of the courtyard and was shocked to see [Xiao Po] carrying the unconscious [Liu Hong].
0:36:11|0:36:16|[Xiao Po] walked into the courtyard with her, and [Fang Lin Sao] quickly closed the courtyard gate.
0:36:16|0:36:19|[Xiao Po] placed [Liu Hong] on the kang and helped her sit down.
0:36:19|0:36:28|[Fang Lin Sao] quickly took out a piece of white cloth, tore off a strip, and used it to bandage the head injury of [Lu Hong].
0:36:28|0:36:34|At this moment, outside the courtyard, officers of the Nationalist Army led their troops in pursuit, running past the doorstep of [Fang Lin Sao]'s house.
0:36:36|0:36:52|On the other side, the guerrillas rushed into the village, took out their pistols, and engaged in a firefight with the Nationalist Army, driving them back.
0:36:52|0:36:59|In Fang Lin Sao's house, Liu Hong lay weakly on the kang with her eyes closed, her head wrapped in white cloth.
0:36:59|0:37:3|[Fang Lin Sao] sat by the kang, holding a bowl of soup and feeding [Liu Hong] spoon by spoon.
0:37:6|0:37:19|[Liu Hong] drank the soup, opened his eyes and looked at her affectionately, while [Fang Lin Sao] also gazed warmly at [Liu Hong], and the two remained silent.
0:37:19|0:37:28|At this moment, [Li Zheng], [Wang Qiang], and several other team members walked in. [Fang Lin Sao] nodded in acknowledgment and walked out with a bowl in her hands.
0:37:28|0:37:29|[Liu Hong] struggled to sit up.
0:37:32|0:37:39|Supporting [Lu Han] to lie down, the others looked at him with concern. [Lu Han] trembled slightly as he spoke excitedly.
0:37:44|0:37:50|Liu Hong's head tilted towards the militia, his brows furrowed, and he said angrily,
0:37:57|0:37:59|Liu Hong unwillingly slammed his fist on the bed board.
0:38:9|0:38:14|[Liu Hong] nodded, but still had a worried look on his face, taking a deep breath.
0:38:14|0:38:18|[Lu Han] comforts her at the bedside.
0:38:18|0:38:28|In the office of the special operations team at Zaozhuang Railway Station, [Lu Han] was smoking and walked to the desk, picking up the erhu found in the carriage. A special agent approached.
0:38:59|0:39:4|The village fell into contemplation.
0:39:4|0:39:16|At night, in the house of Fang Lin Sao in Miao Village, the candle flickered on the table. Liu Hong, who was still recovering from his injuries, sat in front of the brazier holding the already asleep Feng'er.
0:39:16|0:39:22|She gently placed Feng'er on the bed and covered her with a blanket.
0:39:22|0:39:37|At this moment, [Fang Lin Sao] walked in with a bowl of chicken soup. She looked pleased as she placed the soup on the table, then walked over to Liu Hong's side. The two exchanged smiles.
0:39:37|0:39:44|After speaking, [Fang Lin Sao] picked up the medical kit from the table, sat down in front of the basin, and added a few pieces of charcoal to the basin.
0:39:44|0:39:51|Liu Hong also got up from the bedside, took off the bandage on his arm, and sat down across from [Fang Lin Sao].
0:39:51|0:39:53|[Fang Lin Sao] carefully removes the gauze and changes the medicine.
0:39:56|0:39:59|After taking the medicine, she wrapped herself in new bandages again.
0:39:59|0:40:13|During the medication change, Liu Hong always secretly glanced at [Fang Lin Sao], who also looked back at her from time to time.
0:40:20|0:40:29|Liu Hong spoke, picking up the rifle placed on the table with his right hand, aiming steadily at the imaginary enemy, while [Fang Lin Sao] looked at him affectionately.
0:40:32|0:40:37|The next morning, Li Zheng and a team of players arrived at [Fang Lin Sao]'s house for a meeting.
0:40:37|0:40:39|[Fang Lin Sao] cooked for them.
0:40:39|0:40:46|Several people sat down at the table, and [Fang Lin Sao] went to the stove, took out some roasted sweet potatoes from inside, wrapped them in her apron, and stood up.
0:40:46|0:40:50|[Fang Lin Sao] smiled in front of the stove and took one from her apron.
0:40:50|0:40:52|[Fang Lin Sao] walked to the table.
0:41:13|0:41:16|[Fang Lin Sao] put on her clothes and went out as she spoke.
0:41:16|0:41:19|Liu Hong smiled shyly.
0:41:19|0:41:23|Outside the house, [Fang Lin Sao] was watching at the village entrance under a big tree.
0:41:23|0:41:28|At this moment, three suspicious-looking individuals were seen walking towards the village.
0:41:28|0:41:30|[Fang Lin Sao] cautiously hid behind a big tree, observing carefully.
0:41:32|0:41:50|Two of them were pushing a small cart, with a person sitting on it. They stopped at the village entrance, and the person on the cart got off with a cane in hand. [Fang Lin Sao] noticed something was wrong, as the person looked around sneakily while walking. It turned out he was a Japanese soldier who had just entered the village.
0:41:52|0:41:55|[Fang Lin Sao] quietly retreated and ran back home.
0:41:55|0:42:1|Gangcun noticed it, she pulled out her gun and signaled a large group of plainclothes agents hiding behind her to chase after them together.
0:42:1|0:42:8|The gunshots at the village entrance startled the guerrilla fighters who were having a meeting.
0:42:8|0:42:11|[Fang Lin Sao] arrived in time, Liu Hong ran a few steps, then turned back.
0:42:19|0:42:31|Fang Lin Sao jumped over the wall into her own yard, but as soon as she landed, she saw the Japanese soldiers had already arrived outside the yard. She had to hide by the wall.
0:42:31|0:42:37|On the other side, Liu Hong, Li Zheng, and [Wang Qiang] successively leaped over the courtyard wall, swiftly moving, while [Xiao Po] carried Feng'er on his back.
0:42:38|0:42:54|Arriving at the courtyard of an old lady, leaving the phoenix with her and then jumping over the wall to leave, Jiangcun led the undercover Japanese soldiers into the home of [Fang Lin Sao]. They searched roughly everywhere, smashing tables and cabinets to the ground, but found nothing.
0:42:54|0:43:1|They caused chaos in the courtyard, shooting randomly. Liu Hong, Li Zheng, [Wang Qiang], and [Xiao Po] climbed over the earthen wall to the village entrance.
0:43:12|0:43:16|On the other side, [Fang Lin Sao] is still hiding from the Japanese soldiers in the village.
0:43:16|0:43:22|She hid behind the wall and saw a large group of Japanese soldiers rushing into the village.
0:43:22|0:43:26|They met with an undercover agent hiding behind a big tree.
0:43:31|0:43:35|They were getting ready to take action when suddenly, gunshots rang out.
0:43:35|0:43:38|It turned out that it was Lu Han and Wang Qiang who led the guerrillas to escape back.
0:43:39|0:43:46|The undercover Japanese soldiers fled in all directions, while the guerrilla fighters threw grenades and charged forward with their guns.
0:43:46|0:43:53|[Gangcun] and other Japanese soldiers rushed out of the house in a panic. Just as he was about to escape, he realized that the courtyard had already been surrounded.
0:43:53|0:43:57|[Liu Hong] led the guerrillas into the courtyard and eliminated the Japanese undercover agents.
0:43:57|0:44:3|Only [Gangcun] jumped over the wall and escaped from the yard, running towards the village outside regardless of everything.
0:44:3|0:44:5|[Liu Hong] keeps shooting while relentlessly pursuing.
0:44:8|0:44:13|When Lu Han ran to the big tree outside the village, he happened to run into Fang Lin Sao hiding behind the tree.
0:44:16|0:44:23|[Fang Lin Sao] flew over and wrestled with [Gang Cun], grabbing her clothes and fiercely smashing a hand grenade towards her head.
0:44:23|0:44:24|[Gangcun] broke free from his clothes and ran away.
0:44:26|0:44:34|[Fang Lin Sao] heard the sound and threw the grenade, but it only hit [Gang Cun] and did not explode, rolling to the ground.
0:44:34|0:44:37|Lei Hong hurriedly took the gun and fired, only to find that there were no bullets left.
0:44:40|0:44:43|Jiangcun ran farther and farther, already escaping.
0:44:43|0:44:47|Watching Jiang Cun escape, Liu Hong regretfully stomped her foot.
0:44:47|0:44:53|Later, she picked up an unexploded hand grenade from the ground.
0:44:55|0:45:0|[Fang Lin Sao] was about to pull the string with her right hand, but was stopped by Liu Hong.
0:45:0|0:45:7|[Fang Lin Sao] was also deeply regretful of her mistake. She stomped her foot in regret and angrily threw the outer garment of Jiangcun on the ground.
0:45:11|0:45:28|At night, the Japanese cavalry rode into the Miao Village, setting fires recklessly. [Gangcun] had bandages wrapped around his head, commanding the troops. The Japanese soldiers retaliated wildly, plunging the village into a sea of flames.
0:45:28|0:45:35|After daybreak, [Lu Han] led the team to the burned Miao village, where remnants of black smoke were still rising.
0:45:39|0:45:50|The homeless villagers sat by the roadside, looking solemn, while children cried and wailed.
0:45:50|0:45:57|The guerrilla fighters watched all this with heavy expressions, and [Lu Han] said indignantly.
0:46:9|0:46:18|On a small hill by the lake, the guerrilla team engaged in a battle of attrition with the Japanese invaders.
0:46:18|0:46:24|The Japanese troops waved the flag of Japan, launching wave after wave of frenzied attacks.
0:46:24|0:46:26|A row of guerrilla fighters fired machine guns fiercely.
0:46:36|0:46:43|[Wang Qiang] tried to persuade [Liu Hong] without success, so he went to [Xiao Po]'s side.
0:46:43|0:46:48|[Wang Qiang] stomped his feet anxiously as [Xiao Po] walked away with a gun.
0:46:50|0:46:59|[Liu Hong] burst into tears, and the guerrilla team's shooting became more intense. Grenades exploded one after another, smoke billowed, and a large number of Japanese soldiers fell in front of the high ground.
0:46:59|0:47:4|[Lu Han] laughed excitedly and took out a bottle of wine to gulp down.
0:47:4|0:47:7|In the bushes, a Japanese soldier fired at him, knocking down the wine bottle.
0:47:7|0:47:12|[Lu Han] angrily threw away the bottle, jumped out of the trench, and shot dead the Japanese soldier who was shooting at him with a pistol.
0:47:13|0:47:27|Picking up the machine gun from the Japanese soldier's hands, he prepared to shoot, but another Japanese soldier shot him. [Lu Han] held the machine gun and started shooting at the Japanese soldiers, but suddenly he was shot in the head.
0:47:27|0:47:33|[Wang Qiang] grabbed Xiaobo and threw a grenade at the Japanese soldiers, while others pulled [Lu Han] back into the trench.
0:47:38|0:47:46|The Japanese officer raised his sword high and commanded the Japanese soldiers to charge towards the guerrilla position.
0:47:46|0:47:49|Liu Hong picked up the machine gun and fought back with the guerrilla fighters.
0:47:49|0:47:52|At this moment, Li Zheng returned by boat.
0:47:52|0:47:55|Li Zheng quickly ran to Liu Hong's side.
0:47:58|0:48:4|The Japanese troops kept charging forward continuously, while a large number of monk troops also kept pouring towards the guerrilla team's position.
0:48:4|0:48:6|The guerrilla team is about to be surrounded.
0:48:18|0:48:26|Liu Hong said that they needed to continue shooting at the Japanese with machine guns, and a large number of Japanese soldiers fell in front of the position.
0:48:26|0:48:36|Under Liu Hong's command, the guerrilla fighters quickly retreated from the high ground. Just as they left their positions, the enemy started shelling, with explosions covering the previous battlefield in an instant.
0:49:13|0:49:25|Li Zheng, lying injured on the kang, woke up. Liu Hong hurriedly walked to Li Zheng's side.
0:49:25|0:49:28|[Lu Han] reached out from under the blanket, took out a pack of cigarettes, and handed it to [Liu Hong].
0:50:13|0:50:29|Liu Hong, with tears in her eyes, held [Li Zheng]'s hands tightly. The scene shifted to the lakeside of Weishan Lake, where Liu Hong embraced [Li Zheng] who was lying on a stretcher. The guerrilla fighters all gathered by the lake, bidding farewell to [Li Zheng] with reluctance.
0:50:51|0:51:0|At this moment, [Fang Lin Sao] arrived at the stretcher of [Li Zheng].
0:51:3|0:51:19|Later, the team members lifted him onto the small boat parked by the lake. The guerrillas watched as the small boat left, only to see it drift further and further away on the calm Weishan Lake. Liu Hong watched the small boat, tears streaming down his face.
0:51:19|0:51:28|In 1941, as the Pacific War broke out, in the meeting room of the Japanese commander Koba, the Japanese senior officers were waiting for Koba. When [Peng Liang] walked in with Koba.
0:51:30|0:51:32|The Japanese soldiers quickly stood at attention.
0:51:32|0:51:33|Fang Lin Sao opens the map on the table.
0:51:59|0:52:6|In the mountains around the lake, guerrilla fighters ride on horse-drawn carts instead of trains, conducting shooting training while on the move.
0:52:6|0:52:9|The bullet hit the target gourd, but no more shots were fired.
0:52:9|0:52:12|At this moment, [Lu Han] arrived at the training ground.
0:52:27|0:52:39|The scene shifts, [Fang Lin Sao] puts on a pair of embroidered shoes at home, then she carefully does her makeup in front of the mirror.
0:52:40|0:52:40|Lu Han, dressed as a groom, turned around and looked at Fang Lin Sao with a smile, saying.
0:52:55|0:53:11|In the bustling market, [Fang Lin Sao] sat on a donkey with a bundle, while [Wang Qiang] led the donkey. They passed through the market and arrived at a street corner. [Fang Lin Sao] jumped off the donkey, while [Wang Qiang] tied the donkey and explained something to [Fang Lin Sao].
0:53:17|0:53:20|[Fang Lin Sao] finished speaking and then walked into the street with the package.
0:53:21|0:53:26|[Liu Qiang] then met up with [Peng Liang] and they walked together in the opposite direction towards another street.
0:53:26|0:53:35|[Lu Han] and the other three team members met up and walked into a small restaurant on the street.
0:53:35|0:53:39|Several people walked into a private room and sat down at the dining table.
0:53:39|0:53:45|At this moment, the voices of the customers discussing could be heard from the outdoor dining table.
0:53:59|0:54:18|Liu Hong asked the waiter, who then left after answering. Liu Hong smoked and pondered for a moment, then stood up and lowered the curtain of the private room.
0:54:23|0:54:24|They started changing clothes.
0:54:24|0:54:32|On the other side, [Fang Lin Sao] is arranging the task.
0:54:32|0:54:35|And the guests in the restaurant were still discussing.
0:54:46|0:54:47|A guest gives a thumbs-up.
0:55:1|0:55:6|At this moment, the waiter walked past the diners with a tray in hand.
0:55:6|0:55:9|As soon as he entered the private room, he found it empty with no one in sight.
0:55:9|0:55:13|Looking out the window, there were only the distant figures of four Japanese soldiers retreating.
0:55:13|0:55:23|He put down the tray and found a stack of banknotes under the teacup on the dining table.
0:55:23|0:55:28|On the platform of Lincheng train station, a large number of Japanese officers are boarding the train, preparing to head to the battlefield.
0:55:31|0:55:47|Against the backdrop of military music, Japanese expatriates cheered loudly, holding banners and flags in celebration. Among the lively crowd, guerrilla fighters disguised as Japanese officers also arrived at the train station, ready to seize the opportunity to take control of the Japanese military band.
0:55:47|0:55:50|Liu Hong and other team members arrived at the military train where the Japanese were boarding along the railway.
0:55:53|0:56:1|Yidao killed the Japanese sentry, Liu Hong and [Peng Liang] quickly climbed onto the front of the military train, subdued the Japanese driver with a pistol, and [Wang Qiang] sat in the driver's seat.
0:56:5|0:56:11|At this moment, the undercover agent at the station holding the signal lamp waved the green light three times to the military train.
0:56:11|0:56:16|After receiving the signal in the locomotive, Liu Hong signaled to [Xiao Po] under the military train head.
0:56:16|0:56:21|[Xiao Po] received a signal, blew a whistle, and [Lu Han] changed the original driving route.
0:56:21|0:56:26|The military train started, full of ammunition and Japanese soldiers, it left the Lincheng train station with full horsepower.
0:56:29|0:56:34|Lu Han on the platform urgently waved the signal lamp in his hand, trying to get the military train to stop.
0:56:34|0:56:40|Japanese soldiers on the platform raised their guns in warning.
0:56:40|0:56:43|The Japanese army column is pressing on the railway.
0:56:43|0:56:49|At this moment, a Japanese officer led a group of Japanese soldiers, charging towards the front of the train from the top.
0:56:49|0:56:53|Liu Hong and [Xiao Po] lay on the hood with guns in hand, watching the movements of the Japanese soldiers.
0:56:53|0:56:57|Liu Hong turned around and walked towards the front of the car, shoveling coal into the stove vigorously.
0:57:4|0:57:15|At this moment, a Japanese train came towards them. [Wang Qiang] accelerated and drove towards the oncoming Japanese train, then jumped off the train with other team members.
0:57:15|0:57:19|In the wailing of the Japanese soldiers, two trains collided and exploded.
0:57:25|0:57:36|Later, Lu Han and Fang Lin Sao, upon learning about the train collision, were terrified.
0:57:36|0:57:41|After this incident, there were multiple consecutive events of Japanese military trains derailing and railway bridges being bombed.
0:57:45|0:57:52|The scene shifts to the conference room in the headquarters, where [Fang Lin Sao] angrily gives [Lu Han] a hard slap across the face.
0:57:52|0:57:58|Other Japanese generals sat silently at the conference table.
0:58:16|0:58:20|Soon after, a large number of Japanese hunting teams arrived at Lake Weishan.
0:58:20|0:58:37|They carried magnetic knives, brought supplies, and drove small boats to start besieging the guerrilla team on Weishan Island.
0:58:37|0:58:40|At night, [Fang Lin Sao] rowed a small boat towards Weishan Island.
0:58:42|0:58:50|On Weishan Island, Lu Han, Wang Qiang, and Fang Lin Sao stand by the reeds at the lake, observing the situation of the Japanese soldiers on the opposite shore.
0:58:50|0:58:57|On the other side of the lake, a train roared past on the railway, with occasional flares of the enemy's signal rising by the lakeside.
0:58:57|0:59:2|[Fang Lin Sao] arrived at Weishan Island, tied up the small boat, and ran towards [Liu Hong] and the others.
0:59:49|0:59:51|[Liu Hong] pondered for a moment.
0:59:53|0:59:59|At night, a Japanese liaison officer arrived at the command post of the Nationalist Party.
0:59:59|1:0:2|He handed a letter to the Nationalist Army officer.
1:0:3|1:0:5|The Japanese liaison officer [Lu Han] nodded.
1:0:7|1:0:13|The next day, the Japanese artillery began a fierce bombardment on the guerrilla base on Weishan Island.
1:0:13|1:0:19|At the same time, under the cover of the cannon, the Japanese soldiers began to attack Weishan Island by boat.
1:0:22|1:0:43|The guerrillas, led by [Liu Hong], fired machine guns at the enemy on the steamboat. They threw grenades at the enemy's steamboat, causing some of them to fall into the water. Some of the enemies started to land, and with a shout from [Liu Hong], the guerrillas threw grenades one after another, causing explosions.
1:0:43|1:0:56|The invading Japanese soldiers who landed were blown to the ground, but soon another wave of Japanese soldiers rushed up. The Japanese soldiers on the steamboat drew their swords and fought fiercely, firing at each other, bombing the trenches, and the battle became more intense.
1:0:56|1:1:1|The smoke cleared, and Liu Hong critically checked on the situation of [Xiao Po] beside him.
1:1:5|1:1:9|At this moment, the once peaceful and tranquil Weishan Island is now shrouded in thick smoke.
1:1:20|1:1:31|In the evening, at the Duck Village to the east of Lake Weishan, the Japanese invaders have taken control of the area, setting up checkpoints and conducting thorough searches.
1:1:31|1:1:36|[Fang Lin Sao] is trapped here and unable to return to Weishan Island.
1:1:36|1:1:43|The scene shifts to Weishan Island, where the setting sun casts a shimmering light on Weishan Lake amidst the trembling gaps.
1:1:44|1:1:50|[Xiao Po] took out his clay pipa, blew off the dust on it, and began to tune the strings.
1:1:50|1:1:55|In the guerrilla base, Lu Han and [Wang Qiang] were smoking and chatting.
1:2:58|1:3:3|In the singing, some soldiers hum along, while others polish their guns.
1:3:33|1:3:39|In the early morning, guerrilla fighter Peng Liang rowed a small boat to the island for reconnaissance.
1:3:39|1:3:40|At this moment, Peng Liang returned.
1:3:40|1:3:41|[Lu Han] looks serious.
1:3:59|1:4:5|[Lu Han] jumped down with a gun in hand.
1:4:5|1:4:16|[Wang Qiang] and the team all gathered around [Lu Han]. [Lu Han] was infected by their emotions, he suddenly pulled out his pistol, ready to give the order to fight the Japanese soldiers, but then he suddenly calmed down.
1:4:34|1:4:40|The guerrilla fighters all walked towards the village, when [Wang Qiang] turned around and approached Lu Han.
1:4:46|1:4:56|The scene shifts to guerrilla fighters disguised as Japanese invaders marching in formation along a mountain road on Weishan Island, with Lu Han and [Wang Qiang] leading the way disguised as Japanese officers.
1:4:58|1:5:4|Several guerrilla fighters carrying machine guns quickly shouldered their guns, ready for battle.
1:5:4|1:5:10|At this moment, in the headquarters of the Japanese besieging force, [Lu Han] arrived at Kobayashi's desk.
1:5:15|1:5:16|Xiao Lin finished reading the battle report.
1:5:16|1:5:18|On Weishan Island, a group of Japanese soldiers is searching along the mountain path.
1:5:18|1:5:19|At the same time, the guerrilla fighters discovered these enemies.
1:5:49|1:5:53|The guerrilla fighters quickly spread out, ready for battle.
1:5:53|1:5:59|[Wang Qiang] spoke in a strange language to the Japanese soldiers. The Japanese officer, seeing [Wang Qiang]'s strange language through his binoculars, thought he was their own people, so he led the troops to leave.
1:5:59|1:6:1|Liu Hong inserted the pistol and led the team in the opposite direction to search for the Japanese soldiers.
1:6:12|1:6:34|In the evening, Lu Han led the team from the Great Wall to the edge of the reed marsh by Lake Weishan, and began to wade across the lake on foot.
1:6:34|1:6:41|At night, [Fang Lin Sao]'s whereabouts were discovered by undercover agents, who led the Japanese soldiers to start searching for her.
1:6:45|1:6:50|The Japanese soldiers dispersed with torches and began searching the area.
1:6:50|1:6:54|[Fang Lin Sao] carried a basket, shuttling through the reeds, hidden from view.
1:6:54|1:7:1|He took out a grenade and threw it at the Japanese soldiers, then observed the front.
1:7:1|1:7:5|However, a Japanese soldier quietly sneaked up behind him, ready to strike at any moment.
1:7:10|1:7:17|At night, [Lu Han] led a group of Japanese soldiers on a small boat, searching along the reed marshes on the shore of Lake Weishan.
1:7:17|1:7:25|At this moment, the guerrilla team waded through the water and arrived at the side of the reed marsh, where they ran into the Japanese soldiers led by [Gangcun].
1:7:25|1:7:31|[Liu Hong] led the team to confront the Japanese soldiers.
1:7:45|1:7:54|Gangcun did not answer, turned on the flashlight, and [Liu Hong] also took out a flashlight, revealing their identities on both sides.
1:7:54|1:7:58|As soon as the words fell, the team members opened fire, catching the devils off guard and causing chaos.
1:8:0|1:8:5|The Japanese soldiers fell into the water one after another, with [Lu Han] flipping under the boat and holding onto the side of the boat.
1:8:5|1:8:10|In the melee, guerrilla fighters opened fire, and [Lu Han] fell into the water after being hit by a bullet.
1:8:10|1:8:27|The guerrillas threw grenades, blowing up the Japanese soldiers' small boat, causing the Japanese flag to fall into the water.
1:8:27|1:8:29|In 1945, the Japanese invaders announced their surrender.
1:8:38|1:8:51|The news of Japan's unconditional surrender spread, and the villagers joyfully spread the word. In the mountains where the guerrilla team was stationed, Fang Lin Sao's daughter Feng Er was happily picking wildflowers on the hillside when Lu Han arrived.
1:9:5|1:9:14|Feng'er ran into the arms of [Lu Han] holding flowers.
1:9:25|1:9:38|Wearing the uniform of the Eighth Route Army, [Li Zheng] rode a horse to the guerrilla base. He waved to the team members in greeting, and they all clapped and surrounded him. [Li Zheng] dismounted and approached [Liu Hong], and they embraced tightly.
1:9:57|1:10:1|Feng'er handed the wild flowers to [Li Zheng], who happily picked up Feng'er and kissed her.
1:10:10|1:10:17|[Liu Hong] and [Li Zheng] rode on warhorses, leading the guerrilla team members, and began to advance towards the railway side near Lincity.
1:10:17|1:10:20|The guerrilla team set out on their march in high spirits.
1:10:25|1:10:42|At this moment, Colonel Lu Han is leading his troops, riding on horseback, swaggering towards Linqing City.
1:10:42|1:10:49|On the other side, the Nationalist Army took over the prisoners from the Japanese devils' prison in Lincity, and [Fang Lin Sao] was among them.
1:11:14|1:11:18|At the same time, the guerrilla team completed the combat deployment.
1:11:18|1:11:27|On the mountain road, [Fang Lin Sao] and other anti-Japanese warriors were tied up by the Nationalist Army and escorted to the Lincheng train station.
1:11:27|1:11:31|[Liu Hong], [Xiao Po], and [Liu Fei] are riding horses ahead.
1:11:31|1:11:36|Other guerrilla fighters followed closely behind, rushing towards the Nationalist Army.
1:11:47|1:11:49|[Liu Hong] rides a horse, galloping alongside the railway line.
1:11:49|1:11:57|At the same time, the Nationalist Army escorted [Fang Lin Sao] and others towards the mountain ditch, preparing for execution by firing squad.
1:11:57|1:12:1|[Liu Hong] and others galloped ahead, surpassing a speeding train.
1:12:1|1:12:4|In the mountain valley, the soldiers raised their guns, preparing for the execution.
1:12:23|1:12:26|The Nationalist soldiers holding guns fell one after another, it turned out that the guerrilla fighters arrived just in time.
1:12:51|1:13:7|In the distance, Lu Han, the Jap soldier Kobayashi at Lincheng train station, heard the intensive gunfire from afar and felt something was wrong. He ordered his troops to quickly board the train. The Jap soldiers swiftly got on the armored train. On the other side, Wang Qiang led his team to the route that the Jap train must pass through, but the Jap armored car had already passed by.
1:13:7|1:13:12|The guerrilla fighters fiercely shot at the incoming Japanese armored vehicle, but it had little effect.
1:13:14|1:13:18|[Wang Qiang] and [Peng Liang] stood up and led the Japanese armored vehicle charging forward.
1:13:18|1:13:26|Meanwhile, [Liu Hong] and [Li Zheng] are still leading the team in fierce battle.
