0:0:25|0:0:32|A winding path on the Loess Plateau.
0:0:32|0:0:42|Young [You Tianming] followed behind his father [You Bensheng], they were on their way to the home of the blacksmith [Jiao Sanye] to apprentice and learn skills. [You Tianming] pouted, looking reluctant.
0:0:42|0:0:48|The father picked up a small stone and threw it towards [You Tianming], who dodged it.
0:0:51|0:0:56|They continued walking as the villagers herded their sheep past them.
0:0:56|0:1:2|Standing at a high place, Jiao Sanye stopped to catch his breath, the scorching sun making him sweat profusely.
0:1:2|0:1:5|The father looked at the village by the Yellow River below and said,
0:1:10|0:1:16|The father placed the package he carried with him on the ground, took off his sun hat, wiped the sweat with his sleeve, and began to fan himself with the hat.
0:1:16|0:1:17|Father and son arrived at the home of [Jiao Sanye]. The father cautiously opened a door crack and peered inside.
0:1:39|0:1:44|Then he opened the door and led [You Tianming] inside.
0:1:44|0:1:50|[Nuonuo], the dog raised by Jiao Sanye, heard the noise and ran out. The father and son were startled and hid behind the wall.
0:1:52|0:2:0|[Jiao Sanye] took Nuonuo back into the room, while the father led [You Tianming] into the courtyard.
0:2:0|0:2:4|The father stood in the yard, looking straight at the house.
0:2:4|0:2:9|[Jiao Sanye] took his time before slowly walking out and sitting on the wooden bench in front of the house.
0:2:14|0:2:21|Father took out a cigarette from his pocket and ran towards [Jiao Sanye], but he didn't notice the steps on the ground and fell hard.
0:2:36|0:2:42|Father's head was injured, [You Tianming] tenderly covered the wound, a tear rolled down from the corner of his eye.
0:2:42|0:2:53|[Jiao Sanye] looked thoughtful at the scene, as his father got up and picked up the wet cigarette from the puddle.
0:2:53|0:2:58|[Jiao Sanye] pointed to the pipe in his hand, and father awkwardly exchanged glances with [You Tianming].
0:3:0|0:3:9|The cicadas chirped, the sun was high in the sky, the father and son, along with Jiao Sanye, all unconsciously looked up at the sun.
0:3:15|0:3:22|Youbensheng lit a pipe for [Jiao Sanye], who took two deep puffs.
0:3:28|0:3:34|At this moment, [Shiniang] walked out of the house carrying two bowls of water.
0:3:34|0:3:42|Father and son took the water and drank it in big gulps, finishing it in one go.
0:4:19|0:4:26|[Shiniang] placed a water ladle on the small wooden table in the courtyard and handed a small section of reed to You Tianming.
0:4:26|0:4:29|You Tianming's initiation test has begun.
0:4:33|0:4:40|You Tianming looked at his father with a troubled expression, and his father nodded, indicating him to follow through quickly.
0:4:40|0:4:46|You Tianming reluctantly walked up to the water gourd and began to suck water with all his might.
0:4:56|0:5:3|Young You Tianming couldn't drink up the water in the ladle, and the water in his mouth sprayed out, spilling onto the ground.
0:5:3|0:5:8|[Shiniang] looked at little Tianming with concern, while the father walked over to [Jiao Sanye] and pleaded.
0:5:24|0:5:30|[Jiao Sanye] still refused to accept You Tianming as his disciple. His father turned around and looked at Tianming lying on the ground, then started scolding.
0:5:47|0:5:55|[Jiao Sanye] remained unmoved, as his father continued to beat him with a water stick.
0:5:55|0:6:3|Suddenly, [Jiao Sanye] grabbed Father Yang's arm in mid-air, indicating that he had accepted [You Tianming].
0:6:3|0:6:11|Father walked out of Jiao Sanye's house, with You Tianming still following behind.
0:6:36|0:6:38|It suddenly turned into a deep attachment.
0:6:39|0:6:45|In Jiao Sanye's home, Shiniang carries lunch from the kitchen to the main hall and places it on the dining table.
0:6:45|0:6:49|You Tianming sat down only after Shiniang sat down.
0:6:52|0:7:4|The three of them picked up their chopsticks and started eating. [You Tianming] lowered his head and began to slurp the porridge in his bowl, the sound making the first lunch together a bit awkward.
0:7:37|0:7:41|[Shiniang] twists together strands of colorful threads.
0:8:0|0:8:5|When talking about her own child, [Shiniang] couldn't help but show a sad expression.
0:8:52|0:8:59|By the side of the Yellow River, several birds freely soar in the reeds, emitting clear and agile calls.
0:8:59|0:9:5|You Tianming ran through the reeds and saw his master Jiao Sanye standing by the river, carrying a shoulder pole and holding a sickle.
0:9:12|0:9:16|You Tianming runs towards Jiao Sanye.
0:9:16|0:9:25|[Jiao Sanye] used a sickle to cut off a reed, trimming off the end with leaves. It was over a meter long, and the reed stem was hollow.
0:9:37|0:9:44|You Tianming took the reed stem from [Shiniang]'s hand, and [Shiniang] bent down to pick up her own things and left.
0:9:44|0:9:49|You Tianming bends down to suck up water, following Shiniang's example.
0:9:52|0:9:56|[Shiniang] gave another reminder before walking away.
0:9:56|0:10:4|You Tianming started to suck in water with all his strength. It was high noon, the sun was scorching, and after a short while of sucking, You Tianming was already sweating profusely.
0:10:6|0:10:13|He took a few deep breaths, continued to drink water, and exerted all his strength, but for You Tianming,
0:10:13|0:10:23|The reed stalk was too long, and he was pushed to the ground by the resistance in an instant.
0:10:23|0:10:30|The camera pulls back, the bright red sunset reflecting in the river, You Tianming still diligently practicing water absorption.
0:10:32|0:10:38|The sky darkened, You Tianming slung his head and carried the reed back to the master's house.
0:10:38|0:10:44|Master is getting ready to have dinner, pouring himself a drink from a small jug.
0:10:49|0:10:55|[Jiao Sanye] angrily slammed the wine pot onto the table, while [Shiniang] walked out of the kitchen with a bowl full of rice.
0:10:55|0:11:0|The master snatched it over and scooped out most of it into his own bowl, leaving only a small portion for [You Tianming].
0:11:8|0:11:18|[Shiniang] looked worriedly at [You Tianming], while [Jiao Sanye] poured himself another small cup of white wine and drank it all in one gulp. [Shiniang] dared not speak again.
0:11:31|0:11:40|Depressed, [You Tianming] lay barefoot on the bed. [Shiniang] walked in with a bowl of sweet potatoes, tickled Tianming's feet, and he turned around and sat up.
0:11:40|0:11:52|[Shiniang] placed the bowl on the bed rail, while [You Tianming] pouted and moved closer. She wiped away the tears from Tianming's face with her hand.
0:11:57|0:12:3|[Shiniang] smiled and pushed the bowl of sweet potatoes towards [You Tianming].
0:12:3|0:12:6|Seeing [You Tianming] unmoved, Jiao Sanye said,
0:12:8|0:12:13|[You Tianming] picked up a sweet potato and ate it with both hands.
0:12:13|0:12:15|[Shiniang] breathed a sigh of relief.
0:12:16|0:12:23|The next day, still in the reed marsh, rustling sounds were heard under the gentle breeze.
0:12:23|0:12:31|[You Tianming] is drawing water by the river, beads of sweat sliding down his face from his exertion, as several villagers carrying reeds pass by.
0:12:58|0:13:5|You Tianming heard the villagers' conversation, paused thoughtfully for a moment, and then began to suck up the water more vigorously.
0:13:6|0:13:11|At this moment, [You Tianming]'s face was as if sprayed with water, covered in sweat.
0:13:11|0:13:14|Finally, [You Tianming] took a sip of water.
0:13:14|0:13:27|He seemed somewhat incredulous, spitting out the water in his mouth, cupping it in his hands, and then excitedly running towards Shiniang's house.
0:13:28|0:13:33|The fish in the river leaped out of the water, and the birds in the Bai Xiang room soared in the air, as if all were cheering for him.
0:13:37|0:13:44|[You Tianming] ran into the house, and the master was splitting the dried reeds.
0:13:46|0:13:50|The master nodded and did not stop his hands from working.
0:13:50|0:13:56|He split another reed stem.
0:13:56|0:14:1|Then he rummaged through the nearby reed pile and found a suitable reed stalk.
0:14:3|0:14:12|Trimmed both ends with scissors and handed it to [You Tianming].
0:14:12|0:14:21|This reed stalk is thicker and longer than the previous one, far exceeding the height of [You Tianming].
0:14:21|0:14:24|[Jiao Sanye] works while talking.
0:14:27|0:14:36|[You Tianming] looked at the reed taller than himself, the sky was covered with dark clouds, thunder rumbling, and suddenly pouring rain.
0:14:36|0:14:45|[You Tianming] looked up at the sky, then knelt by the river and continued practicing water absorption despite the heavy rain.
0:14:45|0:14:47|Shiniang and Brother Er come to find You Tianming.
0:14:53|0:15:1|[Shiniang] holding an umbrella, [Master] wearing a robe, the two with intertwined expressions, walking together, weaving through the reeds.
0:15:1|0:15:7|They saw [You Tianming] by the river, and [Shiniang] quickly ran over to hold an umbrella for him.
0:15:7|0:15:12|[Shifu] threw away the reed in [You Tianming]'s hand, dressed him in a robe, and put his own straw hat on him.
0:15:17|0:15:23|The next morning, the sky, washed by heavy rain, revealed a faint light, making it even more vast.
0:15:23|0:15:31|[You Tianming] lay naked on the bed, slowly opened his eyes, and was drawn to a feather fluttering outside the window.
0:15:31|0:15:38|He got up and knelt by the window. It turned out that the master was planning to take on an apprentice, and the young apprentice [Lan Yu] was blowing feathers.
0:15:39|0:15:44|He walked into the courtyard in his new clothes, with Lan Yu's father standing by.
0:15:44|0:15:50|[You Tianming] looked in amazement as the feather was blown back and forth by Brother Er, never touching the ground.
0:15:50|0:15:54|Brother Er's not-so-tall body unexpectedly blew the feathers over the eaves.
0:15:54|0:15:58|[Jiao Sanye] is preparing feed next to the cattle pen, while [Shiniang] is in Chanzhou.
0:15:58|0:16:1|[Jiao Sanye] walked out holding a small piece of wood.
0:16:37|0:16:58|[Lan Lan] took a few steps back, about a meter away from the wooden board. She turned to look at [Jiao Sanye], who signaled that she could start spraying. [Lan Lan] sprayed with all her might, and the wooden board fell down. [Jiao Sanye] glanced at You Tianming, who lowered his head. [Lan Lan]'s father had a big smile on his face, very satisfied. However, [Jiao Sanye] remained silent in his chair.
0:16:59|0:17:10|Lan Yu's father gestured for Lan Yu to step forward. Still holding a water ladle, Lan Yu walked up to Jiao Sanye and knelt down, ready to pay respects and become his disciple.
0:17:10|0:17:19|[Jiao Sanye] walked into the room with a pipe in his hand, and [Lan Yu]'s father approached.
0:17:22|0:17:27|[Lan Yu] knelt on the ground, with a pair of big, lively eyes.
0:17:27|0:17:33|He turned to look at [You Tianming], who smiled happily.
0:17:33|0:17:38|[Jiao Sanye] took a puff of his cigarette and turned around to speak.
0:17:39|0:17:41|[Lan Yu] looked at his father with shining eyes.
0:17:44|0:17:49|At night, [You Tianming] sat on the edge of the bed playing with his hands, while [Lan Yu] was making the bed.
0:18:10|0:18:13|[You Tianming] picked up the reed placed by the bed.
0:18:16|0:18:24|In the early morning, a thin mist enveloped the river bay, and [Brother Er] and his younger brother came to the river to practice water absorption.
0:18:24|0:18:33|[Lan Yu] barefoot, the two of them bent over, long reeds plunging deep into the river.
0:18:33|0:18:40|It's another early morning, before the two have even gotten up, [You Tianming] suddenly sits up and slaps the sleeping [Lan Yu].
0:18:47|0:18:51|[Lan Yu] propped up and looked around with sleepy eyes.
0:18:51|0:18:55|Next, the two of them ran with sickles to their master's fields.
0:18:55|0:18:58|Master and [Shiniang] are harvesting wheat.
0:18:58|0:19:9|[Lan Yu] ran into the wheat field first, followed by [You Tianming].
0:19:9|0:19:13|The master and [Shiniang] noticed the two of them and stood up to investigate the situation.
0:19:14|0:19:23|Brother Er and his younger brother only showed their heads in the dense bushes that were almost as tall as them, while their master and Shiniang continued to bend over and work hard.
0:19:23|0:19:34|[Lan Yu], despite being young, is very efficient and decisive in her actions. She moves swiftly and skillfully, making [You Tianming]'s movements seem much slower in comparison.
0:19:34|0:19:38|It's just that [Lan Yu] casually threw the cut wheat on the ground, in a disorderly manner.
0:19:42|0:19:49|[You Tianming] shook his head when he saw it, feeling quite speechless. This would add a lot of work later on.
0:19:49|0:19:54|In the master's small courtyard, the [Jiao Sanye] troupe is rehearsing for their overseas performance.
0:19:54|0:20:1|[Jiao Sanye] sat in the middle, with many villagers watching the excitement in the courtyard.
0:20:1|0:20:6|[Shiniang] leaned against the door frame, her face filled with pride and admiration for [Jiao Sanye].
0:20:6|0:20:10|[You Tianming] and [Lan Yu] stared wide-eyed and open-mouthed, completely absorbed in listening.
0:20:29|0:20:33|For over two months, Master took the [Jiao family troupe] to more than a dozen schools.
0:20:37|0:20:46|With [You Tianming] watching the Jiao family leaving in the distance, he then continued to work diligently in the field.
0:21:11|0:21:21|[You Tianming] excitedly ran back to his own home with a cloth bundle on his back.
0:21:31|0:21:34|The father is pushing the millstone to grind flour, then suddenly stops.
0:21:36|0:21:40|The family sat around eating lunch, and the mother asked.
0:22:12|0:22:15|The parents finally felt relieved and smiled with joy.
0:22:15|0:22:17|Father gave [You Tianming] a piece of meat.
0:22:19|0:22:22|The mother happily made a pancake for [You Tianming].
0:22:23|0:22:28|At night, [You Tianming] and his sister lay on the cool mat in the courtyard, getting ready to sleep.
0:22:28|0:22:33|The mother was gently fanning herself with a palm-leaf fan while the younger sister had already fallen asleep.
0:22:33|0:22:37|[You Tianming] still had his eyes wide open, showing no signs of drowsiness.
0:22:37|0:22:40|The father sat on a lounge chair on the side.
0:22:44|0:22:48|The mother looked puzzled and turned to ask [Jiao Sanye].
0:22:49|0:22:51|[You Tianming] stood up somewhat smugly.
0:23:1|0:23:4|Father stood up from Tang Yi.
0:23:12|0:23:17|Facing his father's expectations, [You Tianming] seemed to have understood something and said firmly.
0:23:59|0:24:4|The father leaned back in his reclining chair again, looking at the night sky while fanning himself with a palm-leaf fan.
0:24:16|0:24:22|The next day, [You Tianming] was carrying corn from a storage room to a basket.
0:24:22|0:24:26|[Lan Yu] covered his eyes from behind.
0:24:26|0:24:28|[You Tianming] pried [Lan Yu]'s hand open.
0:24:40|0:24:44|[You Tianming] led [Lan Yu] towards his father who was tidying up the sheep pen.
0:25:1|0:25:4|At this moment, the younger sister returned with the sheep.
0:25:5|0:25:7|[You Tianming] introduces [Lan Yu].
0:25:11|0:25:15|Later, the three of them played on the swing in the village together.
0:25:15|0:25:20|Xiu Zhi, the younger sister, sat on the swing and swung very high with the help of her two brothers.
0:25:20|0:25:25|Next, Xiuzhi and [Lan Yu] sat on the swing together, while [You Tianming] pushed them from behind.
0:25:25|0:25:32|The innocent and radiant smiles bloomed on the faces of Jiao Sanye, You Tianming, and Brother Er, enjoying the most beautiful time of their childhood.
0:25:32|0:25:41|At night, three people catch fireflies together, with the fireflies flying all over the sky, emitting twinkling lights.
0:25:41|0:25:47|The three children excitedly jumped around as if they were having a firefly-catching competition.
0:25:47|0:26:8|They gathered together and slowly opened their tightly held hands. The green light emitted by the fireflies illuminated their faces. The three of them looked in amazement as the fireflies flew out of their hands, soaring into the air and blending into the tranquil and beautiful rural night scene.
0:26:8|0:26:17|Tianming and [Lan Yu] returned to [Shiniang]'s house, where [Shiniang] took down a box from the top of the wardrobe in the bedroom. Despite being covered in thick dust, it was still exquisite.
0:26:19|0:26:24|Shiniang opens the box, inside are various types of locks.
0:26:24|0:26:31|Shiniang took out a very small lock from a small cloth bag to show to her two disciples.
0:26:56|0:27:1|[Lan Yu] carefully took the precious sona from [Shiniang]'s hands.
0:27:1|0:27:4|[Shiniang] picked up a sona again and said to [Lan Yu].
0:27:9|0:27:11|Shiniang hands the anger card to Lan Yu.
0:27:17|0:27:25|[Lan Yu], full of joy, took the harmonica and blew with all his might, but the harmonica did not make a sound.
0:27:25|0:27:28|The master took out a flat whistle.
0:27:30|0:27:34|The master inserted the whistle into the air vent and tested it, then held the sonar to watch Lan Yu.
0:27:48|0:27:52|[Lan Yu] nodded vigorously and took the sonar with both hands.
0:27:52|0:27:59|The master took out a fishing rod from the box and blew off the dust on it.
0:27:59|0:28:5|[You Tianming] thought this was for his Sonya, just about to reach out and take it, but the master put it back in the box directly.
0:28:5|0:28:10|Master reached out to take back the Qing Dynasty sonar from [You Tianming], who handed it over with both hands.
0:28:14|0:28:29|The master put it back into the velvet bag, placed it in the box, closed the lid, and put the box back in the bedroom.
0:28:29|0:28:36|[You Tianming] was a little anxious and puzzled, staring straight ahead in the direction his master had left.
0:28:36|0:28:40|At night, [Lan Yu] half lay on the bed, constantly fiddling with her lock.
0:28:44|0:28:50|[You Tianming] sat on the edge of the bed, crying and packing his luggage, occasionally wiping away tears with his arm.
0:28:54|0:28:59|Tianming remained silent and continued folding his clothes.
0:28:59|0:29:1|[Lan Yu] approached and asked with concern.
0:29:17|0:29:26|The next day, just as dawn was breaking, You Tianming carried his bedding and luggage and walked out of his master's house.
0:29:26|0:29:32|He stood on the hill where his father had sent him, glanced in the direction of his master's house, and continued on his way.
0:29:37|0:29:43|Entering his own home, he happened to overhear his father's conversation, so he hid behind the wall.
0:31:4|0:31:14|Whether you believe it or not, after hearing his father's words, Tianming resolutely walked out of the house and returned to his master's home.
0:31:14|0:31:22|Shiniang is repairing farm tools in the yard at this moment. He hides behind the shadow wall and peeks out. When Shiniang notices him, he quickly pulls his head back.
0:31:24|0:31:28|Tianming walked out from behind the wall excitedly, and the earth dog Niu Niu went to greet him.
0:31:34|0:31:37|He placed his bedding and luggage on the lid of the water tank.
0:31:47|0:31:55|Tianming carried the meal from the kitchen to the hall and found a lock on the table, next to it was a cloth bag with compartments.
0:31:59|0:32:5|Tianming sat down with a mixture of belief and doubt, looking at the suona on the table, tears shimmering in his eyes.
0:32:12|0:32:16|[You Tianming] slowly picks up the suona on the table.
0:32:20|0:32:25|[You Tianming] carefully examined the suona, tears welling up in his eyes.
0:32:30|0:32:36|[Jiao Sanye] sat on the lounge chair outside, while [You Tianming] inside the house was already in tears.
0:32:42|0:32:50|[You Tianming] looked at [Shiniang] gratefully, while [Shiniang] sat in a lounge chair smoking, the scene before her gradually blurred in tears.
0:32:53|0:32:58|In the following days, Brother Er and Jiao Sanye learned to play the suona under the guidance of Shiniang.
0:32:58|0:33:3|In the courtyard, they stood in front of [Shiniang], she blew a sentence, and they followed with a sentence.
0:33:16|0:33:21|[Shiniang] is extremely serious, demonstrating each movement and rhythm repeatedly.
0:33:21|0:33:24|Brother Er and Jiao Sanye are also studying diligently.
0:33:24|0:33:32|They came from the courtyard to the Yellow River where they had practiced water absorption before, with the wide water surface and the magnificent eight hundred li of the Qin Chuan Plain as the background.
0:33:32|0:33:35|They focused on each finger technique, practicing with more vigor.
0:33:44|0:34:6|[Lan Yu], attracted by various bird calls, walked into the grass and trees by the river, searching for the birds' traces, only to discover [Jiao Sanye].
0:34:11|0:34:27|Lan Yu walked carefully to Jiao Sanye, who stood with his hands on his hips, carefully listening to his daughter's call. He then used a whistle and gestures to imitate a lively call.
0:34:27|0:34:31|In the distance, there seemed to be a response, but it was still unclear. [Jiao Sanye] imitated another sound.
0:34:36|0:34:41|In the distance, the response sounded, and [Shiniang] led Lan Yu forward with a smile.
0:34:41|0:34:50|They saw [You Tianming] practicing bird calls deep in the thick bushes.
0:34:50|0:34:55|Shiniang was pleasantly surprised and let out a sigh.
0:34:55|0:34:57|Tianming turned around, looking surprised.
0:34:59|0:35:1|[Lan Yu] ran to [You Tianming]'s side.
0:35:3|0:35:10|[Shiniang] laughed with her mouth wide open, coming to [You Tianming]'s side.
0:35:13|0:35:21|[Lan Yu] reacted quickly, extending three fingers.
0:35:37|0:36:13|The cicadas are not birds. Tianming carefully distinguished for a while, saying that besides the three types of trees planted by [Lan Yu] in childhood, there are also yellow birds, cranes, kites, eagles, and swallows. There is one type you haven't heard of. [Shiniang] casually picked a thin leaf from the tree next to her, put it near her mouth, and imitated it with gestures.
0:36:13|0:36:22|In the distance, the birds unexpectedly responded.
0:36:22|0:36:25|Shiniang lovingly touched the noses of her two disciples.
0:36:28|0:36:32|In the evening, the Jiao family troupe rehearses in the courtyard of [Jiao Sanye]'s house.
0:36:39|0:36:45|[You Tianming] and [Lan Yu] sit on the millstone, facing each other, feeling a bit embarrassed.
0:36:45|0:36:50|[Lan Yu] stood up first, took a whistle out of his ear, and gave it a try.
0:36:50|0:36:53|[Jiao Sanye] walked out of the house, and [Lan Yu] started playing the flute.
0:36:56|0:37:3|[Lan Yu] swayed her body slightly with the rhythm, playing the flute skillfully.
0:37:3|0:37:18|The second senior brothers of the teaching family looked on with approval, listening with relish.
0:37:18|0:37:21|The master sat in front of the dining table, fanning himself with a fan and listening with his eyes closed.
0:37:38|0:37:40|You Tianming stood up with a frown.
0:38:0|0:38:18|Continuing, [You Tianming] then individually dismantled the lock-sodium bowl, and walked to the dining table to pick up a rice bowl, imitating it.
0:38:18|0:38:20|Brother Er stood up and said to the master.
0:38:23|0:38:42|Today we'll stop here, and tomorrow we have a long journey ahead. Everyone pack up and get ready to leave. Tomorrow, [You Tianming] will also go with us. [You Tianming] is pleasantly surprised. The next day, two boys of similar age to You Tianming carry a stele into Jiao Sanye's house.
0:38:42|0:38:46|Everyone put their locks and other musical instruments into the stele tower.
0:38:46|0:38:49|The boy wants to put You Tianming's lock of hair into the stele tower.
0:39:6|0:39:14|At the bustling Bai Market, Master leads his apprentices in a chaotic performance, while You Tianming and [Lan Yu] watch from the side.
0:39:27|0:39:38|Suddenly, [Lan Lan] saw Xiuzhi in the crowd. She thought she was mistaken, rubbed her eyes, looked carefully, and saw Xiuzhi hiding behind the adults, looking at her with a mix of reluctance and hesitation.
0:40:25|0:40:33|You Tianming stood up and looked at the master, [Jiao Sanye] shook his head.
0:40:41|0:40:43|Jiao Sanye smiled and shook his head as usual.
0:40:57|0:40:59|He stood up and walked to the portrait of his father.
0:41:23|0:41:30|In the past, there were five surnames in Jing Zhuang: Zhang, Wang, Qian, Li, and Zha.
0:41:33|0:41:35|Most people with other surnames have been pushed out.
0:41:38|0:41:44|You Tianming, who had been paying close attention to the situation, sat down and locked eyes with [Lan Yu].
0:41:44|0:41:50|In the evening, the troupe of [Jiao Sanye] sat around eating together.
0:42:2|0:42:10|Beside the grassy path, [Lan Yu] imitated the adults by lighting up a cigarette.
0:42:10|0:42:23|Tianming also lit a cigarette with a kerosene lamp and choked after taking a puff.
0:42:23|0:42:25|He rubbed the cigarette on the sole of his shoe twice.
0:42:32|0:42:43|Tianming was already falling asleep, responding with half-hearted replies.
0:42:43|0:42:46|Before long, both of them fell asleep.
0:42:46|0:42:50|But at this moment, [You Tianming]'s foot touched the kerosene lamp on the side, and the kerosene immediately ignited the straw.
0:42:54|0:43:5|A villager saw the fire and [You Tianming] quickly woke up [Lan Yu]. [You Tianming] immediately went to get the lock placed aside.
0:43:41|0:43:47|You Tianming, with a grimy face and furrowed brow, lowered his head and dared not speak.
0:43:47|0:43:59|Lan Yu, who was standing beside You Tianming, looked at him with concern. She lowered her head to look at the lock in her hand and gathered the courage to say,
0:44:6|0:44:16|His master's expression changed slightly, but You Tianming still kept his head down.
0:44:16|0:44:22|[Shiniang] turned and walked away.
0:44:43|0:44:49|The scorching heat fades away, the frozen earth, the passing of spring and autumn, another year has come.
0:44:49|0:44:55|[Shiniang] taught by example, in that river bend, the master and disciples spent day after day together.
0:44:55|0:44:59|In the courtyard of [Shiniang]'s house, [You Tianming] and [Lan Yu] are playing a duet in front of the ancestral tablet.
0:45:4|0:45:23|Today is the day of the Jiao Sanye family's succession ceremony. The so-called succession is the ceremony where the master of the Sona troupe determines the successor. He is not only passing on the mockingbird's playing skills, but also passing on a kind of honor. It is the best affirmation of a Sona artist's character and artistry.
0:45:35|0:45:41|The courtyard was filled with members of the Jiao family, Brother Er's parents, and other villagers.
0:45:41|0:45:49|After years of practice, Jiao Sanye and You Tianming have become very proficient in their swordplay, and their performances have become more confident.
0:45:49|0:45:55|The people in the courtyard couldn't help but smile and sway their bodies to the rhythm.
0:45:55|0:46:0|After the performance, the two children immediately ran to find their parents.
0:46:0|0:46:3|The audience praised the performances of these two young actors.
0:46:7|0:46:16|[Jiao Sanye] walked out of the house, holding a cloth-wrapped sonar in his hand.
0:47:48|0:47:51|[Jiao Sanye] takes out the Sonar from the cloth bag.
0:48:30|0:48:33|[Jiao Sanye] waved in the direction of [You Tianming].
0:48:35|0:48:40|You Tianming was momentarily stunned, while a confident Lan Yu also had an incredulous look on her face.
0:48:42|0:48:50|Upon his father's reminder, [You Tianming] walked up to the master, causing [Lan Yu] to deflate instantly. The master bent down and spoke to [You Tianming].
0:49:46|0:49:50|Shiniang stood up to comfort Lan Yu.
0:50:8|0:50:16|[Jiao Sanye] shook his pipe over the sole of his shoe, placed it on the table, and then got up and went back to his room.
0:50:20|0:50:23|[Shiniang] holds [Lan Yu]'s hand and continues to comfort him.
0:50:27|0:50:37|The next morning, [Lan Yu] packed up his belongings and stood in the courtyard.
0:50:42|0:50:44|Shiniang walks out.
0:50:52|0:50:55|[You Tianming] walked out of the room, reluctant to look at his junior brother.
0:51:1|0:51:4|After kowtowing, Shiniang quickly helped him up.
0:51:11|0:51:21|[Lan Yu] held back tears, [Shiniang] also felt reluctant, forced a smile, waved goodbye to [Lan Yu].
0:51:21|0:51:24|[Lan Yu] had reached the entrance when he was stopped by [You Tianming].
0:51:26|0:51:31|Lan Yu turned around and glanced at [You Tianming], who shed tears.
0:51:31|0:51:41|Lan Yu resolutely turned around and left the master's house, walking alone on the country road.
0:51:41|0:51:45|[You Tianming] chased to the door and watched, [Shiniang] also chased out.
0:51:45|0:51:49|At this moment, [Jiao Sanye] appeared at the intersection.
0:51:58|0:52:5|In the following days, the master taught [You Tianming] to play the mockingbird.
0:52:5|0:52:14|In this rural courtyard, the master sat on a stool, with [You Tianming] standing in front of him, still responding to the master's words.
0:52:39|0:52:46|The locked bowl's opening, like a continuously blooming flower, emitted a clear voice flowing out from it.
0:52:46|0:52:51|Just like that, [You Tianming] has grown from a young man into a young adult.
0:53:2|0:53:7|[Jiao Sanye] passed on the Jiao family's skills to the young [You Tianming] in the hall.
0:53:33|0:53:35|But when this day really comes,
0:53:49|0:53:50|You Ben Sheng was very excited.
0:54:2|0:54:4|You Ben excitedly ran back home.
0:54:6|0:54:11|In the home of You Tianming, Sixi lights a cigarette for You Bensheng.
0:54:37|0:54:39|Xiuzhi came out to pour water for Sixi.
0:55:6|0:55:10|[You Tianming] brought the You family gang to the wedding scene of his childhood friend Changsheng.
0:55:10|0:55:14|Tianming saw the groom Changsheng with a big red flower on his chest and said,
0:55:31|0:55:34|[You Tianming] does not smoke and politely declined Changsheng.
0:55:34|0:55:36|Changsheng distributed cigarettes to others.
0:56:10|0:56:31|Following Jiao Sanye all the way, at this moment, the two newcomers kneel and bow in front of the ancestral hall. Liu Jiabang has been playing in the courtyard all along. Sixi hands out cigarettes to the members of Liu Jiabang. Liu Jiabang's shot is placed on the table. Other senior brothers directly hand the cigarettes to the courtyard. Tang Sheng walks over.
0:56:44|0:56:48|Changsheng gave everyone a red envelope.
0:56:48|0:56:53|You Tianming's red envelope is different from others, containing a one hundred yuan bill.
0:56:53|0:56:57|Brother Er happily counted his red envelopes.
0:56:57|0:57:6|You Tianming stood up and gave everyone another hundred bucks.
0:57:13|0:57:19|Everyone was very satisfied, with some even kissing the banknotes directly.
0:57:19|0:57:34|In Jiao Sanye's home, Shiniang breaks open a steamed bun at the stove, adds some vegetables inside, wraps it up with cloth, and occasionally picks up fallen vegetables on the stove to eat.
0:57:36|0:57:41|[Shiniang] shouted while wrapping the glass jar containing porridge.
0:57:42|0:57:45|[Shiniang] walked out of the kitchen with a bowl of rice.
0:57:45|0:57:49|Tu Gou Niuniu is standing in front of the door, with two cloth bags draped over her.
0:57:49|0:57:51|[Shiniang] packed the lunch into the bag.
0:57:54|0:58:2|Niuniu ran out of the house with her lunchbox, ran across the field and dirt road, and plunged into the vegetable garden.
0:58:2|0:58:4|Jiao Sanye is working in the vegetable field.
0:58:7|0:58:12|He took out lunch from Jiao Jiao's bag and was about to eat.
0:58:24|0:58:27|Shiniang puts the lunch back into Jiaojiao's cloth bag.
0:58:27|0:58:33|At home, [Shiniang] squats on the ground, washing and wiping the feet of [Jiao Sanye] who has just returned from the fields.
0:58:36|0:58:40|[Jiao Sanye] put on his shoes and walked into the hall.
1:0:36|1:0:38|In the evening, [Shiniang] is weaving cloth in front of the loom.
1:0:42|1:0:48|[Shifu] found a jar of rare old wine covered in a layer of dust.
1:1:2|1:1:23|[Jiao Sanye] carefully wiped the blanket with a cloth, then carefully unfolded the red cloth covering the blanket. [You Tianming] moved the wine cup closer to [Shiniang], who then took out a sieve, sniffed it, and then offered it to [You Tianming] to smell.
1:1:24|1:1:28|[Shifu] poured wine into the bowl very carefully, afraid of spilling a drop.
1:1:35|1:1:36|After finishing speaking, he quickly stuffed the cork back in.
1:1:36|1:1:37|Master and disciple raised their cups, both took a small sip first, then continued to drink a big gulp.
1:2:52|1:3:3|Come, we've eaten most of the five bowls of homestyle dishes on the table, and we've had three rounds of drinks.
1:3:5|1:3:9|[Jiao Sanye] had a bit too much to drink, and he opened the precious box containing the Sona.
1:3:15|1:3:18|He took out the delicate Qing Dynasty suona.
1:3:30|1:3:31|[Jiao Sanye] pretends to be angry.
1:3:39|1:3:46|Xiaosi Xiansun knelt down in gratitude, overwhelmed with thanks.
1:3:57|1:4:2|Fueled by alcohol, [Jiao Sanye] played a cheerful tune on the flute, dancing like a child as he played.
1:4:8|1:4:12|Beside, Shen Yang, who was weaving, showed a simple and happy smile.
1:4:12|1:4:18|Suddenly, Jiao Sanye also exhausted his strength and knelt down on the ground.
1:4:37|1:4:54|Tianming went up to help, but [Jiao Sanye] pushed his hand away.
1:4:54|1:4:58|[Jiao Sanye] lay down on the ground directly, and [You Tianming] and [Shiniang] quickly rushed over.
1:5:2|1:5:7|Master Jiao Sanye was actually asleep drunk, with a slight smile on the corner of his mouth.
1:5:18|1:5:30|[You Tianming] stayed at [Shifu]'s house for one night. The next morning, [Tianming] got up and walked into the courtyard, shouting while putting on his shirt.
1:5:34|1:5:43|No one was home, [You Tianming] came to the kitchen, lifted the lid of the pot on the stove, inside was a bowl of sweet potatoes left for him by [Shiniang], still steaming.
1:5:43|1:5:48|[You Tianming] picked up one and started eating.
1:5:48|1:5:49|He walked out of the kitchen and entered the main hall.
1:5:53|1:5:59|Put the sweet potato on the table, then took out all the money from his own pocket.
1:5:59|1:6:9|He counted the money, intending to leave only the exact change, but hesitated and placed all the money on the table, using [Shiniang]'s old radio to hold it down.
1:6:13|1:6:22|[Master] and [Shiniang] have been working in the field, [You Tianming] arrived at the vegetable field with his luggage, but he just took a glance from afar and continued on his way.
1:6:29|1:6:33|It's still the same small path where her father brought her to apprentice.
1:6:33|1:6:38|You Tianming's current pace now carries a hint of determination and responsibility.
1:6:38|1:6:45|In You Tianming's home, his sister Xiuzhi, wearing a floral dress, hurriedly walked into the yard, getting ready to ride her bike to work.
1:6:51|1:6:59|The mother put the lunchbox in her bicycle basket, and she met the just-returned Tianming at the door.
1:7:55|1:8:5|In the bustling market of Wushuang Town, You Tianming arrived at a stall and picked up a small item to examine.
1:8:5|1:8:11|Suddenly someone covered his eyes from behind, and he was just about to break free.
1:8:25|1:8:27|In the evening, Brother Er and Jiao Sanye were drinking and eating in Lan Yu's yard.
1:8:59|1:9:0|They raised their glasses.
1:9:8|1:9:13|[You Tianming] lowered his head and smiled helplessly.
1:9:15|1:9:20|[Lan Yu] had another drink.
1:9:45|1:9:47|Tianming looked shocked.
1:10:6|1:10:10|[Lan Lan] got up and went into the room to take out her wallet.
1:10:10|1:10:13|Pull out a photo from the wallet.
1:10:13|1:10:16|This is a photo of [Lan Lan] and Xiuzhi.
1:10:30|1:10:35|Lan Lan took a bite of the dish and said.
1:10:54|1:11:1|The next day, the companions of the You family in the forest cave were offering various foods and wine for the birthday celebration of the elder of the You family.
1:11:22|1:11:26|Then he passed cigarettes to everyone.
1:11:26|1:11:30|The foreign band begins tuning their instruments.
1:11:30|1:11:34|Lan Lan said
1:11:34|1:11:37|On the stage stands a sexy female singer.
1:11:47|1:11:50|[You Tianming] stood up and walked towards the foreign band.
1:11:51|1:12:0|[You Tianming] fixed his eyes on the performance of the foreign band and walked forward.
1:12:0|1:12:4|In front of the foreign band, many lively citizens have already gathered.
1:12:4|1:12:7|The drumsticks were set up to strike the frame, in coordination with the other bands.
1:13:5|1:13:10|Master couldn't quite recognize the grown-up Lan Yu, and awkwardly smiled.
1:13:10|1:13:15|At this moment, more and more people suddenly returned to the foreigner's side.
1:13:15|1:13:20|The female singer started singing.
1:13:20|1:13:27|The female singer is dressed in a leopard-print tight dress, wearing a necklace, and styled in a happy and fashionable manner.
1:13:45|1:13:47|[Jiao Sanye] said angrily.
1:13:55|1:13:58|You Tianming took the wine bottle directly and took a sip.
1:14:2|1:14:5|The sudden sound of the suona startled the female singer on stage.
1:14:52|1:15:0|In front of the Eastern Band, layers of audience surrounded them, contrasting sharply with the deserted and lonely wanderers.
1:15:0|1:15:14|In the crowd, there was a young man with a wonderful mirror. His classmates didn't want to disturb him, so he led his little brother to [You Tianming].
1:15:14|1:15:20|He patted You Tianming's shoulder, but You Tianming ignored him.
1:15:49|1:15:52|You Tianming stood up with a punch, also giving Lan Lan a heavy blow.
1:16:26|1:16:30|Everyone stopped, and the foreign band also stopped playing.
1:16:30|1:16:40|[Jiao Sanye] looked around desolately and saw the scattered and deformed Sonas on the ground that had been trampled on.
1:16:40|1:16:46|He picked it up tenderly, holding it in his hand, gazing into the distance with a dazed look.
1:16:53|1:16:59|[Jiao Sanye] walked out of the Lei family with his hands behind his back, followed by [Lan Yu] and the You family troupe.
1:17:1|1:17:6|[Jiao Sanye] ignored it, and everyone stopped following.
1:17:6|1:17:10|[Lan Lan] placed her hand on [You Tianming]'s shoulder to comfort him.
1:17:10|1:17:17|[Jiao Sanye] walked alone briskly on the country road, his gradually receding figure appearing lonely and desolate.
1:17:19|1:17:23|In the home of You Tianming, his mother brewed a pot of Chinese medicine and poured it into a bowl.
1:17:23|1:17:30|Tianming sat on the bed and drank heartily, then took a sip of water to rinse his mouth.
1:17:30|1:17:33|The mother touched Tianming's forehead.
1:17:35|1:17:39|The mother arranged the pillow for Tianming to lie down.
1:17:48|1:17:55|The mother poured water into a bowl.
1:18:33|1:18:38|The father closed the box with his foot and walked out carrying an iron bucket.
1:18:44|1:18:50|Father looked towards the gate and asked, "Who died?"
1:19:38|1:19:38|[You Tianming] is at a loss.
1:19:38|1:19:40|At this moment, [Jiao Sanye] learned the news and rushed angrily to the home of [You Tianming].
1:19:40|1:19:41|At this point, he was already very ill.
1:20:5|1:20:9|[Jiao Sanye] was emotionally agitated and muttered a few words.
1:20:9|1:20:13|At that moment, Jiao Sanye, feeling short of breath, leaned on the flower stand next to him.
1:20:13|1:20:17|[You Tianming] hurried over and gently patted the back of his master.
1:20:17|1:20:19|[Jiao Sanye] turned around and sat on the flower terrace.
1:21:5|1:21:8|[Shiniang] rushed out and then turned around.
1:21:12|1:21:16|[You Tianming] followed the master out.
1:21:16|1:21:19|[Jiao Sanye] kicked open the iron gate of [Brother Er]'s house and rushed into the courtyard.
1:21:26|1:21:33|[Brother Er] and [Jiao Sanye] locked eyes, feeling both fear and guilt. Brother Er was packing his bags, preparing to leave.
1:21:33|1:21:42|[Jiao Sanye] directly threw the clothes that had been packed into the snake skin bag out, some of them flew directly onto [You Tianming]'s head.
1:21:42|1:21:48|Brother Er's mother is bedridden, and she sees Jiao Sanye throwing clothes vigorously through the window.
1:21:48|1:21:54|[Brother Er] stood aside, his body trembling slightly, as [Jiao Sanye] emptied the clothes from the bag.
1:21:57|1:22:2|The pig raised at home ran out of the pigsty, also wearing a piece of clothing.
1:22:2|1:22:17|[Brother Er] walked over, drove him away, picked up the scattered clothes in the yard one by one, and even knelt down to pick up the clothes.
1:22:17|1:22:24|He picked up a handful of clothes and tried to put them back into the bag, but was stopped by [Jiao Sanye] stepping on the bag with one foot.
1:22:24|1:22:26|Brother Er looks up at the master.
1:22:28|1:22:34|Jiao Sanye stepped even harder as he bent down to tug at the bag.
1:22:34|1:22:44|In the end, [Jiao Sanye] kicked [Brother Er] aside, while the mother, who was seriously ill in the room, trembled her lips and shed tears.
1:22:44|1:22:48|[Brother Er] supported his body with his arms, his nose bleeding.
1:22:50|1:22:54|He wiped his nose with his hand and then looked at his master.
1:22:54|1:23:1|[Jiao Sanye] calmed down and, seeing his disciple injured, he turned his head slightly with a hint of concern.
1:23:1|1:23:5|[Jiao Sanye] glanced back at [Brother Er], then walked out of the house in silence.
1:23:5|1:23:11|[You Tianming] quickly caught up.
1:23:11|1:23:16|At sunset in the west, [Jiao Sanye] walked on the path with his persuaded disciple and [You Tianming].
1:23:24|1:23:29|Big Brother stopped in his tracks and waited for [You Tianming] to approach, then spoke to him.
1:23:38|1:23:42|[You Tianming] did not respond and continued to follow the master.
1:23:42|1:23:49|[Jiao Sanye] led his disciples to Huozhuang and met You Ben Sheng, who was carrying a drum at the village entrance.
1:23:54|1:23:58|[Jiao Sanye] lit three incense sticks at the memorial hall and paid his respects to Village Chief Dou.
1:24:10|1:24:14|Village Chief Dou fought against the Japanese devils and taught bandits.
1:24:17|1:24:19|The stone broke four ribs.
1:24:37|1:24:41|The descendants of Village Chief Dou sent this letter to [Jiao Sanye].
1:24:54|1:25:1|The villagers stared at the somewhat unfamiliar face, [You Tianming] stood up nervously as his father walked over.
1:25:5|1:25:7|Big Brother spoke to [Jiao Sanye].
1:25:11|1:25:16|[Jiao Sanye] looked at [You Tianming], his cheeks flushed and his forehead covered in cold sweat due to a fever.
1:25:18|1:25:22|[Jiao Sanye] thought for a moment, stood up and said.
1:25:22|1:25:30|Everyone saw that the head of the You family troupe was sick and did not immediately blow the white bird to mock.
1:25:38|1:25:45|You Tianming locked the ground for the master, who was sitting on the central grandmaster chair, and gestured to the disciples.
1:25:54|1:26:2|[Jiao Sanye] blew the white bird mockingly with all his might.
1:26:2|1:26:11|Sonarson was crying and telling the story, which deeply moved the descendants of Dou Village and other villagers.
1:26:11|1:26:13|You Tianming cooperated with his master on the side.
1:27:47|1:27:56|Suddenly, [You Tianming] noticed that red blood was dripping from the master's Sona bowl.
1:27:56|1:28:0|He noticed the blood with his ability.
1:28:0|1:28:4|[Jiao Sanye] couldn't help but cough twice and spat out a mouthful of blood.
1:28:8|1:28:11|The disciples gathered around, with the villagers watching anxiously.
1:28:21|1:28:25|The disciples carried the drum to [Jiao Sanye].
1:28:26|1:28:29|The master tidies up his clothes and prepares to beat the drum.
1:28:33|1:28:34|[Jiao Sanye] said to [You Tianming].
1:28:35|1:28:38|Unable to persuade the stubborn [Jiao Sanye], everyone had to continue playing.
1:28:56|1:29:1|[Jiao Sanye] first leaned against it to knock, and then stood up like everyone else.
1:29:1|1:29:8|He looked up at You Tianming, who was playing with great dedication, tears shimmering in his eyes.
1:29:8|1:29:15|[Jiao Sanye] showed a contented smile on his pale face, then he struck with even more endurance.
1:29:59|1:30:3|[You Tianming] looked dazed, unable to accept it for a moment.
1:30:9|1:30:11|You Tianming's eyes were filled with despair.
1:30:12|1:30:29|Later, [Jiao Sanye] lay on a wooden pie car, while [You Tianming] and two senior martial brothers crossed the rugged mountain road together, escorting their master back home.
1:30:29|1:30:31|In You Tianming's home
1:30:46|1:30:54|At night, under dim lights, [Jiao Sanye] is in the cowshed, brushing the cow's fur with a brush.
1:30:54|1:30:56|He said to [You Tianming]
1:31:4|1:31:13|The next day, a drizzle fell from the sky, and [Jiao Sanye] struggled to cover the cow's back with a shuttle.
1:31:18|1:31:25|[You Tianming] set off with the cow.
1:31:25|1:31:29|[Shiniang] chased out of the house, unwilling to watch the direction where the ox was leaving.
1:31:33|1:31:41|You Tianming placed the money from selling the cow on Jiao Sanye's bedside, bought a pair of shoes for the master, and Shiniang sat by the bed.
1:31:41|1:31:42|[Jiao Sanye] even lost the strength to shake his head.
1:32:39|1:32:41|You Tianming lowered his head.
1:32:45|1:32:53|Before going to bed at night, You Tianming helps his master wipe his body on the bed.
1:32:53|1:32:55|Jiao Sanye still can't forget about the lock bag.
1:33:7|1:33:10|You Tianming hesitated for a moment.
1:33:14|1:33:20|[Jiao Sanye] found some comfort.
1:33:20|1:33:25|Seeing the master coughing severely, Tianming and [Shiniang] quickly helped him up to ease his breath.
1:33:25|1:33:28|[Jiao Sanye] slowly regained consciousness on Tianming's arm.
1:33:46|1:33:53|[Shiniang] couldn't hold back anymore, turned around, and wiped away her tears secretly.
1:34:10|1:34:15|You Tianming pressed his face against the master's face and started crying.
1:34:15|1:34:18|The next day, You Bensheng went to Jiao Sanye's house.
1:34:22|1:34:25|This is the deputy director of the County Cultural Bureau.
1:34:50|1:34:52|Li Wu is drinking Chinese medicine, and Jiao Sanye hears it.
1:35:9|1:35:14|A train enters the scene, arriving in Xi'an from Tianming City.
1:35:14|1:35:20|He ran around the streets and finally found a construction site of an ancient building, led by Brother Er.
1:35:20|1:35:27|[Lan Yu], [Lan Yu] and Xiuzhi are all on the rooftop.
1:35:30|1:35:38|In the evening, Brother Er was cooking in the kitchen of the construction site dormitory. He served the last dish on the table, while Jiao Sanye played the suona beside him.
1:35:41|1:35:44|Former brothers sat around together.
1:35:52|1:35:56|[Brother Er] picked up a steamed bun, and Tianming noticed the abnormality on Brother Er's ring finger.
1:36:1|1:36:3|Xiuzhi turned her head and whispered.
1:36:10|1:36:12|[Brother Er] covers his disabled left hand and says despondently.
1:36:12|1:36:13|Third Brother suddenly started coughing violently, and [Lan Yu] gently patted his back.
1:36:35|1:36:37|Niu Tianming remained silent with his head down.
1:36:37|1:36:42|The next day, Tianming, Xiuzhi, and [Lan Lan] were taking a walk in front of Yongning Gate.
1:37:1|1:37:2|Lan Lan continues speaking.
1:37:23|1:37:27|Lan Lan and Xiuzhi are both unable to deal with You Tianming.
1:37:27|1:37:29|Suddenly, they were attracted by the sound of suona.
1:37:31|1:37:36|Not far away, there is a thin old man playing the suona, with a tea jar beside him.
1:37:36|1:37:41|Two young girls walked over and dropped a few coins into the tea jar.
1:37:48|1:37:51|[You Tianming] saw this scene, feeling a mix of emotions in his heart.
1:37:58|1:38:4|Remaining, the lush green rice seedlings and the green pines covering the mountains appear vibrant and full of life.
1:38:12|1:38:15|Ding A'niu was also crouching next to the tombstone.
1:38:15|1:38:25|[You Tianming] was alone, wearing a red vest that only performers would wear, and tied with a red silk sash, playing the Hundred Birds Mocking tune for his master.
1:38:26|1:38:34|He seemed to see his master sitting on the grandmaster chair, with a stern exterior hiding a passionate heart.
1:38:34|1:38:51|[Jiao Sanye] saw Liu Chunming's shoulder injury and smiled with relief.
1:38:51|1:38:54|Scenes of learning swordsmanship with the master in the past are vivid in memory.
1:38:56|1:39:1|Master's proud and smiling face is forever engraved in Tianming's heart.
1:39:1|1:39:8|In the small courtyard of the master's house, the young You Tianming followed the master to learn Soru sentence by sentence, unknowingly accumulating a whole night.
1:39:55|1:40:15|Upon becoming the disciple of Mengzi, You Tianming returned to his master's house for the first time. His master was drunk, so happy that he acted like a child with his hands blocking his head.
1:40:50|1:40:57|You Tianming in front of the grave was already in tears.
1:40:57|1:41:8|[Jiao Sanye] stood up from the grandmaster's chair, with a look of reluctance, turned around and walked briskly towards the distance alone, gradually disappearing from the frame.
