0:0:47|0:0:55|A ship sailed by as Li Xiaolu was smoking at home. There were two photos and a plaster statue on the windowsill.
0:1:14|0:1:33|The sheet music and newspapers were scattered on the ground, with [Cheng Yi]'s legs crossed on the stool. He occasionally rubbed his feet, holding a pen in one hand to write on the paper, and a cigarette in the other hand, taking a deep drag. The fan in front of him was not enough to dispel the heat. He rolled up a piece of paper in his hand and wiped the sweat off.
0:1:33|0:1:42|After wiping, he casually threw the roll of paper on the table, picked up the written score, stood up and walked to the piano, placing his newly written score on it.
0:1:57|0:2:1|Li Xiaolu looked towards the door with sincerity. The landlord walked up the steps and sat down.
0:2:33|0:2:44|[Cheng Yi] took out the paper ball that was just stuffed into his left ear, leaned towards the door and then removed the paper ball from his right ear, the scene shifted to the restaurant where a man with glasses was holding a ring box.
0:2:59|0:3:11|The man with glasses held the ring box tightly in his hand, smiling. He looked outside the shop and happily stood up, but his smile disappeared when he heard his girlfriend speak.
0:3:35|0:3:55|The man with glasses looked sadly as his girlfriend left. Meanwhile, [Cheng Yi] sat on a chair, picked up the water bottle on the ground, took a sip, and ran his hand through his hair.
0:4:30|0:4:49|[Cheng Yi] hung up the phone, put the phone in his pocket. He looked towards the door, got up from the chair, and walked towards the door quietly. He pulled aside the thin gauze curtain, peeked outside, listened carefully, then went back to the bedroom to change clothes, and opened the door cautiously.
0:4:49|0:5:1|He first peeked out, noticed the landlord sleeping on the steps, took a breath, silently dug a bit, quickly flashed out of the door, gently closed the iron door with a fierce look on his face, and only breathed a sigh of relief after walking out of the building.
0:5:2|0:5:7|[Cheng Yi] walked on the street, and a man in a suit with his son approached him.
0:7:57|0:7:59|[Cheng Yi] took a sip of wine and put down the glass.
0:9:12|0:9:19|[A Ling] put away the perfume and looked towards [Cheng Yi]. [Cheng Yi] nodded and smiled at her, and she walked up to him with a smile.
0:9:32|0:9:35|[Cheng Yi] shivered next to [A Ling].
0:9:47|0:10:4|[Cheng Yi] called out to [A Ling], who had just turned around, and approached her. [A Ling] smiled somewhat shyly and nodded back to the counter, with [Cheng Yi] looking at her. The scene shifted to outside the Shenzhen High-speed Railway Station, where a bright terrain was being exerted.
0:10:6|0:10:19|[Cheng Yi] walked out of the high-speed rail station with a bag of pan-fried buns on his back, looked around after crossing the road, adjusted his glasses and took a deep breath before continuing to walk. In no time, he arrived at a high-end hotel restaurant where he played the piano on stage.
0:10:38|0:10:44|With the sound of [Cheng Yi]'s qin, a man from Zhongshan Village walked into the hotel with a man wearing sunglasses and a beautiful woman.
0:10:47|0:10:58|At this moment, the men from Zhongshan Villa arrived at the restaurant. With his hands in his pockets, Li Xiaolu glanced over, and A Ling also noticed them. The man from Zhongshan Villa turned to the man in sunglasses and spoke.
0:11:1|0:11:12|The beauty linked arms with the big brother, following [Cheng Yi] up the steps, with two bodyguards behind. The three of them took their seats one after another, and [Li Xiaolu] kept an eye on them.
0:11:40|0:11:47|The big brother is holding the beauty [NIKOLE]. The big brother takes out a gift box.
0:12:31|0:12:51|[NICOLE] walked towards [Cheng Yi] with a flat bag in one hand, swaying her hips. As he climbed the steps, [Cheng Yi] looked at him. At this moment, a group of people rushed into the restaurant, with a long-haired man bowing to the boss. Zhou Biao pointed at the man in a Zhongshan suit.
0:12:58|0:13:1|It seems like they are discussing business, but what illegal activities they are actually up to, only the heavens know.
0:14:13|0:14:21|After speaking, [NICOLE] walked down the steps in high heels, and [Li Xiaolu] watched her return to Zhou Biao's side and sit down, with a smile on her face.
0:14:24|0:14:34|He thought for a moment, let out a sigh, then lowered his head to continue playing the piano. The next day, [Cheng Yi] arrived at the music store, and [Li Xiaolu] put down the instrument she was wiping and greeted him.
0:14:41|0:14:49|[Cheng Yi] heard the sound of the piano and walked towards the piano inside, only to find [NICOLE] playing the piano, his fingers skillfully moving on the keys.
0:14:54|0:14:59|[NICOLE] stood up and stepped aside, listening to the sound of the piano coming from [CHENG YI]'s fingertips.
0:15:37|0:15:45|The two met and shared a smile. [Cheng Yi] watched as [Li Xiaolu] walked away, glanced at the piano, and then looked at the address.
0:16:0|0:16:7|Cars were passing by on the street, [Cheng Yi] was carrying a bag of fruits back to Hong Kong, and coincidentally ran into [A Ling] as she was leaving the house.
0:16:28|0:16:30|[A Ling]'s mother, who is also the landlady, walked out of the building, straightened her clothes, touched her hair, and asked.
0:16:53|0:17:3|Saying that, [Li Xiaolu] took the fruit from [A Ling]'s hand and threw it on the ground. [Lin Zai] hid behind the wall watching all this, only to see a man walking up to [A Ling] and her daughter, then leading [A Ling] into the car.
0:17:10|0:17:31|[Cheng Yi] leaned against the wall, muttering to himself. He bit his lip, walked to the front of the building and slowly swallowed. After hesitating in the air for a moment, he picked up the fruit on the ground, wiped a pear that had fallen outside on his chest, and then put it in the bag. Then he hugged the fruit, watching [A Ling] and her daughter leave in a car.
0:17:31|0:17:36|[Cheng Yi] changed his clothes and arrived at the Purple Gold Flower Square. He picked up his phone and waited.
0:17:41|0:17:43|Li Xiaolu walks towards the sea while waiting.
0:18:24|0:18:26|The big-eyed beauty took the sincere phone call.
0:18:39|0:18:41|Li Xiaolu extends a sincere hand, and the beautiful woman with big eyes turns her head.
0:19:2|0:19:17|The big-eyed beauty dialed the number again, but this time no one answered. Chengyi wanted to say something but stopped. As the big-eyed beauty waited, she glanced sideways at Chengyi, who stood with hands in pockets. Seeing the beauty put down her arms in frustration and sigh, Chengyi squatted down in surprise to pick up the phone.
0:19:29|0:19:44|The beautiful Li Xiaolu with big eyes was about to leave, Lin Zai opened his phone and shook it. Then he arrived at a bar where a dancer was performing on stage. A Ling wiped a glass while saying to Lin Zai at the bar.
0:20:12|0:20:21|Ahui looked up and saw his ex-girlfriend Li Xiaolu walking in with a man. A Ling also noticed him, but lowered her head and looked past him with sincerity.
0:20:25|0:20:35|Chengyi turned his head and clapped his hands, saying, Ahui watched his ex-girlfriend walk away as the dancers danced vigorously to the music.
0:20:57|0:21:9|At this moment, Li Xiaolu, the big-eyed beauty, walked in and casually pushed her glasses up. She looked around and spotted Lin Zai at the bar. Tilting her head, she walked over and patted Lin Zai on the shoulder.
0:21:24|0:21:27|The big-eyed beauty turned around and leaned against the bar.
0:21:46|0:21:50|The prince spoke to the thug. The beautiful woman with big eyes noticed this.
0:21:55|0:21:59|Sincerely looking closely, she rushed to [Li Xiaolu]'s side.
0:22:10|0:22:20|[Li Xiaolu] hugged An and left. When they left, Cheng Yi rushed to [A Ling] and supported him.
0:22:34|0:22:49|Later, [Li Xiaolu] arrived at a villa area according to the address provided by [NICOLE]. Walking up a small slope, he reached the entrance of a villa. He looked inside, checked the address, and then approached to greet. The security guard at the entrance came over and asked.
0:23:7|0:23:11|Li Xiaolu walks along the sincerity and looks at the luxurious villa. The bodyguards stop in front of the glass door. Li Xiaolu pushes the door and walks in, while several bodyguards patrol outside. He takes a look inside the house and sees the grand piano filled with music scores not far from the entrance.
0:23:31|0:23:39|Picking up the sheet music on the piano, [Li Xiaolu] naturally sat down, arranged the sheet music, glanced around the living room, and then began to play the piano absentmindedly.
0:23:51|0:23:54|Li Xiaolu was actually discussing business with the man with long hair in the living room.
0:24:20|0:24:23|The old man walked towards the outside of the house, with [Li Xiaolu] nodding slightly behind them.
0:24:53|0:24:57|The two sat down by the pool, and soon a waiter brought over drinks.
0:25:39|0:25:43|The two walked to the side, and Ruanji patted [Cheng Yi]'s chest.
0:25:57|0:26:18|Ruan Ji turned and walked away, unexpectedly pulling out a gun as he turned around. The bodyguard behind [Cheng Yi] also immediately raised his gun. [Cheng Yi] chuckled, and at this moment, both sides' henchmen were holding guns. [Cheng Yi] grabbed the money bag on the table and left under the cover of the bodyguard. One bodyguard was hit by Ruan Ji and fell into the swimming pool.
0:26:18|0:26:20|[Cheng Yi] looked up at the noise outside.
0:26:52|0:27:5|Outside the house, a fierce battle was raging, and Li Xiaolu's music seemed to have turned into the background music for each person falling down, until several people ran past the glass door, Li Xiaolu stopped playing and stood up. Soon, tables, chairs, and bodyguards were caught up by the soft drinks.
0:27:8|0:27:26|Ruan Jiulian fired several shots, and Zhou Biao had two gunshot wounds on his back. The [Chengyi] alliance hid behind the piano. The glass door was also shattered by Ruan Jiulian. After Zhou Biao fired a few more shots, he still managed to turn around and fire several shots at Ruan Jiulian, but staggered back several steps himself.
0:27:26|0:27:44|[Cheng Yi] furrowed his brows, wanting to see the situation but not daring to expose himself. Finally, Ruan Jiu and Zhou Biao both fell to the ground, the gunshots ceased. Only then did [Cheng Yi] dare to stick his head out, and saw several people already lying outside. Zhou Biao spat out blood, reaching out towards [Cheng Yi] wanting to crawl over.
0:27:44|0:27:51|[Cheng Yi] looked around, made sure no one was there, got up and ran towards the door. He looked around at the door before finally daring to walk out.
0:27:57|0:28:4|He didn't notice him under his feet, and was grabbed by Zhou Biao on the calf. After turning a few times without breaking free, he squatted down to help Zhou Biao.
0:28:27|0:28:42|Zhou Biao handed the money bag to [Cheng Yi], but before he could finish speaking, he collapsed completely. [Cheng Yi] placed one hand on Zhou Biao's shoulder, held the money bag in the other hand, looked around and saw no one, then stood up and ran away with the money bag.
0:28:42|0:28:50|Every now and then, [NICOLE] tried on the wedding dress and returned with the man from Zhongshan Villa, only to see this scene, they hurried over.
0:29:0|0:29:18|Li Xiaolu has already run back to the rental house, leaning against the TV and gasping for breath. Just as he was about to put down the money bag, he walked to the window, took a few breaths while leaning on the piano, turned around and put the money bag on the table, then sat down by himself, using all his strength to lean back for a moment, and he instinctively grabbed the back of the chair with one hand.
0:29:18|0:29:41|Another hand grabbed the money bag, suddenly as if remembering something, moved closer to the chair. He hesitated for a moment, quickly opened the money bag, bundles of money made [Cheng Yi] widen his eyes. He took out a bundle and flipped it over, then reached deep into the money bag, took out a paper bag, and opened it to reveal two DVDs inside.
0:29:41|0:29:50|[Cheng Yi] held the disc in his hand, pondered for a moment, took a few steps back and forth, sighed, then put down the disc and took out his phone from his pocket.
0:30:4|0:30:19|Hanging up the phone, [Cheng Yi] walked into the bedroom, quickly packed up his things, grabbed his backpack and left. Wearing a mask, he arrived at the Kowloon through train station, where pedestrians on the street were also wearing masks. Glancing around, [Cheng Yi] put his hands in his pockets and walked straight into the station.
0:30:19|0:30:25|After a car ride, [Cheng Yi] arrived in front of Guangzhou Zhongqing Square, looking ahead with a bewildered expression on his face.
0:30:33|0:30:42|Chen Yi, with one hand on the strap, looked around in confusion, unaware that inside the office of the Hong Kong Police Station, the police were already having a meeting.
0:30:45|0:30:49|One tycoon is dead and the other is seriously injured. This was captured by the surveillance cameras on site.
0:30:57|0:31:0|He took away a bag of things at the scene of the crime.
0:31:7|0:31:10|He was around 6 o'clock on the day of the incident.
0:32:12|0:32:19|Later, because her father was seriously ill and needed money for treatment, she went out to earn money and met Zhou Biao.
0:32:22|0:32:25|But so far, she is unwilling to say anything about Zhou Biao.
0:33:14|0:33:16|Li Xiaolu is now in the hospital.
0:33:59|0:34:10|You lowered your head and took another puff of smoke before walking slowly. Inside the hospital, Zhou Biao lay on the hospital bed with a ventilator. The police walked over and showed their credentials to the guard.
0:35:1|0:35:13|[NICOLE] rubbed Zhou Biao's hand and touched his forehead. However, Zhou Biao's hand with the needle inserted still showed no response. At this moment, a knocking sound was heard inside the hotel room.
0:35:15|0:35:37|[Cheng Yi] sprang up from the bed, thought for a moment, got up cautiously and walked towards the door. When he opened it, he was met with Zhou Biao glaring at him, holding a knife ready to stab. [Cheng Yi] quickly stepped back and explained. He stood up in panic, breathing heavily.
0:35:43|0:35:52|Later, [Cheng Yi] left the hotel and went to a barbershop, where the barber finally adjusted his hairstyle. He looked at his new hairstyle in the mirror.
0:35:52|0:36:5|The barber removed the cloth, and [Li Xiaolu] stood up and approached the mirror. He ran his hand through his hair a couple of times, took off his old glasses, picked up the new glasses hanging on his collar, put them on, and smiled satisfactorily at his reflection in the mirror.
0:36:9|0:36:25|Leaving the barbershop, [Cheng Yi] walked down the street with a backpack on his back. Under a building, a few young men were loading goods onto a van. [Cheng Yi] noticed the advertisements on the wall and utility poles. He leaned in to take a closer look, then turned to look at the utility pole, and proceeded to tear off a poster and hold it in his hand.
0:36:25|0:36:30|He looked around and found the address on the advertisement, then followed an old lady upstairs.
0:37:5|0:37:9|[Cheng Yi] said to the open door of the mother-in-law. [Cheng Yi] borrowed the key and was about to enter the door, when the door next to it opened and the old man and the beauty poked their heads out.
0:37:55|0:38:11|[Cheng Yi] stood at the door, hesitated for a moment, pursed his lips, and then went inside. At that moment, a car drove into the alley, and four men in suits and sunglasses got out. One of them opened the car door, and [Nicole], dressed beautifully, stepped out of the car, leading the four men to the entrance of the alley.
0:38:11|0:38:22|[NICOLE] stepped out in high heels, carrying a small leather bag in her hand. She wore a camisole jacket over a mesh short-sleeved top, with a necklace shining on her neck. The Zhongshan Villa man walked out with bodyguards to meet her head-on.
0:38:47|0:38:54|Okay, before Biao Ge went to Guam, he talked to the one surnamed Chen, Li Xiaolu, and after thinking about it, Nicole wanted to continue.
0:38:57|0:39:14|The man in Zhongshan Village thought for a moment, looked to the side, gritted his teeth slightly, and nodded. The scene cuts back to the streets of Guangzhou, where Li Xiaolu is walking on a pedestrian overpass with bustling traffic below. There are only a few pedestrians walking on the bridge, and Li Xiaolu walks along one side of the overpass, making a phone call as she walks.
0:39:14|0:39:24|She stood with one hand in her pocket and the other holding a phone, dialing again when no one answered. She stopped in her tracks, switched the phone to the other side, and rested her arm on the railing.
0:40:17|0:40:33|[A Ling] turned to look at her fiancé, who was trying on a suit. [Li Xiaolu] swallowed her tears and saliva, staying silent for a long time. [A Ling] slowly put down her phone and ended the call. After putting down the phone, [Li Xiaolu] bit her lip, took a deep breath, and stared ahead intently.
0:40:34|0:40:53|He walked dejectedly on the narrow sidewalk, with a motorcycle parked on the side and pedestrians passing by on the other side. After a few steps, he felt his phone vibrating, took it out to check, glanced around, and answered the call. After answering, he looked around again, making sure there was no one nearby.
0:41:9|0:41:11|He took off his backpack and sat down on the parked car.
0:41:41|0:41:59|[Cheng Yi] hung up the phone thoughtfully, sighed, and continued walking with a backpack on his back. At this moment, [A Qing] was walking on the street, holding a coat in one hand and stretching his shoulders. Just as he reached a sparsely populated downhill road, two men in suits caught up with him, followed by three others peering out from behind a van on the roadside.
0:41:59|0:42:1|[A Ling] wanted to leave when she sensed danger from the newcomer.
0:42:6|0:42:21|A man in a suit stopped him and pushed him, a few people punched and kicked him, and forced him into the car at gunpoint. [A Ling] was taken to a factory, where his ex-girlfriend [An Jiu] was tied up and hanging, with tape over her mouth.
0:42:32|0:42:34|A man from Zhongshan Village came over playing with a small knife.
0:42:50|0:42:55|Ahui was pushed aside, and [Cheng Yi] approached with a knife in hand, bending down.
0:43:13|0:43:23|The man from Zhongshan Village lightly grazed Li Xiaolu's shoulder with a small knife. Li Xiaolu changed her tone and called out.
0:43:46|0:43:56|It's okay, what will be the consequences. Ahui was startled by the small knife hanging down. At this moment, inside the police station.
0:44:2|0:44:4|And she has never had any contact with any suspicious individuals.
0:44:35|0:44:38|Zhou Biao still had no reaction. [NICOLE] continued speaking.
0:44:50|0:44:53|[NICOLE] was unaware that Zhou Biao's finger twitched slightly.
0:44:59|0:45:4|On the other side, [A Ling] returned to the rental house and passed by the door of the beautiful big-eyed woman, only to find a key inserted in the door.
0:45:41|0:45:46|[A Ling] shrugged and followed him inside. The big-eyed beauty gestured towards the chair.
0:46:6|0:46:8|He finally breathed a sigh of relief.
0:46:35|0:46:42|[Cheng Yi] took the business card ordered by Qin Jialu and left, while Qin Jialu waved at her.
0:47:2|0:47:9|In the tea restaurant during the day, Li Xiaolu was looking at the newspaper, just took a sip of milk tea, when the phone rang, he picked it up and looked at it.
0:47:58|0:48:8|After speaking, he switched hands to hold the phone, took out a pen and wrote down [Cheng Yi]'s address on the newspaper. After putting down the pen, he said to [Cheng Yi] on the other end of the phone.
0:48:11|0:48:27|[Cheng Yi] hung up the phone with a worried look on his face, glanced at the sculpture of the musician Xian Xinhan beside him, sighed and left. In the Disco at night, Qin Jialu was on stage as the DJ.
0:48:32|0:48:47|[Li Xiaolu] walked in and saw the customers dancing on the dance floor. He walked around and glanced at [Li Xiaolu]. She was swaying to the rhythm. When he looked up and saw [Li Xiaolu] smiling at him, he waved back. After that, he found a place to sit down. Not long after.
0:48:51|0:48:53|The waiter placed the drinks and two plates of snacks on the table.
0:48:56|0:49:5|Li Xiaolu touched the wine bottle without drinking, at this moment she took off her earphones, looked at Chengyi who was sitting alone, put the earphones on the table, and walked towards Chengyi.
0:49:44|0:49:54|[Cheng Yi] smiled, watched him walk away, then looked towards the crowd still dancing in the dance floor. He took a sip from the bottle, put it down, crossed his arms in front of his chest, and lowered his head.
0:50:0|0:50:15|Another night, [Cheng Yi] was sleeping in bed, while next door [Li Xiaolu] started playing the guitar. [Cheng Yi] frowned irritably and turned over. After strumming the guitar strings a few times, [Li Xiaolu] wrote something on paper, put down the pen, strummed the guitar again, and stood up with the guitar in hand. He opened his mouth, and [Cheng Yi] covered his ears.
0:50:30|0:50:34|[Cheng Yi] turned over again, while [Li Xiaolu] extended her index finger to find the rhythm. Unable to bear it any longer, [Cheng Yi] sat up and fiercely scratched his head.
0:50:55|0:51:1|[Cheng Yi] rushed out of the room, the knocking interrupted [Li Xiaolu]'s singing, and he opened the door with a piece of paper in his hand.
0:51:52|0:51:57|[Li Xiaolu] looked at the drowsy [Cheng Yi] and smiled, then the camera cut to the police station.
0:52:15|0:52:30|[A Ling] took the piece of paper with the phone number on it. At that moment, [Cheng Yi] was coming down the stairs and ran into [Li Xiaolu]'s grandmother.
0:52:49|0:52:56|Chen Yi helped Grandma [Cheng Yi] to the hospital, but the Qin family was stopped by medical staff in protective clothing at the entrance.
0:53:0|0:53:13|Qin Jialu took the mask from the medical staff and quickly put it on, walking inside. Both medical staff and patients in the hospital were wearing masks, with banners hanging upstairs, saying "Work together to fight against SARS".
0:53:13|0:53:22|Qin Jialu grabbed the bag and searched around, looking for the patient who needed urgent care. When she saw the person brought in for treatment, she rushed forward, only to discover that it was not her grandmother. She took off her mask and headed to the registration desk.
0:53:28|0:53:31|He hurriedly ran in the direction pointed out by the medical staff, but was stopped.
0:54:45|0:54:55|Seeing Qin Jialu pointing at himself and coming up with a plan, [Li Xiaolu] curiously stretched her neck. The next day, Qin Jialu walked out of the door with a big box in his arms, unable to free his hands so he used his foot to hook the door closed.
0:54:55|0:55:1|[NICOLE], who was reading the newspaper, stood up, leaned against the wall with one leg bent, and pushed open the door next door with a flick of her hand.
0:55:4|0:55:10|Qin Jialu reached out and closed the door for him. Downstairs, volunteers were busy. Qin Jialu watched as [Cheng Yi] put the suitcase in the trunk.
0:55:41|0:55:59|Speak up, [Cheng Yi] helped the volunteer to carry a box of water together. After putting it away, the two of them closed the trunk together, and Qinja Road clapped his hands.
0:56:1|0:56:16|Qin Jialu pushed [Cheng Yi] onto the car's shoulder, and a banner with "Love Fills the World" was pasted on the side of the van. After driving for a while, the volunteers in the car counted the number of items.
0:57:41|0:57:52|Qin Jialu and [Cheng Yi] were both a bit embarrassed by the physical contact caused by the shaking. The van made its way to Nancun Primary School, and as soon as the door opened, the students shouted,
0:58:29|0:58:36|The two exchanged a glance, and [Cheng Yi] smiled at Qin Jialu, who was waving to the students. As they walked, [Cheng Yi] asked,
0:58:49|0:58:59|This is set up for children who cannot afford to attend classes. Due to insufficient funds, many teachers also volunteer to help out, and the students' stationery and office supplies are mostly donated by individuals.
0:59:5|0:59:7|Qin Jialu watched as the volunteer workers unloaded the goods.
0:59:31|0:59:33|[Cheng Yi] lowered his head and dared not look at him.
0:59:47|0:59:50|Sincerely hooked the little finger deep in the Qinjialu.
1:0:29|1:0:39|[Cheng Yi] reached out his hand and almost stumbled, but [Lu Lian] quickly caught him. [Lu Lian] supported him as they finally reached the door. [Lu Lian] opened the door.
1:1:10|1:1:30|Qin Jialu sat opposite Chen Yi, showing concern. Qin Jialu got up and walked away, while Chen Yi, witnessed by Lin Zai, sat on the chair where Qin Jialu had just been sitting. He picked up the script on the table and looked at it, while Qin Jialu picked up a medical kit. Chen Yi asked.
1:2:21|1:2:39|Qin Jialu pinched the trouser leg of [Cheng Yi], pointed to the lower leg to confirm, [Cheng Yi] nodded, and then used gauze to wipe it. [Cheng Yi] endured the pain, put down the axe in his hand, and turned his head to the side. Qin Jialu chuckled, [Cheng Yi] winced again, raised one hand to do something, and then withdrew it.
1:2:42|1:2:48|[Li Xiaolu] was trying hard to control herself. In a moment, Qin Jialu opened the door and took out a key in front of [Li Xiaolu].
1:3:1|1:3:6|Li Xiaolu looked at him with a sincere smile, but he leaned in closer, making the atmosphere ambiguous. Li Xiaolu smiled politely.
1:3:16|1:3:32|Li Xiaolu and A Ling locked eyes, approaching each other with sincerity. One hand leaned against the wall. Lin Zai, however, didn't know where to look, glancing down and blinking. Faced with the approaching sincerity, he finally closed his eyes. Just as the two were about to collapse, the sincerity came to a halt.
1:3:32|1:3:36|Qin Jialu opened his eyes and looked at [Cheng Yi] who was bowing his head, picking at his fingers.
1:3:49|1:3:53|Qin Jialu thought for a moment and then grabbed him.
1:4:15|1:4:33|Looking at the closed room door, Li Xiaolu hesitated, leaned against the wall and looked up, sighed, then looked towards the door again. The scene shifts to the hospital, where A Ling puts a bunch of flowers into a vase. She is wearing a cool camisole today, with a neat ponytail, and after casually arranging the flowers, she reaches out to touch Lin Zai's hair.
1:4:48|1:5:4|[NICOLE] stared ahead with a fierce look, as drops of potion dripped from Zhou Biao's bookshelf. At that moment, [CHENG YI] placed the guitar on his lap, leaned on it, and started writing on a piece of paper. After finishing writing, he put down the paper and pen, muttered to himself, and then picked up the guitar. The scene shifted to the overpass.
1:5:13|1:5:15|Ahui is being held by [Cheng Yi].
1:6:2|1:6:10|In this world, the person I trust the most, [Li Xiaolu] leads the way in front. The waiter asks.
1:6:41|1:6:48|[A Ling] pulled [Li Xiaolu] to sit down. The two leaned back on the sofa together.
1:7:24|1:7:28|The two of them had a drink together, and [Lin Zai] put his arm around the girl next to him.
1:7:39|1:7:43|[Cheng Yi] picked up the wine glass, but didn't drink. The lady then picked up some fruit.
1:8:2|1:8:22|[Cheng Yi] took out a roll of money and placed it on the bill. [Cheng Yi] sat down and glanced at the lady. The four of them got up and left, arriving at the D4 nightclub where they worked on Qinjialu Road. [Cheng Yi] embraced the lady and stopped by the dance floor, looking towards the DG stage on Qinjialu Road.
1:9:14|1:9:19|Looking at the intimate couple, [Cheng Yi] was very unhappy, and soon the four of them came out.
1:9:22|1:9:38|Ahui left with two ladies in his arms, and at this moment, Li Xiaolu followed behind, sincerely twisting the rope, and Li Xiaolu walked over.
1:9:40|1:9:42|Seeing that he remained silent, [Cheng Yi] continued to ask.
1:10:2|1:10:11|After speaking, [Li Xiaolu] turned and walked away. [Li Xiaolu] took a step forward, tears in her eyes as she watched him leave. Shortly after they left, the police arrived to investigate the KTV they had just been to.
1:10:42|1:10:48|His good friend A Hui is also worth noting, their appearance always signals the next move.
1:10:53|1:11:6|Sincerity opened the door of [Cheng Yi]'s room, holding a few music scores and a file folder. At this moment, [Cheng Yi] was still in a deep sleep. Sincerity approached his bedside, watching him silently bid farewell in his heart.
1:11:20|1:11:29|He placed the file bag on the bedside table, put the sheet music in a prominent place, pressed it with a water pipe, then glanced at the sleeping [Cheng Yi] before leaving.
1:11:53|1:12:5|[A Ling] and [Lin Zai] exchanged a glance, then turned around and took action. The other police officers also got up and left. Qin Jialu was still asleep, and there was a letter on the table next to the music score, addressed to Miss Qin Jialu.
1:12:5|1:12:19|Qin Jialu sat up and rubbed his eyes. At this time, Li Xiaolu had already arrived at the seaside by car. Li Xiaolu and A Ling got out of the car, while Qin Jialu was drinking water. After finishing the drink, he casually placed the bottle cap on the table. Just as he was about to leave, he noticed a letter on the table.
1:12:19|1:12:34|He picked up the letter and sat on the nearby cave to read it, while [Cheng Yi] and [A Qing] walked together to the dock. The morning light shone on the sea, everything looked very calm. Qin Jialu glanced at the sheet music, then opened the envelope and took out the letter.
1:13:6|1:13:21|Chengyi followed the direction pointed by [A Ling] towards the sea, with two people standing on a speedboat. As the speedboat approached, Chengyi saw that there was a man from Zhongshan Village sitting on it. The man from Zhongshan Village stood up and walked ashore, his expression changed as he looked towards [A Ling].
1:13:26|1:13:29|The man from Zhongshan Village took the backpack that was snatched by [A Ling]. The man's face changed color.
1:13:45|1:14:4|A large group of police officers rushed out of the car, and the men from Zhongshan Village and their henchmen pulled out their handguns and started shooting at them. The police officers quickly dodged, [Cheng Yi] looked towards the police, at this moment, the man from Zhongshan Village turned and aimed at [Cheng Yi]. [Cheng Yi] raised his strong arm, while Lin Zai quickly rushed over and was hit by two shots. The police officers started shooting towards the speedboat.
1:14:4|1:14:8|At this moment, A Hui blocked on the ground following Li Xiaolu's arm, and Li Xiaolu shouted at him to fight.
1:14:17|1:14:26|But his head drooped down. The police chased to the edge of the pier, only to watch the speedboat getting further and further away, with Ah Hui being sincerely held up by the upper body.
1:15:16|1:15:27|[Cheng Yi] finished speaking excitedly, propping his head with his hand. [A Ling] and [A Qing] walked in, the questioning police officer gestured for them to sit down. [Cheng Yi] took a deep breath, and after [A Qing] sat down, she asked,
1:17:24|1:17:26|[A Ling] sat down and said to [Cheng Yi],
1:17:43|1:17:56|[Cheng Yi] turned around and faced [A Ling], who had just stood up, "If I help you find what you're looking for," Cheng Yi also stood up. Cheng Yi sighed, nodded. Qin Jialu followed [A Qin] in, Cheng Yi looked at him, wanting to smile, but couldn't.
1:18:16|1:18:43|Facing the gaze of Qin Jialu, he lowered his head. [A Qin] glanced at the two of them and said to the others. With only themselves and Qin Jialu left in the room, he sincerely spoke up. Qin Jialu pursed his lips and, seeing his sincerity, he spoke.
1:18:58|1:19:11|Chen Yi tugged at the corner of his mouth, and Qin Jialu finally couldn't hold back his emotions, rushing forward to hug Chen Yi, tears falling on his shoulder. Chen Yi hesitated for a moment, but still put his hand on Qin Jialu's shoulder and hugged him.
1:19:14|1:19:19|Returning to her own place, [Cheng Yi] opens the piano cover and takes out the DVD hidden inside.
1:19:31|1:19:35|[A Ling] put away the disc. [Cheng Yi] thought for a moment, shook his head, and [A Ling] analyzed.
1:19:50|1:19:58|Thinking for a moment, Li Xiaolu turned around and contacted [NICOLE], and the two met at an outdoor café.
1:20:0|1:20:5|Li Xiaolu noticed the necklace around her neck and continued speaking.
1:20:23|1:20:27|At this moment, [A Ling] in the car nodded towards [Li Xiaolu] who was listening in.
1:21:13|1:21:29|After speaking, [Nico] stood up and walked over to [Chengyi]. [Chengyi] stood up and looked at him, then glanced at the police, following [Nico] as they left. They walked past a pedestrian bridge, and after a few steps, several men followed them, keeping a distance of two meters.
1:21:29|1:21:36|After a few steps, [Nico] became alert, squinted his eyes, slightly turned his head, and quietly reminded Chengyi.
1:21:41|1:21:51|The two sped up their pace, with two men still closely following behind. Suddenly, Li Xiaolu and Lin Zai started running, the two men chasing after them relentlessly. Inside the car, A Ling picked up the walkie-talkie.
1:21:57|1:22:3|Reaching a corner, [Li Xiaolu] earnestly grabbed [NICOLE]'s arm, indicating her to split up. The two then ran in different directions.
1:22:3|1:22:20|The two men looked at each other and chased towards [Cheng Yi]. [Cheng Yi] ran into a dead end, watching them approach on the steps. [Cheng Yi] had no choice but to charge forward, but unfortunately his fists were no match for their four hands. Luckily, the police arrived just in time.
1:22:27|1:22:33|They are henchmen of the Ruan gang from Thailand who have come specifically to seek revenge on [Nick] and Zhou Biao.
1:23:11|1:23:14|[NICOLE] brought [CHENG YI] to the table and chairs, and greeted them.
1:23:17|1:23:22|Seeing him looking around and sitting down, [NICOLE] played with her hair, while [程翼] took out a DVD.
1:23:25|1:23:29|[Nicole] leaned towards the chair next to her and took the DVD to have a look.
1:24:15|1:24:20|[Nicole] pulled out a chair and sat down, while [Cheng Yi] stood up and walked to her side, pointing the gun at himself.
1:24:59|1:25:5|Li Xiaolu, A Ling, and Lin Zai, along with a large group of henchmen, arrived at the bowling alley. Nico stopped in his tracks and turned around.
1:25:17|1:25:36|Nicole lowered her head and touched the necklace, then looked up at the man from Zhongshan Villa. The man nodded and then glanced towards [Cheng Yi]. Cheng Yi turned his head away and didn't look at him. Nicole walked alone to a row of cabinets, stopped at a cabinet he knew, and looked back behind him.
1:25:36|1:25:45|After making sure no one was around, [Li Xiaolu] twisted the password and opened the cabinet, revealing a safe inside. She first inserted the key, then looked down at the necklace around her neck, and turned the combination lock.
1:25:46|1:25:58|Repeating several times, she turned the necklace on her neck to complete the password. Twisting the key, she indeed opened the safe. Seeing the briefcase inside, she smiled, looked around, and closed the safe.
1:25:58|1:26:10|Nico placed the safe on the table and opened it, inside were forgotten money and a disc. She took out the disc and smiled. Li Xiaolu and the man from Zhongshan Villa looked at her, she raised her head and said.
1:26:15|1:26:31|[Cheng Yi] looked at the man from Zhongshan Villa, who also looked back at him. [NICOLE] picked up the suitcase and stood up to leave, her men followed suit and walked towards the door. Unexpectedly, as they just stepped down the stairs, one of the men in front noticed the police ahead and turned around to speak.
1:26:35|1:26:42|Two henchmen are pulling [Cheng Yi] while the men from Zhongshan Villa and one henchman are running in the opposite direction with [NICOLE].
1:26:46|1:26:54|The man from Zhongshan Villa pulled out a gun, but the police had already surrounded them, with [Cheng Yi] hiding under the table.
1:27:2|1:27:12|[NICOLE] held a suitcase and looked around at the men from Zhongshan Villa, then closed the door and fired a shot to the side. Gunshots rang out, and [CHENG YI] quickly covered his head with his arm.
1:27:12|1:27:25|The man from Zhongshan Village protected [NICOLE], got shot and fell to the ground. Seeing this, [NICOLE] took out a gun from the suitcase and pointed it at [CHENG YI].
1:27:30|1:27:35|[NICOLE] watched as the police approached.
1:27:55|1:28:3|Chengyi took the opportunity to turn around and grab [NICOLE], but was hit in the thigh. Chengyi was left with lingering fear.
1:28:14|1:28:30|The scene shifts to Nancun Elementary School, [Cheng Yi] limps to the entrance, glances at the school sign, and walks towards the main gate. Leaning against the door, he watches the students on the playground, pushes the door open, and steps inside. Everything is still so familiar, and [Cheng Yi] smiles.
1:28:30|1:28:36|Next, [Cheng Yi] slowly walked towards the playground, with Qin Jialu facing away from him, calling the students to gather around.
1:29:11|1:29:24|Qin Jialu seemed to feel the gaze of [Cheng Yi], turned his head and saw it was [Cheng Yi]. [Cheng Yi] smiled at him, he ran over and smiled back, the two of them looked at each other like this, and soon embraced each other.
