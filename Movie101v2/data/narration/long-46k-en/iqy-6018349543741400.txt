0:0:37|0:0:55|The film begins with a group of adorable puppies eagerly nursing from their mother. They are Labrador retriever puppies. Labrador retrievers are one of the smartest dogs in the world. As the puppies grow, they line up in a row and happily eat the dog food from their own bowls.
0:0:56|0:1:11|In the row of puppies on the far right, our protagonist, [Chen Qi], stands out. He wears a red collar and has a gray seagull-shaped birthmark on his belly. Clearly, [Chen Qi] is still very unfamiliar with the world, as he enjoys running around the house and looking around.
0:1:11|0:1:19|He ran to the window, looked through the glass, and saw Mr. Li Baoting and his sister Li Baoer walking towards the door.
0:1:20|0:1:27|[Li Baoting] was still holding a cake in his hands, and Chen Qi looked puzzled. The hostess Jessica opened the door, and the two greeted each other warmly.
0:1:32|0:1:35|Male protagonist Ryan also warmly welcomed them.
0:2:10|0:2:16|Ryan took everyone to the garden outside and opened the cake box, revealing a delicate cream cake inside.
0:2:34|0:2:45|Ran signaled to [Li Baoer] to calm down Mr. [Li Baoting]. Little Q ran to the second-floor balcony and, through the gaps in the railing, saw Mr. [Li Baoting] and his sister sitting on the sofa in the garden.
0:2:47|0:3:1|[Li Baoting] took the red wine bottle, his right hand trembling slightly as he held it. Not long ago, his vision started to deteriorate, only able to see blurry lights. Pouring himself a glass of wine, he then struggled to pour some into his sister's glass.
0:3:6|0:3:15|Next, he raised his glass. Unable to see clearly, [Li Baoting] accidentally knocked over his own glass, spilling red wine onto his pants.
0:3:33|0:3:56|Little Q was watching on the balcony and trying to squeeze through the gap in the railing. Suddenly, he fell out of the gap and landed in the arms of [Li Baoting], who held him tightly. [Li Baoting] was indifferent and moved forward. Little Q looked at him with a look of innocence.
0:4:6|0:4:29|A car pulls up in front of Run's house, with "International Guide Dog Association" written on it. [Simon] and Bishan get out of the car. Inside the house, the puppies have made a mess, and Jessica is carefully looking after them, but facing so many mischievous little dogs.
0:4:33|0:4:36|Chen Qi ran out, followed by Simon and Luliao Bishan entering with Ryan.
0:4:42|0:4:47|[Simon] and [Luliao Bishan] pick up one small dog after another and put them into cages.
0:4:54|0:4:58|Little Q was still playing with the ball under the table when he was picked up by [Simon].
0:5:8|0:5:25|[Ryan] and [Jessica] watched, feeling a bit reluctant. Little Q was locked in a cage and would be going to the guide dog association with his companions for training. The scene shifted to the guide dog association holding a ceremony for guide dog foster families.
0:6:3|0:6:16|The little girl kissed Little Q, who happily licked her face. Little Q followed [Chen Zhiqiao]'s family to her new home. She then carried Little Q into the bedroom.
0:6:51|0:6:55|A teddy bear dog came down from upstairs and ran to [Chen Zhiqiao]'s side.
0:7:2|0:7:8|[Li Baoer] friendly licks [Ma Dongmei]. At night, only looking at [Li Baoer] crouching in the dog's nest.
0:7:16|0:7:29|At night, [Chen Qi] was lying in his own den. [Master] was called away by [Chen Zhiqiao].
0:7:34|0:7:43|Before long, [Chen Zhiqiao] emerged from the bedroom again. He was holding a glowing crystal ball in his hand. He placed the crystal ball next to [Chen Qi].
0:7:51|0:8:15|Under the warm light of the starry lamp, [Li Baoer] fell asleep quietly. From then on, [Li Baoer] and [Chen Zhiqiao] became inseparable good companions, doing everything together. [Li Baoting] and Li Baoer took a nap together on the bed.
0:8:17|0:8:43|[Li Baoting] was reading a book, with Xiao Q and Dong Gu accompanying him. They often played in the garden. The bubbles blown by [Li Baoting] emitted colorful light under the sun, falling around Xiao Q little by little. One day when it rained, [Li Baoting], along with his friends and Xiao Q, took shelter under a rock.
0:8:51|0:9:10|In the heavy rain, the children happily swing on the swings, with Li Baoer also sitting on the swing. They climb up the slide together and slide down quickly. They turn around and return home, with Chen Kangyaner giving Li Baoer an injection, causing him to shiver with his eyes closed.
0:9:42|0:10:6|At night, the lights went out. [Li Baoer] came to Little Q's nest with her pillow and blanket. She placed the pillow on the ground, covered the blanket, and fell asleep with [Little Q] in the dog's nest. The scene shifted to the International Guide Dog Association, where [Simon] met [Luliao Bishan] and [Little Q] again.
0:10:12|0:10:22|The door opens, and many Labrador Retrievers are led into the training hall. [Chen Qi] sees his former brothers and sisters, rushes over, extremely happy, and the dogs start wrestling together.
0:10:31|0:10:47|The trainers have dog food pouches tied around their waists. [Simon] and [Bishan] demonstrate to everyone how to teach dogs to sit, stand up, stay still, and other actions. [Mrs. Chen] is training [Little Qi], who learns quickly and always receives some dog food as a reward.
0:10:50|0:11:18|Back at home, [Luliao Bishan] also prepared a pile of rewards for the dogs. Upon hearing the command, the little dogs obediently lay down on the ground. However, at home, [Luliao Bishan] started reverse training [Chen Qi].
0:11:19|0:11:32|Little Q, who should have been lying down, stood up upon hearing the command and walked towards [Simon]. [Simon] demonstrated how to teach the dog to climb stairs. After watching the demonstration, [Chen Kangyaner] successfully led Little Q up a flight of stairs.
0:11:35|0:11:48|At home, [Chen Zhiqiao] continues the reverse training for Little Q. On the stairs where one should pay attention to stepping down, [Chen Zhiqiao] keeps shouting to move forward.
0:11:48|0:11:58|In the training hall, the dogs are practicing navigating obstacles. When they encounter obstacles, they lead their owners around them. However, [Chen Zhiqiao] is training little Q to jump over obstacles directly.
0:12:2|0:12:7|At night, he only looked out the window and stuck three pencils into the sand.
0:12:28|0:12:37|Finally, it's the day of the first stage assessment for the guide dogs. In the hall, the assessors from the United States are leading a Labrador through obstacle courses and testing its focus.
0:12:59|0:13:1|Simon walked up to Chen Kangyaner and Chen Qi.
0:13:10|0:13:22|[Chen Qi] was fitted with a blindfold and started the test under the guidance of the examiner. She smoothly maneuvered around the obstacles, with pigeons nearby and kites swaying in the air having no effect on her.
0:13:25|0:13:39|He continued to move forward with full concentration, only glancing nervously at Chen Kangyaner. Even the delicious bones and the dog next to her, Little Q passed by them without looking back.
0:13:43|0:13:57|Seeing how well Li Baoer did, some were anxious. If Li Baoer passed, she would be taken away. However, Li Baoer successfully resisted all temptations and completed the test smoothly.
0:14:8|0:14:15|[Chen Zhiqiao] was a bit hard to accept, tears welling up in her eyes. Soon, [Simon] arrived at [Chen Zhiqiao]'s home to take Little Q away for training.
0:15:5|0:15:25|Xiao Q pushed the star lamp in front of [Chen Zhiqiao], gently patting his hand with his paw as if comforting [Chen Zhiqiao]. [Chen Zhiqiao] lit up the star lamp and hugged Xiao Q tightly.
0:15:38|0:15:49|[Chen Kangyaner] was also a little sad outside the door. The door opened, and the two of them pushed it open and entered. [Simon] squatted in front of the paper bridge, and [Chen Kangyaner] hugged him.
0:16:28|0:16:34|Li Baoting lovingly licked Chen Zhiqiao's face, just like they did the first time they met.
0:16:36|0:16:42|Chen Kangyaner and Donggu bid farewell to Little Q as Simon carries him into the car.
0:16:57|0:17:16|On the second-floor balcony, Li Baoting looked sadly at the car carrying Chen Zhiqiao as it gradually drove away. Suddenly, he thought of something, turned around, and ran downstairs. The car turned a corner and left the yard, with Li Baoting chasing after it while holding a box.
0:17:27|0:17:40|Only stumbled accidentally, the box fell to the ground, and the toys rolled onto the road. Just as [Chen Kangyaner] was about to get up and chase after them, she was stopped by [Chen Kangyaner]. Watching Little Q getting further and further away, Just felt extremely sad.
0:17:48|0:17:58|The scene changes, the guide dog association's car stops in front of Li Baoting's house, Simon and Luliao Bishan get out of the car, and Chen Zhiqiao is sitting inside the back door.
0:18:51|0:18:58|[Li Baoting] sat on the sofa in the distance, indifferent, without even turning his head.
0:19:5|0:19:7|[Li Baoer] walks towards [Li Baoting].
0:19:47|0:19:54|Everyone couldn't help but feel a little worried after hearing that, but they were also powerless. [Li Baoting] sat back on the sofa, and Chen Qi looked very puzzled.
0:20:24|0:20:28|Simon is still very worried about Li Baoting and Chen Qi, with a worried look on his face.
0:20:38|0:20:41|When everyone had left, [Simon] said.
0:21:22|0:21:28|[Li Baoer] looked at [Li Baoting], then at Chen Qi. He didn't know how [Li Baoting] would get along with Chen Qi.
0:21:36|0:21:55|Dusk falls, [Li Baoting] sits on the ground, drinking red wine alone. Since losing his sight, he has been lonely and melancholic every day. Little Q stands up from the cushion beside him and walks around the room, getting familiar with this unfamiliar new environment. This way, he can better assist [Li Baoting] in his daily life.
0:22:2|0:22:20|He turned his head to look at the photo on the cabinet of Li Baoting and Li Baoer, as well as the trophy Li Baoting won in the chef competition. On the far right is a photo of Li Baoting learning cooking with Master and his brothers.
0:22:20|0:22:29|Xiao Q looked at [Li Baoting] beside him, who remained motionless, filled with sadness and despair. And so, the sky gradually darkened.
0:22:38|0:22:48|He got up and fumbled to turn on all the lights in the room. Then, he turned on the TV.
0:22:51|0:22:56|With the sound of the TV in the background, Li Baoting heats up his meal and fumbles his way to the dining table.
0:23:7|0:23:15|On the TV, the program video that Li Baoting participated in before losing his sight is playing. In the program, Li Baoting tasted the dish in front of him.
0:23:57|0:24:10|Li Baoting walked behind [Chen Qi], startling him. Chen Qi walked away dejectedly and returned to his cushion to sit down. That was how Li Baoting and Chen Qi had no interaction.
0:24:22|0:24:33|The next day, the phone rang. [Li Baoting] fumbled to answer the phone.
0:25:23|0:25:27|[Li Baoting] angrily hung up the phone and slammed the mobile on the table.
0:25:36|0:26:10|The corkscrew on the coffee table was knocked to the ground. He bent down to search around but couldn't find it. He sat up helplessly. Little Q, sitting on a cushion in the distance, saw it and quickly walked over to pick up the corkscrew, handing it to [Li Baoting]. [Li Baoting] angrily overturned the table and drove Little Q away.
0:26:10|0:26:13|He slowly got up and sat back on the sofa, calling out to [Chen Qi].
0:26:21|0:26:35|Li Baoting grabbed Little Q by the collar as soon as he approached, and Little Q struggled desperately, crying out in pain. Li Baoting staggered as he dragged Little Q down the stairs.
0:26:38|0:27:4|Li Baoting finally got thrown onto the street. The bar owner next to the building saw Li Baoting slam the door shut. Li Baoting obediently sat down at the entrance of the building, waiting for his owner to come and take him home. At night, a heavy rain started pouring down.
0:27:10|0:27:32|[Li Baoting] was drinking alone in the bedroom, still not bringing Xiao Q home. He was pondering something and eventually turned off the bedroom light.
0:27:47|0:28:2|Downstairs, Li Qi hasn't gone anywhere. He's at the entrance of the apartment building, taking shelter from the rain under a van. He looks extremely helpless.
0:28:21|0:28:40|The bar owner turned off the lights and saw Li Baoting under the van. Upstairs, the lights in Li Baoting's house flickered on and off. Little Q looked up hopefully at the lights, wishing he could take her home.
0:28:42|0:28:52|The next day was sunny, the sun was shining brightly, and someone rang the doorbell of Li Baoting's house. Li Baoting opened the door, and Chen Qi ran in, followed by the Bar Owner.
0:29:10|0:29:12|[Li Baoting] was filled with mixed emotions. He filled [Chen Qi]'s bowl with dog food.
0:29:36|0:29:46|[Li Baoting] stood up, turned around and left. [Chen Qi] stood up wanting to go after him, but only saw [Li Baoting] reaching the door, finding his cane, and leaving alone.
0:30:3|0:30:18|Little Q returned to the cushion and faced a bowl of dog food, but he had no appetite and refused to eat a single bite. The next day, [Li Baoer] came to [Li Baoting]'s house and started tidying up the messy living room.
0:30:28|0:30:31|Li Qi ran excitedly to the door, opened it, and it was Door C.
0:30:39|0:30:43|Simon saw the messy living room.
0:30:48|0:30:51|Simon noticed that the dog leash around Little Q's neck was not untied.
0:31:55|0:32:3|The scene shifts, with Li Baoting leading Little Q on the sidewalk. Behind them, Simon follows cautiously.
0:32:8|0:32:12|[Li Baoting] appeared to be a bit nervous. He walked to the edge of the steps.
0:32:16|0:32:18|[Li Baoting] tested the waters with his foot.
0:32:23|0:32:32|Xiao Q heard the command and continued forward. Soon, Li Baoting saw a stalled motorcycle in front of him, and Xiao Q stopped again.
0:32:39|0:32:42|[Li Baoting] touches the edge of the motorcycle.
0:32:48|0:32:54|Forward, [Li Baoting] kicked the dog leash, and Xiao Q led him to the road, bypassing the motorcycles, and continued forward.
0:33:10|0:33:30|At the intersection, waiting for the traffic light to turn green, Xiao Q led Li Baoting across the zebra crossing. At the restaurant entrance, Li Baoer ran towards them.
0:34:0|0:34:7|In the corner of the restaurant lies a cushion. Chen Qi runs over and keeps embroidering on the cushion.
0:34:16|0:34:24|On the second floor of the restaurant, Li Baoting tasted the desserts made by his apprentices, while the others waited nervously for his evaluation. He angrily set down the spoon.
0:35:14|0:35:35|On the other side, [Simon] took Little Q out to the restroom. Little Q hasn't been to the restroom for a long time. After work, [Simon] followed Li Baoting, who was holding Little Q.
0:36:45|0:36:49|At night at home, Li Baoting tasted the pudding he made himself and was very dissatisfied after taking two bites.
0:37:17|0:37:40|He angrily threw the pudding and plates into the trash can. Taking off his apron, he walked to the table and accidentally knocked over the guide cane on the table. Xiao Q saw Li Baoting bend down to pick up the guide cane, thinking Li Baoting wanted to go out, so he quickly ran over.
0:37:45|0:37:51|The scene shifts, [Li Baoting] takes Little Q to the restroom in the park.
0:38:15|0:38:25|Later, [Li Baoting] and Chen Qi sat down on a bench under a big tree. [Li Baoting] felt his way to sit down, while Chen Qi lay down beside him.
0:38:45|0:39:7|[Li Baoting] made Xiao Q stand up, loosened the leash around his neck, and removed the guide saddle. Xiao Q looked at him in confusion.
0:39:28|0:39:42|Li Baoting quickly ran towards the distance. He took out his cane from his pocket and felt his way back home.
0:39:56|0:40:1|Xiao Q ran from a distance and followed behind [Li Baoting], silently protecting him.
0:40:8|0:40:32|[Li Baoting] noticed the little Q next to him, paused for a moment, looked down at him, and then they continued walking forward. The scene shifted, and a long line had formed outside [Li Baoting]'s restaurant.
0:40:43|0:40:50|In the kitchen upstairs, Li Baoting's apprentices are busy making desserts. Li Baoting sits aside, listening to everything.
0:41:16|0:41:22|[Li Baoting] came out with Little Q. While waiting for the green light at the intersection, [Li Baoting] remembered what [Li Baoer] had said to him.
0:41:42|0:41:55|The green light was on, but [Li Baoting] changed his route and turned right. [Simon] followed him silently not far behind.
0:41:57|0:42:13|The group was puzzled, not knowing where [Li Baoting] was going. [Li Baoting] stopped by the roadside, with vehicles passing by in front of him, recalling his experiences after falling ill.
0:42:52|0:43:16|Despair accumulated in his heart, losing his sight made his life meaningless. He took a deep breath and slowly walked towards the middle of the road. Chen Zhiqiao worriedly called out, and Simon also ran towards Li Baoting. Cars on the road swerved to avoid hitting Li Baoting, creating a chaotic scene.
0:43:29|0:43:50|A white car abruptly stopped in front of him, but the black car behind crashed into the rear of the white car, pushing it towards Mr. [Li Baoting]. Mr. [Li Baoting] stood still and smiled bitterly. At this critical moment, Chen Qi ran towards Mr. [Li Baoting]. He quickly pushed Mr. [Li Baoting] away.
0:43:50|0:43:54|Mr. Li Baoting fell to the ground and narrowly escaped this disaster. Simon also arrived just in time.
0:44:25|0:44:35|Mr. Li Baoting's eyes were filled with tears, and Li Baoer lay beside him, with his head close to Mr. Li Baoting's hand, afraid that he would hurt himself.
0:44:35|0:44:44|In the guide dog association meeting hall, everyone is evaluating the pairing result of Mr. [Li Baoting] and Little Q. Mr. [Li Baoting] is waiting outside the room, accompanied by the trainer and Little Q.
0:45:43|0:45:46|Outside the conference hall, Mr. [Li Baoting] spoke to the instructor.
0:45:54|0:45:58|Little Q ran towards Mr. [Li Baoting], and Mr. [Li Baoting] affectionately stroked him.
0:46:14|0:46:22|[Li Baoting] gently kisses Xiao Q. As the meeting ends, [Simon] calls Xiao Q over to him.
0:46:34|0:46:37|Li Baoting is feeling lost.
0:46:43|0:47:12|He took out his white cane and walked towards the door alone. Little Q saw it and ran over, blocking [Li Baoting] from leaving. The scene shifted, [Li Baoting] led Little Q out of the association's gate. Their relationship moved the instructors, and they finally agreed to their pairing.
0:47:16|0:47:27|[Li Baoting] smiled happily. He picked up the guide cane and trustingly let Chen Zhiqiao lead him home.
0:47:33|0:47:58|As usual, when going down the stairs, Little Q would stop and guide [Li Baoting] step by step safely down the stairs. Since then, [Li Baoting] has also become more cheerful, stopping to buy flowers on the way to work. He would unconsciously smile while walking.
0:48:5|0:48:27|He would buy snacks for [Chen Qi], play games with [Chen Qi], and even allow [Chen Qi] to play with his desk lamp in his bedroom.
0:48:38|0:49:3|While tasting his disciple's dessert, he also put away his sharpness. Because of Xiao Q, Li Baoting's life gradually became happy and joyful. He also enjoys taking Xiao Q to the park. While Xiao Q plays with the children, he sits on a bench in the park listening to music.
0:49:13|0:49:20|Upon hearing Li Baoting's call, Chen Qi quickly ran to Li Baoting's side.
0:49:26|0:49:52|In the distance, a group of children playing baseball happily head home. Their baseball rolls to the side of Chen Qi, who picks it up joyfully and hands it to Li Baoting. As the children search for the ball, they walk towards Mr. Li Baoting.
0:49:52|0:49:58|Mr. Li Baoting secretly put the ball into his pocket, the children walked away, Mr. Li Baoting took out the baseball and handed it to Chen Qi.
0:50:21|0:50:26|A few days later, Mr. [Li Baoting] and his martial brothers went to Master's house in Guangzhou. The car stopped at a service area.
0:50:56|0:51:15|Only Mr. [Li Baoting] and Chen Qi are left in the car. Mr. [Li Baoting] also gets out of the car to get some fresh air. Two young people pass by, seeing Chen Qi and the blind Mr. [Li Baoting], and exchange glances.
0:51:21|0:51:37|Brothers, [Li Baoting] stopped by a white unlicensed car as they walked back. A stick for catching dogs was extended from the car to pull Little Q into it, then quickly drove away. Mr. [Li Baoting] fell to the ground when he tried to chase after them, and Little Q...
0:51:45|0:51:59|A white van drives into a factory, filled with stolen dogs. The dog thief gets out of the car, and little Q, locked in a cage, is taken off the vehicle.
0:52:53|0:52:55|Several fierce dog traffickers are smashing the car door.
0:53:23|0:53:26|[Li Baoting] opened the car door and rushed out, engaging in a scuffle with several people.
0:53:32|0:53:40|[Li Baoting] was supported by his junior brother as they walked towards Guan Gou's factory. Xiao Q also saw him and desperately clung to the cage.
0:53:50|0:54:15|Suddenly, Li Baoting heard Little Q's cry and quickly rushed towards the direction of the sound. The dog traffickers were holding wooden sticks and steel pipes as they chased into the factory. The scene was chaotic, with cages overturned on the ground. The dog trafficker locked Li Baoting's neck, while his junior brothers were fighting with others.
0:54:21|0:54:35|While Li Baoting was trying hard to listen to Xiao Q's voice, he was kicked down to the ground. The dog trafficker ruthlessly beat him, but he ignored the pain and crawled forward resolutely. And in front of Li Baoting was Xiao Q.
0:54:47|0:54:59|At this moment, the police arrived in time and arrested all the dog traffickers. The junior brother helped up [Li Baoting].
0:55:2|0:55:8|The door of the cage was knocked open, and Xiao Q broke through the cage and ran towards Mr. Li Baoting, who hugged Xiao Q tightly.
0:55:16|0:55:30|The scene shifts, and several people arrive at Master's house. Mr. Li Baoting is wiping Chen Zhiqiao's body. Master is supported into the courtyard and sees Mr. Li Baoting.
0:56:11|0:56:28|Returning from Guangzhou, Mr. [Li Baoting], Xiao Q, [Li Baoer] and their disciples took a boat to an island for sightseeing. On the boat, Mr. [Li Baoting] held Xiao Q and played with her, while the island had beautiful scenery.
0:57:1|0:57:11|[Li Baoting] threw the baseball forward, and Chen Zhiqiao ran over, leaping into the air to catch the ball. Li Baoer looked on, feeling a bit worried. Mr. Li then threw the ball that Chen Zhiqiao caught far away.
0:57:29|0:57:31|Mr. Li Baoting is going to have a running competition with everyone.
0:57:44|0:57:58|Under the leadership of Xiao Q, Mr. [Li Baoting] ran forward confidently, without worrying about any danger. At this moment, he felt extremely happy.
0:58:12|0:58:34|Mr. Li Baoting couldn't run anymore, he lay on the grass, and Little Q ran over to play with him. Beside the vending machine, Little Q ordered a bottle of Sprite for Li Baoting, who took a sip and found something wrong.
0:58:39|0:59:3|Little Q suddenly stopped and looked into the distance, wanting to walk forward. It turned out that in the distance was [Chen Zhiqiao], who had grown much taller, looking at Little Q with a happy smile.
0:59:7|0:59:34|This joyful playfulness has become a norm, and the [Li Baoting] family often takes little Q to the island for fun. Little Q runs freely in the sunlight, playing for a while before running back to [Li Baoting] to check on him. [Li Baoting] enjoys watching his disciples play games with little Q, and he becomes more and more cheerful. He patiently teaches his disciples how to make desserts.
0:59:40|1:0:5|With the help of his apprentices, he also started making exquisite and delicious desserts. [Li Baoting] even wrote a book about himself and Little Q, called "Island, Ordinary".
1:0:12|1:0:23|This book is very popular, [Li Baoting] is invited to take a plane to various bookstores for interviews, and his life becomes more enriched.
1:0:31|1:0:47|During the interview, Little Q obediently lay at the feet of [Li Baoting]. As time passed, [Li Baoting] and Little Q became inseparable and intimate.
1:0:59|1:1:6|They went to the bustling city and to the tranquil riverside.
1:1:19|1:1:23|On the plane ride home, the flight attendant said to [Li Baoting].
1:1:35|1:1:38|[Li Baoting] takes out an apple from his pocket.
1:1:46|1:2:14|Li Baoting lay exhausted next to Xiao Q, looking much older. The plane landed, and Li Baoting touched Xiao Q's bowl, only to find that Xiao Q hadn't eaten any of the apples. Back home, Xiao Q often collapsed on the mat, listless.
1:2:19|1:2:25|Little Q is already eight years old, and his sister is ready to retire.
1:2:50|1:3:4|But in reality, Xiao Q was already very exhausted. At night, [Li Baoting] took Xiao Q camping on the grass.
1:3:37|1:3:50|In the sky, the stars are twinkling. [Li Baoting] lovingly caresses little Q beside him. Everything is still the same, [Li Baoting] and little Q go downstairs and greet the [Bar Owner].
1:3:58|1:4:32|[Li Baoting] took a few steps forward and suddenly felt uncomfortable. He stopped for a moment, then continued forward. But after a few steps, he slowed down, clutching his chest, and fell to the ground. Chen Qi immediately noticed something was wrong and anxiously pushed [Li Baoting].
1:4:42|1:5:8|Seeing no response from him, clever [Chen Qi] suddenly ran back. [Chen Qi] gestured for him to look to the left, and he saw [Li Baoting] lying on the ground. The scene shifted to [Li Baoting] lying pale-faced on a hospital bed, with [Li Baoer] by his side.
1:5:12|1:5:18|Simon took Li Baoer away, asking her to get in the car, but she refused.
1:5:32|1:5:36|Simon squatted down, with Chen Zhiqiao crouching by his feet.
1:5:41|1:5:57|[Simon] looks towards the window of Li Baoting's hospital room in the building. In the hospital corridor, the doctor is explaining Mr. Li Baoting's condition to [Li Baoer]. [Li Baoer] looks worried.
1:6:6|1:6:14|In the hospital room, Mr. [Li Baoting] woke up and heard Little Q calling outside the window. He hurriedly got up and moved slowly to the window.
1:6:32|1:6:42|Downstairs, [Chen Qi] saw Mr. [Li Baoting] through the window and howled, refusing to leave. At night, Mr. [Li Baoting] held Chen Qi.
1:7:49|1:7:55|The scene changes, the driver loads the luggage onto the car, it's time to say goodbye.
1:8:8|1:8:17|Little Q threw herself onto Mr. [Li Baoting], bidding a tearful farewell. She looked at Mr. [Li Baoting] sorrowfully, tears filling her eyes.
1:8:26|1:8:31|Mr. Li Baoting untied his dog leash, took out a baseball from his pocket, which was Little Q's favorite. Mr. Li Baoting threw the baseball with all his strength, and Little Q obediently ran off into the distance to fetch the ball.
1:8:50|1:9:15|[Li Baoting] listened to the sound of Xiao Q running, his expression filled with reluctance. Xiao Q picked up the ball and saw that [Li Baoting] had already left by car. He ran desperately in the direction the car was leaving, ignoring any obstacles. It seemed like he had exerted all his strength, closely following the van as it drove away.
1:9:19|1:9:35|[Li Baoting] remained silent, his expression filled with sadness and reluctance. Chen Qi cleverly chose a shortcut and drove alongside [Li Baoting]'s car.
1:9:42|1:9:48|Turning at the intersection, his car was so close to Li Baoting's car that another car suddenly rushed out from the side, almost hitting him.
1:10:34|1:10:39|[Li Baoting] didn't mind, kept turning his head back, looking at little Q running behind the car with a heartache.
1:10:55|1:11:15|Li Qi was already exhausted, but he refused to stop chasing. He followed all the way up to the overpass. He was about to catch up with the car almost immediately.
1:11:20|1:11:27|But found a huge protective net in front of him, unable to run over.
1:11:34|1:11:42|[Li Baoer] turned her head, tears sliding down her cheeks. She tried hard to control her emotions, not letting [Li Baoting] notice.
1:11:52|1:12:14|Little Q, blocked by the protective net, kept whimpering and spinning around, eventually sitting on the ground exhausted and despondent. Inside the Guide Dog Association, [Chen Zhiqiao] patiently waited, and when she saw Simon leading Little Q out, she joyfully stood up.
1:12:30|1:12:34|Xiao Q recognized Zhiqiao, just like Xiangyu, she gently licked Zhiqiao's face.
1:12:42|1:12:56|Little Q returned to the original home again, excitedly familiarizing himself with the environment. He ran from the garden into the house, saw Mrs. Chen, Mr. Chen, and [Chen Zhiqiao] who was making the bed for him.
1:13:12|1:13:23|Later, he ran to the cabinet under the TV and tried to open the cabinet door. At this moment, [Chen Kangyaner] walked over.
1:13:28|1:13:32|[Chen Kangyaner] opens the cabinet door, revealing the starlight lamp inside.
1:13:41|1:13:44|Mrs. Chen called Little Q over.
1:14:19|1:14:22|At night, [Chen Zhiqiao] took out all of Little Q's toys.
1:15:13|1:15:22|Later, Li Qi and [Chen Zhiqiao] started living together again. In the morning, she would jump on [Chen Zhiqiao]'s bed to wake him up.
1:15:29|1:15:46|He will lazily play with the robotic vacuum cleaner, accidentally dropping a piece of dog food on the floor. Before little Q can eat it, the vacuum cleaner sucks up the food, leaving little Q puzzled. They will go to the park where they used to play together.
1:15:59|1:16:1|Xiao Q will swing on the swing with [Chen Zhiqiao].
1:16:28|1:16:33|Zhiqiao and Chen Qi took a taxi home, passing by the park where Li Baoting often stays.
1:16:38|1:16:51|Little Q looked excitedly out the window. The bench was empty now, and he probably remembered the time playing with [Li Baoting]. One day, Little Q got lost, and the security guard talked to [Chen Zhiqiao] and [Simon].
1:17:2|1:17:4|Xiao Q ran towards [Chen Zhiqiao].
1:17:11|1:17:26|Before long, Li Baoer returned to the chair and squatted down. Previously, Li Baoer had been waiting for Xiao Q to finish playing.
1:17:50|1:17:57|After that, Zhiqiao often took little Qi to the factory to sunbathe. Little Qi lay quietly while Zhiqiao read a book.
1:18:5|1:18:26|As time passed, the season changed from summer to autumn. The leaves of the trees by the bench fell one by one, and the weather turned colder day by day, until the whole world was bare. Time went by slowly, and Xiao Q's body gradually weakened, but Li Baoting never came back.
1:18:38|1:18:41|One morning, [Chen Zhiqiao] came down from upstairs.
1:18:56|1:19:2|She found that there was no less dog food in Li Baoting's bowl. Is she going to be busy? She just wanted to put a leash on Li Baoting and take him to the bathroom. But Li Baoting refused to stand up. No matter how she tried to pick him up, he remained unmoved. She suddenly felt that something was wrong.
1:19:28|1:19:32|The scene shifts, and the veterinarian [Ryan] is examining him.
1:19:40|1:19:44|Because it walks more than the average dog, its wear and tear will be more severe.
1:20:10|1:20:32|Chen Zhiqiao put on protective gear, with two wheels supporting his belly to reduce the pressure on his legs. Li Baoting was listening to Chen Zhiqiao's story on the bench. In the evening, Li Baoting returned home from school.
1:21:8|1:21:35|Little Q looked at the precious photos on the cabinet, including a group photo with the instructor, a family photo with [Li Baoting], a photo of Donggu, and Little Q's handprint. He slowly fell asleep. As days passed, Little Q's health deteriorated, and he underwent another examination.
1:22:17|1:22:25|He listened with a heartache, and said slowly.
1:22:41|1:23:2|Little Q is still waiting for Li Baoting to return. The day has finally arrived, and Little Q seems to sense Li Baoting's arrival, staring fixedly at the door. He struggles to stand up, his left hind leg unable to support him. He hobbles towards the door.
1:23:15|1:23:24|[Li Baoting] tenderly caressed Little Q.
1:23:34|1:23:47|Li Baoting licks Li Baoting's face, tears in his eyes. After a long separation, he hugs Li Baoting tightly. Li Baoting takes Li Baoting back home.
1:24:28|1:24:51|[Li Baoting] and Chen Qi reunited, living together again. The empty house didn't feel lonely. Chen Qi pushed the guide saddle next to [Li Baoting], trying to guide him once again.
1:25:4|1:25:28|[Li Baoting] caressed Little Q, and then walked out the door with him. On the nighttime sidewalk, Little Q walked slowly but still meticulously guided [Li Baoting] along the way.
1:25:34|1:25:58|At the intersection, they stood quietly waiting for the traffic lights. The city at night was deserted and very quiet. Chen Qi's body was very weak, so he had to sit down and rest while waiting for the traffic lights. The road was quiet, with only a few vehicles passing by.
1:26:3|1:26:24|The green light came on, [Li Baoting] struggled to get up. Instead, he heard the words "move forward" that [Li Baoting] had said countless times. They slowly passed through the intersection, memories of the past flooding into [Li Baoting]'s mind. Reluctance, heartache, and gratitude turned into tears streaming down his cheeks.
1:27:7|1:27:21|[Chen Qi] wearily lay down, resting his head on [Li Baoting]'s lap, while [Li Baoting] sat on the ground, stroking [Chen Qi].
1:27:27|1:27:46|In the pet hospital, Li Baoting is trying to save Xiao Q, performing CPR on him. Outside the emergency room, Li Baoting and others are anxiously waiting for the result. Seeing a guide dog leading a blind person passing by, Chen Kangyaner says.
1:28:47|1:29:11|[Li Baoting] successfully rescued [Chen Qi]. He lay exhausted with a breathing apparatus, surrounded by everyone. [Chen Qi] quietly watched them. In the end, [Li Baoting] decided to take [Chen Qi] to the small island to play again. At this point, [Chen Qi] could no longer walk.
1:29:16|1:29:38|Mr. Li, supported by [Li Baoer], carries Little Q forward with the paper bridge beside them. Little Q looks at the familiar island and river. Arriving at the riverbank, Mr. Li settles Little Q into a chair.
1:30:16|1:30:22|Mr. Li took the phone from [Li Baoer]'s hand, and a few people gathered around Little Q to strike a pose.
1:30:55|1:31:11|In the distance, a group of people are playing with their dogs on the lawn. Mr. Li, with his eyes wide open, watches the people playing in the distance, feeling the emotions of little Q as he strokes him.
1:31:23|1:31:33|Li Qi was helped to the grass.
1:31:46|1:32:4|With heavy steps, [Chen Qi] slowly walked towards the crowd playing in the distance. Halfway there, he turned around and looked at Mr. [Li].
1:32:10|1:32:18|He turned his head and walked towards the crowd. People in the distance noticed Little Q and lovingly caressed her.
1:32:39|1:32:41|[Li Baoting] is lost in imagination and memories.
1:32:46|1:32:55|He imagined Little Q running, jumping, and having fun now. In the sunshine, Little Q was full of vitality.
1:33:0|1:33:13|He recalled the time spent with Chen Zhiqiao at the Guide Dog Association, watching the paper sheath welcome and train new guide dogs.
1:33:15|1:33:23|He sunbathed on the bench with Chen Zhiqiao, only scratching her itch for her. They played baseball together in the snow.
1:33:36|1:33:54|It was Little Q's birthday, and people prepared a baseball-shaped cake for him. There was also the time when [Li Baoer] blindfolded herself and ran with Little Q under his guidance. [Li Baoting] took Little Q to the pet hospital for a check-up.
1:34:16|1:34:23|And that time, instead of secretly hiding the baseball bat, he gave the children money to buy the baseball.
1:34:32|1:34:51|On the night of their first encounter, Xiao Q was driven under the car by [Li Baoting], and it was the [Bar Owner] who fed Xiao Q. [Li Baoting] himself also did not sleep all night. Before meeting Xiao Q, at the Guide Dog Association, [Chen Zhiqiao] patiently trained him and gave him a bath.
1:34:56|1:35:5|Moving back in time, it turns out that Chen Zhiqiao and Li Baoting used to secretly play baseball with little Q after Chen Kangyaner left.
1:35:5|1:35:19|Sometimes, Chen Kangyaner blow-dries Li Baoting's hair, and Li Baoting helps Chen Zhiqiao blow-dry her hair. Chen Zhiqiao then takes care of Donggu and Little Q's hair together, and the family is harmonious. The scene of Chen Zhiqiao and Little Q playing in the park is also vivid.
1:35:28|1:35:51|In the end, [Li Baoting] also remembered how young Qi looked, like a little ball of fur, back when he was with his siblings, who would all grow up to be excellent guide dogs. At that time, Qi still wore a red collar next to his mother, with a birthmark on his belly, resembling a seagull soaring with outstretched wings.
1:35:54|1:36:11|After Xiao Q passed away, only flowers were seen planted in the yard. Suddenly, he found that baseball in the soil. Xiao Q carried the baseball and buried it. Li Baoting looked on with a contented smile.
1:36:18|1:36:44|[Li Baoting] did not want a second guide dog. He came to the familiar little island for camping alone, holding the baseball that Little Q liked tightly in his hand. Then he threw the baseball hard, and it rolled to a stone with "Little Q, your footprints will always remain in my heart" carved on it. Beside it was the guide dog saddle full of memories.
