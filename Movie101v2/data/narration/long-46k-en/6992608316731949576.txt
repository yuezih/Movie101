0:3:26|0:3:35|With his sister urging them on, the family gathered together and followed the man out of the hospital. Glancing back at the pursuing family, the man took out his wallet from his pocket, walked down the steps of the gate, and pulled out a business card.
0:3:44|0:3:56|Ignoring the gratitude of the crowd, the man put away his wallet and left, catching the congestion of Beijing's rush hour. The honking on the overpass made the whole city seem a bit restless.
0:4:0|0:4:6|The man looked at his father gesturing towards him and spoke:
0:4:38|0:4:56|The man comforted his mother, walked back to the kitchen, and threw the meat filling along with the bowl and chopsticks into the trash can. The scene shifted to a construction training ground, where two fully armed men were practicing fencing. Just then, the phone rang.
0:4:59|0:5:19|At the same time, the two men in the struggle also determined the winner. Hearing the shouts of friends, the man took off his protective gear, smiled, and walked to the side to pick up the phone. The training ground was filled with the sound of fitness collisions, and people were immersed in the excitement of competition in groups of three or two.
0:5:19|0:5:25|The man took off his gear, listening to the sound on the phone with a serious expression on his face.
0:5:54|0:6:17|Colleague Shanshan hurriedly helped the man adjust his tie. After a brief conversation, under the urging of company executive [Robert], the man began preparing for an advertising campaign. The scene shifted to the conference room, but David still hadn't shown up.
0:6:19|0:6:27|The sudden ringing of the phone broke the silence in the meeting room, [Robert] glanced at the text message, then closed his phone and spoke up:
0:6:36|0:6:42|The man, [Zhang Guoguo], who is the planning manager of an advertising company, smiled and said:
0:7:26|0:7:41|He leaned over the table and glanced at [Robert], then turned to the four clients opposite and said confidently: As soon as he said this, everyone present showed varying degrees of surprise on their faces.
0:7:44|0:7:55|Zhang Guoguo picked up the water glass in front of her and said, [Robert] awkwardly smiled and took a sip of water, looking at the client across from him.
0:8:1|0:8:13|By the time Zhang Guoguo finished speaking, the clients had lost interest. They whispered among themselves, and the presentation ended hastily. In the meeting room, only [Robert] and Zhang Guoguo were left.
0:8:29|0:8:39|Zhang Guoguo took a deep look at [Robert], then leaned back in the chair, gazing at her own palm, and slowly said:
0:8:45|0:9:19|Meeting [Robert]'s gaze, Zhang Guoguo leaned forward and said with a hint of implication: The words seemed to touch a nerve with [Robert], as he coldly closed his phone, then stood up and addressed Zhang Guoguo before leaving the meeting room. With only Zhang Guoguo left in the room, he watched [Robert] leave, his face serious as he pondered over [Robert]'s words just now.
0:9:19|0:9:38|After a while, he picked up his suit jacket and left the meeting room. A month later, Zhang Guoguo sat at his desk with his eyes closed, deep in thought. Behind him, Susan was helping him organize his personal belongings. The slight noise caught Zhang Guoguo's attention, and he turned around to meet Susan's somewhat tender gaze.
0:9:46|0:9:56|Listening to the whispers of former colleagues, watching the planning documents being transferred on the computer, Zhang Guoguo's face showed no sadness or regret, appearing unusually calm.
0:10:6|0:10:20|Three months later, Susan arrived at the front desk of another advertising company, ready to meet with Zhang Guoguo. This was a more modern advertising company. Coming out of the cozy negotiation room, Zhang Guoguo led Susan to her office.
0:10:54|0:11:1|Susan looked at the stern man in front of her without giving a direct answer, and slowly said:
0:11:25|0:11:39|Zhang Guoguo remained silent, staring at her for a long time, then furrowed her brows and spoke up with a questioning tone. A hint of resentment and displeasure seemed to be visible on his face, as his complex expression gradually sank into a mysterious darkness.
0:11:39|0:11:49|The scene shifts to Beijing in 1962, where a [young man] in sportswear with a canvas bag slung over his shoulder is standing outside the hospital pharmacy window.
0:12:5|0:12:22|[Shen Guangyao] smiled, then walked to the side and opened the door. In the pharmacy, more than ten nurses all looked towards the [Shen Guangyao] who had just entered. They were wearing masks, so their faces were not clear, only revealing a pair of smiling eyes. The room was filled with a strong medicinal scent.
0:12:24|0:12:43|[Male Student] slightly bent over to express his gratitude. Before he could even sit down properly, he heard a nurse asking him: Although all the nurses had thick gauze masks covering their faces, [Male Student] quickly recognized [Wang Minjia], who was standing by the window packing medicinal herbs. As their eyes met, [Male Student] smiled sweetly.
0:12:50|0:13:0|Seeing a corner missing from the stamp on the medicine packet, only two characters of [Wang Minjia]'s name remained on the paper, but [Robert] paid close attention to this detail.
0:13:0|0:13:32|At the end of the workday, the nurses changed into casual clothes and walked out of the pharmacy. [Robert] was reading a book in the corridor, and [Wang Minjia] changed her clothes and stood next to him. A nurse jokingly said to them after a brief farewell. After that, [Wang Minjia] led [Robert] to walk quickly, leaning on the railing with both hands. [Wang Minjia] shouted:
0:13:37|0:13:47|Li Xiang, wearing a white coat, turned to Dean Ding and explained, "The three of us were classmates in high school, [Wang Minjia]'s family is impatiently urging us."
0:14:10|0:14:20|Li Xiang asked them while chasing after them. A painting of a labor youth hung on the wall where they had lingered.
0:14:47|0:14:54|Three people arrived at the teacher's house and happened to see the scene of the teacher's mother beating the teacher as if she had gone mad.
0:16:0|0:16:21|In front of Li Xiang are many folders spread out, as he carefully searches for relevant text inside. [Wang Minjia], on the other hand, steps on the text that Li Xiang has found on the letter paper, writing the whole letter with different notes. These two young people with a strong sense of justice choose to use this method to alert the teacher's mother and uphold Teacher Xu.
0:16:41|0:17:8|[Chen Peng] sat up straight. He was the boy who went to the hospital to find [Wang Minjia] that day. [Chen Peng] politely refused the principal's hint with a smile. In this era, being able to work in a research institute was a dream opportunity for anyone. However, this outstanding young man in front of them chose to refuse without hesitation. The principal and everyone in the office were puzzled.
0:17:11|0:17:28|The scene shifts to the bustling crowd at Tiananmen Square, where [Chen Peng] is seen with a smile on his face, weaving through the crowded people. Accidentally bumping into a pedestrian, he drops the seal he was holding in his hand.
0:17:28|0:18:4|[Chen Peng] hurriedly apologized, then quickly bent down to search for the lost seal. Pedestrians jostled past, their moving legs disrupting [Chen Peng]'s line of sight. The seal he captured a second ago was soon covered by the surging crowd. Finally, [Chen Peng] squeezed through the crowd and picked up the seal. [Wang Minjia] led him to the front of Tiananmen Square to take a photo, saying [Chen Peng] handed the seal to [Wang Minjia] and put the gift away. [Wang Minjia] innocently asked.
0:18:6|0:18:15|[Chen Peng] smiled without answering, under the direction of the photographer, the three of them stood in front of Tiananmen Square for a group photo.
0:18:59|0:19:7|[Wang Minjia] flips through the photo album to show the gathered crowd.
0:19:29|0:19:49|[Wang Minjia] seems oblivious to the whispers of some people, lost in her own glory. On the other side, [Chen Peng] waves away the mosquitoes around him, but his gaze remains fixed on the wooden flower he is carving, perhaps a gift for the person he cares for.
0:19:56|0:20:19|In the hospital conference room, listening to Li Xiang's grandiose words and watching him write the blood oath with his finger, everyone enthusiastically applauded. [Wang Minjia] did the same, but unlike others, there was a hint of complexity in his gaze towards Li Xiang. [Chen Peng] remained completely unaware of what was happening in the hospital. On the table full of debris, he was single-mindedly carving out his intentions.
0:20:19|0:20:28|The indelible image in his mind was always the floral dress on [Wang Minjia] in front of Tiananmen Square that day, along with her forever innocent smile.
0:20:28|0:21:0|The scene shifts to a courtyard, where the glass awards hanging on the wall reflect the suppressed figure of Teacher Xu. Hearing his wife's call from outside the door, Teacher Xu's eating motion suddenly stiffens. He picks up his bowl and chopsticks, walks out of the house, and approaches the neighbor.
0:21:16|0:21:32|The wife was still doing laundry, while the husband turned a blind eye and helped the neighbor. In the evening, the wife scalded a bowl of porridge with boiling water, stirring it with chopsticks and swallowing it herself. Teacher Xu had already laid down on the bed, looking through the curtains at his wife, when suddenly a strange noise came from the courtyard.
0:21:32|0:21:48|Attracted the attention of the two. The wife walked out of the house to check and found a stone on the ground with a letter attached, with a few words pasted on the envelope, "To be received by [Liu Shufen]," which is the woman's name, and inside was a warning letter written by [Wang Minjia].
0:21:52|0:22:29|Liu Shufen ignored the neighbors and rushed back home in anger. Holding the letter in his hand high, he fiercely slapped it on Teacher Xu's face. Teacher Xu silently endured, looking at his wife in front of him without saying a word. Upon hearing her husband's words, Liu Shufen's eyes suddenly became moist. She choked for a long time before asking back miserably:
0:22:43|0:22:57|She rudely pounded her husband's shoulder while talking, Mr. Xu didn't want to argue with her, so he avoided his wife and went to the living room, took out his cup and water bottle. [Liu Shufen] picked up the fallen letter from the ground and said to her husband:
0:23:18|0:23:30|Xu Bochang, who has always been gentle and refined, is now unusually excited. He loudly questions Liu Shufen, but sees her already in tears, so he calms down and tidies up the table.
0:23:46|0:24:5|She picked up a stack of porcelain bowls from the cupboard and ran towards Xu Bochang, who was sitting at the desk preparing to grade assignments. Before Liu Shufen could finish speaking, Xu Bochang had already solemnly shook his head.
0:24:46|0:24:58|The scene fades away as the two people confront each other, their intense breathing gradually disappearing. Accompanied by the sound of rustling sheets, the smile of [Wang Minjia] in the hospital appears before the eyes.
0:25:6|0:25:12|As [Wang Minjia] took the clip from her colleague and hastily hung up the sheets, she was about to leave.
0:25:22|0:25:28|At the same time, outside the hospital gate, [Chen Peng] was running frantically towards the hospital.
0:25:42|0:25:56|Wang Minjia, who was washing her feet in front of the faucet with cold water, heard Li Xiang's words and couldn't help but look over solemnly. She closed the valve and whispered to Li Xiang, "Then you must study hard."
0:26:32|0:26:53|Wang Minjia had already unbuttoned her cuffs, rolled up her sleeves, and a hand as white as the moonlight was revealed in front of Li Xiang. Under the sunlight, Li Xiang only felt the girl's skin shimmering with colorful light, the fine hairs swaying in the wind, so small yet always effortlessly stirring into his most secret heart.
0:26:53|0:27:14|Li Xiang was infatuated and confused at some point, reaching out and holding the arm, their bodies touching. In their originally sincere gazes, an inexplicable affection quietly emerged. [Wang Minjia] avoided Li Xiang's gaze, her words were tactful, full of feminine charm. Li Xiang was left stunned after hearing them.
0:27:14|0:27:44|Coincidentally, this scene was witnessed by [Chen Peng] who had just arrived. He turned away from a distance, the needle pierced his arm, and the cry seemed to penetrate everything, directly hitting [Chen Peng] in the distance. The apricot forest was desolate, and the sunlight of [Chen Peng]'s past fell to the ground like the leaves. He stubbornly walked to the principal's office, and the love of his student days was always blind.
0:27:44|0:28:9|[Chen Peng] made a decision he had never considered before with determination and impulsiveness. The scene plunged into darkness, and when it lit up again, it had already arrived in Kunming during the Republic of China era in 1938. Along the way, an old, rundown minibus kicked up dust as it moved forward, the engine buzzing for a moment before the vehicle broke down on the side of the road. The driver tried to start it by turning the key, but it just wouldn't start.
0:28:17|0:28:24|On the car were a group of young students, and at that moment, a boy with a straw hat jumped off a horse.
0:28:54|0:29:7|Two got off the car to check the situation. The twins, dressed in British-style shirts, sweaters, and vests, asked, "The boy smiled and got back on the horse."
0:29:27|0:29:37|Against the backdrop of teachers' conversations, the scene shifts to a school construction site where resources are scarce and rising prices make the construction process extremely challenging.
0:29:37|0:29:58|The screen shows several lines of text: In 1937, the Japanese army occupied Beiping. Teachers and students from Tsinghua University first went to Changsha, then to Kunming to join Peking University and Nankai University. They jointly established Southwest United University on the barren land north of Kunming. Dozens of thatched cottages gathered in the field represent the full picture of this school.
0:29:58|0:30:24|On the campus, the boy who had just arrived in a carriage looked up at the pine tree in front of him. He then took out a notebook from the bag on his back, held a pencil from his pocket, and concentrated on drawing something in the notebook. At that moment, the twin-like classmates noticed the boy and asked in amazement. The boy nodded at them, and they didn't wait for his response before leading him forward and running ahead.
0:30:25|0:30:31|Three people arrived at the school gate and stopped in front of a wall.
0:30:55|0:31:13|Accompanied by the conversation between the principal and the teachers, Southwest United University was hit by a heavy rain. The rain was so loud that the students in the classroom could hardly hear the teacher's voice, even though the teacher had already been hoarse.
0:31:49|0:31:58|The dense and sharp raindrops hit the tin roof, turning the entire classroom into a resonating chamber. Apart from the sound of rain, it was difficult for the students to hear any other noises.
0:31:58|0:32:10|The elderly teacher Sheng felt helpless and could only write the four words "sitting quietly listening to the rain" on the blackboard with chalk. The rain was relentless, gathering into streams along the roof's seams and falling down, wetting everyone's clothes.
0:32:17|0:32:24|The water gradually soaked the mud on the classroom floor, accumulating into puddles, like scars that harm people.
0:32:26|0:32:45|The environment of Southwest United University is still like this, not to mention China at this time, which is already full of holes and people are in panic. Here is just a microcosm of the suffering experienced by the Chinese nation. Listening to the thunderstorm quietly, feeling the loneliness, [Shen Guangyao] pushed open the window and looked out at the mountains and rivers outside.
0:33:0|0:33:17|By the river, the old man in a raincoat gathered the fishing net. Despite the heavy rain pouring down, only one fish was struggling in the net. This scene was witnessed by Shen Guangyao and etched into the hearts of the teachers and students.
0:33:19|0:33:25|Against the backdrop of the vendor's calls, the rain clears up and the scene shifts to a market in Kunming city, where
0:33:31|0:33:41|Kunming is located in a remote area, the market is still lively, various shouts fill the streets, the tension of war seems to have dissipated a lot, suddenly a student shouts,
0:33:55|0:34:4|[Shen Guangyao] and Xiaolin sat in a street stall, watching the slender child next to them skillfully serving rice, making him feel both distressed and touched.
0:34:34|0:34:59|The conversation was interrupted by the shouting of the newspaper seller. The three of them left the restaurant and bought a newspaper to read carefully. The paper reported: "Multiple fires in the bustling district, heavy casualties among innocent civilians." Feeling the heavy atmosphere, they looked around and saw people in panic. The scene then shifted to a school, where on a makeshift platform, a large wheel driven by an iron ring kept turning, causing Da Lin to shout uncontrollably.
0:34:59|0:35:13|The spinning wheel suddenly stopped, and with the help of an American soldier, he staggered onto a narrow bench. He walked unsteadily with his hands flat, but still couldn't resist the dizziness brought by the lack of balance.
0:35:13|0:35:29|Finally falling off the bench, the officer in charge of selecting trainees stood up and said that to become a pilot, one must always have a good sense of direction and spatial balance, and this special talent is innate.
0:35:37|0:35:43|Looking around at the students discussing, he walked to the front of the stage and asked, then continued to mock and ask if the students were afraid of coming on stage and embarrassing themselves?
0:35:45|0:35:51|Looking at the hesitant students, the military officer sighed.
0:36:11|0:36:28|[Shen Guangyao] was inspired by the officer's words, he walked solemnly towards the stage, passing through the crowd of students to the front. He neatly placed his school bag on the table, then with both hands on the wooden board, he leaped effortlessly onto the platform.
0:36:28|0:36:34|Amidst the classmates' exclamations, [Shen Guangyao] stepped into the Ferris wheel, pulled down the safety bar, secured his footrest, nodded slightly, indicating that he was ready.
0:36:36|0:36:42|Pushed by American soldiers, [Shen Guangyao] spun rapidly in the shape of a large character.
0:36:42|0:37:2|As the wheel spins faster and faster, the students in the audience nervously look at [Shen Guangyao] in the machine. Their eyes are filled with worry and anticipation, and even the American officer starts to pay more attention, his eyes behind the sunglasses fixed on the young student spinning. Surprisingly, the focal point [Shen Guangyao] doesn't show much reaction at this moment.
0:37:3|0:37:26|The officer told the soldiers not to turn anymore, so the two soldiers stopped moving. In the machine, [Shen Guangyao]'s eyes were still clear, but the continuous spinning made his head feel a bit hot. He walked out of the machine and refused the American soldier who wanted to help him. He walked steadily towards a bench on his own, stepped onto the bench, lifted his slightly stable body, and raised his hands to find balance.
0:37:26|0:37:32|Taking the first step tentatively, she then walked steadily and quickly forward once she found her footing.
0:37:50|0:38:4|The scene shifts to a forest, where [Shen Guangyao] is running joyfully with Dalin, Xiaolin, and the children selling noodles. A long snake coiled on a tree catches everyone's attention, and they cautiously approach it.
0:38:6|0:38:25|The long snake, as if sensing danger, slithered down from the tree trunk, wriggling on the ground. Seizing the opportunity, [Shen Guangyao] rushed up from the side where the snake was moving, grabbed its head, swung his arm, wrapped the snake around his arm, then stuffed it into a bag and excitedly ran towards the school.
0:38:25|0:38:30|The dangerous python in his hands was as easy to catch as a child's toy.
0:38:58|0:39:14|Even in a remote area, even in a simple thatched hut, as long as teachers and students are united, even if the conditions are harsh, the atmosphere of learning will not change. Passing by the dormitory, [Shen Guangyao] saw the servant from his hometown through the window, so he hurried into the dormitory and warmly called out to his mother: Seeing her son full of spirit, the mother couldn't contain her joy in her eyes.
0:39:25|0:39:44|Uncle Shen and his wife exchanged a glance, then quickly got up and left the dormitory. Shen Guangyao's Mother, elegant and graceful, showed no signs of fatigue despite the journey. She sat by the bed and ordered her son to recite the family rules, the third and seventh rules. Shen Guangyao tried to evade, but his mother was stern, so he obediently recited them.
0:40:54|0:41:0|For example, reading thousands of books, traveling thousands of miles, and marrying the girl you like to have children. Speaking of this,
0:41:15|0:41:24|After speaking, Shen Guangyao's Mother sighed and continued to earnestly advise, holding up the Air Force Academy enrollment brochure to her chest, she told her son,
0:41:33|0:41:45|It's just an illusion of life. Watching her son unmoved, [Shen Guangyao's Mother] couldn't help but ask him if he understood. [Shen Guangyao] knelt on the ground, slowly lowered his head without saying a word, and [Shen Guangyao's Mother] fell silent too.
0:41:45|0:42:1|Yu Guangli [Shen Guangyao] saw [Shen Guangyao's Mother] pressing the handkerchief against her nose. He slowly lifted his head and found that [Shen Guangyao's Mother] had tears streaming down her face at some point. He quickly spoke to comfort her, but [Shen Guangyao's Mother] was so emotional that the tears had already been uncontrollable. Aunt Shen, who was packing luggage on the side, explained.
0:42:4|0:42:11|[Shen Guangyao's Mother] was very worried all the way. Following Aunt Shen's words, [Shen Guangyao's Mother] expressed her concern that her son hadn't figured out how to live the rest of his life without losing it.
0:42:20|0:42:24|Watching [Shen Guangyao's Mother] with tears in her eyes, [Shen Guangyao] knelt on the ground in agony. He quickly told [Shen Guangyao's Mother] that he had quit the army, and only when he made a solemn vow at the end did [Shen Guangyao's Mother] finally believe and help him up with Aunt Shen.
0:42:24|0:42:32|Outside the window, Dalin and Xiaolin, who were peeking, were politely asked to leave by Uncle Shen to discuss something inside.
0:43:11|0:43:21|[Shen Guangyao's Mother] is helping her son tidy up his clothes in the dormitory, keeping everything in order. She discusses with Aunt Shen about unraveling and widening her son's sweater.
0:43:24|0:43:27|Shen Guangyao's Mother smiled gently at the classmate and said,
0:43:34|0:43:45|Guangyao smiled and replied that he was already an adult, so he wouldn't grow taller anymore. Then he took out a bottle from his pocket and told Uncle Shen that it was snake bile, which was said to be very effective for eye diseases. He hoped Uncle Shen could pass it on to his father.
0:43:45|0:44:0|Just as Guangyao was about to hand over the snake gallbladder to Uncle Shen, Uncle Shen made a move resembling Wing Chun, which made Guangyao smile knowingly. The two engaged in a friendly exchange, ultimately ending in a draw. Uncle Shen then took the medicine bottle, looking at Guangyao with relief.
0:44:2|0:44:29|Against the backdrop of the shouting at the small stall, the scene shifts to the snow-filled Beijing in 1923. In the dim light of dawn, Tsinghua students gather in front of the notice board to check their results. They receive sweet potatoes from familiar classmates, and three of them carry kerosene lamps to the board where their results are posted. In the English column of the notice, they find...
0:44:29|0:44:52|[Wu Linglan]'s name is unique. Amidst the discussions of his classmates, [Wu Linglan] let his gaze wander along the physics notice board until it reached the very bottom, where he finally saw his own name. Pushing aside a classmate's arm blocking his view, [Wu Linglan] stared intently at his name at the very end of the physics rankings.
0:45:4|0:45:13|The uncle posted notices while casually comforting students with poor grades. The camera then cuts to outside the office.
0:45:20|0:45:41|Ignoring the comfort of classmates, [Wu Linglan] walked towards the office with his head down. In the long corridor, only one classmate stood alone with arms raised at the cuffs. [Wu Linglan] remained silent with his head down, while the sharp sound of the kettle in the office continued to echo.
0:45:50|0:45:57|The teacher handed the water to [Wu Linglan], pulled out a chair and sat down, asking:
0:46:10|0:46:19|[Wu Linglan] frowned and waited for the teacher's next words.
0:46:36|0:47:6|The teacher's words connected the story of the entire film. As he answered, the screen showed a panicked crowd in Kunming, countless failed carvings of small flowers in wood chips, and finally, the awakening of Zhang Guoguo from her sleep.
0:47:6|0:47:12|Watching the teacher [Wu Linglan] who was lost in thought, finally spoke.
0:47:16|0:47:39|[Wu Linglan] bowed deeply, then turned and left the office with a sense of melancholy. Unconsciously, he found himself outside a classroom where a traditional Chinese teacher with long braids was lecturing on the podium, and students in long robes were sitting upright, listening attentively to the treasures of Chinese culture.
0:47:41|0:47:54|[Wu Linglan] seemed to be touched. In the swirling snow, the school bell rang, echoing solemnly in the vast campus. The teacher in the classroom stopped teaching.
0:48:16|0:48:25|He chatted warmly with the students, while the Chinese teacher packed up the teaching materials and occasionally glanced at the English teacher before leaving the classroom. [Wu Linglan] watched carefully and pondered.
0:49:7|0:49:18|The classmates dispersed noisily, and in the small upstairs compartment, [Wu Linglan] had been immersed here for quite some time, flipping through books in Chinese and English, experiencing the cultures of different countries and ethnicities.
0:49:36|0:49:44|[Wu Linglan] also arrived at the scene, and he heard foreign friends asking about each person.
0:50:4|0:50:11|In the scene where Tagore visits Tsinghua University, following the sharp and piercing alarm sound, the scene shifts to Kunming, where the alarm goes off.
0:50:32|0:50:41|Unlike the classmates who hurriedly took shelter, [Shen Guangyao] walked with a dark expression, showing no intention of avoiding the air raid.
0:50:44|0:50:50|Saying that, [Shen Guangyao] opened the paper bag, poured some wolfberry lotus seed floral tea into the teacup.
0:51:2|0:51:15|The teacher finished speaking and then turned to walk outside, so [Shen Guangyao] followed suit, leaving the kitchen together, looking at the water glass. The teacher said,
0:51:27|0:51:37|The two of them chatted slowly and methodically, leaving the campus. Outside the campus, many residents also walked towards the fields with the students.
0:51:37|0:52:15|On the mountaintop, the monk cooking saw a plane in the distance, dropped the ladle in his hand, quickly lifted up the lantern prepared in advance, warning the people below. In the clear sky of Kunming, Japanese warplanes roared past. In the hills and gullies, villagers and students hurriedly hid, either taking cover in the woods, concealing their figures, or hiding in caves. The campus was empty and quiet, sleeping peacefully. The kitchen still filled with smoke, everything seemed strangely calm and peaceful as in the past.
0:52:15|0:52:31|Teachers and students followed a rugged dirt road to a secluded corner with lush trees. They used the natural twists and turns as their classroom, leaning against the walls or sitting on the ground, teaching and learning, listening to instructions, enjoying themselves.
0:53:43|0:54:4|The teacher who left with [Shen Guangyao] sighed like this. His name is [Wu Linglan], the confused male student who listened to and contemplated Tagore's speech in the Tsinghua University library more than ten years ago.
0:55:1|0:55:31|After a brief bombing by the Japanese army on the outskirts of Kunming, everyone returned to the devastated school. The journey had been arduous, and the teachers and students were in great distress. Shen Guangyao, usually neat and clean, was now covered in blood and tears, standing among the chaotic crowd. He gazed at the collapsed, flaming kitchen, unable to calm down for a long time. As night fell, Shen Guangyao still recalled the day's horrors.
0:55:36|0:55:55|The child selling noodles, Ashan, lying in a pool of blood, struggling for breath, kept flashing before his eyes. The scenes of playing together, laughing and catching snake gall, were still vivid. The war was cruel, in just one morning, the lively lives and beautiful campus fell apart.
0:55:56|0:56:3|Outside Kunming city, the air was filled with gun smoke and the sounds of war, echoing with cries of sorrow and grief.
0:56:4|0:56:18|[Shen Guangyao] sat in the ruins of the campus, rain pouring down, unmoved by the suffering of his fellow victims, the pain lingering in his ears along with the rain. As night fell, Southwest United University lost its former scholarly atmosphere.
0:56:19|0:56:33|The remaining sadness in the grass stove overflowed slowly with time, lying in the broken mountains and rivers of Kunming, stirring up the manly spirit. The next morning, posters declaring to die rather than be a slave to the country were posted on the wall.
0:56:42|0:56:56|[Shen Guangyao] who had not slept all night, strode forward on the street with a determined look. They met at the school gate, having had a spiritual connection before. Both of them, who had experienced the same confusion, were now immersed in their own sadness at this moment.
0:56:56|0:57:11|Shen Guang walked to the ruins where Ashan died, stopped, took off the prayer beads in his hand, gently placed them on the blood-stained rocks, Shen Guangyao seemed to have a plan, and decisively left the school.
0:57:21|0:57:49|The stirring and deep voice leads the scene to an open space in the mountains of Yunnan, where numerous laborers are lined up in the long night, using ropes to drag behind them a huge stone roller. The mountains and hills in Yunnan are continuous and undulating, and the flat land under the laborers' feet is completely ground out inch by inch by human power. Although they are tired and exhausted, they have no complaints, because they know they are building an air force training base.
0:57:54|0:58:0|The situation was deadlocked, and even before the Air Force Academy was fully established, the soldiers' training had already begun.
0:58:9|0:58:15|Among the countless trained students, the figure of [Shen Guangyao] also appeared.
0:58:31|0:58:35|During training, when Shen Guangyao heard his comrades talking about getting along with each other, he did not respond.
0:58:57|0:59:5|How to save one's own life. The soldiers responded loudly in agreement, and the scene gradually faded away in [Shen Guangyao]'s determined gaze.
0:59:8|0:59:15|In the darkness, [Zhang Guoguo] woke up from a nightmare, gasping for breath, and answered the vibrating phone.
0:59:23|0:59:37|Upon hearing the news, [Zhang Guoguo] quickly got out of bed and arrived at the hospital. Outside the ward, the child's family, [Zhang Guoguo] and Su Shan anxiously waited. Memories flooded [Zhang Guoguo]'s mind.
0:59:47|0:59:56|Breaking free from her memories, [Zhang Guoguo] glanced back at the clock, which showed it was already 3:00 in the morning. The [doctor] emerged from the observation room and looked at everyone, saying:
1:0:2|1:0:23|Several people followed the direction pointed by [the doctor], looking through the glass and into the incubator. A tiny baby lay weakly inside, with thin gauze wrapped around his head and tubes inserted in his mouth and nose. His small chest rose and fell rapidly. Outside the protective glass, [Zhang Guoguo] slowly closed her eyes, feeling a bit relieved.
1:0:23|1:0:33|Shortly after, the group arrived at the small room where the quadruplets lived. The elderly mother poured a cup of hot water and handed it to [Zhang Guoguo].
1:1:8|1:1:33|After some time, [Zhang Guoguo] went to the supermarket to buy milk powder. Different brands, various packaging of milk powder were displayed in front of her. [Zhang Guoguo], who worked in an advertising company, naturally scoffed at these fascinating advertisements. Instead of these superficial advertising slogans, she preferred to trust her own judgment. She bought a can of each different brand of milk powder. She and Susan returned to the hospital.
1:1:33|1:1:43|While personally tasting and searching for relevant information, [Zhang Guoguo] picked up a paper cup in front of her to signal.
1:1:49|1:1:55|After some thought, [Zhang Guoguo] pushed the can of milk powder in front of her away.
1:2:3|1:2:14|With a soft response, [Zhang Guoguo] got up and left the hospital. The newly rented room was quiet and bright, with three children comfortably sleeping in their cribs.
1:2:47|1:2:54|After some time, Zhang Guoguo received a lucky name for her child from a Mr. Qiming. She opened the book and began to read it carefully.
1:4:31|1:4:58|The speaker unintentionally, the listener intentionally, Robert's words made Zhang Guoguo, who was originally immersed in the joy of being a parent, a little worried. Coming out of the badminton court, the two bought coffee and stood on the roadside to rest. Looking at Zhang Guoguo, who was dressed lightly, Robert couldn't help but sigh: Zhang Guoguo thought for a moment, then turned and asked Robert:
1:5:22|1:5:27|[Zhang Guoguo] said nothing, just recalling the scene when she received a phone call from her unit during fencing training that day.
1:6:0|1:6:21|A motorcycle gang roared past, interrupting Zhang Guoguo's reminiscence. Robert's remark went unanswered as he left with a dark expression. Sensing Zhang Guoguo's inner conflict, Robert revealed a secretive smile.
1:6:21|1:6:30|The next day, [Zhang Guoguo] returned to his alma mater Tsinghua University, enjoying the pleasant environment and easing the recent frustration. He was feeding a stray kitten on the steps outside the teaching building.
1:6:38|1:7:7|After bidding farewell to the gentle kitten, [Zhang Guoguo] ran in the campus filled with the fragrance of books, temporarily avoiding the intrigues of the company. The campus was bathed in warm sunlight, with lush greenery. Students were either alone or sitting in small groups in quiet corners, reading quietly and chatting softly. As the phone rang, [Zhang Guoguo] slowed down, answered the call,
1:7:17|1:7:39|On campus, [Zhang Guoguo] hung up the phone helplessly, let out a long sigh, and sat on the nearby steps to rest. The words of [Robert] kept lingering in his mind, making him wary of the quadruplets family. After who knows how many days, he no longer had the mood to walk or run on campus. He just sweated on the treadmill in the company.
1:7:39|1:7:46|With a worried look, [Shen Guangyao's Mother] walked quickly towards him and turned off the machine, asking,
1:8:2|1:8:29|Listening to what [Susan] said, [Zhang Guoguo] just wiped her arms with a towel, remaining silent for a long time. In the helpless silence between the two, the sound of insects gradually became clearer, leading the time back to the early days of the founding of the country. The scene shifted to [Xu Bochang]'s home, where [Liu Shufen] thought she was charmingly caressing her legs, her eyes fixed on her husband who was grading papers. Seeing that he was unmoved, [Liu Shufen] walked over to the dressing table and sat down.
1:8:29|1:8:51|After watching for a while, [Xu Bochang] intentionally opened the drawer, the noise reached [Xu Bochang]'s ears, he just glanced at [Liu Shufen] slightly and then lowered his head to work. [Liu Shufen] was annoyed and closed the drawer, but still looked at her husband expectantly. Unfortunately, [Xu Bochang] never turned his head again. [Liu Shufen] had to sit back on the bed with a pout.
1:8:51|1:8:58|She pulled the blanket and lay down lonely. As usual, she fell asleep while feeling angry and suppressing herself.
1:8:58|1:9:20|Unfortunately, these days have been a bit different from usual. [Liu Shufen] has been pondering how to expose the person who wrote that warning letter. As she looked at her husband who was still grading papers, she seemed to have some clues. Retrieving the letter from under the pillow, [Liu Shufen] examined it once again. Finally, some subtle clues began to connect in her mind.
1:9:20|1:9:26|Placing the letter on the bed, she got up and casually picked up the small stool on the floor, hurriedly walking behind the cabinet.
1:9:27|1:9:45|Out of curiosity, [Xu Bochang] finally shifted his gaze temporarily to [Liu Shufen]. He saw [Liu Shufen] standing on a stool, lifting the cover of the cabinet to reveal stacks of graduates' exercise books underneath, untying the ropes binding them. [Liu Shufen] stubbornly craned her neck, frantically searching for something.
1:9:45|1:9:58|Xu Bochang didn't know the intention behind Liu Shufen's actions, thinking she was just venting. He shifted his gaze away from her, took a big sip of water from his portable lunch box, and then sat back at his desk to continue grading assignments.
1:9:58|1:10:25|Standing at a high place, [Liu Shufen] can't afford to hope for her husband's attention now. She carefully and quickly flips through several thick exercise books. Suddenly, her movements slowed down, as if she had found what she was looking for in one of the exercise books in her hand. After confirming it repeatedly, she revealed a sinister smile. She immediately confronted her husband, pointing to the exercise book for him to see.
1:10:38|1:10:43|At this moment, [Liu Shufen] was convinced that the owner of this notebook was the one who wrote the warning letter.
1:10:43|1:11:8|Xu Bochang's expression was somewhat complicated. Involuntarily, he flipped the notebook to the cover and saw the name "Wang Minjia" written prominently. The scene shifted to Wang Minjia, who was unaware of being discovered, arriving at Chen Peng's dormitory. As she turned around with her long braided hair swaying, Chen Peng was standing at the dormitory door looking at her. Wang Minjia, watching Chen Peng tidying up his clothes absentmindedly, asked,
1:11:12|1:11:18|[Chen Peng] still remained silent, quietly putting the intricately carved small flower on the table into his backpack.
1:11:50|1:12:15|[Chen Peng], who was packing his luggage, froze in his movements. He asked, looking at the girl who seemed no different from usual, with a somewhat serious expression on his face. He straightened up and asked again. Seeing the still innocent [Wang Minjia] across from him, [Chen Peng] smiled slightly, nodded gently, and pondered how to explain to her.
1:12:30|1:12:49|Running one after the other on the campus lawn, in such a closed-off era, scenes like this were rare even on campus. The two of them attracted the attention of classmates and passersby as they ran, [Chen Peng] couldn't hear, he couldn't hear those quiet criticisms, all he could hear in his ears was the howling wind and the surging of hot blood.
1:12:49|1:13:9|Despite the gentle gasping of the girl, the two inadvertently found themselves in the formation for gymnastics, and were signaled to leave by the teacher blowing the whistle. Even though they were surrounded by the crowd, even though they were coldly driven away by others, [Chen Peng] did not stop his frantic pace, and was unwilling to let go of the delicate wrist of the girl.
1:13:9|1:13:28|He continued to run with the girl, entering the alley outside the school, passing through the two groups of small hooligans confronting each other. In the scorching summer, the long run made the girl sweaty. Several malicious hooligans rode their bikes to catch up with them and started to get physical. [Chen Peng] stood in front of the girl with his arms outstretched, scaring off the hooligans.
1:13:33|1:13:41|Running to the outskirts far from the campus and the city, they collapsed and sat on the ground outside a construction site.
1:14:1|1:14:8|[Chen Peng] spoke seriously, and [Wang Minjia] also felt a hint of affection.
1:14:34|1:14:39|Wang Minjia, who had just returned from the Tsinghua campus, was stopped by Li Xiang.
1:14:57|1:15:13|[Liu Shufen] brought her best friends to the hospital and confronted the nurse manager and the head nurse in the meeting room. [Wang Minjia] had to admit her actions and faced the criticism from her colleagues as she spoke up.
1:15:36|1:15:55|Upon hearing the head nurse's question, [Wang Minjia] couldn't help but look towards Li Xiang, sensing his avoidance. Disappointed and stubbornly, [Wang Minjia] said, "The letter was written by me alone."
1:15:57|1:16:23|[Liu Shufen] stared at [Wang Minjia] with a relaxed expression, looking proud and occasionally making sarcastic remarks to [Wang Minjia] sitting across the table. As the hustle and bustle of the city passed, [Wang Minjia] returned to the dormitory, tidying up her disheveled hair without caring about the visible palm print on her face. She simply gently held the wrist that had been grabbed by [Chen Peng], with only the morning's mad rush running through her mind.
1:16:23|1:16:43|The entanglement in her eyes was only with the heartfelt smile of [Chen Peng], recalling his obscure and incomprehensible nuclear theory, recalling all along his care for her. [Wang Minjia] vaguely sensed [Chen Peng]'s intentions, she smiled, her thoughts wandering aimlessly.
1:16:47|1:16:57|Following the head nurse, [Wang Minjia] entered the office. As soon as she walked in, everyone put down their work and hurriedly left the office.
1:16:57|1:17:10|The dean tacitly approved of his colleagues' actions. When there were only himself and [Wang Minjia] left in the office, he took out a file folder from the drawer, pulled up a chair, sat across from [Wang Minjia], and asked:
1:17:25|1:17:32|[Wang Minjia] was very nervous, knowing she was in the wrong, so she fell silent.
1:17:56|1:18:15|She could never have imagined that the dean called her in because of these groundless accusations. After some time, the dean led a limping man into the corridor. The female nurse guarding Wang Minjia at the door greeted the dean.
1:18:20|1:18:26|The limping man in work clothes, wearing a duckbill cap, solemnly peered into the window and stared at [Wang Minjia].
1:18:37|1:18:50|Upon hearing the limping man's words, the dean quickly waved his hand to signal Li Xiang to leave. Then he kept [Wang Minjia] hungry until the evening, before finally starting to interrogate her. He opened his notebook, turned to a new page, and began to speak.
1:18:55|1:19:3|He reached into the briefcase at the edge of the table, carefully pulled out a photo album, and opened it before asking [Wang Minjia],
1:19:9|1:19:17|That album belonged to [Wang Minjia], and the photo inside was one she often boasted about - a picture of her with Chairman Mao. She hesitated before speaking:
1:20:17|1:20:22|The limping man pointed to the file, where it said "orphan" under the background section, and continued speaking.
1:20:37|1:20:50|[Wang Minjia] was terrified. She had never imagined that these groundless accusations could bring her such trouble. Trembling all over, she couldn't utter a word and was eventually locked up in solitary confinement.
1:20:50|1:21:24|After a night of torment, the ordeal was far from over. The next day at noon, three nurses escorted [Wang Minjia] to the outdoor movie stage. The square was packed with people ready to watch the movie, all curiously watching the nurses. Meanwhile, [Chen Peng], who was working at a confidential research institute, suddenly felt out of sorts.
1:21:38|1:21:49|After that, he pushed [Wang Minjia] onto the bench.
1:21:59|1:22:6|Running through the crowd of people working on nuclear research, without stopping to greet his busy colleagues in the institute, [Chen Peng] dashed out of the building.
1:22:25|1:22:46|On the other side, [Chen Peng] was anxiously standing on the tractor looking around. Upon hearing the driver's words, [Chen Peng] jumped off the car in a hurry. He squeezed into the crowd that was seeing off the comrades supporting the border, and continued to run forward with difficulty. He weaved through the crowd that was beating gongs, drums, waving flags and shouting slogans, running against the procession. [Chen Peng] became even more anxious.
1:22:46|1:22:52|On the other side, Wang Minjia, who was being criticized, vaguely heard a familiar voice coming from the opposite side.
1:23:20|1:23:30|Separated by just one banner, on one side is the ruthless criticism, on the other side is the impassioned speech.
1:23:51|1:24:2|[Wang Minjia] didn't care that her delicate hair was being cut, she was only focused on listening to the next words from Li Xiang across from her. Li Xiang on stage paused for a moment, then spoke firmly.
1:24:3|1:24:8|Wang Minjia on the bench calmly has her braids cut off, with three thousand green silk strands scattered.
1:24:16|1:24:22|Listening to the applause from the opposite side, watching the ugliness below the stage, innocence dissipates at this moment.
1:24:30|1:24:42|Incited by Liu Shufen, the onlookers were stirred up and cursed as they rushed to the front of the stage. Outside Beijing, Chen Peng seemed to sense something and anxiously knocked on the door of a bus.
1:24:56|1:25:20|Excited people crowded around [Wang Minjia], pushing [Liu Shufen] out of the crowd. Watching the strangers around her, who had nothing to do with [Wang Minjia], yelling and dancing with their fists, as if smashing a piece of rotten meat on someone, [Liu Shufen] remained calm. She shrank back in fear, watching the out-of-control crowd. After a bone-chilling loud noise, the scene was shrouded in darkness.
1:25:20|1:25:26|Following the thunder came the dancing tree branches swaying in the strong wind.
1:25:52|1:26:1|The heavy rain was approaching, and the crowd that had just beaten [Wang Minjia] dispersed. It seemed like the girl lying on the ground, unconscious, was less important than a movie.
1:26:11|1:26:23|In the square, [Liu Shufen] looked at [Wang Minjia]'s bloody body with self-blame and fear, which scared her two friends away from the square directly.
1:26:23|1:26:41|[Liu Shufen] got up numbly, staggered away from the scene, and, across the flower bed, asked a passing old man for directions to no avail. Looking up at the sky for a while, she didn't dare delay any longer and ran into the auditorium.
1:26:41|1:27:11|At this moment, [Chen Peng] ran to the square and saw the girl lying motionless on the ground from a distance. Ignoring rest, he accelerated to [Wang Minjia] and squatted down. Feeling both heartbroken and helpless, [Chen Peng] looked at the girl covered in blood, feeling at a loss for a moment. He struggled to lift her up and held her in his arms. Supporting her head with one hand and pressing on her wrist with the other, [Chen Peng] listened intently for a while. He tightened his grip around [Wang Minjia]'s arm.
1:27:11|1:27:34|Tears silently slid down her cheeks as [Liu Shufen], who was staggering back home, coincidentally met her husband in a narrow alley. As usual, [Xu Bochang] remained silent, with a cold expression on his face, not even realizing his own abnormality. Recalling that just because of her recent impulse, the innocent girl's vibrant life tragically departed from this world.
1:27:34|1:27:50|[Liu Shufen] slightly opened her mouth, as if wanting to confide something to her husband, but the words seemed to get stuck in her throat and turned into the deepest silence. She watched her husband turn his body slightly and walk past her from the side, not sparing her even a tiny bit of touch.
1:27:50|1:27:57|Liu Shufen was instantly overwhelmed with despair, a combination of heartache and self-blame, the two most agonizing emotions that could possibly shatter her spirit.
1:27:57|1:28:11|[Liu Shufen] suddenly left the alley. She didn't know why her husband, who used to be so close to her, had become like this now. But she knew that everything that happened today would once again widen the distance between them.
1:28:13|1:28:23|Her own later life will also forever live under a reality more brutal than [Wang Minjia]. She walked into the courtyard, recalling the past happiness, the smile of her husband.
1:28:23|1:28:32|Deeply engraved in her gaze, she wants to remember and live forever in beautiful memories, without fear or hesitation.
1:29:2|1:29:29|The heavy rain of sorrow arrived, drenching [Xu Bochang] and watering the heartbroken [Chen Peng]. In the desolate outskirts of the city, the shovel was heavy as each scoop of yellow soil piled up. [Chen Peng] felt his hands growing weaker and weaker, the icy rain soaking his clothes, mingling with the tears on his face, masking his sorrow.
1:29:29|1:29:51|[Chen Peng] put down the shovel and approached [Wang Minjia]. The girl leaned quietly against the tree trunk, drenched in rain, looking as if she was asleep, except for the bloodstains all over her body and the wounds on her face, reminding [Chen Peng] of the suppressed and concealed sorrow, which only made his heart ache even more.
1:29:51|1:30:12|He took off his shirt and gently wiped the girl's blurred face, [Chen Peng]'s tenderness was heart-wrenching, mingling with the rain at this moment. With the warmth of his fingers, he poured it bit by bit on the girl, the rain pouring down, the blood stains on the girl's face gradually fading away, the scars exposed in the air.
1:30:12|1:30:36|[Chen Peng] looked at [Wang Minjia] with a face full of concern, but suddenly noticed a slight movement of her lips. He eagerly waited for the icy stimulation of rainwater to soak into [Wang Minjia]'s eyelids and lips. As a glimmer of life returned to the girl, [Wang Minjia] struggled to open her eyes. When she saw [Chen Peng] in front of her, she instinctively tried to show a naive smile.
1:30:37|1:30:43|The pain that filled her body made even the slightest movement excruciating.
1:30:43|1:31:5|She looked around in confusion, her head against the tree trunk, struggling to move. When she saw the pit next to her, [Wang Minjia] forgot about the pain, filled with fear, her chest heaving violently. She had never imagined that one day she would be so close to death, just one turn away, and she had never thought that her fate would be such a neglected one.
1:31:5|1:31:16|The dirty and shabby pit. [Wang Minjia] turned her head and cried in grievance. She knew that from today on, whether she wanted it or not, she would be separated from everything in the past.
1:31:16|1:31:31|Those people and things she had been stubborn, showy, and cared about will all dissipate in the night's rain, just when she feels despair about everything, a warm body will embrace her.
1:31:31|1:31:52|On a rainy night, two lonely souls blend together, giving and seeking the faint warmth from each other, perhaps the only warmth left in this world. The next morning, they bury the pit with yellow soil, and [Wang Minjia] writes her name on the shovel stroke by stroke, burying the past.
1:31:52|1:32:8|In front of the mound, [Chen Peng] set up a simple tombstone, and the two of them then left together. The scene shifts to Kunming Air Force Base, where American military officers are conducting tactical training for a group of students. One officer is holding two airplane models, simulating a dogfight between enemy and friendly aircraft.
1:32:59|1:33:14|In the final tactical class, the American military officer continued to talk about a technique called vertical turn tactics. When our aircraft is exposed in front of the enemy aircraft for too long and cannot escape, the pilot should fly the aircraft straight up into the sky.
1:33:37|1:33:45|As the class came to an end, while all the students were still eating, [Shen Guangyao] was already fully equipped and carrying a variety of food from the cafeteria.
1:33:53|1:34:18|Another soldier told him that it was now difficult for the people outside to have a meal. Shen Guangyao's Mother put down the extra food, pointed to a basket of steamed buns, and said, "The American soldiers can have some." So Shen Guangyao's Mother took out a cloth bag from her pocket, put some steamed buns in it, carried it on her shoulder, walked out of the canteen, and headed towards the airport.
1:34:24|1:34:37|Accompanied by the cheerful shouts of the children and the soothing music, a fighter jet flew over a village, with several eye-catching parachutes floating down like clouds, slowly descending from high above.
1:34:58|1:35:6|Bringing some rare joy to these children. Amidst the children's laughter and play, [Shen Guangyao's Mother] also showed a genuine smile from the heart.
1:35:6|1:35:22|Flying towards the base in a fighter jet, [Shen Guangyao] has been doing everything he can to help those children since he discovered the village and realized he could make a difference.
1:35:22|1:35:38|This was just a routine act of kindness, but he probably didn't realize that his flying skills were steadily improving as he flew back and forth between the base and the village day after day. When he arrived at the base and parked the aircraft, he was waved over by an American military officer.
1:35:44|1:35:48|The officer sat back in his chair, exhaling smoke, watching him from a distance.
1:35:52|1:36:2|When Shen Guangyao finished his push-ups, the officer ordered him to do 50 more. Shen Guangyao hesitated for a moment, then continued in silence as the officer walked down the steps of the wooden house, giving him instructions.
1:36:5|1:36:19|He said that as a pilot, [Shen Guangyao] returning alone each time is both dangerous and foolish behavior. Coming in front of [Shen Guangyao], he squatted down slowly, and the officer told him: even more dangerous is that [Shen Guangyao] flies the same route every time, which is basically inviting the enemy to chase.
1:36:19|1:36:31|The officer asked him if being targeted by the enemy for such a thing was what he had hoped for. [Shen Guangyao] forced himself to stand up straight, paused for a moment, and replied:
1:36:43|1:36:51|In this scene, the military officer's words spoken at a recruitment event were repeated word for word by [Shen Guangyao].
1:36:59|1:37:22|After speaking to the officer, she no longer looked at him, turned and went back to her own wooden house. Outside the dormitory for trainees, soldiers were lining up to take a shower. In the tidy dormitory, [Shen Guangyao] sat cross-legged on the bed reading a telegram from his mother in Guangdong. Accompanied by soft music, his mother's gentle voice echoed in his ears, expressing concern for her son who had joined the military without her knowledge, wondering if studying was hard for him.
1:37:47|1:38:4|[Shen Guangyao] began to prepare for the upcoming first aerial combat, he opened his personal locker, hesitated and took out a cloth bag from it, walking towards the airport.
1:38:58|1:39:12|Under the canopy of the morning sun, the clouds drift and gather, some ethereal, some heavy. The sunlight pours down from the middle, illuminating the land of Yunnan, shining on the rivers and mountains of the motherland. The picturesque beauty seems untouched by war in this splendid scene.
1:39:12|1:39:27|Of course, as a fighter pilot, [Shen Guangyao] knows well that this is just a fantasy and hope bestowed by nature. Coming back to reality, he continues to control the aircraft flying towards the village. The children sitting on the roof excitedly shout as they wait for the plane:
1:39:30|1:39:35|Children in the village shouted and ran out from the rooftops and corners of the houses.
1:39:43|1:40:3|In a thatched cottage, a priest who lost both legs in a Japanese bombing is crawling on the ground using his hands. The sight of his knees dragging his severed legs is horrifying. The cross on his chest shines brightly. With scarce resources, all [Shen Guangyao] can offer the children is a bag of lotus seeds given to him by his mother.
1:40:3|1:40:16|When the snacks full of Shen Guangyao's Mother's deep love for her son were tasted by the children, it seemed that along with the sweetness of rock sugar, those feelings and love were also passed on to the children.
1:40:22|1:40:30|On the plane, [Shen Guangyao] seemed to feel the gaze of the child, avoiding it with some self-blame. Just as he was about to leave,
1:40:35|1:41:0|The children on the ground discovered, pointing at the planes in the sky with their fingers, calling out with their unique endearments. At that moment, the inspiring comrades were finally moved by [Shen Guangyao]'s kindness and perseverance, following him to the village together. Countless parachutes carrying the hopes of the children and the aspirations of the soldiers descended to the ground. The soldiers also experienced the significance of [Shen Guangyao]'s tireless efforts, and they laughed happily.
1:41:0|1:41:5|Forming a formation of airplanes, they flew through the clouds towards the direction of the base.
1:41:7|1:41:28|Back at the base, after rearming, everyone ran towards the fighter jets. Ground crew members were busy loading various types of ammunition into the fighter jets. With the fighter jets ready, all the pilots entered the cockpit. The row of fighter jets were neatly lined up on the runway, exuding a grand momentum. Inside the cockpit, the pilots waved and encouraged each other.
1:41:28|1:41:34|The youthful vigor and strong self-confidence of the young generation in the Republic of China surged in every soldier.
1:41:36|1:41:48|[Shen Guangyao] sat in the cockpit, extended his arm, raised his thumb, and gestured to the nearby American officer. The officer, with a cigar dangling from his mouth, exhaled a puff of smoke and also boldly raised his thumb. The battle was about to begin.
1:41:54|1:42:3|After undergoing numerous rigorous training sessions, Shen Guangyao and his fellow students are finally about to embark on the real battlefield.
1:42:3|1:42:29|For a long time, the suppressed anger is about to be unleashed wildly in a vast land in China. The scene shifts to the early days of the founding of the country on the border of Yunnan. Yunnan at this time is like what [Shen Guangyao] saw in the fighter plane, magnificent and peaceful. The difference is that in today's era, this kind of magnificence is full of meaning, and this peace will endure through the ages.
1:42:29|1:42:51|In the mountainous dirt road, two figures were walking slowly, one in front of the other, it was [Chen Peng] and [Wang Minjia] leaving Beiping. They arrived at a village, where the haphazardly stacked bricks and stones forming the doorway caught [Wang Minjia]'s attention. A lonely cactus was growing on the doorway. [Chen Peng] in the front turned around, smiled, and called out,
1:42:51|1:43:16|He waved to [Wang Minjia], signaling her to follow. As [Wang Minjia] regained her composure, they walked forward together and entered the village. The villagers seemed familiar with [Chen Peng], exchanging greetings in the local dialect. [Chen Peng] appeared relaxed and cheerful, explaining to each inquiring villager that he had returned. He walked towards the center of the village with [Wang Minjia].
1:43:16|1:43:33|On the road, two little girls encountered [Wang Minjia], who was tightly wrapped in cloth. One of the girls, upon hearing [Chen Peng]'s translation, seemed to smile slightly in her only exposed eyes. [Chen Peng] then continued,
1:43:47|1:43:55|The two continued walking and saw [Wang Minjia] looking downcast. [Chen Peng] began to tell the story about this place.
1:44:14|1:44:35|With Chen Peng's words, Shen Guangyao, driving a fighter jet, gradually appeared in the sky. He smiled as he looked down at the ground through the cockpit window, as if locking eyes with Chen Peng who had carried him in his arms decades ago. The gaze between the two generations transcended time and space, and the inheritance of the same school and faith quietly dissipated.
1:44:35|1:44:51|In the midst of children's laughter in the village and the warm greetings of neighbors, [Chen Peng] led [Wang Minjia] into the thatched cottage where he used to live. As night fell, [Wang Minjia] sat in the house, taking off her coat, but her face was still wrapped in cloth.
1:44:52|1:44:58|[Chen Peng] greeted and carried the bedding and oil lamp up the stairs. He placed the items and said:
1:45:13|1:45:20|[Chen Peng] efficiently helped [Wang Minjia] make the bed, then paused before continuing:
1:45:29|1:45:48|[Wang Minjia] turned back with a sense of loss, staring blankly at the burning stove in front of her, and whispered, "Feeling the sadness in [Wang Minjia]'s heart," [Chen Peng] quickly turned around.
1:45:58|1:46:13|[Chen Peng] stopped what he was doing and earnestly shared his thoughts with her. [Wang Minjia] stood up and faced the wall, not wanting to confront [Chen Peng] in her current state. As he approached her, [Chen Peng] said:
1:46:43|1:47:0|Recalling the terrifying past, tears welled up in [Wang Minjia]'s eyes again. She forced herself to endure the twisting pain in her heart, turned away from [Chen Peng], and distanced herself. This time, [Chen Peng] no longer suppressed himself. He rushed up and tightly embraced [Wang Minjia]. In that moment, his tears also fell uncontrollably.
1:47:9|1:47:39|The warm light, the two tightly embraced, chin against each other's shoulders, feeling her trembling, feeling her sincerity, tears from [Wang Minjia] have soaked the veil, the long-suppressed pain is now released without reservation in this moment, she leans on [Chen Peng]'s warm and solid shoulder, as if her past, her everything, has been attached to him.
1:47:39|1:47:42|The man who lifted himself up from the abyss.
1:47:48|1:48:11|He sat on the bed, looking at the room across the way where [Wang Minjia] had the light on. The burning lamp in the room was still gentle, but [Wang Minjia] sitting alone on the bed seemed a bit scared. The quietness of the night, the comfort of the bedding, finally made the exhausted [Wang Minjia] fall asleep. After settling [Wang Minjia], [Chen Peng] hurried back to Beiping to pack his luggage.
1:48:11|1:48:24|The dust settled, everything around was clear to [Chen Peng], making him feel extremely relaxed. Walking on the path of the apricot forest, he stepped on fallen leaves and moved forward, with the warm sunshine shining on his face, [Chen Peng] felt inexplicably comfortable.
1:48:24|1:48:57|In front of [Wang Minjia]'s grave, Li Xiang, with swollen eyes, didn't know how long he had been sad. Watching [Chen Peng] silently approaching him, Li Xiang weakly raised his head to explain. These words made [Chen Peng] suddenly burst into anger. He tackled Li Xiang to the ground and angrily reprimanded his former friend, while Li Xiang furrowed his brow tightly.
1:49:18|1:49:46|[Chen Peng], who was about to leave, stopped in his tracks, looked back at Li Xiang for a moment, then walked up with a serious expression, pulling Li Xiang close to [Wang Minjia]'s grave. The two stood there motionless for a long time. [Chen Peng] said, "After finishing speaking, he took Li Xiang away from this wilderness filled with sadness." In the end, [Chen Peng] chose to bury [Wang Minjia]'s past completely with lies.
1:51:3|1:51:38|With the melancholic melody playing in the background, the scene shifts to the Gobi Desert. After a sharp brake sound, the train comes to a steady stop. Several PLA soldiers open the door of the carriage and carefully help the passengers off the train. [Chen Peng] jumps out of the carriage with his bedding and luggage, anxiously looking around the desolate Gobi, familiarizing himself with the new place where he will work and live.
1:51:38|1:51:50|After everyone had left the carriage, the PLA soldier led the group to walk along the railway track. The facilities in the Gobi Desert were hidden, and the remaining journey had to be completed on foot.
1:51:50|1:52:10|The wind and sand filled the air as everyone walked steadily in the vast Gobi Desert, from day to night, the temperature dropped sharply. In a corner sheltered from the wind and sand, a fire was lit for everyone to rest. Except for the soldiers on guard duty, the rest of the group fell asleep around the fire after a day of trekking.
1:52:10|1:52:35|In a dimly lit room in a village in Yunnan, [Wang Minjia] is washing her scarred face. Every night after [Chen Peng] leaves, she carefully tends to each scar in the quiet of the night, dreaming that one day she can return to her original state and be happy by [Chen Peng]'s side, going wherever she wants to go. She dries her moist face with a towel.
1:52:35|1:53:3|She picked up the snowflake ointment on the cabinet and sat down by the bed, applying the delicate ointment to her face. [Wang Minjia] picked up the long towel by the bed, skillfully folded it on her lap. She seemed to have gotten used to covering up her past and everything at any time in this way, and stubbornly refused to let anyone see her miserable appearance. She gently covered her face with the neatly folded towel, only revealing a pair of eyes.
1:53:3|1:53:15|The room was brightly lit by the fire and oil lamps, gradually dispelling the darkness in her heart. When her face was completely covered, [Wang Minjia] finally settled down in bed.
1:53:15|1:53:39|She has always kept by her bedside the wooden box sent by [Chen Peng], each carefully selected box of snowflake cakes, and the wooden flower hand-carved and painted by [Chen Peng]. As she gently picked up the flower and placed it in her palm, [Wang Minjia] felt the delicate bond that [Chen Peng] had quietly developed towards her, and the slender fingers of the flower were held in [Wang Minjia]'s palm.
1:53:40|1:53:45|The imperfectly carved flower is filled with [Chen Peng]'s unchanging love for himself.
1:53:45|1:54:3|On the other side, [Chen Peng] seemed to feel the longing and affection from his family far away, quietly opening his eyes from his slumber, revealing a happy smile. The flickering light and shadow of the bonfire danced on [Chen Peng]'s face, adding warmth and tranquility to the deep love in his eyes.
1:54:3|1:54:24|Early the next morning, the group continued on their journey. The vast desolation of the Gobi Desert stretched out before them, with only some almost withered vegetation stubbornly rooted in the ground. Dozens of figures moved steadily through the wind-blown sand and gravel, marching towards the rising sun. The group walked in silence, driven only by the belief in their hearts.
1:54:24|1:54:42|For the first time arriving in the Gobi Desert, they seemed to be as resilient and persistent as the vegetation that lived here year-round, heading towards the finish line. After an unknown amount of time, led by the PLA soldiers, the group finally saw a city area from afar, with the faint outline of two helicopters hovering in the sky.
1:54:58|1:55:23|[Shen Guangyao]'s fighter jet was being chased by the enemy, and his comrades informed each other of this information over the radio. Upon receiving the message, nearby comrades quickly came to support. Just as he was aiming and preparing to fire, bullets suddenly poured in from the side and directly destroyed the comrade's aircraft.
1:55:23|1:55:36|Following closely, another one of our planes had its wing shot off by the Japanese, losing power and plummeting rapidly towards the ground. The overloaded engine exploded in mid-air, shattering the aircraft into countless pieces.
1:55:44|1:55:56|Shen Guangyao's face was extremely serious as he continuously received distress signals from his American comrades on the radio. In the cockpit, heavy rain started falling in the remote village of Yunnan.
1:57:53|1:58:3|Japanese warplanes opened fire first, bullets pierced the cockpit, blood dripping on [Shen Guangyao], [Shen Guangyao] continued to drive regardless.
1:58:12|1:58:33|The fighter jets exploded in the air, and just as [Shen Guangyao] let out a sigh of relief, the distress calls from his other squadron comrades on the radio pulled him back into the cruel reality. Looking down through the damaged cockpit glass, [Shen Guangyao] saw one after another of his comrades' planes crashing, with parachutes slowly drifting down in the air becoming live targets for the Japanese troops on the ground, and Japanese warships on the river below.
1:58:52|1:59:18|Seeing their comrades sacrificing one by one in front of them, [Shen Guangyao] showed a determined expression. He pushed the control stick to the bottom fiercely, causing the originally parallel flying aircraft to change direction and dive towards the river. After stabilizing the direction, [Shen Guangyao] let go of the control stick and sat despondently in the cockpit, facing beside him.
1:59:18|1:59:23|Smiling comrades drifting with parachutes, he shed tears and softly told [Shen Guangyao's Mother] that he was sorry.
1:59:32|1:59:46|In the air, the comrade-in-arms watched as [Shen Guangyao] piloted the fighter jet and slammed it fiercely onto the enemy warship. The two massive objects, linked explosions, made the entire river surface extremely hot. The screen went dark, and a few lines of text appeared.
1:59:46|2:0:13|In May 1943, during the Battle of West Hubei, the Chinese Air Force mobilized all available forces and, together with the U.S. Army, shot down 31 enemy planes, destroyed 6 enemy planes, and bombed and sank 23 enemy ships. When the scene brightened again, they were already in Guangzhou. [Shen Guangyao's Mother] tearfully flipped through the album her son had drawn, which recorded what he had seen and heard at Southwest United University.
2:0:13|2:0:20|The narration records the appearance of the child who died in the brutal bombing of Kunming by the Japanese army, as well as the mother who tightly held the child's arm.
2:0:20|2:0:35|The content of the album became more and more heartbreaking, [Shen Guangyao's Mother] was already in tears, and behind her, [Shen Guangyao's Mother] was also shedding tears. When [Shen Guangyao's Mother] saw the words "Mom, I'm sorry" written in the album, she seemed to really hear her son's voice.
2:1:1|2:1:9|Shen Guangyao's Mother's gaze shifted from the brochure to Mei Yiqi in military uniform, a world apart from before.
2:1:11|2:1:22|After Shen Guangyao's Mother led the servant into the mansion, she soon came out carrying two bowls of lotus seed soup. She walked over to the two children and said:
2:1:26|2:1:46|[Mei Yiqi] and Xiaolin looked at the sweet lotus seeds in the tray, couldn't help but think of the time they spent together with [Shen Guangyao] in college. The two brothers picked up the porcelain plate and took a sip, savoring the sweetness in the water and the past happiness. Then they both took a step back, knelt down on the ground, and respectfully kowtowed to [Shen Guangyao's Mother].
2:1:48|2:1:58|[Shen Guangyao's Mother] murmured softly, quickly bent down, and supported the two of them by holding their arms, showing deep affection. Mei Yiqi and Xiaolin couldn't help but shed tears at such a heartfelt moment.
2:1:58|2:2:17|The two bid farewell in a hurry and left the Shen family mansion. Shen Guangyao's Mother watched from afar, seeing them off. Behind him, the pillars and plaques of the mansion were inscribed with the grand words "Three generations, five generals, guarding the country's borders, leaving a legacy of righteousness in history, mastering the Six Secret Teachings and Three Strategies, skilled in border defense tactics, praised by the imperial decree as heroes."
2:2:17|2:2:26|On the signboard in the middle, the square characters read "Three Generations, Five Heroes." The scene shifts to a flyover in Beijing city.
2:2:51|2:3:16|The father and son took the wet wipes and snacks handed over by [Shen Guangyao's Mother] in the back seat, glanced at the unopened items in the car, and [Shen Guangyao's Mother] patted her husband's shoulder reassuringly. The scene shifted to a few people arriving at the cemetery, where the father placed several chrysanthemums in front of a tombstone engraved with the name Li Xiang, with a young photo of Li Xiang attached on top.
2:4:20|2:4:32|Zhang Guoguo listened to her father's words thoughtfully. After the family paid their respects to Li Xiang together, she returned to the office and felt a bit awkward looking at the quadruplets in front of her aunt. [Zhang Guoguo] spoke first:
2:4:34|2:4:48|He opened several file bags on the table and handed them to the woman in front of him, then said, "The woman gratefully glanced at [Zhang Guoguo] and then lowered her head to flip through the documents."
2:5:10|2:5:41|The woman was so moved by the stack of business cards handed to her by [Zhang Guoguo] that she couldn't speak. She pursed her lips, took out a wooden box from her bag, and slowly spoke with a trembling voice. [Zhang Guoguo] quickly opened the box to find four dolls and four fetal hair brushes inside. Seeing the four deluxe fetal hair brushes in the box, [Zhang Guoguo] felt a bit guilty. He smiled and said:
2:5:41|2:5:59|Caressing the wooden box, he couldn't help but feel a deep sense of guilt, thinking that he had once treated the quadruplets and their family as ungrateful people, as [Robert] had said. At night, [Zhang Guoguo] was still sitting at the desk, holding the phone and finally dialed that number.
2:6:11|2:6:17|After rejecting Robert, Zhang Guoguo seemed to still be immersed in deep self-blame for misunderstanding others.
2:6:33|2:6:39|On October 16, 1964, China successfully conducted its first nuclear bomb test.
2:6:54|2:7:17|On the train, [Chen Peng] in work clothes listened contentedly to the discussions of the passengers around him. As he bent down to pick up a water cup, the steward accidentally spilled water on [Chen Peng]'s hat. Taking off the hat to inspect, it revealed that [Chen Peng]'s once thick hair had become quite sparse. Inside the hat lining and even on his shoulders, strands of fallen hair were entwined.
2:7:17|2:7:36|Needless to say, in recent years, it was [Chen Peng] and a group of researchers working day and night in Qinghai that enabled our country to successfully test the first atomic bomb. Probably due to the lack of resources, the researchers lacked strong protective gear. In a large number of experiments, they were more or less exposed to radiation, leading to the roots of illness.
2:7:36|2:7:48|[Chen Peng], regardless of his own physical condition, boarded the train to Yunnan immediately after finishing work, filled with joy to return to the border town where [Wang Minjia] lived.
2:7:48|2:8:4|When he walked into the village, he found that everything had changed. The once lively village was now deserted, with not a single person in sight. The villagers had all left for unknown reasons, leaving the village eerily quiet, devoid of its usual signs of life.
2:8:4|2:8:13|[Wang Minjia] was naturally nowhere to be found, [Chen Peng] couldn't believe it. He hurried through the cluttered village streets, rushing to [Wang Minjia]'s thatched hut, only to see a mess of scattered items.
2:8:15|2:8:27|Walking along the abandoned railway track in the desolate Gobi Desert, [Wang Minjia] wrapped in a long scarf, her gaze determined.
2:8:54|2:9:8|The scene fades away from [Wang Minjia]'s weak but determined gaze. Time travels to the nursery, where [Zhang Guoguo] carefully paints beautiful patterns on the window glass for the four children.
2:9:21|2:9:38|Zhang Guoguo's reflections connect all the stories together, while Wu Linglan contemplates life.
2:9:48|2:9:55|The patriotic feelings of [Shen Guangyao] and the love story of [Chen Peng] seem unrelated, but they are connected at this moment.
2:10:1|2:10:8|[Zhang Guoguo] came to the side of the crib, smiling as he looked at the babies with eyes full of love.
2:11:0|2:11:20|At the end of the film, images of real historical figures appear on the screen, who were outstanding students from Tsinghua University or teachers and professors working there.
2:11:20|2:11:43|[Mei Yiqi], 34 years old in 1923, was the director of the Academic Affairs Office of Tsinghua School at the time.
