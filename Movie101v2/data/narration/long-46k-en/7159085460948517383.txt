0:0:47|0:0:54|The eagle soared across the sky, accompanied by a strong and powerful cry. After years of silence, [Yue Feng] with a determined look in his eyes, moved forward slowly.
0:0:57|0:1:22|He emerged from the darkness, finally stopping in a patch of light, his gaze complex and determined, filled with anger, hatred, and aspirations waiting to be fulfilled. He seemed trapped in a small space yet also floating in the universe. Accompanied by a powerful and urgent music, a mysterious young man strode with determination, leading us towards the field.
0:1:24|0:1:47|In the stadium, more than 20 people were already standing, each carrying sticks and weapons, moving their heads and stretching their muscles, but unable to hide their panic in their expressions. And this mysterious young man, bare-handed, with a look of aggression in his eyes, walked into the field with the spirit of heading to the battlefield, heading towards the crowd.
0:1:50|0:2:1|Seeing the mysterious teenager approaching aggressively, a group of people on the field also moved forward. As the mysterious teenager stood still, a gunshot rang out, revealing his name.
0:2:6|0:2:9|He asked the leading teenager on the other side.
0:2:17|0:2:37|At the command of the top scholar, a dozen little brothers on the opposite side immediately swarmed towards [Yue Feng], brandishing their clubs to strike. [Yue Feng], not one to be trifled with, quickly identified the approaching hooligans and effortlessly took down the surrounding enemies with just a few moves.
0:2:37|0:2:44|From the side, a burly man tried to sneak attack [Yue Feng] while he was off guard, but was instead lifted up by [Yue Feng] and slammed heavily onto the ground.
0:2:45|0:3:4|[Yue Feng] executed over a dozen moves, each one precise and without any unnecessary actions. With each punch and kick, he took down an opponent. The lackeys were not giving up, cautiously testing him one by one. A boy in a tracksuit aimed a blow towards the man, targeting [Yue Feng]'s head.
0:3:4|0:3:10|[Yue Feng] snatched the weapon from the boy's hand and gave a kick to the person behind him who was about to attack.
0:3:12|0:3:33|A punch landed on the boy's face, leaving him dazed and falling to the ground. Despite his strong martial arts skills, [Yue Feng] couldn't avoid being attacked by the group of people one after another. Three men joined forces to knock [Yue Feng] down, and as he got up, he was held back, while the leading young man pushed his face towards [Yue Feng].
0:3:34|0:3:50|[Yue Feng] immediately got up and threw the leading teenager away. The fight continued, and when the leading teenager was heartlessly thrown away, the others formed a formation and joined the battle together. With the determined teenager leading a few brothers, they rushed up and tripped [Yue Feng] down.
0:3:50|0:3:55|The other six quickly grabbed [Yue Feng] by his limbs and dragged him towards the center of the field.
0:4:3|0:4:19|After escaping, [Yue Feng] climbed up along the fence of the field, but was soon surrounded by the crowd and unable to escape successfully. Overwhelmed, [Yue Feng] was forced into a dead end, surrounded by the crowd, and was hit by heavy fists and sticks.
0:4:26|0:4:40|Others quickly made way, clearing a space. The young man with the stick raised it high, ready to strike heavily. The outcome of the confrontation was unknown. The blow rendered [Yue Feng] unconscious, leading him to prison and also giving the film its title.
0:4:41|0:4:46|The king of the street, four big words, the story unfolds in a mysterious and confusing manner.
0:4:56|0:5:15|[Yue Feng] bent down and nodded farewell to the prison guard. After that, he raised his head in a daze, looking at the somewhat unfamiliar sky outside the prison. The fleeting sense of youthful righteousness was hidden in his eyes. The years had smoothed out his hostility and sharpness, replaced by the moistness in his eyes.
0:5:15|0:5:32|After leaving prison, [Yue Feng] set out on his own to start a new life. Passing through two rows of tall trees, through the bustling streets, he entered a hutong and curiously looked around at the surroundings. Stepping into a small restaurant, the landlady asked him.
0:5:35|0:5:46|Hearing the sound, Kai Zi suddenly turned around from behind the shelf and walked forward in surprise to confirm. The two embraced excitedly, and Kai Zi looked at [Yue Feng] with many questions in mind.
0:5:49|0:6:12|The landlady interrupted with tea. Kai Zi introduced excitedly, but his wife pushed his hand away. Kai Zi could only smile awkwardly, while [Yue Feng] lowered his eyes. Kai Zi poured tea and apologized for his wife, [Yue Feng] shook his head helplessly, smiling more ugly than crying, Kai Zi quickly comforted him.
0:6:31|0:6:37|The wife played with the cup in her hand and then left, catching the attention of the two men.
0:6:40|0:6:46|Kaizi stood up to comfort his wife, while [Yue Feng] could only stand by with a forced smile.
0:7:7|0:7:26|Accompanied by the sound of a breaking cup, the seat was empty. [Yue Feng] had quietly left, wandering aimlessly. The city was bustling with traffic and people, everyone going about their lives in an orderly manner. The bus window reflected [Yue Feng]'s face, looking lost and confused.
0:7:29|0:7:54|No one could tell [Yue Feng] where to go, but he understood that the road ahead was long and he could only rely on himself. As the traffic flowed into the night, darkness fell. Today, with a weary body, he walked through the platforms, overpasses, and streets, accompanied by moonlight and neon lights to the pedestrian street.
0:7:54|0:8:15|On the big screen in the pedestrian street, he saw the unrecognizable woman, adding a terrifying atmosphere to this unfamiliar city. Looking at the people coming and going around, everyone was in a hurry, walking quickly, and no one was willing to stop their forward steps.
0:8:15|0:8:23|Yue Feng stood still for a moment, confused and at a loss, unable to find a direction but unable to stop searching.
0:8:27|0:8:34|Homeless [Yue Feng] is still searching, still wandering, his steps getting heavier and his body more exhausted.
0:8:36|0:8:43|[Yue Feng] accidentally arrived at a deserted construction site at night, continuing to search for a place to settle down for the night.
0:8:43|0:9:3|After countless disappointments, he finally found a spacious bare room and decided to take a rest there. He neatly arranged the straw in the corner, lay down peacefully, covered himself with the extra straw, and gradually fell asleep, having his first peaceful sleep after a bath.
0:9:6|0:9:28|The sun rises in the east, casting its first light. Facing the morning dew, [Yue Feng] practices on the rooftop. With bent legs, punches, and kicks, his movements are powerful and vigorous. Between each punch and kick, [Yue Feng] gradually rediscovers the feeling of his past training, increasing his agility and speed. With a swift kick, his posture is perfect, resembling [Bruce Lee].
0:9:28|0:9:34|Xiao Feng confidently danced, soothing Yue Feng's emotions, as the morning sun transitioned from dim to bright.
0:9:35|0:9:42|After finishing his training, [Yue Feng] sat on the rooftop, gazing into the distance, secretly determined to come to the construction site to seek opportunities.
0:10:2|0:10:15|[Yue Feng] eagerly awaited, only to receive bad news. He pretended to be strong. The words of the foreman were like a sledgehammer on a construction site, weighing heavily on [Yue Feng]'s heart. He walked away with a lonely figure.
0:10:28|0:10:44|Soon, the thieves ran into a complex alleyway. Suddenly changing direction, the beauty slammed on the brakes and charged into the alley where the thieves were hiding. The thieves mesmerized the beauty, blocking her way out, and leered at her with ill intentions.
0:10:49|0:10:54|Speak up, or touch the face of a beauty, the beauty punches, but the power difference is too great.
0:10:58|0:11:13|Xiao Yi and the others showed no signs of remorse. The beauty kicked and resisted, but her head was attacked, causing her to lose consciousness and faint. She couldn't remember what happened while she was unconscious. When she woke up groggily, she found herself facing a handsome man.
0:11:16|0:11:22|The man is Yue Feng, he did not answer, and walked out of the alley with the water.
0:11:42|0:11:48|Immediately after, at the edge of the Five Caves, two workers were using ropes to hoist furniture while a child was playing with a ball.
0:12:20|0:12:28|Coincidentally, the child's ball flew over and landed under the furniture, where it was in a dangerous position.
0:12:36|0:12:45|The rope broke, the heavy furniture rushed towards and fell down, at this moment, Yue Feng appeared, saved the child, and carried the child to the side, comforting him/her all over.
0:13:6|0:13:8|Took Yue Feng to the company warehouse without hesitation.
0:13:17|0:13:30|After Pillow left, [Yue Feng] cautiously entered the warehouse, straightened his body, and greeted the new work with enthusiasm. As night fell, [Yue Feng] fell asleep exhausted, dreaming back to the actions before he was imprisoned.
0:13:33|0:13:39|His mouth full of blood, he was hit hard on the head, and [Yue Feng] suddenly woke up from the nightmare.
0:13:44|0:14:2|[Yue Feng] got up and recalled the details of the duel years ago. He was surrounded and beaten by a group of people, so he got up to practice martial arts, determined not to let such an opportunity happen again. [Yue Feng] had not yet emerged from the state of being obsessed with sleep, he could still feel that inexplicable unease.
0:14:3|0:14:24|He kept doing push-ups and getting up, trying to make himself stronger through training. The dangerous villa somewhat limited his punches and kicks, causing him some injuries, so he swung his arms faster to increase the speed of his punches. Even when his back was against the wall, he didn't stop using swift offensive and defensive moves.
0:14:24|0:14:28|Under the guidance of Master Han, he finally could sense the best state of the battle from years ago with just one glance.
0:14:33|0:14:52|Yue Feng's punching speed becomes faster and the strength increases, protecting the formation of the morning sun. In the blink of an eye, it's time for work, and [Yue Feng] arrives at the office on time. Unexpectedly, [Xiao Yi] and [Huang Mao] are already there.
0:15:10|0:15:12|[Yue Feng] sized up the thin-lipped man.
0:15:26|0:15:35|The two looked at [Yue Feng] with no response, becoming anxious. [The fat guy] was beaten so badly that he became arrogant, [Yue Feng] asked, and [the fat guy] was stunned.
0:15:52|0:15:57|The Skinny guy reached out for the Fat guy's button, but the Fat guy quickly waved his hand and stood up.
0:16:39|0:17:4|[Fatty] patted [Yue Feng] on the back, then raised his hand, signaling to [Skinny]. [Skinny] immediately understood and said, "Alright, let's kick and push [Yue Feng] away." After work, [Yue Feng] held a crumpled note and followed it to a quiet street.
0:17:4|0:17:22|He looked around, his gaze finally settling on a small stall selling pancakes. The seller was an old granny, her eyes full of wounds, her face filled with the bitterness of life. [Yue Feng] walked to the side, silently watching the old granny's stall.
0:17:22|0:17:27|Upon his release from prison, the prison guard had instructed [Yue Feng] to take the address he had given him, and [Yue Feng] fulfilled his promise.
0:17:39|0:17:53|The grandmother of the boy he killed was found. Melancholic music drifted from afar, as it turned out to be Kaizi playing the harmonica alone in the shop, reminiscing about childhood memories filled with reluctance and sorrow.
0:17:54|0:18:15|The melodious harmonica sound accompanied the footsteps of the teenagers, running away from their childhood. Teenager Kaizi punched and kicked the bad kids, forcing them into a corner, bending his knees and hugging his body tightly. Two teenagers arrived in time to kick away the bullies. These two were the brave [Yue Feng] and [A Hai] who stood up for justice in their youth.
0:18:16|0:18:25|Three young men formed a deep bond that would last a lifetime, but as they grew older, their paths began to diverge.
0:18:29|0:18:33|As dusk fell, [Yue Feng] bought a large bag of pancakes from Pancake Granny.
0:18:34|0:18:52|Upon returning home, his attention was immediately drawn to the harmonica and envelope on the table. [Yue Feng] recognized them as Kai's harmonica and the envelope with Kai's handwritten name beside it. He opened the envelope and found a tower of coins inside, along with a childhood photo of three young boys tucked deep inside.
0:18:53|0:19:13|In the photo, the three people are close together, still with the innocent face of youth. Now, everything has changed, and [Yue Feng] feels a sense of regret. With a sense of melancholy, he picks up his harmonica, walks slowly to the window, looks up at the moon, and under the moonlight's gaze, [Yue Feng]'s thoughts return to his childhood with the harmonica.
0:19:13|0:19:17|In childhood, Kaizi also played the harmonica alone like [Yue Feng].
0:19:18|0:19:34|But unlike in the past, the three young men used to be companions, protecting each other. Now, Kaizi sits alone in the shop drinking, the cigarette still burning, the stories of youth already told. They have all gone their separate ways, each one alone.
0:20:41|0:21:1|In the previous year, full of spirit, jokingly said, imitating a movie scene, bumped fists, with a train roaring past behind, and a moving company's truck speeding by, forming a line, outlining the appearance of youth fading away. [Yue Feng] and two others are moving goods.
0:21:13|0:21:36|The fat guy struggled to move the computer, calling out for [Yue Feng]. Unexpectedly, even with the help of the skinny guy, they couldn't move the computer, but [Yue Feng] managed to carry it away by himself. As [Yue Feng] carried the computer, upon entering the shelter, his eyes were immediately drawn to the scene in front of him, becoming mesmerized and standing still.
0:21:39|0:21:58|The scene shows several adorable children playing, running and jumping around. Two of them are playfully chasing each other in the courtyard. The energetic children make Yue Feng feel warm and familiar, as if he and A Hai were like that in the past.
0:21:58|0:22:2|[Yue Feng] was momentarily stunned, lost in thought and immersed in memories.
0:22:10|0:22:33|[Yue Feng] was brought back to reality by the fat man's call and continued to move the computer. At this moment, only the fat man and the thin man were in the room. The thin man placed the computer on the ground, and the fat man reminded him. As the thin man lifted the computer case, outside the window, a long-haired beauty stood up. A loud noise caught the attention of the beauty, causing the thin man to accidentally drop the computer.
0:22:37|0:22:48|After the fat guy finished cursing, he looked around thinking no one was there, not realizing the beauty had witnessed the whole thing and left. The two looked at the smashed computer, walked out of the room, and called out to [Yue Feng].
0:22:55|0:23:18|Speak up, the fat guy and the skinny guy walked out, [Yue Feng] noticed the fat guy's unusual expression, but didn't think much of it, and went into the room alone. As soon as he lifted the computer box from the ground, the computer inside fell out of the cardboard box and crashed heavily on the ground. The skinny guy and the fat guy, who came running at the sound, looked very surprised.
0:23:18|0:23:21|The fat guy and the skinny guy are investigating outside the door, and the boss comes in.
0:23:26|0:23:48|[Yue Feng] stood still, saying nothing. The beauty entered the room to break the deadlock. She looked at the ringleader, then had dinner with [Yue Feng]. [Yue Feng] recognized that she was the girl he had saved.
0:24:14|0:24:23|This is a private shelter. Mr. Zhou, who has no children of his own, originally only took in two children. The beauty shyly lowered her head and played with the coffee.
0:24:52|0:24:58|The beauty shyly looked at [Yue Feng], but the subtle atmosphere was interrupted by the ringing of the phone.
0:25:15|0:25:18|[Yue Feng] hung up the phone and then calmly looked at the beautiful woman.
0:25:28|0:25:45|The beauty borrowed Yue Feng's phone, leaving her phone number and only returning the phone after confirming the call. Yue Feng took the phone, responded, and left. In the billiard room, the fat guy and the skinny guy were scolded by the bald man.
0:26:42|0:26:48|Bald Xing came to the next door excitedly, only to see [Yue Feng] empty-handed, with a disappointed look on his face.
0:26:56|0:27:15|Yue Feng was hit on the head by anger and a bottle. Blood flowed from the top of his head. Baldy grabbed an empty bottle and smashed it on Yue Feng's head. Yue Feng spat and kicked Baldy to the ground. Wu stared at Baldy, and in an instant, the bottle was crushed by Yue Feng.
0:27:15|0:27:23|He asked coldly, the bald guy was so scared that he couldn't speak, the fat guy was taken away from the pool hall by the skinny guy and [Yue Feng].
0:27:43|0:27:59|The bright moon hangs high in the sky, and after a tiring day, [Yue Feng] has already peacefully entered dreamland. However, he is awakened by the piercing ringtone of his phone. Turning on the night light, [Yue Feng] picks up his phone and reads a text message sent by the beauty in the afternoon.
0:28:5|0:28:28|After reading the text message, [Yue Feng] replied: Only then did he notice the name left by the beauty - [Xiao Yi]. He readily agreed, but then felt uneasy. Remembering the mistakes he made when he was young, [Yue Feng] still felt guilty. It turned out that the young troublemaker who wanted to be his apprentice back then was stopped by [Yue Feng].
0:28:31|0:28:38|He then learned his own kind tricks, using one hand to wield a weapon and kicking the enemy.
0:28:46|0:28:56|After the life-and-death struggle with Milo, Yue Feng's energy was only half consumed. The little Kun tigers launched an attack, and A Hai couldn't hold them back at the bottom of the stairs.
0:28:58|0:29:9|After the Communist Party's rectification meeting, the strategy was adjusted to surround [Yue Feng]. His shadow was like a solitary island, even though the people around him were surrounded by others, it still appeared fierce.
0:29:10|0:29:34|The people around were scared with chapped lips. The leader, Xiao Yi, gave the order, and other little souls flew up one after another, trying to attack [Yue Feng]. [Yue Feng] counterattacked and defeated one person. [Yue Feng] didn't expect that the young master would sneak attack him from behind.
0:29:39|0:29:50|Yue Feng was asked to lift up the heart that was about to fall, and he also held Yue Yue's hands with both hands and lifted them up. As soon as he lifted them up, it caused the sniper to insert into Yue's body.
0:29:55|0:30:20|In the exclamation of the leading teenager, [Yue Feng] stood still, fear, confusion, astonishment, and worry flashing in his eyes. He stared at the teenager on the ground, looking at the motionless person beside the teenager. He witnessed the terror of his own fist for the first time, memories dissipating like a nightmare, unable to fall asleep for a long time.
0:30:20|0:30:30|The next day, [Yue Feng] arrived early at the shelter, sitting on the playground, watching the children in front of him. Xiao Yi came out and sat beside him.
0:30:57|0:31:7|A little boy walked over holding a painting, [Yue Feng] took the painting, reached out to touch the boy's face, and asked. His name is Xiao Qiang, a deaf-mute child.
0:31:8|0:31:22|[Yue Feng] lowered his head apologetically, admiring the boy's painting. With the innocent strokes, the painting depicted a happy family of three. In the painting, the little boy was holding hands with his parents, which captivated [Yue Feng] and reminded him of his own father.
0:32:28|0:32:42|The father threw the hot water pot and also brought [Yue Feng] back to reality, leaving his heart unsettled for a long time. The loud noises shattered the tranquility of the shelter, and Auntie stood up to stop the aggressive men.
0:32:45|0:32:50|The leading strong man stared fiercely at Xiao Yi, and the principal walked out.
0:32:52|0:33:10|The burly men then swaggered into the inner room one by one, looking fierce and menacing, while giving Xiao Yi a flirtatious glare. Xiao Yi ignored them. Once inside, one of the men in a floral jacket said to the principal,
0:33:26|0:33:30|The leader stopped the strong man's fist, walked slowly towards him, and said,
0:33:47|0:34:7|As they were leaving, the leader glanced at [Yue Feng], a hint of disdain flashing in his eyes before quickly lowering his eyelids. Xiao Yi watched the burly men leave and then ran up to ask the headmaster. Watching the burly men walk away outside the window, the headmaster sighed, took off his glasses, and nodded helplessly.
0:34:36|0:34:53|Speak up, he lowered his eyes, the three of them showing endless worries in their eyes. As night fell, an Audi with a red logo swayed and rushed towards the old lady crossing the road. On the other side of the road, [Yue Feng] took a big step and crossed, considering the old lady, causing the car to stop abruptly.
0:34:53|0:35:1|After speaking, Yue Feng left, leaving the auntie and the Audi owner standing there. The drunk Audi owner got out from under the car door and asked.
0:35:7|0:35:29|[Yue Feng] walked through the dark alley, and under a tree, a familiar figure was waiting for him. [A Hai] leaned against the tree, unable to contain his anticipation and joy, which made the long-lost brothers speechless. Countless words turned into familiar fist bumps, and the joy turned into the steam rising from the hotpot.
0:35:29|0:35:31|The brothers met in the hotpot restaurant to catch up.
0:35:37|0:35:42|[A Hai] took a deep breath, as if making a firm decision.
0:36:30|0:36:58|The silent two contrasted with the boiling sound of the hotpot, their lives completely different. They clinked glasses as the hotpot boiled. After a full meal and plenty of drinks, the two drunkenly supported each other as they stumbled out of the restaurant. [A Hai] escorted [Yue Feng] to the door, hailed a taxi.
0:37:0|0:37:17|The taxi stopped by the roadside, and the two held hands to bid farewell. [A Hai] opened the car door, and as [Yue Feng] leaned in to see the driver's face, he was stunned. The driver frowned upon recognizing him, stepped on the gas pedal, and drove off before [Yue Feng] could react, leaving him far behind.
0:37:17|0:37:33|[A Hai] shouted discontentedly, the driver followed the path and saw [Yue Feng] standing still, a complex emotion flashed through his heart, and he continued to drive forward indifferently. The next morning, [Yue Feng] as usual, came to the pancake stall to take care of the old lady's business.
0:38:22|0:38:29|Yue Feng bent down as Granny Fang placed the stool on the cart, saying, "Come on, let's pull the cart together and move forward."
0:38:44|0:38:49|The old volunteer fainted upon seeing the bloody animal head at the door, and everyone rushed to the hospital.
0:39:17|0:39:46|Xiao Yi felt sorry. I see, said [Yue Feng], lowering his head in contemplation, his gaze following along the ward. The principal stood in front of the hospital bed, rubbing his eyes with a worried expression. This scene prompted [Yue Feng] to make a firm decision in his heart. On the other side, the Shao Dong family was still plotting their acquisition plan.
0:40:10|0:40:15|Yue Feng's eyes were filled with unfathomable desire as he swayed his wine glass, then he spoke slowly.
0:40:21|0:40:27|Henchman [A Long] remained expressionless, while the young master smoked a cigar and changed the subject. With a plan in mind, [A Long] nodded in response.
0:40:48|0:41:15|[A Long] immediately took people to the shelter, sneaked into the night, smashed the glass, and comforted the children. The headmaster hurried over to comfort them, carried the children into the house, and the children swarmed around the headmaster.
0:41:25|0:41:34|The children were wrapped in a big blanket by the headmaster and fell asleep peacefully. The next day, [Yue Feng] and the headmaster cleaned up the mess, while [Xiao Yi] comforted the children.
0:42:0|0:42:20|The round-footed man who kicked the leg of the man who crashed into him, [Xiao Yi], took the gas and smashed it towards the man who crashed into him, with a huge power difference. [Yue Feng] witnessed everything in the room. [Yue Feng], with a murderous intent he had never shown since his release from prison, walked towards the men who crashed into him and said:
0:42:24|0:42:43|[Yue Feng] spat out, kicked away the first step, reflected the strong man, and continuously blocked others from approaching, but was knocked down by [Yue Feng]'s fast whirlwind ladder kick. The strong men were stunned. The leader in the floral jacket, a strong man, continued to attack alongside the others. The strong man displayed a set of fancy boxing and kicking techniques.
0:42:45|0:43:6|The viewers were dazzled, and finally someone picked up a brick, only to be kicked back underground by [Yue Feng]. The man in a flowery jacket, unwilling to show weakness, rushed forward with a stick, but [Yue Feng] punched him and left him struggling to stand. The burly man fled in panic, and the shelter returned to its former calm.
0:43:38|0:43:43|The principal earnestly entrusted the two of them, with [Duan Hanqiang] practicing martial arts.
0:44:26|0:44:43|The burly man in a floral jacket just left, and the bald man walked over. [A Long] approached and whispered to the bald man, patting his shoulder trustingly. They entered the police station and went to the underground garage, where [Yue Feng] and [Xiao Yi] were.
0:44:55|0:45:3|[Xiao Yi] opened the door, [Yue Feng] put down his things, but didn't get in the car.
0:45:23|0:45:42|[Yue Feng] saw through the car window that two people were sneaking around the car opposite. He immediately became alert, coaxing [Xiao Yi] into the car in a gentle voice. However, [Xiao Yi], who was full of anticipation, was knocked unconscious from behind by [Yue Feng] and fell into the car.
0:45:42|0:45:48|Yue Feng carefully laid Xiao Yi in the car, then stood up and faced the thugs hiding in the dark.
0:45:49|0:46:7|About ten people approached, fully armed, their faces obscured. They all held sharp blades, masked and armed with knives, surrounding [Yue Feng]. The battle officially began, with one thug rushing towards [Yue Feng] with a short knife. [Yue Feng] acted swiftly, grabbing the thug's blade hand and swiftly knocking him down.
0:46:9|0:46:18|[Sung Dai Fu] repeatedly raised the sword to attack [Yue Feng], taking turns to fight. [Yue Feng] was not willing to give in, dodging the sword multiple times and resisting fiercely.
0:46:20|0:46:26|[Yue Feng] did not notice the sneak attack from the side with a dog knife while confronting the thugs in front of him, and his arm was scratched.
0:46:29|0:46:47|Realizing that fighting off the numerous disciples with bare hands is not a solution, [Yue Feng] had to wait for the right moment, swiftly shot and escaped as the disciples relaxed their guard, running deeper into the garage. The [Father-in-law] clan still refused to give up, chasing after [Yue Feng] downhill, all the way to the iron gate.
0:46:48|0:47:7|[Yue Feng] was forced into a corner, surrounded once again by a group of thugs. As he looked around to assess the situation, he resisted the attackers and noticed an iron chain hanging above the iron gate. In the next moment, [Yue Feng] swung the iron chain, knocking down the group of people and turning the tide.
0:47:7|0:47:17|Yue Feng, Xiao Yi, and A Hai were playing outside the shelter. A little boy was spinning a top, when suddenly two masked men got off a truck and snatched the boy, leaving the top spinning on the ground.
0:47:19|0:47:34|In the aunt's room, [Yue Feng] stayed close to the aunt, biting on gauze and struggling to deal with the large cut on his arm, bandaging the wound on his arm alone. The aunt woke up, feeling worried, and got up to say to [Yue Feng],
0:48:6|0:48:16|[Yue Feng] walked towards the door, and Xiao Yi stood up reluctantly. [Yue Feng] smiled knowingly and said.
0:48:19|0:48:41|[Xiao Yi] nervously bites her lower lip, watching [Yue Feng] leave with reluctance. While waiting at a traffic light, [Yue Feng] sees a boy struggling inside a truck, and upon closer inspection, realizes it's a child from the orphanage. Frantic, [Yue Feng] chases after the truck on foot.
0:48:41|0:48:48|He paid no attention to the crowd or the wheels, solely focused on rescuing the child as quickly as possible. The criminal took the child to a mysterious warehouse.
0:48:55|0:49:9|The child struggled desperately as several men held down his limbs. Just as the villain was about to strike, he was hit by the flying mainboard from outside the door. [Yue Feng] approached with a murderous intent step by step.
0:49:17|0:49:30|The thug charged at [Yue Feng], but was kicked down by him. [Yue Feng] knocked down three thugs to the ground, still not satisfied, he then rushed forward to block the thugs' weapons, grabbed their collars, and threw them to the ground.
0:49:30|0:49:51|After several thugs were subdued, the bald one held up a wooden board to shield [Yue Feng], and punched towards his head. [Yue Feng] used his arms to hold up the board, raised both arms above his head to counterattack, pushing the bald one towards the wall with the board, knocking on the board as they walked, and a large hole was chiseled out of the board.
0:49:51|0:50:8|Baldy was powerless to resist, being thrown to the other corner of the wall, where [Yue Feng] mounted him and beat him to death. The worried principal was on the phone holding his head, when he saw the Han Liu generation's [Yue Feng] returning with the child. [Yue Feng] put the child on the bed.
0:50:10|0:50:22|The principal hurried after them. The little boy furrowed his brow, but he was sleeping deeply after a day of excitement. As the adults walked out of the room, [Yue Feng] closed the door, and the principal said angrily.
0:50:39|0:50:47|[Yue Feng] left, and the principal was worried in the garden. Inside the boxing gym, [Li Shao]'s men were knocked down by the boxers in the gym.
0:51:11|0:51:18|[Li Shao] fell into a memory, back then, he held a gun and pointed it at the bruised face of [A Hai], threatening him.
0:51:27|0:51:39|[阿海] who was tortured couldn't open his eyes, breathing weakly. In his memory, [李少] returned to the reality of the boxing gym, where the man in black delivered a mysterious message. His men were knocked down and couldn't get up.
0:52:5|0:52:9|The next day, [Li Shao] and his men forcefully entered the shelter.
0:52:19|0:52:23|[Li Shao] pulled out a chair and sat down.
0:52:47|0:53:15|Yue Feng's Feishui enters from Luocheng, and another positive sentence [Wang Bo] is brought up, the situation is already ruthless. Li Shao stopped the main down, looked satisfied at Yue Feng, A Long looked maliciously at Yue Feng.
0:53:19|0:53:24|[Li Shao] looked [Yue Feng] up and down, smirked cunningly. [Xiao Yi] hurried over.
0:53:47|0:53:51|After unilaterally declaring war, [Li Shao] left in a car and said inside the car.
0:54:26|0:54:34|Outside the door, Xiao Yi accompanied [Yue Feng], who was full of pride and deep in thought. At night, Xiao Yi drove [Yue Feng] home and spoke to him in the car.
0:54:43|0:54:51|[Yue Feng] looked out the window expressionlessly, while Xiao Yi turned her head in surprise at Yue Feng's calmness, but not astonishment.
0:56:44|0:57:0|[Yue Feng] had not even opened the car door when Xiao Yi's hand was placed on top of [Yue Feng]'s hand on his leg. [Yue Feng] lifted Xiao Yi's hand with his other hand and removed his own hand. There was a long silence in the car, with the corners of their mouths twitching slightly, as if trying to hold back something.
0:57:0|0:57:5|[Yue Feng] avoids Xiao Yi's eyes, opens the car door and gets out of the car, while Xiao Yi smiles inside the car.
0:57:6|0:57:29|Yue Feng, holding the key to open the door, felt the gaze behind him. He turned around and saw Xiao Yi waving at him, their eyes met, and he waved back. After entering the house, he still looked back at Xiao Yi through the window with reluctance. Late at night, Huang Mao and Yue Feng signed a life and death contract.
0:57:29|0:57:32|To defend the shelter, [Yue Feng] went to the battlefield alone.
0:57:33|0:57:53|In a one-on-one fight, the professional boxers brought by [Li Shao] were eager to show off, with [Li Shao]'s men ready to watch the show. A boxer in a coat and hat walked out from the team, staring straight at [Yue Feng], like a fierce beast eyeing its prey, with a silent confrontation between them.
0:57:53|0:58:12|The two cautiously circled each other, determination shining in [Yue Feng]'s eyes as if ready to fight to the death. The boxer made the first move, throwing punches and kicks, all of which were caught by [Yue Feng]. After realizing [Yue Feng]'s strength, the boxer gradually increased his power, revealing his true fighting spirit.
0:58:12|0:58:32|However, [Yue Feng] did not show his strength, but was kicked away by [Yue Feng]. After taking a few steps back, he patted the dust off his coat, fortunately he was prepared for defense. At this moment, he adjusted his position while moving left and right, then targeted the opponent and launched a fierce attack. [Yue Feng] was blocked on the chin, stepped back tightly, using retreat as an advance, his defense was elusive.
0:58:32|0:58:40|The boxer did not hit the target, but skillfully turned defense into offense in an instant. His fists moved rapidly, but failed to land a solid blow.
0:58:41|0:59:2|[Yue Feng] dodged the boxer's attack, twisted his body and kicked the boxer in the stomach. While the boxer was kicked away, his waistband was grabbed by [Yue Feng]. [Yue Feng] then put the luggage on the ground and almost cooperated with the boxer. As the boxer turned around from behind, his hands were suppressed by [Yue Feng], making his movements ineffective and unable to dodge.
0:59:2|0:59:11|[Yue Feng] turned around with the posture of a victor, [Li Shao] with a gloomy face, the mysterious man sat in the shadows, recalling the scene where [Li Shao] approached him.
0:59:18|0:59:39|The scene shifts, [Li Shao] enters as the second boxer, exchanging high-fives and cheers to dispel the previous gloom. The second boxer limbers up, looking very arrogant, his confident and calm demeanor sharply contrasting with [Yue Feng]. The boxer moves closer to [Yue Feng], raises his hand in provocation, and then immediately throws a punch.
0:59:45|0:59:54|His punches and kicks are extremely fast, and [Yue Feng] is having a hard time defending. [Li Shao] and the boxer are showing outstanding performance that seems unbeatable.
0:59:57|1:0:13|At this moment, the boxer was feeling complacent and launched several flying kicks. [Yue Feng] took the opportunity to counterattack with punches, using the organization's boxing techniques. After several rounds of confrontation, they switched to close combat, grabbing each other's belts.
1:0:13|1:0:29|The boxer pressed on step by step, [Yue Feng] tried to grab the boxer's arm to throw him down, but was caught off guard by the boxer. The boxer lifted [Yue Feng] around the waist and slammed him heavily from behind to the ground, "My life is in your hands, just say what you want?"
1:0:58|1:1:18|Memories and reality intertwine, accompanied by sighs. The man returns to reality, only to see [Yue Feng] grabbing the boxer's foot, spinning it around and throwing it aside. The boxer kicks [Yue Feng], who retaliates with a fiery kick, creating distance. The boxer angrily tears off his jacket.
1:1:18|1:1:42|[Yue Feng] also took off his jacket. [Xiao Yi] was about to reach out, but the camera shifted back to the confrontation scene. Yue Feng charged out again, kicking the boxer onto a pile of goods, rapidly throwing punches at him. Finally, he delivered a kick to the boxer's face, knocking him down and dealing with the troublesome enemy. Gasping for breath, [Yue Feng] looked towards [Xiao Yi].
1:1:42|1:1:59|[Li Shao] smirked sinisterly, clapping his hands as he stood up. In the shadows, a mysterious man watched silently, secretly sizing up the situation. All his men stood up and slowly approached behind [Yue Feng]. The mysterious man slowly walked into [Yue Feng]'s line of sight from behind [Li Shao] and [A Long].
1:1:59|1:2:5|When their eyes met, [Yue Feng] stood in shock, staring at the familiar face in front of him, [A Hai].
1:2:6|1:2:31|A Hai's eyes were full of complex emotions, Yue Feng looked worried, the two brothers stared at each other for a long time. A Hai spoke, Li Shao stood up with a sinister look, whispering behind A Hai in the dark.
1:2:38|1:2:44|A Hai obeyed and was replaced by the professional killer [A Long], who launched the first attack from the side.
1:2:54|1:3:6|[Li Shao] puzzled about the relationship between the two, the actor who lowered his head, flashed a hint of a mysterious profile, [A Hai] reached for [Yue Feng]'s chin, [Yue Feng] took a heavy blow, feeling unsteady, [A Hai] swung his fist and rushed in, vaguely recalling the past.
1:3:10|1:3:20|Thinking back to the past, the two brothers played a game of fist bumping. The fist swung by [A Hai] hung in the air, stopping in front of [Yue Feng], leaving him feeling extremely surprised.
1:3:20|1:3:40|[Li Shao] met the stern gaze of [A Long] from the side, then stared firmly at the approaching [A Hai]. Under [Li Shao]'s intense glare, [A Hai] spoke slowly and deliberately. [Li Shao] lowered his eyes, hiding a fleeting look of astonishment, then raised them again, suppressing his anger.
1:3:40|1:3:54|[Li Shao] stared at [A Hai] as he leisurely stood up, his deep eyes revealing no emotion, but instead a smirk. [Li Shao] used his weapon to strike at [A Hai]'s abdomen, glaring at him as [A Hai] blocked [Yue Feng], demanding from [Li Shao].
1:3:57|1:4:12|Li Shao's unpredictable face flashed a sinister smile as he stared at A Hai and Yue Feng, slowly picking up the life-and-death contract he had signed with Yue Feng earlier, tearing it into pieces in front of everyone's eyes.
1:4:12|1:4:24|The burly men under [Li Shao] glared fiercely at [Yue Feng] and [A Hai], blocking their way out. [Li Shao] angrily shouted, "Take [A Hai] home!" After returning home with [A Hai], [Yue Feng] asked.
1:4:42|1:4:45|Lying down, [A Hai] looked up at the ceiling, shaking his head in confusion.
1:4:53|1:4:57|Yue Feng, with a worried look on his face, holds A Hai's hand, speaking with great sincerity.
1:5:3|1:5:10|One day, as the sun rose and dispelled the darkness, [Yue Feng] bid farewell to the shelter and left. Xiao Yi chased after him from the door, her eyes red with tears.
1:5:18|1:5:20|[Yue Feng] stood still, frowning.
1:5:24|1:5:48|Auntie blurred her eyes at the door, watching [Yue Feng] bid farewell to the children. The children lingered around, reluctant to part, as [Yue Feng] said goodbye. Tears flowed from Auntie's moist eyes, filled with deep sorrow. Auntie's blurred eyes watched [Yue Feng] with a single shoulder bag, leaving without looking back, unable to hold back the tears any longer.
1:5:48|1:5:50|In the billiard room, [A Long] says to [Li Shao].
1:6:18|1:6:37|[Li Shao]'s eyes flashed with a glimmer of light, coming up with a new idea. He bent down, aimed at the cue ball, and hit it hard, sinking the ball into the pocket. The next day, as [Yue Feng]'s father-in-law opened the taxi door, he was dragged out of the car by a burly man from behind and brutally beaten with weapons.
1:6:38|1:6:54|Yue Feng, returning home with his backpack, saw the scene from a distance and rushed towards the man attacking his father, scaring the tough guys into fleeing in a panic. Yue Feng's father, with a face full of injuries from the beating, asked.
1:6:57|1:7:16|Who knew the father was not grateful, wiped the blood off his face, and pushed away [Yue Feng]. [Yue Feng] tightly grabbed his father's arm, prepared cotton balls on the table after his father entered the room, and his father gently moved his right arm, asking. Both the father and [Yue Feng] kept their heads down, not looking at each other.
1:7:16|1:7:26|[Yue Feng] propped up his father's shoulder, holding a cotton ball ready to apply medicine for his father. He carefully held his father's left hand with one hand, and gently wiped his father's right temple with the other.
1:7:27|1:7:31|The next moment, the father snatched the cotton ball and shook off [Yue Feng]'s hand.
1:7:59|1:8:13|After listening to his father's teachings, [Yue Feng] raised his head, furrowed his brows slightly, and walked out of the house impatiently. His father, with a soft heart, watched his child's departing figure with reluctance on his face, standing up but not knowing what he could do.
1:8:13|1:8:21|[Yue Feng] was blowing in the cold wind, wandering in this city that isolated himself from the outside world, and arrived at the Pancake Granny's stall, knowing that night had fallen.
1:8:26|1:8:29|The granny reached out her hands and straightened a hat for [Yue Feng].
1:9:3|1:9:18|An old man and a young boy leaning against the roadside, the scene shifts to the director's shelter, where several men dressed in dark sneak in, their faces indiscernible. [Yue Feng] sits outside the operating room, his face full of worry. A nurse walks out and looks down the corridor before speaking.
1:9:21|1:9:46|[Yue Feng] stood up and walked towards the nurse. As the nurse left, [Yue Feng] turned around in self-blame, when suddenly his phone rang. In the dim morning light, [Yue Feng] stood hesitantly on the familiar rooftop, struggling with each step.
1:9:51|1:10:10|Memories flow between past experiences, constantly rewinding back to the starting point. In a daze, still in a showdown with [A Hai], his suspended fist, the iron rod hitting [A Hai] from [Li Shao], in the blink of an eye, turned into everyone hammering on the father with sticks.
1:10:18|1:10:29|Fear, unease, worry, tenderness, and heartbreak all surged up together. The complex emotions intertwined, pulling Yue Feng back to reality.
1:10:31|1:10:48|Wearing the training jacket for the showdown with Yan Shao, [Yue Feng] seemed to be putting on his armor, walking proudly from the darkness into the light, looking down on everything in front of him. He arrived at the warehouse, ready to have a life-and-death battle with [Li Shao] and his men to rescue the principal.
1:10:50|1:10:58|In the warehouse, more than twenty criminals were already eager to go, all holding iron rods and steel pipes, staring fiercely at [Yue Feng] who came to challenge them.
1:11:35|1:11:52|Beside the second floor, the dual-headed state, everyone was injured, the axe shield at the bottom of the stairs rushed towards [Yue Feng]. [Yue Feng] was not smooth at all, despising the world, he kicked towards the second floor state that came forward, and no one could get close to [Yue Feng]'s body.
1:11:52|1:11:57|[Yue Feng] didn't even throw a punch, he used the tornado chop and took care of everyone himself.
1:12:54|1:13:15|Surrounded by burly men like an eagle, [Yue Feng] stood proudly, but they dared not approach. The bald strong man stared nervously at [Yue Feng], then couldn't sit still any longer. He rushed forward in three steps, his punches and kicks were fast, but he was kicked to the ground by [Yue Feng].
1:13:15|1:13:26|The burly man refused to give up and got up to continue the attack. [Yue Feng] lifted him up and slammed him heavily from behind to the ground. The furious burly man made others shout out:
1:13:40|1:13:56|No one dared to hurt him. Only Yue Feng was unable to grasp the momentum card controlled by Wol Yu, and was knocked down. At this moment, Guangze rebelled and picked up a wooden board, hitting behind Yue Feng, counterattacking the Bible Yuecheng Lao Fan, and the bald man called on others.
1:14:32|1:14:46|Without climbing a single brick, fiercely aiming the gun at the head of the intruder, not knocking down a single person. Meanwhile, [Yue Feng] is confronting the encircling attackers, holding a two-meter-long stick resembling a beard, rushing towards him from a distance, stabbing at [Yue Feng]'s abdomen.
1:14:47|1:15:1|Yue Feng lay on the abandoned sofa, the bald strong man with grievances in his heart. Yue Feng grabbed the long stick, exerted all his strength, snatched the stick, and retaliated in kind. The bald strong man was instantly thrown into the air.
1:15:2|1:15:22|Surrounded by approaching strong men who were knocked down by long sticks, unable to get up. [A Long] stood high and looked down, as their eyes met, [Yue Feng] showed a victorious smile and dropped the long stick. At this critical moment of life and death, the bald strong man picked up the nearby long blade and used his last bit of strength to strike at [Yue Feng].
1:15:23|1:15:29|Chang Ren was easily taken over by [Yue Feng] and the bald strong man fell to the ground and couldn't get up.
1:15:53|1:16:8|The assailant exerted a certain amount of force, approaching the situation of the relay, stepping into the sunlight. [A Long] felt the force was not enough, and forcefully struck the dough next to him. With such great force, the wooden board shattered into pieces, then quickly struck towards [Yue Feng].
1:16:8|1:16:18|[Yue Feng] was forced into a corner, suddenly kicked [A Long], sending him flying three meters away. The two adjusted their stance, clenched their fists, and assumed a fighting posture.
1:16:39|1:17:0|[A Long] immediately flew down, wielding his dragon hand knife. [Yue Feng] dodged from a distance, as A Long continued to swing his knife, increasing the speed of his strikes. A few times, A Long's strikes missed and hit the surrounding objects. The speed of their moves became faster and faster, leaving the onlookers dazzled. A Long kept attacking, aiming at [Yue Feng]'s face, but [Yue Feng] bent backwards and dodged a strike.
1:17:3|1:17:12|After getting up, Yue Feng swiftly wielded his knife, slashing A Long's left arm. A Long winced in pain, struggling to switch the grip of the knife.
1:17:13|1:17:35|[Yue Feng] swung his knife towards [A Long]'s waist, leaving him no chance to fight back. A wound was cut on A Long's waist, causing him to stand in pain and hold onto his injured waist. Despite the injury, he continued to fight desperately, blood dripping from his right waist, a fierce look on his face. A Long used his injured left hand to support his right waist, while his right hand struggled to block Yue Feng's attacks, being forced to retreat step by step.
1:17:35|1:17:39|When approaching the wall, [Yue Feng] kicked and knocked [A Long] down to the ground.
1:17:40|1:17:50|[A Long] struggled to stand up, but failed. He carefully picked up the long knife beside his feet, trying to use it for support, but still failed.
1:18:0|1:18:19|[Yue Feng] dropped the long blade in his hand, turned to look at the people he had knocked down, and ran into the warehouse. The principal was tied up in the middle of the warehouse, unable to move, with his mouth gagged with cotton cloth, unable to speak. [Yue Feng] ran forward, untying the ropes binding the principal.
1:18:27|1:18:39|[Lee Shao] sneaked out from behind the box and approached the two. [Yue Feng] ignored the principal's concerns, glared at [Lee Shao], and stood up. Impatiently, [Lee Shao] fired at [Yue Feng].
1:19:0|1:19:19|[Yue Feng] suddenly grabbed the right hand of [Li Shao] holding the gun, then swiftly turned his body and aimed the gun at [Li Shao]. The gun went off accidentally, a gunshot rang out, hitting [Li Shao] in a vital spot. [Li Shao] held his abdomen, sat down on the ground. Beside him, [Yue Feng] stood still, looking at his left hand that had accidentally fired the gun in shock.
1:19:19|1:19:26|Feeling the warmth in his heart, [Yue Feng] collapsed to the ground, his left arm shot by [Li Shao] moments ago, the pain making his consciousness hazy.
1:20:3|1:20:8|Speak up, [Xiao Yi] grabbed the mesh fence behind him with both hands and spoke as he stood up.
1:20:13|1:20:26|The voice had just fallen, and the scene shifted to the hospital. [Yue Feng] was lying on the hospital bed, his consciousness hazy. He slowly opened his eyes, realizing that it was just a dream. He noticed the little doctor beside the bed looking worriedly at him, softly asking him.
1:20:37|1:20:40|A police officer in uniform walks into the hospital room.
1:20:44|1:21:7|Walking out of the ward, we fast forward one month. Through the eyes of [Yue Feng], we arrive at the doorstep of his father's house. [Father-in-law] is cleaning the carriage. After a warm farewell between father and son, the father happily continues cleaning the car and then drives off in a taxi to start a new day of work.
1:21:9|1:21:33|Yue Feng still reluctantly watched his father drive away, then slowly walked out of the alley, holding the flowers and gift box he bought for his aunt. As he walked through the crowd and traffic, when he reached a deeper area, Yue Feng noticed a car in the distance with eyes watching him from the rear side. When he turned around, he didn't see anything unusual, so Yue Feng continued walking into the parking lot.
1:22:2|1:22:18|In the memory, [Yue Feng] nodded with joy, but in reality, he remained unconscious. Xiao Yi said that a delicate silver necklace slipped from his hand, with a design of a bear eagle spreading its wings, which deeply moved [Yue Feng].
1:22:18|1:22:25|The two stood on the bridge, looking out at the river, standing closely together, the scene appeared very harmonious and happy.
1:22:27|1:22:46|The scene shifts back to reality, Yue Feng's phone drops to the side. Yue Feng's consciousness is fuzzy, remembering vaguely that Xiao Yi gently put a necklace on him. The sudden ringing of the phone did not bring the unconscious Yue Feng back to reality, the caller ID shows that it is Xiao Yi.
1:22:48|1:23:9|Yue Feng lay on the ground, still wearing the eagle necklace that Xiao Yi gave her around her neck. The soaring eagle in the sky symbolizes Yue Feng, and is also the Yue Feng in Xiao Yi's heart. Legend has it that the eagle is the bird with the longest lifespan in the world. When its life is more than half over, it must fly to a cliff.
1:23:10|1:23:29|Using rocks to shatter the old ties that bend like sickles, using wisdom to pull out the already aged nails, and plucking off the heavy and useless old words. Only with renewed strength and heart can he soar again. He risks the pain and starvation to bid farewell to the past. This process is called rebirth.
