0:0:22|0:0:38|In the distance, a group of Japanese soldiers with sharp knives are slowly approaching a village through the muddy country road. A military officer in boots stops in front of a pile of dirt, squats down, picks up some mud, and smells it in front of his nose. He looks thoughtfully towards the village not far away.
0:0:42|0:0:48|The men who received the order held long spears and knives, continuing to approach the village with malicious intent.
0:1:1|0:1:11|Qin Gui helped his brother up from the haystack, and his injured brother sat down inside it, tremblingly taking out a map of the attack from his arms. Far away, Uncle Shunzi was...
0:1:50|0:2:0|The Japanese soldiers have entered the village. Qin Gui put his injured brother in a basket and hung it from the rafters to hide him.
0:2:10|0:2:30|A skinny younger brother accidentally hung himself on the beam, while the invaders were closing in on the village. The soldiers acted swiftly upon orders, and one of them approached the door, pushing it open. To their surprise, a herd of sheep rushed out, knocking down several soldiers.
0:2:48|0:2:50|The little [Japanese soldiers] who heard the shout were indeed fooled.
0:3:1|0:3:13|The Japanese soldiers fell for the trap set by Qin Gui and searched everywhere for him, while the Eighth Route Army soldiers he had hidden successfully evaded capture. The scene then shifts to a neatly dressed man arriving at the Japanese command post.
0:3:20|0:3:26|[Zuo Zuomu] Ichiro, wearing long boots and carrying a scythe around his waist, walked slowly towards the commanding officer.
0:4:16|0:4:30|Silently, Qin Gui took off the musical instruments hanging from his waist one by one and placed them on the table slowly. Commander looked at the table full of instruments, then glanced at Zuo Zuomu who kept taking out more instruments from his body, shook his head, and felt so angry that he wanted to break the sickle in his hand.
0:4:30|0:4:38|With a loud roar, Commander Qin Gui forcefully twisted the long sickle in his hand, but it remained undamaged. Upon hearing the sound, Zuo Zuomu suddenly lifted his head.
0:4:39|0:4:49|Commander looked at him awkwardly, waiting for his next move. Unexpectedly, the next second, he took out a musical instrument from his bag. The Commander finally sighed helplessly and said:
0:5:0|0:5:16|[Zuo Zuomu], who received the order, turned and left. The commander watched his departing figure, shaking his head helplessly. Inside the house with the character for "happiness" on it, a neatly dressed man, [Qin Gui], was meticulously sewing a pair of adorable tiger-head shoes, with slow and meticulous movements.
0:5:54|0:6:18|In the house, the couple heard the commotion outside the door and looked up together. [Qin Gui] released his wife [Aying] and walked towards the door to greet. [Qin Gui] awkwardly smiled and said to the shopkeeper.
0:6:52|0:6:54|Qin Gui looked at the shopkeeper in horror.
0:7:53|0:7:59|Qin Gui, the fourth brother, sent someone to look for Da Wang the day before.
0:8:9|0:8:19|[Qin Gui] turned his head nervously and said. After speaking, he quickly walked towards the cabinet, where the gun hidden in the Jianghuai River was placed inside, then turned to [Ah Ying] and said.
0:8:27|0:8:32|Qin Gui, who forgot where the book was placed, nervously started rummaging through the cabinet.
0:8:55|0:9:1|With a tight grip on his right fist, he swung it fiercely, hitting the jaw near the ear.
0:9:18|0:9:30|Qin Gui, who was beaten to a daze, said. At this moment, in front of the train station, Qin Gui, with a determined look on his face, was looking around.
0:9:34|0:9:53|With a poker face, Bang Big Brother pretended to casually observe the surroundings. [Qin Gui] arrived at the station at this moment and spoke mysteriously upon seeing the man on the street. Seeing the man's lack of response, he turned his head in confusion and tapped his shoulder.
0:10:9|0:10:18|On the other side, the two discussing cotton in the village were also looking for Qin Gui.
0:11:8|0:11:21|[Qin Gui] carrying the cotton prince on his back, turned around and hit [Uncle Shunzi] on the head. After cursing, [Uncle Shunzi] could only hold his head and follow behind [Qin Gui]. In the blink of an eye, the two who had just been intentionally looking for the Eighth Route Army had already thrown themselves into the cotton-picking business.
0:11:21|0:11:32|At the train station, [Qin Gui] is still repeating the code word over and over again, with one covered in cotton all over his head and face, smiling, and the other standing on a rock, stepping on cotton, following the rhythm of cotton popping, and twisting his butt vigorously.
0:11:36|0:11:43|[Qin Gui] finished the password and could only smile awkwardly at the silly old man. Meanwhile, [Uncle Shunzi] and [Zuo Zuomu] arrived at a teahouse.
0:11:44|0:11:48|After Mr. Zhu defeated the Jin army.
0:12:32|0:12:43|After finishing speaking, Mr. [Uncle Shunzi] took out a book from the package, carefully opened it, picked up the instrument in front of him, and started playing. The two people in the audience cracked melon seeds, watching with great interest on their faces.
0:12:55|0:13:4|At the train station, [Qin Gui] was still looking for people on the street. He walked up to a man and carefully examined him. When the man smiled at him, he quickly squatted down and said.
0:13:19|0:13:25|The storyteller pointed to the sky, and a loud rumbling sound was heard.
0:13:55|0:14:0|He opened his mouth and showed the small props inside to everyone, and then everyone finally relaxed.
0:15:17|0:15:25|The youngest brother thought the Storyteller's voice was impressive, so he stepped forward and gave a thumbs up. Seeing this, the Storyteller, feeling scared, spoke.
0:15:28|0:15:31|The crowd looked at each other in fear.
0:15:50|0:16:0|The old demon and [Uncle Shunzi] ran through the crowd, grabbed something and ran towards the door. Unexpectedly, as soon as they stepped out, they collided with Erzhu who was rushing over. Erzhu, who was knocked down in front of them, weakly raised his head and said.
0:16:26|0:16:37|Uncle Shunzi got up and leaned against the door, looking out, and immediately saw the Japanese soldiers not far away. He was so scared that he quickly closed the door, turned his back to it, gasping heavily, and gesturing wildly with his teeth and claws.
0:16:49|0:17:1|During the conversation, the Japanese soldiers could no longer find where the crowded people were hiding. With their long guns raised, the Japanese soldiers entered the teahouse and walked towards the inner hall. The crowded people hiding behind the tables luckily escaped unharmed, crouching there without daring to make a sound.
0:17:4|0:17:16|Seeing that hiding here was not a solution, [Uncle Shunzi] picked up the club and handed it to the old monster, communicating tactics through sign language. [Uncle Shunzi] gestured to indicate his willingness to join them, then made the sound of a bomber approaching.
0:17:21|0:17:32|[Uncle Shunzi], [Qin Gui], and [Zuo Zuomu] saw the Japanese soldiers being fooled and lying on the ground. They stood up and let out a roar, grabbing household items nearby and charging towards the Japanese soldiers. In no time, they smashed the gun in the hands of the Japanese soldiers.
0:17:32|0:17:40|Qin Gui, Zuo Zuomu, and Uncle Shunzi started playing "Capture the King around the Pillar" with the Japanese soldiers who had lost their guns. Dodging and weaving around the pillar, they moved left and right, creating a momentary stalemate.
0:17:41|0:17:55|Suddenly, the Japanese soldier made a feint and ran towards the wall, bypassing the three of them. Fortunately, Uncle Shunzi was quick to react and ran over to confront the soldier. Meanwhile, Storyteller Mr. sorrowfully touched the musical instrument that had been knocked onto the table.
0:18:1|0:18:4|The Storyteller responded with a sound and ran towards Uncle Shunzi.
0:18:25|0:18:36|The exhausted [Storyteller] ran around and panted heavily, looking left and right.
0:18:36|0:18:49|Uncle Shunzi continued to fight with the Japanese soldiers across from him after finishing speaking. He blocked and pushed with a wooden board, causing a Japanese soldier to punch the board and cry out in pain. Just as he was about to swing his knife at Uncle Shunzi, he was knocked down by Uncle Shunzi in the next second.
0:18:58|0:19:4|The moment [Qin Gui], who had just finished speaking harshly, swung the club and smashed it straight onto the head of the Japanese soldier who was fighting with [Uncle Shunzi].
0:19:13|0:19:29|[Uncle Shunzi] suddenly ran out when the Japanese soldiers in front of him saw the situation, and he was hit by a plank from Uncle Shunzi, falling straight onto one end of the bench, pushing up the other end of the Japanese soldier, hanging on the hook on the roof. The three of them watched the bizarre scene in front of them, their mouths wide open in shock.
0:19:34|0:19:40|Uncle Shunzi, wearing a Japanese soldier's hat, stood with his back to the board and gestured. Seeing this, the Japanese soldier turned and walked outside. Little Yao turned to Uncle Shunzi and said.
0:19:49|0:20:9|Uncle Shunzi grumbled and reluctantly stood up. He had no choice but to walk to the window, looked up, realized he couldn't see anything due to his height, glanced around, saw the Japanese soldier crouching under the stool, kicked him away, and stood on the stool to look outside.
0:20:9|0:20:17|[Qin Gui], Uncle Shunzi said, unexpectedly, the Japanese hanging from the roof suddenly fell down.
0:20:23|0:20:49|The newly arrived Qin Gui was deceived by Uncle Shunzi, sitting on the ground waving his hands constantly without daring to stop for a moment. Meanwhile, Uncle Shunzi was still hanging on the roof. When seeing Uncle Shunzi falling down, Zuo Zuomu not only didn't reach out a hand but also covered his eyes.
0:21:21|0:21:27|Qin Gui, weakly leaning against the wall, gasping for breath, struggled to speak.
0:21:37|0:21:45|Ah, there are enemies everywhere outside. Uncle Shunzi looked at Erzhu leaning against him and spoke with a determined expression.
0:22:0|0:22:15|The storyteller glanced at Erzhu, then at Uncle Shunzi, and began to speak. After finishing his words, the storyteller handed Erzhu to Uncle Shunzi and turned to walk away.
0:23:3|0:23:12|[Qin Gui] and [Uncle Shunzi] had just left the house when they were chased by ghost thieves. They ran to the corner and managed to temporarily shake off the pursuit of the ghost thieves.
0:23:43|0:24:0|The two men ran away with two guns in their arms, heavy and panicked. The Japanese soldiers kept shooting behind them, but the two men seemed invincible. In the rain of bullets, not a single scratch was made on them, as they were all blocked by the wooden board carried by [Uncle Shunzi]. The Japanese soldiers looked at the board being hit and sparking, helpless.
0:24:43|0:24:57|The [Youngest Brother], who had escaped the pursuit, had his position exposed by a sudden shout from [Uncle Shunzi]. The Japanese soldiers rushed over upon hearing the shout, and [Youngest Brother] and his allies ran down the path, with a horde of Japanese soldiers chasing after them.
0:24:57|0:25:9|On the other side, Uncle Shunzi finally managed to shake off the pursuer, just as he let out a sigh of relief, he unexpectedly ran into a foreigner around the corner, walking right into his trap. The foreigner looked at Uncle Shunzi.
0:25:18|0:25:28|Uncle Shunzi pointed casually, only to find that he had pointed directly at Qin Gui who had just arrived. The Japanese soldier immediately raised his gun, only to be knocked down by Uncle Shunzi with a punch the next second.
0:25:38|0:25:45|The two of them successfully escaped in the carriage, while on the other side, Zuo Zuomu was still observing with a telescope.
0:25:56|0:26:12|A Japanese devil soldier approached from a distance, carrying a young man who was picking cotton on his back. [Zuo Zuomu] Ichiro saw this huge creature in front of him and hurried forward. He walked up close, looked left and right, and even turned it over a few times with his hands.
0:26:50|0:27:8|[Qin Gui] quickly turned his head to look at the ground, giving a cold glance at [Uncle Shunzi]. With a sudden whip, [Qin Gui] made [Uncle Shunzi] fall off his seat. After speaking, [Uncle Shunzi] covered his bottom and chased after him.
0:27:8|0:27:15|In the blink of an eye, the two arrived at the train station. In the bustling crowd, only [Uncle Shunzi] and [Storyteller] were wandering around like flies.
0:27:23|0:27:25|Qin Gui suddenly appeared behind the two.
0:28:2|0:28:11|[Qin Gui] had just finished speaking when he turned his head and saw [Uncle Shunzi] hurrying over. After sizing him up, he spoke.
0:28:20|0:28:23|Qin Gui excitedly rushed to the Storyteller.
0:29:10|0:29:20|The invaders stormed into the train station carrying cannons, initiating a continuous bombardment towards the crowd. The civilians were thrown into chaos by the shelling, scrambling to grab their luggage and flee for their lives.
0:29:20|0:29:32|In the midst of the gunfire at the train station, [Qin Gui] ran while taking off his long robe, dodging the flying shells, panting heavily as he chased after [Uncle Shunzi] ahead. On the other side, [Zuo Zuomu] ordered the attack on the crowd.
0:29:52|0:30:11|The explosion sounded, the soil on the ground splashed, and the air was filled with smoke. As the smoke cleared, Uncle Shunzi and Zuo Zuomu were revealed, their faces covered in dirt from the blast. Uncle Shunzi turned his head, looked at Storyteller who had already dodged the bomb and was running into the distance, pointed with his finger, and said.
0:30:21|0:30:38|Upon hearing Zuo Zuomu's command, the two invaders quickly loaded ammunition in preparation to shoot, but to their surprise, the next moment they made a mistake and the bomb fell straight down towards themselves. On the other side, Qin Gui and Uncle Shunzi climbed up the terraced fields with great difficulty, panting heavily from exhaustion, finally catching sight of the storyteller who was drinking water.
0:30:41|0:30:45|Upon hearing the sound, Mr. [Uncle Shunzi] turned around and spat a mouthful of water directly onto [Youngest Brother]'s face.
0:31:7|0:31:18|The three people who were talking suddenly heard the buzzing sound of an airplane. [Qin Gui] pinched open the mouth of [Uncle Shunzi] to see if it was him making the sound.
0:31:25|0:31:27|[Qin Gui] walked up to [Uncle Shunzi] with his head held high.
0:31:48|0:32:0|In the next moment, a shell landed not far from the two, but they managed to escape by lying down in time. Before they could even breathe a sigh of relief, another shell flew across the sky, and the group of people covering their ears waited for the shell to land.
0:32:0|0:32:7|After a loud noise, it turned out that what fell was not a shell. Mr. [Uncle Shunzi] inside the house turned his head and looked outside the door.
0:32:16|0:32:32|Crouching outside the door, [Qin Gui] and [Uncle Shunzi] moved in unison, kneeling on the ground and retreating step by step. Behind them, arriving late, was [Zuo Zuomu]. [Zuo Zuomu] strode forward, panting heavily, and stopped in front of the two who were crawling backwards with their buttocks raised.
0:32:53|0:33:8|The storyteller inside the house vigorously shook the window trying to get out, [Qin Gui] also imitated the actions of [Uncle Shunzi] and [Old Youngest], lying on the ground, sticking his butt out and slowly backing away step by step. After retreating a certain distance, the three of them looked at the distant bomb and slowly stood up.
0:33:8|0:33:16|Qin Gui patted his pants, took out a gun from the pocket, aimed it forward, and Uncle Shunzi turned his head and quickly knocked the gun away.
0:33:28|0:33:36|The old demon and Qin Gui, who were cursing each other as traitors, were pulling each other's ears. Seeing the two fighting, [Uncle Shunzi] picked up the gun from the ground.
0:34:12|0:34:19|Just as [Uncle Shunzi] rescued [Mr. Uncle], he suddenly smelled smoke, looked up at the shells, and laughed.
0:35:2|0:35:10|Seeing the densely packed Japanese soldiers below the mountain, Lao Yao finally reacted, shouting and running up the mountain. Nan [Qin Gui] glanced down and shouted.
0:35:26|0:35:40|With a deafening roar, the shells exploded down the mountain, engulfed in flames like a volcanic eruption, carrying a huge blast wave. The Japanese soldiers below were covered in dust and dirt from the explosion. [Zuo Zuomu] looked up and shouted.
0:35:44|0:36:0|At the command, the little devils below the mountain picked up their weapons and continued to launch an attack towards the mountain. The old monsters had no weapons and were chased away. At this moment, [Uncle Shunzi] turned around, making machine gun sounds with his mouth, and wrapped the gun in his clothes, aiming at the devils.
0:36:0|0:36:9|After a burst of gunfire, he bundled up his clothes again, imitated the sound of a grenade, and threw the clothes at the Japanese soldiers. His movements were as fierce as a tiger, leaving [Qin Gui] speechless with astonishment.
0:36:21|0:36:29|However, Uncle Shunzi was also waving the gun around, but didn't manage to fire a single shot. In the next second, he casually threw it and hit Zuo Zuomu.
0:36:32|0:36:49|Zuo Zuomu, who was hit in the foot, held his foot and spun around. Seeing the situation, Uncle Shunzi suddenly realized, quickly squatted down to pick up the gun, and threw it towards the front. It hit another Japanese soldier's foot directly, now two people were spinning around holding their feet.
0:36:49|0:36:53|Even when everyone had run away and no one was holding a gun, he turned around and picked up the gun.
0:36:57|0:37:1|[Aying], who was a step behind, failed to keep up with the others and ran in the wrong direction.
0:37:20|0:37:24|Uncle Shunzi opened his mouth wide in shock, then quickly lay down, but as he did, he happened to lie right next to the hand grenade.
0:37:44|0:37:53|The Japanese soldiers went to chase the old demon and the others, while [Uncle Shunzi] remained crouched in place, staring at the hand grenade beside him with his mouth open. When the Japanese soldiers moved away, he slowly inched forward.
0:37:53|0:38:9|On the other side, the three of them had already run into the village. Qin Gui and Uncle Shunzi knocked on the door desperately, then ran towards the haystack on the side to find a place to hide. The other two followed, but the figure of the old demon was nowhere to be seen.
0:38:12|0:38:18|Finally, Mr. [Uncle Shunzi] walked over and saw that both of them had fallen into the cellar together.
0:38:55|0:39:0|The Japanese soldier was knocked unconscious by the Storyteller coming down the stairs with a rifle butt.
0:39:25|0:39:29|In the cellar, the old demon suddenly pointed a gun at [Qin Gui] and said.
0:39:42|0:39:49|Shh, the [Storyteller] stopped the two of them and slowly walked towards the cellar, looking up and observing. The old demon spoke.
0:40:5|0:40:17|Above the cellar, two Japanese soldiers were playing around a haystack, chasing a chicken at the cellar entrance. The three people inside the cellar were trembling in fear as they watched the soldiers above. Luckily, at a critical moment, the soldiers were called back for dinner.
0:40:17|0:40:30|In the cellar, the three of them breathed a sigh of relief as they saw the Japanese soldiers leaving. Feeling the crisis was over, they pushed away [Qin Gui], whom they had just been holding onto. [Qin Gui] also disdainfully patted the shoulder that had just been leaned on. Then, [Storyteller] spoke up.
0:40:59|0:41:7|Upon hearing this, Qin Gui and Zuo Zuomu released their hands with a cold snort. The old demon touched his ear and sat down by the wall in a dejected manner. Storyteller spoke up and asked.
0:41:33|0:41:41|In a moment of emotional turmoil, [Qin Gui] held the small shoe in his hand, thinking of his wife at home with a face full of sorrow, slowly raising his head to look into the distance.
0:42:45|0:42:58|I haven't counted, but there are definitely Japanese people. The scene shifts, and the village is surrounded by villagers. In the cellar on the other side, [Qin Gui], with grass shavings on his head, lies on the ladder, his big eyes focused intently on the situation outside.
0:43:30|0:43:48|The falling Japanese soldier was blocked by a sneaky elbow from [Qin Gui]. As soon as [Qin Gui] heard the old demon speak, he immediately stopped, turned around, and looked around.
0:43:52|0:44:7|The scene shifts, and [Qin Gui] has changed into the clothes of the Japanese soldiers, struggling to poke his head out of the cellar. Then, he carefully observed the surroundings, seeing no Japanese soldiers around the cellar, and slowly climbed out. He stood up, looking around on both sides.
0:44:7|0:44:11|The next moment, Qin Gui looked down and found that his pants were not fastened, so he turned around to adjust his clothes.
0:44:28|0:44:39|The falling Japanese soldier was immediately pinned to the ground. On the other side, [Qin Gui] was holding a bundle of firewood, walking forward nervously.
0:44:48|0:45:3|[Qin Gui] took the chicken handed to him by [Zuo Zuomu] and started eating it bite by bite. After finishing, he wiped his oily mouth with his arm and answered. The youngest brother, who had changed his clothes, was called over by the two of them.
0:45:11|0:45:26|[Qin Gui] stuffed the chicken into [Uncle Shunzi]'s mouth while talking, and [Uncle Shunzi] walked away with the chicken in a daze. Hearing [Zuo Zuomu] calling for him, [Qin Gui] reluctantly glanced at [Uncle Shunzi] and walked in slowly.
0:45:49|0:45:57|On the other side, the innkeeper Chen [Qin Gui] was not at home, quietly lurking outside his house. When [Ah Ying] opened the door, the innkeeper who was lurking on the door fell straight to the ground.
0:46:12|0:46:18|[Aying] knocked her down with one punch, causing the door frame to weep.
0:46:39|0:46:55|[Aying] looked into the distance with tears streaming down her face. In the distance, [Qin Gui] seemed to have a reaction and sneezed twice. He muttered [Aying]'s name and looked towards the direction of home.
0:47:0|0:47:9|Upon hearing Qin Gui calling out to her, Zuo Zuomu snapped back to reality. Meanwhile, Uncle Shunzi finished packing up, walked out the door, locked it, wiped away the tears on his face, and set off.
0:47:9|0:47:21|The fugitive trio arrived at a trench made entirely of soil. [Qin Gui] picked up a stone from the ground and followed behind the storyteller. He raised the stone in his hand, about to throw it, but was spotted by [Uncle Shunzi].
0:47:23|0:47:27|Qin Gui, with a gun pointed at his back, immediately dropped the stone in his hand.
0:47:57|0:48:4|A group of villagers holding shovels appeared on the hilltop. The three looked up and heard someone in the crowd shout.
0:49:1|0:49:8|Uncle Shunzi walked towards the three with his back turned and spoke.
0:50:0|0:50:6|Zuo Zuomu held the young master of sandalwood cotton in his arms, bowing his head in contemplation.
0:50:21|0:50:26|Speaking of this, [Zuo Zuomu] Ichiro looked at the sandalwood prince in his hand and said to the person beside him.
0:50:38|0:50:50|Zuo Zuomu's eyes became more determined as he spoke, but suddenly, a harsh sound interrupted him. Looking up, they saw that the record in the phonograph had broken. The other three looked at the chaotic scene in front of them.
0:52:24|0:52:32|Watching the Storyteller walk away, Qin Gui knelt down with a thud and said to the Storyteller.
0:53:25|0:53:34|[Qin Gui] sobbed uncontrollably, pleading with [Storyteller], tears rolling down his face in big drops. [Storyteller] helped [Qin Gui] up from the ground where he was kneeling.
0:54:41|0:54:59|Listen, the group of people took a sharp breath together. In the village, the Japanese soldiers were still patrolling in an orderly manner. They peeked out and saw the dark mass of Japanese soldiers, exclaiming in shock.
0:55:41|0:55:54|The three agreed [Qin Gui] once again disguised as Japanese soldiers, with the bound [Uncle Shunzi], swaggered into the Japanese camp. The successful infiltrators searched for the cellar among the crowd.
0:56:12|0:56:37|Suddenly, a Japanese soldier stopped them, walked up to [Uncle Shunzi], and said. Shunzi watched the Japanese soldier walk away and breathed a sigh of relief, then turned to look at [Ah Ying].
0:56:49|0:57:7|[Qin Gui] finished speaking, his eyes filled with determination, carrying a fearless courage, striding forward. At this moment, [Zuo Zuomu] Ichiro was still tending to his wounds. The four of them, including [Qin Gui], were still standing in the corner, watching [Zuo Zuomu] Ichiro in front, crying out in pain. Finally, they gathered their courage and took a few steps forward.
0:57:10|0:57:16|[Uncle Shunzi] had only taken a few steps when he was suddenly startled by a loud shout from [Zuo Zuomu] Ichiro.
0:57:40|0:57:54|[Zuo Zuomu] Ichiro listened, picked up the wooden stick beside him, struggled to stand up, and walked towards the door with the stick for support. When he reached the door, he looked at the Japanese soldiers outside roasting meat over the fire and waved his hand.
0:58:32|0:58:35|The named [Uncle Shunzi] was so scared that he was trembling.
0:59:2|0:59:18|The accidentally revealed secret made [Qin Gui] gasp in shock, sweating profusely. At that moment, the clueless Uncle Shunzi crawled out from the cellar. Seeing this, the Storyteller immediately took out a prop and imitated the roaring sound of an airplane.
0:59:22|0:59:25|The Japanese soldiers, upon hearing this, quickly lay down on the ground, and Uncle Shunzi pulled up Qin Gui.
0:59:28|0:59:31|On the other side, [Uncle Shunzi] also successfully climbed over the wall and jumped onto a car to escape.
0:59:44|0:59:57|Uncle Shunzi acted swiftly, knocking him out with one punch. The driverless car also veered into the nearby haystack. After a loud crash, Uncle Shunzi emerged from the haystack covered in straw, glanced around, and immediately ran off.
0:59:57|1:0:15|Unexpectedly, the next moment, a car arrived in front of him, scaring him to turn and run. The person in the car grabbed Uncle Shunzi by the collar and pulled him into the car.
1:0:22|1:0:26|Upon hearing these words, [Uncle Shunzi] finally quieted down and turned around to see that it was actually [Qin Gui].
1:1:17|1:1:29|After the sound of gunfire, the car drove into a ditch, causing the group to inadvertently miss a military vehicle full of bandits. The military vehicle traveled down a small road to a mountain pass, where the bandits lying in ambush gave orders.
1:2:38|1:3:5|The group of people who successfully escaped danger arrived in front of a temple. Suddenly, [Qin Gui] raised his gun and spoke to the other three. Looking at [Uncle Shunzi] who only raised one hand, [Qin Gui] asked.
1:3:9|1:3:24|Wearing a Japanese military uniform, [Qin Gui] raised his gun towards the three people with their hands up, looked around and saw no one nearby. He then searched [Uncle Shunzi]'s body. In no time, he found the attack plan hidden on [Uncle Shunzi]. The three of them looked at [Qin Gui] with a face full of resentment and cursed at him.
1:3:35|1:3:55|Uncle Shunzi looked at Qin Gui with a look of disbelief as he raised his hand. Listen, Qin Gui slowly walked towards Lao Yao with his hand raised, and Lao Yao quickly covered his face with both hands. Qin Gui's palm landed on the storyteller's face.
1:4:2|1:4:16|Uncle Shunzi pushed Qin Gui away when he saw the Japanese soldiers coming out, and ran outside. The three of them watched Uncle Shunzi running away, speechless, and the next second they were taken to the temple. Inside the temple, Qin Gui was reporting the situation to the Japanese leader with his head down.
1:4:46|1:4:52|[Qin Gui] snorted coldly, rolled his eyes, and suddenly saw something next to him, walking over in a daze.
1:4:53|1:5:4|[Uncle Shunzi] pushed aside the curtain, and his beloved son Qin Gui appeared before him, as if meeting a long-lost friend. With a look of tenderness, he gently touched her, and Zuo Zuomu stood up at the sight.
1:5:32|1:5:35|Ichiro Zuo Zuomu admires Uncle Shunzi.
1:6:51|1:7:13|[Uncle Shunzi] thought for a moment, watching as [Zuo Zuomu] Ichiro adjusted the bowstring. With a command from Ichiro, the Japanese soldiers picked up the cushions beside them and knelt down in rows. Seeing that his sitting posture was different from the Japanese soldiers, [Qin Gui] quickly changed his sitting position.
1:7:13|1:7:16|Zuo Zuomu, seated, turned to Qin Gui and said.
1:7:38|1:7:42|[Qin Gui] cleared his throat and solemnly picked up the "Cotton Gentleman" to start speaking.
1:7:54|1:7:59|She stood on the high mountain, calling out to her beloved.
1:8:21|1:8:37|Qin Gui, who was about to lose, looked at Uncle Shunzi with a worried face. Qin Gui breathed a sigh of relief, but the next second, Zuo Zuomu pointed to the wooden board and asked, "What is the name of that instrument?"
1:8:52|1:9:17|Qin Gui asked incredulously. Outside the temple, Uncle Shunzi hid behind a pillar, looking towards the temple and cursing. Inside the temple, Qin Gui kept the rhythm while exchanging glances with the Storyteller playing the cotton bow, then Zuo Zuomu spoke.
1:11:4|1:11:11|Zuo Zuomu bows to Qin Gui and hands the wooden board in his hand to the storyteller, then walks over with a flattering expression.
1:11:14|1:11:16|[Qin Gui] widened his eyes, swallowed hard, and said.
1:11:30|1:11:34|Zuo Zuomu nodded and said to the Japanese soldiers behind him.
1:11:37|1:11:44|With an incredulous look on his face, outside the temple, [Uncle Shunzi] said to the person next to him. Inside the temple, Zuo Zuomu conducted the choir.
1:12:16|1:12:25|Outside the temple, [Ah Ying] with a bundle on her back, heard the distant singing and walked towards the temple. Inside the temple, Zuo Zuomu looked at the dazed Qin Gui and said.
1:12:32|1:12:36|[Qin Gui] stood up trembling, eyes wide with fear, looking around nervously before singing in a quivering voice.
1:13:40|1:13:44|Unexpectedly, [Qin Gui] actually appeared at the entrance of the temple. Upon seeing this, Zuo Zuomu sighed.
1:14:59|1:15:18|Qin Gui looked at Ah Ying's departing figure with lingering fear. But the next moment, when he lowered his head, he found that the attack map he had stuffed into Ah Ying's package had actually fallen on the ground. Carefully squatting down, Qin Gui picked up the map and was about to put it back into his arms when Zuo Zuomu suddenly turned around and shouted.
1:15:41|1:15:45|The Japanese soldiers singing in the temple widened their eyes when they heard footsteps outside.
1:15:58|1:16:19|Zuo Zuomu listened to the commotion outside the temple and exclaimed in disbelief. Outside the temple, the villagers on the hill were waving their hoes and marching towards the temple. Zuo Zuomu ordered to flee, but Qin Gui, who was about to run away, was stopped.
1:16:21|1:16:33|In the next moment, Zuo Zuomu was riding on the shoulders of [Qin Gui]. As Zuo Zuomu, riding on [Qin Gui]'s shoulders, was being carried by the rampaging [Qin Gui], he crashed into the beam and fell straight backwards.
1:16:33|1:16:38|Qin Gui continued to run unknowingly, but as he ran, only two boots were left on Qin Gui's body.
1:16:46|1:17:8|In the temple, [Qin Gui] spoke to the Buddha statue, while [Uncle Shunzi] watched the Japanese soldiers fleeing from the back door and hurried to inform the villagers. The villagers who had just arrived at the temple gate met the two who ran out of the temple, with one of them speaking,
1:17:53|1:18:1|On the other side, the fleeing Japanese soldiers had already arrived in the city by car, and Zuo Zuomu shouted at the people in the car to speak up.
1:18:12|1:18:35|Approaching the gate, Qin Gui, who was about to slip away, was spotted by the sharp-eyed Japanese soldiers beside him. With the soldiers following closely behind, Qin Gui could only reluctantly shuffle his steps and slowly walk inside. At the city gate, the Japanese soldiers were conducting a thorough search of the people entering the city.
1:18:35|1:18:38|[Uncle Shunzi] and the other two arrived at the city gate, watched by [Storyteller].
1:18:45|1:19:3|[Aying] had just walked into her own front gate when she brushed past the three people entering the city. The three of them aimlessly arrived at the entrance of a courtyard, and the storyteller spoke up. Just as they entered the courtyard, they were chased out by the dogs inside the courtyard the next second.
1:19:7|1:19:13|[Uncle Shunzi] is at the door, the lecherous shopkeeper knocks again, [Uncle Shunzi] opens the door. [Uncle Shunzi] raises his fist.
1:19:26|1:19:39|The shouting shopkeeper was suddenly pointed at by a sharp knife. The shopkeeper quickly raised his hands, turned around slowly, and [Qin Gui] heard the sound and looked outside. The next second, the shopkeeper appeared at the door, scaring [Qin Gui] to take a sharp breath.
1:19:48|1:19:52|The shopkeeper nodded, [Qin Gui] was about to slip out the door.
1:19:55|1:20:3|Qin Gui stood sideways with his back to the shopkeeper, slowly walking while taking off his hat to cover his face. The shopkeeper looked at him in confusion from behind.
1:20:10|1:20:22|Qin Gui took the photo, exclaimed in shock, and used the photo to cover his face. Zuo Zuomu stood up in confusion, moved the photo blocking Qin Gui's face with his hand. Qin Gui, feeling guilty, smiled awkwardly.
1:20:22|1:20:28|Ichiro Zuo compared Qin Gui to the photo, and Qin Gui was so scared that he quickly held the photo in front of his face.
1:20:33|1:20:40|Qin Gui patted Qin Gui and took out a package.
1:21:7|1:21:21|Qin Gui, reciting a mantra silently, knocked down Zuo Zuomu with a punch, sending him flying and hanging upside down on a cabinet. Meanwhile, the escaped Qin Gui passed by Uncle Shunzi and the other two, when suddenly Uncle Shunzi noticed Qin Gui.
1:21:31|1:21:50|Suddenly, the youngest of the three covered Qin Gui's mouth and dragged him away. At the door, the youngest was hugged by Zuo Zuomu, while Qin Gui, whose mouth was covered, anxiously looked at Zuo Zuomu mistaking him for someone else.
1:22:18|1:22:41|Three people followed [Qin Gui] into the courtyard. The ugly man, [Ah Ying] and [Qin Gui] with the package, were blocked by [Uncle Shunzi] and two others.
1:22:54|1:23:7|[Qin Gui] watched as [Zuo Zuomu] took out an identical small package, his eyes widening. Holding the package, [Qin Gui] walked step by step towards [Uncle Shunzi] and the others, solemnly handing the package to [Uncle Shunzi] and speaking.
1:23:11|1:23:21|Suddenly, a member of the Eighth Route Army approached, pointing a gun at them. Erzhu walked towards Uncle Shunzi in surprise, looking at the package in his hands.
1:23:43|1:23:50|On the other side, the Eighth Route Army opened the package, and Qin Gui looked at the attack map, speaking with a puzzled expression.
1:24:11|1:24:29|[Zuo Zuomu] stopped, lowering his head nervously. He cast his eyes down and, before leaving, didn't forget the songbook on the table that he cherished. Turning around, he paused for a moment, then quietly picked up the songbook behind him, tucked it into his chest, and, leaning on his cane, walked unsteadily towards the door with one fist and one crutch.
1:24:29|1:24:35|Thus, the battle between the common people and the Japanese army ended with the victory of the common people.
