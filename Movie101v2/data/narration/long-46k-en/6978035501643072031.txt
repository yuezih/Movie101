0:0:49|0:1:14|Bombers dropped bombs one after another, landing on the battlefield, soldiers were blown up and shattered on the spot. Meanwhile, [Mu Liangfeng], who was dozing off in the woods, was awakened by an annoying fly. As smoke billowed on the battlefield and faced with the enemy's carpet bombing, the only option was to flee. Carefree on a tree branch, [Mu Liangfeng] woke up from a beautiful dream. With his amazing eyesight, he immediately spotted the prey's location.
0:1:14|0:1:50|A wild boar foraging, aiming his hunting rifle at the prey about to pull the trigger, when a plane crashes, casting a huge shadow over the treetops. [Mu Liangfeng] on the tree is also shaken down. The plane grazes the treetops and crashes on the hillside. [Mu Liangfeng], getting up, quickly goes after the startled wild boar.
0:1:52|0:2:18|He pulled the trigger but missed, the wild boar was rampaging in the woods. Another shot hit the boar in the neck, causing it to fall straight down. As he approached the boar, he noticed the situation with the plane. Looking over, he saw someone climbing out of the fiery wreckage. [Mu Liangfeng] abandoned the boar in front of him and hurriedly ran towards the hillside.
0:2:18|0:2:39|In the cockpit of the plane, a foreigner crawled out with blood all over his face. He vaguely saw a figure rushing towards him. [Mu Liangfeng] ran up quickly, slid down beside him, took out a dagger to cut the safety belt. The fire near the plane's fuel tank grew bigger and bigger. [Mu Liangfeng] didn't dare to be careless. Finally, the safety belt was cut. He grabbed the foreign pilot's shoulder and dragged him out.
0:2:39|0:2:50|Unexpectedly noticing the pistol held by the pilot, [Mu Liangfeng] picked up the pistol and kicked it into his arms. A buzzing sound came from the fuel tank. He struggled to prop up the pilot's arm and ran down the hillside.
0:2:56|0:3:5|The huge impact of the explosion knocked the two people over, blasting piles of leaflets out of the cabin. [Mu Liangfeng] slowly got up from the haystack.
0:3:7|0:3:24|The intense explosion made him dizzy. On a nearby haystack, the barely conscious pilot was pleading for help to [Mu Liangfeng]. [Mu Liangfeng] glanced at him but ignored him. However, as he took a few steps, he saw the half-dead wild boar and turned back.
0:3:25|0:3:32|The pilot shouted and then lay still. [Mu Liangfeng] glanced at the wild boar, then at him, struggled for a moment, and walked towards the foreign pilot.
0:3:32|0:3:58|He grabbed his arm, hung it over his shoulder, and twisted his waist with force. [Mu Liangfeng] painfully supported his waist and stood up, fiercely kicked the unconscious pilot, then lifted his legs and dragged him. Bullets from a sniper rifle fell one by one, slowly revealing the title: "Wolves Everywhere". In Fengling Ferry Town, the main road into the town was bustling.
0:3:58|0:4:7|In the crowd, everyone was carrying their belongings, including some injured soldiers. [Mu Liangfeng] was carrying a pilot and catching up with the crowd.
0:4:27|0:4:44|A woman handed the coachman some banknotes. In the small town, the sign of the Smoke Willow Teahouse gradually became clear. After a lot of effort, the coachman finally pushed the carriage into the teahouse. In the teahouse at night, [Mu Liangfeng] couldn't chamber a round no matter how hard he tried with the hunting rifle.
0:5:21|0:5:29|[Liu Yan] turned and went into the inner room, where several patients were lying on the makeshift beds.
0:5:34|0:5:38|Mu Liangfeng in the outer room looked at Liu Yan, sneaking bites of the pastries on the table while trying to secretly stuff some into his arms.
0:5:41|0:5:55|Outside the teahouse, the rain was pouring down heavily, while inside, it was a mess with refugees lying all over the place, including [Mu Liangfeng]. He was lying in bed playing with the pistol he had acquired during the day, really liking the gun and even chuckled as he polished it until it gleamed.
0:5:56|0:6:9|In the bed, he wriggled his body, vigorously wiping the gun barrel with his cuff, causing the tea house waitress to cough. [Mu Liangfeng] turned over, afraid of disturbing others. Just as he was about to take out the gun to play with it, he saw a little boy.
0:6:13|0:6:29|The sudden voice startled Mu Liangfeng, causing him to drop the gun in his hand. He quickly turned around to pick up the gun and bullets to hand them to the person speaking. Yes, it was the pilot who had woken up.
0:6:51|0:7:8|The pilot handed the pistol to [Mu Liangfeng], saying, [Mu Liangfeng] took the pistol with delight, removed the magazine, reloaded it, and under the bright moonlight, [Mu Liangfeng] observed the exquisite gun body.
0:7:14|0:7:36|In the field, [Mu Liangfeng] held the gun with one arm, and John placed an eggshell on the gun barrel. There was also a brick tied to [Mu Liangfeng]'s arm with a rope, which was John's deliberate training to improve his gun grip stability. Next came the shooting segment, [Mu Liangfeng] raised his hand, aimed the gun, and fired in one go.
0:7:38|0:8:6|In the distance, not a single tomato on the scarecrow's arms was hit. John took the gun, one hand holding it and the other supporting it, his movements natural and relaxed. [Mu Liangfeng] shook his head in confusion. John held the gun with both hands, smoothly sliding left and right, like a graceful waltz. Suddenly, he accelerated, shattering the tomato into pieces. He looked towards [Mu Liangfeng].
0:8:8|0:8:14|[Mu Liangfeng] was completely convinced by this teacher. That afternoon, John had just thrown his luggage onto the off-road vehicle.
0:8:25|0:8:53|[Mu Liangfeng] ran over with a small teacup in his hands and knelt down on one knee. [Liu Yan] followed suit with a gesture of invitation. John picked up the teacup with both hands, took a sip, and then helped [Mu Liangfeng] up along with [Liu Yan]. He sincerely said, [Mu Liangfeng] tightly held John's hand and shook it vigorously to express his reluctance. John put his arm around his shoulder and patted him a few times, and [Mu Liangfeng] imitated the action. The two men together conveyed their pure feelings.
0:8:53|0:9:2|The car started, [Mu Liangfeng] got in, marking the end of this brief yet profound friendship. [Mu Liangfeng] waved his hand,
0:9:3|0:9:15|John in the car took a photo of the two people and waved to them, fate made people of disparate identities become good friends. [Liu Yan] took the lead to go back to take care of the teahouse, leaving the clueless [Mu Liangfeng] behind.
0:10:25|0:10:31|Mu Liangfeng stabbed him in the thigh with a single stroke.
0:10:34|0:10:59|Mu Liangfeng dodged the teapot thrown by the soldier, slashed another one rushing towards him, then got punched and knocked down. As more soldiers swarmed in, Mu Liangfeng found himself overwhelmed. Despite managing to throw one soldier halfway out the window, he was caught off guard by a sneak attack with a stool, causing him to fall under the table. At that moment, another soldier emerged from behind, grabbing his neck and dragging him backwards.
0:11:0|0:11:6|Knocking over the teapot and causing the tea set to fall to the ground, [Mu Liangfeng] quickly found himself subdued by the soldiers.
0:11:27|0:11:52|A group of soldiers pressed [Mu Liangfeng] towards the truck without hesitation. [Liu Yan] and the teahouse waiter could only watch helplessly as [Mu Liangfeng] was taken away. The truck slowly drove out of the small town, with beautiful scenery in the mountains. The tranquil lakeside exuded peace, and the sheep leisurely grazed on the grass. Two military trucks raced on the road in the mountains. The long journey made the soldiers guarding [Mu Liangfeng] doze off, but [Mu Liangfeng] was alert at this moment. He stared intently at the sniper rifle in the soldier's hands.
0:11:53|0:11:59|The soldier struck [Mu Liangfeng] in the face with a punch, then showed his authority by stabbing a knife into the wooden box.
0:11:59|0:12:13|The truck just drove up the hill when it encountered an accident. The truck driver was shot dead, and then the truck lost power and crashed into a small river. Inside the truck, [Mu Liangfeng] and the soldiers were thrown around. The soldiers jumped off the truck one after another, trying to transfer to another vehicle.
0:12:13|0:12:23|Mu Liangfeng, who was in the carriage, looked around in confusion as two soldiers were shot and killed as soon as they got off the car and fell into the small river. The captain next to another truck opened the door and lay down, followed closely by the soldiers.
0:12:31|0:12:46|A soldier protecting him was shot in the head, and before dying, he handed the gun to [Mu Liangfeng]. Another truck driver was also killed, and a brave soldier leaned against the truck, waiting for the opportunity to counterattack.
0:12:47|0:13:6|As soon as the words fell, a shot hit him in the head, followed by another shot that blew his brains out. Inside the carriage, [Mu Liangfeng] realized the seriousness of the situation. He used a small knife stuck in a wooden box to continuously rub the hemp rope around his wrist. Two trucks tilted on the side of the road, the soldiers looked tense, not daring to move recklessly. The captain held a gun and slowly moved it, observing the enemy through the window.
0:13:7|0:13:21|He initially judged that the enemy was on the opposite mountain. Soldier Xiao Fang lost his life to save Mu Liangfeng, while Mu Liangfeng in the carriage had just untied himself and quickly picked up the sniper rifle on the ground.
0:13:23|0:13:32|The soldier received orders, took a deep breath, and then crouched down as he rushed forward along the riverbank. Despite his efforts, he was still shot in the head by the enemy.
0:13:42|0:13:52|The captain, in a fit of anger, kicked him down. Inside the carriage, [Mu Liangfeng] used a small knife to cut open the cloth curtain, then slowly handed out the muzzle of the sniper rifle. [Mu Liangfeng] searched for the enemy on the opposite hill through the scope.
0:13:58|0:14:23|The two soldiers rushed out, one after the other, with one of them running a few steps and lying down by the river. [Mu Liangfeng] loaded the sniper rifle, while the other soldier slowly moved by the carriage. [Mu Liangfeng] licked his index finger and placed it on the trigger, then slowly lowered the muzzle, aiming at a huge rock. He remained calm and composed, waiting for the best moment to shoot. The enemy's scope was constantly monitoring the situation of the truck, and a black dot faintly appeared among the ordinary weeds, right at the enemy's muzzle.
0:14:23|0:14:49|Even if you get close, it's hard to notice. At this moment, wearing camouflage, he is staring intently at the truck in the distance. The soldiers behind the truck are in position. With the captain's command, two soldiers run along the stream, one in front and one behind. [Mu Liangfeng], who is lying in ambush in the car, sees the muzzle flame. Holding his breath, he aims and pulls the trigger. The Japanese soldiers in the jungle start to flee, one of them who just ran a few steps away falls to the ground with a shot from afar. Almost being hit, [Mu Liangfeng] crouches, takes two quick steps, jumps out of the car, and lands in the stream.
0:14:49|0:15:12|He recalled John teaching him the fusion of marksmanship and speed, taking the first shot at the ambushed sniper. The enemy promptly changed tactics, jumping out of the woods and shooting while running along the hillside. [Mu Liangfeng] also maneuvered skillfully by the stream. In this game of wits, [Mu Liangfeng] ultimately prevailed. Despite the enemy he had taken down, [Mu Liangfeng] remained vigilant, aiming his sniper rifle.
0:15:12|0:15:23|Until he confirmed the loss of breath, [Mu Liangfeng] only then took his hand off the trigger. He slowly lowered the sniper rifle, and suddenly a bullet hit the enemy's head. [Mu Liangfeng] turned around, it turned out to be the captain.
0:15:25|0:15:29|Mu Liangfeng hesitated for a moment with the gun in hand, then reluctantly put down the sniper rifle.
0:15:29|0:15:47|In the night training camp, soldiers were practicing shooting. [Mu Liangfeng] was being closely guarded inside the house. As he looked outside, soldiers were carrying wounded comrades on stretchers. The battle during the day was only a narrow victory. At that moment, the camp leader accompanied another officer and approached.
0:16:5|0:16:30|The captain snatched the gun from the guard, chambered a round, and pressed it against his head. [Mu Liangfeng] stood his ground, staring directly at the captain. The captain handed the gun back to the guard, saying, "Apparently, [Mu Liangfeng] is more interested in guns."
0:16:48|0:16:54|Captain Mu Liangfeng walked over at this moment. Sniper Company Commander Meng Zi stepped forward and saluted, and the captain returned the salute.
0:17:30|0:17:36|After Meng Zi slung the gun on his back, he grabbed Mu Liangfeng's arms and placed Mu Liangfeng's hands in his own palms.
0:17:50|0:18:8|[Meng Zi] hits [Mu Liangfeng]'s hand after every sentence he says. This time, [Mu Liangfeng] was clever and managed to dodge it again.
0:18:9|0:18:24|[Meng Zi] said, showing a relieved smile, while [Mu Liangfeng] still pouted angrily, looking at [Meng Zi] with disbelief. He recalled that someone used to play this game with him when he was young. [Meng Zi] had to admit that he did see potential in [Mu Liangfeng]. Then he turned and walked to the captain not far away, saying:
0:19:15|0:19:31|[Mu Liangfeng] listened in on the battle deployment. On that day, the flag of Japanese militarism fluttered in the wind, and the Japanese army was training in the alleys of Jingzhou City, while the prisoner-of-war camp next to it was still giving a speech.
0:19:46|0:20:6|A group of soldiers are executing prisoners, and the Nationalist soldiers in the crowd are filled with sorrow but cannot act out. The speaker looks embarrassed, gazing at the prisoners below the stage. The prisoners, each wearing a different outfit, all have the same sign hanging around their necks, indicating their crimes. A Japanese soldier takes advantage of the inspection to touch a woman in a qipao, even reaching into her skirt.
0:20:6|0:20:30|The woman's husband arrived but was hit in the face with the butt of a gun. The Japanese soldier next to him grabbed [Mu Liangfeng], searched his body. The camp leader not far away was secretly anxious, the inspecting Japanese soldier searched him thoroughly from top to bottom. A military vehicle arrived, and the person sitting inside was the target. [Mu Liangfeng] standing for inspection made eye contact with him until the Japanese soldier approved the passage. The camp leader finally breathed a sigh of relief in the crowd.
0:20:49|0:21:10|The nurse who was bandaging wounds saw Zheng Ye standing at the door. She walked quickly towards him, and Zheng Ye smiled at her. The nurse asked why Zheng Ye, who should be in Jingshan, was here. Zheng Ye didn't answer, but took out a paper cherry blossom from behind. The Japanese soldiers who were treating the wounded looked gloomy. Outside the door, Zheng Ye reached out from behind with a package and wished the nurse a happy birthday.
0:21:27|0:21:30|But when asked about this unpleasant matter, it immediately triggered memories of the night when [Zheng Ye] carried out the execution.
0:21:58|0:22:15|[Zheng Ye] stood still, his face twisted in anger. The nurse put the gift he gave on the bench next to him and walked away. In the evening corridor, the nurse walked towards the ward. Enraged, [Zheng Ye] roared that the nurse must have changed her mind. Later that night on the streets of Jingzhou, the Japanese patrol marched in unison.
0:22:25|0:22:49|Inside the iron gate is a granary, the platoon leader tears open the jute bags containing grain, and rice pours out. He takes out a sniper rifle prepared in advance and hands it to the soldiers. [Mu Liangfeng] takes the gun, eagerly tearing open the parcel of parchment paper. [Meng Zi] distributes target photos to everyone, and [Mu Liangfeng], who receives the photo, looks somewhat unhappy.
0:22:54|0:23:1|[Mu Liangfeng] approached the platoon leader and said discontentedly:
0:23:25|0:23:34|After [Meng Zi] finished speaking, he reached out to grab the sniper rifle from [Mu Liangfeng]. He firmly held onto the gun and didn't give [Meng Zi] a chance. [Meng Zi] pulled out a photo from his pocket and threw it in.
0:23:40|0:24:3|The scene shifts, [Meng Zi] pushes his bicycle to the front of the old building, while the soldiers quickly run up the stairs. Outside the building is the Japanese patrol team, as the soldiers search for suitable sniping positions.
0:24:5|0:24:32|In this run-down building, overlooking the Japanese headquarters across the street, [Mu Liangfeng] was leaning on the windowsill with a gun in hand, looking out. At this moment, Xiao Wu walked up the tower's spiral staircase. Upstairs, Xiao Wu, who was getting up for the night, saw [Mu Liangfeng] at the window. [Mu Liangfeng] was moving the gun up, down, left, and right, practicing the shooting technique John had taught him. Inside the room, [Meng Zi] was sitting in a chair, holding a gun and a cigarette, looking carefully as if reminiscing about his military career.
0:24:32|0:24:56|Under the window sill, [Mu Liangfeng] secretly applied lipstick to himself. Tonight, the bright moon hung in the sky, with no wind or clouds in sight. [Mu Liangfeng] tilted his head and stood by the bed, gazing at the night sky. Suddenly, he remembered the pastry he had secretly brought from the teahouse. He reached into his pocket and took it out. This treat was a rare delicacy for him. Just as he was about to put the pastry in his mouth, [Mu Liangfeng] noticed some movement outside.
0:24:57|0:25:11|He looked through the scope of the gun and saw a figure in white on the stairs of the Japanese headquarters in the distance. As he heard a noise behind him, he immediately turned around, even dropping the pastry on the ground.
0:25:15|0:25:22|Xiao Wu divided the sweet potato in half and handed one half to [Mu Liangfeng]. [Mu Liangfeng] took the sweet potato with embarrassment and said:
0:27:38|0:27:52|Upon seeing Xiao Wu so relieved, [Mu Liangfeng] also smiled. The next day, Xiao Wu, dressed in a small suit, holding a sniper rifle with a loaded chamber, stared closely at the Japanese headquarters from the old building.
0:27:53|0:28:9|At the same time, Sergeant [Meng Zi] found a high point. He crouched behind the pigeon cage, with the barrel of his gun poking through the cage's iron mesh, attentively observing the movements on the opposite side. On the other side, [Mu Liangfeng] was feeling sleepy due to keeping watch. Although he had a gun propped up by the window, he was already starting to feel drowsy.
0:28:9|0:28:20|Meng Zi in the pigeon cage pulled the trigger and waited for the right moment. The streets of Jingzhou were sparsely populated, with a faint sense of killing intent in the air.
0:28:20|0:28:44|At this moment, the Japanese military motorcycles were leading the way, followed by a luxury car slowly approaching. The prominent flag of Japanese militarism fluttered in the wind. Inside the old building, [Mu Liangfeng] was dozing off, his face almost hitting the gun butt. Suddenly, he woke up, lifted his head, and saw the target vehicle slowly stopping at the entrance of the Japanese military headquarters. [Meng Zi] placed his index finger on the trigger, waiting for the opportunity as the target had already disembarked.
0:28:44|0:29:8|Mu Liangfeng, with a loaded gun, stared into the distance. He licked his index finger and placed it on the trigger, while keeping his sight aimed at Liu Yan's head. His comrades also aimed at their targets. Just then, Liu Yan, who had gotten off the car, noticed an open window in the old building across the street. He then returned to the car to look for something.
0:29:11|0:29:25|On the high platform, four Japanese soldiers drew their swords and shouted "Long live the Emperor." Unexpectedly, [Liu Yan] only found a telescope from the car. Through the telescope, he spotted [Mu Liangfeng] hiding in the building. He immediately reported to the Japanese soldiers. Worried that the Japanese soldiers would escape, [Mu Liangfeng] immediately opened fire.
0:29:27|0:29:57|On another building, [Xiao Wen] also pulled the trigger, completely disrupting the plan. At this point, [Meng Zi] also bravely stepped forward. [Mu Liangfeng] pulled the bolt and aimed at the enemy. After the gunshot, the Japanese officers fell one by one. At the same time, they also spotted the group's location. The Japanese soldiers aimed and opened fire. [Xiao Wen] cursed under his breath and ran away with the platoon leader. The determined [Mu Liangfeng] aimed at the officer inside the car.
0:29:58|0:30:21|A shot pierced through his skull, [Xiao Wen] quickly flew down the stairs, casually throwing away the sniper rifle on the rooftop. The street was in chaos, with the people hiding in every direction. At the door, [Xiao Shun] noticed that the Japanese troops had arrived, so he turned around and ambushed them as they broke in, causing heavy casualties. With [Xiao Shun] providing cover, [Meng Zi] flipped down from the stairs to dodge the bullets. At that moment, as [Mu Liangfeng] prepared to descend the stairs, he noticed that the enemy had already arrived downstairs.
0:30:24|0:30:48|With just one shot fired, he was suppressed by enemy fire. The alarm was sounded, and [Xiao Wen] escaped to the edge of the rooftop and looked down. [Xiao Shun], pushing a bicycle, called out to him. Without hesitation, [Xiao Wen] flipped outside the building, slid down a tight banner, but unexpectedly, the Japanese soldiers arrived. Quick-witted [Xiao Shun] fired the first shot, while [Xiao Wen] held onto the banner with one hand and pulled out his gun to shoot with the other. However, the Japanese soldiers charged forward with submachine guns, breaking the banner.
0:30:48|0:31:3|[Xiao Shun] hid behind the wooden box and counterattacked, but at this moment, [Xiao Wen] without the banner fell from the sky. Fortunately, he landed on the construction soil. [Xiao Shun] quickly ran over to help him up, and the two rushed towards the prepared bicycle, pushing it to leave.
0:31:3|0:31:26|In the Japanese army headquarters office, a guard ran in to wake up the drunken lieutenant. The lieutenant on the chair opened his eyes groggily, listened for a moment, and then heard the alarm clearly. He immediately got up and went to the balcony, where he saw civilians fleeing and a pursuing Japanese soldier being shot down. The lieutenant walked quickly back into the room and clapped his hands. The guard threw a sniper rifle to him across the room, and the lieutenant caught it. He went back to the balcony, aimed, and fired.
0:31:28|0:31:36|[Xiao Shun] and [Xiao Wen] are riding a bike, pushing and fighting at the same time. Shao Zuo has already locked onto him.
0:31:43|0:32:2|[Xiao Shun] was shot in the head and lost his breath. As the pursuing Japanese soldiers arrived, [Xiao Wen]'s marksmanship was extraordinary. After killing two Japanese soldiers in a row, he attempted to drag [Xiao Shun] away. With the Japanese firepower fully unleashed, [Xiao Wen] could only save himself and escape. A soldier was targeted, and the lieutenant colonel once again pulled the trigger to take his life.
0:32:3|0:32:11|[Meng Zi] greeted the soldiers and rode the bike frantically. They arrived at a corner and were surrounded again. [Meng Zi] raised his hand and shot two enemies dead.
0:32:11|0:32:30|Unexpectedly, a military motorcycle approached, with a soldier holding a submachine gun firing wildly. Taking cover behind a pillar, [Meng Zi] suddenly lay down and shot him dead. The motorcycle lost control and crashed by the roadside. Seizing the opportunity, Meng Zi and the others fled into the hospital. As they ran frantically through the corridors, they hadn't figured out the direction yet when the Japanese military motorcycle smashed through the glass and charged in. They had no choice but to turn around and run.
0:32:30|0:32:39|The Japanese army discovered them and began shooting wildly. The walls of the hospital were riddled with bullet holes. Two people hid around the corner as a soldier pulled out a grenade, removed the safety pin, and threw it.
0:32:42|0:32:58|The explosion generated a huge impact, knocking over the Japanese soldiers. Seizing the opportunity, [Meng Zi] dragged a soldier and fled in another direction. Meanwhile, [Xiao Wen], running with sweat pouring down his back, hid behind a wall. More and more Japanese soldiers filled the street, blocking the road and starting to search the civilians. A soldier spotted the two of them, [Meng Zi].
0:33:3|0:33:7|Mu Liangfeng and Liu Yan not only did not run away but instead rushed forward to meet the enemy, quickly resolving the situation.
0:33:11|0:33:39|Meng Zi shot through the palm of the Japanese soldier, then took his life with another shot. While Mu Liangfeng was still fleeing on the rooftop, unfamiliar with the terrain, he reached the boundary of two buildings. Looking down, he saw the Japanese soldiers passing below. With no way out, he took a deep breath and leaped into the window across the way. In the dimly lit corridor, Mu Liangfeng ran for his life. For some reason, he felt like the wild boar that had been shot by a hunting rifle back then.
0:33:39|0:33:58|He was panting heavily, holding a sniper rifle, blindly running, and unknowingly ran to a staircase about to go downstairs, where he was blocked by two Japanese soldiers. The sound of the falling shell was crisp, like the sound of wind chimes. In the teahouse, Liu Yan looked nervously at the wind chimes, even her hands, which were arranging flowers and grass, stopped.
0:33:58|0:34:11|On the other side, [Mu Liangfeng] has escaped from the building, with the Japanese troops closing in. The sniper rifle's rate of fire is limited, after firing two shots, [Mu Liangfeng] can only flee, but it's a dead end.
0:34:11|0:34:19|[Mu Liangfeng] leaned against the wall, preparing for a desperate fight. The Japanese soldiers outside were cocking their guns and approaching slowly, and [Mu Liangfeng] was also prepared for close combat.
0:34:19|0:34:39|Two Japanese soldiers quickened their pace with determination. [Mu Liangfeng] tightly gripped his gun, taking a deep breath to adjust his state. Suddenly, he looked up along the wall and saw an old lady on the second-floor window. The old lady gently moved the flowerpot on the windowsill. [Mu Liangfeng] immediately understood and nodded towards the old lady. Just as the Japanese soldiers were caught off guard, a flowerpot fell from the sky.
0:34:42|0:34:50|The two were attracted, and in an instant, [Mu Liangfeng] shot and killed one of them, while the other had a flying knife stuck in his head.
0:34:51|0:35:15|He had just stepped forward to pull out the flying knife when the Japanese army arrived and blocked the north and south routes. [Mu Liangfeng] rushed into a dead end, banging on a civilian house. A hand from inside pulled him in. Just as [Mu Liangfeng] was about to resist, the footsteps of the Japanese army could be heard outside. A group of people took [Mu Liangfeng] and fled, but the Japanese army was not willing to let them off easily.
0:35:15|0:35:30|They threw the body into the water, walked through the streets and alleys with military dogs. The lieutenant picked up the bullet casings left by the Nationalist Army in the old building, examining them carefully. It was the Springfield M1903 sniper rifle, which was not unfamiliar to him. The guard beside him reminded:
0:35:45|0:36:5|The guard received the order, while Lieutenant Colonel looked out the window and soon discovered the clue, which was the pastry dropped by [Mu Liangfeng] last night. The Lieutenant Colonel bent down to pick up the pastry, observing it with great annoyance. In his eyes, this was a blatant provocation. The guard approached, and the Lieutenant Colonel slowly turned around. The guard presented a letter, and the Lieutenant Colonel calmly accepted it.
0:36:5|0:36:14|When he noticed that it was sent by the young nurse, he opened it eagerly. The letter was written by the young nurse on the day they had a quarrel, and it said:
0:36:46|0:36:51|On the other side, [Meng Zi] and the others arrived at the bamboo forest.
0:37:14|0:37:28|The remaining soldiers checked their weapons and equipment, while Xiao Wu, who was urinating nearby, spotted a light in the distance. It turned out to be the pursuers' motorcycles heading towards them. Xiao Wu was startled and held back his urine. [Meng Zi], who was always vigilant, looked in the direction pointed by Xiao Wu's finger.
0:37:31|0:37:52|The Japanese army noticed the movement and shouted to stop the car. The sniper team in the dark had already set up their positions, locking onto the Japanese soldiers. As the Japanese soldiers turned the motorcycle's headlight swept over, catching Xiao Wu off guard, exposing half of his head. [Meng Zi] acted first, smashing one of the Japanese car lights. In return, the Japanese soldiers opened fire, putting our troops in a passive position.
0:37:52|0:38:0|On the other side, a group of guerrillas rushed in. The ambushed Japanese soldiers quickly fell down. The last Japanese soldier had just pulled the pin of a grenade but was shot dead before he could throw it.
0:38:3|0:38:10|Hiding under the hill, [Meng Zi] and the others had not yet figured out the situation, let alone who the newcomers were.
0:38:46|0:38:59|After the guerrilla team's instructions, they left the bamboo forest. [Meng Zi] knocked down [Mu Liangfeng] with a punch, and his comrades helped him up.
0:39:6|0:39:36|Mu Liangfeng, puzzled and annoyed, turned around. At this moment, another comrade approached, and without hesitation, Mu Liangfeng knocked him down with a punch. Mu Liangfeng then reached out to help the comrade up. The soldiers in the National Army tent applauded warmly, and the commander handed a silver note to Meng Zi, who accepted it with both hands and saluted.
0:39:40|0:39:45|[Mu Liangfeng] had already prepared his military uniform early, waiting for tonight. A smile crept onto his lips.
0:40:6|0:40:10|[Mu Liangfeng] opened the letter in confusion, forgetting that he couldn't read.
0:41:4|0:41:18|[Mu Liangfeng] looked at Xiao Wu in confusion, while Xiao Wu raised an eyebrow curiously. A smiling A Gui on the side made Mu Liangfeng, who looked bewildered, amuse Xiao Wu. A Gui said:
0:41:33|0:41:56|Comrades left one after another. On a beautiful day, [Mu Liangfeng] rode his bicycle back to Fenglingdu Town, where he was warmly welcomed by everyone. As he returned triumphantly to the town, even walking in the fields, he was admired by groups of children. Grandpa also walked to the door to greet him. [Mu Liangfeng], dressed in military uniform and carrying a gun on his back, ran up.
0:43:10|0:43:34|[Mu Liangfeng] turned and left. The old man stared at the burnt banknotes in the brazier, lost in thought. Just as [Mu Liangfeng] was about to leave the courtyard, the old man called out to him and chased after him. [Mu Liangfeng] turned around, and the old man handed him a small package. [Mu Liangfeng] carefully took it and opened it, revealing a handgun. Upon closer inspection, he realized it was the same one that belonged to John.
0:43:39|0:44:3|The old man took the gun and looked at the loaded bullets, saying: [Mu Liangfeng] took the gun from his grandfather's hand. The old man's eyes revealed a transcendent gaze. [Mu Liangfeng] nodded, his eyes red as he slowly stepped back and left. [Mu Liangfeng] also knew that his grandson had grown up and could not be kept anymore.
0:44:3|0:44:14|On the path of Fengling Ferry, [Mu Liangfeng] rode his bicycle, pondering over his grandfather's words. Suddenly, he slowed down, as if he had forgotten something important. After stopping the bike to think for a while, he turned back.
0:44:14|0:44:23|Er Wa is wiping the table in the teahouse, while Mu Liangfeng pushes a cart towards the door under the cover of night. When he reaches the entrance, Mu Liangfeng stops and parks his bicycle with his back facing the door.
0:44:39|0:44:52|[Mu Liangfeng] gently placed the sniper rifle down, and at that moment, [Liu Yan] came down from the second floor. She was stunned to see [Mu Liangfeng] in military uniform, so much so that he looked exactly like her ex-husband.
0:44:53|0:45:10|[Liu Yan] thought to herself, recalling her ex-husband dancing with her at the ball. She couldn't help but say, "I'm coming down the stairs quickly," as [Mu Liangfeng] also stood up.
0:45:34|0:45:55|[Mu Liangfeng] sat down nervously, while [Liu Yan] poured hot tea. She pointed to her lips, and [Mu Liangfeng] blushed and lowered his head. [Liu Yan] brought the hot tea over and brewed another cup for [Mu Liangfeng], who then slowly drank it.
0:46:8|0:46:22|[Mu Liangfeng] stood up excitedly and said, "It's pouring rain outside." He slung the sniper rifle over his shoulder and continued, "[Er Wa], go close the door." [Mu Liangfeng] glanced at the heavy rain outside the window.
0:46:38|0:47:2|On the second floor, [Mu Liangfeng] followed [Liu Yan] into the room. He looked around at the furnishings, while [Liu Yan] walked towards the inner room holding a mat. [Mu Liangfeng], holding a quilt, was drawn to a photo on the wall, which was a picture of [Liu Yan] and her ex-husband. [Liu Yan] spread out the mat on the floor, and [Mu Liangfeng] nodded in agreement. Outside the teahouse, a torrential rain poured down with thunder rumbling. The wind chimes on the floor caught the attention of [Mu Liangfeng].
0:47:2|0:47:24|He leaned forward and looked behind the screen, where [Liu Yan] was already asleep, moonlight shining on her delicate profile. Unable to resist, [Mu Liangfeng] gazed at her a little longer. Perhaps due to the drop in temperature, the dreaming [Liu Yan] tugged at the blanket. [Mu Liangfeng] slowly lay down, unable to help but think of the group photo taken today, the one with the man in military uniform and [Liu Yan].
0:47:24|0:47:48|In the early morning sunlight, [Mu Liangfeng] slowly opened his eyes to see a beautiful pillowcase embroidered with a pair of flying swallows. The record player lay in a lovely wooden box, spinning gently. [Mu Liangfeng] lightly touched the embroidered swallows with his fingers, depicting vivid birds and best wishes. [Liu Yan] sat at the table, nodding at [Mu Liangfeng].
0:47:56|0:48:21|After [Liu Yan] finished speaking, she got up and walked to the window, pulling back the curtains. The sunlight fell on [Mu Liangfeng]'s face, slightly dazzling. As [Liu Yan]'s fingertips slid over the wind chimes, [Mu Liangfeng] sat up. Hearing the movement, [Liu Yan] turned around, only to see the flustered [Mu Liangfeng] hastily wrapping himself in a blanket. He grabbed his pants and put them on under the blanket. When [Liu Yan] regained her composure, she saw the awkward [Mu Liangfeng] struggling to put on his pants, which made her burst into laughter.
0:48:21|0:48:35|She turned and went downstairs to spare Mu Liangfeng from further embarrassment. By noon, Er Wa brought a bicycle to Mu Liangfeng at the teahouse entrance, and Liu Yan also saw him off.
0:48:35|0:48:53|[Mu Liangfeng] shyly said, while [Liu Yan] gently embraced him at the moment of parting. [Mu Liangfeng] looked complicated, and the Nationalist soldiers drinking tea on the side watched the scene, as if worried about gossip. [Liu Yan] then stepped back.
0:48:53|0:49:9|[Liu Yan] ran into the house with her long skirt, while the National Army soldiers on the side were discussing the actions of the two. [Mu Liangfeng] glared disapprovingly, and the soldiers immediately restrained their expressions. [Liu Yan] hurried over and handed the hunting rifle to [Mu Liangfeng], who took it. Then [Liu Yan] took out a military water bottle.
0:49:20|0:49:28|[Liu Yan] helped him carry it on his body, and also helped him tidy up his clothes casually. [Mu Liangfeng] gazed at [Liu Yan] foolishly, then touched the hunting rifle and said:
0:49:38|0:49:59|[Mu Liangfeng] handed the hunting rifle with both hands, [Liu Yan] took it and saluted, [Mu Liangfeng] also followed with a standard military salute. The two smiled and nodded at each other, their eyes showing reluctance and encouragement respectively. [Mu Liangfeng] mounted the bicycle, slowly rode away under [Liu Yan]'s gaze. Pedaling through the crowd, [Mu Liangfeng] felt extremely happy.
0:49:59|0:50:12|He looked back at the teahouse of [Liu Yan] and gave her a bright smile. [Liu Yan] gazed at his back, reminiscing about him. The last time he left, he was also smiling. That time, he never came back.
0:50:12|0:50:33|[Liu Yan] showed a melancholy expression, feeling empty inside. She tightly held the hunting rifle left by [Mu Liangfeng], unsure of what the future held. Perhaps it was the military uniform that made it hard for her to distinguish between the two. The sound of a bell rang out, and [Liu Yan] looked up. [Mu Liangfeng] in the crowd happened to be looking back at her. [Liu Yan] stared at that figure until it disappeared at the end of the road.
0:50:35|0:50:57|On the small bridge, [Mu Liangfeng] is riding a bike and drinking water from a water bottle, while on the other side, [Liu Yan] brings out a large plate of pastries. Meanwhile, at a tattoo shop, the tattoo artist is drawing a pair of flying swallows on [Mu Liangfeng]'s chest. Inside the oven, [Liu Yan] brings in another plate of pastries. As the tattoo artist finishes the final touches, the pair of swallows on his chest looks vivid and lifelike under the afternoon sunlight. [Mu Liangfeng] finishes drinking the water from the bottle.
0:50:57|0:51:26|On the side, the child mocked her. [Mu Liangfeng] put down the water pot, pulled open her clothes, revealing the swallow on her chest muscles. The child was not scared, while [Liu Yan] was still busy. [Er Wa] walked over with a tea tray and saw the joy cakes. [Er Wa] shyly waved her hand and left, making [Liu Yan] couldn't help but laugh. She repeatedly pressed the pastry with her palm, when suddenly the sound of wind chimes came.
0:51:31|0:51:35|Looking at the table full of wedding cakes, she recalled her beautiful memories. 
0:51:36|0:51:46|That night at the dance party, the officers were each dancing with their partners, and their loved ones were by their side. The "喜" characters on the pastries constantly stirred up her longing and nostalgia for love.
0:51:46|0:52:2|Slightly tipsy, she embraced her lover's shoulders that night, swaying to the music. However, all of this turned into memories, fading away like bubbles. [Liu Yan] finished smashing the wedding cakes, then went to the window to wash her hands. The beautiful bracelet on her wrist gently swayed, looking quite charming.
0:52:5|0:52:30|Startled, [Liu Yan] looked up and saw that it was [Mu Liangfeng] holding a water kettle, which made her burst into laughter. Dressed in military uniform, [Mu Liangfeng] rode a bike with [Liu Yan] in a floral skirt. In the sunset, the two of them passed through a small alley and arrived in the fields. Along the narrow mountain road, various wildflowers bloomed on both sides. Sitting at the back of the bike, [Liu Yan] hugged [Mu Liangfeng]'s shoulder, happily swaying her head. Her beautiful curly hair shone in the light, making her even more charming and delightful. She was extremely happy.
0:52:30|0:52:38|Mu Liangfeng rode a bike. The two of them walk slowly on the small road in the mountains.
0:53:7|0:53:14|[Liu Yan] sat with her knees hugged, looking at the young man in front of her. Suddenly, she remembered something and gazed into the distance, saying:
0:53:26|0:53:54|[Liu Yan] didn't expect him to say that. She looked at him in surprise. [Mu Liangfeng] couldn't help but smile foolishly. He took out the homemade risk of rope and eggshells. The silly boy looked at her earnestly. He shook the wind chimes in his hand. [Liu Yan] reached out, her fingers gently plucking, a crisp sound rang out. She smiled as she took the wind chimes, held them close to her eyes to look at. It had been a long time since she had received a gift.
0:53:54|0:54:4|She held the wind chime high, letting it sway in front of her. She slowly closed her eyes as a gentle breeze rustled the leaves, while the two figures sat side by side on the hillside.
0:54:13|0:54:22|The platoon leader pressed against the neck of [Mu Liangfeng],
0:54:34|0:55:0|Xiao Mu gasped and shouted loudly: This voice attracted the attention of many soldiers. In the rainy night forest, Mu Liangfeng lay inside, holding a sniper rifle. He almost fell asleep absent-mindedly, with a blurry image of himself hunting pheasants in his mind. At that time, he only thought about bringing back more prey every day. On the other side, Liu Yan picked up the wind chimes from under the window and hung up the shell wind chime given to her by Mu Liangfeng.
0:55:0|0:55:10|On the rocks by the river, the snipers lay in position. Among them, [Mu Liangfeng] gazed steadfastly into the distance, stealing a glance at the platoon leader. Seizing the opportunity, he took out the letter given to him by [Liu Yan] from his pocket.
0:55:24|0:55:42|Illiterate [Mu Liangfeng] folded the letter and threw it into the cold river, which quickly washed it away. [Mu Liangfeng] picked up his gun again, staring into the distance without distraction. He remained motionless, his eyes particularly firm. The platoon leader looked at him with certainty as he gazed back, inside the Jingzhou granary.
0:55:48|0:56:10|Captain Zheng led the guards over, and the secret agent immediately saluted. Captain Zheng bent down to pick up the remaining photos from the iron bucket. As he slowly stood up and examined the photos, the atmosphere in the warehouse dropped to freezing point. Captain Zheng looked at his colleague in the photo and asked. The secret agent gave a negative answer. Enraged, Captain Zheng shot the secret agent dead. Another secret agent remained silent, later ordered to continue the search.
0:56:12|0:56:18|After receiving the order, [Mu Liangfeng] quickly escaped, and the impatient Lieutenant shot the warehouse owner dead with another shot.
0:56:18|0:56:34|The Japanese army quickly launched a comprehensive attack to the south, one by one major cities fell, and the number of refugees increased. Even those fleeing for their lives were not spared. As bombers flew overhead and bombs dropped, even the Nationalist Army on the front line found it difficult to resist. Failure and retreat were the main themes. Soldiers in the military camp were busy organizing intelligence and preparing for retreat.
0:57:2|0:57:32|Captain finished speaking and picked up the file bag to take the lead. On that day, inside the military truck sat [Mu Liangfeng], gritting his teeth, looking angry like a stubborn child. Xiao Wu comforted him, but [Mu Liangfeng] only half understood. The children were clamoring, and [Liu Yan] asked with concern about the worried [Er Wa].
0:57:40|0:57:58|The military vehicle carrying the sniper squad arrived, and as soon as [Mu Liangfeng] got off the car, he heard welcoming voices. [Liu Yan] ran to his side. [Liu Yan] quickly composed herself and said seriously:
0:58:18|0:58:41|The crowd walked towards the teahouse, with only [Mu Liangfeng] left behind, not favored by [Liu Yan]. As [Mu Liangfeng] gazed at the back of [Liu Yan], [Xiao Wen] happened to come over and said something to him before whimsically shaking his head and striding away. [Gui Ying] was using an electric grinder to polish bullet heads, slowly raising up the polished bullet and carefully examining it up close.
0:58:46|0:58:53|The guard untied the handkerchief, inside were pastries identical to those dropped by [Mu Liangfeng].
0:59:55|1:0:30|In the kitchen, [Liu Yan] was still busy cutting vegetables. [Mu Liangfeng] walked in with an empty wine jug. [Liu Yan] pointed in a direction and went to stir-fry the vegetables. [Mu Liangfeng] approached with a smile and said, [Liu Yan] dipped her hand in the cooked vegetables, touched [Mu Liangfeng]'s lips with her fingers, but [Mu Liangfeng] did not respond. [Liu Yan] asked persistently, then poured the vegetables into the trash can.
1:0:35|1:1:4|After saying that, Liu Yan went to cut vegetables. Mu Liangfeng walked up and held her shoulder, saying Mu Liangfeng opened his clothes, revealing the tattoo on his chest, which was a swallow facing the pillowcase. Liu Yan threw herself into his arms, then tightly hugged her beloved. The long-suppressed yearning in Liu Yan finally erupted, she hugged Mu Liangfeng's neck and kissed him.
1:1:4|1:1:17|[Mu Liangfeng] hesitated for a moment, then responded warmly. In the kitchen, the two embraced passionately. Besides the long-awaited reunion, there was also the love that had been brewing deep in their hearts. The beauty of the dance party once again climbed into [Liu Yan]'s heart.
1:1:17|1:1:35|[Mu Liangfeng] lay on her neck, kissing deeply, like a drowning person greedily breathing air. Outside the quiet teahouse, it started to rain again, while inside, the soldiers sat at the table checking their belongings together, and the platoon leader sat behind the pillar, staring at the roof.
1:1:35|1:2:2|He recalled that day on the battlefield, when he was just an ordinary soldier. The enemy sniper was skilled and had taken out several comrades. [Meng Zi], his brother, and the remaining comrades were hiding behind a broken wall, with [Meng Zi] pointing towards the smoke.
1:2:3|1:2:11|As soon as his younger brother put the cigarette in his mouth, [Meng Zi] also wanted to take a puff, so he said, "Brother, take the cigarette out of your mouth."
1:2:17|1:2:29|The younger brother lit a match and approached to light a cigarette for him, but was shot on the wall. The enemy sniper instantly killed the younger brother, splattering blood all over [Meng Zi]'s face, causing the blood on his face to drip down and extinguish the match.
1:2:29|1:2:38|In this scene, [Meng Zi] will never forget, in the teahouse [Meng Zi] lonelyly strikes a match and flicks it from his fingertips, repeating the action, striking it bright.
1:2:53|1:3:12|The platoon leader, Mu Liangfeng, never lit the cigarette he held in his mouth. He couldn't help but look out the window, recalling that afternoon when he played with his younger brother in the woods, messing up his hair time and time again. The match in his hand had already burned his fingers, but he finally snapped out of his reverie, flicked the match backwards, and took the cigarette out of his mouth.
1:3:12|1:3:26|Outside the teahouse, the support staff A Tian is setting off fireworks with the children. On the boat on the lake, [Liu Yan] is lying in the arms of [Mu Liangfeng], the sparkling lake water reflecting on their faces, creating an indescribable beauty.
1:4:6|1:4:26|[Mu Liangfeng] gently looked at [Liu Yan] in his arms, holding her hand tighter. [Liu Yan] looked up and said:
1:4:38|1:4:53|[Mu Liangfeng] frowned and looked at [Liu Yan], saying, "[Liu Yan] looked at [Mu Liangfeng] with a gentle and worried expression, reaching out to lightly touch [Mu Liangfeng]'s cheek. It was just a brief encounter, and tomorrow is dawn."
1:5:1|1:5:25|[Liu Yan], with beautiful eyes and a gentle gaze, under this setting, the two of them once again embrace and kiss each other. Their lips intertwine, expressing their love to each other. No one knows when they will meet again. Farewells are inevitable. As the night deepens, [Liu Yan]'s chamber is no longer lonely tonight. The soft light illuminates their faces as [Liu Yan], in a floral dress, lies on top of [Mu Liangfeng].
1:5:25|1:5:39|[Mu Liangfeng] gently embraced her slender waist, [Liu Yan] sucking on [Mu Liangfeng]'s lips. The two people occupied by love passionately expressed their emotions. [Mu Liangfeng] turned over, pressing down on [Liu Yan] like a fierce beast fiercely kissing [Liu Yan]. [Liu Yan] reached out and touched his lips.
1:5:43|1:5:58|[Mu Liangfeng] nodded, and the next moment, four lips lightly touched. The gaze of [Liu Yan] was blurred with desire for the man in front of her. She helped [Mu Liangfeng] take off his shirt, revealing his solid chest, with rugged lines highlighting his masculine charm.
1:5:58|1:6:21|Mu Liangfeng urgently unbuttoned the buttons on Liu Yan's neck, helped her remove her clothes, revealing the smooth and delicate undergarment inside. The two who had long fallen in love occupied each other's bodies on this night, love merging with emotions, evaporating through every pore on their bodies. Liu Yan, intoxicated, clung to the broad shoulders, feeling the surging and intense love. It is said that a moment of spring night is worth a thousand gold.
1:6:21|1:6:48|The morning light falls on the pillow, a gentle breeze blows, wind chimes ring, outside the teahouse on the military truck, the sniper team is waiting for [Mu Liangfeng] to return. The platoon leader is getting impatient, while Private Wu stares at the teahouse door and says: At this moment, [Mu Liangfeng] walks out with [Liu Yan]. As they approach the truck, [Liu Yan] looks up at [Mu Liangfeng] with endless tenderness and love in her eyes. [Mu Liangfeng] takes her hand and places it on his chest, then leans in to kiss [Liu Yan]'s forehead and says:
1:6:52|1:7:13|[Liu Yan] closed her eyes, nodded, and gently touched [Mu Liangfeng]'s cheek. She looked at his resolute face affectionately. Knowing the dangers ahead, [Mu Liangfeng] embraced [Liu Yan] and gave her a deep kiss. In this era of raging wars, love was precious. Then, lifting [Meng Zi], they both got on the truck and parted ways.
1:7:13|1:7:20|Mu Liangfeng glanced at the truck, Liu Yan nodded slightly. As they were about to leave, the two had to let go of their held hands. Mu Liangfeng walked over.
1:7:28|1:7:33|Mu Liangfeng, who got on the car, looked at the group of children and the eagerly waiting family members.
1:7:41|1:7:59|[Xiao Wen] loudly declares his love, as the military truck drives away into the distance. The others wave goodbye, leaving [Liu Yan] standing sadly at the teahouse entrance. The truck speeds across the bridge, knowing that this battle may end in either success or death. Inside the truck, the faces of the people are solemn, understanding that only with the determination to face death can they have a chance at rebirth.
1:7:59|1:8:25|Soon they set off, the atmosphere in the puppet army camp was lively. The sniper team rushed in with guns, kicking down the enemies. Meanwhile, in the Changde prisoner of war camp, under the flag of Japanese militarism, a line of officers drew their swords and took an oath. The camera captured this moment.
1:8:25|1:8:47|In the hospital, the young nurse was leaning against the window, her head down, with a look of sadness and melancholy. She knew that soon the ward would be filled with injured soldiers. Thinking of this, she couldn't bear it and walked out of the room. Holding a megaphone, she came to the stage and spoke the words she least wanted to say to the captives. Outside the barbed wire, Mu Liangfeng was also secretly watching.
1:8:56|1:9:24|A military jeep, with its lights on, slowly drives through the mountain road and stops in front of the Japanese prisoner of war camp. Japanese soldiers come forward to inspect, only to find that inside the car are disguised Nationalist soldiers. Sitting in the passenger seat, [Xiao Wen] presents a pass and greets "good evening." The Japanese soldier checks inside the car, sees nothing unusual, and signals for [Xiao Wen] to get out. As [Xiao Wen] steps out and walks away, the people inside the car can't help but watch the two figures leaving.
1:9:24|1:9:48|The Japanese soldiers conducting the inspection called over their companion to carefully examine the passes. [Xiao Wen] fluently dealt with them in Japanese, while another soldier quietly lifted the rear curtain of the military vehicle and inspected it one by one. Fortunately, the sniper team was well prepared, putting prisoner tags on their comrades and binding their hands. After confirming that there were no abnormalities, the inspecting Japanese soldiers finally left. At the same time, after the inspection was over, [Xiao Wen] returned to the military vehicle and reported that everything was fine. This time, it was a narrow escape.
1:9:48|1:10:5|The military vehicle slowly drove into the gate of the prisoner of war camp. Upon entering, what came into view was a temporary playground, with a large building standing in the north and another in the east. Japanese soldiers were still practicing on the playground, and a strong beam of light occasionally swept across from the watchtower. The platoon leader was driving the military vehicle attentively, but unexpectedly brushed shoulders with Lieutenant Zhengye's car when making a turn.
1:10:5|1:10:31|Fortunately, there were no flaws exposed, everything was proceeding according to the previous plan. On the cliff outside the prisoner of war camp, among the dense grass under the moonlight, a half of a face could be vaguely seen. It was Xiao Bin, who was providing cover outside. He was aiming at Meng Zi's military vehicle through the scope. The car slowly stopped, and comrades got off one after another. The comrades disguised as prisoners were escorted, carrying packages containing bombs. The group headed towards the building, while the sound of singing came from the radio.
1:10:31|1:10:46|Soldiers in the corridor leisurely trimming the flowers and plants, the sniper team passing by, the record player inside spinning. Everyone in the corridor is pressing the former pseudo army to turn into another path, which is the power supply place to be attacked.
1:10:46|1:10:54|The group walked quickly forward, A Tian and [A Gui] exchanged a glance, opened the door together, the sound of the electric turbine kept going, Sergeant [Meng Zi] held a gun and walked forward.
1:10:58|1:11:11|The Japanese soldiers who hadn't reacted yet were taken out by [Meng Zi], the soldiers pretending to be captured untied the ropes, took out the prepared explosives, and the Japanese soldiers on the training ground started shooting the prisoners with pistols. A Tian found the fuse, while the Japanese soldiers pushed the prisoners.
1:11:11|1:11:23|Atian set up the detonator, and the Japanese soldiers lined up for the execution. The sound of gunfire frightened the young nurse in the room, and at this moment, [Meng Zi] stepped out. The puppet army pointed in a direction and began to lead the way.
1:11:23|1:11:47|The bomb at the power supply station has started counting down. In the intelligence room, the Japanese army is receiving a telegram, obviously unaware of the late-night visit of the sniper team. The telegraph operator receives urgent information, his face immediately darkens, and at the same time, the sniper team led by the pseudo army successfully arrives at the intelligence room. Passing by, the people downstairs see a Japanese soldier reporting to the commander. Upstairs, Mu Liangfeng's face changes when he hears it. He quickly walks up and pats Xiao Wen on the back.
1:11:48|1:12:18|Xiao Wu looked down towards the building, the Japanese intelligence officer finished reporting and ran towards the second floor. Just as he was going up the stairs, he was controlled from behind by [Mu Liangfeng]. Xiao Wu went forward to help, and the two dragged him into the room. Inside the room, [Mu Liangfeng] anxiously asked Xiao Wu what the officer had just said downstairs. Seeing no reaction from the Japanese, [Mu Liangfeng] threw a punch, while Xiao Wu pulled out his gun, released the safety, and pointed it at the officer's head. The intelligence officer immediately softened and said:
1:12:38|1:12:49|He punched the platoon leader in the face, pulled out a gun and said, "The Japanese soldiers outside the door, looking through the gap opened by [Mu Liangfeng], realized something was wrong and went to report the news."
1:13:9|1:13:22|[Mu Liangfeng] pointed the gun at his own head, and the platoon leader saw the Japanese soldiers approaching through a crack, shouting loudly: "Everyone, attack!"
1:13:23|1:13:49|A Japanese soldier stumbled into the broadcasting room, shouting that there were enemies infiltrating. Both soldiers and officers immediately responded to the call. The officer commanded the trained Japanese soldiers to rush towards the building with their guns. A sniper shot rang out, causing a Japanese soldier to fall to the ground. Another shot led to chaos among the Japanese soldiers, who immediately searched for Xiaobin's position. The bright searchlight shone, and Xiaobin, caught off guard, died in the crossfire.
1:13:49|1:14:10|Two more Japanese soldiers rushed up the building, [Mu Liangfeng] raised his hand and shot them dead with two shots. The platoon leader also shot dead the soldier behind the window and shouted, "[Mu Liangfeng] rushed out and picked up the enemy's submachine gun. He threw it with both hands, and the platoon leader caught it steadily. With intense gunfire, the incoming Japanese soldiers were like lambs to the slaughter. He then turned around and charged towards the main entrance downstairs, firing at the Japanese soldiers who rushed in.
1:14:10|1:14:31|The machine gun, like the scythe of death, was reaping the lives of the Japanese soldiers. With a lucky empty magazine, more Japanese soldiers rushed in. The [Platoon Leader] shouted loudly, while [Private Wu] held off the suppressive fire, buying time for the [Platoon Leader] to reload. As they fought and retreated, the [Platoon Leader] at the rear took the opportunity to shoot outside through the railing. Soon they turned the corner of the corridor, but the [Platoon Leader] at the rear was already hit. [A Gui] supported the [Platoon Leader] and retreated into the room.
1:14:40|1:15:0|[Xiao Wen] dragged the nurse into the room, the record player in the broadcasting room was stuck. The group of people inside the room, who had prepared their equipment, confronted the Japanese soldiers while holding the nurse hostage. The Japanese officer ordered a full retreat, as [Sergeant] calculated the time of the explosion. The group forced the Japanese soldiers to retreat while holding the nurse, and the Japanese soldiers did not dare to take any risks until they went downstairs.
1:15:0|1:15:17|Mu Liangfeng took the lead in pulling down the flag of Japanese militarism, and when the lookout tower shone its searchlight, Mu Liangfeng shot it down with one bullet. He reloaded, and the snipers of the squad huddled closely together, facing off against dozens of Japanese soldiers below the steps. The commanding officer leading the Japanese soldiers panicked first and shouted:
1:15:17|1:15:44|The sniper team dared not be careless, tightly gripping their guns and aiming ahead. The Japanese soldiers in formation were unwilling to retreat, raising their guns to aim at the group. [Mu Liangfeng], the platoon leader, said firmly, while [A Gui] reported the time promptly. Then, he slowly approached the jeep with his submachine gun. As [A Gui] climbed into the car, the Japanese commander said fiercely:
1:15:45|1:15:52|[Sergeant] raised his hand and shot the officer dead, causing the young nurse to scream in fright.
1:15:58|1:16:34|On the second floor, two snipers with guns were looking for opportunities, as the time for the explosion drew closer. The Japanese soldiers were completely unaware. [Mu Liangfeng] had to open fire to suppress the enemy from advancing. As the bomb was about to explode, the snipers upstairs still seized the opportunity. [Mu Liangfeng] shielded [A Tian] from being shot, and [A Tian] pushed [Mu Liangfeng] into the car. [A Tian], who was guarding the rear, was shot again.
1:16:34|1:16:42|The off-road vehicle rushed out at this moment, surrounded by the enemy. The sniper still tried to find an opportunity. Each Japanese soldier chased forward. [Platoon Leader] took out a grenade, pulled the pin, and threw it out with all his might.
1:16:44|1:16:49|The explosion knocked down many Japanese soldiers, and the off-road vehicle took the opportunity to leave in a cloud of dust, disappearing into the night.
1:16:58|1:17:17|Mu Liangfeng didn't expect Meng Zi to say such serious words. The platoon leader who moved his body accidentally touched the wound, causing unbearable pain. Mu Liangfeng hurried forward to check anxiously. Just as the nurse was about to approach, the platoon leader angrily said, "And at this moment, A Gui, who was driving, slowly released his hand covering his stomach, and upon closer inspection, it was covered in blood."
1:17:17|1:17:25|The co-pilot Xiao Wen looked at him anxiously and took out a bandage to help him press the wound, but the situation did not improve.
1:17:58|1:18:2|He recalled that night at Fengling Ferry, where beautiful fireworks bloomed in the night sky, it was so beautiful.
1:18:4|1:18:17|Saying these words, he seemed to have exhausted his last bit of strength, staring blankly into the distance. The fireworks in his memories also gradually lost their colors, and his life came to an end. He fell at that moment, and the car instantly lost control.
1:18:19|1:18:38|In the back seat, [Mu Liangfeng] leaned forward to control the steering wheel with Xiao Wen, while the platoon leader lost consciousness in the shaking. The medic took over Meng Zi's injuries, and the alarm sounded in the prisoner camp. The soldiers anxiously said, "The other car is swaying on the road." Inside the car, Xiao Wen struggled to hold onto the steering wheel.
1:18:38|1:18:44|The car broke down at this moment, causing panic among the group and plunging them into a desperate situation. Meanwhile,
1:18:44|1:19:4|[Liu Yan] is tidying up her clothes and accessories. She picks up a floral long skirt and can't help but pause, wondering where her beloved [Mu Liangfeng] is. Unbeknownst to the busy [Liu Yan], she has already been targeted by the lurking Captain Masayoshi, who is aiming a dark gun barrel from across the street. Through the scope, the person being aimed at is none other than [Mu Liangfeng], and the wind chime he made gently sways in the breeze.
1:19:4|1:19:11|Zhenye seemed to be waiting for something, when [Liu Yan] turned and walked into the inner room, suddenly a burst of firecrackers broke the quiet night.
1:19:11|1:19:37|On the second floor, Mu Liangfeng looked over and saw a newlywed couple walking hand in hand across the bridge, followed by family and friends. Mu Liangfeng stared at them coldly, but the lively and festive atmosphere infected him. In that moment, his heart was touched, and he imagined that the people on the bridge were himself and Nurse Bin Tian. Dressed in formal attire, he gazed affectionately at the white wedding dress-wearing Bin Tian. However, he knew it was only a fantasy, and he closed his eyes in pain, refusing to think about it anymore.
1:19:38|1:19:52|When he opened his eyes, the streets of the town were filled with fleeing people. He approached the scope and looked through it, seeing [Liu Yan] in the teahouse talking to [Er Wa].
1:20:0|1:20:6|[Liu Yan] persuaded the mother and daughter who were taken in to leave. After saying that, [Liu Yan] walked towards the second floor.
1:20:14|1:20:42|In a desperate attempt to save someone, [Mu Liangfeng] turned and ran towards the direction of the small town. In the teahouse, on the second floor, [Liu Yan] walked towards the desk, opened a drawer and took out some cash. Just as she turned around, she was startled by the man in front of her, who turned out to be Zhengye, revealing a sinister smile. A sense of foreboding filled the air as the sound of wind chimes rang out ominously. Meanwhile, on the small road, [Mu Liangfeng] ran for his life.
1:20:44|1:20:58|Through the fleeing crowd, with the town still far away, [Mu Liangfeng] was anxious. A group of people on horseback blocked his way.
1:21:17|1:21:36|The platoon leader in the carriage woke up sweating profusely, only to find that it was the nurse who had saved him, but [Mu Liangfeng] was nowhere to be seen. At that moment, on the small bridge of Fengling Ferry, [Mu Liangfeng] ran against the crowd and quickly arrived at the teahouse.
1:21:44|1:22:8|[Mu Liangfeng] looked around the furnishings on the second floor at this moment, finding everything neatly arranged. He noticed that the clothes on the table were only half tidied up, the photo in front of the desk lamp was still there, and there was a pastry next to it. [Mu Liangfeng] quickly walked over, picked up the pastry with the imprint of [Liu Yan] Teahouse, and a sense of foreboding rose in his heart. With a gentle breeze blowing, the curtains swayed, and [Mu Liangfeng] looked out the window vigilantly.
1:22:8|1:22:40|At that moment, a bullet pierced through his palm. He lay on the ground, struggling to move, then kicked over the table to block the window. As the car drove into Fengling Ferry, Xiao Wu pulled the bolt of the gun and jumped out of the car, while [Mu Liangfeng] leaned against the wall, wrapping his palm with gauze. He pulled out the handgun John gave him, holding his head and crouching as he passed through the second floor.
1:22:42|1:23:7|The sound of gunshots rang out, and the bullets seemed like the death warrants of the King of Hell. [Mu Liangfeng] accidentally stepped into the void and fell from the second floor. His pistol dropped in a corner. As he was trying to get up, Xiao Wen rushed over. Xiao Wen tried to help him up, but was pulled down by him. Xiao Wen, realizing the danger, slowly moved aside. The glass was shattered by a shot, another bullet pierced through the wooden door, grazing Xiao Wen's scalp as it flew past.
1:23:8|1:23:31|Mu Liangfeng found Liu Yan's clothes outside the door and ran towards the house. Xiao Wen got up to chase after him. Mu Liangfeng outside the house became a living target. At this moment, Xiao Wen also stepped forward. While Xiao Wen was shooting back with a pistol, he quickly ran to Mu Liangfeng's side. The two of them hid under the steps. At this time, the Japanese sniper team walked down from the bridge and saw this scene. They put down their guns and went to support them.
1:23:31|1:23:41|Upon hearing the whistle, the Japanese soldiers ran towards Zheng Ye. [Mu Liangfeng] struggled to get up and looked towards the opposite second floor, but found no enemies. The Japanese soldiers on this side reported back.
1:23:44|1:24:9|Mu Liangfeng saw Liu Yan's clothes scattered on the ground one by one. He quickly got up and Xiao Wen followed. Mu Liangfeng held the gun and followed the route of the discarded clothes, with Xiao Wen keeping up. The two remained vigilant around them. Just as they crossed the bridge, gunshots rang out. They hurried to find cover, and at that moment, bombers tore through the night sky. Three bombers flew towards the direction of the small town.
1:24:9|1:24:13|The bombers flew in perfect formation, showcasing exceptional piloting skills.
1:24:13|1:24:39|[Mu Liangfeng] hid behind the wall, looking towards the other end of the alley. The alley was quiet, and a small cart slowly emerged. Bound on the cart were the mother and child who should have been fleeing, but unexpectedly they appeared here. Suddenly, a gunshot rang out, the mother fell, and the child cried out for her. In the corner, [Mu Liangfeng] was burning with anger. Meanwhile, Xiao Wu looked outside through the gap in the bamboo shed, waiting for an opportunity. At that moment, another cart was pushed out.
1:24:48|1:24:53|Just as Xiao Wu was about to rush out to rescue someone, he was forced back by bullets, and he struggled to look towards [Mu Liangfeng].
1:24:54|1:25:7|At the entrance of the alley, Zhengye's attendant walked out with a gun against [Liu Yan]'s head. Zhengye aimed his gun at [Er Wa]. Unable to bear it any longer, [Mu Liangfeng] stepped out, pointing a gun at Zhengye. His injured right hand couldn't help but tremble.
1:25:12|1:25:18|[Mu Liangfeng] recalled the first time he carried out a mission, sitting in the military vehicle and looking at Zheng Ye.
1:25:37|1:25:53|Mu Liangfeng told Lieutenant Colonel lightly that Miss Hamada had been kidnapped. The Lieutenant Colonel was first surprised, then his eyes widened in anger. He shouted angrily towards the other end of the alley. Lightly pushed Liu Yan, Mu Liangfeng did as he said and shot towards Er Wa.
1:25:59|1:26:13|At this moment, the platoon leader caught up, intending to abduct Miss Hamada. Lieutenant Shao glared fiercely, while Mu Liangfeng's situation was also not optimistic, blood seeping through the gauze, dripping down.
1:26:15|1:26:37|Walking forward with [Liu Yan], who was extremely nervous, she breathed out slightly, moving forward cautiously as if walking on thin ice. The platoon leader slowly released Miss Bitian and pointed the gun at the back of her head, instructing her to move forward slowly. Meanwhile, [Mu Liangfeng], who was holding the gun, had sweat dripping down his chin, not daring to relax his vigilance. The platoon leader seemed to see an opportunity in his heart, but [Mu Liangfeng] was unaware that he was already deeply in danger.
1:26:37|1:26:59|A sniper on the high wall has locked onto his head, while the platoon leader in the alley has been pointing a gun at Bin Tian's head. The two of them walked towards the direction of the lieutenant together, but another sniper rifle has also locked onto the platoon leader. The platoon leader stopped in his tracks, just reaching the middle of the alley. As they passed each other, in the shadows, the sniper's target switched to [Liu Yan].
1:26:59|1:27:12|The two hostages walked in their respective directions, the atmosphere becoming extremely tense. Miss Hamada looked at the unfamiliar Captain Masaki, who slowly lowered his gun and called out Hamada's name. At this moment, a strange sound seemed to come from the air.
1:27:12|1:27:44|First Miss Hamada, then [Mu Liangfeng], followed by everyone looking up involuntarily. Even the sniper on the building noticed. The bombers are coming. Three bombers are flying towards the town. [Mu Liangfeng] rushes out, embraces [Liu Yan], and retreats. The awakened Lieutenant immediately starts shooting. Xiao Wu throws himself out to block the bullets. Xiao Wu falls to the ground with a sound. The bombers start to dive, and the bombs falling on the street destroy everything.
1:27:44|1:27:57|The impact also knocked down Mu Liangfeng. At this moment, a bomb fell from the sky, the rotating bomb shattered the roof but did not explode, instead getting stuck on the roof. Fenglingdu Town was thus engulfed in smoke and chaos under the bombardment of the Japanese army.
1:27:57|1:28:9|In the small town, the pond and the arched bridge were all indiscriminately bombed, including the sniper on the roof who didn't have time to retreat, rolling down from the eaves one by one.
1:28:13|1:28:30|The bomb was like a sharp chisel, chiseling the calm wind chimes into a state of disrepair, everything being annihilated in the fiery explosion. [Liu Yan]'s teahouse was no exception, the string of bullet shell wind chimes swaying in the fire, as if singing the final elegy, and Xiao Wu, who was hit, couldn't withstand the baptism of gunfire.
1:28:54|1:29:22|Even at the end of his life, Xiao Wu still dreams of the ideal of teaching and literacy. The lieutenant, who crawled out of the fire, called out the name of his beloved. Covered in soot and tattered clothes, he picked up his gun from the ground. His love for Bintian supported his actions. He stumbled through the chaotic alley, shouting and searching, with only the raging fire and crackling sounds accompanying him.
1:29:23|1:29:32|The wailing child startled Captain Mu Liangfeng, who aimed his gun and shouted angrily, but ultimately spared the child.
1:29:33|1:29:40|The flames of war have left too many scars in this small town, as well as too many traumas in people's hearts.
1:29:40|1:30:3|[Mu Liangfeng] also lay motionless on the ground, while on the side, [Liu Yan] was also lying on the ground. The overturned cart's wheels creaked as if telling a tale of misfortune with a hoarse voice. [Liu Yan] slowly opened her eyes, and after a while, she regained consciousness. She gasped and tried to get up, but she found that the fallen cart was firmly pressing down on her legs.
1:30:3|1:30:11|She reached out to push, but couldn't move an inch. She looked around anxiously and found Mu Liangfeng lying unconscious.
1:30:15|1:30:21|[Mu Liangfeng] suddenly woke up, sat up, his eyes pitch black, briefly losing his vision.
1:30:39|1:30:50|[Liu Yan] grabbed [Mu Liangfeng]'s hand and felt the wheel, the two of them overturned it together. [Mu Liangfeng] lay down, [Liu Yan] struggled to climb up, and Shao Zuo still refused to give up.
1:31:3|1:31:14|Major Mengzi threw the sniper rifle aside and urgently called out. He helped Miss Bin Tian up from the ground, gently held her in his arms and shook her. With blood all over her face, she opened her eyes and answered with difficulty:
1:31:45|1:31:55|At that moment, Bin Tian lost all signs of life, it was already too late. Shao Zuo held her hand and froze, his beloved woman finally fell in his arms.
1:31:59|1:32:11|After saying that, [Mu Liangfeng] tightly embraced her, repeating that sentence. The stern and fierce lieutenant slowly lifted his head at this moment, his eyes moist with tears. He looked up at the sky and opened his mouth.
1:32:11|1:32:30|In this moment, his inner world finally collapsed. Overwhelmed with grief, he let out a long howl to the sky. In his heart, he secretly vowed to take revenge on [Mu Liangfeng]. His lips no longer trembled, his eyes became fierce and sharp. He gritted his teeth fiercely, swearing to seek vengeance.
1:32:30|1:32:50|At the same time, the platoon leader who had regained consciousness pushed open the small car. He struggled to get up, his mind still not clear. The Japanese jeep had already started. He raised his hand and shot the driver twice, causing the jeep to head towards him. The platoon leader jumped onto the jeep, punched the Japanese soldier in the face, dragged him out of the car, and threw him to the ground, landing a heavy blow on his face.
1:32:51|1:33:9|The Japanese soldier who was about to counterattack was thrown away with his neck clamped by his legs. Through the fence, the platoon leader tightly strangled his neck with the Japanese soldier's clothes. The suffocating Japanese soldier struggled with all his strength, kicking his feet on the ground until he completely stopped breathing. The platoon leader was also exhausted.
1:33:11|1:33:26|Lying on the ground, panting heavily, while on the other side, [Mu Liangfeng] carrying [Liu Yan], with [Liu Yan] acting as [Mu Liangfeng]'s eyes. [Mu Liangfeng] suddenly stopped when he heard a noise, and he looked back.
1:33:29|1:33:36|The two of them sneaked into a household, [Mu Liangfeng] loaded the bullet and handed the gun to [Liu Yan].
1:33:37|1:34:8|The footsteps of the Japanese army are getting closer, [Liu Yan] has no choice but to take the pistol. [Mu Liangfeng] instructs her, "The Japanese army is getting closer." [Liu Yan] nods in agreement. [Mu Liangfeng] advises, "Hold the gun tightly with both hands." Outside, the Japanese soldiers slowly raise their sniper rifles and shoot, hitting two shots and falling backwards.
1:34:10|1:34:21|[Mu Liangfeng] urged [Liu Yan] to run quickly. The brief sound of gunfire just now was enough to attract more surviving Japanese soldiers. However, after running only a few steps, [Mu Liangfeng] was already locked in by a sniper scope.
1:34:21|1:34:30|It was Mu Liangfeng on the other side of the river, he was not in a hurry to take the lives of the two, so he turned the gun and broke the swaying electric pole.
1:34:38|1:34:54|The utility pole pulled down other lines, causing all the tiles to collapse and the roof to cave in. [Mu Liangfeng] was smashed into the water as a result. [Liu Yan] had her legs trapped under a pile of broken wood and tiles. She tried to move but to no avail, once again losing her ability to move. Suddenly, she realized that [Mu Liangfeng] had disappeared.
1:35:4|1:35:15|Facing the insane lieutenant, [Liu Yan] was very timid. In the small river, [Mu Liangfeng] peeked out, holding a gun and lying down. He aimed at the lieutenant and pulled the trigger, only to find that the bullets had run out.
1:35:15|1:35:29|However, at this moment, he noticed a non-exploded bomb wedged in the house behind the major, but he had no bullets to detonate it. The major suddenly changed targets, aiming at [Liu Yan]. [Liu Yan] panicked, and the major, with a fierce expression, said:
1:36:0|1:36:38|The child handed a bullet to [Mu Liangfeng], which was the one that he accidentally dropped under the bed on his first night at the teahouse. It was picked up by this curious child and in the explosion, the house shattered, wood splinters flew in all directions, time seemed to slow down at that moment. [Liu Yan] breathed a sigh of relief, and [Mu Liangfeng] also exhausted all his strength, slowly falling down.
1:36:38|1:36:55|Liu Yan looked over, Mu Liangfeng insisted on turning his head to look at her, faint shouts came, Mu Liangfeng, with blurred vision, raised his gun, still wanting to protect Liu Yan. It was the platoon leader and the guerrilla team coming, and he fell down exhausted.
1:36:56|1:37:29|In Fenglingdu Town, this town that has been baptized by artillery no longer has its former appearance. At the graveside, [Liu Yan] steps forward to place a bouquet of flowers. The guerrilla team, with [Mu Liangfeng] and the platoon leader in mourning, stands solemnly as the platoon leader gives a command. The sound of airplanes is heard, and everyone looks up to see two planes flying in the distance. The guerrilla team leader pulls out his gun, ready for battle.
1:37:40|1:37:51|The plane did not drop bombs, but scattered newspapers like celestial flowers. [Mu Liangfeng] reached out and caught one, taking a closer look. On it was a photo of him and [Liu Yan], with the headline: "My Chinese Friends".
