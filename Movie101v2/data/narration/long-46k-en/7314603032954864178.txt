0:0:51|0:0:55|On a rainy day, [Ke Jianming] is being criticized by the boss.
0:2:8|0:2:23|The boss watched as [Ke Jianming] walked away and asked the secretary. The secretary nodded innocently, and [Ke Jianming], upon learning that his wife was dying, rushed home in a state of anxiety. Unfortunately, the weather did not cooperate as it started to rain heavily outside.
0:2:23|0:2:28|Watching the pedestrians with umbrellas on the road, he stomped his feet in anxiety and turned to the security guard for help.
0:2:40|0:2:58|[Ke Jianming] could only grit his teeth and rush into the rain alone, the pouring rain causing the streets to be flooded everywhere. He used his arms to shield himself from the rain and dodged puddles as he ran towards home, finally making it to the entrance of the residential area. A speeding car splashed him with water again, making his already makeshift suit even worse off.
0:2:58|0:3:5|Wife [Wang Yue] is sitting in front of the dressing table at the moment, concentrating on applying makeup, dabbing lipstick on her lips to create full lips.
0:3:6|0:3:13|Open your eyes wide and use mascara to brush your eyelashes thick and long. At this moment, [Ke Jianming] ran back to the apartment in the pouring rain.
0:3:19|0:3:29|He didn't have time to answer, casually said a few words, and then hurriedly ran towards the elevator. After pressing for a while, the elevator did not respond. Upon closer inspection, the sign on the elevator door read:
0:3:33|0:3:42|He rolled his eyes in resignation, ran towards the stairwell, and started climbing the stairs. He gripped the handrail tightly and took big steps upwards. Before long, he sighed in exhaustion:
0:3:46|0:3:52|To save his wife, he had to grit his teeth and persevere. By the time he reached the floor, he was already exhausted and powerless.
0:3:56|0:4:1|He walked to the door gasping for breath, urgently knocking on the door and shouting loudly inside.
0:7:0|0:7:7|[Wang Yue] watched as [Ke Jianming] walked away, gradually calming down. She glanced at her watch and said disappointedly.
0:7:18|0:7:35|[Wang Yue] muttered to herself and closed the door. That night, [Zhao Kexin] and her husband [Yu Bin] were sleeping soundly when a phone call came in. [Yu Bin] groggily answered the phone. The crying on the other end puzzled her, and [Zhao Kexin] asked her about it.
0:9:21|0:9:37|Please don't hesitate to like, subscribe, share, and support the Mingjing and Diandian programs.
0:10:27|0:10:35|[Ke Jianming] returned to the company after leaving home. He sat in a chair, looking at the newspaper with fatigue. The secretary, beautiful, came in with coffee and knocked on the door, warmly saying to him.
0:10:53|0:11:11|Ke Jianming didn't think much and casually replied, [Zhao Kexin] placed the coffee on the table, took off her hairpin, let down her hair, slightly shook her head, making her hair look more lazy and charming. She gazed at Ke Jianming with a hint of ambiguity, then unbuttoned her coat and slowly took it off, while her left hand caressed her right shoulder.
0:11:11|0:11:20|Pulling down the collar, revealing the shoulder, pouting the lips, and looking at the other party with a bewildered expression. Ke Jianming, seeing this, widened his eyes and quickly stopped her in surprise.
0:12:10|0:12:23|Ke Jianming saw Zhao Kexin's sinister intentions, quickly dodged, and seized the opportunity to start running away. The two circled around the office desk, chasing each other, with various situations arising. In the end, Ke Jianming was still pressed down on the sofa by Zhao Kexin.
0:12:23|0:12:30|[Zhao Kexin] passionately embraces Ke Jianming and starts kissing him. Despite Ke Jianming's struggles, he eventually succumbs to the tender embrace.
0:13:6|0:13:11|[Zhao Kexin] took the script and grabbed her bag, then walked towards the director.
0:13:27|0:13:30|Several models stepped onto the stage and began their showcase one by one.
0:13:54|0:14:12|Filming officially begins, [Yu Bin] is discussing shooting matters with his assistant. Unbeknownst to him, [Helen] is watching him attentively. As [Helen] watches [Yu Bin] working diligently, a smug smile appears on her face. She sets down her coffee and elegantly walks over to [Yu Bin].
0:14:12|0:14:18|He stood quietly next to [Yu Bin], and then he bent down at the right moment, whispering gently in [Yu Bin]'s ear.
0:14:40|0:14:53|[Wang Yue] hinted that she had arrived at the agreed location with [Zhao Kexin]. With a low ponytail, wearing a bulky cotton coat, and carrying an old-fashioned handbag, [Wang Yue] arrived at the agreed meeting place with [Zhao Kexin], "You must be Miss Zhao, right?"
0:15:26|0:15:40|Seeing the sloppy appearance of [Wang Yue], [Zhao Kexin] couldn't help but say. [Wang Yue] looked bewildered and awkwardly adjusted her glasses.
0:18:12|0:18:22|Later, [Zhao Kexin] took [Wang Yue] to the gym to lose weight. She watched as [Wang Yue], with a determined look in her eyes, sweating profusely on the treadmill, and then voiced her inner doubts.
0:19:43|0:19:50|Encouraged by [Zhao Kexin], [Wang Yue] felt extremely confident and climbed rapidly on the treadmill, only to fall down the next second.
0:19:50|0:20:5|The intense training by Gao Qiang left [Wang Yue] exhausted. She dragged her sore legs towards the sofa, carefully climbed up and lay down with difficulty. The pain in her body made her unable to help but complain.
0:20:9|0:20:21|He gently tapped his thigh, the intense pain making him cry out in agony. He reached out his arm and picked up the phone on the coffee table.
0:20:37|0:20:41|[Ke Jianming] listened to the snoring on the phone, feeling increasingly uneasy.
0:21:36|0:21:40|[Ke Jianming] listened to the beautiful words and couldn't help but be enchanted, reaching out to hold her hand.
0:22:17|0:22:27|At this moment, [Zhao Kexin] is leisurely watching TV at home. She takes out a cucumber from the vegetable salad in her arms and starts eating it. After chewing for a few moments, she finds it bland and begins to complain.
0:22:31|0:22:42|He turned around and picked up the phone on the table, happily calling [Yu Bin]. Hearing the phone ringing while eating hotpot, [Yu Bin] quickly picked up the phone on the table to answer the call.
0:22:56|0:23:0|[Zhao Kexin] hung up the phone contentedly, and [Yu Bin] stood up to explain to everyone.
0:23:20|0:23:25|Helen reluctantly bid farewell to [Yu Bin], watching his departing figure, then turned to the others and asked.
0:23:49|0:24:11|Early the next morning, [Wang Yue] woke up from the bed, reaching out to the pillow out of habit, only to find it empty. She immediately sat up, checking the situation. She lifted the blanket and got out of bed, walking to the living room to look around.
0:24:21|0:24:26|[Wang Yue] angrily walked back to the bedroom, looking at the wedding photo on the wall, and said.
0:25:28|0:25:41|[Wang Yue] opened the door and saw [Zhao Kexin], dressed in a low-cut top, arrogantly walking into her house. She intentionally lowered her neckline, showing off her well-maintained figure, and provocatively locked eyes with her. [Wang Yue] asked in confusion.
0:26:18|0:26:50|You are shameless, get out of my sight! Ke Jianming, you are despicable. You are not a human being, bringing this woman to bully me. I don't want to live anymore, I don't want to live anymore. [Wang Yue] is holding her injured arm, feeling heartbroken by the betrayal. Meanwhile, Meili is choosing a bracelet with Ke Jianming in the store.
0:27:5|0:27:18|Ke Jianming smiled awkwardly when he heard this, but what Wang Yue was thinking in her beautiful heart was that the next morning, she arrived at the park for a run. The auntie next to her saw this and said to her husband.
0:27:24|0:27:43|The elderly couple watched [Wang Yue] running with great concern. [Wang Yue] was dressed in sportswear, running in the park with a flushed face and heavy breathing. The high-intensity exercise made her feel exhausted. As she ran on the grass, her steps gradually became unsteady, and her body involuntarily fell down straight to the ground.
0:27:43|0:27:47|She picked up the glasses dropped on the grass and put them on herself.
0:28:1|0:28:20|She lay on the grass, a figure of pain. The bright sunlight spilled onto the spacious soccer field, where a group of young handsome men and beautiful women were dancing street dance. They formed a circle, swaying to the beat of the music. A middle-aged woman in a bright top and a scarf was also standing among them, happily moving her body.
0:28:20|0:28:23|Young men are showcasing their own impressive dance moves.
0:28:24|0:28:39|They danced to the rhythm of the music, with the beautiful girls joining in and swaying their bodies along with the music. Auntie was also happily dancing, but her dance was interrupted by a phone ringing.
0:29:9|0:29:21|[Zhao Kexin] picked up a magazine to cover her face, secretly observing Cao Lan who was getting styled. The stylist Jing Zhuang also introduced her to the dancing auntie who had arrived at the hair salon, getting her hair done while watching Cao Lan.
0:29:44|0:30:1|After finishing her hair, Cao Lan was about to leave. As she turned around, she caught [Zhao Kexin] peeking at her. Startled, [Zhao Kexin] quickly picked up a magazine to cover her face. Cao Lan picked up her bag and left, a smile appearing on her face.
0:30:1|0:30:7|Cao Lan glanced at Dong Niang, who was doing her hair, ignored her, and walked straight to the cashier to settle the bill.
0:30:13|0:30:18|[Zhao Kexin] looked at the mirror as Cao Lan had already left, touching her face with both hands in contemplation.
0:30:23|0:30:26|Mother-in-law looked stunned as her daughter-in-law Cao Lan had already left.
0:30:34|0:30:48|Mother-in-law followed Cao Lan to the clothing store. She saw [Cao Lan] busy paying at the cashier, quietly sneaked into the store and hid in the clothes. She watched [Cao Lan] worryingly as she picked out a pile of clothes and glanced at the prices.
0:30:51|0:31:7|After Cao Lan finished paying, the waiter delivered the items to the door, and she left contentedly. The mother-in-law hid behind the clothes, observing the whole time, sneering at her actions, then quickly grabbed her own bag and followed. Ignoring the strange looks from the store staff, she walked quickly to the door, but did not find any trace of Cao Lan.
0:31:7|0:31:12|She stood at the doorway, looking blankly at the empty street. The atmosphere suddenly became tense.
0:31:20|0:31:26|At the award ceremony for the Best Advertisement Film at the 9th Guangdong Advertising Creative Awards.
0:32:23|0:32:36|Tao Lan returned to her empty bedroom, exhaustedly collapsing on the bed. The familiar ringtone of her phone sounded beside her. She sat up, picked up the phone, glanced at the caller ID, and answered the call.
0:33:22|0:33:35|At night, [Ke Jianming] finished a day's work and returned home. After a simple wash, he went to the bedroom to prepare for sleep. At this time, [Wang Yue] was sound asleep in bed, with a pair of long legs exposed outside, arousing [Ke Jianming]'s interest.
0:33:35|0:33:47|He lay on the bed, looking at the smooth skin of [Wang Yue]'s legs, swallowing saliva, eagerly lying beside [Wang Yue] and holding her in his arms. Unexpectedly, [Wang Yue] turned over and left his embrace, she continued to lean against him with lingering feelings.
0:33:48|0:34:5|[Wang Yue] pushed him away again, looking impatient, [Ke Jianming] watched his wife's indifferent attitude with suspicion, then turned and left. Sensing something wrong, [Wang Yue] woke up groggily, looked at the empty bed, rubbed his eyes and got up to check the situation.
0:35:23|0:35:33|[Ke Jianming] left without a word, completely disregarding [Wang Yue]'s feelings. The more [Wang Yue] thought about it, the more she couldn't help but burst into tears. She immediately called [Zhao Kexin] to pour out her heart.
0:36:0|0:36:5|[Wang Yue] threw away the phone and burst into tears. Hearing her cry, [Zhao Kexin] became worried and quickly comforted her.
0:36:54|0:37:12|[Wang Yue] tightly grabbed her own neck with both hands, the strong sense of suffocation causing her to roll her eyes uncontrollably. She slowly released her hands, adjusting her breathing. With a sudden inspiration, she changed her target, rushed to the kitchen, took out a kitchen knife, and walked out, rolling up her sleeves to reveal her smooth wrists.
0:37:14|0:37:35|Closing her eyes, [Zhao Kexin] raised the kitchen knife in her hand, hesitated for a moment, but still couldn't bring herself to strike. With tears in her eyes, she looked at the knife in her hand, then glanced at her wrist. Silently, she turned the knife around and lightly tapped her wrist with the back of the blade. The sound of a doorbell ringing caught her attention.
0:37:35|0:37:41|Upon opening the door, the couple [Zhao Kexin] and [Yu Bin] saw the kitchen knife in [Wang Yue]'s hand, and they were so scared that they kept backing away.
0:38:6|0:38:10|[Zhao Kexin] watched as [Wang Yue] became increasingly angry, [Yu Bin] quickly stepped in to comfort her.
0:39:5|0:39:21|[Zhao Kexin] and [Wang Yue] looked at [Zhao Gexin] with anger, ready to explode, leaving him surprised. After leaving home, [Ke Jianming] met [Meili] at a hotel. The two of them were deeply attached to each other in bed, reluctant to part. [Meili] lit a cigarette and handed it to [Ke Jianming] with a hint of ambiguity.
0:39:32|0:39:35|[Zhao Kexin] and [Yu Bin] stayed with [Wang Yue] all night, getting ready to leave.
0:39:47|0:40:6|Wang Yue sent off Zhao Kexin and her husband with a smile on her face, then lazily closed the door and stretched. She walked slowly towards the sofa, picked up a plump orange from the fruit plate on the coffee table, and prepared to peel it with her fingers, thinking slowly about the advice Zhao Kexin had given her.
0:40:16|0:40:35|She lowered her head to look at her plump figure, decisively put down the orange in her hand, took out two small apples from the fruit plate, and smiled happily. Wang [Wang Yue] contentedly nibbled on the apple and began her weight loss plan. In the gym, she sweated profusely and persevered in her workout.
0:40:35|0:40:39|In the park, she is dressed in sportswear, taking off her glasses and running energetically.
0:40:44|0:40:53|The sweat after exercise, the gradually defined collarbones, are all the results of her continuous efforts. All the equipment in the gym is easy for her to handle.
0:40:55|0:41:8|In the mint villa, Mother-in-law is in the living room, holding two large green onions, eating and dancing. After Cao Lan dressed up carefully, she slowly walked downstairs with her bag. Mother-in-law heard her movement, quickly stopped, turned around and walked towards the stairs.
0:41:47|0:41:49|Yu Bin pretended to walk angrily towards the window, [Zhao Kexin] quickly got up and walked to his side, gently comforting him.
0:42:35|0:42:44|[Zhao Kexin] picked up her bag and walked away, leaving her colleagues laughing and mocking at their workstations. Yu Bin walked out with Xiao Qu, singing a tune.
0:42:56|0:43:8|Yu Bin returned to the team without mercy, and then left empty-handed. After Zhao Kexin left the company, she secretly called Wang Yue. As soon as the call connected, she spoke.
0:43:31|0:43:41|[Wang Yue] hung up the phone with a happy face, [Ke Jianming] walked in, [Wang Yue] heard the movement, her smile gradually froze, but [Ke Jianming] approached her with a flattering look.
0:43:46|0:43:51|[Wang Yue] took the flowers he gave her, looking at him coldly, recalling [Zhao Kexin]'s words in her mind.
0:43:56|0:44:13|[Wang Yue] looked up and felt extremely sad as she gazed at [Ke Jianming]. His cold eyes gradually softened, and tears welled up uncontrollably in her eyes. Holding a bouquet of flowers, she sat on the sofa behind him, tears streaming down her face. Looking at the gorgeous flowers, she gently embraced herself.
0:44:13|0:44:17|Ke Jianming on the side looked at Wang Yue with a smug smile.
0:45:42|0:45:58|[Ke Jianming] walked to the desk, took out pen and paper, and started writing a letter of repentance. [Wang Yue] watched carefully beside him. In response to [Wang Yue]'s request, [Ke Jianming] showed disdain, holding the pen with a smug expression as he began to write. He already had a plan in mind, while [Wang Yue] closely monitored his every move.
0:46:43|0:46:52|Models are shooting, with [Yu Bin] standing aside observing their performance. Two models confidently walk out.
0:47:59|0:48:7|[Zhao Kexin] eagerly took the repentance letter from [Wang Yue]'s hand, and was shocked when she opened it.
0:48:41|0:48:51|The two entered the beauty salon happily, changed into comfortable clothes and lay on the bed, where professional beauticians started massaging them. [Zhao Kexin] looked at the ceiling above and softly said to [Wang Yue].
0:49:24|0:49:47|Can I do it? Of course you can't, you will definitely mess things up if you go, you don't have his skills and reflexes, you will only cause trouble. Suddenly, Cao Lan's remarks caught everyone's attention, [Zhao Kexin] sat up from the bed at once, staring at Cao Lan with a murderous look in her eyes.
0:49:47|0:49:56|Cao Lan, however, remained indifferent. The intense atmosphere between the two was evident in their eye contact, leaving [Wang Yue] feeling somewhat at a loss amidst the strong sense of gunpowder in the air.
0:50:40|0:50:49|[Zhao Kexin] and [Wang Yue], after getting makeovers, arrived at the restaurant with Cao Lan. Watching Cao Lan and [Wang Yue] chatting happily, [Zhao Kexin] looked at the two of them warily.
0:51:47|0:51:58|[Zhao Kexin] hit Cao Lan's sore spot with her words, she looked at [Zhao Kexin] sharply, but the other person looked smug. [Wang Yue] smiled at the childish behavior of the two, but then looked surprised.
0:52:8|0:52:21|[Zhao Kexin] slowly turned her head and saw [Yu Bin] with a long-haired beauty, stunned. Smoke seemed to rise from her head, her heart burning with anger, she shouted at [Yu Bin].
0:54:4|0:54:17|[Ke Jianming] pushed open the door cautiously after work, circled around the room, and was attracted by the beauty behind the screen. [Wang Yue] was wearing a hot and sexy nightgown, dancing behind the screen, showcasing her graceful curves on the screen.
0:54:17|0:54:29|With slender arms, a sexy waist, and alluring long legs, [Ke Jianming] couldn't take his eyes off. He slowly walked towards [Wang Yue], carefully approaching to check on her, and mysteriously said to her in the night.
0:54:48|0:55:4|[Wang Yue] did not answer his question, dancing and walking towards the living room. With lazy curls and graceful figure, she captivated [Ke Jianming]. He took off his suit jacket and casually threw it on the sofa, staring intently at [Wang Yue] dancing.
0:55:4|0:55:12|Soon after, he loosened his tie and danced with [Wang Yue]. In the midst of [Ke Jianming]'s confusion and infatuation, [Wang Yue] picked up a bowl of porridge from the table and fed it to him.
0:55:26|0:55:40|[Ke Jianming] had no doubt, took the porridge from [Wang Yue]'s hand and drank it all in one gulp. He placed the bowl on the table, gently wrapped his hands around [Wang Yue]'s waist. [Wang Yue] had long seen through his intentions and quickly turned around to stand behind him.
0:56:29|0:56:40|[Wang Yue] slowly stood up and held the sleepy [Ke Jianming] in her arms. Watching [Ke Jianming] slowly drift into sleep, [Wang Yue] gently placed him on the sofa behind her.
0:56:42|0:57:6|At this moment, [Ke Jianming] showed no response to the call. After confirming that [Ke Jianming] had fallen asleep, [Wang Yue] began to search through his suit jacket and, as expected, found a key in his pocket. Excited by the key, [Wang Yue] took off her clothes, grabbed the key, and went to meet up with [Zhao Kexin].
0:57:22|0:57:40|[Wang Yue] and [Zhao Kexin] happily drove away. The next morning, [Zhao Kexin] disguised herself and hid in the car, waiting outside the hotel for [Ke Jianming]. She checked the time, furrowed her brows, and stared at the entrance tightly. The long wait made her impatient. She sighed, but then the rearview mirror instantly woke her up.
0:57:40|0:57:53|He carefully observed the condition of his skin in front of the mirror. [Ke Jianming] walked out of the hotel at this moment, and [Zhao Kexin] watched his actions with big eyes, then quickly used a hat to cover her face, afraid of being discovered.
0:57:53|0:58:6|[Zhao Kexin] kept a close eye on [Ke Jianming]'s every move. When she saw him flag down a taxi on the roadside, she quickly started the engine, prepared to set off, loaded up her gear, and began to follow closely behind to track him.
0:58:6|0:58:21|On the spacious boulevard, [Zhao Kexin] stared intently at the taxi that [Ke Jianming] was riding in, keeping a close eye on its movements. In order not to be noticed by [Ke Jianming], he deliberately maintained a certain distance and followed closely. At this moment, [Ke Jianming] had no inkling that he was being tracked.
0:58:21|0:58:30|Ke Jianming walked into the hotel with a large bouquet of flowers, [Zhao Kexin] parked the car and stood at the hotel entrance, looking at the name of the hotel with a sense of foreboding.
0:58:33|0:58:44|Ke Jianming entered the elevator with a bouquet of flowers, familiar with the route. [Zhao Kexin], fully armed, kept a close eye on his movements, following closely behind. As the elevator doors opened, Ke Jianming stepped in first.
0:58:54|0:59:10|Zhao Kexin, wearing a hat and sunglasses, looked completely normal, but Ke Jianming didn't notice anything unusual. As the elevator doors slowly opened, the two entered the corridor one after the other. Zhao Kexin watched him standing at the door with flowers, ready to take out the key, and pretended to remain calm as she walked away.
0:59:10|0:59:21|Until the sound of the door opening, [Zhao Kexin] turned around to check the situation. Ke Jianming closed the door, and he quickly came to the door of the room, slightly bent down and leaned against the door to eavesdrop on the situation inside the room.
0:59:22|0:59:28|At this moment, [Wang Yue] was still dancing at home with full concentration. The phone rang, and she reluctantly stopped her dance.
0:59:29|0:59:31|The smile on [Wang Yue]'s face froze instantly.
0:59:55|1:0:4|[Wang Yue] was instantly flustered upon learning the situation, while [Yu Bin] was alone at home, taking out an ice cream and sitting on the sofa to watch TV.
1:0:52|1:1:17|Helen's heartfelt words plunged [Yu Bin] into deep thought. Cao Lan paced back and forth in the living room absentmindedly, and her mother-in-law quickly asked about it. Carrying a bag on her back, [Zhao Kexin] rang the doorbell, and Cao Lan, with a smile on her face, opened the door to greet her.
1:1:24|1:1:36|[Zhao Kexin]'s indifferent attitude did not affect Cao Lan, who warmly invited. The mother-in-law behind her was extremely reluctant and very worried, eager to find out the truth.
1:2:10|1:2:22|The mother-in-law was rejected at the door, but she didn't give up and started eavesdropping by lying on the door. [Zhao Kexin] happily entered the room, and the wedding photo on the wall caught her attention. The smile on her face disappeared instantly, and she pretended to say calmly.
1:3:20|1:3:29|Outside the door, the mother-in-law was completely confused. Inside, [Zhao Kexin] slowly turned around and suddenly raised her right hand, gently slapping Cao Lan's face.
1:4:29|1:4:40|In the bar, [Yu Bin] is drinking with Helen. His eyes are wandering, looking a bit lost. Helen across from him is gazing at him affectionately, speaking to him gently.
1:4:48|1:4:54|The two reached an agreement and raised their glasses together. Helen drank the red wine and said to [Yu Bin].
1:5:16|1:5:19|[Zhao Kexin] was ready to leave with her bag when she was stopped by [Yu Bin].
1:5:52|1:5:59|Please don't hesitate to like, subscribe, share, and support the Mingjing and Diandian programs.
1:6:7|1:6:25|[Zhao Kexin] immediately rejected [Yu Bin]'s request, turned and left the company without considering his feelings. She drove to a lakeside, parked the car steadily, and prepared to get out with her bag. [Wang Yue] was waiting for her alone by the lake, and when she got out of the car, she warmly greeted her.
1:7:21|1:7:29|[Zhao Kexin] nodded at him, affectionately placing her hand on his shoulder to comfort him silently. [Yu Bin] arrived at a restaurant and was sitting at the bar drinking alone.
1:7:47|1:7:55|[Zhao Kexin] picked up the wine glass and drank it all in one gulp, frowning and sighing. After [Wang Yue] finished the call, the two of them started to act.
1:8:18|1:8:28|[Wang Yue] watched nervously as he clutched his chest tightly, opened the door, while [Zhao Kexin] cautiously peeked inside to assess the situation. [Wang Yue] stood behind him, also looking eagerly into the room.
1:8:38|1:8:41|[Zhao Kexin] pulled [Wang Yue], who hesitated to move, into the room.
1:9:9|1:9:19|[Zhao Kexin] and [Wang Yue] heard the noise at the door and quickly hid on the balcony. [Ke Jianming] and [Dong Niang] swaggered into the room, leaving [Wang Yue] shocked by [Ke Jianming]'s inappropriate behavior.
1:9:41|1:9:52|[Wang Yue] was itching with anger at the door, [Zhao Kexin] took out a video camera from her bag and signaled to [Wang Yue]. After a brief eye contact, they started to act. [Zhao Kexin] opened the door and rushed into the room, starting to film.
1:15:0|1:15:12|In a luxurious villa, [Zhao Kexin] is lying in bed asleep. She habitually turns to the side, only to find the space next to her empty. She touches the soft pillow, suddenly wakes up, looking puzzled.
1:15:14|1:15:25|His face turned pale, feeling a sense of unease in his heart. He lifted the blanket and got out of bed, walking towards the living room. Opening the door, he saw [Yu Bin] sleeping soundly on the sofa. He angrily walked up and patted [Yu Bin] on the shoulder.
1:16:48|1:16:51|After [Yu Bin] finished speaking, he turned around arrogantly and left, leaving [Zhao Kexin] alone to reflect, unable to come back to his senses for a long time.
1:19:54|1:19:59|[Ke Jianming] looked at [Wang Yue], who was so firm in her attitude, and had to walk out of the house with his clothes.
1:20:1|1:20:13|[Ke Jianming] heard the loud closing of the door, deep in thought, he sighed and left. [Wang Yue], hearing the silence outside the door, leaned against the wall in despair, tears of sadness streaming down her face.
1:20:13|1:20:28|[Zhao Kexin] entered the company and saw employees whispering to each other. Curious, she approached to find out more, but the employees looked at her with caution. Seeing their strange behavior, she asked in confusion.
1:20:35|1:20:45|[Zhao Kexin] was suddenly flustered and quickly asked. At that moment, [Yu Bin] was leisurely drinking coffee at the bar. She walked up aggressively and asked [Yu Bin].
1:20:47|1:20:51|[Yu Bin] slowly stood up and looked at him with a serious expression.
1:21:1|1:21:16|Yu Bin turned around and left without any hesitation. [Zhao Kexin] had words on the tip of her tongue but didn't say them. After Yu Bin left the company, he arrived at the coast where a huge cruise ship emitted a loud roar. A bell rang, and Yu Bin took out his phone to read a text message.
1:21:20|1:21:23|He put down his phone, furrowed his brow, lost in thought.
1:21:24|1:21:39|[Zhao Kexin] drove to a resort, parked the car steadily, opened the door, and began to search for Yu Bin with an eager look on his face. He ran to the coast, looked around, but couldn't see Yu Bin. He quickly started searching at another part of the coast.
1:21:39|1:21:44|The last rays of the setting sun cast on the sea, [Zhao Kexin] ran to the beach, stood under a huge reef, and carefully searched.
1:21:45|1:22:3|Yu Bin, who had been missing from Kexin's sight, was sitting on the fence by the sea at this moment, looking into the distance with a worried expression. A small car slowly approached the shore, catching his attention. He lifted his head expressionlessly and watched the direction of the car. The car came to a steady stop, and Zhao Kexin got out of the car.
1:22:3|1:22:14|He watched [Yu Bin] with a happy face, running all the way to his side. Seeing his lively figure, [Yu Bin] slightly raised the corners of his mouth, turned his head to the side, while [Zhao Kexin] stared at [Yu Bin] without blinking and said.
1:22:59|1:23:9|[Zhao Kexin] hesitated to speak, [Yu Bin] stood up ready to leave. After [Zhao Kexin] finished speaking, my face blushed with embarrassment.
1:23:21|1:23:36|The misunderstanding between the two is finally resolved, and they sweetly embrace each other. [Wang Yue] is dressed in a sexy tight skirt, paired with black knee-high boots, getting ready to go out. [Ke Jianming] is shocked at the sight, then excitedly grabs a bouquet of flowers and runs towards [Wang Yue].
1:25:15|1:25:18|The lively drumbeats made Zhao Kexin nod in excitement.
1:28:15|1:28:23|[Yu Bin] thoughtfully helped [Zhao Kexin] take off her coat, then joined everyone in the middle of the dance floor to dance happily.
