0:3:14|0:3:30|[Wang Duoyu] stood up, took off his jacket, reached into his pocket and took out a tennis ball. He threw the ball towards the ceiling, it bounced back, and [Wang Duoyu] jumped up, making a diving motion as if catching the ball. The ball hit him in the face, and he fell heavily to the ground with his eyes closed. [Mr. Jin] sat motionless at the dining table.
0:3:51|0:3:58|[Wang Duoyu] flapped around on the floor like a fish out of water.
0:4:17|0:4:42|Mr. Jin gestured to his assistant to leave, then reached out to remove the bamboo cover on the table, revealing several stacks of cash. Wang Duoyu immediately widened his eyes at this sight, stood up in a hurry, and stared blankly at the cash on the table. He slowly walked towards it step by step, the stacks of cash standing out conspicuously on the green tablecloth. The scene suddenly shifted to the sports field.
0:5:2|0:5:52|Coach Daxiang excitedly cheers on the team, but [Wang Duoyu] remains expressionless. The referee stands between the two teams and tosses a coin into the air. The coin flips and the game begins. On the field, the players chase after the ball, [Wang Duoyu] stands in front of the net, bending down to focus on the ball. The members of Team Daxiang watch nervously, and [Mr. Jin] stands in the stands silently observing the game. At that moment, an opponent kicks the ball towards the goal, but [Wang Duoyu] leaps up and blocks it. The scene freezes and transitions back to the restaurant where it all began, [Wang Duoyu] reaches out to the money on the table and then walks away. The scene shifts back to the field, [Wang Duoyu] kicks the ball back and smiles, turning to look at [Mr. Jin] in the stands.
0:6:2|0:6:14|[Wang Duoyu] turned his head to [Mr. Jin] with a proud look on his face, waved his hand, and suddenly a ball flew into the net. He turned around in astonishment to look at the ball behind him, his whole body stunned, while the coach in the rest area exploded in anger.
0:6:18|0:6:32|[Mr. Jin] smiled and took a sip of water in the audience seats, and the score on the field instantly changed to 0:1. [Wang Duoyu] bent over with a determined look on his face, he reached out and pounded his own head with two fists, full of fighting spirit.
0:6:33|0:6:51|The game resumed amidst the cheers of the audience. Wang Duoyu furrowed his brows and stared fixedly at the football in front of him. The match intensified, and just then, the referee blew the whistle. The score on the big screen changed to 0:5, and Da Xiang team suffered a devastating loss.
0:6:57|0:7:20|The field was in chaos, with the audience shouting "fixed match" and the coach roaring towards the field, only to be stopped by the players. Mr. Jin raised his thumb and smiled happily, while Wang Duoyu couldn't handle the pressure and fell backwards, but was caught by a player from the opposing team before hitting the ground. He quickly thanked him. The players from the opposing team suddenly surrounded Wang Duoyu, lifted him over their heads, and threw him up.
0:7:30|0:7:42|The scene suddenly shifts from the basketball court to the entire West Rainbow City, and the title "The Richest Man in West Rainbow City" is revealed at this moment. A red electric tricycle is swiftly moving through the dilapidated streets, with [Zhuang Qiang] sitting in the car making a phone call, but no one answers.
0:7:52|0:7:57|A tricycle stopped at the entrance of a residential area, and [Zhuang Qiang] got off the car and ran inside after slamming the door.
0:8:1|0:8:25|He shouted Wang Duoyu's name loudly, but no one responded. Then he turned and ran upstairs, rushing to Wang Duoyu's door, raising his fist to knock. Zhuang Qiang squatted down and looked through the crack, seeing Wang Duoyu standing on a chair on tiptoe. Thinking his friend was going to hang himself, Zhuang Qiang stood up and rammed the door, but ended up knocking it down with too much force. He lay on the ground and lifted his head, only to see Wang Duoyu standing on a chair changing a light bulb.
0:8:41|0:8:47|[Zhuang Qiang] pulls back the curtains, revealing an old lady brushing her teeth in the room opposite. The scene then shifts to [Wang Duoyu] sitting in the car with a tattered bag in her arms.
0:9:42|0:10:10|[Wang Duoyu] turned his head and saw a dog standing in front of the goal as a goalkeeper, [Zhuang Qiang] threw his water cup to the ground. The coach burst into laughter upon hearing this. Looking at the coach clapping and laughing, [Zhuang Qiang] felt completely numb, holding the worn-out soccer ball against his seat with a sense of despair.
0:10:25|0:10:33|[Wang Duoyu] was talking tough while driving, but quickly hit the brakes when he saw the red light. [Zhuang Qiang] accidentally bumped his head on the car.
0:10:37|0:10:47|As soon as the words fell, a blob of bird droppings fell onto the windshield of the car. [Wang Duoyu] turned on the wipers, but the bird droppings were not wiped away.
0:10:51|0:11:4|[Zhuang Qiang] stared at [Wang Duoyu] without saying a word. At this moment, a man suddenly appeared in front of the car, threw the basket in his hand up, and vegetables and fruits scattered all over the ground. Then, the man let out a scream and fell to the ground.
0:11:12|0:11:27|The man on the ground quickly got up, walked to the car window and looked inside, then returned to his original position and lay down. [Wang Duoyu] and [Zhuang Qiang] opened the car door and got out. The man on the ground raised his hand to indicate a price.
0:13:56|0:14:9|[Wang Duoyu] was taken aback by Mr. Jin's words, his lips slightly parted, looking bewildered. Mr. Jin, on the other hand, had a mysterious expression. Soon after, [Wang Duoyu] and [Zhuang Qiang] were taken to the building of West Rainbow Life Insurance.
0:14:21|0:14:28|[Zhuang Qiang] tried to follow [Wang Duoyu] inside, but was stopped by the bodyguard. [Wang Duoyu] then walked into the lobby of the insurance company with [Mr. Jin].
0:15:28|0:15:39|Mr. Jin raised his cane and told Wang Duoyu about this. Wang Duoyu trembled, unable to stand steady for a moment, and fell back on the sofa, holding his chest without speaking for a long time.
0:15:50|0:16:5|[Mr. Jin] pressed the button on the remote control, the curtains in the hall were drawn, the projector was turned on, and Er Ye appeared on the screen holding a ventilator. He was sitting in a magnificent living room, gasping for breath, his eyes wide open.
0:16:27|0:16:52|Er Ye got so excited that his false teeth fell out. He picked them up and put them back on. Mr. Jin raised his hand and slapped Wang Duoyu. Wang Duoyu tried to fight back but was stopped by Mr. Jin, with the sound of the crew laughing in his ears.
0:17:12|0:17:18|On the screen appeared the introduction of inheriting 30 billion rules.
0:18:52|0:18:55|[Wang Duoyu] had a vacant look in his eyes.
0:21:15|0:21:38|[Xia Zhu] turned around and followed out, while outside, [Zhuang Qiang] was staring at the bodyguard. [Zhuang Qiang] turned his head and saw [Xia Zhu] explode. [Xia Zhu] took a deep breath, then continued to walk forward with a smile on her face, deliberately hitting [Wang Duoyu] with her handbag as she passed by.
0:21:52|0:22:38|[Zhuang Qiang] followed [Wang Duoyu] into the elevator, and the elevator doors closed slowly. Everyone arrived at the vault, and the staff slowly opened the vault door. [Wang Duoyu] and [Zhuang Qiang] stood behind [Mr. Jin] waiting. [Wang Duoyu] remained expressionless, showing great composure, while [Zhuang Qiang] turned to look at the two assistants holding chairs. Everyone walked into the vault together, the lights illuminating row by row, piles of cash neatly arranged inside the room. [Zhuang Qiang] and [Wang Duoyu] widened their eyes in astonishment, their legs went weak, and they both fell backwards. The two assistants behind them swiftly pushed the chairs in their hands forward to catch them.
0:22:41|0:22:52|[Zhuang Qiang] and [Wang Duoyu] were fumbling with their two legs, trying to struggle to stand up. [Xia Zhu] looked at the two of them with a puzzled expression on her face.
0:22:58|0:23:27|[Zhuang Qiang] and [Wang Duoyu] legs went weak, they collapsed on the ground, and finally had to lie on chairs, being pushed by two assistants. They both used all their strength to hold onto the chair backs, moving step by step in the vault with weak steps. Then they filled four bags with cash, laughing wildly as they ran out. The people in the bank were all shocked, and the security guard at the door stopped them. A staff member reached out and slapped the security guard. The security guard quickly bowed and apologized.
0:23:48|0:24:1|The security guard threw the baton into the arms of the staff, cheered and somersaulted out while running, accidentally knocking down the isolation belt. [Wang Duoyu] walked out of the bank's gate with several security guards.
0:24:16|0:24:39|[Wang Duoyu] patted [Zhuang Qiang] on the shoulder, then turned and continued walking outward. The members of Daxiang team were practicing hard to play football. The cramped field in the run-down residential area looked particularly shabby, and [Wang Duoyu] walked over with [Zhuang Qiang] in a very chic manner.
0:24:56|0:25:6|The team members surrounded [Wang Duoyu] when they saw him. At this moment, a row of luxury cars stopped on the side of the street, and a lady got out of the car, kicked the door, then ran towards [Xia Zhu].
0:26:25|0:26:35|[Zhuang Qiang] took out a walkie-talkie and handed it to [Wang Duoyu]. Just as he finished speaking, a bulldozer came driving towards them from the front. The team members collectively turned their heads to look at the bulldozer.
0:26:52|0:27:1|[Xia Zhu] and the lady beside her turned to look at the field, where the excavator tilted down and cash scattered down. The coach beside them suddenly collapsed to the ground.
0:27:19|0:27:27|The players of the team sat in luxury cars, throwing their clothes around and shouting loudly, each one showing extreme excitement and arrogance.
0:28:29|0:28:52|[Xia Zhu] proudly talks about her boyfriend, and [Wang Duoyu] looks disdainful after listening. A fleet of luxury cars stops in front of a very luxurious European-style hotel. The team members look up at the hotel and then get out of the cars and walk in. Inside the hotel is magnificent, with carved beams and painted pillars. Everyone is stunned as they enter, wandering around as if they have never seen such luxury before.
0:28:57|0:29:7|The coach saw a live peacock in the hotel. The waiters whispered to each other as the crowd surged in.
0:31:12|0:31:22|[Xia Zhu] looked at the smug [Wang Duoyu], raised her eyes helplessly, and soon the waiter brought a luxurious feast to the table.
0:33:29|0:33:38|[Wang Duoyu] stood up and winked at [Xia Zhu]. [Wang Duoyu] stood up and walked to the microphone.
0:34:7|0:34:21|Wang Duoyu clapped alone in front of the microphone, [Zhuang Qiang] ran over in tears and hugged him, [Xia Zhu] sighed helplessly at this, [Zhuang Qiang] reached out and took the crab shell from Wang Duoyu's hand, crying as he said.
0:34:40|0:35:4|Zhuang Qiang waved his right hand as he spoke. Everyone turned to look at [Zhuang Qiang]. He held up the crab shell that [Wang Duoyu] had given him and loudly started barking like a dog in the restaurant, leaving everyone stunned. The scene transitioned from the restaurant to the bedroom, where a barber was cutting [Wang Duoyu]'s hair.
0:35:12|0:35:18|The barber picked up the box and left, then [Xia Zhu] walked in and looked at [Wang Duoyu] who was looking in the mirror.
0:37:9|0:37:14|[Wang Duoyu] turned around and ran to the safe to get a stack of money, then ran back to [Liu Jiannan] and handed the money to him.
0:37:23|0:37:31|[Wang Duoyu] smacked his lips, then took out a stack of money and handed it to [Liu Jiannan]. [Liu Jiannan] looked at the money in his arms, dumbfounded.
0:39:8|0:39:17|[Wang Duoyu] looked at [Zhuang Qiang]'s notebook, which was filled with gratitude.
0:40:25|0:40:40|A man in swimwear burst in. He walked up to the machine he brought, flipped open the metal barrel on top, and then lay inside it, sticking his head into the toilet filled with water in front of the metal barrel, simulating a few freestyle movements. After that, he jumped off the machine, while the others in the room watched him dumbfoundedly.
0:40:56|0:41:17|Several security guards suddenly rushed out and grabbed the arm of the man in swimwear, trying to drag him out. The man in swimwear excitedly broke free from the guards' grasp, took a big step and jumped onto the long table in the conference room, waving his arms and dancing joyfully. [Wang Duoyu] couldn't help but start moving along with him.
0:41:34|0:41:41|A security guard suddenly raised his hand, then quickly took a few steps and placed a map on the table.
0:42:26|0:42:34|The security guard also got excited and jumped onto the conference table, twisting around.
0:42:53|0:43:24|The chef, the maid, the waiters, and everyone in the meeting room stood up and shouted loudly. Countless people jumped onto the meeting room, happily dancing on top. [Wang Duoyu] and [Zhuang Qiang] also stood on the side and danced along. [Xia Zhu] was helplessly keeping track of the accounts on the side, while the cash in the vault, which was originally piled up, was now decreasing stack by stack. The night of revelry in the brightly lit hotel gradually came to an end as the sky brightened. [Wang Duoyu] lay on a massage bed shirtless, with a beautiful masseuse massaging his back.
0:45:1|0:45:22|[Wang Duoyu] explained to [Xia Zhu] as he walked out, and [Xia Zhu] smiled without saying a word. The maids in the courtyard were cleaning. Everyone warmly greeted [Wang Duoyu].
0:45:49|0:46:1|Wearing a gardener's uniform, [Liu Jiannan] pointed at the vegetation beside him and said, [Liu Jiannan] watched as [Wang Duoyu] left, but then turned to see [Xia Zhu] with a cold expression.
0:46:15|0:46:30|[Xia Zhu] left with a lot of anger. The scene shifted from the garden to the golf course.
0:46:45|0:47:2|Mr. Lai and Mr. Yin, two trust fund employees, are conspiring with the female masseuse just now? At this moment, [Wang Duoyu] suddenly wearing sunglasses, leading the players of Da Xiang team, walked over gracefully. A stadium staff member quickly ran a few steps to Mr. Yin and Mr. Lai.
0:47:9|0:47:22|The female masseuse standing aside took a sharp breath and lowered her head, while [Wang Duoyu] took off his sunglasses and looked at him. Mr. Jin and Mr. Lai not far away also looked a bit flustered.
0:47:38|0:47:44|The scene transitions from the golf course to the restaurant, where the players are gathered together, enjoying lobster and red wine, having a great time.
0:47:49|0:48:8|The coach and players of Team Daxiang were eating without any image, Mr. Yin and Mr. Lai quietly picked up the red wine next to them to toast, [Wang Duoyu] suddenly appeared and took away the wine glasses from their hands.
0:48:37|0:48:47|[Wang Duoyu] turned to look at Mr. Lai with a disdainful expression, slowly widening his eyes. The roar grew louder and louder, and a plane landed at the airport.
0:50:27|0:50:34|[Xia Zhu] awkwardly asked, "Mr. Wang, may I ask if you offer a monthly lunch plan?"
0:51:12|0:51:37|Lafite's car quickly drove out of the hotel. [Xia Zhu] watched the disappearing luxury car, feeling completely hopeless. She walked lost in the street. [Wang Duoyu] drove his sports car and followed, handing a tissue to the crying [Xia Zhu]. [Xia Zhu] took the tissue and threw it at [Wang Duoyu].
0:52:48|0:53:18|After he finished speaking, he smiled and drove away, leaving [Xia Zhu] standing alone, coughing uncontrollably in the face of the exhaust fumes. As the sun rose, a new day began. [Wang Duoyu] was sound asleep in bed, lifting his bare arm to move the pillow covering his face aside. Slowly opening his hazy eyes, he saw a row of waiters approaching with food. He got up and went to the bathroom to enjoy a petal bath, surrounded by maids who helped him bathe, brush his teeth, trim his nails, and give him a massage.
0:53:40|0:54:2|He walked out of the hotel and jumped into the swimming pool in the courtyard. The water in the pool was crystal clear, and [Wang Duoyu] slowly floated up from the bottom of the pool, moving his arms in a freestyle swimming posture and swimming forward slowly. After a while, he swam from the 1.2-meter saltwater area to the 2-meter deep water area. Suddenly, [Wang Duoyu] struggled and sank down. The security guards on both sides quickly dove into the water, rescued him from the bottom of the pool, and carried him to the edge of the pool by his arms.
0:54:11|0:54:20|[Wang Duoyu] hunched over, curled up his body, and tightly hugged his arms as he left the swimming pool. The maids rushed over to him. Some used towels to wipe his body, some held hair dryers to blow his hair, some held cotton swabs to clean his nostrils, and some held pajamas for him to put on.
0:54:27|0:54:37|After enjoying the service of the maids, [Wang Duoyu] dressed neatly and swayed his body, leading a group of people through the luxurious hall to the outdoor balcony. Leaning against the railing, he looked down, where [Liu Jiannan] and a bunch of people in the courtyard were smiling and greeting him.
0:55:0|0:55:4|Everyone in the conference room was clapping and smiling, leaving [Wang Duoyu] feeling confused.
0:55:30|0:55:38|[Wang Duoyu], with a face full of despair, rushed towards the main seat.
0:56:28|0:56:36|[Wang Duoyu] lay weakly on the ground, only to find the man who invented the land cruiser hiding under the table in his swimsuit.
0:56:44|0:56:51|[Wang Duoyu] drove everyone away and went crazy alone in the conference room, while [Xia Zhu] and a few others stood on the second floor with puzzled expressions.
0:57:25|0:57:29|The financial program host lavished praise on [Wang Duoyu], while Mr. Jin and Mr. Lai were laughing heartily while holding their stomachs.
0:57:39|0:58:3|[Wang Duoyu] squatted on a messy conference table, constantly slapping himself. As night fell, [Wang Duoyu] sneaked into a small grove under the cover of darkness. He quietly opened a large package filled with cash, intending to burn the money with a lighter. However, the lighter malfunctioned. He threw the lighter to the ground and looked up to see a person burning paper money. The person burning paper money turned around.
0:58:16|0:58:24|[Wang Duoyu] woke up from his dream in an instant, gasping for breath as he sat up.
0:58:57|0:59:6|[Wang Duoyu] followed Zhuang Qiang into the living room, where a broad and stout man stood next to the sofa. This man, known as Big Smart, had a face full of stubble and was holding a folding fan.
1:0:25|1:0:35|On the other side, [Xia Zhu] was sitting alone in front of the sofa celebrating his birthday. He blew out the candles and casually threw them into the trash can.
1:0:39|1:0:47|Good evening, Wang Duoyu brings you a surprise, Xia Zhu took the flowers from Liu Jiannan with a smile, and the two walked into the house.
1:0:59|1:1:13|[Xia Zhu] angrily threw the flowers onto the cabinet, [Liu Jiannan] picked up [Xia Zhu]'s birthday cake, and ate it with a spoon while expressing disdain.
1:1:16|1:1:26|[Liu Jiannan] turned on the light, then turned back to continue eating cake. [Xia Zhu] stood beside him with wide eyes, unable to say a word for a long time.
1:1:59|1:2:8|[Xia Zhu] slammed the cake onto [Liu Jiannan]'s face. Meanwhile, [Wang Duoyu] was drinking alcohol.
1:2:32|1:2:50|The sound of firecrackers resounded one after another, and colorful fireworks suddenly burst in the distant sky, brightening the dark night instantly. The whole city was shimmering with a colorful glow.
1:2:50|1:2:59|[Wang Duoyu] rested his arm on [Xia Zhu]'s shoulder, with a relaxed smile on his face, while [Xia Zhu] looked up at the fireworks display in front of him, tears of excitement streaming down his face.
1:3:0|1:3:13|Hotel maids and staff gathered excitedly by the window, watching the beautiful moment in the sky, while [Wang Duoyu] swayed on the balcony, making conductor-like gestures, dancing joyfully next to [Xia Zhu].
1:3:14|1:3:41|Beautiful fireworks are blooming in every corner of the city. People on the streets and alleys are stopping in their tracks, looking up at the fireworks with intoxicated expressions. Men drinking on the road pause their toasting, while wives who were about to scold their husbands at home instead pull them close for a kiss. Adorable cats jump down from the railing to sit next to the dogs, both enjoying the colorful display in the distance.
1:3:41|1:4:0|This sudden fireworks display lasted for a long time. [Wang Duoyu] was dancing more and more vigorously on the balcony, while the smile on [Xia Zhu]'s face grew bigger. As the music faded away, [Wang Duoyu] made a final move, and the fireworks gradually came to an end. He turned around and looked at [Xia Zhu].
1:5:22|1:5:59|Xia Zhu's face was full of seriousness. She took a few steps out and then returned. Wang Duoyu watched Xia Zhu leave, then turned around and started talking to himself. He took a step forward, picked up the red wine in front of him and drank it in one gulp. A large red airship was slowly flying in the sky above the city. Xia Zhu was sitting by the window, getting ready to enjoy breakfast.
1:6:23|1:6:39|[Xia Zhu] looked puzzled, but when she looked up at a passerby's phone, she saw her own photo on the station advertisement. She stood up in a panic and looked at other billboards, completely dumbfounded.
1:6:47|1:7:0|[Xia Zhu] was surrounded by passersby, with an airship slowly flying overhead. [Mr. Jin] sat on a massage chair holding a telescope, looking at the airship. One side of it read "Wang Duoyu loves Xia Zhu", while the other side read "Xia Zhu, I like you".
1:7:25|1:7:50|[Xia Zhu] awkwardly blocked in the men's restroom talking to [Wang Duoyu]. The man outside preparing to urinate was instantly stunned. [Xia Zhu], facing the strange looks of the people around, limped to the car. He covered his head with a towel and waved to the driver, who casually turned on the radio. The song requested by Mr. Jin for Miss [Xia Zhu] followed.
1:8:18|1:8:43|The driver secretly observed Xia Zhu through the rearview mirror. Just then, the man who had staged a car accident with Wang Duoyu before used the same method to collide with them. The driver angrily got out of the car, while Xia Zhu, sitting in the back seat, seemed to have figured something out.
1:8:43|1:9:1|He gradually widened his eyes, opened his mouth, wanting to speak but unable to, while on the other side, [Wang Duoyu] was practicing in the hotel lobby with [Zhuang Qiang], and the disheveled [Xia Zhu] suddenly walked in. [Wang Duoyu] glanced back, then slowly stood up straight, [Xia Zhu] gathered courage and spoke,
1:9:9|1:9:16|The scene gradually transitions from the lobby to the concert venue, with [Wang Leehom] himself sitting on the stage singing passionately.
1:9:39|1:9:52|Wang Leehom sang and played the guitar, halfway through, he even winked at the audience waving glow sticks below the stage. [Xia Zhu] immediately grabbed [Wang Duoyu]'s hand and screamed, while [Wang Duoyu] sat beside with a faint smile, calmly watching the overly excited [Xia Zhu].
1:9:56|1:10:13|After a while, [Xia Zhu] gradually calmed down from his excitement. He quietly supported his chin with both hands, his eyes staring at Wang Leehom without blinking. Then he suddenly turned to look at [Wang Duoyu], only to see the other person uncomfortably shifting his gaze away, and then pretending to follow the music, swaying his body.
1:10:23|1:10:42|The conversation suddenly shifted, and the sentimental song became very cheerful. Everyone stood on the stage waving their hands and twisting their bodies. Wang Leehom sat on the side of the stage swaying and singing. At this moment, Wang Duoyu also stood up to dance with Xia Zhu. Everyone paired up and gathered in groups of three or five, happily playing together.
1:10:45|1:10:52|[Xia Zhu] suddenly screamed and rushed to Wang Leehom, grabbing his hand. The excitement of successfully meeting her idol was written all over her face.
1:10:52|1:11:20|[Wang Duoyu] then rushed up and grabbed Wang Leehom's hand, and then held his face with both hands and shook it for a while. Wang Leehom's face was full of horror. A concert full of surprises gradually came to an end. [Xia Zhu] and [Wang Duoyu] finally went on stage and took a photo with Wang Leehom. Everyone walked out of the concert venue, sat on the roadside, drank red wine, and ate hot pot. [Wang Duoyu] took the initiative to help [Xia Zhu] pick up food, and [Xia Zhu] looked embarrassed.
1:11:20|1:11:45|After finishing the hotpot, [Wang Duoyu] played soccer with a group of children. The children kept kicking the ball towards [Wang Duoyu], and each time he managed to catch it in different poses. Watching him, [Xia Zhu] looked at him with admiration. Seeing [Wang Duoyu] playing on the field, [Xia Zhu] decided to join in. He gestured provocatively towards [Wang Duoyu], then kicked the ball that was flying towards him with force, accidentally kicking it away along with the ball.
1:11:56|1:12:19|[Wang Duoyu] ran ahead holding a shoe, while [Xia Zhu] chased after him laughing. The two of them were playing and chasing each other on the crowded street, looking as happy as two children who never grew up. One was laughing, the other was fooling around, one was walking forward, the other was walking backward. As they walked, [Xia Zhu] covered [Wang Duoyu]'s clothes over his head and then ran away laughing. Gradually, it started to drizzle in the sky.
1:12:22|1:12:43|[Xia Zhu] sat in the driver's seat, happily humming a song, while [Wang Duoyu] fell asleep next to her, mumbling in his sleep. [Xia Zhu] turned off the music, listened to what [Wang Duoyu] was saying, his smile suddenly froze on his face, then he angrily sat up straight.
1:13:19|1:13:32|On the other side, Mr. Jin and Mr. Lai told Liu Jiannan about Wang Duoyu's secret, while the beautiful masseuse Sasha climbed next to Liu Jiannan in a sexy red dress.
1:13:34|1:13:43|Sasa fell off the table, then struggled to get up. Mr. Jin walked over and whispered something in Liu Jiannan's ear.
1:13:50|1:14:1|Mr. Lai stood up and lifted the tablecloth in front of him, revealing a large box of cash. [Liu Jiannan] looked at the wealth within easy reach not far away, his originally righteous expression suddenly turning sycophantic.
1:14:5|1:14:14|After he finished speaking, he took a deep breath and buried his face in Sasha's chest, and the camera returned to the field.
1:14:45|1:14:53|[Wang Duoyu] looked up and saw the players of Da Xiang team dancing in a circle, with the coach in the middle drinking red wine, and others sitting around cheering.
1:15:56|1:16:8|[Wang Duoyu] raised his hand and slapped [Zhuang Qiang], who then howled and ran to the side of the pool before jumping in.
1:16:30|1:17:19|[Wang Duoyu] was completely submerged in the water, gradually emerging from his memories. He then stood up in the middle of the pool, dripping wet, and walked towards [Zhuang Qiang] step by step. Looking at the dejected [Zhuang Qiang], [Wang Duoyu] smiled and playfully pinched his face. Riding away on his bicycle alone, leaving the other players stunned, [Wang Duoyu] went to find [Mr. Jin] by himself. Through the window, it could be seen that the two of them were discussing something.
1:17:19|1:17:32|The two then embraced briefly, seemingly reaching some agreement, before the scene cut back to the luxurious hotel. [Zhuang Qiang] and Wang Duoyu, one sitting on the sofa and the other standing by the window. Suddenly, Xia Zhu burst in and asked.
1:17:45|1:18:2|[Zhuang Qiang] quickly stood up and picked up his phone to check the message. On the other side, [Wang Duoyu] was sipping red wine with a straw, and he casually picked up the horn and blew it. Numerous reporters were sitting below.
1:19:27|1:19:44|[Wang Duoyu] turned around, raised both hands, and the banners hanging on the walls on both sides dropped down, with countless flyers fluttering down.
1:20:57|1:21:17|Mr. Lai and Mr. Yin held up newspapers to demand an explanation from [Mr. Jin], but they got nothing. The fat insurance was officially launched in the city, with advertisements for fat insurance on big screens and at stations everywhere. In the sky above the city, a yellow airship with three large characters "fat insurance" and five small characters "four two push a thousand catties" slowly flew by.
1:21:50|1:22:10|The staff continued to check him, unexpectedly finding a huge piece of ribs from his clothes. The male customer did not give up, but instead, under the terrified gaze of the staff, picked up a large bucket of water and drank it all. A fat man was kicked off the elevator because of being overweight. He looked back and saw a fat insurance advertisement on the elevator, as if making a decision. A group of fat people were running hard on the street, many people in the gym were using fitness equipment to exercise desperately, and office workers in the office building gave up the convenient elevator one by one, rushing to the stairs and running on the steps very consciously.
1:22:39|1:22:50|He was shocked by the surveillance footage, with crowded streets filled with running crowds, hardly any vehicles in sight. Even the traffic police couldn't help but whistle, directing traffic while swaying their bodies.
1:22:57|1:23:24|In front of the company building, the elevator was empty, and employees were jumping up the stairs on the side. The park was crowded with people, many of whom were exercising with sports equipment. Several land yachts invented by a man in a swimsuit were placed nearby. A few people wearing swim caps were lying on them, imitating the movements of freestyle swimming. Meanwhile, the staff at the notary office were frantically calculating data, and the cash counting machine worked endlessly as stacks of cash were taken away by customers, some crying and some laughing. Within the perimeter guarded by security guards, the once mountain-like pile of 2 billion cash was slowly decreasing.
1:23:41|1:24:1|[Wang Duoyu] stood at the top of the insurance company building, wearing a red shirt and green pants, with one hand behind his back and the other hand holding onto a huge "thin" character. With legs crossed and a face of enjoyment, he closed his eyes and leaned against the "thin" character. The camera slowly rose and stretched, making [Wang Duoyu] smaller and smaller, until he completely disappeared.
1:24:9|1:24:16|The scene transitioned from the exterior of West Rainbow City to the indoor West Rainbow City Annual Influential Figure Awards Ceremony, where [Wang Duoyu] received the trophy from the guests.
1:24:32|1:24:36|[Xia Zhu] leaned against the door, clapping for [Wang Duoyu] on stage with a smile.
1:24:54|1:24:59|[Gao Ran] walked forward with a disdainful expression. The scene cut back to the field, where the highly anticipated match was about to begin.
1:25:5|1:25:14|The audience on site is predominantly in support of the Hengtai team, with only a few supporters of the Daxiang team surrounded among them.
1:25:34|1:25:47|[Gao Ran] stood in the middle of the field, his face filled with pride. At that moment, a distant roar was suddenly heard, and the audience looked up to see three helicopters flying in from the distance.
1:25:47|1:26:4|[Wang Duoyu] sat expressionless with earphones on, as a helicopter roared louder and louder. The helicopter slowly approached the stadium, capturing everyone's attention. The supporters of Team Daxiang collectively cheered.
1:26:11|1:26:31|Liu Jiannan, dressed in black, with a disdainful expression on his face, the helicopter slowly landed in the center of the field. Gao Ran stared fiercely at the helicopter as the coach of the Daxiang team descended gracefully from the aircraft. However, his charm lasted only three seconds, as he stumbled after a few steps and vomited, leaving Gao Ran dumbfounded as he watched the coach retching.
1:26:33|1:26:52|Shortly after, [Wang Duoyu] also walked down from the helicopter with [Zhuang Qiang]. Supporters of Da Xiang team shouted loudly as the helicopter in the middle of the field slowly rose into the air and gradually flew away from the stadium. The scene suddenly switched to outside the field, where substitute players were sitting on chairs taking care of the coach who felt airsick.
1:26:57|1:27:17|The match is about to begin on the court, Gao Ran gestured two fingers towards [Wang Duoyu], who then made a "peace" sign back at him. The whistle blew, and the game between Hengtai team and Daxiang team started. Suddenly, [Zhuang Qiang] stepped forward and grabbed Gao Ran's hand. He then reached out and touched Gao Ran's abdominal muscles.
1:27:34|1:27:41|Gao Ran suddenly sensed something was wrong, turned around and punched [Zhuang Qiang] in the face. The scene instantly descended into chaos, with [Zhuang Qiang] lying on the ground with rolled-back eyes, and [Wang Duoyu] hurriedly running over.
1:27:57|1:28:14|Gao Ran angrily threw his clothes on the ground and left, the match resumed. A player from Hengtai team dribbled the ball and shot, [Wang Duoyu] desperately tried to block in front of the goal, but still couldn't save the goal. [Liu Jiannan] cheered in the audience, and Da Xiang's coach lay down upon seeing this scene.
1:28:14|1:28:36|The supporters of Team Daxiang frowned and sighed repeatedly. [Xia Zhu] sat in the audience with a look of anxiety and nervousness on her face. When she looked up, she saw the players of Team Hengtai taking consecutive shots on the field, and [Wang Duoyu] didn't save a single goal. The first half of the game ended with the score at 0:8, with Team Hengtai in the lead. [Wang Duoyu] was throwing a tantrum in the locker room at this moment.
1:29:40|1:29:52|Wang Duoyu from Daxiang team took a shot in front of the goal, but it was saved by the opposing goalkeeper. Hengtai rolled the ball around in his arms for two laps, then quickly got up and kicked the ball out.
1:30:1|1:30:33|[Wang Duoyu] and his teammates ran back desperately, but they were still a step too slow. The score became 0:9, and [Wang Duoyu] knelt on the ground in frustration. Gao Ran was outside the field, giving two thumbs up and shouting loudly. The game continued, with the players of Daxiang team standing very neatly in front of the goal. The players of Hengtai team smiled at each other, and one of them suddenly kicked the ball into the face of an opponent player, who instantly fell to the ground.
1:30:50|1:30:57|[Xia Zhu] opened the account book in her hand and shouted at [Liu Jiannan],
1:31:12|1:31:24|Liu Jiannan's face changed instantly, he looked at the arena and swallowed a mouthful of saliva, then opened his mouth to tell Wang Duoyu's secret to Xia Zhu.
1:31:37|1:31:48|[Xia Zhu] listened to Liu Jiannan's words, her face instantly turning pale. She looked at the serious expression on Liu Jiannan's face, trying to process what he had just said. After a while, [Xia Zhu] turned to look at Wang Duoyu on the field, lost in memories.
1:32:7|1:32:15|[Xia Zhu] recalled every moment spent with [Wang Duoyu], feeling numb all over. Liu Jiannan reached out and put his arm around [Xia Zhu]'s shoulder.
1:32:34|1:33:15|[Xia Zhu] listened expressionlessly as Liu Jiannan spoke, then slapped him with a file bag. "I will tell everything to Mr. Jin," [Xia Zhu] said before turning and running away. Liu Jiannan hurriedly chased after [Xia Zhu], while on the field, players from Da Xiang team were falling one by one as the opponent's ball hit their heads repeatedly. Outside the field, [Xia Zhu] ran desperately, with Liu Jiannan closely following behind, seemingly able to grab him with just one reach. Meanwhile, on the field, Wang Duoyu seemed to have found his rhythm, intercepting several balls in a row.
1:33:31|1:33:48|[Xia Zhu] was still running awkwardly in the alley, and the game was in a tense state. A ball flew over, and [Wang Duoyu] hurriedly used his body to catch it. He inadvertently lowered his head to look at the ball, only to find bloodstains on it. He turned his head back and saw a tall and thin team member who had been hit by the ball, his face swollen and unable to open his eyes.
1:33:48|1:33:56|Two other teammates helped him up, and he stood silently in front of the goal without saying a word. The audience watched the scene in front of them and fell silent in an instant.
1:34:0|1:34:36|The members of Da Xiang team stood in front of the goal one by one, each with scars on their faces. [Wang Duoyu] and the coach on the sidelines looked at the seriously injured players in front of them, their faces filled with heartache and reluctance. Hengtai team members lined up to take shots, one ball after another hitting the faces, heads, and bodies of the Da Xiang team members heavily. They fell down and got up again, with a look of evasion and fear on their faces, but no one dodged, and no one escaped in the face of the battle.
1:36:11|1:36:46|The commentator stood up in surprise as he saw Coach Wang Duoyu of Team Daxiang changing into the team uniform and warming up on the sidelines. The coach, with his back to the field, looked around and then raised his left arm, extending his index finger towards the audience in a victorious gesture. He then put down his arm, patted his chest, and ran towards the field amidst the cheers of the crowd. Suddenly, he stepped on a mineral water bottle and fell to the ground, shocking everyone present. The scene fell silent instantly. The coach was carried away on a stretcher by two staff members, covering his face and crying.
1:36:49|1:36:53|The audience gradually realized and cheered for the Da Xiang team again, with [Wang Duoyu] turning his head to look at [Zhuang Qiang].
1:37:17|1:37:36|The football came flying at high speed, and [Wang Duoyu] jumped up to intercept it, but his hand once again missed the ball by a hair's breadth. [Wang Duoyu] failed to stop the ball. The scene on the field seemed to freeze at that moment, as the countdown to the end of the match began.
1:37:50|1:38:6|The football continued to move forward in the air, and the audience outside the field saw this most crucial goal and went crazy, shouting and dancing. "I don't owe you anything," at this critical moment, [Zhuang Qiang] suddenly knelt down and used his lower body to block the ball.
1:38:6|1:38:14|The football rebounded from his body to [Wang Duoyu]'s front. Seeing this, [Wang Duoyu] hurriedly pounced over and grabbed the ball.
1:38:22|1:38:45|The commentator stood up excitedly, and the audience cheered along. The members of the Elephant team were also jubilant, running on the field, hugging each other, rolling on the ground, and shouting with joy, their happiness overflowing. On the other side, the Hengtai team members were one by one frustrated, all sitting there with furrowed brows and gloomy faces, as if they were the ones who had lost.
1:38:46|1:38:57|[Wang Duoyu] and [Zhuang Qiang] are lying on the grass holding hands, their faces filled with happiness. The competition has come to an end, with Hengtai team in the first place and Daxiang team in the second place, ready for the award ceremony.
1:38:58|1:39:16|The award presenter took out a mini trophy from the big trophy and handed it to Gao Ran, then passed the big trophy to [Wang Duoyu]. The Da Xiang team cheered happily, while the Heng Tai team was completely stunned on the side. [Wang Duoyu] took the microphone and began to speak.
1:40:25|1:40:46|Everyone at the scene was immersed in the ocean of joy, except for Wang Duoyu, who looked panicked and frightened upon receiving a phone call. He looked around and took the phone away from his ear, only to see a photo of Xia Zhu being kidnapped on the screen. Wang Duoyu, accompanied by a few bodyguards, stormed into the bar where Mr. Lai and Mr. Yin were playing with a beautiful woman.
1:40:48|1:40:58|The bodyguards smashed things in the room, then Mr. Lai and Mr. Yin were tied together, and then they were frightened with a compass and alcohol cotton.
1:41:10|1:41:16|[Wang Duoyu] raised both hands and waved them forward, and two bodyguards held up electric fly swatters and placed them on Mr. Yin and Mr. Lai's mouths.
1:41:53|1:41:58|In the video, a man kicked [Liu Jiannan] off the building.
1:42:20|1:42:30|[Wang Duoyu] was completely scared silly, for a moment not knowing what to do. The scene shifted to the abandoned building, where [Liu Jiannan] was hanging upside down in mid-air, so scared that he even wet himself.
1:43:17|1:43:34|[Xia Zhu] reluctantly let go of the hand reaching for the phone, and [Mr. Jin] answered the call immediately.
1:45:5|1:45:11|Xia Zhu was on the verge of tears as she listened to Wang Duoyu's words.
1:45:24|1:45:52|Sasa lifted her leg and sat on [Wang Duoyu], hugging him tightly. Suddenly, it started to rain outside, the rain hitting the old iron railing of the abandoned building, creating an indescribable sense of melancholy. As time passed by, [Xia Zhu] was restless with worries, while [Mr. Jin] leisurely sipped his tea on the side, and [Liu Jiannan] curled up next to him. The man disguised as a kidnapper handed him the hot water, but despite being thirsty, he dared not take it.
1:46:28|1:46:35|The scene cuts back and forth between singing Wang Duoyu and Xia Zhu waiting for rescue.
1:46:57|1:47:40|[Xia Zhu] stared blankly at his reflection in the puddle at his feet, his thoughts drifting aimlessly. As the rain gradually subsided and the appointed time drew nearer, [Xia Zhu] and [Mr. Jin] leaned back in their chairs, waiting for [Wang Duoyu]. [Mr. Jin] occasionally glanced at his watch, his expression growing more serious. [Xia Zhu] sat quietly on the side, but his eyes couldn't help but sneak glances towards the staircase. In a daze, he seemed to see [Wang Duoyu] approaching in a jumpsuit, carrying two pockets of cash, with the words "All wealth is scattered" written on the jumpsuit.
1:47:40|1:47:50|[Xia Zhu] looked at [Wang Duoyu] in the distance, tears almost falling from his eyes. However, when he focused, there was nothing at the staircase, everything just now was his illusion.
1:47:52|1:48:0|Mr. Jin reached out and picked up a watch from the table to wear it on his wrist.
1:48:2|1:48:18|[Xia Zhu] gave a helpless smile, the fat man pretending to be a kidnapper took the car keys and prepared to go downstairs. He had not taken a few steps when he saw a group of men in black sitting at the stairway.
1:48:52|1:49:22|[Wang Duoyu] was squatting at the stairway, hugging the money with his eyes closed and wailing. [Xia Zhu] couldn't help but shed tears as she looked at him. With a mournful face, [Wang Duoyu] lifted his head, opened his eyes, only to see [Mr. Jin] and [Xia Zhu] smiling at him from upstairs, while [Liu Jiannan] also walked away with a messy hairstyle.
1:49:41|1:49:54|The projector displayed a video of [Wang Duoyu] on the wall. The staff member operating the projector quickly realized the mistake, lowered their head, and changed the video.
1:50:5|1:50:13|[Wang Duoyu] put his fallen false teeth back in place.
1:50:38|1:51:27|[Wang Duoyu] and [Xia Zhu] turned their heads in surprise to look at Mr. Jin beside them. Mr. Jin also turned back to look at them, smiling and winking. Wang Duoyu and Xia Zhu gasped and quickly turned their heads back. As the sun set and the sky darkened, the title of the film "The Island" appeared on the screen again. The whole city looked particularly peaceful under the sunlight, with a bridge standing tall in the river. A blue sedan drove through different cities, taking away different beautiful sceneries. The sedan finally stopped in front of the charity association, where a group of reporters surrounded it. Wang Duoyu got out of the car and then went to the passenger seat to welcome his pregnant wife, [Xia Zhu].
1:52:15|1:52:26|[Wang Duoyu] looked at [Xia Zhu] for a long time without saying a word. He turned around, took off his sunglasses, and awkwardly said.
1:53:38|1:53:47|[Wang Duoyu] and [Xia Zhu] have been calculating accounts from day to night. The staff couldn't help but fall asleep on the sofa, but they haven't finished calculating yet.
