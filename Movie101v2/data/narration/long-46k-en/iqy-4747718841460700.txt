0:1:58|0:2:10|The scene starts at the entrance of the Shanghai Nursing School, where several female students are entering the campus one after another. The school is surrounded by lush trees, and students are sitting in groups on the lawn chatting.
0:2:17|0:2:33|The singing came from the corridor of the school dormitory. A girl sat on the railing singing, with three others standing on the corridor, swaying along with the music. They were all wearing nurse uniforms, their smiles radiating youthful vigor.
0:2:47|0:3:14|In the dormitory, several girls are playing and laughing. Two girls sit down, and the other three gather around. [Ma Feixia] is looking in the mirror on the bed, and the girls gather around.
0:3:41|0:3:59|The person who just spoke was the principal of the nursing school. After giving instructions, he gently closed the door, turned off the lights in the student dormitory, and left. It was a clear night with swaying tree shadows, and it was already late at night.
0:4:7|0:4:32|The protagonist [Jian Suhua] quietly walked into the dormitory room, sat on her bed. She sat with her knees together, opened her diary on her lap, uncapped her pen, and began writing in her diary.
0:4:43|0:4:48|The whole nursing school was in an uproar.
0:4:53|0:5:10|At this moment, the girls lying on the bed are all awake, some playing with their braids and contemplating their future. Tang Xiaofang, who is sleeping on the top bunk, tosses and turns in bed. She pushes her glasses up, leans over, and asks [Jian Suhua] sitting below.
0:5:14|0:5:16|[Jian Suhua] playfully winked.
0:5:24|0:5:29|Tang Xiaofang climbed up to the upper bunk and sat cross-legged facing [Jian Suhua].
0:5:36|0:5:40|[Jian Suhua] held her tightly. [Jian Suhua] smiled as she cupped Tang Xiaofang's face.
0:6:23|0:6:30|The scene shifts to a hospital, where two doctors and [Shen Haoru] walk out of a ward.
0:6:43|0:7:1|The old doctor nodded in satisfaction, and a nurse approached. The old doctor nodded to [Shen Haoru] as a sign of permission, and [Shen Haoru] quickly walked away with the nurse. The two doctors walked away while discussing their opinions of [Shen Haoru].
0:7:3|0:7:5|[Shen Haoru] answered the phone.
0:7:13|0:7:19|[Tang Xiaofang] paced back and forth in the corridor outside the principal's office, where the conversation between the principal and [Jian Suhua] could be heard.
0:8:7|0:8:9|The principal took out a stack of telegrams from the drawer.
0:8:34|0:8:36|[Jian Suhua] hesitated.
0:9:9|0:9:21|Standing outside the window, [Tang Xiaofang] pointed at herself vigorously, hinting to [Jian Suhua], who smiled.
0:9:40|0:9:47|Seventeen nurses. At this moment, [Jian Suhua] finally noticed [Gao Changping] in the office.
0:10:0|0:10:2|[Gao Changping] approaches [Jian Suhua].
0:10:16|0:10:25|The principal picked up the roster from the table. [Jian Suhua] saw the list and smiled happily.
0:10:58|0:11:6|[Jian Suhua] did not answer, and continued walking forward. They stopped at the doorstep.
0:11:20|0:11:27|Shen Haoru embraced [Jian Suhua], and the two of them ran into the corridor laughing. Shen Haoru closed the door of the corridor and was about to go upstairs.
0:11:28|0:11:50|[Jian Suhua] hugged him excitedly, and after he finished speaking, she shyly ran upstairs. [Jian Suhua] stopped in front of the door, while Shen Haoru continued running to the room upstairs. [Jian Suhua] was very puzzled, but Shen Haoru stood on the upper floor waving to [Jian Suhua], who followed him upstairs.
0:11:54|0:12:18|[Jian Suhua] stood at the door, looking around the well-furnished room as directed by Shen Haoru. Shen Haoru smiled proudly. With a serious expression, Shen Haoru approached and hugged him. [Jian Suhua] lowered her head, pushed Shen Haoru away, and walked to the window.
0:12:22|0:12:31|Shen Haoru ran downstairs to the room in sadness. [Jian Suhua] looked at her back, not knowing what to do.
0:12:32|0:12:47|[Jian Suhua] frowned and sat down at the table. She turned and walked towards the room downstairs. At that moment, Shen Haoru was sitting on the edge of the bed, dragging his forehead.
0:12:48|0:12:53|Seeing [Jian Suhua], [Shen Haoru] tugged at his clothes and said discontentedly.
0:13:14|0:13:22|[Jian Suhua] looked at [Shen Haoru] and slowly walked over to sit beside her.
0:13:27|0:13:29|[Shen Haoru] tightly held [Jian Suhua]'s hand.
0:14:4|0:14:23|[Jian Suhua] gently grabbed [Shen Haoru]'s clothes, pleading with her with her eyes. [Shen Haoru] avoided facing her, turning to the side. [Jian Suhua] smiled at [Shen Haoru] and gently touched her. [Shen Haoru] nodded helplessly.
0:14:28|0:14:52|The station mother is seeing off [Jian Suhua]. After listening to her mother's instructions, [Jian Suhua] embraces her mother. The station is crowded with people, and there are constant reminders to board the train. Hearing [Gao Changping]'s urging, [Jian Suhua] wipes away her tears.
0:15:1|0:15:13|[Jian Suhua] ran into Tang Xiaofang. [Jian Suhua] anxiously looked around.
0:15:18|0:15:22|[Jian Suhua] and Tang Xiaofang leaned out of the car window to bid farewell to their family.
0:15:24|0:15:38|Shen Haoru ran towards the train carrying a bouquet of flowers and a package for [Jian Suhua], but the train had already started moving. [Jian Suhua] and Tang Xiaofang waved to Shen Haoru as he ran alongside the moving train.
0:15:45|0:15:55|Shen Haoru wanted to hand the flowers to [Jian Suhua] through the car window, but accidentally dropped them on the ground. He quickly picked up the flowers and handed them, along with the package, to [Jian Suhua] through the car window.
0:16:0|0:16:13|Shen Haoru looked at Jian Suhua reluctantly as he continued to run alongside the train. He reached out towards the window, trying to hold hands with Jian Suhua again, but accidentally fell. By the time he got up, the train had already gone far away.
0:16:16|0:16:41|Shen Haoru stood with [Jian Suhua]'s mother. [Jian Suhua]'s mother looked at Shen Haoru with concern. Inside the train carriage, Tang Xiaofang was reading, with [Jian Suhua] sitting opposite her, holding the flowers brought by Shen Haoru and looking out the window with a serious expression.
0:16:43|0:16:48|At this moment, [Gao Changping] walked over to them with a smile.
0:16:56|0:17:0|[Gao Changping] sat down in the empty seat next to Tang Xiaofang.
0:17:14|0:17:37|The companions were full of expectations for the future, singing joyfully. Tang Xiaofang pointed to [Gao Changping], who was looking out the window, and the companions sang along.
0:17:48|0:17:50|[Jian Suhua] came to her senses and sang along with them.
0:18:27|0:18:45|The train arrived in the snowy north. [Jian Suhua] and Tang Xiaofang, dressed in heavy cotton coats, rode in a carriage with others to their residence. The two of them huddled closely together, looking around curiously.
0:18:47|0:19:15|Passengers and the person leading the cart were all wrapped in thick cotton coats. Three mule carts moved forward on the snowy path. The mule carts stopped in front of a single-story house. People got off the carts one after another with their luggage.
0:19:37|0:19:43|Pointing to the other side of the wasteland, where several flags stood on the empty ground, with distant mountains stretching out in the background.
0:20:5|0:20:9|[Jian Suhua] gently touched Tang Xiaofang, and the two of them started laughing.
0:20:11|0:20:27|At this moment, the screen shows a vast expanse of white snow. [Jian Suhua] and Tang Xiaofang excitedly run towards the work site registration office. The snow on the road is ankle-deep, and Tang Xiaofang, wearing a heavy cotton coat, walks unsteadily in front of [Jian Suhua] and accidentally falls down.
0:20:29|0:20:44|[Jian Suhua] smiled and approached, trying to help Tang Xiaofang up, but failed several times. In the end, she fell down herself. The two sat in the snow laughing, and [Jian Suhua] mischievously kicked the snow on the ground.
0:21:31|0:21:47|[Jian Suhua] smiled helplessly, while Tang Xiaofang looked a bit upset. [Jian Suhua] grabbed Tang Xiaofang's hand, shook her head at her, and both of them sighed together. The scene now shows the exterior of the medical station in the 102 construction site.
0:21:47|0:21:58|In front of the courtyard covered with snow, there are several withered trees, and the continuous hills surround the small courtyard of the medical station. [Jian Suhua] runs down from the hills carrying luggage.
0:21:59|0:22:15|Looking up, Jian Suhua saw a sign hanging on a dry wooden pole, indicating the 102 Work Area Medical Station and a red cross symbol. Despite being out of breath from rushing, Jian Suhua was very excited and quickly ran towards the front door of the medical station.
0:22:17|0:22:41|Walking into the medical station, [Jian Suhua] looked around curiously. There were some bloody gauze scattered on the floor and on the benches. Through the window, she could see bottles of medicine on the gift shelf. [Jian Suhua] walked inside. By chance, she saw Station Chief Mo and his lover kissing in front of the office desk.
0:22:42|0:22:56|[Jian Suhua] felt a bit embarrassed, turned his back, but couldn't help peeking curiously. He shook the bag in his hand, trying to get their attention. Innkeeper Mo warmly took the luggage.
0:23:8|0:23:17|The station master sat down on the bench next to [Jian Suhua], while Gu Huiying lowered her head and knitted. The station master noticed that his lover was a little angry, so he had to stand up.
0:23:37|0:23:54|Gu Huiying saw Manager Mo being so enthusiastic towards the beautiful [Jian Suhua] that she forcefully punched his waist. Manager Mo winced in pain, awkwardly trying to explain. The volunteer station staff Zhang Aliu walked in.
0:24:0|0:24:20|[Jian Suhua] warmly greeted him. [Jian Suhua] warmly held the hands that Lao Zhang was trying to avoid, and the two smiled at each other. At this moment, Gu Huiying signaled to Chief Mo, and the two walked into the examination room one after the other.
0:24:25|0:24:28|Innkeeper Mo caressed Jian Suhua's hand, and Jian Suhua smiled.
0:24:44|0:24:57|In the clinic, Jian Suhua is wiping the railing. The station master nods in agreement, looking a bit hesitant. He then tells Old Zhang to leave, and Old Zhang walks away.
0:25:14|0:25:19|[Jian Suhua] continued to wipe the railing as Mr. Mo pondered for a moment and said.
0:25:39|0:25:43|Jian Suhua was shocked by Hui Yingta.
0:26:17|0:26:40|The head of the village left, and [Jian Suhua] shook her head with worry. It was late at night, the surroundings were pitch black, with only a faint light coming from the small lamp above the medical station sign. The night wind was strong, causing the lamp to sway back and forth, while the dry branches around swayed in and out of sight in the flickering light.
0:26:40|0:26:48|Frost had formed on the edge of the window. At the medical station, only [Jian Suhua] was on duty, sitting by the window writing in her diary.
0:27:8|0:27:16|[Jian Suhua] was pondering when suddenly she heard the terrifying sound of wind. She hastily stood up from the chair, staring wide-eyed out the window.
0:27:21|0:27:42|The wind subsided slightly, and [Gao Changping] breathed a sigh of relief, then resumed writing in his diary. There was a noise outside the window. [Jian Suhua] was very scared, she looked outside and slowly backed away, accidentally bumping into the stove where water was boiling. Startled, she picked up the stove hook as a defensive weapon.
0:27:44|0:27:58|He bent down and cautiously walked towards the window. At this moment, the door behind him suddenly opened by itself. [Jian Suhua] looked towards the wooden door, but there was nothing there. He continued to bend down and walk towards the window, where a dark figure was moving.
0:28:2|0:28:26|The pair of shoes that were originally placed on the roof were blown down by the wind and hung on the eaves, swaying from side to side. [Jian Suhua] found it amusing, opened the window above, used the poker in his hand to hook the shoes down, and mischievously scolded the shoes with the poker. At this moment, a loud knocking on the door was heard.
0:28:30|0:28:41|Upon hearing that her friend had arrived, [Jian Suhua] quickly put down what she was holding and excitedly went to open the door. After [Jian Suhua] closed the door, Tang Xiaofang came in, took off her gloves and hat, and shook off the snow from her body.
0:28:53|0:29:0|They embraced each other excitedly, walked into the room arm in arm, Tang Xiaofang took off her cotton coat, and [Jian Suhua] spread out the quilt on the bed.
0:29:5|0:29:13|They embrace each other. Tang Xiaofang shakes her head.
0:29:20|0:29:34|[Jian Suhua] helped Tang Xiaofang onto the bed and wrapped the quilt around her. [Jian Suhua] moved a stool to the bedside and sat down. Tang Xiaofang pursed her lips.
0:29:39|0:29:44|Tang Xiaofang shook her head. Tang Xiaofang shook her head again.
0:29:50|0:29:53|[Jian Suhua] sat behind Tang Xiaofang, who yawned and leaned against the head of the bed.
0:30:49|0:31:12|[Jian Suhua] waited for an answer. She looked at Tang Xiaofang, who had already fallen asleep, and smiled as she pinched her nose. [Jian Suhua] got up to tuck Tang Xiaofang in, moved the stool back to the table, picked up the pen, and prepared to continue writing in her diary.
0:31:16|0:31:33|He suddenly remembered something, opened the drawer and took out a stack of letters, lost in thought. He wrote.
0:31:37|0:31:47|The scene then shifts to the hospital where Jian Suhua is located. She pushes open the door to the nurse's station and starts writing something in a notebook as she walks.
0:31:47|0:32:19|Ma Feixia took the handwriting from Shen Haoru's hand, and the two walked to the table. Shen Haoru flipped through it, Ma Feixia smiled at her. Upon hearing this, Shen Haoru's hand holding the letter twitched slightly. Ma Feixia chuckled softly, then turned and walked out of the nurse's station.
0:32:19|0:32:30|Shen Haoru saw him leave, hurriedly tore open the letter, took out the letter from [Jian Suhua], and read it carefully. He frowned and shook his head.
0:32:47|0:32:54|The scene shifts, [Jian Suhua] carries a tray filled with medical supplies to the medical station table and arranges them one by one.
0:32:57|0:33:16|Employee Lao Zhang walked over and handed a piece of gauze to [Jian Suhua]. [Jian Suhua] smiled and took it, putting the gauze into a jar. Then, [Jian Suhua] tidied up the shelves while Lao Zhang arranged the tables and chairs. The two of them then walked out of the inner room one after the other.
0:33:16|0:33:26|Several workers waiting for treatment are sitting outside. Jian Suhua and Gao Changping walk in from the door. Gao Changping walks to the desk, puts down the handbag, takes off the coat, and hangs it on the back of the chair.
0:33:56|0:34:4|A worker wearing a safety helmet walked in and placed his arm on the table, [Mayor Mo] began to feel his pulse.
0:34:4|0:34:18|[Gu Huiying] is applying medicine to the patient's waist. When changing the medicine, she inadvertently catches a glimpse of the papers in [Jian Suhua]'s hand, standing next to [Chief Mo] and saying something. [Gu Huiying] becomes entranced, forgetting that she is applying medicine, standing still in a daze.
0:34:22|0:34:46|[Gu Huiying] mistakenly placed the gauze on the patient's neck. [Mo the station chief] took out a pen to write a prescription, tore it off and handed it to the patient. It was only then that he looked up and recognized this fellow worker.
0:34:52|0:34:58|In the Chinese commentary, the village chief Mo threw away the prescription he just crumpled up. He then wrote a new prescription, tore it off, and handed it to the worker.
0:35:19|0:35:35|The worker with the prescription went to [Jian Suhua] for an injection, while patient number three, [Gao Changping], sat down. [Jian Suhua] took the prescription, looked at it, picked up the needle, disinfected it, and prepared to give the injection.
0:35:54|0:36:2|[Gu Huiying] is a little angry. After finishing the treatment, [Lu Hao] walks over, and [Gu Huiying] is giving injections to the workers.
0:36:5|0:36:12|After speaking, continue to give the workers injections and apply medicine. The workers grimaced in pain. [Lu Hao] returned to the kitchen.
0:36:18|0:36:20|[Gao Changping] turned and walked away.
0:36:24|0:36:26|[Jian Suhua] caught up.
0:36:43|0:36:47|[Jian Suhua] walked to the table to prepare the medicine, and Lu Hao also followed and sat down.
0:37:38|0:37:44|Lu Hao laughed and was about to leave when he accidentally bumped into Gu Huiying, who walked to the table with a displeased look on her face.
0:37:48|0:38:11|[Jian Suhua] and Tang Xiaofang are having a meal together. Tang Xiaofang takes out a small bottle and pours it into the soup. [Jian Suhua] is amused by Tang Xiaofang's troubled expression while drinking the soup.
0:38:14|0:38:43|Gu Huiying passed by, and [Jian Suhua] couldn't help but laugh at these words. Gu Huiying sat down next to Lao Zhang and started eating. [Jian Suhua] and Tang Xiaofang looked in Gu Huiying's direction, and Tang Xiaofang asked. Tang Xiaofang was not pleased to hear these words.
0:38:44|0:38:52|Tang Xiaofang angrily tapped the bowl. Gu Huiying finished speaking and also tapped the bowl forcefully.
0:39:6|0:39:31|After Tang Xiaofang finished speaking, she knocked again. [Jian Suhua] couldn't bear it, put down her chopsticks, got up and left. Tang Xiaofang and Gu Huiying also stood up. While Gu Huiying was busy serving rice, Tang Xiaofang took out the salt she carried with her, poured the whole bottle into her soup, stirred it a few times, and then ran out of the cafeteria.
0:39:31|0:39:33|Lao Zhang witnessed all this, but remained silent.
0:39:36|0:40:1|Gu Huiying came back and picked up the bowl of soup full of salt. After blowing on it, she took a sip and immediately spat it out. Lao Zhang was amused by this scene. Tang Xiaofang happily arrived at [Jian Suhua]'s residence with an empty salt shaker, only to see [Jian Suhua] covering her face and crying.
0:40:7|0:40:23|Tang Xiaofang put the bottle into her pocket. At this moment, [Gao Changping] arrived, knocked on the door, and saw [Jian Suhua] crying.
0:40:57|0:41:9|After speaking, Tang Xiaofang turned around to help [Jian Suhua] pack up, and [Jian Suhua] also made up her mind to pack with her. At this moment, [Gao Changping] quietly walked up behind them, handing things over to help.
0:41:18|0:41:22|Tang Xiaofang turned around, and [Jian Suhua] also came over.
0:41:34|0:41:39|[Jian Suhua] felt a little embarrassed and turned her head to walk away.
0:41:59|0:42:7|Upon hearing this, [Jian Suhua] sat down sadly. After saying this, [Gao Changping] placed the neatly packed suitcase by [Jian Suhua]'s feet.
0:42:28|0:42:31|[Jian Suhua] hesitated.
0:42:40|0:42:43|[Jian Suhua] stopped Tang Xiaofang from picking up the luggage.
0:43:0|0:43:6|Upon hearing this, Tang Xiaofang stuck out her tongue at [Jian Suhua], put down her luggage, and [Gao Changping] smiled.
0:43:40|0:43:50|At the party, workers were playing musical instruments, including drummers, flutists, violinists, and erhu players. A girl stood in front of the stage singing.
0:44:14|0:44:22|The dance hall was packed with people, everyone dancing to the music. [Jian Suhua], Tang Xiaofang, and [Gao Changping] were all present.
0:44:28|0:44:56|In the ballroom, there are people in ethnic costumes, in suits, and in work clothes. After a busy day, they are now relaxing and dancing. [Gao Changping] and [Jian Suhua] stand on the balcony of the ballroom, leaning on the railing and looking out at the construction site. [Gao Changping] turns to [Jian Suhua] and says.
0:45:25|0:45:43|After speaking, they turned around and looked again at the construction site that was taking shape. At this moment, Manager Mo walked towards the balcony. Manager Mo smiled and looked at [Jian Suhua].
0:45:55|0:46:13|[Jian Suhua] agreed and turned back to the ballroom, with Manager Mo quickly following. [Gao Changping] watched their backs and smiled. Just as he turned around, he heard a little girl's voice. [Gao Changping] walked over, picked up his daughter, and asked with a smile.
0:46:20|0:46:28|[Gao Changping] opened a dance hall and then left with his daughter. At this moment, [Jian Suhua] was dancing with Manager Mo.
0:46:55|0:47:11|After speaking, [Jian Suhua] smiled and ran off. Captain Mo took off his hat and stared blankly at [Jian Suhua]'s back. At that moment, on the screen, [Jian Suhua] was walking towards the construction site with a small medicine box slung diagonally across his body.
0:47:13|0:47:37|The driver was blown by the strong wind, standing on a small hill looking towards the construction site. Several small houses were scattered on the site, surrounded by construction equipment such as bulldozers, excavators, trucks, and small trains on tracks all working non-stop. People were busy at their positions.
0:47:38|0:47:59|Construction is in full swing, completely different from when Jian Suhua first arrived here. Jian Suhua is delighted to see this scene. At this moment, the sound of explosions comes from the distance. Thick smoke rolls down the hillside, and Jian Suhua hurries towards the construction site.
0:48:1|0:48:12|A car drove past him at that moment, splashing water all over the road. [Jian Suhua] quickly dodged to the side. He then turned around and flagged down a car to ask for directions.
0:48:22|0:48:40|[Jian Suhua] grabbed the car door and the car quickly headed towards the 102 district. Along the way were construction sites with countless steel bars and cement piled on the ground, and several large cranes were operating nervously. The car soon arrived at its destination.
0:48:40|0:48:45|[Jian Suhua] got off the car and excitedly ran towards the construction site, where he saw two people standing in a excavator.
0:48:47|0:49:3|[Gao Changping] leaned on the car window and talked with two people, [Jian Suhua] approached.
0:49:33|0:49:42|[Jian Suhua] walked towards the welding team, where the workers were busy next to the machines, with dust flying everywhere. [Jian Suhua] was about to ask one of the workers about the whereabouts of Lu Hao.
0:49:57|0:49:59|[Jian Suhua] walked towards the upwind.
0:50:6|0:50:8|The worker finished speaking and continued to turn the wheel on the machine.
0:50:26|0:50:29|[Jian Suhua] takes notes while speaking.
0:50:33|0:50:35|Qian Huanzhang raised his head and pointed upwards towards [Gao Changping].
0:50:38|0:50:49|[Jian Suhua] looked in the direction of Qian Huanzhang's finger, where there was a building under construction with only the framework erected. Lu Hao stood at the highest corner, watching what was happening next.
0:50:51|0:51:15|[Jian Suhua] pondered how to go up. Suddenly, he saw inside the building there were only crude stairs supported by scaffolding. He smiled, quickly climbed up the stairs. Halfway up, he stopped, leaning on the scaffolding to look down, then up again.
0:51:15|0:51:18|[Jian Suhua] smiled and continued to climb up with determination.
0:51:45|0:51:55|Director Gao, after hearing the worker's reminder, saw Jian Suhua on the top floor of the building. His brows furrowed with deep concern, he quickly jumped off the excavator and ran towards the direction of the building.
0:52:1|0:52:24|After a while, several workers ran over holding a fishing net. They spread the net out, trying to catch Jian Suhua. Jian Suhua, scared, covered her face and stood still, swaying back and forth, too afraid to move, not knowing what to do. Director Gao looked at her worriedly, while at this moment, Lu Hao noticed Jian Suhua.
0:52:24|0:52:30|Lu Hao quickly took off his gloves, removed the hook of the safety rope hanging on the bracket, and walked towards [Jian Suhua].
0:52:34|0:52:42|Director Gao furrowed his brow, looking very worried. Lu Hao slowly approached [Jian Suhua].
0:53:21|0:53:25|Lu Hao grabbed the basket of the crane and tried to help [Jian Suhua] up.
0:53:31|0:53:41|[Jian Suhua] had to be helped by Lu Hao to step into the basket of the crane. Lu Hao also jumped in and shouted at the crane operator.
0:53:42|0:53:49|The onlooker workers stared intently at Lu Hao and the brave girl. The crane basket slowly descended with the two of them.
0:53:52|0:54:7|As the basket approached the ground, a worker helped to hold onto the crane. At this moment, the onlookers gathered around. Lu Hao jumped down first, then helped Jian Suhua down. Gao Changping ran over, angrily questioning Jian Suhua.
0:54:39|0:55:6|[Jian Suhua] shouted at Lu Hao. The worker next to her shouted at [Gao Changping]. [Jian Suhua] drugged Lu Hao. The two warmly shook hands. By this time, [Gao Changping] had already resolved the dispute between the two workers. [Jian Suhua] ran over.
0:55:27|0:55:43|[Gao Changping] nodded. [Gao Changping] and [Jian Suhua] arrived at Hong Zhishou's house together. [Jian Suhua] took Hong Zhishou's temperature while he lay in bed, then looked at the thermometer and walked to the side. [Gao Changping] followed along.
0:55:47|0:55:55|[Jian Suhua] put away the thermometer. Gao Changping glanced out the window.
0:56:3|0:56:6|After speaking, [Jian Suhua] picked up the medicine box and walked towards the door.
0:56:10|0:56:32|Outside, the strong wind was blowing, making the dry trees sway from side to side and the ground covered in swirling sand and dust. [Jian Suhua] walked briskly towards the medical station. At that moment, Captain Mo was playing cards in the medical station.
0:56:43|0:56:59|Just a few days after arriving, [Jian Suhua] has already violated labor discipline by not reaching the duty station. The strong wind made the progress even more difficult. Inside the duty station, Captain Mo leisurely hummed a song while smoking a pipe.
0:57:9|0:57:17|He walked sadly to the window, about to leave. Huiying raised her hand and slapped Mo Zhen.
0:57:37|0:57:59|At this moment, [Jian Suhua] rushed in with a medical kit, looking anxious. [Jian Suhua] quickly picked up the medical kit and started organizing it.
0:58:11|0:58:14|[Jian Suhua] put on a raincoat and ran outside with Manager Mo.
0:58:17|0:58:39|Outside, a heavy rainstorm began, and Yiwu's car was driving in the midst of the fierce wind and rain. Chief Mo fell asleep in the car, with [Jian Suhua] and Director Gao also sitting inside. Hong Zhishou lay on the side. Suddenly, the car shook violently and stopped. Director Gao and [Jian Suhua] got off to check the situation, only to find that the car's wheel was stuck in the mud.
0:58:49|0:58:56|Director Gao walked to the wheel of the car below the line, squatted down, and used his hands to clear away the mud next to the car.
0:59:0|0:59:6|The wheels are turning, but the car is still not moving. Director Gao takes off his coat and throws himself in front of the wheels.
0:59:22|0:59:31|The car started slowly, [Jian Suhua] picked up Director Gao's coat and handed it to him, and then they both got on the car.
0:59:41|0:59:45|The scene shifts, Jian Suhua is sleeping in the room.
0:59:52|1:0:7|[Jian Suhua] quietly approached, took the paper away, gently pinched Tang Xiaofang's nose, and patted her face. Seeing that Tang Xiaofang still did not wake up, [Jian Suhua] walked to the table, took off her raincoat and jacket, and draped them over the chair.
1:0:12|1:0:38|He yawned and stretched lazily. Sitting down, he took out a cup and poured water from the thermos to drink. After a busy day, [Jian Suhua] was very tired. He took a sip of water, holding the cup, pondering something.
1:0:44|1:0:56|Then, he took out a piece of paper and a pen, and began writing a letter to Shen Haoru.
1:1:52|1:1:56|[Gu Huiying] pushed the door open and [Jian Suhua] turned around to ask.
1:2:51|1:3:10|[Jian Suhua] walked to the table, picked up Shen Haoru's photo and the letter just written, and handed them to [Gu Huiying] with a smile. [Gu Huiying] took the letter and photo, and looked at them. His hands trembled slightly, he raised his eyes in embarrassment, and looked at [Jian Suhua].
1:3:17|1:3:29|She moved her lips as if to say something. She put down the letter, held [Jian Suhua]'s hand and said. She covered her face and started crying.
1:3:30|1:3:40|[Gu Huiying] leaned her head on [Jian Suhua]'s shoulder. Upon waking up, Tang Xiaofang saw this and tears welled up in her eyes. Suddenly, [Gu Huiying] turned around and left.
1:3:43|1:3:47|[Jian Suhua] caught up and held [Gu Huiying]'s hand, saying.
1:3:53|1:3:58|[Gu Huiying] was very surprised to hear this news and quickly ran away. At this moment,
1:4:8|1:4:31|The scene shows [Jian Suhua] preparing medicine. He picks up a medicine bottle and places it on a small table next to the window with something written on it. [Gao Changping] enters from outside.
1:4:41|1:4:50|He closed the door and walked to [Jian Suhua]'s side, playing with the things on the table.
1:4:59|1:5:4|[Jian Suhua] watched as [Gao Changping] continued to write something with his head down, while [Gao Changping] kept talking.
1:5:26|1:5:28|[Gao Changping] closes the wooden board again.
1:5:52|1:5:55|[Gu Huiying] stood at the door, hands folded, looking coldly at [Gao Changping].
1:6:1|1:6:8|[Gu Huiying] shook her head, [Gu Huiying] finished speaking and left crying, [Jian Suhua] said to [Gao Changping].
1:6:34|1:6:48|[Jian Suhua] stepped forward to comfort [Gu Huiying]. He helped [Gu Huiying] sit down on a chair. [Jian Suhua] looked up and said to Chief Mo.
1:7:6|1:7:8|In anger, Manager Mo paces back and forth.
1:7:15|1:7:19|At this moment, Lao Zhang walked up to Captain Mo with a medicine box.
1:7:23|1:7:30|[Jian Suhua] and [Gao Changping] each carried a medicine box on their backs, hand in hand, walking towards the door.
1:7:40|1:8:1|Manager Mo took the medicine box from Old Zhang's hand and caught up. On the construction site, [Jian Suhua], [Gu Huiying], and Manager Mo were earnestly serving the workers. At the end of the day, as they walked back together, [Jian Suhua] and [Gu Huiying] were smiling happily.
1:8:3|1:8:10|The village chief finished speaking and walked away, followed by [Gu Huiying]. [Jian Suhua] walked unhappily and arrived at [Gao Changping]'s doorstep.
1:8:37|1:8:42|The daughter noticed [Jian Suhua] standing outside the door.
1:9:42|1:9:45|At this moment, [Gao Changping] walked in.
1:10:0|1:10:2|He then placed his daughter on the bed.
1:10:4|1:10:30|The girl was a little upset, [Jian Suhua] grabbed the deer's arm and asked, [Jian Suhua] helped the girl lie down on the bed, and he sang while patting the girl's arm.
1:11:15|1:11:19|[Gao Changping] stood at the door and heard [Jian Suhua]'s singing, feeling deeply moved.
1:11:40|1:11:55|The girl fell asleep, and [Jian Suhua] covered her with a blanket. She smiled at first, remembering the girl's words just now, feeling uneasy. She stood up gently, wanting to go out.
1:12:8|1:12:12|[Jian Suhua] left after saying that.
1:12:27|1:12:31|[Jian Suhua] walked to the window, took off her coat, and draped it over the chair.
1:12:35|1:12:40|[Jian Suhua] turned on the bedside lamp and sat down on the bed.
1:12:44|1:12:53|He covered himself with a blanket, sat down with his knees bent, touched his chin, unsure of what to do. He picked up the diary.
1:13:3|1:13:11|[Jian Suhua] flipped through the diary she had been keeping, already filled with entries for more than half of it. She picked up her pen and began to write.
1:14:37|1:14:48|At this moment, a train roared past on the screen. Shen Haoru decided to go find [Jian Suhua]. He sat on the train, deep in thought.
1:15:18|1:15:27|Hearing the broadcast singing loudly from the horn, a worker shouted. Upon hearing the shout, the workers all ran towards the construction site, each busy with their own work.
1:15:45|1:15:58|The vehicle continued to drive forward, with strong winds stirring up dust, as if covering the construction site with a layer of sand, making it impossible to see anything clearly. [Mo Zhangzhang] paced back and forth in the medical station, holding a smoking pipe and a medicine box.
1:16:4|1:16:15|[Jian Suhua], Gu Huiying, and Lao Zhang are getting ready to go to the construction site. Mo Zhanzhang walks up to [Jian Suhua] and Gu Huiying.
1:16:27|1:16:52|After speaking, Manager Mo hurried back to the office to look for the earpiece, but couldn't find it after searching for a long time. Manager Mo walked up to Old Zhang and said. Manager Mo suddenly noticed the earpiece hanging around his neck. The four were about to set off when they ran into Shen Haoru. [Jian Suhua] rushed up and hugged Shen Haoru, who looked at him happily.
1:16:55|1:17:5|[Jian Suhua] suddenly remembered the colleague behind her, so she pulled Shen Haoru to introduce everyone. The two walked in front of everyone.
1:17:14|1:17:16|[Jian Suhua] speaks to Shen Haoru.
1:17:29|1:17:49|[Jian Suhua] smiled and nodded at Director Mo, and they walked towards the construction site together. An injured worker approached [Jian Suhua], who quickly searched for the first aid kit to treat the worker. The strong wind continued to howl, with Shen Haoru standing by, burying his head into his collar.
1:17:52|1:18:2|He looked around in a panic, searching for a shelter from the wind.
1:18:20|1:18:23|He found Shen Haoru taking shelter next to a building.
1:18:30|1:18:42|[Jian Suhua] pulled Shen Haoru out. At this moment, Qian Huanzhang was struggling to turn the wheel of the machine. The wind was too strong, he couldn't stand steadily and accidentally fell down.
1:19:0|1:19:18|[Gao Changping] entered the room with a flashlight to inspect. Inside, the room was filled with sacks of cement. [Gao Changping] gave instructions to the workers beside him. After speaking, he started to help move the cement. [Gao Changping] took the cement bag from the worker's hand.
1:19:25|1:19:35|In the medical station at the construction site, everyone is busy. Shen Haoru helps Qian Huanzhang bandage his forehead wound.
1:20:7|1:20:18|Shen Haoru left angrily. [Jian Suhua] saw this and followed him out, while Gu Huiying continued to bandage Qian Huanzhang.
1:20:22|1:20:33|The two returned to the medical station, and Shen Haoru sat down on a chair. [Jian Suhua] walked to her dormitory and said to Shen Haoru.
1:20:48|1:20:58|[Jian Suhua] puts down the medicine box, takes off her coat, and speaks while pouring water. Shen Haoru takes off his coat, removes his scarf, and looks at [Jian Suhua].
1:21:5|1:21:8|[Jian Suhua] looked at Shen Haoru gently and said.
1:21:9|1:21:17|Shen Haoru slowly approached [Jian Suhua], and the shadows of the two were clearly reflected on the wall. Shen Haoru embraced [Jian Suhua].
1:21:29|1:21:32|[Jian Suhua] slowly leaned her head on his shoulder.
1:21:47|1:22:2|[Jian Suhua] looked at Shen Haoru affectionately, but Shen Haoru turned away discontentedly and pushed [Jian Suhua] away. Shen Haoru walked to the wall, took out a few letters from his clothes, and turned to [Jian Suhua].
1:22:22|1:22:26|[Jian Suhua] walked up to Shen Haoru.
1:22:41|1:22:45|[Jian Suhua] holds Shen Haoru's hand.
1:23:3|1:23:8|[Jian Suhua] sat down next to Shen Haoru and continued speaking.
1:23:27|1:23:32|Upon hearing this, Shen Haoru was very excited, he looked at [Jian Suhua] and said.
1:23:51|1:24:0|Shen Haoru walked to the side, put away the letter, and turned back to [Jian Suhua].
1:24:25|1:24:27|Shen Haoru forcefully grabs [Jian Suhua].
1:24:33|1:24:54|[Jian Suhua] saw Shen Haoru's actions and felt extremely sad. She held back her tears and ran out. Shen Haoru wanted to catch up, but heard a loud slamming of the door. Shen Haoru lowered his head, unsure of what to do. [Jian Suhua] had a serious expression, walking alone in the strong wind.
1:24:54|1:25:0|He leaned against the tree by the road, shaking his head helplessly. Then he let out a soft sigh and started crying while leaning on the tree.
1:25:4|1:25:29|Shen Haoru, dressed in hat and coat, sat on the stool angrily thinking. Suddenly, he picked up his luggage and left quickly. [Jian Suhua] leaned against a tree absentmindedly and happened to see Shen Haoru leaving with his luggage.
1:25:30|1:25:46|He looked at Shen Haoru's retreating figure, shouted excitedly, and Shen Haoru slowed down his pace after hearing the shout, glanced at [Jian Suhua], and walked away.
1:26:26|1:26:28|Shen Haoru took out two train tickets.
1:27:7|1:27:21|Upon hearing Shen Haoru's words, [Jian Suhua] was heartbroken and ran away with tears in her eyes. Watching [Jian Suhua] walk away, Shen Haoru took off his gloves, took out the letter written by [Jian Suhua] earlier, and tore it to pieces.
1:27:26|1:27:53|Shen Haoru opened his hand, and the pieces of the letter were instantly blown away by the wind. Shen Haoru picked up his luggage and left decisively. The wind continued unabated, and the sky was overcast. [Jian Suhua] returned to the room and lay on the pillow, crying in pain.
1:28:0|1:28:19|Outside the window, lightning flashed and thundered, and suddenly a torrential rain started pouring down. [Jian Suhua] heard the thunder and stood up abruptly, thinking of the workers at the construction site and her busy colleagues at the volunteer station. Feeling a bit dizzy, [Jian Suhua] steadied herself, wiped away her tears, and ran out the door.
1:28:27|1:28:40|Workers on the construction site ran into the house to take shelter from the rain. The thunder and heavy rain did not stop [Jian Suhua]'s footsteps. He arrived at the construction site, where wooden boxes were blown everywhere.
1:28:43|1:29:3|The sign at the construction site was blown down, and the warehouse filled with cement started leaking. [Gao Changping] looked at the leaking warehouse and shouted loudly. Upon hearing the shout, [Jian Suhua] hurried towards the warehouse. [Gao Changping] ran and shouted, and Lu Hao also rushed over.
1:29:7|1:29:23|Workers didn't care about the heavy rain and ran out with their tools. [Gao Changping] ran up to the roof of the warehouse along the ladder, and Lu Hao also climbed up with a hemp rope on his back. The pouring rain made Lu Hao unable to open his eyes, and he accidentally fell off the ladder.
1:29:23|1:29:31|[Jian Suhua] rushed over and saw Lu Hao lying on the ground, quickly approaching to check on him. She helped Lu Hao up and vigorously shook his body in an attempt to wake him up.
1:29:43|1:29:57|[Gao Changping] saw the two of them in trouble. Ignoring his own injuries, Lu Hao, with the help of another worker, carried a rope and climbed onto the roof.
1:29:59|1:30:15|He handed the hemp rope to [Gao Changping], and many workers next to the warehouse grabbed the rope. [Gao Changping], Lu Hao, and other workers together reinforced the leaking corner of the warehouse. The heavy rain poured down, thunder rumbling, and everyone's clothes were soaked through.
1:30:17|1:30:40|Ignoring the heavy rain and the cold, they finally pulled down the corner of the warehouse that was blown up by the wind, protecting the cement inside. Afterwards, some workers moved the cement, some reinforced the warehouse. The water had already risen above their ankles, but not a single person stopped. [Jian Suhua] brought a wooden board.
1:30:45|1:31:13|[Jian Suhua] quickly walked away to fetch the wooden planks. He reached the pile of wooden planks, struggled to pick one up, and moved forward. After a few steps, he ran out of strength, but he still persisted. After a few more steps, [Jian Suhua] collapsed in the pouring rain.
1:31:19|1:31:42|The scene shifts to a hospital room, with Jian Suhua's right face covered in gauze. Gao Changping, Lu Hao, Mo Zhangzhang, Gu Huiying, and others anxiously wait by the bed. Jian Suhua slowly opens her eyes and weakly asks the people beside her.
1:31:49|1:32:7|The scene shifts, Tang Xiaofang and [Gao Changping] walk down the hospital corridor. [Gao Changping] is holding a bouquet of flowers, while Tang Xiaofang is wearing a mask. They walk together towards [Jian Suhua]'s ward.
1:32:12|1:32:22|Tang Xiaofang smiled, she took the flowers from [Gao Changping]'s hand and gently pushed open the door of the ward. Tang Xiaofang nodded at [Gao Changping] and walked in, while [Gao Changping] left.
1:32:24|1:32:39|Tang Xiaofang closed the door and walked carefully towards the bed. On the sickbed, [Jian Suhua] weakly leaned against the headboard, with a similar bouquet of flowers placed beside her. Tang Xiaofang handed the flowers to [Jian Suhua], who took them and smiled happily.
1:32:49|1:33:14|[Jian Suhua] sat up straight, holding the bouquet of flowers as she looked out the window. Snowflakes were falling outside, landing on the branches. The camera then panned to show the trees outside covered in blossoms. [Jian Suhua] held a half-eaten fruit in one hand and was writing in her diary with the other. Tang Xiaofang walked in carrying medicine.
1:33:14|1:33:24|[Jian Suhua] finished her drink and placed it on the table. Tang Xiaofang sat down. At this moment, [Gu Huiying] and Director Mo walked in.
1:34:27|1:34:29|Gu Huiying smiled apologetically.
1:34:49|1:35:1|At this moment, the screen shows a completed factory building, with a tall chimney emitting smoke in one corner. A banner is hung on the pillar of the factory gate, with words written on it.
1:35:10|1:35:19|[Gao Changping] and [Jian Suhua] walked together to the bustling factory gate, looking up at the banners. [Jian Suhua] sighed.
1:36:58|1:37:1|After speaking, the two walked side by side.
1:37:16|1:37:38|The scene shifts, [Gao Changping] and the workers are bidding farewell. Tang Xiaofang looks back, still not seeing [Jian Suhua]. [Gao Changping] says regretfully.
1:37:47|1:38:5|People got on the car one after another, and those seeing them off kept waving goodbye. As the car started moving, at this moment, [Jian Suhua] hurriedly ran over here, anxiously searching for the figure of [Gao Changping].
1:38:9|1:38:36|[Jian Suhua] pushed through the crowd and called out to [Gao Changping]. The car stopped, and [Gao Changping] jumped out and ran towards [Jian Suhua]. The two of them excitedly clasped hands, with [Jian Suhua] explaining. [Gao Changping] smiled and asked [Jian Suhua]. [Jian Suhua] looked up.
1:38:38|1:38:44|[Jian Suhua] handed a letter to [Gao Changping]. Just as [Gao Changping] was about to open it, [Jian Suhua] shyly stopped him.
1:38:51|1:39:5|[Gao Changping]'s daughter shouted from the car. [Jian Suhua] walked over. [Jian Suhua] took off her scarf. [Gao Changping] nodded and got into the car.
1:39:8|1:39:23|[Gao Changping] tightly held [Jian Suhua]'s hand as the car started moving. [Jian Suhua] waved goodbye while running, and sitting in the car, [Gao Changping] opened [Jian Suhua]'s letter. He smiled happily as he read the four words on the letter: "I will definitely come."
1:39:23|1:39:28|[Gao Changping] excitedly waved his hat in farewell, while [Jian Suhua] waved her scarf to bid farewell to [Gao Changping].
