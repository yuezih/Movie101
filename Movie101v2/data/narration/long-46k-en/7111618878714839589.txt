0:2:2|0:2:9|The ten-year agreement has passed in a flash, and now [Wu Xie] stands in front of the bronze door holding the tomb-raiding notes filled with various ancient tomb information.
0:2:9|0:2:20|Although the Bronze Gate is famous in the tomb-robbing world, just by looking at the fresh wounds on [Wu Xie] and Wang [Fatty]'s faces, and their exhausted appearance, it is clear that standing in front of the gate is not an easy task.
0:2:20|0:2:39|[Wu Xie] confirmed that the bronze door in front of him was the entrance to the tomb. Understanding this, Wang [Fatty] took out the Kylin seal and, following the instructions in the book, inserted it into the mechanism at the base of the giant stone. The moment the seal touched the mechanism, the bronze door, which had been lifeless just a moment ago, began to move as if it had been electrified.
0:2:39|0:2:49|As the gears carved with exquisite patterns on both sides of the gate kept turning, the gate slowly opened, and [Wu Xie] tried hard to see the world behind the gate, but the incoming golden light made it impossible for him to open his eyes.
0:2:49|0:3:4|At this moment, a foot stepped through the bronze door. Wu Xie and Wang [Fatty] in front of the door endured the glaring light, squinting to see a man walking out slowly behind the door. He was dressed in a sweater, with a beautiful and stern appearance, and this man was none other than the leader of the guardian spirit clan, Zhang Qiling.
0:4:20|0:4:30|[Zeng Xiaoxian] seemed to possess a supernatural power. With a gentle burp, he sent the two gunmen flying into the woods. At that moment, a beam of light descended from the sky and landed on [Zeng Xiaoxian].
0:5:24|0:5:30|Accompanied by Zhang Wei's cross-talk, Lu Ziqiao and the others who were having breakfast looked at him speechlessly.
0:5:32|0:5:59|You have become the protagonist of The Lost Tomb. [Xeng Xiaoxian] nodded smugly. The rest of the Love Apartment group are all loyal fans of The Lost Tomb, and they naturally can't accept that [Xeng Xiaoxian] is the protagonist. After a bout of nausea, [Xeng Xiaoxian] also talked about the reason why he reads The Lost Tomb. If it weren't for your "Moon, My Heart" being changed to The Lost Tomb late-night radio drama, I wouldn't have read this kind of trash novel. Lu Ziqiao suddenly changed the topic and asked,
0:5:59|0:6:8|When it comes to [Hu Yifei], [Xiao Xian] instantly recalls the awkward moment when Nolan hugged her and was bumped by Yifei. [Xiao Xian] immediately shrunk back.
0:6:39|0:6:47|Coincidentally, [Hu Yifei] walked in from the balcony at this moment, but [Zeng Xiaoxian] clearly no longer believed in himself.
0:6:54|0:6:57|Before [Zeng Xiaoxian] could finish speaking, he immediately shut his mouth upon seeing [Hu Yifei].
0:7:57|0:8:13|As he spoke, [Xiao Xian]â€™s eyes began to moisten. After taking a sip of the drink beside him, he continued to speak to the few listeners.
0:10:2|0:10:19|[Xiao Xian] Although looking puzzled, upon seeing [Hu Yifei]'s number, he still entered the elevator to keep the appointment. At this moment, a strange thing happened - [Xiao Xian] suddenly noticed that all the floor buttons in the elevator had turned into the words "celebration". It seemed like this elevator only had one destination. Feeling puzzled, he randomly pressed one button.
0:10:19|0:10:21|At this moment, a voice prompt is heard from the elevator.
0:10:28|0:10:54|The elevator unexpectedly ascended at an extremely fast speed, catching [Xiao Xian] off guard as he fell to the ground. He struggled to get up and shouted to Xiaoyang that he had already adapted. Before he could finish his sentence, the lights in the elevator suddenly changed and the speed of ascent multiplied exponentially, reaching the height of 500 floors in the blink of an eye. Inside the elevator, [Xiao Xian] was knocked over, legs up in the air. After a moment, the elevator doors slowly opened, and [Zhang Wei] looked at the tumbling [Xiao Xian] and said, "Teacher Zeng, why are you just arriving? Quickly call the police."
0:11:0|0:11:24|[Lu Ziqiao] looked at the casually dressed [Xeng Xiaoxian] and said, bewildered, [Xeng Xiaoxian] was pulled out of the elevator by [Zhang Wei] and [Lu Ziqiao] to the high-tech lobby. At this moment, the celebration event officially began, welcome to the protagonist's halo upgrade celebration, the protagonist's halo is really something.
0:11:26|0:11:39|I must be dreaming, right? The still-dazed [Zeng Xiaoxian] was immediately captivated by the elegant [Tang Youyou], [Chen Meijia], and [Hu Yifei] descending the stairs. Each of the three, dressed to the nines, exuded charm and beauty, with [Hu Yifei] trailing behind, causing [Zeng Xiaoxian] to stare intently.
0:12:1|0:12:14|Years of arduous adventures have drained the energy of their protagonist halo, and today the adventure is about to restart. The brave and fearless trio of tomb raiders will face a whole new protagonist halo.
0:12:14|0:12:27|0plus' new generation protagonist aura has been fully upgraded, with a more powerful processor and longer-lasting energy. The top ten functions will escort your exciting adventures, everyone is life.
0:12:32|0:12:49|After the advertisement for the protagonist's halo finished, the group couldn't wait to enter the venue. Security guards were scanning everyone entering with the protagonist's halo detector. Different protagonists would display different levels, and each of them, including [Lu Ziqiao], had a level of D, until the confident [Zeng Xiaoxian] arrived.
0:13:43|0:13:56|[Zeng Xiaoxian] reluctantly took the briefcase containing the pirated protagonist halo. At that moment, the [Wu Xie] trio emerged with the screams of fans.
0:14:10|0:14:17|[The character who wanted to take a photo, [Xeng Xiaoxian], suddenly saw something.]
0:14:46|0:14:57|[Wu Xie], [Lu Ziqiao], and [Zhang Wei] bid farewell to the enthusiastic [Chen Meijia] and [Zhang Wei], and arrived at a secluded corner. They couldn't wait to open the suitcase. Inside, they found a plastic toy ring resting quietly.
0:14:57|0:15:4|[Wu Xie] picked up the ring and pulled hard, causing it to glow faintly like a glow stick. [Wu Xie] looked at it in surprise and said.
0:15:12|0:15:24|Later, [Wu Xie] followed the instructions in the box and installed the components before putting it on his head. A circle of flashing neon lights was tied to the model's ring, making it look very childish when placed there.
0:15:29|0:15:46|At this moment, [Zhang Qiling] also looked at [Wu Xie] and nodded seriously. The three of them, who were clueless about high technology, walked into the elevator with toy hula hoops, thinking they looked cool. This ridiculous scene was quietly observed by [Xeng Xiaoxian] and his group. After the elevator doors closed completely for [Wu Xie] and his friends,
0:15:46|0:15:49|Even the die-hard fan [Zhang Wei] couldn't bear to watch and said,
0:15:58|0:16:15|Encouraged by everyone, [Xiao Xian] cautiously opened the genuine suitcase he had dropped, and in the moment he appeared in the halo with everyone, his heartbeat seemed to fluctuate with the others. Everyone was attracted by the halo in front of them, and after a moment, [Zhang Wei] saw the instructions on the box.
0:16:15|0:16:46|Surprisingly, there was still an instruction manual. Just as the group was about to read the manual, the halo in the village suddenly rose to tens of meters high on the top of the grand hall. In the next second, a huge halo burst out from the faintly glowing halo, emitting an earth-shattering amount of energy. The massive halo emitted an incredibly dazzling light, illuminating every corner of the grand hall. Following that, the protagonist's halo injected energy into the bodies of the six individuals and left marks on the back of their necks. At this moment, Lu Ziqiao exclaimed in amazement, "The model is much better than the genuine product, it doesn't make sense."
0:17:23|0:17:41|Several people happily entered the elevator and left the lobby. When the elevator door opened again, they found themselves in the world of "The Lost Tomb". As they walked out of the hall with anticipation, they were shocked by the scene before them. In this dim world of "The Lost Tomb", there was a chilling and terrifying atmosphere lingering in the air.
0:17:41|0:17:53|Here gather elite tomb raiders from around the world, all armed and looking fierce, while the six members of the Ai Qin Apartment are still dressed in Tang Dynasty suits and long skirts, standing out from the tomb raiders here.
0:17:53|0:18:9|Passing by tomb raiders saw them with eyes like evil wolves seeing sheep, as if they were about to devour them in the next second. Just then, the broadcast suddenly sounded, followed by the lights of various vendors along the way also turning on, instantly turning the lifeless street into a brightly lit one.
0:18:9|0:18:23|The variety of businesses here is rich, ranging from food and entertainment to arms dealers and red-light districts, keeping visitors busy. On the other side, [Wu Xie] and Fatty returned to the ancestral home after walking the dog in the morning, but the old butler hurriedly said to [Wu Xie].
0:19:5|0:19:8|Fatty Wang saw the situation and said to [Wu Xie].
0:19:10|0:19:21|Er Ye heard the movement behind him, slowly stood up and faced the two people. Surprisingly, Er Ye was holding a bowl of noodles. The heavy breathing just now was only because the noodles were too spicy.
0:20:52|0:20:54|Fatty took the business card and said.
0:21:8|0:21:18|Huang Heihong, accompanied by bodyguards, walked through the crowd with a smile, passing between [Wu Xie] and Fatty. After the pedestrians left, [Wu Xie] and Fatty discussed Huang Heihong's conspiracy.
0:22:7|0:22:20|[Wu Xie] closed his eyes and began to meditate. After a moment, the pirated protagonist halo appeared in his mind. However, that pirated protagonist halo was just a model, unable to withstand [Wu Xie]'s powerful mental strength.
0:22:20|0:22:29|From the moment the spiritual power was injected, the protagonist's aura of piracy instantly collapsed, and [Wu Xie] began to suffer even more due to the massive damage to his spiritual power.
0:22:34|0:22:55|As soon as Fatty finished speaking, [Wu Xie] rolled his eyes and fainted. After hearing Zhang Wei's words, everyone suddenly realized and all cast their blaming eyes on [Xiao Xian] at the same time.
0:23:48|0:24:3|In the "Apartment of Love", although Hu Yifei and the others are not skilled in martial arts, they are quite adept at escaping, disappearing in the bustling city in the blink of an eye. [Zhang Qiling] held a long knife, carefully searching in the busy market. The few who clearly stood out with their attire that didn't fit in here seemed to be invisible.
0:24:3|0:24:14|[Zhang Qiling] searched all the way to the red light district, but still did not find the few people. What she never expected was that [Xeng Xiaoxian] was in the display case behind her, dancing a sexy pole dance with a scantily clad beauty.
0:24:14|0:24:26|[Xiao Xian] looked at [Zhang Qiling], who was close at hand, not only did not panic, but also smiled and tapped on the glass to make a funny face. But the next second, [Zhang Qiling] suddenly turned around, and [Xiao Xian], who had nowhere to escape, was grabbed and pressed against the table.
0:24:49|0:24:58|[Zhang Qiling] pushed [Xeng Xiaoxian] to the ground, then swiftly aimed a fatal blow, but surprisingly, [Hu Yifei] suddenly appeared and caught the blade.
0:25:13|0:25:26|Hu Yifei dodged the attack as the blade was drawn towards her. However, her movement was restricted by her long skirt when she tried to counterattack. Seizing the opportunity, Zhang Qiling punched her, sending her back several meters.
0:25:28|0:25:40|Furious and explosive [Hu Yifei] cleanly tears off the long skirt along the thigh, leaving [Zeng Xiaoxian] and [Zhang Wei] trembling in the corner like a mystery, [Hu Yifei] gives them a look to let them leave first.
0:25:40|0:25:56|After [Xiao Xian] left, a showdown between the top fighters from "Love Apartment" and "The Lost Tomb" was about to begin. [Zhang Qiling] took the lead and swung his sword towards [Hu Yifei]. Without the constraint of a long skirt this time, [Hu Yifei] fought back fiercely, kicking away the blade and following up with a shadowless kick right into [Zhang Qiling]'s chest.
0:25:57|0:26:3|[Zhang Qiling], who quickly adjusted himself, swung his knife towards [Hu Yifei] again, but unexpectedly, the narrow space caused the long knife to get stuck between the stairs.
0:26:3|0:26:12|[Hu Yifei] seized the opportunity and launched a series of heavy punches towards [Zhang Qiling]. However, [Hu Yifei] was ultimately a woman, so even such attacks only scratched the surface of [Zhang Qiling].
0:26:12|0:26:26|On the other hand, [Hu Yifei] retreated all the way and was forced into a small room. [Hu Yifei] cleverly used the refrigerator door to block the blades that were swung at her twice. With nowhere to go, she grabbed an apple nearby and threw it at [Zhang Qiling]. But how could this small apple stop [Zhang Qiling]?
0:26:27|0:26:40|Only to see him raise his knife and the flying apple instantly cut into two halves. [Zhang Qiling] seemed to be playing a fruit-cutting game, slicing the thrown fruits one by one. After all the fruits were thrown, [Hu Yifei] had a sudden inspiration and moved out of the window next to her to the roof.
0:26:40|0:26:53|Zhang Qiling followed closely behind, taking a giant leap towards the roof. However, before he could steady himself, he was sent flying several meters by a powerful strike from [Hu Yifei]. Smarting from the blow, Zhang Qiling no longer held back, and after a brief moment of eye contact, both of them leaped up simultaneously, launching full-force attacks at each other.
0:26:55|0:26:57|Ziqiao has disguised himself as a recruiter.
0:27:14|0:27:28|As soon as the words fell, the wall behind everyone collapsed in an instant. After the smoke cleared, [Hu Yifei] was lying on the ground with injuries all over her body. The next second, [Zhang Qiling] walked towards her with a steel knife in his hand, without saying a word, and raised the knife to strike at [Hu Yifei].
0:27:42|0:27:51|Zhang Qiling swung his knife again, but this time he was intercepted by [Chen Meijia]. He swung his knife again, only to be intercepted by [Zhang Wei].
0:28:34|0:28:39|Shortly after, Zhang Qiling informed the others about Wu Xie being hospitalized due to brain overload and falling into a coma.
0:28:39|0:28:53|Meanwhile, [Wu Xie] lying on the hospital bed still showed no signs of waking up. His good friend Fatty paced anxiously outside the ward. Just then, Huang Heihong, who had received the news, arrived outside the ward with four bodyguards, carrying flowers and nutritional supplements.
0:28:54|0:28:57|Wang [Fatty] knew that his intentions were impure, so he stepped forward to stop him.
0:29:40|0:29:45|On the TV screen, Er Kang was seen vigorously shaking Zi Wei.
0:29:49|0:29:51|Soon after, [Hu Yifei] and [Tang Youyou] walked into the hospital room.
0:31:37|0:31:42|Wu Xie, who has not fully recovered his memory, believes in the words of yellow, black, and red without any doubt.
0:33:10|0:33:15|Xiao Xian's inspiring words not only resonated with the passersby, but also received applause from those who were not directly involved.
0:33:19|0:33:25|The whole crowd at the scene cheered for [Xiao Xian] without exception, even [Zhang Qiling] reluctantly agreed after hearing it.
0:33:42|0:33:49|At the same time, Huang, Hei, Hong, and [Wu Xie], along with many armed special forces, arrived at Changbai Mountain in a large helicopter.
0:34:0|0:34:11|While [Zhang Qiling] was arranging the plan, Huang Heihong and Wuxie had already entered the scene of the tomb raiders' annual meeting through a secret passage. At the same time, the six residents of the Love Apartment also changed into the same costumes as the other tomb raiders.
0:34:12|0:34:26|Several people appeared on stage like a fashion show. The first to appear was [Hu Yifei] in a tank top, her outfit serious yet sexy. Following closely behind was [Lu Ziqiao] in a pirate-like attire, who may have some misunderstandings about tomb raiders.
0:34:26|0:34:41|Next up is [Tang Youyou] carrying a bow and arrow, special forces soldier [Zhang Wei] with a machine gun in hand, and the clown girl [Chen Meijia] wielding a baseball bat. The last one to appear, [Zeng Xiaoxian], is the funniest, while others are holding weapons, he is holding a magnifying glass, looking like an explorer.
0:35:22|0:35:25|Seeing [Zeng Xiaoxian] in a dilemma, everyone walked into the press conference venue.
0:36:28|0:36:35|Shortly after, they were taken to the underground warehouse. The administrator turned on the power, and a large sphere in the warehouse lit up.
0:36:51|0:37:5|The two of them couldn't help but be intrigued by the high-tech spherical object in front of them. [Xeng Xiaoxian] casually touched a button. Unexpectedly, the doors on both sides of the sphere slowly opened, and driven by curiosity, the two of them sat inside.
0:37:5|0:37:10|Only two seats in the cabin looked somewhat normal, while the rest of the buttons and indicator lights were unfamiliar to both [Hu Yifei] and [Tang Youyou].
0:38:59|0:39:5|The [Decision Maker No.2], standing three stories high, leaped lightly from the stage to behind the crowd.
0:40:50|0:40:55|Decision Maker No. 1 panicked immediately upon seeing No. 2 aiming the gun at himself.
0:41:19|0:41:34|In a moment of urgency, [Lu Ziqiao] casually flicked the trackball that had just emerged, causing the "Decider No. 1" to instantly start rolling. The bullets fired by the enemies could not cause substantial harm to him. While rolling, he also knocked [Wu Xie] unconscious on the ground, and Fatty took [Wu Xie]'s pistol.
0:41:37|0:41:47|And immediately ran to [Wu Xie]'s side to check the situation. At this moment, a large number of special forces soldiers started shooting at Fatty, and just at this critical moment, [Xeng Xiaoxian] drove [Decision Maker No.1] to shield the two of them.
0:42:0|0:42:8|Soon, the remaining three special forces soldiers also received their boxed meals. At this moment, outside the venue, people were still dancing, completely unaware of the impending danger.
0:42:16|0:42:27|Several people were scared by the fire in the venue. When they saw the opportunity to hide in [Decision Maker No. 1], they even threw their weapons aside. In this way, a machine that was originally only able to accommodate two people now had a total of eight people squeezed into it.
0:42:48|0:43:9|[Decision Maker No.1] stumbled forward in the chaos, and at that moment, the wall behind the venue suddenly exploded. As the smoke cleared, a massive armored mech stood towering in place, causing everyone to flee in panic. Just then, [Decision Maker No.2] also activated its automatic attack mode.
0:43:13|0:43:20|Two missiles were launched towards the direction where they were. The first ship's mast hurriedly dodged, but just as he avoided the missile, he hadn't recovered yet.
0:43:20|0:43:38|Machine gun number 2 was already pouring bullets towards him, but luckily the defense of number 1 was indeed strong enough. Even with such intense firepower coverage, it did not cause substantial damage to him. He continued to agilely dodge behind various cover under the control of everyone, and this high-speed movement also made everyone hiding in the mecha almost unable to react.
0:43:38|0:43:52|The intense barrage from Destroyer No. 2 has turned the anti-law street into ruins. Just as No. 1 is about to have no way out, No. 2 also unleashes its killer move, with a missile launcher on the back of the mecha carrying 18 missiles.
0:43:52|0:44:10|In the next second, 18 missiles were simultaneously launched towards [Decision Maker One], and the entire street looked like a hell, with anything in front of the missiles instantly turning into nothingness. Despite such a carpet bombing, [Decision Maker One] managed to break through the fire line with a defense as solid as a rock.
0:44:10|0:44:27|They ran straight towards the huge ventilation duct. The excitement of the group was like being reborn, but the next moment, their smiles froze. It turned out that the [Destroyer No.1] had crashed through the mountain, and beneath their feet was a bottomless abyss. Even if the sturdy [Destroyer No.1] fell to the valley floor, there would be absolutely no chance of survival.
0:45:20|0:45:26|After he stood up, an inflatable doll popped up on the seat, as if flying the plane for him.
0:45:31|0:45:34|Wu Xie, who has been healed, has regained his memory.
0:46:28|0:46:30|[Xiao Xian] stood up triumphantly.
0:46:38|0:46:41|[Hu Yifei] confidently walked up to [Zeng Xiaoxian].
0:46:45|0:46:52|[Xiao Xian] shook his head. Seeing [Xiao Xian] nod, Yifei continued speaking.
0:46:57|0:47:4|[Xiao Xian] nodded firmly with determination. At this moment, [Xiao Xian] was still confused.
0:47:6|0:47:21|Zhang Qiling threw a punch directly at [Xiao Xian]'s face, followed by a series of combination punches. Without knowing what was happening, [Xiao Xian] was mercilessly knocked down by Zhang Qiling. But with the protagonist's halo, [Xiao Xian] seemed immune to this level of attack.
0:47:21|0:47:26|The next second, he stood up from the ground unharmed.
0:47:33|0:47:43|[Wu Xie] finished speaking and immediately pounced on [Xeng Xiaoxian], delivering a brutal beating without mercy. He didn't stop until he was exhausted, but to his surprise, [Xeng Xiaoxian] emerged unscathed.
0:47:53|0:47:58|On the other side, in the ruined street, Huang Hei Hong angrily asked his subordinates.
0:48:9|0:48:12|The yellow, black, and red face revealed a sinister smile.
0:48:18|0:48:46|Wu Xie and others, after hours of flying, finally arrived at the location of the Cloud Top Heavenly Palace. Tang Youyou curiously asked, "How should we find this guardian spirit soul you mentioned?" The guardian spirit soul is the protector of the Bronze Gate. To summon him, there must be clues behind the gate. We need to enter the Bronze Gate to unravel the ultimate mystery. There is a secret passage at the foot of the mountain leading to the Cloud Top Heavenly Palace. We must hurry to arrive at the Bronze Gate before the Yellow, Black, and Red. The group, fully armed, walked out of the plane.
0:48:46|0:48:59|Holding a climbing pole, [Wu Xie] carefully walks on the snow. Not far ahead, she looks towards [Zhang Qiling], who is silently kneeling on a huge rock at the edge of the cliff, muttering words of worship.
0:48:59|0:49:10|At this moment, as everyone looked at this perplexing scene, they all stopped in their tracks. After a moment, [Zhang Qiling] bowed three times towards Mount Taibai. [Lu Ziqiao] looked at it in confusion and asked.
0:49:12|0:49:18|Wu Xie turned around and found that Zhang Wei's eyes were twitching frantically. At the same time, Tang Youyou also noticed something unusual with her body.
0:49:46|0:49:53|Eyelid twitching, protruding teeth, crows, black cats - all these ominous signs happened at the same time.
0:50:0|0:50:3|As the music just ended, the flag made by [Hu Yifei] was broken and fell to the ground.
0:50:8|0:50:16|The tomb raider Wu Xie, who has experienced countless tomb raids, no longer acts tough when he sees the situation, and quickly kneels down to join the others in defeating the enemy. On the other side, [Xu Xiaoxian] speaks to Decision Maker No. 1.
0:50:34|0:50:38|To Zeng Xiaoxian's surprise, Wang Fatty was watching a soccer match inside the machine.
0:50:58|0:51:8|Moments later, Hu Yifei soared into the sky as the decision maker. As soon as the words fell, he landed in front of the group.
0:51:23|0:51:44|When the group studying the map came to their senses, they found a deep pit smashed into the glacier in front of them. Looking into the pit, they saw the No.1 Abyss floating on the water. [Zhang Wei] noticed a mechanism carved with exquisite patterns on a nearby stone.
0:51:44|0:51:48|After blowing away the floating snow above, he looked at [Hu Yifei] beside him with a puzzled expression.
0:51:53|0:52:10|At the moment when the mechanism was activated, the deep pit where [Xeng Xiaoxian] and Wang [Fatty] were located suddenly roared. The next second, the surroundings of the deep pit began to tremble like an earthquake. Immediately after, a huge vortex formed on the water surface. In the blink of an eye, with determination, Number One took the two of them and was swept into the depths of the hole.
0:52:10|0:52:13|[Tang Youyou] looked at this familiar scene and said.
0:52:17|0:52:28|[Tang Youyou]'s flower shadow had just fallen, and a few people faintly heard the roaring sound coming from the mountaintop. The sound grew louder and more urgent, and everyone looked towards the source.
0:52:31|0:52:49|The speed of this avalanche is beyond imagination. In just a few seconds, as they ran only a few dozen meters, the avalanche had caught up to them halfway up the mountain. [Wu Xie] led the group, sprinting on the perilous cliff, where a slight misstep could send them plummeting into the abyss. Faced with this overwhelming avalanche, they had no time to think about much else.
0:52:51|0:52:57|Just as the leader of the thousand troops, [Wu Xie], led everyone into the cave ahead, the avalanche almost simultaneously swallowed the entrance.
0:53:26|0:53:32|Trapped by an avalanche at the mouth of frozen snow, [Wu Xie] is still trying to dig out a passage with a shovel.
0:54:29|0:54:32|Yifei saw Wu Xie looking speechless.
0:54:39|0:54:43|And so, [Wu Xie] unexpectedly started teaching a few people about tomb robbing in the cave.
0:54:55|0:55:3|As soon as [Wu Xie] finished speaking, the candle mysteriously extinguished. Little did they expect, the Mei family actually lit a torch.
0:56:30|0:56:41|The group of Tang Youyou and others were speaking anxiously, leaving Wu Xie puzzled. Seeing them deep in thought, Zhang Qiling asked slowly.
0:56:51|0:57:6|He said it himself, and also discovered something unusual from his phone. When he put down the phone and looked around, he found that the entire cave was filled with starlight like the Milky Way, rapidly approaching him. Just as he was still shocked, a snake had already slipped into his clothes.
0:57:6|0:57:14|Newcomer [Xeng Xiaoxian] was so scared by the situation that he stood still and dared not move. Just as a large amount of oil and salt was about to engulf him, Wang [Fatty] knocked it into the ball.
0:57:23|0:57:28|[Lu Ziqiao] sent a red envelope in the WeChat group, only to have it instantly snatched by [Zeng Xiaoxian].
0:57:39|0:57:53|After a loud noise, the small oil and salt that were originally scattered with iron balls immediately scattered away. In the darkness, there was a huge creature approaching the iron balls. Through the screen of Decision Maker No.1, the two saw a tremendously large eye staring at them.
0:57:53|0:58:8|Soon after, strong tremors were felt all around, as two giant oil-salt creatures, covered in magma and tens of meters long, surrounded the iron ball. The deafening roars from the giant oil-salt creatures made people break out in a cold sweat. Subsequently, in order to shatter the iron ball, the two creatures repeatedly rammed their heads against it.
0:58:13|0:58:23|With a full force strike from the giant oil and salt, the iron ball flew right into the nearby dark passage. After rolling down the dark passage for a while, the iron ball dropped into another extremely dark cave.
0:58:27|0:58:31|After turning on the light, [Hu Yifei] was shocked to see skeletons scattered all over the place.
0:59:54|1:0:9|Reluctant decision-maker number one extended a large iron claw from behind, grabbing Hu Yifei like a doll. While the two were still marveling at the power of the machine, Hu Yifei was smoothly placed into the trunk.
1:0:17|1:0:22|Hu Yifei took out pots and pans for battle, and the giant oil and salt roared even more angrily.
1:0:25|1:0:59|[Xiao Xian] and Fatty hurriedly drove the Decider No. 1 to flee rapidly in an attempt to shake off the giant oil-salt creature behind them. However, despite its massive size, the creature moved faster than a metal ball with the support of its dozens of legs, forcing the two to maneuver the metal ball around the walls. Fortunately, the metal ball's agile movements cleverly dodged the attacks of the giant oil-salt creature, and they finally escaped when they flew out of the cave. The two survivors were excitedly shouting in relief. On the other side, [Wu Xie] and his team were cautiously exploring when suddenly the background music started playing, instantly energizing the officers of the Love Apartment.
1:1:11|1:1:25|The original song turned out to be the theme song of "Love Apartment", "My Future Comes from Change". They didn't care about any demons or monsters along the way, with happy smiles on their faces, walking and jumping joyfully.
1:1:25|1:1:29|Only [Wu Xie] and [Zhang Qiling] were at a loss, not knowing what evil these people had fallen into.
1:1:30|1:1:44|The group continued to explore deep into the cave, accompanied by music. [Wu Xie] and his companions, along with [Zeng Xiaoxian] and Fatty, although taking different paths, were well aware that their destination was the Cloud Top Heavenly Palace, which the entire tomb-robbing world yearned for.
1:1:44|1:2:0|[Wu Xie], [Zhang Qiling], and Fatty, also became much happier with the addition of the Love Apartment crew. Although they were not very serious and often joked around, they remained united and helped each other along the way. The Love Apartment crew did not become a burden on the tomb-raiding journey.
1:2:0|1:2:12|On the contrary, with the protagonist's halo around them, the monsters and demons are forced to keep their distance. They climb narrow cliffs together, pass through caves filled with oil and salt, step over the magma at the bottom of the cave, and also arrive in secret chambers full of gold.
1:2:13|1:2:28|But even in the face of many difficulties and temptations, nothing could stop everyone from moving forward. [Xeng Xiaoxian] and Fatty drove the Land Rover No. 1, singing all the way, and the group of Wu Xie also arrived at a beautiful scenic spot. They watched the small fish in the water.
1:3:11|1:3:14|[Lu Ziqiao] was amazed by the absurd scene.
1:3:33|1:3:43|After listening to [Zhang Qiling], the only remaining delivery guy put on his helmet, walked confidently towards the outside under everyone's gaze. [Lu Ziqiao] walked up to Yifei and Youyou and started complaining.
1:3:55|1:4:7|Chen Meijia was seen feeding Zhang Qiling chicken nuggets on the side, while Wu Xie, not far away, looked jealous. At that moment, Zhang Wei also walked up to Wu Xie with takeout and said.
1:5:29|1:5:35|[Zhang Wei] listened, pondered for a moment, then picked up the bottle and took a big sip before saying.
1:7:29|1:7:44|Although reluctant, [Hu Yifei] dialed [Zeng Xiaoxian]'s number under the urging of everyone. When there was no response from the other end of the line, [Zeng Xiaoxian] speculated.
1:8:26|1:8:40|And on the other end of the phone, [Zeng Xiaoxian] was still immersed in the goodnight just now, constantly guessing [Hu Yifei]'s intentions. After the game session ended, everyone laid down on the ground and fell asleep in the cave.
1:8:40|1:8:47|Chen Meijia, who was fast asleep, was startled by the falling books, and when she turned around, she saw a small, round-headed owl.
1:8:50|1:9:8|The little owl flew to a higher stone pillar when it saw someone waking up. [Chen Meijia] looked at this cute little creature, not knowing what it was up to. But moments later, it flew out of the cave. Intrigued, [Chen Meijia] followed, but slipped and fell to the bottom of the valley.
1:9:9|1:9:16|Chen Meijia slid down the narrow passage all the way to the edge of the cliff where he fell.
1:9:16|1:9:32|Chen Meijia was shocked by the scene before her. She even forgot about her own pain. The scenery at the bottom of the valley was calm, completely different from the fragrant flowers and chirping birds just now. Countless caves covered the sides of the valley hundreds of meters high, like pores on the mountain. Chen Meijia stared intently and broke out in a cold sweat.
1:9:32|1:9:53|In each cave, there was a nearly two-meter tall adult owl sleeping. Everyone tried to sneak away, but as soon as they turned around, they were startled by the owl next to them. Just as they regained their composure, they were knocked down by the donkey bridge that came out looking for them, and both fell to the bottom of the valley.
1:9:57|1:10:3|After [Chen Meijia] stopped Ziqiao from speaking loudly, she carefully pointed around the cave to the sleeping owls.
1:10:17|1:10:23|Lu Ziqiao understood her meaning. And Chen Meijia just smiled and nodded.
1:10:24|1:10:46|Unexpectedly, the two of them started communicating fluently using their own invented sign language. Lu Ziqiao, who was full of jealousy the whole way, suddenly complained about Tang Youyou's excessive infatuation with Zhang Qiling, while Tang Youyou deliberately avoided the question. Seeing this, Ziqiao didn't ask further and signaled for Tang Youyou to leave quietly.
1:10:46|1:10:52|Awkwardly, just as she took the first step, [Chen Meijia] stepped on a squeaky toy chicken. Right after scolding [Lu Ziqiao], she then accidentally popped a balloon.
1:11:4|1:11:18|Never did they expect that in the valley filled with bones, there would be so many things capable of making noise. The two of them were unlucky, every step they took lightly would trigger a mechanism. After this round of actions, tens of thousands of eyes were instantly fixed on them in the cave.
1:11:18|1:11:27|Just as the two were at a loss, they saw the owl's head slowly rotate 180 degrees, and then its head opened wide and rushed towards them.
1:11:32|1:11:49|In an instant, the sky above the entire canyon was covered with densely packed owls. [Lu Ziqiao] and [Chen Meijia] could only desperately run away in the face of such an attack, but the speed difference was just too great. Before they could run a few steps, the owls had already caught up from behind. Helpless, the two could only hide temporarily in a nearby giant rock formation.
1:11:50|1:11:55|Unexpectedly, the owl knocked the giant rock askew, surrounding the two of them in no time.
1:11:55|1:12:8|At the critical moment, [Zhang Qiling] rushed over upon hearing the sound. Facing a group of owls, he remained calm and composed, holding a sword in his right hand. He cut his palm with the sword, allowing the blood of the unicorn within him to stain the blade, then exerted all his strength to plunge the sword into the ground.
1:12:8|1:12:33|In an instant, [Lu Ziqiao] and [Chen Meijia] were surrounded by three archers. The next second, wearing armor and wielding a long sword, [Lu Ziqiao] paid no attention to the battle, seizing the opportunity to take [Chen Meijia] and run backwards. However, [Chen Meijia] twisted her ankle and moved slowly. Without hesitation, [Lu Ziqiao] picked up [Chen Meijia].
1:12:55|1:13:1|After passing through the narrow and closed cave, a flower sea emitting a faint light suddenly appeared before their eyes.
1:13:8|1:13:14|After admiring for a moment, as they prepared to continue forward, Hu Yifei saw Zhang Wei unfastening his belt.
1:13:29|1:13:44|[Zhang Wei] was having a great time when a tranquilizer dart suddenly shot into the back of his neck. After pulling it out, [Zhang Wei] asked what was going on. But before he could finish his sentence, he fainted and collapsed on the ground. Shortly after, [Tang Youyou] was also hit by a dart.
1:13:44|1:13:53|Realizing the situation, [Wu Xie] and [Hu Yifei] quickly hid behind cover. Just as [Hu Yifei] was about to engage the enemy in battle, she saw the tranquilizer dart stuck in her leg and helplessly said to [Wu Xie].
1:13:58|1:14:15|Wu Xie's position has been locked by the enemy. Even if he exposes a finger, he will be hit by several tranquilizer darts. Self-defense is a problem, let alone saving others. After thinking for a moment, Wu Xie couldn't bear it and ran towards the cave. He put away the yellow-black-red sword-shaped tranquilizer gun and ordered his men to tie up the three unconscious people.
1:14:15|1:14:32|Several hours later, [Zeng Xiaoxian] and Fatty drove the Jue Di Zhe No.1 to the edge of a cliff. The Jue Di Zhe No.1 fired two flares into the sky, revealing the Cloud Top Heaven Palace hundreds of meters below the cliff. Despite looking down on the palace from above, the two were still awed by its grandeur.
1:14:32|1:14:50|Fatty Wang said after seeing it. At this moment, Decision Maker No. 1 suddenly noticed movement on the road. After zooming in on the screen, it turned out that the special forces in yellow, black, and red were tying up Hu Yifei and the other two, heading towards the Cloud Top Heavenly Palace. Fatty Wang said to [Xiao Xian].
1:15:4|1:15:19|Not long after, the special forces entered the Yun Ding Sky Palace and set up equipment. [Hu Yifei] and [Tang Youyou] were tied up on the side, while [Zhang Wei] slowly woke up from the electric chair. [Tang Youyou] pointed to the various blood-stained tools on the table, and at this moment, Huang Heihong spoke.
1:15:57|1:16:9|Enraged, Wong Fei-hung ordered his men to activate the electric chair switch. Seeing that Zhang Wei still didn't speak, Wong Fei-hung gestured for his men to increase the electric current. Unexpectedly, Hu Yifei and Tang Youyou on the side began to provide assistance.
1:16:14|1:16:26|[Zhang Wei] was shocked all over and couldn't speak. Wong Fei-hung, seeing this, increased the electric current time and time again. At this moment, he didn't realize at all that the water under his feet was slowly flowing towards the electricity. The next second, Wong Fei-hung was electrocuted.
1:16:56|1:17:3|After a moment, the henchman wiped off the water and saved [Hu Yifei]. After [Hu Yifei] changed his wig, he said,
1:17:23|1:17:29|Unexpectedly, after [Huang Heihong] went out, he actually blew up the passage. [Tang Youyou] looked at the blocked passage, worriedly saying.
1:17:32|1:17:40|Just then, a strange sound was heard. The two looked over and saw the stone coffin covered in cobwebs on the main hall slowly moving.
1:17:40|1:17:55|Although they were extremely frightened, their hands were bound by iron chains and they couldn't move. They could only watch helplessly as this eerie scene unfolded. Suddenly, a hand firmly grasped the stone coffin, and the next moment, [Zhang Qiling] stood up. Then, Ziqiao carried [Chen Meijia] out of the coffin.
1:18:0|1:18:2|[Zhang Qiling] walked over and cut the iron chain for the two.
1:19:18|1:19:39|As the Huang Heihong activation switch was turned on, an innocent cloud suddenly rose, and after the explosion that echoed through the entire underground palace, everyone curiously looked towards the bronze door, only to see that the bronze door in the smoke was surprisingly intact. [Xiao Xin] sighed. Huang Heihong looked at the barrage of mockery in the live broadcast, awkwardly explaining.
1:19:44|1:19:48|After Huang Heihong ended the live broadcast, he turned to his subordinates and said.
1:20:13|1:20:33|Meanwhile, has the crystal gu of the Zhang family been prepared? As they were speaking, the bronze door behind Huang, Hei, and Hong slowly opened. Once again, a dazzling light emanated from the door. Everyone present couldn't believe their eyes as they looked towards the bronze door. Just as Huang, Hei, and Hong were thinking about how to explain to the audience, their henchmen beside them said in a dejected tone, "Boss, someone is disrespecting us."
1:20:38|1:20:42|This is [Xiao Xian] driving the Decision Maker No.1 to the front of the Bronze Gate.
1:20:54|1:21:3|Wong Fei-hung saw only Fatty and [Xeng Xiaoxian], and then said.
1:21:3|1:21:20|As soon as the words fell, [Wu Xie] Zhang Qiling, who had been hiding in the dark and waiting for an opportunity, and the Love Apartment group with almost no combat power, walked to the bronze door with weapons in hand. Even [Zhang Wei], who was shocked to the point of being unable to take care of himself, stared fiercely at Wong Fei-hung. The group vowed to protect the secret behind the bronze door at all costs.
1:21:36|1:21:43|Before [Xeng Xiaoxian] could say a second sentence, Huang Heihong pulled the trigger, but Yi Fei instantly arrived in front of [Xeng Xiaoxian] and caught the bullet.
1:22:34|1:22:39|[Zhang Wei] carefully took out the manual for the protagonist's halo and said after reading it.
1:23:12|1:23:26|[Lu Ziqiao] and [Chen Meijia], this pair of long-standing adversaries, finally no longer hide their love for each other. At the last moment of their lives, their index fingers intertwined, slowly closing their eyes. Meanwhile, [Wu Xie] and the other two hiding on the side also decided to take a desperate gamble.
1:23:26|1:23:34|After a moment of eye contact, [Hu Yifei] emerged from cover and unleashed her inner fury on the special forces. In an instant, the previously quiet underground palace was once again engulfed in a barrage of gunfire.
1:23:35|1:23:51|The special forces on the front line were also defeated by the sudden appearance of the three individuals, but faced with too many enemies, the underground palace quieted down once again after a moment. Behind the bronze door, it was pitch black, with only a towering tree standing tall within.
1:23:58|1:24:14|After hearing that, [Xiao Xian] began to carefully observe the big tree. This big tree was strange, with an incredibly thick trunk and branches that blocked out the sun, but it had never grown a single leaf. Inside, a thin layer of water covered everything. [Xiao Xian] spoke after seeing the reflection in the water.
1:24:27|1:24:32|[Xiao Xian] turned back in surprise after hearing it, never expected to see the WiFi password actually written on the big tree.
1:24:47|1:24:58|Fatty and Wu Xie in front of the bronze gate of Zhang were captured, although they did not die. [Zhang Qiling] was seriously injured and hid above the stone wall.
1:25:36|1:25:40|As soon as the words fell, [Xiao Zhan] was inspired by his own words.
1:26:10|1:26:21|Hu Yifei listened, looking at him weakly, and noticed something wrong. [Zeng Xiaoxian] looked down and saw Yifei covering the wound on his waist. Blood kept flowing from the wound with his heartbeat, soaking his clothes.
1:26:26|1:26:28|Yifei used all her strength and threw herself into [Xiao Xian]'s arms.
1:27:4|1:27:15|Hu Yifei looked at the self-blaming [Xeng Xiaoxian] with reluctance in her eyes, then slowly raised her hand covered in blood, gently caressing her face. At this moment, Hu Yifei finally opened up her heart to [Xeng Xiaoxian].
1:27:43|1:28:2|Yifei closed her eyes after sincerely saying goodnight to [Xiao Xian]. Xiao Xian didn't dare to make eye contact with the woman he had secretly loved for a long time until the very last moment. It wasn't until Yifei left that he trembled and called out her name.
1:28:2|1:28:10|[Zeng Xiaoxian] held onto the departed Hu Yifei tightly, unable to speak. He felt the gradually cooling body temperature of Yifei, filled with despair.
1:28:11|1:28:19|He looked towards the deep pit beside him, a bold idea forming in his mind. Then, he picked up Hu Yifei and walked to the edge of the hole.
1:28:43|1:28:56|[Xiao Xian] spoke, gazing resolutely into the depths of space for a moment before jumping without hesitation. In the real world, [Xiao Xian] suddenly woke up in the hospital room, gasping for breath, and asked the doctor beside him.
1:29:45|1:29:53|[Zeng Xiaoxian] looked at the doctor leaving with a sense of helplessness. At that moment, the patient sitting on the opposite bed, wearing glasses and reading a newspaper, suddenly spoke,
1:31:45|1:31:52|Uncle San listened and slowly got up from the sickbed, sighing deeply.
1:32:28|1:32:37|[Zeng Xiaoxian] returned to the entrance of the Bronze Gate, only to find that the deep pit beside it was slowly disappearing. Soon after, the towering tree was also covered in blood-red color.
1:33:21|1:33:27|Zhang Qiling pointed to his lower body, and Hu Yifei looked down, only to find that he had turned into a soul floating in the air.
1:33:38|1:33:41|[Zheng Xiaoxian] furrowed his brows and after a moment of contemplation, said,
1:33:45|1:33:49|The rest of the victims were also floating in the air.
1:34:21|1:34:37|Zhang Qiling couldn't help but touch it when he saw it, and unexpectedly, Zhang Qiling's blood activated the armor. The left arm of the protective armor suddenly flew to Chen Meijia's arm and emitted a dim light. After the bright light dissipated, Chen Meijia was actually reshaped.
1:35:0|1:35:16|Zhang Qiling's eyes were particularly determined. After adjusting her sitting posture, she placed the porcelain jar in front of her and hung her bleeding palm above it. The blood of the Kirin in her body dripped into the jar, making Zhang Qiling, who was already seriously injured, even weaker.
1:35:16|1:35:23|Several people in the Aiqin Apartment were deeply moved when they saw Zhang Qiling sacrificing his own life to protect the bronze door, shedding tears uncontrollably.
1:35:25|1:35:43|The blood of the Kirin has filled a porcelain jar. [Zhang Qiling]'s frail body seemed to have been drained, pale and lacking the strength to even stand up. Therefore, the heavy blade, drenched in the blood of the Kirin, fell on [Chen Meijia]. [Chen Meijia] walked towards the protective armor with exceptional seriousness.
1:35:43|1:35:48|The hope of the whole village was accidentally shattered by [Chen Meijia]. At this moment, she looked towards [Zhang Qiling].
1:35:59|1:36:9|[Hu Yifei] wields the demon-slaying sword, while [Tang Youyou] is armed with a bow for banishing evil. [Lu Ziqiao] is clad in defensive armor, while [Chen Meijia] and [Zhang Wei] each wear symbolic left and right arm guards representing magic and strength.
1:36:9|1:36:16|While [Xiao Xian] only got a skirt with no abilities, the person with the artifact destroyed the headquarters of the Yellow, Black, and Red again.
1:36:16|1:36:30|[Hu Yifei] appeared in front of the enemy in a grand manner. The special forces soldier did not dare to be careless and quickly hid behind cover. In the instant when the special forces soldier pulled the trigger, [Hu Yifei] activated her special ability to bind arrows, instantly moving in front of the soldier and killing him.
1:36:30|1:36:36|Although [Hu Yifei] has the ability to teleport instantly, she still pauses in place at the moment of killing the enemy.
1:36:36|1:36:46|Just as [Hu Yifei] was joyfully killing the enemies, a bullet accurately shot towards [Hu Yifei]'s head. In this critical moment, a transparent barrier suddenly appeared in front of [Hu Yifei], allowing teammates to be shielded behind this invincible barrier.
1:37:3|1:37:19|At this moment, a sniper was preparing to ambush the two from behind. Just as he aimed, he found his body slowly lifting into the air. This ability was wielded by [Chen Meijia] with the magical left arm. The sniper was lifted by [Chen Meijia] to several tens of meters high and then thrown heavily. [Tang Youyou] quietly ran out from behind the group.
1:37:43|1:37:46|[Xiao Xian] lowered his head, looked at his skirt, and said helplessly.
1:37:48|1:38:2|At this moment, the soldier who had been thrown away stood up dizzily. [Xeng Xiaoxian] hurriedly picked up a brick from the ground and knocked him out. In just a few minutes, all the special forces were taken care of. A signal soldier picked up the phone in panic and called for help.
1:38:10|1:38:36|At this moment, Hu Yifei, Tang Youyou, and Lu Ziqiao arrived at the battlefield in the Exterminator No. 2. The missile launcher behind the Exterminator No. 2 quickly targeted their own people, who decided to confront it with their superpowers. However, after the missile was launched, their own people instantly broke formation and fled.
1:38:38|1:39:2|Under the intense firepower of the Jue Di Zhe No.2, even superpowers cannot confront it head-on. Several people were forced to take cover and dared not show themselves. At this moment, Wang Fatty picked up a machine gun that had fallen on the ground and bravely fought back. Just as No.2 was about to grab him, [Zhang Qiling] appeared in time and pulled him aside.
1:39:8|1:39:27|Fatty, still unwilling to give up, crowded towards Decision Maker No. 2 with a grenade. The impact of the grenade forced him to take two steps back. Zhang Wei seized the opportunity, leaped into the air, and flew still above Decision Maker No. 2. Then, with all his strength, he struck in all directions at the cockpit, but this powerful blow prevented the mecha from falling apart.
1:39:27|1:39:33|Next, Number Two delivered a heavy iron fist, sending him flying into a pillar, but luckily [Chen Meijia] caught him smoothly with her superpowers.
1:39:35|1:39:48|Just as [Chen Meijia] was looking at the deceased [Zhang Qiling], the ruthless Number Two's big foot came down heavily towards them. At this critical moment, Ziqiao activated his armor ability and managed to withstand the impact of tens of tons of force.
1:39:48|1:39:57|Lu Ziqiao's strong protective instinct brought out all the power of the armor, and the huge mechanical foot was slowly lifted up.
1:40:2|1:40:9|Zhang Qiling, who was injured, limped away. Seeing Zhang Qiling walking away, Lu Ziqiao couldn't hold on any longer and collapsed under the pressure.
1:40:11|1:40:27|Purple Bridge, who had just exerted all her strength, was unable to stand up anymore and could only let the giant iron foot of the Number Two Terminator trample mercilessly on her. Yellow, black, and red saw that the trampling did not cause serious harm to Purple Bridge in armor, so they threw him into the air and then opened fire with a machine gun.
1:40:27|1:40:42|Ziqiao relied entirely on instinct to block the flying bullets with a barrier. But it wasn't over yet. Just then, the Number Two of the Desperate jumped up and, using a mechanical claw, slammed Ziqiao against the heavy cannon. With one shot, Ziqiao was blasted back to the ground. Immediately after, several missiles followed in quick succession.
1:40:42|1:40:59|Ziqiao lay on the ground, completely powerless, and Chen Meijia, who hadn't gone far, witnessed everything with her own eyes. She watched her beloved Ziqiao being cruelly abused in order to protect her, and her anger could no longer be contained. Chen Meijia's eyes lit up, and she trembled as she unleashed her superpowers.
1:41:7|1:41:10|This wave of attacks has severely damaged the mecha.
1:41:34|1:41:49|At the command of Yifei, everyone launched their attacks. [Zhang Wei] shot arrows and threw giant rocks, knocking the mecha down. Then, with the support of Meijia's superpowers, Yifei flew towards the mecha wielding the demon-slaying sword. In the air, Yifei's will also transformed the sword into its ultimate form.
1:41:49|1:42:5|The originally one-meter-long treasure sword instantly spewed out raging flames, Huang Feihong panicked and fired at Yifei. At this moment, [Lu Ziqiao] used up all her strength to activate a barrier to protect Yifei. [Hu Yifei] also lived up to expectations, delivering a full-force blow that directly cut through the mech, but unfortunately did not harm Huang Heihong.
1:42:5|1:42:14|The mecha fist strikes again, pushing [Hu Yifei] back several meters. What Huang, Hei, and Hong didn't notice was that, in the moment of being thrown back, [Hu Yifei] threw the sword towards Zhang Qiling behind the mecha.
1:42:14|1:42:26|Being a spiritual protector, [Zhang Qiling] instantly established a spiritual connection with the sword upon receiving it, allowing the sword's power to be unleashed to the fullest. With a mighty swing, [Zhang Qiling] severed the iron arm of the No. 2 Terminator in an instant.
1:42:56|1:43:10|Surprisingly, in the ruins, the No. 2 Jedi actually repaired itself and slowly stood up.
1:43:12|1:43:23|The group formed a formation ready for battle, but their bodies immediately turned into souls. Wong Fei-hung threw Wu Xie to the ground, then raised his foot again, ready to crush him.
1:43:26|1:43:43|Everyone rushed towards [Wu Xie], but even with the ability to activate the sword's teleportation, they couldn't rescue the unconscious [Wu Xie] from under the iron feet. [Xeng Xiaoxian] knew this well, and as he quickly brainstormed solutions in his mind, Decision Maker Number One brought the protagonist's halo to [Xeng Xiaoxian]'s front.
1:43:43|1:43:52|He looked at the protagonist's halo, instantly recalling the past few days of this adventure that they shouldn't have been involved in. At this moment, without hesitation, he threw the protagonist's halo towards [Wu Xie].
1:43:53|1:44:9|At the moment when Iron Foot was about to make contact with Wu Xie, a halo formed a barrier between the two in an instant, but the next second the halo was unexpectedly crushed by Iron Foot. With a triumphant look on his face, Iron Foot lifted his foot, intending to mock everyone, but to his surprise, Wu Xie slowly climbed up from the ground.
1:44:31|1:44:47|Unexpectedly, [Wu Xie] stood up again and shook his hair. With every step Huang, Hei, and Hong took, [Wu Xie] stood up again. And each time [Wu Xie] stood up, he changed to a different style, looking more and more like he deserved a beating, which infuriated Huang, Hei, and Hong.
1:44:47|1:44:54|Originally, the protagonist's halo was not shattered just now. Instead, under the tight pressure of gravity, the halo merged faster with [Wu Xie].
1:44:57|1:45:9|[Wu Xie] took the shotgun from Fatty and, with the blessing of the halo, shot the vital point of the golden armor without even looking. Seeing this, Fatty quickly grabbed the gun.
1:45:27|1:45:36|[Zeng Xiaoxian] placed his hand on the iron ball. After [Hu Yifei] hesitantly placed her hand on it, the iron ball unexpectedly increased in weight by one notch.
1:45:45|1:46:0|After listening to [Zeng Xiaoxian]'s words, everyone instantly understood his meaning and stacked their hands on Decision Maker No. 1. With each additional person, Decision Maker No. 1's power increased, but when everyone converged their energy onto Decision Maker No. 1, it unexpectedly emitted a dazzling light.
1:46:23|1:46:32|Decision Maker Number One detonated himself in the air with the will of the group, sacrificing himself along with Huang, Hei, and Hong. After the battle, the trio of Grave Robbers supported each other and gathered together.
1:46:59|1:47:16|Wang [Fatty] said, supporting the two as they walked towards the cave entrance. However, after only a few steps, [Zhang Qiling] seemed to resonate strongly with a mysterious force. He suddenly stopped, turned around, and looked back at the bronze door. Floating in front of the motionless door was a guardian spirit armor that seemed like a soul, but it was different from before.
1:47:16|1:47:26|He seemed to have gained a bit of vitality. The next morning, the honking of cars woke up the bustling city of Shanghai, and the residents of the Love Apartment gathered in the hall as usual.
1:49:38|1:49:44|It also sets off the brilliance of the fireworks.
