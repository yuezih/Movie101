0:1:24|0:1:40|In January 1949, the People's Liberation Army of China surrounded the Nationalist Party's 500,000 troops in Beijing and Tianjin. The final assault of the Pingjin Campaign was imminent, and whether Beijing could be peacefully liberated depended on the battle in Tianjin.
0:1:43|0:2:4|At this moment in the city of Tianjin, with hidden treasures everywhere, the reconnaissance soldier [Ma Baoshu] from the People's Liberation Army Artillery Reconnaissance Company dashed into a defensive high-rise building to avoid the bullets from the high-altitude platform opposite. However, a mortar shell came straight through the bombed-out window, almost blasting [Ma Baoshu] out of the high-rise. Fortunately, his comrades pulled him back into the building just in time.
0:2:6|0:2:19|Rescuing Ma Baoshu were his platoon leader Cai Xingfu and his comrades from the platoon, Ermao. Faced with gunfire from the opposite high-rise building, before they could catch their breath, Cai Xingfu quickly patted Ma Baoshu, signaling him to quickly move to the top of the building to take cover.
0:2:19|0:2:28|Three of them hid under a low wall on the rooftop. [Cai Xingfu] and [Ma Baoshu] peeked out slightly to observe the enemy's firepower, then raised their rifles to shoot at the enemy for a while.
0:2:55|0:3:2|In an instant, two shells were accurately launched towards the stronghold, with [Cai Xingfu] giving a thumbs-up and aiming at a high point.
0:3:8|0:3:21|The enemy stronghold at a high position was quickly destroyed, with the precise ranging by [Cai Xingfu], the PLA's shells continuously destroying the enemy's firepower strongholds. In the end, the main force of the PLA successfully captured this area.
0:3:21|0:3:31|[Cai Xingfu], [Yao Zhe], and [Mei Yan] successfully evacuated from the rooftop. [Ma Baoshu] took out a piece of cake from his bag as they walked, and they each took a bite in turn before the screen faded to black.
0:3:40|0:3:49|[Cai Xingfu] returned to the camp of the People's Liberation Army.
0:3:58|0:4:0|The rookie glanced at [Cai Xingfu].
0:4:14|0:4:19|To minimize the damage to Tianjin city, precise strikes must be made.
0:4:24|0:4:29|The defense system in Tianjin, Chen Changjie spent 25 billion Faby compared to Jinzhou and Changchun.
0:4:41|0:4:51|In the Nanma Road prison, the political prisoners who were previously detained have all been transferred. Underground is an arsenal factory, with vehicles coming and going normally in recent days.
0:5:10|0:5:17|Four days away from the Tianjin headquarters, the soldiers in the camp were strengthening the defensive trenches while shouting loudly.
0:5:22|0:5:41|A group of main infantry soldiers are practicing their shooting skills on a scarecrow. The red flag in the camp is fluttering in the wind. On the other side, the flag of the Nationalist Army is planted on the Zhongzheng Bridge. A military medical truck follows closely behind a group of Nationalist infantry troops as they drive across the bridge. Sitting in the truck are [Cai Xingfu] and [Ma Baoshu].
0:5:49|0:5:56|Two Kuomintang soldiers immediately ran to the back of the truck, lifted the rear curtain, and found two soldiers covered in blood and flesh inside the truck, then they reported to their superior with relief.
0:6:0|0:6:22|The truck smoothly drove into the military camp, it was a harsh winter day with scattered snowflakes in the sky. [Ma Baoshu] was driving the truck, and he and [Cai Xingfu] saw many captured PLA soldiers along the camp road. Some were tied to lampposts, some were bound and kneeling on the steps, a heartbreaking sight.
0:6:25|0:6:50|The scene shifts, Nationalist Army Officer [Yao Zhe] puts his daughter on the boat. Many civilians are carrying luggage, rushing towards a ship at the port. [Yao Zhe] helps a little boy retrieve his trumpet, and the boy follows the crowd surging towards the ship at the port, with people scrambling to board.
0:6:51|0:7:17|In the high shout of [Yao Zhe], the ship was about to leave Tianjin Port, but before it had completely left, it suddenly capsized. [Yao Zhe] and his daughter were also separated, and the people on the ship fell into the water one after another. This is [Yao Zhe]'s memory. The commander of the Kuomintang military police battalion, Qian Zhuoqun, was shaving his beard in front of the mirror. [Yao Zhe] timidly walked into the room.
0:7:51|0:7:54|[Yao Zhe] quietly took the official seal on the table and stamped it on a pastry.
0:8:37|0:8:47|The two looked out the window, among the crowd of military officers' families outside, a little girl looked towards [Yao Zhe] in the house.
0:9:18|0:9:31|At the front table, someone put down their knife and fork. A young boy from the military officer's family ran to the quarantine border holding a ball.
0:9:37|0:9:43|[Yao Zhe] came out from the front desk and found the deputy officer of the military station, [Wan San]. [Wan San] handed the car keys to [Yao Zhe].
0:10:3|0:10:25|[Yao Zhe] handed the pastry with the seal to [Ma Baoshu], who nodded in acknowledgment. Then he quickly left. At night, by the hidden door on the second underground floor, a small iron ring slowly moved up from the gap in the window cover, pushing the latch to gradually open the window cover.
0:11:0|0:11:24|The secret door opened, [Yao Zhe] cautiously poked his head out, looked around, saw no one around, then quickly picked up his daughter and ran towards the back door. At this moment, a truck was parked on the empty street outside the back door. Meanwhile, in a tall building in the distance, [Cai Xingfu] and his comrades were observing all this through a telescope.
0:11:24|0:11:26|At this moment, [Yao Zhe] has entered a bar.
0:11:32|0:11:52|Yao Zhe walked towards the bar counter where Wan San was, while outside the bar, Cai Xingfu and Ma Baoshu had also driven there. Seeing nobody on the truck parked outside the main entrance of the bar, Cai Xingfu turned his head and glanced at the open Emi Bar, then walked in with Ma Baoshu.
0:11:52|0:11:57|In the bar, the owner of the bar quickly approached the two men disguised as military officers, [Cai Xingfu].
0:12:14|0:12:31|[Ma Baoshu] picked up the bottle and looked at it. [Cai Xingfu] calmly tapped [Ma Baoshu]'s bottle, indicating for him to drink. After taking a big sip, [Ma Baoshu] put down the bottle, gave a nod to [Cai Xingfu], and walked towards the door of the bar. The bar owner handed a cigarette to [Cai Xingfu], who took one.
0:13:10|0:13:18|Wan San took out a small notebook from his bag, which was the pass to leave Tianjin. He took the pass and was about to leave the restroom when he pulled out a gun.
0:13:47|0:14:9|[Yao Zhe] took the gun. After Wan San left, [Yao Zhe] held the gun for a long time, then walked out of the restroom. Sitting at the bar, [Cai Xingfu] noticed that [Yao Zhe] was about to leave the bar. As [Yao Zhe] walked out of the bar, intending to drive away, [Cai Xingfu] quickly left the bar and caught up.
0:14:16|0:14:41|[Cai Xingfu] grabs [Yao Zhe] and points a gun at him. [Ma Baoshu] appears behind [Yao Zhe] and ties his hands with a rope. [Yao Zhe]'s daughter peeks out from behind the car. [Ma Baoshu] swiftly throws a flying knife, hitting the soldier holding the gun directly. The soldier falls to the ground, pulling the trigger of the gun.
0:14:43|0:15:11|Standing on top of a tall building, Ermao and Xiaoge saw Cai Xingfu. The car was heading towards the border blockade zone, and the soldiers were alertly raising their guns towards the car. Yao Zhe, who was bound in the car, saw his pass fall on the street. The soldiers chasing behind the car were getting closer.
0:15:31|0:15:37|Three shells instantly destroyed the blockade in front of the car. [Cai Xingfu] drove the car out of the blockade at high speed.
0:15:45|0:16:8|On the other side, [Wan San] dialed [Qian Zhuoqun]'s phone. The scene shifted, a small car stopped at the entrance of the Victoria Nightclub, and a black man got out of the car and walked into the nightclub, looking for [Qian Zhuoqun] inside.
0:16:8|0:16:14|Qian Zhuoqun is leaning against the sofa, watching the dancer [Mei Yan] singing passionately on the stage with great interest.
0:16:47|0:16:53|The man in black flipped through a briefcase and handed a small leather bag to [Qian Zhuoqun].
0:17:42|0:17:51|Later, [Qian Zhuoqun] arrived at the backstage of the nightclub, where [Mei Yan] was sitting in front of the dressing table. [Qian Zhuoqun] took out a necklace from his bag and put it on her.
0:18:25|0:18:44|[Mei Yan] was not pleased. She touched her necklace, saw [Qian Zhuoqun] sitting on the sofa behind her in the mirror, reading a newspaper. After a moment of contemplation, [Mei Yan] slowly stood up, leaned against the table, quietly opened the drawer with both hands, and took out a gun.
0:18:49|0:19:1|She raised her gun with both hands, aiming at the back of [Qian Zhuoqun]'s head, quietly approaching. But when she pulled the trigger, she found that there were no bullets in the gun. It turned out that [Qian Zhuoqun] had already noticed.
0:19:45|0:20:11|[Mei Yan] angrily smashed the phonograph on the ground. Qian Zhuoqun immediately slapped [Mei Yan] back. Unwillingly, [Mei Yan] grabbed the scissors on the table and tried to stab Qian Zhuoqun, but she was quickly subdued.
0:20:13|0:20:21|A soldier came in and spoke to Qian Zhuoqun. After listening, Qian Zhuoqun continued to speak to [Mei Yan].
0:20:26|0:20:42|Qian Zhuoqun turned and left, asking someone to fix the camera. Later, Qian Zhuoqun rushed to the scene on Nanma Road where he found [Yao Zhe]'s ID on the ground. The military police mortar platoon leader Li Bing was leading the inspection at the scene.
0:21:16|0:21:31|At the same time, [Yao Zhe] and his daughter were tied up and gagged in the attic of a clock tower. This was a gun position of the PLA artillery reconnaissance company. [Ma Baoshu] ran up to the attic, bringing some water to feed Yao Zhe's daughter Xiao Lan. [Cai Xingfu] removed the cloth gag from Yao Zhe's mouth.
0:22:34|0:22:42|[Ma Baoshu] dragged [Cai Xingfu] to the attic platform, where Xiao Ge and Er Mao were adjusting the artillery equipment.
0:23:5|0:23:7|Cai Xingfu looked over suspiciously.
0:23:11|0:23:26|A shell exploded towards the platform in an instant, and Ermao was blown out, hanging on the pole next to the building. [Li Bing] was on a high building in the distance, smugly watching [Cai Xingfu] through a telescope, trying to use a gun to pull Ermao back into the building. However, Ermao couldn't reach the gun, and the military police were on their way here.
0:23:44|0:23:52|The police rushed to the scene upon hearing the noise, and [Cai Xingfu], along with the other two, quickly ran back to the attic. The police had already arrived inside the building.
0:24:7|0:24:26|[Ma Baoshu] dragged [Yao Zhe], with Xiao Ge bringing up the rear, the three of them crossed from the rooftop platform to the other side of the building, where there was a tram station below.
0:24:29|0:24:47|[Cai Xingfu] placed the child on the ground and went with [Ma Baoshu] to search for advantageous escape points around the tram. At that moment, a chubby boy popped his head out from the manhole next to [Yao Zhe]. [Ma Baoshu] rushed over, lifted the manhole cover, and quickly followed the chubby boy down the manhole.
0:24:47|0:24:53|[Yao Zhe], Xiao Lan, and others followed down, while the pursuing constables also arrived at this building, descending the stairs and closing in.
0:25:0|0:25:5|As the military forces were about to reach the building, [Cai Xingfu] was the last one to crawl into the manhole and close the cover.
0:25:27|0:25:36|Under the manhole cover lies a different world, where a little girl in Western clothes is playing with the birds in the cage. Xiao Lan walks over curiously.
0:26:51|0:26:56|[Cai Xingfu] used a knife to cut the rope binding [Yao Zhe]'s hands.
0:27:8|0:27:11|[Yao Zhe] kissed Xiaolan on the forehead, then turned to ask Xiaowuzi.
0:27:15|0:27:17|[Cai Xingfu] pulled [Yao Zhe] aside.
0:27:50|0:28:9|[Cai Xingfu] snatched the ring from [Yao Zhe] and handed it to Xiao Wuzi. Xiao Wuzi held up the oil lamp to lead the way, with [Yao Zhe] carrying his daughter and [Cai Xingfu] following behind.
0:28:15|0:28:17|[Cai Xingfu] hesitantly puts down the gun.
0:28:27|0:28:31|Taking advantage of the chaos, [Cai Xingfu] walked ahead, holding Xiao Lan's arm, signaling [Yao Zhe] to take a step and talk.
0:28:49|0:29:10|Xiao Lan took out a small roll of gold from her clothes and handed it to Xiao Wuzi, exchanging it for her father's ring. Then Xiao Wuzi led the group to continue walking from the sewer towards the gendarmerie headquarters. By this time, it was already dark outside, and a manhole cover on the street was slowly lifted up. It was Xiao Wuzi, crawling out from the sewer.
0:29:10|0:29:17|Next up is Cai Xingfu, after climbing up to the ground, he also carried Xiao Lan out from behind, and pulled Yao Zhe out from the sewer.
0:29:33|0:29:46|Intentionally pointing to the dimly lit street in the distance, [Cai Xingfu] and the other two approached to take a look. [Yao Zhe], holding his daughter Xiaolan, sneaked back into the sewer under the cover of Xiaowuzi's big teeth.
0:29:46|0:29:56|As they shouted and dodged, [Cai Xingfu] and the others realized that [Yao Zhe] had already closed the manhole cover. [Cai Xingfu] and the others had to abandon [Yao Zhe] and quickly retreat to a hidden location.
0:30:10|0:30:27|[Yao Zhe] quietly lifted the manhole cover and peeked out. Xiao Wuzi brought [Yao Zhe] to the nightclub where [Mei Yan] was, and [Yao Zhe] was making a phone call.
0:30:32|0:30:37|Upon hearing Qian Zhuoqun's voice, [Yao Zhe] quickly hung up the phone.
0:31:0|0:31:20|[Cai Xingfu], [Ma Baoshu], and others also arrived at the Vigoletti nightclub. As soon as they entered the nightclub, they saw two little kids, Xiao Wuzi and Da Baoya, watching the song and dance performance of sister [Mei Yan]. [Cai Xingfu] stepped forward and grabbed Xiao Wuzi by the collar.
0:31:24|0:31:39|From a distance, [Yao Zhe] quickly picked up his daughter and ran to the second floor to hide from [Cai Xingfu]. Alert, [Cai Xingfu] swiftly put down Xiao Wuzi and chased after them. On the second floor, [Yao Zhe] tried to open a room to hide, but either the room couldn't be opened or there was someone inside.
0:31:39|0:31:44|Suddenly, [Ma Baoshu] pointed a gun at [Yao Zhe]'s head, [Cai Xingfu] also arrived and pressed [Yao Zhe] against the wall.
0:31:45|0:31:51|At this moment, Xiao Ge and [Miss Three] who were looking outside the nightclub saw Qian Zhuoqun arriving at the nightclub with the military police.
0:32:14|0:32:33|Cai Xingfu and Yao Zhe were pressing forward downstairs. Yao Zhe saw the group in front entering the lobby of Mr. Ye's club, quickly pulled up his daughter, and tried to hide back. The group in front saw Cai Xingfu heading upstairs.
0:32:36|0:32:58|[Cai Xingfu] calmly turned around, walked downstairs, approached Qian Zhuoqun, while [Ma Baoshu] had already taken [Yao Zhe] and his daughter to hide on the second floor. [Cai Xingfu] opened his jacket, took out his credentials and handed them to Qian Zhuoqun, who opened them.
0:33:7|0:33:12|Mei Yan gave a wink to Cai Xingfu.
0:33:42|0:33:51|[Cai Xingfu] turned around, Qian Zhuoqun waved his hand, and two military police officers dragged Ermao in front of [Cai Xingfu]. [Cai Xingfu] saw that Ermao's face was covered in blood at this moment.
0:34:2|0:34:13|[Cai Xingfu] suppressed his anger and looked calmly at Ermao. The military police pulled Ermao's hair, forcing him to lift his head and show his face to [Cai Xingfu].
0:34:48|0:35:5|Uncle Ma Baoshu looked at the dying Yao Zhe and suddenly shouted. He pressed Yao Zhe to come down from the second floor. Cai Xingfu quickly raised his gun at Qian Zhuoqun, while a group of soldiers also aimed their guns at Cai Xingfu. Qian Zhuoqun slowly took out his own pistol and aimed it at Cai Xingfu, leading to a tense standoff.
0:35:5|0:35:15|Suddenly, [Er Mao] looked up and signaled to [Cai Xingfu]. Taking advantage of the inattention of the guards on both sides, he quickly stood up, grabbed a grenade from one of the guards, pulled the pin, and detonated it on the spot.
0:35:19|0:35:32|[Ermiao] sacrificed himself. Taking advantage of the chaos, [Cai Xingfu] and [Ma Baoshu] quickly flipped over and hid as the military police opened fire. In the confusion, [Yao Zhe] also took cover, but he got separated from his daughter [Xiaolan].
0:35:38|0:35:46|[Yao Zhe] squats in a hidden spot searching for his daughter. [Xiao Lan] sees a woman being shot down by the military police, making her even more scared as she crawls on the ground.
0:35:50|0:35:59|[Cai Xingfu] and [Ma Baoshu] are hiding behind the bar counter, fighting against the military police, but their firepower is no match for the military police.
0:35:59|0:36:19|Suddenly, a jeep crashed through the windows of the Ye Mansion and headed straight for the lobby. Several people on the car were holding machine guns, shooting at the military police. This was when [Cao Chunsheng] and his comrades from the Tianjin underground party arrived to rescue [Cai Xingfu]. [Cao Chunsheng] got out of the car and handed a rifle to [Cai Xingfu].
0:36:26|0:36:43|[Ma Baoshu] quickly went to find [Yao Zhe], grabbing him by the back of his neck, intending to drag him away. At that moment, [Yao Zhe] happened to see his daughter [Xiao Lan] not far away, covering her ears and screaming desperately.
0:36:46|0:37:5|Yao Zhe tried to break free from Ma Baoshu, but in the gunfire from the military police, he couldn't spare a thought to save his daughter. Taiqing Prefecture and others dragged Yao Zhe towards the back door for retreat, Mei Yan also put on clothes, took Little Wuzi, Big Baoya, and two younger brothers, and retreated from the back door with the People's Liberation Army.
0:37:7|0:37:26|With the gunfire from the soldiers subsided, Qian Zhuoqun followed the sound of a girl crying. [Xiao Lan] was hiding behind a table, covering her ears. She stared in fear as Qian Zhuoqun approached, reaching out to her with a sinister smile. Meanwhile, a group pushed towards the back door was still being chased by the soldiers, desperately trying to rescue their daughter.
0:37:26|0:37:43|[Ma Baoshu] dragged [Mei Yan] forward. The platoon leader of the military police mortar, Li Bing, was on a high building using binoculars to observe the movements and positions of the retreating group. Xiao Ge and Miss San, who were guarding outside Ye's club, brought a burning cart to block the pursuing military police, but suddenly, a shell came flying towards the group.
0:37:56|0:38:16|A group of people hid in the corner of a high-rise building in the blind spot of the ceremonial guards. Xiao Wuzi pulled open a manhole cover next to him, and one by one, the group crawled into the manhole. As a shell from the guards exploded in the direction of the group, Da Baoya was the last one to crawl in.
0:38:22|0:38:39|Ma Baoshu was speaking when suddenly he stopped in his tracks and collapsed to the ground. A bullet had hit his stomach, blood gushing out.
0:39:12|0:39:22|[Cai Xingfu] carried Da Bao's teeth and the group retreated in difficulty. Although they temporarily escaped the pursuit of the military police in the end, Da Bao still died.
0:39:22|0:39:38|[Cai Xingfu] drove a truck, carrying [Mei Yan] and a group of people back to the underground party's base. [Mei Yan] held the body of Ma Baoshu, sadly picked up the birdcage next to her, took out the little bird inside, and reached out through the curtain at the back of the car.
0:39:43|0:40:2|The little bird flew from [Mei Yan]'s hand into the sky. Back at the base, [Cai Xingfu] angrily dragged [Yao Zhe] into the room.
0:41:0|0:41:7|Yao Zhe grabbed the gun held by [Cai Xingfu] and pressed it against his own forehead. [Cai Xingfu] slowly lowered the hand holding the gun.
0:41:46|0:41:50|[Yao Zhe], who had already walked out with a gun, came back.
0:42:35|0:42:54|The scene shifts, Cao Chunsheng enters Wanji Candy Store, pushes the door open, and sees the female boss packing candy for a customer. After the customer leaves, Cao Chunsheng casually picks up a box of candy and hands it to the boss, who is actually a member of the underground Communist Party, He Xiuping, and also the wife of [Cai Xingfu].
0:42:54|0:43:1|Cao Chunsheng handed money to Xiuping, with a piece of paper hidden among the bills, which contained information for Xiuping to report to the higher-ups.
0:43:10|0:43:29|Xiuping said nothing, after wrapping the candy, she quickly walked to the glass window of the candy store, and saw her husband [Cai Xingfu] standing across the street. At this moment, [Cai Xingfu] also saw Xiuping through the glass window, and the two of them gazed deeply at each other for a long time.
0:43:35|0:44:0|At night, Xiu Ping arrived at the storage room of the candy store, carefully opened the cabinet filled with candies and pastries, took out a telegraph machine from behind the cabinet, and reported to the superiors about Qian Zhuoqun's plot to sabotage the peace talks in Beiping based on the information brought by Cao Chunsheng during the day. On the other side, the underground party's base.
0:45:10|0:45:34|Yao Zhe got off the car, Cai Xingfu gestured to his comrades after getting off the car, they split up and searched for ambush points, then walked into a warehouse with Yao Zhe. Inside the warehouse, piles of materials were covered with cloth. Yao Zhe lifted the covering cloth, Cai Xingfu opened the wooden box containing packaged weapons, and took out a new-style machine gun.
0:45:40|0:46:3|Yaotie took out a packaged hand grenade, then [Cai Xingfu] began to carefully deploy the explosive devices. At this moment, the leader of the military police mortar platoon, Li Bing, had already led his team to drive to the abandoned factory. They got off the car, looked around, and walked towards a building. [Ma Baoshu] led Xiao Ge and others to quickly follow.
0:46:5|0:46:15|Several people walked while holding guns, observing the surroundings. They climbed to the second floor and proceeded cautiously.
0:46:22|0:46:41|As they approached a staircase leading downwards, Xiao Ge was about to take a step when [Ma Baoshu] promptly stopped him. It turned out that there was a tripwire on this staircase, which was a hidden trap. [Ma Baoshu] took out pliers and removed the trap, while on the other side, [Cai Xingfu] was still adjusting the detonator for the explosives.
0:46:50|0:46:52|Qian Zhuoqun and his team arrived at the abandoned factory.
0:47:14|0:47:24|Qian Zhuoqun has arrived at the agreed location, and the military police quickly got off the car and deployed in formation. Cai Xingfu and his team ran out of the warehouse, hiding in a concealed location to observe the situation.
0:48:3|0:48:29|Qian Zhuoqun waved from behind, and a military policeman picked up Xiao Lan in the car and brought her to [Cai Xingfu]. Xiao Lan was tied with four hand grenades, with the grenade fuses being pulled by the military policeman holding Xiao Lan. [Yao Zhe], hiding in the dark, saw his daughter [Xiao Lan] carrying the hand grenades and angrily picked up the explosive device.
0:49:9|0:49:13|[Ma Baoshu] looked over and saw a hand grenade hanging right below the device.
0:49:29|0:49:51|The trap was triggered, and the gendarmerie hidden below the high-rise quickly sprung into action with intense firepower. Several plainclothes soldiers on the second floor struggled to defend themselves, and in the fierce battle, one soldier was shot dead and fell from the second floor. [Cai Xingfu] shot and killed the gendarme holding a hand grenade with the fuse lit on [Xiao Lan].
0:49:52|0:50:5|The two sides quickly engaged in battle, with [Mei Yan] rushing towards [Xiao Lan] and grabbing her before the others at the table could react, seeing [Mei Yan] holding the soul of the child, quickly pressing the detonator, but the explosives did not go off.
0:50:5|0:50:12|[Mei Yan] fell to the ground with a gun in her hand, and [Xiao Lan] also fell down. [Xiao Lan] got up in fear, covering her ears and running forward desperately.
0:50:23|0:50:31|The assailant at the front table quickly fired two shots towards [Xiao Lan]. Yao Zhe held the detonator and rushed out of the building, intending to save his daughter.
0:50:47|0:50:58|In the midst of gunfire, [Xiao Lan] was hit in the arm by a bullet, but she ignored the pain, desperately running towards her father, only to fall heavily to the ground and then struggle to get back up.
0:51:4|0:51:22|Father and daughter ran desperately towards each other, and finally [Yao Zhe] picked up his daughter and they quickly hid in a safe place. Cao Chunsheng ran from a hidden spot to support [Cai Xingfu], the firepower of the police was still fierce. At this moment, [Cai Xingfu] hiding behind a cover wall found it difficult to avoid the bullets from the many police officers.
0:51:30|0:51:42|[Cai Xingfu] opens the protective cover of a car and puts his daughter inside before starting the car. The military police are gradually closing in.
0:51:49|0:52:0|Yao Zhe looked at his daughter in the passenger seat, her face covered in ash, crying loudly because her arm was hit by a bullet. He then glanced at Cai Xingfu outside the car, hesitated, and started the truck.
0:52:0|0:52:9|Cai Xingfu under the car resisted the gunfire of the police. Before he could climb onto the car, the car was driven away by Yao Zhe. Cai Xingfu had to return to his original position to avoid the police firepower.
0:52:14|0:52:20|Driving with one hand, [Cai Xingfu] uses the other hand to help his daughter remove the grenade from her body and takes off his own scarf to bandage her.
0:52:29|0:52:47|At this moment, [Cai Xingfu] had run out of ammunition in the face of the enemy, making a final struggle in the corner. He picked up the detonator that had not been successfully activated, waiting for someone to enter the battlefield. A group of police officers were approaching the place where [Cai Xingfu] was hiding.
0:52:54|0:53:9|When [Cai Xingfu] was trying to activate the explosive device, he saw [Yao Zhe] driving a car, holding a gun, and turning back.
0:53:15|0:53:22|[Cai Xingfu] triggered the explosive device, and in an instant, the warehouse was engulfed in flames.
0:54:1|0:54:19|At this moment, the military police from two trucks have arrived at the unsealing military stronghold located in the Quanye Field. The military police have rushed into the building, and Xiuping and other underground party members who were about to go downstairs have also retreated one after another.
0:54:25|0:54:37|On the other side, [Cai Xingfu] was driving with [Yao Zhe], Xiaolan, [Ma Baoshu], and Xiaoge. [Ma Baoshu] sitting in the back of the car was shot in the abdomen. Xiaoge saw this and quickly asked him to use the medicine box to cover the wound and then use a bandage to wrap it up.
0:54:49|0:54:53|At that moment, Cao Chunsheng was still struggling to fight against the military police who had surrounded the stronghold.
0:55:12|0:55:32|On the other side, [Ma Baoshu] was driving the car, taking [Yao Zhe] and the woman to the small cargo ship, when someone stopped the car. [Yao Zhe] saw the wound on [Ma Baoshu]'s abdomen, blood was flowing non-stop, but [Ma Baoshu] still drove seriously, following the comrades leading the way ahead.
0:55:38|0:55:46|Suddenly, the trap was triggered, and the leading comrade was killed in the explosion. [Ma Baoshu] slammed on the brakes, touched his wound with his hand, and said.
0:56:5|0:56:29|In this way, [Ma Baoshu] with a determined look, vowed not to return, driving forward alone to pave the way for everyone. Every time [Ma Baoshu] drove a short distance, a portion of the bomb mechanism would detonate. Holding onto his wound, he struggled to drive forward, until the car was directly blown up by a bomb, and [Ma Baoshu] bravely sacrificed himself.
0:56:32|0:56:53|Yao Zhe held his daughter, sitting on the ground, watching Ma Baoshu's departure direction for a long time. On the other side, Cai Xingfu had just driven to the entrance of the ticket industry's stronghold, and an exhaust cannon exploded directly towards here. The front table group on the high-rise saw this and slapped the nearby guard.
0:56:53|0:56:55|[Cai Xingfu] hurriedly rushed into the ruins of the stronghold.
0:56:59|0:57:14|The people in the ruins gathered together, moving the destroyed bricks and stones to rescue their comrades in the ruins. [Mei Yan] and Miss Three were rescued, but [Cai Xingfu]'s wife Xiuping was injured in the abdomen by the explosion, barely clinging to life. [Cai Xingfu] picked up Xiuping.
0:57:36|0:57:53|Upon hearing that their son was found, Xiuping used all her remaining strength to smile at her husband in relief, but ultimately passed away in his arms, leaving [Cai Xingfu] devastated. At that moment, [Yao Zhe] arrived with their daughter in his arms.
0:58:19|0:58:29|[Cai Xingfu] took off his coat, holding his deceased wife, and led everyone to the cargo ship. On the ship.
0:58:36|0:58:45|Yao Zhe was still adding coal to the boiler regardless of everything, while the small fifth son was once again operating the ship. The warning indicator on the control panel was flashing.
0:58:48|0:59:1|[Mei Yan] sat on the deck with the dead embroidered bottle in her arms, while Xiao Ge sat with the children on the other side. [Cai Xingfu], as if not hearing [Yao Zhe]'s advice, still mechanically clipped the eyebrows for the boiler.
0:59:4|0:59:12|[Yao Zhe] ran to the deck, took a glance at the embroidered bottle lying peacefully in [Mei Yan]'s arms, then turned back to [Cai Xingfu] and said.
0:59:18|0:59:22|[Yao Zhe] pulled [Cai Xingfu] by the hand.
0:59:27|0:59:32|[Yao Zhe] helplessly let go of the hand, while [Cai Xingfu] continued to add coal desperately.
1:0:39|1:0:53|Xiao Lan suddenly ran over and pulled [Cai Xingfu] by the foot. [Cai Xingfu] looked at the tearful child in his eyes and stopped his hand that was about to strike. The bruised and swollen child sat down paralyzed, while Xiao Lan hugged her father tightly.
1:0:56|1:1:22|[Cai Xingfu] staggered to the deck where his deceased wife Xiuping lay. He knelt down, lifted her face, and then picked her up, holding her tightly while crying. Due to the war, the family of three could never reunite again, as the train was still moving rapidly.
1:1:23|1:1:30|The young lady who was originally looking at [Cai Xingfu] turned around unintentionally and looked towards the Haihe River.
1:1:44|1:1:49|Xiao Wuzi took out a trumpet from his bag, and [Cai Xingfu] quickly stepped forward to snatch the trumpet.
1:2:56|1:3:13|[Yao Zhe] watched as his daughter half-knelt down. There were too many people at the time, the situation was too chaotic, not even Xiao Lan was taken care of.
1:3:14|1:3:36|In the chaotic river of memories, Cai Xingfu was floating on the river pushing driftwood. Yao Zhe threw a lifebuoy to Xiaolan, but Xiaolan couldn't reach it. Yao Zhe kept throwing the lifebuoy out repeatedly.
1:3:41|1:3:48|In the end, with the help of Jiefang, Xiaolan drifted to [Yao Zhe] and was lifted up by Yao Zhe on the floating wood.
1:4:13|1:4:19|The charcoal fire under the boiler is burning more and more vigorously, and the meter pointer is off the scale.
1:4:42|1:5:5|The boiler exploded. Before everyone could react, [Cai Xingfu] jumped into the Haihe River as if he had gone mad. Seeing [Cai Xingfu] struggling in the river and gradually sinking, [Yao Zhe] quickly took off his gloves and jacket, then also jumped into the Haihe River.
1:5:5|1:5:7|The coast guards found their cargo ship by the shore.
1:5:18|1:5:27|Cai Xingfu raised the machine gun and fired at the gendarmes on the shore. The gendarmes quickly started shooting towards the boat.
1:5:33|1:5:49|People on the boat picked up lifebuoys and jumped into the river one after another. Amidst the gunfire from the gendarmerie on the shore, the paddle steamer suddenly exploded. In the flames, [Yao Zhe] swam towards the riverbed, and the liberated bugle sank into the river again and again. That's how [Yao Zhe] drowned in the Hai River at that time.
1:5:54|1:6:18|At this moment, Xiu Ping's body was gradually sinking to the bottom of the river, and [Cai Xingfu], who wanted to reunite with his wife and children in heaven, was also sinking to the bottom of the river without any struggle. Suddenly, Yao Zhe grabbed her collar with one hand and pulled her towards the surface of the river, while Ma Baoshu sank forever to the bottom of the river.
1:6:25|1:6:53|[Yao Zhe] pulled [Cai Xingfu] up to the shore, breathing heavily. [Cai Xingfu] spat out some water and slowly regained his composure. Ignoring [Yao Zhe]'s support, he staggered towards the shore, while [Mei Yan] also struggled to climb up the other side of the river.
1:6:59|1:7:11|Suddenly, the gun was pointed at his head. [Cai Xingfu] picked up some firearms and ammunition from the dead constable on the shore. Cao Chunsheng and Xiao Ge also successfully landed with the children and found [Cai Xingfu].
1:7:23|1:7:42|[Cai Xingfu] was about to load the gun when Cao Chunsheng took out the bullets from his own body and handed them to [Cai Xingfu], then he picked up Xiao Lan and ran away with the other children. [Cai Xingfu] looked resolutely at their departing figures. Holding the gun, [Cai Xingfu] saw three military police not far away, their brows furrowed.
1:7:42|1:7:51|[Cai Xingfu] quickly raised his gun and fired, but as soon as the bullet was shot, it alerted the surrounding guards. Multiple bullets were shot in [Cai Xingfu]'s direction.
1:7:52|1:8:7|[Cai Xingfu] kept dodging, while [Yao Zhe] clumsily held a gun and followed behind [Cai Xingfu]. While shooting forward, [Cai Xingfu] advanced agilely, although he killed many police officers, he was eventually knocked unconscious by the police officers who rushed in from all sides.
1:8:7|1:8:16|Yao Zhe, who had been holding a gun but hesitated to shoot, saw Cai Xingfu being dragged away by a group of military police.
1:8:25|1:8:35|The People's Liberation Army soldiers under the command of the Chief Engineer have already tested the tank shells, while at this moment, coal flames are hanging from the roof in front of the Military Police Headquarters, with [Cai Xingfu] bound up.
1:8:54|1:8:58|The artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army attacking Tianjin has begun.
1:9:2|1:9:7|Qian Zhuoqun pressed the mechanism to load the bullet. The fan behind [Mei Yan] was turned on.
1:9:13|1:9:21|Cai Xingfu took a bite of the peach. Cai Xingfu threw the peach towards the fan. The peach was instantly shredded.
1:9:26|1:9:45|[Cai Xingfu] is tied to a chair, with a wire around his neck. At the other end of the wire is a trigger device connected to a handgun, which is aimed at [Cai Xingfu]'s forehead. If he relaxes his head, the mechanism will drive a metal rod to pull the trigger of the gun.
1:9:45|1:9:48|And [Mei Yan], who was hanging on the roof, was also sucked into the fan and killed.
1:9:52|1:9:59|Yao Zhe had Wan San tied up and brought him to the entrance of the building where [Cai Xingfu] and [Mei Yan] were detained. [Mei Yan]'s hair was getting closer and closer to Gu Fengji.
1:10:21|1:10:24|The squad leader of the military police stopped Yao Zhe and Ma Baoshu.
1:10:47|1:11:5|Wan San opened his coat to reveal a body full of explosives. The squad leader hadn't reacted yet. Before the squad leader could react, Wan San grabbed him by the neck. At this moment, Mei Yan's hair was almost caught in the fan. Cai Xingfu was also desperately supporting. Wan San brought the squad leader into the room and quickly strangled him to death on the ground.
1:11:7|1:11:28|[Mei Yan] is on the verge of collapse, [Cai Xingfu] and [Mei Yan] are hanging by a thread. [Yao Zhe] pushes [Ma Baoshu] into a small house, where two military police are preparing explosives. [Ma Baoshu] once again opens his coat, showing the two military police his body covered in explosives.
1:11:28|1:11:34|[Yao Zhe] picked up the rifle of the gendarme and knocked out the two men, then tied the gendarme to the iron railing with [Ma Baoshu].
1:11:40|1:11:49|Yao Zhe quickly knocked out Ma Baoshu with the gun barrel, then ran towards the basement where Mei Yan and Cai Xingfu were detained, along with the Beiping military officers.
1:11:58|1:12:9|Yao Zhe quickly went to pull the circuit breaker, stopping the blower, and then used a knife to cut the ropes binding [Cai Xingfu] and [Mei Yan]. [Mei Yan] fell from the roof, and Yao Zhe rushed up to catch [Mei Yan].
1:12:9|1:12:27|Later, Yao Zhe attempted to use the gun barrel to break the iron gate lock of the detained military dependents. After several unsuccessful attempts, Yao Zhe raised the gun and the lock was opened, saving the family members. Outside, the accurate artillery fire from the Liberation Army penetrated multiple shooting points of the military police.
1:12:36|1:12:47|Cai Xingfu led several military police officers outside the command post, with the officers adjusting the bomb detonator. Yao Zhe gazed ahead, waiting for the right moment.
1:13:16|1:13:24|Military dependents quickly rushed together to the wall, searching for a hidden door. The People's Liberation Army's artillery fire had already struck the location where Qian Zhuoqun was.
1:13:43|1:13:48|[Yao Zhe] opens his coat, revealing explosives strapped to his body. [Cai Xingfu] grabs a bundle and throws the explosives into the wall.
1:13:56|1:14:13|The explosives quickly blew open the wall, revealing a sealed iron door. Outside, the gunfire from the People's Liberation Army had passed. Qian Zhuoqun lay on the ground, gradually regaining consciousness, looking around to see a scene of devastation.
1:14:24|1:14:45|Suddenly, he saw the military police officer who was about to detonate the explosives at the command post lying dead not far away, so he quickly ran over. He pushed aside the body of the military police officer, grabbed the explosives, and glared fiercely at the command post. At that moment, inside the command post, everyone had already passed through the secret door.
1:14:52|1:14:54|Qian Zhuoqun presses the explosive device.
1:15:0|1:15:18|Explosives in every room of the headquarters were ignited one by one, causing a chain explosion. Although everyone in the headquarters had already hidden in the underground secret door, the powerful force of the bombs destroyed the building, causing debris to fall down from above.
1:15:18|1:15:26|[Cai Xingfu] and [Yao Zhe] are leading the military dependents through a dark passageway, when suddenly a large pile of rocks blocks the path ahead.
1:15:32|1:15:58|A large pile of rocks blocked the path for everyone to retreat. Everyone was trapped in the narrow passage between the rocks, with no way to escape. The soldiers, young and old, men and women, crouched on the ground, holding their heads to protect themselves from any rocks falling from above. Gradually, the sound of explosions subsided.
1:16:9|1:16:34|[Yao Zhe] looked up and saw a faint light coming in from above. [Yao Zhe] slowly stood up and said to [Cai Xingfu]. [Yao Zhe] tried to climb up to the exit, gradually pushing aside the rubble at the exit above.
1:16:38|1:16:56|Cai Xingfu rushed to the command post that was exploding. He continued to run forward, but the explosives in the room kept being ignited, causing him to be knocked down by the shockwave of the explosives. Yao Zhe escaped through the narrow exit hole that was pushed open.
1:17:49|1:18:5|One by one, they were pulled out from the small hole at the exit. At this moment on the Zhongzheng Bridge, the military police officers who were dodging the gunfire from the People's Liberation Army gradually stood up as the gunfire ceased. Meanwhile, the PLA soldiers were hidden behind advancing tanks, launching an attack towards the defense line of the military police at the Zhongzheng Bridge.
1:18:18|1:18:40|[Yao Zhe] and [Cai Xingfu] have successfully escaped from the dangerous headquarters with their military dependents. What should this large group of people do next? The main force has reached Zhongzheng Bridge. Hang in there, let's meet at the Rosebrugh Department Store. With [Cai Xingfu] leading the way, the military dependents follow behind. [Cai Xingfu] raises his hand, signaling everyone to stop.
1:18:40|1:19:0|[Cai Xingfu] peeked out from behind a hidden wall and saw a squad of military police approaching from a distance. He quickly ducked behind a sandbag barrier on the side of the street. The military police hurriedly ran past him, while [Yao Zhe] and [Mei Yan] looked around cautiously in all directions.
1:19:11|1:19:18|Everyone had to run from their hiding spots towards the tram at the rendezvous point. [Mei Yan] and the military dependents helped each other cross the street.
1:19:26|1:19:33|The guards on the rooftop are watching through binoculars as [Cai Xingfu] carefully leads the military dependents towards the tram.
1:19:50|1:20:4|[Cai Xingfu] saw the gunners on the tall building and hurried to the platform with Cao Chunsheng and Xiao Ge. After observing for a while, [Cai Xingfu] noticed there were four constitutional guards on one side and two on the other.
1:20:4|1:20:12|He gestured to Cao Chunsheng and Xiao Ge behind him, indicating the number of military police. He locked eyes with Cao Chunsheng and then the two quickly attacked the six artillerymen.
1:20:16|1:20:34|Six artillerymen were knocked down before they could react. [Cai Xingfu] took two artillery shells and artillery equipment, while Xiao Ge took a high-quality artillery rifle, and they quickly retreated. [Cai Xingfu] fired two shots at the loft on the platform, causing the ceremonial guards inside to run out in a panic.
1:20:41|1:21:0|Li Bing suddenly ran crazily on the rooftop of a high-rise building. [Cai Xingfu] saw that shooting with a gun couldn't lock onto a moving target, so he switched to using a mortar. He picked up a mortar, loaded it into the device's barrel, and aimed with his thumb at Li Bing's position and distance to the side. Li Bing ran forward in a panic, and [Cai Xingfu] estimated the distance and speed at which Li Bing was running.
1:21:0|1:21:8|Cai Xingfu calmly fired a shell and successfully hit Li Bing as he flipped over a pile of sandbag obstacles.
1:21:17|1:21:39|Later, [Cai Xingfu] led the military dependents onto the tram. [Yao Zhe] started the tram, while [Mei Yan], standing at the back of the carriage, watched as the tram moved along, looking at the chaotic and empty streets outside the window. [Cai Xingfu] and the others also stood inside the carriage, constantly observing the situation outside.
1:21:43|1:21:56|Suddenly, a car turned from another street into the street where the tram was located. In the midst of the ambush, [Cai Xingfu] quickly crouched down for cover, prompting [Yao Zhe] to lead three military police officers in pursuit.
1:22:0|1:22:20|[Cai Xingfu] saw the scared military dependent child next to him. In order to protect everyone's safety, he picked up his rifle, stood up, and shot at the pursuing car. The military dependent child saw a pool of blood left behind where [Cai Xingfu] had just crouched. At this moment, there was intense fighting on Zhongzheng Bridge.
1:22:20|1:22:25|On the defense line, a machine gun continuously fires at the advancing People's Liberation Army after hitting the tank.
1:22:28|1:22:33|With the advance of the attack, the medics quickly caught up and provided assistance to the injured soldiers.
1:22:50|1:23:10|On the other side, the machine gun of the military police is extremely powerful. [Cai Xingfu] and Xiao Ge quickly crouch down to avoid the dense bullets behind the carriage. [Cai Xingfu]'s abdomen has been hit by multiple bullets, and he no longer sticks his body out from the entrance in front of the tram, but follows the group shooting towards the back of the carriage.
1:23:10|1:23:15|The military police threw a grenade into the tram, and [Cai Xingfu] quickly rushed forward, using his body to shield the grenade.
1:23:19|1:23:21|Did not let the grenade injure the others in the car.
1:23:26|1:23:29|[Cao Chunsheng] sacrificed heroically.
1:23:29|1:23:47|Witnessing the sacrifice of his comrade once again, [Cai Xingfu] stood up with determination, grabbed the machine gun in his hand, and started shooting at [Qian Zhuoqun] who had been following them all along. Each bullet contained hidden anger, and all the soldiers in [Qian Zhuoqun]'s car were taken down by [Cai Xingfu], leaving only [Qian Zhuoqun] himself, who picked up a machine gun and jumped out of the car.
1:23:47|1:23:54|The car crashed into the slowly moving tram, [Yao Zhe] and [Cai Xingfu] turned around, the tram was about to collide with the debris ahead.
1:24:1|1:24:18|Under the violent impact, the entire tram overturned. Meanwhile, on the Zhongzheng Bridge, the People's Liberation Army advanced like a raging tide. Two PLA tanks formed a strong offensive defense, continuously advancing. The PLA was about to capture the Zhongzheng Bridge and advance into the city.
1:24:35|1:24:58|On this side, [Cai Xingfu] is helping military dependents climb out of the tram. He first takes the children out of the tram, then goes to rescue the women and elderly trapped inside. [Cai Xingfu] rushes to the back of the tram, where [Mei Yan] and some military dependents are trapped in the carriage. [Cai Xingfu] uses a gun to break the glass of the carriage.
1:25:12|1:25:26|Xiao Ge went to find the observation point, and [Qian Zhuoqun], who had jumped off the car before, gradually regained consciousness. He got up from the ground and saw [Cai Xingfu] leading all the military dependents fleeing into the building of Zhongyuan Department Store.
1:25:40|1:25:57|The People's Liberation Army has successfully captured Zhongzheng Bridge, and the main force continues to advance towards the city. However, the firepower of the military police on the high-rise buildings in the city cannot be underestimated. At this moment, inside Zhongyuan Department Store.
1:25:59|1:26:22|The crowd looked back and saw an armored tank approaching Zhongyuan Department Store, with the fierce [Qian Zhuoqun] standing on top of it. He menacingly smiled at the crowd, grabbed the machine gun on the tank, and fired bullets. After [Qian Zhuoqun] emptied the magazine, the glass door of Zhongyuan Department Store shattered and fell.
1:26:31|1:26:45|The explosion of a tank shell instantly blew open the door of Zhongyuan Department Store. The guy at the observation point above the high-rise saw Cai Xingfu quickly fire a shell in his direction. Cai Xingfu cleverly hid inside the tank, inside the department store.
1:27:1|1:27:15|[Mei Yan] took off her coat and picked up a little girl from the arms of an old lady. The tank in the front suddenly moved its cannon towards the direction of the high-rise building. The young man on the high-rise building didn't have time to hide before being directly killed by the explosion.
1:27:15|1:27:22|Witnessing the sacrifice of another comrade, [Cai Xingfu] angrily fires at the tank, which suddenly rushes towards the department store.
1:27:36|1:27:47|Tank broke through the building, provocatively shooting towards the military dependents hiding on the second floor, another shell blasted towards the second floor.
1:27:52|1:28:8|[Cai Xingfu] and [Yao Zhe] ran towards the other side. They saw the tank preparing to fire shells at the military dependents on the second floor. [Cai Xingfu] quickly fired a few shots at the tank, attracting the guards inside the tank and changing the direction of the attack. The tank indeed adjusted its direction and headed straight towards [Cai Xingfu] and the others.
1:28:12|1:28:31|The two hurriedly ran towards the hidden corner of the shelves, [Qian Zhuoqun] slightly peeked out from the tank to observe the direction of the attack, while the two hiding behind the shelves suddenly noticed that the tank's cannon muzzle was slowly appearing above them. They quickly continued to dodge forward, the tank pressed against the shelves, and the bullets fired by the tank also hit one of their arms.
1:28:31|1:28:34|The two finally made it to the bar.
1:28:40|1:29:1|[Tai Xingfu] grabbed a bottle of liquor from the bar, looked at [Yao Zhe], then got up, flipped over the bar, and ran to the other side to attract the attention of [Qian Zhuoqun] inside the tank. Meanwhile, [Yao Zhe] quickly grabbed several bottles of strong liquor from the bar, and looked towards a shelf displaying cheongsams.
1:29:1|1:29:5|[Yao Zhe] went to tear open the fabric of the cheongsam and stuffed the fabric into the mouth of the wine bottle.
1:29:9|1:29:27|On this side, [Cai Xingfu] who is responsible for luring [Qian Zhuoqun] can't hold on any longer. [Cai Xingfu] sits on the ground, presses the grenade in his hand, flashes and throws the grenade under the tank driven by [Qian Zhuoqun]. The tank is stopped by the explosion, but the tank's gun barrel is aiming at [Cai Xingfu] who has just stood up.
1:29:32|1:29:51|At this moment, Yao Zhe rushed over with a burning bottle of alcohol and quickly threw it into the tank's window, prompting Qian Zhuoqun inside the tank to crawl out. Just as Qian Zhuoqun poked his head out of the tank, Cai Xingfu raised his gun and shot, hitting Qian Zhuoqun and causing him to fall back into the tank.
1:29:59|1:30:12|The military police on the high building continued to fire fiercely, injuring the advancing People's Liberation Army soldiers with machine gun bullets. Two tanks of the PLA continued to move in parallel to provide cover, aiming their tank barrels at the shooting points of the military police on the high building.
1:30:24|1:30:40|Under the bombardment of several shells, the last defense point of the Xian Army was taken down. The People's Liberation Army smoothly advanced into the city, with a soldier waving a red flag running into the team and planting the flag on one side of the Zhongzheng Bridge. Tianjin City was finally captured.
1:30:47|1:31:3|At this moment, in the department store, [Cai Xingfu] and [Yao Zhe] walked slowly towards the second floor, expecting to celebrate their victory. A little girl suddenly pointed behind [Yao Zhe], and Qian Zhuoqun was still alive.
1:31:3|1:31:14|He was aiming his gun at the men on the second floor, with [Yao Zhe] strong and busy shielding them with his body, the bullet piercing [Yao Zhe]'s heart.
1:31:37|1:31:44|[Mei Yan] shoots at Qian Zhuoqun with a handgun. Qian Zhuoqun looks at [Mei Yan] in surprise as she walks down from the second floor with the gun raised.
1:31:54|1:32:12|[Mei Yan] decisively hit Qian Zhuoqun's abdomen and legs, causing him to kneel on the ground. [Mei Yan] then decisively fired a shot, hitting Qian Zhuoqun right in the forehead. Finally, [Mei Yan] personally killed Qian Zhuoqun.
1:32:19|1:32:34|The People's Liberation Army troops arrived at Zhongyuan Department Store just in time, and everyone was finally rescued. Meanwhile, [Yao Zhe], who was shot by Qian Zhuoqun, was barely clinging to life.
1:33:28|1:33:33|[Yao Zhe] apologized to [Cai Xingfu] with all his remaining strength.
1:33:50|1:34:8|Gradually, [Yao Zhe]'s eyes became unfocused, his breathing calmed down, and he stopped speaking, slowly passing away. [Cai Xingfu] cried, pounding his head against the wall beside him.
1:34:17|1:34:22|After the transition, [Cai Xingfu] pushed open the doors of the church and walked in.
1:34:53|1:35:14|[Cai Xingfu] carried Xiao Lan out of the church, with Miss Three following behind. The three of them walked out of the church, and Xiao Lan looked into the distance with confusion. At this moment, she still didn't know that her father had already gone to heaven. But [Yao Zhe], who bravely sacrificed himself, saving dozens of innocent lives, will always be remembered as a hero.
1:35:19|1:35:37|The movie scene takes us back to the establishment of New China, with the People's Liberation Army and the people driving cars, with banners saying "Long live the Chinese people" on the cars, and displaying the image of the great leader Chairman Mao. [Cai Xingfu] is carrying Xiao Lan and walking among the crowd, while Xiao Lan is also holding a small red flag.
1:35:37|1:35:41|They continued to walk forward with Mei Yan's youngest son and third daughter waiting for them on the roadside.
1:35:44|1:36:2|[Mei Yan] is also dressed in military uniform, and at this moment she is also a member of the People's Liberation Army. They are heading towards Tiananmen Square, and amidst the cheers of the people, the PLA troops are marching in neat formation past Tiananmen Square. [Cai Xingfu] seems to see a young PLA soldier in the crowd playing a trumpet.
1:36:24|1:36:41|Under the Tiananmen Gate Tower, there was a frenzy, with [Cai Xingfu] excitedly howling. Upon hearing this, Xiao Lan also joyfully began to howl.
1:36:51|1:37:2|The frozen frame captured this photo of the five celebrating the establishment of New China, behind this black and white photo is full of history and memories.
