0:4:16|0:4:29|A woman wearing sunglasses and a helmet is driving a motorcycle. This woman is called [Ding Xiaojia], also known as Sister Nail. Behind her are three black men riding motorcycles. Bullets are flying towards them, but Sister Nail manages to dodge one, causing her motorcycle to be hit.
0:5:1|0:5:16|She accelerated up the slope in front of her, smashing the road sign to pieces. The giant steel pipe, originally suspended high, fell due to the rope breaking. Ding Xiaojia was thrown off the motorcycle, and at the moment of separation between her and the motorcycle, the vehicle was hit by the falling steel pipe.
0:5:16|0:5:29|Ding Xiaojia rolled on the ground several times out of inertia, fell to the side, screaming in pain. As she was about to get up and leave, a taxi came towards her, and the driver opened the door.
0:5:31|0:5:40|A beautiful drift turn, with [Ding Xiaojia] wearing a helmet, her head getting stuck right under the steering wheel.
0:5:47|0:5:53|[Ding Xiaojia] struggled for a long time, and the driver [Q Sir] finally pushed [Ding Xiaojia] away.
0:7:6|0:7:12|Staring at the text message on the phone, [Ding Xiaojia] suddenly widened her eyes. A series of URLs in the message caught her attention.
0:7:17|0:7:23|[Q Sir] also glanced at the dropped phone and asked her. The two pulled over to the side of the road, and [Ding Xiaojia] picked up the phone.
0:7:32|0:7:39|After she sent a text message, she quickly received a reply. [Q Sir] turned around to look at the screen together.
0:7:53|0:8:3|[Ding Xiaojia] nodded, then received another text message with some numbers at the bottom.
0:8:7|0:8:31|[Q Sir] took a glance at the content on his phone, then drove away. The taxi pulled into a car wash shop on the roadside. As soon as the vehicle stopped, two workers approached. [Q Sir] walked towards the shop's storage room, checking the time on his watch. Passing employees nodded and greeted him. Walking through the shelves, [Q Sir] opened a metal door and entered the storage room.
0:8:32|0:8:41|In the storage room, there is a row of lockers, with a table and a chair next to it. Many posters are also posted on the wall, most of which are related to basketball and football.
0:8:41|0:9:1|[Q Sir] took off his coat and casually placed it on the chair. Then he used a key to open one of the lockers, took out a suit jacket from inside. He hung the hanger back, pressed a fingerprint button inside the locker, and a nearby locker opened, revealing a secret door. [Q Sir] took off the key, put on the jacket with only one sleeve.
0:9:1|0:9:19|Upon entering, he straightened his coat. After tidying up his collar, he walked to a mirror. The mirror immediately started working, matching his eyes and face. The mirror slowly opened, and [Q Sir], tugging at the hem of his suit, entered the Criminal Intelligence Division surveillance room.
0:9:48|0:10:7|That night, there was a crowd outside the Harbour Sky Hotel. [Ding Xiaojia], dressed in a gown and high heels, stepped out of a Maserati. As the driver closed the door, [Ding Xiaojia] elegantly walked forward, but her dress got caught in the door and ripped. [Q Sir] picked up the phone and called [Ding Xiaojia].
0:10:18|0:10:34|[Ding Xiaojia] walked up the stairs while holding her skirt, the outside of the window was pitch black in the night, making the lights in the hotel banquet hall particularly bright. People at the ceremony were busy toasting, some were discussing business. [Ding Xiaojia] weaved through the crowd, looking especially dignified and elegant.
0:10:52|0:11:2|On the top floor of the Dongyou Group's financial investment department building, the neon lights were dazzling. A truck drove into the parking lot, and the security guard directed the vehicle to enter. After the truck stopped,
0:11:11|0:11:14|Place the mysterious device in the control room.
0:11:21|0:11:30|During the opening ceremony, the helmeted figure activated a mysterious device and then left.
0:11:36|0:11:59|The mysterious device is rapidly counting down, [Qin Huanxi] strides onto the stage. As the countdown ends, just as [Qin Huanxi] steps onto the stage, all the surrounding light fixtures explode one after another. He lets out a scream and falls to the ground. [Q Sir] in the control room notices the anomaly, at the same time, water gushes out from the device in the control room, causing the equipment to get wet and short-circuit. The guests are frightened by the explosions and run around in panic.
0:12:2|0:12:9|In the darkened hall, someone accidentally knocked over a table, and on the stage, [Lin Dongyou] was taken away by two black men in the confusion.
0:12:11|0:12:37|[Lin Dongyou] was tied up with a strap, struggling hard. The men in black threw him to the ground. As he was about to sit up, one of them pointed a gun at his head. At that moment, a figure emerged from the darkness. [Lin Dongyou] knelt on the ground, while the man in black behind him moved closer, finger on the trigger. He swallowed hard.
0:12:40|0:13:10|The mysterious person pressed the red button, [Lin Dongyou] was suddenly pulled out of the window by a rope, falling down from the high building along with the glass. Then the mysterious person pressed a blue button, opening the parachute behind [Lin Dongyou], which had a poop pattern on it. The rope on [Lin Dongyou]'s back caught him, swinging him onto the glass of the building due to inertia.
0:13:10|0:13:14|The mysterious person gave a gesture to two men in black, and they left.
0:13:15|0:13:26|[Q Sir] was observing the surveillance from the monitoring vehicle, and he saw a mysterious figure on one of the screens. The mysterious person had a device with a safety rope on the rooftop, and [Lin Dongyou], who was suspended in mid-air, watched as the mysterious person slipped and struggled desperately in mid-air.
0:13:36|0:13:48|The driver is [Shao Zhilang], also known as Young Master. He made a left turn in his sports car and stopped at the side of the building. The mysterious person landed on the ground and then unhooked the rope that was suspending him, sitting in the passenger seat next to [Shao Zhilang].
0:13:57|0:14:6|The mysterious person in the passenger seat is A Lan, the good brother of Shao Zhilang. At this moment, Q Sir arrives at the main entrance of the hall and sees a sports car speeding past.
0:14:11|0:14:43|A rich second generation got out of his sports car, and [Q Sir] immediately drove off in the rich second generation's car to chase. The rich second generation and the security guard exchanged glances, [Shao Zhilang] glanced at the rearview mirror, [A Lan] glanced back, two police cars blocked the yellow Ferrari's path, [Shao Zhilang] drove through the middle.
0:14:53|0:15:11|[Shao Zhilang] made a beautiful detour and [Q Sir] followed closely behind. They drove onto a bridge one after the other. [Shao Zhilang] glanced at the rearview mirror, revealing a confident smile. [Q Sir] kept chasing, driving with one hand and showing very stable driving skills. As they chased each other, the distance between them got closer and closer.
0:15:11|0:15:23|[Q Sir] was driving while requesting backup on the radio. [Shao Zhilang] and [A Lan] remained calm, with [A Lan] even starting to chew gum.
0:15:27|0:15:49|[Shao Zhilang] suddenly changed lanes at a fork in the road, overtaking a large truck, catching [Q Sir] off guard. Unable to successfully change lanes, the two vehicles went their separate ways and entered a tunnel. [Shao Zhilang] gradually drove up behind the large truck, which lowered the door at the back of the cargo area, creating a bridge for [Shao Zhilang]'s car. Seizing the opportunity, [Shao Zhilang] successfully entered the cargo area of the large truck.
0:15:49|0:16:13|Approaching the tunnel exit, the big truck closed its cargo door before exiting the tunnel. [Q Sir] rushed to the tunnel exit ahead of time, ready to intercept [Shao Zhilang].
0:16:14|0:16:31|He saw a large truck coming from behind in the rearview mirror, but there was no sign of [Shao Zhilang] or the car behind the truck. Awkwardly, he looked back and drove the car sideways to the tunnel exit.
0:16:48|0:16:55|[Shao Zhilang] is in his studio, riding a Segway, wearing headphones, and taking the coffee handed to him by his secretary.
0:17:37|0:18:8|Xiao Ying looked worried when she heard this. The three of them were dining in a luxurious private room in a restaurant. While Xiao Ying was on the phone, [A Lan] took the opportunity to add shrimp to her bowl without her noticing. Just as she did that, [Shao Zhilang] quickly took it away and added vegetables to Xiao Ying's bowl instead. [A Lan] gave Xiao Ying a provocative look and then added another dish to her bowl. Not backing down, [A Lan] continued to add more food. She picked up a bottle of toothpicks...
0:18:8|0:18:13|Two people hurriedly and clumsily stack the dishes into a pyramid shape,
0:18:25|0:18:35|Xiao Ying had just left her seat, [A Lan] and [Shao Zhilang] smirked and piled all the dishes from the plate into Xiao Ying's bowl.
0:18:37|0:18:48|After the meal, the three of them arrived in front of an office building by car. After [Shao Zhilang] and Xiaoying got off the car, they waited for a moment for [A Lan]. Just as the three were about to enter the meeting room, the security guard stopped [Shao Zhilang].
0:18:49|0:18:54|[A Lan] pushed the security guard, while [Shao Zhilang] stared at [A Lan] with an unpleasant smile on his face.
0:20:38|0:20:44|Chairman [Guo Ming] did not answer the phone until everyone in the meeting room had left, and then he slowly pressed the answer button.
0:21:12|0:21:28|Mr. Dong hung up the phone, at the same time, [Guo Ming] looked thoughtful after finishing the call. On the other side, [Shao Zhilang] played with a toy Superman while talking to [A Lan],
0:21:41|0:22:15|[A Lan] pressed a button in front of the office glass, and the frosted glass window became transparent. [Shao Zhilang] walked over and stood beside [A Lan] in front of the glass window, observing every move of everyone in the office area. The two stood side by side, pondering for a long time. [A Lan] placed one hand on [Shao Zhilang]'s shoulder and turned to look at the cabinet.
0:22:15|0:22:28|One of the toy Superman's arms fell off, he smiled, while [Q Sir] received a report from the police station. As a result, the board members of the Deloitte Group were taken to the police station for questioning.
0:23:55|0:24:3|[A Lan] looked out the two-way mirror, as [Q Sir] set down the food in his hand.
0:25:30|0:25:42|After the interrogation, [Shao Zhilang] received a call from [A Lan]. He arrived at Mei Ji Restaurant, opened the door and walked in. The place was pitch black, but as he walked inside, the lights suddenly turned on.
0:26:50|0:27:3|Wenwen shyly dodged Shao Zhilang's kiss, A Lan flicked the cigarette ash and asked back:
0:27:22|0:27:31|[A Lan] lowered her head in contemplation, then moved the chair she was sitting on forward and looked at [Shao Zhilang], saying:
0:28:24|0:28:40|[Shao Zhilang] pondered for a long time, then extinguished the cigarette in his hand. [A Lan] looked at [Shao Zhilang], who picked up the bottle of alcohol on the table and poured it into [A Lan]'s glass.
0:28:49|0:29:4|[A Lan] picked up a napkin from the table and started performing. [Shao Zhilang] supported his neck and watched intently. [A Lan] stuffed the napkin into his palm, clenched his fist, shook it forward three times, and extended his middle finger.
0:30:2|0:30:22|All the staff in the control room looked towards [Q Sir]. Before long, [Ding Xiaojia] arrived in Macau. She got out of the car in front of a luxurious hotel. After getting out of the car, she looked around and then walked to the pedestrian street, browsing through the shop windows.
0:31:10|0:31:30|In the swimming pool, handsome men and beautiful women are having a great time. At this moment, Ding Xiaojia receives a text message. She turns around and sees Shao Zhilang sitting on a lounge chair, taking out a tea bag from a teacup. Tea bag? You can even mistranslate tea bag and thong underwear.
0:31:31|0:31:48|[Shao Zhilang] looked at [Ding Xiaojia] with a smile. [Ding Xiaojia] hesitated, placed the drink in her hand aside, pretended to leave, then turned back, observing [Shao Zhilang] back and forth. She covered her mouth and chuckled.
0:31:49|0:32:7|She took a selfie on her phone, turned around, blinked, and walked towards [Shao Zhilang]. [Shao Zhilang] looked up at [Ding Xiaojia], who was getting closer and closer. She raised her leg high and turned sideways, [Shao Zhilang] leaned forward facing [Ding Xiaojia], who awkwardly stumbled.
0:32:7|0:32:15|[Shao Zhilang] took off his sunglasses, [Ding Xiaojia] frowned and looked back, only to see a long-haired beauty in a bikini sitting behind them.
0:32:17|0:32:36|[Ding Xiaojia] had a gloomy expression, burying her head in the seat cushion. [Shao Zhilang] walked straight towards the hot beauty and sent a text message to [Ding Xiaojia]. With a joyful expression, [Ding Xiaojia] arrived at the casino, ready to gamble at the table.
0:32:40|0:33:19|Standing up and looking around, [Shao Zhilang] is at a gambling table, tapping the chips in his hand on the table. [Ding Xiaojia] stares at his hand, translating [Shao Zhilang]'s code. [Q Sir] receives a message. Suddenly, [Ding Xiaojia] is bumped by two passersby. When she regains her senses, [Shao Zhilang] is nowhere to be seen. She quickly looks around and runs to search for the target. Suddenly, ...
0:33:19|0:33:25|Pulled over by a hand, [Shao Zhilang] pressed [Ding Xiaojia] against the wall with one hand against the wall, nowhere to escape.
0:33:29|0:33:44|His other hand suddenly wrapped around [Ding Xiaojia]'s waist, [Q Sir] looked away when he saw it, [Shao Zhilang] hooked [Ding Xiaojia]'s buttocks, [Ding Xiaojia] lifted her head.
0:34:0|0:34:6|She said, wrapping her hands around [Shao Zhilang]'s neck, while [Shao Zhilang] rhythmically patted her buttocks.
0:34:22|0:34:55|Ding Xiaojia straightened her dress and suddenly felt a card on her buttocks. She tore off the card, pushed Q Sir hard, and adjusted her bangs. Meanwhile, Shao Zhilang was smoking in the room when a beautiful woman walked in, twisted her waist, and immediately wrapped her arms around his neck. The woman pulled a steel wire from her hand and looped it around behind Shao Zhilang, then used it to strangle him. Shao Zhilang grabbed the wire with his hand, turned around, and pushed the woman away. The woman kicked him in the leg with her heel.
0:34:57|0:35:16|The beauty rode behind him, suddenly grabbed his eyes and mouth, [Shao Zhilang] spun around, and the two fell to the ground together. The beauty then delivered a flying kick, knocking down the chair that was coming towards her. She locked his neck from behind, and the two of them closed the door together, leaving Ding Xiaojia looking shocked.
0:35:16|0:35:31|As she was about to leave the corridor, [Shao Zhilang] and the beauty were fighting, blocking her way. When she tried to escape again, the two tangled figures accidentally knocked her away, and a large shield-like craftwork in the corridor was lifted and smashed on [Shao Zhilang]'s head.
0:35:31|0:36:6|The beautiful woman pressed [Shao Zhilang] against the corner, kicked Ding Jie away, then jumped on [Shao Zhilang]'s back and locked him. Ding Jie leaped and landed on the woman, causing all three to fall. [Shao Zhilang] took the opportunity to escape, while the woman got up and pulled out a pen with a long needle tip, ready to stab [Shao Zhilang]. However, Ding Jie grabbed her foot from the ground. [Shao Zhilang] pushed the woman away from behind, protecting Ding Jie underneath him. Seizing the moment when she fell, [Shao Zhilang] picked up Ding Jie and ran, but suddenly stumbled.
0:36:10|0:36:31|[Q Sir] patted the back of his belt and found no gun. The beauty let go of Ding Jie and ran away. [Q Sir] hurried to Ding Jie and helped her up. [Shao Zhilang] lay on the ground with his eyes closed. It was drizzling in Shenzhen. Under an office building, a bodyguard held an umbrella and opened the car door for [A Lan]. [A Lan], Xiaoying, and others were about to get in the car when several vans suddenly drove up and blocked them. Two bodyguards reacted to the situation.
0:36:31|0:36:55|Pulling out a small stick from his body, many masked men in black got off the car, holding machetes in their hands. Xiao Ying and a bodyguard quickly escorted [A Lan] away. One bodyguard fought with the men in black, while Xiao Ying walked quickly with [A Lan], holding her arm, to a passage in a building. Xiao Ying looked back from time to time, and seven men in black with knives were chasing after them. Xiao Ying stopped, turned around with a swinging stick, and shielded [A Lan] behind her.
0:36:57|0:37:16|After saying that, Xiao Ying rushed forward with a stick. [A Lan] looked at Xiao Ying from a distance for a while, then turned and walked away. He took a few steps, leaned against the wall, took out a cigarette, and watched Xiao Ying fighting bravely for himself while covered in blood. Facing five or six enemies alone, Xiao Ying showed no fear at all. With just a few spins, she made several people scream in pain.
0:37:16|0:37:41|[A Lan] quietly smoked and watched Xiao Ying. At this moment, Xiao Ying pushed one of the black-clothed men to the corner, while the other black-clothed man took advantage of her distraction and cut her back with a knife. [A Lan] threw away the cigarette in her hand, picked up the baton on the ground, and knocked out the black-clothed man who was fighting with Xiao Ying with one strike. Xiao Ying breathed a sigh of relief, and [A Lan] walked forward to beat up the black-clothed man on the ground.
0:37:41|0:38:2|A man in black stood up to resist, [A Lan] fiercely struck his head. Xiaoying limped over to [A Lan], grabbed his arm, and walked away quickly. [A Lan] even took the time to straighten his suit, looking at the injured Xiaoying. He hung Xiaoying's hand on his shoulder, left with a serious expression. Xiaoying came to sew up the wound on his back.
0:38:2|0:38:24|A pair of gloved hands, using cold forceps and scissors carefully stitched up Xiao Ying, whose back was covered with bullet marks and scars. After Xiao Ying finished treating the wound, [A Lan] turned around and looked at the others, placing three thick rolls of banknotes on the table.
0:38:34|0:38:49|Xiaoying and the bodyguard with scars on his face looked at [A Lan]. [A Lan] met the determined gazes of the others, pondered for a moment, nodded, and then turned and left.
0:38:52|0:39:5|Three people lowered their heads. In the intelligence department's work area, everyone was busy at their desks, with [Q Sir] sitting in his office making a phone call to Ding Xiaojia.
0:40:1|0:40:29|[A Lan] was driving with [Shao Zhilang], who asked: The two exchanged a glance, but [A Lan] didn't answer, focusing on driving instead. [Shao Zhilang] looked out the window and said: The two arrived at an unfinished building, dark inside. They looked around and walked forward. [Guo Ming] and the bodyguards were already waiting there. [Guo Ming] was sitting on a box.
0:40:29|0:40:45|With a smile on his face, [Shao Zhilang] took the initiative to ask as he watched two people approaching. [Guo Ming] glanced to the right, and the two followed his gaze. [A Lan] patted [Shao Zhilang] on the shoulder, they exchanged a glance, and then walked off to the side.
0:40:45|0:41:14|In the dark, [A Lan] gently pushed [Shao Zhilang] forward from behind. [Guo Ming] gave a signal to his men, and the lights in the room turned on. [Shao Zhilang] took a few deep breaths, and what he saw in front of him was Ding Jie covered in blood, lying motionless on the ground inside a large plastic bag. Suddenly, she took a big breath. [Shao Zhilang] pursed his lips, lowered his head, while [A Lan] stood on the side, watching his every move.
0:41:21|0:41:36|A Lan tore open the plastic bag on her body and pinched her face. [Shao Zhilang] took the phone handed to him by the bodyguard, while [Q Sir] behind him inserted his hands into his pockets and glanced sideways at the bodyguards on both sides.
0:41:36|0:41:43|[A Lan] opened Ding Jie's phone and saw a message with a Kangxi cipher. He placed the message in front of Ding Jie and asked:
0:42:14|0:42:21|[A Lan] slapped Ding Xiaojia in the face.
0:42:32|0:42:47|[A Lan] stood up and turned to [Shao Zhilang], walking towards him. The two locked eyes, and [A Lan] reached into [Shao Zhilang]'s pocket. [Shao Zhilang] took his hands out of his pockets and opened them up. [A Lan] took out his phone, unlocked it, and opened WeChat.
0:42:47|0:43:9|[Shao Zhilang] watched [A Lan] closely as she glanced at him, then continued to click on a message from a girl. Inside were flirtatious messages between [Shao Zhilang] and the girl. After reading the messages, he glanced at [Shao Zhilang], then picked up his phone and observed it closely. He took out a pen from the phone, disassembled it, and found a chip inside the pen cap.
0:43:9|0:43:21|[A Lan] frowned and stared at [Shao Zhilang]. [Shao Zhilang] shook his head innocently. [A Lan] handed the phone to the bodyguard, who placed a handgun in his hand. [A Lan] turned to Ding Jie and asked:
0:43:30|0:43:45|He shot the thigh of the bodyguard next to him, and another bodyguard immediately searched the pockets of the one who got shot, finding a tracker. [A Lan] threw the chip in his hand to the ground, crushing it with his foot, and the image on the tracker indeed stopped.
0:43:47|0:43:53|[Shao Zhilang] and [Guo Ming] both stared at the bodyguard who was shot, while [A Lan] raised his gun.
0:44:2|0:44:12|Guo Ming finished speaking, and both A Lan and Shao Zhilang turned to look at him.
0:44:17|0:44:25|Guo Ming's two bodyguards shot and killed him at the same time. A Lan closed his eyes and touched his forehead. Guo Ming slowly got up.
0:44:57|0:45:5|The bodyguards all put down their guns, and walking towards them are Qin Huanxi and his men. Ding Xiaojia looks up at Qin Huanxi.
0:45:13|0:46:8|[Qin Huanxi] walked up to Ding Jie with a smile, squatted down in front of her and said, "Undercover in the Criminal Intelligence Division, [Ding Xiaojia]." Tears rolled down Ding Jie's eyes. [Qin Huanxi] slowly helped her up, brushed her hair on the forehead, "Long time no see." With a shot, he hit Ding Jie's forehead. Ding Jie leaned back towards the pool behind her, fell into the bottomless pool, where blood and water merged. She slowly sank to the bottom of the pool.
0:46:28|0:46:42|[Qin Huanxi] walked past [Shao Zhilang], his gaze following him step by step. [Guo Ming] and his men closely followed [Qin Huanxi]'s pace. [Shao Zhilang] and [A Lan] returned home and cooked instant noodles to eat.
0:47:45|0:48:9|[Shao Zhilang] got into a taxi and took out two identical phones from his pocket. He looked at the small icon in the upper right corner of the phone, recalling the scene when his brother [A Lan] checked his phone. He pondered in the car, then opened the message from [Ding Xiaojia], looking at the last message she sent him about meeting at 2:30. He put down the phone with a grim expression on his face.
0:48:9|0:48:23|Not long after, he arrived at an underground passage and saw [Q Sir] waiting for him from a distance. The two of them walked towards each other with serious expressions on their faces.
0:49:40|0:50:13|[Q Sir] grabbed [Shao Zhilang]'s collar, tears in his eyes, mouth twitching. He let go of the hand holding the collar and turned his back to him, calming himself down before asking:
0:50:23|0:50:30|On the other side, [A Lan] drank a glass of wine at home and placed the glass on the table. He recalled the surveillance video shown to him by [Guo Ming].
0:50:51|0:51:17|[Guo Ming] left after speaking. [A Lan] frowned and looked back at the surveillance video of the casino. He noticed that [Shao Zhilang] was rhythmically tapping the table with chips. Alone at home, he pondered over everything, his fingers gradually trembling. He knocked over a craft bottle on the table. [Shao Zhilang] was escorted by two security guards towards a private plane.
0:51:17|0:51:47|Before boarding, one of the bodyguards searched him and took out a cellphone from his pocket. After that, he was allowed to board the plane. The bodyguard put the cellphone into his own pocket. [Shao Zhilang] slowly boarded the plane and sat across from [A Lan]. [A Lan] wore a straw hat and flipped through a magazine. She glanced at [Shao Zhilang] across from her, then continued reading the magazine. [Shao Zhilang] shifted his gaze to the window. The plane quickly landed in the warm Brazil.
0:51:48|0:52:0|This is the largest country in South America, [Shao Zhilang] is sitting in the car, enjoying the tropical scenery of Brazil, while [Q Sir] and others are investigating him.
0:52:14|0:52:32|The car carrying [A Lan] and [Shao Zhilang] stopped by the seaside, where people were enjoying the heat wave. While [A Lan] was chatting with a foreigner under the car, [Shao Zhilang] waited inside the car. He glanced back at [A Lan], opened the car door to get out, but was stopped by a foreign bodyguard outside the car.
0:52:37|0:52:47|Relax, just buying some drinks, okay? Thank you, [Shao Zhilang] patted the back of the bodyguard, walked past a foreign beauty in shorts, and stole the phone from the beauty's pocket. At this moment, [Q Sir] received the text message he sent.
0:52:56|0:53:11|Keep your phone on, I'll find your location. [Shao Zhilang] returned to the back seat of the car, carefully checked the reply in his pocket. Soon, [A Lan] returned to the car, took the car keys from the bodyguard, sat in the driver's seat, and gestured to [Shao Zhilang]. [Shao Zhilang] opened the car door and moved from the back seat to the front seat.
0:53:13|0:53:36|The two of them moved forward along the coastline, the sunlight turning the beach into a golden color. They crossed through the dense buildings and streets of the city, driving a Ford car. They arrived at a small shop crowded with Brazilians, where a local man held a gun and signaled for them to stop. [Shao Zhilang] got out of the car, hiding the stolen phone in the gap between the seat and the backrest.
0:53:38|0:53:45|After getting off the car, two local men approached them and searched them thoroughly.
0:53:48|0:53:54|[Shao Zhilang] glanced at [A Lan], then got into a local car and drove away.
0:53:56|0:54:11|Here, some people are holding AK47s, some are holding pistols. After they leave, a man takes a bomb wrapped in newspaper from a basket of soda and places it under the chassis of the Ford car driven by [A Lan] and another man, while on the other side, [Q Sir] is actively searching for [Shao Zhilang].
0:54:30|0:54:57|[A Lan] The car carrying the two of them drove through the residential area and into a courtyard that seemed ordinary in this city. In the courtyard, there were many boxes, a leather sofa, and several chairs. After [A Lan] and the other person got out of the car, the locals in the courtyard welcomed them with smiles, saying "They're here, they're here." The people here were carrying things like cans of milk powder in their hands, with [A Lan] leading the way.
0:54:57|0:55:1|[Shao Zhilang] followed behind, looking around, idiot, get something for them to drink.
0:55:2|0:55:35|A foreigner in a suit is commanding his subordinates, toasting. Three of them raise their glasses and clink them together. He looks like a piece of sushi, while another looks like a slice of sashimi. [Shao Zhilang] sizes up these people. On a distant rooftop, a sniper rifle is aimed directly at [A Lan]'s hat. "Darling, I love you," [A Lan] strokes his coat.
0:55:37|0:55:51|Leaning back, [Q Sir] received a message in the intelligence department monitoring room. He quickly opened his phone, which read "Brazil live broadcast." He opened the live audio, asking, "Drive the truck over, where's my goods?"
0:55:53|0:56:14|On the other side, [A Lan] stood behind a large truck, a Brazilian guy opened the truck's door, inside were boxes of goods. [A Lan] gestured for him to step aside, then pointed to one of the boxes. The Brazilian behind him took out a small knife and cut open the box he pointed at. Inside the box were bags of white powder. [A Lan] took out a small bottle containing a clear liquid.
0:56:16|0:56:22|A spoonful of white powder was put in, shaken a few times, and the liquid in the test tube immediately turned blue.
0:56:22|0:56:50|He reached out his hand, and the Brazilian henchman handed him a cellphone. He made a call, and [Shao Zhilang] turned to look at him. He noticed that [A Lan] was tapping his watch rhythmically. On the other side, the Brazilian boss picked up a tablet next to him, and the screen showed the transaction was completed. The Brazilian boss smirked when he saw it, while a sniper named [Wu Bai] was aiming at [A Lan]'s head.
0:56:50|0:57:8|[Q Sir] suddenly heard gunshots during the live broadcast. The Brazilian henchman behind [A Lan] was instantly shot dead, and the Brazilian boss was about to shoot but was shot down. [A Lan] and [Shao Zhilang] picked up the handguns on the ground, each shooting a Brazilian drug dealer. The Brazilians on the next floor were about to shoot at the two of them, but were shot dead by [Wu Bai] from a distance.
0:57:8|0:57:29|[A Lan] and [Shao Zhilang] got into the car in the courtyard, stepped on the gas pedal, and the car crashed into the wall behind. [Wu Bai], who was far away on the road, shot and killed a Brazilian drug dealer holding a submachine gun. His consecutive sniping exposed his position, and the drug dealer on the opposite rooftop took out an AK47 and sprayed bullets at him. He quickly got up and evacuated from the rooftop. There was a machine gun mounted on the roof of the drug dealer's car.
0:57:29|0:57:32|A Lan's car was hit so hard that sparks were flying, and the windows were all shattered.
0:57:33|0:57:52|[Shao Zhilang] saw the situation turning bad, he pulled out a handgun and fired back at the vehicles chasing them. [Wu Bai] carried a sniper rifle on his back, jumped from the fourth floor window, landed on the ceiling of the second floor, smoothly flipped and landed. On the other side, [A Lan] was driving, being relentlessly pursued by Brazilian drug traffickers. As they turned a corner in a narrow alley, the traffickers' firepower intensified.
0:58:23|0:58:40|Blocking [A Lan]'s line of sight, luckily [A Lan] turned the corner in time. The bullets from the following car turned the wall into a sieve, and [A Lan] crashed into a fruit stand on the roadside. Their car was riddled with bullet holes, a bullet pierced their tire, causing [A Lan] to lose control and crash into a parked car on the side of the road.
0:58:40|0:59:2|Seeing the drug dealers catching up with them, [Shao Zhilang] pulled out his gun and took down the driver of the drug dealer, blood spraying onto the windshield. The drug dealer's car lost control and crashed into a parked car, coming to a stop. [A Lan] and [Shao Zhilang] got out of the car and used it as cover, while the drug dealer on the roof was reloading his submachine gun. The two of them ran forward to escape.
0:59:2|0:59:30|[Shao Zhilang] suddenly saw a man in front pulling the trigger of a pistol. He turned around and pushed [A Lan] away. The bullet mercilessly pierced through his abdomen. Seeing this, [A Lan] held onto [Shao Zhilang]'s arm with one hand and shot the soda on the roadside with the other hand. He braved the gunfire to drag [Shao Zhilang] behind a parked car on the side of the road. The Brazilian armed forces also rushed towards them. [A Lan] ran out of bullets in his handgun, panting heavily as he placed the gun aside. The drug traffickers gradually surrounded the two of them.
0:59:30|0:59:51|The two of them crouched on the ground, unable to defend themselves. The drug dealer drove closer and closer to them, about to reach the T-junction. Just then, [Wu Bai] rode a motorcycle out of the alley, leaned over to throw the motorcycle in front of the drug dealer's car, then stood up, crouched down, took out a gun from behind, aimed at the motorcycle's gas tank, and the explosion of the motorcycle had a powerful impact.
0:59:51|0:59:59|Wu Bai led the armed militants to the scene just in time to blow up the drug dealer's car. They used the car as cover and engaged in fierce combat with the Brazilian armed forces.
0:59:59|1:0:8|[A Lan] and [Shao Zhilang], after seeing the retreat signal, supported each other and ran to the Ford they came in. After getting into the car together, the door was immediately locked.
1:0:8|1:0:19|[Shao Zhilang] sat in the passenger seat, feeling a bit uneasy. Suddenly, the screen in the car lit up, and both of them stared at the incoming call. [A Lan] reached out to answer the phone.
1:0:28|1:0:37|The bomb under the car is counting down,
1:2:35|1:2:49|[Guo Ming]'s car exploded at the moment he screamed, [Shao Zhilang] looked out the window and smiled.
1:3:7|1:3:41|Shao Zhilang finished speaking, A Lan glanced at him, started the car, Q Sir crossed out the name Guo Ming just written on the paper, drew an arrow between Lan Bowen and Mr. Dong, A Lan drove the two to a sports stadium and stopped. The stadium was empty, A Lan pulled up the handbrake, took out a gun and pointed it at Shao Zhilang's head. Shao Zhilang looked at A Lan with a hint of resentment, opened the car door, and the two got out of the car together.
1:3:41|1:3:50|[A Lan] closed the car door, walked up to [Shao Zhilang], pointed a gun at him. [Shao Zhilang] covered his wound, the two locked eyes.
1:3:56|1:4:4|[Q Sir] listened to the conversation in the monitoring room as [A Lan] took out the phone hidden in the seat crevice by [Shao Zhilang] and opened a text message.
1:4:8|1:4:14|[A Lan] put down the phone he was holding and looked down at the ground helplessly.
1:4:19|1:4:34|A Lan's gaze shifted to the abdomen of Shao Zhilang, and she pressed the muzzle against Shao Zhilang's forehead.
1:4:43|1:4:56|Shao Zhilang furrowed his brows, watching A Lan tightly close her eyes. After a moment of contemplation, he took a deep breath, opened his eyes, and said to A Lan:
1:5:14|1:5:21|[A Lan]'s hand holding the gun began to tremble.
1:5:44|1:6:6|In the control room, [Q Sir] heard the gunshot and immediately put down the pen in his hand. The other police officers also stopped their work, looking very tense. On the other side, Shao Zhilang was lying on the ground holding his head, while [A Lan] emptied all the bullets from the gun onto the ground. [A Lan] put away the gun, closed the passenger door, and then returned to the car and drove away.
1:6:6|1:6:23|Shao Zhilang sat up and watched the departing car, [Q Sir] slowly turned around, leaning on the table with both hands, bending down in contemplation. The lights in the control room gradually dimmed, and he suddenly raised his head, as if recalling something.
1:6:25|1:6:34|The scene rewinds to the situation in the sports stadium. Before A Lan shoots Shao Zhilang, Shao Zhilang has not yet fallen down holding his head.
1:8:0|1:8:4|The lights in the control room are on, and everyone looks at [Q Sir], who is lost in thought.
1:8:5|1:8:31|[A Lan] drove up to a circular terrace and parked the car. He lit a cigarette inside the car, reminiscing about everything that had happened. When he pressed the button while adjusting his suit in Brazil, he was actually live streaming to [Q Sir], "Where's my merchandise?" He sat in the car, reflecting.
1:8:31|1:8:49|While smoking, [A Lan] pulled the buttons off his clothes, opened the car door, threw the buttons on the ground, extended a foot, forcefully crushed the button with a chip, then closed the car door and drove away. Night fell.
1:8:49|1:9:13|The setting sun cast a soft light on the coastline, and the streets of Hong Kong were bustling with people and vehicles at night. [Q Sir] took [Qin Huanxi] to a office building, where after facial and iris recognition, the door opened and they entered one after another.
1:9:13|1:9:41|[Q Sir] signaled for [Qin Huanxi] to knock on the door. [Qin Huanxi] walked into the officer's room and knocked on the door. When the door opened, [Ding Xiaojia] walked out with tears in her eyes. Unable to hold back her tears any longer, [Ding Xiaojia] tightly embraced [Qin Huanxi].
1:11:25|1:11:35|[Ding Xiaojia] smiled happily while eating noodles, while [Shao Zhilang] lay alone in the hospital ward.
1:11:42|1:11:55|[A Lan] is smoking on the recliner at home, with a van parked downstairs to monitor him.
1:12:22|1:12:34|[Ding Xiaojia] watched the monitor in her hand, while [A Lan] played with a Rubik's Cube at the window of the room. In the van, the police held a telephoto lens to monitor every move of [A Lan].
1:12:45|1:12:56|[A Lan] was playing with a Rubik's Cube in his hand, and the colors matched exactly with the Rubik's Cube that Officer Kang was solving. When [Q Sir] saw this, he widened his eyes and shook his head gently.
1:13:8|1:13:15|On the screen it reads: "File damaged, unable to repair, the letters corresponding to the Kang cipher table, on the other side,"
1:14:27|1:14:36|[Q Sir] opened his slightly sleepy eyes and saw [A Lan] tapping out a password on a cup in the surveillance footage.
1:14:46|1:14:55|Qin Huanxi sent a text message to Q Sir, who tilted his head, rolled his eyes, and held his own phone, deep in thought.
1:14:55|1:15:5|The next day, Qin Huanxi, A Lan, and Guo Ming gathered together. After Guo Ming took drugs on the table, he leaned back on the sofa, eyes and mouth wide open.
1:15:10|1:15:18|[A Lan] and [Qin Huanxi] took a sip of red wine at the same time and locked eyes.
1:16:10|1:16:25|Mr. Dong's henchman, [Wu Bai], brought in a man with his hands and mouth bound. [Wu Bai] pulled out a dagger, while Mr. Dong took out a cellphone from his pocket and started recording.
1:16:33|1:16:39|[Wu Bai] slashed the neck of [Guo Ming]'s henchman.
1:16:56|1:17:12|[Qin Huanxi] picked up the tablecloth stained with blood and wiped his hands. Seeing this, [A Lan] picked up his own clean tablecloth and handed it to [Qin Huanxi].
1:17:48|1:17:56|[Qin Huanxi] remains calm, with no change in expression, and smiles calmly.
1:18:47|1:19:9|[Qin Huanxi] still smiled, Mr. Dong suddenly patted [Qin Huanxi]'s hand on the table, turned it over to feel his pulse, stared into his eyes. [Qin Huanxi] recalled the scene after his wife was killed, looked up, but saw Mr. Dong gradually getting up, getting closer and closer to himself, and leaning on the table saying:
1:19:13|1:19:28|[Qin Huanxi] remembered that night when he held his dead wife and wept bitterly.
1:19:56|1:20:4|Three people drank red wine. [Qin Huanxi] and [A Lan] exchanged glances again, and finally [Qin Huanxi] got into [A Lan]'s car.
1:20:16|1:20:35|[A Lan] looked at [Qin Huanxi], who had a serious expression on her face. On the other side, [Shao Zhilang] received a package, and inside was a Superman toy. He carefully examined the toy on the sofa, then picked up the phone and answered it.
1:21:5|1:21:14|[Shao Zhilang] hung up the phone, took a moment to collect his thoughts, glanced at the Superman toy, and then threw it into the trash can.
1:21:32|1:21:51|The bustling street was filled with cars, moving in an orderly manner like ants. Rows of bright car lights flowed like a shining river without end. [A Lan] stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, picked up her phone and saw a message: "The young master is likely to make a move, arrest operation has been deployed."
1:21:51|1:22:9|He leaned heavily against the window frame, deep in thought. He called [Shao Zhilang] into his office, and [Shao Zhilang] sat in front of him. He put his legs off the table and moved the envelope on the table in front of [Shao Zhilang].
1:22:48|1:22:54|[Shao Zhilang] suddenly turned serious, crossed his arms on the table, and said:
1:23:26|1:23:32|[A Lan] picked up the cigarette on the table and lit it, then [Shao Zhilang] left after speaking.
1:23:34|1:23:55|[A Lan] took a deep drag of his cigarette, lost in thought. He and Xiao Ying arrived at the parking lot together. Once inside, Xiao Ying looked around anxiously, tugging at [A Lan]'s arm to indicate where the car was parked. The two walked side by side between rows of cars, their pace slow. [A Lan] kept his head down, seeming somewhat distracted.
1:23:57|1:24:26|Xiaoying seemed to sense some movement behind her. She let go of [A Lan]'s arm and lifted the backpack. [A Lan] also noticed the person hiding behind the pillar. Xiaoying reached for the gun at her waist with one hand and pressed on [A Lan]'s shoulder with the other. As the gun went off, Xiaoying pushed [A Lan] down, lowered her head and ran forward, while seven or eight people hiding behind the pillar started shooting at them simultaneously.
1:24:40|1:24:57|The crowd stood up and looked towards the door. The apartment door where Ding Xiaojia was located was blown up, and several men in black broke in. Ding Xiaojia was being protected by her colleagues as she ran towards another door to escape. She accidentally fell to the ground, and a colleague disregarded his own safety.
1:24:59|1:25:13|Firing the gun to drive back the men in black, then helping her up. On the other side, A Lan smashes a car window, releases the handbrake, squats down and pushes the car with force, moving it to the aisle as a cover, looking for a safer position.
1:25:14|1:25:19|Xiao Ying frequently fired under his cover, but was still no match for the gunfire from all directions.
1:25:19|1:25:43|Just as A Lan dodged the attack from the front, several people came from behind. Xiao Ying turned around and A Lan pushed her against a wall, fiercely fighting back against the enemies. Bullets flew around like raindrops, shattering the car windows nearby. Just as he peeked out, he was bombarded by a dense barrage of bullets, causing him to scramble in panic. He rolled to the corner of the wall in a sorry state, panting, and then noticed,
1:25:43|1:25:59|Next to the car, there was a large patch of blood. He froze, slowly shifting his gaze to Xiaoying, seeing her blood dripping slowly to the ground from her body. She gritted her teeth, kneeling on the ground with a gun in hand, protecting herself without any hesitation. At this moment,
1:25:59|1:26:12|The bodyguard who came to support drove a car and stopped behind the two of them. [A Lan] stood up and tried to help Xiao Ying up, while the bodyguard got out of the car and pulled out a gun to buy time for [A Lan] to leave.
1:26:15|1:26:38|The bodyguard forcibly took away [A Lan]. As [A Lan] was being dragged away, he watched helplessly as Xiao Ying was shot. With a blank expression, he allowed himself to be dragged away, while Xiao Ying, with disheveled hair, mustered all her remaining strength to kneel down and shoot at the men in black. After firing a few shots, she was shot again. [A Lan] stared at Xiao Ying intently, but she was getting farther and farther away from him.
1:26:39|1:27:5|Xiao Ying's head and the hand holding the gun drooped down. [A Lan] was finally dragged into the back seat of the car by the bodyguards. Just as [A Lan] got into the car, several bodyguards closed the door and surrounded him in the middle. [A Lan] frowned on the swaying car with tears in his eyes. On the other side, [Ding Xiaojia] opened the door of the safety passage and tried to escape. She limped away while looking back.
1:27:5|1:27:25|Seeing the elevator, she rushed over to press the buttons of the two elevators, anxiously waiting for them. When the doors opened, two men wearing black masks appeared inside. One of them raised a handgun, causing [Ding Xiaojia] to panic and take two steps back. The man in the elevator suddenly got shot, dodging to the side. [Q Sir] then appeared behind her, firing several shots into the elevator.
1:27:25|1:27:43|[Ding Xiaojia] was so scared that she hid on the side, trembling all over. Another masked man in the elevator was hiding inside. [Q Sir] saw the position of the masked man through the glass reflection. He slowly approached the elevator and fired the last bullet in his gun. Seizing the opportunity, the masked man tried to escape, but [Q Sir] directly smashed the gun at him.
1:27:43|1:28:0|Disarm the masked man's gun, then twist the masked man's arm around his chest and throw him down in the elevator. [Ding Xiaojia] tries to take the opportunity to get up and escape, but is scared by the gunshots in the elevator and falls directly to the ground. [Ding Xiaojia] lifts her head and watches the two struggling together, grabbing each other's clothes and pushing each other.
1:28:0|1:28:24|Unexpectedly pressed the elevator floor button, when the masked man aimed the gun at [Q Sir]'s head, the elevator door slowly closed. Startled by the gunshot, [Ding Xiaojia] quickly got up from the ground, rushed to the elevator and pressed the button, frantically pounding on the elevator door. In panic, she turned and ran towards the stairs, crying as she ran downstairs, unable to hide her sorrow. She almost slipped and fell due to the sadness.
1:28:24|1:28:40|She continued to run down the stairs, holding onto the railing, as the elevator rapidly descended. Gunshots could be heard from time to time, and finally, it stopped at the b floor. When the elevator doors opened, a body fell out directly.
1:28:40|1:28:47|[Q Sir], who was seriously injured, leaned against the wall motionless. He dropped his gun on the ground, and [Ding Xiaojia] anxiously ran to the elevator on the B floor.
1:28:55|1:29:33|In a corner, a man in black suddenly started shooting at the two people. Before [Q Sir] could finish speaking, [Ding Xiaojia] immediately picked up the gun and magazine on the ground. She held a bullet in her mouth and assembled the gun with all her strength. Looking up at the man in black, tears streamed down her face. The man in black dropped the jammed gun and pulled out a dagger from his pocket. Limping due to his injury, he approached the two. However, [Ding Xiaojia] couldn't load the gun because of her injured wrist, still wearing a wrist guard. Seeing the man in black getting closer, she hurriedly removed the wrist guard.
1:29:33|1:29:38|With his injured wrist, [A Lan] struggled to load the pistol.
1:30:42|1:30:58|[Ding Xiaojia] knelt on the ground, one hand holding [Q Sir], while the other hand rested on the ground. [Q Sir] buried his face in her shoulder. In the narrow elevator, the walls were covered with bloodstains, and guns and bullets were scattered around.
1:30:58|1:31:7|[Ding Xiaojia] tightly embraced [Q Sir] with her slender body, sobbing in pain. The scene then shifted to the intelligence department.
1:31:16|1:31:37|[A Lan] in a windbreaker, quickly arrived at their old place, Mei Ji Restaurant, where [Shao Zhilang] was sitting alone at a table eating noodles, with a bottle of beer on the table. [A Lan] walked into the restaurant and went straight to him, picked up the beer on the table and drank it all, then sat down next to [Shao Zhilang].
1:32:13|1:32:28|Shao Zhilang was about to reach the door, but he slowly stopped in his tracks, stood still for a moment, then quickly turned back. A Lan pulled out a handgun and pointed it at Shao Zhilang. Shao Zhilang looked at the gun on the table, then glanced at A Lan.
1:33:18|1:33:43|With a sinister smile on his face, [A Lan] takes out the detonator for the bomb. [Shao Zhilang] glances at the screen of his phone, the time left until the explosion getting shorter. The two face off, as if time has frozen. [Shao Zhilang] becomes increasingly tense, frowning as he looks at [A Lan]. [A Lan] raises an eyebrow at him, signaling him to make a choice quickly. The countdown of the bomb is down to six seconds.
1:33:49|1:34:12|After saying that, [Shao Zhilang] aimed at his own chin and pulled the trigger. His body fell backwards, the impact of the gun throwing him harshly to the ground. His chin was also burnt black, and as he and the gun landed together, a bullet casing also dropped onto the tiled floor. He stared at the spinning casing on the ground without moving. Seeing this scene, [A Lan] closed her eyes and covered her forehead with her hand.
1:34:12|1:34:36|Rubbing his face back and forth, he propped up his chin with his hand, looking very helpless. The shotgun shells on the floor gradually stopped spinning, and the timer next to Wenwen also ended. A pleasant music came from the bomb, but Wenwen, who was sleeping soundly, was not awakened. [Shao Zhilang] lying on the ground heard the crisp ringtone from his phone and gradually regained his senses.
1:34:36|1:34:51|He touched his chin with one hand, propped up his body with the other arm, sat up, and looked at [A Lan] in front of him. The scene shifted to [A Lan] and [Shao Zhilang] sitting together at the dining table.
1:35:36|1:35:58|As they raised their beers and took a sip, the door of the restaurant suddenly swung open from the outside. A figure in a leather jacket quietly walked in.
1:35:59|1:36:13|[A Lan] and [Shao Zhilang] heard the movement at the door, frowned, and looked towards the direction of the door. They walked into the restaurant and the sound of a sharp knife sliding on the table and chairs could be heard.
1:36:22|1:36:30|The shadow is none other than [Guo Ming]'s henchman [Wu Bai].
1:36:43|1:37:9|As they spoke, they stood up. [A Lan] picked up the bottle on the table and smashed it on the edge of the table. [Shao Zhilang] wrapped a corner of the tablecloth around his hand. [Wu Bai] charged towards them with a fierce look on his face, plunging the dagger in his hand into [A Lan]'s body. [A Lan] then grabbed the broken bottle and stabbed it directly into the back of [Wu Bai]'s neck. Taking advantage of the situation, [Shao Zhilang] grabbed a chair and struck [Wu Bai] with it. [Wu Bai] quickly pulled out the dagger, while [A Lan] jumped up and tore down the purple-gold clock from the ceiling.
1:37:9|1:37:22|A object hit [Wu Bai] on the head, causing darkness in the restaurant. [Shao Zhilang] and [A Lan] walked towards the exit, with [Shao Zhilang] immediately turning back to push the restaurant door towards [Wu Bai]. [Shao Zhilang] held his wound with one hand and tried to support [A Lan] with the other.
1:37:24|1:37:52|[A Lan] barely stood up by holding onto his waist. After taking a few steps, [A Lan] fell on the steps, but they didn't give up. [A Lan] gritted his teeth and tightly grabbed [Shao Zhilang], and the two supported each other as they walked out. At this moment, [Wu Bai] rushed towards them with a dagger in hand. [Shao Zhilang] pushed [A Lan] away and used his hand to block the dagger coming towards him. [A Lan] picked up a fire extinguisher next to him and smashed it towards [Wu Bai].
1:37:53|1:38:19|[Wu Bai] lifted [A Lan]'s legs and tackled him down, [A Lan] used his elbows to hit [Wu Bai]'s back. They both fell onto the glass door. [Wu Bai] stepped on glass shards and walked out from the door frame, one hand covering his neck as he glared fiercely at [Shao Zhilang], slowly approaching him. [Shao Zhilang] knelt on the ground, his hands covered in blood. He picked up a dagger from the ground with one hand and stabbed towards [Wu Bai]'s head, but [Wu Bai] easily dodged it.
1:38:19|1:38:45|Just as he was about to stab [Wu Bai] in the abdomen, he was grabbed by [Wu Bai] at the wound on his abdomen. [Wu Bai] took the opportunity to push him onto the shelves in the corridor, then turned the knife towards [Shao Zhilang]. Gritting his teeth, [Wu Bai] inserted the dagger into [Shao Zhilang]'s chest. [Shao Zhilang]'s veins bulged, his mouth opened wide, his lips trembling slightly, and his body slowly slid down.
1:38:45|1:38:58|At this moment, a pair of blood-stained hands slowly reached out from the glass shards, [A Lan] covered in blood crawled out from the door frame. He lifted his head, looked around, and finally locked his gaze on [Shao Zhilang].
1:38:58|1:39:21|The two locked eyes, [Shao Zhilang] forced a smile on his face, and [A Lan] looked at his good brother, also slightly smiling. Then, he tried to prop up his body with his hands. [Shao Zhilang] shook his head while smiling, and [Wu Bai] pulled out the dagger stabbed into his chest, blood oozing out, the blade covered in [Shao Zhilang]'s blood.
1:39:21|1:39:41|He gritted his teeth in pain, [A Lan] crawled slowly towards [Shao Zhilang], unable to control his balance, even knocking over the baskets in the aisle. He leaped forward, knocking [Wu Bai] to the ground with his body, causing [Shao Zhilang] to stumble as well.
1:39:41|1:40:7|[A Lan] grabbed [Wu Bai] and hoisted him onto his shoulders, allowing him to pound his back before slamming him down onto the road. At that moment, a blinding beam of light came from the darkness, and a bus rolled over the two. The driver stopped the bus, passengers scattered, and he glanced out the window before quickly unfastening his seatbelt and opening the door.
1:40:7|1:40:13|He slowly got out of the car, taking heavy steps and leaning against the car as he walked towards the back.
1:40:13|1:40:35|When he saw two men with bloodstains lying behind the car, he took out his phone from his pocket and dialed a number. At this moment, [Shao Zhilang] slowly walked out of the building and approached the body of [A Lan]. He knelt beside [A Lan], sobbing, with a tear falling down his face.
1:40:35|1:41:5|Following that, tears the size of beans fell like raindrops. He looked at his brother, unable to contain his grief, slowly leaning forward. He reached out a hand and gently held [A Lan]'s hand, then lifted [A Lan]'s index finger. [A Lan] seemed to feel the touch of his brother, his lips trembling slightly as if he wanted to say something, but soon became motionless.
1:41:6|1:41:15|[Shao Zhilang] couldn't hide his sadness, he held [A Lan]'s hand and heavily knocked his head on the cement floor three times.
1:41:23|1:41:39|On the other side, Mr. Dong played with his cigar box, took out a gun from the bottom of the box, closed the box, loaded the magazine, and inserted it into his waist. He straightened his suit and walked towards the living room.
1:41:39|1:41:48|[Shao Zhilang] had been waiting for her on the sofa outside, his expression very serious as he walked slowly towards [Qin Huanxi].
