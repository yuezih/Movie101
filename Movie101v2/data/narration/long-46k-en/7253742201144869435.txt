0:0:53|0:1:9|The film begins with [Brother Cheng]'s son-in-law [Sir Wan] smoking on the overpass waiting for someone. Shortly after, a man, along with his wife and daughter, arrives at the overpass as arranged with [Sir Wan]. After getting out of the car, the man lovingly picks up his daughter and speaks to her tenderly.
0:1:32|0:1:38|As soon as Sir Wan turned around, he saw the assassin with a gun standing not far away. With a quick move, the assassin pulled the trigger.
0:1:41|0:1:55|The shot was precise, hitting the daughter directly. The man had no time to check on her and could only seize the opportunity to escape. After he climbed over the bushes, he found himself on an empty road. In this environment, he didn't run far before being shot by the assassin and fell into a pool of blood.
0:1:55|0:2:7|Hearing the commotion, [Sir Wan] jumped down from the overpass without hesitation, pulled out his gun and started firing back at the assassin. Seeing this, the assassin began to flee down a narrow path. [Sir Wan] followed closely behind, shouting at the assassin:
0:2:9|0:2:14|Just when no one shouted, a shout provoked the killer's counterattack. [Sir Wan] saw the situation and already knew in his heart.
0:2:17|0:2:23|So he kept looking for the right moment to shoot, and the gunshots alerted two patrolling police officers.
0:2:35|0:2:49|While the two police officers were talking, the killer had already crossed the highway and ran to an abandoned overpass. Despite the many fast-moving cars on the highway, this did not stop the experienced Sir Wan, who quickly caught up with the killer.
0:2:49|0:2:56|On the overpass, as Sir Wan and the assassin were getting further apart, just as the assassin was about to succeed, police officers arrived at the other end of the overpass.
0:2:59|0:3:14|The assassin, seeing no way out, fired a shot at the police officer and jumped off the bridge. [Sir Wan] quickly fired back, but unfortunately ran out of bullets at a critical moment. As the assassin jumped off the overpass, he landed directly into a garbage truck. At that moment, the police officer decisively fired a shot, killing the assassin.
0:3:44|0:3:49|Zu'er's friend climbed up eagerly to look through the peephole, only to be disappointed and said immediately.
0:4:22|0:4:27|[Zu'er] opened the gift with great anticipation, only to find a pair of headphones. He said disappointedly.
0:4:49|0:4:52|Zu'er is clumsy, said Sir Wan.
0:4:56|0:4:58|Zu'er exclaimed in surprise upon seeing the gift.
0:5:21|0:5:33|After listening, the father did not continue to joke with the two, but instead changed his smiling face, picked up the photo next to him, then took out his reading glasses, carefully examined it, and said to [Zu'er] with a worried expression.
0:5:52|0:5:55|[Zu'er] with moist eyes, hugged her father.
0:5:59|0:6:13|At the same time, Zu'er's brother [A Hua] was driving a convertible sports car through the bustling city, purposefully pulling up in front of a well-known jewelry store and then parking the car on the street before walking into the store without looking back.
0:6:13|0:6:19|The handsome [A Hua] didn't forget to exchange flirtatious glances with the passing beauties, attracting the attention of the nearby traffic police.
0:6:28|0:6:40|Shortly after, [A Hua] took the ticket and politely thanked the police. Then, he elegantly jumped into the convertible and drove home. At the same time, [Sir Wan] walked out holding a cake.
0:6:54|0:7:3|[Zu'er] made a wish and then blew out the candle with a whip. [Zu'er]'s friend immediately grabbed the cake and stuffed it into her mouth.
0:7:50|0:8:7|[Sir Wan] said, then got up to open the door for [A Hua]. The two greeted each other briefly. When [Da Sha] saw [A Hua], he also got up happily to greet him.
0:8:18|0:8:28|While speaking, she put the pearl necklace around [Da Sha]'s neck. After the birthday party ended, the father and [A Hua] talked in the basement.
0:8:53|0:9:6|From then on, [A Hua] started up his convertible sports car. The next day, the [colleagues] at the police station demonstrated how to interrogate.
0:9:16|0:9:18|This is a group of dancers caught by the policewoman.
0:9:42|0:9:55|Sir Wan, the cock-eyed policeman, was about to make a move when he was unexpectedly kicked to the ground by a woman. She even managed to shove a half-eaten popsicle into his mouth, and then swiftly knocked down all the approaching policemen.
0:10:11|0:10:23|The police chief called [Sir Wan] and the woman into the office. The woman looked smug, while [Sir Wan] was displeased with her behavior. The chief then introduced the two to each other. Reluctantly, [Sir Wan] shook hands with her.
0:10:54|0:11:3|Tan Ling placed the prepared file bag on the table. Wang Yongqiang took the file bag and glanced at the name of the investigation company, then said to the leader.
0:11:30|0:11:34|Shortly after, [Sir Wan] and [Zu'er] drove to the company entrance to collect evidence.
0:12:20|0:12:32|As soon as Wang Yongqiang finished speaking, a rather ostentatious luxury car slowly stopped at the entrance of the building. After the car came to a stop, the assistant in the front seat got out first, then opened the door for the boss [Da Sha] sitting in the back seat.
0:12:34|0:12:53|[Sir Wan] saw [Da Sha] and quickly hid behind Tan Lin's legs. At that moment, [Zu'er] saw this scene, got angry, threw something into the car, and walked away. When [Sir Wan] saw that it was [Zu'er], he hurriedly climbed out of the skylight to explain.
0:12:57|0:13:3|In response to Sir Wan's call, Zu'er didn't stop at all, but instead walked faster in a trend of anger.
0:13:39|0:13:53|After Sir Wan left the Red Robe group, Da Sha also entered the building with his henchmen. Shortly after, the drug smugglers arrived at Da Sha's office. Mr. Cao, the leader, dressed in a suit and sunglasses, politely greeted Da Sha with a slight bow and clasped hands.
0:13:53|0:14:5|[Da Sha] said nothing, gesturing for him to sit down. One of Cao's henchmen on the side took out a sample prepared in advance and threw it in front of [Da Sha]. [A Hua] on the side took the drugs, tasted a bit, and nodded towards [Da Sha].
0:14:8|0:14:14|Da Sha turned his head to look at A Hua, who walked up to Boss Cao with a smile on his face.
0:15:6|0:15:22|On the other side, [Zu'er], a gymnastics coach, dressed in a tight gymnastics suit, is watching the students training in the classroom attentively. Some are practicing on the rings, some on the parallel bars. However, [Zu'er] notices two students sitting in the corner, so he walks over and asks.
0:15:28|0:15:31|[Zu'er] turned to look at the young man outside the door.
0:15:50|0:15:58|Zu'er's father, Brother Cheng, happened to witness the scene where the boy fell down.
0:17:6|0:17:10|Father Wan let out a sigh, then frowned with worry as he pinched his brow.
0:17:41|0:17:52|At the same time, outside the building, after disguising herself, Tan Ling obtained some information about the company in the building, and rushed to report to [Sir Wan], who was also waiting for him with his favorite ice cream.
0:18:43|0:18:54|After discussing, Tan Ling disguised herself as Miss Wu, a wealthy woman, and successfully approached [A Hua]'s company with a large sum of money. When [A Hua] saw the amount Tan Ling wanted to handle, he was also shocked and said.
0:19:56|0:20:10|After Tan Ling narrowly avoided the person next to her, she continued to gather evidence in the company, while [A Hua] immediately went to find the clumsy intruder [Da Sha] to inquire about the situation. At this moment, there was only Tan Ling left in the office, constantly searching on the desk, but finding nothing of value.
0:20:10|0:20:16|She casually picked up a photo of [A Hua] and her sister, and at that moment, [A Hua] happened to come back.
0:20:39|0:20:48|Shortly after, Sir Wan and Zu'er arrived at a western restaurant downstairs of the company. They had a pleasant conversation while dining. When they were almost done with their meal, Tan Ling excused herself to go to the restroom and reported the situation.
0:20:51|0:21:0|And at that moment, it was [Zu'er] who happened to see [A Hua] coming to find her. Just as Tan Ling left, [Zu'er] sat down at the dining table and greeted her brother.
0:21:8|0:21:14|[A Hua] took the application form from the community center and looked at it carefully, while Zu'er asked eagerly on his left.
0:21:35|0:21:58|While clearing the dishes, the waiter accidentally knocked over A Hua's pen. Zu'er picked up the pen and suddenly remembered something to say. Upon hearing this, A Hua panicked and quickly signed the document before sending Zu'er away.
0:22:1|0:22:14|After [Zu'er] left, [A Hua]'s eyes suddenly turned fierce, then he took out his phone to arrange a plan with [Da Sha] and his men. Meanwhile, Tan Ling, who was reporting the situation to [Sir Wan] in the restroom, was still unaware that danger was quietly approaching.
0:22:14|0:22:18|Upon learning about Tan Ling's identity, [A Hua] did not expose her, but continued to proceed according to the normal process.
0:22:38|0:22:46|[A Hua] directly turned the tables and brought him directly to the drug trafficking den, and soon arrived at the shipping yard. The little brother in charge of the barge rushed forward.
0:22:47|0:23:3|After [A Hua] got off the car, his younger brother quickly parked the car. [A Hua] then went to Tan Long's side to show him the way, and the two of them walked towards the ferry, one in front and one behind. They climbed the ladder and arrived at the bridge of the ferry, where they could see the entire view of the shipping yard at a glance.
0:23:17|0:23:27|As soon as this was said, [Sir Wan] immediately became flustered, but after a moment, he cleverly responded.
0:23:27|0:23:43|Upon realizing his identity was exposed, [Tan Lin] instinctively retreated towards the cabin door, with [A Hua] also approaching with a serious expression. Looking outside, [Tan Lin] saw several thugs converging from all directions, but as an international police officer, [Tan Lin] naturally wouldn't just sit back and do nothing, facing the towering thugs.
0:23:43|0:23:58|With little effort, he easily dealt with them, but more thugs arrived, forcing [Tan Lin] to fight and retreat. Seeing that his men were no match for [Tan Lin], [A Hua] personally stepped in. Despite his polite appearance, [A Hua] was ruthless in action, and with just a few moves, he knocked the police officer [Tan Lin] to the ground.
0:23:58|0:24:10|At this moment, the thugs took advantage of the situation and rushed in. [Tan Lin] reacted quickly, performing a carp stance to get up from the ground, then knocking down the thugs with two punches before running towards the top of the boat. The thugs hurried to chase after him, and soon, five or six of them gathered on the narrow boat roof.
0:24:11|0:24:24|Bare-handed [Tan Ling] was unable to break through and was soon injured by the thugs. However, [Tan Ling] did not give up easily, vowing to fight the criminals to the end. At this moment, [Tan Ling] was already at the end of her strength, with both physical and endurance reaching their limits.
0:24:24|0:24:40|At this moment, [A Hua] slowly climbed up from the ladder, he saw [Tan Ling] fighting with the thugs but did not intervene. It wasn't until [Tan Lin] was knocked down that he walked over. He grabbed [Tan Lin], stared into her eyes, and mercilessly delivered a powerful punch, leaving the exhausted [Tan Lin] completely unable to resist.
0:24:40|0:24:57|Shortly after, he picked up the nearby rope, looped it around Tan Lin's neck, and then kicked Tan Lin off the deck. As Tan Lin was halfway falling, [A Hua] suddenly stepped on the rope. And so, a brave and skilled international female police officer sacrificed her precious life. That night, [Sir Wan] expressed his confusion.
0:25:34|0:25:40|[Sir Wan] nodded, walked towards the leader's office, and knocked on the door with determination.
0:26:19|0:26:28|[Sir Wan] walked out of the office with a disgruntled look after being scolded by the leader, while at the same time, [Zu'er] led the community members onto the boat for a visit.
0:26:57|0:27:2|The teacher led the group out of the lounge, but two students secretly hid themselves, wanting to continue the tour.
0:27:16|0:27:32|After taking photos, they continued to tour the boat. Meanwhile, disregarding their family relationship, [Sir Wan] angrily stormed into [A Hua]'s office. Seeing [Sir Wan] there, [A Hua] asked knowingly as [Sir Wan] took out a photo of Tan Lin and inquired.
0:28:34|0:28:40|[A Hua]'s seamless acting successfully deceived [Sir Wan]. As he came out of the building, his subordinates eagerly asked him.
0:28:46|0:29:0|Confirmed that they had dinner together. Tell me, [Sir Wan] and the others left the building and went elsewhere. In the afternoon, after the students visited the shipyard, they returned to the classroom and continued their training. At this moment, male student Huang Zhiqiang handed the washed photos to [Zu'er].
0:29:7|0:29:21|After the community event in the afternoon, [Zu'er] returned home with documents and photos. As soon as he pushed open the door, he was choked by the smoke in the room. Looking into the living room, he found [Sir Wan] sitting alone in the corner smoking, with documents scattered all over the floor.
0:29:21|0:29:26|Zu'er, upon seeing the situation, quickly put down what was in her hands and approached Sir Wan.
0:29:37|0:29:41|[Sir Wan] listlessly extinguished the cigarette and said to [Zu'er] in great frustration.
0:29:46|0:29:53|[Zu'er] picked up the information about Tan Ling on the ground, looked at the photo on it, and said to [Sir Wan].
0:30:2|0:30:12|[Zu'er] stood up helplessly after being poured cold water by [Sir Wan]. [Sir Wan] still looked dejected, staring at the documents in his hand, constantly pondering where Tan Ling might have gone.
0:30:12|0:30:23|After a while, Zu'er finished showering and found Sir Wan still in the living room, smoking with a listless look. Seeing this, Zu'er couldn't help but worry about Sir Wan's health, so she walked over and said.
0:30:23|0:30:28|Honey, you go take a shower first. [Sir Wan] impatiently writes the report without saying a word.
0:30:37|0:30:51|[Sir Wan] faced [Zu'er]'s concern and once again poured cold water on him. [Zu'er] angrily walked towards the bedroom. Watching [Zu'er]'s back, [Sir Wan] felt he was a bit too harsh, but he was tormented by the case and had no extra energy to comfort [Zu'er].
0:30:51|0:31:3|[Zu'er] returned to the room and angrily threw the towel on the bed, sitting alone on the edge of the bed in a sulk. He was extremely dissatisfied with [Sir Wan]'s attitude, and couldn't help but feel jealous when he thought about [Sir Wan]'s previous intimate contact with Tan Ling.
0:31:4|0:31:18|At that moment, [Zu'er] suddenly remembered the photos given by the students in the afternoon. With nothing else to do, [Zu'er] picked up the photos and started flipping through them one by one. As he flipped through, he saw in the group photo taken in front of the cold storage, Tan Ling's body was in the corner.
0:31:18|0:31:24|The next morning, [Zu'er] arrived at her father's house and found her brother [A Hua]. At that moment, their father and [A Hua] were having breakfast.
0:31:35|0:31:38|Drag A Hua out into the courtyard, said Sir Wan.
0:32:5|0:32:11|[A Hua] was suddenly at a loss for words, but the matter was of great importance, and [Zu'er] impatiently urged him on.
0:32:11|0:32:29|Later, [A Hua] and [Zu'er] arrived at the shipyard. [A Hua] opened the door of the ship and let [Zu'er] search freely. Despite searching from the kitchen to the dormitory, [Zu'er] found nothing. He then asked [A Hua] to take him to the cold storage in the cabin to search, unaware that the body had already been moved. [A Hua] calmly opened the door of the cold storage and said.
0:32:34|0:32:44|After searching around, [Zu'er] left the cabin with a mix of belief and doubt. He went to the office and called student Huang Zhiqiang, preparing to retrieve the negatives.
0:32:56|0:33:19|When A Hua, who was eavesdropping outside the door, saw Zu'er leave, he immediately picked up the phone and informed his subordinate Sir Wan of the address, preparing to snatch the film in advance. Huang Zhiqiang, who was eager for a vacation, wanted to set off early, so he discussed it with his girlfriend in the house. At this moment, the deliveryman who came to pick up the package rang the doorbell.
0:33:22|0:33:36|Saying that, Huang Zhiqiang put the film into an envelope and handed it to the courier. And his girlfriend, in order to inform [Zu'er] of their whereabouts, wrote a note with the location they were going to and stuck it on the door. [Zu'er] drove over in a hurry, but he was still one step too late.
0:33:36|0:33:44|As they crossed the road from the apartment gate, the taxi that [Zu'er] was riding in stopped downstairs. And just like that, they passed by each other inexplicably.
0:33:45|0:33:51|Sir Wan got out of the car and quickly walked into the apartment. At the same time, A Hua's men had already taken the elevator upstairs.
0:34:1|0:34:7|Soon after, the two of them walked towards the elevator, while another henchman took out his phone and called [A Hua] to report the current situation.
0:34:28|0:34:51|At this moment, Sir Wan and his friends also arrived at the vacation house. Meanwhile, Da Sha and A Hua, along with their henchmen, also arrived here. Sir Wan and his girlfriend pulled back the curtains and saw them.
0:35:6|0:35:18|Just as the group was at a loss, [A Hua] and [Da Sha] had already walked in with their men from the main entrance, and the boy thought they were the landlord and spoke up.
0:35:46|0:35:59|Da Sha directly threw Huang Diqiang to his subordinates, who lifted Huang Diqiang and rushed into the current tank. [A Hua] asked the girl next to him. The girl shook her head, but was then knocked out by [A Hua].
0:36:8|0:36:16|Da Sha slapped his face with a fierce look. With a powerful punch, Da Sha made the boy wince in pain, then turned to look at Sir Wan's girlfriend.
0:36:20|0:36:37|Da Sha, after hearing this, looked sharply at A Hua beside him. A Hua furrowed his brows, and after a discussion between the two, they prepared to ask Zu'er for the negatives. Little did they know, Zu'er's taxi had already arrived near the resort. Da Sha pulled out a gun, ready to deal with the five students inside the house, when suddenly,
0:36:49|0:37:3|Tie them all up. Meanwhile, Zu'er is still at the resort, searching for the whereabouts of the group. Inside the house, A Hua, thinking he might spare the students, is actually making a bomb using gas and circuits. After finishing the bomb, A Hua walks towards the outside of the house.
0:37:3|0:37:12|Before long, they encountered a group of children playing and frolicking. The children, upon seeing a group of adults in suits approaching them, immediately felt very scared.
0:37:17|0:37:19|A Hua bent down and said in a calm tone.
0:37:24|0:37:26|The little girl and Xiao Ming on the side said.
0:37:50|0:38:13|Indeed, the vacation house is filled with gas, and once the short-circuited doorbell is touched, it will ignite all the gas, causing an explosion. The five students inside the house are tied up and unable to move, with their mouths taped shut, leaving them with no way to seek help from the outside world.
0:38:14|0:38:30|Only able to squirm desperately, hoping for a miracle to happen. Before the children returned to the apartment, [Zu'er] had already stepped outside. He lingered outside for a long time, feeling that something was amiss. The vacation home, which should have been lively, was now very quiet, making [Zu'er] doubt if he had gone the wrong way.
0:38:32|0:38:49|After confirming the room number was correct, [Zu'er] still pressed the doorbell. With a loud bang, the room was instantly engulfed in flames, and [Zu'er] was thrown several meters away by the blast, fainting on the roadside. The commotion alarmed nearby residents, who then rushed [Zu'er] to the hospital for emergency treatment.
0:38:49|0:39:5|Upon receiving the news, [Sir Wan] immediately put down his work and rushed to the hospital to take care of [Zu'er]. Although [Zu'er]'s illness was not serious, she was still lying unconscious on the hospital bed. As [Sir Wan] looked at the unconscious [Zu'er], tears welled up in his eyes. At that moment, [Zu'er]'s father also hurriedly arrived at the ward.
0:39:5|0:39:15|The father wanted to ask about the situation, but afraid of disturbing his daughter's rest, he didn't ask much. Just then, [Zu'er] slowly opened her eyes and hugged [Sir Wan] with great distress.
0:39:19|0:39:27|[Sir Wan] gently comforted [Zu'er] as he slowly laid him on the bed. After [Zu'er] settled down, he asked with a hint of tears in his voice.
0:39:35|0:39:39|Sir Wan kissed Zu'er on the forehead and Zu'er continued to ask.
0:40:11|0:40:35|Sir Wan affectionately kissed Zu'er's hand before getting up to investigate the case. As he walked to the door, he couldn't help but remind Zu'er worriedly. Seeing Zu'er nod, Sir Wan led his team back to the resort. At that moment, Xiao Ming was playing with his friends.
0:40:35|0:40:42|Xiao Ming, realizing the situation, knew he couldn't play anymore, so he quickly ate the ice cream in his hand and climbed out of the dried-up swimming pool.
0:40:47|0:40:54|At this moment, [Sir Wan] happened to pass by, followed by the [colleague] wearing [Wang Yongqiang]'s clothes.
0:41:53|0:42:9|[Sir Wan] then left the resort and rushed back to the police station to have the evidence tested, before heading non-stop to the hospital where [Zu'er] was. [Zu'er] had her face scratched by the explosion debris, her once beautiful face now covered in thick bandages, which deeply saddened [Sir Wan].
0:42:9|0:42:14|[Sir Wan] saw that [Zu'er] was still sleeping, so he didn't wake him up, but sat quietly beside him to accompany him.
0:42:18|0:42:25|At this moment, Sir Wan's phone suddenly rang, the ringtone woke up Zu'er.
0:43:4|0:43:9|After hanging up the phone, Sir Wan solemnly said to Zu'er.
0:43:14|0:43:22|Upon hearing this news, [Zu'er]'s last glimmer of hope was shattered. Tears kept flowing from his eyes. Seeing this, [Sir Wan] comforted him,
0:43:25|0:43:28|At this moment, the nurse also walked in and spoke to [Sir Wan].
0:43:41|0:43:54|[Zu'er], although [Sir Wan] was full of grief, still obediently nodded to her husband. Then, [Sir Wan] gently kissed his forehead and left the hospital. Unexpectedly, after [Sir Wan] left, [Zu'er] cried even more sadly.
0:43:54|0:44:10|He looked at the pen in his hand, recalling the scene of cutting the pen for his brother [A Hua] in the restaurant. He concluded that it was his brother [A Hua] who killed his student. Caught between love and justice, [Zu'er] found himself in a dilemma. After finishing the examination and returning to the ward, the nurse said.
0:44:16|0:44:27|As the story progresses, [Zu'er] looks towards the man by the window, only to find that it is [A Hua]. [Zu'er] angrily throws the flowers in his face.
0:45:6|0:45:23|[A Hua] said as he took out a dozen of checks from his suit pocket, flipping to the page he had prepared in advance. He deliberately walked up to [Zu'er] and signed his name. Upon closer inspection, the amount on the check was in the millions, as [A Hua] intended to dilute the tension in this way.
0:45:47|0:45:53|A Hua, who was chased out of the ward, collided head-on with Sir Wan who had just arrived. The nurse and Sir Wan hurriedly inquired about Zu'er's condition.
0:45:56|0:46:5|After the events of the day, [A Hua] was restless at night, so he called [Da Sha] to discuss.
0:46:32|0:46:34|[Sir Wan] arrived at his father's house.
0:47:0|0:47:2|Indeed, A Hua has also returned home.
0:47:19|0:47:24|He always loses his temper, his father remained silent while drinking tea after hearing it, [Sir Wan] continued to ask.
0:48:29|0:48:44|Due to the discovery of an unidentified corpse at sea, the serious crime unit led by [Sir Wan] came to check if the body was Tan Lin. At this moment, [Sir Wan] also arrived in time, without even locking his car, and hurried towards the seaside. He saw [Colleague] and asked.
0:49:10|0:49:21|[Zu'er], who has been discharged from the hospital, still has some injuries on her face, but her spirits have improved a lot. After finishing the household chores, [Zu'er] is tinkering with decorations at home, waiting for her husband to return. Just then, the doorbell at home suddenly rang.
0:49:24|0:49:38|[Zu'er] heard the doorbell and thought it was [Sir Wan] coming back, so he immediately put down the decoration in his hand and opened the door with a smile. To his surprise, the visitor turned out to be his brother [A Hua]. What's even more surprising is that [A Hua] was accompanied by [Da Sha] and three henchmen.
0:49:38|0:49:44|[A Hua] saw [Zu'er] without saying a word, while [Da Sha] and his men barged into Brother Cheng's room and started searching.
0:49:45|0:49:50|[A Hua] skillfully pulls the curtains closed, at this moment, [Sir Wan] and his father arrive at the underground garage.
0:50:2|0:50:13|[Zu'er] was pushed aside heavily by his subordinates, then quickly rummaged through the cabinet. Although [Zu'er] was [A Hua]'s sister, his subordinates showed no mercy. So [Zu'er] found [A Hua] and spoke to him.
0:50:38|0:50:45|The two people on the left didn't say a word, and one of them picked up the phone to make a call. Before his hand could reach the phone, he was fiercely poked by [Da Sha]'s cigarette butt.
0:51:17|0:51:21|[A Hua] stopped [Da Sha] and then bent down beside Zu'er.
0:51:53|0:52:7|[A Hua] hugged [Da Sha] from behind, but [Da Sha] kicked [Zu'er] and sent her flying into the fish tank. In an instant, the water in the fish tank mixed with the electric wires, and Zu'er was electrocuted on the spot. [A Hua] looked blankly at Zu'er with a bewildered expression.
0:52:10|0:52:24|After causing a big trouble, the group had no time to search for the film negatives, and hurriedly left Zuo'er's house. They even dared not take the elevator, but walked towards the fire escape on the side. At that moment, the father, who had taken the elevator first, came out and returned home to witness this scene.
0:52:26|0:52:33|Father Wan, ignoring the danger, rushed to Zu'er's side to help him up, but a huge electric current instantly threw him out.
0:52:41|0:52:56|[A Hua] shook off the entanglement of [Da Sha] and drove away from the underground garage. Fortunately, his father was also a gangster when he was young, with excellent physical fitness. After being shocked, he had no major problems and got up to run towards the garage. At this time, [Da Sha] also brought his little brothers, got in the car, and prepared to leave.
0:52:56|0:53:4|Father flips and jumps in the stairwell, reaching the next floor in a few seconds, while [Da Sha] is stuck in traffic, impatiently urging his younger brother.
0:53:8|0:53:10|At this moment, Sir Wan also returned home.
0:53:23|0:53:45|Because [Da Sha]'s car kept honking impatiently, the car in front accelerated and got into an accident at the intersection.
0:53:51|0:54:4|Two henchmen got out of the car aggressively and walked towards the driver. With the help of the two henchmen, the driver quickly turned the tables. However, the two drivers were also tough guys, refusing to give up even after being beaten. The three-on-two battle reached a stalemate for a while.
0:54:9|0:54:27|Da Sha, who was trying to escape in a car, had just gotten out and taken a few steps when Brother Cheng kicked him flying with a powerful kick, sending him several meters away. In a sorry state, he even knocked over a hand and foot stand as he tried to get up. As soon as he stood up, Brother Cheng grabbed him by the collar and delivered two heavy blows to his head, followed by two explosive punches. Then he was thrown heavily against the wall. Da Sha was repeatedly punched hard, lying on the ground with his teeth scattered around.
0:54:27|0:54:42|But [Brother Cheng] did not give up easily, and continued to prepare to beat up [Da Sha]. However, as soon as he approached, he was struck by a shovel wielded by an incoming henchman. [Brother Cheng] fought back while retreating, constantly dodging the shovel attacks. At this moment, the other two henchmen also finished dealing with the car owner and joined in attacking [Brother Cheng].
0:54:43|0:54:58|Brother Cheng quickly adjusted his position, knocking out a henchman to use as a shield, while the others hesitated and were each taken down by Brother Cheng. After getting up, Brother Cheng did not linger in the fight, but instead decisively chased after Da Sha. Brother Cheng grabbed a cement-filled cart and desperately rammed it towards Da Sha.
0:54:58|0:55:10|Da Sha hurriedly flipped over the car, avoiding the impact of the small cart. Brother Cheng, seeing this, grabbed the fire axe nearby and swung it towards Da Sha. After kicking Da Sha down, Brother Cheng then raised the axe high above his head, preparing to deliver a fatal blow.
0:55:10|0:55:23|Unexpectedly, when the axe fell, it first hit the fire sprinkler, and [Da Sha] took the opportunity to escape. The younger brothers all surrounded them at this time. When [Brother Cheng] fought back, he did not use the axe to hit the younger brothers. Da Sha ran desperately all the way, from the underground parking lot to the street.
0:55:23|0:55:38|Brother Cheng, with an angry glare, chased after with an axe in hand. The henchmen who tried to stop him were knocked down one by one. Several of them ran through the street without fear of passing vehicles. Da Sha ran desperately, but when he looked back after a while, he found that he still couldn't shake off Brother Cheng.
0:55:38|0:55:47|Da Sha ran towards the crowded sidewalk. The slowed-down Da Sha was chopped in the back by [Brother Cheng]. At this moment, a concerned citizen quickly found a police officer to explain the situation.
0:55:50|0:56:9|The police arrived just in time to see [Brother Cheng] wielding an axe and charging towards Da Sha. Seizing the opportunity, [Brother Cheng] struck Da Sha heavily with the axe. The police fired a warning shot into the air, but Chen Ge, who had lost his daughter in old age, had already disregarded life and death, paying no attention to the police.
0:56:9|0:56:18|The police officer reluctantly shot Chen Ge in the leg, finally calming down the chase. Upon receiving the news, [Sir Wan] hurried to the police station to inquire about the situation.
0:56:29|0:56:34|According to Uncle Chen, that guy appeared at the scene of the murder, and Leader Wensheng rushed over.
0:57:5|0:57:9|[Sir Wan] ignored the lawyer and walked straight to the leader's office.
0:57:14|0:57:18|Shortly after, [Da Sha] walked towards the door with a look of defiance on his face, accompanied by the lawyer.
0:57:39|0:57:41|He is a key figure in this murder case.
0:58:1|0:58:17|[Sir Wan] shouted "Yeah!" to express his dissatisfaction. In just a few days, [Da Sha], who had bribed the witness, was acquitted. Outside the courthouse, reporters swarmed around. [Da Sha] remained silent in the face of reporters' questions, swaggering down the courthouse steps.
0:58:17|0:58:24|At this moment, [Sir Wan] walked up from the other side of the steps. Upon seeing [Sir Wan], [Da Sha] stopped in his tracks. [Sir Wan].
0:58:42|0:58:56|[Sir Wan] reluctantly took a step back. Persuaded by colleagues, [Sir Wan] reluctantly left at that moment.
0:59:5|0:59:15|[A Hua] was still furious. He looked at [Da Sha], who was covering his nose, ready to make another move, but was forcefully knocked down by the bodyguards next to him. They then pinned [A Hua] onto the car, and [Da Sha] said to him.
0:59:39|0:59:47|In the evening, Da Sha, A Hua, and others were drinking in a private room at Ye's Club. Policewoman Ah Min disguised herself as a waitress and installed a bug under the guise of delivering a fruit bowl.
1:0:5|1:0:11|At this moment, Brother Ji outside the door of Sir Wan's office was eavesdropping on every move inside the private room.
1:0:55|1:1:5|After listening to Boss Cao's words, [A Hua] and [Da Sha] exchanged a glance and knew that they couldn't delay any longer. Despite being watched by the police, [A Hua] still agreed under the temptation of money.
1:1:18|1:1:32|Although they overheard the conversation of several people, how could the few who have been in the rivers and lakes for years openly discuss drugs in a nightclub? The police officers with listening devices installed, including [Da Sha], were unable to obtain crucial evidence until they left.
1:1:32|1:1:41|Sir Wan, who was forced to take a vacation, sat alone in the empty house. He looked at the room where he had lived with Zu'er for many years, and a sense of sadness surrounded him.
1:1:46|1:1:54|As a police officer, Sir Wan has never felt so powerless. At this moment, the doorbell rings, and Sir Wan opens the door slowly, like a walking dead.
1:1:58|1:2:7|[Sir Wan] signed the document wearily and closed the door. He couldn't get over the fact that [Zu'er] had passed away. He didn't want to communicate with the outside world, so he didn't say a word to the delivery man.
1:2:7|1:2:17|After he opened the envelope, it was the film that [Zu'er] refused to hand over even in death. Feeling frustrated, [Sir Wan] didn't feel like looking at it, but the police intuition made him feel that this roll of film was not simple.
1:2:18|1:2:33|[Sir Wan] looked at the dark negatives, but couldn't directly see the content of the photos. So he went out and went to the printing shop to print out the photos. As he flipped through them one by one, he happened to see the photo of Tan Lin's body taken by Huang Zhiqiang in the cabin.
1:2:33|1:2:40|He immediately took off his sunglasses and looked carefully. After confirming the content, he visited his father in prison, and his father comforted him when he saw him.
1:3:31|1:3:39|[Sir Wan] handed the prepared photo to his father when he noticed his father lost in thought, and then continued to analyze in front of his father.
1:4:52|1:5:3|Coincidentally, just as the father was pondering, [A Hua] also came to visit him. Upon seeing [A Hua], [Sir Wan] knew that his visiting time had come to an end, so he tactfully walked out on his own.
1:5:4|1:5:10|[Sir Wan] stood outside the door, ignoring [A Hua], and watched [A Hua]'s every move with moist eyes.
1:7:9|1:7:14|Brother Cheng is Sir Wan's brother in the Jianghu, and they are planning to stage a fake injury scheme together.
1:7:14|1:7:30|Just as [Brother Cheng] was taking a shower, three henchmen suddenly rushed in from outside. One used a towel to strangle [Brother Cheng]'s neck, while the other two used toothbrushes as weapons to stab him. Caught off guard by the surprise attack, the seasoned [Brother Cheng] was unable to fight back and was quickly knocked unconscious. Fortunately, a fellow inmate called the prison guard for help.
1:7:37|1:7:52|Soon, the severely injured [Brother Cheng] was urgently taken to the hospital by the prison vehicle. Lying on a stretcher, [Brother Cheng] with an oxygen mask on fell into a coma, while the accompanying doctor kept a close eye on his condition. However, the prison guard in the vehicle was careless and started to doze off.
1:7:52|1:7:54|When the car drove to the outskirts, [Brother Cheng] suddenly woke up and started shaking.
1:7:59|1:8:10|Just then, [Brother Cheng] took off the oxygen mask, suddenly got up and knocked the doctor unconscious to the side. The awakened prison guard had just opened his eyes and hadn't figured out the situation yet, when he was kicked out of the car by [Brother Cheng].
1:8:10|1:8:22|The poor prison guard was rolling on the ground, but luckily not in danger of losing his life. [Brother Cheng] also took the opportunity to jump out of the police car and escape into the nearby woods. Soon, Wang Yongqiang heard the news of his father's escape on TV.
1:8:36|1:8:41|Upon hearing this, Wang Yongqiang lowered his head in contemplation. At this moment, the leader in the police station called for a meeting and said,
1:8:47|1:8:49|The first thing he does when he comes out is to look for [Da Sha].
1:9:0|1:9:8|Captain Chen, at night, [Da Sha] returned home and saw a police car at the door, so he bluntly asked.
1:9:26|1:9:41|After [Da Sha] smugly taunted, he instructed his henchman to step on the gas and drive into the luxury mansion. The police officers at the entrance were very displeased with [Da Sha], but could only grit their teeth. After parking the car at the entrance, [Da Sha] smugly got out of the car, with two young women by his side.
1:10:3|1:10:21|At that moment, the wooden door of the room was instantly shattered by a shotgun, and [Brother Cheng] kicked the door, aiming a shot at [Da Sha]. However, [Da Sha] reacted quickly, leaping and crashing through the glass to escape the room. The henchmen pulled out their guns to retaliate, but before they could aim properly, [Brother Cheng] took them all out with a single shot each, and he continued the pursuit.
1:10:25|1:10:34|But the police were all colleagues of [Sir Wan], and they didn't immediately shoot when they saw [Brother Cheng]. [Brother Cheng] was well aware of this, so he ignored them and chased after [Da Sha] who was running away.
1:10:34|1:10:42|[Da Sha] ran all the way to the edge of the swimming pool, seeing no way out in front of him, he jumped directly into the pool. At this moment, a large number of special police officers who had received the notification also arrived outside the mansion.
1:10:48|1:10:55|[Da Sha] held his breath, hiding at the bottom of the pool, afraid to show his head. [Brother Cheng] angrily fired shots at the water surface, when suddenly, the special police arrived.
1:10:58|1:11:7|Brother Cheng, in a hurry, fired underwater without hesitation. After two gunshots, he found that the gun was out of bullets. At this moment, the special police also started firing at Brother Cheng.
1:11:7|1:11:25|Brother Cheng quickly hid in the woods upon seeing the situation. Fortunately, under the cover of night, the special police failed to hit Brother Cheng. Sir Wan's colleagues arrived in time to rescue Da Sha. Brother Cheng was about to use a handgun to continue shooting at Da Sha, but he was suddenly taken away by a masked person.
1:11:31|1:11:49|Afterwards, [Sir Wan]'s colleagues quietly searched for Brother Cheng's whereabouts in the woods. Meanwhile, Brother Cheng had already been taken to a safe location by a masked man on a motorcycle. However, upon entering the room, they discovered that the masked man was actually [Sir Wan]. He cautiously closed the door, drew the curtains, and then turned around to ask.
1:13:2|1:13:19|[Sir Wan] slowly got up and walked to his father's side, gently placing his hand on his shoulder, comforting him. Just then, the doorbell suddenly rang.
1:13:27|1:13:32|[Sir Wan] saw his father entering the bedroom, he peeked through the peephole and confirmed it was his colleague before opening the door.
1:13:46|1:13:52|Brother Wang sat nervously in the bedroom, looking around helplessly, then he heard several people discussing in the living room.
1:14:4|1:14:9|At this moment, [Ah Min] took out a black box and handed it to [Sir Wan], saying to him.
1:14:30|1:14:37|After listening to the content of the recording, everyone present fell silent. In the bedroom, [Brother Cheng] was even more emotionally exhausted upon hearing it.
1:14:54|1:14:59|Sir Wan was not in the mood to joke with his colleagues at the moment, as pointed out by A Min.
1:15:5|1:15:11|[Ami] was cleaning up the room when she accidentally saw a newspaper with "123 Clean Hong Kong Grand Action" written on it.
1:15:19|1:15:32|The father overheard the conversation of several people clearly, and the next day, [A Hua] and others contacted Boss Cao. [Da Sha] and [A Hua] and others disguised as primary school teachers, they casually got off the bus.
1:16:28|1:16:47|Boss Cao and [Da Sha] watched with satisfaction as the elementary school students worked hard to collect all the drugs into garbage bags. Little did they know, [Sir Wan] had already brought people to observe them in secret. The innocent students and teachers were unaware that they had become tools.
1:16:58|1:17:14|At this moment, Wang Yongqiang inadvertently saw Brother Cheng holding a pistol, also lurking on the side. While colleagues were still puzzled, Wang Yongqiang had already rushed to Brother Cheng's side.
1:17:30|1:17:43|In the face of the son-in-law's obstruction, [Brother Cheng] hesitated. Unexpectedly, just as [Brother Cheng] hesitated, Wang Yongqiang suddenly made a move against his father. He first snatched the father's gun, then mercilessly knocked him down, followed by a blow that knocked his father unconscious.
1:17:45|1:17:55|Wang Yongqiang put handcuffs on his father. Meanwhile, in order to make the performance more realistic, [Da Sha] even prepared ice cream and drinks for the students.
1:18:2|1:18:12|After collecting the drugs, the henchmen brought the drugs in front of [Da Sha] and [A Hua]. [A Hua] looked at them with great satisfaction and nodded to his henchmen, indicating the success of their transaction.
1:18:12|1:18:24|Meanwhile, Brother Cheng, who was knocked unconscious by Sir Wan, gradually regained consciousness, but the handcuffs on his hands restrained him. At this moment, Da Sha and Mr. Cao and others arrived at the table, each opening a bottle of drink, celebrating in advance.
1:18:30|1:18:33|Just then, [Sir Wan]'s [colleague] suddenly arrived.
1:18:55|1:19:3|The police immediately opened the boxes held by a few henchmen, only to find brand new hundred-dollar bills inside, and quickly reported to [Sir Wan].
1:19:24|1:19:41|Sir Wan rushed to the beach to check the situation as described by the old leaf. He watched as the elementary school students dragged bag after bag of garbage towards the recycling point, but he couldn't see any clues at the moment. As an experienced detective, Sir Wan knew that this matter was not simple. However, looking at the different types of garbage bags all over the beach, he also felt puzzled for a moment.
1:19:41|1:19:48|At this moment, some fine powder was exposed in a primary school student's garbage bag. Lao Ye pinched a bit and found out it was drugs.
1:19:48|1:20:1|He was about to report when he was unexpectedly shot in the arm. The peaceful and cheerful beach just now turned into a battlefield with bullets flying everywhere. Upon seeing this, [Sir Wan] quickly shouted.
1:20:1|1:20:17|Da Sha kicked over the dining table, took out the machine gun that was placed behind the table in advance, and his men started shooting wildly after grabbing their guns. Sir Wan and his team quickly fought back, but at this moment, the beach was filled with fleeing students, teachers, and tourists. Sir Wan quickly shouted to the other police officers.
1:20:25|1:20:39|The henchmen threw a large amount of cash into the air. The tourists who were just scared and covering their heads, upon seeing the money, were no longer afraid of the robbers shooting and rushed forward. At this moment, all they could see in their eyes were the banknotes. In the blink of an eye, the road was already crowded and impassable.
1:20:48|1:21:6|[Sir Wan] led the team to continue chasing the thugs. As they got closer, the thugs turned around and started shooting indiscriminately. [Sir Wan] quickly commanded the team to fire back. The thugs shot at [Sir Wan], but he reacted swiftly by lying on the ground and then turning around to kill two of them. Meanwhile, [A Hua] and Xiao Wang caught up with Boss Cao.
1:21:8|1:21:15|The two fired their guns, killing the henchman holding the money box. The bandit, enraged, retaliated. Xiao Wang immediately tackled [Ah Min], but he was also hit.
1:21:20|1:21:38|After Boss Cao shook off the police, Jimang and his henchman ran towards a nearby sedan. [Ah Min] scrambled away, and Jimang adjusted his posture and shot at the two, but they were too agile and managed to get into the car. Even so, [Ah Min] did not give up. He ran directly towards a side alley, where the two men's vehicle had just stalled.
1:21:39|1:21:55|[Brother Cheng] disregarded the danger and jumped directly onto the roof of the car. However, the smooth roof did not provide him with any leverage, and soon he slipped off the roof. Just as he was about to fall off the car, [Brother Cheng] grabbed onto the rear bumper of the vehicle, and his body was dragged along by the car. Shortly after, the driver used a front oil drum to shake him off, but [Brother Cheng] ignored the chest pain.
1:21:55|1:22:5|Rising quickly and shooting, a precise shot blew up the car's fuel tank, causing the car to burst into flames instantly. After driving for a few seconds, it suddenly exploded, leaving Boss Cao and his henchman trapped in the car.
1:22:5|1:22:14|On the other side, [Sir Wan] chased [Da Sha] and [A Hua] into an abandoned building, where they ran and shot at each other without hitting. Meanwhile, [Brother Cheng] also sneaked into the building.
1:22:16|1:22:31|A Hua swiftly climbed upstairs after hearing, while Da Sha hid in the room, observing Sir Wan through the window. The room Da Sha entered happened to be where Brother Cheng was hiding. Seeing Da Sha coming in, unarmed Brother Cheng quietly hid behind a wooden board.
1:22:31|1:22:38|[Da Sha] smashed the glass, extended the machine gun out of the window, aiming towards [Sir Wan], while [Brother Cheng] held his breath, slowly moving his body inch by inch.
1:22:39|1:22:54|With his left hand pinned against the water pipe by [Sir Wan], [Brother Cheng] had to be careful of the sound of the handcuffs. At this moment, [Da Sha] saw [Sir Wan] and decisively opened fire. [Sir Wan], who was agile but not powerful, first dodged, then took advantage of the gap in [Da Sha]'s attack to fly to the other side.
1:22:54|1:23:5|Unexpectedly, [A Hua] on the roof suddenly opened fire at him. In order to break free from the handcuffs, [Brother Cheng] endured the intense pain and prepared to forcibly remove the handcuffs. However, the sound of the handcuffs rubbing against the bones was still heard by [Da Sha].
1:23:6|1:23:20|[Da Sha] cautiously walked towards [Brother Cheng] with a machine gun in hand. At this moment, [Brother Cheng]'s hands were already bloody from the handcuffs. In this life-and-death moment, [Brother Cheng] roared, broke free from the handcuffs, then swiftly crashed through the wooden board, knocking [Da Sha] down to the ground.
1:23:20|1:23:33|At this moment, outside the building, [Sir Wan] heard the commotion and quietly changed his position. Just as he moved to the window where [Da Sha] was, preparing to shoot, he suddenly saw [Brother Cheng] beating up [Da Sha]. He accidentally shot [Brother Cheng], then put away his gun and ran into the building.
1:23:33|1:23:50|As they entered the building, a fierce gunfight broke out between [A Hua] and [Sir Wan]. Despite A Hua wielding a submachine gun, he couldn't suppress the anger burning inside [Sir Wan]. After a burst of gunfire from A Hua, he quickly ducked into the hallway. When he chased [Yongqiang] around the corner into the hallway, he found it empty.
1:23:50|1:24:4|Sir Wan instantly became more alert when he couldn't see anyone, holding a handgun and slowly feeling his way forward. There were dozens of windows on both sides of the corridor. As Sir Wan cautiously looked around, A Hua had quietly extended a submachine gun upstairs and aimed at him.
1:24:4|1:24:13|A Hua ruthlessly pulled the trigger, luckily Sir Wan reacted in time, quickly dodged and counterattacked. Fortunately, the bullet only grazed Sir Wan's arm.
1:24:13|1:24:29|In the building, [Da Sha] was kicked away by [Brother Cheng], who immediately rushed over to continue the beating. However, [Da Sha] picked up a brick, swung it back to push [Brother Cheng] aside, then quickly crawled out and grabbed a machine gun to shoot wildly. At this moment, [Brother Cheng] leaped forward, knocked down the machine gun, and then kicked [Da Sha], causing him to spit out blood.
1:24:29|1:24:45|But [Brother Cheng] was also hit in the leg by machine gun fire. With strong willpower, [Brother Cheng] leaned against the wall and stood up, walking towards [Da Sha]. On the other side, [Sir Wan], who was chasing after A Hua, also found himself in a difficult situation. He chased all the way until he walked into a dark room, with only a few small windows around letting in faint light.
1:24:45|1:24:47|At that moment, he also dared not pursue recklessly.
1:24:48|1:25:4|Just then, hiding in the shadows, [A Hua] suddenly emerged from the haystacks, spraying in the direction of [Sir Wan], causing him to somersault forward from the doorway to the corner of the room, concealing himself. Seizing the opportunity, he aimed and fired in one swift motion, hitting [A Hua] directly in the abdomen.
1:25:4|1:25:17|Shortly after, [Sir Wan] cleverly hid behind the wall, ready to strike at any moment. When there was no sound for a while, he decisively followed out, a beam of light shone in, revealing a passage leading straight to the roof. Without hesitation, [Sir Wan] went straight up to the roof.
1:25:23|1:25:36|On the other side, due to Brother Cheng's arms and legs being severely injured, the advantage in the battle has shifted to Da Sha. Da Sha keeps smashing Brother Cheng with a thick wooden stake, while Brother Cheng, with limited mobility, can only endure each heavy blow with his body.
1:25:36|1:25:47|Finally, [Brother Cheng] seized the opportunity when [Da Sha] attacked, and tightly bound [Da Sha]'s waist. Unable to fully utilize the wooden stake in his hand, [Da Sha] threw it away and resorted to striking [Brother Cheng] with his elbow.
1:25:47|1:25:57|Brother Cheng, although unable to use his hands and feet, opened his mouth and fiercely bit down on Da Sha's stomach. Da Sha screamed in pain, hurriedly threw Brother Cheng against the wall, forcing him to let go.
1:25:58|1:26:13|After Sir Wan reached the rooftop, he didn't find any trace of A Hua. He cautiously moved along the possible path A Hua might have taken on the roof, trying his best to make no sound. Little did he know, A Hua was actually hiding beneath the roof.
1:26:14|1:26:30|[A Hua] heard the noise and immediately started shooting towards the roof. [Sir Wan] hurriedly tried to dodge, but accidentally fell off the roof and landed right into a pigeon cage. Startled by the commotion, the pigeons inside the cage flapped around wildly, creating a flurry of feathers and birds that made it impossible for [Sir Wan] to see the situation outside.
1:26:31|1:26:46|He fumbled in the cage, trying to find the door to get out, while at this moment, Brother Cheng was already beaten by Da Sha, barely holding on with the anger of avenging his daughter. Da Sha then picked up the rope on the ground, put it around Brother Cheng's neck, preparing to strangle him.
1:26:46|1:26:55|[Sir Wan] happened to see this scene at the edge of the cage, so he made a flying leap and smashed the cage, rolling from the top floor to the ground. He fired two shots at [Da Sha] and killed him directly.
1:26:56|1:27:14|Just then, [A Hua] behind [Sir Wan] shot his gun hand. [A Hua] ruthlessly fired, hitting [Sir Wan]'s limbs repeatedly.
1:27:14|1:27:21|Just as [A Hua] was about to shoot Sir Wan, a tearing pain in his abdomen made him look at his father in disbelief.
1:27:25|1:27:40|In this way, Brother Cheng, in order to save Sir Wan, personally fired the gun to end the crimes of Zu'er's son, A Hua. Watching A Hua fall from the roof, Brother Cheng's heart was filled with immense pain, constantly muttering A Hua's name, but the sadness made his throat unable to produce any sound.
1:27:43|1:27:51|Although suffering a great loss, Brother Cheng and son-in-law Sir Wan successfully dismantled the drug trafficking group in Hong Kong, finally avenging their daughter themselves.
