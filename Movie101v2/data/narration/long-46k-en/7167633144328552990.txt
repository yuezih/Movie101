0:0:24|0:0:43|We see a hand picking up the lipstick on the table, following the movement of the camera, we see the woman in the mirror, with the lipstick in her hand, applying it.
0:0:44|0:1:0|After pursing her lips, she looked at herself in the mirror, tidied up her hair and bow tie, and then smiled satisfactorily. As the bell rang, Ren Changxia picked up the embroidered token and the embroidered hat on the table, dressed neatly, looked at herself in the mirror, and let out a sigh.
0:1:11|0:1:23|At this moment, a little girl practicing boxing appears on the screen. She swings her arms, constantly changing her movements back and forth, with each punch and kick being powerful and vigorous. The scene then shifts to a group of police officers.
0:1:27|0:1:45|Before long, another boy appeared next to the little girl. The girl was crouching on the ground, while the boy leaped over smoothly and jumped to the side. The police officers in the scene were running uniformly, followed by the powerful shouts of the children. Many children's training figures appeared in the scene.
0:1:46|0:1:55|The leading little girl was seen changing actions back and forth in front, while the other children followed behind. Their movements were neat and powerful.
0:1:55|0:2:13|On the other side, on the morning street, a group of police officers in uniform ran slowly, shouting slogans continuously. Their feet kept moving forward, while the training figures of the children alternated with the running figures of the police officers. The scene gradually faded away in the slogans and the orderly footsteps.
0:2:14|0:2:31|When the screen lights up again, a rugged country road appears in front. The text below indicates that this is Henan on April 13, 2004. In the distance, a truck with its headlights on slowly approaches, then suddenly stops. The driver in the truck looks ahead and speaks.
0:2:43|0:3:6|The crowd quickly gathered together as the criminals continued to chase the two. The driver lay motionless on the ground, and the scene shifted with a whistle sound, followed by shouts from the surroundings. The police officers in the viewing stand looked towards the direction with some talking and laughing.
0:3:20|0:3:36|In the distance, a fierce tug-of-war competition is taking place among the crowd, with the surrounding police officers cheering them on. The police officers around are holding signs standing next to the teams, with the signs reading "Summit Challenge Team".
0:3:36|0:3:43|At this moment, the woman from the beginning of the film appears on the screen, seen grabbing the gun from the police officer next to her and waving it around.
0:3:57|0:4:12|Then, [Niu Dong] ran to the tug-of-war team and grabbed the rope, shouting encouragement and pulling the rope backwards. Despite [Niu Dong]'s efforts to pull the rope, the flag in the center of the rope gradually moved closer to the opposite side, and the teammates behind him stepped over the dividing line one by one.
0:4:12|0:4:16|Soon, cheers erupted around them, and [Niu Dong] looked around and said,
0:4:29|0:4:34|The woman is walking towards the car, and she is [Ren Changxia].
0:5:7|0:5:13|[Ren Changxia] didn't wait for Xiao Wang to finish speaking, she took out her phone from her pocket and made a call. Xiao Wang beside her looked helpless.
0:5:30|0:5:35|Soon after, [Liu Liangeng] hastily opened the door and got into the car. Before long, the car was driving on the highway.
0:5:48|0:5:58|[Ren Changxia] hung up the phone, looked out the car window, and the scene then shifted to her home. The mother fed the medicine in her hand to the father.
0:6:6|0:6:8|Later, he wiped the water off the father's neck for him.
0:6:27|0:6:35|I'll take it. Ren Changxia then turned and picked up the phone.
0:7:48|0:8:3|Ah, after hearing the news, [Ren Changxia] in the car smiled and hung up the phone, then slowly turned her head to look out the window. On the highway, her car was still speeding, the friction between the tires and the ground constantly kicking up dust.
0:8:41|0:8:53|[Ren Changxia] sat in the car, suddenly seemed to remember something. She took out an envelope, extracted a letter from it, and read it with a serious expression. After finishing, she nodded meaningfully, as if understanding something.
0:8:56|0:9:18|Then he picked up the envelope and poured it into his hand, and four bullets slowly slid out of the envelope. [Ren Changxia] was stunned for a moment, then picked up one bullet and placed it by the window to examine it carefully. Xiao Wang, who was looking through the rearview mirror in the car, saw this scene and spoke. [Ren Changxia] smiled and spoke.
0:9:18|0:9:23|The car was still speeding along the highway. Before long, [Ren Changxia] arrived at the scene of the incident.
0:10:6|0:10:10|It is known that the deceased often went to Anping Road, but usually took the main road.
0:10:17|0:10:20|Ren Changxia listened intently and then said, pondering.
0:10:41|0:10:44|Case 126, the first major case listed by the provincial department this year, has not been solved yet.
0:11:9|0:11:12|Then the group stood up, and [Ren Changxia] spoke.
0:11:24|0:11:42|Captain Qiu watched as Ren Changxia walked past him, then reluctantly stood up and followed her. Before long, Ren Changxia reached the car and was about to open the door when she saw many simple villagers standing behind the police cordon not far away. They stared blankly at the crime scene.
0:11:42|0:11:48|[Ren Changxia] then released her hand from the car door and slowly walked towards the villagers. When she reached the villagers, she began to speak.
0:12:14|0:12:39|The man speaking turned his head randomly and left with his companion. [Ren Changxia] lowered her head and took a few more steps, pondering something. Turning to look at [Ren Changxia], he suddenly spoke. "Go ahead, Captain Qiu is taking Ren Changxia away."
0:13:32|0:13:42|Driving from the main road to the side road, according to reports from the public, many cars have been taking the side road recently. What could be the reason for this?
0:14:7|0:14:24|At noon, after finishing the report, Ren Changxia walked alone to the window, bowing her head in contemplation. Then she looked out the window and memories flooded her mind. A man pushed open her office door, walked in without looking at her, and instead gazed at the map on the wall.
0:14:29|0:14:43|Then, she continued to look at the map. At this moment, [Niu Dong] turned around and spoke. [Niu Dong] listened thoughtfully and then spoke.
0:14:58|0:15:8|Then he turned and walked to the door, looking at the person inside the room [Ren Changxia], he knocked on the door. [Niu Dong] stood still after hearing it, lowered his head and smiled.
0:15:10|0:15:28|He then slowly lowered his arm and walked into the room, sitting still on the chair in front of the table. But after sitting down, he crossed his legs and started knocking the pipe slowly. After speaking, he looked across with his chin resting on his hand. Niu Dong laughed and said.
0:15:42|0:15:47|[Niu Dong] smiled, then lowered his head and took out something from his pocket before speaking.
0:15:54|0:16:3|[Ren Changxia] glanced at the money on the table, sneered, and said disdainfully. "This little money," [Niu Dong] responded with a hint of displeasure.
0:16:16|0:16:25|[Ren Changxia] randomly took out a piece of paper and placed it in front of [Niu Dong]. [Niu Dong] smiled and picked up the paper in front of him, only to find the words "Detention Certificate" written on it.
0:16:29|0:16:31|[Niu Dong] stared blankly at the detention certificate at this moment.
0:16:39|0:16:43|[Niu Dong] chuckled tirelessly after hearing it, looking across.
0:17:12|0:17:17|The police then took [Niu Dong] away. The scene flashed back to the window, where [Ren Changxia] was still standing by the window.
0:18:4|0:18:21|[Ren Changxia] walked slowly to the courtyard, took out a tissue from her pocket to wipe away her tears. At that moment, [Captain Qiu] approached. The two then turned and left.
0:18:27|0:18:34|The two of them walked outside while talking, [Ren Changxia] looked pensive after coming down the hall, then took out her phone to make a call.
0:19:1|0:19:9|After speaking, she watched [Captain Qiu] leave, then turned and walked away, only to hear a voice behind her.
0:19:44|0:19:59|[Ren Changxia] stood still, watching the two leave. The scene suddenly shifted, and Chen Ju slowly walked out of the hotel and opened her phone. She then stood still, looking at the text message on her phone, "The 126 police forces you arranged to be transferred have been deployed."
0:20:4|0:20:21|Captain Qiu then turned around and saluted Ren Changxia. After saluting each other again, Captain Qiu turned around and spoke. Ren Changxia took a few steps, turned around, and looked at the rows of police officers in front of her before speaking slowly.
0:21:2|0:21:13|Speak up, the police immediately dispersed in all directions, and the scene gradually faded away. At this moment, two police officers walked out of the telephone hall.
0:21:17|0:21:34|The figures of the two gradually disappeared, and the scene slowly revealed the figures of two other police officers. They passed by the two or three people sitting at the door and walked towards the inside, then they walked into the courtyard and headed towards the house.
0:21:34|0:21:42|Other police officers either just returned and stood by the police car, or walked towards the village in small groups. At this moment, the face of [Ren Changxia] gradually appeared on the screen.
0:23:6|0:23:25|[Ren Changxia] hung up the phone, looked worriedly to the side, pondered for a moment with her head down, and then quickly walked away. Meanwhile, a medium-sized van appeared in the frame and drove off slowly. Inside the van, [Liu Liangeng] was pouring water for [Ren Changxia], while the others sat in the back. Before long, the car arrived on the road.
0:24:11|0:24:15|The ordinary people couldn't get compensation, so they occupied the construction site.
0:24:26|0:24:46|Immediately, [Ren Changxia] turned around and got into the car. Xiao Wang closed the door and started the car, and the two quickly drove away. On the other side, [Zheng Gang] walked out of the police station, approached the police car, opened the door and sat in the passenger seat, then looked at the officers in the car and spoke.
0:24:46|0:24:50|The police officer immediately started the car, and the two of them then left the Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau.
0:24:54|0:25:11|On the other side, the crowd on the hillside is slowly descending, while in the distance, a car is slowly approaching. The crowd immediately starts saying, "Let's go, let's go, let's go."
0:25:42|0:25:45|[Manager Zhao] then took out his phone.
0:26:17|0:26:19|Speak up, Manager Zhao looked at everyone.
0:27:10|0:27:31|At this moment, on the Dengfeng East Expressway, a police car slowly drove out of the toll station and then sped away. On the other side, [Liu Liangeng] and Chen Ju stood at the entrance of the police station, looking into the distance. A police car pulled into the station and slowly stopped in front of the two. They hurried forward to open the car door, and a person got out of the car.
0:27:35|0:27:37|After speaking, the three of them turned and walked into the police station.
0:28:8|0:28:18|[Zheng Gang] stopped walking slowly after listening, raised his hand to look at his watch. He lowered his head in thought for a moment, then spoke again.
0:28:19|0:28:22|After speaking, he looked at [Liu Liangeng] and Director Chen beside him.
0:28:31|0:28:34|The two remained silent after listening. The official finished speaking and then turned and left.
0:30:5|0:30:16|Liu Liangeng finished speaking and looked at Ren Changxia. Suddenly, his phone rang. Ren Changxia glanced at him but didn't say anything. Then, Liu Liangeng took out his phone and gestured to Ren Changxia before turning around and walking out of the meeting room.
0:30:41|0:30:53|The durian soup in the stairwell sighed and hung up the phone. Then, he turned and left the stairwell, while [Ren Changxia] sat in the car, memories from before slowly surfacing in her mind.
0:31:8|0:31:20|The scene now returns to reality, with [Ren Changxia] sitting in the car looking slightly worried. On the other side, [Liu Liangeng] walks slowly into the police station conference room, and [Captain Qiu] sees him coming in and speaks.
0:31:31|0:31:38|Liu Liangeng breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing this, then looked back at the evidence, picked up the water glass on the table and said.
0:32:0|0:32:17|After speaking, he looked at the evidence and smiled. At the same time, on the other side of the road, a car was speeding along, then turned and slowly approached the toll booth, finally stopping behind another car next to the toll booth. [Ren Changxia] got out of the car, put on a police cap, and started talking.
0:34:10|0:34:19|After they finished speaking, the two turned and left. [Ren Changxia] took out her phone and made a call, then she walked slowly towards the car.
0:34:26|0:34:28|The scene changes, and a man walks up to another person.
0:35:0|0:35:3|The man turned his head with a look of hesitation, but quickly spoke again.
0:35:32|0:35:46|The crowd then slowly moved forward, and Uncle Ding's figure appeared among them. He watched as the crowd continued to move forward, then lowered his head and slowly caught up with them. The noisy crowd walked on the road, looking very spectacular.
0:35:46|0:35:52|In the other living room, [Niu Dong] was on the phone with his head down, then he hung up the phone and walked out of the room.
0:36:9|0:36:14|[Ren Changxia] hung up the phone, looked worriedly out the window, and sighed.
0:36:25|0:36:27|[Ren Changxia] frowned at this moment.
0:36:32|0:36:36|[Niu Dong] hung up the phone and looked at the two people beside him, speaking.
0:36:47|0:37:6|The scene then shifts, with the surrounding buildings moving continuously, and the control reception room slowly appearing. Xiao Wang casually turns a corner and parks the car in front of the police station. [Ren Changxia] gets out of the car, takes a glance at the police station in front of her, then anxiously looks to the side before closing the car door and running straight towards the reception room door.
0:39:4|0:39:10|After speaking, the two of them walked away quickly and then ran up the stairs.
0:39:16|0:39:26|Shortly after, Chen Ju and [Liu Liangeng] watched as [Ren Changxia] left. [Ren Changxia] entered the meeting room and saw [Zheng Gang] standing by the window. She saluted and then spoke.
0:39:31|0:39:38|[Zheng Gang] turned around slowly to look at [Ren Changxia]. She put her hands in her pockets, sighed, and then walked away.
0:39:44|0:39:47|After speaking, he walked to the conference table and continued.
0:39:48|0:39:58|Shortly after, he sat down on the chair in front of the table, and [Ren Changxia] walked slowly into the meeting room and sat down, placing his police cap on the table. Captain Qiu looked at him and spoke again.
0:39:59|0:40:3|Ren Changxia on the side took out a notebook and opened it.
0:40:13|0:40:16|Zheng Ju turned and looked at him after listening.
0:40:21|0:40:34|At this moment, Chen Qun, [Liu Liangeng], and Wensheng walked to the office door and looked outside. They didn't find any valuable clues for the time being.
0:40:45|0:40:49|[Ren Changxia] turned her head in silence after hearing, and then said with the evidence.
0:40:52|0:41:1|[Ren Changxia] stood up after hearing it, walked to the door, just closed a door, and heard the evidence. She then stopped what she was doing and pushed open the door.
0:41:6|0:41:13|Then, he walked slowly to the seat and sat down, [Zheng Gang] looked at him sitting down, standing upright and speaking.
0:41:37|0:41:41|Ren Changxia glanced casually elsewhere.
0:42:14|0:42:24|Outside the office door, Chen Ju and Ren Changxia looked slightly worried, while Liu Liangeng turned around and paced back and forth in the office. Chen Ju also turned and walked into the office, continuing to look outside.
0:42:25|0:42:51|Before long, Durian Soup walked to Chen Ju's side, looked outside, took out her phone, and then wrote something with a stylus pen while looking. Chen Ju turned to look at her, at this moment in the meeting room. [Ren Changxia] took out her phone, unlocked it, and opened a message. After reading the message on her phone, she admitted her mistake first before speaking.
0:43:45|0:43:57|[Ren Changxia] listened and then turned around, crying. Chen Ju sighed after listening, and saw that Captain Qiu took out his phone and wrote something with a stylus pen on the touchscreen.
0:44:6|0:44:19|The meeting room was silent at this moment, with only the sound of [Ren Changxia] sobbing. [Liu Liangeng] stood up, walked to the door, closed it, then turned to look at [Ren Changxia] who was still crying, and slowly walked to her side.
0:45:35|0:45:48|After finishing presenting the evidence, [Ren Changxia] stood up, looked ahead thoughtfully, and began to speak. She then lowered her head to search for a photo and handed it to the evidence. The evidence took the photo and said.
0:45:49|0:45:56|Bending down, he placed the photo on the table.
0:46:5|0:46:11|Then, he looked at [Ren Changxia] and placed his hand on her shoulder. [Ren Changxia] wiped away her tears and lowered her head.
0:46:25|0:46:30|[Ren Changxia] stood up quickly. Chen Ju stood outside the door, but didn't speak.
0:46:39|0:46:48|At this moment, a commotion could be heard downstairs. [Ren Changxia] hurried to the window, with Zheng Jiu following closely behind her. Outside the window, a large group of people were slowly walking towards the police station entrance.
0:46:52|0:47:9|[Ren Changxia] finished speaking and then turned to leave, while [Zheng Gang] remained standing by the window, watching the crowd outside. Before long, [Ren Changxia] ran downstairs, took a look at the people around her, and then spoke.
0:47:9|0:47:18|In the crowded room, a banner slowly rose up, with the words: "[Ren Changxia], you've worked hard."
0:47:48|0:48:6|[Ren Changxia] said with tears in her eyes. [Ren Changxia] looked at the villagers in front of her with emotion, while [Captain Qiu] was standing in the meeting room, observing everything. Downstairs, the villagers were putting a headscarf on [Ren Changxia].
0:48:13|0:48:18|The crowd then burst into applause, with laughter and cheers filling the air, and Uncle Ding also smiled among the crowd.
0:48:20|0:48:38|[Ren Changxia] bowed to everyone while speaking, then stood up and smiled at the crowd. At that moment, in the meeting room, Captain Qiu was smiling as he turned away from the window. Meanwhile, downstairs, the villagers surrounded [Ren Changxia] expressing their gratitude continuously, then they turned and slowly walked away.
0:48:38|0:48:43|[Ren Changxia] looked at the villagers with a smile on her face, responding to them while bidding them farewell.
0:48:47|0:49:6|[Ren Changxia] kept waving her arms, smiling as she watched the villagers' figures. After speaking, she looked at the villagers leaving, slowly took off her headscarf, still waving her arms and smiling to bid farewell to them. Then, [Ren Changxia] lowered her head and looked at the headscarf in her hands, lost in thought.
0:49:6|0:49:15|At this moment, a police car slowly came to a stop beside her, and she hurried over. [Ren Changxia] glanced at the scarf in her hand.
0:49:21|0:49:32|After that, Zheng Gang's car slowly drove away. Ren Changxia stood in place, watching Zheng Gang leave, her expression solemn as she sighed, then the scene shifted to the police station meeting room.
0:49:41|0:49:45|After speaking, he looked at Chen Ju and the durian soup.
0:50:9|0:50:11|Ren Changxia turned to Liu Liangeng, looking at Zheng Gang who was speaking.
0:50:49|0:51:6|The scene then shifts to a desolate road, surrounded by a few withered trees and mounds of soil. In the distance, several cars approach, kicking up dust on the road. Soon, the cars that were surrounding them slowly come to a stop, with the other cars also stopping in their tracks.
0:51:6|0:51:12|[Ren Changxia] got off the car, turned around and looked back. At this moment, the others in the car also got off and walked towards her.
0:51:12|0:51:34|You go arrange it first. Okay, [Zheng Gang] gestured to interrupt Chen Ju with his hand, and [Ren Changxia] then opened the door and got into the car. The car quickly drove away, soon reaching a road lined with dead trees on both sides. The speeding car continuously kicked up dust on the road, with a little dog behind the car barking and chasing after it.
0:51:34|0:51:46|Not long after, feeling exhausted, he ran towards another direction. Suddenly, the scene shifted, and [Ren Changxia] was seen walking slowly while carrying something. At that moment, her phone rang, and she answered it as she approached the door of a house.
0:52:20|0:52:31|The young lady, you are so busy. The old lady drags [Ren Changxia] into the house, where she is busy cutting vegetables by the stove.
0:53:55|0:54:1|[Ren Changxia] finished speaking with a smile in her eyes, the fire under the pot was burning brightly at this moment, making her look particularly charming.
0:54:16|0:54:20|The old lady chased to the door and looked into the distance, unable to help but recall the memories from before.
0:55:2|0:55:11|Back to reality, Ren Changxia stood at the door, hesitating to leave. On the other side of the road, a car slowly approached and stopped next to a pedestrian.
0:55:26|0:55:35|[Ren Changxia] finished speaking, then dragged the old man into the car. As the car drove on the road through the fields, [Ren Changxia] looked at the old man and spoke.
0:57:55|0:58:3|The uncle of the big truck appeared in the picture at this time, took the steamed buns, and then the two picked up the chopsticks.
0:58:23|0:58:28|The uncle began to reminisce about the past, and the scene showed a man leaning against a car, who was [Niu Dong].
0:58:34|0:58:36|[Niu Dong] leaned against the car without any reaction.
0:59:6|0:59:13|[Ren Changxia] finished speaking and looked at the old man. The old man sat on the side, still bowing his head in silence.
0:59:26|0:59:39|[Ren Changxia] saw the situation, picked up the bowl and took a sip of porridge, then looked at the old man. Upon hearing this, the old man looked up at [Ren Changxia], then turned his head to look elsewhere.
0:59:47|1:0:10|The uncle nodded in agreement, [Ren Changxia] continued. The scene then shifted to a road, where a car was seen speeding through the night. As the phone rang, [Ren Changxia] appeared on screen taking out a cellphone.
1:0:13|1:0:19|She reached into her pocket and found four bullets in the palm of her hand.
1:0:56|1:1:7|[Ren Changxia] slowly put down her phone and froze. She looked nervous, unable to help but recall something. Sitting beside her, [Niu Dong] slowly opened his eyes, glanced around, and then closed them again.
1:1:24|1:1:30|Ren Changxia took a few steps after listening, Jier turned to look at Niu Dong, and then slowly spoke.
1:1:44|1:1:47|Niu Dong slowly picked up his glasses after hearing this.
1:2:0|1:2:4|[Ren Changxia] sat down immediately, only to see [Niu Dong] looking serious and saying.
1:2:46|1:3:7|Dong Xiaoting walked out of the house and closed the door. On the other side, a car was speeding down the busy street. Before long, the car arrived at a courtyard. After passing by the surrounding police cars, it slowly stopped in front of Ren Changxia.
1:4:8|1:4:19|After speaking, [Liu Liangeng] closed the car door and the car started randomly. He took a few steps, watching the car as it quickly drove out of the gate, then he took out his phone and spoke.
1:4:29|1:4:38|Accompanied by the sound of sirens, several police cars quickly drove out, and on the road, [Ren Changxia] pushed the door open and then closed it.
1:5:59|1:6:13|At this moment, the scene shifts to a stage, where the actors on stage slowly appear with props in hand accompanied by music. Then the four actors around them take a few steps back, facing the center of the stage, and perform in coordination with the actor in the middle of the stage.
1:6:13|1:6:19|Finally, everyone waved their props, and the actor in the center of the stage kicked and turned, then jumped up with props in hand.
1:6:20|1:6:36|The audience in the theater cheered loudly. At this moment, a car slowly approached from a distance and came to a stop. On the stage, an actor was flipping his body in the air, while two others next to him were engaged in a fight using props. The crowd below clapped and cheered, with Ren Changxia also among the people.
1:6:37|1:6:47|Ren Changxia was watching the performance with great interest. A man in a suit walked up to a car parked on the side of the road, leaned in towards the driver's seat, pointed at something, and whispered to the driver.
1:6:47|1:6:57|Shortly after, the driver raised his hand, and the man sitting in the passenger seat immediately got out of the car. The man in the suit then walked to the man's side, raised his hand and pointed to the side. After a brief conversation, the two of them walked into the crowd below the stage.
1:6:57|1:7:16|On the other side, on the road, a police car is speeding. Before long, [Captain Qiu] opens the door and gets out of the car to look into the distance. Meanwhile, below the stage, the man in a suit is momentarily attracted by the performance on stage. After applauding, the two of them weave through the crowded people. At this moment, [Niu Dong] turns his head to look elsewhere, then turns around and leaves.
1:7:16|1:7:31|Before long, he climbed up a ladder and kept clapping his hands. At this moment, the man in a suit in the crowd pointed to another direction. The two of them then walked through the crowd towards somewhere else. On the other side, [Maomao] was watching the performance on the stage attentively.
1:7:31|1:7:51|The stage is lively with drumming and gonging, actors constantly changing positions, dancing to the music, drawing cheers from the audience below. At this moment, two men in suits suddenly appear in the crowd next to [Ren Changxia]. [Ren Changxia] on the stairs immediately turns around and looks around.
1:7:56|1:8:16|At this moment, several police officers appeared in the crowd. The man in a suit in the crowd looked at [Mao Mao], then turned and left. Meanwhile, the actors on the stage also stopped their movements. The scene shifted, showing [Ren Changxia] hurriedly running down the stairs. She then ran through the lobby to the door, and hurriedly ran down the steps in front of her.
1:8:16|1:8:22|At this moment, a police car slowly stopped in front of her, then [Captain Qiu] got out of the car.
1:8:28|1:8:33|[Captain Qiu] smiled at [Ren Changxia], and she finally turned around to open the back seat door.
1:10:5|1:10:9|The two then got up and left, [Ren Changxia] looked back at [Liu Liangeng] and smiled.
1:10:32|1:10:40|Then, the shop assistant walked up to [Ren Changxia] and said. [Ren Changxia] turned around and glanced back after hearing it.
1:11:26|1:11:34|To take a family photo, [Ren Changxia] smiled awkwardly after hearing the suggestion.
1:11:42|1:11:44|Liu Liangeng looked at Ren Changxia as he spoke.
1:12:7|1:12:9|After speaking, [Niu Dong] patted [Liu Liangeng].
1:14:18|1:14:35|After saying goodbye, [Ren Changxia] waved to her family and the car started to drive away. She stood in place, watching the car for a long time without leaving. Soon, a police officer got out of the car parked nearby. [Ren Changxia] immediately turned around and walked over to speak.
1:14:39|1:14:51|At night on the main street, a car slowly approaches. Soon, as the car turns a corner, a figure appears on the side. The car slowly stops, and the figure takes a few steps forward.
1:15:17|1:15:24|Several cars started and drove out of the gate. As the camera slowly moved, several police officers led the criminals out of the house.
1:15:44|1:15:47|At this moment, a police car slowly approaches and comes to a stop in the distance.
1:16:24|1:16:30|[Ren Changxia] then looked to the side and saw a woman with tears in her eyes, holding a crying child.
1:16:51|1:17:20|The child in her arms was crying incessantly. Upon seeing this, [Ren Changxia] immediately turned and opened the car door. Subsequently, the criminal slowly turned around, bent his knees and knelt on the ground. Meanwhile, the child in the woman's arms continued to cry non-stop, tears streaming from the child's eyes. After a while, the criminal on the ground slowly began to speak.
1:17:36|1:17:42|After speaking, the criminal recalled, and the image of [Niu Dong] appeared. [Niu Dong] was seen walking with his subordinates, suddenly turning his head.
1:18:38|1:19:5|After finishing speaking, she slowly took off her police cap, wiped the tears from her face, and then said. Xiao Wang immediately started the car, and then drove on the road in the village. The clock on the wall was approaching one o'clock in the morning, and the police officers inside the house sat at the table. Then, [Ren Changxia] slowly spoke.
1:19:9|1:19:14|Beside, Liu Liangeng put down his pen as he heard it, and his notebook opened.
1:20:12|1:20:17|After everyone fell silent upon hearing this, [Ren Changxia] looked at them and then spoke.
1:20:23|1:20:38|In the blink of an eye, it was past two in the morning. [Ren Changxia] was standing in front of the case analysis, looking at the scene analysis of 126 on the blackboard, but she had no clue. [Ren Changxia] then turned and left the meeting room, as the camera slowly pushed in on the blackboard.
1:20:38|1:20:51|Soon after, the scene shifts to [Ren Changxia], who is holding a blanket and tidying it up. After a while, she suddenly stops, tapping the blanket with her fingers, then looks up thoughtfully and walks to the side to take out her phone.
1:20:52|1:20:54|The phone rang, and [Ren Changxia] slowly answered.
1:21:54|1:22:7|Captain Qiu finished speaking and looked at [Ren Changxia]. [Ren Changxia] glanced at him, said nothing, then turned around and walked forward slowly. After taking a few steps, he stopped slowly, sighed, and then spoke slowly.
1:22:46|1:23:6|[Ren Changxia] shed tears as she spoke. Captain Qiu, standing beside her, looked around and then lowered his head without saying a word. In the silence of the forest, some children's laughter could be heard.
1:23:42|1:23:50|The scene then fades out, and when it lights up again, the text at the bottom of the screen indicates that the time has come to April 14th, 2004.
1:24:9|1:24:31|Accompanied by the sound of attacks and distant bells, a withered tree appears and then gradually fades from the screen. The scene then shifts to a meeting room, where [Ren Changxia] is sitting at a table, deep in thought. Shortly after, she picks up a pen and starts writing intently.
1:24:31|1:24:36|As the camera continues to push in, we see the words "My Self-Criticism" written on the paper in front of [Ren Changxia].
1:24:39|1:24:49|Later, [Ren Changxia] sat at the table, massaging her temples with both hands, then tilted her head, leaned on her arm, closed her eyes to relax, and let out a slow yawn.
1:24:49|1:25:5|After a while, [Ren Changxia] opened her eyes and picked up the phone on the table to take a look. Then she turned around, put her coat on the chair, stood up and shook her neck. She also stretched out her arms, did some chest expansion exercises while looking out the window. After finishing the exercises, she walked to the door, opened it, and took a deep breath.
1:25:6|1:25:19|Later, she walked to the washstand, put her hands in the basin to wash, picked up the towel on the rack, then looked up at herself in the mirror. She reached out to touch the wrinkles beside her eyes, and then applied lipstick in front of the mirror.
1:25:31|1:25:48|The scene shifts, and a car is seen speeding down the road. Before long, the car stops in front of the Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau, and [Ren Changxia] gets out and strides towards the police station. The scene then shifts again, showing [Zheng Gang] sitting in the office, flipping through papers.
1:25:48|1:25:54|Then the camera slowly moves, gradually revealing the face of [Ren Changxia].
1:27:41|1:27:51|[Ren Changxia] finished speaking, smiled at [Zheng Gang], then turned and left the office, walked out of the Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau, and then she sat in the car.
1:27:53|1:27:59|The scene then cuts to a residential area, where a car drives in and slowly stops by the side of the road.
1:28:3|1:28:19|In the square of the residential area, the voice of [Ren Changxia] could be heard. At this moment, Mao Mao was running around kicking a ball in the square. [Ren Changxia] pushed [Liu Liangeng] while watching Mao Mao from behind. Mao Mao then ran to [Ren Changxia], and the three of them continued walking forward. Inside the car, [Captain Qiu] watched the three of them and slowly closed the car window.
1:28:19|1:28:28|The car then drove away, and soon it reached the highway, slowly stopping behind the car in front. [Ren Changxia] in the car then looked up.
1:28:38|1:28:44|Afterwards, he opened the car door, got out of the car, then closed the door and took a few steps forward.
1:28:51|1:29:3|He took a few steps, then stopped again. At this moment, a gentle breeze blew, gently moving his hair. [Ren Changxia] stood still, adjusted his tie, and then walked away briskly, while the cars on the road remained motionless.
1:29:3|1:29:9|The scene changes, vast fields of rapeseed flowers come into view, with a figure slowly walking in the distance.
1:29:10|1:29:25|The woman walked while touching the rapeseed flowers beside her with her hand. As the camera moved, the face of [Ren Changxia] appeared in front of her. She had a cheerful expression on her face and gradually stopped walking, then lowered her head in contemplation for a while before raising it again, memories of the past flashing through her mind.
1:29:25|1:29:35|The scene fades in, revealing a winding path. In the distance, a person riding a bicycle approaches. As the camera moves closer, the person's face becomes clearer, it is [Niu Dong].
1:29:36|1:29:52|He pedaled the bicycle with effort, with a thermos in the front basket. While riding, he occasionally touched the thermos in the basket. Soon, he rode onto a road next to a construction site, with a bulldozer slowly approaching in the distance.
1:29:53|1:29:59|At the moment when the two cars were getting closer and closer and then met, [Niu Dong] fell to the ground with both the person and the car.
1:29:59|1:30:14|He slowly got up from the ground, looked around, then turned his head to look behind. After that, he struggled to stand up, ran to pick up the thermos on the ground behind him, wiped the thermos with his hand and held it in his arms, then turned around and walked to the back to lift up the car.
1:30:46|1:30:59|Happy New Year, happy New Year. After saying that, [Ren Changxia] walked to Zhou with the documents and sat down. Then, she lowered her head to look at the documents in her hands. The scene shifted, and with the sound of firecrackers, fireworks were also being set off in the sky, creating a lively atmosphere.
1:32:26|1:32:48|After speaking, Maomao lowered his head and slowly took out a thermos from his clothes. He then lifted the thermos slowly and looked at [Ren Changxia]. Ren Changxia immediately opened the lid of the thermos, saw the steaming dumplings inside, then lowered her head to slowly put down the lid. She then raised her head, tears welling up in her eyes as she looked at Maomao.
1:32:50|1:32:55|Ren Changxia choked back tears as she gazed at Mao Mao, her eyes filled with tenderness.
1:32:59|1:33:11|[Ren Changxia] hugged Maomao tightly and tears streamed down her face. After Maomao finished speaking, she also started crying.
1:33:15|1:33:27|[Ren Changxia] kept talking while constantly patting Maomao's head. Maomao had long been crying on her shoulder, unable to calm down for a long time. The scene shifted, and numerous fireworks flew into the sky, then bloomed.
1:33:27|1:33:36|Underneath the fireworks, a huge lantern formed by numerous small lanterns is seen. As the camera slowly moves, groups of people appear beneath the giant lantern.
1:33:37|1:33:56|Some of them dressed up as dragons and ran back and forth, while others sat on the side playing drums and gongs. The atmosphere was lively, with everyone's faces beaming with smiles. At this moment, the figure of Captain Qiu appeared in the scene, seen banging the drums and looking at the people around with a smile on his face. He was surrounded by many villagers and police officers from the police station.
1:33:57|1:34:11|Then, the martial arts team also appeared around, with [Ren Changxia] wearing a floral wreath. In the scene, she was seen constantly moving her body to the rhythm of the music, smiling at the crowd, while next to the amazing martial artists, the fuzzy face of Mao Mao slowly appeared.
1:34:12|1:34:29|At this moment, Uncle Ding in the crowd waved a fan, constantly twisting his body as he walked back and forth. The lady next to [Ren Changxia] also smiled and started dancing. Following the animals continuously, the dragon and lion dance teams around still shuttled back and forth, winning applause from many onlookers.
1:34:29|1:34:41|The lively gathering brought the festive atmosphere to a climax, as well as the joy. At this moment, whether it was Captain Qiu or the villagers, smiles were on their faces, and their hearts were all praying for blessings in the coming year.
1:34:42|1:34:57|The scene then fades, gradually revealing vast fields of rapeseed flowers. [Ren Changxia] is seen walking briskly in the sea of flowers, with a smile on her face, gazing ahead towards the flowers. The scene then slowly fades away, with the distant sunset casting its glow on the road.
1:35:34|1:35:54|The words were not finished, the police officers in the meeting room stood up and froze in place. Then the scene changed, and when the lights came on again, a group of nurses were seen carrying a covered stretcher. Behind the nurses were police officers in uniform, holding their hats in their arms, following the nurses slowly forward with unified steps and determined eyes.
1:35:54|1:36:12|The group kept moving forward. Then, the scene gradually faded away, and a police car driving on the road appeared on the screen. As the camera moved, we saw behind the police car, a long line of vehicles following, with cars flashing their lights continuously, forming a tight and endless convoy.
1:36:12|1:36:27|They drove along the highway, slowly descended a steep slope, and then quickly traveled on the city streets. At this moment, a photo gradually appeared on the screen. As the light on the photo faded, a picture of the Ren family appeared on the screen.
1:36:28|1:36:45|The photo is a family portrait taken in a photo studio before his death. In the portrait, they are all smiling with joy. Then, many wreaths appear in the picture. As the camera moves, a police officer's figure appears next to the wreaths. He then turns and walks away.
1:36:45|1:37:3|The scene then cuts to a hall filled with wreaths and offerings, where many police officers are busy arranging flowers. Everyone is busy placing their flowers in the right spot, with [Captain Qiu] bustling around. The camera then shifts to Chen Ju slowly placing a bouquet of flowers down, followed by a wreath appearing in the frame.
1:37:3|1:37:22|As the camera continues to move, the words "Rest in Peace" on the wreath gradually become visible. In front of the wreath, a police officer is adjusting the words on it. Then he slowly lifts his head, and this person is [Liu Liangeng]. He is seen with tears in his eyes, turning his head to the side, and then the picture of the memorial photo of [Ren Changxia] in the hall appears.
1:37:22|1:37:26|[Liu Liangeng] looked at the photos on the wall, then lowered his head and burst into tears.
1:40:16|1:40:36|The following scene gradually fades, as the camera slowly moves up, [Niu Dong] gradually appears in the frame. He sits alone in a wheelchair with a scarf, staring blankly into the distance. Then the scene shifts, only to see [Liu Liangeng] slowly walking into the frame, and then he stops by a tree, looking into the distance.
1:40:36|1:40:41|After watching for a while, he walked quickly to [Niu Dong]'s side and bent down to speak to him.
1:41:22|1:41:41|After listening to the heavy situation, a look of worry filled Ren Changxia's face. Then she slowly lifted her head and looked into the distance. In the center of the frame, Ren Changxia's smiling face appeared, her eyes and eyebrows curved in a very charming smile. In the scene, her smiling face and figure alternated back and forth, with her steps light and cheerful as she continuously walked into this sea of flowers.
1:41:42|1:42:0|The camera then pushes forward, with [Ren Changxia] standing in front of the sea of flowers, her eyes determined, smiling as she looks ahead. She then slowly raises her hand with effort, and the scene gradually fades away, leaving only the silhouette of a person in the distant sea of flowers, still moving slowly.
