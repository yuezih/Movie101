0:1:1|0:1:8|Their father, under the drizzle, tightly grasped the handle of the cart, walking with the children on the way into the city, passing through the lush countryside lanes.
0:1:8|0:1:19|The father and his two children arrived in the bustling town. They stopped at a crossroads, and the father turned around, picking up the two children from the cart one by one. The children stood at the crossroads holding umbrellas.
0:1:22|0:1:39|Two children without their father's supervision stood at the intersection, looking a bit bored. They muttered to each other for a while, then ran off to play with umbrellas. After a while, their father returned with a cart, looking around, but the two children were already gone from the intersection. He anxiously asked the vendors on the side of the road.
0:1:49|0:2:4|The father, who was at a loss after getting no answers, turned the cart around and went back the way they came to search. Meanwhile, the two children were holding hands and strolling through the market. They spotted a small stall selling chili peppers by the roadside and walked up to it to inquire.
0:2:13|0:2:26|Upon hearing the vendor's words, the child imitated him and shook the chili seeds in his hand. The two decided to split up, with [Zhao Gang] staying at the chili stall and [Mu Lei] going back to find his father. On the other side, the father returned to the intersection and suddenly saw [Xiao Feng's Mom] running towards him.
0:2:36|0:2:48|The father, sweating profusely, followed [Xiao Feng's Mom] and ran forward. Just as they ran out of the alley, they collided head-on with a truck. The driver, upon hitting someone, quickly got out of the car to check the situation.
0:2:59|0:3:18|On the other side, [Zhao Gang] stood in front of the chili stand with his head down. He listened to the vendor's words, looked at the chili seeds in his hand without saying a word, and then clenched his fist. Meanwhile, the father who had been in a car accident remained unconscious and was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment, with the situation looking grim.
0:3:18|0:3:20|At the same time, the vendor looked at [Zhao Gang] and asked,
0:4:5|0:4:11|[Zhao Gang] at this moment, looked like a successful career person, took out sunglasses from his pocket and went upstairs.
0:4:39|0:4:54|[Zhao Gang] rubbed his head, waved his hand confidently and said, "You can trust me on this, my speed will be faster than you imagine." Hearing this, the bosses exchanged a silent glance and finally spoke, "Let's head to the picturesque place of [Mountain and Water Beauty] again."
0:5:12|0:5:29|In the past two years, he has been working hard and exploring the experience of ecological agriculture, from a clueless village official to someone who has figured out a whole set of ecological agriculture methods.
0:6:22|0:6:28|[Mu Lei] looked at the approaching [Xiao Feng] with a smile, welcoming her. He reached out his hand and said with a smile.
0:6:28|0:6:46|But he didn't notice that his hands were covered in chili powder, [Xiao Feng] also didn't notice. After shaking hands, she rubbed her eyes, getting chili powder in them. Her eyes couldn't open because of the spiciness, and she started crying from the irritation. It was only then that [Mu Lei] realized, lowered his head to look at his hands, and found them covered in chili powder.
0:6:53|0:7:10|The man beside him was still puzzled. Mu Lei realized what was happening, and Jin Wang ran to the side of the field, pulled out the grass, crushed it in his hand, and smeared Xiao Feng's face with it. On the other side, Zhao Gang's father held Xiao Feng's photo and spoke.
0:7:18|0:7:22|[Zhao Gang] took the photo with a smile, touched his head, and confidently said.
0:7:49|0:7:56|[Zhao Gang] finished speaking, put on his sunglasses, and left stylishly. On the other side, [Xiao Feng] went back home in tears.
0:9:9|0:9:25|Mu Lei didn't say a word, turned around and walked into the house, slamming the door shut. Mu Lei's girlfriend Lily watched his departing figure, breathing heavily with anger, and the two parted ways like this. On the other side, Zhao Gang swaggered out of the company gate wearing sunglasses, and opened the door of a car.
0:9:43|0:9:58|Shi Feng and Mu Lei drove to Tiemen Town, while on the other side, Mu Lei arrived at Xiao Feng's house. He stood at the door and knocked, Xiao Feng walked to the door, saw the visitor, widened her eyes, then closed the door and walked back.
0:9:58|0:10:3|Having finished the last bite of his meal, [Mu Lei] rubbed his head in frustration, recalling his experience with [Xiao Feng] at the bookstore.
0:10:19|0:10:26|Mu Lei quickly ran over to grab the book and started flipping through it when he heard this. Xiao Feng patted his shoulder and said:
0:10:34|0:10:58|[Xiao Feng] didn't even look up at [Mu Lei], and angrily turned and walked away. It was only then that [Mu Lei], who was immersed in his book, reacted and quickly caught up. The shop owner behind him saw him holding the book and also followed. At that moment, [Zhao Gang], who was sleeping in the car, happened to pass by.
0:10:58|0:11:1|Suddenly, driver San, who was busy watching the excitement, crashed into [Xiao Feng].
0:11:8|0:11:10|In the hospital, [Xiao Feng's Mom] came.
0:11:28|0:11:32|Mu Lei rummaged through his pockets and pulled out a few banknotes, saying to him.
0:11:50|0:11:52|Mu Lei left after stuffing the money in.
0:11:55|0:12:5|At this moment, [Mu Lei] is walking downstairs with a large package on his back. He takes out his phone and dials a number, putting it to his ear as he waits for the other person to answer.
0:12:22|0:12:32|Time goes back to now, [Xiao Feng] comes to the window on the second floor, quietly looks down at [Mu Lei], then sneakily brings out a large basin of water, and pours it down on [Mu Lei] below.
0:12:36|0:12:59|The scream of [Mu Lei], who was drenched in water, alerted [Xiao Feng]'s mother. The two reached an agreement and split up, with [Xiao Feng's Mom] going downstairs to take [Mu Lei] back home.
0:16:28|0:16:49|The old man handed the sickle to [San'er], while [Zhao Gang] stood not far away. The old man looked at a face that was exactly like [Mu Lei]'s. [Xiao Feng] and her companions arrived in the field, [Mu Lei] is indeed a reliable and capable young man.
0:17:7|0:17:9|[Zhao Gang] paced back and forth at home after returning.
0:17:46|0:17:52|However, it is said that their relationship was not particularly good when they were in the army.
0:18:23|0:18:28|[Zhao Gang] rubbed his head in frustration, while the person they referred to as [Xiao Feng] was troubled by blind dates.
0:18:42|0:18:57|[Xiao Feng] nodded, picked up the costume and checked it carefully. Suddenly, her eyes lit up as if she remembered something joyful, and she smiled satisfactorily at the costume. Before long, [Xiao Feng] swaggered into the restaurant wearing the oversized and unattractive costume.
0:19:0|0:19:14|In order to avoid being noticed by the other party, [Shi Xiaofeng] went to great lengths. When the waiter looked at him in surprise, he felt even happier. On the other side, [Zhao Gang], with a big beard stuck to his mouth, dressed strangely to avoid blind dates with [Shi Xiaofeng].
0:19:23|0:19:38|Xiao Feng opened the door, widened her eyes, and acted as if she had entered the Grand View Garden, laughing foolishly. She casually found a chair to sit down, deliberately wiped her nose with the oversized sleeve, then stretched her arms and yawned without any grace.
0:19:38|0:19:52|Looking at the image of Xiao Feng, [Zhao Gang] stood there in disbelief. [Zhao Gang] had never seen such a scene before, his eyes widened, unable to say a word. Xiao Feng, seeing this, acted even more vigorously, yawning and wiping his nose, pulling him in every way possible.
0:19:52|0:20:5|Xiao Feng rolled up her sleeves and started eating with her hands as if she hadn't eaten in 800 years. Zhao Gang, who had just come to his senses, also began his own performance. He picked up a big chicken leg and ate it greedily, not even noticing when his beard fell off.
0:20:22|0:20:27|After the blind date turmoil, [Zhao Gang] and [San'er] arrived at the building where Xiao Feng works, sitting in the car and peeking from inside.
0:22:29|0:22:32|The crowd dispersed unhappily, and Xiao Feng rubbed his head and replied:
0:22:46|0:22:53|Speak up, [Lily] arrived at the field, sure enough, [Molly] was here, she walked up to [Little Lei].
0:23:3|0:23:13|Mu Lei remained silent, and at this moment, Xiao Feng also walked over. Mu Lei stood up straight and looked at Xiao Feng who had walked through the fields to his side.
0:24:17|0:24:26|[Xiao Feng] knocked the water bowl out of [Mu Lei]'s hand, then turned around halfway. Upon hearing this, [Mu Lei] lowered his head and muttered a few words.
0:24:43|0:25:5|Lili stood there staring at him, then turned and walked away. Mu Lei didn't chase after her, quietly picked up the bowl on the ground, and continued working. Zhao Gang and Xiao Feng's father walked to the preparation area, with Xiao Feng's father examining the furnishings in the room.
0:26:34|0:26:37|Sun Li, a master with a frown on his face, asked.
0:28:27|0:28:29|On the other side, [Mu Lei] is still introducing the ecological field to people.
0:28:52|0:29:9|On the other side, [Shi Xiaofeng] dragged her heavy feet and walked into the house, looking exhausted. She collapsed on the sofa. [Xiao Feng's Mom] handed her a glass of water, looking at her tired daughter with a heart full of pain, unable to hold back her words.
0:29:27|0:29:38|Mu Lei, who was working, heard Xiao Feng's words, put down the basin in his hand and looked at Xiao Feng. He sighed heavily, then nodded with a worried expression on his face.
0:31:56|0:31:59|[Xiao Feng] was very excited and stumbled, [Mu Lei] quickly helped her.
0:32:8|0:32:22|Returning to the city, Lily bumped into [Zhao Gang], mistaking him for [Mu Lei]. [Zhao Gang] shrugged and walked away without paying much attention. Lily watched [Zhao Gang] walking away, puzzled. Meanwhile, [Xiao Feng] and [Mu Lei] walked out with smiles on their faces.
0:32:35|0:32:44|The scene shifts, with [San'er] peeking through the door crack, spying on [Mu Lei] and [Zhao Gang]. [Mu Lei] turns his head, sizing up [Zhao Gang] and says.
0:33:23|0:33:27|[Zhao Gang] rubbed his head and waved his big hand, saying.
0:33:58|0:34:1|[Zhao Gang] sneered and stood up, saying.
0:34:5|0:34:10|A talent like you, [Zhao Gang], pulls [Xiao Feng] up beside him.
0:34:22|0:34:35|[Xiao Feng] glanced at [Mu Lei], then left. In the private room, only Lily and [Mu Lei] were left. Lily looked puzzled and said, [Mu Lei] frowned, remained silent, just staring at [Zhao Gang]'s back, as if thinking about something.
0:34:35|0:34:47|Returning home in the evening, [Mu Lei] took out a photo from the wardrobe and stared at it blankly. He slowly turned to his mother, who looked at the teary-eyed [Mu Lei].
0:35:29|0:35:35|The mother took the photo from [Mu Lei]'s hand and gently wiped it with a cloth, both of them teared up for a moment.
0:35:53|0:36:8|[Mu Lei] choked up and finished speaking, blinked his moist eyes, then turned and left. His mother looked at the photo in her hand, missing him like a flood rushing in. Tears had already covered her face, she wiped away the tears from the corner of her eyes, unable to take her eyes off the person in the photo for a moment.
0:36:8|0:36:14|She turned around, reluctant to put her husband's memorial photo back into the wardrobe, then took out a small box from inside.
0:36:15|0:36:32|The mother stared at the box for a moment, then carefully placed it on the table. At that moment, she seemed to have aged ten years in an instant, hunching over to open [Mu Lei's Mom]'s box. Inside the box was also a photo, showing the family of four from years ago.
0:36:35|0:36:48|Early the next morning, [Li Li] arrived in front of a tall building. She looked up and saw that the building in front of her was the company of [Zhao Gang]'s father. [Li Li] went to [Zhao Gang]'s father's office and handed him a photo. [Zhao Gang]'s father looked at the photo, as if pondering something.
0:37:55|0:38:2|Zhao Gang's father looked at Li Li in confusion, then picked up the photo on the table and examined it carefully.
0:38:23|0:38:26|On the other side, [Zhao Gang] and [San'er] at home looked worried.
0:38:42|0:38:55|During the conversation, Shi Feng's father returned. He stood at the door for a moment, then walked towards Shi Feng with a serious expression on his face. The two looked at each other, both troubled by their own worries, so neither of them spoke.
0:38:55|0:39:2|In the end, [Zhao Gang]'s father walked upstairs with his hands behind his back, while [San'er] watched him go upstairs and continued the previous conversation.
0:39:6|0:39:23|[San'er] hesitated for a moment, saluted, took exaggerated steps and walked out. The scene shifted to the village, where Lily was chatting with [Mu Lei's Mom].
0:40:3|0:40:5|Mu Lei's Mom paused for a moment upon hearing this, then smiled and did not respond.
0:40:28|0:40:47|Shi Feng carried the dumplings back into the house. Lili also stood up, dusted off the flour on her hands, and followed inside. Then she brought out a basin of water from the house and walked towards the front door. At that moment, Mu Lei was walking towards home with a book in his hand, and he bumped into Lili who was pouring water out of the door. Mu Lei asked Lili in confusion.
0:41:6|0:41:20|Watching [Mu Lei] and [Xiao Feng], Li Li felt jealous, she picked up the basin in her hand and poured it all over [Mu Lei], then put the basin on his head, and walked home angrily. Seeing this, [Xiao Feng's Mom] burst into laughter.
0:41:20|0:41:35|[Mu Lei] took the basin down, with a piece of green vegetable still hanging on his head, smiling foolishly. At the dining table, Li Li stared at [Mu Lei] intently. Xiao Feng looked angrily at Li Li, while [Mu Lei] remained silent. [Mu Lei's Mom] witnessed the scene and quickly intervened to defuse the situation.
0:41:37|0:41:58|[Lily] picked up a dumpling for [Mu Lei], intending to give it to Xiao Feng, but then passed it to [Mu Lei's Mom]. [Mu Lei] picked up a dumpling and handed it to Xiao Feng. Seeing this, [Mu Lei's Mom] then picked up a dumpling for [Lily]. The dumpling battle ended, and Xiao Feng and [Mu Lei] walked on the road.
0:42:33|0:42:44|A speeding car came to a stop in front of them. The door opened, and Xiao Feng gasped as she looked at the person getting out. [Zhao Gang] closed the door and walked up to the two of them.
0:43:35|0:43:39|Xiao Feng looked at Mu Lei, who was talking confidently, with admiration on her face. Mu Lei continued speaking.
0:44:12|0:44:18|After Zhao Gang finished speaking, he pulled Xiao Feng over. Xiao Feng glanced at Mu Lei and followed Zhao Gang. Mu Lei quickly shouted.
0:44:21|0:44:39|Mu Lei watched the two of them get into the car with longing eyes. The car started quickly, leaving Mu Lei standing there in a daze, looking at the departing figures with a face full of sadness but also helplessness. The car drove into the city, and Zhao Gang parked the car by the roadside. Xiao Feng got out of the car, followed closely by Zhao Gang.
0:45:38|0:45:52|On the other side, Mu Lei rubbed his hands and walked home with a heavy heart. He didn't notice a Land Rover parked on the side of the road, with someone inside watching him - it was Zhao Gang's father. The scene then switched to Xiao Feng and Zhao Gang.
0:46:21|0:46:27|[Zhao Gang] looked at the contract, nodded silently, and said.
0:47:55|0:48:10|[Zhao Gang]'s father took out a photo from his bag and handed it to [Mu Lei's Mom]. She took the photo and was stunned at first glance. In the photo was a family of three, with a face that looked exactly like [Mu Lei]. She trembled with excitement as she looked at it.
0:48:10|0:48:21|She looked at [Zhao Gang]'s father with a photo in her hand, opened her mouth as if to speak but hesitated. She carefully examined the photo, tears streaming down her face in excitement, trembling hands delicately touching the picture.
0:48:21|0:48:39|Excited, [Zhao Gang]'s father stood up and walked into the room. Seeing the woman in tears of joy, he felt a sense of doubt in his heart. He fanned the fan in his hand, as if trying to erase his worries. Soon after, [Mu Lei's Mom] came out with a box containing a family photo of the four of them.
0:48:41|0:49:0|He took out a photo, carefully wiped it, and handed it to [Zhao Gang]'s father. [Zhao Gang]'s father quickly put down the fan, smilingly took the photo, looked at it, and also froze in place. He put the two photos together, compared them, and slowly furrowed his brow. Muttering to himself.
0:49:6|0:49:9|He spoke and handed two photos to [Mu Lei's Mom].
0:49:27|0:49:31|Hearing this, [Mu Lei's Mom] knelt down in front of him.
0:49:41|0:49:56|He quickly helped up [Mu Lei's Mom], the woman sitting on the stool holding a photo, as if holding her long-lost child, looking at the photo over and over again, never getting enough of it, as if trying to make up for decades of longing.
0:49:56|0:50:1|Zhao Gang's father also fanned for him, looking at this scene, eventually also lost his eyes.
0:50:10|0:50:28|Unaware of what was happening, [Zhao Gang] arrived at the village. He walked around suspiciously in sunglasses, looking around nervously, afraid of being discovered. When he reached the gate, he stood still and peeked inside quietly. Suddenly, a hand slapped him hard, startling [Zhao Gang], who looked back nervously.
0:50:37|0:50:42|Xiao Feng happened to pass by, watching the two fighting, pouting and walking away.
0:51:30|0:51:49|Mu Lei's Mom, upon hearing this, pushed Lily away and hurriedly walked outside. Seeing this, Lily also ran after her. Mu Lei's Mom walked along the road to the outskirts of the village, looking around anxiously, but fate did not comply with her wishes, and she still did not see her long-lost son.
0:51:49|0:51:51|On the other side, [Mu Lei] arrived at Xiao Feng's house.
0:52:28|0:52:30|Mu Lei smiled faintly and said nothing.
0:52:37|0:52:40|Hearing this, Xiao Feng's parents exchanged a glance.
0:53:12|0:53:19|Xiao Feng's parents looked at the two who came in and out together, feeling a bit puzzled for a moment. [Xiao Feng's Mom] asked in confusion.
0:53:27|0:53:30|Late at night, [Mu Lei's Mom] and [Uncle Chen] sat together.
0:53:56|0:54:25|After listening to Uncle Chen's analysis, Mu Lei's Mom looked at the photo borrowed from Uncle Chen in silence, not saying a word for a long time, and finally sighed. The scene shifted, and Zhao Gang returned home. Upon hearing this, Zhao Gang's father was stunned. He hesitated for a moment, put down the newspaper in his hand, and turned to look at Zhao Gang.
0:54:48|0:54:55|Hearing this, [Zhao Gang] became afraid, not daring to know the truth. He turned his head to go upstairs, but stopped halfway. [Zhao Gang] sat slanted on the sofa, looking at his father. His father put down the newspaper in his hand and patted his shoulder.
0:55:54|0:56:5|[Zhao Gang] waved his hand to leave, but as he stood up, a roar from his father made him stop in his tracks. His father walked up behind [Zhao Gang], looking at his back, and slowly began to speak.
0:56:23|0:56:30|Upon hearing these words, [Zhao Gang] was stunned for a moment, then stormed out of the house with a look of sorrow and indignation. Angry, [Zhao Gang] found [San Er].
0:57:24|0:57:33|Mu Lei heard the news and quickly walked towards [Uncle Lao Chen]'s house. In the courtyard, [Mu Lei] was shelling peanuts while looking at [Uncle Lao Chen] sitting across from him.
0:58:34|0:58:36|"Speak up," [Mu Lei] said angrily as he walked towards the door, and then locked the door of [Uncle Lao Chen]'s house.
1:0:25|1:0:29|Upon hearing this, [Zhao Gang] was momentarily speechless, pursed his lips, and said nothing.
1:0:59|1:1:2|On the other side, Mu Lei's Mom is anxiously waiting.
1:1:22|1:1:27|Mu Lei's Mom sat nervously in a chair, while Xiao Feng's Mom brought out several pots from the house.
1:2:56|1:3:6|[Xiao Feng] pushed [Mu Lei's Mom], who then snapped out of her daze. Meanwhile, [Xiao Feng's Father] arrived at [Zhao Gang's Father]'s office.
1:3:54|1:4:6|After saying this, [Li Li] lowered her head. Zhao Gang's father was stunned upon hearing this, and he exchanged a glance with Shi Feng's father. Meanwhile, in the office, [Zhao Gang] sat there lost in thought.
1:4:16|1:4:27|Hearing this, [Zhao Gang] snapped out of it, looked at [San'er], remained silent for a moment, picked up the sunglasses on the table, then stood up, grabbed the bag and hat, and walked out quickly.
1:4:27|1:4:44|[San'er] saw [Zhao Gang] sighing and leaving the house, quickly walked to [Zhao Gang]'s computer room, wanting to know what was troubling him. To her surprise, [San'er] was dumbfounded to see a photo of Xiao Feng on [Zhao Gang]'s computer screen. Meanwhile, [Xinghua] was anxiously sitting in Xiao Feng's house.
1:5:8|1:5:13|Don't be fooled by their identical looks, one is in the sky and the other is underground.
1:6:4|1:6:12|After Xiaofeng finished speaking, he left angrily, leaving behind a helpless old father. The next moment, he arrived in the village with [Zhao Gang].
1:6:19|1:6:23|Suddenly, [Zhao Gang] reached out and held Xiao Feng's hand, but Xiao Feng quickly pulled away.
1:6:56|1:6:59|[Mu Lei] sat down and started stringing chili peppers with his mother.
1:7:38|1:7:45|Hearing his son's question, he froze for a moment, stopped his work, then smiled and said to [Mu Lei].
1:8:1|1:8:18|Speak up, [Mu Lei's Mom] thought of Zhao Gang's recent situation, as if letting go of her worries, she smiled, wiped away her tears, and continued with her work. But Mu Lei, who heard these words, felt uncomfortable in his heart. He turned his head without saying a word, slowly stopped his actions, and tears fell without him realizing.
1:8:19|1:8:27|He stood up and silently walked towards the room. When he reached the door, he hesitated and stopped, but in the end, he didn't say anything.
1:8:28|1:8:37|Mu Lei's Mom watched as Mu Lei walked into the room, then took out a box from beside the sofa and carefully examined the photo given to him by Zhao Gang's father.
1:8:37|1:8:47|Back in the room, Mu Lei opened the drawer, took out a small hat, and held it in his hand, looking at it quietly, lost in thought. Suddenly, his mother's voice interrupted his thoughts.
1:9:37|1:9:53|[Mu Lei] looked helplessly at [Mu Lei's Mom], his face full of grievances. He sighed heavily, then turned around and took out the small hat from the drawer, looking at the hat and said to [Mu Lei's Mom].
1:10:3|1:10:20|You... [Mu Lei] threw the hat into the drawer, turned stubbornly, tears already covering his face, but he did not back down on this matter. On the other side, [Zhao Gang] was sitting alone on the sofa, curled up, the sunlight shining on his face, suddenly making him sober.
1:10:20|1:10:40|He sat up, leaning back against the sofa, sitting cross-legged with his eyes tightly closed. Suddenly, as if he had remembered something, he opened his eyes wide, got up, and walked to the ecological field. He looked at the vast fields in front of him, feeling the sweet breeze of nature brushing his cheeks, and listening to the chirping of birds around him.
1:10:40|1:10:50|He stood there quietly, feeling everything, his heart experiencing an unparalleled tranquility at this moment. On the other side, [Xiao Feng's Mom] and [Mu Lei] were pacing anxiously at home.
1:11:30|1:11:34|[Xiao Feng's Mom] didn't listen to her father and ran out with [Mu Lei].
1:12:55|1:13:7|[Xiao Feng's Mom] closed the door and as soon as she entered the room, [Zhao Gang] immediately pressed his ear against the door. Meanwhile, [Xiao Feng's Mom] was also inside the room, listening to the commotion outside with her ear against the door. She walked over nervously, opened the door, and smiled at [Zhao Gang].
1:13:13|1:13:19|Seeing [Xiao Feng's Mom] smiling so sweetly at him, [Zhao Gang] burst into laughter and happily went to squeeze juice from fruits.
1:13:23|1:13:32|Meanwhile, in the room, [Xiao Feng's Mom] quietly approached [Zhao Gang]'s clothes rack while he was away, and started picking out his clothes.
1:13:32|1:13:45|She looked left and right, shook her head feeling unsatisfied, finally picked up a suit and looked at it carefully. She imagined the scene in her mind, smiled with satisfaction, then carefully took it off, hugged it gently.
1:13:54|1:14:4|Xiao Feng took the opportunity while the two were talking and slipped away with the stolen suit.
1:14:51|1:14:55|On the other side, [Zhao Gang] disguised himself as [Mu Lei] to meet with the investors.
1:15:17|1:15:21|Mu Lei, feeling uneasy, suddenly stood up and walked out.
1:15:26|1:15:33|He pushed open the door, walked out with big steps, wiping the sweat off his head, while [Zhao Gang] on the other side suddenly stood up.
1:15:37|1:15:45|[Zhao Gang] and [San'er] walked towards the door, while at that moment [Mu Lei] happened to pass by. Once again, the two brushed past each other, and the waiter at the door came over and said.
1:15:51|1:16:3|[Sanger] followed the waiter to move the car, leaving [Zhao Gang] alone at the door. He touched his head and walked towards the distance. At this moment, Lily and [Secretary Niu] came down from upstairs and walked to the office door. Lily spoke.
1:16:10|1:16:13|Lily was about to leave when she ran into [Mu Lei] coming towards her.
1:16:19|1:16:31|Mu Lei watched as Lily turned around and quickly slipped away. Lily turned back and saw Zhao Gang coming out of the restroom.
1:16:48|1:16:59|On the other side, [Mu Lei] accidentally walked into the room of the investor. He entered the room, paused for a moment, and then sat down. The eco-farm investor asked.
1:17:39|1:17:52|[Zhao Gang] had just finished speaking and then slipped away. He ran out the door and entered the room of the aluminum mine investor. At that moment, [Mu Lei] walked out of the room of the ecological field investor and stood at the door scratching his head in confusion.
1:17:55|1:18:0|The next moment, unaware [Mu Lei] was dragged in front of [Secretary Niu] by Lily.
1:18:42|1:18:45|And at this moment, [Zhao Gang] was sitting in the room of the aluminum ore investor.
1:19:12|1:19:29|After ending this inexplicable conversation, [Zhao Gang] rolled his eyes, sensing that something was amiss, and walked out of the room fidgeting. As he left, the suppliers looked at each other in confusion. Outside the door, [Zhao Gang] entered the room of the ecological field supplier.
1:19:46|1:20:0|[Mu Lei] shook off [Xiao Li]'s hand, took big strides forward, paused at the door of the aluminum mine investor's office, and then walked in. [Xiao Li] looked puzzled, while [Mu Lei] approached the developer and said seriously.
1:20:24|1:20:30|At this moment, the two groups of people gathered at the door. [Xiao Feng's Mom] and [Secretary Niu] hurried forward.
1:21:13|1:21:37|The aluminum ore investor, who stood speechless with his back turned, glanced at the crowd and left in anger. [Zhao Gang] watched the investor leave in a fluster, then pointed at [Mu Lei] and scolded him. Upon hearing Mu Lei's words, [Xiao Feng] smiled happily.
1:21:53|1:22:4|[Zhao Gang] furrowed his brow, straightened his suit, turned his head to the side, and remained silent for a long time. On the other side, [Shi Xiaofeng] returned home and was preparing food in the kitchen. Xiao Feng's mother walked in.
1:22:32|1:22:40|Xiao Feng, carrying the meal she made herself, arrived at the field, walking with a happy smile on her face. She approached [Mu Lei] and said.
1:23:20|1:23:34|When it was time to get married, Xiao Feng couldn't bear it after hearing those words, so she angrily left the lunchbox and walked away. In the city, Xiao Feng walked desolately on the road and happened to run into [Zhao Gang] who was just getting into a car.
1:23:34|1:23:40|Xiao Feng got into the car and sat in the passenger seat, then turned around and energetically called out to [Zhao Gang].
1:23:52|1:24:7|Thoughtful [Zhao Gang], after saying that, turned his head and sighed, no longer looking at him. Xiao Feng, seeing him silent, then opened the car door and got out, slamming the door hard. She didn't leave, just stood by the car window, staring at [Zhao Gang] with a sense of grievance.
1:24:7|1:24:11|No sooner had he closed the car door than [Zhao Gang] started the car and drove away.
1:24:14|1:24:19|On the other side, Mu Lei hurriedly arrived at the hospital, and Old Uncle Chen greeted him.
1:24:43|1:24:49|Before long, the [doctor] came out with the test report, and [Mu Lei] quickly approached to inquire.
1:24:55|1:25:3|Upon hearing this, [Mu Lei] was so anxious that he broke out in a cold sweat and walked out in a daze. Seeing [Uncle Chen] standing at the door, he spoke up.
1:25:13|1:25:24|Uncle Lao Chen looked [Mu Lei] up and down, carefully examining his face, then patted him and said.
1:25:24|1:25:43|[Mu Lei] finished speaking, [Old Uncle Chen] widened his eyes in shock. Inside the emergency room, [Zhao Gang] sat beside his mother, watching as the blood dripped into her body. Tears rolled down [Zhao Gang]'s cheeks like beads as he looked at his mother on the hospital bed. Lost in memories, he thought, "Twenty-seven years ago, when I first saw you."
1:26:16|1:26:30|[Zhao Gang] stopped and lowered his head. His father patted his shoulder, and neither of them spoke again. The scene shifted back to the present, with [Zhao Gang] and [Mu Lei] standing by their mother's bedside. Suddenly, the nurse beside them spoke up.
1:26:38|1:27:0|The mother looked at her two sons on both sides, showing a happy smile, trembling as she reached out her hand to touch the heads of the two sons. On the other side, [Xiao Feng's Mom] and her family sat on the sofa in silence, only to see [Xiao Feng] crying while grabbing food with her hands, stuffing it into her mouth as if she had been shocked by something.
1:27:0|1:27:3|Xinghua looked at her with a worried expression.
1:27:10|1:27:12|[Xiao Feng] started crying loudly.
1:27:33|1:27:36|One morning, [Zhao Gang]'s father came to the village, shouting from a distance.
1:28:29|1:28:49|[Zhao Gang] looked at [Xiao Feng]'s silent parents, and without hesitation, he picked up the chili and put it in his mouth. Watching [Mu Lei] grimacing from the spiciness, [Xiao Feng] widened his eyes and couldn't help but laugh. The scene then shifted to the park.
1:29:5|1:29:18|Lily, who was completely confused, was pulled by [Xiao Feng], chasing after the two brothers [Zhao Gang] and [Mu Lei] ahead. Up to this moment, the few of them turned hostility into friendship. The fierce battle they had, came to an end.
