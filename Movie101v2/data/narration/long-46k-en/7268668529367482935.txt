0:1:45|0:2:0|The camera focuses on a residential building and follows it inside to [Hao Liansheng]'s home. On the wall hangs a wedding photo of him and his wife Meimei, both smiling sweetly with faces full of happiness. It's still early, and the people in the photo are currently fast asleep.
0:2:24|0:2:44|But some potential troubles will unconsciously walk into your life. At 6:30, the alarm clock rang on time, [Hao Liansheng] groggily reached for the alarm clock, and sleepily turned off the alarm. He rolled over to find [Xiaomin]'s hand resting on his head, he pulled it over and gently kissed it before getting out of bed.
0:2:44|0:3:0|It's still early, but people in the city have already started to get busy. Some are picking vegetables at the morning market, some are rushing to work, and some are going to have breakfast. The streets are bustling. At this moment, [Hao Zheng], the son of [Hao Liansheng], walks through the street. He walks into Dezheng Street, wearing a police uniform, with a straight posture.
0:3:0|0:3:6|At home, [Hao Liansheng] is brushing his teeth and washing his face. He wipes off the toothpaste residue at the corner of his mouth with a towel, and takes a quick look at himself in the mirror.
0:3:34|0:3:39|[Hao Liansheng] came home and [Hao Zheng], who was shaving, walked out.
0:5:35|0:5:53|[Hao Liansheng] put on his suit, grabbed his briefcase, and was ready to go to work. As he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment. After speaking, he confidently headed to work, and at that moment, [Xiaomin] emerged from the bathroom.
0:6:3|0:6:6|At this moment, [Hao Liansheng] is getting off his bicycle.
0:6:51|0:7:10|[Hao Liansheng] had a look of discontent on his face as he kicked away the foot lamp, got into the car complaining, and disregarded his neighbor's words. With vehicles passing by on the street, he was the only one cycling in the bike lane. He pedaled happily without feeling strange about it, glanced at his watch, and increased his pace towards the company.
0:7:10|0:7:16|Before long, [Hao Liansheng] arrived at the office. He greeted the security guard while pushing his cart, and entered the building at exactly 7:55.
0:7:17|0:7:22|He entered the office with a friendly smile, greeted his colleagues, and they all responded in kind.
0:8:4|0:8:8|The crowd felt disappointed, with a hint of dissatisfaction on [Hao Liansheng]'s face.
0:8:26|0:8:29|At the board meeting, everyone had their own thoughts, with different expressions.
0:9:40|0:10:2|At this moment, the secretary [Huahua] walked into the meeting room and stood beside President Wang, catching the attention of Chairman Hao Liansheng instantly. President Wang, who was weak, struggled to stand up. Before he could finish speaking, he started coughing violently. [Huahua] quickly helped him sit down and handed him the medicine.
0:10:24|0:10:29|Today we nominated the candidate for general manager. It seems like everyone has a good idea in their hearts, as if Vice President Hao Zheng is the most likely candidate.
0:11:35|0:11:50|The TV starts playing, [Xiang Zhudan] looks like he's enjoying the show, while Mr. Wang lightly rubs his eyes, his face full of curiosity. In the scene, the well-proportioned [Huahua] is wearing a tight camisole dress, holding a file and looking for [Hao Liansheng] to sign, he deliberately gets close to [Hao Liansheng], but he deliberately avoids it.
0:11:50|0:12:9|But [Huahua] still lingered around him, and [Hao Liansheng] finally left as if escaping. Giving a relieved smile to [Zhu Dan], the chairman self-harmingly lowered his eyes to bribe, the TV screen cut to the office, [Huahua] wearing the same clothes here looking for documents.
0:12:9|0:12:13|Vice President Zhou got closer and closer to him, and finally pulled him into his arms.
0:12:18|0:12:26|Everyone shook their heads, even Vice President Zhou couldn't bear to watch and buried his head without saying a word. Chairman Dong was so angry that he snorted coldly.
0:12:38|0:12:56|One by one, everyone walked out of the meeting room, but Vice President Zhou remained seated, motionless. He rested his head on his hand, looking as lifeless as a deflated ball.
0:13:2|0:13:7|Vice President Zhou just shook his head repeatedly without saying a word. At this moment, [Hao Liansheng] is in the phone booth.
0:13:38|0:14:5|Speak up, [Hao Liansheng] turned and walked away, the colleague with long hair opened her hands, indicating extreme speechlessness. The two of them came to the cafeteria to eat together, and the colleague with long hair suddenly asked [Hao Liansheng], Hey, did you hear any unusual noises?
0:14:30|0:14:53|Abiao, who was fired by the company for harassing Ahjuan from the production department after drinking last time, has caused trouble again in less than half a year.
0:14:56|0:15:3|This guy was abandoned by his wife two years ago. Now he is all alone, no wonder he is fooling around.
0:15:36|0:15:38|[Huahua] walks towards [Hao Liansheng] at this moment.
0:16:13|0:16:19|The room was full of people all staring at [Huahua] in a trance, even after everyone had left, they still couldn't take their eyes off him.
0:16:33|0:16:41|[Hao Liansheng] has been waiting in the chairman's office for several hours. At this moment, [Liu Qingbiao] is in the office organizing everyone to prepare for the celebration ceremony.
0:17:24|0:17:30|After a few drinks, unable to handle the alcohol, [Hao Liansheng] slumped in his chair, when a voice rang in his head.
0:17:40|0:17:44|[Hao Liansheng] slowly opened his eyes and let out a sigh.
0:18:3|0:18:17|After the health aunt left, [Hao Liansheng] raised his hand to check the time. It was already late, so he quickly rubbed his face to wake himself up a bit, then took out a jewelry box from the drawer and examined the gold necklace inside. He gazed at the gold necklace, lost in memories.
0:18:17|0:18:25|Today is [Lin Manli]'s birthday. She just transferred here from Hong Kong a year ago to work.
0:18:33|0:18:42|[Hao Liansheng] hurried to the station, repeatedly checking the time to avoid being late. As soon as he saw the town exit, he quickly ran towards it. Despite being so nervous, an unexpected incident still occurred.
0:18:47|0:19:3|[Hao Liansheng] busied himself, only to realize he was looking in the wrong place. He hung up the phone in a hurry and headed to the correct destination. Just as he ran out, he found that he had forgotten to remove the SIM card from his phone, so he turned back. Finally, after much effort, he arrived at the location. Holding a photo of [Lin Manli], he looked around at the subway entrance, but couldn't find her after a long while.
0:19:3|0:19:11|At this moment, he saw a woman on the roadside slowly pulling a suitcase forward, so he quickly approached to inquire.
0:19:17|0:19:29|Hao Liansheng finally saw someone, but it wasn't Lin Manli. He stood there for a while, then sat on a nearby chair with a look of frustration on his face. He was worried that he wouldn't be able to complete the task and would let down Hao Zheng's trust in him.
0:19:29|0:19:37|Thinking of this, he took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and lit one, exhaling weakly, but his eyes kept scanning around, afraid of missing the real Lin Manli.
0:19:38|0:19:50|At this moment, a stylish woman dragging a suitcase stopped next to [Hao Liansheng]. She saw the photo on the table, smiled faintly, and asked [Hao Liansheng].
0:19:52|0:19:57|[Hao Liansheng] didn't pay attention at first, but suddenly stood up when he saw the woman's luggage.
0:20:7|0:20:17|[Hao Liansheng] was afraid of smoking [Lin Manli], hurriedly extinguished it, wanted to throw the cigarette butt but couldn't find a trash can, awkwardly laughed a few times, [Lin Manli] was amused by his appearance.
0:20:31|0:20:41|[Hao Liansheng] quickly packed up his bag, while [Lin Manli] waited quietly beside him. Suddenly, she saw... [Lin Manli] hurriedly pouring the muddy water into the bag.
0:20:52|0:21:7|After going through all the trouble, the two finally set off. They arrived at the main street, where various shops were brightly lit with signs, creating a lively atmosphere. [Hao Liansheng] took [Lin Manli] into a restaurant called Fulin Seafood, where his wife often worked.
0:21:53|0:21:59|Your company's [Xiang Zhudan] knows that he is honest and respects him, that's why he was entrusted with an important task.
0:22:42|0:22:45|After dinner, [Hao Liansheng] took [Lin Manli] to the furniture store.
0:23:13|0:23:16|Speak up, [Hao Liansheng] gets up from the bed and walks out angrily.
0:23:23|0:23:40|To avoid any misunderstanding, [Hao Liansheng] let [Lin Manli] shop by herself while he waited outside. Being very responsible, he was worried about the safety of a girl being alone at night, so he sat in a place very close to her where she could see him by just looking up. [Hao Liansheng] lit a cigarette.
0:23:40|0:23:49|Watching [Lin Manli] lost in thought while picking furniture in the store, at this moment, [Hao Zheng] and his colleague were on duty and happened to see [Hao Liansheng] passing by.
0:24:37|0:24:40|Oh, Hao Zheng hurriedly escapes.
0:24:48|0:25:15|[Hao Liansheng] walked towards his son, looking impatient. The flashback ended, but a smile still lingered on his face. [Hao Liansheng] put the necklace into a box and then closed the family photo on the table. He wanted to put the box in his pocket, but felt it was inappropriate. He took off his suit and draped it aside, standing up, lost in thought again.
0:25:17|0:25:31|The sun is sucking blood, the afterglow of the setting sun falls on the Pearl River, causing layers of ripples. Cars are speeding across the bridge, while below the bridge, a cruise ship is quietly sailing on the river, carrying tourists to enjoy the beautiful scenery. [Hao Liansheng] leaves the company and arrives at the cake shop.
0:27:32|0:27:47|[Meimei] hung up the phone, with a happy face, chuckled, and continued to immerse herself in work. Without his wife knowing, [Hao Liansheng] rode his bike to find [Lin Manli]. She lived in a beautifully decorated building, with convenient transportation downstairs, many supermarkets and restaurants, and a very good location.
0:27:47|0:28:1|[Hao Liansheng] quickly parked the car and took the cake from the back seat into the building. He looked nervous all the way, constantly looking around, afraid of being discovered. In the elevator lobby, [Hao Liansheng] was busy checking the surroundings, temporarily forgetting to look at the road.
0:28:1|0:28:9|Hao Liansheng hurriedly walked into the elevator without noticing someone coming out, and clumsily bumped into the person.
0:28:23|0:28:38|The woman stormed off in anger, but not without resentment. She glared at him before [Hao Liansheng] entered the elevator, closed his eyes, and began to daydream. In his imagination, he was impeccably dressed in a suit, holding a rose, and anxiously stepping into [Lin Manli]'s home after the elevator arrived.
0:28:38|0:28:48|The excitement made him feel like he was floating on cloud nine, walking in an S shape. And at this moment, [Lin Manli] was holding a bouquet of roses, dressed in a wedding gown, waiting for him with a smile on her face.
0:28:50|0:29:2|[Hao Liansheng] rushed in eagerly, seeing the ethereal [Lin Manli] standing still, her pupils dilating continuously, unable to hide her excitement. [Lin Manli] also embraced her, gently kissing her cheek.
0:29:26|0:29:42|The two embraced on a pile of grass, [Hao Liansheng] took [Lin Manli]'s hand and danced a graceful waltz. They danced from the park to the house, and back from the house to the park, entwined and reluctant to part. In their eyes, only each other's reflection remained, with happy smiles on their faces.
0:29:43|0:30:1|[Hao Liansheng] pulled [Lin Manli] in circles, the hem of the wedding dress swaying with the movements, as beautiful as a foreign doll of the octaves monk. She closed her eyes in ecstasy, lips slightly curled, perhaps out of guilt. Suddenly, the person in front of her changed from [Lin Manli] to [Meimei], wearing a suit with a crochet flower pinned to the chest.
0:30:1|0:30:14|Although not as young as Lin Manli, she has her own charm. Hao Liansheng, who was still immersed in it, did not notice immediately. After a while, he slowly opened his eyes, and as he saw the person in front of him clearly, his smile disappeared instantly, and he stopped five steps away.
0:30:14|0:30:21|[Hao Liansheng] suddenly woke up, shaking his head frantically, trying to shake off this disturbing scene. He blinked his eyes, still in shock.
0:30:40|0:30:52|The woman looked at him speechlessly as the elevator jumped up floor by floor. When they reached the 13th floor, [Hao Liansheng] came down with a gloomy expression. The woman was curious about where he lived and wanted to follow him up to take a look, but she was caught and had to retreat.
0:30:53|0:31:3|[Hao Liansheng] walked towards [Lin Manli]'s house in a daze, still immersed in the fear from earlier and unable to break free. At that moment, [Xiang Zhudan] rushed out of [Lin Manli]'s house as if fleeing for his life, looking extremely panicked.
0:31:6|0:31:16|[Zhu Dan] quickly rushed into the elevator and pressed a floor button. [Hao Liansheng] felt something was wrong and hurried to [Lin Manli]'s house.
0:31:20|0:31:43|Seeing no one answering, he walked to the bedroom. Not finding anyone there, he ran to other rooms to search. Still unsuccessful, [Hao Liansheng] placed the cake on the coffee table, but accidentally knocked over a glass of water. He trembled as he picked up the glass.
0:31:46|0:32:6|Only the kitchen was left to search. [Hao Liansheng] hurried to the kitchen and found [Lin Manli]'s kitchen knife lying at the door. [Hao Liansheng] stood up stiffly, frantically dialed 120, his fingers trembling slightly with anxiety. As he waited for the call to connect, his face was filled with worry.
0:32:34|0:32:47|[Hao Liansheng] put down the phone nervously and walked towards the door. When he reached the door, he thought about what would happen if he was discovered, hesitated for a moment, and turned back. He took out a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped the phone vigorously.
0:32:47|0:32:52|After wiping it, he put the phone down with a handkerchief, feeling a bit relieved, and prepared to leave.
0:32:55|0:33:7|He wiped it again, finished these, and then gently closed the door and left without helping [Lin Manli] who was lying on the ground. [Hao Liansheng] looked hurried, but his face was forced to be calm. He repeatedly pressed the elevator, hoping she would come up quickly.
0:33:7|0:33:15|But at this moment, the sound of police sirens blared. Hearing it, he became even more flustered, and after a moment of contemplation, he hurried towards the stairs, moving as fast as he could without daring to stop for a moment.
0:33:18|0:33:34|After walking several more levels, [Hao Liansheng]'s footsteps became disordered, and his speed was not as fast as before. He was running out of energy, leaning on the handrail, and forced himself to go down a few more levels. Finally, unable to hold on any longer, he sat directly on the steps. This series of changes left him mentally and physically exhausted.
0:33:34|0:33:40|At this moment, the couple walked to the stairwell to take out the trash, and became cautious when they heard the sound of police sirens outside.
0:34:1|0:34:13|Upon hearing these words, [Hao Liansheng] flashed through several scenes in his mind: [Lin Manli] wielding a knife in the kitchen, knocking over a water glass and cake on the coffee table, bumping into a woman in the elevator, and the scene of calling the police just now.
0:34:18|0:34:21|Each incident made [Hao Liansheng] break out in a cold sweat.
0:34:38|0:34:44|[Hao Liansheng] quickly got on the car and left the scene. He arrived at the main street, still pondering over the matter in his mind.
0:34:50|0:35:9|The neon lights flickered on, intertwining in a colorful display. In the memory, that night was at the Rolling Stone Nightclub, where the lights were bright and the music was deafening. A group of cool and handsome men and beautiful women danced wildly in the center of the dance floor to the strong beat of the music. On the stage, two sexy women danced passionately, lost in the music.
0:35:9|0:35:16|They are here releasing their stress and freely expressing their passion for life. At a nearby table, [Hao Liansheng] is having a gathering with colleagues.
0:35:17|0:35:40|They were surrounded by a group of beautiful women, one of them was cutting fruit with the women, another was toasting with a drink, while [Hao Liansheng] was staring straight at the dancing beauty, [Lin Manli] sat beside him peeling peanuts for him. On the other side, [Hao Zheng] was unexpectedly also here.
0:38:14|0:38:21|[Hao Liansheng] drank three glasses in a row with [Huahua]. [Huahua] fulfilled her promise to go on stage and sing, her sweet voice was very infectious.
0:38:42|0:38:50|[Lin Manli] pulled [Hao Liansheng] to the center of the stage, dancing along with [Huahua]'s singing. They stood face to face, very close to each other.
0:38:50|0:39:0|[Lin Manli] is very rhythmic, every move is on point, while [Hao Liansheng] is stiff all over, jumping without any method. On the side, [Liu Qingbiao] has a dazed look, staring blankly at them.
0:39:0|0:39:15|The singing gradually reached a climax, the men and women in the dance floor became more energetic, the atmosphere was very cheerful. [Liu Qingbiao] stared at [Huahua] with a playful smile, his eyes were like looking at prey, very greedy. He tilted his mouth, picked up the glass and drank it all in one gulp.
0:39:15|0:39:23|On the dance floor, as Pig Egg and Long-Haired Colleague danced happily, [Hao Liansheng] also entered a good state under the command of [Lin Manli]. However, soon he became exhausted and had to go rest.
0:39:40|0:39:47|[Lin Manli] helped him back to the seat, [Hao Liansheng] was exhausted and started panting heavily as soon as he sat down. [Hao Liansheng] wiped the sweat with a tissue.
0:39:58|0:40:7|Abiao put down his glass at this moment and staggered over. He leered and headed straight for [Lin Manli].
0:40:51|0:41:0|The long-haired colleague was pushed away by Hao Liansheng, and another person saw it and gave him a punch. Hao Liansheng was so angry that he rushed towards the long-haired colleague, and his sidekick also joined in the fight.
0:41:5|0:41:28|[Hao Liansheng] was anxiously trying to dissuade them. [Lin Manli] was also anxiously shouting loudly, but no one paid any attention to them, everyone just kept fighting. A colleague with long hair knocked a little follower down and made him sit on the ground, then picked up a pipe from the table and threw it at someone.
0:41:32|0:41:34|[Hao Liansheng] shuttles back and forth persuading.
0:41:34|0:41:51|But everyone fought even more vigorously, pushing each other aside in a hurry. [Zhu Dan] kept picking up cans and throwing them forward, while [Meimei] exchanged a few moves with another follower. The follower got hit in the eye, grabbed a bottle and smashed it towards the opponent, while [Liu Qingbiao]'s colleague fiercely punched the opponent's stomach. The cans on the table were all thrown out.
0:41:51|0:41:55|[Zhudan] actually lifted the cake and threw it out. [Lin Manli] once again blocked with her fists.
0:41:58|0:42:2|Everyone turned a deaf ear, as [Zhu Dan] smashed one small orange after another.
0:42:10|0:42:24|Everyone's eyes were red with anger. At this moment, someone landed a punch on [Hao Liansheng]'s face. [Hao Liansheng] fell straight to the ground, causing chaos in the venue as both men and women joined the brawl.
0:42:24|0:42:30|[Huahua] was laughing with his mouth wide open when suddenly, his sidekick picked up a cake from the ground and threw it at him, landing directly in his mouth.
0:42:35|0:42:51|Abiao returned and tried to lift up his follower who was pressed on the ground, but got his face smeared with cake. He picked up a bottle of wine on the side and chased after him, only to have the bottle smashed on the head of Hao Liansheng who had just struggled to stand up. Hao Liansheng was stunned, his eyes already unfocused. This farce finally ended with Hao Liansheng injured.
0:42:51|0:42:56|The next morning, he woke up in the hospital, with [Lin Manli] playing with flowers by his side.
0:44:23|0:44:26|[Lin Manli] suddenly stopped in her tracks, facing away from [Hao Liansheng].
0:44:34|0:44:38|After saying that, she walked out the door, leaving [Hao Liansheng] sitting on the bed pondering her words.
0:44:51|0:44:58|[Hao Liansheng] excitedly jumped out of bed, dancing with the flowers given by [Lin Manli]. At that moment, [Hao Zheng] and the others walked in.
0:45:2|0:45:19|[Hao Liansheng] saw that he was about to be exposed, so he sneakily took the vase from top to bottom, trying to pretend that he was using the vase for exercise. [Xiaomin] frowned in disgust, [Hao Liansheng] slowly turned around, put down the vase, and sat back on the bed. [Hao Zheng] and [Xiaomin] hurried forward, with [Xiaomin] even reaching out to touch his forehead.
0:45:38|0:45:44|[Hao Liansheng] slowly closed his eyes amidst the questioning of his children, walking out of this memory.
0:45:53|0:46:2|After making the decision, [Hao Liansheng] rushed home anxiously. At this moment, several police cars were parked downstairs in his building. Curious residents gathered around to see what was happening.
0:46:2|0:46:11|[Hao Liansheng] rushed home and was startled by the scene. He quickly parked the car, approached someone to inquire about the reason, with an expression of unease evident on his face.
0:46:25|0:46:35|[Hao Liansheng] walked to the side, stood on tiptoe and looked into the crowd. Suddenly, the image of Abiao flashed through his mind. When he was at [Lin Manli]'s house, he hurriedly ran out of the room, not even having time to close the door.
0:46:43|0:46:51|[Hao Liansheng] came to the conclusion and then turned to find Abiao. He went to Abiao's restaurant, ate while waiting for him. The TV in the restaurant was playing a news report.
0:47:17|0:47:25|The person in the news bears a striking resemblance to [Hao Liansheng], and the woman sitting next to him instinctively looks at him. [Hao Liansheng] feels uncomfortable under her gaze and stands up.
0:47:38|0:47:56|[Hao Liansheng] glanced at the woman, sighed, and the woman and her friend whispered to each other. [Hao Liansheng] was momentarily at a loss and lowered his head to think about what to do.
0:48:7|0:48:24|Hope was completely shattered, [Hao Liansheng] walked out of the restaurant in a daze. He walked alone on the street, the sky was already dark, with only him on the street. [Hao Liansheng] looked dejected, his back appearing very desolate. His face was twisted into a frown, showing a look of despair. His beautiful tie was now wrinkled and crooked on his collar.
0:49:1|0:49:16|[Hao Liansheng] once again immersed in memories. On the 28th, [Lin Manli] was working in the office as usual, holding a brochure in her hands, comparing it carefully. At the same time, [Hao Liansheng] walked into the office lobby with a smile on his face, hands behind his back.
0:49:52|0:49:58|Mary is in his studio, once he goes in, he won't eat or drink, and won't come out until the end of the workday.
0:49:59|0:50:9|[Hao Liansheng] took [Lin Manli]'s salary and walked towards his office. When he reached the door, he knocked on it.
0:50:11|0:50:14|[Lin Manli] dismisses the model and walks towards him happily.
0:50:26|0:50:32|[Hao Liansheng] followed [Lin Manli] into the office, where she handed him a paper cup and teased him.
0:50:39|0:50:47|The old man Shen Cai raised his hand and made an agreement. [Lin Manli] took the envelope and looked at it.
0:51:1|0:51:4|[Lin Manli] shook her head, her expression darkening.
0:51:5|0:51:18|[Lin Manli] finished speaking and walked away, leaving [Hao Liansheng] looking shocked, unsure of how to comfort her. After work, the two of them returned to [Lin Manli]'s home together. [Hao Liansheng] sat on the sofa while [Lin Manli] poured tea for him.
0:52:47|0:52:51|[Hao Liansheng] picked up the bag and walked quickly towards the door, but then stopped at the doorway.
0:53:5|0:53:26|[Hao Liansheng] wanted to say something, but held back. He nodded with a smile, opened the door, and walked out. Soon it was New Year's Eve, [Hao Liansheng] smoked a cigarette, sat alone on the sofa watching the Lotus Gala. At this moment, the phone rang, and he impatiently got up and moved to the phone, not forgetting to bring the ashtray along.
0:53:41|0:53:46|Leaning back, [Hao Liansheng] took a deep drag of his cigarette. But before long, the phone rang again.
0:53:54|0:54:0|Hey, hey. He hung up the phone again, took a puff of his cigarette, then thought of something and picked up the phone again to press the dial button.
0:54:58|0:55:13|[Hao Liansheng] hung up the phone, took a deep drag on his cigarette. He looked at the clock on the wall, it was almost midnight, the first day of the new year, destined to be spent alone. The ashtray on the table was full of cigarette butts, with only two cigarettes left in the pack.
0:55:13|0:55:31|The room was eerily quiet, with only a few lights on to indicate that there were people in the house. [Hao Liansheng] was restless at home, sometimes sitting on the sofa, sometimes getting up to pace. He was constantly thinking about someone, and just as he was about to sit down, the doorbell rang. Hao Liansheng quickly put out his cigarette and hurried to the door to open it.
0:57:13|0:57:22|Lin Manli slowly stood up from the sofa upon hearing the words, leaning against [Hao Liansheng]. Dressed in a bright short skirt, she looked like a withered rose at the moment, which was truly heart-wrenching.
0:57:38|0:57:53|As the new year approached with the countdown, on the live TV broadcast, various places had turned into a sea of joy at this moment, as people celebrated the arrival of the new year. The tipsy Lin Manli was overcome by drowsiness at this moment, her head slowly leaning towards Hao Liansheng, and she fell asleep drowsily on his shoulder.
1:0:19|1:0:27|[Hao Liansheng] sighed deeply, leaning against the public telephone with a sense of loss. At this moment, he especially missed the simple days of the past.
1:0:35|1:0:40|Hao Liansheng still didn't dare to go find [Meimei], and walked out of the door with a worried look on his face.
1:1:3|1:1:30|Hao Liansheng, who was wandering aimlessly on the street, was attracted by laughter. He panicked and forgot that it was his daughter. He hurriedly hid behind a stone table, feeling flustered. The hooligan was not convinced, raised his hand to hit Xiaomin, but was instead thrown to the ground by Xiaomin with a shoulder throw.
1:1:36|1:1:45|The last person who was not convinced was also knocked down by her, Hao Liansheng smiled contentedly on the side. Seeing Xiaomin's appearance, memories were brought back to several years ago.
1:6:19|1:6:36|Thinking back, he used to be the idol of his daughter and her friends. Reflecting on his actions during this time, [Hao Liansheng] felt ashamed of himself. He continued to walk down the street with a face full of regret, looking lifeless and wise. His appearance caught the attention of two passersby, who whispered to each other.
1:6:43|1:6:57|Hao Liansheng was completely unaware, still immersed in fear and sadness. He walked dejectedly, not knowing what he was thinking. His eyes gradually moistened, tears filling his eyes. He stopped, wiped away the tears, and made a decision.
1:7:1|1:7:6|He walked quickly forward, passing by a dessert shop, when suddenly several [doctors] rushed towards him.
1:7:21|1:7:37|Seeing [Hao Liansheng] struggling, the [doctor] injected him with a sedative. The liquid gradually entered his body, and [Hao Liansheng] calmed down, falling into a deep sleep. In his dream, he once again arrived at [Lin Manli]'s home. After the elevator reached the 13th floor, [Hao Liansheng] looked spirited as he took off his mask.
1:7:37|1:7:50|He straightened his suit, tidied his hair, with a spring in his step and a proud smile on his face. He bounced towards [Lin Manli]'s house, light on his feet, even dancing happily. When [Hao Liansheng] arrived at the door, he found it wide open.
1:7:51|1:8:10|[Ah Biao] was seen chasing [Lin Manli] with a knife. He pushed her down on the sofa. Seeing this, [Hao Liansheng] shouted and hurried forward to snatch the knife to stop him, but was pushed back onto the sofa by Ah Biao and unable to move.
1:8:12|1:8:25|Abiao intended to stab her, but suddenly stopped and turned to stab [Lin Manli] behind him. With nowhere to escape, [Lin Manli] was stabbed in the stomach. The two looked at each other, [Lin Manli] weakened and sat on the ground.
1:8:25|1:8:30|After A Biao hesitated for a moment, he quickly ran away. [Hao Liansheng] saw her leave and struggled to get up to save [Lin Manli].
1:8:37|1:8:49|[Hao Liansheng] picked up the knife from the ground and examined it in his hand. At that moment, [Xiaomin] suddenly appeared at the door. [Hao Liansheng] stood still, not knowing what to say to explain, and the knife slipped from her hand.
1:8:58|1:9:2|[Hao Liansheng] woke up from a dream and staggered out of the ward.
1:9:36|1:9:47|At this moment, [Xiaomin] is at home, feeling restless. She paces back and forth in the living room, touching her ear nervously, unable to sit still. She keeps glancing at the phone, hoping for good news to bring her peace of mind.
1:10:42|1:10:45|At this moment, [Hao Liansheng] is still walking on the road.
1:10:51|1:11:10|[Hao Liansheng] stopped in his tracks, rolled up his sleeves to check the time. It was already 3 am. He let out a heavy sigh and was about to continue walking when a police car came towards him. [Hao Liansheng] panicked and quickly hid behind the car, not daring to move. After the police car drove away, he cautiously came out, breathing heavily.
1:11:12|1:11:19|[Hao Liansheng] hesitated for a moment, not sure which way to go, and finally decided to go left without hesitation.
1:11:29|1:11:48|[Hao Liansheng] took a few more steps forward and found that the buildings in the neighborhood looked blurry, each one resembling Ah Biao's home, but upon closer inspection, they were not. [Hao Liansheng] looked around uncertainly and couldn't make up his mind, so he had no choice but to continue walking forward.
1:11:54|1:12:15|A figure flashed past [Hao Liansheng], who looked around vigilantly. [Hao Liansheng] was hit on the head by a brick thrown by Abiao and fell to the ground.
1:12:45|1:12:49|The mother and daughter excitedly plan, while [Hao Liansheng] gets up and continues to wander the streets.
1:13:28|1:13:37|[Hao Liansheng] stood at the bridge looking at the rushing river, scenes of his arrest involuntarily flashing through his mind. With heavy shackles on his feet, he walked forward, preparing to face interrogation.
1:14:59|1:15:16|The scene in the fantasy is too terrifying. [Hao Liansheng] feels as if his heart has turned to ashes. He slowly raises his head and looks towards the brightly lit Pearl River Bridge not far away. In the moonlight, he stands out like a splendid lone tree. The Pearl River flows quietly under the bridge, with shimmering waves on the surface. However, such a beautiful night scene may never be seen by [Hao Liansheng] again in the future.
1:15:16|1:15:23|Thinking of this, he withdrew his gaze desolately and continued on his way. In the police station, [Hao Zheng] was interrogating.
1:15:31|1:15:48|Abiao didn't expect that [Hao Zheng] would be so polite. He took the cigarette from him with a look of disbelief and [Hao Zheng] leaned in to help him light it. Abiao took a deep breath and hesitantly asked.
1:15:48|1:15:56|Upon hearing this, [Liu Qingbiao] was overwhelmed with joy and tears. He let out a long sigh of relief, his tense heart finally settling down. Then, he explained with a face full of embarrassment.
1:16:57|1:17:11|The truth of the matter was revealed, but at this moment, [Hao Liansheng] was still unaware. He walked aimlessly on the Pearl River Bridge, finally leaning despondently on the railing. Lighting another cigarette, the flame illuminated his face, tears glistening in his eyes.
1:17:11|1:17:21|[Hao Liansheng] regrets deeply, but it's too late. He looks despairingly at the flowing river beneath his feet, various tragic outcomes have left him physically and mentally exhausted. At this moment, a terrifying thought crosses his mind.
1:18:46|1:18:49|Not long ago, I watched a foreign film called "Beauty Without Guilt".
1:19:13|1:19:24|These words pierced [Hao Liansheng]'s heart like needles, unable to live and unable to die, he despaired and hid by the bridge. At this moment, his eyes were vacant, not knowing where to go or what to do in the future.
1:19:28|1:19:30|Lost in thought, [Hao Liansheng] was interrupted by a police officer walking over.
1:19:42|1:19:54|[Hao Liansheng] woke up as if from a dream, he turned to look at the police, tears streaming down his face. [Hao Liansheng] turned and walked away.
1:20:1|1:20:8|[Hao Liansheng] walked into the police station like a walking corpse, covered in dust with his hair sticking out in all directions like a rooster's comb.
1:21:24|1:21:37|[Hao Liansheng] heard this and was slightly stunned, then smiled. The tension that had been building up all night finally relaxed, and he sat down on the chair, feeling a bit embarrassed as he spoke.
1:21:37|1:21:45|[Hao Liansheng] wiped away the tears that had fallen, his face filled with the gratitude of surviving a disaster. After a night of twists and turns, he finally returned home.
1:22:8|1:22:24|After speaking, [Hao Liansheng] glanced guiltily at his wife, then collapsed on the sofa. [Meimei] walked over with a smile, holding a bowl, and helped him up. Holding the bowl, [Meimei] fed [Hao Liansheng] one bite at a time.
1:22:39|1:22:41|[Hao Liansheng] happily enjoys the care of his wife.
1:22:47|1:23:7|[Hao Liansheng] felt embarrassed to speak. He opened his mouth wide, waiting for his wife to feed him, his eyes dodging, secretly observing her reaction. He took out the necklace that was originally intended for [Lin Manli] from his pocket and handed it to [Xiaomin].
1:24:19|1:24:26|Tan Xiaojuan, [Hao Liansheng]’s phone rang, and she didn't react immediately.
1:24:56|1:25:12|[Hao Liansheng] stared in astonishment, unable to speak. But this time, he no longer had those fanciful ideas, instead he continued to live a simple but content life with [Meimei]. At this moment, he was riding a bicycle with [Meimei] by the riverbank.
1:25:12|1:25:21|[Lin Manli] has fully recovered. She is hiding in the studio again, still looking like a strong woman. In the end, everyone has found their own happiness.
