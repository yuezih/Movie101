0:2:49|0:3:2|The boss glanced at the copper coins in Bai Ling's hand, then turned to look at the children sitting around in a circle, their pitiful big eyes also staring at him. The boss sighed, took the copper coins and left, while Bai Ling sat down on the stool with a embarrassed expression.
0:3:35|0:3:43|The other children all looked back curiously, while [Bai Ling] turned her head in confusion, only to see a big man with a full beard lying on the table snoring loudly.
0:4:16|0:4:33|A bandit with a goatee slowly approaches the big man who is still asleep. He walks up quickly, pats the big man on the back with the back of his knife, and shouts. But the big man lying there still doesn't move. The angry bandit with a goatee squeezes out two words with force. The big man, who is sleeping with drool all over the table, still shows no reaction.
0:5:2|0:5:18|After speaking, the big man punched the man with a goatee in the face twice, with the final heavy blow hitting his temple and knocking him to the ground. The man with a goatee whimpered in fear, then the big man picked him up and started throwing punches relentlessly, each one more forceful than the last, before finally tossing him towards a nearby wooden table.
0:5:28|0:5:36|The big man stopped hitting until he was exhausted, and the other bandits watched him without daring to move.
0:5:37|0:5:53|At this moment, the man with the moustache on the ground already had a swollen nose and a bruised face, with blood and saliva mixing at the corners of his mouth. Seeing this, the other bandits swallowed nervously. The bandit closest to him drew his knife and swung it towards the big man, who slightly leaned to let the blade pass by his back. Then, he seized the hand holding the knife and blocked the attack from the other side.
0:5:55|0:6:2|[Bai Ling] instructed the children to crouch in the corner. Then, she looked up at the big man and saw him use his elbow to strike the leader of the robbers.
0:6:3|0:6:16|He then reversed the hand holding the knife behind his back, and smoothly twisted the attacker to kneel in front of him. Unexpectedly, another fearless knife-wielding assailant rushed forward. The big man calmly dodged three strikes, then grabbed the robber's arm and threw him straight onto the table.
0:6:16|0:6:28|He reached out and grabbed the man's leg, spinning him around and effortlessly throwing him out of the wall. The man could be heard wailing in the air, then landing heavily in the grass, leaving the other two people angrily shouting and rushing forward.
0:6:28|0:6:42|The big man grabbed one person with each hand, and in the blink of an eye, he twisted and crossed the hands of the two men holding knives. The two men, who had no resistance at all, were sat down on a bench by the big man, with their arms tightly held by him. Then he forcefully slapped one of them on the buttocks.
0:6:46|0:6:52|The children hiding nearby saw this scene and exclaimed in amazement. The big man, upon seeing this, pointed at the bandit's butt and gestured to the children.
0:6:58|0:7:5|The big man grabbed their arms and leaped backwards, pulling the two down to the ground. Then he searched their pockets and found a silver dollar, saying.
0:7:7|0:7:13|The boss hiding by the stove caught the thrown silver dollar, while the big man walked over, put on his hat, and prepared to leave with his luggage.
0:7:20|0:7:26|He took out a few copper coins from his purse and threw them over. The coins landed perfectly in the dough, lined up in a row.
0:7:40|0:7:49|[Bai Ling] hadn't had time to explain yet, the big man walked out the door, he turned over and jumped onto the horse, then took out a cloth to cover his eyes, skillfully tying a knot behind his head.
0:7:49|0:8:7|The figure of the big man was getting farther and farther away from the inn. The children rushed out of the inn and stood at the door, looking at the big man's departing figure. [Bai Ling] was also standing behind, holding two young children. The children's eyes were full of admiration, unwilling to move their gaze away.
0:8:10|0:8:25|The little girl's words made other children burst into laughter. The boy called Mantou, with half a noodle in his mouth, nodded. [Bai Ling] stared at the figure on the horseback, lost in thought. At this moment, the big man with his eyes covered shouted at the steed beneath him, galloping forward.
0:8:41|0:8:56|The soldiers on horseback with guns surrounded the civilians, while a flag with a dragon embroidered on it fluttered in the sky. At this moment, the imprint of a brush swept down, covering the flag, and the bold and powerful calligraphy of the movie title "City of Danger" gradually emerged.
0:8:56|0:9:7|Crossing over the towering mountain, a small town appears at the foot of the distant mountains, with clear river water flowing past nearby houses towards the distance. Houses are scattered on both sides of the riverbank, this is Pucheng.
0:9:7|0:9:22|The street was bustling with people coming and going, each household busy with their own affairs. The signboard of Pucheng hung at the city gate, adding a touch of solemnity to the small town. At that moment, the sound of approaching horse hooves could be heard, as a man rode in on horseback.
0:9:24|0:9:40|[Yang Kenan] walked into the courtyard with his hands full. His wife inside the house couldn't hide her excitement upon hearing the news of her husband's return.
0:9:57|0:10:5|The henchmen looked at each other in confusion after listening, while the curly-haired man on the side said.
0:10:48|0:10:54|Seeing the refugees kneeling down one after another, [Yang Kenan] couldn't bear it in his heart. He turned around and looked at the people around him, and said.
0:11:20|0:11:26|The people around frowned in silence, while the man with glasses shouted at the crowd.
0:11:39|0:11:48|[Yang Kenan] looked at everyone, with a relieved smile on his face. The man with glasses suddenly shouted at a distance.
0:12:20|0:12:37|After [Bai Ling] explained the ins and outs of the matter to everyone, [Yang Kenan]'s wife comforted him. When she finished speaking, [Bai Ling] looked at her gratefully and responded softly.
0:12:47|0:12:58|Suddenly, a restless noise came from outside, and [Yang Kenan] immediately stood up. His men beside him immediately went out. At this moment, a group of people on horseback brazenly broke into Pucheng through the city gate.
0:12:58|0:13:14|The roadside stall, which was not cleaned up in time, was knocked into the air, with various foods scattered all over the ground. The group of people continued to charge forward without stopping. They rode all the way to the door of [Yang Kenan]. The leader, with slicked-back hair and open shirt, looked around before dismounting, followed by the others.
0:14:0|0:14:11|Suddenly, his fist came rushing forward, [Yang Kenan] calmly blocked the fast punch and flipped backwards. Seizing the opportunity while the opponent was rolling, he leaped up and kicked the person to the ground.
0:14:18|0:14:34|The henchmen picked up their weapons and approached menacingly. [Yang Kenan] turned and walked away, cracking the whip from his waist backwards. Then, he quickly pulled [Wang Weihu] who was charging from the other side into the whip. In the midst of the chaos, a voice shouted out.
0:15:23|0:15:29|The sound of a horse neighing from behind caught everyone's attention, and they all turned to look behind them.
0:15:29|0:15:42|A horse carrying a person wearing a bamboo hat slowly approached the crowd. Everyone made way for them. The horse stopped in the middle, but the person sitting on it showed no reaction. Children could vaguely see the person's face.
0:15:47|0:16:3|The man riding the horse turned out to be the big man who helped out at the inn with a knife, but at this moment he was still in a dreamland, completely unaware of the gaze of the crowd. At this moment, the figure on the horse gradually slanted and fell straight to the ground. The children around laughed and the blindfolded big man, in pain, rolled over and shouted.
0:16:5|0:16:12|He pulled down the cloth strip over his eyes, looked at [Ma Feng] beside him, and said.
0:16:21|0:16:29|[Yang Kenan] looked at [Mrs. Liu] with confusion, and [Mrs. Liu] patted the boss's shoulder and said.
0:16:44|0:16:59|The children who were shouting suddenly fell silent, looking at the Sun Wukong in front of them with some fear. The big man suddenly started to grin and make faces, imitating Sun Wukong scratching his ears and cheeks. The children then burst into laughter again. The big man helplessly turned around and picked up the reins on the side.
0:16:59|0:17:4|[Yang Kenan] looked at this scene and smiled, while the big man looked at him and pulled on the reins.
0:17:5|0:17:22|At this moment, [Yang Kenan] put away his smile, his brows furrowed as he silently observed the movements of the big man. The big man looked around and then sat on a chair, waiting. Snoring could be heard again in the room. Suddenly, a figure walked into the shop, picked up a barber's license from the wall, and covered the sleeping big man with it.
0:17:22|0:17:36|He then walked to the table, picked up the scissors, and when he saw a larger pair of scissors next to him, he decisively put down the one in his hand and picked up the other one to hit the big man. The big man, who was half asleep, looked at [Yang Kenan] in confusion.
0:17:54|0:18:2|He picked it up himself and talked while picking it up.
0:19:17|0:19:23|Yang Kenan stopped the scissors in his hand and blew on them.
0:19:48|0:20:4|Upon hearing the ambiguous response from [Yang Kenan], [Ma Feng], feeling uneasy, immediately sat up from his chair. He recalled the strange experiences of the day and then picked up the mirror beside him, slowly moving it in front of his eyes. Looking at his neatly trimmed beard, he exclaimed in amazement and began to admire his handsome face.
0:20:4|0:20:17|[Ma Feng] held up the mirror, raised his chin, raised an eyebrow, and then smirked. He glanced at the door and then back at the mirror. After that, he touched his beard and was reluctant to put down the mirror.
0:20:17|0:20:27|Night falls, the moonlight is blocked by dark clouds, and the cicadas' chirping sounds particularly loud in the quiet small town. At this moment, [Ma Feng] is lying on a wooden table, sound asleep.
0:20:27|0:20:34|[Bai Ling] looked at the sleeping [Ma Feng] from a distance, her steps towards him becoming hesitant. After a while, she gathered her courage and walked up to [Ma Feng].
0:20:34|0:20:53|The expression on her face became very conflicted. Then, she hesitantly called out. But at this moment, [Ma Feng] showed no signs of waking up, and started snoring gradually. [Bai Ling] had to walk a few steps closer, bend down, and raise her voice to call out. This startled [Ma Feng], who sat up abruptly.
0:21:47|0:22:0|After speaking, he immediately lay down again, turned his body around, and faced away from [Bai Ling]. But [Bai Ling] still stood in place, not leaving. For the safety of the children, she couldn't care about so much anymore. Then she took another step closer and spoke again.
0:22:32|0:22:40|[Bai Ling] shook her head helplessly and said nothing more. [Ma Feng] stood up to look at her, making a satisfied sound with his mouth.
0:22:42|0:22:49|[Bai Ling] looked up at [Ma Feng] and found him staring at her with a serious expression.
0:22:54|0:23:4|[Bai Ling] slipped away from his arm while talking, and [Ma Feng] leaned against the pillar and smiled triumphantly. Startled and heart racing, [Bai Ling] turned her head and said.
0:23:13|0:23:29|After speaking, [Ma Feng] kept looking at [Bai Ling] across from him. He saw her blinking her bright eyes, smiling at him, and then she left without saying anything. Watching [Bai Ling] walking away, [Ma Feng]'s gaze gradually softened, but his heart was filled with mixed emotions.
0:23:29|0:23:41|At this moment, [Yang Kenan] sat on the bed, looking at the child sleeping in his arms. His wife walked over with a painting and sat down beside him. She glanced at the child and softly asked.
0:23:54|0:24:5|The wife pointed to the self-portrait of the child and couldn't help but laugh. The child in her arms frowned as if about to be awakened. The wife immediately gestured for him to lower his voice. [Yang Kenan] suppressed his laughter, but his body couldn't help but tremble.
0:24:5|0:24:22|The wife gave him a reproachful look and gently patted his back. Then she leaned over gently, pressing her face against her daughter's head. At this moment, [Yang Kenan] held his wife's hand, gripping it tighter. The small room was enveloped in the happiness of the family of three, the light inside the house continued to shine, while the night outside grew darker.
0:24:22|0:24:36|In the early hours of the morning, Pu City gradually emerged in the darkness, with only the river flowing into the distance clearly visible. The sky was covered with dark clouds, and thick fog almost covered the entire mountain. The sound of horses seemed to break the tranquility, coming from an unknown direction.
0:24:36|0:24:51|A man dressed in white robes, riding a horse, leisurely approaches the city gate. As he walks in, he looks around. A wooden board on the door is lifted from the inside, and Zhou Susu comes out carrying a bundle on her back, urging someone to hurry up.
0:24:56|0:25:4|The children walked out one by one with their belongings. At this moment, the man had already ridden his horse to the streets of the town.
0:25:10|0:25:25|The children quickly placed their luggage and went inside to eat noodles. A stranger man calmly observed his surroundings. The cousin who was still organizing the luggage behind the carriage heard the sound and glanced outside, then he walked up to the man and greeted him with a smile.
0:25:35|0:25:48|The man on horseback, wearing sunglasses, looked around and then turned his head to gaze at the shopkeeper in front of him with a smile that was not quite a smile. He did not speak, just nodded slightly. Then, the hospitable Brother Liao invited the man inside.
0:25:50|0:25:57|A man walked into the house past the children eating noodles. Upstairs, [Bai Ling] who was writing, heard the frantic barking of a little dog.
0:26:55|0:27:4|The man turned his head and looked back, with a cold smile on his face. After [Bai Ling] saw his face clearly, a terrible scene flashed in her mind.
0:27:25|0:27:40|After his cousin left, the man turned to look at [Bai Ling], who was standing far behind. [Bai Ling] frowned as she looked at [Cao Shaolin], breathing heavily, tears almost welling up in her eyes, then replied...
0:27:41|0:27:53|[Cao Shaolin] spoke while placing his hand on the head of the boy who was still asleep on the side, and with his other hand he lifted the teapot and poured it into the cup. [Bai Ling] looked pale, she slowly walked to [Cao Shaolin]'s side, then lowered her head and pleaded softly.
0:28:4|0:28:14|After speaking, he stared at [Bai Ling] waiting for an answer. [Bai Ling] looked up, glanced at the child sleeping next to [Cao Shaolin], and then shook her head silently. Then, she started to sob helplessly.
0:28:44|0:28:48|[Bai Ling] had tears on her face, shaking her head continuously. Her lips trembled, but she insisted on speaking.
0:29:20|0:29:26|Upon hearing this, [Bai Ling] looked at him with red eyes, only to see [Cao Shaolin] turn his head and say to his cousin who was making noodles outside.
0:29:27|0:29:44|At this moment, the cousin outside is fishing noodles from the pot, completely unaware of the danger inside the house. [Cao Shaolin] is patting the boy's head while smiling at the outside. [Bai Ling] looks at the cousin outside with tears in her eyes without saying a word. He leans towards [Bai Ling]'s face.
0:29:50|0:30:7|Outside the house, [Bai Ling] watched as her cousin stirred the noodles in the pot with chopsticks, feeling anxious but helpless. As her cousin walked in with the noodles, smiling, she was so scared that she could hardly breathe, gasping for air with her mouth wide open. However, her cousin didn't notice anything unusual and cheerfully greeted her as he walked in.
0:30:9|0:30:25|[Cao Shaolin] looked down at the noodles on the table, only to see the smile on his face gradually disappear. He dared to get closer and look, but there was no beef noodles with scallions. Seeing this, [Bai Ling] on the side finally let out a sigh of relief. She looked up and saw [Cao Shaolin] in disbelief.
0:30:25|0:30:33|The other person glared at her angrily, then looked down at the bowl, and let out a sinister laugh.
0:30:36|0:30:50|Cousin Zhang, who was shot, turned around with his mouth open, and [Yang Kenan] inside the house heard the gunshot and walked outside. [Yang Kenan]'s men rushed out, and at this moment, Cousin Zhang, who was shot three times in a row, fell directly to the ground, with blood flowing from the corner of his mouth to the back of his head.
0:30:50|0:31:3|The boy sleeping on the table heard a noise, groggily got up, and [Bai Ling] looked at her cousin lying on the ground, staring with wide eyes unable to speak. She glared fiercely at [Cao Shaolin], who was still laughing, then rushed over and shouted.
0:31:15|0:31:27|Gunshots rang out again quickly, [Bai Ling] turned around and saw the heavily wounded Da Yuan lying on the ground. She screamed in despair, tears streaming down her face, then she shouted at [Cao Shaolin].
0:31:35|0:31:45|[Cao Shaolin] smiled and shoved the gun into [Bai Ling]'s mouth, pulled the trigger, blood dripping from [Bai Ling]'s mouth as she fell to the floor by the table, the gun already out of bullets. However, [Cao Shaolin] kept pulling the trigger relentlessly.
0:31:45|0:31:52|At this moment, [Yang Kenan] kicked down the wooden board and rushed into the room with his men. Everyone was shocked to see the body on the ground.
0:31:53|0:32:2|At this moment, the flustered [Cao Shaolin] lowered the gun in his hand and then immediately placed it on the table. A group of people surrounded [Cao Shaolin], while his henchmen took the gun from the table and moved it to a distance.
0:32:2|0:32:9|[Yang Kenan] walked towards [Cao Shaolin] while looking at the bodies on the ground. His men squatted down and placed their fingers in front of the large round nose.
0:32:9|0:32:22|Yang Kenan's wife looked at the bullet hole behind Bai Ling's head, then everyone turned their angry eyes towards Cao Shaolin involuntarily. At this moment, Yang Kenan stepped forward towards Cao Shaolin, who, however, put on an innocent look.
0:32:22|0:32:28|He looked around in horror, slowly backing away, staring at the furious [Yang Kenan] in front of him.
0:32:41|0:32:57|The children that [Yang Kenan] saved were sitting on the steps crying. His men were comforting them. [Ma Feng], who didn't know what had happened, frowned at the scene in front of him, then turned to look in the direction where the people were rushing. At this moment, angry roars kept coming from [Yang Kenan]'s courtyard.
0:33:4|0:33:11|The people are now crowded in the courtyard, raising their fists and vehemently denouncing the murderer in front of them. [Cao Shaolin], who is kneeling on the ground, looks somewhat bewildered as he gazes at the angry expressions of everyone.
0:33:13|0:33:22|In the crowd, a woman angrily rushes up the steps, ready to hit someone. Her henchmen quickly step in to stop her, while two strangers on horseback at the city gate see the chaos in Pucheng and immediately turn and ride out of the city.
0:33:51|0:33:57|[Ma Feng] watches the bodies of [Bai Ling] and others in the next room, then turns to look at [Yang Kenan] standing up.
0:34:24|0:34:30|There were dissenting voices, and [Ma Feng] glanced at the person.
0:34:39|0:34:47|After Yang Kenan finished speaking, he stared into Cao Shaolin's eyes and then walked to the front.
0:35:12|0:35:35|[Cao Shaolin] was lifted up from the ground by two henchmen, suddenly, a pair of hands violently pushed away the person squeezed behind. The woman was slapped to the side, and the crowd in front of her quickly made way, only to see a man in black standing in the middle, with a somewhat domineering attitude. Seeing this unexpected guest, [Yang Kenan] also became cautious. At this moment, [Ma Feng] in the distance saw the change in the expression of the man in black immediately.
0:35:35|0:35:41|At this moment, the man in black walked forward without changing his expression, and [Yang Kenan]'s two subordinates immediately ran over to intercept.
0:35:48|0:35:53|[Yang Kenan] turned to look at [Cao Shaolin], who was being held down by someone. The man in black took a step forward, but was stopped.
0:35:54|0:36:6|The man in black swung his sleeves and pushed the two in front of him aside. His henchmen immediately stepped forward to fight with him, but the man in black's punches and palms were as fast as lightning. After a few rounds, the henchmen quickly couldn't keep up, and one of them was a female henchman.
0:36:6|0:36:21|Seeing the situation, [Ma Feng] rushed forward and unexpectedly grabbed the waistband of the person, effortlessly lifting and spinning them around. The henchmen preparing to attack on the side were all knocked aside. Another defiant henchman rushed forward, but the man in black quickly twisted his arm tightly under his armpit in just a few moves, causing him to kneel down and speak.
0:36:27|0:36:42|Shortly after, a group of soldiers with long spears entered the room. The people inside the courtyard were surrounded. Upon seeing this, [Boss Liu] immediately stood up in fear. The man in black released [Yang Kenan]'s henchmen and stood up to speak.
0:36:47|0:36:52|The people in the courtyard began to discuss in whispers, their expressions becoming tense. [Ma Feng] furrowed his brow, observing the situation inside.
0:37:40|0:37:48|[Zhang Wu] looked at the young marshal in confusion, then [Cao Shaolin] spoke.
0:37:49|0:38:5|After speaking, tearful [Cao Shaolin] gave him a signal, [Zhang Wu] hesitated for a moment, lowered his head and said. Then he looked up at the pitiful young master at the moment, then turned to [Yang Kenan] and said. [Yang Kenan] looked back at [Zhang Wu] defiantly.
0:38:5|0:38:12|The hand on the neck was still not released. [Zhang Wu] turned around and said to everyone.
0:38:23|0:38:36|Standing behind [Brother Liao], hearing these words, rolled his eyes and almost fainted, and the person next to him immediately supported him. The people below all looked uneasy, [Yang Kenan] looked around with a grim face, still not letting go, pinching the neck of [Cao Shaolin].
0:38:36|0:38:47|[Ma Feng] leaned against the pillar, with his hands crossed over his chest, looking at [Zhang Wu] with an extremely indifferent expression. [Zhang Wu] also noticed the sorrowful gaze, and when he turned to see [Ma Feng], a hint of surprise appeared in his eyes.
0:38:47|0:39:6|But he quickly regained his indifferent look, and finally walked out of the courtyard without looking back. [Ma Feng] looked pensive, watching [Zhang Wu] walk away. Then he turned his head to look worriedly at [Yang Kenan] inside. At this moment, [Cao Shaolin] had already turned red from being choked. Captain Yang watched the person with the gun leave before letting go.
0:39:16|0:39:23|Captain Yang finished speaking and pushed hard. [Cao Shaolin] showed a look of extreme grief, watching the murderous demon acting so arrogantly in front of everyone, filling Captain Yang's heart with anger. At this moment,
0:39:25|0:39:31|The people below gathered around waiting for Captain Yang's solution. [Boss Liu] stepped forward and said.
0:39:58|0:40:5|Boss Liu turned around and walked out, with someone supporting him as he left.
0:40:7|0:40:12|Captain Yang, with anger in his eyes after hearing the provocative words, addressed the people in the courtyard.
0:40:18|0:40:34|But the people of Pucheng still stood in place with worried expressions. At this moment, Colonel [Zhang] rode back to the camp of the Cao army with the crowd. At the entrance of the large camp, there were rows of soldiers on guard. After [Zhang] entered the gate, he immediately dismounted and walked towards the tent. Two of his men caught up and said, "..."
0:40:47|0:40:53|He turned his head and continued to speak to them. The two remained silent, and [Major Zhang] continued speaking.
0:41:22|0:41:32|After speaking, the two of them looked angrily into the distance. One of them rolled his eyes and then smirked at his partner beside him. In the city of Pucheng, [Ma Feng] was placing his neatly packed luggage on the horse.
0:41:32|0:41:40|As he tidied up, he looked around the small town with a touch of life. When he turned his head, he saw Yang Kenan's wife standing in front of him.
0:41:44|0:41:51|After speaking, [Ma Feng] turned his head to continue organizing other things. [Yang Kenan]'s wife didn't say anything more, she walked straight to [Ma Feng]'s side and handed him what she was holding.
0:42:0|0:42:11|[Ma Feng] looked at her in confusion, then glanced down at the letter in her hand. He reached out and took the letter, but did not open it. He silently looked at the neatly folded letter. [Yang Kenan]'s wife spoke up.
0:42:14|0:42:30|After speaking, she nodded to [Ma Feng], turned around and left. Perplexed, [Ma Feng] looked at her retreating figure, recalling what she had just said. Then, he lowered his head to look at the letter in his hand, hesitating to open it. At noon, he went to a deserted place to open the letter.
0:43:13|0:43:26|At this moment, [Ma Feng] sat alone on a small hill made of wine barrels, holding a letter from [Bai Ling] in his hand, his eyes gazing into the distance. It turns out that what she was most concerned about in her heart was still her student. Unfortunately, this letter should have been handed to him by [Bai Ling] herself.
0:43:27|0:43:43|Before long, thunder rumbled and rain poured from the sky. At that moment, [Yang Kenan] was sitting in a porridge shop drinking tea, and he turned to see [Ma Feng] feeding a horse across the street. Sensing the gaze, [Ma Feng] also looked over, and the two of them stared at each other from a distance for a while. Then, [Yang Kenan] raised his eyebrows at [Ma Feng].
0:43:43|0:43:50|[Ma Feng] smiled and looked at him as he walked over, then the two sat down facing each other and started talking.
0:43:59|0:44:13|He blocked the wine glass, then raised the tea cup and said. They both raised their hands in a gesture, then each tilted their heads back and drank. [Ma Feng] put down the wine glass and said. [Yang Kenan] smiled and looked at him. [Ma Feng] lowered his head, looked at the wine glass, and continued to ask.
0:44:29|0:44:36|After speaking, [Yang Kenan] looked firmly at [Ma Feng] across from him. [Ma Feng], who was chewing something, avoided his gaze and looked into the distance. Then he spoke.
0:45:4|0:45:18|After speaking, [Yang Kenan] picked up the tea cup and drank it all in one gulp. [Ma Feng] looked at him with a hint of respect in his eyes. Then, he filled the cup again and drank heartily. Later, [Ma Feng] arrived at [Yang Kenan]'s house, where the children of Shitoucheng were sitting around the table eating noodles.
0:45:18|0:45:25|Yang Kenan's wife looked at them with concern in her eyes, Ma Feng looked at these young faces and said to Yang Kenan.
0:45:30|0:45:37|Seeing the puzzled look in [Yang Kenan]'s eyes, [Ma Feng] didn't know how to explain. He sighed and said.
0:45:46|0:45:52|After Ma Feng left, Yang Kenan, who had realized something, raised his eyebrows at his wife, as if waiting for her answer.
0:46:2|0:46:14|At this moment, Yang Kenan's henchman Guangzi arrived at the prison where Cao Shaolin was held to deliver water. Cao Shaolin sat inside with his eyes closed, silent. Guangzi looked at the untouched food, squatted down and shouted at him.
0:46:15|0:46:22|Cao Shaolin opened his eyes after hearing it, revealing a fierce look, Bai Ling glanced at him, put down the water, and then picked up the food to prepare to leave.
0:46:29|0:46:36|[Ma Feng] completely ignored [Cao Shaolin]'s crazy talk and walked away. At this moment, a white shadow of a knife appeared, and a group of black-clothed people were moving quickly.
0:46:41|0:46:54|[Ma Feng] glanced back at him and walked out. At this time, a group of black-clothed men were lurking on the roof of [Yang Kenan]'s house. The newcomers were the two who did not obey [Zhang Wu]'s management, and this scene happened to be seen by [Ma Feng] who had just walked out.
0:46:55|0:47:6|Shortly after, he immediately threw the bowl and chopsticks in his hand to the side, picked up the long pole next to him and shouted. [Guangzai] rushed out with the long pole, only to find a dark figure suddenly appearing on the roof behind him.
0:47:6|0:47:15|The man somersaulted in the air, picked up the knife and chopped down heavily. Sensing the killing intent, Bai Ling picked up a long pole to block it, exchanged a few moves with the man, and the people beside saw the man was no match and flew down.
0:47:15|0:47:27|[Brother Guang] had no choice but to face two opponents alone. At this moment, the brothers in the room rushed out. Seeing this, the men in black scattered and engaged with them. Surrounded by several people, [Brother Guang] was trapped in the middle, with the men in black standing in front of him, asking.
0:47:30|0:47:37|The henchmen behind them, upon hearing this, became angry and swung their knives to attack. [Guangzai] struggled to cope and was stabbed from both the front and back at the same time.
0:47:38|0:47:53|At this moment, [Bai Ling], with his body pierced, spits out blood and is kicked out by someone. His brother beside him roars in anger and rushes forward to fight with a knife against that person. On the other side, another brother holds two knives and is still entangled with two men in black. He dodges left and right, swiftly rotating his single knife in search of an opportunity to exploit.
0:47:53|0:48:1|The junior sister who came in from outside the courtyard, holding a long-handled short-blade knife, was seen quickly rotating the long handle, and the front short blade also spun faster and faster.
0:48:1|0:48:12|She then swung the long handle and hit the black man's neck, knocking him to the ground. At this point, the brother with the single knife was already running out of strength. After struggling to block several attacks, he unexpectedly left an opening.
0:48:12|0:48:22|The two of them flew up at the same time and kicked with force, causing the person to fall backwards. He used a single knife to support his body and flipped back to the ground. At this moment, the black-clothed person who was trying to assassinate Guangzi had already become bloodthirsty.
0:48:22|0:48:38|He swung his knife and struck again, pushing the person in front of him aside. Watching the junior sister next to him still struggling to resist, he charged forward again with the blood-stained big knife. After dodging several attacks, the junior sister was finally kicked into a pile of debris. Captain [Yang Kenan] hurriedly arrived in the courtyard with his weapon.
0:48:38|0:48:47|What was seen was Guangzi lying on the ground, covered in blood. When he turned to look at the villain in front of him, the sadness in his eyes instantly turned into anger, and the villain looked at Captain [Yang Kenan] and said.
0:48:50|0:49:7|Captain [Yang Kenan] stared at the opponent, his eyes seemed to be burning with anger. His hand holding the short axe trembled slightly as he approached step by step. The villain opposite him cautiously watched him, only to see Captain [Yang Kenan] swiftly pick up the short axe and strike. With each swing, it seemed like he was exerting all his strength. The villain kept retreating, while Captain [Yang Kenan] continued to press forward relentlessly.
0:49:7|0:49:19|Later, he picked up the iron knife in his other hand and struck the man's knee. On the other side, a man in black rushed forward with a knife towards the injured henchman. At that moment, a bamboo basket flew over and hit the man's head directly. His accomplice turned to look.
0:49:19|0:49:31|Discovering that [Yang Kenan]'s wife is standing on the opposite side. She rushes forward with a knife, but she dodges to the side and then kicks the man in the throat, forcefully pinning him to the ground. Her subordinates are confronting the men in black with a jack, but accidentally injure her foot.
0:49:31|0:49:46|[Yang Kenan]'s wife limped backwards, with a black-clothed person wielding a knife closing in step by step. She picked up a bamboo basket to block, but it was cut in half by a single stroke. However, the sharp teeth of the bamboo basket happened to become a defensive weapon. With a strong swing of her hands, terrifying bloodstains appeared on the person's face.
0:49:46|0:49:54|At this moment, [Yang Kenan] was still entangled with the villain, his fingers swiftly spinning the short axe in his hand before rising to block the man's broadsword.
0:49:54|0:50:5|As the man struggled, [Yang Kenan] lifted his leg and kicked the opponent's knee. The villain stepped back in pain, then grabbed a stool and threw it straight at the man's head. [Yang Kenan] finished him off with a short axe.
0:50:5|0:50:22|Later, [Yang Kenan] turned to look at another villain leader, only to see the man glaring and rushing forward with a knife. [Yang Kenan] calmly blocked it, and his henchmen immediately came to help. At this moment, a sinister laughter broke the silence in the backyard. [Yang Kenan] cautiously walked to the front door, opened a gap, and looked into the backyard.
0:50:22|0:50:33|In the prison, [Cao Shaolin] was seen laughing while taking off his outer garment. At that moment, the brother with a saber bent down to dodge the attack from behind, but unexpectedly, another person in front delivered a sweeping leg kick. He tried to evade it, only to be caught from behind.
0:50:36|0:50:39|A kick landed on the ground. Everyone held their weapons, looking at the two black-clothed figures in front of them.
0:50:41|0:50:55|Come on, after finishing speaking, the two men in black ran away in opposite directions. The leader jumped up along the wooden pole in the courtyard, and the man with curly hair immediately ran forward. Unexpectedly, the black-clothed man protecting the leader turned around and swung his knife. Then, he quickly used the momentum to climb up the pole and escape. The brothers hurriedly chased after them.
0:51:4|0:51:13|The brothers held [Guangzai], who was lying on the ground, in their arms. [Yang Kenan] also slowly walked over, looking at Guangzai's half-open eyes on the corpse. He slowly squatted down, putting down the weapon in his hand.
0:51:13|0:51:26|Heartbroken [Yang Kenan] reached out to touch Guangzi's head, the people of Pucheng gathered at [Yang Kenan]'s doorstep, fear evident in everyone's eyes. [Yang Kenan]'s wife limped out from the courtyard, tears in her eyes as she saw Guangzi's body.
0:51:26|0:51:34|The brother holding a single knife roared. Everyone hurried to stop the impulsive Zhang Wu, and Yang Kenan quickly followed.
0:51:36|0:51:42|The one speaking looked at the scene in front of him, abruptly stopped, and [Zhang Wu] looked up at [Cao Shaolin] in the prison with wide eyes.
0:51:42|0:51:53|Behind him, [Yang Kenan] frowned, only to see the white cloth already tied to the beam. [Cao Shaolin] looked at the people in front of him, then he smiled and stuck his head in, kicking away the stool beneath his feet.
0:51:53|0:52:6|At this moment, [Cao Shaolin], suspended in mid-air, kept kicking his feet, soon rolling his eyes and foaming at the mouth. [Yang Kenan] behind him was shocked, taking a few steps forward, while the curly-haired man beside him watched this scene in astonishment, his eyes wide open.
0:52:6|0:52:15|The two henchmen stood still, unsure of what to do. At this moment, [Cao Shaolin]'s body tremors became smaller and smaller, with foam continuously spewing from his mouth, causing the curly-haired man to shout in panic.
0:52:32|0:52:46|Cao Shaolin, with foam at the corner of his mouth, finally woke up. He coughed hard while laughing. The curly-haired man was scared and leaned against the wall, breathing heavily. Cao Shaolin spat, laughing as he spoke.
0:53:2|0:53:8|Cao Shaolin, who was laughing and lying on the ground, slowly sat up and looked teasingly at Yang Kenan.
0:53:12|0:53:31|[Cao Shaolin], with a mouth full of foam, clapped and laughed, while the curly-haired man who had already sat on the ground weakly moved the clothes he used to hang himself to the side. At this moment, [Ma Feng] arrived outside [Cao Shaolin]'s tent. Soon after, a soldier at the door went inside the tent to report the situation.
0:53:35|0:53:45|[Zhang Wu] furrowed his brow, looking at the three eggs on the table. Then, he picked up one and played with it in his hand. At that moment, [Ma Feng] swaggered in from outside the tent, and as he approached the long table, he stopped in his tracks.
0:53:45|0:54:1|[Zhang Wu] heard footsteps and slowly looked up. When the two made eye contact, they both showed a meaningful look. At this moment, [Zhang Wu] swung the egg in his hand, and [Ma Feng], standing in place, raised his left hand and easily caught it. [Ma Feng] looked down at the egg in his hand, raised his head in confusion, but the other person just stared at him sternly.
0:54:1|0:54:13|At this moment, [Zhang Wu] suddenly stood up, and [Ma Feng] also walked towards him. As the two approached, [Zhang Wu] looked at [Ma Feng]'s face, and his eyes gradually softened. On the other side, [Ma Feng] was awkwardly rolling his eyes and looking around.
0:54:13|0:54:26|Looking at the strange look in the other person's eyes, [Zhang Wu] raised his clenched fist, while [Ma Feng] squinted his eyes and wrinkled his face. [Zhang Wu] was at a loss, gently punched his chest.
0:54:27|0:54:34|After speaking, he touched his stubble and nodded, said [Zhang Wu].
0:54:44|0:54:53|[Ma Feng] picked up the wine jar and tapped it, while [Zhang Wu] chuckled lightly and said. He looked slightly surprised and continued.
0:56:6|0:56:15|[Ma Feng] is crouching over the map, looking up at [Zhang Wu]. The latter looks at him with a smile, places the wine jar on the table, then pulls out a chair and sits down.
0:57:2|0:57:14|[Zhang Wu]'s words made [Ma Feng]'s eyes dim in an instant. He fell silent for a moment before turning to speak. The anger in [Zhang Wu]'s eyes showed no sign of diminishing. [Ma Feng] was now lost in painful memories.
0:57:15|0:57:30|In the memory, a man was crazily waving a knife towards [Ma Feng], while [Zhang Wu], also known as senior brother [Zhang Yi], was fighting with others holding a long spear. He used the spear as a pivot point, sweeping around and kicking away the bandits beside him one by one. [Ma Feng] kicked a bandit away and said.
0:57:56|0:58:6|Senior Brother [Zhang Yi] looked at the person on the ground and said coldly. At this moment, a box with the emblem of the escort agency fell down from behind, and a woman ran out crying and shouted.
0:58:18|0:58:29|At this moment, [Zhang Yi] forcefully shook off his hand and went to help the official. The angry man thrust his sword horizontally, only to be lifted by [Zhang Yi]'s long spear. Seeing the opportunity, the official immediately raised his big knife and thrust forward.
0:59:2|0:59:11|At this moment, the brothers around him all looked at him in silence. The couple killed by the corrupt official lay together on the side, and he still held the big knife in his hand, unwilling to put it down.
0:59:14|0:59:22|Unwilling [Ma Feng] was so angry that his face twitched, but when he thought that he might bring trouble to his innocent brothers in the escort agency, he had to suppress his anger and slowly put down the big knife in his hand.
0:59:22|0:59:41|On the other side, [Zhang Yi] saw him compromise and quickly put away his long spear. [Ma Feng] lowered his head in silence for a moment, then raised it and said bitterly. Then he walked to a distant hillside, and when he picked up the big knife with the dart bureau logo again, [Ma Feng]'s eyes were filled with resentment.
0:59:41|0:59:53|He forcefully plunged the knife into the ground, then kicked it in half. The section with the handle, narrowly missed [Zhang Yi]'s face, and stuck straight into the tree trunk, causing the two to part ways.
1:0:1|1:0:10|[Ma Feng] looked at his senior brother with a serious expression, gave a bitter smile, then picked up the egg in his hand and shook it at him, saying.
1:0:11|1:0:18|After speaking, he glared at [Zhang Yi] and turned to leave, only to hear shouting from behind. [Ma Feng] stopped in his tracks and turned around.
1:0:19|1:0:33|[Zhang Yi] completely crushed [Ma Feng]'s last hope with his words. Without waiting for a response, he left the camp without looking back. In the prison yard at night, [Cao Shaolin] was sitting inside with his eyes closed, leaning back as if half asleep, his chest rising and falling with each breath.
1:0:33|1:0:42|A familiar figure was seen swiftly leaping down from the roof. The sneaky Ma Feng looked towards Cao Shaolin inside, then leaned against the prison door and whispered.
1:0:48|1:0:59|[Cao Shaolin] cautiously watched the stranger who was picking the lock. [Ma Feng] had a toothpick in his mouth, then took out a small blade and inserted it into the lock. At this moment, [Cao Shaolin] revealed a sly smile of unknown meaning.
1:1:10|1:1:20|[Ma Feng] looked at him in this state and said.
1:1:24|1:1:31|[Ma Feng] leaned against the prison gate, pondering for a moment, then muttered in annoyance to himself.
1:1:33|1:1:41|He, deep in thought, raised his head in annoyance, only to find Captain [Yang Kenan] standing behind him. Startled, [Ma Feng] widened his eyes as Captain [Yang Kenan] threw the key directly at him.
1:1:41|1:1:57|[Ma Feng] took the key and held it in his hand. Captain [Yang Kenan] nodded towards the door lock, indicating to open it. With a look of confusion, [Ma Feng] glanced at him, then turned around to insert the key and unlock the door. Inside, [Cao Shaolin] was sitting with one foot on the bench, smiling and shaking his head at him.
1:1:57|1:2:5|Then he raised his chin towards the direction of [Yang Kenan], the leader. [Ma Feng] turned around and spoke.
1:2:6|1:2:13|After speaking, he threw the key over. Captain [Yang Kenan] caught the key and said to [Ma Feng]. Then he walked towards the prison while saying.
1:2:16|1:2:21|[Yang Kenan] stared at [Cao Shaolin] in the prison, getting closer step by step, with deeper meaning in his eyes.
1:2:44|1:2:50|[Yang Kenan] listened without changing his expression, while [Cao Shaolin] spoke to the back of [Ma Feng].
1:2:57|1:3:12|[Ma Feng] looked at [Cao Shaolin]'s disgusting attitude with a look of disgust, while [Yang Kenan] clenched his teeth in anger. At this moment, the curly-haired man's back appeared at the entrance of Cheng Liqian Pawnshop. After the door opened, two henchmen stood on the left and right sides respectively.
1:3:12|1:3:27|A servant walked at the front, leading the way. Another large door opened, and the curly-haired man followed the servant up the stairs. Upon entering, Bai Ling, along with the influential elders of Pucheng, gathered together. Seeing the curly-haired man come in, Bai Ling spoke up and asked.
1:3:30|1:3:43|In the dimly lit lakeside, [Yang Kenan] heard footsteps approaching as he looked around with a kerosene lamp in hand. When he saw the old [Brother Liao] crouching on the bridge, he quickened his pace towards him. The crouching old [Brother Liao] hugged his arms tightly in the cold wind, but his inner restlessness made it hard for him to stay still.
1:3:54|1:4:11|Watching the flustered expression of old [Brother Liao], [Yang Kenan] felt puzzled. Walking ahead, old [Brother Liao] kept wiping the sweat off his forehead. Then, he took out some food from his pocket and handed it over.
1:4:34|1:4:44|[Yang Kenan] didn't say anything, took a bite of the pastry in his hand. Then, he patted [Brother Liao] and asked.
1:4:59|1:5:4|[Yang Kenan] said to [Brother Liao] after listening. He took a bite of the biscuit and lowered his head.
1:6:38|1:6:53|Brother Liao's kneeling made Yang Kenan feel extremely distressed. But for the future of the people of Pucheng, he couldn't back down. Following that, he stepped forward, bowed his head, and said to Brother Liao.
1:7:1|1:7:20|At this moment, [Yang Kenan] had tears in his eyes as he continued speaking. He looked up at the dark night sky, with a determined gleam in his eyes. Then, he spoke towards the distance. Furrowing his brows, his gaze sharp, he then uttered helplessly.
1:7:30|1:7:36|He grabbed Brother Liao by the collar, lifted him up, and said.
1:7:42|1:7:56|Watching [Yang Kenan] with red eyes, [Brother Liao] nodded at him with tears streaming down his face. Under the suppression of evil forces and the pressure of bearing the lives of the entire city, after many years of brotherhood, he would rather sacrifice himself to protect Pucheng. At this moment, [Brother Liao] finally understood his persistence and his righteousness.
1:7:56|1:7:59|He gave Captain [Yang Kenan] a heavy pat on the shoulder and was about to leave.
1:8:1|1:8:14|Hearing the shouts, Brother Liao turned his head in panic. A group of people holding torches aggressively walked onto the wooden bridge. Captain Yang Kenan looked towards the other end of the bridge, only to see another group of people and horses appearing before him, with Wang Weihu, the steward of Boss Liu, leading the way.
1:8:14|1:8:21|He walked over arrogantly, with his henchmen behind him showing fierce expressions. Brother Liao took a deep breath and asked.
1:8:47|1:9:2|On both sides of the wooden bridge, the lake water made a strange sound, one bamboo board after another rose from the lake surface, extending all the way to the end of the bridge. The sharp bamboo tips, illuminated by torches, appeared even sharper. Gaps between the anchored boats also gradually revealed rows of bamboo tips.
1:9:2|1:9:15|Seeing the bamboo trap with no way out in front of them, Brother Liao's eyes went from panic to determination. At that moment, Wang Weihu's henchman suddenly reached out with a spear with a torch on it. Brother Liao quickly opened his arms and shielded Captain Yang Kenan behind him.
1:9:16|1:9:23|Captain [Yang Kenan] was seen protecting Brother Liao with one hand, while throwing a long spear with flames on it with the other hand. The spear, under the lash of the long whip, sparked and splattered with fire.
1:9:24|1:9:32|Faced with such a powerful opponent, the henchmen holding spears all took a few steps back. Brother Liao shouted loudly at [Yang Kenan], the team leader.
1:9:32|1:9:47|After speaking, old Brother Liao turned around to deal with the person behind him. He walked forward, picked up the kerosene lamp in his hand, and used the flaming spear to knock aside the consecutive thrusts of the spear. He bent down to dodge and directly kicked the person onto the bamboo board in the water. On the other side, Wang Weihu's henchman rushed over with a spear.
1:9:47|1:10:2|Captain [Yang Kenan] cracked his whip accurately, tightly entangling the upper body of the man. In the next moment, the man's body soared into the air and landed straight on the sharp bamboo tip on the side. The three men behind were stunned to see this, as Captain [Yang Kenan] cracked his whip, entwining the three men's spears together.
1:10:2|1:10:14|In an instant, sparks flew everywhere, and the long whip turned darker under the scorching flames. Old Brother Liao snatched the enemy's spear and fended off attacks from others on both sides. Unexpectedly, at this moment, a crescent-shaped curved blade was pressed against his waist.
1:10:14|1:10:22|The intense burning sensation penetrated through the clothing and reached the skin. Old Brother Liao let out a painful howl. Then, the man actually lifted old Brother Liao with a machete and threw him behind.
1:10:22|1:10:38|Lying on the ground, old [Brother Liao] was covered in blood, struggling to lift his head and feeling extremely guilty as he watched Captain [Yang Kenan] fall into a trap. At that moment, one of his subordinates holding a spear said to him. After that, they turned and ran towards Captain [Yang Kenan].
1:10:38|1:10:48|Captain [Yang Kenan], who sensed the danger, turned around and bent over to whip out the long whip, wrapping around someone's ankle. He then straightened the whip, placed his other hand on it, and effortlessly flung the person out.
1:10:48|1:11:0|Suddenly, someone rushed up from behind. [Yang Kenan] wrapped around the person's knee and pulled hard, making him kneel straight on the ground. Unexpectedly, at this moment, a long spear appeared. [Yang Kenan] flew and stepped on it, walking up along the pole.
1:11:0|1:11:9|With another kick to the head of the man, seeing his henchmen almost half dead, [Wang Weihu] hiding in the back couldn't hold back any longer. He shouted and charged forward with a crescent blade in hand.
1:11:9|1:11:18|[Yang Kenan] dodged the close-range attacks from left and right, trying to create distance for his whip strikes. He took a few steps back and then unleashed his skillful long whip, forcing [Wang Weihu] to retreat repeatedly.
1:11:19|1:11:31|The one-eyed henchman behind saw the boss struggling and immediately stepped forward to help. [Yang Kenan] gritted his teeth and blocked attack after attack. At this moment, Brother Liao behind him stood up with a spear in hand, roaring angrily, and charged forward with the spear.
1:11:31|1:11:37|Brother Liao stabbed straight into the man blocking the way. Unexpectedly, Yang Kenan was cunningly attacked from behind by Wang Weihu.
1:11:40|1:11:45|[Yang Kenan], ignoring his wound, swung his whip backhandedly, and the long whip landed directly on the left side of [Wang Weihu]'s face, leaving a sudden blood mark.
1:11:46|1:11:56|Later, he was thrown a somersault by the domineering Hou Li, and fell directly to the ground. Brother Liao, standing in front of him, stood up with his hand on the wound, Bai Ling got up, and looked at him fiercely.
1:11:56|1:12:13|He picked up the crescent blade and easily blocked Brother Liao's feeble attack. Then, he split the spear in half, followed by forcefully thrusting it into Brother Liao's chest. Captain Yang saw this scene and shouted. Brother Liao's mouth spurted blood, while Wang Weihu stared with wide eyes and gritted his teeth.
1:12:20|1:12:31|[Wang Weihu] gritted his teeth and forcefully pierced through old [Brother Liao]'s body. Old [Brother Liao] lost too much blood, looked up at the dark and lightless night sky, and finally fell straight back, dropping onto the wooden bridge.
1:12:32|1:12:44|On the other side, Commander Yang cracked his whip, sending his opponent flying onto the bamboo tip on the lake. Seeing this, his men grabbed their spears and fled in panic. Commander Yang then turned around, dragging his whip as he slowly walked towards [Wang Weihu].
1:12:44|1:13:1|Feeling the murderous intent, [Wang Weihu] tightened the curved machete in his hand and shouted to prepare for an attack. Unexpectedly, Captain Yang cracked his whip and knocked the machete out of his hand. Then, he wrapped the whip around Wang's ankle and pulled it back. [Wang Weihu] defiantly knelt up, but Captain Yang immediately wrapped the whip around his neck.
1:13:1|1:13:14|He stepped on the back of [Wang Weihu] with one foot and pulled back with force with his other hand. At this moment, [Wang Weihu], whose face was turning red from being strangled, reached out his hands and struggled frantically. Captain Yang pulled back forcefully again, and soon, the person kneeling on the ground became motionless.
1:13:14|1:13:22|After successfully avenging, Captain Yang threw away his whip, walked beside old [Brother Liao], and squatted down. Old [Brother Liao], with blood all over his mouth, struggled to lift his head and looked at Captain Yang.
1:13:22|1:13:35|He opened his mouth slightly, as if wanting to say something, but only a heavy hoarse sound came out of his throat. Captain Yang looked at Brother Liao's appearance, holding back the tears in his eyes. After a while, Brother Liao gradually lost his breath, but his eyes still did not leave Captain Yang Kenan.
1:13:35|1:13:44|For many years, the comrade-in-arms who lost his life in battle filled Captain [Yang Kenan]'s heart with guilt. He silently bent down and lifted the body of old [Brother Liao] onto his back.
1:13:44|1:14:0|At this moment, scattered bodies lay in front and behind the wooden bridge, and the boats by the lake had been set on fire by the flames of the spears at some point. Captain [Yang Kenan] carried old [Brother Liao] and walked towards the lake shore in the firelight. He held tightly onto both hands and legs of old [Brother Liao], taking firm steps forward.
1:14:0|1:14:8|The death of old Brother Liao seemed to be the final straw that overwhelmed Captain Yang Kenan's heart, prompting him to question whether what he had done was right or wrong.
1:14:8|1:14:23|At this moment, a figure on horseback appeared on the misty shore, Captain [Yang Kenan] looked up and saw [Ma Feng] arriving slowly, stopping in front of him, silently looking at himself. As [Ma Feng] looked at the scene before him, he felt resentment in his heart. But at this moment, the person he felt more sympathy for was Captain [Yang Kenan].
1:14:23|1:14:38|The lack of understanding from the people of Pucheng almost cost him his life, but his original intention was to protect all the people of Pucheng. Late at night on the streets, all the people of Pucheng hurried to Captain [Yang Kenan]'s house in panic, discussing quietly in the courtyard.
1:14:38|1:14:42|The news of the death of old Brother Liao quickly spread to everyone's ears.
1:14:43|1:14:51|The people wept with worried faces, concerned about their future. Two henchmen ran out of the courtyard and urged the gathered people to leave.
1:14:52|1:14:57|Inside the house, [Zhang Wu] kept touching Brother Liao's face, tears already swirling in his eyes.
1:14:57|1:15:10|Next, he let out a regretful roar, while a brother beside him bowed his head and sighed in the corner, and another brother stood with his hands on his hips, looking slightly angry at the body lying in front of him. [Zhang Wu] took out a handkerchief and gently wiped the blood from Brother Liao's mouth.
1:15:10|1:15:19|At this moment by the wall in the backyard, Captain [Yang Kenan], who narrowly escaped death, tightly embraced his wife who was crying bitterly, comforting her softly while patting her back.
1:15:19|1:15:31|At this moment, the tender care comforted his shattered heart, and he vowed to protect all the people in Pucheng. But the one he cared most about was his own bedmate. At this moment, someone inside the house shouted.
1:15:44|1:15:58|[Zhang Wu] led his brothers to the courtyard, only to find that the common people of Pucheng were all standing outside Mr. Liu's door. When they heard the commotion, they turned to look at [Zhang Wu] and the others.
1:16:13|1:16:24|Captain [Yang Kenan] comforted [Zhang Wu] and then walked forward. Some people among the commoners believed Boss Liu's slander and had already started to look coldly at Captain [Yang Kenan]. The women were crying in fear, quietly lifting their sleeves to wipe away tears.
1:16:24|1:16:32|At this moment, [Ma Feng] sat on the roof from a distance, observing the scene in front of him. Then, a woman spoke first.
1:17:3|1:17:11|After listening to everyone's dissuasion, Captain [Yang Kenan] looked at all the people around him. Everyone was waiting for an answer. He took a few steps forward and spoke.
1:17:25|1:17:42|After speaking, there was another round of murmurs in the crowd, with everyone sharing their inner worries. Boss Liu and others stood in front of their own door, looking smugly at the pressured Captain [Yang Kenan]. His subordinates stood on the side, silent, with one of them tightly pressing his lips, suppressing his emotions.
1:18:13|1:18:26|Seeing the old man kneeling in front of [Yang Kenan], with people behind him praying and kneeling down one after another. Witnessing this scene, [Yang Kenan] felt a mix of emotions in his heart. What he didn't expect was that his good intentions had now become a burden for the people.
1:18:26|1:18:43|Captain [Yang Kenan]'s wife looked at the kneeling man, her eyes gradually becoming indifferent. Captain [Yang Kenan] sighed softly as he stood in place. At this moment, Cao Shaolin stood inside the prison, looking up at the brightening sky and laughing. [Ma Feng], sitting on the rooftop, saw this scene and felt uneasy.
1:18:43|1:18:47|At this moment, a henchman standing next to [Yang Kenan], the leader, shouted into the crowd.
1:19:3|1:19:15|The young man knelt down without saying a word. Captain [Yang Kenan] felt a pang of sadness at the sight. Unexpectedly, the guards behind him from the security team also knelt down one after another, leaving Captain [Yang Kenan] feeling increasingly disheartened with no one standing behind him.
1:19:15|1:19:19|[Ma Feng] looked at [Yang Kenan]'s face, as if he had already sensed the loss in his heart.
1:19:20|1:19:34|[Yang Kenan] turned around, looking at the people kneeling in front of him, and then at the few subordinates standing beside him. He couldn't help but reflect on his past insistence, which led to the deaths of Guangzi and Brother Liao. Now he was being forced by the people to release the murderous demon.
1:19:34|1:19:40|Thinking the other way around, the people just want to live, they want their next generation to live in this ancestral homeland.
1:19:42|1:19:50|After much deliberation, [Yang Kenan] silently shook his head and then walked into the crowd, speaking.
1:20:25|1:20:40|[Yang Kenan] finished speaking and walked away. His wife watched his lonely figure, tears welling up in her eyes. The people of Pucheng heard his words, crying and bending down on the ground. Perhaps only in this way could they alleviate the guilt in their hearts towards the Yang family for generations.
1:20:40|1:20:51|Seeing the people lying on the ground, [Ma Feng] also felt anxious. He could hardly imagine what Pu City would be like without [Yang Kenan]. Once that murderous demon is released tomorrow,
1:20:51|1:21:7|Kneeling on the ground, do these people still have a chance to survive? As [Yang Kenan] walked towards the house, he looked up at [Ma Feng]. At this moment, [Ma Feng] also looked at him with a slight hint of confusion. After [Yang Kenan] disappeared from sight, he picked up the toothpick in his hand and put it in his mouth, frowning as he looked at the pitch-black sky.
1:21:14|1:21:24|[Yang Kenan] gently took down the family portrait painted by his daughter on the wall, with his wife standing behind him, silently watching. When [Yang Kenan] turned around, he saw his wife's eyes turning red, her expression still serious.
1:21:24|1:21:32|He then reached out his hand and handed over the neatly folded family photo, followed by embracing his wife tightly.
1:21:39|1:21:44|[Yang Kenan] paused for a moment and continued speaking.
1:21:45|1:21:51|At this moment, a round of sunrise gradually rises from the east, and [Mrs. Liu] leads everyone to the prison gate in a hurry.
1:22:24|1:22:33|At this moment, [Yang Kenan] is playing with his daughter.
1:22:56|1:23:11|Contented [Yang Kenan] looked at his daughter's adorable face and couldn't help but give her a kiss. Then, he reached out his hand and hugged the little one tightly, tears already welling up in his eyes. Following that, he reluctantly kissed the soft cheek once again.
1:23:11|1:23:20|At this moment, the wife with the still unhealed foot injury leaned on a long stick and entered the hall. Several henchmen carrying luggage followed behind her, and one of them stepped forward and spoke.
1:23:34|1:23:40|Yang Kenan's wife forced a smile in response. Everyone lowered their heads uncomfortably. Zhang Wu put down the burden and said.
1:23:51|1:24:0|After Zhang Wu finished speaking, his lips trembled uncontrollably. Yang Kenan looked at him and nodded silently. Everyone bent down to bow to the captain without prior agreement.
1:24:2|1:24:18|Everyone stood up straight, looking at [Yang Kenan] with solemn expressions, then slowly turned and walked out the door. [Yang Kenan] kept his head down, unable to look at the departing figures. As everyone walked further away, he lifted his head and looked at his wife beside him. His wife, trying to appear strong, gave him a relieved smile.
1:24:18|1:24:33|Yang Kenan then walked out of the door without looking back, holding his daughter's hand. Standing still, he watched his loved ones leaving, feeling a sudden pain in his heart. His wife, who dared not turn back, struck a deep chord in his heart. At that moment, his daughter turned around and waved to Yang Kenan.
1:24:33|1:24:50|His hand reached out stiffly, waving weakly. The figures of the mother and daughter became increasingly blurred. [Yang Kenan] turned around, placing his fingers on his eyelids and rubbing hard. His once straight back was now curled up, as he pressed his eyelids tightly with his fingers, trying hard to control his collapsing inner self.
1:24:50|1:24:59|After pausing for a moment in place, he took a few heavy steps forward. Then, he opened his eyes and reached out to touch the still warm table and chairs.
1:25:18|1:25:25|[Yang Kenan] glanced at [Ma Feng], lowered his head and smiled helplessly, then he looked at [Ma Feng] and said.
1:25:29|1:25:40|[Ma Feng] was so surprised by [Yang Kenan]'s actions that he couldn't say a word. He turned his head, pursed his lips, and glanced at [Yang Kenan]. Without saying anything more, he turned around and left the courtyard, heading towards the door.
1:25:40|1:25:48|[Yang Kenan] has been watching [Ma Feng] walking away. Perhaps, compared to the responsibilities on his shoulders, at this moment, he is also envious of [Ma Feng]'s carefree and casual attitude.
1:25:48|1:26:5|It is also because of this responsibility that he has become the guardian who lives up to the generations of the Yang family. At this moment, the bumpy carriage is crowded with children, all quietly waiting to go to another unfamiliar place. [Ma Feng] rides at the front, with a coachman waving to them at the intersection.
1:26:5|1:26:13|At this moment, the people of Pucheng stood on both sides of the road, [Zhang Yi] rode a horse, leading a few soldiers, and aggressively entered the city gate.
1:26:13|1:26:29|He looked around at the people standing there with a proud expression on his face, then headed straight for the courtyard of [Yang Kenan]. Inside the courtyard, [Yang Kenan] sat in the hall, watching the doorway while swinging the long whip in his hand. The whip spun in a spiral in [Yang Kenan]'s hand as the soldiers lined up in the courtyard.
1:26:29|1:26:40|[Zhang Yi] dismounted and led his men into the courtyard. He glanced at [Yang Kenan] and headed straight for the backyard. At that moment, the whip in [Yang Kenan]'s hand also fell to the ground.
1:26:41|1:26:50|A large group of soldiers with guns rushed into the backyard, causing the kneeling civilians to scatter in fear. [Zhang Yi] and another henchman behind him strode to the prison gate, where he bowed and said.
1:27:18|1:27:25|[Yang Kenan] walked out from the prison gate, and the soldiers around all turned to look. Inside the prison, [Cao Shaolin] smiled.
1:27:26|1:27:40|At this moment, the people of Pucheng were all looking at [Yang Kenan] with worried expressions, but the current situation made everyone feel particularly embarrassed. [Yang Kenan] looked around and none of the people nearby dared to meet his eyes. He turned the key in his hand and slowly walked towards the prison.
1:27:41|1:27:48|He calmly walked up to [Zhang Yi] and then pushed away the henchmen who had caused trouble at his house.
1:27:49|1:28:5|The henchman angrily shook his clothes and gave a fierce glance at [Yang Kenan], while inside the prison, [Cao Shaolin] watched with interest. Then, [Yang Kenan] walked to the door, unlocked the iron lock with a key, stood at the doorway with a cold face, and looked at [Cao Shaolin] who appeared smug.
1:28:5|1:28:15|Cao Shaolin stood up, walked out with a smile, and approached Yang Kenan, staring provocatively into his eyes. Then he slowly turned his body around, revealing his handcuffed hands.
1:28:15|1:28:23|He turned his head and glanced at [Yang Kenan], then shook his hand. [Yang Kenan] had no choice but to pick up the keys again and personally unlock the handcuffs for him.
1:28:25|1:28:33|[Cao Shaolin] gestured with his hand and handed the gun to [Yang Kenan], saying.
1:28:49|1:29:4|[Yang Kenan] held the knife and looked at the people standing around. Everyone stared with anxious expressions, shaking their heads repeatedly at him. On the side, Boss Liu quietly shifted his gaze elsewhere. [Yang Kenan] lowered his head in disappointment, sighed, and then let out a helpless laugh.
1:29:4|1:29:9|The laughter was filled with desolation and heroism, [Yang Kenan] thought for a moment, then looked up and said to [Cao Shaolin].
1:29:34|1:29:43|After speaking, [Cao Shaolin] turned his back and walked out of the courtyard. The piercing laughter filled the entire courtyard, while [Zhang Yi] stood still with a serious expression.
1:30:6|1:30:16|Mrs. Liu, who was stabbed several times, spat out blood and fell headfirst onto the dining table. Cao Shaolin took out a handkerchief and quietly wiped the blood off his hands. Then, he smiled and said to the others.
1:30:22|1:30:30|Shortly after, he quickly pulled out his gun and shot the two people who were moving chopsticks. The soldiers standing at the door, seeing the young marshal walking out, immediately opened fire and sprayed the remaining people in the Liu residence.
1:30:32|1:30:38|After the massacre, all the valuable items in the Liu Mansion were moved onto the carts of the Cao army. At this time, the streets of Pucheng were filled with soldiers looting everywhere.
1:30:40|1:30:47|Helpless civilians knelt on the ground, crying and wailing. Some were dragged to open spaces and immediately executed by firing squad, their screams echoing in every corner.
1:30:49|1:30:57|The slightly valuable belongings of poor families were looted clean, even the bracelets on women's wrists were forcibly taken off and snatched away.
1:31:4|1:31:10|She smiled and nodded at her daughter, then continued speaking.
1:31:11|1:31:22|Seeing her daughter's obedient appearance, she couldn't help but reach out and hold her tightly in her arms, tears streaming down her face at that moment. She didn't know if they would ever meet again after this farewell.
1:31:22|1:31:35|[Zhang Wu] and the other senior brothers came to bid farewell at the graves of Liao and Guang. They looked solemnly at the cold tombstone in front of them. Meanwhile, the children of Shitoucheng had already been sent to the school in the provincial capital. Everyone tearfully ran towards their new teachers.
1:31:36|1:31:51|[Ma Feng] stood at the door and spoke to the teacher. He couldn't bear to look at the children, then turned and walked away.
1:32:8|1:32:14|[Ma Feng] said nothing more and got up to leave.
1:32:20|1:32:37|The boys looked at [Ma Feng] with worry on their faces, while the little girl beside them couldn't stop crying. On the other side, the woman with the children rode away on horseback. [Yang Kenan]'s wife stood in place, watching the back of her daughter leaving with a peaceful expression. Soon, the reluctance in her eyes was replaced by determination. She quickly mounted the horse,
1:32:44|1:32:56|The shouts of the brothers behind her made her immediately pull the reins and stop in place. Looking at the loyal brotherhood, [Yang Kenan]'s wife was filled with gratitude, everyone willingly risking danger to come back and rescue others, the spirit of righteousness also made her extremely admiring.
1:32:56|1:33:11|At this moment, the sound of horse hooves came from the opposite woods, and the figure of [Ma Feng] riding a horse gradually appeared in front of them. [Yang Kenan]'s wife looked at the familiar figure, feeling quite excited inside. [Ma Feng] frowned, stopped in front of them, and then looked at the righteous men around him.
1:33:11|1:33:18|Captain Yang's wife held back tears in her eyes, while others looked friendly at [Ma Feng] who came to the rescue at this moment.
1:33:27|1:33:38|Captain Yang's wife looked at [Ma Feng] with a hint of admiration in her eyes. This stranger had only known her husband for a few months, but now he was willing to risk danger to return to the ancient city and save people with her.
1:33:38|1:33:49|She understood that it was the sense of inner justice that bound them together, sparing the need for words of gratitude. They once again wielded their swords and rode into the bloody path of breaking through the encirclement.
1:33:49|1:34:7|They knew how dangerous [Cao Shaolin] was, and understood that once they returned, there would be no turning back. But when they thought about the possibility of their husband being harmed, their elder brother who had been carefully taught for many years falling into the hands of thieves, a person with a heart full of justice, being tortured to death by a despicable person, all of this seemed worth it.
1:34:7|1:34:24|In the backyard filled with wine barrels, several peasants in different attire are struggling to lift a wine barrel and walk towards it. Inside the house, Captain Yang, who is suspended upside down, has his entire upper body straightly placed into the wine barrel. He keeps his eyes open, swaying his body from side to side, barely holding his breath, enduring inhuman torture.
1:34:24|1:34:31|[Cao Shaolin] saw this scene and walked over smugly, saying.
1:34:50|1:34:55|He then raised his hand again to give orders.
1:34:56|1:35:5|At this moment, there was chaos in Pucheng. Soldiers were still looting the belongings of the common people. [Ma Feng] rode up to the gate on horseback. The soldiers guarding the city immediately brandished their long spears as a warning.
1:35:29|1:35:34|He pretended to reach into his pocket, then said solemnly.
1:35:42|1:35:51|[Ma Feng] heard this and smiled triumphantly, then raised his hands in a gesture of surrender. At this moment, one of [Yang Kenan]'s men slipped in through the skylight into the arsenal of the Cao army.
1:35:51|1:35:59|The warehouse is filled with various long guns and a dazzling array of handguns. Another henchman squeezed through the gap in the wooden beams and entered the gunpowder depot.
1:35:59|1:36:10|He cautiously glanced at the soldiers stationed outside the door, then stood up and picked up the explosives placed in front of him. At this moment, Zhang Wu, accompanied by another brother, arrived at the place where the Cao army was having their meal.
1:36:10|1:36:25|Upstairs, they were secretly hiding in the granary, watching the situation below. The old lady downstairs, who was serving tea to the soldiers, wiped her sweat and happened to catch a glimpse of the two hiding in the granary. She stared in surprise. The people upstairs quickly made a quiet gesture and then pointed to the side at her.
1:36:25|1:36:43|The clever [Ma Dongmei] immediately understood, she turned around and quietly conveyed the message to the person pouring water next to her, then walked back into the house. A bag of white powder was poured into the water tank, [Ma Dongmei] quickly scooped a few times with a ladle, and then poured the water into the teapot. The young woman next to her was secretly leaning against the door, keeping watch for the people inside.
1:36:43|1:37:0|The soldiers, who were blindfolded, were preparing everything in an orderly manner. They picked up the water bottle and poured it into the bowl, drinking it with satisfaction. Some even poured more into their own bowls, then drank it down contentedly. However, their bodies immediately had a strong reaction.
1:37:12|1:37:27|Soldiers, under the influence of drugs, lined up to use the toilet. At this moment, [Ma Feng] was brought to where Cao Shaolin was. Suddenly, the guide stopped and said. The person quickly ran up the stairs to report, [Ma Feng] looked up and saw Captain [Yang Kenan]'s body being pulled out of the wine barrel again.
1:37:40|1:37:47|Zhang Yi, standing aside, turned his head and looked, his expression turning to one of shock.
1:37:48|1:38:6|[Ma Feng] impatiently glanced at the person pushing him from behind, then stepped on a pile of ancient artifacts bags beside him and flew to [Cao Shaolin]'s side. As he spoke, he looked at [Zhang Yi] approaching him. When the two passed by each other, [Zhang Yi] looked at him and whispered something.
1:38:8|1:38:14|[Ma Feng] completely ignored him, chuckled indifferently, and then walked straight towards [Cao Shaolin].
1:38:37|1:38:45|With a bewildered look on his face, the henchman was grabbed by [Ma Feng] and pulled over. He took the opportunity to snatch the man's machete, and then pushed him into the arms of [Cao Shaolin] who was shooting.
1:38:46|1:39:2|[Zhang Yi] immediately ran forward and pulled the young marshal up. [Ma Feng] immediately placed the rescued [Captain Yang] on the ground, while the enraged [Cao Shaolin] picked up a gun and fired bullets in succession. However, [Ma Feng] shielded his subordinates who had just been grappling with him until the bullets in [Cao Shaolin]'s gun ran out.
1:39:21|1:39:35|[Cao Shaolin] smiled and glanced at [Zhang Yi], who looked angry. [Zhang Yi] picked up the long spear behind him and rushed out. [Ma Feng] raised the person in front of him by the waist and threw him towards [Zhang Yi]. Then, he leaped over a wine barrel and swung a big knife straight at [Cao Shaolin].
1:39:35|1:39:50|The henchmen standing on both sides immediately stepped forward to protect, but were quickly taken care of in just a few moves. [Zhang Yi] reacted and rushed to stab at [Ma Feng]'s back. [Ma Feng] turned around to block with a big knife, then turned and lifted his leg, pressing it on the long handle, and immediately rushed forward to stab at the approaching [Cao Shaolin].
1:39:50|1:40:5|Who would have expected that [Cao Shaolin] would pull his men over and stand in front. An angry [Ma Feng] kicked the dead body in front of him, along with [Cao Shaolin], into the courtyard filled with nine groups. Seeing this, [Zhang Yi] picked up a long spear and once again engaged in battle with [Ma Feng], only to see him swiftly twirling his weapon in hand.
1:40:5|1:40:14|Following that, with extremely fast attacking speed, he repeatedly stabbed towards Ma Feng's chest. Ma Feng, who was slower in speed, barely managed to block a few moves with his knife, then quickly moved his body backwards.
1:40:14|1:40:33|[Zhang Yi] mercilessly pressed forward, chopping the wine barrels and the stacked firewood into halves one by one. At this moment, the common people in the teahouse held sticks and hid in the attic, quietly waiting for the commotion outside. Inside the gunpowder depot, a flame was quickly approaching the explosives at the end of the fuse.
1:40:37|1:40:54|Soldiers patrolling the city saw the black smoke rising above the military camp and immediately went to investigate. By this time, the Cao army's main camp was already engulfed in artillery fire, and [Yang Kenan]'s subordinates were vigorously throwing explosive packets inside. The soldiers standing guard at the gate were unable to dodge in time and were instantly blasted aside by the powerful explosion force.
1:40:56|1:41:10|The soldier who had just finished relieving himself looked bewildered at the chaos in front of him, when suddenly a bomb dropped from the sky. In an instant, the thatched hut behind him was leveled to the ground. [Cao Shaolin], lying on the ground, heard the explosion and looked up in terror. Flames flickered on the streets of Pucheng.
1:41:10|1:41:22|The sound of explosions rang out repeatedly, and the soldiers standing on both sides were blown into the air, their bodies flying back and forth in the sky. At this moment, when the time was ripe, Zhang Wu kicked open the door and led the civilians with weapons in hand rushing in.
1:41:22|1:41:34|Bai Ling angrily picked up the short knife in his hand and dealt with the soldier who turned his head. Looking around, the young and old in Pucheng, holding either a kitchen knife or a long stick, all ignored the danger and entangled with the soldiers on the street.
1:41:34|1:41:52|The people chased after a person in groups of three or five, with the soldiers without guns having to hold their heads and run away in a panic. In the crowd, [Zhang Wu] immediately spotted the troublemaker who had caused a scene in the hospital before. At this moment, the villain was wielding a big knife and slashing wildly at people. [Zhang Wu] took out a short knife, jumped up to confront him, but still found it difficult to get close.
1:41:52|1:41:56|At this moment, the people behind all pressed down on the villain together, forcing him to the ground.
1:41:57|1:42:9|Peasants working at the distillery worked together to lift Captain [Yang Kenan], who was lying on the side, onto a ladder. Just as the four young men standing outside were about to carry him out, they saw [Cao Shaolin]'s men rushing in with knives.
1:42:9|1:42:20|They immediately dropped the ladder in their hands and ran back. The unconscious Captain [Yang Kenan] fell straight down the stairs. The Captain [Yang Kenan], in unbearable pain, opened his eyes only to see someone wielding a shiny big knife charging towards him.
1:42:20|1:42:33|He grabbed the handle of the knife in the man's hand, flipped him to the ground, and cut his throat in one swift motion. Unexpectedly, someone came from behind, he turned around, lifted his leg, hid the big knife between his legs, and stabbed straight into the person's abdomen, cutting the rope on his feet at the same time.
1:42:33|1:42:46|At this moment, [Cao Shaolin] ran in from the backyard and his expression turned anxious when he saw the chaos on the street. He cautiously bent down to check on Captain [Yang Kenan] lying on the ground. The Captain, pretending to be unconscious, immediately opened his eyes.
1:42:46|1:42:58|Swing the big knife. [Cao Shaolin] immediately steps back to dodge. At this moment, in the backyard filled with wine barrels, [Ma Feng] is still locked in a stalemate with [Zhang Yi], as [Ma Feng] with dual knives desperately dodges the fast gunshots right in front of him. On the other side, [Zhang Yi] doesn't give any chance to relax.
1:42:58|1:43:9|He quickly spun the long spear and thrust it towards Ma Feng's chest along the crisscrossing gaps. Ma Feng took a few steps back and threw the wine barrel under his feet. After Zhang Yi broke the long spear, he also took a few steps back.
1:43:20|1:43:36|After speaking, [Zhang Yi] once again, filled with anger, fiercely attacked [Ma Feng]. The sharp breaking wind made [Ma Feng] retreat repeatedly. In order to avoid the terrifying consecutive attacks, [Ma Feng] turned around and prepared to climb up the highest end of the wine barrel, with [Zhang Yi] closely chasing behind.
1:43:36|1:43:53|Ma Feng's feet stepped on a wine barrel, and the long spear behind him shattered the corresponding wine barrel. He secretly rejoiced that his speed was fast enough to withstand Zhang Yi's amazing strength on the wine barrel. At this moment, Ma Feng suddenly stopped and said.
1:43:58|1:44:10|Watching [Ma Feng] acting nonchalantly, [Zhang Yi] felt the anger rising in his heart once again. The two stood on top of the wine barrels, engaging in battle once more. [Ma Feng] put away his usual unruly smile, and the speed of his sword swings gradually increased.
1:45:33|1:45:48|[Ma Feng] found his foot stuck in the gap between the wine barrels and couldn't pull it out. Seeing this, [Zhang Yi], who had walked away, immediately dropped his spear, ran over, hugged [Ma Feng]'s waist, gave a strong pull, and then threw him to a safe place. However, [Zhang Yi] couldn't escape and was hit directly in the face by a falling wine barrel.
1:45:48|1:45:59|Only hearing the screams of [Zhang Yi], gradually drowned out by the roaring sound of the falling, followed by his entire person disappearing into the thousands of rolling wine barrels.
1:46:0|1:46:5|The sound of the wine barrel rolling gradually faded, [Ma Feng] could only lie on the ground, helplessly looking at the mess.
1:46:5|1:46:22|At this moment, [Yang Kenan]'s wife rode into Pucheng on a horse, holding a cane in her hand, she knocked down the soldiers who were bullying the people one by one. Then, she headed straight for Mrs. [Liu]'s courtyard. At that moment, [Cao Shaolin] rushed out in a panic from inside, ready to chase after her with a cane, but unexpectedly, [Yang Kenan] also came out from inside.
1:46:22|1:46:39|[Yang Kenan], ignoring his wife's dissuasion, followed the direction in which [Cao Shaolin] escaped and went up the stairs. At this moment, in the attic, [Cao Shaolin] opened a drawer containing bullets and hurriedly loaded his gun. He kept an eye on the direction of the door while quickly completing the actions in his hands. Just then, [Yang Kenan] burst in.
1:46:39|1:46:49|Seeing the gun picked up by [Cao Shaolin], he completely disregarded it and walked towards [Cao Shaolin]. His wife, seeing this, picked up a cane and hooked his shoulder, pulling him back. Unexpectedly, her own arm was shot and injured.
1:46:49|1:47:0|Seeing [Cao Shaolin] approaching them, he reached out and lifted the round table in front of him, pushing it towards [Cao Shaolin], and finally, he broke through the round table and swung the knife. [Cao Shaolin] kicked [Yang Kenan] away.
1:47:0|1:47:6|Then he crouched down again to load the bullets. Next, he pulled out the pistol once more and aimed at [Yang Kenan], who was currently dodging.
1:47:6|1:47:15|[Zhang Wu], who was fighting with the soldiers, heard the gunshots coming from the attic. He immediately stepped on the stone lion at the door, broke in through the window, and saw the disheveled Captain [Yang Kenan] on the ground. He shouted out.
1:47:16|1:47:31|[Cao Shaolin] immediately fired in the direction of [Zhang Wu], who dodged while throwing out his own short knife. [Cao Shaolin] tilted his head to successfully dodge. At this moment, two of his own men broke in from the window, wielding big knives to attack. With only a short knife in hand, [Zhang Wu] could only barely defend himself.
1:47:31|1:47:35|Soon after, the three of them started fighting in between Captain [Cao Shaolin] and Captain [Yang Kenan].
1:47:36|1:47:50|The henchman blocking the way in front of Captain [Yang Kenan] was shot dead by [Cao Shaolin]. Meanwhile, [Zhang Wu] easily took down another person. Unexpectedly, [Cao Shaolin] fired again. [Zhang Wu], who was shot, fell down in pain, and [Cao Shaolin] let out a triumphant laugh.
1:47:50|1:48:13|[Yang Kenan] slowly stood up and walked towards [Cao Shaolin]. [Cao Shaolin] held up his gun and silently aimed it in his direction. Then, he burst into a wild laughter again. [Yang Kenan] finally stood still in his place, smiling at him without moving.
1:48:13|1:48:23|In the sinister laughter of [Cao Shaolin], Captain [Yang Kenan] slowly closed his eyes. Bullets flew towards Captain [Yang Kenan], and at that moment, he suddenly picked up a big knife and held it in front of him. Knocked down by the impact, Captain [Yang Kenan] sat on the ground.
1:48:23|1:48:34|On the side, his wife's eyes filled with tears as he slowly picked up the large knife in his hand, only to see a bullet embedded in the blade. [Cao Shaolin] smiled widely, preparing to shoot again, but [Yang Kenan] grabbed a knife.
1:48:34|1:48:50|A shot rang out from the gun pointed at [Cao Shaolin]'s forehead. Before [Cao Shaolin] could react, [Yang Kenan] was already wielding a large knife and charging towards him. Dodging the first strike, [Cao Shaolin] was caught off guard as [Yang Kenan] swiftly rolled back and kicked him onto the balcony railing.
1:48:50|1:48:55|Furious Cao Shaolin was about to shoot again, when Yang Kenan rushed over, kicked him and threw him off the building.
1:48:57|1:49:13|[Cao Shaolin] was seen falling straight down from the eaves, landing next to the stone lion at the door. With blood in his mouth, [Cao Shaolin] lay on the ground. After a while, he suddenly smiled, then slowly got up from the ground. He struggled to stand up, turned around to look upstairs, and a terrifying bloodstain was left on his forehead where the bullet hole was.
1:49:13|1:49:20|At this moment, exhausted [Yang Kenan] was leaning on the railing, staring at him. Then, [Cao Shaolin] smiled and said.
1:49:28|1:49:41|At this moment, the townspeople holding weapons on the street were slowly approaching. [Cao Shaolin], who sensed the threat, put away his smile and looked around. When he saw these powerless townspeople, a look of confusion filled his face.
1:49:41|1:49:49|He then picked up the pistol and pressed the trigger. Unexpectedly, the magazine made a hollow sound. He took a few steps back slowly, then warned the people around him.
1:49:54|1:50:3|Before he could finish his sentence, he was struck hard from behind. [Cao Shaolin] turned around and saw an old man with white hair holding a hoe. He threw the gun over and said.
1:50:5|1:50:25|Unexpectedly, at this moment, [Cao Shaolin] was fiercely struck from behind. He turned around to see a sickle inserted into his back. Immediately after, a middle-aged man approached and stabbed a dagger directly into his abdomen, then smiled and stepped back. At this moment, all the people in the ancient city roared in anger and ran towards [Cao Shaolin].
1:50:25|1:50:42|Everyone picked up their only weapons and vented their anger towards [Cao Shaolin]. Like a dog that had lost its home, [Cao Shaolin] was punched and kicked, gradually being engulfed in the crowd. Captain [Yang Kenan], who saw this scene on the rooftop, finally felt relieved. His exhausted body involuntarily fell backwards.
1:50:42|1:50:52|At this moment, in the backyard littered with broken wine barrels, [Ma Feng] is searching for [Zhang Yi]'s figure. As he moves aside a thick half of a broken barrel, [Zhang Yi]'s pale face emerges from the rubble.
1:51:21|1:51:30|In memory, [Zhang Yi] peeled an egg, smiled, then sighed deeply and said to [Ma Feng].
1:51:36|1:51:40|In his memories, the charming smile of [Zhang Yi] always appeared in [Ma Feng]'s mind.
1:51:41|1:51:54|Now, a living person is lying in front of him, unconscious. Tears fell from [Ma Feng]'s eyes uncontrollably. The years of friendship within the sect have now turned into this scene, and he himself does not know whether what he has done is right or wrong.
1:51:54|1:52:3|However, it can be seen that in the future, they eventually went in different directions. After a while, [Ma Feng] dragged his heavy footsteps onto the street.
1:52:3|1:52:11|At this moment, [Yang Kenan] was sitting on the steps holding his wife who had been shot. As he approached, he saw [Cao Shaolin] lying on the ground, covered in blood, already lifeless.
1:52:12|1:52:28|He slowly bent down, sat beside [Yang Kenan], and looked up. The people around, as if still not relieved, glared angrily at the body of [Cao Shaolin]. Some soldiers, with red eyes, wanted to go see the young marshal, but were firmly suppressed by the people behind them. [Yang Kenan] turned and said.
1:52:29|1:52:38|[Ma Feng] looked at [Yang Kenan] and said. He then turned to the people standing around and continued speaking.
1:52:40|1:52:57|Upon hearing this, the wife in his arms looked up at [Yang Kenan], who was radiating the light of justice at that moment. [Yang Kenan] sat there with a swollen face, looking at the body of [Cao Shaolin] on the ground. At this point, he was still muttering about being the son of Cao Ying, a murderer, but in reality, he was just a poor child who had been indoctrinated with evil beliefs since childhood.
1:52:57|1:53:16|The saying goes that pitiful people are often hateful. Think about the teacher and children who died unjustly in Shitoucheng, the innocent people slaughtered in Pucheng. Perhaps only his death can provide solace to those persecuted souls. In the scene, a group of soldiers in military uniforms enter Pucheng.
1:53:26|1:53:33|On the distant mountain top, the family of [Yang Kenan] looked at the cheers of victory coming from Pucheng. Standing beside them, [Ma Feng] lowered his head and said.
1:54:16|1:54:23|After a brief farewell, [Ma Feng] turned and walked towards Taiping. He watched as [Ma Feng] walked further and further away.
