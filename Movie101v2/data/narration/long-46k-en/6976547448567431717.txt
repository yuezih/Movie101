0:3:19|0:3:29|Zhang Dazui, with eyes full of love for the broken guitar band and rock music. The lead singer, seeing the excited Hu Liang in the crowd, comfortingly throws the broken guitar band's nameplate into Hu Liang's hands.
0:3:30|0:3:38|With the band's popularity soaring, the Jilin Province Jilin City Rock Star City Sculpture Project organized by the local government officially kicked off with the participation of the Broken Guitar Band and numerous media outlets.
0:4:6|0:4:22|With the project starting, a large amount of materials were transported to the square, with a large number of manpower and resources invested. What was originally a barren square was quickly covered with floor tiles, and the surrounding vegetation also flourished. As time passed day by day, a guitar sculpture several tens of meters high rose from the ground.
0:4:22|0:4:40|The title of the film "The Sewing Machine Band" then appeared on the screen in a very hardcore manner. Back in 2017, manager Cheng Gong took the delivery and headed towards the training room. At that moment, the band of three, unaware of Cheng Gong's arrival, was singing rock in the training room.
0:5:26|0:5:32|Upon seeing [Cheng Gong] push the door open, the three of them stopped singing abruptly.
0:5:35|0:5:42|After listening, the three of them stood there holding guitars, looking at each other in confusion. Then, [Cheng Gong] sat on the sofa and played a video for the three of them.
0:5:44|0:5:58|The lead singer and guitarist listened to the accompaniment, dancing listlessly with a sullen face. The drummer, with a defiant look on his face, stood still with his head down, unwilling to even lift his hands. [Cheng Gong] looked at the three extremely perfunctory people in front of him, paused the music impatiently, and threw his phone on the table.
0:6:0|0:6:7|He leaned back on the sofa, looking disappointedly at the three people, when the drummer spoke.
0:6:35|0:6:48|He picked up the lollipop next to him and tore it open forcefully. The lollipop fell to the ground as if it was against him, but he didn't mind, wiped off the dirt, and stuffed it into his mouth as he said.
0:7:2|0:7:17|Later, [Cheng Gong] pushed open the door of the hospital ward with three people holding flowers and fruit baskets, smiling. However, they found it empty inside. Then, [Cheng Gong] opened the letters left by Manager Fan on the table.
0:8:31|0:8:44|As the warehouse door opened, colorful long johns spilled out. Manager Ding casually took out a pair of long johns with the word "open eyes" on the buttocks and a glasses pattern on the crotch. After a few laughs, they carried boxes of long johns back home.
0:8:44|0:8:57|At night, penniless Cheng Gong searched in the room filled with autumn pants for high-interest loans. Suddenly, an email popped up in Cheng Gong's mailbox, begging for cooperation. When he opened it, Hu Liang appeared holding a guitar and singing.
0:9:29|0:9:43|[Cheng Gong] angrily slammed the computer shut and cursed. Then, not taking it seriously, [Cheng Gong] went to the kitchen to cook instant noodles, wearing the very comical long johns left by [Manager Ding] on his legs. Suddenly, his phone vibrated, [Cheng Gong] hesitated for a moment, and answered the call.
0:10:50|0:10:59|The day after receiving the deposit, [Cheng Gong] boarded the train to Jilin, and the weather was as bright as his mood.
0:10:59|0:11:11|After a long journey of several hours, they finally arrived in Jianshi City. Getting off the car, [Cheng Gong] walked through the crowd with a bewildered look, dragging his suitcase. At a glance, he saw the conspicuous pick-up sign with sunflowers stuck on it.
0:11:18|0:11:23|Suddenly, a children's band started playing enthusiastically.
0:11:26|0:11:39|At the command of Hu Liang, two elementary school students, one holding a flower wreath and the other holding a bouquet, walked up to Cheng Gong. Seeing such a grand scene, the surrounding crowd took out their phones and gathered around. Cheng Gong awkwardly cooperated with everyone, and then Hu Liang hugged Cheng Gong.
0:12:35|0:12:41|[Cheng Gong] looked at the messy hut and hesitated to enter.
0:13:39|0:13:45|Through the large guitar sculpture poster, the camera moves to the rock park with a giant guitar standing tall.
0:13:53|0:13:59|Cheng Gong glanced at Hu Liang's necklace.
0:14:50|0:14:57|Cheng Gong looked disdainful and ignored him, then said.
0:15:22|0:15:37|Hu Liang, who hadn't adjusted the angle yet, was attracted by the singing. At this moment, two knights in full armor riding motorcycles passed by in the distance. Hu Liang stared intently. At this time, Cheng Gong, who was still swinging his arms in place, asked.
0:15:39|0:15:48|[Cheng Gong] turned around and found that [Hu Liang] was actually taking photos for the motorcyclists. Later, the two riders also kindly took a group photo with [Cheng Gong] and [Hu Liang].
0:15:50|0:15:55|At night, after [Hu Liang] finished admiring the group photo while lying on the bed, he turned around with a mischievous smile and looked ambiguously at [Cheng Gong].
0:16:55|0:17:7|In a hurry to chase someone, Hu Liang slipped and rolled from the doorway to the bend in the middle of the stairs. Cheng Gong, seeing this, dropped his bag and hurried to Hu Liang's side. As he saw him faint on the ground and was about to approach, Hu Liang opened his eyes with a mischievous smile.
0:17:12|0:17:18|Hu Liang tried to grab Cheng Gong's leg, but ended up facing down and sliding from the middle of the stairs to the ground.
0:17:20|0:17:27|After speaking, Cheng Gong walked past him mercilessly. Just as he was about to go down the stairs, his ankle was grabbed, and Cheng Gong impatiently struggled and asked.
0:17:49|0:17:55|Upon hearing that they needed to pay more, [Cheng Gong] set down the backpack containing the mobile phone.
0:18:30|0:18:42|The audition officially begins, and [Hu Liang] sets up over a hundred chairs on the flat ground, but only three people show up. There is a delicate-looking girl leaning on a crutch, a cocky young man, and an ordinary middle-aged man.
0:19:7|0:19:15|[Ding Jianguo] gave the two a disdainful look, then the man beside him introduced.
0:20:31|0:20:37|With that, he lifted his leg onto the armrest to block the way.
0:20:57|0:21:14|At this moment, music teacher [Qiao Dashan] and his daughter [Xi Xi] were hiding in a warehouse at the school, playing the piano. The two of them were completely immersed in the music, with the sunlight shining warmly on their faces through the blurry glass. Suddenly, a knocking on the door interrupted them.
0:21:59|0:22:3|As soon as the words fell, a footprint was left on the iron door of the residence.
0:22:4|0:22:17|Seeing another footprint, [Qiao Dashan] hurriedly ran to the corner. Then, the iron gate was kicked open, and a short-haired woman in a Taoist robe stood at the doorway. Upon seeing his wife, [Qiao Dashan] immediately knelt down on the ground.
0:22:22|0:22:30|Seeing [Xi Xi]'s mother with a strong presence at the door, [Cheng Gong] timidly took a few steps back. At this moment, [Hu Liang] spoke. Shortly after, he and [Qiao Dashan] knelt down together.
0:23:15|0:23:24|[Xi Xi]'s mother suddenly turned to look at the two men, [Qiao Dashan] and [Hu Liang] immediately raised the dumbbells in their hands, kneeling straight. Then, they turned back and spoke to [Xi Xi].
0:23:25|0:23:44|After patting [Xi Xi] on the back, he immediately stood up, exerted a little force on his heel, and the chair violently smashed towards [Hu Liang]. Just as everyone was still in a daze, another kick swept over [Xi Xi]'s head, and she used her heel to smash the electronic piano on the shelf.
0:23:46|0:23:56|With a loud shout from [Xi Xi]'s mother, the electronic piano was split in half and fell to the ground. The three big men were trembling at this moment, and [Xi Xi]'s mother turned around, looking at [Cheng Gong] with sharp eyes.
0:23:58|0:24:5|[Cheng Gong] knelt on the keyboard split in half immediately after locking eyes with him for a second. Later, the two of them arrived at a gynecological hospital.
0:24:33|0:24:38|After hearing the nurse call out the name, a middle-aged woman raised her hand and walked in. After work, [Yang Shuangshu] played with his grandson while wearing a mask.
0:24:47|0:24:51|[Yang Shuangshu] took off his mask upon hearing this, and said solemnly.
0:25:8|0:25:15|[Yang Shuangshu] took a sip of water, slowly put down the cup, and said with great emphasis.
0:25:43|0:25:49|Yang Shuangshu, who had just taken a sip of water, sprayed it out, and at this moment, Cheng Gong spoke again.
0:26:15|0:26:21|After hearing such a realistic answer, [Hu Liang] looked at [Yang Shuangshu] in disbelief. Then, he stood up excitedly.
0:26:38|0:26:48|Shortly after, [Yang Shuangshu] pulled open a drawer and pressed a button. The moment the button was pressed, the doors and windows in the room closed instantly.
0:26:49|0:27:3|Before [Cheng Gong] could finish speaking, the hidden sound system in the medicine cabinet suddenly appeared, with the light above shining vertically on [Yang Shuangshu], who looked disdainful. At this moment, the sign that originally read "Women's Friend" also changed to "Guitar Emperor", and the hospital room behind [Yang Shuangshu] also underwent a transformation.
0:27:3|0:27:18|The hospital bed and cabinet were replaced by musical instruments, and [Yang Shuangshu] began to play the instruments.
0:27:34|0:27:41|At this moment, a voice came from the phone in [Hu Liang]'s hand.
0:30:11|0:30:17|At this moment, [Yang Shuangshu] opens another box. [Hu Liang] stops and looks towards the guitar, then asks in surprise.
0:30:19|0:30:25|[Yang Shuangshu] took out a handkerchief to wipe the guitar, ignoring [Hu Liang].
0:30:57|0:31:3|At this moment, Hu Liang looked at Zha Yao sitting with his back against the wall and said.
0:32:1|0:32:4|Listen, [Zha Yao] rolled up his sleeves and got serious.
0:32:15|0:32:21|At this moment, Ding Jianguo, who heard the drumming, spontaneously joined in.
0:32:31|0:32:38|[Xi Xi] followed suit and started playing along with the rhythm. Little did anyone expect that as a primary school student, [Xi Xi] could play so well.
0:32:46|0:33:20|As the guitar emperor [Yang Shuangshu] naturally joined in. Just now, the lead singer [Hu Liang] who had just been disdainful of everyone, stood there with a big mouth in surprise, then recovered and exchanged a smile with the equally surprised [Cheng Gong]. At this moment, [Sun Dali] walked in shouting.
0:34:9|0:34:23|The impatient crowd interrupted Sun Dali with music. At this moment, Zhang Facai in the car was peeping at Ding Jianguo with binoculars.
0:36:6|0:36:12|After hearing this, [Zhang Facai] said in confusion.
0:36:22|0:36:30|Upon hearing this, he quickly picked up the binoculars and looked into the house. At that moment, inside the house, [Hu Liang] and [Ding Jianguo] were exchanging flirtatious glances.
0:36:32|0:36:39|Ignoring the money in his hands, [Zhang Facai] glanced at the two men with dissatisfaction, looking at the well-built [Hu Liang], and speculated.
0:36:57|0:37:14|Beside him, [Qiao Dashan] said. Then, [Xi Xi]'s mother walked away with a satisfied look on her face. [Qiao Dashan] looked at the sleeping figure, gently closed the door, and at that moment, a figure behind the curtain appeared faintly. As the curtain was slowly lifted, [Xi Xi] emerged.
0:37:14|0:37:23|The real [Xi Xi] looked towards the door, cautiously confirming, and after seeing the closed door, she walked to the bed and pulled up her stunt double, then walked out.
0:37:24|0:37:32|Yang Shuangshu, who was just handed the stunt double on the fire truck ladder, said. It turns out that the person on the bed is not Xi Xi, but Yang Shuangshu's grandson.
0:39:11|0:39:18|No one else made a move, only [Cheng Gong] clapped in response. Seeing the awkward situation, [Cheng Gong] raised his hand to signal him to start singing.
0:39:59|0:40:13|Seeing no one speaking, [Cheng Gong] turned to [Ding Jianguo]. After listening, [Cheng Gong] lowered his head in frustration and looked at [Hu Liang] with a helpless expression.
0:40:23|0:40:29|Calm down, [Cheng Gong] returned and wrote a song on the blackboard, saying to everyone.
0:40:36|0:40:38|[Hu Liang] squinted his eyes, playing the instrument while watching.
0:40:48|0:40:56|Soon, everyone was ready.
0:43:36|0:43:48|After the successful rehearsal in the base, this song began to be performed in various places in the city.
0:44:56|0:45:7|After three rounds of drinks, everyone was happily chatting and laughing on the rooftop. But Cheng Gong was drinking alone in silence. Ding Jianguo noticed and limped over with a bottle of wine, asking.
0:45:29|0:45:34|[Cheng Gong] took a deep breath and said.
0:46:48|0:46:54|Finishing speaking, [Ding Jianguo] made a self-deprecating scissor gesture, [Ding Jianguo] lowered his head after hearing it, and then asked again after a moment.
0:47:26|0:47:36|Cheng Gong looked at the brightly lit city and took a big sip of his drink. Then, a hand slowly rested on his shoulder. Thinking it was Ding Jianguo embracing him, he caressed the hand on his shoulder.
0:47:36|0:47:47|After exchanging a smile, [Ding Jianguo] reached out and tousled his hair, causing [Cheng Gong] to realize something was wrong. [Hu Liang] made a hushing gesture and tearfully said.
0:48:4|0:48:13|[Hu Liang] raised his glass high, proudly applauded, and the others walked away disdainfully after listening. Then, they officially confirmed the name of the band as the Sewing Machine Band.
0:48:25|0:48:34|With several people shouting in unison, the team's cohesion grew stronger. The next morning, real estate manager [Manager Ding] rode a tricycle to the home of the nail household, Old Deng.
0:49:19|0:49:34|Nail-house owner Lao Deng stood at the gate of the courtyard, holding a shovel and facing the demolition team with a resolute attitude. Many workers and excavators helplessly stopped outside the courtyard. At this moment, accompanied by the sound of tricycles, Manager Ding arrived in front of Lao Deng. Lao Deng still maintained a look of facing death with equanimity, looking at Manager Ding.
0:49:34|0:49:38|[Manager Ding] approached with clasped hands and said.
0:49:42|0:49:50|After A Jun finished speaking, he lifted the white cloth covering the back of the tricycle.
0:50:49|0:50:56|A Jun and Zhang Facai watched the limousine full of beautiful women drive away, and then A Jun told Zhang Facai.
0:51:5|0:51:17|[A Jun] glanced at the dumbfounded [Zhang Facai] in front of him, then counted the money he had just exchanged for intelligence. At that moment, [A Shuai] walked over with blood all over his face. [A Shuai] closed the car door and spoke to the two of them.
0:54:36|0:54:41|Facai pointed at the noodles in [A Jun]'s hand and said.
0:55:12|0:55:18|[Cheng Gong] looked at [Hu Liang] anxiously, gesturing for him to speak first. The dejected [Hu Liang], looking at [Xi Xi] who was very different from what he had imagined, began to speak incoherently.
0:55:33|0:55:37|At this moment, the director outside the studio answered the phone. Inside the studio, [Zha Yao] introduced.
0:55:51|0:55:59|Suddenly, fully armed special police rushed in and surrounded everyone. The three people in the car listening to the broadcast chuckled. [Cheng Gong] quickly turned off the live broadcast.
0:56:4|0:56:9|Zha Yao, who wanted to rebel, was immediately stunned by an electric baton. After the investigation, Zha Yao was shirtless.
0:56:31|0:56:36|After coming out of the radio station, everyone in the car comforted [Zha Yao].
0:56:50|0:57:1|Later, they recalled their story at the tattoo shop. In the shop, [Zha Yao] gazed affectionately at [Li Meiyan], who took out a tattoo design and confirmed it with him.
0:57:10|0:57:16|After listening, [Li Meiyan] put down the pattern in her hand, looked at [Zha Yao] in front of her, hesitated for a while, and said softly.
0:57:20|0:57:26|After finishing the tattoo, [Zha Yao] looked in the mirror, and [Li Meiyan] mischievously tattooed the words "I love [Li Meiyan]" on his back. Upon seeing this, [Zha Yao] said.
0:57:55|0:58:1|Zha Yao was so sure because he saw a photo of Li Meiyan and a big guitar on the wall while getting a tattoo.
0:58:55|0:59:3|Xi Xi walked in crying and sat on the sofa. Yang Shuangshu, who was wiping his precious guitar on the side, picked up some snacks and walked over to ask.
0:59:28|0:59:35|After seeing [Yang Shuangshu] walk away, [Hu Liang] and [Ding Jianguo] exchanged a smile. They then secretly took [Yang Shuangshu]'s precious guitar to the second floor.
1:1:42|1:1:50|Zhang Facai, who broke free, limped into the house.
1:2:5|1:2:8|[A Jun] kicked the door open and the two swaggered in.
1:2:28|1:2:37|At this moment, backstage of the school performance, [Cheng Gong] anxiously calls [Hu Liang]. Suddenly, [A Jun] picks up the phone that [Hu Liang] left in the living room and casually throws it into the fish tank.
1:2:37|1:2:48|Shortly after, [A Jun] looked at the clothes on the bed, a mischievous idea emerging in his mind. One by one, [Hu Liang]'s clothes floated out of the window. [A Jun] didn't even leave a single piece of underwear behind.
1:2:50|1:3:4|All thrown downstairs. After taking a shower, [Hu Liang] was ready to push open the door to go out, but unexpectedly, after [A Jun] threw the clothes, he also blocked the refrigerator at the bathroom door. [Hu Liang] used all his strength to push open the door and found that his room had been ransacked. Outside the window, a van's trunk was holding his clothes, and he shouted.
1:3:8|1:3:15|On the other side, at the school, [Cheng Gong] said to [Ding Jianguo]. [Ding Jianguo] was encouraged by [Cheng Gong].
1:3:20|1:3:30|After saying that, he turned and left. Back at home, [Hu Liang], who had no clothes to wear, remembered that he had a performance today. So he held a tire in front of his private parts with both hands and kicked the landlord's door with his foot.
1:3:32|1:3:38|After the landlady opened the door, she saw [Hu Liang] standing there naked, and said in confusion.
1:3:58|1:4:2|Applause erupted from the audience below the stage. The temporary lead singer, [Ding Jianguo], took a deep breath and looked at [Cheng Gong], exchanging a glance with him.
1:5:25|1:5:31|Under the gaze of the crowd, [Cheng Gong] threw down his bicycle, jogged forward, took the microphone, and addressed the students below.
1:5:41|1:5:58|After the fantasy ended, [Hu Liang] flicked his hair and confidently rode his bicycle towards the stage. Just as he had imagined, under the attention of many students and teachers, he successfully rushed onto the stage. The front wheel of the bicycle was lifted high, but because [Hu Liang] was too heavy, he flew off the bicycle halfway through.
1:5:58|1:6:11|Hu Liang fell heavily on the stage, and due to inertia, both he and the car continued to slide forward on the stage after falling. They knocked over all the equipment on the stage. Cheng Gong, seeing this, quickly ran onto the stage and anxiously addressed the teachers and students below.
1:7:3|1:7:10|After learning about their growing reputation, the band members became much happier washing cars at the repair shop. The old fire truck was also graffitied by them to look very cool.
1:7:26|1:7:34|Hu Liang, who suddenly realized, had tears welling up in his eyes.
1:7:37|1:7:49|[Hu Liang] listened, dropped the cloth in his hand, didn't even wipe off the foam on his hands, and excitedly hugged [Cheng Gong]. Everyone watching this scene also smiled happily for [Hu Liang], and [Cheng Gong] couldn't hide his joy either, smiling and hugging [Hu Liang].
1:7:49|1:8:5|[Ding Jianguo] looked upstairs and smiled at [Cheng Gong]. In the evening, several adults were drinking under a big guitar. [Yang Shuangshu] leaned against a sculpture and confided in the already tipsy crowd.
1:8:32|1:8:48|[Hu Liang] and a few others were already drunk, sitting on the ground with flushed faces, sharing their innermost thoughts. [Cheng Gong] walked over to [Ding Jianguo], who was sitting on the steps hugging a guitar, holding a bottle of wine. When [Ding Jianguo] looked up and saw [Cheng Gong], the two men smiled at each other in recognition.
1:9:2|1:9:18|[Ding Jianguo] thought for a moment and then placed the guitar on his lap. After putting it down, he picked up [Cheng Gong]'s uninjured hand and placed it on the guitar strings. He then moved closer to [Cheng Gong] and placed his own hand on the guitar fretboard. [Cheng Gong] smiled and tried to start playing.
1:10:17|1:10:43|[Ding Jianguo] is like the hand of [Cheng Gong], the two of them cooperate tacitly and complete a simple melody. [Ding Jianguo] also opens up the long-standing knot in [Cheng Gong]'s heart. As the short tune ends, the two of them gaze deeply at each other. After a long moment of eye contact,
1:10:43|1:11:1|[Ding Jianguo] took the initiative to kiss [Cheng Gong], then shyly ran away. This sudden kiss, in [Cheng Gong]'s imagination, was unexpected. After glancing back at the limping [Ding Jianguo], [Cheng Gong] turned back with a smile of happiness on his face. The sky was getting darker and darker.
1:11:1|1:11:21|A few people staggered back home, and early the next morning, Cheng Gong was still immersed in the happiness of love. Whistling, he returned to the repair shop from outside. Just as he took a few steps inside, a luxury car also drove into the workshop. The back seat of the luxury car happened to stop next to him, and the window slowly rolled down.
1:11:23|1:11:29|After speaking, he raised the car window again. [Cheng Gong] stared at the scene in front of him, and then the two arrived at a teahouse.
1:12:1|1:12:7|Finishing his words, he took out a bank card and placed it in front of [Cheng Gong]. [Cheng Gong] looked at the bank card on the table, feeling at a loss as he asked.
1:12:43|1:12:52|[Cheng Gong] lowered his head after listening, glanced at the bank card on the table, organized his words, and then said.
1:13:54|1:14:6|After chatting with [Ding Jianguo]'s father, [Cheng Gong] went to the rock park alone. He leaned against the fence and lit a cigarette, quietly watching the large guitar sculpture. His mind was filled with various thoughts, pondering the words spoken by [Manager Ding].
1:14:53|1:15:2|Having experienced the gap between ideal and reality himself, [Cheng Gong] eventually compromised. That night, after gathering the band together, he announced that the performance was canceled.
1:15:16|1:15:29|After hearing the news, everyone fell silent with a sense of despair, and a suppressed atmosphere filled the repair shop. No one wanted to speak. [Hu Liang], with tears in his eyes, unwillingly said, "I can't believe it."
1:15:31|1:15:49|Sitting silently on the stairs, [Ding Jianguo] seemed to have guessed the reason, staring at [Cheng Gong] intently. When he got home that night, [Ding Jianguo] used a slingshot to shatter the glass in [Cheng Gong]'s room. [Cheng Gong] opened the window and looked down at [Ding Jianguo] with a bewildered expression.
1:15:49|1:16:5|While [Ding Jianguo] looked on with a deadpan expression, [Cheng Gong] glanced over at a taxi nearby at her signal. They arrived at a construction site on the outskirts of Jiansan, where dozens of workers and large machines worked around the clock.
1:16:5|1:16:21|Accompanied by the roar of machinery, people toiled away, digging deep into the foundation. There was little communication among them as they worked under the glare of floodlights. At this moment, [Ding Jianguo] and [Cheng Gong] slowly pulled up in a taxi by the construction site. After getting out of the taxi, [Ding Jianguo] walked straight towards the edge of the foundation.
1:16:21|1:16:32|After getting off the car, [Cheng Gong] looked around in astonishment, jogging to catch up with [Ding Jianguo]. [Ding Jianguo] remained silent as he looked at the excavator in the deep pit. After another round of inspection, [Cheng Gong] asked in confusion.
1:16:36|1:16:42|Jianguo raised his head and gestured for [Cheng Gong] to look at the person operating the excavator. To Cheng Gong's surprise, it turned out to be Hu Liang.
1:17:4|1:17:16|After saying that, [Cheng Gong] looked disappointedly at Cheng Gong and then got into a taxi. [Cheng Gong] watched the taxi leave, wanting to say something but not knowing how to say it.
1:17:16|1:17:34|Suddenly, there was a loud noise in the sky, as if it struck directly at Cheng Gong's heart. Cheng Gong looked up at the sky, then down at Hu Liang inside the excavator, feeling full of guilt. At this moment, Lao Sun called Cheng Gong. Lao Sun told Cheng Gong the news that the big guitar had been dismantled overnight.
1:17:36|1:17:52|Upon learning the news, [Cheng Gong]'s face also instantly turned serious. He ran through the heavy rain from the construction site all the way to the rock park. The once magnificent giant guitar sculpture here, constantly being gnawed at by a large drilling machine, was now in ruins, with debris falling to the ground incessantly.
1:17:52|1:18:3|The guitar strings of [Cheng Gong] broke, leaning against the resonator, with only a few unbroken steel bars inside the hard cement supporting it. Standing on the ground, the thick base was also being slowly destroyed.
1:18:3|1:18:18|At this moment, Hu Liang, who had received the news, ran from the construction site in the rain and stood beside Cheng Gong, looking at the scene in front of him with a heart as cold as ashes. Hu Liang had given everything for the guitar, and now he stood in front of the dilapidated sculpture, looking helpless like a child.
1:18:38|1:18:42|[Hu Liang] ran to the drilling rig in tears, hitting it while saying.
1:19:3|1:19:7|Although all three of them were equally upset, they still sensibly dragged the emotionally charged [Hu Liang] back.
1:19:8|1:19:34|[Hu Liang] still wanted to rush forward, trying to save the big guitar in an unrealistic way. The pouring rain mixed with tears washed over them, [Cheng Gong], already soaked, looked at the tearful [Hu Liang], filled with self-blame and sadness rushing to his heart, he ran forward and shouted at [Hu Liang].
1:19:44|1:19:52|After listening, [Hu Liang] gradually calmed down and asked.
1:19:56|1:20:15|[Cheng Gong]'s words hit [Hu Liang] like a sharp thunder, striking deep into his heart. Unable to accept it, [Hu Liang] stood there in a daze, at a loss. Disappointed, everyone looked at [Cheng Gong], and at that moment, [Hu Liang] walked over and punched [Cheng Gong] to the ground.
1:20:16|1:20:25|[Cheng Gong] lay on the ground, allowing himself to be manipulated, and said to the three people holding [Hu Liang].
1:20:27|1:20:42|[Cheng Gong] tried to compensate [Hu Liang] in this way, seeking a little peace in his own heart. [Hu Liang], who was riding on [Cheng Gong], broke free from the crowd and glared at him furiously. Then, with a loud shout, he exerted all his strength and heavily smashed his raised fist on the ground next to [Cheng Gong].
1:20:42|1:20:52|His fist, filled with resentment and disappointment, came crashing down, severing the friendship between the two. Afterwards, [Hu Liang] slowly got up, leaving [Cheng Gong] lying on the ground.
1:20:52|1:21:2|The fierce rain mercilessly poured on Cheng Gong's face, making it impossible for him to open his eyes. This band, with a huge age span, came together with extremely harmonious music and a love for rock.
1:21:2|1:21:18|Cheng Gong's bright future was ruined by his own hands. As Cheng Gong lay on the ground, he recalled everything that had happened in the past few days, filled with regret. After getting up, Hu Liang took a deep breath to calm himself down. Then, dragging his soaking wet clothes, he walked aimlessly towards the ruins.
1:21:18|1:21:35|Upon reaching the edge of the ruins, [Hu Liang] slowly squatted down, laboriously lifted a piece of wreckage from a large guitar, panting heavily, and walked forward without looking back. Meanwhile, [Cheng Gong] lay motionless on the ground, unable to forgive himself. On this night, the band, which could be considered a miracle, disbanded.
1:21:35|1:21:50|In the afternoon of the next day, [Cheng Gong] bought a train ticket back to Beijing, ready to leave. After packing up his luggage and preparing to leave, he hesitated and looked back at the small house that was once full of disdain. He then looked at the photo taken with [Hu Liang] in front of the big guitar when they first arrived in Jiansan.
1:21:50|1:22:2|When he left with his luggage, there were three thick stacks of cash left on the table as compensation for [Hu Liang]. As the sun set, [Cheng Gong] stood in the train aisle, watching the scenery rapidly receding behind him, lost in thought.
1:22:2|1:22:15|After a long night of driving, the next day, Cheng Gong arrived in Beijing. Upon his return, he hurried to the rehearsal room of the band. He lowered his head and touched the thick dust on the drum set, looking at the desolate rehearsal room.
1:22:15|1:22:23|The mood became even heavier. When he got home at night, [Cheng Gong] opened his computer and found an email from [Hu Liang] in the midst of loan advertisements in his inbox.
1:22:23|1:22:35|In the video, the once silly Hu Liang gradually welled up with tears, filled with apologies and longing, lost in thought. On the other side, in Jilin, Hu Liang experienced these things.
1:22:35|1:22:47|Returning to the past life, covered in oil and dust, lying on a skateboard, struggling to twist screws under the car. When unable to twist, lying on the skateboard, tilting the head to look at the guitar leaning against the wall.
1:22:47|1:23:4|After watching it, his expression relaxed significantly, as if the guitar could give him a continuous stream of strength. In the rock park, the large guitar still retained the appearance from the heavy rain that day, looking particularly spectacular under the setting sun. Meanwhile, at school, [Xi Xi], under the pressure from her mother, reluctantly gave up her rock dream.
1:23:4|1:23:13|Studying the knowledge about atomic bombs earnestly at the desk. Ding Jianguo, who has experienced betrayal, has also changed his style from the past and put on a mature suit.
1:23:15|1:23:31|She accepted the position of vice president, sitting in the conference room, but [Ding Jianguo]'s changes only stayed on the surface. Her rock-loving heart never changed, and she played the guitar in the conference room without distraction. After the band disbanded, [Zha Yao] still did not give up on her original intention of coming to Jiansan, but instead confidently drummed in the crowded streets.
1:23:31|1:23:46|As a diligent apprentice, Old Sun followed closely behind, holding high the flag of finding [Zha Yao]'s true love. Not long after the big guitar was dismantled, [Yang Shuangshu]'s daughter also learned about his band reformation. At the clinic, she discovered the secret base filled with guitars drawn by [Yang Shuangshu].
1:23:54|1:24:16|After saying that, he sadly tilted his head to one side. Back in Beijing, [Cheng Gong] missed them every moment, sitting on the sofa in the training room, bowing his head, recalling the past few days, and not sleeping all night. The next day, [Cheng Gong] sent the Asian Wisdom Art Troupe that transformed into little fresh meat, and the three of them went to the airport.
1:24:16|1:24:25|Their car moved slowly on the congested road, with honking coming from all directions. The taxi driver looked at the three flamboyantly dressed individuals and jokingly remarked.
1:24:44|1:24:46|While [Cheng Gong] sat in the passenger seat with a look of disappointment on his face.
1:24:46|1:25:5|At this moment, [Cheng Gong] faintly heard the song sung by the Sewing Machine Band. After searching around, he looked out the window and saw two motorcyclists at the time, playing their music through speakers. The flags displayed slogans promoting the band as they maneuvered agilely through the streets and alleys of various cities.
1:25:9|1:25:26|Upon hearing this song, [Cheng Gong]'s eyes lit up, and he got off the car with a completely different demeanor. At that moment, a motorcycle passed by in front of [Cheng Gong], who looked at the large sewing machine band on the flag, as well as the time and location of the concert. He stayed in place, recalling the words he once thought were lies when he told [Hu Liang] and the others, now vividly remembered.
1:25:26|1:25:40|Their appearance made [Cheng Gong] feel that in this world full of interests, there are also people who keep their verbal promises. At this moment, the rock 'n' roll heart in [Cheng Gong]'s soul was completely awakened, he widened his eyes, watching the direction the knights were leaving, even his breathing became rapid.
1:25:40|1:25:58|Later, he took a taxi alone and arrived in Jiansan that night. In the quiet Jiansan without the noisy sounds of the night, the taxi stopped steadily outside Hu Liang's repair shop. After paying the fare, Cheng Gong got out of the car and looked up at the sign of the repair shop, his emotions stirred and yet timid, unable to express.
1:25:58|1:26:15|Quietly watching for a while, [Cheng Gong] finally gathered up the courage to walk in. At that moment, [Hu Liang] was singing in the bathroom while taking a shower. [Cheng Gong] slowly pushed open the door and saw that the room, which had just been cleaned up, had become messy again. Clothes and shoes were randomly thrown on the dining table, and the floor was piled high with garbage.
1:26:15|1:26:18|At this moment, [Cheng Gong] looked up and noticed that the torn guitar band poster on the wall was removed by [Hu Liang].
1:26:20|1:26:34|[Cheng Gong] remained silent for a moment, then tilted his head to see a new shelf on the wall. On the shelf was the large guitar fragment that [Hu Liang] had picked up from the ruins in the rain, followed by a plaque underneath that boldly read "Rock is Dead".
1:26:34|1:26:46|[Cheng Gong] sighed, then squatted down to tidy up [Hu Liang]'s clothes. At that moment, [Hu Liang], who heard the noise, held a trash can in one hand and a toilet plunger in the other, and viciously slammed the trash can onto [Cheng Gong]'s head.
1:27:7|1:27:15|In the moment of taking off the trash can, [Hu Liang] seemed startled and took two steps back, looking at [Cheng Gong] who was almost knocked unconscious. He quickly threw away the plunger in his hand.
1:27:15|1:27:26|After tidying up, [Cheng Gong] lit three sticks of incense, bowed towards the memorial tablet, and placed them in the incense burner. Then he sat on the chair, looking at [Hu Liang] who was deliberately avoiding his gaze. The two remained silent for a long time, until [Cheng Gong] organized his words and spoke.
1:28:57|1:29:6|While speaking, he took out a wad of cash and threw it on the table.
1:29:21|1:29:38|Finishing speaking, [Cheng Gong] took out Hu Liang's necklace and continued. Hu Liang looked up at his faith hesitantly. Cheng Gong asked again. With moist eyes, Hu Liang took a deep breath and said.
1:29:54|1:30:6|The next day, the two of them, rejuvenated like newborns, energetically got on their fire truck. [Hu Liang] once again put on his necklace, they clapped hands and then went to visit other band members' homes separately. Meanwhile, on Manager Ding's side.
1:30:6|1:30:20|Cheng Gong's men handed him the card he had received at the time. At this moment, the Sewing Machine Band had no more constraints. After the rock-filled fire truck circled around Jianshi City, several people successively got on the car and continued to search enthusiastically on the car.
1:30:20|1:30:30|At the last stop, the bus stopped under the building of [Xi Xi], who was about to climb out of the window.
1:30:58|1:31:9|Upon finishing speaking, [Qiao Dashan] glared at [Xi Xi]'s mother who was nervously gasping for breath, while [Xi Xi]'s mother looked at him disdainfully, ready to confront him at any moment. Suddenly, [Qiao Dashan] pulled out a bank card from his hair.
1:31:12|1:31:18|[Xi Xi] quickly stepped forward to take the bank card from her mother, looked at it carefully, and then raised her eyes to ask.
1:31:19|1:31:32|Facing the questioning from [Xi Xi]'s mother, [Qiao Dashan] breathed heavily, then resolutely searched through his hair.
1:31:41|1:31:52|After speaking, he walked towards the car, and several people looked at [Xi Xi] walking out openly in disbelief. At this moment, the final piece of the puzzle from the band was also completed.
1:32:7|1:32:18|[Cheng Gong] looked a bit embarrassed at the group of people who showed no signs of nervousness. At that moment, as the car passed a corner, it was blocked by a van in front. Soon after, two more vans stopped at the rear, cutting off their retreat.
1:32:20|1:32:25|In an instant, a dozen thugs with sticks rushed out and blocked the fire truck. At this moment, [Zhang Facai] in the truck placed a bag of cash in front of the gang leader and said.
1:32:36|1:32:42|Putting on a horse mask that had been prepared in advance, [Cheng Gong] finished speaking.
1:33:32|1:33:40|With a command from [Zhang Facai], dozens of thugs swarmed in, and [Cheng Gong] immediately turned around to close the door of the fire truck. Then, the two of them began to face a beating from more than a dozen people.
1:33:40|1:33:47|[Hu Liang] took the lead, carrying a person with his strong physique and charging forward. The encirclement just now was also broken up by [Hu Liang].
1:33:47|1:34:3|Quick-witted [Cheng Gong] swiftly dove under the car as the enemy's baton swung towards him. Emerging from the other side, [Cheng Gong] evaded the enemy's gunfire and grabbed the water bag from the fire truck, using it like a belt to strike at the enemy. When [Hu Liang] couldn't hold off any longer, [Zha Yao] climbed onto the top of the fire truck and provided timely support with a high-pressure water gun.
1:34:3|1:34:13|In an instant, everyone was sprayed and scattered. On the other side of the car, Cheng Gong was still struggling with the water bag. Although the water bag had a long attack range, it did not gain a significant advantage against the siege of more than a dozen people.
1:34:13|1:34:20|[Zha Yao] saw the situation and quickly changed direction to spray towards the enemies near [Cheng Gong]. At this moment, [Hu Liang], who broke out of the encirclement, ran to the side of the car and opened the valve.
1:34:20|1:34:31|The water bag that was just deflated suddenly swelled up, spraying [Zhang Facai] who was close by into the air. While [Zhang Facai] was still groaning on the ground, [Hu Liang] ran to [Cheng Gong]'s side, and the two of them together controlled the high-pressure water gun.
1:34:31|1:34:40|Facing the two high-pressure water guns on the ground and above, the oncoming enemies were knocked down one by one. Just as they were fighting vigorously, an enemy quietly climbed up from behind [Zha Yao].
1:34:44|1:34:54|The huge impact caused [Zha Yao] to sit paralyzed on the roof of the car. As the thug swung the bat again, [Ding Jianguo] accurately struck and knocked down the enemy. The two under the car continued to spray with a water gun, but found that the water flow gradually weakened.
1:34:56|1:35:3|The two looked at the thugs lying on the ground wailing, dropped the water gun, and at this moment, [Ding Jianguo] found that the marbles in his briefcase had also been shot out.
1:35:3|1:35:13|[Zha Yao] sat helplessly on the roof of the car, suffering from serious injuries. At this moment, the henchmen who were knocked down by the water gun gradually regained consciousness and stood up from the ground. They watched as the few people who were out of ammunition and food rushed towards them again.
1:35:13|1:35:25|At the critical moment, [Xi Xi] opened the car door, [Yang Shuangshu] wearing sunglasses, holding a fire extinguisher, rushed towards the oncoming enemies. In an instant, the thick powder from the fire extinguisher enveloped everyone, making the thugs facing it unable to open their eyes.
1:35:26|1:35:35|[Cheng Gong] and [Hu Liang] seized the opportunity and rushed towards the thugs without hesitation. Everyone was beaten badly, and as they just recovered, they looked at the thick smoke and powder, unable to distinguish the two for a moment.
1:35:37|1:35:39|And at this moment, wearing a horse-faced mask and standing out, [Zhang Facai] became the target of the two.
1:35:40|1:35:47|[Cheng Gong] grabbed the long mask, while [Hu Liang] struck fiercely behind him. As the dust from the fire extinguisher gradually dispersed, [Zhang Facai] was also subdued by the two of them.
1:36:7|1:36:19|Just as [Hu Liang] was about to remove the mask, he was knocked down by [Zhang Facai]. [Cheng Gong] quickly sprayed the fire extinguisher at the oncoming thugs. Then, [Cheng Gong] untied the rope tied to a large number of iron barrels nearby.
1:36:20|1:36:27|The iron barrel rolled down, smashing towards the thugs, buying time for the band members to escape. However, the thugs who quickly regrouped also chased after them with all their might.
1:36:27|1:36:38|Several people ran for a while, but carrying guitars and a group of elderly and children, they couldn't run fast. Just as they were about to be caught up, they stopped. Two groups of people on horseback rushed out from both sides of the intersection ahead.
1:36:38|1:36:50|On the left rushing out are the demolition team led by [Ding Jianguo]'s father. On the right rushing out are the taekwondo team led by [Xi Xi]'s mother. At that time, [Zha Yao] and [Xi Xi] immediately called their parents from the car.
1:36:51|1:37:2|The two teams then turned the corner and converged on the road where [Cheng Gong] was located. The demolition team led by Manager [Ding] all wore sunglasses and suits, while the taekwondo team led by [Xi Xi]'s mother were all dressed in doboks.
1:37:2|1:37:10|The black and white teams rushed towards the enemies behind them. Passing by the band members, they didn't say a word and immediately engaged in a fight with the enemies.
1:38:2|1:38:19|With several people shouting in unison, a rock concert filled with passion is about to begin. Carrying large guitar cases, they climbed over the rubble of the guitars and reached the highest steps. They stood in their respective positions, staring blankly at the construction site below. The once crowded square now lay in ruins.
1:38:19|1:38:34|Several people looked at the empty audience below, feeling particularly sad. As the lead singer, [Hu Liang] still had blood stains on his face that hadn't been wiped clean. He lowered his head with a low mood, clenched his teeth, and breathed heavily. After adjusting for a while, he looked towards [Cheng Gong] behind the stage.
1:38:34|1:38:46|With a determined look in his eyes, [Cheng Gong] slowly raised his right arm and made a rock gesture towards [Hu Liang]. [Hu Liang] nodded in response. At that moment, words from his childhood echoed in [Hu Liang]'s ears.
1:38:57|1:39:4|Hu Liang then started playing music on the empty stage.
1:40:18|1:40:46|[Hu Liang] sang passionately with his eyes closed, memories of the band's journey from formation to the present flashing through his mind. They performed tirelessly at nursing homes, construction sites, and schools. In the car, they swayed their bodies to the music together, and played music in perfect harmony at the repair shop.
1:40:46|1:40:53|Excitedly embracing each other upon receiving the government performance invitation, drinking on the rooftop, standing side by side, shouting towards the city.
1:41:32|1:41:54|At this moment, the tightly secured factory gate kept swinging. As the gate was opened by the security guards, numerous Anle musicians and rock-loving citizens rushed in, carrying guitars and drum sets, shouting like crazy as they surged towards the stage. In just a few seconds, the empty land was filled to the brim.
1:41:55|1:41:59|In the excited atmosphere, the members of the Broken Guitar band also arrived at the scene on motorcycles.
1:44:43|1:44:58|As the people on stage began to accompany, all the guitarists and drummers below the stage lined up tacitly. Everyone played the same song together, and the audience without instruments instinctively stood at the back, opening their phone flashlights to show support.
1:44:58|1:45:21|Cheng Gong, who couldn't break through his own inner defense line, shook his head with tears in his eyes. But with the accompaniment of everyone's voices and Hu Liang's continuous encouragement, Cheng Gong roared and rushed onto the stage.
1:47:59|1:48:5|After a long time, [Xi Xi] recited the story of the band to everyone at school.
1:48:26|1:48:32|The day after the performance, several members of the band came to the train station to bid farewell to Cheng Gong.
1:48:46|1:48:55|When he reached the carriage, [Cheng Gong] turned back reluctantly and waved goodbye to everyone, looking at them with deep reluctance.
1:48:55|1:49:12|When preparing to step into the carriage, [Ding Jianguo] stood still in place, dressed in high heels and a long coat, holding a guitar and a suitcase, walking slowly towards [Cheng Gong], completely different from his usual style. Seeing such a ladylike [Ding Jianguo], [Cheng Gong] was surprised, staring wide-eyed and frozen in place.
1:49:12|1:49:18|Although his attire has changed, [Ding Jianguo] still maintains his cool personality, calmly watching [Cheng Gong].
1:49:27|1:49:39|After saying that, he threw down his luggage and walked into the carriage gracefully, [Cheng Gong] looked at the luggage and smiled at everyone. Remembering all this, [Xi Xi] with [Hu Liang]'s necklace continued her speech.
1:49:55|1:50:2|After everyone shouted, they stood up excitedly and danced. The rock spirit here, like the necklace on [Xi Xi], is passed down from generation to generation.
1:50:4|1:50:16|Although the big guitar was dismantled, after the exciting concert, the entire Ji'an City was filled with a strong rock atmosphere. In this city that loves rock music, even the shape of the school resembles a giant guitar.
1:50:16|1:50:22|As the school's exterior slowly unfolds, the film is about to say goodbye to you here. Thank you for listening.
1:50:23|1:50:28|At the end of the film, we will bring you a movie Easter egg and a special performance.
1:50:28|1:50:53|The hostess of Jiansan Elementary School is played by [Singing Legend] from the Knight Band, the leading doctor is played by [Liu Yijun] from the Tang Dynasty Band, the warehouse manager is played by [Long Long] from the 43 Baojia Street Band, the onlookers at Jiansan Train Station are played by [Gao Hu] from the Pain Band, the Harley female rider is played by [Xiao Nan] from the Cobra Band, and the spokesperson of Jiansan Nursing Home is played by [Lei Gang] from the Paradise Band.

1:51:18|1:51:24|The leader of the thugs is played by Xiao Wei from the band "Watchmen of the Wheat Field". It is worth noting that these people are all real members of the band and true rockers.
1:51:26|1:51:32|Next, let me introduce the post-credits scene. After the exciting performance that evening, several people were happily eating hot pot at the repair shop.
1:52:13|1:52:21|Later, recalling the encounter at the tattoo shop. When asked for a name, Tongtong looked down and saw the pleasant smell on [Zha Yao]'s fingers, mistaking it for another girl, and deliberately said.
