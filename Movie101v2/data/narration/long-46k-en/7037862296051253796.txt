0:0:50|0:1:5|Next, the hanging photos gradually rotate to the front, with the eyes of each person in the photos covered. Then, the photos form a circle.
0:1:54|0:2:12|Suddenly, the sturdy lines multiplied, and the single figure in the middle of the frame became two, then three people. They seemed to be having a conversation. Soon after, a high-voltage transmission tower appeared in the center of the frame, with numerous high-voltage lines hanging on both sides. One afternoon, at the outskirts of the icehouse.
0:2:12|0:2:21|The entrance was piled with abandoned wooden frames, and the walls outside the icehouse were painted white. Due to being constantly washed by rain, the original cement color was exposed.
0:2:22|0:2:40|Suddenly, two vans drove onto the bumpy road outside the icehouse. The people inside rested their arms on the windows, surveying the dilapidated buildings around them. The vans then turned onto a grass-covered path. Suddenly, a black sedan appeared at the entrance.
0:2:40|0:2:50|The man in the passenger seat was wearing a pair of black sunglasses and a Bluetooth earpiece on his ear. After glancing at the direction of the van, he focused his gaze on the screen in front of him.
0:2:51|0:3:2|At this moment, a group of men in the ice storage room stood on either side of the conveyor belt, watching the man in the middle counting money. On the other side, a henchman pushed aside the crushed ice and took out a white package.
0:3:3|0:3:13|One of them had a camera hidden in his belt, recording every move of everyone present. The man sitting in the car was watching the screen intently on the other end of the camera.
0:3:14|0:3:18|In the icehouse, a man's phone rings, and he slowly answers it.
0:3:22|0:3:35|A Shun immediately poured the white powder into the water tank and flushed it down the drain with water. A Gou, on the other hand, observed the expressions of everyone.
0:3:40|0:3:46|Li Cangdong's colleague next to him said anxiously. He stared at the person on the screen and suddenly frowned.
0:3:50|0:3:55|In the icehouse, undercover agent Xi Gui, after receiving the order, threw the bag filled with banknotes towards the opposite side, then immediately tackled and wrestled with them on the ground.
0:4:0|0:4:5|The sudden sound of gunshots made [Li Cangdong], who was sitting in front of the screen, tense. Then, a large number of people in bulletproof vests rushed towards the ice storage.
0:4:6|0:4:11|On the other side, the man hiding in the corner watched in panic as the undercover agent and the drug dealer fought each other.
0:4:12|0:4:19|Shortly after, the gun that the two were fighting for fell in front of him. Being timid, he cautiously peeked out and looked at the gun, while the undercover agent in danger spoke.
0:4:38|0:4:47|Fleeing [A Di] looked around in panic upon hearing the police's voices. Then, he immediately crawled under the machine, at which point a large number of police officers rushed in.
0:5:22|0:5:28|After speaking, he reached out to [Li Cangdong]. And [Li Cangdong] calmly took out an envelope. He looked at the envelope in his hand.
0:5:44|0:5:57|But he didn't listen at all, suddenly turned around and pointed at [Li Cangdong]. And [Li Cangdong] calmly looked at him and said.
0:6:0|0:6:17|Li Cangdong, who was slapped, looked guiltily at the man who slammed the door and walked out. The man hurriedly walked on the street, looking around vigilantly. Then, he held the backpack in his arms, but as he turned the corner, he suddenly stopped, his eyes filled with fear as he looked ahead.
0:6:17|0:6:33|On the other side, [A Di] is closely watched by two henchmen. Then, three henchmen emerge from the alley next to him. The man is so scared that he is dumbfounded, and then, after putting the fallen backpack back on his shoulder, he turns and runs into the alley next to him.
0:6:33|0:6:39|Due to the darkness, the man tripped over the storage baskets piled on both sides and fell to the ground.
0:6:40|0:6:44|In a panic, he grabbed the vegetable basket and quickly got up, without even looking at the backpack beside him, and ran off.
0:6:46|0:6:56|Suddenly, at the corner, [A Gou] caught up with quick steps, swinging his big knife towards the man. The man, who had been hit by several slashes, fled in all directions, and then he hid in a narrow crevice.
0:6:58|0:7:11|And in the darkness, with his arm bleeding profusely, he was still discovered. Then, the man started to step back one after another, and at this moment, [A Gou] rushed over upon the call of his companion, holding a knife tightly and pressing forward.
0:7:15|0:7:20|As the man fell to the ground, his companions behind him stepped forward and stabbed the knife into his leg.
0:7:30|0:7:41|He quickly stood up and crawled towards the nearby stairs. At this moment, he saw hope because at the end of the stairs on the right was the exit, so he lay on the iron railing and shouted loudly.
0:7:46|0:7:52|Desperately wanting to get out, he stretched half of his body outside through the crack.
0:8:0|0:8:18|[A Dog] unwillingly turned and left. At this moment, the man was slumped against the iron gate, his face twisted in a grimace, one hand gripping the iron bars. The other hand tightly held onto the iron pillar outside the door. On the other side, [Li Cangdong] sat on the edge of the bed in dim lighting. He bowed his head, deep in thought.
0:8:28|0:8:35|Next, [Li Cangdong] and his colleague appeared at the bar.
0:8:42|0:8:50|Before long, [Li Cangdong] who was leaning on the bar, slowly lifted his head and looked at the glass of wine.
0:8:58|0:9:14|Suddenly, his attention was drawn to a beautiful woman, who, sitting across from him, raised her glass in response after meeting his gaze. The ambiguous atmosphere of the bar enveloped the two as they exchanged glances, but [Li Cangdong] was only using alcohol to vent his inner frustration.
0:9:14|0:9:30|Soon after, the screen gradually showed a crisscross of iron wires, which intertwined to form the characters "line" and "person". A year later, in the middle of the towering buildings, the sunny sky shone through. Surprisingly, there wasn't a single cloud in the sky at that moment.
0:9:31|0:9:48|Shortly after, through the transparent glass door, [Li Cangdong] can be seen slowly climbing the stairs. He had a blank expression on his face, just like before, as he opened the door and walked in. Then, he pressed the doorbell on the wall and pushed open the glass door to enter. At that moment, the man at the front desk said.
0:11:8|0:11:15|At this moment, his gaze was vacant, but he spoke earnestly. On the other side, a car in the alley.
0:12:0|0:12:18|At night, the rain-soaked streets were wet, with shallow puddles reflecting the tall buildings. The elevator door opened, and [Li Cangdong] walked out, holding a stack of books in one hand and a briefcase in the other. He then walked straight towards a closed security door, unlocked it with a key, and walked in.
0:12:18|0:12:32|Following that, he casually turned on the lights in the room, walked towards the table in the middle, placed the stack of books in his hand down, and then walked towards the innermost part. He then stood in front of the table, holding a pot of boiling instant noodles, eating and busying himself at the same time.
0:12:43|0:13:0|The next day, on the sidewalk outside the Biwu Prison, a motorcycle and a car crossed paths. Then, the bald man stood in front of the gate, waiting for the prison guard to open it. The prison guard behind him escorted him inside.
0:13:0|0:13:7|The bald man walked straight ahead and, upon seeing [Li Cangdong] gesturing with his arm behind a pillar, glanced at the prison guard behind him. He stood in front of [Li Cangdong].
0:13:15|0:13:22|And as he looked towards the prison guard beside him, he immediately pulled out a cigarette. When he lit it up, [Li Cangdong]'s superior helped him light it.
0:13:24|0:13:31|After taking a deep drag of his cigarette, he said to him. He withdrew his gaze from [Li Cangdong]'s boss and leaned on the table.
0:14:36|0:14:47|After speaking, [Li Cangdong] boss left from behind [Xi Gui], while [Xi Gui] remained standing in place. At dusk, [Li Cangdong] boss drove his car while making a phone call.
0:14:52|0:15:6|In the evening, on the bustling street, [Li Cangdong] parked his car next to the newspaper stand at the corner. After the boss placed a bundle of newspapers on the passenger seat, he started the car and drove away. The next day, [Li Cangdong] arrived at the dance studio.
0:15:36|0:15:39|The beauty found a black bag under the desk in the office.
0:15:56|0:16:7|At this moment, [Li Cangdong]'s boss approached the elevator and was about to press the button when the elevator rang. As the elevator doors opened, a middle-aged man with glasses and a similarly bespectacled man stepped out.
0:16:7|0:16:22|The two walked towards the direction of [Li Cangdong]'s boss, who had already hidden in the stairwell. The next day, the released prisoner [Xi Gui] walked desolately on the road, but not far from him, someone was staring at him intently. He then made a phone call to his companion.
0:16:26|0:16:38|Late at night, the once bustling street is now deserted with only a few scattered individuals and trash littering the ground. [Xi Gui], leaning against a utility pole across from the Yongxing Hotel, carefully observes every move at the hotel.
0:16:40|0:16:47|Suddenly, a white commercial van appeared at the entrance of the Yongxing Hotel. The man driving the van got out and opened the back door, saying:
0:16:54|0:17:2|Upon seeing his younger sister, [Xi Gui] picked up the nearby bucket of slop water and splashed it directly at the man leaning against the car door. He then quickly pulled his frightened sister away.
0:17:4|0:17:14|Unexpectedly, the two fleeing individuals ran into the loan sharks coming out of the store. As Xi Gui stepped back, they were subdued by the loan sharks. Xi Gui was thrown onto the street and beaten by the group.
0:17:42|0:17:56|After finishing his loan shark threats, he turned around and pulled his younger sister back. The road was covered with the fresh blood of [Xi Gui], who was trying to stand up with blood all over his face. He twisted his painful body and propped himself up on one side.
0:17:56|0:18:13|Shortly after, [Xi Gui] dragged his agonizing body forward, but he hadn't taken a few steps when he suddenly noticed police officers passing by. He immediately turned around and ran in the opposite direction. At this moment, the hazy late night seemed even more mysterious, and under the dim light, his diminishing figure was reflected.
0:18:14|0:18:21|On the other side, [Li Cangdong] stood under the bridge holding fruits, gazing ahead, while the woman beside him said
0:18:39|0:19:0|After speaking, [Li Cangdong] took the things from the woman's hand. Then, he walked straight ahead. Meanwhile, the disheveled [Fei Weng] was devouring food voraciously. However, [Fei Weng] didn't listen to him at all. After putting the food into his mouth, he suddenly raised his head and took a gulp of beer.
0:19:1|0:19:15|Shortly after, [Fei Weng] looked around and instinctively dodged when he saw [Li Cangdong] offering him food. Then he took a sip of beer and started to size up [Li Cangdong]. Meanwhile, [Li Cangdong] patiently continued to cook for him.
0:19:20|0:19:25|At this moment, [Fei Weng] was shivering in the wind, and the chopsticks were also tapping on the soda can.
0:19:37|0:19:40|Paused his actions and looked at him.
0:19:43|0:19:58|With a furrowed brow, [Li Cangdong] silently puts the vegetables into the pot. Meanwhile, on the other side, a white car is set off with an alarm by someone. Hiding in the corner, [Xi Gui] has his hands in the pockets of his jacket, glancing over at the car that triggered the alarm.
0:19:58|0:20:17|When no one was around, he approached the car, opened the hood, quickly located the alarm wire, and cut it. Then, he used a device to trigger the door wire, successfully opening the door. He swiftly got into the car, plugged the car's ignition device into a simple device, and smoothly started the car with a skilled process.
0:20:17|0:20:33|Shortly after, Xi Gui drove his car out of the side road, and just as he was about to accelerate, a black car suddenly appeared in front of him, blocking his way. At this moment, the person in the front passenger seat got out of the car, and the car turned its head towards his direction.
0:20:33|0:20:40|After the car's headlights turned off, he finally saw the person across from him. And [Li Cangdong] looked towards the passenger seat and said.
0:20:53|0:21:0|Xi Gui takes off his hat, gently touching the wound on his forehead, while Li Cangdong looks straight ahead.
0:21:2|0:21:21|And after a long silence, [Xi Gui], who had not spoken for a long time, hesitated for a moment before speaking. [Li Cangdong] showed no mercy towards him at this moment. The two men in the car stared at each other intently. With a vacant look in his eyes, [Xi Gui] looked down, at a loss for what to do.
0:21:21|0:21:36|Suddenly, on the road next to the railway tracks, a racing car and a motorcycle appeared, slowly driving into the empty space filled with racing cars. And just as Xi Gui parked the car, all eyes in the scene turned to this unfamiliar racing car.
0:21:36|0:21:50|Xi Gui got out of the car. With a bandage on his head, he found the organizer of the race and listened to the rules of the track. Meanwhile, someone was filming everything not far away.
0:21:56|0:22:2|Xi Gui leaned against the car, gazing at them. At this moment, a man in a black shirt walked towards him.
0:22:8|0:22:19|After listening, the man in black took out his phone from his pocket. Meanwhile, someone hiding in the dark was capturing every detail. On the other side, [Li Cangdong] answered the phone.
0:22:23|0:22:39|Suddenly, a racing car rushed out, leading the pack with cars of various colors closely behind. At this moment, [Xi Gui] was driving a white sedan, preparing to overtake. He observed the movements of the cars ahead, seized the opportunity to quickly pull alongside, and disdainfully glanced at the opponent.
0:22:39|0:22:48|At the turn, a car suddenly blocked the road, forcing Xi Gui and the vehicles in front of him to brake urgently.
0:22:58|0:23:7|On the other side, the harassed Xi Gui quickly adjusted his state and overtook a race car by using the bend to overtake, with a furrowed brow and greater pressure hidden in his heart.
0:23:16|0:23:34|At this moment, the scene of his younger sister being chased on the street suddenly appeared in his mind. Then, with a fierce expression, he wanted to overtake again at the last bend, but the car he had just passed was closely following him. As he was adjusting, the car behind him crashed into the back of his car.
0:23:34|0:23:52|He quickly turned the steering wheel to park the car by the roadside to prevent the opponent from hitting again. Finally, when he saw the opponent pass by, he returned to the right track, stepped on the gas pedal fiercely, and caught up. At this moment, he was no longer afraid, quickly overtaking the vehicle in front, but causing the car to hit the roadside fence.
0:23:52|0:24:10|Sparks flew as the collision occurred, and the vehicle that had just hit him appeared slightly flustered upon seeing him. With determination, he quickly adjusted his speed, veering from the outside lane to the front, pressing the vehicle that had collided with him behind. At this moment, all the race cars entered the tunnel one by one.
0:24:10|0:24:21|A large number of police cars, led by the traffic police, arrived at the entrance and exit of the tunnel. On the other side, a racing team led by [Xi Gui] was chasing inside the tunnel. Suddenly, the [police captain] received a phone call.
0:24:29|0:24:34|[Xi Gui] quickly made a U-turn and drove in the opposite direction.
0:24:40|0:24:44|Waiting for him at the entrance were a large number of police officers.
0:25:8|0:25:28|Stealthily, [Xi Gui] crept through the bushes, climbed up the nearby hill, and then crossed over it to reach the road below. Just as he was calming his anxious heart, the phone in his pocket rang.
0:25:29|0:25:37|On the other side, [Li Cangdong's Boss] sat in the mahjong hall, and behind him walked a bald, scar-faced fat man.
0:26:33|0:26:42|When she finally recognized that it was her brother, she hurried forward and embraced him. At that moment, her brother's broad shoulders brought her a long-lost sense of security.
0:26:42|0:26:59|And when [Xi Gui's Younger Sister] saw her sister unharmed, tears welled up in her eyes. She comforted her sister with one hand, and the two embraced tightly on the street, unwilling to part for a long time. The next day, as soon as [Li Cangdong's Boss] stepped out of the subway, he headed straight towards the residential area covered by iron mesh.
0:26:59|0:27:16|Following that, he arrived at the commercial building inside the residential area. Just as he entered the children's area, Xi Gui's Younger Sister, He, appeared behind him. He was walking and smoking a cigarette, carefully observing his surroundings. Li Cangdong's Boss had already passed through the children's area and was moving between various shops.
0:27:17|0:27:29|The flags on the shop signs fluttered high, prominently reminding passersby of the types of goods available. The fixed areas restricted the display of their merchandise, occupying the aisles and narrowing the distance between the shops.
0:27:30|0:27:37|Due to the fast pace of [Li Cangdong's Boss], [Xi Gui's Younger Sister] got lost, so he blindly chose a path and walked in.
0:27:56|0:28:10|Shortly after, [Li Cangdong's Boss] walked out of the room with an incense stick, squatted down, and inserted the incense into the ground at the door. Meanwhile, [Xi Gui's Younger Sister] had also entered the residential building, searching for the clues left by [Li Cangdong's Boss].
0:28:48|0:28:54|Helpless, [Xi Gui] closed his eyes.
0:29:8|0:29:19|After speaking, [Li Cangdong] took out a black folder from his handbag and handed the documents inside to [Xi Gui]. With his head held high, [Xi Gui] looked at him disdainfully.
0:29:53|0:30:9|Following that, [Li Cangdong] put the documents into an envelope, took out beeswax and a seal, melted the beeswax, dripped it on the opening of the envelope, and then stamped it with a special seal. Late at night, Brother [Tai Ping] took [Xi Gui] on a speedboat to a boat anchored in the center of the lake, and said to him.
0:30:38|0:30:51|After speaking, [La Zhan] stood up and sat back down on the stool. At the same time, fearing being accidentally injured, [Bao Zhu] saw the two stop fighting and pulled a chair back to the table. The sister-in-law walked out of the cabin and sat in an empty seat, bypassing the crowd.
0:30:52|0:30:59|At this moment, [Tai Ping] immediately stood up, picked up the wine bottle to pour a drink for his sister-in-law, who smiled at him and held the cup with her hand.
0:31:0|0:31:5|Later, Sister-in-law noticed Xi Gui and looked at him as if she had seen him somewhere before.
0:31:7|0:31:18|[Tai Ping] put down his wine glass, walked to the side, and discussed something with [Hua Tian]. The hanging lamp on the boat swayed with the wind, casting a flickering light on [Hua Tian]'s face. Then, the two of them sat down at the table.
0:31:32|0:31:41|[Hua Tian] nodded in satisfaction and then looked at [Xi Gui].
0:31:55|0:32:0|[Hua Tian] poured out the tea in [A Di]'s cup and replaced it with alcohol. Seeing her silent, he asked.
0:32:2|0:32:9|Dejected [A Di] slowly lifted his head after a moment of hesitation, looking at him solemnly before speaking to him.
0:32:18|0:32:30|[Hua Tian] forced a smile in response. Meanwhile, [A Di] raised the cup of wine behind him and then picked up the teapot.
0:32:46|0:33:1|[Li Cangdong] looked helplessly at the computer screen, pressed a few keys, and then spoke to him again. After that, [Li Cangdong] turned his head to start working, while [Xi Gui] was in a daze, playing with the stick in his mouth without speaking.
0:33:6|0:33:15|Xi Gui stopped his actions and said. After a moment of thought, Li Cangdong spoke.
0:33:17|0:33:32|Subsequently, various vehicles lined up on both sides of the street, with [Xi Gui] leaning against a car door, cigarette in his mouth, playing with a cigarette box in his hand. He looked around and stopped his actions when he saw [A Di], who then threw a bag at him.
0:33:33|0:33:48|With a puzzled look on his face, [Xi Gui] took the bag and went to change clothes. At this time, [A Di] sat in the passenger seat, smoking a cigarette, waiting for him. Shortly after, [Xi Gui], who had changed his clothes, first opened the rear door to put the bag in, and then sat in the driver's seat.
0:33:48|0:34:6|Xi Gui is driving the car, while A Di is sitting next to her lost in thought. Suddenly, the phone rings, breaking the silence. A Di takes out her phone and sees a new text message, which reads, "Now is not the time, get rid of the baby." She then makes a phone call.
0:34:13|0:34:28|After a moment, the two appeared on a bustling street, crossed the zebra crossing with people coming and going, and walked straight into a jewelry store. The serious-looking [A Di] walked at the front, while [Xi Gui] followed closely behind, carrying bags of various sizes.
0:34:28|0:34:42|Later, Xi Gui pushed open the door for A Di, but A Di did not respond, instead looking around at the gold and silver jewelry. Then, Xi Gui, who entered the store, looked at the camera in the corner.
0:34:44|0:34:53|The salesperson looked towards the counter. [A Di] responded casually to the smiling salesperson. But after sitting down, she stared intently at the pair of rings on the counter.
0:34:55|0:35:1|Standing behind, Xi Gui, silent, while A Di raised his head thoughtfully and looked at the shopkeeper.
0:35:6|0:35:21|Shortly after, the salesperson reached into the counter and took out a ring. Meanwhile, standing behind him, [Xi Gui] suddenly shifted his gaze from the ring to the security guard outside the glass window who was holding a letter. But just as he looked at the clock inside the store, [A Di] suddenly stood up.
0:35:46|0:35:55|Night falls quietly amidst the sounds of revelry. The two of them are sitting at a street-side stall, enjoying hotpot. [A Di] says to the waitress who is serving the dishes.
0:35:56|0:36:2|He Xi Gui immediately stopped what she was doing and looked at him, glaring fiercely at his brother A Di and shouted.
0:36:4|0:36:17|Before long, three barrels of beer appeared in front of them. Holding a cigarette, [Xi Gui] opened a bottle of beer and reached for an empty glass. Just as he was pouring the beer, [A Di] snatched the bottle with a look of disdain, then gestured to clink glasses.
0:36:17|0:36:35|Xi Gui immediately picked up the bottle and clinked it with his, took the cigarette out of his mouth, and started drinking. A Di, on the other hand, tilted her head back and chugged the drink, with the liquid sliding down her mouth, but she showed no intention of stopping, continuing to close her eyes tightly and gulp down the beer. After taking a big sip, Xi Gui put down the bottle and looked at her.
0:36:36|0:36:55|Late at night, the vendors had already gone home, leaving only the lamp on the table to stand guard. [A Di], who was drunk as a skunk, leaned against the rolling shutter door with one foot propped up on a stool. After taking a big gulp of beer, she looked at [Xi Gui] next to her, who was smiling bitterly.
0:37:9|0:37:14|Xi Gui is being chased by the police on the street, while A Di is being hunted down by members of the gang on the other side.
0:37:20|0:37:27|The police chased after the gangsters, but the two of them managed to escape. [A Di] glanced at [Xi Gui], then lowered his head and said.
0:37:35|0:37:42|[A Di] placed her hand on the bottle, which was shaking constantly. Suddenly, she lifted her heavy head and pointed towards [Xi Gui].
0:37:43|0:37:52|At this moment, [Xi Gui] looked at her with a puzzled expression on his face, but she responded with a smile. Then, she forced herself to sit up straight despite her fatigue, but kept her eyes tightly shut.
0:38:24|0:38:41|In the midst of reminiscing, [A Di] was immersed in joy. Suddenly, her smiling face turned serious. At this moment, her heart was warm. With a cold laugh, she picked up a bottle and clinked it against [Xi Gui]'s bottle.
0:38:43|0:38:54|She, who was on the verge of tears, drank the remaining wine in big gulps. She used to trust him so much, but now, he doesn't care at all. He even made her get rid of her own flesh and blood.
0:38:54|0:39:7|At this moment, [A Di] was in excruciating pain. Numb from alcohol, she collapsed, and across from her, [Xi Gui] immediately reached out to support her head and gently lay it on the table. [Xi Gui] couldn't help but feel a tug at her heart as she looked at her.
0:39:8|0:39:22|After calming down, she watched as [Xi Gui] reached for her bag, took out her phone, and then lowered her head to transfer the data from her phone to her own. In no time, [Xi Gui] put [A Di]'s phone back.
0:39:22|0:39:31|But he felt very uneasy inside, feeling guilty towards [A Di] and the trust he had in him. However, he had promised [Li Cangdong], so in his desperate attempt to save his younger sister, he chose the latter.
0:39:31|0:39:49|Shortly after, he looked at the figure in front of him and felt inexplicably heartbroken. He stood up, picked up the jacket placed aside, and walked slowly to [A Di]'s side. Thoughtfully, he covered [A Di] with the jacket. Moments later, the dim streetlights cast a slanting light on the street, and the buildings lit up one by one.
0:39:49|0:39:57|At the entrance of a house, a stick of incense was lit in front of the Earth God statue. [Li Cangdong] took the memory card handed to him by [Xi Gui] and looked at it.
0:40:20|0:40:26|Disappointed, Xi Gui slowly lowered his head.
0:40:40|0:40:52|With a furrowed brow, [Li Cangdong] looked at him in deep thought, but he couldn't afford to be soft-hearted. So he turned around, let down his guard from the past, lowered his head, swallowed hard, and sincerely said to [Xi Gui].
0:41:46|0:42:0|Sitting in the car, [Li Cangdong] carefully observed the streets on both sides. Suddenly, a couple not far away walked out of a shop door, embraced each other at the doorway, and then walked in different directions. At the same time, [Li Cangdong]'s phone rang.
0:42:20|0:42:36|After speaking, the taxi stopped by the street. [Li Cangdong] got off the car, observed the vehicles on both sides, and quickly ran towards the opposite street. A man who had just walked out of the store was briskly moving through the crowd, and at that moment, [Li Cangdong] on the opposite street noticed him.
0:42:36|0:42:43|Li Cangdong, who stopped in his tracks, carefully observed his every move. The more he looked, the more he felt something was wrong, so he turned and walked towards the direction he was heading.
0:42:52|0:43:3|At this moment, all the teammates hidden in the crowd are searching for the suspect based on the characteristics provided by [Li Cangdong]. Meanwhile, [Li Cangdong] walking on the opposite street is closely watching the man's every move.
0:43:4|0:43:11|Suddenly, the man looked up at the building next to him and then walked in. [Li Cangdong], who was following closely behind, immediately called out to his companion.
0:43:12|0:43:27|Guizi quickly caught up, and then, a female Guizi stood guard at the entrance. Inside the building, [Hua Tian] stood in the crowd waiting for the elevator, while the approaching Guizi and his companions walked forward, hiding communication devices.
0:43:28|0:43:36|Before long, the elevator doors slowly opened, and [Hua Tian] walked in at the front, followed by [Shi Zai] and his companions entering nonchalantly.
0:43:37|0:43:51|After the elevator doors closed, [Hua Tian] reached out from behind and pressed the button for the 10th floor. Without hesitation, [Shi Zai] pressed the button for the 8th floor next to it. However, their companion pressed the button for the 12th floor, creating an extremely tense atmosphere inside the elevator.
0:43:51|0:44:0|After a moment, they arrived at the 8th floor. Acting nonchalantly, [Shi Zai] leisurely walked out of the elevator. As soon as the elevator doors closed, he immediately ran towards the stairwell on the side.
0:44:0|0:44:9|Just as he was running towards the 10th floor with all his might, he ran into [Hua Tian] who was coming down the stairs. At that moment, he became cautious and then informed [Li Cangdong].
0:44:26|0:44:44|[Hua Tian], who had a sense of something, rushed into the parking lot. [Li Cangdong], who had been running all the way, headed straight to the other side after confirming he had entered. In the elevator leading to the parking lot, a long-haired beauty pressed the button, and [Hua Tian] walked in. He frowned and stood behind the beauty, watching the elevator doors.
0:44:44|0:44:56|Shortly after, [Li Cangdong] quickly arrived at the exit of the parking lot. He stood in a corner, looking around. Soon after, a fleet of taxis also arrived, parking on the side of the road, waiting for [Li Cangdong]'s orders.
0:44:57|0:45:5|At this moment, a car slowly pulled out of the parking lot and stopped at the toll booth on the slope, catching the attention of [Li Cangdong], but he did not approach to intercept.
0:45:14|0:45:29|Shortly after, [Li Cangdong] entered the parking lot and searched for [Hua Tian] based on the location, but instead he found [Hua Tian]'s phone on the parking spot. Meanwhile, [Hua Tian] was using a public telephone.
0:45:31|0:45:44|Under the elevated bridge in the outskirts, deafening gunshots rang out. Two henchmen stood behind Tai Ping, who was designated to handle the money. At that moment, A Di placed the rifle on the bag at Tai Ping's feet, then picked up a handgun and walked towards Xi Gui. But Xi Gui looked at her seriously and said.
0:45:48|0:45:55|With a contemptuous smile, [A Di] walked straight to the side, while Xi Gui, who was standing in place, looked at her in surprise as she aimed the gun at the empty space.
0:45:58|0:46:11|After Tai Ping settled everything, the five of them split up. Tai Ping and two of his men returned the same way, while He Xi Kui and A Di climbed up from under the bridge to the road surface. Then, A Di got into a car parked by the roadside directly.
0:46:11|0:46:19|Xi Gui first opened the back door of the car, put the backpack full of guns inside, and then sat in the driver's seat before slowly starting the car.
0:46:26|0:46:32|Watching as Xi Gui's Younger Sister's A Di showed a pleased smile. The praised Xi Gui's Younger Sister revealed a long-lost smile.
0:46:33|0:46:41|Sitting close to the seat, [A Di] glanced at [Xi Gui's Younger Sister] who was driving. After a moment, she looked out the window at the scenery and said thoughtfully.
0:46:59|0:47:11|The broadcast in the car made [A Di] sigh. Past experiences flashed before his eyes like the scenery outside the window.
0:47:12|0:47:27|Suddenly, Xi Gui's Younger Sister, [Xi Gui's Younger Sister], had a flashback of him and his sister walking hand in hand on the street. Sympathetic, A Di looked at him and said.
0:47:39|0:47:53|With an expressionless face, [Xi Gui's Younger Sister] looked at [A Di] who longed to be cared for, feeling full of sympathy. Then, [Xi Gui's Younger Sister] turned the car onto another street, only to unexpectedly encounter a police car inspection, causing the two of them to look at each other nervously.
0:47:53|0:48:9|Under the guidance of the police, He [Xi Gui's Younger Sister] slowly parked the car by the roadside and waited for inspection. The two inside the car were on pins and needles. Meanwhile, He [Xi Gui's Younger Sister] observed the passing vehicles through the rearview mirror. At the same time, a police officer slowly approached them.
0:48:9|0:48:17|And gestured for him to roll down the car window. Subsequently, the police officer spoke to him with the half-opened car window.
0:49:8|0:49:12|As the police car behind was about to collide, it quickly turned the steering wheel and slammed on the brakes.
0:49:26|0:49:39|At this moment, Xi Gui was moving against the traffic, dodging the passing vehicles. Suddenly, a large truck blocked his path, so he quickly passed through the gap in front of the truck. However, as he crossed the road, he was hit to the side by a small car.
0:49:39|0:49:54|Shortly after, without any hesitation, he heard the sound of a police siren and immediately unbuckled his seatbelt. He leaned over to open the passenger door, then quickly got out of the car to pull out [A Di]. He then ran to the other side to grab a bag filled with firearms.
0:49:55|0:50:2|Suddenly, he saw the police getting out of the car, so he grabbed [A Di] and ran.
0:50:4|0:50:17|They ran across the street towards the crowded street, with a large number of police officers closely following, launching a pursuit. Leading the way, Xi Gui looked back at A Di, who was running slower and slower, so he grabbed her and ran forward with all his might.
0:50:17|0:50:30|Suddenly, Xi Gui noticed that there were police officers ahead. He grabbed A Di and slowed down, turning left onto another road. Confused, A Di just followed him without hesitation. However, they hadn't run far before encountering more police officers in front of them.
0:50:31|0:50:37|They then ran towards the nearby market, where goods were hanging everywhere in a messy manner.
0:50:40|0:50:47|He [Xi Gui] pulled [A Di] through the narrow aisle, using merchandise as cover to evade the police's sight.
0:50:49|0:50:53|The police then split into two groups, carefully searching for Xi Gui and A Di who might be hiding in different corners.
0:50:56|0:51:9|At the same time, the two who were looking for an exit saw the police ahead. They quickly turned around and ran towards another corridor, but they were intercepted not far away. Thinking quickly, [Xi Gui] pulled [A Di] into a nearby shop to hide.
0:51:9|0:51:25|At this moment, [Xi Gui] held his breath, carefully listening to the sounds outside, while [A Di], with blood at the corner of his mouth, stared intently at the police outside through the gap in the hanging clothes. Seeing the police walk away, the two immediately turned back, but they were halfway there when they spotted the police.
0:51:25|0:51:32|Xi Gui hesitated for a moment, then retreated without hesitation, looking for another way out. But just as he was about to run, police suddenly appeared in front of him.
0:51:33|0:51:40|The two quickly pressed against the wall covered with clothes, but the police on both sides approached the location where the two were at the same time.
0:51:58|0:52:15|At this moment, he exuded masculine hormones under the dim light. When he turned to look at [A Di], [A Di] couldn't help but kiss him. He was at a loss and froze instantly, but [A Di] bit his lower lip again, enveloping the two in an ambiguous atmosphere.
0:52:51|0:53:6|Li Cangdong, who was standing still, pointed at him. Suddenly, Tai Ping appeared in the residential building. Frowning, he looked at the incense burning on the doorstep of a family. Just then, Xi Gui's phone rang.
0:53:13|0:53:17|Looking at the door, [Xi Gui] hung up the phone and turned to [Li Cangdong].
0:53:18|0:53:23|The knocking on the door sounded again, and [Li Cangdong], with a blank expression, grabbed his handbag and walked towards the house.
0:53:24|0:53:34|Shortly after, the composed Xi Gui swiftly arrived at the door and opened it calmly. Outside the door, Tai Ping, leaning against the door frame, glanced at him before walking into the house.
0:53:35|0:53:48|Cautious Xi Gui calmly closed the door, then turned around with an uneasy heart and walked towards Tai Ping, who was looking around. Tai Ping then put his arm around Xi Gui's shoulder, and the two of them walked and talked.
0:53:51|0:53:58|Saying that, [Tai Ping] casually opened the door next to him, and [Li Cangdong] hiding in the room immediately ducked behind the door.
0:54:4|0:54:11|Next, the two of them walked to the balcony, with [Tai Ping] carefully inspecting every corner of the balcony, while [Xi Gui] returned to the room and lit a cigarette.
0:54:13|0:54:19|[Tai Ping] looked at [Xi Gui] seriously, while [Xi Gui] calmly took a cigarette and said.
0:54:25|0:54:30|After speaking, [Tai Ping] turned around and opened the door, while [Li Cangdong], who was hiding in the room, took the opportunity to sneak towards the balcony.
0:54:31|0:54:38|Upon hearing the noise, [Tai Ping] immediately turned around, glanced at [Xi Gui] behind him, and then walked past him towards the room to check behind the door.
0:54:38|0:54:55|Later, [Tai Ping] walked to the door, pointing at the door next to him. [Xi Gui], who was smoking with his head down, immediately looked up and hesitated for a moment before speaking to him. Then, [Tai Ping] waved to [Xi Gui], signaling him to come over. Next, [Tai Ping] put his arm around him and walked towards the door next to them.
0:54:56|0:55:4|At the same time, hiding on the balcony, [Li Cangdong] secretly looked towards the living room. Seeing no one there, he immediately opened the balcony window and climbed out.
0:55:5|0:55:14|[Tai Ping] rang the bell but no one answered, so he knocked on the door with his hand. Suddenly, the door opened, and the nervous [Xi Gui] instantly became tense.
0:55:14|0:55:25|The dialect-speaking old lady gestured excitedly, and at that moment, [Li Cangdong] walked towards the door while eating something, and pushed the old lady aside to stand in front of the two.
0:55:52|0:56:2|Xi Gui pretended to nod calmly, while Tai Ping, with a furrowed brow, left directly. Inside the house, Li Cangdong took out a few hundred yuan from his wallet and stuffed it into his mother-in-law's hand.
0:56:4|0:56:16|At night, the neon lights on the street were colorful, constantly shining their brilliance. The stalls on the side of the street added a lively atmosphere to the city. Behind the stalls, [Fei Weng] was walking and eating a boxed meal in a disheveled manner.
0:56:16|0:56:24|Suddenly, he saw a beauty walking out of the opposite store. So, he stood in the corner eating his boxed meal, but his eyes kept fixed on the beauty.
0:56:25|0:56:40|At this moment, the beauty across suddenly looked up at him, but he immediately turned his head to avoid her gaze. Then, he saw a car parked not far away, and when he recognized that it was [A Xue] approaching, he got so scared that he knocked over the lunch box, and then quickly hid in a corner.
0:56:51|0:57:2|Shortly after, [Li Cangdong] appeared under the bridge, holding a box. As he walked towards the house made of cardboard boxes, he looked inside. Just as he was about to stick his head in, a metallic sound came from the pitch-black paper house.
0:57:2|0:57:12|Suddenly, a short knife stabbed towards him, and [Li Cangdong] quickly grabbed the hand. [Li Cangdong] took the knife.
0:57:43|0:57:58|Later, he picked up the photo in his hand and carefully observed the woman singing on it. Meanwhile, in the studio, [Li Cangdong] and his boss stood in front of a wall covered with photos.
0:58:4|0:58:10|He then turned and walked towards the table where the phone was placed. He picked up the phone, pressed the answer button, and held it to his ear, saying.
0:58:14|0:58:20|Li Cangdong, who was driving, slowly lifted his head and looked at Fei Weng lying in the back seat through the rearview mirror.
0:58:35|0:58:48|Suddenly, a rolling door slowly rises from inside, and a man walks out. He cautiously looks around before heading towards a side street. At this moment, [Li Cangdong], who has parked his car not far away, is sitting in the car watching everything.
0:58:48|0:59:7|A man pretending to be nonchalant walked to the corner and suddenly found a person lying on the ground. The area around the person was littered with messy bottles. After confirming that the drunk person was not moving, he waved towards the depths of the alley. Soon, a sedan drove out of the alley, slowly moving forward under the man's guidance.
0:59:7|0:59:18|Shortly after, it stopped by the road in front of the rolling shutter door. At the same time, the man knocked on the rolling shutter door, and [A Gou] walked out from inside.
0:59:37|0:59:43|The police forcefully pulled [A Gou] out of the back seat of the sedan, pressed him hard against the rolling shutter door, and handcuffed him with cold handcuffs.
0:59:49|0:59:53|Tears welled up in his eyes, a mix of emotions overwhelming him, and his tightly furrowed brow gradually relaxed.
1:0:28|1:0:36|At this moment, [Li Cangdong] was overwhelmed with emotions, finally letting go of the grudges that had been building up in his heart for years.
1:1:54|1:2:0|He pointed outside and said with a smile. The beauty was slightly embarrassed by the sudden inquiry from [Li Cangdong].
1:2:19|1:2:25|At this moment, [Li Cangdong]'s smile on his face began to stiffen, but he looked gently at the beautiful woman and said.
1:2:58|1:3:8|On the other side, [Li Cangdong], who was dancing in the studio, stopped and sat down weakly on the edge of the bed, hiding himself in the darkness. At this moment, he looked like a child who had done something wrong, with his head lowered between his shoulders. [Li Cangdong] sat across from the [doctor].
1:3:25|1:3:40|At this moment, [Li Cangdong], hiding in the corner, looks ahead. The person he loves the most is holding someone else's arm. Beside them, there is the father of his ex-wife. The two are chatting and laughing in front of a small shop. Then, a man with glasses walks towards the old man with a drink in his hand. The man with glasses turns around with a puzzled look on his face.
1:3:59|1:4:5|The old man, expressionless, let out a deep sigh and shook his head.
1:4:7|1:4:13|After speaking, the two of them slowly lowered their heads. In the studio on the other side, [Li Cangdong] looked at [Li Cangdong's Boss] who was smoking beside him.
1:4:14|1:4:24|Li Cangdong's Boss took a deep drag on his cigar and said.
1:4:37|1:4:42|At this moment, [Li Cangdong] furrowed his brow, looking at [Li Cangdong's Boss] with such a determined gaze, and eventually compromised.
1:4:56|1:5:6|In the pitch-black night, outside the dark residential building, a gloomy and silent atmosphere pervades. As [Li Cangdong] sleeps soundly, his body gradually curls up into a ball, his forehead breaking out in a cold sweat.
1:5:32|1:5:48|At the same time, images appeared in [Li Cangdong]'s mind. In the images, his informant was trapped in the middle of an iron gate, desperately seeking help, but he was not there by the informant's side. Feeling guilty, [Li Cangdong] sat on the edge of the bed.
1:6:9|1:6:32|The last conversation with the informant kept echoing in his ears, and he gradually disappeared into the darkness, feeling torn. Later, he appeared on the street driving a car, with no one around, the lights from nearby shops shining on him. Then, he picked up his phone, dialed a number, and held it to his ear, waiting for someone to answer.
1:6:42|1:6:47|And Xi Gui, who was in the residential building, leaned against the wall with a vacant look in his eyes, staring fixedly out the window.
1:6:50|1:7:4|After speaking, he immediately hung up the phone, not giving the other party any chance to speculate on his emotions. On the other side, [Li Cangdong], still feeling lingering fear, looked out the window, then lowered his head to turn off his phone. He picked up the briefcase on the passenger seat, opened the car door, and got out.
1:7:4|1:7:17|As he walked straight towards the shop across the street, his former father-in-law happened to pass by. The father-in-law stood in place, carefully observing his figure. After confirming it was him, he angrily walked towards him.
1:7:19|1:7:35|Shortly after, as he sat on a bench outside the lounge preparing to change his shoes, his father-in-law happened to walk by. The father-in-law looked around searching for his figure, and upon seeing him, quickly ran up to him.
1:7:37|1:7:50|The father-in-law picked up the trophy and smashed it towards his head. In an instant, [Li Cangdong]'s head was covered in blood. He covered the wound with his hand, but his body slowly slid to the ground, while the father-in-law stared with wide eyes at his daughter standing at the door.
1:7:50|1:8:4|The daughter who witnessed all this with her own eyes couldn't help but shed tears as she looked at [Li Cangdong], whose face was covered in blood. Unable to accept it, she turned and ran out. Her father-in-law immediately chased after her, while [Li Cangdong], lying on the ground, gritted his teeth and struggled to get up.
1:8:4|1:8:19|When he chased out, what he saw were the marks of emergency braking. It turned out that just as the woman ran out of the door, a black sedan suddenly drove out and hit her out. Following closely behind, [A Xue's Father] saw his daughter being knocked down by the car and fainted on the ground in an instant.
1:8:20|1:8:30|[Li Cangdong's Boss] rushed over from the car and, upon seeing the woman lying on the ground, he immediately ran forward. In a daze, he fell to his knees in front of the woman and sensibly took out his phone to call for emergency assistance.
1:8:45|1:9:4|After speaking, he immediately turned and ran towards the woman lying on the ground. Upon seeing the woman's thin top, he unhesitatingly took off his jacket and covered her with it. Then, in a hurry, he looked at the motionless woman on the ground, filled with self-blame and guilt, and anxiously bent down to kiss the woman's cheek.
1:9:11|1:9:19|He then moved his hands away from the woman's body, holding them up in the air. At the same time, he furrowed his brow and kept shaking his head with blood still flowing.
1:9:21|1:9:41|He sobbed uncontrollably, hands covering his face drenched in blood. Slowly, he lifted his head to look at the woman. In despair, he kept shaking his head. Having experienced despair once before, he allowed this tragedy to happen to himself again, so he leaned down to the woman's ear.
1:9:56|1:10:10|Before long, the ambulance transported all the injured individuals to the hospital. Outside the operating room, two people were sitting. [Li Cangdong]'s father-in-law had bandages on his head, looking up at the ceiling, while sitting next to him was a man who was having an affair with a woman.
1:10:10|1:10:18|On the other side, [Li Cangdong], with bandages on his head, sat expressionless in the car, his brows furrowed tightly as he stared ahead intently.
1:10:19|1:10:24|The next day, various noisy sounds could be heard on the bustling streets.
1:10:27|1:10:44|Shortly after, a taxi stopped at the intersection, and not far away, another taxi also stopped. Immediately, [Ma Da] and [Bao Zhu] looked around and quickly walked towards the alley. They arrived in front of the zipper that had been waiting here for a long time, while at the same time, [Tai Ping] walked out from another alley.
1:10:44|1:10:48|The four characters gathered together and looked towards the approaching car.
1:11:8|1:11:14|Sitting in the back row, [Ma Da] took the bag handed by [Tai Ping] and proceeded to remove the batteries from everyone's phones one by one.
1:11:15|1:11:24|At this moment, everyone in the car has put on white gloves. And [Tai Ping], sitting in the passenger seat, occasionally looks back at the situation behind the car through the rearview mirror.
1:11:24|1:11:34|Shortly after, [Tai Ping], who had withdrawn his gaze, noticed the traffic jam on the bridge ahead. Frowning, he rested his arm on the car window and stared fixedly at the vehicles in front.
1:11:35|1:11:41|Xi Gui followed closely and slowly parked the car on the road, while Tai Ping impatiently glanced at the rearview mirror and said.
1:12:0|1:12:8|The car door was opened from the inside by [Tai Ping], who grabbed the woman by her hair and dragged her out of the car. Then, everyone quickly got into the car.
1:12:13|1:12:20|Night fell quickly, with five henchmen scattered outside the room waiting, while Xi Gui sat on the roof smoking a cigarette.
1:12:34|1:12:44|After speaking, [A Di] got up and walked towards the refrigerator. [Hua Tian], who was frowning, followed closely behind and asked.
1:12:47|1:13:0|At this moment, [Hua Tian]'s phone suddenly rang, while [A Di] leaned against the refrigerator and smoked heavily. [Hua Tian] took out the phone and hung up directly, placing it on the table, as [A Di] looked at the phone and said with a wry smile on his face.
1:13:2|1:13:14|She then turned around with a look of disdain, walked towards the table, and put down the beer in her hand. Meanwhile, [Hua Tian]'s phone rang again, and she sat on the chair next to the table, smoking and looking at [Hua Tian].
1:13:14|1:13:21|Shortly after, [Hua Tian] picked up her phone, looked at it, and pressed the answer button, holding it to her ear. Then, [Hua Tian]'s eyes wandered aimlessly.
1:13:23|1:13:30|At this moment, [A Di] was consumed by jealousy, her hand shaking as she smoked. She stood up, snatched [Hua Tian]'s phone and threw it to the ground.
1:13:38|1:13:44|After speaking, [Hua Tian] stormed out, while the humiliated [A Di] kicked the bed frame aside and took a deep drag of a cigarette.
1:13:46|1:13:54|In the corridor, the calm and cool [Hua Tian] walks while smoking a cigarette, and silently takes the cigarette box handed to him by [Tai Ping] who is following behind.
1:14:5|1:14:10|Tai Ping, smoking, looked at Hua Tian in shock. On the other side, He Xi Kui stood by the balcony watching.
1:14:10|1:14:33|A sanitation worker downstairs is cleaning the street. Afterwards, he puts down his beer and sits on the steps nearby. Then, he takes out his hand from his pocket, glances behind him, and starts to write "Please notify" on the money. But just as he is about to continue writing, he suddenly hears a sound behind him. Cautiously, he puts away the money and pen, then turns around to look behind him.
1:14:33|1:14:41|He saw [A Di] sitting alone on the steps holding his stomach, then he walked towards [A Di] with a cup of water.
1:14:42|1:14:58|[A Di] lifted her head and looked at the man in front of her. Seeing that Xi Gui didn't take the water glass from her hand, he picked up her hand and placed it on the glass. Looking at the water in her hand, [A Di] gritted her teeth and took a sip. It was this man in front of her who gave her warmth in her loneliest moments.
1:14:58|1:15:17|She then stopped sobbing, slowly lifted her head to look at [Xi Gui]. [Xi Gui], who was looking at Tai Ping, shifted his gaze to [A Di]. The two of them looked at each other in silence. After a moment, everyone returned to the room. [A Di] leaned against the cabinet, drinking beer.
1:15:17|1:15:20|The remaining five people stood around the table in the middle.
1:15:52|1:16:1|The zipper on the table, with hands resting on it, slowly moved back as footsteps approached. At that moment, [Ma Da] suddenly rushed forward, grabbing his collar and knocking his head against the table.
1:16:1|1:16:11|[Bao Zhu] pulled his legs from behind, causing him to fall to the ground. [Xi Gui] stood aside, dumbfounded by the scene, while Tai Ping stood nearby, frowning deeply.
1:16:11|1:16:22|Just as Xi Gui withdrew his gaze, he unintentionally met the eyes of Hua Tian. Feeling guilty, he was at a loss, but in order to avoid suspicion from Hua Tian, he still participated in the battle.
1:16:22|1:16:32|So, Xi Gui held down his legs that were struggling against the zipper, while Bao Zhu rode on top of the zipper and choked him, and Ma Da kept locking his head with his arms.
1:16:32|1:16:50|Suddenly, the strong and muscular [Bao Zhu] flipped [Ma Da] to the ground, grabbed his hair and pulled him away. At that moment, [Bao Zhu] got up and grabbed a belt from the side, putting it around the head of the zipper. Then, he mounted [Xi Gui] again, tightening the belt with all his might, while the three of them worked together to gradually immobilize the zipper.
1:16:50|1:16:57|Later, [Hua Tian] slowly walked to the front of the zipper, looking satisfied at the zipper that was no longer resisting.
1:16:58|1:17:5|With his eyes closed, [A Di] furrowed his brow, and when he opened them, he saw [Bao Zhu] and [Ma Da] carrying the zipper out.
1:17:15|1:17:24|[Tai Ping] saw [Hua Tian] walking out of the door and looked towards [Xi Gui]. The next day, the bustling streets were crowded with people.
1:17:24|1:17:37|[Ma Da] leisurely walked along the street, looking around. In the jewelry store across the street, each display had a salesperson ready to greet customers. Meanwhile, various people were walking on the street outside.
1:17:37|1:17:45|On the other side, Jingxin Jinhang pulled down the rolling shutter to check the goods. At this moment, outside, [Hua Tian] walked by and glanced inside.
1:17:45|1:18:0|In the alley, [Tai Ping] walked out aggressively with [Bao Zhu] and [Ma Da], while He Xi Gui, sitting in the car, stared intently at Tai Ping standing at the intersection. At that moment, He Xi Gui suddenly saw through the rearview mirror a person cleaning a car slowly approaching him from behind.
1:18:1|1:18:12|He then had a bold idea. He first looked at Tai Ping standing in place, then lowered his head to write something on his hand with a pen, while Bao Zhu and Ma Da had already met up with Hua Tian.
1:18:12|1:18:30|Three people successively took out the masks from their pockets. Then, the car washer lightly tapped on He Xi Kui's car window. Anxious, he looked towards [Tai Ping]. He then reached out his hand towards the glass window, with a message written in his palm, informing [Li Cangdong] at 66880693, there was a robbery on Queen's Road, Jing Xin Jing Xing.
1:18:31|1:18:44|Suddenly, [Tai Ping] turned his head and cleverly shook the hand in front of the glass window. Then, in front of Jing Xin Jin's shop, [Hua Tian] nodded at [Tai Ping]. Upon receiving the signal, [Tai Ping] immediately waved to He Xi Kui not far away.
1:18:45|1:19:5|On the other side, [Li Cangdong]'s phone rang. Outside the Jinhang Gate, [Tai Ping] held a gun to stop passing vehicles. He Xi Kui quickly drove the car out of the alley, skillfully reversing the car into the gold shop. In an instant, the alarm system inside the shop started blaring.
1:19:5|1:19:21|Amid the panic of the people around, He Xikui drove the car out of the gold shop and stopped at the entrance. And waiting at the door were Bao Zhu, Ma Da, and Hua Tian, who walked inside through the broken rolling shutter door one after another.
1:19:43|1:19:53|After the clerk crouched down, trembling hands slowly opened the safe. She pulled open the door of the safe, revealing the stack of gold bars inside. When [Hua Tian] saw so many gold bars, he was also stunned.
1:19:55|1:20:0|In the lobby of the jewelry store, Xi Gui suddenly saw a phone left on the ground.
1:20:8|1:20:16|Shortly after, [Ma Da] dragged a heavy bag outside. As they put the bag filled with gold and silver treasures into the trunk, the car involuntarily shook.
1:20:17|1:20:35|On the sides of the street, a large number of police officers were rushing towards the gold shop. The police officers pressed against the walls, slowly moving their feet forward. Just as everyone's attention was focused on [Tai Ping] on the side of the road, [Xi Gui] suddenly walked out of the store. He looked at the police officers beside him in confusion.
1:20:35|1:20:43|[Hua Tian] behind him fired first, and at this moment [Tai Ping] was attracted by the gunshot, walking and shooting at the police.
1:20:44|1:20:51|Due to the lack of cover, the police quickly retreated into the nearby store, while Xi Gui and the others, under the cover of Tai Ping, quickly got into the car and drove away.
1:21:0|1:21:15|On the other side, [A Di] opened an iron gate from the inside, while outside stood [Hua Tian] and a group of people. Driving, [Xi Gui] slowly drove the car into the warehouse. After the car was completely inside, [A Di] silently closed the door, leaving only the sunlight shining into the dark warehouse.
1:21:16|1:21:23|Shortly after, several people got off the car almost simultaneously. At this moment, [Tai Ping] stood in front of the car and spoke.
1:21:30|1:21:42|As soon as the words fell, [Xi Gui] and [Bao Zhu] handed the pistols to [Tai Ping]. Meanwhile, [A Di] stood behind the car with bandages on his face, watching everything intently. The group quickly sprang into action, preparing to destroy the evidence.
1:21:42|1:21:49|Xi Gui secretly dialed a phone number and even stuffed the phone into a crack in the wall, Li Cangdong picked up the phone.
1:21:53|1:22:2|Everything was proceeding in an orderly manner under the arrangement of [Hua Tian]. On the street, [Li Cangdong] took out a cellphone and dialed a number, whispering.
1:22:6|1:22:15|On the other side, [A Di] prepared a homemade Molotov cocktail, placed it on the car roof, leaned in to the car, picked up her own handgun, then took out a lighter from her pocket and lit the Molotov cocktail skillfully.
1:22:17|1:22:26|A Molotov cocktail was thrown into the car, causing a blaze in the back seat. Not far away, a flamethrower was spewing flames to melt gold, and [Ma Da] was extremely excited watching the gold.
1:22:27|1:22:43|He laughed wildly behind his sunglasses. Xi Gui walked over, wiped the sweat off his face, and the gold on the furnace was almost ready. Bao Zhu placed it in a basin to cool. A Di poured the re-solidified gold bars from the rough mold and weighed them on an electronic scale.
1:22:44|1:22:52|The whole team worked like an assembly line, producing gold bars without any marks. [Tai Ping] with protective goggles answered the phone.
1:23:6|1:23:16|[A Di] disdainfully glanced at the gold bar, so [Hua Tian] added another one.
1:23:17|1:23:29|And this time, [A Di] didn't even lift his head, not even looking at him, [Hua Tian] didn't say much either, turned around and left. After [Hua Tian] walked a distance, [A Di] finally turned around, glancing sideways at [Hua Tian]'s back.
1:23:30|1:23:42|Following that, [A Di] aimed his gun at [Hua Tian], pulling the trigger and hitting his shoulder. The burly [Bao Zhu] then dragged in Xi Gui, who was feeling somewhat helpless amidst the sudden internal conflict.
1:23:42|1:23:53|And piles of gold bars were all stuffed into the backpack by [Bao Zhu], while [Ma Da] and [Tai Ping] stood dumbfounded on the side without daring to speak. [Bao Zhu] stuffed bags filled with gold bars into the trunk of the car one by one.
1:23:54|1:24:11|[Hua Tian], who was gritting his teeth in pain, hesitated to move forward in the face of [A Di]'s gun. [Bao Zhu], who had loaded the gold bars, approached and gave a thumbs-up gesture to [A Di]. Then he pushed [Ma Da] aside and took the gold bars on the table behind him. Suddenly, he was drenched in liquid gold.
1:24:21|1:24:26|[Tai Ping] and [Ma Da] immediately picked up the pistol on the side and started shooting at them, [Hua Tian] and others had no intention of letting them go.
1:24:27|1:24:42|[A Di] was the first to turn around and shoot [Tai Ping], while He Xikui dragged her towards the car. As Hua Tian arrived and raised his gun to shoot, [A Di] and He Xikui could only crouch in front of the car. Meanwhile, the ignored [Bao Zhu] was engulfed in flames, causing the liquefied gas to explode.
1:24:45|1:24:52|A huge explosion engulfed in smoke and dust from all directions, [A Di] took the opportunity to reach into the trunk and pull out a bundle of gold bars.
1:24:54|1:25:2|In the corner, [Hua Tian] fired several shots but failed to hit the target, while Xi Gui stepped forward to take A Di away. [Hua Tian] in the corner shouted.
1:25:4|1:25:14|Xi Gui peeked out and saw Ma Da and his men approaching with guns in hand. The firelight illuminated their faces. Hua Tian and Tai Ping cautiously moved forward with their pistols raised.
1:25:16|1:25:24|The warehouse door was suddenly blown open, followed by the SWAT team in standard gear rushing in, causing the criminals to tense up immediately.
1:25:27|1:25:44|At this moment, [Tai Ping] said, "Whether it's gold bars or grudges, as long as the green hills remain, we're not afraid of running out of firewood." [Hua Tian] slung his backpack over his shoulder and walked out first. Tai Ping and Ma Da destroyed the evidence, threw the handguns into the fire pit, then moved a steel plate aside, revealing an underground passage. [Tai Ping] went in first.
1:25:44|1:25:55|[A Di] is covering the wounded Xi Gui, and the two are hiding behind an empty oil drum. [A Di] looks out at the special police outside. The special police team is holding flashlights and carrying submachine guns as they rush in.
1:25:55|1:26:11|[A Di] took the initiative, and the special police immediately fought back. The sound of gunfire became more and more intense. He Xikui was unwilling to be caught and removed the wooden board in the corner, which unexpectedly led to the outside. At the same time, [Hua Tian], who was shot, was carrying a large bag of gold bars and hurriedly limped forward.
1:26:11|1:26:28|Not long after, a wooden board on the corner window was removed by Xi Gui, creating a passable hole. Gasping for breath, Xi Gui grabbed A Di's hand and beckoned. He first threw the gold bars out of the window, then climbed out. A Di kept a close eye on the SWAT team. Meanwhile, Hua Tian, who had escaped from the warehouse, was already exhausted from being shot.
1:26:28|1:26:41|The big bag of gold bars became too heavy to carry, so he used all his wits to get to the port. Before boarding the ship, he saw the patrol boat of the special police. For a moment, he hesitated. The special police team in the warehouse also approached at this time.
1:26:41|1:26:48|Alone at the port, [Hua Tian] faced the fully armed special police, dropped his bag, raised his hands, and slowly knelt down.
1:26:49|1:27:2|The special police officers ran up and successfully subdued him, and the cold handcuffs finally landed on his wrists. [Hua Tian] looked pained, but had no choice. Afterwards, the boss expressed dissatisfaction.
1:28:8|1:28:13|Li Cangdong, who was caught in the middle, was particularly heartbroken and couldn't understand his boss's behavior.
1:28:14|1:28:25|After the boss finished speaking, [Li Cangdong] was left standing there, his expression filled with extreme pain. He hunched over, furrowing his brow, feeling as if a heavy stone was pressing down on his chest, making it difficult for him to breathe.
1:28:25|1:28:44|However, the escaped [A Di] and Xi Gui are currently hiding in a dimly lit basement. The walls of the room are particularly mottled, with only a bed and a set of table and chairs inside. Xi Gui is lying on the bed seemingly unconscious. [A Di] is helping him clean his wounds, the intense pain causing his pale lips to tremble uncontrollably.
1:28:44|1:28:49|After cleaning the wound, [A Di] wrapped it with gauze for him, and at that moment, thunder could be heard in the sky.
1:28:51|1:29:4|In a corner of the bustling city streets, a car is parked, and the person inside is the harried [Li Cangdong]. He reclines the driver's seat, lying down with his eyes closed to relax. At this moment, a taxi pulls up beside him.
1:29:4|1:29:25|The person in the car got out and walked straight towards the hospital building. [Li Cangdong] in the car immediately became alert, he got out of the car and looked towards the hospital entrance. Then, he closed the car door and took a few steps forward, muttering to himself as he looked across the street at the hospital entrance. Unfortunately, things did not go as planned.
1:29:25|1:29:35|The man who walked out from the transparent glass door had an extremely painful expression. He stood quietly at the doorway as if his feet were frozen, but his facial features were twisted in sadness.
1:29:35|1:29:50|He looked up and saw [Li Cangdong], immediately covering his forehead and crying. [Li Cangdong]'s ex-wife died despite the rescue efforts, and how could he across the street not understand this scene? He just frowned, turned around, and slowly walked towards the car.
1:29:50|1:30:10|The car was speeding on the highway, [Li Cangdong] under the black-framed glasses was filled with indescribable sadness. Tears slid from the corners of his eyes down his cheeks, as he tightly clenched his mouth to prevent any sound from escaping. He knew better than anyone else that all of this was his own fault. Hot tears welled up in his eyes, and suddenly his gaze became resolute.
1:30:10|1:30:26|With one hand on the steering wheel, he unbuckled his seatbelt. Then, both hands left the wheel, raised in surrender. The car slammed fiercely into the stone pillar on the roadside, shattered windshield and raised hood, telling the pain in Li Cangdong's heart.
1:30:26|1:30:32|The steering wheel on the outside, the deformed seat, and the misshapen airbag envelop [Li Cangdong].
1:30:32|1:30:56|Smoke or hot air was billowing out from the engine hood, while inside the car, [Li Cangdong] lay sprawled, his face covered in shards of glass. In the midst of danger, he exerted all his strength to slowly lift his head, desperately trying to sit up from the collapsed body in the seat. Propping his waist with his elbow, he finally managed to sit up. This was his self-punishment. Leaning against the seat, he furrowed his brow, squinting as he looked ahead.
1:30:56|1:31:4|The suicide-style car crash did not end his life, the death of his ex-wife and the dilemma of the informant's advance and retreat are both tormenting his heart.
1:31:5|1:31:17|Perhaps it was the will of heaven to leave him in the world to complete his unfinished task. Tears rolled down from the corners of his eyes, and his glasses had long been knocked off to an unknown location. Just then, a phone call came in.
1:31:24|1:31:30|The body, filled with pain, could hardly move, and the heart, riddled with wounds, couldn't muster any enthusiasm.
1:31:31|1:31:44|The phone kept ringing incessantly, and he had no choice but to answer the call. He put the phone to his ear. [Xi Gui] endured the pain in his body.
1:31:46|1:31:55|He supported the wound on his waist with his hand. Inside the cottage, [Xi Gui] looked around and caught sight of the doorplate in the corner, stating the address.
1:31:57|1:32:13|After hanging up the phone, he struggled to crawl to the bed with his injured body. The wound on his waist was occasionally pulled, almost causing him to kneel on the bed. Fortunately, [A Di] returned in time and hurried forward.
1:32:14|1:32:27|She supported [Xi Gui]'s heavy body and struggled to climb onto the bed. Sweat had unknowingly seeped out of [Xi Gui]'s forehead, his eyes were a bit unfocused, and [A Di] helped him sit up.
1:32:28|1:32:46|[Xi Gui] tremblingly took out a ring from his pocket, slowly raising it up to show [A Di]. [A Di] looked at the bloody palm, eyes widened, unable to speak for a moment. How could she have expected that [Xi Gui] really helped her get back this ring.
1:32:46|1:32:53|[Xi Gui] watched her struggling to catch her breath, and after she adjusted her breathing, she told her the truth of the matter.
1:32:57|1:33:11|[A Di] stared at him in astonishment. At that moment, [A Di] looked at him with pity.
1:33:14|1:33:20|A Di calmed down his emotions, slowly lifted his head, and looked firmly at Xi Gui, saying.
1:33:24|1:33:30|Xi Gui's lips trembled as he stared at her.
1:33:38|1:33:52|And at this moment, the stubborn A Di, with tears welling up in his eyes, fought back the tears. [Xi Gui] trembled as she touched A Di's cheek with shaking hands, then her hand dropped down. A Di knelt on the bed, supporting [Xi Gui].
1:33:55|1:34:0|A Di worked hard to help Xi Gui turn over, letting him lie on his side on the bed.
1:34:1|1:34:18|Next, he pulled up the quilt and covered him, while [Xi Gui] lay on his side, tears rolling down his pillow at some point. Then, he slowly closed his eyes. This night, too many people found it hard to fall asleep, a table lamp lighting up a corner of the living room.
1:34:18|1:34:30|Under the light, [Li Cangdong] sat with bandages on his head. The shards of glass on his face had been cleaned up, but the fresh blood on the wound was still shocking. He seemed to have made a decision.
1:34:30|1:34:47|In front of the safe, he took out a key and turned the lock, then pressed numbers on the keypad. With a beep, the safe opened, revealing stacks of cash. [Li Cangdong] took out a prepared document bag and stuffed the piles of cash into it.
1:34:47|1:35:1|He is seeking redemption for his life. Early that day, in a remote village, the sound of birds could be heard, and a ray of morning light shone through the window onto the iron bed frame. Sitting on a chair beside the bed was [A Di], who seemed to have kept watch all night.
1:35:1|1:35:17|Watching Xi Gui curling up in pain, Hua Tian got up impatiently and went to the phone, dialing the doctor's number. She urgently pressed the receiver to her ear, trying hard to calm her breathing.
1:35:20|1:35:37|At the entrance of the village, the doctor did come, but he was not alone. Tai Ping took out a stack of cash from his pocket and handed it to the doctor. Unaware, the two were still waiting for treatment in the room, while Tai Ping and his group had quietly approached.
1:35:37|1:35:43|About six or seven people in this group quickly entered the urban village, with [Tai Ping] leading the way, looking at the house numbers as he walked.
1:35:44|1:35:55|The old alleyways resembled slums, with some paths so narrow that only one person could pass through at a time. However, this did not deter [Tai Ping] in the slightest. Compared to a heavy gold bar, these difficulties were insignificant.
1:35:56|1:36:17|Soon, the farmhouse was found. Just as there was a sound of someone unlocking the door outside, [A Di] on the chair impatiently got up and opened the door. However, the door outside was a security door, while the one [A Di] opened was a small wooden door. [A Di] shot through the door towards the outside, and the fat man outside was shot and fell to the ground.
1:36:17|1:36:22|With injuries on his body, Xi Gui finally climbed over the window but fell to the ground.
1:36:23|1:36:36|Outside the window is a narrow gap. Xi Gui is struggling to move forward, leaning against the wall. A Di rushes over to help him, but the corridor is too narrow, so he can only support Xi Gui from behind. The two quickly pass through the narrow alley and arrive at the crisscrossing small path.
1:36:36|1:36:53|The two panicked individuals could only run forward, with [Tai Ping] and others closely chasing after them. However, when they turned into an alley, [A Di] accidentally fell down, and Xi Gui quickly helped her up. In just a few seconds, [Tai Ping] had caught up, jumping up and fiercely swinging his knife, striking Xi Gui in the back.
1:36:53|1:37:5|[A Di] hurriedly helped Xi Gui up, but there was no way out in front of them. Just then, they heard the barking of a dog and an old woman opened the door. Without much thought, Xi Gui rushed straight into the old woman's house, with [A Di] following closely behind.
1:38:10|1:38:23|He [Xi Gui] no longer waits passively, he picks up a chair from the corridor and walks towards the gangsters. As he approaches, he raises his hand and smashes it down, while the gangsters also swing their knives, trying to seriously injure him. Soon, the outnumbered Xi Gui is defeated.
1:38:23|1:38:34|He sat on the ground, propped up his body, hurriedly dodged backwards, and grabbed the nearby tables and chairs to block the robbers. [A Di] watched anxiously, desperately shaking the long-unused iron gate.
1:38:34|1:38:46|Finally, the door opened. The bandit crossed over the obstacles of tables and chairs, heading towards Xi Gui. In desperation, Xi Gui picked up a wooden board from the ground and smashed it towards the bandit. Just as the bandit was about to strike with his knife, A Di rushed in and grabbed a sharp wooden board.
1:38:46|1:38:53|Stabbed in the abdomen. On the other side, [Li Cangdong] who walked out of the house discovered the blood on the ground, so he ran along the bloodstains.
1:38:53|1:39:4|Seeing the cowardly lackeys falling one by one, [Tai Ping] personally took up a machete and entered the scene. The two of them passed through the small door and pulled the latch behind them. Meanwhile, [Xi Gui] arrived at the back door intending to break in, while [A Di] discovered that the gold bars were missing.
1:39:6|1:39:11|Impatient [A Di] crawled to the ground and reached towards the torn hole under the door to grab the backpack.
1:39:32|1:39:42|Xi Gui stuffed A Di in, but was viciously slashed from behind by Ma Da who had rushed over. Xi Gui seemed to be on his last legs, but he turned around and kicked Ma Da down.
1:39:43|1:39:50|In the final moments, he still hoped that [A Di] could successfully escape. Furious, [Tai Ping] rushed over trying to pull out [Xi Gui].
1:39:50|1:40:1|But Xi Gui held onto the wooden door tightly for A Di, buying him time, while Tai Ping swung his knife down, landing on Xi Gui's head. A Di, heartbroken, stopped running and ran towards Xi Gui.
1:40:1|1:40:12|At this moment, [Li Cangdong] also ran towards the sound of screams and, seeing [Ma Da] just getting up at the door, he directly pounced forward and pulled him down. Meanwhile, [Xi Gui] was wedged against the door, her body involuntarily convulsing.
1:40:14|1:40:19|[Li Cangdong] threw [Ma Da] to the ground and smashed a chair on him, while [Tai Ping] entered the room and walked aggressively towards [A Di].
1:40:19|1:40:36|[Adi], who was retreating step by step, felt a piece of glass on the windowsill. Without any warning, he slashed [Tai Ping]'s cheek in a fit of rage. Seizing the opportunity, [Adi] continued to stab [Tai Ping]'s belly several times. As [Tai Ping] regained his senses, he smashed the glass with a knife, but the knife slipped from his hand.
1:40:36|1:40:50|In a classroom separated by a door, [Li Cangdong] was ambushed by [Ma Da] and fell to the ground. [Ma Da] mounted on top of [Li Cangdong], waving his fists, but [Li Cangdong] took the opportunity to throw him off to the side, then flipped over to mount on top of [Ma Da], tightly gripping his neck with both hands.
1:40:50|1:41:0|[Ma Da] looked pained, his eyes bulging, yet his hand found a brick on the ground. He then tightly gripped the brick and swung it, smashing it onto the unprepared head of [Li Cangdong].
1:41:0|1:41:15|[Li Cangdong] took the opportunity to catch his breath and, lying on the ground, he also found a brick to smash on [Ma Da]'s head. [Li Cangdong] struggled to get up, swung his arm and struck again. In another room, [A Di] reached out to gouge out [Tai Ping]'s eyeballs.
1:41:15|1:41:23|Tai Ping, in pain, grabbed A Di's injured arm. Ma Da outside the house had been hit on the head several times and had lost consciousness.
1:41:23|1:41:38|The weary Li Cangdong slowly and laboriously got up, only to see that the informant stuck in the door crack had long stopped moving. He hurried over and crouched by the informant's ear. But at this moment, Hexi Kui still did not regain consciousness.
1:41:40|1:41:45|His face was covered in blood, just staring at the window with his eyes wide open, already dead.
1:42:49|1:42:57|At a critical moment, [A Di], who had regained consciousness, grabbed the bag containing gold bars and viciously smashed it onto [Tai Ping]'s head. [Tai Ping] fell to the ground with blood coming out of his mouth and nose.
1:42:58|1:43:11|Exhausted, [A Di] leaned back in the chair, breathing heavily. A corner of a gold bar peeked out from the black messenger bag on the floor, while [Tai Ping] convulsed in a pool of blood. Seeing this, [Li Cangdong] finally breathed a sigh of relief and lay down.
1:43:11|1:43:23|[A Di] noticed that the dead He Xi Kui at the door was staring in this direction with wide eyes. She crawled past Tai Ping's body towards He Xi Kui, who was seriously injured, and every step she took was extremely difficult.
1:43:23|1:43:36|[Li Cangdong] at this point also eased up and tried to get up. [A Di], who had crawled to the door, was holding Xi Gui's face, which was already covered in blood. She struggled to prop herself up, leaning her head against the door, and couldn't help but cry.
1:43:37|1:43:43|She gently touched Xi Kui's face with her hands covered in mud, but never received a response.
1:43:45|1:44:3|The person who gave her warmth died in front of her like this. [A Di] trembled lips, tears falling non-stop. If it wasn't for her impulsive decision, for that bag of gold, perhaps [Xi Gui] still had a chance. Unfortunately, there are no "ifs", and no amount of regretful tears can change what has already happened.
1:44:3|1:44:7|Li Cangdong finally struggled to get up and looked at the two people in front of him.
1:44:8|1:44:23|[Li Cangdong] propped himself up, feeling uneasy, as [A Di] gently shook [Xi Gui], hoping for a response. Eventually, he leaned against the wall, clutching his briefcase, and limped away from the scene.
1:44:24|1:44:32|The staggering figure seemed to be resentful of fate's mockery, the determined 1 million in the bag ultimately failed to be handed over to Xi Gui.
1:44:33|1:44:43|Before long, the police arrived at the scene. Seeing [Ma Da] lying in the corner with blood all over his face was truly shocking. A young police officer led the way to the door.
1:44:56|1:45:11|The zipper of the black body bag was slowly pulled up, and another informant paid with his life. The lights of the city still shone, but the colors gradually faded to black and white. The deceased rest in peace, while the living still have to face the future of their lives.
1:45:11|1:45:25|That day, a car broke the quiet of the night, slowed down as it entered the alley, and the person waiting there was none other than [Li Cangdong]. His head was wrapped in bandages, his arm in a cast, and he held a briefcase in his other hand.
1:45:25|1:45:34|A car stopped in front of him, and a bald, scar-faced fat man got out. [Li Cangdong] picked up the briefcase and handed it to him.
1:45:47|1:45:54|[Li Cangdong] takes out a stack of cash. At this moment, [Li Cangdong] frowns.
1:45:55|1:46:1|He stared fiercely at the bald man. Later, the injured [Li Cangdong] arrived at a nightclub.
