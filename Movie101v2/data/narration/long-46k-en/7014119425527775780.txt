0:1:36|0:1:48|Zhao Mosheng looked up to see a police officer walking onto the deck with a serious expression. She quickly pretended to admire the scenery, blending in with the tourists along the railing. [Zhao Mosheng] took off a nearby tourist's hat, then casually took the sunglasses from a seat to disguise herself.
0:1:55|0:2:9|The photographer quietly agreed, raised the camera to take a photo of [Zhao Mosheng], who was fixing her appearance while facing the sea, striking various poses. [Zhao Mosheng] turned her face to the side and made a scissor hand gesture. On the stairs not far away, [He Yichen] was holding the handrail and making a phone call.
0:2:9|0:2:26|The boat slowly sailed on the sea near Devil's Island, a book emerged in the darkness, and the title gradually appeared in gold letters: "He Yichen and Zhao Mosheng". On the watercolor painting of the book, a girl in a blue dress stood at the bow of the boat, sailing towards the Oriental Pearl.
0:2:26|0:2:32|In 2015 in Shanghai, Zhao Mosheng, with a fiery temper, raised her fists and pounded on the door.
0:2:34|0:2:51|No one responded in the room. She lowered her head to look at the watch, then decided to push open the door. [Zhao Mosheng] rushed into the room, angrily pulling open the curtains.
0:3:30|0:3:38|The Flower Fairy threw the towel onto [Zhao Mosheng]'s head, then walked out in big strides. [Zhao Mosheng], leaning against the mirror, stood up straight, took off the towel from her head, and rubbed her hair with both hands as she looked at herself in the mirror.
0:4:2|0:4:22|[Zhao Mosheng] walked out of the room in a smart leather jacket, then entered the studio. Handing her bag to the stylist, [Zhao Mosheng] walked to the tripod to adjust the camera. A female model in a sparkling skirt gracefully posed in front of the white backdrop, and [Zhao Mosheng] skillfully picked up the camera to start working.
0:4:23|0:4:41|At night, [Zhao Mosheng] gets out of a taxi and arrives at the entrance of a food supermarket. Outside the supermarket, there are English signs and advertisements. [Zhao Mosheng] walks into the store with a red handbag, lifts her hand to adjust her hair, turns into the left merchandise area, while not far away on the right, [He Yichen] and Yi Mei are checking out at the cashier.
0:4:48|0:5:7|Zhao Mosheng pushed the shopping cart and walked around the shelves. She walked out of the beverage area and stopped next to the pile of Jasmine tea, staring blankly at the rest area in front of her. Next to the small round table in the rest area, He Yichen and Yi Mei were drinking coffee. Zhao Mosheng's eyes looked nervous and evasive.
0:5:11|0:5:49|The shopping cart knocked down the stack of beverages, and the supermarket staff rushed out. Zhao Mosheng stood up abruptly, [He Yichen] picked up the coat on the back of the chair and followed Mei's gaze. His eyes widened instantly. Zhao Mosheng stood up with the shopping cart, looking to the side. [He Yichen] stared straight at her, their eyes met. Tears welled up in Zhao Mosheng's eyes, while He Yichen's eyes turned red but then lowered. His gaze shifted to the table.
0:6:0|0:6:24|[He Yichen] calmly walked out of the store, took a quick glance at Zhao Mosheng, picked up the shopping bag and chased after her. Zhao Mosheng stood still, watching the two of them leave, seeming to breathe a sigh of relief. As she walked out of the store, the security guard stopped her and opened her wallet, saying,
0:6:26|0:6:36|In the transparent compartment of the wallet, there is a one-inch photo of Zhao Mosheng with short hair. She takes out the photo and flips it to the back, where "mysunshine" is written in black pen.
0:6:37|0:6:52|Zhao Mosheng was stunned, she would never forget that handwriting, it was [He Yichen]'s handwriting. In the photography studio, the staff were busy with their work, and the Flower Fairy excitedly explained to Zhao Mosheng.
0:7:13|0:7:27|Xiao Xiao walked in with a pair of staff members, and Hua Xianzi quickly greeted her with a smile. Xiao Xiao skillfully posed in front of the white cloth backdrop, while the computer screen next to her displayed the photos taken in real time. Xiao Xiao looked elegant and charming in the photos, but suddenly Zhao Mosheng stopped shooting.
0:7:36|0:7:45|In the nightclub, men and women dressed provocatively swayed to the music. Sitting at a booth, Xiao Xiao flirtatiously approached Zhao Mosheng.
0:8:29|0:9:0|Zhao Mosheng lowered her eyes, and Xiao Xiao shook out everything from the bag on the table. She picked up a business card and slapped it in front of Zhao Mosheng. Zhao Mosheng looked at the card, which read "Yuan Xiang Law Firm: [He Yichen] Lawyer." Zhao Mosheng arrived at the entrance of the Shanghai Global Financial Center, a tall building standing among skyscrapers, reaching into the clouds. A tall man in a suit knocked on He Yichen's office door.
0:9:0|0:9:10|William, with a green side-parted hairstyle, walked in carrying a water cup. He placed the cup and medicine on the table, and also added a wallet.
0:9:18|0:9:32|William walked out of the office, [He Yichen] looked at his wallet thoughtfully, the transparent compartment inside the wallet was empty. In the studio, the Flower Fairy quickly walked to [Zhao Mosheng]'s side and gave her a hard pat on the back.
0:9:37|0:9:52|[Zhao Mosheng] came to the corridor, and the handsome man standing with his back to her in front of the floor-to-ceiling window turned out to be [He Yichen]. When [He Yichen] turned around, his face slightly against the light, but she could still see his indifferent expression. [Zhao Mosheng] looked at him, unable to catch her breath, unable to speak.
0:9:52|0:10:4|[He Yichen] frowned slightly, exuding a more intimidating aura than before. [Zhao Mosheng] gathered her courage and walked towards him, while [He Yichen] calmly looked at her.
0:10:48|0:10:57|He Yichen took a few steps and then stopped, slowly turning around to look at Zhao Mosheng. He Yichen's gaze was deep, and the two remained silent for a while.
0:11:18|0:11:28|[Zhao Mosheng] frowned in anger, about to say something. However, [He Yichen] decisively turned his head and walked away, not waiting for the automatic glass door to open fully before swiftly walking down the stairs.
0:11:28|0:11:39|[Zhao Mosheng] turned around and stood alone in place for a long time. She sat on a chair in front of the colorful glass wall in the corridor, quietly looking at the ground, tears unknowingly sliding out of her eyes.
0:11:40|0:12:2|Memories come flooding back. On the university campus, [Zhao Mosheng] stands in front of the teaching building, holding a camera. After taking a photo, she looks at the screen and then checks her watch. Hurriedly, she looks towards the entrance of the building, where [He Yichen] and a group of male classmates walk out with books. After bidding farewell to his friends, he walks ahead alone. Seizing the opportunity, [Zhao Mosheng] frantically presses the shutter button. [He Yichen] turns his head and catches sight of her.
0:12:15|0:12:23|[He Yichen] didn't expect this villain to file a complaint first, feeling both amused and exasperated. He then walked away without a word, with [Zhao Mosheng] catching up and asking,
0:12:47|0:12:53|[He Yichen] stopped and looked at [Zhao Mosheng] with a speechless expression.
0:13:1|0:13:11|He Yichen was speechless in the face of the opponent who didn't follow the rules. Zhao Mosheng heard the rumors and quickly ran to find He Yichen with a camera in hand.
0:13:21|0:13:27|He Yichen turned around and took Zhao Mosheng's camera.
0:13:33|0:13:43|He Yichen focuses the camera on [Zhao Mosheng], who looks stunned in the frame. In the office, He Yichen withdraws from his memories, closes his eyes, and caresses the wallet in his hand.
0:13:43|0:13:58|Two people in camouflage suddenly rushed in, squatting beside He Yichen. One of them put his arm around He Yichen's shoulder, while the other one placed a model gun on the table.
0:14:20|0:14:26|Lao Yuan and Xiang Heng high-fived each other in perfect harmony.
0:14:35|0:14:43|He Yichen opened the medicine box, just picked up the water cup and was held back by William. William took the water cup from He Yichen's hand and turned away.
0:14:47|0:14:57|He Yichen opened the pink candy box sent by William, inside was a photo of [Zhao Mosheng], along with a few candies. He took one and put it in his mouth, then spat it out.
0:15:2|0:15:22|He Yichen picked up a durian candy and fell into memories. On the university campus lawn, Zhao Mosheng suddenly appeared and leaned against He Yichen. He opened the round candy box, peeled one and put it in his mouth, but then immediately took it out to smell it.
0:15:25|0:15:35|He Yichen opened another candy and brought it close to his nose. Zhao Mosheng deliberately slapped the candy box onto He Yichen's face.
0:15:46|0:15:56|He Yichen tickled Zhao Mosheng around her waist, and the two playfully kissed each other. Suddenly, He Yichen pulled away from Zhao Mosheng's lips, with a piece of candy in his mouth. He screamed and fell to the side, while Zhao Mosheng grabbed his arm.
0:16:4|0:16:10|He Yichen looked at her while biting on the candy. He Yichen painfully put the candy into his mouth, then pushed it to the middle of his front teeth and bit down on it.
0:16:48|0:17:6|He Yichen seemed lost in thought, lying face to face under a tree with scattered durian candies and pink petals strewn around. In the office of Xiu Se magazine, the Flower Fairy pushed Zhao Mosheng to sit in front of the dressing table.
0:17:38|0:18:8|Hua Xianzi pushed aside Zhao Mosheng's explosion head wig, added cat ears to her black-framed glasses, and Zhao Mosheng raised her glasses, following Hua Xianzi out of the magazine office. Hua Xianzi rushed to get chewing gum, leaving Zhao Mosheng awkwardly standing there adjusting her hair. She pushed up her glasses and suddenly saw a man leaning against a white car on the side of the road. The man looked up and met her gaze, it was He Yichen.
0:18:9|0:18:30|[Zhao Mosheng] stood there with her right hand covering her face, looking at him blankly. [He Yichen] stared at the exaggerated outfit of [Zhao Mosheng] and couldn't help but chuckle. [Zhao Mosheng] awkwardly tugged at her clothes, causing [He Yichen] to suppress a smile and shift his gaze slightly. [Zhao Mosheng] ran her fingers through her hair, revealing a stunning and elegant beauty in front of him.
0:19:16|0:19:47|The beautiful woman smiled at [Zhao Mosheng], then turned and sat in the passenger seat next to [He Yichen]. The flower fairy ran up and waved her arms at the departing car, while below the residential building, [Zhao Mosheng] carried a wig with an explosion head to the mailbox. Next to the mailbox was the entrance to the building. [Zhao Mosheng] held the wig to her chest and walked into the hallway. The dim light in the hallway only illuminated the flower pots next to the spiral staircase. [Zhao Mosheng] scratched the back of her head, and wearily climbed the spiral staircase.
0:19:50|0:20:11|Vintage paper bags hung by the glass window on the wall, filled with small flowers. Suddenly, someone rushed up from behind [Zhao Mosheng], and as soon as [Zhao Mosheng] saw [He Yichen]'s face, he pulled her into his arms. Without hesitation, [He Yichen] pushed [Zhao Mosheng] against the glass window, held her face, pressed his lips against hers, and quickly unbuttoned her coat. The fiery kiss spread to her shoulders as he held [Zhao Mosheng]'s wrists.
0:20:11|0:20:37|[He Yichen] did not stop, he continued to kiss [Zhao Mosheng]'s shoulder with a confused and infatuated look. Taking a deep breath, he finally stopped. His head buried in [Zhao Mosheng]'s neck, he grabbed her collar with a hoarse voice. Trembling slightly, [Zhao Mosheng] asked anxiously,
0:20:42|0:21:8|Disheveled hair covered half of [Zhao Mosheng]'s face, [He Yichen] slowly moved away from her shoulder, his nose touching hers, gazing deeply at her. After a while, [He Yichen] took a deep breath, stood up straight, half of his face in shadow, his eyes flashing with distress and anger in the darkness. [Zhao Mosheng] leaned against the window, looking at him in confusion, while [He Yichen]'s eyebrows twitched slightly, his eyes turning red, and his lips tightly pressed together.
0:21:10|0:21:19|He Yichen fixed his gaze on [Zhao Mosheng]'s eyes, as if trying to see something from them. He turned around and walked down two flights of stairs, leaning against the glass window before unsteadily making his way downstairs and leaving.
0:21:21|0:21:38|[Zhao Mosheng] saw her pink handbag lying quietly on the stairs in front of her, matching her outfit. She touched her nose and then covered her lips. If it weren't for the slight pain on her lips, she would have thought it was a ridiculous dream. The Oriental Pearl Tower shone against the surrounding skyscrapers.
0:21:38|0:22:6|The lights dimmed and the sky gradually brightened. [Zhao Mosheng], wearing a beige scarf, walked out of the residential building. She glanced at the morning street, deserted with only a row of cars parked along the side, disappearing into the distance. Facing the sun, she walked onto the bridge. Suddenly, her gaze froze, and her steps slowed down. [He Yichen] leaned against the bridge railing not far away. Sensing someone approaching, he slowly raised his eyes, locking his gaze on [Zhao Mosheng].
0:22:7|0:22:16|[Zhao Mosheng] did not refuse. In the corridor of the Law School at Huangpu University, [He Yichen] and [Zhao Mosheng] walked towards a lecture hall that was in session.
0:22:21|0:22:45|A female student ran into the classroom, pulling the two of them into memories. The professor's words made everyone burst into laughter, with [Zhao Mosheng] laughing heartily by [He Yichen]'s side.
0:22:52|0:23:0|[Zhao Mosheng] stood up helplessly in front of everyone, pulling on [He Yichen]'s sleeve. Surprisingly, [He Yichen] said stiffly,
0:23:1|0:23:10|The surrounding classmates all chuckled secretly, and [He Yichen] instantly lost his composure. Someone shouted,
0:23:28|0:23:35|[Zhao Mosheng] covered her face with one hand and pulled [He Yichen]'s clothes to lift him up.
0:23:50|0:24:3|Classmates clapped and laughed loudly, while the two stood silently with their heads down, becoming the center of attention in the classroom. Now, standing outside the classroom door, everything seemed like yesterday. [He Yichen] said,
0:24:8|0:24:35|Zhao Mosheng stared at him blankly, the soft light through the window casting a gentle glow on his face, his features calm and mild. [He Yichen] turned his face to the side, and Zhao Mosheng quickly averted her gaze. At night, Zhao Mosheng and [He Yichen] walked side by side down the bridge. As they reached the wet streets in front of the residential building, Zhao Mosheng stopped in her tracks. She stood in front of [He Yichen], turned slightly towards the building, took a small step back, and said,
0:24:35|0:24:57|[He Yichen] remained silent as Zhao Mosheng turned and walked slowly to the center of the road, then stopped. She clasped her hands together, bowed her head in thought, and turned back to look silently at [He Yichen]. He stood with his hands in his pockets, and as soon as Zhao Mosheng turned back, he immediately walked towards her. His eyes were red as he looked at Zhao Mosheng, then gazed into the distance beyond her. After a while, he finally spoke,
0:25:6|0:25:16|[He Yichen] lowered his head, his cold lips touching her forehead. Zhao Mosheng was startled and took a step back, but [He Yichen] just touched her and then walked away, striding up the ramp of the bridge.
0:25:17|0:25:30|Zhao Mosheng took a deep breath as she watched his retreating figure under the street lamp, the figure on the PPT at the Xiu Se magazine office turned into [He Yichen].
0:26:36|0:26:52|[He Yichen] handed the cotton candy to [Zhao Mosheng], took off his scarf and tied it around her neck, pulled her into his arms, memories fading away. [Zhao Mosheng] wiped away the tears that fell silently. In the airport lobby, the lawyers walked towards Xiao Xiao and [Zhao Mosheng], arms open wide, but Xiao Xiao sidestepped.
0:27:28|0:27:42|Xiao Xiao brought Zhao Mosheng and [He Yichen] together, hugging them for a silent farewell. In the neon lights of the city night, Xiang Heng adjusted the rearview mirror while driving and sneakily glanced at Zhao Mosheng and [He Yichen] in the back seat, suddenly grinning.
0:28:4|0:28:21|[He Yichen] was impatient. Zhao Mosheng turned her face to look at him. The car stopped by the roadside green belt, coincidentally next to a no parking sign. [He Yichen] got out of the car, walked to the side of the car, opened the door, and pulled Zhao Mosheng's hand to pull her out of the car.
0:28:23|0:28:28|Zhao Mosheng was pulled by [He Yichen] as they walked on the pedestrian overpass.
0:29:14|0:29:22|The long-held beliefs were completely overturned, leaving [Zhao Mosheng] in a state of confusion.
0:29:36|0:30:4|[He Yichen] stared at [Zhao Mosheng] with burning eyes, his desperate and angry questioning tone leaving [Zhao Mosheng] speechless. [Zhao Mosheng] lowered her eyes, unable to look at him, and after a while she managed to say something. [He Yichen] turned his face away, wiped the tears from the corner of his eyes with his wrist. [Zhao Mosheng] kept her head down. Then [He Yichen] turned back, his eyes red, looking at her.
0:30:7|0:30:16|[Zhao Mosheng] stared at [He Yichen] in astonishment with teary eyes, while [He Yichen] looked at her steadily. Soon, [Zhao Mosheng] lowered her head timidly and said,
0:30:17|0:30:52|He Yichen couldn't even give Zhao Mosheng courage. A tear silently slid down Zhao Mosheng's cheek. He Yichen took a deep breath, abruptly stopped drawing, and asked. Zhao Mosheng lowered her eyes and pursed her lips. He Yichen's face was cold and gloomy, his voice filled with despair. Zhao Mosheng closed her eyes as if avoiding, but tears uncontrollably fell down.
0:30:52|0:31:5|Tears gathered on He Yichen's chin, the despair in his eyes almost engulfing Zhao Mosheng, as if this love was irretrievable, and the whole world collapsed around him.
0:31:5|0:31:24|On a stormy night with lightning and thunder, [He Yichen] stood by the French window looking outside, childhood memories flooding back. At the age of 10, [He Yichen] stood in front of a construction site where workers gathered, witnessing his father in a suit falling from the building. His mother threw away the lunchbox and knelt beside his father. His aunt said to him,
0:31:41|0:31:49|A newspaper appeared in He Yichen's mind, featuring the Zhao couple on the front page with the headline "Deputy Mayor Visits Welfare Home for Elderly Widows".
0:32:48|0:33:19|[He Yichen] forcefully shook off [Zhao Mosheng]'s hand, turned decisively and walked away, then ran out of [Zhao Mosheng]'s sight. [Zhao Mosheng] stood alone in the swirling snow, staring blankly at the direction where [He Yichen] disappeared. Clad in a white down jacket, [Zhao Mosheng] gradually blended into the snow, the high-rise buildings on both sides of the Bund were tinted red by the sunset, cruise ships quietly sailed on the river, and in the boxing gym, Xiang Heng wearing a headgear knocked down his opponent. [Zhao Mosheng] stood not far away and seemed to recognize him.
0:33:19|0:33:25|He Yichen noticed the gaze and looked at [Zhao Mosheng], who took off her helmet.
0:34:29|0:34:46|Zhao Mosheng sat there, stunned by the news. She arrived at the hospital, and the glass door opened automatically. She hurried to the nurse's station. He Yichen, wearing a fluffy coat, happened to come down the stairs. He Yichen slowed down his pace upon seeing Zhao Mosheng, and the two stared at each other directly.
0:34:54|0:35:7|Zhao Mosheng looked at He Yichen on the sickbed, and upon hearing this explanation, Zhao Mosheng turned her face slightly.
0:35:56|0:36:4|He Yichen took a small step back, lowered his head and sighed lightly as if making a decision, then looked at Zhao Mosheng and confessed.
0:36:22|0:36:36|She chuckled self-deprecatingly, Zhao Mosheng remembered the day before her 19th birthday. Zhao Mosheng placed the Fat Tiger figurine in front of He Yichen, who swallowed nervously.
0:37:18|0:37:26|He Yichen stood up with tears in his eyes.
0:37:42|0:38:4|He Yichen supported the dazed He Yichen with his hands, his hands on He Yichen's waist, leaning his face on his shoulder, the street lamp illuminating the tears on He Yichen's face.
0:38:12|0:38:34|He Yichen staggered forward, snowflakes falling on him, making him appear even more lonely. In this moment, He Yichen suddenly realized that his recovery was only superficial, while the emotional wounds had already penetrated deep into his bones. He broke free from Zhao Mosheng's arms, his figure slowly fading from view.
0:38:36|0:38:55|He Yichen stood in the university, heartbroken, and from then on let go of his obsession. In the snowy night, his tearful eyes had lost focus, but he forced a smile. In the hospital, He Yichen handed a collection of Xu Zhimo's poems to Zhao Mosheng.
0:39:7|0:39:16|[He Yichen] reached out and embraced her, [He Yichen] said softly.
0:39:17|0:39:24|[Zhao Mosheng] sat in front of the hospital bed, flipping through the poetry collection of Xu Zhimo. In her mind, a young girl's clear voice could be heard,
0:39:32|0:39:51|[Zhao Mosheng] looked at the sleeping [He Yichen], lying on the sickbed with a pale and thin face. With tears in her eyes, [Zhao Mosheng] looked away, flipping through the pages of the book, only to realize that all the sticky notes in the book were written by herself.
0:40:12|0:40:36|[Zhao Mosheng] stuck the post-it notes back on the leaves, held the poetry collection to her chest, while [He Yichen] was still sound asleep. Tears welled up in [Zhao Mosheng]'s eyes, as the sleeping [He Yichen] furrowed his brows. Looking at him, [Zhao Mosheng] was filled with guilt and tenderness. Her heart seemed to be pulled by an invisible thread, drawing her closer to [He Yichen] step by step. Unconsciously, she leaned in and gently kissed [He Yichen]'s lips.
0:40:36|0:40:54|[Zhao Mosheng] lingered on these slightly pale lips for a long time, as if time stood still. The wind blew the pages of the poetry collection, and the sticky notes in the book kept floating out of the window, colorful sticky notes dancing in the sunlight as if breaking free from long-time confinement.
0:40:54|0:41:12|At this moment, he regained his freedom. The screen goes black, with the verse appearing: "Quietly is the flute of parting, silence is the bridge tonight," [He Yichen] walks home with a briefcase, only to see [Zhao Mosheng] squatting by the wall drawing with a twig.
0:41:14|0:41:29|[He Yichen] suddenly froze in his tracks, and [Zhao Mosheng] looked up at him. [Zhao Mosheng] stood up, her eyes pitiful like a small animal. [He Yichen] hesitated for three seconds, as if trying to ignore her and walk past, but [Zhao Mosheng] reached out and grabbed him.
0:41:30|0:41:59|Her voice sounded like a sobbing in distress, [He Yichen] coldly turned his face away. [Zhao Mosheng]'s hand trembled slightly and then slowly retracted. She kept looking into [He Yichen]'s eyes but dared not make any move. The street was deserted, with only the dim yellow light from the street lamps. [He Yichen] walked back to the living room, with [Zhao Mosheng] following closely behind in small steps. He threw his briefcase on the sofa at the entrance and quickly walked to the open kitchen.
0:42:1|0:42:14|[He Yichen] opened the refrigerator, [Zhao Mosheng] shrank in the living room and glanced at him, then walked into the kitchen with her head down. [He Yichen] took out a bottle of beer, bit open the cap with his teeth, and leaned against a pillar to drink the beer.
0:42:32|0:42:53|He Yichen still had his back to her, asking with certainty, while tears welled up in Zhao Mosheng's eyes but she couldn't speak. Her eyes darted around, and He Yichen turned his head to stare at her urgently. Zhao Mosheng shook her head in panic but dared not look directly at him. He Yichen walked towards the dining table.
0:43:8|0:43:35|His words were sarcastic. Zhao Mosheng quickly wiped away the tears on her cheeks. He Yichen stared at Zhao Mosheng as he raised the bottle to drink. Zhao Mosheng spoke intermittently, but He Yichen's expression remained unchanged. His Adam's apple moved slightly as Zhao Mosheng unconsciously repeated herself. Suddenly, He Yichen's mouth curled up at the corner, he took a deep breath and said.
0:43:47|0:44:4|He Yichen couldn't bear it anymore and interrupted Zhao Mosheng. He tried to control his anger, turning away before tears could fall. Zhao Mosheng stood in front of the table, watching He Yichen's back, her voice as soft as a mosquito.
0:44:5|0:44:16|She quietly walked to the entrance. He Yichen frowned and looked at the ground, tears silently sliding down his face. He Yichen then raised the bottle and took another sip of wine, his lips trembling slightly, tears bursting out completely.
0:44:16|0:44:37|With his eyes closed as if pondering a difficult problem, He Yichen swam frantically in the pool with freestyle, his long-term training in the pool making his body particularly strong and muscular, his muscles tensed into a streamlined shape. Like a white strip in the waves, he cut through the waves tirelessly, swimming back and forth countless times in the water.
0:44:37|0:44:48|He Yichen swam to the edge of the pool and broke the water, his hands supporting the marble tiles, breathing heavily. The sign of the whiskey bar reflected a dazzling light, and He Yichen sat at the bar chatting with William.
0:45:4|0:45:19|William held the bar with both hands, quietly watching He Yichen. He Yichen furrowed his brows, tears glistening under his eyelids. He picked up the wine glass and drank it all in one gulp, then took a deep breath and wiped away the tears on his cheeks.
0:45:21|0:45:27|He pushed the wine glass in front of William, who helplessly placed a glass of orange juice in front of He Yichen.
0:45:41|0:45:56|He Yichen pointed at William and shouted angrily. William picked up a strange-shaped bottle from the side and placed it in front of him. Before William could stabilize it, He Yichen took the bottle and looked it over.
0:46:17|0:46:26|He Yichen couldn't help but chuckle as he watched William earnestly talking about life lessons. In front of the Peace Building where Zhao Mosheng lived, He Yichen was sitting in the car making a phone call.
0:46:27|0:46:37|The phone went unanswered, [He Yichen] furrowed his brows, impatiently put down the phone, and looked through the skylight at the building.
0:46:41|0:46:53|The door suddenly opened, with [He Yichen]'s hand frozen in mid-air. At this moment, [Zhao Mosheng] had messy hair, a flustered expression, and was standing barefoot on the wooden floor. [He Yichen]'s gaze quickly caught sight of the pipes inside the room.
0:46:54|0:47:2|Water was gushing out of the kitchen pipes, [Zhao Mosheng] hurriedly tidied her hair, while [He Yichen] pulled his head back from peeking into the room.
0:47:10|0:47:21|[He Yichen] responded calmly, the car suddenly stopped, [He Yichen] looked straight ahead and said.
0:47:22|0:47:28|[Zhao Mosheng] closed her eyes and took a deep breath, knowing that [He Yichen] was about to end it, with no room for regret.
0:47:29|0:47:36|[Zhao Mosheng] made up her mind, and [He Yichen] turned his head to look at her, asking provocatively,
0:47:49|0:47:55|[Zhao Mosheng] nodded firmly, while [He Yichen] darkened his eyes and stepped on the accelerator.
0:47:58|0:48:8|The car drove into the main lane, seemingly heading towards the road to the future. Inside the marriage registration center in Yangpu District, Shanghai, the staff stared at [He Yichen] and [Zhao Mosheng].
0:48:18|0:48:25|The staff rolled their eyes, speechlessly brought out an electronic calendar, and pointed with their index finger to the date on it.
0:48:59|0:49:6|The stamp was pressed onto the marriage certificate of the two.
0:49:24|0:49:37|The slender [Zhao Mosheng] stood frozen in place holding something in her hands, while in [He Yichen]'s home, William was directing workers to move furniture.
0:49:39|0:49:55|[Zhao Mosheng] dragged her suitcase into the house, curiously looking at the decoration. William pointed to the entrance for the workers, and a woman with high-heeled black stockings walked into the house. Miss Wen asked while holding a lunch box.
0:49:57|0:50:7|She saw [Zhao Mosheng] standing there, [Zhao Mosheng] smiled awkwardly, Miss Wen noticed her suitcase.
0:50:32|0:50:49|Miss Wen spoke straightforwardly and efficiently, [Zhao Mosheng] looked embarrassed with her eyes darting around. Miss Wen pointed at the wontons, and she took a few steps before turning back.
0:50:59|0:51:30|She walked away after speaking, [Zhao Mosheng] looked sharply at William. William, oblivious, waved away the dust in front of him. [Zhao Mosheng] looked at the wonton in her hand thoughtfully. William held a medicine box with one hand on the table and instructed [Zhao Mosheng]. [Zhao Mosheng] stopped adjusting the lamp and walked over to William from the chair.
0:51:36|0:51:45|[Zhao Mosheng] took off her glove with one hand and looked at William. When William was about to leave, she called out to him. William stopped but didn't turn around. [Zhao Mosheng] asked.
0:51:48|0:51:54|William turned around with red eyes, recalling.
0:52:9|0:52:14|William finished speaking and looked at [Zhao Mosheng] with a smile in his eyes. [Zhao Mosheng] smiled apologetically.
0:52:14|0:52:32|[Zhao Mosheng] walked into the bathroom with a box of clothes. The built-in wardrobe that occupied an entire wall slowly opened, and [Zhao Mosheng] stepped inside. The wardrobe was filled with white shirts and gray suits. She tentatively reached out to pull up the sleeve of a shirt, her eyes full of anticipation and hope for the new life.
0:52:32|0:52:45|[Zhao Mosheng] picked up the razor next to the sink and playfully gestured on her face in front of the mirror. After playing with the razor, she extended her right hand and formed it into a gun shape, trying to look cool in front of the mirror, then chuckled shyly.
0:52:45|0:52:54|[Zhao Mosheng] looked around in the bathroom, walked barefoot to the dressing mirror, and had already put on [He Yichen]'s white shirt, imitating [He Yichen]'s tone.
0:53:17|0:53:35|[Zhao Mosheng] softened her expression and imitated what [He Yichen] said on the day they registered their marriage. As the personal imitation show ended, she shyly covered her face. The dazzling and beautiful night view of Guangzhou was mesmerizing. [He Yichen] answered the phone in the private room.
0:54:3|0:54:9|[Zhao Mosheng] finished speaking hesitantly, and [He Yichen] hung up the phone, with a barely noticeable smile on his lips.
0:54:33|0:54:50|The Customs Clock is illuminated by warm yellow lights, and the Oriental Pearl Tower shines brightly with purple lights. [Zhao Mosheng] is sleeping in the bedroom when it seems like something is approaching her eyes, waking her up.
0:54:50|0:55:14|Lying on her side, [Zhao Mosheng] propped herself up from the bed, groggily pressed the switch on the headboard, and the spacious bedroom was illuminated by four wall lamps. There was nothing unusual in the room. [Zhao Mosheng] opened the industrial-style door and found no one in the living room downstairs. Quietly holding a golf club, she walked towards the stairs, glancing around vigilantly as she descended, blocking the club in front of her.
0:55:16|0:55:30|The TV in the living room was on mute, and someone walked up behind [Zhao Mosheng]. [Zhao Mosheng] closed her eyes and waved the cue stick randomly, but when she looked up, she was shocked to see [He Yichen] in front of her.
0:55:59|0:56:8|[Zhao Mosheng] was thrown onto the bed by [He Yichen], and she immediately sat up, clutching her chest. [He Yichen] stared straight at [Zhao Mosheng], his Adam's apple bobbing.
0:56:10|0:56:23|He Yichen turned stiffly and left, leaving Zhao Mosheng on the bed looking bewildered. Zhao Mosheng watched him leave the bedroom, blinking as she sank into thought. At the dining table, He Yichen picked up a few strands of noodles with his chopsticks and then put them down.
0:56:23|0:56:44|He Yichen sighed as he looked at the bowl, then raised his eyes to the upstairs. His eyes were rolling around, and his body seemed to have turned into stone as he maintained a motionless posture of looking up at the sky. Zhao Mosheng picked up the skincare water placed on the small table beside her.
0:57:9|0:57:17|The two friends walked up to [Zhao Mosheng] wrapped in towels.
0:57:32|0:57:44|[Zhao Mosheng] sat on the bed and opened the online shopping delivery. She took out a tie from the box and pulled it tightly. The door at home was opened, and [Zhao Mosheng] heard a voice and quickly ran down the stairs.
0:57:44|0:58:10|Through the lattice window of the entrance, she could be seen wearing a navy-style uniform. [Zhao Mosheng] ran to the screen behind the entrance, stretched out a leg, showing her slender calf. Then she turned around, leaning on the screen with one elbow, hand on her waist, showcasing her soft waist. Facing the entrance again, she made a scissor hand gesture in front of her eyes. When [Zhao Mosheng] saw a group of people in front of her, she was instantly stunned.
0:58:11|0:58:26|He Yichen decisively covered Lao Yuan and Xiang Heng's eyes with his hands. [Zhao Mosheng] ran back to the bedroom like the wind, while He Yichen walked into the bedroom and lifted the covers on the bed.
0:58:43|0:58:49|Everyone sat around the dining table, with the hotpot bubbling and steaming.
1:0:27|1:0:35|[He Yichen] smiled as he looked at Xiang Heng speaking. Everyone remained silent, waiting to see what would happen next. Lao Yuan awkwardly looked away and dropped his chopsticks.
1:1:44|1:2:17|William turned his head to look at [He Yichen], then slowly shifted his gaze to the table. Mr. Yuan raised his hand to speak, the game continued lively. In the western restaurant, [He Yichen] and [Zhao Mosheng] sat facing each other. A musician passed by them playing the violin, a waiter brought a covered dish. [He Yichen] opened the lid to reveal a ring box, a large diamond ring sparkling inside. [Zhao Mosheng] saw the ring, covered her mouth in surprise, looking at [He Yichen] in disbelief.
1:2:17|1:2:38|[He Yichen] smiled as he looked out the window, with [Zhao Mosheng] following his gaze. The fireworks outside were dazzling, and on the tallest building, a sentence in English was displayed: "youaremysunshine." [Zhao Mosheng] was moved to tears by all this. [He Yichen]'s reverie was interrupted.
1:2:43|1:2:56|[Zhao Mosheng] walked into the restaurant with a bag on her back. [He Yichen] sat at the table and saw her. [Zhao Mosheng] smiled at [He Yichen] and walked quickly towards him. [He Yichen] stood up to greet her, when a voice came from the neighboring table.
1:3:3|1:3:8|Pei Fangmei excitedly hugged [Zhao Mosheng], while [He Yichen] anxiously glanced outside the window and couldn't help but walk forward.
1:3:33|1:3:41|[He Yichen] turned and left, Pei Fangmei didn't know what was going on, her eyes followed [He Yichen] out of the restaurant, she asked.
1:3:42|1:3:56|[Zhao Mosheng] was stunned, completely caught off guard. [He Yichen] pushed open the door of the restaurant and walked down the steps, quickly striding to the side of the road before suddenly stopping. His eyes were red, breathing heavily, recalling the tragic scene that had stayed with him until now.
1:3:57|1:4:2|As a child, [He Yichen] cried like a tearful person watching his father's accident scene.
1:4:11|1:4:39|[He Yichen] came to his senses from his memories, he had booked the LED screen on the Bund building. He looked at his watch, the hands already pointing to nine o'clock. Lowering his wrist, the Shanghai Center Tower opposite lit up with a red heart soaring into the sky. [Zhao Mosheng] walked step by step towards the window, everyone in the restaurant looked outside and discussed. The red heart on the electronic screen of the building spread out, the light changing from red to blue. [He Yichen] and [Zhao Mosheng] both gazed at the building with tears in their eyes, the difference being
1:4:39|1:5:4|Zhao Mosheng was crying tears of joy, while [He Yichen] was filled with numerous negative emotions. The LED screen on the building showered colorful candies, with an English sentence appearing: youaremysunshine. The Zhendan Building next to it also lit up a red heart, displaying the words I love S. Zhao Mosheng ran out of the restaurant and rushed to hug [He Yichen] when she saw him on the roadside.
1:5:30|1:5:37|Zhao Mosheng lowered her eyes and shook her head in contemplation.
1:6:3|1:6:33|[He Yichen]'s phone rang, he answered and walked away, leaving [Zhao Mosheng] standing there at a loss. Tears of grievance welled up in her eyes. [He Yichen] slumped on the sofa at home, staring blankly at the ceiling. He sat up, covering his nose with his hands, lost in thought. The harsh reality seemed unwilling to leave them, when would they be able to regain their past happiness.
1:6:33|1:7:5|A muffled thunder sounded, [He Yichen] picked up his coat and went out. The car was parked downstairs at [Zhao Mosheng]'s house. [He Yichen] closed the car door and hurried into the lobby of the residential building. He forgot to turn off the windshield wipers. [He Yichen] fiercely knocked on [Zhao Mosheng]'s door. The door opened, and Zhao Mosheng was drying her hair with a towel. Seeing [He Yichen] silent, Zhao Mosheng said irritably.
1:7:6|1:7:19|[He Yichen] glared at her with a grim expression, strode into the room, and caught [Zhao Mosheng] off guard, causing her to stagger. He walked to the coffee table and saw a Hong Kong and Macau travel permit with several sheets of paper sandwiched in between.
1:7:21|1:7:29|He Yichen quickly picked up the documents and opened them, his eyes filled with deep sadness. Zhao Mosheng coughed and covered her mouth with a towel.
1:7:33|1:8:2|He Yichen threw his ID back on the table, his gloomy eyes fixed on Zhao Mosheng without any relaxation. Anger gradually gathered as Zhao Mosheng hesitantly uttered half a word. He Yichen grabbed her head and forcefully kissed her. Zhao Mosheng was pushed against the cabinet as He Yichen leaned down and kissed her fiercely again. He Yichen lifted Zhao Mosheng horizontally, quickly walked to the bed and threw her onto it. He Yichen took off his coat and pressed down on Zhao Mosheng without hesitation.
1:8:4|1:8:29|Zhao Mosheng struggled and knocked over the water glass on the bedside table. He Yichen's lost rationality was slowly regained. He was still half-pressed on Zhao Mosheng, but his gaze was drawn to the cold medicine on the bedside table. He sat blankly on the edge of the bed. Zhao Mosheng's clothes were disheveled as she shrank at the head of the bed. He Yichen reached out to help Zhao Mosheng tidy up her scattered hair. Zhao Mosheng reflexively avoided it, lifted her hair back, and lowered her head to calm her breathing.
1:8:29|1:8:37|[He Yichen] raised his hand slightly and touched Zhao Mosheng's sleeve. Startled, Zhao Mosheng moved to the edge of the pillow like a frightened rabbit. [He Yichen] whispered,
1:8:40|1:8:52|Zhao Mosheng crossed her hands tightly holding the knitted coat, while He Yichen picked up the windbreaker by the bedside, stood up and left. He put on the windbreaker at the bedroom door and disappeared into the corridor. The room was left with only Zhao Mosheng.
1:8:53|1:9:17|He Yichen walked unsteadily to the car, the wipers still swiping away the layers of rain on the window. The car lights were flashing, but he stood by the car door motionless, letting the rain wash over him. He Yichen couldn't open his eyes against the rain, but at that moment, Zhao Mosheng rushed out. He Yichen turned his head to look at the entrance of the building, while Zhao Mosheng stopped by the mailbox, quietly watching He Yichen in the rain.
1:9:17|1:9:40|[Zhao Mosheng] rushed into the rain, He Yichen saw her coming and quickly opened the car door. [Zhao Mosheng] hugged He Yichen from behind, He Yichen gently held the slender hands around his waist. He Yichen turned around, [Zhao Mosheng]'s eyes filled with tears. He Yichen quickly took off his coat, covered [Zhao Mosheng] with it, and used his hands as a canopy to shield her from the rain.
1:9:40|1:9:48|[Zhao Mosheng] looked up at He Yichen with tears in her eyes, He Yichen looked back at her with pity. [Zhao Mosheng] explained with trembling lips,
1:9:55|1:10:24|Tears welled up in her eyes and [Zhao Mosheng] could no longer hold back. She suddenly embraced Yichen and kissed his rain-soaked lips. They stood stubbornly embracing in the rain, their bodies tightly pressed together. The kiss was gentle and lingering, devoid of the complex emotions from a few minutes ago, only full of trust and love. At this moment, joy and sorrow were no longer distinct. Their kiss seemed like an acceptance. The warm yellow taillights flickered and gradually turned into the bathroom.
1:10:24|1:10:53|The dim light, the sprinkler spraying fine water, He Yichen lifted Zhao Mosheng's wet hair in front of her forehead, bowed his head affectionately and kissed it, He Yichen's hot body pressed against Zhao Mosheng, the fiery kisses kept falling on her lips, warm water poured down He Yichen's broad back, flowing down his chin, Zhao Mosheng's soft white shoulders exposed in the warm mist, delicate skin covered with glistening water droplets.
1:10:53|1:11:8|She was tightly held in He Yichen's arms, the warm breath blowing on her neck, [Zhao Mosheng] immersed in this tender kiss, until all was silent. The sunlight shone through the window panes, and on the chair beside the bed lay Yichen's white shirt.
1:11:8|1:11:40|Last night He Yichen and [Zhao Mosheng] slept in each other's arms. Now He Yichen has woken up, he is holding [Zhao Mosheng]'s shoulder, gently rubbing her arm with his thumb. He lowers his head slightly to look at [Zhao Mosheng]'s sleeping face, plants a kiss on her forehead. [Zhao Mosheng] murmurs, buries her head in He Yichen's neck. There is an extra ring on the ring finger of [Zhao Mosheng]'s left hand. She feels the sunlight shining on her eyelids, opens her eyes drowsily, then closes them again, holding He Yichen's arm tightly.
1:11:40|1:12:2|[Zhao Mosheng] sleepily caressed He Yichen's face, and suddenly she noticed the ring on her hand. Her gaze fixed on the ring as she extended her arm to let the sunlight shine through the cracks between her fingers. The design of the ring was extremely simple, with the diamond on the ring reflecting the sunlight coming through the window, creating a small rainbow on her fingertips.
1:12:2|1:12:13|[Zhao Mosheng] looked at [He Yichen], who was smiling and gazing at her. Tears of happiness welled up in [Zhao Mosheng]'s eyes as she embraced [He Yichen], who planted a kiss on her forehead.
1:12:24|1:12:33|[Zhao Mosheng] counted the bricks on the ground, [He Yichen] appeared with an umbrella. [Zhao Mosheng] playfully scolded him and then linked her arm with his.
1:12:43|1:13:0|[He Yichen] switched to holding the umbrella, putting his arm around [Zhao Mosheng], smiling brightly. As they passed by a tree, [Zhao Mosheng] was already leaning on [He Yichen]'s back, holding the umbrella. [He Yichen] lifted [Zhao Mosheng] up a bit, and the two of them laughed sweetly.
1:13:2|1:13:26|On the school anniversary day, [Zhao Mosheng] and [He Yichen] walked side by side on the university campus. The main road was crowded with people, and a young campus couple bumped into [He Yichen]. [Zhao Mosheng] smiled at them, and the young couple hurriedly held hands and ran towards the auditorium. [He Yichen] picked up his phone.
1:13:36|1:13:48|[Zhao Mosheng] smiled without saying a word, then she hit him. [He Yichen] felt like he was taking care of a child, and he watched [Zhao Mosheng] run away with a smile.
1:14:46|1:14:50|Outside the auditorium, [Zhao Mosheng] stood at the edge of the crowd, watching Ying Hui on the big screen.
1:15:11|1:15:27|In the applause and pointing at the ring on her left ring finger, [Zhao Mosheng] heard these words with a somewhat dazed expression. [Zhao Mosheng] picked up the phone and said,
1:15:28|1:15:36|[He Yichen] listened to the phone with a furrowed brow, while [Zhao Mosheng] had already walked up behind him.
1:15:38|1:15:53|[He Yichen] noticed the sound of breathing not far away, turned his head to look behind him, [Zhao Mosheng] put down her phone and looked at [He Yichen], as if they were reuniting after a long separation. A warm breeze seemed to blow through [Zhao Mosheng]'s heart, and the whole world became peaceful and kind because of [He Yichen].
1:16:26|1:16:33|[Zhao Mosheng] had to return to her old profession.
1:17:49|1:18:13|He Yichen smiled at [Zhao Mosheng], gently putting his arm around her waist as they walked into the private room. A waitress entered the room carrying a fruit platter, where two men in suits were singing enthusiastically. Xiang Heng clapped his hands with great enthusiasm, while a classmate held a bottle of wine to share gossip.
1:19:14|1:19:22|[Zhao Mosheng] and Xiang Heng clinked glasses and drank up in one gulp. Ying Hui walked into the bathroom and suddenly spoke.
1:19:43|1:20:5|He Yichen's hand wiping motion gradually slowed down. He turned his head to look at Ying Hui, who neatly folded the tissue in his hand. It was already late when they got home. He Yichen carried the tipsy Zhao Mosheng into the living room. Zhao Mosheng was so drunk that she was leaning on He Yichen with her hands loosely hanging on him. She tilted her head midway but still didn't wake up.
1:20:5|1:20:21|He Yichen gently carried her up the stairs. In the bedroom, He Yichen stood by the bed, gazing at the sleeping [Zhao Mosheng]. His brows furrowed, suppressing the emotions churning in his heart. The night lights on the Bund were dazzlingly beautiful.
1:20:21|1:20:41|He Yichen arrived at a restaurant surrounded by greenery, where Zhao Mosheng leaned against the railing watching him. They sat down, and Zhao Mosheng poured the wine, then put down the bottle. She picked up the glass, took a sip under He Yichen's gaze, and then put it back.
1:20:48|1:21:11|Ying Hui placed the phone in front of He Yichen. He Yichen reached out and picked up the phone, using two fingers to zoom in on the displayed image. It was a prenuptial agreement in full English. He Yichen scrolled to the bottom where the signatures of Ying Hui and [Zhao Mosheng] were. He looked at Ying Hui with a questioning gaze, but Ying Hui did not immediately respond. Instead, she picked up the glass on the table and took a sip.
1:21:51|1:21:55|The photo was instantly printed from the camera, and [Zhao Mosheng] handed the photo to Ying Hui.
1:22:3|1:22:26|[Zhao Mosheng] hesitantly took the money, [Zhao Mosheng] saw a female police officer leading a little boy over, [Zhao Mosheng] pulled the child to stand next to Ying Hui, politely smiled at the female officer, and the man in the suit said,
1:23:6|1:23:15|The police officer asked, and Ying Hui glanced at [Zhao Mosheng].
1:23:24|1:23:29|Will you marry me? At the ceremony, the priest asked,
1:23:35|1:23:49|[Zhao Mosheng] said "I do," and then the priest asked Yinghui. As soon as the words were spoken, Jiayi ran towards [Zhao Mosheng] and threw herself into her arms. [Zhao Mosheng] caressed Jiayi's hair, the wind gently blowing her hair, everything was so beautiful.
1:24:22|1:24:33|A man suddenly pulled out a handgun from behind, the front desk attendant immediately called the police, the attendant bent down and slipped away, the man fired a shot in the direction where He Yichen was standing, and then fled when he saw the situation was not good.
1:24:35|1:24:45|In the hospital, [Zhao Mosheng] quietly stayed by Ying Hui's side. When Ying Hui woke up from the bed, [Zhao Mosheng] was already asleep on the sofa.
1:25:3|1:25:10|[Zhao Mosheng] sat beside the computer, with the search interface displaying on the screen. The keyword in the search bar was He Yichen.
1:25:47|1:25:52|Zhao Mosheng's face turned red as she lifted her head and met He Yichen's gaze.
1:25:58|1:26:15|[Zhao Mosheng] blinked without reacting, He Yichen slowly leaned closer to her face, his hand lightly touching the strands of hair on her cheek, about to touch her lips. Suddenly, [Zhao Mosheng] snapped out of it, pushed He Yichen away abruptly, and ran out.
1:26:38|1:26:48|He continued to speak without admitting defeat, with the lawyer sitting in front of [Zhao Mosheng], presenting her with a divorce agreement and another special agreement.
1:27:2|1:27:16|[Zhao Mosheng] looked up at the lawyer, picked up the pen and paused for a few seconds on the special agreement, then signed on the divorce agreement. He Yichen looked at the table and asked,
1:27:25|1:27:45|He Yichen's politeness showed no emotion, Ying Hui squinted his eyes with a drunken look. Ying Hui looked at the half-empty glass with his mouth slightly open, He Yichen took the glass and finished the remaining wine, then got up to leave. Ying Hui called out to him.
1:28:9|1:28:19|Ying Hui's mouth stopped at the last word, seemingly casually looking at [He Yichen]. [He Yichen] remained silent, glaring at Ying Hui in anger. After a while, he walked back to the dining table.
1:28:19|1:28:36|Ying Hui looked with interest at [He Yichen] standing in front of the chair. As soon as his eyelids dropped, [He Yichen] sat back in his original position. Ying Hui's raised chin returned with satisfaction as he picked up his glass and took a sip, continuing to speak.
1:29:21|1:29:29|Ying Hui froze with his index finger up, [He Yichen] quickly walked out of the restaurant. Ying Hui suddenly shouted angrily,
1:29:41|1:29:52|Ying Hui was trembling with anger, but the tears in his eyes couldn't be hidden. [He Yichen] stopped by the roadside, Ying Hui drank a glass of wine, closed his eyes and recalled the time spent with [Zhao Mosheng].
1:29:54|1:30:20|When he was in the hospital, [Zhao Mosheng] secretly brought a paper bag. Yinghui quickly closed the door of the ward. There were fried peanuts and a few almost empty bottles of Xiaoer white wine on the table. Yinghui and [Zhao Mosheng] sat cross-legged on the sofa playing finger-guessing game, happy like two children. In the restaurant, Yinghui leaned weakly against the back of the chair with his eyes closed, tears seeming to be on the verge of falling from under his eyelids. He whistled with his index finger.
1:30:32|1:30:36|The whistle plays the melody of "you are my sunshine".
1:30:37|1:30:42|Ying Hui was still drinking alone in the restaurant, and [He Yichen] took a few steps forward after listening for a while.
1:30:43|1:31:6|The American pastoral style of the restaurant extends to the small path, with the cold air hitting [He Yichen] in the face as he turns out of the path. With a cold gaze, he slowly opens his eyes and sighs, his fingertips following the melody in his mind. The ups and downs of the long years are told in just a few hours.
1:31:7|1:31:36|[He Yichen] returned home in the early hours of the morning. He sat on the edge of the bed, looking at [Zhao Mosheng] who was sleeping soundly on her side. Unable to contain his emotions any longer, [He Yichen] started to sob quietly, his chin trembling with each sob, tears rolling down his cheeks. The days when [Zhao Mosheng] was alone in the United States had torn his heart apart. The suppressed sobs finally woke up the sleeping [Zhao Mosheng].
1:31:36|1:31:43|He quickly wiped away the tears on his face, [Zhao Mosheng] sat up and touched his face.
1:31:45|1:31:56|[He Yichen], with red eyes, looked at [Zhao Mosheng], suddenly pulled [Zhao Mosheng] into his arms. He held [Zhao Mosheng] so tightly, as if trying to merge her into his own body.
1:32:13|1:32:51|[Zhao Mosheng] shook her head repeatedly, burying her face in [He Yichen]'s neck. Memories surged in, the year when [Zhao Mosheng] dragged her luggage to check in at the airport terminal. She turned her head to urge her father to go back, and her father smiled and waved at her. [Zhao Mosheng] waved her documents to bid farewell to her father, pushed the luggage into the passage, and after she left, her father suddenly turned his face, tears welling up in his eyes. Sending [Zhao Mosheng] abroad was the only thing he could do.
1:33:40|1:33:55|She stood alone on the streets of America, surrounded by a bustling crowd, which made her appear calm. [Zhao Mosheng] covered her heart with her phone case, tears streaming down her face. Now, [Zhao Mosheng] lay on [He Yichen]'s chest, pouring out her heart.
1:34:19|1:34:24|[He Yichen] rested his chin on the top of [Zhao Mosheng]'s head, embracing her with his arms.
1:34:33|1:34:54|Smiling deeply and lightly at [Zhao Mosheng], he raised his hand to stroke her hair, and the two held each other tighter. In the office, [He Yichen] took off his leather shoes and put on sneakers, stretching his legs to assess the effect.
1:35:2|1:35:14|[Pei Fangmei] walked in elegantly, wearing a black and white striped dress and sunglasses. She looked around the law firm environment as she walked, and when she saw [He Yichen], she took off her glasses and smiled. [He Yichen] slowly sat up straight.
1:35:16|1:35:19|[Pei Fangmei] took a sip of coffee and said.
1:35:24|1:35:31|This cold address made [Pei Fangmei] shudder, and she replied with a gentle expression.
1:36:0|1:36:12|He Yichen answered lightly, staring at [Pei Fangmei] as she took a sip of coffee. [Pei Fangmei] looked around, sipping tea calmly and peacefully.
1:36:22|1:36:32|He Yichen looked at her and said calmly.
1:36:41|1:36:51|[Pei Fangmei] murmured softly, and she sternly questioned,
1:37:44|1:37:48|He Yichen's roar caught Zhao Mosheng off guard.
1:38:4|1:38:25|[Pei Fangmei] pinched her brow, took a deep breath, and He Yichen turned around, smiling self-deprecatingly.
1:38:59|1:39:16|He Yichen remained motionless, with no response for a long time. Zhao Mosheng got up and left, only to hear the young man who had been aggressive all along make a calm statement.
1:39:37|1:39:51|[Pei Fangmei] was first stunned, then nodded slightly with tears in her eyes. She walked quickly towards the door and happened to bump into [Zhao Mosheng]. [Pei Fangmei] walked straight out, leaving [Zhao Mosheng] looking puzzled at He Yichen.
