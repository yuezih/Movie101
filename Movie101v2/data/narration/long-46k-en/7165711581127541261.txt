0:1:7|0:1:16|In the dark night, the empty courtyard was surrounded by smoke, and the unburned incense in the courtyard made a rustling sound, which seemed particularly abrupt in the quiet night.
0:1:17|0:1:29|Thick smoke drifted to the front of the dilapidated door, where two men with numerous wounds lay. One was lying at the doorway, while the other was leaning against the wall not far away. Both were motionless, having already ceased breathing.
0:1:30|0:1:46|At the east gate of the city, several armed Japanese soldiers turned the corner. Behind them were a few members of the puppet army band, kicking their legs and blowing horns and drums. Then, the members stopped in front to play military music to welcome the Japanese soldiers into the city.
0:1:47|0:2:3|In front of the notice board, a small translator with a big head and a polite demeanor, carrying a gun bag diagonally, [Zhao Yangren], walked over. After stopping, he pretended to tidy up his standard traitor outfit, listening to the music while looking around at the people.
0:2:3|0:2:14|After the performance, [Zhao Yangren] approached the Japanese captain with a flattering smile, received a nod of approval, then turned towards the civilians, cleared his throat, and began to speak.
0:2:46|0:3:4|Looking expectantly at the people, he saw no one congratulating him. After a moment, the fake smile on his face disappeared. After scanning the whole room with his eyes, he turned and walked to the left side of the salted fish vendor, who was scratching his head. With a malicious smile on his face, he spoke.
0:3:7|0:3:29|Without waiting for the other party's consent, the fake soldiers behind came up and checked the number of shoes. Then they walked towards the next vendor, carefully inspecting the stall before speaking. After that, he lowered his head to look at the fish in front of the old man, but a strong stench made him furrow his brows.
0:3:41|0:3:55|At this moment, the Japanese captain stopped and aimed his gun at the old man. After the old man fell to the ground with blood gushing from his chest, [Yu Mancang] tried to rush towards the Japanese with a knife, but his companion quickly stopped him and put a sack over [Yu Mancang]'s head, dragging him away from the scene.
0:3:58|0:4:1|After speaking, He Hua immediately plunged into the nearby lake and swam further and further away.
0:4:27|0:4:35|On the other side, the young soldier handed the telegram to Commander Zhou, who had a pistol holster around his waist. After reading it, he relaxed his brows and let out a slight sigh.
0:5:10|0:5:14|The political commissar nodded in approval, and Commander Zhou turned back to continue speaking.
0:5:35|0:5:39|After listening to the political commissar, He Rong once again climbed onto Commander Zhou's face.
0:6:9|0:6:25|On the clear lake, a small boat is leisurely moving forward. The girl [He Hua], dressed in bright clothes, sits quietly at the bow, her bright eyes revealing her love for this world. A gust of wind blows, causing the lotus leaves to dance gracefully on the lake, with the girl [He Hua] navigating through them on the small boat.
0:6:25|0:6:32|As the sky darkened, [He Hua] came ashore and arrived at the uncle's house. She sat on a wooden stool, looking at the uncle opposite with a troubled expression.
0:6:40|0:6:44|The middle-aged man with a blue face shook his head as he listened to [He Hua]'s persuasion.
0:7:29|0:7:36|As soon as the silver flower fell, [Hu Shuisheng] walked in. He complained while grabbing food and throwing it at [Hu Shuisheng].
0:8:9|0:8:24|[He Hua] was about to leave to chase after the sound of water that had just left. Uncle Hu hurriedly stopped him, his thin face filled with conflict. After hesitating for a moment, he turned and walked towards the dining table, picked up the cooked corn on the table, and handed it to [He Hua].
0:8:27|0:8:47|The uncle's gaze followed [He Hua] until she disappeared in the direction of the departing water. In the sky covered with dark clouds, a glimpse of the moon gradually appeared. [He Hua] saw Hu Shuisheng standing alone quietly by the side of the boat on the shore, and she walked towards him softly. At this moment, a sense of despair surged up in Hu Shuisheng like a raging tide.
0:8:51|0:9:9|Sensing the worried look of [He Hua], she suppressed her inner distress, adjusted her state, and explained to [He Hua]. The Sha Lake guerrilla team was attacked by the Japanese devils, and [He Hua] could not hide her sorrowful expression. After a moment of silence, she spoke.
0:9:12|0:9:16|The sadness in their eyes was impossible to hide.
0:9:21|0:9:28|After Shuisheng finished speaking, he closed his eyes in despair, leaving He Hua at a loss for words on how to comfort him.
0:9:32|0:9:45|She handed the corn to [Hu Shuisheng], who shook his head and sighed, indicating no appetite. [He Hua] understood the troubles in [Hu Shuisheng]'s heart, so she leaned her head and thought for a moment before speaking to persuade him.
0:9:59|0:10:8|The moonlight was dim, reflecting on the shimmering lake. The flags by the lake were blown so hard that they couldn't stand straight, but they still stubbornly struggled.
0:10:18|0:10:22|[Hu Shuisheng] didn't know why he was being asked, so he could only nod helplessly.
0:10:54|0:11:4|Watching He Hua's eyes filled with determination, Hu Shuisheng gradually rid himself of his hesitation. After a moment of contemplation, he sighed deeply with a lowered gaze.
0:11:19|0:11:39|After receiving affirmation from [He Hua], [Hu Shuisheng]'s previously despondent expression vanished, replaced by a determined gaze towards the woman who brought him hope. The first light of dawn pierced through the thin mist, illuminating the two young individuals full of vigor as they discussed their future.
0:12:8|0:12:13|Facing Ban Tian's praise, [Zhao Yangren] showed a flattering smile, exchanged pleasantries, and then finished his drink in one gulp.
0:13:4|0:13:12|Outside the courtyard, the searchlight on the makeshift cannon tower sweeps around, while two Japanese soldiers with rifles on their backs take turns patrolling the area.
0:13:12|0:13:28|Under the reed marsh by the wall, [He Hua] moved swiftly with a harpoon in hand, advancing with a bow on his back. With agile movements, he maneuvered under the watchful eyes of the Japanese soldiers, reaching the closest point to them. He then took out a slingshot and aimed at the kerosene lamp nailed to the wood.
0:13:28|0:13:45|The collision of stones and wood disturbed the Japanese soldiers, [He Hua] angrily threw a harpoon at them and fled. The next morning, [He Hua] arrived at the assembly point with a sullen expression, still furious about the failed ambush and obstruction by water sounds from the previous day, he once again vented his anger on the reed fluff in his hand.
0:13:46|0:13:59|Catching the gaze of everyone's attention, he did not feel guilty for being late. He walked towards the bamboo pavilion, sat down in front of everyone without any courtesy, and started speaking as soon as He Hua took his seat, with Hu Shuisheng adjusting his tone.
0:14:25|0:14:40|Jian [Yu Mancang] is still angry because of his own obstruction yesterday, and [Hu Shuisheng] doesn't want to explain anymore. [He Hua] sees [Hu Shuisheng]'s dilemma, stands up and moves towards her side, and slowly speaks.
0:15:40|0:15:43|The guerrilla fighters waited with puzzled expressions for an answer.
0:16:18|0:16:36|As night fell, the anti-Japanese team rowed a boat closer to the Japanese garrison. To avoid being caught in the searchlights of the Japanese, [Hu Shuisheng] and others crowded together in the cabin without moving. As they approached the garrison, they slowly stood up, climbed up the reed bank, and observed the movements of the Japanese guards.
0:16:41|0:16:55|Several people quietly moved under the eyes of the Japanese army, and when they reached the bottom of the Japanese army's defensive wall, a tense atmosphere arose. The glaring searchlights kept sweeping back and forth, as [He Hua] and Hu Shuisheng lay flat under the wall, ready to take action at any moment.
0:16:55|0:17:4|The Japanese soldiers stationed on the wall did not notice any abnormalities around them and were still in a relaxed state of alert. Below the wall, the anti-Japanese team anxiously waited for the right moment.
0:17:5|0:17:24|At this moment, a Japanese soldier walked down the wall to relieve himself. The cover of night allowed the soldiers above to remain completely undetected, relying on their well-trained patience to stay still even as the stench wafted over them. Just as the soldier finished and prepared to leave, [He Hua] leaped up and pulled the Japanese soldier's ankle, dragging him down.
0:17:26|0:17:48|The Japanese soldiers slid into the sack in Hu Shuisheng's hands like a ball, He Hua swiftly picked up the sack with her agile and strong body and ran in the opposite direction, while Zhao Yangren quickly grabbed the enemy's dropped rifle.
0:18:9|0:18:21|[Tanaka] learned that the soldier went missing and flew into a rage. After the soldier who took the blame left, he turned around and looked at [Translator Liang], who had never dared to look him in the eye. He walked towards him thoughtfully and asked.
0:18:37|0:18:43|Seeing [He Hua] suddenly smile, all anger disappeared, [Translator Liang] quickly followed suit with a smile.
0:18:56|0:19:2|[Hu Shuisheng] and [Yu Mancang], along with [Hu Bingkun], throw the sack containing the bodies of Japanese soldiers into the lake.
0:19:31|0:19:39|Commander Zhou was furious as he knew nothing about the enemy's situation. His silent and timid appearance scared his subordinates into silence.
0:21:35|0:21:54|Speak up, as the crowd dispersed, turned around, [Yu Man Cang] led the new team members to the bottom of the city wall. The three of them knocked and felt their way behind the soldiers along the wall, gagged them with sacks, picked up guns, and cooperated tacitly. In the blink of an eye, the Japanese sentry was knocked unconscious and carried away. Together with [Hu Shuisheng] leading another team, they closely watched for isolated enemies in the reeds.
0:21:55|0:22:11|He Hua rushed forward to grab the rifle, while the team members put sacks on the Japanese soldiers, carried the sacks on their shoulders, applied oil on the soles of their feet, and [Hu Shuisheng] led the third team to sneak out from the corner, cautiously approaching the Japanese sentries. Skillfully, they put sacks on the sentries and then withdrew.
0:22:11|0:22:20|The three squads put all the captured Japanese soldiers on the small boat, each tied with a lotus flower and thrown into the center of the lake. They quickly disappeared into the water.
0:22:23|0:22:31|The ripples in the lake quickly returned to calm, and a few seconds later, the beautiful He Hua emerged from the sack and floated to the surface.
0:23:14|0:23:20|[Zhao Yangren] stood in front of the table, carefully observing the other person's expression. After a while, he suddenly stood up, slammed the table, and shouted.
0:23:23|0:23:26|The Japanese patrol team in the lake carefully set up a machine gun at the bow of the boat for inspection.
0:23:53|0:24:4|[Zhao Yangren] led the puppet army squad to set up an ambush on the shore, while the anti-Japanese squad remained in combat readiness as they sailed in a small boat on the lake. On the other side, Commander Zhou walked quickly towards the political commissar studying the map.
0:25:26|0:25:30|He Hua is being harassed by a member of the pseudo army, and Zhao Yangren speaks out to reprimand them.
0:26:33|0:26:37|Translator Liang walked towards Zhao Yangren at a steady pace, and when he got closer, he opened his mouth to ask.
0:27:12|0:27:35|After Translator Liang left, Zhao Yangren put away the smile of Fengcheng Temple, frowned, and thoughtfully walked towards the gate of the command post, his mind full of thoughts about the fish-selling girl. Suddenly, he turned around, his fierce eyes looking in the direction He Hua had left, and then gave instructions to his subordinates.
0:27:35|0:27:38|The assistant immediately set out to find He Hua upon hearing the order.
0:27:39|0:27:59|Seeing them being followed, he pondered for a moment, put away his malicious expression, turned around and walked into the command post. On the way home, He Hua and Hu Shuisheng noticed they were being followed, immediately lowered their heads and quickened their pace. However, the followers of Jing Ding were intercepted by Yu Mancang, who took a shortcut.
0:27:59|0:28:7|Zhao Yangren quickly walked to the front of the Ban Tian house, stopped in front of the door, kept stretching his neck to look at Li, hesitated for a long time, and called out softly.
0:28:12|0:28:25|Board Tian turned around when he heard his voice, casting a contemptuous glance at him, and stepped out of the threshold to stop in front of the house. [Zhao Yangren] quickly greeted him with a smile and stood behind him, waiting for inquiries.
0:31:14|0:31:21|After [Zhao Yangren] left, he spent half a day pondering over the various events that had occurred, puzzled by the appearance of [He Hua].
0:31:29|0:31:54|Translator Liang walked down from the temple's arched bridge, catching a glimpse of Zhao Yangren's men who were sent to track him, but he ignored them and quickly walked away. On the other side, He Hua suddenly stopped and bowed her head. After speaking, the two turned around, dropped their bags, and walked towards their entourage.
0:31:54|0:32:11|Upon seeing the situation, the follower wanted to turn and run, but unexpectedly bumped into a full load of carrying poles when turning around. Seeing this scene, [Hu Shuisheng] and the other person turned and left. After shaking off the tail, the two walked listlessly in the reeds, feeling somewhat lost in their hearts.
0:32:44|0:32:54|[He Hua], dressed up as a peasant woman in a rice field, carrying a bamboo basket, looked around to make sure there was no one following her, and then headed towards the main hall of the temple.
0:32:55|0:33:15|In the middle of the hall, a man is kneeling and praying, while a nun stands beside him reciting scriptures softly. [He Hua] walks quietly towards the man, places the bamboo basket aside, then kneels beside him, clasping her hands together in prayer. After a moment, she opens her eyes and looks at the man beside her, speaking slowly.
0:34:5|0:34:15|After the conversation, Translator Liang closed his eyes tightly and continued to pray, while He Hua devoutly kowtowed to the idol. Then, she stood up and walked towards the nun on the side.
0:34:19|0:34:33|The two walked slowly along the pillars beside the Buddha statue towards the inner room of the main hall. At the end of the room, there was a back door leading out of the main hall. [He Hua] followed the nun's pace and stepped out of the back door, quickly returning to the gathering place of the team.
0:34:42|0:34:47|Seeing no one responding, she looked around for a few figures.
0:35:40|0:35:57|[He Hua] answered vaguely, leaving the old man puzzled. Seeing his anxious expression, the old man felt a slight unease in his heart. After [He Hua] left, the old man hesitated for a moment, then quietly followed with his cigarette in hand. The night erased the last trace of the setting sun, and the evening breeze whistled through the reeds.
0:35:57|0:36:9|[He Hua] hurriedly went to the Sand Lake Town where [Hu Shuisheng] and others were ambushed, completely unaware of the uncle closely following behind. On the other side, [Hu Shuisheng] led Xiulian and others to ambush near the Japanese military outpost.
0:36:14|0:36:22|[Hu Shuisheng] carefully observed the movements of the Hong Kong young hero soldiers, while Xiulian, seeing that he remained unmoved, urged impatiently once again.
0:36:31|0:36:48|[Hu Shuisheng] rolled up his sleeves and prepared for battle. The sleeve of his right hand accidentally touched [He Hua]'s forearm. Feeling something soft, he looked down and saw a mosquito sucking blood on [He Hua]'s forearm. He was scared and wanted to scream, but [Hu Shuisheng] quickly covered his mouth.
0:36:55|0:36:59|Upon hearing Commander Zhou urging him as well, Hu Shuisheng hesitated for a moment before speaking.
0:37:21|0:37:36|Although Xiulian was unwilling in her heart, she could only wait in place due to orders. The two of them quietly approached the Japanese sentry post. At the signal from Shuisheng, [Yu Mancang] shot a slingshot at the sentry. Seeing no response from the other side, he stood up and prepared to take action.
0:37:36|0:37:46|At the critical moment of the military attack, [He Hua] arrived in time to hold down the two men, using the gun to command the enemy's searchlight. In the meeting of [Yu Man Cang], he drew the bow with full force, aimed at the light bulb, and hit it with one shot.
0:37:59|0:38:10|Xiulian counterattacked and retreated, [Hu Shuisheng] was scared by the gunfire and hugged his head in the corner. Seeing this, the three of them were forced to join the battle and began to fight back.
0:38:28|0:38:37|In order to protect the injured team member, [Hu Shuisheng] and another person lured the enemy into a dense reed marsh, and [Commander Zhou] personally led the team to capture them.
0:38:44|0:38:52|No one emerged from the reeds. The crafty Monkey is very familiar with Mrs. [Liu].
0:39:21|0:39:35|After receiving the order, a soldier started a fire from the base of the reeds, while another soldier threw his torch directly into the lush reed bed. Now, we can see the flames rolling and thick smoke filling the entire reed bed.
0:39:35|0:39:43|The rocket wind grew stronger and soon reached the hiding place of the two, forcing them to constantly dodge the fire while fleeing.
0:39:48|0:39:54|Shuisheng forcibly dragged He Hua forward, and He Hua stopped after exhausting all her energy.
0:40:20|0:40:34|[Hu Shuisheng] carries [He Hua] and continues to run. On the other side, [Commander Zhou] looks coldly as the fire spreads. At the same time, the two of them rely on hollow reeds to sneak into the water, using the cover of the lake to successfully escape the encirclement of the Japanese army.
0:40:41|0:40:55|[Hu Shuisheng] plunged into the water, and when he resurfaced, he had a handful of mud in his hand, which he then evenly smeared on the faces of [He Hua] and himself. After the burning sensation subsided, the two swam towards the shore.
0:40:55|0:41:4|In the Japanese army headquarters, everyone returned empty-handed, with anger burning in [Sakata]'s chest. [Translator Liang], subordinate officers, and [Zhao Yangren] followed closely, feeling apprehensive.
0:41:5|0:41:26|He threw the gloves heavily onto the conference table, sat down immediately, suppressed the anger in his heart, and glared at [Zhao Yangren]. The three of them quickly lowered their heads and retreated in fear.
0:41:28|0:41:44|Commander Zhou and the rest of the anti-Japanese team are waiting for the return of Hu Shuisheng and the others. Yu Man Cang nervously looks back and forth, sometimes glancing at the team's flag, sometimes looking towards the path to Commander Zhou. After waiting for a long time without seeing their figures, Yu Man Cang hesitates for a moment.
0:41:58|0:42:11|In the county town, [Zhao Yangren] walked with a serious expression, wearing sunglasses and looking down. On the other side of the street, [Yu Mancang], who came to the town with Xiulian to gather information, was looking around and happened to notice [Zhao Yangren] walking alone.
0:42:11|0:42:27|He pulled Xiulian and hurried to the roadside stall to pretend to be a customer, seeing the other person getting closer and closer to him. The two quickly lowered their heads to avoid being noticed. [Zhao Yangren] stopped at the entrance of the alley, looked around but did not notice anything unusual, then turned and walked into the narrow alleyway.
0:42:27|0:42:44|[Yu Man Cang] saw someone disappear at the corner, hurriedly pulled the embroidered curtain and chased after, with half of his head sticking out behind the wall, closely watching [Zhao Yangren]. The embroidered curtain cautiously looked behind, and when the other party did not notice, the two continued to follow. After [Zhao Yangren] passed by, he stuck his head out from the wall and continued to stare intently.
0:42:44|0:42:53|The lush reeds grow out of the water, resembling an ocean. [He Hua] and [Hu Shuisheng] lay on the ground, their nearsighted jackets draped over the reeds, basking in the sun.
0:43:29|0:43:36|When it comes to happy memories of the past, [He Hua] suddenly got up and looked towards the water with a joyful expression.
0:44:2|0:44:12|After speaking, [He Hua] immersed herself in memories, and [Hu Shuisheng] casually noticed the necklace around her neck. After being shocked, [Hu Shuisheng] relaxed his brows and asked with a smile.
0:44:14|0:44:19|[He Hua] lowered her head to look at the necklace, lost in thought for a moment before speaking.
0:44:42|0:45:7|The two locked eyes, the atmosphere gradually becoming intense. [Hu Shuisheng] shyly changed the subject quickly. In the alley, [Yu Mancang] leaning against the wall, the small house in front of the banquet hall, Xiulian anxiously inquiring below. Inside the house, [Zhao Yangren], who had just finished enjoying the rain, stood up leisurely, buttoning up contentedly.
0:45:10|0:45:28|Upon hearing the woman's whimper, he turned around and burst into laughter.
0:45:33|0:45:48|At night, He Hua on the wall aimed at Zhao Yangren who had just stepped out of the house. Zhao Yangren howled in pain, scaring He Hua and Hu Bingkun away. In the bamboo pavilion, Commander Zhou held a meeting for the resistance team.
0:47:26|0:47:33|The sound of water grew louder, and He Hua quickly shouted to stop them and guide them forward. [Yu Mancang] reluctantly turned around.
0:48:4|0:48:18|After Hu Shuisheng finished speaking, he also realized his mistake. After a brief exchange of eye contact and sleeve signals, He Hua, follow the command.
0:48:53|0:49:13|[He Hua] arrived and found the temple courtyard empty. Instead of entering the main hall directly, she hid behind a stone pillar, carefully observing and looking around. After not detecting any potential danger, she pondered for a moment before heading towards the main hall. Throughout the process, she remained vigilant. As she was about to step over the threshold, she bumped into [Ban Tian] who had just come out of the hall.
0:49:13|0:49:19|[Ban Tian] glanced at [He Hua], who dared not look up beside him, hesitated briefly, and then walked towards the monk below the steps.
0:49:20|0:49:37|[He Hua], who narrowly escaped a disaster, did not leave directly, but hid under a tree watching the two men closely. Seeing the two men hesitantly conversing in front of the pavilion, a sense of doubt and unease surged in [He Hua]'s heart. Not long after, [Itada] put his hands together, bowed to the monk in gratitude, and then turned and left.
0:49:38|0:49:55|Waiting for [Itada] to completely disappear from her sight, [He Hua] entered the main hall with a sense of relief. After skillfully looking around, she walked through the Buddha statues and headed towards the depths of the main hall. As she was about to reach her destination, she still couldn't help but look back to see if there were any suspicious individuals following her.
0:49:55|0:50:4|After making sure there was no one else in the hall, [He Hua] quickly walked to the altar. Pretending to pay homage, she carefully observed if there were any unfamiliar persons around.
0:50:6|0:50:22|[He Hua]'s vigilant behavior caught the attention of the monks in the courtyard. One of them suspiciously crouched by the window, peering through the crack in the glass to monitor him. He pushed the incense burner with his left hand, reached in with his right hand to take out a piece of paper, and quickly left the temple.
0:50:22|0:50:33|Approaching the bridge pier by the river, He Hua looked around and made sure no one was paying attention to him before swiftly slipping into the archway. He put down the bamboo basket he was carrying, took out a piece of paper from his sleeve, and opened it to read.
0:50:41|0:50:59|[He Hua] immediately tore up the intelligence left by [Yu Mancang] after reading it, bent down to take out a student uniform from the bamboo basket on the ground, quickly changed into it, and then returned to the temple. The returning [He Hua] happened to run into the monk who had talked to [Bankfield], who was sneaking around the altar looking for something.
0:50:59|0:51:4|After a moment of contemplation, she turned and walked away, heading to the lakeside where [Yu Man Cang], who had been waiting for her for a long time, was.
0:51:5|0:51:14|Seeing him emerge from the dense reeds, He Hua immediately stood up, steadied the swaying boat, reached out to help him onto the small boat, and as the two got on board, the boatman began to row.
0:51:54|0:51:58|In the command post, the timid [Zhao Yangren] with bandaged arms looked towards [Ban Tian].
0:52:1|0:52:10|Seeing the other party feeling down, [Ban Tian] slowly walked to his side, placed his left hand on his right shoulder, and [Zhao Yangren] immediately lowered his head and stood up.
0:52:37|0:52:51|At these words, [Zhao Yangren] instantly felt a chill in his heart and looked to [Commander Zhou] for help.
0:53:48|0:53:52|[He Hua], after hearing [Hu Shuisheng]'s suggestion, pondered for a moment and then spoke.
0:54:41|0:54:51|Alright, the three of them quickly agreed and split up. [He Hua] returned to the base, while [Hu Shuisheng] and [Hu Bingkun] headed to the temple. The Japanese army held a meeting.
0:55:1|0:55:3|[Ban Tian] only touched the map once.
0:56:46|0:57:3|[Ban Tian] fell into contemplation, turned to look at [Zhao Yangren]. Inside the temple, [Yu Mancang] lifted his head to observe the situation in the hall, then sneaked into the main hall furtively. [Hu Shuisheng] stayed at the door to keep watch for him. Seeing the signal of safety from the other side, he walked attentively towards the direction of the incense burner.
0:57:3|0:57:8|Approaching the altar, he carefully inserted the note into the bottom of the incense burner, then pretended to leave.
0:57:9|0:57:22|When the store was empty, the monk who had been peeking through the cracks came to the altar and looked around. He then took out a piece of paper and immediately opened it to read. All of his actions were observed by [Yu Mancang], who was hiding behind a pillar in the store.
0:58:29|0:58:48|At the bamboo pavilion, the preparations are being carried out in an orderly and tense manner. Team members are fully focused on making their own weapons, and the modified landmines are handed to [He Hua] for inspection.
0:58:48|0:58:57|[He Hua] returned the landmine to his teammate, then turned and walked over to Xiulian, who was laying straw in the triangular guard post, and picked up straw to help fill the top.
0:59:15|0:59:29|At the city gate, the Japanese army is setting off to support Zhushan. The puppet army squad is clearing the way ahead, while [Zhao Yangren] sneaks into the heavy weapons infantry column and advances together. Among the entire troop, only Itada stands out riding a horse.
0:59:30|0:59:47|Ban Cang kept observing the large Japanese army that had just left the city gate from behind a tree. After a rough estimate, he turned and ran into the reed marsh. This unit was well-equipped, with not only the most common Type 38 rifles used by the Japanese army, but also two Type 89 grenade launchers and a Type 92 heavy machine gun.
0:59:47|0:59:53|Ban Cang ran forward quickly, with the march of [Sakata] not far ahead.
0:59:53|1:0:10|Relying on the advantage of the terrain, he shuttled through the little-known paths in the reeds, maintaining a high level of vigilance after entering the reed marsh. [He Hua] led the guerrillas to ambush the troops on the road that must pass through the paddy fields with a broad view on horseback.
1:0:10|1:0:21|Facing the enemy without a deep understanding and with a significant disparity in equipment between the two sides, even though hiding in the dark, the team members had to focus all their attention on the direction from which the enemy forces were coming.
1:0:22|1:0:37|He Hua was getting anxious as the enemy was nowhere to be seen. After carefully observing her surroundings and finding no trace of the enemy, she quietly moved towards the sound of water to lead another ambush team. Upon reaching the water's edge, He Hua crouched down.
1:1:9|1:1:14|The Japanese troops did not notice the guerrilla fighters who had already ambushed in the nearby reeds.
1:1:32|1:1:36|Seeing the enemy so close at hand and still unaware, the guerrilla fighters couldn't help but feel a bit restless.
1:1:40|1:1:58|[He Hua] calmly restrained his restless teammates, who could only watch as the enemy troops passed by them. Seeing [He Hua] so composed, the others had no choice but to obey orders and wait for the Japanese forces to reach the mine-laden area.
1:2:8|1:2:13|After witnessing Ban Tian falling off the horse unharmed, [He Hua] immediately issued the evacuation order.
1:2:36|1:2:41|Zhao Yangren, though unwilling, dared not disobey the order, so he could only look at his subordinates.
1:3:7|1:3:10|The sound of gunshots scared [Zhao Yangren] into running back quickly.
1:3:36|1:3:51|The guerrilla fighters were dodging shells, and the puppet army squad began searching for Lu Weicong. [Zhao Yangren] bravely shouted out.
1:4:44|1:4:57|[He Hua] quickly ran past [Hu Shuisheng] with two teammates towards the direction where they could intercept the [Bankfield] troops. The hurried [Bankfield] was suddenly stopped by [Zhao Yangren].
1:5:19|1:5:31|The commander of the New Fourth Army, Commander Zhou, immediately ordered an investigation into the reed marshes upon receiving intelligence from He Hua, who had no intention of harassing the guerrilla team for half a day.
1:5:48|1:6:0|After receiving the order, the New Fourth Army quickly assembled to support the guerrilla team. Under the leadership of [Yu Mancang], the troops ran forward in an orderly manner. While avoiding Japanese artillery shells, [Hu Shuisheng] and others were suddenly stopped by someone.
1:7:19|1:7:40|The Japanese army led by [Hu Yangren] and the puppet army squad are still searching for [He Hua] in the reed marshes. After wandering around for a while without seeing anyone, [Hu Yangren] becomes very angry. While walking through the reeds, he loses his footing and falls to the ground.
1:7:40|1:7:45|After standing up, he ruthlessly pushed away [Zhao Yangren] who was supporting him, and then turned to command his subordinates.
1:8:56|1:9:4|Hesitating for a moment, Ban Tian finally swung his knife towards [Zhao Yangren]. In an instant, the blood splattered on the reed leaves nearby.
1:9:22|1:9:24|[He Hua] and another team member helped the wounded soldier move forward with difficulty.
1:9:34|1:9:51|He Hua settled the wounded in a hidden patch of reeds, then turned and left the wounded behind, running onto the road without any reed cover. As he saw the Japanese soldiers chasing after him getting closer to the reed thicket where the wounded were hiding, he had no choice but to stop, raise his gun, and attract the enemy.
1:10:3|1:10:25|[He Hua] fell to the ground, struggling to crawl forward with her injured left leg. After firing the last bullet, she turned around and threw the gun into the lake, continuing to crawl forward. The unbearable pain in her left leg quickly spread throughout her body.
1:10:35|1:10:45|With only the strength left in his hands, he used the muddy grass on the shallow bank as a support point, exerting force to move his immobilized body.
1:10:55|1:11:12|[He Hua], who was lying unconscious on the ground, was rudely flipped over by two soldiers. They then dragged her forward by her arms, with her legs sliding on the shallow water. As dusk approached, the reeds, which had been battling the strong wind all day, had exhausted their energy and could only drift with the wind.
1:11:12|1:11:20|After successfully capturing He Hua, the Japanese soldiers, the troops continued to advance towards the mountain. Seeing no sign of stopping from the troops, Translator Liang hurriedly ran towards Commander Zhou.
1:12:14|1:12:24|The Japanese communication officer quickly ran over and handed the map to [Sakata]. The two translators stepped forward to help unfold it, and they immediately started studying it.
1:12:32|1:12:43|Hearing the footsteps in the grass, the team members raised their rifles. The guerrilla fighter hidden in the grass, upon seeing that it was their own people, immediately lowered their guard.
1:12:45|1:13:2|The New Fourth Army is still running non-stop on the way to support. Inside the thatched cottage, He Hua, who is tied to a stretcher, is still unconscious. Soldiers stand guard beside her. Commander Zhou and Translator Liang enter from outside. Seeing that He Hua is still not awake, Translator Liang says to Commander Zhou.
1:13:24|1:13:27|Upon hearing that [He Hua] was arrested, [Hu Shuisheng] completely lost his mind.
1:14:24|1:14:54|Speak up, the old man untied the gourd wine flask from his waist and opened the flat mouth. After taking a lonely sip, he evenly poured the remaining wine in the lake all over his body. Look, hehe, [Translator Liang] followed [Ban Tian] into the main house and explained to the guard at the door.
1:14:54|1:15:0|[Ban Tian] placed the military knife in his hand on the table and then sat down, gesturing for [Translator Liang] to sit across from him.
1:15:21|1:15:31|In the midst of confusion, a villager walked in and placed a bowl of vegetables mixed with white rice on the table gently.
1:16:31|1:16:45|The uncle pretending to be drunk successfully fooled the pseudo-soldiers guarding outside, continued to stagger towards the courtyard, then climbed lightly onto the window and looked inside.
1:16:45|1:16:59|The room full of resting Japanese soldiers startled the old man, who quickly walked towards another room. Inside the main room, [Sakata], who couldn't sleep, stared at the moon in a daze, sighed deeply, and then spoke.
1:17:16|1:17:23|Translator Liang left after receiving the order, and Yu Man Cang arrived with the New Fourth Army to meet up with Hu Shuisheng.
1:17:42|1:17:54|The uncle arrived at the house with two doorbells, looked inside through the crack of the door. He carefully checked for He Hua, suddenly, a gun barrel was pressed against the back of his head.
1:18:7|1:18:26|The correspondent received the order and turned to leave. The soldier guarding He Hua in the thatched cottage immediately perked up upon seeing Translator Liang. After questioning the soldier, Translator Liang turned and walked towards He Hua, who was still unconscious and tied to a stretcher.
1:18:28|1:18:47|He slowly approached to check on [He Hua]'s condition, seeing no signs of awakening, he had to stand by patiently. The stuffy room made him restless as he tugged at his tie, looking around absentmindedly. Just then, a sound came from [He Hua] lying on the ground.
1:19:0|1:19:18|[He Hua] tightly closed her eyes, frowning in pain, as the soldier quickly returned with water. Seeing the soldier squat down to feed [He Hua] water, [Translator Liang] turned around, putting away his serious expression, and walked away with some distress.
1:19:19|1:19:29|At this moment, he was in a dilemma, with his comrade captured by the Japanese army and no knowledge of the movements of the reinforcements, he could only carefully protect [He Hua] in this small house.
1:19:34|1:19:53|Hearing [He Hua] coughing from being choked by water, he immediately turned to look, realizing the inappropriateness of his actions after a moment, he turned back to continue fiddling with the candlestick. He understood that he had almost exposed himself because of his subconscious actions just now, so he took down the wine pot from the wall, poured alcohol into the bowl to divert attention.
1:19:53|1:20:2|With the alcohol pouring out of the bottle, his thoughts once again shifted to He Hua, who was coughing slightly on the ground, completely forgetting that his right hand was still pouring the wine.
1:20:7|1:20:16|By the time he reacted, the wine had already spilled onto the ground along with the moss and salt.
1:20:47|1:21:2|The soldier spat on by [He Hua] was about to step forward to reprimand, but was stopped by [Translator Liang] raising his hand, so he had to give up and return to his original position. Seeing that [He Hua] had already understood his meaning, before leaving, [Translator Liang] reminded the guard soldier once again.
1:21:44|1:21:47|Birds chirping. Birds chirping. Birds chirping. Birds chirping. Birds chirping.
1:22:41|1:22:43|Soldiers in the courtyard light torches.
1:22:58|1:23:7|After a brief moment of contemplation, [He Hua] voiced her thoughts. As the troops departed, Commander Zhou...
1:23:44|1:24:7|Under the intense gunfire, the Japanese soldiers were scattered and fleeing, only [Itada] and two soldiers were able to barely fight back. Under the suppression of machine gun fire, many Japanese soldiers fell before even stepping out of the courtyard.
1:25:2|1:25:29|In the thatched cottage, machine guns were firing under the command of [Commander Zhou]. Seeing that the enemy was too busy to notice him, [Translator Liang] hesitated for a moment, then quietly slipped away from behind him. Instead of leaving immediately, he drew his pistol, turned back to make sure [Commander Zhou] hadn't noticed, and then went to find [He Hua].
1:25:29|1:25:31|After being rescued by the guards, He Hua quickly untied Uncle Hu.
1:25:38|1:25:57|Two people lifted the stretcher and walked towards the outside of the house. Just as they took a few steps, they were suddenly stopped by [He Hua]. She aimed at a wooden stake with all her might and kicked it. The three quickly retreated, and as the alcohol-filled candle bowl fell, the house was instantly ignited.
1:26:0|1:26:8|Commander Zhou carefully observed through the telescope and saw that the lights were on in the thatched cottage, with thick smoke rising from the roof.
1:26:34|1:26:52|Ignoring the enemy's machine gun fire, the commando quickly climbed onto the roof, set up the machine gun, and covered his teammates. Amidst the charging shouts, numerous members of the Third Squad braved the bullet rain to carry thatched grass for a countercharge. Seeing the continuous fall of the New Fourth Army soldiers, [Hu Shuisheng] led his resistance team to quickly reinforce them.
1:26:54|1:27:17|In the midst of the Japanese machine gun fire, the group managed to tear open a gap, placing thatched grass on the dying embers to reignite the flames. The Japanese soldiers forced out by the fire in the backyard ran into the New Fourth Army as soon as they stepped out, instantly turning into several bodies resembling a hornet's nest.
1:27:18|1:27:28|Ban Tian was preparing to support the soldiers when he saw [Translator Liang] evacuating. Hit by a bullet, Ban Tian had to retreat back into the house.
1:27:41|1:27:58|The bugle sounded, and Commander Zhou led everyone to leap up. The escort team launched the final attack, with cannons roaring, smoke filling the air, and bullets flying. A few minutes later, the gunfire stopped, and the bodies of Japanese soldiers were scattered all over the field.
1:27:58|1:28:5|Seeing [Hu Shuisheng] leading everyone to kick open the door, Ban Tian threw away the machine gun and kept retreating, the sound of water growing louder and pressing closer step by step.
1:28:7|1:28:30|He Hua looked at Ban Tian with a murderous look in his eyes. Seeing no remorse from the other party, he took a step forward and shouted loudly. Ban Tian picked up a military knife and made a drawing sword gesture. Seeing the opponent rushing towards him with a drawn sword, Hu Shuisheng decisively opened fire. Looking at the fallen enemy, he spoke.
1:28:31|1:28:59|[Yu Mancang] opened his mouth and threw the sack towards [Ban Tian]. Under the sunlight, the shimmering reeds were glowing. After finishing organizing the battlefield, Commander Zhou found Hu Shuisheng. Upon hearing Hu Shuisheng's promise, Commander Zhou turned to face the villagers.
1:29:18|1:29:28|[He Hua] is lying on a stretcher, being carried over by team members, with [Translator Liang] following closely behind. [Commander Zhou] steps forward and anxiously asks the military doctor.
1:30:2|1:30:7|Under the command of [Commander Zhou], the New Fourth Army and the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla quickly saluted and departed.
1:30:14|1:30:20|The military medical team gradually moved away under the watchful eyes of everyone.
