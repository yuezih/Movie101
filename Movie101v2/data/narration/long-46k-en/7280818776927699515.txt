0:0:30|0:0:40|The movie starts with a concert of Zheng Lucheng's works in Beijing in 2002, where a group of children holding colorful balloons sing Mr. Zheng Lucheng's songs together.
0:2:32|0:2:51|As the song ends, the time is in the 1920s. When he was a child, [Zheng Lucheng] stood on the riverbank playing the violin, while his friends quietly admired around him. The scenery in the distance was beautiful and pleasant. But at that moment, a plane flew overhead, and the children all looked up at the sky.
0:2:54|0:3:11|Just as everyone was still in doubt, the missile under the plane's nose had already landed on the river bank. Sensing the danger, the children scattered and fled, while the young [Zheng Lucheng] grabbed his violin and hurriedly ran away. In this way, he ran all the way back home safely.
0:3:11|0:3:22|This is Yangnyeong Town, Gwangju City, South Jeolla Province, on the southern part of the Korean Peninsula. During his youth, [Zheng Lucheng] lived in this small village with his parents.
0:3:22|0:3:38|He returned to the village safely and first sneaked into Dr. An's house, wanting to return the violin while Dr. An was asleep, to prevent being caught for taking it secretly. After observing for a while, Zheng Lucheng carefully put the violin back in its place.
0:3:38|0:3:43|As he was about to turn and leave, he never expected to startle [Dr. An] after all.
0:3:44|0:3:59|Being stopped by Dr. Anbo's powerful voice, [Zheng Lucheng] felt as if he was frozen in place. Dr. Anbo turned his head to glance at [Zheng Lucheng] standing at the door, then leisurely stretched and slowly sat up. After regaining a bit of clarity, he spoke.
0:3:59|0:4:1|Hearing his name, [Zheng Lucheng] felt a tremor in his heart.
0:4:5|0:4:24|Zheng Lucheng stood still, realizing he couldn't deceive his way out this time. He could only slowly turn around in a posture of admitting his mistake, facing the doctor's reprimand. Seeing Lucheng's good attitude in admitting his mistake, [Dr. An] could only sigh deeply. He stood up slowly, picked up the violin placed on the table.
0:4:38|0:4:50|[Zheng Lucheng], listen, look up. Upon hearing this, [Dr. An] sighed, pacing back and forth in the room. After some contemplation, he spoke.
0:4:57|0:5:5|[Dr. An] heard determination and resolve in Lucheng's response from Green City. In response, he also made up his mind to teach this child well.
0:5:12|0:5:28|[Zheng Lucheng] listened and excitedly ran forward to kneel down and pay respects to the master. After paying respects, he left Dr. [An]â€™s residence in high spirits. At this moment, [Zheng Lucheng]'s mother was at home holding a wooden stick, continuously beating the clothes.
0:5:31|0:5:33|He ran over and knelt down beside his mother.
0:5:37|0:6:0|The mother did not stop her hands. Hearing Lvcheng acting coquettishly, the mother turned her head and lovingly touched his face. In the evening, the family sat together to have dinner.
0:6:5|0:6:9|The mother brought the steamed food from the pot to the dining table.
0:7:34|0:7:53|The father's scolding did not extinguish the enthusiasm of [Zheng Lucheng] for learning. The next day, as agreed, he came to study at Dr. [An]'s house. And during his hard study, the Japanese military police gradually infiltrated the village. These Japanese soldiers marched with deafening steps, swearing to destroy and trample on peace.
0:7:55|0:8:16|At this moment, [Zheng Lucheng] was completely unaware of the impending danger. Suddenly, a young villager rushed over to find [Lucheng] in a panic. Upon hearing the bad news, [Lucheng] immediately rushed home, with [Dr. An] following closely behind. At that moment, Japanese military police broke into [Zheng Lucheng]'s home.
0:8:35|0:8:47|At this moment, [Zheng Lucheng] is rushing home. When his second brother regains consciousness, he quickly catches up with the Japanese soldiers taking away their father. In desperation, he picks up a stick from the corner and is ready to fight the Japanese invaders.
0:8:55|0:9:7|But unexpectedly, after only a few steps, they were stopped by a Japanese officer next to them. The Japanese officer pointed a gun at [Zheng Lucheng]'s head, staring at him fiercely, making his sister tremble with fear.
0:9:11|0:9:39|At home, [Zheng Lucheng] died under the gun of the officer. When the mother heard the gunshot, she went back to check on [Zheng Lucheng]. At that moment, [Zheng Lucheng] arrived late. He ran over to check on his fallen brother. And so, the family lost two people in a row. The once happy and harmonious family became fragmented.
0:9:39|0:9:44|The next morning, the family planned to send the children away from the village.
0:10:16|0:10:38|At this moment, [Dr. An] also rushed over. Dr. An took out his previously treasured violin from his arms, intending to give it to [Zheng Lucheng] as a parting gift. [Zheng Lucheng] hesitated to accept such a valuable gift at first, but Dr. An was determined, and he could only accept it.
0:10:38|0:10:52|He looked at the teacher who had taught him before, then deeply bowed. At this moment, everyone didn't know how to face their emotions. This family had just experienced unimaginable hardships, yet they could only embrace silence.
0:10:54|0:11:13|And this sense of humiliation and hatred planted a seed in the heart of young [Zheng Lucheng]. In this way, [Zheng Lucheng] and his sister left the village and set out on the road. Every step they took, they would look back with deep affection at the beloved hometown, until the scenery disappeared from view.
0:11:14|0:11:26|Dr. An and the mother stayed in place, watching the children leave. The journey of the two of them was destined to be full of uncertainties and challenges. The journey left their hometown and arrived in China.
0:11:56|0:12:6|The atrocities of the Japanese spread continuously on this land of China, and everyone is struggling to survive in this turbulent era, with [Zheng Lucheng] being one of them.
0:12:10|0:12:26|[Zheng Lucheng] stood on the platform playing the violin for the students participating in the student movement. The crowd was inspired by the melodious music and started singing patriotic songs along. Among the crowd stood a strange woman, looking at [Zheng Lucheng] performing with a face full of contentment.
0:12:29|0:12:45|And at that moment, she also noticed the malicious gazes behind her. Not far away, several suspicious individuals were staring at the scene, and the worried woman looked towards [Zheng Lucheng] standing on the stage.
0:12:45|0:12:53|And at this moment, [Zheng Lucheng] was completely immersed in her own musical world, drifting outside the village ever since she left.
0:12:55|0:13:16|With the sound of the qin, his homesickness surged. He remembered Dr. An who taught him and gave him this qin, a kindness he would never forget in his life. Also, his mother and sister who stayed at home and shared hardships with him, these closest people supported him all the way.
0:13:16|0:13:35|After coming to China, he also experienced many political upheavals and participated in various student movements in his youth. In the fight for survival, he chose to join the army of the party to resist and contribute to the country. At the same time, he sought revenge against the Japanese who had harmed his family in the past.
0:13:36|0:13:58|At night, [Zheng Lucheng] finished his day's activities and was about to go home when three people suddenly blocked his way. [Zheng Lucheng] stopped in his tracks, the three individuals looked aggressive and full of malice. Upon closer inspection, they turned out to be the ones who had been monitoring [Zheng Lucheng] at the activity site during the day.
0:13:58|0:14:1|Three of them stepped forward and started punching and kicking [Zheng Lucheng].
0:14:5|0:14:23|They were just getting into it when a voice from the darkness sternly stopped them. A woman emerged from the shadows during the day. The woman and the coachman pulled out guns and aimed at the three men.
0:14:28|0:14:46|Three of them saw each other with guns and fled in panic. The woman caught up and checked on the fallen [Zheng Lucheng]. He seemed to be seriously injured, so she and the coachman lifted [Zheng Lucheng] onto the carriage and took him to her residence for the time being. The woman lived in a Western-style house that looked more exquisite in decoration.
0:14:46|0:14:56|She patiently tended to the wound of the fainting Zheng Lucheng. The intense pain woke Zheng Lucheng up from fainting. But even in such a state, the first thing she thought of was her qin.
0:15:3|0:15:8|He quickly got up to check his zither. [Zheng Lucheng] had a blue expression on his face.
0:15:29|0:15:36|He reached out for his violin, lost in thought. Upon hearing the news about his elder sister, [Zheng Lucheng] quickly rushed forward in excitement to inquire.
0:16:5|0:16:17|Upon hearing the question, the woman fell silent, not yet figuring out how to tell Zheng Lucheng about this matter. Hesitating, she turned and walked away, her back to Zheng Lucheng. After a moment of worry, she spoke up.
0:16:25|0:16:44|Upon receiving the bad news, [Zheng Lucheng] couldn't believe it at first, exclaiming in astonishment. His words were like a bolt from the blue, shattering his thoughts. [Mu Lan] took out an item carefully wrapped in a handkerchief from the drawer of the table, turned around, and handed it to the still shocked [Zheng Lucheng].
0:16:44|0:16:48|He sat down, gradually digesting this pain.
0:16:53|0:17:4|Wrapped carefully is a silver bracelet. Zheng Lucheng walks over slowly, examining it closely. A wave of sadness washes over him.
0:17:5|0:17:10|He couldn't control his emotions for a moment. Faced with this situation, [Mu Lan] spoke up.
0:17:27|0:17:32|And Zheng Lucheng, unable to suppress his anger, finally stood up and was about to leave.
0:17:53|0:18:0|Mu Lan stepped forward to stop him. Faced with Mu Lan's determination, he gradually calmed down.
0:18:28|0:18:40|The crackling of the phonograph interrupted their conversation. [Mu Lan] stepped forward to fix the phonograph, remaining silent in response to Zheng [Lucheng]'s question.
0:19:6|0:19:23|[Mu Lan] helped him tidy up a bit and smiled satisfactorily. He changed into his clothes and walked to a foreign-style house in a decent manner. He looked around first to make sure no one was following him, then turned and walked in. His experiences in participating in patriotic activities and student movements made him very cautious in everything.
0:19:23|0:19:33|At this moment, Zheng Lucheng had already developed a revolutionary consciousness. Upon arriving at the location and confirming it, he knocked on the door.
0:19:40|0:19:59|He took out the documents that could prove himself from the coat pocket. At night, Mu Lan was reading the newspaper at home when someone knocked on the door. Mu Lan put down the newspaper, got up and went to open the door. Upon opening the door, Zheng Lucheng walked in. He hung up his hat and took off his coat after entering.
0:21:54|0:21:59|They became comrades in the revolutionary journey. Not long after.
0:22:5|0:22:21|Two people walked together on the long road towards their sacred destination in their hearts. They stopped and looked at the scenery before them. Here is the Yellow River, on the banks of Yan'an.
0:22:29|0:22:50|The two stood dumbfounded, staring at the scene before them. Everywhere they looked, there were well-trained Eighth Route Army troops, on the hillside, in the fields, within the courtyard, all actively engaged in production work. They moved with a sense of urgency, working diligently and energetically, each person performing their duties and cooperating with one another.
0:22:51|0:23:2|The scene before the newcomer [Zheng Lucheng] was particularly shocking. He secretly made up his mind to make a career here. The two had just arrived in Yan'an and happened to pass by a choir rehearsal.
0:23:3|0:23:15|Suddenly, [Zheng Lucheng] seemed to have sensed something and stood still. After the choir finished singing, the girls in the choir brought out a bouquet of flowers.
0:23:18|0:23:26|[Zheng Lucheng] suddenly realized that this person was his childhood mentor. The two of them embraced each other excitedly.
0:23:37|0:23:45|They had been separated for many years, but never expected to meet again here. In the end, they returned to their accommodation to rest.
0:24:8|0:24:13|Old Zhang turned around and sat down, picking up the nearby microphone and asked.
0:24:49|0:25:4|The two had a pleasant conversation and agreed to collaborate in the future. [Mu Lan] has become busy since arriving in Yan'an, throwing herself into revolutionary tasks without stopping. At this moment, [Zheng Lucheng] reunited with [Dr. An] and talked about the past.
0:25:15|0:25:19|Dr. Anbo sighed deeply after listening, shaking his head at the dark world of the Forbidden City.
0:26:35|0:26:37|After listening to these words, [Zheng Lucheng] fell into contemplation.
0:27:1|0:27:5|This is the real great poet, from the Yan'an Lu Xun Academy of Arts, [Mu Lan].
0:27:21|0:27:30|[Old Monitor] loves lively atmosphere, he is the life of the party, a lone hero who is not drunk when everyone else is, constantly toasting and exchanging cups. The group of people sat around him.
0:28:18|0:28:33|When Mulan was mentioned, everyone's faces darkened instantly. Zheng Lucheng, unaware of the situation, asked in confusion. After much consideration, they decided to tell him the truth - Mulan's husband, Comrade Yang Wu.
0:28:41|0:28:51|[Zheng Lucheng] was quite shocked by this, and [Mu Lan] had been generous to him, serving as a guide in his revolutionary career. However, [Mu Lan]'s injury this time deepened his hatred towards the Japanese even more.
0:28:53|0:29:10|He got up and left the crowd, searching everywhere for Mu Lan's figure. At this time, Mu Lan was sitting on a secluded hillside, digesting the pain alone. After searching around, Zheng Lucheng finally found Mu Lan on the hillside.
0:29:12|0:29:27|Mu Lan heard someone calling her, which woke her up from her sorrowful state. She wiped away the tears on her face and tidied up her haggard appearance. [Zheng Lucheng] sat down behind her, wanting to comfort her, but not knowing how to start.
0:29:36|0:29:44|Mu Lan, upon hearing these words, although the sadness still lingered, her tightly furrowed brows gradually relaxed.
0:29:58|0:30:1|Mu Lan at this moment recalled the heroic deeds of her husband.
0:30:9|0:30:24|[Mulan], who sacrificed herself for the revolutionary cause of all people, is a true hero. A mix of sadness and pride intertwined in her heart, feeling a myriad of emotions. She lowered her head and smiled with contentment.
0:30:28|0:30:49|The glorious sacrifice of her husband made [Mu Lan] even more determined to dedicate herself to the revolutionary cause. Zheng Lucheng was deeply moved after hearing about [Mu Lan]'s husband's heroic deeds, and her sacrifice inspired more people to join the revolutionary cause.
0:30:49|0:30:55|Despite this, [Mu Lan] still found it hard to accept her husband's departure. Overwhelmed with emotions, she began to cry uncontrollably.
0:30:59|0:31:12|Zheng Lucheng looked at the crying Mu Lan, not knowing what to do, could only sit behind her silently sharing the pain of losing her loved one. She turned her head to look into the distance, the flames of revenge growing in her heart.
0:31:15|0:31:23|It wasn't until evening that Zheng Lucheng accompanied Mu Lan back to their residence. Inside the house, everyone was still waiting for the two to return.
0:31:28|0:31:55|Everyone expressed deep sympathy for [Mu Lan]'s ordeal. [Mu Lan] embraced [Mo Ye], and the comrades in Yan'an were constantly thinking of the heroes who sacrificed in battle. They all gathered together to comfort the grieving [Mu Lan].
0:32:2|0:32:7|Mo Ye's words made Mu Lan recall her husband's past.
0:32:27|0:32:51|[Mo Ye] turned around and picked up the package that had been prepared on the table, carefully handing it to [Mu Lan]. [Mu Lan] reached out her hand and took the keepsake. Fate is unpredictable, things change, this is the only thing left by her husband. And this originally light object has now become incredibly heavy.
0:32:51|0:32:53|The next day, [Zheng Lucheng] was watching the female soldiers training.
0:33:5|0:33:9|At this moment, [Old Monitor] and [Dr. An] came over and found [Zheng Lucheng].
0:33:33|0:33:35|[Zheng Lucheng] looked incredulous.
0:34:29|0:34:49|Since that's the case, [Zheng Lucheng] had to comply with the arrangement and join the filming crew. The female soldiers were rehearsing a performance of Ansai waist drums, their movements were uniform, striking out rapid and rhythmic drumbeats. With the changes in the drumming rhythm, their movements became more expansive, stepping lively with enthusiastic dance steps.
0:34:49|0:34:55|The double hammers striking the waist drum, with beautiful tassels flipping up and down, are pleasing to the eye and extremely exciting.
0:34:57|0:35:5|And at this moment, [Zheng Lucheng] and [Dr. An] arrived to watch. Seeing such a wonderful performance, he was momentarily mesmerized.
0:35:10|0:35:13|Everyone stopped what they were doing.
0:36:2|0:36:11|Arriving in the new environment, [Zheng Lucheng] plans to make a name for himself here. In the village, he sees a group of children sitting together singing and playing.
0:36:57|0:37:8|[Zheng Lucheng] constantly visits the village, getting familiar with the local people, truly embodying the principle of coming from the masses and returning to the masses. At night, while [Zheng Lucheng] is working on his creation with a lamp lit, [Old Monitor] walks in.
0:37:44|0:37:52|After placing the flowers, [Old Monitor] sat across from [Zheng Lucheng], then as if he had discovered something, he asked in confusion.
0:38:5|0:38:13|The Old Monitor widened his eyes in surprise and counted on the notebook with his hand.
0:38:26|0:38:28|The Old Monitor smiled kindly.
0:38:36|0:38:44|The next day in class with the female students, [Zheng Lucheng] was putting up Yan Shuiyao's music score on the blackboard.
0:39:30|0:39:51|After class, the female soldiers returned to the dormitory in groups, humming the song they had just learned. Along the way, they chatted and laughed, showing the vigor of youth. When they returned to the dormitory to rest, the captain noticed the flowers and novel on the table. The title of the novel was "Miss Tong Bo". The female soldiers in the same dormitory noticed something strange.
0:40:52|0:41:8|After hearing this, everyone stood up and began to prepare. The captain also distributed the washed fruits to everyone. In the evening bonfire party, everyone sat around together.
0:41:28|0:41:33|After Mr. Xian Xinghai finished speaking, the audience applauded enthusiastically, and next it was [Zheng Lucheng]'s turn to speak.
0:41:44|0:41:50|Amidst the applause, she picked up the violin and walked onto the stage, with the female soldiers below eagerly awaiting [Zheng Lucheng]'s performance.
0:42:21|0:42:30|During the performance by [Zheng Lucheng], he reminisces about his childhood, with the song filled with his longing for his hometown and mother.
0:42:55|0:43:8|If all family members were still alive, then [Zheng Lucheng] would definitely be a happy person. He would think countless times about his second brother, second sister, father, and mother, remembering the warm afternoons when the family sat together.
0:43:57|0:44:4|[Zheng Lucheng]'s wonderful singing and simple emotional expression touched everyone present, and the scene erupted in enthusiastic applause.
0:44:7|0:44:16|Even Mr. Xian Xinghai himself highly praised Zheng Lucheng's performance. After the bonfire party, Zheng Lucheng and the female soldiers returned to their accommodation together.
0:44:41|0:44:47|Amidst laughter and chatter, everyone dispersed. Although it was late at night, Captain [Ding Xuesong] was still studying under the lamplight.
0:45:7|0:45:22|Previously, she found a bookmark in the book with a drawing of a person playing the violin. [Ding Xuesong] was so engrossed in it that she didn't notice the female soldier slowly approaching behind her.
0:45:30|0:45:43|The female soldier quickly bent over and leaned close to his ear. Seeing the captain ignoring her, the female soldier began to disturb him from reading. After her mischief failed, the female soldier could only give up and leave [Ding Xuesong] alone to continue reading.
0:45:44|0:46:0|The next day, [Zheng Lucheng] sat on the hillside writing a song, while the female soldiers in the distance worked by the river, laughing and causing her to look up and gaze ahead. Some people in the front were also grooming and wiping horses on the riverbank, creating a scene of joy and laughter.
0:46:2|0:46:19|He turned his head to look at the riverbank again. The joyful atmosphere did not slow down the pace of work, but allowed everyone to immerse themselves in it. People could truly feel happiness in their labor. This scene of joy and the enthusiastic work environment deeply moved [Zheng Lucheng].
0:46:19|0:46:29|With this, he was suddenly inspired, standing up and looking into the distance, a strange emotion beginning to brew. [Zheng Lucheng] ran to find [Mo Ye] sister.
0:46:58|0:47:8|After speaking, he hurriedly found [Old Monitor]. In the kitchen, he poured firewood for [Old Monitor] and helped with emergency cooking.
0:48:34|0:48:52|[Zheng Lucheng] happily reached a cooperation with others and then embarked on his intense and continuous creation. This time, the song created by [Zheng Lucheng] is the well-known "Yan'an Ode" sung by generations. This song was composed in 1938, with magnificent and uplifting music.
0:48:52|0:48:54|The lyrics are catchy and profound.
0:48:55|0:49:14|In this song, lyricism and combativeness are intertwined, with the author's deep love and praise for the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an, providing great spiritual inspiration for the revolutionary soldiers. Even the most ordinary people, after listening to it, are deeply moved and cannot forget it for a long time.
0:49:14|0:49:18|This is why this song is so classic and has been passed down to this day.
0:50:19|0:50:27|A majestic and magnificent ancient city,
0:51:37|0:51:49|Chinese subtitle volunteer [Li Zongsheng].
0:52:12|0:52:31|The song performance is over, and the enthusiasm of the crowd is completely ignited. [Zheng Lucheng] solemnly salutes the officials in the audience, completing the curtain call. The people below all stand up, raising their hands in celebration. They lift [Zheng Lucheng] over their heads, continuously tossing him into the air.
0:52:33|0:52:42|The crowd at the scene was extremely enthusiastic, with [Zheng Lucheng] becoming the most beloved person. Life returned to calm, and [Zheng Lucheng] went to the river to catch fish.
0:53:0|0:53:16|Carrying the fish that was just caught, [Zheng Lucheng] coaxed Xiao Qu to find [Ding Xuesong]. Just as they reached the door, she noticed a group of female soldiers tuning new musical instruments in the courtyard. After observing for a while, she walked in quickly. However, it took a while for the female soldiers in the courtyard to notice her.
0:54:10|0:54:18|The crowd dispersed, leaving only [Zheng Lucheng] and [Ding Xuesong]. After the female soldiers had all entered the kitchen, she spoke.
0:54:20|0:54:41|[Zheng Lucheng] followed suit and entered the room with [Ding Xuesong]. At this moment, a soldier with a medal on his chest was riding a horse on the road. He crossed high mountains and passed through the bustling city at sunset. When he arrived home, he excitedly pushed open the door, saying, "I'm home." It turned out to be the son of [Old Monitor], coming home to visit him.
0:54:41|0:54:50|After a while, [Old Monitor] walked out of the kitchen with a look of surprise on his face.
0:55:20|0:55:24|After the end, [Zheng Lucheng] went to watch the children perform a play.
0:56:29|0:56:33|During the performance, someone suddenly ran over. Upon receiving the news, everyone immediately set off.
0:56:40|0:56:48|A group of people rushed into the room in a state of anxiety and saw [Mu Lan], who was covered in injuries. Everyone gathered around the bed.
0:56:52|0:56:54|Mu Lan is very weak at this moment.
0:57:10|0:57:12|[Zheng Lucheng] nodded with relief.
0:57:41|0:57:43|[Ding Xuesong] took out a stack of papers from [Mu Lan]'s pocket.
0:58:2|0:58:13|[Zheng Lucheng] carefully pondered the lyrics as if he had found a treasure. Afterwards, he hurried to the home of the [Old Monitor].
0:58:49|0:59:2|The river flowing down the mountain is no longer water, but blood. The people at the dining table heard such a cruel story and all lowered their heads.
0:59:5|0:59:9|He pursed his lips and continued to speak.
0:59:19|0:59:46|There was a soldier with a bayonet stuck in his back, but he still tightly held onto the throat of the enemy without letting go. Another soldier had both legs blown off by a bomb, indicating that he crawled over to seize the enemy's machine gun. Behind him, there was a long trail of blood.
1:0:19|1:0:24|At this moment, [Old Monitor] walked in with food in hand. Everyone turned their heads.
1:0:55|1:1:9|The heavy story made everyone lose their appetite. The next day, [Zheng Lucheng] was creating in his room, while [Old Monitor] was cooking and dozing off on the side. The pot was still cooking, and the room was filled with smoke.
1:1:9|1:1:15|But [Zheng Lucheng] was not affected at all, immersed in his own music.
1:1:47|1:1:49|As soon as the words fell, he hurriedly ran out in a panic.
1:2:19|1:2:21|Zheng Lucheng finds Ding Xuesong.
1:2:31|1:2:40|After the instructions were given, the two of them left together, and [Xiao Douzi] took over to continue the training in place of [Ding Xuesong].
1:2:59|1:3:18|[Ding Xuesong] looked at [Zheng Lucheng] with a puzzled expression. His eyes softened. Seeing [Zheng Lucheng]'s clumsy performance, he couldn't help but smile and lower his head.
1:3:57|1:3:59|This is the motivational part of the song.
1:4:20|1:4:24|[Zheng Lucheng]'s confusion made [Ding Xuesong] a little nervous.
1:4:42|1:4:45|This conversation dispelled the doubts of [Ding Xuesong].
1:5:4|1:5:17|Zheng Lucheng shook her head while tearing up the song she had written earlier. She crumpled the paper into a ball in her hand, clearly disappointed in herself. Ding Xuesong spoke up at this moment.
1:5:59|1:6:5|Then you... [Old Monitor] is sweeping the yard, when his son comes out of the house.
1:6:29|1:6:35|At this moment, [Ding Xuesong] happened to come for a visit.
1:7:55|1:7:58|At this moment, [Ding Xuesong] took out a pair of new shoes from behind and handed them to [Old Monitor].
1:8:5|1:8:17|After speaking, before [Old Monitor] could react, he ran out the door. At the same time, [Zheng Lucheng], who was sitting on the hillside contemplating, was dragged from behind and rolled down the hill. He looked up and said at the bottom of the slope.
1:8:21|1:8:23|Both of them were very excited to see each other this time.
1:8:36|1:8:39|[Old Zhang] hesitated for a moment before deciding to repay first.
1:8:43|1:8:47|The Old Monitor stood up and walked forward. Zheng Lucheng followed from behind.
1:9:40|1:9:45|As soon as [Zheng Lucheng]'s song started, it spread throughout the barracks, positions, and trenches.
1:9:56|1:10:10|The two of them walked together for a long distance. During this time, [Zheng Lucheng] started reading the poems written by [Old Monitor], his excitement evident in his eyes. Along the way, they kept discussing composition, lyrics, and the heroic deeds that had taken place on the battlefield.
1:10:11|1:10:25|The deep and efficient communication became the soil for the successful composition of this song. In the evening, the people who hadn't gathered for a long time sat around and started singing together. Seeing this scene, [Xian Xinghai] also came out of the house with a cup to join them.
1:11:52|1:12:4|The crowd burst into laughter after hearing this, causing the two to awkwardly lower their heads. In response, [Xian Xinghai] modestly shook his head and whispered.
1:12:46|1:12:51|A grand chorus of the Yellow River ignited the anti-Japanese enthusiasm of thousands of Chinese people.
1:13:1|1:13:4|[Xian Xinghai] and [Zheng Lucheng] were walking on the riverbank.
1:14:7|1:14:16|However, you seem to lack a kind of leisurely heart to listen to the sea, [Zheng Lucheng] said earnestly.
1:15:0|1:15:4|Xian Xinghai stopped in his tracks, turned around and looked at [Zheng Lucheng].
1:15:42|1:15:44|[Ding Xuesong] and [Xiao Douzi] are milking sheep in the yard.
1:16:21|1:16:30|Originally, the goat milk was meant to be delivered to the injured [Mu Lan]. [Zheng Lucheng] and [Ding Xuesong] came with [Xian Xinghai] to visit [Mu Lan].
1:18:11|1:18:26|Looking at the gun, [Zheng Lucheng] hesitated. With the words spoken, he took the gun willingly. The group left the ward after visiting [Mu Lan].
1:18:33|1:18:46|Xian Xinghai left first, leaving only Ding Xuesong and Zheng Lucheng. More wounded soldiers were constantly being brought to the hospital outside, indicating the fierce battle at the front line. The two of them walked and chatted along the way.
1:19:43|1:19:50|[Ding Xuesong] heard and became shy. But, but I... This sudden confession made him secretly happy, and he decisively asked.
1:20:15|1:20:23|Although the two have long had feelings for each other, this time they finally expressed their love. They are now committed to each other for life, with tears of joy in their eyes.
1:20:25|1:20:43|Suddenly, the distant sound of a lively mountain song for the college entrance examination could be heard. They, who were originally immersed in joy, were attracted by this song. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a farmer herding sheep on the mountain. And at this moment, the two of them seemed to make the same decision tacitly, to get married.
1:20:43|1:20:48|There is no need for communication. They just ran forward hand in hand.
1:20:49|1:21:0|Comrades along the coast held a grand wedding for the newlyweds, and every corner of the venue was filled with joy. In the midst of the warm atmosphere, [Old Monitor] stepped forward and addressed the audience below.
1:21:17|1:21:21|First, at this moment, [Xian Xinghai] steps onto the stage and greets everyone.
1:21:40|1:21:56|The atmosphere in the venue was ignited again, and amidst cheers, the two of them walked out slowly. They awkwardly accepted the blessings that came their way, but the joy on their faces was hard to conceal. Even the injured [Mu Lan] came to congratulate them.
1:22:22|1:22:29|Two young comrades brought wine for Zheng Lucheng and Ding Xuesong. They exchanged wine glasses with each other, considering it as a toast.
1:22:42|1:22:49|Knowing the news from [Old Monitor], [Zheng Lucheng] felt relieved. The two of them raised their heads and drank a toast, showing their empty cups to everyone.
1:22:55|1:23:4|They each took out a gift prepared in advance from their own pockets. [Ding Xuesong] gave [Zheng Lucheng] a pen, while [Zheng Lucheng] gave [Ding Xuesong] a bracelet.
1:23:11|1:23:30|Amidst the enthusiastic cheers, the show began. Dr. An was in charge of playing the drums, with a whole Chinese orchestra behind him, making the lineup truly luxurious. Zheng Lucheng and Ding Xuesong sat on the stage, ready to watch the performance. At this moment, three dancers entered, with Xiao Douzi leading the dance.
1:23:30|1:23:38|They danced the traditional Korean dance, also the dance from [Zheng Lucheng]'s hometown. Accompanied by melodious music, the three of them danced gracefully and relaxed.
1:23:39|1:24:3|The power of dance always runs through the charm, combining light footsteps with stretched upper body movements, as natural as breathing. The overall momentum sinks and then quickly rises, showing the beauty of traditional Korean dance with the arms of the crane style, the body of the lamb style, and the steps of the tiger style.
1:24:3|1:24:6|The emotional expression is so intense that it is breathtaking.
1:24:8|1:24:19|While everyone was celebrating the wedding, [Old Monitor] was still grinding flour in the yard, preparing dinner early for everyone. The wedding continued, and people's emotions were also getting better.
1:24:21|1:24:36|Comrades performing and playing were all enjoying themselves in the cheerful atmosphere. Almost everyone here temporarily forgot what kind of era they were in. The long period of peaceful life had made everyone accustomed to this rhythm.
1:24:36|1:24:43|With that, they temporarily set aside their personal grudges and focused on the wedding amidst the ongoing war.
1:24:44|1:25:0|In the harsh reality, this brief romance appears particularly precious. Coincidentally, at this moment, a Japanese fighter plane flew overhead. The [Old Monitor] outside the prison camp was the first to spot the plane.
1:25:4|1:25:7|At this moment, everyone attending the wedding also noticed something unusual.
1:25:14|1:25:25|People were awakened from the beautiful illusion at this moment, and Japanese planes began to drop bombs after circling overhead for a while. The bombs fell like rain on the places where people lived, causing heavy casualties in an instant.
1:25:30|1:25:49|In the chaos, people hurriedly evacuated from the wedding scene. Ordinary folks on the street also scattered and fled, avoiding the enemy planes of the Japanese army. [Tiedan] rushed to [Old Monitor]'s house in a panic, with everyone following behind. Unfortunately, the inevitable happened, and [Old Monitor] was hit by a bomb dropped by the Japanese army.
1:25:49|1:25:53|Son [Tiedan] and the hastily arriving crowd were unable to save [Old Monitor].
1:26:13|1:26:24|At this moment, [Old Monitor] had already stopped breathing, and everyone's emotions shifted from great joy to deep sorrow in an instant, unable to accept [Old Monitor]'s departure.
1:26:24|1:26:36|The grieving crowd surrounded the body of [Old Monitor], crying uncontrollably. Throughout his life, [Old Monitor] was strong-willed, never showing any fear even when facing the bullets of the Japanese invaders. He walked through his life as a revolutionary with honor.
1:26:37|1:27:1|[Zheng Lucheng] led everyone in taking off their hats to pay tribute, with [Ding Xuesong] by his side. "Speak," she leaned against [Zheng Lucheng]'s shoulder and sobbed softly. At this moment, the injured [Mu Lan] also rushed over from the wedding scene. Despite her difficulty in walking, she insisted on coming to visit.
1:27:3|1:27:13|The crowd gathered together to bid farewell to [Old Monitor]. He was the oldest among the soldiers, but his patriotic heart was as fervent as any young warrior.
1:27:15|1:27:28|All the soldiers gathered by the turbulent Yellow River to bid farewell. After seeing off the [Old Monitor], the young soldiers were also ready to head to the front line. [Zheng Lucheng], [Ding Xuesong], [Xiao Douzi], [Dr. An], and others went to the front line together to provide support.
1:27:28|1:27:36|The war was particularly fierce, with countless soldiers being carried down from the front, each one covered in blood and flesh, their injuries severe and hard to heal.
1:27:37|1:27:55|On the battlefield, gunfire and explosions never cease, and the dense artillery fire composes a cruel symphony on this land. Zheng Lucheng watches the wounded soldiers bleeding, feeling heart-wrenching. He rushes to the battlefield to save people, completely disregarding his own safety.
1:27:55|1:28:4|They were transporting one car after another of wounded soldiers, with artillery fire falling nearby. At this moment, Zheng Lucheng saw a familiar figure running around in the distance.
1:28:7|1:28:25|Recognizing him, he rushed into the enemy's artillery position to rescue. At this moment, [Dr. An] followed closely behind. With the cover of our firepower, Zheng [Lucheng] and [Dr. An] successfully rescued Tie Dai. Just as the artillery was injuring people, a new round of assault broke out on the battlefield.
1:28:26|1:28:48|The brave soldiers fought fiercely on the battlefield, and at this moment, a wounded soldier fell to the ground, right in the most dangerous front line. Zheng Lucheng saw this and bravely volunteered. He left An Boshi behind and rushed forward, with explosions going off behind him. Zheng Lucheng arrived at the battlefield but got trapped.
1:28:51|1:29:7|Seeing [Zheng Lucheng] surrounded, [Dr. An] disregarded his own safety and rushed forward, enduring the bombardment all the way, in a thrilling moment. Just then, a shell landed right beside [Dr. An]. With a deafening roar, [Dr. An] fell straight down.
1:29:13|1:29:30|Seeing the situation on the battlefield was dire, [Ding Xuesong] rushed to the front line with [Xiao Douzi]. As the two were charging forward, a Japanese soldier who had been lying on the ground suddenly got up and fired a shot at [Xiao Douzi] from behind, hitting him in the back. [Xiao Douzi] was shot and fell to the ground.
1:29:34|1:29:50|[Ding Xuesong] heard the gunshots and turned around to find [Xiao Douzi] lying on the ground, shot. At that moment, the frontline soldiers launched a new fierce attack. [Ding Xuesong] charged forward with the soldiers, and decisively killed the Japanese soldier who had previously ambushed [Xiao Douzi].
1:29:50|1:29:58|The gunfire was still constantly bombing, [Zheng Lucheng] signaled to the gunner, preparing to move backwards. But at that moment, the heart-wrenching charge signal sounded.
1:30:0|1:30:18|Thousands of Eighth Route Army soldiers rode out from the rear on horseback, wielding large knives and shouting loudly as they charged into the battlefield. The passion of this battle completely infected Zheng Lucheng, making him realize clearly why it was said that they were an invincible team.
1:30:18|1:30:24|In the face of such brave and fearless warriors, even with all their abilities, the Japanese invaders could not shake us in the slightest.
1:31:23|1:31:40|Returning from the battlefield to the coast, [Zheng Lucheng] began to revise the "Eight Route Army March". With the experience of going to the front line battlefield, he finally had a real sense of war. Whenever he thought of those Eight Route Army soldiers who sacrificed their lives on the battlefield, his excitement was hard to contain.
1:31:40|1:31:48|He turned these feelings of indignation into musical notes, rewriting the "Eight Route Army March", and this newly created song is majestic and resounding.
1:31:50|1:32:8|The song praises and showcases the fearless spirit of the Eighth Route Army soldiers. In addition to the majestic momentum in the melody, there is also a vibrant vitality. This song closely follows the marching pace of [the Eighth Route Army], in sync with the victorious rhythm, like a song played on the land of the motherland.
1:32:8|1:32:14|This song resounds on every battlefield where the fires of war rage, sung by every soldier of the [Eighth Route Army].
1:32:16|1:32:35|In the future, this song "March of the [Eighth Route Army]" was also renamed "March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army". In the place where the red flag flies, moving towards the victory of the whole country, towards the liberation of the people, times have changed. Today's Chinese People's Liberation Army, even with modern equipment and new military uniforms.
1:32:35|1:32:38|The combination with this song is still so harmoniously unified.
1:32:39|1:32:59|In the struggle for national independence and human liberation, no matter in which era, this is a very simple and sincere vision. This song is not grandiose rhetoric, but a fitting expression of the people's aspirations and patriotic feelings. It is precisely because of this song that it can stand the test of time and be widely circulated.
1:32:59|1:33:6|Today's China is prosperous and strong, entering a new era of running, which is a magnificent scene in history.
1:33:8|1:33:32|In this way, we, as we are now, are enough to comfort the revolutionary predecessors who shed blood and sweat. In 1988, the Central Military Commission issued an order to designate "March of the Volunteers" as the national anthem of the People's Liberation Army of China. Comrade [Zheng Lucheng] passed away in Beijing on December 7, 1976, at the age of 62.
