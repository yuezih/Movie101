0:4:8|0:4:18|The story begins at the Fox Clan's residence in Qing Qiu. At the border of the sky, the Monkey Immortal and the Squirrel Immortal are fighting over a piece of food.
0:4:26|0:4:44|Seeing [Bai Qian] running towards the distance, the monkey fairy scratched his ear and cheek, reached out his arm to grab a thin vine above his head, leaped onto a tree branch and transformed back into his true form as a monkey. After waiting for the injured squirrel fairy to catch up, they chased after [Bai Qian] together. The land fairy was squatting on the ground, carefully examining the mushrooms he had just picked.
0:4:44|0:5:3|He saw Monkey Immortal in a hurry and couldn't help but chuckle, then transformed into his true form. He had a graceful figure, handsome face, and was covered with round spots. Led by Squirrel Immortal, he ran towards Monkey Immortal. [Bai Qian]'s black hair floated elegantly, and her long skirt billowed behind her as she moved.
0:5:3|0:5:8|Running along the way, he encountered a fallen tree stump, leaped joyfully and transformed into a nine-tailed fox.
0:5:9|0:5:28|The fluffy tail was raised high, the body moved lightly, and the soft fur of the tattoo fluttered with the wind, looking disdainful and charming. The Monkey Immortal wandered through the forest with the help of vines, quickly catching up to [Bai Qian]. The Wolf Immortal also refused to be outdone, running wild in the forest, while not far away, the Rice Valley was also running in the woods.
0:5:28|0:5:32|Mo Yuan is a tree spirit who absorbs the essence of the sun and moon to cultivate into human form.
0:5:38|0:5:43|[Bai Qian] turned a deaf ear and ran back to her residence after a brief sprint.
0:6:16|0:6:22|Mi Gu handed Bai Qian the invitation sent by the East Sea Water King, and Bai Qian looked at it for a while.
0:7:29|0:7:45|The rice fields have been harvested, and winter is approaching. [Bai Qian] finally decides to visit the East Sea Dragon Palace. A giant jellyfish swims up to [Bai Qian] with the waves. It fully extends its umbrella-like body, and once [Bai Qian] steps onto it steadily, it retracts its umbrella.
0:7:46|0:7:57|Wrapped in [Bai Qian], the whole figure resembled a balloon, with tendrils trailing behind swaying as she floated towards the Dragon Palace in the East Sea.
0:7:57|0:8:14|In the Eastern Sea, one of the Four Seas, the scenery is wonderfully beautiful. Mountains, lakes, and sea reefs are colorful, with marvelous little fish swimming among the gorgeous coral bushes. At a glance, there are endless varieties of coral bushes. Suddenly, a magnificent Dragon Palace appears before the eyes.
0:8:21|0:8:25|She furrowed her brows, covered her eyes with her hand, and quickly put on the ribbon prepared by Mi Gu.
0:9:0|0:9:3|Two fairies were tripped by [Bai Qian] using a little trick.
0:9:11|0:9:16|[Bai Qian] had already left the main hall and came to the Coral Garden alone.
0:9:21|0:9:31|Speak up, he finished the last sip of wine in the jug and angrily threw it away. [Bai Qian] turned her head and saw a little boy.
0:9:54|0:10:4|[Bai Qian] couldn't help but laugh when she heard him say that. [Bai Qian] got up and followed the little sticky rice ball to a secluded coral thicket.
0:10:15|0:10:24|[Bai Qian] searched everywhere in the Coral Maze, but couldn't find any trace of her. Little did she know, a woman disguised as a shrimp soldier and crab general had kidnapped the dumpling.
0:10:24|0:10:34|Halfway, the fan that was taken away by the dumplings fell down. [Bai Qian] was furious and struck the person on the shoulder and neck, causing the person to drop the child and almost fall to the ground.
0:10:47|0:11:0|Unexpectedly, at this moment, Tuanzi picked up the fan on the ground and gently waved it in the direction of the two. Suddenly, a strong wind rose, causing [Xuan Nv] to escape in the chaos. When [Bai Qian] realized this, the alliance took the fan back from her hands.
0:11:2|0:11:16|Tuanzi lowered her head, her face full of grievances. [Bai Qian] mistakenly thought the newcomer was once again the Ghost Tribe [Xuan Nv] in disguise, so she spoke coldly to her.
0:11:23|0:11:42|After speaking, he directly swung his sword towards the person, in the fight, the person tried to remove the ribbon sewn in front of his eyes, after several unsuccessful attempts, he used a long sword to pick open the ribbon, smoothly sheathed the sword back, he looked at the uncovered face of [Bai Qian], his eyes immediately filled with shock, the ribbon-less [Bai Qian].
0:11:42|0:11:51|She covered her eyes in frustration. Beside her, Ali couldn't believe her eyes either, and she rushed over to hug [Bai Qian].
0:13:18|0:13:21|Ye Hua flashed a smug smile and took a step towards [Bai Qian].
0:14:6|0:14:30|[Bai Qian] was so angry with this father and son that she turned to leave the scene. A woman hurried over to [Ye Hua], but when she saw [Bai Qian], she froze in place. Upon hearing these words, the woman quickly avoided [Bai Qian]'s gaze.
0:14:48|0:15:3|After speaking, [Bai Qian] brushed her sleeves and left the Coral Palace. When the banquet was over, she was ready to return to Qingqiu from the bottom of the sea. However, thinking that she had nothing else to do, she detoured halfway to the Ten-Mile Peach Blossom east of the East Sea, planning to ask Zhe Yan, the High God, for two jars of peach blossom wine.
0:15:4|0:15:13|At this time, it is the season when peach blossoms are in full bloom. The Ten-Mile Peach Blossom Forest is filled with colorful flowers from beginning to end, covering the mountains and plains, vibrant like a raging fire.
0:15:13|0:15:32|After Zhe Yan whistled, tens of thousands of hummingbirds fluttered among the peach trees, their wings trembling, causing the trees to rustle. Countless petals fell from the peach trees, drifting down into the stream in the forest, then tumbling into Zhe Yan's wine-making pool from a crevice in the rocks. And thus, peach blossom wine was born.
0:15:57|0:16:0|Bai Qian explained the situation to Zhe Yan in detail.
0:16:23|0:16:48|After Bai Qian swallowed the peach blossom in her mouth, she voiced her inner doubts. Seeing Bai Qian pressing for answers, Zhe Yan stopped his action of tasting wine. Upon hearing this, Bai Qian did not continue questioning and later returned to Qing Qiu.
0:17:35|0:17:44|If you're looking for trouble on purpose, then don't bother beating around the bush. [Ye Hua] heard the goods and stood up, a smile on his face, unable to hide his joy.
0:18:12|0:18:15|[Ye Hua] turned to [Bai Qian] and said.
0:18:40|0:18:50|[Bai Qian] angrily pulled her sleeve and left the room. The next morning, she was sleeping in bed as usual. [Ye Hua] came with A Li to find her.
0:19:5|0:19:10|[Bai Qian] covered herself with the blanket, let out a long sigh, and then left with the two of them.
0:20:23|0:20:39|Mo Yuan was unfortunately smoked all over by the poisonous fire. [Ye Hua] looked at him in a comical state and burst into laughter. Then, he pulled down the vine controlling the water, letting the water flow into a basin filled with vegetables. After washing them clean, he swiftly chopped them up with his excellent knife skills. Ah Li was greatly impressed upon seeing this.
0:20:39|0:20:42|He patted the fish tail with the back of the knife, and the scales all over the body fell off one after another.
0:20:43|0:21:2|Using immortal techniques to burn firewood and boil water, then soaking flour and water in the air at the same time, the dough instantly takes shape. The noodles swing up and down between his hands. On the side, [Bai Qian] watches intently. [Ye Hua] flicks the noodles in his hand towards [Bai Qian], then skillfully pulls them back, before coming to stand in front of [Bai Qian].
0:21:2|0:21:7|Strands of noodles swirled around [Bai Qian] like ribbons. Suddenly, the meat seemed to transform into long whips.
0:21:11|0:21:24|[Ye Hua] skillfully fried and stewed the fish with carrots and other side dishes. In no time, a table full of delicious dishes was ready. [Bai Qian] picked up a bowl of fish soup first and took a spoonful to taste.
0:21:39|0:21:51|After speaking, he paused for a moment, his hand holding the fish soup suspended in the air. After dinner, Migui accompanied Ali to play games in the woods.
0:22:21|0:22:37|Ye Hua repeatedly made requests, Bai Qian immediately put away the just hung up xiangrong, picked up the wine pot. Bai Qian angrily threw the wine pot lid at him, and he just smiled faintly.
0:22:40|0:22:52|[Bai Qian] looked displeased, but [Ye Hua] seemed interested in her expression. As night fell, the bright moon hung high above the horizon. [Bai Qian] prepared to go to sleep.
0:23:18|0:23:28|One lying in front and the other lying behind on the bed, [Bai Qian] tried to sleep as close to the edge of the bed as possible, pulling a corner of the blanket over, covering half of her body.
0:23:37|0:24:4|Feeling [Ye Hua] approaching her, [Bai Qian] uncomfortably shifted towards the edge of the bed. Seeing this, [Ye Hua] got up and directly leaned against [Bai Qian]. The night finally passed, and the next morning, while [Bai Qian] was looking at the words [Ye Hua] had written for her the day before, a voice sounded behind her.
0:24:10|0:24:16|[Bai Qian] took down the wine jug from the high shelf and poured a cup of wine for Ali, when Migui suddenly appeared.
0:24:34|0:24:42|After Ali finished drinking, she passed the wine cup over. Her eyes gradually became unfocused, swaying a few times before falling to the ground with a thud.
0:25:2|0:25:7|[Ye Hua] looked at Ali lying on the bed and asked. [Bai Qian] smiled and replied to him.
0:25:36|0:25:40|Ye Hua released Ali's hand, suppressing his anger, and stood up to look at [Bai Qian].
0:25:51|0:26:7|The two remained silent for a while, but Ali suddenly got up with a smile, then laughed and lay back on the bed. Seeing that Ali was just drunk, [Ye Hua] quickly grabbed her hand, looking at the sleeping Ali, her anxious heart finally relaxed.
0:26:7|0:26:18|[Bai Qian] relaxed as her tense heart finally calmed down. She shook her sleeves and walked out of the room quietly. Then she arrived at the Peach Blossom Forest ten miles away.
0:26:52|0:27:8|Prince Tian Sun, my mother has long forgotten about you. Following Ali's footsteps, [Su Jin] arrived at the Salt Slide Cave in the Maze Valley, where she was stunned to see a man's body attached to an ice coffin.
0:28:2|0:28:8|Upon hearing Bai Qian's words, Su Jin's body froze in place, and the two stood facing each other in a standoff.
0:28:13|0:28:26|Upon seeing [Su Jin], Ah Li quickly hid behind [Bai Qian]'s pavilion.
0:28:26|0:28:34|Upon seeing [Su Jin], Ah Li quickly hid behind [Bai Qian]'s pavilion.
0:28:41|0:28:48|[Susu] was speechless and left Qing Qiu. [Xuan Nv] was crying endlessly facing the abyss.
0:29:0|0:29:4|[Xuan Nv] heard a sound and quickly turned around to see [Susu] walking towards her.
0:29:41|0:29:50|Siyin finished speaking coldly about everything known in the East Sea. Hearing Xuan Nv's question, Siyin smiled and looked at her.
0:30:1|0:30:9|[Ye Hua] brought [Bai Qian] to the Junqi Mountain in the mortal realm. The mountain, named Junqi, is the closest place to the immortal realm in the mortal world.
0:30:14|0:30:25|[Bai Qian] looked around at the surroundings, with the thatched cottages on the mountain surrounded by trees on three sides. [Ye Hua] walked into the house, striking two flints together repeatedly.
0:30:29|0:30:38|After finishing speaking, Ye Hua prepared to start a fire with his immortal powers, but Siyin quickly stopped him.
0:30:46|0:31:3|After [Ye Hua] finished speaking, he coaxed [Siyin] to sleep. With nothing to do, [Bai Qian] wandered around the room. She looked at the decorations in the room and walked up to a table. On the table was an old painting covered in thick dust, [Bai Qian] leaned in to examine it closely.
0:31:3|0:31:14|The woman in the painting has delicate eyebrows and a charming appearance. She breathes out a sigh, blowing away the dust on the painting, and the woman's face in the painting becomes clear. [Bai Qian] couldn't help but feel sorrowful.
0:31:18|0:31:42|[Bai Qian] never took her eyes off the painting. [Ye Hua] watched [Bai Qian] as she examined the painting intently. [Bai Qian] smiled as she looked at the woman in the painting. Seeing her smile, [Ye Hua] felt as if he saw a glimpse of [Susu] in her, and he began to talk to her about the past.
0:32:0|0:32:10|Ye Hua fell into the mortal world and collapsed on Junji Mountain. He was seen by Susu passing by. Susu looked at his picturesque eyebrows and eyes, as if he were asleep, and called out softly.
0:32:51|0:32:59|[Ye Hua] was startled when he heard the news, then stood up and stood directly in front of [Susu], before speaking.
0:33:0|0:33:6|[Susu] didn't expect that the absurd words she casually said were taken seriously by [Ye Hua].
0:33:23|0:33:28|One day, [Susu] was preparing to cook, while [Ye Hua] looked at a piece of wood.
0:33:42|0:33:52|If I could stay by his side here all the time, I would be willing to fall into the mortal world. [Susu] lit the fire in no time.
0:34:19|0:34:33|[Ye Hua] walked and talked. He was telling [Bai Qian] about his past with [Susu]. Suddenly, he stopped under a peach tree in the courtyard, where [Susu] was holding a ball of yarn, slowly knitting clothes.
0:34:43|0:35:3|At that time, during the peak of peach blossom season, [Ye Hua] approached to admire the peach blossoms. He reached out a hand to [Susu], who looked at him with affection in her eyes, then ran towards him and threw herself into his embrace, with a smile on her face that only grew brighter.
0:35:5|0:35:18|After embracing for a long time, the two slowly separated. [Susu] looked at [Ye Hua] in front of her and couldn't help but kiss him. They held hands under the peach tree, gazing affectionately at each other.
0:35:42|0:35:47|Facing the questioning from [Bai Qian], [Ye Hua] lowered his eyes in contemplation, then glanced at the peach tree after a moment.
0:35:50|0:36:5|Ye Hua finished speaking, turned and entered the thatched cottage without saying more, leaving [Bai Qian] alone under the peach tree. As night fell and the sky darkened, countless sky lanterns floated in the air, and A Li lit the lantern in [Bai Qian]'s hand.
0:36:52|0:36:56|After hearing Bai Qian's wish, Ye Hua recalled Susu from three hundred years ago.
0:37:5|0:37:24|In the past, [Susu], just like today's [Bai Qian], held a sky lantern in her hands, closed her eyes, crossed her index fingers in front of her chest, then released the lantern from her hands, watching it slip away from her fingertips, slowly flying towards the sky, merging into a sea of lanterns, the scattered sky lanterns resembling thousands of stars.
0:37:25|0:37:44|The pitch-black night sky was adorned with dazzling stars. The next morning, Ye Hua sat in front of the dressing table facing the bronze mirror, with Bai Qian holding the brush, combing his long hair from behind with the burial book in her hand. As he looked at the characters in the mirror, it seemed as if he had returned to three hundred years ago, when Susu, just like Bai Qian now, stood behind him.
0:37:44|0:37:53|Using the same technique and posture to help him stand up, three hundred years later, today, after [Bai Qian] arrived at Junji Mountain, all of this appeared in his mind one by one.
0:38:3|0:38:11|[Bai Qian] combs through Ye Hua's long hair, gathers it up on top of his head, then puts on a jade crown and uses hairpins to secure the hair.
0:38:17|0:38:22|[Bai Qian] half-bowed her body, watching Ye Hua with his well-styled hair in the bronze mirror, lost in thought.
0:38:22|0:38:41|Upon returning to Qingqiu, [Bai Qian] went straight to the Salt-Hued Cave. She placed one hand on the ice coffin, and immediately, the fairy vines around the coffin climbed up her arm to her chest. In an instant, they ruthlessly pierced into her heart, causing her body to tremble uncontrollably as the vines greedily absorbed her heart's blood.
0:38:42|0:39:0|Transmitting slowly through his own meridians to the sleeping [Mo Yuan] in the hotel. [Bai Qian] looked at [Mo Yuan], recalling seventy thousand years ago, during the war with the Ghost Tribe, [Mo Yuan] swung his long sword from high in the sky, using all his cultivation to seal the Ghost Lord Qin Cang in the ice of the Eastern Yellow River.
0:39:51|0:39:57|[Bai Qian] looked at [Mo Yuan], took a sip of wine and tears welled up in her eyes.
0:40:5|0:40:16|Above the Heavenly Realm, the clouds are swirling, giving a surreal feeling. Gradually, the misty fog dissipates, revealing a distant, looming grand palace.
0:40:16|0:40:31|Ye Hua sat at the desk in the hall, staring absentmindedly at the clean lamp on the table. Even when Su Jin walked up to her table with a teapot and poured tea into her cup, she remained oblivious, just gazing at the lamp for a long time. Su Jin approached and called out softly,
0:40:36|0:40:39|Turned around and left. [Bai Qian] wanted to find out.
0:41:24|0:41:34|Mistaken identity, [Bai Qian] pondered Zhe Yan's words and returned to the Salt Sliding Cave. She saw Mi Gu and asked him in confusion.
0:41:45|0:42:2|Mo Yuan accidentally fell down the stairs, but Bai Qian appeared to be ill and in an instant transformed into Xuan Nv. At this moment, the figure of Qing Cang also appeared at the entrance of the Salt Cave. He looked at Mo Yuan, who had fainted on the ground and was being taken care of by Xuan Nv, snorted coldly, and then led Xuan Nv into the cave.
0:42:2|0:42:8|[Xuan Nv] looked at [Mo Yuan] lying in the hotel, recalling a scene from seventy thousand years ago in the East Sea Palace.
0:42:44|0:42:48|After Xuan Nv left, the real Bai Qian rushed back from the peach blossom forest in the stone, questioning with a puzzled expression.
0:43:45|0:43:55|Zhe Yan transformed into a phoenix and brought [Bai Qian] to the Grand Purple Palace. Zhe Yan quickly dealt with the guards at the gate.
0:44:1|0:44:3|Bai Qian rushed in immediately after hearing.
0:44:9|0:44:16|[Xuan Nv] at this moment, holding chicken wings containing a stillborn fetus, [Bai Qian] had already rushed into the main hall of the Great Ancestral Hall and dealt with a small group of ghost craftsmen.
0:44:43|0:45:0|Thousands of ghosts stood frozen in place, holding long knives and iron swords. Zhe Yan took out a wine flask from his bosom and drank heartily. After a few sips, he held the wine flask up high, and a sword pierced through it, followed by a huge fireball emerging in the sea of flames.
0:45:0|0:45:18|In the hall, [Bai Qian] waved the hand holding the sword lightly, transforming the Kunlun fan into a long sword, then back into a fan shape, but the fan leaves turned into restraints. [Bai Qian] raised the Kunlun fan, swung it forcefully twice, and several ghost soldiers were thrown out. She crossed over the few ghost soldiers and ran straight towards [Xuan Nv].
0:45:18|0:45:29|[Xuan Nv] used her internal force to push out her outer garment, trying to briefly block [Bai Qian]'s line of sight. However, [Bai Qian] quickly dodged the sharp knives behind the outer garment, pressing [Xuan Nv] relentlessly. [Bai Qian] leaped into the air and paused there.
0:45:29|0:45:46|Revealing her nine tails, Bai Qian swiftly landed on the ground, executed a quick turn, and the power of her tails made several surrounding ghost soldiers give up their pursuit. Using one tail, she wrapped up the last ghost soldier, then with another tail, she heavily slapped him in the face, finally throwing him down a deep abyss.
0:45:46|0:46:4|Seeing [Xuan Nv] rushing towards him, he easily flicked [Xuan Nv] away with his tail, but [Xuan Nv] ended up colliding with the ice coffin in the nearby tomb. As he got up, he once again engaged in a fight with [Bai Qian]. Along the way, a ghost soldier emerged, and [Bai Qian] threw him out with her tail, only to unexpectedly collide with the ice coffin in the tomb again.
0:46:4|0:46:18|The ice coffin gradually shifted from its original position after repeated impacts. After several rounds of fighting, [Xuan Nv] was attacked in succession by [Bai Qian]'s nine tails and ended up falling to the ground in a sorry state. It was only then that the two noticed the ice coffin in the tomb and the dead fetus crystal on top of it.
0:46:18|0:46:28|As the ice coffin was about to fall into the endless abyss, [Bai Qian] transformed her tail into a ribbon and forcefully grabbed onto the ice coffin, but the dead fetus crystal on the ice coffin still fell down.
0:46:31|0:46:40|He turned around with his weapon, smashing the ice cone wrapped in silk ribbons. In an instant, the ice coffin broke free from control and continued sliding towards the endless abyss.
0:46:40|0:46:50|When [Xuan Nv] raised her weapon and smashed towards the ice coffin, [Bai Qian] had already quickly protected the ice coffin, striking down that hammer. As the ice coffin continued to slide, a sword was inserted at the edge of the cliff, stopping everything.
0:46:50|0:47:0|[Xuan Nv] was furious and wanted to strike the ice coffin again, but was countered by the arrival of [Ye Hua], falling heavily to the ground. [Bai Qian] on the ice coffin was panting heavily, enduring the pain in her body.
0:47:6|0:47:22|To prevent the devastation of all living beings, Ye Hua arrived in time and successfully saved [Mo Yuan]'s immortal body. Bai Qian once again placed the ice coffin back in the Salt Huadong.
0:48:14|0:48:19|The catastrophe 70,000 years ago is still vivid in the memory of [Bai Qian].
0:48:34|0:48:37|[Bai Qian] reverts to her true form and enters the water to heal her injuries.
0:48:48|0:49:3|Seventy thousand years ago, after [Mo Yuan] sacrificed himself to seal the Eastern Emperor, [Siyin] carried his immortal body to a cave in Qingqiu where spiritual energy converged, known as the Salt Flower Cave, and preserved [Mo Yuan]'s immortal body in an ice coffin. Looking at [Mo Yuan]'s immortal body, he said.
0:49:43|0:49:56|[Ye Hua] grabbed [Bai Qian]'s hand and placed it on his chest. [Bai Qian] looked at [Ye Hua] without responding. [Ye Hua] leaned in towards [Bai Qian], embracing her neck and gradually moving closer to her forehead.
0:50:2|0:50:12|[Bai Qian] felt the force on her slender neck. Unable to control herself, she slightly lifted her head, before she could react, her lips were tightly covered by [Ye Hua]'s scorching lips.
0:50:12|0:50:31|[Bai Qian] was stiff at first, then her body was bound in [Ye Hua]'s arms, and soon completely surrendered to the dense and profound texture of [Ye Hua], her arms unknowingly climbing onto his sharp head. After a period of tenderness, [Bai Qian] followed [Ye Hua] back to the Heavenly Palace, where the Heavenly Emperor issued a decree in the Nine Heavens.
0:50:58|0:51:4|The heavenly soldiers and generals kneel down to pay their respects. [Ye Hua] and [Bai Qian] hold hands as they walk up to the main hall, when suddenly a star deity rushes forward.
0:51:29|0:51:38|Grandma, upon hearing this, stood behind [Bai Qian] with her head lowered. On the side, [Su Jin] glared at Grandma behind [Bai Qian] with eyes full of anger.
0:51:40|0:51:48|[Ye Hua] smiled, indicating his consent. Then, [Ye Hua] led [Bai Qian] to a courtyard.
0:52:29|0:52:41|Upon hearing Ali's words, [Ye Hua] couldn't help but laugh, while [Bai Qian] immediately picked up Ali and left the courtyard. Some time later, a dozen celestial geese arrived with dresses and hair accessories to help [Bai Qian] get dressed up.
0:52:41|0:52:52|Two fairy geese poured the mercury from the pot into a basin in front of [Bai Qian], and the mercury immediately rose, condensing in mid-air into a mirror. After the wedding attire was decided, [Bai Qian] returned to the palace.
0:52:55|0:53:3|Grandma walked up to Bai Qian, who was drinking, and Bai Qian asked in surprise,
0:53:32|0:53:35|[Bai Qian] turned around and saw a fierce tiger.
0:54:5|0:54:11|[Su Jin] turned and walked towards the back, [Bai Qian] glanced at the roaring tiger and followed her footsteps.
0:54:23|0:54:38|She didn't even inform [Ye Hua] about this matter. So no one in the palace knows who [Su Jin] is, they just think she is a new palace maid. [Ye Hua] arranged for [Su Jin] to stay and wait for her to give birth to the child.
0:54:40|0:54:44|[Susu] continued to walk towards the platform of the immortals.
0:55:20|0:55:28|The mortal jumped down, [Bai Qian] followed Susu up the last step, bending down to look into the bottomless abyss.
0:55:40|0:55:49|[Bai Qian] looked serious, standing at the highest point of the Immortal's Platform. It seemed like she really heard [Su Jin]'s voice. She turned around and asked [Su Jin] behind her.
0:55:53|0:56:3|At that time, [Ye Hua] had just been appointed as the Crown Prince. He must have understood that he couldn't give up the position of Crown Prince for a mortal woman.
0:57:0|0:57:10|[Bai Qian] heard this, snorted coldly, and left the Bamboo Immortal Platform with her skirt in hand. With the grand wedding rehearsal approaching, [Bai Qian] dressed in a gorgeous gown, and the celestial geese helped her with her makeup and styling.
0:58:6|0:58:15|Ye Hua did not answer Bai Qian's question. Bai Qian stubbornly looked ahead, glancing sideways as Ye Hua bowed to him in a gesture of respect.
0:58:21|0:58:42|[Bai Qian] stood straight, showing no signs of retreat, and turned to coldly question [Ye Hua]. [Ye Hua] remained silent, a serene smile playing on his lips.
0:58:50|0:58:56|After giving a sarcastic reply to the etiquette official, [Bai Qian] took off her dress and left the scene without looking back.
0:59:16|0:59:24|After returning to the palace, [Ye Hua] sat alone at the desk, frowning as he stared at the suspended broken lamp on the table, motionless.
0:59:32|0:59:41|[Bai Qian] took a few sips of peach blossom wine. Zhe Yan smirked devilishly and then spoke to him.
1:0:25|1:0:42|To clear the name of the deceased, [Bai Qian] had to come to find [Ye Hua]. At this moment, [Ye Hua] was not sitting at the desk, the room was empty. [Bai Qian] approached, looking at the glowing candlestick, couldn't help but reach out her hand. Hearing [Ye Hua]'s voice, she silently withdrew her hand.
1:1:24|1:1:27|Bai Qian walked out in a huff.
1:1:52|1:1:55|After venting her frustration, [Bai Qian] grabbed the front of [Ye Hua]'s clothes.
1:2:32|1:2:37|At this moment, [Ye Hua] placed [Bai Qian]'s hand on her chest.
1:3:27|1:3:39|[Bai Qian] looked at [Ye Hua] in front of her, her eyes filled with incredulity. She quickly took a few steps back, leaving [Ye Hua]'s study, leaving [Ye Hua] alone to shed tears in sorrow. Even when he was with Ali, his mind was elsewhere.
1:4:3|1:4:18|After explaining everything to Ali, [Ye Hua] took the sword from the guard and left the Heavenly Realm under the guard's watchful eyes. Meanwhile, [Bai Qian] was climbing a cliff hundreds of meters high with bare hands, with the deep East Sea behind her.
1:4:18|1:4:34|After climbing up the cliff, [Bai Qian] was greeted with a vast expanse in front of her, with thorns, moss, and dead trees scattered under her feet. Wherever [Bai Qian] went, the vegetation on the ground and the fungi on the dead trees all emitted a faint glow, as she carefully searched for the Godly Grass.
1:4:34|1:4:47|Suddenly, she turned her head and saw a shining fairy grass. After carefully identifying it, she happily squatted down, reached out and grabbed the root of the divine grass, trying to pull it out, but the divine grass remained unmoved.
1:4:48|1:5:0|She exerted force with both hands, turning a few more times, but the Godly Grass remained unmoved. She transformed the Kunlun Fan into a sharp blade and stabbed towards the roots of the Godly Grass. The ground beneath her feet trembled twice before returning to calm.
1:5:0|1:5:12|Following that, [Bai Qian] once again stabbed at the roots of the Godly Grass. After a few consecutive strikes, the entire ground began to shake violently, causing moss and dead wood to be lifted up. [Bai Qian] released the Godly Grass and stood up to maintain her balance.
1:5:13|1:5:28|In a sudden moment, a pair of terrifying eyes emerged from the lifted ground, accompanied by a few roars. [Bai Qian] was already tens of meters above the ground at this point. As she landed on the ground, she saw a Taotie surrounded by withered trees and covered in moss.
1:5:28|1:5:32|The Taotie laughed at the sky, then dragged its heavy body towards [Bai Qian].
1:5:33|1:5:48|[Bai Qian] was agile, with a swift move she dodged the Taotie's big foot effortlessly. After quickly stabilizing herself, without hesitation, she threw the sharp blade in her hand towards the Taotie. The blade fiercely pierced into the Taotie's back, causing it to roar in pain once again.
1:5:48|1:6:3|[Bai Qian] seized the opportunity, stepping on the tail of the Taotie, quickly rushing to her back. The Taotie's body writhed wildly, [Bai Qian] grabbed the blade on her back, trying to obtain the God's Grass again. Suddenly, his body, along with the blade he was holding, was thrown towards the ground.
1:6:3|1:6:16|As [Tao Tie] closed in, [Ye Hua] arrived and shot an arrow straight at his head. Suddenly, [Tao Tie] fell to the ground, and [Ye Hua] swiftly retrieved the arrow before coming to [Bai Qian]'s side. After surviving the ordeal, [Bai Qian] let out a deep breath.
1:6:16|1:6:23|[Ye Hua] reached out a hand towards her, and his originally serious face immediately broke into a smile when [Bai Qian] grabbed hold of it.
1:6:38|1:6:47|The Taotie behind suddenly woke up, catching the two off guard. [Ye Hua] pushed [Bai Qian] away, turning around to block, and in that instant, got bitten on the arm by Taotie.
1:6:47|1:7:4|[Bai Qian] saw the situation and waved a ribbon towards [Tao Tie], using the force to once again fly onto Tao Tie's back. She intended to seize the God Grass during Tao Tie's moment of distraction, but upon seeing [Ye Hua] under Tao Tie's mouth, she still rushed down using the ribbon and forcefully stomped on Ye Hua's sword hilt.
1:7:4|1:7:22|This kick successfully pried open [Tao Tie]'s big mouth, allowing [Ye Hua] to break free. The two of them hung in mid-air by a ribbon. Before the words were finished, [Tao Tie] suddenly changed direction like the wind and water, causing the two to tumble in the air.
1:7:22|1:7:28|During the struggle, the two cooperated with each other, tightly wrapping [Mo Yuan]'s fangs with the ribbons in their hands.
1:7:29|1:7:45|Swiftly circling behind him, [Bai Qian] leaped onto his back from both sides, causing the ribbon to wrap around [Mo Yuan]. After successfully restraining [Mo Yuan]'s hands and feet with the ribbon, she ran forward quickly. Seeing this, [Mo Yuan] also ran forward, but as soon as he took a step, his whole body collapsed to the ground.
1:7:45|1:7:57|[Mo Yuan] tightened the ribbon in his hand, [Bai Qian] leaped and stepped onto the ribbon. With the help of the ribbon's force, [Ye Hua] stepped [Bai Qian] onto [Mo Yuan]'s back. [Bai Qian] aimed at the mysterious grass on [Mo Yuan]'s back and swung her sword towards the roots once again.
1:7:57|1:8:12|Mo Yuan, sensing the danger, swung his tail towards Bai Qian to dodge the arrows. Bai Qian accidentally dropped the arrow in her hand, and Ye Hua fiercely plunged his own arrow into Mo Yuan's front paw. Mo Yuan suddenly lifted his foot, lifting Ye Hua, who was holding the arrow, high into the air.
1:8:12|1:8:20|Ye Hua immediately drew out a long arrow and threw it to [Bai Qian]. After catching the arrow, she decisively stabbed the root of the Godly Grass with the bound arrow, cutting off the power of the Taoti's body.
1:8:24|1:8:35|With a final swing of its tail, the Taotie accurately hit [Ye Hua] in mid-air, causing the unprepared [Ye Hua] to fall to the ground. Following that, the withered branches on the Taotie's body began to fall one after another, and its massive body collapsed in the wind and clouds.
1:8:36|1:8:54|The empty screen smashed onto [Ye Hua], [Bai Qian] saw this and let go of the almost obtained God's Grass. She jumped off the back of the Taotie, risking being hit by flying stones, and ran to [Ye Hua]'s side. She partially transformed back to her true form, using her nine tails to shield [Ye Hua], allowing the falling stones to hit her own body.
1:8:54|1:9:7|Ye Hua, who was in a coma, slowly opened his eyes. He gazed at Bai Qian for a long time, and she looked back at him. The two of them remained silent, while Yingzhou Island was desolate, lifeless, and littered with the remains of the gluttonous creatures.
1:9:7|1:9:23|After returning to the Heavenly Palace, [Ye Hua] sat on the bed in the bedroom, while [Bai Qian] carefully bandaged his arm that was bitten by the Taotie. Shaking his head, [Ye Hua] felt [Bai Qian]'s hand touching his scarred back, his expression turning increasingly serious.
1:9:38|1:9:41|Ye Hua raised his hand and stroked the hair at the temple of [Bai Qian].
1:10:9|1:10:14|Ye Hua pressed his forehead against [Bai Qian]'s, while [Bai Qian] played with the long hair on her face.
1:10:22|1:10:41|[Bai Qian] pressed her nose against hers, hands wrapped around her neck, couldn't help but lean in and kissed her. Ye Hua also held her face, gently kissing her back. Her lips moved from [Bai Qian]'s lips to her hand, then to her chin, nibbling gently, while also removing her lifelong clothing.
1:10:41|1:10:58|Lips moved along her jawline, heading towards her lips, gently cleaning for a while before hand slid down to her lower back, pressing her down onto the bed. After a brief separation, their lips met again, entwining passionately. In the Heavenly Realm, the iron tree that never bloomed, now blossomed with petals.
1:10:58|1:11:15|On this night of ups and downs, when Ye Hua woke up again, Bai Qian was still sleeping soundly in his arms. Ye Hua embraced Bai Qian, his face filled with a happy smile. After Bai Qian woke up, she returned to Qingqiu and went to the Salt Slab Cave, looking at Master Mo Yuan's inn and spoke.
1:12:11|1:12:20|[Bai Qian] finished speaking, a smile appeared on her face. In the Nine Heavens, Prince Ye Hua was reading at his desk, with Concubine [Su Jin] by his side.
1:12:38|1:12:48|Ye Hua said nothing, just staring at the book in his hand, while thinking about Susu's words in his mind. After Bai Qian returned from Qingqiu to Nine Heavens, Ye Hua made a request to her.
1:12:51|1:12:57|[Bai Qian] picked up the comb again, just like on Junji Mountain in the mortal realm, carefully tidying up [Ye Hua]'s hair.
1:13:26|1:13:33|[Ye Hua] turned around, grabbed [Bai Qian]'s hand, and seeing him remain silent, he stood up and continued to speak to him.
1:13:49|1:13:58|[Ye Hua] embraced [Bai Qian], burying his head in her tight grasp. In an instant, he held [Bai Qian]'s hand and couldn't help but tremble uncontrollably.
1:13:58|1:14:7|[Bai Qian] lightly pats his back, and with a sob, a tear falls from [Ye Hua]'s eyes. [Bai Qian] embraces [Ye Hua] with both hands, sinking into his embrace.
1:14:8|1:14:23|[Ye Hua] buried deeper into his well, then let go and avoided [Bai Qian]'s gaze as he walked towards the door. [Bai Qian] kept her eyes on him, but still saw the tears on his face. [Ye Hua] walked further and further away, soon disappearing from [Bai Qian]'s sight.
1:14:23|1:14:41|[Bai Qian] stood still for a moment, then walked to the dressing table. She sat heavily on the chair, gazing at the broken lamp. Soon, the lamp slowly lit up, and within its light, memories that [Bai Qian] had forgotten began to emerge one by one. She saw the beautiful mountains, she and [Ye Hua] embracing, dancing in the peach blossom forest.
1:14:41|1:14:59|Later, [Ye Hua] brought her to the Heavenly Realm, everything before that made her feel very happy. But later on, she could only sit alone in the courtyard day after day, caressing the child in her belly, waiting for [Ye Hua]. On this day, as usual, she sat in the courtyard, and the Fairy Goose Granny, upon seeing her, walked over with a teapot and a cup of water.
1:14:59|1:15:6|[Bai Qian] took the water glass handed to her, just took a sip, when she heard a noise at the door. She looked up and saw [Su Jin].
1:15:35|1:16:3|At this moment, [Su Jin] saw [Ye Hua] rushing over and immediately turned around to jump into the abyss. Seeing this, [Ye Hua] quickly followed suit and jumped down, rescuing [Su Jin] just in time from the depths of Zhu Xiantai. Looking at [Su Jin]'s blinded eyes, [Ye Hua] didn't know what to do.
1:16:16|1:16:19|[Ye Hua] walks up from behind [Su Jin].
1:16:23|1:16:42|Ye Hua, with a solemn face, finished speaking. Susu, who was kneeling on the ground, was stunned. He stared ahead absentmindedly, his eyes not blinking. It wasn't until Ye Hua turned to face him that tears uncontrollably streamed down his cheeks. [Ye Hua] just looked at him sorrowfully.
1:16:42|1:16:49|Recalling this, [Bai Qian] almost collapsed, shouting out in agony. Her head was pounding, memories flooding back in rapid succession.
1:16:57|1:17:3|A dozen celestial soldiers are chasing after [Susu]. After losing her sight, [Susu] accidentally falls to the ground while holding a child.
1:17:6|1:17:14|Grandma handed the bronze mirror that can summon [Ye Hua] to [Susu], urging her to leave quickly. [Susu] accidentally fell again while escaping, and the bronze mirror also fell to the ground.
1:17:17|1:17:24|When she was about to touch the bronze mirror, a tiger's claw pressed down on it. [Susu] recoiled in fear and sat motionless in place.
1:17:28|1:17:39|Susu heard Su Jin's voice and did not resist. Holding the child, she groped forward and walked up to the Zhu Xian Terrace. Su Jin brought a fierce tiger down from the sky, following closely behind.
1:17:49|1:18:10|[Susu] stood still, holding the child, unable to help but gasp. Hearing what [Su Jin] said, [Susu] held the child in her arms tightly.
1:18:14|1:18:19|[Ye Hua] slowly approached [Susu] standing next to Zhongxian Terrace, and [Susu] spoke.
1:18:21|1:18:27|[Ye Hua] embraced [Susu], who was still in shock, taking a half step back.
1:19:33|1:19:40|[Su Jin] pushed [Bai Qian] towards the stage of the immortals. At this moment, [Bai Qian] was just like [Susu], with no difference.
1:19:41|1:19:50|After handing the child to [Ye Hua], [Susu] leaped towards the platform of the immortals. The platform was dangerously unstable, but [Susu], blinded, showed no fear.
1:19:58|1:20:16|The seal of the goose feather appeared, and the ribbon in front of her eyes was taken away by a sharp weapon. [Susu] fainted in mid-air. Before falling asleep, her mind was filled with thoughts about Junji Mountain, with the figure of [Ye Hua] in every scene. However, the strength of the various immortal platforms was too strong, and these memories were all wiped away.
1:20:16|1:20:21|The seal on the goose feather was split open by a sharp weapon, and [Susu] also regained her true form, transforming into a nine-tailed fox.
1:20:57|1:21:15|Su Jin snatched Ye Hua's sword and aimed it towards his eyes. Bai Qian felt the pain as if it were her own, screaming in agony. Ye Hua quickly embraced Bai Qian, who looked at him with even more heartache. She suppressed her emotions, biting her lower lip and pulling on Ye Hua's collar, shaking her body.
1:21:15|1:21:33|The past events branch out, the pain of having her eyes gouged out three hundred years ago feels like it just happened. [Bai Qian] angrily pushes Ye Hua to the ground and leaves the Zhu Xian Terrace alone, filled with sadness. Ye Hua watches [Bai Qian] leave, tears filling his eyes, various emotions flooding his heart.
1:21:33|1:21:46|[Bai Qian] left the Nine Heavens and arrived at Zhe Yan's Peach Blossom Forest. She tilted her head back and drank several mouthfuls of peach blossom wine, swaying back and forth in the forest. She would occasionally smile bitterly, then raise the wine bottle and start drinking again, repeating this cycle.
1:21:46|1:22:5|She walked slowly, never letting go of the peach blossom wine in her hand. The thin mist twirled like sand in the peach forest, spreading throughout the entire peach blossom forest. Clusters of peach blossoms weighed down the branches, as [Bai Qian] looked up at the falling peach blossoms, memories once again overwhelming her. She covered her face, knelt down on the ground, and then lay down.
1:22:5|1:22:7|[Ye Hua] is waiting anxiously outside the peach blossom forest.
1:22:34|1:22:55|Ye Hua insisted on this, Zhe Yan stopped talking and instead went into the peach forest to find Bai Qian. After Bai Qian took a sip of wine and looked up at him, she said. Zhe Yan took her to a spring.
1:23:47|1:24:0|Zhe Yan's words at this moment are exactly the same as what Ye Hua told Bai Qian on Junji Mountain. Ye Hua waits for Bai Qian outside the peach blossom forest day after day, with flowers blooming and falling, seasons changing, and Siyin also facing his deserved judgment.
1:24:46|1:24:59|[Su Jin], who was kneeling on the ground, quickly revealed a sly smile from her bitter expression. In the moment she hugged Ali just now, she had already used a magical tool to secretly suck Ali's blood.
1:24:59|1:25:8|After being exiled to the Eastern Emperor's Palace, [Su Jin] seized the opportunity to climb to the top of the palace when there were no heavenly soldiers guarding the surroundings.
1:25:29|1:25:48|Speak, he directed the fiery rage filled with Ali's blood towards the east room, in an instant, thick smoke billowed, the land near the water's edge began to rumble, the clouds overhead also kept rolling, the surrounding echoes sensed this unusual movement, and stopped to watch one after another, at this moment, in the thick smoke of the east room, he was about to leave.
1:26:11|1:26:29|Unable to wait for [Bai Qian]'s [Ye Hua], tears in her eyes, she forced a smile towards the depths of the peach forest before turning and leaving. Zhe Yan in the peach forest also received a message from a hummingbird at this time. He sighed and said to [Bai Qian]. Upon hearing this, [Bai Qian] immediately turned to look at him.
1:26:41|1:26:55|Bai Qian, who was lying by the spring, stood up and watched Zhe Yan force a smile. As night fell, Zhe Yan transformed into a phoenix and flew towards the Wuwang Sea.
1:27:12|1:27:32|Mi Gu brought [Ah Li] to the peach forest. [Bai Qian] smiled with tears in her eyes, and embraced [Ah Li]. Just as [Bai Qian] managed to hold back her tears, they started flowing again.
1:29:8|1:29:16|From then on, they never saw each other again. They leaped off the Immortal's Platform.
1:29:20|1:29:34|Ye Hua reached out his hand desperately trying to grab [Susu]. Several times, his hand was about to touch [Susu], but failed each time. He watched [Susu] sink deeper and further away, feeling helpless, he could only close his eyes in despair and howl in helplessness.
1:30:4|1:30:17|Grandma revealed everything that [Bai Qian] didn't know, causing her to choke back sobs and eventually burst into tears. Mi Gu was also moved to tears. Meanwhile, near the Eastern Emperor, [Xuan Nv] gathered millions of ghost soldiers.
1:30:31|1:30:49|Thousands of soldiers from the Nine Heavens also dispatched, with Ghost King Qin Cang guarding the gate. From the east, Zhongshang leaped down, the shockwave of the long spear hitting the ground directly sending four or five slaves flying. Ye Hua descended from the sky, wielding his long sword and arrived behind Qin Cang, aiming a direct strike at his head. However, the alert Qin Cang had already seen through it and promptly responded with the correct password.
1:31:1|1:31:18|Upon hearing this, Qing Cang was taken aback and immediately aimed at Yue Hua's armor. Yue Hua, caught off guard, quickly dodged. Qing Cang, however, continued to press on relentlessly, launching attacks one after another, but Yue Hua ascended to the sky. On the other side, Bai Qian, with mixed emotions, fled ten miles east of the East Sea camp and swiftly headed towards the Hopeless Sea.
1:31:18|1:31:25|Ye Hua and Qing Cang are stepping on three intensity levels, fighting fiercely in the air, making it difficult to tell who has the upper hand.
1:31:43|1:31:59|Thousands of ghost soldiers pulled the bowstrings and released arrows into the sky in unison. In the mist, [Ye Hua] saw tens of thousands of arrows coming towards him, swiftly waving the long arrow in his hand to deflect the incoming arrows. Suddenly, an arrow struck his shoulder from behind, knocking down the pigeon feather on one side.
1:31:59|1:32:8|The ghost soldiers launched a second round of attack, shooting tens of thousands of arrows with red lotus moon fire into the air. Many heavenly soldiers were hit and disintegrated directly.
1:32:9|1:32:18|Zhe Yan, who sensed the situation, pushed his palms forward and summoned tens of thousands of hummingbirds to resist the momentum of the ghost tribe, saving the world from being engulfed in smoke and ashes.
1:32:21|1:32:37|After the celestial soldiers roared angrily, they leaped down from the sky one after another, pointing their spears at the ghost soldiers. In a very disadvantageous position, the ghost soldiers panicked at this sight and could only let the celestial soldiers manipulate them. The celestial soldiers reached out with affection, but were restrained.
1:32:37|1:32:54|After lifting up a ghost soldier with a long spear, she flew into the air and finished him off before charging down again. Ye Hua and Qing Cang were still fighting each other, during the battle, Qing Cang hit Ye Hua's left arm with the stick of his long spear axe, and blood instantly flowed down Ye Hua's arm to his wrist.
1:33:5|1:33:13|On the other side, [Bai Qian] did not dare to stop at all, desperately heading towards Wu Wang Hai to fight back, while Qin Cang and [Ye Hua], after a brief negotiation, started a new round of battle.
1:33:13|1:33:30|Ye Hua once again used his previous tactic, flying up into the misty clouds before plummeting down, forcefully kicking Qin Cang in the chest. Zhe Yan's hummingbird also flew in front of the ghost soldiers. Seeing these birds, the soldiers all froze in place, then quickly retreated as another hummingbird flapped its wings.
1:33:30|1:33:46|A loud buzzing sound erupted, and hummingbirds formed a large rectangle in the air, enveloping the ghost soldiers below. Before long, the ground beneath the ghost soldiers cracked open, making it unbearable for them to endure the buzzing sound of the hummingbirds, causing them to cover their ears one after another.
1:33:46|1:33:58|The stones on the ground have slowly been absorbed into the air, and the hummingbirds collectively fly towards the sky. In an instant, the stones stop in mid-air, then suddenly pour down from the sky, heavily hitting the soldiers of the Ghost Tribe.
1:33:58|1:34:14|The ghost soldiers' formation instantly fell apart, while [Bai Qian] continued to fight fiercely in the battle. The intense battle between [Ye Hua] and Qin Sang was ongoing, with [Ye Hua] falling accidentally from the clouds during the repeated clashes, ultimately disappearing into the mist. Suddenly, the figure of [Ye Hua] in the mist transformed into a dragon.
1:34:14|1:34:33|Qing Cang rushed up to the clouds with a roar, a bolt of lightning shot out from his mouth. However, Qing Cang dodged the lightning attack, and Ye Hua, growing stronger, brought his dragon body closer to Qing Cang. He swung his tail heavily towards Qing Cang and then sprayed multiple lightning bolts in succession, attacking the ghost soldiers who had just been hit by giant rocks.
1:34:33|1:34:45|At this moment, facing the attack of lightning, anyone struck by lightning immediately turned into ashes. [Xuan Nv] looked at everything in disbelief, and then a bolt of lightning struck her. After a scream, she turned into ashes.
1:34:45|1:35:0|Countless thunderbolts shot down from the sky, and in no time, the Eastern Emperor's army suffered heavy casualties, with the ghost tribe completely wiped out, tragically dying under the thunderbolts. Ye Fan, who had escaped from close combat, clearly had the advantage in long-range battles, especially with the added attacks of the thunderbolts, making him even more formidable.
1:35:0|1:35:6|After being struck by lightning, the once arrogant Qing Cang's body turned to ashes and fell into the clouds.
1:35:16|1:35:23|At this moment, memories buried deep in the heart for seventy thousand years surged forth.
1:36:3|1:36:25|Seventy thousand years ago, [Bai Qian] watched as the corpse fox [Mo Yuan], holding a cold and gleaming sword, charged towards the scorching East Emperor. At this moment, the leader of [Ye Hua] also held the same sword. [Ye Hua] kept approaching the East Emperor. The actions of [Ye Hua] were exactly like those of [Mo Yuan] back then.
1:36:29|1:36:39|After [Bai Qian] stopped the life and death tribulation, Nirvana proceeded without hesitation and thrust the sword in her hand into the bridal chamber. Instantly, clouds billowed, air currents swirled, and stones rolled.
1:36:52|1:37:10|Upon seeing [Bai Qian] approaching, a tight smile appeared on [Ye Hua]'s face. In that instant, the surging waves in the air solidified into ice, and the hummingbird, not concealed and called back, stiffened after flapping its wings twice, forever frozen on the rock. [Dong Heng] was also trapped under the frozen sea of despair.
1:37:10|1:37:20|The red flames of the night no longer exist, the chaotic and hopeless sea is now silent, as if everything has been frozen in time, leaving only [Ye Hua] trapped beneath the ice.
1:37:21|1:37:26|[Bai Qian] rushed towards the ice where she was, but only touched the cold ice block.
1:37:44|1:37:46|Bai Qian, lying on the ice, sobbed uncontrollably.
1:38:48|1:39:1|[白浅] helplessly called out to [Ye Hua], but he remained motionless, sinking deeper into the Sea of No Return. [Bai Qian] collapsed on the ice in despair and powerlessness, her sobs and cries never ceasing.
1:39:2|1:39:10|In an instant, [Bai Qian] seemed to see [Ye Hua], standing under the peach tree on Junji Mountain, looking at the blooming and withering peach blossoms, smiling.
1:39:14|1:39:25|[Ye Hua] The illusion dissipated, and as time shifted, the withered peach blossoms reappeared on the branches. [Bai Qian] promptly stopped [Ye Hua] from sealing himself with his own life in the Eastern Pavilion.
1:39:25|1:39:43|She did not steal the Chen Zhitao on Yinzhou Island, did not plant it in Qingqiu, and [Ye Hua] did not take her to see the sky lanterns. [Bai Qian] was not imprinted in the Dragon Palace of the East Sea. The plot of this life seems to have not happened, the ribbon has returned to Song Shu on the Zhuxian Terrace, and the hostility did not separate her from the formation seal.
1:40:7|1:40:17|One day, cracks suddenly appeared on the ice that had frozen [Ye Hua], followed by the entire ice surface breaking apart. [Ye Hua] also woke up from it, and the promise of three lifetimes is about to be fulfilled.
1:40:18|1:40:35|Unconsciously, the peach forest of [Zhe Yan] has regained vitality, with peach blossoms blooming all over the ten miles, the peach blossoms on the branches competing to bloom, indulging in full bloom. Under a nearby peach tree stands a familiar figure, everything in front of the eyes feels like a dream, [Bai Qian] unconsciously follows up.
1:40:35|1:40:46|Under the tree, the man remained as handsome and elegant as when they first met, with features like a painting. [Ye Hua] just smiled faintly, extended a hand, and the sound of the zither called out towards [Bai Qian].
