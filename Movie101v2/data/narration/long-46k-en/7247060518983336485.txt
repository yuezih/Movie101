0:1:4|0:1:22|The morning sun shines on the lake, creating shimmering ripples. A swordsman appears above the valley, his fingers lightly gripping the sword handle. Across from him stands a knight, with narrow eyes that seem melancholic, yet the killing intent in his eyes is particularly evident. Both draw their swords at the same time, and the valley is instantly filled with swirling dust.
0:1:22|0:1:31|Their figures moved like wandering dragons, with only the sounds of fighting in their ears but no visible strikes. The speed was extremely fast, and a round ended quickly.
0:1:31|0:1:51|At this moment, the swordsman sheathed his weapon, and the swordsman he was facing, with narrowed eyes, gradually opened them. The red surface at the foot of the mountain was still shimmering with hidden currents, as if nothing had happened. The scene shifted, and the swordsman was seen holding a long sword. Several figures flashed by, and a contemptuous smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.
0:2:7|0:2:24|Seeing the swordsman fighting vigorously, the old man beside him was full of anger. Another wave of assassins rushed forward, attacking while secretly releasing hidden weapons. Despite being surrounded, the swordsman still handled the situation with ease, dodging close-range attacks, blocking hidden weapons with his sword from left to right, and swiftly turning around in the midst of the battle.
0:2:24|0:2:32|The assassins blocking the way suddenly dodged one after another, as a sword sheath swiftly flashed and plunged straight into the assassin's body, nailing him to a nearby wooden stake.
0:2:33|0:2:49|A man tried to sneak attack from behind, but the swordsman raised his sword to block it. Surrounded by numerous enemies attacking from all directions, he remained focused and calm as he swung his sword again. At that moment, the old man suddenly jumped up, tightly gripping his cane and smashing it down towards the ground, causing the scattered wooden sticks to bounce up instantly.
0:2:51|0:3:6|The swordsman clashed swords with the flying deity, his internal energy surged as he struck out with a palm, the wooden stick shot out in the opposite direction, hitting the old man in the lower body. In his pain, the swordsman took advantage of the situation and intentionally stabbed off target. The old man collapsed to the ground, and the swordsman turned and walked away, his desolate figure gradually fading into the distance.
0:3:8|0:3:28|The scene shifts to the desert, where a group of horse bandits wearing straw hats are galloping towards. In the distance stands a mysterious figure on the edge of a sand dune. Soon, the leader of the bandits notices the suspicious person and the whole group comes to a halt. The camera zooms in, revealing the person standing in front to be the [Swordsman] who had previously fought with the swordsman.
0:3:28|0:3:31|The leader lowered his mask and looked at the person blocking the way in confusion.
0:3:32|0:3:48|On the other side, while not knowing what was happening, [Ouyang Feng] had already glared angrily, lifted his long sword, and slashed towards the group. The sword energy roared and shook, like a thunderous sound. In an instant, sand and dust filled the sky, and the entire bandit group fell into chaos.
0:3:48|0:3:58|[Ouyang Feng]'s internal energy surged, stirring up a layer of sand waves, causing some horses to stand unsteadily and fall straight down. The riders on the horses also fell off, but moments later, only [Ouyang Feng] was seen riding away gracefully on horseback.
0:4:16|0:4:25|So many years later, the silhouette of [the hero] grew further and further away, disappearing completely on the horizon.
0:4:34|0:4:37|After [Ouyang Feng] finished speaking, he revealed a meaningful smile.
0:5:48|0:5:55|The scene shifts, and we see [Ouyang Feng] wiping a wine bottle as a figure on horseback appears in the desert.
0:6:1|0:6:4|His name is [Huang Yaoshi].
0:6:13|0:6:21|The night gradually enveloped the sky, [Huang Yaoshi] led his horse to where [Ouyang Feng] lived. He sat at the table and spoke.
0:6:26|0:6:31|He then got up and sat on the other side, picking up a bottle of wine. After drinking it.
0:6:44|0:6:47|Ouyang Feng carefully observes while leaning on the table.
0:7:2|0:7:26|Behind him, [Ouyang Feng] did not answer, looking up at the sky. [Huang Yaoshi] lovingly caressed the bottle mouth. He smiled at the wine in front of him. He glanced at [Ouyang Feng] and raised his hand to tear the wind paper. [Ouyang Feng] picked up the wine and took a sniff.
0:7:29|0:7:32|He put down the wine cup and pondered for a moment.
0:7:36|0:7:44|Since that night, Ouyang Feng had forgotten many things. As he gradually regained consciousness while sitting in the corner, Ouyang Feng looked at him and asked.
0:7:48|0:7:54|[Ouyang Feng] crossed his arms and looked at [Huang Yaoshi] sitting on the ground, furrowing his brow as he continued to ask.
0:8:5|0:8:15|The two fell silent as they looked at the birdcage. That night, Ouyang Feng got drunk again, his whole body sprawled on the table, but one of his hands tightly held onto the accessory placed on the table.
0:8:17|0:8:25|In a simple hut, the flickering candlelight cast a faint glow, and apart from the trembling flames, everything else was as silent as death.
0:8:25|0:8:44|At this moment, a delicate hand suddenly appeared beside [Huang Yaoshi]'s face, gently tidying his scattered hair at the temples. The gentle fingertips lightly traced his cheek, but couldn't help but linger on his firm nose tip, then turned to tidy up the scattered hair around him. This time, the hands did not stop.
0:8:44|0:8:57|Soon, a figure flashed by and decisively left. [Huang Yaoshi], who was lying on the table, quickly opened his eyes and looked up, only to see the figure of a woman.
0:9:13|0:9:24|Standing in front of the door, [Ouyang Feng] lightly touches his cheek, watching [Huang Yaoshi] leave. The scene shifts, with the light shining through the branches reflecting on the mottled banks. One month later,
0:9:29|0:9:32|[Huang Yaoshi] smiled as he watched the woman with her back to him.
0:9:45|0:9:53|The girl's hair was disheveled, dressed in coarse clothes. Upon hearing the movement behind her, tears welled up in her eyes.
0:9:55|0:10:14|After a moment, she tidied the hair piled beside her face and stood up. With her back to the person behind her, she tried hard to control her emotions. Taking a deep breath, the complex emotions still surged up in her heart. She lifted her head, restraining the tears that wanted to fall, and forcefully swallowed the grievances in her heart.
0:10:15|0:10:30|Soon, the woman's emotions calmed down and she turned to look as if nothing had happened. [Huang Yaoshi] was sitting on a horse, silently watching her. The woman stared at him from a distance for a long time, but in just a moment, her gaze turned extremely cold.
0:10:30|0:10:44|She turned around, her eyes fixed firmly on [Ouyang Feng], but she didn't linger long, immediately turning her head and leading the horse forward. She stubbornly pulled on the reins, forcefully tugging the motionless steed, taking big strides in the opposite direction.
0:10:46|0:11:2|In the quiet night, a woman is seen riding on a horse, constantly caressing the horse's neck. Her eyes are unfocused, with a hint of a faint smile. She alternates between placing her legs next to the horse's belly and slowly lifting them up, repeating the motion. The woman buries her delicate face in the horse's mane.
0:11:3|0:11:17|Her mouth slightly open, her eyes gazing at the horse with affection, her slender legs graceful and smooth, the moonlight shining on her, making her look particularly graceful and charming, as if one is placed in a beautiful painting.
0:11:17|0:11:29|After a while, the woman's tense body suddenly relaxed, one hand weakly hanging down to the side, and her calf slowly lowered. But after a while, she lifted her leg again, pressing tightly against the horse's belly.
0:11:30|0:11:51|At this moment, his body is tense, with his calves slightly bent, muscles slightly bulging, hands circling and caressing the sturdy body of the horse. After a moment, he raises his hand to tuck the stray hair behind his ear, revealing his face, breathing heavily. Then he buries his head deeply in the horse's neck, crossing his hands forward to embrace the horse's neck.
0:11:55|0:12:14|[Huang Yaoshi] stopped pouring the wine, only to see the person opposite him picking up the water pitcher and pouring it into his own bowl. [Huang Yaoshi], who had lost the wine, moved the bottle away and quietly watched as more and more water was poured into the other person's bowl. After the person put down the pitcher, he immediately picked up the bowl filled with water and drank it all in one gulp.
0:12:14|0:12:21|[Huang Yaoshi] looked at the extraordinary warrior in front of him and said. The warrior gazed ahead coldly and responded.
0:12:24|0:12:38|After speaking, he quietly looked at [Huang Yaoshi] sitting across from him, with no expression on his face.
0:12:54|0:13:6|The warrior lowered his head to chew on the side dish, without making a response. He frowned and asked [Huang Yaoshi], but seeing no reply from the other party, the warrior answered himself, then lifted the bowl and drank it all in one go. After that, he raised his sleeve to wipe the water stains from the corner of his mouth, then took his dagger and left.
0:13:42|0:13:48|A drinker slammed the table and stood up, only to see the person sitting across from him immediately overturn the table.
0:13:51|0:14:7|Miss Murong Yan, how dare you offend me like this. Miss Murong Yan's sword was already half drawn, but suddenly pushed back into the scabbard. Huang Yaoshi gently held her hand and persuaded her.
0:14:10|0:14:27|The opponent looked coldly at [Ouyang Feng] as he stopped his movements. Seeing this, [Ouyang Feng] slowly withdrew his hand, but Miss [Murong Yan] quickly drew her dagger and swung it fiercely. The sudden commotion frightened the wild cat in the shop, causing it to scream loudly. [Ouyang Feng] weakly leaned against a pillar, his hands covered in blood.
0:14:27|0:14:33|He squinted at the other person, intending to escape quickly, but his body uncontrollably fell backwards.
0:14:34|0:14:53|At this moment, Miss [Murong Yan] still maintained her sword-wielding posture without moving. [Ouyang Feng], who was injured, had sweat beading on his face as he looked down at the bleeding wound on his abdomen. She extended her fingers, now covered in blood, to inspect it repeatedly, revealing a bitter smile. As if resigning herself, she slowly leaned her head against the pillar.
0:15:11|0:15:23|In the scene, Miss [Murong Yan] reveals a satisfied smile.
0:15:58|0:16:13|The other party shook his head uncontrollably upon hearing it, but his expression immediately turned sinister in an instant. After the two talked, [Ouyang Feng] learned the ins and outs of the matter.
0:16:35|0:16:50|The scene goes back to the night when [Huang Yaoshi] and [Murong Yan] were drinking and chatting. Both were intoxicated, and [Murong Yan], feeling a bit shy, looked at [Huang Yaoshi] intentionally or unintentionally. She pretended to be calm as she raised her hand to drink another bowl, looking at the other person with a touch of arrogance.
0:16:50|0:16:54|[Huang Yaoshi] also lifted the wine cup upon seeing this, staring at the other's face and drinking it all in one gulp.
0:16:56|0:17:10|With the possible catalysis of alcohol, in the eyes of [Ouyang Feng], [Murong Yan]'s face became even more beautiful, causing him to couldn't help but stare at her. Finally, [Ouyang Feng] couldn't resist reaching out to touch her cheek, her eyes gentle as water.
0:17:16|0:17:27|After speaking, [Huang Yaoshi] withdrew his hand. [Murong Yan] turned her face away without looking at him. Unintentionally, [Murong Yan] knocked a chopstick off the table. She bent down to pick it up, her expression becoming awkward.
0:17:43|0:17:45|Later, the two of them set a date.
0:17:49|0:18:6|On the day of the appointment, the woman who looks exactly like [Murong Yan] waited for a long time, but there was no sign of [Huang Yaoshi]. He anxiously looked around, only to hear the sound of the wind blowing by his side. The hope in his heart quickly turned into disappointment, followed by a surge of anger.
0:18:8|0:18:21|The disheartened woman stumbled towards the tree. She leaned her whole body against the trunk, furrowing her brow and shedding silent tears, her stubborn pride shattered in this moment.
0:18:31|0:18:49|The woman shouted out the pain suppressed in her heart, but inside it felt like a knife stabbing. She tightly closed her eyes, clenched her teeth, and her delicate face was momentarily clouded with sorrow. The endless desert in front of her, countless folds of sand and stones surging, extending all the way to the distant horizon.
0:20:1|0:20:9|The woman left after bursts of laughter, leaving [Ouyang Feng] puzzled as he watched her back. The next day, [Murong Yan] arranged to meet with [Ouyang Feng].
0:20:28|0:20:37|Immediately, he turned his head and looked towards [Murong Yan]. After a moment of contemplation, her eyes suddenly became sharp.
0:20:51|0:21:12|At dusk, a figure quietly appeared at the home of [Ouyang Feng], and the visitor was none other than the sister of [Murong Yan]. She carried a birdcage in her hand, slowly walking through the dim corridor. Just as she was about to enter, a hint of vigilance flashed in her eyes. Soon, the woman no longer hesitated and walked in, with her back to [Ouyang Feng].
0:21:12|0:21:15|The woven birdcage spins in front of the woman, its reflection shining on her face.
0:21:19|0:21:27|[Ouyang Feng] looked at the woman's back and stirred the food in his mouth. He approached as he spoke.
0:21:36|0:21:41|After speaking, he walked to the table on the side and picked up a cup, pouring some water onto his hand.
0:22:54|0:23:18|The woman remained silent, walking slowly to the side of the birdcage and sitting down. [Ouyang Feng] turned to look at her. As night fell, the woman took the birdcage and left. But soon after, a birdcage appeared at [Ouyang Feng]'s door. He walked out to inspect it carefully, then turned to look behind him. The woman upstairs immediately hid back inside the room.
0:23:20|0:23:38|The woman turned her back tightly against the wall, her body trembling uncontrollably. She occasionally looked back towards the door, then quickly turned her head away. Her hands clung tightly to the wall, her body desperately shrinking inward. At this moment, [Ouyang Feng] slowly approached, standing behind her.
0:23:45|0:23:49|The woman, in an emotional outburst, then turned and threw herself into [Ouyang Feng]'s arms.
0:23:57|0:24:6|A few days after giving her some wine, [Murong Yan] came to see [Ouyang Feng] and started questioning him as soon as she sat down.
0:24:44|0:24:52|Murong Yan's eyes flickered with a cold light. Ouyang Feng walked up to the birdcage. Ouyang Feng asked. He didn't rush to answer, but quietly walked to the other side of the birdcage, bowed his head in thought, and then spoke.
0:25:12|0:25:15|After saying that, he lowered his head as if nothing had happened.
0:25:28|0:25:31|There is a wounded person hiding.
0:25:35|0:25:46|[Ouyang Feng] saw [Murong Yan] throw the wine cup and look up at the night sky. After speaking, she turned her head to the side. Dressed in men's clothing, [Murong Yan] was half drunk and half awake. After pondering for a while, she turned to look at the person she was talking to, only seeing a blurry silhouette in the night.
0:26:18|0:26:21|Murong Yan speaks while touching her own neck.
0:26:44|0:26:55|After burying her head in her arms, she waited for the other person to respond. The words spoken after being drunk, when heard by [Murong Yan], made her lift her head, with moonlight shining on her face.
0:27:15|0:27:21|She lowered her head in pain, tears swirling in her eyes.
0:27:23|0:27:31|[Murong Yan]'s narrow phoenix eyes were suddenly filled with jealousy, as if a fiery killing intent was emanating from her.
0:27:42|0:28:3|After speaking, a hint of a pleased smile appeared on her face. She then gently raised her hand to touch her face. Looking at the moonlight outside the window, she closed her eyes gently and began to speak slowly. At that moment, [Murong Yan] suddenly turned around.
0:28:13|0:28:26|After speaking, she couldn't help but get angry, turned around and tightly covered her mouth by the window. [Ouyang Feng], standing in the dark, looked at her quietly. That night seemed particularly long.
0:28:36|0:29:5|Time passed in the blink of an eye, and the dark sky gradually returned to brightness. [Murong Yan] leaned against the wall, looking ahead with empty eyes. [Ouyang Feng] approached, but [Murong Yan] showed no response. It was only then that she reacted. [Ouyang Feng] looked at the person in front of him, with a haggard appearance, and after a moment of contemplation, he replied.
0:29:17|0:29:33|The night gradually envelops the earth, a suspicious figure suddenly appears, quietly sneaking along the wall into the room. The moonlight outside the window shines into the room, casting his shadow flickeringly. [Ouyang Feng], who had already gone to bed, is lying on his side sleeping soundly.
0:29:38|0:29:55|The delicate profile paused in the moonlight belongs to [Murong Yan]. The deeply sleeping [Ouyang Feng] has his eyes slightly closed, breathing lightly. At this moment, a slender hand slowly approaches her cheek, only to see [Murong Yan] sitting behind her, gazing affectionately at the reclining [Ouyang Feng].
0:29:56|0:30:9|At this moment, whether he is [Murong Yan] or [Murong Yan], he has already deeply fallen into this unattainable love. He greedily caresses [Ouyang Feng]'s cheek, then slides gently down his neck to his arm.
0:30:9|0:30:16|His hand quickly slid more wantonly towards [Ouyang Feng]'s thigh, but his eyes were fixed on his profile.
0:30:17|0:30:31|[Ouyang Feng] kept his eyes tightly shut, seemingly unaware. [Murong Yan]'s fingers were as soft as willow branches, wandering around [Ouyang Feng]'s thigh, with the shadows of the moving fingers reflected on the wall.
0:30:31|0:30:41|The scene shifts, [Ouyang Feng] has opened his eyes, and at this moment, that hand slowly pushes aside his clothes, slipping into his chest, but he closes his eyes again.
0:30:42|0:31:1|At this moment, the person behind him also underwent a change along with his heart, and that person was not [Murong Yan], but another beautiful woman. Her enchanting hand glided across [Ouyang Feng]'s waist, the movements becoming more unrestrained, but her eyes were fixed on him. [Murong Yan]'s hand slowly moved up his chest.
0:31:17|0:31:33|In her eyes, the person lying in front of her is not [Ouyang Feng], but [Huang Yaoshi]. She gently touches the sharp contours of the face in her memory, tidying the scattered hair on both sides. Day after day, [Murong Yan] comes to [Ouyang Feng]'s residence every night.
0:31:33|0:31:43|She either tied up her hair or let it fall loosely on her back. Inconveniently, she lay beside [Ouyang Feng] as usual, continuously caressing his sturdy chest.
0:31:45|0:32:8|At the depth of his emotions, he couldn't help but fall into this beautiful fantasy. Clad in a long robe, his hair cascading down, he leaned against the wall, his cheeks showing a hint of charm. Then, he walked to a withered tree outside the door, leaning his whole body against the trunk, gently swaying and responding to the uncontrollable desire in his heart.
0:32:8|0:32:12|His hands tightly gripped the branches on both sides, occasionally making a sound.
0:32:29|0:32:43|The wind rustled through the leaves. That day, several years later, a strange swordsman appeared in the martial world, and no one knew his origins.
0:32:46|0:33:7|He has a very special name, called [Ouyang Feng]. Later, [Murong Yan] took the alias Dugu Qiu Bai and became a famous swordsman in the martial arts world. She practiced swordsmanship by the lake all day long, dressed in a white dress or a long robe with her hair tied up. The steel sword danced in her hands, stirring up majestic sword energy and creating waves of splendor.
0:33:7|0:33:18|Dozens of meters high waves cascaded down like a waterfall, with [Murong Yan] holding a sword in her left hand pointing straight ahead. Her eyes were cold, like a glacier for thousands of years, making people hesitate.
0:33:19|0:33:36|The figure moved as lightly as [Tao Hua], graceful and elegant in the flowing movements, exuding a heroic and gallant demeanor. With a set of swordsmanship already perfected, he stood in place with a posture of sheathing his sword, then couldn't help but shout out loud.
0:33:36|0:33:45|The misty lake water gently swayed, like a piece of dancing silk in the wind. The sky was reflected in the lake, making it hard to distinguish between heaven and earth.
0:33:47|0:34:2|The rolling mountains, embedded in the sky, [Murong Yan] walks on the opposite side of the lake, only able to see his silhouette, but not his face. As the dawn slowly unfolds, a woman stands with her back to [Ouyang Feng]'s door.
0:34:3|0:34:5|The woman looked melancholic, raising her head slightly.
0:34:10|0:34:13|The woman furrowed her brow and said slowly.
0:34:25|0:34:32|[Ouyang Feng] walked towards the woman after listening. After speaking, he crossed his hands in front of his chest and looked at the woman.
0:34:38|0:34:48|[Ouyang Feng] nodded slightly and continued to ask. The woman lowered her head even further, holding a basket of eggs in her hands. [Ouyang Feng] stood still, silently watching the woman. He looked her up and down, shook his head, and let out a long sigh. With a furrowed brow, he tried to persuade the woman. [Ouyang Feng] looked serious.
0:35:17|0:35:21|The woman adjusted her long hair to cover her cheeks. After speaking, [Ouyang Feng] stared at her intently. The woman tilted her head slightly in response.
0:35:50|0:35:58|At dusk, a woman's figure appeared on the hilltop. She gazed at [Ouyang Feng]'s residence for a long time, then turned and led the donkey away.
0:36:12|0:36:16|In the early hours of the next day, [Ouyang Feng] stood high up watching the woman.
0:36:19|0:36:38|The scene shifts, and [Ouyang Feng]'s elder sister-in-law is seen in front of the mirror, combing her hair. Her complexion is crystal clear, with a delicate and ethereal beauty. Her eyebrows are like ink paintings, exuding a soft and delicate charm. She raises her slender jade hand, adjusting the embroidered hairpin on the side, but the smile on her face gradually fades, replaced by a hint of melancholy in her eyes.
0:36:38|0:36:48|The room was empty, with only her sitting on the blanket, gazing at her reflection in the mirror. The sudden melancholy, with an unknown prelude, arrived at her new home.
0:37:2|0:37:17|In his dream, [Ouyang Feng] seemed to be back at White Camel Mountain, the familiar lake clear as crystal, still as a mirror merging with the sky. But in an instant, the person accompanying him rode away, leaving [Ouyang Feng] alone by the lake.
0:37:18|0:37:27|At that moment, he woke up, opened his eyes and looked outside the door. An endless desert came into view, with rolling hills in the distance.
0:37:27|0:37:43|At this moment, a pair of bright eyes appeared in the frame. Under the sunlight, he slowly closed his eyes. At that moment, the sun quietly hid behind the clouds, and the earth momentarily darkened. [Ouyang Feng] walked out from the house, cautiously looking at the stranger in front of him.
0:37:45|0:37:51|The man slowly opened his eyes, [Ouyang Feng] glanced at the corpses, and asked. The man opened his cracked lips, then he turned around and asked.
0:38:18|0:38:23|[Ouyang Feng] wipes his hands with a book of poetry and classics. Several months ago.
0:38:38|0:38:48|Not far away, the woman crouched by the road waiting, the man with his back to Ouyang Feng. The duel between the man and the Blind Swordsman quickly began, with him standing in place with his head down.
0:39:6|0:39:25|The quick-handed man gripped the knife in his hand without any hesitation. On the nearby mountain peak, a figure sat quietly, observing the two. That person was [Ouyang Feng]. The man raised his head, his gaze piercing, staring fixedly at the setting sun, but the intense rays made him unable to help but close his eyes.
0:39:25|0:39:31|The quick-handed man rushed towards the man, at a critical moment, the man moved swiftly, dodging the long knife and striking back with all his might.
0:39:42|0:40:1|As soon as the words fell, the quick knife hand fell straight down. In the evening, a breeze blew in, causing the window curtains to flutter up and down. The man led the horse back to [Ouyang Feng]'s residence. As if he hadn't heard anything, he passed by the woman, then walked on by himself.
0:40:11|0:40:25|When the sun went down, the man was chewing his food, but his eyes were fixed on the outside. The woman sat on the ground leaning against a wooden stake, with a donkey standing behind her and a basket of eggs beside her.
0:40:25|0:40:39|Not long after, the woman stood up again and took a few steps. She looked up at the sun above her head, opened the handkerchief in her hand, and covered her face. Somehow, the man was already standing outside the door, staring at the woman. [Ouyang Feng] was puzzled, the man's lips were pale, and he took a deep breath.
0:40:48|0:41:12|Seeing the man not responding, [Ouyang Feng] walked up to him, hands resting on the wooden fence. At this moment, the woman [Huang Yaoshi] had once sought appeared in the scene. After the man finished speaking, [Ouyang Feng] did not respond further, and the two remained silent for a long time. [Ouyang Feng] pondered for a moment before answering before leaving.
0:41:14|0:41:16|Finally, the man lifted his gaze towards the distance.
0:41:23|0:41:41|During the day and night alternated, days passed by. The man sat on the steps in front of the door all day, sometimes looking up at the setting sun, but soon lowered his head to stare into the distance. After a few more days, the bandits still did not come, and the man went to the distant hilltop to wait in silence.
0:41:53|0:41:59|His desolate figure sat at the peak of the mountain, inserting the long sword he carried with him into the soil.
0:42:5|0:42:23|In the room, the man held a torch and slowly extended it next to the wick. After a while, the wick was lit, his face illuminated by the candlelight, but his eyes remained tightly closed. Outside the door, the woman still sat on the ground, with a donkey poking its head around her from behind, the desert night wind feeling a bit chilly.
0:42:24|0:42:34|The woman tightly hugged herself with both hands, burying her head deeply in the crook of her arm. There was no emotion on her face, only a strong sense of weariness.
0:42:38|0:42:53|Upon hearing the question, the man lowered his head and fell silent. The mention of hometown seemed to trigger something in him. His hands trembled slightly as he wiped the sweat from his mouth, leaning back against the wall.
0:43:11|0:43:30|After the woman holding the egg asked this question, she stared at him intently, waiting for his answer. After a while, the woman turned and left the room, walking slowly towards the door. Her steps were unsteady, tears faintly visible on her face. Perhaps, she herself had not expected the man to reject her. The woman's pride shattered at that moment.
0:43:30|0:43:36|She frowned, gripping the pillar tightly. [Ouyang Feng] was drinking in the courtyard, a bowl placed in front of him.
0:43:38|0:43:50|She ate what was in her mouth, looked up, then picked up the wine vessel on the table and poured it into the bowl. The man watched quietly as the wine slowly poured out, then picked up the bowl and drank it all in one gulp.
0:43:52|0:43:57|The man casually placed the wine cup on the table, rolled up his sleeves, and wiped his mouth.
0:43:59|0:44:9|Her face showed a sense of determination, [Ouyang Feng] looked straight at her, then quickly shifted his gaze elsewhere. The man stood still upon hearing this, and replied.
0:44:43|0:45:1|[Ouyang Feng] stared at him with wide eyes, but the man left without looking back. An hour later, the man prepared to leave with his horse. As he passed a crossroads, he paused in front of a woman selling eggs, but quickly turned away. After a few steps, he stopped again, bowing his head in deep thought.
0:45:2|0:45:20|The woman behind held a basket of eggs and stood still. At this moment, the man suddenly turned around, inserted the sword into the sand, hugged the woman tightly, and stabilized. The woman's face was full of resistance, using all her strength to push the man away. The man then immediately turned around, put away the long sword, and left.
0:45:20|0:45:29|The woman watched his back in anger, squatted down, grabbed a handful of sand and threw it over, then walked back and leaned against a wooden stake. At this moment, the man frowned.
0:45:38|0:45:50|The woman who was forcibly kissed broke down emotionally, squatting on the ground holding her head and crying. Most of the eggs in the basket beside her had been smashed. She cried as she picked up the broken eggs one by one and put them back in the basket.
0:45:55|0:46:2|The man was thinking about the woman in his hometown, but little did he know that at this moment, the woman in his hometown was tightly holding onto his clothes.
0:46:2|0:46:21|He walked forward expressionlessly, his eyes filled with determination. There were tiny beads of sweat on his face, and his eyes appeared even deeper in the dimly lit corridor. The battle against the bandits was not only a fierce fight, but also a bold gamble with fate for him. No one knew if he would ever see the [Tao Hua] of his hometown again after this walk.
0:46:23|0:46:25|A pair of horse thieves are galloping towards us, changing horses along the way.
0:46:54|0:47:11|Not far away, a man is sitting in an abandoned wooden house, waiting. He closes his eyes, waiting for a storm to come. The woman who sells eggs is still standing at the intersection near [Ouyang Feng]'s residence, but this time, she doesn't have any eggs in her hands, only the remaining donkey standing beside her.
0:47:11|0:47:17|She squatted helplessly on the ground, grabbed a handful of sand and threw it out as if still in a state of anger.
0:47:18|0:47:34|On the other side, the man picked up a jar of wine on the table and drank it all, wiping his mouth with his sleeve. The band of horse bandits with straw hats watched him quietly, their eyes extremely fierce. In that moment, the bandits wielding big knives rushed towards him in a frenzy.
0:47:38|0:47:58|At that moment, flames burst out and ignited the clothes of the person in the front. He quickly drew his sword and engaged in a fierce fight with the oncoming horse bandits. After a few moves, the bandits suffered numerous casualties, while the man remained unscathed. Seeing this, the others did not dare to rush forward to their deaths, only holding their knives and glaring at the man with caution.
0:47:58|0:48:4|The seemingly harmonious scene did not last long, and the two sides started fighting again. At this moment, another group of people and horses arrived outside.
0:48:6|0:48:15|More and more opponents appeared, the man swung his sword left and right to remove the obstacles in front of him, and then leaped through the thatched roof to stand on the earthen wall.
0:48:15|0:48:26|At this moment, the woman was still standing at the intersection, leaning on a wooden stake on the side. She was wiping the sweat off her neck with a handkerchief, then fully unfolding it, neatly folding it up again. The donkey behind her occasionally flicked its ears.
0:48:30|0:48:49|The sky, originally bathed in the bright moonlight, was suddenly covered by dark clouds. The man looked up, then turned his gaze to the densely packed bandits surrounding him. Each of them held a menacing knife. Frowning, the man raised his long sword high and advanced step by step towards the opponents in front of him. However, the people behind him also slowly closed in with his every step.
0:48:49|0:48:54|The man's sharp eyes were filled with killing intent as he observed the movements of the people around him.
0:48:58|0:49:17|A furious shout broke through the battlefield, the man's sword swinging faster, with the sound of wails constantly ringing in his ears. The massive bandits kept coming in waves like vicious dogs, pouncing on the lone man. He wielded his sword in front and behind to fend off the attacks, seizing the opportunity to strike accurately when the opponents were off guard.
0:49:17|0:49:33|The injured bandit on the ground stirred up the dust, emitting a painful roar. At this moment, the man continued to wield his sword methodically, the sky gradually darkening. Some fearless desperados in the bandit group approached once again.
0:49:33|0:49:42|The brave and skilled man is determined to confront him, but at this moment, another wave of enemies is attacking. They are riding horses quickly towards the man's location.
0:49:45|0:50:1|But as the man dealt with the opponents in front of him, a group of people and horses had already stood on the hillside a hundred meters away from him. At this moment, another round of shouting came from behind. He turned around to look, only to see another group of people running down the hill from behind, holding big knives.
0:50:12|0:50:34|The man ran forward quickly, ready to face the enemy head-on. Before the frontmost horse thief could even clean himself up, he was already killed by the man's sword. Others rushed forward, with sword shadows leaping and blades clashing. The piercing sound of metal collisions echoed continuously. Most of the horse thieves were no match for the man, leaving behind only a painful scream before meeting their demise.
0:50:34|0:50:39|As the men were killing with great gusto, a figure on horseback was slowly approaching.
0:50:40|0:50:53|The man sensed danger and turned around, only to see a figure descending from the sky and striking heavily on his neck. In the woods of his hometown, the birds scattered rapidly like evil spirits fleeing.
0:51:5|0:51:25|The man who suffered a fatal blow silently lowered his head, and this difficult duel ultimately ended in failure. At the moment when the blade cut his neck, he seemed to see the woman from his hometown that he had always missed. And on this day, [Huang Yaoshi] was still waiting for the man to return at [Ouyang Feng]'s residence.
0:51:25|0:51:28|He sat on the stool and took a sip from the wine bowl on the table.
0:51:49|0:52:2|Two days later, a showdown took place at the lake. The person on the horse was unexpectedly attacked by the hidden Barefooted Hero in the water. Seeing the Barefooted Hero reveal his true identity, his companion immediately rushed forward and swung the knife down.
0:52:3|0:52:22|The barefoot hero somersaulted and kicked the man away. The last member of the group rode a fast horse to rush over. His moves were fierce and swift, while the barefoot hero countered each move and found the opportunity to stab at his abdomen. The opponent let out a painful cry, staring at him with wide eyes.
0:53:48|0:54:6|Sitting in the corner, [Tao Hua] chewed on the food in her mouth and looked towards [Ouyang Feng]. The scene shifted, a group of people and horses were marching orderly towards the depths of the desert. They were all wearing helmets and riding horses, the sound of metal clashing constantly coming from their bodies, giving off a particularly imposing aura. [Murong Yan] arrived shortly after.
0:54:18|0:54:26|Sitting among a group of swordsmen, the man in red lacquer kept adjusting his shoes. [Ouyang Feng] held an umbrella, sitting in front of the villagers.
0:54:29|0:54:33|Wiping the sweat flowing down his chest with a handkerchief.
0:54:41|0:54:44|After speaking, he looked arrogantly at the villagers.
0:54:49|0:55:9|Seeing no one responding across, [Ouyang Feng] sighed helplessly. Then, he raised his hand to wipe the sweat on both sides of his cheeks. [Ouyang Feng] stood still, watching the reactions of the people around him.
0:55:23|0:55:26|He cunningly looked at the villagers standing up.
0:55:34|0:55:42|A few days ago, he ambushed bandits here. Little did he know that he would be the one to die.
0:56:1|0:56:13|[Ouyang Feng] took off his dust mask and said solemnly, "Pay attention to someone." After that, he turned around and left.
0:56:35|0:56:53|At noon, the desert exuded a hint of heat, with a faint and lingering heat wave in the air. At this moment, the silhouette of the horse thieves appeared on the sand dunes, holding the red flag that had been waiting for a long time, quietly observing the movements of this group of people. Just as the horse thieves were about to approach, a sudden gust of wind swept through the desert.
0:56:53|0:57:1|The sandstorm filled the air, obscuring everything around. The horse thieves riding on horseback were also forced to retreat repeatedly by the sudden sandstorm.
0:57:2|0:57:21|They had to dismount and lead the horses by the reins, struggling to move forward. The horses were being blown to the side by the wind, but the horse thieves quickly caught up and pulled them back, continuing to move towards the strongest headwind. Seeing the horse thieves in disarray, [Hong Qi] seized the opportunity, drew his sword, and quickly charged towards the group.
0:57:21|0:57:40|Unexpectedly, the bandit's reaction was also extremely quick, immediately raising his sword to block the attack. However, [Hong Qi]'s strength was immense, and he quickly dealt with him in just a few moves, even killing a few accomplices who tried to help. At this moment, other bandit accomplices rushed over one after another, and [Hong Qi] swiftly cut through the chaos, killing one after another.
0:57:40|0:57:47|He keeps his eyes on all directions, ears open to all sounds, able to handle any situation whether it's a head-on confrontation or a surprise attack from behind with ease.
0:57:48|0:58:6|At this moment, a masked man drew his sword with his left hand ready to attack. [Hong Qi] quickly stepped in front of him, picked up a long sword and swung it upwards. Accompanied by a painful scream, a bloody arm flew into the sky. The other bandits were furious, mounted their horses, brandished their swords, and charged towards [Hong Qi], plunging the scene into chaos once again.
0:58:7|0:58:22|Even the frightened horses were planning to escape in groups. By killing the horse thief who wielded the knife with his left hand, [Hong Qi] greatly increased his chances of winning. In just a few hours, he had eliminated all the remaining horse thieves, and the horses on the sand dunes were released, still running forward with all their might.
0:58:23|0:58:41|From a distance, [Ouyang Feng] watched everything with a smile on his face, then quickly put on his mask and silently left. Looking around, the desert was littered with the bodies of bandits, their clothes covered in sand and some even half buried by the sandstorm, yet the bloodstains on them were still very prominent.
0:58:41|0:58:46|Under the dark sky, a thick smoke gathered and drifted towards the distance.
0:58:59|0:59:5|[Murong Yan] lies on a hammock, carefully counting the money in her hand, then tucks it into her waist, remembering it firmly.
0:59:28|0:59:40|He turned silently and looked at the distant desert. [Ouyang Feng] paused for a moment, strolled over, and stood in front of him. He looked up and down at the stubborn woman in front of him, leaning forward.
0:59:42|0:59:51|The woman stubbornly turned her head to look into the distance, and from that day on, she would come to the vicinity every day to wait, always paying attention to the movements of the camel at the door.
1:0:3|1:0:16|The woman looked at the camel with a sense of grievance, her mouth involuntarily turning downwards. Her once beautiful face was now dirty from the sand. The next day, [Ouyang Feng] stood at the door observing the commotion below.
1:0:24|1:0:33|The woman lowered her head and didn't look at him. Seeing that he still didn't move, [Murong Yan] stepped forward and pushed him, the woman turned her head defiantly and shouted.
1:0:40|1:0:58|The woman, feeling helpless, had to turn around and walk forward step by step. [Hong Qi] stood still, watching the woman's back. Seeing that she didn't look back, he didn't urge her further. The camel beside them turned its head, looked at the two of them, and then nonchalantly resumed chewing on the licorice in its mouth.
1:0:58|1:1:2|A few days later, [Ouyang Feng] found the woman who had been driven away by [Hong Qi] again.
1:1:13|1:1:24|Who says it can't be done? After [Ouyang Feng] said that, he gave a bitter smile, crossed his arms in front of his chest, as if recalling something.
1:1:31|1:1:34|His brows furrowed and his eyes suddenly turned cold.
1:1:45|1:1:51|That night, the woman with the eggs came to the door again seeking help, and [Ouyang Feng] squatted at the door, staring at her.
1:2:1|1:2:4|The woman holding the basket tightened her grip involuntarily.
1:2:15|1:2:32|After speaking, he stood up and returned to the room. After a while, [Ouyang Feng] took an umbrella and stood at the door, looking from a distance at the woman he had rejected. The desert stretched endlessly, with misty waves, and the woman's figure appeared particularly small. The martial world was treacherous, and human hearts were hard to fathom.
1:2:32|1:2:36|[Ouyang Feng], as a middleman, prefers not to get involved in disputes, and no one can blame him.
1:2:37|1:2:48|[Girl] leaned against a wooden stake at the end of the road, exuding a sense of powerlessness all over. Her face was pale, but her eyes looked firmly towards the other end, where [Hong Qi] was staring at her.
1:2:59|1:3:15|The rain-drenched swordsman wiped the rain off his face. At this moment, [Hong Qi] strode in with a sword in hand. The surrounding swordsmen looked at him with doubt in their eyes, but more so with caution. The leading swordsman shouted, and everyone rushed forward to confront [Hong Qi].
1:3:16|1:3:34|Countless swords flashed before his eyes, but he didn't pay attention and was kicked by one of them, causing his hat to be split in half. Then, [Hong Qi] immediately jumped up from the table and flew towards the person on the empty ground, a deep wound appeared at the person's waist.
1:3:34|1:3:53|Seeing that [Hong Qi] was difficult to deal with, the leading fat swordsman took advantage of the chaos to launch a sneak attack. Unable to dodge in time, [Hong Qi] had half of her finger forcibly shaved off. She held up her sword, glaring angrily at the swordsman, enduring the intense pain in her hand. The injured [Tao Hua] was filled with anger, and her movements became even faster.
1:3:53|1:3:55|She quickly turned around, blocking attacks from all directions.
1:3:56|1:4:12|One of the swordsmen couldn't resist the dense attacks from [Hong Qi], and was kicked down the stairs, falling onto the stove. Afterwards, [Hong Qi] leaped down from upstairs, and the fat swordsman took the initiative to confront him. However, before he could react, the intense pain in his ear made him cry out involuntarily.
1:4:13|1:4:32|At that moment, anger surged in the swordsman's heart. Unexpectedly, [Tao Hua] moved faster, and another ear was swiftly cut off. After enduring repeated attacks, the swordsman was covered in wounds. [Tao Hua] forcefully pulled the knife out of the opponent's abdomen, causing him to spurt out blood and fall straight down.
1:4:44|1:4:50|Hong Qi, already bandaged, lay on the bed, turning his head to watch Ouyang Feng playing with tossed eggs.
1:4:59|1:5:4|Hong Qi opened his eyes and looked at the ceiling, then turned to Ouyang Feng beside him.
1:5:41|1:5:43|[Ouyang Feng] put down the hand holding the egg, showing a smile, then tossed the egg up and played with it casually.
1:6:27|1:6:39|Listening to the contemptuous laughter of [Hong Qi], [Ouyang Feng]'s face instantly turned sinister, the anger in his eyes barely concealed. But when he turned to look at [Hong Qi] again, his emotions seemed to have suddenly disappeared.
1:6:42|1:6:48|[Ouyang Feng]'s eating motion froze at that moment, the woman shed a tear and bowed her head deeply.
1:7:7|1:7:18|After speaking, he took a sip of water from a wooden ladle, then threw the ladle into the water tank, causing small ripples. [Ouyang Feng] wiped his mouth and then stood behind the woman.
1:7:37|1:7:39|He smugly leaned close to the woman's embroidered hair.
1:7:52|1:8:6|With a sly gleam in his eyes, he then turned around coldly and left with his hands behind his back. Inside the room, the dying Hong Qi slowly grasped the woman's hand. Struggling to comfort the grieving woman, the powerless [Hong Qi] took a deep breath.
1:8:31|1:8:37|Later, the weak [Hong Qi] struggled to lift his head and looked at the woman in front of him who dared not raise her head due to guilt.
1:8:51|1:9:9|The woman cried bitterly in front of [Hong Qi], lying beside her, [Hong Qi] tried hard to move her body, staying close to her head. Just as dawn was breaking, [Hong Qi]'s wife sat on the hilltop, humming a tune, a smile on her face that she couldn't contain, her hands busy with needlework without pause.
1:9:9|1:9:18|She carefully examined the straw shoes in her hand, starting from each stitch, carefully checking one stitch at a time, her white teeth shining brightly on her dark face.
1:9:19|1:9:35|A few days later, [Hong Qi] returned home. He lay on the hammock, casually placing his hand on top of his head. His wife sat on the opposite hammock, scooping a spoonful of rice from a bowl, singing as she handed it to him. [Hong Qi] raised his head and ate up all the rice.
1:9:35|1:9:44|Turning his head, closing his eyes, chewing slowly, the swing beneath him swayed more vigorously. On the other side, the woman holding the eggs left with a donkey.
1:9:46|1:10:0|The figure of the woman and the donkey gradually disappeared into the night. The scene shifted, showing a right hand wrapped in burlap, laboriously chopping wood. Then, he switched the axe to his left hand. Soon, the firewood was split open.
1:10:3|1:10:8|Ouyang Feng, who was eating watermelon, stopped, spat out the watermelon seeds in his mouth, and licked his lips.
1:10:34|1:10:37|Shortly after, [Ouyang Feng] got up and walked outside.
1:10:58|1:11:6|A few days later, [Ouyang Feng] arrived at the crossroads with a heavy expression on his face, looking solemnly at the red paint about to be left behind.
1:11:44|1:12:3|In the scene, [Hong Qi] is leading a camel through the desert, with his wife sitting on the camel's hump. [Ouyang Feng] stands on a high ground, watching their departing figures from afar. The figures of Hong Qi and his wife gradually recede into the distance, until they reach a shady tree. However, they do not stop at all, but continue on towards the unknown path.
1:12:3|1:12:13|At this moment, [Ouyang Feng] still stood in place, his hair being tousled even more by the fierce wind blowing from above, causing the tattered flag above his head to sway freely with the powerful gusts.
1:12:14|1:12:32|He then turned around and looked back for a moment before returning. A large dark cloud was rapidly approaching the clear sky, and the fierce wind in the desert was even stronger than on the mountain tops. At this moment, [Hong Qi]'s figure was already shrouded in sand and wind, he frowned and looked back at the place where he had lived for a long time.
1:12:45|1:12:57|[Hong Qi] and his wife gradually walked away, their figures appearing particularly small in the vast desert. Even if there were violent winds blocking their path ahead, they would not stop their steps against the wind.
1:13:26|1:13:45|In the scene, a woman stands alone on a high mountain ridge. The time goes back to the night of her wedding day. The woman is dressed in a wedding gown, holding a candle as she quietly approaches a house. Just before entering, she adjusts her hair, then without hesitation, she pushes the door open and takes a peek inside.
1:13:46|1:14:2|He peered left and right through the crack in the door, then closed it after a while. The woman lingered in front of the door for a moment, ready to turn back. Just as she was about to leave, he suddenly stopped, quietly glanced behind him, only to see the woman's eyes moving rapidly, her mind also racing.
1:14:2|1:14:5|Soon after, he quickly made his way through the corridor with a candle in hand.
1:14:6|1:14:23|Before long, the woman arrived at another corridor. She walked lightly and swiftly turned at the corner, all the while keeping her eyes fixed on the floor below. Soon, she reached the staircase, where she held onto the railing with one hand and carried a bamboo tray with the other, swiftly moving her legs downstairs.
1:14:23|1:14:44|Walking halfway, the woman suddenly stopped, raised the hand holding the bamboo tray forward, roughly observing the surrounding environment. The young [Ouyang Feng] hid in the shadows, quietly watching the woman's every move. The woman turned back and went upstairs again, preparing to leave. [Murong Yan] looked at her, unable to help but recall the night of the wedding.
1:15:5|1:15:18|The woman resisted [Ouyang Feng]'s rough behavior, and the bamboo tray in her hand was thrown out, falling to the ground below with a collision sound. At this moment, a lake appeared in the scene, with a person washing a handkerchief in the water.
1:15:18|1:15:31|Previously, the woman whom [Huang Yaoshi] went to search for was looking at that person from a distance. The camera gradually moved up, only to see that the person washing the handkerchief was [Ouyang Feng]. He noticed the woman staring at him, then stopped and stood in front of her.
1:15:42|1:15:56|[Ouyang Feng] hesitated for a moment upon hearing this, not knowing how to respond. It turned out that the person standing in front of him was the wife of the man who died in the desert. The woman's face appeared and disappeared in the moonlight, her eyes fixed on the gold ingot in [Ouyang Feng]'s hand.
1:15:56|1:16:7|Later, she turned around and lay on the horse's belly, twisting her head towards the side without light. Upon hearing this, [Ouyang Feng] walked beside him and handed him the Han gold.
1:16:16|1:16:27|The woman did not look back, silently took the handkerchief from him and wiped away her tears. He held the handkerchief tightly, his fingers constantly rubbing against each other. After a moment, he lowered his head and prepared to leave.
1:16:30|1:16:36|The woman's face showed not sorrow but numbness, with her hair casually falling on her face.
1:16:38|1:16:54|There were no peach blossoms in this place, "Peach Blossom" was just a woman's name. The calm lake surface was covered with a thin layer of cool mist, like a faint green sand. When the woman named Tao Hua returned home, she tightly hugged the horse's neck and vented her inner pain.
1:17:19|1:17:23|The rolling waves are surging towards the endless horizon in the scene.
1:17:41|1:17:48|A child squats by the shore, quietly gazing at the sea. At this moment, [Ouyang Feng]'s sister-in-law leans her upper body against the window, staring straight outside.
1:18:38|1:18:43|Ouyang Feng's sister-in-law turned around and lightly tapped her fingers on the windowsill.
1:19:5|1:19:9|His face showed a proud expression, but his eyes were moist.
1:19:37|1:19:47|[Huang Yaoshi] opened his mouth and took a bite of the freshly peeled pear, but his eyes were fixed on [Ouyang Feng]'s sister-in-law. The sunlight outside the window shone on her, making her look particularly gentle.
1:21:9|1:21:18|His eyes were clear and beautiful, gazing at the distant scenery. A touch of melancholy was evident on his elegant and graceful face, as the flower in his hand had already withered beyond recognition.
1:21:50|1:22:12|If one could start over, transcending the mundane and not seeking pleasure, often one cannot regret what has passed. The time in the past is like water that cannot be recovered, disappearing in the blink of an eye. Now he understands, some emotions, once missed, are lost for a lifetime. He gently tilted his head against the window frame, his eyes becoming dim and lifeless, then couldn't help but let out a deep sigh.
1:22:13|1:22:30|Not long after, he turned his head to the other side, his hand holding the wilted flower weakly hanging by his side. Then he stood up, took heavy steps towards the nearby carpet. On the table, there was a mirror placed. He slowly knelt down and then collapsed to sit on one side.
1:22:30|1:22:33|He then started tidying up his messy hair in front of the mirror.
1:22:35|1:22:47|He raised his hand, tucked a strand of hair behind his ear, and gently pushed back the loose hair at the back of his head. Then, he slightly turned to the side and started tidying up the stray hair on the other side.
1:23:3|1:23:8|He was puzzled for a few seconds, then turned back and smiled.
1:23:12|1:23:34|He wanted to say something more, but helplessly turned his head, tears streaming down uncontrollably. He regretfully scratched his messy hair with his hands, eyes closed in frustration over everything he had done in the past. The silent pain weighed heavily on him, leaving him exhausted. He shook his head heavily, large tears sliding down from his eyes.
1:23:34|1:23:39|The tears are filled with complex emotions, a mix of sadness and a sense of helplessness at the mercy of fate.
1:23:58|1:24:19|The lake water flows day after day without stopping, while time passes by day by day. [Ouyang Feng]'s sister-in-law still leans by the window as usual, but this time she is holding a beautiful flower. Her face is painted with delicate makeup, but it cannot hide the exhaustion. Her eyes have become dull and lifeless.
1:24:19|1:24:26|Her eyes lost their former color, like a ruin worn down by time, and finally she slowly closed her eyes.
1:24:57|1:25:7|In the scene, [Ouyang Feng]'s sister-in-law closed her eyes tightly, with a hint of contentment on her lips. After that day, [Huang Yaoshi] also left the place.
1:25:49|1:25:56|After the spring, it quickly came to Jing Shi. Every year at this time, a friend would come to see me.
1:25:59|1:26:11|[Ouyang Feng] stood at the door, wiping the smell of alcohol from his hands with a handkerchief. He then took a deep breath and continued to wipe, but his eyes kept glancing towards the other side of the desert.
1:26:11|1:26:21|He stood there waiting until nightfall, but his friend never came. Time passed like sand blown away by the wind, silently slipping away.
1:28:13|1:28:20|In his youth, Ouyang Feng may have already destined the tragedy of this love when he left White Camel Mountain.
1:30:29|1:30:47|Before leaving, [Ouyang Feng] set fire to his inn. The raging fire released fireworks that seemed like a phoenix breaking through the clouds. The wild flames burned everything here recklessly, one after another.
1:31:10|1:31:29|Endless sand spread across this vast land, with bare gravel everywhere. The sky was filled with white mist, obscuring any view of the surroundings, only the outlines of layers of trees could be seen in the distance. That touch of vitality different from the desert injected life into the originally silent sea of sand.
1:31:29|1:31:38|[Murong Yan] returned to the lakeside where he once met him, but only his lonely reflection was seen in the lake. It was at this moment that he truly felt the essence of loneliness.
1:31:39|1:31:53|Years later, [Ouyang Feng] encountered a group of people wandering in the martial world. The leader among them wielded a weapon different from the others, a dog-beating staff. After several rounds, [Ouyang Feng] remained unscathed, leaving the man looking up in astonishment.
1:32:1|1:32:17|At the same time, a swordsman holding an oiled-paper umbrella flew over, with a sword in one hand and the umbrella handle in the other, descending from the sky. In an instant, blood splattered everywhere, and the person in male attire was none other than [Murong Yan].
