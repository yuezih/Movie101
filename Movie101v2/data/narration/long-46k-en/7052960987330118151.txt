0:2:1|0:2:14|[Shen Mo] is speaking on stage, but the male leader is taking selfies below. When the employees hear that there is money to be made, they enthusiastically applaud.
0:3:39|0:3:44|[Shen Mo] respectfully finished his drink, casually took the phone on the table, and left the banquet. Later, he placed the phone in the dishes of the waiter.
0:4:3|0:4:18|The police officer who was speaking suddenly saw a cellphone in the food brought in, with a photo of the thief king on it. On the other side, [Shen Mo] pushed open a door abruptly, [Shen Mo] solemnly patted the suitcase beside him.
0:4:28|0:4:40|While [Shen Mo] was getting angry, a group of police officers rushed into the thief king's banquet hall. The police officers then leaped onto the table and ran a few steps, directly grabbing the thief king who was drinking.
0:4:48|0:4:55|[Shen Mo] finished speaking and walked away with the suitcase to the hotel lobby. At this moment, the lobby was in chaos as the police were arresting the criminal gang.
0:5:22|0:5:38|[Shen Mo], who helped the police successfully take down the criminal gang, arrived at the bar at nightfall. He held a glass of wine, embraced beautiful women, drank the liquor in his hand with gusto, and played games with them. The next moment, he sat alone in the private room, pondering about life with a sense of loneliness.
0:5:57|0:6:16|[Shen Mo] was immersed in the extravagant atmosphere, when suddenly blood started flowing from his nose. He seemed to sense something, casually wiped it away, but the next moment he fainted. As the day broke, [Shen Mo] slowly regained consciousness lying in a hospital bed wearing a patient gown.
0:6:48|0:6:53|[Shen Mo] watches the doctor's lip movements through the glass and realizes that his time is running out.
0:7:1|0:7:22|[Shen Mo] was then sitting in a wheelchair, being pushed out of the ward by a nurse. The police officer who had caught the thief king was walking in the hospital corridor at the same time. He should have met [Shen Mo], but instead he saw the nurse pushing an empty wheelchair past him.
0:7:24|0:7:51|In the bustling street, two children holding donation boxes ask passersby for help. Suddenly, a man wearing a gold ring approaches them, stuffing a large amount of cash from his pocket into the donation box before leaving casually, leaving the children puzzled. Inside a room filled with wine bottles, [Shen Mo] sits down and takes a sip of water from a glass.
0:7:52|0:7:55|Transferring 1 million to Hope via computer操作着.
0:8:2|0:8:16|In the bank hall, [Shen Mo] held the remittance form for the Boai Assistance Committee of Ping'an County, picked up a pen but found it out of ink. He blew on the pen tip, but it was of no use. A stranger next to him finished filling out the form and left her pen on the self-service counter.
0:8:16|0:8:24|Shen Mo quickly stepped forward to pick up the pen and fill it out upon seeing the situation, but as he lowered his head, blood dripped from his nose.
0:9:5|0:9:17|[Shen Mo] staggered to the table with the dishes and the guests couldn't wait to start enjoying the food. After that, [Shen Mo] turned back to the kitchen to wash the vegetables.
0:9:28|0:9:43|The landlady brandished a kitchen knife and threatened, but before she could finish her sentence, the customers in the shop suddenly fell to the ground convulsing. The landlord looked at [Shen Mo] walking away and said to his wife in panic:
0:10:34|0:10:49|The customer who was just convulsing all over is now deftly transferring the money of the restaurant owner. It turns out he is [Du Yu], the accomplice of [Shen Mo]. On the other end of the phone, the restaurant owner is angrily tapping the screen, watching the balance drop to only ten.
0:11:36|0:11:42|[Du Yu] pointed to the Hermes bag on the computer and introduced it to [Shen Mo], but [Shen Mo] remained indifferent.
0:11:51|0:12:4|He walked to the corner and opened the door, [Shen Mo] holding a takeout box, said: "The spilled takeout dirtied the young man's shoes."
0:13:7|0:13:25|[Shen Mo] successfully joined Mr. Jia's company. As he walked out of the company, nodding and bowing, he suddenly turned cold the moment the company door closed. He turned around, unbuttoned his shirt, and walked into the dim corridor, where the walls were covered with all kinds of small advertisements.
0:13:25|0:13:51|[Shen Mo] took off the delivery man's clothes, turned them over, and found a suit. He casually put on the suit, then suddenly stopped after descending a floor. He buttoned up his shirt, opened the fire hydrant in front of him, took out a comb, and started combing his hair. After ensuring his appearance was fine, he took a bag from the fire hydrant, turned a corner, and entered the Trustworthy Pharmaceutical Company.
0:14:56|0:15:8|[Shen Mo] signaled to the three henchmen, who waved goodbye to him. Then [Yao Zong] arrived at the clinic to collect debts, and the doctor looked thoughtfully at the bag on his back.
0:15:48|0:16:14|[Yao Zong] had just left on a tricycle, and the elderly couple who were still receiving treatment immediately rushed out of the clinic without a word, taking a shortcut to catch up. The three of them chased each other, but the elderly woman couldn't run anymore. She said to her husband, "Just as she finished speaking, [Yao Zong] passed by them. The old man quickly followed, sitting down on the road where [Yao Zong] was about to pass. Unexpectedly, he turned the corner on his bike, and the elderly woman hurried over.
0:16:18|0:16:33|[Yao Zong] is completely unaware of all this, but [Shen Mo] sees everything clearly. [Shen Mo] then returns to the fake medicine factory, where the three henchmen burst into laughter while watching the live broadcast. However, the [Shen Mo] at the back is lost in thought.
0:16:44|0:16:59|When the henchman looked at [Shen Mo], he burst into laughter, but when the henchman turned away, [Shen Mo] returned to his expressionless face.
0:17:39|0:17:50|Wearing a cheongsam and with her curly hair pinned up, the female anchor [Ma Xiaoli] finished singing. People in the live broadcast room started to leave, but she didn't feel discouraged. She composed herself again and spoke to the audience:
0:17:58|0:18:11|The words were not finished yet, all the viewers in the live broadcast room had already left. [Ma Xiaoli] walked out of the room feeling lost, gently pushed open the door next door, only to see [Lan Lan] dressed in a cute princess outfit, fake singing while acting cute in front of the camera.
0:18:22|0:18:35|[Lan Lan]'s live streaming room is packed with viewers, comments, and flower gifts filling the entire screen. [Ma Xiaoli] stands outside the door, expressionless for a moment, then sadly closes the door. She quietly walks to the kitchen, puts on an apron, picks up a knife, and starts cooking.
0:19:32|0:19:38|Qiqi showed off her low-cut camisole, [Ma Xiaoli] lowered her head and shook her own clothes.
0:20:0|0:20:14|[Ma Xiaoli] changed into a cute outfit, but there was still no popularity in the live broadcast room. She sent a message to the only viewer in the room: "Thank you for your support."
0:20:14|0:20:40|The other party only replied with the words "Acting Bible". She quickly asked who the other party was, but the audience did not reply. Instead, they directly turned off the computer. The darkened screen reflected the shadow of [Shen Mo]. He took out a book called "Acting Bible" and started writing and drawing on it. Just as he wrote a few words, he was interrupted by a vibrating sound. He picked up his phone and saw that it was a call from Zhu Ge at the restaurant.
0:20:48|0:20:54|The restaurant owner Zhu who ran away earlier got scared and quickly hung up the phone. [Shen Mo] called back.
0:21:2|0:21:13|Zhu Ge watched as Shen Mo's call kept ringing without daring to answer. Feeling desperate, he knelt in front of the statue of Guan Gong, hoping for blessings. Feeling not devout enough, he also asked his wife to kneel with him.
0:21:16|0:21:23|Late at night, the drunken and scantily clad beauty [Xiao Wei] gets out of the car and staggers towards the residential area.
0:21:23|0:21:38|On the other side, [Shen Mo]'s accomplice [Du Yu] was eating and watching Japanese anime. In the anime, the female lead said to the male lead, "Love at first sight is not without reason." Seeing this, [Du Yu] was so moved that tears almost welled up in his eyes.
0:21:38|0:21:46|At this moment, there was a knock on the door. Shen Mo turned his head towards the door with extreme impatience and then asked:
0:22:0|0:22:22|Opening the door, it was a hug from [Xiao Wei], leaving [Du Yu] stunned. [Du Yu] accompanied [Xiao Wei] for a drink, and after clinking glasses, before [Xiao Wei] could put down her cup, [Du Yu] quickly took it from her.
0:22:28|0:22:38|[Du Yu] poured a glass of wine, [Xiao Wei] held the wine glass in contemplation, then raised it up again. The two of them then went outside.
0:23:32|0:23:50|[Xiao Wei] finished speaking, and suddenly it started to rain heavily in the sky. [Du Yu] happily opened an umbrella, and the two of them looked like a beautiful picture in the rain. As the day broke, [Shen Mo] had already arrived at Mr. Jia's company for work. He spoke fluent Mandarin and teased the old man and lady on the phone who were trying to scam him by pinching his throat.
0:24:6|0:24:24|[Shen Mo] put down the phone satisfactorily and asked Mr. Jia, who gave him a thumbs up. Looking at the words "transaction successful" on the computer screen, Mr. Jia was first stunned, then clapped his hands in joy and stood up.
0:24:34|0:24:48|Ailian responded and walked out, [Shen Mo] then sat down, touched the red dragon fish statue, and unplugged the network cable. The boss sitting in front of the computer without internet frowned and said:
0:25:38|0:25:46|Shen Mo secretly inserted the USB drive into the computer to copy data, when suddenly Mr. Jia looked over at the computer and then turned to him to inquire,
0:26:18|0:26:36|At the same time, the female anchor [Ma Xiaoli] changed her style. She wore a small hat on her head, with slightly curled hair hanging on her shoulders. She put on a cute pig-themed cover on the computer screen. Closing her eyes, she followed the rhythm of the music. The live chat room was flooded with gifts from the audience. With full confidence, she started singing:
0:26:51|0:26:58|On the screen, [Ma Xiaoli] finished singing in one go, feeling very pleased, and then shouted loudly.
0:28:19|0:28:26|[Du Yu] saw that [Shen Mo] remained silent, so he had to change the subject.
0:29:22|0:29:40|Shen Mo threw the tablet in front of General Yao, and on the screen was the female anchor Ma Xiaoli, who had received an endorsement invitation. Ma Xiaoli, dressed in formal attire and high heels, walked out of the subway station. She only took a few steps before twisting her ankle due to the discomfort of the high heels. She stood by the roadside, and a bouncing car passed in front of her.
0:29:40|0:29:49|She looked behind and saw no other vehicles, so she quickly caught up with the just-departed buggy.
0:30:14|0:30:22|[Shen Mo] in a suit waved to [Ma Xiaoli] and walked towards her with an umbrella, but was stopped by Mr. Jia.
0:31:12|0:31:22|[Du Yu] sat at the front desk and received a message from [Xiao Wei] saying she wanted to drink love soup. He then replied with a silly smile: "Will be delivered later." Not far away, Boss Yao instructed his henchmen:
0:31:30|0:31:36|General Yao was startled by [Ma Xiaoli], who awkwardly took off her sunglasses and looked at General Yao.
0:31:55|0:32:4|[Du Yu] intended to go to the restaurant next door to order food, but as soon as he stepped out, he saw the owner of the restaurant next door closing the shop.
0:32:23|0:32:36|[Du Yu] was completely dumbfounded, while inside the restaurant, [Ma Xiaoli] and Yao Zong also remained silent at the dining table, creating an extremely awkward atmosphere. After dealing with Jia Zong, [Shen Mo] hurried to the restaurant. He placed the umbrella in his hand on the front desk and walked up to [Ma Xiaoli].
0:33:43|0:33:59|[Shen Mo] was speaking when he looked up and saw Mr. Jia approaching with his men. About to be exposed, [Shen Mo] quickly reassured [Ma Xiaoli], turned and walked towards the door. He put on a flattering smile, hurried over to Mr. Jia.
0:34:25|0:34:47|Mr. Jia finished speaking and walked towards the store. Ailian walked up to [Shen Mo] with a stern face and said angrily, "After Ailian left in anger, [Shen Mo]'s expression changed from flattering to sharp, and he followed them. Just as Mr. Jia entered the restaurant, he greeted [Ma Xiaoli], then turned to face Ailian.
0:34:56|0:35:1|[Shen Mo], who came in later, deliberately turned up the music in the store and then walked up to [Ma Xiaoli].
0:35:7|0:35:14|[Du Yu] is preparing food in the kitchen, when [Shen Mo] comes in and says to him:
0:35:39|0:35:51|After [Du Yu] finished speaking, he picked up his phone. Inside the restaurant, Manager Jia placed a bottle of wine on the table and instructed his subordinates.
0:37:15|0:37:38|In the kitchen, from day to dusk until nightfall, [Du Yu] is busy cooking, frying fish and vegetables at the same time. In the midst of the hustle, he even picks up the spatula with both hands to cook. For the sake of one hundred thousand yuan, he is really risking his life. Expressionless, he dishes out the cooked dishes, while [Shen Mo] next to him carries the dishes to the people in the restaurant. He smiles, stands tall with confidence, and serves the dishes to [Ma Xiaoli] at the table.
0:37:38|0:37:43|With a fawning smile, Shen Mo bowed and handed the dishes to [Mr. Jia] at the table.
0:37:43|0:38:1|[Jia Zong] raised his glass and stood up upon seeing the situation, [Shen Mo] obediently clinked glasses with [Jia Zong] and colleagues, while the unfortunate [Du Yu] tirelessly cooked in the kitchen. In the modern city, the tablecloths and decorations in the restaurant were all in the style of Northeast China's big flower cloth, just like him, completely out of place with the city.
0:38:1|0:38:22|[Shen Mo] repeated the steps of serving dishes to everyone over and over again. Facing two different tables, he switched between different expressions and identities skillfully. He calmly faced two different groups of people with different identities, showing confidence when facing [Ma Xiaoli] and flattery when facing [Mr. Jia]. Which one is the real him?
0:38:22|0:38:36|He probably doesn't even know himself. Like an actor who has received countless honors, he portrays his perfect performance in real life with two different emotions and faces.
0:38:37|0:38:54|After serving the final dish to two more tables, [Shen Mo] walked over to the table of [Jia Zong] and his colleagues, raised his glass to toast them, then returned to the table of [Ma Xiaoli] and Yao Zong. He calmly sat down at the table, then casually crossed his legs in a relaxed manner.
0:38:54|0:39:6|[Shen Mo] was talking to [Ma Xiaoli] about the follow-up plan for his product endorsement. In the kitchen, [Du Yu] was busy cooking and listening to him, looking over with a speechless expression.
0:39:45|0:39:52|[Mr. Jia] listened to [Shen Mo]'s words, awkwardly chuckled twice, and then spoke:
0:40:31|0:40:39|[Shen Mo] turned his head and saw the two holding hands tightly. His sharp eyes fixed on them, and only when Mr. Yao let go of his hand did he turn to look at [Mr. Jia].
0:40:46|0:40:55|[Ma Xiaoli] looked at [Shen Mo] in the mirror and smiled knowingly. As they walked on the street, [Shen Mo] asked [Ma Xiaoli]:
0:41:28|0:41:44|[Ma Xiaoli] suddenly sprained her ankle. Just as she was about to fall, [Shen Mo] hooked a foot on a tree and grabbed her with one hand, saving her from danger. After a while, [Shen Mo] suddenly spoke, with a nosebleed flowing as he talked.
0:41:45|0:42:0|The two arrived at the roadside, [Ma Xiaoli] holding high heels trying to hail a taxi, but after a while without success, she had to sit back on a stone bench by the street. [Shen Mo] was beside her, tilting his head back to wipe his nosebleed. Seeing [Ma Xiaoli] returning empty-handed, he thought for a moment before speaking:
0:42:55|0:43:16|[Shen Mo] watched as the taxi drove away, the smile on his face gradually fading. On the other side, [Du Yu] carried the stew he had cooked in his hands and knocked on a door. At that moment, an expensive luxury car pulled up downstairs, and a burly middle-aged man got out of the car. His bodyguards held umbrellas as they escorted this extraordinary big shot into the building. Meanwhile, the door in front of [Du Yu] upstairs was opened.
0:43:16|0:43:22|He looked at Xiao Wei in the room and exclaimed with surprise:
0:43:42|0:43:58|[Du Yu] awkwardly said after hearing this: [Du Yu] could no longer laugh, only nodding with a blank expression.
0:43:58|0:44:24|At the same time, the elevator that the boss was riding stopped on their floor. As he walked out of the elevator and turned the corner, [Du Yu] passed by carrying a bowl of noodles expressionlessly and got on the elevator. On the other side, [Xiao Wei] leaned against the door, crying and wiping her tears. Upon hearing a knock on the door, she quickly forced a smile, turned around, and opened the door, only to find the boss who had just gone upstairs standing outside.
0:44:25|0:44:31|The boss finished speaking and immediately tore [Xiao Wei]'s clothes, then he walked into the inner room without any concern.
0:44:32|0:44:41|At the restaurant, as the dinner was not over yet, General Yao staggered towards General Jia with a wine glass in hand, only to be noticed by [Shen Mo], who had just brought Ma Xiaoli back.
0:45:3|0:45:14|Mr. Yao immediately threw the wine glass and said, "Seeing the two about to fight, [Shen Mo] quickly picked up a wine glass at the front desk and smashed it on the ground."
0:45:38|0:46:8|Shen Mo had a bad feeling and directly overturned the table. Mr. Yao, seeing this scene, quickly ran away, almost bumping into Du Yu who was returning with soup. Shen Mo's face wrinkled up and he burst into tears. Du Yu hurriedly stepped forward and said, helping Shen Mo, who pretended to be unwell, to leave.
0:46:14|0:46:22|At the closed restaurant at night, [Du Yu] said to [Shen Mo]:
0:46:41|0:46:56|[Du Yu] turned around and kicked over a bottle after hearing this, then sat down on a stool dejectedly. [Shen Mo] opened the rolling shutter and coldly said to him: He finished his words with his back to [Du Yu], and at that moment, his nose started bleeding, which he casually wiped away.
0:46:56|0:47:13|[Du Yu] looked at his back and didn't see him in a sorry state. [Shen Mo] then left expressionlessly. Suddenly, a notification sound rang out. [Du Yu] took out his phone from his pocket and stared at the screen for a moment. The one sending the text asking him to scram was [Xiao Wei], with the message: "Teach me how to make soup."
0:47:13|0:47:26|[Du Yu] looked at the text message and couldn't help but smile. In the distance, a car passed by the entrance of the restaurant, where [Du Yu] inside was excitedly dancing with a broom, like a chubby butterfly dancing in a flower garden.
0:47:26|0:47:33|The sky gradually brightened, and [Ma Xiaoli] and her sisters were leisurely practicing yoga at home. At that moment, she suddenly spoke up and asked:
0:47:43|0:48:14|The sisters' words made [Ma Xiaoli] feel embarrassed. She cleared her mind and focused on practicing yoga. After finishing, she stepped on the scale, which showed 122.55 pounds. This number troubled her. She didn't believe it and tapped the scale. Looking at it with a worried expression, [Ma Xiaoli] suddenly seemed to remember something. She shifted her gaze to the weight loss pills given to her by [Shen Mo]. After taking them, she indeed had stomach issues.
0:49:9|0:49:16|The head of the agency handed a business card to [Shen Mo], who looked at it and quipped:
0:49:27|0:49:42|[Shen Mo] turned around and saw [Ma Xiaoli], and smiled when he saw her in a waitress uniform.
0:49:49|0:49:58|[Ma Xiaoli] finished speaking and turned to leave. The woman next to her looked at [Shen Mo] as if mocking him. [Shen Mo] ran after [Ma Xiaoli] and took out two cucumbers, saying to her:
0:50:22|0:50:27|Walking back to her home, Shen Mo returned to find herself sitting on the toilet, exhausted, holding diet pills. There was a knock on the door outside the bathroom.
0:50:38|0:50:51|On the other side, [Shen Mo] was washing vegetables in the kitchen of the restaurant. She saw [Ma Xiaoli] and her two sisters walking towards them from a distance. She said something to [Du Yu], who was playing on his phone. Upon hearing her, [Du Yu] immediately started cutting vegetables. At that moment, a customer approached him and said,
0:50:54|0:51:5|The customer inexplicably turned and left, [Shen Mo] walked to the garbage pile holding the trash, and said to [Ma Xiaoli] and others who were heading home:
0:51:23|0:51:32|[Lan Lan] also followed closely, saying, "[Shen Mo] helped them carry things back home, looking exhausted."
0:52:1|0:52:13|[Lan Lan] awkwardly smiled, waved goodbye, before finishing her sentence, she locked [Shen Mo] outside the door. [Shen Mo] outside the door regained his expressionless state, turned around and left. Just then, the door suddenly opened, and [Ma Xiaoli] urgently asked:
0:53:1|0:53:7|[Shen Mo] smiled and said to her with a very serious expression:
0:53:44|0:53:49|He picked up a receipt from the Angel Foundation remittance, and after putting it down, he continued:
0:54:17|0:54:37|[Ma Xiaoli] finished speaking and then saw a cockroach. [Shen Mo] held up insecticide and sprayed wildly, pulling [Ma Xiaoli] away. [Ma Xiaoli] fiercely stomped on it. Back at home, [Shen Mo] flipped through the script, feeling a bit bored. He put down the book, got up, and walked out.
0:54:37|0:54:43|On the other side, Ma Xiaoli is eating snacks, Lan Lan suddenly asks her,
0:55:46|0:56:10|After hanging up the phone, [Shen Mo] turned to signal to his colleague, who gave a thumbs-up gesture. Mr. Jia next to him also raised his thumb in approval. However, [Shen Mo]'s expression darkened as he turned back. He reminded [Du Yu], who was playing on his phone in the restaurant. Then he noticed [Ma Xiaoli] and others having dinner in the restaurant. Just as he was about to leave, he was spotted by someone, so he had to strike up a conversation.
0:56:32|0:56:47|In the midst of laughter, [Du Yu] suddenly turned his head and reprimanded: the restaurant next door has temporarily closed, [Shen Mo] is standing at the door with a list, in a dilemma.
0:57:5|0:57:11|[Shen Mo] frantically gestured towards [Du Yu], who finally couldn't take it anymore and shouted at him loudly:
0:57:32|0:57:40|In the kitchen, [Shen Mo] is so clumsy that she even knocks over a bowl while frying an egg. Unable to bear it, [Du Yu], who has just entered the kitchen, speaks up.
0:58:21|0:58:29|[Ma Xiaoli] smiled and turned to the kitchen. As she entered the kitchen, her smile gradually faded. [Shen Mo] silently watched her from behind.
0:58:41|0:58:50|[Shen Mo] turned and entered the kitchen, [Ma Xiaoli] was crying sadly in the kitchen. When she saw [Shen Mo] coming in, she quickly turned around to wipe away her tears. [Shen Mo] looked at her with a heavy heart.
0:59:27|0:59:38|Seeing [Shen Mo] remaining silent, [Ma Xiaoli] continued to cook with her head down, while sarcastically commenting: "After she finishes sorting out her emotions, she will walk out of the kitchen with a smile."
0:59:44|0:59:51|As the sky darkens, [Xiao Wei] stands on the balcony, anxiously making a phone call.
1:0:12|1:0:34|[Xiao Wei] nervously picked up the phone, hung up before the big shot finished speaking, unaware that every move of hers was being monitored by the other party. Meanwhile, [Du Yu] was lying on the bed playing games, casually dismissing the news notification about the mysterious tycoon [He Dachang] being involved in illegal activities. [Du Yu] cursed under his breath and continued playing, completely oblivious to the fact that there was a photo of [He Dachang] on the bedside table. Returning from the balcony, [Xiao Wei] hesitated to speak.
1:1:10|1:1:24|The phone smashed the screen on the TV cabinet. He angrily flicked the cigarette to the ground and picked up the landline phone to dial a number, then said familiarly:
1:1:53|1:2:20|Hearing the phone ring, [He Dachang] hurried to get his phone that he had just thrown on the TV cabinet. Just as he stood up, he stepped on the cigarette butt he had thrown, then, because he didn't stand firm, he hit his head on the TV cabinet and passed out. Meanwhile, [Du Yu] left [Xiao Wei]'s house and walked behind [Shen Mo], asking for money.
1:3:12|1:3:31|Upon hearing the warning from [Shen Mo], [Du Yu] angrily left, while [Shen Mo] was writing at the desk and reminiscing about his childhood experiences. A heartless merchant scattered iron nails on the highway, causing a car to accidentally run over them from a distance. Coincidentally, a tractor was driving in the opposite direction on a one-way street, leading the car to flip over in order to avoid the tractor.
1:3:31|1:3:40|The tractor driver got off to check the situation, then drove away, while the adults in the car helped the young [Shen Mo] wipe the blood off his face.
1:4:25|1:4:37|In the dimly lit corridor at night, [Shen Mo] arrived alone at the door of [Ma Xiaoli]'s room. Just as he was about to knock on the door, he felt a tickle in his throat. He bent over, covering his mouth and nose, coughing. Unable to hold on, he squatted down and continued coughing.
1:4:38|1:4:51|[Shen Mo] looked at the things he coughed up without any concern, stood up and prepared to leave, he was like a walking corpse. Just then, [Ma Xiaoli], who was taking out the trash, saw his figure and called out to him.
1:6:16|1:6:21|The two actors' humorous performance amused the audience in front of the computer. The next moment, Boss Yao slapped his subordinate, and then they arrived at the entrance of the restaurant. He took out his phone and called [Shen Mo].
1:6:24|1:6:30|[Shen Mo] glanced at the phone when it rang, saw that it was Yao Dezhi calling, and casually set the phone aside.
1:6:32|1:6:39|Picking up the landline next to him, [Shen Mo] dialed Mr. Yao's number, then took out a tissue and placed it on the microphone before speaking:
1:8:1|1:8:27|After winning this round, General Jia handed two large trophies to [Shen Mo]. [Shen Mo] shyly smiled as she accepted the trophies, with the surrounding employees showing envious expressions. On the other side, the Japanese assassin Yuan Pengjun sneaked into China by boat. He opened the front plank of the boat and took out a dossier bag containing a bank card and several photos of [Du Yu] and [Xiao Wei]. Yuan Pengjun walked on the street with his luggage, his handsome appearance attracting the attention of the news anchor [Lan Lan], who struck up a conversation with him.
1:8:57|1:9:10|[Lan Lan] put her arm around Yuan Pengjun's shoulder and led him into the elevator. The elevator doors opened, and Yuan Pengjun walked out first, with [Lan Lan] following closely behind. She leaned against the elevator, pressing the button and watching Yuan Pengjun.
1:9:16|1:9:26|After confirming [Lan Lan] had left, Yuan Pengjun turned and entered the room, without exploring the new environment inside. Instead, he sat directly at the table and skillfully assembled his high-end telescope.
1:9:28|1:9:40|Then he took it to the balcony, looked across to the opposite floor for a while, and finally found the target he was going to kill this time. He looked at the seemingly dead [Xiao Wei] and [Du Yu] with an evil smile on his face.
1:9:47|1:10:1|[Xiao Wei] paced back and forth in the room muttering to herself, while [Du Yu] sat calmly in front of the computer. On the other side, Yuan Pengjun checked his balance at the bank, entered his password, and smiled satisfactorily when he saw a balance of 5 million.
1:10:2|1:10:28|He had just left after withdrawing his card, while [Du Yu] had already transferred the balance in his card to his own account. Meanwhile, [Shen Mo] in front of the computer also received the news of the huge sum transferred to [Du Yu]'s account. He closed the computer and walked out of the room. Yuan Pengjun was buying medicine at the hospital, handing his bank card to the doctor. However, the doctor was very impatient. With a smile on his face, Yuan Pengjun was stunned. He had just checked the balance at the bank, which had 5 million in the card, but now there was only 10 yuan left.
1:10:29|1:10:45|He angrily took out the card, walked out of the bank, but met [Shen Mo] who was about to enter at the door. After a brief confrontation, they both left on their own. [Shen Mo] removed the mini surveillance device and fake plug stuck on [Du Yu] at the self-service ATM, then turned and left the bank.
1:10:50|1:11:5|Yuan Pengjun called He Dachang to inquire about his bank card balance, unaware that at this moment He Dachang had tripped over a cigarette butt and fallen next to the TV cabinet. Now he could only watch the phone ring without any sensation to answer the call.
1:11:5|1:11:17|Upon returning home, Shen Mo poured the medicine onto the balance scale, mixed it with other white powder in a beaker, stirred it, then lit the alcohol lamp. After completing all this, he revealed an evil smile.
1:11:17|1:11:34|When he got the finished white powder, he fantasized about [Xiao Wei] and [Du Yu] following his instructions to ingest it, causing them to foam at the mouth and stop breathing. He would then disguise them as if they had killed each other, in order to conceal his own criminal acts of murder.
1:11:34|1:11:52|Thinking of this, Shen Mo smiled knowingly. But just then, there was a knock on the door. He put away his smile and got up to open the door. Standing at the door was [Lan Lan], holding a cake. Seeing Yuan Pengjun opening the door, she joyfully said:
1:12:0|1:12:7|After saying that, she entered [Yuan Pengjun]'s room.
1:12:28|1:12:52|On one side, [Shen Mo] is drinking with Boss Jia in the restaurant, while on the other side, [Yuan Pengjun] is brewing juice with his back to [Lan Lan] by the window. [Lan Lan] is taking selfies with her phone at the table, capturing the back view of herself and [Yuan Pengjun]. When she's not paying attention, [Yuan Pengjun] secretly pours the fake weight-loss pills sold by [Shen Mo] into the tea. The reflection on the window reveals his successful conspiracy.
1:12:53|1:13:9|He poured tea into a cup, turned around and walked to the table, handed the tea with weight-loss pills to [Lan Lan], watched her drink it with a smile. After [Lan Lan] finished drinking, she hesitated for a moment and said:
1:13:53|1:14:13|[Yuan Pengjun] angrily licked his lips, picked up a box of Lishen weight loss pills, and began to hypnotize [Lan Lan] by shaking his necklace and chanting: "Look here, look carefully here, relax slowly."
1:15:5|1:15:27|[Ma Xiaoli] was really worried about [Lan Lan] and went out to look for her. Qi Qi, feeling unhappy because of her words, stayed at home sulking. On the other side, [Lan Lan] was hypnotized by [Yuan Pengjun], and she was seen walking while taking off her clothes, then nakedly lying in the bathtub. Finally, she picked up a blade and cut open the vein on her left wrist. Meanwhile, [Yuan Pengjun] stood by the window watching every move of [Du Yu] and [Xiao Wei].
1:15:27|1:15:48|They noticed their movements, and [Yuan Pengjun] also began to prepare. In the restaurant, [Shen Mo] was alone hiding in front of the computer transferring the money from the Light Years account, while Boss Jia and the employees were getting drunk at the table. Boss Jia, who was drunk, lay on the table on the other side of the wall, and Ailian called out to him but got no response.
1:15:52|1:16:0|After a satisfying meal, the group from the scam company helped Mr. Jia leave the restaurant. However, they encountered [Ma Xiaoli] looking for [Lan Lan] on the way.
1:16:0|1:16:34|On the other side, [Du Yu] and [Xiao Wei] just entered the elevator with their suitcases, while [Yuan Pengjun] came out from another elevator. The three brushed past each other, and inside the elevator, [Du Yu] found out that a large sum of money had been transferred out of his account. He gradually put away his smile, and seeing his expression, [Xiao Wei] worriedly asked, "[Yuan Pengjun] opened the door to the corridor, but slipped and fell. He got up and continued walking."
1:16:53|1:17:6|Du Yu, heartbroken, didn't know that his true love had been drugged and taken away by Yuan Pengjun. Yuan Pengjun called He Dachang, but he didn't answer.
1:17:13|1:17:20|He Dachang's phone fell down because of an incoming call vibration.
1:17:28|1:17:35|The old man and old lady who stage accidents for compensation are also here. While [Shen Mo] is submitting the report materials, he listens to [Du Yu].
1:17:59|1:18:19|[Du Yu] had just finished speaking when Yuan Pengjun excitedly stepped on the gas pedal, ready to ram into him. At that moment, the elderly couple who were pretending to be hit suddenly appeared. [Du Yu] witnessed this scene with his own eyes, the sound of the impact reached [Shen Mo]'s ears through the phone receiver. The car hit a tree and stopped, [Du Yu] quickly carried [Xiao Wei] and rushed to the hospital, leaving only the unconscious Yuan Pengjun in the car.
1:18:19|1:18:32|The elderly couple knew they had caused trouble and quickly left the scene of the accident. [Shen Mo] arrived to check on Yuan Pengjun's injuries, followed by [Ma Xiaoli].
1:18:44|1:18:59|[Shen Mo] took the phone handed to him by [Ma Xiaoli], enlarged the picture and looked at it thoughtfully. After a moment, he said to [Ma Xiaoli], "Drunk Mr. Jia is lying on the clinic bed, talking nonsense."
1:19:24|1:19:44|Seeing [Xiao Wei] regain consciousness, [Du Yu] frantically searched for something to treat her from the nearby medical supplies. Meanwhile, [Shen Mo] stood downstairs in the residential area comparing the location in the picture on his phone. On the other side, [Ma Xiaoli] was still guarding the scene of the accident. Before long, Yuan Pengjun woke up from unconsciousness. Seeing this, [Ma Xiaoli] quickly approached and asked:
1:19:58|1:20:14|Yuan Pengjun ignored Ma Xiaoli's questions and got up to leave, while Shen Mo stood in the hallway. He took out tools from his pocket and began to work on Yuan Pengjun's door. In no time, he successfully pried open the door and walked in confidently, then carefully closed the door behind him.
1:20:15|1:20:28|[Shen Mo] entered the room and walked to the table, where he removed the half-eaten cake on top and noticed several newspapers underneath. The newspapers reported the murder of the president of the Yamaguchi-gumi at an izakaya, with suspects including Kitano Ichiro and others.
1:20:34|1:20:45|He then came to the window and saw through the telescope that [Yuan Pengjun] had been monitoring [Du Yu]. His face was solemn as he pondered something. On the other side, [Ma Xiaoli] followed [Yuan Pengjun] to the clinic where [Du Yu] was located. She kept talking incessantly:
1:21:3|1:21:9|A doctor walked out of the room at this time,
1:21:16|1:21:28|[Yuan Pengjun] knocked out all the doctors who came out, locked the clinic door from the inside, and walked from the inside of the clinic. Inside the house, General Jia was still talking to the employees about corporate culture.
1:21:50|1:22:4|He then closed the door and put on the white coat hanging on the hanger. At the same time, Shen Mo finally found Lan Lan lying in the bathtub with her wrists cut in the bathroom.
1:22:9|1:22:20|Walking into the room, [Yuan Pengjun] did not pay attention to Mr. Jia's cries, but went straight towards [Du Yu]. With his back turned to him, [Du Yu] was only concerned about [Xiao Wei]'s injuries, completely unaware that danger was silently approaching.
1:22:20|1:22:37|On the other side, [Shen Mo] quickly found sandpaper and tape to provide basic first aid for the severely bleeding [Lan Lan]. Then he called [Ma Xiaoli], but the voice on the other end was cold. [Shen Mo] hung up the phone immediately, dialed another number quickly, and then picked up a towel and headed towards the bathtub.
1:23:3|1:23:17|[Shen Mo] shouted loudly, then he put [Lan Lan] into the ambulance and asked the doctor, [Shen Mo] hesitated for a moment, then shouted loudly:
1:23:28|1:23:58|[Du Yu] followed [Yuan Pengjun]'s instructions with a knife in hand and walked towards Mr. Jia. After intimidating Mr. Jia, [Du Yu] turned the knife towards [Xiao Wei]. Meanwhile, [Shen Mo] was looking at the map on his phone on the street, then he called [Du Yu]. Hearing the ringtone, [Yuan Pengjun] picked up the phone, which showed an incoming call from Cold Blood. As the phone kept ringing, he reluctantly answered the call.
1:23:58|1:24:14|Shen Mo sensed something was wrong when the other party remained silent, so he started to act. He pretended to be the top Japanese assassin and talked to [Yuan Pengjun].
1:24:34|1:25:4|I am the number one assassin in Japan. If you dare to insult me, I will kill you along with [Yuan Pengjun]. [Yuan Pengjun] replied: I am Yuan Peng from Henggang, I am waiting for you here. Unable to bear it, [Yuan Pengjun] slapped [Du Yu], who was struggling with a human statue. The people around looked at the fainted [Du Yu] and dared not speak. On the other side, [Shen Mo] ran to the clinic with a nosebleed. [Yuan Pengjun] stood in the clinic, looking down at the group of people inside the house.
1:25:4|1:25:26|At this moment, the sound of the clinic door being unlocked was heard. He suddenly looked over, and the people inside also turned to look at the door. [Shen Mo] walked in through the door in front of everyone's eyes, shocking everyone. Despite the stunned looks, [Shen Mo] ignored them and leisurely walked into the room. He pretended to be a Chinese immigrant from Japan and then spoke:
1:25:29|1:25:34|Everyone was stunned after hearing this, [Shen Mo] then said to Yuan Pengjun,
1:26:12|1:26:20|Yuan Pengjun frowned and turned to look at [Shen Mo],
1:26:32|1:26:47|The hypocritical person, [Shen Mo], upon hearing these words, his hand hanging by his side trembled slightly, then clenched his fist, calmly said to Yuan Pengjun: After you. Yuan Pengjun walked out of the room first, [Shen Mo] gave a slight smile to [Ma Xiaoli], then walked out and closed the door behind him.
1:26:47|1:27:3|The two arrived in the clinic lobby ready to settle the score. [Shen Mo] took out a brick from his pocket and quietly approached Yuan Pengjun, who had his back turned, intending to strike. Little did he know that Yuan Pengjun was well-prepared and a kick sent him kneeling on the ground.
1:27:16|1:27:37|Yuan Pengjun completely ignored what [Shen Mo] said, and directly delivered a side kick, knocking him senseless and finally knocking [Shen Mo] to the ground. Immediately after, Yuan Pengjun stepped forward quickly, lifted [Shen Mo] up and threw him against the wall, smirking as he said:
1:27:41|1:28:11|After saying that, he lifted [Shen Mo] up again and slammed him onto the nearby medicine shelf. [Shen Mo] was thrown quite heavily this time. Yuan Pengjun still felt unsatisfied. As [Shen Mo] staggered to his feet, Yuan Pengjun stepped on the table, took off his robe, and kicked him into another room. The noise woke up [Du Yu], who then pointed a knife at [Xiao Wei].
1:28:44|1:28:49|[Du Yu] said that [Shen Mo], who used to be good at fighting, is now beaten by Yuan Pengjun and can't stand up.
1:29:18|1:29:34|[Shen Mo] confirmed that Yuan Pengjun was indeed the number one assassin in Japan. Not only did he block his attacks, but he also swiftly knocked him to the ground. It turns out that he had been pretending to be weak all along, trying to extract information that Yuan Pengjun was the number one assassin in Japan.
1:29:34|1:29:49|[Shen Mo] at this moment had no hesitation, as if possessed by a war god, he countered all of Yuan Pengjun's moves one by one. In the end, he kicked him to the ground. This time, [Shen Mo] clearly had the upper hand in the fight, expressing his anger in Japanese language.
1:29:50|1:30:0|[Ma Xiaoli] and others were self-rescuing in the house. At this moment, Yuan Pengjun opened the door and walked in. Ma Xiaoli quickly stepped forward and punched Yuan Pengjun, making him kneel on the ground. Then she hysterically shouted:
1:30:17|1:30:30|Shen Mo and Ma Xiaoli helped each other leave, while A Lian shouted unwillingly from behind. Outside the door, Yao Zong rode a tricycle with his little brothers towards them, and the old men and women who staged accidents targeted them again.
1:30:49|1:30:57|Mr. Yao slammed on the brakes in a hurry, but unexpectedly the old man took a few steps and lay down in front of the car. Now Mr. Yao quickly reversed the car.
1:31:10|1:31:26|Yao Zong and others arrived at the clinic and found it in a mess. The henchman said, "Yao Zong noticed Yuan Pengjun sitting at the door and kicked him."
1:31:34|1:31:43|The sound of the alarm bell rang at this moment, leaving Yao and others stunned, while Jia and others who were still trapped in the clinic burst into laughter joyfully.
1:31:46|1:31:59|The hotel owner who ran away before returned to his small shop with luggage. His wife put down the luggage and looked around. She saw a bankbook on the front desk and quickly called her husband over to look at it.
1:32:59|1:33:11|Faced with Ma Xiaoli's confession, Shen Mo could only pretend to be dumbfounded. Ma Xiaoli also realized and said:
1:33:23|1:33:28|[Ma Xiaoli] slowly closes the door, and the two of them share a smile through the crack in the door.
1:33:33|1:33:58|[Shen Mo] thought about what [Ma Xiaoli] had said, feeling fortunate in his heart. Little did he know that those words were from the bottom of [Ma Xiaoli]'s heart. [Shen Mo]'s expression gradually became heavy, and he turned and left [Ma Xiaoli]'s place. As he walked, he took off the waiter's clothes, revealing a suit underneath. He also put on a huge backpack halfway, slowly disappearing into the corridor. [Ma Xiaoli] walked into the sisters' room feeling lost. Qi Qi saw her and exclaimed excitedly:
1:34:21|1:34:43|She recalled the time when she left her pen at the bank while filling out a remittance form, and [Shen Mo] accidentally picked up her pen because his own pen couldn't write. It turned out that the two had already met. Shortly after, the mysterious wealthy businessman [He Dachang], who died from a fall, was reported in the news as having died from taking a selfie with his phone.
1:34:45|1:34:53|The lovebirds Du Yu and Xiao Wei, intending to go abroad, visited an immigration company for consultation.
1:35:15|1:35:22|The two of them exchanged a smile in good spirits, while [Shen Mo], disguised as a professional, walked slowly in the hallway.
1:35:28|1:35:52|He selected the country for [Du Yu] and the other person, thinking that this would be the last thing he could do for him. Then he took off his casual glasses and beard, and spat out the round beads that changed his facial shape from his mouth. He casually threw these things into the nearby trash can, and then without hesitation, he slowly opened the door to the top floor.
1:36:13|1:36:25|In the midst of silence, [Shen Mo] strides firmly towards the edge of the top floor, with the city lights casting an illusory glow. Beneath his feet lies a bustling road, and one more step forward will lead him into the abyss.
1:36:25|1:36:34|At this moment, Ma Xiaoli's phone rang. She glanced down at the phone on the ground but didn't answer. On the other end of the line, Ma Xiaoli complained:
