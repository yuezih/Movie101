0:0:38|0:0:41|On a remote country road, a bus rushes past.
0:0:45|0:1:0|Please don't hesitate to like, subscribe, share, and support the "Mingjing" and "Diandian" programs.
0:1:22|0:1:43|Accompanied by cheerful music, a bus full of girls who came from the city to work passes through a tunnel. The road, lined with rice fields on both sides, stretches towards the countryside, where the buildings in the distance gradually transition from tall buildings in the city to unique rural tiled houses. The road in the village becomes increasingly bumpy.
0:2:20|0:2:28|[Song Daxiong] put down his phone and turned to look at the girls who were still immersed in the excitement, loudly introducing them.
0:2:40|0:2:55|[Sung Daxiong] finished speaking, swaying happily in his seat to the music. His friend who had asked the question before immediately deflated upon hearing it, expressionless as he leaned heavily against the seat back. The bus wound around the mountain road, passing by patches of woods and ponds.
0:3:35|0:3:54|Accompanied by the girls' laughter, the bus was getting closer to the destination. It didn't take long for it to be disrupted, as the bus suddenly braked and a girl holding a silver rod lost her grip, spilling out a lot of water. The culprit of all this was a wooden barrel leisurely carried by a cow, slowly passing in front of the bus.
0:4:31|0:4:49|After a long time, the bus finally arrived at the destination, swiftly passing through the village entrance with a banner hanging above it. The banner read "Wushan Chao Civilization Stone Flower Wine Fragrance". Driving further in, as the bus approached, the children playing at the village entrance spontaneously lined up into two rows to make way for the bus, then playfully chased after the departing bus.
0:4:52|0:5:8|After a long journey, the group finally arrived at the village. The girls carried their suitcases and walked unsteadily to the open space in the village. By now, many villagers had gathered there, each one scrutinizing and sizing up these fashionable girls who had come from the city.
0:5:8|0:5:14|The girls are wearing tight jeans and cropped tops, completely different from the village women in loose shirts.
0:5:34|0:5:40|The girls who were shouting to go to the bathroom were stunned by [Song Daxiong] in a chrome jacket, and they all walked back.
0:6:9|0:6:25|In the village committee, a middle-aged man with a bushy beard is carefully weighing the neatly arranged tea leaves on the table. He picks up a pinch of tea leaves, puts them in his mouth, and savors them carefully. As he picks up the kettle to prepare a cup of hot tea, a middle-aged man wearing glasses rushes in anxiously.
0:6:31|0:6:35|The village chief was startled, hot boiling water spilled on his hand, and the teacup fell to the ground.
0:6:51|0:7:4|On the vast edge of Changyuan, [Song Daxiong] on the co-driver's seat of the bus was writing the words "sprout tea" on a blackboard. He was surrounded by curious villagers and city girls who came to attend the training.
0:8:1|0:8:19|The girls dispersed in excitement, rushing to open the dormitory door. They chattered away, disrupting the dormitory and noisily assigning beds. The girl with the fish tank almost got into an argument with the girl holding a cat. The originally plain room was quickly decorated with fashionable posters and small animals by the girls, creating a warm atmosphere.
0:8:20|0:8:28|The one leading them in, [Luo Minying], stood at the door awkwardly stirring the clothes with his hands, watching their smooth movements in a daze.
0:8:40|0:8:53|Luo Mingying was stunned by this question, and the noisy girls instantly quieted down, turning their heads to look at [Zhang Lilei] who asked the question. [Zhang Lilei] also didn't expect this outcome, innocently pouted and didn't speak again.
0:8:53|0:9:3|After the girls finished packing up, they returned to the previous open space and lined up to receive the tea house and apron from Luo Mingying and [Song Daxiong].
0:9:15|0:9:29|The girls followed the villagers and [Song Daxiong] to the tea plantation. The road in the tea plantation was lined with flags. On a high platform, a boy and a girl in rattan outfits were performing tea art at a table with a stove.
0:9:29|0:9:37|High toss, turn around, catch the pot, bend down, pour water, a copper pot with a spout about one meter long in their hands seems to come to life.
0:9:38|0:9:56|As their movements danced, the tea flowed down with their actions, but landed steadily into the cups. The audience below widened their eyes, amazed by their superb skills. After the tea performance, [Song Daxiong] and his sister Xiaojuan walked up to the stage with their mother holding a tray.
0:9:56|0:10:8|The tray was covered with a piece of cloth, making it impossible to see what was inside. As they walked onto the stage, [Zhang Lilei] slowly uncovered the cloth. Inside, there was a set of glass tea ware and a jar full of tea leaves.
0:10:18|0:10:44|After Luo Mingying finished explaining, the girls from the town who were gathered around him whispered to each other, all with smiles on their faces, craning their necks to look towards the stage.
0:10:46|0:11:1|On stage, [Zhang Lilei] carefully poured the boiling water he had just boiled into the teapot with the tea leaves in it. The soft tea leaves seemed to come to life as the boiling water was poured in, dancing in the teapot as if they had a life of their own, with each leaf standing upright without falling over.
0:11:2|0:11:18|[Sung Daxiong] covered the teapot, poured the tea into the cup beside him, raised the tea cup high towards the nearby stone tablet, and then respectfully walked to the table with the incense burner. He held the tea cup up to his forehead, bowed deeply towards the stone tablet.
0:11:20|0:11:30|The audience below the stage looked curiously at his mysterious ritual. He set down the teacup, clasped his hands together, and bowed reverently towards the stone tablet. Only then did the ritual officially come to an end.
0:13:14|0:13:17|The manager [Zhang Lilei] smoothly slid along the tender shoots of the tea tree.
0:13:41|0:13:49|[张丽蕾] couldn't help but sniff the fresh scent of the tea tree. [骆明英] followed her lead and picked a tender shoot to introduce to the girls.
0:14:10|0:14:25|[Lu Mingying] had just finished introducing the girls, and they immediately started working vigorously. They danced and ran, dispersing like a group of butterflies in the vast tea plantation, as if they had inexhaustible energy. The fatigue from the morning's journey from the city had all disappeared.
0:14:28|0:14:42|On the other side of the field, there were five or six little boys squatting on the terraced fields like little monkeys, curiously staring at the women workers who came from the city, even singing some vulgar nursery rhymes. The girls, however, paid no attention, waving their hands to drive away the mischievous boys.
0:14:42|0:14:55|Compared to the skilled tea-picking movements of [Luo Mingying], the girls are still somewhat inexperienced, with some even picking chaotically without care. They clumsily imitate the proper technique, with some even making phone calls while picking tea.
0:15:23|0:15:31|A pair of delicate and smooth hands fluttering on the tea tree, the skilled [Zhang Lilei] picking tea is extremely beautiful, just like playing the piano.
0:15:31|0:15:43|Other girls were a bit slow, some didn't know what kind of tea to pick and just picked randomly, while others picked one and carefully compared it in front of them. But everyone was enthusiastically doing their work.
0:15:44|0:15:59|Outside the tea plantation, [Song Daxiong] is looking at [Zhang Lilei], who had just led the girls to sign the contract. [Zhang Lilei] notices his gaze, looks up at him, and [Song Daxiong] immediately smiles at him. However, [Zhang Lilei] does not appreciate it, she lowers her head expressionlessly and continues picking tea leaves.
0:15:59|0:16:12|On the side, Lu Mingying noticed everything and looked thoughtfully at [Zhang Lilei]. With the moon shining brightly, after a long day of work, the girls finally returned to the dormitory, one by one collapsing on their beds, complaining.
0:17:36|0:17:48|The scene shifts, hot water gushes from the shower head in the bathroom, a girl slowly takes off her stockings, dragging her weary body towards the shower room, occasionally humming a few lines of a song as she moves.
0:18:24|0:18:33|The girls in the jade room chatted and laughed, but looking out the window, there were a few unfriendly faces, craning their necks to peer inside the scene in the jade room.
0:18:35|0:19:0|The village chief, holding a flashlight, passed by and discovered the group of boys peeking from the trees. He looked at them with some confusion, then shouted at them. Following their direction, the village chief found himself facing the window of the women's bathhouse, feeling a bit embarrassed. He shone the flashlight at the two boys still peeking in the tree.
0:19:8|0:19:28|After the child climbed down from the tree, the village chief covered his eyes and ran away. The scene shifted, and Zhang Lilei handed a cloth bundle to his mother, "Mom, this is the first batch of sprouting tea this year, I've roasted it for you." Please accept it. Zhang Lilei's mother took out an empty tea canister from the depths of the cabinet, solemnly accepted the cloth bundle, placed the tea leaves to her nose, and carefully savored the hard-earned fragrance.
0:19:28|0:19:35|After pinching another handful of tea leaves and grinding them finely in her hand, [Zhang Lilei] poured the tea leaves into the pot only after confirming everything was in order.
0:21:42|0:22:3|Luo Mingying followed behind [Song Daxiong], and after a while, he continued speaking. Seeing that [Song Daxiong] didn't say anything further, Luo Mingying continued to ask. [Song Daxiong] turned his head to look at Luo Mingying, and the two of them walked forward in silence, quietly pushing open the wooden door of the venue and slowly making their way to their destination.
0:22:3|0:22:9|The next day, at dawn, all the female workers who had said they were quitting last night were ready and waiting, not one missing, in the tea garden.
0:22:37|0:22:43|[Zhang Lilei] finished the fight with her friend before turning around to ask Xiao Juan, who was standing next to Luo Mingying, picking tea leaves.
0:22:51|0:23:1|[Zhang Lilei] was also startled and jumped into the aisle all of a sudden. As the girls panicked and fled in all directions, the village chief arrived at the tea garden with the photographer. Next to him, [Song Daxiong] introduced.
0:24:32|0:24:38|Late at night, the [Song family] watched a clip of journalist interviewing [Zhang Lilei] in the tea garden during the day.
0:25:0|0:25:15|Song Daxiong paid no attention to the quarrel between his mother and sister, but stared straight at Zhang Lilei talking confidently on the TV. In the women's bathhouse at this moment, a girl glanced at the profound Lady, smirked, and winked at the girl next to her.
0:25:32|0:25:44|The girls, in the midst of their playfulness, did not notice the commotion outside the window. The sound of boys struggling to climb trees was particularly loud in the night. As the night grew deeper, at [Song Daxiong]'s home, the Song family of three discussed the female workers.
0:25:59|0:26:3|Song Mu looked at their hurried figures and then turned to Zhang Lilei.
0:26:4|0:26:18|In the office of the tea factory, [Song Daxiong] and the village chief solemnly scrutinize the two little boys standing in front of them, heads down and silent. The two boys stand before [Song Daxiong] and the village chief, heads lowered, eyes cast down, with torn collars and pants.
0:27:4|0:27:10|[Sung Daxiong] anxiously pinched his temples, burying his face in his hands, trying to come up with a solution.
0:27:24|0:27:39|The two little boys didn't move, but instead looked towards [Song Daxiong]. [Song Daxiong] stood up and escorted them out of the office, standing behind them giving instructions. Just a few steps out of the room, the two little boys ran into the girls who had just finished washing up.
0:27:39|0:27:46|They stopped in their tracks as soon as they saw the girls, staring blankly at their backs as the girls murmured softly.
0:27:49|0:27:55|[Songsong] also walked out of the office and came to the village chief helplessly.
0:28:20|0:28:28|Early the next morning, Zhang Lilei was busy building a wall outside the bathroom. The girls who came to wash up were peeking from under the steps.
0:28:39|0:28:43|After everything was settled, the girls arrived at the tea garden and began a day of work.
0:28:44|0:28:54|Luo Mingying, who used to arrive the earliest, was late this time. She was no longer dressed in a plain style with a long coat and pants, but instead wore a fashionable tight skirt with a shirt.
0:29:12|0:29:23|Lu Mingying, feeling a bit embarrassed by the praise, tugged at the hem of his shirt and smiled as he picked up the tea leaves. [Zhang Lilei] quickly walked over to [Zhang Lilei]'s side with a friendly gesture.
0:30:16|0:30:30|[Zhang Lilei] blushed slightly when she heard the praise, tugging at the hem of her shirt. She smiled as she picked up the tea leaves, prompting Youqing to quickly walk over to [Zhang Lilei]. Luo Mingying rolled up her sleeves and moved the tea basket to a different spot, while Lei Youda and the others continued to pick tea on their own.
0:30:33|0:30:55|A while later, [Zhang Lilei] glanced at the female workers around her, quickly tucking the hem of her shirt into her skirt before continuing to work. Shortly after, she carried a basket to an empty corner, looked around to confirm it was safe, and then pulled out the clothes she had prepared from her skirt before returning to the tea-picking team.
0:30:55|0:31:0|At sunset, when it was time to harvest the tea leaves, Zhang Lilei lit a fire to burn the pile of tea leaves on the ground.
0:31:50|0:31:56|The girls behind all squatted down to inspect the leaves, and the girl at the end struggled to support her waist as she squatted down.
0:33:3|0:33:15|The girl from the countryside found that [Song Daxiong] was standing right behind her. She was so scared that she ran away without even taking the stele. Accidentally, a little cat popped out from the knocked-over stele. The girl had to go back, pick up the stele, and leave.
0:33:15|0:33:28|As the sun rises, the tea plantation welcomes a new day. The girls gather on the rooftop in twos and threes to wash clothes. [Zhang Lilei] is holding clean clothes ready to hang them out to dry, while the old lady next to her looks at the underwear in her hands.
0:33:31|0:33:37|[Zhang Lilei] finished speaking, picked up the washbasin, and walked towards an empty space. The older sister behind quickly stepped forward to strike up a conversation.
0:33:51|0:34:14|The elder sister looked curiously in the direction of [Zhang Lilei]. Soon, [Zhang Lilei] walked towards the elder sister holding a jar of face mask. After the elder sister thanked her, she took the face mask and walked away with a washbasin. [Zhang Lilei] smiled lightly and continued to hang up her clean clothes.
0:34:14|0:34:19|Xiaojuan hurried over with heavy steps, breaking the morning tranquility.
0:34:26|0:34:44|[Zhang Lilei] looked down at Xiao Juan for a long time without coming back to her senses, furrowing her brows in confusion. Soon, the female workers gathered outside the tea garden, with Song Daxiong's daughter, Nü Jia, and Luo Mingying standing in front of them holding the contract, the two sides looking at each other.
0:35:30|0:35:38|[Sung Daxiong]'s mother finished speaking and turned to leave. Xiao Juan and Luo Mingying quickly caught up, leaving [Sung Daxiong] and the girls to continue confronting each other.
0:35:53|0:36:22|Of course, there is another way. You can negotiate with them and offer some overtime pay. [Zhang Lilei] didn't respond, silently turned and left. If they were willing, they should have been busy picking tea leaves during the harvest season. However, the tea garden was empty at this moment. It was the first time it had been so quiet since the girls arrived. Used to the hustle and bustle of the past, it felt a bit strange at this moment. In the courtyard of [Zhang Lilei]'s house, his mother was feeding the pigs while pulling grass.
0:36:35|0:36:38|Xiao Juan and Luo Mingying smiled at each other.
0:36:38|0:36:56|At the same time, in the office, [Song Daxiong] sat in front of the computer, skillfully typing on the keyboard. In front of the keyboard lay an open labor contract. He clumsily operated the computer, taking a long time to find the labor law that those girls had mentioned. With his left hand supporting his chin, he leaned on the desk and pondered.
0:36:56|0:37:9|Intently staring at the computer screen. Meanwhile, at the elder sister's home who received the face mask from [Zhang Lilei] in the morning, the elder sister is applying the face mask in front of the mirror. After she finishes speaking, she turns around and leaves. The elder sister suddenly turns around, glaring at her disappearing figure.
0:37:10|0:37:21|In the early morning sun, in the women's dormitory, Ling Youqin had already changed into casual clothes and lazily leaned on the bed. [Zhang Lilei], on the other hand, was all dressed up and ready to go, with a backpack on her back, walking up to her.
0:37:28|0:37:32|[Zhang Lilei] had to go out alone. On the village road, the uncle on the motorcycle took care of her.
0:37:37|0:37:45|Having finished eating, on both sides of the small road, groups of three to five villagers basking in the sun gathered. [Zhang Lilei] stopped in front of a fruit stall.
0:38:23|0:38:39|[Zhang Lilei] found the shallow stream along the winding path, the clear and tranquil water flowing over smooth pebbles, draped in a silk-like sunlight flowing towards the distance, disappearing into the winding mountain cave. She wore headphones, fluttering like a butterfly in the peaceful valley.
0:38:40|0:38:53|With a handful of dogtail grass in hand, [Zhang Lilei] moves up and down occasionally to the sound of music. In the picturesque landscape, besides [Zhang Lilei], there are no other visitors. A water buffalo stands in the stream, slowly chewing on grass with its head lowered.
0:38:53|0:39:1|In the painting "Four Seasons of Dao Yu", there is a resemblance to the scene where [Zhang Lilei] gently brushes the water buffalo's nose with a tuft of dog tail grass in her hand.
0:39:2|0:39:21|The gentle water buffalo is not angry, just quietly allowing itself to be manipulated. Unlike the water buffalo, the small crab in the crevice is not as easy-going. When [Zhang Lilei] picked it up, it vigorously waved its small pincers, ready to fight at any moment. Seeing this, [Zhang Lilei] had no choice but to give up and quickly put the small crab back in its place.
0:39:21|0:39:25|Perhaps due to spending too much time in the city, [Zhang Lilei] is full of curiosity about nature.
0:39:26|0:39:33|Even the small stones by the river, he can play with for a long time, everything around him is so novel.
0:39:33|0:39:51|Rather than a visit to the tea trees, this trip for [Zhang Lilei] seemed more like an outing. He had been playing and fooling around all the way, and finally saw the winding stone steps in the dense grove not far away. Excitedly, [Zhang Lilei] glanced at the layered steps and seized the opportunity to bounce up.
0:39:51|0:40:4|At the end of the stairs is a narrow corridor. Walking along the corridor, a whole new world awaits inside. Unlike the cramped corridor just now, stepping over the last stone step into the temple, everything suddenly becomes clear and spacious.
0:40:4|0:40:25|In the distance, the towering spires reaching into the clouds echo the solemn and majestic temples. A pool of water cascades down from the slope, resembling a small waterfall. In the pavilion at the end of the stone bridge, a abbot is deep in meditation. Standing beside him is a young novice monk, blending harmoniously with the serene and elegant surroundings.
0:40:25|0:40:29|The sound of the temple bell rang out, clear and crisp, lingering in the air.
0:40:33|0:40:40|[Zhang Lilei] heard the long bell sound, smiled playfully, and walked along the moss-covered water bridge to the two monks at the end of the corridor.
0:41:26|0:41:46|The old monk spread out a bamboo curtain filled with scriptures on the table. Then, various tea utensils were neatly arranged in different categories. Dozens of utensils such as tea stoves, tea stoves, and tea grinders were all available. The tea set was well maintained, and the clay teapot revealed a beautiful patina. Paired with its simple and elegant design, it appeared pure and elegant.
0:41:46|0:41:52|Even the water for making tea is carefully prepared. [Zhang Lilei] carried a wooden bucket and walked towards the riverbank on the other side of the stone bridge.
0:41:53|0:42:14|In the style of Su Shi's poetry, fire and water still need to be spewed out like fire, with a light-hearted spirit of taking the soul-dangling stone. A piece of charcoal is lit on the teapot, and the swirling smoke soon disperses. The old monk places the tea axe filled with mountain spring water on the tea stove, picks up a square handkerchief from the side and respectfully touches his hand, before slowly lifting the boiling tea axe.
0:42:16|0:42:30|The water was poured into the teacup from top to bottom, before it cooled down, the old monk immediately picked up the tea chopsticks and poured out the hot water in the teacup. His movements were quick but methodical, Zhang Lilei watched with fascination, nodding in admiration.
0:42:30|0:42:41|The old monk put down the tea chopsticks, picked up the tea axe, and slowly poured the hot water into the teapot placed in the tea pool. The hot water quickly soaked the teapot, and the overflowing tea water rolled in the tea pool.
0:42:43|0:42:57|He poured out the excess hot water from the pot with a flick of his sleeve, then swirled the tea in the fairness cup. By heating the fairness cup with hot water, he cleared out the boiling water in the cup, this is the process of warming the cup. With everything ready, the tea brewing officially began.
0:42:58|0:43:14|The old monk placed the teapot aside, picked up a clay tea canister with his left hand, and held a slender wooden tea spoon with his right hand. In a swift motion, the tea spoon was filled with excellent orange tea leaves. Accompanied by a long bell chime, the delicate curled tea leaves were also sent into the teapot.
0:43:14|0:43:27|The old monk raised the tea axe high, and the mountain spring water turned into a thin stream, slowly flowing into the pot. In the quiet room, a faint tea fragrance filled the air, he placed the gourd-like tea leaves on the fairness cup, and slowly poured tea for [Zhang Lilei].
0:44:3|0:44:21|[Zhang Lilei] stopped the action of drinking tea. This time, following the abbot's method, he did not rush to drink the tea, but instead placed the teacup at the tip of his nose, carefully savoring it. After feeling the rich and mellow fragrance of the tea leaves, he slowly brought the tea to his mouth. Only after he finished drinking did the abbot pour out a second cup of tea.
0:44:21|0:44:27|Standing beside, the young monk handed the teacup to [Zhang Lilei], who tried the tea again following the tea-tasting method.
0:44:56|0:45:14|The melodious sound of the bell rang from afar, and two monks escorted the finished [Zhang Lilei] out of the temple. [Zhang Lilei] smiled as she descended the stone steps. Just as she reached the corner of the stone slab, she turned to wave goodbye to the two monks, but they had already disappeared from sight, leaving only the gentle breeze brushing the branches on the stone walls on both sides.
0:45:14|0:45:17|[Zhang Lilei] sighed with a smile and set off on the road back to the village.
0:45:19|0:45:35|[Zhang Lilei] followed his memory back along the path he had taken earlier. It was already late in the day, and he focused on hurrying along, no longer as distracted as before. Following the directions given by the villagers in the morning, he followed the stream downstream and arrived at a crossroads, somewhat unsteadily.
0:45:35|0:45:46|The stream here is divided into three sections, a situation that Zhang Lilei did not encounter when she came. She looked around the surrounding mountains and forests with some confusion, then decisively chose the path ahead without much hesitation.
0:45:50|0:46:10|The setting sun was setting in the west, with only sporadic rays of the setting sun shining on the earth. [Zhang Lilei] returned to the three-way intersection. His steps were a bit hurried, and his demeanor was not as confident as before. He anxiously observed the road conditions at the intersection and hesitantly stepped onto the small path to the upper left.
0:46:10|0:46:15|The distant roar of a wild beast made him quicken his pace, running hurriedly forward.
0:46:17|0:46:35|After walking on the rocky road for a day, his steps became a bit unsteady. He followed the water flow forward, only to find himself getting further away from the expected route. The howls of wild beasts grew louder, and [Zhang Lilei] quickened his pace. The water source slowly disappeared, and he stood on a large rock without error to observe the road conditions.
0:46:35|0:46:44|Unfortunately, there was nothing here except for overgrown weeds. [Zhang Lilei] anxiously held his head, trying to find the path he had taken among the countless roads around him.
0:46:45|0:47:5|He dashed around like a headless fly, randomly choosing a path and running off. As the sky grew darker, [Zhang Lilei] eventually futilely returned to the three-way intersection, feeling the fear of being lost creeping up on him. He looked towards the distant towering mountains and, in a panic, grabbed his bag and briskly ran up the mountain.
0:47:35|0:47:51|At the same time, in the Song family courtyard, all the men in the village gathered on motorcycles, with dozens of motorcycles turning on their headlights, illuminating the night as bright as day. The grand motorcycle convoy set off one by one in order, embarking on the journey to find Zhang Lilei.
0:47:54|0:48:9|The motorcycle team moved along the winding village road in an orderly manner, with two bikes side by side. The bright headlights were like a surging spring tide, grandly embarking on the path to find someone. They illuminated the quiet night, as well as the way home for [Zhang Lilei].
0:48:14|0:48:30|Dozens of motorcycles formed many dancing dragons, the low roar echoing in the quiet village, the convoy passing through the winding paths in an orderly manner. Crossing the undulating mountain roads, carefully searching for the figure of [Zhang Lilei] in the dense mountain forests.
0:48:30|0:48:47|Although it was summer, the mountain forest was still a bit cold at night, but the simple villagers didn't mind. At the foot of the mountain, the convoy could no longer drive up. They gathered around [Song Daxiong], waiting for his instructions. [Song Daxiong] had a large flashlight hanging from his waist.
0:48:47|0:48:54|He struggled to take out his phone and dialed Zhang Lilei's number.
0:49:6|0:49:33|The cheers from the crowd lifted [Zhang Lilei]'s spirits, her expression gradually softened, no longer as flustered as before, gradually relaxing. [Song Daxiong] comforted [Zhang Lilei] while searching in the mountains.
0:50:10|0:50:13|[Zhang Lilei] looks at [Song Daxiong].
0:50:48|0:51:9|[Mrs. Song] took out an empty tea canister, turned around and continued to search in the cabinet. She pinched a few buds of tea and put them into the canister, and finally just poured them all in.
0:51:14|0:51:25|[Jenny] then took the flashlight, while [Mrs. Song] watched her leave the room. She stood at the doorway holding a tea canister, constantly looking around with worry and sorrow written in her eyes.
0:51:25|0:51:35|The night was deep, [Xiao Juan] walked alone on the desolate path, her slender body showing no sign of fear. She arrived at a house with a tea canister in her arms and knocked on the door forcefully.
0:51:37|0:52:1|However, no one opened the door, and he went from house to house with an empty can, inquiring. As each big door opened, the empty teahouse gradually filled with tea from different households, carrying the simple goodwill of the villagers and the unique blessings of the people. The tea, along with the blessings, was sent out. These teas had no distinction of high or low, perhaps the tea had value, but the villagers' blessings were priceless.
0:52:6|0:52:34|When Xiao Juan pushed open the dormitory door with a tea canister filled with concern, [Zhang Lilei] was surrounded by the girls who were comforting her. Everyone looked towards Xiao Juan, "Lilei, this is Baijia tea. My mom said if you drink this tea, the cold in your body will be gone, and you won't get sick." [Zhang Lilei] looked at Xiao Juan in confusion, tears gradually filling her eyes. Seeing her lack of response, Xiao Juan took the initiative to hand her the tea canister.
0:52:35|0:52:53|The night of Xuan Xiao finally passed, and the next day dawned. In the misty morning, Zhang Lilei followed a small path to the tea garden. The garden was shrouded in clouds and mist, appearing as if in a mysterious fairyland. However, Zhang Lilei suddenly stopped in his tracks.
0:53:6|0:53:13|[Song Daxiong] listened and smiled before standing for a long time before leaving. As night fell, the girls gathered around the computer to discuss.
0:53:30|0:53:36|When everyone was amused by the guy on the computer, [Song Daxiong] and [Zhang Lilei] were whispering to each other in a quiet corner.
0:53:52|0:54:2|[Zhang Lilei] nodded thoughtfully after listening, the next morning in the dim light, [Song Daxiong] stood angrily in front of the bathroom, a big hole suddenly appeared on the wall.
0:54:8|0:54:11|[Sung Daxiong] stops [Zhang Lilei] from leaving.
0:54:26|0:54:45|[Song Daxiong] nodded awkwardly at Jing Le. Zhang Lilei turned around and looked at [Song Daxiong]. [Song Daxiong] sighed with a bitter smile. Seeing [Song Daxiong]'s reaction, Zhang Lilei laughed and ran away.
0:54:45|0:55:0|In the afternoon, as the ladies finished their day's work and inspected the day's results at the inspection point, a luxurious car suddenly drove into the tea factory with the roar of an engine.
0:55:13|0:55:17|In the curious gazes of everyone, [Zhang Lilei] lowered her head and slowly raised her hand.
0:55:19|0:56:16|We saw online that there is a type of tea called "Daughter Fragrance," right? Zhang Lilei nodded. The young man in a suit and the foreign boss explained that the girl in front of them is the one who sells tea online. The foreign boss immediately greeted Zhang Lilei, who responded gracefully. In the dormitory, Zhang Lilei slowly took off her solemn clothes, and her friend helped her put on a traditional off-the-shoulder qipao with intricate clasps. Seeing Zhang Lilei so calm, her friend was a bit worried. "Are you sure you can do this?" "No problem. I've seen the world. If I can help [Song Daxiong] sell tea successfully once, it would be a way to repay him." Shortly after, the elegantly made-up Zhang Lilei walked into the meeting room. She gracefully passed by the tea factory workers on both sides and the foreign businessmen who came to buy tea, and slowly sat down at the tea table. All eyes were on her as she smiled slightly and reached for the tea cup displayed on the table.
0:56:19|0:56:37|Zhang Lilei's hand, however, seemed to have a mind of its own, as the teacup wobbled uncontrollably in her grasp. Unfazed, Zhang Lilei steadied herself, arranged the teacup neatly, and attempted to pick up the teaspoon. No matter how hard she tried, the teaspoon remained stuck. Frowning slightly, she quickened her movements.
0:56:39|0:56:56|He made a clever move, taking out the tea spoon but leaving other tea utensils scattered on the table. He tidied up the messy table, but then put the tea spoon filled with tea leaves into the public cup. The chaotic order made everyone look at [Zhang Lilei] nervously.
0:56:56|0:57:7|[Zhang Lilei] continued with trembling hands, but the more flustered he became, the more chaotic his movements were. He poured the tea leaves from the fairness cup into the tea bowl, glanced at the stunned crowd, and took a deep breath.
0:57:13|0:57:33|The resigned big teapot was quickly delivered. Despite some cracks and tea stains faintly visible on the teapot due to long-term use, [Zhang Lilei] handled it with ease. She placed the teapot on the table, pinched a handful of Baijia tea leaves into the pot. The boiling water was poured directly into the pot, and she nodded satisfactorily as she sat down.
0:58:38|0:58:49|In the eyes of her applauding friends, tears welled up. Everyone was amused by her, and [Zhang Lilei] stood up and walked towards the crowd.
0:58:56|0:59:20|[Zhang Lilei] handed the tea cup to the foreign businessman next to her. The whole village looked at her, waiting for the final judgment. After taking a sip, she nodded and kept praising the rich and fragrant tea from her daughter's hometown. Hearing this praise, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.
0:59:20|0:59:22|Night falls, [Song Daxiong] grips the motorcycle carrying [Zhang Lilei].
1:0:14|1:0:21|Oh, [Zhang Lilei] stared straight at the lake and hesitantly spoke.
1:0:27|1:0:31|[Sung Daxiong] kept touching his pants leg and continued speaking.
1:0:58|1:1:0|She shed a tear as she left.
1:1:12|1:1:26|[Zhang Lilei] scrutinized [Song Daxiong] with her eyes. [Song Daxiong] shyly turned his head, and [Zhang Lilei] smiled at his reaction. Under the bright moonlight, [Zhang Lilei] took off her clothes, like a fairy bathing in the Heavenly Pool in a story.
1:2:29|1:2:36|[Zhang Lilei] suddenly sneezed, and [Song Daxiong] turned around with concern, quickly covering his eyes when he saw her smooth back.
1:2:37|1:2:47|After Zhang Lilei finished writing, Song Daxiong escorted him back to the dormitory entrance. Song Daxiong couldn't bear to look at Zhang Lilei.
1:3:20|1:3:25|Tea workers and various tea-making machines appeared in front of the two in the courtyard.
1:3:56|1:4:2|Wei Jiafeng's tea is tumbling in the machine, going through a series of processes, and ultimately transforming into tea.
1:4:4|1:4:9|[Sung Daxiong] leads [Zhang Lilei] as they continue to walk towards the front of the factory building.
1:4:44|1:4:49|[Sung Daxiong] walked towards the innermost room, looking at the tea-making tools inside with a smile.
1:4:51|1:5:0|He confidently lit the stove, the blazing fire heating up the tea pot. With everything prepared, he stood up and the tea roasting officially began.
1:5:15|1:5:33|[Sung Daxiong]'s rough hands kept stirring the tea leaves in the pan, the dried tea leaves in his hands tumbling and gradually taking shape, the faint fragrance of tea permeating the air. [Zhang Lilei] stood aside observing his skilled movements, hesitated for a while, and finally placed her hand on [Sung Daxiong]'s arm.
1:5:33|1:5:42|[Song Daxiong] was taken aback by his actions and looked nervously at the shy-faced [Zhang Lilei]. Guided by [Zhang Lilei], their hands slowly intertwined.
1:5:43|1:5:58|[Song Daxiong] stood there dumbfounded, allowing himself to instinctively follow [Zhang Lilei]'s movements. [Zhang Lilei] raised her hand and gently approached [Song Daxiong]'s lips. In the quiet night, their hearts drew closer and closer, with warm lips already touching.
1:5:58|1:6:2|[Sung Daxiong] quietly reached out his arm and pulled [Zhang Lilei] into his embrace.
1:6:3|1:6:17|They were passionately kissing in the night, instinctively wanting to hold the person in front of them, without noticing when Luo Mingying appeared at the door. [Song Daxiong] suddenly looked up and saw Luo Mingying at the door.
1:6:24|1:6:32|Luo Mingying finished speaking and turned to leave, leaving the room in an awkward silence, with only the tea leaves in the teapot emitting a faint fragrance that no one paid attention to.
1:6:34|1:6:41|After a chaotic night, in the courtyard of the Song family, Zhang Lilei's mother looked at the girls picking tea in the distance.
1:6:47|1:7:2|After Mrs. Song finished speaking, Xiao Kou sipped her tea. Song Daxiong, who was watering the vegetables, turned his head upon hearing this and looked at the girl in the tea garden behind him, a happy smile appearing on his simple and honest face. In the tea garden, the girls were also discussing their own topics, and Lian Youqing ran towards Zhang Lilei.
1:7:43|1:8:0|[Lian Youqing] looked at the two people playing dumb riddles with some confusion. Without explaining to him, [Zhang Lilei] took the stele and walked towards Luo Mingying. [Lian Youqing] shrugged in confusion and didn't ask further. Luo Mingying saw [Zhang Lilei] approaching, turned around, and took her to a secluded place where he hesitated before slowly speaking.
1:9:2|1:9:18|Luo Mingying finished speaking, turned around and walked away without giving Zhang Lilei time to explain. As soon as she turned around, she raised her hand to wipe away the tears from the corner of her eyes, quickened her pace, wanting to escape this heartbreaking place as soon as possible. Zhang Lilei looked at her guiltily, then slowly lowered her head and sighed as she watched her stubborn figure walk away.
1:9:22|1:9:39|As the sun sets, the girls line up and walk out of the tea garden. [Song Daxiong] is waiting at the gate for a long time. He smiles and waves to the girls, but his eyes are fixed on [Zhang Lilei] standing next to Ling Youqin. However, when [Zhang Lilei] passes by [Song Daxiong], she lowers her head and remains silent, even hiding behind Ling Youqin.
1:9:39|1:9:41|[Son Daxiong] looked on in disappointment, stunned for a long time.
1:9:47|1:9:59|In the evening, the girls who had been busy all day gathered on the rooftop in groups of three or four, chatting and laughing. [Song Daxiong] thoughtfully brewed tea for them and delivered it one by one. "Thank you, Daxiong ge, thank you, Daxiong ge."
1:10:7|1:10:20|The girls all thanked [Song Daxiong] for his kindness, but when the tea was brought to [Zhang Lilei], she just coldly took the cup without saying a word. [Song Daxiong] could no longer maintain his smile, and he walked away disappointedly with the tray.
1:10:20|1:10:38|The carefree Ling Qin also sensed something amiss, looking at [Zhang Lilei] with confusion. [Zhang Lilei] didn't offer much explanation, just shook her head and brushed it off. As the evening breeze accompanied the nightfall, the office of the tea factory was bustling. [Song Daxiong] was tinkering with plants on the side, while the girls gathered around the computer.
1:10:38|1:10:49|Onlookers watched as the girl chatted with her boyfriend on video call, while the girl beside her played with a teacup in boredom. This scene was reminiscent of a few days ago, except for the absence of [Zhang Lilei] and another friend.
1:10:51|1:11:4|Hearing the greeting, [Song Daxiong] relaxed his furrowed brow, smiled at the girls, and continued to tinker with the plants on the shelf. In the dormitory at this moment, Ling Youqin and [Zhang Lilei] were deep in conversation, with her picking up a teacup.
1:11:44|1:11:55|[Zhang Lilei] had a look of worry on her face. The next morning, [Song Daxiong] and his mother were picking vegetables in the courtyard, both feeling extremely gloomy. [Song's mother] glanced at her son.
1:12:30|1:12:39|[Son Daxiong] stared blankly at the table. [Mother Song] saw [Son Daxiong]'s reaction and turned to look at the girls picking tea not far away.
1:13:7|1:13:19|Not far away, [Zhang Lilei] is picking tea leaves. Her movements are becoming more skilled, and her demeanor is like that of a native of the tea-growing region. The sky is already dark, the moonlight is strong, and the tree shadows are swaying.
1:13:19|1:13:31|[Sung Daxiong] squatted in front of the stone wall outside the bathroom, quietly listening to the cheers of the girls inside the house. His hands were tangled together, his brows furrowed, his mouth tightly twisted, and the calm atmosphere around him was completely different from the excitement inside the house.
1:13:34|1:13:44|The scene shifts, and it's already two months later. The tea-picking season of spring has quickly passed, and the girls are ready to return to their hometowns, walking out in a line with their suitcases.
1:14:3|1:14:20|[Zhang Lilei] hurriedly handed the luggage to her friend Qin and ran up to the rooftop. She rushed towards the clothesline, only to find her clothes hanging there alone, swaying weakly in the wind. She quickly went forward to take the clothes, but then turned around and saw something not far away.
1:14:23|1:14:36|[Zhang Lilei] sighed helplessly in his direction, picked up the clothes in his hand, and left. In his haste, he didn't notice a pair of socks he had missed on the clothesline. As noon approached, the girls had already boarded the bus, ready to depart.
1:14:39|1:14:51|The bus that bid farewell to the girls was surrounded by villagers reluctant to part. They gathered in front of the bus to say their final goodbyes to the girls. The older sister who received the face mask from Zhang Lilei pushed through the crowd, holding a package as she walked towards the bus window.
1:14:54|1:14:59|[Zhang Lilei] looked back at the departing crowd with a sense of loss.
1:15:16|1:15:28|After bidding farewell to the villagers, the bus slowly started and drove past the reluctant villagers, following the winding village road towards the tea plantation. Just as it had not been long since they left, there came a loud knocking on the bus door from outside.
1:15:34|1:15:45|[Zhang Lilei] hurriedly ran out of her seat and waited in front of the car door. Dr. Niu wrote down the words "心由境生" and looked at [Zhang Lilei]. She walked up to him.
1:16:6|1:16:35|After [Luo Mingying] settled down, the driver turned on the music and looked back at the girls in the car. With the music playing, the group set off again, swaying along the road. The bus traveled along the flat village road and arrived at a narrow path next to the valley. The winding path merged with the distant mountains. The bus swayed along the mountain road, carrying the girls towards the city. Dense trees on both sides of the road waved their branches vigorously, as if bidding farewell to the girls.
1:16:40|1:16:56|Sunlight streamed through the car window onto [Zhang Lilei]'s face as she gazed out the window, lost in thought. Meanwhile, [Song Daxiong] in Changyuanli stood blankly at the entrance of the female workers' dormitory, only to find it deserted with no one left behind by the girls.
1:16:56|1:17:0|The spring breeze suddenly rose, blowing away the curtains and also stirring up his thoughts.
1:17:2|1:17:29|[Sung Daxiong] looked at the socks dropped by [Zhang Lilei], staring blankly without knowing what he was thinking. In the bus at this moment, [Nie Youqin] reached out for [Zhang Lilei]'s hand. Is there still time now? [Zhang Lilei] shook her head with a serious expression. Seeing her shake her head, [Nie Youqin] could only turn his head to look ahead, no longer talking to [Zhang Lilei]. At the same time, in the [Song Family Courtyard], [Song Mother] and [Xiao Juan] were tidying up the tea house that the girls had placed in the courtyard.
1:17:54|1:18:5|[Sung Daxiong] is standing by the stone wall outside the bathroom, frowning. [Village Chief] slowly walks up to him, seeing no response from [Sung Daxiong], [Village Chief] continues.
1:18:41|1:18:57|[The village chief] laughed and patted [Zhang Lilei]'s arm, hooking his shoulder and leading him away. The two walked side by side to [Zhang Lilei]'s home courtyard, with [Zhang Lilei] still frowning heavily, looking burdened. Xia Juan warmly greeted the village chief upon seeing him.
1:19:2|1:19:19|Pouring water, [Mrs. Song] set aside the work in her hands and sat down with [Mr. Song] and the village chief at a small table on the side. The three of them looked at each other, none of them speaking to break the awkward silence. The village chief awkwardly looked around.
1:19:20|1:19:30|The village chief's words made the atmosphere even more bizarre. [Song Mu] glanced at the silent [Song Daxiong]. As he walked away, [Song Mu] turned to look at the village chief.
1:19:55|1:19:59|[Sung Daxiong] brought the tea set over and then went back inside to get other tools.
1:20:2|1:20:7|[Mrs. Song] looked at [Song Daxiong] skeptically, cleared her throat, and prepared to tame him with a stern pat on the head.
1:20:9|1:20:16|[Sung Daxiong] poked his head out and walked from the house to the small table, carrying a teapot. Sung's mother gave him a sharp look.
1:21:25|1:21:27|[Sung Daxiong] hurriedly ran out of the tea garden.
1:21:51|1:21:55|The village chief waved his hand at [Song Daxiong] and fumbled in his suit pocket.
1:21:59|1:22:20|[Sung Daxiong] looked at the village chief in confusion. After fumbling for a while, the village chief finally pulled out a phone book. The village chief ignored [Sung Daxiong] and squinted as he flipped through the thick phone book. After a while, the village chief finally found the number, took out his phone from his waist, and carefully compared it with the phone book before dialing the number.
1:22:20|1:22:49|On the return bus, the driver's phone suddenly rang, and he searched around to answer the call. After speaking, [Zhang Lilei] walked forward gracefully. After speaking, [Zhang Lilei] walked forward gracefully.
1:22:55|1:23:26|[Sung Daxiong] finally relaxed his furrowed brow and revealed a simple smile. The bus driver immediately slammed on the brakes after hanging up the phone, causing the bus to emit a piercing friction sound. The girls on the bus looked at the driver in panic. "Master driver, what's going on?" "I told you, if I move forward by one meter, I'll injure my leg." The girls were puzzled. "If my leg is broken, I won't be able to drive." The protective driver finished speaking and ignored the girls.
1:23:26|1:23:46|Wu Zi admired the beautiful scenery outside the window, with tall and dense trees on both sides of the road, their trunks varying in thickness and stretching out lush branches and leaves. The driver pressed the music button, and a melodious song slowly played, gradually immersing him in the cheerful music, his fingers lightly tapping on the steering wheel following the rhythm of the music.
1:23:46|1:24:0|He seemed to recall something, took out a can of tea from the side of the seat, disregarding the proper tea-making utensils and procedures, picked up a cluster of tea leaves with his hand and put them into a glass cup. He then quickly brewed a cup of hot tea with the nearby hot water kettle.
1:24:3|1:24:20|He gently blew away the hot steam from the tea cup he was holding, then took a sip of the fragrant tea. Unlike the driver's leisurely demeanor, the girls in the car felt a sense of relief and boredom. They kept adjusting their sitting positions, gazing out the window with a sense of distance between the opposite sexes.
1:24:20|1:24:26|The sun was getting stronger and stronger, waiting boringly for who knows when it will end, and someone simply put on sunglasses and fell asleep heavily.
1:24:28|1:24:39|On the winding road outside, a car broke the tranquility of the mountains and forests, driving from a small path behind the bus from afar, and abruptly stopped not far from the bus.
1:24:43|1:24:58|Before the bus even came to a complete stop, a figure slowly stepped out from the vehicle. She paused outside the bus for a moment, mustering up the courage to walk towards it. The girls inside the bus also noticed her at this moment, one by one leaning their heads out of the window, curiously looking out.
1:24:59|1:25:13|The figure walked up to the front of the bus and stood still. The girls then realized that the one chasing the bus was [Song Daxiong]. [Zhang Lilei] looked attentively at [Song Daxiong] outside the bus, only to see him cupping his hands around his mouth and shouting something.
1:25:13|1:25:25|Due to the barrier of music and car windows, Zhang Lilei stood up as she couldn't hear clearly. The music stopped, but she still couldn't hear Song Daxiong's shouting inside the car.
1:25:27|1:25:31|The girls rolled down the car window to listen, but it was in vain.
1:25:40|1:25:54|The car door opened, and [Zhang Lilei] hurriedly got out of the car. After getting out of the car, she didn't seem as rushed as before, instead, she walked towards [Song Daxiong] expressionless step by step. [Song Daxiong] put down his hands in confusion, not daring to meet [Zhang Lilei]'s gaze.
1:26:2|1:26:5|[Sung Daxiong] slowly lifted his head.
1:26:20|1:26:47|Without waiting for [Song Daxiong] to finish speaking, [Zhang Lilei] suddenly cried into his arms. The two of them were very close, and [Zhang Lilei] pressed her lips against [Song Daxiong]. The unspoken words melted in the warmth of their kiss. The heavens, earth, and mountains witnessed the overflowing love between them. At this moment, no one could separate them. The beauty of this moment made them forget everything around them. The village chief, with his mouth wide open, peeked at the two sleeping figures. The bus driver silently dialed the village chief's phone number.
1:26:51|1:27:12|The bus started again, slowly moving around the two who embraced each other and didn't want to part. A girl inside the bus stuck her head out, waving goodbye to [Song Daxiong] and [Zhang Lilei]. The bus gradually disappeared on the winding road, and the story of tea fragrance also came to a slow end.
