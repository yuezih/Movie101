0:1:14|0:1:38|In the vast wilderness, a withered tree stands tall. Shrouded in mist, the camera gradually zooms out, revealing a winding path among the undulating mountains. From far to near, a jeep approaches, carrying four young men and women, creating a particularly joyful atmosphere. The jeep speeds through the path, and a stone by the roadside reads "Red Wheat Forest".
0:1:38|0:1:43|The jeep drives by, revealing the title of the film, "The Watcher: Lost in Sin".
0:1:45|0:1:55|In the car, the four individuals arrived in front of an ancient mansion. Although the mansion was surrounded by trees, it inexplicably exuded a sinister atmosphere. [Chu Xiaoli] stepped forward to knock on the door and shouted.
0:2:17|0:2:38|I think if you want to stay tonight, you'll have to figure something else out. The four of them are about to leave and figure something else out. Just as they turned around, there was a muffled sound coming from the gate of the ancient mansion. The heavy gate slowly opened from the inside, accompanied by the cawing of crows, and [Chen Zhihui] walked out calmly.
0:2:38|0:2:41|The four quickly turned around, with [Chu Xiaoli] being the first to ask.
0:3:48|0:3:56|Four people woke up and hurried into the courtyard. The courtyard was heavily immersed, surrounded by plants, but the gloomy weather added a touch of coldness.
0:4:6|0:4:16|With a loud bang, [Chen Zhihui] closed the door and coldly advised the four people in the courtyard. Startled, the four of them entered the room where they lived, and the chubby one spoke.
0:4:53|0:4:56|[Zhi Qiang] and the fat guy came out of the room and spoke.
0:5:14|0:5:22|[Zhi Qiang] left alone, while the fat man became interested in the three large jars placed in the courtyard. He squatted down to observe carefully and muttered to himself.
0:5:55|0:6:7|[Chen Zhihui] watched the fat man leave, accompanied by a meow. As night fell, the four of them prepared to have dinner inside the house. [Chen Zhihui] held the cat and quietly observed the four in the courtyard.
0:6:47|0:6:59|After dinner, Fatso walked alone in the courtyard and became interested in the big jar. He squatted down to examine it carefully, when he heard a voice coming from behind.
0:7:22|0:7:26|[Chen Zhihui] invited Fatty into the room, and the two sat in front of the table.
0:7:47|0:7:49|He slowly unfolds a handkerchief.
0:7:54|0:8:2|Five hundred years ago, only the local chieftain was qualified to own it. [Chen Zhihui] slowly stood up with the headband in his hand.
0:8:8|0:8:13|Approaching the fat man from behind, [Chen Zhihui] put a headband on him, and a nail suddenly appeared in his palm.
0:8:19|0:8:22|He took out a soft hammer from his pocket again.
0:8:26|0:8:33|The hammer fell, and Chen Zhihui's eyes widened instantly. The next morning, Zhi Qiang suddenly sat up and walked into the interrogation room.
0:9:36|0:9:46|[Chu Xiaoli] and Zhenzhen were the first to leave the room. As they were leaving, [Zhi Qiang] looked puzzled at the neatly made bed. He turned to [Chen Zhihui] and asked.
0:9:59|0:10:8|[Chen Zhihui] looked on solemnly as the three of them left. The three drove a jeep and arrived near a flat grassland.
0:10:23|0:10:33|Zhenzhen and [Zhi Qiang] looked at [Chu Xiaoli], waiting for the phone to be answered. Unexpectedly, the ringing of the phone came from the fourth large vat that suddenly appeared in the ancient mansion.
0:10:42|0:10:46|[Zhi Qiang] came to the hill with a camera.
0:10:53|0:11:2|[Zhi Qiang] and Jane looked at each other, but unexpectedly Xiaoli suddenly chuckled. The two sighed helplessly.
0:11:9|0:11:13|Xiaoli turned around and walked back, Zhenzhen and [Zhi Qiang] started shooting on the hillside.
0:11:15|0:11:34|The scene suddenly changes, with a mysterious turn of the cat's head. Xiaoli pushes open the gate of the old mansion, and the cat then crouches down and runs away. Xiaoli enters the courtyard and finds it empty, then goes to her room. Upon opening the door, she discovers a large lock hanging on her room door.
0:11:34|0:11:39|Next, she turned and walked into the fat man's room, where there was still only an empty bed.
0:12:6|0:12:20|Xiaoli gently walked into the inner room and pushed open the half-closed door. The room was brightly lit, but still empty. Suddenly, a voice of Chen Zhihui came from behind.
0:12:21|0:12:26|Xiaoli suddenly turned around, and Chen Zhihui stood expressionless at the door.
0:13:15|0:13:28|[Chen Zhihui] bypassed Xiaoli and walked slowly to the door, ready to close it. The originally straightforward Chu Hongwei has already been conquered by Zhao Tianlan.
0:14:9|0:14:30|[Chen Zhihui] reached out to invite Xiaoli to sit down. Xiaoli looked hesitant but reluctantly sat down. [Chen Zhihui] then turned and walked into the gift area. In a moment, he appeared holding a headband in his hands. To everyone's surprise, this headband was exactly the same as the one shown to the fat man.
0:15:4|0:15:11|Chu Xiaoli took off the sunglasses on her head, while Chen Zhihui stood behind her and slowly put a headband on her.
0:15:33|0:15:38|[Chen Zhihui] holds a nail in his right hand and a hammer in his left hand, while Yang Qi is ready to nail it down.
0:16:30|0:16:45|Xiaoli waved goodbye to [Zhi Qiang]. Due to her limited mobility, Zhenzhen had to lean on the blanket and fell asleep. In a daze, she heard music coming from a distance. She sat up and listened carefully, as if she had remembered something.
0:16:46|0:16:52|Zhenzhen quickly got up and rushed to the courtyard, heading straight to the fat man's room and pushing the door open.
0:16:54|0:17:14|Pushing open the door, the neatly made bed was still there, with only the radio on the table playing music. [Chu Xiaoli] approached, picked up the radio on the table, and examined it closely. At that moment, the door behind her was slowly pushed open, and [Chen Zhihui] stared at [Chu Xiaoli] intently, who had not noticed him.
0:17:14|0:17:26|With a click, the scene cuts to [Zhi Qiang] and [Chu Xiaoli] taking photos. The gentle breeze brushes their faces as they look at the photos they've taken, sharing a smile.
0:17:38|0:17:49|Speak up, [Chu Xiaoli] called the fat man again, and the bell rang again from the big vat in the courtyard. But this time it just turned into five.
0:18:2|0:18:8|The two returned to the ancient mansion, pushed open the door of the main house, and found it empty inside.
0:18:11|0:18:25|Before they arrived at the carved flower factory covered by curtains, they exchanged a glance and suddenly pulled back the curtains. Only a few cushions were found on top. Suddenly, the voice of [Chen Zhihui] came over.
0:19:18|0:19:33|After saying that, [Chen Zhihui] turned around and left with the cat in his arms. The two of them looked puzzled and started searching inside the room. [Chu Xiaoli] tiptoed and searched in the wardrobe for what Zhenzhen mentioned, and found a bag. Upon opening it, she discovered that it was filled with snacks.
0:19:34|0:19:41|Just as [Chu Xiaoli] was trying to step further inside, she accidentally stepped on a mouse hole.
0:19:55|0:20:0|[Chen Zhihui] appears at the door of the room and walks in while speaking.
0:20:35|0:20:53|[Chen Zhihui] glared angrily, startling both of them. As [Zhi Qiang] hurried out of the room, he couldn't help but glance back at [Chu Xiaoli]. Meanwhile, inside the room, [Chen Zhihui] slowly turned his head to look at [Chu Xiaoli] with a cold gaze. [Chu Xiaoli] timidly averted her eyes.
0:20:58|0:21:21|As [Zhi Qiang] drove away, the night grew deeper. At this moment, a cat lay at the door, turning its head towards somewhere else, as if foretelling something was about to happen. Inside the house, [Chu Xiaoli] lay in bed, her injured foot bandaged, with no sign of [Chen Zhihui] in the room.
0:21:22|0:21:43|The overhead chandelier flickered, casting a eerie atmosphere. At this moment, faint tinkling sounds could be heard from the courtyard. [Chu Xiaoli], still half-asleep, was awakened by the noise outside, but seemed somewhat uncertain. She perked up her ears and listened carefully, the tinkling sounds becoming clearer.
0:21:45|0:22:9|He quickly got up and, ignoring his injured foot, limped out of the room following the sound. He arrived in the courtyard, where the sound was coming from a large vat. [Chu Xiaoli] walked slowly towards the vat in the courtyard, where the tinkling sound continued incessantly.
0:22:9|0:22:29|He tried to lift the lid with his hands. Five beats later, he squatted down again, trying hard to push the lid open. At that moment, a hand unexpectedly reached out from the jar, tightly gripping [Chu Xiaoli]'s neck. Her eyes widened in shock, struggling desperately. She woke up in an instant, sat up, and took a deep breath.
0:22:29|0:22:41|With a glance, [Chen Zhihui] holding a headband, silently stood at the doorway. [Chu Xiaoli] showed a hint of blue on her face and nodded.
0:23:13|0:23:18|[Chen Zhihui] stood behind [Chu Xiaoli] and slowly put a headband on her.
0:23:39|0:23:47|[Chen Zhihui] was holding a nail in his right hand and just touched the claw hammer in his pocket with his left hand when the door was suddenly pushed open by [Zhi Qiang].
0:24:21|0:24:25|After speaking, he did not leave the room.
0:24:37|0:24:42|[Zhi Qiang] turned around, took out a fruit knife from his backpack, and put it in his pocket. In the dim light, [Zhi Qiang] kept shining the surroundings, nervously carrying the fruit knife behind him, and followed [Chen Zhihui] to the hall.
0:25:3|0:25:10|[Chen Zhihui] unabashedly placed the ram's horn hammer on the table and walked over to sit across from [Zhi Qiang] with a smile on his face.
0:25:20|0:25:22|[Chen Zhihui] looks at the hands of [Zhi Qiang].
0:25:31|0:25:53|[Chen Zhihui] looked at [Zhi Qiang] with calm eyes, his gaze heavy as he displayed his hands to show his innocence. [Zhi Qiang] hesitated in his eyes, but still remained cautious. [Chen Zhihui] turned back into the room to fetch something, and the lights began to flicker again.
0:25:53|0:26:0|When the lights came back on, [Chen Zhihui] slowly walked out carrying a wooden tray engraved with various exotic beasts.
0:26:21|0:26:29|[Zhi Qiang] was puzzled, but still put away the water rolling knife behind him, took the wooden plate full of patterns with both hands, and carefully examined it.
0:26:32|0:26:35|In an instant, [Chen Zhihui] pulled out the dagger hidden under the wooden tray and stabbed towards [Zhi Qiang].
0:26:59|0:27:14|As the dagger was drawn, [Zhi Qiang] had lost consciousness and slumped from the chair. [Chu Xiaoli], who was walking out of the room, heard the bell ringing in the courtyard, as if she had remembered something.
0:27:30|0:27:39|Hearing the closing door, [Chu Xiaoli] looked up and saw [Chen Zhihui] holding a dagger, his hand slowly approaching [Chu Xiaoli] with a blood-stained dagger.
0:27:59|0:28:3|Chu Xiaoli nervously picked up the sheep horn hammer on the table for self-defense.
0:28:39|0:28:42|[Chu Xiaoli] is scared, only able to dodge back and forth in the room.
0:28:59|0:29:1|Huang Xiuli went wherever she went.
0:29:11|0:29:23|The killing intent suddenly appeared, [Chu Xiaoli] showed fear on her face, and accidentally bumped into the tea set in panic. Twenty years ago, Huang Xiuli became like this for a reason.
0:30:19|0:30:31|[Chen Zhihui] held a blood-stained dagger and advanced towards [Chu Xiaoli] step by step. Suddenly, the power went out. In the darkness, [Chu Xiaoli] managed to dodge the attack.
0:30:38|0:30:44|The blade flashed, and [Chu Xiaoli] could only rely on her voice to grope and dodge in the darkness.
0:30:48|0:31:7|In the darkness, all sounds were unusually clear. [Chu Xiaoli] held her breath, listening to the increasingly silent footsteps. Seizing the opportunity, she dodged and successfully avoided the dagger thrust. However, the footsteps and the sound of the blade continued, making [Chu Xiaoli] more nervous than ever before.
0:31:7|0:31:15|Unexpectedly, in the step-by-step evasion, the two collided back to back. [Chu Xiaoli] agilely squatted down, once again winning a chance to survive.
0:31:16|0:31:34|The danger is still ongoing, with [Chen Zhihui] in hot pursuit, luckily light reappears. As [Chu Xiaoli] opens her eyes, she sees [Chen Zhihui] with his back to her. Seizing the opportunity, [Chu Xiaoli] swings the sheep horn hammer in her hand and strikes down with force.
0:31:34|0:31:44|[Chen Zhihui] fell to the ground, [Chu Xiaoli] covered her face in disbelief, helplessly hugged her head and crouched down. Tears finally slid from her eyes at this moment.
0:31:46|0:31:52|The dust settles as the police rush into the once silent ancient mansion, searching for the missing individuals in the courtyard.
0:31:54|0:32:8|The policewoman wrapped the shocked [Chu Xiaoli] in a blanket, her helpless eyes filled with fear. [Chen Zhihui] lay on the ground without breathing, while the police were still collecting evidence. [Zhi Qiang] also received medical treatment.
0:32:8|0:32:21|[Chu Xiaoli] looked at the people coming and going in the courtyard with tears in her eyes. After the police searched for clues, they turned their gaze to the large vat in the courtyard. Sure enough, after a sound of shattering, Fatty and Zhenzhen were found curled up at the bottom of the vat.
0:32:33|0:32:51|[Chen Zhihui] was lifted onto a stretcher. The police, feeling sorry for him, gently closed his eyes and covered him with a white cloth, looking at his wide-open eyes. Also being carried on stretchers were the fat man and Zhenzhen. [Chu Xiaoli] watched as her friends were carried out one by one, only able to tightly hug the female police officer beside her, burying her head and crying bitterly.
0:32:54|0:33:20|In this bustling and chaotic ancient mansion, only the cat in the corner enjoys its solitude, quietly observing everything that is happening. As evening falls, a bus travels on the winding highway. Seated in the front row is a middle-aged man of medium build, lost in thought, boredly gazing out the window.
0:33:21|0:33:43|Night falls, the bus arrives at a small town, and the man reaches his destination. He stops in front of a small building called East Wind Inn, where a beautiful woman appears with keys and a water bottle. She leads the middle-aged man who just arrived at the door to the second floor of the inn.
0:33:54|0:34:14|After entering the room, Chen Zhihui looked around privately. In the small room, there was simply a small bed and a table. Chen Zhihui walked to the side of the bed and sat down to rest for a while. Just as he took out a cigarette and put it in his mouth, his phone rang.
0:34:53|0:35:15|[Chen Zhihui] hung up the phone, glanced at where the sound was coming from, and shrugged it off. He then got up and took out the toiletry bag from his backpack to get ready to freshen up. However, as soon as he took out the water cup for brushing his teeth, the continuous knocking sound from next door persisted. The man finally couldn't bear it anymore, heavily put down the water cup in his hand, and opened the door to go find the neighbor.
0:35:16|0:35:32|Pushing open the door to the next room, Chen Zhihui found it empty. After searching around, he noticed a nail on the wall, then walked closer to touch it, as if confirming whether the sound was coming from it. Just then, a voice came from the doorway.
0:35:34|0:35:41|The man turned around and saw [Chen Zhihui] standing at the door. As the light flickered, he saw the sledgehammer in [Chen Zhihui]'s hand.
0:35:53|0:36:11|[Chen Zhihui] did not say a word as he looked at him, instead he walked slowly into the room, passed the middle-aged man, hammered a nail into the wall, and then hung the picture frame on the wall.
0:36:13|0:36:36|Hua Bi turned around to look at the middle-aged man. The middle-aged man forced a smile and left awkwardly. [Chen Zhihui] didn't pay attention to the man's departure and continued to look at the butterfly painting on the wall. The next morning, the middle-aged man sat down on the first floor of the inn with breakfast.
0:36:36|0:36:40|He hadn't even sat down when the phone in his pocket started ringing.
0:37:19|0:37:28|The waiter pointed to [Chen Zhihui] behind the middle-aged man. He turned around and they both smiled politely. Then, the two of them sat at a table.
0:38:10|0:38:29|Just based on this breakfast, the two finished their breakfast and casually walked towards the door together. The middle-aged man noticed the [Female Manager] sitting at the front desk, with her neatly styled hair, delicate face, fashionable attire, and accompanied by lyrical music, she adjusted her temples.
0:38:29|0:38:46|Her every move exuded charm, causing the middle-aged man to involuntarily glance at her more. Meanwhile, [Female Manager] also noticed the middle-aged man at this moment. The two of them arrived at the entrance of the inn and started talking.
0:39:45|0:39:51|[Chen Zhihui] was puzzled and confused, the middle-aged man seemed to have figured something out, nodding his head knowingly.
0:40:23|0:40:28|[Chen Zhihui] did not stop, and then a middle-aged man came to Huang Jinzheng's door, knocked on it, and was greeted by a young man who opened the door.
0:41:15|0:41:19|[Zhou Dong] entered the room and saw a full wall of family photos.
0:42:22|0:42:35|To the sound of melodious music, a romantic atmosphere fills the inn. Two young waitresses are gracefully dancing the waltz. However, the two girls keep accidentally stepping on each other's feet.
0:42:38|0:42:44|At this moment, [Zhou Dong] returned from outside, and the young girl quickly stopped and stood aside.
0:43:1|0:43:8|The little girl without a mouth giggled, and [Zhou Dong] happened to see [Chen Zhihui] sitting in the lobby, so he went up to talk to him.
0:44:17|0:44:37|He finished speaking, got up to leave, then stopped in his tracks. He lowered his head and said to [Chen Zhihui]. After hearing this, [Chen Zhihui] fell into contemplation, standing alone in the spacious hall, pondering something.
0:45:34|0:45:42|[Chen Zhihui] still sat quietly without retorting. After [Zhou Dong] finished speaking, he lit the cigarette in his mouth without a care.
0:47:17|0:47:24|He refocused his gaze on [Chen Zhihui] and made a prediction.
0:47:38|0:47:42|The laughter of the front desk girl interrupted his words.
0:47:57|0:48:3|[Chen Zhihui] is waiting for [Zhou Dong]'s answer. [Zhou Dong] scratches his head and smiles, sitting up straight.
0:48:7|0:48:15|[Chen Zhihui] waited for his next move, but what came was [Zhou Dong] looking towards the door. The female manager of the inn, Red Sister, walked in unsteadily.
0:48:46|0:48:55|Red Sister was sitting at the front desk, looking down at her phone. With one hand lightly tapping the desk, she looked up and gazed at [Zhou Dong] in front of her.
0:49:27|0:49:46|The two held arms and smiled at each other, then looked away, creating a romantic and beautiful atmosphere. In the hall, [Chen Zhihui] couldn't stand the laughter of the two and got up to go upstairs, leaving behind the cat being held quietly.
0:49:49|0:50:14|The waiter drove the cat out, and [Chen Zhihui] returned to his room, looking through the window at the cat being driven away, curled up in a corner with no one around. It was three o'clock in the afternoon when [Zhou Dong] returned to the second floor to get his phone, suddenly remembering [Chen Zhihui] next door, and called out.
0:50:14|0:50:18|[Zhou Dong] quietly arrived at the next door, without knocking, he pushed the door open.
0:50:48|0:51:2|Accompanied by the exciting music, the two of them danced the tango together. [Chen Zhihui], invited by [Zhou Dong], also sat down on the first floor. However, he remained expressionless amidst the strong music, creating a stark contrast.
0:51:2|0:51:12|[Zhou Dong] was already immersed in the dance with Sister Hong, and the two waiters beside him also started dancing in a decent manner. Only [Chen Zhihui] maintained a constant expression from beginning to end.
0:51:14|0:51:31|As the music reached its climax, Red Sister spun around, and the two of them froze at the last second of the music. The waiter next to them also clapped and cheered, while [Chu Xiaoli] moved aside and wiped the sweat with a smile. [Zhou Dong] also came to [Chen Zhihui]'s side, taking the opportunity to chat with him while drinking water.
0:52:10|0:52:19|With a slight tightening forward, [Chu Xiaoli] showed no sign of annoyance, but instead began swaying her waist with the music. Just before the dance.
0:52:33|0:52:40|Put the birds raised by plants into the tent room.
0:52:47|0:52:54|After a dance, amidst the cheers of the waiters, [Zhou Dong] took a deep drag of his cigarette and continued chatting with [Chen Zhihui].
0:53:27|0:53:41|After speaking, [Zhou Dong] got up and left, while [Chen Zhihui] finally focused his gaze on the two. This time, the music became romantic, and the two faced off, each swaying their waist to show their charm.
0:53:42|0:54:0|[Zhou Dong] even took off his coat and stood up the collar of his shirt. On the other hand, [Chu Xiaoli] spun around and cut her hair in a flowing motion, creating wavy curls, and started dancing. Both of them were immersed in the enchanting music, moving in perfect harmony.
0:54:30|0:54:38|And those young men who once had dreams about her, too.
0:55:48|0:55:51|Also the room manager of a hotel.
0:56:7|0:56:14|[Zhou Dong] with red eyes, fiercely knocked the lighter on the table.
0:56:35|0:56:55|Startled by the sudden appearance, Hong Jie and others were taken aback. [Zhou Dong] locked eyes with [Chen Zhihui], his gaze cold and piercing, while [Chen Zhihui] seemed to have made a decision, slowly straightening up. As 5 o'clock in the afternoon approached, Hong Jie changed the music and prepared to invite [Zhou Dong].
0:58:9|0:58:25|After Zhou Dong smiled and replied, he walked towards [Red Sister], while Chen Zhihui still maintained the posture of his previous inquiry, as if savoring the answer. However, his eyes were fixed in one direction, seemingly with a hint of something inexplicable in his gaze.
0:58:25|0:58:45|Later, he stood up and walked towards the second floor. Although his steps were slow, they were full of determination. [Zhou Dong] stood in front of [Female Manager], bending over in a gentlemanly gesture, causing the waiters to laugh. But [Female Manager] was not coy at all, stepping on high heels and walking to the open space first.
0:58:45|0:58:48|They then held hands and swayed back and forth.
0:58:52|0:59:13|Twelve saw [Zhou Dong] raise his hand high, and [Red Sister] followed suit, dancing in a passionate and intense manner. The two of them were completely immersed in the dance. The waiter on the side also followed their movements and started dancing along. The atmosphere at the moment was harmonious and joyful. Meanwhile, [Chen Zhihui] had already arrived at the door of his room.
0:59:13|0:59:31|He forcefully pushed open the door of his room, his gaze falling on the corner hammer on the table. After gently touching it with his hand, he put the corner hammer into his pocket, closed the room door, and returned to the first floor. By now, the atmosphere downstairs had reached a climax.
1:0:9|1:0:14|[Red Sister] left with the waiter, [Chen Zhihui] walked over to [Zhou Dong]'s side.
1:0:16|1:0:35|Soon after, accompanied by the meow of a cat, the two of them stepped out of the Dongfeng Film Society. The scene kept switching between the two individuals and the cat, until finally freezing on their backs. By this time, it was already dark, and the two of them had arrived at their destination, in front of a house. [Zhou Dong] spoke up.
1:0:46|1:0:58|In this courtyard, a magnificent drama performance is being staged, with a full house and lively chatter among the audience. Old Master Huang Jingzheng is toasting the crowd.
1:1:9|1:1:29|Huang Hao brought [Zhou Dong] to visit the old master. After toasting, [Zhou Dong] took his seat. The fire-blowing performance on stage heightened the atmosphere. At this moment, [Chen Zhihui] appeared mysteriously in a corner of the courtyard, quietly observing everything.
1:1:57|1:2:13|[Zhou Dong] sat at the table, constantly looking around as if searching for something. It wasn't until he saw [Chen Zhihui] standing in a corner of the courtyard that a smile appeared on his face. The two of them raised their wine glasses in perfect harmony, clinking them together across the space and then finishing their drinks in one gulp.
1:2:13|1:2:19|And at this moment, the queen was drinking with guests when suddenly interrupted by a young man patting her on the back.
1:4:50|1:5:6|Chen Zhihui slowly took out the sheep horn hammer from his pocket, while Huang Hao lay silently on the sofa in the room, and a drunkard who had just mistakenly entered lay on the floor. After taking a careful look at the photo of Huang Xiuli, Chen Zhihui returned to the hall.
1:5:12|1:5:24|In the hall, the crowd cheered and urged a couple to come on stage to perform, and [Chen Zhihui] sat down next to [Zhou Dong]. When [Zhou Dong] saw him, he joyfully punched [Chen Zhihui] with his fist.
1:6:4|1:6:30|[Zhou Dong] could only smile wryly, and had to drink a few glasses of wine. Just then, the drunkard in the room slowly woke up, staggered out of the room, still clamoring for more drinks. The performance on stage made everyone burst into laughter, and the young man who had received a message from the queen also appeared next to the old emperor.
1:7:45|1:7:59|The old man was arrogant, only to see [Chen Zhihui] with a deep gaze, suddenly taking out the ram's horn hammer from his sleeve. This time, next to the sofa where Huang Hao was lying, there was an extra lounge chair, and [Huang Jingzheng] the old man was quietly lying on it.
1:8:3|1:8:15|[Zhou Dong] was a little tipsy, and when he looked up, his eyes met the gaze of the beautiful woman at the table. Before he could make a move, [Chen Zhihui] appeared from behind him.
1:8:29|1:8:42|Two beautiful women were bathing by the river, but he didn't even look and just walked away. After a drink, [Zhou Dong] started to feel drowsy, sitting in a chair and dozing off.
1:9:3|1:9:23|The elderly couple on the side looked at the standing Chen Zhihui and felt familiar, whispering to each other. Mrs. Huang was still looking for Mr. Huang, and the phone happened to ring.
1:9:40|1:9:44|The father and son are now drunk and can't speak.
1:9:57|1:10:4|Chen Zhihui appears behind the old lady, placing his hands on her shoulders and turning her body around.
1:10:35|1:10:43|The old lady was choked and stopped struggling after a few moments. The hall fell silent, leaving [Zhou Dong] alone leaning on the table.
1:10:50|1:11:9|Hey, Zhou Dong is unconscious. Chen Zhihui looked up and saw the untouched green needlefish on the table. It seemed like he realized something. He then turned off the power in the courtyard, plunging the entire mansion into darkness. In the dark, Chen Zhihui packed the fish, carried Zhou Dong on his shoulder, and casually walked out of the mansion.
1:11:11|1:11:29|Inside the inn, [Female Manager] was bored and staring absentmindedly at the fish tank in front of her when [Chen Zhihui] walked in carrying [Zhou Dong]. Seeing this, Red Sister immediately stood up, but [Chen Zhihui] didn't give her a chance to speak. He glanced at her, then calmly carried [Zhou Dong] upstairs.
1:11:32|1:11:44|Shortly after, [Chen Zhihui] placed [Zhou Dong] on the bed, considerately helped him take off his coat and covered him with a blanket, and prepared a glass of water on the side. [Zhou Dong] had already fallen into a deep sleep.
1:11:49|1:12:10|The cat looked at [Chen Zhihui] who approached, not running away in fear, but staring at him. [Chen Zhihui] opened the plastic bag in his hand, took out the packaged fish, placed it in front of the cat, squatted down quietly, and watched the cat eat the fish. At this moment, the man and the cat accompanied each other in the quiet night.
1:12:10|1:12:17|In the room, after waking up, [Zhou Dong] did not immediately get out of bed, but stayed in the covers and made a phone call to a friend.
1:13:46|1:14:4|As [Zhou Dong] sat up, it was already daytime outside the window of the inn, with people coming and going. A large truck slowly approached, filled with overflowing barrels. The boss's instructions to the driver could be heard from afar.
1:14:10|1:14:19|[Zhou Dong] is having breakfast in the lobby. [Chen Zhihui] sits down with a bag in hand.
1:15:37|1:15:43|[Chen Zhihui], with a slight frown in his eyes, pondered for a moment before answering with a faint smile.
1:15:46|1:15:51|The two packed up their things, carried their bags and walked out of the inn. As they passed the front desk, their steps hesitated slightly.
1:15:53|1:15:58|Upon seeing the two of them, Hong Jie stood up, glanced at [Zhou Dong], then at [Chen Zhihui], and asked.
1:16:11|1:16:27|[Zhou Dong] turned around and walked away. Just before leaving the gate, he turned back to look at Red Sister, smiled slightly, nodded in acknowledgment. Red Sister also kept her gaze on him, watching as [Zhou Dong] and the other person walked out of the inn.
1:16:27|1:16:36|[Chen Zhihui] found the cat at the door, held her in his arms, stood facing each other, ready to bid farewell.
1:16:42|1:16:53|At the entrance of the inn, [Chen Zhihui] carried a bag in his left hand and held a cat in his right hand, while [Zhou Dong] had his hands in his pockets, the two of them walking in opposite directions.
1:16:53|1:17:6|[Zhou Dong] took a few steps, then turned around to look at the not-so-broad back of [Chen Zhihui]. His only possessions were a newly found kitten and a bag in his hand. Lost in thought for a moment, he couldn't help but shout out.
1:17:9|1:17:15|[Chen Zhihui] turned around, while [Zhou Dong] stood in place, smiling and shouting.
1:17:24|1:17:40|A friend from afar came, a smile gradually appeared on [Chen Zhihui]'s face, [Zhou Dong] waved goodbye, [Chen Zhihui] turned around and left again. This time, the two of them parted ways completely, each embarking on a new journey.
1:18:51|1:19:3|[Female Manager] resumed her previous posture and looked towards the door. [Zhou Dong] had already boarded the departing bus, only to hear people on the bus discussing.
1:19:19|1:19:26|[Zhou Dong] smiled and looked out the window. The bus had arrived at Dream Tower, and he suddenly remembered what [Chen Zhihui] had said.
1:19:43|1:19:47|It's the carpenter who caused a murder case and was later sent to prison.
1:19:54|1:19:59|It is said that this guy was quite crazy back in the day, almost killed Huang Xiuli.
1:20:16|1:20:31|[Zhou Dong] rushed over and quickly got out of the car. As soon as he got out of the car, he started making a phone call, but no one answered. The scenes from a few days ago kept flashing through his mind. With a serious expression, he didn't care about the danger and directly hailed a car on the road.
1:20:31|1:20:42|Unfortunately, the vehicles on the road rushed past, and in the end, he only managed to stop a motorcycle. The motorcycle took him back to the door of [Zhou Dong]'s house, where he repeatedly knocked on the door.
1:20:44|1:21:4|Seeing no one answering, [Zhou Dong] ran back to the main street. By now, she was sweating profusely, but she dared not stop for a moment. It was noon, and the street was bustling with tourists and vendors, a romantic scene of fate. [Zhou Dong] stood still, at a loss, as if the whole world was spinning in her mind.
1:21:4|1:21:10|She could only shuttle through the crowd with all her might, time and time again, searching for the person she was looking for.
1:21:11|1:21:28|His eyes had started to turn cold, but he still didn't give up. Until he turned his head and saw a man who looked very much like [Chen Zhihui]. In that moment, the world was incredibly quiet, with only that man in his eyes.
1:21:28|1:21:32|He hurriedly caught up and pulled, only to realize that it was not the person he was looking for.
1:21:37|1:21:56|[Zhou Dong] got back on the bus, but it wasn't heading towards the provincial capital. He got off the bus in the rolling hills. The deserted road was empty, and he had to rely on his own legs to run under the scorching sun. After walking for who knows how long, feeling disoriented, he heard the sound of a car approaching from behind.
1:21:56|1:22:0|[Zhou Dong] confirmed repeatedly that it was not his own illusion, and quickly waved his hand.
1:22:1|1:22:12|Only two men and two women were seen in the car that arrived, and they were none other than [Chu Xiaoli] from the beginning. Ignoring the danger, [Zhou Dong] stood alone in front of the car and forcibly stopped it.
1:22:37|1:22:46|The car drove away, leaving [Zhou Dong] to continue on foot. As he walked along a mountain path, he encountered a mother and daughter talking as they approached.
1:23:7|1:23:19|[Zhou Dong] rushed to the entrance of the ancient mansion and immediately spotted the cat lying there, the same one that [Chen Zhihui] had taken away when he left. He instantly felt something was wrong, banging on the door frantically and shouting.
1:23:32|1:23:48|[Zhou Dong] kept knocking on the door repeatedly, but no one answered. He seemed a bit absent-minded for a moment, then turned around and saw a cat. It seemed to trigger something in him, and he vented his frustration by kicking the door. The cat was startled and ran away.
1:23:48|1:23:54|[Zhou Dong] looked lost and confused. As he left, he suddenly heard [Chen Zhihui]'s voice again.
1:24:0|1:24:13|[Zhou Dong] suddenly turned around, his eyes wide open, staring at the door. The camera kept zooming in, finally freezing on [Zhou Dong]'s figure, then passing through his body, replaying everything that had happened before.
1:24:13|1:24:23|The outline of the manor, [Chu Xiaoli]'s vigorous strike, the lively atmosphere of the Queen's family, the hot dance of [Zhou Dong] and Red Sister in the inn, and the first meeting of [Zhou Dong] and [Chen Zhihui].
1:24:24|1:24:46|The final shot is at the entrance of the Shunjiang City First Prison, where two soldiers stand guard in front of the imposing prison gates, with no one else in sight. In the silence, the sound of the door opening can be heard, and a middle-aged man with half-white hair and slightly wrinkled clothes walks out, who is none other than [Chen Zhihui].
1:24:46|1:24:58|[Chen Zhihui] walked a few meters and then stopped, looking up at the exceptionally clear sky. After a while, he turned around and looked back at the prison he had just walked out of.
1:24:58|1:25:13|After a moment of silence, [Chen Zhihui] arrived at a fork in the road. He stood still at the intersection, with signs on the road indicating "Dream Tower" to the left and "Pan Family Town" to the right. He looked left and then right, seeming a bit hesitant.
1:25:16|1:25:40|Hesitating, he turned and looked towards a teahouse by the intersection. Despite the crowded customers inside, it was not noisy. [Chen Zhihui] sat down and a waiter brought a teapot. The waiter pointed to the middle-aged man in black sitting by the window, who raised his teacup towards [Chen Zhihui].
1:25:44|1:25:54|Then she sat across from [Chen Zhihui] with a teacup in hand and struck up a conversation. She then raised the cigarette in her hand to ask [Chen Zhihui].
1:26:43|1:26:51|Chen Zhihui remained silent and shook his head at every question asked by the black-clad man.
1:27:31|1:27:36|[Chen Zhihui] looked solemnly, waiting for the response from [Black-clad Man].
1:27:53|1:28:4|As the waiter pushed open the door of the teahouse private room, a bald man took out a briefcase and placed it on the table. Across from him, another man also took out a briefcase.
1:28:9|1:28:28|The Black-clad Man gestured for Chen Zhihui to look towards the private room, where a waiter was just coming out, providing a clear view of the situation inside. The bald man was speaking, while a glamorous woman sat on the sofa beside him. In an instant, someone closed the door to the private room.
1:28:39|1:28:42|Da Bao looked around and saw no one nearby.
1:28:54|1:29:5|[Chen Zhihui] had no smile on his face, while the [Black-clad Man] spoke. He kept an eye on the situation in the private room as he spoke. Before [Chen Zhihui] could react, the [Black-clad Man] continued speaking.
1:29:33|1:29:46|The black-clad man chuckled and looked towards the two men coming out of the private room. Inside the room, the bald man closed the briefcase filled with RMB and then spoke to the glamorous woman.
1:29:54|1:29:57|The glamorous woman leisurely sips her tea.
1:31:10|1:31:23|The Black-clad Man stood up, pleading with Chen Zhihui with earnest eyes. Just as he turned to leave, Chen Zhihui reacted.
1:31:45|1:32:8|The black-clad man's eyes were flashing with almost insane anger and hatred. He pointed at Chen Zhihui, slightly pressing down his finger, indicating for Chen Zhihui to sit here. The black-clad man forcefully pushed open the door of the private room and looked at the bald man. Seeing the bald man avoiding eye contact, he then turned to the glamorous woman sitting beside him.
1:34:57|1:34:59|This guy, looks like he's willing to go through fire and water.
1:35:54|1:35:57|At this moment, Chen Zhihui has already left. The time is 25 seconds ago.
1:36:6|1:36:26|The glamorous woman took out an electric baton from behind, causing Bao Ge to fall down, and the gun accidentally fired towards the roof. Inside the house, only [Black-clad Man] and the [glamorous woman] were left. Unable to continue the act, the two hugged each other with tears in their eyes.
1:36:43|1:36:46|The younger brother pushed the door open and was also taken care of by [Black-clad Man] with an electric baton.
1:37:32|1:37:58|[Chu Xiaoli] couldn't bear to see [Black-clad Man] leave, so she hugged him from behind. However, [Black-clad Man] coldly pushed away the woman blocking his path, then hammered the door in self-reproach. He slowly set down the box, turned around, and apologized while explaining to the woman.
1:38:24|1:38:44|The woman sobbed silently, nodding with tears in her eyes. [Black-clad Man] carried the box and walked out of the private room. When he reached the lobby of the teahouse, he realized that [Chen Zhihui] had already left. This was undoubtedly a heavy blow to him. He scanned the lobby, refusing to accept the situation, hoping that [Chen Zhihui] was still there.
1:38:44|1:38:52|But after scanning the surroundings, [Chen Zhihui] was still nowhere to be found. He closed his eyes and walked out of the lobby as if resigned, then drove away.
1:38:54|1:39:16|He was unaware that [Chen Zhihui] heard the argument in the private room, which reminded him of himself and Huang Xiuli, who had already left the teahouse. Inside the room, the woman saw [Black-clad Man] leaving through the window. She then wiped away her tears, took out her phone, and resolutely pressed 110.
1:39:16|1:39:23|[Chen Zhihui] once again arrived at the fork outside the teahouse, looking at the two directions on the left and right, still standing there blankly.
1:39:26|1:39:40|And behind him, a car slowly drove in, which was the vehicle driven by [Black-clad Man]. The car passed by [Chen Zhihui] without slowing down, splashing dirty water directly onto [Chen Zhihui].
1:39:40|1:39:48|[Chen Zhihui] just lightly brushed off the sewage on his body, but at this moment, his gaze was firm, as if he had made a determined choice.
1:39:55|1:40:13|At half past six that evening, in a residential house, two elderly people sat at a set table, as if waiting for someone. One of the elderly, sitting in a wheelchair, glanced at the time and then said to their spouse.
1:40:51|1:40:59|The two elderly people looked towards the door with hopeful eyes, quietly waiting for the arrival of [Chen Zhihui].
