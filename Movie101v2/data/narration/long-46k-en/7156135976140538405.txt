0:0:49|0:0:53|In the beautiful mountain environment, the sound of horns echoed through every corner of the village.
0:1:40|0:1:55|The village echoed with the sound of the horn, [Yang Yinghua] wearing a straw hat, stood by the terraced fields filled with water, waving his hands to throw the seedlings into the terraced fields. Then he walked into the pond, bent down, and skillfully planted the seedlings neatly in the mud and water.
0:1:57|0:2:9|Suddenly, a bird's chirping echoed through the terraced fields. Accompanied by a man's singing, a phoenix bird flapped its wings and flew over from above the terraced fields, its sharp cry causing [Yang Yinghua] to look up from the terraced fields.
0:2:12|0:2:30|In the sky covered by dark clouds for thousands of miles, a brightly colored phoenix soared with its wings spread out. The scene moved until it flew to where the sun overlapped, then slowly disappeared. Several towering trees were planted by the terraced fields, forming a beautiful painting with [Yang Yinghua] working in the terraced fields.
0:2:30|0:2:38|[Wang Yingjun]'s wife [Ma Mei] slowly walks over with a little girl, and at this moment, the name of the film appears on the screen - Eighteen Buildings Village.
0:2:38|0:2:57|[Yang Yingjun] saw his wife approaching, so he put down what he was doing and walked forward. He wiped his hands on his pants, then squatted down to pick up the little girl. He used his hands to wipe the girl's runny nose. [Ma Mei], who was standing beside him, took off the basket on her back, lifted the cloth covering it, shook it to the side, and then spread it on the ground.
0:2:57|0:3:14|Continuing from the stele tower, the meals were brought out one by one and placed on the spread cloth. [Yang Yinghua] lifted the little girl, handed her to his wife, then picked up the food on the ground and started eating. He took a bite of chili and rice, then turned his head to the other side as if he had something on his mind, gazing at the American side.
0:3:16|0:3:37|Elsewhere, a man is beating a large drum in front of him, accompanied by a group of middle-aged women in ethnic clothing dancing and drumming. The scene shifts as a car drives through a tunnel, passing through Route 1, and then onto a bridge spanning two mountains, finally slowly driving on the winding road.
0:3:37|0:3:57|In a bustling market, a man with braided hair wandered aimlessly through the crowd. A small truck honked wildly as it passed by, catching the man's attention. He looked uncertainly at the two people inside the truck, but before he could say anything, the truck started up and drove away. The man with braided hair turned around.
0:3:57|0:4:4|Watching the direction the truck left in, he seemed to realize something after a moment, and quickly turned his head and ran towards home.
0:4:5|0:4:24|On the winding and rugged mountain road, a three-wheeled electric vehicle is driving, with Dumb Brother standing in the back looking out. At this moment, a sedan directly drives past from the side, splashing dust onto Dumb Brother's face. He raises his hand in disgust and waves it, while the sedan continues to move along the small road by the mountainside.
0:4:26|0:4:40|In front, a pile of stones blocked the passing vehicles, forcing a sedan to stop. A man wearing glasses got out of the car, walked up to inspect the road conditions, and then asked an old man herding cows passing by.
0:4:49|0:4:58|The man with glasses was incredulous for a moment, then looked in the direction the old man had left, opened his mouth in surprise, and finally turned his head helplessly towards the stone blocking the way.
0:4:59|0:5:19|On another overgrown hill, a pig was running around in the bushes. Not far away, [Yang Yinghua] and [Yang Lan] were frantically searching for the lost pig with worried expressions on their faces. Suddenly, the pig accidentally ran to the edge of a cliff and fell down, letting out a tragic scream. Hearing the sound, the two screamed and ran towards the cliff edge.
0:5:19|0:5:29|When the two arrived, they leaned over to look down the cliff. In the moment when [Yang Yinghua] was distracted, the old man took off the hat made of a long cloth strip on his head and untied it, wrapping it around his waist.
0:5:31|0:5:50|The old man handed the other end of the long cloth strip to the young man without saying a word, then he climbed down the cliff without hesitation. Meanwhile, [Yang Yinghua] was pulling the long cloth strip from above, his face showing a fierce and terrified expression as he shouted loudly. His eyes were tightly closed in fear, but his hands were still tightly holding onto the long cloth strip handed to him by the old man. After rescuing the pig, the two of them went straight back to the village.
0:5:51|0:6:13|On the other side, the man with glasses walked into the village with a big bag on his back. People washing clothes at the village entrance looked at him curiously, but he didn't stop. He walked up the stairs quickly, and the lady washing clothes greeted him. An old man in the village led a cow down the stairs, and the man with glasses moved aside to let the old man pass, then walked towards the village.
0:6:14|0:6:30|The scene shifts, Ma Mei rides a tricycle to the village entrance, but is blocked by stones ahead and can't proceed. Then, he swiftly jumps off the vehicle, takes a few steps, glances at the small car in front of him, and without looking back, runs towards the village.
0:6:30|0:6:42|The man with glasses arrived at the village committee of the Eighteen Buildings Village, where many tied-up quilts were hanging on the house. He looked up at the environment inside the house, and at that moment, a villager came over to greet him.
0:7:17|0:7:27|On the other side, Ma Mei shouted loudly in the village. As he shouted, a crowd also gathered behind him.
0:7:37|0:7:47|Braided Man led the crowd, step by step towards the highest point in the village. After walking for a while, he and the people behind him quickened their pace, taking big steps up the stairs.
0:7:54|0:8:1|The two in the room were tying up the pig they had just rescued from the cliff, when they heard someone calling their English League song, they got up and walked towards the door.
0:8:10|0:8:25|[Yang Yinghua] listened with a frown, then pulled a sickle out of the firewood and ran outside. Inside the house, [Yang Lan], who had just finished tying the beads, came out and was shocked to see this scene, with wide eyes and an incredulous expression.
0:8:31|0:8:51|The man with braids chased after [Yang Yinghua] to a corner, where he met [Ma Mei] who had just finished delivering food to her husband. After listening to the man with braids, she immediately picked up the little girl next to her and ran towards her husband. [Yang Yinghua] then dropped the door curtain and ran outside.
0:8:51|0:8:54|People in the neighborhood committee heard the shouting and quickly ran out.
0:8:59|0:9:12|[Dumb Brother] ran with a sickle held high in his hand on the village road, with villagers chasing after him. [Yang Yinghua], who rushed from the field, met Dumb Brother at a turn and grabbed his wrist holding the sickle.
0:9:31|0:9:46|After speaking, [Yang Yinghua] took Dumb Brother away, and the teacher who was just saved by Dumb Brother fainted immediately in the crowd. [Yang Yinghua] and Dumb Brother rode a tricycle to rush to the market.
0:10:5|0:10:10|Yang Weiwei heard the shouting, turned her head to look at the newcomer, and immediately spoke to the man beside her.
0:10:26|0:10:36|Ling Lian Ge quickly walked towards the two, picked up the nearby object, and smashed it towards the person on the right. Daughter Xiao Weiwei squeezed from behind, but couldn't stop this farce.
0:11:2|0:11:12|Ma Mei first pointed at Shi Youcheng across the street, then gestured something in sign language. The police officer was puzzled on the side, and then asked [Yang Yinghua] sitting next to him.
0:11:53|0:11:57|[Ma Dongjun] warned Dumb Brother and then reached out to wipe his forehead.
0:12:20|0:12:37|The police officers nodded slightly upon hearing this. Shi Youcheng handed the money to Xiao Weiwei, then gave her a tug on the arm, indicating for her to give it to Brother Yinglian. Xiao [Weiwei] stood up from her seat, walked slowly to her father, and then placed the money into his hand.
0:13:27|0:13:38|After Yang Weiwei finished speaking, she bowed to her father and Yang Yinghua, then was pulled away by Shi Youcheng. Yinghua and Poverty Alleviation Leader sat in their seats, tears welling up in their eyes, without saying a word.
0:13:39|0:13:47|They both got on the open-air tricycle back to the village. When they arrived home, [Ma Mei] sat at the dining table and advised Dumb Brother.
0:14:10|0:14:21|Elian couldn't help but choke up as she listened to [Ma Mei], then wiped away her tears with her sleeve. [Yang Yinghua] sat silently on the side, then picked up the glass of water on the table and took a sip.
0:14:23|0:14:46|The little girl is riding a plastic pony near the door. At this moment, Dumb Brother walks slowly into the room from outside. He carefully pulls out a chair at the dining table and sits down. Looking at the silent three people, he nervously rubs his hands together between his legs and then speaks.
0:15:7|0:15:11|The man with braids looked at the three people at the dining table, then said to [Ma Mei].
0:15:15|0:15:21|[Ma Mei] got up and walked towards the kitchen after hearing that. The man with braids looked at her back and spoke.
0:15:23|0:15:33|Before long, [Ma Mei] held the chopsticks in front of her and used a bowl to serve her soup. The man with braids picked up the chopsticks and said to Brother Yinglian and [Yang Yinghua].
0:15:36|0:15:42|After speaking, Ma Mei picked up the chopsticks and started eating. Then he spoke.
0:15:46|0:15:55|[Yang Yingjun] shouted loudly after hearing this. After [Yang Yingjun] finished speaking, the dining table fell into silence.
0:16:49|0:17:5|Braided Man mentioned the atmosphere was off, threw the chopsticks and turned his head away. Ma Mei quickly intervened upon seeing this scene. At night, [Yang Yinghua] entered a room alone, using his hands to push aside the wheat stalks in front of him, revealing a porcelain vessel containing something.
0:17:6|0:17:22|Yang Yinghua slowly came down from the second floor with one hand holding the porcelain and the other hand supporting the ladder. Wang Shen found a chair and sat down. Then, he opened the lid of the porcelain in his arms, took out something wrapped in cloth from inside, and placed the porcelain on the side of the chair.
0:17:22|0:17:27|He then opened the cloth, removed the cards and certificates on top, and picked up the one at the bottom.
0:17:28|0:17:45|Daughter's graduation certificate, with a few hundred yuan bills tucked inside. [Yang Yinghua] held the bills in his hand, gazing at his daughter's photo on the certificate. He then folded the certificate neatly, smoothed out the bills in his hand and placed them on his lap, before taking out more money from his shirt pocket.
0:17:45|0:17:55|Putting the one hundred yuan bill that her daughter gave her during the day together with the previous one hundred yuan bill, she then sorted out the remaining change and put it together with the one hundred yuan bill.
0:17:56|0:18:14|He was sorting out the banknotes while choking back tears. Unable to hold it in any longer, he burst into tears. After a while, [Yang Yinghua] finished organizing the money, put everything back into the porcelain, then climbed to the second floor and buried it in the wheat.
0:18:14|0:18:23|On the other side, [Yang Yinghua] arrived at the village committee that was already full of people. Before long, [Dumb Brother] walked over and sat next to him. At that moment, someone spoke up.
0:19:43|0:19:51|[Braided Man] listened and happily patted [Yang Yinghua] on the shoulder, while [Yang Yinghua] walked out with a face full of anger, always hard to please, and quickly followed.
0:20:16|0:20:23|[Yang Yingjun] ignored the advice. He pushed [Teacher Man] aside and walked away, leaving [Teacher Man] looking helplessly at his back.
0:20:23|0:20:41|[Yang Yingjun] who left the drama committee came to the field, bending over and making some noise in the water. His mind went back to his desire for a crowded life with his wife. In front of him were his son, daughter-in-law, and sick granddaughter. His son looked blank, while his daughter-in-law couldn't bear to look.
0:20:41|0:20:50|[Yang Yingjun] and his wife stood aside, at a loss. The scene then shifted to him holding his granddaughter in his arms, boarding the bus with his wife.
0:20:50|0:21:5|The two of them sat in the car in silence, their thoughts unknown. [Yang Yinghua]'s skillful hands gradually stopped, holding seedlings in his hands. He slowly straightened up, breathing heavily, making him appear less calm.
0:21:5|0:21:20|[Yang Yingjun] stared blankly ahead, and after a while, he returned home alone. [Yang Yingjun] stood in the hall for a long time unable to calm his emotions, took a moment to compose himself, then walked towards the dining table and picked up the glass of water on it to take a sip.
0:21:20|0:21:28|Ma Mei looked at her sleeping granddaughter in the room. Hearing a noise outside the door, she reached out to pinch her granddaughter's feet, then got up and walked towards the door.
0:21:29|0:21:42|The creaking sound of the door opening made the granddaughter turn her head, luckily it didn't wake the child up. [Ma Mei] tiptoed out, slowly closed the door, and then walked to the dining table.
0:22:27|0:22:34|[Yang Yinghua] hands the water cup to Ma Mei, who takes it and then turns to leave.
0:22:44|0:22:59|[Yang Yinghua] blocked the grain in the hands of the thief, then put the lid of the wooden barrel down. The two of them came to a small wooden barrel on the side. Ma Mei opened the lid of the wooden barrel, inside of which was half a barrel of rice. She then opened several other wooden barrels nearby, each containing peanuts and duck eggs.
0:23:0|0:23:18|Next, he didn't open the ceramic jar at home first. Inside it were liquor, cigarettes, salted vegetables, dried fish, and the few remaining chili peppers. [Yang Yinghua] opened the unplugged refrigerator at home, which was empty inside. He reached into the second layer of the partition and pulled out a small tiger plush toy.
0:23:19|0:23:35|After squeezing it in his hand, he placed it above the refrigerator and then closed the refrigerator door. [Yang Yinghua] saw this scene and helplessly turned away. [Ma Mei] stood by, her eyes following him, and both of them remained silent in unspoken agreement.
0:23:35|0:23:45|[Yang Yinghua] walked to the wall, looked at the photos on the wall, sighed helplessly, pinched his brow, then walked to the chair and sat down, opening his mouth to ask.
0:23:49|0:23:52|[Yang Yinghua] turned his head and looked at [Ma Mei], saying,
0:24:13|0:24:24|[Ma Mei] looked at [Yang Yinghua]'s face in surprise, then straightened up and carefully examined the accounts on the table. After that, she turned to her husband and said,
0:24:28|0:24:32|[Yang Yinghua], after listening to [Ma Mei]'s words, thought for a moment and then said thoughtfully,
0:24:50|0:24:57|[Yang Yinghua] sat aside watching him, only to see [Ma Mei] licking her fingers, then flipping through the account book. After finding the answer, she said,
0:25:22|0:25:26|[Yang Yinghua] silently looked at [Ma Mei] and after a while said,
0:25:38|0:25:42|[Yang Yingjun] sighed helplessly, then said persistently,
0:26:33|0:26:40|[Ma Mei] lowered his head in silence, but [Wang Shen] suddenly exclaimed with joy. [Ma Mei] nodded after hearing it, [Wang Shen] cleared his throat and continued, while Ma Mei looked at her husband's desolate appearance.
0:27:2|0:27:5|He turned to [Yang Yinghua] and comforted him.
0:27:31|0:27:40|[Yang Yinghua] finished speaking, turned his head and took a deep breath. Ma Mei looked at his appearance, sighed, then closed the account book on the table and said earnestly.
0:28:3|0:28:8|On the other side, a group of people were having a meeting in the village committee, with the leader sitting in the main seat speaking.
0:28:24|0:28:35|Everyone sat around the table, listening attentively to him speaking, nodding in agreement. Outside, the rain was drizzling, and most of the people had already left the village committee.
0:28:35|0:28:50|The male teacher looked up at the blanket above the room, then he lay straight on the back of the chair with his arms crossed in front of his chest. Wang Shen, who came from the city, turned his head to look at him, and at this moment the male teacher spoke.
0:30:15|0:30:20|The teacher looked gloomy, and after a moment of contemplation, Little Wang spoke.
0:30:26|0:30:46|After listening to Xiao Wang's words, [Wang Shen] sighed and said, "I understand." Then, [Wang Shen] stood up and left the village committee. Xiao Wang held the documents in his hand, but his eyes were fixed on [Wang Shen]'s departing figure. After a while, he shifted his gaze back to the documents in his hand.
0:30:46|0:31:1|Early the next morning, the rooster in the village stood on the high platform and crowed. He shook his body, tidied his feathers with his beak, and then walked back and forth on the platform. The breeze blew, and his feathers danced in the air. A new day was about to begin.
0:31:2|0:31:15|[Ma Mei] sat barefoot in front of her own door, she combed her hair, wrapped the headscarf around her forehead in circles, then washed clothes in the yard, while her granddaughter sat on the side looking up at the sky.
0:31:15|0:31:26|The entire village gradually woke up after a quiet night, with villagers starting to head to the fields one after another. Children carried their school bags and happily went to school.
0:31:27|0:31:44|[Yang Yingjun] is throwing seedlings into the field by the terraces. The teacher, holding a precise poverty alleviation list, a list of impoverished households, and a list of paired assistance, nails it on [Yang Yingjun]'s door. Xiao Wang is behind him handing him the nails. [Ma Mei] hears the commotion and quickly brings her granddaughter out to check on the side.
0:31:45|0:32:6|The teacher used nails to tease the little girl, while Xiao Wang looked at the silly look of the little girl, pondering something. After the two left, [Ma Mei] took her granddaughter to the field to find her husband. [Ma Mei] looked nervously at the slope above and [Yang Yinghua] spoke up and asked.
0:32:8|0:32:24|Sensing something amiss in the atmosphere, Yang Yinglian, who was working nearby, looked up at [Yang Yinghua] and then at [Ma Mei]. [Ma Mei] chirped about what had happened. [Yang Yinghua] became furious upon hearing it, dropped the farm work in hand, and immediately rushed back home to investigate.
0:32:24|0:32:34|He walked to his own door, his eyes fixed on the poverty alleviation credit card, and he was so angry that he tore it off directly. [Ma Mei] arrived with her granddaughter and saw this scene as soon as she arrived.
0:32:38|0:33:0|Several people from the village committee heard the news and hurried to [Yang Yinghua]'s house. Before they could enter, they were pushed out of the door by [Yang Yinghua]. The people from the village committee hadn't finished speaking when [Yang Yinghua] brushed past them and walked outside. Seeing this, they quickly followed and tried to persuade him.
0:33:2|0:33:20|[Ma Mei] clung to the door, watching the departing crowd. Her mouth was wide open, her eyes staring straight at the direction her husband left, as if she was stunned by the scene. Soon, it started to rain heavily, the raindrops falling on the piled-up old tiles, making a pitter-patter sound.
0:33:20|0:33:26|[Ma Mei] stood beside the window in her house, her hands resting on the edge of the window, her eyes gazing into the distance.
0:33:28|0:33:47|The sound of the granddaughter's babbling came into her ears, [Ma Mei] slowly turned her head and looked at the little girl playing on the eaves, her thoughts going back to the day of her granddaughter's diagnosis. [Yang Yinghua] was holding the granddaughter still in the bundle, with [Ma Mei] carrying the stele behind him, walking in the mountains.
0:33:47|0:33:55|Walking along the way, suddenly a light rain started to fall. They took shelter by the rocks with their granddaughter, thinking about what the doctor had just said.
0:33:57|0:34:7|Dad is seriously ill, and both of them were shocked when they heard the doctor's words. [Ma Mei] looked at her husband with concern.
0:34:45|0:34:49|[Ma Mei] touched her husband's arm when she saw him not responding.
0:34:58|0:35:12|[Ma Mei] listened solemnly as [Yang Yinghua] spoke, while wearing a smile on her face. Shortly after, [Ma Mei] unwrapped the rouge fish wrapped in leaves and laid it out on the porridge, then took out a five-kilogram liquid in a plastic container to treat her granddaughter's illness.
0:35:13|0:35:29|In this way, [Ma Mei] carries her granddaughter in a bamboo basket every day, with a radio hanging on the basket, trekking through mountains and rivers to the clinic for treatment. Rain or shine, cold or hot, day after day, year after year, [Ma Mei] takes her granddaughter to see the doctor.
0:35:32|0:35:49|As time passed, the granddaughter no longer needed to be wrapped in blankets. [Ma Mei] still carried her in a bamboo basket to see the doctor. As the granddaughter grew older, she also learned to walk on her own, and [Ma Mei]'s expression changed from serious to smiling.
0:35:50|0:36:4|On the way to see a doctor, the granddaughter tried to walk by herself, with [Ma Mei] guarding her from behind. When the granddaughter was about to fall, [Ma Mei] quickly stepped forward to protect her. After a while, the granddaughter was able to walk by the edge on her own.
0:36:4|0:36:18|She tilted her head up to the sky, with her tongue awkwardly twisted at the corner of her mouth, sitting on the doorstep babbling, and then playing with a plastic toy horse in the room. [Yang Yinghua] and his wife watched happily beside her.
0:36:53|0:37:14|After the flashback, [Ma Mei] smiled as she watched Little Pumpkin play by the window, then she walked up to him and gave him some water. At night, the atmosphere in the village committee was unusually tense, everyone sat in a circle, all unconsciously looking at Dumb Brother. Wang Shen sat beside him, blinked but didn't say a word.
0:37:14|0:37:32|Suddenly, the teacher man spoke up. With a blank expression, he announced the decision, causing everyone around to turn and look at him, no one said a word. One day, clouds filled the hills and terraces, like a beautiful painting.
0:37:32|0:37:40|Before the villagers had even started working, [Yang Yinghua] carried a backpack and dragged a suitcase, slowly leaving Shibaodong Village.
0:37:46|0:38:3|[Ma Mei] is washing clothes at the village entrance with Little Pumpkin. At this moment, a big lady comes down the stairs holding a basin of clothes. She squats next to [Ma Mei] and takes out a piece of clothing from the basin to start beating it. The big lady looks at [Ma Mei] and speaks.
0:38:12|0:38:36|[Ma Mei] was shocked by what the old lady said, she immediately raised her head and forgot to continue beating the clothes in her hands. Then, she quickly ran to the field with Little Pumpkin on her back to find her husband. Upon learning the situation from [Ma Mei], [Yang Yinghua] stopped his work immediately and ran towards the direction where Little Dragon had left.
0:38:36|0:38:52|He hurriedly climbed the steps, and after running for a while, finally saw Xiaolong, who was carrying a large bag and pulling a suitcase, ready to leave on the road at the edge of the village. [Yang Yinghua] quickly walked up to him and began to explain.
0:39:48|0:40:3|After Xiaolong finished speaking, he disappeared dramatically into the bustling street, leaving [Yang Yinghua] standing alone in a daze. He was dressed in Tibetan clothing for geological work, which made him stand out in this city.
0:40:27|0:40:38|[Yang Yingjun] took off his straw hat and remained silent. He gestured for his comrades to enter the room for further discussion. Understanding his signal, his comrades followed closely behind. [Yang Yingjun] then spoke.
0:42:19|0:42:21|Later, everyone went to work in the countryside.
0:42:27|0:42:47|[Yang Yingjun] listened to his comrades without saying a word, deeply exhaling. His comrades looked at him and remained silent as well. Later, [Yang Yingjun] sat in the small truck heading back to the village, driving on a road surrounded by terraced fields, watching the young rice seedlings planted on both sides.
0:42:47|0:42:54|The thoughts went back to the moment when Ma Mei and Wang Shen were separated in the crowded train station, with Ma Mei calling out her name in desperation.
0:43:3|0:43:18|Due to the large crowd, the wife reached out at the station but couldn't catch him. [Yang Yinghua] sat in the car, watching the large trucks and logistics vehicles passing by on the overpass in the distance. After a while, he withdrew his gaze.
0:43:18|0:43:25|In my mind, I see a scene of a family of three sitting at a table eating, with [Ma Mei] sharing her food with her son and then speaking to [Yang Yinghua].
0:43:37|0:43:57|Soon, it was time for [Ma Mei] to go out to work. At the station, there were workers carrying big and small bags everywhere, their bodies pressed against each other as they slowly made their way to the train. The platform was already packed with people, and the train staff could not maintain order as large groups of people squeezed onto the train.
0:43:57|0:44:4|More daringly, some people climbed onto the train directly from outside the window, with [Ma Mei] among them, one of her feet hanging outside as she shouted loudly.
0:44:12|0:44:17|[Yang Yinghua] struggled to lift her up outside the train, and finally [Ma Mei] successfully entered the carriage.
0:44:49|0:45:4|[Yang Yingjun] sat on the small truck returning to the village, recalling his wife's encounter at the station. He hugged his curled legs with both hands, wearing a straw hat and lowering his head, twisting his mouth lost in thought. Finally, at the station, [Ma Mei]'s outstretched hand was grabbed by [Yang Yingjun].
0:45:8|0:45:23|[Yang Yingjun] held [Ma Mei]'s hand and moved against the crowd at the crowded station. He protected his wife behind him, pushing through the crowd with determination, leading her away from the station. [Ma Mei] followed behind him, frowning and gritting her teeth, walking with her head down.
0:45:24|0:45:38|Everyone was walking towards the train, only [Yang Yinghua] and [Ma Mei] were walking out. In the crowd, the two of them stood out. After coming out of the station, [Yang Yinghua] and [Ma Mei] walked on the mountain road back to the village.
0:45:38|0:45:48|[Yang Yingjun] looked back in plain clothes, walking with [Ma Mei] who was dressed brightly, swinging her arms. The two smiled at each other, but couldn't go home together, feeling joyful.
0:45:50|0:45:59|After reminiscing, [Yang Yinghua] still sat in the small truck heading home, his face expressionless as he pondered over the various events that had occurred earlier. Doubts had already begun to creep into his mind.
0:46:1|0:46:20|After a day of trivial matters, as the sun gradually began to set, the sunlight sprinkled on the terraced fields, creating a warm and cozy atmosphere. [Yang Yinghua] returned to the field to continue working, wearing a straw hat and bending over to plant seedlings in the muddy water. His clothes were covered in mud, but he paid no attention to it at all.
0:46:22|0:46:37|After a busy period, [Yang Yinghua] squatted by the terraced fields to wash his hands. He thought about how his resignation due to poverty had caused Little Long to suffer. His comrades had all become wealthy, while he was labeled as a poor household, which made him choke with emotion.
0:46:37|0:46:45|He turned his head towards the direction of the sun, slowly straightened his body, and looked at the seedlings that had already been planted in front of him, feeling a mix of emotions in his heart.
0:46:47|0:47:0|[Yang Yingjun] stood facing the sun by the terraced fields, the setting sun shining on his face. His brows were furrowed, trembling as he pursed his lips, tears welling up in his eyes, showing a deep sense of bitterness and vicissitudes.
0:47:18|0:47:32|[Yang Yingjun] stood still in the mud, his back reflected in the water. After a moment of calm, as if accepting his failure, he lifted the empty bamboo basket hanging on the carrying pole and left.
0:47:35|0:47:51|The gentle breeze blows, the delicate seedlings swaying slightly in the mud, the beautiful scenery appearing particularly heavy due to [Yang Yinghua]'s mood. Back at home, a simple living platform was set up on the open space, with [Ma Mei] squatting on the ground, using her mouth to blow into a bamboo tube for daily living.
0:47:51|0:47:59|Then she put down the bamboo tube and used her hands to push the firewood towards the center. The smoke from daily life coughed like the little pumpkin.
0:48:1|0:48:21|She slowly stood up with her hands supporting on her legs, then looked towards [Yang Yinghua] behind her. All the dishes on the table were already set, with [Yang Yinghua] holding a bowl and chopsticks in hand, leaning against the back of the chair with head down, already asleep.
0:48:21|0:48:28|[Ma Mei] saw [Yang Yinghua] exhausted and asleep on the chair, so she walked slowly to her and sat down opposite her, staring at her quietly.
0:48:30|0:48:50|[Yang Yingjun] still maintained that posture, not moving at all. The two of them sat here quietly. At night, the man with braids stripped off his upper body and wiped himself at the place where he washed clothes at the village entrance. Before long, Xiao Wang came down the steps with a basin and toiletries.
0:48:59|0:49:14|After Braided Man finished speaking, he turned around and put on his clothes. Little Wang squatted behind him, looking at the two thick and long scars on Braided Man's back. He immediately stood up in shock. Braided Man finished putting on his clothes, turned around to look at him, and explained.
0:49:29|0:49:38|Little [Wang Shen] listened and then squatted down to start working again. When he heard someone crying, he looked around and saw the man with braids talking while putting on his jacket.
0:50:28|0:50:36|It's difficult to finish the transformation, so he stood up, picked up the bucket, and wanted to leave. Little [Wang Shen] looked at the well next to him and asked.
0:51:16|0:51:31|Little [Wang Shen] watched as the man with braids walked away, lost in thought. The structure of the well was carved into the stone, surrounded on both sides and at the back by stones. A stone was placed on top of the stones, leaving only one side of the well open.
0:51:31|0:51:36|Little [Wang Shen] sat on the stone platform next to the well for a while, then turned his head towards the well.
0:51:39|0:52:0|Seeing the bowls placed above the well, [Wang Shen] couldn't help but stand up and walk towards the well. Little [Wang Shen] looked down at the slowly flowing clear spring water in front of him, picked up the bowl above, scooped a bowl of water from the spring, and placed it in front of his chest. He looked down, took a sip to taste it, then held the bowl with both hands, tilted his head back, and drank it all.
0:52:0|0:52:3|After tasting the sweet spring water, [Dumb Brother] smacked his lips.
0:52:6|0:52:26|Early the next morning, the women in the village were washing their dirty clothes by the well, with [Ma Mei] and Little Pumpkin among them. Little Pumpkin was playing with toys, standing on a pillar on the side, while [Ma Mei] squatted on the ground washing clothes. Nearby, an old man carried a back basket and led the cow up the steps, as a new day was about to begin.
0:52:30|0:52:45|[Yang Yinghua] walked towards the field carrying a basket full of seedlings. At this moment, he was the only figure in the mountains, making him appear so lonely. Down the mountain, smoke rose from cooking fires, adding a touch of warmth to the scene.
0:52:45|0:52:53|He stood by the terraced fields, tossing the seedlings from the bamboo basket into the mud, took a deep breath, and then started planting the seedlings.
0:52:58|0:53:11|[Yang Yinghua] is working in the field, when [Wang Shen] approaches from a distance. Seeing the busy [Yang Yinghua], without hesitation, he wades into the mud and water, walking towards him while speaking.
0:53:16|0:53:26|[Yang Yingjun] stood up straight and was stunned after hearing this, while [Wang Shen] didn't offer any explanation. He skillfully picked up the seedlings, bent over, and started planting them on the side.
0:53:28|0:53:34|[Yang Yinghua] stood still and looked at him quietly. After a while, he spoke up and asked.
0:54:23|0:54:41|As they chatted, the two of them talked until dusk. [Yang Yinghua] walked ahead, while [Wang Shen] followed behind carrying a shoulder pole. They slowly made their way towards [Yang Yinghua]'s home. As they entered the house, Little Pumpkin was sitting on a plastic toy horse, staring blankly at the newcomers.
0:54:41|0:54:47|The walls of the house are covered with photos of the [Yang Yinghua] family. Upon entering, [Wang Shen] stands by the wall and looks at them.
0:54:50|0:55:1|[Yang Yinghua] brought three fish, a bowl of chili, and chili powder to the dining table. [Wang Shen] held his bowl and ate his meal heartily. [Yang Yinghua] stared at him and said.
0:55:4|0:55:18|[Wang Shen] was stunned for a moment after hearing it, then his gaze shifted to [Yang Yinghua]. [Yang Yinghua] took a sip of wine from his bowl and then set it down. Wang Shen also put down his bowl, staring straight at him.
0:56:23|0:56:44|[Yang Yingjun] picked up the bowl and took a sip of wine, then [Ma Mei] continued. [Yang Yingjun] and Wang Shen remained silent after hearing it, while [Ma Mei] squatted on the ground to start a fire with a bamboo tube, then placed the bamboo tube on the ground before sitting down on a nearby chair.
0:56:58|0:57:11|[Yang Yinghua] glanced at Xiao Wang, then reached out to pick up the bowl on the table. Xiao Wang listened to [Yang Yinghua]'s slightly mocking words, his eyes staring straight at him.
0:57:11|0:57:33|Two Jiu stood up on one leg, took out his car key from his pocket, and then placed it on the table in front of [Yang Yinghua]. He then picked up a bowl of wine and handed it to [Yang Yinghua], and drank it in one gulp. [Yang Yinghua] and Ma Mei stared at him without saying a word. One day, [Yang Yinghua] was working in the field.
0:57:33|0:57:40|Little Wang ran over from a distance in a hurry, shouting loudly. He ran up to [Yang Yinghua] and smiled as he spoke.
0:58:26|0:58:32|[Yang Yinghua] was planting seedlings in the field, and after a moment of contemplation, he said to Xiao Long.
0:58:37|0:58:50|[Ma Mei] is frying chili noodles in the kitchen, while Xiaonan hangs by the door, watching a basket of chicks. [Yang Yinghua] returns home from the field, hangs his straw hat on the bamboo basket, and then sits on the steps.
0:59:7|0:59:19|Little Pumpkin sat on the floor playing with toys in the room. [Yang Yinghua] walked in, squatted beside him, and wiped his nose with his hand. Then he sat down at the dining table and started complaining to Ma Mei.
0:59:41|0:59:55|He picked up the glass on the table and took a sip. At night, several members of the Yang family received a notice to gather at [Yang Yinghua]'s house. On the other side, Xiao Wang was reporting to the leaders at the village committee.
1:0:43|1:0:49|Little Wang nodded in agreement, while on the other side, [Yang Yinghua] talked to his family.
1:2:30|1:2:41|It's not time to drink water yet. Yang Yinglian is humming aside and gesturing to [Yang Yingjun], "Go call Xiaolong back. I want him to come back."
1:2:52|1:3:5|Yang Yinglian continued to gesture and write with her hands and pen towards Dumb Brother, "You don't go out to work, just wandering around all day, getting drunk." Dumb Brother coldly chuckled and replied.
1:3:23|1:3:37|[Yang Yinghua] realized he was about to lose his temper as he spoke, so he quickly took the water cup from [Ma Mei], took a sip, let out a deep breath, calmed himself down, and continued speaking.
1:4:27|1:4:38|Ma Mei was giving him ideas on the side. Yang Yinghua listened to this and lowered her head.
1:4:40|1:4:50|[Ma Mei] quickly handed the water cup to [Yang Yinghua], who took a sip. Braided man [Yang Lan] looked at the people in front of him and said. [Yang Lan] stood up and was about to leave.
1:5:22|1:5:38|Ma Mei immediately handed the water cup to her husband when she saw him angry. Unexpectedly, Yang Yinghua snatched the cup and threw it in anger, scaring Yang Lan and Dumb Brother to run out quickly. Ma Mei stood up in shock, and Yang Yinghua, seeing this, also hurriedly ran out.
1:5:40|1:6:0|Outside the house, it was pouring rain. After the three of them ran out of [Yang Yinghua]'s house, they didn't care about anything else and immediately ran towards their own homes. Inside the house, [Yang Yinghua] was furious, his eyes staring at a spot, breathing heavily. He turned his head, blinked his eyes, then lowered his head, lost in thought.
1:6:0|1:6:8|Ma Mei slowly walked forward with a water cup in her hand. Instead of comforting her husband who looked helpless, she stood aside quietly watching him.
1:6:10|1:6:19|Early the next morning, the villagers wearing hats arrived at the village committee with sickles in hand. The young people washing at the door quickly caught up.
1:7:32|1:7:40|Okay, Xiao Wang brought his team to the home of [Yang Yinghua].
1:7:46|1:7:48|[Yang Yingjun] looked at the person behind him.
1:8:4|1:8:22|Villager [Yang Yinghua] immediately told Wang Shen that he needed to return to the forest as soon as he heard about being sent to fight. Then he turned around and left. Wang Shen stood in place watching him leave, then turned to look at [Yang Yingjun]'s figure. He then took his straw hat and ran to Yang Yanlian's house.
1:8:22|1:8:33|Yang Yinglian handed her daughter's graduation certificate to Wang Shen, who opened it and looked at it before heading to Yang Jinsan's house. [Yang Jinsan] was sitting on the doorstep of his house.
1:8:37|1:8:59|[Yang Jinsan] looked at him with a self-deprecating smile, then lowered his head. Seeing this, Wang Shen directly stepped over the threshold and entered the room. The room was dark and damp, with two slightly older little girls - one standing at the table picking vegetables, the other squatting on the ground. There was also a child sitting on a mat whose face couldn't be clearly seen. Wang Shen looked elsewhere.
1:9:0|1:9:5|There is a little girl doing her homework at the table, she walks to the door and asks [Yang Jinsan].
1:9:36|1:9:43|[Yang Jin San] listened to his words, with a puzzled expression, asked, while Little Wang was so angry with his actions that he didn't know what to say, and could only stand by in a state of confusion.
1:9:46|1:10:3|Then he arrived at the home of [Yang Lan], only to see [Yang Lan] with his legs crossed, leaning back in a chair and asleep. [Yang Lan] was awakened by Xiao Wang's voice, he opened his eyes and glanced around, his gaze following Xiao Wang's movements.
1:10:3|1:10:13|Wang Shen first looked inside the room next to him through the door curtain, then he looked around the whole house, and said to [Yang Lan].
1:10:32|1:10:45|[Yang Lan] finished speaking and then lay down on the rocking chair to sleep. Xiao Wang looked at him helplessly and had to help clean the house. He took a mop to clean the dust on the floor, and at this time, [Yang Lan] also woke up.
1:11:26|1:11:33|At that moment, Wang Shen and the Yang family were all in Yang Yinghua's house, Ma Mei handed a glass of water to Yang Yinghua.
1:11:45|1:11:47|[Yang Yingjun] heard these words and happily turned to his wife, saying.
1:12:37|1:12:43|Yang Yinghua led everyone to his own field. He walked to the center of two terraces and pointed to one of the fields, saying to everyone.
1:13:29|1:13:32|[Yang Yinghua] looked at him in surprise and asked.
1:14:1|1:14:7|After Yang Weiwei finished speaking with a smile, everyone looked at this piece of land, and [Wang Shen] was the first to speak.
1:14:38|1:14:41|[Yang Yinghua] turned around and looked at him in confusion.
1:14:46|1:14:53|Everyone returned to Yang Yingjun's home and sat down together for a meal. After Yang Yingjun finished speaking, everyone at the table looked at Wang Shen.
1:15:21|1:15:31|[Yang Yingjun] shook his head, and after listening, Little Wang couldn't come up with a specific solution either. Ma Mei was cleaning up the dishes and said.
1:15:43|1:15:51|Ma Mei took small steps to get the rice, while Yang Yinghua took a sip of water and continued speaking.
1:16:43|1:16:52|Ma Mei put a bag of rice into the bamboo basket, then carried a bucket of wine, and finally took out some pickled fish from the earthen jar, asking her husband to take them to [Yang Yinghua].
1:16:54|1:17:13|In the evening, a group of young people who are helping with poverty alleviation are sitting in the village committee, holding a lot of materials and discussing with others, all working to help the villagers out of poverty. Wang Shen sits aside checking the computer, where the map information of Shiba Village appears.
1:17:13|1:17:48|On the other side, [Yang Yinghua] held a large plastic bucket in his hand, squatting next to his own field. He scooped up small fish from the bucket with a ladle and put them into the muddy water where the seedlings were planted. [Yang Yinghua] raised his head with a puzzled look, but still decided to follow him to take a look.
1:17:48|1:17:56|Wang Shen drove his own car with [Yang Yinghua] sitting beside him, passing through the narrow mountain road and a nearby mine.
1:17:59|1:18:13|The car made its way into the empty ground next to the street after the last turn, slowly stopping in the center of the open space with mud covering the body. The two got out of the car to inspect, and [Yang Yinghua] sighed.
1:19:19|1:19:34|He then stood up with the ore in his hand, extended his left arm, and spread his hand to let the ore fall to the ground. After shaking his hand to scatter all the ore, he glanced at Ma Mei beside him, clapped his hands, and left.
1:19:35|1:19:48|Little Wang watched as he walked away, hands on hips, unsure of what to say. After hesitating for a moment, he also left. On the other side, several villagers climbed up the mountain road, looking at several wooden sticks lying across the middle of the road.
1:20:31|1:20:37|[Yang Yinglian] gestured with his hand, indicating [Yang Lan] to give her opinion. [Yang Lan] helplessly said.
1:20:46|1:20:50|[Yang Yinglan] looked at him, then licked his lips and said.
1:20:55|1:21:25|In Luxuhe, where there are many people, [Yang Lan] paused for a few seconds, turned his eyes and pondered for a while, then shook his head and said firmly. After saying that, [Yang Lan] stood up and left. [Yang Lian] watched him leave, then pursed his lips and got up without saying a word.
1:21:27|1:21:43|After the two left, a group of people in the neighborhood committee became lifeless like wilted eggplants, all immersed in silence. At this moment, sitting on the side, [Grandpa] suggested. [Grandpa] said.
1:21:48|1:21:55|They arrived at the doorstep of [Yang Yinglan]'s house, led by the opinionated [Dumb Brother], staring at [Yang Yinglan] sitting against the door lintel.
1:21:57|1:22:3|[Yang Yinglan] kept her eyes tightly closed, clearly not wanting to see the newcomer. At this moment, [Dumb Brother] spoke up.
1:22:21|1:22:26|As soon as the words fell, [Grandpa Gao] standing on the side also sternly shouted.
1:22:28|1:22:41|[Yang Yinglan] looked at the three [uncles] in front of her, then turned her head to look ahead. After a while, [Dumb Brother] standing aside also spoke.
1:22:45|1:23:1|[Yang Yinglan] straightened up after listening, she looked at the expressions of the three [uncles] in front of her, then nodded slightly. After a while, [Yang Yinglan] spoke.
1:23:1|1:23:20|The sky suddenly thundered, the wind howled, and the attacking feathers fluttered in the wind. [Wang Shen] drove with [Yang Yinghua] on the road in the mountains, and soon they returned to the village. [Ma Mei] opened the wine jar and scooped it into the bowl, while [Dumb Brother] played with a plastic car in the room.
1:23:22|1:23:41|Outside the house, it was pouring rain. [Yang Yingjun] stood at the door with his arms crossed in front of his chest, staring silently at a spot outside, lost in his thoughts. He didn't even notice [Little Pumpkin] pressing against him. [Ma Mei] poured the wine from the bowl into a plastic bucket.
1:23:41|1:23:49|At night, the heavy rain finally stopped. [Yang Yinghua] carried a plastic bucket filled with liquor, walking along the village road with Yang Yining.
1:23:52|1:24:13|They walked through narrow paths and finally arrived at the home of [Yang Yinglan]. At that moment, [Yang Yinglan] was watching TV, lying on a worn-out single sofa. The two walked straight into her house, and she didn't speak first. [Yang Yingjun] carried a wine barrel and spoke to [Yang Yinglan].
1:24:13|1:24:35|[Yang Yinglan] walked to the table with a helpless expression after hearing that. Then, he took out two bowls from elsewhere, placed them on the table, and said. After that, he turned off the TV and sat on the nearby stool. [Yang Yingjun] then placed the wine barrel on the table and said.
1:24:42|1:24:49|[Yang Yingjun] tied [Yang Lan] to a chair and roared like a pig being slaughtered, attracting Little Wang on the street.
1:25:6|1:25:21|[Yang Yingnian] stuffed a wad of paper into [Yang Yinglan]'s mouth and then gasped for breath on the side. After they finished this, they were about to leave when they unexpectedly met little [Wang Shen] who was attracted by the calling outside the door. [Yang Yingjun] looked at him and gestured with his hand.
1:25:29|1:25:48|Little [Wang Shen] watched the two leave without saying a word. He stood outside the door for a long time before finally walking towards [Yang Yinglan]'s house. What greeted his eyes was [Yang Yinglan] tied to a chair. Little [Wang Shen] walked up to her, feeling a pang of sympathy at her current state.
1:25:48|1:25:57|Yang Yinglan turned her head to the side, refusing to look at her in anger. Wang Shen remained silent for a moment, then spoke.
1:26:19|1:26:39|Little [Wang Shen] earnestly tried to persuade, but [Yang Lan] listened to him with eyes glaring angrily, wanting to say something viciously. However, the scar on his lips prevented him from speaking a complete sentence. On the other side, as [Yang Yinghua] just returned home, his wife [Ma Mei] approached and asked.
1:26:41|1:26:45|[Yang Yinghua] sat on the stool, clapping the granddaughter's doll in his hand.
1:27:0|1:27:9|The scene shifts to the home of [Yang Yinghua]. At this moment, the scar on his mouth has been removed. Xiao Wang feeds him a sip of wine.
1:27:21|1:27:27|Wang Shen stood still holding a bowl, then he put down the wine bowl and picked up a porcelain doll.
1:27:38|1:28:1|After speaking, his eyes were shining with tears, and his mouth was trembling slightly. [Yang Yinghua] choked up as she spoke about her fears, sitting on a stool and stubbornly turning her head to the side.
1:28:5|1:28:14|Xiao Wang, seeing the situation, did not continue his previous actions. He lowered his head for a moment, then picked up the wine bowl on the table and held it to Yang Yinghua's mouth.
1:28:20|1:28:25|[Yang Yinghua] took a sip of wine and lowered his head. It was already late at night, and the village had fallen into silence.
1:28:27|1:28:43|The next morning came quickly, [Yang Yingjun] set off from home early and arrived at [Yang Yinghua]'s house. [Yang Yinghua] was still tied to the chair just like last night. At this moment, she and [Wang Shen] were both sound asleep in the chairs.
1:28:43|1:28:48|[Yang Yingjun] stepped forward to untie Yang Lan, the faint movement causing Yang Lan to let out a hum in her sleep.
1:28:52|1:29:6|The sound woke up [Wang Shen] who was sleeping on the side. He saw [Yang Yinghua]'s actions and was scared. He kicked away the wine barrel and immediately stood up to stop [Yang Yinghua].
1:29:23|1:29:29|After releasing him, [Yang Yingjun] turned and walked out of the room, leaving [Wang Shen] standing there looking bewildered.
1:29:33|1:29:54|The mist gradually enveloped the sky above the Eighteen Buildings Village. A group of villagers stood in an open space, with a table in the center. On the table, there was a jar of wine, several small bowls for wine, and three wooden sticks in front of the table. Hanging from the sticks was a chicken, and above it was a round, rusty iron object.
1:29:54|1:30:6|The villagers all looked in the same direction, waiting for Yang Yinglan to arrive. After a while, an old man looked at his watch and then said happily.
1:30:11|1:30:23|As soon as these words were spoken, happy smiles appeared on the faces of the surrounding villagers, and they cheered with joy. On the other side, [Wang Shen] and his two companions drove to the enclave they had visited last time.
1:30:26|1:30:48|The vehicle stopped in the center of the enclave, and [Yang Yinghua] immediately got out of the car and shouted. Xiao Wang Wensheng got out of the car immediately, while [Yang Yinghua] stumbled down from the car. He struggled to close the car door, took a few steps, and then collapsed on the hood of the car. [Yang Yinghua] walked up to him.
1:31:29|1:31:43|Ma Yingjun, who was just half asleep, immediately woke up when she saw the open space around her. Ignoring Wang Shen's words, she pushed aside the little Wang in front of her and slowly walked forward, observing the surroundings.
1:31:47|1:31:59|The other two looked puzzled at his lost and confused appearance. [Yang Yinghua] walked aimlessly forward and eventually stopped at a spot. He knelt down, bent over, and picked up a pile of ore slag.
1:32:29|1:32:34|[Yang Yingjun] lay on the ground, regretting deeply, waiting in agony.
1:32:42|1:33:0|[Yang Yinghua] and Xiaolong did not stop, [Yang Yinghua] continued to shout. He choked in pain, punched the ground, and shouted. [Yang Lan] lay on the ground with her head down, crying out in pain.
1:33:13|1:33:33|Kneeling on the ground, [Yang Yinghua] and Wang Shen stood behind him, silently watching everything. On the ground, [Yang Lan] picked up some ore and looked around at the vast barren land. Then, he loudly spoke about his current situation.
1:34:12|1:34:30|[Yang Yinghua] shouted loudly on the slag heap. Then, the three of them drove on the mountain road. Xiao Wang sat in the driver's seat, [Yang Jun] sat in the passenger seat. [Yang Yinghua] was in the back, staring ahead like an eagle. Suddenly, she patted [Yang Jun] in front of her and shouted.
1:34:43|1:35:2|Shi Youcheng walked ahead of his fellow workers. As soon as he saw someone approaching, he quickly turned and ran back. Little [Wang Shen] and the other two followed suit, while the workers stood still, watching the scene unfold. The four of them chased each other along a road with the words "Eternal Light in the Well" written on the periphery.
1:35:2|1:35:12|Due to his age, [Yang Yinghua] fell behind and Shi Youcheng couldn't run anymore, so he stood still and raised his hand in surrender. [Yang Lan] stepped forward and grabbed his shoulder.
1:35:26|1:35:35|[Yang Yingjun] panted behind, as the scene shifted, the sky was gradually darkening, and little [Wang Shen]'s car was driving on the mountain road back to the village.
1:35:37|1:35:52|[Yang Yinglian] squats at home, blowing into a bamboo tube, and a thick smoke rises instantly. Little [Yang Weiwei], her daughter, stands at the door watching, then timidly calls out.
1:35:52|1:36:3|[Yang Yinglian] heard a sound, paused for a moment, stopped what she was doing, turned her head to look towards the door. Little [Yang Weiwei], with a backpack on her back, leaned against the door frame and looked at her.
1:36:4|1:36:9|Shi Youcheng is holding two buckets of wine as he walks to the door.
1:36:10|1:36:17|[Yang Yinglian] stared straight at the two of them, not saying a word. The slightly trembling corners of her mouth indicated the unrest in her heart at this moment.
1:36:20|1:36:31|The two children stood at the door, hesitant to enter. [Yang Yinghua] looked at them, tears welling up in her eyes. At that moment, little [Yang Weiwei] walked in from the doorway, causing [Yang Yinghua] to burst into tears of joy.
1:36:57|1:37:10|Shi Youcheng entered the room with wine, getting [Yang Yinglian] drunk. At night, the villagers all came to [Yang Yinglian]'s house, sitting around the table with wine in hand, each with a smile on their faces.
1:37:10|1:37:17|Shi Youcheng held a wine barrel, while little [Yang Weiwei] carried a water jar to refill everyone's drinks, filling the room with a joyful atmosphere.
1:37:23|1:37:32|The lively sound reached the village committee, a group of young men curiously looking towards the source. After a while, one young man said.
1:38:3|1:38:13|Yang Ying's home is still lively, with everyone opening up their hearts, singing and drinking. On the other side, [Yang Yingjun] sits in his own chair, humming a tune.
1:38:32|1:38:45|[Ma Mei] sat at the door and heard a noise, she turned to smile at her husband, then looked into the distance, her mind went back to when her son left home. At that time, she looked at the stool on the beam and said.
1:39:9|1:39:13|[Ma Mei] looked awkwardly at her husband, and her son looked up and said.
1:39:30|1:39:38|The son expressed his thoughts expressionlessly, and [Ma Mei], upon hearing this, looked at him with a blank expression and ultimately said nothing.
1:39:42|1:39:55|Father and son carried a ladder to remove the stool on the beam. [Ma Mei] sat in the dark, watching quietly. Tears glistened in her eyes, and the firelight flickered on her face.
1:39:55|1:40:3|[Yang Yingjun] took the stool down and wiped it with a cloth, while her son sat in front of her silently watching. Several certificates were still hanging on the wall behind them.
1:40:7|1:40:29|[Ma Mei] watched this scene, feeling deeply upset, tears streaming down her face. She silently cried on the side, wiping away the tears, three neatly arranged stools in a row. The next morning came quickly, her son carrying the three tied stools left the village. He walked along the small path in the mountains.
1:40:31|1:40:50|[Yang Yinghua] stood there with a plastic sheet draped over him and a straw hat on his head. His eyes were fixed on the direction his son was leaving, his expression unable to hide the emotions, tears glistening in his eyes. In the end, he couldn't even say a word to his son.
1:40:50|1:40:58|The scene cuts back to reality, with [Yang Yinghua] sitting in a chair, staring blankly at a spot, lost in thought.
1:41:2|1:41:15|Late at night, the villagers all came out of [Yang Yinghua]'s house and headed towards their own homes. The lights were still on in the room, with [Yang Weiwei] sitting inside, giving instructions to Shi Youcheng.
1:42:3|1:42:10|The next morning, Shi Youcheng scooped up a bowl of water to drink from the well at the village entrance. [Yang Yinghua] said.
1:42:28|1:42:42|[Yang Weiwei] shared her thoughts, and both [Yang Yinghua] and his wife smiled with relief. At that moment, Little Pumpkin suddenly ran over and hugged Shi Youcheng. Mommy quickly went forward to pick up Little Pumpkin.
1:42:54|1:43:15|[Ma Mei] held Little Pumpkin and smiled as she answered Little Weiwei's question. [Yang Yinghua] sat on the side, arms crossed in front of his chest, nodding in agreement. The people in the room nodded and smiled slightly after hearing this, except for [Yang Yinghua] who sat with a bitter expression, creating an awkward atmosphere in the room.
1:43:15|1:43:18|Finally, [Ma Mei] indulgently tapped the tip of Little Pumpkin's nose with her finger.
1:43:21|1:43:51|The Yang family arrived at the slag heap, wearing straw hats and carrying baskets of soil to fill the land. Yang Jinsan poured the soil from the basket onto the ground, looking at the empty mining land with a sigh. Yang Yinghua joked that in Yang Jinsan's home, a little girl sat at the door reading aloud from a book.
1:44:9|1:44:17|The daughters looked at her in astonishment upon hearing these words. On the mountain road, a tricycle was carrying a woman with a smile on her face.
1:44:47|1:44:55|[Yang Jinshan] arrived at the doorstep at this moment. [Yang Jinshan]'s wife came back from outside and brought gifts for their four daughters.
1:45:10|1:45:24|She watched her husband happily holding a hoe, feeling genuinely happy in her heart. Finally, she no longer needed to work outside to support the family.
1:45:24|1:45:39|The men of the [Yang family] placed the bamboo baskets on the ground, holding hoes and shovels to fill the baskets with soil. Then they carried the baskets filled with soil to the side of a small truck, emptied the soil into the back of the truck, and repeated this process back and forth until the truck was full.
1:45:43|1:46:1|The group sat on a truck filled with soil, driving towards the slag heap. Along the way, they looked at the scenery without any communication, but their faces showed a sense of fulfillment and tranquility. Upon reaching the destination, they got off the truck, filled the soil on the slag heap, and then returned to the original location.
1:46:1|1:46:8|At night, [Yang Yinghua], along with two others, went to the well at the village entrance, scooping up the accumulated water to wash away the fatigue of the day.
1:46:14|1:46:27|One day, [Ma Mei] carried a bamboo basket with a little pumpkin inside, climbed up the long steps, and arrived at the home of [Yang Yinghua]. She processed the small fish one by one and put them into a wooden barrel. Little [Yang Weiwei] was beside her.
1:46:44|1:46:52|Little Pumpkin was wandering aimlessly outside the door with a bamboo basket, and [Ma Mei] felt relieved when she saw it. Little [Weiwei] followed suit.
1:47:13|1:47:32|Little [Weiwei] was stunned by these words, feeling uneasy as she looked at [Ma Mei]. In another room, Little Pumpkin had already crossed the threshold alone. She opened her arms and skipped through the room where the adults were, heading towards the depths of the woods on her own.
1:47:32|1:47:37|While busy in the room, [Ma Mei] and little [Weiwei] didn't notice where Little Pumpkin had gone.
1:47:42|1:47:46|The two put the cooked fish into a clay pot.
1:47:58|1:48:9|In another room, there was no sound at all. [Ma Mei] felt that something was wrong and quickly went out to check. But there was no sign of Little Pumpkin in the room.
1:48:19|1:48:36|Little [Weiwei] first calmed down [Ma Mei], then ran to the back of the house to look around, only to find no sign of Little Pumpkin anywhere, causing her to panic. [Ma Mei] went down the steps to go home and search, while Little [Weiwei] went up the steps to look for a phone.
1:48:42|1:48:59|Ma Mei stumbled all the way to the house. She crossed the threshold of the door, pushed open the door of the room with both hands, walked silently towards the inside of the room, her eyes scanning every corner, but still did not hear Little Magnolia's declaration. Anxiously, she quickly turned back, ran to the door, and leaned her hands on the door.
1:49:7|1:49:22|And at this moment, Little Pumpkin had already happily bounced into an environment surrounded by grass and tall trees. It watched the little insects flying in front of it, chasing after them while grabbing with its hands. As it walked, it arrived at the edge of a cliff that was a hundred meters high.
1:49:24|1:49:40|Little Pumpkin was completely unaware of the danger, just blindly following the little bug. He stopped at the edge of the cliff, reaching out his hands towards the bugs around. He happily hopped around, all his attention focused on catching bugs. When he was having fun, he even joyfully shouted out.
1:50:18|1:50:38|[Yang Weiwei] and [Ma Mei] were shouting Pumpkin's name loudly in the woods, and the villagers started helping them search. As [Ma Mei] searched, she felt a wave of despair, she looked up at the sun, and continued searching.
1:50:38|1:50:56|[Yang Weiwei] was sweating profusely in the sunlight, anxiously searching for Xiaonangua's figure. Suddenly, she heard a faint sound behind her. She quickly turned around and saw Xiaonangua's figure in the grass. Bending down, she watched Xiaonangua standing at the edge of the cliff, her heart racing.
1:51:1|1:51:19|[Yang Weiwei] widened her eyes, as if rooted to the spot. At this moment, [Ma Mei] and the villagers appeared behind her. Seeing the dangerous situation, [Ma Mei] immediately moved forward. [Yang Weiwei] opened her arms directly to stop her, then placed her index finger by her lips, making a gesture for silence.
1:51:19|1:51:26|The two held hands and slowly walked towards Little Pumpkin. The villagers followed behind them slowly.
1:51:33|1:51:48|They tried to make as little noise as possible as they walked lightly towards the edge of the cliff. Little Pumpkin was still playing there happily, [Ma Mei] and Yang Weiwei grabbed Little Pumpkin's body and fell backwards.
1:52:38|1:52:52|It was drizzling under the sky, and Little Pumpkin was brought back home by [Ma Mei]. [Yang Yinghua] sat at the door holding his granddaughter, facing [Ma Mei] who was sitting opposite him, both sharing their inner thoughts with Little Pumpkin. Little Pumpkin laughed happily after listening.
1:52:55|1:53:16|The scene shifts, with Wang Shen and the men from the Yang family working in the fields. Their clothes are covered in mud, but not a single person stops their actions, all continuously digging in the soil. Yang Yinghua and her son-in-law Shi Youcheng are shoveling soil into bamboo baskets. Yang Yanlan and Yang Jinsan are also working hard.
1:53:16|1:53:33|Little Wang continued to bend over and wave the shovel to work. After filling multiple bamboo baskets, they poured the soil onto the truck, and several people sat on the truck with dirt on their faces. When they arrived at the destination, they got off the truck and poured the soil onto the slag heap.
1:53:33|1:53:40|In the evening, Wang Shen followed [Yang Yinghua] back home, and the two sat at the table eating and chatting.
1:55:24|1:55:30|[Yang Yingjun] looked at Wang Shen in surprise, but Wang Shen didn't pay attention and continued speaking.
1:56:32|1:56:35|Wang Shen finished speaking and lowered his head. He picked up the wine bowl on the table and took a sip. Yang Yinghua and Ma Mei sat opposite him, silently watching him.
1:57:42|1:58:2|In a simple and persistent manner, Xiao Wang confides his and his father's story to [Yang Yinghua]. It is only now that he understands his father's good intentions and regrets not being able to rush back to see him one last time.
1:58:4|1:58:23|Warm tears flowed from his eyes, and he lifted his glasses to wipe the tears from his face. [Ma Mei] was infected by him, also quietly wiping away tears on the side. As time passed, it came to dusk. [Yang Yinghua] sat on a chair, sighing.
1:58:55|1:59:0|[Ma Mei] handed a cup of water to [Yang Yinghua], who took it and smiled at Xiao Wang.
1:59:19|1:59:29|[Ma Mei] looked at the stool on the beam as [Wang Shen] spoke, and [Yang Yinghua] followed his gaze. One morning, a message began to play on the village's radio.
2:0:41|2:0:54|[Ma Mei] is making small fish at home. She puts the finished product into a clay pot, adds salted chili, then pours in water. After finishing, she covers the lid and adds a basin of water around the lid.
2:1:6|2:1:22|[Poverty Alleviation Leader] stood between the blackboards in the village committee house, explaining the future development plan of the village to a few villagers. The room was bustling with people coming and going, and staff members took down quilts from the rafters to hand over to the young people returning to the village.
2:1:22|2:1:28|Some villagers stood beside the old lady weaving and embroidering, while the children played and frolicked in the room.
2:1:33|2:1:55|In the village, a meeting is being held with women holding drumsticks to beat the drum. Villagers from other villages arrive at Shiba Village in their best attire. [Yang Yinghua] stands at the lively meeting, watching the newcomers. At that moment, a woman walks past her, talking to her friend. [Yang Yinghua]'s gaze immediately follows her.
2:1:55|2:2:17|When the woman walked out of her sight, she remembered to chase after her. In the bustling village crowded with outsiders, [Yang Yinghua] searched for the woman's figure but couldn't find her. She anxiously looked around in the crowd, and suddenly caught a glimpse of the woman she fell in love with at first sight.
2:2:17|2:2:25|She quietly approached behind the woman and tapped her foot with her toe. The woman turned around and made eye contact with [Yang Yinghua], and both of them shyly smiled.
2:2:32|2:2:42|A small passenger van drove up, with three stools tied on top of the vehicle, indicating that the [Yang Yinghua] family was about to reunite.
