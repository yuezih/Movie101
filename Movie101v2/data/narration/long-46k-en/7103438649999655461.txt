0:0:22|0:0:28|Night falls, and the entire town seems to be asleep. Looking around, only the houses in the center of the town are still lit up.
0:0:29|0:0:44|On the signboard on the roof it reads "Heaven on Earth", on the terrace the singer is showing graceful dance moves, at the entrance, [Old K] is escorting a man to see off the guests.
0:1:9|0:1:28|A chubby man is sitting outside, gossiping with a group of dusty women. A young man carrying a bag and dressed as a farmer walks by. The young man arrives at a snack street, watching Five Dalang blowing pancakes, climbing the lotus seed island and other small vendors, feeling nervous. At this moment, a loud shout behind him makes him turn around.
0:1:30|0:1:48|A person in night clothes leaped from the second floor of the human world. After rolling in the air for a few rounds, he landed on the roof behind Xiao Shangfan, and then smoothly rolled to the ground. Then, he sat on the ground and hid behind the coffin lying on the ground.
0:1:48|0:1:54|As soon as he turned around, he was shot in the forehead with a gun and fell to the ground.
0:2:20|0:2:26|Welcome, the soldiers raised their guns and fired, carving a word on the coffin just now - "death".
0:2:26|0:2:41|The scene zooms in on the characters on the coffin, officially starting the movie. It tells the story of the early Republic of China, in the city of [Hong Tao] where all kinds of people gather. Listen carefully, being able to work in Master Wang's factory is the result of your ancestors' virtues, it's a great blessing.
0:3:21|0:3:40|As soon as he finished speaking, the door behind him opened, and a woman walked out wearing a tight cheongsam with a high slit, holding an oil-paper umbrella. Following her was a short wealthy man. The man who had just been talking big quickly slapped himself and changed his tune,
0:3:45|0:4:5|The man couldn't finish his words, so he quickly stood aside. The wife held an oiled paper umbrella for the master and walked slowly towards the courtyard, while the master sat expressionless on the boss chair in the center of the courtyard. The wife disdainfully looked at the first interviewee, then sharply rolled her eyes before walking up to the second interviewee.
0:4:5|0:4:23|Approaching the third interviewee with a look of disdain on his face, [Wang Damao] walked briskly while holding his nose. After a contemptuous glance, he then moved on to the fourth interviewee. He scrutinized the young man in front of him, who met his gaze with determination. After a few words, it was only then that the lady slowly began to speak.
0:4:26|0:4:34|After speaking, she turned and walked towards [Old K] with a swaying posture. Once she stood still, she spoke to [Old K] who was sitting in the boss chair.
0:4:36|0:4:54|Old K listened to his wife's words without expression, slowly took out an old deck of cards from his sleeve. He looked at the young man who came for an interview, then used the small table in front of him as a pivot point to skillfully shuffle the cards with different techniques.
0:4:54|0:5:2|Finally, after shuffling the cards in hand, [Old K] slowly raised the Ace of Hearts, facing the interviewees in front of him, and then spoke.
0:5:4|0:5:19|After speaking, he scattered the playing cards into the air, and for a moment, the sky was filled with scattered playing cards. The crooked-mouthed man looked foolishly at the falling cards, while [Old K] closed his eyes and enjoyed it all. The interviewees stood still in amazement.
0:5:20|0:5:34|One of the interviewees looked at a [Fang Pian] in front of him with a determined look, as if he had a plan. Mrs. Liu looked solemnly at the scattered replica cards, unaware that one card had already fallen on her chest.
0:5:34|0:5:48|With everyone's gaze, [Mrs. Liu] also realized something was wrong and looked towards her chest. Seeing this, the interviewees all crazily reached out towards her. [Mrs. Liu] watched as these people ran towards her, frightened, and quickly stepped back, only to twist her foot and fall backwards.
0:5:48|0:6:2|The oil lamp in his hand was thrown into the air due to weightlessness. Just as his body was about to touch the ground, a pair of strong hands caught him. [Mrs. Liu] looked in horror at the ground just inches away, then turned to look at the man who caught her.
0:6:2|0:6:16|The man is the fourth interviewee he just praised as not bad. The fourth interviewee used his mouth to pick up the card at Mrs. Liu's chest, which is the Ace of Hearts that can be left behind. Old K also seemed to sense it at this moment, suddenly opening his eyes.
0:6:23|0:6:29|[Old K] led [Shun Zi] to a courtyard. Then he spoke to the person guarding the house.
0:6:49|0:7:7|But then he thought of something and turned to instruct. After [Old K] left, [Shun Zi] quietly opened the door of Mrs. Er's room, walked in, and then very cautiously turned around to close the door. To his surprise, as soon as he turned his head, a pair of scissors was placed horizontally on his neck. He opened his mouth in shock and said.
0:7:7|0:7:25|Upon hearing the voice, Er Second Madam looked at [Shun Zi] in front of her and couldn't help but shed tears. The two of them were overwhelmed with joy, embraced each other, and Er Second Madam spoke. After a brief embrace, [Shun Zi] pulled away from Er Second Madam and asked.
0:7:30|0:7:37|[Chun Tian] choked up when talking about his father, and his once bright and lively eyes became dull and lifeless.
0:7:37|0:7:56|On the day of the incident, [Chun Tian]'s father sat in the audience, playing the pipa with his eyes closed, while [Chun Tian], dressed in elegant dance attire, danced at the intersection of the stairs. His jade-like hands gracefully moved, his watery eyes deep and serene. Just as he was immersed in it, the sound of the pipa suddenly stopped, and he looked up.
0:8:15|0:8:25|He sat in the chair, his hand still reaching out to [Chun Tian] who was kneeling on the ground. As the father passed away, [Chun Tian] knelt in front of the grave. At this moment, Lord Cat led his men forward and spoke.
0:8:41|0:8:45|After listening to all that Chun Tian had recounted, Shun Ze calmly asked.
0:8:56|0:8:59|[Shun Zi] placed both hands on [Chun Tian]'s shoulders, comforting him.
0:9:4|0:9:10|He embraced [Chun Tian] and calmly considered his countermeasures. On the other side, [Wang Damao] exclaimed in surprise.
0:9:27|0:9:49|Upon hearing this, [Hong Tao] exclaimed in disbelief. After expressing her emotions, [Hong Tao] got up and walked towards the door, followed closely by [Wang Damao], who shouted after her. Watching [Chun Tian] walk away, [Wang Damao] said, "..."
0:9:55|0:9:57|[Shun Zi] hurriedly grabbed [Wang Damao] and said.
0:10:7|0:10:11|[Shun Zi] imitated [Wang Damao]'s voice and then said.
0:10:18|0:10:23|[Wang Damao] looked at [Shun Zi] in surprise. Then he said thoughtfully.
0:10:24|0:10:33|On the other side, [Hong Tao] is in the room wearing a gorgeous cheongsam, holding a glass of red wine, and asking with a mysterious look, "What do you think?"
0:10:43|0:10:45|The man with a crooked mouth, bare-chested, smiled and answered.
0:10:54|0:10:56|The crooked-mouthed man said with a lecherous look.
0:11:0|0:11:6|After speaking, he winked at [Wang Damao], and this little flirt came over.
0:11:11|0:11:17|[Wang Damao] said fiercely, as the crooked-mouthed man walked up behind her and placed a hand on her shoulder to comfort her.
0:11:22|0:11:27|Upon hearing this, [Wang Damao]'s expression softened and he smiled at the crooked-mouthed man.
0:11:32|0:11:54|Speak up, [Wang Damao] turned his body, leaning lightly on the table, while the crooked-mouthed man hurriedly approached to show loyalty. [Wang Damao] pushed the crooked-mouthed man away with his hand, then lifted his foot against the crooked-mouthed man's chest. Just then, the door of the room was suddenly opened, [Old K] with a drooping face, hands behind his back, walked in from outside and asked.
0:11:55|0:11:58|At this moment, there was no sign of Wang Damao in the room.
0:12:4|0:12:18|[Hong Tao] finished speaking and turned to leave. [Wang Damao] immediately changed his expression, looking sorrowful as he got up from the table and left the room. The crooked-mouthed man then peeked out from under the table, looking terrified.
0:12:18|0:12:32|On the other side, [Shun Zi] entered the room where the commoners were resting with a bag on his back. He looked at the row of men sleeping on the kang and sat silently on a chair. Unexpectedly, the commoners who were just asleep suddenly surrounded him and asked.
0:12:36|0:12:43|Shun Zi turned around in fright, he quickly lit the oil lamp, but Wang Damao earnestly advised him.
0:13:18|0:13:27|The next day, [Wang Damao] sat in the courtyard watching the [commoners] work, while [the man with a crooked mouth] held a watermelon and attentively spoke to [Hong Tao].
0:13:28|0:13:35|[Hong Tao] smiled slightly, shyly took the watermelon handed over by [Old K], and then impatiently handed the watermelon to [Wang Damao].
0:13:37|0:13:43|[Wang Damao] took the watermelon from [Hong Tao] and then handed it to [Chun Tian] standing next to him.
0:13:45|0:13:50|Shun Zi watched all this in the yard, and Chun Tian ended up smashing the watermelon into the ground nearby.
0:13:53|0:14:8|Still pushing the millstone, [Shun Zi] saw [Chun Tian]'s actions and smiled foolishly at [Chun Tian]. Unexpectedly, [Hong Tao], seeing [Shun Zi]'s smile, blinked in surprise, thinking she was showing interest in him, and immediately shyly threw a flirtatious glance at her.
0:14:8|0:14:11|And [Shun Zi], upon seeing this, grimaced and started working.
0:14:18|0:14:30|He pretended his eyes were uncomfortable, leaning towards [Wang Damao]. As night fell, two night lights were hung at the gate of the Wang family courtyard, and the guards were all asleep on the ground. [Wang Damao] and [Hong Tao] were also fast asleep in the room.
0:14:30|0:14:46|In the mediocre room, the crooked man and a group of mediocre people have also entered dreamland, with only [Shun Zi]'s bed empty. In the deep night, [Shun Zi] secretly takes [Chun Tian] with him, but unexpectedly, Wang Damao suddenly sits up from the bed as if he had a premonition.
0:14:53|0:15:3|After speaking, Lord Wang lifted the blanket, got up and walked out of the room. [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] were running in the courtyard, about to step over the threshold, but suddenly stopped.
0:15:32|0:15:44|The two hurriedly passed by [Wang Damao] and quickly headed towards the door. Suddenly, [Wang Damao] called out to them, both of them paused, then turned around slowly to look at him, even calmly asking.
0:15:50|0:16:4|Wang Damao finished speaking and walked towards the door on his own. Shun Zi and Chun Tian followed behind him. He slowly turned around to face the two. Feeling nervous, Shun Zi gathered up the courage to ask.
0:16:26|0:16:38|The crooked-mouthed man stopped Wang Damao. Wang Damao looked down at her chest and bellyband. When they arrived at the grave, Wang Damao's master knelt down and wept bitterly.
0:16:49|0:16:53|The crying abruptly stopped, and Old Master Wang Damao turned to look at Wang Damao and the crooked-mouthed man.
0:17:13|0:17:28|He looked at [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] again. [Chun Tian] only looked elsewhere. Mr. [Wang Damao], who wanted to make a statement, couldn't help but ask.
0:17:28|0:17:45|As dawn broke, everyone returned to the mansion. [Shun Zi] was grinding on a millstone in the courtyard, sweating profusely. [Wang Damao] walked over with a wooden bucket, his eyes fixed on [Shun Zi]. After a while, [Wang Damao] slyly hummed, causing [Shun Zi] to stop his work and bow to him.
0:18:6|0:18:14|[Shun Zi] lowered her head and dared not look at him, while [Wang Damao] blushed and turned to walk towards the bathhouse.
0:18:16|0:18:31|After speaking, she swayed into the bathhouse, and [Shun Zi] looked up with a gloomy face, then left the courtyard. Inside the bathhouse, [Wang Damao] sat in a wooden tub, pouting, hunching her back, lifting her legs to the edge of the tub, and rubbing her feet in an inelegant posture.
0:18:31|0:18:39|Just as she was washing vigorously, the door slowly opened. [Wang Damao], with her back to the door, stopped her movements, twisted her body slightly, and shyly said.
0:18:52|0:19:6|Thinking it was [Shun Zi] who had arrived, but turning around to find two useless people from home, [Wang Damao] angrily threw a towel at them. Putting on clothes, [Wang Damao] walked arrogantly into [Chun Tian]'s room, not even acknowledging [Shun Zi] when he greeted her.
0:19:6|0:19:13|She walked sharply towards the room, seeing Wang Damao sitting next to Chun Tian, as Old Mrs. swayed her body and spoke.
0:19:47|0:19:58|Night falls, Wang Damao lies on a large dining table with only a pair of boxers on. His right leg is bent, left leg resting on the right one, one foot raised high, as if waiting for someone to arrive.
0:19:58|0:20:15|In the courtyard, [Shun Zi] sneaked up to the wall, cautiously looking around before quickly walking to a room door. He stopped in front of the door, knocked on it, and it opened to reveal [Chun Tian]. The two of them walked cautiously towards the main gate.
0:20:16|0:20:31|Who knew at this moment [Wang Damao] also walked out from the door, leisurely shaking her fan, but saw [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] trying to escape, and quickly went forward to stop them. [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] stood still, only to hear [Wang Damao] saying again.
0:20:47|0:21:6|The two turned to go to the kitchen, but heard [Wang Damao] shouting again. [Wang Damao] pushed open the kitchen door, with [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] following. The three of them saw the scene inside the room and stood still. When the butler [Fang Pian] saw the newcomers, he immediately stood up and raised his arms up.
0:21:6|0:21:8|Shun Zi looked at him like this and asked.
0:21:14|0:21:41|[Wang Damao] looked around with a helpless expression and walked towards the dining table. [Chun Tian] followed closely behind, while the butler [Fang Pian] looked at the two with a lecherous expression. Soon, the two sat down at the table with [Shun Zi] standing by the side. [Wang Damao] awkwardly asked a question, and the butler [Fang Pian] hesitantly replied.
0:21:59|0:22:4|Several people stood up to leave, but unexpectedly, [Wang Damao] entered the room and looked at them, saying.
0:22:26|0:22:38|Mrs. Wang finished speaking and walked out of the room, followed closely by [Chun Tian]. After Shun Zi finished speaking, he also left the room. At this moment, the only person left in the room was the butler [Fang Pian] sitting at the dining table in his underwear.
0:22:49|0:22:52|[Fang Pian] the butler confronts [Shun Zi] at the table.
0:23:20|0:23:28|He pulled out the knife stuck in the table, glared fiercely at the person opposite him, and pushed the knife out.
0:23:45|0:23:59|The housekeeper snorted coldly, then stood up from his seat and walked over to [Shun Zi]. Next, he picked up a piece of paper from the table and casually picked up a brush, writing two words on the paper. He looked up at [Shun Zi] and handed him the brush.
0:23:59|0:24:8|Shun Zi gestured to borrow a brush, then wrote the characters for Wang Damao on the paper. The two looked at each other, when suddenly, the door was opened by someone.
0:24:13|0:24:29|The newcomer is the protagonist on paper, and both [Shun Zi] and [Fang Pian] quickly turned around to try to tear back what was just written, only to be stopped by [Wang Damao]. [Wang Damao] leisurely walked up to the two, with [Fang Pian] and [Shun Zi] staring at him, their faces full of sweat from nervousness.
0:24:29|0:24:34|Wang Damao looked at the two of them on guard, expressionlessly picked up the paper on the table and glanced at it.
0:24:35|0:24:39|Suddenly, he frowned and looked at [Fang Pian] and [Shun Zi].
0:24:59|0:25:16|[Wang Damao] smiled happily, nodded at [Fang Pian], and quickly left the room after getting permission from [Fang Pian]. He closed the door, leaned against the wall, and limped out of the courtyard.
0:25:39|0:25:54|[Wang Damao] crumpled the paper he had just written on and threw it aside, then took out a new piece of paper and a pen. Just as he was about to start writing, he suddenly paused, turned his head, and asked [Shun Zi] beside him.
0:25:54|0:26:2|[Shun Zi] took the pen from [Wang Damao] and wrote on the paper as requested. After finishing, [Shun Zi] handed the pen back to [Wang Damao].
0:26:14|0:26:21|As soon as the voice fell, the door was opened, and [Wang Damao] walked in slowly from outside, looking at the two and asking.
0:26:24|0:26:27|[Shun Zi] turned to [Wang Damao] for help.
0:26:29|0:26:45|After Wang Damao finished speaking, he turned to Shun Zi and gestured for him to dispose of the contents on the paper, then left the room. The landlady watched Wang Damao leave, then stared sharply at Shun Zi, who tried to remain calm and stared back at her.
0:26:45|0:26:51|Mrs. Wang Damao walked up to [Shun Zi] and met his defiant gaze, causing him to lower his head in submission.
0:26:53|0:27:4|[Shun Zi] looked at Mrs. Wang with his eyes, but his hand secretly tried to take the paper from the table. Unexpectedly, he was stopped by Mrs. Wang, who took the paper from his hand and read it. It said "I love Mrs. Wang."
0:27:20|0:27:26|Mrs. Wang smiled and neatly folded the paper, then tucked it into her chest. [Shun Zi] explained with a smile.
0:27:36|0:27:46|Mrs. Wang Damao spun around, with Shun Zi placing one hand on her shoulder and the other around her waist. The two of them looked at each other with smiles, creating a beautiful scene like a painting, full of warmth.
0:28:19|0:28:37|Mrs. Wang finished speaking, looking up at [Shun Zi] with a smile, and [Shun Zi] also looked at him with an inscrutable smile on his face. The record player on the table played melodious music, and a pair of hands opened the drawer in front of the table. Inside, the person took out the arsenic from the drawer, and then closed the drawer.
0:29:0|0:29:12|[Shun Zi] took the noodles, knocked on the door of [Wang Damao]'s room, walked to the desk with the noodles in his hands, then bent down and placed the noodles steadily on [Wang Damao]'s desk. He straightened up slightly and said.
0:29:15|0:29:18|[Wang Damao] stared silently at [Shun Zi], saying nothing.
0:29:28|0:29:41|[Shun Zi] carried a plate of noodles laced with arsenic that had been tampered with twice by [Wang Damao] into the room of the old lady. She placed the plate on the table in the room, but almost blew her cover as soon as she spoke.
0:29:43|0:29:48|Mrs. Wang Damao exclaimed in surprise. Shun Zi hesitated for a moment and quickly tried to make up for it.
0:29:48|0:30:6|Mrs. Wang's face immediately lit up with a smile upon hearing this. She set down the comb in her hand, then opened a drawer under the dressing table and took out a small porcelain jar of poison. With a smile, she placed it next to her face, showing it to [Shun Zi]. She stood up, holding the jar of poison, and walked to the table.
0:30:14|0:30:30|At the dining table, [Wang Damao] sat at the head. Sitting on both sides were the big lady and the butler [Fang Pian], each with a bowl of noodles in front of them. The three of them stared at the noodles in silence, while [Shun Zi] stood by indifferently. The three of them sat at the table with their own secrets.
0:30:30|0:30:34|[Wang Damao] first looked at [Fang Pian], then turned to look at [Hong Tao].
0:30:35|0:30:46|Wang Damao, Hong Tao, and Fang Pian all looked at Shun Zi at the same time, but Shun Zi turned his head aside, indicating that he did not want to get involved in their grievances. None of them dared to act rashly. Unable to bear the atmosphere, Wang Damao turned to Old K and said.
0:30:49|0:30:59|Master, Wang Damao did not move his chopsticks after listening, but turned his head thoughtfully towards Hong Tao, then said.
0:31:7|0:31:25|Wang Damao's gaze shifted from Mrs. Da to a bowl of noodles on the table. He picked up the chopsticks and noodles, but showed no intention of eating. Instead, he turned the conversation towards Fang Butler. Wang Damao placed the noodles in front of Fang Butler, who forced a smile.
0:31:30|0:31:46|[Fang Butler] couldn't maintain the fake smile on his face after hearing this. He watched as [Wang Damao] turned his head to look at the noodles on the table. After a while, he picked up the noodles and chopsticks, while [Shun Zi] and [Mrs. Damao], who knew the truth, nervously swallowed their saliva while watching [Fang Butler]'s actions.
0:31:55|0:32:8|[Fang Butler] opened his mouth, about to put the noodles in, but stopped when he heard the words. [Fang Butler] then looked at her gratefully, while [Wang Damao] and [Shun Zi] both watched to see what [Mrs. Wang] would do next.
0:32:24|0:32:41|[Wang Damao] and Mrs. Wang forced [Fang Butler] to eat noodles. [Fang Butler] looked at their serious faces, then lowered his head to look at the noodles in his hand. With determination, he was about to put the noodles into his mouth when suddenly gunshots were heard outside the door, startling everyone. All eyes turned towards the door, where two soldiers were standing with rifles.
0:32:55|0:33:10|[Wang Damao], [Fang Pian], and [Shun Zi] walked over. The old lady was hiding behind the wall. The shorter soldier finished speaking, looked at the three in front of him, and then walked up to [Wang Damao] and asked.
0:33:19|0:33:37|Soldier Jia asked Shun Zi, who nodded. Soldier Jia then asked Fang Pian and received a satisfactory answer. Soldier Jia then looked at Wang Damao and asked. Due to his ignorance, Wang Damao received a slap from Soldier Jia.
0:33:41|0:34:0|Ai Guanbing walked up to [Shun Zi] and asked. Then he strolled over to [Wang Damao] and prepared to question. After listening to [Wang Damao]'s words, Ai Guanbing walked up to [Shun Zi] and asked.
0:34:22|0:34:32|The short official asked the three people. [Wang Damao] and [Fang Pian] each took a step back, while the short official looked at [Shun Zi] who was standing still in front of him.
0:35:8|0:35:17|After speaking, the two soldiers walked towards the door, while the steward sent the guests off obsequiously. Madam Wang watched everything behind the wall, and Shun Zi immediately knelt down upon hearing Wang Damao's words.
0:35:21|0:35:33|Just as [Wang Damao] raised his hand to hit [Shun Zi], the soldier who had just left kicked the door open and came back. The short soldier asked [Shun Zi].
0:35:48|0:35:55|Two soldiers chased after Wang Damao and arrived at the mess hall. After a brief chase, they both stared blankly at the three bowls of noodles on the table.
0:35:55|0:36:7|The soldiers put down their guns and sat at the table. [Shun Zi], the steward, and Mrs. Wang Damao all came to the kitchen. They watched as the soldiers started to eat noodles and couldn't help but shout, startling the soldiers.
0:36:17|0:36:31|The soldiers were stunned by this roar, they didn't listen to persuasion at all. They picked up their bowls and ate. The old lady raised her hand and made a three gesture.
0:36:31|0:36:54|Two soldiers faced each other, after speaking, they picked up the noodles and prepared to eat. The soldiers aimed their guns at them, [Wang Damao] and the others were scared stiff and didn't dare to move. The soldiers then picked up bowls and ate the noodles heartily, and when they finished, they prepared to leave. The group bowed to the soldiers.
0:37:2|0:37:14|As the two soldiers had not even left the gate, the poison took effect. They suddenly knelt down on the ground, convulsing uncontrollably. [Wang Damao] and the others bowed halfway, quickly approaching to check on them. [Shun Zi] leaned in to check the soldiers' breathing and said.
0:37:55|0:38:0|After Shun Zi finished speaking, Wang Damao and Fang Pian turned to look behind them, only to find other servants from the house.
0:38:3|0:38:24|Servants holding torches, [Wang Damao] and others looked at each other in silence. When morning came, [Wang Damao] hurriedly packed a few pieces of clothing, account books, and several silver dollars into a bundle, planning to run away. Just as he stepped out of the door, he froze in place, seeing [Fang Pian], [Shun Zi], the mistress, and [Chun Tian] standing at the doorway. Seeing his reaction, [Shun Zi] spoke up.
0:38:43|0:38:52|The words were weighty and profound, [Fang Pian] and [Shun Zi] helplessly lowered their heads, while the old lady and [Chun Tian] looked disdainful.
0:39:4|0:39:10|[Shun Zi] turned his head and glanced at the big lady next to him, who twisted her body with a look of disdain.
0:39:39|0:39:44|Madam Wang interrupted Wang Damao unhappily, and Wang Damao approached her solemnly.
0:39:57|0:40:3|[Fang Butler] hesitated for a moment, lowered his head, and [Wang Damao] walked towards the door with his luggage on his back, followed by the other four.
0:40:15|0:40:34|[Fang Butler] hesitated for a moment before shouting out, and when [Wang Damao] heard it, he stopped in his tracks and turned to look at him. At that moment, [Fang Butler] hurried over to stand in front of [Wang Damao], and the two of them gazed at each other. After a while, [Fang Pian] Butler spoke up. He reached out to straighten [Wang Damao]'s clothes, and said with a heartache.
0:40:41|0:40:46|Fang Pian's steward's words are touching, but Wang Damao is ungrateful.
0:40:46|0:41:2|[Wang Damao] finished scolding the steward [Fang Pian], then turned and walked towards the door. But as soon as he reached the door, it was kicked open, and a gun was pointed at [Wang Damao]. He had to slowly step back as two soldiers entered from outside, and one of them asked him.
0:42:0|0:42:7|With these words, the soldiers looked at them in disbelief. [Wang Damao] replied.
0:42:25|0:42:45|The soldiers received a satisfactory answer and turned to leave. To their surprise, they saw the fat lady leaning against the wall, and the two of them asked in a lewd manner. The fat lady hesitated and said, "[Fang Pian] the steward is standing by with a blue face," and the soldiers asked [Chun Tian] again.
0:42:50|0:43:14|After speaking, the soldiers walked towards [Chun Tian]. [Shun Zi] stopped the soldiers and stood in front of them. The soldiers looked at [Chun Tian], then looked at [Shun Zi] with confusion, and then asked.
0:43:18|0:43:27|The two soldiers looked at each other, then turned to the uneasy Chun Tian, while the landlady watched from the side. Unexpectedly, the soldiers then shifted their gaze to her, raising their eyebrows slightly.
0:43:42|0:44:1|Mrs. Wang snorted coldly after hearing this, swaying her body as she walked into the house. Meanwhile, [Fang Pian], the steward, watched this scene from behind the wall, feeling very angry. He disappeared from the scene for some reason. Two soldiers held guns to threaten as Mrs. Wang entered the room. When she walked to the bedside, Mrs. Wang suddenly turned to look at them.
0:44:20|0:44:26|Two soldiers saw Mrs. Wang like this, both put down their guns and looked at each other, then walked towards Mrs. Wang.
0:44:33|0:44:46|The soldiers turned their heads in confusion, not knowing when the big lady appeared next to [Fang Pian] the steward. Fang Pian embraced the big lady and blew her a kiss, while [Wang Damao] watched from outside, his mouth twitching in anger.
0:44:48|0:45:0|Two soldiers watched the situation and joined forces to grab their guns. [Fang Pian] immediately pushed the big lady in his arms away, took a kitchen knife and tried to chop off the hands of the two soldiers who were about to grab the guns, but was rushed by the soldiers.
0:45:0|0:45:9|Next, [Fang Butler] angrily took a kitchen knife and chopped towards the faces of the soldiers, then towards the middle of the two, followed by chopping towards their crotch and waist.
0:45:10|0:45:23|The soldiers dodged one after another, and finally found the right moment to kick [Fang Pian] in the waist, sending him flying. Despite being knocked down, [Fang Pian] didn't bother to check his injuries, immediately picked up the kitchen knife beside him, stood up, and started slashing towards the soldiers.
0:45:23|0:45:30|Who knew, as soon as he turned around, he froze in place and dared not move, while the two soldiers had already aimed their guns at [Fang Pian]'s crotch.
0:45:40|0:45:51|Two soldiers rushed out of the door, while on the other side, Shun Zi and Chun Tian had already run out of the village. Wang Damao and others also followed out of Wang's house. The soldiers went out of the door, looked around, and said.
0:45:51|0:45:57|The soldiers rushed to chase after the fugitives, and [Wang Damao] and others in the house also ran out to join the team pursuing [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian].
0:46:3|0:46:14|[Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] ran into the woods, with a large group of people chasing after them. The soldiers couldn't hold back and fired two shots at them.
0:46:14|0:46:33|The soldiers followed all the way to the snack street next to the human heaven, passing by Pan Jinlianzi Island and four strangely dressed vendors. The four vendors stared at them maliciously, and after the soldiers left, they rolled their eyes and left the stall. [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] also peeked out from behind the stall.
0:47:30|0:47:41|[Wang Damao] led the ordinary people into the human world from heaven, and then gave orders. With a command from [Wang Damao], the ordinary people ran in different directions to search. [Shun Zi] followed [Chun Tian] to the room where he used to live.
0:47:49|0:48:3|[Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] looked at each other, then [Shun Zi] tiptoed over to the edge, slowly picked up [Chun Tian]'s father's qin, and the two of them planned to leave quickly. But just as they were about to go downstairs, they saw [Wang Damao] looking for someone downstairs.
0:48:7|0:48:20|[Wang Damao] and the servants went upstairs together, even entering a room with [Chun Tian], then quickly closing the door and running towards the room. Afterwards, [Wang Damao] and the others opened the door and walked into the room in a grand manner.
0:48:29|0:48:45|Several people rushed forward and began beating the two people on the bed. While [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] tried to escape in the chaos, suddenly a gunshot rang out, startling everyone present. They saw a smoking hole in someone's back, then [Old K] emerged from under the blanket and shouted loudly.
0:48:52|0:49:0|The girls all ran out from heaven and earth, with [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] taking advantage of the chaos to run away. [Wang Damao] and the others followed behind, relentlessly chasing after them.
0:49:5|0:49:13|[Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] were exhausted and couldn't run anymore, so they gave up escaping and rested in place. [Wang Damao] and the others caught up and were panting on the side.
0:49:32|0:49:49|At this moment, [Wang Damao] in Dawang Village was still unaware of the seriousness of the situation. He sat at the head of the room with the mistress, while [Fang Pian], the steward, stood beside them. After a while, [Wang Damao] began to interrogate the captured [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian].
0:50:7|0:50:13|The steward [Fang Pian] and the mistress, who were just arrogant, suddenly became timid and slapped the table in anger at [Wang Damao].
0:50:34|0:50:44|Mrs. Damao said defiantly. Wang Damao lifted up Fang Pian's sneaky face with his hand and said.
0:50:55|0:50:59|[Wang Damao] flicked the steward [Fang Pian]'s face with his hand, sat up straight, and addressed everyone.
0:51:18|0:51:22|[Wang Damao] turned around and looked at the people in the room, then spoke.
0:51:27|0:51:42|He bent down and looked at the kneeling butler [Fang Pian], then said ominously. After hearing this, the butler [Fang Pian] collapsed on the ground.
0:51:47|0:51:52|[Wang Damao] glanced at the old lady, then took a few steps forward and spoke to [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian].
0:52:36|0:52:43|[Wang Damao] kicked the steward of [Fang Pian] to the ground, while [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] were talking in the corner.
0:53:17|0:53:35|The soldiers kicked open the door of Wang's mansion, then a large number of soldiers entered the mansion. At the end of the team, two soldiers were escorted, and the deputy officer in the middle shouted. [Shun Zi] dressed in a luxurious robe walked at the front, followed by [Wang Damao] and others. The deputy officer looked at them and asked.
0:53:54|0:53:56|The soldiers who had been to Wang's house before pointed at [Shun Zi].
0:54:1|0:54:7|[Shun Zi] looked at the deputy firmly, and the deputy walked up to him, patting his shoulder, saying.
0:54:18|0:54:36|[Shun Zi] was about to be taken away by the soldiers, when [Chun Tian] stepped forward and called out to him. Upon hearing this, [Shun Zi] turned around to look at [Chun Tian], who then ran towards him without hesitation. The two embraced tightly in front of everyone, as if this farewell was a final one.
0:54:36|0:54:42|Wang Damao looked at the scene in front of him with a pale face and lowered his head, while the steward of [Fang Pian] shook his head with a look of regret.
0:54:43|0:54:47|The two embracing figures create a picture of exquisite beauty and sorrow.
0:54:59|0:55:15|Step back from the embrace of [Chun Tian], [Shun Zi] decisively turns and leaves. Soon after, a large number of soldiers also leave Wang's residence. [Chun Tian] stands in place, tears in her eyes as she watches [Shun Zi] walk away. Little did she know, not long after [Shun Zi] and the soldiers left, [Wang Damao], like many others, started to have sinister thoughts.
0:55:26|0:55:46|At night, in a mansion guarded by many soldiers, there is a tiger chained in the center of the courtyard. Across from him, a man stands in a cell enduring the whip lashes. On the other side, [Wang Damao] sits in front of a room with the character for "happiness" on it, drinking. About to enter the bridal chamber, he laughs joyfully.
0:55:46|0:56:1|The servants in the house were all bare-chested and silent. [Chun Tian] was in the room, playing the pipa as if going to his death. As the sound of the pipa stopped, in another room, the man who had been beaten raised his head, revealing himself to be the leader of all the soldiers, [Old K].
0:56:28|0:56:31|Old K and Shun Zi kneel down together facing the gun barrels.
0:56:33|0:56:49|[Old K] slammed the wine in front of him, and [Shun Zi] turned his head in confusion and asked him, General.
0:57:11|0:57:24|The servants stood bare-armed in the courtyard of [Wang Damao]'s mansion. [Wang Damao] sat in the center of the courtyard, listening to [Fang Pian] the steward talk about the dowry sent by everyone. Inside the house, Mrs. Liu poured the gold embroidered cloth into the wine while cursing.
0:57:36|0:57:44|[Chun Tian] is dressed in festive attire, kneeling in front of her father's pipa and crying. Outside the door, [Wang Damao] is still immersed in the joy of his new marriage.
0:58:19|0:58:32|A large number of soldiers rushed into Wang Damao's house, with the deputy officer leading Shun Zi in with a smile, looking at the "happiness" characters posted everywhere in the courtyard. Fang Pian's steward quickly stepped forward and bowed to the deputy officer.
0:58:36|0:58:38|The deputy officer looked at [Shun Zi] in surprise.
0:58:42|0:59:4|The deputy officer, after hearing the steward [Fang Pian]'s words, suddenly turned his head towards [Wang Damao]. He walked steadily with sharp eyes to stand in front of him, then bent down to stare at him and asked.
0:59:17|0:59:30|The steward of [Fang Pian] was startled by these words, the deputy looked at the crowd in the yard, pointing at [Shun Zi]. Everyone looked in the direction the deputy was pointing without saying a word. The deputy impatiently shouted, "That's right."
1:0:0|1:0:8|[Wang Damao] objected, and the deputy immediately threatened. [Wang Damao], under the deputy's authority, had no choice but to agree.
1:0:13|1:0:18|The deputy's gaze turned to the wine glass on the table, he picked it up and asked [Wang Damao].
1:0:23|1:0:29|Taking up the wine glass and finishing it in one gulp, Mrs. Wang was stunned by his boldness.
1:0:46|1:0:53|[Fang Pian] the steward led the deputy and two soldiers to the backyard, while the deputy whispered instructions to his subordinates as they walked.
1:1:46|1:1:57|[Wang Damao] stopped [Shun Zi] who wanted to confess, then walked to his side and paused for a moment. He took two more steps, glanced outside the door, and finally stood in front of [Shun Zi], looking anxious, and said.
1:1:59|1:2:4|Next, [Wang Damao] turned to the lady of the house and the servants at home and said.
1:2:19|1:2:26|Mrs. Wang wanted to retort, but after a moment's thought, she shyly and hesitantly said.
1:2:26|1:2:42|Mrs. Data finished speaking, shyly shook her fan and twisted her waist as she left the room. [Wang Damao] looked at her in confusion. In the backyard house, [Chun Tian], who had been rescued, lay on a fainting bed. She woke up groggily and, upon opening her eyes, found three people in military uniforms in front of her, causing her to sit up in shock.
1:2:58|1:3:6|Shun Tian was pinned down by soldiers in the room where Wang Damao and Shun Zi were. Hearing someone calling his name, he turned to look.
1:3:8|1:3:13|[Chun Tian] pushed away [Chun Tian]'s hand and then put his arm around his shoulder, walking towards Soldier Jia.
1:3:41|1:3:47|Chun Tian looked at the soldiers in front of him and immediately understood Shun Zi's intention, then reluctantly hugged him and said.
1:4:12|1:4:15|[Chun Tian] leans on Shengzi's shoulder and talks to him.
1:4:27|1:4:37|The deputy officer was outside the house, fighting a battle. His body was overheated, and even fanning himself didn't work. He had to resort to hitting the wall to relieve himself. Suddenly, he realized that the liquor he drank today was not right.
1:4:44|1:5:1|As soon as the words fell, [Mrs. Wang] walked past with her arms bare and wearing a bra top. The adjutant's eyes stared straight at [Mrs. Wang]'s back, and he secretly leered at her from behind until his face turned red. He stopped, still looking in the direction she left, his lips trembling slightly.
1:5:1|1:5:17|The hand holding the fan naturally hangs down. Coincidentally, a funny scene appears on the ground, with the shadow of the fan perfectly imprinted on her crotch, while [Wang Damao] is sitting cross-legged on the bed in a bad mood. [Mrs. Damao] walks towards her, fanning the fan, and asks with concern.
1:5:38|1:5:58|The deputy officer who entered the room saw this scene and his nose started bleeding. The scene shifted, [Shun Zi] sat at the main seat with a furrowed brow. He turned to look at the deputy officer sitting next to him with a nosebleed, and the deputy officer continued to shout after sniffing. He sat on the chair and continued slowly.
1:6:4|1:6:9|The deputy officer pulled out a pistol and handed it to [Shun Zi] with a sharp look.
1:6:11|1:6:21|[Shun Zi] picked up the gun on the table and aimed it directly at the kneeling [Wang Damao], but unexpectedly turned the gun towards the deputy, startling everyone.
1:7:1|1:7:15|[Wang Damao] was sweating profusely as he pulled the wood, while the steward [Fang Pian] stood by with a smile. Finally, he collapsed in tears on the ground and fell asleep. Just as he was about to enter the wooden box, someone spoke up and woke him up.
1:7:15|1:7:22|He woke up from his sleep, raised his head and looked at the newcomer with a bewildered expression, only to see that Xianxian Yu was holding a steamed bun and handing it to him.
1:7:24|1:7:31|[Wang Damao] looked at the steamed bun in front of him, swallowed, then picked it up with both hands and said, looking up.
1:7:35|1:7:39|[Chun Tian], dressed in luxury, slowly squatted down and said.
1:8:1|1:8:4|Chun Tian pushes away Wang Damao's hand and says.
1:8:38|1:8:53|[Wang Damao] spoke heartfelt words to [Chun Tian], promising to give him a good life. Unaware that he had been tricked, he believed that his hidden wealth couldn't be found by anyone, but on that very day, [Shun Zi] received the news and had it dug up.
1:8:53|1:8:59|[Shun Zi] divides the money among the poor servants who have long been exploited by [Wang Damao], allowing them to take the money back and live a better life.
1:9:0|1:9:17|Night falls, [Hong Tao] dressed in gorgeous clothes and a bright robe, sneaks out of her room. She looks around cautiously, then quietly makes her way to the kitchen. Swiftly, she opens the door and steps inside, carefully closing it behind her.
1:9:18|1:9:35|When making sure that no one was watching, [Wang Damao] turned his head to look at the person in the room. He saw [Fang Pian], the housekeeper, shirtless with a long bell hanging around his neck, wearing large shorts, and a hat on his head, facing away from [Hong Tao]. Her head slightly lowered, one hand holding the hat, while the other hand naturally hung down in a fixed posture.
1:9:35|1:9:52|At this moment, the vinyl record player started playing music. She threw her hat off directly and began to dance to the music. [Hong Tao] watched her dancing figure and started moving her body along. The butler [Fang Pian] turned around to look at [Hong Tao] and winked at her.
1:9:52|1:10:9|[Hong Tao] stood with one hand on her waist, the other hand lightly brushing past her own mouth in a seductive gesture, while [Fang Pian] the butler excitedly swung a long bell. [Hong Tao] also tossed her hat in the air and beckoned with a finger. Then, the two climbed onto the dining table and started moving towards the center from opposite sides.
1:10:9|1:10:28|As they climbed and made gestures to seduce each other, just as the two were about to get close, suddenly a pistol appeared in front of them. The deputy head, wearing the hat that [Wang Damao] had just thrown, exclaimed in shock.
1:11:4|1:11:10|The deputy officer cut a cucumber with a knife on the spot, causing [Fang Pian] to scream in fear. The next day, the soldiers reported to the deputy officer.
1:11:23|1:11:27|The deputy drank the wine in the bowl and then rinsed the bowl on the table.
1:11:33|1:11:38|The scene cuts to [Old K] glaring fiercely at [Shun Zi], gritting his teeth.
1:12:1|1:12:24|[Wang Damao] and [Fang Pian] were talking face to face, with the distressed [Fang Pian] looking down at his crotch, tears streaming down his face. [Wang Damao] crawled towards [Fang Pian] on the ground, and the two of them discussed rebellion with difficulty.
1:12:41|1:12:52|The two of them reached an agreement and looked in the same direction, their faces one thin and one round, forming a contrast like immortal clouds at this moment. They saw that the focus of their gaze was a curved chopping knife.
1:13:1|1:13:15|[Old K] points a gun at [Shun Zi]. At this moment, [Wang Damao] and [Fang Pian] burst into the room with curved knives in hand. Seeing the situation, the two immediately kneel down and offer up the curved knives with both hands.
1:13:58|1:14:9|[Old K] menacingly threatened [Wang Damao] and [Shun Zi], as he had rigged a fist-sized landmine on the ceiling beam and tied [Shun Zi] and [Wang Damao] to pillars on either side of the landmine.
1:14:9|1:14:17|As the fuse of the landmine was lit, [Wang Damao] became more and more anxious. In the moment before the landmine was about to explode, he gasped for breath, screamed, and closed his eyes.
1:14:18|1:14:27|With a half-hearted roar, the imagined explosion did not occur. [Wang Damao] and [Shun Zi] opened their eyes to see the burning fuse in front of them, while the landmine remained unharmed.
1:15:10|1:15:16|[Fang Pian's butler] nodded in agreement, watched as [Wang Damao] left, then turned his eyes and stared fixedly at [Shun Zi].
1:15:40|1:15:53|[Shun Zi] was tied to a beam in the courtyard by the steward [Fang Pian], while the mistress [Hong Tao] was dressed in a blue and white porcelain cheongsam, draped in a short silk cape, holding a sharp knife in her hand. She walked towards the two with a determined gaze, her elegant embroidered hair swaying gently in the breeze.
1:16:55|1:17:4|The furious [Fang Pian steward], disregarding everything, fiercely competes for the dagger in the hands of the mistress, intending to use it to kill [Shun Zi] and end the recent absurd feud.
1:17:4|1:17:18|The devoted love of Shun Zi and Chun Tian deeply moved Mrs. Wang Damao, who also exerted all her efforts to protect the love she longed for but never had. As they struggled in the courtyard, unexpectedly, a moment of carelessness led to the dagger piercing into Hong Tao's body.
1:17:18|1:17:31|Housekeeper Fang gazed blankly at the wound on [Hong Tao], where the flowing blood carried away not only Mrs. Hong's life, but also her vitality. Mrs. Hong lay limp in Housekeeper Fang's arms.
1:18:7|1:18:10|Shun Zi frowned and sighed as she watched this scene.
1:18:25|1:18:35|With the butler's roar, the scene shifts to the Wang family ancestral tomb. Unexpectedly, the bodies of two soldiers who died from poisoning are found there.
1:19:4|1:19:13|He then walked slowly towards the bed with a serious expression. [Old K] and his men raised their guns, vigilantly following behind [Wang Damao].
1:19:13|1:19:28|Approaching the bed, [Wang Damao] hesitated for a moment, as if making a firm decision. Suddenly, he pulled back the bed curtain and took out a rifle from the dark drawer beside the bed, screaming as he turned and aimed at [Old K]. The soldiers present were shocked into silence by this sudden turn of events.
1:19:29|1:19:36|Seeing the man in front of him, sweating profusely and unable to stop panting, Old K knew that the desperate [Wang Damao] was capable of anything.
1:20:40|1:20:49|Following Shun Zi's memories, the scene cuts to the moment when Fang Pian's steward swung the knife towards himself. As the knife was swung, his arm froze in mid-air.
1:20:58|1:21:12|Turning to the gate, we saw that the other servants of [Wang Damao] were bare-chested, each holding tools in their hands such as shovels, sickles, hammers, and wooden sticks. Seeing this scene, the steward took a short knife and walked towards them.
1:21:12|1:21:18|On ordinary days, the servants who usually bow and scrape before him now face his fierce gaze without fear.
1:21:32|1:21:42|Rushing out of the room, Wang Damao stopped in front of Shun Zi. He looked to both sides and found that everyone was shirtless and holding weapons.
1:21:43|1:22:1|They gathered in large numbers, with a fierce momentum behind [Shun Zi]. [Wang Damao] was frightened by this formation, silently retreating backwards. Seeing the timid [Wang Damao] in front of him, [Shun Zi] glared angrily and continued to approach him. The mediocre people behind him also followed step by step, moving forward, feeling the overwhelming momentum in front of them.
1:22:1|1:22:10|Fearless [Shun Zi] and the ordinary people, [Wang Damao] trembled as he raised the rifle above his head and then knelt down in submission. Seeing this scene, [Old K] inside the house shouted angrily.
1:22:12|1:22:32|Old K gave a command, and his men around him immediately raised their long spears to block the door, forming a barrier in front of Old K in an instant. Facing such a serious formation, Shun Zi showed no fear on his face, but instead calmly crossed his hands in front of his chest.
1:22:32|1:22:47|The gaze of [Old K] was fixed on, although he was holding a gun, he dared not act rashly, only to confront each other. [Chun Tian] was on top of a tall building, watching the scene in front of him, and also playing the pipa. This music made the already tense confrontation even more severe.
1:22:48|1:22:58|At this moment, the servants blocking the door dispersed to the sides, creating a passage in the middle. [Old K] squinted and saw that the newcomer was none other than the [Fang Pian butler] with his upper body bare.
1:22:58|1:23:9|Wearing a top hat and holding a grenade the size of a head in his hand, he swaggered confidently towards [Old K]. In the sunlight, his figure appeared particularly imposing.
1:23:10|1:23:25|He walked slowly towards [Wang Damao], facing everyone's gaze, and casually tossed his hat aside. Under the watchful eyes of [Old K], he placed the landmine in his hand on the head of [Wang Damao] who was kneeling on the ground. Seeing this scene, the already defeated [Wang Damao] was even more frightened and dared not move.
1:23:25|1:23:33|[Fang Pian's butler] placed the landmine carefully, then casually stretched and warmed up by the side. He flexed his wrist, then bent down to touch the ground with both hands.
1:23:34|1:23:49|Next, he stood up straight, clapped his hands, and shouted, picking up a landmine from the head of [Wang Damao]. In full view of everyone, [Fang Pian] the butler, without any fear, aimed several long guns at himself, and like throwing a thousand balls, threw the landmine towards [Old K].
1:23:50|1:24:2|Just as the landmine was still rolling in the air, Shun Zi acted swiftly and kicked the gun on Wang Damao's head into the air. Then, after flipping in the air a few times, he skillfully caught the gun.
1:24:2|1:24:11|[Shun Zi], like a sharpshooter, actually pulled the trigger, aimed, and fired in one fell swoop as soon as he landed, accurately shooting a bullet towards the flying landmine.
1:24:12|1:24:29|The bullets chased the landmine in the air, and when the landmine reached in front of [Old K], the bullets behind also hit it just right. Amid the screams of Old K and his many henchmen, the landmine was detonated. With the explosion of the landmine, it also heralded the victory of the people led by [Chun Tian].
1:24:29|1:24:38|After going through numerous hardships, they finally defeated the foreign powers, and a proud expression gradually appeared on their faces.
