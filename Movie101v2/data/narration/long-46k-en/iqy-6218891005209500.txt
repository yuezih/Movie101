0:1:20|0:1:37|Drunk and passed out, [Ou Yang] fell off the sofa. In the folk music bar "With You in My Life", [Ou Yang] sat on the stage playing the guitar and singing, with middle-aged people around his age sitting below.
0:2:7|0:2:13|Ou Yang's earphones emitted a piercing sound. Ou Yang took the earphones out of his ears, and the audience below excitedly stood up.
0:2:23|0:2:35|[Ou Yang] took off his sunglasses and walked off the stage, holding a bottle of wine as he approached Yuan Jing sitting in the sofa area.
0:2:42|0:2:44|Yuan Jing took out a business card from her pocket.
0:3:13|0:3:17|[Ou Yang] puts the business card into the pocket on his chest and fills the wine glass.
0:4:0|0:4:4|Ou Yang picks up the wine glass and drinks it all in one gulp.
0:4:29|0:4:34|Many people in this school have lofty ideals, perhaps in the political field.
0:4:40|0:4:45|In the charming alley corridor, the young [Ou Yang] framed himself in a picture frame, throwing flirtatious glances at passing girls.
0:5:8|0:5:13|[Ou Yang] rode his bike through the campus, with [Meng Yifei] catching up. [Wang Xiaochuan] caught up and started playing around with them.
0:5:27|0:5:42|[Wang Xiaochuan] was reading a book, watching a play, and winning a chess game. Hao Zhiwei stood on the roadside with glasses, waiting for [Ou Yang] to pick him up. At that time, the ratio of male to female students in the school was unbalanced.
0:6:10|0:6:19|They four are holding fake tickets painted by [Ou Yang] for the art performance, getting ready to enter. The ticket inspector is at the entrance.
0:6:25|0:6:40|[Meng Yifei] and [Wang Xiaochuan] nervously passed the ticket check. A classmate came up to chat with [Ou Yang]. Hao Zhiwei managed to sneak in, while [Ou Yang] was stopped at the door and left angrily.
0:6:58|0:7:18|[Ou Yang] left carelessly with the business card given by Chen Xiaobin. A girl happened to pass by him, and the two collided. In an instant, [Ou Yang]'s world was enveloped by the bright sunlight, and the title "Always With You 2019" appeared on the screen.
0:7:28|0:7:42|[Ou Yang] pushed his bicycle to the back window of the auditorium, stood on the back seat of the bicycle, climbed through the window into the auditorium. Hao Zhiwei and [Wang Xiaochuan] were whispering to each other.
0:7:52|0:8:5|The singing performance made the audience burst into laughter, and [Ou Yang] ran over to pat [Meng Yifei] on the shoulder. They saved a seat for [Ou Yang].
0:8:44|0:9:4|[Ou Yang] clapped his hands while looking around. As he turned his head, his gaze was caught by the girl on the stage. He stared intently at the girl in a white dress on the stage. Beside him, [Meng Yifei] and [Ou Yang] were competing to use binoculars to look at the girl on the stage.
0:9:13|0:9:27|[Ou Yang] immersed herself in it with a joyful smile, everything around seemed unrelated to her. In her eyes, there was only the girl on the stage with long black hair, wearing a white dress, and a bright smile.
0:10:13|0:10:28|[Ou Yang] took out a cigarette and put it in his mouth, but couldn't find a lighter. Yuan Jing took out her own lighter and lit it for him.
0:10:52|0:11:10|The scene shifts back in time, with [Fang Yao] performing on stage. At the drama club's recruitment event, [Ou Yang] is also seen pushing through the crowded room to hastily fill out the registration form with money.
0:11:15|0:11:20|They found that the other three roommates were also there, and they arrived at a small restaurant.
0:11:40|0:11:45|Mr. Li greeted them and gathered them in a small circle to brainstorm ideas.
0:12:21|0:12:49|The four of them raised their hands one after another, using all their skills. During the day, Hao Zhiwei disguised himself as a fortune teller and stopped [Fang Yao]. [Wang Xiaochuan] pretended to bump into her. [Meng Yifei] tampered with the bicycle, preparing to play the hero. [Wang Xiaochuan] backed out halfway, pretending to study English.
0:13:8|0:13:25|Meng Yifei's plan was disrupted by Fang Yao, making Meng Yifei furious. Ou Yang came to the art club and hesitated outside the door. Just as he gathered his courage to knock, the door opened from inside and President Li walked out.
0:13:25|0:13:30|[Ou Yang] was forced to be the model for the art club, with President Li guiding him on how to pose.
0:13:35|0:13:41|[Ou Yang] adjusts his posture with his upper body half naked, while his lower body is wrapped in a gray scarf.
0:13:50|0:13:57|President Li reached out to grab the veil, but [Ou Yang] held on tightly. In the moment the veil was torn off, [Fang Yao] pushed the door open.
0:13:59|0:14:7|[Ou Yang]'s plan ended in failure, but he was not ready to give up. He asked Chen Xiaobin, who had previously helped him draw bus passes, for assistance. [Ou Yang] grabbed Chen Xiaobin tightly.
0:14:49|0:14:59|[Ou Yang] walked away with a guitar, while students in the cafeteria were protesting. One student explained the situation to [Ou Yang], and [Wang Xiaochuan] stepped out from the crowd.
0:15:26|0:15:29|[Ou Yang] pushed through the crowd to offer help.
0:15:31|0:15:39|The guitar in hand smashed through the glass of the lunch window, leaving the lunch chef stunned in place. [Ou Yang] pretended to be calm, turned back to look at [Fang Yao], stood up straight and said.
0:16:22|0:16:36|[Ou Yang] walked with a guitar on his back, followed by [Fang Yao], along the path in the campus. He wanted to turn around and start a conversation, but lacked the courage.
0:17:28|0:17:30|Chen Xiaobin was chased by a group of girls.
0:17:43|0:18:3|In the dormitory, Ou Yang's photography friends are still planning. Ou Yang comes back and puts the guitar with Fang Yao's BPG number written on it on the table. The other three look at each other with faces full of disbelief, while Ou Yang looks at them smugly.
0:18:7|0:18:21|The next day, [Ou Yang] held a guitar and confronted the band from Wei Ming Lake in front of the trial hall at Shuimu University with the three people from the dormitory. Chen Xiaobin stood in the middle to mediate, and [Ou Yang] spoke first.
0:18:35|0:18:40|[Ou Yang] is ready to start the battle, but Hao Zhiwei stops him. [Ou Yang] shakes him off, while Hao Zhiwei grabs his hand.
0:19:8|0:19:30|They took out playing cards, with the wall behind them covered in posters of the gambling god. [Ou Yang] as the representative of Shuimu University and Wei Minghu's band faced off. Chen Xiaobin dealt the cards, with the other three teammates of both sides standing behind them cheering. Each of them first received two cards, with both sides wearing confident expressions on their faces.
0:19:30|0:19:42|In the end, Wei Minghu's band revealed all five cards. Ou Yang and his group left triumphantly with guitars on their backs, while the band behind them, Wei Minghu's band, discovered something fishy. Ou Yang, [Meng Yifei], and [Wang Xiaochuan] arrived at a public telephone booth.
0:20:8|0:20:11|[Wang Xiaochuan] said unwillingly.
0:20:20|0:20:28|[Meng Yifei] mocked him, the phone rang, and Ou Yang answered it nervously.
0:20:29|0:20:45|I am Ou Yang, dedicating a song to you. Wang Xiaochuan holds the microphone, Meng Yifei turns on the prepared recorder. Ou Yang pretends to play the guitar rhythmically, singing into the microphone.
0:21:13|0:21:26|[Meng Yifei] suddenly turned off the recorder. Ou Yang looked towards [Meng Yifei], while [Fang Yao] walked over holding the drama club's costumes. [Fang Yao] approached.
0:21:34|0:21:38|Back in the dormitory, Ou Yang brought out a book on quick guitar learning methods and started to diligently study the guitar.
0:22:8|0:22:10|Meng Yifei was instantly attracted, interrupted by [Fang Yao] walking over.
0:22:53|0:22:56|[Ou Yang] pulls Meng Yifei away and grabs [Lei Lei]'s hand.
0:23:9|0:23:14|That day, I answered the phone, and [Ou Yang] seemed a bit embarrassed.
0:23:20|0:23:26|Back in the dormitory, [Ou Yang] was practicing the guitar, while Meng Yifei was singing along passionately with a pillow in her arms.
0:23:37|0:23:41|[Wang Xiaochuan] and Hao Zhiwei couldn't stand it, so they both plugged their ears, while [Meng Yifei] patted [Ou Yang] on the shoulder.
0:23:52|0:23:59|[Ou Yang]'s fingers were scratched by the strings. The next day, he wrapped his fingers in layers of gauze and arrived at the performance hall, surprising [Fang Yao].
0:24:42|0:24:45|As they were about to leave, a classmate ran over.
0:24:51|0:24:55|[Ou Yang] and Meng Yifei both raised their hands, reminded by [Fang Yao].
0:25:6|0:25:8|On stage, [Ou Yang] was slapped.
0:25:16|0:25:20|[Lei Lei] kept slapping [Ou Yang] in the face one after another, until the director called cut.
0:25:43|0:25:49|The props team brought the prop fan onto the stage. Lei Lei was a bit worried, and Meng Yifei came running out of breath.
0:26:8|0:26:30|[Ou Yang] looked delighted, [Meng Yifei] ran towards [Lei Lei]. [Fang Yao] stared at the rockery, feeling a bit scared. [Ou Yang] looked at her with concern. In the evening, [Ou Yang] and [Fang Yao] strolled on the campus.
0:27:0|0:27:13|[Ou Yang] smiled bitterly, looking up to see a poster of the 5th Beijing Campus Original Song Competition on the wall below the dormitory building. He and [Fang Yao] walked over.
0:27:17|0:27:35|[Ou Yang] looked at [Fang Yao] thoughtfully as a new day began. The sunlight shone through the lush green trees on campus, where a group of people gathered on the path. [Ou Yang] and [Meng Yifei] squeezed through to see what was happening, only to find that it was a performance by the Minghu Band. They immediately turned around to leave.
0:28:28|0:28:30|Ou Yang is stopped by [Meng Yifei] despite his foolishness.
0:28:48|0:28:59|The performance of Wei Minghu band ended, provocatively looking at [Ou Yang]. [Ou Yang] pretentiously picked up the guitar.
0:29:9|0:29:20|Suddenly he turned and saw [Fang Yao] in the crowd, looking disappointed. The drama club's performance officially began, with [Ou Yang] hiding backstage watching [Fang Yao] on stage.
0:29:35|0:29:55|Lei Lei was crying bitterly in the audience. Ou Yang was getting ready to go on stage backstage. The director was explaining the scene to Fang Yao. Ou Yang remembered what Lei Lei had said before.
0:30:0|0:30:22|The final scene is about to be performed. [Fang Yao] looks up at the tall artificial mountain with fear, she gathers her courage and climbs up. The props team has laid out mats under the artificial mountain, [Ou Yang] watches [Fang Yao] with concern, [Fang Yao] trembles all over and cannot stand up.
0:30:24|0:30:37|A hand behind pulled Fang Yao down. The curtain rises, Ou Yang wearing a wig and the same outfit as Fang Yao, replaces her standing on the high artificial mountain.
0:30:37|0:30:43|At this moment, [Fang Yao] standing behind the scenes noticed a large gap in the protective pad and urgently waved to [Ou Yang].
0:30:50|0:31:18|The music on the scene drowned out his voice, [Ou Yang] nodded at him. [Ou Yang] leaped and jumped off the artificial hill, the audience below unaware, applauding for him. The big wooden board was pulled up, and [Ou Yang] was taken to the medical room. [Fang Yao] stayed by [Ou Yang]'s side, and [Ou Yang] grabbed [Fang Yao]'s hand tightly.
0:31:32|0:31:42|[Ou Yang] only then realized that he was holding [Fang Yao]'s hand and quickly let go. That night, the four of them had supper at a barbecue restaurant. After drinking too much, [Ou Yang] stood up.
0:31:46|0:32:3|[Ou Yang] started to study guitar seriously, preparing to participate in the country music competition. He practiced hard, always carrying his guitar around and playing it constantly. Gradually, his roommates no longer found his playing unbearable and took out the tissues they had stuffed in their ears.
0:32:3|0:32:26|Classmates in the same dormitory also opened their windows to appreciate his performance, applauding and cheering for him. [Meng Yifei] and his two friends were also inspired by him and developed a love for music. As autumn passed, the winter of 1994 arrived. [Ou Yang] showed the songs he composed to his fellow students and senior sisters, applying to participate in the New Year's Eve performance.
0:32:42|0:32:53|When Ou Yang was in distress, the door of Li Jian's office opened and Gao Xiaosong walked out. Ou Yang stopped him.
0:33:12|0:33:19|[Ou Yang] handed over his lyrics to Gao Xiaosong and then left. In the dormitory, [Meng Yifei] and the other two were thinking of some mischievous ideas.
0:33:40|0:34:1|They took out four pills in preparation for the New Year's Eve operation. The New Year's dance began, the hall was decorated with lights and decorations, [Ou Yang] and [Fang Yao] danced with the crowd. [Meng Yifei] confessed his love to [Lei Lei]. Hao Zhiwei and [Wang Xiaochuan] danced wildly in the crowd, [Fang Yao] excitedly said to [Ou Yang].
0:34:9|0:34:26|[Ou Yang] smiled and, while everyone was having a great time, secretly put a pill into the beer. He then walked up to Gao Xiaosong with the beer bottle and [Wang Xiaochuan], who pretended to cry on the side.
0:34:46|0:34:53|Meng Yifei awkwardly smiles after snatching the bottle from Gao Xiaosong's mouth.
0:34:57|0:34:59|Ou Yang has contacted Gao Xiaosong again.
0:35:46|0:36:11|[Ou Yang] looked at the girls below the stage, while [Fang Yao] also had a smile on her face as she listened quietly. Everyone listened to the song counting down to the arrival of the new year.
0:36:24|0:36:46|[Fang Yao] turned around excitedly and hugged [Ou Yang]. [Ou Yang] stood still, feeling a bit at a loss, a bit joyful, and a bit shy. Holding a guitar, [Ou Yang] sat with [Fang Yao] on the steps of the street decorated with colorful lights. [Fang Yao] seemed a bit tipsy.
0:36:55|0:37:16|Ou Yang said nothing, just stared at the girl sitting next to her. She slowly started playing the guitar with the "Fang Yao" BP mark on it. Fang Yao leaned against her shoulder in a daze.
0:37:21|0:37:41|Snowflakes fell from the sky, shining crystal clear in the light. [Ou Yang] glanced at [Fang Yao] leaning on his shoulder, feeling both excited and nervous. He dared not move, afraid of waking her up.
0:37:46|0:37:54|Unable to contain himself, he couldn't resist turning his head and, with a nervous heart, slowly kissed [Fang Yao]'s lips.
0:38:2|0:38:19|In the distance, the sound of fireworks woke up [Fang Yao]. [Ou Yang] sat up nervously, [Fang Yao] rubbed her eyes sleepily, and the brilliant fireworks bloomed in the sky, dazzling the night.
0:38:19|0:38:27|[Fang Yao] raised her hand to catch the falling snowflakes, wearing an exquisite bracelet on her wrist, while [Ou Yang] gazed at her intently.
0:39:45|0:39:53|The scene returns to the basketball court in the past! [Meng Yifei] proudly raises his head!
0:40:1|0:40:17|Mo Yifei began to recall, she kissed [Lei Lei] forcefully, and was slapped in the face. Then she held [Lei Lei]'s face and kissed her fiercely, receiving another slap on the face. In the girls' dormitory.
0:41:0|0:41:4|[Ou Yang] plans to form a band with the other three roommates and participate in the campus song competition.
0:41:34|0:41:51|[Ou Yang] hurriedly put away the paper, but accidentally spilled the water glass on the table. After finishing the internship in the evening, they gathered in the practice room for overtime practice. The 16th on the calendar was marked, which was [Fang Yao]'s birthday. [Ou Yang] carved a small wooden sculpture with [Fang Yao]'s likeness.
0:41:51|0:42:0|Hao Zhiwei always carries two wooden sticks to practice the drum set. Wang Xiaochuan's fingers dance, immersed in the notes, spending the day in a daze.
0:42:2|0:42:25|[Meng Yifei] stood on the street watching the old man playing the three-stringed instrument. In their final days on campus, they freely indulged in their youth, giving their all towards their musical dreams. Finally, they stepped onto the stage of the preliminary round of the 5th Beijing Campus Song Competition.
0:42:37|0:43:1|[Ou Yang] sat at the table playing the guitar and writing a song. The carefully prepared birthday gift for [Fang Yao] was a music box with a wooden figurine of [Fang Yao]. On [Fang Yao]'s birthday, he prepared a surprise in the drama club for her. When [Fang Yao] pushed open the door of the drama club, the room immediately lit up.
0:43:1|0:43:6|Ou Yang starts singing the birthday song, while other classmates appear one after another holding cakes and throwing confetti.
0:43:19|0:43:30|Ou Yang walked up to [Fang Yao] and handed her the music box. [Fang Yao] was moved and hugged Ou Yang tightly, who also held her tightly.
0:43:36|0:43:53|The two of them started to be inseparable, on the small paths on campus, under the big tree on the lawn, everywhere was filled with their sweet affection. Meng Yifei nervously sat on a stone bench holding a bag of snacks, waiting for [Lei Lei]. When he saw [Lei Lei] approaching, he quickly stood up.
0:43:59|0:44:5|She handed the snacks to [Lei Lei], who was about to leave, but she quickly stopped her.
0:44:16|0:44:37|He took out a can of soda from the bag, pulled the tab, and wiped it on himself. [Lei Lei] hesitated for a moment, threw the tab away, and then left angrily.
0:44:39|0:44:51|In the summer of 1995, Fang Yao was practicing English lines in the rehearsal hall when Ou Yang walked over with an envelope and patted her on the shoulder, speaking in English as well.
0:44:58|0:45:2|[Fang Yao] excitedly took the envelope and opened it to read.
0:45:57|0:46:2|Ou Yang stood still in place, his brows furrowed, at a loss and then tried to appear calm.
0:46:24|0:46:31|Ou Yang looked gloomy, the scene returned to the folk bar. Ou Yang lit a cigarette and looked at the mirror in front of him.
0:46:58|0:47:0|Young Ou Yang chased after the car of [Fang Yao] and shouted loudly.
0:47:8|0:47:30|He chased through one intersection after another, the taxi getting further and further away. [Fang Yao] sat in the car, not daring to look back, tears streaming down her face. Ou Yang stood at the intersection, panting, helplessly watching his lover drive away. Back at the bar, middle-aged Ou Yang staggered to a corner with guitars hanging on the wall.
0:48:2|0:48:18|On the paper was written the first line of a song with you in it. Because I dreamt of you leaving, I woke up from my sleep, and he remembered the poem that [Fang Yao] once recited, admiring the time of your youthful joy.
0:48:25|0:48:31|She still saw the beautiful girl in a white dress on the stage in front of her.
0:50:53|0:51:25|You tell me, [Ou Yang] speaks the truth, why didn't you participate? There's no need for so many explanations, I was locked up. Why does [Ou Yang] get impatient when he puts on sunglasses and takes them off? I admit I lied, there aren't so many little emotions in my story. It's still that snowy New Year's Eve, Fang Yao reaches out to catch the falling snowflakes.
0:51:25|0:51:39|[Ou Yang] gazed at her affectionately with his guitar in his arms.
0:52:9|0:52:22|[Fang Yao] was lost in memories. When he was putting a bracelet on [Fang Yao] in the apartment, three knife-wielding robbers approached them. When [Fang Yao] returned with the police, he was injured in the apartment.
0:52:27|0:52:38|The bracelet in the hands of the apartment manager was stained with blood. [Ou Yang] remained silent at [Fang Yao]'s birthday party.
0:53:1|0:53:14|[Ou Yang] was about to confess his feelings when a hand landed on [Fang Yao]'s shoulder. [Ou Yang] stood there, eyes red with astonishment.
0:53:34|0:53:45|[Ou Yang] was feeling complicated, and the music box hidden behind him was never taken out. He returned to the dormitory at night.
0:53:52|0:53:55|[Ou Yang] lay silently on the bed, while [Meng Yifei] ran back panting.
0:54:5|0:54:12|[Ou Yang] leaped out of bed, ready to rush out the door, but was stopped by [Meng Yifei]. He picked up the music box made for [Fang Yao] on the table and looked at it intently. The next day, [Ou Yang] went to find [Fang Yao] and saw [Wang Xiaochuan] also looking for her from a distance.
0:54:36|0:54:58|[Fang Yao] and [Wang Xiaochuan] left, with [Ou Yang] quietly following them. Seeing [Wang Xiaochuan] temporarily leaving, [Ou Yang] caught up. Before finishing calling [Fang Yao]'s name, [Ou Yang] returned. [Ou Yang] quickly hid behind the car parked on the side.
0:55:15|0:55:30|[Ou Yang] climbed out from under the car with a music box in his hand. He stood up, took a few steps forward, and approached to see that Gong Yu and [Fang Yao] had entered a hotel called Wudaokou.
0:55:34|0:56:2|[Ou Yang], feeling disheartened, slowly regained his composure. He turned around and looked at the music box in his hand, placing it on the nearby car. Inside the small restaurant, [Ou Yang] sat alone at a table, drinking heavily. Nearby, the lead singer of the Wei Ming Lake band and his girlfriend were arguing.
0:56:32|0:56:57|[Ou Yang] stood up and threw a punch. [Ou Yang] was kicked down and received a beating. [Meng Yifei] and his companions rushed over to help, and the two groups started fighting. Tables in the restaurant were overturned, and onlookers dared not intervene.
0:57:9|0:57:15|[Ou Yang] vented his anger, kicking the lead singer on the table leg, and the bottle on the table smashed on the lead singer's head.
0:57:31|0:57:49|The notice of dismissal for [Ou Yang] is posted on the bulletin board. In the evening, [Ou Yang] walks in the pouring rain with a guitar on his back, feeling despondent. The rain soaks him through, as he recalls [Ou Yu]'s appearance at the birthday party, with [Fang Yao] following [Ou Yu] into the hotel. He stops in his tracks, letting the pouring rain beat down on him.
0:57:51|0:58:12|He took off the guitar on his back, which meant a lot to him, with a look of sorrow. Tears and rain mixed together. He angrily raised the guitar and used all his strength to smash it on the roadside lamp post again and again. The smashed guitar was abandoned by the roadside.
0:58:12|0:58:17|The rain stopped, and the soaked Ou Yang leaned against the wall.
0:59:43|0:59:46|Meng Yifei's face was also covered with tears.
0:59:56|1:0:4|The scene goes back to the day when Ou Yang went to find Fang Yao. Wang Xiaochuan came to find Fang Yao.
1:0:34|1:0:50|They arrived at the entrance of Wudao Kou Hotel. After Gong Yu left, Ou Yang chased after. Fang Yao turned around to look when she heard the noise.
1:1:19|1:1:24|[Fang Yao] and [Wang Xiaochuan] walk into the lobby of the hotel. [Fang Yao] calls out to [Wang Xiaochuan] who is continuing to walk inside.
1:2:15|1:2:17|[Fang Yao] rejected [Wang Xiaochuan]'s attempt to put his hand on her shoulder.
1:2:26|1:2:49|[Fang Yao] turned and left. As [Fang Yao] walked out of the hotel, she saw the music box that [Ou Yang] had placed on the car, with a small note attached. Inside the bar, [Ou Yang] was surprised by Yuan Jing's story.
1:2:52|1:3:2|He stared in shock at the round mirror, tears glistening in the corners of his eyes.
1:3:23|1:3:41|Ou Yang picked up the bottle of wine, sipped it with a smile, and pointed at [Fang Yao], not knowing what to say. Yuan Jing looked at the man in front of her affectionately, tears already streaming down her face.
1:5:31|1:5:35|Yuan Jing's tears had already made up their mind.
1:5:49|1:5:53|In the past, [Fang Yao] sat on the bed in the dormitory, absent-minded, while [Lei Lei] looked a bit worried.
1:6:26|1:6:32|Fang Yao's gaze gradually shifted to the music box given by Ou Yang on the table. She walked to the table and gently stroked the figurine on top of the vibrating music box.
1:6:53|1:7:5|He pulled open the small drawer of the music box and took out the note inside. The note read:
1:7:9|1:7:11|[Fang Yao] ran to the bottom of the boys' dormitory.
1:7:25|1:7:31|[Fang Yao] was a bit anxious as she ran to the public telephone booth.
1:8:0|1:8:19|[Fang Yao] choked up and couldn't speak. She didn't know where to start or what to say. Tears welled up in her eyes as she tried to speak but stopped herself repeatedly.
1:8:23|1:8:32|[Fang Yao] cried, hung up the phone, and ran away. [Fang Yao] later went abroad.
1:9:35|1:9:38|[Ou Yang] took a sip from the bottle and stood up.
1:10:3|1:10:12|If [Ou Yang] had known that Fang Yao didn't have an affair with Gong Yu, would he not have started a fight?
1:10:21|1:10:39|Yuan Jing smiled at [Ou Yang] and he stood up. In the security room that year, the security guard took out four pieces of paper and pens.
1:11:18|1:11:30|[Lei Lei] ran back to the dormitory. The final of the singing competition is about to begin. In the security room.
1:12:21|1:12:29|[Meng Yifei] picked up a broom to play the bass, Hao Zhiwei sat at the table with a pen, while [Wang Xiaochuan]'s fingers danced on the table.
1:12:34|1:12:47|They were happily immersed in their own world of music, [Ou Yang] smiled with emotion, his gaze fixed on the paper on the table with the lyrics of a song written by you. He picked up the paper, his eyes filled with determination.
1:13:5|1:13:21|[Ou Yang] climbed up to the security room window, stuck his head out and prepared to climb out. [Ou Yang] struggled to overcome his fear, while the other three inside pulled tight the makeshift rope made of jackets tied around [Ou Yang]'s waist.
1:13:25|1:13:39|[Ou Yang] tried to stand up straight and reach the rooftop with both hands. [Meng Yifei] held onto [Ou Yang]'s feet and pushed upwards, while [Ou Yang] grabbed the edge of the rooftop.
1:13:43|1:14:6|[Fang Yao] grabbed [Ou Yang]'s hand and pulled him up with all her strength, while [Lei Lei] below was pulling hard on [Ou Yang] as well. With the combined effort of several people, a tremendous amount of energy was unleashed. [Ou Yang] exerted all his strength and finally climbed up to the rooftop.
1:14:9|1:14:21|Hao Zhiwei slowly loosened the rope, and Ou Yang lay down exhausted on the rooftop.
1:14:28|1:14:32|[Fang Yao] was amused by his anxious look and took out a guitar from behind.
1:14:37|1:14:56|[Ou Yang] took the guitar with the Daman patch and smiled at [Fang Yao]. He grabbed [Fang Yao] and ran out, with the other three following closely behind, while the security guards chased after them.
1:15:23|1:15:29|They ran all the way to the finals venue and ran into the Wei Minghu band. The security guard caught up with them.
1:15:42|1:16:1|The Wei Minghu band helped them stop the security guards. They quickly got on stage to prepare, [Ou Yang] looked at [Fang Yao], wanting to say something but couldn't.
1:16:6|1:16:16|[Ou Yang] ran onto the stage with a guitar on his back, recalling the dream he once shared with [Fang Yao].
1:16:50|1:16:56|On stage, [Ou Yang] mustered up the courage.
1:17:19|1:17:31|At a folk music bar with your presence, [Ou Yang] picked up the old guitar. Originally standing in the audience, the young [Ou Yang] started singing this touching song on the stage.
1:17:44|1:18:1|On screen, the eras of Ou Yang and young Ou Yang intertwine, and both the present Fang Yao and the past are deeply moved by the song.
1:18:26|1:18:34|Lei Lei put the crown on Little Paper and waved to Meng Yifei, while the judges were also immersed in this heartwarming song.
1:18:57|1:19:14|On that rainy night when Ou Yang left, Fang Yao picked up the abandoned guitar under an umbrella and carefully repaired it. The sweet fantasies Ou Yang had about Fang Yao played out once again.
1:19:14|1:19:20|In this story, [Ou Yang] loves [Fang Yao], and [Fang Yao]'s heart has long been given to [Ou Yang].
1:19:25|1:19:33|On the stage, [Ou Yang] shines brightly. In Fang Yao's eyes, in the round mirror's eyes, there are memories of [Ou Yang] from different periods.
1:20:12|1:20:26|Time rewinds, all stories start over, everything goes back to the beginning, back to that heartbreaking rainy night, back to the initial encounter, back to the heart-pounding collision in front of the auditorium.
1:20:35|1:20:47|The ending has already been changed. At this moment, [Ou Yang] at the bar only has earthly matters in his eyes. On the stage of the singing competition finals, [Ou Yang] only has [Fang Yao] in his eyes.
1:20:51|1:20:57|All love and friendship become even more touching at this moment.
1:20:59|1:21:8|In his student days, [Ou Yang] was slightly rebellious under the moonlight, but in his middle age, [Ou Yang] confidently headed towards the distance.
1:21:35|1:22:2|The ventilation fan in the bar is spinning, and sunlight shines through the blades onto the table. [Ou Yang] wakes up groggily. He leaves the sofa, stands up, and looks back at the old guitar hanging on the wall.
1:22:5|1:22:34|Picking up the bottle of alcohol on the table, [Meng Yifei] unscrews the cap. Just before taking a sip, he puts the bottle back down. He walks towards the door, through which the bright sunlight is shining.
