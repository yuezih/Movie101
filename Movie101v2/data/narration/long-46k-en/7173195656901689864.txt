0:0:8|0:0:38|With the sound of music, the scene gradually shows footsteps moving slowly, and then the camera turns. A Western-style wedding scene appears before us, with the bride slowly walking towards the stage under the gaze of the crowd. The flower girls behind her keep throwing petals into the air, while the bride's face is filled with a happy smile.
0:0:38|0:0:52|Before long, she came to the stage, where the groom took a few steps forward to lead the bride up. Then, the bride turned and stood side by side with the groom, and the guests below burst into applause. At this moment, the emcee on stage spoke.
0:2:12|0:2:27|The screen gradually shows several butterflies, and soon the butterflies fly away slowly, revealing the title of the film "Love Across Nine Lifetimes". Then the scene shifts, a city gradually emerges, with tall buildings neatly arranged in the city, and the scene slowly stops in front of a building.
0:3:46|0:3:56|The scene shifts to a tall office building. Inside the building, a girl is seen walking in, she is busy greeting passersby while organizing her backpack.
0:4:44|0:4:48|Her specialty is pleasing the higher-ups and suppressing subordinates.
0:5:13|0:5:23|Speak. Walking down the company corridor, [Cao Aiai] suddenly stopped in her tracks and looked across, only to see [Yan Lang] slowly approaching. [Cao Aiai] then hugged the files to her chest, lowered her head, and walked forward slowly.
0:5:24|0:5:41|At the moment when the two brushed past each other, [Cao Aiai] suddenly turned around and fell down. [Yan Lang] beside her caught her in time, only to see her with closed eyes and pouting lips. At this moment, in [Cao Aiai]'s mind, a scene of [Yan Lang] with closed eyes slowly approaching her appeared. Suddenly, she opened her eyes wide and quickly stood up.
0:5:41|0:5:44|Yan Lang then turned around and picked up the file on the ground to hand it to her.
0:6:6|0:6:22|After speaking, Yan Lang turned and left. [Cao Aiai] watched Yan Lang's back with annoyance, tapping her forehead before turning away. The scene then shifted to a coffee shop, followed by the appearance of a man's photo. [Cao Aiai] was seen carefully examining the photo, occasionally glancing across the street.
0:10:8|0:10:21|[Cao Aiai] immediately spoke in English. The other person sighed, turned around, and took out something to hand to him. He took the item, only to see the three words "Speak English" written on the ID card in his hand.
0:12:6|0:12:19|[Cao Aiai] finished speaking and quickly ran out of the coffee shop. Meanwhile, [Zhan Shaoang] slowly appeared on the elevator, pulling a suitcase as he descended. He then walked away briskly and soon arrived on the street.
0:12:35|0:12:48|[Zhan Shaoang] immediately reached for his pocket. [Zhan Shaoang] quickly turned around and chased after the monk. Before long, he caught up and slowly came to a stop by the roadside, looking around but not seeing the monk. He then angrily slammed the suitcase to the ground.
0:14:31|0:14:46|The scene then shifts to a meeting room, as the camera zooms in, we see the faces of [Cao Aiai] and [Hu Jingjing], both with a blue expression, looking at the man in front of them.
0:14:46|0:14:55|[Hu Jingjing] quickly gestured with her hands, and the man in front of her stood up, while another man immediately sat down. The scene then continued to cycle like this repeatedly.
0:15:4|0:15:8|The scene then shifts, showing the two of them walking slowly down the street.
0:16:7|0:16:11|On the other side, [Zhan Shaoang] was walking on the road, raising his hand to check the time on his watch.
0:16:23|0:16:38|On the other side, at this moment, [Zhan Shaoang] was still walking on the street. He looked around as he walked, then suddenly stopped and looked ahead. The scene then showed a lighted shop, [Zhan Shaoang] looked down at himself, then raised his arm, and his watch caught his eye.
0:16:38|0:16:43|He looked down at his watch, then glanced up ahead from time to time before walking forward.
0:16:59|0:17:15|Accompanied by the screams of the two, a car quickly drove by, leaving only a suitcase by the roadside. The scene then shifted to a heart monitor slowly appearing. Subsequently, [Zhan Shaoang] was lying in bed wearing hospital clothes, with [Cao Aiai] and [Hu Jingjing] standing by the bed.
0:17:52|0:18:2|[Zhan Shaoang] was lying on the hospital bed at this moment, pressing his temples with his hand, then closing his eyes with a furrowed brow. Seeing this, [Wu Jinkin] pulled [Cao Aiai] aside and spoke.
0:19:6|0:19:14|[Zhan Shaoang] on the bed still frowned tightly at the temples under the sun.
0:19:18|0:19:21|[Hu Jingjing] then looked towards the sickbed and turned back to speak.
0:19:24|0:19:34|The scene then cuts to [Cao Aiai], who is seen walking into the corridor and stopping in front of a door, with [Zhan Shaoang] also stopping behind her to look at her.
0:19:34|0:19:48|[Cao Aiai] finished speaking, turned back to glance at [Zhan Shaoang], then jumped up, reaching out to touch the door frame. She then bent down, soon opening the door. After looking at [Zhan Shaoang], she walked into the room, turned on the light, and then began to speak.
0:19:48|0:19:53|After the two entered the room, [Cao Aiai] casually closed the door, changing shoes while speaking again.
0:19:54|0:20:7|[Zhan Shaoang] listened and slowly walked into the living room. He saw [Cao Aiai] bend over to pick up the clothes on the sofa just as he sat down. Glancing at the sofa, [Zhan Shaoang] then stood up slightly, and only then did [Cao Aiai] take the clothes away.
0:20:7|0:20:18|The two were in an awkward situation, with a piece of underwear on the table. [Cao Aiai] picked up the underwear on the table and hurriedly ran away. Shortly after, he came out again.
0:20:52|0:20:54|[Zhan Shaoang] slowly spoke after listening.
0:21:12|0:21:19|[Cao Aiai] immediately lowered her head, took out a piece of paper from her bag, then stood up and looked at the paper in her hand, speaking.
0:21:30|0:21:38|[Cao Aiai] rolled her eyes and then placed her hands on her hips, saying.
0:22:6|0:22:8|[Zhan Shaoang] nodded at this moment.
0:22:51|0:23:6|[Cao Aiai] finished speaking, looked at the back of [Zhan Shaoang], then turned slowly. She walked quickly to the sofa and sat down, the atmosphere tense. The scene then shifted to a plane flying in the air. As the camera zoomed in, the face of [Zhan Shaoang]'s father appeared in front of the plane window.
0:23:43|0:23:54|Then the scene shifts, [Cao Aiai] is sitting at the table looking at the computer. At this moment, [Zhan Shaoang] walks out wrapped in a bathrobe, with his bare upper body, drying his hair as he walks.
0:24:39|0:24:47|[Cao Aiai] walked to the table, threw the bathrobe on it, and sat down angrily to look at the computer. Soon after, [Zhan Shaoang] wrapped himself in a blanket.
0:25:34|0:25:52|The scene then shifts, with the moon in the sky big and round. Inside the house, [Cao Aiai] is tossing and turning on the sofa. After a while, she suddenly sits up, then slowly gets up from the sofa. She walks drowsily past the potted plants in the living room, then turns and heads towards the bathroom door.
0:25:52|0:26:11|Then he pushed open the door and walked in, casually closing the door behind him.

He walked slowly to the bedside, then lay down, next to him [Zhan Shaoang] was sound asleep.
0:26:11|0:26:21|The scene fades in, and when it lights up again, we see [Cao Aiai] lying on [Zhan Shaoang]'s chest. She breathes lightly, then slowly opens her eyes and looks up at [Zhan Shaoang] beside her.
0:30:26|0:30:49|Lazy Pig, I'm in a good mood today. I made breakfast in the kitchen, you have to finish it all. [Zhan Shaoang] is sitting on the sofa at this moment, contentedly eating his breakfast. The scene shifts to the Jersey Era company, where [Cao Aiai] is working at her desk. Suddenly, [Pei Lengcui] strides over with a fierce expression.
0:31:20|0:31:35|[Cao Aiai] looked at the documents on the table, then angrily looked up ahead. Jier turned around and left. The scene then switched to [Cao Aiai] who suddenly opened the door and walked into the room. She then closed the door, changed into slippers on the side, and walked angrily towards the living room.
0:31:35|0:31:41|After walking a few steps, she casually threw her bag on the sofa and sat down.
0:33:49|0:33:58|After speaking, [Zhan Shaoang] picked up the cloth on the ground and bent down to wipe the floor. The scene then shifted to the pool, where [Hu Jingjing] and [Cao Aiai] were slowly swimming towards the edge of the pool.

0:46:2|0:46:9|This property is a new development created under the tightening of the national real estate market regulation and increased competition in the industry.
0:46:56|0:47:2|[Cao Aiai] watched as the two of them walked away, then she squatted down to pick up the cup on the ground, looking at it with frustration.
0:47:3|0:47:19|Shortly after, with a look of grievance, she left the meeting room. In the blink of an eye, it was night time. [Cao Aiai] was seen sitting at the table in her home, focused on the computer screen. As the clock struck midnight, the scene faded away, revealing a pair of hands typing on the keyboard.
0:47:33|0:47:45|Walking to [Cao Aiai]'s workstation, he glanced around, then sat down on [Cao Aiai]'s chair when he saw no one around. He plugged the USB drive into the computer and then smirked mischievously.
0:47:49|0:47:57|[Cao Aiai] sat down immediately, but didn't sit steadily and almost fell off. Then she shifted her body a bit, sat properly, and also casually adjusted her bangs.
0:48:39|0:48:50|[Cao Aiai] then slowly got up and left. She returned to her desk, threw the documents on the table, and rested her head on her hand in frustration before casually flipping through the papers in front of her.

0:53:23|0:53:38|The scene gradually fades, then cuts to the home of [Cao Aiai]. After [Zhan Shaoang] finishes speaking, he turns his head to the side in silence. At this moment, [Cao Aiai] speaks again.
0:54:55|0:55:0|[Cao Aiai] looked at the silent [Zhan Shaoang], then turned her head and slowly spoke.
0:55:6|0:55:23|The scene is clear, only [Zhan Shaoang] is seen wearing a suit and glasses, appearing in the frame. Behind him not far away are two spotlights set up, and there is also a reflector board next to him. [Zhan Shaoang] is looking ahead, and soon he changes into a skirt, puts on a wig, and stands helplessly looking up.
0:55:23|0:55:38|Later, he changed into a floral dress, holding a cigarette, standing with hands on his hips. His head was adorned with permed curls, a mole at the corner of his mouth, giving him a sinister look. He kept changing his movements, while [Hu Jingjing] on the side kept giving him instructions.
0:55:38|0:55:44|[Cao Aiai] was laughing uncontrollably on the side at this moment, and then the scene cut to a meeting room when it lit up again.
0:57:5|0:57:27|The scene then shifts to [Su Man] walking through the airport lobby with a suitcase. She looks around and soon exits through the door. Zhang Jie then takes something and hands it to two children, and one of the children speaks.

On the other side, [Yan Lang] is washing her hands in the bathroom. At this moment, someone comes in and walks up to her, and this person is [Zhan Shaoang].

At that moment, [Cao Aiai], who is working, turns her head with a puzzled expression to look at the three of them.
1:13:55|1:14:2|And the relevant documents were found in the recycle bin of your computer.
1:14:48|1:15:7|At the same time, [Zhan Shaoang] paced back and forth at home with a heavy heart. After a while, he stopped, turned around, picked up the phone on the table, and then put it to his ear. With a furrowed brow, his eyes wandered aimlessly. Soon, he took the phone away from his ear again and looked down at it.
1:15:28|1:15:35|[Zhan Shaoang] hung up the phone immediately, and then the scene shifted to a tall building, followed by the appearance of [Zhan Shaoang]'s father in the frame.

The scene shifted, showing her hurriedly entering the Postal Bank, then quickly coming out of the Bank of China, and rushing into the Agricultural Bank. Her hurried figure shuttled back and forth between the banks, constantly inserting her bank card into the ATM.

The scene then shifted to a pool, where a person in front of the pool slowly picked up a toothbrush and put it in their mouth. This person was none other than [Zhan Shaoang], who suddenly stopped his actions while looking at the words in the mirror.

1:29:36|1:30:3|At this moment, [Cao Aiai] in the seat had tears in her eyes, staring blankly at the screen in front of her. The image on the screen gradually enlarged, showing [Zhan Shaoang] arriving at the entrance of the hospital outpatient building. He slowly looked up at the building, then walked into the hospital and entered the outpatient hall. He gradually slowed down his pace, looking around the surroundings.
1:30:3|1:30:17|The screen fades to a still image. Then, [Zhan Shaoang] is seen in the hospital corridor again, holding something in his hand, asking a nurse nearby. The nurse shakes her head after looking and then pushes a cart away, leaving only [Zhan Shaoang] standing alone in place.

1:31:0|1:31:15|He took a few steps forward, picked up the potato chips on the table, and was seen staring at the chips with a furrowed brow. Then, as if suddenly realizing something, he continued to walk into the room, constantly observing his surroundings.

[Cao Aiai] is sitting in her seat, turning to the side, covering her mouth with her hand, unable to speak.
