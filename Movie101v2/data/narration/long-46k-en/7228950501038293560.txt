0:0:38|0:0:54|A photographer with a DSLR camera looks into the distance, picking up the camera to capture the hard work of the stone miners. The men mining the stones swing their hammers, driving the nails one by one into the rocks.
0:0:56|0:1:12|On the other side, two women splashed water at each other and played around, standing on the stones in the stream washing clothes together. The photographer aimed the camera at the stone masons, quickly pressed the shutter button, and then turned and walked into the woods.
0:1:12|0:1:21|The sounds of laughter and chatter from women washing clothes could be heard from a distance, prompting the photographer to quickly approach in an attempt to capture the scene.
0:1:25|0:1:37|On the other side, the men stepping on stones were swinging hammers hard under the scorching sun, using pry bars to break open large stone slabs. The photographer by the river looked at the woman with a bright smile and couldn't help but take a few more photos.
0:1:58|0:2:17|A large rock on the mountain slid down the slope and hit the ground heavily. The photographer and the women heard the noise and immediately looked towards the slope. The woman who was washing clothes quickly stood up, left the clothes behind, pushed aside the person next to her, and ran towards the slope. The women behind her also followed immediately.
0:2:17|0:2:26|[Wu Zheng] saw the woman looking nervous, so he quickly raised his camera and captured this moment. Upon hearing the shout, the other women also ran towards the mountain.
0:2:27|0:2:45|The woman in front ran into the mountains in one breath, rushing to the scene of the accident. Unexpectedly, this moment was also captured by [Wu Zheng], frozen in the photo, and the camera slowly zoomed out.
0:2:49|0:2:51|Everyone came to visit [Wu Zheng]'s home.
0:3:44|0:3:47|[Wu Zheng] picked up the woman's photo and said with his head down.
0:3:55|0:3:58|The camera cuts to the English woman in the photo.
0:4:2|0:4:7|Because of her husband's injury, she found [Feng Laoqing] at the factory. [Feng Laoqing] leisurely took a sip of tea.
0:4:40|0:4:42|Feng Laoqing is getting anxious now.
0:5:9|0:5:17|Shui Xiu was at a loss for words for a moment. At this moment, a woman walked in with a teacup in her hand. She set down the teacup and turned to Feng Laoqing.
0:5:47|0:5:49|Shui Xiu walked forward upon hearing this.
0:5:53|0:5:55|After speaking, [Shui Xiu] left quietly.
0:6:1|0:6:18|In the courtyard, a man with long legs sat on a bench, struggling to peel corn, with a pair of crutches beside him. [Shui Xiu] walked into the courtyard carrying a basket of vegetables, smiled at the man, then placed the basket on the table and turned to look at him.
0:6:41|0:6:54|[Shui Xiu] listened to the man's words, picked up a basket of corn, and squatted in front of the man. The man, hearing [Shui Xiu]'s words, angrily started working, venting his doubts.
0:7:3|0:7:9|The camera cuts to an old man sitting at a table in the courtyard, as a girl walks over carrying dishes.
0:8:0|0:8:15|The girl heard the voice of [Shui Xiu] and got up to greet her. [Shui Xiu] walked to the table and sat down, taking out a piece of paper from her pocket and handing it to [Feng Laoqing]. The girl looked at the paper on the table, then glanced at [Shui Xiu] with confusion.
0:9:22|0:9:28|[Feng Laoqing] suddenly pushed the documents on the table. [Shui Xiu] stood up angrily, took the documents and left.
0:9:37|0:9:46|In the blink of an eye, it was already evening, and the village was filled with a sense of harmony. The dilapidated adobe house in the courtyard served as the family's small kitchen, where [Shui Xiu] was preparing Chinese medicine for [Feng Laoqing].
0:9:47|0:10:6|She blew on the steaming Chinese medicine while carefully pouring it out. Then, [Shui Xiu] carried the medicine and walked into the room. The furniture in the room looked old, with only an old TV and some simple tables, chairs, and sofas. [Feng Laoqing] was sitting on the sofa reading a book.
0:10:12|0:10:15|[Shui Xiu] finished her instructions and then turned to start sorting out the clothes piled on the chair.
0:10:23|0:10:27|He picked up the clothes and started to tidy them up on the table, one by one.
0:11:10|0:11:23|After speaking, [Shui Xiu] walked out of the room. [Feng Laoqing] struggled to stand up with both hands on the cane. [Shui Xiu] quickly turned back to support her.
0:11:58|0:12:5|Feng Yucheng struggled to move his lower body and continued, "I can't give you anything."
0:12:10|0:12:16|[Shui Xiu] stepped forward, bent down, and tenderly hugged [Feng Laoqing].
0:12:36|0:12:48|In the blink of an eye, it was the next morning. [Shui Xiu] was about to wash clothes while [Liu Yuhai]'s wife stopped her, pulling out a bulging handkerchief from her pocket.
0:13:7|0:13:15|After speaking, [Shui Xiu] decisively walked past [Feng Laoqing]. [Feng Laoqing] hurriedly called out to stop [Shui Xiu].
0:13:20|0:13:26|After finishing speaking, Shui Xiu picked up the basin and left without looking back. The scene then switched to Feng Laoqing making a phone call by the roadside.
0:13:33|0:13:46|But don't forget, when she heard the word "law", [Shui Xiu] hesitated for a moment, but then decided to leave. [Wu Zheng] turned around, and when he saw [Shui Xiu]'s figure, he quickly called out to him.
0:13:50|0:13:57|[Shui Xiu] turned around, and [Wu Zheng] immediately recognized him. [Shui Xiu] looked at [Wu Zheng] and asked in confusion.
0:14:4|0:14:6|Shui Xiu takes Wu Zheng back home.
0:14:23|0:14:25|[Feng Yucheng] warmly greeted [Wu Zheng] to sit down.
0:14:42|0:14:54|[Wu Zheng] took out money from his pocket and handed it to [Feng Yucheng], while [Shui Xiu] watched the two with a smile on her face. Since then, [Wu Zheng] stayed at [Shui Xiu]'s house. One night, [Shui Xiu] knocked on [Wu Zheng]'s door.
0:15:1|0:15:4|[Shui Xiu] looked at [Wu Zheng], wanting to say something but hesitating.
0:15:12|0:15:17|Upon hearing [Wu Zheng]'s words, [Shui Xiu] shyly sat down at the table.
0:16:11|0:16:22|[Shui Xiu] listened thoughtfully to [Wu Zheng]'s words. [Wu Zheng] turned around and searched in his bag for something.
0:16:29|0:16:50|[Wu Zheng] stood still holding an envelope. The scene shifts, a man playing cards in a car sees [Shui Xiu] pushing a bicycle and immediately walks over. The man looks [Shui Xiu] up and down. [Shui Xiu] glances at him.
0:17:25|0:17:43|Erniuzi watched as [Shui Xiu] walked away, feeling anxious. On the other side, [Shui Xiu] rode her bicycle alone across a long stone bridge, the winding mountain road was very tortuous, and the magnificent high mountains made [Shui Xiu] appear very small. The wind blowing by the river lifted [Shui Xiu]'s spirits, and she felt no fatigue at all while riding the bike.
0:17:46|0:18:2|A large truck whizzed past [Shui Xiu] on the road, and she rode her bike all the way to the countryside. She pushed her bike into a yard, looked around in all directions. [Shui Xiu] found Director [Liu].
0:19:0|0:19:11|[Shui Xiu], ignoring Director Liu's attempts to stop her, picked up her bag and walked out calmly. No matter how loudly Ren Ping called out to her, she didn't turn back. Then she rode her bike to the entrance of the county government, where a security guard stepped forward to block her.
0:19:19|0:19:37|Upon hearing the security guard's words, [Shui Xiu] turned her head to look. With a sigh, she reluctantly turned her bicycle in the direction of the petition office. Suddenly, strong winds swept through the sky, accompanied by flashes of lightning and thunder. Inside the house, [Feng Yucheng] leaned on his cane and walked out into the yard, anxiously gazing at the dark and oppressive sky.
0:19:37|0:19:40|Suddenly, a loud thunderclap, followed by a torrential downpour from the sky.
0:19:42|0:20:1|He anxiously leaned on his cane and came to the stone table, afraid that the corn would get wet. He quickly lifted one cane and covered the corn with plastic film. At this moment, Shui Xiu happened to rush back home and saw Feng Yu Cheng accidentally fall. Another loud thunder, the rain poured harder and harder, Shui Xiu quickly helped Feng Yu Cheng lay out the plastic film.
0:20:3|0:20:21|He then pulled him up from the ground, wrapped his waist, and staggered quickly towards the house. On the other side, [Shui Xiu] pushed his bicycle and hurried to take shelter from the rain under a bus stop sign. Holding a cloth bag, he could only watch helplessly as the fierce wind and heavy rain approached him.
0:20:21|0:20:41|Under the cover of night, the entire street was only accompanied by a small bus stop sign. Seeing this, [Shui Xiu] took a deep breath, pushed her bicycle forward and continued to ride in the rain. Finally finding an inn, she quickly ran inside after parking her bicycle. The female innkeeper looked at [Shui Xiu] and asked:
0:20:52|0:20:56|The female boss cracked melon seeds and said impatiently, [Shui Xiu],
0:20:57|0:21:15|[Shui Xiu] picked up her bag and walked out of the guesthouse. She glanced at the sky outside, gritted her teeth, and pushed her bicycle into the heavy rain. As the rain poured down harder, [Shui Xiu] quickly adjusted the handlebars and started running in the rain. Meanwhile, at home, [Feng Yucheng] and [Wu Zheng] prepared food and started drinking.
0:22:7|0:22:29|After Feng Yucheng finished speaking, he burst into tears. [Shui Xiu] arrived at the entrance of the petition office in the pouring rain, pushing a bicycle. He crouched down at the entrance, looking very vulnerable. On the other side, Feng Yucheng thought of his own tragic experience, and couldn't help but hold his head in pain, tears streaming down his face.
0:22:45|0:22:54|[Shui Xiu] squatted at the entrance of the petition office, holding her bag. The cold rain beat against her face. With the night falling, [Shui Xiu] wearily closed her eyes.
0:22:57|0:23:17|In the blink of an eye, it was the early hours of the second day. [Shui Xiu] was sitting at the entrance of the petition office, hugging her bag and falling asleep. The bright sunlight slowly woke [Shui Xiu] up, and she looked around, running her hand through her hair. Soon, the staff of the petition office came over and opened the door from inside the lobby.
0:23:17|0:23:24|[Shui Xiu] quickly got up, rubbed her stiff legs that had been sitting on the ground for a long time. She straightened her clothes again and combed her hair.
0:23:26|0:23:45|Carrying her bag, [Shui Xiu] followed the staff into the gate of the petition office. After coming out of the office, she rode her bike on the way back home. The experience of hitting walls everywhere yesterday made her unable to hold back her tears. The fatigue of running around for a day and a night had already exhausted her.
0:23:45|0:24:5|While riding across the same stone bridge as yesterday, [Shui Xiu] struggled to pedal the bike. However, eventually exhausted, he got off and slowly pushed the bike forward. The beautiful scenery couldn't lift [Shui Xiu]'s tired spirits. His steps gradually slowed down, as if all his strength had been depleted.
0:24:6|0:24:27|[Shui Xiu] stopped the car, panting heavily with no food in her stomach, feeling dizzy. She wiped the sweat off her forehead, adjusted her breathing continuously, and then looked towards the direction of home with determination. [Shui Xiu] got on her bike and continued along the winding and rugged mountain road.
0:24:27|0:24:52|She came to a section of uphill stone road, and the bicycle seemed to have turned into a thousand pounds. She was panting heavily, her gaze no longer firm. Suddenly everything went black in front of her, and [Shui Xiu] collapsed on the road due to exhaustion. When she opened her eyes again, a group of people had gathered around her.
0:24:52|0:25:1|Amid the crowd's shouts, [Shui Xiu] finally saw [Feng Yucheng] and the girl in front of her. Leaning on the pillow, she weakly spoke.
0:25:27|0:25:33|Village chief [Feng Laoqing] learned that [Shui Xiu] had fainted, and he rushed over panting heavily.
0:27:7|0:27:9|[Feng Laoqing] picked up the sausage in his hand.
0:27:13|0:27:27|After speaking, [Feng Laoqing] threw the sausage down and turned to leave. [Shui Xiu] angrily looked at the sausage at the end of the bed, bent down suddenly, picked it up, and took a big bite. Her wolfing down the food directly amused everyone.
0:27:28|0:27:36|Shui Xiu was so angry that she even amused herself. On the other side, Er Niu took the initiative to find Liu Yuhai.
0:28:21|0:28:28|The scene changes, [Wu Zheng] takes out a photo and hands it to [Shui Xiu]. In the photo, it is [Shui Xiu] and the girl washing clothes together.
0:29:9|0:29:12|After speaking, [Wu Zheng] quickly took out a follow-up letter from his pocket.
0:30:7|0:30:23|Because the signal was lost, [Shui Xiu] took the girl and [Wu Zheng] to experience the beauty of nature. The three of them walked side by side towards the depths of the forest, surrounded by rolling mountains and lush trees. The villagers' houses appeared very small in front of the mountains.
0:30:35|0:30:48|After returning to the village, [Wu Zheng] gazed at the distant mountains, seemingly lost in thought. Warrior slowly came back to his senses.
0:31:34|0:31:44|Early the next morning, cries were heard in the village as a group of people carried a stretcher and walked towards the house.
0:31:59|0:32:12|[Shui Xiu] heard the sound and approached to investigate. Upon hearing the man's words, [Shui Xiu] was filled with sadness.
0:32:14|0:32:19|On the other side, [Feng Yucheng]'s wife gathered all the women in the village together.
0:32:50|0:33:6|After speaking, [Feng Yucheng]'s wife led everyone to pick up hoes and headed to the slate factory. The workers at the slate factory heard the noise and immediately stepped forward to stop the women. The person in charge of the slate factory also hurried out.
0:33:9|0:33:13|Suddenly, [Shui Xiu] ran out through the crowd. [Shui Xiu] looked breathlessly at the impulsive crowd.
0:34:33|0:34:35|Shui Xiu finally smiled.
0:34:47|0:34:58|[Shui Xiu] looked helpless as she entered the village chief's office. [Feng Laoqing] took a sip of tea, set down the teacup, and spoke to her and his daughter.
0:37:25|0:37:30|The first phase of their plan was successfully completed, and the girl happily ran out of Liu Yuhai's house.
0:37:35|0:37:39|[Shui Xiu] walked towards the small shop in her home, carrying a plate of food.
0:37:45|0:37:52|Come on, everyone was just about to start eating when Er Niu climbed up the low wall of [Shui Xiu]'s house.
0:38:41|0:38:46|[Feng Yucheng] was hurt by Erniuzi's words, and drank one glass after another.
0:38:54|0:38:58|[Feng Yucheng] continued to drink silently without saying a word.
0:39:9|0:39:21|Come, night falls in the blink of an eye. [Feng Yucheng] recalls what Erniu said, his mind filled with thoughts making it hard to fall asleep. [Shui Xiu] lies beside him, silently watching his profile, eyes full of tenderness.
0:39:30|0:39:35|On the side, [Shui Xiu] seemed to sense [Feng Yucheng]'s sadness and comforted him softly.
0:39:46|0:39:53|[Feng Yucheng] rested his head on his arm in silence, feeling deeply saddened by his own experiences.
0:40:2|0:40:22|His heart was filled with both resignation and unwillingness. [Feng Yucheng] turned his head to look at [Shui Xiu], then squeezed towards [Shui Xiu], and the two hugged tightly together. The night was very quiet, and [Feng Yucheng] suddenly sat up from the bed, sighing helplessly.
0:40:22|0:40:24|Shui Xiu watched Feng Laoqing with concern.
0:40:32|0:40:38|[Feng Yucheng] angrily held the bed with his hands, and [Shui Xiu] quickly calmed him down.
0:40:53|0:41:10|Later, under the comfort of [Shui Xiu], [Feng Laoqing] finally lay down slowly. He carefully tucked him in. After [Feng Laoqing] fell asleep, he gently opened the door, walked out of the room cautiously, and then quietly closed the door.
0:41:10|0:41:28|[Shui Xiu] remembered [Feng Yucheng]'s ordeal, turned around and walked into the courtyard with a sad heart. In the moonlight, his sorrowful expression was filled with bitterness and grievance. He walked slowly forward, recalling past experiences, and as he looked up, he saw a figure standing not far away.
0:41:29|0:41:37|[Wu Zheng] slowly turned his head. [Shui Xiu] walked up to [Wu Zheng] and he looked at her in surprise.
0:41:53|0:42:21|[Shui Xiu] hugged her arms, took two steps forward with her head down, and then said sadly. "You are so kind-hearted, but the night wind blows, bringing a chill." Seeing [Shui Xiu] in thin clothing, [Wu Zheng] quickly took off his coat and handed it to her. [Shui Xiu] took the coat and turned to look at [Wu Zheng].
0:42:52|0:42:56|[Shui Xiu] nodded and smiled after listening to [Wu Zheng]'s words.
0:43:13|0:43:18|After speaking, [Wu Zheng] turned around and went back into the house, leaving only [Shui Xiu] standing alone in the courtyard.
0:43:21|0:43:34|The next moment, he turned around and found [Feng Yucheng] standing at the door staring at him intently. Seeing [Shui Xiu] turning around, [Feng Yucheng] angrily slammed the door with his cane and then got up to return to his room.
0:43:34|0:43:47|Watching his departing figure, [Shui Xiu] suddenly remembered that he was still wearing the coat of non-struggle, so he quickly took it off. He looked down at the coat in his hand, then anxiously glanced at the door that had been slammed shut.
0:43:49|0:44:3|The next morning, [Shui Xiu] prepared breakfast early. Seeing [Feng Yucheng] struggling to walk with a cane, [Shui Xiu] quickly went up to him, carefully helped him to sit at the table, and then continued to set the tableware.
0:44:8|0:44:21|[Shui Xiu] saw that [Wu Zheng] didn't respond, so she turned around and looked at his room in confusion. Normally, [Wu Zheng] didn't like to sleep in, he would get up early. [Shui Xiu] turned around and walked towards the door of [Wu Zheng]'s room.
0:44:28|0:44:41|[Shui Xiu] knocked on the door again, but there was no response from [Wu Zheng]'s room. [Shui Xiu] carefully pushed the door open and walked in. She looked around, the room was empty and [Wu Zheng] had tidied it up neatly.
0:44:41|0:44:53|[Shui Xiu] looked around the empty room in confusion, staring at the neatly made bed, recalling scenes of [Wu Zheng] in the room. As she turned around, she noticed a note left by [Wu Zheng] on the desk.
0:44:57|0:45:4|He walked to the desk, picked up the note on the table slowly, and read it carefully.
0:45:18|0:45:31|After reading the note left by [Wu Zheng], [Shui Xiu] appeared pensive. Meanwhile, [Wu Zheng] had already driven back to the city. It is unfortunate for a pure and kind woman like [Shui Xiu] to bear the pressure that she should not have to endure.
0:45:43|0:45:46|The car sped across the bridge, on the other side, [Shui Xiu], [Feng Laoqing], and [Yao Yao] were watching anxiously.
0:46:2|0:46:5|Uncle [Feng Laoqing] handed the gift letter to [Shui Xiu].
0:46:48|0:46:50|Er Niu said most anxiously.
0:47:8|0:47:15|Shui Xiu and Feng Laoqing looked at each other with furrowed brows. Liu Yuhai let out a sigh and came up with a solution. Yao Yao asked in confusion.
0:48:13|0:48:30|Er Niu Zi listened and immediately went out to inform the villagers. Liu Yuhai angrily threw the notification document on the ground and muttered to himself in anger. In the afternoon, Mei Feng came to the house.
0:49:5|0:49:25|[Shui Xiu] and the girl just returned home. She walked up and greeted Meifeng generously. Yucheng saw [Shui Xiu] and immediately turned back into the house in anger. [Shui Xiu] turned to Meifeng and said.
0:49:28|0:49:30|Shui Xiu's furrowed brow gradually relaxes.
0:49:39|0:49:41|Shui Xiu looked helpless after hearing it.
0:49:59|0:50:3|[Shui Xiu] took the project proposal from the girl with a strong turn.
0:50:33|0:50:40|After speaking, Meifeng left with a strong momentum, and the scene shifted to the election meeting in Yinghancun.
0:52:29|0:52:32|Meifeng sat below and gave Liu Yuhai a sideways glance.
0:52:36|0:52:40|The villagers were excited and clapped their hands when they heard they could make money.
0:52:44|0:52:47|When Shui Xiu started speaking, Er Niu deliberately squeezed next to the money sign.
0:54:56|0:54:59|After speaking, the two of them smiled at each other.
0:55:5|0:55:9|Liu Yuhai covered his neck with a towel and nodded at Er Niuzi.
0:55:31|0:55:43|Liu Yuhai nodded in satisfaction after hearing it. Er Niuzi saw this, smiled and squatted down, with one hand on the sofa. Seeing Liu Yuhai staring at him, he stood up cheerfully. Liu Yuhai looked up.
0:55:54|0:55:58|After speaking, he couldn't help but cough, and Er Niu was serving in the alliance.
0:56:28|0:56:39|[Shui Xiu] and Yao Yao arrived at the village chief's office. [Liu Yuhai] impatiently picked up a teacup, took a sip, and then put the proposal into the drawer.
0:56:40|0:56:42|[Shui Xiu] and Yao Yao looked at him in confusion.
0:56:59|0:57:4|As long as it can be promoted, Yao Yao from Shui Xiu also nodded.
0:57:42|0:57:55|[Liu Yuhai] was shocked after hearing [Shui Xiu]'s words, he stood up and turned around. [Shui Xiu] angrily took Yang Yao's hand and decisively turned away. [Liu Yuhai] watched their backs as he hummed a tune with his hands behind his back.
0:58:2|0:58:6|[Shui Xiu] placed something wrapped in a newspaper on the table.
0:58:11|0:58:15|[Yao Yao] stared with wide eyes at [Wu Zheng], then at [Shui Xiu].
0:58:29|0:58:33|[Yao Yao] and [Shui Xiu] exchanged a smile and [Shui Xiu] said.
0:58:39|0:58:50|[Wu Zheng] nodded with a smile. [Shui Xiu] and [Yao Yao] found [Liu Yuhai] with the money. [Liu Yuhai] put down the money and walked over to the two with a smile.
0:58:51|0:58:55|He nodded at [Shui Xiu]. [Yao Yao] responded to this.
1:0:17|1:0:22|Shui Xiu finally smiled on her face. Er Niuzi suddenly spoke.
1:0:39|1:0:42|Erniuzi happily jumped off the chair.
1:0:59|1:1:1|[Yao Yao] walked towards the crowd with a file in her hand.
1:1:20|1:1:22|At this moment, Erniuzi spoke again.
1:1:31|1:1:47|[Shui Xiu]'s witty response made everyone laugh. A few days later, [Shui Xiu] opened a restaurant at home. Er Niu stood on a ladder to help hang the signboard, while Wu Zheng took unauthorized photos. When everyone saw the restaurant open, [Shui Xiu] looked at everyone and said happily.
1:1:54|1:2:8|Firecrackers sounded, Sun Ming and the tourists rushed into the courtyard. The courtyard of [Shui Xiu]'s house was packed with people, creating a lively scene. [Yao Yao] and Er Niu were busy serving dishes to the guests, shuttling back and forth in the courtyard.
1:2:8|1:2:14|[Feng Yucheng] sat on the chair, seeing the lively scene in front of him, feeling both gratified and happy, couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.
1:2:25|1:2:38|After a while, the tourists finished eating and left one after another, with [Shui Xiu] and Yao Yao warmly seeing them off.
1:2:43|1:3:0|After the tourists dispersed, [Shui Xiu] smiled and said. Er Niu helped [Feng Yucheng] bring a chair to the Lotus King. Yao Yao carefully checked the account book, while [Shui Xiu] and the others looked on with anticipation.
1:3:14|1:3:21|Suddenly, the voice of Meifeng came, holding a chicken and leading a group of people.
1:3:38|1:4:5|On the other side, Liu Yuhai's slate factory only has a few workers. Shui Xiu is carefully counting the number of slates. Liu Yuhai looks around the slate factory and walks up to Shui Xiu, saying.
1:4:21|1:4:25|Liu Yuhai was so angry that he didn't know what to say for a moment. Shantao quickly comforted him.
1:4:45|1:4:47|[Liu Yuhai] was stunned for a moment. Then he furrowed his brows and shook his head.
1:5:6|1:5:10|Glancing at the workers in front of them, [Shui Xiu] and [Feng Laoqing] both sighed at the same time.
1:5:29|1:5:42|At this moment, Erniu came to the slate factory, and Shantao glared at him angrily. Erniu walked up and was warmly greeted by [Liu Yuhai].
1:6:27|1:6:29|Liu Yuhai pulled Er Niu Zi over.
1:6:50|1:6:57|[Liu Yuhai] immediately stood up and leaned in, [Liu Yuhai] sighed and thought with his eyes.
1:7:25|1:7:43|He turned around and looked at [Niu Jieshi] pointing to the office. On the other side, [Feng Yucheng] came to [Wu Zheng]'s room, leaning on a cane to wipe the coffee table, then turned around slowly and walked towards the desk, helping him tidy up the table, which was messy with many books of [Wu Zheng].
1:7:45|1:8:2|He picked up the books on the table, neatly arranged them one by one, and carefully wiped the desk with a cloth. Then, [Feng Yucheng] leaned on a cane and struggled to reach the bedside. He, with a cane in one hand, awkwardly straightened the clothes on the bed with the other hand.
1:8:3|1:8:22|He picked up the clothes that [Wu Zheng] had thrown around, neatly placing them on the pillow. As he was about to pick up the last piece of clothing, many photos suddenly fell out. Curiously, he picked up the scattered photos on the bed and, upon closer inspection, he found that the main character in the photos was his wife, [Shui Xiu].
1:8:23|1:8:37|[Feng Yucheng] flipped through the photos one by one, thinking of the rumors in the village, and angrily threw the photos away. The next day, [Feng Yucheng] leaned against a big tree, watching [Shui Xiu], while [Niu Jieshi] warmly greeted the tourists.
1:8:44|1:8:51|Er [Niu Jieshi] saw [Feng Yucheng] leaning against a tree, feeling suspicious in his heart, he walked up with a sly smile, approached [Feng Yucheng] and said.
1:9:24|1:9:36|Help [Feng Yucheng] realize his dream of developing tourism. [Liu Yuhai]'s smile gradually stiffened, and his face turned ugly. Er Niuzi added fuel to the fire and continued speaking.
1:10:1|1:10:13|[Feng Yucheng] couldn't take it anymore, picked up the pipe and was about to hit Er Niu Zi. Even though I didn't say anything, Er Niu Zi ran away without looking back, and in the evening, [Shui Xiu] brought the meal into the house.
1:11:4|1:11:6|[Shui Xiu] stood up angrily.
1:11:16|1:11:22|[Feng Yucheng] raised his hand and slapped [Shui Xiu], who looked at him in shock and then ran out of the house.
1:11:24|1:11:33|[Feng Yucheng] watched as [Shui Xiu] walked away, unable to contain his anger any longer. He angrily swept all the food on the table to the floor and knocked over the chair.
1:11:33|1:11:44|He gasped heavily, his eyes fixed on the photo of Shui Xiu and Feng Laoqing hanging on the wall. He grabbed the glass on the table and fiercely threw it towards the photo, shattering the glass outside the photo on the ground.
1:11:47|1:12:2|[Feng Yucheng] roared angrily. On the other side, [Shui Xiu] ran along the path, the night was dark, but her footsteps never stopped. [Shui Xiu] ran down the stairs to a stone gate, panting as she leaned against the wall.
1:12:2|1:12:16|Her eyes were vacant, leaning against the wall, lost in thought about the experience just now. She raised her hand, touched her face which was still hot from being slapped by [Feng Yucheng], her mind swirling, tears constantly welling up in her eyes.
1:12:17|1:12:24|In the end, unable to hold back her tears, [Shui Xiu] felt extremely wronged in the face of [Feng Yucheng]'s misunderstanding and the rumors in the village.
1:12:31|1:12:51|He leaned on a cane and clumsily bumped into the door frame. After adjusting several times, he finally managed to walk out of the house with difficulty. He carefully walked down the steps, quickly crossed the yard. Then, shouting, he walked to the front gate. The stone steps at the gate were very steep, so he could only slowly descend the stairs with the help of his cane.
1:12:51|1:13:1|But his heart was filled with anxiety. [Feng Yucheng] walked out of the house, shouting loudly. He arrived at the place where [Shui Xiu] had just run past, but did not see [Shui Xiu]'s figure.
1:13:3|1:13:21|He stopped in his tracks, anxiously looking ahead. No matter how he called out, he couldn't get a response from [Shui Xiu]. Then, [Feng Laoqing] turned around and walked towards a downhill path. The uneven cobblestone road was exceptionally difficult for him.
1:13:24|1:13:28|Without paying attention, Shui Xiu slipped and fell heavily to the ground.
1:13:32|1:13:56|He sat on the ground looking around, then he picked up a crutch from the ground, and picked up another one next to him, putting both under his arms. He struggled to stand up, but failed several times. [Feng Yucheng] used his arms to support his body with the crutches, trembling and struggling to stand up.
1:13:56|1:14:4|He walked towards the steps with a cane, which were very steep. [Feng Laoqing]'s cane slipped, and he rolled directly down the steps.
1:14:5|1:14:20|On the other side, [Shui Xiu] heard [Feng Yucheng]'s shout and quickly turned around to run over. She swiftly ran towards her home direction. With the night falling, she hurriedly shuttled through the alley, taking three steps and sitting two steps, rushing into the courtyard, and searching for [Feng Yucheng]'s figure inside the house.
1:14:22|1:14:40|[Shui Xiu] was shocked as soon as she entered the room, seeing broken tableware scattered all over the floor. The scene was a mess. She looked at the shattered photo hanging on the wall, and was stunned. Sadness filled [Shui Xiu]'s eyes, tears rolling in her eyes.
1:14:40|1:14:47|She thought for a moment, then immediately turned around and rushed into the courtyard to look for [Feng Yucheng]. She looked around the courtyard and shouted loudly.
1:14:50|1:14:56|[Shui Xiu] couldn't find [Feng Yucheng] anywhere in the house. Just then, she met [Wu Zheng] who had just returned home at the door.
1:15:19|1:15:21|They arrived at the stone path that [Feng Yucheng] had just walked on.
1:15:29|1:15:51|At the bottom of the stairs, [Shui Xiu] found a cane. She quickly picked it up and recognized it as [Feng Yucheng]'s cane. Looking ahead, she discovered [Feng Yucheng] lying on the ground. [Wu Zheng] quickly carried [Feng Yucheng] on his back and took him to the hospital.
1:15:51|1:15:54|In the office, [Liu Yuhai] patted Er Niu's shoulder and said.
1:15:58|1:16:6|Er Niu Zi showed a flattering smile, and [Liu Yuhai] turned around, leaning in to say to him.
1:16:13|1:16:23|At the hospital, [Shui Xiu] was sleeping on [Feng Laoqing]'s hospital bed. When [Feng Laoqing] woke up, he gently stroked [Shui Xiu]'s hair. She opened her eyes and immediately covered [Feng Laoqing] with a blanket.
1:16:27|1:16:40|[Feng Yucheng] let out a long sigh and said, "[Shui],", then turned his face away in despair.
1:16:55|1:16:59|[Feng Yucheng] turned to [Shui Xiu] and said.
1:17:39|1:17:43|After speaking, [Feng Yucheng] started crying sadly, and [Shui Xiu] helplessly said.
1:18:2|1:18:6|[Feng Yucheng] turned his head and looked at [Shui Xiu], letting out a long sigh.
1:18:30|1:18:47|He tightly held [Shui Xiu]'s hand and sighed. As he spoke, tears uncontrollably streamed down his face.
1:19:10|1:19:21|[Shui Xiu] finished speaking, then gently wrapped her arms around [Feng Yucheng], resting her head lightly on his shoulder.
1:19:37|1:19:46|[Feng Yucheng] cried sadly after listening to [Shui Xiu]'s words. Inside the village chief's office, [Liu Yuhai] gathered the villagers together.
1:20:4|1:20:7|Yao Yao stood up angrily after listening, saying.
1:20:26|1:20:30|Shui Xiu and Feng Laoqing looked at each other angrily.
1:20:47|1:20:58|[Yao Yao] listened, gave her a sidelong glance, then shifted her gaze elsewhere. Afterwards, [Liu Yuhai] turned around, sat on the chair, and spoke.
1:21:17|1:21:20|Yang Yao looked at him and couldn't help but sneer.
1:21:35|1:21:39|The next day, several buses stopped at the entrance of Yingkan Village.
1:22:2|1:22:11|[Shui Xiu] gathered the villagers together, and everyone welcomed the arrival of Minister Yang with joy. Yingtan Village was completely filled with the lively atmosphere of drums and gongs.
1:23:53|1:24:1|Leaders and tourists were all enjoying the beautiful scenery in Yingtan Village. A few days later, [Shui Xiu] and [Yao Yao] bid farewell to [Wu Zheng].
1:24:23|1:24:29|[Shui Xiu] smiled and responded to [Wu Zheng]'s words.
1:24:33|1:24:51|[Wu Zheng] waved goodbye to [Yao Yao], then she turned and walked to the car to open the door. Instead of getting in right away, she turned her head and looked at [Shui Xiu]. Seeing [Wu Zheng] turn back, [Yao Yao] waved enthusiastically, but [Shui Xiu] stood aside, sadly lowering her head.
1:24:51|1:25:5|[Shui Xiu] looked at [Wu Zheng] and smiled, then turned around and got into the car. With a bang, the car door seemed to hit [Shui Xiu]'s heart. Tears filled his eyes as he stared at [Wu Zheng]'s car, and [Wu Zheng] stepped on the gas pedal and drove away.
1:25:5|1:25:17|Yao Yao was still waving happily in the direction that Wu Zheng left. She turned her head to look at Shui Xiu, only to see Shui Xiu frowning with a sad expression. Meanwhile, Wu Zheng's car drove over the stone bridge.
1:25:44|1:26:2|The unlicensed car turned on the bridge and gradually disappeared into the distance. In the morning, [Shui Xiu] supported [Feng Laoqing] walking on the stone path. He leaned on a crutch while [Shui Xiu] held his other arm. Every step he took was extremely difficult for him. After a few steps, he began to pant heavily.
1:26:12|1:26:17|Shui Xiu and Feng Laoqing frowned upon hearing this, and the leaders gathered in the government office for a meeting.
1:26:20|1:26:30|The illegal use of explosives in the colored stone factory led to casualties and triggered a more serious mass incident.
1:26:33|1:26:38|A comprehensive safety inspection of all the colored stone factories in the county was simultaneously conducted.
1:27:6|1:27:11|On the other side, the dining table at [Shui Xiu]'s house was filled with tempting dishes.
1:27:15|1:27:17|Upon entering the room, Shui Xiu was shocked by the delicious food in front of her.
1:27:44|1:27:52|[Feng Yucheng] didn't want [Shui Xiu] to support him. The two exchanged smiles, and [Shui Xiu] shed tears of excitement.
1:28:0|1:28:7|[Shui Xiu] laughed happily, tears of emotion hanging on her cheeks. Later, [Yao Yao] and Er Niu became tour guides in Yingtan Village.
1:29:7|1:29:21|A familiar voice, familiar words came from behind [Shui Xiu], and the person in front of her revealed a big smile.
