0:2:29|0:2:46|[Li Xing] finished speaking and smirked at her, causing the girl to laugh. There was a hint of tenderness in his eyes. Seeing this, the boy also started eating, but his attention was all on the girl, causing him to accidentally knock off the lid of his lunchbox. Many years later, the grown-up [He Qiaoqiao] is now working with porcelain.
0:2:54|0:3:2|She picked up the porcelain on the table and walked towards [Li Xing], who held the bowl and fed the soup by hand.
0:3:7|0:3:20|[Li Xing] was slurping his soup when [He Qiaoqiao] noticed something. She took out a band-aid, tore open the packaging, applied it to the wound, and then kissed the wound.
0:3:33|0:3:50|[He Qiaoqiao] suddenly kissed [Li Xing]. Accompanied by the cheers of their friends, the two kissed, and [He Qiaoqiao] shyly covered her face. As graduation season approached, [He Qiaoqiao] and [Li Xing] excitedly threw their mortarboards into the air. The scene then shifted to 5 years ago, inside a restaurant.
0:4:59|0:5:16|After pressing the button, [Li Xing] stared at the other person in disbelief. The boss took the contract and looked at both of them. [He Qiaoqiao] picked up her bag and was about to leave, but then turned to look at [Li Xing]. Then, her index finger slowly approached him, causing the corners of [Li Xing]'s mouth to lift into a smile.
0:5:18|0:5:34|She looked at Li Xing's eyes with a complex expression for a long time, He Qiaoqiao turned and left, leaving Li Xing sitting in place. The scene shifted, He Qiaoqiao slowly walked towards a bridal shop on the street, the brand she mentioned to Li Xing when they broke up - Lan Yu.
0:5:34|0:5:46|She looked at the wedding dress in the shop window, then picked up her camera and took a photo through the glass. The photo slowly slid out, and she looked down at it for a long time as the scene gradually faded away.
0:5:47|0:6:4|With the music playing, the words "Breakup Contract" slowly appear on the screen, one day several years later. [He Qiaoqiao] opens the cabinet, takes out the bottles and jars inside, then she unscrews the bottle cap, gathers the bottles with her hands, and squats in front of the toilet.
0:6:5|0:6:23|One by one, pills are thrown into the toilet by [He Qiaoqiao]. She sighs with relief, ceremoniously closes the toilet lid, and presses the flush button. As the water flows away, she can't help but laugh, then picks up the phone on the sink to make a call.
0:6:28|0:6:33|[He Qiaoqiao] lifts the lid of the soup bowl, savoring it carefully, as [Mao Mao] looks at her expectantly.
0:6:43|0:6:48|[Mao Mao] laughed on the side, [He Qiaoqiao] also forced a smile at [Mao Mao] twice, then walked away.
0:6:51|0:6:57|Years later, [Li Xing] has also become the head chef of a high-end restaurant, and a waiter brings a dish to [Li Xing]'s table.
0:6:58|0:7:9|[Li Xing] puts the finishing touches on the dishes. Meanwhile, [He Qiaoqiao] and [Mao Mao] arrive at another restaurant, where [He Qiaoqiao] carefully inspects the spaghetti.
0:7:13|0:7:20|[He Qiaoqiao] spins her finger around the plate filled with food.
0:7:31|0:7:52|[Mao Mao] responded awkwardly. On the other side, [Li Xing] was skillfully cutting fish in the kitchen. As he poured the sauce, [He Qiaoqiao] picked up a piece of raw fish. She put the raw fish into her mouth, savoring it carefully as she chewed.
0:8:0|0:8:5|In the kitchen, [Li Xing] watches the chef cutting fish and casually picks up the sliced fish.
0:9:1|0:9:7|[He Qiaoqiao] ran to check her phone messages. She put down the phone and picked up the medicine, with [Mao Mao] quickly rushing over when she saw.
0:11:1|0:11:19|[He Qiaoqiao] gave Mao Mao a disdainful look as she started eating noodles. Her phone vibrated, and Li Xing sent a message: "Call me back when you can." Proudly, He Qiaoqiao showed the message to Mao Mao.
0:11:53|0:12:16|She carefully tore open the packaging and gently applied it to [Mao Mao]'s wound. [He Qiaoqiao] returned to the bedroom and happily dialed the phone. On the other end, [Li Xing] wrapped in a towel, walked out of the bathroom while drying his hair, it was a call from [He Qiaoqiao]. [Li Xing] quickly picked up the phone and answered it.
0:12:19|0:12:27|[Li Xing] hesitated for a moment.
0:13:33|0:13:42|Feeling regretful about her previous reaction, [He Qiaoqiao] then entered the living room. She took down the freshly baked plates and carefully wrapped them in newspapers.
0:13:43|0:14:1|Accompanied by the landing of the plane, [He Qiaoqiao] arrived in Beijing. In the bustling city, she carried her suitcase to the entrance of a high-end restaurant. Running, she suddenly stopped at the entrance, tidied up her slightly messy hair, sighed, and walked into the restaurant with her suitcase.
0:14:1|0:14:21|At the entrance of the restaurant stood a freshly designed signboard, with "Ruiju Art Plan" written on it. Inside the restaurant, [He Qiaoqiao] chose a seat by the window. The waiter came over with the menu.
0:14:36|0:14:42|The waiter was impressed by her gaze, bowed and left.
0:14:58|0:15:19|He posted the menu on the cabinet, in the restaurant: [He Qiaoqiao] looked at the covered soup bowl, sighed, smiled as she lifted the lid, then closed her eyes and lowered her head to smell. Just then, [Li Xing] in a new suit walked out, [He Qiaoqiao] still immersed in the aroma of the soup, unaware of [Li Xing].
0:15:19|0:15:38|[Li Xing] walked towards [He Qiaoqiao], pulled out a chair and sat across from her. [He Qiaoqiao] gazed at her long-lost ex-boyfriend, and the two exchanged a smile. Then [He Qiaoqiao]'s smile froze a bit. Seeing this, [Li Xing] gestured with his eyes for [He Qiaoqiao] to drink the soup. [He Qiaoqiao] picked up the spoon and tasted it.
0:16:30|0:16:37|[Li Xing] gentlemanly pulled out a chair, [Zhou Rui] thanked him, and [He Qiaoqiao] sat down awkwardly.
0:17:1|0:17:6|[Li Xing] finished speaking and kissed [Zhou Rui]. [He Qiaoqiao] looked a bit unhappy, and [Zhou Rui] asked with concern:
0:17:27|0:17:37|[He Qiaoqiao] took a sip of the soup, then furrowed her brows. After carefully tasting it, she looked at [Li Xing].
0:17:47|0:17:53|She continued speaking, facing [Li Xing]'s gaze.
0:18:43|0:18:59|[Zhou Rui] accidentally knocked over the gift of [He Qiaoqiao] in front of the bridal shop. [Li Xing] helped his fianc√©e open the car door, and the two walked hand in hand. [He Qiaoqiao] closed the car door and followed closely. When they arrived at the shop door, she was a bit surprised. [He Qiaoqiao] followed the couple into the bridal shop.
0:19:37|0:19:45|[He Qiaoqiao] and [Li Xing] glared at each other in anger, and [Zhou Rui] quickly stepped in to defuse the situation.
0:20:12|0:20:18|[Li Xing] personally selected the wedding dress, and when [He Qiaoqiao] saw this scene, her eyebrows were raised.
0:20:25|0:20:34|[Zhou Rui] followed the shop assistant to the fitting room, [Li Xing] stared at [He Qiaoqiao] with a smile that wasn't a smile. [He Qiaoqiao] squinted her eyes when she saw it, inside the fitting room:
0:21:35|0:21:41|[Zhou Rui] finished speaking, wiped [He Qiaoqiao]'s shoulder as she walked by, and picked up a glass of water to hand to [He Qiaoqiao].
0:23:14|0:23:24|[He Qiaoqiao] looked helplessly at the two of them. The scene shifted to a luxurious villa area, where the lake was accompanied by beautiful scenery, and an Audi with a Beijing license plate parked at the entrance of the villa area.
0:23:25|0:23:32|[He Qiaoqiao] watches the two of them kissing goodbye from the back seat, while [Zhou Rui] opens the car door and leaves.
0:23:37|0:23:46|[He Qiaoqiao] breathed a sigh of relief as [Li Xing] turned to look at her and started the car. The Audi drove on the highway, with [Li Xing] focused on driving while [He Qiaoqiao] let out a fake smile.
0:23:48|0:23:53|[Li Xing] put away his smile and gazed at the road ahead.
0:24:3|0:24:9|[Li Xing] smiled with relief, and [He Qiaoqiao] asked eagerly:
0:25:15|0:25:20|[He Qiaoqiao] glanced at [Li Xing] without saying a word, and the vehicle quickly arrived at an apartment.
0:25:48|0:26:1|[He Qiaoqiao] turned and walked away after hearing it, [Li Xing] caught up and hugged her into the room, the door opened. [Li Xing] pushed [He Qiaoqiao] into the room, and she looked around the room in surprise, covering her face with a hat.
0:27:8|0:27:14|[He Qiaoqiao] smiled and tried to enter the bathroom, but [Li Xing] suddenly reached out his arm to stop her.
0:27:35|0:27:41|[He Qiaoqiao] followed closely behind, and she rushed to the stove.
0:28:2|0:28:10|[He Qiaoqiao] reached out to hit, but [Li Xing] stopped her and discovered her wound.
0:28:12|0:28:19|[He Qiaoqiao] gave [Li Xing] a white look, [Li Xing] reached out his hand and stared at her without moving, [He Qiaoqiao] took out a band-aid from her jacket pocket and threw it onto [Li Xing]'s hand.
0:28:37|0:28:42|[He Qiaoqiao] winced in pain again and let out a cry, as [Li Xing], who was leaving, suddenly turned around.
0:28:45|0:28:53|[He Qiaoqiao] covers the gift box on the table, [Li Xing] throws the room key to [He Qiaoqiao], then he turns and leaves.
0:28:55|0:29:9|[He Qiaoqiao] watched him leave, pouted and threw the keys on the table. She then blew on her injured fingers, tore open the band-aid packaging, and suddenly froze as she thought of something, then he opened the carefully prepared gift box.
0:29:10|0:29:26|Seeing the broken plates in the box, she was very upset. She picked up the pieces of the plate and tried to put them back together. Unfortunately, what's done is done, the plate couldn't be restored. The scene then switches to [He Qiaoqiao] changing into pajamas and dancing wildly on [Li Xing]'s wedding bed.
0:29:26|0:29:44|She then opened the suitcase and dumped the clothes on the bed. She picked up her underwear and hung it on the hanger. The scene switched to the bathroom, where she brushed her teeth and placed skincare products on the shelf. She used the toothbrush as a toy and splashed water on the mirror. The lights in the room were all on, and [He Qiaoqiao] was tossing pillows on the sofa.
0:29:44|0:29:52|Before long, she started throwing tissues again, then went to the kitchen to get snacks. She peeled crayfish while talking on the phone.
0:30:5|0:30:10|[Mao Mao] sat up from the sofa with a face mask on, while [He Qiaoqiao] kept chewing food.
0:30:27|0:30:32|[He Qiaoqiao] listened and instantly threw away the crayfish, while spitting out the food in her mouth.
0:30:41|0:30:58|[He Qiaoqiao] enjoyed a relaxing moment in the bathtub with her eyes closed, then she moved to the living room to practice yoga. Stretching her left hand forward and holding her right foot with her right hand, she soon fell asleep on the sofa.
0:31:0|0:31:14|The next day, [Li Xing] paced in front of the car as if waiting for someone. A taxi pulled up and he hailed it, then walked around to the side and opened the door for [He Qiaoqiao] to get out.
0:31:19|0:31:25|[Zhou Rui] waved to [He Qiaoqiao] from across the street, and [He Qiaoqiao] awkwardly waved back.
0:33:34|0:33:42|[Mao Mao] hung up the phone, ran forward to snatch the bag from the man's hand, the male guest immediately took it back, [Mao Mao] coquettishly said, and then took back the bag.
0:33:55|0:34:3|Standing in front of the mirror, she was adjusting her clothes, looking at herself in the mirror with her hands crossed in front of her chest.
0:34:3|0:34:20|Encouraged, [He Qiaoqiao] nodded slightly, picked up the bag beside her and rummaged through it. She took out a bottle of imported liquor that she had prepared, stared at it for a while, then carefully unscrewed the cap. After opening the bottle, she closed her eyes and took a sniff, only to be repelled by the strong smell of alcohol.
0:34:20|0:34:31|He Qiaoqiao took a big gulp of the wine in the bottle, and after drinking in the living room, Li Xing, who had been drinking, poked her head out, while Zhou Rui sat on the sofa with her back to her, reading a magazine.
0:34:32|0:34:37|[He Qiaoqiao] retracted her head, then leaned out her whole body, slowly pacing with her right hand against the wall.
0:34:40|0:34:57|[Li Xing] left the sofa and moved closer to [He Qiaoqiao]. She suddenly took off her coat to reveal a camisole dress, which surprised [Li Xing]. [He Qiaoqiao] raised her delicate hand and placed the other's hand on her fragrant shoulder, her eyes filled with spring as she stared intently at [Li Xing]. Suddenly, [Li Xing]'s hand slid downwards.
0:34:59|0:35:9|[He Qiaoqiao] still doesn't give up, seizing the opportunity to grab [Li Xing]'s face and trying to kiss him forcefully. [Li Xing] keeps dodging and backing away, the two of them in the living room resembling a tango dance, with one on the offensive,
0:35:9|0:35:17|A figure dodging, they turn around and pass by each other, [He Qiaoqiao] still doesn't give up, [Li Xing] stares at her as she keeps twisting, forcing [He Qiaoqiao] to fall.
0:35:17|0:35:32|Suddenly, with a swift movement, [Li Xing] bent down and embraced her. As [Li Xing]'s face slowly approached, [He Qiaoqiao] also closed her eyes slowly. Just as they were about to kiss, [He Qiaoqiao] suddenly opened her eyes and mouth, and [Li Xing] caught a whiff of alcohol from her mouth, then let go of her hand.
0:35:49|0:36:2|[He Qiaoqiao] took out the carefully prepared gift from the kitchen, tidied her hair and walked to [Li Xing]. Then, with a sudden burst of energy, she pushed [Li Xing] down onto the sofa with the gift. She then sat down next to him, maintaining her gaze without saying a word.
0:36:4|0:36:15|[Li Xing] looked at the gift in his hand and smiled. Then he stood up from the sofa with the gift, pretending to look around. When [He Qiaoqiao] wasn't paying attention, he suddenly ran past her.
0:36:18|0:36:25|[He Qiaoqiao] turned to look at [Li Xing], who kept walking away. As [Li Xing] left, [He Qiaoqiao] looked regretful and shook her head abruptly.
0:36:26|0:36:31|The stage lights up, and the Chef King Competition begins.
0:38:42|0:38:48|Applause continued on the field, with the opponents also applauding and praising.
0:38:55|0:39:6|[He Qiaoqiao] is very happy. She takes out a camera from her backpack and stands in front of the TV, taking pictures of herself and [Li Xing].
0:39:6|0:39:22|[He Qiaoqiao] captured the moment and took a selfie with [Li Xing] on TV. Outside the studio, [He Qiaoqiao] rushed to the recording scene with her backpack. She walked through the corridor to the backstage, but her happiness was interrupted by a conversation.
0:39:57|0:40:5|[He Qiaoqiao] felt uncomfortable because of the loud shouting.
0:40:52|0:41:0|[He Qiaoqiao] sat on the roadside, feeling sad, when suddenly [Li Xing] called.
0:41:30|0:41:40|[Li Xing] happily hung up the phone, [He Qiaoqiao] was a bit flustered and quickly called back to [Mao Mao].
0:42:22|0:42:29|The crowd cheered and applauded at the words, making [Zhou Rui] very happy to see this scene.
0:43:17|0:43:25|[Li Xing] turned around and pressed [Mao Mao] with his body.
0:43:42|0:44:7|[Li Xing] is lying on top of [Mao Mao]. Their hands are pressed together again. [Zhou Rui] is very surprised as she sees [Li Xing] using [Mao Mao]'s waist for support. In the end, [Li Xing] can't hold on any longer and falls to the side. The outcome is clear, as [Mao Mao] stands up with an incredulous expression on her face.
0:46:37|0:46:43|[He Qiaoqiao] was about to kiss [Mao Mao], but was interrupted by a series of gasps, as it turned out [Li Xing] and [Zhou Rui] were kissing passionately.
0:46:57|0:47:12|Thank you again, the advantage will be delivered soon, hurry up. As everyone cheers, [Li Xing] secretly looks at [He Qiaoqiao].
0:47:22|0:47:30|Friends left one by one, leaving only [He Qiaoqiao], [Li Xing], and their partners.
0:47:32|0:47:39|[Li Xing] was a bit puzzled. He glanced at [Zhou Rui] beside him and then walked up to shake hands with [Mao Mao].
0:47:41|0:47:47|[Zhou Rui] waved goodbye to [He Qiaoqiao]. She watched as [Li Xing] got on the car.
0:47:49|0:47:57|He Qiaoqiao's expression instantly turned cold, Mao Mao and He Qiaoqiao stood on the roadside watching the car slowly drive away.
0:48:25|0:48:39|The staff were placing [He Qiaoqiao]'s work in an orderly manner, while [Mao Mao] urged her to sign. But she was staring blankly ahead. It turned out to be a painting.
0:48:43|0:48:57|[Mao Mao] walked to the side of [He Qiaoqiao], turned to look at the painting in front of her. The horizon divided the picture into two halves, with the sky above and the sea below, and [He Qiaoqiao] just watched quietly.
0:49:27|0:49:38|The phone rang, and a message from [Li Xing] came in, saying he thought [Mao Mao] was great. With someone to accompany [He Qiaoqiao], he could feel at ease. [He Qiaoqiao] looked at [Mao Mao] and angrily threw the phone to the ground.
0:49:38|0:49:55|[Mao Mao] picked up the phone from the ground, while [He Qiaoqiao] returned to [Li Xing]'s bridal chamber. As she was tidying up her clothes, the phone rang again, with a message from [Mao Mao]. It informed [He Qiaoqiao] that although the tide had receded, it would rise again in a few hours. With her chin resting on the phone, [He Qiaoqiao] seemed to be lost in thought.
0:49:55|0:50:8|She put down her phone and started packing her luggage, as the sound of the door opening came from outside.
0:50:13|0:50:29|[Li Xing] looked a bit flustered after hearing that, turned to look at [He Qiaoqiao] upstairs, and she silently lowered her head.
0:50:34|0:50:42|The night alley was particularly quiet, with [He Qiaoqiao] and [Li Xing] walking side by side in the alley.
0:50:44|0:50:57|The two looked at the restaurant on the side of the road, with the sign "Red Leaf Stone Nan" written on it. [Li Xing] looked at [He Qiaoqiao], took big steps towards the restaurant, [He Qiaoqiao] was stunned for a moment, and followed along. The time went back to 5 years ago.
0:50:57|0:51:5|It was when they broke up, pouring rain that day, [Li Xing] and [He Qiaoqiao] arrived at the restaurant with an umbrella.
0:51:8|0:51:15|[Li Xing] was gulping down a bottle of Arctic Ocean soda, while [He Qiaoqiao] was picking at the cold dishes absentmindedly, seeming preoccupied.
0:51:16|0:51:20|[Li Xing] was eating cold dishes while looking at [He Qiaoqiao] beside him, with a happy expression on his face.
0:51:25|0:51:33|The boss walked in and [Li Xing], taking the opportunity, stood up and walked to [He Qiaoqiao]'s side. [Li Xing] cleared his throat and suddenly knelt down on one knee.
0:51:45|0:52:1|[Li Xing] slowly took out a ring after speaking. [He Qiaoqiao] hesitated between the ring and [Li Xing]'s face, while [Li Xing] looked at the other person expectantly.
0:52:39|0:52:47|[He Qiaoqiao] hesitated to speak, she took the ring and examined it carefully.
0:53:52|0:53:59|He immediately turned his head at the words, his eyes fixed on the ceiling, while [He Qiaoqiao] stared ahead with a blank expression.
0:54:7|0:54:25|Outside the restaurant, it was pouring rain. [He Qiaoqiao] ran out from inside, suppressing her emotions until they suddenly burst out, tears mixing with the rain. She covered her mouth and left. Back in the present, the restaurant owner took out the contract from the exquisite wooden box that the two signed when they broke up.
0:54:36|0:54:52|The boss chuckled at the words and handed over the contract in his hand. The two looked at the contract on the table, then at each other. [He Qiaoqiao] suddenly picked up the contract and tore it up, causing the boss to furrow his brow.
0:55:0|0:55:5|The boss helplessly crossed his arms upon hearing this, [He Qiaoqiao] looked at [Li Xing].
0:55:31|0:55:39|Her eyes welled up with tears, the tears swirling in her eyes as she turned to look at [Li Xing], who was also staring at her.
0:55:40|0:55:48|The restaurant owner lowered his head at the words, [He Qiaoqiao] paused, trying hard to control her emotions.
0:56:5|0:56:12|[He Qiaoqiao] got up and left, [Li Xing] stopped her, picking up the envelope on the table.
0:56:13|0:56:22|[He Qiaoqiao] remained silent, tears welling up in her eyes, as [Li Xing] gently guided her back to her seat.
0:56:27|0:56:33|Master Nan took the envelope from [Li Xing] and opened it, smiling as he read the contents.
0:56:34|0:56:51|Passing the invitation to seated [He Qiaoqiao], she looked closely and froze instantly. It turned out to be a wedding invitation with [He Qiaoqiao] and [Li Xing]'s names printed on it. She looked at [Li Xing] in disbelief.
0:57:16|0:57:24|[He Qiaoqiao] was greatly surprised by everything in front of her, and she asked eagerly:
0:57:47|0:57:53|[He Qiaoqiao] turned her head to sniffle, then locked eyes with [Li Xing].
0:58:17|0:58:35|Facing [Li Xing], [He Qiaoqiao] reverted back to her petulant self, giving [Li Xing] a disdainful look before turning her head to avoid eye contact. [He Qiaoqiao] turned back, looking at [Li Xing] with a sense of grievance, as [Li Xing] attempted to repeat his old tricks, only to have his hands dodged by the other party.
0:58:40|0:58:47|Outside the alley, [Li Xing] catches up with [He Qiaoqiao], grabbing her and the two of them gaze at each other under the tree.
0:58:48|0:58:59|[Li Xing] looked into [He Qiaoqiao]'s eyes and said, [He Qiaoqiao] wanted to break free after listening, but was forcefully pulled back by the other party, then [Li Xing] kissed her.
0:59:1|0:59:6|Time seemed to stand still as [Li Xing]'s hands slowly reached around the other's waist.
0:59:7|0:59:23|The elevator door slowly opened, and the entangled couple walked out from inside. [He Qiaoqiao] wanted to escape, but was caught by [Li Xing] and felt like a little lamb. Pressed against the door, the suppressed emotions of 5 years were released in this moment, and the two happily chased each other in the corridor.
0:59:24|0:59:30|[Li Xing] stops [He Qiaoqiao] in front of the door and says to him seriously:
0:59:37|0:59:52|[He Qiaoqiao] kissed [Li Xing] through the keyhole, then opened the door. [Li Xing] kissed her again. He tried to enter the room, but was rejected by her.
0:59:57|1:0:15|She happily rolled against the wall, carefully recalling the recent events. She couldn't help but laugh again, feeling an unprecedented joy. Suddenly, she opened her bag, took out her phone, and dialed [Mao Mao]'s number, eager to share her feelings with the other person.
1:0:43|1:0:53|[Li Xing] walked towards [Mao Mao], suddenly grabbed his bag while he was handling the procedures. [Mao Mao] chased after him and realized the other person was waiting for him.
1:1:22|1:1:28|She suddenly sneezed while sitting on the sofa, coughing and covering her mouth with her right hand.
1:1:35|1:1:41|[He Qiaoqiao] looked at the pool of blood in her palm, placed it back in its original position, her lips turning pale, and struggled to breathe as she held the phone in her left hand.
1:1:42|1:1:48|In the previous second, she was happy, but suddenly she seemed like a different person, becoming sad.
1:1:58|1:2:6|Silently hanging up the phone, the restless [He Qiaoqiao] looked nervously towards the door, and the scene gradually faded as she turned her head.
1:2:14|1:2:30|[Li Xing] lowered his head to cook, his emotions unreadable. [He Qiaoqiao] arrived at Peking University Shougang Hospital. In the examination room, the doctor looked at [He Qiaoqiao]'s test report. Her expression sitting across from him was very distressing. The doctor sighed and said, [He Qiaoqiao] remained silent.
1:2:48|1:2:54|Alone and helpless, [He Qiaoqiao] sheds tears while holding medicine.
1:3:11|1:3:32|She stood with her back to the camera, her expression hidden. In the evening, [He Qiaoqiao] walked heavily on the sidewalk, looking very lonely.
1:3:35|1:3:50|[Li Xing] temporarily left the celebration party, took out his phone and called [He Qiaoqiao]. [He Qiaoqiao], who was walking on the street, glanced at her phone. On the other end of the call, [Li Xing] looked expectant, but she didn't answer the phone. With a deep sadness in her eyes, [He Qiaoqiao] continued walking with a heavy heart.
1:3:50|1:4:3|Unable to reach [Li Xing] on the phone, he put down his phone, his expression somewhat frozen. Outside the bridal chamber of [Li Xing], [He Qiaoqiao] dragged a suitcase out of the room. She stood there for a long time, as if bidding farewell to everything in front of her.
1:4:3|1:4:20|She closed the door and hesitated to leave the room that belonged to her and [Li Xing] in the future, which was gradually becoming distant. In the end, she chose to turn around and leave. From coming alone to leaving alone, the only thing accompanying her seemed to be the suitcase by her side.
1:4:20|1:4:44|The scene shifts, with straight trees growing in the forest blocking some of the sky. Rows of tombstones are neatly arranged under the trees. [He Qiaoqiao] holds a bouquet of flowers, bends down in front of a tombstone, and gazes down at it. It seems like she is having a conversation with it. After speaking, [He Qiaoqiao] falls into a long silence, with her eyes lowered.
1:4:44|1:4:58|The sadness seemed to have been exhausted, fate played a big joke on her, but she couldn't laugh. Feeling hopeless, [Li Xing] hurriedly arrived at the door of the bridal chamber, took out his phone and answered the call.
1:5:8|1:5:15|[He Qiaoqiao] fell silent for a moment, then [Li Xing] turned and walked away, hanging up the phone.
1:5:17|1:5:25|Walking briskly, He Qiaoqiao hurried towards the exit, while Li Xing sat on a bench in the campus waiting for her. It was where their relationship began.
1:5:26|1:5:35|[He Qiaoqiao] walked towards [Li Xing], with a forced smile on her face. [Li Xing] didn't notice anything unusual about her, and looked at her with a smile on his face.
1:5:36|1:6:7|[Li Xing] stood up, holding his hands, and turned to face [He Qiaoqiao]. Slowly, [Li Xing] revealed the small box in his palm, and he knelt down to open it. [He Qiaoqiao] looked uncertain for a moment, then smiled. Seeing her smile, [Li Xing] also smiled.
1:6:30|1:6:36|[Li Xing] looked somewhat incredulous. His tone gradually became more serious.
1:6:46|1:6:55|[He Qiaoqiao] is trying hard to conceal her emotions.
1:7:15|1:7:24|[Li Xing] frowned, while [He Qiaoqiao] pondered for a moment.
1:7:33|1:7:44|[Li Xing] made a final attempt to persuade [He Qiaoqiao], who smiled and nodded. [Li Xing] gave up the struggle, turned around with anger and disappointment, and walked away.
1:7:46|1:7:54|[He Qiaoqiao] seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, but to her surprise, [Li Xing] suddenly turned back and walked angrily towards the other person.
1:8:6|1:8:18|[He Qiaoqiao] silently endured the other party's outburst, while [Li Xing] angrily stormed off without looking back. [He Qiaoqiao] held back her tears, took a deep breath, and looked up at the sky.
1:8:35|1:8:43|At the Chef King Competition, [Li Xing] stared heavily at the cutting board in front of him. In the alley, [He Qiaoqiao] once again arrived at the Hongye Restaurant.
1:8:55|1:9:11|[He Qiaoqiao] slowly closed her eyes upon hearing the words, sitting quietly. [Li Xing] returned to the bridal chamber, looking at the scene in the living room, seemingly reminiscing about the moments they shared. He looked up the stairs, where the girl who used to argue with him seemed to be standing.
1:9:12|1:9:26|He Qiaoqiao touched the furniture, carefully feeling the traces that had once existed. He walked slowly towards the kitchen, looking around, and found a box of band-aids on the dining table. The innocent and mischievous girl always had the habit of carrying band-aids with her.
1:9:26|1:9:35|[Li Xing] walked slowly, carefully picking it up. His left index finger was injured in the competition and still wrapped in a band-aid.
1:9:35|1:9:55|The girl who was taking care of him has already left. He slowly picks up the band-aid, turns it over, and on the back of the band-aid is a smiley face drawn by [He Qiaoqiao], as if reminding him to take care of himself. [Li Xing] then arrives at the Red Leaf Restaurant, only to find that it is already closed.
1:9:55|1:10:6|He looked a bit frustrated, furrowed his brow and turned to leave. At that moment, the restaurant owner, Master Nan, walked out from the shop. Li Xing turned his head to look at the owner.
1:10:17|1:10:32|[Li Xing] scanned the menu, unable to make a choice for a moment. [Li Xing] looked at the boss in confusion upon hearing the words.
1:10:38|1:10:44|The boss listened as [Li Xing] slowly said:
1:10:55|1:11:2|Quickly looking at the menu, trying to find any hidden clues from it, it turns out that [He Qiaoqiao] has been here all these years.
1:11:13|1:11:29|Five menus put together to form 5 characters, I am by your side, [Li Xing] lost in thought, he suddenly enlightened, got up and ran out of the restaurant. [Li Xing] arrived at the exhibition hall panting, and asked the staff next to him:
1:11:38|1:11:42|He Qiaoqiao took out his phone from the pocket of his jacket as he walked, with an anxious look on his face, and dialed a number.
1:11:44|1:11:58|The phone call was not answered, [Li Xing] looked around anxiously, then hung up and put the phone back in his pocket. His attention was caught by an exhibit - a broken plate with a large crack splitting it in half.
1:11:59|1:12:9|Even after being repaired, the cracks are still clearly visible. This exhibit was named "Me" by the creator, and [Li Xing] seemed to have guessed something as he looked flustered and slowly walked away.
1:12:9|1:12:28|Suddenly starting to accelerate and run, amidst the roar the plane slowly takes off, the Oriental Pearl Tower stands proudly by the Huangpu River, on the cross-sea bridge, cars are coming and going, [Li Xing] arrives in a taxi in Shanghai, with a heavy heart, the disappearance of [He Qiaoqiao] has made him very anxious.
1:12:29|1:12:50|He then arrived at the entrance of He Qiaoqiao's studio, where life garbage and cardboard boxes were scattered outside. As he approached, he found that the house was for rent. He knocked on the door and peeked inside. The room was empty, with no sign of He Qiaoqiao.
1:13:0|1:13:16|[Mao Mao] pretended to have poor signal and intentionally hung up the phone. [Li Xing] stood outside [He Qiaoqiao]'s studio, deep in thought, before leaving. Back in Beijing, [Li Xing] drove swiftly on the road, with the street scenes continuously receding behind. Inside the exhibition hall, [Mao Mao] was counting the exhibits with the staff.
1:13:16|1:13:22|[Li Xing] slowly appears and walks towards [Mao Mao], who seems to have a realization and looks back.
1:13:33|1:13:40|He Qiaoqiao kept a close eye on [Mao Mao], while Li Xing tried to control his emotions.
1:13:57|1:14:10|[Mao Mao] looked at [Li Xing], who picked up a plate from the warehouse. [Mao Mao] looked incredulous.
1:15:38|1:15:45|[Mao Mao] lowered her head and cried in pain, while [Li Xing] walked up and grabbed his face.
1:15:58|1:16:10|He recalled what [He Qiaoqiao] had said, speeding down the hospital corridor. [Li Xing] rushed anxiously to the triage desk, asking the night shift nurse, who lowered her head to search.
1:16:12|1:16:26|[Li Xing] turned and walked away upon hearing this, anxiously searching the corridor for the room. He longed to meet [He Qiaoqiao], wanting to know her current condition. Eventually, he looked through the glass on the door and saw [He Qiaoqiao] sleeping on the hospital bed.
1:16:26|1:16:44|[Li Xing] gently pushed the door open and walked in, greeted by various medical instruments surrounding [He Qiaoqiao], who was lying on the bed in a patient gown with her head turned to the side. [Li Xing] stared at her and slowly approached, his face filled with sorrow. The once lively and innocent girl was now worn out by illness, her face showing signs of weakness.
1:16:44|1:17:1|[Li Xing] bent down to grab [He Qiaoqiao]'s hand and slowly squatted down. He dared not make a loud noise, afraid of waking up the girl on the sickbed. He just quietly watched her, as if wanting to engrave her in his heart. [He Qiaoqiao]'s lips turned pale, and [Li Xing] saw everything.
1:17:1|1:17:18|Tears welled up in his eyes, he slowly turned his head to the side, not daring to cry too loudly, hesitating to believe everything in front of him. Beside the sickbed, [Li Xing] found a photo album, he slowly picked it up, carefully examining it with eyes full of disbelief.
1:17:18|1:17:39|It seemed like he could anticipate the contents of this album. He pursed his lips, carefully opened it, and started to look at it earnestly. The first page contained two photos, capturing his daily life. Tears silently rolled down [Li Xing]'s eyes as he looked at [He Qiaoqiao] on the bed, then he turned to the next page, which was a graduation photo.
1:17:39|1:17:56|The footage captures their transition from school to society. Flipping to the next page in the album, the photo shows [He Qiaoqiao] in the coveted Lan Yu wedding dress. He took these photos from behind the shop window, and [Li Xing]'s emotions gradually crumbled along with the photos, as he knelt on the ground in agony, sobbing.
1:17:56|1:18:12|He saw the photo of the two kissing in the album, a beautiful memory before they separated. Then he saw [He Qiaoqiao] fighting against the illness in a selfie, she was wearing a hospital gown in the photo, but always had a smile on her face. [Li Xing] cried silently.
1:18:12|1:18:20|At this moment, the strong man is so vulnerable, outside the hospital, Li Xing's car is blocking the entrance causing a traffic jam.
1:18:58|1:19:15|[Li Xing] collapsed on the roadside, crying bitterly. His apology seemed to have come a bit late. Passersby forgave him, but what about [He Qiaoqiao] in the hospital room? Can she hear it? At Peking University Shougang Hospital.
1:19:28|1:19:46|Three round lunch boxes are placed in a row, filled with tempting food that smells delicious. [He Qiaoqiao] has a big appetite, picks up the chopsticks to pick up the food, while [Mao Mao] looks at her expectantly. [He Qiaoqiao] chews the food carefully after putting it into her mouth, then nods in satisfaction at [Mao Mao].
1:20:18|1:20:25|[He Qiaoqiao] looked at the dishes in front of her, feeling a bit silent. After a moment of contemplation, [He Qiaoqiao] said:
1:20:26|1:20:38|She paused and continued speaking. [Mao Mao] turned her head away without asking further. [He Qiaoqiao] looked at him with a worried expression and asked.
1:20:54|1:21:5|In a deserted restaurant late at night, only the kitchen lights were still on. [Li Xing] added caviar to the dishes, carefully preparing a bento for [He Qiaoqiao].
1:21:8|1:21:31|Sitting on the hospital bed, [He Qiaoqiao] looked at [Mao Mao] with surprise, eating the delicate food in the lunchbox. She said thoughtfully, "A radish flower is garnished on the meat, it's still [Li Xing] preparing the meal." [He Qiaoqiao] looked at the exquisite food in the lunchbox, picked up the meat and tasted it carefully, enduring the stomach pain to take a bite.
1:21:34|1:21:49|In the kitchen, busy [Li Xing] takes out his phone. [Mao Mao] texts him that [He Qiaoqiao] can't eat today. [Li Xing] feels worried, and in the hospital room, [He Qiaoqiao] starts retching.
1:21:56|1:22:3|In the kitchen, [Li Xing] is preparing desserts for [He Qiaoqiao], with the lunch box filled with delicious strawberry cake and taro cake.
1:22:7|1:22:20|On the other side, [He Qiaoqiao] covered her mouth, trying to adjust her state, and handed out the lunch box. [Mao Mao] looked at her with a worried expression.
1:22:23|1:22:46|[He Qiaoqiao] shook her head, tears slowly falling. [Mao Mao] felt very sorry, but didn't know how to comfort her, so she silently lowered her head to tidy up the lunch boxes. Determined, [He Qiaoqiao] had a resolute look in her eyes. Hearing this, [Mao Mao] immediately walked to [He Qiaoqiao]'s side and said to her:
1:22:47|1:22:54|[He Qiaoqiao], with tears still in her eyes, had a firm determination to leave the hospital. She looked at [Mao Mao] and held his hand, saying:
1:23:3|1:23:46|[He Qiaoqiao] held [Mao Mao]'s hands. [Mao Mao] turned his head to the side, and [He Qiaoqiao] choked up, saying: [He Qiaoqiao] looked up at [Mao Mao], who sniffed and looked out the window. He didn't want to face it all. [He Qiaoqiao] said with relief: The more she thought about it, the sadder she felt.
1:23:46|1:23:54|[Mao Mao] knows the relationship between the two, and he is sadder than [He Qiaoqiao].
1:23:55|1:24:2|[Mao Mao] turned his head to the side, trying hard to hold back his emotions and tears, while [He Qiaoqiao] looked at him pleadingly.
1:24:4|1:24:17|Sunlight streamed into the ward as the two held hands and gazed at each other in silence. [He Qiaoqiao], who was discharged from the hospital, sat quietly at the bar in the Red Leaf Restaurant. She caressed the table, then stood in front of the restaurant door.
1:24:19|1:24:43|She looked back at the familiar surroundings of the restaurant. Then she pushed the door open and took a step of her own, the afternoon sun shining through the leaves with extra gentleness. People were coming and going on the street, [He Qiaoqiao] walked in the alley, looking at everything in front of her, as if bidding farewell.
1:24:43|1:24:55|[Li Xing] quietly appeared behind [He Qiaoqiao], closely following her as they walked through the streets and alleys. She looked at the scenery along the road, occasionally reaching out to touch the branches and leaves beside her.
1:24:55|1:25:12|[Li Xing] silently followed behind, observing every move of [He Qiaoqiao], looking at the girl sitting on the bench. Despite being of similar age, the two faced completely different destinies. She hesitated for a moment and stopped in her tracks, with [Li Xing] stopping as well.
1:25:12|1:25:24|Watching [He Qiaoqiao] cheering herself up, [Li Xing] saw [He Qiaoqiao] picking clothes in the store through the window. Her body could no longer support her vigorous movements. She struggled to push open the glass store door and walked out.
1:25:25|1:25:42|[Li Xing] walked towards [He Qiaoqiao], who slowly stopped in her tracks upon seeing him. The two gazed at each other for a long time, until [Li Xing] suddenly smiled. His smile was contagious, and [He Qiaoqiao] found herself smiling too, nodding in agreement after a moment and saying:
1:25:53|1:26:0|[He Qiaoqiao] avoided eye contact, she was about to leave but was called back. [Li Xing] gently said:
1:26:13|1:26:28|[Li Xing] smiled and shook his head, saying to her. [Li Xing]'s attitude surprised [He Qiaoqiao] a little, and the two of them entered the bridal chamber at night.
1:26:40|1:26:46|He opened the lid, revealing the long-lost smile of [He Qiaoqiao].
1:26:57|1:27:15|She scooped up a small spoonful, just as she brought it to her lips, she stopped. The pain in her body made it hard for her to breathe. She struggled to swallow the porridge, with [Li Xing] looking at her expectantly. In order not to disappoint him, she took another sip.
1:27:15|1:27:24|[He Qiaoqiao] couldn't bear it anymore, the physical pain made her vomit all the food. [Li Xing] took out a tissue and handed it to her.
1:27:37|1:27:45|[Li Xing] turned his head to look at the other person. [He Qiaoqiao] was startled by the ringing sound, and [Li Xing] snatched the phone away.
1:27:58|1:28:13|[Li Xing] handed her a glass of water, and [He Qiaoqiao] took it. She struggled to swallow the medicine, and [Li Xing] didn't expose her lie. He just quietly watched her as [He Qiaoqiao] picked up the spoon again, not wanting to disappoint the other person's kindness.
1:28:14|1:28:31|The porridge was right in front of her, but she couldn't bring herself to eat it. Seeing this, Li Xing quickly intervened. He held He Qiaoqiao's hand and said, He Qiaoqiao looked a bit dejected.
1:28:55|1:29:18|[Li Xing]'s words were like sharp knives, piercing [He Qiaoqiao]'s heart. Unable to control her emotions, she quickly picked up her bag and left. [Li Xing] stood still, unable to hide his emotions, tears slowly streaming down his face. He lowered his head, choked up, unable to speak. The stage lights came on, and the cooking competition began.
1:29:40|1:29:55|At the beginning, [He Qiaoqiao] and [Mao Mao] also arrived at the scene. They were applauding for [Li Xing] in the audience. On the stage, [Li Xing] had a calm expression. He picked up a tomato with his left hand and weighed it, while [He Qiaoqiao] nervously watched him, anticipating his next move.
1:29:56|1:30:8|[Li Xing] puts unpeeled tomatoes into boiling water. He simmers them over low heat to remove the skin, then skillfully dices the salted bamboo shoots and peeled tomatoes. Other chefs in the kitchen also demonstrate their abilities.
1:30:8|1:30:17|Using familiar tools to create exquisite dishes, [Li Xing] on stage attentively catches the eye of [He Qiaoqiao], leaving her in a trance.
1:31:2|1:31:15|[Li Xing] brought the bowl of soup to [He Qiaoqiao]'s front, bent down slowly, that was the soup [He Qiaoqiao] was most familiar with, and the container holding it was an aluminum lunch box used in high school for food.
1:31:38|1:31:45|[Li Xing] scooped up a spoonful of soup, gently blew on it, and then slowly brought it to [He Qiaoqiao]'s lips, saying:
1:31:52|1:31:59|[Li Xing] drank the soup under the expectant gaze. [Li Xing] looked a bit nervous, waiting for the outcome.
1:32:0|1:32:18|He Qiaoqiao nodded approvingly, as Li Xing opened the box in his hand. Inside lay a delicate diamond ring. His gaze was firm as he held the ring, but his hand trembled slightly. Zhou Rui took a deep breath, trying hard to control her emotions.
1:32:21|1:32:41|[Li Xing]'s firm tone moved [He Qiaoqiao], who seemed to be struggling. She finally broke free from her self-imposed confinement and stopped closing off her heart. [Li Xing] stared blankly at the person in front of him. This time, [He Qiaoqiao] didn't hesitate, nodded in agreement, and all the audience in the audience stood up and applauded for them.
1:32:41|1:33:1|Amidst the enthusiastic applause, [Li Xing] picked up the ring, and all the audience stood up to applaud for them. Amidst the enthusiastic applause, [Li Xing] picked up the ring. After going through ups and downs, they finally completed the 5-year contract of breaking up at this moment. The moment the ring was put on the ring finger, all the troubles vanished into thin air.
1:33:1|1:33:18|[Li Xing] passionately kisses the back of [He Qiaoqiao]'s hand, leaving her feeling a bit dazed, afraid that it's all just a dream. They embrace tightly, their love for each other is unparalleled. [Li Xing] smiles happily, at this moment they become the center of attention for everyone, but in their eyes, there is only each other.
1:33:18|1:33:31|The night alley was slightly cold, [Li Xing] walked on the familiar road to the Red Leaf Restaurant. The warm light outside the restaurant was adorned with pots of plants placed outdoors. [Li Xing] crossed the small courtyard and arrived at the entrance of the restaurant.
1:33:31|1:33:40|He looked around through the glass door, [He Qiaoqiao] was busy at the bar. He pushed the door open and the sound caught [He Qiaoqiao]'s attention, she looked towards the door.
1:33:45|1:33:58|[Li Xing] withdrew his gaze at the words, taking in everything in the restaurant. The walls were covered with porcelain made by [He Qiaoqiao], ranging from plates to jars. [Li Xing] was stunned by the scene before him.
1:33:58|1:34:14|Looking somewhat puzzled at [He Qiaoqiao], [He Qiaoqiao] slowly approached [Li Xing] with two sets of bowls and chopsticks. [Li Xing] looked at her with a hint of heartache. The once lively and sunny girl was now weakened by illness, and [He Qiaoqiao] set down the bowls and chopsticks.
1:34:15|1:34:20|Looking at the dishes in front of her, [He Qiaoqiao] said:
1:34:24|1:34:50|[Li Xing] smiled after listening, picked up the chopsticks, lifted the bowl, picked up a piece of meat from the plate and put it in his mouth to savor. Looking at him, [He Qiaoqiao] asked with some anticipation, [Li Xing] nodded happily, [He Qiaoqiao] smiled a bit more on her face after listening, while [Li Xing] listened quietly.
1:34:52|1:34:56|[Li Xing] looked at the food in the bowl and chuckled, not responding to the other person's question.
1:35:4|1:35:11|Sensing the upcoming topic, [Li Xing] froze in expression.
1:35:45|1:35:54|[He Qiaoqiao] looked at the old photo and fell into memories.
1:36:38|1:36:44|[Li Xing] held back tears and asked with a trembling voice:
1:37:0|1:37:8|Li Xing, who learned the truth, cried like a child.
1:37:10|1:37:34|[Li Xing] tried hard to control his emotions. [He Qiaoqiao] approached [Li Xing] with a smile on her face, gently lifting the corners of his mouth with her index finger to make him smile.
1:37:37|1:37:46|[Li Xing] couldn't imagine [He Qiaoqiao] leaving like this, with a tumultuous heart but tears silently flowing down her face.
1:38:6|1:38:32|In the play, the often depicted separation and reunion in life is now happening right beside them, in front of their eyes. All emotions converge into a wordless embrace. Love and relationships in this world have always been bittersweet. Perhaps fate is cruel to them. Since the day he met [He Qiaoqiao], [Li Xing] fell in love at first sight. They met and fell in love in their youth.
1:38:39|1:39:8|However, [Li Xing] did not wait for the day when they would both have white hair. The beauty had already met an untimely end, like flowers fading away in the wind. Six months later, [Li Xing] took over the Red Leaf Restaurant, filled with everything related to him and [He Qiaoqiao]. The plates she made, the small items she collected, and their wedding photos were all neatly arranged by [Li Xing]. At this time, [He Qiaoqiao] had already left, and [Li Xing] was wearing a sweater, reading a book at the bar.
1:39:8|1:39:20|And at this moment, a guest happened to push the door open.
