0:0:48|0:0:59|As soon as the words fell, the workers who were about to start work in the old factory outside the river suddenly ran away. At this moment, a muffled thunder resounded through the sky, and fist-sized raindrops immediately hit the heavy cotton jackets.
0:1:1|0:1:27|In the crowded crowd, a young woman with a mushroom hairstyle is shaking off the rainwater under the eaves. As she looks up, a tall man brushes past her. In the half-studio, the young woman puts down her pen and looks towards the door. Soon after, the tall man stoops down and peeks in from the doorway.
0:1:33|0:1:52|The tall man handed the key to the young man sitting across the table, nodded and then turned to walk outside. The young woman, who had been smiling at him, had no choice but to pick up the documents on the table and head towards the workshop. Inside, three or four men were gathered together.
0:2:2|0:2:15|And not far from Old Zhang, a tall man was squatting on the ground, twisting screws on a machine. In the blink of an eye, it was finally time to get off work. Outside the factory, people were rushing towards the bus that had just arrived at the station.
0:2:15|0:2:24|The young woman in the queue was about to board the bus, but the next second, she was forcefully cut in by someone from the diagonal front and stepped onto the last available spot on the bus step.
0:2:26|0:2:47|The woman took a closer look and realized that the person was none other than the tall man. Whether intentional or coincidental, in the days that followed, the young woman would always brush past the tall man in various corners of the factory. In the deep winter, a tram slowly came to a stop on the desolate old streets of Shanghai.
0:2:47|0:2:56|Even though wearing heavy cotton coats, the passengers were still bent over by the cold wind blowing in their faces. As new passengers boarded, the tramcar started up again.
0:3:4|0:3:14|One day, the tall man who was speaking, sat on the tram and looked towards the back of the car, reminiscing.
0:3:35|0:3:48|In a bustling restaurant, a young woman rests her chin on her hands, calmly listening to the conversation between the owner and her son in front of her. Then she rubs her hands together through her gloves and stares blankly at the glass in front of her.
0:3:53|0:3:58|After Gu Manzhen finished speaking, Xu Shuhui didn't seem angry, and then lifted the teapot.
0:4:24|0:4:31|[Gu Manzhen] then slightly stood up and took out three pairs of chopsticks from the chopstick holder in the middle of the table.
0:4:34|0:4:39|Then, [Gu Manzhen] placed the end of the chopsticks that could be eaten into the cup that had just been filled with tea.
0:5:20|0:5:25|The obscure [Shen Shijun] did not make a move, but instead lifted the cup with both hands.
0:5:45|0:5:55|[Shen Shijun], who had just poured the wine, smiled awkwardly, then picked up his chopsticks and shyly tasted the dishes on the table. After the meal, the three of them walked into the rare winter sun.
0:6:25|0:6:31|Seeing [Gu Manzhen] smiling as she wiped the dirt off her face, [Shen Shijun] suddenly felt at a loss.
0:6:53|0:7:4|Speak up, the camera was handed to Shi Jun by Tong Xiaosheng. Manzhen had to bow her head and rummage through her bag for a comb.
0:7:14|0:7:30|Later, the three of them took a photo against the light. Manzhen grabbed [Xu Shuhui]'s arm and pulled her in front of her.
0:7:52|0:7:58|[Shi Cuizhi] took a drag on her cigarette and then took the camera from [Zhu Hongcai]'s hand, gesturing for him to come over.
0:8:14|0:8:37|[Shi Cuizhi] pressed the shutter twice. Just as Manzhen was feeling regretful, a drop of coldness fell on her face. Xu Shuhui first looked down at Manzhen's profile, then turned to look at the sky, where fine snowflakes began to dance, disturbing Xu Shuhui's heart and causing it to gradually fluctuate.
0:8:37|0:8:45|On the letter that was supposed to be written, Manzhen's name was written all over it. On the other side of the room, [Shi Cuizhi] spoke softly.
0:9:13|0:9:20|[Shi Cuizhi] turned and walked towards the door. Hearing [Gu Manzhen]'s name, [Shen Shijun] unconsciously followed.
0:9:45|0:9:49|[Shen Shijun] returned to the desk just before the book club was discovered.
0:10:8|0:10:23|In the middle of the night, a beam of light crossed the woods and shone straight onto the path. As it approached, a tall and thin figure was leaning over, searching for something by the roadside. It turned out to be Shen Shijun, who came in a hurry upon hearing the news to look for his gloves.
0:10:23|0:10:29|Although wearing a coat and a scarf, the cold wind in Shanghai still made [Gu Manzhen] couldn't help but sneeze several times.
0:10:35|0:10:47|The next morning, [Shen Shijun] sat nervously at the book club with a newspaper in his hand. Sitting directly across from him was [Gu Manzhen], who had called yesterday to say she had lost her gloves.
0:10:55|0:11:1|Shuhui didn't have time to think about why Shen Shijun was sitting in his seat. He picked up the pen on the table and walked out.
0:11:4|0:11:27|[Gu Manzhen] interrupted [Shen Shijun] as he was reaching into his pocket. Just as Manzhen was about to drape a sweater with a missing shoulder over [Shi Jun]'s back, her action was interrupted by someone, so she had to stop.
0:11:30|0:11:36|Unexpectedly, when Manzhen returned, [Shi Jun] was still sitting in the position of the book club.
0:11:46|0:11:49|[Shi Jun] gave Gu Manzhen an awkward smile and then turned around and left.
0:11:52|0:12:0|Shuhui asked the blind colleague to get a glass of water, while Manzhen leaned against the table, smiling as she watched Yujin walk away.
0:12:32|0:12:52|In front of the mirror, a woman with thick lips and blush on her cheeks is adjusting her earrings. Upon closer inspection, there is a slight resemblance between this young lady and Gu Manzhen. Meanwhile, Gu Manzhen is lying sick in bed. It turns out that the young lady is Gu Manzhen's sister, Shi Cuizhi.
0:12:53|0:13:18|She first touched Gu Manzhen's forehead, then gently brushed her cheek. With one hand propped on the edge of the bed, she slowly extinguished the cigarette at the corner of her mouth.
0:13:39|0:13:50|The sister, who was puffing on a cigarette, heard Gu Manzhen's complaint, first swayed to sit up, then propped her chin with her left hand, lightly flicked with her right hand, and flicked the cigarette ash into her palm.
0:13:54|0:13:59|The older sister stood by the desk, smoking, looking at the photo pressed under the glass, and asked.
0:14:55|0:15:3|A few days later, [Gu Manzhen] returned to the restaurant with the unfinished sweater to meet with Shi Jun. She didn't rush to pick up the dishes, but spoke first.
0:16:57|0:17:17|[Gu Manzhen] smiled as she looked at the dishes just served on the table, then she started eating heartily. After a satisfying meal, [Gu Manzhen] walked into the alley leading to her home.
0:17:24|0:17:27|It turns out that the person is [Zhu Hongcai] who came to visit.
0:17:32|0:17:37|Xu Shuhui's hair appeared exceptionally prominent under the strong light on the roof.
0:18:7|0:18:13|Manlu angrily slammed the phone against the wall, then quickly walked downstairs and rushed towards [Zhu Hongcai].
0:18:54|0:18:58|Halfway through, [Gu Manzhen] put down the water cup, touched her face, and rushed to the dressing table.
0:19:10|0:19:14|[Zhu Hongcai] walked slowly up behind [Gu Manzhen], bending at the waist.
0:19:20|0:19:26|At this moment, [Gu Manzhen] yawned, holding a plate, and turned into the corridor from the narrow streets of the small town.
0:19:34|0:19:49|[Gu Manzhen] sat on the edge of the bed holding a plate of snacks, took a bite, and then her mother looked at her disdainfully before continuing to unpack the quilt cover.
0:20:31|0:20:34|Wan Lu stopped chewing, looking despondent.
0:20:47|0:20:50|Outside of a gunshot, [Gu Manlu] slowly opened her eyes on the bed.
0:21:0|0:21:3|Gu Manzhen's brows were furrowed, her chest rising and falling unevenly.
0:21:10|0:21:25|Gu Manzhen tightened her lips and stood up, walking towards the door. However, memories of her past with Zhang Yujin still lingered in her mind. Late at night, Gu Manzhen supported Zhang Yujin as they walked into a dark alley, only to be pushed away the next second.
0:21:29|0:21:33|In the moonlight, [Gu Manzhen], with skin delicate as a blown bubble, had tears in her eyes.
0:21:40|0:21:46|The diseased long hair trembled slightly with the fluctuation of emotions. Finally, she took a deep breath and said.
0:21:48|0:21:55|Looking at Zhang Yujin sitting on the edge of the stage in a sulk, Gu Manzhen held back her tears, turned around without looking back, and left.
0:21:56|0:22:11|[Zhang Yujin] reluctantly took off her glasses, the still wet blood stains dripping down her shaved chin. But when it came to bidding farewell to [Gu Manlu], she couldn't bring herself to say a word. As the memories faded, [Gu Manlu] slowly detached herself from the past.
0:22:12|0:22:31|To the sound of drums, melodious singing floated out from the elegantly decorated private rooms one by one. The boss was already seated in a corner of the sofa, lightly tapping his thigh along with the melody. At this moment, [Zhu Hongcai] opened the door at the corridor.
0:22:34|0:22:41|Just as he entered the private room, the corners of his mouth, which had been slightly raised, suddenly twitched. He pretended not to see the woman in the room and sat on the sofa, swaying his skirt.
0:22:50|0:23:9|Being called out by the boss, Xu Shuhui had to bow and sit back at the table. At that moment, the dancer next to the boss leaned on his shoulder with a smile, while Gu Manzhen stood up. But as soon as the boss saw Gu Manzhen, the smile on his face disappeared.
0:23:24|0:23:31|Gu Manzhen's hand holding the teacup awkwardly hung in the air. It was Xu Shuhui who kept staring at Gu Manzhen.
0:23:46|0:24:6|Seeing [Mr. Wang] completely ignoring her, [Gu Manzhen] stood up and left in a huff. She draped her coat over her shoulders and sat back down heavily next to [Mr. Wang].
0:24:8|0:24:30|Late at night, in a quiet and desolate alley, two yellow cabs slowly turned into the intersection, with dim lights shining on the drivers. In front of an iron gate, the two stopped. [Gu Manzhen] stood by the gate and called out to [Xu Shuhui] who was about to leave.
0:24:37|0:24:43|Shijun stood behind [Gu Manzhen] quietly, watching her.
0:25:1|0:25:21|Shi Baibai came to the iron gate with a smile, took out the key, and slowly unwound the chain. [Gu Manzhen] didn't deliberately look back, her hands that were originally in front of her also gently dropped after Shi Baibai opened the door. But she couldn't help it after all, after walking a few steps, she finally turned back to look behind her.
0:25:33|0:25:48|A few days later, late at night, the wealthy lady complained while watering the flowers in the attic, while [Xu Shuhui] hurriedly ran down the stairs with gloves in hand.
0:26:43|0:26:51|Beside her, Shijun was busy as soon as Gu Manzhen entered the room. Upon hearing Shuhui's mother's instructions, she took her to her own room.
0:26:57|0:27:0|Shijun picked up a cup of hot water from the bedside and walked towards [Gu Manzhen].
0:27:12|0:27:14|The next day, Shijun returned to the station on the train.
0:27:33|0:27:52|[Gu Manzhen] was arranging the snacks she brought, while Shijun leaned in close to her ear, intentionally or unintentionally. This ambiguous scene made [Gu Manzhen] feel at a loss for a moment, so she had to speak up to break the atmosphere.
0:28:6|0:28:24|Manzhen casually put the clothes that Shuhongcai had piled on the bed into the suitcase. Shuhongcai then gently stared at his profile, slowly sitting on the edge of the bed. With the memories of yesterday over, Shuhongcai took the packed luggage and Shuhui separately sat in the yellow cart and headed home.
0:28:24|0:28:27|Walking through the narrow and bustling morning market, the two stopped in front of the house.
0:28:45|0:28:54|[Shi Jun] greeted and hurriedly re-entered the lobby.
0:29:7|0:29:10|In the evening, a large family sat around the table.
0:29:31|0:29:34|[Shi Cuizhi] took a few more glances at Shuhui, who looked somewhat out of place.
0:30:4|0:30:8|After dinner, [Zhu Hongcai] and [Shi Cuizhi] went out together under the arrangement of their mother.
0:30:15|0:30:39|Gu Manzhen and Xu Shuhui sat together in the back of the carriage, accidentally bumping shoulders and both awkwardly shrinking back. Shi Cuizhi held the reins on one side, sitting side by side with the coachman in the front. Passing through an archway, the carriage headed towards a beautiful Western-style house. The carved windows, under the round glass lamps, reflected a warm glow.
0:30:39|0:30:41|Hearing the sound, the butler quickly stepped out.
0:30:54|0:31:34|Shuhui bid farewell to [Shi Cuizhi], but as soon as she entered, she couldn't help teasing Shijun. Shuhui looked up at the exquisite small building in front of her, laughed and sat in the back of the carriage. The next day, the three of them walked side by side in the winter park. Shuhui walked in between the two holding chestnuts, only to have one taken by Shijun the next second.
0:31:34|0:31:40|As they spoke, the two men gradually stood side by side, behind [Shi Cuizhi]. Then, they stopped in front of the wooden boat by the lake.
0:31:50|0:31:55|Swaying unsteadily, [Shi Cuizhi] had just turned around when she hunched down into a ball.
0:32:18|0:32:36|As the only person who did not board the ship, Shijun turned and ran towards the park without saying a word. Shuhui had to help [Shi Cuizhi] into the cabin. The winter park was a bit desolate, and the trees planted by the lake were covered with thick frost in the rainy weather.
0:32:36|0:32:39|On the lake, there were only Xu Shuhui rowing with double oars and Shi Cuizhi sitting opposite her.
0:32:41|0:32:48|Perhaps the long silence made [Shi Cuizhi] feel a bit awkward, so she raised her hand and pointed to a distance.
0:32:55|0:32:58|[Xu Shuhui] smiled and nodded, then lifted both feet.
0:33:4|0:33:9|Seeing [Shi Cuizhi] shyly lowering her head, [Xu Shuhui] quickly rummaged through his pockets.
0:33:10|0:33:29|Gu Manzhen first placed the uneaten chestnuts aside, then lit a cigarette and put it in her mouth. Sitting across from her, Xu Shuhui, with a strong and sturdy figure, took the bag of chestnuts into his hand. Shi Cuizhi intended to pass it over, but was a step too slow, so she awkwardly pulled back her hand holding the cigarette box.
0:33:31|0:33:44|Shi Cuizhi peeled chestnuts while teasingly looking at Xu Shuhui, who kept searching for a lighter in her pockets, but after rummaging through all the pockets, big and small, she still couldn't find it.
0:33:44|0:33:59|[Xu Shuhui] sneakily glanced at [Shi Cuizhi], then put the cigarette back into the box and casually turned his head to look into the distance. [Shi Cuizhi] smiled knowingly, about to continue peeling the shells, when she heard a crisp whistle.
0:34:10|0:34:21|Every two days, [Zhu Hongcai] and [Xu Shuhui] boarded the train to the Reixiang Tower. In the bumpy carriage, [Zhu Hongcai] took out his wallet, pulled out the photo of him and [Gu Manzhen] in the park, and looked at it again and again.
0:34:47|0:34:51|Zhao Hongcai prepared a few small gifts and sent them to Gu Manzhen's home.
0:35:6|0:35:11|Gu Manzhen's mother hurriedly swept the floor.
0:35:37|0:35:54|[Zhu Hongcai] bowed to [Gu Manzhen]'s mother in gratitude, then walked straight to [Gu Manzhen]'s room. The warm night light on the desk drew [Zhu Hongcai] closer involuntarily. He first looked down at the photo frame on the table, then picked up a sketchbook and flipped through it casually.
0:35:54|0:36:6|Turning away from the album, about to walk towards the other side of the bookshelf, but the moonlight outside the window stopped him in his tracks. As he turned around, [Gu Manzhen] entered the room.
0:37:28|0:37:36|Gu Manzhen's two younger brothers stood by the stove with mischievous smiles on their faces, then dug out half a piece of salt and melted it into the soup, stirring it in casually.
0:37:43|0:37:55|Manzhen's mother was completely unaware of the children's mischief, and let [Shen Shijun] drink that bowl of soup. The corners of [Shen Shijun]'s mouth, which were originally raised, began to tremble uncontrollably after taking a big sip.
0:38:1|0:38:10|[Shen Shijun] smiled faintly as he held the bowl, not exposing the children's prank. After dinner, he and Manzhen walked to the bustling street.
0:38:19|0:38:26|Manzhen tightened the scarf around her waist upon hearing this, then couldn't help but burst into laughter, and then glanced at [Shen Shijun].
0:38:35|0:39:3|Soldier Shi stood still, grabbed Gu Manzhen's left hand wrapped in a scarf, raised it to his chest, gently pinched it, and then took a step forward. Manzhen looked back nervously in the direction of her home, and then let the soldier lead her slowly forward. At this moment, the soldier spoke, and the two of them walked leisurely under the moonlight.
0:39:7|0:39:18|Manzhen looked up at [Shen Shijun] and smiled before speaking. Shijun tightly held their intertwined hands and looked deeply into [Gu Manzhen]'s eyes.
0:39:35|0:39:50|In front of the dim courtyard, Gu Manzhen stopped in her tracks, but Shijun didn't let go. As he spoke, Shijun turned around and pulled Gu Manzhen back onto the path they had just walked. Trailing half a step behind, Gu Manzhen spoke softly.
0:40:11|0:40:28|Manzhen looked down at Shijun's wrist, about to turn back towards home, but her left hand was still held tightly in front of her by Shijun. The two stood facing each other, then Shijun let go of her hand and took out two books from his pocket, handing them to [Manzhen].
0:40:29|0:40:48|[Gu Manzhen] smiled as she took over, then quickly ran towards home. Shi Jun didn't think much, but instead followed [Gu Manzhen] closely with reluctance, only turning his gaze back when he entered the door. The faint sorrow suddenly washed over Shi Jun's heart as he could no longer see any figure.
0:40:48|0:40:57|Standing in front of the gate of [Gu Manzhen]'s house courtyard, he looked at his shadow projected on the wall for a few seconds, then turned and walked towards the depths of the alley.
0:40:58|0:41:19|The dim alley was quiet, reflecting the happiness of the two just now, as if it were a dream. Fortunately, the bustling crossroads not far away. Outside the house hung with lanterns, a wealthy family was gathering to listen to the melodious opera. The melody drifted into [Zhu Hongcai]'s ears, once again arousing his joyful mood.
0:41:21|0:41:43|Even on a cold winter night, as the chilling wind blows, [Shen Shijun] couldn't help but stop in his tracks, leaning against the wall, closing his eyes to savor the memories. The dim light cast on his neatly combed hair, and his slightly raised eyebrows added a touch of unusual charm to his gentle demeanor. Suddenly, the sound of a tram came from the end of the alley.
0:41:43|0:41:49|Sitting by the window, [Shen Shijun] turned back to look at the place where he had once lingered, his heart heavy as he lowered his head.
0:41:51|0:41:59|Years have passed, the once handsome young man now wears glasses, a sharp suit paired with a knee-length coat, highlighting his tall figure.
0:42:18|0:42:25|[Gu Manzhen] is led by the servant Ah Bao into a garden villa, and then enters [Gu Manlu]'s bedroom.
0:43:4|0:43:7|A girl who looks about eight years old is skipping rope at the door.
0:43:39|0:43:45|Ma Lu sat up from the bed and carefully put the cheongsam into the bag.
0:44:11|0:44:18|[Zhu Hongcai] angrily walked up the stairs. [Gu Manzhen] was about to go downstairs when she ran into him head-on.
0:44:36|0:44:39|Zhao Hongcai caught a cold and warmly invited Gu Manzhen.
0:45:4|0:45:7|[Zhu Hongcai] lay on the bed with a cigarette in hand.
0:46:15|0:46:28|[Zhu Hongcai] suddenly stood up and pushed [Gu Manlu] onto the bed, then locked the door and left. [Gu Manlu] felt as if all her strength had been drained, staring blankly with wide eyes, propping her head on her arm in disbelief.
0:46:28|0:46:36|In the alley, [Gu Manzhen] carried the clean clothes and walked towards the rooftop, occasionally poking her head out as if she was anticipating something.
0:46:52|0:46:57|Ignoring the teasing from the neighbors, [Gu Manzhen] went to the rooftop to hang up the clothes.
0:47:16|0:47:20|Shijun stood eagerly by [Gu Manzhen]'s side.
0:47:33|0:47:36|Shiyun handed the clothes hanger hanging on the cotton rope to [Gu Manzhen].
0:47:50|0:48:3|Gu Manzhen laughed as she took the clothes hanger from the guard's hand after he accidentally dropped the sock to the ground while trying to hang it up to confirm his words.
0:48:28|0:48:40|[Gu Manzhen] recalled the various scenes of the past when the suitor came to propose. It was still that autumn and winter, when Zhang Yujin turned into the alley of [Gu Manzhen]'s home in the pouring rain. As he looked up, he caught sight of [Gu Manzhen] just entering the door.
0:48:44|0:48:47|Staring at the brilliant and harmonious appearance of [Gu Manzhen], Zhang Yujing stood still in the distance.
0:49:27|0:49:32|Anyway, Manlu has already gotten married, so her room is now empty.
0:49:57|0:50:14|Although Zhang Yujin and [Gu Manzhen]'s mother chatted casually, when [Gu Manlu] was mentioned, she couldn't help but lower her head, tightly gripping the teacup in her hand, lifting the corners of her mouth slightly, almost smiling. The heavy rain outside the window kept falling, as if her emotions were being covered by a thick layer of sand.
0:50:14|0:50:19|Unable to avoid the enthusiasm of Gu Manzhen's mother, Zhang Yujin nervously walked towards Gu Manlu's former room.
0:50:20|0:50:28|Inside the room, there was only a dim table lamp, and a cool breeze blew in from the window, casting light on the neatly made bed.
0:50:44|0:50:55|In the dimly lit room, Zhang Yujin approached the corridor with a book in hand. Gu Manzhen's grandmother, who was sitting in the living room picking beans, gently touched [Gu Manzhen]'s mother.
0:52:20|0:52:42|Seeing the evasive response from Gu Manzhen's family, Shi Jun had no choice but to turn and walk downstairs. Just as he reached the corner on the first floor, a casual glance made his face change drastically. In the open door, Manzhen was being helped by Zhang Yujin to install light bulbs on the ceiling. Seeing this, Shi Jun immediately rushed out the door.
0:52:42|0:52:46|Unaware, Gu Manzhen clapped her hands and stood back on the ground.
0:52:53|0:53:11|Upon hearing this, Manzhen turned around and walked towards the outside of the house. As she spoke, [Zhang Yujin] also walked up to Manzhen. At that moment, [Zhu Hongcai] braved the heavy rain and suddenly walked back into the house.
0:53:57|0:54:11|[Zhu Hongcai] accidentally knocked over the cup on the table, but noticed that Manzhen didn't pick up her handkerchief after spilling water, so he opened his umbrella and bid farewell to the two. However, as he passed by the room in the alley, he couldn't help but take a peek inside.
0:54:29|0:54:33|In the store, Manzhen picked up the gloves and walked towards [Zhang Yujin].
0:54:48|0:54:51|The shop owner picked up a new pair and handed it to [Gu Manzhen].
0:55:55|0:56:0|Manzhen gave a wry smile to [Zhang Yujin], then turned and walked out of the store.
0:56:13|0:56:15|[Gu Manlu] sat on the sofa, smoking, and asked.
0:57:4|0:57:9|[Gu Manlu] threw down the cigarette, stood up angrily, and leaned against the window.
0:57:46|0:57:55|On the other side, [Zhang Yujin], who had just returned from the store, was packing her luggage in the room. Even the book that Manzhen had given her to pass the time was neatly placed in the suitcase.
0:57:58|0:58:7|Without paying attention, a coin fell to the ground. [Zhang Yujin] was about to pick it up when she caught a glimpse of [Gu Manzhen] hurrying in from the doorway.
0:58:33|0:58:48|In the midst of conversation, the two had already stood by the bed where the luggage was placed, and [Gu Manzhen] picked up a book from among them.
0:58:59|0:59:3|Seeing [Gu Manzhen] sitting on the bed with a book in hand, [Zhang Yujin] replied softly.
0:59:19|0:59:38|[Gu Manzhen] heard this and instantly bent down, trembling as she withdrew her hand that was reaching for the coin. Tears silently streamed down in a direction where [Zhang Yujin] couldn't see. [Zhang Yujin] only glanced at her back a few times before turning around to continue packing up the luggage on the bed.
0:59:43|0:59:52|Night fell, [Gu Manzhen] stood on the corridor of the small attic, staring blankly, holding the gloves she bought in the afternoon in her hand.
1:0:21|1:0:30|In a small restaurant, [Xu Shuhui] watched [Gu Manzhen] fiddling with her gloves, asking softly. When it came to the working day, at noon, [Shen Shijun] came to find [Xu Shuhui].
1:0:44|1:1:12|Shuhui teased Shijun by giving him an orange, watching him walk away angrily. When Shijun returned to the workshop, he happened to see Manzhen distributing a box of snacks. At that moment, Manzhen looked up and saw Shijun walking towards her with his hands in his pockets.
1:1:13|1:1:16|Later, the two returned to [Gu Manzhen]'s office.
1:2:5|1:2:12|Gu Manzhen stood anxiously in the corridor, then smiled and hurried down the stairs the next second.
1:2:31|1:2:49|The joy of the reunion was quickly dispelled by the sudden news, but [Gu Manzhen] soon adjusted her mindset, raised the corners of her mouth, and walked back into the alley with [Shi Jun]. [Shi Jun] was carrying a hastily packed suitcase, walking step by step beside him.
1:2:49|1:2:59|Soon, the two of them passed through the iron gate and arrived at the crowded corner. Seeing the worried look on [Shi Cuizhi]'s face, [Gu Manzhen] paused and hesitantly spoke.
1:3:2|1:3:26|The breeze brushed past [Shi Cuizhi]'s thin cheeks, leaving him speechless for a moment. After taking a few steps, [Shi Cuizhi] slowly stopped and turned around, lowering his head to look at [Gu Manzhen].
1:4:5|1:4:9|Shi Jun put away the pen, sequentially grabbed Gu Manzhen's hand and held it in front of his chest.
1:4:18|1:4:23|Shi Jun intended to say something more, but caught sight of a yellow carriage on the side of the road and quickly walked towards it.
1:4:27|1:4:39|Picking up the suitcase again, [Shi Cuizhi] took three steps back and looked back at Gu Manzhen, then turned around resolutely and sat on the yellow carriage, gradually leaving on the bustling and crowded street.
1:4:39|1:4:49|[Gu Manzhen] unconsciously waved her hand and took a few steps forward until she saw the yellow cart disappear at the end of the road. Then she turned desolately and walked towards home.
1:4:50|1:5:10|At this moment, the bustling stalls on both sides of the road seemed completely unrelated to him. In the winter night, only one figure appeared somewhat lonely in the crowd. With the night shrouded in mist, at the other end of the city, a loud rumble echoed as the locomotive, emitting thick smoke, pulled away from the station with a string of carriages.
1:5:10|1:5:13|And as Gu Manzhen said, she seemed to express her feelings with her pen.
1:5:32|1:5:41|On the tangled railway tracks, two trains swiftly pass each other in a mountain tunnel, as a figure full of longing heads towards the factory.
1:5:41|1:5:52|Quietly bypassing the office door, Shijun tiptoed to put down the briefcase in his hand, then came behind [Gu Manzhen], peeked at the apricot branches on his desk, and scared [Gu Manzhen] who was sitting quietly into a loud scream.
1:6:8|1:6:16|Shijun picked up the letter and playfully teased Gu Manzhen by spinning it around. Shijun stood still, grabbed Gu Manzhen's arms, and led her to a small restaurant.
1:6:40|1:7:0|It's strange, but Dad's illness suddenly took a turn for the better. The two sat at the dining table, silent. [Gu Manzhen] was stunned by this sudden news, opened her mouth several times, but didn't say anything. When Shijun decided to stay in Nanjing.
1:7:13|1:7:25|And I also promised to go back to Nanjing with him to meet his parents. On a sunny morning, [Gu Manzhen] accompanied Jun and Shuhui to Nanjing.
1:7:26|1:7:31|Ah, [Gu Manzhen] complains while packing her luggage.
1:8:28|1:8:33|Wearing an oiled hair and sporting a moustache, the man hurriedly took [Shi Cuizhi] in his arms and said.
1:8:51|1:8:55|Shi Cuizhi looked back and forth between Xu Shuhui and Gu Manzhen.
1:9:8|1:9:21|Xu Shuhui and Yi Peng greeted Gu Hongcai to continue climbing towards the artificial hill. Gu Hongcai smiled slightly, turned around and quickly walked back to Gu Manzhen's side. Shi Cuizhi's friend, on the other hand, stayed at the back of the line with her.
1:10:3|1:10:21|On the long street leading to the pavilion, Wan Zhen smiled mischievously, then took [Zhu Hongcai]'s hand and continued walking towards the mountain. Not far from them, Shuhui and [Shi Cuizhi] were sitting next to her brother's rockery. After tidying up, Shuhui gestured to the two of them to move on.
1:10:22|1:10:44|Seeing [Shi Cuizhi] slightly tired, bending over, Xu Shuhui gentlemanly lowered his right hand and led her up the long stone steps. [Shi Cuizhi] hesitated for a moment, then smiled and followed his pace. There weren't many people in the park in the afternoon, the warm sun shining on the two of them, dispelling a hint of goodwill.
1:10:44|1:10:47|On the other side, [Shen Shijun] pulled Manzhen to the high platform.
1:12:8|1:12:28|Yi Peng embraced [Shi Cuizhi]'s friend Wenxian, and they walked out of the gate of the Shijun family together. Shuhui didn't say anything, just looked back at the two in the late night. It wasn't until they disappeared into the courtyard that Shuhui turned and walked towards the attic. When she reached the second floor, she stopped in her tracks, intending to rush downstairs but ultimately held back.
1:12:28|1:12:34|Facing the window, a hint of moonlight suddenly flashed across Xu Shuhui's face, upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a tear.
1:12:45|1:12:55|In the deep of the building across the way, [Shen Shijun]'s mother pushed the door open and greeted Shuhui, who had her back to her, with a smile, inviting her to come in with her and then bringing out a cup of tea.
1:13:30|1:13:36|Gu Manzhen happened to be carrying a teapot as she walked up from the first floor, and coincidentally overheard the gossip about herself.
1:13:45|1:13:49|In the room, without saying a word, [Gu Manzhen] took off the suit and draped it over Manzhen's shoulders.
1:13:52|1:14:1|Then, [Shen Shijun] took off the scarf from his body and carefully wrapped it around [Gu Manzhen]'s neck, then firmly pressed her shoulders from behind.
1:14:9|1:14:19|[Gu Manzhen] turned around and saw [Shen Shijun] kneeling on one knee, presenting a gemstone ring. [Gu Manzhen] carefully held it between her fingertips.
1:15:11|1:15:19|[Gu Manzhen] walked into the living room with a water kettle. Seeing [Gu Manzhen] awake, [Gu Manzhen]'s grandmother took care of [Shen Shijun] and asked him to sit in the room.
1:15:24|1:15:34|Before long, [Gu Manzhen] returned to the room. [Shen Shijun] stood by the small balcony, rubbing his coat.
1:15:36|1:15:40|Gu Manzhen sat in front of Shen Shijun, facing the chair in front of the desk where Nong Kai was sitting.
1:15:49|1:15:58|[Gu Manzhen] adjusted her hair in front of the mirror. [Shen Shijun] stood with his hands in his pockets, leaning against the door frame.
1:16:2|1:16:8|[Gu Manzhen] lightly rubbed her fingers and then looked up at [Shen Shijun]. [Shen Shijun] turned his head.
1:16:15|1:16:18|[Shen Shijun] strode into the room and sat on the bed.
1:16:35|1:16:39|[Gu Manzhen] stood up with a smile and walked slowly to the bookshelf.
1:16:46|1:16:48|Shen Shijun came to sit down behind Gu Manzhen.
1:17:4|1:17:10|Bent over, [Zhu Hongcai] rested his hands on his knees, rubbing them together quietly in response to [Zhang Yujin].
1:17:33|1:17:36|Before [Gu Manzhen] could finish speaking, [Shen Shijun] had already left the spot.
1:17:58|1:18:18|[Gu Manzhen] finally managed to dig out the glove from the box, but then she put it back heavily. She sat back on the edge of the bed, took off the ring from her left hand, and handed it to [Shen Shijun] beside her. Perhaps holding her breath, the left hand that [Gu Manzhen] handed out fluctuated with her breathing.
1:18:18|1:18:26|Shen Shijun, who was two punches away from him, was also incredulous for a moment, gripping the edge of the bed tightly with both hands, then turning his head in astonishment to look at Manzhen.
1:18:27|1:18:41|Taking a deep breath, [Shen Shijun] slowly raised his hand, took the ring handed by Manzhen, and held it tightly with both hands, bowing his head. The next moment, he placed the ring back on the bed, picked up his coat, and without looking back, left the room. On the other side, at Manlu's home.
1:18:57|1:19:0|Gu Manzhen and her mother were led to Manlu's bedside by the servant.
1:20:17|1:20:19|Not only was Mom and Manlu talking, Manzhen gritted her teeth and stood up angrily, rushing out of the room. After a while, Manzhen's mother came out, just turned the corner and saw Manzhen sitting at the door.
1:21:11|1:21:30|Seeing Gu Manzhen nod slightly, Gu Manzhen's mother hugged her body, supported her waist with one hand, sighed and walked out of the door. Gu Manzhen stood up, tightened the hands that were unconsciously pushed away, and then walked towards the window. Although the weather had not turned warm yet, the view of the small garden outside the window was well taken care of.
1:21:31|1:21:42|The two sisters who had quarreled remained at an impasse until nightfall. Gu Manzhen was sitting on the small sofa smoking, when she heard the sound of a car stopping outside the window.
1:21:44|1:21:48|He stood up abruptly and leaned against the window, staring fixedly at the people outside.
1:21:53|1:22:7|Through the smoke, it seemed as if his originally scattered gaze gradually turned fierce. Before long, [Zhu Hongcai] staggered in with his hat askew, leaning against the wall. He then patted the birdcage.
1:22:13|1:22:24|He rudely tore open the door of the birdcage, and the parrot, named Jianzi, hopped onto the fence, flapped its wings, bumped into his hand, and then fell to the bottom of the cage. It then quickly darted out of the birdcage and escaped.
1:22:26|1:22:46|At this moment, [Gu Manlu] approached [Zhu Hongcai], glanced at the room where [Gu Manzhen] was, her face frowned, and there was a cold gleam in her eyes. [Zhu Hongcai], as if receiving some instructions, excitedly rushed towards [Gu Manzhen]'s room like a raging river, twisting his body and grabbing the handrail of the stairs.
1:22:46|1:23:7|[Gu Manzhen], who was originally sound asleep, suddenly woke up at this moment. The moonlight dimmed, and in her struggle with [Zhu Hongcai], she accidentally shattered the glass by the window. Clearly not as strong as a man, the next moment, [Gu Manzhen] found her hands being held and someone mounting her from behind. Wearing a long nightgown, she made it even easier for the person behind her to be rough and forceful.
1:23:7|1:23:18|Downstairs, the parrots fluttered their wings in panic, flying around the enclosed circular staircase like headless flies. [Gu Manlu] remained indifferent, only lifting her head to look towards [Gu Manzhen]'s room.
1:23:20|1:23:28|Before long, the sounds of the scuffle upstairs gradually faded away, and [Gu Manzhen] spent the cold night like this, finally welcoming the arrival of the second day.
1:24:13|1:24:18|[Gu Manzhen] instantly smiled, coming to the dressing table and using a tissue to wipe the wound.
1:24:26|1:24:32|After hearing these words, [Zhu Hongcai] wrapped his robe tightly and squatted beside [Gu Manlu]. With one hand resting on [Gu Manlu]'s knee, he ate the porridge she handed him in big bites. On the other side, [Gu Manzhen] curled up into a ball, absentmindedly hugging herself.
1:25:33|1:25:35|Manlu takes the broken glass from [Gu Manzhen]'s hand.
1:25:53|1:26:8|Gu Manzhen suddenly waved her hand, pushing Gu Manlu and Shen Shijun towards the tea table behind. Hearing the commotion, the maid quickly entered the room.
1:26:17|1:26:36|Manzhen was speechless for a moment, and when she saw the door open, she immediately rushed towards it, but the next second she was knocked down by [Gu Manlu]. [Gu Manlu] pointed fiercely at Manzhen, then turned and walked out of the room with the maid. Manzhen scrambled to the door.
1:26:53|1:27:14|On the other side, [Zhu Hongcai], who parted ways with Gu Manzhen, returned to Nanjing. Sitting by the bed, he watched his seriously ill father leaning against his mother, lost in thought. Then he saw his father struggling, using his remaining consciousness to gesture with his hands, as if explaining something. In the blink of an eye, the night sky was filled with scattered snowflakes drifting down.
1:27:30|1:27:45|Beside the desk, [Zhu Hongcai] slowly capped the pen and looked at the snowflakes flying outside the window, his thoughts drifting far away. In the Western-style house at this moment, Manzhen sat helplessly at the head of the bed, unconsciously fiddling with the ring on her right ring finger.
1:27:45|1:27:56|The broken window that was smashed earlier has been securely nailed shut. Outside the window, the warm sun shines, but it cannot brighten Manzhen's gloomy heart. At this moment, the maid approaches with a tray of food.
1:28:26|1:28:47|Gu Manzhen forcefully stuffed the ring in the maid's hand, then pushed it out of the room. The maid, holding the ring, had just walked a few steps downstairs when she caught sight of the door left ajar, so she turned around, smiled, and quickly walked back into the room.
1:28:57|1:29:10|Shi Jun's family pushed their father in a wheelchair onto the street. Fu Xia tightened the blanket on his father. Shi Jun arrived at the telephone booth outside Manzhen's house.
1:29:15|1:29:39|Everyone carried their luggage and said goodbye in the alley. Upstairs, the phone kept ringing, Manzhen's mother was about to go up to answer it, but was interrupted the next second. The door closed completely, and Manzhen's family moved away from the original place like this.
1:29:40|1:29:59|The neglected alleyway was covered with moss, and in the dim and damp environment, the paint on the wooden house's exterior had long peeled off. The only place in the square courtyard that received any light was the small path under the empty well. Walking into the house, the first thing that caught the eye was the cluttered and broken wooden shelves and a few wooden basins that had not been cleaned up.
1:29:59|1:30:6|In the alley outside the house, [Shi Jun] paced back and forth with his hands in front of him, and the next second, an old man approached.
1:30:19|1:30:37|After the old man finished speaking, he slowly walked out of the alley with the vegetables in hand. [Shi Jun] who had been waiting anxiously beside him, also put his hands back into his coat pockets, then leaned back against the wall, looking up at the place he had visited many times before. On the other side, [Zhu Hongcai] walked into the house with a bowl in hand.
1:30:40|1:31:2|Placing the box in his hand on the ground, he smiled and handed the bowl to [Gu Manzhen] sitting by the window. However, [Gu Manzhen] just sat in the recliner, looking out the window, ignoring his words. Mr. Zhu pursed his lips at this, turned around, gently placed the bowl on the bedside table, and spoke carefully.
1:31:6|1:31:13|Then he slowly took a few steps back, only to move his gaze back and walk out of the room when he reached the door.
1:31:39|1:31:58|Shen Shijun sat on the sofa and greeted. Shen Shijun took out a handkerchief, handed something to [Shi Cuizhi], and slowly lit a cigarette from the table.
1:32:24|1:32:38|[Gu Manlu] lowered her head, so that Shijun couldn't detect her evasive gaze. Upstairs, [Gu Manzhen] slowly opened the box that had just been closed. Among the stacked luggage and coats, the pair of gloves that had not been given away stood out conspicuously.
1:32:38|1:32:49|She first gently touched it, then carefully held it in her hand. Her breathing, which had been calm, suddenly became rapid, her knees weakened, and she fell back, sitting on the edge of the bed.
1:32:50|1:33:11|And what he didn't know was that, in just a few short seconds, [Shi Jun] had already put on his coat, bid farewell to [Manlu], and walked into the small garden. If [Gu Manzhen] had looked out the window at this moment, even just a vague figure, she would have recognized that it was her long-awaited lover, her only hope.
1:33:11|1:33:31|Fate played a joke on this couple. While [Gu Manzhen] was grieving in secret, [Shi Cuizhi] walked out of the garden completely, leaving this place of sorrow. On a cold and damp morning, a small boat cut through the thick fog, moving forward. The boatman at the bow vigorously pushed the bamboo pole to navigate the direction.
1:33:31|1:33:43|A coffin covered with cotton cloth stood in the middle of the cabin, the cold wind blowing from the river causing its tail to sway uncontrollably. [Shi Cuizhi]'s mother had to firmly hold onto the sides with the help of the servants.
1:33:44|1:34:4|[Gu Manzhen] stood silently by the side of the boat, staring straight at the rolling river, then suddenly raised the handkerchief she had been holding tightly to her chest. After a moment of contemplation, she slowly pulled out the ring from it, lowered her head to examine it closely, and then, as if mustering up courage, glanced at the river so close at hand.
1:34:4|1:34:28|Without any hesitation, [Shi Cuizhi] threw the ring down. In the blink of an eye, the once token of love disappeared without a trace. Although [Xu Shuhui] appeared calm on the surface, his trembling throat exposed his true feelings. Finally, he returned to his family without any attachment, using one hand to support the coffin as it slowly drifted down the river.
1:34:29|1:34:48|By the river, layers of withered reed leaves swayed freely in the wind and frost. A gust of cold wind blew in, tearing the thick fog into many pieces, but as a small boat passed by, they gathered back together. As time passed, a man with a face full of wrinkles turned into an alley.
1:35:8|1:35:15|The man who entered the cabin is the husband of [Jin Fang].
1:36:2|1:36:27|Gu Manzhen finally gave birth to a child. Dressed in a sharp suit, Shi Jun stood in the luxurious Golden Beauty Hotel, taking photos with the newlyweds. When he turned around, he noticed the heartbroken figure.
1:36:48|1:36:57|With his back to the crowd, Shijun handed a handkerchief to the sobbing [Shi Cuizhi], while Manzhen took out a piece of paper in the dimly lit room and wrote down the name Shijun stroke by stroke.
1:37:13|1:37:18|Before long, the letter carrying [Gu Manzhen]'s inner thoughts drifted to [Shen Shijun]'s home.
1:37:26|1:37:31|[Shen Shijun]'s mother picked up the letter spread out on the table, glanced at it, and then threw it back down.
1:37:34|1:37:53|[Xu Shuhui] nodded in agreement, then picked up the letter and envelope, turned around, and threw them into the fireplace at her feet. Filled with endless longing, her thoughts vanished along with the ashes after the final flicker of light. Soon, the joyful days for [Shen Shijun] and [Shi Cuizhi] arrived.
1:38:46|1:38:57|[Zhu Hongcai] forced a smile, put down the satisfied wine glass, grabbed [Shi Cuizhi]'s hand, and firmly placed it on [Shen Shijun]'s hand. [Shi Cuizhi] looked at him in surprise, but eventually avoided his gaze and lowered her head.
1:38:59|1:39:19|At the banquet, [Zhang Yujin] changed out of her half male attire and walked in the cold rainy night. The cigarette burning at her fingertips became the only source of light on the street. The alcohol she had consumed now soaked her whole body, causing her legs to move forward mechanically. She staggered to avoid the oncoming carriage, which helped her to regain some clarity.
1:39:19|1:39:26|She flicked the ash away, gathered up the stray hair hanging in front of her, and with a glance, transformed back into the elegant young man.
1:39:30|1:39:46|At the same time, [Gu Manzhen], after taking care of herself, walked into the alley of [Xu Shuhui]'s house with a scarf around her neck and a bag of pastries. As she approached her destination, looking at the warm light on the steps, she suddenly stopped, took a deep breath, and then continued walking forward.
1:40:14|1:40:18|Returning to [Gu Manzhen], she stopped her needlework and asked softly.
1:41:12|1:41:26|Shuhui's parents realized their mistake and saw Gu Manzhen holding back her emotions, so they quickly called her to eat vegetables. Gu Manzhen then said goodbye and went into the cinema alone. On the screen, the exaggerated actions of the men and women in the movie set the tone for the whole audience.
1:41:26|1:41:37|[Gu Manlu] stared ahead without blinking, with mist swirling in her eyes, gradually unable to see the scene in front of her clearly. But the next second, she suddenly curled up her lips, tears like beads off a broken string sliding down her face.
1:41:38|1:41:55|Organizing her emotions, [Gu Manzhen] walked briskly to the alley where she used to live. The once tidy lane had now been demolished, leaving it impassable. Bricks and debris were scattered haphazardly along the road, now serving as a gathering spot for people to chat and warm themselves by the fire.
1:41:55|1:41:59|Pushing through the crowd, [Gu Manzhen] caught a glimpse of a sharply dressed man and hurried to catch up with him.
1:42:32|1:42:39|The moment of joy was blown away, [Gu Manzhen] walked out of the alley with her head down in the sudden snowstorm.
1:43:21|1:43:44|Autumn has come and gone, another year has passed. Now, [Gu Manzhen] has become a teacher. Gone is her previous desolate appearance, although dressed very simply, when she teaches, she radiates a sense of glory. Back in her simple dormitory, she is boiling water. As she was using tongs to stoke the fire, she stopped when she saw someone approaching.
1:43:50|1:44:6|[Gu Manlu] walked slowly with the support of two maids. Although it was winter, she was wearing much thicker clothes than adults, and after brushing past [Gu Manzhen], she leaned against the head of the bed with the help of the maids, as if she had shed tears.
1:44:9|1:44:14|During this time, [Gu Manzhen] was busy tending to the stove.
1:44:28|1:44:37|Gu Manzhen turned around, walked to the table, took out a cup and poured a glass of water, then she took out a photo.
1:44:58|1:45:14|Manzhen didn't look at the photo handed over by [Gu Manlu]. After pouring another glass of water, she sat down next to [Gu Manlu] with two cups in hand. [Gu Manlu] glanced at the photo, took the water handed to her the next second, and then watched Manzhen take the photo away and lower her head to look at it.
1:45:42|1:45:47|Holding the photo in her hand again, [Gu Manzhen] took a sip of water and couldn't help but start coughing.
1:45:48|1:46:14|Manzhen immediately stood up when she saw this, took the water glass, then took the towel and squatted in front of [Gu Manlu], patting her back and wiping the water on her chest. [Gu Manlu] pulled a bracelet from her wrist and sat up against Manzhen with difficulty. Seeing her determination, Manzhen's attitude also softened.
1:46:15|1:46:26|Following the address provided by [Gu Manzhen], Manzhen took a pedicab and turned into a narrow alley. The old servant was already waiting at the door.
1:46:42|1:46:46|The old servant led [Gu Manzhen] to an open room on the second floor.
1:46:52|1:47:5|[Gu Manzhen] saw [Shi Cuizhi] doing homework at the table. Following [Shi Cuizhi]'s gesture, she walked towards the back of the room, where a bed occupied one-third of the room, and a little boy with his face wrapped in a blanket.
1:47:27|1:47:40|The old servant placed the medicine by the bedside and left the room. Although it was the first time meeting Gu Manzhen, Rong Bao couldn't help but move his little hand out of the blanket and reached towards Gu Manzhen. Before long, Zhu Hongcai returned with the dishes.
1:47:42|1:48:9|Placing the basket on the wooden table by the door, she turned around and stood still. [Gu Manzhen] was just wringing a towel in the basin, then walked to Rongbao's bedside. She wiped the table without paying much attention. Zhu [Zhu Hongcai] was fiddling with the water glass, so he had to quickly come to Rongbao's side.
1:48:12|1:48:28|Glancing at the uncomfortable Rong Bao, Mr. Zhu awkwardly spoke up. Gu Manzhen, however, paid no attention and went to the table with Manlu's photos to continue tidying up. Mr. Zhu had no choice but to leave the room and stood in the corridor, holding out a bowl and chopsticks to try to keep her.
1:48:37|1:48:51|Before the fire, Emperor Zhao picked up the bowl and swallowed it in big gulps. Manzhen sat calmly on the side, glanced at him, and whispered to Shu [Shu Hongcai] next to her. Then she used chopsticks to pick up a piece of meat from the plate and put it in Emperor Zhao's bowl.
1:48:51|1:49:0|Zhu Hongcai, who has been paying attention to Gu Manzhen, slowly puts down the chopsticks in his hand, picks up a spoon from the table, and scoops a spoonful of meat into Gu Manzhen's bowl.
1:49:3|1:49:20|Seeing the indifferent look on [Zhu Hongcai], Manzhen hesitated for a moment, then continued to eat slowly. After the meal, [Zhu Hongcai] was the first to find a corner on the recliner and fell asleep, while Manzhen lay beside Rongbao, staring blankly at his sleeping face.
1:49:20|1:49:27|It was unbearable. Zhu [Zhu Hongcai], wrapped in a coat, shivered as he got up and changed into another jacket to put on.
1:49:30|1:49:45|But the commotion quickly woke up the already sick [Shen Shijun]. Manzhen quickly picked up the towel next to the pillow and gently wiped his forehead. Hearing the commotion, Xu Shuhui carefully lit a candle and hurried to the two of them. Xu Shuhui breathed a sigh of relief, bent down and placed the candle on the bedside table.
1:50:10|1:50:21|The cold wind blew in through the window cracks, in the flickering light, Gu Manzhen's sparse hair, like dry grass, was particularly prominent, but she just turned her head after listening, lost in her thoughts.
1:50:23|1:50:27|The next morning, the sunlight streamed through the window onto the bed.
1:50:33|1:50:45|The next moment, she found the sofa in the distance was gone, so she immediately turned around and got out of bed. As she sat on the edge of the bed putting on her shoes, she glanced up and noticed something unusual at that moment.
1:50:46|1:51:8|With narrowed eyes, [Gu Manzhen] glanced out the window, then stood up with her hands on the edge of the bed and slowly walked towards the nearby dining table. On the shining table, there were stacked fried dough sticks and fried doughnuts in the plates, and a bowl of soy milk was placed next to them. To keep it warm, a plate was even placed upside down on top at night.
1:51:30|1:51:39|Without refusing this kind gesture, [Gu Manzhen] picked up the fried dough sticks and soy milk and started eating. In the blink of an eye, many years had passed, and a ship was docked by the busy wharf.
1:51:51|1:52:4|[Xu Shuhui] was wearing a leather jacket, chewing gum, carrying a suitcase, and walked out of the crowded ship onto a small path. She stopped at the staircase, looked down, as if searching for someone.
1:52:30|1:52:47|[Shi Cuizhi] sent her daughter and youngest son to [Xu Shuhui]'s parents, and then the five of them anxiously waited at the pier. In the crowded passage, [Xu Shuhui]'s parents saw the neatly dressed Shuhui from a distance at a glance.
1:53:9|1:53:25|Bowing his head to see Da Bao and Er Bao holding balloons, [Zhu Hongcai] smiled and handed the luggage to Shi Jun, then picked up the two children, each taking one. Then, under the pull of their mother, they left the crowded crowd laughing and walked briskly towards the dock.
1:53:25|1:53:34|Behind the mother and son not far away, [Zhu Hongcai]'s father and Shi Jun each held one of the bouncing twins, while [Shi Cuizhi] walked alone beside the eldest child.
1:53:36|1:53:52|After some time, in the study, Xu Shuhui was rummaging through the boxes and cabinets. The precious ebony desk was covered with various books in a mess. The desk lamp was dimly lit, and the wedding photo of Gu Manzhen and Shi Cuizhi was hanging high on the wall facing the door.
1:53:52|1:54:3|Just as [Shen Shijun] was rummaging through the drawer, [Shi Cuizhi] led him in moving the plants in the attic. Suddenly, an envelope fell from the bottom of a thick book.
1:54:4|1:54:10|[Shen Shijun] bent down to pick it up and casually placed it on the desk.
1:54:21|1:54:25|[Shi Cuizhi] then turned around, walked into the bedroom, and took out a coat.
1:54:35|1:54:43|[Shi Cuizhi] rolled her eyes and then turned back to the bedroom. [Shen Shijun] had to pocket the envelope and went downstairs.
1:55:4|1:55:24|Outside the two-story small western-style building, Da Bao and Er Bao are playing with the dog. Watching the dog wag its tail happily under his feeding, Da Bao looks up and pleads, looking at [Shi Cuizhi] standing on the second-floor balcony.
1:55:24|1:55:30|And once [Shen Shijun] boarded the tram after leaving, he finally had the time to take out the letter from his coat pocket and read it carefully.
1:56:11|1:56:25|The long-lost letter turned out to be from [Gu Manzhen]. After many years, seeing the familiar handwriting again, [Shen Shijun] was momentarily stunned. Unconsciously, he found himself dragging his heavy steps to the bookstore near his home.
1:56:26|1:56:35|The moonlight filtered through the sparse leaves, casting dappled patterns on the stone wall. [Shen Shijun] slowly slipped into the alley, his gaze following the lush rocks towards the garden on the second floor of the Shuhui Residence.
1:56:37|1:56:55|He then walked through the gatehouse and headed towards the stairs, but to his surprise, he saw [Gu Manzhen] coming down. At that moment, [Gu Manzhen] appeared to [Shen Shijun] as if the only difference from her youth was the curly ends of her hair at the nape of her neck, adding a touch of charm.
1:56:55|1:57:1|[Gu Manzhen] casually clenched her hands and walked up to [Shen Shijun] with a smile on her face.
1:57:28|1:57:47|The waiter greeted [Shen Shijun] warmly when he entered, leading them deeper into the restaurant. Away from the noisy main hall, the two entered a relatively quiet private room. Shijun followed behind [Gu Manzhen], smiling as he thanked the waiter, then took off his coat.
1:57:49|1:58:6|Then he walked around to his back and hung the clothes on the corner hanger. Next, Shijun took off his hat and scarf, gently placing them on top. [Gu Manzhen] stood by silently watching everything. The next moment, Shijun slowly turned around and walked towards him.
1:58:6|1:58:17|At this moment, [Gu Manzhen] could no longer suppress her emotions, she buried her head into Shijun's shoulder and tightly wrapped her arms around him. Shijun also embraced [Gu Manzhen] in return.
1:58:19|1:58:34|[Gu Manzhen] took a step back, raising her hand to touch Shi Jun's face. Shi Jun held [Gu Manzhen]'s hand to his chest as if holding a treasure. A long scar on [Gu Manzhen]'s wrist caught Shi Jun's attention.
1:58:43|1:58:52|Gu Manzhen was about to continue speaking when she was interrupted by an incoming phone call. In that instant, it seemed like she lost the desire to continue, as she turned around and pulled out a chair to sit at the table.
1:59:4|1:59:8|[Xu Shuhui] raised his glass, while [Shi Cuizhi] took a sip beside him.
1:59:34|1:59:42|[Xu Shuhui] glanced at [Shi Cuizhi] beside him, said nothing, just shook the ice in his glass, then [Shi Cuizhi] poured him another drink.
1:59:52|2:0:10|In the midst of conversation, [Xu Shuhui] raised the corners of his mouth, suddenly leaned in close to [Shi Cuizhi]'s forehead, then lifted his wine glass with a smile and stood up slowly, walking towards the window.
2:0:30|2:0:35|[Xu Shuhui] unconsciously turned around and leaned against the edge of [Shi Cuizhi]'s sofa.
2:0:38|2:0:48|Looking up and glancing to the side, [Shi Cuizhi] had a smile on her face as she leaned back against the sofa. [Xu Shuhui] took a deep breath and leaned in close to her.
2:0:50|2:0:53|With just a fist's distance between them, their foreheads were about to touch.
2:1:0|2:1:15|Shuhui took a deep breath, propped herself up on the armrest of the sofa, stood up, and then sat back in her original position. Meanwhile, Cuizhi raised her glass again. In the restaurant across the way, Hongcai struck a match, lit a cigarette, and took a deep drag.
2:2:1|2:2:14|The food on the table had long gone cold, and [Shi Cuizhi], who knew the truth, remained silent, puffing on her cigarette. As she spoke, the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs from the entrance could be heard.
2:2:28|2:2:37|The once small restaurant has now expanded its storefront, and the two silent figures seem to see some blooming flowers.
2:2:49|2:2:54|[Shen Shijun] adjusted his glasses and looked up at [Gu Manzhen] deeply.
2:3:13|2:3:24|[Gu Manzhen] heard these words, just staring blankly ahead, her thoughts seemingly drifting towards beautiful promises. At this moment, [Shen Shijun] reached for her hand under the table.
2:3:37|2:3:52|[Gu Manzhen] took a deep breath and pulled her hand back from [Zhu Hongcai], as if this action had taken all her courage. She no longer had the strength to even turn her head to look at [Zhu Hongcai], only able to slowly calm herself by breathing slowly and steadily.
2:3:54|2:4:11|Watching the disappearing touch in her hand, [Shi Cuizhi] subconsciously rubbed it a bit, then clasped her hands on the edge of the table and slowly lowered her head. In this way, the two of them maintained their respective actions, not knowing how long they had stayed like this, the lively moment outside the room forming a sharp contrast with them.
2:4:11|2:4:18|The reunion after many years should have been endless joy, but now there is an inexplicable sense of heartache.
2:4:18|2:4:40|After a long silence, [Zhu Hongcai] suddenly remembered his past self, recalling the first time he took a photo with [Gu Manzhen]. The brief encounter during the day left a deep impression on him, to the point that when he heard that [Gu Manzhen] had lost her glove, he braved the severe cold, holding a flashlight, searching all over the park.
2:4:40|2:4:48|Crossing the Yangcheng alley and passing through the bushes, [Shen Shijun] finally found the lonely glove in a corner of the pavilion.
