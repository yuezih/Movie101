0:3:6|0:3:20|[Wan Xing] hadn't reacted yet when she was pushed forward by [Shifen], and [Shimiao] ran up the escalator and bumped into the lone figure of [Wan Xing]. At that moment, [Shimiao]'s best friend [Miao Miaomiao] was standing at the bookstore entrance flipping through a magazine.
0:3:46|0:3:53|[Miao Miaomiao] smiled and took out a hundred yuan bill to hand to the shop assistant, [Shimiao] looked at [Miao Miaomiao] gratefully, and blew her a kiss from a distance.
0:4:23|0:4:41|[Shifen] took out a small turtle. [Shimiao] looked at the cute turtle, her expression suddenly changing from cloudy to sunny. She released the hand on [Shifen] and carefully brought the small turtle in front of her. [Shimiao] touched the small turtle.
0:4:44|0:4:54|The scene shifts to the roadside, where a vendor is selling turtles for only 5 yuan. [Shimiao] realizes she has been deceived. Her thoughts return to reality.
0:5:0|0:5:8|[Miao Miaomiao] immediately widened her eyes, looking at [Shimiao] with a face full of surprise and anticipation, as if there were stars twinkling in her eyes, followed by the appearance of the movie title.
0:5:8|0:5:24|With the sound of the bell signaling the start of class, [Zhen Kaixin] appeared outside the classroom carrying a stack of books. She struggled to walk into the classroom surrounded by a group of girls, sat down next to [Shifen], and [Wan Xing] next to them tugged at the dinosaur toy on [Shifen]'s body. [Zhen Kaixin] took out a stack of comic books and said.
0:5:29|0:5:36|[Zhen Kaixin] looked at the empty bench, [Shifen] turned around and gave a shy smile.
0:5:54|0:6:0|[Shimiao] picked up her phone, turned off the alarm, only to find her hair tied with colorful ribbons to the bedpost.
0:6:1|0:6:5|She picked up the mirror and found her head full of small braids.
0:6:7|0:6:27|After washing her hair, she opened the cabinet and took out a relatively clean towel. Then, as she dried her hair, she pushed open the door to the balcony. Walking to the mirror, she adjusted the stray hair on her forehead and casually picked up the hairdryer on the table. As soon as she turned it on, she was sprayed in the face with flour, causing her to cough uncontrollably. The scene shifted, and when she opened the refrigerator, she found it empty.
0:6:27|0:6:33|A sticky note reads: "Losing weight requires support, don't thank me too much."
0:6:39|0:6:54|Shimiao helplessly closed the bedroom door and hurried to the door. When she opened the door, she saw the schoolbag that her brother Shifen had forgotten. She made up her mind, closed the door and left. After a few steps, she felt guilty and turned back.
0:6:54|0:7:2|She angrily picked up Shifen's backpack, slammed the door and left. Shimiao ran down the stairs one after another, pushing aside the clothes and blankets hanging on the roadside.
0:7:2|0:7:14|Passing by the uncles and aunts exercising downstairs, she arrived at the bottom of a long staircase and struggled to run up. At the top of the stairs was the road, where [Shimiao] finally reached.
0:7:22|0:7:37|[Shifen] was leaning on the table playing with a puzzle, [Wan Sui] handed her the phone, and [Shifen] took it with a mischievous smile. On the bus, [Shimiao] was squeezed against the window when she suddenly received a message from [Shifen], who said, "My dear sister, where is my bag?"
0:7:37|0:7:45|Shimiao finished reading the message and couldn't help but roll her eyes. Running the last stretch like a sprinter, she dashed towards the school gate as she was about to be late.
0:7:48|0:7:56|Shifen sent another message saying, "Dear sister, brother's bag is not important at all, just make sure you're not late, love you." Shimiao angrily put down her phone and ran forward, panting heavily.
0:8:10|0:8:26|She parked the car in the middle of the closing gate and waved to [Shimiao]. [Shimiao] put his arm around [Miao Miaomiao] and stood on the back seat of the electric bike. They drove into the campus like this, passing through the lush tree-lined path, with sunlight shining through the leaves. They were laughing happily.
0:8:26|0:8:33|Shimiao excitedly raised her hand above her head, and Shifen sent a message: "The bell for preparation is ringing, quickly bring the bag to Brother."
0:8:55|0:9:11|Shimiao stood still in disbelief upon hearing Miao Miaomiao's words, feeling deflated. Shimiao turned her head in confusion. The teacher threw the phone on the table.
0:9:30|0:9:38|After reaching an agreement, [Shimiao] decided to help [Shifen] cover up the lie. While the teacher was checking the phone, [Shifen] turned to [Shimiao] and made faces.
0:9:39|0:9:41|Expressing disapproval of her risky behavior at this moment.
0:9:47|0:9:56|The plan was successful, the two of them exchanged a knowing smile, and then the teacher picked up their contact books to compare. Nothing unusual was found.
0:10:17|0:10:26|[Shifen] was momentarily speechless, as [Shimiao] stared in disbelief before speaking.
0:11:11|0:11:30|[Wan Sui] held a test paper with a score of 99, smirked in a pretentious manner, looked satisfied at the paper. On the side, [Zhen Kaixin] held a test paper with a score of 90, eyes shining brightly, laughing like a fool. [Shimiao] walked out of the office with red eyes, crying, and turned the corner expressionless.
0:12:13|0:12:18|On the way home from school, [Shimiao] handed three grilled sausages to [Shifen], who took them and took a bite of each one.
0:12:28|0:12:44|[Shifen] pouted and furrowed her brows, looking at [Shimiao] with a pitiful expression. [Shimiao] deliberately looked away, but then hesitated for a moment and said, nodding, [Shifen] opened her mouth wide as [Shimiao] handed her the grilled sausage, only to miss it.
0:12:53|0:13:2|[Shimiao] didn't notice [Shifen] sneaking up behind her as she spoke. In the blink of an eye, both sausages were taken away. [Shifen] grinned smugly as she bit into the sausages and swayed.
0:13:11|0:13:18|Shimiao choked on a sausage and said incoherently,
0:13:31|0:13:45|Watching [Shifen] acting smugly, [Shimiao] screamed in anger and ran towards her, scolding as she ran. [Shifen] ran very fast and soon disappeared. [Shimiao] chased after her and turned into a dark tunnel, where strange items were piled up.
0:13:47|0:14:3|[Shimiao] shouted but no one responded to her. Eerie dripping sounds echoed in the empty tunnel. [Shimiao] stood at the entrance of the tunnel, hesitating to move. She took out her phone from her bag, turned on the flashlight, and frowned as she shone it around. Fear slowly crept into her heart.
0:14:6|0:14:24|At this moment, [Shimiao] was startled by a doll hanging upside down without arms on the top of the tunnel. The tattered cloth around was blowing in the wind, creating a creepy atmosphere. Despite her fear, [Shimiao] slowly stepped forward, tiptoeing along. The small lamp on the wall flickered mysteriously.
0:14:59|0:15:4|[Shifen] suddenly appeared from behind, causing [Shimiao] to scream in fright and stand frozen in place.
0:15:5|0:15:13|Shimiao picked up the school bag and smashed it towards Shifen, who laughed and ran away.
0:16:34|0:16:42|Mom comforted the aggrieved [Shimiao], then turned and gave a big eye roll to [Shifen]. [Shimiao] watched as mom hurriedly left, standing in place sadly.
0:16:58|0:17:8|Dad sitting on the sofa suddenly stood up, roared angrily at the siblings playing around, then walked towards the door. After a slamming sound of the door, only the two siblings were left in the room.
0:17:46|0:17:52|On the phone, [Miao Miaomiao] didn't pay attention, only focusing on the updates of her idol.
0:17:59|0:18:10|Shimiao was still feeling down, but she was interrupted by a phone call from her best friend, so she put down her phone in disappointment. Shifen was sitting on the bed in the bedroom, playing a voice-controlled game, howling excitedly at the phone.
0:18:10|0:18:33|[Shifen] was feeling full of pent-up anger with nowhere to vent, but when she saw [Shimiao] dancing around, she couldn't hold it in any longer. She stormed into the room littered with scraps of paper, glaring fiercely at [Shifen] as she shouted at her. Ignoring her sister's scolding, [Shifen] continued playing her game without even looking up. Feeling helpless, [Shimiao] pondered for a moment before picking up the Iron Man action figure on the table.
0:18:33|0:18:43|She then moved a nearby stool and stood on it, leaning over the edge of the upper bunk bed, looking expressionlessly at [Shifen] on the bed, slowly raising the figurine in her hand, as if about to break it.
0:19:6|0:19:18|She snatched the phone from [Shifen]'s hand and threw it away, then caught the one placed in front of [Shifen]. [Shifen] was immersed in the game, yelling loudly at the phone. In a fit of anger, [Shimiao] took the phone away, forcefully interrupting the game.
0:19:31|0:19:39|[Shifen] gives [Shimiao] another bag of puffed food, while also scaring her. [Shimiao] glares fiercely at [Shifen] and throws the snack bag at her.
0:19:39|0:20:6|Shifen glanced back at Shimiao vigilantly, then turned around humming a song and walked out. Shimiao, feeling annoyed, stomped on the snacks that had fallen on the ground in frustration. After venting her anger, she suddenly noticed a flyer on the table. Upon picking it up, she saw it was a promotional activity for her brother Shifen's card collection. Shimiao pushed aside the snacks covering the table, revealing a nearly completed puzzle. She looked up in shock.
0:20:9|0:20:33|She held up the flyer in front of her eyes, looking at the grand prize on it and getting lost in fantasy. In her imagination, the whole family of [Shimiao] won the grand prize, surrounded by applause and cheers. The family of four put on clothes just like the cartoon characters on the flyer, with horns on their heads. [Shimiao] couldn't help but smile, her mouth curling up like a fool in her daydream.
0:20:33|0:21:2|Shifen walked out of the bathroom and was startled by Shimiao in front of her. Shimiao was holding a laundry basket and looking at Shifen with a flattering expression. Shifen looked at the unusual Shimiao as if she was a monster, threw her clothes into the basket, wiped her wet hair, turned around, and walked upstairs. Shimiao immediately put down the basket, ran out of the house, quickly ran up the stairs, and arrived upstairs before Shifen.
0:21:2|0:21:38|She stole a glance at the movement of [Shifen], took advantage of her not coming up yet, stood by the mirror and raised the hairdryer. When [Shifen] walked in, [Shimiao] shivered and took a step back, quite scared. [Shimiao], however, maintained a smile and handed the hairdryer to her. Worried that [Shimiao] might play a trick, [Shifen] turned on the hairdryer and aimed it at [Shimiao]'s face. Nothing happened. [Shifen] looked even more scared at [Shimiao]'s smile. Puzzled, she scratched her head and walked towards the door.
0:21:38|0:21:47|She was worried that [Shimiao] would sneak up on her, so she couldn't help but turn her head to look at her. [Shimiao] responded with a pair of innocent eyes, and [Shifen] left uneasily.
0:21:47|0:22:4|Upon seeing [Shimiao] walk out, [Shifen] immediately turned and ran downstairs. Just as [Shifen] walked down the stairs, she came to the living room, rubbing her hair, and sat on the sofa. Suddenly, a hand next to her placed a glass of juice in front of her, causing [Shifen] to shrink into a ball, her eyes widening in shock.
0:22:28|0:22:35|Shimiao said, taking out Shifen's puzzle from the side,
0:22:50|0:23:15|[Shimiao] nodded obediently and handed the puzzle to [Shifen]. [Shifen] reached out carefully to take it, but [Shimiao] refused to let go. [Shifen] pulled with all her might, while [Shimiao] looked at her with a smile on her face. Suddenly, she let go of the puzzle, and [Shimiao] made a victorious gesture towards the lying [Shifen]. Still shocked from the previous scare, [Shifen] sat motionless holding the puzzle.
0:23:15|0:23:22|Shimiao walked to the stairs and suddenly turned around, looking at Shifen, saying,
0:23:23|0:23:40|[Shifen] turned to look at the affected [Shimiao], grimacing in pain. [Shimiao] skipped upstairs, excitedly rushing to her own bed. Then she shouted from behind, as [Shifen] slowly made her way upstairs, reluctantly pressing the switch on the wall.
0:23:40|0:24:0|The next day, [Shimiao] and [Shifen] arrived at a convenience store. In front of them were several boxes filled with puffed snacks. [Shifen] glanced disapprovingly at the shopkeeper, while [Shimiao] turned her head coldly towards [Shifen] and sighed, saying,
0:24:56|0:25:13|Working [Shimiao]'s mother turned her head and looked over, seeing the flowers in front of her with a puzzled expression. She picked up the card on the bouquet, opened it, and fell silent upon reading it, her face turning very ugly. Meanwhile, the customers and children beside her were laughing very happily.
0:25:13|0:25:31|After a busy day at work, as the sky darkened, [Shimiao]'s mother stood by the window, staring blankly at the outside scenery, feeling low. Then, with red eyes, she turned around and looked at the bouquet behind her, picked it up and walked out. Back at home, she threw the flowers in front of her father.
0:25:38|0:25:53|[Shifen] walked over, picked up the card on the flowers and said, "Dad roared angrily, and Mom got even angrier. She picked up the flowers and was about to throw them out."
0:26:3|0:26:20|Shimiao suddenly rushed over and hugged her mother, calming her anger. Her mother then turned around, tenderly holding Shimiao's face and giving her a kiss, before embracing her in her arms. Meanwhile, her brother Shifen stood by with a cold expression. Shimiao's face was filled with a happy smile, but to everyone's surprise, her mother decisively turned around and left the scene.
0:26:20|0:26:44|Shimiao watched her mother leave, the smile on her face slowly disappearing. She stood there, her carefully planned scheme failed. Shimiao, feeling wronged, her eyes turning red, was about to get angry when she saw Shifen putting flowers on her head and making a funny gesture. Shimiao burst into tears of laughter.
0:27:9|0:27:16|[Shimiao] looked at [Miao Miaomiao] with an urgent gaze and said after a moment of thought, she was shocked by her bad idea.
0:27:20|0:27:29|Shimiao was at a loss for words for a moment and could only cry with a sad face. Suddenly, she received a text message, and the dark clouds on her face disappeared instantly.
0:27:48|0:28:5|[Shimiao] pulled [Miao Miaomiao] with excitement and laughter, then she went alone to the entrance of the ice cream shop. However, she didn't see her brother [Zhen Kaixin], only receiving a text message from [Shifen]. The message read, "Sis, no one is inviting you for ice cream, my bad."
0:28:5|0:28:15|If you're already there, just grab me an ice cream on your way back, [Shimiao] angrily closed her phone, took a few steps, then turned back to kick the toy at the store entrance before leaving.
0:28:18|0:28:45|[Shimiao] was alone, leaning on the railing of the bridge, eating ice cream. She frowned in grievance, pouting, surrounded by the laughter of a group of children. She turned her head and saw several children waving toys in the company of their parents, who smiled indulgently and blew bubbles for them. [Shimiao] looked at them with envy.
0:28:51|0:29:20|She felt very wronged, stared at her phone blankly, then put it down and looked at the river under the bridge. The reflection of the opposite building on the water surface was particularly beautiful in the sunset. [Shimiao] seemed to remember something, suddenly picked up her phone, dialed the home number, hoping her dad would answer. However, there was no one at home, and her dad, dressed in a suit and holding a briefcase, was lying drunk at the doorstep, snoring unconsciously, with even the keys dropped on the ground beside him.
0:29:20|0:29:26|The phone rang for a long time without anyone answering, [Shimiao] hung up disappointedly, muttering to herself.
0:29:33|0:30:3|She wrote on her phone with emotions, word by word. Seemingly in a fit of anger, she finished her sentence fiercely, then calmed down and looked across. A figure caught her attention - it was [Shimiao]'s mother and a strange man appearing by the riverbank. Walking side by side, [Shimiao] recognized her mother and quickly turned away, preparing to find a way to the other side.
0:30:4|0:30:31|The sun quickly set, and the riverside became brightly lit with lights. The water also reflected scattered lights, and [Shimiao] still held an unfinished ice cream jar in her hand. She found where her mother was, only to see her mother walking towards her with a strange man. [Shimiao] quickly hid to observe secretly, and saw the two of them entering a restaurant. Only then did she stick her head out and hurriedly followed. She hid outside the restaurant, peering in.
0:30:36|0:30:46|Unexpectedly, [Shimiao] found her brother [Shifen] also appeared in the restaurant. The scene in front of her greatly shocked [Shimiao], and she desperately wanted to know what they were talking about, but she couldn't hear clearly.
0:30:47|0:30:53|She turned around to look for the window on the other side of the restaurant, and then she saw three people chatting harmoniously.
0:31:8|0:31:36|Seeing the three of them chatting and laughing, seeing the bright smile on her brother's face, [Shimiao] understood everything. In an instant, her eyes became moist. She looked coldly at the three people in front of her, slowly turned around and left. She felt her world collapsing, never expecting that the person closest to her had been deceiving her all along, shattering all the hopes she had carefully maintained.
0:31:37|0:31:58|She ignored a clown waving at her beside her, walking on the road like a zombie, still tightly holding the ice cream that had turned into water. [Shimiao] walked for a long time, finally stopping in front of a dilapidated old ship. She looked up at the ship in contemplation, disappointment evident in her eyes. At this moment, an old man picking up trash appeared beside her.
0:31:59|0:32:13|The old man, dressed in tattered clothes with messy hair under his hat, was asked by [Shimiao]. He replied while picking up bottles,
0:32:22|0:32:26|Shimiao looked up again and watched the steamship sink into contemplation.
0:32:26|0:32:48|She couldn't help but walk into the cabin, wanting to see the memories of her childhood. The cabin was pitch black, with only a beam of light shining in from outside, barely allowing her to see. [Shimiao] walked down the stairs, and several pigeons lurking here scattered when they heard the noise. She looked at the desolation in front of her, with a lonely expression, and suddenly childhood happy memories rushed into her heart.
0:33:6|0:33:34|In the memory, the family celebrated [Shimiao]'s birthday when she was a child. Her brother [Shifen] sat beside her, while their parents sat opposite each other, showing affection as always. The family sang a birthday song for Shimiao, creating a harmonious atmosphere. As the scene shifts back to reality, Shimiao finds the table from her memory. She leans on the table, tears streaming down uncontrollably. At that moment, [Shifen] appears outside the ferry, wearing a school uniform, helmet, and riding a new electric bike.
0:33:34|0:33:40|Before long, she rode the electric bike into the cabin, and the headlights of the bike illuminated the dark restaurant.
0:33:40|0:34:7|On the side, a pigeon suddenly flew up, startling [Shifen] who quickly stopped. [Shimiao] remained silent, just staring at [Shifen]'s electric bike. Unaware of [Shifen]'s low spirits, [Shimiao] continued to inspect the surroundings on her own. She pressed a hidden switch in the corner, and the ship was instantly enveloped in light.
0:34:23|0:34:29|[Shifen] excitedly twists and turns in the seat,
0:34:59|0:35:8|[Shifen] took out her phone and turned the screen towards [Shimiao], revealing a virtual dynamic candle.
0:35:42|0:35:55|As the candle went out, the birthday song sung by [Shifen] for [Shimiao] played on the phone. Following that, the smoke from the candle enveloped the entire city, and [Shimiao] appeared in the classroom.
0:35:59|0:36:16|In a drowsy state, [Shimiao] was pulled up from the desk by [Miao Miaomiao] and hurriedly left the classroom. The two arrived at the basketball court, where an exciting and tense basketball game was taking place. The stands were full, with everyone holding cheer sticks and cheering for their school.
0:36:16|0:36:24|The cheerleaders below the stage were also not to be outdone, shouting in unison. [Shifen], wearing the number 23 jersey, appeared in the center of the field, becoming the focus.
0:36:25|0:36:48|She skillfully maneuvered the ball and interacted with her teammates. With a fake move, she smoothly threw the ball in, prompting cheers from the sidelines. [Miao Miaomiao] shouted [Shifen]'s name, excitedly embracing [Shimiao] next to her. [Shimiao] looked puzzled at [Miao Miaomiao], as [Shifen] scored two points for the school. Celebrating with her teammates on the sidelines, [Miao Miaomiao] in the stands mimicked the same movements.
0:37:3|0:37:23|Miaomiao shouted excitedly, while Shimiao next to her had a gloomy face and put her phone in her pocket. At that moment, Shifen jumped up to shoot, but was knocked down by the opponent. After falling to the ground, Shifen fainted. Miaomiao immediately turned around to look for an exit, while Shimiao directly climbed over the guardrail and ran straight towards the court.
0:37:23|0:38:4|She checked on Shifen's condition, Shimiao rushed aggressively towards the player who committed a foul, knocking him down. Miaomiao shouted for her brother as she ran over, Shifen suddenly woke up. Miaomiao was startled and angrily patted Shimiao. The two stood still for a moment before heading to the medical room. Shifen teased her sister as usual, only this time it was Miao Miaomiao.
0:38:14|0:38:22|She suddenly noticed a list on the table next to her, picked it up and saw the name [Shifen] written on it.
0:38:37|0:38:42|Miao Miaomiao stood still, looking puzzled, and asked,
0:39:16|0:39:22|[Shimiao] looked up at [Wan Sui], who felt uneasy under the gaze and quickly averted his eyes before hurriedly leaving.
0:40:12|0:40:20|[Shifen] viciously pinched [Miao Miaomiao] from behind,
0:40:26|0:40:41|[Shimiao] hid at the doorway, taking everything in. She couldn't accept this outrageous fact. After school, [Shifen] and [Miao Miaomiao] frolicked all the way, with [Shimiao] following behind. She watched the two intimate friends and felt extremely wronged.
0:40:49|0:40:57|After suppressing her emotions all the way, [Shimiao] finally couldn't hold it anymore. [Miao Miaomiao] and [Shifen] turned to look at her. After a moment of contemplation, [Shimiao] spoke,
0:41:4|0:41:12|Facing Shimiao's question, the two of them nodded in unison, and Shimiao analyzed seriously,
0:42:28|0:42:49|In the wardrobe, there were no clothes of [Shimiao], even her daily necessities had disappeared. [Shimiao] stood still, realizing the seriousness of the situation. She returned to her room and found that even the spare change in the piggy bank had miraculously returned. Looking around, the stickers and posters on the walls had all turned into things she liked.
0:42:49|0:43:4|The entire house no longer had a trace of the existence of [Shifen], the brother. At this moment, the mother called, and [Shimiao] eagerly answered the phone. The living room's photo wall also no longer had the figure of [Shifen].
0:43:12|0:43:38|[Shimiao] replied while looking around incredulously. Once again, she noticed that she was the only one left on the height markings on the living room pillar. Even the restaurant in her memory had not closed down. Opening the fridge, [Shimiao] saw a variety of snacks inside and couldn't help but laugh. She casually took out two pieces of bread, staring at the fridge filled with food in a daze. In disbelief, she muttered to herself,
0:43:38|0:43:55|She became more and more excited as she watched, and all of [Shimiao]'s confusion was washed away by the joy of enjoying the meal alone.
0:43:55|0:44:15|She sat on the sofa holding an ice cream, carefully scooping out a small piece with a spoon. When the taste of the ice cream touched her tongue, she instantly showed an incredibly happy expression. Unable to resist, she started eating it heartily, feeling her soul being uplifted.
0:44:15|0:44:26|[Shimiao] put aside her brother [Shifen]'s disappearance and finally became the only child as she wished. She then changed into clean clothes and tied up her hair before arriving at the restaurant that was supposed to have closed down.
0:44:27|0:44:40|The ship was surrounded by colorful lights, just like in childhood, it became lively and extraordinary. From a distance, it looked like a grand party was being held. [Shimiao] slowly walked up and lingered around the ship.
0:44:40|0:44:53|She then walked into the cabin and immediately saw her parents dressed up. When her mother saw [Shimiao], she waved affectionately at her, signaling her to come over. [Shimiao] almost ran over, looking at her parents, she instantly burst into a smile.
0:45:8|0:45:23|Mom touched [Shimiao]'s face, and [Shimiao] took both of their hands and put them together, saying. Dad smiled kindly and said,
0:45:34|0:45:40|Mom touched Shimiao's heart, not wanting to embarrass her. The three looked up at the romantic lights around them, and Dad said,
0:45:43|0:46:7|Dad stood up as he spoke, and before Mom could react, he pulled her towards the dance floor. The two of them danced to the beautiful music, occasionally casting indulgent smiles at [Shimiao]. Watching the graceful dance of their parents, [Miaomiao] couldn't stop smiling, as if she were in a beautiful dream, back at home enjoying the exclusive love of her parents, freely skating around the house.
0:46:7|0:46:18|Dad sat at the desk in the study working, while Mom sat on the sofa in the living room looking at her phone. What Shimiao didn't notice was the bottle of alcohol hidden under the desk by Dad, and the disappearing smile on Mom's face.
0:46:19|0:46:27|At night, [Shimiao] lay on the bed and habitually shouted out. She had just closed her eyes when she suddenly realized that [Shifen] was no longer at home.
0:46:30|0:46:46|A hint of disappointment flashed across her face, but it was soon overshadowed by the emotions of [Zhen Kaixin]. She smiled and called out again, "Dad, walking up the stairs, looked at [Shimiao] affectionately and said with a smile,
0:46:50|0:47:9|After turning off the lights, Dad turned his head and made a scissor gesture towards [Shimiao]. The next day, [Shimiao] proudly rode an electric bike in her school uniform past the bus stop. Wearing headphones with a satisfied smile on her face, she walked calmly to school, feeling extremely happy that she no longer had to squeeze onto the bus or worry about being late.
0:47:9|0:47:14|At this moment, she encountered [Miao Miaomiao] running wildly on the road.
0:48:3|0:48:10|[Miao Miaomiao] clasped her hands together in a gesture of grievance, furrowing her brow and looking up at [Shimiao] with innocent, wide eyes.
0:48:23|0:48:41|Kaixin smiled and said to Wan Xing. Wan Xing looked at Kaixin coldly without saying a word, while Shimiao beside her showed a silly smile. Miaomiao was hanging in the air, screaming in terror at the monster puppet beside her.
0:48:59|0:49:14|The scene shifts, [Miao Miaomiao] has filled the floor with lunch boxes at home, while bustling around to serve the food on the side. When [Shimiao] walks in, she is stunned by this spectacular sight and laughs, saying,
0:49:36|0:49:53|[Shifen] walked in with a bunch of screaming chickens hanging on him. He swaggered in, swaying his hips, holding a screaming chicken in his hand instead of answering for himself to [Miao Miaomiao]. [Shimiao] sat down on the ground and couldn't help but stare at him.
0:50:11|0:50:18|Miao Miaomiao rushed forward to grab it as soon as she noticed it.
0:50:32|0:50:37|[Shifen] opened a bottle of drink next to her and started drinking. [Miao Miaomiao] realized and asked,
0:50:48|0:51:4|[Shimiao] sat on the ground watching the two playfully fighting, suddenly feeling like an outsider, she couldn't help but feel sad. She recalled the bits and pieces of her childhood with [Shifen], but the main characters of the story had now become [Shifen] and [Miao Miaomiao].
0:51:4|0:51:30|In her memories, [Shifen] snatched her sister's ice cream and even blocked the door, not letting her in. [Shimiao] returned to the empty house, every corner reminding her of [Shifen]. At this moment, [Shifen] was on the street looking for her drunken father, when her mother suddenly called. [Shifen] glanced at the phone, pondered for a moment, and then hung up.
0:51:30|0:51:52|Father lay on the roadside railing, drunk and unconscious. [Shifen] looked at him helplessly and with a touch of heartache, sighed. He walked over, squatted down, and stared at his father for a while. Then he snapped out of it, stood up, squatted beside his father, took out a cigarette, put it in his father's mouth, and carefully lit it with a lighter. Father was sleeping too soundly, showing no reaction.
0:51:53|0:52:2|[Shifen] sat on the ground waiting for her father to wake up. A considerate aunt passed by and picked up a small stool, saying to [Shifen],
0:52:3|0:52:21|[Shifen] nodded, smiled politely, waved to the aunt, and the father beside him started coughing from the smoke. [Shifen] quickly took out the cigarette, saw that the father was still unconscious, and once again put the cigarette in his mouth. Then he waited quietly on the side, staring blankly at the sky.
0:52:21|0:52:36|In the late night with no one around, [Shifen] finally lifted his father on his back to go home. His face was cold and expressionless, completely different from the cheerful [Shifen] during the day. With his frail body, he carried his father and took heavy steps forward.
0:52:41|0:52:52|The next day, [Miao Miaomiao] stood by the school fence buying sausages. [Shifen] walked by from the side, signaling to his friend beside him, then sneaked forward and hid in the crowd.
0:52:52|0:53:5|[Miao Miaomiao] bought a sausage, walking back while smelling the fragrance, completely unaware of [Shifen] in the crowd. [Zhen Kaixin] deliberately waved to [Miao Miaomiao] to attract her attention, while [Shifen] sneaked up from behind and took a bite out of [Miao Miaomiao]'s sausage.
0:53:38|0:54:0|[Shifen] grabbed [Kaixin]'s water bottle and started drinking. When he got home, [Wan Xing] took out a drink from the fridge. Just as he was about to open the bottle, [Wan Sui] suddenly appeared, snatched the bottle from [Wan Xing], took a sip, and then handed it back to him. [Wan Xing] stood still, watching [Wan Sui] walk away, lost in thought.
0:54:0|0:54:16|But the next morning, when [Wan Sui] left for school, he found the bottle of drink on the dining table. He picked it up and saw his name on the bottle. Opening the fridge, [Wan Sui] discovered that everything was labeled with the names of [Wan Sui] and [Wan Xing].
0:54:17|0:54:40|At this moment, [Shimiao] and [Miao Miaomiao] are browsing through the fan merchandise store. However, [Miao Miaomiao] is feeling down, staying silent and reluctantly pursing her lips. [Shimiao] rolls her eyes and suddenly [Shifen] runs over.
0:55:50|0:55:57|[Shimiao] grabbed [Shifen]'s school bag and the puzzle pieces inside scattered all over the floor, but she was unrepentant.
0:56:15|0:56:21|[Shifen] complained to [Zhen Kaixin] and [Wan Sui],
0:56:35|0:56:40|Shifen, Zhen Kaixin, and Wan Sui were squatting by the roadside, searching for rare cards in the puffed food.
0:57:4|0:57:16|[Shifen] quickly turned around and saw a child buying a pack of instant noodles, taking out the rare card that [Shifen] had been longing for. [Shifen] revealed a hungry wolf-like look in the eyes.
0:57:40|0:57:45|[Shimiao] and [Miao Miaomiao] are watching the little rabbits by the roadside.
0:57:54|0:58:6|[Shifen] panicked and blurted out incoherently, [Shimiao] and [Miao Miaomiao] noticed the situation here. Just as [Shifen] was about to turn and run, more people came from behind.
0:58:18|0:58:43|Shimiao had Miaomiao call the police, then she chased after them without hesitation. Shifen and the others were chased by the gang and ran straight to the escalator ahead. Several gang members followed closely behind, with one of them running towards the adjacent elevator, trying to intercept them halfway. Shifen and the others ran forward in a very embarrassed manner, with the people behind them shouting not to run and relentlessly pursuing them.
0:58:44|0:59:5|At this moment, [Shimiao] rushed over and saw the chaotic scene upstairs. She hurriedly chased after them. Several thugs were already panting heavily as they ran away, but they refused to give up. [Shifen] and the other two panicked and ran upstairs without hesitation. Unconsciously, they reached the top floor. The three of them were stunned to see the dead-end rooftop. The young thugs behind them also caught up. [Shifen] had a sudden inspiration and threw herself into the corner of the rooftop.
0:59:7|0:59:25|He picked up a few umbrellas and threw them to [Zhen Kaixin] and [Wan Sui] as weapons. Several young thugs, panting heavily, also began to look for handy weapons near the rooftop. [Shifen] and the other two opened the umbrellas, preparing to face the upcoming battle.
0:59:25|0:59:35|Shimiao suddenly stood up on the side, jumped in place on a nearby stool, delivered a flying kick to knock down a thug, and finally coolly threw the backpack to the side.
0:59:41|0:59:45|Shimiao's eyes were filled with killing intent as she unzipped her coat.
0:59:51|1:0:1|Several hooligans rushed towards [Shifen] and the lone [Shimiao], [Shimiao] showed amazing fighting skills, knocking down each hooligan who charged forward.
1:0:6|1:0:32|Three people cooperated tacitly to corner a burly thug, when suddenly the police arrived. [Miao Miaomiao] dragged [Shifen] and the other two away, leaving [Shimiao] and a few thugs behind. [Shimiao] looked around in confusion, not knowing what to do. The police pointed at [Shimiao] and paused when they saw the words on his clothes.
1:0:42|1:0:57|[Shimiao] squatted down, holding her head, and when she turned her head, she saw [Shifen]. [Shifen] sneaked back and squatted next to [Shimiao], raising her eyebrows at her. Later, several people were taken to the police station, a few thugs squatted in a row, with [Miao Miaomiao] and [Shifen] squatting across from them.
1:0:57|1:1:6|[Shimiao] stared fiercely at the few people in front of her, and the thugs also stared back at [Shimiao] without backing down. When [Shifen] saw the police coming in, she immediately straightened up.
1:1:10|1:1:34|[Shimiao] smiled at the praise from the police uncle, but was startled by his sudden loud reprimand, which scared off a few young delinquents across the street. The police uncle then dragged a chair over to the desk, sat down in front of [Shifen] and [Shimiao], and asked sternly. [Shimiao] hesitated for a moment before speaking. Glancing at [Shifen], [Shimiao] then...
1:1:59|1:2:17|The two immediately panicked, blaming each other. The police simply handed the phone to [Shimiao], who took it with tears in her eyes and looked to [Shifen] for help. However, [Shifen] helplessly furrowed his brow. [Shimiao] knew there was no choice but to compromise, so she dialed the number, but no one answered.
1:2:57|1:3:5|[Shimiao] was confused by the words, unable to distinguish between truth and falsehood for a moment. [Shifen] became more and more excited as she spoke, choking up.
1:3:16|1:3:22|[Shifen] looked at [Shimiao] with red eyes, while [Shimiao] looked at him in shock, immersed in his words.
1:3:42|1:4:1|And so, [Shifen] and [Shimiao] successfully left the police station. The two of them walked back slowly in the night. [Shimiao] suddenly stopped, and [Shifen] looked at her in confusion. She reached out and rubbed her head, and then [Shimiao] finally reacted, giving [Shifen] a punch with a smile.
1:4:12|1:4:19|Shimiao hadn't finished speaking when Shifen immediately changed the subject, interrupting her and speeding up to run ahead.
1:4:20|1:4:36|The two passed a corner, [Shifen] jumped up and patted the light bulb hanging on the wall. The light flickered on [Shimiao]'s face, pulling her thoughts back to childhood memories. [Shifen] stood on the stairs at this corner, holding a blade of grass in his hand, crying sadly.
1:5:1|1:5:26|Shimiao picked up the ice cream with tears in her eyes and ate it without any hesitation. Then she looked up at [Shifen] with a smile through her tears. [Shimiao] shook her head, snapped back to reality, and followed [Shifen] up the stairs. Walking alone on the roadside with her arms wide open, [Shifen] ran after her. Glancing at the tunnel ahead, [Shifen] asked [Shimiao] with her head down, and [Shimiao] replied.
1:6:42|1:7:7|[Shifen] crazily applied makeup to [Shimiao], who nodded affirmatively to [Miao Miaomiao]. After hesitating for a moment, [Shimiao] nodded in agreement. [Shifen] and [Miao Miaomiao] playfully ran down the stairs and returned home. [Shifen] came out carrying a pot and placed it on the dining table.
1:7:37|1:7:46|On the side, [Shimiao] was very accommodating, scooping up a lot into her own bowl with a spoon. To the shocked gaze of the two, she voraciously dug into [Shifen]'s dark cuisine.
1:8:24|1:8:38|The drunken father started to act crazy, and [Shifen] quickly covered his mouth, afraid of being heard by [Miao Miaomiao]. Meanwhile, [Miao Miaomiao] and [Shimiao] were in the bedroom, with [Shimiao] holding a cheering light stick and staring blankly.
1:8:52|1:9:8|Shimiao was startled by Miaomiao and let out a burp, widening her eyes. Meanwhile, Shifen and his father were chatting on the street, with his father sitting at the front of the car drinking. His father couldn't help but ask,
1:9:34|1:9:49|The father and son both had red eyes and fell silent. [Shimiao], who was hiding in the dark, also showed a look of sadness. She then left [Miao Miaomiao]'s house and returned home with a heavy heart. She never expected [Shifen], who seemed carefree in her memory, to have so many hidden worries.
1:9:49|1:10:0|The next day, [Shimiao] was walking to school when she suddenly ran into the sneaky [Miao Miaomiao]. [Miao Miaomiao] emerged from the corner, and [Shimiao] asked in surprise,
1:10:17|1:10:33|Shimiao started to search for Shifen's whereabouts in order to help Miaomiao. She went to a street stall and saw boys in school uniforms, approaching them to confirm if they were Shifen. She didn't even miss the arcade machines and fruit shops on the roadside, searching for Shifen's figure one after another.
1:10:33|1:10:39|And at this moment, [Shifen] was sitting in a mahjong parlor, playing mobile games on her phone, completely engrossed.
1:10:40|1:10:46|[Shimiao] walked by and saw [Shifen] from the side. She immediately stormed in with a frown on her face and questioned,
1:11:2|1:11:14|Shimiao turned and left as she spoke. Shifen immediately panicked and hurried to catch up. He looked around and whispered,
1:11:26|1:11:32|[Shifen] carefully picked up the grilled sausage, [Shimiao] shook her head.
1:12:12|1:12:32|I used to misunderstand [Shifen]. It turns out that at that time, Dad didn't actually leave the house. Instead, [Shifen] carried his drunken father back home in advance and hid him under the blanket, creating the illusion of him not being at home.
1:12:41|1:12:49|Shifen thought for a moment, smiled helplessly, and said
1:13:37|1:14:0|[Miao Miaomiao] snatched two sausages, handed one to [Shimiao], who took it, but [Shifen] bit off the other sausage in [Miao Miaomiao]'s hand and ran away. [Miao Miaomiao] chased after angrily, shouting, while [Shifen] deliberately twirled around in place with the sausage to tease [Miao Miaomiao].
1:14:0|1:14:8|Miao Miaomiao was about to catch up, but immediately turned around and ran away. Shimiao, on the other hand, followed behind the two with a dejected look, holding a sausage in her hand and staring into space.
1:14:8|1:14:23|She walked to a familiar intersection, looked up at the two-story pedestrian bridge, and suddenly recalled the memory of [Shimiao] hiding next to the railing of the bridge, playing hide-and-seek with [Shifen]. She waited for a long time but [Shifen] did not show up, so she got up to look for her.
1:14:23|1:14:49|She passed by a roadside stall and went straight to the arcade machine on the side of the road, only to see [Shifen] sitting in front of the machine, playing the airplane landing game frantically. [Shimiao] gritted her teeth as she watched [Shifen], who had a provocative expression on his face. The scene shifted to the school, where [Miao Miaomiao] walked alone in the campus. [Shifen] walked with his hands in his pockets behind her, and he accidentally caught a glimpse of [Miao Miaomiao]'s back. He immediately straightened up and cautiously approached [Miao Miaomiao].
1:14:49|1:15:5|He skillfully patted his sister's right shoulder, then took a bite of her sausage from the left side. As they locked eyes, [Shifen] realized that the person in front of her was [Shimiao], and the atmosphere became awkward. [Shifen] took the sausage out of her mouth and slowly put it back on the skewer.
1:16:7|1:16:15|Shimiao nodded after some thought.
1:16:34|1:16:50|At that moment, Miao Miaomiao walked into the classroom humming a song, Shimiao and Wan Xing's conversation came to a sudden halt as they both looked at Miao Miaomiao. Miao Miaomiao walked to her seat, picked up her backpack, waved to Shimiao and Wan Xing, then turned and left.
1:16:59|1:17:20|[Shimiao] fell into contemplation, she didn't know if she was worried about [Miao Miaomiao] or missing [Shifen]. [Shimiao] turned her eyes and suddenly saw [Shifen] passing by outside the window. [Shifen] was walking on the road just fine, then suddenly looked terrified, rushed to the corner in panic. Seeing this, [Shimiao] walked to the window in confusion, secretly observing [Shifen]'s strange behavior.
1:17:21|1:17:30|Miao Miaomiao appeared in Shimiao's sight, focusing on playing with her phone. Shifen quickly ran up the stairs, hiding in a corner waiting for Miao Miaomiao to leave.
1:17:30|1:17:55|Miao Miaomiao completely ignored Shifen and walked straight ahead. Shifen immediately got up and ran in the opposite direction. Shimiao, seeing this, picked up her backpack, climbed out of the classroom window on the first floor, and followed Shifen's strange behavior aroused Shimiao's suspicion. With her backpack on, Shimiao hurriedly followed them. She followed Shifen out of the campus, unaware of the tail behind her, walking briskly forward.
1:17:55|1:17:58|He did not walk towards home, but took a unfamiliar route.
1:18:1|1:18:27|When passing through an intersection, there was a poster of [Miao Miaomiao]'s idol concert on the roadside. [Shifen] stopped and looked at it, then continued walking forward. [Shimiao] had been secretly following him all the way, and [Shifen] didn't notice anyone following him. They walked to the bottom of a building, where [Miao Miaomiao]'s mother was standing by the roadside. When [Shifen] saw her, she walked up to her. The mother seemed to have been waiting for a long time, and [Shifen] shouted coldly,
1:18:27|1:18:36|The mother came to her senses and looked behind [Shifen].
1:18:46|1:18:54|The mother fell into silence, not knowing how to respond. After a moment of contemplation, she asked,
1:19:25|1:19:33|[Shifen]'s series of questions made [Shimiao], who was hiding in the corner, pale with shock. She immediately turned around, hopped on her electric bike, and rushed towards [Miao Miaomiao]'s house without hesitation.
1:19:34|1:19:48|At this moment, [Miao Miaomiao] is in the bedroom choosing what to wear when going out. Standing in front of the mirror, she twists and turns. [Shimiao] rushes all the way and arrives just in time as [Miao Miaomiao] is about to leave.
1:20:24|1:20:29|Miao Miaomiao turned away angrily, and Shimiao stepped forward to snatch the lantern from Miao Miaomiao's hand.
1:20:50|1:20:56|[Miao Miaomiao] angrily kicked [Shimiao], tears swirling in her eyes. [Shimiao] stood there in a daze.
1:21:24|1:21:40|After saying that, she left without looking back, while [Shifen] kept watching them from a distance. [Miao Miaomiao] ignored the presence of [Shifen], who looked at the departing [Miao Miaomiao] and walked over helplessly. [Shimiao] stood in place with moist eyes, not understanding what she had done wrong.
1:21:41|1:21:46|[Shifen] walked straight to the roadside, picked up the sign on the ground, and dusted it off.
1:21:47|1:21:56|He ignored [Shimiao] and chased after [Miao Miaomiao] in the direction she left with the lantern. That night, [Shimiao] sulkily pushed around the steak on the plate.
1:22:52|1:23:0|Dad and Mom both froze, shocked, and looked at each other. Dad put down his fork and said with a hint of reproach,
1:23:21|1:23:30|The two of them froze again. The mother dropped the knife and fork in her hand, looked at the father in confusion, and [Shimiao] sighed.
1:24:18|1:24:40|Mom shook her head with red eyes, [Shimiao] recalled every moment with [Shifen], stood up resolutely and left. Dad shouted from behind, but [Shimiao] walked away without looking back, wiping tears as she left the restaurant.
1:24:40|1:25:7|At this moment, [Miao Miaomiao] is sleeping soundly at home with headphones on, while [Shifen] is quietly packing up his belongings. He carefully places his beloved figurines from the shelf into a cardboard box, then takes out a piece of paper with a transfer application written on it. The reason stated is that his parents are divorcing and he needs to move back to his father's hometown. [Shifen] looks at the transfer application in silence for a long time, then moves the packed items to the table by the door.
1:25:7|1:25:36|At this moment, [Shimiao] was walking on the street, feeling low. The street lights were on as she passed rows of shops and roadside stalls with her head down. When she looked up, she came face to face with [Shifen], who was slowly walking with a cardboard box in his arms. [Shifen] stopped at the entrance of a shop, saw [Shimiao] approaching, and smiled. Placing the box on the shop's table, [Shifen] started taking things out while saying to [Shimiao],
1:25:40|1:25:45|[Shimiao] said, [Shimiao] raised her head and turned her eyes to ask,
1:26:10|1:26:19|Shimiao came to her senses, looked at the things cherished by Shifen in front of her, widened her eyes and asked,
1:27:5|1:27:23|[Shifen] lowered her head in silence, calmed her emotions, and then answered casually. [Shimiao] widened her eyes in disbelief and couldn't say a word. Then the two of them walked towards home.
1:27:43|1:28:1|He patted Shimiao's head, pretending to smile casually. Shimiao took a few steps, turned and went up the stairs. Shifen stood still and watched Shimiao leave. As Shimiao walked away, she slowed down her pace, couldn't help but stop, turned her head and found the intersection empty.
1:28:1|1:28:25|She walked downstairs, habitually took out her phone to use as a flashlight, suddenly saw a light shining from the side, only to see [Shifen] standing on the overpass, using a flashlight to light up [Shimiao]. [Shifen] raised the flashlight, grinning, as [Shimiao] turned and walked up the stairs. The steps became clear under the light, and [Shimiao] walked up step by step, looking back at [Shifen].
1:28:25|1:28:34|[Shifen] followed [Shimiao]'s figure with the light in her hand, accompanying [Shimiao] up layer after layer of stairs until [Shimiao] returned home.
1:28:35|1:28:45|[Shimiao] stood on the rooftop of the house, stretched her head down to look for [Shifen]'s figure. After realizing that [Shifen] was no longer there, [Shimiao] turned around in disappointment and left.
1:28:45|1:28:58|She came to the other end of the rooftop, boredly looking around. In the center of the rooftop was a swing, surrounded by green plants by the railing, looking especially beautiful in the quiet night.
1:28:58|1:29:21|[Shimiao] sat on the swing with a melancholy expression. She looked around at the night scene and called [Wan Xing]. [Wan Xing] responded quickly. After a pause, [Shimiao] looked up at the sky and said after a moment of contemplation,
1:29:23|1:29:34|On the other end of the phone, [Wan Xing] hung up and turned to look at [Wan Sui] who was lounging on the sofa with his legs crossed, watching TV. His laughter was infectious, but it was unclear what he found so amusing.
1:30:12|1:30:17|Shimiao was stunned, slowly raised her head to look at Miao Miaomiao. Wan Xing then stuck a post-it note on.
1:30:17|1:30:48|Shimiao turned her head and glared fiercely at Wan Xing after watching, then she stood in the corridor with two bottles of drinks after class, waiting for something. A poster on the roadside advertised an event of catching rare cards in the real-life doll machine at the mall. Soon, she arrived at the mall, being suspended in the air and slowly descending. When she reached the ground, she anxiously picked up a snack bag from the floor, imitating Shifen's shaking gesture by her ear, listening for the sound of the rare card.
1:30:48|1:31:7|She picked up one pack after another, with Kaixin waiting happily on the sidelines for the staff to find Shimiao, who was taking too long. When one round ended and Shimiao hadn't found the rare card, she was unwilling to give up and lined up again. Kaixin tentatively asked,
1:31:18|1:31:30|[Shimiao] had a pale face, with sweat sticking her disheveled hair to her cheeks. After speaking, she turned to look at the queue ahead, unwilling to rest for a moment. [Kaixin] looked at [Shimiao] with concern, then took off her own jacket.
1:31:31|1:31:35|He squatted down and tied the coat around [Shimiao]'s waist, saying,
1:31:38|1:31:43|Shimiao glanced at the coat around her waist, then looked up at Zhen Kaixin, finally revealing a slight smile.
1:31:44|1:31:49|It's [Shimiao]'s turn to take the stage. She dives into the pile of snacks, shaking each one next to her ear.
1:32:18|1:32:29|[Zhen Kaixin] hurriedly lifted [Shimiao] up, and [Shimiao] excitedly danced in the air. She couldn't wait to unwrap the package, only to find a puzzle piece instead of a rare card.
1:32:29|1:32:45|[Shimiao] refused to believe what she saw, shaking the bag desperately, but there was nothing left. On the sidelines, [Zhen Kaixin] watched [Shimiao], realizing she hadn't caught anything, and the smile on her face gradually disappeared. As [Shimiao] landed, a staff member stepped forward to take the bag and said,
1:32:51|1:33:16|Applause erupted from the sidelines. [Shimiao] snapped out of it and looked incredulously at the rare card in the staff's hand. Before she could react, [Zhen Kaixin] walked over, lifted [Shimiao] up in a bear hug, and handed her the rare card. The two then left, with the staff shouting after them. [Kaixin] carried [Shimiao] without looking back, while [Shimiao] had her arm around [Kaixin]'s neck.
1:33:16|1:33:35|With another hand holding a rare card, she stared at [Kaixin], her eyes shining, momentarily lost in thought. At this moment, [Kaixin] seemed like a hero, saving the experienced [Shimiao] from danger. The scene then shifted to [Miao Miaomiao]'s bedroom, where [Shimiao] was holding a rare card, smiling foolishly.
1:33:57|1:34:6|Miao Miaomiao's eyes welled up instantly, choking back tears as she spoke incoherently,
1:34:17|1:34:25|Shimiao blurted out these words in a moment of impatience, Miaomiao remained silent with her head down. Shimiao realized afterwards and wanted to explain.
1:34:57|1:35:20|After opening up to each other, they shared a smile. Sunlight streamed into the room, illuminating the photo of [Shifen] on the table. Upon returning home, [Shimiao] opened the calendar and calculated the dates. She circled the leap month of September and quickly found the date of her next lunar birthday. Using a watercolor pen, she wrote the word "birthday" in the blank space, then fell into deep thought.
1:35:20|1:35:42|Outside the window, the sound of a horn suddenly rang out. [Shimiao] snapped out of her daze, set down her watercolor brush on the coffee table, and walked out of the house to the edge of the rooftop. Peering out, she saw [Shifen] in a denim jacket and helmet, riding a brand-new electric bike. [Shifen] waved at [Shimiao], who smiled back, then turned and headed downstairs. [Shifen] slowly reversed the electric bike to the stairwell, waiting for [Shimiao].
1:35:42|1:36:11|[Shimiao] ran down the stairs with a look of surprise on her face, while [Shifen] sat in a chair twisting around, showing off her new electric car. Suddenly, [Shimiao] remembered her birthday when [Shifen] also showed off her new car in front of her, causing her to lose focus. [Shimiao] looked dazed, paused for a moment, and said,
1:36:16|1:36:22|[Shifen] raised her eyebrows at [Shimiao],
1:36:52|1:36:55|Shimiao's eyes welled up with tears as she spoke.
1:37:24|1:37:38|But she couldn't speak, she didn't know how to answer, just staring at [Shifen], who was startled, his expression gradually becoming serious.
1:37:38|1:38:4|The sky gradually darkened, with [Shifen] riding an electric bike and [Shimiao] sitting behind him. [Shifen] was ready to help [Shimiao] find her lost brother. They passed through a dim alley and crossed a bridge, arriving near the ship restaurant. [Shifen] looked up at the ship, parked the bike to the side, and [Shimiao] took off her helmet. They walked up the steps to the deck. Perhaps because it was night, there were not many customers on the ship.
1:38:4|1:38:19|The waiter was busy clearing the dining table, while [Shifen] and [Shimiao] wandered around the boat on their own. [Shifen] stopped, looked down in disbelief, and asked, leaving [Shimiao] momentarily speechless, unsure how to explain to [Shifen], and could only nod.
1:38:21|1:38:28|The two walked into the cabin, the restaurant was empty, the tables were all cleaned up, only a few dim lights were still on.
1:38:59|1:39:5|Tears welled up in her eyes and [Shimiao] reached out to wipe them away.
1:39:34|1:39:48|[Shifen] suddenly looked up and glanced at the clock beside her, quickly saying, "[Shifen], push [Shimiao] onto the table and turn on the virtual candle on the phone."
1:40:16|1:40:34|[Shimiao] blew out the candle, and the lights on the boat went out at the same time. Suddenly, a huge wheel-shaped moon appeared in the night sky, slowly passing through the city. Unable to find her brother, [Shimiao] fell into despair. The two of them had to ride the electric bike back the way they came, with [Shifen] trying to make [Shimiao] laugh along the way.
1:40:34|1:40:51|When passing over a speed bump, [Shifen] habitually reached out to hold onto [Shimiao] behind her. [Shimiao] looked up at [Shifen] with tears in her eyes, not knowing that [Shifen] was feeling the same. When they arrived at [Shimiao]'s home downstairs, she took off her helmet and handed it to [Shifen].
1:41:12|1:41:36|[Shimiao] twisted his arm, making [Shifen] wince in pain. [Shifen] opened his mouth wide, patted [Shimiao] with his other hand as a sign of surrender. [Shimiao] let go, placed the helmet on the back seat of the electric bike. [Shifen] nodded, while [Shimiao] still kept a distance. Faced with [Shifen]'s forced smile, [Shimiao] could only awkwardly smile back and quickly turned away.
1:41:38|1:41:56|She walked to the staircase, and the broken voice-activated light above suddenly lit up. Although she found it strange, she did not suspect anything and slowly walked up the stairs. Just as she took two steps, she seemed to remember something, turned around and looked at [Shifen]. [Shifen] was still standing in place, smiling foolishly. After a moment of thought, [Shimiao] said,
1:41:58|1:42:20|[Shifen] immediately nodded obediently, keeping a smile as she looked at [Shimiao]. After Shimiao finished speaking, she awkwardly turned around and ran up the stairs. The motion sensor lights on the second floor lit up accordingly. Shimiao suddenly stuck her head out, and Shifen also looked up at her. Shifen continued to smile and waved at Shimiao, who waved back reluctantly.
1:42:21|1:42:28|Shimiao returned home, but Uncle Hu suddenly appeared, and Mom walked over.
1:43:5|1:43:29|After turning on the light, [Shifen] found that her room had miraculously returned, but only the furniture remained, all the items were gone. Looking around, [Shimiao] saw the familiar bed and table, as well as the small sofa in front of the window. She looked up and saw the basketball net on the wall. Hurriedly opening the cabinet, she found that [Shifen]'s towel was also missing.
1:43:29|1:43:42|She then opened the wardrobe and found a small note stuck on the clothes rail. She moved aside the hangers and took the note down, which read, "My darling, I've taken everything with me, not leaving a single thing for you."
1:43:42|1:44:2|Shimiao then came to the bedside in the bedroom and found several large characters on the wall, saying "Cowards have to rely on themselves in the future," with a big arrow pointing to a rope at the end of it. There were also a few messages posted at the head of the bed, including "Stop at the red light" and "Eat less spicy food and more vegetables."
1:44:2|1:44:21|"Do not believe what boys say," "Violence cannot solve problems." There is a key to an electric bike on the table, and a card next to it reads: "Happy 17th Birthday, Sister." [Shimiao] picks up the rope, gently pulls it, and the light goes out. Pull it again and it lights up.
1:44:21|1:44:40|Shimiao repeated the action, her eyes gradually moistening, with the image of Shifen appearing in her mind. The scene shifted back to a moment ago, with Shifen standing by Shimiao's bed, everything prepared perfectly. She looked at her masterpiece with satisfaction, feeling that she could leave with peace of mind.
1:44:40|1:44:56|He lay on [Shimiao]'s bed, trying the modified pull switch he made himself. As the lights flickered on and off, time rewound to the present moment. [Shimiao] kept pulling the rope, tears shimmering in his eyes, his face filled with undisguised sorrow.
1:44:56|1:45:6|The scene cuts back to daytime, with [Shifen] standing on a ladder repairing the voice-activated lights in the hallway. After fixing it, he smiles with satisfaction and leaves contentedly.
1:45:6|1:45:33|[Shimiao] was immersed in memories and couldn't help but cry while pulling the light string. When the light turned on, [Shimiao] lowered her head, unable to control herself any longer. Tears slowly fell from the corner of her eyes, and then [Shimiao] couldn't hold back anymore. She turned around and ran out frantically. Seeing this, her mother hurriedly shouted, and [Shimiao] quickly rushed out of the room, closed the door, ran down the stairs, hopped on the electric bike, and left.
1:45:34|1:45:42|The scene shifts back to a month ago, the night when Mom and Uncle Hu brought [Shifen] to dinner.
1:46:24|1:46:32|Mom lowered her head and couldn't speak. Uncle Hu also adjusted his glasses. [Shifen] said firmly,
1:46:48|1:46:58|Uncle Hu's eyes were also red, patting Mom's back soothingly. At this moment, [Shimiao] was driving an electric car rapidly on the road.
1:47:54|1:48:16|[Miao Miaomiao] was driving on the road, tears uncontrollably streaming down her face. She had always thought that [Shifen] was petty, selfish, and heartless, only knowing how to tease her brother. It wasn't until she discovered the secret that [Shifen] had been hiding deep in his heart all along, and until [Shifen] disappeared from her life one after another, that [Shimiao] realized how good her brother really was.
1:48:16|1:48:23|In front of the dining table, [Shifen] paused for a moment, then continued,
1:48:25|1:48:39|[Shifen] kept staring at her mother with a silly smile after speaking, tears shimmering in her eyes. Her mother felt extremely guilty, lowered her head, covered her mouth with her hand, and tears streamed down her face.
1:49:4|1:49:31|Shimiao pointed at the passing electric car and asked her brother, then the two ran hand in hand on the steps, opening their arms and laughing happily. The scene at that moment was so beautiful, even the strands of hair dancing in the air carried joy. Sunlight spilled on the pillars in the living room, where the siblings' growth was recorded with chalk. Finally, Shimiao arrived at the train station. Even in the late night, it was still bustling with people.
1:49:31|1:49:36|Shimiao parked the electric bike next to the stall at the entrance and ran towards the lobby.
1:49:41|1:49:58|Shimiao arrived at the platform, running while looking for Shifen's figure. The platform was crowded with passengers carrying bags of all sizes, waiting for the approaching train. A train passed in front of Shimiao, and then she saw Shifen on the other side of the tracks.
1:49:59|1:50:21|[Shimiao] excitedly shouted, while [Shifen] was packing her luggage with her back towards her. He couldn't believe his ears, slowly turned his head, and looked at [Shimiao] in shock. [Shimiao] shouted again, and [Shifen] turned around to look at the several large bags behind her, but found nothing unusual. She then turned around, took off the backpack behind her, and said,
1:50:33|1:50:55|[Shimiao] cried out, tears streaming down her face, while [Shifen] stood frozen in place, his mouth twitching. The siblings locked eyes, conveying their reluctance through silent tears. [Shifen]'s tears fell like beads off a broken string, continuously dropping. After a long while, he slowly lowered his raised arm, unable to speak through his sobs.
1:50:55|1:51:11|He wanted to face Shimiao as usual with a happy expression, tears streaming down his face as he grinned widely. At that moment, the clock next to the station chimed, reminding everyone that the train was about to arrive. Shimiao looked up and realized that it was almost midnight.
1:51:11|1:51:26|She suddenly realized, hurriedly took out her phone, opened the virtual candle, solemnly made a wish, [Shimiao] stared at [Shifen] opposite, shed a tear, and finally blew out the candle when the clock struck.
1:51:26|1:51:42|The film is about to say goodbye to you here. Thank you for listening. The end of the film will bring you a post-credits scene.
1:52:16|1:52:34|In this post-credits scene, two mall employees are lying in a pile of snacks. One of them remarks that the nearby monster plush toy is also joining in, indicating that it should also get a share.
