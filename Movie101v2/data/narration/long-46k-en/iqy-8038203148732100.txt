0:2:22|0:2:43|This is a rural area in North China. In the distance is a mountain with several houses at the foot of it. Nearby is a lake with very clear water. Looking down from a high place, the mountains stretch continuously across North China. Below the mountains are vast fertile fields, with flat terrain and dense trees.
0:2:45|0:3:1|We now see a river with trees on both banks, and in the distance, a person is carrying something and walking slowly. We are now on a hillside with dozens of sheep, among them an old shepherd.
0:3:21|0:3:28|The millet in the valley below is growing very well, with full and heavy ears swaying in the wind.
0:3:50|0:3:52|The fertile land stretches as far as the eye can see.
0:4:32|0:4:51|Yang Bailao stood up straight from the millet field, wiping his face with the cloth on his head. His daughter [Xi'er] lifted her head and wiped the sweat off her forehead. Yang Bailao pushed aside the millet and walked towards [Xi'er], saying to her.
0:5:1|0:5:23|[Xi'er] took the handkerchief handed by her father and wiped the sweat off her face. She tossed her braid back and continued to cut the bones with her head down. [Auntie Wang] came with food, meeting familiar neighbors on the way.
0:5:26|0:5:52|Auntie Wang looked towards the field and saw her son, Da Chun, still working. She placed the meal in the shade under a tree, wiped her hands with her clothes, and shouted towards the millet field, "Chun, Chun, my son." With some effort, Auntie Wang climbed up the field ridge and walked up to Da Chun to speak.
0:5:59|0:6:3|Da Chun wiped the sweat off his forehead and shouted to Xi'er in the distance.
0:6:11|0:6:23|Yang Bailao and his daughter [Xi'er] walked towards the tree, while Wang Dachun carried the food to the tree. [Xi'er] bent down to help Auntie Wang scoop the rice.
0:6:43|0:6:47|Auntie Wang saw Xi'er's hand and said with a heartache.
0:7:2|0:7:10|[Xi'er] buried her head in embarrassment and continued eating. Suddenly, they heard a cough, and the four people eating looked towards Uncle Zhao coming down the hill.
0:7:27|0:7:55|Uncle Zhao waved the whip, walked down the hill, and stood up with a bowl of rice soup. [Auntie Wang] squinted her eyes, threaded a needle, trying to mend clothes but couldn't get them through.
0:8:3|0:8:13|Auntie Wang touched Xi'er's hair, her eyes full of love. Zhao Dashu and Yang Bailao sat on the side smoking sweat tobacco.
0:8:37|0:8:41|[Da Chun] and [Xi'er] met at a glance, and then shyly ran away.
0:9:23|0:9:42|[Xi'er] was sewing clothes under a tree, while [Da Chun] watched him with a smile. Listening to the elders' chat, the two were both happy and shy. [Da Chun] took the clothes handed by [Xi'er] and ran to the millet field. [Xi'er] got up and chased after him, and the two of them together harvested millet in the field.
0:9:54|0:10:1|[Xi'er] looked up and smiled at [Da Chun], who also smiled back at [Xi'er]. The two of them looked very sweet together.
0:10:5|0:10:30|The millet in the field is ripe, each stalk bending with heavy grains, promising a good harvest this year. As the camera zooms out, we can see the clear and crisp autumn weather, with dozens of sheep happily grazing on the hillside, their movements flowing like water.
0:10:31|0:10:56|The scene shifts to the road, where a royal carriage comes racing by. In front of the carriage is a coachman cracking a whip and shouting, followed by several attendants. The electric farmers are struggling to move forward on the road with heavy bones on their backs. The coachman shouts loudly from behind, and upon hearing the shout, [Xi'er] turns her head.
0:10:58|0:11:13|[Huang Shiren] saw [Xi'er] smiling happily while waving a fan, but [Xi'er] turned and walked away unhappily.
0:11:28|0:11:48|[Xi'er] stopped in her tracks and turned around when she heard these words, while [Da Chun] behind her gritted his teeth and cursed under his breath. Huang Shiren sat comfortably in the carriage, fanning himself leisurely as the carriage raced along the narrow path among the ancient fields. When the royal person arrived at the doorstep, a plaque with the words "De Guan Qian Qing" hung above.
0:12:7|0:12:16|The scene shifts, and we see [Auntie Wang], the mother of the royal family, sitting at the table knocking on a wooden fish. The table is full of offerings, and there is a little maid next to her fanning her.
0:12:26|0:12:33|The old lady wrapped the rosary around her hand, with the help of the little maid, slowly walked to the kang in the outer room and sat down.
0:12:57|0:13:3|[Huang Shiren] sat on the kang, and Mu Renzhi came in to greet him.
0:13:28|0:13:39|[Huang Shiren] stood up. Auntie Wang stood up and walked into the room, while [Mu Renzhi] looked at [Huang Shiren] with the account book in hand.
0:14:5|0:14:23|The old lady started knocking the wooden fish again. The copper gong rang on the drum stand in the shop. Upon hearing this, the laborers working in the shop put down their tools.
0:14:27|0:14:37|Surprised and saddened, [Xi'er] carefully sun-dries the bones of her family with her father Yang Bailao while wearing a headscarf. The scene shifts, with [Huang Shiren] pointing at the account book.
0:14:52|0:15:19|[Huang Shiren] narrowed his eyes, threw the account book heavily onto the table, sat down and started fanning himself. Upon hearing these words, Huang Shiren stopped fanning, nodded his head. On the stage, Yang Bailao poured grains into a bag with a bamboo sieve, while [Xi'er] held the bag, looking at her father with a worried expression.
0:15:33|0:15:47|Yang Bailao took the bag, and [Xi'er] helped her father lift the grain onto his shoulders. At the rent collection site, Uncle Wu sat on the ground slowly rubbing bone seeds, wiping tears as he did so.
0:15:49|0:16:15|Next to the rent collector, a person sat on a chair leisurely drinking tea, smiling as they watched the shopkeepers pay their rent. Yang Bailao came over with [Xi'er], and someone told him that Uncle Wu had poured all the leftover melon seeds into the rent collection box, but it still wasn't enough.
0:17:30|0:17:34|Mu Renzhi turned his head and looked at [Xi'er].
0:18:4|0:18:12|In a run-down house, Yang Bailao sat on the kang smoking a cigarette, the wrinkles on his forehead clearly visible.
0:18:16|0:18:25|[Xi'er] sat on a small stool next to her father, looked at him and said, suddenly a woman's loud crying could be heard from outside.
0:18:44|0:19:11|[Xi'er] opened the door and walked out, with Auntie Wang following behind. On the way, they ran into Da Chun's family and Big Brother Suo. The camera then focused on Yang Bailao's face, and we could see that he was completely stunned.
0:19:12|0:19:38|In the distant wild field, [Auntie Wang] was burning paper and crying. Yang Bailao, shocked by the scene, slowly regained his composure and walked to the front of the house. He lit a cigarette and fell into contemplation, with [Auntie Wang] following him to offer comfort.
0:20:8|0:20:16|[Da Chun] wrapped the rope around himself in circles, securing it tightly. Prepared, he held his tools and spoke to [Xi'er].
0:20:19|0:20:38|On the steep cliff, [Da Chun] successfully descended using ropes and tools. He searched for suitable miscellaneous trees on the cliff, hooked himself to the tree, and then took out the machete from his waist to cut down the tree. It was not easy to cut trees in such a dangerous place.
0:20:38|0:20:45|On one hand, Da Chun's only safety guarantee is a hemp rope, and accidents could easily happen if he's not careful.
0:20:46|0:21:7|On the other hand, [Da Chun] was dangling in the air, making it even more difficult to control the direction, requiring several attempts to successfully hook onto the miscellaneous tree. [Xi'er] crouched on the grass below, holding the rope, her expression tense with worry for [Da Chun]'s safety.
0:21:7|0:21:12|Winter arrived in the blink of an eye, and the distant mountains were covered with a thick layer of snow.
0:21:15|0:21:36|[Xi'er] and [Da Chun] are resting on the snowy ground. The firewood is too heavy, and [Xi'er] can't get up. [Da Chun] helps lift the firewood onto his shoulders and carries a bag of firewood back home. Under the oil lamp, [Xi'er]'s father [Yang Bailao] is counting money.
0:21:52|0:21:55|Uncle Zhao and Brother Da Suo are busy in the room.
0:22:4|0:22:8|A kitten trying to steal brine was caught by the scruff of its neck.
0:23:17|0:23:23|Yang Bailao walked on the street, carefully putting away the money. Suddenly, he saw a red cotton-padded jacket.
0:23:33|0:24:0|Yang Bailao dared not speak, nor did he dare to look at that red cotton jacket. [Da Chun] carried a shoulder pole and walked through the bustling crowd, approaching. In front of a stall selling head ornaments, he met Yang Bailao who was buying a red head rope for [Xi'er]. He took out money from his clothes and said to Yang Bailao.
0:24:10|0:24:30|Yang Bailao took the money handed over by [Da Chun] and walked forward happily. [Da Chun] followed behind, and when they reached the market gate, Yang Bailao said to [Da Chun]. [Da Chun] took Yang Bailao's bundle and carried it on his back.
0:24:30|0:24:46|[Da Chun] suddenly saw a vendor selling banyan flowers nearby. He happily walked over and picked two nice ones. At [Xi'er]'s home, [Xi'er] was cutting paper.
0:25:54|0:26:3|[Da Chun] walked into the room and placed the red headband and velvet flower in front of [Xi'er]. Upon seeing these items, [Xi'er] was both surprised and shy.
0:26:5|0:26:26|Da Chun walked out with a smile. A thick layer of snow had accumulated on the ground, and it was still snowing in the sky. Yang Bailao stood at the gate of the royal courtyard, brushing off the snow on his body before going in. On the other side, Xi'er was combing her hair.
0:27:9|0:27:15|[Xi'er] looked at herself in the mirror, feeling delighted, and shyly covered her face with her hands.
0:27:21|0:27:30|Yang Bailao was brought in front of the royal family. He took out a small money pouch from his pocket and placed the money on the table.
0:28:21|0:28:24|[Huang Shiren] stood up from the chair and spoke.
0:28:45|0:28:54|Old Mu, [Huang Shiren] turned and walked away, Mu Renzhi said to Yang Bailao.
0:29:8|0:29:17|Yang Bailao never expected them to say that. He was stunned. Yang Bailao knelt on the ground, hugging [Huang Shiren]'s legs.
0:30:13|0:30:15|Yang Bailao knelt in front of [Huang Shiren].
0:30:25|0:30:39|[Huang Shiren] kicked Yang Bailao away. Yang Bailao knelt on the ground, tears filling his eyes. Mu Renzhi forcefully moved Yang Bailao's fingers, forcing him to press his fingerprint on the document selling his daughter.
0:30:43|0:30:46|Auntie Wang came to Xi'er's house and shouted from outside the window.
0:30:50|0:31:8|[Xi'er] quickly took off the cotton flower on her head, let down her braids, put away everything, and happily ran to open the door. [Auntie Wang] and [Da Chun] walked into the room. At the entrance of the royal gate, [Huang Shiren] kept knocking on the door.
0:31:23|0:31:27|On the other side, Auntie Wang, Da Chun, and Xi'er are making dumplings.
0:31:38|0:32:4|Xi'er ran to the door and helped her father brush off the snow on his body. Xi'er supported her father, Yang Bailao, to sit down, and used her right hand to stir the charcoal fire in the stove. Auntie Wang asked with concern on the side. Tears filled Yang Bailao's eyes. Zhao Dashu said happily.
0:32:45|0:32:55|Yang Bailao licked the ink on his right index finger, rubbing it back and forth on his knee, trying to clean his finger.
0:33:6|0:33:32|Yang Bailao wiped the tears from his face and walked slowly into the room. Taking the wine brought by Uncle Zhao, Yang Bailao turned his back and finished it in one gulp. Xi'er handed him a bowl of rice. Yang Bailao took the bowl and sat gently by the kang.
0:34:16|0:34:25|In the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, when [Zhao Shu] graduated from the Pei Du family, he really couldn't survive.
0:35:48|0:35:53|Uncle Zhao put down his bowl, put on his coat, and walked to the door.
0:36:3|0:36:21|Uncle Zhao, Auntie Wang, and Da Chun have all gone back. Xi'er closed the door, with heavy snow falling outside and the wind blowing fiercely. Yang Bailao sat by the fire, while Xi'er sat on the heated brick bed.
0:36:30|0:36:54|[Xi'er] took a box from the heated brick bed and sat down next to her father Yang Bailao. She took out a flower from the box, imagining how it would look on her head, and shyly lowered her head. Looking at her father, [Xi'er] happily leaned against him. Yang Bailao gently stroked his daughter's hair.
0:36:55|0:37:19|Meanwhile, Auntie Wang is packing clothes for her son Da Chun. She looks at her sleeping son and can't help but smile. The scene shifts back to Xi'er's home, where Yang Bailao gently strokes Xi'er's face and speaks to him.
0:37:31|0:37:37|Yang Bailao made the kang bed and said to [Xi'er].
0:37:44|0:37:48|Yang Bailao helped [Xi'er] tuck in the quilt, and [Xi'er] mumbled sleepily.
0:37:56|0:38:8|Yang Bailao looked up, and we saw in the darkness, only his eyes were shining, filled with tears.
0:39:47|0:40:7|Yang Bailao rushed to the door and opened it. In the swirling snow, he seemed to see the royal family again. Yang Bailao turned around, helplessly closed the door, and sat dejectedly by the wall. At that moment, he suddenly saw someone on the wall.
0:40:10|0:40:29|Yang Bailao took a few steps towards the brine, then slowly turned around and saw his daughter, Xi'er, sleeping soundly. Her hand was reaching out as if searching for something. Yang Bailao bent down, looking at the pot of brine, hesitating.
0:40:37|0:40:58|The camera zooms in, revealing the dense wrinkles and crisscrossed tear marks on Yang Bailao's face. He stares blankly ahead, his eyes filled with despair. Suddenly, Yang Bailao picks up the jar of brine and tilts his head back, gulping it down.
0:40:58|0:41:6|Due to drinking too quickly, some brine dripped from the corner of Xi'er's mouth, and the brine jar fell to the ground, shattering.
0:41:11|0:41:36|Yang Bailao slowly untied his belt and took off his cotton-padded jacket, gently covering Xi'er with it. The toxicity of the brine began to take effect, Yang Bailao clutched his stomach in pain, struggling to walk towards the door. By the time he reached the door, he could no longer stand steadily.
0:41:38|0:42:5|Yang Bailao, with tears in his eyes, took one last look at his daughter and disappeared outside the door. As the day broke, [Yang Bailao] lay in the snow, covered with a thin layer of snow. [Xi'er], [Auntie Wang], Uncle Zhao, and the villagers found [Yang Bailao] lying in the snow.
0:42:59|0:43:28|[Auntie Wang] pulled the crying [Xi'er]. [Auntie Wang] pulled the crying [Xi'er]. [Huang Shiren]'s steward [Mu Renzhi] walked over, [Huang Shiren]'s steward [Mu Renzhi] walked over.
0:43:44|0:43:58|The villagers pushed [Da Chun] aside. [Da Chun] took out a piece of paper from his pocket and unfolded it in front of everyone.
0:44:12|0:44:17|Li Chun took the document and looked at the neighbors, then read aloud.
0:44:36|0:44:41|The villagers looked at each other, [Xi'er] knelt on the ground, sobbing uncontrollably.
0:45:34|0:45:39|An elderly person walked to the front from the crowd.
0:46:28|0:46:45|Mu Renzhi went up to take Xi'er away, but the villagers pushed him aside. However, Mu Renzhi's henchman pulled out a gun and stared fiercely at everyone. Uncle Zhao said angrily.
0:47:3|0:47:9|Auntie Wang helped Xi'er put on the snow-white scarf, and Xi'er was speechless with anger.
0:47:19|0:47:43|Xi'er's face was also full of tears. He suddenly knelt down, threw himself on his father, and cried loudly. The royal servants came over, grabbed Xi'er's shoulders, and took him away. Xi'er cried and struggled, but his resistance was futile.
0:47:46|0:48:10|The servants rudely took off the headscarf on [Xi'er]'s head and threw it on the ground. [Xi'er] was dragged all the way to the royal palace crying and shouting. A little maid from the palace came to deliver a message to Auntie Wang. Mu Renzhi walked over with some beautiful clothes.
0:48:19|0:48:36|Auntie Zhang walked into the room anxiously, putting on a respectful expression. Auntie Zhang led [Xi'er] away, while Huang Shiren watched [Xi'er] walk away with gritted teeth.
0:48:39|0:48:50|The old lady glared viciously at [Xi'er], who kept crying with her back turned and did not answer the question.
0:49:14|0:49:35|Hearing this, [Huang Shiren] rushed in from outside. The old lady completely ignored [Huang Shiren]. Watching Auntie Zhang take the girl she had snatched away, [Xi'er] was anxious and helpless, not daring to confront her mother's [Huang Shiren]. In the room, Auntie Zhang asked [Xi'er] with concern.
0:49:40|0:50:1|[Xi'er] looked up in a daze. [Xi'er] remembered something and stopped crying with her head down.
0:50:7|0:50:12|[Xi'er] turned to look at Auntie Zhang, who was patting her back and saying.
0:50:29|0:50:35|Xi'er seemed to see hope landing in Auntie Wang's arms, tightly holding onto her sleeve.
0:50:47|0:50:50|[Xi'er] cried and said to [Auntie Wang].
0:51:6|0:51:26|The sun in the west gradually set behind the clouds. [Auntie Wang], carrying a hoe, sat alone on the ridge, looking ahead.
0:51:59|0:52:8|However, in the royal palace unseen by Da Chun, Xi'er is suffering.
0:52:44|0:52:53|During the day, [Xi'er] was reprimanded by the royal family, and at night, the bullied [Xi'er] sat alone under the eaves.
0:53:36|0:53:44|The round moon shines on the high roof, [Xi'er] is sewing under the dim oil lamp.
0:54:37|0:54:51|[Xi'er] buried her head and carefully worked on repairing Da Chun's shoes. Suddenly, Huang Shiren pushed open the door and walked towards Xi'er with a piece of cloth in his hand, a malicious smile on his face.
0:54:57|0:55:0|[Huang Shiren] held [Xi'er]'s hand and looked at the shoes.
0:55:6|0:55:31|[Xi'er] hurriedly left the house with her shoes, while [Huang Shiren] stood at the door gritting his teeth. Mu Renzhi walked over, and [Huang Shiren] whispered something in his ear before the scene transitioned. [Auntie Wang] stood by the well, sighing.
0:55:38|0:55:44|Mu Renzhi brought a few followers, holding hoes, wantonly destroying Da Chun's home.
0:55:49|0:55:53|Auntie Wang is very anxious to see her own grain being wasted.
0:56:14|0:56:34|[Da Chun] stared at Mu Renzhi with a mix of anxiety and anger. The scene then shifted to [Xi'er] adding oil to the bamboo platform in the Buddha hall. Outside the house, [Huang Shiren] peeked sneakily with a handkerchief in hand.
0:56:44|0:57:4|[Xi'er] had just placed the bamboo table on the table when the royal person rudely grabbed her from behind. But Auntie Zhang couldn't hear her cries for help, as the royal person smirked and covered [Xi'er]'s mouth with a handkerchief.
0:57:5|0:57:29|The plaque hanging in the Buddha hall reads "Great Compassion and Accumulation of Goodness Hall". The wind outside is blowing strongly, and [Auntie Wang] suddenly wakes up. She sees the bed next to her is empty, and immediately gets up to walk outside. [Xi'er] has a cloth stuffed in her mouth, lying on the ground in the Buddha hall unable to move.
0:57:29|0:57:33|Auntie Wang pushed open the door and saw Xi'er in such a miserable state.
0:57:38|0:57:48|Auntie Wang helped Xi'er untie her bound hands. Xi'er, however, rushed towards the door motionlessly.
0:57:57|0:57:59|Xi'er kneels down to Auntie Wang.
0:58:25|0:58:32|[Xi'er] turned her head with tears in her eyes and saw the pair of shoes she had carefully sewn on the table.
0:58:37|0:59:4|She picked up the shoes and held them tightly in her hands. [Xi'er] did not respond, just lowered her head and continued sewing the shoes. Auntie Zhang asked a little maid to watch over [Xi'er], and she went to find [Da Chun].
0:59:20|0:59:35|Everyone in the room sighed, and suddenly the door opened as Auntie Zhang walked in. Uncle Zhao walked out with a pipe and tobacco pouch.
0:59:39|0:59:51|Da Chun and Auntie Wang were both anxious. After a while, Uncle Zhao returned to the room first, glanced at Auntie Wang, and remained silent.
1:0:12|1:0:35|Uncle Zhao finished speaking, lowered his head heavily, [Da Chun] took a deep breath, grabbed the axe and wanted to go out, but was stopped by everyone. Auntie Wang couldn't help but cry, she had already treated [Xi'er] as her own daughter. [Da Chun] sat down slowly, then Auntie Zhang continued speaking.
1:0:56|1:1:2|Uncle Zhao pondered for a moment, made up his mind decisively, and slammed his leg heavily.
1:1:23|1:1:33|Auntie Zhang told Xi'er about the elopement plan, Da Chun took off his padded jacket and handed it to Dasuo, then quietly opened the door and walked into the royal courtyard.
1:1:38|1:1:43|Auntie Zhang lovingly patted Xi'er's hair. Upon seeing Xi'er, Da Chun immediately grabbed his hand.
1:1:47|1:2:8|Quick, quick, quick, Da Chun and [Xi'er] hurriedly ran out.
1:2:8|1:2:28|Xi'er was blocked at the door. She was caught by the royal servants, and struggled with them. Da Chun punched a royal servant in the face, broke free from the entanglement, and seized the opportunity to run outside.
1:2:31|1:2:51|The shepherd shouted loudly, and Da Chun climbed down from the courtyard wall, escaping from the royal palace. He met Uncle Zhao and [Auntie Wang] who were waiting outside. [Auntie Wang] looked at the gradually thinning Da Chun and tightly held her son's hand.
1:2:56|1:3:22|Auntie Wang cried in pain leaning on Da Chun, Zhao Dashu said to Da Chun. Da Chun gritted his teeth and left his hometown without looking back. Cut to Xi'er dragging her weak body pushing the millstone, a concubine stumbled.
1:3:25|1:3:54|[Xi'er] supported the millstone and slowly straightened up. [Xi'er] had a pale face and a weak body. On the other side, [Da Chun] who left home alone, walked barefoot in the water. Leaning on a wooden stick, he crawled up the steep hillside, searching for direction.
1:4:16|1:4:27|[Xi'er] weakly lowered her head and continued to grind the mill. Auntie Zhang secretly brought a bowl of rice to him, walking cautiously to avoid being caught.
1:4:35|1:4:56|[Da Chun] used both hands and feet to move forward on the steep mountain. Finally, [Da Chun] arrived at the bank of the Yellow River. The Yellow River was very wide, with turbulent waves, very dangerous. [Da Chun] could only go with the flow on the river. [Da Chun] was deeply moved.
1:4:59|1:5:8|He wanted to find someone to help, and by the river, [Da Chun] found an old man.
1:5:45|1:5:52|Da Chun and the old man made a simple sheepskin boat, and the two of them lay on top paddling desperately.
1:5:57|1:6:9|As the sun was about to set, they finally arrived safely on the other side of the Yellow River.
1:6:22|1:6:48|On a high mountain ridge, two Red Army soldiers are on guard duty. The slope is covered with various trees and grass. A ragged young man is climbing up the hill using both hands and feet. The Red Army soldiers soon spot him. When the young man is about to reach the mountaintop, they both reach out their hands and pull him up.
1:6:50|1:6:57|The young man's clothes were tattered. After seeing this, the Red Army soldier felt uneasy.
1:7:9|1:7:17|The bright red party flag fluttered in the wind. Before long, Da Chun also became a proud soldier of the Red Army.
1:7:18|1:7:38|This is a royal wedding ceremony, with decorations everywhere, grand and magnificent. The doors are embroidered with large characters of "happiness". Well-dressed guests enter one after another, chatting loudly in the living room. Servants shuttle back and forth, carrying various gifts and delicious dishes.
1:7:46|1:8:8|The royal family members wore a big red flower on their chests and a groom's hat on their heads, smiling and thanking the guests with folded hands. [Xi'er] sat alone in a dark room, quietly working while listening to the lively noises outside. Suddenly, the butler [Mu Renzhi] opened the door and entered. [Xi'er] turned her head.
1:8:8|1:8:11|Xi'er hesitated to go, while Mu Renzhi urged her on.
1:8:20|1:8:34|[Xi'er] tossed her braid behind her and walked out listlessly. She was brought before the old lady, who put down her cigarette holder.
1:8:57|1:9:10|[Xi'er] did not take the clothes and walked out of the door angrily, completely ignoring the royal person who had just arrived. Auntie Zhang, who was passing by, stopped in her tracks. The old lady put away her smiling face from earlier and said angrily.
1:9:29|1:9:44|[Xi'er] ran back to her room, secretly packed a bundle, and sat by the kang holding it. Auntie Zhang eavesdropped outside the door and overheard the conversation between the old lady and [Mu Renzhi], learning that they were about to sell [Xi'er] off, feeling extremely anxious.
1:9:51|1:10:6|Auntie Zhang quickly stole the key to the storeroom and ran to find [Xi'er]. When [Xi'er] saw Auntie Zhang coming back, she hurried to greet her.
1:10:16|1:10:30|Upon hearing Auntie Zhang's words, [Xi'er] was first surprised, then extremely angry. She never expected the royal family to do such outrageous things behind the scenes. She wanted to rush out, but was stopped by Auntie Zhang.
1:10:45|1:10:56|At this moment, [Huang Shiren] and his followers were waiting to capture someone with sacks and ropes in hand. [Huang Shiren] opened a handkerchief, inside were several silver dollars.
1:11:20|1:11:31|[Xi'er] quietly used the key to unlock the door. After opening it, she didn't know which way to go.
1:11:53|1:12:22|[Xi'er] ran out of the palace with a burden on his back. Looking back, he saw the palace guards with lanterns catching up from not far behind. He turned and ran. The royal servants carried lanterns, held wooden sticks, and carried guns, relentlessly chasing after him. [Xi'er] ran to the riverbank, finding himself with nowhere to go.
1:12:24|1:12:38|Xi'er took off her shoes and hid in the reeds by the river. The royal servants carried lanterns, searching along the riverbank.
1:13:0|1:13:18|[Huang Shiren] took the shoes and upon seeing them, [Xi'er] heard [Huang Shiren] say this.
1:13:24|1:13:43|The royal entourage finally left the riverside, and [Xi'er] quickly emerged from the reeds. He climbed up the mountain, looking towards the direction of the palace, brightly lit and magnificent, filled with resentment.
1:14:43|1:14:51|[Xi'er] ran up the mountain, looking for a place to stay, she ran for a long, long time.
1:15:2|1:15:23|Xi'er was so exhausted that she could barely walk, so she had to crawl slowly along the road. She lifted her head and saw a cave on a distant barren hill, thinking of seeking refuge there.
1:15:27|1:15:49|Xi'er finally arrived at the entrance of the cave after walking for who knows how long. He walked into the cave, taking one step at a time, leaning against the rock wall. Xi'er lay down on a large rock.
1:15:51|1:16:18|He looked fearfully into the cave. The cave was pitch black, with water droplets constantly falling from the cracks in the ceiling, and there were puddles of varying depths on the ground. [Xi'er] gingerly made her way deeper into the cave, stepping through mud and water, while supporting herself on the oddly shaped rocks.
1:16:19|1:16:39|He wanted to hide, to a place where the royal family couldn't find him. In the cave, it was spacious and quiet. No matter what noise there was, [Xi'er] was very scared.
1:16:52|1:17:14|Suddenly, a small animal darted out from behind the rock. [Xi'er] was so scared that she kept backing away, accidentally stepping into the puddle next to her, then quickly climbing up the rock behind her. She weakly lay on the rock, her face already blurred with a mix of tears and sweat.
1:17:17|1:17:39|[Xi'er] slowly stood up, drenched in the pouring rain, and walked back to the cave. Before long, winter arrived, the grass and trees withered, the wind howled, and heavy snow fell. [Xi'er]'s clothes were already thin, now they were even more tattered.
1:17:41|1:17:56|[Xi'er] had no clothing to prevent the cold, nor fire to warm herself. She could only cover her freezing body with some leaves and grass.
1:19:19|1:19:37|[Xi'er] hung her head in pain, then suddenly lifted it up again. The tears on her face had frozen into ice beads. [Xi'er] remembered there was a grandma temple at the foot of the mountain. Although the temple was dilapidated, there were always some offerings. By eating them, she could survive and seek revenge.
1:20:2|1:20:15|Disheveled [Xi'er] struggled to push aside the snow at the entrance of the cave, walking through the snow with difficulty. Finally, at night, [Xi'er] arrived in front of her grandmother.
1:20:32|1:20:40|There are two incense burners lying on the ground, covered with thick snow, looking like they haven't been used for a long time.
1:20:45|1:21:2|Smoke was rising in the innermost room. [Xi'er] walked over. The room was very dilapidated, with the paper on the doors and windows almost falling off, covered with layers of cobwebs.
1:21:26|1:21:34|Fortunately, there were still some offerings on the table, and the incense in the censer had not been extinguished.
1:21:54|1:22:16|[Xi'er] picked up the incense stick, carefully protecting the flame all the way back to the cold cave. With the fire, [Xi'er] could finally keep warm.
1:22:24|1:22:41|The raging fire illuminated Xi'er's emaciated face. He swung his homemade axe, chopping firewood and making the fire burn brightly.
1:22:57|1:23:12|In spring, the snow melts, the snow water gathers into streams, rivers, and eventually becomes a surging river. The weather is clear, and the flowers are in full bloom.
1:23:17|1:23:41|People saw that the offerings placed in the Grandma Temple were missing, thinking that it was the work of the gods. They then came to the temple one after another, offering incense and paper money in the outer hall, filling the inner hall with offerings in front of the deity statues, lighting incense in the censers, and respectfully bowing on the ground, praying for the blessings of the gods.
1:23:56|1:24:0|A group of people surrounded an old man holding a cigarette gun, asking curiously.
1:26:38|1:26:54|The people listening to the story around them felt both curious and scared, not knowing what was going on. Since then, the incense in the temple became more and more prosperous, and those who visited the White-Haired Immortal to seek blessings could kneel from the main hall to the front door.
1:27:2|1:27:12|We see Xi'er climbing a steep cliff, searching for something to eat. By now, her hair has turned completely white.
1:27:14|1:27:59|[Xi'er] had nothing to eat, so he had to search bird nests, catch animals, gather wild fruits, and sometimes go to his grandmother's temple to get offerings to sustain his life. In the cave, there was a fire pit, and [Xi'er] sat beside it, his face as pale as his long white hair. Dark clouds covered the sky, while the Japanese invasion was happening on the ground.
1:27:59|1:28:9|The Marco Polo Bridge Incident broke out in Japan, and shells landed in the valley, causing people working there to panic and flee.
1:28:17|1:28:42|Thanks to the Eighth Route Army, they bravely repelled the invaders and achieved victory. Da Chun fought in the Eighth Route Army. He was brave and fearless, even when injured, he fought at the forefront.
1:28:50|1:29:19|On a night of pouring rain, Xi'er and Huang Shiren ran to the gate of Grandma's Temple, their umbrellas blown away by the strong wind. They ran into the inner hall to take shelter from the rain.
1:29:26|1:29:53|Outside the temple, the wind and rain were raging, and inside, it was dark and eerie, looking very terrifying. Suddenly, with thunder roaring outside and lightning flashing, two people knelt in fear on the ground, and the white-haired Xi'er burst in from outside.
1:30:18|1:30:29|[Huang Shiren] was scared out of his wits, running ahead. In order not to be caught up by [Xi'er], he rolled down the hill. [Xi'er] looked down the mountain, saying angrily.
1:30:48|1:30:57|In the pond is the Palace Street of Xi'er, the wild valley on the mountain.
1:31:27|1:31:33|In the pouring rain, [Xi'er] with white hair all over her head, ran back to the cave.
1:31:37|1:31:59|On the river bank across, a person is riding a white horse, while a farmer on this side is cutting grass. Upon seeing the distant army, he drops the grass and runs away in fear. The person on the other side rides the white horse and chases after him.
1:32:4|1:32:12|The person riding the horse turned out to be soldier [Da Chun], who saw the old man herding sheep in the distance muttering to himself.
1:33:9|1:33:16|Auntie Wang looks at her son in military uniform.
1:33:48|1:33:54|Auntie Wang started crying while holding her son.
1:34:7|1:34:11|Auntie Wang gently placed her hand on her son's face.
1:34:46|1:35:0|The villagers warmly welcome the Eighth Route Army, offering them water and continuously stuffing dry rations into their pockets.
1:35:3|1:35:6|In [Huang Shiren]'s house, Mu Renzhi suddenly rushes in.
1:35:26|1:35:29|[Huang Shiren] and Mu Renzhi secretly hid to watch.
1:36:4|1:36:6|Auntie Wang walked into the room at this moment.
1:36:15|1:36:28|Auntie Wang opened the bundle in her arms and took out a pair of shoes made by Xi'er, placing them in Auntie Wang's hands.
1:36:43|1:36:46|For a moment, everyone fell into silence.
1:37:36|1:37:42|[Huang Shiren] nodded, took out a handkerchief from his sleeve, and wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and face.
1:37:45|1:37:53|[Huang Shiren] stood up from the chair, hands tucked into his sleeves, looking timid. He greeted softly.
1:38:3|1:38:30|While everyone was busy putting out the fire, no one noticed that [Mu Renzhi] had posted a talisman on the tree. The house burned down, and [Da Chun] sat angrily on the ground. Everyone saw the talisman.
1:38:58|1:39:23|In the middle of the night, Da Chun and Auntie Wang hide in a corner of the grandma's temple, waiting for the appearance of the White-Haired Fairy. Auntie Wang can't wait and wants to go out to take a look, but Da Chun holds her back.
1:39:26|1:39:55|Soon, a tall figure appeared at the door, it was [Xi'er] with white hair. As usual, she made sure no one was watching before rushing to the altar. She stood on the altar to take offerings. [Da Chun] jumped out and swung his knife, causing [Xi'er] to flee in panic from the Grandma Temple.
1:40:0|1:40:20|[Da Suo] and [Da Chun] are holding torches and chasing with long knives from behind. [Da Chun] fires a few shots from a distance. [Xi'er] is frightened and runs even faster.
1:40:27|1:40:32|Da Chun and Da Suo ran to the foot of the cliff, looked up, and saw Xi'er had already climbed to the edge of the cave on the mountaintop.
1:40:55|1:41:24|[Da Chun] and Da Suo followed [Xi'er] to the entrance of the cave, holding torches as they walked in. Inside the cave, dark and cold, [Xi'er] curled up in a pile of leaves.
1:41:43|1:41:51|To avoid the search by Da Chun and Dasuo, Xi'er hid in a dark corner above a cave.
1:42:4|1:42:18|Da Chun and Da Suo walked to the place where Xi'er had just avoided, and found an unburned bonfire on the ground.
1:42:27|1:42:30|Upon hearing the sound, [Da Chun] and Auntie Wang both looked up to search.
1:42:37|1:42:58|[Xi'er] peeked out from the corner with tears in her eyes. [Da Chun] took the torch and walked towards the direction of the sound. The firelight illuminated [Xi'er]'s face, which had once been youthful and beautiful, now looking incredibly weathered.
1:43:3|1:43:26|[Da Chun] approached with a torch and saw the person he had been thinking about day and night. [Xi'er] cried out in tears. Overwhelmed with emotion, [Xi'er] fainted. [Da Chun] quickly held him in his arms, calling out his name repeatedly.
1:43:33|1:43:39|[Xi'er] woke up and, weakly, looked at [Da Chun] with tears in his eyes.
1:45:22|1:45:34|In front of the people, the two troublemakers who harmed the concubines, [Mu Renzhi] from the royal family, were taken away for execution. The royal merit monument and various plaques hanging were all knocked down.
1:45:38|1:45:46|People lit a big fire, burning the rented items and signs to ashes, everyone clapped and cheered.
1:45:55|1:46:15|It's another sunny day. Passing through the trees with blooming flowers, we can see [Da Chun] and [Xi'er] bundling straw. [Auntie Wang] watches the loving couple and can't stop smiling. [Xi'er] takes off her headscarf, revealing her shiny black hair.
1:46:15|1:46:19|She handed the handkerchief to [Da Chun] and watched the villagers working hard in the distance.
1:46:26|1:46:41|[Da Chun] carried two bundles of straw in front, with [Xi'er] holding a bunch of straw following behind. He smiled happily, his eyes filled with hope and anticipation for a better future.
