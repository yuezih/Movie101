0:1:54|0:2:14|In the scene, Lan Tian's lonely figure walks through the ice and snow, under the bright sun, with two wolves quietly following behind. As the scene shifts, the film officially begins. This is Jiashanda Ban, with an altitude of 5248 meters, the starting point of the three-way intersection along the southern Kunlun Mountains, crossing the uninhabited area of ​​Qiangtang.
0:2:15|0:2:34|Light snow covers the mountaintop, a small tent stands in the vast wilderness, [Lan Tian] lies in the tent, next to a boiling water bottle, steam filling his face, he coughs constantly, his eyes vacant, lost in thought. After a while, a figure appears outside the tent.
0:2:35|0:2:47|A figure peered outside for a moment, then walked towards the exit of the tent. [Yang Liusong] sat up, alertly sizing up the situation, and then unzipped the tent. In front of him stood a soldier in camouflage military uniform.
0:3:6|0:3:11|The soldier solemnly looked [Yang Liusong] up and down, making [Yang Liusong] feel a bit embarrassed.
0:3:21|0:3:28|[Xiao Qiao] took the medicine and ran to hand it to the soldier. The soldier took it and passed it to [Yang Liusong], who looked at him gratefully.
0:3:43|0:3:59|After saluting and shaking hands, the soldiers got into the car and drove off, heading towards the vast horizon. The yellow earth was covered with snow, and wisps of green clouds floated in the blue sky, blending with the horizon. Several geese spread their wings and flew in the distance.
0:3:59|0:4:8|[Yang Liusong] walked to the side of the road with a worried expression, watching the car gradually disappear. He turned around, only to see the endless desert and the dry, cold sunlight behind him.
0:4:9|0:4:20|Surrounded by unpredictable unknown dangers, Lan Tian made a decision to pack up his tent and belongings, put them on his bicycle, and continue his journey after a moment of contemplation and hesitation.
0:4:24|0:4:36|Alone, trekking through the wilderness. Eighty days, no signs of civilization, no backup.
0:4:42|0:5:1|Wearing gloves, adjusting his hat, Lan Tian looked up with determination. Taking a deep breath, he pushed the cart through a vertical trench, then walked forward with large strides. The camera slowly zoomed out, showing only the tracks left by the wheels on the vast desert along the way.
0:5:2|0:5:16|The ground beneath their feet was hard with stones and sand densely embedded. In the distance, the horizon stretched endlessly between the sky and the earth, with the solitary and resilient figure of a sheep.
0:5:21|0:5:33|The vast plateau desert meets the sky, with clouds hanging low and illuminated by the faint sunlight. Through the telescope, the figure of [Yang Liusong] slowly moves along the boundary line.
0:5:45|0:6:2|Depending on the road conditions, he sometimes walked forward and sometimes rode in a vehicle. On the vast plain, he left behind his resolute figure. The vastness of nature was magnified to the extreme at this moment, reflecting the insignificance of humanity. It is precisely because of this that every step taken by [Yang Liusong],
0:6:5|0:6:20|Every step taken by [Yang Liusong] seemed more like a declaration of bravery and resilience for humanity, knowing it was impossible. Slowly, he walked past a lake in the desert, quenching his thirst with its clear water, the ripples reflecting the white clouds in the sky.
0:6:20|0:6:42|He walked across the gradually melting glacier, raising his camera to record the melting snow, converging into a river. The slightly surging waves in the river rolled gently, the clouds gradually lowered with the passage of time, turning the sky into black. Under the black clouds, a strong wind rose, dust flying, making the advance very difficult.
0:6:42|0:6:52|He propped up a large umbrella, tied it to the back of his bicycle to resist the wind, and rode towards the direction it was blowing, advancing towards the rugged and undulating mountains.
0:6:53|0:7:11|[Yang Liusong] is in a hurry, his body leaping and kicking quickly. With his head hitting the rocks and the uneven grass, he quickly loses his balance. He falls off the car, but soon regains his composure and continues forward. The wind clears the sky, dispersing the clouds.
0:7:11|0:7:20|[Yang Liusong] arrived at a grassland, not far away were herds of Tibetan antelopes. She got out of the car and walked, watching the antelopes running past as she walked.
0:7:30|0:7:51|The scene shifts, with the sky slightly darkening. Lan Tian pushes a cart over a hill and arrives at a lake. The setting sun illuminates the lake, creating a shimmering reflection. On the grassy ground nearby, two squirrels face the sunset, peeking around curiously. Lan Tian unloads his gear by the lake, sets up a tent, and this will be their overnight stop.
0:7:53|0:8:2|[Yang Liusong] was completely blacked out. Inside the tent, [Yang Liusong] set up a stove with a portable air pump, placed a small pot on it, scooped out a few spoonfuls of protein powder, and put it in the pot.
0:8:38|0:8:42|On April 20, 2010, at an altitude of 4658 meters in the Su Camp.
0:8:55|0:9:1|[Yang Liusong] fell into memories. It was his first day arriving at Jieshan to work as a lumberjack, hitching a ride on a truck carrying a flock of sheep.
0:9:8|0:9:25|The truck stopped at the entrance of the mountain road, and [Yang Liusong] stood up from a group of sheep behind the truck, throwing the luggage down one by one. Finally, he lifted the bicycle and passed through the sheep, placing the bike down. After getting off the truck, he waved to the driver who was about to leave to express his gratitude.
0:9:25|0:9:44|On the plateau, going through this simple procedure has left him a bit breathless. He packed up while heavily panting. As the truck slowly drove away, he looked down and felt like something was missing. Suddenly, he realized that he had left behind two important packages.
0:9:44|0:9:47|He panicked and dropped the bike he was holding onto, chasing after the truck.
0:9:55|0:10:12|But the driver did not hear the shouts of [Yang Liusong], the car drove further and further away. [Yang Liusong] rode his bicycle to chase after, pedaling hard, but the distance kept increasing. Gradually, [Yang Liusong] felt out of breath and had to stop, gasping for air with his mouth wide open.
0:10:12|0:10:22|Two years of careful preparation couldn't compare to a twist of fate. The two headlamps were left on the truck, so they had to return to Lhasa to replenish their equipment.
0:10:23|0:10:44|The scene shifts to the city of Lhasa, with low-rise buildings surrounded by mountains, and the Potala Palace standing tall in the midst, clustered around the mountains, grand and majestic. Along the zigzagging steps, the White Palace is supported by the horse wall, while the Red Palace sits on the mountaintop, revealing ancient and mysterious grandeur.
0:10:44|0:10:47|In a narrow alley, the female lead [Lan Tian] is fixing a flat tire under the car.
0:10:55|0:11:11|He struggled to climb out from under the car, gasping for breath as he leaned against the body of the car. He unzipped his jacket, using his hands to adjust his two numb and limp legs. After wiping off the sweat, he continued to prepare to remove the tire. Just then, Yang Liusong rode by on his bicycle.
0:11:14|0:11:25|One tire was firmly pressing down on [Lan Tian] who hadn't stabilized himself. He struggled to move the tire with his waist and fingers. Seeing this, [Yang Liusong] quickly got out of the car to help him lift the tire.
0:11:32|0:11:46|Pushing aside [Yang Liusong], [Lan Tian] struggled to put the tire on. [Yang Liusong] was a bit puzzled, but seeing the other's determined and stubborn look, he still pushed the wheelchair away. When they reached the corner, he turned back and saw the wheelchair. It turned out that [Lan Tian] was disabled.
0:11:46|0:11:49|Later, [Yang Liusong] arrived at the home of the [Veteran Captain].
0:11:56|0:11:58|The Veteran Captain said to Yang Liusong.
0:12:4|0:12:8|At this moment, Lan Tian wheeled in.
0:13:3|0:13:6|The Veteran Captain nodded helplessly.
0:13:33|0:13:49|Lan Tian arrived at Xie's place, leaving in a wheelchair. Yang Liusong looked at the photos on the wall of the inn in surprise. In the photo, Lan Tian stood gracefully on the plateau, with a happy smile on her face. A song started playing, and Yang Liusong followed the sound into the inn.
0:13:49|0:13:53|It turned out that [Lan Tian] was playing the guitar, singing for the guests staying at the hotel.
0:14:53|0:15:2|After the performance, [Lan Tian] started teaching life skills to the disabled. Following the music, [Lan Tian] joyfully swayed and danced in the wheelchair.
0:15:37|0:15:47|[Yang Liusong] sets up an easel on the side, sketching a map of the desolate area. [Lan Tian] enthusiastically helps the disabled people and then looks in awe towards [Yang Liusong] and the map.
0:15:49|0:15:57|The crowd dispersed, and in the quiet of the night, [Lan Tian] wheeled himself to the map alone.
0:16:11|0:16:29|He took out a pen and drew a question mark after the eighty days written by [Yang Liusong]. In the early morning, sunlight shone into the room, and the dog [Little Wolf] jumped off the windowsill and ran away, the camera entering the room. [Lan Tian] sat up from the bed, picked up a thermos cup and drank a large glass of water, with a urine bag beside him.
0:16:30|0:16:44|He sat in a wheelchair, using his hands to lift his legs to his chest for stretching, then struggled to put on his shoes. On the other side, Yang Liusong also woke up, frowning, lying flat on the bed, pondering for a while before suddenly sitting up.
0:16:44|0:16:55|Carrying their luggage, Lan Tian rode a bicycle to the notice board outside the inn's courtyard. The board was covered with sticky notes, each with information about finding companions, carpooling, and tour guides.
0:16:56|0:17:16|[Yang Liusong] also posted a piece of paper with the words "Aliqiu Dai, [Yang Liusong], 13910093013" written on it. Then, he walked to the map and looked at the question mark marked by [Lan Tian]. After a moment of contemplation, he decisively crossed out the question mark and drew an arrow pointing to the east.
0:17:16|0:17:20|In the next scene, in the courtyard, [Lan Tian] is being interviewed by journalists.
0:18:4|0:18:18|[Yang Liusong] silently came to the rooftop and looked down at [Lan Tian]. After seeing off the journalists, [Lan Tian] picked up a book and started reading quietly. Inside the book was a photo of himself, and he gently touched the smiling face in the picture.
0:18:20|0:18:37|A wave of loss and pain hit him, he threw the book away and walked into the room. He saw the arrow left by [Yang Liusong] on the map, and he froze, then a faint smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. On the other side, [Yang Liusong] was in the room, recalling what [Veteran Captain] had said.
0:18:50|0:19:8|Thinking of all this, [Yang Liusong]'s expression became even more serious. Meanwhile, [Lan Tian] was sitting quietly alone on the rooftop. He looked up at the sky, then gazed at the distant rooftops, mountains, and ridges, feeling an overwhelming sense of melancholy and sadness for those unattainable aspirations in this lifetime.
0:19:26|0:19:46|At night, [Lan Tian] wheeled himself into the courtyard of the inn. Passing by his own photo on the wall, he stopped. Looking at the free, happy, and complete self in the photo, and the magnificent mountains and rivers behind him, a bold decision ignited in his heart. A smile slowly appeared on his face.
0:19:48|0:19:57|The next morning, Lan Tian packed up his belongings, placed the room key next to the sleeping Veteran Captain, and left the inn in a wheelchair.
0:19:57|0:20:14|He drove towards the mountains, and when he reached a fork in the road, a familiar figure appeared ahead. A man pushing a bicycle was trying to stop the passing cars. [Lan Tian] carefully observed and realized it was Yang Liusong. He stopped next to Yang.
0:20:15|0:20:37|Memories stop, and time goes back to this moment. Today is the second day, at an altitude of 4568 meters. [Yang Liusong] stands by the lake, gazing into the distance. As the sky brightens and the lake ripples, he sets off again. For this long journey, the lost equipment such as sunglasses, hat, and gloves are all replaced with spares.
0:20:42|0:20:44|The solar panel placed on the front of the car.
0:20:58|0:21:15|In the blink of an eye, it was the fifth day, at an altitude of 4998 meters. [Yang Liusong] rode his bike swiftly down a hill. Then, he walked with his bike between a few small hills, when suddenly a loud noise came from behind.
0:21:15|0:21:24|He turned around and saw dust flying in the air, with a sandstorm rapidly approaching towards him. He exclaimed in shock and hurriedly pushed the cart forward to run.
0:21:45|0:22:4|The sandstorm was fierce, swirling rapidly, creating chaos in an instant. [Yang Liusong] struggled to run forward, but the sandstorm closed in from all directions in the next moment, leaving him with no way out. His eyes were also blinded by the sand, and the rolling red sand quickly engulfed him.
0:22:5|0:22:23|[Yang Liusong] could no longer distinguish the direction. He wrapped a scarf around his mouth and nose, struggling to move forward in the raging wind. However, when he reached a slope, he lost his balance and fell to the ground. The smoke and sand were still surging, [Yang Liusong] knelt on the ground, curled up, burying his head in his hands.
0:22:23|0:22:27|After a long time, the storm finally passed, and the world suddenly quieted down.
0:22:28|0:22:47|The yellow sand dispersed, the view became clear, and [Yang Liusong] lying on the ground was covered in sand. He slowly raised his head, the sun was shining brightly in the sky, the intense ultraviolet rays made it difficult for him to open his eyes. He pulled down the scarf covering his mouth, spat out a mouthful of dust, and panted as he scanned the surroundings.
0:22:47|0:22:51|The scene cuts to [Yang Liusong] sitting in a tent, wiping the dust off his face in front of a mirror.
0:22:53|0:23:9|Later, [Yang Liusong] opened the tent, and the amber glowed in the lingering light of the setting sun. Feeling the chill outside, [Yang Liusong] ran in circles to keep warm. At night, he took out his camera and aimed it at [Lan Tian].
0:23:35|0:23:53|The scene returns to before the departure. At this moment, [Yang Liusong] has already hitched a ride with [Lan Tian] on the winding mountain road. The two travel in silence, with a tense expression on [Yang Liusong]'s face. He notices that due to her disability, [Lan Tian]'s brakes and accelerator have been modified.
0:23:54|0:24:6|The note left by Ali Qiu was inserted in the sun visor of the car. [Yang Liusong] looked at [Lan Tian] in confusion, and [Lan Tian] noticed [Yang Liusong]'s gaze but pretended nothing had happened, continuing to drive.
0:24:6|0:24:13|The car drove to the shore of Lake Zoyongcu, where the altitude is 4441 meters, in Tibet, one of the three sacred lakes.
0:24:15|0:24:25|The lake is surrounded by mountains, with calm and vast water, clear and tranquil blue. [Lan Tian] took two photos, reaching out of the car window, feeling extremely exhilarated.
0:24:36|0:24:43|[Lan Tian] rolled down the car window, and the two of them descended from the mountain and arrived in the city. [Yang Liusong] was asking a driver for a ride.
0:25:7|0:25:10|Yang turned around and saw [Lan Tian] in front of a noodle shop across the street.
0:25:12|0:25:39|Wandering around and calling for the boss, Lan Tian was blocked by a few steps in front of the shop. Yang hurried across the street and ran over to help. Yang reached out from behind and carefully pulled Lan Tian up the steps, guiding him through the somewhat narrow door.
0:25:42|0:25:49|Lan Tian, who had disinfected the tableware in hot water, noticed Yang's restlessness while dining in the noodle shop.
0:26:3|0:26:7|Yang glanced at [Lan Tian], then turned to look out the window and put down his chopsticks.
0:26:17|0:26:36|Watching [Lan Tian] calmly eating noodles, although Yang was a bit worried, he still decisively picked up his backpack and left in a hurry. He ran to the road, but the hitchhiking car had already left. He solemnly looked in the direction the car went, unconsciously took a few steps forward, and almost bumped into a carriage.
0:26:36|0:26:46|Reluctantly, Yang had to get back into the car driven by [Lan Tian]. The modified car was moving very slowly, testing Yang's patience. He then tentatively asked [Lan Tian].
0:26:59|0:27:5|At a loss for words, [Yang Liusong] hesitated for a moment, but seeing the determined look on [Lan Tian]'s face, he eventually opened the car door.
0:27:15|0:27:26|[Lan Tian] said nothing, he rubbed his nose in annoyance, gave [Yang Liusong] a meaningful glare with cold eyes. Seemingly hesitant to speak, but eventually acquiesced.
0:27:50|0:27:53|Lan Tian looked ahead and received no response.
0:28:0|0:28:21|[Lan Tian] took a big sip of water, nodded, and efficiently opened the car door. He took out the wheelchair parts from the back and assembled them one by one. Supporting the seat, he skillfully moved the wheelchair from the car and then grabbed a toiletry bag and a clean down jacket, pushing the wheelchair towards the bathhouse.
0:28:21|0:28:28|In the narrow alley, the sound of cicadas and barking dogs never ceased, the intense sunlight shone on the car body, reflecting a dazzling light.
0:28:36|0:28:41|Time returns to the journey again, this is the tenth day at the Hengchuan Gun Altar for [Yang Liusong], at an altitude of 5,112 meters.
0:28:43|0:29:3|He arrived at a desert, with barren surroundings and extreme lack of oxygen making him feel dizzy. Everything in front of him seemed hazy, as if a black shadow appeared. He covered one eye with his hand and focused the other eye on the shadow. He saw clearly, a strong wild yak was charging straight towards him.
0:29:9|0:29:26|With the warning voice of [Veteran Captain] ringing in his ears, the yaks were getting closer and closer. Fear made [Yang Liusong] completely lose the thought of self-rescue, standing still in place. The next second, just as the yak was about to hit him, it suddenly stopped in its tracks, staring straight at the humans in front of it.
0:29:27|0:29:48|[Yang Liusong] was scared out of his wits, trembling with his eyes closed and gasping for breath. A few seconds later, the yak turned and walked away. Watching its back, [Yang Liusong] felt his legs go weak and collapsed on the ground. But suddenly, the yak made a sudden charge, turned around and ran towards [Yang Liusong] again.
0:29:48|0:29:55|[Yang Liusong] repented, quickly stood up and pushed the car, fleeing in panic, running to a slope, and slid down with a clang.
0:30:10|0:30:23|Arriving at the slope, [Yang Liusong] discovered that the surrounding area was littered with animal bones, with piles every few steps. The bones were of various shapes, seemingly from different species, almost crumbling at a touch.
0:30:23|0:30:31|In the distance, there are still a few oil drums and bottles scattered around, these are traces left by humans, so are there humans among these bones?
0:30:32|0:30:49|Lan Tian looked down in disbelief, observing the scene in front of him. He then stood up and walked around the oil drum, while in the distance, it seemed like a pair of eyes were watching his every move, ready to strike at any moment. A sense of danger loomed in the air.
0:30:55|0:31:27|At night, with the bright moon hanging high in the sky, [Yang Liusong] sat in the tent with a head-mounted outdoor lighting lamp, writing in his diary to record his journey. Suddenly, a chilling howl of a wolf was heard, causing him to stop writing. He turned off the lamp and listened carefully to the sounds outside. It was the wind mixed with a few sharp noises of something scraping against the tent.
0:31:27|0:31:48|A few seconds later, the sound gradually faded. [Yang Liusong] turned on the light again and continued writing. It was the twelfth day, at an altitude of 5,112 meters. [Yang Liusong] passed by a theodolite inserted into the ground. He parked the car on the side and looked up at this rare human trace.
0:32:1|0:32:13|[Yang Liusong] paced back and forth by the measuring instrument, taking photos, drinking water, sitting down and then standing up. The scene then shifted to before departure, with [Lan Tian]'s car parked at Zhu Feng's gas station.
0:32:17|0:32:43|The gas station attendant walked up to the car window and peered in, saying. [Lan Tian] leaned half of his body out of the window, looking back with a worried expression on his face. Then, he turned his head, sighed heavily after a moment of contemplation, and reluctantly fastened his seatbelt before starting the car.
0:32:47|0:32:56|The car stopped at a highland near the Jiaula Pass, at an altitude of 8848 meters, with Mount Everest in full view.
0:33:17|0:33:33|Not far away, one mountain peak after another stretches continuously, with snow still lingering on the heights, creating a vast expanse of white. [Lan Tian] sits in a wheelchair, facing the surrounding mountains with excitement, breathing heavily. Beside him, a sheep gazes quietly.
0:33:33|0:33:41|Lan Tian shed tears after a long time, facing the mountains and rivers, finally feeling that his life is free and unrestrained.
0:33:54|0:34:2|Watching Lan Tian gasping for breath, Yang Liusong silently walked behind him, the gentle breeze rustling their clothes, the sky clear and pure.
0:34:2|0:34:16|For a while, [Lan Tian] sensed [Yang Liusong] behind him. He turned around and cheerfully handed the camera to him, asking for help to take a photo. Then he took off his hat, unzipped his jacket, fixed his hair, sat up straight, and revealed a brilliant smile.
0:34:17|0:34:26|[Yang Liusong] took a few steps back, squatted down and prepared to press the shutter button, but was noticed by [Lan Tian] that he hadn't removed the lens cap. [Lan Tian] smiled and reminded him.
0:34:53|0:35:12|At this moment, [Yang Liusong] stood on the theodolite, with [Lan Tian] facing the sun, her face bathed in sunlight and a warm, pure smile appearing before her.
0:35:54|0:36:11|At an altitude of 5117 meters, [Yang Liusong] spent the night in a vast expanse of white snow. In the morning, he put a spoonful of egg white powder, some cheese, and seasonings in a boiling pot, then carried it outside and looked into the distance while eating.
0:36:12|0:36:23|White clouds hung low, leading into the horizon. On the snowy ground, herds of cattle and sheep formed a line, slowly moving eastward. [Yang Liusong] stood quietly, gazing at them, rooted to the spot for a long time.
0:36:35|0:36:53|After a while, he continued on his journey. Not long after he set off, a blizzard descended once again, fiercely sweeping across the desolate wilderness. [Yang Liusong] pushed his bicycle, the rapidly descending ice and snow cutting through his body like sharp blades, making every step of his extremely difficult. Finally, the snow stopped.
0:36:53|0:36:59|Yang walked to a glacier where the ice and snow had melted, leaving behind a meandering river.
0:37:11|0:37:23|At night, [Lan Tian] lay in the tent, looking weak and in pain, with his eyes closed, breathing heavily. As morning arrived, [Lan Tian] suddenly sat up from the ground.
0:37:30|0:37:40|[Yang Liusong] lit a small stove, cooking and keeping warm at the same time. Slowly, he fell into contemplation, feeling worried and lost due to his physical discomfort.
0:37:43|0:37:57|Raising his head, a shadow of an animal suddenly appeared outside the tent. [Yang Liusong] was shocked and looked outside the tent, where a wolf was staring at him. He quickly zipped up one side of the tent, but on the other side, the wolf was already standing there.
0:38:8|0:38:28|The sheep held a small pot, constantly resisting the approaching wolf. The wolf took a few steps back, and the sheep tried to zip up the zipper, but the next second, the wolf barked and charged again. After several rounds of counterattacks, the [Big Wolf] finally temporarily retreated. The sheep hurriedly zipped up the zipper, holding the pot nervously and alertly lying in the tent.
0:38:28|0:38:30|Suddenly, the shadow of [Big Wolf] appeared outside the tent.
0:38:34|0:38:42|[Big Wolf] kept trying to enter the tent, fear almost drove Lan Tian to lose his mind, he held a pot and kept hitting the shadow outside.
0:38:54|0:39:9|Yang Liusong, exhausted, lay in the tent, gasping in pain, unable to calm down for a long time. Outside, two [wolves] were still scratching at the tent with their claws, sniffing around with their noses. One of them approached the corner of the tent, sticking out its tongue and licking the tent.
0:39:10|0:39:25|After a long silence, the [Big Wolf] started digging a hole in place, while the sheep inside couldn't hide their panic at this moment. It put the pot on its head and closed its eyes. The two [Big Wolves] outside kept lingering around, showing no intention of leaving.
0:39:26|0:39:44|Today's time was wasted, trapped by [Big Wolf], Lan Tian could only sit in the tent all day, waiting until nightfall. He lay on his side, listening carefully to the outside movements. After confirming there was no sound, he turned on the overhead light, cautiously sat up, not daring to make any noise.
0:39:44|0:39:53|The tension made him even more dry-mouthed, he picked up the thermos next to him and poured it into his mouth, but the cup was already empty, not a drop of water.
0:39:54|0:40:8|[Yang Liusong] sat up restlessly, scanning around inside the tent. Currently, there was a mysterious pool of water in a depression in front of the tent, which caught [Yang Liusong]'s attention. He stared fixedly at the puddle on the ground.
0:40:8|0:40:14|Without hesitation, Lan Tian crawled over and swiftly drank the water, finishing it in one gulp.
0:40:33|0:40:44|After drinking the water, [Yang Liusong] slowly approached the zipper, carefully assessing the situation outside with a look of tension in his weary eyes.
0:40:44|0:40:55|After confirming that there was no movement, [Yang Liusong] put on his assault jacket, holding a pot in one hand and a thermos cup in the other, and carefully opened a gap in the zipper, using the thermos cup to reach out.
0:41:15|0:41:21|[Yang Liusong] lay weakly, with a vacant look in his eyes, as the sound of mournful wolf howls drifted in from outside the tent.
0:41:37|0:41:52|[Yang Liusong] turned off the overhead light, and the tent was instantly plunged into darkness. The howling of wolves continued outside, and the icy despair and collapse swept over him crazily. He rested his arms on his eyes, clenched his fists, and gasped quietly.
0:41:52|0:42:3|In the scene, back at the starting point in the desert, [Yang Liusong] is helping [Lan Tian] push the car out of the sand pit.
0:42:17|0:42:42|The car was pushed out of the pit, [Lan Tian] stopped and [Yang Liusong] walked over panting, leaning against the car. He took the mineral water handed to him by [Lan Tian] from the car and gulped it down. Beside him, [Lan Tian] also opened a thermos cup and drank heartily. [Lan Tian] asked with concern.
0:43:59|0:44:8|[Yang Liusong] realized he had said the wrong thing and looked apologetically at [Lan Tian]. [Lan Tian] took off the small whistle tied to the rearview mirror in the car and handed it to [Yang Liusong].
0:44:16|0:44:34|The scene cuts back to the tent, where [Yang Liusong] is recalling [Lan Tian]'s words. His gaze shifts to the whistle hanging on his backpack. He takes it out for a moment, removes the whistle, holds it in his hand and examines it carefully, suddenly realizing something. At this moment, the whistle may save his life just like it once saved [Lan Tian].
0:44:35|0:45:0|He rallied, sat up and looked back. He wasn't sure if blowing the whistle would bring good or bad luck, but at the moment, he seemed to have no choice but to fight to the death. Finally, he summoned up the courage and blew the whistle.
0:45:0|0:45:23|It seemed to work, and there was suddenly no movement outside. The next day at dawn, [Yang Liusong] wrapped himself in the tent, only sticking his head out of the zipper to look at the road, and hurriedly fled pushing his bicycle. He walked down the hillside cautiously, and when he looked back up, two wolves were standing on the top of the slope staring at him.
0:45:23|0:45:33|Things took a turn for the worse, [Yang Liusong] hurriedly bent over and started to run. After a few steps, he suddenly stopped and looked up, only to see two wolves still following his movements.
0:45:44|0:45:58|The blinding sun shone down from the top of the slope, enveloping their poised figures. Tension and fear covered [Yang Liusong]'s forehead with beads of sweat. Using a tent as cover, he kept the wolves at bay for the time being.
0:46:2|0:46:5|He rides his bike and starts fleeing at high speed.
0:46:18|0:46:32|Erlang ran towards [Yang Liusong] from the top of the slope. In extreme panic, [Yang Liusong] fell from the hillside, tumbling down like a ball of wool. As he rolled on the ground, before catching his breath, he looked up and saw two wolves on the hill.
0:46:32|0:46:44|He hurriedly pushed the cart to continue fleeing, while the not-so-low hill trapped the two wolves for a moment, wandering in place. As Jianlang did not catch up, [Yang Liusong] relaxed and continued on the road as usual.
0:46:52|0:47:7|He pushed the cart onto a bumpy stone road, and suddenly there was a strange noise coming from the hillside. He stopped and looked up, only to see a crow flying frantically across, with some rocks on the mountain suddenly falling.
0:47:15|0:47:34|Sensing the danger, [Yang Liusong] hurriedly increased his pace and moved forward. His panting forced him to breathe through his mouth, while the commotion on the hill was caused by the two wolves being lured over. The next moment, they surrounded [Yang Liusong] from front and back.
0:47:34|0:47:39|Looking at the fierce and ferocious wolf in front of him, [Yang Liusong] tremblingly took out a dagger.
0:47:51|0:48:3|After a few tentative barks, two wolves suddenly ran towards [Yang Liusong], one in front and one behind. The rugged rocks caused the panicked [Yang Liusong] to fall to the ground. He lay there, waving the knife frantically at the wolves rushing towards him.
0:48:10|0:48:19|Yang Liusong, unable to resist, huddled on the ground with his head in his arms. Strangely, the wolf suddenly stopped its attack, looked back a few times, and then left happily.
0:48:19|0:48:37|A heavy sound of footsteps rang in the ears, [Yang Liusong] sat up, looking around in confusion. A large black bear suddenly appeared in front of him, causing him to retreat in fear. However, the bear just passed by him and, after walking ahead, turned back to look at him before quickly leaving.
0:48:38|0:48:43|In the midst of the dusty ground, Lan Tian watches the black bear's receding figure, feeling incredulous.
0:48:48|0:48:59|Its suspended heart finally landed, lying on the ground, it breathed a sigh of relief. The scene shifts, Lan Tian comes to a corner of a hill, packs up and sets up the tent.
0:49:55|0:50:12|The cold wind is still howling, [Yang] lifts his head, his gaze scattered and weary. The clouds drift and float with the passage of time, gradually disappearing completely, exposing the sunlight, shining hotly on the bell iron stones and [Yang].
0:50:12|0:50:17|[Yang] sat still, with the wolf beside him also lying down, closely watching every move [Yang] made.
0:50:31|0:50:41|Er Lang, alert, sat up and stared warily at [Yang]. [Yang] put the cake into his own mouth, took a fierce bite, and then threw it towards his brother.
0:50:51|0:51:10|[Yang] threw a cake in front of the wolf, but the wolf showed no reaction. [Yang] helplessly took out a piece of jerky, chewed on it, and then threw it towards the wolf. This time it finally caught its attention, and two wolves ran forward to pick it up and eat it. [Yang Liusong] immediately got up and ran away.
0:51:10|0:51:15|In a daze, she had a hallucination that two wolves seemed to turn into giant creatures, relentlessly chasing her from behind.
0:51:22|0:51:27|He ran into the tent at full speed, zipped it up, picked up the knife, and stared outside in terror.
0:51:43|0:52:0|Gradually, Lan Tian felt a sudden intense dizziness, exhaustion and fear making his face pale. He felt all the objects in front of him floating and swaying. Outside the tent, the sun was setting in the west, with eagles circling low in the sky, and soon the sky darkened again.
0:52:0|0:52:7|Before long, Yang fell asleep and woke up the next morning, startled to find a dagger still stuck in the ground beside him.
0:52:8|0:52:24|He carefully opened the tent and peeked outside, the wolves seemed to have disappeared. He slowly stepped out of the tent, carefully searched the area, confirmed that the two wolves had left, and then relaxed to pack up his things and continue on the road.
0:52:35|0:52:52|It was the 38th day, at an altitude of 4986 meters. [Yang Liusong] walked into a vast and flat desert, surrounded by intense sunlight and dryness. His body started to send signals, and he urgently needed a water source. He picked up the binoculars to explore the surroundings, searching for a lake.
0:52:53|0:53:11|After no success, he took out a handheld GPS device and carefully observed the geological information displayed on it. Then, he drove towards the coordinates of the water source shown on the GPS. After a trek, [Yang Liusong] finally arrived, only to find a desolate desert in front of him.
0:53:12|0:53:29|[Yang Liusong] no longer had hesitation in his eyes, but rather silent anger. It seemed like a mockery from the heavens, a test to completely break him down. Helplessly, [Yang Liusong] could only move towards the next location indicated by the GPS, but the result was the same.
0:53:29|0:53:33|When [Yang Liusong] arrived, all he saw was the barren sandy soil scorched by the sun.
0:53:40|0:53:58|[Yang Liusong] took out a cup from his backpack, glanced at the little water left inside, hesitated for a moment, and slowly took a sip. Then, he looked at the cup again, only one last sip left. He really wanted to hold on to this last bit of hope, but he was just too thirsty, it was the most irresistible temptation for him at the moment.
0:53:59|0:54:16|He closed his eyes and took the final sip. Suddenly, a movement beside him caught his attention. He looked up and saw those two wolves again. They were approaching him, staring at the sheep on the nearby hill. The sheep dared not linger, quickly got on the car and left.
0:54:30|0:54:51|He walked through the dry and desolate desert, arriving near the next lake as indicated by the GPS. He stopped by a small mound, unloaded his luggage here, and took a water cup and a small pot with him to search around. Fortune favors the prepared mind, the soil here was moist, showing traces of being washed by water.
0:54:51|0:54:59|He continued forward, and finally a shallow water area appeared ahead. [Yang Liusong] ran over excitedly and threw something on the ground.
0:55:2|0:55:8|Reaching into the water eagerly, Lan Tian scooped up a mouthful and put it in his mouth, but the next second, he spat it out.
0:55:21|0:55:39|Yang Liusong returned to the place where the luggage was placed, looking aimlessly at the desolate plain in front of him, feeling helpless and disappointed. He then walked towards the fallen bicycle, sat down slowly after dropping what he was holding, and let out a few breaths.
0:55:40|0:55:52|His legs were weary and his body exhausted, he leaned back against his luggage and didn't want to move anymore. At that moment, a plane flew across the sky, leaving behind two white streaks.
0:55:52|0:56:5|[Yang Liusong] lowered his head in thought for a moment, then lifted his bicycle again and walked towards the unknown ahead. The boundless plain seemed to merge with the sky. The figure of [Yang Liusong] pushing the bicycle appeared particularly small.
0:56:6|0:56:24|The rugged coastal area is full of ups and downs, and the parts on the bicycle make a metallic clashing sound due to constant shaking. Unconsciously, it is already noon, and the scorching heat from the sun above is even more intense. Two wolves can be seen following the sheep from a distance.
0:56:24|0:56:32|At this moment, Lan Tian pushed his bicycle forward with his head down, bending his upper body to grip the handlebars, completely ignoring the situation behind him.
0:56:33|0:56:46|He took a few more steps forward, then suddenly looked up at the sky and stopped. Yang Liusong turned his head to look behind him, his eyes filled with exhaustion. Two wolves saw him stop and also paused to observe his movements.
0:56:52|0:57:3|Feeling lost, Lan Tian looked helplessly at the endless barrel of the gun in the no-man's land. A wolf watched his fading figure and quickly moved its feet to follow.
0:57:3|0:57:17|Not long after they had set off, Lan Tian stopped again, turned back to look at his stunned companion, and let out a warning howl. Soon after, two wolves ran side by side behind the sheep, while the ground along the coast gradually melted away.
0:57:18|0:57:37|The sparkling water reflects the figure of Lan Tian, who is staring ahead like a wolf. At this moment, Yang Liusong, pushing his bicycle, feels the road ahead becoming increasingly blurry, and his feet as if stepping on cotton, unable to exert any force. Soon, the water under his feet becomes deeper and deeper, and every step Yang takes in the water creates splashes.
0:57:37|0:57:41|The pant legs couldn't escape the washing of the splashes, and the soaked area was getting larger and larger.
0:57:42|0:57:59|And [Yang Liusong] himself, however, paid no attention, pushing his bicycle slowly away as if nothing had happened. The sunlight shone down on the water, like soft halos floating on the lake. At this moment, the salt lake looked like a flawless jade shimmering with beautiful luster.
0:57:59|0:58:6|In the distance, the vast white lake blends with the sky, almost indistinguishable whether it is water or sky.
0:58:6|0:58:24|At this moment, [Yang Liusong] is riding a bicycle floating in this shallow water, with the wheels creating a sparkling wave behind him. The clear sky above is cloudless for miles, as if washed by clear water, only at the boundary between the water fields, a few acres of pure white clouds remain.
0:58:24|0:58:33|[Yang Liusong] rode his bike further and further away, the empty lake surface showing no ripples, like a mirror reflecting the beautiful colors of the sky.
0:58:34|0:58:40|A few drifting white clouds are scattered along the horizon.
0:58:56|0:59:10|The light from the setting sun was no longer intense, but it illuminated the path ahead of Yang even more brightly. At this moment, the scene shifted back to the memories before departure. Yang was riding a bicycle, pulling Lan Tian sitting in a wheelchair.
0:59:21|0:59:36|[Lan Tian] dragged the luggage placed on the car seat by [Yang Liusong], the two of them leisurely shouting on the empty road, showing genuine smiles from the heart. At this moment, [Lan Tian] deliberately turned the wheelchair to the right, and [Yang Liusong]'s bicycle almost rode into the ravine.
0:59:40|0:59:50|After speaking, [Lan Tian] vigorously turned the wheelchair with both hands, leaning forward, while [Yang Liusong] effortlessly rode his bicycle past him.
0:59:50|1:0:5|Upon reaching the top of the road, [Yang Liusong] stopped and looked ahead, at which point the smile on [Lan Tian]'s face gradually disappeared. He then stubbornly turned his wheelchair around, spinning the wheels faster and faster, silently watching as he passed by himself.
1:0:6|1:0:21|At this moment, [Lan Tian] held onto the handle and let the wheelchair glide freely down the slope. Before long, he let go of the handle directly and opened his arms. Sitting in the wheelchair, [Lan Tian] enjoyed the gentle breeze on his face, revealing a beautiful smile involuntarily.
1:0:21|1:0:28|At this moment, his hands no longer need to exert force to turn, yet they can easily wander on this incredibly wide road.
1:0:29|1:0:43|[Lan Tian] closed his eyes and tilted his head back, savoring the moment of joy. [Yang Liusong] watched his back and couldn't help but smile. But soon, his expression turned serious, and he quickly mounted his bicycle, speeding towards [Lan Tian].
1:0:43|1:0:57|At this moment, [Lan Tian] still had his eyes closed and arms outstretched. [Yang Liusong] caught up and rode in front of [Lan Tian], blocking the wheelchair. Before [Lan Tian] could react, he was thrown out. [Yang Liusong] reached out and caught him, and both of them fell to the ground together.
1:0:59|1:1:12|[Yang Liusong] tried to sit up and help [Lan Tian], but he suddenly got angry and pushed [Yang Liusong]'s hand away, struggling to crawl towards the wheelchair. [Yang Liusong] tried to approach him again to hug him, but was once again coldly rejected by [Lan Tian].
1:1:12|1:1:19|Sulking Lan Tian raised his hand, took off his hat and threw it on the ground, grabbed the wheels of the wheelchair, moved his arms slowly and climbed forward.
1:1:26|1:1:33|Suddenly, she buried her head in her arms and started crying. The sheep behind her looked at her, feeling uneasy as well.
1:2:0|1:2:9|[Yang Liusong] slowly lifted [Lan Tian] up from the ground, and this time he didn't struggle anymore. [Lan Tian] sat up, tears in her eyes as she looked at [Yang Liusong].
1:3:24|1:3:43|Looking at Lan Tian, who was crying loudly, Yang Liusong reached out his hands and held him tightly in his arms, gently patting his back. The scene returned to the desolate desert, this was the fortieth day since Yang Liusong crossed the barrel, at an altitude of 4991 meters.
1:3:43|1:3:53|[Yang Liusong] dug a deep hole in the ground with a small shovel, then scooped out the soil that fell into it. He placed a small basin in the hole and quickly covered it with a raincoat from the side.
1:3:54|1:4:4|[Yang Liusong] tightly held down the raincoat with both hands, picked up a stone that had been prepared earlier, and sprinkled a handful of sand on it, afraid that there would be even the slightest gap.
1:4:4|1:4:19|Finally, he carefully checked the four corners of the package hole to ensure no air leakage. Then, he picked up a stone and broke it in half, gently placing the smaller piece in the middle. After completing all the preparations, [Yang Liusong] clasped his hands together, closed his eyes, and began to pray.
1:4:19|1:4:41|Soon, he returned to the tent, carrying a sleeping bag and a small bag, walking towards the distance. Several weathered but still standing ruins stood tall, while Lan Tian walked in the desert, his steps becoming brisk, the sun overhead becoming more intense, like a burning flame. The air was so hot that it was suffocating, Lan Tian walked in the desert.
1:4:41|1:5:0|As if about to evaporate, it moved forward while looking around in the distance. At this moment, exhausted Lan Tian's legs started to weaken, and walking became unsteady. When it reached the shade behind the ruins, it could no longer hold on, dropped what was in its hands, and lay down on the beach.
1:5:0|1:5:8|As time passed, the sun slowly shifted towards where [Yang Liusong] was sleeping, and the surrounding air became hotter. The heat woke up the sheep lying on the ground.
1:5:9|1:5:29|Lan Tian pushed the clothes away from his face, squinted his eyes, turned sideways, propped up his arms, and climbed up from the ground. He looked around in a daze, and his mind gradually became clear. Soon, he had returned to the place where the tent was set up. Lan Tian looked up at the vast sky, then gradually lowered his head in disappointment.
1:5:29|1:5:33|The extreme thirst and fatigue pressed on Lan Tian's shoulders like two heavy stones.
1:5:34|1:5:48|At this moment, he seemed to remember something and walked quickly towards the tent. Slowly, he even started to run, as if using all his strength. He ran over panting, tightly holding his own water bottle.
1:5:49|1:6:3|One can see him sitting elegantly on the ground, lifting the raincoat that was covering the entrance of the cave. In that moment, he stood still, slowly picking up the small basin placed in the pit, looking at the empty cup, Lan Tian seemed deflated like a balloon.
1:6:3|1:6:15|He lowered his head, sighed deeply, looked helplessly towards the distant sunset, and then dropped the cup in his hand. The afterglow of the sunset was like a fierce battle light, and the sky above seemed to be ablaze.
1:6:15|1:6:31|[Yang Liusong]'s back appeared in the frame, holding a cup to urinate into, collecting the urine in the cup, then raising the cup to look at it before drinking it. [Yang Liusong] didn't dare to drink too much at once, just taking a small sip and stopping.
1:6:31|1:6:43|At night, [Yang Liusong] sat in the tent, turned on a flashlight, and rummaged through his backpack, but there was no surprising discovery inside. He picked up his wallet from the side and took out a one hundred yuan bill.
1:6:43|1:7:0|In the dim light of the flashlight, [Yang Liusong] carefully examined the money, wondering if he was starting to regret not taking more money to buy some food. Now, this essential item has become the most useless thing on the journey.
1:7:0|1:7:4|[Yang Liusong] raised his head and pondered for a moment, looking up at the sky with wide eyes.
1:7:12|1:7:22|He gazed with eager eyes, as if waiting for an answer from the heavens. But apart from the howling cold wind, there was only silence restored by his side.
1:7:23|1:7:41|Early the next morning, a [Big Wolf] quietly entered the tent and stared intently at the sheep sleeping soundly. Just then, the sheep woke up, its lips pale, looking at the huge creature before it. Upon seeing the sheep awake, the [Big Wolf] turned its head away, but its body remained very close.
1:7:41|1:7:44|Yang knew in his heart that even if he wanted to run now, it was already too late.
1:7:45|1:8:3|So, he just lay there motionless, watching the [Big Wolf]. After a while, the [Big Wolf] showed no intention of attacking, instead panting with its tongue out like a dog beside him. He glanced at the sheep when he turned around, then leisurely walked out of the tent.
1:8:3|1:8:13|Yang watched as [Big Wolf] walked away with his tail between his legs, feeling a mix of emotions. Perhaps after spending many days together, they had transformed from being enemies to relying on each other as friends.
1:8:14|1:8:35|Or perhaps these wolves sensed his current hunger and cold, unwilling to miss out on the only meal on the desert. The wolves' figures gradually moved further and further away from him, while the sheep inside the tent still lay quietly there. With a black knitted hat on his head, his face was dark, forming a huge contrast with his pale and cracked lips at this moment.
1:8:35|1:8:37|The scene now returns to before the journey.
1:9:2|1:9:13|Sitting on the side, [Yang Liusong] immediately sat up straight, looking at her with concern. Seeing Lan Tian's smiling face, [Yang Liusong] also smiled and took the bottle of wine from her hand.
1:9:18|1:9:22|[Lan Tian] sighed softly after hearing it, and adjusted the blanket on his legs.
1:10:55|1:11:4|[Lan Tian] tilted his head, looked into [Yang Liusong]'s sincere eyes, nodded silently, and a large tear gathered in the corner of his eye, on the verge of falling.
1:11:37|1:11:47|Yang tilted his head back to drink from the cup, but was choked and frowned. The two sat by the lake.
1:11:55|1:12:2|The lake shimmered with a beautiful luster under the warm sunshine, like a flawless piece of jade.
1:12:26|1:12:40|[Yang Liusong] lowered his head without saying a word, while [Lan Tian] turned to look at him, her eyes filled with reluctance. But when Yang turned his head, he immediately looked away, unwilling to show his vulnerability. Seeing [Lan Tian] forcing a smile, [Yang Liusong] didn't want to say anything more.
1:12:40|1:12:45|He unbuckled his seatbelt and got out of the car, taking out his own bicycle and luggage from the trunk.
1:12:46|1:13:0|Sitting in the car, [Lan Tian] listened to the movement behind the car and involuntarily observed [Yang Liusong] from the rearview mirror. Then, he lowered his head to fasten his seatbelt, while [Yang Liusong] had already ridden his bicycle to the window.
1:13:0|1:13:15|After staring at each other for a long time, [Lan Tian] raised his thumb and smiled at [Yang Liusong]. A cold wind blew in, and the emotions of parting gradually welled up. Yang looked up, gazing into the distance, then turned to look at [Lan Tian] sitting in the car.
1:13:15|1:13:22|Later, he resolutely pushed his bicycle towards another fork in the road, immediately lifted his foot and sat on it, riding towards the path he had chosen.
1:13:23|1:13:39|[Lan Tian] saw the figure of the sheep gradually moving away from him out of the corner of his eye, and then he dared to turn his head to watch his back as he left. After that, he started the car and headed towards another opposite road, but his eyes were unwilling to move away from the sheep's back for a single second.
1:13:39|1:13:51|Afterwards, [Lan Tian] simply parked the car by the roadside and silently watched the figure of Yang riding a bicycle. The desolate mountain peaks were covered in sand and dust, with only the mountain top still retaining a patch of white snow.
1:13:52|1:14:10|On the wide road, Yang lowered his head and pedaled hard on his bicycle, exhaling hot air continuously. He looked ahead at the road, but his mind was already in a mess. At this moment, Yang couldn't help but look back, only to see Lan Tian's car parked in place, motionless.
1:14:10|1:14:26|In the car, [Lan Tian] saw the way Yang turned back and smiled with relief, but soon, the pain of parting swept over [Lan Tian]'s whole body. He lowered his head, placed his hands on the steering wheel, and reminisced about the days they had spent together.
1:14:35|1:14:46|[Lan Tian] couldn't help but start to cry as he thought. Suddenly, he heard a knocking on the car window. He lifted his head abruptly and saw [Yang Liusong] standing outside.
1:14:47|1:15:3|Immediately, he rolled down the car window and looked in astonishment at the panting Yang Liusong. The sunlight above shone through the peaks, illuminating the dark and damp mountain slope, with a faint light floating in the air. At that moment, Yang Liusong appeared on the hillside with Lan Tian on his back.
1:15:3|1:15:13|At this moment, [Lan Tian] obediently lay on [Yang Liusong]'s back, wearing a knitted hat and tightly hugging his neck. [Yang Liusong] carefully watched the deer below, exhaling puffs of hot air from his mouth.
1:15:23|1:15:42|[Yang Liusong] bent down and moved [Lan Tian], who was about to slip, upwards. He then continued to walk forward, panting heavily. After only a few steps, [Yang Liusong] stopped again, deliberately let out a long sigh. This made [Lan Tian] on his back laugh, and he raised his arms and cheered loudly, expressing his joy.
1:15:42|1:16:3|Yang had to bend down again, adjusting his posture, then shouted and headed back to the hillside. Soon, the two arrived at the best spot on the hillside, with [Lan Tian] sitting in front of the tent waving the prayer flags in her hand, while [Yang Liusong] was squatting on the ground adjusting the camera. In the evening, the silhouette of the two sitting side by side appeared on the hillside.
1:16:3|1:16:17|They looked up at the twinkling stars in the sky, enjoying the warmth of each other's company at this moment. As the memories came to an end, [Yang Liusong] turned on the light, revealing his dark face, and then quickly turned it off again, with the sound of [Lan Tian]'s voice echoing in his ears.
1:16:39|1:16:58|[Yang Liusong] woke up in a daze once again, only to find that it was already the next morning. His face, exposed to the wind and sun, had started to peel in large patches, and his severely dehydrated lips had dry skin peeling off. He then slowly picked up the cup beside him, looking at the sparse urine inside with a vacant expression.
1:17:5|1:17:24|The extreme lack of water in his body quickly dispelled any wandering thoughts. [Yang Liusong] took out the clip from his mouth, but at this moment, his inner struggle began again. Soon, as if remembering something, his eyes suddenly lit up. Then, he struggled to sit up and looked eagerly at the water cup like a lizard.
1:17:24|1:17:42|The strong desire to survive broke his last bit of stubbornness. [Yang Liusong]'s eyes stared blankly at the water source that could keep him alive. At this moment, without any hesitation, he reached out and grabbed the cup lid. As his fingers turned, the lid also turned and was soon opened.
1:17:43|1:17:55|Looking at the small amount of urine in the cup, [Yang Liusong] felt the fire in his throat and couldn't help but salivate. He brought the cup closer to his lips, but the strange smell caused discomfort in his body.
1:17:55|1:18:12|After a bout of retching, [Yang Liusong] struggled to swallow the acidic water rising in his stomach. Taking a deep breath, he gradually calmed his rapid breathing. Looking at the urine in the cup, a strong odor hit him. With no choice, he held his breath and immediately drank it down.
1:18:21|1:18:38|[Yang Liusong], who cherished the only water source immensely, was caught off guard as it was unexpectedly spit out due to uncontrollable factors. Just as he closed his eyes to take a breather, the white blood on the ground instantly woke him up. Looking around, [Yang Liusong] couldn't believe his eyes for a moment.
1:19:12|1:19:19|Looking around at the snow-covered plains and mountains, the flame of hope that had been extinguished was once again ignited.
1:19:44|1:19:53|At this moment, [Yang Liusong] felt his whole body filled with vitality, riding his bicycle in the snow, shouting with joy.
1:19:53|1:20:6|In the distance, the deer grazing in fear, constantly moving their ears to observe. As far as the eye can see, there is an endless expanse of snow, with scattered patches of dry grass, only revealing their true appearance at this moment.
1:20:6|1:20:23|[Yang Liusong] has packed up his luggage, climbed up the road that cuts through the barrel, and the bicycle tires left crooked marks on the ground. The silhouette of [Yang Liusong] riding the bicycle also gained a bit of heroism. Ahead, the short white snow-capped peaks pierce the sky, and the treasures like green sand linger in the sky.
1:20:23|1:20:28|These days of hardship have left [Yang Liusong] with a feeling of having a second chance at life.
1:20:57|1:21:18|Time flies, today marks the fifty-fifth day in Hengchuan Qiangtang. Lan Tian finds himself at an altitude of 4,998 meters. He shakes his wet clothes and hangs them on the ground, then sits down and rolls up his pants. Suddenly, a stream of water rushes down from above.
1:21:18|1:21:31|With his back turned, [Yang Liusong] didn't notice at all. The water flow became faster and faster, until it reached [Yang Liusong]'s feet. He suddenly stood up, quickly turned around, and threw the luggage that had already been soaked in water to the other side.
1:21:32|1:21:51|On the side, the bicycle was still lying on the ground, [Yang Liusong] hurried over to the bicycle, then caught sight of the tent soaking in the water, immediately turned around and picked up the tent, throwing it onto the dry ground. Then, he ran back to the bicycle and lifted it up from the ground.
1:21:51|1:22:2|Immediately grasping the handrail, [Yang Liusong] walked towards the relatively dry bank. Thinking everything was fine, he lowered his head to look around and only then did he realize that the clothes he had just hung out to dry were wet again.
1:22:17|1:22:35|The flood on the Gobi Desert was spreading rapidly, with no shelter around. [Yang Liusong] struggled to move forward on his bicycle, the water already up to his waist. He exerted force to push the bicycle forward, but his body was unable to move against the resistance of the water.
1:22:35|1:22:48|[Yang] leaned forward stubbornly, pushed hard, and lost his balance, falling backwards. The bicycle with luggage also fell down, so [Yang] had to drag the bicycle laboriously and head towards the shore with difficulty.
1:22:56|1:23:15|The overflowing snowmelt turned the vast desert into a rushing river, and helpless [Yang] was rapidly retreating in the direction of the flowing river. At this moment, the water was already above his shoulders, so [Yang] had to stretch his hand upward with great effort, dragging the car to accelerate towards the shore.
1:23:15|1:23:21|Persistence pays off. Several hours later, [Yang] finally arrived at a place where the water flow was relatively calm.
1:23:22|1:23:34|He sat exhausted on the wheel of his bicycle, looking up and taking a deep breath. After a short rest, he stood up, laboriously lifted the bicycle, and slowly walked towards the shore.
1:23:34|1:23:45|Not long after, he safely reached the river bank. Exhausted, [Yang] casually pushed his bicycle aside and collapsed, lying flat on the shore. However, cries for help from wolf cubs could be heard from across the river.
1:23:58|1:24:12|Yang turned around and saw the pitiful look of the [Big Wolf] cub, feeling a bit sorry for it. He stood up, looked at the swift water around him, and felt even more troubled. In the evening, a bright moon hung in the sky, emitting a cold and eerie light.
1:24:12|1:24:28|Curled up in the tent, Lan Tian had a small kerosene lamp lit at his feet. He kept rubbing his feet and legs with his hands, shivering all over. The emergency light above emitted a faint glow as he looked up ahead, as if contemplating something.
1:24:28|1:24:37|He then turned his eyes to the windproof bag placed on the side, which contained half a bag of blood. He couldn't help but reach out and pick it up, slowly moving it to his side.
1:24:54|1:25:13|[Yang Liusong] opened the wind pocket and took a look, then looked ahead and stopped his movements. After pondering for a while, the last defense line in his heart was defeated by the twists and turns of the day. He slowly reached into the bag, carefully grabbed a handful of blood, and ate it with a wide open mouth.
1:25:24|1:25:41|After Lan Tian took a bite, he gradually lost control, reaching out to grab handfuls after handfuls, continuously stuffing them into his mouth.
1:25:41|1:26:4|Despite being choked and coughing continuously, Lan Tian's mouth kept chewing, the pleasure of eating brought him an unprecedented satisfaction. But soon, his eyes gradually dimmed, and the chewing slowed down. He gradually realized a serious problem.
1:26:4|1:26:9|The next morning, [Yang Liusong] was in the tent, holding a compressed biscuit in his hand.
1:26:10|1:26:28|Bowing his head and quickly devouring the food, eating voraciously, even licking the crumbs in his hand clean, but soon, his expression changed, raising his hand to fan his mouth. [Yang Liusong] sat there full of regret, unable to control his body.
1:26:34|1:26:49|Outside the tent, the floodwaters surged with a menacing warning sound. On the high ground where [Yang Liusong] was located, there was only a small space left to pitch the tent. If they stayed in place without moving, they would soon face the risk of being washed away.
1:26:49|1:27:1|[Yang Liusong] squatted on the side for a moment, immediately took off his pants, carried the big and small bags, and slowly walked towards the rolling river. He was seen holding two trekking poles, stepping cautiously and carefully with each step.
1:27:2|1:27:11|In the middle of the river, the water became increasingly turbulent. [Yang Liusong]'s lower body was completely soaked in water, and the backpacks on his body were all destined to be submerged.
1:27:12|1:27:24|Each step in the water was exceptionally difficult, and [Yang Liusong]'s expression became fierce due to exerting too much force. But the next second, he was swept back by the water flow because he couldn't stand firm.
1:27:24|1:27:33|A few hours later, [Yang Liusong]'s figure reappeared in the waves, with the front of the bike on his shoulder, striding forward against the current.
1:27:39|1:27:53|At this moment, [Yang Liusong], who successfully reached the opposite bank, put on a down jacket and anxiously rubbed his exposed thighs with his hands, unable to stop moving in place, while the [Big Wolf] let out a lonely whimper in its original location.
1:27:53|1:27:59|[Yang Liusong] took a glance at the [Big Wolf] that had been with him for days, sighed, gritted his teeth, and took off his down jacket again.
1:28:10|1:28:28|Soon, [Yang Liusong] had packed up his belongings and was walking on the high ground untouched by the flood. [Big Wolf] obediently followed behind him. At that moment, [Yang Liusong] suddenly turned around and looked at [Big Wolf]. Startled, [Big Wolf] took a few steps back, but continued to stare at him.
1:28:28|1:28:36|[Yang Liusong] gave him a white look, then turned around and pushed his bicycle forward. The naive little wolf slowed down and secretly followed behind him.
1:28:37|1:28:56|[Yang Liusong] quickened his pace and the wolf cub following behind also hastened. Suddenly, a dark shadow flew over [Yang Liusong]'s head. Perplexed, he looked up and saw an eagle circling in the sky. He turned to look at the wolf cub, but at that moment, the eagle swooped down.
1:28:56|1:29:3|Sensing the danger, [Little Wolf] hurriedly ran back. Lan Tian pushed the car and quickly picked up a few stones to throw at the eagle.
1:29:11|1:29:26|The eagle was scared away, and the sheep looked at the frightened [Little Wolf] with some sympathy. When [Little Wolf] saw it stop, it was no longer afraid, obediently lying on the ground, tilting its head to look at it. Time passed quickly, gone in the blink of an eye, and came quickly as well.
1:29:26|1:29:38|Today marks the sixty-fourth day of Lan Tian's deep exploration into the uninhabited area, at an altitude of 4,997 meters. At this moment, Yang Liusong is running around Lan, playfully biting the straps of her backpack.
1:29:50|1:29:58|Yang Liusong, with a worried look on his face, plays with Lan Tian. Little Wolf sensibly walks away, and he comes to the grassy area alone, occasionally looking into the distance.
1:29:59|1:30:17|A groundhog suddenly popped out of the hole next to them. The timid [Lan Tian] immediately ran backwards. The two groundhogs on the open ground hugged each other in a stalemate, even standing up together, trying to show off their abilities. They both grabbed each other's napes, not daring to relax at all.
1:30:17|1:30:28|[Little Wolf] wanted to watch the excitement, but was scared of the groundhog poking its head out, so he quickly ran back towards the tent set up by [Yang Liusong]. At this moment, [Yang Liusong] was sitting on the ground, looking ahead.
1:31:2|1:31:13|[Yang Liusong] pushed the heavily loaded bicycle, while [Xiao Lang] obediently stayed in the backpack with a little head peeking out. In the distance, a group of camels curiously stared at the passing [Yang Liusong].
1:31:13|1:31:24|In the vast desert, variously shaped mounds and small hills stand tall, giving the barren land a sense of grandeur when viewed from above. The figure of [Yang Liusong] is enveloped in this scenic beauty.
1:31:25|1:31:37|Slowly moving forward, passing by the corpses of yaks scattered around, it's a bit frightening. Today is the 65th day of the journey, and the altitude is at 4987 meters.
1:31:37|1:31:47|[Yang Liusong] knelt by the shore, gently scooping up a cup of water, but it still looked murky. He frowned, his face showing a hint of blue. At that moment, [Lan Tian] on the side suddenly howled.
1:31:52|1:32:7|[Yang Liusong] felt something was wrong, he looked up at the sea, and what he saw made his pupils dilate gradually. A wall of dark clouds connected heaven and earth, and a spiral water column rose from the sea. At this moment, the tornado moved faster and faster, heading straight towards the coast.
1:32:8|1:32:20|[Yang Liusong] stood still, his eyes following the direction of the tornado as it moved. A huge rotating funnel formed by the water waves was roaring towards the center, sweeping up the sand and wind from the shore.
1:32:20|1:32:39|[Yang Liusong] stood still, watching the incredibly destructive force of the massive tornado. Suddenly, he remembered his tent and bicycle behind him being blown away in an instant. The tornado was already approaching at lightning speed. Frantically, [Yang Liusong] tried to speed up, but he could only watch helplessly as his belongings were sucked into the vortex.
1:32:40|1:32:45|Before he could react, the massive tornado rushed towards [Yang Liusong] crazily.
1:32:48|1:33:1|Despite the sandstorm raised by [Yang Liusong] blurring his vision, he still exerted all his strength and ran forward with all his might. However, soon [Yang Liusong] was engulfed by the swirling yellow sand all around, and he was swept into the vortex.
1:33:1|1:33:6|[Yang Liusong] loses consciousness, feeling as if falling into the deep sea, slowly sinking to the bottom.
1:33:7|1:33:23|The faint light above gradually darkened, and at that moment, he subconsciously recalled the day he bid farewell to [Lan Tian]. Sitting in the car, [Lan Tian] smiled and looked at him through the rolled-down window, while the setting sun on the opposite side shone brightly, reflecting on his handsome face.
1:33:23|1:33:38|[Yang Liusong] stood in front of the car window, looking at her reluctantly, but his throat seemed to be blocked and he couldn't say a word. [Lan Tian] stared at her for a long time, then picked up the camera beside him and dropped it. [Yang Liusong] lowered his head and looked at the camera in silence.
1:33:44|1:33:48|[Yang Liusong] holds the camera in his hands, with guidance from [Lan Tian].
1:33:51|1:34:6|[Lan Tian] expressed her concern in a gentle way, which made [Yang Liusong] feel a warm surge in his heart. He smiled at [Lan Tian] and then rode his bike towards the direction of the shooting range. Inside the car, [Lan Tian] clasped her hands together, closed her eyes with a worried expression, and prayed.
1:34:6|1:34:12|Yang Liusong's figure gradually moved further and further away from him, Lan Tian looked at his back and squeezed out a smile.
1:34:24|1:34:44|At this moment, the sheep about to fall into the sea seemed to hear the call from [Lan Tian]'s heart. It stretched out its arms desperately, swimming upwards continuously, striving towards the light at the top. The scene shifts back to the real world, the familiar vast desert appears once again. The sheep, facing downwards, lies motionless on the sand.
1:34:44|1:34:52|After a while, Lan Tian gradually regained consciousness, rolled over and got up from the ground. Sand from his clothes and backpack kept spilling out as he stood up.
1:34:53|1:34:58|He squinted and turned to look back, only to see Lan Tian not far away, staring at him intently.
1:35:8|1:35:26|As dusk approached, the sky suddenly darkened, and a group of horses in the distance seemed to be running forward as if being chased. Beyond the rolling hills, a herd of yaks was lining up to move towards another higher hill. Looking into the distance, everywhere was filled with sand dunes piled up in a golden hue.
1:35:27|1:35:42|Countless folds of sand and stones surged like frozen waves, extending all the way to the distant horizon where it met the sky. It was impossible to imagine where the end of the sand was. What remained unchanged was that Lan Tian still followed closely behind the sheep.
1:35:57|1:36:15|The wild geese call out as they fly through the sky, heading towards the distant freedom. Exhausted sheep lie on the ground, looking at the vast sky. The surrounding area, washed away by the flood, has turned into a muddy swamp. The sheep's eyes are empty, unsure if they can still walk out of this desolate land.
1:36:15|1:36:27|His face became even darker and rougher due to the blowing sand. He tightly gripped the only remaining climbing pole in his hand. At this moment, the hungry [Lan Tian] also began to feel his heart beating rapidly.
1:36:32|1:36:48|[Lan Tian] sat in a wheelchair, looking at a map with a route marked across the Qiangtang Plateau, estimated to take 80 days. What [Yang Liusong] was going through at this moment, [Lan Tian] had no idea. All he could do was silently pray for the day when [Yang Liusong] would return safely.
1:36:54|1:37:12|Today is the 69th day of crossing through Qiangtang, located at an altitude of 5428 meters. [Yang] leans on a trekking pole, limping along the edge of the sandy cliff. The cliff reveals neat horizontal stripes, showcasing the extraordinary craftsmanship of nature.
1:37:13|1:37:35|[Big Wolf] then revealed a head, staring behind [Sheep]. Under the thin ice on the river, several fish were swimming around freely. [Sheep] lay on the side, holding a stone in his hand, pounding the ice surface again and again. The faint thumping sound scared the fish at the bottom of the sea to swim around in panic.
1:37:35|1:37:42|[Yang Liusong] still maintained his original posture, continuously striking the ice surface, paying no attention to the ice chips splashing all over his face.
1:37:54|1:38:10|[Yang Liusong] was exhausted and out of breath, unable to lift another stone. He used his hands to clear away the fallen ice debris, only to find his efforts futile against the thick ice layer. [Little Wolf] stood by, emitting pitiful whimpers from its mouth.
1:38:10|1:38:23|Reluctantly, [Yang Liusong] had to set off again with [Xiao Lang], only to be greeted by an even steeper downhill slope after climbing over the hill. [He] leaned on the trekking pole with one hand, moving his feet slowly while leaning to the side.
1:38:23|1:38:40|The wolf cub stayed peacefully in the backpack, swaying with Lan Tian's trembling body. Lan Tian, who hadn't eaten for days, felt as if he was stepping on cotton and couldn't exert any strength. With a moment of carelessness, his legs went weak and he stumbled down the hill.
1:38:40|1:38:58|The scene before their eyes once again brought despair. The endless desert stretched out like a copy and paste. It was the seventy-fourth day of crossing through Qiangtang, at an altitude of 4,557 meters, [Yang Liusong] squinted his eyes and looked ahead with a dry mouth.
1:38:58|1:39:9|It could no longer hold on, and knelt down on the ground. [Big Wolf] stuck out its tongue and panted, also silently stopping. A gust of cold wind blew by, making the scattered hair on both sides even more messy.
1:39:9|1:39:23|[Yang Liusong] licked his chapped lips, occasionally lifting his heavy eyelids to look ahead. The cute little wolf cub beside him rubbed against his sleeve, acting coquettishly. [Yang Liusong] reached out and held the cub in his arms, gently embracing it.
1:39:24|1:39:41|The wolf cub happily licked the lamb's wrist, stuck out its tongue, and panted with hot breath. The lamb lowered its head and looked at the wolf cub, its eyes suddenly becoming unusually determined, with layers of sand flows decorating the endless desert. With their tenacious perseverance, they rooted deeply in the sandy soil, struggling to survive.
1:39:42|1:39:54|[Yang Liusong] no longer hesitated, stood up with his trekking pole, and set off again. The night sky wiped away the last trace of the setting sun, and the night fell slowly like a curtain in a theater.
1:39:54|1:40:4|[Yang Liusong] used an electric baton to ignite a pile of willow bushes. In the flickering firelight, his face became intermittently bright and dark. From a distance, [Big Wolf] watched the burning willow bushes with a hint of curiosity.
1:40:5|1:40:23|For days of starvation had left him dizzy and disoriented, as he turned to look at the young wolf cub by the fire, a terrible desire arose within him. It was already the seventy-fifth day, and at this moment, Lan Tian leaned on his climbing stick, hobbling towards the towering sand dunes.
1:40:23|1:40:35|He was exhausted, his legs gave out and he knelt on the sandy ground, panting heavily. When Little Wolf saw this, he immediately ran over, making a distressed whimpering sound, but Lan Tian picked up a trekking pole and struck him.
1:40:57|1:41:17|A gust of cold wind swept in, lifting the fine sand on the ground. [Lan Tian] continued to support himself with the climbing stick, trembling as he walked forward. Despite the violent obstruction, [Yang Liusong] still followed closely behind. As the day turned into dusk, countless sand waves surged, folds resembling frozen waves, extending all the way to the distant horizon.
1:41:17|1:41:20|At this moment, the shadows of a pack of wolves appeared on the mountain peaks behind them.
1:41:40|1:41:59|Yang, hungry for days and nights, dragged his almost falling apart body slower and slower, with the [Big Wolf] silently following beside him. Today is the 76th day of the journey, at an altitude of 4550 meters. At this moment, Yang can no longer hold on, he lowers his head, gradually losing consciousness.
1:41:59|1:42:2|Twinkling stars of the Milky Way appear in Lan Tian's mind.
1:42:3|1:42:21|At this moment, he felt a warmth in his hand, and he opened his eyes drowsily. A slender hand gently interlocked fingers with his index finger. Yang couldn't help but turn his head to look to the side, only to find Lan Tian holding his hand lying beside him, with a warm smile on her face.
1:42:21|1:42:27|Lying on the side, Lan Tian looked at the familiar face with a trance, at this moment, he felt choked up and couldn't say a word.
1:42:28|1:42:42|[Lan Tian], dressed in unusual attire, smiled at her and then turned to look at the Milky Way scattered across the sky. Soon, her eyes became extremely sad, and then she took a deep breath and said.
1:43:46|1:43:57|[Lan Tian]'s eyes were shining when he spoke, with a look of longing for freedom. He gazed at the starry sky above his head, then a smile of relief appeared at the corner of his mouth.
1:44:1|1:44:25|Following that, he closed his eyes contentedly, accompanied by the warmth in his hands. Beside him, [Lan Tian] opened her arms with a smile of happiness on her face. The two held hands and lay under the brilliant Milky Way, their figures gradually becoming more and more distant, until the scene slowly faded into complete darkness.
1:44:25|1:44:38|Suddenly, dark clouds covered the sky, lightning bolts split the air, as if there was a force ready to devour the world. [Little Wolf] was awakened by the deafening thunder, but quickly tilted his head and fell back asleep.
1:44:45|1:45:3|A group of wolves ran towards them like mad, while the sheep lying on the ground remained motionless. Sensing something unusual, Lan Tian immediately woke up, but the sheep, holding the whistle, still showed no response. He hurriedly ran to the sheep's side, trying to wake it up.
1:45:35|1:45:41|In the early morning, the sand dunes remained silent as usual under the sunlight, vast and endless.
1:45:41|1:46:2|After billions of years of precipitation and tribulations, he calmly watched all the changes and the flow of narratives, transcending the world, as the grains of sand under the scorching sun emitted a hint of heat. He also looked out, as if the yellow sand beneath his feet was drifting with a faint and continuous heat wave, the struggle against the harsh cold and hunger in the desert for seventy-seven days.
1:46:2|1:46:9|Before stepping into this unpredictable land, he had no idea if this would be a journey of no return.
1:46:10|1:46:25|In front of the inn, [Lan Tian] sits in a wheelchair, as if he has been waiting for a long time. He is dressed in a straightjacket, stands up from the wheelchair, walks out of the door, and stands on the steps. The sunlight shines on his bright face, but he can't help but raise his hand to shield it.
1:46:25|1:46:31|As the camera zooms in, he slowly reaches out his other hand, bends down, and reveals a sweet smile.
1:46:32|1:46:46|The sunlight gradually warms up, touching everything in the world, and the wind in the sky also starts to become gentle, no longer carrying the infinite chill as it brushes past, and [Lan Tian]'s face gradually disappears under the brilliance of the sun.
1:46:46|1:46:54|In the lingering sunset, the figure of [Lan Tian] leaping and jumping gradually emerges, with [Yang Liusong] watching him, leaning on a trekking pole and jumping backwards.
1:46:55|1:47:9|His flowing medium-length hair was blown behind his ears, and the sand on the ground kept rising with his every step. Later, he lay on the sandy ground covered with willow bushes, holding [Little Wolf] in his arms, pouting his lips, pretending to howl.
1:47:9|1:47:20|[Little Wolf] at this moment became interested, vigorously raised his head and opened his mouth wide, letting out a heart-wrenching howl, a howl filled with sorrow, while [Yang Liusong] had a look of relief on his face.
1:47:21|1:47:40|In 2010, [Yang Liusong] attempted to hike in the uninhabited area of Hengchuan Qiangtang for the first time. In 2014, [Li Congming] went missing while in the uninhabited area of Hengchuan Qiangtang at Kokoxili. In 2016, [Wu Wanjiang] completed the Hengchuan route in the uninhabited area of Qiangtang for the first time after 52 days.
1:47:41|1:47:46|One person, one bicycle, one tent, crossing the Qiangtang Plateau for seventy-seven days.
