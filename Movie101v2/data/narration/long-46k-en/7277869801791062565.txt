0:1:1|0:1:12|The protagonist [Na Na] is a little girl who has just been diagnosed with leukemia. Her mother [Fei Mei] is taking her to the hospital for tests. The quiet corridor is only occupied by the mother and daughter, while the hospital rooms are filled with children undergoing treatment.
0:1:15|0:1:34|The milder cases can read books and play games, while the more severe cases can only lie in bed, finding it difficult even to breathe. Doctors and nurses are also patrolling the ward, constantly monitoring their condition. At this moment, a bald kid with glasses is walking towards them.
0:1:44|0:1:58|[Na Na] couldn't help but turn around to look, her eyes full of curiosity. This was the first friend she had met in this hospital who actively talked to her. At night, [Na Na] sat in front of the mirror in an exquisite princess dress, combing her hair.
0:1:58|0:2:11|Unexpectedly, at the critical moment, she encountered trouble. She combed hard, looked down at the comb, and found a large amount of hair tangled on it. She looked incredulously at the mirror, only to see herself in the mirror had become bald.
0:2:13|0:2:16|He woke up from the dream, feeling scared as he touched his own head.
0:2:41|0:2:59|In order for [Na Na] to recover smoothly, [Fei Mei] sent her to the hospital. At this time, [Na Na] was just like all the other children in the hospital, with shaved heads, becoming a little baldie. She quickly integrated into the group, playing games with the other children on the sickbed, appearing no different from healthy kids.
0:2:59|0:3:5|However, the child whose condition is more serious than hers can only lie on the hospital bed in pain with needles inserted.
0:3:13|0:3:21|The child wearing glasses and a skirt is called Si Han. He got out of bed and with the help of the nurse, sat in a wheelchair.
0:3:26|0:3:29|Nana was momentarily puzzled by Sihan's words.
0:3:34|0:3:41|Nan Fang's departure caught the attention of the other children, who watched the direction she left with a hint of anticipation in their eyes.
0:3:43|0:3:58|Si Han sat in the hyperopia room with a mask on, the nurse inserted the needle for her, adjusted the equipment, and after a few instructions, left. [Na Na] tiptoed to the window and peeked, watching the nurse who had just come out from inside, her face full of curiosity but too afraid to ask.
0:3:58|0:4:17|After the nurse left, she shifted her gaze back to focus on the deeply myopic Si Han. Unfortunately, the window was too high, and even on tiptoes, she could only see half of his head. Outside the window, the streetlights flickered as the man woke up on the train bunk. [Fei Mei] and [Da Peng] arrived at the hospital to see the doctor and inquire about their daughter's condition.
0:4:19|0:4:34|[Na Na]'s condition is actually getting worse. Both of them were heartbroken to learn how serious Na Na's condition was. What the doctor said next brought hope to Na Na.
0:4:57|0:5:3|Watching [Na Na] lying unconscious on the hospital bed, [Da Peng] contemplated for a moment before suggesting to donate his bone marrow to save her.
0:6:7|0:6:24|A single word gave [Da Peng] hope, as he stared at [Fei Mei], waiting for her answer. However, [Fei Mei] hesitated, unable to make a decision. But thinking of [Na Na] lying in the hospital bed, she had to make a choice. At that moment, [Da Peng] uttered the crucial question.
0:6:24|0:6:28|[Fei Mei] was initially in a panic, but quickly calmed down.
0:6:31|0:6:37|Even if unwilling, one cannot risk their daughter's life. How to approach the ex-husband has become a new challenge.
0:6:39|0:6:47|At this moment on the train, Nan Fang also tossed and turned, unable to sleep all night. He was the only one in the train compartment, but his heart just couldn't calm down.
0:6:49|0:7:7|He rolled out of bed, opened the door and swayed through the corridor to the bathroom. Leaning against the wall behind the door, he lit a cigarette for himself. The heavy heart seemed to only find relief in the cigarette. Under the influence of nicotine, he finally found a moment of relaxation.
0:7:7|0:7:23|Looking at himself shrouded in smoke in the mirror, he fell into memories, thinking of his fianc√©e [Meng Meng]. He remembered the night before he left, [Meng Meng] was in the room sorting out clothes, holding that checkered shirt, looking down in silence, with a sad expression.
0:7:23|0:7:38|Sensing the presence of [Nan Fang], she immediately adjusted her emotions and pretended nothing had happened. But how could [Nan Fang] not notice her abnormality? She hugged [Meng Meng] from behind and comforted her softly.
0:7:49|0:7:55|[Wang Meng] commented for a moment, then continued to tidy up without saying a word. Looking at the indifferent [Wang Meng], the man looked guilty.
0:8:4|0:8:20|[Nan Fang] these words are undoubtedly a reassurance to [Meng Meng], she looked at [Nan Fang] and said. The two embraced affectionately and bid farewell. Fast forward to the present, [Nan Fang] stood at the door smoking all night.
0:8:20|0:8:26|She took out her wallet, intending to take out money but was attracted by a photo in the middle layer, which was of [Na Na].
0:8:29|0:8:48|Looking at the beautiful and lovely [Na Na], she showed a brief smile, which was soon replaced by bitterness. [Na Na]'s illness deprived her of happiness. In order to save [Na Na], her prepared wedding with [Meng Meng] was also forced to be canceled. Thinking of [Meng Meng], she remembered the sweet time when the two of them took wedding photos together.
0:8:48|0:8:57|Dressed in an exquisite wedding dress, [Meng Meng] looks elegant and noble, and the couple looks perfect together. Facing the camera, the smile on their faces is a testimony to their love.
0:8:59|0:9:19|During the wedding photoshoot, they were filled with joy, looking forward to a beautiful future together. They changed into different outfits, posed affectionately, all to capture the best memories. At that time, he would attentively help Meng Meng adjust her clothes, and couldn't help but be moved by the beautiful Meng Meng in the mirror.
0:9:19|0:9:28|The sweet memories of the two are vivid, but unfortunately, everything is ready, but the wedding did not take place as scheduled. The original close companionship has turned into a thousand miles apart.
0:9:30|0:9:46|Watching the disappointed look in [Meng Meng]'s eyes, [Nan Fang] felt a deep sense of self-blame. She sat in the car, looking at the scenery outside, her heart filled with mixed emotions. In reality, [Meng Meng] was conflicted about [Nan Fang]'s departure, but she couldn't tell her, nor could she show it.
0:9:52|0:10:6|Before setting off in the taxi, Meng Meng was lost in thought, unsure of how to speak to Nan Fang. The two did not communicate throughout the journey, making the atmosphere awkward. Nan Fang's indifferent attitude also left Meng Meng feeling very disappointed.
0:10:20|0:10:38|After Meng Meng asked Nan Fang to escort her to the carriage, she turned and left. Nan Fang quickly caught up and escorted her out of the crowded carriage. The two bid farewell on the platform, and only as the train was about to depart did they reluctantly part ways. Meng Meng's inner reluctance could no longer be contained, they gazed deeply into each other's eyes and embraced tightly.
0:10:38|0:10:44|The previous unhappiness has long been forgotten, and the love between the two is expressed at this moment.
0:10:45|0:10:59|Nan Fang's kiss to Hang Ruowuren is the best proof of their love. Meng Meng's inner confusion and entanglement also disappear with it. The man's actions show his intentions to her, surpassing a thousand words. She can also rest assured and let him go save Na Na.
0:11:1|0:11:7|As soon as she turned around, [Nan Fang] grabbed her arm and led her towards the carriage.
0:11:19|0:11:23|At this moment, [Meng Meng] is sleeping soundly on the train, while [Nan Fang] looks at her affectionately.
0:11:54|0:12:9|He took the water cup handed by [Da Peng], slowly got up and leaned on the sofa to drink. Luckily, with [Da Peng] by his side, taking care of him all the time. Seeing [Fei Mei] looking exhausted, [Da Peng] finally expressed his thoughts.
0:12:12|0:12:22|Listening to [Da Peng]'s suggestion, [Fei Mei] remained silent. He put down the water glass and said to her. [Fei Mei] stayed silent, turning her head to look at him quietly.
0:12:25|0:12:37|[Da Peng] hesitated for a moment with a dodging look in his eyes, pretending to speak calmly. "Na Na is so cute," [Fei Mei] sighed deeply upon hearing her husband's comments about the other party, reminiscing about the past.
0:12:43|0:12:49|She stood up and touched the photo of [Na Na] on the cabinet, after a moment of contemplation, she turned to [Da Peng] behind her and said.
0:12:55|0:13:2|Seeing [Fei Mei] feeling sad and upset, [Da Peng] was at a loss for words on how to comfort her, but he truly wanted to save [Na Na].
0:13:4|0:13:9|Thinking of [Na Na], [Da Peng] felt sorry, but unexpectedly [Fei Mei] misunderstood.
0:13:22|0:13:32|[Fei Mei]'s sudden change in attitude left [Da Peng] momentarily puzzled, but she understood the inner struggles and concerns of [Fei Mei]. She sincerely hoped that [Na Na] could recover.
0:13:32|0:13:47|Facing Fei Mei's question again, Da Peng couldn't answer for a moment, but she was certain that she truly liked Na Na. If her selfishness led to Na Na's death, she would definitely not want to see that happen. Meanwhile, Nan Fang and Meng Meng have successfully arrived in Beijing.
0:13:49|0:13:55|Watching [Meng Meng], who has been with her through all the ups and downs, the man feels very sorry for her, but it's [Na Na] who urgently needs surgery that worries her the most.
0:13:57|0:14:11|On the highway, [Da Peng] is driving to pick up [Nan Fang]. Only by successfully picking up [Nan Fang], can we be one step closer to [Na Na]'s recovery. [Fei Mei] sits silently in the passenger seat, knowing that [Nan Fang]'s arrival brings both hope and disappointment.
0:14:11|0:14:19|The atmosphere between the two in the car suddenly became heavy, [Fei Mei] couldn't help but look at [Da Peng], seeking comfort as much as worry.
0:14:50|0:15:7|[Da Peng]'s gentle words gave [Fei Mei] confidence, watching her enter the hospital. [Da Peng] was worried and helpless. The hospital was crowded, with the elevator surrounded inside and out. [Fei Mei] was squeezed to the outside, completely unaware of [Nan Fang] and [Meng Meng] inside.
0:15:7|0:15:25|[Nan Fang] stared at the closed elevator door, frowning, while [Meng Meng] looked at her. It wasn't until [Meng Meng] softly reminded her that she snapped out of it. Just as the two entered the elevator, they were squeezed to the back. Finally finding a spot, they looked up and saw [Fei Mei] standing at the elevator entrance.
0:15:25|0:15:30|The man was momentarily stunned, and [Meng Meng] followed his gaze, only to see [Fei Mei].
0:15:31|0:15:47|[Fei Mei] was stunned, the person behind her couldn't wait and started urging her. [Fei Mei] saw the two of them reluctantly getting on the elevator. When the elevator reached the floor, [Fei Mei] immediately walked away quickly. [Nan Fang] led [Meng Meng] through the crowd closely behind.
0:15:47|0:15:56|At a deserted corner of the corridor, [Nan Fang] and [Fei Mei] meet for the first time. The three of them feel a bit awkward, and [Nan Fang] immediately introduces [Meng Meng] to [Fei Mei].
0:16:7|0:16:18|Fei Mei listened and then turned to walk towards the pediatric ward, and then said to [Nan Fang]. Fei Mei's sudden proposal left [Nan Fang] feeling a bit bewildered.
0:16:23|0:16:27|Fei Mei took the money, looking melancholic, and then raised a new question.
0:16:35|0:16:52|At this moment, in the car, Nan Fang, waiting for Fei Mei, was reading a newspaper. Nan Fang put down the newspaper, hesitated for a moment, then picked up the phone and answered it. Upon finding the ward, Nan Fang quickly pushed open the door. Unexpectedly, the scene in front of him left him stunned.
0:16:52|0:17:10|At this moment, [Na Na] was lying obediently on the hospital bed reading a book, and [Nan Fang] caught sight of her. [Na Na] quickly sat up and looked in the direction of the sound. [Nan Fang] dropped his luggage, rushed to the bedside in a big stride, and embraced [Na Na] tightly. The father and daughter hugged each other closely, with [Nan Fang] showing deep concern.
0:17:18|0:17:30|Upon hearing [Na Na]'s sincere response, the man's heart was twisted like a knife, and he quickly embraced [Na Na] to comfort her. Outside the ward, [Meng Meng] also saw everything clearly between the father and daughter.
0:17:44|0:17:47|Upon hearing Nan Fang's call, Meng Meng's face lit up with joy as she quickly walked into the hospital room.
0:17:57|0:18:17|However, [Na Na] was not happy to hear the praise from [Fei Mei]. She looked disappointedly at her father, but he didn't understand. The man and [Fei Mei] looked at each other in confusion. At that moment, [Na Na] took out a hat from the bedside and put it on her head. Meanwhile, outside the ward, [Fei Mei] was making a phone call.
0:18:23|0:18:27|[Fei Mei] walked into the ward and saw the three of them having a harmonious time.
0:18:33|0:18:40|Upon seeing [Fei Mei] enter, the two immediately stood up and gave up their seats. [Meng Meng] smiled and gently struck up a conversation with [Fei Mei].
0:18:42|0:18:45|[Na Na] looked at [Fei Mei] with a happy expression on her face.
0:18:59|0:19:18|[Fei Mei] considerately puts a mask on [Na Na], while [Meng Meng] can only smile awkwardly at the situation. It's lunchtime.
0:19:41|0:19:48|[Na Na]'s innocent thoughts are hard to refuse, while [Meng Meng] smiles without saying a word, falling into an awkward situation.
0:20:3|0:20:21|[Na Na]'s words made [Meng Meng] feel extremely sad. She watched [Fei Mei], who had a gentle expression, lost in thought. Sensing her gaze, [Fei Mei] quickly hid her smile. The innocent [Na Na] didn't notice anything unusual, and prepared to get off the bed to put on her shoes and go home. [Na Na] grabbed her dad and mom's hands, ready to head home.
0:20:21|0:20:25|Not long after she started walking, a familiar figure appeared at the door, causing her to stop in her tracks.
0:20:38|0:20:40|[Da Peng] answered [Na Na] with a smile on his face.
0:20:45|0:20:54|[Da Peng] felt unhappy in his heart, but didn't say anything. [Nan Fang] picked up [Na Na] and placed her on the bed, saying seriously.
0:21:9|0:21:13|[Nan Fang] looked indulgent and was about to answer when he was interrupted by the sudden appearance of [Meng Meng].
0:21:23|0:21:38|[Nan Fang] anxiously asked for a solution, but received such a response. Seeing [Fei Mei]'s back, she fell into contemplation. [Meng Meng] beside her had already noticed her unusual behavior. She came to the restroom alone, but her mind was on [Na Na].
0:21:38|0:21:42|Recalling [Na Na]'s performance just now, her heart was in turmoil, yet she was powerless.
0:21:44|0:22:7|At that moment, she lost control of her emotions and started crying, feeling sad for [Na Na] who was suffering from illness, and even more for her own helplessness. The expectations and enthusiasm from [Na Na] made her feel extremely guilty. She looked at herself in the mirror, unable to speak through her tears. Soon after, [Fei Mei] called her to go see a doctor together and discuss treatment options.
0:22:17|0:22:24|The doctor's suggestion made her feel embarrassed. For the sake of [Na Na], the man had to cooperate obediently, leaving the doctor puzzled.
0:22:29|0:22:46|The doctor found it strange that there was a distant atmosphere between the two, but seeing how well they were cooperating, he didn't say anything more. [Meng Meng] was anxiously waiting outside with the man's bag, while [Da Peng] was worried but didn't show it. The unknown outcome loomed over the two, their minds already filled with countless thoughts.
0:22:49|0:23:3|[Da Peng] couldn't help but turn around and leave. [Meng Meng] put down her handbag, sat on a chair in the corridor, and listened anxiously to the office. Fortunately, the [doctor] brought good news to everyone, and [Meng Meng] also had hope.
0:23:10|0:23:13|The man and [Fei Mei] listened attentively to the explanation from the [doctor].
0:23:17|0:23:22|[The doctor] hands the treatment advice to [Fei Mei], then continues.
0:24:2|0:24:19|[Doctor] found himself in a dilemma after learning the truth. Having another child could bring hope to [Na Na], but it also meant a choice between two families. Seeing [Fei Mei]'s worried expression, [Doctor] was filled with deep self-blame, unsure of what to do.
0:24:30|0:24:51|Meng Meng learned from Da Peng's explanation about the method to save Na Na, and whether to agree to the surgery was also a dilemma in her heart. After detailed discussions with the doctor, Fei Mei and Nan Fang decided to start implementing the plan. Meng Meng, who learned the truth, looked worried. Fei Mei and the man imagined many outcomes, the first of which was the successful remarriage of the two.
0:24:53|0:25:6|In the scene, a woman in a suit and glasses is looking at an application form. The man and [Fei Mei] have come to her to process their marriage. They exchange awkward glances, but deep down, they are both hopeful that they can successfully obtain their marriage certificate.
0:25:6|0:25:13|Seeing the lady stamping the official seal, the two of them breathed a sigh of relief, which also meant that they were one step closer to saving [Na Na].
0:25:16|0:25:19|But how will they get along with [Meng Meng] and [Da Peng]?
0:25:22|0:25:40|In order to make [Na Na] happy during her recovery, the man and [Fei Mei] brought [Na Na] together, starting a happy life as a family of three. [Fei Mei] shook her head in refusal, but [Na Na] stepped forward to tease him.
0:25:45|0:26:2|You, unable to resist [Na Na]'s coaxing, [Fei Mei] reluctantly got up and walked to the kitchen. Standing at the doorway, she hesitated as she watched [Nan Fang] bustling around, unsure of how to help. The unfamiliar yet familiar kitchen made her feel a bit flustered, causing her to start muttering to herself.
0:26:8|0:26:28|[Nan Fang] skillfully pulled open the drawer and found the pepper. Seeing this, [Fei Mei] didn't know how to respond, the words on the tip of her tongue, but she couldn't say them. With the honey sauce on the ridge, [Na Na] was about to successfully make the sweet and sour fish that [Fei Mei] desired. Watching the man's back, [Fei Mei] felt a mix of emotions in her heart.
0:26:28|0:26:42|The familiar scene, familiar faces, but their relationship can't go back to the way it used to be, even normal communication has become awkward. [Na Na] sits at the table, considerately dividing the chopsticks for them. They look at the rich dishes on the table, each lost in their own thoughts.
0:26:44|0:26:59|[Na Na] also put down her chopsticks in confusion. The two then realized the problem and immediately picked up her favorite sweet and sour fish for [Na Na]. They glanced at each other and quickly moved away, showing signs of discomfort all over, but fortunately [Na Na] did not notice.
0:26:59|0:27:12|At night, [Fei Mei] lay on the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling, when the man slowly walked in. Seeing him, [Fei Mei] nervously clutched the blanket, her eyes involuntarily following his movements, feeling extremely anxious.
0:27:14|0:27:28|[Nan Fang] noticed his unnatural behavior, lifted the covers and sat on the bed. [Fei Mei] was in a panic, but pretended to be calm, [Nan Fang] lifted the covers and lay down. The two of them lay on the bed, engaging in the final mental preparation.
0:27:28|0:27:41|After a moment of calm, the two gradually stabilized their emotions. [Nan Fang] picked up a basin of water and took a big gulp, just to ease the tension in his heart. Fei Mei was also making final preparations. For [Na Na], they must have another child.
0:27:42|0:28:0|However, at this moment, [Meng Meng], who was alone, suddenly sat up from the bed, feeling uneasy and unable to fall asleep. After a moment of contemplation, she immediately dialed the phone, only to find no one answering. Disappointed, she hung up the phone, sat on the bed feeling gloomy, thinking about [Nan Fang] and Fei Mei planning to have another child.
0:28:0|0:28:4|She let out a long sigh, but the restlessness in her heart did not diminish at all.
0:28:5|0:28:20|Looking at the empty room, [Nan Fang] went to the bathroom, turned on the tap, wanting to wash his face to wake up. Unexpectedly, hot water flowed out, steam filled the air, and the reflection in the mirror gradually became blurred. When he looked up, the steam dissipated, and the person in the mirror turned into [Fei Mei].
0:28:20|0:28:30|In the mirror, Nan Fang looks beautiful and graceful, with a gentle look in his eyes. At this moment, Fei Mei is with the man. The smile on Meng Meng's face in the mirror is no longer gentle, but more like mockery.
0:28:31|0:28:44|Mao Meng looked at the mirror with great sadness, but for [Na Na], she had to endure silently. Her face was solemn, unable to come to her senses for a while. A family photo of [Na Na], [Fei Mei], and the male lead was being torn in half.
0:28:44|0:29:1|Meng Meng prepared to take a hot bath, hoping to forget his troubles, but to no avail. He decided to do something to distract himself. The hot water sprinkled down from the top, slid over his cheeks and flowed down his body. He tilted his head back to welcome the baptism of hot water, with his own plans in mind.
0:29:2|0:29:17|The next day, [Meng Meng] went to a hair salon. Her hair was being heated, and she sat in a chair flipping through a magazine. The hairdresser appeared and gave her a delicate hairstyle. With professional service and a beautiful hairstyle, she couldn't bring herself to smile when looking at herself in the mirror.
0:29:17|0:29:34|Looking at herself gradually becoming beautiful under the care of the stylist, she still had a face full of worries. Just finished at the hair salon, [Meng Meng] arrived at the mall again, picked out a beautiful outfit for herself, admired herself carefully in the mirror for a while, and then left swaggering with her spoils.
0:29:34|0:29:46|At this moment, [Da Peng] and [Meng Meng] are in the same boat, both feeling aimless without anyone to enjoy the scenery with. [Da Peng] watches as the car speeds down the road, occasionally glancing in the mirror and adjusting his hair with his hand.
0:29:47|0:30:0|The car drove through the crowded lanes, passing bustling streets before coming to a stop in front of a residential building. Today was the day for [Na Na] to return to the hospital, and [Da Peng] specially drove to [Fei Mei]'s house to take [Na Na] to the hospital.
0:30:0|0:30:7|Although it's unclear how Nan Fang and Fei Mei's relationship is progressing, Da Peng still sticks to his original intention and shows care for Na Na through his actions.
0:30:11|0:30:29|When [Da Peng] entered the neighborhood and arrived downstairs, [Na Na] could see everything clearly from upstairs. As [Da Peng] got out of the car and waved to the upstairs, she immediately understood the signal. This was their tacit understanding, more like a secret code. Every time [Da Peng] came to pick her up, she was very happy, and their relationship developed from there.
0:30:29|0:30:36|At this moment, [Fei Mei] and [Nan Fang] are packing up things for [Na Na] to bring to the hospital. When [Na Na] sees [Da Peng], she says excitedly.
0:30:57|0:31:16|[Nan Fang]'s words made [Fei Mei] pause. The two of them took care of [Na Na] intimately, making [Na Na] extremely happy. While driving, [Da Peng] always kept an eye on [Na Na], and when [Na Na] caught his gaze, she smiled brightly.
0:31:17|0:31:32|Although only exchanging glances, the harmonious atmosphere among the three is enviable, causing the sturdy [Nan Fang] in the co-pilot seat to shift his gaze.
0:31:37|0:31:42|After the car stopped by the roadside, [Nan Fang] got out of the car without looking back, and said to [Na Na] before leaving.
0:31:48|0:32:4|Watching [Na Na] leave in the car, the man reluctantly watched them go. She took out her phone to call [Meng Meng], but received an unexpected message. Following the address given by [Meng Meng], she arrived at the station and searched the hall for a long time, but did not see [Meng Meng]'s figure.
0:32:4|0:32:13|Finally, at the bar, [Meng Meng] was seen in a completely new light. Meeting again, [Meng Meng] was elegantly sipping coffee. The man, upon seeing her, felt nervous, surprised, yet refrained from asking.
0:32:14|0:32:22|Meng Meng's reaction to him was not unexpected. He looked at Nan Fang tenderly without saying a word, but Nan Fang's eyes made him feel chilled.
0:32:22|0:32:33|[Nan Fang] saw [Meng Meng] with a look of disbelief on her face again. He couldn't believe the drastic change in [Meng Meng] in such a short time. He sat down slowly and began to bid farewell to [Meng Meng], but [Meng Meng] had long lost her initial enthusiasm.
0:32:49|0:32:54|[Nan Fang]'s impatience in his words made [Meng Meng] feel disheartened.
0:33:37|0:33:48|[Nan Fang]'s sudden outpouring of deep affection made [Meng Meng] feel ridiculous. By now, she no longer believed in [Nan Fang], she turned to him and asked.
0:34:1|0:34:17|Hearing [Nan Fang]'s helpless answer only made him even more disappointed. He pushed [Nan Fang] away and walked off with tears in his eyes. [Nan Fang] followed behind, chasing after him all the way to the train. He followed the train attendant into the carriage and searched room by room for [Meng Meng]'s figure.
0:34:17|0:34:37|The carriage was crowded with people, and the blankets on the foggy cloth were piled up messily. He searched carefully, afraid of missing Meng Meng. He scanned from top to bottom, not even missing under the bed. He walked through one carriage after another, opening one door after another. He searched anxiously, just to be able to see his beloved one here.
0:34:37|0:34:48|The backpack slipped off his shoulder, and he casually picked it up and threw it behind him. At this moment, he was only focused on finding Meng Meng as quickly as possible. Passing through a dimly lit train car, he spotted a familiar figure.
0:34:48|0:35:4|He stopped in his tracks, carefully identifying [Meng Meng]. Once confirmed, he immediately turned around and arrived at the door of the carriage, eager to open it. However, [Meng Meng] had locked the door from the inside. He shook the door handle forcefully, but still couldn't open it.
0:35:4|0:35:9|He watched as [Meng Meng] inside continued knocking on the door, but [Meng Meng] still ignored him.
0:35:40|0:35:48|The arrival of the police made the two calm down. Seeing the scene of the two, the police didn't know what else to say, so they left.
0:35:52|0:36:0|Back to the afternoon when the four of them went to see the doctor, [Da Peng] and Meng Meng were waiting in the corridor, but unexpectedly the doctor asked them to go in together.
0:36:2|0:36:12|Upon hearing this, the two of them exchanged a glance and then walked into the office. The situation of the four individuals was very unique, requiring careful consideration of a plan of action. The doctor's response brought them hope.
0:37:0|0:37:15|Upon hearing the doctor's proposed solution, [Fei Mei] saw a glimmer of hope. Artificial insemination was undoubtedly the best option at the moment, as it could preserve their relationship while also saving [Na Na]. Upon hearing the plan, [Meng Meng] had a satisfied smile on her face.
0:37:15|0:37:20|In the evening, the four of them arrived at [Fei Mei]'s house, and the man personally cooked sweet and sour fish that [Na Na] loves to eat.
0:37:26|0:37:48|Fei Mei decisively rejected Na Na's proposal. However, she couldn't resist Na Na's sweet talk and eventually agreed. Meanwhile, Meng Meng was making salad in the living room when Da Peng entered with a box of beer. Their simple conversation witnessed the gradual harmonization of their relationship.
0:37:48|0:37:50|[Da Peng] put down the beer and said to [Meng Meng].
0:37:55|0:38:11|Meng Meng nodded and continued making salad. Seeing Da Peng turning into the house, Meng Meng's eyes were full of meaning. The man carefully prepared dishes in the kitchen, although he was in his ex-wife's house, the positions of things were still familiar.
0:38:11|0:38:16|A bowl of secret sauce poured into the pot, [Na Na]'s meticulously prepared sweet and sour fish is entering the final stage.
0:38:18|0:38:30|[Nan Fang] is working methodically in the kitchen, with [Meng Meng] by her side preparing side dishes, creating a harmonious atmosphere that stings [Fei Mei] deeply. She had hoped to follow [Na Na]'s advice for help, only to find that there was no place for her at all.
0:39:0|0:39:13|At the dining table, [Na Na] sensibly hands out chopsticks to everyone, with [Da Peng] and [Meng Meng] sitting on her left and right respectively. The man and [Fei Mei] sit on the other sides, and an inadvertent eye contact between them makes the two slightly embarrassed.
0:39:13|0:39:22|The familiar atmosphere made [Na Na] hesitant to pick up her chopsticks, the four of them sitting around the table with hidden thoughts, thanks to the quick wit of [Da Peng] who broke the awkward situation.
0:39:34|0:39:49|The man eagerly awaited [Na Na]'s evaluation.
0:39:59|0:40:2|Upon hearing [Na Na]'s words, everyone exchanged smiles.
0:40:6|0:40:18|The lively and lovely [Na Na] made the meal go particularly smoothly. [Da Peng] poured beer for [Nan Fang], while [Na Na] couldn't take her eyes off. After the meal, [Da Peng] drove [Nan Fang] and the two of them to the hotel downstairs.
0:40:40|0:40:47|After driving, Nan Fang and Fei Mei checked in. Nan Fang wanted to hold Meng Meng's hand, but she unexpectedly shook it off.
0:40:51|0:41:3|[Meng Meng] walked ahead with her hands in her pockets, completely ignoring the man behind her as she searched for the room. At the end of the hallway, she found their room, and the man promptly opened the door.
0:41:8|0:41:19|The man looked surprised, put down his luggage, and quickly stepped forward to comfort her. However, [Meng Meng] looked displeased and directly rejected his hug.
0:41:21|0:41:24|[Meng Meng] suddenly challenged, and she had to patiently explain. Meng Meng's nausea left her speechless, she didn't want to tell [Meng Meng] to avoid affecting their relationship, but in the end, she was still misunderstood.
0:41:57|0:42:17|The man stood up and opened the door, a woman carrying a kettle walked in, placed the kettle down, and asked the man a question. This was undoubtedly a guest order. Seeing that Meng Meng didn't speak, the man returned to his room.
0:42:19|0:42:28|[Nan Fang] inexplicably opened the door, only to find no one outside, but a water kettle on the ground. Just as he was about to step out to investigate, [Meng Meng] appeared.
0:42:33|0:42:44|[Fei Mei] and [Da Peng] sent [Na Na] back to the hospital, then drove home together. Along the way, [Fei Mei] was silent and preoccupied, while [Da Peng] was in a low mood, with a gloomy expression on his face.
0:42:44|0:42:51|The doctor's advice, while it could save Na Na's life, also means that Fei Mei and Nan Fang's bond will have another tie if they have another child.
0:42:52|0:43:9|This is also unfair to [Da Peng]. [Fei Mei] is lost in thought because of this, and [Da Peng] is also frowning. At this moment, they do not know each other's intentions, and neither wants to speak first to discuss a solution. Back at home, [Fei Mei] hugs [Da Peng] tightly, hoping to convey her feelings through this gesture.
0:43:9|0:43:12|[Da Peng]'s performance made [Fei Mei] see the key to the problem.
0:43:36|0:44:1|[Da Peng]'s answer confirmed [Fei Mei]'s guess. [Fei Mei] caressed [Da Peng]'s cheek and gazed deeply into his eyes. Hearing [Da Peng]'s response, [Fei Mei] looked guilty.
0:44:22|0:44:31|[Da Peng] paused, as [Fei Mei] slowly approached, gently stroking [Da Peng]'s back and leaning against him. Looking at the tender [Fei Mei], [Da Peng] softened.
0:44:35|0:44:47|At this moment, [Meng Meng] is standing on the balcony enjoying the breeze, when [Nan Fang] comes up behind her and gently embraces her, resolving the misunderstanding and reconciling the two of them.
0:45:0|0:45:4|The two exchanged a smile, and Meng Meng's words took her by surprise.
0:45:10|0:45:21|[Nan Fang] immediately expressed his thoughts. This statement shattered [Meng Meng]'s hopes, but it also confirmed another matter.
0:45:32|0:45:43|According to the law, when Meng Meng's explanation was heard, Nan Fang remained silent. He leaned on the railing with both hands, staring blankly into the distance.
0:45:50|0:45:54|Although Nan Fang said so on the surface, he had other thoughts in his heart.
0:46:1|0:46:9|Looking at [Meng Meng]'s eager eyes, the man stroked her hair, which further strengthened his own inner thoughts.
0:46:15|0:46:31|In the scene, Nan Fang, Fei Mei, Meng Meng, and Da Peng arrived at the Civil Affairs Bureau. They were all dressed up and in high spirits. Although the bureau was not open yet, it didn't dampen their happy mood. A woman in a suit and glasses approached them, and they immediately straightened their clothes and followed her into the room.
0:46:31|0:46:47|The woman carefully read the materials she received, then looked at the four people with a serious expression. Despite her doubts, she stamped the documents for the two new couples who were sweetly in love. The man looked happy, while [Meng Meng] sat beside him blushing shyly.
0:46:47|0:47:3|Fei Mei and Da Peng exchanged smiles, having long ago accepted each other in their hearts. As the seal was stamped, their marital relationship also became official. Nan Fang's and Fei Mei's states were also very different, no longer filled with worry but instead with radiant smiles.
0:47:3|0:47:8|In the afternoon, [Meng Meng] and [Nan Fang] returned to the hotel. [Meng Meng] lay on him, looking at him tenderly.
0:47:15|0:47:29|[Meng Meng] gently touched her cheek and gazed deeply into her eyes. Faced with Meng Meng's praise, she shook her head in confusion, and Meng Meng took out a mirror for her to see herself.
0:47:45|0:48:5|That day, Nan Fang came to the hospital to prepare for artificial insemination. Under the guidance of [Doctor], he arrived at the door of the next room. He took out an empty bottle and walked into the room, made sure no one was there, and closed the door. He turned on the TV, took out the original tape and put it into the VCR, and everything was ready.
0:48:5|0:48:12|He sat on the sofa with a vacant look in his eyes, waiting for the video to play. This is currently the best way to save [Na Na], he must complete the mission.
0:48:15|0:48:34|Artificial insemination refers to the collection of semen from the male, which is then processed and injected into the female reproductive organs by a doctor to achieve the purpose of conception. The most important thing is to combine the sperm and egg to form a fertilized egg. It is necessary to use a fine needle under a microscope to directly inject a sperm into the egg cell.
0:48:37|0:48:53|When the sperm and egg merge to form an embryo, undergo repeated cell divisions, and eventually give birth to a new life, the embryo is then transferred to the mother's uterus. Once successfully implanted, artificial insemination surgery can be successful. [Fei Mei] also changed into surgical scrubs and entered the operating room.
0:48:55|0:49:17|The nurses are adjusting the instruments for them, and she lies nervously on the operating bed. [Da Peng] at the door looks at her with comfort. As the operating room door closes, [Fei Mei]'s surgery officially begins. [Da Peng] silently cheers for her in his heart, although reluctant, he has to leave.
0:49:17|0:49:24|On the surgical cart dragged by the nurse, various surgical knives were placed, sending chills down the spine. But for [Na Na], [Fei Mei] had to bear it alone.
0:49:28|0:49:46|In the cockpit of a running airplane, after pilot [Da Peng] completed all the operations, he unfastened his seatbelt and said to the person next to him. [Da Peng] walked to the aisle for a short break. As the flight attendant opened the curtain, [Da Peng], who was drinking water, saw [Nan Fang] and [Meng Meng] on the plane.
0:49:46|0:49:55|There were too many flight attendants, so he didn't want to initiate a greeting. [Meng Meng] ordered a glass of orange juice and turned to ask [Nan Fang].
0:50:2|0:50:11|These two recognized themselves, [Da Peng] raised his hand and warmly greeted them. The two raised their glasses in response, this time they were ready to go back and get married.
0:50:39|0:50:59|The next day, the two returned to the hotel with their luggage once again. This time, there was no joy of marriage or the sadness of a big fight, but rather due to Na Na's deteriorating condition. They still checked into the room at the end of the corridor, but their mood this time was completely different from the last time.
0:50:59|0:51:3|The man politely thanked the staff, while [Meng Meng] remained silent all the way.
0:51:7|0:51:16|Nana, whose condition worsened, lay on the hospital bed with an IV drip, sleeping. A piercing pain gradually woke her up, and she cried out for her father.
0:51:51|0:52:1|[Nan Fang] felt a little sad after hearing [Na Na]'s words. Instead of replying, [Na Na] looked towards [Meng Meng] on the side.
0:52:12|0:52:31|[Na Na] may say so, but deep down she is still sad, with no smile on her face. [Da Peng] helps [Fei Mei] with her big belly out of the elevator. Seeing [Nan Fang] and [Meng Meng] looking a bit stunned, the two of them make eye contact and then walk towards them. Upon seeing this, [Nan Fang] and [Meng Meng] also stand up in surprise.
0:52:34|0:52:50|[Da Peng] and [Nan Fang] shook hands, while [Fei Mei] and [Meng Meng] nodded with a smile. Today, [Fei Mei] came to donate cord blood. She changed into surgical gown and lay on the operating table, looking at the doctor examining her with a vacant expression, sighing as she gazed at the ceiling.
0:52:50|0:53:0|The ice-cold touch made her feel a little at a loss, then a slender needle pierced into her belly, causing a sharp pain that she had to grit her teeth and endure.
0:53:4|0:53:21|A small tube of extracted blood became the life-saving medicine for [Na Na]. The doctor in the room is conducting tests, while the man outside is extremely anxious, and [Da Peng] beside him remains silent. Both of them are very concerned about the final outcome, but now they can't do anything but wait patiently.
0:53:23|0:53:36|In front of the train platform, [Nan Fang] walked while staring at the people in the carriage. His brows furrowed, feeling anxious, and coincidentally met the train attendant outside the carriage. He quickly stepped forward and made his request.
0:53:38|0:53:51|The train started moving, and [Nan Fang] began searching through each compartment. He followed the train attendant to the compartments, opened the connecting doors one by one, until he found a familiar figure in a small room.
0:53:54|0:54:9|He quickly turned around, trying to confirm his identity. Unexpectedly, the compartment door was locked from the inside by [Meng Meng]. He held the door handle and shook it repeatedly, trying to open it, but the compartment door remained motionless.
0:54:9|0:54:22|Seeing no response after knocking on the door, the two gradually calmed down. The man looked inside with a worried expression on his face, staring at [Meng Meng]. [Meng Meng] slowly raised her head and gazed deeply into the man's eyes. Her pitiful expression was full of grievances, making the man unable to bear it in his heart.
0:54:25|0:54:42|[Nan Fang] turned her head slightly, not letting [Meng Meng] see her sad expression. Cheng Jing suddenly passed by, and [Nan Fang] quickly pushed aside to make way for him. Seeing the scene of the two of them, Cheng Jing had already made a conclusion in his heart, so he didn't say anything and just left.
0:54:42|0:54:51|[Nan Fang] at this time had dull eyes and a serious expression, constantly changing thoughts. When he saw that it was [Meng Meng] calling, his eyes immediately softened.
0:55:11|0:55:28|The man was filled with mixed emotions after listening, unsure of how to retain. Upon hearing the response from [Nan Fang], [Meng Meng] remained expressionless, not speaking for a long time. She put down her phone, tears of sadness swirling in her eyes. After finishing the call, [Nan Fang] had a serious expression on his face.
0:55:28|0:55:31|She hoped [Meng Meng] would stay, but she didn't know how to ask. Meanwhile, [Na Na] was in the hospital muttering about finding her dad.
0:56:12|0:56:15|[Da Peng] sees the situation and quickly comforts him.
0:56:19|0:56:41|[Na Na] still looked gloomy after listening, [Da Peng] helped her dial the man's phone number. [Na Na]'s reaction was heart-wrenching. With a voice filled with tears, [Na Na] made everyone's heart ache, and [Fei Mei] and [Da Peng] beside her were also very sad.
0:56:41|0:56:45|[Da Peng] holds [Fei Mei]'s hand to comfort her, always keeping an eye on [Fei Mei]'s condition.
0:56:47|0:56:58|Unfortunately, [Na Na] did not wait for her father and passed away. In the photo, [Na Na]'s bright eyes are particularly beautiful, and the man gently placed her ashes box on the cabinet at home.
0:57:4|0:57:11|[Fei Mei] stood in the living room with a big belly, looking dejected. [Meng Meng] gazed thoughtfully at the urn containing [Na Na]'s ashes.
0:57:28|0:57:31|[Meng Meng] stood aside, crying uncontrollably, constantly wiping away tears.
0:57:33|0:57:39|[Fei Mei] looked at the photo of [Na Na] with tears streaming down her face, constantly touching her chest, trying to keep herself calm.
0:57:49|0:57:54|Seeing [Fei Mei] in such deep sorrow, [Da Peng] stepped forward to comfort her and reminded her to take care of herself.
0:58:7|0:58:18|[Fei Mei] is extremely sorrowful, feeling a strong aversion towards the child in her belly. [Da Peng] and [Nan Fang] support [Fei Mei] and help her back to her room to rest, while [Meng Meng] also looks on with deep sorrow.
0:58:25|0:58:44|[Fei Mei] was struggling in pain on the operating table, while the other three waited anxiously outside the room. When they saw the doctor, the man hurriedly approached to inquire. [Da Peng] looked at the man, patted his shoulder, indicating for him to go in. As the man entered, [Da Peng] followed closely behind.
0:58:44|0:58:49|When he reached the door, [Da Peng] looked at [Meng Meng] sitting on the chair. [Meng Meng] smiled in response but did not get up.
0:58:51|0:59:5|The child in the nurse's arms was not crying or making noise, with [Da Peng] and [Nan Fang] looking at the child with smiles on their faces. The nurse carried the child to [Fei Mei]'s bedside, and [Nan Fang] looked at the child and said to her.
0:59:9|0:59:12|[Fei Mei] replied with a smile after listening.
0:59:15|0:59:40|Baby, this heartwarming scene of a family of three was seen by [Da Peng], while [Meng Meng] on the corridor is nowhere to be found at the moment. At night, [Meng Meng] tossed and turned in bed. Outside the window, thunder and rain were raging, but all [Meng Meng] could think of was [Na Na].
0:59:40|0:59:44|[Na Na]'s voice echoed in her ears, tears streaming down her face as she tightly hugged the blanket.
0:59:46|1:0:1|[Nana], who was sleeping in the hospital, was awakened by the thunder outside the window. She slowly sat up and noticed something unusual about the child in the opposite bed. She lifted the blanket and approached the child's bed to investigate. She found him tossing and turning in bed, his figure writhing in pain.
1:0:13|1:0:21|Her painful appearance was all seen by [Na Na]. It was the first time [Na Na] had seen such a scene, and she was terrified. [Na Na] turned and ran out of the ward, looking for her parents.
1:0:34|1:0:51|[Doctor] learned about the situation and hurried to the ward to save the patient. The child in the ward was also awakened and sat up with squinted eyes. [Doctor] picked up the suffering child and placed him on the emergency bed, inserted an oxygen cylinder for him, and immediately sent him for rescue. [Na Na] covered her eyes in fear, witnessing the whole process.
1:0:51|1:1:3|After everyone left, she looked out the window in horror. The other children in the ward were also scared and crying loudly, except for [Na Na], who quietly walked back to her bed, holding onto the edge of the bed and staring blankly at the door.
1:1:4|1:1:24|At night, in a dimly lit bar, [Meng Meng] and [Da Peng] are sitting at the bar drinking. The two of them have vacant expressions and look serious. [Meng Meng] lets out a long sigh, picks up her glass and starts to taste the drink. Meanwhile, a weeping couple approaches a man walking in the hospital corridor.
1:1:24|1:1:31|The man hastened his pace upon seeing this scene and arrived at the ward. Inside the ward, after the nurse finished tidying up the bed of the deceased child, she then went to the bedside of [Na Na].
1:1:34|1:1:37|He was in a state of extreme panic, when [Na Na] behind him noticed him.
1:1:42|1:1:46|He quickly turned around and embraced [Na Na], but she choked up and pointed at the sickbed.
1:2:12|1:2:27|He hugged [Na Na] in tears, feeling extremely sad. In the bar, [Meng Meng] sat blankly with empty eyes, while [Da Peng] casually invited him to drink. [Meng Meng] smiled and clinked glasses with [Da Peng], and they each took a sip.
1:2:35|1:2:37|He turned his head to look at [Da Peng].
1:2:47|1:2:53|Meng Meng was stunned, looking at Da Peng with a puzzled expression. Da Peng then provided an explanation.
1:3:4|1:3:8|[Da Peng] looked at [Meng Meng] and expressed his thoughts. After hearing it, [Meng Meng] lowered her head and fell into deep thought.
1:3:25|1:3:40|The third plan starts with a conversation between [Fei Mei] and [Meng Meng]. On this day, [Meng Meng] arrived early at the restaurant to wait for [Fei Mei]. The environment here is quiet and beautiful, with an ancient and elegant atmosphere. The clean and bright floor-to-ceiling windows provide a clear view of the scenery outside.
1:3:42|1:3:57|[Fei Mei] arrived on time as invited by [Meng Meng]. After looking around the front desk with the help of a staff member, she successfully found [Meng Meng] and walked towards her. Upon seeing [Fei Mei] arrive, [Meng Meng] quickly stood up to greet her.
1:4:29|1:4:46|On their side, an elegant woman is playing the guzheng on stage. [Meng Meng] looks at [Fei Mei] with a smile on her face, nervously clasping her hands in front of her chest. Tea washing, brewing, pouring into the pot, pouring into the cup, pouring into the pot, serving tea, all done skillfully by the female waiter.
1:4:46|1:4:51|Soon, the tea was ready, and she placed it on a tray, handing it to [Meng Meng] with both hands.
1:4:56|1:4:59|Then, the tea was handed to [Fei Mei].
1:5:3|1:5:15|[Meng Meng] took the tea and first smelled the tea fragrance. After a glance at [Meng Meng], [Fei Mei] directly picked up the tea cup and started drinking. Putting down the tea cup, [Meng Meng] looked at [Fei Mei] and hesitated for a moment before speaking.
1:5:39|1:5:42|[Fei Mei] looked up, a hint of surprise in her eyes.
1:6:3|1:6:9|Fei Mei lowered her head in thought, raised the teacup and took a sip, then Meng Meng continued speaking.
1:6:13|1:6:15|Fei Mei's hand, which was pouring tea, suddenly stopped.
1:6:24|1:6:30|[Fei Mei] picked up the teapot and filled her cup for her. After thanking her politely, she said.
1:6:37|1:6:43|[Fei Mei] looked up at her. [Na Na] smiled and said.
1:6:54|1:6:56|She looked at Fei Mei with anticipation on her face.
1:7:2|1:7:5|Fei Mei suddenly looked up and gazed at him seriously.
1:7:10|1:7:13|Nan Fang candidly revealed his plan.
1:7:54|1:7:57|Fei Mei looked away guiltily.
1:8:2|1:8:5|Fei Mei took a deep breath and said.
1:8:27|1:8:45|Fei Mei's emotions suddenly got out of control, and the two of them looked around anxiously. The woman on the stage glanced at them and then resumed playing the piano. Meng Meng let out a long sigh and said, "Meng Meng's mood gradually became despondent."
1:8:52|1:8:59|Wang Meng spoke, her eyes gradually moistening, she lowered her head and thought for a moment before saying.
1:9:17|1:9:22|Fei Mei couldn't bear to see the tearful and pitiful look of [Meng Meng].
1:9:33|1:9:40|She looked at [Meng Meng] with a determined look, and after a moment, she stood up and said to [Meng Meng].
1:9:51|1:9:55|Wang Meng finished speaking and then turned his head to look elsewhere.
1:10:1|1:10:11|[Wang Meng] looked up at her. After a moment of eye contact, [Fei Mei] took out a banknote from her bag and placed it on the table.
1:10:16|1:10:35|[Fei Mei] finished speaking and then left with her bag. As [Fei Mei] gradually moved away, [Meng Meng] sat slumped in the chair as if she had lost her soul. She let out a long sigh, and tears unknowingly welled up in her eyes. She hugged her arms and quietly wiped away the tears of sadness in her eyes.
1:10:35|1:10:45|That day, Nan Fang arrived at Fei Mei's house with his luggage. This visit was to seek reconciliation with Fei Mei and save Na Na. He unlocked the door with a key and walked in with his luggage.
1:10:49|1:11:3|She took out her toiletries and neatly placed them on the sink in the bathroom. After carefully examining herself in the mirror for a moment, she sighed deeply. She opened the wardrobe, found the bed sheets and blankets, and went to [Na Na]'s room.
1:11:6|1:11:21|The room was decorated very warmly, with a sofa, TV, and everything else. The pink bedsheets and quilt exuded a strong girlish vibe. There was also a cute Mickey Mouse doll on the bed. [Nan Fang] picked up the doll and looked at it for a moment before placing it on a chair nearby.
1:11:27|1:11:51|[Da Peng] began to carefully tidy up the bed, and after arranging it properly, he sat on the bed, stroking the blanket, lost in thought. Then he went to the kitchen to prepare dinner for [Fei Mei]. At this moment, [Fei Mei], who had just finished work and was carrying a briefcase, entered through the door, completely unaware of the man in the kitchen.
1:11:51|1:11:53|Upon hearing the voice of the man, [Fei Mei] looked surprised.
1:11:57|1:12:20|[He] hung up his briefcase, took off his coat, and after tidying up, turned to the dining table. At this moment, the man brought the last dish to the table. Seeing this, [Fei Mei] went to wash her hands. The man set the tableware, took off his apron, and said to [Fei Mei] behind him. The two looked at each other without saying a word.
1:12:20|1:12:24|Fei Mei sits down at the table, and the man takes out a piece of paper from his chest pocket and hands it to Fei Mei.
1:15:35|1:15:49|The two had a disagreement in their beliefs and ended up arguing and parting ways. [Fei Mei] sat sullenly on the bed in the bedroom, then glanced at [Nan Fang] and slammed the door shut fiercely after a moment of calmness. The loud noise left [Nan Fang] feeling a bit bewildered.
1:15:49|1:15:56|In the bar, Meng Meng was drinking alone with a troubled expression on her face. She finished her drink in one gulp and emotionlessly said to Da Peng.
1:15:59|1:16:20|[Da Peng] picked up the wine glass, took a sip, and remained silent. Meng Meng grabbed the wine bottle and filled his own glass, looking at [Da Peng] beside him. He looked at [Da Peng] with a disappointed expression. Upon hearing [Da Peng]'s response, he suddenly smiled and said self-deprecatingly.
1:16:23|1:16:39|[Meng Meng] picked up a full glass of wine and drank it all in one go. Looking at the disheveled [Meng Meng], [Da Peng] felt a bit worried. Choked by the strong liquor, [Meng Meng] kept coughing but still refilled her own glass.
1:16:39|1:16:47|On stage, a young man holding a highball glass is singing, while [Meng Meng] looks at him with a lost expression.
1:16:52|1:17:10|He drank alone, with a hint of loneliness in his eyes. Then, he spoke rationally. Turning to [Da Peng], he said. With a sense of reluctance in his heart, he drank heavily.
1:17:12|1:17:36|[Da Peng] didn't know how to comfort in this situation. With a drink in her, [Meng Meng] lay on the bar, looking at [Da Peng]. [Meng Meng] became emotional and started muttering to herself. She angrily tried to pour herself a drink, only to find the bottle empty.
1:17:39|1:17:55|He looked at the empty wine bottle, in a moment of desperation he threw it out, the flying bottle smashed the mirror and also cut [Da Peng]'s forehead. The people in the bar heard the commotion and quieted down, the young man singing on stage was scared stiff.
1:17:55|1:18:4|Meng Meng looked at Da Peng's bleeding forehead and instantly sobered up. The waiter came over to check the situation, looking at the mirror and then at the two of them, somewhat incredulous.
1:18:8|1:18:18|In the hospital room, [Na Na] sits alone on the bed, with cute dolls and her hat placed behind her. She spreads out a notebook on her lap and writes earnestly, the title being "My Will".
1:19:2|1:19:13|[Na Na] fell asleep holding the pencil after finishing writing, while the man sat at the bedside looking at the notebook, feeling a mix of emotions. He gently rested his head on [Na Na]'s shoulder, savoring her presence.
1:19:16|1:19:33|In the car, [Da Peng] with bandage on his forehead is driving. Sitting in the back seat, [Meng Meng] is staring ahead expressionlessly. [Da Peng], busy observing the road, pays no attention to [Meng Meng] looking at him. Passing through an overpass, a car speeds past them.
1:19:46|1:20:1|Unexpectedly, [Da Peng]'s next words caught him off guard. At this moment, [Nan Fang] arrived at the Children's Library in Beijing. After hesitating at the entrance for a moment, he walked in.
1:20:31|1:20:40|[Nan Fang] arrived at the entrance of a library, where many children were reading books. He walked in and asked the staff inside.
1:20:58|1:21:12|[Nan Fang] walked out the door and headed towards the archive room. The buildings outside exuded a classical atmosphere, lush trees swayed in the wind, and the pond shimmered with waves of light under the sunlight.
1:21:12|1:21:21|[Nan Fang] just walked in and saw [Fei Mei] coming down from upstairs with materials in her arms. [Fei Mei] looked a bit surprised to see him, and after a moment of eye contact, the two of them went outside.
1:21:25|1:21:41|The old window, straight pillars, and elegant ancient architecture. Two people walk in a line on the corridor, the man looks back at [Fei Mei]. They stop and make eye contact, but [Fei Mei] lowers her head and avoids eye contact. Neither of them speaks, and they continue to arrive at a square.
1:21:45|1:22:7|[Nan Fang] walked with his hands in his pockets and a briefcase in front of him. [Fei Mei] looked at [Nan Fang]'s back thoughtfully. After a moment of contemplation, she quickened her pace and walked up to [Nan Fang]. Seeing the familiar scene, [Nan Fang] couldn't help but express his feelings and said to [Fei Mei] beside him.
1:22:32|1:22:34|[Fei Mei] nodded after listening.
1:22:38|1:22:44|[Nan Fang]'s words caught [Fei Mei] off guard, she stopped in her tracks and looked [Nan Fang] up and down.
1:22:50|1:23:0|[Fei Mei] felt a little sad after listening, she slowly raised her head and met eyes with [Nan Fang], then she forced herself to stay calm and said to [Nan Fang] with a smile.
1:23:8|1:23:28|[Nan Fang] listened and nodded in agreement. At that moment, a car was slowly approaching them, catching the attention of both. [Nan Fang] turned his head slowly and saw [Meng Meng] getting out of the car with a bag in hand. She closed the car door, adjusted her hair, and walked towards the two with a smile on her face, watching [Nan Fang] and [Fei Mei] chatting happily.
1:23:28|1:23:45|Her expression was somewhat awkward, [Nan Fang] quickly approached and embraced her tightly on the bridge, expressing their longing for each other through actions. The man sighed as he held [Meng Meng], feeling relieved. The car slowly started and arrived in front of [Fei Mei].
1:23:45|1:24:2|[Fei Mei] walked down the steps and saw two people hugging, smiling contentedly. Then she was attracted by a sedan, looking inside with a puzzled expression. [Da Peng] opened the car door and walked out with a bandage on his forehead. He leaned against the car roof with one hand and held the car door with the other, looking at [Fei Mei] with a silly smile.
1:24:2|1:24:21|Fei Mei saw the warm and cheerful [Da Peng], and also showed a sweet smile. The two happily gazed at each other. After a moment, Fei Mei nodded approvingly at [Da Peng]. Countless words melted into the gaze of this moment. Fei Mei looked at [Da Peng]'s expression, knowing exactly what was in his heart.
1:24:23|1:24:35|The elevator doors opened, and a woman pushing a baby stroller entered the elevator, accompanied by the lively and cute [Na Na]. Once inside the elevator, [Na Na] looked up at the woman with an innocent expression.
