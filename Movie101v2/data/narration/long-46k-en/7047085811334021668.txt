0:0:53|0:1:6|Jumping onto a rooftop, a sudden lightning strike in the sky turned [the Clown] into a real person. Holding a broken makeup mirror in his hand, he grotesquely touched up his face, then suddenly turned his head, his eyes terrifying.
0:1:8|0:1:14|The [clown] in this film is the male lead, young man [Zheng Kaisi] from the small town.
0:1:23|0:1:41|A metallic pentagram floats in the air, with its surface texture infinitely magnified, resembling the ravines in the mountains. The gleam on the metal surface shimmers under the light, as if possessing a magical power, attracting everyone to fight for it, stirring up a bloody storm.
0:1:55|0:2:3|In a dimly lit hall, a man is being dragged away on the ground. A group of monsters are fighting each other with long knives, creating a bloody and eerie scene.
0:2:29|0:2:49|In the hall, two people are arguing about something, but the shadows of the two on the wall have turned into two monsters fighting, one of which is killed by a knife. Outside the chaotic hall, a giant cruise ship is slowly sailing on the sea, with lights shining towards a stormy night and the endless sea.
0:2:49|0:2:57|Above the ship, several seagulls flew by, and following their gaze, a helicopter landed above the deck.
0:3:21|0:3:41|With that, the clown in the animation appeared again, his laughter eerie and sinister, holding a sharp knife as he approached a man from behind. The man had the number 017 imprinted on his neck. Without any hesitation, the clown plunged the knife down, blood splattering everywhere, a triumphant and maniacal smile blooming on his face.
0:3:41|0:3:59|Frozen on the TV screen. In the arcade, [Zheng Kaisi] dressed as a [clown], staring blankly at the clown doll in the glass cabinet. A colleague nearby rushed over in frustration, giving him a hard pat on the shoulder and said. [Zheng Kaisi] jumped in surprise.
0:4:9|0:4:22|[Zheng Kaisi] gave his colleague a cold look, stood up reluctantly, and his colleague was so angry that he wanted to hit him. [Zheng Kaisi] took a photo with the customer expressionlessly, then handed the phone to his colleague and walked away arrogantly.
0:4:23|0:4:38|[Zheng Kaisi] sat in front of the game machine, just inserted the game coin, when suddenly a few popcorns hit his head. He turned his head and saw the man sitting not far away, laughing at him, was his childhood friend, Li Jun.
0:4:40|0:4:55|[Li Jun]. [Li Jun]'s smile suddenly froze, blood vessels appeared on his face instantly, his body uncontrollably swayed, and his chin suddenly inflated like a balloon, turning into a long-eared big-headed monster in [Zheng Kaisi]'s horrified gaze.
0:4:55|0:5:0|At the same time, the same thing is happening on the moving subway in the city.
0:5:0|0:5:22|Passengers mutated like [Li Jun], with long-eared big-headed monsters, long-necked flat-headed monsters, and octagonal-headed monsters filling the entire carriage. [Zheng Kaisi] had two knives inserted behind him, suddenly appearing on the rooftop of a building. With one foot on the edge of the rooftop, he ran forward with the help of the force, shuttling freely between the buildings at rocket-like speed.
0:5:22|0:5:44|Under the towering skyscraper, amidst the fast-flowing traffic, [Zheng Kaisi] leaped into the air with inertia, striking a pose before gracefully landing in the subway car. Without even getting up, he swiftly dealt with two passengers about to mutate. The entire car of monsters stared at [Zheng Kaisi] hungrily, but he remained calm and easily dodged their attacks.
0:5:44|0:5:55|Dodging one of their attacks, he turned to look at them, his expression full of provocation. With two knives in hand, he took down one with each knife, instantly knocking down a large group. A head of an octagonal monster flew over.
0:5:55|0:6:5|[Zheng Kaisi] dodged backwards, killing him with one stroke, then did a side somersault, landing smoothly without any slack, and continued to fight forward.
0:6:5|0:6:27|He kicked open the door of another train car, and suddenly heard the monster's gasping behind him. He turned around abruptly, kicked it out of the window, and then engaged in a fight with the next monster in the next car. [Zheng Kaisi] had lost his mind in the frenzy of killing, eagerly killing every monster that came rushing towards him, fighting his way through car after car.
0:6:27|0:6:45|In an instant, blood splattered everywhere, and as far as the eye could see, there were only severed limbs and body parts. The subway was speeding along, but it couldn't match the speed of [Zheng Kaisi]'s slaughter. The scene inside the carriage looked terrifying and gruesome. However, in the next moment, everything disappeared abruptly at the clap of [Li Jun]'s hands.
0:8:42|0:9:0|[Li Jun] was suddenly speechless, his expression becoming unnatural, and [Zheng Kaisi] ignored him. He walked to the side, wiping the makeup off his face in front of the mirror. At the same time, the mall's broadcast started, signaling that the business hours were coming to an end.
0:9:0|0:9:10|The next day, [Zheng Kaisi] sat by his mother's bedside, playing a mobile game. The sunlight shone through the window onto his mother's peaceful face, everything was calm as usual.
0:9:11|0:9:27|Nurse Liu Qing walked in with medication, ready to change the IV for another patient. When [Zheng Kaisi] saw her, he immediately put away his phone and kept his gaze on her, not looking away. Liu Qing felt [Zheng Kaisi] staring at her, glanced at him, and decided not to pay any attention to him.
0:9:27|0:9:38|[Zheng Kaisi] took out a candy from the small iron box and threw it into his mouth. Then he stood up, casually broke the flowers in front of someone else's bed, and walked out. After Liu Qing finished hanging the IV drip, she turned her head and followed him out.
0:9:42|0:9:48|[Zheng Kaisi] had a flower in his mouth, blocking Liu Qing's way, but Liu Qing remained expressionless.
0:9:49|0:9:56|Liu Qing agilely dodged around [Zheng Kaisi] and walked straight ahead. [Zheng Kaisi] hurriedly caught up and took out the flower from his mouth to hand it to Liu Qing.
0:10:28|0:10:40|Liu Qing became increasingly impatient and turned to the disinfection room. [Zheng Kaisi] followed persistently, leaning against the door and watching her.
0:11:0|0:11:6|The patient deliberately lifted his buttocks, and the people around laughed.
0:11:23|0:11:42|Liu Qing stared at him. [Zheng Kaisi] was stunned, speechless. Seeing [Zheng Kaisi] silent, Liu Qing gave him a disdainful look and walked into the ward.
0:11:45|0:11:53|[Zheng Kaisi]'s anger could no longer be contained, the clown inside him seemed to have emerged, grabbing a bottle of saline water and charging in.
0:12:3|0:12:16|A nearby patient was scared and fainted. Liu Qing hurried forward to rescue, causing chaos in the ward. After the nurse bandaged the wound on [Zheng Kaisi]'s hand, she turned around and ignored him.
0:12:17|0:12:34|[Zheng Kaisi] stood up and walked towards the corridor, the bandage on his hand making him very uncomfortable, unable to help but fidget. He suddenly stopped, looked closely, and found that his mother's bed had been moved to the corridor. He hurried to the door of the ward, only to find that the previous bed had been taken by someone else.
0:12:34|0:12:43|He instantly understood and turned to run towards the nurse's station.
0:13:38|0:13:50|Listening to the conversation between the two, he ultimately didn't have the courage to barge in. He understood that he had dragged down Liu Qing. In the quiet hospital at night, [Zheng Kaisi] stood by his mother's bed, just opened a box of instant noodles, only to find the water bottle was empty. Just then,
0:13:50|0:14:0|Liu Qing suddenly appeared. Looking at the lunchbox handed by Liu Qing, [Zheng Kaisi] stubbornly said.
0:14:16|0:14:35|[Zheng Kaisi] refused for the first time. Liu Qing's hand froze in mid-air for a long time, then placed the money on the bedside table, turned around to help [Zheng Kaisi]'s mother tidy up the bed. [Zheng Kaisi] noticed the designer bag placed by the bed.
0:14:46|0:15:6|He paused and said. [Li Jun] stopped his hand movement, stunned for a moment, turned his head to look at the unusual [Zheng Kaisi] walking towards him, looking down at him. [Zheng Kaisi] raised his head in confusion, staring straight at [Li Jun].
0:15:7|0:15:22|Liu Qing's eyes were filled with tears, unwilling to say more, under Zheng Kaisi's gaze, she turned and left. She made a harsh remark to herself, but unknowingly, she became humble to the dust. Zheng Kaisi's stubborn pride hurt both himself and Liu Qing.
0:15:24|0:15:32|He had to compromise in the face of reality. He breathed a sigh of relief only after watching [Li Qing] leave, then lowered his head to eat dumplings heartily.
0:15:32|0:15:48|Worn out until now, he finally realized how passive he was, how vulnerable he was. Everything that happened today, his mother was treated unfairly, [Li Jun] endured humiliation and burden for himself, each incident stabbed into his heart like a knife.
0:15:49|0:15:54|He suddenly stood up, pulled a chair and sat by [Zheng Kaisi's Mother]'s bed, with a sense of grievance and unwillingness.
0:16:20|0:16:39|[Zheng Kaisi] couldn't help but burst into tears, covering his mouth and trembling uncontrollably. [Zheng Kaisi's Mother] remained unresponsive, but a smile never left her face. After calming himself down, [Zheng Kaisi] spoke. He casually wiped the tears from his face with the bandaged hand, his gaze...
0:16:39|0:16:48|He gradually became more determined, as if he had made a decision, and got up to walk outside. He stood on the rooftop at the end of the corridor and dialed [Li Jun]'s number.
0:16:58|0:17:9|The next day, Li Jun rushed to the hospital eagerly, and the two sat by Zheng Kaisi's Mother's bedside.
0:17:10|0:17:19|[Zheng Kaisi] pressed his mother's hand for a palm print, but still couldn't rest assured.
0:17:25|0:17:39|[Zheng Kaisi] stared into [Li Jun]'s eyes, just as he was about to take out the house deed, [Li Jun] hurriedly snatched it away.
0:17:45|0:17:57|[Li Jun] finished speaking and then turned away. Although [Zheng Kaisi] was skeptical, he chose to believe [Li Jun] because of their years of friendship and his bedridden mother in urgent need of money.
0:17:57|0:18:12|A strange man stood straight in front of the nurse's station, wearing a leather jacket, with tattoos on his cheeks, chin, neck, and even a small braid on his head. [Li Jun] saw him and ran over, handing over the contract and house deed to him.
0:18:12|0:18:25|[Zheng Kaisi] looked at the man and felt more and more strange. Although the man was wearing sunglasses, his expression was cold and stern. Even Liu Qing couldn't help but cast a curious glance.
0:18:25|0:18:35|[Zheng Kaisi] left the hospital, rode his motorcycle onto the overpass, and sped all the way to a small alley. He stopped in front of a convenience store and said to the owner behind the counter.
0:18:37|0:18:53|The boss kept his head down playing mobile games without saying a word, until [Zheng Kaisi] threw the money on the counter, then he moved slowly. [Zheng Kaisi] took out a candy box from his pocket, just as he put the candy in his mouth, he saw a shadow on the glass cabinet in front of him, someone was following him.
0:18:53|0:19:3|The strange man from the hospital before now appears behind [Zheng Kaisi]. When he is discovered, he quickly pulls down his helmet, starts the motorcycle, and speeds forward to catch up with [Zheng Kaisi].
0:19:3|0:19:13|As they passed by each other, [Zheng Kaisi] looked puzzled and stared at the man closely, feeling that something was amiss, until the owner of the convenience store slammed the cigarette case heavily on the counter.
0:19:37|0:19:46|He glanced at the dirty-faced [Meng Xiaopang] next to the old lady, then turned and walked away. The old lady stood there holding the money, her eyes sharp.
0:19:49|0:20:6|At night, [Zheng Kaisi] stood on the rooftop of the hospital ward, repeatedly calling [Li Jun] but no one answered. He leaned against the air conditioner on the edge of the rooftop, lit a cigarette, trying to forget all the worries and anxieties.
0:20:6|0:20:10|Looking at the distant twinkling streetlights, he couldn't help but fall into contemplation. In the blink of an eye, the sky brightened.
0:20:37|0:20:50|Li Jun's panicked voice completely extinguished Zheng Kaisi's drowsiness. It instantly shattered his resolve. He seemed to hear the sound of his heart beating violently, everything around him began to spin, and the surrounding voices...
0:20:50|0:21:10|It's like being magnified countless times, swirling around his ears, the jumping pen tip in the hands of [Doctor], the water accidentally spilled by the patient's family, the wind-up doll in the clown's hand, the rushing subway, the black-clothed man who suddenly broke into the house when he was a child, the needle piercing the skin, the rotten apple, the effervescent tablet in the water cup, the patient being rescued,
0:21:10|0:21:24|The second hand on the clock. The sound lingered in his ears like a curse. In the pouring rain, he arrived at the entrance of [Li Jun]'s company, still unable to regain his composure.
0:21:44|0:21:52|[Zheng Kaisi] took out his phone, the screen displaying an unknown location.
0:21:56|0:22:11|[Zheng Kaisi] stood up and walked to the window on the left, pulling open the blinds slightly. Looking outside, he saw the man with tattoos on his face standing across the street, staring at him with a cold and eerie gaze.
0:22:11|0:22:25|The scene shifts, [Zheng Kaisi] is blindfolded and taken by a man to a dimly lit basement. In the vast hall, an old man sits in a chair with his back to the two, the man removes [Zheng Kaisi]'s blindfold, and the old man turns around and speaks.
0:22:31|0:22:36|The man on the side puts a wireless earpiece into his ear.
0:24:8|0:24:15|Seeing no reaction from [Zheng Kaisi], Anderson spoke. [Zheng Kaisi] pondered for a moment,
0:24:17|0:24:34|Ando excitedly pushes Zheng Kaisi back into his chair. Anderson walks over and forces him to look ahead. The screens on the wall start playing a video.
0:24:37|0:24:44|In the scene, [Li Jun] is being chased and forced to run forward. After a few steps, he is pushed to the ground and forced to leave his handprint on a piece of paper.
0:26:0|0:26:6|Anderson rubbed his chin and said. Then he reached out to the clock beside him.
0:26:18|0:26:32|Anderson put his finger to his lips, interrupting Zheng Kaisi's question, signaling to him that time was running out. Zheng Kaisi looked at the clock and suddenly became flustered. Liu Qing's face appeared before his eyes.
0:26:38|0:26:52|[Zheng Kaisi's Mother] lying in the hallway, the back view of Liu Qing walking away keeps appearing in Zheng Kaisi's mind, haunting him. As the time comes, [Anderson] presses the button on the alarm clock, ready to take away the contract on the table.
0:26:52|0:27:2|[Zheng Kaisi] held onto the contract, silent with his head down, looking up at [Anderson]. [Anderson] tactfully handed the pen to [Zheng Kaisi], as if he had already anticipated the outcome.
0:27:2|0:27:17|Upon seeing [Zheng Kaisi] sign his name, [Anderson] smiled and said. His head was covered again with a hood, and [Zheng Kaisi] was sent back. Arriving at the hospital, [Zheng Kaisi] dragged [Li Jun], who was working, to the rest area and said.
0:27:54|0:28:5|[Liu Qing] angrily patted [Zheng Kaisi]. [Zheng Kaisi] put away his smile, looked at [Liu Qing] seriously, took out the hand-woven bracelet and placed it in [Liu Qing]'s hand.
0:28:8|0:28:13|Liu Qing looked up, puzzled, and looked at Zheng Kaisi. Zheng Kaisi's eyes dodged.
0:28:30|0:28:47|Liu Qing grabbed Zheng Kaisi's collar, his voice trembling constantly, as Zheng Kaisi slowly spoke.
0:29:17|0:29:26|After [Liu Qing] left, [Zheng Kaisi] stood foolishly in place, tears of helplessness swirling in his eyes. He then went to [Zheng Kaisi's Mother]'s bedside and placed his hand on hers.
0:29:26|0:29:41|Ando suddenly appeared at the corridor, Zheng Kaisi knew he was running out of time, so he patted Zheng Kaisi's Mother's hand, picked up the bag, and walked outside. Soon he and over a dozen other game participants were taken to an underground parking lot.
0:29:41|0:29:45|Ando scans their documents with a few men in black.
0:29:51|0:29:57|Ando directed the black-clad men around him to take out a box.
0:30:2|0:30:22|Without a word, the man in black forcefully inserted the needle into the neck of a man in the front row, who groaned in pain. After injecting the drug, the man immediately fell into a deep sleep and was dragged away by another man in black, who put him into a car. The crowd started to panic, with everyone in a state of fear and chaos.
0:30:22|0:30:33|Only one man in a white suit remained calm and indifferent as he looked at the crowd. A fly flew past [Zheng Kaisi], and the sound of its wings flapping was amplified countless times in an instant.
0:30:33|0:30:45|Zheng Kaisi's gaze followed the shadow of a fly to the side. Unconsciously, the man in black was already standing in front of him, preparing the syringe. Zheng Kaisi, however, grabbed the syringe in his hand.
0:30:45|0:31:0|Thrust out, pushing away the person next to him and turning to run, several men in black hurriedly chased after him. [Zheng Kaisi] tried to pull open the car door beside him, but it didn't budge. After trying one by one, he finally found an unlocked car and quickly got into the driver's seat.
0:31:0|0:31:13|He didn't dare to hesitate, skillfully started the engine. The engine roared, ready to go. In the next second, the car was speeding wildly on the main road of the parking lot, and he was not to be trifled with by several men in black.
0:31:13|0:31:29|Zheng Kaisi immediately rode a motorcycle to chase after them. In a moment, the parking lot was filled with dust, chaos ensued, and the sound of tires rolling over the ground was deafening. [Zheng Kaisi] raced all the way, drove across the overpass, and entered the tunnel. And behind him, the men in black...
0:31:29|0:31:39|Relentlessly pursuing, completely disregarding traffic rules and the vehicles on the road. A figure in black gradually accelerated towards Zheng Kaisi's car. Zheng Kaisi, thinking quickly,
0:31:39|0:31:49|Pushed against the wall, the man in black couldn't hold on for long. In the next moment, he fell to the ground with his car, and the next second, he was rolled under the big truck behind him.
0:31:49|0:32:8|Instantly, a large fire ignited. Before he could even catch his breath, another figure in black gradually approached, weaving agilely between the wheels. Even as [Zheng Kaisi] kept stepping hard on the gas pedal, the figure in black caught up. A large truck stood between the two, but [Zheng Kaisi] did not notice the figure in black attempting to overtake abruptly.
0:32:8|0:32:30|The man in black was waiting at the front of the car, ready to strike. He aimed at [Zheng Kaisi]'s car window, and a steel wire flew out from his hand, shattering the glass and hooking onto [Zheng Kaisi]'s seat. [Zheng Kaisi] was terrified, only then did he see the man in black not far away. He panicked and stepped on the brakes, causing the steel wire to wrap around the front of a large truck. The man in black then threw down his motorcycle, grabbed the steel wire, and took off from the spot, stepping on...
0:32:30|0:32:42|The truck's window crashed straight towards [Zheng Kaisi], at this moment, the truck burst into flames, engulfing the vehicle instantly. After the thick smoke cleared, the man in black and [Zheng Kaisi] were wrestling inside the car.
0:32:42|0:32:51|Shortly after, [Zheng Kaisi] exerted all his strength to kick the man in black along with the car door out. As he drove out of the tunnel, the terrified [Zheng Kaisi],
0:32:51|0:33:14|In a panic, in order to avoid the oncoming vehicles, [Zheng Kaisi] violently turned the steering wheel, broke through the guardrail of the overpass, and landed on the street below the bridge. Pedestrians were scared and fled in all directions. Unexpectedly, a black man suddenly appeared outside the car window, and with one arm smashed the glass. [Zheng Kaisi] also didn't hold back and rammed into the man in black. The man in black lost his balance, fell to the ground, and the motorcycle went out of control, crashing into the side of the street.
0:33:14|0:33:26|In the barbershop window, before the people inside could react, they were knocked down by a huge impact and splashing glass shards. In the ruins, a fly flew out, rapidly flapping its wings.
0:33:26|0:33:44|Fleeing into the next room, passing through the bustling kitchen, the lively restaurant, and the busy construction site, [Zheng Kaisi] suddenly appeared before Zheng Kaisi. His gaze fixed on the fly, as the black-clad figure in front of him was preparing a new syringe.
0:33:44|0:34:3|[Zheng Kaisi]'s fantasy in his mind abruptly stops. Just as the man in black is about to make a move, [Zheng Kaisi] swiftly knocks his syringe away and dashes forward along the path he has envisioned. While [Ando] and his henchmen remain calm, they pick up a nearby syringe gun and take aim at [Zheng Kaisi], hitting their target with precision.
0:34:3|0:34:14|[Zheng Kaisi] stood still, removed the needle from his neck, turned his head to look at [Ando], but his vision was getting blurry. When he regained consciousness, [Zheng Kaisi] found himself
0:34:14|0:34:34|Boarding the ship, pushed by men in black, locked in a cell, a rough number, 078, was stamped on [Zheng Kaisi]'s neck. The iron door of the cell slowly closed, and as [Zheng Kaisi] looked up, he saw several unfamiliar faces staring at him. He looked around in panic at the players in the room.
0:34:34|0:34:46|Filled with caution, under the gaze of several people, [Zheng Kaisi] carefully moved to the wall, where a round glass window was mounted. He wiped the dirt off the glass with his hand.
0:34:46|0:34:58|Looking out the window, what came into view was the boundless sea and the endless night. A huge cruise ship sailed on the sea, its whistle emitting a majestic roar.
0:34:58|0:35:8|The structure of the ship is very complex, looking like a building when viewed from afar, towering into the sky. The top of the cabin is made of glass, and the lights inside the ship shine out, illuminating the entire ship.
0:35:10|0:35:22|Halo shrouded, particularly conspicuous in the dark night, as if possessing a mysterious power, attracting people to explore. The cruise ship is like a steel giant, sailing towards the distance.
0:35:22|0:35:41|At the stern of the ship, the words "Destiny" are written. At this moment, [Zheng Kaisi] and the players on the ship have fallen into a deep sleep, embarking on an unknown journey with Destiny, facing a tough battle ahead. [Zheng Kaisi] and the others are awakened by the ship's whistle, and a message begins to play on the broadcast.
0:35:53|0:36:15|The broadcast was playing on a loop, and the prison doors were opened. People walked out of the rows of cells and flooded into the corridor. At the end of the corridor was a door leading to the hall. They walked towards the hall following the light. At the door, the men in black gave each person a cloth bag as they entered the hall.
0:36:16|0:36:30|[Zheng Kaisi] and the others were all stunned. This place was like a huge casino, with the hall filled with gambling tables, each table accompanied by a referee. The retro and old European-style architecture was paired with crisscrossing steel frames.
0:36:30|0:36:36|It's very eerie. Looking up, a huge cage hangs in the center of the hall, inside
0:39:6|0:39:13|The crowd looked at [Anderson] eagerly, wanting to get an answer. [Anderson] raised an eyebrow and slowly spoke.
0:39:23|0:39:32|Filled with disdain and contempt, everyone looked at each other in panic. [Anderson] continued.
0:40:13|0:40:32|Anderson's words had just fallen, and the countdown timer on the side started ticking, showing 3 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds. The ship slowly sailed towards the open sea. The fate of the group of desperados on board was about to restart on this "Ship of Destiny".
0:40:32|0:40:45|The crowd scattered, some couldn't wait to get to the gambling table, [Zheng Kaisi] panicked, looking around in confusion. A man at the table lost all his chips, howling miserably. He was dragged into a room.
0:40:45|0:41:5|He struggled desperately, waving his unwilling hands. The broadcast was reporting the elimination of the man. The one who defeated him was the man in the white suit from before, number 29. At this moment, a hand was placed on Zheng Kaisi's shoulder. Zheng Kaisi stared at the person in front of him and nodded.
0:42:34|0:42:49|[Zheng Kaisi] understood what [Zhang Jingkun] meant, but hesitated in place. [Zhang Jingkun] patted his back and walked away. At this moment, the broadcast sounded again, and another person was eliminated. [Zheng Kaisi] stared at [Zhang Jingkun]'s back and ultimately decided to take a gamble.
0:42:49|0:43:0|[Zheng Kaisi] found table number 6, walked over, [Li Jun] was sitting on a nearby sofa. When he saw [Zheng Kaisi], he leisurely got up and walked over, nodding at [Zheng Kaisi].
0:43:0|0:43:11|[Zheng Kaisi] couldn't let his guard down as he looked into his eyes, but [Li Jun] maintained a serious expression, trying to dispel [Zheng Kaisi]'s doubts.
0:43:11|0:43:28|[Zheng Kaisi] took out a card, and Zhang Jingkun also took out a card without hesitation and placed it face down on the table. However, [Zheng Kaisi] held the card in his hand, as if going through a great mental struggle before slowly placing the card on top. The man in black turned over Zhang Jingkun's card, revealing a scissor.
0:44:3|0:44:23|The joy was beyond words as he played the cards in the order they had agreed upon, until only two cards were left. But at that moment, the man in black turned to Zhang Jingkun and said. Both of them froze, looking down at the gambling table. Zhang Jingkun, who was supposed to play scissors, unexpectedly played rock.
0:44:23|0:44:30|Zhang Jingkun slapped his own head in frustration and pulled [Zheng Kaisi] aside.
0:44:42|0:44:54|[Zheng Kaisi] stared at Zhang Jingkun, looking at his remorseful expression, and chose to believe him. The two returned to the gambling table again, and Zhang Jingkun took out a card, showing the pattern on it to [Zheng Kaisi].
0:44:58|0:45:13|[Zheng Kaisi] had a cold face, with a fierce look in his eyes. The trust they had just established instantly shattered. The referee turned over their cards, only to reveal that the scissors Zhang Jingkun had just shown to himself.
0:45:13|0:45:28|At this moment, it turned into a piece of cloth, and the black man turned to [Zheng Kaisi]. Zhang Jingkun showed a sinister smile, picked up the playing cards, wanting [Zheng Kaisi] to die with understanding. Like a magician, the cards changed patterns at his will in his hands.
0:45:31|0:45:40|[Zheng Kaisi] has lost his mind. A group of men in black approached and pinned him down on the table, forcibly took his second star off, and handed it to [Zhang Jingkun].
0:45:55|0:46:4|[Zhang Jingkun] finished speaking, got up and put the stars he won on his arms, then left. [Zheng Kaisi] glared at [Zhang Jingkun] fiercely, struggling desperately to get up.
0:46:4|0:46:18|Being firmly held down by the man in black, [Zheng Kaisi] was only released after [Zhang Jingkun] walked away. Beads of sweat rolled down his forehead as he stood up, looking as if his soul had been sucked out of him, and he walked forward slowly.
0:46:18|0:46:30|But he didn't know where to go. The man beside him was being dragged forward by the men in black, the screams piercing [Zheng Kaisi]'s ears, the repeated blows crushing [Zheng Kaisi]'s hope.
0:46:30|0:46:46|Completely shattered, he was once again plagued by hallucinations. The sudden dizziness left him breathless, prompting him to take off the translator by his ear, close his eyes, and pinch the bridge of his nose hard to force himself awake. The clown inside him began to stir once more.
0:46:46|0:47:7|When he opened his eyes again, the scene in front of him became eerie. The people around him cast hungry wolf-like glances at him, their faces twisted and distorted like beasts. [Zheng Kaisi] walked uncontrollably forward, his expression filled with fear and panic. He pushed open a door and rushed in. In the dim and damp room, a group of people...
0:47:7|0:47:25|Seated on the ground. A man glares menacingly at [Zheng Kaisi], his facial muscles twitching as if he's about to pounce. A drop of water slides down from a nearby pipe, landing in a puddle on the floor, creating a small splash. [Zheng Kaisi] looks around, exhales deeply.
0:47:25|0:47:37|Turning around and leaving. He pushed the door open, a strong cold wind rushed in, engulfing the entire room in ice in an instant. [Zheng Kaisi] was lifted off the ground by the wind, losing gravity the next second, and flew out of the door.
0:47:37|0:47:47|In a moment of danger, he clung to the door frame with one hand, but soon his strength failed. By then, the gambling hall outside the door was no longer there.
0:47:47|0:48:5|The boundless black night enveloped [Zheng Kaisi], floating in the sky. The bright moon behind him made [Zheng Kaisi] appear incredibly small in comparison. The roof beside him transformed into a giant claw, grabbing the ant-like [Zheng Kaisi] into its palm. Suddenly, he began to descend, passing through layers of clouds.
0:48:33|0:48:39|Zheng Kaisi, lying on the floor, gradually regained consciousness and slowly got up to ask.
0:48:50|0:49:7|[Zheng Kaisi] was furious, swinging his fists and getting into a fight. The man in black once again pushed [Zheng Kaisi] down onto the gambling table. Seeing this, [Li Jun] hurried forward to explain. The man in black let go of [Zheng Kaisi], and as [Li Jun] tried to help him up, [Zheng Kaisi] pushed away [Li Jun]'s hand with disgust on his face.
0:50:9|0:50:14|Li Jun lowered his head in shame.
0:50:54|0:51:13|Li Jun's expression turned bitter, he lowered his head helplessly and said. Zheng Kaisi looked at the fallen Li Jun with a heart full of anger but nowhere to vent. At this moment, another person was eliminated at a nearby gambling table. A man in Arab attire kept shouting and was then taken away by men in black.
0:51:13|0:51:19|At the same time, the broadcast announced the elimination of this person. [Zheng Kaisi] glanced at the scoreboard above.
0:51:19|0:51:37|He had 323 stones, 322 scissors, and 321 papers. He looked at the timer on the other side, with 1 hour 58 minutes and 28 seconds left. He opened the candy box he carried with him, eating candy while looking at the photo of [Li Jun] inside.
0:52:5|0:52:14|In the rest area, Meng Xiaopang, wearing broken glasses and sportswear, looked at Zheng Kaisi and Li Jun with a cold expression.
0:52:39|0:52:56|[Li Jun] looked at [Zheng Kaisi], hoping he would come up with an idea. [Zheng Kaisi] took out all the remaining cards, and [Meng Xiaopang] took them and looked through them one by one, only to find four scissors and one cloth left. [Zheng Kaisi] took the cards back, but did not notice the slight movement in [Meng Xiaopang]'s hand.
0:53:29|0:53:47|With one card missing, Zheng Kaisi and Li Jun, who realized it, hurried to catch up. Meng Xiaopang, in a panic, bumped into many people along the way, causing a stream of curses. He pushed away a man in front of a gambling table, throwing his cards out. Zheng Kaisi and Li Jun, seeing this, had no choice but to stop in their tracks.
0:53:47|0:54:0|[Meng Xiaopang] The old man opposite him remained expressionless, with a cunning glint in his eyes, calmly responding to the challenge. Several people stared at the cards on the table at the same time, holding their breath, waiting for the outcome. [Meng Xiaopang] revealed his hand,
0:54:4|0:54:28|The old man took out the scissors, revealing a smug smile and sarcastically said. [Meng Xiaopang] looked ashen, his lips trembling, turning to look at [Zheng Kaisi] and [Li Jun]. In the bathroom, [Li Jun] pinned [Meng Xiaopang] against the toilet and started beating him up. [Zheng Kaisi] stood outside, leaning against the sink smoking.
0:54:28|0:54:37|Li Jun, who had vented his anger, walked out panting. Meng Xiaopang trembled and crawled to Zheng Kaisi's feet, kneeling on the ground and praying.
0:56:8|0:56:18|[Zheng Kaisi] interrupted [Li Jun] and what [Meng Xiaopang] said made him suddenly realize something. He stood up and walked to the side, arms crossed in front of him, deeply pondering.
0:57:12|0:57:20|[Zheng Kaisi] closed his eyes, while [Li Jun] and [Meng Xiaopang] anxiously waited by the side. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and came up with a plan.
0:57:41|0:57:50|Confirming with him, [Zheng Kaisi] walked out of the loan office after receiving the money. He bumped into [Li Jun] head-on, unaware that he had already been targeted by someone.
0:58:3|0:58:18|At this moment, the card counter shows 136 stones, 135 scissors, 137 papers. [Zheng Kaisi] hands a bag filled with US dollars to [Li Jun].
0:58:22|0:58:41|Three men approached the Scarred Man, and [Zheng Kaisi] spoke up. The Scarred Man glanced at the three menacing figures, entered [Zheng Kaisi]'s number into the translator, and said. Relying on his five remaining stars, the Scarred Man didn't take [Zheng Kaisi] and his companions seriously at all.
0:58:41|0:58:57|Approaching the gambling table, [Zheng Kaisi] looked at the four cards, pretending to be hesitant. He placed the selected card face down on the table. The bearded man opposite him remained expressionless, tossing the card onto the table without a word, his eyes fixed fiercely on [Zheng Kaisi], his gaze sinister.
0:58:57|0:59:15|The victory is in hand. However, [Zheng Kaisi] has already seen through his thoughts, he used the big beard's arrogant mentality, just to win a chance of survival. The man in black turned over the cards of the two, as expected, the big beard's card was cloth. The three of them were overjoyed.
0:59:36|0:59:45|Li Jun and Meng Xiaopang looked at Zheng Kaisi in confusion and panic. The bearded man glanced at the card counter, pondered for a moment, then returned to the gambling table and spoke.
1:0:4|1:0:15|[Zheng Kaisi] lowered his head, flipping through the cards in his hand. Upon hearing these words, [Li Jun] and [Meng Xiaopang] looked utterly hopeless, while [Zheng Kaisi] methodically arranged the three cards in order.
1:0:16|1:0:27|The bearded man took out a card and placed it on the table. [Zheng Kaisi] picked up the first card with a serious look and played it. He stared at [the bearded man] with determination.
1:0:27|1:0:35|The man in black reveals Meng Xiaopang's card, which is a stone, causing regret among the three. The referee then reveals Zheng Kaisi's card and sees the pattern on it.
1:0:36|1:0:42|[Scarred Man] clenched his fist excitedly. [Li Jun] pulled [Zheng Kaisi] and [Meng Xiaopang] aside, saying.
1:0:50|1:0:58|Li Jun was stunned, not understanding what he was saying. Zheng Kaisi explained helplessly.
1:2:0|1:2:6|The three returned to the gambling table, and Scarred Man asked.
1:2:8|1:2:22|[Zheng Kaisi] shook his head and played the second card, followed closely by [Scarred Man], who placed his card on the table. The referee turned over the cards, confirming [Zheng Kaisi]'s prediction that [Scarred Man]'s card was a cloth. The three of them felt relieved.
1:2:23|1:2:40|[Li Jun] excitedly collects the stars. [Zheng Kaisi] plays the final card, making [Scarred Man] lose his composure, his expression turning increasingly angry. The man in black reveals [Scarred Man]'s card to be a cloth, [Zheng Kaisi] smirks and says.
1:2:40|1:2:48|He flipped the cards and threw them on the table, with [Li Jun] excitedly shouting beside him, [Meng Xiaopang] dancing with excitement, and the bearded man trembling with anger.
1:3:16|1:3:35|Although he still had three stars, unfortunately, he was eliminated early. [Anderson] grabbed the three stars from the cheater's arm, threw them to his henchman, pulled out a gun, and shot the cheater in the forehead. His henchman swiftly carried the body away. As he wiped his hands, [Anderson] said.
1:4:3|1:4:14|Anderson looked at the documents in his hand, his emotions becoming more and more agitated, and he angrily cursed. Anderson ruthlessly humiliated the players present.
1:4:27|1:4:44|After that, [Anderson] turned and left, the broadcast sounded again, and the game continued. Before everyone could come to their senses, they were all sweating profusely. [Zheng Kaisi] realized the seriousness of the situation, panicked, and kept thinking about the next course of action.
1:5:18|1:5:24|[Zheng Kaisi] on the side suddenly spoke up, staring intently at the card counter above, analyzing.
1:5:48|1:5:54|With Zheng Kaisi's explanation, the plan gradually became clear.
1:6:7|1:6:12|[Zheng Kaisi] interrupted [Li Jun], suddenly realizing something, and turned around to speak.
1:7:0|1:7:16|[Zheng Kaisi] finished explaining his plan, took the paper bag from [Li Jun], took out some US dollars and handed them to [Meng Xiaopang], then put some in his pocket and returned the rest to [Li Jun]. The three of them started to act separately, at this moment, the card counter showed on the screen.
1:7:16|1:7:37|117 rocks, 121 scissors, 96 papers. Before long, each of them found players with three stars. Faced with these impeccable conditions, they all nodded in agreement and the plan proceeded smoothly. The three of them met in the restroom.
1:7:50|1:7:57|[Zheng Kaisi] furrowed his brow, [Li Jun] asked. [Zheng Kaisi] looked up and said.
1:9:0|1:9:10|[Zheng Kaisi] always felt something was off, he lowered his head and divided the playing cards into three piles, handing one pile to [Meng Xiaopang], while [Li Jun] pressed down on his hand.
1:9:17|1:9:23|[Zheng Kaisi] stood up. He grabbed [Meng Xiaopang]'s hand and placed a stack of cards on it, saying.
1:9:47|1:10:1|After setting up, [Meng Xiaopang] walked out of the compartment, cautiously looked around, and quickly left. He found an excellent observation spot, leaned against the wall, and stared at the card counter. At this moment, there were only 59 minutes left. Inside the observation room on the second floor,
1:10:42|1:11:1|Li Jun looked up in confusion. Zheng Kaisi recalled the night of his eighth birthday, when he and his parents were sitting at the dining table, and suddenly a whistle outside the door gradually approached, causing his father to turn his head towards the door.
1:11:1|1:11:18|Suddenly, several black-clad men wearing sunglasses burst in. [Zheng Kaisi's Mother] reacted quickly, immediately stepping forward to shield [Zheng Kaisi] in her arms. Before the father could get up, he was pinned down in front of the table. [Zheng Kaisi's Mother] moved back with [Zheng Kaisi], and in the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by the black-clad men.
1:11:18|1:11:27|One person picked up [Zheng Kaisi] and threw him onto the sofa in the living room, covering his head with a cloth. The TV was playing Invincible Clown.
1:11:48|1:11:53|There was a sudden noise outside the door, [Zheng Kaisi] gestured for [Li Jun] to be quiet, and the two of them pushed the door of the compartment open a crack.
1:12:7|1:12:22|Ando heard the noise coming from the compartment and became alert. Just then, Meng Xiaopang pushed the door open.
1:12:50|1:13:2|[Zheng Kaisi] turned around to look at [Li Jun] and [Meng Xiaopang], as if asking them, yet also asking himself. [Li Jun] and [Meng Xiaopang] looked at each other in confusion.
1:13:27|1:13:33|[Zheng Kaisi] was also in a panic, realizing that things had completely spiraled out of control.
1:13:41|1:13:59|At this moment, there are 41 minutes left, with 80 stones, 82 papers, and only 56 scissors rapidly disappearing on the field. The three of them seemed to be deeply trapped in a quagmire.
1:14:3|1:14:11|Seeing [Zheng Kaisi] remain silent, [Li Jun] became anxious and said. With determination, he turned and walked away, prompting [Meng Xiaopang] to speak up.
1:14:23|1:14:34|In this way, Li Jun and Meng Xiaopang both started a competition with others, trying to throw out the rocks they had accumulated before running out of scissors.
1:14:36|1:14:41|Both of them unexpectedly revealed their cards at the same time, causing them to lose all the two backup stars they had.
1:14:41|1:14:56|Standing not far away, [Zheng Kaisi] saw the outcome and closed his eyes in despair, feeling utterly defeated. Everything the three of them had planned so meticulously was now in vain, all their efforts gone to waste, ending up with a complete loss.
1:14:56|1:15:15|Time was passing by minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, there were only 29 minutes left. [Zheng Kaisi], [Li Jun], and [Meng Xiaopang] sat on chairs on the sidelines, with only three stars left, they dared not challenge anyone else to a game. The three of them sat there listlessly, having already given up the struggle.
1:15:15|1:15:23|At this moment, a man with two henchmen walked over, looking very confident, and said.
1:15:35|1:15:40|Recalling what had just happened, the three of them suddenly realized and immediately stood up alertly. [Zheng Kaisi] said.
1:16:7|1:16:15|He placed his left hand on [Zheng Kaisi]'s shoulder and continued speaking. [Anderson] opened his mouth wide.
1:16:54|1:17:9|After speaking, Anderson waited for Zheng Kaisi's decision. Zheng Kaisi lowered his head, his brain working rapidly. At this moment, there were only 28 minutes left. Luca started to get agitated.
1:17:44|1:17:51|Meng Xiaopang looked at Zheng Kaisi with a look of resignation on his face.
1:18:2|1:18:8|Li Jun, gritting his teeth, said.
1:18:15|1:18:30|[Luka] looked at the three people who quickly reached an agreement in front of him, feeling helpless for a moment. He had to take off the translator and turn around to discuss with his henchmen. [Zheng Kaisi] took advantage of the waiting time to closely watch [Luka] and carefully ponder his thoughts. As for [Li Jun],
1:18:30|1:18:45|With a furrowed brow and a look of worry on his face, [Luca] finally convinced his little brother and turned to [Zheng Kaisi]. Seeing Zheng Kaisi's hesitation, [Luca] patted his shoulder.
1:18:49|1:18:56|Proudly said. After some contemplation, [Zheng Kaisi] quickly agreed. Once a consensus was reached,
1:18:58|1:19:13|Six people arrived aggressively at an empty gambling table, with two groups led by [Zheng Kaisi] and Luca respectively, and the battle was about to begin. Luca wore all three stars, which were the stakes, on his arms, with both hands on the table.
1:19:13|1:19:27|[Zheng Kaisi] looked fearless and determined in his eyes as he met Luca's arrogant gaze, without any hesitation, he played his cards first. Luca tilted his head and raised a card with his right hand, a hint of disdainful smile in his eyes.
1:19:27|1:19:46|At that moment, his two eyeballs suddenly burst out, his neck stretched several times, instantly turning into a monster over two meters tall. He snarled at [Zheng Kaisi], as if the next second he would tear the person in front of him to shreds. [Zheng Kaisi] hurriedly reached out to block the saliva and demonic wind splashing towards him. After the calm was restored,
1:19:46|1:19:52|Luca's face changed suddenly, and he wanted to destroy the cards.
1:19:57|1:20:4|Luca tried to explain, but was sternly stopped by the referee. His henchman approached and asked, and Luca said.
1:21:55|1:21:59|[Zheng Kaisi] held the scissors in his hand and threw it towards the three people opposite.
1:21:59|1:22:26|And Luca's face had already turned pale, the fierce momentum from earlier completely gone. He gasped and glared fiercely at [Zheng Kaisi]. At this moment, [Zheng Kaisi] seemed to once again transform into an invincible clown monster, returning to that subway car full of monsters, back to that seemingly never-ending, brutal game of combat with the endless monsters in the car. And at this moment, Luca also transformed back into a monster in the game.
1:22:26|1:22:30|Until the referee turned over his cards, sure enough, it was a cloth.
1:22:46|1:22:54|[Zheng Kaisi] looked at him pitifully and did not refuse. Luca lost the game, and [Zheng Kaisi] walked up to him and whispered.
1:23:21|1:23:36|Luca saw the two accomplices going upstairs and became furious. After calming down, Luca nodded and said.
1:24:20|1:24:29|[Zheng Kaisi] flashed an innocent smile. Luca, feeling helpless, had to go borrow money. Luca forcefully slapped the paper bag filled with US dollars onto [Zheng Kaisi]'s body.
1:24:30|1:24:44|[Zheng Kaisi] leaned against the wall, not bothering to lift his head as he heard these words. He counted the money in the bags, turned to look at Luca's angry figure, and couldn't help but roll his eyes.
1:25:9|1:25:14|Upon hearing Zhang Jingkun's voice again, [Zheng Kaisi] suppressed his anger and turned around to speak.
1:25:15|1:25:25|Zheng Kaisi withdrew his hand again. [Zheng Kaisi] chuckled coldly and sarcastically.
1:25:42|1:25:49|[Zheng Kaisi] was about to turn around, but was grabbed by Zhang Jingkun.
1:26:18|1:26:26|[Zheng Kaisi] violently chopped off Zhang Jingkun's hand and then walked away.
1:26:37|1:26:54|[Zheng Kaisi] turned around to see Zhang Jingkun reaching out his trembling hand, with a hint of pleading in his stubborn eyes. [Zheng Kaisi] walked up, lifted the hand, but only closed it and walked away, completely extinguishing his hope.
1:26:56|1:27:15|[Zheng Kaisi] turned a deaf ear and went to meet up with [Li Jun] and [Meng Xiaopang]. [Li Jun] leaned down and whispered in [Zheng Kaisi]'s ear.
1:27:37|1:27:50|Time passed by minute by minute, and the remaining players in the hall became more and more cautious. The game proceeded at a steady pace, with Zheng Kaisi and the other two closely watching the card counter. Everything was ready.
1:27:52|1:28:1|Only waiting for the east wind. In no time, the number of cloths has changed from 39 to 37. The three of them walk towards the center of the hall, with [Zheng Kaisi] glancing back at [Li Jun].
1:28:1|1:28:10|[Li Jun] quickly handed over the clothes in his hand, concealing the playing cards in [Zheng Kaisi]'s hand. Unexpectedly, Zhang Jingkun intercepted halfway, pointing to the number on his own neck.
1:28:37|1:28:44|Li Jun was frightened, but [Zheng Kaisi] calmly met Zhang Jingkun's provoking gaze without fear.
1:29:22|1:29:30|The scene suddenly quieted down, Zhang Jingkun breathed a sigh of relief. Everyone fell into panic.
1:29:39|1:29:57|Li Jun looked panic-stricken at [Zheng Kaisi] and [Meng Xiaopang], seeing that neither of them took action, he could only stand by anxiously. Zhang Jingkun looked at [Zheng Kaisi] with a sly smile. Above the Destiny, the night sky was still endless, but danger was gradually enveloping the entire ship.
1:29:57|1:30:5|In the hall, 15 players are sitting in a circle, with Zheng Kaisi sorting the cards he has collected.
1:30:24|1:30:40|As soon as the words fell, the players around nodded in agreement. [Zheng Kaisi] on the sofa beside angrily raised his head, closed the candy box in his hand, and stood up to walk into the crowd.
1:30:44|1:30:51|Zhang Jingkun asked knowingly. He snorted when he saw the large stack of cards that [Zheng Kaisi] took out.
1:31:8|1:31:26|Zhang Jingkun spread out the neatly arranged cards on the ground, with the anxious eyes of the surrounding players. He repeatedly shuffled and overlapped the cards. His shuffling technique was extremely skillful, appearing flawless. Everyone secretly prayed to be dealt good cards. After shuffling the cards,
1:31:26|1:31:33|Zhang Jingkun distributed the original number of cards to everyone, then stood up and walked towards [Zheng Kaisi] with the remaining cards in hand.
1:31:33|1:31:49|Just as [Zheng Kaisi] reached out to catch it, Zhang Jingkun threw the playing cards into the air, flashing a sinister smile at [Zheng Kaisi]. Dozens of cards scattered from the air, as Zhang Jingkun provocatively opened his arms and shouted.
1:31:51|1:32:3|Li Jun and Meng Xiaopang hurriedly picked up the playing cards on the ground, while Zheng Kaisi stared at Zhang Jingkun and slowly stood up. Zhang Jingkun sneered.
1:32:3|1:32:16|He walked past [Zheng Kaisi], his eyes sending shivers down one's spine. At this moment, [Zheng Kaisi] was already furious, his fierce gaze as if wanting to torture Zhang Jingkun inch by inch. Other players.
1:32:16|1:32:34|The competition has already begun in a race against time, but [Zheng Kaisi] and the other two are still sorting out the scattered playing cards. [Zheng Kaisi] anxiously watches the decreasing numbers on the card counter. Meanwhile, Zhang Jingkun has found a new target and won the stars from the man with long hair, turning to look behind him.
1:32:35|1:32:41|The three frantic individuals, [Zheng Kaisi], sneered disdainfully and walked away.
1:33:4|1:33:16|As soon as the words fell, a player behind him was taken away by the black-clothed men for losing the game. At this moment, Zhang Jingkun is trying to deceive a man in a duckbill cap.
1:33:27|1:33:32|Zhang Jingkun immediately rolled his eyes and remained silent. [Zheng Kaisi] then turned to the person wearing a duckbill cap next to him.
1:33:48|1:33:55|[Zheng Kaisi] looked coldly at Zhang Jingkun, but Zhang Jingkun went all out to pretend to be a good person, walking up to [Zheng Kaisi] and speaking.
1:35:1|1:35:11|Seeing that his conspiracy was about to be exposed, Zheng Kaisi's face turned ugly, but he forced a big smile to hide his anger.
1:35:27|1:35:37|With these words, Zheng Kaisi was dumbfounded, while the man in the duckbill cap quickly took out his last card, revealing a subtle crease in the lower left corner.
1:35:38|1:35:46|Before the shuffle, Zhang Jingkun had already secretly made marks. [Zheng Kaisi] looked at the man in the duckbill cap and asked.
1:35:48|1:35:56|The man in the duckbill cap finally came to his senses, looking at Zheng Kaisi with lingering fear. Zheng Kaisi breathed a sigh of relief.
1:36:36|1:36:49|In front of [Zheng Kaisi], three cards were placed upside down on the table, surrounded by a group of players watching the game. The man in the duckbill cap pointed to one of them with a serious expression, and the referee stepped forward to flip it over, revealing a rock.
1:36:52|1:37:6|In the despairing sigh of the man in the duckbill cap, the referee announced the result of the game and turned over the remaining two cards. Seeing this, the man in the duckbill cap had no choice but to admit defeat and hand over the stars. [Zheng Kaisi] rearranged the three cards.
1:37:6|1:37:18|Another player joined the game of [Zheng Kaisi], he decisively chose the card in the middle, and when he saw the scissors on it, he excitedly clenched his fist and embraced his companion next to him in celebration.
1:37:24|1:37:31|The blond across from him trembled as he raised his arm and pointed to the card on the far right, then excitedly shouted.
1:38:2|1:38:9|Zhang Jingkun ignored [Zheng Kaisi] and continued on his determined path.
1:39:5|1:39:20|With that, [Zheng Kaisi] looked at Zhang Jingkun with a smile in his eyes, then patted his shoulder and left. His gaze turned icy in the moment of turning around, intelligence being outwitted by intelligence.
1:39:20|1:39:44|At this moment, Zhang Jingkun was like a clown, being toyed with by [Zheng Kaisi], while the sound of the timer was invisibly pressuring him. Helpless, he had to endure the humiliation and make his way to table 6. Currently, he had 8 stars left on him, along with one card.
1:40:0|1:40:5|With only two minutes left before the end of the game, [Zheng Kaisi] calmly analyzed the situation.
1:41:11|1:41:30|[Zheng Kaisi] comforts the worried [Li Jun] beside him, randomly picks a card from a stack of cards and holds it in his hand. Then he turns his head and coldly looks at Zhang Jingkun. With no other choice, Zhang Jingkun reaches out and takes five stars from his arm, angrily throws them on the table, and plays his last card.
1:41:30|1:41:53|[Zheng Kaisi] coldly snorted and looked mockingly at Zhang Jingkun, hatred surging in his mind. He deliberately delayed, and said coldly. With these words, everyone turned to look at Zhang Jingkun in unison. Zhang Jingkun maintained his arrogance, glanced around reluctantly, and said.
1:42:0|1:42:7|Hearing [Zheng Kaisi]'s tough tone, Zhang Jingkun felt helpless, but his actions were neither painful nor itchy.
1:42:17|1:42:28|Zhang Jingkun gritted his teeth, looked up at the timer again, with only 15 seconds left until the end of the competition. He took off the translator by his ear and fiercely slapped his own face.
1:42:30|1:42:46|Zhang Jingkun dared to be angry but dared not speak, and soon blood oozed from the corner of his mouth. Nevertheless, he still held his head high, staring intently into [Zheng Kaisi]'s eyes, refusing to show weakness. As the slaps became more vicious, the corners of [Zheng Kaisi]'s mouth turned upwards, relishing the pleasure of revenge.
1:42:48|1:43:4|With only three seconds left, time was running out. Seeing Zheng Kaisi play his card, Zhang Jingkun finally stopped, trembling as he let out a breath. Zheng Kaisi showed the cloth in his hand to Zhang Jingkun, then threw it on the table to mock his previous shameless behavior.
1:43:4|1:43:15|At the same time, the timer stopped at zero hours, zero minutes, and zero seconds, and [Zheng Kaisi's Mother] won without any suspense. Zhang Jingkun looked at [Zheng Kaisi] with resentment and turned away.
1:43:15|1:43:25|Upon reaching the safe zone on the second floor, [Zheng Kaisi] handed over all five stars he had won to [Li Jun] and [Meng Xiaopang]. He then took on the remaining playing cards himself.
1:43:25|1:43:46|[Zheng Kaisi] was pushed forward by the men in black in front of everyone's eyes. He looked back at [Li Jun], placing all his hopes on him, confidently believing that he would be redeemed. At this moment, the broadcast started. The broadcast was playing in a loop. The numbers on the card counter,
1:43:53|1:44:12|The first light of dawn shines on the sea, [Zheng Kaisi] is brought into a dimly lit room filled with discarded clothes. The men in black order him to take off his clothes, leaving him only with a towel to cover himself. Inside the room are other eliminated players, all bare-chested like [Zheng Kaisi].
1:44:12|1:44:18|A Scarred Man sat cross-legged in front of the French window, leisurely speaking.
1:44:25|1:44:44|The people in the room were like zombies, each with hollow eyes, looking disheveled and desperate, waiting for death. [Scarred Man] continued speaking. [Zheng Kaisi] adjusted the towel around his waist and sat down on the floor.
1:44:44|1:44:53|The shoulder blade of [Scarred Man] seems to be injured. An old man with a weak body crawls over and gasps, saying.
1:44:58|1:45:5|Zheng Kaisi recalls the scene he saw in the restroom.
1:46:6|1:46:15|The Scarred Man glanced at Zheng Kaisi's hand, then at his puzzled expression, and continued.
1:46:27|1:46:43|The broadcast sounded again, and everyone's eyes gathered on the high platform on the second floor. [Anderson] leaned on a cane, picked up a remote control, and pressed a button. The glass on the window in the corner of the hall, which was originally opaque, instantly became transparent, revealing the scene inside the dark room.
1:47:18|1:47:32|[Zheng Kaisi] showed off to the Scarred Man next to him, but the Scarred Man was unimpressed, giving a disdainful smile. Anderson announced that Li Jun and Meng Xiaopang, who had ten stars, immediately became the targets of everyone, surrounded by the crowd.
1:47:42|1:47:57|[Li Jun] turned his head and met eyes with [Zheng Kaisi], and had to compromise. [Li Jun] didn't expect that even with such a high bid, it would still be snatched up.
1:48:4|1:48:15|[Li Jun] pointed at [Zheng Kaisi] behind the glass window, removed the extra three stars, and handed them to the man in black. Suddenly, [Meng Xiaopang] reached out and snatched the stars, saying gloomily.
1:50:4|1:50:11|The cries for [Zheng Kaisi] fell on deaf ears. When he opened his eyes again, he had already taken on a different appearance and said, "
1:50:15|1:50:24|[Zheng Kaisi] was dumbfounded, looking at [Li Jun] in disbelief. At this moment, [Li Jun] had already been overwhelmed by desire, with red eyes kneeling on the ground.
1:50:36|1:50:51|With that, [Li Jun] stood up and walked away without looking back. [Zheng Kaisi] pounded the glass in despair and anger, while the [Scarred Man] mocked him on the side.
1:51:33|1:51:47|[Scarred Man] sneered at [Zheng Kaisi] as he walked towards the door. Unexpectedly, [Zheng Kaisi] lost his mind and charged at [Scarred Man] like a madman, punching him to the ground.
1:51:47|1:52:3|Straddling him, continuously punching his face. Before long, the man in black rushed in and pinned down [Zheng Kaisi]. With blood all over his face, [Scarred Man] got up, spat at [Zheng Kaisi], picked up the money bag, and hurriedly left.
1:52:5|1:52:18|The old man expressed concern on the side. [Zheng Kaisi] remained silent, gritting his teeth and sitting up straight, his eyes filled with boiling blood as he gasped and said.
1:53:30|1:53:46|Scarred Man was stunned, turned his head and found the bandage on his shoulder had disappeared. The three of them were dumbfounded, looking at each other. Scarred Man's pupils dilated, he suddenly turned around and saw Zheng Kaisi standing by the window, unfolding the tightly clenched piece of bandage, inside.
1:53:49|1:53:57|The companions didn't bother to find trouble with the [Scarred Man] and quickly took out three stars to hand over to the man in black, requesting to ransom [Zheng Kaisi].
1:54:20|1:54:28|The old man wept bitterly, but [Zheng Kaisi] ignored him and walked away indifferently. Seeing this, the old man pleaded.
1:55:25|1:55:31|He rushed into the hall and punched [Meng Xiaopang] in the face, roaring and venting his anger wildly.
1:55:37|1:55:46|Companion, at this moment, [Meng Xiaopang] in his eyes is no different from those monsters on the subway. He once again becomes a clown, returning to the original subway car, leveling up and fighting monsters all the way.
1:55:53|1:56:12|Another heavy blow landed, and Meng Xiaopang's glasses fell to the ground. He was beaten up, his face bruised. Zheng Kaisi, having vented his emotions, was like a clown who had just made his way through the subway turnstile - manic yet incredibly clear-headed. He took the money bag from Meng Xiaopang's hand, stood up, and looked down at him threateningly.
1:56:14|1:56:30|Meng Xiaopang could no longer speak, tremblingly reached out his hand to hand three stars to Zheng Kaisi. Li Jun felt ashamed to face Zheng Kaisi.
1:56:34|1:56:52|Facing the questioning from [Zheng Kaisi], [Li Jun] couldn't say a word for a long time, just shamefully shrugging his head. Without saying a word, [Zheng Kaisi] took back the money bag from [Li Jun], and slowly walked to the window of the small dark room, pointing inside to the onlookers around.
1:56:52|1:57:1|The lonely old man. [Zheng Kaisi] handed three stars to the man in black, and the old man limped to the window.
1:57:20|1:57:25|The old man wept uncontrollably, his frail body trembling uncontrollably.
1:57:28|1:57:38|[Zheng Kaisi] did not respond, showing no emotion, and turned away. His face was covered in bloodstains, his eyes sharp, as he walked to the center of the hall.
1:57:39|1:57:46|He suddenly looked up and glanced at Anderson in the observation room. Anderson stood by the window, met Zheng Kaisi's gaze, and said, "Interesting."
1:57:47|1:58:5|At this moment, the sun rises in the east, but the sky seems to be shrouded in a hazy veil. The massive Destiny ship is docked at the pier, with a row of cars parked next to the steamship, waiting for passengers to disembark. [Scarred Man]'s two companions and the man in the white suit are all in the queue.
1:58:5|1:58:30|[Zheng Kaisi] carrying a backpack, his face filled with exhaustion, turned his head to look at the Destiny, showing no emotion on his face, yet feeling lost inside. In just one night, he was reborn in this hellish game, he won, but stepped on the blood of countless people. He deluded himself into changing the rules of the animal world, but could not change the human nature of survival of the fittest.
1:58:30|1:58:50|In the hospital, Li Jun is by the sink, bending over to wash her hair. With her eyes closed, she skillfully reaches for the shampoo. The busyness of work forces her to speed up her movements. At this moment, someone quietly approaches from behind and reaches towards the sink, dripping some fake blood into the water.
1:58:50|1:59:5|Li Jun, however, was completely unaware and continued to wash her hair. When she opened her eyes, the sight of blood in front of her terrified her, and her screams echoed in the hospital corridor. Li Jun stood up and quickly wiped the water off her face with her hands.
1:59:25|1:59:42|The two of them looked at each other in silence, [Zheng Kaisi] bowed his head to suppress his emotions, then rushed forward and embraced Li Jun. He could no longer control his emotions, his arms tightening around Li Jun, who leaned against [Zheng Kaisi]'s chest, trembling slightly.
1:59:55|2:0:8|The two embraced tightly, feeling the hard-won reunion. He looked out the window, the sunlight unusually gentle. He couldn't help but hold the person in his arms even tighter.
2:0:32|2:0:54|The film is about to say goodbye to you here. Thank you for listening. The final part of the film will bring you a post-credits scene. Now let me tell you about the post-credits scene. In the early morning,
2:0:54|2:1:6|The entire ward was very quiet, and [Zheng Kaisi's Mother]'s bed had been moved back to the ward. [Zheng Kaisi] sat on a chair next to the hospital bed, sound asleep from a night of vigilance, exhausted.
