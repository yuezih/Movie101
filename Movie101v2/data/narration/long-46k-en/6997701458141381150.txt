0:2:39|0:2:46|With the solemn voice of the envoy, General Aspar and his entourage arrived at the foot of the giant Buddha in a carriage.
0:3:16|0:3:25|Entering the pagoda, a massive bronze pillar reaching the sky and the earth stood before them. [General Aspar] looked up, but couldn't see its top.
0:3:40|0:4:1|The giant Buddha statue is made of copper and iron, with no ventilation. It is currently in the midst of rush construction, with many craftsmen working on it. The heat is unbearable due to the exposed molten metal. Passing by a copper pillar, [General Aspar] leans against a wooden support to observe. The copper body is covered with paintings from top to bottom, leaving [General Aspar] puzzled. He opens his mouth to ask.
0:4:33|0:4:40|They looked around hesitantly and finally elected a round-faced man.
0:4:42|0:5:0|The speaker is the Minister of Works, [Jia Yi], who is also the one who supervised the construction of this sixty-six zhang tall Floating Tower. As the gears were turned by a dozen spirited horses, the few people standing in the wooden box slowly ascended.
0:5:16|0:5:21|In the meantime, the overseer and [Jia Yi] had reached the top level of the Great Buddha Temple, where [Jia Yi] continued to explain.
0:6:2|0:6:10|Having dealt with the overseer, [Jia Yi] smiled and walked towards the general. Just as she entered the Buddha's tomb, she suddenly felt dizzy and said slowly.
0:6:15|0:6:38|So the group of people crossed the mountains and arrived at the platform built under the floating pagoda. Just as [Jia Yi] said, the weather was clear today. Standing here, one could see Luoyang in the distance. General [Aspar] spoke, "The grand construction is built within the project, overlooking the Hall of Enlightenment. The imperial court appears magnificent."
0:6:39|0:6:55|Just at that moment, before the translator Shangguan Jing'er could finish speaking, flames suddenly burst out on Jia Yi's face, emitting thick black smoke. Upon hearing this, everyone hurriedly dodged backwards, wanting to help but not knowing where to start.
0:6:56|0:7:0|In an instant, Di Renjie's body was engulfed by raging flames,
0:7:4|0:7:19|The searing pain caused him to scream, Jia Yi rushed in and ran onto the platform inside the giant Buddha, but the intense fire blinded him, making him unable to see. He stumbled and fell down the central pillar before the onlookers could rescue him from the fire.
0:7:19|0:7:41|Although the giant Buddha towered over sixty-six zhang and more, it only took a moment for it to collapse. In just a few seconds, Jia Yizhi's body was burned to ashes, leaving behind countless pieces of charred bones at the foot of the Buddha. The officials, envoys, and workers present could not hide their astonishment and fear in their eyes.
0:7:42|0:7:59|Empress Wu is about to declare herself emperor and intends to build the Tower of Divine Might to show her power to the world. However, a shocking incident has occurred: the Assistant Minister of Works, [Yu Qing], publicly self-immolated in front of foreign envoys. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, [Xue Yong], immediately led a team to the scene to investigate.
0:7:59|0:8:8|The Dali Temple is the highest judicial institution of the Tang Dynasty, responsible for handling all criminal cases and investigations.
0:8:24|0:8:30|Upon arriving at the pagoda, Di Renjie and his companions noticed that the craftsmen were all uninterested in construction, instead standing around watching.
0:9:1|0:9:7|[Xue Yong] had just finished speaking when the man in black sheathed his sword. With a loud shout, he jumped off the platform and looked around at everyone, saying,
0:9:54|0:10:2|The room erupted in an uproar as the words were spoken, with servants either grimacing in complaint or shoving and cursing. The man in black is known as [Pei Donglai], in his prime but holding the position of Assistant Minister of Justice.
0:10:20|0:10:33|Pei Donglai moved forward and subdued the overseer, examining his left hand. He noticed a copper hook sleeve revealing a severed hand.
0:10:47|0:10:56|[Pei Donglai] smirked and exerted a bit of force on the overseer Xiang's back, casually tossing the bronze hook into the stable.
0:11:38|0:11:48|Upon hearing Di Renjie's words, Xue Yong followed his pointing finger and looked towards the central pillar, where two pages of talismans were lifted, revealing the true appearance of the bronze pillar.
0:11:48|0:12:10|[Pei Donglai] hesitated for a moment upon hearing the words, then reached out to take the peace charm painted by the national teacher. Just as he was about to grab it, Xue Yong quickly stepped forward and tore off the talisman. Feeling slightly uneasy, [Pei Donglai] confronted Xue Yong and forcefully tore off the second talisman.
0:12:21|0:12:28|At a command, the relevant people were all shackled and placed under the pagoda, [Pei Donglai] was about to interrogate the overseer, but then heard Xue Yong speak.
0:12:35|0:13:2|Xue Yong and others galloped towards the imperial city. In the inner city training ground, the walls of the corner tower were covered with numerous divine signs, while the drumbeat echoed outside the city tower's literary cave. A woman stood on the training ground wearing a suit of golden armor, with a peony phoenix crown on her head, surrounded by many generals and soldiers. She was none other than the empress dowager [Wu Zetian].
0:13:24|0:13:54|Witnessing [Wu Zetian] wave her hand, the majestic aura of a dragon converges with the grandeur of a phoenix. On the other side, Xue Yong rides his horse on the training ground, feeling the scorching heat of the sun. [Pei Donglai] dismounts and kneels before [Wu Zetian], while a distant scream is heard. A man on a spirited horse, engulfed in smoke, turns out to be the skeptical Xue Yong. A female guard beside [Wu Zetian] speaks up.
0:13:56|0:14:6|Immediately after withdrawing before the imperial carriage, there was smoke swirling around him, his face contorted and terrifying. The female guard observed his actions and realized that he was heading straight towards [Wu Zetian].
0:14:6|0:14:28|So the groom raised his whip to block the way, facing the source of fire, and finally stopped it in front of the imperial carriage. [Di Renjie] fell under the horse, and a female guard, being hit by the force, lost her balance. The soldiers then reacted, surrounding [Di Renjie] with their horses, but none dared to risk their lives to save him, allowing the fire to consume [Di Renjie] almost completely.
0:14:28|0:14:33|After nightfall, heavy rain poured down, thunder striking the pagoda, causing fear in the hearts of everyone.
0:14:57|0:15:11|In the study, before the six ministries presented their memorials, [Wu Zetian] reclined on the couch, while the attendants floated in a boat towards the palace in the early hours of the morning. Upon meeting, they showered her with countless compliments, but [Wu Zetian] spoke frankly,
0:15:18|0:15:26|The speaker has a delicate face, with a charming and gentle appearance, but surprisingly, she is the female bodyguard who sacrificed herself to protect the master on the training ground earlier.
0:16:12|0:16:39|This person, known as [Shangguan Jing'er], is a prominent figure by [Wu Zetian]'s side, skilled in martial arts and extremely loyal. She takes care of all aspects of [Wu Zetian]'s daily life. Watching the obedient Jing'er kneeling before her, [Wu Zetian] couldn't help but gently stroke her cloud-like hair. Just as they exchanged smiles as master and servant, a commotion broke out among the palace guards, and a group of palace maids followed [Wu Zetian] to the corridor bridge.
0:16:39|0:16:46|A plum blossom deer stood majestically on the steps of the corridor.
0:17:54|0:18:12|[Wu Zetian] finished speaking, and without waiting for Jing'er to question further, she left. Words spoken by the empress must not be contradicted, so Jing'er changed into plain clothes and that very night rode her horse to the place where [Di Renjie] was being tortured. Dismounting, she revealed her waist token.
0:19:4|0:19:11|The young man suddenly stopped in his tracks and hesitated before saying,
0:19:18|0:19:26|The firelight reflected on their faces, only then did they realize that the old and the young had no pupils in their eyes, but relied on hearing to perceive the sound of the wind breaking around them.
0:19:42|0:19:58|As soon as the words fell, a night walker rushed up to the burning platform, lifted the two people around the waist, and threw them directly into the furnace. The two remained calm in the face of danger, using the wooden clogs they were wearing to connect to the outer wall of the incinerator, and then pulling back and throwing themselves backwards. The night walker, unable to control his momentum, rushed towards the incinerator, reaching out and touching the wall of the furnace.
0:19:58|0:20:14|Unexpectedly, the burning furnace never ceases day and night, with the walls scorching hot. In a moment of carelessness, a night traveler is thrown off a high platform. At this moment, the young man reaches into his eyes, squeezing out the two thin films covering them and discarding them on the platform.
0:20:14|0:20:26|The eyes were bright and piercing, showing no signs of blindness, just pretending to be blind. At this moment, all senses were intact, and the young man could see everything in the circle clearly. Two night prowlers with knives were approaching again.
0:20:27|0:20:49|Old Lin controlled the half-burning cart, turned around towards the stage below. Two night travelers who couldn't react in time were knocked down. On the stage, a night traveler drew a ice blade, while the young man used the handcuffs in his hand as a weapon, facing four night travelers alone. He first delivered a powerful punch to the chest of one person, then avoided the knife handle, and kicked the person on the right wing with his legs together.
0:20:49|0:20:57|With the pressure of Mount Tai, he fell onto another person, but when he turned around, he saw a night walker swinging a knife towards Old Lin.
0:21:4|0:21:29|Just as the young man smiled peacefully, two night prowlers, fearless of death, charged forward. [Shangguan Jing'er] heard the noise and rushed over, solemn as snow, moving back and forth like a silver dragon. In her hand was a long whip with a golden python pattern, striking like the wind and fierce as thunder. As she moved up and down, it was like a dance of a golden snake and phoenix. Finally, the guards arrived, drawing their swords and shouting loudly.
0:21:32|0:21:50|The soldiers immediately surrounded [Shangguan Jing'er] to protect her. As soon as the words fell, several arrows came whistling through the air. They hurriedly called on everyone to duck and take cover. The young man remained vigilant against the surrounding assassins, but saw them charging towards the burning house, and shouted.
0:21:55|0:22:7|Taking advantage of the chaos among the guards, the assassins who had arrived at the door lifted their dead or injured companions and threw them into the furnace. Then, they themselves leaped into the raging fire.
0:22:18|0:22:23|The battle ended, the young man led the old Lin down from the burning platform, and they sat on the ground to rest.
0:22:50|0:22:58|[Shangguan Jing'er] stepped forward and reached out to test Lao Lin, but was stopped by the young man who said,
0:23:51|0:24:17|After finishing speaking, Lao Lin stared at [Shangguan Jing'er] with his eyes that had no pupils and smiled sinisterly, as if he could see more clearly despite being blind. It was then realized that the young man was none other than [Di Renjie], known as the Pearl of the Sea and the Southeastern Treasure. The scene gradually faded away in Lao Lin's eerie smile, and the next morning,
0:24:32|0:24:51|Before the Ming Tang, thousands of Imperial Guards stood in formation, the palace was heavily guarded. Two men engaged in combat in the open space, just to catch the attention of the Empress. On Foutu Street, eunuchs and palace maids patrolled, [Shangguan Jing'er] changed into a black robe and knelt before the Empress.
0:25:19|0:25:34|With a hint of surprise and a moment of hesitation, [Shangguan Jing'er] followed the eunuchs and left directly. When the attendants withdrew, the Empress waved her hand as a signal. [Di Renjie] then sat down beside the frame, despite being in prisoner's garb, with a disheveled appearance. However, in facing the Empress, he maintained a calm and dignified demeanor, not losing the aura of a distinguished official.
0:26:20|0:26:40|The two seemed to deliberately avoid the distinction between superior and inferior, and did not mention the past bloody battles. Their casual conversation seemed to set aside the ongoing struggle on the field, catching the attention of [Shangguan Jing'er]. After speaking, she opened [Di Renjie]'s palm, placed a badge inside, and said to him,
0:26:53|0:27:0|Standing in front of the tent, [Shangguan Jing'er] may or may not have heard what the Empress said.
0:27:0|0:27:28|With a pensive expression, the scene shifts to outside the palace walls. The long river runs through the capital, dividing it in two. The river is wide and bustling with boats, while on the shore within the city, the sounds of martial arts competitions fill the air. In the midst of the prosperous Tang Dynasty, with the nation's prestige soaring, clusters of businesses and foreign tourists can be seen everywhere on the streets. [Shangguan Jing'er], holding an imperial decree, leaves the palace with [Di Renjie] to handle a case.
0:27:32|0:27:43|[Di Renjie] knew in his heart that the Empress had reservations about reinstating him, so he arranged for [Shangguan Jing'er] to be by his side, intending to keep an eye on him.
0:28:4|0:28:11|The two walked and talked in the corridors of the Sifang Pavilion, and soon arrived at the room of [Di Renjie].
0:28:20|0:28:29|After saying that, the door behind Di Renjie slowly closed, but Shangguan Jing'er's voice could still be heard.
0:28:34|0:28:58|After that, she walked into the room and directly took off her official attire behind a screen without any hesitation. With a question in the air, [Di Renjie] didn't say much, sitting in front of a bronze mirror. Not long after, [Shangguan Jing'er] changed into women's clothing and emerged from behind the screen. Hearing the movement, [Di Renjie] turned around to check, sizing up the person behind him without much surprise on his face. Instead, he took the initiative to speak first.
0:29:4|0:29:10|[Shangguan Jing'er] had a displeased look on her face. Apart from serving the Empress, she had never served anyone else in the world.
0:29:20|0:29:28|[Shangguan Jing'er] kicked backwards, sending the long whip hanging on the clothes rack into the air. She leaped onto a low table, turned around, and grabbed it.
0:29:28|0:29:39|Taking the long whip into his hand, [Di Renjie] saw [Shangguan Jing'er] charging towards him. He drank a mouthful of cold water and sprayed it on her face, leaving [Shangguan Jing'er] feeling both embarrassed and angry. She swung the long whip towards him, but it was snatched away by [Di Renjie], who then
0:29:39|0:29:54|With the razor in hand, [Di Renjie] leaned back towards [Shangguan Jing'er]'s damp face, tilting his neck to indicate she should shave for him.
0:30:44|0:31:3|After that, [Shangguan Jing'er] turned around and rode on [Di Renjie], then took off the hairpin on her head, causing her hair to flow like a waterfall. Finally, she calmly removed her clothes and stood there exposed. Unexpectedly, [Di Renjie] remained unmoved under her, calmly saying.
0:31:4|0:31:20|Shangguan Jing'er remained silent, took the razor out of her mouth, and asked back. Then she skillfully manipulated the razor like a flower, teasing and undoing the loose prisoner's clothes of Di Renjie beneath her. Just as Shangguan Jing'er was anxiously preparing for another move.
0:31:20|0:31:38|Underneath, [Di Renjie] suddenly embraced her, the two who had only met briefly were now intimately close. Even a heroine like [Shangguan Jing'er] felt weak all over, her martial arts skills turning into nothing. In the fragrant and delicate room, [Di Renjie] handed a long whip to [Shangguan Jing'er].
0:31:38|0:31:50|Shortly after stepping out of the closed door, countless arrows came whistling through the air. The two hurriedly dodged, with [Shangguan Jing'er] dragging her whip close to the ground and hiding behind a beam, then asked a question.
0:31:52|0:32:7|Outside the house, arrows kept coming. After [Di Renjie] finished speaking, he extinguished a candle beside him, then swiftly threw the knife in his hand to extinguish the last light. The room instantly plunged into darkness, causing the assassins outside to lose their target. After shooting wildly into the house, they fell silent.
0:32:7|0:32:28|The two remained unchanged and hidden in the room, suddenly on the side of the window where [Shangguan Jing'er] was, a person was walking with a candle. She turned to look, then followed the light and shadow, chasing to the door. Seeing the person outside with the candle stop, she wanted to open the door to see what was going on. But as soon as she opened a crack, she was pulled back by [Di Renjie] by the shoulder.
0:32:28|0:32:47|Outside the house, countless arrows broke through the air and shot straight at the two of them. In a moment of desperation, [Di Renjie] hung his official robe in front of him, catching the arrows in the flowing robe. As they fell to the ground, just as [Di Renjie]'s arm was about to touch the back of [Shangguan Jing'er]'s head, he immediately, without hesitation, rolled away from the spot, still naked.
0:32:47|0:32:56|[Di Renjie] looked at her with a sense of wonder. This small gesture now seemed like a drop in the ocean compared to before, but [Shangguan Jing'er]'s strong reaction was a mystery.
0:32:56|0:33:23|[Di Renjie] secretly took notice and then caught a glimpse of a clue in the hidden arrows. He then broke open a birdcage at his feet, picked up a small bird with an arrow still in its wing, and examined it in his hand. As the roof tiles moved, [Di Renjie] didn't care about anything else, quickly placed the bird down and turned to chase out of the room. Following the assassin's trail, he arrived at another courtyard, where he saw many guests and heavy guards.
0:34:12|0:34:17|As soon as the words fell, there was a loud explosion in the air, and the military token disappeared. Then a figure descended from the sky.
0:34:48|0:34:54|The guests left with sarcastic remarks, but [Shangguan Jing'er] remained indifferent and spoke directly to [Di Renjie].
0:35:47|0:35:56|[Di Renjie] looked up at the sky, where dark clouds obscured the sun. In no time, [Pei Donglai] led [Di Renjie] and [Shangguan Jing'er] to the morgue.
0:35:59|0:36:10|As soon as the coroner pushed open the door, he heard the constant chirping of a small bird in the cage. [Di Renjie] observed the charred corpse in the room, then looked at the birdcage in his hand, and said,
0:36:11|0:36:24|Pei Donglai, unaware of the deeper meaning, felt helpless and handed the birdcage to a subordinate to look after. The three then entered the morgue, where the coroners lit candles and unrolled a scroll between the two charred bodies, beginning to recite.
0:36:38|0:36:55|[Di Renjie] questioned Pei Donglai to no avail, realizing that this person was cautious in his words and actions, wary of the empress's authority. He then turned to [Shangguan Jing'er] and spoke, to which [Shangguan Jing'er] glanced over and Pei Donglai responded.
0:37:0|0:37:6|[Di Renjie] spoke while placing the badge between the two of them, speaking earnestly. [Shangguan Jing'er] had no choice but to leave.
0:37:13|0:37:27|The so-called evidence is the little sparrow, and the words about closing the door were meant for [Shangguan Jing'er]. Closing the door, [Shangguan Jing'er] stood with a sword behind her, angrily outside the house. Then she came up with a plan, looked up at the roof and continued to ponder.
0:37:39|0:37:47|In the room, the imperial envoy Di Renjie made the coroners read the documents in their hands until they were hoarse. Only then did Di Renjie lean over and whisper in Pei Donglai's ear.
0:37:48|0:37:55|Pei Donglai was quite surprised, carefully examining the person in front of him. The person's face showed wisdom and determination, and he spoke up to probe,
0:38:1|0:38:24|Outside, [Shangguan Jing'er] had already climbed onto the roof. As the two conversed quietly, [Shangguan Jing'er] lifted a roof tile to look inside the house. Although the figure of the person could be seen and their reading could be heard, it was difficult to make out what the two were saying.
0:38:51|0:38:56|Pei Donglai heard these words and knew that the person in front of him was not easily fooled, and was solely focused on solving the case regardless of anything else.
0:39:13|0:39:17|Pei Donglai hesitated to continue, then slightly tilted his head to signal and spoke.
0:39:23|0:39:40|[Di Renjie] nodded solemnly, and Pei Donglai then raised his voice, bursting into laughter. He suppressed the smile on his face and asked [Di Renjie] in return.
0:40:24|0:40:27|When Di Renjie asked in confusion, Pei Donglai, with a smug look on his face, replied,
0:40:29|0:40:42|During the confrontation between [Di Renjie] and [Wu Zetian], as dark clouds dispersed in the sky outside the room, the scorching sun shone into the hall. At that moment, a guard who was watching over a small bird outside suddenly shouted,
0:40:54|0:41:6|[Di Renjie] thought for a moment and then led the group towards the scene. One guard held a black umbrella over [Pei Donglai]'s head as they walked to the kitchen, where [Di Renjie] asked,
0:41:14|0:41:31|Under the ink umbrella, [Pei Donglai] responded to [Shangguan Jing'er] that he did not like the bright sun, perhaps this ink umbrella was the reason for his snowy white appearance. [Di Renjie] walked to the side of the kitchen case, found the bowl of chicken blood placed in front of him, took out two arrows from his arms, and observed that their appearance was exactly the same as the ones used by the assassin last night.
0:41:31|0:41:40|A hidden weapon. The arrowhead twisted and turned, revealing a hollow interior from which a colorless liquid trickled into the bowl of chicken blood.
0:41:58|0:42:13|At this point, [Di Renjie] carried the blood-stained object to the sunny spot, placed it on the table, and bent down to examine it. Seeing the bowl starting to boil, [Di Renjie] waved his hand to signal everyone to step back three feet from the blood bowl. Under the sun's rays,
0:42:13|0:42:29|The blood in the bowl kept splashing, with black smoke swirling above it. People did not yet know its power, so they retreated again to prevent any unnecessary disasters. After a moment, the hot air in the blood surged, causing numerous water bubbles to appear, followed by a loud explosion.
0:42:29|0:42:41|[Pei Donglai] felt the sudden surge of flames in front of him, unbearable. He quickly used an ink umbrella to shield himself. In just a moment, all the fruits and vegetables on the shore were engulfed in flames, revealing the secret of spontaneous combustion.
0:42:41|0:42:59|Three of them came to the Floating Tower of Heaven to search for relevant clues. As Wu Zetian was about to ascend the throne, despite the unsolved murder case, the construction of the tower was still in high demand. Therefore, craftsmen continued to sit inside, next to the water pool. The worker wanted to pour water into the lake, but heard a colleague say so.
0:42:59|0:43:17|The leather flask slipped from the hand and fell into the pool, floating on the water. Just as someone was about to pick it up, a hand reached out, picked up the flask, and placed it in the wall pool. Following that arm, the supervisor's face suddenly froze, showing a complex expression. The person in front of him was none other than [Di Renjie].
0:43:18|0:43:36|The overseer paused after a sudden exclamation and then said, "Take a good look at Di Renjie," Shangguan Jing'er spoke up.
0:43:41|0:43:49|Pei Donglai said to Shangguan Jing'er not far away.
0:43:58|0:44:14|Upon hearing [Shangguan Jing'er]'s proud refusal, she turned and left. In that moment, [Pei Donglai] had a sudden inspiration. He took the copper pot from his waist and placed it near his nose and mouth, finding nothing unusual. However, this simple action triggered a myriad of thoughts, focusing on the water basin nearby.
0:44:14|0:44:25|[Shangguan Jing'er] saw him looking pensive, so she turned around and stood in front of him, asking.
0:45:34|0:45:40|As they walked to the central pillar, [Di Renjie] couldn't help but exclaim.
0:46:10|0:46:25|[Di Renjie] saw some charred bone fragments on a table in the pavilion, stood on the left eye platform of the giant Buddha, and asked, then turned his head and chuckled before replying.
0:47:36|0:47:41|[Shangguan Jing'er] heard the sarcastic remarks and burst into laughter.
0:48:53|0:49:10|The original overseer, known as Shatuo, once worked at the Dali Temple and was a trusted assistant of [Di Renjie]. After bidding farewell to Shatuo, [Di Renjie] and his companions rushed to the entrance of the Ghost Market. On the vast desolate plain, a huge crack meandered endlessly, disappearing into the depths, where a dark river flowed and thin mist lingered.
0:49:10|0:49:18|[Di Renjie] shook a bronze bell in front of him. In a moment, smoke rose above the underground river, and an old man rowed a boat towards them, his voice hoarse as he spoke.
0:49:32|0:49:49|Three people walked on the boat, following the old man into the ghost market. On both sides of the river, there were countless people in tattered robes, hiding their figures. These people, who had long lived underground and rarely seen the light of day, were strangely similar to [Pei Donglai], with fair skin as white as snow and eerie appearances.
0:49:49|0:50:6|They gathered around a stone platform, with several candles lit, feasting on the bodies on the platform without any sense of disgust. As they ate, a person with six arms appeared, playing musical instruments with both hands, the music haunting and melancholic, yet their face remained calm and indifferent, sending chills down the spine. They continued on in silence.
0:50:6|0:50:31|Three people arrived outside a pavilion, where the beams and pillars were disorderly and chaotic with no pattern. Covered in thin mist, it felt like they could collapse at any moment. [Pei Donglai] seemed to understand it well, as he entered the pavilion and called for someone, but there was no response. They followed the sound of pounding medicine into a room, where they saw an old man sitting in front of a furnace, short and bloated, looking filthy.
0:50:31|0:50:37|The old man looked up at everyone and said directly to [Di Renjie],
0:50:45|0:50:53|After saying that, the old man reached into the jar, took out a centipede, and swallowed it.
0:51:11|0:51:32|He threw a jar at [Shangguan Jing'er], and several baby-sized scorpions fell out from under her feet. Upon hearing [Di Renjie]'s words, [Pei Donglai], who had just dealt with those poisonous creatures, took off his money pouch from his waist and placed it on the Dan Ding. [Wang Lu] heard the sound and came over, staring at the gold cakes in the pouch, his eyes shining, and said casually.
0:51:33|0:51:38|As soon as [Di Renjie] said this, [Wu Zetian] immediately became alert, gathering his gaze and hesitating before speaking.
0:51:49|0:51:57|[Di Renjie] squatted in front of Wang Lu, smiling as he waved the gold cake in his pouch in front of him.
0:52:7|0:52:26|At the moment when the two were talking, a strange noise came from the top of the pavilion, and the exotic beast in the cage in the room kept howling. The four looked up and saw a huge bell falling heavily, heading straight towards Di Renjie. In the urgent situation, everyone dodged on their own, raising countless dust.
0:52:26|0:52:43|Amidst the chaos, Wang Lu leaped into the secret passage under the floor and vanished without a trace. [Di Renjie] pushed aside the blocking bronze bell with all his might, followed closely by jumping into the passage. On the other side, [Pei Donglai] reached the steps, raised his head to observe, and saw shadows moving among the intertwined beams. He then spoke,
0:52:44|0:52:59|When about to investigate, feeling no one following behind, he turned around and shouted at [Shangguan Jing'er]. [Shangguan Jing'er] entered the secret passage, so the crowd gave up chasing the assassin and instead tracked Wang Lu to ensure his safety.
0:52:59|0:53:19|On the other side of the underground river, Di Renjie sat in a boat prepared in advance, paddling forward. After a smooth glide, Di Renjie suddenly felt a chill under his feet. He looked down and saw a small hole in the bottom of the boat, through which water was rushing in frantically. Just as Di Renjie was about to start clearing the water in the cabin, a huge wooden stake suddenly flew out from the underground river.
0:53:19|0:53:37|The boat collided with the stern, causing it to sway violently. Before Wang Lu could react, he saw a series of wooden stakes flying out from under the water, directly hitting the boat into the air and then crashing back onto the water. Startled, Wang Lu looked up to see more than ten wooden stakes falling from the sky, smashing into the water and creating countless waves.
0:53:37|0:53:57|Just as Di Renjie was relieved that he was unharmed after the attack, he saw countless wooden stakes falling from the sky. This time, a person stood on top of a stake and then fell down, overturning Di Renjie's boat and smashing it into the water. The person was tall and muscular, wearing a blood-red robe and a sinister ghost mask on his face, looking mysterious and terrifying.
0:53:57|0:54:16|He saw Wang Lu preparing to escape, so he flew up in a tiger-claw stance, pressing directly towards Wang Lu's back. The palm wind was strong, and the several-inch-thick plank was shattered like foam. The masked man grabbed Wang Lu, but found himself unable to drag him over with such strange strength. When he turned around, he found a person standing in front of Wang Lu, who was none other than [Di Renjie].
0:54:16|0:54:31|At this critical moment, he quickly snatched Wang Lu from the hands of the ghost-faced man, then joined forces with the two companions who arrived, only to find that the ghost-faced man was incredibly strong, even facing three opponents at once without falling behind. [Shangguan Jing'er] wielded her long whip like a swimming dragon, forcibly tearing off one of the ghost-faced man's arms.
0:54:31|0:54:52|Entangled with [Di Renjie], the pressure suddenly decreased. Unexpectedly, after the arm detached from the body, it transformed into two blood-robed monsters hidden in the dark cave walls, shooting arrows out of thin air. [Shangguan Jing'er] dodged quickly, while the ghost-faced figure, incredibly eerie, regenerated in a matter of moments. As [Pei Donglai] flew past, he exclaimed in surprise.
0:54:52|0:54:54|Beside her, [Shangguan Jing'er] answered confidently.
0:54:54|0:55:13|[Di Renjie] took advantage of the chaos to circle behind the Ghost-Faced Man, kicking a wooden stake towards him. Unexpectedly, the Ghost-Faced Man seemed to have eyes on the back of his head, reaching back without looking to push the stake down. Failing in his initial plan, [Di Renjie] then single-handedly drew the attention of the Ghost-Faced Man, while [Shangguan Jing'er] used her whip to bind the Ghost-Faced Man to the stake.
0:55:13|0:55:38|Just when [Pei Donglai] thought that everyone had successfully bound him, the ghost-faced man on the wooden stake actually broke free from the restraints. He was seen trying to shed his skin again. Chaos ensued among the crowd as he held a snake-shaped short sword in his right hand and a dark command flag in his left hand, standing fearlessly among the three people.
0:55:38|0:55:55|[Di Renjie] assessed the situation and knew that this person was not easy to deal with. He was concerned about the safety of Wang Lu and did not want to entangle with him further. He signaled [Pei Donglai] to pretend to attack the mysterious Ghost Face Man. While they were entangled in combat, he hurriedly rushed to Wang Lu's side, pulling him out of the water and quickly said,
0:55:55|0:56:16|Di Renjie threw Wang Lu into the fallen wood on the side, and then Pei Donglai, who was hiding in the dark, immediately got up to protect Wang Lu. The ghost-faced man realized he had been tricked, became furious, and threw wooden stakes at Shangguan Jing'er one after another with great force and tricky angles. Shangguan Jing'er narrowly avoided them as she dodged, while Di Renjie came to assist and engaged in a fight with the ghost-faced man.
0:56:16|0:56:38|Just as he had just subdued its arms, the ghost-faced figure shed the restraints on its upper body again. However, this time the arms that retreated could not transform into human form, and they fell straight into the water. Two strange fish escaped from the wide sleeves of its robe, their eyes emitting a penetrating light through the water's surface. The strange fish swam to the shore, leaped out, and transformed into a different appearance. It appeared as strong as a human, with all four limbs intact.
0:56:38|0:56:57|With a head like a demon vulture, wielding a curved blade and feet like long nails, possessing a formidable killing power, it headed straight for the donkey on the shore. Just as [Pei Donglai] arrived, unable to get close to protect, he wielded his hand axe and easily split the monster in two with an unintentional move. Before he could relax, he saw the monster flying up out of nowhere, baring its fangs and claws.
0:56:57|0:57:14|[Pei Donglai] immediately drew his sword and with great force, struck down the monster's head. He then stepped on the body and, in the dim light, discovered that the monster was just a puppet controlled by thin threads. Looking up, he saw several assassins manipulating the monster with silk threads from the dark wall.
0:57:14|0:57:27|Pei Donglai was furious, as a high-ranking official of the Grand Court of the Tang Dynasty, he was being embarrassed by such a trick from the martial world. He took out a wooden stake and threw it with all his might, directly breaking all the clever silk threads, rendering the monster immobile.
0:57:28|0:57:45|Seeing [Shangguan Jing'er] in a tough battle, he turned to [Di Renjie] and said, after this battle, the three of them cooperated seamlessly, already letting go of past grievances and becoming companions to each other. Pei Donglai finished speaking, picked up the hand axe on the high platform, leaped down, forced the ghost-faced person back, and then fought side by side with Jing'er.
0:57:45|0:58:7|On the other side, after [Di Renjie] settled the donkey, he found numerous beams on the top of the building, messy and unstable. He came up with a plan and shouted loudly to the two struggling below. With that, he clapped his hands together and broke the beams of the shed. Countless wooden boards fell down, smashing the ghost-faced man underneath.
0:58:7|0:58:31|During this break, the four of them gathered together for a brief rest. After a tough battle, Pei Donglai was sweating profusely but managed to catch his breath. Looking at the donkey in front of him, Di Renjie had calmed down by now. Upon hearing Shangguan Jing'er's words, he pondered for a moment. Then, Pei Donglai lowered his voice and said, "..."
0:58:31|0:58:45|The ghost-faced man was unharmed, searching around, when Jing'er finished speaking, she found [Di Renjie] staring at her intently, feeling uncomfortable, she became angry, turned her head and broke through the wooden barrier in front of her.
0:59:3|0:59:10|[Di Renjie] rode his donkey towards the ground, preparing to leave the ghost market. Pei Donglai, feeling worried, could only silently follow behind him on the road.
0:59:11|0:59:24|On the other side, in the intricate underground caves, [Shangguan Jing'er] pursued the trail of the Ghost Face alone. In this unfathomable underground city, wherever she went was dark and quiet, with ravines and cliffs everywhere. A moment of carelessness could lead to being buried in the abyss.
0:59:24|0:59:38|While Di Renjie and his companions were on the road, Pei Donglai suddenly heard a strange laughter in the distance. Concern for Shangguan Jing'er rose in his heart once again. He stopped in his tracks, hesitated for a moment, then turned around to go help Shangguan Jing'er.
0:59:38|0:59:52|[Pei Donglai] returned to a vast underwater area along the original path, losing track of the two individuals. Fortunately, a long whistle was heard in the distance. He looked around and listened carefully, only to realize that the source of the sound was actually on the high cliff above.
0:59:52|1:0:17|[Pei Donglai] raised his head and carefully examined the numerous abandoned halls on the cliffs on both sides. The walls were carved with niches by human hands, with fires burning inside for illumination. Despite the countless dangers, there was still room for climbing. After a difficult journey, [Pei Donglai] climbed into a passage on the cliff. In its depths, he heard some movement and immediately became alert, taking three gold needles from his waist and holding them in his hand.
1:0:17|1:0:35|On the other side of the corridor, [Pei Donglai] suddenly sensed something amiss. He concealed himself behind the cave wall, gathered his energy in his lower abdomen, and prepared to strike. He then threw a hidden weapon to attract attention and ran after it. When they reached the corner, he threw his hand axe, and as the two met face to face, they realized each other's identities.
1:0:35|1:0:41|[Shangguan Jing'er] leaned against the wall, each holding their weapons. Pei Donglai asked anxiously,
1:0:42|1:1:6|Without waiting for him to finish speaking, [Shangguan Jing'er] stretched her hand in front of her. [Pei Donglai] knew that the ghost-faced person must be deep in the corridor, so he took off the hollow incense burner from his waist and threw it forward. The copper burner rolled on the ground in a spherical shape, with the fire stones and licorice rubbing against each other, creating sparks that illuminated the location of the ghost-faced person in a moment. [Pei Donglai] immediately flew after him, following the ghost-faced person through the grass and jumping out of the corridor.
1:1:6|1:1:15|Unexpectedly, outside the corridor was a cliff. The ghost-faced man disappeared without a trace, leaving [Pei Donglai] in a predicament. Caught off guard, he stepped into the air and fell off the cliff.
1:1:15|1:1:37|Fortunately, there were numerous trees at the bottom of the cliff. [Pei Donglai] regained consciousness, relied on his light skills, used tree branches as cushion, landed safely without any harm, then quickly stood up, alert to his surroundings. He found that the mysterious masked man had already disappeared. Upon closer inspection, he saw a bright light deep in the woods, and in front of him, a stone tablet with faintly engraved words.
1:1:37|1:1:43|[Pei Donglai] took out a fire starter, lit it, and carefully examined it. [Pei Donglai] muttered the words carved on the stone tablet in a low voice.
1:1:48|1:2:6|It turned out that this was the place where the current national teacher Lu Liching practiced cultivation. Why did [Pei Donglai] jump from the top of the Ghost Market and come to Wuji Temple? He couldn't figure it out. The next day, [Di Renjie] returned to Luoyang City with Wang Lu ahead of time. The two of them were on guard all the way to an unfinished foreign church outside the city.
1:2:28|1:2:37|Wang Lu was seen pulling out several silver needles from behind his head while speaking, causing his facial features to contort and his appearance to change drastically in an instant.
1:3:3|1:3:33|Upon hearing these words, [Di Renjie] was plunged into memories of a similar night at the Sifang Pavilion, where [Shangguan Jing'er] had also spoken similar words. Before they could delve into details, a knock on the door suddenly sounded. Calming the startled Wang Lu, [Di Renjie] got up to open the door, only to find [Pei Donglai] and [Shangguan Jing'er] outside. Having failed to find the culprit, the two returned together.
1:3:33|1:3:42|Stepping into the church, [Pei Donglai] was the first to notice the greatly changed appearance of Wang Lu, and asked in surprise,
1:4:21|1:4:31|[Shangguan Jing'er], with a strong personality, couldn't tolerate Wang Lu's disrespectful words. In an instant, she whipped Wang Lu and hung him up on a nearby scaffold. [Di Renjie] quickly stepped forward and grabbed a section of the whip.
1:4:46|1:4:52|This speech made [Shangguan Jing'er] lose her temper, and Wang Lu quickly spoke up,
1:6:34|1:6:52|The scene shifts to the imperial palace, where [Wu Zetian] overturns the chessboard in front of her and then stands up. Looking at [Shangguan Jing'er] who just delivered a message from [Di Renjie], she questions, the power of [Wu Zetian] is like rolling thunder in the clouds, unpredictable and inscrutable. [Shangguan Jing'er] kneels on the ground, trembling slightly, afraid to speak.
1:7:14|1:7:35|Upon hearing the words of [Wu Zetian], [Shangguan Jing'er] knew that she had made up her mind to eliminate [Di Renjie]. However, for some reason, she did not feel fearful for angering [Wu Zetian] at that moment. Instead, a hint of inexplicable sadness arose in her heart. The scene then shifted to the bustling market within the city.
1:8:10|1:8:24|The streets were bustling with activity. [Di Renjie] and [Pei Donglai] sat on their horses, deducing the case. However, looking through the dense crowd, they saw that at the street corner, Wang Li Xiao of Langya was waiting with a group for a long time. Unlike [Di Renjie], Pei Donglai had to dismount when he saw the prince.
1:8:30|1:8:37|Li Xiao sat on the horse, one hand on his waist, staring straight at [Di Renjie], and then heard him say solemnly,
1:8:40|1:8:44|As soon as the words fell, a servant handed over a long strip-like object with both hands.
1:8:46|1:9:0|[Di Renjie] watched as the servant pulled out the object and recognized it as the Dragon-Taming Staff bestowed by the late emperor. He quickly dismounted and knelt on the ground, hands raised above his head, ready to receive the staff. Li Xiao stepped forward, holding the staff, and spoke to [Di Renjie].
1:9:19|1:9:35|[Di Renjie] was overwhelmed with memories for a moment, but he did not lose his composure. He looked up at Li Xiao and said.
1:9:42|1:9:51|Upon hearing Di Renjie's words, Li Xiao continued speaking in a calm and unhurried manner.
1:10:13|1:10:27|At this moment, a fierce demonic wind suddenly swept through the city, with yellow sand filling the market and animals becoming restless. Only [Di Renjie] listened to Li Xiao's words attentively. Even after Li Xiao left, [Di Renjie], who heard the news, remained kneeling on the ground, unable to calm down.
1:11:8|1:11:15|As soon as the words fell, Li Xiao, who was showing off the gem on his forehead, was hit by an arrow from an unknown place, and fell silent on the chessboard.
1:11:19|1:11:24|Guests on the field panicked and fled in all directions, seeking refuge. At this moment, under the bright sun, Li Xiao and others were chatting on the terrace of the mansion.
1:11:26|1:11:48|Now Li Xia died from an arrow, exposed under the sunlight, and in just a moment, his body was shrouded in smoke, eventually burning to ashes. It is likely that the assassin who killed Wang Li Xia at Langya Pavilion is the same person responsible for the previous two burning cases. The scene shifts to the interior of Sifang Pavilion, where night has fallen, yet the pavilion is still brightly lit, with music and dance in full swing.
1:11:48|1:12:3|In the hall, light gauze hung around, swaying with the breeze. Inside the room, the guests were dressed in luxurious clothes, enjoying delicacies and fine wines. In the courtyard outside the hall, [Di Renjie] stood leaning against the wall, holding the Konglong Rod in his hand, gently stroking it, looking pensive.
1:12:3|1:12:12|The maidservant in the hall passed by with a lantern, the flickering light shining on [Di Renjie]'s face, casting changing shadows, until the courtyard returned to darkness. He said,
1:12:13|1:12:39|[Di Renjie] finished speaking and saw a figure walking up the steps from behind him. The person walked to the tree, picked a magnolia flower from a branch, and stopped in front of him to carefully examine. It turned out to be the current Empress of the Great Tang, [Wu Zetian]. She pushed aside the flower branches and stared at the Dragon-Taming Staff, then asked [Di Renjie].
1:12:57|1:13:15|With words matching actions, [Di Renjie] wielded the Konglong Rod and struck it against the stone lamp beside him. Cracks appeared where it landed, spreading gradually throughout the lamp. In a matter of moments, the lamp shattered into pieces, as if being peeled layer by layer, scattering debris all over the ground.
1:13:37|1:13:50|Upon hearing Di Renjie's question, Shangguan Jing'er, who was hiding in the shadows, gestured and signaled. The Imperial Guards drew their bows and arrows, ready to shoot. Empress Wu Zetian, however, remained calm and indifferent, only looking at Di Renjie, who held a staff in his hands, and spoke lightly.
1:14:8|1:14:15|[Di Renjie] has a keen sense of hearing. The unusual sound of a taut bowstring enters his ears, but he remains calm and observes quietly.
1:15:3|1:15:18|Upon seeing the Imperial Guards, [Pei Donglai] knew that the Empress was present. He indicated his purpose and then dismounted and walked towards the courtyard. As the Empress walked past [Pei Donglai] with her back to [Di Renjie], [Shangguan Jing'er] led a group of people from the shadows near the Empress, ready with bows and arrows in case of any trouble.
1:15:25|1:15:30|Upon hearing that King Li Xiao of Langya has died, the Empress, with a look of shock on her face,
1:15:36|1:15:46|During this pause, [Di Renjie] immediately withdrew, causing a commotion among the Imperial Guards. The Empress turned her head and saw that all the soldiers were searching for [Di Renjie], except for [Shangguan Jing'er].
1:15:46|1:15:55|Smiling and looking in the direction he fled, she did not say much. The Empress Dowager only dispatched [Pei Donglai] to rush to the mansion of the Minister of Works, Jia Yizhi, overnight.
1:16:11|1:16:20|Lady Jia led [Pei Donglai] to the study, where now only remnants of the past remained, with scorched wood and dust scattered around.
1:16:37|1:16:43|The butler and maid hurried to take care and comfort, but then [Pei Donglai] continued to speak up and ask,
1:17:14|1:17:34|Sensing that there was still potential to explore this clue, [Pei Donglai] couldn't wait to call on Jia Yi and the others to lead the way. So the group hurriedly arrived at Jia Yi's former office, [Pei Donglai] rushed in first, searching frantically on the low table in the room. All they found was emptiness, except for numerous scrolls and drawings of the four treasures of the study on the table.
1:17:34|1:17:44|[Pei Donglai] carefully examined the documents, and one drawing caught his attention. As he carefully reviewed the file, his expression turned unusually stern, as if he had discovered something extraordinary.
1:17:44|1:18:1|Clue. After collecting relevant physical evidence, [Pei Donglai] prepared to leave Jia Yi. He wrapped the scroll of drawings in a bundle, stuffed it into the side leather bag of the saddle, and carefully placed the most important clue he had found into his bosom. He looked around vigilantly before mounting his horse and riding away.
1:18:1|1:18:12|On the other side, focusing on solving the case, regardless of others, [Di Renjie] eventually took advantage of the night to sneak into the Wuji Temple to search for answers, throwing iron ropes, hooking onto the walls, and then [Di Renjie] flipped over and entered.
1:18:12|1:18:31|Approaching the main hall, one could see a bronze lotus-shaped cauldron on the sacrificial platform in front of the hall, with eight flagpoles raised high. Descending the steps, there stood a solemn statue of the zodiac animals, but the place was deserted and quiet. On the other side, [Pei Donglai] rode his horse through the streets and alleys, preparing to bring back the evidence to the Supreme Court.
1:18:31|1:18:43|While on the road, Di Renjie always felt someone following him. Every time he turned around, he saw nothing. Suddenly, the sound of galloping hooves behind him became more intense, and when he turned around again, he was shocked to see five riders chasing after him in the night.
1:18:43|1:18:54|[Pei Donglai], lost in thought, suddenly saw a carriage crossing the intersection ahead. He immediately pulled the reins to stop the horse, but before he could catch his breath, a night traveler rushed towards him, and the two engaged in a fierce battle.
1:18:54|1:19:8|[Pei Donglai] hurriedly fought back, while the opponent's martial arts were strong and fierce like a tiger descending a mountain, forcing him to draw his sword and drive the opponent back. With one sword strike, [Pei Donglai] lifted the black veil used by the night stalker to cover their face, revealing a dark exotic face, turned out to be a Kunlun slave.
1:19:8|1:19:16|Just as [Pei Donglai] was taken aback, the other night stalkers soared into the air and dropped a large iron net, trapping him securely and rendering him immobile.
1:19:17|1:19:32|Just as the Kunlun slave knocked [Pei Donglai] down with a sweeping leg kick, several toothed steel knives were placed at his neck. In the blink of an eye, [Pei Donglai] was captured alive. Meanwhile, inside the Wuji Pavilion, [Di Renjie] was still searching for the whereabouts of the National Teacher. Just when he was at a loss, a deer's cry was heard from inside the pavilion.
1:19:32|1:19:39|Soon after, a spotted deer appeared on the altar in front of the hall,
1:21:18|1:21:43|Hearing this, the national teacher on the bronze tripod transformed his appearance from a sturdy man to that of [Shangguan Jing'er] by pulling out several long needles from behind his head, resembling a donkey being startled. Looking at the national teacher's attire with a blood-red robe, holding a silver snake short sword in his right hand and a dark command flag in his left hand, he bore a striking resemblance to the ghost-faced man, so it's no wonder that [Pei Donglai] mistook him for the national teacher at that time.
1:21:43|1:21:49|Upon seeing the national master restored to his original appearance, [Di Renjie] looked at the face of [Shangguan Jing'er] and continued speaking.
1:22:34|1:22:45|[Di Renjie] finished speaking, only to see [Shangguan Jing'er] with bloodshot eyes, tears of anger streaming down her cheeks. She then raised her head and let out a long howl, followed by the appearance of tree branch wind chimes in the Wuji Temple.
1:22:48|1:22:56|On the bronze tripod, [Shangguan Jing'er] waved the command flag, heading straight towards [Di Renjie], as the several spirit deer seemed to follow her orders and charged straight down to the square below the platform.
1:22:56|1:23:9|[Di Renjie] dodged the attack of the first deer, then drew his Konglong Jiann from his waist and propped it on another deer's antler. Unexpectedly, this deer had immense strength. [Di Renjie] kept retreating until he bumped into two statues behind him and stopped.
1:23:9|1:23:21|Seeing the spiritual deer returning, he quickly dodged, causing the two deer to collide, leaving one paralyzed. He then sat on the beastman figurine, and as the spiritual deer approached, he swung the Dragon-Taming Mace, which was struck by the deer's antlers.
1:23:21|1:23:35|The spiritual deer fell in pain from mid-air, knocked over the censer and fainted on the ground. As the censer fell and rolled, smoke filled the air, and [Di Renjie] jumped down from the beastman statue, covering his nose and mouth, looking surprised.
1:23:36|1:23:41|As soon as the words fell, [Shangguan Jing'er] leaped off the bronze tripod and ran towards the back of the hall.
1:23:41|1:24:3|Di Renjie hurriedly rushed out of the smoke, mounted the altar and chased after her. Whether it was the effect of the bewitching incense or the brilliant spell cast by Shangguan Jing'er, Di Renjie suddenly felt a bit dizzy. The silk and satin in front of him seemed to come to life, and he recklessly rushed out, finding himself in a small courtyard with a Bagua diagram on the ground.
1:24:3|1:24:15|[Di Renjie] stepped forward, feeling as if the sky and earth were spinning around him. The entire courtyard seemed to be made up of countless long snakes coiled together, with no connection between them. Standing in the midst of it, he was entangled in a terrifying swarm of snakes, a sight too horrifying to bear.
1:24:15|1:24:31|Just as [Di Renjie] was feeling uneasy, [Shangguan Jing'er] suddenly attacked from behind with her spirit snake short sword, catching him off guard. [Di Renjie] reacted quickly, narrowly avoiding [Shangguan Jing'er]'s fatal strike. In this illusionary realm, her martial arts skills were enhanced by 80%, forcing her to defend and counterattack.
1:24:31|1:24:46|After the clash of lightning and fire, [Di Renjie] staggered with unsteady steps, his clothes soaked with cold sweat. Seeing that [Shangguan Jing'er] still couldn't harm him in the slightest, she decisively withdrew from the battlefield, and the two of them gazed at each other from a distance. Utilizing the power of the bewitching fragrance, [Shangguan Jing'er] once again cast illusions on him.
1:24:46|1:24:53|At the moment their eyes met, it was as if time and space had twisted. In just a brief moment, [Di Renjie] found himself lost in a fantasy.
1:24:53|1:25:6|The illusion was so powerful that [Di Renjie] found it hard to resist, feeling as if everything within his sight was just a dream. [Shangguan Jing'er] attacked alone with her short sword, but in his eyes, it seemed like there were hundreds of figures coming at him with force.
1:25:6|1:25:23|The ground beneath his feet once again fell into turmoil, leaving [Di Renjie] unable to protect himself, falling to the ground. Startled, [Di Renjie] quickly rolled over, struggling to stand up. Just as he was at his weakest, [Shangguan Jing'er] launched an attack towards him. However, in the eyes of [Di Renjie] under the spell, this action appeared as a different scene.
1:25:23|1:25:37|He felt a blood-colored silk shuttle through the fantasy world around him, incredibly powerful. He saw the silk continuously rolling and smashing towards the stone pillars in the courtyard, forcing [Di Renjie] to do his best to dodge the impact of those huge stones.
1:25:37|1:25:56|After this confrontation, [Di Renjie] was gasping for breath, finding it difficult to stand. He inserted his staff into the ground to support himself and calm down. He closed his eyes, trying to regulate his breathing. [Shangguan Jing'er] stood on top of a stone pillar, observing with her sword in hand. Although she didn't know what [Di Renjie] was doing, seeing him close his eyes, she felt it was a perfect opportunity granted by the heavens, and thus she swiftly descended.
1:25:56|1:26:11|At this moment, [Di Renjie] had completely calmed down, facing [Shangguan Jing'er] and her silver snake short sword. With a loud shout, the blade of the sword in [Shangguan Jing'er]'s hand broke off, hitting a stone pillar and bending back during their intense struggle.
1:26:12|1:26:27|[Di Renjie] felt a flash of sword light and knew the situation was critical. He pushed [Shangguan Jing'er] away, but couldn't dodge in time. The broken sword pierced his chest. [Shangguan Jing'er] was unaware of [Di Renjie]'s noble act and accidentally knocked him unconscious. It wasn't until she sat on him that she discovered the short sword in his chest.
1:26:38|1:26:53|Looking at the unconscious Di Renjie beneath her, Shangguan Jing'er couldn't help but recall the words the Empress had said to him in the palace. Her heart was in turmoil, tears welling up in her eyes. With a long howl, she fiercely stabbed downwards with the broken sword held in both hands.
1:26:53|1:27:10|This series of actions almost exhausted all her strength, but [Shangguan Jing'er]'s face gradually calmed down. Looking at the broken sword a few inches away from [Di Renjie], deeply embedded in the ground without any bloodstains, [Shangguan Jing'er] was ultimately not ruthless enough to follow the Empress's orders.
1:27:10|1:27:26|Early the next morning, [Shangguan Jing'er] quickly dealt with the arrow wound on [Di Renjie]'s chest. She then dragged him away from Wuji Temple and into the nearby mountains. Her makeup was already smudged, and she hid [Di Renjie] in the wilderness, remaining vigilant of any movement around them.
1:27:39|1:28:7|Unbeknownst to her, she triggered a trap set by someone, a bamboo pole pierced through her abdomen. [Shangguan Jing'er] went limp in the lower body and fell to the ground. Unexpectedly, she touched an almost invisible thread, causing the bamboo to pierce through her body again, splattering countless blood. [Shangguan Jing'er], twice wounded and unable to support herself, knelt on the ground. After an unknown period of time, a voice suddenly spoke in the tranquil mountain forest.
1:28:19|1:28:35|Soon after, a group of people quickly left the ambush area. Before long, they saw [Shangguan Jing'er] leading [Di Renjie] actually falling from the mist-covered treetops. Fortunately, they survived the ordeal, but [Shangguan Jing'er] was already seriously injured. After this incident, she fell into a coma and it was noon by the time [Di Renjie] regained consciousness.
1:28:35|1:28:55|[Shangguan Jing'er] weakly spoke, her face pale, and she shook her head slowly as if her breath was as delicate as a thread.
1:29:12|1:29:34|After she finished speaking, she gently placed her hand on [Di Renjie]'s neck. [Di Renjie] also understood and tenderly leaned towards her colored lips. Then, [Di Renjie] took [Shangguan Jing'er] back to the outside of the palace walls in Luoyang City, found a white horse, and placed [Shangguan Jing'er] on its back. He watched as [Shangguan Jing'er] cried uncontrollably, but could only pat the horse's body and send [Shangguan Jing'er] into the imperial city.
1:30:14|1:30:29|The scene in the palace suddenly descended into chaos. Surrounded by a group of eunuchs, the Empress lost her usual composure and hurriedly made her way to the Hall of Light. There, in front of the hall, lay a body covered in blood, none other than the once graceful and now extremely weak [Shangguan Jing'er].
1:30:40|1:30:45|The Empress held [Shangguan Jing'er] in her arms, and when she saw that she had something to say, she dismissed the attendants around her.
1:31:1|1:31:39|[Shangguan Jing'er] was reminded of certain past events by her words. She forced a smile and said, the Empress and [Shangguan Jing'er] had a heart-to-heart talk. Although she was an empress, her heart was not made of stone. At this moment, she was in great pain. The Empress was reluctant to answer, but she smiled and tidied up [Shangguan Jing'er]'s messy hair. However, the person in her arms asked straightforwardly and decisively.
1:31:39|1:31:45|Empress Wu Zetian firmly replied to this, and Shangguan Jing'er immediately collapsed, dying in the Empress's arms.
1:31:45|1:32:11|For [Shangguan Jing'er], who has long lived in the deep palace, the word "love" is something she vaguely understands. But without a doubt, she loves the Empress, born for the Empress and willing to die for her. Perhaps she also loves [Di Renjie]. When they met, the steel that had been tempered a hundred times had turned into a tender sentiment of parting. Perhaps for [Shangguan Jing'er], this is the best ending - not harming [Di Renjie] in the slightest, nor failing the Empress's trust.
1:32:12|1:32:35|At a time when the entire imperial city was overshadowed by the mourning of the Empress, on the other side, [Di Renjie] carefully sneaked into the Sifang Pavilion. He pushed aside the curtain and saw the horse ridden by [Pei Donglai] standing in the courtyard. After a moment of contemplation, [Di Renjie] believed that he should stay here on the Empress's orders. So he cautiously proceeded to the residence to prepare for a conversation with him, releasing his senses as he walked on the corridor bridge.
1:32:35|1:32:50|Today, the Sifang Pavilion was particularly quiet, and [Di Renjie] felt his nerves tighten. As he cautiously opened the door outside the residence, he saw a figure in a black robe, chained and lying on the terrace, as the room inside was empty.
1:32:50|1:32:58|A mechanism of ropes is set up on the door, connected to the door frame. When the door is opened to a certain width, the ropes suddenly pull and yank the wooden door.
1:33:4|1:33:15|It is [Pei Donglai]. Seeing him trapped on a wooden stake, facing the sun, [Di Renjie] immediately wielded the Konglongjian and rushed up. [Pei Donglai], who already disliked sunlight, now felt even more tormented by the exposure to the sun on the terrace. He began to speak.
1:33:21|1:33:31|While [Di Renjie] was about to dictate the clues, flames suddenly appeared on [Pei Donglai]'s body, and smoke billowed from his seven orifices, making it difficult to describe in words.
1:33:32|1:33:48|[Di Renjie] untied him and dragged him into the house, but it was too late. Then flames ignited on [Pei Donglai], causing unbearable pain. [Di Renjie] tried to drag him again, but the flames had already engulfed his whole body. He struggled to drag him, only managing to tear off a step of the stairs.
1:33:48|1:34:2|In the moment of contemplating redemption, [Pei Donglai] was surrounded by sparks, burning intensely, making it difficult to stand. [Di Renjie] could only watch him contort and eventually burn out. Despite enduring the pain of demonic fire consuming his body,
1:34:2|1:34:17|[Pei Donglai] did not shout wildly like an ordinary person. He just clenched his right fist, hoarsely muttered something, until he turned into a flying ash. [Di Renjie] was stunned. He could not imagine that the murderer would use such means to make him watch his companion die.
1:34:17|1:34:38|[Pei Donglai], who does not like the heat, has always wandered in the darkness. His actions are upright and pure, just like the solemn snow on his hair, reflecting the brightness in his heart. He is like a towering pine tree, with many branches and leaves, suitable to be the pillar of a great building. It is a pity that he has now been betrayed and lost to the flames, which is truly regrettable.
1:34:38|1:34:56|[Di Renjie] knelt before the ashes of his colleague in mourning, but suddenly remembered the words [Pei Donglai] muttered before his death. He opened his eyes and used his long staff to flip over the charred body parts on the ground. Among them, he found a slightly different sounding horse bridle buckle, realizing that [Pei Donglai] had important information to convey to him.
1:34:56|1:35:3|He then picked up the horse rein buckle, carefully examined it, and found no hidden information.
1:35:3|1:35:27|The scene shifts, [Di Renjie] walks into the courtyard and approaches the horse ridden by [Pei Donglai]. He holds the horse reins in his hand, comparing them with the horse's body, and notices a leather strap locking the reins, with only two out of three reins buckled. He realizes the secret lies here. He reaches under the horse but finds nothing, then discovers a stack of yellow paper under the saddle.
1:35:27|1:35:36|It was the crucial clue that [Pei Donglai] had hidden in his arms at the beginning. After being captured, it took him a great deal of effort to conceal the clue here.
1:35:36|1:35:51|[Di Renjie] couldn't wait to untie the yellow paper and upon examining it closely, his expression immediately changed. It seemed like all the difficult points of the case were suddenly clear to him from the clues on the paper, showing regret and anger on his face as the identity of the killer was about to be revealed.
1:35:51|1:36:17|The scene shifts to inside the imperial palace, where the Empress Dowager [Wu Zetian] has suppressed the grief of [Shangguan Jing'er]'s passing. After grooming herself, she dresses in fine silk and stands outside the hall, gazing at the towering pagoda that reaches sixty-six zhang high, exuding a majestic aura that seems to overlook the world and embody an indomitable spirit.
1:36:18|1:36:24|She seemed to be proclaiming to the world with such a look that women can also ascend to the throne and be honored as the supreme ruler.
1:36:25|1:36:34|Turning around and walking into the palace, Di Renjie saw several eunuchs standing or crouching, holding up the court robes to be worn by the Empress Dowager on the coronation day.
1:36:34|1:36:58|Upon the luxurious attire, the symbol of status, the nine-clawed golden dragon, was no longer visible. In its place was a soaring divine phoenix. The Empress was immersed in the joy of Datong, unaware that within the towering pagoda, a cold gaze had been fixed on her for a long time. Unexpectedly, this person was none other than the overseer of the Great Buddha, [Di Renjie]'s old friend, Sha Tuo.
1:36:58|1:37:18|At this moment, he stood within the eyes of the Buddha, carrying a scroll of architectural drawings on his back, looking down. The timidity he usually showed in the face of weakness was nowhere to be seen, replaced by a chilling coldness that went straight to the bone. Seeing Wu Zetian entering the hall, Di Renjie turned and walked to the edge of the pavilion, throwing the scroll on his back down.
1:37:18|1:37:24|At the same time, a group of people from the lower level of the Futo walked in aggressively, led by the Kunlun slave who captured [Pei Donglai].
1:37:26|1:37:43|With a command from [Di Renjie], these people rushed to various hidden places inside the giant Buddha, acting swiftly and methodically, looking as if they had been trained for a long time. They pushed the giant gears to open the furnace under the central pillar, filled it with wood, and soon a roaring fire was lit.
1:37:43|1:38:7|As everything seemed to be going smoothly, a strong wind suddenly rose. [Di Renjie] heard the sound of paper fluttering beside him, and looking up, he saw a drawing posted on the wooden box in front of him. Understanding everything, [Di Renjie] then appeared and spoke slowly.
1:38:16|1:38:26|But the calamity of being framed for murder was hard to escape. [Di Renjie] neither argued nor interrupted the [Tujue] man's reasoning. He just stared at him, rolling up his sleeve to reveal the bronze hook on his severed hand.
1:38:37|1:38:52|[Di Renjie] saw [Shatuo] swing his arm, hitting directly on the miniature pagoda model. The greatly reduced Buddha statue, under his forceful blow, crashed straight towards the hall in the sand table. Seeing the hall collapse in an instant, [Di Renjie] tensed up and said.
1:39:22|1:39:30|[Sha Tuo] lifted the pedestal, and the two people in the wooden box slowly descended to the lower level.
1:40:4|1:40:14|[Shatuo] closed his eyes, seemingly recalling his various strategies through the words of [Di Renjie].
1:40:26|1:40:53|[Di Renjie] heard him say such words, knowing that this person had already lost his mind. [Shatuo] revealed his severed hand and calmly said, reaching out to puncture the top deck of the wooden box, immediately leaping out into the air and grabbing onto a hemp rope on the side. Inside the wooden box, [Di Renjie] looked up and saw the broken spot, from which countless red-flamed golden turtles poured down.
1:40:53|1:41:1|[Di Renjie] quickly rolled to dodge, leaping out of the wooden box and hanging in mid-air. [Shatuo] kicked fiercely on the hemp rope, closing in on [Di Renjie] with arms spread wide.
1:41:1|1:41:22|In desperation, [Di Renjie] had to move around and eventually used his hands to cling desperately to the copper ring. Looking up, he saw the spring tainted with the red flame golden turtle flowing gently through the cracks in the wooden planks. At the bottom of the box, numerous poisonous insects were crawling, occasionally falling from beside [Di Renjie], creating a series of dangerous situations.
1:41:22|1:41:42|[Shatuo] was constrained by the length of the hemp rope and could no longer act against [Di Renjie] under the wooden box. He flew away, while on the other side, countless red-flamed golden turtles had already fallen on [Di Renjie], who was hanging under the box. It was only with the faint moonlight that he noticed the golden turtles were draped in red clouds, with a hundred pairs of antennae that were truly terrifying.
1:41:42|1:41:59|After slapping the poisonous insect falling on his face to death, [Di Renjie] quickly dodged the poisonous arrows shot by the underlings of the Sand Tuo at the lower level of the giant Buddha. As the Sand Tuo landed along the hemp rope and arrived in front of his subordinates, he drew the long sword from his waist and hurriedly rushed to the hangar controlling the up and down movement of the wooden box.
1:41:59|1:42:16|[Shatuo] decisively swung his sword, cutting the rope connecting the wooden box without hesitation. [Di Renjie], who was hanging in mid-air, was suddenly pushed by the wooden box and rapidly descended towards the ground. In a critical moment, [Di Renjie] exerted all his strength to cling to the side of the wooden box and aimed for the floating bridge connected to the central pillar beside him.
1:42:23|1:42:31|At this moment, a loud noise was heard as the wooden box fell from a great height and crashed to the ground, indicating the immense height from which it had just fallen.
1:42:31|1:42:42|If [Di Renjie] had not taken the risk to leap out, solely relying on the human body, it would definitely not withstand such impact. Just as [Di Renjie] landed safely, two sections of pipes slowly descended, directly entering the core pillar.
1:42:48|1:42:58|[Di Renjie] silently thought in his heart, then looked around to observe the movements of the people, and knew that the Tujue tribe intended to use the high temperature of the lava to melt the central pillar, causing the collapse of the giant Buddha. Just as he was about to find a way to stop it,
1:42:58|1:43:15|Upon hearing the Kunlun slave's long roar and approaching towards himself, crucial to the ascension ceremony, [Di Renjie] was unwilling to engage with him and confront the enemy. He then swiftly moved towards the conduit and engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy who was pouring in molten lava. Seeing this, the Sand Troopers were afraid of any delay in their plan, so they quickly flew up to obstruct.
1:43:15|1:43:34|At that time, the two sides were entangled, reluctant to part. [Di Renjie], known as the detective who can solve any mystery, was also skilled in martial arts. With the bestowed Konglong Baton from the late emperor in hand, he displayed great prowess by placing the baton on the pipe, showing a formidable stance that seemed like one man guarding the pass against ten thousand.
1:43:55|1:44:14|The Sand Tribe harbored deep resentment and had already gone mad. Despite [Di Renjie]'s dissuasion, they couldn't contain their emotions. They roared and wielded their sword to clash with the Dragon Mace, forcing [Di Renjie] to retreat. The Sand Tribe then ordered their men to release molten lava, while they themselves, along with the Kunlun slaves, blocked the way. The situation was now set, as the molten lava poured into the central pillar and burned it down.
1:44:54|1:45:19|Kunlun slave heard this, charged forward, heading straight for [Di Renjie]. In the prosperous era of the Great Tang Dynasty, with envoys from all nations, the barbarian tribes and countless subjects, the so-called Kunlun slave was a barbarian captured from beyond the South Sea. These people were as strong as bulls, loyal to the core, and were slaves in wealthy households. However, even with his unparalleled martial arts, [Di Renjie] defeated them all with the sharpness of the Kangling staff, shattering the Kunlun slave's cheekbones.
1:45:19|1:45:33|Fingers intertwined, the pain of bone splitting, one can imagine, as another general under the command of the Tujue is lost, just when all seems helpless, a ray of morning sun shines through the dome of the giant Buddha. This battle has unknowingly raged on throughout the night.
1:45:33|1:45:47|The Tujue tribe was in a hurry, with the coronation of the Empress Dowager just around the corner, but they still couldn't deal with Di Renjie. Then, a plan came to mind, and they pushed open the windows of the grand pagoda, allowing sunlight to stream in.
1:45:47|1:46:9|[Di Renjie] saw him in such a state, hurriedly checked for wounds all over his body, and indeed found traces of bites from poisonous insects on his arm. At this critical moment, [Di Renjie] did not hesitate to show mercy, wielding the Konglong Mace skillfully to exploit the enemy's weaknesses, every move deadly. In an instant, the followers of the Sand Tribe were left dead in a pile. Amidst the chaos, he passed by a window without even realizing it.
1:46:9|1:46:21|[Di Renjie] suddenly felt dizzy, the heat unbearable. Looking down, he saw the bite marks from the venomous insect had turned black. [Di Renjie] couldn't believe it, and once again reached out his hand towards the rising sun.
1:46:27|1:46:34|At the same time, the enthronement ceremony in the Imperial Palace's Hall of Supreme Harmony has begun.
1:47:3|1:47:27|Di Renjie paid no attention to the shouting of the Shatuo, but stood on the pavilion carefully examining the two channels flowing with molten lava. He saw the molten lava flowing into the central pillar from the southwest and southeast directions, controlling its direction of fracture. After confirming the direction and formulating a feasible plan, he turned the Dragon Spine Mace, cutting through one of the iron chains. Then he shouted at the Shatuo.
1:47:30|1:47:40|With a final strike, the floating bridge collapsed and fell, crashing into a pipe on the side, scattering molten iron scraps all over the ground, sparking flames in all directions.
1:47:41|1:47:49|The Tujue people saw [Di Renjie] in this act, their faces filled with resentment, wishing to tear him apart, without caring about their former camaraderie.
1:47:50|1:47:56|[Di Renjie] stood on the pavilion after moving away from the molten lava pit,
1:48:6|1:48:18|The anger burned in his heart, the veins on his face bulged, roaring to vent, then he stabbed the water tank, took out the poisonous insect, poured it into the golden pot, sealed the mouth of the pot, and said.
1:48:19|1:48:46|He leaped onto a horse and continued to shout, then turned the horse's head and rode out of the Tongtian Pagoda. [Di Renjie] immediately mounted a steed and chased after him, as the sand bandits on horseback approached, shouting and pushing open the bronze gate.
1:48:49|1:49:5|The central pillar, eroded by lava for a long time, finally couldn't bear the weight and cracked in numerous places, causing the entire giant Buddha to shake violently. [Di Renjie] rode out of the tower, only to suddenly remember the gold turtle poison in his body, looking up to see a dark cloud overhead.
1:49:5|1:49:12|Feeling slightly relieved, Di Renjie immediately spurred his horse towards Shatuo. The two met on the battlefield in the city, one in front and one behind.
1:49:15|1:49:45|[Di Renjie] kept an eye on the situation while approaching Sha Tuo. Still haunted by the past, he shouted out loud. Sha Tuo's heart had been consumed by vengeance for nearly a decade, leaving only anger and the desire for revenge. The two tangled on the back of a horse, with Sha Tuo eager to finish the fight quickly and not let it delay any longer. He pushed [Di Renjie] back with all his might and did not pursue further.
1:49:45|1:50:4|Turning around and straddling the horse, he continued to gallop towards the Hall of Light. At the same time, the molten lava exploded at the foundation, causing the central pillar to collapse, slowly falling down. The floating bridge inside the pagoda broke like a thread, falling to the ground. The robe outside the pagoda cracked inch by inch, the giant Buddha tilted, approaching the Hall of Light.
1:50:4|1:50:17|In the palace and the government office, the guards looked as confused and lost as described by the Sha Tuo. On the other side, Sha Tuo paid no attention and continued to rush towards the Hall of Light at full speed. Wherever he passed, the sun shone brightly, leaving [Di Renjie] behind in a panic.
1:50:17|1:50:38|Despite the danger, [Di Renjie] was unwilling to give up the pursuit and had to hide under the horse's belly to avoid the sunlight. The guards in the Ming Hall hurriedly reported the news, causing panic among the officials, courtiers, and palace maids.
1:50:38|1:50:46|Only the newly crowned Empress [Wu Zetian] slowly stood up, her face unchanged, as the towering pagoda collapsed, causing the entire palace to shake.
1:50:46|1:51:0|[Wu Zetian]'s crown was adorned with hanging pearl curtains that kept clashing and swaying. Looking again, the grand Buddha statue appeared to have cracked, with the lotus flowers at its feet withered and almost gone, losing its former grandeur and majesty, causing chaos in the hearts of the people in the capital.
1:51:0|1:51:16|On the other side, [Di Renjie], who had been hiding under the horse's belly, finally waited for the moment when the sun was covered by clouds. He then climbed onto the horse of the Tujue. Just as he was about to reach the steps, [Di Renjie] attacked from behind the horse, catching the opponent off guard, and grabbed him by the chest, pulling him in front of himself with all his strength.
1:51:17|1:51:43|Reaching out to open the pot carried by the Sogdian, a swarm of poisonous insects poured out. [Di Renjie], who was already poisoned by the Golden Turtle, had no fear. In the chaos, the Sogdian was kicked out of the horse herd by [Di Renjie] at the right moment. Just as he was preparing to fight to the death, he lowered his head and saw thick black smoke emanating from his body. He quickly pulled open his chest and saw several fiery golden turtles clinging to him. Under the sunlight, a haze of smoke filled the air.
1:51:43|1:51:47|In just a moment, flames erupted on [Di Renjie]'s body,
1:51:54|1:52:3|Before his death, [Di Renjie] looked at the Mingtang, spitting out blood and roaring, through the eerie flames, it seemed that one could still see his crazed eyes.
1:52:11|1:52:18|Upon seeing the grand statue of herself as the emperor collapse on the day of her coronation, what thoughts ran through [Wu Zetian]'s mind?
1:52:24|1:52:44|Seeing the giant Buddha leaning towards the Hall of Light, the guards hurriedly supported [Wu Zetian] to dodge to the side. As the Buddha arrived, smoke filled the air and poured down, causing the entire Eastern Capital to tremble. When the Buddha landed, its head was knocked off and fell apart, revealing a huge Buddha face in the sky that enveloped the entire Hall of Light.
1:52:50|1:52:57|The guards protecting [Wu Zetian] were already extremely nervous. Upon hearing the voice and seeing the smoke filling the air without seeing anyone, they drew their swords in response.
1:52:57|1:53:12|[Di Renjie] at this moment couldn't spare the time to explain, and had to draw out the Konglong Staff to force the attendant back to the side, while taking [Wu Zetian] to dodge the Buddha's face in the sky. This move was truly a last resort, after all, [Di Renjie] still had the poison of the Golden Turtle inside him. If spontaneous combustion occurred next to [Wu Zetian], wouldn't it be a wasted effort.
1:53:12|1:53:32|Fortunately, at this moment, with dust flying in the air and obscuring the sun, the Buddha's face once again blocked the arrogant sun in mid-air, so [Di Renjie] was temporarily safe. With the giant Buddha completely fallen to the ground, the imperial city was shrouded in smoke, no longer showing the grandeur of the royal family. Before the Hall of Enlightenment, courtiers and guards emerged from the ruins and shouted.
1:53:37|1:53:50|[Di Renjie] guarded [Wu Zetian] with his own body, at this moment he was already in a daze. [Wu Zetian] lay weakly on the nearby broken stones.
1:53:53|1:54:0|The emperor's guards swept in, only to find [Wu Zetian] unharmed.
1:54:34|1:54:39|Di Renjie saw Wu Zetian deploying troops in the ruins, calm and composed. He nodded slightly and chuckled, saying a few words.
1:55:10|1:55:18|Empress Wu, in anger, stood up and threw off her phoenix robe, shouting to drive away countless courtiers like receding tide.
1:55:25|1:55:31|[Wu Zetian] knelt before the Konglong Scepter as summoned,
1:55:50|1:55:58|In tears, [Wu Zetian] spoke with eyes glistening like pearls, saying,
1:56:7|1:56:18|[Di Renjie] held up the Konglong Rod with both hands, knelt down in front of the Empress, quickly helped her up, and the Empress spoke,
1:56:27|1:56:35|[Di Renjie] smiled and then continued speaking,
1:56:41|1:56:55|He placed the Dragon-Taming Staff in the Empress's hand and then left. The Empress looked at his back, feeling a complex mix of emotions, but refrained from showing it in front of the court officials. And so, she let it go.
1:56:55|1:57:15|Gazing into the distance as [Di Renjie] departs, the scene shifts to a dark valley. Standing on a bridge by the shore, a figure with folded arms gazes into the distance where the river ends. Surrounding cliffs are dotted with ruins and countless scattered braziers, marking the ancient capital of Luoyang buried deep underground.
1:57:15|1:57:22|In the boundless ghost market, Di Renjie was still unaware of the identity of the person on the shore. Then another person approached, speaking slowly, "The truth will eventually come to light."
