0:0:54|0:1:15|On the calm river surface, a young boy is happily fishing in a wooden boat. Gunshots are heard from the direction of the Japanese invaders' watchtower on the other side of the river, as they are hunting down the Eighth Route Army. Bullets are falling sporadically, and an Eighth Route soldier falls into the river. The boy is terrified and quickly dives into the water.
0:1:22|0:1:48|In the midst of intense gunfire, a hand suddenly grabbed onto the wooden boat, it was Zhang Ga who had fallen into the river. He looked around and then pushed himself up onto the boat. Just as he had paddled a few times, a bullet unfortunately hit his left arm, causing him to stagger and fall onto the boat.
0:1:51|0:2:19|The wooden boat drifted slowly into the distance, while on the shore, the enemy's search continued. At this moment, as the sky darkened, the enemy shone flashlights onto the water, trying to find the trace of the Eighth Route Army. The wooden boat drifted aimlessly, floating into a patch of reeds, surrounded by silence.
0:2:22|0:2:41|The boat was moving slowly, leaving only layers of ripples, and soon entered deep into the reeds. At this moment, someone suddenly emerged from under the water.
0:2:42|0:3:1|It was the young man who had just caught fish. He lay on the side of the boat, looked at the fallen Eighth Route Army soldiers on the boat, and then dived into the water. He is the protagonist of our story today, [Zhang Ga]. [Zhang Ga]'s story takes place in 1943, the most brutal days of the War of Resistance against Japan.
0:3:1|0:3:10|The deputy company commander of the Eighth Route Army was injured during a mission and was brought back home by the fisherman [Zhang Ga]. And our story begins here.
0:3:14|0:3:30|At night, at Zhang Ga's home, the health worker is rechecking Luo Jinbao's injuries. Grandma is beside them, holding a candle and frowning with worry. But when she looks at Luo Jinbao, a kind smile appears on her face. The young health worker says excitedly.
0:3:40|0:3:43|[Luo Jinbao] smiled. Grandma pretended to be strange. After Grandma finished speaking, she stood up and placed the bamboo tray on the table.
0:4:21|0:4:26|The medic handed the medicine to [Luo Jinbao].
0:4:49|0:4:51|[Luo Jinbao] took out an old tobacco pipe as he spoke.
0:4:57|0:5:3|The medic struck a match as he lit the pipe for [Zhang Ga], and said, "..."
0:5:8|0:5:19|It's Zhang Ga who's back. Zhang Ga is seen shirtless, covered in mud, holding a fish in his hand. Zhang Ga proudly lifts up the big fish.
0:5:43|0:5:45|[Zhang Ga] rushed down to the side of [Sergeant Zhong].
0:6:2|0:6:18|[Zhang Ga] jumped off the kang, scooped up a basin of water, and buried his entire face in it, shaking his head in the water.
0:6:23|0:6:44|The scene shifts, at the entrance of the village under the big banyan tree, [Village Chief] Chungen is passing by. Suddenly, [Chungen] notices a person hiding in the tree, [Zhang Ga] jumps down from the tree. [Chungen] looks around cautiously.
0:6:50|0:6:55|[Zhang Ga] was about to leave when [Chun Gang] handed him a bag of rice. [Zhang Ga] smiled, turned around, and ran back home.
0:7:15|0:7:31|Grandma is making pancakes at home, [Zhang Ga] comes back from outside, the cat is at the door, sniffing the aroma of the pancakes, knocking and walking into the house, reaching out to steal one from the basket.
0:7:47|0:8:3|Grandma nodded. She took the rice and placed it on the stove, then walked to the table and wrapped the scrambled eggs in the pancake basket together. [Zhang Ga] conveniently placed the chopsticks inside. [Zhang Ga] then thought about stealing a bite.
0:8:13|0:8:39|[Zhang Ga] lifted the curtain on the kang, revealing a hidden door behind the flowers. [Zhang Ga] swiftly crawled out through the small door. The grandmother propped up the curtain while cautiously looking around. She closed the door, lowered the curtain, and covered the hidden entrance.
0:8:40|0:9:4|Behind the house, [Zhang Ga] crept through the path formed by the grass and the wall. He arrived in a yard overgrown with weeds. This yard had been uninhabited for over ten years, with the windows all blocked up with bricks. Inside the house, [Luo Jinbao] was making a wooden gun under the few rays of sunlight filtering in.
0:9:7|0:9:34|[Minister Lao] eagerly moved the pillar blocking the door, opened it, and let [Zhang Ga] crawl in from the hole in the brick wall outside the door. Mischievously wanting to scare [Minister Lao], after bringing [Zhang Ga] in, [Minister Lao] quickly closed the door and propped it up with the pillar.
0:10:7|0:10:29|[Zhang Ga] is extremely happy. [Zhang Ga] is acting out the scene of fighting the Japanese invaders with a wooden gun. [Zhang Ga] is pointing the wooden gun at the back of the Chinese platoon leader.
0:11:13|0:11:32|Once, when he went to Baoding Prefecture to gather intelligence and was returning, he had just stepped onto the road when he encountered two traitors. Two bayonets were pointed at his chest. At this moment, [Luo Jinbao] remained calm, with a slight smile on his face.
0:11:43|0:11:49|He slowly raised his hands, and the two traitors leaned forward, about to touch his waist.
0:11:59|0:12:31|Outside, gunshots were heard, indicating that the Japanese soldiers had entered the village. [Zhang Ga] immediately hugged [Luo Jinbao], who was about to lead [Zhang Ga] to escape. However, two collaborators appeared outside and noticed a hole in the brick wall. One of them approached, reached in with a gun, and tried to push open the door inside the hole, but failed.
0:12:31|0:12:47|In the room, [Lao Zhongshu] handed the sickle to [Zhang Ga] and held a wooden stick himself, guarding behind the door. The imposter dare not enter rashly, and came to the window blocked by bricks, considering breaking into the window.
0:13:0|0:13:12|One of them was stepping on the other, the one below was reluctant and wobbling, while the one above was cursing and poking wildly towards the window.
0:13:17|0:13:39|The falling chunks of earth from the window hit Captain Zhong and [Zhang Ga] directly in the face. [Zhang Ga] couldn't bear it at first, but seeing Captain Zhong unaffected, [Zhang Ga] also became brave. The heroic soldier poking the window from above vigorously clung to the window seam, staring inside with widened eyes.
0:14:6|0:14:10|While two pseudo-soldiers went to seek reinforcements, Lao Zhongshu quickly led [Zhang Ga] to move.
0:14:18|0:14:25|They walked along the path by the wall and the wall base towards [Zhang Ga]'s house, but heard the voice of the impostor inside the house.
0:14:35|0:14:54|Frustrated, the two could only return to the backyard. Seeing no one around, [Zhang Ga] and Lao Zhong climbed out of the wall in the backyard. They hid behind a mud wall.
0:15:3|0:15:25|The platoon leader Zhang Ga squeezed out of the door opening, then cautiously felt his way forward along the wall, constantly looking around. Just as he had passed through an alley, he unexpectedly encountered a group of puppet troops who were about to take away the villagers.
0:15:36|0:15:58|He immediately turned around, only to bump into enemies coming from another direction. Pang Dun saw Lao Zhongshu being taken away, he became anxious and ran to the rooftop.
0:16:31|0:16:38|[Zhang Ga] looked at the dilapidated house with great sadness, but he did not see his grandmother's figure, which made him extremely anxious.
0:16:46|0:17:8|[Zhang Ga] ran out crying and shouting, then the scene switched to his grandmother. The camera panned across the square, filled with people from the whole village. In front were a group of Japanese soldiers and collaborators, including the officer [Luo Jinbao] and his chubby translator.
0:17:8|0:17:12|They pressed Grandma in front of the whole village, forcing her to reveal the whereabouts of the Eighth Route Army.
0:17:16|0:17:33|The pole also arrived, she squeezed in from the back of the crowd, constantly looking around anxiously, searching for [Grandma], but she couldn't see her no matter how hard she tried. She squeezed past one after another.
0:17:34|0:17:48|Suddenly, a strong hand grabbed Zhang Ga's arm. He looked up and saw it was Uncle Luo Jinbao. Following Luo Jinbao's gaze, he saw Grandma standing in front of everyone.
0:17:48|0:17:55|The Japanese officer, [Gui Tian], with a cigarette in his mouth and a cloth in his hand, slowly walked up to [Grandma].
0:18:6|0:18:31|[Grandma] turned her head slowly, gave her a cold look, then turned away and ignored her. Helpless, [Gui Tian] ran to the other side of [Grandma] and threatened her. [Grandma] remained unmoved. Without any response from [Grandma], [Gui Tian] had no choice but to call for [Pang Dun].
0:19:5|0:19:27|Gui Tian, feeling pressured, drove away the pseudo army officer and stepped forward to speak. However, Grandma still gazed firmly ahead, making the Japanese soldiers furious.
0:19:37|0:20:7|Grandma lowered her head slightly, glanced at the bayonet on her neck, and sneered, showing no fear. The pseudo-soldiers beside her poked [Zhang Ga] Grandma with the gun barrels. [Zhang Ga] Grandma closed her eyes in pain, but still didn't utter a word.
0:20:12|0:20:37|The Japanese soldiers went crazy, pulling out their swords and slashing towards the grandmother. A voice came from behind, everyone turned around, only to see Captain Zhang Ga walking out from the crowd. Some villagers wanted to stop him, but Captain Zhang Ga shook his head with a smile, then walked towards the Japanese soldiers. The villagers started to worry.
0:20:41|0:20:59|Captain Zhong walked up to the Japanese soldier, causing Zhang Ga, Uncle Pure Steel, Grandma, and other villagers to become anxious. Gui Tian walked towards Captain Zhong in astonishment. Grandma tried to stop him, but was blocked by a bayonet.
0:21:10|0:21:51|Gui Tian was injured by a knife. He raised his thumb in approval, and Lao Zhong smiled and gestured for him to come closer. Gui Tian happily approached, but as soon as he got close, the platoon leader raised his hand and punched him, causing Gui Tian to fall to the ground in anger, ready to draw his sword. The platoon leader glanced at him disdainfully.
0:21:51|0:22:0|The Japanese had no choice but to arrest him first.
0:22:5|0:22:28|In a fit of anger, the Japanese soldier turned and fired a shot at the grandmother. As [Zhang Ga] cried out, the grandmother's body slowly fell to the ground. Under pressure from the Japanese, the Eighth Route Army was forced to move elsewhere.
0:22:29|0:22:37|And here, [Zhang Ga], with the help of Uncle Chungang, took care of Grandma's affairs and was about to set off to find the team.
0:23:19|0:23:28|Taking the shoes and dry food handed over by Zhang Ga, Luo Jinbao set off alone on a journey to find the Eighth Route Army.
0:23:54|0:24:0|Ka Zi arrived at a riverbank, walking barefoot along the river.
0:24:5|0:24:25|The river was wide, and [Zhang Ga] carried the bundle on his head as he swam across. As soon as he reached the shore, he encountered a group of Japanese soldiers. [Zhang Ga] quickly took off his straw hat and hid in a small ditch by the road.
0:24:26|0:24:42|He looked at the little devils with eyes full of anger, but there were too many devils, and the deep hatred could not be avenged. [Zhang Ga] remembered breaking a wild grass nearby, and pulled out the pistol tucked in his belt.
0:24:42|0:24:56|Unfortunately, it was just a wooden Ga Da. [Zhang Ga] could only tuck it into his arms again, glanced at his worn-out straw shoes, and decided to throw it away in frustration, walking barefoot.
0:24:59|0:25:28|The camera cuts to [Zhang Ga] entering the town and drinking water by a well. At that moment, a middle-aged man rides a bicycle past. [Zhang Ga] turns his head and sees the man dressed like a traitor, leaving his bicycle at the entrance before entering a courtyard alone.
0:25:29|0:25:54|With a smirk on his face, [Zhang Ga] started to scheme again. He quietly hid behind the stone wall, seeing no one around, and casually broke off a small branch.
0:26:12|0:26:28|Zhang Ga punctured the tire. Luo Jinbao quickly hid the stick. After a while, the man came out, got on the bike, but just a few steps later, he found the tire was flat.
0:26:29|0:26:59|[Zhang Ga], hiding on the side, saw his plan working and couldn't help but smile quietly. The man pushed the car to a big tree, took out the air pump, and bent down to inflate the tire. However, he didn't notice the little Ga who was following behind him.
0:27:30|0:27:53|Unexpectedly, the man turned around and directly knocked the pole to the ground. He was wearing sunglasses and holding a gun. Taking off the sunglasses, he saw the pole and was stunned. He walked over, picked up the wooden gun on the ground, and circled around the knocked-over pole.
0:28:4|0:28:10|[Zhang Ga] reluctantly stood up and patted his butt. [Zhang Ga] turned his head away, unwilling to say more to him.
0:28:34|0:28:54|[Zhang Ga] suddenly refused to answer, turned around and walked away. [Zhang Ga] couldn't leave, reluctantly squatted on the ground. The person walked over, pushed the cart, and stood in front of [Zhang Ga].
0:29:4|0:29:11|The man arrived at a house with a pole, and before he reached the door, someone came out to greet him.
0:29:33|0:29:59|The man entered the courtyard with a pole, becoming alert. He looked around and, after making sure no one was there, he pulled the pole and walked down a small path. He moved aside a pile of grass, then felt his way forward and pushed open a trap door.
0:30:4|0:30:27|He took two more steps forward, turned a corner, and then climbed over a row of rooftops. Finally, the man with the pole arrived at an inconspicuous small door. A person was standing guard at the door, holding a gun in his hand.
0:30:47|0:31:6|The man finished speaking and left. [Zhang Ga] looked around the room, where some were cutting hair for others, some were wiping gun barrels, some were practicing aiming, some were smoking pipes and tapping out rhythms, and some were sewing clothes, all dressed in military uniforms.
0:31:9|0:31:18|A person is wiping a machine gun. When [Zhang Ga] sees it, he is very happy and can't help but go forward to touch it.
0:31:40|0:31:44|The man who brought in [Zhang Ga] earlier shouted,
0:31:44|0:32:14|[Zhang Ga] followed him into the room and saw an older man sitting inside. The man glanced at [Zhang Ga], smiled slightly, put down what he was holding, picked up a Buddha statue, fanned himself while avoiding [Zhang Ga]'s gaze, then pretended to walk away. Suddenly, he shouted, "Zhang Ga!"
0:32:40|0:32:58|[Zhang Ga] excitedly threw himself into [Luo Jinbao]'s arms, finally finding a family member. The sadness in [Zhang Ga]'s heart could no longer be hidden. Seeing [Zhang Ga] crying loudly, the older man tenderly pulled him to sit down beside a stool.
0:33:19|0:33:32|[Luo Jinbao] and the team leader, upon meeting, both had a look of deep concern in their eyes for [Zhang Ga]. The team leader introduced [Zhang Ga] to the other comrades in the team.
0:33:38|0:33:41|[Zhang Ga] stood up with a clapperboard in hand, and everyone was drinking clapperboard wine.
0:35:35|0:35:43|Seeing [Zhang Ga] wearing loose clothes with an open heart, the health worker put Xiao Hao's clothes on [Zhang Ga].
0:36:44|0:36:57|Everyone packed up their things and the team began to move. Along the way, they marched forward in a neat line.
0:37:30|0:37:54|After trekking by land and water, and even passing by the enemy's watchtower, [Zhang Ga] followed the district captain and [Luo Jinbao] quietly slipped through from under the enemy's nose. They passed through the cornfield. Sometimes, [Luo Jinbao] would ride a bicycle with [Zhang Ga] sitting at the back.
0:37:59|0:38:23|He had a small twig in his mouth, with a sweet smile on his face. That day, [Zhang Ga] followed Old Luo on a mission. They set up a stall not far from the Japanese artillery tower, selling watermelons.
0:38:23|0:38:47|The scorching heat was unbearable, and [Pang Dun] came out alone, licking his belly. Seeing him walking towards [Zhang Ga], [Luo Jinbao] poked [Zhang Ga] with a fan. [Pang Dun] then squatted directly in front of the stall, patting this and knocking on that.
0:39:25|0:39:31|[Pang Dun] was rude and arrogant, [Zhang Ga] couldn't stand it and wanted to teach him a lesson, but was stopped by old Uncle [Luo Jinbao].
0:40:3|0:40:23|[Zhang Ga] was hit by a watermelon. [Zhang Ga] happily returned to the village with the confiscated gun and told the children about it.
0:41:8|0:41:14|That guy really followed orders and obediently raised both heads.
0:41:43|0:41:54|Saying that, [Zhang Ga], imitating the appearance of an adult, also tied a white towel on his head, and stood solemnly on the high platform, imitating a leader giving a speech.
0:43:29|0:43:45|The scene shifts to inside the house, where Mr. Zhang Ga is truly a hero among men. Despite the efforts of the Yellow Army, no, the little devils always end up losing money. No matter how they torture and interrogate, he always maintains a cold smile and a few words, truly admirable.
0:44:10|0:44:22|[Pang Dun] met [Zhang Ga] who was grinning without saying a word.
0:45:30|0:45:37|[Zhang Ga] turned away in anger as Captain Qu walked up to him.
0:46:11|0:46:29|[Zhang Ga] ran away with tears in his eyes. Without the steel-footed gun, [Zhang Ga] felt extremely sad. He held his breath, went to a mound alone, sat down heavily, angrily pulling at the weeds, and suddenly remembered the wooden gun at his waist.
0:46:31|0:46:50|He took out the wooden gun from his waist, almost throwing it away, but Zhang Ga looked at the wooden gun in his hand, thinking of the captured old Zhongshu, feeling even more sad. At this moment, a kid about the same age as Zhang Ga, named Pang Dun, came over.
0:47:2|0:47:24|Seeing that [Zhang Ga] was unwilling, [Pang Dun] scratched his head anxiously. Suddenly, he remembered the string of firecrackers around his waist. So he climbed up the tree with the firecrackers. [Zhang Ga] dragged his cheeks in distress. Suddenly, he saw the string of firecrackers. It turned out that [Pang Dun] intentionally showed it to [Zhang Ga] on the tree.
0:47:33|0:47:37|Looking up, the bird's nest was on the highest branch.
0:48:10|0:48:25|[Zhang Ga] and [Pang Dun] were seen placing firecrackers and wooden guns as prizes for their bet. They took off their belts and stood on a piece of open ground, with their friends gathering around to watch.
0:48:31|0:48:58|At the very beginning, the two of them made a strong stance, pushing against each other. [Zhang Ga] gritted his teeth, but [Pang Dun]'s body was as sturdy as a young calf, firmly holding his ground. [Zhang Ga] bent down, but instead of attacking [Pang Dun]'s lower body, he was hit with a powerful blow from above, knocking him down directly.
0:49:14|0:49:17|[Zhang Ga] took off his coat directly, and the second round began.
0:49:23|0:49:46|The two were wrestling, and [Pang Dun]'s father happened to pass by and came to watch. [Zhang Ga] gritted his teeth, exerted all his strength, trying to bring the opponent down. But [Pang Dun] also exerted all his strength, not giving him any chance at all. The two of them were grappling back and forth, neither giving in, locked in a fierce struggle.
0:49:46|0:49:48|The children on the side are cheering them on.
0:49:56|0:50:10|[Zhang Ga] was no match for the young calf, and was lifted onto [Pang Dun]'s shoulders. The next moment, the two of them were wrestling and rolling down the hill.
0:50:20|0:50:37|Two people were seen getting up from the ground, and the standoff became even more intense. [Zhang Ga] exerted all his strength, but soon after, [Pang Dun] lifted [Zhang Ga] up again. Desperate for victory, [Zhang Ga] even bit [Pang Dun]'s shoulder directly.
0:51:0|0:51:10|[Zhang Ga] awkwardly turned his back and hid behind a tree. At that moment, Pang Dun's father walked over and spoke.
0:51:23|0:51:41|[Pang Dun] followed his father home, and the children all dispersed. [Zhang Ga] had his gun confiscated, lost a bet, and ended up being a sore loser, feeling very frustrated.
0:51:53|0:51:58|[Zhang Ga] walked to the stone in frustration and picked up his clothes.
0:52:20|0:52:39|[Zhang Ga] moves swiftly between the trees, then wanders on the rooftops. He agilely crosses from one rooftop to another, and soon starts pacing back and forth on a ladder.
0:52:39|0:52:45|[Zhang Ga] draped his coat over his body, hands in pockets, occasionally kicking the small stones on the ground with his foot.
0:53:12|0:53:17|After a while, [Zhang Ga] got tired and sat down by a chimney.
0:53:21|0:53:48|Unexpectedly, Zhang Ga was choked by the thick smoke, tears streaming down his face. He leaned over the roof and took a look below. Coincidentally, it was the roof of Pang Dun's house. Zhang Ga cleverly stuffed the hay from the roof into the chimney.
0:53:59|0:54:12|The smoke from the farm indeed all went down, causing Pang Dun and his son to cough. Zhang Ga was laughing secretly, but was caught by Pang Dun.
0:54:20|0:54:32|Back in the courtyard, the team leader placed a basket of cakes in front of [Zhang Ga]. [Zhang Ga] picked up a cake and started chewing on it with big bites.
0:55:31|0:55:41|[Pang Dun]'s father was about to speak, but was stopped by a gesture from the district captain. [Zhang Ga] turned angrily and walked into the house, still making a face at [Pang Dun] through the window.
0:55:44|0:56:3|[Zhang Ga] got off the kang, tiptoed to the door, trying to eavesdrop on the conversation outside. Unfortunately, after leaning in for a while, he couldn't make out a single word. Disappointed, [Zhang Ga] walked over to the spinning wheel and idly turned its wheel.
0:56:13|0:56:31|[Zhang Ga] sat down at the table, put the belt on his head, and opened a notebook to draw something on it. At that moment, Captain Qu came in.
0:57:11|0:57:33|Captain Qu put the food in front of [Zhang Ga], and at this moment, [Luo Jinbao] returned. [Zhang Ga] ran to the door and pricked up his ears to eavesdrop.
0:58:50|0:59:9|Early the next morning, [Pang Dun] had already set up an ambush waiting for the enemy, with [Zhang Ga] among them. The soldiers looked serious, observing the surroundings. In the distance, two large trucks full of soldiers drove by.
0:59:10|0:59:35|As soon as their car entered the ambush circle, it triggered a landmine. With a command from the squad leader, the enemy quickly got out of the car, took out their weapons, and hurriedly fought back. The soldiers shouted and charged towards the enemy.
0:59:36|0:59:47|Facing the strong offensive of our army, the enemy quickly couldn't hold on and had to retreat to the river behind.
0:59:49|1:0:1|On the other side of the river, [Luo Jinbao] with [Zhang Ga] and others had already set up an ambush, waiting for the enemy to take the bait. The soldiers kept a close watch on the river, waiting for the perfect moment.
1:0:7|1:0:31|When the enemy was about to cross the river, [Luo Jinbao] gave the order, and the soldiers threw grenades one after another. With [Luo Jinbao] joining the battle, countless shells flew from all directions, exploding on the river surface. It was a pincer attack, causing the little devils to be surrounded and flee in panic.
1:0:37|1:0:58|[Zhang Ga] also joined the battle, the soldiers rushed down to engage the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. A Japanese soldier raised his sword and came slashing down, just as he met [Luo Jinbao], who swiftly snatched the sword from the enemy's hand, then lifted the Japanese soldier high and threw him heavily into the water.
1:1:4|1:1:23|In the midst of chaos, a pseudo-soldier tried to escape but was caught red-handed by [Zhang Ga]. As the man ran faster, the battle continued fiercely on one side, while [Zhang Ga] was also in pursuit of the escapee on the other side.
1:1:23|1:1:59|In the chaos, the fleeing pseudo-soldier fired a shot at [Zhang Ga], who picked up a stone from the ground and threw it back. The pseudo-soldier fell into the water. As he turned around to continue shooting, he found that the gun was out of bullets. [Zhang Ga] leaped into the water, pounced forward, and wrestled with the pseudo-soldier.
1:2:3|1:2:7|[Zhang Ga] was seen biting down on the pseudo-soldier's wrist, snatching his pistol away.
1:2:17|1:2:38|[Zhang Ga] was very pleased, pressing the puppet troops while looking for the platoon leader. He was holding a real weapon in his hand. Meanwhile, the platoon leader was directing the soldiers to clear the battlefield and collect the spoils. [Zhang Ga] approached while pressing the puppet troops, and when he saw the platoon leader from a distance, he quickly hid the real weapon in his arms.
1:2:41|1:2:55|At this moment, [Luo Jinbao] walked over. [Zhang Ga] hid the gun. [Zhang Ga] pressed the puppet army to the front of the team leader.
1:3:4|1:3:6|The district captain casually patted Zhang Ga's buttocks.
1:3:11|1:3:13|Yang Xiaogen carried [Zhang Ga] on his back.
1:3:38|1:4:3|The scene shifts, the calm water surface reflects the beautiful scenery on the shore, a wooden boat slowly sailing on the river, the injured [Zhang Ga] leaning on the boat, on the opposite side of the boat sits a pretty little girl named Yuying. [Zhang Ga] bows his head and covers his stomach, then takes out a real gun from his arms.
1:4:24|1:4:36|[Zhang Ga] took a boat to Yu Ying's house to recuperate, the boat sailed through dense reeds, with a row of fishing boats in the distance, and the fishermen were busy.
1:5:1|1:5:10|The sunlight spilled onto the water, shimmering through the dewdrops, twinkling.
1:6:1|1:6:21|On the other side, another large group of tail poles slowly moved on the water surface, with the poles reaching the edge of the boat. He reached out and pulled out a tail pole, only to find a person hidden underneath, spraying water all over the face of the pole.
1:6:37|1:6:50|Rumors had it that [Zhang Ga] spotted a large group of Lu porcelain not far away, which made him itch with excitement. Taking advantage of the unguarded moment of the imperial physician, [Zhang Ga] immediately jumped into the water.
1:6:55|1:7:16|[Zhang Ga], who had just gotten out of the water, was even more cheerful than a stove. On the boat, [Luo Jinbao] was sulking by himself. [Zhang Ga] quietly swam over and gently rocked the boat, but [Luo Jinbao] was still angry. She then caught a big fish from a distance and threw it onto the boat. [Luo Jinbao] happily picked up the fish.
1:7:33|1:7:37|[Zhang Ga] picked up an oar and assumed a fighting stance as if wielding a knife.
1:7:51|1:7:57|The boat was swaying back and forth, with voices talking in the background.
1:8:33|1:8:38|Zhang Ga stood on the side of the boat, singing a song while marching in small steps.
1:9:5|1:9:7|[Zhang Ga] excitedly threw himself into his arms.
1:9:21|1:9:27|[Zhang Ga] happily took the package and opened it to find biscuits and canned food.
1:9:31|1:9:35|[Luo Jinbao] took a bag of cookies, then took a can of food, carefully examining them.
1:10:12|1:10:20|Uncle Luo Jinbao had another task and hurriedly boarded the boat without stopping.
1:10:53|1:11:3|Zhang Ga watched as [Luo Jinbao] walked away, his eyes rolling as he started scheming again. Later that night.
1:12:49|1:13:6|After speaking, [Zhang Ga] remembered the captured old Zhongshu, his eyes becoming even more determined. The next morning, as the sky was just getting light, [Luo Jinbao] and his parents caught a basket full of fish and returned home with a full load.
1:13:40|1:13:44|Upon returning home, Zhang Ga found the water tank full of water.
1:13:52|1:14:1|Ruiyin showed the painting on the table to her parents.
1:14:33|1:14:43|[Zhang Ga] returned to the village of Old Man Man's house. As soon as he arrived at the village entrance, he heard a commotion inside.
1:14:52|1:15:5|It turned out that the bandits were robbing the civilians. [Zhang Ga] lifted his jacket to check the real gun hidden at his waist, then headed in another direction.
1:15:12|1:15:38|Originally, this clever little rascal wanted to hide the gun in the bird's nest of the big tree by the river. After a while, two collaborators in the village were swaggering with the ducks they had just stolen, when they suddenly saw [Zhang Ga] walking hurriedly and became suspicious.
1:15:50|1:16:11|[Zhang Ga] turned and ran, the pseudo army soldiers chasing after him with guns. He ran to [Pang Dun]'s house, where he ran into Pang Dun's father who was working.
1:16:17|1:16:43|Uncle Man quickly took [Zhang Ga] into the house, and at this moment, the pseudo army came chasing after them. Uncle Man pretended to have just woken up and went out the door.
1:16:55|1:17:11|The door opened, and out came [Pang Dun] rubbing his eyes. He also stretched lazily. The False Monarch looked him up and down.
1:17:43|1:17:47|Da Zi first opened the curtains, saw the scenery outside, and felt relaxed.
1:18:4|1:18:19|When the pseudo-soldiers were about to take away [Pang Dun], [Zhang Ga] stepped forward.
1:18:34|1:18:39|The bandits grabbed the pole, flipped it over, and aimed a blow at his wrist.
1:19:14|1:19:17|The scene cuts to [Zhang Ga] being taken into the enemy's stronghold.
1:19:41|1:19:45|Captain Wei was about to step forward, but he was knocked down by a pole.
1:19:58|1:20:19|Gui Tian looked at [Zhang Ga], walked up to him and asked. [Zhang Ga] struggled hard, but was firmly held by two pseudo soldiers.
1:20:25|1:20:29|Hey, there's a rebellion in the office being translated over here.
1:20:54|1:21:1|The newcomer took off his hat and bowed, isn't this [Luo Jinbao]?
1:21:21|1:21:27|[Pang Dun] lit a cigarette for [Luo Jinbao].
1:22:3|1:22:17|[Luo Jinbao] nervously looked around and the two of them entered the ceremonial hall, the scene went dark. In the early morning, car after car of food was being transported to the enemy's stronghold.
1:22:27|1:22:45|In the prison cell, [Zhang Ga] was boredly drawing scenes of fighting the Japanese invaders on the wall with small stones. Suddenly, hearing no sound, he quickly sat down. The door opened, and a collaborator came in with food.
1:22:55|1:23:9|[Zhang Ga] picked up a steamed bun with his chopsticks and started chewing on it. Beside him, [Luo Jinbao] squatted on a stool.
1:23:32|1:23:44|Zhang Ga threw a box of matches to Luo Jinbao, asking him to light a cigarette. Zhang Ga stood up, pretended to light the cigarette, but instead stuck the match into the man's nostril.
1:23:49|1:24:8|The pseudo army was furious, almost picking up a chair to smash [Zhang Ga]. At this moment, outside the stronghold, [Luo Jinbao] was observing the situation of the stronghold from a distance on the river. Nearby, the reeds were hiding the boats of the Eighth Route Army, silent and still.
1:24:15|1:24:26|In the evening, several grain-carrying carts arrived at the front of the base, and the captain of the district team, dressed as an old farmer, walked up.
1:24:46|1:25:4|Saying that, he threw a bunch of money up. Zhang Ga smiled when he moved. Luo Jinbao also secretly helped.
1:25:37|1:25:41|The city gate opened, and the grain-carrying carriage came in.
1:25:52|1:26:3|Captain Qu approached the fake soldier and said something. The fake soldier had just taken the cigarette, and the next second he was knocked unconscious by Captain Qu.
1:26:6|1:26:22|The gun was actually hidden under the food. The soldiers armed themselves and prepared for battle. As the platoon leader walked forward, he encountered a pair of Japanese soldiers. When the Japanese soldiers shone their flashlight, they only saw a rough silhouette and one of them asked loudly.
1:26:35|1:27:13|The battle began, with several signal flares lighting up the sky, illuminating the entire sky. [Luo Jinbao], who was ambushed in the reeds, received the signal and led the team towards the stronghold. Amidst the intense gunfire, the company commander in the cell woke up, nervously looking out through the bars, as the Eighth Route Army soldiers carried hay and surged into the stronghold.
1:27:13|1:27:18|The enemies were awakened one by one from their sleep, and the pseudo army captain didn't have time to put on his clothes.
1:27:20|1:27:37|[Gui Tian] pulled out his military knife, concentrating all his strength on a watchtower. The puppet soldiers responsible for guarding the pole also brought it over.
1:27:41|1:28:2|In the building, [Gui Tian] and the fake army captain went upstairs, but they kicked the fake soldier who was supposed to guard [Pang Dun] down the stairs, leaving him to fend for himself. The fake soldier fell down and saw [Pang Dun] mocking him, making him furious.
1:28:13|1:28:42|The sound of gunfire rang out, and the pseudo army cowered in a small corner, even turning off the lights. Meanwhile, Zhang Ga climbed up the ladder with great joy, looking out from the small window of the watchtower, excitedly observing the battle outside. On the other side, a group led by [Luo Jinbao] had already reached the place where the platoon leader was being held captive.
1:28:51|1:29:11|[Luo Jinbao] shot and killed the guard with two shots, rescuing the company commander. At this moment, a group of people first broke through the outer wall and seized the high ground.
1:29:19|1:29:39|At the same time, another Eighth Route Army squad passed through the gate and captured the city wall from another direction. The third squad arrived at the location where the district leader was stationed. They brought several barrels of kerosene, and one person ran up to report to the district leader.
1:30:3|1:30:26|Several Eighth Route Army soldiers carrying firewood and kerosene tried to approach [Ganglou], but the enemy's firepower was too strong, and the soldiers who rushed out fell one after another. [Kuaibanliu], with thick walls, saw this scene and was anxious, wanting to go up personally.
1:30:26|1:30:32|Several people spread a quilt over him, poured soil and water on top, and then covered it with another quilt.
1:30:35|1:31:0|[Zhang Ga], wrapped in a quilt, tried to break out from the earthen wall with fast footwork, but was forced back by a shell. Seizing the opportunity, he tried again. A shell exploded in front of him, making everyone tense up. In the darkness, [Zhang Ga] agilely climbed up and rushed over to ignite the firewood around the harbor building.
1:31:5|1:31:30|Then quickly returned to the safe zone. Captain Xu was very happy. In the guard tower, [Zhang Ga] and Weijun were coughing from the smoke, when suddenly they heard someone shouting. Quick, report to Captain Liu.
1:31:38|1:31:50|Suddenly, the fire in the gang building was extinguished by a hand grenade. Quick-witted Liu wanted to charge again, but he was stopped by the enemy's fierce firepower, as ordered by the platoon leader.
1:32:3|1:32:28|At this moment, in the watchtower, [Zhang Ga] took advantage of the fake king's distraction and quietly moved behind him, knocking him unconscious with a stool. [Zhang Ga] found a box of matches in the fake king's pocket, and then took down the kerosene lamp above his head.
1:33:2|1:33:46|Outside, the district captain was very surprised. The person throwing firewood inside was none other than [Luo Jinbao]. A raging fire broke out in the harbor building, causing chaos among the enemies. [Zhang Ga] looked at their panicked state and felt extremely happy. The American army captain collapsed as he reported to old [Gui Tian].
1:34:0|1:34:22|The enemy, helpless, rushed out of the watchtower only to be surrounded by the Eighth Route Army's torches. In the raging fire, [Zhang Ga] continued to throw firewood inside repeatedly.
1:34:28|1:34:53|When he finally rushed out of the fire, suddenly lit up with a gun, and fell to the ground. Kuai Ban Liu once again put on a quilt and rushed out. He picked up the dry corpse on the ground and rushed back in the dense gunfire.
1:35:2|1:35:7|He ran up to [Luo Jinbao].
1:35:15|1:35:24|The people around were so excited that tears welled up in their eyes. The district captain held [Luo Jinbao] tightly in his arms.
1:35:33|1:35:55|With a bang, the entire harbor building was blown up. The battle was won, and the common people cheered and welcomed the victorious soldiers with gongs and drums. The soldiers sat in the boat, waving excitedly to the people on both sides of the river.
1:35:58|1:36:24|On the shore, the common people were holding baskets filled with their own food, ready to offer it to the Eighth Route Army soldiers. As the boat docked, [Zhang Ga] stepped ashore and handed over Old Gui Tian's military knife to the medic, then turned and ran off. Chun Gang saw the platoon leader and excitedly clenched his injured hand.
1:36:49|1:36:55|Our little hero Zhang Ga was still thinking about the precious hand sign hidden in the bird's nest on the tree.
1:36:57|1:37:2|At the celebration banquet, Zhang Ga is toasting to the district captain and the Eighth Route Army soldiers.
1:37:25|1:37:31|[Zhang Ga] suddenly came back, he pulled the team leader aside and spoke earnestly with his head down.
1:37:57|1:38:22|Yang Xiaogen took out a gun holster from his bag and the team leader put the gun into the holster. [Zhang Ga] was overjoyed and took it, slinging the gun over his shoulder.
1:38:33|1:38:42|The old Zhongshu held Zhang Ga, then took out something from his pocket and mysteriously put it into Zhang Ga's palm. Zhang Ga opened his hand to take a look.
1:38:52|1:39:16|[Zhang Ga] joyfully threw himself into Uncle Chungang's arms, who was overjoyed and tearful. In a flash, [Zhang Ga] leaped onto Uncle Manman, and as he turned his head, Yuying arrived.
1:39:25|1:39:38|The voice girl gave the shoes to [Zhang Ga]. [Zhang Ga] directly hung the shoes around his neck, and then the voice girl tried to give him eggs, but [Zhang Ga] only took two and ran away.
1:39:48|1:40:5|[Zhang Ga] casually pointed in a direction, hung his shoes on the shoulder of the sanitation worker, then ran over to [Luo Jinbao] and tried to give him two eggs. Afterwards, [Zhang Ga] returned to the side of the team leader and took the steamed bun handed to him by the old lady.
1:40:5|1:40:9|At this moment, [Pang Dun] ran over with his string of firecrackers, and [Zhang Ga] went to meet him.
1:40:17|1:40:37|[Zhang Ga] took the firecrackers, suddenly remembered something, pulled out a real gun from his waist, then handed the wooden gun to [Pang Dun], and [Pang Dun] saluted [Zhang Ga].
