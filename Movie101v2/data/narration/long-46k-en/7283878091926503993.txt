0:1:34|0:1:55|The first group of staff from the Chinese delegation flew to Indonesia to attend the Asian-African Conference on an Air India plane named Kashmir Princess from Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong. Unexpectedly, the plane encountered an accident on its way to Indonesia. The footage shows that at 16:38, the Kashmir Princess exploded and crashed in the airspace over the South China Sea.
0:1:56|0:2:16|When the US and Taiwan were smugly preparing to celebrate their successful assassination, [Zhou Enlai] and the Chinese delegation were in Kunming preparing to go to Yangon for the conference, not on the plane at all. On April 12th, the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the crash of the plane carrying the staff of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference due to sabotage by Kuomintang agents.
0:2:17|0:2:28|The British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong were requested to thoroughly investigate. On the evening of April 11, 1955, in Kunming, under the rainy night sky, several leaders were having a meeting.
0:2:58|0:3:1|Tomorrow they will fly back to China on a special plane of Air India.
0:3:10|0:3:14|At this moment, a man dressed in Zhongshan suit walked in holding an umbrella.
0:3:49|0:4:6|The soldier opened the car door, and the Indonesian Prime Minister [Sukarno] quickly walked up the steps with a briefcase in hand, passing through the corridor and heading towards the conference room. After the plane crash, many leaders were adopting a wait-and-see attitude towards the Asian-African Conference, so he had to report the situation to the President immediately.
0:4:6|0:4:10|Indonesian President Sukarno saw him with a serious expression and asked him.
0:4:20|0:4:29|After the plane crash, trouble and chaos ensued. [Sukarno] took the telegram and read it carefully. After a moment, he took off his glasses, stood up, and spoke to the others.
0:4:36|0:4:38|[Sukarno] listened with a worried expression and said.
0:5:29|0:5:42|[Shastri Amizoyo] nodded in agreement after listening. [Sukarno] stood up from the sofa and walked slowly towards the balcony. Behind him, [Shastri Amizoyo] sat on the sofa, staring blankly at his back.
0:5:42|0:5:51|[Sukarno] stood on the balcony, gazing into the distance with his eyes. He had his hands behind his back, lost in thought. [Zhou Enlai] nodded in agreement.
0:5:57|0:6:4|The plane crash deeply saddened him, and he immediately blurted out his thoughts in a confused manner. He solemnly said.
0:6:17|0:6:29|A young man walked towards him with documents in his hand. Seeing Wu Nu meditating, the young man stopped in his tracks. He waited until Wu Nu finished meditating and stood up before approaching him with the documents.
0:6:37|0:6:49|Wu Nu listened with a furrowed brow, holding the telegram in his hand, lost in thought. After a moment of contemplation, he turned to the young man and said. Upon hearing this, the young man quickly took out pen and paper.
0:7:49|0:7:56|Sunlight spilled onto the majestic palace, and [Nehru]'s daughter walked out of the palace holding a milk bottle.
0:9:1|0:9:11|Ambassador Zongming Yao from the Embassy of Zumin called. Rose has summoned the diplomats stationed in Bluetooth and the Southeast Asian nobility for a secret meeting that has been going on in the sunshine for two days.
0:9:12|0:9:27|In studying countermeasures, Dulles' demand is to turn the Bandung Conference into a potential platform for communism. Among the 29 countries participating in the Bandung Conference, only 6 have diplomatic relations with us. 22 countries have accepted American aid.
0:9:32|0:9:36|Several countries have just joined the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact Organization.
0:10:15|0:10:17|Prime Minister Zhou Enlai suddenly burst into a smile tomorrow.
0:11:10|0:11:20|[Sastroamidjojo] walked into the Indonesian president's official residence with a briefcase, smiling, to deliver some good news to President [Sukarno]. Upon hearing the president's praise, he finally breathed a sigh of relief.
0:11:53|0:12:3|Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia [Huang Zhen] and his wife Zhu Lin arrived in Jakarta. Amidst enthusiastic applause, a group of people pushed an elderly man towards them.
0:13:40|0:13:50|After a burst of firecrackers, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia was officially established. Amidst the enthusiastic applause of overseas Chinese, the Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, [Huang Zhen], began to deliver a speech.
0:14:10|0:14:21|The scene was filled with thunderous applause, with overseas Chinese smiling and eagerly anticipating the arrival of [Zhou Enlai]. In a quiet study, [Zhou Enlai] was sitting at the desk, writing a reply to Deng Yingchao.
0:15:1|0:15:23|On April 14th, [Zhou Enlai] and his delegation arrived in Rangoon on the Indian Airlines' Skyraider. On April 15th, [Zhou Enlai] met with leaders from Rangoon, U Nu, Nehru, Nasser, Fan Wentong, and Naim Khan to discuss the format of the upcoming Asian-African Conference.
0:15:23|0:15:31|On April 16th, the Chinese government delegation arrived in Jakarta on the "Sky King" plane. Inside the airport, soldiers were nervously preparing.
0:15:37|0:15:42|After shaking hands with Prime Minister [Shastri Amarjyot], we escorted [Zhou Enlai] quickly towards the convoy.
0:16:7|0:16:21|A small car with the national flag inserted drove towards the crowd, inside of which sat the Indonesian Prime Minister [Sukarno]. People with flags in their hands eagerly awaited the arrival of [Zhou Enlai].
0:16:22|0:16:27|Although Zhou Enlai did not stay at the presidential palace this time, President Sukarno still sent a national car.
0:16:36|0:16:41|Accompanied by the roar of the plane, [Zhou Enlai]'s special aircraft arrived at Jakarta's Marhalan Airport.
0:16:43|0:16:55|The plane appeared in people's sight, immediately causing cheers. Reporters rushed forward eagerly, just to capture photos of Prime Minister [Zhou Enlai]. The plane landed smoothly, and the band immediately played symphonic music.
0:16:55|0:17:11|When [Zhou Enlai] Prime Minister appeared at the cabin door in high spirits, waving to the welcoming crowd, the airport immediately erupted in excitement. Everyone rushed forward just to catch a glimpse of this Chinese Prime Minister's charm, unable to help but let out a chorus of blessings and cheers.
0:17:12|0:17:26|[Zhou Enlai] stepped off the plane, warmly shaking hands with the Indonesian Prime Minister, [Sukarno]. People waved their national flags, expressing their joy from the heart. Children held flowers and enthusiastically presented them to Prime Minister [Zhou Enlai].
0:17:26|0:17:40|The two prime ministers walked in the front, followed closely by others. Seeing the enthusiastic overseas Chinese, [Zhou Enlai] waved to them warmly. Indonesian soldiers stood ready, holding weapons, guarding attentively on both sides.
0:17:40|0:17:45|After walking out of the cheers of the crowd, [Huang Zhen] stood beside Prime Minister [Zhou Enlai] and whispered to him.
0:17:56|0:18:0|Indonesian Prime Minister invited [Zhou Enlai] into the car, [Huang Zhen] saw this and called for his wife.
0:18:30|0:18:47|The Chinese delegation set off for the embassy, but the journey was filled with fear and anxiety. [Huang Zhen] wiped his sweat with a handkerchief and looked at Prime Minister [Chen Yi]. Prime Minister [Chen Yi] took off his sunglasses and vigilantly observed the surroundings outside the car. Along the long road, the friendly Wanlong crowd filled both sides of the road.
0:18:47|0:18:53|As the Chinese delegation's convoy slowly drove through the crowd, people waved their national flags and cheered.
0:18:54|0:19:11|But this did not relax the Chinese delegation, instead it became even more nervous. [Zhu Lin] sat in the first car, tightly gripping the handrail inside the car, not daring to relax at all. The crowd outside was very enthusiastic, some holding national flags, some playing music, standing on both sides of the road, as if in a festive parade.
0:19:11|0:19:28|Sitting in the passenger seat, the young assistant loosened his collar and kept a vigilant eye on the crowd around him. At this moment, he couldn't hear the lively cheers outside at all, his only concern was the safety of Prime Minister [Zhou Enlai]. The streets were lined with long banners with welcoming messages, and there were too many onlookers in the crowd.
0:19:28|0:19:39|They stood one after another, some even climbed onto trees and railings, just to catch a glimpse of [Zhou Enlai]. They waved flags, cheered loudly, expressing their excitement.
0:19:40|0:20:6|Indonesian people sing patriotic songs, "Hello, Hello Wanlong", expressing their joy. Chinese people wave the Five-Star Red Flag and cheer, "Long live China and Indonesia, long live the People's Republic of China." In front of the embassy, people have gathered early to visit [Zhou Enlai].
0:20:19|0:20:24|In the end, the two of them arrived at [Zhou Enlai]'s room together, and he smiled and said.
0:21:8|0:21:14|The Chinese delegation entered the room one after another, Zhu Lingfu bent down, whispered a few words in Huang Zhen's ear, and then left.
0:21:34|0:21:36|[Zhou Enlai] immediately spoke up as soon as he heard.
0:21:42|0:21:55|President Sukarno's ruling Indonesian National Party and other major parties mostly supported signing the treaty, with only a few opposition parties causing trouble.
0:21:58|0:22:1|Chen Yi listened and then expressed his thoughts, what did he say.
0:22:38|0:22:49|Maigong and his granddaughter sat in a small sedan heading towards the embassy. The granddaughter held Maigong's arm, her eyes fixed on the window without blinking. Maigong gently patted her hand when he noticed.
0:22:49|0:23:6|At night, under the rainy sky, a crowd gathers in front of the embassy to visit [Zhou Enlai]. They hold umbrellas and wear raincoats, with rain soaking their hair, but they pay no attention. Suddenly, a young man in a raincoat steps out of a car, holding a loaf of bread as he walks towards the crowd.
0:23:8|0:23:24|The old man took the food and looked towards the embassy. It's not just young people here, old people and children have also come to the front of the embassy. They were full of joy, not at all affected by the heavy rain. At this moment, a car slowly drove towards the embassy gate.
0:23:28|0:23:32|People, as if seeing hope, excitedly walked towards the car.
0:24:7|0:24:9|[Zhou Enlai] turned to Huang Zhen and said.
0:24:15|0:24:17|[Zhou Enlai] said with satisfaction.
0:24:38|0:24:50|At this moment, the rain outside has stopped, and the crowd becomes even more excited. With great anticipation, everyone looks towards the door, finally welcoming Prime Minister [Zhou Enlai].
0:24:55|0:25:11|The door slowly opened, and [Zhou Enlai], along with Chen Yi and Huang Zhen, entered everyone's sight. The crowd was excited to see them. They stared at the crowd intently, craning their necks to get a better look, with happy smiles on their faces. Then, Huang Zhen spoke to everyone:
0:25:50|0:25:59|[Zhou Enlai] pondered for a moment before saying, "Soon, the lights in the courtyard all lit up, and everyone was excited."
0:27:17|0:27:31|In the city of Bandung, located in the Bandung Basin in western Java, Indonesia, surrounded by peaks, with beautiful scenery, lush vegetation, and a spring-like climate all year round, it is known as the most beautiful city in Indonesia and is often referred to as the Paris of Java.
0:27:31|0:27:39|On a vast grassland, [Zhou Enlai] in a shirt and bow tie, is conducting with a smile on his face, while children are singing joyful songs.
0:27:40|0:27:54|Their singing voices were loud and powerful, the beautiful girls waved flags in their hands, performing brilliantly. Various musical instruments played out melodious music under the children's hands. They greeted the arrival of representatives from various countries with smiles and enthusiasm.
0:27:56|0:28:13|On the morning of April 18, 1955, the highly anticipated Asian-African Conference opened at the Bandung Independence Building, with soldiers raising flags of various countries high, signaling the official start of the conference. No. 10 Daman Shari Street was the temporary residence of the Chinese delegation in Bandung.
0:28:13|0:28:31|Outside the door, the bright red five-star flag fluttered. [Zhou Enlai] and his entourage looked at the flag, lost in thought, as the area outside the door was crowded with people who came to visit Premier Zhou. Seeing this, [Zhou Enlai] warmly waved and greeted them. The responding crowd cheered and clapped joyfully through the door frame at this moment.
0:28:34|0:28:50|To ensure the personal safety of the participants, most delegates from various countries wore their own national costumes. The colorful styles of these costumes formed a splendid scenery in the venue, with crowds of onlookers outside and ambassadors from various countries warmly waving to them.
0:28:50|0:28:57|The Chinese delegation marched with firm steps in the second place, while Indonesian soldiers stood by the road with determined eyes.
0:29:3|0:29:20|At 9:00 a.m. on April 18, 1955, the opening ceremony of the Asian-African Conference officially began. The band played the national anthem of Indonesia, and leaders from various countries entered the venue one after another. There was enthusiastic applause, and journalists from various countries stood on both sides of the aisle, vying to take photos of the leaders. [Zhou Enlai] and his entourage entered the venue.
0:29:20|0:29:29|[Zhou Enlai] was warmly welcomed by everyone. Ambassadors from various countries entered the venue one after another, greeting people around them in a friendly manner, creating a harmonious and pleasant atmosphere.
0:29:29|0:29:45|[Zhou Enlai] met with former Iraqi Prime Minister Jumaili in the aisle. He kindly let the other party go first, but to his surprise, Jumaili looked displeased. While people around were still applauding and welcoming, Jumaili had already arrogantly taken his seat, with a disdainful expression, completely out of sync with those around him. Premier Chen Yi sat inside wearing sunglasses.
0:29:48|0:30:6|Once everything was in place, a male journalist deliberately approached [Zhou Enlai] and recorded this moment for him. The ambassadors of various countries had already entered the venue. The Indonesian Prime Minister glanced at the Indonesian President [Sukarno] beside him, who nodded in response, and he immediately understood the meaning.
0:30:23|0:30:29|[Sukarno] stood up, walked towards the podium, and delivered a passionate and stirring speech.
0:30:58|0:31:1|This statement immediately won a round of applause from everyone.
0:31:31|0:31:38|[Sukarno]'s speech was unanimously recognized, even the people outside the venue applauded him warmly, and then he continued.
0:31:52|0:32:9|After [Sukarno]'s speech, there were mixed reactions among the audience. As he returned to his seat, he warmly waved to the crowd. At that moment, a foreign journalist noticed something unusual. A small car with a five-starred red flag drove into the courtyard.
0:32:9|0:32:22|[Huang Zhen] got out of the car, holding a briefcase, and quickly walked into the house. The people inside were having a meal, and [Zhu Lin] stood up to greet him. He just waved his hand in response, then hurriedly went straight to [Zhou Enlai].
0:32:58|0:33:6|[Zhou Enlai] nodded at [Huang Zhen] and then paused for a moment before expressing his thoughts.
0:33:24|0:33:42|According to the agreement reached at the preparatory meeting, after the opening ceremony, the original plan was to proceed directly to the secret meeting. Following a proposal by the Pakistani representative, all delegations negotiated and decided to change today and tomorrow into plenary sessions, allowing each country's delegation to speak for 20 minutes.
0:33:42|0:33:54|India, Myanmar, China, and Indonesia have indicated that they are not going to speak at the plenary session. The rest of the delegations will speak at the conference in the agreed order.
0:33:55|0:34:5|With these words, the meeting officially entered the first phase, with representatives from various countries giving speeches. The first speaker was the former King of Cambodia, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, followed by the Prime Minister of Egypt, Nasser.
0:34:8|0:34:15|Following are the pillars of the Japanese Economic Planning Agency, Takagi, and the Syrian Foreign Minister, Azem.
0:34:17|0:34:43|Laos Prime Minister Kaysone, Lebanese Prime Minister Solh, and the majority of representatives all hope that the conference will contribute to promoting world peace, strengthening normal economic cooperation, and condemning colonialism and racism. However, due to instigation by the United States, former Iraqi Prime Minister Gamal sang a different tune.
0:34:43|0:34:50|Gamma Liang walked up to the podium with a proud smile, head held high. Zhou Enlai watched his back, deep in thought.
0:35:43|0:35:45|The journalist also started taking photos non-stop.
0:35:51|0:36:1|[Zhou Enlai] frowned, picked up a pen and wrote angrily on the paper, while the people below were discussing. He asked the person next to him to pass the note to [Chen Yi].
0:36:15|0:36:22|[Sukarno] tapped the small wooden hammer, trying to maintain order in the meeting room, but it was ineffective. [Jamal] then started to appeal.
0:36:33|0:36:47|In this hall, the voice of America can be heard. At this moment, the journalist did not film [Jia Moli] speaking on stage, but turned the camera towards [Zhou Enlai] sitting in the audience.
0:36:58|0:37:19|The delegates from various countries stood up and left the meeting room. However, [Zhou Enlai] met [Jamali] again in the aisle. He politely gestured for [Jamali] to go first, but to his surprise, she showed a fierce expression with a hostile look in her eyes.
0:37:19|0:37:25|The Chinese delegation is returning to their residence by car, while [Zhu Ling] is setting up a memorial for the 11 victims.
0:37:45|0:37:51|As soon as the words fell, the Chinese delegation arrived at the residence, and the assistant opened the car door for them.
0:38:21|0:38:31|The crowd fell silent upon hearing this, walking into the venue with heavy hearts. What greeted their eyes were eleven urns placed on the table.
0:38:31|0:38:42|Seeing this scene, everyone's footsteps came to a halt. After a moment of contemplation, they approached the table, the solemn and quiet meeting room, the poignant bowl curtains and flower wreaths, causing everyone's expressions to become solemn.
0:38:43|0:38:59|They stood together in the middle of the venue, with [Zhou Enlai] leaning forward slightly to get a better look at their faces. Each small urn was labeled with a photo and name, and there were charred remnants in the nearby trays. After a moment of hesitation, he walked up and reached out to touch the urn.
0:39:0|0:39:18|[Zhou Enlai] took out a handkerchief from his pocket and carefully wiped the photo on the urn for them. After a moment, he tremblingly picked up the shattered remains on the tray, his brows furrowed, tears already filling his eyes. Tears streamed down his face, constantly wiping away the tears with his hands.
0:39:18|0:39:27|Chen Yi also bent down, looking at their photos with great sorrow. He was so overwhelmed with grief that he couldn't speak for a moment. Many comrades behind him also bowed their heads in mourning.
0:39:28|0:39:45|At the meeting, tears of sadness flowed, and with tear-streaked faces, [Zhou Enlai] slowly stood up, looking ahead with a determined gaze and letting out a deep sigh. The atmosphere on the scene was both sorrowful and solemn, with many comrades instinctively taking out handkerchiefs, removing their glasses, and wiping tears from their eyes with a heavy heart.
0:39:45|0:39:54|These eleven comrades came for the meeting, but unfortunately died on the way, causing great sorrow to everyone. The Asian-African Conference this time is also full of crises.
0:40:33|0:40:35|In the audience, people were discussing animatedly.
0:41:14|0:41:24|Now. Please let the Philippine President's special envoy Mr. Romulo speak.
0:42:6|0:42:16|Following Zhou Enlai's instructions, Pu Shouchang slowly walked towards the podium and submitted our country's speech application to the host, Shastri Amizoyo. As soon as these words were spoken, it caused a stir among the audience.
0:42:29|0:42:48|[Zhou Enlai] returned to his residence, walked into the room, stood in front of the desk lost in thought. Seeing this, everyone looked puzzled, exchanged glances, and the man behind couldn't help but speak up. However, [Zhou Enlai] still did not respond to him. Everyone looked at each other, at a loss. [Zhou Enlai] turned around and spoke.
0:42:51|0:43:7|The man nodded, sincere and strong, waved to everyone to leave. After everyone left, [Zhou Enlai] pulled a chair to the desk, tidied up the right side of the table, placed paper and pen, and waited for Pu Shouchang to arrive. Downstairs, Zhu Ling was also busy for the Prime Minister.
0:43:19|0:43:33|Chen Yi sat alone at the dining table, absentmindedly eating while the wind howled outside and thunderstorms raged. [Zhou Enlai] and Pu Shouchang were busy preparing for Xia Wu's speech, with the desk covered in papers, but his pen continued to write non-stop.
0:43:55|0:43:57|They walked towards the front desk with a telegram in their hands.
0:44:15|0:44:29|Chen Yi dropped the fan and picked up the letter. Upon hearing it, Zhou Enlai immediately became serious, quickly turned off the radio, walked to the desk, put on his glasses, and started reading carefully.
0:45:5|0:45:13|Chen Yi finished reading, his face changed drastically. He took off his glasses, gave the two a meaningful look, sat down slowly, and slammed the letter hard on the table.
0:45:38|0:45:49|Upon receiving Chen Yi's orders, [Zhou Enlai], a member of the security team, immediately began preparations. He tucked a handgun into his pocket and, after a quick check, showed no signs of any flaws.
0:45:49|0:46:4|He stood up and walked to the mirror, looking at himself in the mirror for a rehearsal, aiming the gun, performing a set of movements smoothly, all to ensure the personal safety of [Zhou Enlai]. Outside the meeting venue in the afternoon, the crowd was packed, and a small sedan with the five-star red flag drove towards the entrance of the venue.
0:47:7|0:47:21|Now please let Prince Naradhip of Thailand make a speech at the conference.
0:47:30|0:47:38|In the neighboring Yunnan Province of China, which is encouraging the Dai people to implement autonomy, [Zhou Enlai] began writing with a pen.
0:48:21|0:48:34|The speech by the Thai representative, Prince Wan, has caused dissatisfaction among many delegates. Making such remarks in front of the Chinese delegation has instantly tense the atmosphere of the meeting, but [Zhou Enlai] remained smiling. As soon as the words were spoken, all eyes turned to [Zhou Enlai].
0:48:46|0:48:59|The journalists who were originally outside the hall immediately rushed into the hall. They also wanted to get the news as soon as possible. The hall was quiet, with all the lights on. Under the gaze of the whole audience, [Zhou Enlai] stood up and walked towards the rostrum.
0:48:59|0:49:10|[Zhou Enlai] holding the speech manuscript, walked with firm steps, passed rows of seats, and ascended the podium in the middle of the stage. Representatives from various countries in the audience all put on their translators, eagerly anticipating [Zhou Enlai]'s speech.
0:49:10|0:49:18|[Zhou Enlai] stood on the stage, looked around the venue with a sharp gaze, and then began his brilliant speech.
0:49:32|0:49:41|[Zhou Enlai] spoke unexpectedly in his first sentence, firmly stating his position. The Thai Foreign Minister looked serious, and the audience listened attentively. After the American representative finished listening, a look of helplessness appeared on his face.
0:50:10|0:50:12|His speech was also being broadcast.
0:50:19|0:50:21|The audience outside the venue was also listening attentively.
0:50:34|0:50:42|He presented the facts directly. However, the Chinese delegation did not do so. His speech was tolerant and thought-provoking.
0:50:48|0:50:50|Burmese Prime Minister Wu Nu refused to listen attentively.
0:50:57|0:51:4|Among us, there was a moment of silence as everyone waited for [Zhou Enlai] to speak.
0:51:51|0:51:54|China has no intention of overthrowing neighboring governments.
0:52:18|0:52:31|With these words, the audience erupted into thunderous applause, their faces showing satisfaction as they clapped in approval. However, the proud Jia Mali had a worried expression, and several American representatives also displayed displeasure.
0:52:58|0:53:1|The American representative listened with a wry smile.
0:53:19|0:53:21|Chen Yi frowned, filled with worry.
0:53:35|0:53:51|[Zhou Enlai]'s speech was very well received. Burmese Prime Minister U Nu did not glance at Indian Prime Minister [Nehru], but after the two made eye contact, they nodded in agreement. Seeing this, the few representatives who had previously sung a different tune could only reluctantly applaud.
0:53:51|0:54:2|The scene was buzzing with excitement, unable to calm down. [Zhou Enlai] hesitated to speak, so he could only clap along and wait for the right moment. He passionately called on everyone.
0:55:8|0:55:20|[Zhou Enlai] smiled and shook hands with Ying Ge, surrounded by representatives from various countries. He warmly greeted each of them with a handshake. They all had smiles on their faces, with admiration in their eyes for [Zhou Enlai].
0:55:20|0:55:28|[Zhou Enlai] returned to his seat, the crowd around him still not dispersing. He exchanged a few words with Chen Yi and the people around him, who nodded in agreement.
0:55:29|0:55:50|As soon as he sat down, people around [Zhou Enlai] handed him notebooks to sign. He gently took the notebooks and signed them carefully. In the evening, [Zhou Enlai] and the Chinese delegation attended a reception hosted by Indonesian President [Sukarno]. There was a spectacular performance on the lawn, and the two of them walked slowly towards the venue.
0:56:8|0:56:16|The waiter brought them wine, they raised their glasses, and [Sukarno] continued to speak to [Zhou Enlai].
0:57:1|0:57:11|[Sukarno] introduced the little girl in a skirt. Meijia looked over curiously and quickly ran towards [Sukarno].
0:57:21|0:57:30|[Zhou Enlai] gently continued to question him, right? He looked surprised, and everyone burst into laughter.
0:57:58|0:58:1|Prime Minister [Sukarno] said to Chen Yi. Chen Yi responded calmly.
0:58:26|0:58:41|[Zhou Enlai] happened to meet [Nehru] at the banquet. [Nehru] said to [Zhou Enlai].
0:59:0|0:59:2|Yes, reported the Reuters journalist.
0:59:18|0:59:25|As soon as the words fell, a group of people on the stage attracted their attention with the Angolong. The conductor at the head greeted everyone with great respect and said.
0:59:44|0:59:50|At the invitation of the girls, representatives from various countries walked onto the stage with musical instruments in hand. The conductor spoke to them.
0:59:56|1:0:8|Several delegates held Angklung and gently shook them to make a sound. Under the guidance of the conductor, they performed a simple routine in sequence before officially entering the performance stage. The conductor directed them to play according to the musical notes.
1:0:20|1:0:28|The atmosphere on the scene was joyful, with the representatives all having a great time. Zhou Enlai quickly intervened to stop them.
1:0:31|1:0:49|After the previous rehearsal, this performance is clearly more successful. They swayed the angklung in their hands according to the conductor's gestures, and the beautiful music lingered throughout the venue under their performance. The audience below applauded, clapping their hands to the beat, and started singing along with the music of the angklung.
1:0:49|1:0:56|They were all infected by this harmonious and friendly atmosphere, standing up one after another and walking towards the stage to sing together with everyone.
1:0:57|1:1:10|[Zhou Enlai] and Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the daughter of the Indian Prime Minister, sat together clapping, happily singing songs. Even the black representative joined in the singing with everyone, clapping and walking towards the stage.
1:1:10|1:1:18|This song also perfectly demonstrates the Indonesian people's welcome to representatives from various countries. The music on stage becomes more and more intense, and the atmosphere at the scene reaches its climax.
1:1:19|1:1:36|This banquet not only helped the representatives establish friendly relationships, but also brought them closer to each other. As the banquet came to an end amidst the laughter and chatter, the representatives from various countries gathered in front of the stage and sang together in unison. Their faces were filled with happy smiles, and their bodies swayed to the rhythm of the music with joy.
1:1:37|1:1:50|The next day, the sun shone on Wanlong, where the scenery was beautiful and the climate pleasant. Many modern buildings added to the beauty of the city. However, in such a beautiful city, the delegation led by [Zhou Enlai] was extremely busy.
1:1:50|1:2:2|On that day, [Zhou Enlai] successively met with the head of the Cambodian delegation, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Prime Minister of Myanmar, U Nu, and representatives from Indonesia, including President Sukarno, engaging in friendly and harmonious conversations with them.
1:2:3|1:2:31|Watching their departing figures, [Zhou Enlai] bid farewell to the delegation with a smile. That evening, [Zhou Enlai] continued his work. [Zhou Enlai] interrupted him. Starting from eight o'clock today, a secret meeting will be held all day, divided into a Political Committee, composed of the heads of delegations from various countries.
1:2:31|1:2:34|At one o'clock in the afternoon, [Zhou Enlai] was already dozing off while standing.
1:3:4|1:3:6|[Zhou Enlai] suddenly woke up and gave instructions to his assistant.
1:3:10|1:3:15|As soon as the words fell, [Zhou Enlai] let out a big yawn, it was almost five o'clock.
1:3:33|1:3:46|Zhou Enlai stood up and said with concern. He nodded and walked to the desk, raised his hand to turn off the desk lamp, and said to the people outside the door.
1:3:51|1:4:2|[Zhou Enlai] lifted the covers and sat on the bed, wanting to sleep. Just as he lay down, he hesitated. He lifted his foot to get on the bed, but hesitated upon seeing the clean and tidy sheets. He put his foot down and reached out to lift the bedding at the foot of the bed.
1:4:45|1:4:59|During a press conference, Prime Minister Kotelawala of Ceylon took out his documents to show to everyone, but the journalists below were whispering to each other. After some discussion, a female journalist raised her hand to ask him a question.
1:5:14|1:5:16|[Zhou Enlai] enters the hall.
1:5:54|1:5:58|There are two aspects of mental incompetence here.
1:6:5|1:6:13|The United States has deployed troops in Taiwan, causing tension in the region. This issue has now become an international problem.
1:7:19|1:7:25|At the Cairo Conference, Mr. Du issued a rule to the American delegation that no one was allowed to shake hands with the Chinese.
1:8:20|1:8:46|The American ambassador to Indonesia marked the telegram as Class 4A, he said solemnly. These 69 words may seem a bit broad, but they are very logically rigorous, and also contain bold and proactive initiative.
1:8:47|1:9:2|This can be said to be a rescue chapter of [Zhou Enlai] at the so-called Asian-African Conference. These are three carefully considered sentences. He just needed to seize an opportunity to play his cards right.
1:9:2|1:9:13|It was Zhou Enlai who sent out such a thought-provoking brief signal in Bandung, leading to the first Sino-US ambassadorial-level talks held in Geneva on August 1, 1955.
1:9:14|1:9:27|The protracted ambassadorial-level talks served as a direct channel of communication between the two countries. It opened an important chapter in the history of Sino-US relations. In the kitchen, a chef is carefully carving a radish.
1:9:43|1:9:53|[Zhou Enlai] called Zhu Lin over after watching for a moment.
1:10:13|1:10:20|[Zhou Enlai] walked towards the door while buttoning up his shirt. Suddenly, he noticed that the fan in the living room was on, so he quickly walked over to turn it off.
1:10:29|1:10:46|In the courtyard, under the protection of soldiers, [Sukarno] arrived at the gate in a small sedan, where Chen Yi was already waiting. With the escort of guards, [Sukarno] and [Sastroamidjojo] slowly got out of the car. [Zhou Enlai] and Chen Yi quickly walked up to greet them warmly with a handshake.
1:10:46|1:10:50|Both sides met very harmoniously and they walked into the room together.
1:10:51|1:11:6|Just as she entered, [Sukarno] was drawn to the turned-off fan, smiling as she looked at [Zhou Enlai] beside her. They shared a knowing smile, and without saying a word, [Zhou Enlai] invited her to continue walking forward. It was a sunny and breezy day on April 22, 1955.
1:11:10|1:11:27|The Chinese delegation signed the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence Agreement" with the Indonesian side. [Zhou Enlai] shook hands friendly with the other party, exchanged agreements, and the atmosphere on the scene was peaceful. Indonesia was also the first country to sign an agreement with China. In the afternoon, [Zhou Enlai] attended the Overseas Chinese Association held at the Zhaoqing Club.
1:11:27|1:11:32|Overseas Chinese were very excited to see [Zhou Enlai], and the applause was continuous.
1:12:57|1:13:0|[Zhou Enlai] pondered for a moment before speaking to everyone.
1:13:13|1:13:30|[Zhou Enlai]'s response was unanimously approved by everyone, and everyone was very satisfied. The secret meeting the next day was held as scheduled at the Red and White Flag Building. Representatives from various countries arrived at the building by special cars, walking through the long corridor to the meeting room one by one. There were also journalists from various countries taking photos and reporting around.
1:13:30|1:13:33|The host warmly greeted everyone and gestured for them to take a seat.
1:13:39|1:13:41|Nehru's daughter and the Chinese representative are waiting.
1:15:33|1:15:36|The Pakistani representative stood up in anger.
1:16:1|1:16:18|Jamaari arrogantly made a speech, leaving Nehru infuriated. He threw down the translation headphones, picked up his cane, and left the venue without looking back. The crowd immediately started discussing. Zhou Enlai, seeing this, raised his hand to signal to Shastri Amizoyo to speak.
1:16:27|1:16:41|[Nehru] walked ahead on his own, completely oblivious to his daughter calling out to him from behind. She caught up to him and the journalists nearby couldn't help but smirk at the scene.
1:17:10|1:17:15|At this moment, [Nehru] returned to the venue and, ignoring the gazes of the crowd, sat back in his seat.
1:18:5|1:18:9|The crowd nodded in agreement, and [Zhou Enlai] continued,
1:18:25|1:18:30|The assistant began distributing the documents, to the displeasure of Jia Mali, as [Zhou Enlai] continued speaking.
1:18:56|1:19:10|After [Zhou Enlai] finished speaking, representatives from various countries began to read the proposal seriously, and the venue fell silent. A guard at the door couldn't help but try to eavesdrop on the conversation, but another soldier stopped him. Soon, there was a round of applause, leaving the reporters outside looking puzzled.
1:19:13|1:19:31|Night falls, stars twinkle, [Zhou Enlai] invites leaders from various countries to a dinner party. The courtyard is bustling with many people. A car with national flags drives into the courtyard, and the Prime Minister of Pakistan gets out of the car and warmly shakes hands with [Zhou Enlai].
1:19:45|1:19:51|Following that, Thai Foreign Minister Prince Wanaradi arrived, and [Zhou Enlai] stepped forward to shake hands with him.
1:19:58|1:20:2|Philippine President's special envoy Romulo gets out of the car.
1:20:6|1:20:23|[Zhou Enlai] smiled happily. [Zhou Enlai] led the representatives of various countries into the hall. A female attendant brought three chairs and placed them in the middle. A photographer set up a camera in front, ready to take photos for everyone. [Zhou Enlai] looked around, and Mrs. Indira Gandhi, daughter of [Nehru], said to him.
1:20:23|1:20:35|Zhou Enlai pointed to the chair in front again. Indira was pleasantly surprised. He walked towards Zhu Lin on the side and spoke to her.
1:20:40|1:20:48|[Zhou Enlai] nodded in agreement, and Zhu Ling suddenly understood that Nehru was supposed to stand in the middle with [Zhou Enlai], but he shook his head and stood behind instead.
1:20:50|1:21:3|The photographer held a flash, found the right moment, pressed the shutter, and captured one precious group photo after another. Afterwards, everyone entered the banquet hall together for the dining session. At this moment, the sky lit up with dazzling fireworks.
1:21:3|1:21:13|In the banquet hall, [Zhou Enlai] stood up, raised his glass, and addressed the representatives of various countries present.
1:21:51|1:21:58|The delegates from various countries raised their glasses and took a sip. [Zhou Enlai] walked to the center and gestured for everyone to sit down, then the discussion continued.
1:22:11|1:22:13|The crowd looked puzzled, and the assistant explained.
1:22:44|1:23:0|At 9:30 p.m. on April 24, 1955, the Asian-African Conference successfully concluded. The Bandung Conference provided New China with the opportunity to freely engage with other countries, which was of great significance in opening up China's diplomatic situation and enhancing China's international prestige.
1:23:1|1:23:7|During the seven-day conference, in addition to attending meetings of all sizes, [Zhou Enlai] extensively socialized with leaders from various Asian and African countries.
1:23:7|1:23:23|According to the recollection of Cheng Yungong, the chief guard who followed Zhou Enlai back then, Zhou Enlai continuously attended a series of luncheons, dinners, and diplomatic talks, sleeping only 13 hours in total over seven days. In the end, he successfully established diplomatic relations and achieved friendly cooperation with many countries.
1:23:23|1:23:48|During the Asian-African Conference, although different voices could be heard, everyone was able to understand each other, cooperate actively, and finally achieve complete consensus. The twenty-nine participating countries jointly formulated ten principles on peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between nations, which were included in the conference's joint communique.
1:23:48|1:24:11|The content includes all the five principles of peaceful coexistence advocated by countries such as China and India. Nearly half a century has passed, and there have been significant changes in the global situation and the relationships between various countries and China. China has established diplomatic relations with 165 countries.
1:24:11|1:24:21|China has adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and an independent foreign policy, making remarkable contributions to world peace.
1:24:22|1:24:34|The scene shows the scenery of the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, with the glazed tile roofs shining brightly in the sunlight, exuding a dignified atmosphere, making people feel a sense of national peace and prosperity.
