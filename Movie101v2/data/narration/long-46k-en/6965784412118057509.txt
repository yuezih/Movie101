0:2:10|0:2:20|The forensic photographer nodded, a forensic expert guided another person to take photos, a forensic expert was making notes, and another one was collecting footprints with tools. The police continued to pay attention to any overlooked clues by the river, while [Qian Guixing] who had been standing nearby walked away covering his mouth and nose.
0:2:32|0:2:49|[Qian Guixing] led the way, followed by the [forensic doctor] and [Police Liu] leaving the crime scene. Two police cars and three motorcycles were parked on the road next to the crime scene. [Police Liu] asked [Qian Guixing]: After thinking for a moment, the police said the name Lan Jie, and the police's words to the onlookers could be heard from the road.
0:2:54|0:3:14|The road slopes down, the calm river water is still flowing, and on the ground lies a pair of black gloves. Through the bridge tunnel, the working forensic can be seen. The title of the film is "The Pursuer". The first chapter is "Simpleton", where Song Lao'er is repairing a car under the vehicle, chatting with a friend in a jacket.
0:3:25|0:3:50|[Song Tao] handed over the wrench, the vibration in the pocket of his coat went unnoticed. Under the car, [Song Lao'er] spat out a mouthful of phlegm and stopped his work to say:
0:4:7|0:4:9|Passing the tool to [Song Tao], [Song Lao'er] tried to do the carp stand, but he couldn't get up.
0:4:25|0:4:30|[Song Lao'er] glanced elsewhere, and [Qian Guixing] finally rode up to [Song Lao'er]. He stopped the motorcycle.
0:4:56|0:5:5|[Song Tao] quickly crawled under the car, [Song Lao'er] threw his sleeves and gloves, [Qian Guixing] echoed repeatedly: "Let's go." With that, [Qian Guixing] hurried towards the motorcycle, followed by [Song Lao'er].
0:5:7|0:5:14|[Song Lao'er] sat in the back seat of [Qian Guixing]'s car, watching as the two friends slowly drove away. He turned around, deep in thought, reflecting on their conversation just now.
0:5:20|0:5:29|[Song Tao] skillfully tightened the screws without answering. The scene shifted to the police station, where Lan stared at [Song Lao'er], who then turned to look at the crying Lan.
0:5:29|0:5:47|Police Liu across the street looked him up and down. Song Lao'er glanced around and looked at Police Liu in front of him, blinking a few times. The police officer across the street spoke up and asked. Song Lao'er crossed his hands, answered cautiously, and raised his eyebrows slightly.
0:6:35|0:6:52|Lan pointed at [Song Lao'er] and cried, while Police Liu looked at the two of them. [Song Lao'er] turned around to glance at Police Liu and another police officer, looking incredulous. His face twisted in a frown as he said to Lan,
0:7:41|0:7:56|[Song Lao'er] also overturned the table and sat at the door. Upon hearing the commotion, [Qian Guixing] quickly got up and walked into the courtyard. Many villagers outside the door also gathered to see what was happening. The scene then shifts to [Police Liu] opening the door to the detention room. [Song Lao'er] suddenly looked outside and [Police Liu] sighed.
0:8:52|0:9:10|[Song Lao'er] gazed ahead in contemplation. The scene shifted, a man in black riding a motorcycle following behind [Song Lao'er]'s car. Inside the car, [Song Lao'er] glanced at his displeased son. In the noodle shop, several old men were discussing the cause of Cat Brother's death.
0:9:59|0:10:13|The old man looked at the angry Song Tao with some surprise. Song Lao'er broke the silence inside and outside the door, but Song Tao didn't move. Song Lao'er gave his son a hard pat. The old men in the noodle shop glanced at each other. Song Lao'er looked at them and left with his son.
0:10:19|0:10:36|Grandpa pointed in the direction where the two people were leaving. Looking from the inside of the auto repair shop, [Song Lao'er], who was fixing a tire, gradually stopped his work and looked over. [Song Tao] was staring straight at [Qian Guixing] sitting on the motorcycle by the roadside, pursing his lips and squinting without moving. [Song Lao'er] walked over to take a look at [Qian Guixing], then slowly turned his head to look at his son. [Song Tao] angrily went back into the house.
0:10:36|0:10:45|[Song Lao'er] turned his head to look at him. Looking from [Song Lao'er]'s direction, the man in black who was leaning on the motorcycle uncomfortably sat up and put the cigarette in his mouth to smoke.
0:10:45|0:10:53|Separated by steps and a few steps, the two faced each other. The man in black on a motorcycle kept a certain distance, following behind [Song Lao'er]'s car.
0:10:59|0:11:5|Song Lao'er's car arrived in the wilderness.
0:11:14|0:11:22|In an abandoned train carriage, [Song Lao'er], [Dong Xiaofeng], [Wang Youquan], [Yang Shuhua], [Xiao Ping], [Qian Guixing], [Police Liu], and [He Qingyong] were smoking and analyzing the situation.
0:12:11|0:12:18|Underneath the car, Police Liu is fixing the car. Police Liu climbs out from under the car, followed by Song Lao'er to the back of the car.
0:12:40|0:12:45|Police Liu threw the tools to the police officer Xiao Chen, whose face was covered in oil stains.
0:12:54|0:13:2|[Song Lao'er] watched as [Police Liu] walked away with a hunched back, then glanced at the police officer Xiao Chen. Outside, it was pouring rain, and people took shelter under [Song Lao'er]'s shed.
0:13:2|0:13:13|In the house, [Song Lao'er] scratched his head in distress, with his hands crossed in front of his chest, huddled on the stool, frowning tightly, until the rain gradually stopped and the people seeking shelter from the rain gradually left.
0:13:13|0:13:34|[Song Lao'er] suddenly saw a familiar motorcycle in a car leaving outside, so he quickly ran out of his hideout to chase after it. [Song Lao'er] drove the car, with a man in black clothes riding a motorcycle behind him. Both of them drove into the desolate mountains. Suddenly, [Song Lao'er] stopped the car halfway, got off, and squatted in front of the car to check. As he turned his head, the man in black clothes quickly hid behind a hill.
0:13:34|0:13:46|[Song Lao'er] stood up with his knees and walked to the car to continue checking. As he stood up, the man in black hid again. [Song Lao'er] turned his back, reached into his pocket, and scattered a pile of nails on the ground.
0:13:46|0:13:55|The man in black watched as [Song Lao'er] got into the car, then carefully hid back behind the mountain next to the ditch. [Song Lao'er] drove away, raising a cloud of dust.
0:13:56|0:14:5|After driving a distance, the man in black on a motorcycle caught up, only to be knocked down by Song Lao'er's scattered nails and plunged into a ditch, screaming in agony.
0:14:5|0:14:26|[Song Lao'er] occasionally got off the car to check the tire tracks on the ground, tracking the marks of the motorcycle all the way, determined to find that motorcycle. Finally, under the sunlight, the car was parked at a corner. The old people and children at the village entrance looked at this unfamiliar vehicle parked in front of them, and arrived at Shizhong Village.
0:14:27|0:14:38|Several villagers sitting by the roadside saw [Song Lao'er] looking around, so they asked. As [Song Lao'er] walked around looking for traces of a motorcycle, he saw two people in the distance through the door frame who were not the ones he was looking for.
0:14:38|0:14:46|Along the village's small road, [Song Lao'er] continued to search from house to house, not missing any place within sight. Suddenly, his eyes lit up.
0:14:46|0:14:59|The expressions on their faces changed, staring fixedly at a spot below the slope, exhaling a big breath of white air. [Song Lao'er] used both hands and feet, carefully climbing up onto the roof of a mud house, trying hard to see more clearly.
0:14:59|0:15:7|[Song Lao'er] crouched on the roof of the tile house, looking forward along a parked motorcycle, and could see [Song Lao'er] crouching on the roof.
0:15:8|0:15:15|[Song Lao'er] came down from the roof and quickly found a haystack to hide behind, sitting on the ground with his back against the haystack, trying to calm his breathing.
0:15:16|0:15:24|He took two deep breaths, leaned over and looked down. From this height, he could see the movements of the villagers below, with every person on the road in full view.
0:15:25|0:15:32|[Song Lao'er] took out his phone and dialed a number, preparing to call for reinforcements.
0:15:47|0:16:4|[Police Liu] is taking down information from the suspect with his colleagues. [Police Liu] clicks his tongue and looks at Xiao Chen who is coming to report.
0:16:20|0:16:37|The suspect walked over obediently, and from the moving car, a group of workers riding motorcycles and shouting could be seen. The workers were holding weapons in their hands. [Police Liu] looked at the group of workers, then glanced at Xiao Chen who was driving. The police car that was originally behind the motorcycle group then accelerated.
0:16:37|0:16:51|Workers raised shovels and sticks, and a considerable number of motorcycles kicked up dust. The police car gradually drove to the front of the motorcycle team and honked to signal.
0:16:52|0:17:2|With his fellow workers, [He Qingyong] observed the police car through sunglasses. [Police Liu] also noticed the parallel [He Qingyong]. Frowning, [He Qingyong] and his fellow workers watched [Police Liu] as he spoke to Xiao Chen.
0:17:4|0:17:19|The police car stopped in front of the motorcycle team, and the leading motorcycles crashed into the police car, causing the team to stop. On the other side, [Song Lao'er] was gesturing with a stick, waiting for his brothers to come help. [Song Lao'er] swung hard, the stick broke, and then he continued to gesture, accidentally hitting his own leg.
0:17:30|0:17:45|[Song Lao'er] looked at the two people talking in the courtyard, moved down slightly, and turned around with a stick in hand. Seeing the people in the courtyard about to ride a motorcycle, [Song Lao'er] tightened the stick in his hand.
0:17:47|0:18:1|Running down the slope, the stick dragged on the ground making a sound. [Song Lao'er] jumped down to a lower path and quickly walked towards the person pushing the motorcycle.
0:18:13|0:18:22|[Song Lao'er] threw the stick out, and the blond man fell onto the firewood when jumping to the next level of the road. Just as the blond man was about to jump to the next level, [Song Lao'er] followed and extended a foot.
0:18:22|0:18:33|The blond man stumbled, causing [Song Lao'er] to fall to the ground as well. After getting up, he collided with the blond man who realized that the path ahead was a dead end and turned back, and the two of them ran desperately on the small path.
0:18:47|0:18:55|Both sides were panting heavily, with [Song Lao'er] anxiously trying to chase the man with blonde hair, but he was surrounded by villagers and couldn't chase him anymore.
0:19:15|0:19:27|In the struggle, a net was thrown over [Song Lao'er], and the villagers completely controlled [Song Lao'er]. The police car gradually drove into the entrance of Shizhuang Village, and the village chief signaled the police car to move forward.
0:19:30|0:19:37|The police car stopped next to [Song Lao'er]'s car, and through the window of [Song Lao'er]'s car, you could see him tied to a tree with villagers surrounding him.
0:19:42|0:19:48|The villagers explained to Police Liu, who noticed that next to him was Song Lao'er's car. Song Lao'er had a radish stuffed in his mouth, unable to speak, only able to hum.
0:19:59|0:20:7|Police Liu said to the village chief:
0:20:32|0:20:48|The village chief looked at the two police officers and pointed to the back, then entered the yard of [Wang Youquan]'s house. [Song Lao'er] observed from the gate, [Police Liu] walked out of the door, [Song Lao'er] quickly took a few steps back, [Police Liu] put on his hat, and the village chief followed behind him.
0:21:9|0:21:24|[Song Lao'er] pointed to the sticker on the motorcycle for [Police Liu] to see. [Police Liu] kicked the motorcycle stand against the pillar, and Xiao Chen handed over a photo. [Song Lao'er] quickly leaned in, then quickly pulled back. [Police Liu] flipped the photo over, revealing a message saying "Yang Shuhua's 20th birthday celebration," with a photo of [Wang Youquan] and [Yang Shuhua] on the other side.
0:21:34|0:21:40|The village chief asked the villagers, and the village chief looked as Police Liu pointed in the direction of the field.
0:21:51|0:21:58|At the entrance of the village, [He Qingyong] arrived with his fellow workers. Following the shouting, everyone looked towards the motorcycle team, with [He Qingyong] in the front, slowly stopping the bike.
0:22:2|0:22:9|Upon seeing his belated brother, [Song Lao'er] turned his back towards the police car. [Police Liu] went up to check the convoy, then glanced at [Song Lao'er].
0:22:9|0:22:21|[Song Lao'er] didn't dare to meet his gaze, quickly turned his head. [Police Liu] naturally understood what was going on, he patted [He Qingyong] and asked. [He Qingyong] nodded with a smile, then thought for a moment and shook his head.
0:22:22|0:22:29|Police Liu immediately dropped his mouth and came to He Qingyong's yard, where a group of brothers were having a good time, with women picking vegetables and serving dishes.
0:22:33|0:22:39|Two people clenched their fists, [Song Lao'er] sat at another table eating, and his good buddy [He Qingyong] sat down and patted his arm, saying,
0:22:48|0:22:55|[Song Lao'er] finished his drink and [He Qingyong] pointed at him, saying,
0:24:11|0:24:30|[Qian Guixing] has already gotten on the motorcycle, [Song Lao'er] exclaimed: "It's already daytime." [Song Lao'er] is tidying up the car, [He Qingyong] is coming over with his colleague Xiao Jun, [Song Lao'er] is throwing away the waste bags on the car, took a glance at the newcomers, and continued unloading things.
0:24:37|0:24:52|[He Qingyong] sat in the passenger seat, Xiao Jun found a place to sit in the back of the car, [Song Lao'er] started the car, [He Qingyong]'s motorcycle was left directly at the repair shop entrance. Only [Song Lao'er] knew where they were going.
0:25:19|0:25:27|He Qingyong still jumped into the pigsty to help, Xiao Jun opened the pigsty door to help as well, Wang Youquan's mother hit Xiao Jun's helmet, and the pigs were struggling hard.
0:25:36|0:25:42|Two women rushed over upon hearing the noise, one pulling Wang Youquan's mother and the other dragging Song Lao'er, but it was of no avail.
0:25:42|0:25:52|In the car, [He Qingyong] looked at [Song Lao'er], not sure if it took a lot of effort to pull the pig or to calm down his anger. [Song Lao'er] took a deep breath, while Xiao Jun was still sweating and pulling the pig at the back of the car. Suddenly, [He Qingyong] spoke up:
0:26:1|0:26:6|[Song Lao'er] stepped on the brake, both of them leaned forward, [He Qingyong] opened the car door and got out, then he forcefully closed the door and said to Xiao Jun:
0:26:11|0:26:35|After saying goodbye to [He Qingyong], they walked forward. Xiao Jun glanced at Song Lao'er in the car, not understanding what was going on. Song Lao'er looked at the two of them, hands on the steering wheel, frowning. He puffed his cheeks twice, took a deep breath, started the car, caught up with the two who had not walked far, and asked, "He Xin Yong, without even looking at Song Lao'er, Song Lao'er pursed his lips, turned around, and repeated:
0:26:37|0:26:40|[He Qingyong] finally glanced at [Song Lao'er], but still didn't say anything.
0:26:42|0:26:55|[Song Lao'er] stepped on the gas pedal, glanced back, and soon left the two behind in the desolate mountain valley. The clouds swiftly drifted by, [Song Lao'er]'s car getting farther and farther away from the two pedestrians. [Song Lao'er] nodded to the boss as he took the money from selling pigs and counted it as he walked.
0:27:8|0:27:24|He walked while entangling the pig-catching net, then tucked the net under his arm. In the narrow alley with many pedestrians and constant car horns, [Song Lao'er] was busy, his steps slightly heavy. [Song Lao'er] turned into a downhill road and continued walking.
0:27:24|0:27:33|It feels like someone is following me. [Song Lao'er] turned his head while walking, but found no suspicious person. He walked a few more steps.
0:27:33|0:27:47|He leaned in slightly, with villagers carrying firewood behind him, people standing at their doorsteps, and a yellow dog of unknown origin. [Song Lao'er] continued walking, occasionally looking back to see if anyone was following him.
0:27:48|0:28:3|After passing a T-junction, [Song Lao'er] turned back again, only to see an old man carrying straw and leading a cow, along with a few villagers. [Song Lao'er] turned back abruptly once more, and there was still only the old man with the cow. [Song Lao'er] blinked his eyes.
0:28:4|0:28:21|The camera moves behind the straw, and from this angle, we can see [Song Lao'er]. [Song Lao'er] walks onto a narrow path, first tilting his face slightly to the side, then suddenly turning around. He stops in place, using his eyes to search, but there is still no one around.
0:28:22|0:28:44|He could only turn around and continue walking. After a few steps, he suddenly turned back, so abruptly that he almost lost his balance. He reached out to steady himself against the stone wall beside him. [Song Lao'er] had only taken a few steps when a cell phone rang. Startled, he turned around again, this time walking towards the direction of the ringing phone.
0:28:45|0:29:2|With eyes wide open, slightly parted lips, and neck leaning forward, [Song Lao'er] looked towards the door where the bell sound came from, but the door was closed, with only two door-god paintings and an unlocked door lock swaying in the wind. [Song Lao'er] cautiously approached the door, squinted and looked inside, and not finding anyone, [Song Lao'er] continued walking forward.
0:29:2|0:29:10|Holding a pig-catching net in hand, [Song Lao'er] walked while keeping an eye on the rear. Finally, he saw his car parked at the intersection, lowered his head, and relaxed a bit.
0:29:11|0:29:21|He couldn't figure it out, so he walked towards the car parked in the sunlight. The car was parked at the intersection between the field and the village, next to a neatly stacked straw pile. Before he reached the car,
0:29:21|0:29:32|[Song Lao'er] threw the pig-catching net up, then walked a few steps to the car door, took out the key from his pocket, suddenly a hand appeared behind [Song Lao'er] and patted him on the back, which startled [Song Lao'er].
0:29:39|0:29:53|[Song Lao'er] looked him up and down, furrowed his brow and took a breath, Maodou grinned with his mouth open, waiting for [Song Lao'er] to respond. Finally, [Song Lao'er] said:
0:29:58|0:30:3|[Song Lao'er] took another look at Mao Dou, squinting his eyes. Mao Dou licked his lips and glanced sideways.
0:30:9|0:30:14|Song Lao'er's pupils dilated slightly as he looked at Maodou with his head tilted. Turning to Cat Brother's house, a Taoist priest was performing a ritual.
0:30:52|0:30:58|[Song Lao'er] entered the door while taking out the money for selling pigs from his pocket, accidentally spilling it on the ground.
0:31:5|0:31:17|[Song Lao'er] turned and walked away. On the road to and from the county town, a large truck quickly passed by, in contradiction to [Song Lao'er]'s car, passing through the sparse trees by the road, gradually moving away from the village.
0:31:17|0:31:40|On the rooftop, [Song Lao'er] watched as [Wang Youquan]'s girlfriend [Yang Shuhua] hung up the laundry. [Yang Shuhua] sniffed, wiped her eyes, then wiped her whole face with the back of her hand. She glanced at [Song Lao'er] and said, tossing a crumpled paper ball at him. [Song Lao'er] tripped over the loose clothesline, then unfolded the crumpled paper.
0:31:51|0:32:10|After speaking, [Yang Shuhua] continued to hang up the laundry. [Yang Shuhua] patted the sheets being aired, then bent down to pick up other items to hang. [Song Lao'er] blinked and turned his head. [Yang Shuhua] twisted the water towards [Song Lao'er], who quickly dodged his feet. [Yang Shuhua] raised her hand to hang up.
0:32:22|0:32:36|[Yang Shuhua] turned around to pat the pillowcase, [Song Lao'er], who was originally bending over, stood up straight and looked at [Yang Shuhua], moving his mouth but unable to say anything, so he chose to leave. [Yang Shuhua] watched [Song Lao'er] walk away from the corner of her eye, and breathed a sigh of relief.
0:32:36|0:32:41|[Song Lao'er] walked down the stairs, passing by two security guards who were moving a car. [Song Lao'er] walked quickly, breathing heavily with each step.
0:32:43|0:32:50|As he just came down from the rooftop, a large rock fell down, and [Song Lao'er] was walking right underneath where the rock fell.
0:33:36|0:33:53|[Yang Shuhua] looked at [Wang Youquan] with a sidelong glance, her hands gripping his shoulders as she leaned against him. The two of them skated from the winding mountain road to the roller skating rink. [Wang Youquan] held [Yang Shuhua]'s hand as they glided on the roller skates.
0:33:54|0:34:1|[Wang Youquan] deliberately tripped, causing both of them to fall to the ground. [Yang Shuhua] sat on a chair, nibbling her nails to rest. [Wang Youquan] called out to her:
0:34:5|0:34:21|[Yang Shuhua] sat on the chair, laughing happily, she shook her legs and looked around. On the rooftop late at night, [Yang Shuhua] wearing slippers, a military coat, holding a blanket, crossed over the iron frame on the rooftop. Under the military coat, she had already changed into pajama shorts.
0:34:23|0:34:32|[Yang Shuhua], petite in stature, walked with a large blanket in her arms and turned the corner of the wall, where she saw [Wang Youquan] pulling a mattress outside.
0:34:33|0:34:39|He squeezed through the iron wires and arrived behind [Wang Youquan], then kicked him in the butt.
0:35:7|0:35:22|[Yang Shuhua] was pulled into the arms by [Wang Youquan], who then kissed her fiercely. While kissing, [Wang Youquan] also took off [Yang Shuhua]'s military coat. [Yang Shuhua] stopped resisting and hugged [Wang Youquan]'s neck. [Wang Youquan] kissed [Yang Shuhua] a few more times, looking at her.
0:35:39|0:35:52|[Yang Shuhua] touched her boyfriend's face, looking at him with concern. In the daytime, [Wang Youquan] rode a motorcycle on the road, swaying and looking ahead, riding back to the village from the county town. The dense residential buildings of the county town were getting farther and farther behind, and it started to rain heavily.
0:35:53|0:36:8|[Wang Youquan] parked the car on the side, quickly put down the car support, pressed the key on the front of the car and held it in his hand, covered his head with his hand, and hid under the shed of [Song Lao'er]'s repair shop. It was the day when [Song Lao'er] was sitting in the shop daydreaming, gradually, people walked out of the shed.
0:36:9|0:36:24|[Wang Youquan] looked at the people around him, then glanced at the rain, reaching out to feel how heavy it was. [Wang Youquan] pushed the motorcycle to turn around, getting ready to leave. He started the motorcycle, and at that moment, [Song Lao'er] noticed the familiar motorcycle rushing out of the house and quickly ran to drive it.
0:36:33|0:36:39|Wang Youquan, riding a motorcycle, returned home while talking on the phone. He carried a bucket of slops and walked into the yard.
0:36:46|0:37:10|After hanging up the phone, [Wang Youquan] put the leftover radish in his mouth, held the front and back of the motorcycle with one hand each, turned the motorcycle around, pushed it out of the door with the radish in his mouth. He saw [Song Lao'er] coming down from a high place. He got on the motorcycle and tried to start it, while [Song Lao'er] was behind him, carrying a stick and shouting that the motorcycle wouldn't start. [Wang Youquan] leaned the motorcycle against a utility pole and took off the radish mixed with saliva.
0:37:14|0:37:37|[Wang Youquan] ran desperately, while the village chief and his men stopped [Song Lao'er]. [Wang Youquan] kept running hard, checking if [Song Lao'er] was following. He spotted a small path on the side of the road, quickly stopped running, and dove into a pile of grass in someone's yard. As he lay on the grass, he heard a noise.
0:38:11|0:38:31|[Song Lao'er] and Police Liu walked away, leaving [Wang Youquan] sitting on a pile of grass, looking in the direction of the bird's chirping, lost in thought. As [Wang Youquan] walked on the road, he brushed off the sticky weeds on his body. Behind him was a small three-wheeled cart carrying firewood. As [Wang Youquan] jumped to shake off the weeds on his body, the cart came close to him. He almost got knocked down by the firewood sticking out of the cart, quickly blocking his head and turning around.
0:38:31|0:38:46|Then he ran a few steps and climbed onto this tricycle, sitting skillfully at the back of the tricycle. [Wang Youquan] then arrived in the county town to find [Yang Shuhua], passing by two girls in work clothes, one limping. When he reached the middle of two cars, he collided head-on with someone.
0:38:47|0:38:54|[Wang Youquan] angrily said a sentence, the person was hit on the nose, covering his nose and turning to look at [Wang Youquan], [Wang Youquan] touched the face that was hit, took a step up several steps and walked upstairs.
0:39:0|0:39:8|[Wang Youquan] pulled the railing net and looked around. When he heard the sound of water from the water room, he walked over. [Wang Youquan] immediately bounced up when he stepped on the water, and he crossed over the puddle to turn off the faucet. [Yang Shuhua] glanced at [Wang Youquan].
0:39:30|0:39:37|[Wang Youquan] turned on the tap to wash his face, splashed it twice, then glanced at [Yang Shuhua], splashed it again, and looked at her once more.
0:39:38|0:39:45|[Yang Shuhua] was rubbing the clothes, and [Wang Youquan] leaned in to take a closer look, tears still visible on [Yang Shuhua]'s face.
0:40:0|0:40:18|[Wang Youquan] moved his eyes up and down, not daring to move. [Yang Shuhua] sniffed and looked [Wang Youquan] up and down. [Wang Youquan] avoided eye contact, wiped the water off his face. [Yang Shuhua] looked at him, took a deep breath, cleared her nose, and finally spoke: [Wang Youquan] moved his mouth slightly, and what he finally said was,
0:40:24|0:40:37|[Yang Shuhua] looked at him, [Wang Youquan] cautiously raised his eyes to look at [Yang Shuhua], [Yang Shuhua] trembled slightly and opened her mouth, but didn't say anything, a tear fell down first.
0:40:45|0:40:55|[Yang Shuhua] shook her hand. At the station, [Wang Youquan] took out a few 100 yuan bills and handed them to the ticket seller. [Yang Shuhua] waited behind him, while [Wang Youquan] leaned on the railing, watching the ticket seller issue the tickets. He licked his lips, then turned to glance at [Yang Shuhua].
0:40:55|0:41:4|[Yang Shuhua] also looked at him and smiled. [Wang Youquan] responded with a smile, turned his head to face the ticket seller, and bought the tickets. After buying the tickets, [Wang Youquan] hugged [Yang Shuhua] while looking at his phone, and [Yang Shuhua] suddenly stopped.
0:41:6|0:41:17|[Wang Youquan] looked at [Yang Shuhua] who suddenly stopped, then glanced at the car. [Yang Shuhua] looked up at [Wang Youquan], forced a smile, and then lowered her head. [Wang Youquan] looked at the car again, licked his lips, and turned his head.
0:41:17|0:41:29|Looking at [Yang Shuhua] with a strange expression, [Yang Shuhua] asked, looking to the side, her head lowered even more. [Wang Youquan] glanced at [Yang Shuhua] as if wanting to speak, but [Yang Shuhua] remained silent with her head down.
0:41:29|0:41:48|[Wang Youquan] turned his head to look at the car again, [Yang Shuhua] lifted her head and flicked her hair, staring at [Wang Youquan]. Their eyes met, and [Yang Shuhua] blinked, taking a step forward and asking. She trembled slightly, mouth open but no words came out.
0:41:58|0:42:5|[Yang Shuhua] fiddled with her hair, wiped away her tears with her hand. [Wang Youquan] pursed his lips, his eyes wandering up and down, raised his hand and rubbed [Yang Shuhua]'s shoulder, [Yang Shuhua] took a deep breath.
0:42:25|0:42:33|[Wang Youquan] approached [Yang Shuhua] and hugged her.
0:42:34|0:42:41|[Yang Shuhua] lowered her head, bit her lower lip, tears welling up in her eyes, then quickly raised her head and looked around.
0:42:50|0:43:8|[Yang Shuhua] nodded with her lower lip bitten. [Wang Youquan] stuffed the ticket into his back pocket and hurried towards the bus. Tears streamed down [Yang Shuhua]'s face, her lip trembling uncontrollably. Finally, she watched him board the bus as [Wang Youquan] walked away.
0:43:27|0:43:33|[Wang Youquan] sat in the car, talking on the phone with [Yang Shuhua].
0:43:45|0:43:51|[Wang Youquan] lowered his voice and asked:
0:44:22|0:44:35|[Wang Youquan] hung up the phone, glanced at the person next to him, and walked towards the front of the bus. The bus from Shuicheng to Kunming had stopped by the roadside. By the time he turned around, [Wang Youquan] was already eating noodles at a roadside stall. [Yang Shuhua] sat next to him, dialing [Song Lao'er]'s phone number.
0:44:36|0:44:43|[Wang Youquan] took a big bite of noodles and asked while eating:
0:45:31|0:45:38|[Wang Youquan] took another big bite of noodles.
0:46:1|0:46:10|[Wang Youquan] bit off a piece of bread, ate a potato chip, chewed it loudly, and walked to the roller skating rink. [Song Lao'er] sat on a chair, [Wang Youquan] stood up, and [Song Lao'er] turned slightly towards [Wang Youquan].
0:47:20|0:47:34|[Wang Youquan] jumped over with his hands on the crossbar, while [Song Lao'er] kept his mouth shut and lowered his head. Unexpectedly, when [Wang Youquan] had already reached the door, he turned back. [Song Lao'er] quickly lifted his head, and after thinking for a moment, [Wang Youquan] crawled back under the crossbar.
0:47:34|0:47:40|He put both hands in his pockets and walked over, saying, "[Song Lao'er]" blinked a few times.
0:47:41|0:47:55|In the desolate mountains, [Song Lao'er] returned the money from the pig robbery to [Wang Youquan]. [Wang Youquan] sat on a rock, joyfully counting the money. [Song Lao'er] searched for evidence among the abandoned items, while [Wang Youquan] held the money and reminded [Song Lao'er]. [Song Lao'er] turned around, and [Wang Youquan] pointed to a plastic bag nearby.
0:47:55|0:48:3|[Song Lao'er] bent down to pick it up and wrapped it around his own hands, wrapping it a few times. [Wang Youquan] counted the money again, while [Song Lao'er] carefully searched through it.
0:48:3|0:48:18|[Wang Youquan] lifted the money up to the sky for confirmation, [Song Lao'er] took out a bunch of keys from a pocket of a white suit, identifying the English on them. [Wang Youquan] also looked at the keys upon hearing the sound, and [Song Lao'er] looked at [Wang Youquan].
0:48:26|0:48:37|[Wang Youquan] moistened his fingers with saliva, [Song Lao'er] continued to search. [Song Lao'er] carefully opened the white suit, felt something in the pocket, and tried to take it out. When he took it out, he saw a bank passbook and several pieces of paper.
0:48:37|0:48:45|[Song Lao'er] turned over another page to confirm, separated a few things, while [Wang Youquan] was happily counting money. [Song Lao'er] used his right hand covered with a plastic bag to flip open the passbook and read out the information on it.
0:49:5|0:49:20|[Song Lao'er] gathered the things he found together, looked around on the ground, and interrupted [Wang Youquan] who was counting money.
0:49:28|0:49:45|[Wang Youquan] impatiently glanced at [Song Lao'er]. On the rocky hillside, [Song Lao'er] dug through a pile of things, [Wang Youquan] leaned over, and [Song Lao'er] pulled out a photo. [Wang Youquan] shifted his body, accidentally flipping over a rock. [Song Lao'er] stared blankly at the photo in his hand.
0:49:45|0:49:54|Without blinking, [Wang Youquan] got up, opened his mouth and endured the pain to look over. The photo in [Song Lao'er]'s hand turned out to be a blurry image of [Song Lao'er] himself. The third title appeared.
0:49:56|0:50:7|The mixed-breed, the scene shifts, a wallet with a photo of [Song Lao'er] on it, a few drops of water sprinkled on the photo. As the camera pans out and then in, it turns out to be [Dong Xiaofeng] struggling to do push-ups.
0:50:7|0:50:23|In between two narrow dormitory beds, [Dong Xiaofeng] in a shirt and trousers, with dumbbells in front of him and a security guard watching the nightclub's surveillance on the left. [Dong Xiaofeng]'s face was covered in sweat, with a determined look on his face as he struggled to do another one.
0:50:24|0:50:32|[Dong Xiaofeng] couldn't hold on, one hand let go, and the whole person fell to the ground.
0:50:38|0:50:51|Wearing glasses, [Dong Xiaofeng] arrived at the nightclub. After greeting his colleagues, he whistled and casually took the fruit from the tray his colleague was holding. [Dong Xiaofeng] pushed the door open and a woman walked into the restroom while talking on the phone, the room was filled with women. Someone spotted [Dong Xiaofeng] and shouted,
0:50:53|0:51:4|[Xiao Ping] stuffed some food in her mouth, then squeezed past the sisters and walked over. As she walked, she clapped her hands. When [Dong Xiaofeng] saw [Xiao Ping], she walked towards the door. [Xiao Ping] quickly caught up and followed her. After going out the door and looking outside, the two of them arrived at another private room.
0:51:5|0:51:11|[Xiao Ping] greeted [Dong Xiaofeng] to come in, [Dong Xiaofeng] closed the door, and [Xiao Ping] took off her coat.
0:51:31|0:51:59|[Xiao Ping] looked at [Dong Xiaofeng] curiously. [Dong Xiaofeng] moved her neck, and suddenly [Xiao Ping] stood up straight. [Xiao Ping] covered her mouth in surprise, then shook [Dong Xiaofeng] and said, [Xiao Ping] pursed her lips, gazed affectionately at [Dong Xiaofeng], and then rushed forward to kiss him.
0:51:59|0:52:8|[Dong Xiaofeng] hurried to leave, using her hands to hold [Xiao Ping]'s face, preventing her from getting closer. [Dong Xiaofeng] then raised [Xiao Ping]'s low collar a bit as she spoke.
0:52:18|0:52:41|During the day, a red truck slowly approached as [Dong Xiaofeng] walked in the same direction. The truck gradually pulled over to the side of the road. The sound of the slowly moving truck mixed with the noise of a motorcycle. Cat Brother rode his motorcycle to [Song Lao'er]'s shop for repairs, but no one responded.
0:52:57|0:53:12|Cat Brother looked around, then walked out from the side door next to the main entrance. He glanced at the black gloves on his hand and walked to the storage rack in the garage to take a look. At this moment, wearing white trousers and sunglasses, [Cat Brother] was in the garage.
0:53:12|0:53:33|Dong Xiaofeng, in a white suit, looked at the big truck behind him, walked towards the repair shop. He took two slow steps and stopped, then picked up the suit sleeve on his wrist. He took out a photo from his pocket, switched hands to hold the photo, and flipped up the lens of his sunglasses with the other hand. Looking at the photo in his hand, he raised it from left to right to chest level, half a meter away, and glanced at the repair shop again.
0:53:33|0:53:40|Continuing to walk with her head held high, a large truck passed by next to her, followed by a white van. [Dong Xiaofeng] walked while putting the photo back into her pocket.
0:53:41|0:53:54|At this moment, Cat Brother had already taken tools to fix the motorcycle by himself. [Dong Xiaofeng] watched as Cat Brother approached, glanced around, and then looked inside the repair shop. [Dong Xiaofeng] walked up behind Cat Brother, lowered her eyes to watch him, and picked up the collar of her white suit.
0:54:2|0:54:17|Turning around to look at the road, Song Lao'er straightened up and looked back at Dong Xiaofeng, who was still fixing the car. Putting on a white suit, he then ran his hand along his leg and checked his pocket, but found nothing inside.
0:54:17|0:54:34|[Dong Xiaofeng] pursed her lips and tilted her body to size up [Cat Brother], then took two small steps forward. Next, she moved closer to [Cat Brother] and propped her leg with one hand, bending her body to observe him. [Dong Xiaofeng] bent down even closer, startling [Cat Brother] who was crouching on the ground.
0:54:43|0:54:53|[Dong Xiaofeng] stood up straight, straightened his white suit on the street. After adjusting the collar of his suit, [Cat Brother] didn't stop his hands and glanced at [Dong Xiaofeng].
0:55:4|0:55:10|[Cat Brother] stopped what he was doing and looked at the road, asking:
0:55:21|0:55:33|[Cat Brother] stood up and tried to start the motorcycle, the black exhaust dirtied [Dong Xiaofeng]'s trousers. [Dong Xiaofeng] looked down and was shocked, while [Cat Brother] laughed and turned off the motorcycle. [Dong Xiaofeng] looked up with her mouth wide open.
0:55:40|0:55:46|[Dong Xiaofeng] lifted her leg to look at her pants, while [Cat Brother] picked up the black gloves placed beside him and put them on.
0:56:7|0:56:27|In the desolate mountains, [Song Lao'er] rode a motorcycle with [Dong Xiaofeng], stopping at the Washing Line Ditch. As [Dong Xiaofeng] got off, a dagger fell to the ground. She looked down, took a step back, picked up the dagger, and lightly tossed it up, catching it by the blade. [Song Lao'er] nervously watched as [Dong Xiaofeng] touched the blade.
0:56:33|0:56:40|[Song Lao'er] glanced at [Dong Xiaofeng], took the dagger and examined it in his hand. The reflection of the dagger shone on [Song Lao'er]'s face as he handed it to [Dong Xiaofeng].
0:56:43|0:56:50|[Dong Xiaofeng] smiled as she took the dagger, lifted her suit and stuffed it into her belt. She looked down and saw the oil stains on her pants, then took off the suit.
0:56:51|0:57:0|Adjusted and placed it on the motorcycle. After getting off the car, [Song Lao'er] saw,
0:57:2|0:57:8|[Song Lao'er] glanced at the motorcycle and looked around, catching up with [Dong Xiaofeng] who was already going downhill. [Song Lao'er] picked up his pants while going downhill.
0:57:16|0:57:29|[Song Lao'er] turned to look at [Dong Xiaofeng], who paused and asked, "Once you're done?" After [Song Lao'er] finished speaking, he chuckled at [Dong Xiaofeng], but she didn't laugh; instead, she spat.
0:57:51|0:58:1|[Dong Xiaofeng] pulled up the zipper, gesturing with both hands a length of half a meter, while [Song Lao'er]'s hand holding the cigarette was shaking slightly.
0:58:17|0:58:24|[Dong Xiaofeng] also leaned in and asked, [Song Lao'er]’s face changed, tremblingly smiled, turned around and said,
0:58:26|0:58:40|[Dong Xiaofeng] immediately pulled out a dagger and stabbed towards the back of [Song Lao'er]. Not satisfied with one stab, she followed up with another. Through the bridge tunnel, [Song Lao'er] could be seen weakly raising one hand to touch his back. After [Dong Xiaofeng] pulled out the knife and stepped back, [Song Lao'er] could only fall backwards. Shocked, he watched as his hand, pulled back from behind, was covered in bright red blood.
0:58:50|0:58:59|[Song Lao'er] lunged at [Dong Xiaofeng], who dodged. [Song Lao'er] ran while holding his back and looking back, as [Dong Xiaofeng] caught up and struck at [Song Lao'er]'s head with a dagger, knocking him to the ground.
0:58:59|0:59:9|[Dong Xiaofeng] quickly looked around to see if there was anyone on the road, then followed [Song Lao'er], who could no longer run, and kicked him from behind. [Song Lao'er] fell to the ground, blood from his back splattered on the weeds.
0:59:9|0:59:24|[Song Lao'er] tried to get up and run, but [Dong Xiaofeng] kicked him again. [Song Lao'er] almost coughed up blood as he crawled forward. [Dong Xiaofeng] stabbed the dagger into the ground in front of [Song Lao'er].
0:59:45|1:0:8|[Dong Xiaofeng] placed her hand on Cat Brother's scapula, pressed down hard, stood up with a dagger in hand, and asked Xiao Xi, then turned her head, lightly tossed the knife towards Cat Brother, straddled his back, and then stabbed him hard with the dagger, the blood on the dagger deepened, raised both hands over her head and stabbed at the same spot, Cat Brother groaned.
1:0:8|1:0:21|[Dong Xiaofeng] also made another cut, and Cat Brother's hands, covered in weeds, opened up. [Dong Xiaofeng] was panting, blood continuously sliding down the blade. She stood up from Cat Brother's back, and Cat Brother's hands stopped struggling.
1:0:24|1:0:32|[Dong Xiaofeng] threw away the dagger held between her tiger's mouth and thumb, looked at her hand, then at her pants, took out her phone from the pocket, but failed to grab any and ended up throwing the phone away.
1:0:32|1:0:45|Hastily took two steps forward to pick up the phone, took a photo of Cat Brother from the front, then took another one from the right side, and skipped over Cat Brother to take another one from his left side. Quickly put away the phone, looked around to see if anyone was nearby, made sure no one was there, then flipped Cat Brother over from his right side.
1:0:45|1:1:5|Cat Brother's face was covered in blood and grass, [Dong Xiaofeng] knelt on the ground, looking at Cat Brother's face, and felt the pockets on his body. There was still snow in the mountain valley, [Dong Xiaofeng] searched for the dead person under the hot sun, and finally took out a phone and wallet from Cat Brother's pocket. She held the phone in her mouth, picked up the discarded dagger next to her, spat out the phone from her mouth, and walked to the west, dropping the dagger first.
1:1:5|1:1:18|Threw the phone in again, rummaged through the wallet, took out the money and stuffed it into his pocket, then threw the wallet into the stream. He picked up the dagger on the ground, took two steps forward, almost slipped, then stepped back, leaning towards the stream, and used the water to clean the dagger.
1:1:34|1:1:45|Hiding behind the stone where the dagger was thrown, [Dong Xiaofeng] panted and adjusted her sunglasses with her hand, secretly observing. [Dong Xiaofeng] cautiously peeked out and saw someone in the distance walking onto the road. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be [Wang Youquan], standing on the road looking around.
1:1:45|1:1:58|[Song Lao'er] noticed that [Wang Youquan] was not paying attention to himself. [Dong Xiaofeng] sighed as she leaned against a rock. She saw [Wang Youquan] slowly walking towards the motorcycle, touching his head, and putting on a hat while glancing back. [Dong Xiaofeng] tilted her head, paying close attention.
1:1:58|1:2:20|[Wang Youquan] walked to the motorcycle and whistled, then looked around to see if anyone was nearby. He quickly moved towards the motorcycle, grabbed the handle, and swiftly mounted it. [Dong Xiaofeng] put both hands on the rock and exclaimed in surprise. [Wang Youquan] started the motorcycle, and it began to move.
1:2:21|1:2:26|[Wang Youquan] took a glance, then quickly rode away on his motorcycle, while [Dong Xiaofeng] was still crawling up the small slope beside the road.
1:2:28|1:2:34|[Wang Youquan] is riding away on a motorcycle. [Dong Xiaofeng] is hoarse as she shouts and stomps her feet in place.
1:2:38|1:2:42|Heading towards [Wang Youquan] and cursing. [Dong Xiaofeng] wearing an old cotton coat, arrived at the tea house.
1:2:43|1:2:59|Walking while brushing off the dust on his body, Song Lao'er took off his old cotton coat and threw it on the grass mat. He rolled up his shirt sleeves as he walked, tilting his head to look around, and headed towards a room with a half-open door. Dong Xiaofeng pushed the door open, and Qian Guixing, who was playing cards inside, turned his head. The other man playing cards also looked at Dong Xiaofeng.
1:2:59|1:3:7|[Qian Guixing] and the man in the middle gestured for Xiao Mei to go out for tea, then the three looked at [Dong Xiaofeng]. [Qian Guixing] put down his cards and stood up, walking over to look at [Dong Xiaofeng].
1:3:7|1:3:15|[Dong Xiaofeng] nodded slightly, reached into her pocket, [Qian Guixing] turned to look back, [Dong Xiaofeng] had already taken out her phone, and [Qian Guixing] also shifted his gaze to the phone.
1:3:16|1:3:31|[Dong Xiaofeng] took out a photo and handed it to [Qian Guixing], swiped on the phone a few times, all were photos of Cat Brother's body, then handed the phone back to [Dong Xiaofeng]. [Dong Xiaofeng] looked up at [Qian Guixing], the two locked eyes, [Qian Guixing] slightly turned his face, licked his lips and asked:
1:3:36|1:3:57|The man with his back turned around, looked at [Qian Guixing], who then turned his head. [Dong Xiaofeng] also looked at him. The man gestured, and the man who was still sitting stood up, holding a cloth bag and placing it on the mahjong table. [Dong Xiaofeng] walked to the table, gently opened the bag to reveal several stacks of hundred yuan bills. She closed the bag, lifted it up, spun it around, and was about to leave.
1:4:0|1:4:4|[Qian Guixing] covered his mouth and said. [Dong Xiaofeng] awkwardly retracted her outstretched hand, put it in her pocket, and then left.
1:4:4|1:4:21|[Dong Xiaofeng] quickly ran down the stairs after leaving the house, unbuttoning the buttons of her shirt as she went. With one hand holding an old cotton coat and the other carrying a cloth bag, she stuffed the bag into her shirt and draped the old cotton coat over herself. As she walked out of the alley, she glanced back, then pulled the coat over the bag in her arms and took a few steps forward, looking around.
1:4:51|1:4:54|[Dong Xiaofeng] smiled and watched as the young man started the car.
1:4:58|1:5:16|In a blink of an eye, [Dong Xiaofeng] has ridden a motorcycle to the road in the wilderness. The motorcycle passes by the ditch where he killed Cat Brother, and Cat Brother's body is still lying there, with pale lips, a face devoid of color, covered in bloodstains and weeds. [Dong Xiaofeng] drives through the swirling dust, standing up to see where he is heading.
1:5:16|1:5:32|Riding a motorcycle and gnawing on a sugarcane she got from somewhere, [Dong Xiaofeng] arrived at a fork in the road and stopped by kicking her foot. She looked both ways, chose one side to ride on, and entered the small path of Shizhao. Just as [Dong Xiaofeng] passed a T-junction,
1:5:32|1:5:49|[Wang Youquan] rode past on Cat Brother's motorcycle. [Dong Xiaofeng] stopped the bike, listening to the sound of the motorcycle. He slowly turned his head, rode back to the T-junction just now, stopped at the intersection, and looked in the direction of the motorcycle sound he heard.
1:5:49|1:6:3|Glancing over to the other side, under the gaze of the villagers sitting by the roadside, [Wang Youquan] rode his motorcycle to the door of his house. [Dong Xiaofeng] touched the cloth bag in her arms, flicked her upper lip, started the motorcycle, and headed in the opposite direction of [Wang Youquan]'s house. The sky was turning dark.
1:6:3|1:6:13|In the darkness, [Dong Xiaofeng] shook her head, adjusted her helmet, and pushed up her glasses. With the sky completely dark, [Dong Xiaofeng] continued to ride her motorcycle in search of the way.
1:6:13|1:6:25|During the day of the next day, [Dong Xiaofeng] rode a motorcycle past the Washing Line Ditch again. At this time, there were police cars parked on the road of the Washing Line Ditch, as well as some workers watching. [Dong Xiaofeng] directly drove past the scene of the incident.
1:6:27|1:6:35|[Dong Xiaofeng] returned to the nightclub, a woman called out to her, but [Dong Xiaofeng] ignored her and instead looked eagerly at each doorway.
1:6:38|1:6:47|The other woman in the aisle replied to him. [Dong Xiaofeng] paused for a moment and then quickly stepped forward, pushed open the door of the private room and walked in. However, once inside, [Dong Xiaofeng] froze as she saw [Xiao Ping] singing at the table with someone.
1:6:47|1:6:56|[Qian Guixing] sat on the sofa, [Dong Xiaofeng] watched as [Qian Guixing] picked up a glass of wine, [Xiao Ping] pushed away the man trying to sing, and got off the table.
1:7:5|1:7:14|[Xiao Ping] introduced. [Dong Xiaofeng] raised her arm and accidentally bumped into [Xiao Ping]'s nose, while [Qian Guixing] was staring at [Dong Xiaofeng]. [Xiao Ping] asked in confusion. [Dong Xiaofeng] lowered her head.
1:7:30|1:7:37|Boss Ma picked up the wallet on the table and opened it. [Xiao Ping] winked at [Dong Xiaofeng], who rolled her eyes and took a deep breath. [Xiao Ping] then directly took the money from Boss Ma's hand.
1:7:45|1:7:50|[Xiao Ping] smiled and tried to push [Dong Xiaofeng] away, but [Dong Xiaofeng] pushed back. [Qian Guixing] raised his glass and took a sip.
1:7:50|1:8:1|Xiao Ping's face has changed, Qian Guixing puts down the wine glass and looks at Dong Xiaofeng. Dong Xiaofeng's eyes are rapidly moving, Qian Guixing has stood up and walked towards Dong Xiaofeng. Dong Xiaofeng smirked, Qian Guixing slowly approached, and then kicked.
1:8:27|1:8:41|Qian Guixing pointed at [Dong Xiaofeng]. Qian Guixing turned around, before Dong Xiaofeng could react, Xiao Ping knelt on the ground, tremblingly looking at Dong Xiaofeng. Dong Xiaofeng gestured for her not to move, took a deep breath, and walked forward.
1:9:14|1:9:22|Qian Guixing swallowed and looked at Boss Ma, [Dong Xiaofeng] also followed to look at Boss Ma. Boss Ma tilted his head and rotated the Buddhist beads in his hand, [Dong Xiaofeng] then looked at Qian Guixing.
1:9:24|1:9:34|Qian Guixing raised his eyes slightly, and Dong Xiaofeng looked at Mr. Ma who was about to leave again. He took two steps back, picked up Xiao Ping's coat, and then pulled Xiao Ping, who was scared on the ground, up. Dong Xiaofeng held her and was about to leave.
1:9:34|1:9:47|At this moment, Boss Ma spoke up: [Dong Xiaofeng] and [Xiao Ping] both stood still, Qian Guixing wanted to gesture to them not to, but the boss tilted his head and smiled at him, [Dong Xiaofeng] didn't look back, thought for a moment and turned around.
1:9:50|1:9:58|[Ma Dongmei] holding a rosary said. He turned his head slightly to signal, and [Qian Guixing] looked at [Ma Dongmei] and lowered his head, putting his hands in his pockets and turning his body slightly.
1:9:59|1:10:20|After speaking, [Dong Xiaofeng] came over to pick up the cloth bag on the ground. [Xiao Ping] stood there blankly, then quickly turned around and ran to pick up the money that Mr. Ma had just given him. [Dong Xiaofeng] picked up the cloth bag and turned back to look at [Xiao Ping], then hurried over to pull her, nodding at Mr. Ma as they walked away. [Xiao Ping] nervously held the money and was pulled along in a small run. Qian Guixing slightly turned his body and then turned back, pondering with his head down. Back at [Dong Xiaofeng]'s house, [Xiao Ping] rushed over to kiss [Dong Xiaofeng]'s neck but was pushed away and slapped on the face.
1:10:24|1:10:28|[Dong Xiaofeng]'s mouth twitched. [Xiao Ping] stared at [Dong Xiaofeng] with wide eyes.
1:10:28|1:10:53|[Dong Xiaofeng] gasped and straightened out her shirt, while [Xiao Ping] continued to sit on the bed staring at [Dong Xiaofeng]. [Dong Xiaofeng] picked up the cloth bag on the small table, and said to [Xiao Ping], then threw the bag to her before turning away.
1:10:53|1:11:5|Picking up the things on the table, [Xiao Ping] turned her back, tears in her eyes and a frown on her face. On a rainy day outside the repair shop, [Dong Xiaofeng] and a few people seeking shelter from the rain huddled under the eaves of a small house next to the repair shop, constantly glancing at [Song Lao'er] inside the window.
1:11:5|1:11:14|The stolen car of the young man is still parked in the rain. [Dong Xiaofeng] sticks her head out and carefully observes, while [Song Lao'er] inside the car crosses his arms and stares at a spot without moving.
1:11:14|1:11:28|[Dong Xiaofeng]'s surveillance continues. She arrives at the mountain, [Song Lao'er] stops the car on the slope below, gets out to inspect. [Dong Xiaofeng] quickly brakes on the top, at the bend between the two, there is another person stopped there, circling around the earthen slope. [Dong Xiaofeng] can see parts of the car.
1:11:28|1:11:42|Walking towards the car is [Song Lao'er]. Seeing [Song Lao'er] in sight, [Dong Xiaofeng] quickly lowers her head. After a while, she raises her head again, only to find that [Song Lao'er] has already gotten into the car. [Dong Xiaofeng] glances ahead, making sure she is not noticed by [Song Lao'er], so she bends down several times.
1:11:42|1:11:59|[Song Lao'er] drove away from the puddle, and [Dong Xiaofeng] immediately started the car to follow. Looking back in the direction [Song Lao'er] left, they saw nails scattered on the ground. A motorcycle came over, its tire got punctured, and the person on the bike flipped into the puddle. Seeing this, [Dong Xiaofeng] used her foot to brake, but it was already too late.
1:11:59|1:12:14|He also tumbled into the water pit, falling down first. The man looked at [Dong Xiaofeng], who didn't care about the helmet falling off. She sat up and the man who fell down burst into laughter. The bewildered [Dong Xiaofeng] looked at the man. Time then came to the day when [He Qingyong] brought Xiao Jun to find [Song Lao'er].
1:12:14|1:12:28|[Dong Xiaofeng] squatted behind a scrapped car across from the auto repair shop, tapping a piece of cement in her hand repeatedly. On the other side, [He Qingyong] and Xiao Jun got into the front passenger seat and back seat respectively. [Dong Xiaofeng] quickly hid deeper, while Xiao Jun grabbed the pole at the back of the car.
1:12:30|1:12:41|The car drove onto the road, and across the street, [Dong Xiaofeng] also got on a motorcycle, slowly accelerating while adjusting her helmet. Shortly after, [Song Lao'er] left the pig shop, and across the street, [Dong Xiaofeng] was still keeping watch from the store.
1:12:41|1:12:55|Watching [Song Lao'er] leave, [Dong Xiaofeng] cracked melon seeds while following. As she walked, she spat or threw the melon seed shells on the ground, and glanced back at the workers walking with her. Turning into an alley, [Dong Xiaofeng] continued walking, but stopped cracking the melon seeds.
1:12:55|1:13:10|In front, [Song Lao'er] suddenly turned around, and [Dong Xiaofeng] quickly hid into the nearby doorway. As [Song Lao'er] walked and looked back, [Dong Xiaofeng] walked and hid, letting out a sigh of relief. Following closely behind the old man pulling the cow, [Dong Xiaofeng] carefully followed his steps and hid behind him. They turned into a narrower path.
1:13:10|1:13:26|Only [Song Lao'er] and [Dong Xiaofeng] were left. [Dong Xiaofeng] hid behind a wall, narrowly avoiding the turning [Song Lao'er]. He put on a helmet, then the pilot goggles on the helmet, raised two index fingers to psych himself up, pulled out a dagger and charged forward, but quickly pushed against a wall at the doorway of a house.
1:13:26|1:13:32|Managed to dodge, narrowly avoiding being seen by [Song Lao'er] who was about to turn around. [Dong Xiaofeng] was just about to charge forward again.
1:13:34|1:13:50|[Song Lao'er] was so scared that he immediately turned around, [Dong Xiaofeng] hurriedly went back, pushed open the door of the house and slipped in, putting the phone in his clothes. At this moment, the door lock outside knocked on the door due to the wind. [Dong Xiaofeng] held the knife handle and raised the dagger, holding her breath, her hand holding the dagger trembling slightly. After a moment of silence.
1:13:50|1:13:58|[Dong Xiaofeng] cautiously moved along the wall to observe, checked that no one was around, took out her phone from the inner pocket, and held the knife handle in her hand.
1:14:4|1:14:27|[Dong Xiaofeng] went to see [Qian Guixing], who raised his hand and slapped her, causing her to spin around and her glasses to fly off. After saying that, [Qian Guixing] took two steps back towards the sofa, then turned and walked away. [Dong Xiaofeng] hadn't recovered from the slap yet, squinting at [Qian Guixing]. Seeing that [Qian Guixing] didn't say anything, she hurried to pick up her glasses from the side, but accidentally bumped into the tea table.
1:14:27|1:14:39|[Dong Xiaofeng] touched his head with one hand and held his glasses with the other. He stood up, looked at the tea rack, put on his glasses, touched the tea rack, turned around, and walked towards [Qian Guixing] while adjusting his glasses. [Qian Guixing] glanced at him.
1:15:0|1:15:13|Qian Guixing pretended to hit him, but passed the paper he held in his hand to him. Dong Xiaofeng adjusted her glasses, unfolded the paper and saw that it was a copy of the photo found by the police in Wang Youquan's house. Dong Xiaofeng arrived at the Mingdu Building holding this copy of the photo.
1:15:14|1:15:25|Glancing at the three characters of "Ming Du Lou" and then at the photocopy in his hand, [Song Lao'er] walked towards Ming Du Lou. At this moment, he had already entered the surveillance area.
1:15:44|1:15:49|He wanted to get a closer look, but as [Song Lao'er] was about to leave, he quickly hid behind the door panel at the entrance to the rooftop.
1:15:49|1:16:1|[Song Lao'er] strode over angrily, pushed the iron gate, went down the stairs, [Dong Xiaofeng] hid behind the wooden board, his glasses were pushed to his nose in a hurry. He slowly turned around, now only [Yang Shuhua] remained on the rooftop watching [Song Lao'er] leave.
1:16:1|1:16:17|Dong Xiaofeng pushed her glasses and prepared to come out from behind the wooden board, but noticed the footsteps of Yang Shuhua over there. Yang Shuhua was holding a basin and also preparing to leave, so she retreated to her original position. Yang Shuhua and Dong Xiaofeng passed by each other, but she, full of thoughts, did not notice.
1:16:17|1:16:35|[Yang Shuhua] had just passed by herself, [Dong Xiaofeng] glanced sideways and immediately moved to the door to observe, watching [Yang Shuhua] disappear up the stairs. After a moment of thought, [Dong Xiaofeng] ran out, leaped over the tangled ropes on the rooftop and ran to the edge of the rooftop, clinging to the railing and looking down. After checking if there was anyone downstairs, he quickly turned his head and searched on the rooftop, fixed his eyes on the stone pillar in front of him.
1:16:35|1:16:57|[Dong Xiaofeng] ran over and squatted halfway, grabbed the stone pillar with both hands and turned it around, then grabbed the bottom of the stone pillar and lifted it up, moved it to the edge of the rooftop, and placed the stone pillar on the iron railing. He grabbed the iron rod on top of the stone pillar and looked down, while his other hand lightly protected the stone pillar, gently patting it, looking to both sides, and then down towards the building. [Dong Xiaofeng] was breathing heavily, sniffed, looked towards the front of the road below, and then looked back.
1:16:57|1:17:8|[Song Lao'er] who had just come down the stairs appeared in the field of vision. [Dong Xiaofeng] adjusted her breathing, holding the hand on the iron rod and repeatedly loosening and gripping it, estimating the time to push the stone pillar down. At this moment, [Song Lao'er] was walking directly below the falling stone pillar.
1:17:8|1:17:14|[Dong Xiaofeng] didn't even look, and quickly ran towards the door. As he ran downstairs, a crowd had already gathered downstairs, watching the noisy crowd.
1:17:14|1:17:25|[Dong Xiaofeng] stopped in her tracks, turned her eyes, and then walked over to that side. Some of the people in the crowd were pointing upwards, while others were looking up. [Dong Xiaofeng] walked while looking back, pushed aside the people in front, and squeezed in.
1:17:25|1:17:39|Walking and looking up together, shaking his head with a click, [Dong Xiaofeng] looked at the debris on the ground and followed the gaze forward, noticing [Song Lao'er] walking ahead, and then followed with his head tilted. [Song Lao'er] walked unsteadily.
1:17:39|1:17:43|[Dong Xiaofeng] hurriedly took two quick steps, only to be bumped into head-on by [Wang Youquan].
1:17:44|1:17:55|[Wang Youquan] slapped [Dong Xiaofeng] twice. [Dong Xiaofeng] covered her nose in pain, muttered softly, quickly looked around between two cars, then turned back, covered her nose and walked back, looking up at [Wang Youquan] who had already gone up the stairs, about to enter the building.
1:17:55|1:18:5|Only a rough outline can be seen. [Dong Xiaofeng] took two steps back, took out a photocopy from the inner pocket, looked up with her mouth open, unfolded the photocopy while looking down, then looked up at the building, and covered her still sore nose with her hand.
1:18:5|1:18:16|[Dong Xiaofeng] covered her nose with one hand and held a photocopy with the other as she quickly walked towards the intersection. After a few steps, she started running, and when she reached the road, she quickly stopped. The street suddenly became noisy, and [Dong Xiaofeng] stood sideways at the roadside.
1:18:16|1:18:23|Glancing around, and then moving a step to the side to get a better view blocked by the tree, [Song Lao'er] was not seen in front, so quickly turned around to look behind, but there was no sign of [Song Lao'er] either.
1:18:23|1:18:35|[Dong Xiaofeng] was attracted by the sound of the whistle, turned around, but it was just a passing car. [Dong Xiaofeng] looked in the direction she was originally looking for, looked back at the building, panting and nodding repeatedly, and stuffed the photocopy back into her pocket.
1:18:35|1:18:52|Biting her lip, nodding continuously, and glancing around privately, she spotted a noodle shop across the street with a sign that read "Duanji Lamb Noodles," selling noodles and powder rolls. [Dong Xiaofeng] sat at the entrance of the noodle shop, took off her glasses, pressed her nose, and stared at the roadside. Then she turned back to watch the shop owner making noodles. Just as she was looking, the shop owner finished making the noodles and brought them over in a clay pot.
1:18:52|1:19:16|[Dong Xiaofeng] immediately put on her glasses, raised the chopsticks in her hand as if to pick something, then remembered something, picked up the vinegar bottle next to her and poured some in, scooped a spoonful of chili into the pot, picked up two chopsticks, blew on the hot food, about to put it in her mouth. However, when she looked up, she saw [Wang Youquan] and [Yang Shuhua] across the street. While holding the chopsticks, her eyes were fixed on the opposite side, and her tongue touched the hot food, causing her to quickly let go. [Dong Xiaofeng] looked at the noodles in front of her, moved the chopsticks up and down a few times, her mouth also moving accordingly. She then turned her head to look across the street, still inserting the chopsticks into the pot and reaching into her pocket to take out a photo.
1:19:22|1:19:39|[Wang Youquan] handed over the ticket, and when [Dong Xiaofeng] arrived, she also handed over the ticket and asked the ticket inspector to tear it off. [Dong Xiaofeng] boarded the bus, looking back for a moment. At this time, [Wang Youquan] was already seated at the front of the bus. As [Dong Xiaofeng] walked towards the bus, she looked at [Wang Youquan].
1:19:39|1:19:51|[Wang Youquan] was knocked down and glanced up and down at [Dong Xiaofeng]. [Dong Xiaofeng] sat next to a fat aunt who had already fallen asleep, holding her arms and looking ahead, then straightened up and stretched her neck. The fat aunt next to her kept sleeping, leaning on [Dong Xiaofeng]'s shoulder.
1:19:51|1:20:2|[Dong Xiaofeng] pursed her lips and saw the fat auntie, tilting her head back. The fat auntie was still leaning towards her, so [Dong Xiaofeng] deliberately moved away, but the fat auntie ended up leaning on her back. After a while, the fat auntie's head returned to its original position and continued sleeping.
1:20:2|1:20:5|[Dong Xiaofeng] fell asleep, and their heads even leaned together as they slept.
1:20:5|1:20:24|After a while, Auntie Fat leaned towards the window, while [Dong Xiaofeng] fell asleep leaning on Auntie Fat. He slowly opened his eyes, adjusted his body, sat up a bit, turned his neck, and suddenly noticed something in front. He adjusted his glasses, looked ahead again, glanced at the window on the opposite side, turned forward, held onto the seats in front and opposite, stood up and walked towards the front, then held onto the seats on both sides and walked towards the front of the bus.
1:20:24|1:20:30|Looking around and not seeing [Wang Youquan], he hurried forward and patted the driver's head, asking.
1:20:34|1:20:45|[Dong Xiaofeng] opened her mouth wide, straightened her body, took a step back, and the driver, wearing gloves, touched the head that had just been hit. [Dong Xiaofeng] quickly walked to the back of the car, leaned against the seat and looked out of the rear window, then turned around and slapped the still sleeping fat aunt twice.
1:20:56|1:21:6|Back outside the Mingdu Building, [Dong Xiaofeng] got off the vehicle carrying livestock, looking dirty all over. After patting the vehicle, it drove away. [Dong Xiaofeng] wiped the lens with her hand, keeping her hand on the edge of the glasses, and looked at the Mingdu Building.
1:21:6|1:21:18|Then he put down his hand, crossed the road through the traffic with his legs, and walked towards the noodle shop. [Dong Xiaofeng] ordered a bowl of noodles outside the noodle shop and sat down, ready to wait for the opportunity. He kept staring at the opposite side, paying attention. The boss lady prepared the noodles and walked out of the shop with a clay pot.
1:21:26|1:21:38|[Wang Youquan] was walking towards [Dong Xiaofeng] counting money behind him. He folded the money and put it in his pocket as he approached. [Dong Xiaofeng] was lifting a chopstick of noodles, releasing steam. He blew on the steam, and as [Wang Youquan] passed by, the chair made a noise. [Dong Xiaofeng] looked up, just about to lower his head to eat.
1:21:38|1:21:49|He immediately raised his head and looked back at the path where Wang Youquan was coming. He was about to take a quick bite of noodles, but got burned by the hot noodles. He decided to stand up and chase after the person. He stumbled over a stool and picked up the nearby empty clay pot while he was at it.
1:21:49|1:22:3|[Dong Xiaofeng] held a clay pot in her right hand, following behind [Wang Youquan], panting as she took two quick steps. Suddenly, she rushed forward, raised the clay pot with both hands, and smashed it on [Wang Youquan]'s head. [Wang Youquan] fell to the ground immediately. Pedestrians on the roadside all stopped to watch, and some even walked down from the sidewalk.
1:22:3|1:22:15|Standing on the road, [Dong Xiaofeng] flicked away the dirt splashed on her head, grabbed [Wang Youquan]'s collar and dragged him to the side of the road. A van drove by, and [Wang Youquan] was completely unconscious. [Dong Xiaofeng] walked towards the tricycle at the entrance of Mingdu Building and said to the driver on the tricycle:
1:22:19|1:22:32|Master was awakened by the shouting of [Dong Xiaofeng], got off the tricycle, put on his Lei Feng hat, and walked over to help [Wang Youquan] on the ground. The tricycle drove on the road in the deserted mountains, with mountains on one side and a river on the other. The tricycle slowly descended the gentle slope.
1:22:32|1:22:39|At the unfinished road leading to the riverbank, where a boat is docked, [Song Lao'er] slowly came to a stop.
1:22:39|1:22:53|The tricycle driver watched as [Wang Youquan] pulled [Dong Xiaofeng] out of the car, then looked at the ground, and back at [Dong Xiaofeng]. [Dong Xiaofeng] glanced at [Wang Youquan], noticed the driver's gaze turning away, reached into her pocket, took out 100 yuan, and handed it to the driver without looking back.
1:22:53|1:23:8|The master took the money, [Dong Xiaofeng] leaned against the front of the car and said. The master nodded, [Dong Xiaofeng] gasped and said: The master turned his head to look, then glanced at [Dong Xiaofeng].
1:23:9|1:23:19|[Song Lao'er] started the tricycle and left after losing a head. [Dong Xiaofeng] even kicked the back of the tricycle before circling around to the other side of [Wang Youquan], standing with legs apart and looking down at [Wang Youquan].
1:23:27|1:23:40|Looking down, [Wang Youquan] was dragged onto the boat. His hands were tied, lying on the gangway of the boat, with the river water constantly surging towards him. Awakened by the river water, he opened his mouth and tried to lift his head, but was still choked by the water. [Dong Xiaofeng] watched from behind and walked to the winch next to the gangway.
1:23:43|1:23:54|The water is getting deeper, [Wang Youquan] is completely soaked in the water but can't get up. [Wang Youquan] can't hold his head up, it's completely buried in the water. Over here, [Dong Xiaofeng] speaks up. [Wang Youquan] struggles to turn his body, dry heaving.
1:23:58|1:24:4|[Dong Xiaofeng] turns the catapult winch, and the wheels of the catapult winch spin rapidly. [Wang Youquan]'s head is once again submerged in the water.
1:24:28|1:24:36|[Dong Xiaofeng] hangs on the chain of the winch, holding onto the winch board, looking at [Wang Youquan].
1:24:43|1:24:56|[Dong Xiaofeng] unfastened the chain, turned the lever winch again, the wheel spun, burying [Wang Youquan]'s head underwater once more. [Dong Xiaofeng] held onto the winch, stopping the wheel, when suddenly, a phone started ringing.
1:24:56|1:25:8|[Dong Xiaofeng] looked at her pocket, then glanced at the struggling [Wang Youquan], the posture of the turntable operator's open hand still maintained. She walked towards [Wang Youquan]. Her hand slowly dropped down as she walked behind [Wang Youquan].
1:25:8|1:25:20|With both hands, [Wang Youquan] first patted his buttocks, then moved towards his waist, and finally grabbed the back of his clothes to lift [Wang Youquan] up. When [Wang Youquan] turned around, he closed his eyes and leaned against [Dong Xiaofeng]'s chest. Dazed from being washed by water, [Wang Youquan] was lifted up by [Dong Xiaofeng].
1:25:20|1:25:28|He suddenly vomited heavily, [Dong Xiaofeng] also turned his head and retched at the smell, but still grabbed his collar to find the still ringing phone.
1:25:37|1:25:46|[Wang Youquan] took a peek, then headbutted [Dong Xiaofeng] in the face, causing her to fall to the ground. [Wang Youquan] then ran off, stepping onto the gangway while still retching. [Dong Xiaofeng] lay on the gangway, twitching.
1:25:47|1:26:4|[Wang Youquan] was still tied up, walking unsteadily. [Dong Xiaofeng] lifted her arm slowly to support herself as she stood up, her hand brushing against something. Using her other hand for support as well, she finally sat up straight, turned her face around, with two lines of blood dripping from [Dong Xiaofeng]'s nose and a broken pair of glasses hanging crookedly on her face.
1:26:6|1:26:17|The corner of the mouth twitched, raised a hand to adjust the glasses, but the bridge of the nose was also hit and bleeding just now. [Dong Xiaofeng] winced in pain, quickly stopped, lifted her leg and curled up, used her fingers to rub her nose bridge, but got blood on them.
1:26:18|1:26:30|Upon getting up, [Dong Xiaofeng] picked up an iron rod and walked with it. She went to find [Wang Youquan], holding her nose with one hand. At that moment, [Wang Youquan] came out of the driver's cabin and was spotted by [Dong Xiaofeng]. She ran up to him and threw the iron rod in her hand.
1:26:54|1:27:5|Without hesitation, [Dong Xiaofeng] picked up the iron rod and leaned on the railing, ready to chase. As he stood up and adjusted his glasses, using the iron rod for support, he took a step and was hit in the leg by the iron stool that [Wang Youquan] had already thrown. [Dong Xiaofeng] fell down the steps.
1:27:5|1:27:12|Clutching his leg and screaming, but quickly he stood up holding an iron stool against the railing. Realizing it was the wrong hand, he threw away the stool and picked up the iron rod on the ground.
1:27:12|1:27:25|Wang Youquan climbed up the steps again, reached the deck, and turned around to see him. Wang Youquan immediately took the fire extinguisher next to him and threw it towards Dong Xiaofeng. The gas in the fire extinguisher was released upon impact, creating a white cloud. Meanwhile, Dong Xiaofeng had already started chasing Wang Youquan with a stick.
1:27:25|1:27:38|One hit on the glass, then another hit on the glass, blood dripping from the nose of [Dong Xiaofeng], watching [Wang Youquan] fleeing, then turning back to block [Wang Youquan]. Grabbing [Wang Youquan]'s ankle and pulling hard, [Wang Youquan]'s shoe was pulled off.
1:27:38|1:27:44|[Dong Xiaofeng] bent down to tie her shoelaces, swaying her body as the shoes spun a few circles.
1:27:46|1:28:2|He pushed up his glasses and looked up, walked to the ladder, one hand holding his glasses, the other hand grabbing the ladder and climbing up. But when he poked his head out, he didn't see Wang Youquan up there. Dong Xiaofeng looked around, propped herself up with both hands and climbed up, staggering a few steps as soon as she got up.
1:28:3|1:28:21|After standing still and turning around, [Wang Youquan] was still not in sight. He then bent down and looked under the ladder, but still couldn't see him. Climbing to another corner and looking down, he stood up, turned around, looked around, held onto the mast and looked left and right, then fixed his eyes on the river. He saw [Wang Youquan] swimming towards the shore.
1:28:22|1:28:30|[Dong Xiaofeng] shouted towards [Wang Youquan], leaning against the mast and panting.
1:28:32|1:28:45|The iron hat on the mast was taken off by him and fell to the ground. [Dong Xiaofeng] could only drive the boat back to the shore, the gangway gradually approached the land, scooping up the soil on the ground and pushing it forward, and the boat came to a stop.
1:28:46|1:29:6|On the boat, [Dong Xiaofeng] walked off the deck with a pigeon-toed gait, limping along. One hand held onto her glasses, while the other hand was outstretched as she walked up the gangway towards the shore. She even stumbled a bit when stepping off the gangway. Bent legs, she walked step by step, with the sound of a police siren in the distance.
1:29:6|1:29:22|In the distance, a police car is turning down the hill on the road. [Dong Xiaofeng] stops and looks around, then walks in the same direction as the police car. At this moment, the police car also stops by the river, but [Dong Xiaofeng] is on the opposite side of the river.
1:29:22|1:29:30|Two people get out of the police car and walk towards the river. The fourth title appears - a messy mess is a mess.
1:29:30|1:29:55|At the entrance of a residential building, [Song Lao'er] drove up and pulled the brakes at the entrance. He opened the car door from the window with his left hand, holding a snake skin bag in his right hand. After getting out of the car and closing the door, he switched the snake skin bag to his right hand and walked into the alley ahead. At the end of the alley, there was a motorcycle parked at the entrance. [Song Lao'er] walked up the slope and entered the room. He placed the snake skin bag on the table and slowly opened it.
1:29:57|1:30:4|He took out the white suit and handed it to [Qian Guixing] across from him. At this moment, [Qian Guixing] in the red shirt had a pale face.
1:30:5|1:30:18|[Song Lao'er] stared at [Qian Guixing], who looked up and blinked, then placed an arm on the table and asked back. [Song Lao'er] reached into his inner pocket, took out the photo from the white suit, and found his own photo.
1:30:26|1:30:38|Pull out a photo of himself with [Qian Guixing]. [Qian Guixing] looked at the photo, then glanced at [Song Lao'er], and blinked.
1:30:40|1:30:48|Step back a bit, and say, "[Song Lao'er] put the photo in front of [Qian Guixing],"
1:31:13|1:31:20|[Song Lao'er] looked at [Qian Guixing] inquiringly, but [Qian Guixing] just smiled, turned his face away, and said:
1:31:29|1:31:45|[Song Lao'er] rolled his eyes and stared at [Qian Guixing], who swallowed hard, blinked, and let out a sigh. [Song Lao'er] continued to stare at [Qian Guixing], leaned back a bit, and said:
1:32:2|1:32:13|After Song Lao'er finished his deduction, Qian Guixing's mouth twitched, and it took a few moments before a smile emerged.
1:32:25|1:32:41|[Qian Guixing] quickly stood up and pressed the hang-up button, both of them leaning forward and looking at each other. The phone line swayed, [Song Lao'er] frowned and held the phone firmly. [Qian Guixing] took one hand off the table.
1:33:23|1:33:46|The two looked at each other, [Song Lao'er] blinked, slowly hung up the phone, looked elsewhere in confusion, then slightly aggrievedly lowered his head, sighed, and hesitated before speaking:
1:34:2|1:34:13|[Song Lao'er] tilted his head and didn't look at [Qian Guixing] anymore, while [Qian Guixing] nodded slightly.
1:34:28|1:34:44|[Song Lao'er] lowered his head even further as they both remained silent. [Qian Guixing] swallowed hard, [Song Lao'er] looked like a child who had made a mistake. [Qian Guixing] made the first move, tidying up the photos on the table. He placed the photos back on the table and then looked up to observe [Song Lao'er].
1:34:58|1:35:10|[Song Lao'er] took a deep breath with eyes closed, lowering his head even more. Just as he raised his head, [Song Lao'er]'s phone rang, and he took it out to answer.
1:35:21|1:35:30|[Song Lao'er] kicked [Qian Guixing] in the chest, pointing a gun at him and shouting. The two of them sat in [Song Lao'er]'s car and drove towards the repair shop.
1:35:31|1:35:43|[Song Lao'er] slammed on the brakes, at the door, [Dong Xiaofeng] was gnawing on sugar cane. As the car stopped, he used the hand holding a dagger to push his glasses down from his head. [Song Lao'er] got out of the car with a long gun and walked towards the steps at the door.
1:35:43|1:35:54|In front of them, [Dong Xiaofeng] was stepping on [Song Tao] sitting on an oil drum. When she saw [Song Lao'er], she immediately straightened up. [Song Lao'er] ran up the steps, [Dong Xiaofeng] spat out the sugarcane in her mouth, and [Song Lao'er] went to the back of the car to untie [Qian Guixing] who was tied up there.
1:35:54|1:36:5|[Song Lao'er] pushed [Qian Guixing] down the steps and grabbed him by the collar. Seeing this, [Dong Xiaofeng] threw the sugarcane, grabbed [Song Tao]'s collar, and then jumped off the oil drum. The two of them slowly approached each other, holding the people in their hands.
1:36:5|1:36:14|With a cloth stuffed in his mouth, [Qian Guixing] desperately shook his head to signal, while [Song Lao'er] fiercely held a long spear and [Dong Xiaofeng] slapped a knife on [Song Tao]'s face.
1:36:18|1:36:23|[Song Lao'er] fired a shot towards the sky, hitting the tin roof and causing a cloud of dust to fall.
1:36:33|1:36:38|[Song Lao'er] watched as his son approached, the gun still pointed at [Qian Guixing]'s shoulder. [Dong Xiaofeng] held a dagger, only able to watch with one eye open.
1:36:43|1:36:50|The two quickly got up, [Qian Guixing] turned around, and [Dong Xiaofeng] untied the rope for him. [Song Lao'er] took two steps back and waved to [Song Tao], while [Qian Guixing], who had untied the rope, raised his hand and slapped him.
1:37:6|1:37:12|[Dong Xiaofeng] waved the knife, blood splattered everywhere. [Song Lao'er] quickly covered [Song Tao]'s eyes, while [Dong Xiaofeng] held her nose and howled.
1:37:20|1:37:24|Here, [Song Lao'er] pushes [Song Tao] into the driver's seat and quickly turns the key.
1:37:24|1:37:35|[Dong Xiaofeng] turned around at the sound, took three steps and two steps over, while [Song Lao'er] anxiously lit a fire. [Dong Xiaofeng] took two steps up the steps, while [Song Lao'er] lit the fire and looked outside the window. [Dong Xiaofeng] had already walked to the car, holding the knife handle and stabbing in.
1:37:51|1:38:0|[Song Lao'er] tried his best to stop [Dong Xiaofeng], but [Song Tao] fired a shot. [Dong Xiaofeng] tumbled down the stairs and hit her head on a tub made of tires.
1:38:1|1:38:7|[Song Lao'er] looked out the window in surprise, then at [Song Tao]. Realizing what was happening, he quickly started a fire.
1:38:7|1:38:30|Looking down at the steps, [Dong Xiaofeng] drove away. Under the steps, [Dong Xiaofeng] lifted her head from the tires, her hair in a mess, her face stained with blood, oil, and water, panting, spitting out the water in her mouth, lying on the ground looking forward, then looking left and right, sticking her butt out and turning her head to look at the steps. Inside the car, [Song Lao'er] cried as he looked at [Dong Xiaofeng] in the rearview mirror, who was riding a motorcycle and catching up.
1:38:33|1:38:41|In the rearview mirror, [Dong Xiaofeng] grew larger and larger. [Song Lao'er] blinked and confirmed again, then stepped on the gas pedal while looking at [Dong Xiaofeng] in the mirror.
1:38:42|1:38:51|[Song Lao'er] shouted at [Song Tao] who was crying with a long spear in his arms. [Dong Xiaofeng]'s face was very swollen, following behind [Song Lao'er]'s car.
1:38:58|1:39:5|Turning the steering wheel left and right, [Song Lao'er] blocked [Dong Xiaofeng] behind the car, causing the roadside dust to be stirred up by [Song Lao'er]'s car, with [Dong Xiaofeng] following steadily behind.
1:39:5|1:39:24|[Song Lao'er] kept an eye on the front and back, changing gears with his feet, steering with his hands. He glanced back, but a car was coming from the opposite direction. He quickly steered and braked, but it was too late. The car rushed down the slope at the roadside, flipping over once it reached the bottom of the slope.
1:39:24|1:39:30|The front of the car was blocked by a stone, it backed up a bit, the hanging amulet inside the car swayed, and the car gradually stabilized.
1:39:31|1:39:46|[Dong Xiaofeng] slowly stopped the motorcycle, looked down the slope, twisted the key to turn off the engine, put down her feet for support, and looked down from the roadside, but the slope was too steep. [Dong Xiaofeng] tried hard to steady herself, panting as she looked down. She wanted to make sure whether the person below was alive or dead as the night fell.
1:39:46|1:40:8|[Dong Xiaofeng] rode back to the yard where she lived with the car lights on and the motorcycle. She slowly stopped downstairs, propped her feet on the ground. The sound of the motorcycle decreased, then she turned around, took out her phone, turned off the engine, and then put down her feet. She looked up at the building, dialed [Xiao Ping]'s phone, holding the phone in one hand.
1:40:8|1:40:17|One hand slid forcefully on the phone screen with the index finger. Looking upstairs, licked the lips, put the phone to the ear, and tapped the phone with the index finger.
1:40:26|1:40:53|[Dong Xiaofeng] got off the motorcycle and almost lost her balance. She turned around and looked upstairs. There was no sound on the phone. [Dong Xiaofeng] tilted her head and asked: As she turned her head, she saw two people standing at the door, and then turned her head again to see two more people at the entrance of the unit.
1:40:53|1:41:0|On the stairs, [Xiao Ping] ran down while holding onto the wall, two police officers grabbed her and covered her mouth. [Dong Xiaofeng] turned around to run, but police officers came from both front and back.
1:41:16|1:41:25|[Dong Xiaofeng] stood with one hand behind her back, looking up at [Xiao Ping] with a mournful expression as [Xiao Ping] struggled.
1:41:30|1:41:42|[Dong Xiaofeng] reached out with her phone in hand, leaning towards [Police Liu] in front of her. Then she turned back to look at the police surrounding her with guns, smiling and nodding at them.
1:42:13|1:42:26|Police Liu tilted his head in suspicion, Xiao Ping heard this and struggled excitedly. Dong Xiaofeng, with tears in her eyes and a wrinkled face, nodded slightly.
1:42:40|1:42:53|Chen fired a shot, hitting Dong Xiaofeng right between the eyebrows. Xiao Ping stood there with wide eyes, Dong Xiaofeng's eyes rolled up as she fell to the ground while still holding the brush stroke. Xiao Ping opened her hands and shouted.
1:42:54|1:43:14|Police Liu swallowed hard and looked at Xiao Chen, who was shooting. Upstairs, Xiao Ping was being held down, struggling. The police slowly approached Dong Xiaofeng, who was lying on the ground. One police officer kicked the knife away from Dong Xiaofeng, who fell into a pool of blood and was surrounded. The fifth title appears.
1:43:14|1:43:36|A chicken mushroom, with 5 mushrooms painted on it. On the village road, a white car with a Yunan A license plate slowly approached and stopped, and a foot in leather shoes stepped out. [Song Lao'er] and Song Tao, wearing neck braces, looked at the person getting out of the car. A pig was locked in a cage, eating and grunting.
1:43:40|1:43:49|The person in the car got out and asked, [Song Lao'er] struggled to snort at the pig and at the people.
1:43:55|1:44:4|Arriving at the car, [He Qingyong] lowered the ramp, lifted the cage containing the pig, and pushed it inside. In front, [Song Lao'er] opened the car door and then supported the neck brace behind.
1:44:6|1:44:23|[Song Lao'er] shouted to Song Tao in the back of the car. The white car drove up the road made by the car's wheels on the barren hill, with patches of dust floating from low to high, passing a puddle, bumping up and down and driving forward, the people in the car swaying, and the car stopped.
1:44:23|1:44:28|Wang Youquan, leaning on crutches, sat by the roadside with Yang Shuhua standing beside him.
1:44:56|1:45:12|[Yang Shuhua] supported [Wang Youquan], opened the car door for him, and the two got in. The pig in the back of the car was also heading to the same destination as them, while [Song Lao'er] turned his head with his hand on his neck.
1:45:21|1:45:30|In the mine, a white car drove onto the asphalt road.
