0:1:16|0:1:43|In this conflict, as a student, [Li Zihao] was also involved. During the struggle with the catchers, he used his body to protect his beloved [Lan Ruoyun]. However, [Lan Ruoyun] was still taken away by the catchers. He was also pinned down by two catchers, blood flowing from his head. He gritted his teeth and tried to break free from their control, but in the end, outnumbered, he was captured by the catchers as the thunder roared incessantly.
0:1:43|0:1:51|The heavy rain fell like broken beads, [Li Zihao] was stripped of his shirt and hung bare-shouldered in the square of the prison.
0:1:52|0:2:16|[Li Zihao] recalls the scene of his arrest, with [Lan Ruoyun] desperately calling out to him for help. He endured torture after being captured, with the captors using various cruel methods on him such as waterboarding, whipping, and electric shocks. He remembers the pain he suffered and struggles to lift his heavy head.
0:2:34|0:3:7|[Li Zihao] silently swore in his heart as three catchers in raincoats approached him, one of them shining a flashlight at him. The ground was already splashed with water as the catchers untied the rope. [Li Zihao] weakly fell into the water, and the two catchers lifted him up. The one holding the flashlight pinched [Li Zihao]'s chin, and [Li Zihao] suddenly opened his eyes.
0:3:7|0:3:30|Looking at the person in front of him, the person was scared by his eyes. [Li Zihao] seized the opportunity, using the strength of the people on both sides to kick forward in the air. The person in front holding a flashlight fell onto the wire mesh behind. [Li Zihao] quickly turned around, throwing a left hook, knocking down one person with a punch, and grabbing another person with a tight hug. The three of them started a melee in the rain, in the midst of intense fighting.
0:3:54|0:4:18|The guards in the prison waved their iron rods, creating chaos. They fell one after another, but [Li Zihao] didn't hesitate as he charged forward, trying to knock down the oncoming people. Suddenly, a force restrained him, the chain behind him stretched to its limit, lifting the rack from the ground. Due to this immense pulling force, [Li Zihao] uncontrollably leaned backward.
0:4:21|0:4:38|During the second day, the heavy rain had stopped, but the sky remained overcast. The Huangpu River seemed to be shrouded in a gloomy curtain, with its meandering waters deep and unfathomable. Smoke billowed from the chimneys of the steamboats on the river, while countless boats were moored along the riverbanks.
0:4:38|0:4:50|Fishermen are busy working, pedestrians and vehicles are constantly passing by on the streets, trams are speeding along the road on their designated route, three luxury cars are driving side by side, heading towards the center of Shanghai.
0:4:50|0:5:10|In the back seat of one of the cars sat a middle-aged man in a suit and a top hat, expressionless. He is called [Tang Qianqian], a well-known figure in the Shanghai Bund. The vehicle was driving through the city area, with many puddles remaining on the road after the heavy rain in the streets of Shanghai. Pedestrians were coming and going, while street vendors on the side occasionally shouted.
0:5:14|0:5:31|The car, wet with rain, slowed down at the intersection halfway through the journey. Then a gunshot rang out, and the driver in the driver's seat was shot dead. The car instantly lost control and crashed into a car on the opposite side, stopping. Someone upstairs fired several shots towards the street, and pedestrians on the street heard it.
0:5:31|0:5:52|Suddenly, the sound of gunshots caused panic. Several pedestrians were accidentally shot and covered their ears, bending their bodies to flee in all directions. Suddenly, a man broke through the window glass from a high building, rushing out from inside. He held a handgun in each hand, cleanly killing the people ambushed in the buildings on both sides. Then he smoothly landed on the roof of a car from the air, shooting down the last few people, causing chaos on the street.
0:5:52|0:6:13|After experiencing the sudden assassination, [Tang Qianqian] and the others drove to the prison. Inside the cell, [Fang Jie] was wearing a suit and playing with a silver dollar in his hand. Bored, he threw the silver dollar against the wall, only to have it bounce back into his hand. After repeating this action several times, the prison guard opened the cell door, followed by several burly men who walked in.
0:6:13|0:6:16|One person is holding a knife.
0:6:18|0:6:26|The prison guard closed the observation window on the door, and [Fang Jie], after receiving the silver coin rebounded back from the wall, did not continue to drop it down.
0:6:30|0:6:52|He got up from the bed, turned around to face several burly men, tossed the silver coins into the air, and quickly threw a punch at one of them. As the men swarmed in, [Fang Jie] skillfully dodged, lifted the blanket from the bed to cover several men underneath. In the chaos, [Fang Jie] seized the opportunity to kick one man in the chest, sending him crashing into the wall with a knife in hand. [Fang Jie] swiftly followed up with another powerful punch.
0:6:52|0:7:17|Hitting the man's face, a few burly men reacted. [Fang Jie] forcefully threw the silver dollar in his hand at one of them. The man's eye was scratched and he cried out in pain. [Fang Jie] grabbed a knife and quickly dealt with several people. One of them restrained [Fang Jie] and threw him onto the bed with force. The prison guard, hearing no sound, opened the surveillance window to check, then walked in and pushed aside the burly man lying on [Fang Jie]. Unexpectedly, [Fang Jie] had a knife hidden in his hand, he bent down and quickly moved towards...
0:7:17|0:7:30|The prison guard was stabbed hard in the abdomen. After the guard fell to the ground, [Fang Jie] withdrew the sly smile from earlier, his face filled with indifference.
0:7:30|0:7:51|He got up and walked out of the cell, kicked a prison guard away, and when one of the guards was about to shout, [Fang Jie] immediately cut his throat with a knife and quickly took his gun. The alarm sounded in the prison, and the guards rushed out shouting in Shanghainese. [Fang Jie], feeling helpless, had to run upstairs, surrounded by enemies in unfamiliar terrain.
0:7:51|0:8:14|Seeing the situation turning against him, [Fang Jie] fired a shot at a nearby cell door. The lock of the cell was opened, and he quickly rushed in, closed the door, and leaned against it. The prison guards outside saw this and gathered around the cell door. Inside, [Fang Jie] looked at the people in the room, but when the guards kicked open the door with their guns raised, he was nowhere to be seen.
0:8:14|0:8:19|There was only one [Li Zihao] lying on the ground, and one of the prison guards kicked [Li Zihao] a few times with his foot.
0:8:21|0:8:43|[Li Zihao] immediately stood up and snatched the gun from the prison guard, then fiercely kicked the guard's knee. [Fang Jie] descended from above and killed the guard, the sunlight pierced into the eyes of [Li Zihao] who hadn't seen sunlight for a long time. [Fang Jie] was pressed against the wall by [Li Zihao], but at this moment, a large number of prison guards rushed up from downstairs. [Li Zihao] handed the gun to [Fang Jie] and left.
0:8:53|0:9:5|[Li Zihao] rudely rushed through the incoming prison guards, throwing several guards from upstairs. [Fang Jie] immediately followed him and shot down a guard who was closely behind.
0:9:5|0:9:10|The following prison guards were tripped one after another, [Li Zihao] single-handedly took down a large group of guards, while [Fang Jie] held a gun in his hand.
0:9:26|0:9:43|The scene became restless and agitated, with heads popping out in support of the two individuals, shouting for them to beat up the prison guards. [Li Zihao] snatched the baton from a guard's hand and struck down one guard after another who tried to stop them. [Fang Jie], on the other side, swung heavy punches left and right, knocking a guard to the ground. Feeling unsatisfied, he grabbed the guard by the collar, slammed him to the ground, and kicked him fiercely.
0:9:45|0:9:51|A prisoner in the adjacent cell cheered and shouted for [Fang Jie], urging him to fight to the death.
0:10:23|0:10:29|At the same time, Li Zihao also pushed open the door.
0:10:39|0:11:5|The police officer outside the building fired his gun at the two people on the high-rise, shattering the bricks and tiles on the roof, with fragments flying everywhere. The prisoner inside the square fence excitedly stepped on the wire mesh and shouted towards the building, urging them to run faster. The gunshots continued without pause. Suddenly, [Fang Jie] tripped over the bricks under his feet, his body leaning and quickly falling on the eaves. [Li Zihao] noticed this and instead of just thinking about himself, he quickly turned around and grabbed [Fang Jie]'s hand, hoping to hold him.
0:11:5|0:11:16|Jie, but it was inconvenient on the roof, [Li Zihao] was still dragged down by [Fang Jie], and the two of them fell from the roof, tumbling down from the bamboo scaffolding under construction, and landed heavily on the ground.
0:11:16|0:11:29|[Li Zihao] quickly got up and looked around vigilantly, then found a manhole nearby and forcefully opened it. [Fang Jie] frowned and looked behind, saying,
0:11:39|0:11:51|[Li Zihao] threw [Fang Jie] in. At this moment, the air in a Shanghai nightclub was filled with the smell of smoke and alcohol, and the music was so loud it almost deafened people.
0:12:12|0:12:41|Landed on the car downstairs, at this moment [Tang Qianqian] with a dark hat pressed on her head walked towards a man in the ballroom, the man named [Ye Qishan], he twitched his mouth when he saw [Tang Qianqian],
0:13:28|0:13:34|After speaking, [Tang Qianqian] took a sip of red wine, making [Ye Qishan] feel a bit uneasy. He forced a smile and lit a cigar.
0:13:38|0:14:23|In a secluded section of the road, [Li Zihao] opened the manhole cover. He cautiously stuck his head out, looked around, made sure it was safe, then leaped out of the sewer onto the road. Finally, [Fang Jie] struggled to climb out of the sewer. [Fang Jie] collapsed on the ground again. At that moment, a car suddenly approached, and the people inside started shooting at the two. [Li Zihao] quickly jumped and lay flat on the car window.
0:14:23|0:14:36|Two people in the back seat firing continuously, Li Zihao threw a heavy punch at them, the person in the front passenger seat tried to shoot at him, Li Zihao opened the car door and threw him out, then quickly dealt with everyone inside and drove the car himself.
0:14:36|0:14:56|[Fang Jie] is still in crisis, with the police officers following closely behind him, continuously shooting at him. The gunfire ignited the oil drums on the side of the road. [Li Zihao] originally intended to leave, but upon seeing the situation, he quickly turned the car around towards [Fang Jie]. [Fang Jie] skillfully dodged the bullets in the hail of gunfire, occasionally firing back with the handgun in his hand. The vehicles behind were about to catch up with [Fang Jie].
0:14:56|0:15:8|In front, Li Zihao's car appeared. Li Zihao smoothly turned the car around again. Fang Jie leaped onto the car. Li Zihao stepped on the gas pedal, and the two temporarily avoided the threat of bullets. However, the vehicles behind did not give up.
0:15:19|0:15:34|The car chasing from behind overtook them at the bend in the road, [Li Zihao] grabbed [Fang Jie]'s restless hand. Their vehicle was hit by the pursuing car from behind, and only then did [Fang Jie] realize the situation and straightened up.
0:15:34|0:15:57|Pulling out a gun to shoot at the police officers in the opposite car, at this moment, two cars collided. [Fang Jie] failed to shoot smoothly, so he raised the gun with both hands again, aiming at the vehicle in front. The police officers realized [Fang Jie]'s actions and quickly stepped on the gas to overtake their car. [Fang Jie] could only give up again, but unexpectedly, after overtaking, the police officers once again violently turned the steering wheel.
0:15:57|0:16:22|Shortly after, [Li Zihao] stopped steadily in front of the car. [Li Zihao] was forced to stop the car, took a brief rest, then stepped on the gas pedal and rammed into the car in front. With the force, the two cars spun in place. [Fang Jie] took the opportunity to shoot at the police car. After a brief confrontation, the police car was hit and stopped on the side of the road. [Li Zihao] quickly reversed, then stepped on the gas pedal again, flipping the police car completely. The vehicles rolled several times on the road.
0:16:22|0:16:31|Sliding on the slippery road surface for a distance, [Li Zihao] finally came to a stop, quickly moving forward and colliding with the approaching car not far away.
0:16:34|0:16:50|Finally, the car quickly reversed. [Fang Jie] took the opportunity to shoot at the car in front, and the opposite patrol immediately began to fire back. In order to avoid the bullets, [Fang Jie] and [Li Zihao] crouched down in the car. Surprisingly, there was a hand grenade in the car. [Fang Jie] picked up the hand grenade, pulled out the safety pin, and threw it outside.
0:16:56|0:17:9|The police car was completely blown up, [Fang Jie] and [Li Zihao] successfully evaded the pursuit, and the two of them left the scene, driving towards the center of Shanghai. Several dancers in sexy cheongsams were shouting to attract customers at the entrance of the dance hall.
0:17:29|0:17:54|[Fang Jie] got out of the car and was surrounded on the left and right. [Li Zihao] ignored his calls and drove away directly. Three luxury cars drove into a mansion on the street one after another. There were several guards at the entrance of the mansion. After entering the courtyard, a large number of people were also gathered in the courtyard, each holding a weapon. After the vehicles entered, the guards closed the large iron gate at the entrance of the courtyard. The person in the front passenger seat quickly opened the rear door of the car, and [Tang Qianqian] was wearing a windbreaker.
0:17:54|0:18:12|Coming out of the car, Li Zihao took a glance at the people gathered in the yard before striding into the house. Inside the house, Fang Jie was holding a pistol and walking out aggressively, followed by six henchmen, each holding a gun. Seeing Tang Qianqian walking in, Fang Jie immediately complained to her.
0:18:20|0:19:6|[Tang Qianqian] remained calm, grabbing [Fang Jie] who was trying to leave. With a helpless look, [Tang Qianqian] glanced at him and walked forward. [Fang Jie] struggled to contain his anger, gritted his teeth, took a deep breath, and followed [Tang Qianqian]. The mansion was still filled with people holding weapons, and the heavy rain struck again. [Li Zihao] drove to a secluded alley, enduring the pain in his body, and struggled to open the car door.
0:19:6|0:19:34|Leaning against the car door in the heavy rain for a while, he finally turned around and walked slowly towards the alley. With messy hair mixed with rainwater sticking to his face, he shuffled his weak feet and took a few steps before collapsing on the slippery road. Raindrops fell like steel beads on the ground, mercilessly beating on his face. [Li Zihao] lay on the ground for a moment, then struggled to stand up again with great difficulty.
0:19:34|0:19:43|Li Zihao then grabbed the iron gate, leaned on the unlocked gate, and flipped it to one side. He was reminded of the painful memories in the capture room.
0:19:47|0:20:6|The cruel punishments have deeply rooted in his heart, causing indelible trauma. His head is throbbing as if it's about to explode. He staggers down the alley, holding his head, the uneven ground filled with rainwater. When he reaches a corner in front of a house, he sits down on the ground along the wall.
0:20:6|0:20:24|The impact of the fall reopened the wound on his body, causing him to gasp for air. He saw three children huddled under a nearby shed. The slightly older child stood up, and the youngest girl also stood up to look at him. When Li Zihao opened his mouth to drink rainwater, the little girl tremblingly carried a bowl of water towards him.
0:20:26|0:20:43|Li Zihao carefully placed the bowl in front of him, glanced at the bowl filled with water on the ground without moving, then leaned back against the wall, looking up at the sky hopelessly as the long night finally broke. The next day, during the day, Fang Jie was at the Shanghai dock wearing a suit, holding a bouquet of flowers in his hand, talking to a horse.
0:21:14|0:21:42|[Fang Jie] heard that someone he had been waiting for was about to disembark, so he hurried over. At this moment, an elegant young woman descended from the deck, looking around at the people on the pier. She was Tang Hexuan's beloved daughter, [Tang Qianqian], and also the long-time object of [Fang Jie]'s affection. Upon seeing [Tang Qianqian], [Fang Jie] happily waved at her, and [Tang Qianqian] smiled back, then walked towards him through the vehicles and crowds in the middle of the road.
0:21:54|0:22:0|[Tang Qianqian] shyly smiled and then took the flowers.
0:22:22|0:22:38|Tang Qianqian then got on the carriage, followed by Fang Jie. The coachman waved the reins and the carriage started moving towards the direction of the cinema. Tang Qianqian looked at the speeding cars on the road and then at the horse in front of her.
0:23:33|0:23:45|[Fang Jie]'s carriage was hit from behind, causing it to overturn. He was thrown to the side of the road and happened to land where [Li Zihao] was. Several gunmen then got out of the car and started shooting towards the street.
0:23:45|0:23:52|Suddenly, there was smoke and chaos on the street. [Fang Jie], upon hearing the gunshots, struggled to get up from the ground.
0:23:53|0:23:58|The person outside with a gun, upon hearing [Fang Jie]'s voice, shot towards him but was promptly saved by [Li Zihao].
0:24:0|0:24:5|[Tang Qianqian] was grabbed by a man who tried to take her away, but she kicked him away.
0:24:5|0:24:33|The sound of gunshots startled the horse, causing it to run forward. [Tang Qianqian], who was sitting in the back seat, suddenly leaned backwards and fell down, caught by a large net attached to the back of the carriage. The net also entangled [Li Zihao] not far away, and the two were dragged by the out-of-control carriage. [Tang Qianqian] struggled to climb back onto the carriage, but her plan was thwarted by a car suddenly turning, narrowly avoiding hitting [Li Zihao] behind her. [Fang Jie] desperately chased after them.
0:24:36|0:24:46|He snatched a passerby's bicycle and quickly rode after the person. The person shouted at him, but he didn't have time to respond. The person who had just held a gun drove to chase the carriage, and [Tang Qianqian] was in great danger at this moment. He exerted all his strength to chase after, not daring to slack off in the slightest.
0:24:46|0:24:57|[Li Zihao] finally tried to stand up in the long drag of the carriage. He bent over to untie the net bound to his feet with great effort, and then struggled to maintain balance, preventing the carriage from throwing him out.
0:24:57|0:25:17|Pedestrians on the road saw the out-of-control carriage and panicked, running in all directions. Some people who didn't have time to escape were ruthlessly knocked down by the carriage. At this moment, the gunmen's car had caught up, driving side by side with the carriage. On the passenger side, a man jumped onto the carriage, trying to throw [Tang Qianqian] off the carriage. [Tang Qianqian] struggled desperately, clinging to the edge of the carriage.
0:25:17|0:25:39|But she was still thrown down by the man and landed on the net behind the car. Fortunately, the net caught a few wooden boxes, which prevented [Tang Qianqian] from getting hurt. She desperately grabbed onto the net, when suddenly a car rushed out from the opposite side of the road, heading straight towards her. [Tang Qianqian] opened her mouth wide in a scream, and [Li Zihao] also saw the scene. He quickly got up and hugged [Tang Qianqian], pulling her up, and the two narrowly escaped the danger.
0:25:39|0:26:1|Without even catching a breath, the person in the car beside him grabbed [Tang Qianqian] and tried to throw her out again. [Tang Qianqian] desperately struggled to break free from the person's grip. Finally, the man in the back seat of the carriage swung a wooden stick at him, but at that moment, [Fang Jie] arrived. He shot the man in the heart with a pistol, saving [Tang Qianqian] once again. To avoid the hand reaching out from the car beside her, [Tang Qianqian] leaned to the side.
0:26:1|0:26:12|Lying in the arms of [Li Zihao], [Li Zihao] finally turned over and grabbed the reins on the carriage, trying to keep the carriage steady. Unexpectedly, several men with axes jumped onto the carriage next to him and started hacking wildly.
0:26:12|0:26:34|[Li Zihao] cleverly dodged the axe, while [Tang Qianqian] was held down by someone, gripping the edge of the carriage tightly. After knocking down a person, [Li Zihao] kicked the person holding [Tang Qianqian] off the carriage. Behind them, [Fang Jie] was still desperately riding a bicycle, trying to catch up. Seeing that [Tang Qianqian] was about to be dragged down by the people in the car, [Li Zihao] swiftly performed a side kick.
0:26:34|0:26:51|The man was kicked back into the car, and another man came up on the other side of the car. He wore leather shoes and stomped heavily on Li Zihao's chest. Li Zihao grabbed his tie and threw him onto the road. The enemies kept coming up onto the carriage, and Li Zihao fought with all his might to take them down one by one.
0:26:51|0:27:12|Unexpectedly, there was a fish that slipped through the net behind them at this moment. The person was seen holding a gun and firing several shots at [Tang Qianqian] and [Li Zihao] on the carriage. Fortunately, the carriage was unstable, and the person did not hit anyone with the shots. [Li Zihao] quickly held [Tang Qianqian] and crouched down to avoid the bullets, then stood up and used an axe to cut off the net behind the carriage.
0:27:12|0:27:33|The two successfully avoided the crisis again. On the other side, [Fang Jie] took a shortcut and intercepted the enemy's car. He knocked down the bicycle and stepped on it with both feet, sliding from the side of the road to the middle of the road. With a gun in each hand, he fired several shots at the people in the car. The driver in the driver's seat was shot, causing the vehicle to completely lose control and crash into the curb on the side of the street. Then [Fang Jie] headed towards the car's fuel tank.
0:27:33|0:27:49|Firing a few shots, the vehicle instantly exploded. Then [Fang Jie] ran to a car on the side of the road, quickly opened the door, dragged the person inside out, got in the car, and searched for [Tang Qianqian]. At this moment, he was extremely anxious, stepping on the gas pedal hard, fearing that something unexpected might happen to [Tang Qianqian], as waves of assassins kept appearing.
0:28:5|0:28:23|Li Zihao and Tang Qianqian were shot at with a gun. Tang Qianqian was so scared that she could only hide in Li Zihao's arms. The construction workers were also frightened, shouting loudly and running to other places. The assassin kept shooting at them. The carriage damaged the bamboo construction bridge, but Li Zihao still pulled hard on the reins, desperately controlling the direction of the carriage.
0:28:25|0:28:38|With the construction bridge reaching its end, [Tang Qianqian] tightly closed her eyes and held onto [Li Zihao]. The carriage jerked back onto the ground, and the back seat immediately shattered. [Fang Jie] arrived in time and crashed into the assassin's car.
0:28:38|0:29:9|Tang Qianqian was still in shock, breathing heavily. Fang Jie got out of the car and slammed the door shut without hesitation. He then fired two shots towards the overturned car. The sound of a baby crying could be heard from the residential building. After returning to the manor, Fang Jie recounted the incident to Ye Qishan. Ye Qishan listened calmly without saying a word.
0:29:9|0:29:35|With one hand in his pocket, Li Zihao walked straight to Fang Jie. The sweat on Fang Jie's forehead from the fight had not completely disappeared. He watched as Tang Qianqian took a gun from his own clothes and walked towards him from behind. No one in the living room dared to move, including Fang Jie. Fang Jie was terrified as Tang Qianqian shot each of his subordinates in the room one by one.
0:29:35|0:29:42|[Fang Jie] looked at [Tang Hexuan] in horror, took a few deep breaths, and stood still, not daring to move.
0:29:46|0:29:57|[Tang Hexuan] left straight away, with his close subordinate following closely behind. [Fang Jie] swallowed nervously and quickly caught up as well. At that moment, [Tang Qianqian] was in the room bandaging [Li Zihao]'s wound.
0:30:23|0:30:48|[Li Zihao] kept his head down and ignored [Tang Hexuan]. At this moment, all [Tang Hexuan] could see in his eyes was his daughter, [Tang Qianqian], who was in his arms. [Li Zihao] lifted his eyes and glared fiercely at [Tang Hexuan]. The person in front of him reminded him of the day before he went to prison.
0:30:48|0:31:11|It's dinner time, and the dining table is set with high-end dishes. [Li Zihao] is dressed in clean and tidy clothes. No one at the table has the appetite to eat, each staring blankly at the food in front of them. [Fang Jie] was the first to speak, breaking the silence.
0:31:23|0:31:42|[Tang Qianqian] snorted coldly, [Fang Jie] awkwardly paused for a moment, then continued speaking. With an admiring look in her eyes, [Tang Qianqian] said to [Li Zihao] beside her.
0:32:25|0:32:35|Upon hearing [Li Zihao] suddenly speak, [Fang Jie] looked surprised, dinner ended, and [Tang Qianqian] sat in the garden.
0:32:52|0:33:1|[Tang Hexuan] walked up from behind and put the coat on [Tang Qianqian].
0:33:36|0:33:49|[Tang Qianqian] watched as her father looked up at the sky again, and those words seemed to strike a chord with [Tang Hexuan]. He lowered his head to look at the grass, his face filled with melancholy.
0:33:59|0:34:8|He avoided the gaze of [Tang Qianqian], pursed his own lips, and [Tang Qianqian] leaned on his shoulder.
0:35:25|0:35:34|[Tang Hexuan] sent someone to investigate [Li Zihao]'s identity.
0:35:50|0:36:11|[Fusheng] walked and talked, then helped [Tang Hexuan] take off the coat draped over his shoulders, and casually took his hat. After [Tang Hexuan] sat in the office chair, he handed the documents he had investigated to [Tang Hexuan], who carefully looked at the documents.
0:36:29|0:36:55|[Tang Hexuan] walked at the front, followed by [Fang Jie], and a group of people including [Li Zihao] entered a hall. Many people stood on both sides of the hall. [Tang Hexuan] sat directly on the chair in the middle, followed by [Li Zihao] sitting on the chair next to him. The people in the hall all faced [Tang Hexuan] in unison. After the door closed, [Tang Hexuan] leisurely began to speak.
0:36:57|0:37:15|This is [Li Zihao], my newly recognized godson. As [Tang Hexuan] was about to leave, [Li Zihao] caught up with him, and the whole hall bowed their heads and knelt down on one knee facing [Li Zihao].
0:38:5|0:38:19|A meaningful smile appeared. The night in Shanghai never seemed to tire, with the dance hall lit up in red and green, filled with music and dance every night. Jazz music and the dancers on stage always left people feeling dizzy and intoxicated.
0:38:19|0:38:54|In the dance floor, men and women were swaying their waists. [Fang Jie] led [Li Zihao] into the ballroom. [Li Zihao] observed the environment of the ballroom silently following [Fang Jie]. Their arrival attracted quite a bit of attention, with people around looking at them. After [Li Zihao] settled down, [Fang Jie] smiled and asked. [Li Zihao] didn't say much, but looked at the dancers on the stage. At this moment, several cars arrived outside the ballroom. The drivers parked the cars and opened the back doors.
0:38:54|0:39:20|[Tang Hexuan] walked out from inside, he looked up at the sign of the ballroom and let out a long sigh, then adjusted his hat, frowned, showing a troubled expression. Carrying his thoughts, he walked towards the ballroom. When [Li Zihao] saw [Tang Hexuan] coming, he glanced up with the corner of his eye. [Tang Hexuan] paid no attention to anyone, lowered his eyes to watch the dancers on stage. At the next table, [Ye Qishan] was holding a cigar.
0:39:41|0:39:55|The new dance begins as the lights on the stage slowly scan again. A dancer in a gown with a fan partially covering her face appears. She slowly turns around, and as the music progresses, she gradually lowers the fan covering her face to reveal her true identity.
0:40:20|0:40:29|He looked at the people on the stage and thought of what happened the day before he went to prison.
0:42:13|0:42:22|Taking another step forward, looking closely, a large crack appeared on the mirror in front of the sink, with some glaring bloodstains hanging in the middle.
0:42:28|0:42:35|A Frenchman named Owen walked up to [Tang Hexuan] and asked in French, "[Tang Hexuan]," as [Tang Hexuan] turned to look at him.
0:44:35|0:44:41|The people present burst into laughter upon hearing Ma San's words. Owen looked at [Tang Hexuan] again and said to him,
0:45:8|0:45:16|Ma Sanli blurted out, Owen stood up and walked towards [Tang Hexuan], then sat on the chair next to him, but [Tang Hexuan] didn't look at him.
0:45:44|0:46:2|Mocking [Tang Qianqian] for not being careful enough, after finishing the song, [Lan Ruoyun] went backstage and picked up a glass of wine, drinking it all in one go. [Li Zihao] walked in from outside, frowning as he looked at her, his eyes filled with concern and worry, he walked towards [Lan Ruoyun] step by step.
0:46:2|0:46:31|[Lan Ruoyun] saw [Li Zihao] behind her in the mirror. She looked intently at the reflection in the mirror, confirming that it was [Li Zihao]. Slowly standing up, her eyes never left the mirror, as if afraid that the person in the mirror would suddenly disappear. She slowly turned her body, moving her gaze from the mirror to the person behind her. As their eyes met, [Li Zihao] and [Lan Ruoyun] locked eyes.
0:47:12|0:47:22|Saying that, [Lan Ruoyun] finished another glass of wine in one gulp.
0:47:36|0:47:44|[Li Zihao] took out a pocket watch from his coat pocket, inside of which was a photo of him and [Lan Ruoyun]. [Lan Ruoyun] looked at the watch.
0:47:55|0:48:16|[Lan Ruoyun] turned her head away from [Li Zihao] with tears in her eyes, lifted the wine glass again. This time, her hand began to tremble uncontrollably.
0:48:44|0:49:5|[Li Zihao] hugged [Lan Ruoyun] tightly, and after receiving his embrace, her emotions gradually calmed down.
0:50:5|0:50:33|The brief reunion was eventually interrupted. Downstage, Tang Qianqian couldn't see Li Zihao, so she gestured to the person next to her to go find him. Lan Ruoyun's lips trembled, at this moment she didn't know what to say, she embraced Li Zihao with both hands, and then kissed him forcefully on the lips.
0:50:33|0:51:6|At this moment, [Tang Qianqian]'s secretary Fusheng approached the backstage. He looked around and didn't see [Li Zihao] anywhere. He opened [Lan Ruoyun]'s room, where only [Lan Ruoyun] was present. After you finished speaking, he turned and left. When he returned to the audience seat, he saw [Li Zihao] already sitting there, and [Lan Ruoyun] also took the stage to start singing.
0:51:26|0:51:48|The next morning, [Li Zihao] arrived at a secluded village with anger. He entered a house, and a man came down the stairs. The man, upon seeing him, did not appear surprised, but hesitated for a moment. When the man walked up to him, [Li Zihao] forcefully pressed him against the door.
0:53:24|0:53:48|Mr. Luo was shocked when he heard it, then nodded. [Li Zihao] glared at him fiercely, then turned to look at the ground in front of him, his eyes full of hatred.
0:53:54|0:54:30|The next day, Li Zihao drove to the manor with Lan Ruoyun sitting in the back of his car. When the car stopped, Li Zihao got out of the driver's seat, and Lan Ruoyun slowly got out of the car. Li Zihao reached out to close the car door, but Lan Ruoyun stopped him and closed the door herself. As she looked up at Li Zihao, Tang Qianqian, who happened to be coming out of the hall, saw this scene.
0:54:31|0:54:53|Tang Qianqian stood at the door watching the two, Lan Ruoyun walked past Li Zihao towards the hall. Li Zihao stood still, Lan Ruoyun, who was walking up the steps, saw Tang Qianqian, paused for a moment, then continued walking forward. Tang Qianqian also walked slowly towards her, the two stood facing each other. Tang Qianqian glanced at Lan Ruoyun and then looked at Li Zihao not far away.
0:54:53|0:54:56|[Lan Ruoyun] also turned to look behind her,
0:56:19|0:56:34|[Tang Qianqian] snorted and walked past [Lan Ruoyun], then headed towards [Li Zihao]. [Li Zihao], not far away, faintly heard the conversation between the two. When he heard that they stopped talking, [Li Zihao] let out a sigh and walked up the steps.
0:56:35|0:56:52|[Tang Qianqian] coldly glanced at [Li Zihao], then turned and left without a word. As he lifted his head, he met eyes with [Lan Ruoyun]. He walked towards the hall, and [Lan Ruoyun] quickly said to him,
0:56:55|0:57:2|Upon hearing this, [Li Zihao] turned around and looked at [Lan Ruoyun].
0:57:6|0:57:21|In a Christian church, a huge cross is placed in the center. [Tang Qianqian] sits devoutly with her hands crossed on her chest on the seat below.
0:57:36|0:57:56|The silent clouds rolled again, the fierce wind and rain swept over Shanghai once more, and the roar echoed in the empty church for a long time. [Tang Qianqian] walked out of the church after finishing her prayers, standing at the church door watching the rain outside. The rainwater drifted onto her clothes with the wind, and [Li Zihao] quickly handed her an umbrella.
0:58:31|0:58:46|[Tang Qianqian] stood still, pondering over what [Li Zihao] had said. She looked at the pouring rain, then walked down the stairs of the church. The heavy rain instantly soaked her through, but she didn't care at all. She turned around and said to [Li Zihao],
0:58:58|0:59:22|After confessing loudly to [Li Zihao], [Tang Qianqian] walked down the steps in the rain. Not far away, [Fang Jie] heard these heart-wrenching words. Upon seeing him, [Tang Qianqian] ignored him and ran towards the car. After listening to [Tang Qianqian]'s confession, [Li Zihao] did not react. He walked down from the church entrance and stood next to [Fang Jie]. [Fang Jie] took out a lighter and lit a cigarette.
0:59:22|0:59:30|At this moment, [Li Zihao] is filled with guilt towards [Fang Jie]. He avoids looking into [Fang Jie]'s eyes. After taking a deep drag of his cigarette, [Fang Jie] says to him,
0:59:38|0:59:52|After saying these words, [Fang Jie] turned and left, while [Li Zihao] stood silently in place. On the other side, [Tang Qianqian] went to the Japanese consulate and met Takada.
0:59:58|1:0:17|[Tang Hexuan] bowed slightly towards Gaotian, who nodded back at him. Then Gaotian stood up from the couch, and [Tang Hexuan] quickly followed suit. The two of them walked to the doorway together and looked outside.
1:0:20|1:0:36|[Tang Hexuan] nodded at him repeatedly, Takada frowned and glanced at him, then turned and walked into the house. Afterwards, [Tang Hexuan] left the Japanese consulate and returned to his own estate.
1:0:36|1:1:1|The guard at the gate quickly opened the iron gate upon hearing the sound of the car, allowing the car to smoothly stop downstairs. Fusheng hurried forward to open the door for [Tang Hexuan], placing one hand on the car roof to prevent [Tang Hexuan] from hitting his head. After getting out of the car, [Tang Hexuan] walked and instructed Fusheng.
1:1:7|1:1:30|The record player in the room is playing music. [Tang Qianqian] is sitting on the sofa alone, drinking. [Li Zihao] hesitates before entering the room after opening the door. After hanging up his coat, [Li Zihao] sits on the sofa beside her.
1:1:34|1:2:8|[Tang Qianqian] walked to the record player with a glass of wine, turned up the music, then took off her shoes, put on [Li Zihao]'s sunglasses, and started dancing. [Li Zihao] stood with his back to her, looking at the things on the table, thinking about how to deal with this situation. He took a deep breath, then got up and walked towards the dancing [Tang Qianqian].
1:2:9|1:2:21|After spinning around, [Tang Qianqian] fell into the arms of [Li Zihao].
1:2:38|1:2:47|[Tang Qianqian] grabbed [Li Zihao]'s hand and gave him a slap, then she started shaking [Li Zihao]'s hand.
1:2:58|1:3:14|Tang Qianqian dropped her sunglasses, took advantage of Li Zihao's distraction to throw herself backward, causing everything on the table to fall to the ground. Li Zihao was knocked down by Tang Qianqian. Fang Jie heard a strange noise coming from Li Zihao's room, thought of his beloved being taken away, stood still for a moment, then simply left.
1:3:18|1:3:37|Under the influence of alcohol, [Tang Qianqian]'s face flushed, her eyes appearing lazy and hazy. [Li Zihao] lay motionless on the ground. [Tang Qianqian] looked at him lying on the ground, then slowly leaned in, closed her eyes, and kissed him. At the moment before their lips touched, she collapsed onto [Li Zihao].
1:3:38|1:3:57|Upon returning to the room, [Fang Jie] started drowning his sorrows with alcohol. He poured a glass and drank it all in one go. On the table, the puppy gift given by [Tang Qianqian] was nodding towards him. He grew increasingly impatient as he looked at it, and eventually took the puppy away.
1:4:58|1:5:10|[Tang Hexuan] and [Li Zihao], [Fang Jie] briefly discussed and then arrived together at the Paradise Ballroom.
1:5:10|1:5:30|In the gap when [Tang Hexuan] went to the restroom, his subordinate suddenly told him that he hadn't had a chance to wash his bent waist yet. [Gaotian] immediately walked into the restroom. After seeing himself in the mirror, [Tang Hexuan] slowly straightened up and turned to look at him, then took two steps towards him.
1:5:35|1:6:16|[Takada] handed a sealed document bag to [Tang Hexuan]. [Tang Hexuan] took it and looked at the words on the cover, then at [Takada]. [Takada] gave him a sinister smile, then turned and left the restroom. [Tang Hexuan] opened the sealed bag, took out the documents inside, flipped through them one by one. His expression gradually turned serious. After finishing reading, he returned to the ballroom, where there were no singing hostesses as usual, but instead a crowd of people sitting below the stage.
1:6:16|1:6:21|This has turned into the scene of the election meeting for the Chinese directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the French Concession.
1:6:52|1:7:45|Upstairs, an assassin fired a shot at Tang Hexuan's chest, causing chaos at the scene. Ye Qishan and Owen watched Tang Hexuan fall after being shot before leaving the scene. Fang Jie, Li Zihao, and others fought against the assassins at the scene. Suddenly, one of the assassins aimed at the people on the stage and fired a shot. Fang Jie immediately reacted and, in order to protect Li Zihao, he unfortunately got shot in the abdomen. Li Zihao quickly supported him, freed up one hand, aimed his gun at the assassin below the stage, and the assassin was instantly killed.
1:7:46|1:7:52|Tang Hexuan's henchmen are clearing the way ahead. With two henchmen driving, he, who has been shot, wants to escape the scene of the gunfight as soon as possible.
1:7:57|1:8:3|He escaped from the back door of the Paradise Ballroom, with [Li Zihao] guarding the back door of the ballroom to cover Tang Hexuan getting into the car. The killer quickly caught up.
1:8:10|1:8:39|[Li Zihao] threw a bomb into the ballroom, temporarily suppressing the pursuit of the assassins. Just then, the vehicle that had escorted Tang Hexuan exploded suddenly. Shocked by the explosion, [Li Zihao] tried to rush out, but was stopped by [Fang Jie]. The vehicle exploded again, engulfing the entire car in flames.
1:8:39|1:8:44|Seeing this scene, [Fang Jie] completely broke down, struggling to get up from the ground.
1:8:46|1:9:11|[Li Zihao] grabbed [Fang Jie] who was about to rush forward, with the assassin close behind. They hurriedly fled the scene and entered the alleyway of a residential building. The accompanying guards were getting fewer and fewer, with only three left so far. One of them knocked over a handcart leaning against the wall, trying to slow down the assassin's pace, but ultimately, outnumbered, the remaining few soldiers fell under the assassin's gun.
1:9:11|1:9:17|[Li Zihao] had to take action, he made [Fang Jie] lean against the wall behind him and finally shot the assassin behind him.
1:9:48|1:10:23|[Fang Jie] was hit by an assassin once again, immediately passing out on the spot. [Li Zihao] carried him and fled the scene. To escape the pursuing assassin, [Li Zihao] brought [Fang Jie] to a nearby surgical clinic by the street. As [Fang Jie] lay on the bed and opened his eyes, [Li Zihao] tore open his close-fitting shirt.
1:11:18|1:11:35|[Li Zihao] threw a punch at [Fang Jie]'s head with force, and when he saw [Fang Jie] completely pass out, he poured the remaining alcohol on [Fang Jie]'s wound, then placed a surgical knife on the alcohol lamp to sterilize it, and cut open the spot where [Fang Jie] was shot.
1:12:17|1:12:54|[Li Zihao] told her everything that happened last night. [Tang Qianqian] cried leaning against the back of the swing. [Li Zihao] just watched her from a distance, unsure of how to comfort someone who had just lost their father. In bed, [Fang Jie] gradually woke up and heard [Tang Qianqian] crying outside the window. His nose tingled with sadness, tears sliding down his cheeks.
1:12:55|1:13:20|The deafening thunder broke the silence of this extraordinary night, the rain pouring down harder and harder, countless beads falling from the sky. [Ye Qishan]'s men stood on both sides, holding umbrellas next to the manor. [Tang Qianqian] and others arranged the memorial hall for [Ye Qishan], solemn and dignified. In the middle of the hall, there was a coffin with [Ye Qishan]'s photo hanging on the wall, and a spirit tablet placed on the table.
1:13:20|1:13:49|There are some tribute fruits and tribute vegetables, with a pair of large incense candles on both sides of the hall, and many wreaths inside. [Tang Qianqian], [Li Zihao], and [Fang Jie] stood solemnly in the hall, with a blank expression. Vehicles constantly came and went outside the manor, friends from the political circle of [Tang Hexuan] came to offer their condolences. [Ma San] and others, accompanied by guards, came to the memorial hall to pay their respects to [Tang Hexuan] and then left the hall.
1:13:49|1:14:2|The Frenchman [Owen] also came to offer condolences, the pouring rain lashing the ground, water splashing, creating a misty scene with no sign of stopping, the gloomy atmosphere making it hard to breathe.
1:14:2|1:14:10|After a while, [Ye Qishan] also arrived at the manor. He furrowed his brows, looking a bit impatient, but still walked towards the inside.
1:14:10|1:14:23|In the courtyard, he met [Owen]. After a brief encounter, without saying a word, [Owen] just gave a glance at [Ye Qishan], who responded with a smile that was hard to read, then walked towards the hall of spirits.
1:14:23|1:14:36|After entering the memorial hall, he looked up at the photo hanging on the coffin, then moved the hand from behind to the front of his abdomen. After carefully examining the coffin and the photo of [Tang Hexuan], he spoke,
1:14:46|1:15:10|Ye Qishan walked towards the coffin as Fang Jie controlled his emotions. Ye Qishan forcefully pushed open the coffin lid, revealing a completely disfigured body inside.
1:15:50|1:16:24|Ye Qishan's henchmen rushed into the mourning hall upon hearing the noise, but were all knocked down by Li Zihao. Fang Jie knelt on Ye Qishan's head and knocked it on the ground three times, then continued to point a gun at his head. Ye Qishan knelt on the ground for a while, raised his head, glared angrily at Fang Jie as he stood up and straightened his clothes, let out a cold snort, then raised his voice and said,
1:16:59|1:17:13|[Ye Qishan]'s words really scared [Fang Jie], his hand holding the gun couldn't stop trembling. [Ye Qishan] said to [Li Zihao], [Ye Qishan] walked out of the funeral parlor, turned around and slapped the henchman behind him.
1:17:16|1:17:22|Then he walked out of the courtyard in the rain, got into his car, full of anger, and left the mourning scene of [Tang Hexuan].
1:17:24|1:17:43|The weather gradually cleared up, [Tang Qianqian] once again came to the church. As usual, she sat on a chair in the church, hands crossed in front of her chest, silently praying. Suddenly, a group of people outside the church rushed up with guns, knocking down the guards at the door quickly.
1:17:45|1:17:51|A group of people opened the door of the church. At this moment, [Tang Qianqian] was still silently praying. When she heard the sound, she opened her eyes.
1:19:40|1:19:58|Upon hearing Ma San's words, [Fang Jie] gradually calmed down his impulsive emotions. After a while, [Li Zihao] entered the room and started to tie up the bomb. [Fang Jie] paced around the room with a gun in his hand.
1:20:36|1:20:54|[Li Zihao] smiled, didn't reply, continued to bind the bomb, [Li Zihao] still didn't respond, bowed his head to focus on what he was doing.
1:21:7|1:21:34|Upon hearing this, [Li Zihao] stopped his actions and looked at [Fang Jie]. After speaking, [Li Zihao] forcefully threw the prepared bomb onto the wall, and the explosive package wrapped around the bomb stuck firmly to the wall.
1:21:34|1:22:3|The next day, at the upcoming election of the Chinese directors of the Public Board, [Ma San] was waiting outside the manor for [Li Zihao]. [Ma San] opened the car door for [Li Zihao], who looked at it suspiciously. Eventually, he got into the car. Inside the car, [Li Zihao] felt more and more uneasy, but he couldn't find a way out and could only pretend to be calm while looking out the window.
1:22:4|1:22:27|[Ma San] had nothing to say to [Li Zihao]. There was no communication between the two along the way. Compared to [Li Zihao]'s heavy mood, [Ma San] was very calm and composed. He leisurely smoked his cigar and gave a meaningful glance at [Li Zihao], as if hiding something. As the car drove through the city center, [Li Zihao] slowly began to notice clues while looking out the window.
1:22:29|1:22:38|After looking at the driver for a moment, he turned to [Ma San] and said,
1:22:41|1:23:15|[Li Zihao] glared at him with anger, then continued to look out the window. The car drove further and further off track, from the bustling area of Shanghai to an abandoned factory. The road outside the factory was covered with dense weeds on both sides, with remnants of rainwater on the ground. The car stopped at an open space in front of the factory building, where about thirty to forty people had gathered, each holding an axe. The leader of the group opened the door of [Ma San]'s car, and [Ma San] got out of the car.
1:23:15|1:23:24|[Li Zihao] sat in the car, [Ma San] took a puff of his cigar, adjusted his trench coat on his shoulders, and said to [Li Zihao] in the car,
1:23:56|1:24:28|[Li Zihao] got out of the car, took a deep breath, looked at [Ma San], and scanned the people around him, each of whom was holding a weapon. [Ma San] raised his head provocatively at [Li Zihao]. Faced with so many people, [Li Zihao] remained unusually calm, showing no sign of fear. [Ma San]'s men all rushed towards [Li Zihao] and surrounded him.
1:24:28|1:24:38|[Ma San] looked at [Li Zihao], feeling confident of his victory. He believed that in the current situation, even if [Li Zihao] grew wings, he wouldn't be able to escape. Inside the Paradise Ballroom, the election for the board of directors had already begun.
1:25:19|1:25:31|He didn't know that [Li Zihao] and [Fang Jie] had already seen through [Ma San]'s conspiracy. [Fang Jie] also came to the backstage and took care of the people arranged by [Ye Qishan] in the corridor. Owen was speaking at the end.
1:25:36|1:26:1|The spotlight shone on the spot where [Ye Qishan] was, and amidst the applause, [Ye Qishan] stood up, walked around the seats below, and prepared to go on stage to give a speech. As [Ye Qishan] walked up to the stage, he shook hands with the host and exchanged a brief hug with Owen. Meanwhile, [Fang Jie] continued to shuttle through the hallway for his and [Li Zihao]'s plan. He moved stealthily, cat-like, quickly towards his destination, when suddenly...
1:26:1|1:26:15|He keenly heard footsteps and quickly hid to the side. Then he slowly peeked out, and before the person could react, [Fang Jie] kicked him to the ground. The person then pulled out a gun, but [Fang Jie] quickly snatched it away and successfully retaliated.
1:26:15|1:26:28|[Fang Jie] quickly took out the bombs made by [Li Zihao] last night from his bag, stuck them in various places in the corridor, then walked to a corner of the hallway, looking up at the ceiling. On the stage, [Ye Qishan] began his speech.
1:27:1|1:27:42|The bomb exploded instantly, and the spot that was blown open happened to be where [Ye Qishan] was standing. [Ye Qishan] fell off the stage, and [Fang Jie] grabbed his collar, firing a shot at [Ye Qishan]'s leg. Only then did [Ye Qishan] reveal the location. [Ye Qishan]'s henchmen jumped down from the stage through the hole caused by the explosion. [Fang Jie] fired a shot at the explosives on the wall, successfully breaking free.
1:27:43|1:28:13|Ye Qishan's men were trying to transfer Tang Qianqian to another location, but Tang Qianqian cleverly escaped. While going downstairs, she accidentally ran into one of Ye Qishan's men. In panic, she ran to the other side. The situation on Fang Jie's side was also very tense. Ye Qishan's men kept chasing them. Fang Jie used Ye Qishan as a human shield, detonated the explosives he had set up in advance, but unfortunately was still forced into a dead end.
1:28:13|1:28:24|He threw [Ye Qishan] into the room at the end. People of [Ye Qishan] dared not rush in, shooting randomly at the door, almost injuring [Ye Qishan].
1:28:25|1:28:52|[Tang Qianqian] hid under a table, peeking out to see if [Ye Qishan]'s men had caught up. But the moment she stuck her head out, she was accidentally bumped by the pursuer. Slowly crawling out from under the table, [Ye Qishan]'s man pointed a gun at her head. Seizing the opportunity when he let his guard down, she kicked him in the groin and quickly grabbed a vase to knock him unconscious.
1:28:55|1:29:29|Fang Jie led [Ye Qishan] out of the room. The water pipes in the hallway exploded, spraying water everywhere. Fang Jie slowly backed away, walking up the stairs. Ye Qishan's men also closed in on Fang Jie, entering a room and trying to block the door with a cabinet.
1:29:34|1:29:59|At this moment, a killer sent by [Ye Qishan] broke in through the window. Fang Jie engaged in a struggle with him, as the killer held a sharp knife and gradually approached his throat. Fang Jie's arm holding the gun was completely restrained, putting him in a very disadvantageous situation. At a critical moment, he came up with a clever move, successfully escaping from the crisis with a feint. As he prepared to shoot the killer with his handgun, the gun was kicked away by the killer.
1:29:59|1:30:22|At this moment, [Ye Qishan] launched a surprise attack from behind, wielding a bottle towards him. Fang Jie managed to knock him down to the ground. The assassin got up and swung his knife at him again. The significant difference in strength made Fang Jie more and more passive as he suffered the assassin's fierce attacks. Finally, he found an opportunity to smash the assassin's head against the glass window.
1:30:22|1:30:51|[Ye Qishan] picked up the gun on the ground. Outside the door, Ye Qishan's men rushed in. He ordered the intruders to shoot at Fang Jie. Fang Jie was still confronting the assassin from earlier. Ye Qishan shot at Fang Jie's back, but Fang Jie quickly pulled the assassin in front of him, blocking Ye Qishan's bullet. At this moment, Tang Qianqian escaped from the building. She climbed along the balcony outside the high-rise, her feet slipping almost causing her to fall.
1:30:52|1:31:16|[Ye Qishan]'s men were about to catch up with her. She didn't dare to slack off, but the sign outside the building blocked her way. With no way out, she had to bravely climb behind the sign. Hiding behind it, she didn't dare to breathe. Luckily, she managed to evade [Ye Qishan]'s men. Hanging for a long time, her strength was about to run out. She struggled to turn around and tried to grab the edge of the balcony.
1:31:17|1:31:42|But [Ye Qishan]'s men grabbed her hand, [Tang Qianqian] struggled in fear, and one of [Ye Qishan]'s men fell off the building. She didn't have the strength to fall down, and at that moment [Li Zihao] grabbed her hand and pulled her back into the building. On the other side, Fang Jie was still surrounded, with [Ye Qishan]'s men closing in on him with axes in hand.
1:31:42|1:32:8|Fang Jie skillfully evaded the rules, knocking down each of Ye Qishan's men. Ye Qishan, infuriated, rushed in and fired a burst of shots at Fang Jie, but the bullets hit his own men instead. Fang Jie quickly turned around, used a sofa to shield himself from the bullets, picked up a handgun from the corner, swiftly moved to the doorway, and shot in Ye Qishan's direction, taking down several of his henchmen.
1:32:9|1:32:13|He is very likely to win against this group of people, but things don't always go as planned.
1:32:13|1:32:48|When he fired again, there were no bullets in the pistol chamber. [Ye Qishan] limped towards where Fang Jie was hiding. Fang Jie had nowhere to go. Li Zihao appeared and knocked down Ye Qishan and others. Tang Qianqian held a gun in both hands and took down the people behind her. Li Zihao threw him a gun.
1:32:51|1:33:15|Fang Jie took the gun and shot the person who had just come up. He dragged [Ye Qishan] to the room next to him. Li Zihao came to the balcony, pulled back the curtains, opened the window and looked down. He nodded towards Fang Jie. Ye Qishan's men approached the door. Fang Jie brought over a chair, and Tang Qianqian brought a hemp rope to tie Ye Qishan to the chair.
1:33:24|1:33:33|[Li Zihao] stuffed a piece of cloth into [Ye Qishan]'s mouth.
1:33:46|1:34:11|Ye Qishan desperately rammed against the door, Fang Jie threw the ignited bomb towards the door. At the moment the door was pushed open, the bomb exploded instantly. Fang Jie quickly ran towards the window, Li Zihao handed him a piece of curtain, then he grabbed Tang Qianqian's hand, held the hemp rope tied to Ye Qishan, and leaped out of the window with Ye Qishan.
1:34:19|1:34:25|[Fang Jie] and the others safely landed on the ground, while [Ye Qishan] perished in the explosion. Inside the room, a familiar figure was sitting on a chair reading a newspaper.
1:34:27|1:34:47|[Tang Hexuan] sat calmly in the chair, feeling particularly relieved when he saw the news of [Ye Qishan] hiring a hitman in the newspaper.
1:34:48|1:34:55|At night, Li Zihao drove away from the manor with Fang Jie still sitting in the car.
1:34:58|1:35:23|Facing Fang Jie's question, Li Zihao fell into contemplation. He was also very puzzled, not knowing why Fusheng called the two of them. They drove to the address provided by Fusheng, which was an abandoned factory. There were guards with guns scattered around the factory, and a bonfire lit with discarded oil drums on the open ground. Fang Jie and Li Zihao got out of the car one after another, and they saw Tang Qianqian sitting not far away.
1:35:24|1:35:33|[Li Zihao] looked surprised, but [Fang Jie] was very happy.
1:35:43|1:35:52|[Li Zihao] stood frozen in place, unable to believe that [Tang Hexuan] was still alive.
1:35:54|1:36:13|Upon hearing Tang Hexuan's words, Li Zihao looked up at the person hanging not far away. The person was hung up by the waist, and Li Zihao couldn't see the face clearly. He took a few steps forward. After seeing the person's face, he couldn't help but gasp in shock. The woman hanging there was covered in blood.
1:36:13|1:36:30|But [Li Zihao] still recognized her, his beloved [Lan Ruoyun] looked at [Lan Ruoyun], her eyes filled with fear and helplessness, trembling all over.
1:36:51|1:37:0|Fu Sheng handed over the files he had investigated and organized to [Li Zihao], but Li Zihao did not take them. His expression at that moment revealed a sense of panic.
1:37:15|1:37:36|[Li Zihao] didn't know how to respond. He looked at [Lan Ruoyun] hanging there, tears filling his eyes. [Li Zihao] avoided her gaze.
1:38:2|1:38:10|Lan Ruoyun descended from mid-air,
1:38:25|1:39:5|[Tang Qianqian] got up and walked over to [Lan Ruoyun], then squatted down next to her. [Lan Ruoyun] had empty eyes and uncontrollable body spasms. Seeing no response from [Lan Ruoyun], [Tang Qianqian] stood up. [Li Zihao] looked at [Lan Ruoyun] on the ground with heartache. At this moment, he couldn't do anything, his mind was in chaos, he had never felt so helpless before, completely unsure of what to do.
1:39:10|1:39:35|Tang Qianqian's words deeply pierced him, leaving him in a dilemma. Furrowing his brows and hanging his head, his legs felt unusually heavy as if filled with lead, making it difficult to move forward. After mentally preparing himself, he lifted his legs and walked slowly towards Lan Ruoyun. The further he walked, the more his heart ached.
1:39:36|1:40:8|Approaching [Lan Ruoyun], he knelt down weakly, watching her being tortured beyond recognition. His eyes turned red instantly. Carefully, he untied her hands bound by hemp ropes. Her once pristine and slender fingers were now filthy, covered in mud and blood. [Li Zihao]'s hands trembled involuntarily. He felt both heartbroken and careful as he helped [Lan Ruoyun] up from the ground.
1:40:8|1:40:26|Leaning on his own arm, [Lan Ruoyun] watched as tears uncontrollably streamed down, [Li Zihao] reached out a hand, tremblingly caressing [Lan Ruoyun]'s face. He was extremely remorseful, hating himself for not freeing [Lan Ruoyun] earlier, and couldn't help but softly sob.
1:40:33|1:40:56|Upon hearing Lan Ruoyun's words, Li Zihao buried his head and started crying. Fang Jie, not far away, also silently shed tears upon witnessing this scene. Tang Qianqian, on the other hand, remained indifferent, still difficult to fathom. Li Zihao was heartbroken to the extreme. Lan Ruoyun exerted her last bit of strength to break free from Li Zihao's embrace and took the opportunity to grab his gun, pointing it at...
1:40:56|1:41:4|Aiming at her own head, the bullet pierced through her skull.
1:41:5|1:41:35|Fang Jie was so frightened by the scene in front of him that his body trembled involuntarily. [Li Zihao] watched as [Lan Ruoyun] slowly fell to the ground, his eyes widened, finding it hard to accept what had just happened. He tried hard to suppress his emotions, turning his back to Tang Hexuan, looking at [Lan Ruoyun]'s body, not allowing himself to cry out in pain. Throughout the whole process, Tang Hexuan didn't even glance at him. He just let out a long breath from his nostrils and then left the scene.
1:41:35|1:41:52|Li Zihao and several subordinates also left with Fu Sheng. Li Zihao couldn't help but cry as he kept looking at Lan Ruoyun's face. The next morning, it started raining again in Shanghai. A gasoline drum containing Lan Ruoyun's body was pushed into the deep sea.
1:42:40|1:43:6|[Li Zihao] arrived at the meeting point with Mr. Luo by boat. As soon as he got off the boat, a group of gunmen rushed out of the house, quickly surrounding him from all sides. Seeing the situation turning bad, the boatman swiftly sailed away from the scene. Mr. Luo inside the house had already been captured, covered in blood and hanging from the ceiling beam. Tang Hexuan walked out of the house, followed by [Fang Jie].
1:43:6|1:43:12|[Li Zihao] saw that it was Tang Hexuan, and his eyes instantly turned red with anger as he glared at Tang Hexuan.
1:43:47|1:44:2|Tang Hexuan pointed to [Fang Jie] behind him. [Fang Jie] lowered his head to look at the materials in his hand, sighed, then brought them to [Li Zihao]. Without even looking at them, [Li Zihao] took the materials from him and threw them on the ground.
1:44:5|1:44:14|Tang Hexuan glanced disdainfully and then turned to Fang Jie behind him, saying to Li Zihao, "..."
1:44:16|1:44:26|He knew that the two had a close relationship, and he continued to speak while supporting [Fang Jie]'s shoulder.
1:44:40|1:45:6|[Fang Jie] looked expressionless at the ground, just like the situation he and [Li Zihao] were in that night. He was also caught in a dilemma, not knowing how to make a choice. He pondered Tang Hexuan's words, but in the end, he took out a gun from his pocket and aimed it at his brother [Li Zihao], with whom he had once shared life and death. This was a scene that [Fang Jie] had never imagined.
1:46:41|1:47:8|Hearing what [Li Zihao] said, he shook his head and said, then closed his eyes and pulled the trigger, firing several shots towards [Li Zihao]'s body. [Li Zihao] fell into the river behind him. [Fang Jie] looked at the blood on the water's surface and burst into tears. [Li Zihao]'s body gradually sank.
1:47:10|1:47:19|[Tang Hexuan] is listening to a play in a theater. There are no other guests in the spacious theater, only [Tang Hexuan]'s entourage.
1:47:30|1:47:42|[Tang Hexuan] watched the people on the stage singing opera while casually asking Fusheng. Fusheng's expression turned heavy when he heard it, and he didn't answer quickly. At that moment, a loud thunder resounded through the sky.
1:47:44|1:48:7|Raindrops beat down on the ground, a pair of hands covered in mud climbed up the shore, followed by a head poking out. Three children on the roadside saw this scene, and they seemed to recognize the person who had just climbed out of the river and quickly ran to his side, dragging him onto the shore. A bolt of lightning pierced through the pitch-black night, revealing that the man dragged onto the shore was [Li Zihao].
1:48:7|1:48:11|Zihao, Fusheng in the theater has been shot and fallen to the ground.
1:48:11|1:48:47|He was also a member of the Blue Clothing Society. The assassin poured a cup of tea on the unconscious Fusheng. Inside the room, a woman was helping [Li Zihao] remove the bullets from his body and bandage his wounds with gauze. There was no dry spot on [Li Zihao]'s body, covered in water and sweat, whether from rain or pain. He lifted his heavy eyelids drowsily and saw [Tang Qianqian] looking at him anxiously.
1:48:48|1:48:54|He tightly held Tang Qianqian's hand, and tears instantly welled up in her eyes as she saw him regain consciousness.
1:48:54|1:49:28|[Li Zihao] looked at [Tang Qianqian] with a strong desire to say something to her, but being seriously injured, he couldn't muster any strength. [Tang Qianqian] could only hold his hand silently shedding tears. After the morning turmoil, [Fang Jie] drove back to the manor. Once the car stopped, he sat inside calming his emotions. He knew he had to face it eventually.
1:49:29|1:49:36|But when he reached the downstairs, he hesitated and dared not walk into the hall. He didn't know how to face [Tang Hexuan].
1:49:37|1:49:45|He knew clearly that the shots he fired at Li Zihao in the morning all avoided vital points, which were far from enough to take Li Zihao's life.
1:49:45|1:49:57|He took a deep breath, as if to bolster himself, then walked into the hall and eventually arrived at the door of Tang Hexuan's study. With his hands gripping the door handle, he nervously pushed open the door.
1:50:2|1:50:10|His heart was in a panic, not daring to look up at [Tang Hexuan], trying hard to control his legs, slowly walking towards [Tang Hexuan]'s desk.
1:52:7|1:52:22|[Tang Hexuan]'s trusted killer fired several shots at [Fang Jie]. [Tang Hexuan] remained expressionless as he watched [Fang Jie] fall in front of him. The next day's headline in the morning paper read that the Blue Clothing Society had been completely wiped out.
1:52:35|1:52:52|Tang Qianqian, sitting across the dining table, shed tears upon hearing this. Tang Hexuan, setting aside the newspaper in his hand, picked up the coffee beside him.
1:53:10|1:53:22|[Tang Hexuan] was at a loss for words when he heard his daughter say this.
1:53:24|1:53:50|At night, [Tang Qianqian] went to treat the wound for [Li Zihao]. By this time, [Li Zihao]'s body had mostly recovered, but his eyes were filled with hatred. Carrying a basin of water, [Tang Qianqian] walked over. She knew that all of [Li Zihao]'s current hatred stemmed from her own father, but she had already fallen completely in love with [Li Zihao] and had to betray her father. She took out a pair of scissors and cut the bandages wrapped around [Li Zihao]'s waist.
1:53:50|1:53:58|Tenderly watching the bullet wound on his chest, I reattached the gauze with medicine and he kept lying to me.
1:54:41|1:54:56|[Li Zihao], filled with anger, finished speaking these words, suddenly realizing it was too cruel for [Tang Qianqian], and immediately changed his tone.
1:55:20|1:55:26|[Li Zihao] looks at [Tang Qianqian]. He furrows his brows, silent, while [Tang Qianqian] gazes back at him with determination.
1:55:31|1:55:58|On the bustling dock, [Tang Qianqian] anxiously waits for [Li Zihao] with her luggage in hand. She can't help but rub her hands together, pacing back and forth, glancing at the time on her wristwatch. However, amidst the crowd on the dock, there is still no sign of [Li Zihao]. The time they agreed upon has passed, and the ship bound for England is about to depart. [Tang Qianqian] remains in place, waiting for [Li Zihao].
1:55:58|1:56:15|Tears uncontrollably streamed down her face, [Li Zihao] still hadn't shown up, leaving her feeling uneasy. [Li Zihao] was driving fast, but at this moment, he wasn't heading to the pier where he had promised to meet [Tang Qianqian], but to [Tang Hexuan]'s mansion.
1:56:23|1:56:31|He crashed into the guard at the entrance, then broke through the iron gate and shot the scattered people in the yard.
1:56:38|1:57:3|Li Zihao violently turned the steering wheel to crash open the door of the hall, then rushed into the hall with a gun in both hands, quickly taking out several guards who rushed out of the hall. Immediately, another group of people appeared, holding submachine guns and shooting directly at [Li Zihao]. In the midst of the gunfire, [Li Zihao] showed no fear at all. With bloodlust in his eyes, he threw away the gun in his hand, kicked a guard into the air, and then snatched the knife from him.
1:57:3|1:57:31|Approaching the guard holding a gun, [Li Zihao] swiftly chopped at him, grabbed the gun from the guard's hand, flipped and fell to the ground, quickly positioning himself in the blind spot of the guard with the rifle, and accurately shot him in the chest without deviation. While the guard was still standing, he strode towards him, snatched the rifle from his hand, and sprayed the other guards in the hall with a round of gunfire.
1:57:49|1:58:2|The assassin at the stairs saw that Li Zihao did not move, they all stuck their heads out, aiming at the spot where he disappeared. Just then, a figure rushed out from the corner, and the guards started shooting at the figure. To their surprise, the figure was not Li Zihao, but a guard who had already died.
1:58:2|1:58:9|[Li Zihao] successfully attracted the attention of the guards upstairs with this move, and took the opportunity to rush out and knock down those people while the guards were distracted.
1:58:9|1:58:22|Quickly arriving at the second floor where [Tang Qianqian] was, just as he was about to approach the study, [Tang Qianqian]'s trusted assassin appeared. He threw the knife in his hand towards [Li Zihao], but [Li Zihao] successfully dodged it, and the two sides began to engage in a confrontation.
1:58:22|1:58:44|At first, [Tang Qianqian]'s skilled assassin had the upper hand, swiftly attacking with the knife in hand, each strike getting closer to [Li Zihao]'s vital points. However, [Li Zihao] did not back down, skillfully avoiding the danger. In the midst of the fight, [Li Zihao] accidentally fell to the first floor. Pang Hexuan's skilled assassin, holding a sharp knife, leaped from the second floor and stabbed towards [Li Zihao]. [Li Zihao] quickly got up and dodged that fatal strike.
1:58:44|1:59:4|Still not fully recovered, the assassin quickly swung his knife towards him. He kept retreating, narrowly escaping death several times at the hands of the assassin. However, Li Zihao did not give up easily. He picked up a bookshelf and smashed it towards the assassin. As the assassin got up, he charged towards Li Zihao again, aiming his knife at Li Zihao's head. This time, Li Zihao did not back down at all, choosing to face the enemy head-on and fight to the end.
1:59:4|1:59:25|He grabbed the assassin's blade with all his strength, and the assassin pushed the blade towards him. As it was about to reach his neck, the scene suddenly reversed, and the blade gradually changed direction, stabbing the assassin in the stomach. [Li Zihao] effortlessly pushed him to the edge of the table. Unexpectedly, the assassin refused to give up and quickly grabbed a bottle of wine to smash towards [Li Zihao].
1:59:25|1:59:38|[Li Zihao] let the bottle hit his head, then grabbed the assassin and slammed him down on the table. He grabbed the assassin's face with one hand and forcefully smashed it against the ground several times, covering the assassin's mouth and nose with his palm, suffocating him to death.
1:59:38|1:59:52|He entered the study where [Tang Hexuan] was located, blasted open the door, and sprayed bullets towards where [Tang Hexuan] was sitting. The study was instantly in chaos. He walked to the center of the study, looked at [Tang Hexuan]'s body, and said,
2:0:3|2:0:11|He then fired several shots towards [Tang Hexuan]'s position, blood flowing down his arm onto the floor, blood also trickling from the corner of his mouth.
2:0:11|2:0:34|Following a tear falling down, it was evident from the exposed skin that the person severely injured by the bullet was clearly not [Tang Hexuan], but [Li Zihao] was completely unaware. When the hat fell off, he finally realized that the person was not [Tang Hexuan], but [Tang Qianqian] who had invited him to the dock. He immediately dropped the gun, lifted [Tang Qianqian] onto the desk, and tearfully looked at her.
2:0:34|2:0:43|This is something he never expected,
2:0:52|2:1:20|[Li Zihao] is in extreme pain at this moment, not knowing what to do but to hold [Tang Qianqian] in his arms.
2:1:49|2:2:20|After saying that, [Tang Qianqian] completely collapsed into [Li Zihao]'s arms. Tears mixed with sweat from the previous fight stuck to his dusty face. He held [Tang Qianqian] tightly, leaning his head on her shoulder. Tears fell drop by drop, his body trembling involuntarily. He was filled with guilt towards [Tang Qianqian]. Perhaps if he had followed their agreement to meet at the pier before 9 a.m. instead of being here, none of this would have happened.
2:2:22|2:2:56|[Li Zihao] walked out of the study carrying the body of [Tang Qianqian], all the way to the courtyard of the manor. He passed through the courtyard filled with bodies and arrived at the entrance of the manor. At the entrance, a group of dozens of armed men stood in formation. Upon seeing [Li Zihao], the men in the middle parted ways, revealing [Ye Qishan] behind them. [Ye Qishan] remained as calm and composed as ever, slowly walking forward.
2:2:56|2:3:14|Seeing his beloved daughter fall into the arms of [Li Zihao], the man who only cared about power and killing finally showed some sadness. However, even in his grief, he did not spare [Li Zihao]. As the man behind [Tang Hexuan] raised a gun and pulled the trigger.
2:3:20|2:3:30|[Li Zihao] was shot multiple times in the chest, with bullets piercing through. The pain quickly spread throughout his body, but he still tightly held onto [Tang Qianqian] as he slowly knelt down on the ground.
2:3:30|2:4:3|[Tang Hexuan] looked at his daughter [Tang Qianqian], hearing the sound of her singing on the swing in his ears. He walked closer and looked at [Tang Qianqian]'s pale face, feeling as if his heart had been pricked by countless needles, lost in sorrow.
2:4:4|2:4:29|Gritting his teeth tightly to control his emotions, Li Zihao thought that by getting rid of anyone who posed a threat to him, he could confidently become the chairman of the Shanghai Public Board of Directors in the French Concession, and enjoy the pleasure that power brings. However, he lost his beloved daughter. He looked up at the sky, then closed his eyes in despair for several days.
2:4:29|2:4:31|The election of the [Public Affairs Bureau] begins again.
