0:1:19|0:1:26|With a loud noise, the scene shifts to the human experiment base at the IPT Research Institute on the English Island.
0:1:39|0:1:42|Cover up the truth of the explosion at the IPT research institute.
0:1:47|0:1:56|In this setting, the scene shifts to an office where [Cui Hu], played by Huo Jianhua, is bowing his head, while a foreigner across from him speaks.
0:2:0|0:2:3|[Cui Hu] slowly lifted his head, looking at the other person with a determined gaze.
0:2:36|0:2:52|The story is about to unfold. The film mainly tells the story of a single mother, portrayed by Yang Mi, [Xia Tian], who is a senior researcher at the Institute of Physics. She and Long, played by Jin Shijie, the [Director], work together to develop a technology that allows living organisms to travel through wormholes for time travel.
0:2:53|0:3:3|When there was a breakthrough in the research, Zhang Yipeng played the son [Dou Dou] of [Xia Tian], but was kidnapped by [Cui Hu]. [Cui Hu] threatened [Xia Tian] with [Dou Dou]'s life to hand over the particle technology.
0:3:3|0:3:15|In order to save [Dou Dou]'s life, [Xia Tian] takes a risk and uses the unfinished particle technology to go back one hour and fifty minutes. However, due to repeated failures, [Xia Tian] crosses multiple times, making things even more complicated.
0:3:15|0:3:26|He encounters unexpected challenges and must confront the mutants in his time travel, engaging in a fierce battle with them. Meanwhile, the backstory of the kidnapper [Cui Hu] gradually emerges.
0:3:30|0:3:33|Continuing to tell you about the positive part.
0:3:33|0:3:53|Inside the Linkage Research Institute, numerous particles are gathering inside the transporter. [Xia Tian] and colleagues are busy at the control panel around the data table. The director is watching the imaging of the apes on the data table. Several people stop their actions and turn towards the central data table. Colleague Huang Chen covers her mouth, while [Da Xiong] clenches his fists.
0:4:13|0:4:20|Everyone was still immersed in the joy of the successful experiment. [Director] placed the data screen into the data platform, and the platform automatically received it.
0:4:29|0:4:50|[Xia Tian] and [Cui Hu] both put their hands together in front of their mouths. [Xia Tian] visibly relaxed, while [Cui Hu] was extremely pleased. He even bowed his head and jumped a little with a file in his arms. [Huang Chen] happily waved his arms, [Da Xiong] scratched his head and clapped along with everyone. Then, everyone prepared to leave the database, and the screen faded to black.
0:4:50|0:5:6|Turning to the cliffs of several high mountains. [Xia Tian] is climbing with his son [Dou Dou], [Xia Tian] is ascending with the grooves, [Dou Dou] leans over and looks down. The two have climbed to a very high position, with some shorter mountains in full view.
0:5:17|0:5:28|[Xia Tian] turned around and took two steps upward again. His index finger and ring finger were still wrapped in anti-slip tape. His phone vibrated, and [Xia Tian] took it out from the pocket at his waist to answer the call.
0:5:36|0:5:48|[Xia Tian] just hung up the phone when suddenly [Dou Dou]'s rope broke. [Xia Tian] quickly undid his own harness, [Dou Dou] chased after him, and the ground revealed an electronic grid under his pressure.
0:6:2|0:6:4|Following behind, [Xia Tian] looks at [Dou Dou] with concern.
0:6:17|0:6:27|The virtual climbing scene gradually disappears, and the scene returns to [Xia Tian]'s home. Afterwards, [Xia Tian] drives across a high bridge spanning the sea and arrives at the research institute on Azure Island.
0:6:37|0:6:58|[Xia Tian], who changed out of her sportswear, was dressed in formal attire and carrying a handbag as she walked through the lobby of the research institute. She nodded to colleagues as she walked up the stairs and then entered the elevator. As the elevator ascended, the exterior of the entire research institute could be seen. After a short incline, the elevator went straight up to the conference room located high above.
0:7:1|0:7:8|In the meeting room, the research team of 5 people sat in a row facing the electronic screen. Sitting in the center was [Chairman of the Board].
0:7:56|0:7:59|The lights of the particle transporter turned on, explained [Xia Tian].
0:9:35|0:9:45|The car started slowly, with [Xia Tian] following behind a car that was driving away. Suddenly, a man threw himself onto the front windshield of the car.
0:9:56|0:10:9|The man was pulling the door while driving, shouting loudly towards [Xia Tian]. Suddenly, a large amount of blood gushed out of the man's mouth, spraying onto the car window. [Xia Tian] was shocked and slammed on the brakes. Security personnel arrived shortly after.
0:10:11|0:10:15|[Xia Tian] shook his head and asked the security team leader.
0:10:32|0:10:45|[Xia Tian] turned around with furrowed brows, walked towards the car, and glanced back a few times as he walked. By the time he got home, it was already late in the evening. As he entered the house, the sound of a cartoon was coming from the television.
0:11:4|0:11:14|[Xia Tian] walked into the living room and saw that [Dou Dou] was already asleep on the sofa, holding a toy in his arms. [Xia Tian] looked at [Dou Dou], let out a sigh, and then turned to the television.
0:11:20|0:11:36|He picked up the remote control from the coffee table, turned off the TV, then bent down to take the toy from [Dou Dou]'s arms and put it aside. With one hand around [Dou Dou]'s back and the other supporting his bottom, he lifted [Dou Dou] into his arms, and after holding him securely, he even patted [Dou Dou]'s head.
0:11:36|0:11:46|Back in the bedroom, [Dou Dou] was already fast asleep on the bed. [Xia Tian] looked at the painting [Dou Dou] had done today, depicting a mother and child standing under a rainbow, with "I Love Mom" written in English next to it.
0:11:49|0:12:3|After saying those words, [Xia Tian] also lay down on the bed, one hand resting beside her face, the other gently touching [Dou Dou]'s cheek, brushing his hair, and lightly kissing his forehead. The screen fades to black.
0:12:7|0:12:13|[Cui Hu] stood on the opposite side of the Azure Island, smoking a cigarette, the scar on his face not completely healed, still visible.
0:12:15|0:12:28|And on the terrace of the research institute he was gazing at, some staff members were busy with their own tasks. At this moment, [Xia Tian] walked through the terrace carrying a bag, entered the glass door, and greeted the colleague who was coming towards her with a light smile.
0:12:29|0:12:38|A pair of maintenance workers, led by a man in a suit, walked past him. The man in the suit glanced at [Xia Tian] before turning back and pressing his earpiece.
0:12:38|0:12:52|The group of people arrived at the underground research institute. Xia Tian stood under a monitor, and as he operated his phone, the monitor turned towards the wall. Then, Xia Tian gestured towards the back, and the maintenance team walked in orderly.
0:12:52|0:13:0|The man in a suit looked down through the grid cover on the ground, only to see the maintenance team had already walked down the stairs to the lower level.
0:13:0|0:13:14|The maintenance team arrived at the lower level of the room full of pipes. Several people started to act around, taking out small disc-shaped bombs and installing them in various places. One person waved his hand, and his partner tied the rope with a bag and lowered it down. After finishing one installation, [Director], everyone has been conducting clinical experiments these days.
0:13:42|0:13:46|Later, [Xia Tian] and [Cui Hu] walked into the teleportation room.
0:15:43|0:15:49|The two walked around the teleporter. [Xia Tian] laughed and dodged the topic, while [Cui Hu] put his hand into the pocket of his suit.
0:16:11|0:16:22|[Xia Tian] looked around, opened the cloth bag, and glanced at [Chief], who smiled without saying a word. [Xia Tian] took out something from inside, which was a watch. After talking with [Chief], [Xia Tian] and [Da Xiong] went to the laboratory, where they saw Xiangdong looking through a microscope and reacted after being photographed.
0:16:39|0:16:43|[Xia Tian] moved to the microscope and explained to [Cui Hu].
0:16:58|0:17:1|[Da Xiong] looked at Xia Tian inserting data to the east and asked.
0:17:29|0:17:32|Looking east at the departing [Xia Tian], then turning to face the opposite direction.
0:17:35|0:17:54|The two of them left the laboratory together. On the screen, two monkeys were shown, one on the left and one on the right. Suddenly, the one on the right started moving, swinging its arms up and down. The camera then turned to [Xia Tian], who had just put down a cup of coffee. The screen in front of him showed [Xia Tian], the chief researcher, undergoing regular self-defense training, focusing on shooting.
0:17:55|0:18:8|She looked at the paper materials in her hand while sliding the display screen. At this moment, her phone rang, and seeing it was a call from [Dou Dou], [Xia Tian] smiled and cast the screen to the display. [Dou Dou] asked.
0:18:32|0:18:48|[Xia Tian] looked at the coffee in his hand and then set it down. On the screen, [Dou Dou] was dragged out of the frame. [Xia Tian] called out to the screen.
0:18:57|0:19:7|[Xia Tian] turned around and ran out, driving home in a hurry while making a phone call. She didn't notice that she was already sandwiched between two cars.
0:19:11|0:19:27|The SUV behind suddenly accelerated and crashed into the rear of Xia Tian's car. Xia Tian was pushed forward by the force, quickly turned around to look back, but the car behind was still closely following. Xia Tian turned the steering wheel, preparing to overtake the truck in front. Unexpectedly, the truck also turned the steering wheel.
0:19:27|0:19:44|When in front of him, and the car behind caught up again, hitting the rear of [Xia Tian]'s car once more, [Xia Tian]'s head knocked against the steering wheel. He covered his forehead and looked back, only to find the off-road vehicle continuously hitting the rear of the car. [Xia Tian] tried to overtake through the gap, but was still blocked by the truck.
0:19:45|0:20:1|Like this, the off-road vehicle was pushing against the rear of [Xia Tian]'s car, and suddenly the backboard of the truck in front opened and then dropped down. [Xia Tian] had to slam on the brakes, the board fell to the ground, and [Xia Tian]'s car was pushed into the truck's compartment. The truck's backboard was slowly retracted, and [Xia Tian] shouted in panic.
0:20:7|0:20:19|The carriage was pitch black, suddenly, a big light turned on, and [Xia Tian] called out. A man was lying on the hood of the car, another man was standing, both observing [Xia Tian], who also turned to look at them.
0:20:19|0:20:24|At this moment, [Cui Hu] walked towards the car. With the light shining on his face, [Xia Tian] could only squint his eyes, and he saw [Dou Dou].
0:20:39|0:20:47|[Xia Tian] couldn't push the door open. [Cui Hu] turned around and patted [Dou Dou]'s head.
0:21:5|0:21:9|After [Cui Hu] gestured, his subordinate picked up the briefcase and approached. [Cui Hu] then continued speaking.
0:21:32|0:21:44|He watched as [Dou Dou] froze when the bomb was injected, while [Cui Hu] pointed at the watch and pressed the timer. The woman with a crew cut took [Dou Dou] away.
0:21:59|0:22:2|[Dou Dou] looked at his mom in the car and shouted loudly again.
0:22:8|0:22:17|[Xia Tian] tightly grips the steering wheel, biting her lip. Then, the scene cuts back to the laboratory, where [Cui Hu] is analyzing data. [Cui Hu] hears a noise and turns around.
0:22:26|0:22:35|At this moment, [Xia Tian] has already returned to the research institute. He looked up at the central control room and called [Xiang Dong]. [Xiang Dong] looked at the data and answered the phone.
0:22:42|0:22:56|[Xia Tian] ran while hanging up the phone, rushed through the terrace into the hall, bumped into people without dodging, and pushed them aside directly. Among them was the man in a suit carrying a bomb. The man in the suit turned his head and watched [Xia Tian] enter a door.
0:22:58|0:23:17|[Xia Tian] ran up to the second floor of the analysis room, slowed down her pace, and after a moment of daze, she sat down on the ground in a daze. She first felt a sense of confusion, then covered her mouth with her hand, dry heaved, and only then did her emotions catch up. Her eyes were already wet with tears, and she looked around in terror, covering her mouth and not daring to make a sound.
0:23:17|0:23:23|And in front of her, lying in a pool of blood, was [Xia Tian], who crawled forward and gently pushed Dong to the side.
0:23:25|0:23:38|A ball rolled out, making [Xia Tian] jump back in fright. The noise caught his attention, and he looked around anxiously, only to see someone approaching for a meeting on the other side. Realizing no one noticed him, [Xia Tian] let out a sigh of relief.
0:23:38|0:23:52|Inside the round ball on the ground was an eyeball, and [Xia Tian] reached out to grab it. As he got closer, he closed his eyes in pain, turned his head away, and his hand trembled uncontrollably at the side. Finally, he frowned and picked it up.
0:23:56|0:24:9|[Xia Tian] was startled by the sudden vibration of his phone, and he quickly looked around in panic. He answered the phone and heard [Huang Chen] urging him on the other end. At that moment, [Huang Chen] walked into the first floor.
0:24:27|0:24:32|[Xia Tian] got up from the ground, looked around, and then fixed his gaze on the mirror on the table.
0:25:0|0:25:3|[Xia Tian] stood on the stairs and took over the file wall.
0:25:16|0:25:30|Watching [Huang Chen] walk down the stairs, [Xia Tian] leaned against the railing and hurried up the stairs. Every two steps, a phone rang. Glancing down, [Xia Tian] saw [Huang Chen] answering the phone, so she could only wave her hand to urge him on.
0:25:34|0:25:47|Watching [Huang Chen] leave, [Xia Tian] looked up at the filing cabinet. Then, he held the eyeball in one hand and used his suit to cover it, hurriedly went downstairs, but accidentally knocked over someone else's folder. He pushed through the crowd and bumped into a woman with a cart, prompting a colleague to ask.
0:25:49|0:25:57|[Xia Tian] winced in pain, but still waved his hand. After speaking, he brightly ran off. Not long after, [Chief] appeared behind him, "What are you doing here, [Xia Tian]?"
0:26:15|0:26:23|[Captain] was stunned for a moment upon hearing this, then turned around and the two of them arrived at the data room. [Captain] stared at the recognizer, and after it finished identifying, he spoke.
0:26:26|0:26:30|The departing [Director] turned around and asked.
0:26:48|0:27:2|After Director [Suo Zhang] left, [Xia Tian] took out an eyeball from his pocket, held it in front of the scanner with both hands, and the display above showed that the iris recognition of the three individuals had been completed. Soon, the data key was generated and popped out from the checkpoint.
0:27:9|0:27:29|[Xia Tian] breathed a sigh of relief, took the key and quickly entered the data room. Stepping onto the central console while holding onto the railing, she inserted the key and swiftly started inputting. As one loading was completed, she removed the key and continued inputting on the other side, until the main screen displayed that four sets of data had been loaded, reaching the final step.
0:27:30|0:27:37|[Xia Tian] reached out and raised his hand, entering information on the screen above. After completing it, he watched the loading progress slowly reach 10%.
0:27:39|0:28:0|Meanwhile, [Huang Chen], who had obtained the information, returned to the analysis room. Walking up to the second floor, [Huang Chen] found no one there. Pouting, she sighed and walked towards the table, shaking her head. [Huang Chen] noticed something had been crushed underfoot, and as she bent down to look, she saw a syringe. Just as she raised her head, she caught sight of the bloodstains under the nearby filing cabinet.
0:28:2|0:28:19|On the other side, [Xia Tian] was inputting data according to the procedure, while anxiously checking the watch. In the analysis room, [Huang Chen] had already arrived in front of the filing cabinet. As he opened the cabinet door, he was shocked and sat on the ground. Suddenly, the alarm in the research institute went off, and the alert sound rang out.
0:28:40|0:28:56|Here, the security has just arrived at the analysis room, while [Xia Tian] is anxiously waiting in the data room, with his hands clasped together in a running stance. Inside the analysis room, a security officer questions [Huang Chen], who weakly shakes his head, but the security officer detects information about [Xia Tian].
0:29:8|0:29:17|In the office, [Da Xiong] hears the name of [Xia Tian] and looks up. The head of security has already arrived at the office of [Director]. [Director] stands up in surprise.
0:29:24|0:29:26|The same researcher died after being injected with PTX.
0:29:53|0:29:56|[Xia Tian] was analyzing the data module when he was stopped by [Da Xiong].
0:30:30|0:30:34|Da Xiong was actually protecting Xia Tian, hiding in the recess of a pillar.
0:30:47|0:30:55|[Da Xiong] tightly held onto [Xia Tian]'s arm, deep in thought. Suddenly, his gaze shifted to the ventilation duct at his feet, while the security outside seemed to have noticed something.
0:30:56|0:31:15|He took two steps and said to the subordinate searching over there. The security subordinate turned around and came to the door, the sensor door opened automatically. He walked in with a gun and found someone immediately took two steps fast, while [Da Xiong] raised his hands and asked back.
0:31:25|0:31:45|[Xia Tian] was squatting in the ventilation duct with a data module in hand. He moved along the duct and arrived at the other end. Jumping out of the ventilation duct, [Xia Tian] fell to the ground. To leave the research institute, one must pass through the lobby, where security guards were evacuating the crowd near the elevator.
0:31:45|0:31:49|[Xia Tian] ran towards the elevator on her floor, but ran into two security guards.
0:31:53|0:32:20|[Xia Tian] tightly held the data module in his arms, while two security guards suddenly got shot and fell to the ground. [Xia Tian] anxiously looked at the two on the ground and then slightly turned his head to see the security guards in the hall behind him already prepared with guns. However, on the display screen at the elevator entrance, [Xia Tian] saw the security guards waiting for him and the experimental samples left on the cart in front of him gave him an idea. He pushed the cart and pressed the elevator button.
0:32:23|0:32:40|The man in a suit who just helped out is hiding behind, reporting on the whereabouts of [Xia Tian]. [Xia Tian], who entered the elevator, took out a bottle from the cart drawer, opened it and poured the powder into the basin, then unscrewed the cap of the liquid bottle and poured it in. The two substances reacted chemically, quickly producing white mist.
0:32:40|0:32:47|[Xia Tian] covered his mouth and nose with his arm, fanned himself, and continued to add medicine inside. The head of security team looked at his actions with confusion.
0:33:15|0:33:19|The sudden explosion, accompanied by a cold white smoke, [Xia Tian] took the opportunity to run out of the elevator.
0:33:29|0:33:46|[Xia Tian] ran out of the lobby, facing the door on the corridor, finally finding one that was not locked. He immediately pushed the door open and ran out, leaving the security guards who caught up looking at the empty corridor, with their hands clasped together to split up and search ahead. By this time, [Xia Tian] had already climbed onto a protruding triangular roof outside.
0:33:46|0:34:0|He is climbing up the ladder, and after reaching the top, [Xia Tian] observes the security guards in the corridor. When a guard turns around, he quickly pulls back. After confirming the guard has passed, he carefully walks towards the narrow rooftop and heads to the garbage chute.
0:34:2|0:34:17|One slip of the foot scared him, causing him to quickly lie down, stabilize himself, cover his chest, breathe slowly, and then continue walking forward. When he reached the processing port, he slid sideways down, not stopping at the window above the processing port, but sliding into the processing pipeline.
0:34:17|0:34:30|With a huge impact, he turned his head and used his arms to block the garbage, all the pipes leading to the central shredder. [Xia Tian] had just come out of the pipe. He quickly reached out to grab the nearby roller. After sliding a short distance, he finally caught the roller.
0:34:31|0:34:47|The data module in hand slipped and rolled down. [Xia Tian] watched as the data module stopped on the table less than half a meter away, while Xue continued to shovel garbage down. She clung to the iron pipe between the rollers, using all four limbs to move upwards towards the data module on the other side.
0:34:47|0:34:56|[Xia Tian] moved slowly in a difficult position, with constantly rolling garbage bags around, posing a danger. As she looked up, a garbage bag flew towards her.
0:34:57|0:35:8|[Xia Tian] was hit head-on and was dragged into the garbage headfirst. As he approached the platform, he grabbed the wheel with all his strength, and the ruler tip was nailed right in front of him.
0:35:8|0:35:24|He took a deep breath, switched to his left hand to grab the wheel, and used his right hand, which was closer, to grab the data module. Once he got closer, he would be hit by the sharp ruler. [Xia Tian] disregarded everything and crawled towards the data module step by step. [Xia Tian] leaned his body, the tendons in his hands all bulging.
0:35:25|0:35:36|Finally, [Xia Tian] grabbed the data module, his left hand still holding the scroll wheel. He turned over the nearby screen to catch his breath, while not far away, [Da Xiong] was still tirelessly shoveling garbage.
0:35:38|0:35:55|On the other side of the research institute, [Cui Hu] and others were waiting. [Dou Dou] sat on the slanted back of the car, with a woman holding a gun in front. [Cui Hu] glanced at the time on his watch, showing one minute left. He turned to look at [Dou Dou], who stood up unconsciously. [Cui Hu] then turned around and walked towards him.
0:35:55|0:35:57|Bending down and holding his head, [Xia Tian] asked,
0:36:14|0:36:26|[Cui Hu] kissed [Dou Dou] and patted his head. At this moment, [Xia Tian] drove over. Seeing him approaching, his men raised their guns and approached. [Xia Tian] got out of the car and rushed down, but was stopped by his men.
0:36:28|0:36:31|The woman's henchman restrains [Dou Dou], while [Xia Tian] shouts loudly.
0:36:48|0:37:14|A technician took the data module from [Xia Tian] and placed it into the detector, then brought it to show [Cui Hu], while [Xia Tian] comforted [Dou Dou] loudly. [Cui Hu] took out the data module and thought for a moment, gesturing to the woman under him to let go of [Dou Dou]. [Xia Tian] held [Dou Dou] tightly.
0:37:22|0:37:25|[Dou Dou]'s neck lit up, and [Xia Tian] looked at [Cui Hu].
0:37:31|0:37:37|[Cui Hu] looked at him, turned around, and took a pen-shaped button. [Xia Tian] asked nervously.
0:37:44|0:37:57|[Cui Hu] didn't respond, but instead leaned in to show the button to [Xia Tian], then straightened the circle, with the thumb gradually approaching the button. [Xia Tian] nervously hugged [Dou Dou], and as [Cui Hu] pressed down, a loud explosion sounded from the research institute across the river.
0:38:24|0:38:46|Say it, the villager presses the button on the handle, [Xia Tian] touches the flashing spot on [Dou Dou]'s neck. [Xia Tian] rubs and pats, but can't make the timer stop. As the timer stops, [Dou Dou] tilts his head back, [Xia Tian] drags his back and hugs him tightly into her arms.
0:39:0|0:39:16|Two thugs approached, grabbing [Xia Tian]'s arms and forcefully pulling the two apart. As [Xia Tian] was being dragged away, he screamed in despair, kicking vigorously in [Dou Dou]'s direction. But his efforts were in vain, as he was ultimately ruthlessly dragged into a commercial vehicle.
0:39:17|0:39:27|While [Dou Dou] was picked up by a henchman and thrown into the truck, [Xia Tian], who was being pulled into the car, was trying to escape through the window, but his wrists were held down by two thugs on each side.
0:39:36|0:39:39|[Xia Tian] couldn't open one hand and reached towards [Cui Hu]'s head.
0:39:42|0:39:51|The two thugs quickly pulled back [Xia Tian], once again controlling him and pressing his head against the central armrest. [Cui Hu] grabbed [Xia Tian]'s hair.
0:40:11|0:40:27|[Xia Luo]'s eyes dimmed, and after [Cui Hu] gained his approval, he raised the corners of his mouth, released the hand that was holding him down. At that moment, [Xia Tian]'s eyes rolled back, suddenly burst into tears, grabbing the car's gear lever under the driver's hand. The car went out of control in an instant, causing several people to be frightened and lean forward.
0:40:27|0:40:36|The car passed through the loop on the road, swaying calmly from side to side, with the driver [Xia Tian] carefully controlling it. The car continued to move forward on the road, swaying from side to side.
0:40:37|0:40:54|Suddenly, [Xia Tian] pushed the gear lever to the highest gear, the car veered off the road and flipped over. After a few somersaults, the car landed upside down halfway up the mountain, with both [Da Xiong] and [Cui Hu] covered in blood, unconscious.
0:40:54|0:41:0|And [Xia Tian] lay in the middle position, after opening his eyes, he climbed out of the carriage from the body of Cui Hu.
0:41:5|0:41:22|His lower body still not completely out, he lay on the ground weakly. He gasped for breath, his eyes empty, closed his eyes tightly for a moment, trying to regain his senses. When he opened his eyes again, a flying craft flew overhead, and his thoughts were suddenly brought back to the past.
0:41:22|0:41:32|At that time, [Xia Tian] was camping on the mountain with [Dou Dou], where the snow had not completely melted. He was crouching on the ground controlling the drone to fly, while [Dou Dou] stood beside him watching.
0:41:33|0:41:37|The aircraft flew out of the hill, [Xia Tian] said to [Dou Dou].
0:41:42|0:41:50|[Dou Dou] pressed the confirm button, and the aircraft sprayed catalysts around, causing dark clouds to gather and then it started to rain. [Dou Dou] cheered.
0:41:52|0:41:57|[Xia Tian] covered the sun with one hand, watching the rainbow appear at the rain pavilion, [Dou Dou] exclaimed again.
0:42:10|0:42:30|Remembering that the mother and son finished the Rainbow Warriors' signature move, [Xia Tian] decided to rush back to the research institute. However, [Xia Tian] went in the opposite direction, his footsteps echoing. Suddenly, another explosion struck, smoke and dust billowing. [Xia Tian] fell to the ground, quickly covering his head. Then he got up and took a few steps.
0:42:30|0:42:49|Just as the statue in front was about to fall, [Xia Tian] quickly stepped back. Fortunately, after the statue fell, it leaned against the pillar in front. [Xia Tian] ran a distance away, but the statue still crashed into the pillar and fell completely on the ground in the office. The broken wires sparked, and [Xia Tian] held her head with both hands.
0:42:49|0:43:0|Walking quickly inside, another explosion came from the room next to them. [Xia Tian] was pushed by the huge pressure towards the glass on the side, causing cracks to appear as their head directly hit the glass, and they fell to the ground.
0:43:0|0:43:12|[Xia Tian] lay on the ground, propping himself up with one hand, lifting his head in pain, but then falling back weakly, his left hand covering his right elbow. Before long, he managed to stand up with great effort, pushed open the office door, and finally left.
0:43:35|0:43:43|[Da Xiong] looked at [Xia Tian], who was covered in wounds. However, [Xia Tian] calmly walked to the control panel and wiped away the dust with his arm.
0:44:38|0:44:51|The explosion of the fish body shattered the glass of the operator, and Xia Tian, who had completed the change of clothes, had already entered the teleportation room. She clicked on the particle reorganization on the internal screen, then clicked OK, and the reorganization was ready to start loading.
0:44:51|0:45:11|After the loading is complete, [Xia Tian] takes a step back, lifts his head, and looks inside the familiar yet unfamiliar teleporter. Outside, [Da Xiong], who was knocked down by the explosion, stands up and looks at [Xia Tian] inside the teleporter. The components inside the teleporter start to operate, [Xia Tian] feels the vibration, looks down at his feet, and hears [Da Xiong]'s voice.
0:45:11|0:45:17|[Xia Tian] looked at [Da Xiong] outside, although he was panting, his eyes were still determined. The iron cover and petal cover under his feet opened.
0:45:18|0:45:35|[Xia Tian] took a small step back and looked down through the glass cover. From here, you could see that the teleporter was very high, with each level of the central research institute designed as instruments, gradually shrinking towards the top and bottom. [Xia Tian] looked at the teleporter beneath her feet, like an abyss with no bottom.
0:45:36|0:45:53|With his face covered in scars, he took another small step and returned to the center. He lifted his eyes and clenched his fists. As the glass cover opened, [Xia Tian] fell down completely. Under the influence of gravity, he somersaulted, head down, passing through the layers inside the transporter.
0:45:53|0:45:58|At the same time as he fell, the top of the teleporter at the research institute was spinning rapidly.
0:45:59|0:46:16|As the fall height increased, [Xia Tian] raised his arms to cushion some of the impact. Upon reaching the bottom, it appeared like a water surface in the center, shining brightly. Passing through this, [Xia Tian] seemed to enter another world, surrounded only by smoke and reflected light.
0:46:16|0:46:35|As Xia Tian lost gravity, she slowly rotated in mid-air. Gradually, the special material of her clothes began to disintegrate into particles, followed by Xia Tian's skin also breaking down into particles, until she completely turned into particles, slowly dissipating in this space.
0:46:35|0:46:45|During this process, everything started to rewind, and the files that exploded in the explosion all returned to their original state. [Xia Tian], who rushed back to the research institute, went from moving forward to moving backward.
0:46:46|0:46:59|The fallen statue struggled to stand up, the car rolling down the hill returned to the road, [Dou Dou] thrown into the truck also returned to the hands of the person at the car door, while An Bao was waiting for [Xia Tian] at the elevator entrance.
0:47:1|0:47:20|Time goes back to one hour and fifty minutes ago, [Da Xiong] is in the office of the teleportation room, looking at the data. He picks up a folder from the shelf next to him and spreads it out, then takes another pair of observation glasses from the shelf and puts them on. At this moment, a prompt box pops up on the screen in front of him. He takes off the observation glasses again, and the screen shows the machine is operating.
0:47:20|0:47:28|There was a commotion behind him. He turned back in confusion and looked at the teleporter. [Da Xiong] turned his seat around, put down his observation glasses, stood up, and said, "Someone?"
0:48:19|0:48:31|[Da Xiong] ran to help [Xia Tian] get her clothes, but inside the teleportation room, [Xia Tian] covered her head. She furrowed her brows, stood up with the help of the door frame of the teleporter, took a few steps out, covered her head again, almost losing her balance and falling backwards.
0:48:31|0:48:38|Fortunately, leaning against the door frame to support himself, before long, [Xia Tian] came out dressed and [Da Xiong] was full of questions.
0:48:49|0:49:7|[Da Xiong] opened his mouth in surprise, while [Xia Tian] didn't bother to explain further and dialed the phone. After a few rings, the voice of Xiang Dong came through.
0:49:15|0:49:19|Da Xiong and Huang Chen happened to take the elevator up.
0:49:35|0:49:53|In the analysis room, a bottle of medicine fell from the shelf. Xia Tian heard a sound from the east, turned around, bent down to pick up the bottle, and as he was about to put it back on the shelf, a hand suddenly reached out from the opposite side, tightly grabbing Xia Tian's collar. Before Xia Tian could react, a syringe was inserted into his neck.
0:49:54|0:50:8|Xiangdong was injected with PTX solution, his head quickly flushed with blood, gradually losing strength and falling down. Xia Tian, who rushed to the analysis room, first glanced upstairs, only to see the man in a suit with blood on his hands standing up.
0:50:8|0:50:24|[Xia Tian] walked around to a more easily observable experimental platform, while the man in a suit walked down the stairs, adjusting his sleeves. Seeing the man about to reach the first floor, [Xia Tian] quickly hid behind a pillar. After the man in the suit left, [Xia Tian] turned around, pondered for a moment, and secretly used a piece of cotton cloth in the nearby laboratory to get wet.
0:50:26|0:50:39|In the first timeline, [Xia Tian] is about to arrive at the analysis room. Sure enough, the man in a suit who walks out of the analysis room runs into the returning [Xia Tian] from the first timeline. He rushes to the second floor of the analysis room, is startled by the body facing east, and sits on the ground.
0:50:39|0:50:44|In the second timeline, [Xia Tian] rushed up and covered his mouth with a piece of cloth when he turned around.
0:50:45|0:50:52|In the first timeline, [Xia Tian] struggled for a moment before losing consciousness, while in the second timeline, [Xia Tian] clenched his fists again.
0:50:52|0:51:4|In the second time and space, [Xia Tian] looked around, first placed the first time and space's [Xia Tian] on the ground, then picked up the eyeball pointing east and put it in the pocket. At this moment, the phone in the pocket of the first time and space's [Xia Tian] started vibrating.
0:51:4|0:51:16|In the second time and space, [Xia Tian] took out his phone from his pocket, showing an unknown number, presumably from [Cui Hu]. [Xia Tian] hung up the phone, then took out the gift that [Da Xiong] gave to [Dou Dou] from his pocket.
0:51:16|0:51:29|He took out the rainbow warrior's watch from the bag, looked at it and put it on his wrist. Then he turned his head and noticed the enclosed cart next to the filing cabinet. Inside the teleportation room, [Da Xiong] is checking data for [Huang Chen].
0:51:38|0:51:43|[Huang Chen] checks the data in the folder, while [Da Xiong] answers the phone.
0:51:49|0:51:56|[Da Xiong] looked towards the open elevator door and quickly used both hands to hold back [Huang Chen] who was about to turn around.
0:52:4|0:52:6|[Da Xiong] picks up the headphones and says.
0:52:17|0:52:32|He turned [Huang Chen]'s chair towards the screen and quickly went to deal with Xia Tian in the first time-space, while Xia Tian in the second time-space was rushing to the office of the Director, avoiding the collision with the cart that should have happened, but the person next to it couldn't catch up.
0:52:32|0:52:41|[Xia Tian] yawned and walked away, entering the teleportation room. After a quick glance, [Da Xiong] pulled the cart in. Unexpectedly, [Huang Chen] suddenly turned around and shouted.
0:52:45|0:52:52|Terrified, [Da Xiong] quickly sat on the nearby chair, with one arm resting on the cart, he waved at [Huang Chen] to signal him to turn his head.
0:52:53|0:53:1|Next, [Da Xiong] called out [Xia Tian] from the first time-space and put her into the wardrobe. On the other side, at the entrance of the director's office.
0:53:24|0:53:37|[Director] watched as he walked away, knowing full well that [Xia Tian] had smoothly entered the database, waiting once again for the data to be synthesized. In a moment, he remembered [Dou Dou]'s cry for help, his fingers inserted into the nearby hair.
0:53:43|0:53:48|After some thought, he tied up his hair and entered the room, [Da Xiong] took off [Huang Chen]'s headphones.
0:54:1|0:54:15|In the database, the data has been synthesized, [Xia Tian] picks up the data module and leaves. Inside the analysis room, [Huang Chen] notices that the second floor is empty, so she tries to put down the data first. However, after entering the file cabinet password, it shows an error and she can't open the cabinet door.
0:54:15|0:54:19|He was surprised for a moment, put down the folder, entered the password again, and used both hands to pull open the cabinet door.
0:55:4|0:55:15|The scene cuts back to the analysis room. The repairman fixes it and opens the cabinet door, Huang Chen peeks inside.
0:55:27|0:55:36|[Director] stood up. At this time, Xiang Jian had already driven to the parking lot on the opposite bank.
0:55:47|0:55:55|Cui Hu's henchman Wen Sheng hurried over, while Xia Tian quickly entered a kill code and held up the hand with the data above the water.
0:55:56|0:56:1|[Cui Hu] quickly walked over, [Xia Tian] tightly grasped the data card, staring at [Cui Hu] and said.
0:56:5|0:56:12|His fingers gradually loosened, then clenched tightly again. [Cui Hu] paused for a moment, then turned to the henchmen behind him and spoke.
0:56:13|0:56:23|The gun of the female henchman aiming at [Dou Dou]'s neck sucked out the bomb.
0:56:25|0:56:42|[Dou Dou], who was running past, was grabbed by [Cui Hu] by the hat and pulled aside. [Xia Tian] understood his intention, took a step forward and squatted down, slowly placing the data module on the ground. Seeing this, a look of disdain appeared on [Cui Hu]'s face, then he let go of [Dou Dou].
0:56:43|0:56:49|At that moment, [Cui Hu] and [Xia Tian] both drew their pistols. [Xia Tian]'s gun was aimed at the data module.
0:56:52|0:56:55|The two sides confronted each other, with [Dou Dou] running over to hug [Xia Tian].
0:56:59|0:57:11|[Dou Dou] ran towards the side of the car after hearing the words. [Cui Hu] looked at [Xia Tian] in front of him, tilted his head and smiled. [Xia Tian] sighed, took a step back, and the other person took a step closer. [Xia Tian] shouted.
0:57:14|0:57:26|Sun Hu put away his gun and said to his men, Xia Tian turned his head to look inside the car, Dou Dou was already seated, so he slowly backed away. The technician walked up carrying a box, but Xia Tian pulled out a gun.
0:57:28|0:57:34|[Cui Hu] opened his arms to signal everyone, then raised his gun.
0:57:40|0:57:58|[Cui Hu] shouted loudly and his subordinates ran back to start the car, while the technician sat on the ground checking the data module. [Cui Hu] walked towards him, and the technician raised his hand and said. After listening, [Cui Hu] furrowed his brow and looked up. Inside the research institute's database, the researcher checked and said to [Director].
0:57:58|0:58:10|The security team leader walked forward, [Director] turned around with arms crossed, everyone was very puzzled, across the river [Xia Tian] was driving and comforting [Dou Dou].
0:58:16|0:58:22|The fierce impact scared [Dou Dou] from sitting behind [Xia Tian] to sitting directly behind. [Cui Hu] directed his subordinates.
0:58:29|0:58:47|Suddenly, [Xia Tian] made a sharp turn with the steering wheel, with [Cui Hu] and others in hot pursuit. Several cars drove into the border defense area of the container yard. [Xia Tian] tried to turn around among the piles of containers, but ran into a forklift carrying boxes. Due to the excessive driving speed, there was no time to dodge.
0:58:47|0:58:52|Still frowning at the door and brakes, but still crashed into it, [Dou Dou] hugged the seat and vomited.
0:58:52|0:59:6|Soon, [Cui Hu] and the others' two cars caught up with [Xia Tian], one following behind and one pulling up alongside. The car on the side suddenly swerved towards [Xia Tian], nearly hitting the central divider on the other side. Inside the car, [Xia Tian] and [Dou Dou] were moving violently.
0:59:6|0:59:23|The vehicles on the side continued to squeeze over, and [Xia Tian]'s car rubbed against the assembled box and turned forward. It looked like it was about to hit the assembled box in front. [Xia Tian] quickly squeezed out and turned the steering wheel, only to find a pile of wooden boxes filled with goods next to it. As the wooden boxes were knocked open, [Xia Tian]'s face also hit the steering wheel.
0:59:23|0:59:32|The gunman behind Cui Hu got off the car, [Xia Tian] held his head and touched the corner of his mouth, glanced back. [Xia Tian] shifted gears and reversed the car.
0:59:38|0:59:50|[Xia Tian] slams into the container at an angle, then swerves sharply with [Dou Dou]. But [Xia Tian] quickly starts the car again and drives forward, with the henchmen in woolen hats quickly dodging and jumping into the car with the door open, while the others quickly get in the car to continue the chase.
0:59:52|0:59:58|[Xia Tian] glanced at the situation controlling the mirror, but didn't notice that a container was being lowered in front by a container handler.
0:59:58|1:0:11|When [Xia Tian] noticed, he could only close his eyes tightly and step on the gas pedal, driving down the ramp covered with wooden planks. The container was placed at the same height, just sandwiching the rear of [Xia Tian]'s car, slowly lifting the entire car.
1:0:11|1:0:18|At this moment, the henchmen in the car behind also drove forward, but failed to brake in time, crashing diagonally into the container. Another car followed closely behind.
1:0:19|1:0:36|The handle on the side of the container that was violently hit shook, one end slammed straight towards the ground, and the other end was about to come off. [Dou Dou] tightly grabbed the handrail at the back of the driver's seat, [Xia Tian] stepped on the gas pedal directly towards the wooden box, only to see [Dou Dou] looking through the rear window, watching the container about to come down.
1:0:36|1:0:45|At a critical moment, the wooden box was pushed open, and the container fell behind the car. However, obviously, this rescue attempt was not successful, and [Xia Tian] once again returned to the teleporter.
1:0:46|1:1:3|In the teleporter, [Xia Tian] inside looked pale, with furrowed brows and opened eyes filled not only with pain but also deep hatred. He tried to prop himself up with his arms, but due to the pain, he lowered his head again. After making another effort to sit up, the struggling [Xia Tian] knelt on the ground, his head drooping in agony.
1:1:3|1:1:9|[Da Xiong] ran over at the sound, only to see [Xia Tian] standing up with the door of the transporter supported by his hands, but his eyes turned fierce.
1:1:10|1:1:17|In his mind, the face of [Cui Hu] from the second spacetime appeared, with one hand gripping the steering wheel and the other hand holding a gun.
1:1:17|1:1:29|Thinking of this, [Xia Tian] glanced sideways, propping up his chin, while [Cui Hu] pulled the trigger, the bullet shot out, shattering the front windshield of the second time-space [Xia Tian], heading straight towards the back seat where [Dou Dou] was sitting.
1:1:29|1:1:38|Dou Dou's right chest was hit by a bullet, blood splattered out from the back, and the impact caused the person to fall backwards. Xia Tian opened his mouth and turned towards the back.
1:1:39|1:1:53|In this moment of recollection, Xia Tian from the Third Space is already filled with hatred. In the memory, Cui Hu tilts his head, looking ahead with no expression. Xia Tian from the Second Space unbuckles the seatbelt and calls out to Dou Dou, who has already fallen in the back seat.
1:1:53|1:2:3|In the third dimension, [Da Xiong] asked anxiously, grabbing his arm.
1:2:9|1:2:12|[Xia Tian] actually pressed [Da Xiong] against the wall by his neck.
1:2:17|1:2:20|[Xia Tian] still firmly grasped [Da Xiong] and said.
1:2:28|1:2:36|After speaking, [Xia Tian] turned and walked away, with [Da Xiong] calling out to him, "Xia Tian, don't take any more risks, don't kill me!"
1:2:40|1:2:51|[Xia Tian] knocked over the cart, turned and walked into the elevator, while [Da Xiong] lowered his head and then looked at [Xia Tian]. The scene shifts to the data center, where the security team leader says to [Director],
1:3:0|1:3:18|The elevator doors open, a security guard walks in, but the [Director] notices [Xia Tian] on the elevator monitor. The security guard reports, and the security team leader says to the [Director] who has caught sight of [Xia Tian].
1:3:21|1:3:28|At this moment, [Xia Tian] from the third time-space is driving and talking on the phone. [Xia Tian] from the second time-space picks up the phone.
1:3:40|1:3:56|In the third spacetime, [Xia Tian] did not answer, hung up the phone, his face only calm, while on the overpass, [Cui Hu] was driving, aiming the wrist handle at the screen, and the location appeared on the screen. He looked up into the distance, then followed the direction of the location, swerving into the underground passage at the loop.
1:3:56|1:4:6|Xia Tian from the second time-space was stopped on the narrow path under the Guangxia Cloud Terrace. Xia Tian from the second time-space, watching the positioning of the running vehicle, realized that the other party had no intention of stopping the vehicle after speeding past the parked vehicle.
1:4:9|1:4:24|[Dou Dou] stood up in confusion, but at that moment, [Cui Hu] pulled out a handgun. The events that had occurred in the second timeline, where Dou Dou was shot in the head, flashed through his mind in the third timeline. With these thoughts, he unexpectedly turned the steering wheel on the loop and crashed into his own abdomen.
1:4:49|1:5:4|In her arms, [Dou Dou] was still looking at the oncoming car, while the Xia Tian from the second timeline was running and looking back. The Xia Tian from the third timeline had her head buried in the airbag, trying hard to stay awake. Cui Hu, who got off the car at the last moment, was the first to climb up from the ground.
1:5:4|1:5:14|He supported the car and looked inside. [Xia Tian] from the third time-space, then turned to look at the second time-space [Xia Tian] who was leaving with [Dou Dou]. In the end, he decided to chase after the two who were escaping.
1:5:15|1:5:27|Xiangyan ran back and forth under the overpass, with [Xia Tian] pulling [Dou Dou] around a pillar and stopping at the roadside. When [Cui Hu] caught up, all he could see was the barren land of Xiaoli Tang, and [Xia Tian] and Mu Jing were nowhere to be seen.
1:5:27|1:5:34|Cui Hu then glanced at his watch, smiled slightly, and ran forward. Xia Tian in the third time-space who stayed behind finally woke up.
1:5:35|1:5:46|He pushed open the car door and got out of the car, the three of them had disappeared without a trace, but he noticed the gun left by [Cui Hu] on the passenger seat. At this moment, in the second timeline, [Xia Tian] with [Dou Dou], ran into an abandoned school.
1:5:50|1:6:5|[Dou Dou] slipped on the ground, and in the second time-space, [Xia Tian] helped her up and ran up the stairs with her. The abandoned school was filled with iron scaffolding, and the two ran inside, finding a hidden room. [Xia Tian] lifted [Dou Dou] and placed her on the table, then bent down with both hands on the table.
1:6:5|1:6:10|After speaking, she once again hugged [Dou Dou].
1:6:46|1:6:54|Footsteps could be heard in the staircase, and she looked to the side. She looked down through the broken window and saw [Cui Hu] walking up the stairs.
1:6:56|1:7:3|While she was puzzled, [Dou Dou] played with the rainbow watch in her hand. Just as she was about to happily put it on, she noticed something was not quite right.
1:7:10|1:7:15|[Xia Tian] from the Second Space-Time walks over to take the watch and looks at [Dou Dou] inquiringly.
1:7:17|1:7:30|He looked at his watch again, then squatted down and smashed the back cover of the watch. After picking it up, he unexpectedly found a shining part inside the watch. After examining it for a while, he understood.
1:7:32|1:7:42|He looked up and turned his eyes, unable to believe it, and weakly lowered his hand. Inside the research institute, the [Director] looked at [Xia Tian] in the first time and space.
1:8:20|1:8:25|The research institute is about to explode, we must hurry and back up all the data.
1:8:36|1:8:49|[Da Xiong] let go of [Xia Tian]'s hand and watched as the two of them left. Inside the abandoned school, [Cui Hu] approached.
1:8:49|1:9:11|Cui Hu, who had just finished the intercom conversation, glanced at his watch, then lifted his head with a slight smile on his lips. Upstairs, the dismantled watch was placed on the table. Cui Hu pushed open the door and walked in. Finding no one there, he looked at his wrist, then walked to the table. In the second time-space, Xia Tian and Dou Dou were hiding nearby, watching him.
1:9:16|1:9:36|[Cui Hu] was looking at the watch on the table. Suddenly, there was a noise behind him. His right foot was caught by a rope, causing him to twist towards the ground. In the next room, [Da Xiong] and [Dou Dou] were pushing a piano. Despite [Cui Hu]'s struggles, the piano was already pushed aside, and [Cui Hu] ended up hanging on the edge of the cabinet.
1:9:39|1:9:56|[Xia Tian] and [Dou Dou] pushed the piano hard, and as the window glass shattered, the piano fell out. Eventually, the whole person was lifted up and leaned against the wall. The [Xia Tian] from the third time period who rushed over happened to see the piano being pushed out of the window. Holding a gun, he quickly ran towards the building, his face filled with worry.
1:9:57|1:10:14|In the abandoned school project, [Cui Hu] is still struggling. In the second time-space, [Xia Tian] runs out of the room holding [Dou Dou], while [Cui Hu] hangs upside down with arms crossed. After a pause, he pulls out the forgotten dagger, hangs upside down with a bent waist, hands gripping his legs and pushing upwards, tries to make a cut with the dagger, but fails.
1:10:14|1:10:25|At this moment, in the second timeline, [Xia Tian] ran up the stairs with [Dou Dou], while [Cui Hu] paused again, pressing the tip of the dagger against the wall, bending over and arching upwards. This time, he failed to complete the task.
1:10:28|1:10:45|With the piano falling outside the window, [Cui Hu] fell onto the storage cabinet and then onto the ground, gasping for breath. In the hallway, in the second time-space, [Xia Tian] pulled [Dou Dou] downstairs, [Cui Hu] recovered and chased after them, kicking and shattering the fire glass in the stairs, taking out an axe.
1:11:3|1:11:27|Smashing the locker while walking, then peeking inside, he smiled, raised his index finger, took two steps, and smashed the locker again with an axe. In the second time and space, [Xia Tian] tightly hugged [Dou Dou] in the locker without making a sound, while [Cui Hu] paused and listened carefully, seeming to have a direction.
1:11:27|1:11:29|[Xia Tian] is preparing to peek through the crack to see what's going on.
1:11:32|1:11:53|Perhaps thinking that Village Tiger's axe came crashing in directly, he struck twice more fiercely. This time the crack that appeared wasn't big enough, so he reached in and grabbed [Dou Dou] by the collar. [Dou Dou] struggled in fear. [Xia Tian] pushed the cabinet door hard, causing it to block towards the opposite side, trapping Village Tiger's hand.
1:12:17|1:12:33|Dou Dou ran away crying, Cui Hu grabbed Xia Tian's collar and strangled him, but released his hand before he suffocated, throwing him to the ground. Xia Tian, lying on the ground, crawled forward. Seeing Xia Tian in this state, Cui Hu, weakened, bent down to pull him up, but did not expect to...
1:12:34|1:12:49|[Xia Tian] grabbed the wood chips on the ground and threw them towards himself. [Cui Hu] quickly blocked with his arm, but five eyes were still left on the ground. Taking this opportunity, [Xia Tian] ran away, jumping from one level of the construction scaffolding to another, with [Cui Hu] swiftly chasing after him.
1:12:49|1:12:59|[Xia Tian] ran while looking back, but noticed that [Cui Hu] was nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, [Cui Hu] watched [Xia Tian] slowly approaching through the wide cloth, while [Xia Tian] was still clinging to the pole, looking up.
1:12:59|1:13:7|Suddenly, Cui Hu grabbed Xia Tian's foot from below, holding onto the pole and shaking the armor hard, reaching out his arm to grab him.
1:13:9|1:13:26|One brother hung on the iron bar and turned outward, while the other hand tightly grabbed the iron bar. His body bumped over, and his feet slowly touched the iron bar below. [Cui Hu] grabbed his ankle again, he kicked hard, [Cui Hu] let go of his hand, but the other hand firmly held onto the iron bar, and the two climbed up, one high and one low.
1:13:26|1:13:32|[Xia Tian] climbed up one level and crawled in, running to the side, but was grabbed by the neck by [Cui Hu] who climbed up.
1:13:33|1:13:41|Watching [Xia Tian] being choked and coughing, he released his hand and pushed [Xia Tian] to the ground. [Xia Tian], who fell to the ground, tried to crawl forward but was stopped by [Cui Hu] stepping on his leg.
1:13:41|1:13:51|[Xia Tian] sat up, but pushed [Cui Hu]'s legs. [Cui Hu] grabbed his back collar and punched him one after another, four punches later, [Xia Tian] fell to the ground.
1:13:53|1:14:6|Dou Dou, who ran into the classroom crying, saw a flashing data cable on the table and picked it up to take a look. Meanwhile, Cui Hu had already dragged Xia Tian away from the construction scaffolding and threw him into the corridor. After taking a deep breath, he said.
1:14:12|1:14:20|At this moment, the third construction worker Xia Tian arrived, fired a few shots, hitting the glass above Cui Hu's head. He picked up the glass from the ground and held it against the second construction worker Xia Tian.
1:14:31|1:14:37|In the third dimension, [Xia Tian] approached with a gun, while [Cui Hu] pressed a glass against the neck of the second dimension's [Xia Tian].
1:15:2|1:15:7|After speaking, [Xia Tian] pushed open the door to the second time-space, jumped to the side, and slid down along the banner.
1:15:8|1:15:16|After firing several shots, Xia Tian from the Third Space-Time quickly dodged the bullets from Qianhu's men and crouched down next to Xia Tian from the Second Space-Time.
1:15:27|1:15:31|Xia Tian from the second time-space and Da Xiong from the third time-space got off the car.
1:15:43|1:15:55|After speaking, he turned around and started shooting at Cui Hu's henchmen. In the second timeline, Xia Tian got up and ran towards the classroom. Bullets hit the handrail in the corridor. In the third timeline, Xia Tian dodged and fired back, then retreated to the other side and flipped over.
1:16:4|1:16:14|In the second time and space, [Xia Tian] took the data cable from [Dou Dou]. She rubbed [Dou Dou]'s hair and [Dou Dou] pointed to his neck.
1:16:26|1:16:37|[Xia Tian] turned his head and looked around, his gaze falling on the escape pod by the window. Then, he tied himself and [Dou Dou] with a rope, with his feet against the wall, slowly moving towards the ground.
1:16:37|1:16:47|Before long, the two landed safely on the ground. Meanwhile, indoors, [Xia Tian] from the Third Space-Time was going downstairs and shooting at the henchmen blowing fire across from her, but she got shot in the arm by them.
1:16:47|1:17:3|The four henchmen across the way intensified their attack with fire. Injured, he ran back, wanting to fight back, only to find that his gun was out of bullets. Seeing him motionless, the four henchmen ran over to search through a pile of debris. One bald henchman spotted a storage cabinet nearby.
1:17:9|1:17:26|Unexpectedly, the cabinet door opened, and [Xia Tian] from the Third Space quickly attached a bomb to him, then closed the cabinet door. The storage cabinet was blown open and rushed towards the first floor. [Xia Tian] from the Third Space pushed open a corner of the burning cabinet, lay down for a moment, and then crawled out.
1:17:26|1:17:32|At this moment, [Xia Tian] in the second timeline has already taken [Dou Dou] to the hospital, pushing a hospital bed while making a phone call.
1:17:36|1:17:40|[Dou Dou] was pushed into the ward, and [Xia Tian] took a deep breath.
1:17:44|1:17:51|[Da Xiong] put down his phone blankly, as if suddenly remembering something, and looked towards the door. Then he ran into the room, catching the attention of [Xia Tian] from the first time and space.
1:18:6|1:18:9|You actually... [Xia Tian] hurried over to [Da Xiong].
1:18:20|1:18:24|Xia Tian, crouching on the ground, looked up at Director.
1:18:28|1:18:31|[Da Xiong] had no reaction, [Xia Tian] looked at [Suo Zhang].
1:20:1|1:20:19|[Director] was lost in memories, with a family photo and a written notice of stepping down as the head of the laboratory on November 1, 2025, placed on the table. He picked up the medicine bottle on the table, about to pour it all out, when a hand holding a gun knocked the bottle away. [Director] asked. The person was none other than [Cui Hu].
1:20:27|1:20:31|[Cui Hu] played with the medicine bottle, looked up at [Captain], and then [Captain] continued speaking.
1:20:37|1:20:41|Hearing this, [Cui Hu] sat up straight, while the [chief] tilted his head and pointed fiercely.
1:20:55|1:21:11|The memories ended, and people from the research institute scattered. [Cui Hu] came in and immediately used a dagger to take down a security guard. He gasped for breath and slowly lifted his head, looking at the central sculpture. The statue depicted a deity with huge wings, arms crossed over the chest, seemingly staring at [Cui Hu].
1:21:11|1:21:23|The data module in the database is completed and automatically cleared. [Director] turned around and walked to the center of the console. He turned his head and looked at [Xia Tian].
1:21:31|1:21:47|The [Chief] immediately pulled out a gun and aimed at the first moment of the scare. At this moment, [Cui Hu] walked in and directly threw a dagger, hitting the wrist of [Chief] holding the gun. [Xia Tian] turned around and looked at this fierce man. [Cui Hu] also glanced at [Xia Tian] and walked up to the [Chief].
1:21:47|1:21:51|The director wanted to pick up the injured gun, but was caught by [Cui Hu] who snatched it away.
1:22:1|1:22:9|[Cui Hu] pulled the trigger as he spoke, then slowly lowered his hand and looked down at the director lying in a pool of blood, while on the other side, inside the hospital.
1:22:9|1:22:20|In the second time and space, [Xia Tian] touches [Dou Dou]'s face in front of the sickbed, looks up, and sees the data cable in the plate on the table. The scene returns to the database, [Cui Hu] walks towards [Xia Tian] in the first time and space.
1:22:48|1:23:6|[Xia Tian] cried as he tried to come up with an excuse before dinner, but he was held at gunpoint by [Cui Hu]. Helpless, [Xia Tian] could only cry in pain as [Cui Hu] bent his arm and reached out to grab his clothes. The gun was pointed at [Xia Tian]'s chin in the first time and space.
1:23:6|1:23:17|But upon hearing this, he also began to ponder. Suddenly, a figure of Xia Tian from a different time and space rushed out of the ventilation duct, and shot a gun at Cui Hu through the glass, hitting Cui Hu's upper arm.
1:23:18|1:23:35|[Cui Hu] held the injured area and fired several shots. [Xia Tian] from the first timeline was scared and screamed, while the [Xia Tian] from the third timeline used a pillar as cover and waited for a moment before firing back. [Cui Hu] hid inside the control panel, preparing to grab the receipt module first, but was shot by the [Xia Tian] from the third timeline.
1:23:35|1:23:37|[Cui Hu]'s eyes suddenly turned fierce.
1:23:38|1:23:52|In the first timeline, [Xia Tian] sat on the steps watching the two people. [Cui Hu] angrily walked towards the third timeline's [Xia Tian]. The third timeline's [Xia Tian] suddenly emerged from behind a pillar. Before he could fire, [Cui Hu] hit his hand, causing the gun to fall out.
1:23:52|1:24:2|When [Cui Hu] was passing by the steps, [Xia Tian] from the first timeline rushed over, hugged [Cui Hu]'s leg and lifted up. [Xia Tian] from the third timeline took the opportunity to rush forward and firmly held onto [Cui Hu]'s injured arm.
1:24:3|1:24:21|Blood gushed out, [Cui Hu] grabbed [Xia Tian] from the third time-space and pushed him down. However, he picked up the dagger on the ground, just as [Xia Tian] from the first time-space strangled [Cui Hu] from behind. The [Xia Tian] from the third time-space stepped forward and stabbed [Cui Hu] in the chest, while his other hand tightly gripped his neck. [Cui Hu]'s face began to swell due to congestion.
1:24:22|1:24:35|In the third time-space, [Xia Tian] just stared coldly at [Cui Hu]. In the first time-space, [Xia Tian] was scared by this situation and let go of the hand, stepping back repeatedly. However, in the third time-space, [Xia Tian] was still exerting force with her hand. Gradually, the gun in [Cui Hu]'s hand slipped to the ground.
1:24:35|1:24:45|And in the third spacetime, [Xia Tian] also let go of his hand. [Cui Hu] covered his wound and sat leaning against the data table. Inside the hospital, in the second spacetime, [Xia Tian] found a computer that could analyze data.
1:25:5|1:25:19|[Cui Hu] is lost in memories, with a data cable inserted into his forehead. At that moment, in the second time-space within the hospital, [Xia Tian] plugs the data cable into the computer, and a foreigner appears on the screen, saying, "The experimental recording device has been implanted in your body."
1:25:46|1:25:50|In the second time and space, Xia Tian listened as the person on the screen spoke to Cui Hu.
1:26:5|1:26:8|Before leaving the computer, the nurse asked [Xia Tian] from the Second Time Space.
1:26:16|1:26:30|[Xia Tian] took the pen, but noticed the spots on her hand. After the nurse left, she rolled up her sleeve and indeed, there were many spots on her arm. She thought of what Dong said.
1:27:6|1:27:11|In the third dimension, [Xia Tian] looks at the first dimension's [Xia Tian] with a tilted head.
1:27:43|1:27:59|The explosion rang out, Xia Tian from the first timeline took the opportunity to push Xia Tian from the third timeline. Xia Tian from the third timeline quickly shot at him as he ran out, causing Xia Tian from the first timeline to fall to the ground with a shot in the leg. At this moment, the gun was out of bullets, so he quickly got up and ran through the harbor gate.
1:28:55|1:29:5|At this moment, [Xia Tian] from the second timeline walked in with a gun. [Xia Tian] from the third timeline lowered his arm, turned to look at him, and took a step forward.
1:30:6|1:30:27|Both fired their guns simultaneously, [Xia Tian] in the second timeline was shot in the left shoulder, while [Xia Tian] in the third timeline was shot in the heart. Frowning, they stared ahead and then tried to look back, but their body involuntarily knelt down on the ground. They then slumped to the ground, with [Xia Tian] in the second timeline enduring the pain in their shoulder, not daring to relax.
1:30:28|1:30:41|At this moment, [Xia Tian] from the Third Space-Time raised his head, took two steps forward, blood trickled from his mouth, then uncontrollably spat out two mouthfuls of blood, his body swaying slightly before finally collapsing completely to the ground.
1:30:45|1:30:59|In the second time and space, [Xia Tian] watched as tears streamed down his face, covering his wound and unable to bear looking at him any longer, shaking his head with a lowered gaze. In the first time and space, [Xia Tian] stood behind, breathing heavily in a daze, frozen in place.
1:30:59|1:31:4|In the Third Space, [Xia Tian] is lying on the ground with a pistol hanging by his side, a large amount of blood seeping from his chest.
1:31:7|1:31:27|Explosions began to occur throughout the research institute, with concrete falling from high above, posing a constant threat. In the first timeline, [Xia Tian] limped over to the second timeline's [Xia Tian], wanting to examine its wound, but the second timeline's [Xia Tian] sidestepped, covering its still bleeding shoulder and bowing its head.
1:31:47|1:32:1|In the second timeline, [Xia Tian] is pushing the arm of the Xia Tian from the first timeline. The Xia Tian from the first timeline is in tears, looks at the teleporter, then at him, and walks towards the elevator. She, who opens the elevator door, turns around. The Xia Tian from the second timeline is already standing in the teleporter.
1:32:12|1:32:31|In the first timeline, [Xia Tian] enters the elevator and presses the floor button. In her line of sight, the [Xia Tian] from the second timeline looks up from the transporter. In the midst of the fire, the entire building begins to collapse. The [Xia Tian] from the first timeline rushes out of the elevator, grabs the nearby cart, and then moves towards the lamppost.
1:32:46|1:32:59|[Da Xiong] leaned on the ground with a punch, blood still flowing from his injured abdomen. [Xia Tian] from the first time and space quickly supported his arm. Inside the hospital, [Dou Dou] woke up on the sickbed and sat up to look around.
1:32:59|1:33:12|In the teleportation room, [Xia Tian] from the second time-space came to his senses. The blood on his face had already partially dried. After taking a deep breath, he turned around. Tears welled up in his eyes as he blinked and then clicked on the recombination sample on the screen.
1:33:13|1:33:30|The confirm button on the screen is no longer clickable, only zero percent is still lit. He knows that when it reaches zero percent, the screen will turn completely white and start flashing. His hand pauses in mid-air, then after making a firm decision, he purses his lips and slowly moves his blood-stained hand closer to the screen.
1:33:30|1:33:35|At this moment, the phone in his pocket suddenly vibrated, causing him to pause in surprise.
1:33:36|1:33:53|He lowered his head and slowly put his hand into his pocket. The phone screen showed an incoming call from [Dou Dou]. The hand holding the phone involuntarily tightened. He raised his hand, glanced at the screen, and finally slid to answer the call. At this moment, [Dou Dou] was outside the hospital room, with an IV stand in her hand.
1:35:38|1:35:50|At this moment, [Xia Tian] in the second timeline had tears all over her face. After smiling and speaking to [Dou Dou], she immediately turned into a sad expression. She then hung up the phone, while [Dou Dou] kept staring at the mobile phone.
1:35:50|1:35:59|On the overpass, [Huang Chen] sitting in the ambulance, sees [Xia Tian] from the first time and space, helping [Da Xiong] walk over. [Huang Chen] jumps out of the car.
1:36:2|1:36:6|One on the left and one on the right, with the help of medical staff, they placed [Da Xiong] in the car.
1:36:54|1:37:11|On the twentieth day, [Xia Tian] went down under the transporter, arms wide open, falling once again into that place that seemed like another world. This time, he lay there calmly, with his hair swaying on his face, tears welling up in his eyes as images of [Dou Dou] appeared.
1:37:11|1:37:15|Reading to [Dou Dou] in bed, the two of them share a joyful and laughter-filled moment.
1:37:16|1:37:30|[Dou Dou] and his own smiling face were very clear. Thinking of this, he closed his eyes, and as tears fell, they quickly dissipated. Remembering when he and [Dou Dou] were on the mountaintop, waving at the aircraft, and chasing after it.
1:37:30|1:37:35|[Dou Dou] pulled him towards the aircraft, holding a phone in one hand and embracing [Dou Dou] with the other.
1:37:37|1:37:55|As more and more tears floated in the air, her face gradually dissipated from the edges, followed by her clothes, her limbs, but below was a fiery light. In the second dimension, [Xia Tian] gradually merged with that beam of light, disappearing without a trace.
1:37:55|1:38:3|In the hospital, [Dou Dou] is sitting in the lobby waiting. Xia Tian from the first time-space runs into the hallway, leaning against the wall and holding his injured leg. When he sees [Dou Dou], he shouts, "Dou Dou!"
1:38:14|1:38:25|[Dou Dou] immediately stood up and pushed the IV stand over, [Xia Tian] also squatted down and spread his legs. He saw that [Dou Dou]'s neck had been bandaged, once again hugged [Dou Dou] and touched his head.
1:38:29|1:38:42|This time, [Xia Tian] held [Dou Dou]'s face, looked at him with a smile, and then tightly hugged [Dou Dou], tears streaming down. [Dou Dou] hugged [Xia Tian] back, resting his head on his shoulder, also smiling.
1:38:42|1:38:51|The mother and son are in the hospital corridor, with [Xia Tian] kneeling on the ground, tightly hugging her son who was desperately saved. The scene gradually darkens.
1:38:55|1:39:7|The scene gradually brightens, a year later, on the mountaintop, a camper van is parked on thin snow, with two chairs in front of it, along with a table and some camping gear.
1:39:24|1:39:27|[Xia Tian] walked out of the car holding a small cake.
1:39:56|1:39:58|[Xia Tian] looked at the storybook and smiled happily.
1:40:9|1:40:13|[Dou Dou] put down the book and sat in [Xia Tian]'s arms. [Xia Tian] wrapped [Dou Dou] in a blanket.
1:40:28|1:40:32|[Xia Tian] lightly pushed the water cup on the table, then quickly grabbed it.
