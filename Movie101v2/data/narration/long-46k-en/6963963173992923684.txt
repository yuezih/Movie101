0:2:28|0:2:43|[Ma Jin] heard the news and couldn't help but look at the sun visor in the car. He reached out and opened the sun visor, took out the lottery ticket next to [Shanshan]'s photo, stared at the lottery ticket for a long time, and then tucked it into a book.
0:2:56|0:3:0|[Ma Jin] tried to start the engine of the vehicle upon hearing this, but to no avail.
0:4:39|0:4:46|[Ma Jin] carried a bag to distribute water to everyone, but his eyes were always on [Shanshan]. He quietly took out a hot drink from his pocket and handed it to [Shanshan].
0:4:55|0:5:22|He took the hot drink, gazed for a long time, but gave the hot drink to the person next to him. The bus sped on the city streets, with its yellow body and the shape of a small yellow duck, attracting attention in the city. The bus passed through the crowds, crossed the bridge, and headed towards the port. After a crash sound, accompanied by screams on the bus, the bus rushed into the sea and began to gallop on the water.
0:6:50|0:7:9|Manager Zhang was giving a speech on stage, while Ma Jin was playing games on his phone absentmindedly. With a sound signaling game completion, a notification popped up on his phone, revealing that he had won 60 million. Ma Jin was stunned and incredulous at the sight.
0:7:9|0:7:21|[Ma Jin] quickly took out the lottery ticket sandwiched in the book, holding the phone in one hand and the ticket in the other, comparing them word by word. His face was filled with anxiety and nervousness, yet his eyes showed no sign of slackening.
0:8:20|0:8:42|With the words of the wanderer still echoing, [Xiao Wang] stared straight out the window, [Ma Jin] followed [Xiao Wang]'s gaze and looked outside as well. The two of them had a look of fear in their eyes. Their colleagues, who had snapped out of their daze, also noticed something strange. Suddenly, a towering wave rose up from the calm sea, the deep waves like a wall reaching up to the sky, blocking the bus's path.
0:8:50|0:8:57|[Lao Pan] took Manager Zhang's seat before he could sit down. Manager Zhang gestured for Lao Pan to return to his own seat, but Lao Pan completely ignored him.
0:8:57|0:9:18|The cargo ship was on the verge of capsizing in the huge waves, with the waves pushing it towards the bus. [Xiao Wang] made a quick decision to increase the throttle, pushing the propeller to its maximum power. With a roaring sound, [Xiao Wang] drove the bus towards the huge waves. The cargo ship was battered by the towering waves, causing chaos on board as containers fell into the sea.
0:9:18|0:9:30|The bus continued to shake violently, making it difficult for colleagues inside to control their bodies. The cargo ship, battered by huge waves, struggled to maintain stability. The overturned oil drums on the cargo ship triggered a series of chain explosions instantly.
0:9:30|0:9:54|Above the sea, a fierce fire blazed, causing fear among colleagues. However, the bus, driven by [Xiao Wang], bravely navigated through the flames, searching for a way to safety. The bus, with its small frame, charged towards the capsized cargo ship, entering the giant waves filled with fallen containers. Explosions continued as the bus aimlessly roamed amidst the shockwaves.
0:9:55|0:10:19|At this moment, a whale swam past the bus, and [Ma Jin] even made eye contact with the whale by the window. His face was full of fear, but the whale swam away on its own. However, the huge body of the whale couldn't take care of both ends, and its massive tail heavily slapped on the bus. The screams inside the bus were incessant, and the bus was carried by the current towards the waves.
0:10:20|0:10:28|The bus rushed out from the top of the giant wave, and the people on the bus were terrified. Then, as the giant wave swept down, the bus was submerged in the sea.
0:10:32|0:11:31|On the nameless deserted island. As light rain falls from the sky, a lizard lies on the green rock, tilting its head back to enjoy the rain. Suddenly, it turns its head, as if it has discovered something. It climbs up the rock and finds the bus that had long been swallowed by the huge waves, standing alone on the rock wall. It blinks and sees Xiao Xing with his mouth open, seemingly calling out someone's name.
0:11:32|0:12:6|[Xiao Xing] helped [Ma Jin] up as he woke up, but [Ma Jin] seemed a bit disoriented. With heavy eyes, [Ma Jin] looked around and saw his colleagues either unconscious, praying with prayer beads, or vomiting on the ground. The bus looked particularly dilapidated in the storm. [Manager Zhang] stood on a rock wall, looking helpless in the distance. As [Ma Jin] regained his senses, he surveyed the surroundings.
0:12:6|0:12:21|Surrounded by raging waves and screams of despair, [Ma Jin] still remembered to check if his lottery ticket was safe, even in such dire circumstances.
0:12:22|0:12:31|He opened his backpack, flipped through the book, then closed it. After that, he tucked the book into his arms, afraid of being seen by others.
0:12:59|0:13:11|The dark and oppressive storm clouds over the sea dyed the sky black, with violent waterspouts connecting the sky and the earth. Accompanied by the sound of thunder and lightning, it seemed like a doomsday scene.
0:13:11|0:13:47|The torrential rain, the size of soybeans, couldn't hide the anxiety of [Ma Jin]. [Ma Jin] shuttled through the dense forest in search of [Shanshan]'s trace. However, the small path washed by the rain was particularly muddy and slippery, causing [Ma Jin] to accidentally fall. Inadvertently, he saw a coat hanging on a tree branch. Picking up the coat, [Ma Jin] discovered it belonged to [Shanshan].
0:13:48|0:14:3|At this moment, a scream from [Shanshan] could be heard. [Ma Jin] followed the sound and found [Shanshan] sitting on a rock. [Shanshan] gestured to [Ma Jin] that her foot was stuck, and [Ma Jin] struggled to move the rock to rescue [Shanshan].
0:14:17|0:14:22|The torrential rain on the sea intensified, accompanied by lightning and thunder, giving a sense of apocalyptic doom.
0:14:23|0:14:50|The people on the island scattered to hide in the rock crevices to avoid the rainstorm. After a simple head count, they settled down in the crevices to take shelter from the storm.
0:14:59|0:15:18|The next day, the stranded colleagues huddled in the crevices, looking exhausted. [Xiao Wang] arrived and shouted twice, signaling everyone to follow him.
0:16:48|0:17:2|[Ma Jin] took out his phone, trying to check his winning information. However, as soon as he opened the app, the phone shut down due to low battery. [Ma Jin] looked frustrated and then went to reprimand the arguing crowd.
0:17:40|0:17:44|Manager Zhang grabbed Xiao Wang's collar in anger, glaring at him fiercely.
0:17:54|0:18:2|The appearance of the deserted island gradually emerges, with everyone stranded on the uninhabited and desolate island, standing alone on the sea.
0:19:32|0:19:53|[Xiao Wang] skillfully climbed up the tree, picked the fruit and threw it to the people below. On the sixth day, everyone held up makeshift signal receivers and searched around for signals. After connecting for a while, they only heard noisy radio waves, with no trace of any signal.
0:20:36|0:20:46|A sudden explosion caught everyone's attention, and they turned around to see that the bus was emitting black smoke.
0:20:52|0:21:0|[Xiao Wang] looked at the smoking bus, gritting his teeth in anger.
0:21:33|0:21:45|The lizard on the deserted island looked coldly at everything, with only the abandoned bus and him as lonely companions.
0:22:30|0:22:35|The security guard's impatient attitude left Manager Yu stunned, he turned around and complained to [Manager Zhang].
0:23:31|0:23:36|Shanshan's words surprised Professor, but no one in the audience refuted them.
0:23:50|0:23:55|Xiao Wang's words gave everyone hope, and everyone set off to the cave with Xiao Wang.
0:23:59|0:24:6|Everyone seemed to be exhausted, focusing only on moving forward. Even saying a few words felt tiring.
0:24:15|0:24:26|Everyone felt excited, very satisfied with the internal environment, and even prepared firewood for drilling and making fire.
0:26:10|0:26:21|[Shanshan] stood alone on the cliff, gazing at the distant deep and calm sea. When [Ma Jin] arrived and saw [Shanshan] in such a state, he stood still and didn't disturb her.
0:26:22|0:26:47|[Shanshan] opened her mouth as if to vent her grievances, but before she could speak, [Ma Jin] beat her to it. Giving [Ma Jin] a disdainful look, [Shanshan] turned around to leave. Just as [Ma Jin] finished speaking, [Shanshan] shouted out and then walked away. [Ma Jin] stood there stunned, at a loss, and could only gaze at the distant sea.
0:26:48|0:27:9|[Ma Jin] cautiously returned to the cave, seeing that everyone was already asleep. He quietly went to check on [Shanshan], only to find her leaning against a rock, using her luggage as a pillow, fast asleep. Feeling bored, he found a spot next to [Xiao Xing] and curled up to sleep.
0:27:9|0:27:17|Above the wilderness lies a primitive jungle, and above the jungle hangs the lingering mist of many years.
0:27:42|0:27:47|[Xiao Wang] led everyone in the fishing operation, and he was seen vigorously thrusting a wooden stick into the water.
0:27:55|0:28:20|[Ma Jin] placed the stones on the wooden stakes as markers and then quickly walked away. Climbing the rock wall was very difficult for [Manager Zhang], but [Xiao Wang] quickly climbed up, mocking [Manager Zhang] along the way. The others also swiftly passed [Manager Zhang]. [Manager Zhang] hoped for help but only received a high-five. On the other side, [Ma Jin] was shuttling through the jungle. He was seen crossing through the dark cave with a coat covering his head.
0:28:20|0:28:40|Ma Jin crossed the deep water curtain cave, traveled on the desolate island's small plain, passed through patches of thorny jungles, stepped over skinny and rugged reefs, and finally set foot on the long-lost sea cliff. Looking out, all he could see was a vast expanse of turbulent waves and the endless sea in the distance.
0:28:41|0:28:47|The next day, the persistent [Ma Jin] was still wandering around the deserted island, just to find a way out.
0:29:13|0:29:42|Lucy almost stumbled and grabbed Xiao Wang in front of her, until Xiao Wang felt a little embarrassed. Ma Jin climbed over various terrains in the jungle, trying to find a way out. He looked at the lottery ticket in his hand, watching the 90-day redemption date begin to search for a way out on the deserted island. After finally seeing a glimmer of hope, he walked over and found it was another dead end. He suddenly realized that he was on a deserted island.
0:30:43|0:30:49|[Ma Jin] wanted to step forward and teach [Xiao Wang] a lesson, but was intimidated by Xiao Wang's imposing manner. Seeing Xiao Wang acting high and mighty, Ma Jin felt very aggrieved.
0:30:56|0:31:25|Xiao Wang pressed Ma Jin against the stove, his grimacing expression was terrifying. He looked around and with a single move, subdued Ma Jin to the ground. Everyone was frightened by Xiao Wang's words. At night, to punish Ma Jin, Xiao Wang hung him upside down on a tree. Xiao Xing sneaked out at night to look for Ma Jin.
0:31:50|0:32:6|Early in the morning, [Xiao Xing] and [Ma Jin] were planning something on the rocks. [Ma Jin] noticed that the stone he threw didn't skip, which made him lost in thought.
0:33:42|0:33:47|Listening to Shanshan's words, Ma Jin was momentarily at a loss.
0:33:58|0:34:2|[Ma Jin] turned around and was about to leave, but he glanced back at [Shanshan].
0:34:4|0:34:36|[Ma Jin] was unwilling in his heart, he walked quickly towards [Shanshan], trying to force a kiss on her. [Shanshan] reached out her hand to block [Ma Jin]. The two of them were at a standstill. Seeing this, [Ma Jin] kissed [Shanshan]'s fingers. [Shanshan] felt disgusted and quickly let go of [Ma Jin]. She crossed her arms and looked at [Ma Jin] warily. [Ma Jin] glanced at [Shanshan] and took out a packet of instant noodles from his bag to give to her.
0:34:45|0:35:2|As soon as the words fell, [Ma Jin] picked up his bag and left. [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] were paddling the boat vigorously, standing on the reef, watching [Ma Jin] sail away.
0:35:28|0:35:40|[Ma Jin] rowed the boat, his foot accidentally fell into the water, and when he lifted it, he realized his shoe was missing. [Ma Jin] searched around in the water for his shoe, but to no avail.
0:35:42|0:35:53|At night, [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] were drifting alone on the sea in a small boat. The next day, just as the sky was getting light, [Xiao Xing] seemed to have discovered something.
0:35:59|0:36:18|He paddled hard to bring the boat closer to the floating object, used the oar to push the floating object, and found that it was a dead polar bear. [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] stared in shock at the polar bear.
0:36:57|0:37:2|[Xiao Wang] scolded [Ma Jin] and then turned around and left. The rest of the people began to mock [Ma Jin].
0:37:48|0:38:30|[Ma Jin] exerted all his strength to throw [Xiao Xing] against the rock wall. [Xiao Xing] wiped the blood from his nose and ignored [Ma Jin]. Feeling aggrieved, [Xiao Xing] looked at the unfamiliar [Ma Jin] and didn't know what to say. With that, [Ma Jin] stopped talking and [Xiao Xing] got up and left him.
0:39:4|0:39:30|Manager Zhang stood away from the crowd, alone, took out his wallet, gently looked down at the photo of his wife and child in the wallet. The sea breeze lightly brushed his face, as if making a decision for him. Manager Zhang took out the money from the wallet without any hesitation and scattered it into the air. The money flew around with the sea breeze, but at this moment, money and status held no allure. Everyone just watched, gazing at the money silently drifting in the wind.
0:39:51|0:40:8|In response to Ma Jin's call, Xiao Xing walked away without looking back. Ma Jin felt bored and lowered his head to fix his shoes. Shanshan walked over and handed him a piece of cloth to secure them.
0:40:48|0:40:55|Manager Zhang and Ma Jin were wandering aimlessly in the jungle.
0:42:55|0:43:6|Manager Zhang finished speaking, his gaze sweeping around the crowd.
0:44:20|0:44:30|[Manager Zhang]'s impassioned speech inspired everyone, and [Ma Jin] led the applause.
0:45:1|0:45:11|[Professor] was busy eating and ignoring [Xiao Wang] beside him. His mouth was full of food and he couldn't speak, which angered [Xiao Wang].
0:45:24|0:45:31|Manager Zhang nodded and looked around.
0:45:35|0:45:48|Manager Zhang raised his hand as soon as he finished speaking, and like-minded people also raised their hands one after another. Professor raised his hand, then touched his head and put it down.
0:46:24|0:46:32|Late at night, [Manager Zhang] led everyone through the woods with a torch, [Ma Jin] couldn't help but feel doubtful.
0:46:36|0:46:44|[Ma Jin] and his group were holding torches as they passed through the rocky beach. It seemed like [Ma Jin] had discovered something.
0:46:54|0:47:17|Manager Zhang gestured to Ma Jin to leave, the deserted island jungle was silent in the dark night, and the bright torches stood out in the deep night.
0:47:17|0:47:31|The torches dispersed the deathly silence of the night, and [Ma Jin] and his group navigated through the jungle in the mist. As the mist cleared, they finally reached the end of their journey.
0:47:31|0:47:45|[Ma Jin] and his group walked down the stairs into the cabin, where the dim torchlight dispelled the unknown for everyone, allowing [Ma Jin] and his group to explore the full view of the cabin.
0:48:9|0:48:16|[Ma Jin] found a shoe in the cabin, which made him particularly happy.
0:48:54|0:49:8|The next day, with the waves gently lapping the beach and the sea breeze brushing the weeds growing on the deck, [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] rubbed their sleepy eyes and walked out of the cabin, finally able to explore the full view of the cabin.
0:49:16|0:49:41|Originally, it was a half-ship stranded and overturned on the shore, resembling a huge fortress. [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] walked along the shallows with wooden sticks, stabbing at the fish in the water. They drove the fish towards the fishing net that had been set up in advance. When the net was pulled up, the two of them harvested a net full of fish. [Ma Jin] couldn't help but sing excitedly.
0:50:30|0:50:39|[Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] playfully frolic on the beach, watching the sunset.
0:50:49|0:50:57|[Shanshan] struggled to lift the fish trap out of the water, only to find it full of fish, getting wet in the rain.
0:51:6|0:51:14|Ma Jin's sudden appearance made Shanshan understand where the fish came from. She looked up at Ma Jin.
0:52:19|0:52:34|[Ma Jin] took [Shanshan] to the cabin to take a bath. Watching [Shanshan] grooming in front of the mirror, she applied lipstick while looking at herself in the mirror.
0:53:23|0:53:35|Shanshan was shouting loudly on the deck, while Ma Jin was standing beside her, looking at her tenderly as if wanting to see forever.
0:53:45|0:53:56|[Shanshan] lights a lighter for [Ma Jin], who has already changed into his costume and is humming a rhythm as he dances with [Shanshan], who is also extremely happy.
0:55:0|0:55:9|[Ma Jin] watched as [Shanshan] walked away, extinguishing the lighter in his hand. Little did he know that [Manager Zhang] would reignite it.
0:55:46|0:55:52|Xiao Wang tasted a glass of wine in the cabin.
0:59:11|0:59:37|[Ma Jin] took out the card that Manager [Zhang] had just given him. In the end, he threw the card on the ground and walked away without looking back. [Zhang] and Manager Yu picked up the card, watching as [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] walked away. [Zhang] watched as [Ma Jin] and the others walked further and further away.
0:59:39|0:59:49|On the deserted island, a stream flows horizontally, [Ma Jin] sits alone on the rocky beach, looking even older.
0:59:54|1:0:7|[Xiao Xing] finished tidying up the cabin, looked at [Ma Jin] who was staring blankly at the rocky beach, [Ma Jin] glanced at the redemption date on the lottery ticket, and casually tore off a calendar page.
1:0:12|1:0:28|Life on the island is particularly decadent. Apart from sitting paralyzed in bed, [Ma Jin] either goes fishing or tears off a page from the calendar.
1:0:35|1:0:57|Manager Zhang and Manager Yu were laughing loudly on the deck with their wine glasses, while the others were busy tidying up the fishing nets and drying the freshly caught fish. Ma Jin was hiding in the distant forest, watching Shanshan washing clothes in the stream. Ma Jin pursed his lips, looking hesitant and conflicted. The days on the calendar were rapidly decreasing, and in the blink of an eye, ten days had disappeared without a trace.
1:0:57|1:1:20|Life on the deserted island remained unchanged, with the waves still surging relentlessly day after day against the shore. [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] still hadn't found a way out, standing on the rocks in the waves, watching the rushing sea. Days flew by rapidly, as [Ma Jin] watched the calendar pages being torn off one by one.
1:1:29|1:1:42|As the days passed by, [Ma Jin] tore off the calendar pages one by one. Seeing the deadline for cashing in the prize approaching, [Ma Jin] despairingly shouted by the seaside, with only [Xiao Xing] by his side.
1:1:52|1:1:58|[Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] set foot on [Manager Zhang]'s territory again, attracting the attention of everyone present.
1:2:22|1:2:28|Hearing Xiao Xing's words, Manager Zhang pretended to be surprised and after some thought, he agreed to him.
1:2:37|1:2:42|[Ma Jin] got up from the ground and asked Manager Yu for the fishing net.
1:2:54|1:3:14|[Ma Jin] reached out and slapped Yang Hong, who became angry and directly hit [Ma Jin] to the ground. Yang Hong took a step forward, only to be punched back by [Ma Jin]. Manager Zhang, standing at a distance with a glass of wine, looked coldly at all this. Suddenly, Xiao Xing came out and hit Yang Hong with a stick.
1:3:24|1:3:30|Manager Zhang stood in the distance holding a glass of wine, watching everything. Xiao Xing collapsed on the ground, while Ma Jin tried to take him away.
1:3:43|1:4:1|[Ma Jin] leaned heavily on a tree stump with numerous wounds, while [Xiao Xing] weakly opened his eyes beside him. [Ma Jin] was panting heavily with blood in his mouth, looking disheveled and exhausted, turning his weary eyes to gaze at Manager Zhang in the distance.
1:4:1|1:4:35|He saw Shanshan talking to Manager Zhang and boarding the cabin with him. Ma Jin couldn't help but recall what he had said before. At this moment, Ma Jin felt a deep pain, watching Shanshan enter the cabin. Thinking about their past, Ma Jin was heartbroken and speechless.
1:4:35|1:5:2|At night, [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] returned to their residence. Suddenly, they heard some noise outside and grabbed stones and sticks, preparing to attack. To their surprise, the person who arrived was [Shanshan]. [Ma Jin] then let down his guard.
1:5:16|1:5:24|Shanshan looked speechless, then took out a fish from her bag and placed it on the rock in front of Ma Jin.
1:5:39|1:5:51|Shanshan suddenly felt wronged, looking straight at Ma Jin, who remained silent. In annoyance, Shanshan directly threw the bag to Ma Jin and left without looking back.
1:5:52|1:6:7|[Ma Jin] shook his head indifferently, then stood up and threw the bag into the river. [Xiao Xing] felt helpless as he saw the fish being thrown away.
1:6:14|1:6:31|Days passed by, [Ma Jin] lay on the rocks, covered in wounds, with cracked lips, looking like a dying man. Today is the last day to claim the prize, [Ma Jin] stared blankly at the sky.
1:6:52|1:7:23|[Ma Jin] seemed not to hear, staring blankly at the lottery ticket in his hand. Suddenly, a fish hit the ground in front of [Ma Jin]. He stared at the fish on the ground in a daze, and then it started raining from the sky. Another fish fell in front of [Ma Jin]. He looked up at the sky and saw more and more fish falling towards him. As the rain grew heavier, more fish fell. [Ma Jin] tried hard to dodge the fish attacks, but the falling fish were as dense as raindrops. With no way to avoid them, [Ma Jin] and the person with him on the rocky beach were at their wits' end.
1:7:23|1:7:43|The two were brutally beaten by the falling fish, struggling to move their bodies to find a place to hide from this fish disaster. Unexpectedly, before they could find shelter, they were knocked down by the falling fish on the rocky beach. The two curled up on the rocky beach, as if they were about to give up struggling. However, the falling fish did not stop there, instead of rain, they turned the sky into their own battlefield.
1:7:43|1:7:56|[Ma Jin] looked at the fish falling from the sky, unable to see the rain anymore, letting the fish hit him. [Ma Jin] and the other person curled up on the rocky beach, had long given up any struggle, blending with the rocks and falling fish.
1:7:57|1:8:10|After a long time, the torrential rain suddenly stopped, [Ma Jin] stood up again, looking at the fish scattered on the rocky beach and the lottery tickets torn to pieces. [Ma Jin] was speechless, unsure whether to be happy or sad.
1:8:10|1:8:22|While Ma Jin was in a daze, Xiao Xing had already piled up the fish into a small mountain and started grilling them over the fire. Xiao Xing stuffed the grilled fish into his mouth in big bites, seeking to avenge the beating he received.
1:8:22|1:8:44|On the other hand, [Ma Jin] had a poor appetite. Standing up and looking around, all he could see were the fallen fish scattered on the rocky beach and the piles of fallen fish stacked up by [Xiao Xing]. The place where [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] stayed had already been taken over by the fallen fish. It was unclear whose territory it was, leaving [Ma Jin] feeling a mix of joy and sorrow.
1:11:6|1:11:24|[Ma Jin] tiptoed to the side of the bathroom, hesitated on how to speak up, pretended to be calm as he glanced at the bathroom,
1:11:33|1:11:54|[Ma Jin] fidgeted with his coat outside the bathroom, looking as nervous as a maiden. He carried two buckets of water and poured them into the bathroom's water tank. Suddenly, [Shanshan] exclaimed in surprise.
1:12:22|1:12:30|Suddenly, the door of the bathroom opened, but the person who walked out was not [Shanshan].
1:12:48|1:13:7|Ma Jin, who came to his senses, turned around to look at the bathroom, but did not find any trace of Shanshan. Shanshan was staring at him on the rock wall. She stood on the rock wall, looking at the surprised Ma Jin, and couldn't help but show a smile that had been separated for a long time. The island was still shrouded in mist, and the days remained unchanged.
1:15:12|1:15:20|Xiao Wang looked at Manager Zhang's arrogant face, feeling a surge of courage. Suddenly, he gritted his teeth and made a swift move like a carp leaping over the dragon gate.
1:15:23|1:15:31|With a command from [Xiao Wang], a battle for resources erupted on the rocky beach, and the two sides instantly engaged in a fierce struggle for scarce survival resources.
1:15:42|1:15:54|Shanshan searched everywhere but couldn't find Ma Jin's whereabouts. Little did she know that Ma Jin and Xiao Xing were watching the team battle from a distance on the rocky beach. The battle on the rocky beach intensified, with both sides fighting fiercely for survival, refusing to back down.
1:16:1|1:16:14|Yang Hong was unfortunately subdued, Manager Zhang saw the situation was not good, and hurriedly escaped into the cabin with Lao Pan. Manager Zhang saw the cabin door open, but Lao Pan went in and closed the door, leaving Manager Zhang alone outside.
1:16:16|1:16:34|[Manager Zhang] banged on the cabin door in frustration, but there was no sign of it opening. Seeing this, [Xiao Wang] grabbed [Manager Zhang] by the back of his neck and pushed him to the ground. The fierce battle on the rocky beach continued, with both sides showing no mercy as if they had deep-seated grudges.
1:16:44|1:17:3|Above the sky, the wind and clouds change constantly, day and night rotate, the great battle continues into the night without stopping. At this moment, [Shanshan] rushed back, trying to intervene but was overturned to the ground. The battle rages on, with people seeming like madmen, entangled in a chaotic fight on the rocky beach.
1:17:6|1:17:16|Suddenly, a beam of bright light lit up on the spaceship, waking up everyone on the rocky beach. People shielded their eyes from the dazzling light, trying to see where it was coming from, only to find themselves in front of the lamp.
1:17:26|1:17:34|[Xiao Xing] vigorously shakes the generator next to [Ma Jin].
1:20:40|1:21:4|The midnight bell rang, and the violence on the rocky beach had ceased. Everyone gathered together to cook instant noodles. [Ma Jin] tore open the seasoning packet and sprinkled it into the pot. The dust scattered in the blowing steam, but no one felt it was pungent. They still gazed at the floating dust in the air, watching the boiling noodle soup in the pot. When the noodles were cooked, [Ma Jin] was the first to pick up a strand of noodles with chopsticks.
1:21:4|1:21:10|The crowd watched as Ma Jin lifted the steaming noodles, his face beaming with a happy smile.
1:21:10|1:21:27|[Ma Jin] packed instant noodles for everyone, ladled hot soup into a bowl, and handed it to the dejected [Xiao Wang] on the side, reuniting everyone once again. [Xiao Wang] took the noodles, bowed his head, took a bite, and a tear rolled down his cheek.
1:21:37|1:21:50|[Ma Jin] led the applause, and everyone couldn't help but burst into tears when they heard this, holding their heads and crying bitterly, with each cry louder than the last. It seemed as if this was to announce the end of the factional struggles on the deserted island, bringing everyone back together.
1:21:50|1:22:14|At this moment, [Shanshan] was looking at [Ma Jin] serving noodles to everyone with special attention. She quickly walked to the noodle pot and served a bowl of noodles for the busy [Ma Jin]. [Ma Jin] also noticed [Shanshan]'s actions, so [Shanshan] handed the bowl and fork to [Ma Jin]. [Ma Jin] took them, looking at [Shanshan] with a smile in his eyes. [Shanshan] responded with a smile as well.
1:23:4|1:23:20|The longing of everyone was hard to contain, they all clung to [Ma Jin], wanting to catch a glimpse of their family. [Xiao Xing] shook the generator to charge the phones. A long line formed outside the cabin as everyone wanted to see their family.
1:23:28|1:23:40|Life on the deserted island gradually improved, with the men starting to bathe in the pond. When [Sister Qi] arrived, everyone was caught off guard and quickly hid behind rocks in the water, afraid to show themselves.
1:23:42|1:23:48|[Shanshan] and the sisters are tidying up the sun-filled sheets.
1:23:56|1:24:5|Lucy, wearing a deep V-neck top, was jumping rope, her figure bouncing up and down with the movement, revealing everything. This scene caught the attention of the male survivors on the deserted island.
1:24:5|1:24:24|In the forest, towering trees collapsed one by one, and [Ma Jin] and the others started a civil engineering project. They were seen energetically swinging their axes, while [Ma Jin] was busy rescuing the bus. He looked at the simple blueprint in his hand, trying to set up a wooden frame next to the bus and use the lever principle to rescue the bus from the encirclement of the rocks.
1:24:25|1:24:47|Lao Pan, who was just shocked and injured by electricity, regains consciousness and flails his arms as he emerges from the water. Ma Jin stands by, watching all this with relief. As the project comes to an end, everyone gathers in groups of three or four, either standing, sitting, or leaning against the banyan tree, chatting and enjoying themselves.
1:24:47|1:24:55|[Ma Jin] and [Shanshan] were enjoying their own world, while [Manager Zhang] and his small group were gazing at the sea, comforting themselves.
1:24:55|1:25:11|On the deserted island, everyone made the best of a bad situation and started skipping rope together. While others were playing, [Xiao Xing] was moving stones by the stream to control the water flow. He also used scrap iron pieces to make a water wheel, successfully developing a simple water-powered generator that illuminated the pitch-black night.
1:25:12|1:25:34|As the music plays, everyone gathers around the bonfire and dances with abandon, cheering and laughing, enjoying the whole night. Even [Xiao Wang] and [Manager Zhang], who are usually at odds, embrace each other and dance gracefully. [Xiao Xing] also stands on the deck dancing, shouting with joy, releasing the pent-up frustration of the past few days.
1:25:49|1:26:12|[Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] lazily leaned against the boat, watching the people dancing below. In a hurry, [Manager Zhang] walked up to [Xiao Xing], only to see him throwing a playing card towards [Manager Zhang]. This unexpected scene caused a commotion among the crowd. [Xiao Xing] picked up more cards and threw them down.
1:26:23|1:26:46|[Ma Jin] stood up, stood at the edge of the boat with his back facing outwards. He opened his arms and let out a loud roar before falling backwards. The people below went even more crazy, reaching out their hands to welcome the falling [Ma Jin].
1:26:49|1:26:54|The party ended, and everyone gathered together to watch a long-lost movie.
1:27:14|1:27:28|After Professor Shi finished explaining, he passed the cone diagram to everyone to review. Manager Zhang was not convinced by this, but still took out a deck of cards and handed it to Xiao Xing.
1:27:57|1:28:6|Hearing Ma Jin's words, Shanshan couldn't help but applaud. In the dreamlike forest, there were only Shanshan and Ma Jin, walking through the woods on moss-covered ground.
1:28:27|1:28:46|[Shanshan], wearing a flower crown, looked affectionately at [Ma Jin]. She reached out her hand to [Ma Jin], her smile becoming brighter and brighter. Suddenly, behind [Shanshan], colorful and translucent wings spread open. [Ma Jin] stared at her, becoming more and more entranced. The sound of a drop of water falling into a pond startled [Ma Jin].
1:28:46|1:28:55|[Ma Jin] looked at [Shanshan], who was entangled with him, and couldn't help but feel stunned.
1:29:12|1:29:30|Facing Shanshan's inquiry, Ma Jin just waved his hand, still smiling at Shanshan, with laughter and music continuing, the party has not stopped, Ma Jin is falling.
1:29:32|1:29:36|The crowd had already extended their hands, waiting for the arrival of [Ma Jin].
1:29:36|1:29:59|[Ma Jin] also joined the crowd in the celebration, intensifying the atmosphere. He even lifted [Shanshan] up, while [Xiao Wang] was wrapped in light strips, twisting his body. On the side, [Manager Zhang] was smoking a cigar and holding a glass of wine, swaying to the music. [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] got more and more excited as they played, performing a duet dance one after the other.
1:29:59|1:30:13|[Manager Zhang] completely abandoned his image, bowing his body and shaking his head. Suddenly, a heavy roar interrupted everyone's revelry.
1:30:28|1:30:34|Xiao Wang, wrapped in fairy lights, rushed to the front, followed by Ma Jin and Xiao Xing.
1:31:6|1:31:34|[Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] arrived at the edge of the cliff, where Xiao Xing seemed to have discovered something. They looked at what was on the edge of the cliff, and the roaring sound echoed again. Ma Jin saw a brightly lit cruise ship sailing on the sea, with dazzling fireworks still being set off on the cruise ship, indicating the presence of light.
1:31:49|1:31:57|[Xiao Wang]'s hoarse shouts were in vain,
1:32:16|1:32:25|[Ma Jin] looked at the ship with a strange expression, holding a branch and randomly chopping around, venting his anger.
1:32:30|1:32:39|[Ma Jin] looked ferocious, spitting saliva towards the sky.
1:32:49|1:33:11|[Ma Jin] angrily curses the heavens, looking at the dazzling cruise ship with an exceptionally low expression. [Xiao Xing] remains silent for a long time beside him, and the fireworks on the cruise ship do not stop because of his cursing. [Ma Jin] walks away desolately.
1:33:36|1:33:58|[Ma Jin] stood still after saying these words, unsure of what to do next. [Xiao Xing] gazed in the direction where [Xiao Wang] had disappeared, with a determined look in his eyes. Suddenly, [Xiao Xing] briskly approached [Ma Jin], lifting his head that had been lowered for a long time. The expression on [Xiao Xing]'s face was particularly cold and under the moonlight, it appeared even more sinister.
1:35:44|1:35:51|[Xiao Wang] looked around at everyone who remained unmoved.
1:36:32|1:36:40|Xiao Xing signaled everyone to subdue the crazed Xiao Wang.
1:36:52|1:36:59|Everyone in the cabin chased after the fleeing Xiao Wang and together they locked him in the refrigerator.
1:37:8|1:37:18|[Xiao Xing] quickly brought the stun gun over and connected it to the refrigerator. After opening the refrigerator, [Xiao Wang] immediately fainted on the ground.
1:38:29|1:38:39|[Shanshan] looked at [Ma Jin] beside her, but couldn't give a reply.
1:39:3|1:39:7|After Shanshan finished speaking, she broke free from Ma Jin's hand and left, leaving Ma Jin standing in place.
1:39:11|1:39:33|Late at night, the bus stood alone on the rocks, looking particularly lonely. [Ma Jin] came to the side of the rocks alone, staring at the bus in a daze. Suddenly, lightning flashed across the sky, followed by cold raindrops falling from the sky. [Ma Jin] continued to gaze at the bus in front of him, lost in thought.
1:39:35|1:39:40|Time flies, and now it has been 132 days since Ma Jin arrived on the island.
1:41:23|1:41:41|Upon hearing Manager Zhang's words, Xiao Xing couldn't help but sneer, and then took out his phone.
1:43:22|1:43:38|[Ma Jin] looked at [Xiao Xing]'s expression, not knowing how to advise him. Manager [Zhang] quickly prepared the contract, stamped it, and handed it to [Xiao Xing]. [Xiao Xing] then took out his phone to start recording.
1:43:58|1:44:4|Feeling particularly unfamiliar, [Xiao Xing] received the contract and immediately handed the phone to [Manager Zhang].
1:44:34|1:44:43|[Ma Jin] didn't know how to refute it after hearing that.
1:45:0|1:45:10|[Ma Jin] looked at the unfamiliar face of [Xiao Xing], hesitated for a long time, and opened his mouth.
1:45:50|1:46:2|[Ma Jin] looked at [Xiao Xing], who appeared particularly indifferent, but couldn't say a word.
1:46:6|1:46:13|[Xiao Xing] finished speaking and left, leaving [Ma Jin] standing there in a daze.
1:46:21|1:46:32|Suddenly, [Ma Jin] was blindfolded with a sheet and taken away from the scene.
1:46:39|1:47:5|[Ma Jin] was being carried and started to move. Through the gap in the sheets, he saw himself being carried to a rocky beach. He struggled frantically, trying to break free from the people around him, but was pressed directly onto the sofa on the rocky beach. His expression in the sheets was particularly fearful. Suddenly, the sheets were lifted, and [Shanshan] rushed in. [Ma Jin] couldn't help but widen his eyes.
1:47:30|1:47:40|[Ma Jin] heard tears flowing uncontrollably from the corners of his eyes, while [Shanshan] lifted the blanket to reveal her love to everyone.
1:48:21|1:48:29|[Ma Jin] stood there in a daze.
1:48:34|1:48:48|Seeing that [Ma Jin] did not respond, everyone pulled up [Ma Jin], lifted him and [Shanshan] high up, but [Ma Jin]'s expression was somewhat smiling yet not smiling.
1:49:24|1:49:31|[Ma Jin] rolled around on the rocky beach, shouting nonsensically.
1:50:45|1:51:12|Lao Pan grabbed Ma Jin trying to subdue him, and the security guard quickly came forward to stun both Ma Jin and Lao Pan. Ma Jin lay weakly on the rocky beach, while Xiao Xing watched coldly. When Ma Jin woke up and squatted by the river, Xiao Wang even threw stones at him, coming to tease him.
1:51:25|1:51:36|Ma Jin, who came to his senses, tried to return to the cabin but was stopped.
1:52:12|1:52:39|[Ma Jin] and [Sister Qi]'s words were all seen by [Xiao Xing]. Days passed by, the waves still washed the shore day after day. [Ma Jin] still had a dull look, showing no interest in anything, still sitting around the island in a daze. But the flame of hope in [Shanshan]'s heart was still not extinguished. She couldn't let go of [Ma Jin] and came specially to seek confirmation.
1:53:18|1:53:39|[Ma Jin] responded to [Shanshan]'s questions with a big laugh, refusing to answer while laughing uncontrollably. [Ma Jin] kept laughing to cover up his helplessness.
1:54:22|1:54:36|[Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing]'s conversation was seen by [Xiao Wang],
1:54:52|1:54:59|Late at night, a party is held again on the rocky beach, with [Xiao Wang] and [Ma Jin] performing a lion dance together.
1:55:51|1:56:7|Taking advantage of the crowd's excitement, [Xiao Wang] sneaked into the cabin and used an axe to smash the oil pipe of the ship.
1:57:45|1:57:51|[Xiao Wang] desperately tried to ignite the crude oil with a lighter, but the lighter just wouldn't spark.
1:58:29|1:58:41|Ma Jin was surrounded by everyone on the rocky beach, trying to snatch the torch from him. Suddenly, Xiao Wang leaped out from the side and grabbed the torch, but he was also surrounded by everyone.
1:58:46|1:59:6|[Ma Jin], who managed to break free, cooperated with [Xiao Wang] to move through the crowd. [Ma Jin] took the opportunity to drink a mouthful of strong liquor and sprayed it towards the torch, igniting a blazing fire to disperse the crowd. [Xiao Xing] seized the chance to pull [Ma Jin] to his side and questioned him.
1:59:24|1:59:38|[Ma Jin] stole the book from [Xiao Xing]'s bag while distracting, meanwhile [Xiao Wang] waved a torch trying to set the ship on fire. The torch with a long tail landed at [Shanshan]'s feet.
1:59:59|2:0:11|[Shanshan] had just finished speaking when she handed the torch heavily to the ship. Seeing this, everyone couldn't help but scream, but unfortunately, fate played a trick, and the torch fell into the water and went out.
2:0:20|2:0:26|[Manager Zhang] walked out of the cabin with a cigar in his mouth, causing everyone to scream again.
2:0:37|2:0:53|[Ma Jin] picked up the stun gun, and before Manager Zhang could finish speaking, he was already trembling. The cigar in his hand fell onto the deck. The fierce fire scared off the crowd, but Xiao Xing still stepped forward to challenge Ma Jin for the book.
2:0:58|2:1:21|[Xiao Xing] hoarsely roared, looking like a madman, [Ma Jin] took the opportunity to push [Xiao Xing] down, quickly stepped onto the ship's stairs, and then threw the book into the flames. The book was seen swiftly shuttling in the flames as if trying to avoid the flames' destruction, but the flames had already taken over the surrounding space. Only a heavy thud was heard as the book fell onto the flames.
2:1:21|2:1:32|Engulfed in flames in an instant, [Xiao Xing] saw his books burning, unable to bear the grief, he could only hear him shouting loudly, as if he wanted to rush into the flames to save the books.
2:1:32|2:1:52|[Ma Jin] saw [Xiao Xing] about to rush into the flames, hurriedly hugged the crazed [Xiao Xing]. He heard [Xiao Xing] roaring loudly, swinging his arms wildly towards the flames, looking extremely ferocious. Unable to break free from [Ma Jin]'s hold, [Xiao Xing] could only watch helplessly as his beloved books were consumed by the flames.
2:1:52|2:2:10|[Xiao Xing] saw the books turning into ashes, feeling a sense of unwillingness in his heart. His roar became sharper and sharper. As the fire on the steamship grew larger and spread wider, everyone picked up water buckets to join the firefighting efforts, but it was already too late to save the situation.
2:2:11|2:2:38|At this moment, the firefighting efforts were minimal, and the incoming ship was engulfed by flames. The sorrow in everyone's hearts was hard to conceal as they sat paralyzed on the rocky beach, crying uncontrollably, feeling that their lives would be consumed by the raging fire. They all shifted their anger and resentment onto [Ma Jin]. The flames shot up into the sky, illuminating the pitch-black night, but the people felt no warmth, only bone-chilling cold.
2:2:49|2:2:57|[Ma Jin] was wandering around in the jungle in a panic, but ended up forcing himself to the edge of a cliff. With his own inertia still present, [Ma Jin] unfortunately slipped and fell off the cliff.
2:2:57|2:3:16|Falling, [Ma Jin] saw the explosion caused by the burning ship on one side, with flames soaring into the sky, lighting up the night sky. He also saw a ship approaching on the sea, the towering flames catching the attention of the ship. A spotlight from the ship shone on [Ma Jin]'s face.
2:3:16|2:3:25|[Ma Jin] saw the situation and performed a diving motion in the air. With a thud, [Ma Jin] landed in the water contentedly.
2:3:31|2:3:47|[Ma Jin] immersed himself in the sea, recalling the past life on the island, remembering the smiles of everyone, his mind filled with the laughter of each person. [Ma Jin] gradually fell silent in the sea, but his face still exuded a satisfied smile.
2:4:32|2:4:41|[Ma Jin] opened his arms and enjoyed everything in the embrace of the sea, intoxicated and gradually lost consciousness.
2:4:41|2:5:25|The next day, [Ma Jin] lay limp on the shore. With the gentle touch of the waves, he opened his eyes, gradually regaining consciousness. He struggled to regain control of his body, propping himself up with his exhausted body and standing up again. He dragged his heavy feet back to the ship, only to find that the ship had long disappeared, leaving behind wreckage indicating its past existence. The sudden sound of falling rocks caught [Ma Jin]'s attention.
2:5:27|2:5:54|[Ma Jin] looked up and saw [Shanshan] sitting on a rock, looking at him. On the deserted island, [Ma Jin] awkwardly gazed at [Shanshan], and they looked at each other.
