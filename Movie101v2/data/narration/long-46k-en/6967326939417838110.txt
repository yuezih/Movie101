0:2:50|0:3:9|The unruly steed continued to gallop forward, while the group turned towards another intersection. The pursuers on the sand dune charged ahead, shouting excitedly, completely unaware that they were chasing in the wrong direction.
0:3:10|0:3:30|The yellow sand scattered freely among the chasing herd of horses. In the shadow of a giant rock, [William] at the front looked at the pursuers leaving and nodded towards the others. Without slackening, the group changed direction and continued to flee, their shadows lengthened by the desert sun.
0:3:33|0:3:41|At night, a person is bandaging a thigh wound by the fire, with [William] and [Pero] watching coldly, [William] looking resentful.
0:5:30|0:5:47|A strange wind blew in, causing the flames of the torch to flicker. Just as the two by the fire looked up, a blurry figure darted past. Attacked by an unknown entity, [William] and [Pero] quickly sharpened their focus, drawing their swords cautiously towards the fire.
0:5:50|0:6:1|In front of them was only a lonely bonfire. Looking around, [Pero] noticed a trail of fresh blood on the ground.
0:6:2|0:6:10|A strange noise is heard, the two stand back to back holding their swords defensively. [Pero] nervously says:
0:6:20|0:6:29|[William] raised his long sword high and struck with all his might, cutting off a beast's claw. He slashed horizontally and vertically, and with two consecutive strikes, the monster fell off the cliff.
0:6:45|0:6:59|Crossing the desert, the land gradually became more vegetated. On a small path, [William] and [Pero] rode on horseback. In the distance behind them, the sound of galloping horses could be heard, and the two turned around to see the Khitan people approaching.
0:7:5|0:7:28|After speaking, the two of them hurried towards the mountain, with several riders holding bows and whips chasing after them, already reaching the narrow mountain path. The winding path was filled with flying dust, and the Khitan people were in high spirits. The two rode their horses up the path, while the pursuers shouted and brandished large knives closely behind them.
0:7:28|0:7:47|Climbing over the steep slope, leaving a trail of dust behind, the two sides drew closer and closer. The Khitan people began to get excited. [Pero] glanced back, then urged his horse to catch up with [William], the two of them riding up a hill. However, they ended up standing there dumbfounded.
0:7:59|0:8:11|With a command from the generals, a rain of arrows fell to the ground, forming a circle trapping the two individuals. Hundreds of soldiers in armor and holding spears, the towering Great Wall loomed in front of them.
0:8:12|0:8:35|On the city wall, there were hundreds of archers wearing soft armor, drawing their bows and waiting to release. The cavalry on the wall road was orderly, marching in formation, and the tall beacon tower was emitting thick smoke. The two turned their horses around and looked back at the Khitan people approaching.
0:8:49|0:8:55|[William] took the lead in dismounting, and the two of them walked towards the city wall with their hands raised high.
0:9:5|0:9:9|[William] gave him a glare, and the two of them dropped their weapons in unison.
0:9:18|0:9:24|Three generals, wearing various specially made armors, cloaks, and waist knives, walked proudly and confidently.
0:9:36|0:9:51|In the center, [Female General] slowly raised her head, and a fierce and terrifying beast claw was thrown on the table in the military camp. Four generals stepped forward to inspect it.
0:11:22|0:11:48|Upstairs, the foreigner secretly observed as the soldiers approached and opened the two men's clothes, revealing the armor underneath. [Female General] drew her sword and pointed it directly at [William]'s neck. On the stage, [Dian Shuai] frowned and advised, "[Female General], raise your sword," after a moment of hesitation, she snorted coldly and sheathed her sword.
0:11:50|0:11:58|He then continued to report forward.
0:12:33|0:12:39|The sentry entered the door and quickly went downstairs to report the military situation.
0:12:46|0:12:51|The sentry received the order and ran out quickly, while the tightly coordinated drumming on the city tower was intimidating.
0:12:52|0:12:58|Gazing at the steep mountains in the distance, the winding Great Wall sprawls across them, with beacon towers emitting smoke signals.
0:13:3|0:13:10|Inside the city, [Female General] and [Counselor Wang] are escorting two individuals.
0:13:56|0:14:2|The team arrived at the entrance of the warehouse, where the young soldier was frantically searching for the keys.
0:14:10|0:14:17|On the beacon tower, the soldiers and generals were waiting in formation, with [Dian Shuai] looking solemn. At this moment, [Counselor Wang] strode over.
0:14:22|0:14:38|The well-trained infantry troops at the gate rushed towards the city wall. The team escorting [William] arrived at the gate, and the huge door slowly opened, with water flowing inside hitting the water wheel.
0:14:48|0:15:0|The bare-bodied guards worked together to turn the wheel, the sound of machinery echoed as the cage was slowly lifted by the hemp rope. Passing through each floor of the attic, the soldiers inside were all preparing for battle.
0:15:4|0:15:14|Some soldiers and warriors are holding torches, some are forging iron, the gears of the mechanism are slowly turning. At the top, there is a vermilion bird locked in bronze.
0:15:17|0:15:36|The Vermilion Bird slowly rises to the surface of the Great Wall, where soldiers are lined up neatly. Not far away, a column of imperial guards escorts two people over, while the Vermilion Bird mechanism on the side slowly rises, unfolding four iron bridges for one person each.
0:15:38|0:16:3|Imperial Guard Commander with a spear in hand forced [William] and another person into a corner. The two looked towards the Great Wall, where a catapult slowly emerged from the towering wall. Beside it, a young soldier shouted, "On the main road of the wall, the female general and infantry are marching in two separate formations, in an orderly manner."
0:16:3|0:16:12|[Female General] handed the iron helmet to the general. [Female General] put on the iron helmet and looked into the distance, standing by the stone drum.
0:16:46|0:17:4|On the high platform on the city wall, soldiers raised their crossbows, ready for battle. Female soldiers on the Vermilion Bird Ironworks tightened their belts and marched swiftly towards the front of the Iron Wing. [Pero] saw this scene and asked:
0:17:7|0:17:20|The female soldier walked to the forefront of the Iron Wing, soldiers on the Vermilion Bird Platform threw spears, the female soldier caught the spear thrown by her ally, collectively turned the gun heads and stood upright, pointing straight down to the city. [William] sighed:
0:17:28|0:17:48|Leading the way, [Female General] strides on the iron wings of the Vermilion Bird. Next, two spears fly towards her, which she catches in mid-air with both hands, arms outstretched in a fighting stance. On the city wall, the soldiers look serious, with [Dian Shuai] sitting in the center, looking dignified and staring intently into the distance.
0:17:49|0:18:1|On the city wall, the archers have their giant crossbows ready, with [Zhuque Jun] standing proudly with an iron wing spear in hand.
0:18:3|0:18:12|The city wall is overgrown with wild rocks, resembling a desert. In the reed valley, huge stones stand tall with no grass in sight, and the sound of the wind faintly carries on.
0:18:14|0:18:31|[Pero] couldn't help but ask. At this moment, thousands of exotic beasts were rushing towards the Great Wall. The general remained calm and issued orders, while the drums on the city wall beat loudly, the sound echoing from the towering walls.
0:18:32|0:18:59|Inside the Great Wall, the strongmen are moving giant stones, pouring hot oil on them. When the soldiers' torches approach the stones coated with sesame oil, they instantly turn into fireballs. Pushed by wooden sticks, the fireballs roll down rapidly, and one by one, the trebuchets outside the Great Wall sling them out. The fireballs, like meteors breaking through the sky, dragging long trails of thick smoke, smash towards the ravenous alien beasts.
0:19:0|0:19:17|The fireball landed and immediately exploded, smashing the limbs of the alien beast. The archers on the city wall acted in unison, and a rain of arrows was released. Iron arrows showered the alien beast, and one arrow hit the Taotie in the eye, causing it to fall to the ground.
0:19:22|0:19:42|A ferocious beast climbed up the rocks and roared angrily, then leaped into the forefront of the army to charge. Strange beasts roamed the wilderness, dragging balls of thick smoke, while a rain of crossbow bolts filled the sky, with fireballs streaking across the sky. The ferocious army of beasts charged fearlessly from the canyon.
0:19:44|0:19:50|The main general dared not delay, and immediately ordered Female General to lead the troops with a flying rope in hand and a long spear.
0:19:53|0:20:10|Female General thrusts two spears fiercely into the Taotie's body, soldiers on the city tower stir the ropes, allowing Female General to be pulled back. [William] and Pero watch in shock as two more female soldiers on the ironworks leap down with spears, preventing the Taotie from climbing the Great Wall.
0:20:10|0:20:33|On the iron platform, [Female General] spread her arms, holding a spear and striking down with remarkable grace. She wielded the twin spears to stab at the gluttonous creature. As the spears were dragged back, a female soldier was leaped upon by the creature in mid-air, her abdomen dragged down to the city walls. The creature swiftly tore her apart, limbs scattering in an instant.
0:20:33|0:20:50|In the secret chamber on the city wall, only the waist chains were pulled back, and the soldiers removed their blood-stained waist chains for storage. [William] and [Pero] were deeply impressed by this army, while the foreign old man hid in the corner.
0:20:54|0:21:16|On the battlefield, with smoke and fire everywhere, the endless and voracious army of Taotie beasts is charging wildly through the rocky valley. Among their ranks are a group of strong Copper Winged Taotie, who are folding their copper wings. In the middle stands the fearsome leader of the Taotie, with terrifying fangs, howling to the sky.
0:21:21|0:21:37|[Dian Shuai] gave the order, and soldiers lit the giant meteor hammer with burning oil, simultaneously launching hundreds of fire meteors towards the Beast King. All the gluttons spread their wings to form a protective barrier, [Dian Shuai] observed this.
0:21:37|0:22:1|The protected beast king not only emerged unscathed, but also let out an angry roar, shaking the horns on its head and signaling to all the voracious beasts with its head. The voracious beast army charged towards the Great Wall even more bravely and fearlessly. The layers of voracious beasts at the foot of the city wall surged like waves, and this wave of voracious beasts attacked the dam-like Great Wall.
0:22:2|0:22:23|On the high platform, the shouts pierced the sky filled with flames of war, and the soldiers quickly responded by forming their battle formation, raising their spears. The ferocious enemy army was almost frenzied, unafraid of arrows, already climbing the walls. The first ferocious beast used all four limbs to climb the city wall, viciously opening its blood-stained mouth to bite and devour the soldiers.
0:22:23|0:22:46|The V-shaped formation was broken by his strike, and the soldiers on the city wall were grabbed by the Taotie and thrown off the wall. The soldiers in the air screamed in agony as they were torn apart by the Taotie outside the wall. Everyone deployed in formation charged towards the Taotie, while the young soldier guarding [William] looked anxious, worriedly watching his comrades. [William] saw the foreign old man approaching and shouted loudly.
0:22:50|0:22:58|The young soldier hesitated, but the Taotie on the city wall shook its head and tail, knocking him away. The soldier made up his mind and dropped his shield, charging into battle.
0:23:4|0:23:10|The young soldier exerted all his strength to stab the long spear into the hind leg of the gluttonous beast, but was then sent flying by a sudden turn from the beast.
0:23:12|0:23:32|The Taotie was closing in on the young soldier step by step, using its sharp teeth to pull out the spear on its body, swinging its head and throwing it. [William] jumped high against the wall to catch the spear in mid-air, plunging it into the Taotie's huge mouth. [Pero] held a pointed shield above his head, charging straight at the young soldier.
0:23:33|0:23:43|[William] pulled the little soldier to safety, dodged the attack of the monster, crashed into the crowd, changed direction, and came out again. [William] kicked the little soldier away, the monster missed again, and crashed heavily into the city wall.
0:23:43|0:23:56|The Taotie opens its huge mouth and crawls towards [William], who inserts a spear into the giant mouth, with the other end against the ground. The enraged Taotie pushes [William] along the ground, and in desperation, kicks a long spear.
0:23:56|0:24:19|[William] took the spear and stabbed it into the Taotie, causing it to retreat in pain. Cro continued to pursue, using his shield to push the iron spear even deeper. [William] picked up a crossbow from the ground and turned it into a strong bow. More Taotie climbed up the city wall and charged towards the crowd on the wall. [Pero] rushed over, grabbed a red cloth, and waved it vigorously.
0:24:20|0:24:37|The Taotie was attracted by the moving red cloth. It turned and charged towards the red cloth, behind which was [William] with a bow and arrow ready. The Taotie was shot in the eye by an arrow and fell to the ground. The old man shouted for help as another Taotie was running towards him.
0:24:39|0:24:52|[Pero] saw the old man dodge the fatal pounce of the Taotie. [William] slid under the Taotie and shot an arrow into its eye. The Taotie fell to the ground, blood splattering everywhere.
0:24:53|0:25:11|Outside the city walls, the cannons roar, giant stones and meteor hammers whizzing by. The leader of the Taotie observes the battle, lowering its head to signal with its horns. The Taotie army halts their movements, the brown fur behind them ruffling as they receive the signal to retreat, using their mouths to drag their injured comrades. The army recedes like the tide.
0:25:11|0:25:30|The city walls are filled with the swords of the fallen, as [William] uses his last strength to pick up his dying comrade and throw him off the wall, slowly dragging him away among the scattered rocks. Looking down at the battlefield riddled with wounds, the scattered [Female General]s are either dragging or falling, separated from their companions.
0:25:32|0:25:47|[Dian Shuai] and [Counselor Wang] also led troops to the outskirts of the city to observe. The archers collected their weapons and advanced slowly. The female soldiers on the wings of the Vermilion Bird also gazed intently into the distance. Soldiers on the main road of the city wall pushed carts to clean up the battlefield and tidy up the military formation.
0:25:47|0:26:4|[Pero] wearily followed [William] and asked, "Who are the leading the approaching Imperial Guards?" It was [Dian Shuai] and [Female General], with [Counselor Wang] closely behind. [Dian Shuai] slowly brought the Imperial Guards to a halt, while [Female General] and him gazed steadfastly at the two.
0:26:5|0:26:19|[William] first dropped the hard bow in his hand, and the dejected [Pero] dropped his double swords. [William] gently pushed [Pero]. [Pero] looked at the dagger hidden in the waist of the Imperial Guard Commander and dropped it. The generals and soldiers stared at the two of them.
0:26:34|0:26:48|In the stone chamber, [William] wearily walked down the stairs, the torches on the wall illuminating the room. [William] looked around, frowning suddenly as his gaze was drawn to something. It was his own reflection in a mottled bronze mirror.
0:26:49|0:27:3|Staring at his unkempt reflection in the bronze mirror, [William] suddenly realized he had been on the run for days. A grubby young soldier pushed the door open and entered. It was only then that [William] snapped out of his daze, as the young soldier respectfully saluted.
0:27:4|0:27:19|[William] looked at the young soldier, nodded, wanting to say something, but then remembered the language barrier. He awkwardly raised his hand and clasped his fist, the young soldier smiled in relief. Then he turned and walked away, the sunlight shining down, leaving [William] with mixed feelings in his heart.
0:27:21|0:27:28|The cold night falls on the city walls and the two standing there are [Dian Shuai] and [Female General].
0:27:53|0:28:23|[Dian Shuai] finished speaking and instructed [Female General]. Inside the stone room, [William] suddenly opened his eyes, immediately drew the dagger from his boot, [Pero] pulled out a scimitar and jumped off the bed. It was only then that [William] recognized the foreign old man he had saved during the day.
0:28:36|0:28:42|[William] looked towards [Pero] upon hearing the words.
0:28:50|0:29:12|The old man criticized [William] for his incomprehensible behavior. He glanced disapprovingly and then turned away unsteadily. As the door closed, [Pero] exclaimed excitedly:
0:29:33|0:29:53|[William] nodded in agreement: The sturdy iron gate slowly opened, and two handsome foreigners walked in. It was none other than the transformed [William] duo after their rest and makeover. Following the soldiers' lead, the two entered the military banquet, with [Dian Shuai] standing up and applauding as they slowly entered everyone's sight.
0:29:53|0:30:15|The soldiers and officers stood up and applauded, [William] and [Pero] looked a bit bewildered. They glanced at each other, then walked down the stairs together amidst the warm applause, heading towards the center of the banquet. As the applause subsided, the officers and soldiers took their seats.
0:30:18|0:30:32|[William] nervously pursed his lips and said, "[Pero] teased, as [General Chen], clad in custom armor, approached with [William]'s weapon."
0:30:42|0:30:49|General Chen returned the weapons to him and saluted.
0:30:55|0:31:9|The remark drew laughter from the audience. The generals and soldiers in the hall stood up, clapping and cheering, while the soldiers on both sides moved the tables to make room.
0:31:21|0:31:38|Everyone looked at [William], who spoke softly. [Pero] looked displeased as he quickly walked to the table, picked up a wine bowl, drank it all in one gulp, wiped his mouth with the empty bowl, and walked over. [William] handed the wine flask to [Pero] and said:
0:31:57|0:32:19|[William] attracted everyone's attention by throwing the empty bowl and flipping the iron bowl. [William] shot three arrows in a row with his bow, the first arrow hit accurately, causing the flying bowl to collide with a pillar. The falling bowl was stopped by the second one nailed into the pillar, still teetering on the edge. At a critical moment, the third arrow came with a breaking sound of wind, and together with the second arrow, it caught the falling empty bowl.
0:32:19|0:32:33|The generals were shocked by this incredible archery skill, then collectively stood up and burst into thunderous applause, even [Dian Shuai] cast a look of approval. [William]'s archery won the admiration of the audience, [William] walked over and stuffed the quiver into [William]'s arms.
0:34:15|0:34:27|[Female General] thought for a moment and said, "William seems a bit puzzled." Looking at the food and waiting for [Female General] to explain, she thought for a moment and said.
0:34:40|0:34:49|On the city wall, [William] walks while looking around. Soldiers on the Vermilion Bird Tower are preparing ropes. [Female General] carries a lasso and walks towards [William], gazing at each other from a distance.
0:34:50|0:35:3|[Female General] waved her hand to invite, [William] walked in confidently and climbed up the Vermilion Bird Terrace along the ladder steadily, looking at the scenery on the platform, [William] felt awe in his heart. [Female General] walked to the side with a safety rope, and the three Vermilion Birds all put on waist locks one after another.
0:35:5|0:35:10|[William] snorted disdainfully and looked up, only to realize that he was already dozens of feet high.
0:35:17|0:35:24|[Female General] explained, and the smiles on the faces of the female soldiers brightened even more, causing [Female General] to couldn't help but smile as well.
0:35:38|0:35:57|On the towering Vermilion Bird Tower, thick ropes hang five iron wings. [William] walks around the ropes slowly, followed by [Female General] holding a leash. As they reach the end of the iron wings, [William] slows down, leans over to look down, and sees the battlefield below. [William] then turns around and walks back.
0:36:48|0:37:3|[William] frowned and pondered, he had never experienced such emotions before. It seemed like he had made up his mind to move forward. Deep down, he wasn't actually afraid to take the leap from now on. Looking at the battle scars left behind that day, he finally understood.
0:37:19|0:37:25|General Wu, clad in red armor, is leading a team to inspect the defense works inside the city.
0:37:28|0:37:36|On a table, a small bowl bursts into bright flames, causing [William] and [Balade] to instinctively dodge. [Balade] laughs and says:
0:40:13|0:40:37|A column of imperial guards came rushing forward, led by [Dian Shuai], followed closely by attendants holding torches to announce their arrival. The guards slowed down as they approached the body of a night watchman lying not far ahead. [Dian Shuai] raised his hand to signal the guards to stop steadily. With a look of confusion, [Dian Shuai] asked, then he waved his hand to issue orders, and the guards quietly dismounted.
0:40:38|0:40:49|[Dian Shuai] and [Female General] drew their swords, unfolded the map, and advanced in an orderly manner, quickly forming a formation. Spears interlocked to create a defensive formation, while [Dian Shuai] surveyed the situation through the gaps.
0:40:49|0:41:4|The body of the sentry flowed with a large amount of blood, as [Dian Shuai] led the army forward slowly. Under the moonlight, the Great Wall stood proudly, and a fierce monster, the Taotie, crawled forward with its terrifying fangs exposed a hundred feet ahead of the advancing army.
0:41:8|0:41:21|At the command, the formation stood firm and advanced in unison, resolute and steady. [Dian Shuai] gripped his precious sword, showing anger without intimidation, and he inadvertently noticed the danger behind through the moonlight reflected by the sword.
0:41:21|0:41:30|Another Taotie quietly followed, waiting for an opportunity to strike. [Dian Shuai] signaled to [Female General] to be aware that the Taotie behind them was stealthily approaching.
0:41:31|0:41:51|[Female General] and [Dian Shuai] slowly crouched down, each pulling out the daggers and military spikes from their boots, staying vigilant against the sudden attack of the gluttons. [Dian Shuai] felt a lingering fear in his heart, as a glutton quickly approached the military formation in front. The marching squad on the main road was surrounded by enemies on both sides, with two gluttons charging forward simultaneously.
0:41:51|0:42:5|The Female General had prepared to thrust a short weapon into its eye, but the Taotie was killed just as it leaped into the air from behind. In a moment of urgency, Dian Shuai pushed Female General aside and went straight for the Taotie with his sword, only to have half of his shoulder bitten off.
0:42:5|0:42:32|[Counselor Wang] led the troops over, and the exhausted [Dian Shuai] halted the team. As [Counselor Wang] rushed forward to check the situation, [Dian Shuai] on the stretcher nodded sadly at [Female General].
0:42:32|0:42:41|[Dian Shuai] used his last strength to take out the military token from his waist, slowly handing out the round token with intricate patterns and embedded gemstones.
0:43:4|0:43:10|In the distance, [William] and another person look complicated.
0:43:19|0:43:25|At that moment, the soldiers in the scene all knelt down to receive the orders, and [William] was also touched by this camaraderie.
0:43:26|0:43:32|In the coffin, [Dian Shuai] is dressed in armor with a sword, while [Female General] gently covers him with exquisite silk.
0:43:33|0:43:40|The soldiers and generals, with solemn expressions, slowly pushed the coffin lid closed while wearing white silk on their heads.
0:43:41|0:44:2|On the Great Wall before dawn, the sound of drums pierced the morning sky. Looking at the soldiers stretching for dozens of miles on the wall, all of them wore white silk and white gauze. The warriors lit sky lanterns with torches, and as the sky lanterns floated up, [William] and the others looked in astonishment at the hundreds of sky lanterns rising slowly into the sky.
0:46:36|0:46:44|[Pero] angrily said:
0:46:53|0:47:1|After saying that, [William] pushed open the door and walked in, his face hesitant, on the city wall.
0:47:7|0:47:31|In the thick fog, soldiers lined up to prepare anesthetic. The entire Great Wall was shrouded in dense fog, with iron spears faintly visible, and the distant city walls covered in clouds. The Great Wall resembled a dormant dragon, and in the military ranks, General Lin [Dian Shuai] stood by the wall with a resolute expression.
0:47:31|0:47:49|Female General's infantrymen carried a huge metal horn in front of the wall. The horn had a wide head like a big pot and was over 6 meters long. It took at least three people to lift the mouth of the horn together. It was placed outside the city wall for eavesdropping. Surprisingly, dozens of ladders were set up under the horn.
0:47:51|0:48:11|The young soldier hurried to help upon hearing the words. By the city wall, General Lin [Dian Shuai] turned to look at William [威廉], his expression complex. To avoid General Lin's gaze, William lowered his head and stirred the wheel, the sound of breaking bowls drawing everyone's attention. The young soldier appeared somewhat flustered.
0:48:14|0:48:30|The young soldier's face turned grim as he received his orders and ran off. Nearby, [William] looked around anxiously, realizing that no one was paying attention to him. He then turned and headed towards a corner where weapons were stored. Picking up a quiver and a sturdy bow, he quickly moved away, avoiding the gaze of the other soldiers.
0:48:30|0:48:46|On the city wall, [William] briskly walked past the disciplined Imperial Guards. Soon, [William] encountered a dejected young soldier being sent back. They exchanged a glance, [William] hesitated to speak, then quickened his pace and walked away. Inside the stone chamber, [Balade] anxiously crouched at the door, waiting.
0:49:4|0:49:25|The impatient [Pero] ignored him and walked out of the room quickly. The thick fog on the city wall had not yet dispersed. At the end of the giant horn, [General Chen] was listening attentively, with soldiers in different styles of armor lined up. Some were clad in heavy armor holding long spears, some in soft armor with spiked shields, and there were also female soldiers in leather armor, looking valiant and heroic.
0:49:25|0:49:37|Lined up with crossbowmen and trumpet troops under the wall, wearing capes, carrying quivers, and holding strong bows, all showing that this is an elite army.
0:49:38|0:49:51|The horn soldier in front of the wall was suddenly dragged away by the gluttonous and thrown outside the city wall. The gluttonous army, without artillery hindrance, had quietly reached the foot of the city wall under the cover of thick fog.
0:49:54|0:50:5|Iron hooks are tied to a circular ring, with the other end attached to the soldiers of the suicide squad. As the mechanism is pulled inside the wall, cracks open up on the city wall, revealing giant scissors.
0:50:10|0:50:16|The suicide squad, armed with knives and axes, with bags tied around their waists, leaped outside the city wall under the cover of arrows.
0:50:17|0:50:32|This is a pair of scissors being pushed together with force against the wall, wherever the scissors reach, the monster is torn apart. The suicide squad swings their axes at the monster, the giant scissors open and close, limbs flying everywhere.
0:50:34|0:50:41|On the main road, [William] slowed down his pace and fell into contemplation. The brief experiences of these days had taught him a lot.
0:50:42|0:50:49|Faith, trust, and love for his country emerged in his heart, and he fell into contemplation. On the small path along the city wall,
0:51:6|0:51:18|Balade stood still, Pero turned around to find William. On the city wall and high platform, soldiers stirred the pulleys, pulled the iron chains, and adjusted the crossbows.
0:51:20|0:51:32|Several dozen harpoon swords flew out with iron chains, drawing perfect arcs in the air. They pierced into the body of the glutton with the momentum of breaking through the wind, causing the wounded glutton to howl in pain, one after another. It shook its head in resistance.
0:51:33|0:51:53|The thick iron chains were pulled straight, and the soldiers on the city wall exerted all their strength to hold onto the pulley. Below the city, the ogres tilted their heads and pulled out harpoons with sharp teeth, assisting each other. They bit, dragged, and pulled the harpoon swords out of their companions, causing the soldiers on the city wall to fall one after another.
0:51:53|0:51:59|More and more Taotie break free from their restraints, empty harpoons are thrown onto the city wall.
0:52:3|0:52:13|Inside the city, [William] had a determined look in his eyes, while [Counselor Wang] became anxious. The last harpoon sword wavered, and the soldiers hurried to help. On the city wall, [William] shouldered his weapon and set off.
0:52:13|0:52:28|The iron chains swayed, and the ferocious beast below the city struggled to break free but could not move an inch. [William] tightly gripped his bow and arrow, striding forward quickly against the crowd on both sides. The fearless city defenders on the wall never hesitated and boldly jumped down.
0:52:38|0:52:50|As the iron chains loosened, the monster below the city was able to move, its limbs trembling, the medicine starting to take effect. [William] observed the swinging of the iron chains.
0:52:59|0:53:27|The huge stone-throwing arm suddenly lifted up, and the scorching fireball whistled through the air, piercing the thick fog and smashing into the gluttonous army, creating a sea of fire. In the crowd, the iron chains clanked and banged against the wall, [William] immediately grabbed a large bundle of stones next to him and tied them to himself with a rope.
0:53:34|0:53:50|Lin [Dian Shuai] explained to [William], who nodded and took two steps back. He then leaped from the city wall with arms outstretched, tightly grabbing onto the iron chain connected to the gluttonous beast and sliding down in mid-air.
0:53:53|0:54:9|The archers on the city wall pass the loud arrows to each other, with only the arrowheads of the harpoon arrows left for support. The loud arrows whistle as they are shot out, and the Taotie that are shot emit loud cries as they run, exposing their positions. [William] also manages to safely drop off at the last second before the iron chain is pulled down.
0:54:11|0:54:22|After standing still, [William] did not rush to act, but held his breath and focused on sensing the position of the surrounding gluttons. Only after confirming that there was no danger did he stride forward towards the sedated glutton.
0:54:23|0:54:40|[William] cautiously prodded the Taotie with arrows twice, and when it showed no reaction, he bent down to tightly wrap the iron chain around it. After pulling it taut, he shook the chain to signal the soldiers on the city wall.
0:54:40|0:55:5|The soldiers moved quickly, turning the wheels to pull up the iron chains, dragging the monster outside the city slowly. Just as the sound of arrows was heard, [William] shot an arrow at the monster, causing it to fall to the ground. Unexpectedly, another one rushed out from the side, and in a moment of urgency, a long spear pierced its eye - it turned out to be [Pero] who arrived just in time.
0:55:10|0:55:17|The iron chains on the city wall are still stirring, and the mist is heavy below the wall. Two people each hold a wooden axe, cautiously observing their surroundings.
0:55:24|0:55:34|Two figures twisted and threw flying axes, the two axes collided in the air. With a loud arrow, the monster burst out of the mist, [William] immediately shot three arrows in a row, hitting the eyes one after another.
0:55:34|0:55:45|[Pero] threw the board axe upwards, [William] shot at it continuously with his bow, attracting the Taotie with sound. [Pero] took the opportunity to throw the board axe, splitting it on the head, and then the arrows shot into the Taotie's eyes.
0:55:45|0:56:9|The outer fires are getting stronger, and some monsters have crossed over. [Pero] draws his twin swords, ready to fight to the death, while [William] retreats and picks up arrows, shooting towards the sky. On the city wall, General [Dian Shuai] immediately understands.
0:56:10|0:56:35|Soldiers ran up with a wooden box, which turned out to be filled with weapons made of black gunpowder, including arrows and cannons. The soldiers, in perfect formation, defended [William] and the others as a fiery monster charged towards them. The two of them dodged and lay down to avoid the attack. A Thunderbolt Sword fell at the monster's feet and exploded, shattering its body. The force of the explosion even knocked the two of them over.
0:56:35|0:56:52|William, who was slowly climbing up, had bombs dropping nearby every two steps, causing rocks to fly everywhere. Under the huge impact, the two of them staggered and could barely stand, only able to crawl towards each other. As a ferocious beast attacked through the smoke, it was shot by a Thunderbolt Sword as soon as it leaped up, instantly being blown into pieces.
0:56:53|0:57:1|[William] and [Pero] were also knocked down by the powerful wave of energy. Pero, who was lying on the ground, struggled to get up, leaning on his sword, and moved towards the city wall to open a door.
0:57:2|0:57:14|Delirious [Pero] mistook the chaos in the air for a gluttonous beast swinging a sword wildly, as two columns of soldiers ran out of the stone gate. In the distance, [William] was on the verge of losing consciousness, while the sky continued to roar with artillery fire.
0:57:16|0:57:25|Clusters of mushroom clouds billowed in the sky, as [William] groggily saw [Pero] being rescued in the distance, finally collapsing to the ground, losing consciousness.
0:57:27|0:57:45|In the gentle light, [William] slowly opened his eyes and found someone beside him. He suddenly sat up and realized it was a soldier who had been treating him. Only then did he notice Lin [Dian Shuai] sitting beside him, smiling but not speaking. After confirming it was safe, [William] finally breathed a sigh of relief and said:
0:57:54|0:58:1|Lin [Dian Shuai] looked at [William], who was bare-chested with terrifying scars on his front and back, his expression slightly changing.
0:58:1|0:58:28|[William] absentmindedly rummaged through his clothes, furrowing his brow in thought for a moment. As he straightened his clothes, he nodded in response to Dian Shuai's questioning, saying, [William] gazed at Dian Shuai before turning his attention to the black powder in his fingertips.
0:58:31|0:58:41|[William] nodded and looked at [Dian Shuai] with confusion.
0:58:58|0:59:17|[William] finished speaking and looked towards [Dian Shuai] in the dim light. [Dian Shuai] had a complex expression, nodded in agreement, then stood up and looked at [William] solemnly, saying, "[William] gazed at [Dian Shuai], who did not respond. [Dian Shuai] then turned around and walked away briskly."
0:59:17|0:59:27|[William] looked at the figure in front of him with some confusion. At night, there were flames on the city walls, and the beasts inside the iron cages were roaring. Outside the cages, heavily armed soldiers stood with spears in hand, facing each other.
0:59:27|0:59:49|Counselor Wang, holding a long pole with a magnet attached at one end, slowly approached the iron cage. Inside, the ferocious beast roared and violently slammed against the cage. Counselor Wang stopped, extended the pole with the magnet towards the beast, and it immediately calmed down.
0:59:49|0:59:58|On the side, the censor showed a pleased expression, [Dian Shuai] and the surrounding generals and soldiers were extremely surprised, and the censor applauded and cheered.
1:0:13|1:0:23|On the night city street, soldiers in iron armor marched in formation, while the Imperial Censor sat high on a chair, looking at the iron cage behind him, a smile creeping onto his lips.
1:0:24|1:0:45|The sound of hooves fades away as the convoy disappears into the night. In the stone corridor, [William] stealthily approaches, passing by a room where a young soldier is washing dishes. The soldier looks up at [William], who nods confidently. The soldier looks puzzled, but [William] nods again before striding away.
1:0:45|1:1:0|In front of the wooden door, [William] slowly stopped his steps. He gently pushed the door open and stepped into the room, where his friend [Pero] was sitting. [William] looked at [Pero], who ignored him. [William] casually closed the door.
1:1:0|1:1:20|After glancing at [Pero], he walked into the room. [Pero] coldly said, [William] sat down with a thud, staring at [Pero] and said, [Pero] sneered at this, and [William] felt he had gone too far.
1:2:18|1:2:25|[William] grabbed [Pero] by the chest and forcefully pushed him against the wall, holding a dagger to his throat.
1:2:29|1:2:49|[William] put away his fierce look and set down the dagger, casually sticking it into the table before walking out. A notice came from the Great Wall in the night.
1:3:1|1:3:19|On the city wall, cavalry lined up and galloped, their hooves breaking the calm night. The torches in the hands of the Forbidden Army spread light along the wide Great Wall. Suddenly, the outer city wall was illuminated, as it turned out that a giant fire lamp was dropped by an iron chain, and then soldiers quickly descended from the city wall by pulling on the flying ropes.
1:3:19|1:3:38|A series of shuttlecocks were thrown out, figures flashed by, the vertical outer wall of the city, the Imperial Guards seemed to be walking on flat ground. Further down the steep cliff, there were stone trees and hemp ropes hanging down. The Imperial Guards followed the hemp ropes to the bottom of the cliff, where Counselor Wang held a torch to explore, and inside the stone chamber, Balade opened a gap in the wall.
1:3:38|1:3:56|[Pero] approached the candle and quickly removed it. Inside the cave, hundreds of imperial guards held torches, illuminating the vast cave, which was five to six meters wide and seemingly bottomless.
1:3:57|1:4:3|[William] walked into the stone room, looking around at the empty space, [William] realized that something was amiss.
1:4:4|1:4:21|The gap in the corner of the wall is particularly eye-catching. In the city, two disguised soldiers are secretly observing behind a stone pillar. After the soldiers leave, the two quietly follow, avoiding the small soldiers in the kitchen, sneaking around and hiding, until they reach a large iron gate.
1:4:21|1:4:30|[Balade] put down the burden, took out the black powder that had been prepared long ago from it, untied the rope and hung it on the iron chain. He gently straightened the fuse.
1:4:40|1:4:53|In the stone chamber, the match lit up, the fuse ignited, [Balade] quickly retreated, while [Pero] peeked out from behind the iron roof to look at the iron gate. The fuse was about to burn out but didn't explode, just emitted a few sparks and then went silent.
1:4:57|1:5:35|Behind the bronze tripod, two people stuck their heads out again. Upon hearing this, [Pero] walked forward, while [William] ran towards another passage. The soldier washing dishes in the kitchen stopped, untied his apron, and nervously rushed out, catching up with [William] quickly. He hesitated briefly at the stairs, then hurried off. The entrance was a mess, with [Pero] and the other person sitting on the ground. [Balade] patted [Pero].
1:5:45|1:5:57|Balade casually comforted [Pero] and tossed the sack to him, the two cooperated to fill the gunpowder into the bag. Suddenly, [Pero] stopped and looked towards the door, Balade followed his gaze and saw it was [William].
1:6:50|1:7:5|Balade cut the rope near the wall corner, causing the black gunpowder hanging high to hit [William]. The two of them left with sacks of black gunpowder on their backs, inside the cave.
1:7:41|1:7:57|In the desert, two men and three horses gallop wildly, reaching a hill where they simultaneously pull the reins to look back at Chang'an, the ancient eastern dragon. Just as dawn breaks over Bianjing City, the imperial convoy of fast horses rushes through the Meridian Gate towards the palace.
1:7:59|1:8:11|At a glance, the majestic imperial city with its grand city gates, towering walls, wide roads, and exquisite pagodas, the palace adorned with carved beams and painted rafters, the young emperor curiously walked down from the dragon throne.
1:8:13|1:8:20|On both sides, concubines, civil and military officials slowly approached, covered with iron cages wrapped in linen, emitting bursts of sobbing.
1:8:20|1:8:39|The young emperor walked down the steps, and the [Imperial Guard Commander] pulled aside the cloth, revealing a terrifying appearance that made the officials gasp and step back in fear. The young emperor gave a questioning look to [Officer Shen], who then gestured for the emperor to come forward and take a closer look. Frowning, the young emperor carefully examined the sharp teeth and claws of the terrifying creature.
1:8:59|1:9:8|In the military camp, General Wu shouted angrily, William was dragged in and thrown to the ground, and General Dian Shuai walked over quickly with an unhappy expression.
1:9:9|1:9:17|[William] was tied up with his hands behind his back, sitting on the ground, while [Dian Shuai] rushed over, trembling with anger.
1:10:5|1:10:23|[Dian Shuai] turned to look at [William], unable to help but consider the truth of what [William] had just said. Before the young soldier could speak, he was lifted up by [General Wu].
1:10:25|1:10:30|General Wu angrily pushed away the young soldier and looked towards Dian Shuai, as Dian Shuai made up his mind.
1:10:33|1:10:39|He looked at [William], who met his gaze with a determined expression, while General Lin [Dian Shuai] averted his eyes.
1:10:43|1:10:57|After saying that, he left in big strides. The huge prison gate opened, and [William] was thrown into the cell. [William] sighed unwillingly.
1:10:57|1:11:22|On the desert, [Balade] and [Pero] rode horses carrying black powder. They reached a crossroads, [Pero] looked around, while [Balade] pointed upwards. [Pero] dismounted and climbed up the sandstone. [Balade] watched the figure in the distance, pulled the reins, and ran off with the black powder.
1:11:24|1:11:43|[Pero] was furious. Soldiers on the city wall poured black powder into the bellows, pulled the handle, and slowly launched a crude hot air balloon.
1:11:43|1:12:11|Black smoke billowed along the entire Great Wall, with a fierce wind blowing and inflating every hot air balloon. [William] heard a strange noise and quickly got up to look out the window. A massive hot air balloon crashed, scattering debris in all directions. Another hot air balloon exploded in the sky, causing soldiers to fall from the air. General [Dian Shuai] commanded the troops.
1:12:18|1:12:29|The hot air balloon swayed as it floated towards the distance, with [William] standing on it, overlooking the majestic Great Wall. Fires were blazing, and numerous hot air balloons were falling with thick smoke.
1:12:34|1:12:44|The young soldier at the prison door anxiously unlocks the door, pulls the latch, and opens the cell. [William] walks out slowly from the cell, and the soldier smiles at him.
1:12:45|1:12:52|[William] runs through the crowd on the city wall, and hurries to find [Counselor Wang].
1:13:7|1:13:15|Counselor Wang looks at the hot air balloon flying into the distance.
1:13:33|1:13:55|[Counselor Wang] said helplessly, [William] turned and left after a moment of contemplation, but stopped abruptly after taking a few steps. He looked back at the few scattered hot air balloons floating in the sky, a sudden realization dawned on him - perhaps they were carrying the last hope of the people.
1:14:4|1:14:13|[General] hands over the armor and arrows, [William] takes them with both hands.
1:14:18|1:14:40|[Counselor Wang] consulted with [William], while in the wilderness [Balade] was holding three wild horses. Suddenly, the voices of the Khitan people could be heard approaching. In the blink of an eye, dozens of riders were already in front of them, surrounding [Balade]. In the great hall, the [Imperial Guard Commander] slowly took out a magnet from an iron cage.
1:14:52|1:15:21|[Imperial Censor] slowly retreated with a magnet in hand, marking down nine feet. The fierce beast in the cage suddenly caught sight and flew towards [Imperial Censor] with the iron cage. The beast let go and used the brown fur on its back to convey information. On the wilderness, the beast army was galloping, and the beast king suddenly stopped, raised its horns to send a signal. Thousands of beast army suddenly changed direction and ran eastward.
1:15:22|1:15:44|Leading the way are the Bat Demon and the Beast King, this team advances in a mighty and imposing manner, like a tide surging forward towards Bianliang. The city of prosperity and peace is unaware of the impending disaster, as the Bat Demon struggles in the iron cage on the main hall, the Imperial Censor on the ground throws a magnet that attaches to the cage, finally calming the Bat Demon down.
1:15:44|1:15:58|In the sky, a huge hot air balloon gently drifted over, with [Counselor Wang] tightly holding the direction while the young soldiers struggled to operate the bellows. Looking at the dilapidated town below with flames soaring, [William] couldn't help but furrow his brow.
1:16:7|1:16:36|By the desert campfire, the Khitan people poured gourds filled with gunpowder together. Beside them, [Balade] was gagged and unable to speak, unable to warn of the danger of the gunpowder. The Khitan people tossed the gourds back and forth, until one rolled into the fire. [Balade] panicked as the fuse was quickly ignited, and the explosion startled [Pero] in the distance.
1:16:37|1:17:5|He ran towards the direction of the explosion, as dozens of hot air balloons drifted with the wind over Bianliang. Groups of gluttons ran wildly on the imperial city road, climbing walls, leaping from rooftops to pounce on the hot air balloons. The archers of the Imperial Guard, instead of shooting arrows, attracted the gluttons' attacks. The gluttons leaped up, dragged down the archers, and they died instantly upon hitting the ground.
1:17:5|1:17:17|The Taotie, having tasted the sweetness, became more ferocious and pounced towards the sky. [Dian Shuai] stabbed with his spear to stop the Taotie's attack, but ended up falling to the ground. The soldiers jumped down to assist in the battle.
1:17:25|1:17:35|The female soldier kicked the wall and retreated, then made a move with a spear to kill the glutton, but was carried away by the airborne glutton. [Dian Shuai] pursued, only to be surrounded by more gluttons.
1:17:36|1:18:1|The Taoties slowly tightened the encirclement, [Dian Shuai] holding a spear, slowly retreating, the voice of [William] coming from the hot air balloon. Using the spear as a pole, [Dian Shuai] lifted [William] into the air, ignited the thunderbolt bomb.
1:18:7|1:18:14|[Dian Shuai] took over and threw, shattering five or six Taoties.
1:18:15|1:18:31|[William] took the opportunity to drag [Dian Shuai] onto the hot air balloon. As everyone looked on, the gluttonous beasts formed a circle, feeding the beast king in the center's mouth.
1:18:39|1:18:47|The hot air balloon was torn by the eaves, swaying and falling into the crowd in the rear hall, and the rolling hot air balloon was pierced by a spear.
1:18:53|1:19:10|[Dian Shuai] and others stood up to find themselves surrounded by the [Imperial Guard Commander]. [Dian Shuai] took out the military token, and the hall was already in chaos. Leading the troops through the front hall, [Dian Shuai] proudly arrived in front of the main hall, with palace maids fleeing on both sides of the dragon throne.
1:19:18|1:19:26|The old eunuch walked to the dragon throne and called the young emperor to come out. The young emperor, dressed in a dragon robe and a golden crown, slowly leaned out half of his body, frowning and shouting:
1:19:52|1:19:56|The old eunuch carefully helped the emperor sit back on the dragon throne.
1:20:17|1:20:39|In the desert, [Pero] is playing with the black gunpowder he picked up, with three spirited horses dragging the gunpowder beside him. He sits alone in the desert. Further away, a pair of shadowless imperial guards come galloping towards him. Greedily preoccupied, [Pero] has not yet realized the seriousness of the situation.
1:20:54|1:21:10|The Taotie is covered in black powder bombs, with the Imperial Guard Commander leading the way in the dungeon, William in the lead. The Forbidden Army pushes a cart with the Taotie tightly chained on it, when suddenly a voice comes from above.
1:21:14|1:21:37|[Counselor Wang] signaled to stop, everyone looked up through the sturdy net and saw the Taotie running above their heads. [Dian Shuai] gestured for everyone to keep quiet. The counselor waved his hand for everyone to walk slowly and not to startle it. Everyone walked forward cautiously, finally reaching a doorway and stepping in gently, where it suddenly became bright and spacious.
1:21:39|1:21:51|Inside was a pagoda, with spiral staircases on both sides. Looking up, it was eight or nine stories high. Suddenly, a monster reached through the bars and grabbed the soldiers in the dungeon.
1:21:52|1:21:58|The soldier was hoisted high up, [William] vigorously swung his spear, cutting off the monster's arm. The soldier fell down, and everyone rushed forward to check the situation.
1:22:2|1:22:14|Counselor Wang rushed to the injured young soldier beyond the cart. The young soldier struggled in pain, the blood on his shoulder staining the armor red. William squatted down and gently opened the torn armor.
1:22:21|1:22:40|[Dian Shuai] nodded, and everyone got up and left. Inside the pagoda, two small carts, one tied with a gluttonous beast and the other with pork, slowly came to a stop. The people approached and squatted down to untie the gluttonous beast, while cries could be heard from the dungeon passage.
1:22:41|1:22:52|The crowd picked up their weapons and got ready. The small soldier in the corner slowly climbed up, holding a string of exploding arrows and lighting the fuse. He turned back with a smile.
1:22:53|1:22:56|Just as [William] launched an attack,
1:22:59|1:23:13|A huge explosion sent rocks flying everywhere. As everyone looked on, the passage to the dungeon was completely blocked by the rubble, leaving everyone staring sadly at the pile of stones. Underneath the pile lay the young warrior who would never return.
1:23:13|1:23:32|[Counselor Wang] lifted the latch and slowly opened a crack in the door. Through the crack, the Female General was seen rampaging in four directions. [Dian Shuai] signaled [Counselor Wang] to open the door wide. [Counselor Wang] gently picked up a magnet, held his breath, slowly retreated, and moved around to the side of the crowd.
1:23:32|1:23:56|He exchanged glances with [Dian Shuai] and took two steps back. The three of them stared at the glutton on the cart. It suddenly opened its eyes, moved its body, slowly stood up, turned its head to glare at the three of them, howled, and took a step forward. [William] raised his hand and drew an arrow to guard against any sneak attacks.
1:23:57|1:24:6|[Counselor Wang] holds the magnet, intimidating the gluttonous beast from moving forward.
1:24:9|1:24:19|The Taotie growled and climbed onto the cart, [William] put away his bow and arrow, and everyone watched cautiously as the Taotie sniffed the pork in front of it and took a big bite.
1:24:29|1:24:42|William, Female General, and Pero rushed out of the door, looking around at the trace of the Taotie. In the square, the Beast King was surrounded by thousands of Taotie.
1:24:44|1:25:0|The bat demon acted as a guard, the strong bat demon pinched it up and looked closely before throwing it to the ground. It put away the bat and made way for them to feed the beast king. Suddenly, a demon noticed the three of them, [Counselor Wang] held up a magnet to deter it.
1:25:0|1:25:8|The crowd hurriedly retreated and closed the gate. It was only a matter of time before they were discovered and attacked. The three of them looked up at the top of the tower simultaneously.
1:25:10|1:25:15|The sound of the door being smashed came, [Counselor Wang] quickly walked to the door and raised the magnet.
1:25:17|1:25:33|[Dian Shuai] picked up the grappling hook, grabbed a spear and followed [William]. [Counselor Wang] held a magnet in one hand and a knife in the other, watching as the two went up the stairs. They crossed the magnificent staircase and arrived at the window, opening a gap to look down.
1:25:33|1:25:47|Groups of gluttons feed the Beast King in droves, as [William] draws his exploding sword, pulls back his hard bow, ignites the fuse, and shoots an arrow in succession.
1:25:51|1:26:1|The bat demon spread its wings and shot down the arrows, the explosion startled the beast king who was feeding. The demon looked around for humans and quickly closed the window.
1:26:3|1:26:15|After the two of them finished speaking, they rushed up the stairs. The Beast King looked around the square, trembling its horns and giving orders. Groups of gluttonous creatures attacked two high towers, where [Counselor Wang] stood guard at the door.
1:26:16|1:26:39|The Taoties broke in from above, and [Counselor Wang] knew guarding the gate was meaningless. He threw a magnet upwards, and [Dian Shuai] used his spear to attract the magnet. More and more Taoties broke in through the windows of the pagoda, and [Dian Shuai] tearfully watched the already fallen base of the tower.
1:26:39|1:26:53|[William] no longer hesitated, quickly walked up the stairs, arrived at a window, opened it, and locked onto the position of the bomb-devouring monster. With a determined look, he pulled the bowstring, ignited the fuse, and released the arrow.
1:26:54|1:27:3|The sword whistled past and struck the bomb on the Taotie, only to be deflected once again by the spread wings.
1:27:5|1:27:16|The enraged Beast King looked up and saw [William] on the rooftop, signaling the Taotie to attack. Thousands of Taotie surged towards [William]'s pagoda.
1:27:28|1:27:51|[William] stepped forward and pulled the magnet off the spear, the two of them gathered together to straighten the flying rope, lit the fuse, swung out the pagoda. At this moment, countless demons rushed in and pounced towards the two in the air, the rope drew graceful arcs in the air. More than 10 bloodthirsty mouths flew towards them but didn't harm the two of them at all.
1:27:51|1:28:18|[William] raised the magnet and threw it into the heart of the beast pack, followed closely by spears tied with black powder. The magnet prevented the wings from spreading, the spear pierced the beast king, bit off a piece, and all the bombs detonated simultaneously, overturning the core of the beast pack. [William] and [Dian Shuai] crashed through the window, rolling down from the eaves. In the urgency, [Dian Shuai] grabbed the eaves with one hand and caught [William] in mid-air with the other.
1:28:21|1:28:35|[William] struggled to turn in the air and grabbed onto the eaves with one foot. [Dian Shuai] exerted all his strength to pull him up, with [William] clinging tightly with both arms. With [Dian Shuai]'s assistance, the two of them climbed onto the eaves. However, [William] accidentally stepped on a tile, which fell and hit Balade.
1:28:36|1:28:49|The army of gluttons, stacked up to 10 meters high, collapsed like a mountain landslide. [Dian Shuai] showed a look of relief, signaling the success of the plan to kill the Beast King. As recorded in historical documents, after the Beast King's death, the gluttons remained motionless.
1:28:49|1:29:1|The stiff and tough tao tie at the moment is the best proof. They saved the people and the world in times of crisis, and the Nine Provinces will no longer suffer from their disturbance, allowing the world to be stable.
1:29:4|1:29:20|The warhorses galloped through the yellow sand towards the majestic Great Wall, their hooves kicking up clouds of dust. Leading the way on a tall and imposing horse was [William]. As they approached the prison gate, soldiers unlocked the door, and [William] looked at [Pero] bound in iron chains.
1:29:21|1:29:25|[Pero] slowly looked up and saw [William], he's still alive!
1:29:28|1:29:37|[William] pursed his lips and walked forward, looking at [Pero] with a complex expression, and said with a smile:
1:30:32|1:30:40|[William] smiled and took out a key, walking up to unlock the door for [Pero].
1:30:48|1:31:11|[William] suddenly stopped, it turned out to be Lin [Dian Shuai] walking towards him on the stairs, [Pero] looked around anxiously. Saying that, [Pero] returned to the cell, and conveniently closed the cell door. Lin [Dian Shuai] climbed the steps in armor and arrived in front of [William].
1:31:30|1:31:36|Pero's complaint made the two of them unable to help laughing.
1:31:42|1:31:47|[Dian Shuai] lowered his head and remained silent for a moment.
1:31:49|1:32:17|Lin [Dian Shuai] nodded, and the procession outside the Great Wall moved forward in an orderly manner, the winding path exuding a majestic aura. The march towards the Great Wall was so grand, the procession slowly came to a halt. At the front, [William] and [Pero] looked back at the Great Wall with complex expressions. The former Vermilion Bird Female General had now been promoted to the rank of General of the Cavalry.
