0:1:9|0:1:26|In a wide alley, the sunlight shines brightly on the street. On this beautiful day, the people are busy with their own tasks. At this moment, the camera pans to a blacksmith shop on the side of the street, where two men are continuously hammering on the iron materials on a wooden block.
0:1:30|0:1:45|The fire continued to burn, the smoke coiled like an iron snake in circles, rising higher and higher, gradually drifting away. Under the alternating blows of large and small hammers, the iron was mixed by the fire, emitting a scorching light, causing [Yuchi Gong] to sweat profusely, with large beads of sweat falling from his body.
0:1:46|0:1:56|[Yuchi Gong] continued to put the iron into the fire for forging. Passersby couldn't help but marvel at his blacksmithing skills, as the iron rolled and sparkled under the sharpness, as if it were about to turn into water.
0:1:56|0:2:14|On the anvil, [Yuchi Gong] strikes while the iron is hot, sparks flying with each blow. [Yuchi Gong] wields a large hammer while the old man uses a small one, one big, one small, one strike, one tap, one burn, one clear. The rhythmic sound attracts the attention of passersby, who praise the two for their superb blacksmithing skills and marvel at the complexity of iron smelting techniques.
0:2:15|0:2:30|Under the gaze of the crowd, [Yuchi Gong] raised the gourd of wine high, took a big sip but didn't swallow it. To the anticipation of everyone, he aimed at the spot on the iron rod that had been burned by fire and sprayed the wine out. The iron rod sparked and splattered, causing the crowd to clap and cheer.
0:2:30|0:2:48|The man came to the large wooden tub filled with water next to the anvil, and after cooling the iron in the water, accompanied by the sound of sizzling, steam evaporated from the surface. [Yuchi Gong] showed a satisfied smile. The man took out the iron cooled in the water, which had turned into a exquisite iron whip.
0:2:48|0:2:53|The woman in the house walked out at this moment, calling for the man and [Yuchi Gong].
0:3:19|0:3:34|The wife turned around and walked into the room. The man sat directly opposite [Yuchi Gong], holding a bowl larger than his own face, sighing as he ate noodles.
0:3:44|0:3:51|The man borrowed the baby from his wife's arms, sat down slowly holding the child. The wife played with the baby's little face, the family of three, harmonious and happy.
0:4:21|0:4:23|The child touched the bell hanging on the iron edge of his mother.
0:4:28|0:4:33|The wife held the child upside down, while [Su Yumei] continued to eat from the bowl.
0:4:37|0:4:52|In the afternoon, [Li Shimin] and his father-in-law arrived at the square for the sacrificial ceremony. On the altar, the shaman dripped blood into the wine and drank it all. Then, he raised the iron whip made by Jingde, held it high above his head, and sprayed the blood from his mouth onto the iron whip.
0:4:52|0:4:58|The wizard lightly brushed the iron whip with his index and middle fingers, slowly slid it down, then raised the iron whip high into the sky, reciting an incantation.
0:5:6|0:5:25|The wizard walked with big strides, turned to face the people, and watched as the wizard raised the iron whip in his hands, causing the people to kneel down and kowtow. Yuchi Gong and his father-in-law knelt at the forefront, while the crowd kowtowed and recited spells. Outside the village, thousands of horses galloped, but the people were unaware of the approaching danger.
0:5:25|0:5:30|During the ceremony, Jingde placed the iron whip into the Hall of Heavenly Kings, and his father-in-law said devoutly.
0:5:40|0:5:50|As soon as the words fell, the galloping warhorses raised dust, casting a layer of gray over the village. Thousands of soldiers broke the tranquility of the village, entering with weapons in hand.
0:6:9|0:6:24|The naive deaf-mute boy couldn't hear the arrogant words of the invading soldiers. He was still spinning the spinning top continuously. The soldiers rushed towards the child, and when the child and his mother noticed, the soldiers were only one meter away from him. The child stood still in shock.
0:6:24|0:6:40|Yuchi Gong rode past and grabbed the reins, causing two soldiers to fall off their horses. The spinning top stopped, falling to the side, as the soldiers waved their spears, attempting to blind the child. Su Yumei tightly held onto the spear, restraining the soldier's movements.
0:6:41|0:7:2|The power difference was huge, the soldiers' hands were almost dislocated. Another person stabbed towards [Su Yumei], [Su Yumei] blocked with her left arm, and the spear broke into two and flew into the sky. Immediately, [Su Yumei] forcefully pulled the soldier off the horse. The soldier looked at the spear falling from the sky, fiercely stabbing into his own chest, losing his breath.
0:7:2|0:7:4|The mother quickly took the child to thank and left.
0:7:9|0:7:27|The soldiers panicked and fled, while the villagers alerted [Su Yumei]. In the crowd, [Su Yumei]'s wife held their son in the wall fort, staring in shock with wide eyes. Outside the city, the soldiers rode swiftly to report to the general.
0:7:32|0:7:53|General Yuchi Gong stopped General Lv Huxun's hand, looked fiercely at the soldier he was holding, then mounted his horse and waved his hand to command the soldiers. With a fierce momentum, the general led the troops into the village, determined to seek revenge for Yuchi Jingde. Yuchi Jingde's father paced nervously at home, instructing Jingde on what to do.
0:8:11|0:8:18|Jingde reluctantly watched as a child covered in duck blood rain, while the army riding in to seek revenge showed no hesitation.
0:8:26|0:8:29|The soldiers split up and the father-in-law nervously closed the door.
0:8:49|0:8:58|The wife picked up the scissors beside her, pulled out a strand of her own embroidered hair, and cut it off. With tears in her eyes, she ran to Jingde and handed him the strand of hair.
0:9:3|0:9:22|Wife pushed Jingde out of the back door in distress. Before Jingde could say goodbye to his wife, he saw soldiers searching the yard as soon as he ran in, so he quickly hid behind the eaves. After the two soldiers relaxed their vigilance and rode away, he continued to escape, knowing that Jingde had started his own escape journey.
0:9:22|0:9:41|He ran out of the city gate, with green mountains outside the city. Jingde was fleeing everywhere outside the city, while soldiers were searching for Jingde's family inside the city. In the rugged mountains, Jingde faintly heard the cry of his child. On the other side, in Jingde's home, the general held a knife against the chest of Yuchi Gong, Jingde's father-in-law.
0:10:22|0:10:42|On the small road, [Yuchi Gong] turned around and flew back to the village, while in the house on the other side, [Su Yumei] snatched the child. [Yuchi Gong] strode into the city gate.
0:10:58|0:11:7|At home, Li Shimin's wife pleaded desperately to no avail, crying and falling to the ground, while Yuchi Gong outside on the street, ran to the Temple of the Heavenly King in an instant.
0:11:16|0:11:33|After speaking, [Yuchi Gong] ran out of the Heavenly King's Hall and saw the streets in chaos. He rushed into the blacksmith's shop, only to find his father-in-law lying motionless on the ground. [Yuchi Gong] shook his father-in-law's body vigorously.
0:11:38|0:11:55|[Yuchi Gong] came to the street, and the people fled, leaving only him to face the war brought by thousands of troops alone. The general led the soldiers forward on horseback, smiling triumphantly. He raised his eyebrows and looked at the fierce [Yuchi Gong], as two infantrymen first swung their swords to attack [Yuchi Gong].
0:11:55|0:12:10|[Yuchi Gong] wielded the iron whip with one hand, knocking down two infantrymen. A cavalryman on horseback swung a big knife towards him, but [Yuchi Gong] reacted quickly, using the iron whip to block the attack and then striking the horse's side. The horse startled and turned sideways, as [Yuchi Gong] adjusted his fighting stance.
0:12:10|0:12:28|General's spear stabbed towards [Yuchi Gong], who directly pulled the general off the horse, causing him to fall heavily to the ground. The spear swung towards [Yuchi Gong]. As he resisted with an iron whip held vertically in both hands, he noticed a blazing fire pit to his side and rear. He spun the iron whip to pick up charcoal fire, and sparks splattered on the general's face.
0:12:28|0:12:43|General, with no way out, shot a hidden weapon at [Yuchi Gong] in an attempt to escape. The weapon pierced into [Yuchi Gong]'s left arm, as other soldiers rushed forward with long spears. [Yuchi Gong] alone grabbed hold of four spears, rendering the soldiers unable to move.
0:13:18|0:13:42|Struggling to break free from the soldiers' siege, [Yuchi Gong] limped after his wife, who was being taken away, while she cried out. With red eyes, [Yuchi Gong] looked at his wife in pain, waking up from a nightmare, sitting up abruptly and taking deep breaths to calm himself down.
0:13:52|0:14:6|After the soldier left, [Yuchi Gong] slowly raised his hand in the room, rubbed his knee, and then grabbed his neck. The suffocating pain felt so real, as if he had just experienced a true memory replay instead of a dream.
0:14:6|0:14:16|After a moment of calm, [Yuchi Gong] took out a carefully wrapped handkerchief from his clothes, opened it cautiously, revealing a lock of hair cut by his wife inside.
0:14:17|0:14:24|Yuchi Gong's hair was tied up with fine ropes and adorned with jade pendants, showing how much he treasures the things left by his wife, [Su Yumei].
0:14:33|0:14:49|In the midst of reminiscing, there was a mysterious masked figure outside the window, surreptitiously observing the interior. One day, as the morning sun rose, the light still carried the lingering essence of the night. A mysterious man dressed as an official released a carrier pigeon, sending the intelligence he had seen the previous night elsewhere.
0:14:50|0:15:0|At the gate of Jiezhou, [Yuchi Gong] led the soldiers to overlook the people, understand the situation, and gaze into the distance from the gate. The soldiers following [Yuchi Gong] expressed their concerns to him.
0:15:2|0:15:26|Looking along the direction guided by the soldiers, chaos could be seen on the street, with war fires burning and thick smoke rising. The streets were deserted, with people struggling to survive. Men with injured legs moved with difficulty, while women ran with children. A man turned over stones in Lianggang, smashing an empty jar without saying a word.
0:15:42|0:15:51|The soldier [Li Shimin] bowed and took his leave, complex emotions surging in his heart. He turned to look into the distance, where the signboard of Jiezhou City was clearly visible.
0:16:19|0:16:38|[Li Shimin] did not answer, the hand holding the horse tightened slightly, sitting on the horse, staying in place, frowning and looking ahead, thinking. In a moment, the artillery continued to attack Jiezhou, with firearms being shot from a distance, attacking the gates of Jiezhou. It turned out that the Tang army had pressed forward in force, with thousands of foreign troops invading the city of Jiezhou.
0:16:39|0:16:53|The Tang army was well-organized, well-equipped, carrying numerous weapons. A group of soldiers pushed the war chariot towards the city gate fiercely, trying to break it open. The Tang army waved their military flags, looking like victory was within their grasp, the soldiers shouted loudly, confident of their imminent success.
0:16:54|0:17:12|On the carriage door, [Yuchi Gong] commanded the troops to shoot arrows at the Tang army below the city tower. Tang soldiers climbed up the city wall with long ladders, while the defending soldiers shook the ladders and dropped heavy objects. Many Tang soldiers were hit hard and fell down. The Tang army increased their efforts to break through the city wall, while [Yuchi Gong] called on the soldiers to defend rigorously.
0:17:15|0:17:34|The Tang army threw weapons and took advantage of the unpreparedness of [Yuchi Gong]'s army. Many Tang soldiers rushed up the city tower, and the two armies met in battle. The soldiers guarding the city gate were still shaking the ladder and throwing stones to resist the Tang soldiers climbing up the tower. Seeing this scene, [Yuchi Gong] bent his knees, pulled the bow, and shot towards [Li Shimin] riding a horse below the city, the sharp sword piercing through the Tang army flag.
0:17:34|0:17:47|The arrow struck the man's chest directly, but he didn't struggle and fell to the ground. [Yuchi Gong] felt strange but couldn't understand why. The real [Li Shimin] stood outside the city, watching the battle from afar on the distant mountainside.
0:17:52|0:18:10|Under the leadership of [Yuchi Gong], the soldiers pushed down the last ladder for the Tang army to climb up. The Tang soldiers fled in panic, while [Li Shimin], who was watching the battle from afar, rode away. [Yuchi Gong] and his soldiers cheered and celebrated on the city wall, marking the successful defense of the city. The defeated Tang army fled from the city gates in successive waves.
0:18:10|0:18:20|[Yuchi Gong] looks into the distance from the city gate, while [Li Shimin] analyzes the topography of Jiezhou with stones outside the city. The city walls of Jiezhou are six zhang high, surrounded by mountains on three sides.
0:18:36|0:18:59|[Li Shimin] discovered a secret, his face relaxed with a hint of joy, but soon replaced by deep contemplation. He walked a few steps forward with a pole, the wind blowing his helmet, strengthening his determination. He walked to the tree where General [Cheng Yaojin] was resting, only to find [Cheng Yaojin] sleeping soundly, shaking his head helplessly.
0:19:11|0:19:27|[Li Shimin] immediately ran to his horse. [Cheng Yaojin] fought against Jingde, who threw [Cheng Yaojin] to the ground, injuring his hand. Meanwhile, Jingde was already chasing after [Li Shimin].
0:19:32|0:19:46|[Yuchi Gong] surged forward, with [Li Shimin] in the lead and [Cheng Yaojin] riding behind the two. Alert and urgent, the three of them were not far apart, galloping together like a straight line extending to the horizon along the vast desert and river.
0:19:46|0:20:4|When crossing the river, [Li Shimin] and [Yuchi Gong] easily rode their horses through the water, while [Cheng Yaojin], being larger in stature, lost his balance and fell off his horse into the water. The awkward appearance of [Cheng Yaojin], due to the intense chase, added a touch of threatening humor to the atmosphere.
0:20:18|0:20:37|When [Cheng Yaojin] stood up to chase the horse, the hill had already been occupied by the Tang army. On the small hill, Qin Shubao shot arrows towards [Yuchi Gong]. With quick eyes and hands, Jingde grabbed the sword from the side and [Li Shimin] had already ridden far away. Jingde dismounted to confront Qin Shubao.
0:20:41|0:20:58|Qin Shubao threw the bow and arrow to the soldier behind him to catch, then dismounted and drew the double-sided attack weapon from his back to attack Jingde. Jingde defended with an iron whip, while Qin Shubao kept pressing on and attacking Jingde. Jingde dodged by flipping backwards, the two of them were evenly matched, and after several rounds of confrontation, it was hard to determine the winner.
0:20:59|0:21:28|From afar, [Li Shimin] called for a small group of reinforcements to come. Qin Shubao held the iron whip of Jingde from both sides, and the two brave and skilled generals sized each other up. Just as the two were deadlocked, [Li Shimin] appeared with his troops. The two put down their weapons and separated. [Li Shimin] dismounted, walked to face Jingde and Qin Shubao, and spoke.
0:22:8|0:22:29|Not far away, a burly mysterious man lurked beside a big tree, silently observing everything. He respectfully bid farewell with clasped hands to [Li Shimin]. However, no one noticed the sneaky mysterious man hiding in the woods nearby. Watching Yuchi Gong ride away by the jade pool, [Li Shimin] solemnly declared to Qin Shubao.
0:22:36|0:22:50|After Yuchi Gong returned to the military camp, he celebrated with his military advisor, who was all smiles. They raised their glasses and drank heartily. The military advisor then set down his glass and asked Yuchi Gong.
0:23:8|0:23:35|Jingde stood up, walked to the military map behind the military advisor, and stood in front of it, finding Binzhou on the map. He turned to the military advisor with a worried expression and asked. Yuchi Gong looked at Binzhou on the map with some doubt, while the military advisor looked at Jingde with a sly smile. Jingde spoke as he walked.
0:24:19|0:24:29|The military advisor was frightened, hesitated for a moment in shock. Jingde saw the advisor's stunned reaction and couldn't help but laugh out loud, prompting the advisor to quickly respond to Jingde.
0:24:59|0:25:19|Speak up, using the arrows in his hand to intimidate [Yuchi Gong], the military advisor kept retreating. In the next moment, [Su Yumei] shot a green arrow from his hand, the arrow flew past the left side of the military advisor's face, scaring him into closing his eyes. [Su Yumei] left the tent, and the military advisor cautiously opened his eyes, only to see the arrow sticking straight into the emblem of Binzhou City. In the evening, the military advisor and his men plotted in secret.
0:25:35|0:25:46|The man underlings is the one who was peeping in the woods before. After the strategist left, the man stared at Jingde's room for surveillance. The next day, Cheng Yaojin pulled the bow and aimed at the pigeons flying in the sky.
0:25:52|0:26:2|With one strike hitting the target, Cheng Yaojin ran to where the prey fell and picked up a carrier pigeon, unexpectedly finding a piece of paper tied to its foot. He untied the paper and handed the intelligence over to [Li Shimin].
0:26:24|0:26:30|In the military camp, [Li Shimin] showed a confident smile of imminent victory, then retreated to the throne and gave orders.
0:26:47|0:26:53|The military advisor of Prince Jin, Yuchi Gong, stood on the city gate with the Sui soldiers, watching the Tang army retreat, and said to the Sui soldiers.
0:27:33|0:27:49|The strategist squinted his eyes, turned around with a dark expression, and left, the two of them leaving the city gate. As night fell, [Su Yumei] rested in the room, the lingering sound in the courtyard adding to [Su Yumei]'s worries and anxieties. [Su Yumei] pushed open the door to change her mood, sighed with her head down.
0:27:49|0:28:0|In the sky, the bright moon hangs high, half of the moon is shrouded in darkness. The moon is half bright and half dark, just like the state of [Su Yumei]'s heart. [Su Yumei] misses his wife and children, worrying about their safety.
0:28:1|0:28:20|Looking up at the moon, [Yuchi Gong] had already teared up, in the half moonlight, he seemed to see his wife and children. [Su Yumei] was thinking that her family might have been imprisoned by the enemy, waiting for her to rescue them all.
0:28:30|0:28:35|The hazy crescent moon added a touch of melancholy to [Su Yumei] as she thought of this.
0:28:35|0:28:52|He, with red eyes, slowly lowered his head, blaming himself inwardly, looking at the strand of embroidered hair tied in his hand, playing with the jade pendant and bells tied to the rope. The softness in his heart was touched, settling his longing for his wife and children. However, the sudden intrusion of the corpse breaking into the room shattered the rare bottleneck in [Yuchi Gong]'s heart.
0:29:7|0:29:19|[Su Yumei] rode away from Jiezhou city alone in the dead of night, heading towards Bingzhou with a look of worry on her face. The darkness added an eerie atmosphere to the forest. [Yuchi Gong] rode his horse to the outskirts and found a carriage overturned in the woods.
0:29:28|0:29:46|The man held an iron chain and suddenly tightened it around the neck of Yuchi Gong. Yuchi Gong's voice caught the attention of the soldiers napping next to the carriage. The soldiers rushed over and tightened Yuchi Gong's neck from behind. Yuchi Gong shook off the two men and fell to the ground. But more soldiers emerged and fell on top of him, pressing him down.
0:29:46|0:29:53|The soldiers dragged Yuchi Gong back by the iron chain around his neck, and together they tied Yuchi Gong to a tree with his hands bound behind his back.
0:29:54|0:30:6|Jingde couldn't break free, holding tightly onto the iron chain around his neck to prevent suffocation. The military advisor walked over with a sinister smile.
0:30:43|0:30:48|Yuchi Gong exerted all his strength, trying to break free from the iron chains. A soldier approached with a sword, then shot out a sharp blade.
0:30:51|0:31:17|Originally, a [Cheng Yaojin] suddenly appeared on the scene, shooting down the soldier with a returning blade arrow. [Cheng Yaojin] brought a group of men and horses, frightening the group of [Yuchi Gong]. [Yuchi Gong] set up traps all around, his men were all defeated, the Tang soldiers fought bravely, searching for [Yuchi Gong]'s whereabouts.
0:31:17|0:31:46|In the carriage, [Yuchi Gong] was discovered by [Cheng Yaojin]. [Cheng Yaojin] knocked down two party soldiers and blocked the way to the carriage. Just then, Tuo Tiechain Jinde approached, he threw down the iron chain and grabbed [Yuchi Gong]'s throat, pressing [Yuchi Gong] against the tree.
0:31:55|0:32:7|[Yuchi Gong] was fatally stabbed by a sword. It turned out to be [Su Yumei] who supported the falling [Yuchi Gong].
0:32:13|0:32:20|The military advisor has already died, falling heavily to the ground. [Yuchi Gong] walks slowly in despair and tears, as [Cheng Yaojin] shouts.
0:32:29|0:32:35|[Yuchi Gong] hesitated, looking pained, and asked [Cheng Yaojin], who smiled and walked over.
0:32:56|0:32:59|[Li Shimin] hurriedly arrived on horseback. Yu Chi Jingde looked up in confusion and said with a pleasant tone.
0:33:40|0:33:53|Li Shimin bowed his head and turned to leave. Yuchi Gong dismounted and followed Li Shimin. Li Shimin walked to Yuchi Gong's side and asked as he turned.
0:34:23|0:34:33|[Li Shimin] had anticipated this question and confidently walked up behind [Yuchi Gong], answering. [Yuchi Gong] respectfully knelt before [Li Shimin].
0:35:2|0:35:11|The two of them were extremely worried, [Yuchi Gong] looked anxiously towards Jiezhou, and the next day led the Tang army to march out to rescue the city of Jiezhou.
0:35:13|0:35:16|Become the right-hand man of [Li Shimin].
0:35:23|0:35:32|Wherever Fan Jingde's army went, they were invincible in battle, sweeping away all obstacles in the way of the Tang army. Fan Jingde fought on the battlefield for [Li Shimin], achieving great victories and renowned military exploits.
0:35:49|0:36:0|Outside the grand Tang palace, with a majestic presence and heavy military guards, everything is thriving and full of vitality. Inside the forbidden city, the people live and work in peace and prosperity, with flourishing commerce and transportation.
0:36:8|0:36:27|In the market inside the city, vendors are shouting, selling novelty items everywhere, women are dressed beautifully, living happily. In the outskirts of the city, in the woods, [Li Shimin] and Yuchi Gong lead the troops on horseback, hunting and playing. The group is looking for prey, stops the horses, and a soldier reminds [Li Shimin].
0:36:32|0:36:50|A group of people rode after, and the bear chicken was foraging under the tree. The group led by [Li Shimin] approached quietly. [Li Shimin] and [Yuchi Gong] slowly took aim in a shooting posture, afraid of startling the bear chicken. After aiming, [Li Shimin] quickly shot an arrow. The arrow pierced the body of the bear chicken, and everyone rejoiced.
0:37:42|0:38:2|[Li Shimin] agreed and left on his horse. Watching the figure of Jingde disappear into the distance, [Li Shimin] sighed heavily. Before long, Jingde arrived at the riverbank with his horse, surrounded by tall trees and short grass, with the west wind blowing and clear water under a sunny sky. Walking slowly along the riverbank, one man and one horse. Not far away, [Li Shimin] and his party galloped through the woods, searching for prey.
0:38:6|0:38:26|Upon seeing the prey in front of him, [Li Shimin] felt excited, he drew the arrow from his back, aimed at a wild rabbit grazing not far away. Unlike the intense chase with Lin Jian, by the riverside, it felt like being in a paradise, an old horse lowered its head to drink water, and he had to wait by the horse for a long time before the battle. Meanwhile, Lin Jian was still nervously hunting.
0:38:30|0:38:47|[Li Shimin] raised his hand to signal everyone to move on, carefully observing the rabbit's tracks. After leading the rabbit away, he led the troops to chase after it, while Jingde and the old horse remained by the river. The old horse drank its fill of water, raised its body, and saw Jingde slowly scoop up some water with one hand, using its nose to nudge Jingde's cheek gently.
0:38:47|0:38:57|Yuchi Gong deeply misses his wife and children, the ripples in front of him seem to reflect their faces. The horse leans against Yuchi Gong, as if comforting him, and Yuchi Gong reaches out to stroke the horse.
0:38:59|0:39:4|[Li Shimin] and his companions followed the rabbit into the depths of the forest, but their vision was blocked by thick fog.
0:39:15|0:39:31|The mist lingered, the cold wind blew, and the slanting wind that disturbed the leaves made the mountains and forests extremely eerie. The soldiers all gripped their sword hilts, on edge. [Li Shimin] and his group only heard the sound of footsteps and horse hooves carried by the cold wind, but could not see who was approaching.
0:39:31|0:39:39|A group of strong men dressed in nomadic attire stand behind the bushes, with bows hidden next to the trees, arrows on the strings, ready to be released.
0:39:49|0:40:5|The two armies confront each other, with [Li Shimin] riding away on horseback. However, the enemy soldiers, armed with bows and arrows, prove too much for the Tang army's swords. An enemy soldier shoots [Li Shimin] in the back, and another soldier helps him escape on horseback.
0:40:8|0:40:24|A thick fog enveloped the area as the enemy troops galloped in pursuit, their imposing presence catching the attention of [Li Shimin] not far away. Just in time, Jingde rushed to rescue Li Shimin, standing in the way of the enemy troops with his sword drawn. A soldier from the enemy side swung his blade towards Jingde, who blocked the attack with his own sword and then swiftly kicked another soldier, causing him to fall to the ground.
0:40:25|0:40:44|Yuchi Gong pursued the enemy and dismounted two soldiers, throwing them heavily to the ground. A petite soldier on horseback attacked with a quick knife, but Yuchi easily took the knife from him. As the soldier spun and landed on the ground, her long hair caught everyone's attention - she turned out to be a beautiful woman, who stared arrogantly at Yuchi.
0:40:44|0:40:50|Yuchi Gong inserted the sword taken from Jinde into the ground, frightening the enemy soldiers to the ground and unable to get up, when a soldier on a fast horse came to report.
0:40:58|0:41:2|[Li Shimin] stayed in place, but the enemy's large army had already arrived.
0:41:21|0:41:41|Turkish soldiers entered the border, burning, killing, and looting, committing all kinds of atrocities. In the village, the flames of war were raging, with the sound of weapons clashing. The brave soldiers of the Tang Dynasty fought against the Turkish soldiers, sacrificing themselves for their country. The battle was fierce and intense, with drums of war thundering. The Tang army, like a pack of wolves and tigers, was unstoppable, achieving victory in every battle. They fought with their backs against the water.
0:41:41|0:41:50|Placed in a desperate situation, the frontline soldiers of the Tang Dynasty navigate through the shadows of swords and spears, thrilling and galloping on the battlefield, crushing the Turkic army.
0:42:12|0:42:15|As the butcher raised his knife, he said to the Turkic beauty who was fighting against Yuchi Gong,
0:42:34|0:42:38|The Turkic princess knelt down defiantly, and just as Yuchi Gong raised his sword, something unexpected happened.
0:42:40|0:42:53|Yuchi Gong rode a fast horse and arrived at the hill, angrily staring at the soldiers who were about to slaughter the prisoners of war after parking the Han snow horse. He glanced at the Turkic princess and called a halt to the [Butcher].
0:43:24|0:43:45|Prince Qi arrived and stopped the two confronting individuals. The two knelt down and greeted Prince Qi. Prince Qi, fully armed and majestic, rode his horse around the two, examining Su Yumei. After a while, he interviewed Su Yumei with a displeased tone and spoke.
0:43:59|0:44:3|The prisoners of war have now laid down their weapons.
0:44:21|0:44:32|Prince Qi watched Jin De intently. Then, the Turkic princess was hung horizontally on a tree, with five long ropes placed beneath her. If she fell, her life would be in danger. Prince Qi said, "..."
0:44:43|0:44:47|The Turkic princess glared at the cunning [Li Shimin], while [Yuchi Gong] bowed and said.
0:44:51|0:45:11|Li Shimin's words had just fallen, and the soldier standing next to Yuchi Gong immediately attacked him with a beast. Yuchi Gong first caught the long weapons in the hands of the two soldiers with both hands, kicked with his feet, and the two fell to the ground. Then he used the two weapons he had taken to resist the attacks of others, swinging the weapons to raise the yellow sand. The other soldiers were no match for Yuchi Gong at all, and all fell to the ground and could not get up.
0:45:12|0:45:26|As the incense stick is about to burn out, [Li Shimin] is helpless and dismounts himself. In a moment of urgency, he fiercely stabs towards [Yuchi Gong], but [Yuchi Gong] grabs his wrist. [Yuchi Gong], unarmed, leaves [Li Shimin], who is holding a weapon, too shocked to make a move.
0:45:26|0:45:33|In the end, [Li Shimin] dropped the Changshuo in his hand along with the burning incense, and [Yuchi Gong] kicked the pine rope to save the princess.
0:45:37|0:45:52|The soldiers surrounded the Qin king to protect him. The rescued princess looked at Jingde with admiration and respect in her eyes. The Qin king, with anger burning in his eyes, glared at [Yuchi Gong] with a terrifying look full of hatred, brewing revenge and blood feud.
0:45:52|0:46:4|At night, everyone returned to the Tang army camp. In [Yuchi Gong]'s tent, the princess was taking a bath in a wooden tub, slowly pouring water over herself. Just then, [Yuchi Gong] happened to return to the camp.
0:46:19|0:46:35|The princess slowly stood up with the help of a wooden bucket, water droplets sliding down her body. Before she could wipe them off, she draped herself in a soft silk robe. Then, she turned sideways, lightly stepping out of the wooden bucket and walked down the steps with interest.
0:46:54|0:47:10|Yuchi Gong, in a nervous state, quickly released Su Yumei's embrace, ran out of the tent, leaving Su Yumei standing there desolately, watching Yuchi Gong's departing figure with a sense of loss. Outside the tent, Li Shimin rode back to the camp on horseback, welcomed by the Prince.
0:47:56|0:48:2|[Li Shimin] stopped and the crown prince looked at Jingde with great interest, Jingde said.
0:48:19|0:48:36|Speak up. Jingde pulled out a sword from the waist of Prince Qi, after five swords, he unbuttoned his shirt, revealing a long scar on his back. Li Shimin was so shocked that he couldn't speak, while Jingde still had scars of varying depths on his chest and arms. Seeing Crown Prince Leng Heng, Li Shimin spoke up.
0:48:43|0:48:48|[Li Shimin] and the soldiers knelt down one after another to beg for mercy for Jingde, which greatly offended the Crown Prince and his king, leading to a final decree.
0:49:4|0:49:7|Li Shimin bid farewell to Jingde in the mountains as the sun set in the west.
0:49:36|0:49:52|Yuchi Gong knelt down solemnly in front of [Li Shimin], causing a cloud of dust to rise as his knees touched the ground. Then, with great respect, Yuchi Gong kowtowed to [Li Shimin]. Li Shimin, unable to contain his emotions, touched Yuchi Gong's hands and helped him up.
0:49:52|0:50:4|The two of them looked at each other with reluctance, tears already welling up in their eyes. Yuchi Gong's eyes were full of gratitude, grateful for the mercy shown in the midst of war, grateful for the monarch's discerning grace.
0:50:5|0:50:24|Li Shimin's eyes were filled with guilt, more so with reluctance. Guilty for not allowing the general to enjoy the treatment he deserved, reluctant to see the pillar he had nurtured about to leave him and wander the world. Even the usually carefree Cheng Yaojin couldn't bear to watch such a sad scene, turning around and walking away with his head down.
0:50:24|0:50:32|Jingde, upon seeing the situation, quietly led the black horse and left. Jingde brought back the sweat-blooded precious horse that had accompanied him in battles for many years to his hometown.
0:50:54|0:51:0|This is the place where he forged weapons, and also the starting point of his battlefield conquest.
0:51:37|0:51:41|The Heavenly King's eyes looked puzzled and thin, as if he could see through the affairs of the world.
0:51:58|0:52:12|Yuchi Gong then stood up and respectfully placed the iron whip on the offering rack. Leaving the Heavenly King's Hall and walking towards home, Jingde witnessed the bitterness of the world, with streets covered in sand and dust. An old man carrying a burden on his shoulders, pouring out the sorrow of life.
0:52:13|0:52:34|Jingde returned to the dilapidated blacksmith shop, where the merciless dust seemed capable of blowing it down. He looked at the crooked signboard and the floor covered with accumulated soot, the blacksmith shop was already a pile of ruins, devoid of vitality. Tears welled up in Jingde's eyes, but in the blink of an eye, it seemed as if his wife was still there, smiling sweetly at him after preparing a meal.
0:52:34|0:52:49|In his eyes, his wife was calling the family to dinner, and Jingde was about to go up to her. But when he took another look, the person in front of him had disappeared, and the blacksmith shop had returned to its current dilapidated state. He reached out to grab his wife, but he couldn't touch her, no matter how hard he tried.
0:52:49|0:53:3|Jingde lowered his head and saw broken bowls and dishes all over the ground, a mess that was unbearable to look at. Under the chaotic stack of hay, he picked up a familiar fragment and examined it carefully, it was the large bowl his wife used to serve him meals years ago.
0:53:4|0:53:21|Memories flooded back, the bowl that once held steaming hot meals now lay shattered on the ground, cold and broken. [Yuchi Gong] tried to suppress his sadness, picked up the pieces and slowly walked into the room. But as he pushed open the door, all that greeted [Yuchi Gong] was the merciless dust.
0:53:22|0:53:42|The room was filled with dust, as if shrouded in shadow. [Yuchi Gong] walked slowly, suddenly tripping over something on the ground. Under the thatch, [Yuchi Gong] saw a buried pair of scissors. He bent down, pushed aside the straw, carefully picked up the fallen scissors from the ground, and gently brushed off the dust clinging to them.
0:53:57|0:54:10|At this point, tears of [Yuchi Gong] couldn't be stopped anymore, he broke down in tears holding the scissors full of memories. The mighty seven-foot-tall warrior, the undefeated General [Yuchi Gong], now broke down in memories.
0:54:18|0:54:31|Time has not diminished the sorrow in [Yuchi Gong]'s heart, and his longing for his wife and children has only grown stronger over the past twenty years. No one knows how [Yuchi Gong] has spent these two decades, and no one knows the inner vulnerability of this invincible hero.
0:54:32|0:54:51|In the distance, within the territory of the Turks, a young warrior hangs upside down on one leg beside a horse, while two Turk soldiers with long spears confront him. With a swing of his sword, the soldiers are unable to defend themselves. The young warrior gallops on the horse and shoots arrows, hitting the bullseye accurately. At the same time, the two arrows he shoots hit the centers of two different targets.
0:54:51|0:55:9|The Khan who was watching the competition and the soldiers cheered, but the young warrior, Yuchi Gong, was clearly not satisfied with such archery and applause. He continued to ride forward, already ten meters away from the target. As the spectators were puzzled, the young warrior bent down and shot an arrow backwards, hitting the bullseye directly from behind the target.
0:55:29|0:55:42|The young warrior Le Ma shouted. [Li Shimin] stood on the city wall, watching the back of the young warrior leading the troops leaving, and asked the military adviser beside him.
0:55:52|0:56:0|Both of them remained silent, [Li Shimin] looked down at the city with concern, quietly contemplating, his eyes gazing into the distance.
0:56:20|0:56:29|[Li Shimin] looked apologetic and guilty. Lowering his head in thought for a moment, [Li Shimin] spoke.
0:56:31|0:56:37|[Li Shimin] and [Cheng Yaojin] arrived at Jingde's hometown, where the village had regained its former vitality. [Li Shimin] sighed.
0:56:59|0:57:9|In the blacksmith shop, an apprentice saw someone approaching from afar and ran inside to report to Jingde. After the apprentice came out, he continued to tend the fire. Yuchi Gong walked closer and asked with a smile.
0:57:17|0:57:39|[Cheng Yaojin] and [Li Shimin] followed the apprentice into the house to find Jingde. The apprentice led the two to the backyard. [Cheng Yaojin] was hit with mud on his face and fell to the ground.
0:58:19|0:58:48|[Li Shimin] asked, with [Cheng Yaojin] covered in mud, angrily speaking. [Li Shimin] stood up in sorrow and anger, the two looked at each other, and in disappointment, they left. Jingde looked at the goose in silence, staying in place with a silly smile, while the apprentice followed behind the two muttering.
0:58:52|0:59:2|[Li Shimin] followed [Cheng Yaojin], but [Cheng Yaojin] stopped and walked towards Jingde's stable. The apprentice followed in surprise, staring at [Cheng Yaojin]. [Cheng Yaojin] looked at the horse and sighed.
0:59:37|0:59:52|[Li Shimin] gave the apprentice a silver ingot and left. The apprentice held the silver and looked guiltily at the two figures walking away. [Li Shimin] and [Cheng Yaojin] walked their horses on the street, with [Li Shimin] sighing repeatedly in a dejected manner, expressing his feelings.
1:0:8|1:0:18|[Cheng Yaojin] suddenly turned around, took the wine gourd hanging on his horse, and ran towards the Jingde family. [Li Shimin] was a bit puzzled. After a while, [Cheng Yaojin] arrived at the backyard of the Jingde family with the wine in hand, shouting.
1:0:42|1:1:8|Jingde arranged the seeds in a pattern, [Cheng Yaojin] filled two bowls with wine. Cheng Yaojin drank one bowl in one gulp, and [Yuchi Gong] also drank heavily. Cheng Yaojin took the opportunity to snatch the handkerchief from inside [Yuchi Gong]'s clothes, and Yuchi Gong stood up to take it back. Cheng Yaojin laughed heartily until Yuchi Gong spoke.
1:1:36|1:1:39|[Li Shimin] helps up [Yuchi Gong].
1:1:57|1:2:13|[Yuchi Gong], who was questioned by Cheng Yaojin, stood still, tears in his eyes, trembling corners of his mouth expressing the bitterness and unwillingness that [Yuchi Gong] couldn't put into words. With red eyes, [Yuchi Gong] looked ahead and then proceeded to the Hall of the Heavenly King, opened the door, and placed the iron whip at the offering place for the Heavenly King.
1:2:13|1:2:17|[Yuchi Gong] respectfully looked at the Heavenly King, and said earnestly.
1:2:33|1:2:51|[Yuchi Gong] picked up the iron whip, raising a cloud of dust. [Yuchi Gong] looked at the weapon that had accompanied him in battles with some excitement. The statue of the Heavenly King looked down from above, as if its eyes could see everything. [Li Shimin] and Cheng Yaojin also arrived at the Heavenly King's temple to observe the situation in Jingde. After making all the necessary arrangements, the three of them returned to Bailiang Pass to lead the troops into battle.
1:2:51|1:2:55|The unpredictable wind and rain, outside Bailiang Pass, a great battle is about to begin.
1:2:56|1:3:7|Tang soldiers and Turkic soldiers are fighting under the towering mountains and steep ridges, with war drums thundering, military flags fluttering, and smoke filling the air, obscuring the sun, the sound of drums echoing powerfully.
1:3:21|1:3:24|Jingde looked at Baolin, feeling both surprised and very familiar.
1:3:33|1:3:52|Yuchi Gong and Su Yumei faced each other, with a look of anger and determination in Su Yumei's eyes. Li Shimin tightened the reins, while Su Yumei gripped the iron whip in his hand. Almost simultaneously, Li Shimin and Su Yumei charged towards each other on horseback, the duel began. With a swing of their weapons, both of them fell off their horses and rolled to the ground.
1:3:52|1:4:5|With weapons in hand, [Yuchi Gong] and [Su Yumei] struggled to stand up. [Yuchi Gong] was shocked as he stared at the bell pendant hanging on [Su Yumei]'s iron whip. After adjusting her stance, [Su Yumei] attacked [Yuchi Gong] with the iron whip.
1:4:6|1:4:21|[Su Yumei] has tremendous strength and lightning-fast moves, forcing [Yuchi Gong] to step back repeatedly. [Yuchi Gong] struggles to block [Su Yumei]'s iron whip, and he looks at the whip in her hand and asks.
1:4:21|1:4:30|[Yuchi Gong] took the opportunity to knock the bell off the iron whip of [Su Yumei], caught the bell and carefully rang it. Shocked, [Yuchi Gong] asked [Su Yumei].
1:4:34|1:4:50|[Su Yumei] angrily attacks [Yuchi Gong], who holds an iron whip and restrains [Su Yumei]. In the struggle, they push each other away with force. [Yuchi Gong] then lifts up the iron whip and examines it carefully, only to remember that his son's name is engraved on it.
1:4:56|1:5:16|[Yuchi Gong] joyfully knelt on the ground, [Su Yumei] regained her energy and stood up, holding the iron whip to strike at [Yuchi Gong], who lost consciousness in joy. Baoling swung the iron whip at Jingde, who closed his eyes to welcome his son's attack. After hitting Jingde, Baoling stood stunned in disbelief.
1:5:16|1:5:23|Blood flowed down Jingde's left arm, Baoling felt extremely puzzled, slowly put down her hand, the Turkic soldier with an arrow in his mouth shouted.
1:5:26|1:5:46|The Turkic soldiers surged forward, with [Li Shimin] leading the Tang army to meet them. Soldiers charged forward one by one, wielding their swords and spears, fighting bravely and shedding blood on the battlefield. Life seemed so insignificant on the battlefield, as the soldiers shouted slogans with great sorrow. In the intense and chaotic battle between the two armies, Jingde still knelt in place, while Bolin stood opposite him.
1:5:46|1:5:56|Cheng Yaojin, holding an axe, charges towards Baolin. Baolin counters with an iron whip, knocking Cheng Yaojin off his horse, stepping on him, and raising the iron whip to threaten him.
1:6:4|1:6:12|The Tang soldiers were defeated and fled in panic, with the thrilling scenes lingering in their minds. They hurriedly retreated back to the inside of Bailiang Pass, where the Turkic army achieved a great victory.
1:6:13|1:6:39|Baoling, who had achieved a great victory, did not feel the unprecedented satisfaction. She lay on the rocks outside the city, looking at the vast sky. The iron whip stood in front of her, witnessing the tragic separation between Baoling and her mother. Many years ago, her mother held a baby to escape from a group of soldiers.
1:6:43|1:6:53|The mother exchanged Baoling for tree branches on the ground, while Baoling hid in the bushes with an iron whip. The mother ran to the edge of the cliff, with no way to escape.
1:6:57|1:7:18|As a young child, Baoling cowered in silence, while her mother, looking at the cliff behind her, was forced to retreat step by step. Holding back tears, she leaped into the cliff, leaving her mother disfigured from the fall, with only branches wrapped in the fortress wall. Baoling thus saved her own life. The thought of this caused Baoling immense heartache, making her unable to lift her head.
1:7:18|1:7:21|[Yuchi Gong] also cherishes the past memories.
1:7:45|1:7:54|[Yuchi Gong] was filled with mixed emotions as he hung the bell he had taken on the iron edge. In the past, his wife's gentle call as she hung the bell on the iron edge to protect their family.
1:8:2|1:8:8|[Yuchi Gong] focused on hanging the bell on the iron edge, quiet and unaware of the unusual surroundings.
1:8:9|1:8:28|In the distance, an arrow suddenly shot out and pierced into a nearby tree trunk. Jingde examined the arrow, then looked in the direction it came from, but did not see the archer. He pulled the arrow out of the tree trunk and found a piece of paper tied to it, with calligraphy written on it in scrolls.
1:8:55|1:9:10|Speak, Jingde bid farewell to [Li Shimin] on horseback and ventured into the woods alone. [Li Shimin] and the soldiers watched Jingde's back with some concern, but Jingde did not look back, riding into the depths of the forest alone to rescue Cheng Yaojin.
1:9:10|1:9:23|Upon entering the forest, a layer of mist filled the air. Yuchi Gong cautiously looked around, seeing no one in sight, he still remained vigilant. Suddenly, Su Yumei rode out on a horse from a pile of grass, wielding an iron whip as she charged towards Yuchi Gong.
1:9:27|1:9:30|Baolin is on horseback, looking down at him and saying.
1:9:53|1:9:59|[Baoling] dismounted and stood on the ground, looking directly at Jingde, then rushed forward the next second.
1:9:59|1:10:18|Jingde raised his left hand and resisted with his right hand. While the two were in close combat, not far away on the cliff, a group of soldiers ambushed by the Turkic Khan. The two were completely unaware. Jingde asked [Baoling] during the confrontation, and [Baoling] pushed Jingde away and said angrily.
1:10:24|1:10:27|[Baoling] was instantly enraged, Jingde was knocked aside.
1:10:51|1:11:11|During the argument between the father and son, Cheng Yaojin was hanging on a tree shouting out challenges. The Tang army led by [Li Shimin] performed with drums beating and horns blaring. [Li Shimin] drew his sword to boost morale, and the soldiers raised their arms high and shouted, launching an attack on the Turkic army. Turkic soldiers rushed forward to meet the battle, and the two armies fought fiercely, evenly matched in strength.
1:11:11|1:11:20|It's thrilling to watch. In the woods, [Cheng Yaojin] hanging on a tree watches as [Jingde] and [Baoling] fight below, still shouting for a turn.
1:11:25|1:11:34|Turkish soldiers were already ambushed and positioned on the distant mountains, aiming their bows. At the foot of the mountain, [Yuchi Gong] restrained [Li Shimin]'s weapon on a tree trunk.
1:11:46|1:11:50|The weapon left a crack on the tree trunk, [Bao Lin] pushed [Jing De] onto the tree.
1:11:58|1:12:14|[Near Virtue] shouted, [Protect Lin] swung an iron whip towards [Near Virtue]'s head. The scene then cuts back to the battlefield where the two armies are fighting. [Li Shimin] is surrounded by several Turkic cavalry soldiers. In the chaos of battle, fallen soldiers are pushed heavily onto the Tang army's war drum, then collapse on the ground.
1:12:17|1:12:31|[Li Shimin] is still fighting against the Turkic army, while in the depths of the forest, [Su Yumei]'s hand holding the whip stops at the most tense moment. The Turkic Khan on the mountain sees the actions of the two clearly. [Su Yumei] turns around and looks up at the sky.
1:13:1|1:13:19|[Su Yumei] slowly stopped the horse, standing between the Khan and Jingde father and son. She glared down at the Turkic soldiers, raising her whip. Pointing at the soldiers, she finally stared at the Khan. Swinging her whip to attack the soldiers, the Khan shot [Su Yumei] with a hidden weapon.
1:13:27|1:13:30|Bao Ling knelt on the side, with [Su Yumei] looking pained.
1:13:33|1:13:51|[Su Yumei] had blood dripping from the corner of her mouth, she looked at Jingde with pain and affection. [Su Yumei] struggled to raise her hand slowly, trying to hold Jingde's hand, but could only touch it lightly, unable to grasp it. In the end, she exhausted all her strength, blood sliding down from the corner of her mouth, and closed her eyes in agony.
1:13:55|1:14:11|Bao Ling pulled out the small hidden weapon from [Su Yumei], carefully examining the sharp hidden weapon resembling a small comb, and suddenly realized. She glared at the Turkic Khan, whose expression was sinister and eerie. Bao Ling stood up, raised the hidden weapon, and confronted the Khan.
1:14:23|1:14:40|After Baolin exposed the truth, [Yuchi Gong] smirked cunningly and spoke slowly. The Turkic warrior [Khan] brandished his sword and charged towards Baolin, who also rushed at him with a whip, managing to break the arrow stuck in his chest and assist Baolin.
1:14:42|1:15:5|The Turkic soldier fled, and the father and son forced the Khan to the large tree that had been split before. The Khan's knife was stuck in the tree, and [Su Yumei] squatted down, holding an iron whip to bind him to the tree trunk. The sword of Baolin struck, heavily hitting the Khan's chest, like chopping wood, one side after another. The tree trunk had already split, and the Khan's back seemed to have also split.
1:15:5|1:15:8|With Baolin's final blow, he fell to the ground along with the tree trunk.
1:15:20|1:15:30|[Khan] spits out blood and is killed by Baolin. Baolin and [Su Yumei] finally resolve their differences, their eyes filled with deep affection as they gaze at each other earnestly.
1:15:46|1:16:1|The two of them looked at Cheng Yaojin hanging on the tree together. Baoling couldn't help but laugh and went forward to rescue Cheng Yaojin. As night fell, the father and son who ended the great battle returned to [Su Yumei]'s home together, their iron whips placed on the shelf, showing great warmth.
1:16:2|1:16:22|Jingde sat by the window, with [Su Yumei] sitting behind him. [Su Yumei] carefully applied medicine to the wound on Jingde's shoulder. Jingde looked straight ahead with a firm gaze, his calm face revealing no inner turmoil. Jingde quietly savored the rare moment of peace and reunion between father and son.
1:16:22|1:16:30|[Su Yumei] put down the ointment plate and looked uncomfortably at the wound on her father's body. The bond between father and daughter is stronger than blood, and [Su Yumei] finally spoke up,
1:16:39|1:16:48|The first time when [Su Yumei] called herself "dad", a complex mix of joy and emotion surged in Jingde's heart.
1:16:48|1:17:5|After carefully applying the ointment, [Su Yumei] gently helped her father put on his robe. Jingde tightly held the handkerchief close to him, looking solemnly at it, his thoughts drifting back to the past, reminiscing about his deceased wife. Seeing his father so absorbed, [Su Yumei] sat upright next to him with a serious expression.
1:17:6|1:17:21|Watching her father treasure the handkerchief in his hand, [Su Yumei] was full of curiosity and confusion. After a long silence, he slowly spoke to [Su Yumei].
1:17:27|1:17:41|Quietly, Yuchi Gong reached out and handed the handkerchief to Su Yumei. Su Yumei stared at the handkerchief and took it carefully. She observed it attentively, afraid of damaging whatever was inside. She examined it closely, hesitating to unfold the handkerchief.
1:17:41|1:17:53|At this moment, quietly leaving, leaving Bao Ling alone, giving her a separate space, and Bao Ling slowly unfolding the handkerchief layer by layer. Absorbed in it, she did not notice her father's departure, and slowly opened the handkerchief.
1:17:54|1:18:12|The handkerchief contained a strand of mother's hair. Yuchi Gong, this strand of hair was cherished by father, tied with a rope and a bell, carefully wrapped in the handkerchief, carried close to the body. Baoling finally understood that father had always been concerned about the two of them.
1:18:13|1:18:33|Thinking of this, looking at her mother's belongings, Baoling was already in tears, crying silently. Tears wet Baoling's cheeks, and she gently wiped the tears with this handkerchief. The night was deep, the people were quiet, only a few names were left. Jingde was alone in the room reading bamboo slips, and a few suspicious figures lurked on the eaves in black clothes.
1:18:33|1:18:39|A group of black-clad individuals with masked faces, unable to see their identities, exerted force to hook onto the nearby tree branches.
1:18:40|1:19:1|Killing time, a few dark shadows flash by, leaping off the roof, entering the Jingde courtyard, walking quickly towards Jingde's room. Jingde senses something unusual outside the room, closes the letter, and the masked men arrive at the door of Jingde's room, one on the left and one on the right. Inside the room, Jingde quietly lifts the iron whip on the shelf and walks towards the door. Outside the room, the masked men also raise their big knives.
1:19:1|1:19:15|Quietly approaching Jingde, a corner inside the house, a step outside the house, tense and exciting. Jingde suddenly opens the door, but there is no one outside. The next day, with the sky already bright, [Li Shimin] enters Xuanwu Gate alone.
1:19:15|1:19:30|At first glance, the Xuanwu Gate appeared empty, leaving [Li Shimin] puzzled. In the blink of an eye, the gate was closed with archers covering the city tower, revealing a well-prepared ambush to greet [Li Shimin], led by the Crown Prince and the Prince of Qi.
1:19:33|1:19:42|King Qin [Li Shimin] and the conflicts between Crown Prince Li Jiancheng and Prince Li Yuanji finally erupted.
1:19:50|1:19:53|A fierce battle unfolds at Xuanwu Gate between [Yuchi Gong] and [Su Yumei].
1:19:59|1:20:12|This is the famous Xuanwu Gate Incident in history. Yuchi Gong walked out of the Xuanwu Gate carrying the head of the Crown Prince Li Jiancheng, leaving Li Shimin feeling anxious and conflicted.
1:20:12|1:20:21|[Jingde] raised the prince's head above his own head, showing it to the soldiers of the Tang Dynasty. The soldiers surrounding [Li Shimin] were strong and dared not show any disrespect to him.
1:20:40|1:20:58|Just as the war came to an end, after [Li Shimin] charged forward, everything settled down in the dust. But on a normal night, as [Li Shimin] had already gone to bed, a cold wind blew, causing the curtains by [Li Shimin]'s bed to flutter continuously. The candlelight in the room went out, and the dimness made it look eerie and terrifying.
1:20:58|1:21:5|Two men in white robes with long hair slowly descend from the air to the bedside of [Li Shimin], approaching him while shouting.
1:21:34|1:21:53|[Li Shimin] woke up, his forehead covered in large beads of sweat. It turned out that in [Li Shimin]'s dream, the spirits of the Crown Prince and the Prince of Qi appeared suddenly, trying to strangle him to death. The scene in the dream was so vivid, but the faces of the Crown Prince and the Prince of Qi were so terrifying that [Li Shimin] felt a real sense of helplessness and fear.
1:21:53|1:22:0|He gasped heavily, finally waking up from his dream, while outside the house the birds were chirping loudly.
1:22:31|1:22:42|Cheng Yaojin bid farewell to [Li Shimin], with the setting sun in the west. The next night, Cheng Yaojin prayed towards [Li Shimin]'s bed.
1:22:52|1:22:57|Cheng Yaojin retires, Jingde and Shubao look at each other, while Duan is guarding [Li Shimin] outside the door.
1:22:58|1:23:14|Jingde carried a big knife, while Shubao held a long spear. The two of them tightly gripped their weapons, showing no signs of slackening throughout the entire night. The quiet night slowly passed by under their watch, and as the sun gradually rose, daylight replaced the darkness.
1:23:14|1:23:28|The next morning, [Li Shimin] pushed open the door, feeling refreshed and energetic, sweeping away the fatigue of the past. Cheng Yaojin, Jingde, and Qin Shubao stood guard outside the door, with Cheng Yaojin anxiously asking.
1:23:34|1:23:38|[Li Shimin] stretched and said with a sigh of relief and satisfaction.
1:24:21|1:24:40|[Li Shimin] listened and approved of Cheng Yaojin's strategy, feeling extremely delighted. The portraits of Yuchi Jingde and Qin Shubao were lifelike and were pasted outside [Li Shimin]'s palace gate to guard the peace. From then on, the portraits of Yuchi Gong and Qin Qiong became the door gods of China and were passed down among the people.
