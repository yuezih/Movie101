0:1:49|0:1:54|[Zhu Guangsheng] looked at the grilled meat in his hand, then he placed the skewer on the plate.
0:2:39|0:2:45|Defeated, [Zhu Guangsheng] placed his clenched fist on the table and immediately stood up.
0:2:52|0:3:1|The other two at the table watched as Zhu Guangsheng's eyes followed the man who had just left, and Zhu Guangsheng was called back.
0:3:31|0:3:57|The fat man shook off [Zhu Guangsheng]'s hand. [Zhu Guangsheng] shouted at their backs in response. Speechless, he looked at the little dog in his arms with a heart full of pity. The just rescued little dog had a pair of big watery eyes, looking innocent. He nodded and continued speaking. Then he walked home with the little dog. However, after a short walk, he placed the little dog on the side of the road.
0:3:57|0:4:1|He felt very pleased watching the lively little dog in front of him.
0:4:4|0:4:31|The clueless puppy sat still watching him swing the scarf around his neck. Then he made a dramatic gesture towards the puppy, took a few quick steps forward, and [Zhu Guangsheng]'s figure gradually moved away. The puppy then got up and walked towards him. The screen gradually darkened, and the title "Bloodhound" emerged in the middle, accompanied by the mournful howls of two evil wolves.
0:5:4|0:5:25|The highly vigilant snow wolf looked back at everything around it, the sky full of white clouds flowing rapidly in its eyes. Suddenly, under the snow-covered ground, a pair of eyes covered in frost slowly opened under a black hat. He stared closely at the snow wolf not far away, and finally the snow on the branches fell down, and the flat ground sank.
0:5:25|0:5:30|The snow wolf, Zhu Guangsheng, heard the movement and let out a low growl, but the hunting rifle in the dark had already aimed at him.
0:5:31|0:5:44|The long-planned gunshot finally rang out, and the snow wolf at this moment also fell in a pool of blood. On the other side, the forest ranger [Zhu Guangsheng], who rushed to the sound, was galloping towards the deep mountains, followed closely by hunting dogs to help him find the right direction.
0:5:44|0:6:3|At the same time, a group of people emerged from the snow, ignoring the snow on their bodies, their eyes fixed on the fallen snow wolf not far away. [Zhang Biao], holding a hunting rifle with a forest ranger badge on his arm, then took out a woven bag they carried with them and approached the snow wolf, putting it inside.
0:6:3|0:6:13|Zhu Guangsheng then arrived at the forest police station in the Sardabank Grand Canyon. Sitting on a horse, he pulled down the scarf wrapped around his mouth, looked around, as if searching for something.
0:6:14|0:6:35|In the deep mountains, hunters carrying snow wolf woven bags walked towards the forest, unaware that three snow wolves standing on the mountainside were staring at them fiercely. Soon they reached the snow wolf's den, and upon seeing the wolf cubs, the lead man immediately caught one out. The captured wolf cub looked at the hunters and kept making a mournful and plaintive cry.
0:6:39|0:6:49|The injured wolf cub caught by the hunter was thrown towards the tree trunk and fell to the ground, and he pulled out another wolf cub from the hole. At this moment, a hunting gun was aimed at the two of them, and [Zhang Biao] holding the gun said,
0:7:20|0:7:29|The irritable [Director Liu] became cautious instantly after hearing [Zhu Guangsheng]'s words. Subsequently, [Director Liu] quickly gathered the police officers to head to the Wild Wolf Valley. Due to his exceptional familiarity with the terrain,
0:7:35|0:7:53|The four fleeing individuals ran in different directions, as the arriving police officers got out of the car and raised their guns to chase after them. [Zhu Guangsheng], who got out of the car later, called his beloved dog to join the pursuit. The thick snow on the ground hindered the police's chase, but the fearless officers followed the footprints left by the hunters and pressed on.
0:7:55|0:8:8|At this moment, [Zhu Guangsheng]'s beloved dog Mengzi came to the rescue. Brave and fierce, it swiftly pounced towards [Zhang Biao], biting onto his arm. No matter how hard [Zhang Biao] tried to shake it off, he couldn't escape its grip. Director Liu then forcefully removed [Zhang Biao]'s mask.
0:8:13|0:8:33|The police pushed the handcuffed [Zhang Biao], who suddenly looked up at [Zhu Guangsheng] standing beside him with resentment in his eyes. The simple [Zhu Guangsheng] frowned and stared back at him. Then, the Director Liu behind them pushed and urged him to move on quickly. But after taking a few steps, he turned back and warned [Zhu Guangsheng] with his eyes. At that moment, the honest [Zhu Guangsheng] finally realized and started to worry.
0:8:33|0:8:45|The dim sky was filled with large snowflakes falling gently, as if hiding the massacre within the white snow. The snow wolf that had narrowly escaped quietly kept all of this in its heart.
0:8:45|0:9:4|The next day, the sun shone down on the earth. In the forest ranger station of Sarda Ban Canyon, sheep were gathered in piles, standing on the mountainside that had not yet melted, bleating. Accompanied by the barking of the dogs locked in the dog pen. Then, [Zhou Lao] carried a shoulder pole and walked towards the dog pen, while [Mengzi] excitedly ran ahead.
0:9:6|0:9:15|Patiently, [Zhu Guangsheng] opened the cage one by one to feed the wolves, and the wolves, attracted by the food, immediately stopped barking. Then [Zhu Guangsheng] took [Mengzi] to the training ground.
0:9:18|0:9:23|Mengzi leaped up, swiftly passed through the obstacle equipment, and the car on the mountain road broadcasted a sound.
0:9:35|0:9:57|[Zhu Guangsheng] was driving and talking on the phone. Trying hard to see the road ahead, he firmly replied. With only his car on the mountain road at this moment, he quickly hit the brakes, turned the car around, and urgently headed home. He drove with hazard lights flashing all the way, speeding through the pitch-black road. Before long, he appeared at the dog kennel, holding a flashlight and walking towards the innermost part.
0:9:57|0:10:3|In sight are a mother dog and several puppies lying in a doghouse.
0:10:9|0:10:21|After expressing his love for dogs, [Zhu Guangsheng] took off his coat and covered the mother dog, who had just given birth, as she continued to lick the puppies to clean them.
0:10:21|0:10:37|Returning home, [Zhu Guangsheng] first put on a military coat with a forest ranger badge. Then he looked at the neatly stacked quilt on the bed, glanced at the table beside it, and finally placed the pillow aside, picked up the quilt with one arm. Suddenly, he noticed a jar on the cabinet.
0:10:37|0:10:46|He picked up the can and carefully read the instructions, then put it down. After a few steps, he turned back, picked up the can, and walked outside.
0:10:47|0:11:8|Not long after, [Zhu Guangsheng]'s wife returned to the house in the snowstorm. Standing at the door, she stomped to get rid of the blood seeping into her shoes. While brushing off the snow on her body, she looked inside the house. Then she walked towards the messy dining table holding two cabbages. She first put down her shoulder bag, then placed the cabbages on the table. Still not fully recovered, she rubbed her hands together while looking around.
0:11:8|0:11:19|In the dog kennel, the mother dog finally gave birth to the last puppy with the help of [Zhu Guangsheng]. It immediately bit through the amniotic sac covering the puppy and helped clean it, while [Zhu Guangsheng] held onto its tail.
0:11:20|0:11:46|After finishing speaking, the old buddy turned and walked away, leaving [Zhu Guangsheng] alone leaning on the fence, quietly watching the mother dog and her puppies. At this moment, he felt extremely happy inside. The mother dog then picked up the puppies that were placed on [Zhu Guangsheng]'s back one by one and started nursing them. [Zhu Guangsheng] picked up the last puppy born and placed it next to the mother dog, letting her continue to clean the puppies. Contentedly, [Zhu Guangsheng] sat in the dog's nest and unconsciously started humming a song.
0:11:46|0:12:3|He lovingly stroked the mother dog's head, unable to express his feelings in words. His old buddy looked at the recovering mother dog, then raised his head and smiled at [Zhu Guangsheng], handing over the prepared milk powder. Carefully, [Zhu Guangsheng] took the bowl and placed it in front of the mother dog, allowing her to drink freely.
0:12:4|0:12:23|Later, when [Zhu Guangsheng] returned home, he saw his wife, who was picking dates, suddenly become cautious. He turned around, walked to the mirror, took off his hat, shook off the snow on his body, then bent down to wash his hands. After drying them, he walked to the stove, picked up the lid and looked inside. Not finding any food, he opened another lid beside it.
0:12:23|0:12:42|To his surprise, there was still no food in the pot. He looked at his wife in astonishment, then took out a small knife he carried with him and cut down the cured meat hanging in the corner. Sitting in front of the cutting board, he put away the knife and ate the meat heartily. After gnawing on a piece of meat, [Zhu Guangsheng] nervously shifted his feet.
0:12:43|0:12:49|The two of them stood back to back, talking. [Zhu Guangsheng] turned his head with a forced calmness and said,
0:12:50|0:13:8|Zhu Guangsheng's wife, who was picking at the big red dates, pursed her lips, suppressing her anger. Zhu Guangsheng, who was gnawing on the meat, began to look uneasy. He chewed on the meat, staring blankly at the remaining piece in his hand. Seeing him not responding for a long time, his wife, lost in thought, he realized at this moment that he had made a mistake.
0:13:12|0:13:18|His wife, angry, continued to tightly grip the hand placed in the winnowing basket, but he still did not respond.
0:13:22|0:13:35|His wife threw the dustpan along with the jujubes at him, and he dropped the meat and picked up his hat to leave. As Zhu Guangsheng walked out of the door, his wife picked up the dustpan from the ground and threw it heavily at his back again.
0:13:56|0:14:16|Zhu Guangsheng and Zhang Biao sat on either side of the bed, panting heavily. After the eldest daughter finished speaking and left, the helpless younger daughter picked up the knife at the end of the bed and also walked out. At that moment, a frame appeared in the scene, containing two family photos and pictures of the young couple. They used to be so green, but the past time will never return.
0:14:16|0:14:28|The next day at the bustling market, the second daughter [Zhu Lin] stood at the cotton candy stall, waiting for her own cotton candy. After she finished eating the cotton candy to her satisfaction, she went to the stall selling bags and asked the boss to pack it for her.
0:14:28|0:14:54|Shortly after, she walked alone towards the market in the scene, and soon appeared next to the pile of dirt where she was tidying up her clothes. A small dog squatting nearby lifted its innocent head to look at [Zhu Lin]. It softly whimpered when it saw [Zhu Lin] walking away and followed closely behind. [Zhu Lin] immediately stopped to prevent it from following, but after a few steps, it caught up again. After repeating this a few times, it finally lay on the ground, exposing its belly, and acted coquettishly towards [Zhu Lin].
0:15:2|0:15:10|[Zhu Lin] walked to [Zhu Cong]'s side, leaning against her. [Zhu Cong] and [Zhu Lin] turned to look.
0:15:28|0:15:35|Reluctant Changzi, after patting his head, satisfactorily takes a bite of the grilled skewer and returns to the room where Zhu Cong is practicing dance moves.
0:15:54|0:16:19|[Zhu Cong] turned around and leaned on the bed railing, delivering a kick from behind. When her eyes glanced at [Zhu Lin]'s school bag, the guilty [Zhu Lin] immediately hugged the bag to his chest. Curious, [Zhu Cong] walked up and opened [Zhu Lin]'s bag. A little dog inside poked its head out and looked around. On the other side, [Zhu Guangsheng] herded the sheep into the pen with a sickle on his shoulder. Then he slowly walked down the hill and placed the sickle in front of the house.
0:16:19|0:16:49|[Zhu Lin], standing close to the wall with a puppy in his arms, turned around upon hearing a noise. [Zhu Guangsheng] smiled and glanced at [Zhu Lin], then quickly turned to look at the sickle. After realizing what was happening, he immediately turned his head to the puppy in [Zhu Lin]'s arms. He couldn't help but walk towards it, pointing at the puppy and asking [Zhu Lin]. Excitedly, [Zhu Guangsheng] stared at the puppy, continuously petting its head. After speaking, he stood up straight and looked in the direction behind him.
0:16:50|0:16:52|He then turned to [Zhu Lin] and said,
0:16:54|0:17:4|He leaned close to [Zhu Lin]'s ear and whispered softly. The two like-minded individuals exchanged a smile, then [Zhu Guangsheng] turned and left, leaving [Zhu Lin] alone playing with the puppy.
0:17:16|0:17:31|Following the mother's lead, [Zhu Lin] reluctantly walked towards the door and followed her out. With one foot propped on the bed railing doing a split, [Zhu Cong] smiled smugly, while the innocent little dog was placed on a pile of snow-covered weeds.
0:17:31|0:17:39|The next morning, as soon as it was light, [Zhu Lin] opened the door to look for the dog. Just as he was feeling disappointed, the dog walked over from the corner of the wall.
0:17:46|0:18:3|She excitedly held the puppy tightly in her arms. At noon, under the bright sunshine, Old Zhu stood in front of the adobe oven, scooping the freshly baked bread into a basin with a shovel. His wife sat in the garden washing clothes. Suddenly, the sound of a tractor caught his wife's attention. A man got off the tractor.
0:18:18|0:18:24|A man stood on one foot on the adobe kiln, then squatted down beside it.
0:19:19|0:19:28|Old Zhu looked at [Zhu Lin] with affection on his face, his wife hung up the clothes and walked towards them, glaring at Old Zhu with her eyes, then she picked up the basin filled with bread and left.
0:19:32|0:19:37|The man turned away tactfully, while Old Zhu caressed the little dog in his daughter's arms and said,
0:19:58|0:20:16|On the hillside, a man holds a bow and arrow. Zhu Guangsheng puts down his shovel and walks towards him. He takes the bow and arrow from the man, who steps back. The man places the sword on the string, adjusts his stance by holding the end of the sword with two fingers, pulls back with force, and the arrow hits the wooden stake in front accurately.
0:20:18|0:20:42|After handing the bow to the man, he looked at the surprised man who hit the stake, [Zhu Lin] holding a puppy admiringly looked at his father. Later, in the training ground formed by the wooden stakes, Old Zhu was directing the apprentices, while [Zhu Lin] sitting aside holding the puppy, pursed his lips watching them. After Old Zhu finished training, he guided the young puppy to walk on the arched equipment.
0:20:58|0:21:13|Time flies, Blue Wave has grown into a well-trained wolf dog, with strong and powerful limbs, running as fast as lightning. Following Old Zhu's command, it swiftly passed through the arched bridge, then quickly climbed up the obstacle ladder at lightning speed.
0:21:13|0:21:26|Shortly after, [Zhu Guangsheng] bent down at the finish line, arms outstretched. [Lan Bo] leaped over his back, landing smoothly. Zhu then twirled his mop handle, striking a dramatic pose, and playfully frolicked with [Lan Bo].
0:21:30|0:21:48|The soaring [Blue Wave] grabbed [Zhu Guangsheng]'s hat and walked towards home, while [Zhu Lin] who was standing aside, bounced over to [Zhu Guangsheng] and linked arms with him, walking behind [Blue Wave]. A year later, as a forest ranger, [Zhu Guangsheng] walked in the snow leading a horse to search for mountains.
0:21:54|0:22:4|He was unaware that the snow wolf lurking deep in the forest was staring at him intently, with [Lan Bo] running ahead as if sensing something, heading towards the depths of the forest.
0:22:4|0:22:30|[Zhu Guangsheng] tied the horse to a tree, but suddenly heard the sound of an electric drill. At that moment, he became alert and discovered footprints extending into the depths of the forest in the snow. He glanced at [Zhang Biao] beside him and then gave an order. The well-trained [Zhang Biao] instinctively rushed out, with [Zhu Guangsheng] following closely behind. Nearby, the snow wolf licked its tongue as if waiting for a meal.
0:22:32|0:22:43|Zhu Guangsheng, who didn't pay attention to his footing, fell to the ground. Seeing the villain escaping, he quickly got up and chased after him. The brave Zhang Biao closely followed, seizing the opportunity to bite the villain's arm.
0:22:43|0:22:55|and dragged him on the ground. At this moment, the villain kept rolling, trying to break free from [Blue Wave]'s bite, but [Blue Wave] didn't give him a chance to catch his breath, biting him tightly. The next day, in a great mood, [Zhu Guangsheng] hummed a tune.
0:22:55|0:23:4|As the eight large characters "Reforesting to Green the Motherland" on the side of the house were being repainted, at that moment, the police car stopped by the road, and Director Liu got out of the car and shouted at his back, [Director Liu].
0:23:17|0:23:22|[Zhu Guangsheng]'s movements began to slow down.
0:23:30|0:23:34|[Zhu Guangsheng] stopped his actions and turned to look at [Director Liu],
0:23:51|0:24:0|Director Liu started the car and drove away, watching Zhu Guangsheng go far away. At this moment, Zhu Guangsheng furrowed his brows and looked down slowly, saying with concern,
0:24:18|0:24:38|The man then took off his sunglasses and looked at [Changzi]. At that moment, [Changzi], who was standing by the table, looked at [Zhang Biao] in surprise. In the other corner of the guard station, Old Zhu was sitting by the stove, adjusting the hook made of twisted steel wire with pliers. Just as he was trying to flatten the bottom of the hook, Director Liu suddenly opened the door and looked at him, saying,
0:25:0|0:25:15|Old Zhu looked at Director Liu in front of him, gesturing for him to sit down with his right hand holding pliers. Then Old Zhu put down the hook that had already been formed in his hand, turned off the radio, and looked at him seriously, saying,
0:25:19|0:25:32|Director Liu, who was already seated, looked up as Old Zhu, with a smile on his face, lowered his head to focus on the task at hand.
0:25:42|0:26:6|With a furrowed brow, Zhu Guangsheng rubbed his hands on the stove and stopped his actions, pursing his lips. He suddenly looked up at Director Liu, then put down what he was holding and calmly said, not realizing he had done anything wrong.
0:26:27|0:26:32|The atmosphere in the room was extremely tense at this moment, and the two of them did not notice when [Zhu Lin] walked in.
0:27:10|0:27:16|Following [Zhu Cong]'s pull of the trigger, as the gunshot rang out, the screen was covered in blood, with someone holding a hunting rifle in the snowy field.
0:27:20|0:27:24|After finishing speaking, [Changzi] turned around, closed his eyes tightly, and gasped heavily.
0:27:31|0:27:49|Changzi turned to Zhang Biao in shock, while Zhang Biao, who was looking for prey, put away his hunting gun and walked forward. Clumsy Changzi quickly picked up the rabbit on the ground and ran towards Zhang Biao. He grabbed Zhang Biao, almost slipping, and once he steadied himself, he said,
0:27:55|0:28:4|[Zhang Biao] walked forward absentmindedly, [Changzi] immediately caught up. [Zhang Biao] stepped heavily on the snow, staring blankly at a spot not far away.
0:28:7|0:28:30|After listening to [Changzi]'s words, [Zhang Biao] instantly understood something. He then threw the bag containing the hunting rifle into the bushes. Slowly, he walked to the bag, squatted down, took off his gloves, raised the rifle, aimed at Old Zhu's dog yard, scanned every dog, and finally aimed at the dog lying on the ground. His intense desire for revenge blinded his eyes, and without hesitation, he pulled the trigger.
0:28:30|0:28:44|The bullet swiftly pierced through the dog's head, and after a few whimpers, the dog fell into a pool of blood. Meanwhile, the snow wolf on the mountain was watching from afar. Inside the forest station at night, [Zhu Guangsheng] gazed blankly out the window.
0:29:9|0:29:15|While the two were talking, the dog outside the window kept barking. Upon hearing the noise, [Zhu Guangsheng] immediately looked towards it.
0:29:22|0:29:29|Don't do anything stupid. Soon after, [Zhu Guangsheng] in military coat, holding his drumstick, walked towards a residential house. Upon reaching the front gate, he urgently knocked on the door.
0:29:29|0:29:40|Seeing that no one opened the door, he increased the force in his hands. On the other side of the dog yard, [Zhang Biao] and [Changzi] sneaked into the kennel, where the dogs, sensing unfamiliar scents, kept barking incessantly.
0:29:40|0:29:54|Walking ahead, [Zhang Biao] suddenly turned around and reached out his hand to [Changzi]. Understanding the signal, [Changzi] immediately handed over the stick in his hand. [Zhang Biao] took the stick and continued walking forward, while Blue Wave, locked in the cage, watched them calmly.
0:29:54|0:29:59|The next day, [Zhu Lin] anxiously opened the door and said to [Zhu Guangsheng], who was washing up,
0:30:6|0:30:19|[Zhu Guangsheng] carefully observed the object in his hand, furrowing his brows. Slowly, [Zhu Guangsheng] lifted his head, and the blue waves were locked on the iron fence.
0:30:37|0:30:52|The chef holding the money looked at the locked Lanbo, bypassed [Changzi], and walked towards the house. Meanwhile, [Changzi], chewing gum, remained in place, watching Lanbo struggling and showing a lewd smile. After Lanbo exhaustedly collapsed on the ground, [Changzi] was satisfied and turned to leave.
0:30:52|0:31:9|When Lanbo saw him reaching for the chicken in the cage, he immediately stood up and stared closely at his back. Lanbo kept scratching at the iron gate with his claws and tried to climb over it, but ultimately failed. [Changzi] walked towards the kitchen with the chicken, [Lanbo] barked loudly, only to have the iron chain snapped.
0:31:25|0:31:48|The two of them came to the road, looking for the figure of [Lan Bo]. The cook pointed forward with a stick, but before they took a few steps, [Changzi] sat on the cook's lap. At that moment, [Lan Bo] suddenly stopped, turned around, and saw them about to catch up. [Lan Bo] immediately jumped into the abandoned courtyard, went through the window into the house, while [Changzi] and the cook kicked open the iron gate.
0:31:54|0:32:21|The nervous chef sat at the dining table, constantly tapping the tabletop with chopsticks. Suddenly, the door was pushed open, and he saw that it was Zhu Guangsheng leaning against the door. He hurried over to Zhu's side. Zhu entered the room unhurriedly, cautiously looking around and seeing no one. He then asked, and the chef, feeling flustered, hurried into the kitchen.
0:32:21|0:32:30|Old Zhu walked slowly towards the large bowl of meat and wine on the table, pulling out the chair in the middle of the table. However, instead of sitting down directly, he glanced in the direction of the kitchen.
0:32:30|0:32:56|He lifted his clothes and took out a big drum hammer tied around his waist, hiding it in his sleeve. After completing all the precautions, Old Zhu sat on the stool, concealing the anger in his heart. He looked ahead expressionlessly. At this moment, the half-open door was pushed open from the outside. Old Zhu turned his head slightly towards the direction of the door, only to see a person in black leather boots walking in. After closing the door, the person approached Old Zhu.
0:32:56|0:33:19|At this moment, Old Zhu turned his head disdainfully, and [Zhang Biao], who walked up to him, first placed his hand on his shoulder, then stared at him sharply with a piercing gaze. Bending down and leaning his face next to his, [Zhang Biao] casually said, "..." Old Zhu, who faced him with courage in the face of danger, met his eyes for the first time. It was a year ago when he was caught.
0:33:19|0:33:32|At that time, he hated Zhu Guangsheng for bringing the police. Now, Zhang Biao is seeking revenge on Zhu Guangsheng, causing his family to be ruined. He then patted Zhu Guangsheng on the shoulder and slowly walked towards the center of the long table.
0:33:46|0:34:17|After finishing speaking, he picked up the white wine on the table and poured it into the empty glass. When the wine reached one-third of the glass, he closed the bottle. At this moment, Old Zhu ignored him, so he placed the glass in front of Old Zhu. Old Zhu, who didn't understand the meaning of this action, looked up at him. Old Zhu, who was glancing sideways at Zhang Biao, did not get angry because of his words. He disdainfully shifted his gaze to the table, placed his arm with the big drumstick hidden on the left side on the table, and then picked up the glass of white wine with his right hand and took a big sip.
0:34:17|0:34:24|After hesitating for a moment, [Zhu Guangsheng] picked up a piece of meat from the basin and stuffed it into his mouth, chewing non-stop.
0:34:29|0:34:36|Shortly after, a wave of nausea surged in Zhu's heart, and he leaned over the table and vomited all the meat out. Zhang Biao, with a smug expression, burst into uncontrollable laughter.
0:34:40|0:34:46|[Zhu Guangsheng]’s face changed drastically, the angry [Zhu Guangsheng] pulled out a big drum hammer and swung it towards [Zhang Biao].
0:34:52|0:35:12|Seeing [Zhang Biao] lifting a stool and smashing it towards [Zhu Guangsheng], [Blue Wave] rushed in and bit his arm. [Zhu Cong] and [Zhu Lin] followed, and as [Zhang Biao] broke free from the jaws of [Blue Wave], he was kicked to the ground by [Zhu Guangsheng]. Breathing heavily, [Zhu Guangsheng] first looked at his daughters, then walked to the table to calm down the agitated [Blue Wave] after seeing [Zhang Biao] lying on the ground.
0:35:16|0:35:40|Shortly after, [Zhu Guangsheng] turned to look at [Changzi] and the cook, who were scared in the corner by [Lan Bo]. Realizing that they were not bad people, he turned around and once again hid the drumstick on the table in his sleeve. Burning with anger at this moment, he looked at the unharmed [Lan Bo] and was unwilling to argue further. He then turned and walked towards the exit, but was stopped by [Zhang Biao] who was lying on the ground after a few steps. He looked at [Zhang Biao] helplessly.
0:35:40|0:35:44|Sensible [Zhang Biao] immediately moved aside to make way.
0:35:46|0:36:35|[Zhu Guangsheng] walked out of the room, followed closely by his two daughters. Then [Zhang Biao] slowly stood up, glaring fiercely at [Changzi]. Nervously, [Changzi] recounted the details of [Lan Bo]'s escape to [Zhang Biao]. The two of them chased [Lan Bo] to an abandoned courtyard. When they saw [Lan Bo] hiding in a corner, they tried to scare him with sticks, but the fearless [Lan Bo] quickly jumped out of the window when he found an opportunity. As the two of them carefully searched every corner of the room, [Lan Bo] climbed out through a hole in the wall. Standing on the street, the two of them were distracted by a passing lamb, while [Changzi], lost in thought, suddenly had an idea after a moment of contemplation and confidently said to add more cooking wine.
0:36:39|0:36:52|In a fit of anger, [Zhang Biao] overturned the long table, causing the two people in the corner to be scared and slump against the wall again. However, [Zhang Biao] looked at them with a smile on his face.
0:37:3|0:37:10|Director Liu, who was patrolling, saw a man leading a horse not far away and shouted,
0:37:22|0:37:31|After Director Liu finished speaking, he drove away. The village chief continued to lead the horse forward, and then his colleagues helped Director Liu make a phone call and put it next to his ear.
0:37:42|0:38:1|On the other side, [Zhu Guangsheng] listened to the phone call and then walked towards the sheep pen with a hemp rope and a bundle of hay. The little lambs kept bleating when they saw [Zhu Guangsheng] approaching. After a moment of hesitation, [Zhu Guangsheng] first slung the hemp rope over his shoulder, then separated the hay and threw them in four different directions. He watched the little lambs huddled in a corner.
0:38:1|0:38:9|His gaze finally landed on the smallest one, then [Zhu Guangsheng], who was stewing the meat, started cutting the vegetables.
0:38:29|0:38:35|After Director Liu finished speaking, he opened the bottle of wine and started pouring, but Zhu Guangsheng's mind was on the newly made tobacco pipe.
0:38:54|0:39:1|Director Liu put down Zhu Guangsheng's bowl, picked up his own bowl with chopsticks, and immediately put a piece into his mouth.
0:39:3|0:39:16|Director Liu, who couldn't bear it in his heart, said while eating meat, Zhu Guangsheng, expressionless, expressed great helplessness about the matter. Director Liu, deep in thought, furrowed his brow.
0:39:26|0:39:40|After Zhu Guangsheng spoke frankly, he sat up straight, extended his hands to look at him. Director Liu ignored him and instead put down the bowl and chopsticks, took out a large amount of cash from his jacket pocket and handed it to him.
0:39:54|0:39:57|Director Liu stood up and snatched it back, and after sitting down, he put the money back in place.
0:40:12|0:40:18|Director Liu, called inexplicably by Lan Bo, looked up and asked Zhu Guangsheng.
0:40:22|0:40:28|Director Liu looked at Zhu Guangsheng in disbelief, his face filled with shock. The more he thought about it, the more nauseated he became, and he immediately spat out all the meat in his mouth.
0:40:36|0:40:57|He gulped down the wine in his hand, and at this moment, Lanbo also stopped making noise, quietly lying on the ground watching [Zhu Guangsheng]. The next day, [Zhu Guangsheng] with his old partner and two daughters were picking up trash near the dog field. He carried a large bamboo basket in front, [Zhu Cong] carried a small basket and [Zhu Lin] walked beside him. The old partner on the hillside was picking up trash alone, and the sensible Lanbo carried the trash towards [Zhu Guangsheng].
0:40:57|0:41:9|They tied the collected plastic bags to the fence of the dog farm, adding a different scene to the monotonous Tianshan Forest.
0:41:16|0:41:28|In the dog kennel, Zhu Guangsheng and two others stood up and walked towards the outside. The man at the front stood at the door, patted his arm, then turned to Zhu Guangsheng behind him and said,
0:41:30|0:41:36|After the veterinarian finished speaking, [Zhu Guangsheng] turned to look at the dog kennel, the anxious [Zhu Guangsheng] softly asked the veterinarian,
0:41:54|0:42:5|Upon hearing the price, [Zhu Guangsheng] instinctively clenched his fists, unable to bear giving up these dogs. As he bid farewell to the doctor, he stared blankly at the hat in his hand, while on the other side, [Zhu Guangsheng]'s wife rummaged through boxes and cabinets searching for something.
0:42:5|0:42:12|In a fit of anger, she slammed the empty handbag on the table in front of Zhu Guangsheng, who was drinking.
0:42:12|0:42:27|[Zhu Guangsheng] held a bottle of wine in one hand, feeling troubled, he spoke slowly. His wife, who was beside him, impatiently tapped her foot. [Zhu Guangsheng] lowered his head nervously and replied calmly. Hearing his response, his wife, filled with anger, heavily slapped [Zhu Guangsheng] on the shoulder.
0:42:37|0:42:44|[Zhu Guangsheng], who was mentioned, shamelessly continued to speak.
0:42:50|0:43:1|[Zhu Guangsheng] glanced at his gasping wife with the corner of his eye, full of regret and no expression on his face. Just as he was about to pick up the wine glass, his wife snatched it from him and threw it to the ground.
0:43:39|0:43:50|The provocation from his wife's words made [Zhu Guangsheng] even more irritable at the moment. As his wife struggled to get up from the ground, she said,
0:43:51|0:44:13|After his wife walked out of the room without looking back, enraged [Zhu Guangsheng] stared at the handbag on the table and angrily threw it to the ground. [Zhu Guangsheng] was torn between two choices, caught in endless dilemma. He looked at the blue waves in front of him, sticking out their tongues at him, but in the end, he stuck to his inner self. The azure sky framed the towering mountain peaks, with endless forests winding below the snow line.
0:44:13|0:44:19|[Zhu Guangsheng] sat on the hillside with a radio and a blue wave, settling his anxious mood.
0:44:25|0:44:39|[Zhu Guangsheng] stopped his movements, placed the water bottle down, and took the money handed to him by [Dr. Niu]. With a light flick of his fingers, he began to count the money. Just then, a mountain bike slowly came to a stop in front of his house.
0:45:8|0:45:16|[Zhu Guangsheng] lowered his head in confusion, and after a moment of contemplation, he sighed softly and looked at Boss Qin, pleading,
0:45:32|0:45:37|Boss Qin pulled the man selling sheep intestines away, while [Zhu Guangsheng] stood in place watching them leave.
0:45:40|0:46:5|[Zhu Guangsheng] looked helplessly at the limited cash in his hand. In the afternoon, as he was washing the horse on the slope, [Zhu Cong] shouted. After speaking, she turned her head and continued to be busy with the work in her hands. [Zhu Cong] urged Lanbo to walk towards the intersection. She carried a single-shoulder bag, with both hands in her pockets. Curious Lanbo followed her, trying to get her attention.
0:46:5|0:46:24|As she reached the doorway, she suddenly stopped in her tracks, turned to look at her father's busy figure, [Zhu Cong] couldn't bear to see her father in such distress. She then lowered her head and took out a small stack of money from her pocket, spreading the money out in her hand. Looking at the meager amount of money, she hoped to do her best to help her father with what little she had.
0:46:24|0:46:43|He watched as Lanbo returned to his father and then turned to leave. [Zhu Guangsheng] heard Lanbo calling out and turned back, only to see Lanbo running towards him. He opened his arms and embraced Lanbo, but as he was comforting him, he suddenly noticed some money attached to Lanbo's dog chain. He took the money off and looked in the direction where [Zhu Cong] had left.
0:46:43|0:47:8|At this moment, [Zhu Guangsheng] was feeling a mix of emotions in his heart. He looked at the dog kennel he had built at the foot of the mountain with his own hands, and recalled recent events with deep regret. He stood under the national flag in front of the kennel, solemnly put on his hat, let out a long sigh, and then set off. Before long, his feet were on the stairs. After hesitating for a moment, he took heavy steps to the pawnshop's door, pushed it open, and handed over the property deed.
0:47:39|0:47:58|[Zhu Lin] leaned against the rock, holding Lanbo in his arms, swallowing his tears. [Zhu Cong] turned and walked towards the mountain, but halfway through, he turned back. After speaking, [Zhu Cong] angrily turned and walked down the hill. The sorrowful [Zhu Lin] held Lanbo in his arms, feeling heartbroken and unwilling to give away the Lanbo he had raised with his own hands.
0:47:58|0:48:12|In the luxurious villa, [Zhu Cong] turning around as she walks out, [Zhu Lin] who is walking outside looks back unwillingly. She pouts and walks to the side of the gate, then she leans against the iron gate and caresses [Wang Rong] who is tied up with reluctance.
0:48:13|0:48:22|[Zhu Cong] forcibly dragged [Zhu Lin] away, ignoring [Wang Rong]'s pleas as she refused to let go. As the two approached the shuttle bus, [Zhu Cong] instructed [Zhu Lin] to walk ahead, and in that moment of boarding the bus,
0:48:22|0:48:47|[Zhu Lin] wanted to take another look at [Wang Rong], but [Zhu Cong] pushed her directly onto the bus. As the two got on the bus, [Wang Rong] lay on the iron gate, howling continuously through the air. The bus started and drove away, and the anxious [Wang Rong] realized the danger. It suddenly broke free from the rope around its neck and swiftly ran out of the gate towards the direction the bus was heading. By this time, the bus had already left the urban area and was driving on a winding mountain road.
0:48:47|0:49:4|Wang Rong, who is trying her best, closely follows behind the bus, while Zhu Lin inside the bus sits with a worried expression, and Zhu Cong sitting behind her keeps comforting her. Soon, the bus arrives at the pasture, and as it passes through the woods, a small figure can still be seen chasing after the bus.
0:49:4|0:49:17|When [Wang Rong] arrived at the forest, the bus stopped. She stood at the fork in the road, looking left and right constantly. Watching the bus getting further away, she glanced at the side road and, torn between choices, she ultimately chose to trust herself.
0:49:18|0:49:24|It swiftly crossed the snow-covered fields, and immediately after crossing the wall, it agilely climbed over the mountains with its strong limbs.
0:49:25|0:49:42|As a forest ranger's beloved dog, [Wang Rong] is quite familiar with the terrain here and always manages to find a shortcut home. At this moment, the two sisters have already gotten off the bus and are walking on the mountain path, while [Wang Rong], who is looking for the way home, immediately runs towards a familiar figure.
0:49:43|0:50:2|Originally frowning, [Zhu Lin] quickly took out the hand in his pocket upon hearing [Wang Rong]'s call, and ran towards Lanbo with all his might. Overjoyed, [Zhu Lin] knelt on the ground, embracing [Wang Rong], while behind them, [Zhu Cong] looked at [Wang Rong] in shock. She never expected that [Wang Rong] would find her way home alone.
0:50:2|0:50:11|At this moment, [Wang Rong] buried her head in [Zhu Lin]'s arms, coquettish. In the evening, a divorce agreement was placed diagonally on the table by the bed. Old Zhu sat by the stove and said,
0:50:17|0:50:43|Wife, with no expression on her face, looks at the photo on the wall. The once loving couple has now reached this point. [Zhu Guangsheng] decides to shoulder all the responsibilities. His wife remains unmoved, still staring at the photo. [Zhu Guangsheng] drinks up the wine in his hand in frustration. At this moment, even if he is reluctant, he must learn to let go. He doesn't want to burden his wife and children, making them suffer with him.
0:50:44|0:51:8|He then slowly tightened the cap of the bottle, as if sealing this past memory in the bottle. He gently placed the bottle on the box beside him, looking at it. He let out a deep sigh, then picked up the hat beside him, stood up, and walked towards the door with heavy steps. After a few steps, he stopped. Standing at the bedroom door, he lowered his head and said to his wife's back,
0:51:13|0:51:39|After saying goodbye to his wife without any response, he walked out of the room. His wife stood in front of the cabinet, looking at herself through the glass of the photo frame. She held back tears, not letting them fall. The frames on the wall were filled with photos of their two daughters when they were young, each photo with a dog next to it. Outside the house, the world was covered in white, with snowflakes falling gently from the dim sky.
0:51:39|0:52:0|Covering the world with a thick blanket, [Zhu Guangsheng] walked along the path with Blue Wave gradually fading away. On the other side, his wife sat by the stove holding a divorce agreement, looking lost and staring blankly ahead. Exhausted, [Zhu Guangsheng] sat on a snow-covered log halfway up the hill, with Blue Wave obediently sitting beside him.
0:52:0|0:52:15|At this moment, he felt an immense emptiness in his heart. The once warm and happy home now only had one person and a dog left. It was unknown how long it had been, but [Zhu Guangsheng] and Lanbo were also covered in a layer of snow. In the distance, the mountain peaks were stacked layer upon layer, covered with one layer of white snow after another.
0:52:15|0:52:34|Like towering waves in the sea. The next morning, the snow continued to fall, with snowflakes fluttering down accompanied by the chilly winter wind, giving a sense of loneliness. After packing up the luggage, the wife hung the room key on the wall outside the door, holding a bag in one hand, and walked out with heavy steps.
0:52:34|0:52:37|It's hard to imagine things would develop to such an extent.
0:52:37|0:52:57|As she walked halfway up the slope, she was immediately drawn to the windmill in front of her. The windmill stood tall in the wind and snow, constantly turning with a creaking sound that evoked memories for the two. Just as she slowly lowered her head, she saw the dog farm opposite. The dog farm was also covered with snow at this moment, with only the five-starred red flag hanging in the air fluttering in the wind.
0:52:58|0:53:4|For some unknown reason, the dogs in the dog yard kept barking incessantly, perhaps calling for [Zhu Guangsheng] to come home.
0:53:4|0:53:25|At this moment, the wife also realized that she should not have tried to extinguish [Zhu Guangsheng]'s dream. Without fully understanding the situation, she angrily blamed [Zhu Guangsheng]. Now, she continued along the path, kicking at the door of [Zhang Biao]'s house. When [Zhang Biao] opened the door, she simply pushed it open, causing the bottle at the door to fall.
0:53:31|0:53:38|[Zhang Biao] leaned against the door frame and looked at her helplessly. She vented her anger on [Zhang Biao], who in turn questioned her.
0:53:56|0:54:17|Before [Zhang Biao] could finish speaking, tears welled up in her eyes, but [Zhang Biao] paid no attention and simply reached out to close the door. His wife, standing outside the door, helplessly sobbed, then turned around and leaned against the nearby railing to compose herself. However, when she saw the countless bottles lined up on the steps outside the door, she fell into deep thought.
0:54:17|0:54:35|On the other side, many elderly and middle-aged people are rehearsing in an orderly manner on the square. With lively music, they dance joyfully to the beat of the drums. A police car comes into view and slowly stops in front of several women. The women then approach, and Director Liu gets out of the car and says,
0:54:50|0:55:12|Several women forcibly pushed [Director Liu] onto the dance floor, but he showed no fear at all. He stood in the center of the crowd, moving effortlessly and maintaining his dignity. His movements were perfectly timed with the music, and just as he was enjoying the happiness brought by dancing, his phone suddenly rang. He took out his phone while still following the rhythm.
0:55:20|0:55:29|Old Zhu sat dejectedly on the grassy bank, then he slowly lifted his head to look at [Director Liu]. In an instant, understanding dawned on [Director Liu], who dropped his cigarette butt and walked towards him, saying,
0:55:43|0:55:58|Old Zhu pursed his lips and buried his head in the scarf, Director Liu walked to his side and patted his shoulder, gesturing for him to move to the other side. Then Director Liu sat down next to him, while Old Zhu remained stubborn.
0:56:10|0:56:36|Director Liu saw Zhu Guangsheng unmoved, so he punched him. Zhu Guangsheng was now staring at the ground in a flustered state. Director Liu, feeling angry, stood up and walked to face Zhu Guangsheng directly. Zhu Guangsheng then lifted his head and squinted at him. Director Liu pointed at him and scolded, then helplessly stood up straight. Director Liu, in anger, was about to put his hands in his pockets, but before he could, he pointed at Zhu Guangsheng.
0:56:41|0:56:48|After Director Liu finished speaking, he started the car and drove past Old Zhu, who raised his head and watched him leave.
0:56:48|0:57:0|[Zhu Guangsheng] looked pensive as he held the whip in his hand. In the hospital, his wife entered the ward carrying fruits. She first glanced at the patient next to her being taken care of by family members, while the patient in front of her was lying on the side, asleep.
0:57:0|0:57:10|She gently placed the fruit on the bedside table, then pushed the woman after observing carefully. The woman woke up inexplicably and turned her head slowly to look at [Zhu Guangsheng]'s wife.
0:57:32|0:57:52|The wife then began to tidy up. Upon hearing that it was their son's arrangement, the woman felt relieved. On the other side, [Zhu Guangsheng] carried a large bamboo basket and walked towards the deep mountains. He then shoveled the pristine snow into the basket bit by bit. When the snow exceeded the basket, he even patted it with a shovel. Exhausted, he leaned the shovel against the ground.
0:57:53|0:58:14|With one hand holding a shovel and the other adjusting his hat, [Zhu Guangsheng] then hoisted the bamboo basket onto his back and carefully made his way back along the uneven mountain path, afraid of spilling the snow inside the basket. Upon returning home, [Zhu Guangsheng] emptied the snow from the bamboo basket into a large iron basin. He placed the basket on the ground, breathing heavily, and then scooped up a handful of snow to eat.
0:58:14|0:58:28|While he continued to chew, he also observed the snow in the basin. Then he took out the burning charcoal from the stove and placed it under the basin. As he adjusted the charcoal, his eldest daughter [Zhu Cong] entered through the door and walked slowly forward.
0:58:36|0:58:43|After Zhu Guangsheng finished speaking, he stood up. The two of them looked at the accumulated snow in the basin. Zhu Guangsheng wiped the iron tongs in his hand.
0:58:49|0:58:58|[Zhu Cong] nodded in response. Then [Zhu Guangsheng] walked out of the door with a bamboo basket, [Zhu Cong] stood behind watching his father's figure disappear at the moment the door closed.
0:58:58|0:59:16|The thick snow in the basin gradually melted under the heating of charcoal. The father's love for his children is deep and broad. They only know how to silently give without expressing it in words. He needs to take on the responsibility of being a father and be responsible for the family. As the snow water continued to heat up, steam soon rose.
0:59:16|0:59:39|[Zhu Lin] stepped into the iron basin with the help of her sister. With her thin body, her back resembled layers of overlapping mountain peaks. Her slender arms naturally hung on both sides of her body. At this moment, she let her hair down and lowered her head, watching her sister wash her straight long legs. Then she bent over as her sister poured water over her head with a ladle. But just as her sister turned around to fetch more water, she suddenly shook her head.
0:59:39|0:59:49|The splashing water landed on the sister's face, and she immediately grabbed a handful of water and sprinkled it towards [Zhu Lin]. [Zhu Lin] instinctively dodged the water coming towards her face, and soon she was all washed up.
0:59:49|0:59:59|Later, Old Zhu used a shovel to scoop out the charcoal at the bottom of the basin and put it back into the furnace. Then he placed the stool and basin in the corner of the basin. Just as he was cleaning up, [Wang Rong] jumped into the basin.
1:0:4|1:0:27|Old Zhu walked to [Wang Rong], constantly stroking its head. Then he took off his coat, sat on a stool, carefully wiped [Wang Rong], and used a water ladle to rinse it. While rinsing, he kept rubbing it with his hands. After Old Zhu finished washing [Wang Rong], it playfully shook its fur. Meanwhile, [Changzi] dashed into the pool, splashing water onto the face of [Zhang Biao] nearby.
1:0:40|1:0:46|After finishing speaking, [Zhang Biao] tilted his head back, looking pensive. Suddenly, [Zhang Biao] turned to [Changzi].
1:0:51|1:1:2|[Zhang Biao] waved his hand in the water, signaling for [Changzi] to come forward. The two locked eyes, plotting something unknown. Inside the dance hall, [Changzi] pulled [Zhu Cong] aside and said,
1:1:8|1:1:43|[Zhu Cong]'s expression instantly became tense. [Zhu Cong] grabbed [Changzi], who was about to leave. [Changzi] frowned, not understanding [Zhu Cong]'s actions. After speaking, [Changzi] helplessly turned and left. [Zhu Cong] then instantly slumped against the wall. Old Zhu from the deep mountains walked with a horse on a snowy slope. The higher he went up the mountain, the deeper the snow became. He struggled to move forward in the snow that reached above his knees.
1:1:43|1:2:4|Wearing heavy clothes, he kept panting heavily. After climbing up the hill, he mounted the horse to continue his patrol. Gradually, he, along with a dog, disappeared from view. Meanwhile, [Changzi] slowly climbed the stairs. He walked up to [Zhang Biao] and, while panting heavily, handed him a black bottle. [Zhang Biao] took the bottle and carefully examined the sulfuric acid written on it.
1:2:5|1:2:32|At night, the colorful lights in the nightclub flickered above, accompanied by strong drumbeats. The dancers gracefully danced, and on the stage, [Zhu Cong] had already noticed [Zhang Biao] sitting in the audience. Her slender silk dress fluttered in the wind, the swirling long sleeves crisscrossed, and her continuous movements danced and scattered. Her twisting body merged hands and feet, with a light and agile posture, as light as a swallow, as soft as a cloud, her arms delicate and boneless, every step giving rise to a lotus, her flower-like dance moves, like butterflies dancing among the flowers.
1:2:32|1:2:35|Tugging at [Zhang Biao]'s heart.
1:2:35|1:2:53|At this moment, [Zhang Biao] stared at [Zhu Cong] on the stage, afraid that he had already forgotten the purpose of his visit. While dancing, [Zhu Cong] also glanced at [Zhang Biao] from time to time. Her charming big eyes made [Zhang Biao] intoxicated, marveling at her elegant and graceful radiance.
1:2:53|1:3:7|Her every move tugs at [Zhang Biao]'s heartstrings. As she completes the final move, she fixes a coquettish gaze on [Zhang Biao], then slowly exits. Below the stage, [Zhang Biao] watches her departure with reluctance.
1:3:7|1:3:23|Later, as [Zhu Cong] walked out of the nightclub, someone suddenly called out to her. Two people approached her, [Zhang Biao] turned around and, with his eyes, accused [Changzi].
1:4:11|1:4:19|[Zhang Biao] grabbed [Zhu Cong] but was quickly overpowered by her. After saying a few words, she released [Zhang Biao] and walked away without looking back.
1:4:33|1:4:38|When [Zhang Biao] was about to leave, [Changzi] immediately called out to him.
1:4:43|1:4:53|After saying that, he turned and left. Then, [Changzi] used his mouth to open the bottle cap and took a big gulp.
1:5:5|1:5:15|She then looked at [Zhang Biao] and said, the sudden praise from [Zhang Biao] made [Zhu Cong] ecstatic. Shocked beyond belief, [Zhu Cong] never expected that [Zhang Biao] would go to great lengths to raise 100,000 yuan for her.
1:5:20|1:5:35|At this moment, [Zhang Biao], who was deeply in love, immediately turned and walked out of the room upon hearing these words. [Changzi] glanced at [Zhu Cong] and followed suit. Later, [Zhang Biao] tidied up and arrived at [Zhu Cong]'s house. He walked briskly to Old Zhu with a gift box in his hands.
1:6:10|1:6:20|Old Zhu looked at [Zhang Biao] in front of him, suppressing the anger in his heart. He didn't understand why this person always appeared in his life. So he walked slowly forward, staring at [Zhang Biao] and rebuked angrily,
1:7:4|1:7:14|Lan Bo was tightly held by the old buddy from the dog farm, Old Zhu's eyes were full of anger. He then went to the place where [Zhu Cong] worked, followed closely by [Zhu Lin]. Old Zhu walked up to [Zhu Cong] and slapped her directly in the face.
1:7:52|1:8:12|[Zhu Cong] vented all the words that had been buried deep in her heart. After speaking, she turned and left. Seeing this, [Zhu Lin] immediately chased after her. At this moment, the old Zhu was deeply struck in his heart by [Zhu Cong]'s words. He didn't know that all he had insisted on had brought so much harm to this family. He stood helplessly as if frozen in place, unable to move for a long time, watching [Zhu Cong]'s gradually disappearing figure.
1:8:12|1:8:23|Filled with guilt, [Zhu Guangsheng] returned home at night and lit the candle in the corner with a lighter. Then he took out the seal and placed it in front of the mirror. He turned the pot upside down and wiped it with his fingers.
1:8:42|1:9:2|Old Zhu outlined the makeup of Wusheng with simple materials, then he stood on a half slope, wearing a mouthpiece made of a ponytail and accompanied by Peking opera music. He accurately stepped on every drum beat, with a wide and loud tone, singing with a strong and thick voice, and his movements were distinct and abrupt. [Zhu Guangsheng] and the old buddy from the dog farm sat on both sides of the bonfire.
1:9:46|1:9:58|He is wearing a disguised mask at the moment, but his intellect deep inside is awakened. Under the moonlight, he looks into the distance, trying hard not to let tears flow again. He uses the song to shout out all the pent-up frustration in his heart.
1:10:8|1:10:30|He shouted out his inner dissatisfaction with the climax of the opera, his face turning red, veins bulging on his neck, the entire canyon echoing with his voice. Gradually, he calmed down, tears in his eyes as he slowly looked up at the endless night sky. The moon was half hidden behind the mountains, still shining brightly.
1:10:30|1:10:49|Returning to the room, [Zhu Guangsheng] looked at himself in the mirror, tears uncontrollably streaming down his face. The fragmented mirror reflected different angles of him, and with a furrowed brow, he comforted himself by saying that he silently gave his all behind the scenes, but most of the pain was something he had to bear alone.
1:10:49|1:11:6|Tears streaming down his face, he looked at his weathered self in front of him. As he spoke with a choked voice, he ultimately buried all his thoughts deep in his heart. Then, he let out a deep sigh and bowed to his reflection in the mirror. In the hospital, [Zhang Biao] was washing towels in a basin.
1:11:16|1:11:28|He wiped the water on his hands on his pants, bent down to support his mother's shoulders, helping her sit up slowly. After tidying up the blanket, he sat behind his mother and reached the towel into her clothes, helping her wipe her back.
1:11:41|1:11:50|The mother slowly turned her head to look at [Zhang Biao] in front of her, her brows furrowed in contemplation.
1:12:12|1:12:18|At this moment, [Zhang Biao] stopped his actions and looked at his mother.
1:12:24|1:12:30|The atmosphere between the two suddenly became poignant, with [Zhang Biao] tightly hugging his mother.
1:12:32|1:12:56|After speaking, she leaned on [Zhang Biao]'s shoulder, holding onto his arms tightly, while the Zhang Biao behind her held his mother, trying to hold back tears. The next morning, Lao Zhu walked in the deep mountains with a dog, surrounded by white mist. The nearby flowers, grass, and trees appeared and disappeared in the thick fog. He struggled to climb the hill with the dog, occasionally stopping to observe the surroundings. On the other side, [Zhu Cong] with a shoulder bag walked out of the gate.
1:12:56|1:13:14|Walking on the familiar path as usual, Zhu Rong suddenly felt someone following her. When she entered the alley, she looked back but didn't see anything. However, she quickened her pace and the person behind her started to run when she disappeared from his sight.
1:13:14|1:13:27|At this moment, [Zhu Cong] also ran into the alley. She carefully observed her surroundings, and seeing no one around, she quickly took a shortcut and ran out. Startled, [Zhu Cong] left after confirming the situation. However, when she reached the middle of two cars, she was suddenly stopped.
1:14:2|1:14:15|After speaking, he turned to look at [Zhu Cong], who was so scared by the knife in front of him that he dared not make a sound. Just then, the traffic police officer maintaining order on the opposite side walked over. [Zhang Biao] in the car instantly became nervous, while [Changzi] immediately turned around and rolled down the driver's window.
1:14:28|1:14:35|The car continued to drive on. In the hospital on the other side, Zhang Biao's mother was talking to Zhu Guangsheng's wife.
1:14:43|1:14:52|After listening, Old Zhu's wife became cautious in an instant. With a furrowed brow, she pondered repeatedly. The thick snow in the deep mountains was trampled by the three of them.
1:14:52|1:15:14|With light footprints, [Zhang Biao] walked at the front, looking around, while the fat man behind struggled to move forward with the bound [Zhu Cong]. Under the clear sky and gentle breeze, the snow-capped mountains stood against the deep blue sky, sitting on the vast land. Fluffy white clouds lightly surrounded the waist of the majestic mountains. At the foot of the mountain, there was a dense green forest of pines and cypresses.
1:15:14|1:15:30|At the same time, Zhu Guangsheng continued to shuttle through the misty deep mountains with his dog. Looking up, the snow-capped mountain peak pierced through the swirling clouds, appearing and disappearing. The grey-white rugged layers of rocks on the mountainside transformed endlessly, with countless silver glaciers flowing for miles.
1:15:30|1:15:49|[Zhu Guangsheng] walked in the snow with his dog, taking one step at a time. The white snow healed his heart. Then he stood in the snow-covered stream, ready to pull Blue Wave out. However, he stumbled and fell down. After making sure Blue Wave was unharmed, he simply lay down, closed his eyes slowly. Blue Wave obediently stayed by his side.
1:15:49|1:16:4|Exhausted, [Zhu Cong] sat down in the snow, unable to move any further. She chose to compromise with [Zhang Biao], panting heavily due to severe physical exertion.
1:16:12|1:16:20|Changzi quickly moved behind Zhu Cong, while Zhang Biao watched quietly as Changzi untied the rope for Zhu Cong. Inside the car, Director Liu's phone rang.
1:16:26|1:16:43|They quickly headed to Zhu Guangsheng's home. At this moment, Zhu Guangsheng had already driven Zhu Lin and Lan Bo to search for Zhu Cong. Despite the muddy road ahead, he never stopped, and the angry Zhu Guangsheng furrowed his brow, saying helplessly,
1:16:56|1:17:8|Urgently turning the steering wheel, the car only came to a stop when it sank deep into the mud pit. On the other side, the three people who had crossed the mountain were slowly approaching a dilapidated cabin. Leading the way, [Zhang Biao] kept a close eye on the corner of the cabin.
1:17:8|1:17:32|Finally, he cautiously observed the surroundings. After confirming that there was no one around, he walked towards the raised ground in front of the cabin. He knelt down at the raised spot and used his hands to directly scrape away the accumulated snow on the surface. Soon, a wooden box was revealed on the ground. He urgently opened it, tearing off the paper covering to reveal a gun. [Zhu Cong] covered her mouth in shock, while [Zhang Biao] raised the gun and aimed at [Zhu Cong] and [Changzi].
1:17:48|1:17:56|Just then, snow started to fall at the place where [Zhu Guangsheng] had the accident. Snowflakes drifted down from the gray sky, gradually expanding.
1:17:56|1:18:7|The insignificant flurries turned into heavy snowflakes, creating a silent atmosphere. The car stuck in the mud kept flashing its hazard lights, while [Zhu Guangsheng] inside the car lay motionless on the steering wheel.
1:18:7|1:18:20|Sitting in the back row, Lanbo was unharmed. It rubbed the barely conscious Zhu Guangsheng back and forth with its mouth. Seeing that he still hadn't moved, Lanbo turned to rub against Zhu Lin, who was leaning against the seat. The semi-conscious Zhu Lin quickly woke up.
1:18:23|1:18:33|[Zhu Guangsheng] gradually woke up under the shaking of [Zhu Lin]. He slowly lifted his head, but blood kept flowing from the corner of his mouth. After saying that, [Zhu Lin] anxiously searched the pockets of his coat.
1:18:37|1:18:45|[Zhu Lin] took out a tissue to wipe the blood from Old Zhu's mouth, while Old Zhu turned his head and tried hard to move his body out of the car.
1:18:55|1:19:6|At this moment, [Zhu Guangsheng] in the car seemed to sense something? Barking incessantly, the old Zhu, who understood [Zhu Guangsheng]'s actions instantly, cautiously observed the surroundings. Following the barking, the old Zhu looked up and saw the silhouette of a wolf on the mountain.
1:19:8|1:19:14|He comforted [Zhu Lin] while observing the movements of the wolves, and the wolves on the hill had also noticed them in the car.
1:19:16|1:19:27|The wolf pack on the mountaintop quickly responded to their companions' calls and descended to surround Old Zhu's car from different directions. At this moment, Old Zhu inside the car was completely unaware of what was happening.
1:19:35|1:19:54|Old Zhu, who was gradually calming down, suddenly realized what was happening. After mentioning Old Zhou, he immediately started the car, and the dazzling headlights formed two beams of light. At the same time, the wolves' eyes were illuminated by the beams, instantly turning white. The wolf pack then began to retreat one by one, looking back reluctantly. However, due to their fear of the light, they had to give up and leave.
1:20:0|1:20:13|[Zhu Lin] bravely turned around in response to his father's encouragement and rolled down the car window. When Lao Zhu saw the window roll down through the rearview mirror, he turned his head and leaned back in his seat, watching [Lan Bo] panting in the back seat. He then said to [Lan Bo],
1:20:20|1:20:55|Old Zhu pinned all his hopes on [Blue Wave], gasping for breath from his severe injuries. At this moment, [Blue Wave] seemed to understand Old Zhu's words, responding with a whinny. Deep in trouble, Old Zhu could only try his luck. [Blue Wave] received the command to jump out of the window immediately. With his last bit of strength, Old Zhu shouted out, then threw his hat out of the window. [Blue Wave] leaped and caught it smoothly, following Old Zhu's instructions, running forward along the direction of the car lights, exerting all its efforts, never stopping.
1:20:56|1:21:8|When [Lan Bo] ran out of the danger zone, the car lights began to flicker, but the wolves did not leave. They watched as the car lights gradually disappeared, then stared at the car with a fierce look, and started a new action.
1:21:8|1:21:20|The wolf pack, under the leadership's call, is preparing to attack again. At this moment, Old Zhu is unprepared. The clever wolves change their strategy, silently crawling from behind the car. When the wolves start to pry open the car window,
1:21:25|1:21:46|[Zhu Lin] bravely rolled up the car window quickly and successfully blocked the wolves' attack. Seeing their failed attempt, the wolves halfway up the mountain quickly ran down to the car. The large group of wolves surrounded the van, and Director Liu from the forest station drove a police car quickly to Old Zhu's house. As soon as the car stopped, he got out and walked straight into the house.
1:21:52|1:22:4|At this moment, Lanbo carried the hat to the door. When Zhu Guangsheng's wife noticed it, Lanbo immediately turned and ran in another direction. It quickly ran to the door of the old buddy living in the dog yard, barking wildly, successfully waking up the old buddy.
1:22:5|1:22:12|As Zhu Guangsheng walked out of the room, he saw Lanbo barking wildly at him, and he noticed that all the dogs in the kennel had become agitated and aggressive.
1:22:13|1:22:31|He quickly ran towards the dog kennel with a flashlight, opening each cage at the fastest speed and releasing all the dogs inside. They ran out of the kennel one by one, following Lanbo to quickly support Lao Zhu. Meanwhile, Lao Zhu's wife and [Director Liu] drove around investigating Lao Zhu's whereabouts.
1:22:44|1:23:7|Worriedly nodding, the wife, trapped in the car, fearfully hides in Old Zhu's arms. At this moment, Old Zhu looks in horror at the wolves outside the car window, their mouths wide open as they roam around. Some eager wolves keep scratching at the windows. Director Liu immediately organizes the police officers to rescue people in the Grand Canyon. The convoy sets off immediately, heading to the destination at the fastest speed.
1:23:7|1:23:27|The sirens kept echoing on the mountain road as Blue Wave led his companions to take the nearest path. Their only goal at this moment was to rush to Zhu Guangsheng's side. However, suddenly, snow started falling from the densely clouded sky, but this did not affect the footsteps of the wolf dogs moving forward.
1:23:27|1:23:32|On the other side, [Zhang Biao] faced [Zhu Cong] and said, he lost his mind for love.
1:23:37|1:23:44|He stood in the center of Lover's Valley, looking sincerely at [Zhu Cong]. In his eyes at this moment, there was only the figure of [Zhu Cong].
1:24:6|1:24:12|Zhang Biao's words came from the bottom of his heart, Zhu Cong had never seen such a devoted man.
1:24:38|1:24:48|As he spoke, a smile appeared on [Zhang Biao]'s face. He quickly took the hunting rifle off his back, while [Changzi] and [Zhu Cong] were frightened and kept backing away.
1:24:55|1:25:3|Zhang Biao raised the gun above his head, but his phone suddenly rang. He immediately took off his gloves, took out the phone, and answered it as soon as he saw the display screen.
1:25:13|1:25:19|Zhang Biao moved his body, and at this moment, scenes of Zhu Guangsheng's wife carefully taking care of her mother in the hospital appeared in his mind.
1:25:27|1:25:42|Listening to his mother's words, Zhang Biao slowly put down his phone and watched as [Zhu Cong] also lowered the hunting rifle in his hand. Then [Zhu Guangsheng]'s wife called [Zhu Cong] in a hurry, asking for his exact location at the moment.
1:25:50|1:26:5|On the other side of the Wild Wolf Gully, [Zhu Lin], who was hiding behind [Zhu Lin], held a wrench in front of him. The wolves kept attacking the car, clawing at the window seams. As more and more wolves climbed up, [Zhu Guangsheng] tried to scare them off with the wrench, but they were not afraid and attacked even more fiercely.
1:26:6|1:26:29|Suddenly a wolf's claw reached into the driver's cabin, [Zhu Guangsheng] decisively used a dagger to cut the wolf's paw. The wolf howled in pain and then jumped out of the window. [Zhu Guangsheng] quickly rolled up the car window. At that moment, the wolf dogs finally crossed the mountain and arrived by [Zhu Guangsheng's] side. Sitting in the car, [Zhu Guangsheng] stared in astonishment at the approaching pack of wolf dogs.
1:26:29|1:26:46|He never expected that Lanbo would bring all his companions over. Lanbo, who was running at the front, headed straight towards him. At that moment, the leader of the wolves also noticed Lanbo. The leader stared at Lanbo, baring its sharp teeth and howling, as if conveying a message to its companions.
1:26:46|1:27:6|The wolf pack, upon receiving the message, turned around and looked around. Leading the way, Zhu Guangsheng rushed towards them without hesitation, followed closely by a large number of wolfhounds. After determining their direction, the wolf pack ran in groups towards them. The innate fierceness and pride of the wolves made them fearless of the wolfhounds in front of them.
1:27:6|1:27:17|The outstanding intelligence, patience, organization, and discipline of the wolf pack are fully demonstrated at this moment. In the dim night, the open mountain fields, and the tranquil forest, the sound of wolves and dogs fighting echoes everywhere.
1:27:17|1:27:39|In the car, [Zhu Guangsheng] tightly held [Zhu Lin] in his arms, covering her eyes with his hands, unable to let her see the cruel scene. Just then, a wolf ran up to the passenger side window, frightening [Zhu Lin] who immediately locked the window, keeping it out. However, the cunning wolf went around to the other side of the car, pried open the rear window, and reached its claws towards [Zhu Guangsheng].
1:27:39|1:27:48|Due to wearing thick clothes, only [Zhu Guangsheng], who managed to tear his jacket, narrowly escaped its sharp claws. Still shaken, [Zhu Guangsheng] quickly rolled up the car window and said,
1:27:52|1:28:3|The wolf, bitten hard by [Lan Bo] who received the order, caught [Zhu Guangsheng] with all its strength. [Zhu Guangsheng], whose attention was all on [Lan Bo], did not notice the wolf crouching by the window. The gunshot startled [Zhu Guangsheng], making him shiver.
1:28:13|1:28:21|[Zhang Biao] immediately aimed at the wolf pack with one shot each. Shocked, [Zhu Guangsheng] observed [Zhang Biao] through the rearview mirror, and soon all the wolves were shot dead by [Zhang Biao].
1:28:21|1:28:32|After experiencing a fierce battle, the scene was in a mess with bodies everywhere, wolves and dogs lying in pools of blood. Sitting in the car, [Zhu Guangsheng] looked at the scene at this moment, tears welling up in his eyes.
1:28:32|1:28:59|He never expected that this group of wolves would sacrifice themselves to save him. With a furrowed brow, he held back tears, unable to bear the sight of the wolves he had raised with his own hands. He deeply understood the unpredictability of life's journey and the pain of loss. Closing his eyes, he slowly lowered his head in prayer for them, burying his face in his arms, reluctant to lift it up, while also consumed by deep self-blame.
1:28:59|1:29:6|On the other side, [Zhu Guangsheng]'s wife stood by the window, constantly looking outside, while hoping for their safe return.
1:29:6|1:29:32|Director Liu's police car arrived shortly after, and they parked the car in an orderly manner where Zhu Guangsheng was. Concerned, Director Liu got out of the car as soon as it stopped and ran towards Zhu Guangsheng's direction. Other officers followed closely behind. However, Director Liu was shocked by the scene in front of Zhu Guangsheng's car. He looked at the bodies scattered all over the place and for a moment didn't know what to do. The only remaining few wolves kept howling at him.
1:29:32|1:29:54|Upon learning that the police were coming, [Zhang Biao] immediately turned his head to look at [Zhu Cong] and said, he suddenly smiled and winked at [Zhu Cong]. At this moment, [Zhu Cong] did not understand what he meant. After [Zhang Biao] finished speaking, he turned around and shouted at the police below the mountain. [Zhang Biao] raised his gun above his head and slowly walked down the hillside.
1:29:54|1:30:18|[Zhu Cong] and [Changzi] silently followed behind him. At this moment, [Zhu Guangsheng] raised his head in the car and sighed deeply, while Director Liu, standing in the crowd, immediately ordered the arrest of [Zhang Biao]. The law enforcement officers then walked cautiously towards [Zhang Biao] with their guns raised, handcuffing him with cold handcuffs. Witnessing all this, [Zhu Guangsheng] couldn't bear to watch and tightly closed his eyes as the law enforcement officers escorted [Zhang Biao] away.
1:30:18|1:30:32|He looked reluctantly at [Zhu Cong] beside him, and [Zhu Cong], who suddenly realized, finally understood what he had just said. She wanted to step forward to stop him, but hesitated. After getting off the car, [Zhu Guangsheng] first walked to the injured [Zhang Biao] and held him tightly in his arms.
1:31:44|1:31:56|At the same time, an eagle soared in the sky, overlooking the earth with powerful wings, soaring freely in the sky without constraints, as if time had gone back to the past.
1:31:56|1:32:9|[Zhu Guangsheng] stood on the hill shouting for Lanbo. Lanbo, who was playing in the snow, immediately ran towards him. The heavy snow was falling, connecting the sky and the ground, creating a vast expanse of white where it was impossible to distinguish between the sky and the ground.
1:32:9|1:32:25|Snowflakes fell from the sky, dancing in the air with the chilly wind. They fluttered like soft willow catkins or floating goose feathers in the vast expanse of the world.
1:32:25|1:32:36|Forestry worker [Zhu Guangsheng]'s shocked expression upon hearing the gunshot, his collapse in the snow clutching Blue Wave, and his tearful cry, just like his final monologue in the film, where in the end, there was nothing left.
1:32:36|1:32:53|[Zhu Guangsheng] is a general. In this battle, he defeated ten thousand enemies but lost eight thousand of his own troops. He lost his beloved general, his comrades, and what he had always wanted to protect. At this moment, his heart collapsed, and nothing could be more painful for a general than this.
1:32:53|1:33:5|Zhu Guangsheng is another ordinary and insignificant general. His emotions for this career are like his love for the snowy forest and these wolfhounds that follow him to the death.
