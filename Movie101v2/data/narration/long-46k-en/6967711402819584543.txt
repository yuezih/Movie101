0:4:28|0:4:37|After speaking, he turned his head and looked gently at [Xiao An], asking her. Hearing this, [Xiao An] silently answered her father with her eyes.
0:4:38|0:5:11|Soon the father stood up with his hands on his thighs and walked towards the room, followed by [Xiao An]. The father opened the door and led [Xiao An] into a room full of pipes. After [Xiao An] entered and the door was closed, she looked around the room with confusion. Then the father took her to another door and said, "Upon hearing her father's words, [Xiao An] took a deep breath."
0:5:11|0:5:27|Raising his right hand and placing it on the other hand held by the father and daughter, he said, then completely broke free with his left hand and walked away. The father immediately grabbed Xiao An's wrist and tried to pull her out, Xiao An felt that she had been deceived.
0:5:27|0:5:43|Upon hearing Xiao An's words, the father leaned back slightly, slowly released his grip on her wrist with his right hand. Xiao An clenched her left fist in mid-air, then touched the spot where her father had grabbed her with her right hand, swallowed hard, and quickly turned away.
0:5:45|0:5:56|The father watched as [Xiao An] insisted on returning to the side of the [Drug Dealer], staring fixedly in the direction she left, his body swaying slightly, lost in thought.
0:5:56|0:6:24|At this moment, the movie "Border Storm" officially begins. In the dark and quiet early morning, on the empty highway, a taxi is driving. On the other side of the highway, a sedan is also moving forward. At this moment, the taxi is unaware that it is being followed by the sedan. The taxi continues to drive leisurely. The sedan accelerates and rushes out of the intersection, quickly turning left to intercept the taxi before it reaches the intersection. Behind the taxi, a police car also blocks its way.
0:6:24|0:6:33|Then a young police officer got out of the sedan, aimed his pistol at the driver, knocked on the window of the driver's temple, and gestured for him to get out of the car.
0:6:36|0:6:53|The young Drug Enforcement Officer then opened the trunk and found suspicious decorations. He unscrewed the round head cover of the decoration and looked inside. He also found a key attached to the box. After pulling it off, he played with the key in his hand, furrowing his brow and falling into deep thought.
0:6:56|0:7:11|The scene shifts to a young Drug Enforcement Officer arriving at a busy gas station. He is trying to open the door of a large truck with a key, but after failing to do so, he decides to look for the next truck. He chooses to take a shortcut by bending down under one of the large trucks to search.
0:7:13|0:7:40|The young police officer was surrounded by two 20-meter-long trucks on the shortcut, so he could only walk and observe the next target. When he saw the new target, he was ready to take action. Before unlocking, he looked around, inserted the key, and surprisingly the door opened. Then he quickly grabbed the steering wheel and climbed into the driver's seat. After checking that there was no one in the car, he exited the driver's cabin and closed the door.
0:7:40|0:7:58|Then he circled around the front of the car and found something on the ground to the right rear of the passenger seat. He hurried forward to take a look, then bent down and glanced in the direction of the car's underside. After seeing the back of the car, he finally understood what was going on and walked towards his destination.
0:7:59|0:8:25|The young police officer walked into the repair shop and looked around, but didn't see anyone. However, in front of the rest area in the repair shop, he found a tire that seemed to have been repaired. To confirm his suspicion, he picked up a wrench and bent down to pry open the inside of the tire. At that moment, he felt someone approaching him.
0:8:27|0:8:34|Is he a truck driver? He threw the wrench on the ground and walked towards the other person, asking:
0:8:34|0:9:0|The man, with a towel in his hands, looked towards the police officer and said, "..." Upon hearing this, the police officer turned around, nodded at the man, and walked out. The man stopped rubbing his hands, closed his lips tightly, and walked into the rest area of the repair shop. The police officer, guided by the man, urgently searched in the gas station. He lifted the curtain and entered the convenience store of the gas station, then he stopped in his tracks.
0:9:0|0:9:15|He felt something was wrong, then slowly turned around to look at the convenience store's curtain and walked back to the auto repair shop. Once again at the auto repair shop, it was still empty, with no one around. However, the police did not pay attention to it and went straight into the lounge.
0:9:18|0:9:46|Next to the hot water heater in the lounge, there was a closed door. He looked through the frosted glass and saw that the light was on. After thinking for a moment, he slowly pushed open the door. As the door opened, the police officer stood there in shock. After taking a deep breath, he clenched his left fist and pounded on the door frame. On the ground lay the truck driver, with a large bloodstain underneath him. Two kittens were lying on top of him.
0:9:46|0:10:13|The scene shifts, the camera focuses on the man guiding the police at the auto repair shop, who unexpectedly appears at the Mong La station in Myanmar, sitting on a chair in front of the station with a stool as high as his calf beside him. At this moment, a man with a crew cut also carrying a similar box walks over, places his box on the chair, glances at the box by the feet of the man from the auto repair shop, and then walks away.
0:10:13|0:10:35|The man at the auto repair shop watched the other person leave and lowered his head. After receiving the new box, this man carried another box and turned into the rented place. At the doorstep, he put down the two boxes he was carrying, but did not rush to open the door. Instead, he stared straight at the door and then slowly lowered his head to look at the lock hole in the house.
0:10:36|0:10:43|After watching for a while, he lowered his head and looked down at his feet, but found nothing unusual.
0:10:45|0:11:3|He held his breath, gripping the sliding door outside the room, carefully pulling it to the right. It turned out that he had deliberately sprinkled sand in the door frame of the sliding door. As long as someone pulled the sliding door, the position of the sand would definitely change.
0:11:3|0:11:18|He carefully opened the quarter door, and then the man shifted his gaze to the keyhole. He took out a key and slowly inserted it, turned it twice, heard the lock click, and the door was pushed open.
0:11:18|0:11:43|Out of caution, the man did not enter immediately, but stood at the door watching. Then he bent down to pick up two boxes. Just as he took the first step, he seemed to suddenly remember something. He stopped, looked up to the top right, realizing the light bulb on the stairs was out, leaving only the fuse. After a moment of thought, he took a deep breath and turned his head.
0:11:43|0:11:49|Glancing towards the left light switch, he saw that it was off, so he decided to enter the room.
0:11:50|0:12:0|To prevent the sand under the sliding door from shifting too much, he walked in sideways, thus beginning the first chapter of the movie: Dog.
0:12:2|0:12:27|A large dog, reaching the knees of an adult woman, walked over with a smile on its face. Walking beside it was its female owner, who led it forward with light steps. [Niu Jieshi] was sawing a hollow pole with an electric saw, which looked similar to what [Policewoman Sister] found in the trunk. After sawing the pole, he sat at the table polishing the rounded end cap, then threw it into the cardboard box.
0:12:27|0:12:41|The Drug Dealer then wrapped the powdery substance in a small plastic bag, rolled it into a strip, picked up a round cap, stuffed the strip inside, pressed it hard with their thumb, sealed the cap tightly, and threw it into a box.
0:12:41|0:13:6|At night, the dog and [Policewoman Sister] passed through the corridor on their way home. The dog stopped in front of a door, and [Policewoman Sister] shouted at the dog. Although the dog, Fifi, was obedient, it still stared at the door. After hearing the call, Fifi ran towards the door of the house. While [Policewoman Sister] was opening the door, Fifi ran back to the door again to sniff the scent.
0:13:6|0:13:32|Later, the man from the auto repair shop inside the door stopped assembling and turned to look towards the door. Seeing Fēngfēng so excited, [Policewoman Sister] hurried over. After scolding Fēngfēng, he turned back. The man from the auto repair shop inside the door saw no movement outside the door, slowly turned his head towards the table, and found a very hidden camera outside his door.
0:13:32|0:13:55|From the monitor in the room, the man saw Fēngfēng and [Policewoman Sister] return to the room, but before [Policewoman Sister] entered, she looked towards the door, which made the man curious. However, he didn't get up, but continued to sit at the table assembling the decorations, screwing on one round head cap after another and throwing them into the box. The sound traveled through the wall to the adjacent restroom, inside the restroom.
0:13:55|0:14:25|Feng Feng heard a noise, raised his head straight towards the wall connecting the next room, seeing Feng Feng so concerned, [Policewoman Sister] with a face mask came to the wall, leaned her ear close to the wall, then looked down at her own Feng Feng, unable to resist her curiosity, [Policewoman Sister] opened the door, wearing slippers slowly walked towards the next room, halfway there, she took off her slippers and kicked them to the wall, then barefoot, tiptoed towards the next room.
0:14:26|0:14:47|Passing by the door next door, [Policewoman Sister] noticed a faint light shining through the window. Finally, she walked up to the door, looked around, and seeing no one, she slowly approached. With her hands on the sliding door, she pressed her ear against it. Suddenly, someone rushed over, and she quickly bent down and said,
0:14:49|0:15:2|Feng Feng sat in front of the door, with [Policewoman Sister] signaling it not to bark, then [Policewoman Sister] held her breath and pressed her ear against the door, but it seemed that no sound could be heard inside.
0:15:2|0:15:16|The door suddenly opened, and the man stood sternly at the doorway. He glanced down at his sister who took a step back, then looked at Fēngfēng at the door, and once again surveyed his sister up and down, before looking down at his feet.
0:15:16|0:15:50|The sister followed his gaze and looked down at her own feet. Her toes, without slippers, awkwardly curled up under the man's gaze. [Policewoman Sister] avoided eye contact, swallowed hard, and then heard: [Policewoman Sister] turned to look at where her shoes had just been taken off, then turned back to the serious and fierce man. After exhaling a breath, she looked at Feng Feng and said:
0:15:52|0:16:24|After asking this question, she dared not look up at the man's eyes. The man, after hearing it, lowered his head to glance at Fēngfēng, and replied, "I've heard it." [Policewoman Sister] awkwardly smiled, the man forcefully closed the door. [Policewoman Sister] bent over, pulling Fēngfēng along to run forward quickly, picking up the slipper kicked against the wall on the ground. The scene shifted, [Policewoman Sister] ran in from the door of the choir training room.
0:16:24|0:16:30|She put down her backpack and hurriedly walked through the first row, standing in the middle of the second row, looking at the script and singing.
0:18:8|0:18:17|The man from the auto repair shop walked out with the door half open, then headed towards the next door, which is the house of [Policewoman Sister].
0:18:20|0:18:40|He took out two iron wires at the door and inserted them into the keyhole to pry it open. Hearing the noise, Drug Dealer hurriedly ran out of the house. Then he deliberately did not lock the door of the neighboring house, where Gangster hiding on the other side of the corridor saw Drug Dealer running out and also went back home, closing the door behind him.
0:18:44|0:19:14|The man walked step by step towards the room where the Drug Dealer was. At this moment, the Drug Dealer was screaming wildly at the round hat placed on the table. The man then took out his gun and aimed it at the Drug Dealer, his expression cold and emotionless.
0:20:22|0:20:28|The young police officer shook hands with his colleague in greeting, then led the woman out from the inner room.
0:20:31|0:21:8|The camera zooms in, revealing that this woman is actually the Policewoman Sister. As she walks, she complains, but the moment the Policewoman hears it, she stops and glares back at her sister. The sister, realizing her mistake, quickly lowers her head and remains silent. She then turns to look at her brother, the Drug Enforcement Officer, who asks expressionlessly, while the sister with a visibly swollen face turns her head away.
0:21:8|0:21:12|After being scolded, the Policewoman Sister lowered her head with an unwilling expression.
0:21:22|0:21:33|As they were talking, the car turned into the street where [Policewoman Sister] lived. When the car stopped, the siblings didn't look at each other, but [Policewoman Sister] spoke first.
0:21:55|0:22:14|[Policewoman Sister] sighed and said again, "[Policewoman Sister]" frowned and looked at her brother, who was speaking while looking at [Policewoman Sister]. After giving him a glare, [Policewoman Sister] turned and said,
0:22:16|0:22:22|[Policewoman Sister] opens the car door, bends down and stands on the ground, holding onto the door, saying:
0:22:25|0:22:34|Closing the door, [Policewoman Sister] walked back home in a huff, while her brother remained silent, turning his head to the side and watching [Policewoman Sister] slowly enter the building.
0:22:36|0:22:44|Seeing that she had already entered, the [Policewoman Sister] expressionlessly lit a cigarette, then reversed the car out.
0:22:48|0:23:17|Upstairs, the [Gangster] assassin pulled back a corner of the curtain to secretly watch what had just happened downstairs. Meanwhile, [Policewoman Sister] walked while rummaging through her bag, searching for something. After searching for a while without success, she angrily shook her bag, scratched her head, searched through her bag again, and then took out her phone. Standing at the doorstep, she pressed a button on her phone, tilted her head, and placed the phone against her ear.
0:23:20|0:23:36|Hearing no response, [Policewoman Sister] hung up the phone and put it in her bag. She then called out towards the door tentatively. When she didn't get a response, she shouted loudly again.
0:23:45|0:23:50|[Policewoman Sister] was too focused on listening to the noise outside the door, completely unaware of the presence of the killer from the [Gangster].
0:23:57|0:24:28|Finally, the footsteps caught the attention of [Policewoman Sister]. She turned around and leaned against the door frame, watching the killer vigilantly. Then she heard him ask: [Policewoman Sister] listened, her eyes widening as she stared at the killer, her breathing becoming rapid. The killer gradually revealed his ferocious nature, looking at [Policewoman Sister] as if he wanted to devour her. The killer then started washing his hands.
0:24:28|0:24:52|After washing his hands and shaking them off, he grabbed a towel to dry them. Then, with a serious expression, he asked, but received no response. Placing the towel on the rack, he used a threatening look towards [Policewoman Sister]. [Policewoman Sister]'s hands were tied to the toilet pipe, and she said in a helpless tone: "My shoes were taken off and placed against the wall."
0:24:59|0:25:32|Brother walked into the corridor with the key in hand. As he approached the door, he slowed down, hearing footsteps. [Policewoman Sister] silently shed tears, panting softly. With her hands tied, she looked at the large bloodstains left by the crazy death. Inside the room, the killer was putting the finished round head cover into a cardboard box. After finishing, he closed the monitoring computer on the table, unplugged the power cord, apparently planning to escape.
0:25:32|0:25:57|Not seeing his [Policewoman Sister] outside the door, the brother went to the end of the corridor and seemed to have a telepathic connection with his sister. He stopped his steps to leave. His sister was also struggling to untie the rope binding her. The brother knocked hard on the door of his [Policewoman Sister]'s house, and the sound traveled from outside the door to the killer's bathroom.
0:27:9|0:27:35|He stood up and walked out of the bathroom, [Policewoman Sister] lay on the ground gasping in fear. Outside the door, the brother came out of [Policewoman Sister]'s house holding a phone, stopped in the hallway. Inside the room, the killer squatted in front of [Policewoman Sister] with a roll of plastic wrap, then started wrapping the plastic wrap from the top of [Policewoman Sister]'s head, layer by layer, covering her eyes, nose, and mouth.
0:27:41|0:27:50|After a while, the remaining plastic wrap gradually decreased, and the breathing of [Policewoman Sister], as well as the cries for help, also slowly weakened.
0:27:54|0:28:1|The assassin, entangled, stood up and watched as [Policewoman Sister] struggled, rubbing her feet on the ground.
0:28:3|0:28:29|Outside the house, the Drug Enforcement Officer tilted his head and held his phone, moving slowly from the house of the Policewoman Sister to the doorstep of the killer. Inside the house, the killer watched with enjoyment as the Policewoman Sister struggled on the ground. Driven by the instinct to survive, the Policewoman Sister, her face completely wrapped in plastic wrap, rubbed her elbows against the wall. The killer stood coldly on the side, expressionless, watching her persistent struggle.
0:28:30|0:28:48|In the bathtub, the crazy corpse seemed to be hinting at something. Even so, [Policewoman Sister] continued to move forward with her eyes and nose together. Suddenly, the screen went black, and the second chapter of the movie appeared, titled: Past Events.
0:28:53|0:29:18|In a simple decorated mahjong parlor, there are about a dozen men smoking. At this moment, a middle-aged [Drug Dealer] and a young [Drug Dealer] walk in from the first-floor corridor. The middle-aged [Drug Dealer] looks up at the building, looks around, and notices a not very crowded noodle shop on the second floor. Inside the noodle shop, the waitress is cleaning up the tables after the previous customers.
0:29:19|0:29:44|The scene then shifts, and across from the noodle shop, the elementary school student [Xiao An] comes out of the clinic with a backpack. His [Dentist] father is seen closing the clinic's shutter door behind him. At that moment, on the corridor railing, [Xiao An] notices the former young [Drug Dealer] turning in from the left. He is carrying a paper bag in his right hand, with his godfather following behind. The [Drug Dealer] stops after approaching the railing.
0:29:44|0:29:57|Then he turned and looked towards [Xiao An], who was also silently staring at the drug dealer who could be called uncle, the drug dealer and godfather slowly walked towards Xiao An.
0:29:58|0:30:36|Approaching Xiao An, the middle-aged and young Drug Dealers walked up from the escalator and turned left. At this moment, the Drug Dealer walked up to Xiao An and said, "Hearing what the Drug Dealer's godfather said," the Dentist stopped his steps to leave, turned around and stood in front of the godfather, saying, "The godfather opened his mouth, the Dentist carefully looked up and nodded, then the Dentist picked up the keys, unlocked the door, and pulled open the clinic's rolling shutter.
0:30:37|0:31:1|At this moment, the two middle-aged and young [Drug Dealers] sat down at the noodle shop diagonally across from the clinic, then ordered two bowls of noodles from the owner. On the clinic side, after the godfather went in, the [Drug Dealer] closed the glass door and locked it. But when he looked down, he realized that he had left [Xiao An] outside, looking at the bright big eyes that [Xiao An] raised.
0:31:1|0:31:9|The Drug Dealer ignored it and walked in. Inside the noodle shop, the middle-aged and young Drug Dealers started cracking melon seeds while waiting for their food.
0:31:11|0:31:28|They occasionally spit melon seeds on the ground, [Xiao An] was locked outside the door, could only hold onto the railing of the corridor with both hands, swinging her little feet boredly, while inside the room, her godfather was lying down following the instructions of the [Dentist] to have his tooth pulled.
0:31:31|0:31:38|At this moment, the two police officers disguised as Drug Dealers walked into the hallway on the first floor and slowly made their way towards the stairs to the second floor.
0:31:40|0:31:45|As the two of them gradually approached the stairs to the second floor, the camera slowly panned up.
0:31:47|0:32:8|This turned out to be a five-story indoor mini-mall, with a plastic roof on top letting sunlight shine through. [Xiao An] leaned on the railing, glanced at the plastic roof, then turned to look at the two police officers coming up the stairs, who also noticed the two police officers disguised as [Drug Dealers], as well as the [Drug Dealer] in the clinic.
0:32:11|0:32:32|Seeing two police officers approaching, the middle-aged and young [Drug Dealers] stopped eating rice noodles. The two police officers pulled out the chairs opposite them, sat down, took off their sunglasses, and then the middle-aged police officer asked,
0:32:38|0:33:10|The middle-aged Drug Enforcement Officer leaned back in his chair upon hearing this, staring at Xiao An across from him as she turned her head and walked towards the clinic. The Dentist thought Xiao An couldn't wait and that's why she knocked on the door. Seeing her father ignoring her, Xiao An walked back to the railing. The drug deal finally began at the noodle shop. Upon hearing the middle-aged Drug Dealer's question, the middle-aged Drug Enforcement Officer signaled to his teammate to bring it out.
0:33:10|0:33:37|The latter raised his hand and handed the bag on the ground to the middle-aged [Drug Dealer]. He unzipped the bag, checked the money he wanted, and the other three also silently watched. Seeing bundles of hundred-dollar bills inside, the middle-aged [Drug Dealer] signaled his assistant to take out the bag, then zipped up the bag filled with cash. On the police side, they opened the bag and started to act when they found bags of white powdery substance inside.
0:33:38|0:33:46|In an instant, the two were subdued. Seeing the situation, the Dentist quickly opened the door and pulled Xiao An back.
0:33:51|0:34:11|After locking the door, [Xiao An] was pushed into the small room in the clinic, then the Dentist continued to walk to the godfather's side to extract his tooth. The Drug Dealer looked through the door towards the middle-aged Drug Dealer squatting on the ground across from him, who spat out a mouthful of saliva and said with a smirk,
0:34:11|0:34:19|The middle-aged police officer immediately opened a packet, licked it with his index finger, and it turned out to be real flour.
0:34:21|0:34:26|Godfather finally finished pulling out the tooth, sat up and rinsed his mouth with a disposable paper cup next to him.
0:34:30|0:34:54|Outside the door, the police escorted two [Drug Dealers] down the stairs in front of the clinic. Before going downstairs, the middle-aged [Drug Dealer] glanced to the left in the direction of the clinic. The middle-aged [Police Officer] also noticed this, looked at the [Drug Dealer] and [Gangster] sitting inside, although puzzled, still went downstairs. Seeing this, the two people inside the clinic felt relieved, but halfway through the walk, ...
0:34:54|0:35:23|The middle-aged [Drug Enforcement Officer] stopped in his tracks, then returned to the second-floor staircase. Leaning against the railing, he surveyed the situation inside the clinic. After spitting out some saliva, the [Gangster] turned his head and saw the middle-aged [Drug Enforcement Officer] staring at him. He grinned and then turned his head towards the back, addressing the [Drug Dealer] behind him.
0:35:23|0:35:54|After finishing speaking, he turned around and lay down again. [Drug Dealer] heard it and lowered his head, pursed his lips, and looked at the paper bag by his feet. Then he bent over and stood up, carrying it into the suite. Seeing this, the [Drug Enforcement Officer] hurried forward. [Gangster] immediately took out a gun and shot towards the door, but the [Drug Enforcement Officer] dodged in time and was not hit.
0:35:54|0:36:6|The Drug Dealer in the suite discovered a door blocked by a cabinet, moved the cabinet aside and knocked on it hard. Then he went to the bathroom, took out the real drugs from a paper bag, and poured them into the toilet bowl bag by bag.
0:36:15|0:36:31|Outside the suite, a gunfight is taking place. The [Dentist] is hiding under the table, while the [Drug Enforcement Officer] smashes a glass bottle. Inside the suite, the [Drug Dealer] discovers [Xiao An] hiding in the corner and points a gun at her. Seeing the [Gangster] coming to reinforce, the [Policewoman Sister] quickly moves towards the suite and opens fire.
0:36:31|0:37:4|After three gunshots, [Godfather], with three holes in his heart, lungs, and abdomen, fell to the ground. The scene then shifts to the rooftop of the mall, where the glass is shattered. [Drug Dealer] carries [Xiao An], covering her mouth, out of the room and into one of the mall's floors. They forcefully kick open the door to the emergency exit and hastily look for a way to escape.
0:37:4|0:37:12|Seeing the police guarding ahead, he stopped, looked around, found a small alley, and quickly passed through the middle.
0:37:21|0:37:40|At the rooftop in the north, the [Drug Dealer] looked down and saw four [police officers] and a police car below. Then the [Drug Dealer] carried [Xiao An] and ran towards the other direction of the rooftop. They arrived at the rooftop in the west, where the [Drug Dealer] noticed a small garden below, connected to a building.
0:37:43|0:38:3|In the clinic, the middle-aged [Drug Enforcement Officer] dabbed some drugs from the toilet seat and took a sip. Suddenly, [Dentist] rushed in and found his daughter missing. Meanwhile, the [Drug Dealer] had successfully escaped from the mall and startled many dogs along the alley. The [Drug Enforcement Officer] quickly grabbed the rushing [Dentist].
0:38:6|0:38:33|The scene shifts, [Drug Dealer] has already brought [Xiao An] back to Myanmar. In a trembling shoulder in a forest, [Xiao An] is placed under a tree. Looking at [Xiao An] like this, [Drug Dealer] aims the gun at the other's hand, but hesitates to pull the trigger. In the end, he gives up, walks forward, touches [Xiao An]'s head, and then scratches his own forehead.
0:38:37|0:38:57|And so, the [Drug Dealer] carried on with [Xiao An], walking through the waist-high reeds. The scorching sun beat down on their heads, while the boatman by the riverbank was smoking under the blazing sun. Upon seeing what was happening on the shore, he held the cigarette in his mouth and quickly ran down from the boat.
0:38:57|0:39:31|The drug dealer had already carried Xiao An to the shore. The boatman quickly waded through the water, took Xiao An from the drug dealer, and then they approached the boat together. The boatman started the engine, and the drug dealer sat on the boat lost in deep thought. With the roar of the engine, the small boat was gradually heading towards the opposite bank of the river.
0:39:32|0:40:2|After getting off the small boat, the scene shows vast mountains and forests. In the forest, there is a narrow road with a car driving on it. Upon closer inspection, the front seats of the car are actually occupied by two Buddhist monks, while in the back, the convertible top is down. [Xiao An] is being fed water by a monk, sitting with her legs bent next to her. The [Drug Dealer] first looks at [Xiao An], then scans the surrounding trees.
0:40:6|0:40:10|The gate of the villa closed, and the [Drug Dealer] slowly led the now sober [Xiao An] inside.
0:40:11|0:40:41|In the villa, the son of the godfather squints at the two outside. When the [Drug Dealer] approaches, he kicks hard at the [Drug Dealer]'s chest. The [Drug Dealer] holds his chest and squats down, looking at him. Hearing this, the [Drug Dealer] slowly stands up, panting, and walks step by step towards the son of the godfather.
0:40:42|0:40:51|The camera now focuses on the dirt-covered face of [Xiao An], as the godfather's son points at [Xiao An] and asks the [Drug Dealer],
0:41:3|0:41:13|After hearing this, the Drug Enforcement Officer put down his gun. The Dentist took a men's leather shoe and put something inside the heel of the shoe.
0:41:15|0:41:44|After assembling the shoes, he tapped on the sole and found a bug. At the border checkpoint, the [Dentist] wearing these shoes appeared in the queue. After the inspector checked his passport and face, he stamped the pass on it. And so, the [Dentist] walked through the border checkpoint, step by step into the territory of Myanmar. At that moment, an off-road vehicle drove out from a small path in the farmland.
0:41:45|0:41:53|Seeing the Dentist walking towards him, the driver initially drove past him, then quickly reversed the car, using the rear end to block the Dentist's path.
0:41:55|0:42:24|The car door opened, and a man with a submachine gun got out of the car. He grabbed [Dentist], shoved him into the back seat, closed the door, and the driver quickly turned around and accelerated forward. They turned into a dirt road in a cornfield, leaving a trail of dust behind as the vehicle sped away. The car drove for a long time in the endless cornfield.
0:42:25|0:42:37|Crossing the cornfield, the car with [Dentist] inside arrived at the crowded town in Myanmar. Inside the car, seeing a submachine gun pointed at him, [Dentist] showed no fear.
0:42:37|0:43:8|In a dense forest, the car turned into a fork, and the godfather's son flipped through the newspaper, asking the [Dentist] standing behind him. Upon hearing this, the godfather's son stood up from his chair.
0:43:10|0:43:18|The Dentist was grabbed by the collar and threatened by the other party. At this moment, the Drug Dealer on the side discovered the secret in the Dentist's shoe sole.
0:43:32|0:44:2|He didn't make a fuss about the wiretap, instead he touched his ear again and pursed his lips. [Drug Dealer] drove forward with [Dentist] in the car, saying they arrived at a riverside. After parking the car, [Drug Dealer] got out of the car.
0:44:8|0:44:16|He knocked on the car window to signal the Dentist to come down with him, the Drug Dealer pushed the Dentist down and pulled out a gun.
0:44:19|0:44:37|After two gunshots, everything seemed to be back to normal. The clouds drifted slowly in the sky, and the air was filled with the summer heat. Suddenly, the [Drug Dealer] pressed a finger to his lips, shook his head at the [Dentist], and gently took off the Dentist's shoe containing a bug.
0:44:41|0:44:53|He grabbed the heel of the leather shoe with his left hand, pinched the toe of the shoe with his right hand, simulated the movement of dragging a body, and then threw the shoe into the river.
0:44:55|0:44:59|Then he opened the back door and took out a pair of slippers from inside.
0:45:2|0:45:28|Approaching [Dentist], throwing something at him, watching as he falls into a reverie. This was during the gunfight, when [Drug Dealer] was pouring drugs into the toilet to prevent the police from finding substantial evidence. He was frantically pouring drugs into the toilet, looking around and noticing that the ceiling seemed like a good hiding spot. So he emptied the dirty stuff from the trash bag in the bathroom.
0:45:28|0:45:40|Pouring the drugs that should have been flushed down the toilet into the garbage bag, one bag, two bags, three bags, and when the last packet of drugs was put in,
0:45:42|0:45:57|He quickly picked up a plastic bag, then stood up and wrapped the bag several times. After putting down the toilet seat cover, he stood on it himself, reached out and moved the board on the ceiling, and forcefully stuffed the plastic bag inside.
0:45:59|0:46:15|Then move the board back to its normal position, making everything look like the bags were placed back in order. The [Drug Dealer] immediately got off the toilet and wiped the footprints he left on it with his sleeve.
0:46:15|0:46:54|After flushing the toilet, the [Drug Dealer] pulled out a gun from his waist and walked towards the back alley, aiming to shoot. At that moment, [Xiao An] was discovered at this time and place. Seeing the innocent [Xiao An], the [Drug Dealer] hesitated to pull the trigger. Meanwhile, [Xiao An] sat obediently against the wall. The scene shifted, ending the flashback. The [Drug Dealer] and the [Dentist] arrived at the riverside.
0:47:1|0:47:26|The Drug Dealer watched as the Dentist proposed a deal, but the latter ignored him and left on a boat. In the clinic's restroom, the Dentist looked up at the ceiling, then slowly stood on the toilet seat, pushed hard to poke open a panel in the ceiling, and moved it bit by bit.
0:47:27|0:47:43|At night, outside the first floor of the mall, [Dentist] sneaked out with something in his arms. The corridor outside the building was quite long, so he jogged a few steps. After passing through one of the corridors, he quickened his pace.
0:47:45|0:48:10|Suddenly a beam of light shone on his face, illuminating his entire front, and thus [Dentist] was handcuffed and escorted to the middle-aged police officer. By the riverside at night, [Xiao An] was wearing the clothes of the [Drug Dealer] and gazing into the distance with him.
0:48:12|0:48:41|The Drug Dealer cracked an egg into the frying pan, looking over at Xiao An sitting at the dining table. He blinked at her, then turned back to the frying pan. Letting out a heavy sigh, the Drug Dealer sat at the table while Xiao An continued to gulp down her porridge, glancing up at the Drug Dealer on her left.
0:50:22|0:50:34|Pulling down a thick towel and walking into the corridor, [Drug Dealer] wraps the towel around his right hand as he walks. After the driver of [Drug Dealer] comes down the base stairs, he sits on the stairs and puts on his shoes, while the monks continue chanting, not much different from usual.
0:50:34|0:51:0|The door opened, [Drug Dealer] entered the godson's room, the latter was sleeping under the blanket. Outside the villa, the little henchmen were gathering towards the base room. [Drug Dealer] approached the godson and watched as the latter woke up groggily and raised his right hand. On the other side, all the little henchmen entered the base room. [Drug Dealer]'s men locked the door and killed the guard, while [Drug Dealer] also shot the godson in the forehead, causing him to lie on the bed face up.
0:51:2|0:51:19|The father and son both died like this. The [Drug Dealer] held a funeral for them in the temple. During the funeral, the [Drug Dealer] knelt devoutly between the portraits of the two, clasped his hands together and bowed his head. After the final bow, he did not bend down again, but stared straight ahead.
0:51:19|0:51:25|With the sound of gunfire, the [Drug Dealer] fell to his knees, and then a monk hung an amulet around his neck.
0:51:42|0:52:13|The chanting by the monk has ended, marking the moment when [Drug Dealer] officially becomes the boss. Meanwhile, the driver of [Drug Dealer] carries a submachine gun through the base. After becoming the boss, [Drug Dealer] kowtows in front of the Buddha hall. Inside the base, the henchmen of the father and son are lying crookedly on the table, lying on the ground. At the bottom of the room made of wooden boards, blood drips like thick porridge from the cracks. The day breaks.
0:52:13|0:52:48|The wind blew through the branches of the base, making a rustling sound. The driver drove to the temple to pick up the [Drug Dealer]. After sleeping for a while in the car, he opened his eyes. From then on, [Xiao An] and the [Drug Dealer] officially lived together. Time passed, [Xiao An] grew up and became the wife of the [Drug Dealer]. The two walked out of the room hand in hand. The scene shifted back to the bridge over the river where it all began.
0:52:50|0:52:57|While Xiao An was staring at the river, the voice of the Dentist came from off-screen.
0:52:57|0:53:24|The person they initially went to see was the [Dentist], because the [Dentist] was finally released from prison. At this moment, [Xiao An] had her hands folded in front of her, she turned around and looked towards the driver's seat of the car standing behind her on the right. She slowly lowered her head, while the [Drug Dealer] sat quietly in the driver's seat staring ahead, ignoring [Xiao An]'s gaze. The scene then returned to the father and daughter arguing.
0:53:24|0:53:35|The Dentist stood in the cabin and reminisced, while Xiao An sat on a chair and looked towards her father, saying,
0:54:22|0:55:4|After saying that, [Xiao An] no longer looked towards her father. Upon hearing these words, her father immediately turned his head towards [Xiao An] and paused for a moment before speaking: With tears in her eyes, [Xiao An] looked at her father, pursed her lips, lowered her head, and then slowly looked into the distance. She pleaded softly to her father: Without looking at her father this time, [Xiao An] trembled, her dry lips quivering, furrowed her brow, and stared straight ahead, suggesting to her father:
0:55:5|0:55:11|The screen goes black, and the film transitions to Chapter Three: Daughter. In a small school in Myanmar, [Xiao An] sits beside a piano.
0:55:16|0:55:55|[Xiao An] played the piano while watching the children below, with a slight smile on her lips from time to time. Back at home in the bathroom, [Xiao An] held a pregnancy test in her hand, with two lines indicating that she was going to be a mother. However, she didn't seem too happy about it. On the other side, the drug manufacturer wearing a mask separated the drugs with a sieve, carefully shaking them into the weighing pan. After picking up a large bag of drugs,
0:55:55|0:56:9|The [Drug Dealer] used scissors to cut open, sprinkled into the tray, then extended his index finger and used a knife to make a cut, fresh blood immediately gushed out. After it gushed out, he hung the wound over the tray, letting the blood drip into it.
0:56:44|0:57:8|Suddenly, a side of the classroom collapsed, with the doors and windows falling to the ground. The air was filled with choking dust from the collapsed building. Half of the classroom collapsed, and [Xiao An], with a cut on her forehead, crawled out from the crevice. Upon hearing cries for help, she pulled a child out from under a desk and quickly ran to the side, shouting, "Don't panic, don't be afraid."
0:57:12|0:57:21|After picking up a little girl from the ground, [Xiao An] ran out with another child. Not long after they ran, the remaining houses all collapsed.
0:57:28|0:57:42|The doctor told [Xiao An], who had a broken foot, that there was no life-threatening danger and asked her not to worry. After urging the doctor to go busy himself, she rode her small motorcycle, dragging the crutch given by the doctor, and hurriedly left the hospital. As the motorcycle accelerated forward, [Xiao An]'s left hand, which had already been bandaged, kept twisting the handle to speed up.
0:57:44|0:57:51|Listening to Xiao An's accusations, the Drug Dealer came to the hospital and looked thoughtfully at the child lying on the hospital bed.
0:57:52|0:57:56|Some of them had their entire heads wrapped up, while others were still hooked up to IV drips.
0:58:2|0:58:14|Outside the door, upon hearing the doctor's words, the [Drug Dealer] quickly turned to look at him, then glanced back at the children on the sickbed. The [Drug Dealer] asked where the parents of the children were, and they replied that they were on their way.
0:58:15|0:58:46|Upon hearing this, the [Drug Dealer] lowered his head to look at the ground, then took a deep breath and asked if there was any help needed. The [Dentist] replied that drugs were needed. Immediately, he turned and walked towards the car parked outside, ordering his men waiting there to go to China to buy drugs. Afterwards, the [Drug Dealer] quickly bypassed the front of the car and got in. The car drove through dense trees, the glass reflecting the surroundings, making it hard to see the [Drug Dealer]'s expression. He forgot how much money he had spent on building the house.
0:58:52|0:59:4|[Drug Dealer] asked again how much was used, the latter still refused to say, [Drug Dealer] pulled out a gun and asked again, the latter answered fifty thousand, [Drug Dealer] asked again, the latter said less than thirty thousand.
0:59:4|0:59:23|The irritable [Drug Dealer] grabbed the opponent's short hair with his hands, pulled his collar, and punched his stomach repeatedly. [Drug Dealer] fired four shots, each shot going from his stomach to his back. Finally, the expression on [Drug Dealer]'s face inside the car could be clearly seen this time.
0:59:24|0:59:44|In the car, every bump in the road caused the [Drug Dealer] to squint his eyes. After four shots pierced through the man in the cap, the [Drug Dealer] looked at the completely collapsed classroom, then lowered his head to look at the wound on his index finger that had been cut earlier, pinching the band-aid on top of it.
1:0:39|1:0:43|The driver looked at the [Drug Dealer] leaning against the front of the car and said indifferently,
1:0:44|1:1:8|The Drug Dealer glanced back, the driver next to him eating an apple blinked, then turned back to look towards the classroom, lips tightly closed, not saying a word, but he had made up his mind. The scene shifted to the Mengxiu Station where the Gangster hitman was waiting. After the Drug Dealer's driver put down his own box, he picked up the hitman's box and walked away.
1:1:10|1:1:25|The driver stopped, without looking back, said: After speaking, he continued to carry the box forward. The driver squinted and did not answer. The scene switched, the driver was on the phone, turned back and gestured to the other party not to wait.
1:1:29|1:1:43|In the daytime, a car was driving unsteadily through the woods, with a man and a woman lying on the back of the convertible. Two henchmen were pointing submachine guns at them.
1:1:43|1:2:2|In the front seat of the car is the driver of the [Drug Dealer], who is driving while occasionally looking back. The [Drug Dealer] is in a waist-deep pit, using a shovel to dig up soil. Beside the pit are henchmen pointing guns at him and [Xiao An] with her hands tied behind her back.
1:2:2|1:2:33|Seeing the new boss approaching the pit, the [Drug Dealer] dropped the shovel, blinked his swollen eyes, and begged for mercy for [Xiao An]. After glancing at [Xiao An], the [Drug Dealer] slowly knelt in the pit, then once again pleaded with the new boss. Upon hearing the order to come up, the [Drug Dealer] prepared to climb up by holding onto the edge of the pit. Just as he touched the edge, the new boss kicked him back into the pit. The [Drug Dealer] turned around again.
1:2:36|1:2:56|[Xiao An] saw it and knelt by the pit, looking at [Drug Dealer] with heartache. [Drug Dealer] didn't give up, stood up at the bottom of the pit, turned around with difficulty, with long bloodstains left on his head and in his nostrils. Facing the new boss once again, [Drug Dealer] grabbed his pants leg, still begging him to spare [Xiao An].
1:2:58|1:3:12|The driver looked down at the [Drug Dealer] on the side, who once again clung to the new boss's leg begging for mercy. Seeing the [Drug Dealer] persisting like this, the driver stepped forward and kicked his head hard. The [Drug Dealer] still tried to crawl forward, but eventually ran out of strength and fell backwards.
1:3:12|1:3:28|Seeing the [Drug Dealer] like this, [Xiao An] shed tears, then staggered to her feet. She took a deep breath, took a few steps forward, and then squatted down to jump into the pit.
1:3:28|1:3:38|She looked down at the Drug Dealer, Xiao An turned to the new boss and said, then quickly lay down on the left side of the Drug Dealer, resting her head on his shoulder.
1:3:39|1:3:47|At this moment, the driver picked up a shovel and, with both eyes tightly closed, began to throw soil into the pit, shovel by shovel.
1:3:52|1:4:24|Earth was thrown from four directions, gradually covering the chests, waists, and faces of the couple, burying them alive. Coincidentally, the female student who had previously given apples to the [Drug Dealer] witnessed this scene. She quietly ran back home, where an elderly person was preparing herbal medicine, accompanied by the prayers of the hostess. The couple, with their eyes tightly closed, were placed on the ground.
1:4:24|1:4:42|The old man kept mixing medicine, while the hostess kept praying loudly, hoping that this kind-hearted couple could recover. The female student sat cross-legged next to them, with her hands clasped together, hoping that they were not seriously injured.
1:4:42|1:4:53|In the early morning by the river, the boatman is anxiously waiting. Seeing a few people coming to the river bank, he quickly runs towards his small boat and starts the engine.
1:4:53|1:5:26|The drug dealer and the student family arrived on the river bank. The drug dealer patted the student's head, helped Xiao An onto the small boat, and as the engine noise faded, the three of them sailed towards the other side under the cover of night. After getting off the boat, Xiao An and the drug dealer went to her father's house and knocked on the door. When her father opened the door and saw Xiao An, he then noticed the drug dealer behind her.
1:5:26|1:5:51|After being seen by her father dressed shabbily with the [Drug Dealer], [Xiao An] lowered her head. Her father took a step back, half turned his body, blinked his eyes, then slowly turned the other half of his body, leaning against the door frame at an angle. This was her father's tacit approval. [Xiao An] quickly looked at the [Drug Dealer], who immediately pulled her inside.
1:5:51|1:6:27|Soon after, the father also followed in and closed the door. Now we come to the fourth chapter of the film: Past Events. In a dimly lit room, there is a man in a vest sitting at a table by the window, eating. After a while, he picks up a beer from the table and takes a sip. The phone rings.
1:6:32|1:7:5|He walked towards the vibrating phone with a beer cup in hand, it turned out to be the [Gangster] hitman. The [Drug Dealer] shouted at the hitman on the phone, and the hitman raised the phone to answer: After the [Drug Dealer] finished speaking, he hung up the phone. [Xiao An] stared straight at him in the living room, [Drug Dealer] remained silent, just standing there. On the other end, after the call was hung up, the hitman also quietly looked at the phone in his hand.
1:7:6|1:7:37|At this moment, we are back to the beginning when the little dog Fifi and [Policewoman Sister] first appeared, one person and one dog, slowly walking towards home from the corridor. Then it was Fifi staring at the next door in the bathroom, followed by [Policewoman Sister] and the police brother arguing before going home. Finally, [Policewoman Sister] with both hands tied to a water pipe, her face wrapped in plastic wrap, struggling frantically in the assassin's bathroom.
1:7:38|1:7:53|Due to difficulty in breathing, [Policewoman Sister] retched, then she shook her head from side to side and moved her body up and down, hoping to get out of the current situation. However, it was just too difficult. Unable to bear it, [Policewoman Sister] cried.
1:7:54|1:8:21|At this moment, the police brother walked out of the house of [Policewoman Sister] holding a phone, while the assassin in the bathroom watched [Policewoman Sister] struggle. Outside the door, the brother saw through the open window of the assassin's house the round head cover he had found, looked around and then extended his index and middle fingers to retrieve a round head cover from the window. In the process of taking it out, he accidentally knocked over something else, catching the attention of the assassin.
1:8:23|1:8:52|The killer held his breath, tiptoed out of the bathroom, crossed the corridor, peeked his head out, saw the fallen round condom from the window in the room, immediately realized someone outside the door, looked towards the window, turned off the light, outside the door, the brother saw the light go out, turned his head to look into the window, the killer immediately stepped back, suddenly, the brother noticed the ceiling outside the door,
1:8:52|1:9:24|Only the top of the killer's house had a light on, while the lights in other houses were off. Then, the brother had a rough plan in mind. Inside the house, the killer slowly moved backwards and pulled out a gun from behind his waist. Outside, the brother carefully approached the killer's door through the window. However, when he was just one step away from the door, he stopped and drew his gun.
1:9:25|1:9:31|He then kicked off his leather shoes, stood with both feet on the ground, and slowly bent down at the waist.
1:9:45|1:10:15|The Drug Dealer had just placed his leather shoes one by one in front of the door. The hitman then fired a shot through the peephole on the door, seeing his brother lying on the ground. He then turned back into the room, picked up two boxes, walked to the door, and opened it. As the door opened, he saw the two leather shoes on the ground. His brother was leaning against the right side of the door, aiming at the hitman's temple. The brother quickly ran into the bathroom.
1:10:16|1:10:30|Seeing [Policewoman Sister] wrapped in plastic wrap, her brother immediately knelt down and tore them open in circles. [Policewoman Sister] lay on the ground, finally able to breathe freely, and cried out in frustration.
1:10:30|1:10:46|After tearing off the plastic wrap, the brother worked hard to untie the rope bound in the hands of [Policewoman Sister] above the water pipe, and then the siblings slowly embraced each other.
1:10:48|1:10:57|In the interrogation room of the Police Sister Bureau, the killer and the brother sat facing each other, one on the left and one on the right.
1:11:2|1:11:15|Later, the brother pushed the phone in front of the killer, who picked it up and pressed a few buttons. The [Drug Dealer] asked:
1:11:34|1:12:1|[Drug Dealer] held up his phone in the living room and answered, "After saying that, he hung up the phone. In the interrogation room, the two people sitting face to face stared at each other without speaking. At this moment in the choir rehearsal hall, [Policewoman Sister] was lying on the ground looking under the stage, then she stood up and clapped her hands, ready to pull open one of the stages."
1:12:4|1:12:20|The door of the rehearsal room suddenly opened, and [Policewoman Sister] walked in. She glanced at it and was about to continue moving the stage. With a little effort, she stepped up and looked down. [Policewoman Sister] said sadly:
1:12:31|1:12:37|Saying that, the [Policewoman Sister] casually opened a stage and stood on it, looking through the crack.
1:12:40|1:12:48|Moving back to the original position after not finding anything, the next stage is pulled down. Inside, [Policewoman Sister] says:
1:12:53|1:13:34|After moving the stage back to its original position, the brother walked around and stared at the ground. He took a step back and opened up the stage, then picked up something from the ground. The brother threw the item into the hands of [Policewoman Sister], who looked up at him and smiled. After listening, [Policewoman Sister] lowered her head and asked, looking at the brother's hand with a sideways glance.
1:13:37|1:13:56|After the brother put the stage back in place and prepared to leave, [Policewoman Sister] called out to her brother who was about to leave. After speaking, [Policewoman Sister] no longer looked directly at her brother, but instead rubbed her fingers together, waiting for her brother's answer. The brother walked over and sat down beside her.
1:14:58|1:15:38|Upon hearing this, [Policewoman Sister] turned her head back and let out a self-deprecating sigh. When her brother noticed and turned to look at her again, she met his gaze, then lowered her head. Her brother tilted his head, took a deep breath, and after speaking, he chuckled softly. Hearing the laughter, [Policewoman Sister] glanced at him and also smiled, then said,
1:15:39|1:15:56|Brother stood up with his hands on his thighs and quickly left. [Policewoman Sister] watched as the siblings met for the first time without arguing, pursed her lips and cried softly. The lights were bright on the airport runway as brother arrived at his destination for a business trip.
1:16:25|1:16:52|[Police] raised a toast to her brother, wishing him well. Her brother lay in the clinic, hearing the request from [Dentist], he sat up. After rinsing his mouth, he wiped his mouth and turned to ask, [Dentist] turned around with washed hands and said:
1:17:4|1:17:11|The Dentist stopped washing his hands, turned around to look at his brother, who was sitting in the clinic staring straight at him.
1:17:12|1:17:20|In a sudden turn of events, in a restaurant, the killer is slurping noodles. Across from him, his brother also has a bowl of noodles.
1:17:21|1:17:35|The older brother just watched as the killer wolfed down his food without picking up his chopsticks. The killer glanced at him and said, "Brother," as he looked at the killer chewing on noodles and then turned to his colleagues at the other table.
1:17:39|1:18:15|At night, the killer in handcuffs in the prison dialed the phone and said, "When I heard the words 'noodle shop', the [Drug Dealer] widened his eyes instantly, recalling his experience from over a decade ago. Then he spoke: "After listening, the killer put down the phone from his ear, hung up, and handed it to his brother."
1:18:17|1:18:35|The latter sighed and the [Drug Dealer] on the other side of the living room also hung up the phone and gasped for a long time. The next day in front of Mengxiu Station, after looking around the surroundings, the brother walked out of an old building two stories high.
1:18:37|1:18:54|After walking down the short slope, he turned to the right of the old building and found a door blocked by iron bars. He shook it hard, causing one side of the bars to open, then pushed open the other side with force, and slowly walked in.
1:18:54|1:19:22|He walked inside while surveying the rundown house, stopped and turned around in place, noticing a door panel welded onto the window. Opening the panel, sunlight streamed in, revealing the potatoes in the packaging bags on the floor. The scene then shifted to the earlier conversation between the brother and the Dentist at the clinic, where they identified each other.
1:19:22|1:19:45|Without saying a word, on the other side, in the bedroom, the [Drug Dealer] and [Xiao An] sat side by side. The [Dentist], after his brother left, closed his legs and placed his hands on his knees, staring blankly at the floor. In the bedroom, as the [Drug Dealer] got up from the chair to leave, seeing him preparing to go out, [Xiao An], who was originally sitting beside him, spoke up:
