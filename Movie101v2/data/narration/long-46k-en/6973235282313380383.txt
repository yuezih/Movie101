0:6:43|0:7:12|The film starts with a scene showing a mobile phone, with the screen displaying a call to [Yan Shouyi]. The scene then shifts to [Yan Shouyi]'s home, where his wife [Yu Wenjuan] is mopping the floor by the doorway. [Yan Shouyi]'s phone is placed on the shoe cabinet, and suddenly it starts ringing. Upon hearing the sound, [Yu Wenjuan] puts down the mop, wipes the sweat off her face, and walks over.
0:7:13|0:7:18|She answered the phone, and a voice of impatience came from the other end,
0:7:24|0:7:44|As soon as the call ended, the other party hung up. [Yu Wenjuan] slowly put down her phone and looked thoughtfully at the screen. A car was driving and stopped in front of a toll station. Sitting in the passenger seat, [Fei Mo] said to [Yan Shouyi]:
0:8:6|0:8:10|The two of them drove forward in silence, heading towards the toll booth.
0:8:26|0:8:38|[Yan Shouyi] thought for a moment and then started the car to continue driving. But after a few steps, [Yan Shouyi] felt uneasy again. He parked the car on the side of the road, put his hand on the steering wheel, and said after some contemplation:
0:9:7|0:9:23|It was drizzling lightly in the sky. [Yan Shouyi] drove back home, parked the car downstairs, and entered the house cautiously. Looking around, he closed the door and walked straight to the shoe cabinet.
0:9:24|0:9:36|He glanced at his phone and saw that [Wu Yue] had called, his face immediately showing a hint of unease. He then put the phone in his pocket and walked into the house.
0:9:43|0:10:6|[Yan Shouyi] deliberately pretended not to know, turned around, took out his phone and glanced at it, saying: "Once [Yan Shouyi] opened the door and went out, [Yu Wenjuan] stood still in place without moving. The scene then shifted to the studio of a talk show, where the lights gradually brightened from dim to bright."
0:12:31|0:12:36|Shen Xue snatched Yan Shouyi's phone and threw it into the trash can.
0:12:44|0:12:56|Shen Xue looked at [Yan Shouyi] in silence, then threw the pen heavily on the table, saying nothing as she walked towards the door.
0:13:5|0:13:11|Everyone stood up and left their seats. Someone in the classroom couldn't bear it anymore and said to [Yan Shouyi]:
0:13:16|0:13:38|[Yan Shouyi] lowered his head in embarrassment upon hearing this, leaving only [Yan Shouyi] in the classroom for a moment. [Shen Xue]'s coat was placed on the front seat, and [Shen Xue] walked angrily towards the platform to tidy up the teaching materials. [Yan Shouyi] stood up and walked over, whispering to [Shen Xue]:
0:14:1|0:14:19|[Yan Shouyi] stuffed [Shen Xue]'s coat and inspection together into [Shen Xue]'s hands. At night, beside the road, there was [Yan Shouyi]'s car parked in a small grove, with [Yan Shouyi] and Wu Yue inside.
0:14:19|0:14:39|In the dim light, with occasional passing cars beside, [Yan Shouyi] held some clothes in his hand, looking anxious as he lifted himself up from the seat, saying, "Wuyue's arm slipped off his shoulder." He looked at the passing vehicles outside the car window, feeling uneasy as he wiped his mouth and turned to look at Wuyue, saying:
0:14:58|0:15:9|Wu Yue bit onto Yan Shouyi's back.
0:15:17|0:15:43|Wu Yue stopped, suddenly pulled out the car key, threw it outside, closed the door and looked at [Yan Shouyi] with a twisted face. [Yan Shouyi] looked at her helplessly without saying a word. Wu Yue tidied her hair in the car, so [Yan Shouyi] had to get out of the car to find the key. At this moment, the phone suddenly rang, [Yan Shouyi] had to answer the call, and Wu Yue pushed open the car door and walked out.
0:16:29|0:16:43|The scene shifts to the home of [Yan Shouyi], where Yu Wenjuan is sitting on the sofa, soaking her feet and watching TV. The phone rings. She picks it up.
0:17:51|0:17:57|Yu Wenjuan hung up the phone, dialed [Yan Shouyi]'s number, and a dial tone came from the other end of the line.
0:18:2|0:18:12|Yu Wenjuan held the phone thoughtfully. The scene shifted to [Fei Mo] and his wife walking their dogs in the neighborhood, with their dog entangled with the neighbor's dog.
0:18:36|0:19:13|Fei Mo's smile froze on his face, looking serious. Yu Wenjuan suddenly stood up, walked out of the foot bath with wet feet, went to the balcony to look outside, and then walked restlessly in the room. On the other side, Fei Mo, worried about Yan Shouyi, called him. At that moment, Yan Shouyi was driving home, holding the steering wheel with his left hand, picking up his phone with his right hand, opening it, then opening the car window and sunroof for ventilation. The cold wind blew in instantly.
0:19:13|0:19:33|[Yan Shouyi] shivered from the cold, quickly flipping the hood of his coat up over his head. He then picked up his phone, dialed a number, glanced ahead, and placed the phone on the seat next to him. At that moment, Wu Yue's voice came through the phone.
0:19:54|0:20:12|He hung up the phone with a smile, and the scene shifted to outside his house. He reversed the car into the parking space, parked it properly, but at this moment he still didn't know that his lie had been exposed, still didn't know that his wife at home had started to suspect him. He pushed open the car door, ready to get out, when suddenly he remembered something.
0:20:12|0:20:41|Back in the car, he looked around, closed the door, took out his phone and deleted the call records with Wu Yue. Then, [Yan Shouyi] pushed open the door of the corridor and walked in. He stopped again, looked nervously towards the house, hesitated for a moment, reached out to unzip his jacket, lowered his head and stuck his head inside the jacket, carefully sniffed. His eyes moved slightly, then he calmed down.
0:20:43|0:20:51|Returning home, [Yan Shouyi] pushed the door open and walked in, closing the door behind him. He went straight to the shoe cabinet, changing his shoes while looking around the room.
0:20:53|0:21:2|Yu Wenjuan asked him calmly when she heard the noise in the room.
0:21:11|0:21:26|Yu Wenjuan sat on the sofa watching [Yan Shouyi]. She turned off the TV and stood up, walking towards [Yan Shouyi]. He was lying on the bed wearing a coat. When he saw his wife, he immediately got up. Yu Wenjuan approached and hugged him, saying:
0:21:57|0:22:7|[Yan Shouyi] looked at his wife in a daze,
0:22:18|0:22:27|Yu Wenjuan stubbornly reached out her hand, making [Yan Shouyi] feel guilty. Yu Wenjuan started to get impatient, but still pretended to calmly hand the phone to his wife.
0:22:37|0:22:44|Yu Wenjuan hung up the phone, staring at [Yan Shouyi], who remained silent and looked away. Just then, the phone rang again.
0:22:45|0:23:19|Yu Wenjuan opened her phone, and Wu Yue sent a message saying: "Don't take off your bra when you sleep." Yu Wenjuan slowly raised her head, [Yan Shouyi] avoided her gaze. Yu Wenjuan handed the phone to [Yan Shouyi] for him to read it himself. [Yan Shouyi] closed the phone without saying a word. He glanced at Yu Wenjuan and then lowered his head. Reluctantly, he shifted his body and slowly walked towards the sofa.
0:23:19|0:23:25|He took off his T-shirt and Wenjuan, holding back tears, walked towards him.
0:23:26|0:23:48|[Yan Shouyi] threw the clothes he took off onto the sofa, glanced back at his wife. At this moment, [Yan Shouyi] was left with only a short-sleeved shirt on him. He slowly pulled out the hem of his shirt tucked in his pants, like a child who had done something wrong. His wife watched him from behind.
0:23:48|0:24:2|[Yan Shouyi] stripped himself clean, standing motionless with his upper body bare. Yu Wenjuan looked at [Yan Shouyi]'s shoulder, her eyes turning red instantly as she saw the teeth marks left by Wuyue's bite.
0:24:3|0:24:8|Even though she had already guessed the outcome, Yan Shouyi could not face the reality at this moment.
0:24:9|0:24:15|She cried with her head down leaning on [Yan Shouyi]'s shoulder, then covered her eyes and left, [Yan Shouyi] got divorced.
0:25:0|0:25:15|After the short training session, everyone took a group photo together. Amidst the laughter and chatter, a train slowly passed by. [Yan Shouyi], [Shen Xue], and [Fei Mo] sat inside the train, chatting away.
0:26:53|0:27:2|[Shen Xue] glanced at [Yan Shouyi], who smiled without saying a word and turned his head towards the window.
0:27:22|0:27:34|[Fei Mo] paused for a moment and slowly said:
0:28:4|0:28:20|Brick Brother put the money into his jacket pocket while talking, when suddenly his phone rang. He took out the phone and pulled out the antenna, leaving [Yan Shouyi] looking at the brick brother with an incredulous expression.
0:30:57|0:31:1|[Shen Xue] took the wine glass from the waiter, frowned, and took a sip.
0:31:23|0:31:31|[Shen Xue] drinks it all in one gulp, lowering her head and grimacing.
0:32:18|0:32:54|Shen Xue collapsed on the chair, while Yan Shouyi was eating noodles next to her. In the evening, a room was lit up, and grandma slowly opened a ring box, revealing a jade ring inside. Yan Shouyi nodded while sitting across from her, but dared not to look up. Grandma, getting angry, spoke in a more serious tone and placed the ring in front of Yan Shouyi, saying:
0:32:58|0:33:23|Grandma choked up a bit, [Yan Shouyi] nodded incessantly. Grandma slowly picked up the cane beside her and looked at [Yan Shouyi]. She extended the cane towards [Yan Shouyi]'s chest, her voice trembling. [Yan Shouyi] was poked down onto the kang by Grandma's cane. Then he slowly got up and buried his head deeper. The village was quiet at night, with a few farmhouse lights flickering.
0:34:50|0:35:14|At this moment, the phone next to [Fei Mo] rang again. [Yan Shouyi] took the notebook from his colleague and sat next to [Fei Mo]. After the female colleague finished the call and returned, [Yan Shouyi] gestured for her to sit across from them.
0:35:28|0:35:45|[Fei Mo] had a gloomy look and showed displeasure, [Yan Shouyi] joked when he saw it:
0:36:25|0:36:36|[Yan Shouyi] grabbed [Fei Mo], who was angry and trying to get up, and pushed him back onto the sofa.
0:38:17|0:38:30|[Yan Shouyi] looked outside and turned to [Wu Yue], saying, "[Wu Yue] wiped the water from washing her hands on [Yan Shouyi]'s pants."
0:38:46|0:39:0|[Wu Yue] stood up and [Yan Shouyi] also stood up. He walked to the door and said to the outside: He casually closed the door, returned to his original position and sat down.
0:39:39|0:39:46|The scene shifts, two female students walk through the dormitory corridor laughing and joking,
0:39:53|0:40:21|Upon seeing [Shen Xue], the two immediately quieted down and returned to the dormitory. [Shen Xue] held a flashlight to inspect the dormitory, pushed open a door, and walked in. She used the flashlight to check each bed, all of which were empty. Finally, she found a girl on the top bunk, illuminated by the flashlight. The girl woke up, rubbed her eyes sleepily, and struggled to open them due to the bright light. [Shen Xue] stood on the ground with a stern face and asked:
0:41:12|0:41:39|Suddenly, [Yan Shouyi] turned off the light, excitedly pulled [Shen Xue], and then moved two chairs under the window. The two of them stood on the chairs and looked out the window. They saw a car drive to the school gate and stop. A group of girls giggled as they got out of the car, chatting away while putting on their coats. One girl ran to the gate to check the situation first.
0:41:39|0:41:56|Arriving at the school gate only to find it was already late, the rest of them were still dawdling to tidy up their clothes. In the dark night with heavy snowfall, everyone was in chaos. They discussed and decided to start climbing over the wall to enter.
0:42:7|0:42:28|The students who were caught stood in a row, hanging their heads. [Shen Xue] walked back and forth, not saying a word, using her presence to suppress the students. She slowly approached a girl who backed away in a hurry upon seeing her, quickly glancing at [Shen Xue]. [Shen Xue] lowered her head, sniffed, and said:
0:42:30|0:42:40|The girl lowered her head and dared not answer. At this moment, Yan Shouyi's phone rang,
0:42:42|0:42:56|Upon hearing the words from the person opposite, [Yan Shouyi] was shocked, he slowly squatted on the ground, widened his eyes, showing an expression of disbelief. In the pitch-black room, [Yan Shouyi]'s face was illuminated by the faint light from the phone.
0:42:56|0:43:3|He fell silent for a moment, then calmly asked: The scene shifts, with [Yan Shouyi] and [Fei Mo] playing with a baby,
0:43:34|0:43:41|Yan Shouyi's attention has been on the baby all along, and finally he speaks:
0:43:44|0:43:50|After he finished speaking, he bent down and kissed the child. In the hospital room, [Fei Mo]'s wife Li Yan was chatting with Yu Wenjuan.
0:43:59|0:44:8|[Fei Mo] pulled over a chair and sat down, gesturing quietly to [Yan Shouyi] to sit down. Li Yan took out a thermos from the side and placed it on the table.
0:44:16|0:44:27|Yu Wenjuan weakly shook her head to refuse. [Yan Shouyi]'s expression was not very natural, while [Fei Mo] cleared his throat.
0:44:52|0:45:25|[Fei Mo] and his wife smiled to themselves, while Yu Wenjuan remained silent. [Yan Shouyi] picked up his briefcase and unzipped it, searching for a while before pulling out a ring. He stood up and handed the ring to Yu Wenjuan, who refused to take it. [Yan Shouyi] had no choice but to place the ring on the table. He then took out a phone box from the bag and set the briefcase aside.
0:45:25|0:45:28|He opened the phone box and handed it to [Yu Wenjuan].
0:45:41|0:46:6|Li Yan looked at [Yan Shouyi], then looked at [Fei Mo] with a pleading look. [Fei Mo] helplessly lowered his eyes to indicate his inability to help. Lin Yan had to take the phone away, and the atmosphere suddenly dropped to freezing point. [Yan Shouyi] sat down, [Fei Mo] coughed, about to speak, when suddenly [Yan Shouyi]'s phone rang. [Fei Mo] looked embarrassed as [Yan Shouyi] answered the phone, it was a call from [Shen Xue].
0:46:48|0:46:54|[Shen Xue] led the bride and groom to toast the guests,
0:48:17|0:48:22|While speaking, [Yan Shouyi] walked into the bedroom and lay on the bed face up.
0:48:33|0:49:7|[Yan Shouyi] fell into a deep sleep and woke up lying on the bed. He opened his sleepy eyes and saw [Shen Xue] tidying up his bag. Closing his eyes, [Yan Shouyi] frowned and sighed in annoyance. "Yan Shouyi" immediately woke up, sat up, looked around, thought for a while, then collapsed back on the bed, saying:
0:49:15|0:49:34|After saying this, [Shen Xue] suddenly realized something, paused her actions, looked at the women's phone on the bed, and stared at [Yan Shouyi] with a suspicious look. She stood up, took the phone, and walked to the head of the bed. She looked down at [Yan Shouyi] from top to bottom and questioned:
0:49:40|0:49:56|[Yan Shouyi] lay on the bed without saying a word, [Shen Xue] threw the phone next to [Yan Shouyi]. After washing his face and coming out of the bathroom, [Yan Shouyi] stood there holding a towel, looking at the angry [Shen Xue] who was sitting on a chair far away with her back towards him.
0:50:46|0:51:7|Shen Xue sobbed as she yelled at Yan Shouyi, who was momentarily stunned. Yan Shouyi pretended to be innocent as he explained. Shen Xue's tears welled up in her eyes, making Yan Shouyi flustered and unable to look at her, so he could only lower his head and stare at the towel in his hand. Yu Wenjuan was about to be discharged from the hospital.
0:51:7|0:51:23|[Yan Shouyi] paced back and forth at the hospital entrance. Yu Wenjuan came out holding a child, followed by her brother carrying bags. [Yan Shouyi] immediately opened the car door for them, but Yu Wenjuan walked straight ahead without even looking.
0:51:34|0:51:49|Yan Shouyi's brother ran forward with a suitcase, and at this moment a taxi stopped at the intersection. Yan Shouyi closed his own car door, stood in place, and watched as they got into the taxi.
0:52:5|0:52:13|A small boat docked at the pier, with [Wu Yue] wearing a hat and sunglasses. Behind [Wu Yue] was a woman, both carrying bags as they got off the boat. [Wu Yue] said:
0:52:26|0:52:49|[Wu Yue] brought a girl to a house, pushed the door and walked in. [Wu Yue] sat cross-legged on the bed in the inner room, boredly watching TV. The woman who came with him sat at the table outside staring at the computer. [Wu Yue] changed several channels until he saw [Yan Shouyi]'s program stop.
0:54:8|0:54:14|The scene shifts to Yan Shouyi, Fei Mo, and Shen Xue, who are having foot baths.
0:54:59|0:55:11|[Yan Shouyi]'s phone rang, he took it out of his pocket and checked the message. It was from Wu Yue. Yan Shouyi was stunned for a moment, then focused and read Wu Yue's message: "You can deceive me, but I can't deceive you."
0:55:15|0:55:29|I'm in Qingdao, in that same room. You mentioned the green long flow, nonsense. At this moment, [Shen Xue] seemed to sense something, picked up her body and started drinking tea. [Yan Shouyi] glanced at [Shen Xue], then immediately deleted the text message from Wu Yue.
0:55:34|0:55:49|[Yan Shouyi] finally relaxed and put away his phone. He glanced over at [Shen Xue] and saw her looking at him while sipping tea. He awkwardly said:
0:56:4|0:56:21|[Yan Shouyi] glared at [Fei Mo] with displeasure. [Fei Mo] smiled but said nothing. He then glanced at [Shen Xue] and realized she hadn't heard, which put him at ease. Just as [Yan Shouyi] closed his eyes, his phone vibrated in his pocket. He noticed it but pretended not to, while [Fei Mo] also heard and turned to look at him.
0:56:31|0:56:41|He opened his phone, glanced at it, pressed the reject call button, and then put it to his ear.
0:56:51|0:57:8|Returning home, [Yan Shouyi] flipped through a newspaper on the coffee table in the living room. He then rolled up his sleeves and walked towards the dining room where a stack of newspapers was placed on the table. He continued to search through them and then asked in confusion:
0:57:58|0:58:33|Upon entering the restroom, [Yan Shouyi] immediately closed the door, placed the newspaper on the toilet, and sat down. He took out his phone and glanced surreptitiously outside the door. Putting the phone to his ear, he whispered, " [Shen Xue] suddenly pushed the door open and walked towards the mirror, where she saw [Yan Shouyi] reflected. Startled, she turned around and asked:
0:58:38|0:59:8|[Yan Shouyi] stood up in a panic, dropping his phone on the ground. [Shen Xue] coldly asked, [Yan Shouyi] didn't know how to respond for a moment, he looked down at the phone on the ground. [Shen Xue] walked over and picked up the phone, [Yan Shouyi] fidgeted unnaturally. [Shen Xue] looked at the phone screen in confusion and said, [Yan Shouyi] twisted the toilet handle to cover up his guilt. The two of them went to the living room and sat apart. [Yan Shouyi] covered his face with his hands.
0:59:30|0:59:46|[Yan Shouyi] got up and walked towards [Shen Xue], sitting down beside her. With a smile in his eyes, he looked at [Shen Xue] and said:
1:0:42|1:1:10|The scene shifts, [Yan Shouyi] parks the car on the side of the road, he gets out of the car, followed by a woman from the back seat. The woman, carrying a large backpack, obediently follows behind [Yan Shouyi]. [Yan Shouyi] turns around and says: At this moment, Yu Wenjuan's brother comes out from the door. [Yan Shouyi] says: Yu Wenjuan's brother cautiously glances behind him.
1:1:41|1:1:48|[Yan Shouyi] nodded thoughtfully as Yu Wenjuan's brother took out a photo and said:
1:2:22|1:2:30|[Yan Shouyi] lowered his head to eat something, then looked up at [Wu Yue] and said:
1:2:35|1:2:49|[Wu Yue] finished speaking with a serious face, then started eating. At this moment, [Yan Shouyi]'s phone rang. He glanced down at it and said to [Wu Yue], "Yan Shouyi is answering the phone." [Wu Yue] stared at him intently.
1:2:59|1:3:20|[Wu Yue] lowered her head to continue eating. Upon hearing the words, [Wu Yue] suddenly looked up at [Yan Shouyi], hung up the phone. [Yan Shouyi] lowered his head to eat, and the two remained silent. [Wu Yue] frowned and said:
1:3:40|1:3:51|[Wu Yue] put down the knife and fork, looked up at him in disbelief, [Yan Shouyi] lowered his head, avoiding [Wu Yue]'s gaze, [Wu Yue] stared at him [Yan Shouyi] without a word, he looked up at [Wu Yue],
1:3:56|1:4:4|Wu Yue stubbornly looked at Yan Shouyi, who remained unmoved. At this moment, Shen Xue walked in and looked around.
1:4:49|1:4:55|Wu Yue rubbed Yan Shouyi's foot under the table.
1:4:56|1:5:4|Watching the sweet interaction between the two, [Shen Xue]'s expression became unnatural, but she still politely smiled. After dinner, it was already dark outside.
1:5:4|1:5:15|[Yan Shouyi] is driving on the road, with [Shen Xue] sitting in the passenger seat. Both of them are silent, [Shen Xue] looking serious and [Yan Shouyi] appearing bewildered.
1:5:15|1:5:22|Yan Shouyi's eyes wandered as he pondered how to speak up. After a while, he reached out and touched the clothes bought by Shen Xue, saying:
1:5:45|1:6:8|The two fell silent again, [Yan Shouyi] driving nervously, while [Shen Xue] was brewing emotions. Suddenly, she raised her voice and said, "Yan Shouyi's lie has been exposed, and he doesn't know how to respond." [Shen Xue] looked ahead with a sense of grievance, and [Yan Shouyi] had no choice but to tell the truth.
1:6:50|1:7:4|[Yan Shouyi] knew he was in the wrong, but still lost his temper. [Shen Xue] softened her tone, leaned on [Yan Shouyi]'s shoulder, and started acting coquettish.
1:7:15|1:7:24|[Yan Shouyi] kissed [Shen Xue]'s forehead, and the two reconciled. The scene shifted to [Niu Caiyun], the daughter of Lv Guihua, sitting in [Yan Shouyi]'s home.
1:8:25|1:8:37|[Yan Shouyi] turned to [Niu Caiyun] and said, [Yan Shouyi] remained silent, turned around and continued watching TV.
1:8:37|1:9:6|The next day, [Yan Shouyi] was driving around looking for a parking spot. Not far ahead, [Fei Mo] got out of the passenger side of a car, with a young woman who shouted at him. [Fei Mo] turned around, and the woman opened an umbrella and kissed him on the cheek. [Fei Mo] smiled and was about to leave. [Yan Shouyi] in the car observed everything, as [Fei Mo] left with the umbrella. [Yan Shouyi] parked the car next to the woman.
1:9:6|1:9:32|The woman in the car had her phone number written below, and as she drove away, [Yan Shouyi] took out his phone to call [Fei Mo]. [Fei Mo], holding a lady's umbrella, struggled to take out his phone. [Yan Shouyi] teased: [Fei Mo] turned his head and looked around.
1:11:12|1:11:28|[Yan Shouyi] took out a photo from his pocket and handed it to [Fei Mo]. [Fei Mo] took it and saw a photo of Yu Wenjuan holding a child. He sighed and handed the photo back with a smile. However, [Yan Shouyi] said:
1:11:39|1:11:48|[Fei Mo] nodded knowingly and put away the photo.
1:11:59|1:12:7|A reader handed a book to [Fei Mo] for an autograph, and [Fei Mo] quickly signed it with a pen before returning the book to the reader.
1:12:26|1:12:47|Another reader came to ask for [Fei Mo]'s autograph. [Yan Shouyi] opened his phone to check the message, it was from Wu Yue, saying: "I want to see your physical performance, bite you." After reading it, [Yan Shouyi] was stunned, immediately turned around to search for Wu Yue's figure. At this moment, Wu Yue was wearing a cheongsam, with her hair pinned up, holding a wine glass.
1:12:47|1:12:55|She pretended to casually glance at [Yan Shouyi] over her shoulder, then continued to elegantly drink wine, covering her mouth and chatting with the guests.
1:12:55|1:13:13|After three rounds of drinks, Wu Yue woke up in the restroom. She put a towel on her face in front of the mirror, but suddenly her phone rang. She hurriedly dropped the towel, fumbled for her phone in her bag, and, overwhelmed by alcohol, swayed her body. She had no choice but to lean on the sink. She picked up her phone to check the message.
1:13:13|1:13:21|It's a text message from [Yan Shouyi], he said: "Stop messing around, my enemy." Wu Yue held the phone, leaned on the sink and laughed.
1:13:22|1:13:32|She then picked up her phone and sent a text message to [Yan Shouyi], the content of the message was: Room 518.
1:13:40|1:13:59|The drama school is recruiting students, with [Shen Xue] as one of the examiners. Niu Caiyun walked out from among more than ten candidates, handed the registration form to the chief examiner, glanced at [Shen Xue], then walked to the middle of the classroom. The candidates behind him were all giggling, and [Shen Xue] and Teacher Su were also amused.
1:14:12|1:14:25|Niu Caiyun immediately turned around and walked quickly towards the classroom door after listening. She opened the door and walked out, closing it heavily. After a while of silence, the examinees all looked towards the door. Teacher Su and [Shen Xue] exchanged a glance, and the chief examiner said:
1:15:8|1:15:36|The elevator doors closed, [Yan Shouyi] pressed the button for the fifth floor, he opened his phone to read Wu Yue's message, then deleted it. Leaning against the wall, the elevator soon stopped on the fifth floor. He walked out of the elevator, paused in the hallway, looked around, found the room sign on the wall, and walked slowly with his hands behind his back. As he reached the corridor, he looked inside and saw no one.
1:15:36|1:15:59|He carefully looked around, making sure no one was there, before sitting down on a chair at the corridor entrance. He took off the flower on his suit and put it in his pocket, glancing around anxiously. He fidgeted on the chair uneasily, suddenly remembering something.
1:15:59|1:16:14|Perhaps worried that someone might call, or perhaps feeling guilty, the phone was still on, so he took out the battery. After some manipulation, he finally stood up and walked in confidently.
1:16:14|1:16:30|[Shen Xue] walks in the hallway of the teaching building, looking around for Niu Caiyun. The hallway is filled with exam candidates nervously preparing for the exam. [Shen Xue] walks out of the teaching building, and the campus is also crowded with people. She quickly passes through the crowd and finally finds Niu Caiyun.
1:16:30|1:16:38|Niu Caiyun sat on a stone bench, chatting with several candidates. [Shen Xue] quickened her pace and walked over angrily, saying to Niu Caiyun:
1:17:17|1:17:26|Shen Xue turned and walked away, leaving Niu Caiyun looking puzzled. In a hotel room, shelves were filled with Fei Mo's books, and the voices of a man and a woman could be heard from a phone.
1:18:0|1:18:10|Wu Yue sat on the edge of the bed, pressed the pause button on her phone, and turned to look at [Yan Shouyi] lying on the bed.
1:18:42|1:19:22|[Yan Shouyi] stared at Wu Yue and turned his body, saying, "You haven't finished speaking." Suddenly, [Yan Shouyi] agilely sat up, and Wu Yue said word by word. [Yan Shouyi] looked at Wu Yue in shock, the two of them fell into silence. Wu Yue turned back with a look of unwillingness. [Yan Shouyi] sighed helplessly, rubbed his eyes, and slowly said:
1:19:37|1:20:3|[Yan Shouyi] widened his eyes and turned to look at Wu Yue. Tears streamed down Wu Yue's face as she sobbed uncontrollably. [Yan Shouyi] stood there in a daze, unable to speak, and eventually chose to avoid the situation. He slowly lay back on the bed, staring at the ceiling in silence.
1:20:3|1:20:9|[Shen Xue] and [Yan Shouyi] are preparing to send [Niu Caiyun] back to her hometown. The platform at the train station is bustling with people coming and going.
1:20:26|1:20:31|Shen Xue's phone rang, and she answered the call, asking:
1:21:28|1:21:34|At this moment, [Shen Xue] is looking out of the train window searching for [Niu Caiyun], [Yan Shouyi] hands the phone to [Shen Xue] and says:
1:21:43|1:21:58|[Yan Shouyi] paced uneasily, waved goodbye to [Niu Caiyun] over his shoulder. After finishing the call, [Shen Xue] turned around to look at [Yan Shouyi], sighed and said:
1:22:21|1:22:40|[Yan Shouyi] remained silent, lowered his head. [Shen Xue] and [Yan Shouyi] arrived at [Fei Mo]'s home. [Fei Mo] sat dejectedly on the sofa, the table piled with writing materials and calligraphy works. [Li Yan] picked up a cigarette at the desk, crying as she lit it. His face was haggard, unkempt, smoking with red, swollen eyes, and sobbing miserably.
1:23:3|1:23:7|[Li Yan] stood up and walked towards [Fei Mo] with the room key.
1:23:41|1:24:3|[Fei Mo] sat hunched over on the sofa, hands clasped together, closing his eyes in despair. [Yan Shouyi] found a box of tissues and walked towards [Fei Mo]. [Fei Mo] remained motionless on the sofa like a child who had done something wrong. [Yan Shouyi] sat down next to [Fei Mo], handing him the tissues. After staring blankly for a while, [Fei Mo] glanced at [Yan Shouyi].
1:24:4|1:24:10|Wiping his face with a tissue, [Yan Shouyi] stepped past him and picked up the room key on the sofa.
1:24:10|1:24:42|He opened the room card and saw the name [Fei Mo] on it. [Fei Mo] said sorrowfully, "[Yan Shouyi]." [Yan Shouyi] turned to look at [Fei Mo], who lowered his head, furrowed his brows, and showed a helpless expression. He slowly turned his head to glance at [Yan Shouyi], sighed, and suddenly heard the sound of the door closing. Both of them looked towards the inner room. [Yan Shouyi] turned around, and [Fei Mo] said:
1:25:10|1:25:17|[Fei Mo] cried bitterly, furrowing his brows tightly, tears welling up in his eyes. He shook his head and said to himself:
1:25:29|1:25:46|[Yan Shouyi] stared at the room key without saying a word, quietly listening to [Fei Mo]'s confession. [Fei Mo] slowly said, [Yan Shouyi] turned his head in confusion to look at [Fei Mo], and [Fei Mo] also turned to explain to [Yan Shouyi]:
1:26:11|1:26:24|[Fei Mo] suddenly stopped, [Yan Shouyi] glanced at [Fei Mo]. [Fei Mo] moved slowly, weakly took out his phone from his pocket, handed it to [Yan Shouyi] without looking at him, and shook his hand absentmindedly.
1:26:32|1:26:45|[Fei Mo] said a few words and then turned his head to the side, sighing to himself. [Yan Shouyi] glanced at the inner room, then turned to look at [Fei Mo]. Seeing the sad expression on [Fei Mo]'s face, [Yan Shouyi] didn't know what to say.
1:26:47|1:26:56|Back at home, [Yan Shouyi] is searching for something under the table. [Shen Xue] takes the photo of Yu Wenjuan holding a child and slams it heavily on the table.
1:28:30|1:28:40|[Yan Shouyi] walked towards the door, immediately turned back upon hearing the words. He angrily took out his phone from his pocket.
1:28:44|1:28:58|[Yan Shouyi] angrily stormed out, and soon he came back out with a bag, then slammed the door shut. [Shen Xue] sat still in her place, while [Yan Shouyi] stood on the stage in the broadcasting studio recording the program.
1:29:40|1:30:5|The audience burst into laughter as [Yan Shouyi] turned to the side and took out the script to read. The band on the side started playing to lighten the mood, but [Yan Shouyi] looked at the script with a dejected expression and seemed distracted. He appeared to be out of focus, and after a while, he sighed and turned to the musicians, saying, "Stop the band."
1:30:6|1:30:29|Turning around, [Yan Shouyi] calmed down and looked at the script seriously. The audience and crew patiently waited for him. He then folded the paper and put it in his pocket, raised his head, nodded to the cameraman, and said, "Facing the camera, [Yan Shouyi] took a deep breath and gave a big smile."
1:30:32|1:30:57|The scene shifts to the home of [Yan Shouyi]. The phone suddenly rings in the room, the camera scans past rows of photo albums on the bedroom table. The phone continues to ring as the camera follows the sound, moving forward to the living room doorway. The phone keeps ringing, but no one answers.
1:30:57|1:31:18|At this moment, [Shen Xue] was nowhere to be found. The room was empty, and the camera moved forward from the dining room to the living room. The phone was still ringing. As the camera reached the doorway, [Yan Shouyi]'s phone was seen on the shoe cabinet, its screen flashing with the ringing, as if something important was happening.
1:31:18|1:31:23|At this moment, [Shen Xue] and Li Yan are in the process of moving to the service hall to handle their business.
1:31:34|1:31:41|They walked out of the lobby's main door, each holding a one to two-meter long call log.
1:32:12|1:32:31|Hearing Li Yan's words, [Shen Xue] took out her phone from her pocket, holding a call log sheet in one hand and dialing a number. Li Yan anxiously watched as Shen Xue finished dialing the number and placed the phone on the dial key. After hesitating for a moment, Shen Xue closed the phone and turned to Li Yan, saying:
1:32:36|1:33:3|Back home, [Shen Xue] heard the phone ringing as soon as she opened the door. She turned around and saw that it was [Yan Shouyi]'s phone on the shoe cabinet. The phone kept ringing, and when he picked it up, the screen displayed the name Yu Wenjuan. After a moment of thought, she put the phone back on the shoe cabinet. The phone continued to ring, but [Shen Xue] remained unfazed. As she walked towards the sofa to put down her bag, [Yan Shouyi]'s phone rang twice again, this time with a text message.
1:33:3|1:33:9|[Shen Xue] put down her bag and walked over to check her phone for messages. As she looked at it, she suddenly froze in place.
1:33:9|1:33:25|The sunlight outside the window cast her shadow on the wall. She slowly lifted her head and stood still, lost in thought. The message on her phone was hard for her to accept at first. Then she paced back and forth on the floor, muttering to herself while looking at her phone.
1:33:29|1:34:2|Shen Xue picked up her phone, pacing back and forth in thought. Yan Shouyi was on his way home when the red light came on. His car stopped at the intersection, and he sat in silence, staring blankly with a heavy heart as if he had lost his soul. When the green light came on, the vehicles at the intersection started moving one by one, passing by Yan Shouyi, who was completely absorbed in his own world, indifferent to his surroundings.
1:34:2|1:34:10|Causing a traffic jam without realizing it, he glanced ahead and only then realized he had lost focus, quickly driving forward.
1:34:13|1:34:29|[Shen Xue] sat at the table, the room pitch black. He lit match after match, yet didn't light the candle on the table, letting the matches burn in his hand, the flickering flames casting shadows on his face. Suddenly, the door swung open.
1:34:29|1:34:45|[Yan Shouyi] stood at the door, watching [Shen Xue] motionless. However, [Shen Xue] showed no reaction, staring blankly at the matches in her hand. [Yan Shouyi] turned on the table lamp by the door, then closed the door. [Shen Xue] held a lit match in her hand, but suddenly let it go.
1:34:45|1:35:8|The match fell into the ashtray and went out. She lit another match. [Yan Shouyi] slowly walked over, stopped next to [Shen Xue], who was staring at the flame in her hand without saying a word. [Shen Xue] weakly said, "..." [Yan Shouyi] was stunned, he looked down and saw his phone on the table.
1:35:8|1:35:25|He reached out to grab the phone, opened it with a serious expression, and saw a text message from Wu Yue: "I want to see [Shen Xue], you figure it out." Also in sight was a photo of [Yan Shouyi] and Wu Yue, in which Wu Yue was shirtless and kissing [Yan Shouyi].
1:35:26|1:35:43|[Yan Shouyi] folded his phone, calmed down for a moment, the light outside the window flickered and changed, illuminating the dark room. [Yan Shouyi] slowly walked forward, sat across from [Shen Xue], who was silently playing with matches in her hand.
1:35:54|1:36:1|[Yan Shouyi] still didn't get any response, he lowered his head and dared not look at [Shen Xue], nervously shifting his body.
1:36:11|1:36:43|[Yan Shouyi] confessed everything. [Shen Xue] lit another match, as [Yan Shouyi] continued: The match in [Shen Xue]'s hand gradually went out, [Yan Shouyi] said self-deprecatingly: [Yan Shouyi] finished speaking and buried his head even lower.
1:36:48|1:37:4|[Yan Shouyi] laid everything out, but [Shen Xue] still refused to speak. Just then, a call from Yu Wenjuan came in. [Yan Shouyi] glanced at it and immediately became nervous, quickly moving to the side to answer.
1:37:5|1:37:15|[Shen Xue] was still lighting the match, she finally picked up the match and was ready to light it. [Shen Xue] lit the match,
1:37:15|1:37:29|With a vacant look, like a puppet, [Yan Shouyi] stood by the window, his tone gradually becoming heavy. [Yan Shouyi] looked serious as he quickly walked over, picked up his phone, and said to [Shen Xue]:
1:37:42|1:38:9|[Yan Shouyi] walked to the door and left in big strides. [Shen Xue] lit a candle, a tear suddenly rolled down her cheek. She picked up a match again and approached the flame of the candle. With a crackling sound, the match was lit. [Yan Shouyi] rushed to his hometown with his son overnight. The car drove on a bumpy stone road surrounded by mountains. [Yan Shouyi] drove the car in silence, expressionless, as the car bumped forward.
1:38:9|1:38:39|Sitting in the back seat is the nanny, holding the son of [Yan Shouyi] in her arms. The son is wearing his grandmother's jade ring on his chest. As the vehicle passes through a large flock of sheep, a cloud of dust rises on the unpaved country road. In the distance, the sky is already turning a fish-belly white, with sunlight shining on the hills on both sides. [Yan Shouyi] parks the car at the entrance of the old house, and a tricycle comes bouncing along. The tricycle is piled high with wreaths.
1:38:39|1:38:52|They untied the ropes on the car and took off the wreaths one by one. Three or five people worked together to carry the wreaths into the yard, while [Yan Shouyi] squatted at the door holding his grandmother's portrait, his head hanging silently.
1:38:53|1:39:0|Brick Brother sat on the side of the threshold, head down and despondent. People in the courtyard were busy setting up the scene for the funeral.
1:39:1|1:39:9|A white plaque hung at the door, with the words "Mother of Ceremonies for Eternity" written on it. Brick spoke to [Yan Shouyi].
1:40:33|1:41:15|Brick Brother sighed and lowered his head. After Brick Brother choked out his words, the two of them knelt in front of their grandmother's grave in white mourning clothes, kowtowed, and then slowly stood up. [Yan Shouyi] took out some firewood from his pocket, lit a match, and walked slowly forward. The ground was covered with white wreaths piled up like small mountains. [Yan Shouyi] lit a match and walked slowly forward.
1:41:15|1:41:43|He placed a match at the edge of the wreath, which instantly ignited. Brick Brother followed suit, lighting a match and placing it on the wreath as well. The mound-like wreath was gradually engulfed by flames. Brick Brother turned and walked away, joining the younger generation not far away. Everyone had a mournful expression, collectively mourning the deceased grandmother. [Yan Shouyi] stayed in place, watching the wreath burn bit by bit. His gaze was vacant, as if contemplating something.
1:41:43|1:41:54|The fire grew larger and the wreaths crackled as they burned. Suddenly, [Yan Shouyi] lowered his head and took out his phone, throwing it into the fire.
1:42:46|1:43:3|The wreath gradually burned out, and the screen slowly darkened. With the sound of high heels, the scene shifted to the home of [Yan Shouyi], where a woman in a long dress and high heels walked to the sofa and sat down. [Yan Shouyi] sat on the sofa a few meters away, with a book on his knees.
