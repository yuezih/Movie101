0:1:18|0:1:40|At this moment, the TV is broadcasting the news of the successful resolution of the shocking child abduction case that has rocked society. Under the scorching sun, a car speeds by, and on the counter of the wheat department, a sleeping face gradually appears on the screen. [Chen Xuesong] rests his head on his arm, tightly closes his eyes, and the bangs behind his ears sway with the movement of the fan.
0:1:42|0:1:48|The sound of the TV grew louder and louder, with the children's cries and the alarming sirens blending together.
0:1:57|0:2:4|Turning his head to the other side, he was deeply drawn to the news on TV. At this moment, the TV was describing the details of the kidnapping case.
0:2:10|0:2:14|Yuchengbao has gradually become familiar with the police officers.
0:2:38|0:2:53|[Wu Yanjun] walked into the supermarket wearing a floral shirt, smiling brightly. As he walked, he took out his wallet from his pocket. [Chen Xuesong] casually rummaged through the drawer and found the familiar 300 yuan in change. While holding the money in his hand, [Wu Yanjun] kept his eyes fixed on [Chen Xuesong]'s face without looking away.
0:2:54|0:3:4|[Chen Xuesong] handed over some change, turned his head to look at the TV. At that moment, the other person handed him a bill, which he glanced at and accepted, then turned around to hand over a pack of cigarettes.
0:3:33|0:3:35|But he looked around nervously.
0:3:40|0:3:47|The emperor, upon hearing these words, gave a disdainful look at [Chen Xuesong], who was grinning from ear to ear like [Wu Yanjun].
0:3:52|0:4:7|The romantic atmosphere was suddenly interrupted, [Wu Yanjun] awkwardly smiled, got up and bid farewell. Although [Wu Yanjun] was leaving, his eyes were fixed on the woman in front of him. [Chen Xuesong] stared back at [Wu Yanjun] defiantly until he got into a taxi.
0:4:7|0:4:15|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] brought a Chongqing boss to the abandoned ranch. Boss Lin walked in, looked around and raised his head.
0:4:53|0:4:58|Cai Weihang watched as the car of his old classmate drove off in a cloud of dust, then he looked down at the bright line and smiled.
0:5:26|0:5:35|At the same time, [Chen Xuesong] arrived at the school gate to wait for his daughter to finish school. He scratched his head, but didn't see his daughter's figure. Other children were being picked up one by one. He grabbed a child and asked.
0:5:48|0:6:1|This statement frightened [Cai Weihang] quite a bit. She immediately took out her phone from her bag and made a call, looking around anxiously. Upon learning that her husband did not take their daughter away, [Cai Weihang] quickly turned around and headed home.
0:6:3|0:6:20|He was in a hurry, shouting his daughter's name all the way. Passing by an old lady carrying a child, [Chen Xuesong] would always glance anxiously, wondering if it was his daughter. Sweating profusely from anxiety, he ran through the corridor and arrived at the front door of his home. He was about to push the door open, only to find that the door was still locked.
0:6:20|0:6:25|[Chen Xuesong] frowned and looked around the house.
0:6:29|0:6:45|The streets were bustling with people and the mixed sounds of vehicles. [Chen Xuesong] felt fear creeping into her heart, thinking about the recent news of child trafficking. Her legs were almost giving out. But there was still a glimmer of hope, as she hurriedly crossed one street after another.
0:6:45|0:6:57|Cai Weihang kept looking around for his daughter while listening to the sound of footsteps. He quickened his pace to search for her. Before long, he arrived at a military camp building and could hear the sounds of mahjong and ping pong from a distance.
0:6:57|0:7:16|She glanced roughly at the door, about to go out, and caught a glimpse of a figure in a daze. She turned back to confirm again, only to find that it was her daughter. Watching Yuanyuan and her mother-in-law eating together, she finally let go of the anxiety in her throat, but couldn't help feeling a bit angry inside.
0:7:19|0:7:35|He smiled in response to the neighbor's greeting, sat on the bench next to him in confusion, and turned to see the harmonious scene of the grandfather and grandson. Suddenly, for some reason, Cai Weihang's face turned dark, and he immediately stood up and walked out the door.
0:7:35|0:7:53|On the other side, Grandma is lighting candles on the cake, while [Yuanyuan] points at the candles and counts, saying to Grandma. Grandma chuckles and pats [Yuanyuan]'s head. Finally, the two puff out their cheeks and blow out the candles. At this moment, [Chen Xuesong] arrives in front of Grandma's residence.
0:8:1|0:8:15|He, who didn't want to talk, turned to look outside the main gate, then walked up the stairs and sat on the chair outside the house. After all the hustle and bustle, Cai Weihang was sweating profusely, his hair soaked. He glanced at the bag on the table, then opened it and started searching inside.
0:8:17|0:8:36|Following that, she took out a small fan from inside and blew it fiercely towards herself. At this moment, the phone rang, but she, enjoying the comfort, was reluctant to answer. It wasn't until the phone rang again that she reluctantly turned off the fan and took out her phone from her bag.
0:8:46|0:8:58|Before [Chen Xuesong] could finish speaking, the person on the other end of the phone had already hung up. He glared angrily, threw the phone down, and then slammed it shut.
0:9:5|0:9:12|The old man didn't say anything after listening, quietly took the key to open the door, while [Chen Xuesong] with anger in his heart, pushed open the door holding his daughter.
0:9:26|0:9:34|Seeing his daughter in Eva's arms, [Cai Weihang]'s anger gradually turned into grievance, tears welled up in his eyes. He choked back his emotions and said.
0:10:4|0:10:18|[Cai Weihang] walked in and glanced at the cake on the table, only then did he remember that today was his mother's birthday. He looked at his mother with a hint of guilt, then placed his helmet and messenger bag on either side of the cake. [Wu Yanjun] walked over to tidy up his bag and said.
0:10:25|0:10:40|[Cai Weihang] looked at his wife's aggressive face and turned away, unwilling to deal with her. Seeing her husband's indifferent attitude, [Chen Xuesong] turned and took their daughter's hand, walking out. [Cai Weihang], who hadn't even warmed his seat, sighed helplessly, unsure of how to face his mother.
0:10:40|0:10:46|At this moment, [Chen Xuesong] had already walked to the street corner with his daughter, when they heard the sound of a motorcycle coming from behind.
0:10:48|0:11:4|Still angry, [Chen Xuesong] glanced at her husband and continued to walk forward with her head down. Their daughter looked up at her mom, then let go of her hand and climbed onto the back seat of the motorcycle. Unable to do anything about it, [Chen Xuesong] reluctantly helped the daughter sit down. [Cai Weihang] started the motorcycle expressionlessly by twisting the throttle.
0:11:4|0:11:9|Round little hands tightly holding onto her father, sitting in the back, [Chen Xuesong], recalling everything that happened today.
0:11:10|0:11:27|Feeling exhausted both physically and mentally, the constant sound of air leaking gradually pulled him back from his thoughts. [Chen Xuesong] tried to perk up a bit, looking ahead on the road. But soon after, like a deflated balloon, he slumped against Ma Dai, sandwiched in the middle without saying a word.
0:11:28|0:11:42|Later, she turned to look at the residential buildings in the two sheds that were constantly retreating, as if since getting married, her days had been filled with mundane chores, and the simple life seemed to be nothing but a mess, as if there was no time to look up and see the beautiful scenery of this mountain city.
0:11:42|0:11:57|At night, [Chen Xuesong] finished washing up and went to the room. Seeing his daughter already asleep, he gently took the toy from her hand and then patted his husband. After that, she took her daughter's leg off her husband's leg. [Cai Weihang] frowned and slowly lifted the numb leg.
0:12:0|0:12:3|[Cai Weihang] rolled his eyes and looked at [Chen Xuesong].
0:12:7|0:12:16|[Chen Xuesong] also felt guilty after hearing it, but he still didn't let up. [Cai Weihang] listened to him say that, then turned his head and closed his eyes.
0:12:22|0:12:24|[Chen Xuesong] began to complain incessantly.
0:12:58|0:13:17|[Cai Weihang], who was full of anger, couldn't help but speak out. Hearing her husband's impatient tone, [Chen Xuesong] opened her mouth in anger, then immediately retorted. After speaking, she turned her head and went to sleep next to her daughter. [Cai Weihang] was completely provoked by this remark, she shook the blanket heavily, and then sat up.
0:13:17|0:13:35|Lying next to her, [Chen Xuesong] looked at her in this way, also looking unhappy. Then she asked a question. Cai Weihang, who was still angry, didn't want to talk to her. [Chen Xuesong] sat up again. She gently pushed her husband's shoulder, but he ignored her and pushed her hand away without any consideration.
0:13:35|0:13:45|[Chen Xuesong], who knew he was in the wrong, didn't know how to face it. [Cai Weihang], who was silently digesting, lowered his head and closed his eyes, taking a deep breath.
0:13:45|0:14:1|Early the next morning, [Chen Xuesong] opened the supermarket's rolling shutter door, but her mind was still troubled by the argument from yesterday. She looked into the distance, seeming to be tangled up in thoughts, then leaned on the counter with her head down in contemplation. With a furrowed brow, she repeatedly fumbled with the keys in her hand, then sighed helplessly.
0:14:1|0:14:4|After much thought, [Cai Weihang] raised his head, pulled down the curtain, and turned around to leave.
0:14:8|0:14:24|[Chen Xuesong]'s back gradually disappeared at the corner of the street. After a while, he pushed open a door and walked into the house. Grandma was sitting on the bed preparing to take medicine. He walked over, put down the bag, and then helped roll up his sleeves. The harmonious interaction made the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law seem a bit uncomfortable.
0:14:24|0:14:26|The old lady gently tugged at the sleeve and said a few words.
0:14:28|0:14:37|Seeing the stubborn look of the old lady, [Chen Xuesong] didn't say anything, just kept rolling up his sleeves that were gradually slipping down. After seeing the bottles and jars on the table, he couldn't help but say,
0:14:44|0:14:50|Seeing the old lady still sulking, [Chen Xuesong] helplessly turned around and sighed, then immediately spoke,
0:15:16|0:15:32|After hearing his daughter-in-law's difficulties, the old lady nervously rubbed her hands, lowered her head, unsure of what to say. At that moment, [Chen Xuesong] picked up a bag nearby, took out a few one hundred bills from his wallet, placed them by the bed, and then put the wallet back. The old lady glanced at it and said.
0:15:39|0:15:53|Seeing the stubborn look on the old lady's face, [Cai Weihang] felt helpless and didn't want to say anything more. After a while, [Cai Weihang] returned to the store and, exhausted both physically and mentally, he once again fell asleep on the counter as usual.
0:15:53|0:16:3|While wearing a floral shirt, [Wu Yanjun] was sitting in front of the counter, tilting his head to look at the sleeping face of the other person. He then tucked the money under his arm, but [Chen Xuesong] was still fast asleep.
0:16:6|0:16:19|[Wu Yanjun] knocking on the glass counter startled [Chen Xuesong] who immediately sat up. He squinted for a moment, then picked up the money on the counter and opened the drawer to search for change. [Wu Yanjun] deliberately reached out his arm, but [Chen Xuesong] lowered his head and asked.
0:16:37|0:16:53|He looked incredulous, but the other person stared back at him. A hint of confusion flashed in his eyes. Then, he lowered his head and rummaged through the drawer for change, but his eyes were still drifting to the pine tree tattoo on [Wu Yanjun]'s arm.
0:17:14|0:17:19|[Chen Xuesong] glanced at the smiling [Wu Yanjun] across from him, then counted the change in his hand.
0:17:23|0:17:38|[Wu Yanjun] continued to joke around in a non-serious manner. [Chen Xuesong] picked up the newspaper next to him and playfully hit his arm with it, then used it to fan himself. He appeared angry on the surface but a shy expression showed on his face. As the sky gradually darkened, the temperature remained hot.
0:17:38|0:17:47|[Chen Xuesong] sat alone in front of the counter, his face and neck already wet with sweat. The counter was filled with bread, and [Chen Xuesong] skillfully picked them up one by one, then threw them to the other side.
0:17:48|0:18:4|For some reason, he sighed softly, then he started tapping on the calculator with a pen, calculating today's accounts. The deafening sound of a motorcycle filled the air, at this moment, [Cai Weihang] was wearing a Chinese tunic and a helmet, riding a motorcycle forward.
0:18:4|0:18:10|The night scene on the street keeps moving backwards with the speed of the car, passing through one street after another. It stops in front of a large chess and card market.
0:18:12|0:18:25|From a distance, you could hear the sounds of playing cards and singing coming from inside. He parked the car, took out a cigarette and put it in his mouth, then leisurely walked in. The boss stood up from his chair, blocking him and asking for his ID.
0:18:55|0:19:8|After speaking, the boss pointed outside, indicating him to go back and get it. [Cai Weihang] looked at the other person in disbelief, put the cigarette in his mouth, then took out his wallet from his pocket, pulled out his ID card, and slammed it heavily on the boss's desk.
0:19:8|0:19:18|Looking at the angry face of [Cai Weihang], the boss smiled and shook his head helplessly. [Cai Weihang] then turned and went inside to find a seat. Before long, he was sitting in front of the computer screen with headphones on.
0:19:20|0:19:38|The words on the screen kept changing as the fingers tapped away. [Cai Weihang] was smoking, typing on the Tieba message board. The screen read, "Unemployed bro, seeking maintenance. Bro's demands are not high, easier to take care of than a pretty boy, just looking for three meals a day, a monthly salary of eight thousand, with car pick-up and drop-off, of course not refusing."
0:19:38|0:19:54|Not long after posting, [Cai Weihang] received a very frivolous reply, which made him unable to help but laugh. Then he smiled with a cigarette in his mouth and started typing on the keyboard again. Shortly after, he closed his own post and began browsing through the comments on other forums.
0:19:54|0:20:7|At this moment, a familiar name appeared in a post, titled "The woman who the real estate tycoon had the deepest feelings for in the past, [Chen Xuesong]." [Cai Weihang] immediately clicked on it, wanting to see who this namesake of his wife was.
0:20:7|0:20:13|The half-exposed photo inside made him even more curious, and as he scrolled, his pupils gradually dilated.
0:20:14|0:20:30|This [Chen Xuesong] is not someone with the same name and surname. The woman with a youthful smile in the photo is his wife, [Chen Xuesong]. [Cai Weihang]'s face gradually became serious. He immediately took the cigarette out of his mouth, looked around vigilantly at the people nearby, and his chest couldn't help but heave up and down.
0:20:33|0:20:49|At this moment, [Chen Xuesong] was sitting on the sofa watching TV, with knitting in his hands. After a while, he seemed to hear footsteps, turned his head to look outside the door, and then put down what he was holding and walked to the corridor, coincidentally encountering [Cai Weihang] walking in with a helmet.
0:20:49|0:21:2|She took the helmet and bag, turned around and placed the helmet on the table. [Cai Weihang] then took off his coat and went into the bathroom. [Chen Xuesong] turned his back, took out his phone from the bag, and glanced at [Cai Weihang] who was washing up.
0:21:2|0:21:14|She quickly flipped through the information inside, occasionally looking back towards the direction of the bathroom. Seeing no suspicious messages on her phone, [Chen Xuesong] glanced at her husband who was brushing his teeth, and sat back down on the sofa.
0:21:15|0:21:32|Following that, he casually tossed his phone aside and ran his hand through his hair. [Cai Weihang] took off his pants and threw them on the sofa, and [Wu Yanjun] immediately reached out, picked up the clothes, laid them on the leather, and then took out his wallet from the pocket, took out his ID card and looked at it front and back.
0:21:32|0:21:37|While [Cai Weihang] hasn't come out yet, he quickly tucked his ID card into his pocket and placed his wallet next to his phone.
0:21:39|0:21:46|After a while, [Cai Weihang] came out and sat on the sofa. [Chen Xuesong] awkwardly looked up at the clock on the wall and said.
0:21:51|0:21:54|Cai Weihang picked up the remote control and turned on the TV again.
0:22:13|0:22:31|After speaking, [Chen Xuesong] turned and walked into the room. [Cai Weihang] lit a cigarette, took a deep drag, then picked up a magazine next to him. As he fanned the smoke, he watched TV, recalling the post he saw in the internet cafe. Feeling increasingly frustrated, [Cai Weihang] suddenly caught sight of his wife's phone on the sofa, causing him to pause.
0:22:31|0:22:42|Then he turned his head to look around the room, got up and took his phone, turned his head again to double-check, and then kept flipping through all the information inside. He didn't know what he saw, suddenly put down the magazine in his hand.
0:22:43|0:23:3|Staring at the phone screen for a long time, he turned his head to look around the room again, then silently put the phone back in place and continued to fan the magazine to create a breeze, still smoking non-stop. The next morning, the patrol boat by the lake made a buzzing sound, and there were also a few figures appearing below the residential building.
0:23:3|0:23:12|In the room, [Chen Xuesong] is pouring milk, with a bowl of bread in front of him. [Cai Weihang] sits down with a dissatisfied look on his face.
0:23:17|0:23:29|[Cai Weihang] didn't want to say anything more after hearing that, he tore open the plastic wrap of the bread and took a big bite. [Chen Xuesong] sat beside him, supporting his head with his hand, smiling at [Cai Weihang], who furrowed his brows and struggled to swallow.
0:23:56|0:24:11|[Cai Weihang] glanced coldly at the bread before casually tossing it aside, then stood up and grabbed his helmet. [Wu Yanjun], with a puzzled expression while chewing on bread, watched as the other person walked away without looking back. He huffed and rolled his eyes, continuing to chew on his bread.
0:24:11|0:24:29|[Cai Weihang] walked out with her helmet and headed towards her motorcycle. Soon, her figure riding the motorcycle appeared on the bustling street. [Cai Weihang] aimlessly looked at the sides of the street, not knowing where to go. The scene then shifted to the riverside, where the noisy sounds filled the entire dock.
0:24:29|0:24:37|[Cai Weihang] sat on a stool by the small pond, chewing on a youtiao. Suddenly, a girl hurriedly ran in front of his motorcycle.
0:25:0|0:25:11|[Cai Weihang] looked at the girl in surprise, then drove towards the direction of the old dock with her. He passed through the line of motorcyclists on both sides of the road and stopped in an empty space on the side. After the girl got off the car, she handed over five yuan.
0:25:20|0:25:38|After speaking, the girl ran over excitedly and pulled the hand of the boy standing aside. Suddenly, a group of motorcycle drivers started their motorcycles and surrounded [Cai Weihang] who was standing still. He, puzzled, stared at the unfriendly eyes around him. At this moment, the leader of the drivers stopped in front of him and issued a warning.
0:25:50|0:25:59|[Cai Weihang], with a cigarette in his mouth, glared fiercely at the person he was talking to. Suddenly, the sound of a roaring engine was heard as he rode his motorcycle towards the person and started fighting with him.
0:25:59|0:26:13|The scene then shifts to a hospital, where [Cai Weihang], with an injured elbow, sits in a chair. A female doctor across from him is wrapping his wound with gauze, then reinforcing it with tape. [Cai Weihang] is holding his arm and following the doctor's movements.
0:26:17|0:26:31|He bent his arm to pick up the helmet on his leg, then stood up, holding the helmet in one hand and the bill in the other. Walking out into the corridor, he carefully flipped through an old medical record book, then tucked the bill inside. Inside the shop at that moment, a couple was shopping.
0:26:53|0:27:0|[Chen Xuesong] sighed, picked up the newspaper on the counter, and glanced at today's news, letting out a sigh.
0:27:29|0:27:37|The couple walked away without saying a word. [Chen Xuesong] glanced back and caught sight of [Wu Yanjun] touching his boot on his foot.
0:27:49|0:27:53|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] walked into the store, and [Wu Yanjun] came down from the counter to greet him.
0:27:56|0:28:0|[Wu Yanjun] finished speaking and turned towards the taxi, while [Cai Weihang] shouted at him.
0:28:21|0:28:47|[Cai Weihang], ignoring his injured arm, lifted his arm and pulled down the rolling shutter. [Chen Xuesong] was also scared by her husband's anger and dared not move. In a bad mood, [Cai Weihang] put his hands on his hips and turned his back. The two stood still for a long time, then the couple closed the door and rode their motorcycle to the street.
0:28:47|0:29:1|[Cai Weihang] drove expressionlessly along the road ahead, with [Chen Xuesong] sitting behind him, holding onto the back seat of the motorcycle and looking at the scenery on the road. When they reached the intersection, [Cai Weihang] seemed to have a purpose as he turned into a unfamiliar alleyway.
0:29:7|0:29:24|[Cai Weihang] did not answer, with a serious face still looking straight ahead, and pushed the door open even harder. The figures of the two of them became smaller and smaller as the yellow dust kicked up by the wheels drifted further away. After a while, [Cai Weihang] arrived at a huge billboard on a motorcycle. Surrounding it were unfinished buildings under construction.
0:29:24|0:29:27|Before the car even came to a stop, [Chen Xuesong] was thrown out.
0:29:54|0:30:7|[Cai Weihang] was completely enraged after hearing that. [Wu Yanjun] shouted and cursed, while [Cai Weihang] gritted his teeth and pushed [Wu Yanjun] into the garbage shed.
0:30:16|0:30:21|Cai Weihang withdrew one hand from his pants and used the other hand to lift up Chen Xuesong's skirt and press down on it.
0:30:25|0:30:40|[Chen Xuesong] opened his mouth in pain, but no sound came out of his throat. Gradually, he gave up struggling and allowed [Cai Weihang] to vent his anger on him. After a while, [Chen Xuesong] let out a sigh, looked up at the sky, his eyes filled with desolation and despair.
0:30:40|0:30:47|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] gradually calmed down, his actions no longer as violent, but [Chen Xuesong] felt that his body had lost all sensation.
0:30:53|0:31:10|Not long after, the figure of [Chen Xuesong] appeared on the dusty road, he walked slowly with his head down, his arms moving weakly with each step. At this moment, [Cai Weihang] rode up on a motorcycle and stopped beside him, but [Chen Xuesong] walked around him, still looking down and moving forward.
0:31:10|0:31:16|[Cai Weihang] saw the situation, turned his head without saying a word, stayed in place for a while, then twisted the throttle and left alone.
0:31:17|0:31:29|The crane on the construction site is rotating and operating, with a few construction workers standing nearby. [Cai Weihang] rides a motorcycle and gradually disappears at the intersection, leaving only the disheveled [Chen Xuesong] walking alone on this deserted road.
0:31:31|0:31:47|[Chen Xuesong] didn't know how long he had been walking. The sweat marks on his neck had dried up, and the collar of his clothes was soaked with sweat. He walked with his head down, silently passing through the cold underground passage. A gust of wind blew through, making his wet clothes even colder.
0:31:47|0:31:51|[Chen Xuesong] couldn't help but rub his arms and continued to walk forward with his head down.
0:32:8|0:32:24|As a mother who can be a child, [Chen Xuesong] still arrives at the school gate on time no matter how difficult it is. At this moment, she has already tidied up her hair and sits quietly in front of the flower bed. Then, [Cai Weihang] stops his motorcycle in front of the school. His eyes wander, occasionally observing his wife's expression.
0:32:24|0:32:38|After much hesitation, he walked over slowly. [Chen Xuesong] immediately stood up and walked away in the opposite direction. [Cai Weihang] watched his angrily departing figure, sighed helplessly. Later, [Cai Weihang] took his daughter to a restaurant. At this moment, he was on the phone with Boss Lin.
0:33:7|0:33:16|[Cai Weihang] was picking up food for his daughter, but she still crossed her arms and pouted, refusing to eat. He then put down the plate in his hand and said to his daughter.
0:33:36|0:33:49|[Cai Weihang] turned his head at the sound and saw [Chen Xuesong] coming up the stairs. He glanced at the food on the table, put his bag aside, and sat down. Yuanyuan happily watched her mother sitting across from her, constantly stuffing food into her own mouth.
0:33:49|0:33:57|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] scooped up a bowl of rice and brought it over, considerately placing the chopsticks on top. [Chen Xuesong] glanced at the rice and started eating with the chopsticks.
0:33:58|0:34:10|The guilty Cai Weihang didn't know what to say, he just lowered his head and quietly ate his food. He occasionally lifted his eyelids and sneakily glanced at Chen Xuesong who was eating, but the latter had a calm expression, as if nothing had ever happened.
0:34:10|0:34:22|[Chen Xuesong] had long noticed the sneaky glances from [Cai Weihang], but he held his breath and refused to look him in the eye. Later, [Chen Xuesong] scooped a mouthful of rice from his bowl, chewing slowly, but only he knew what was really on his mind.
0:34:24|0:34:41|Early the next morning, as [Chen Xuesong] walked to the intersection, he heard a honk behind him. He glanced back and continued walking, but was stopped by [Wu Yanjun]. Sitting in the car, [Wu Yanjun] smiled at him. After hesitating for a moment, [Chen Xuesong] walked towards the stopped taxi.
0:34:41|0:34:56|He didn't care about the looks from others on the roadside, walking while taking the bag off his shoulder, opening the passenger door and sitting in. [Wu Yanjun] was also surprised by his unusual behavior. On the road, [Chen Xuesong] was feeling hot, so he rolled up the window and turned to [Wu Yanjun] saying.
0:35:2|0:35:13|[Chen Xuesong] looked down at his arm, showing a displeased expression. [Chen Xuesong] stared ahead, furrowing his brow, not saying a word.
0:35:16|0:35:25|[Chen Xuesong] still looked straight ahead into the distance, nodding [Wu Yanjun]. He glanced at him and said.
0:35:27|0:35:40|Before long, [Wu Yanjun] drove his taxi to the mysterious place he mentioned. The sign by the road read "Baisha Republic Style Street," with dilapidated billboards standing on the rooftops and the glass of the buildings long shattered.
0:35:40|0:35:47|[Wu Yanjun] parked the car at the next turn, while [Chen Xuesong] looked out of the window with excitement. As they walked, [Wu Yanjun] turned and asked.
0:35:53|0:36:1|After speaking, [Chen Xuesong] looked elsewhere. A phone rang, and [Wu Yanjun] took out his phone from his pocket, glanced at it, and immediately hung up.
0:36:9|0:36:32|Watching [Wu Yanjun] walking casually, [Chen Xuesong] made a light sound and continued to walk forward on his own. [Wu Yanjun] behind him smiled and followed. The old-fashioned houses of the Republic of China era deeply attracted [Chen Xuesong]'s attention. When they saw the signboard of the grand theater, the two of them stopped in their tracks simultaneously.
0:36:32|0:36:36|Facing the complaints from the delivery guy, [Cai Weihang] immediately walked up and opened the door.
0:36:39|0:36:52|The young man carried a box of beer into the store, Cai Weihang put away the keys and moved another box in. Then he took out his phone, dialed [Chen Xuesong]'s number, looking around with his eyes. After finding the call failed, he dialed again.
0:36:52|0:36:59|[Chen Xuesong], who was taking a walk at the moment, heard a phone ringing in his bag. He raised his hand, took out his phone and glanced at it, then silently pressed the hang-up button.
0:37:0|0:37:18|Before long, the phone rang again. Without hesitation, he hung up again. Hearing [Chen Xuesong]'s phone ringing non-stop, [Wu Yanjun] took a few steps away and turned back to see [Chen Xuesong] holding the phone and looking into the distance, showing no intention of answering the call. [Chen Xuesong] tightened his grip on the phone and turned his head away, letting the phone ring.
0:37:19|0:37:35|After a while, feeling upset, he opened his phone and pressed the power button, then stuffed the phone back into his bag. [Wu Yanjun] looked at the angry [Chen Xuesong], feeling puzzled inside. Yet, [Chen Xuesong]'s tantrum seemed quite cute to Jing, making her unable to hold back a smile.
0:37:35|0:37:40|Later, the two of them walked into the abandoned grand theater, and the desolate scene inside was truly astonishing.
0:37:41|0:37:56|The cement floor cracked open in all directions, and the tiles on the roof seemed to be at risk of falling off at any moment. On the dirty and messy stage, reflecting a bit of sunlight from outside, [Chen Xuesong] looked around with excitement. At this moment, [Wu Yanjun] quietly took [Chen Xuesong]'s hand and showed a shy smile.
0:38:1|0:38:11|After speaking, he moved [Wu Yanjun]'s hand away and turned to look out the window. [Wu Yanjun] looked a bit disappointed, glanced at him, and then walked silently to the front.
0:38:11|0:38:22|[Chen Xuesong] looked at him in confusion, only to see [Wu Yanjun] speed up and take a few steps, then he high-kicked onto the stage. After standing up, he clapped his hands, then bent down to pick up a tree branch and slowly walked towards the center of the stage.
0:39:11|0:39:25|[Wu Yanjun] stood in the center of the stage, holding a branch and singing a sentimental song. [Chen Xuesong] in the audience looked at him, tears welling up in his eyes for some unknown reason. Perhaps he had never imagined that the romance he longed for would be given by a young punk.
0:39:31|0:39:48|In the distance, the mountain peaks gradually emerged from the thick fog, with houses scattered on the slopes. On the way back, [Chen Xuesong] happily looked out the window, as if the emotions suppressed in his heart for the past few days had also been relieved. He occasionally turned to look at [Wu Yanjun], who was driving, but quickly averted his gaze when noticed.
0:39:48|0:39:55|[Wu Yanjun] looked at him and couldn't help but smile, while [Chen Xuesong] stared ahead with a proud expression, but the corners of his mouth revealed an uncontrollable smile.
0:39:57|0:40:14|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] was standing at the school gate waiting for his daughter to finish school. He was about to make a phone call when he froze in place. He craned his neck to look into the distance, his face instantly darkening. He saw [Chen Xuesong] getting out of the car and turning around, while [Wu Yanjun] stood with both hands on the opposite car roof, waving and smiling.
0:40:24|0:40:29|Seeing her husband's cold and indifferent look, [Chen Xuesong] was furious.
0:40:52|0:41:0|The angry roar attracted the parents nearby, but [Chen Xuesong] pretended not to hear, [Cai Weihang] gave a disdainful glance, and walked off in the opposite direction in a huff.
0:41:13|0:41:29|[Cai Weihang] hesitated, but he had already boarded the bus bound for Chongqing. He leaned back against the seat, looking out the window listlessly. Despite the urgent ringing of his phone in his pocket, [Cai Weihang] stubbornly ignored it, staring blankly at the receding scenery.
0:41:29|0:41:44|Not long after, the scenery outside the window had changed from layers of buildings to an endless sky. At this moment, [Cai Weihang] had already boarded the light rail to his destination. Despite the continuous ringing of his phone, he was captivated by the city scenery and paid no attention to it.
0:41:47|0:42:4|In the distance, tall buildings stand in rows, the streets are bustling with traffic, and the crowded crowd flows like a tide. A clear female voice from the light rail's broadcast reminds every passenger on board. [Cai Weihang] slowly comes to his senses, looks down at his phone, quickly presses the hang-up button, and then turns his head to look out the window again.
0:42:4|0:42:13|The night gradually unfolds, with neon lights in the city intertwining with each other. [Cai Weihang] sits in a seat by the window, holding his head with his hand, quietly looking outside.
0:42:14|0:42:29|At this point, there was no longer a sense of novelty in his eyes, only fatigue remained. After getting off the train station, [Cai Weihang] took the escalator to the exit. As soon as he got down, he saw a homeless man lying on the ground, huddled up and sleeping soundly with his legs curled up.
0:42:29|0:42:39|Next to the trash can, an elderly man with mobility issues is struggling to dig out bottles from it, while a farmer worker sitting on the ground is guarding a suitcase, nibbling on a pear in his hand, looking around blankly.
0:42:40|0:42:56|[Cai Weihang] walked out while observing everything around him. A couple spread a newspaper on the ground, with the woman leaning against the man's chest, frowning from time to time as she complained to him. A middle-aged auntie sat on a wooden stool next to them, earnestly shining shoes for people.
0:42:56|0:43:8|After a while, [Cai Weihang] got on the elevator heading to the destination. The elevator in the mall was transparent and spacious. [Cai Weihang] stood inside looking around, then turned around and grabbed the handrail, looking around everywhere.
0:43:8|0:43:14|Upon reaching the designated floor, as the elevator doors opened, [Cai Weihang] stepped out and was immediately captivated by the intricate carvings on the ceiling of the corridor.
0:43:28|0:43:43|Lin's furniture store is filled with furniture of various styles. When [Cai Weihang] saw it, his eyes lit up. He couldn't help but touch the patterns on the chair, and then sat on the soft sample bed. After sitting for a while, he was attracted by the exquisite patterns at the foot of the bed.
0:43:43|0:43:54|He touched it with his fingers, then opened his palm and made a rough gesture. Later, the two of them arrived at the nightclub, where the hostess on the opposite side leaned her head on [Boss Lin]'s shoulder, revealing a charming smile.
0:43:59|0:44:16|[Mr. Lin] handed over a book with elegant European style to [Cai Weihang], who put away the cigarette in his hand and flipped through it.
0:44:32|0:44:49|At this moment, [Chen Xuesong] was still continuously calling [Cai Weihang], but he still didn't pick up. His daughter was already fast asleep beside him, and [Chen Xuesong] was getting extremely anxious, deciding to go look around nearby. Most of the shops on the street had already closed, with only a few shop owners packing up and preparing to close their stores.
0:44:53|0:45:8|[Chen Xuesong] left disappointed after hearing that, and continued to walk away. Soon, the tea garden also closed for the day, shutting its gates, and the lights on the street grew dimmer. The dark and quiet night road made him feel scared, and [Chen Xuesong] kept looking back at the empty street behind him from time to time.
0:45:10|0:45:24|Not long after, he arrived at the factory where [Cai Weihang] used to work. A large iron padlock hung on the gate, but there was enough space in the middle for one person to pass through. [Wu Yanjun] bent down and squeezed in. As soon as he got close to the door, he heard the clattering sound of mahjong tiles inside.
0:45:24|0:45:36|[Chen Xuesong] walked inside and found that the seal on the door had been torn off. There were many cardboard boxes on the floor, each with a seal on it. He stood outside and looked around, then followed the sound into the house.
0:45:37|0:45:41|Upon entering, [Cai Weihang] saw the older sister who opened the door and immediately walked over to ask.
0:46:0|0:46:14|The neighbor's joke, though, sounded particularly harsh to [Chen Xuesong], who turned around and looked at the tables next door, but did not see her husband. At this moment, in Chongqing, [Cai Weihang] hurriedly ran into the rear hall.
0:46:14|0:46:23|[Cai Weihang] helplessly glanced at the ticket seller, picked up the bag in his hand and walked out, then turned back to look at the departure time table on the wall with lingering reluctance.
0:46:23|0:46:49|Opening the phone to check the time, but instead of that, [Cai Weihang] sees 19 missed calls from [Chen Xuesong]. She hesitates for a moment, then puts the phone back with a stern face, and quickly walks towards the ticket office. [Cai Weihang] lowers his head, swiftly passing by the aunties promoting their guesthouse, and arrives at the deserted street.
0:46:49|0:47:8|She hurriedly walked up the stairs, slinging the bag behind her and walking away. On the street, a few taxis with their lights on were still displaying their "for hire" signs. After a while, she dragged her weary body into a hotel and inquired at the front desk.
0:47:8|0:47:24|The girl at the front desk nervously flipped through the documents in her hand, while [Cai Weihang] placed the bag on the counter, freeing up his hands to take out his wallet from his pocket. He searched inside but couldn't find his ID card, then raised his hand to touch the pockets on both sides, but still couldn't find it.
0:47:24|0:47:27|She immediately picked up her phone in a fit of anger and dialed a number.
0:47:43|0:47:50|[Cai Weihang] angrily hung up the phone, firming his resolve not to go back home. He turned and walked towards the front desk, awkwardly rubbing his hands.
0:47:56|0:48:0|She suppressed her anger, helplessly put away the wallet, took the bag and turned to walk outside.
0:48:10|0:48:27|[Cai Weihang] turned his head and glanced at the sofa in the hall, still a little unwilling. However, not long after, he was already lying on the sofa, muttering to himself. With one hand resting on the edge of the sofa, a thin sheet covering his body, [Cai Weihang] ended his day of hustle and bustle in a disheveled manner.
0:48:27|0:48:33|Early the next morning, he returned home with a backpack. Sitting on the bed, [Chen Xuesong] saw his figure in the mirror and immediately looked towards the door.
0:48:34|0:48:48|[Cai Weihang] stood at the door, paused for a moment, then walked in. [Chen Xuesong] stared straight at him, but he pretended not to see, threw the bag onto the bed, took off his shirt and lay down. Looking at his tired appearance, [Chen Xuesong] asked.
0:49:2|0:49:24|[Cai Weihang] finished speaking, took out his wallet from his pocket unenthusiastically. He pulled out the remaining money and tossed it to [Chen Xuesong]. Then, he stood up and sat on the edge of the bed with his back turned. [Chen Xuesong] glared angrily, then picked up the money on the bed and started counting. At that moment, [Cai Weihang]'s phone rang.
0:49:32|0:49:40|[Chen Xuesong] was still in doubt at this moment. Before long, [Cai Weihang] appeared among the shimmering wine glasses, reaching out to offer a cigarette.
0:49:56|0:50:4|Beside him, his brothers spoke kindly to him. [Cai Weihang] smiled and clinked glasses with them, then frowned as he drank it down. At that moment, the factory manager spoke to [Cai Weihang].
0:51:5|0:51:19|Master, [Cai Weihang] heard what the factory director said, his face instantly changed. He helplessly lowered his head and threw the crumpled paper in his hand on the table. Without a word, the drunken [Cai Weihang] was supported out by his coworkers, cursing angrily.
0:51:26|0:51:31|[Chen Xuesong] hurried over and stopped [Cai Weihang].
0:51:49|0:51:58|Directly, [Cai Weihang] pushed [Chen Xuesong] away and ran towards home as if going crazy. [Chen Xuesong] steadied himself and followed, only to see [Cai Weihang] rushing out with a kitchen knife.
0:52:5|0:52:9|[Chen Xuesong] cautiously peeked out and then quickly locked the door before catching up.
0:52:17|0:52:20|Changchang has already returned to her son's home in Chongqing. In the bitter cold wind, [Cai Weihong] shouted and waved a kitchen knife wildly.
0:52:31|0:52:33|[Cai Weihang] picked up a kitchen knife and chopped towards the tree trunk.
0:53:2|0:53:12|[Chen Xuesong], who had not slept all night, sat in the shop the next morning with swollen eyes. He furrowed his brow as if pondering something, occasionally looking down at the phone beside him, his face filled with indecision.
0:53:12|0:53:22|After a while, [Chen Xuesong]'s eyes suddenly became determined. He took out his phone from the drawer, dialed a number, and stared at the screen, hesitating to make the call.
0:53:23|0:53:28|Later, [Chen Xuesong] glanced around before pressing the dial button and putting the phone to his ear.
0:53:33|0:53:43|After waiting for a few seconds, [Cai Weihang] held the phone in one hand and frantically searched for a pen and paper with the other. In his urgency, he grabbed a nearby newspaper, unfolded it, and continuously jotted down the information from the phone call.
0:53:44|0:53:56|Later, [Chen Xuesong] held a phone number written on a newspaper, walking quietly at the end of the shelves. He kept looking back, making sure no one was around, and immediately dialed the phone number of Ji Jiang Real Estate Company.
0:54:21|0:54:35|After hanging up the phone, [Cai Weihang] felt relieved, but inexplicably guilty. In the afternoon, [Cai Weihang] walked into a real estate company, with long hair and wearing a floral dress from his youth, a stark contrast to his usual appearance.
0:54:35|0:54:43|He smoothed his hair and slowly walked up the stairs, the anxiety in [Chen Xuesong]'s heart growing stronger with each step of his footsteps.
0:54:59|0:55:3|After speaking, he took off his gloves for playing ball and sat opposite [Chen Xuesong].
0:55:16|0:55:32|[Chen Xuesong] said nothing, just kept looking at [Yang Jiucheng], opened his mouth as if to speak but then hesitated, showing a look of embarrassment and lowered his head. That night, [Chen Xuesong] sat at the table, calmly picked up the newspaper placed on the table, only to see a neat stack of banknotes scattered in front of him.
0:55:49|0:56:7|Watching [Chen Xuesong] pretending to be relaxed, [Cai Weihang] remained silent and quietly lowered his head. He never expected that his wife would go to borrow money from an old acquaintance for herself. However, [Cai Weihang] also understood that his wife's humble request to Yang Jiu Cheng was for the sake of his own business venture.
0:56:7|0:56:12|But the thought of having humiliated his wife because of Yang Jiucheng in the past made him feel even worse.
0:56:13|0:56:27|At night, [Chen Xuesong] lay on the bed, unable to fall asleep, thinking about the events of the day. At this moment, [Cai Weihang], who was sleeping on the other side, gently put down the leg of their daughter resting on his body, and then slowly turned over. Hearing movement behind him, [Chen Xuesong] immediately closed his eyes pretending to be asleep.
0:56:33|0:56:45|He persistently patted [Chen Xuesong]'s shoulder, but the other person turned his whole body away, unwilling to pay attention to him. [Cai Weihang]'s hand hung in the air, unsure of how to ease his wife's grievances.
0:56:45|0:56:58|At this moment, [Chen Xuesong] felt a mess in his head, recalling the embarrassment of borrowing money and feeling both helpless and ashamed. Then, [Cai Weihang] sat up, moved his sleeping daughter aside, and lay down slowly next to his wife.
0:57:4|0:57:16|The tension between the couple in recent days seemed to thaw at this moment. [Chen Xuesong] let out a deep sigh, tears welling up in his eyes. The next morning, [Cai Weihang] arrived at his sister's printing shop.
0:57:32|0:57:44|The younger sister took a sip of water and put down the cup. Seeing her sister's indifferent look, [Cai Weihang] said discontentedly. The younger sister gave a charming glance and said.
0:57:58|0:58:12|[Cai Weihang] was hit on a sore spot and angrily slammed the pen on the table. His sister stood up and spoke to the [waiter] next to her. Upon hearing this, the [waiter] immediately got up and walked out. [Cai Weihang] sat there with a dark expression, not knowing what his sister was up to.
0:58:12|0:58:19|The younger sister walked to the door, pulled a chair and sat next to [Cai Weihang]. She leaned on the table and said earnestly.
0:58:34|0:58:40|[Cai Weihang] picks up a lighter, lights the cigarette in his mouth, and then twists his head to the other side.
0:58:44|0:59:1|Upon hearing this, [Cai Weihang], who was originally indifferent, stared at his sister with wide eyes. He looked at his sister incredulously, but started to doubt in his heart. After leaving the store, [Cai Weihang] rode his motorcycle alone to a housing area right next to the train station. He held a cigarette in his hand, but had no mood to smoke.
0:59:1|0:59:16|The train roared past him, but [Cai Weihang]'s mind was still on what his sister had said. When he got home, [Cai Weihang] was in a state of collapse. He sat at the table with messy hair, staring blankly at the 150,000 cash in front of him.
0:59:16|0:59:21|The next morning, the opening ceremony of [Cai Weihang] went smoothly, and everyone gathered together in the hotel.
0:59:25|0:59:35|[Chen Xuesong] smiled and handed a few candies to Yuan Yuan. At this moment, several people suddenly entered from the door, holding a signboard. He stood up with a smile and looked at the signboard with the four big characters "Prosperous Business" on it.
0:59:38|0:59:43|His expression changed instantly. [Cai Weihang] lowered his head and sat down in confusion, looking nervous.
0:59:44|1:0:2|He secretly glanced around at the people, feeling extremely uncomfortable. After a while, he stood up and quickly walked towards the direction of the restroom. [Cai Weihang] turned his head away, while his colleague at the next table angrily complained to his friend. [Cai Weihang] lit a cigarette and walked outside.
1:0:2|1:0:9|A worker moving things nearby greeted with a smile, as Yuan Yuan pulled [Chen Xuesong] to the flower basket and turned around.
1:0:32|1:0:40|Cai Weihang stood in the distance, looking at the round and cute face, then looked up at [Chen Xuesong].
1:0:44|1:1:1|Cai Weihang watched as the innocent and naive Yuanyuan held a small flower in her hand and couldn't help but smell it. The more he looked at Yuanyuan, the more uneasy he felt. He turned around, touched his face and nose, and remembered his sister's words, starting to doubt whether Yuanyuan was his biological daughter.
1:1:2|1:1:18|At night, [Wu Yanjun] was waiting outside a health club, while his friends were busy washing cars on the side. Suddenly, a car drove up and stopped at the entrance of the health club. Driven by curiosity, he turned to look at the person getting out of the car, only to see that it was Cai Weihang.
1:1:21|1:1:38|Wu Yanjun looked at the beaming [Cai Weihang] with a hint of disbelief. He turned back to look again, making sure he wasn't mistaken. Wu Yanjun took a drag from his cigarette, his expression turning serious as if contemplating something. Then, he took out his phone from his pocket and started tapping on the screen.
1:1:38|1:1:43|After hesitating for a few seconds, he pressed the dial button, put the phone to his ear, and waited for the call to be answered.
1:1:48|1:2:0|[Chen Xuesong] walked in, took a look around the surroundings, and sat down on a chair in the lobby. He kept turning his head to look towards the corridor, hoping to catch a glimpse of [Cai Weihang].
1:2:3|1:2:18|At this moment, a girl in a sundress walked in despite the security guard's obstruction, with a look of anger on her face. [Chen Xuesong] curiously looked at the girl sitting next to him, only to be given a cold stare in return. Subsequently, the two leaned back in their chairs, waiting for their target individuals.
1:2:18|1:2:29|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] was led out by a beautiful woman. As he walked out, he pushed away the woman's hand. Boss Lin smiled and stuck close to the woman, following behind him.
1:2:38|1:2:47|[Chen Xuesong] looked at [Cai Weihang] going to pay the bill, and his mind buzzed. At this moment, the girl in suspenders rushed up and punched Boss Lin.
1:3:2|1:3:7|The disheveled Cai Weihang was about to go out to check on Boss Lin's situation, but turned around to see Chen Xuesong standing still.
1:3:13|1:3:28|Cai Weihang left Chen Xuesong behind and ran out alone, only to see the back of Boss Lin walking away with the suspender girl. Cai Weihang stood there with a vacant look in his eyes, starting to worry about his business. He turned around, glared at Chen Xuesong in the hall, and put his hands in his pockets.
1:3:28|1:3:40|Not long after, [Chen Xuesong] walked out with his wallet. He stared at [Cai Weihang] at the door for a long time, then turned around and walked silently towards the street. His face was pale, expressionless, as if his heart had turned into a stagnant pool.
1:3:41|1:3:48|Cai Weihang felt that his wife was being unreasonable at the moment. He glanced irritably at the meddling [Chen Xuesong] before following up to complain.
1:4:7|1:4:13|Seeing her husband looking self-righteous, [Chen Xuesong] stared at him with big eyes, tears welling up in her eyes. She turned her head and said angrily.
1:4:15|1:4:18|Cai Weihang hurriedly followed her and explained when he saw her like this.
1:4:35|1:4:52|[Chen Xuesong] listened to these words, glared at Cai Weihang, angrily ran to the side of the road, closed his eyes tightly, and let out a long sigh. Then, [Chen Xuesong] looked up, glanced around, suddenly saw Wu Yanjun's car parked not far away, so he ran up to the car, and after getting in, neither of them spoke.
1:4:59|1:5:12|Seeing the distressed look on [Chen Xuesong], Wu Yanjun couldn't help but blame himself. He looked at [Chen Xuesong] with heartache, unsure of how to comfort him. Then he asked. [Chen Xuesong] stared ahead, pondered for a moment, and replied.
1:5:12|1:5:27|Next, the two of them arrived at an internet cafe. Wu Yanjun found the post about [Chen Xuesong] and Yang Jiucheng on Tieba, with a photo of himself sitting next to Yang Jiucheng. [Chen Xuesong] stared at the so-called verification photo in the post, Wu Yanjun couldn't bear it and immediately shut down the computer.
1:5:28|1:5:42|Later, the two of them returned to the car, with [Chen Xuesong] sitting silently in the passenger seat.
1:5:45|1:5:56|As a mother, leaving her daughter alone at home, she felt deeply helpless and self-blaming. The accumulated grievances in her heart burst out at this moment, and tears gushed out like digging the ground. 
1:5:57|1:6:10|Seeing [Chen Xuesong] in tears, [Wu Yanjun] felt at a loss. He raised his hand and gently patted [Chen Xuesong]'s shoulder, but the latter cried even harder. Then, he reached out and embraced [Chen Xuesong].
1:6:10|1:6:16|[Chen Xuesong]'s fragile heart found solace in this moment, as he leaned on [Wu Yanjun]'s shoulder and burst into tears without reservation.
1:6:22|1:6:37|[Wu Yanjun] gently felt his shoulder, [Chen Xuesong] tried hard to control his emotions, but still couldn't help sobbing softly. After a while, he wiped away his tears, sat up, lowered his head to calm down, and looked out the window with tears in his eyes.
1:6:37|1:6:53|At this moment, he suddenly stopped crying and silently looked outside. [Wu Yanjun] also turned to look and saw [Cai Weihang] walking briskly towards home with a key in hand. [Chen Xuesong] felt angry again in his heart, glaring fiercely at [Cai Weihang]'s back. [Wu Yanjun] also looked on indignantly.
1:6:53|1:7:6|At this moment, [Chen Xuesong] suddenly turned around and held his face. Without realizing what was happening, [Wu Yanjun] was caught off guard by [Chen Xuesong] and forcefully kissed. [Chen Xuesong] held onto [Wu Yanjun]'s neck tightly, as if venting out the anger in his heart.
1:7:6|1:7:9|[Wu Yanjun] reached out his arm and tightly hugged his back.
1:7:10|1:7:18|Suddenly, [Chen Xuesong] cried and pushed away the reluctant [Wu Yanjun], then immediately got out of the car. Sitting in the car, [Wu Yanjun] stared blankly at [Chen Xuesong] walking away.
1:7:28|1:7:40|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] came to the hotel alone and opened a room. She sat dejectedly on the bed, recalling everything that had happened today - her husband's lack of understanding and trust, which became a thorn in [Cai Weihang]'s heart.
1:7:40|1:7:46|What's even more disappointing to her is that even if she swallowed her pride to borrow money from Yang Jiu Cheng, the result was like this.
1:7:53|1:8:7|Yuanyuan was already sound asleep on the sofa, with [Cai Weihang] gently stroking her small feet. At this moment, the TV was playing her wedding video with [Chen Xuesong], and [Cai Weihang] sitting on the sofa smiled as he enjoyed the beautiful memories of the past, his eyes inexplicably moistening.
1:8:9|1:8:14|In the video tape, [Chen Xuesong] in a wedding dress is beaming with happiness.
1:8:32|1:8:36|Early the next morning, [Wu Yanjun] was in a taxi wiping the rearview mirror with a cloth.
1:8:37|1:8:44|Suddenly, the car door was opened, and he turned around in confusion, only to see [Cai Weihang] sitting angrily in the passenger seat.
1:8:48|1:9:3|The two arrived at a secluded path, and a cement truck rumbled past the taxi. The already muddy road was further crushed by the wheels, sinking deep into the mud and water. The lake ahead was shrouded in a thin mist, and [Wu Yanjun] parked the car by the shore.
1:9:3|1:9:19|Sitting in the passenger seat, [Cai Weihang] gets out of the car, walks to the other side, opens the door, and then heads towards the lake. Inside the car, [Wu Yanjun] watches the unusual behavior of [Cai Weihang] with confusion. He slowly gets out of the car and slams the door shut. Then, he strides towards [Cai Weihang] who has his back to him.
1:9:47|1:10:6|Seeing [Wu Yanjun] looking indifferent, [Cai Weihang] instantly got angry. He walked over, glared at [Wu Yanjun], gritted his teeth and said. Seeing [Wu Yanjun] showing no fear at all, [Cai Weihang] was taken aback for a moment, but then more anger kept surging into his heart.
1:10:6|1:10:8|He looked [Wu Yanjun] up and down and said.
1:10:26|1:10:39|[Cai Weihang] grabbed [Wu Yanjun] by the collar and pushed him back. However, [Wu Yanjun] stood still, showing a defiant expression. Suddenly, [Cai Weihang] reached out and started slapping himself wildly. He kept slapping himself as he walked away.
1:10:39|1:10:49|Later, Cai Weihang, in despair, knelt on the ground helplessly, fists clenched, pounding the ground heavily. The inner unwillingness and pain ruthlessly tortured the already humble heart.
1:10:58|1:11:7|Cai Weihang's wailing echoed in the ears, while [Wu Yanjun]'s eyes became more determined. When they got home, [Cai Weihang] was cooking, and then they heard a knock on the door.
1:11:26|1:11:32|[Cai Weihang] hid behind the door frame, watching the back of the police officer, his mind also starting to wonder what [Chen Xuesong] had done.
1:11:53|1:12:7|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] ran out of breath and stood outside the door. [Cai Weihang] looked determinedly at the police, then turned to glance at [Chen Xuesong] inside before excitedly walking away.
1:12:17|1:12:25|After the two of them came out of the police station, [Cai Weihang] became more suspicious, while [Chen Xuesong] remained silent and walked ahead. Unable to hold back, [Cai Weihang] asked,
1:12:35|1:12:40|Listening to the skeptical tone of [Cai Weihang], [Chen Xuesong] didn't want to explain anymore. He immediately said,
1:12:48|1:12:57|[Cai Weihang] glanced at the sarcastic [Chen Xuesong], then turned his head to the other side and left angrily. Halfway through, he turned back and stood in front of [Chen Xuesong].
1:13:15|1:13:30|[Chen Xuesong] couldn't stand [Cai Weihang]'s suspicion anymore and was forced to speak sarcastically. He stared defiantly at [Cai Weihang], his eyes flashing with uncontrollable anger. Seeing [Chen Xuesong]'s stubborn look, [Cai Weihang] didn't want to say anything more and immediately turned around and left.
1:13:31|1:13:45|[Chen Xuesong] watched as her husband walked away, tears streaming down her face uncontrollably. The next morning, [Chen Xuesong] sat at the supermarket entrance knitting a sweater, when suddenly she heard the sound of a car door closing beside her. She turned her head and saw [Wu Yanjun] walking towards her.
1:13:45|1:13:53|[Chen Xuesong] ignored it and continued knitting the sweater. [Wu Yanjun] walked over and sat on the nearby bench. She bent down and stared straight at [Chen Xuesong].
1:13:57|1:14:3|[Chen Xuesong] looked up upon hearing it, waiting for [Wu Yanjun] to announce today's news, but the latter just stared at her without saying a word.
1:14:4|1:14:6|After speaking, he started sewing again with the needle and thread in his hands.
1:14:9|1:14:21|Upon hearing this, [Chen Xuesong]'s hands paused in knitting the sweater. He didn't know what [Wu Yanjun] meant by "laying the cards on the table," nor did he know what [Cai Weihang] had told him. Then, he looked at [Wu Yanjun] with confusion.
1:14:22|1:14:28|After hearing this sentence, [Chen Xuesong] suddenly understood something, but he was unwilling to believe it, thinking that [Wu Yanjun] was joking.
1:14:29|1:14:35|After rejecting [Wu Yanjun], he no longer had the mood to knit. He tidied up the needles and threads in his arms and walked towards the counter.
1:14:41|1:14:50|[Wu Yanjun] placed both hands on the counter, waiting for a response. [Chen Xuesong] lowered his head without saying a word, silently shook his head, and when he saw the other person still not leaving, he shook his head again.
1:14:53|1:15:3|[Chen Xuesong] still dared not look up, nor did he want to give an answer. The sudden temper of [Wu Yanjun] frightened [Chen Xuesong], who furrowed his brow and lifted his head, unsure of how to face it.
1:15:6|1:15:17|After being rejected again, [Wu Yanjun]'s face instantly changed. The tender eyes that were only for [Chen Xuesong] now turned as cold as an ice cellar. He glared angrily at [Chen Xuesong], feeling ridiculous about himself.
1:15:18|1:15:35|[Wu Yanjun] slowly bent down, leaning his arms on the counter, recalling the passionate kiss with [Chen Xuesong] in the car that day. At that moment, he realized that it was all just his own wishful thinking. Without looking back, [Wu Yanjun] got into the car, stepped on the gas pedal, and drove away in the taxi.
1:15:39|1:15:52|[Chen Xuesong] stood still with his head down, listening to the sound of [Wu Yanjun] driving away. The restrained [Chen Xuesong] then cried out, but quickly stopped. In the afternoon, she, as usual, came to the kindergarten gate to wait for her daughter.
1:16:3|1:16:18|[Chen Xuesong] smiled and bid farewell to the teacher, then immediately took out his phone to call [Cai Weihang]. Just as he was about to speak, the call was abruptly ended by the other party. Puzzled, he looked at his phone, not knowing what mischief [Cai Weihang] was up to. Helpless, [Chen Xuesong] stood at the school gate.
1:16:20|1:16:32|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] sat expressionless on a bus. Beside him, Yuan Yuan excitedly looked out the window, showing a sweet smile. With a heavy heart, [Cai Weihang] closed his eyes and fell into a deep sleep against the seat back.
1:16:32|1:16:40|Not long after, [Cai Weihang] was already holding Yuanyuan, sitting in the lobby of a hospital. A family of three sitting on the chairs next to him caught [Cai Weihang]'s attention.
1:16:43|1:16:54|[Cai Weihang] glanced at the number ticket in his hand, then picked up the briefcase next to him and took out his wallet from it. Immediately, he stood up and walked over to sit on the chair at the consultation desk.
1:17:4|1:17:16|[Cai Weihang] stood up to pay the bill after taking the list from the nurse, but his eyes were fixed on [Yuan Yuan]. Sitting on the chair, [Yuan Yuan] stared at her father with big eyes. As soon as her father walked away, [Yuan Yuan] immediately took out her phone from her bag.
1:17:16|1:17:22|She skillfully found her mother's phone number, then put the phone to her ear, waiting quietly. 
1:17:38|1:17:54|Shortly after, the father and daughter arrived at the parent-child identification center. The tilted [Cai Weihang] appeared in the camera's lens. Beside him, [Yuan Yuan] sat obediently on a chair. After the photo was taken, [Cai Weihang] held Yuan Yuan's hand and walked to the blood collection center. A nurse wearing gloves was disinfecting Yuan Yuan's fingers.
1:17:54|1:17:57|[Cai Weihang] couldn't help but worry as he looked at the cotton swab in the nurse's hand.
1:18:4|1:18:13|Seeing his daughter's fearful expression, [Cai Weihang] felt a sudden pang in his heart. When he turned back to the nurse, he quickly pulled back his chubby hand.
1:18:16|1:18:30|[Cai Weihang] lowered his head and looked at Yuanyuan with a heartache. Meanwhile, [Chen Xuesong] was sitting on the sofa at home waiting. Yuanyuan ran into the room, tightly hugged [Chen Xuesong]'s neck, and then took out the doll in her hand.
1:18:34|1:18:40|[Chen Xuesong] patted his round head, at this moment [Cai Weihang] walked in cautiously and looked at [Chen Xuesong].
1:18:44|1:18:49|Yuan Yuan looked at her mother's unhappy expression, pouted, but still obediently put down the doll and ran out.
1:18:50|1:19:4|Cai Weihang walked in with his head down, like a child who had done something wrong, not daring to look directly at [Chen Xuesong]. He bent down to put down what he was holding and sat on the sofa, his eyes darting around. After a while, he looked up at [Chen Xuesong] with a somewhat nervous expression.
1:19:4|1:19:21|[Chen Xuesong] supported his hands on his legs, turned his head to the other side, and said. After [Chen Xuesong] finished speaking with a pretense of calm, he turned his face to the other side. Cai Weihang heard these words and instantly widened his eyes. He looked at [Chen Xuesong] in a panic, regret starting to creep into his heart.
1:19:26|1:19:33|Sitting across from him, [Chen Xuesong] did not respond. He slowly picked up the bag on the table, pulled up the already prepared suitcase, and got up to leave.
1:19:52|1:20:11|[Chen Xuesong] repeatedly tried to snatch the suitcase from Cai Weihang, but was blocked by Cai Weihang multiple times. Unable to retrieve the suitcase, he stubbornly shook off Cai Weihang's hand, then dropped the suitcase and walked out, leaving the small house where the couple had lived for many years. Soon, his figure disappeared at the end of the corridor.
1:20:11|1:20:15|[Cai Weihang] paused for a moment in place, immediately dropped the suitcase in his hand, and quickly chased after.
