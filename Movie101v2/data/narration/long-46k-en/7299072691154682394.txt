0:0:23|0:0:33|On a windy night in the month of May, a group of people holding torches were shouting loudly, chasing after a young couple holding a child ahead of them.
0:0:41|0:1:1|The young man furrowed his brow, looked down at the two children in his arms, and as the crowd behind them closed in, he hurriedly handed one of the children to his wife. Feeling overwhelmed by the situation before him, the young man was momentarily at a loss. His wife glanced at him, then at the child, and choked out, "..."
0:1:3|0:1:26|The gears of destiny quietly turned at this moment, and 30 years had passed in the blink of an eye. The scene shifted to a picturesque village. In the distance, the sound of singing could be heard, sung by a man in a white tank top, named [Zhu Xiangquan]. The man beside him cleared his throat and began to speak.
0:1:51|0:1:59|Qiao Xiu put down the basket in her hand and squatted down next to [Zhu Xiangquan]. On the other side, the smartly dressed female assistant [Cai Yafen] said to the boss [Zhao Yinquan].
0:2:6|0:2:15|Upon hearing this, [Cai Yafen] put away her smile and walked out thoughtfully. In the meeting room, a man in a suit handed the documents to [Cai Yafen] and spoke.
0:2:29|0:2:33|The villagers gather around [the village chief] to study the documents in front of them.
0:3:34|0:3:43|The scene shifts, [Cai Yafen] wearing high heels, briskly follows [Village Chief] walking towards the mountains, with two accompanying personnel conducting on-site inspections behind them.
0:4:13|0:4:15|After the assessment, [Cai Yafen] returned home.
0:4:25|0:4:27|[Cai Yafen] hesitated for a moment, then continued speaking.
0:4:47|0:4:52|Cousin [Meimei] came down from upstairs and sat next to [Cai Yafen], speaking up.
0:5:15|0:5:19|In the village, [Zhu Xiangquan] ran to the door of a household and shouted.
0:6:8|0:6:19|He pouted with a look of grievance, slowly walking backwards. The [Village Chief] watched him leave, glanced back at his own yard, and then left as well. On the other side, [Cai Yafen] brought [Meimei] to the coffee shop.
0:6:42|0:6:45|[Meimei] looked at him helplessly and said.
0:6:51|0:7:0|Night falls, a woman walks towards the door of [Zhu Xiangquan]'s house and calls out. [Zhu Xiangquan] then comes out with his mother.
0:7:7|0:7:20|Mom glanced at [Zhu Xiangquan] and walked towards the door. Seeing this, [Zhu Xiangquan] could only reluctantly turn back home. On the other side, [Cai Yafen] drove to a beautiful small villa. This was [Zhao Yinquan]'s home, and he opened the door and said.
0:7:29|0:7:32|[Meimei] followed [Cai Yafen] into the room.
0:8:1|0:8:18|[Cai Yafen] watched as [Zhao Yingquan]'s mother left, gradually retracting her smile. At that moment, [Zhao Yingquan] approached. He handed the tea to [Meimei] and looked at her, asking.
0:9:4|0:9:15|Watching the two people chatting happily in front of her, [Cai Yafen] quickly sent [Zhao Yinquan] away. As night fell, the scene shifted to [Zhu Xiangquan]'s home, where he sat on the kang with his mother, absent-mindedly eating dinner.
0:9:15|0:9:25|The mother looked at [Zhu Xiangquan], who had a troubled expression on his face, sighed, then picked up some vegetables and put them in his bowl. Seeing him still looking troubled, she spoke up.
0:9:44|0:9:50|On the other side, the North Xinjiang Group, [Cai Yafen], leaned back in the chair, casually watching [Director Wang] beside her, and asked.
0:10:27|0:10:31|[Director Wang] stood up with his arms crossed and said solemnly.
0:10:41|0:10:44|[Cai Yafen] stood up immediately and spoke.
0:11:14|0:11:33|While the two of them were secretly plotting, the simple-minded [Zhu Xiangquan] felt that he was being treated unfairly, so he, being single-minded, went to the city to seek justice. Looking at the bustling streets in front of him, [Zhu Xiangquan], who didn't know the way, found himself in trouble. But he didn't expect that the passersby completely ignored him.
0:11:37|0:11:43|[Zhuxiang Quan] ignored him after asking twice in a row, and the journey to Beijiang Group was not as easy as he had imagined.
0:11:43|0:11:59|On the other side, rural girl [Jiang Xiu] sat on a pile of soil, watching a number of excavators working simultaneously in front of her, burying tons of garbage, looking worried. The air was filled with dust, the sky turned gray, and garbage piled up all over the mountains, emitting a strong stench.
0:12:0|0:12:19|The once beautiful mountain valley has now changed beyond recognition. On the other side, [Zhu Xiangquan] of the Beijiang Group, who has not been found yet, is standing in front of a faucet, drinking water greedily. After finishing the drink, he twists open a plastic bottle in his hand, fills it with water, then slings his backpack over his shoulder without stopping, and continues on his way.
0:12:19|0:12:26|In the library, [Meimei] was bowing her head and searching for books, when [Zhang Yingquan] suddenly walked out from behind the bookshelf and appeared in front of her, whispering.
0:12:29|0:12:41|[Meimei] looked up and saw [Zhao Yingquan] smiling with surprise, waving at her. She quickly put the book back on the shelf. She glanced back and didn't see [Cai Yafen], who followed along, fidgeting.
0:12:41|0:12:57|Sitting by the window, [Cai Yafen] was engrossed in reading when her phone rang. She picked up the phone and saw a message from [Meimei], saying she had to leave early. Looking down from the window, [Cai Yafen] was surprised to see [Meimei] and [Zhao Yingquan] walking out of the library hand in hand.
0:13:24|0:13:28|[Meimei] and [Zhao Yingquan] hit it off at first sight, and their feelings quickly escalate.
0:14:53|0:15:8|[Cai Yafen]'s actions received a round of applause. Late at night, [Zhao Yinquan] returned home and buried himself in work. His mother stood at the door, watching her son with a heart full of tenderness. She pushed the door open and walked in, then lowered her head to speak to [Zhao Yinquan].
0:15:22|0:15:35|He looked at his son, hesitated to speak, sighed, rubbed his hands, but in the end, he didn't say anything. He turned around and walked towards the door. Halfway there, he stopped, turned back, and spoke to [Zhao Yinquan].
0:15:39|0:15:56|Upon hearing [Zhao Yinquan]'s words, the mother nodded with a smile, looked at her son who was still working, turned around and silently left. She paused at the door for a moment, glanced back inside, and ultimately swallowed the words on the tip of her tongue, closed the door, and left.
0:15:56|0:16:9|Early the next morning, [Ma Dongmei] came downstairs with a heavy heart, holding a package in her hands. She sat down next to her husband, who was reading the newspaper in the living room. The man looked up at his wife and then at the package in her hands, puzzled, and asked.
0:17:10|0:17:15|On the other side of the company, [Zhang Yingquan] held the financial report in his hand and said to [Cai Yafen].
0:17:36|0:17:38|[Zhao Yingquan] dropped the report in his hand and sighed.
0:18:3|0:18:12|Reluctant [Zhao Yinquan] pursed his lips and continued working. On the other side, [Cai Yafen] returned to the office, slammed the file on the table, and shouted at [Director Wang].
0:18:40|0:18:51|Upon hearing this, [Director Wang] was frightened and quickly walked forward. Yafen, [Cai Yafen], closed her eyes, looking impatient.
0:18:52|0:18:57|Director Wang looked at Cai Yafen, who had closed her eyes and remained silent, and after a moment of silence, he reluctantly spoke.
0:19:2|0:19:21|After finishing speaking, [Director Wang] took three steps back and walked out without giving up. Only then did [Cai Yafen] slowly raise her head and open her eyes. As she walked out of the office, stood up, picked up the phone on the desk, dialed a number, put it to her ear, and patiently waited. In the hospital on the other end, the phone rang.
0:19:37|0:19:56|Hello? [Cai Yafen] hesitated for a moment and then spoke. After receiving a positive response, [Cai Yafen] revealed a strange smile, her eyes rolled, she snorted coldly, her expression gradually becoming sinister, as if she was up to no good.
0:19:58|0:20:14|The scene cuts to the agreed day, a cruise ship slowly approaches from a distance, with [Meimei] and [Cai Yafen] standing at the front of the ship. The cruise ship quickly reaches the shore, and the two of them disembark with the crowd and arrive at a temple.
0:20:14|0:20:26|In the temple filled with incense, [Meimei] and [Cai Yafen] arrived in front of a Buddha statue. They put their hands together, closed their eyes tightly, silently prayed for what they desired in their hearts, then bowed and left.
0:20:28|0:20:32|Soon after, the two of them arrived at a stone sculpture, where a tour guide introduced.
0:20:53|0:20:58|With the sound of clicking cameras, the camera behind captured the scene of the tour guide with ulterior motives approaching [Meimei]. On the other side, [Zhu Xiangquan] arrived at the company's entrance.
0:21:25|0:21:28|[Cai Yafen] hurriedly arrived at the door afterwards.
0:22:3|0:22:11|[Cai Yafen] looked [Zhu Xiangquan] up and down, then furrowed her brows. [Director Wang] led [Zhu Xiangquan] to the side and pointed at his nose to speak.
0:22:38|0:22:48|Angry [Zhu Xiangquan] punched [Director Wang] in the face, while on the other side, unaware [Zhao Yingquan] was still meditating in the car. The driver looked at him and asked.
0:22:53|0:23:3|On the winding and twisting Yangchang Road, a car passing by raised the dust on the ground. Accompanied by the buzzing roar of the car, [Zhang Yingquan] arrived at Yanling Village.
0:23:6|0:23:18|The car stopped, and he walked to a small river, bent down to stir the water, then cupped some water in his palm, sniffed it in front of his nose. [Zhao Yingquan] frowned as he detected an unusual smell.
0:23:18|0:23:33|Suddenly hearing a buzzing sound in the distance, he looked over and saw a working excavator in the mountain valley far away, surrounded by large piles of garbage. He stood up and walked towards the garbage dump, arriving at the office where a staff member spoke.
0:23:47|0:23:52|Zhang Yingquan stood up after speaking, and with his hands behind his back, he pondered for a moment before speaking.
0:23:58|0:24:4|The construction site supervisor kept his head down in silence, [Zhang Yiquan] snorted coldly and turned away. Seeing this, the supervisor lifted his head and spoke.
0:24:22|0:24:32|[Zhao Yingquan] looked at the person in charge angrily, then turned and walked towards the door without a word. When he reached the door, he turned back and pointed at the person in charge.
0:24:32|0:24:47|In the park on the other side, a man wearing sunglasses walked out from behind the rockery, stood still, and waved to the side. Another man in a floral shirt walked out from behind the rockery, waved his hand, and then three young men walked out. He pointed to [Zhu Xiangquan] and spoke to the others.
0:24:50|0:24:55|The three young men who received the order turned and ran down to [Zhu Xiangquan], and spoke.
0:25:5|0:25:20|A few young men quickly gave [Zhu Xiangquan] a beating, causing him to fall to the ground in pain and screaming. Soon after, an ambulance arrived and took him to the hospital. He lay unconscious on a stretcher as several medical staff pushed him into the operating room.
0:25:20|0:25:27|The surgical light turned on, [Doctor] put on gloves and picked up the scalpel, then shaved his head, preparing for the craniotomy.
0:25:28|0:25:47|On the other side, [Zhao Yingquan] left Yanling Village and encountered a landslide on the way home, blocked by falling rocks from the mountain. The car stopped, and [Zhao Yingquan] got out with the driver to inspect the situation. Looking at the rocks on the ground, he said to the driver.
0:25:47|0:25:55|[Zhao Yingquan] and the driver, who had rolled up their sleeves and taken off their shoes, worked together to lift the stones. Just as they had cleared away several large rocks, Zhu Xiangquan's mother appeared.
0:25:56|0:26:15|She looked at the stones falling on the road, put down the basket in her hand, and also helped to move them. As she was moving, Zhu's mother saw [Zhao Yingquan] in front of her. She stared at [Zhao Yingquan] for a long time, and hesitantly spoke. Ah Quan, [Zhao Yingquan] looked at the woman in front of him with confusion.
0:26:33|0:26:37|The woman was dumbfounded when she heard this, looking at [Zhao Yingquan] in disbelief.
0:26:54|0:27:4|He looked at [Zhao Yingquan] again. He stared at [Zhao Yingquan] with wide eyes and said.
0:27:17|0:27:33|After he finished speaking, he left in a daze. [Zhao Yingquan] watched his departing figure in confusion, then squatted down and picked up a stone. Suddenly, a large rock fell from the mountain and hit him directly on the head.
0:27:33|0:27:43|Here, [Zhao Yingquan] was knocked unconscious by a stone, while in the hospital on the other side, Zhu Xiangquan, who had just undergone surgery, shaved his head bald with bandages wrapped around it, lying unconscious on the hospital bed.
0:27:45|0:27:58|As a nurse, [Meimei] entered the ward to change the medicine. Just after finishing, she turned around to leave but accidentally saw the person on the bed. She immediately walked up, looked at the person on the bed in shock, widened her eyes, and quickly took off her mask.
0:28:2|0:28:22|After speaking, she hurried to the end of the bed to look at the medical record card. The name column clearly read "阿全", mistakenly thinking this person was Zhao Yingquan's Meimei, she was now in a panic. Meimei, who couldn't rest assured, went to the rooftop and took out her phone, dialing the number of Cai Yafen who was far away in the company, and spoke seriously.
0:28:40|0:28:46|[Cai Yafen] frowned, looking at [Zhu Xiangquan] with a worried expression, while [Zhu Xiangquan] saw Qiaoxiu in a daze.
0:28:51|0:28:58|[Zhuxiangquan], who slowly opened his eyes, finally saw that the person standing in front of him was not Qiuxiu, but [Meimei] whom he had never seen before.
0:29:7|0:29:13|[Meimei] glanced at [Cai Yafen]. [Cai Yafen] spoke up and asked.
0:29:47|0:29:55|Up until now, I have only loved one person, [Meimei] said with tears in her eyes.
0:29:56|0:30:7|After speaking, he glanced at [Cai Yafen] sitting next to him, then looked at [Zhu Xiangquan] lying on the bed, sighed sadly, and left. [Zhu Xiangquan] was puzzled and asked [Cai Yafen].
0:30:8|0:30:15|Hearing this, [Cai Yafen] sneered and remained silent. Meanwhile, the real [Zhao Yingquan] had already returned home.
0:30:27|0:30:31|[Zhang Ying] just lowered her head and remained silent after listening, at this moment her father walked in.
0:31:59|0:32:9|The mother of [Zhao Yingquan], who heard the question, glanced at her husband, then lowered her head, seeming hesitant, as if she wanted to speak but stopped. [Zhao Yingquan] looked at the two of them in confusion.
0:32:27|0:32:53|It all started thirty years ago. Your dad and I had two classmates, a girl named [Zhu Qiushui] and a boy named [Zhang Shaobai]. Fast forward to thirty years ago, a young girl found a baby at her doorstep. They always carried two identical school bags.
0:32:55|0:33:23|Later, Zhu Qiushui combined the last character of their names and embroidered two identical "quan" characters on their schoolbags. However, Zhu Qiushui's family looked down on Zhang Shaobai's family for being too poor, and adamantly refused to agree to their lifelong commitment, secretly giving birth to a pair of twins.
0:33:26|0:33:38|The medical conditions were too poor. Shortly after giving birth, [Zhu Qiushui] passed away due to illness.
0:33:46|0:34:4|At this point, the father walked in from outside with a serious expression, not saying a word, and handed a school bag embroidered with the character "全" to [Zhao Yingquan]. [Zhao Yingquan] immediately stood up, trembling hands taking the school bag and carefully examining it, as if losing strength, he slumped back into the chair.
0:34:17|0:34:26|Hearing this, [Zhao Yingquan] burst into tears and knelt down in front of his father with a thud.
0:34:47|0:34:49|The scene shifts to a hospital.
0:35:13|0:35:19|Upon hearing this, [Meimei] lowered her head in contemplation. Outside the Holiday Hotel, a car pulled up to the entrance, and [Cai Yafen] led [Zhu Xiangquan] inside.
0:35:55|0:35:58|[Zhu Xiangquan] curiously feels the soft sofa.
0:36:20|0:36:27|In the Beijiang Group, [Zhang Yingquan] returned to the office and as soon as he opened the door, he saw a letter lying on the ground. He bent down to pick up the letter.
0:36:28|0:36:43|After closing the door, she walked while opening the envelope. However, the contents inside made her face change. Inside was a photo of [Meimei] and the male tour guide together when they visited the temple that day. Due to the angle, [Meimei] and the man appeared particularly intimate.
0:36:43|0:36:49|She quickly flipped through the photos in the envelope, growing angrier with each one, and finally slammed the photos down on the table.
0:36:51|0:37:10|Sitting down on the sofa in frustration, breathing heavily, [Meimei] fell silent for a moment, feeling as if she had been stabbed with a sharp blade, closing her eyes and collapsing on the sofa. On the other side, mistaking Zhu Xiangquan for Zhao Yingquan, [Meimei] recalled the words she said in the hospital during the day, realizing that her lover actually loved someone else.
0:37:10|0:37:19|She picked up the apple in front of her with a look of melancholy, biting into it with a vacant expression, as if pondering something. Suddenly, she picked up the phone on the table and dialed Zhao Yingquan's number.
0:37:25|0:37:40|Zhao Yinquan, who is still working here, is in a bad mood. When he sees a call from [Meimei], he doesn't pay attention and puts it aside. He looks at the constantly ringing phone in silence for a moment, finally sighs, still doesn't answer, pretends not to see it, and continues working.
0:37:40|0:37:43|[Meimei] saw that no one answered the phone, sighed, and sadly lowered her head.
0:37:46|0:38:3|Night falls, as Zhao Yingquan drives home after work, he hears the ringing of his phone again. He looks down and sees it's [Meimei], but he still ignores her because of the photo incident. Unable to reach him on the phone, [Meimei] angrily throws her phone down and takes a bite of an apple, venting her frustration and dissatisfaction.
0:38:6|0:38:26|Faced with a series of blows, the distressed Zhao Yinquan came to a restaurant alone to drown his sorrows. The one who caused this misunderstanding is none other than the instigator [Cai Yafen]. She has admired [Zhao Yinquan] for a long time, and [Zhao Yinquan] met his cousin [Meimei] through her. The two hit it off immediately and their feelings quickly intensified.
0:38:26|0:38:30|So she felt jealous and had someone take a photo to send to [Zhao Yinquan] in order to frame [Meimei].
0:38:35|0:38:49|At this moment, [Cai Yafen] has achieved her goal, as a misunderstanding has caused a rift between [Zhao Yingquan] and [Meimei]. With the pouring rain outside, [Zhao Yingquan] reminisces about the good times they once had together.
0:38:49|0:39:1|Thinking back to the photos seen during the day, [Zhao Yingquan] felt like his heart was being twisted by a knife. His intimate lover betrayed him, and his parents with whom he spent day and night actually had no blood relation with him. He was picked up by his foster parents after being abandoned by others.
0:39:2|0:39:9|Love and family, [Zhao Yingquan] who has been deeply hurt, feels sadder the more he thinks about it.
0:39:9|0:39:24|[Zhao Yingquan], who is heavily drunk, braves the heavy rain and staggers out of the restaurant. He reaches the car but can't open the door. He then stumbles onto the street, rain beating down on him, but he pays no attention. He drunkenly embraces passing vehicles.
0:39:35|0:39:51|Unable to catch a cab, [Zhao Yingquan] dashed recklessly on the road, aimlessly. Suddenly, a strong urge to vomit drove him to the roadside. Under the influence of alcohol and the pouring rain, he lost his way, accidentally slipped and tumbled down the hill.
0:40:1|0:40:4|The father and son couldn't reach [赵颖泉] and, with no other options, they stood in the son's room looking at each other helplessly, sighed, and left empty-handed.
0:40:21|0:40:33|Early the next morning, a homeless man in a torn short-sleeved shirt was standing in front of a trash can, picking up recyclable garbage. He picked up a bottle with his left hand, a can with his right hand, looking very pleased with his findings.
0:40:33|0:40:48|He looked around, searching for other useful things. In the distance, he saw something in the mud pit, but he didn't pay much attention to it. Just as he was about to turn and leave, he turned back and took a closer look. There, lying in the mud pit, was the person who had fallen last night, [Zhao Yingquan].
0:40:49|0:41:0|The homeless man was startled, dropped the bag full of plastic bottles in his hand, and hurriedly ran towards [Zhao Yingquan]. He squatted down, patted [Zhao Yingquan] on the shoulder, and spoke.
0:41:17|0:41:34|The homeless man couldn't wake up [Zhao Yingquan] no matter what he did. Not knowing what had happened, he had to drag him out of the pit first. But [Zhao Yingquan], who was unconscious, was too heavy. After falling a few times, the homeless man finally managed to carry him on his back with great effort, step by step, up the hill.
0:42:13|0:42:20|Thinking of this, [Director Wang] casually walked up to the two of them and asked a few probing questions as if by accident.
0:43:13|0:43:21|In the company, [Cai Yafen] learned about the matter and confidently said. [Director Wang] walked up from behind her and spoke.
0:43:31|0:43:34|In the KTV, a beautiful woman poured a glass of wine for Zhu Xiangquan sitting next to her.
0:43:57|0:44:10|The next morning, Zhu Xiangquan, who had drunk himself unconscious, woke up from his slumber, as if still carrying the fishy taste of his dreams. The sunlight shining on his face stung his eyes, and when he first opened them, there was still a sense of confusion.
0:44:10|0:44:22|After a struggle, he finally woke up, but when he looked down, he was shocked to find that he was not wearing any clothes. And to his surprise, there was a girl lying next to him.
0:45:27|0:45:29|[Cai Yafen] looked at him with a mysterious gaze.
0:46:3|0:46:18|In Yanling Village, an old man is herding ducks by the river, but suddenly the ducks become listless and stagger to the ground. As the old man takes a closer look, he sees another duck lying on the ground. He looks at the two suddenly dead ducks and shouts anxiously.
0:46:57|0:47:2|On the other side, Zhu Xiangquan followed [Cai Yafen]'s arrangement and walked out in a suit similar to Zhao Yunquan's.
0:47:3|0:47:5|Zhu Xiangquan looked at the two in confusion and asked. He furrowed his brow and twisted his arms.
0:47:33|0:47:51|In the library, [Meimei] sat by the window, looking out with moist eyes, appearing burdened with worries. Suddenly, as if losing strength, she slowly lowered the hand supporting her face, weakly resting it on the table without saying a word, just lost in thoughts. After a while, she closed her eyes as if resigning to fate.
0:47:56|0:48:12|At dusk, the amnesiac [Zhao Ying] carried a large bag on his back, picking up trash on the roadside, with the homeless man who saved him following behind. At this moment, [Meimei], who was still daydreaming in the library, finally couldn't hold back anymore, falling into an emotional abyss, tears falling like beads off a broken string.
0:48:19|0:48:33|[Zhao Yinquan] and [Ma Dongmei] walked to the restaurant where the incident happened. Looking at the familiar scene in front of them, [Zhao Yinquan] felt a sharp pain in his head. He walked while holding his head with his hand, unable to stop calling out. The homeless man supported him and looked at him with concern, saying.
0:49:6|0:49:20|The homeless man comfortingly patted [Zhao Yingquan]'s head, then stood up, looked around, and left. [Zhao Yingquan] sat alone by the roadside, obediently waiting for the homeless man to return with water.
0:49:20|0:49:31|On the other side, [Zhu Xiangquan] was imitating [Zhao Yingquan]'s handwriting with a pen, practicing his signature in the notebook. Sitting beside him, [Cai Yafen] picked up the notebook and flipped through it, then smiled satisfactorily and said.
0:49:44|0:49:56|The scene shifts, [Zhu Xiangquan] dressed in a suit and pretending to be [Zhao Yingquan], arrives at the company. Employees stand on both sides clapping and welcoming. [Zhu Xiangquan] nods and smiles in a decent manner.
0:50:2|0:50:12|In the village of Yanling on the other side, an old man hurriedly walked out with ointment and handed it to the village chief sitting at the door.
0:50:31|0:50:36|The old man frowned at these words. Turning around, the two of them arrived at the county hospital.
0:51:4|0:51:23|They walked into the hospital with a bottle of river water and handed the medicine to the doctor. The two of them sat on chairs in the corridor waiting for the results. The old man tilted his head, curiously looking around. The doctor in charge of testing the samples in the hospital quickly came to a conclusion after a series of meticulous tests.
0:51:23|0:51:26|A doctor holding a report looks at the two people in the corridor and says.
0:51:36|0:51:46|The two characters who got the results returned to the village dejectedly. According to the test results, nearly ten trace elements such as lead and chromium were found to exceed the standard in the water.
0:51:54|0:52:11|Understanding that everything is related to the river, the two of them came to the riverbank. The old man squatted by the river, looking at the withered plants. He reached out and pulled a piece down, held it in his hand and carefully examined it, then held it up to his nose to smell. In the blink of an eye, he saw the dead fish in the river.
0:53:24|0:53:30|The village chief alliance took out a report from the bag, and [Director Wang] frowned as he looked at the report in his hand.
0:54:24|0:54:34|A luxury car drove by, from which [Zhu Xiangquan] and [Cai Yafen] got off. Through the car window, they saw [Zhao Yunquan]'s parents standing under a tree, reaching for something.
0:54:56|0:55:12|After speaking, [Zhu Xiangquan] handed the briefcase to [Cai Yafen] beside him. He picked up a stick and jumped a few times, but couldn't reach, so he took off the ring from his hand, unbuttoned his shirt, took off his suit jacket, and handed it to [Cai Yafen].
0:55:31|0:55:51|[Zhu Xiangquan] was like a nimble monkey, quickly climbing up the tree and reaching out to grab the garbage bag hanging on a branch. With a joyful smile, he bunched up the plastic bag in his hand and threw it to his father standing below the tree before climbing back down shortly after.
0:55:51|0:55:55|The three people under the tree looked at him nervously.
0:56:0|0:56:2|On the other side, the village chief, who was unable to solve the problem, called [Director Wang] and waited solemnly for the other end to pick up the phone.
0:57:14|0:57:24|Here, the old men from the village came to the construction site with shovels in a domineering manner. The security guard at the gate, [Er Gouzi], saw Zhao Wenliang and immediately closed the gate, stepping aside and saying.
0:57:35|0:57:55|Speak up, [Er Gouzi] looked at the crowd in the distance, suddenly remembered something, took out a lock from his pocket, and quickly went forward to lock the door. The next second, the villagers arrived at the door shouting.
0:58:55|0:59:6|The enraged villagers picked up their sticks and shovels and began to smash the door. [Er Gouzi] huddled up, and at that moment, the [village chief] walked out from the crowd.
0:59:39|0:59:46|[Director Wang] hung up the phone, picked up the test report in his hand, and found [Cai Yafen]. [Cai Yafen] looked at the report with a furrowed brow.
1:0:9|1:0:15|[After Cai Yafen finished speaking, she turned around and left, leaving Director Wang at a loss.]
1:0:50|1:1:3|[Zhuxiang Quan], who had a nightmare, was suddenly scared into a cold sweat, and impatiently unbuttoned his shirt. Still shaken, he picked up the glass of water on the table and drank it down to calm his nerves. Suddenly, the phone on the table rang.
1:1:14|1:1:30|[Cai Yafen], unable to get through on the phone, furrowed her brow. At this moment, the house was empty, with only a suit left on the sofa and a phone constantly ringing on the beads. Meanwhile, [Zhu Xiangquan] had already sneaked out, leaving [Director Wang] who couldn't find anyone, angrily scolding the guard.
1:1:45|1:1:48|[Chaya Fen] took out a stack of banknotes from her bag and handed them to the two people.
1:2:16|1:2:22|The very venomous [Cai Yafen] along with the cunning [Director Wang], the two of them are full of bad intentions, who knows what mischief they are up to again.
1:2:23|1:2:43|In the dead of night, the amnesiac [Zhao Yingquan] appeared alone by the river. With heavy steps, he walked forward in a daze. His eyes were lifeless, lost in thought. Suddenly, a thug appeared behind him, covering [Zhao Yingquan]'s mouth with a cloth. He struggled for a moment before being knocked unconscious.
1:2:43|1:3:7|Two more thugs appeared and carried the unconscious [Zhao Yingquan] away together. The scene shifted to a construction site, where a car with its lights on slowly approached. Inside the house, [Zhang Yingquan] was tied up to a chair. The door opened, and the leader walked in wearing a pair of delicate high heels. As the camera slowly panned up, the person was none other than [Cai Yafen].
1:3:7|1:3:12|She approached [Zhang Yingquan] with a sinister look on her face. [Zhang Yingquan] looked up at her.
1:3:45|1:3:48|Due to love turning into hatred, [Cai Yafen] gasped heavily, glaring fiercely at [Zhang Yingquan]. Zhang Yiquan looked at [Cai Yafen], her face blank as she couldn't remember anything, then slowly lowered her head into contemplation.
1:4:16|1:4:20|Early the next morning, the long-lost [Zhu Xiangquan] returned home.
1:4:41|1:5:1|The woman who hasn't seen her son for a long time excitedly held [Zhu Xiangquan]'s hand and helped him onto a chair. On the other side, poor [Zhao Yingquan] was still tied to a chair, sitting there and sleeping all night. The sunlight shone on his face, stinging his eyes. After being tied up all night, [Zhao Yingquan] painfully opened his eyes.
1:5:1|1:5:4|Suddenly, some images appeared in his mind.
1:5:31|1:5:38|After recalling his identity, [Zhao Yingquan] couldn't bear the shock, his head ached unbearably, and the next second he passed out.
1:5:40|1:5:53|At night, a worker came to open the door, holding a bowl of rice and walked in. He closed the door, looked at the sleeping [Zhao Yunquan], walked up to him, put the food aside, patted him, and spoke.
1:6:41|1:6:44|The supervisor here is named [Zhou Lianfu].
1:6:57|1:7:12|[Zhao Yingquan] watched the departing worker with mixed feelings in his heart, only withdrawing his gaze after the worker had left. He looked around the room helplessly, sighing deeply, pinning his hopes on the worker who had just left.
1:7:12|1:7:25|Suddenly lowering his head into contemplation, the construction site at night was still operating smoothly, with no one noticing [Zhao Yingquan] inside the small black house on the factory premises. Before long, the door of the small black house opened, and [Zhou Lianfu] walked in.
1:8:3|1:8:10|Taking advantage of the night, the two of them used the pillars in the area as cover, hiding from the crowd.
1:8:10|1:8:24|Following the escape route of [Zhou Lianfu], the two arrived at a large truck. [Zhang Yingquan] stepped on [Zhou Lianfu]'s shoulders, pushed hard, and climbed onto the roof of the truck to hide. As the sky began to light up, the truck drove to the entrance of the construction site.
1:8:24|1:8:32|The old man who opened the door at the entrance stood up when he saw the familiar vehicle. The negligent security guard didn't do much inspection and opened the gate to the construction site.
1:8:33|1:8:50|With the start of the truck, [Zhao Yingquan] hidden on the roof finally managed to escape from the den of demons. After the vehicle left, the old man tightly closed the gate of the construction site. The vehicle drove on the deserted street. The truck, which should have been unobstructed all the way, suddenly came to a stop.
1:8:50|1:8:56|The driver in the car parked the car, opened the door, got out of the car, holding his stomach, and hurriedly looked for a place to relieve himself.
1:8:57|1:9:7|Upon hearing the sound of the door closing, [Zhang Yingquan] slowly poked his head out from the roof of the car, took a look around, and this time, the cautious [Zhang Yingquan] who had narrowly escaped disaster appeared particularly careful.
1:9:7|1:9:18|After making sure the driver had gone far away, she seized the opportunity to take the next step. Slowly, she turned her body to the side and carefully climbed down from the roof of the car, afraid of being discovered, not daring to make any sudden movements.
1:9:19|1:9:31|After getting down, he didn't recklessly leave immediately, but cautiously hid behind the car to observe the surroundings, making sure there were no suspicious individuals far from the factory before quickly running away.
1:9:31|1:9:45|Exhausted [Zhao Yinquan], who successfully escaped, staggered to a bathhouse with heavy steps. He looked up and walked in. The attendant at the door immediately greeted him.
1:9:45|1:9:56|After [Zhuangyingquan] emerged from the bath center, he looked radiant and all signs of his previous disheveled appearance were gone. He had changed into a clean and sharp suit, striding confidently towards the exit.
1:9:57|1:10:10|On the other side of the hotel, [Director Wang] was still mingling privately with [Cai Yafen]. Suddenly, a ringing phone interrupted them. [Director Wang] crawled out of bed, leaned on the edge of the bed, and frantically searched for his phone in the scattered clothes pockets.
1:10:54|1:10:57|[Zhao Yunquan] has lost his memory.
1:11:11|1:11:26|Early the next morning, [Cai Yafen] and [Director Wang] hurried to the office, frantically destroying various documents. [Cai Yafen] sat in front of the computer, expressionless as she deleted the Yanling Project files, while [Director Wang] checked various reports nearby.
1:11:26|1:11:38|At this moment, [Zhao Yingquan] had a determined look on his face as he walked with firm steps to a telephone booth, inserted a phone card, and dialed a series of numbers. On the other end, [Cai Yafen], who was still destroying documents, answered the phone.
1:11:56|1:12:11|Upon hearing the words of [Zhao Yinquan], [Cai Yafen] widened her eyes in shock, trembling as she asked. [Zhao Yinquan] hung up the phone directly, leaving [Cai Yafen] with a pale face, trembling as she stood up unsteadily.
1:12:20|1:12:29|On the other side, [Zhu Xiangquan] returned to the village and went to Qiaoxiu's house, handing the photo to Qiaoxiu and confessing her mistake. After looking at the photo, Qiaoxiu stared at her in disbelief.
1:13:23|1:13:45|After a big argument, Qiaoxiu, feeling resentful, stomped on the bricks just laid by [Zhu Xiangquan], and threw his tools. [Zhu Xiangquan] didn't say a word, silently picked up his tools. Qiaoxiu finished speaking, her eyes moistened, but [Zhu Xiangquan] still remained silent.
1:13:53|1:14:3|Xiaoxiu, despite saying she wouldn't be soft-hearted, had tears all over her face. She gently sobbed as she squatted down, looking at [Zhu Xiangquan]'s face without saying a word, just silently shedding tears.
1:14:4|1:14:18|He looked on, reminiscing about their past happiness. He couldn't understand why [Zhu Xiangquan] had changed so much after just being away for a few days. He bit his lip, as if wanting to say something. After lowering his head in silence for a long time, he ultimately couldn't speak.
1:14:18|1:14:31|In the end, feeling utterly wronged and with nowhere to vent, he grabbed a handful of mud from the ground and threw it at [Zhu Xiangquan]'s head. But [Zhu Xiangquan] still didn't react. And so, handful after handful of mud rained down on him.
1:14:38|1:14:52|On this side, [Zhu Xiangquan] and [Zhao Yingquan] have not reconciled yet. On the other side, the neatly dressed [Zhao Yingquan] hesitated for a moment at the entrance of the library, but eventually chose to walk in.
1:14:52|1:15:0|Walking through the corridor, she arrived at the spot where [Meimei] often sat. As expected, she was still there. [Zhaoyingquan] walked up to [Meimei] and placed a photo on her book.
1:15:10|1:15:33|[Meimei] opened the envelope and saw a photo of herself and the tour guide inside. The content of the photo left her incredulous, and she looked up in astonishment. To avoid disturbing others in the library, the two of them went to the rooftop. [Zhao Yingquan] stood silently with his hands behind his back at the edge of the rooftop, waiting for [Meimei] to explain.
1:15:33|1:15:37|[Meimei] walked over from behind with a photo in her hand, standing next to [Zhao Yingquan] and looking at him.
1:15:40|1:15:50|He put his arm around [Meimei]'s shoulder, led her to sit on the chair, and then earnestly said to [Meimei].
1:17:34|1:17:45|[Zhang Yiquan] and [Meimei] finally cleared up their misunderstanding and reconciled. On the other side, [Qiaoxiu] watched [Zhu Xiangquan] sweeping the floor, unable to suppress her emotions, she rushed towards him and hugged him.
1:17:54|1:18:0|[Xiaoxiu] tightly hugged [Zhu Xiangquan] and chose to forgive him, while [Meimei] and [Zhang Yingquan] also went back home together.
1:19:7|1:19:24|In a blink of an eye, [Zhao Yingquan] drove the car and brought his parents and [Meimei] to Yanling Village. The car stopped by the roadside, and the family of four got off the car with smiles on their faces, eagerly. After getting off the car, [Zhao Yingquan's mother] took a few steps forward, looked around, and sighed at the green mountains and trees beside her.
1:19:42|1:19:49|But no one would have expected that there was also a great crisis.
1:20:19|1:20:33|Hearing the familiar name of Yanling Village, [Zhao Yingquan's mother] was visibly stunned. Thinking about Zhao Yingquan's background, she glanced at her husband, hesitated for a moment, and then followed along with a hesitant expression. The group walked slowly towards Yanling Village.
1:20:33|1:20:48|Upon entering the village, the first thing that catches the eye is a towering old tree in the center of the village, although ancient, the tree crown is sprouting new shoots, showing vigorous vitality, like an old person who has experienced many hardships, still guarding the entire village through wind and rain.
1:20:49|1:21:3|Several people looked up at the ancient tree, which, against the backdrop of the ancient tree, had turned into an elephant-like size. The window ancient tree came to the [Zhu Xiangquan's house], and several people sat around, with [Zhu Xiangquan's mother] speaking first.
1:21:29|1:21:35|[Mrs. Zhang Yingquan] held her hand after hearing it, trembling, tears falling down heavily.
1:22:55|1:23:1|[Mrs. Zhu Xiangquan] looked at them blankly, shook her head, and then let out a heavy sigh.
1:23:10|1:23:16|At this point, several adults were already in tears, lamenting the plight of [Zhang Shaobai].
1:23:24|1:23:39|Upon hearing this, [Zhao Yingquan] looked up at her, only to see the tear-streaked woman bowing her head in silence, then smiling as if in resignation. The scene shifts to [Zhao Yingquan] kneeling in front of a tombstone, choking out a cry.
1:23:41|1:23:57|Then trembling, he kowtowed heavily three times in front of the grave. Seeing this scene, the people around couldn't help but shed tears one after another. [Zhao Yingquan] knelt on the ground, picked up a handful of soil, and gently covered it on his mother's grave.
1:23:57|1:24:10|After adding the soil, [Zhao Yingquan] knelt in front of the grave, quietly looking at her mother's tombstone. At this moment, she couldn't care less about whether a man sheds tears or not, and she couldn't stop choking. Every time I see [Zhao Yingquan] like this, it's heart-wrenching.
1:27:21|1:27:33|Good and evil will be rewarded, Cai Yafen and others have been punished by the law, and everything in the village has returned to normal, showing a thriving atmosphere.
