0:1:27|0:1:49|On the battlefield, amidst a vast expanse of yellow sand, the two armies had been facing off for quite some time. On one side stood the heavily armored Qing dynasty soldiers, while on the other side was a group of fearless warriors with white headscarves - the followers of the Heavenly Principles Sect. Today, the Heavenly Principles Sect commanded tens of thousands of soldiers, rampaging through the capital and the surrounding areas with great momentum. Among these soldiers, there was a peculiar individual who would later become a grandmaster in the martial arts world.
0:1:49|0:2:0|Describing him as a weirdo is not an exaggeration at all. While the battlefield is filled with smoke, he remains standing in place, engrossed in watching ants building their nests. Suddenly, a comrade throws a long spear towards the weirdo.
0:2:6|0:2:26|The eccentric [Yang Luchan] excitedly took the pellet gun and aimed it at the battlefield, striking a handsome pose. With a loud shout, he swiftly charged into the battlefield, heading towards the area with the most Qing soldiers. Seeing the menacing figure approaching, the Qing soldiers swept their swords towards his lower body, but [Yang Luchan] leaped up, dodging the attacks and swiftly knocked down two soldiers with his spear.
0:2:26|0:2:45|He then skillfully maneuvered his weapon, quickly defeating the surrounding soldiers. At that moment, the leader of the Tianli Sect was observing the battlefield with a monocular telescope and immediately spotted the Qing cavalry, brandishing their long spears as they charged towards the battlefield.
0:2:54|0:3:11|A Nan rode into the battlefield and knocked [Yang Luchan] to the ground. He lifted his headscarf and delivered a punch to the right temple of [Yang Luchan]. Instantly, veins bulged on his forehead, his eye sockets were only left with red and white, his messy long hair moved without wind, and most terrifyingly, his face became ferocious, showing signs of going berserk.
0:3:11|0:3:40|As for [Yang Luchan]'s transformation, it all started from his birth. The story took place 18 years ago in Guangping Prefecture, Hebei. On that night, the Yang family's mansion was brightly lit. Amidst the lightning and thunder, the young master of the Yang family was born. Unlike other babies, this young master flew directly from the delivery bed into the hands of the wet nurse. He sucked his fingers without crying or fussing, but there was a strange thing growing above his right temple. The weak smile of the newly delivered Yang's mother gave him the name [Yang Luchan]. After being observed by a physician...
0:3:40|0:3:54|Discovering a lump on his forehead, but [Yang's Mother] paid no attention to it, firmly believing that her son would achieve great things. She showered all her love on [Yang Luchan], who was naturally dull-witted and stubborn, coupled with the lump on his forehead, which led to him being constantly overlooked by [Yang's Father].
0:3:55|0:4:11|That day, [Yang's Mother] put a delicate melon hat on [Yang Luchan] and eagerly gestured to her husband to look at their presentable son. However, [Yang's Father], busy with his abacus, didn't even look up. Unwilling to give up, [Yang's Mother] requested again, but [Yang's Father] coldly shook off her hand and left. At that moment, young [Yang Luchan] had already eaten the fruits on the tree.
0:4:11|0:4:21|Facing the scolding from [Yang's Mom], little [Yang Luchan] just pitifully said he was hungry. [Yang's Mom], who grew up in the martial arts world, believed that human nature is inherently evil and one must rely on oneself. She had to make plans for herself and [Yang Luchan].
0:4:21|0:4:29|Yang's Mom caught her husband red-handed in the study with the account books. As the seasons changed, Yang Luchan grew day by day. One day, he bought a string of candied haws on the street.
0:4:29|0:4:41|The founder of the family troupe, [Old Zhao], happened to be performing on the street with his apprentice. [Yang Luchan] was holding a candied fruit stick and excitedly squeezed into the crowd to watch the performance. Suddenly, [Old Zhao] performed a carp jump and instantly received a round of applause.
0:4:41|0:4:48|[Yang Luchan] used both hands and feet to imitate the movements of [Old Zhao], completely unaware that he had already caught the attention of the chubby boy next to him.
0:4:48|0:5:8|The chubby boy took advantage of [Yang Luchan]'s inattention to snatch the candied hawthorn from his hand and ran away. When caught up by [Yang Luchan], the chubby boy remained very arrogant, even taking a bite of the candied hawthorn in front of [Yang Luchan]. Angered, [Yang Luchan] rushed forward to snatch it back, but his hat was knocked off by the chubby boy's companion. The chubby boy burst into laughter upon seeing the flesh horn on [Yang Luchan]'s forehead, and even reached out to poke it hard.
0:5:8|0:5:13|The child, who was still lively and jumping around, unexpectedly fell straight down after being hit.
0:5:13|0:5:32|The chubby boy and his gang were scared silly, even the adults watching the acrobatics gathered around. Seeing the audience dispersing, [Old Zhao] was also at a loss and couldn't help but join in the fun. [Yang Luchan] had his eyes tightly closed, his young face quickly covered with veins. Suddenly, he clenched his fist, performed a carp jump and stood up, shouting loudly, and rushed towards those people.
0:5:32|0:5:44|Surprisingly, this move is exactly the same as the one [Old Zhao] used before. With one punch, [Yang Luchan] sent the big kid in front flying three meters away, and then with another punch, the chubby kid also flew up and smashed the plaque behind him into two halves.
0:5:44|0:6:4|[Old Zhao] stepped forward to pull [Yang Luchan], who was about to start a one-sided fight with a group of kids. However, [Yang Luchan] retaliated with a punch that made [Old Zhao] take several steps back. While retreating, [Old Zhao] couldn't help but marvel at the strength of [Yang Luchan]. After the punch, [Yang Luchan] seemed to lose his balance, rolling his eyes and staggering backwards. Suddenly, two streams of nosebleed gushed out from his nose.
0:6:4|0:6:15|[Yang Luchan] fainted with his eyes closed. At the same time, [Yang's Mom] was caught red-handed in embezzlement. She was kneeling in the hall, and [Yang's Father] threw a stack of account books at her face, demanding to know how much money she had stolen.
0:6:17|0:6:29|[Yang's Mother] calmly said she was making plans for [Yang Luchan], [Yang's Father] angrily kicked towards her upon hearing this, but was bitten on the leg in retaliation. Enraged, [Yang's Father] ordered the servants to kill [Yang's Mother], who angrily shouted out who dared to. Surprisingly, none of the Yang family's servants dared to step forward.
0:6:29|0:6:53|[Yang's Mother] choked back tears as she accused [Yang's Father] of being despicable. She said there was no need for servants to do the dirty work, and then she went straight to a nearby pillar and slammed her head against it. In an instant, all she could see was a sea of red. At this moment, [Yang Luchan] had already regained consciousness. He grabbed a pancake and started walking home, with [Old Zhao] and his disciple following closely behind. The disciple couldn't understand why they were following [Yang Luchan], but [Old Zhao] simply explained that this child was very useful.
0:6:53|0:7:5|As the three of them arrived at the entrance of Yang's residence, they saw several servants dragging Yang's Mother, who had already fainted, and throwing her onto a side path. Yang Luchan stood still for a moment, threw away the pastry in his hand, and pounced on Yang's Mother, calling out for her.
0:7:5|0:7:17|In the blink of an eye, the wind and snow were relentless. [Yang's Mother] leaned weakly against a withered tree, regretting that she could no longer take care of [Yang Luchan]. [Old Zhao] hurried forward and introduced himself as Zhao Kanping. He pulled [Yang Luchan] over and pointed to the piece of meat, explaining,
0:7:17|0:7:26|This is actually the Three Flowers Gathering at the Top. Most people can't reach this level even after decades of practice. He praised [Yang Luchan] as a genius with unlimited potential.
0:7:26|0:7:37|Yang's mother, with a weak voice, agreed after a moment of thought and immediately asked Yang Luchan to kneel down to Old Zhao, saying with a bitter smile that as long as she trusted him, she would let him take care of Yang Luchan.
0:7:37|0:7:45|In this world, besides himself, only [Old Zhao] recognized [Yang Luchan] as a genius, and at the same time she urged [Yang Luchan] to do this one thing well in his life.
0:7:45|0:7:54|[Yang Luchan] looked at his mother with a silly smile after paying respects to his master. [Yang's Mom], with tears in her eyes, lied to him that she wanted to take a nap, and then peacefully passed away leaning against a tree.
0:7:54|0:8:11|Yang Luchan, penniless, buried his mother with the help of Old Zhao and his disciples. The young child then tearfully kowtowed three times in front of his mother's grave before following his new master and leaving. Old Zhao recognized the three flowers on Yang Luchan's head and insisted on supporting him, clearly with a certain intention.
0:8:11|0:8:24|This is the tragic childhood experience of the eccentric [Yang Luchan]. The original noble son of the Ya family ended up only accompanied by the yellow sand battlefield. In the blink of an eye, 10 years have passed, and [Yang Luchan] has become a divine soldier, the strongest weapon used by the Tianli Sect to deal with the Qing army.
0:8:24|0:8:33|And [Old Zhao] is the head of the Tianli Sect. Back then, he pretended to be a performer, but in reality, he was recruiting soldiers and challenging the ruling authorities.
0:8:41|0:8:52|The flashback ends, the scene returns to the battlefield, where [A Nan] dismounts and tackles [Yang Luchan], delivering a punch to the flesh corner of his right temple. As [Yang Luchan] gets up, he once again exhibits a violent demeanor.
0:8:52|0:9:6|He caught two long spears thrown by the Qing soldiers barehanded, then rushed forward and knocked the two soldiers away. Later, [Yang Luchan] smashed another soldier into the air, while catching the man's helmet and throwing it at the nearby soldiers. Any object around [Yang Luchan] could become a weapon in his hands.
0:9:6|0:9:20|He then lifted a shield, held it above his head to catch the blades chopped down by the soldiers, and instantly flipped them all over. At this moment, he was like a human killing machine that no one dared to approach. However, when he stopped, nosebleed sprayed out again.
0:9:22|0:9:33|The battle ended quickly, with [A Nan] riding his horse swiftly into the camp. [Yang Luchan] lay unconscious on the horse's back, while [A Nan] riding the horse looked extremely anxious.
0:9:35|0:9:45|[A Nan] stopped in front of a tent treating wounded soldiers and pulled [Yang Luchan] off his horse. Inside the tent, there were wounded soldiers missing arms and legs everywhere, and a physician was stitching up a soldier's wound with a needle.
0:9:45|0:10:0|[A Nan] rushed into the tent with the unconscious [Yang Luchan] on his back, carefully laying him on the bed in front of the physician. He leaned in close to the physician's ear and whispered softly. Meanwhile, [Dong Ye] nonchalantly puffed on his long pipe, blowing smoke rings with a casual expression.
0:10:6|0:10:20|[Dong Ye] opened his eyes and spat out some tobacco leaves. He tapped [Yang Luchan]'s head with his pipe to signal him to turn around. Then he leaned over [Yang Luchan]'s head for a while before sitting back in his chair and picking up some tobacco residue.
0:11:53|0:12:9|Old Zhao threw a punch straight at Dong Ye's abdomen as he spoke. Dong Ye tightened his abdomen to dodge the punch, then pushed Old Zhao back several steps with a thrust of his belly. Old Zhao, unwilling to show weakness, grabbed Dong Ye's neck. Dong Ye used his pipe as a weapon to strike Old Zhao's arm. When Old Zhao let go, Dong Ye grabbed his robe and pulled it up.
0:12:12|0:12:29|Old Zhao, who was furious, stood up and performed a sweeping leg kick towards Dong Ye. Dong Ye stepped on his foot and blocked Old Zhao's fist. Failing in his first attempt, Old Zhao then stood up and kicked towards Dong Ye, who kneeled down and used internal force to send Old Zhao flying with his foot.
0:12:34|0:12:48|After saying that, [Dong Ye] disdainfully glanced at [Old Zhao] lying on the straw mat, picked up his pipe and turned away, leaving only a back view for the stunned followers of the Tianli Sect. At night, the soldiers were already asleep, only [Yang Luchan] staring wide-eyed, unable to sleep all night.
0:13:4|0:13:12|While [Yang Luchan] was tossing and turning in his sleepless state, a single telescope was quietly observing the camp of the Tianli Sect.
0:13:21|0:13:36|[Yang Luchan] rushed out of the tent in a panic, only to see flames soaring outside. The Qing army and the Tianli Sect were fighting fiercely. The physician [Dong Ye] was shot through by arrows from the Qing army. [Yang Luchan] hurriedly supported [Dong Ye], but they both fell to the ground together.
0:13:55|0:14:3|[Dong Ye] left in this way. The Heavenly Way Sect was just a group of untrained individuals, quickly defeated by the well-trained Qing army and scattered in all directions.
0:14:18|0:14:29|[A Nan], engulfed in flames, was burned beyond recognition. He mustered his last strength to kick open the collapsed watchtower and buried himself underneath it. [Yang Luchan] looked on in confusion, then gritted his teeth and escaped.
0:14:29|0:14:44|The Tianli Sect's camp was engulfed in flames, burning for a long time until only bare frames were left. The victorious Qing army, after slaughtering all the sect members, raised their flag high and departed. And so, our film "Tai Chi 1: Zero to Hero" officially begins.
0:14:44|0:15:1|This film is the first 3D martial arts movie in which Eddie Peng starred. In addition to his first appearance in period costume drama, it is also the first time in his 10-year career that he played a villain. The protagonist of the film, portrayed by Yuan Xiaochao, is not a professional actor but a martial arts expert. He won the national stick fighting championship in 2007.
0:15:1|0:15:20|In 2010, he won the men's long fist championship at the Guangzhou Asian Games, and his role in Tai Chi 1 made him the most expensive newcomer in Huayi's history. The character he played, [Yang Luchan], is a real person who founded the Yang-style Tai Chi Chuan, the first martial artist in Chinese history to promote Tai Chi Chuan.
0:15:20|0:15:31|Yang's Tai Chi, modified by the Yang family for non-martial purposes, is easy to learn, making it the most popular Chinese martial art in the world today with the largest number of practitioners.
0:15:32|0:15:38|The story goes back to the moment when [Yang Luchan], who narrowly escaped death, followed the advice of [Dong Ye] and embarked on a journey to [Chen Village].
0:15:41|0:15:47|Several children stood on a hill, looking down at [Yang Luchan] at the foot of the mountain.
0:15:53|0:16:13|The child pointed behind him spontaneously, only to see a towering mountain shrouded in mist, reaching straight into the sky. [Yang Luchan] is a determined person, the seemingly endless mountain in front of him did not make him feel fearful at all. Without a moment of hesitation, he immediately set foot on the road to Chen Village. The mountain was extremely steep, almost a 70-degree slope.
0:16:13|0:16:21|[Yang Luchan] carefully stepped on the rocks as he climbed upwards, with broken rocks falling beneath his feet. After climbing for who knows how long, he finally could see the mountaintop.
0:16:21|0:16:33|[Yang Luchan] climbed up the last rock and stood on the top of the mountain. The long climb left him panting heavily. As he gasped for air, he looked down and suddenly a smile couldn't help but appear on his face.
0:16:33|0:16:48|In the next second, [Yang Luchan] has already started running forward, with many weeds on the mountaintop, but they cannot stop his pace. He uses both hands and feet to cross over the rocks to the other end of the mountain top. In front of him, the mountains still stretch endlessly, but at the foot of the mountain is a village, not very large in scale, standing alone.
0:16:48|0:17:0|It seems like forgotten, the test that [Yang Luchan] is about to face unfolds as he approaches Chen Family Valley. [Yang Luchan] strides with cheerful steps, running through a patch of weeds, unaware of
0:17:0|0:17:12|Just passing by a big tree, a person with a bamboo hat hanging upside down with a hook, suspending himself on the tree, quietly observing. Soon, [Yang Luchan] arrived in front of a stone wall with three strong and powerful characters carved on it: Chen Family Valley.
0:17:23|0:17:28|[Yang Luchan] looked confused for a moment and then ran towards a mahjong table.
0:17:33|0:18:2|Suddenly, a steam car appeared at the village entrance, driving recklessly towards them. The driver seemed unfamiliar with the controls, swerving and shaking all the way. The villagers panicked and dodged as they saw the steering wheel being turned sharply, causing the car to veer sideways and crash. [Yang Luchan] was hit head-on as he turned around, unable to avoid it, and was sent flying. The car then continued to crash into a steamed bun stall and a watermelon stand before finally swaying to a stop.
0:18:2|0:18:23|A woman hurriedly ran off the car and headed straight for [Yang Luchan]. She squatted down anxiously and asked, the woman was the only daughter of the head of the Chen family, [Chen Yuniang]. [Yang Luchan] sat up dazedly, his eyes lit up when he saw the scattered steamed buns around him. Ignoring [Chen Yuniang], he picked up a steamed bun and gobbled it up hungrily.
0:18:26|0:18:32|Fang Zijing, wearing a top hat, gets off the car and elegantly buttons up his suit.
0:19:0|0:19:6|[Yang Luchan] kept his mouth half open, stuffed with a steamed bun, for quite a while. The steam car started again.
0:19:6|0:19:20|[Fang Zijing] drove towards the village with a touch of aloofness and pride, while [Chen Yuniang] sat in the passenger seat, laughing happily. It was only then that [Yang Luchan] reacted, turned around and ran towards the car, but his legs were no match for the speed of the wheels, and the car drove further and further away.
0:19:20|0:19:30|[Yang Luchan] stopped in his tracks and gazed ahead foolishly. The car entered the first gate, and facing him was a stone arch bridge. Only by passing through here could one truly enter Chen Family Village.
0:19:32|0:19:42|The village, though small, embodies the saying "though the sparrow be but little, it possesses all its internal organs." Right next to the stone bridge are the archway and teahouse, with the market and post office situated in the center of the village. The villagers rarely see this peculiarly shaped iron box.
0:19:42|0:19:54|The steam car was stopped by curious villagers everywhere it went, and further ahead was Qingfeng Ridge. At the foot of Qingfeng Ridge sat the [Chen Family Ancestral Hall], which also served as the gathering place for the entire [Chen Family Valley].
0:19:54|0:20:10|[Ancestral Hall] Next door is an ear room, which also serves as a utility room. At this moment, the ear room is bustling with activity. [Chen Youzhi] is vigorously pedaling, driving a large wheel to spin rapidly. The wires at the bottom of the wheel are connected to the light bulb on the nearby table.
0:20:10|0:20:16|Chen Gengyun stared at the light bulb seriously for a long time. When it didn't respond, he couldn't help but complain,
0:20:48|0:21:5|Chen Gengyun quietly twisted the knob next to him, and the wheel immediately spun rapidly. However, the clueless Chen Youzhi did not notice his elder brother's small action and instead pedaled even harder. Unexpectedly, the machine was very fragile. It suddenly snapped a wire and stopped spinning under high speed.
0:21:7|0:21:13|At night, the [Chen Family Ancestral Hall] became lively, with the old men walking inside in groups of three or four.
0:21:20|0:21:25|In the ancestral hall, inside the room, [Fang Zijing] cautiously lifted a small corner of the door curtain and anxiously looked out.
0:21:36|0:21:42|[Fang Zijing] ignored [Chen Yuniang] and turned around to pick up the letter on the table, walking to the sand table to read it.
0:21:55|0:22:13|Third Uncle nodded in agreement, greeted his people, and sat in the main seat with the support of [Chen Yuniang]. Then he pointed to the chair next to him and asked. After speaking, [Chen Yuniang] looked towards the villagers gathered in the hall.
0:22:29|0:22:47|The villagers looked at each other, even Old Zhao furrowed his brows. Chen Yuniang saw this and could only cast her gaze on her second brother. Chen Gengyun helplessly rolled his eyes at his sister, clapped his hands perfunctorily, and then Fang Zijing pushed out the sand table he had prepared earlier. Old Zhao couldn't help but sit up straight and take a look after seeing the sand table.
0:23:27|0:23:34|Chen Er Sao had just raised her hand when she was glared back by [Chen Gengyun].
0:23:47|0:24:7|[Fang Zijing] walked towards the machine that had been prepared in advance. After [Chen Yuniang] extinguished all the candlesticks in the hall, [Fang Zijing] pulled down the switch. The large wheel, which had only turned when [Chen Youzhi] pedaled the foot pedal, suddenly began to spin rapidly. The light bulbs hanging from the beams in the ancestral hall lit up one by one.
0:24:9|0:24:36|As soon as [Fang Zijing] finished speaking, the light bulb lit up abnormally. The broken connection sparked, the pointer on the instrument panel jumped to the maximum, and then the light bulbs burst one after another in the sound of electricity. Wires with sparks hung down from the ceiling, sweeping off the candles on the altar, instantly igniting a flame. [Chen's two sons] rushed to the altar to put out the fire.
0:24:36|0:24:44|In the end, it was the tea brought by [Chen Yuniang] that saved the day. The other villagers had already fled the ancestral hall, and no one was interested in [Fang Zijing]'s foreign technology anymore.
0:24:44|0:24:53|In the worried expression of [Chen Yuniang], he pursed his lips, slowly lowered his head in dismay, and took off the courtesy on his head, while the third uncle walked behind [Fang Zijing] with a cold face.
0:25:1|0:25:21|In the ancestral hall, everyone left, leaving only [Fang Zijing] and the reluctant [Chen Yuniang]. [Fang Zijing] watched the receding crowd with a cold look in his eyes, the original frustration had long disappeared in the contemptuous hatred. He then put on his hat again and walked out without saying a word.
0:25:21|0:25:40|That day's chaotic situation had long been forgotten by the simple villagers, and a new day began. The village was filled with the smell of fireworks, mothers were eating fresh fried dough sticks with their children by the roadside, and a young cowherd was leading a donkey through the market. The main hall in the center of the market, the ancestral pharmacy of the [Chen family], was also open for business, now managed by [Chen Yuniang].
0:25:40|0:25:51|In the corner of the pharmacy, there is a rack resembling a tree trunk, with trays filled with medicinal herbs on the deep branches. [Chen Yuniang] glanced at the prescription, then firmly planted her feet and, with the strength of four ounces moving a thousand pounds, began to manipulate the wooden rack.
0:25:51|0:26:0|Accurately grabbing the herbs needed from the rotating tray and throwing them into the mortar, [Yang Luchan] suddenly burst into the pharmacy. Startled, [Chen Yuniang] turned around.
0:26:3|0:26:9|Chen Yuniang saw Yang Luchan looking clueless, took out a stack of copper coins from her waist pouch and placed them on the table.
0:26:40|0:27:0|Chen Yuniang pulled a piece of hemp rope from the top of the wheel above her head to prepare bandages for medicine. With a hint of inexplicable smile upon hearing this, she turned back and gestured for Yang Luchan to follow, pointing to the road directly opposite the medicine shop.
0:27:40|0:27:46|[Chen Yuniang] poured a cup of coffee and elegantly took a sip.
0:27:58|0:28:9|Yang Luchan reached out his hand trying to grab Chen Yuniang, but Chen Yuniang agilely turned and stepped back, causing Yang Luchan to miss. After steadying her stance, she immediately performed the classic Chen-style Tai Chi move, "Reverse Rollback."
0:28:9|0:28:18|[Yang Luchan] immediately assumed a defensive stance upon seeing the situation, striking out with a single hand in a palm strike. As [Chen Yuniang] retreated, she deflected [Yang Luchan]'s attacks, not allowing him to touch even a corner of her clothes.
0:28:18|0:28:28|Following that, [Chen Yuniang] took advantage of [Yang Luchan]'s swaying and elbowed him back to the edge of the terrace. Feeling unwilling to accept defeat, [Yang Luchan] charged forward again and grabbed [Chen Yuniang]'s arms, only to be countered by [Chen Yuniang] locking his vital acupoints.
0:28:44|0:28:52|Chen Yuniang didn't expect Yang Luchan to fall straight down without any resistance. However, when she looked down, Yang Luchan had disappeared without a trace.
0:28:52|0:29:7|In the village of Chenjiagou, there is a river with an inconspicuous bridge tunnel by the river, with a simple wooden door. When [Yang Luchan] opened his eyes, he found himself hanging upside down on the beam, with a bowl of nosebleed below, and a man with small glasses sitting in front of him.
0:29:23|0:29:29|Yang Luchan had no idea that the person wearing the small glasses at the entrance of Chen's village was the one carrying the bamboo hat.
0:29:51|0:30:15|Upon hearing these words, [Old Zhao] furrowed his brow and stared at [Yang Luchan] in front of him. He then tapped the hammer in his hand and approached, causing [Yang Luchan] to shiver in fear. [Old Zhao] pursed his lips disapprovingly, rolled his eyes, patted [Yang Luchan] on the shoulder, gave him a look of no chance, and walked towards the cave.
0:30:19|0:30:39|[Old Zhao] didn't look up, just kept fiddling with the things in his hands. The expression on [Yang Luchan]'s face instantly dimmed, he hung his head and rubbed his headscarf for a long time without saying a word. After a moment of hesitation, [Old Zhao] finally stood up again, turned [Yang Luchan]'s shoulder, and wiped the still wet blood from his nose.
0:31:4|0:31:8|Old Zhao paid no attention to Yang Luchan's shouts. After exiting the bridge tunnel, he unexpectedly walked up the steep slope in a vertical manner. At night.
0:31:8|0:31:28|[Fang Zijing], dressed in Western formal wear, walked out of the ancestral hall with a melancholic expression. Behind him, [Chen Yuniang] wheeled out a phonograph. Ignoring her actions, [Fang Zijing] looked around blankly before sitting on the steps at the door. [Chen Yuniang], in a plain Western-style dress, smilingly placed the needle on the record and lifted her skirt to sit beside [Fang Zijing].
0:32:47|0:32:53|Fang Zijing, who had nowhere to vent his anger, suddenly picked up the phonograph and smashed it to pieces. Then he walked down the steps and mocked himself.
0:33:2|0:33:22|After mocking Chen Yuniang, Fang Zijing disdainfully smirked, turned around without looking back, and walked out of the ancestral hall courtyard. Chen Yuniang stared blankly at the suddenly unfamiliar man in front of her, tears starting to well up in her eyes. Inside the ancestral hall, someone quietly watched from behind the hanging big clock, silently observing this scene. If Yang Luchan were here at this moment, he would surely be greatly shocked.
0:33:22|0:33:31|Because the man with the hanging golden hook officially saved [Old Zhao].
0:33:49|0:33:56|A discordant voice interrupted the hesitant [Chen Yuniang] as [Yang Luchan] fearlessly stood before him once again.
0:34:2|0:34:17|The moment the postman heard this, he immediately stuck his head out of the window, while the woman beside him hurriedly covered the child's eyes. The next second, [Yang Luchan] flew out of the post office without any warning.
0:34:25|0:34:34|Chen Yuniang blocked Yang Luchan's fist with her right arm, then calmly pressed down on his arms with one hand and struck his neck with the other hand.
0:34:34|0:34:46|[Yang Luchan] had no choice but to dodge and was then sent flying by a palm strike from [Chen Yuniang]. [Old Zhao], hidden in the crowd, frowned at the scene before him. [Yang Luchan] immediately stood up straight and stubbornly rushed towards [Chen Yuniang] again.
0:35:3|0:35:26|Taking a defensive stance cautiously, [Chen Yuniang] remained composed, suddenly catching [Yang Luchan]'s fist. She then used a move of double pushing hands to make [Yang Luchan] stumble. As [Yang Luchan] pressed towards [Chen Yuniang]'s vital point with his palms, [Chen Yuniang] smoothly grasped his hand, pulled back and twisted it, pushing him away. While [Yang Luchan] was still staggering backwards, [Chen Yuniang] leaped up and executed a move called "Cross Connecting Kicks," aiming at [Yang Luchan]'s chest.
0:36:30|0:36:42|Under the escort of well-trained foreign soldiers, a young Western-looking woman walked into the yamen. With a cold smile on her face, she walked straight to [Magistrate Dao].
0:36:44|0:36:51|[Master Dao] showed no fear, standing up with a critical gaze.
0:37:19|0:37:31|Hearing what [Fang Zijing] pointed out, [Dong Ye] took small steps and climbed up the wooden stairs to a lookout tower, wanting to witness with his own eyes the power of the industrial revolution.
0:37:31|0:37:41|[Fang Zijing] stood behind [Dong Ye] with confidence, his face showing the satisfaction of impending revenge. Meanwhile, [Clara] from the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution couldn't hide her inner pride and arrogance.
0:37:41|0:37:57|A colossal object quickly appeared in front of [Dao Tai Lord], towering two stories high with walls of bronze and iron, equipped with a steam engine. It looked just like a moving castle. The scene then shifted to outside the entrance of Chen Family Valley, where a heavy rain was pouring down. Villagers were hurriedly packing up their stalls, wearing raincoats.
0:37:57|0:38:20|Yang Luchan squatted under a cart with his knees hugged, feeling aggrieved. Old Zhao leaned against the door of a thatched cottage, puffing on a pipe while contemplating. Chen Yuniang held an umbrella and came to observe the villagers' activities. Upon seeing Yang Luchan, she slowly stopped in her tracks. Yang Luchan, shivering from the cold, hugged himself tightly and sought comfort in the bellyband embroidered by his mother, unaware of Chen Yuniang's presence.
0:38:27|0:38:47|[Yang Luchan] looked at the embroidered picture and secretly made up his mind. He quickly formulated a village entry strategy in his mind, and the first step to enter the village was to break through the village entrance. At this time, the stalls outside the village entrance were bustling, and not far away, a pile of small grass stacks was neatly arranged. Suddenly, one of the grass stacks started to move mysteriously, slowly moving towards the village entrance. [Yang Luchan] thought that no one had noticed.
0:38:47|0:39:14|Moving towards the village with a haystack on his head, the middle-aged man sitting on the eaves at the village entrance, [Qinbo], was staring intently at the moving haystack. Just as [Yang Luchan] thought he had deceived everyone, [Qinbo] suddenly kicked the haystack, scattering it and sending [Yang Luchan] flying out. He crashed directly into a pile of grass at the village entrance. Refusing to back down, he raised his fist towards [Qinbo], but [Qinbo] grabbed his arm and pulled him back, simultaneously slamming into his stomach. As [Yang Luchan] was thrown out, the outcome was already clear.
0:39:14|0:39:45|The next day, [Yang Luchan] avoided the village entrance and circled around to approach the market from the side. Unexpectedly, a young girl had been waiting there for a long time. Seeing the girl with twin ponytails standing in front of him, reaching only to his chest, [Yang Luchan] felt a bit tongue-tied. The girl took the initiative, grabbing [Yang Luchan]'s collar with both hands. However, [Yang Luchan] didn't want to be entangled, so he grabbed her arms and pulled her behind him. Strangely, no matter how hard [Yang Luchan] struggled to break free, the girl could always grab onto his clothes. As [Yang Luchan] turned to leave, the girl caught hold of his clothes again. [Yang Luchan] kicked straight towards the girl's forehead. Seeing the girl panic for a moment,
0:39:45|0:39:56|Taking advantage of [Yang Luchan]'s moment of hesitation, the girl kicked him directly in the chest with a soft heart. [Yang Luchan] staggered back several steps, holding his chest for a while without recovering. Meanwhile, [Old Zhao] stood by with a pipe in his mouth, looking on with a face of amusement.
0:39:56|0:40:19|Seeing the girl lift a half-head-sized stone with one foot, her toe sharply aiming at [Yang Luchan]'s knee pit. [Yang Luchan] was hit and immediately bent one knee, lowering himself by half. Seizing the opportunity, the girl leaped up and stood directly on his shoulder. She used her ankle to clamp [Yang Luchan]'s head, forcing him to rotate continuously. Just as [Yang Luchan] was getting dizzy, she leaped up again, reversed 360 degrees, and kicked straight at [Yang Luchan]'s forehead, sending him flying once more.
0:40:20|0:40:31|After the girl landed lightly on the ground, she smiled and put away her moves. In fact, in the past 120 years, a total of 87 boxers have come to Chen Family Valley, of which 63 people heard that Chen Family Boxing is not passed on.
0:40:31|0:40:50|Automatically leaving, but 11 people were defeated at the village entrance, 5 people were knocked out at the market. However, [Yang Luchan] was like an indestructible cockroach, quickly planning his third round. The location of the third round was chosen at the archway, with the gatekeeper being Mahjong Sister. Mahjong Sister set up the table seriously, suddenly she threw the tiles down, flipped the table, and all the mahjong tiles flew towards [Yang Luchan].
0:40:51|0:41:2|[Yang Luchan] was powerless against this blow and screamed as he flew out again. Except for those people from before, everyone else stopped at the archway. Now, besides Dong Ye, who sneaked into the village to do odd jobs,
0:41:2|0:41:13|Only [Yang Luchan] was left. At this moment, [Yang Luchan] lay on the warm grass, then sat up in the sunlight, excitedly demonstrating the martial arts he had learned during these days. Unbeknownst to him, [Old Zhao] appeared behind him.
0:42:4|0:42:7|[Old Zhao] woke up the dreamer with a single sentence, making [Yang Luchan] suddenly enlightened.
0:42:7|0:42:30|Villagers crowded around when they heard that [Yang Luchan] was challenging Tofu Brother. The challenge took place in the city center, where Tofu Brother, the 12th generation descendant of the Chen family boxing, demonstrated his skill by cutting a piece of tofu with a knife and catching it effortlessly with a piece of gauze. He then gestured towards [Yang Luchan] with the tofu in his hand.
0:42:32|0:42:47|[Yang Luchan] smiled kindly, then clenched his fist with one hand and aimed straight at the tofu. The tofu brother dodged the attack by sidestepping, holding the tofu with one hand and blocking [Yang Luchan]'s arm with the other. Then, he took a few steps back, and using his scapula to directly hit [Yang Luchan]'s chest, sending him flying seven to eight meters away.
0:42:48|0:43:9|On the second-floor terrace, [Chen Yuniang] couldn't help but step forward to watch. [Yang Luchan] lifted his leg to kick at Tofu Brother, but was split open by Tofu Brother's palm. Then, Tofu Brother dismantled [Yang Luchan]'s moves in three or two moves, pushing him back several steps with a palm strike. When [Yang Luchan] came forward with a straight punch again, Tofu Brother caught his wrists with both hands, propping up the tofu with his right hand and using his left hand to turn [Yang Luchan]'s head, followed by a kick to his buttocks.
0:43:9|0:43:16|Old Zhao, unable to bear watching any longer, quietly called out to [Yang Luchan], then tapped the donkey with a smoking pipe. Upon hearing the sound, [Yang Luchan] immediately raised his head.
0:43:23|0:43:45|The words of Old Zhao came to mind, making [Yang Luchan] instantly confident. He raised the corners of his mouth and made a gesture of offering fruit like a monkey. The old lady sitting nearby couldn't sit still anymore. As soon as the old lady's voice fell, [Yang Luchan] took a quick step back, then suddenly turned around with a palm-pushing motion directly pressuring Tofu Brother. Tofu Brother was caught off guard by the sudden attack of the Chen family's boxing technique.
0:43:45|0:44:11|[After immobilizing Yang Luchan's hands and feet, he lost his follow-up moves. Tofu was seen spinning rapidly in the palms of the two, making it difficult to determine the winner for a moment. Yang Luchan used the moves previously used by Tofu Brother to resolve the crisis in front of him one by one, even using his scapula to push against Tofu Brother's cheek. According to Mahjong Sister, Yang Luchan's lazy dress move actually allowed Tofu to escape from Tofu Brother's hands. Determined, Tofu Brother reached out to grab the tofu and at the same time, used his knee to lock around Yang Luchan's neck.]
0:44:11|0:44:33|Pushing him down and kicking him in the stomach, [Yang Luchan] flipped in the air and fell to the ground. Just as he was getting up to counterattack, someone suddenly kicked him in the spine. Without time to react, [Yang Luchan] lunged straight at Tofu Brother, who was knocked back and fell to the ground, the tofu slipping from his hands. [Yang Luchan] looked puzzled for a moment, then picked up the tofu from the ground and placed it back in Tofu Brother's hands.
0:44:33|0:44:39|He then stood up and grinned, saying,
0:44:42|0:45:4|The tofu seller straightened up and couldn't help but laugh when he looked at the tofu in his hand. The chatter around gradually brought [Yang Luchan] back to reality, and he excitedly pushed through the crowd and ran off.
0:45:22|0:45:29|[Yang Luchan] ran to the big tree in the middle of the village, looked up at the watchtower built on top, and climbed up without hesitation.
0:45:38|0:45:51|He agilely climbed to the top of the wooden frame and anxiously looked down at the street below. While [Chen Yuniang] looked up at him thoughtfully.
0:45:52|0:46:15|Below, [Old Zhao] seemed to be patting the wooden frame next to him in frustration, then he lowered his hat and slipped away. Meanwhile, [Yang Luchan] with a nosebleed, his eyes also becoming unfocused, swayed and leaned against the wooden frame. He weakly closed his eyes, and the gushing nosebleed made it impossible for [Yang Luchan] to stay conscious. He then fainted on the small watchtower.
0:46:28|0:46:47|[Old Zhao] knew he couldn't deceive [Chen Yuniang], so he arrogantly flipped his braid and walked away. At this moment, a great commotion occurred in the village. With the ground shaking, the tofu on the tofu stall began to tremble, birds fluttered anxiously in their cages, even the porcelain on the shelves was shaken down and smashed. The villagers were screaming in panic.
0:46:47|0:47:12|Before [Chen Yuniang] could react, the monster mentioned by the villagers had already arrived at the village gorge. This was the Trojan brought by Claire, a fortress almost two stories high. The Trojan moved very slowly, but the metallic sheen all over it exuded a great deterrent force. Its kinetic energy all came from coal, so it was constantly shrouded in black smoke. Passing through layers of copper walls and iron walls, one could see that the interior space was not small, with over a dozen operators working inside.
0:47:14|0:47:21|The foreign military officer shouted at the workers to increase their horsepower, while two workers were diligently pushing two iron rails onto the conveyor belt.
0:47:21|0:47:33|Old Zhao: I didn't expect this guy to be able to lay down tracks while moving. Soon, the foreign military officer received word that they had arrived at Chen Family Valley. The confused villagers approached, their faces showing their alertness and puzzlement.
0:47:33|0:47:56|Cautiously looking around, while Claire sat in the driver's seat with a cold face showing disdain and contempt. At this moment, [Chen Yuniang] finally squeezed to the front of the crowd, looking at Troy with confusion. Although it had temporarily stopped, the internal cooperation never ceased. Under the constant urging of the officer, the workers desperately shoveled coal into the boiler. As two soldiers tacitly turned the valve, the internal machinery started running again.
0:48:0|0:48:20|With ample energy provided by the burning coal, the gauge pointer moved to a very impressive position. Claire sneered and shifted the gear directly to the lowest, causing thick smoke to instantly spew out from the external steam hole. Ignoring the villagers surrounding Troy, she tightly gripped the steering wheel and continued to move forward. The villagers were greatly frightened by the sudden start of this monster.
0:48:22|0:48:36|Desperately running towards the village, [Chen Yuniang] decisively stayed behind to cover the retreat of the villagers. She maintained the evacuation route while keeping a close eye on the approaching Trojan. Fortunately, the Trojan was not very fast, and the villagers quickly escaped into the village. It stopped again a few yards away from the village gate.
0:48:36|0:48:54|Under the cover of white smoke, the lid on top of Troy suddenly opened to reveal a platform, and [Fang Zijing] stood on it, slowly appearing before everyone's eyes. He did not see [Chen Yuniang] at the foot of Troy, but instead looked down on the villagers hiding in the village, with a hint of restrained satisfaction as he opened the notice in his hand.
0:49:17|0:49:32|Facing the taunts of [Chen Youzhi], [Fang Zijing] sneered disdainfully. Suddenly, Clara moved the rightmost panel down, and as a row of lights above her head lit up, she confidently nodded to the soldier beside her. The soldier took the order and began to turn the huge gears behind the cockpit with force.
0:49:32|0:49:59|With a loud noise, the semicircular gates on both sides of Troy were opened, and the huge mechanical arm, filled with iron chains and gears, extended out. As the mechanical arm fully stretched out, what came into everyone's sight was a huge steel monster, with a shovel in its left hand and an iron claw in its right hand, facing the villagers of Chenjiagou with a fierce look. [Chen Yuniang] stood calmly at the village gate, staring at Troy in front of her. Under the control of [Clare], Troy slowly rotated its body, extending the shovel under the simple wooden village gate, and then...
0:49:59|0:50:9|With a sudden force, the wooden door shattered instantly. She didn't hide her arrogance at all, coldly chuckled as she flicked another switch, and the iron claw on her right hand slowly rose, hanging directly above the house.
0:50:9|0:50:18|With Clara's manipulation again, the iron claws opened, puncturing the roof and grabbing a piece of debris. Faced with this massive machine, the villagers were powerless.
0:50:18|0:50:33|Can only scream and flee around. [Fang Zijing] looked disdainfully at everything in front of him, feeling extremely pleased. It wasn't until [Clara] was not satisfied with just destroying the buildings and reached out his iron claws towards [Yuniang] that he panicked.
0:50:35|0:50:55|[Fang Zijing]'s attempt to stop [Clara] did not make her stop, while [Yuniang] glared at her, standing at the village entrance without giving way. [Clara] provocatively loosened her iron claws and threw all the rubble in front of [Yuniang], raising a cloud of dust. [Yuniang] raised her hand to shield her eyes, and after the dust settled, she looked at [Fang Zijing] without hesitation and rebuked angrily.
0:50:56|0:51:12|[Fang Zijing] seemed to be moved, he lowered his eyes and hesitated with [Chen Yuniang] for a while, but in the end he turned around and pressed a button next to him. Then the platform he was standing on slowly descended, and the hooks on both sides of Troy were retracted.
0:51:12|0:51:35|Chen Yuniang watched as Fang Zijing walked away, feeling a mix of emotions. The villagers stood behind Chen Yuniang, looking fearfully at the monster in front of them. Even Troy's slight movements caused a shiver among the villagers. The village entrance had been leveled, with only the ruins and a lingering notice remaining in everyone's minds. In the next moment, Chen Yuniang rushed to the Chen family ancestral hall without stopping. She pushed open the door to find it already filled with distinguished guests.
0:51:35|0:51:42|However, these esteemed elders all lowered their heads in silence, with Third Uncle sitting upright and breathing deeply.
0:52:11|0:52:23|[Chen Yuniang] walked out without looking back after expressing her thoughts sternly. The group of old men remained silent like a pile of sculptures, each looking indifferent as if it had nothing to do with them, and the so-called leader who couldn't bear the responsibility in their mouths.
0:52:23|0:52:42|Old Zhao was still nowhere to be seen, only hanging himself upside down on the beams of the ancestral hall, quietly watching the scene. The construction of the railway began in full swing, with Troy stationed at the village entrance, making the villagers too scared to slack off. The foreign soldiers stationed here were even more bored, finding joy in intimidating the villagers on a daily basis.
0:52:44|0:53:3|At this moment, the workers were disloyally moving explosives into Troy and hoisting them to the second floor on roller skates. [Clara] vigilantly watched the workers until everything was done correctly, then turned and walked towards [Fang Zijing], who was directing the soldiers driving Troy, asking them to increase the horsepower to 340. Upon hearing this, [Clara] smiled and said that she had already given instructions for this matter.
0:53:11|0:53:19|[Clara] paused for a moment, turned around and smiled at [Fang Zijing].
0:54:10|0:54:37|[Clara] picked up a thick operation manual from the office chair and handed it to [Fang Zijing], then left without looking back. Meanwhile, by the river under the bridge, [Old Zhao] skillfully played with a phonograph, adjusting the needle onto the record. He teased while enjoying the music with his eyes closed, taking a deep puff from his pipe. On the bed beside him, [Yang Luchan] slowly woke up upon hearing the music.
0:55:41|0:55:46|[Old Zhao] hurriedly got up to stop [Yang Luchan] who was about to rush out, gesturing for him to sit back down.
0:55:55|0:56:1|[Chen Yuniang] smiled with a plan in mind. She first placed a piece of white paper in front of [Yang Luchan],
0:56:2|0:56:18|Taking up a teapot and placing it on the paper again, as a metaphor for the Trojan guarding the village entrance, he lined up several chess pieces in front of the teapot to represent the foreign soldiers. The workers' bathing area was very rudimentary, just a large pot set up on the open ground with some hot water heated up.
0:56:57|0:57:15|Yang Luchan, living up to everyone's expectations, successfully sneaked into the heart of Troy. At this moment, he is squatting in a corner, sketching the structures he observed on paper. Fang Zijing, dressed in plain clothes, is carrying a thick manual as he walks towards the tent. Meanwhile, Claire is holding a photo frame containing a picture of her and Fang Zijing, gazing quietly with a hint of unusual affection in her eyes.
0:57:22|0:57:39|[Clara] immediately tucked the photo frame into her clothes, then hastily closed the suitcase and stood up. Upon seeing the suitcase at her feet, [Fang Zijing] had a pleading look on his face, hoping she wouldn't leave. Little did they know that [Chen Yuniang] was observing their every move from the top of the tent, and [Clara] had no intention of staying.
0:57:45|0:57:52|Facing Fang Zijing's plea once again, Claire smiled sadly, realizing that her value here was just two cold iron rails.
0:57:57|0:58:10|At this moment, [Chen Yuniang]'s expression froze on her face, [Clare] also looked incredulous, several thoughts flashed through her mind, this sudden confession may be just a momentary impulse of [Fang Zijing], or it could be a long-standing secret admiration.
0:58:28|0:58:34|He turned his head eagerly to look at [Clara], because everything changed after meeting [Clara], and he also experienced a feeling he had never felt before.
0:58:36|0:58:59|[Clara] stared blankly at the man who made her unable to control her emotions, especially when [Fang Zijing] said "You changed me." [Clara] couldn't help but grab his hand, they looked deeply into each other's eyes, their gaze gradually shifting from their faces to their lips. [Chen Yuniang] lay on the top of the tent with tears in her eyes, watching helplessly as the two below got closer and closer, finally embracing and kissing passionately, even as tears streamed down [Chen Yuniang]'s cheeks.
0:58:59|0:59:6|She also kept her composure because there were more important things waiting for her to do, then she leaped into the tent.
0:59:6|0:59:16|Upon hearing a strange noise, [Fang Zijing] alertly turned around and was stunned to see [Chen Yuniang]. With tears in her eyes, [Chen Yuniang] silently moved to the table and took the manual.
0:59:28|0:59:51|Old Zhao didn't manage to catch up in the end. The next day arrived quickly, with heavy rain pouring down and the sky dark and gloomy. Only a few people on the road hurriedly ran towards their houses, including the post office director. He was seen holding an oil-paper umbrella in one hand and a food box in the other, taking small quick steps into the post office before he could relax. As he wiped the water droplets and walked towards the house, a hand suddenly appeared from somewhere and locked the outer door from the outside.
0:59:51|0:59:55|Chen Yuniang strides forward and throws the manual in front of him.
1:0:8|1:0:18|Faced with the naked warning from [Chen Yuniang], the post and telecommunications director wiped a cold sweat helplessly, tremblingly opened the manual of Troy, and the first sentence that caught his eye was a warning for operation.
1:0:18|1:0:29|At the same time, under the bridge, [Old Zhao] with glasses carefully examined the internal structure diagram of Troy made by [Yang Luchan]. However, no matter how many times he turned the drawing around, he couldn't figure out which way was the correct direction.
1:0:35|1:0:44|[Yang Luchan] assists [Old Changgong] in flipping the picture over, then takes out a stack of papers from his pocket and spreads them out.
1:0:52|1:0:57|After [Old Zhao] arranged the pattern in the correct order, the three-dimensional structure of Troy quickly formed in his mind.
1:1:2|1:1:7|He pinned one of the pictures on the stove, pointing to an empty space ahead, and said to [Yang Luchan],
1:1:35|1:1:42|At this moment, [Yang Luchan] seemed to be in the heart of Troy. He hurried through the passage, but was still scalded by the steam spraying out on one side, causing him to dance in pain.
1:1:55|1:2:4|[Old Zhao] used the blueprints posted everywhere and an empty space to construct a simulated Troy in front of [Yang Luchan], leading him around the so-called soldiers.
1:2:38|1:2:49|[Yang Luchan] held a iron rod and looked at the gears on the wall in confusion, feeling somewhat helpless. However, when he noticed the two gears under his feet were turning, he smiled and directly inserted the iron rod into the gap between the two gears.
1:3:0|1:3:28|The development of the situation ultimately matched [Yang Luchan]'s speculation. The gears rolled away the iron rod and continued to turn. The soldiers, who had disappeared, suddenly appeared, with their spears pointing directly at [Yang Luchan]. [Yang Luchan] dodged the sticks of two soldiers, leaped up by leveraging on them, landed behind a soldier, and then pushed away the soldiers who had just rushed down the stairs. He demonstrated a move of flying over the eaves, stepping on the surrounding gears to climb up. However, soldiers kept pouring in from upstairs and downstairs.
1:3:30|1:3:45|Upon seeing [Yang Luchan], he rushed towards him. [Yang Luchan] kicked away the box at his feet in an attempt to stop the soldiers, but when the box was knocked open by the soldiers, a large amount of explosives spilled out. [Yang Luchan] grabbed a kerosene lamp and hurled it towards the nearby soldiers, but one soldier split it in half with a stick, causing the lamp to fall to the ground and instantly ignite into flames.
1:3:45|1:4:4|After dealing with the last soldier, [Yang Luchan] cautiously observed his surroundings. Unexpectedly, an arm reached out from behind and grabbed [Yang Luchan]'s neck, dragging him backwards. The bare-chested Caucasian giant was a head taller than [Yang Luchan], with a robust physique. [Yang Luchan] managed to break free by twisting his pinky finger, then landed several punches on the giant's chest, but the giant remained unfazed.
1:4:4|1:4:29|Soon after, the big man grabbed [Yang Luchan]'s fist, turned him upside down 180 degrees, and kicked him out. Before [Yang Luchan] could even cry out in pain, he struggled to pick up a wrench next to him and smashed it towards the big man's leg. Unexpectedly, the big man grabbed the wrench, lifted [Yang Luchan] by the collar, and slammed him around. With his eyes blurred, [Yang Luchan] weakly awaited the big man's final blow. Suddenly, an arrow accurately hit the steam pipe, releasing a large amount of hot air towards both sides of the big man.
1:4:29|1:4:45|He covered his eyes in pain and kept retreating. [Yang Luchan] took the opportunity to use the carp stance to kick the big man out several steps. The big man with unsteady steps staggered a few steps and fell headfirst into the bottom-level boiler, instantly dead. [Yang Luchan] had no time to spare for anything else, joyfully greeted [Chen Yuniang] who had saved him in his time of peril.
1:4:56|1:5:7|The detailed drawing of the hidden lock on the blueprint, at the same time, the little girl Zhao Di also came to Troy. [Yang Luchan] and [Chen Yuniang] acted separately to search for the hidden lock.
1:5:9|1:5:34|[Yang Luchan] absentmindedly rubbed his head, and inadvertently lowered it to discover something extraordinary. The fearless Zhaodi, like a newborn calf not fearing the tiger, picked up a large stone and threw it towards Troy. The window in front of Troy opened, emitting two strong beams of light that resembled eyes. [Yang Luchan] was completely puzzled and could only try to flip one of the switches. Suddenly, Troy lit up all over, and its claws lifted abruptly.
1:5:37|1:5:49|[Yang Luchan] is having a great time at the moment, trying different ways to flip the switches inside, accidentally mimicking the exact Tai Chi gestures of the maid outside, which is quite comical.
1:5:49|1:6:1|On the other side, Fang Zijing ultimately failed to keep Claire and could only carry her luggage to the door, waiting for the carriage together. The carriage soon arrived and stopped in front of them. Fang Zijing gallantly took Claire's hand and helped her into the carriage.
1:6:1|1:6:7|Fang Zijing felt very reluctant in the face of Claire's silence, and looked at her affectionately, saying that he would definitely go to her hometown to find her after the railway was built.
1:6:9|1:6:18|Clara could not hide her inner sadness. She glanced quietly at Fang Zijing beside her, silently bowing her head to indicate that if Fang Zijing truly cared about their future together, he should walk with her.
1:6:19|1:6:31|While Fang Zijing and Claire were still entangled in their emotions, [Chen Yuniang] had already searched through the interior of Troy. She held up the blueprint and compared it over and over again, finally spotting the hidden lock in the center of the second floor that matched the blueprint exactly.
1:6:31|1:6:42|However, a sudden turn of events disrupted their plan. A soldier struggled to crawl to the emergency button and pressed it with the last bit of strength, causing Troy to instantly start flashing with dazzling light.
1:6:43|1:6:52|Yang Luchan in the cockpit immediately rushed over upon hearing the sound, and together with Chen Yuniang, they checked the blueprint. After confirming it was correct, Chen Yuniang reached out her hand and turned the mechanism in the direction indicated on the blueprint.
1:6:52|1:7:4|With Chen Yuniang's movements, the clasps merged step by step according to the blueprint. When the final switch was merged, the gate suddenly opened, revealing a dense array of gears in front of the two. It seemed that this was the central system of Troy.
1:7:17|1:7:38|[Chen Yuniang] gritted her teeth and inserted the iron rod in her hand into the still rotating gears. As the gears jammed, the dial instantly reached its limit. A large amount of steam gushed out, causing even the ground to tremble, and the scattered explosives were particularly frightening. Sensing the danger, [Fang Zijing] grabbed [Clara] and ran out.
1:7:38|1:7:50|At the same time, [Chen Yuniang] dragged [Yang Luchan] in another direction and ran off, while [Fang Zijing] chose to go down to the ground floor from the second floor through the back door. However, the explosives were lying in the cargo hold on the ground floor, already ignited by the trembling flames.
1:7:50|1:7:56|There could be an explosion at any time. [Chen Yuniang] is pulling [Yang Luchan] towards the top deck's cockpit, intending to escape through the cabin door.
1:7:56|1:8:8|The fuse quickly burned to the end, and the bombs started to explode one after another, with dazzling sparks everywhere. [Yang Luchan] and [Chen Yuniang] fearlessly rushed forward, but [Clara] was not so lucky, as the strong impact from the explosion
1:8:8|1:8:24|Fang Zijing threw her to the side with a pole. Old Zhao quickly turned around and helped the injured Claire limp outside. At this moment, the interior of Troy was filled with burning flames, thick smoke, and steam. If this continued, its own explosion was only a matter of time.
1:8:24|1:8:31|[Chen Yuniang] rushed into the cockpit with [Yang Luchan] to find the location of the cabin door, while the flames behind them kept reaching out, trying to engulf them.
1:8:31|1:8:43|[Fang Zijing] and Claire were the first to find the exit, but hesitated whether to jump down. [Chen Yuniang] and [Yang Luchan] had already been forced to jump down by the flames in the cockpit. As [Yang Luchan] and [Chen Yuniang] landed simultaneously, the outer shell of Troy kept expanding.
1:8:43|1:8:54|Several rivets were sprayed out. Finally, unable to withstand the high temperature pressure, the internal core exploded first. [Yang Luchan] and [Chen Yuniang] desperately ran out, and on the way, they even remembered to pick up the provocative maid who was challenging Troy.
1:8:54|1:9:13|At one moment, metal parts scattered everywhere, and Troy exploded completely. The three were knocked down by the huge impact, and the iron claws also descended from the sky, encircling them in the center until the last moment when [Fang Zijing] and Claire managed to escape, falling to the ground weakly. The final glory of Troy disappeared along with the splashing sparks, leaving only a pile of metal parts.
1:9:13|1:9:37|Under the iron claws, the kind-hearted [Yang Luchan] immediately protected the young Zhao Di. With a dirty face, he looked at the unharmed Zhao Di with the most sincere smile. However, [Chen Yuniang] was knocked unconscious by the explosion's aftermath. [Yang Luchan] then lifted [Chen Yuniang]'s body and walked towards the village with Zhao Di in big strides. On the other side, [Fang Zijing] struggled to prop up his body, looking at the unprecedented confusion revealed in the ruins. He struggled to get up.
1:9:37|1:9:55|Knocked down again by the aftermath of the explosion, [Fang Zijing] stared with wide eyes at the repeated explosions of Troy in front of him, but he had no way to stop it. He knelt forward and took a few steps, looking at the remains of Troy, a hint of tears in his eyes. This was his only hope, ultimately destroyed in this accident.
1:10:0|1:10:25|Clara tried to get up but couldn't muster the strength, so she weakly reached out her hand to [Fang Zijing]. It was only then that [Fang Zijing] realized her presence, and he crawled over, embracing her in his arms. However, Clara's chest was already soaked with blood, leaving [Fang Zijing] in deep sorrow as he trembled while covering her wound.
1:10:27|1:10:37|Clara weakly lifted her head and looked affectionately at [Fang Zijing], who tried to force a smile to comfort Clara.
1:10:37|1:10:56|After hearing the satisfactory answer, Claire joyfully held his hand and affectionately rubbed her cheek against his, [Fang Zijing] also looked at Claire in his arms with unprecedented tenderness. Claire's movements became slower and slower, and finally she tilted her head and fell into his arms. [Fang Zijing] panicked, trembling as he shook Claire's body but received no response.
1:11:1|1:11:20|After the roar, [Fang Zijing] once again fell into deep powerlessness. Now the only thing he could do was to tightly hold the still-warm body of Claire in his arms. On the other side, the door of [Chen Yuniang]'s house was opened, and several elders filed out. At this moment, no one knew what had happened, they could only watch alertly towards the village entrance.
1:12:12|1:12:20|A man in a white robe walked out of the ancestral hall and approached [Yang Luchan]. This was the laborer uncle mentioned by [Yang Luchan].
1:13:19|1:13:35|The group prepared for the battle, with [Chen Changxing] standing on the steps, looking solemnly at everyone. The villagers always followed the orders of the sect leader first, so they immediately started preparing. They silently packed their bags, lined up, and left the village. However, the children, who did not understand what was happening, were reluctant to leave home and cried loudly.
1:13:46|1:13:53|At this moment, [Chen Village] showed an extraordinary unity, and the steamed bun shop had already prepared and distributed food to the villagers in an orderly manner.
1:14:19|1:14:39|Soon the villagers created some special weapons. They mixed coal ash, tea leaves, cow dung, and camphor with water, stewed them into a paste over a high flame, poured them into molds, dried them, wrapped them in tobacco leaves, lit them on fire, and thick white smoke instantly filled the air. The smoke contained arsenic trioxide, which, when inhaled, would cause slight dizziness and blurred sense of direction, and in severe cases, hallucinations.
1:14:39|1:14:51|The villagers covered their mouths and noses, walking around with burning smoke blocks. Soon the entire village was shrouded in thick smoke, making it impossible to see the road clearly. This was the first tactic employed by [Chen Changxing], using deception to confuse the enemy.
1:14:51|1:15:1|Soon, [Fang Zijing] led the Qing soldiers to break into [Chen Family Valley]. He slowly led his horse towards the remnants of Troy not far away, a moment that reminded him of his hatred towards [Chen Family Valley].
1:15:1|1:15:12|[Chen Changxing] stood on the top of the watchtower, quietly observing the movements of the Qing soldiers below. He saw them holding long spears, walking cautiously in a row of four towards the street. In the blink of an eye, the majority of the street was already filled with Qing soldiers.
1:15:12|1:15:25|Chen Changxing saw that the time was right, so he flicked the stone in his hand towards the wind vane. As the wind vane turned, Tofu Brother, who received the signal, leaped lightly onto the roof with a bunch of Luo Han Guo. The smoke began to take effect, and Fang Zijing instinctively covered his mouth and nose.
1:15:26|1:15:47|The smoke made the visibility extremely low, although the soldiers were vigilant and looking around, they still couldn't see that the doors and windows on both sides of the streets had quietly opened. This was the second strategy: using yin to control yang. Suddenly, countless watermelons, mangoes, and other fruits attacked from all directions, causing the soldiers to panic. Although the fruits were not lethal, their impact was not to be underestimated. Some soldiers even lost their front teeth.
1:15:47|1:15:58|The triplet sisters held lotus seeds on the second-floor terrace and squeezed them out, shooting them in unison at the soldiers below. The soldiers were bombarded by the flying lotus seeds and were momentarily at a loss on how to dodge them. After the lotus seeds were shot out, ...
1:15:58|1:16:18|Villagers immediately threw prepared corn, radishes, and other items at the soldiers. Before the soldiers could react, Tofu Brother unleashed a powerful move, lifting his leg and flinging the tree branch in his hand towards the soldiers' legs, causing the loquat fruits on it to instantly shoot out and knock down a group of soldiers. Meanwhile, Chen Yuniang's skills were even more amazing, as she created a slingshot as tall as a person and exerted all her strength to pull the bowstring taut.
1:16:18|1:16:30|At the moment she released the bowstring, three pumpkins shot out like thunder, knocking down a group of soldiers. The villager who had just thrown the fruits agilely flipped over the wall, picked up a nearby stool, and smashed it towards the soldiers.
1:16:30|1:16:41|The dual attack of smoke and fruit left the soldiers dizzy and disoriented, causing them to flee without any resistance. [Chen Youzhi]'s moves made the situation even worse for the soldiers, as she skillfully utilized her techniques.
1:16:41|1:16:52|Casually flicking the eggs in the basket, the fresh eggs instantly smeared a soldier's face, making it impossible for him to even open his eyes. And with the help of Chen-style martial arts, Brother Tofu easily knocked down several soldiers in just a few moves.
1:16:52|1:17:5|Villagers standing on the grass platform picked up fruits from the baskets and threw them down continuously, but for the first time, none hit anyone. The general in golden armor stood with a cold face, dodging the thrown fruits, and then drew his long sword to chop the flying fruits into pieces.
1:17:8|1:17:21|The soldier who received the order immediately calmed down and started shooting around. The fruits were powerless against real weapons, and the villagers were forced to flee. Unexpectedly, one villager failed to escape and was shot directly.
1:17:23|1:17:30|Chen Changxing didn't hesitate, he rushed straight down from the watchtower, and before Old Zhao fell off the high platform, he grabbed the back of his neck and pulled him back.
1:17:31|1:17:37|Fang Zijing suppressed his hatred, gritted his teeth, and rode forward as soldiers filled the gaps with bullets.
1:18:3|1:18:23|[Chen Yuniang] remained calm in the face of danger, with her hands on her hips blocking the entrance to the ancestral hall. Even when the soldier's long spear was against her neck, she did not back down. Meanwhile, [Fang Zijing] had nothing but anger in his eyes, no longer showing the warmth of the past. Just as the soldiers were about to leave after subduing [Chen Yuniang], she took the initiative to grab the spear at her neck and directly hit the soldier's forehead, then swiftly dealt with the surrounding people using her unique Tai Chi martial arts techniques.
1:18:23|1:18:42|Only [Yang Luchan] silently observed the movements around [Chen Yuniang]. He leaped down from the watchtower, landing directly on the shoulders of two soldiers. Unable to bear the weight, the soldiers fell to one side. After landing, [Yang Luchan] deftly opened the soldier's long spear, demonstrating the formidable Chen family boxing techniques, instantly defeating a group of opponents.
1:18:42|1:18:53|On the other side, [Chen Yuniang] acted decisively, and the soldiers couldn't get close for half a day. Seeing this, the general snatched a soldier's long spear and aimed it at [Chen Yuniang].
1:18:56|1:19:5|[Yang Luchan] only had time to open his arms to shield [Chen Yuniang], before a bullet pierced through his left shoulder, leaving a bloody wound.
1:19:10|1:19:19|The dark muzzles lined up in a row, all aimed at [Chen Yuniang] and [Yang Luchan]. At this moment, Chen Changxing flew down and threw a string of corn forward, instantly blocking all the bullets.
1:19:20|1:19:28|Third Uncle quickly hid behind the wall and also turned [Chen Youzhi], who was standing foolishly, around. Chen Changxing then made the final move: the unity of heaven and man, only to see Fang Zijing wave his hand,
1:19:30|1:19:43|The soldiers were ordered to stab Chen Changxing with their guns, but Chen Changxing grabbed the gun with one hand, slid his hand to the end of the gun, and then elbowed a soldier down. He stepped out a Tai Chi Bagua formation, skillfully turned the long spear with mysterious techniques, and knocked down the crowd again with the butt of the gun.
1:19:43|1:19:53|For Old Zhao and others like him, dealing with a group of unruly soldiers is as easy as pie, but his true purpose is not in killing, but in protecting a pure land.
1:19:53|1:20:9|Soldiers couldn't keep up with the elusive speed of [Chen Youzhi], only seeing fallen soldiers in his wake. Before the soldiers could even load their bullets, the guns had already slipped from their hands. [Chen Youzhi] was unarmed, yet he effortlessly maneuvered through the army, sweeping through them wherever he went.
1:20:9|1:20:16|The soldiers held their long spears nervously on guard, but no one knew who [Chen Youzhi] would appear next to in the next second.
1:20:16|1:20:28|Facing the long spears thrusting towards him by three soldiers simultaneously, [Chen Youzhi] calmly extended his hand and waved it, deflecting the weapons while striking the three men with consecutive palms. Before long, the open space in front of the ancestral hall was filled with soldiers lying on the ground, clutching their heads and wailing.
1:20:28|1:20:39|There was no bloodshed, [Chen Youzhi] raised two long spears, used internal force to deeply break and throw them out, then he leaped up and directly pressured the general, who had not yet raised his long sword.
1:20:39|1:20:50|[Chen Youzhi] was kicked off the horse by a kick. In the end, [Chen Youzhi] locked his gaze on [Fang Zijing], the result of this battle caught [Fang Zijing] off guard, facing [Chen Youzhi] at this moment made him even more uneasy.
1:20:52|1:21:2|[Chen Youzhi] once again leaped up, directly mounting [Fang Zijing]'s horse and facing him. [Fang Zijing] was so scared that he kept leaning back. By this time, the Qing soldiers were already exhausted, with no more room for resistance.
1:21:2|1:21:9|The villagers took the opportunity to rush forward and drive the soldiers out. Facing the cold and frosty Chen Youzhi, Fang Zijing became more and more flustered and pretended to be calm as he spoke.
1:21:10|1:21:20|[Chen Youzhi] paid no attention to [Fang Zijing]'s feeble explanation. He grabbed the hem of [Fang Zijing]'s robe at the waist and threw him backwards, causing [Fang Zijing] to fly out in a sorry state.
1:21:20|1:21:31|After landing, he slid forward for a long distance, and finally the Qing soldiers helped [Fang Zijing] out of the village like a bereaved dog. Led by [Chen Youzhi], a large group of villagers walked out with victorious steps.
1:21:31|1:21:41|Everyone's face was filled with a happy smile, [Yang Luchan] propped up his body to watch the whole process. After everything settled down, he couldn't hold on any longer and fainted with his head tilted to one side.
1:21:42|1:21:48|The combination of the Three Flowers Gathering on Top poison, along with the consecutive fights and the shoulder-piercing injury, has put [Yang Luchan]'s life in jeopardy at the moment.
1:21:49|1:21:56|In the village, peace has returned as [Yang Luchan] is bound to a stretcher in the Chen family ancestral hall, with only the slight rise and fall of his chest reminding everyone that he is still alive.
1:22:28|1:22:35|Old Zhao frowned and looked at Chen Changxing beside him. Chen Changxing stood up and looked at the family members in the room with his hands behind his back.
1:22:50|1:22:57|Third Uncle looked sternly at the clan members, then glanced at [Yang Luchan] who was tied up like a rice dumpling.
1:23:35|1:23:45|Third Uncle Ancestor heard this with even more anger on his face.
1:23:54|1:24:5|Chen Changxing bowed respectfully in front of the ancestral tablet on the table. He then turned around and looked earnestly at Old Zhao.
1:24:56|1:25:6|Chen Yuniang was shocked and quickly walked up to Chen Changxing, whispering to him.
1:25:11|1:25:31|Seeing that You Zhi had taken out the ancestral treasure sword, [Chen Yuniang] understood her father's intention in a flash. She stood at the door, looking into the breeze, and listened to [Yang Luchan]'s painful gasps, lost in thought. Waves of memories flooded back, filling [Chen Yuniang]'s heart to the brim. After a long while, she turned around and looked at the unconscious [Yang Luchan].
1:25:31|1:25:42|When they first met, [Yang Luchan] was knocked over by [Fang Zijing]'s terrible driving skills. At that time, [Yang Luchan] was dizzy, but [Fang Zijing] didn't care at all. Later, due to impatience with [Yang Luchan]'s inquiries about the Chen family's martial arts, she casually pointed in a direction.
1:25:42|1:25:50|Trying to break free, [Yang Luchan] showed his most innocent smile to himself at that time. Later, [Yang Luchan] realized he had been deceived and ran to the teahouse to question.
1:25:50|1:26:2|He had to fight back, not once leaving [Yang Luchan] in a sorry state, yet he remained true to his original intentions without backing down. At that moment, [Fang Zijing] angrily smashed the phonograph, severing their last tie, as [Fang Zijing] disregarded their past friendship.
1:26:2|1:26:13|During the attack on the village by Troy, it was [Yang Luchan] who fought alongside her to save the villagers. And now [Yang Luchan] lies here on the brink of death, all because he took a fatal bullet meant for [Fang Zijing].
1:26:13|1:26:32|At this moment, Uncle San drew his precious sword, pointing it directly at [Yang Luchan], who was still unconscious and unaware that his fate had been easily decided. Thinking of this, [Chen Yuniang]'s expression became extremely resolute as she looked at [Yang Luchan], with a hint of unusual affection in her eyes.
1:26:37|1:26:51|[Chen Youzhi] closed his eyes and let out a sigh, with a faint smile appearing at the corner of his mouth. The whole room was silent, everyone dared not make a sound, quietly watching this father and daughter.
1:26:52|1:27:15|[Chen Youzhi] lifted his foot and walked out, after [Chen Yuniang] decisively confirmed the matter, she also followed [Chen Youzhi] out of the ancestral hall, leaving everyone in the room stunned. Third Uncle looked outside in shock, unable to recover for a while. Eventually, he sighed with a furrowed brow and put the precious sword back on the altar. In this way, [Yang Luchan] not only learned the Chen family's boxing to save his own life, but also unexpectedly won the beauty.
1:27:15|1:27:30|[Chen Yuniang] quickly rushed out of the ancestral hall, but suddenly stopped in her tracks. Then she turned back again to calm her emotions at the moment. Meanwhile, in front of the Taoist official, there was an apparatus with interlocking gears inside, which simultaneously drove a pointer to swing rhythmically.
1:28:5|1:28:12|And [Fang Zijing] paid no attention to the scolding from the magistrate, just tightly clenched his fists.
1:28:14|1:28:26|At this moment, Chenjiagou is very lively, with the streets hung with festive lanterns. The procession carries welcoming flags high, joyfully passing through the market center, while villagers gather on both sides of the road curiously watching.
1:28:26|1:28:37|Everyone's face was filled with joyful smiles, while [Chen Yuniang] was dressed in a gorgeous wedding gown, covered with a green veil sitting in the middle of the sedan chair. The mischievous bridesmaid couldn't help but lift the sedan curtain.
1:28:39|1:28:57|Chen's second sister-in-law hurriedly pulled Zhao Di aside, sneaking a glance at [Chen Yuniang], then lowered the curtain. Through the veil, she vaguely saw [Chen Yuniang] with her eyes downcast, showing no joy on the day of her wedding. At the village entrance, lanterns were hung and even on the remnants of Troy, there were red strings symbolizing happiness.
1:28:57|1:29:10|Uncle Qin was as usual guarding the entrance of the village, but unexpectedly two uninvited guests arrived at this moment. The man in the lead wore a bamboo hat that covered most of his face, only revealing his slightly pursed lips. His long robe was casually draped over his shoulders, giving him a disheveled appearance.
1:29:10|1:29:26|The woman's face was hidden under a black veil, with a beautiful appearance but cold as ice. Qingbo was originally playing mahjong, but as soon as he sensed the presence of the two, he immediately put away his smile, turned his head and looked to the side. The next second, [Old Zhao] was already standing with hands behind his back at the village gate blocking the way for the two.
1:29:26|1:29:33|However, they continued to move forward calmly until they were only two meters away from [Old Zhao] before stopping.
1:29:42|1:30:4|The man's lips curled up without a trace of retreat, [Old Zhao] noticed and responded with a polite smile, though he wasted no time in immediately assuming the starting posture of the Chen Family Fist. The man took two steps back, slowly sinking down with hands resting on his knees, forming a sturdy horse stance. The woman remained standing quietly on the side, making no movements.
1:30:4|1:30:14|Suddenly the man lifted both feet, brought his legs together, pushed his palms back, and flew towards [Old Zhao] with force. [Old Zhao] immediately leaned back to dodge, narrowly avoiding being grazed on the cheek by the man's shoe sole.
