0:7:35|0:7:56|Li Jiang withdrew his gaze and silently smoked a cigarette. He looked at [Wu Lin] with a hint of doubt, only to see him take out an urn from his bag and place it heavily on the round table. Li Jiang took a puff of smoke, stood up woodenly, and slowly lifted the urn with his hands, pressing his forehead against the opening, unable to hold back his tears.
0:8:11|0:8:25|[Wu Lin] was doing a handstand on top of a crystal ashtray, sweat dripping continuously from his wet hairline. With legs in iron shoes spread apart to both sides, Li Jiang looked at him, lost in memories.
0:8:31|0:8:39|Young Li Jiang knelt on the ground, I, [Iron-leg Master], will never spare those who steal and rob like chickens and dogs.
0:9:0|0:9:25|Li Jiang, who is thin and weak, lies in the rain with visible scars all over his body. In a dark hall, various armors are displayed, and in a side hall, there is a huge iron cage where a tiger leisurely walks inside. There is still half a piece of raw meat under the tiger's feet, but it pays no attention to it. Its eyes are fixed on the outside of the cage. Sitting beside the hall is an old man with white beard and hair, [Fomian].
0:9:25|0:9:34|Wearing round-framed sunglasses on the bridge of his nose, a mysterious figure with a cane sat on the central dragon chair, while a man with long hair knelt in the middle of the hall begging for mercy.
0:9:36|0:9:52|Sitting on the dragon throne with a top hat on his head is [Fomian], as the eight-faced star approaches.
0:9:56|0:10:15|The white-bearded [Master] frowned, and the scar-faced villain fired a shot at the person kneeling beside him. The person fell to the ground, and two bodyguards rushed forward, each grabbing a leg and dragging him to the iron cage in the side hall. Inside the cage, a tiger was dozing, but as soon as it saw someone approaching, it immediately pounced towards him.
0:10:15|0:10:43|On the undulating hills by the river, the cold city of Linjiang has erected a steel forest, with tall and dense buildings shrouded in the thin mist from the river. A fortress-like building with a tiger head emblem hangs above the entrance, and the high walls on both sides of the gate are inscribed with the words "loyal to its master, willing to sacrifice one's life" in eight large characters. Three luxury cars are parked in front of the gate. Li Jiang, wearing sunglasses, gets out of the car from the left side and walks around to [Wu Lin]'s side. After Wu Lin gets out of the car, he looks up at the tiger head emblem above.
0:10:43|0:11:3|Li Jiang put his arm around his shoulder and walked towards the door. The heavy King Kong door slowly opened from both sides, and two rows of black-clad bodyguards stood neatly on both sides of the passage. Li Jiang walked in front with his hands in his pockets, leading the way into the security checkpoint, with the laser array shining on [Wu Lin].
0:11:4|0:11:10|[Wu Lin] was stopped by the security guard for a check, and he and Li Jiang both looked down at the iron shoes on their feet.
0:11:10|0:11:44|[Wu Lin] looked up at [Li Jiang], who smiled at him and gestured to the bodyguards to let them pass. [Li Jiang] then put his arm around [Wu Lin] and walked into the training ground. Standing at the edge of zone A, [Li Jiang] watched as the bodyguards followed orders and practiced boxing in unison. Suddenly, a man with an O-shaped beard appeared, reminding [Li Jiang] that a client had arrived. He was [Fu Tou], [Li Jiang]'s assistant. [Li Jiang] continued to pace back and forth among the bodyguards in the training ground.
0:11:44|0:12:19|After observing for a while, [Li Jiang] calmly smiled and gestured for [Li Jiang] to look behind him. [Fu Tou] brought a person holding a stone tablet, with [Giant King Kong] followed by [Iron-head King Kong] and [Fighting King Kong] appearing behind him. [Giant King Kong] glared angrily, while [Iron-head King Kong] did a somersault and stood on his head on the stone tablet. [Giant King Kong] then smashed down on [Iron-head King Kong]'s feet, splitting the stone tablet in half instantly. [Fighting King Kong] continuously kicked at [Iron-head King Kong]'s abdomen, causing [Li Jiang] to look away in disgust.
0:12:19|0:12:27|The crowd heard the dog barking and turned back, only to see [Wu Lin] sitting on the wall of the dog cage, teasing the dog with a piece of bread tied to a rope.
0:13:8|0:13:22|[Wu Lin] turned and left calmly, while [Li Jiang] lowered his gaze, staring intently at the iron shoes on [Wu Lin]'s feet. His eyes twitched slightly as he sat with his hands on his shoulders in the luxurious box. After [Li Jiang] swallowed the pill, he asked him.
0:13:31|0:13:56|[Wu Lin] couldn't help but smile faintly, looking out the window. The booming music in the nightclub was deafening, and the dazzling lights were confusing. [Li Feifei] sat in a booth filled with bottles of alcohol, wearing a tight-fitting dress and heavy makeup on her face. She kept drinking without looking back, tearing up a photo of herself and her ex and throwing the pieces into the air.
0:14:3|0:14:29|[Li Jiang] led [Wu Lin] into this nightclub. He felt uncomfortable with the lights after taking off his glasses, so he had to squint and look around for his daughter. As [Li Jiang] and [Wu Lin] passed by the bar, they saw a man in black carrying a woman. [Li Jiang] looked up and indeed saw [Li Feifei]. With a left hook, [Wu Lin] knocked down the bald leader and crushed the bottle that was thrown at them.
0:14:29|0:14:54|The young man was hit by [Wu Lin] and flew out, ending the dispute hastily. Inside the villa, [Li Jiang] always sat beside the sleeping [Li Feifei]. In no time, he picked up his bag and got into a luxury car. The first light of dawn pierced through the clouds as the sun rose from the horizon. The mist on the glass door of the bathroom reflected the graceful figure of [Li Feifei] as she walked out wrapped in a towel.
0:14:54|0:15:12|With damp long hair tied behind her head, [Li Feifei] let her hair down, with a few unique highlights in her black hair. She took out a bottle of tea from the fridge and saw in the mirror on the fridge that the bottle fell from [Li Feifei]'s hand to the ground, and her towel also slipped off.
0:15:17|0:15:25|[Li Feifei] angrily threw away her phone, tossed a stack of money on the coffee table, and sat down fiercely.
0:15:50|0:16:0|[Wu Lin] lowered his eyelids without saying a word, [Li Feifei] stood up and paced back and forth, impatiently rubbing her hair. It was like a sudden inspiration, and she sat back down next to [Wu Lin].
0:16:11|0:16:18|[Li Feifei] took the cushion and placed it on her lap.
0:17:3|0:17:30|[Li Feifei] stood up speechlessly and left. In no time, she was driving and shouting, "You think you can be a bodyguard? You can't even drive!" She drove a Pontiac sports car and glanced at [Wu Lin]. [Wu Lin] looked at her, extended his hand pointing forward. [Li Feifei] turned her head and continued driving, her subtle expression hidden behind sunglasses. There were gropers on the square, and the gang leader kicked people around.
0:17:39|0:17:46|[Li Feifei] smiled charmingly and gave the leader a slap, then pointed to [Wu Lin] who was leaving gracefully behind her. [Wu Lin] explained.
0:17:49|0:18:13|[Li Feifei] ran frantically and quickly sought help from [Wu Lin]. [Li Feifei] complained that the thugs were chasing her. She rushed down the spiral staircase and quickly realized her mistake when she turned back. [Li Feifei] fell on the stairs, while [Wu Lin] swiftly grabbed the leader by the neck.
0:18:27|0:18:40|[Wu Lin] held the leader up to the railing, the leader hanging in the air begging for mercy. The night on the riverbank was bustling, with the towering skyscrapers shimmering in the flowing light and shadow.
0:18:40|0:19:8|A stunning beauty with a towering figure walked towards [Wu Lin] in strappy high heels. She was wearing a low-cut dress, her hand first resting on her ample bosom, lifting the waves of her side profile. [Wu Lin] looked at her with vacant eyes as the beauty spun in front of him. Her circular necklace and tassel earrings seemed to shine even brighter. With a seductive gaze and slightly parted lips, she approached [Wu Lin], lifting the curls behind her head and swaying her waist.
0:19:8|0:19:23|The beauty looked at [Wu Lin] with shiny eyes, approaching it like a little wild cat. This angle allowed [Wu Lin] to have a full view of her charm. The beauty climbed onto [Wu Lin]'s knee, continuing to sway her waist to showcase her allure.
0:19:23|0:19:42|The beauty stood up and used her fingertips to touch [Wu Lin]'s face, then gently lifted his chin with her finger pads, making eye contact with him. When [Wu Lin] looked into her eyes, she turned around, slid her hands along the curve of her waist to his perky buttocks, and then sat on [Wu Lin]'s thigh.
0:19:42|0:20:7|The beauty suddenly froze, her eyes staring blankly at [Wu Lin]. [Wu Lin] had a hint of a mysterious smile at the corner of his mouth, looking at the beauty's hand reaching towards his crotch, slowly raising his eyes to watch the beauty's reaction like watching a show. The beauty's hand seemed to touch something, her eyes gradually changing from doubt to incredulity. She nervously swallowed, immediately stood up in a panic and rushed down the stairs.
0:20:7|0:20:20|[Wu Lin] smiled smugly, took out a copper scroll tube from his waist, and a beautiful woman rushed down the corridor, panting, and grabbed [Li Feifei]'s hand.
0:20:24|0:20:59|[Wu Lin] lurked in the courtyard of the villa, looking at the jungle sneakily. [Li Feifei] stood by the window, hands on hips, watching him. In the dead of night, as all sounds faded away, [Wu Lin] as usual performed a suspended split and entered the dream world. A little girl in a white dress ran into the garden, while a man in a shirt and vest led a boy towards the woods at the foot of the mountain. The boy had a cloud tattoo on the inside of his forearm. They reached the edge of a cliff, and as the distance between them and the cliff shortened,
0:20:59|0:21:22|Wu Lin's sweat kept dripping, and in front of the glass door pushed open by the girl in white skirt on the balcony was actually a woman in a long dress hanging, at the cliff edge, the man also threw the boy into the abyss, Li Feifei and Wu Lin woke up from the dream at the same time, at this time, several black-clothed men sneaked into the garden outside the villa, the only person wearing a white mask held his companion's shoulder.
0:21:22|0:21:32|He noticed the steel wire hanging in the air and gestured for everyone to retreat. Inside the house, [Wu Lin] noticed the bell on the steel wire swaying slightly in the dim hall,
0:21:44|0:22:9|Standing aside, the fair-skinned old man said, "[Bamian Shaxing]," then continued, "[Fomian]" slowly stood up in front of the iron cage, pointing a gun at the white-bearded man. With a furrowed brow, [Fomian] stared intently. Inside the cage, the tiger leisurely chewed on sinewy meat, while the white-bearded man lay in a pool of blood.
0:22:9|0:22:25|Bamian Shaxing glanced at Fomian, then quickly averted his gaze. His pupils were trembling uncontrollably out of fear, and his jaw muscles were clenched.
0:22:25|0:22:50|In a star-rated restaurant in Lengcheng, a waiter in a white shirt and black bow tie smiled and bowed, but [Wu Lin] in front of him stared at him coldly without any gratitude. The waiter's mouth twitched awkwardly in response to [Wu Lin]. [Li Feifei] looked disdainfully at [Wu Lin] as he continued to enjoy his steak. A female waiter carrying red wine walked down the stairs and approached [Li Feifei] with a tray.
0:22:50|0:22:56|Pouring a little red wine into his tall glass, [Wu Lin] suddenly pressed the waitress down on the table.
0:23:11|0:23:28|The manager took a sip from the wine glass, [Li Feifei] glanced at [Wu Lin], [Wu Lin] looked at the year on the wine bottle and said, the manager was stunned after hearing this, [Li Feifei] was so angry that she couldn't speak and glared at [Wu Lin], then slammed the table and left, cursing loudly in the restroom.
0:23:48|0:24:2|Li Feifei accidentally fell from [Wu Lin], who quickly scanned around. Li Feifei sat on the ground crying and pleading.
0:24:12|0:24:40|[Wu Lin] was surrounded by a group of men, and Li Feifei quickly slipped away. The two waiters in the restaurant dragged Li Feifei into a car, and when they saw [Wu Lin] about to rush over, the men immediately grabbed him. [Wu Lin] punched those men into the fountain, and the cold-blooded female King Kong in leather ran over and delivered a spinning kick to [Wu Lin], then continuously slashed at him with a knife. [Wu Lin] threw her into the fountain, and by the time the cold-blooded King Kong got up, he had already run far away.
0:24:40|0:25:6|[Wu Lin] jumped over the green belt and rushed onto the road to hijack Li Feifei's van. Coincidentally, the white masked man who visited the garden at night last time was sitting in the car. [Wu Lin] ran desperately behind the van, while two attendants tightly covered Li Feifei's mouth. The driver suddenly shifted gears and stepped on the gas pedal. Seeing this, [Wu Lin] ran up the overpass, and saw the van speeding under the bridge. He quickly crossed the bridge and leaped down from the railing.
0:25:6|0:25:27|Steadily landing on the roof of the car, unexpectedly there was a bridge tunnel with a height limit of two meters ahead. [Wu Lin] instantly lay flat as the car entered the tunnel, and as it emerged from the tunnel, immediately performed a carp stance lying on the roof of the car. The van drove into the crowded traffic, desperately swerving to shake off [Wu Lin], aggressively changing lanes. Suddenly, the car turned into the non-motorized vehicle lane, recklessly weaving through.
0:25:27|0:25:43|Wu Lin, who directly knocked over the road cones in the restricted area, still firmly clung to the roof of the van. The driver violently turned the steering wheel, causing the van to sway left and right on the road. Although Wu Lin held onto the roof, his legs were swinging wildly, resembling windshield wipers in the rain.
0:25:50|0:26:16|[Wu Lin] quickly got up and chased after, the van rushed towards Lu Chuan, driving straight into the corridor of the commercial street. [Wu Lin] ran to the iron ladder outside the building, the van happened to pass by below. He quickly jumped down from the iron ladder, flipped over the giant signboard outside the building, floated from the window to the cabinet on the third floor of the mall, safely landing with a somersault. [Wu Lin] followed the direction of the van, running and jumping all the way to the railing on the third-floor walkway.
0:26:16|0:26:34|The masked man in the car looked up, [Wu Lin] suddenly stopped, leaped from the third floor to the corridor on the second floor, then jumped from the second floor walkway to the top of the pavilion on the first floor. He flew over the pavilion, jumped down from the edge of the pavilion, and landed heavily on the table in the leisure area.
0:26:34|0:27:4|Seeing the van driving away, he smashed through the flower bed in the leisure area like an iron man, and chased after it. [Wu Lin] ran after the van as it burst out of the open-air mall. The van returned to the road, suddenly slammed on the brakes and stopped. The masked man got out and fixed his gaze on [Wu Lin] standing in the middle of the road with clenched fists. The driver lightly tapped the gas pedal, sweat dripping down [Wu Lin]'s chin as he stared at the driver, who was also sweating profusely.
0:27:4|0:27:9|He suddenly stepped on the gas pedal, and [Wu Lin] fearlessly charged towards the van.
0:27:9|0:27:36|At the moment of the imminent collision, he flew up, legs together, and kicked through the windshield. [Wu Lin] crashed into the back seat, punched the masked man out of the windshield, and threw the two fake waiters out of the side windows. Holding [Li Feifei]'s hand, [Wu Lin] kicked open the trunk, helped [Li Feifei] jump out of the car, and turned to see two more cars of reinforcements behind the masked man. He immediately grabbed [Li Feifei] and fled the scene.
0:27:41|0:27:56|[Li Feifei] ran on the road with 10-centimeter high heels, while [Wu Lin]. The masked men heard the police siren and had to put away their long knives and retreat quickly. [Wu Lin] held [Li Feifei] tightly and ran forward with all his strength, with the bright moon hanging high in the sky.
0:28:42|0:28:59|[Wu Lin] closed his mouth with dissatisfaction, got up and walked towards the room. Little did he know that [Li Feifei] was smiling secretly with pursed lips as he left, like a young girl experiencing her first crush.
0:29:0|0:29:6|On the bedside table in the bedroom, there is a family photo of three people, with the father's face deliberately cut off.
0:29:6|0:29:32|Wearing a nightgown, [Li Feifei] picked up a photo frame with tears in her eyes. She touched her mother's face in the photo with her fingertips. In the photo, her mother was holding her father's arm, and her father was holding a young [Li Feifei]. Looking up, [Li Feifei] had snot and tears all over her face. In the cold financial building, [Bamian Shaxing] sat at the desk with his eyes closed, resting. [Li Jiang] sat on the sofa with a cigar.
0:29:32|0:29:55|You are the person Mr. Wu Lin respects the most in his life. I hope you won't disappoint him. Li Jiang exhaled two puffs of smoke from his nostrils after hearing this. Bamian Shaxing, with an unhappy expression, stood up from the leather chair and walked slowly to Li Jiang's side. He stared down at Li Jiang and warned him,
0:30:0|0:30:18|Bamian Shaxing slowly walked back, Li Jiang's eyes relaxed and then tightened, his hand holding the cigar moved away slightly, as if hesitating about something. On the terrace of the uncertain villa, Wu Lin leaned on the railing with both hands, looking up at the starry night sky, memories flooding into his mind.
0:30:36|0:30:58|The bright and cold sky was vast and white, setting off the lonely and desolate figure of [Wu Lin]. From then on, he practiced day and night on the cliff where he fell in his childhood. The spot where [Wu Lin] practiced was only a step away from the cliff, with a narrow path at his feet that could make one step into the void.
0:30:58|0:31:8|Countless days and nights, under the lingering sunset glow above his head and surrounded by towering mountains at his feet, [Wu Lin] diligently practiced the 108 techniques.
0:31:8|0:31:31|Many years ago, [Master] saved him in the woods and took him as his disciple. He used a branding iron to imprint a martial arts character on his left chest. Under the guidance of [Master], he and his senior brother practiced horse stance, lifted barbells, raised heavy objects with both arms, and caught sandbags on their chests. The difficulty of training increased daily, and they had to jump up at any time while doing a handstand to avoid [Master]'s cane.
0:31:32|0:31:46|The senior brothers carried a tree trunk while also bearing the weight of [Master], [Wu Lin] practiced iron leg skills by hanging upside down, with legs together and head submerged in a pool, holding breath for a long time before performing a split kick in the air and coming up to breathe.
0:31:46|0:32:7|[Wu Lin] chose to practice at the edge of a cliff and in the garden after reaching adulthood. As he finished his moves, a slight frown appeared on his forehead. He remembered the masked man in the van throwing punches at him. He wore a wolf head ring on his middle finger. When he reunited with [Li Jiang] in the cold city, Fu Tou, who was by [Li Jiang]'s side, also wore this ring.
0:32:9|0:32:39|[Wu Lin] suddenly opened his eyes and kicked towards the side, but missed the leaves of the orchid. After he left, the orchid unexpectedly broke off from the middle of the flower mirror. [Wu Lin] arrived at the steel plant, where [Li Jiang] was waiting for him. [Li Jiang] answered with his hands on the railing of the terrace.
0:33:3|0:33:18|[Wu Lin], wearing polarized sunglasses, but his gaze never fell on [Li Jiang]. [Li Jiang] turned and asked him, "Have you fallen in love with that girl?" [Li Jiang] walked straight towards the factory building, with [Wu Lin] following closely after taking off his sunglasses.
0:34:0|0:34:22|His body leaned forward to attack [Wu Lin], who kept retreating step by step, leaning against the iron net like a beehive. [Li Jiang] threw a straight punch at [Wu Lin], but he dodged it, smashing through the factory's electrical box. [Li Jiang] abandoned his boxing technique and kicked towards [Wu Lin]. He locked [Wu Lin]'s neck with both hands, continuously kneeing his abdomen, but was strictly defended against.
0:34:22|0:34:39|[Li Jiang] punched [Wu Lin] onto the iron net, [Wu Lin] half-knelt on the lime bag, his left foot slowly stretched out, his bangs covering one eye, unable to hide the fighting spirit in his eyes. [Wu Lin] stepped on the iron net and flew towards [Li Jiang], his fists falling on [Li Jiang]'s chest like raindrops.
0:34:41|0:34:57|[Wu Lin] threw a heavy punch, but [Li Jiang] dodged to the side. They paused for a few seconds facing each other on their knees. [Li Jiang] grabbed [Wu Lin]'s arm and threw him aside, followed by a powerful kick. [Wu Lin] slid to the wall but quickly got up, as [Li Jiang] continued to attack him with punches and kicks.
0:34:59|0:35:11|[Li Jiang] left a series of fist prints on the wall behind [Wu Lin]. [Wu Lin] landed a punch on [Li Jiang]'s waist, causing him to take three steps up the wall. After spinning in the air, [Wu Lin] kicked [Li Jiang] on the back of his head.
0:35:11|0:35:39|[Li Jiang] rolled several meters away, he quickly got up from the ground, his eyes full of anger. He suddenly tore off a corner of his shirt, [Wu Lin] looked at [Li Jiang] in surprise as he lowered his hands. After [Li Jiang] finished speaking, the muscles on his face twitched, and he stood unsteadily in a five-body posture. [Li Jiang] also stood up, and the two of them silently confronted each other for a while. [Li Jiang] left first.
0:35:39|0:36:10|The torn piece of his clothes still lay on the ground, [Wu Lin] sighed lightly as he watched his departing figure. [Li Feifei] drove [Wu Lin] in the car, memories overlapping as they traveled through the dim tunnel. Surprisingly, the words of his father and [Li Jiang] were strangely similar. [Wu Lin] came to his senses and looked at [Li Feifei], shaking his head wordlessly. The Pontiac raced along the mountain road.
0:36:10|0:36:37|Driving into the distant towering mountains, the sea surface ripples with light and shadow. Not far from the bay, several fishing boats are anchored. [Wu Lin] stands on the terrace of the villa, hands in pockets, gazing at the sea view. [Li Feifei] walks up to him in a silk tank top and chiffon skirt, asking,
0:36:48|0:36:58|The cold city is engulfed by the night, with towering buildings shining brightly and dazzling lights reflecting each other.
0:36:58|0:37:18|[Li Jiang] sat in a leather chair smoking a cigar, reminiscing about his experiences after leaving the mountain. He squatted next to a trash can, fighting with a dog for food. With a command from [Fu Tou], his men rushed towards the Li River with axes in hand. However, Li Jiang displayed his martial arts skills and easily defeated the opponents with just a few simple moves.
0:37:18|0:37:45|[Li Jiang] threw someone into a foam box with an elbow strike, made another person fall heavily in place with a knee jump, then roared and lifted a person to slam him onto a wooden table, which broke instantly. Seeing this, [Fu Tou] got anxious and swung two axes wildly at [Li Jiang]. [Li Jiang] stepped back a few steps, then suddenly locked his neck, followed by a knee strike that flipped him backwards. [Fu Tou] fiercely hit [Li Jiang]'s facade, giving [Li Jiang] the opportunity to jump to an open space.
0:37:45|0:38:10|[Li Jiang] rushed forward and knocked him down with a cross of his fists. [Fu Tou] struggled to prop himself up in the rain. [Li Jiang] slowly approached him, picked up his axe, and [Fu Tou] closed his eyes resignedly. However, [Li Jiang] threw away the axe. At this moment, a glaring car light shone over, a Mercedes stopped in front of everyone. [Fomian] walked slowly with an umbrella and said to [Li Jiang].
0:38:19|0:38:43|[Fu Tou] and another henchman stood in front of [Li Jiang], trying to persuade him, while [Li Jiang] fell into contemplation. [Li Feifei] was curious about [Wu Lin]'s shoes, so she squatted down and touched them.
0:38:51|0:39:6|Several seagulls skimmed over the water as [Wu Lin] and [Li Feifei] stood in the shallows with their feet apart, [Li Feifei] imitated boxing moves like a cat learning to catch mice, and [Wu Lin] helped her adjust her stance step by step.
0:39:9|0:39:14|[Wu Lin] lay flat on the deck, while [Li Feifei] used her index finger to check his breathing.
0:39:30|0:39:45|The two of them spent time together by the sea, like newlyweds on their honeymoon. Li Feifei played with sand in her hands, while Wu Lin stood by and watched. Li Feifei taught Wu Lin how to drive, pushing his head away when he couldn't learn properly.
0:39:45|0:40:7|The two sat by the fishing boat, [Wu Lin] caught a white pomfret, and mischievously scared [Li Feifei] into dropping the crab in her hand. In a daze, [Li Feifei] seemed to have returned to her carefree childhood. [Wu Lin] hugged [Li Feifei] and rode a horse on the beach. [Li Feifei] wore a backless dress, her smile as bright as the clear sky. The two drove on the beach.
0:40:7|0:40:23|The wheels rolled up splashes of water into the sky, the two ran on the colorful trestle bridge. The bridge extended from the beach into the sea, with two platforms at the end stretching out to the left and right. They stood on the platforms, feeling the afterglow of the setting sun.
0:40:23|0:40:46|Li Feifei's long hair was blowing back in the sea breeze, with a gentle and serene expression. The halo of the setting sun enveloped the sea and fishing boats. Wu Lin and Li Feifei stood at the bow of the boat, facing the sea breeze. Wu Lin looked around at the sea view, while Li Feifei, in a white dress, leaned against a post behind him. Both were silent, yet this scene was plain and heartwarming, with the spray of water splashing from the bow.
0:40:46|0:41:3|In the bottom of the boat, it gathered into a white snow. At night, Li Feifei sat on a swing chair, a little absent-minded, while Wu Lin stood up and approached the bonfire, where the wood had long been deformed by the fire.
0:41:3|0:41:19|In the grand hall, a man in a black suit throws several pieces of paper into the brazier. On a nearby chair rests a dragon-headed cane. [Li Jiang] is being pushed into the hall by [Fu Tou], with his hands shackled. He lifts his hands and points at the chair, speaking.
0:41:19|0:41:25|[Li Jiang] was constantly kicked down by [Fu Tou]. At that time, he got into the car in the middle of the night, and the driver with a cap on looked at the rearview mirror.
0:42:10|0:42:34|[Fomian] noticed [Li Jiang]'s hesitation, his eyes were somewhat elusive, still silent. [Wu Lin] stood on the pile of broken stones by the sea, the waves rushing towards the shore, crashing against the rocks, leaving behind strings of silvery white foam.
0:42:34|0:42:45|[Wu Lin] recalled the words that [Li Jiang] said when he chose him back then. That year, [Li Jiang] and Fomian appeared together in the woods behind the back mountain, followed by a group of people.
0:43:36|0:43:59|[Master]'s words struck at [Wu Lin]'s heart. He stood for a long time on the rocky beach, in the arena. [Fu Tou] said, "Brother, they were found by the sea." [Li Jiang] stood in the arena, smoking a cigar. The bodyguard in front of [Li Jiang] brandished a long knife, twirled it twice, and then swung it towards him.
0:43:59|0:44:11|[Li Jiang] flicked away the cigar in his hand, the blade narrowly missing his throat. He grabbed the bodyguard's arm and delivered a hook punch, causing the opponent to step back several paces, the blade grazing his neck.
0:44:11|0:44:36|[Li Jiang] punched the bodyguard in the neck, followed by several more punches, causing the opponent to spit out saliva uncontrollably. The opponents in front of [Li Jiang] kept changing, one was hit and sprayed water from his mouth, another was hit with a double punch and flew out of the fighting arena. A henchman standing outside the arena handed a huge shackle to [Li Jiang], then stepped back to wait at the edge of the arena. [Li Jiang] spoke slowly.
0:44:47|0:45:8|On a stormy night, the bodyguards with machetes and masks arrived at the seaside. The lightning illuminated [Jade-faced King Kong] who led the way. The bodyguards approached the villa, where lights were on but the door was wide open. [Jade-faced King Kong] pulled back the curtains and shouted, while [Wu Lin] and [Li Feifei] escaped through the window. The bodyguards also climbed out of the window to chase after them.
0:45:8|0:45:32|[Wu Lin] is running through the jungle holding hands with [Li Feifei]. Several armed bodyguards block their way, [Wu Lin] fights off the approaching bodyguards while still holding [Li Feifei]'s hand. As two bodyguards charge at him, [Wu Lin] uses both hands to knock them down. One of them seizes [Li Feifei] and carries her away, [Wu Lin] swiftly twists the arm of the bodyguard and kicks his knee, incapacitating him.
0:45:32|0:45:58|[Wu Lin] pressed another person against a tree, twisting his opponent's neck, but he was still grabbed by several people at the legs. [Wu Lin] struck with both fists, causing the two people in front of him to fall down simultaneously. The last bodyguard was also kicked into the mud pit. When [Wu Lin] saw [Li Feifei] being carried away by the black-clothed men, he immediately chased after them. A large construction site was built here, and [Wu Lin] followed the black-clothed men to a warehouse, where the lightning's light shone through the crack in the door.
0:45:58|0:46:20|[Wu Lin] was soaked through by the rain, alertly observing the surroundings. The lightning illuminated the lime on the warehouse, flickering. [Wu Lin] took steps inside, where the ground was covered with lime, pure white. [Wu Lin] glanced around, observing the sides of the warehouse. On the right side, there was a separated Yulu car and abandoned mechanical parts.
0:46:20|0:46:44|[Wu Lin] continued to walk inside, a pair of feet appeared on the iron frame in the sky. Sensing something unusual, [Wu Lin] stopped and listened intently to the surroundings, holding his breath. It was quiet all around, with only occasional thunder from outside. A drop of water fell on [Wu Lin]'s right hand, and he clenched his fist secretly. A man wearing a hammer ring also clenched the iron chain.
0:46:46|0:46:51|Wu Lin's right foot stepped into the trap, and the shackle instantly locked around his ankle.
0:46:51|0:47:11|He squatted down to try to unlock the shackles, but heard a shout, [Fu Tou] jumped from above to the ground and lunged at [Wu Lin]. [Fu Tou] continuously attacked [Wu Lin] with his double axes, then spun around and threw an axe. [Wu Lin] grabbed the iron chain on the axe and pulled [Fu Tou] towards him, kicking him in the air and making him sit on the ground spitting blood, as the other King Kongs rushed over.
0:47:11|0:47:36|[Wu Lin] just turned his head and had a strand of wet hair sliced off by his knife, [Jade-faced King Kong] swung a long knife towards [Wu Lin], [Wu Lin] leaned on a wooden box and jumped up, delivering a flying kick to the head of [Jade-faced King Kong]. [Fighting King Kong] quickly joined the fray, [Wu Lin] blocked [Fighting King Kong]'s leg, faking a move to make him defend, then kicked him down. [Fu Tou] and the other King Kongs rushed in, [Wu Lin] kicked and hammered to fend off the two, but was lifted and slammed to the ground by [Fighting King Kong].
0:49:11|0:49:34|[Wu Lin] spun around to resist the attacks, but was unexpectedly grabbed by [Giant King Kong] and thrown into a wooden box nearby. The box was smashed to pieces by him, and [Giant King Kong] didn't give him a chance to catch his breath. He dragged [Wu Lin] to the open space in the middle with the shackles, and [Cold-blooded King Kong] stabbed towards [Wu Lin] with a knife, only to be kicked away by [Wu Lin]. [Wu Lin]'s legs were immediately captured by [Fighting King Kong] and [Iron-head King Kong].
0:49:34|0:49:42|[Fighting King Kong] took the other shackle and locked it around his left foot, [Wu Lin] immediately lost the advantage and was suspended and beaten by the two of them.
0:49:42|0:50:7|Giant King Kong kicks Wu Lin, sending him flying with his face down on the ground. Jade-faced King Kong rushes in with a knife, but Wu Lin grabs the handle and punches him in the chest. Wu Lin then throws a right hook at Jade-faced King Kong, causing him to spit blood and collapse. Iron-head King Kong charges at Wu Lin, who twists his neck and delivers several heavy punches followed by an elbow and knee strike.
0:50:7|0:50:9|Iron-head King Kong also fell to the ground and couldn't get up.
0:50:11|0:50:38|[Wu Lin], with a sturdy head, took a kick from [Fighting King Kong], staggering a few steps outward. Before he could react, he was hit with a punch to the side of his face, causing ringing in his ears to fill his brain instantly. In a daze, [Wu Lin] managed to block the continuous punches and kicks from [Fighting King Kong]. Seeing him defending himself well, [Fighting King Kong] lifted him up and swung him behind. [Wu Lin] spun in the air before being thrown back to the ground.
0:50:38|0:51:0|[Wu Lin] opened his eyes and prepared to get up, only to see a shocking scene. His eyes widened as he saw [Li Feifei] being tied up with a hemp rope, her hands hanging in the air. [Wu Lin] struggled to get up and stared at [Li Feifei]. The frail [Li Feifei] had her mouth gagged with a cloth and was struggling in pain in the air. [Wu Lin] shouted at her, completely unaware.
0:51:0|0:51:17|This is a trap. [Giant King Kong] walked up to [Wu Lin], slapped him on the back of the head, and [Wu Lin] instantly crashed to the ground, howling in pain. [Giant King Kong] then lifted him up, turned him in a different direction, and threw him onto a giant tire.
0:51:17|0:51:27|[Wu Lin] was just lying on the ground when [Fu Tou] swung his twin axes and rushed towards him, wildly chopping and hacking away.
0:51:27|0:51:49|[Wu Lin] jumped in place, kicking [Fu Tou] away. [Fu Tou] crashed through the windshield and fell into the driver's seat. [Wu Lin] rushed towards [Fighting King Kong], raining punches on his chest. Ignoring the shackles on his feet, [Wu Lin] repeatedly lifted his knee to attack [Fighting King Kong]'s abdomen, then jumped in place and used his knee to knock out [Fighting King Kong]'s head. Immediately after, he punched towards his right face.
0:51:49|0:51:56|The opponent fell to the ground, and Cold-blooded King Kong emerged and tried to stab Wu Lin with a bayonet, but ended up hitting Wu Lin's ankle chain.
0:51:56|0:52:22|Cold-blooded King Kong took the opportunity to kick him down, Giant King Kong stepped forward, lifted Wu Lin with his shackles, Fu Tou sat on the main frame of the car, threw the axe aside, Giant King Kong swung Wu Lin in a half circle and threw him onto the speeding car, Wu Lin lay on the hood of the car, Fu Tou stepped on the gas pedal, rushed towards the cement wall of the warehouse with a suicidal momentum, Li Feifei shook her head in despair.
0:52:25|0:52:46|The car carrying [Wu Lin] crashed through the wall, [Fu Tou] slammed on the brakes, and [Wu Lin] rolled off the hood. Outdoors, flashes of light flickered, thunder rumbled, and large raindrops fell on [Wu Lin]. He curled up in pain, [Cold-blooded King Kong] tightened his grip on his face, inspected it, and then handed him over to [Giant King Kong]. [Giant King Kong] picked up [Wu Lin]'s shackles.
0:52:46|0:52:59|Dragging him out of the factory, [Cold-blooded King Kong] and [Fu Tou] followed closely behind. [Wu Lin] was dragged across the grass by [Giant King Kong], his arms limp at his sides, his mouth opening and closing as if conscious yet at the mercy of others.
0:52:59|0:53:9|[Giant King Kong] dragged him forward without any emotion, [Fu Tou] followed with a look of disgust on his face, the rain poured down heavily, raindrops hitting [Wu Lin]'s face.
0:53:9|0:53:41|Giant King Kong suddenly let go of [Wu Lin]. [Wu Lin] tightly closed his eyes, tilted his head to one side, and bent his legs in pain. Under his feet was a deep pit big enough to bury ten people, with a dozen black-clad men standing by with shovels and hoes. [Wu Lin] struggled to climb up from the muddy ground. [Li Feifei] was held in a reverse lock by Cold-blooded King Kong, who opened a large black umbrella in front of him, under which was [Li Jiang]. [Wu Lin] was drenched in the pouring rain, trembling as he stood up.
0:53:41|0:54:6|Knocked down by a shovel from the person on the right, he stood up again only to be hit in the back by [Fu Tou] on the right, falling to the ground. [Li Jiang] silently smoked a cigar. [Fu Tou] raised the iron shovel high and slammed it on [Wu Lin]'s back, causing him to howl in pain and fall face down into the mud.
0:54:6|0:54:22|[Li Jiang] slowly closed his eyes, recalling the days of martial arts training with [Wu Lin]. While [Master] was dozing off, [Wu Lin] secretly fed him pieces of steamed bun. As [Li Jiang] was expelled from the sect and prepared to leave with his luggage, he said to [Wu Lin],
0:54:25|0:54:50|I will definitely come back to pick you up and [Master]. The two embraced tightly in the pouring rain, [Li Jiang] opened his eyes to see the torrential rain just like that night, but in front of him, [Wu Lin] was covered in blood. He stared at [Li Jiang] intensely through the wet hair, struggling to prop himself up from the ground with one leg. [Li Jiang] walked towards [Wu Lin], gesturing for the bodyguard holding the umbrella to stay put, and then he threw away the cigar in his hand.
0:54:50|0:54:55|[Wu Lin] staggered to his feet, blood and saliva mixed at the corner of his mouth.
0:54:55|0:55:16|[Li Jiang] walked into the rain, staring at [Wu Lin] intently. [Wu Lin] also looked at him, his chest heaving violently in the flashing white light. Dark circles formed under [Li Jiang]'s eyes, making him look like a fierce jackal closing in on [Wu Lin]. [Wu Lin] raised his eyes to look at [Li Jiang], blood streaming down his forehead and left eye uncontrollably.
0:55:16|0:55:34|[Li Jiang] stared into [Wu Lin]'s eyes and suddenly became fierce. His fists smashed towards [Wu Lin]'s chest, causing him to fly backwards. With wide eyes, [Wu Lin] looked at [Li Jiang] in disbelief. The shock in [Li Feifei]'s eyes dispersed in an instant from her pupils.
0:55:36|0:56:1|[Wu Lin] fell backwards into the deep pit, with lightning illuminating [Li Jiang]'s face. He looked down at the pit without any emotion, while [Li Feifei] collapsed in despair. [Cold-blooded King Kong] held him tightly, as the man in black shoveled sand from the edge of the pit into it. [Li Jiang] slowly knelt beside the deep pit, watching as [Wu Lin] was covered by the sand. He couldn't bear to watch and tightly shut his eyes.
0:56:4|0:56:36|Sand covered [Wu Lin]'s body, making his appearance and clothing indistinguishable. [Li Jiang] looked down at the pit again, where clay was smearing over [Wu Lin]'s face. The rain poured down on his sandy body, washing away his consciousness. In the cold city, the financial center that shone like a star in the night sky was also being washed by the storm. Dark clouds, accompanied by fierce winds and rain, suddenly flashed with lightning. Several white lights flashed from somewhere in the dark night.
0:56:38|0:56:51|The lightning flashed across the dark night and splashed into the thick black clouds. The fierce tiger in the iron cage suddenly looked towards the window, while [Fomian] sitting on the throne in the hall still leaned on the dragon-headed cane.
0:56:54|0:57:10|The rain poured down outside, making the tiger in the cage restless. It paced and leaped around the cage as if its life was being threatened. [Fomian] calmly smoked a cigarette, as if he had everything under control.
0:57:10|0:57:20|[Wu Lin] seemed to be immersed in a clear pool of water, with wisps of smoke rising from the brim of [Fomian]'s hat.
0:57:25|0:57:50|In the blink of an eye, [Fomian] had already stood up sideways, tilting his head back to exhale smoke. Leaning on his cane, he walked to the side of the iron cage, with a tiger rising to follow his steps. [Wu Lin], soaked in water, blew a bubble, and the rain-soaked ground suddenly loosened. [Fomian] paced back and forth beside the iron cage, while the tiger inside sat down, opening its mouth to exhale a gust of wind.
0:57:51|0:58:1|[Wu Lin] swayed his head in the water, like a fierce tiger in a cage, suddenly widening his eyes as if sensing a life undergoing transformation and rebirth.
0:58:2|0:58:30|[Wu Lin] opened his eyes in the water, a thunderbolt struck down, an iron shoe kicked through the layers of soil and emerged from the ground, a tiger in the iron cage was shot and fell to the ground, [Fomian] slowly put down the gun in his hand, the sky seemed to be torn apart, thunder rolled, lightning surged, a hand reached out from the mud pit and tightly grasped the ground, the rain did not stop, [Wu Lin] climbed up the ground along the edge of the pit.
0:58:30|0:58:44|His whole body was wrapped in black mud, with only half of his mouth and his bared white teeth visible. [Wu Lin] supported his body with his arms, one leg propped on the edge of the pit, while the other leg was also lifted out of the pit.
0:58:45|0:59:10|[Wu Lin] crawled slowly out of the pit like a molting giant lizard, with the heavy shackles still hanging on his feet. [Wu Lin] half-knelt with one foot on the ground, his left hand resting on his knee, clenched his fist secretly. He pushed the ground with his right hand, but couldn't stand up. Fortunately, he used it to support the ground, allowing his right leg to also step flat on the ground.
0:59:10|0:59:34|[Wu Lin] was being pelted by the rain, with large and small chunks of mud falling off his body. His leather coat, which he always wore, was now soaked in mud, losing its original luster. His cheeks were also covered in black mud, resembling a motionless statue. He raised both hands high, looking up and shouting.
0:59:54|1:0:25|In a torrential rainstorm with lightning and thunder, [Wu Lin] clenches his fist and raises it in the air. A bolt of lightning splits the sky, illuminating the night as bright as day. With wet hair and blood at the corner of his mouth, [Wu Lin] searches through [Li Jiashan]'s desk. He picks up a certificate, flips through it, then puts it back. He finds a transparent disc in a case, which contains a video recording.
1:1:3|1:1:33|[Wu Lin] saw countless faces flash before his eyes. He clenched his teeth, closed his eyes tightly, and hammered the iron shoes on the ground. A crack appeared at the shoe's vamp. [Wu Lin] put down the hammer and painfully pried open the iron piece on the shoe. His foot was tightly wrapped with strips of cloth, and the whole foot was soaked black with mud. [Wu Lin] grabbed his ankle, and with great effort, pulled his toe out from the layers of cloth strips, as if blood was about to ooze out from his toes.
1:1:33|1:1:57|In the sink, a row of short hair fell down, [Wu Lin] cut off the hair behind the neck by himself, [Li Jiang] opened the box in front of him and found a pair of iron gloves inside. After cleaning the iron shoes in the room, they were placed on the table against the wall in the entrance. Suddenly, the iron shoes crushed the tabletop.
1:2:1|1:2:19|The river surged and the sky changed, the rising sun burst out from the rolling clouds, shining brightly on the entire city, making everything glow. Suddenly, the Golden Gate of the bodyguard group rang with a series of door-kicking sounds, the inside of the door was dark, empty, with no one in sight.
1:2:27|1:2:40|Two King Kong gates collapsed one after another, raising a cloud of dust. [Wu Lin] clenched his fists and walked in. He looked sharp and capable after cutting his short hair, and the polarized sunglasses covered his brows and eyes, making him appear steady and ruthless.
1:2:40|1:3:5|[Wu Lin] strode into the corridor, stepping on the floorboards with big strides. He was dressed in a high-quality suit and wore a pair of pointed leather shoes. [Wu Lin] walked expressionlessly towards the end of the corridor where the wall with a tiger head emblem was shining brightly, seemingly giving a silent warning. He turned into the security checkpoint at the entrance without hesitation and walked under the laser array. [Wu Lin] paused for a long time in place, but this time the alarm did not sound.
1:3:6|1:3:35|The warning lights above the laser array silently flickered, [Wu Lin] walked along the safety line towards the training ground, his figure disappearing into the darkness. After entering the training ground, [Wu Lin] stood still, and suddenly the overhead lights came on. He slowly took off his sunglasses, the light source above his head hiding his face in the shadows. He tucked the sunglasses into his shirt pocket and stared straight ahead as the lights in the training ground lit up one by one.
1:3:35|1:3:57|In the darkness, the hidden bodyguards revealed themselves, fully armed and lined up neatly in the open space. Most of them held sticks, while only the bodyguards in the front three rows were bare-handed. [Wu Lin] stood solemnly in front of this group, facing them quietly. Suddenly, the bodyguards launched into action and rushed towards him.
1:4:0|1:4:29|[Wu Lin] bent forward and charged a few steps, facing over a hundred burly bodyguards who were now ferocious and crazily rushing towards [Wu Lin]. With a single leg jump, [Wu Lin] spun in the air and kicked the bodyguard in the middle of the front row, sending him flying 10 meters away with tremendous force. [Wu Lin] then grabbed another person by the neck, executed a beautiful spinning kick in mid-air, hitting the person squarely in the face, and landed steadily.
1:4:29|1:4:42|Watching the bodyguards tightly surrounding him, a short figure immediately fell down with a sweeping leg in front of him. [Wu Lin] kicked two people in a row, attracting a group of knife-wielding bodyguards who stabbed and attacked him.
1:4:42|1:5:7|[Wu Lin] stood up and grabbed the hand of one person holding a knife, using his back to press down on the person and jump into the air. After landing, [Wu Lin] quickly got up and kicked away the iron rods in the hands of several people. He kicked and swept, continuously knocking down the approaching bodyguards. Suddenly, a bodyguard with an iron rod rushed forward and hit [Wu Lin] solidly on the back of his head.
1:5:7|1:5:18|A dozen iron rods smashed down towards him, he blocked with his elbow, his feet hanging in the air, one after another, his whirlwind kicks sweeping around, a flying kick knocking down a circle of people.
1:5:19|1:5:28|[Wu Lin] continues to exert force, knocking down one person with each kick, attempting to approach his bodyguards, the first wave of people all fall down, the second layer of encirclement quickly closes in.
1:5:28|1:5:54|[Wu Lin], with sharp eyes like a knife, kicked and sent flying the young man who led the charge. He used both legs to push away the two people in front of him, then performed a somersault to kick down the two people behind him. [Wu Lin] kicked another person's chin, sending him soaring into the air, spinning several times before crashing heavily to the ground. Two bodyguards swung their clubs towards him, [Wu Lin] stepped on one person's chest, flipped in mid-air, then kicked another person squarely in the face.
1:5:54|1:6:15|In the third wave of bodyguards surrounding them, [Wu Lin] seemed to activate instant movement and stepped on one person's leg with an arrow-like step. [Wu Lin] swiftly stepped on each person's calf or foot within the encirclement, causing the bodyguards who were hit to kneel down one after another. The last person took a fierce kick and flew out directly, smashing through the brick wall of the training ground.
1:6:15|1:6:25|[Wu Lin] landed a heavy punch, looking around at the surrounding bodyguards with a fierce gaze. The bodyguards, having witnessed his power, were quite wary and retreated closely from each other.
1:6:25|1:6:49|A row of people quickly rushed out with riot shields, forming a circle and binding [Wu Lin] in the middle. [Wu Lin] assumed a defensive stance, his eyes suddenly fierce. He kicked one of the guys along with the shield, sending him flying several meters away. The riot shield circle tightened immediately. As [Wu Lin] raised his hand to block, two people with knives charged towards him, stabbing directly at his abdomen.
1:6:49|1:7:11|[Wu Lin] grabbed the hand holding the knife and twisted it outward, causing both of them to fall heavily to the ground. [Wu Lin] then executed a flying kick, stepping on the closely arranged riot shields around him, breaking up half of the encirclement. A row of riot shields rushed towards him, but [Wu Lin] used the same trick again, only to be hit by an iron shield in the attack and defense, sending him flying. He quickly got up and tried to escape backwards, unexpectedly jumping into the combat arena enclosed by iron chains.
1:7:11|1:7:20|A person rushed in through the open iron gate, only to be kicked back by [Wu Lin], retracing his steps as several people climbed in over the fence on iron chains.
1:7:20|1:7:50|[Wu Lin] turned his head and exerted force repeatedly, his legs landing on their necks, waists, and chests, causing the incoming people to fall down one by one. At this moment, the riot shield team also rushed into the arena. [Wu Lin] stepped on the railing, suspended in the air and kicked down towards the back of a person's neck. As soon as he landed, he delivered a side kick, kicking the bodyguard who rushed in through the iron gate out of the arena. [Wu Lin] continued to exert force, kicking a young man's face as he swung a bat towards him. Nearly 10 bodyguards holding riot shields and iron rods rushed towards him.
1:7:50|1:8:14|[Wu Lin] turned around and kicked a riot shield, bending it, rendering five or six iron shields useless in an instant. The bodyguards, who had their protection removed, spat blood and fell to the ground one by one. [Wu Lin] leaped into the air, legs together, and delivered a spinning kick. The three people hit by the kick were pushed back as if by a shockwave, crashing through the fence of the fighting arena. [Wu Lin] was fighting with extreme excitement, already in a state of frenzy.
1:8:14|1:8:41|With an evil grin on his face, feeling the joy of battle, he suddenly turned around to look at the bodyguards behind him. [Wu Lin] shouted loudly, as if sounding the charge, and those people rushed towards him as if fighting to the death. [Wu Lin] let out a roar, like a tiger showing its might, causing the base of the mountain to kick up a bent explosion-proof shield spinning into the air. Beads of sweat dripped from [Wu Lin]'s temples as he slowly raised his head.
1:8:41|1:9:5|Lying around him were the constantly wailing bodyguards, crisscrossing and covering the ground of the arena. [Wu Lin] half-knelt among these people, calmly stood up and walked off the arena. Under the three steps outside the arena, bodyguards were still rolling in pain. [Wu Lin] stood under the steps for a few seconds, took big strides and left the training ground.
1:9:5|1:9:11|The field that was just occupied by a hundred bodyguards is now filled with the wounded and dying remnants.
1:9:12|1:9:35|In front of the Tiger Head Mechanical Gate stood a bodyguard holding a samurai sword. He was tall and had thick eyebrows and big eyes. He was none other than Jade-faced King Kong among the Eight King Kongs. In no time, Wu Lin unlocked the mechanical door lock with his fingers. Jade-faced King Kong was already unconscious and covered in blood. Wu Lin walked into the room, and the mechanical door closed automatically behind him.
1:9:37|1:10:6|He took a few steps forward, facing Cold-blooded King Kong sitting on the coffee table in front of him, with Fu Tou sitting next to the desk on her left. The heavy footsteps behind him were also heard, with Giant King Kong clenching his fists tightly, staring at [Wu Lin]. The cold-blooded female King Kong took the initiative to attack, but was kicked to the wall by [Wu Lin], spitting out a mouthful of blood on the ground. Fu Tou and Giant King Kong beside them gritted their teeth, with Giant King Kong roaring and smashing a fist towards [Wu Lin].
1:10:6|1:10:9|He was hit back by punches and kicks on his fists and knees.
1:10:9|1:10:36|Following, [Wu Lin] grabbed the hair on the forehead of [Giant King Kong], inserting two fingers below his throat. With a quick glance to the right, [Fu Tou] flew up with a kick, hitting the iron display screen on the table. After dodging a few moves, [Wu Lin] raised both hands to catch the next blade, also kicking [Fu Tou] out. [Fu Tou] unwillingly propped himself up, climbing up from the ground, with blood constantly dripping from the corner of his mouth.
1:10:36|1:10:42|[Fu Tou] flew towards [Wu Lin], but got caught on [Wu Lin]'s raised leg.
1:10:42|1:11:13|[Wu Lin] once again acted ruthlessly, [Fu Tou] was thrown onto the wooden stake for training. [Wu Lin] walked up to the fallen [Fu Tou], squatted down and looked into his eyes for a while. Suddenly, [Wu Lin]'s eyes lit up, and he arrived at an ancient iron gate. The gate opened automatically to the sides, and as [Wu Lin] entered, it closed slowly behind him. [Wu Lin] suddenly stopped, and [Li Feifei] and [Li Jiang] were locked in an iron cage.
1:11:27|1:11:34|[Fomian] frowned, leaning on his dragon-headed cane as he stood up and walked from the shadows to a place with side light.
1:11:37|1:11:45|[Fomian] twitched his eyebrows, and [Wu Lin] pulled up the sleeve of his left hand.
1:11:56|1:12:3|[Li Jiang] looked at [Wu Lin] and remembered the past. He comforted his wife by kissing the back of her hand in the car.
1:12:55|1:13:13|[Li Jiang] and [Fomian] hurriedly ran to the back mountain forest, where young [Wu Lin] was standing in front of [Li Feifei], facing off against a vicious wolf. [Fomian] looked on in horror as the wolf glanced at [Wu Lin], who stared back with a determined yet innocent gaze. The wolf began to retreat under his unwavering stare.
1:13:58|1:14:16|At the edge of the cliff, [Fomian] released his hands holding [Wu Lin] high, and [Wu Lin] instantly fell into the abyss. Now, as [Fomian] sees [Wu Lin], he chuckles sinisterly.
1:14:33|1:14:40|[Fomian] laughed heartily as he sat back on the dragon throne.
1:15:7|1:15:18|[Wu Lin] had sweat dripping down his face as [Bamian Shaxing] aimed a gun at him. [Wu Lin] stared fearlessly at the barrel.
1:15:20|1:15:25|Bamian Shaxing pulled the trigger, but was blocked by Li Jiang's iron fist. Li Jiang let go of his hand.
1:16:8|1:16:39|[Li Jiang] raised his right fist, but it was a left punch aimed straight at [Wu Lin]'s face. After taking a punch to the abdomen from [Li Jiang], [Wu Lin] slid back and quickly kicked back at [Li Jiang], using an iron fist to support the ground and stand firm. [Wu Lin] immediately rushed forward, unleashing a spiral kick that kicked [Li Jiang] to the wall. Then, lifting his foot, he unexpectedly kicked off the armrest of a nearby iron chair. [Li Jiang] threw a punch, but [Wu Lin] dodged it, smashing through the tabletop of the iron tea table and then lifting it to swing at [Wu Lin].
1:16:39|1:16:51|When [Wu Lin] was immediately kicked into pieces, [Wu Lin] made a sliding move, wrapping his legs around [Li Jiang]'s leg, [Li Jiang] flipped over and grabbed [Wu Lin]'s foot, hurling him into the air and slamming him heavily onto the iron floor.
1:16:51|1:17:2|[Wu Lin] glanced back at [Li Jiang], then wrapped his legs around his waist, spun and threw him off, followed by a swift spinning kick with one hand on the ground, kicking [Li Jiang] to the wall.
1:17:4|1:17:19|[Li Jiang] stood up with his hands pounding the ground, then pulled back in place and aimed at [Wu Lin]. A sly smile appeared on the aged face of [Fomian]. [Li Jiang] delivered a heavy blow, smashing a iron stake towards [Wu Lin], followed by a right hook hitting his cheek.
1:17:19|1:17:31|[Wu Lin] didn't suffer at all, a spinning kick knocked [Li Jiang] unconscious, then a fierce stomp accidentally broke through a brick wall. [Li Jiang] tried all his moves to strike at [Wu Lin], but ended up hitting the wall behind him.
1:17:31|1:17:56|[Wu Lin] kicked [Li Jiang] away, both of them spitting blood, fighting fiercely. [Li Jiang] countered by grabbing [Wu Lin]'s left arm and forcefully pushing him into a hole in the wall. [Wu Lin] hooked [Li Jiang]'s leg with his foot, jumped back, and slammed him onto the iron floor. Rolling to the side, [Wu Lin] then kicked [Li Jiang] in the abdomen, causing him to scream in pain and collapse. His feet relentlessly landed on [Li Jiang]'s elbow and shoulder.

1:18:26|1:19:2|[Wu Lin]'s eyes revealed a hint of pity, [Li Jiang] buried his head in tears, years of grievances and unwillingness finally erupted, [Fomian] sat indifferently on the golden chair, [Bamian Shaxing] hit [Li Jiang]'s chest, [Wu Lin] quickly grabbed [Li Jiang]'s arm to steady his body, [Wu Lin] glared angrily at [Fomian], blood streaming from [Li Jiang]'s mouth, he looked at [Wu Lin] indignantly and said
1:19:11|1:19:41|[Wu Lin] silently grasped [Li Jiang]'s hand with the full set, he half-supported [Li Jiang] up, [Li Jiang] stared straight at [Fomian], no trace of emotion in [Fomian]'s eyes, [Li Jiang]'s eyes twitched, seemingly harboring endless resentment towards [Fomian], he suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood, [Wu Lin] endured the pain and laid him flat on the ground, then stood up, baring his teeth fiercely at [Fomian],
1:19:58|1:20:11|[Wu Lin] clenched his fist tightly, then suddenly turned towards [Bamian Shaxing]. The latter quickly raised his gun and shot a bullet through [Wu Lin]'s left chest, causing a stream of blood to spurt out from his back.

[Wu Lin] covered his left chest, stood up, and mockingly looked at [Fomian], with thick blood still lingering at the corner of his mouth.
