0:2:2|0:2:21|The story begins with a car slowly stopping in front of a residential area. A man takes out a lighter, ignites a document with a form, then inserts a USB drive into a laptop, copying several folders containing land acquisition fee names into the drive. The man clenches his fists nervously, his eyes fixed on the screen.
0:2:21|0:2:27|After finishing, the man immediately pulled out a USB drive, deleted the files on the computer, and nervously glanced at the clock hanging behind him.
0:2:28|0:2:41|Continuing, Xu Decai carefully placed the USB drive into a small metal box, put it into the suitcase. After completing all this, he stood up straight, looked at himself in the mirror of the liquor cabinet opposite, pursed his lips, and then walked out of the room.
0:2:41|0:2:56|A man takes the elevator down, and as he steps out of the elevator, the camera behind him slowly starts to turn, closely following his figure. He hurries through the crowd, gets into a car, and drives away. On the road, it seems like a large vehicle is closely following the car the man is driving.
0:2:57|0:3:17|The man turned left, with a large car closely following behind. As the man waited at the traffic lights, in the car behind him, a pair of hands gripping the steering wheel were tapping anxiously. The man furrowed his brow and gradually drove towards the highway. When he turned and approached the toll station, he saw police officers setting up a checkpoint ahead, stopping and inspecting vehicles.
0:3:52|0:4:2|The man anxiously looked at the road ahead, then turned around and put the luggage in the back seat. He opened the car door and sat in the passenger seat.
0:4:9|0:4:13|A [police officer] walked up in front of the car.
0:4:48|0:4:51|The driver, with a big smile on his face, finished talking to the police and continued driving on the road.
0:5:23|0:5:37|The man impatiently took off his sunglasses and glared at the driver. After a while, the driver turned around and found the man had already disappeared. The driver gave him a disdainful look and the car slowly drove into the countryside.
0:5:56|0:6:14|The driver tried to help the man with the suitcase, but was rebuked. The man got off the car to avoid the dog inside, and took the luggage. The driver twitched his ears, sweat dripping down his forehead. He turned and walked towards the counter.
0:6:17|0:6:43|A fierce and menacing middle-aged woman stood up. Cuihua dug her head and stared at the driver. The woman still stood by the side, not leaving. The woman rolled her eyes.
0:6:47|0:7:6|Before long, the woman slammed the beef noodles onto the table. She turned and walked away, while the driver glared fiercely at her retreating figure. At that moment, the man also entered the restaurant. He walked up to the counter and found the landlady sound asleep. Silently, the man opened the nearby fridge and took out a bottle of water.
0:7:6|0:7:21|Suddenly, he noticed the calendar hanging next to the freezer. He walked up to it and carefully checked the date, then furrowed his brow. The man immediately relaxed, put on his sunglasses, and looked out the window. At that moment, three young men wearing flip-flops arrived at the door.
0:7:29|0:7:44|As the young man spoke, another middle-aged man appeared behind him. Before the words had even finished, everyone in the shop looked up in fear. The driver was kicked down.
0:8:6|0:8:8|The landlady overturned the table in front of her.
0:8:53|0:9:2|The chair smashed into the man, who was then surrounded and beaten by the young men, with no chance to fight back. The middle-aged man's eyes showed a fierce light.
0:9:31|0:9:48|Middle-aged man turned and left with his younger brothers. The man covered his forehead and got up from the ground. Finally, the young man kicked the man again and took his suitcase, then put the suitcase into the trunk of the eldest brother's car. The group of people drove away.
0:10:30|0:10:41|The driver looked apologetically at Xu Decai, reaching out to brush off the debris from his hair. Xu Decai sat down on the grass, looking up at the sky.
0:10:59|0:11:6|The man glared at the driver discontentedly, the driver showed a embarrassed expression, then moved closer to the man.
0:11:55|0:12:12|The man didn't reply, just closed the car door heavily, and the two continued on their journey. Along the way, they remained silent, the man checked his phone messages and saw a lost and found post online about his suitcase. The man looked up thoughtfully, lost in memories.
0:12:31|0:12:34|The woman's hand rests on the man's shoulder.
0:12:43|0:12:47|The man remained silent in contemplation, while the woman poured water and gazed at him upside down.
0:13:28|0:13:36|[Xu Decai] looked absent-minded, stopped talking, just smiled slightly at the woman, then he stood up and prepared to leave.
0:13:37|0:13:41|The man's back as he walks away stops, but he doesn't turn around.
0:13:53|0:14:1|After speaking, Xu Decai opened the door and left, leaving Wang Xiaobing alone. Her eyes were wandering, as if thinking about something.
0:15:13|0:15:18|A man sprayed water onto the car windshield, then the car turned into a yard and stopped.
0:16:1|0:16:4|The man in front moved his chest muscles.
0:16:36|0:16:52|The scene shifts to an abandoned factory, where the lighting is dim and a group of people are playing mahjong. It's now the turn of a man in a vest with a large gold chain to draw a tile. He picks up the tile, then smiles with satisfaction. He slams the tile onto the table.
0:17:9|0:17:24|Beside him, the younger brother handed him a cigarette. The younger brother took out a giant lighter, almost burning the eyebrows of the big brother. At this moment, the driver and [Xu Decai] arrived at the warehouse.
0:18:26|0:18:29|The elder brother splashed a cup of tea on [Xu Decai]'s face.
0:20:25|0:20:35|Big Brother took a deep drag on his cigarette, looked thoughtfully at the driver, then glanced at the table. He picked up all the money on the table, causing the others at the table to show expressions of heartache.
0:21:12|0:21:15|In the courtyard, a man with sunglasses walks in.
0:21:43|0:21:51|The scene shifts, an old man riding a bicycle passes by, the bike slowly enters a small alley and stops in front of a house.
0:22:39|0:22:41|The driver stopped [Xu Decai] who was about to leave.
0:22:46|0:22:58|[Xu Decai] walked away in silence. Behind him, a woman was taking photos with her phone of the driver and the dog in the car. Inside the hospital.
0:23:24|0:23:29|The doctor impatiently looked to the other side, and his eyes lit up when he caught sight of [Xu Decai] in front of him.
0:23:49|0:24:0|[Xu Decai] brushed off the doctor, and when he saw the doctor being called away by a nurse, he quickly grabbed the driver and tried to leave. However, the driver held him back and led him to a room, where they looked through the glass at his daughter lying on the hospital bed.
0:24:0|0:24:8|The woman who was taking care of the child on the side saw the driver, was about to greet him, but then quickly held back, pointed to the sickbed, and got up to walk out.
0:24:10|0:24:34|The woman carefully closed the door and took out the money from her pocket. She looked at her daughter on the sickbed with a heartache.
0:25:10|0:25:18|After finishing the IV drip, a group of people entered the ward. The driver walked to the bedside and looked at his daughter lying on the bed.
0:26:23|0:26:44|The driver gently kissed his daughter's forehead. With a smile, he gave a thumbs-up to his daughter as she slowly pushed towards the door, then gently closed the door. The woman furrowed her brows slightly and gave the driver a faint smile through the glass. [Xu Decai] patted the driver's shoulder, and the two of them silently left.
0:26:44|0:26:53|In the hospital corridor, the clock on the wall shows that it is 4:01 in the afternoon. The scene shifts to a young man, who is munching on an apple and staring at the computer screen.
0:26:55|0:27:6|The woman on the screen glanced to the side.
0:27:24|0:27:27|The man looked anxiously at the screen, the woman had already gone offline.
0:27:31|0:27:51|The man took off his headphones in disappointment, but his attention was soon caught by the computer screen. A post on the website called for help to rescue a dog trapped in a car, with the accompanying picture showing the small truck driven by the driver Xu Decai. The scene shifted to a group of young people standing in the rain on bikes, with the man from earlier unable to catch up.
0:27:57|0:28:16|The man threw his bike aside and led the way with pliers, followed by the young men. He used the pliers to pry open the cage at the back of the car, and all the puppies jumped out. Some of the puppies fell heavily to the ground when they jumped down because the car was too high. The young men then put up a wooden board to help the puppies get off the car.
0:28:16|0:28:23|After a while, the driver and [Xu Decai] returned. The driver looked towards his car.
0:28:27|0:28:31|The young man who had just left came back to get his bicycle and immediately ran away when he saw the two of them.
0:28:45|0:29:6|The driver threw away the umbrella and chased after the young man, who rode his bike through the puddles on the ground. The driver stepped into a puddle, getting his whole body wet, with wet hair sticking to his forehead. He waded through the puddles on the ground time and time again, desperately running forward. The driver caught up with the young man as he rode to the steps.
0:29:36|0:29:54|The driver took off his shoe and smashed it towards the young man, who stood at the alley entrance, looking helplessly around. The driver showed a look of despair, when suddenly, a warning sound was heard. The truck was lifted up and slowly moved forward, while the traffic police officer put away the ticket and prepared to leave.
0:30:0|0:30:3|The driver ran up immediately when he saw the traffic police waving.
0:30:31|0:30:49|The traffic policeman rode away, leaving the driver staring blankly at his receding figure. Helplessly, the driver squatted in the corner as the rain continued to pour down, soaking him completely. His shirt clung tightly to his back. At that moment, [Xu Decai] approached him, holding an umbrella, and he opened it above the driver's head.
0:30:50|0:31:6|The driver slowly raised his head and looked at [Xu Decai]. [Xu Decai] silently took out a cigarette from his pocket, lightly tapped the driver's head, handed it to the driver. The driver then took it, shook off the water droplets on his hand, took out a cigarette and put it to his lips. He lit the cigarette, then raised his head and handed the cigarette box back to [Xu Decai].
0:32:1|0:32:8|The driver stood up, tears swirling in his eyes.
0:32:48|0:33:4|[Xu Decai] held an umbrella, watching the driver silently shedding tears. The driver couldn't hold back anymore, burying his head in his shirt, squatting down and crying bitterly. [Xu Decai] opened another umbrella in his hand, shielding the driver from the rain on the other side. By now, the driver's eyes were already red from crying.
0:33:4|0:33:23|He looked up, took the umbrella from [Xu Decai], and [Xu Decai] turned and walked slowly towards the alley. As he walked, he noticed that the driver was not following him, so he stopped and turned back to wait. The driver stood up, wiped his face, wiped away the rain and tears on his face, adjusted his emotions, and took a few steps forward.
0:33:23|0:33:28|Caught up with [Xu Decai], the two looked at each other, shoulder to shoulder, and left together.
0:33:30|0:33:38|The scene shifts, dusk falls, and the elderly start gathering in the square to do fitness exercises. [Xu Decai] and the driver walk through the crowd.
0:33:50|0:34:8|The driver stepped forward and pushed the man who was assaulting someone, but his girlfriend immediately defended the man. [Xu Decai] turned around immediately, pointing at the two with a fierce and intimidating look. The driver smirked at the couple, then turned around and continued walking forward.
0:34:25|0:34:28|A man is standing on the rooftop shouting through a megaphone.
0:34:43|0:34:45|The driver awkwardly turned around and glanced back.
0:35:47|0:36:7|[Xu Decai] patted the driver, who lowered his head and walked forward. Suddenly feeling something was wrong, he stopped and looked back at [Xu Decai]. [Xu Decai] gave him a look, then looked towards the rooftop. The driver, feeling helpless, continued to walk forward and reached the staircase.
0:37:45|0:37:53|The scene changes, [Xu Decai] sits on the edge of the bed with a towel draped over him, and there are sounds of things being dropped in the bathroom.
0:38:12|0:38:16|[Xu Decai] quickly grabbed the clothes and hung them up.
0:38:32|0:38:47|[Xu Decai] threw the towel to the driver. After a while, the driver covered his head with the towel, carefully opened the door, peeked at what [Xu Decai] was doing, then came out. He wiped his head slowly and cautiously lit up the room. When he saw the big bed in the room, he frowned and showed a troubled expression.
0:39:14|0:39:27|[Xu Decai] looked at the driver's cartoon underwear and slapped him. [Xu Decai] closed his eyes and silently touched his forehead.
0:39:48|0:39:54|The driver half sat up, knelt by the bed, stared at [Xu Decai], and then relentlessly lay back down on the bed.
0:40:6|0:40:19|[Xu Decai] angrily leaned back, pointing his foot at the driver. The driver also leaned back and soon started snoring. [Xu Decai] then placed his phone on his face, pretending to be charming.
0:40:19|0:40:29|He reached out to take the phone off his face, opened his eyes to look at the ceiling, glanced at the driver snoring beside him, and reached out to turn off the bedside lamp.
0:40:30|0:40:50|In the darkness, [Xu Decai] opened his eyes, with a thin layer of sweat on his forehead. He stared expressionlessly at the ceiling, seemingly lost in thought. In the early morning, the driver was fast asleep, when suddenly, the phone rang. [Xu Decai] sat up in bed, covering his head with a pillow, struggling to find the phone.
0:41:22|0:41:36|The scene changes, the elevator door opens, a beautiful woman in a tight skirt stands in the middle of the elevator, [Xu Decai] steps out of the elevator, sees the driver still staring at the woman up and down, pulls the driver away, the woman looks at the driver and rolls her eyes persistently.
0:45:42|0:45:47|There is a silver box in the trunk.
0:46:50|0:46:56|The two of them looked at the man in confusion.
0:49:15|0:49:19|The two of them quietly waited for the boxing match to finish before playing mahjong.
0:49:56|0:49:58|The front desk impatiently rolled their eyes.
0:51:24|0:51:30|The store clerk was puzzled, [Xu Decai] walked to the door and answered the phone.
0:52:47|0:53:0|An unfamiliar middle-aged man speaks. The driver bursts into the office. The driver reaches out to grab the box.
0:53:9|0:53:15|[Xu Decai] walked out of the office and found another small compartment next to it, filled with various equipment.
0:53:53|0:54:2|[Xu Decai] suddenly stopped in his tracks. The scene shifted to a woman browsing handbags in the store. Just then, a phone rang, and she picked up the call.
0:54:7|0:54:9|The driver wanted to approach, but [Xu Decai] waved his hand at him and kept his distance.
0:54:36|0:54:58|The woman seemed to have known it long ago. She had an indifferent expression. Her eyes glanced around, lips tightly closed, she pursed her lips. Strands of hair fell slightly in front of her forehead, covering her eyes, making it hard to tell what she was thinking.
0:55:0|0:55:17|The woman hung up the phone, showing a fierce expression, picked up her bag and walked out of the mall. The camera then cuts to a woman playing games on a tablet. [Xu Decai] tilts her head back and drinks a glass of white wine, then picks up her chopsticks to pick up food. The driver frowns at her, then looks helplessly outside the door.
0:55:21|0:55:24|[Xu Decai] is about to pour wine again, but the Driver Alliance snatches the bottle.
0:56:19|0:56:32|He finished his drink in one gulp, immediately wrinkling his brow in response to the stimulation. He looked outside the shop, searching for the figure of [Xu Decai]. The driver stood up and walked to the door.
0:56:35|0:56:42|[Xu Decai] was pushed down by a man, got into the car, while the driver stood at the door with his hands on his hips, watching as the car carrying [Xu Decai] drove away.
0:56:51|0:57:0|[Xu Decai] reached out to open the car door, but Ah Qiang signaled to his henchman sitting next to him. The henchman quickly pulled out an iron chain, attempting to strangle [Xu Decai].
0:57:0|0:57:19|[Xu Decai] reacted quickly, immediately grabbing a hold of the iron chain with one hand and seizing the driver's hair with the other. The car on the road kept braking suddenly, and seeing this, [Xu Decai] opened the car door to escape. However, Ah Qiang and his men also rushed out of the car and started beating up [Xu Decai]. The driver standing at the store entrance quickly ran over to help.
0:57:25|0:57:37|The driver took [Xu Decai] and fled, the two of them running desperately in the alley. Ah Qiang followed closely with a few people, running through the alley and onto the main street, where passersby stopped to watch.
0:57:47|0:57:59|Under the scorching sun, the two of them ran wildly, crossing the road, running across the pedestrian bridge. The people behind them still refused to give up, the driver panting heavily. They ran up the stairs, rushed through the ticket gate, and ran into the police station.
0:58:4|0:58:18|Xu Decai and Wang Xiaobing rushed into the zoo. The fast-moving figures passed by the camels grazing nearby. Ah Qiang and his men were also exhausted.
0:58:19|0:58:32|The two of them somersaulted past the giraffe enclosure. The giraffes turned their heads to look at the group. The sheep grazing nearby also lifted their heads in surprise. They passed through the crowd taking photos, with [Xu Decai] following closely behind.
0:58:37|0:58:59|The two turned a corner and ran into a black bear head-on. [Wang Xiaobing] quickly turned back and ran out of the park. The driver followed him, but accidentally hit his leg on the door frame. They ran to a pedestrian bridge. [Xu Decai] saw several people still running below.
0:58:59|0:59:5|The driver saw two voodoo dolls on the roadside, quickly picked one up and threw it at [Xu Decai], while holding the other one himself.
0:59:8|0:59:27|[Wang Xiaobing] watched two swaggering dolls passing by without any suspicion. The camera then cut to the dock, where the two men squatted silently under a pillar, both shirtless with only vests on their upper bodies. The driver stood up and squatted in front of [Xu Decai].
1:0:12|1:0:23|[Xu Decai] saw the money stuffed into his hand. The driver, upon hearing this, was shocked and looked into the distance with his hands on his hips.
1:0:35|1:1:1|The driver licked his lips, leaned against the road sign, smiled as he looked towards the water in the distance, with rows of tall buildings standing on the opposite bank. The scene shifted, the woman sat angrily on the sofa, frowning and deep in thought. On the other side, the woman rolled her eyes in anger, while [Xu Decai] looked pensive at the ground.
1:1:6|1:1:13|The woman walked towards the stalled car on the roadside with her bag. She opened the door and found [Xu Decai] sitting in the driver's seat.
1:1:15|1:1:30|The woman was startled and turned to leave. Unexpectedly, the driver pushed her back into the seat, and [Xu Decai] started the car and drove forward. The driver and Ah Qiang sat in the back seat, with Ah Qiang's hands and feet tied, his mouth taped shut, struggling to make muffled sounds.
1:1:39|1:1:46|The driver pushed Ah Qiang's head down, while the woman sat in the passenger seat, anxiously stealing glances at [Xu Decai] from the corner of her eye. Then.
1:2:8|1:2:31|[Wang Xiaobing] remained silent, looking at the glass on the table. She picked up the glass and drank it all in one gulp. [Xu Decai] lowered his head and looked at the table. After [Wang Xiaobing] finished drinking, she stood up, turned around to leave, but was grabbed by the wrist by [Xu Decai].
1:2:41|1:2:57|[Wang Xiaobing] shook off [Xu Decai]'s hand, [Xu Decai] looked at [Wang Xiaobing]'s departing figure with a desolate expression. Inside the restroom, [Wang Xiaobing] threw her bag aside and leaned weakly on the sink. Gasping heavily, [Wang Xiaobing] stared at her exhausted self, unable to stop retching.
1:2:57|1:3:9|[Wang Xiaobing] turned on the tap and splashed some water on his face, slowly calming down. [Wang Xiaobing] couldn't stand steadily, looking like he was about to faint. He kept splashing water on his face and then looked up at the mirror.
1:3:10|1:3:24|He brushed aside the stray hairs on his forehead, his face covered in droplets of water. Then, the woman looked at herself in the mirror, her eyes transitioning from confusion to determination. He returned to his seat, and at that moment, a waiter approached with two cocktails.
1:4:6|1:4:23|The two men saw that the waiter showed no intention of leaving, so they stood up, picked up the straws from the wine glasses, and each took a sip with empty eyes. [Xu Decai] furrowed his brow tightly, his face serious. The woman held her face in her hands, looking out the window with a troubled mind. Then, [Xu Decai] looked disappointedly at the woman.
1:5:9|1:5:14|[Xu Decai] raised his hand slightly, and the woman rolled her eyes disdainfully.
1:5:21|1:5:24|Zhao Bin turned his head and glared fiercely at [Xu Decai].
1:5:59|1:6:3|[Xu Decai] had tears in his eyes, he slowly closed his eyes, and tears streamed down his cheeks.
1:6:12|1:6:30|He stood up, picked up the red wine glass in front of him, raised it towards Zhao Bin, and then slowly poured the red wine into the porcelain plate next to him. Zhao Bin looked silently at [Xu Decai]. As the red wine splashed down, water droplets splattered and flew onto the table. [Xu Decai] glared fiercely at Zhao Bin, letting the wine splash around freely.
1:6:30|1:6:39|Zhao Bin looked at [Xu Decai] in astonishment, then glanced at the wine in the plate. [Xu Decai] slowly poured the wine into the plate, and the wine fell into it, splashing droplets around.
1:6:40|1:6:55|The two of them looked at each other in silence. Then, [Xu Decai] slammed down the wine glass in his hand, glared angrily at Zhao Bin, and decisively turned and walked away. Zhao Bin stared at his departing figure, [Xu Decai] walked faster and faster, and finally started to run.
1:6:58|1:7:6|[Xu Decai] rushed out of the coffee shop, startling the driver sitting at the door, who quickly stood up and looked around. Zhao Bin stood up and looked towards the door.
1:7:11|1:7:27|Dusk fell, the sun setting in the west. [Xu Decai] and the driver lay on the cement ground by the roadside, with several beer bottles scattered haphazardly between them. The driver looked at [Xu Decai], who gazed up at the sky.
1:8:36|1:8:54|Ziji frowned and looked at [Xu Decai], who remained silent and gazed up at the sky. At night, various scenes in the city, neon lights on buildings lit up one after another, the streets bustling with traffic at intersections and bridges, and the bustling lights on the main street.
1:8:54|1:9:4|The dim streetlights in the underground tunnel flickered as the car moved forward, with the lights passing one by one behind it, and the bustling traffic on the road surface was overwhelming.
1:9:6|1:9:26|The scene shifts, the old wall covered with moss, ants crawling around without restraint. Outside a glass house, flowers are displayed, a weathered wooden board with flower language written on it hangs above the door. A woman is watering the flowers next to her with a spray bottle, gently caressing each flower.
1:9:26|1:9:31|The gentle breeze brushed by, causing the wind chimes by the window to sway softly. She cautiously reached out and touched the scissors on the table.
1:9:33|1:9:43|The woman picked up the scissors and carefully trimmed the leaves of the flowers, looking out the window along the clusters of flowers on the table. A high school student came to the window.
1:10:30|1:10:49|On the other side, as the day was breaking, [Xu Decai] was still lying on the cement floor asleep, while his driver had already disappeared. [Xu Decai] groggily sat up, looked around, and found a small note placed beside his head. He unfolded the note, which was a message from the driver. It read:
1:10:53|1:11:2|[Xu Decai] quickly got up, picked up the phone next to him, and hurriedly called the driver. On the other side, the shirt was draped over the chair, and the phone rang.
1:11:8|1:11:11|Students come in and help take out their phones.
1:11:15|1:11:18|The woman took the phone, fumbling, and pressed the answer button.
1:11:47|1:12:0|[Xu Decai] leaned weakly against the railing. Nearby, a truck was parked in front of the flower shop. The driver got out and walked into the shop, lifting his vest to wipe the sweat off his face, while glancing towards the room inside.
1:12:25|1:12:44|The woman happily smiled when she heard the driver was willing to stay for dinner. She reached out to the plate of tomatoes on the side, picked one up and placed it on the cutting board, looking straight ahead as she cautiously sliced it. As the driver walked down the stairs, at that moment, [Xu Decai] burst in and threw a punch at the driver as soon as he saw him going up.
1:14:2|1:14:5|The driver stepped forward, grabbed [Xu Decai]'s collar, and pushed him against the wall.
1:14:35|1:14:42|Xu Decai slowly let go, releasing the driver's collar. The driver wiped away the tears from the corner of his eye and turned to look towards Yangshan.
1:14:53|1:15:10|The driver pushed [Xu Decai], who staggered towards the wall, his eyes filled with shock. Three people sat at the round table in the room, with Yang Shan holding a glass bottle in her right hand and a cup in her left hand, pouring a glass of wine for the driver and then for herself.
1:15:25|1:15:31|Yang Shan raised a glass to the driver, while [Xu Decai] silently watched the two of them. Yang Shan then poured another glass for [Xu Decai].
1:16:5|1:16:7|Yang Shan fumbled and picked up the chopsticks.
1:16:50|1:16:55|[Xu Decai] stared straight at Yangshan, while the driver kept silent with his eyes downcast.
1:17:3|1:17:18|The camera slowly moves up, passing by a pair of broken dance shoes hanging next to the dilapidated wooden staircase. [Xu Decai] can no longer hold back, his lips trembling, silently lowering his head as if he was about to burst into tears in the next second.
1:17:34|1:17:50|[Xu Decai] was in tears, crying uncontrollably. He trembled as he raised the female prisoner in front of him, desperately trying to force-feed her. His body shook uncontrollably, struggling to chew the food in his mouth, tears streaming down his face, filled with deep regret.
1:17:51|1:18:13|Xiangyang from the opposite side looked straight ahead with a smile on his face, but his eyes were already filled with tears. In the fish tank beside him, several fish were swimming leisurely. The three of them sat around a round table, with a few small dishes on the table, but no one made a move to eat. Outside the window, dusk was approaching, and the sky was misty.
1:18:13|1:18:17|At this moment, a man pushed aside the door curtain and walked in.
1:18:50|1:18:57|[Xu Decai] looked up, turned around and looked around. On the other side, the workers began to move the furniture out of the flower shop.
1:19:1|1:19:20|Several workers directed the forklift to slowly stop in front of the flower shop. [Xu Decai] walked towards the house and coincidentally met the driver coming out. The driver looked up at the roof and was startled.
1:19:36|1:19:39|[Ma Dongmei] stood on the rooftop, smiling and pointing towards the distance.
1:19:48|1:20:1|The workers downstairs heard the noise and gathered around, looking up at [Yang Shan] on the roof. As the music grew louder, [Yang Shan] gently swayed her body, her head also slightly nodding to the music.
1:20:2|1:20:23|His face was filled with a happy smile as he slowly raised his arms and danced gracefully to the music. A small flower was pinned behind his ear, and he wore a pair of small heeled leather shoes on his feet. As the movements unfolded slowly, his hands and legs trembled slightly involuntarily. Nevertheless, [Yang Shan] still danced confidently.
1:20:23|1:20:28|Surrounded by flowers, her graceful and elegant figure resembles a swan gliding on calm waters during the day.
1:20:30|1:20:36|The workers gathered downstairs were all attracted, staring intently at the materials on the roof.
1:20:36|1:20:52|In the dilapidated tin roof surroundings, [Xu Decai] with a determined look, his initial movements seem like bending down, yet also like looking up, like coming and going, so calm and unhurried, yet so full of melancholy, it is difficult to describe in words.
1:20:54|1:21:3|He kept jumping, seemingly without any intention of stopping, his dance moves resembling flying, walking, standing, and leaning at the same time.
1:21:3|1:21:17|The casual movements are never lacking in strength, the floral pleated skirt on [Xu Decai] sways in the wind, slender arms coordinate with hand movements weaving in and out, a continuous flow of dancing postures scattered, twisting body movements with hands and feet together.
1:21:19|1:21:37|[Xu Decai] also stood in the crowd, smiling as he looked at Yangshan. Yangshan danced, spinning happily under the flower arch. As the music ended, Yangshan struck a final pose. He opened his arms, looked up at the sky, and the workers spontaneously burst into applause.
1:21:37|1:21:42|[Xu Decai] shielded the sun with his hand, smiled at Yangshan, and then turned to look at the workers beside him.
1:21:44|1:21:58|The workers behind immediately turned around, turned off the radio in the car, and [Xu Decai] looked thoughtfully at the rooftop. At this moment, the driver brought Yang Shan down from the roof.
1:22:1|1:22:22|Workers were about to move things forward when they were stopped by [Xu Decai]. Yang Shan stood at the entrance of the flower shop, slowly stroking the door curtain and touching the flowers hanging beside the door. [Xu Decai] stared at Yang Shan intently, while Yang Shan showed a reluctant expression. With red eyes, Yang Shan silently walked towards the building.
1:22:22|1:22:27|The driver greeted the workers, who then proceeded to the demolition work one after another.
1:22:28|1:22:46|One by one, people passed by [Xu Decai], who was standing in front of a building about to be demolished. Behind him, a giant poster slowly unfolded, showing a determined half-body portrait of [Xu Decai] with his arms crossed in front of his chest, looking down with a piercing gaze as the wind blew.
1:22:46|1:23:3|Above him, there were several big characters shining brightly, saying "Follow the law of the jungle, versatile and worry-free". [Xu Decai] looked up, chuckled self-deprecatingly, and walked away. The workers swung their hammers, tore off the already dilapidated window frames, and the excavator pushed the small shed on the roof.
1:23:4|1:23:18|Broken glass and wood debris scattered on the ground, looking inside the doorway, the furniture has been removed, leaving only empty rooms. The rooms are decorated with floral wallpaper, and each door frame is adorned with carefully crafted door curtains.
1:23:18|1:23:33|The wooden staircase on the side seems to have been repainted, spotless, with only a small flower-shaped hook left on it, while the dance shoes that were originally hanging on it are nowhere to be seen. The scene shifts, the driver waits by the roadside in the truck, and [Xu Decai] opens the door and gets in.
1:23:50|1:24:5|[Xu Decai] nodded towards the front, and the driver slowly drove forward. At that moment, a message came on the phone, and [Xu Decai] opened it to play the voice message.
1:24:22|1:24:27|[Xu Decai] put down his phone, looked up and let out a long sigh, leaning weakly against the back of the seat.
1:24:59|1:25:17|The driver Zhongmei looked at [Xu Decai], seeing his determined gaze and resolute expression, she silently started the car and drove forward. The two drove out of the village, through the city center, over the bridge, onto the highway. Along the way, [Xu Decai] remained silent, lips tightly closed, staring straight ahead.
1:25:17|1:25:24|The driver had a worried look on his face, occasionally looking at [Xu Decai] with concern, while [Xu Decai] had a lifeless expression and squinted eyes.
1:25:26|1:25:47|He closed his eyes and looked out the window, silently organizing his thoughts. Outside the window, the autumn air was crisp, and the leaves had already taken on the appearance of fall. Traffic flowed continuously on the highway, and in the distance, a plane was taking off. In the driver's seat, a small flower decoration in front of the co-pilot seat swayed gently.
1:25:47|1:25:51|As dusk fell, the driver and [Xu Decai] gradually drove towards the airport.
1:26:25|1:26:30|The driver looked at [Xu Decai], who raised his eyebrows at the driver and then decisively turned and walked away.
1:26:31|1:26:49|The driver looked at the reflection of Xu Decai's back in the rearview mirror, as if he was about to cry, until Xu Decai's figure gradually disappeared and was no longer visible. The driver pursed his lips, turned around, looked into the distance in a daze, then lowered his head, started the car, and drove away.
1:26:49|1:26:59|Next, [Xu Decai] stood by the highway, took out two cigarettes and lit them. He took one cigarette from his mouth, faced towards the sky, raised the cigarettes with both hands, and bowed.
1:27:3|1:27:18|[Xu Decai] looked solemnly into the distance, then placed the cigarette on the roadside guardrail. He stared at the cigarette thoughtfully for a while, glanced at the sky, as if making a firm decision, then turned and walked away, leaving the cigarette to burn alone.
1:27:21|1:27:33|The tailwind blows, the cigarette burns slowly, the ash falls, the smoke rises in wisps, two lonely cigarettes lean on each other, burning together, heading towards the end of life.
1:28:3|1:28:22|The landlady finished calling for people and sat down again. The driver glanced at the kitchen, sighed, and sat at the first round table. Cuihua still impatiently dropped a bowl of beef noodles and left with her fingers curled. The driver, however, didn't show much temper, just silently stared at the door in front of him.
1:28:22|1:28:26|At this moment, the few men who had fought with them before have returned to the restaurant.
1:29:13|1:29:16|A henchman quickly brought the box over and handed it to the driver.
1:29:33|1:29:38|The driver quickly put the boxes into the car and prepared to leave.
1:29:58|1:30:6|The leading man waved his hand towards the driver and sighed. The driver drove while anxiously making a phone call.
1:30:10|1:30:29|Seeing that [Xu Decai]'s phone was unreachable, the driver anxiously changed lanes and stepped on the gas pedal, driving forward aggressively. The exhaust pipe of the small truck emitted thick smoke, speeding up on the highway, overtaking car after car. The license plate of the truck was already worn out, with signs of wear around the front of the vehicle.
1:30:29|1:30:35|The driver, anxious as ever, had long since disregarded everything else and only wanted to catch up with [Xu Decai] as quickly as possible.
1:30:37|1:30:59|The truck raced forward recklessly, the driver stopped where he had just dropped off [Xu Decai], got out of the car and ran to the roadside, anxiously looking around. At this moment, no one responded to the driver's words, he hesitated and looked towards the airport, then turned around to search behind him.
1:31:4|1:31:25|The driver stood on the side of the road, helplessly looking around. He supported his waist with one hand, sweat soaking through his vest. Looking down, he saw the two cigarettes left by [Xu Decai] just now. He reached out, pinched them, but the cigarettes had already burned out. At this moment, the phone rang, and the driver took out his phone from his pocket, leaning against the side of the road to answer.
1:32:25|1:32:38|Upon hearing Xu Decai's words, Wang Xiaobing's body trembled slightly. He turned his head to the side, his eyes turning red, as if about to smoke. Looking around, his lips tightened, he took a step towards the truck and continued on the journey.
1:32:45|1:33:6|The truck was driving on the highway, with [Xu Decai] at the wheel, his face filled with sorrow and melancholy. He took a deep breath, trying to adjust his emotions, but it seemed ineffective. Letting out a long sigh, he lowered his head to shift gears, slowly pulling the car over to the side of the road. He took out a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and placed it in his mouth.
1:33:6|1:33:9|He took a deep drag, and his shoulders slowly sank.
1:33:26|1:33:42|[Driver] He closed his eyes and then opened them, looking ahead with a lost expression. It seemed like he remembered something, and his calm demeanor was slowly stirred up again. His eyes gradually turned red, and at this moment, he could no longer hold back his tears, which streamed down his face.
1:33:42|1:33:51|His hand holding the cigarette is against his forehead, while the other hand covers his mouth and nose. Tears stream down his face as he bites his hand in agony, trying to stifle his sobs.
1:33:54|1:34:1|The camera cuts to [Xu Decai]'s truck continuing on the road, driving towards the distance.
