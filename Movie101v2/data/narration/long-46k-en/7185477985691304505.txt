0:2:1|0:2:11|Xiaoyou placed the treasure map on the table, catching the attention of two individuals. [Hu Zi] quickly took out his phone and started filming together.
0:2:15|0:2:24|Yang Jiacheng has a complex terrain. In the past five years, many masters in the circle have tried to challenge him, but all ended in failure.
0:2:29|0:2:38|[Heizi] gave a glance and the cold bodyguard beside him immediately took out a safe and placed it in front of [Alliance Leader].
0:2:45|0:2:56|[Hu Zi] unexpectedly found a photo of [Alliance Leader]'s wife and son in the pile of money. As [Alliance Leader] looked at the photo, his heart couldn't help but tighten.
0:3:33|0:3:51|Handed over to [Hu Zi], the situation became tense. [Alliance Leader] quickly put the jade pendant and treasure map into the bag, then led [Hu Zi] away. [Miao Zi], who had been waiting outside for a long time, finally saw the appearance of [Alliance Leader] and [Hu Zi], and hurriedly followed their footsteps.
0:4:36|0:4:51|It's worth pondering for [Miao Zi] whether the escape route is real or fake. The [Alliance Leader] immediately took off [Miao Zi]'s glasses and threw them on the ground, exuding a threatening demeanor. With a kick towards the glasses, the [Alliance Leader] completely shattered [Miao Zi]'s loyalty to him.
0:4:54|0:5:5|[Alliance Leader] The two brothers left gracefully, leaving [Miao Zi] to plan a new path for himself. A perfect opportunity arose as [Hu Zi] casually handed the bag containing the treasure map to [Miao Zi].
0:5:5|0:5:16|[Miao Zi] took out the treasure map and the jade pendant, put them in his pocket, and then casually got on the car. Inside the car, [Miao Zi] suddenly slammed on the brakes, venting his dissatisfaction towards the brothers [Alliance Leader] and [Donggua].
0:5:18|0:5:35|It is obvious that [Miao Zi] did it on purpose. The [Alliance Leader] kicked [Miao Zi] off the car, then started the car and left, leaving [Miao Zi] behind at the camp. Watching the tense atmosphere around the [Alliance Leader] here, it can be said to be full of relaxation.
0:5:38|0:5:48|A person riding a spirited horse gallops passionately on the racetrack. The horse gradually slows down its racing pace, bringing [Alliance Leader] and the others back to the real-life troubles.
0:5:50|0:6:12|The loss of the treasure map troubled their Daoist beliefs. [Hu Zi] dialed [Miao Zi]'s number again, but the unanswered prompt made him frown, cursing under his breath. The same happened when [Alliance Leader] dialed.
0:6:19|0:6:31|It is obvious that [Miao Zi] has seen through the deception of the [Alliance Leader] and chooses to leave. The [Alliance Leader] couldn't help but feel uneasy in his heart.
0:6:36|0:6:42|[Miao Zi] Various abnormal signs pointed to him as the prime suspect for the missing treasure map.
0:6:50|0:7:10|Wu Zi's first suspect was [Miao Zi]. By the poolside with melodious music playing, a slender and graceful beauty emerged from the water and walked towards the shore.
0:7:12|0:7:30|Every step Xaio Xiaotian took seemed to tread on Sha Sha's heart, as he had already fixed his gaze on her by the shore. Xiao Xiaotian watched every step Sha Sha took with a look of infatuation, finding every expression on her face to be picturesque.
0:7:30|0:7:36|Seeing Xianxian walk ashore, he quickly approached and struck up a conversation with her in Taiwanese.
0:7:49|0:7:53|Xianxian intentionally looked at [Xiao Xiaotian] with deep affection in her eyes.
0:7:59|0:8:3|On the shore, two people gazed into the distance under an umbrella, with a hint of romance and warmth.
0:8:6|0:8:31|A luxury car stopped at the entrance of the Wuzhou International Hotel, and a man and a woman got out of the car. Judging by their demeanor, the man seemed quite formidable. The man's name is [Zhang Renfa]. [Xiao Xiaotian] personally came downstairs to greet them, further highlighting the man's extraordinary status. The group then walked up the stairs, ready to discuss a mysterious deal.
0:8:35|0:8:43|[Xiao Xiaotian] and the others had just walked up the stairs when the Mengchu brothers entered the hotel right after them.
0:8:53|0:8:59|With a few knocks on the door, a burly man walked into the room, bringing [Xiao Xiaotian] some good news.
0:9:4|0:9:9|[Xiao Xiaotian] took out the safe and deliberately opened it in front of everyone.
0:9:13|0:9:16|[Zhang Renfa] stared at the box of money, lost in thought.
0:9:40|0:9:48|Obviously, [Zhang Renfa] has been fooled by [Xiao Xiaotian]'s actions and decides to buy the vase immediately.
0:10:4|0:10:8|Brother Fa carefully held the vase in his hands as if it were a treasure.
0:10:14|0:10:22|Completely forgetting about his lover beside him, [Xiao Qian]. Wu Dalang, carrying sixty thousand, returned to the room once again. [Xiao Xiaotian] warmly welcomed him to take a seat.
0:10:35|0:10:55|Wu, full of expectations, helped [Xiao Xiaotian] negotiate such a big deal. However, the empty-handed [Xiao Xiaotian] only gave him a hundred yuan as a reward. Xianxian curiously opened the safe, wanting to feast her eyes on the huge sum of money. Unexpectedly, as she rummaged through it, she discovered a huge secret.
0:11:38|0:11:52|[Alliance Leader] looked at the photos secretly taken by [Hu Zi] and roughly located the position of the treasure sword. [Alliance Leader] was worried about the lack of a hidden location.
0:12:11|0:12:27|At a critical moment, [Hu Zi] unexpectedly had a sudden inspiration and shouted [Miao Zi]'s name. After a passionate exchange between the two, [Miao Zi] revealed lazily to Qianqian the treasure she had stolen.
0:12:30|0:12:34|Qianqian tied up this jade-skinned cultivator, her face showing complete indifference.
0:12:47|0:12:49|At the mention of antiques, Sha Sha became interested.
0:13:0|0:13:2|Yaozi is already envisioning the life before and after winning.
0:13:13|0:13:15|Qianqian knew well that her identity was awkward.
0:14:20|0:14:26|The next morning, Yao went to the main street to post small advertisements. The ads prominently displayed the words "Sincere plea for help."
0:14:28|0:14:39|Before long, the street was filled with advertising slogans. [Miao Zi] was still not satisfied and continued on. The arrival of a police car at the corner interrupted [Miao Zi]'s progress.
0:14:46|0:15:10|In the police car, Min is telling the vendor about patrol precautions, mentioning thirst, and then handing him a bottle of drink. While drinking, Min's attention is drawn to an advertisement on the utility pole. The vendor follows her gaze, then opens the car door and walks over, leaning against the pole to carefully observe the content of the advertisement.
0:15:24|0:15:35|In front of the remote cave, [Hu Zi] cried falsely, and was slapped into the cave by the [Alliance Leader]. The two of them sneaked into the cave, constantly observing the surrounding scenery with great vigilance.
0:15:51|0:16:2|In the bar, the trio of [Donggua] is having a great time drinking and playing. [Donggua] opens a capsule pill, pours the powder onto a piece of paper, and then swallows it in one gulp.
0:16:8|0:16:20|[Donggua] was about to pick up the bottle of wine and swallow the medicine. [Sha Sha] stopped him directly, and the aggrieved [Donggua] had to obediently drink water. [Donggua] looked foolishly at the couple singing next to him, with a silly smile on his face.
0:16:21|0:16:38|The next moment, the two embraced passionately, with [Donggua] watching in fascination. Inadvertently, he knocked over a bottle, interrupting the immersed couple. Both interrupted individuals looked a bit shy, avoiding direct eye contact and glancing around, but the smiles on their faces revealed their true feelings.
0:16:38|0:16:50|The two of them held hands and left in tacit agreement, leaving [Donggua] alone in the room to amuse himself. Just as the two outside were about to fall into an ambiguous atmosphere, the arrival of several uninvited guests made them flee in a panic.
0:17:0|0:17:14|Simple-minded [Donggua] managed to grab snacks on the table even in the midst of a life-threatening escape, truly a genuine foodie. The three of them were running desperately ahead, while the pursuers were hot on their heels from behind.
0:17:17|0:17:37|In the narrow space, only the echoing of footsteps could be heard. Several people hurriedly ran into a warehouse, hoping to hide from the pursuit behind by borrowing miscellaneous items. When Donggua ran past the cardboard boxes, he still didn't forget to push them down, creating obstacles for the pursuers behind.
0:17:37|0:17:50|At this moment, the three of them passed by the kitchen. [Donggua] casually locked the door, trying to cut off the people behind them. Obviously, the locked door did not help at all, and the pursuers behind easily opened it.
0:17:53|0:18:16|[Donggua] of the alliance picked up a plate and threw it behind him, while also grabbing a lamb leg to replenish energy. As the pursuers crossed obstacles and chased after him, [Donggua] calmly ate the lamb leg while running away. He reached the door, closed it, and then used the lamb leg to prop the door shut.
0:18:16|0:18:21|With this move, the pursuers were completely isolated inside the house, and [Donggua] and the other two managed to safely shake off the crowd.
0:18:24|0:18:48|[Donggua] ran past a car, then suddenly returned to the side of the car. With hands on hips, he glared fiercely at the little boy inside the car, looking like he was about to hit someone. Under the threat, the little boy had his lollipop taken away by [Donggua]. [Donggua] happily ate the candy, running joyfully.
0:18:48|0:18:53|While Donggua was resting on the side of the road, Sha Sha quickly asked how much money An Zi owed.
0:19:11|0:19:18|[Sha Sha] was suddenly at a loss and didn't know what to do. [Donggua] was captivated by the flag on the electric pole.
0:19:21|0:19:34|Unbeknownst to her, the man passing by also looked at the utility pole, but he was drawn to the love notes on it. He then dialed the player's phone number.
0:20:14|0:20:20|In the mall, [Sha Sha] closely followed the man on the elevator and, taking advantage of his distraction, skillfully stole his phone.
0:20:24|0:20:48|On the other side, [Sha Sha] is also searching for the target to strike. He pretends to bend down to tie his shoelaces, and smoothly cuts open the passing man's bag with a dagger, causing the wallet inside to fall out. [Sha Sha] swiftly tucks the wallet into his chest and then tosses it to [Donggua], who is snacking by the pillar, showing their perfect coordination.
0:20:52|0:21:1|At this moment, [Sha Sha] also returned to the meeting point of the three people, proudly handing the stolen phone to Donghua for safekeeping.
0:21:21|0:21:38|Xiao Xiaotian and Sha Sha passed by Donggua, who became their next target for theft. Hu Zi signaled to Donggua, who understood immediately and followed behind Sha Sha, looking for the opportunity to steal.
0:21:38|0:21:46|[Donggua] used the lollipop in his hand to throw Xianxian's phone out of her pocket, removed the phone case, and found it was an iPhone, secretly feeling pleased with himself.
0:21:51|0:22:0|Little did they know, the phone suddenly rang. Xianxian turned around and saw the phone in [Donggua]'s hand.
0:22:31|0:22:43|With Xianxian's shout, the security guards chased closely behind Donggua, Pure, and Miao Zi, forcing the three to run for their lives. After a chase, Donggua and Hu Zi were almost caught by the security guards.
0:22:48|0:23:1|The security guards watched with anger as the last three people escaped. As the saying goes, enemies meet with extra jealousy. [Xiao Xiaotian] and [Sha Sha] happened to run into [Alliance Leader] and others in the parking lot.
0:23:1|0:23:20|[An Zai] parked the car directly in front of [Xiao Xiaotian], making a warning gesture towards him, then took down [Xiao Xiaotian]'s license plate number before driving away. Inside the room, [Xiao Xiaotian] examined the jade pendant brought by [Miao Zi], his face heavy with concern, and then ordered the door to be closed before leaving.
0:24:9|0:24:18|[Xiao Xiaotian] tells Xianxian about his art of speaking. [Miao Zi] presses the elevator button, feeling extremely agitated, and kicks a nearby vase to vent her frustration.
0:24:20|0:24:24|Miao Zi, upon hearing the voice of the Alliance Leader, quickly found a place to hide.
0:24:44|0:25:6|While the [Alliance Leader] and [Miao Zi] were waiting for the elevator, [Miao Zi] hid in the shadows watching them, his mind calculating who knows what. After the two entered the elevator, [Miao Zi] hurried out and quickly returned to [Xiao Xiaotian]'s residence, throwing a piece of jade skin directly onto the table.
0:25:9|0:25:36|[Xiao Xiaotian] was attracted by the treasure map on the table. He never expected that [Miao Zi] would mistake the treasure map for a piece of scrap paper used to wrap jade. Successfully obtaining the treasure map, [Xiao Xiaotian] celebrated happily by the pool with Xianxian, unable to hide his excitement.
0:25:36|0:25:48|Sha Sha continued to play with the jade pendant in her hand, studying its origins. However, it was clear that what truly interested [Xiao Xiaotian] was the treasure map.
0:26:14|0:26:17|The treasure map hides a shocking secret behind it.
0:26:36|0:27:2|The [Alliance Leader] in the room is waiting for [Hu Zi] to bring in new recruits. Unexpectedly, it's [Donggua] who enters the room. [Hu Zi] warmly introduces [Donggua] to the [Alliance Leader] and picks up two chicken legs from the table, handing the smaller one to [Donggua].
0:27:12|0:27:24|[Hu Zi] kicked [Donggua]. [Donggua] looked at the two of them in confusion. [Hu Zi] was furious.
0:27:56|0:27:59|The Alliance Leader was amused by Donggua and burst into laughter.
0:28:26|0:28:52|Upon hearing this, Xiao Qian immediately went out to get money for [Miao Zi]. The next moment, she was kidnapped by [Alliance Leader]. [Miao Zi] tried to escape by jumping out of the window, but was caught by the arms by [Alliance Leader] and another person. The two sides were deadlocked.
0:29:13|0:29:16|At the critical moment, a familiar car sound, [Ba Ge] arrived.
0:29:33|0:29:55|Inside the curtains and under the sofa are hiding spots for everyone. Outside the window, [Miao Zi] is still hanging in mid-air, forgotten by all. [Alliance Leader] hurriedly pulls down the curtains. [Donggua] discovers a strange object under the coffee table, but without investigating, he hastily hides underneath and even remembers to bring the knife with him.
0:29:55|0:30:14|[Hu Zi] opened the wardrobe and hid inside. Just as he had concealed himself, the wardrobe door was opened by the [Alliance Leader]. It seemed that the [Alliance Leader] had also chosen this spot. [Alliance Leader] struck a pose, gave a signal with his eyes, and [Hu Zi] obediently gave up his place, even remembering to help [Alliance Leader] close the wardrobe door.
0:30:14|0:30:20|[Alliance Leader] sat down, and [Xiao Qian] quickly pushed the bag under the bed.
0:30:47|0:30:56|[Zhang Renfa] walked to the window and was about to pull open the curtains. The arrival of a phone call could possibly save [Xiao Qian] from her current crisis.
0:31:31|0:31:49|[Xiao Qian] turned around nervously and said. She dared not look directly at [Zhang Renfa]. But the more she acted this way, the heavier the doubts in [Zhang Renfa]'s heart became. Then he abruptly pulled open the curtains and looked outside. [Sha Sha] saw this and became restless, with her anxiety reaching its peak.
0:32:37|0:32:40|[Zhang Renfa]'s doubts in his heart were not dispelled.
0:32:55|0:33:22|[Sha Sha] pretended to prove herself, only to see [Donggua]. Just as she narrowly escaped, [Sha Sha] hurriedly went downstairs to see [Zhang Renfa] off. Inside the wardrobe, [Hu Zi] quickly opened the door and stepped out. The cramped space made his body extremely contorted and uncomfortable.
0:33:26|0:33:47|After coming out, Sha Sha politely knocked on the wardrobe door where the Alliance Leader was located, reminding the Alliance Leader to move away. Despite the Alliance Leader's inner nervousness, he still maintained his composure and refused to lose face in front of Hu Zi. Donggua then climbed down from the coffee table, picked up a small whip out of curiosity and gave it a playful flick.
0:33:49|0:34:1|Then he tucked the whip into his pants. [Hu Zi] roughly pulled [Miao Zi] up.
0:34:37|0:34:42|[Alliance Leader] at this moment was suppressing his anger, only wanting to know the whereabouts of the treasure map.
0:34:55|0:35:3|In this crisis situation, [Miao Zi] had to quickly insist that she was not lying. [Alliance Leader] kicked her to the ground with one foot.
0:35:23|0:35:31|[Donggua] held the small whip he found, intending to use it to tie up [Miao Zi]. [Hu Zi] looked on with curiosity.
0:35:34|0:35:40|[Hu Zi] tied up [Miao Zi], and with a command from the [Alliance Leader], kicked [Miao Zi] out.
0:35:44|0:35:52|Donggua's question made Xiaoqian blush. Anzi at the hotel entrance forcefully pulled Sha Sha's arm.
0:35:56|0:36:4|[Sha Sha] tenderly applies medicine to [An Zai]. [An Zai] notices that [Donggua] is not in the room.
0:36:11|0:36:16|Unable to see [Donggua]'s [An Zai], doubts arose in his heart. [Sha Sha] noticed the note on the table.
0:36:51|0:37:3|The phone kept ringing with no answer, leaving [Sha Sha] in suspense. The phone kept ringing with no answer for [Donggua].
0:37:11|0:37:32|In the dark night, [Xiao Xiaotian] and [Sha Sha] sensed that something was amiss in the cave and decided to investigate carefully. Inside the cave, the [Alliance Leader] was boredly playing with a lighter, waiting for his men to work. Suddenly, he heard footsteps outside, causing him to panic.
0:37:34|0:37:36|Lian Mang called [Hu Zi] over.
0:37:41|0:38:3|Hu Zi and Lian Mang crawled out of the cave to check the situation. The Alliance Leader adjusted the wreath, pretending to be in mourning. Miao Zi followed closely behind, also emerging from the underground hole. The three of them were in a panic. Just as Donggua stuck his head out of the hole, Miao Zi kicked him back in.
0:38:4|0:38:16|Soon after, the three of them covered the hole with iron sheets and used straw as a disguise. As the knocking on the door sounded, [Yang Shanshui] walked into the room.
0:38:56|0:38:59|This younger brother actually looks older than his older brother.
0:39:19|0:39:23|Yang Shangshui was about to leave when his attention was drawn to the bell on [Miao Zi]'s neck. [Miao Zi] shyly lowered her head.
0:40:9|0:40:18|[Donggua] made two gestures, causing [Alliance Leader] to doubt himself. [Hu Zi] explained on the side.
0:40:26|0:40:28|The Alliance Leader throws a clod at Donggua.
0:40:53|0:41:2|As the festive music plays, the countdown to the Yang family wedding begins. The guests arrive on time to witness the happiness of the couple.
0:41:24|0:41:47|Various luxury cars arrived, all showcasing Brother Fa's wealth and love for his daughter. Outside the cave dwellings, the [Alliance Leader] and his men kept a close eye on the wedding scene. Beside the main car, the groom gently led the bride out of the car and back to their home, where joyous celebrations were in full swing.
0:41:47|0:41:50|Guests also took this opportunity to reunite with friends and have a sincere conversation.
0:42:28|0:42:49|[Donggua] entered the cave first, followed closely by [Miao Zi]. After both of them entered the cave, [Alliance Leader] reminded [Hu Zi]. Then he also entered the cave.
0:42:51|0:43:10|The cave was dark, with no lights, so they had to rely on flashlights for illumination. The dim light from the flashlights made the cave even more eerie. [Donggua] found it amusing and kept giggling, completely unaware of the lurking danger in the cave. [Alliance Leader] led [Donggua] and another person, searching for direction inside the tomb, and they saw a kerosene lamp.
0:43:10|0:43:15|Miao Zi quickly stepped forward and lit the kerosene lamp.
0:43:17|0:43:31|Something magical happened, all the kerosene lamps in the cave lit up, once again revealing the mystery of the tomb. [Donggua] exclaimed excitedly.
0:43:32|0:43:45|[Alliance Leader] carefully observed the tomb, hoping to make a new discovery. Outside the tomb, [Hu Zi] and [Sha Sha] climbed over the wall in the moonlight, advancing towards the groom's house, ready to steal. [Hu Zi] tiptoed cautiously, not daring to make a sound.
0:43:47|0:44:5|[Qingqing] walked up the steps, opened the door, and gestured for [Sha Sha] to enter. [Sha Sha] quickly imitated [An Zai]'s manner. Inside the tomb, the three [Alliance Leader] were still searching aimlessly. The [Alliance Leader] pretended to be experienced, casual and carefree.
0:44:5|0:44:10|[An Zai] walked to the door of the bedroom, which was the room where the betrothal gifts were stored. He seemed to see money beckoning to him.
0:44:14|0:44:36|In the room, the groom was happily chatting, completely unaware of the impending danger. [Alliance Leader] carefully pushed open the bedroom door, walked quietly to the cabinet where the betrothal gifts were placed, ready to take action. At that moment, [Sha Sha] unexpectedly arrived at the table, picked up the bride's skincare products and started examining them. Indeed, the love for beauty is a woman's nature.
0:44:36|0:44:57|[An Zai] is indeed a skilled thief. He cautiously approaches the bed to check if the newcomer is already asleep. Seeing that all dangers have been eliminated, he finally prepares to steal. Beside the table, [Sha Sha] picks up skincare products and examines them carefully. If it weren't for the tense situation, she would have been ready to do some skincare on the spot.
0:45:3|0:45:22|The Alliance Leader signaled for Sha Sha to come over and help. Sha Sha reluctantly put down her skincare products and walked to An Zi's side, seeing a stack of red envelopes with joy on her face. The two of them started to prepare the betrothal gifts, looking nervous and trying to suppress their excitement, afraid of missing a single red envelope.
0:45:22|0:45:30|[An Zai]'s movements became more cautious, at this moment, what was in the bag seemed to be not just a simple betrothal gift, but their beautiful future.
0:45:33|0:45:43|After looting the money, the two quickly fled the scene. As they climbed over the wall, they still tightly held onto their backpacks.
0:45:48|0:45:59|In the tomb, [Alliance Leader] and the other two gradually found themselves in a predicament. They were wandering around in the maze-like tomb, feeling lost and tense.
0:46:2|0:46:29|They turned another corner and found themselves facing another unknown challenge. Gradually, they realized something was amiss as the surroundings became familiar. They had returned to a place they had been before, and the familiar sight immediately filled the three of them with panic.
0:46:29|0:46:31|The [Alliance Leader] also lost his composure at the beginning.
0:46:37|0:46:59|A look of panic appeared on their faces. The three of them quickened their pace, anxiously searching in the tomb, like ants on a hot pan in a frenzy. The [Alliance Leader] realized the urgency of the situation and decided that the three should split up to save time in the search.
0:47:21|0:47:34|[Miao Zi] didn't want to be alone, but had to obey. When the time was right, [Xiao Xiaotian] outside the cave led Xian Xian into the cave and tied up [Hu Zi].
0:47:36|0:47:57|Entering the cave, the [Alliance Leader], Mu Xue, and the other two leaned weakly against the wall. At this moment, the fear of being unable to escape enveloped them. Suddenly, the [Alliance Leader] had a bright idea, taking out his phone and flipping through the treasure map, hoping for a new discovery.
0:47:57|0:48:3|After a brief search, the [Alliance Leader] actually made a new discovery, looking at the two people beside him with surprise.
0:48:8|0:48:19|[Alliance Leader]'s words seemed to have reinvigorated the three of them. They followed a rope down to a spacious area. [Alliance Leader] gestured for [Miao Zi] to go first.
0:48:21|0:48:30|Even though [Miao Zi] was unwilling, he had no choice but to comply. He could be seen walking carefully in front, with [Donggua] following closely behind him.
0:48:32|0:48:52|Suddenly, [Miao Zi] stepped into a trap and almost fell in. Fortunately, [Alliance Leader] quickly pulled him out, and the three of them looked at the scene in the trap with puzzled expressions. [Alliance Leader] quickly opened the treasure map on his phone again and said confidently.
0:48:52|0:49:9|[Alliance Leader] once again signaled for [Miao Zi] to take the lead. This time, [Miao Zi] cautiously moved forward along the wall, with [Donggua] following closely behind, trembling in fear of stepping on a trap. [Alliance Leader] at this moment was also unable to remain calm within the wall, following closely behind [Donggua].
0:49:9|0:49:14|The three of them were too busy to notice [Xiao Xiaotian] and Xianxian behind them.
0:49:17|0:49:42|[Xiao Xiaotian] and [Alliance Leader] were obviously in a much better situation than [Hu Zi], [Miao Zi], and [Donggua]. It was clear that they were well-prepared and experienced. [Xiao Xiaotian] opened the treasure map confidently, with a victorious look on his face, as if saying "I have the world in my hands", and then pointed out the correct direction. Looking back at the Nine Turns Yellow River Formation.
0:49:46|0:49:58|[Alliance Leader] The three of them arrived at a narrow space, with a stone door blocking their way. [Alliance Leader] looked around and stated that there were hidden mysteries in this place.
0:50:10|0:50:23|The Alliance Leader then decided to change tactics and called for the three people pushing the door to stop.
0:50:29|0:50:35|On the wall, a unique stone statue caught the attention of the [Alliance Leader].
0:50:43|0:51:2|[Alliance Leader] gave a signal with his eyes. [Miao Zi] stepped forward and tried to twist the stone statue. Sure enough, there was a hidden mechanism, and the statue began to rotate. With a loud rumble, the stone door slowly opened on its own. The three of them decided to see what was inside.
0:51:6|0:51:27|Entering the stone gate, what came into view was a huge room with a eerie layout. Three people, using flashlights, slowly searched for clues. The only sound in the room was the noisy footsteps, giving off a creepy vibe. Soon, the three set their sights on a certain spot.
0:51:27|0:51:52|On the other side, [Xiao Xiaotian] and Xianxian also noticed the corner entering the room. Another magical scene happened in the room. The lights all turned on in an instant. The central stone pillar looked particularly eye-catching. [Alliance Leader] and the other two stood closely around the pillar, showing a fascinated expression.
0:51:52|0:51:59|At this moment, [Alliance Leader] only had the Yang Family Sword in his eyes. A victorious smile bloomed on his face.
0:52:1|0:52:6|The Alliance Leader seemed to see a million people waving at him.
0:52:30|0:52:42|[Alliance Leader] shouted at [Miao Zi]. [Miao Zi] took out the Yang Family Sword and handed it to [Alliance Leader] eagerly. [Alliance Leader] took the Yang Family Sword, tightly gripped it in his hand, with a big smile on his face.
0:52:50|0:53:7|He walked out of the room with the Yang Family Sword, a smile on his face, unaware that danger was about to strike. [Xiao Xiaotian], who had been waiting outside for a long time, saw [Alliance Leader] step into the trap he had set. Taking advantage of the chaos, [Xiao Xiaotian] snatched the sword and ran, leaving behind the wailing of [Alliance Leader] and his two companions.
0:53:9|0:53:28|[Xiao Xiaotian] hurriedly took Xianxian away from the sight of the [Alliance Leader], observing the surroundings in a safe area, feeling excited. On the way out of Yangjia City, [Sha Sha] saw a familiar car, and upon closer inspection, it turned out to be [Xiao Xiaotian]'s car.
0:53:28|0:53:34|It is said that retribution may not be immediate, but the time has come. In this perfect opportunity, how could [Sha Sha] let it slip by.
0:53:36|0:53:56|Shortly after parking the car on the side of the road, waiting for [Xiao Xiaotian] to arrive, the hatred from the Joy Department Store. The two of them ran out of the tomb and quickly came to the car, opened the trunk, put the backpack in, and prepared to drive away.
0:53:56|0:54:2|Sitting in the driver's seat, [Xiao Xiaotian] still couldn't hide his excitement, constantly studying the object borrowed from the Yang family.
0:54:12|0:54:48|[Xiao Xiaotian] quickly took the sword, looking excited. [Xiao Xiaotian] made an impolite request with it. A dagger was placed in front of [Xiao Xiaotian], and [An Zai] pushed the two of them against the car door.
0:54:48|0:55:5|[Sha Sha] immediately took out Xiao Xiaotian's backpack and started rummaging through it. As she was searching, Alliance Leader's expression suddenly changed drastically. He pulled out an item from the bag and found it to be a handgun. Alliance Leader's face was filled with disbelief as he carefully examined the gun and aimed it at Xiao Xiaotian.
0:55:11|0:55:33|[An Zai] put the gun behind him for emergencies, then continued to search in the bag, turning it upside down. He unexpectedly found the Yang Family Sword, obviously unaware of the sword's mystery.
0:55:41|0:55:45|[An Zai] and [Sha Sha] initiated the evacuation, with [Xiao Xiaotian] leading the two away.
0:55:51|0:56:11|Sha Sha took a hairpin from her head and tried to unlock the handcuffs. After some effort, the handcuffs were indeed opened. Then she found a card in the back seat, which had the address where "An Zai" lived written on it. Xiao Xiaotian decided to seek revenge.
0:56:11|0:56:20|[Alliance Leader], along with a few others, left the cave under the moonlight, only to find nothing after a busy search. [An Zai] and [Sha Sha] returned to the inn and discovered that their room key was missing.
0:56:50|0:57:3|[An Zai] at this moment, there are more important matters to attend to, so he couldn't be bothered to argue with the shopkeeper. He quickly persuaded [Sha Sha] to leave, and [Sha Sha], considering the betrothal gift, did not waste any more time with the shopkeeper.
0:57:13|0:57:30|[An Zai] pulled the curtains closed, [Sha Sha] opened her backpack, [An Zai] kept moving non-stop. She took out the Yang Family Sword from the bag and casually threw it on the bed. The bed was piled with various items, [Sha Sha] couldn't wait to pour out all the red envelopes, a bed full of cash stimulating her eyes.
0:57:30|0:57:43|Here, Sha Sha is still playing with the Yang Family Sword, she never understands the secret of this sword, and doesn't understand why Xiao Xiaotian always carries a broken sword with him. Alliance Leader looks at the money and can't help but laugh.
0:57:47|0:57:51|The action of counting money in hand did not stop at all.
0:57:59|0:58:3|[An Zai] had already planned the use of money in his heart.
0:59:3|0:59:13|[Hu Zi] gave [Miao Zi] a slap in the face, and [Miao Zi] sprayed the wine directly at [Alliance Leader]. [Alliance Leader], unable to contain his anger, picked up a baseball bat and threw it over.
0:59:17|0:59:29|[Donggua] shook his candy box on the side and poured out a piece of candy. Eating the candy to gather courage, he nervously walked towards the [Alliance Leader] and asked.
0:59:51|0:59:55|The Alliance Leader grabs Donggua's ear.
1:0:3|1:0:14|[Donggua] has never been so angry before. He stood still, spat out a mouthful of saliva to suppress his anger, and silently walked to the side.
1:0:17|1:0:29|[An Zai] walked to the bridge with the snacks he just bought, stood still, and was about to call [Donggua] again.
1:0:58|1:1:1|[Donggua] and [An Zai]’s conversation was overheard by [Alliance Leader].
1:1:12|1:1:16|[Donggua] looked at [Alliance Leader] in a panic.
1:1:45|1:1:49|[Donggua] tried to escape but was caught and brought back. [Yaozi] stood by and watched, witnessing [Donggua]'s misery.
1:2:18|1:2:25|[Huayin] has just fallen, and [Miao Zi] has also been tied up. Both [Miao Zi] and [Donggua] are tied to the wall, one upside down and the other right side up.
1:2:48|1:3:12|In the inn, [Sha Sha] is immersed in the happiness of money, unaware of what is about to happen. Outside the door, a man holding a card walks slowly with melodious music, showing his elegance. As the knocking sound is heard, [Sha Sha] quickly packs up the money and goes to open the door.
1:3:12|1:3:15|Opening the door, Sha Sha sees a seductive puppet man.
1:3:20|1:3:25|The man's words were unexpectedly frivolous.
1:4:5|1:4:9|At the critical moment, [An Zai] arrives in time to rescue [Sha Sha].
1:5:7|1:5:13|[Sha Sha] insisted on going to Room 611 to check the situation, and before going upstairs, she didn't forget the backpack on the bed. After much consideration, she decided to take the backpack with her.
1:5:35|1:5:58|[Xiao Xiaotian] and [Sha Sha] arrived outside the inn, with [Xiao Xiaotian] almost falling down with a gun in hand. The two of them stood by room 119, pressing their ears against the door to listen for any movement inside. Carefully, [Xiao Xiaotian] unlocked the door and then covered the peephole. Finding no one inside, they took out the room key that [An Zi] had lost.
1:6:0|1:6:8|Sha Sha rolled into the room as the door opened, leaving Xiao Xiaotian to shout helplessly.
1:6:11|1:6:24|[Alliance Leader] is tidying up outside the inn, preparing for a fight. [Hu Zi], strong and imitating [Alliance Leader]'s appearance. Inside the room, [Xiao Xiaotian] is flipping his palms around, still without any success, feeling a bit anxious.
1:6:32|1:6:51|Take down the photo on the wall first. [Alliance Leader] and [Sha Sha] outside the room hear the noise inside, then take out their equipment, ready to enter combat mode. [Xiao Xiaotian] turns around and finds himself in a crisis. [Hu Zi] cooperates tacitly by lifting his leg, allowing [Alliance Leader] to light the lighter on his leg.
1:6:56|1:7:5|It is obvious that [Xiao Xiaotian] is at a disadvantage, standing still in a daze.
1:7:13|1:7:34|[An Zai] and [Sha Sha] came out of room 611, laughing and chatting as they returned to the room, only to see [Xiao Xiaotian] being kicked out from inside. The two were shocked and then witnessed [Xiao Xiaotian] being dragged back into the room. Seeing this, [An Zai] quickly grabbed [Sha Sha] and fled.
1:7:34|1:7:40|In the room, [Xiao Xiaotian] and Xianxian are tied up. [Xiao Xiaotian] looks puzzled.
1:7:58|1:8:9|[Alliance Leader] slammed the table with a knife, accidentally displaying his strong martial arts skills. Seeing this, [Hu Zi] was so scared that he quickly withdrew his hand.
1:8:24|1:8:35|[Hu Zi] took out his phone, opened a photo, and questioned. [Sha Sha] and [Xiao Xiaotian] hurried forward to listen.
1:8:58|1:9:6|[Alliance Leader] decides to use [Donggua] to threaten [An Zai] to show up. Xiao Xiaotian smiles bitterly, hoping that [Alliance Leader] will let the two of them go.
1:9:8|1:9:19|[An Zai] and [Sha Sha] fled, realizing something was wrong, they kept calling [Donggua], but no one answered.
1:9:30|1:9:36|[An Zai] noticed the unusualness of the sword, took it out from the bag, and examined it carefully, filled with doubts in his heart.
1:9:43|1:9:46|In the police station, the police received a report.
1:9:51|1:10:12|Upon receiving the report, the police immediately drove to the scene of the crime to search for clues. Upon arriving at the Yang residence, they began their investigation, gathering evidence in the burglarized room and preparing to bring it back to the police station for analysis.
1:10:14|1:10:18|Inside the house, [Zhang Renfa] was already furious, for him,
1:10:46|1:10:49|Suddenly, the groom thought of something.
1:10:56|1:11:8|The groom sensed something was wrong. Leading everyone to the cave, what they saw was a huge hole.
1:12:3|1:12:28|[Alliance Leader] Hu Zi used [Donggua] and [Miao Zi] as his punching bags, continuously hitting them with a baseball bat and smashing medicine bottles on them. Fa Ge made a phone call to the leader of the [Blackie] gang.
1:13:1|1:13:21|[Zhang Renfa] made a phone call to the boss [Heizi]. [Zhang Renfa] angrily hung up the phone, leaving the boss [Heizi] puzzled. The more the boss [Heizi] thought about it, the angrier he got. Inside the warehouse, [Alliance Leader] was practicing with the ball when the phone rang from the boss [Heizi].
1:13:21|1:13:33|[Alliance Leader] immediately frowned, exchanged a glance with [Hu Zi], and finally answered the phone. [Alliance Leader] made a sudden decision to go for a double cross.
1:14:5|1:14:13|After finishing the explanation, [Heizi] arrogantly hung up the phone. Xiao Xiaotian looked at [Alliance Leader] in confusion.
1:14:33|1:14:37|[Hu Zi] gritted his teeth and cursed when mentioning [Heizi]. He was furious and jumped up in anger.
1:14:57|1:15:16|Picking up a stick, [Xiao Xiaotian] was beaten and screamed in pain, running and howling as the sound echoed throughout the warehouse. After beating [Xiao Xiaotian], the [Alliance Leader] and [Hu Zi] arrived in front of [Miao Zi] and [Donggua].
1:15:32|1:15:49|The Alliance Leader was unexpectedly kind, helping Donggua untie the ropes. Donggua, ignoring his bound feet, hopped forward. However, he was kicked down by Hu Zi, realizing the danger and crawling forward in fear.
1:16:18|1:16:30|[Alliance Leader] issued a threat, which scared [Donggua] so much that his voice started to tremble. He quickly dialed [Anzi]'s phone number. When [Anzi] saw it was [Donggua], he immediately asked.
1:16:49|1:16:52|The Alliance Leader snatched the phone away.
1:17:16|1:17:34|The plane slowly landed, and [Hu Zi], the boss, arrived at the God's Tomb. His first action was not to get the sword from the Yang family, but to take his little brothers out for a ride. [Hu Zi] drove on the beach with four little brothers following closely behind him, without a care in the world.
1:17:37|1:18:2|[An Zai] and [Sha Sha] made up their minds to rescue [Donggua]. The two of them arrived at the warehouse as planned, intending to first check the situation inside the warehouse. They crouched under the window and cautiously peeked inside the house. [An Zai] carefully lay flat at the window, afraid of being discovered by the people inside.
1:18:2|1:18:7|In his sight were several familiar faces tied up and the two people drinking and eating meat, the [Alliance Leader].
1:18:9|1:18:29|[Donggua] was tied up with his arms, curled up in the corner, with [Miao Zi] hanging upside down next to him. [An Zai] and [Sha Sha] discussed a rescue plan. At this moment, the two of them were at a loss, not knowing what to do.
1:18:39|1:19:0|[Sha Sha] immediately decided to wait for the right moment and stay put. Suddenly, a noise came from a distance. As they waited, a car drove up. The car stopped right behind [Sha Sha], putting them both in danger.
1:19:2|1:19:19|Fortunately, [Hu Zi] was solely focused on the Yang Family Sword and did not notice the suspicious vehicle. The group led by [Hu Zi] entered the warehouse aggressively, even remembering to inform [Miao Zi]. However, with the Yang Family Sword already lost, how will the [Alliance Leader] respond?
1:19:30|1:19:45|One of the henchmen opened the safe, inside of which was a pile of cucumbers. Hu Zi picked one up and started eating it. It was clear that Hu Zi had a special fondness for cucumbers.
1:19:45|1:19:58|[Sha Sha] eats a cucumber while leading his gang towards the warehouse. He kicks open the warehouse door and then advances towards [Alliance Leader] and others step by step, creating a sense of oppression.
1:20:12|1:20:27|[Hu Zi] pulled Xianxian, who was sitting on the chair, and gave up his seat to [Heizi]. With a casual gesture from [Alliance Leader], who didn't even put his feet down on the table, he signaled for [Heizi] to take a seat.
1:20:33|1:20:37|[Heizi] immediately felt that his dignity was being scorned.
1:21:8|1:21:18|A gesture, the henchmen walked towards [Xiao Xiaotian]. The henchmen directly brought [Xiao Xiaotian] in front of [Heizi] and started to reprimand him.
1:21:26|1:21:58|Xiao Xiaotian on this side is beaten to the brink of death, while on the other side, Donggua and Miao Zi, who are hanging, seem unaffected, even sharing snacks. Alliance Leader leans against the wall analyzing the situation inside the warehouse, and a child in front of him sparks a brilliant idea in his mind.
1:21:58|1:22:19|The child ran into the warehouse as instructed by [An Zai], handing a note to [Heizi]. After reading the note, [Heizi] felt challenged and immediately threw the cucumber in his hand, pulling out a gun and pointing it at the [Alliance Leader].
1:22:40|1:22:46|[Alliance Leader] was tied up by [Hu Zi]'s men before he could figure out what was happening.
1:22:50|1:23:5|At this point, the [Alliance Leader] still wanted to maintain his final dignity. The next moment, he was tied up in the corner with [Donggua] and others. The scene was somewhat poignant and amusing. [Hu Zi] tied up the people in the warehouse and then took them away.
1:23:5|1:23:20|[An Zai] and [Sha Sha] were afraid of being discovered by [Hei Zi], so they played a game of hide and seek by the car. They circled around to the front of the car, risking danger as they waited for [Hei Zi] and his group to get on the car and leave. Just as [An Zai] and [Sha Sha] were about to enter the warehouse to rescue [Donggua].
1:23:26|1:23:38|Another car drove up not far away, scaring them into hastily hiding behind the car to observe the situation. Getting out of the car were [Zhang Renfa] and Xiao Qian, it seems [Zhang Renfa] is also eager to get the Yang Family Sword.
1:23:38|1:23:55|[Sha Sha] and [Alliance Leader] circled around the car, watching as [Hu Zi] and his group entered the warehouse. They were already planning their next move, keeping a close eye on [Hu Zi] from behind the car. As soon as [Hu Zi] stepped into the warehouse, he was shocked by what he saw inside.
1:23:59|1:24:6|Qianqian looked at [Miao Zi], who was hanging upside down on the wall, her body stiffening instantly, unsure of what to do.
1:24:15|1:24:20|[Zhang Renfa] is searching everywhere for [Xiao Xiaotian]. He is seen picking up a baseball bat.
1:25:16|1:25:32|[Zhang Renfa] didn't make a move, just raised the baseball bat in his hand. [Xiao Xiaotian] was so scared that he fainted. [Zhang Renfa] walked up to the bound crowd with his henchmen.
1:25:43|1:25:52|Hu Zi noticed Miao Zi hanging there, while Sha Sha looked at Miao Zi with a sense of inner turmoil.
1:26:5|1:26:11|The Alliance Leader was filled with doubt upon hearing the secret, while Hu Zi became interested.
1:26:37|1:26:46|[Hu Zi] said this, causing [Zhang Renfa] to turn and look at [Sha Sha], who was in a panic, with fear in her eyes.
1:26:55|1:26:59|[Sha Sha] lost her fake smile from earlier, her gaze now fierce.
1:27:24|1:27:28|[Sha Sha] could only do as [Zhang Renfa] said and crouched down.
1:27:52|1:28:8|[Miao Zi] quickly explained. Xiao Qian was ruthlessly pushed away by [Zhang Renfa]. [Zhang Renfa] noticed the device on [Miao Zi]'s neck.
1:28:18|1:28:27|Xiao Qian was so scared that she didn't know what to do, [Zhang Renfa] snatched the phone away.
1:28:53|1:29:5|[Zhang Renfa] turned to look at Xiao Qian, obviously completely angered by Xiao Qian's actions.
1:29:36|1:29:40|Angered, he ordered his men to tie up Xiao Qian as well.
1:29:47|1:29:51|[Zhang Renfa] at this moment didn't care about settling scores with Xiao Qian, only the Yang Family Sword was on his mind.
1:30:1|1:30:19|Michelle was left to guard everyone as the others departed. The roaring engine highlighted Zhang Renfa's urgency. It wasn't until Zhang Renfa had walked far away that An Zai and his companion emerged from behind the car. An Zai pulled out a fake gun from behind him, intending to intimidate Michelle with it. At this moment, the gun finally came in handy.
1:30:19|1:30:23|[Heizi] gradually realized that something was wrong while waiting.
1:30:38|1:30:49|Immediately arrange for [Alliance Leader] to take two subordinates back to the warehouse. Michelle raised her hands in fright. [Donggua] quickly called for help.
1:30:55|1:30:58|[Donggua] saw [Sha Sha] and immediately acted cute, asking her to help him untie himself.
1:31:4|1:31:21|[An Zai] discovered that there was another person tied up on the chair. When he lifted his head, he found that it was actually [Xiao Xiaotian].
1:31:24|1:31:39|Seeing the current miserable state of [Xiao Xiaotian], feeling secretly pleased, only [Xiao Xiaotian] is left in a state of panic. Outside the door, [Sha Sha] is leading two henchmen, walking towards the warehouse. [Sha Sha] is examining the sword, and upon hearing the noise outside the door, shouts loudly.
1:31:44|1:32:4|[An Zai] and [Donggua] quickly picked up baseball bats each and hid at the warehouse entrance, ready to ambush. [Sha Sha] entered the warehouse with two henchmen, and [Donggua] immediately knocked out one of the henchmen with a bat. Seeing this, [An Zai] got scared and [Sha Sha] screamed as they ran away.
1:32:4|1:32:10|[Heizi] couldn't reach [Sha Sha] and drove back to the warehouse in frustration, finding the group of people tied up in the corner somewhat comical.
1:32:52|1:33:0|Outside the warehouse, the sound of a car is heard again, making [Sha Sha] and the others even more nervous. The Alliance Leader has arrived, and Sha Sha quickly comes up with a plan to deal with the situation.
1:33:5|1:33:21|Have [Sha Sha] hide, stay away from danger, while leading [Donggua] to hide at the door again, ready to ambush. [Hu Zi] opens the warehouse door, sensing something is wrong, cautiously observing as he enters the warehouse. With a shout from [Miao Zi], [Hu Zi] is knocked unconscious by [Miao Zi].
1:33:21|1:33:26|[Sha Sha] Some people looked at the increasing number of people tied up in the corner of the wall, feeling helpless and unsure of how to handle the situation.
1:33:34|1:33:55|[An Zai] noticed. Outside the door, a familiar car drove up, it turned out to be [Zhang Renfa] returning. [Zhang Renfa] got out of the car in a hurry and headed towards the warehouse. Seeing this familiar scene, [Sha Sha] conscientiously assigned herself a task.
1:33:55|1:34:0|[Sha Sha] led [Donggua] to decide to use the old trick again, and they stood at the entrance of the warehouse.
1:34:5|1:34:34|Hu Zi was knocked unconscious with a stick by Xiao Xiaotian. Xiao Xiaotian took out a dagger from his pants to cut the rope and free himself. Just as Alliance Leader and the others decided to give up on tying up the swords and leave, the sound of a car outside the warehouse rang out again, and the police arrived.
1:34:35|1:34:42|Several police cars parked steadily at the entrance of the warehouse, then the police raised their guns and rushed into the warehouse.
1:34:49|1:35:6|[An Zai] and the others were still unaware of the urgency of the situation, but [Sha Sha] unexpectedly requested to join the operation. They didn't notice at all that [Xiao Xiaotian], who had been tied to a chair, had already escaped through the window. They saw [Xiao Xiaotian] turn his shirt inside out, revealing a police uniform on the other side.
1:35:11|1:35:15|The police officer's question let [Xiao Xiaotian] know that he had been discovered.
1:35:20|1:35:32|The police raised their guns and surrounded the crowd in the corner, capturing everyone and obeying the police's orders. With that, the theft case of the Yang family finally came to an end.
