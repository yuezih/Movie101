0:4:59|0:5:17|[Yi Yao] stubbornly picked up the tissue, used it and then threw it fiercely into the trash can. On the other side, the mother was busy massaging and wiping the massage chair, while [Yi Yao] quickly walked over, using a plastic bag to pack up two pieces of steamed bread.
0:5:25|0:5:38|The mother threw the chopsticks on the table, which happened to hit Qi Ming's bicycle at the door. Qi Ming's mother next to him was unhappy, and Qi Ming looked at Yi Yao.
0:5:49|0:6:2|Turning around, [Qi Ming] saw [Yi Yao] squatting on the ground picking up chopsticks, while [Qi Ming]'s mother gave a disdainful glance at [Yi Yao]'s mother before leaving. [Yi Yao]'s mother, unwilling to back down, slammed the door shut fiercely. [Yi Yao] then pushed her bicycle around the alleyway.
0:6:2|0:6:15|She found [Qi Ming] waiting for her in the car. Seeing [Yi Yao] approaching, [Qi Ming] took out a bottle of milk from his bag and said
0:6:24|0:6:37|In the alley, childhood sweethearts are not as difficult to deal with as the elders. Soon, two cars drove out of the alley, one after the other. [Yi Yao] suddenly saw on the pedestrian walkway across the street, a girl being bullied on campus.
0:6:44|0:7:6|The girl named [Tang Xiaomi] could only bow her head and be at the mercy of others. [Yi Yao] and [Qi Ming] have arrived at the school gate. In the crowd, everyone took off their coats, revealing the new school uniforms and walking into the campus. Among them, [Yi Yao] in the old-style uniform stood out conspicuously.
0:7:6|0:7:15|[Yi Yao] came to the bathroom, leaning against the door panel, looking at the mirror with a vacant expression. She gently turned on the faucet, and her haggard face was reflected in the sink.
0:7:15|0:7:32|She recalled the information she found in the library. That day, [Yi Yao] opened the search page with full of questions, but she didn't expect her own brows to furrow tighter and tighter. The webpage listed many reasons for girls' lower body pain, making [Yi Yao] nervous.
0:7:32|0:7:47|She unconsciously clenched her hands and continued searching. The popped-up webpage was filled with various disturbing words and images, such as genital herpes, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual activities, and so on. Each keyword was like a heavy blow.
0:7:47|0:8:4|The blow struck hard at the heart of this young girl. How can a student who is still inexperienced in the ways of the world bear such unspeakable pain? She bit her lip, furrowing her brow tightly as she stared at the screen, with words and images that struck her soul deeply continuously flashing in her mind.
0:8:37|0:9:0|In the corridor, the girls were smiling and posing in various ways. The center of attention, [Tang Xiaomi], looked particularly dazzling. After taking a photo, [Yi Yao] was pushed aside by boys as she prepared to enter the classroom, looking displeased. On the blackboard, in large letters, it said, "Welcome new student [Tang Xiaomi]."
0:9:9|0:9:29|[Yi Yao] recalled the girl who had a cup of milk tea poured on her head across the street in the morning. Not wanting to dwell on it, [Yi Yao] turned around to start erasing the blackboard. After shaking her head, [Yi Yao] quickly finished erasing the blackboard and walked down from the platform. [Tang Xiaomi] stared at [Yi Yao]'s back, pondering something unknown.
0:9:29|0:9:50|[Yi Yao] had just returned to her seat when [Qi Ming] walked over and asked with concern. Sitting across from [Yi Yao], [Qi Ming] eagerly inquired, while [Tang Xiaomi] opened a book and secretly glanced towards [Qi Ming]. Several girls around [Tang Xiaomi] exchanged glances and gathered around her, creating a lively scene.
0:10:17|0:10:27|[Qi Ming] knew [Yi Yao]'s stubborn nature and didn't ask further. Fortunately, he got up and left, patting [Yi Yao]'s head before leaving. However, this scene was noticed by [Tang Xiaomi] who was standing nearby.
0:10:27|0:10:49|In the auditorium, one by one, the spotlights lit up the banner on the stage, which read "2007 Peace High School Outstanding Student Commendation Ceremony." The students all rushed towards the auditorium, while in the crowd, a figure in an old-fashioned school uniform walked alone in the opposite direction. A female student with a crutch hobbled down from the audience seats and approached the stage, casting a graceful shadow.
0:10:49|0:11:6|Especially eye-catching, the girl named [Gu Senxiang] gave up her front row seat and helped the girl with crutches to sit down. She then took a few steps back and found an empty seat to sit in. In the front row, [Qi Ming] was giving a familiar award acceptance speech.
0:11:10|0:11:27|[Tang Xiaomi] looked admiringly at [Qi Ming], while [Qi Ming] sent a text message to [Yi Yao] inquiring about the hospital. The girl with a limp picked up her phone, and [Gu Senxiang] leaned forward, trying to reach for the phone across the seats, her beautiful hair inadvertently draping over [Qi Ming]'s shoulder.
0:11:27|0:11:37|[Qi Ming] caught a whiff of fragrance and couldn't help but look at her delicate features. The outstanding student [Gu Senxiang] was hard to miss in the crowd, but she couldn't reach her phone with her outstretched hand. [Qi Ming] clapped his hands and said,
0:11:45|0:11:52|A casual remark brought a smile to the lips of two people. [Qi Ming] continued to look at the script, but couldn't hide the joy in his eyes.
0:11:52|0:12:18|[Gu Senxiang] was openly smiling, the award-winning students lined up, the teacher presented bouquets to the students, [Qi Ming] took the bouquet and bowed, but as he stood up, the bouquet bumped into [Gu Senxiang]. She sneezed and stepped back, waving her hands to signal she was fine, then instinctively used the certificate of honor to cover her nose and mouth. [Qi Ming] felt a bit embarrassed and said:
0:12:20|0:12:47|[Gu Senxiang] just used the certificate to cover her face without saying a word, while on the hospital bed, [Yi Yao] stared with anxious eyes, looking fearfully at the overhead surgical light. Despite her usual strength, at this moment, she tightly gripped the bed rails, feeling extremely nervous. As the doctor reached for tools and extended them into [Yi Yao]'s legs, she tried hard to calm herself down as she listened to the doctor's instructions. However, tears uncontrollably slid down her cheeks, unexpectedly.
0:12:47|0:12:56|[Qi Ming] was waiting in the hospital consultation room at this time. Beside him sat [Gu Senxiang], with flushed cheeks covered in small pimples. She nodded obediently, listening to the doctor's words.
0:13:13|0:13:40|The doctor in the examination room took off his gloves and walked back to the office to start writing medical records. Yi Yao, who had put on his clothes, got off the bed. Hearing this, Yi Yao walked over in shock with wide eyes. The doctor looked at Yi Yao in school uniform, glanced at the medical records, and continued.
0:13:40|0:13:48|[Yi Yao] shook her head in a distressed manner with a furrowed brow.
0:14:21|0:14:45|[Yi Yao]'s brows furrowed tighter and tighter, her red eyes filled with tears. The expensive medical expenses, the tense mother-daughter relationship, the unbearable pain that she couldn't bring herself to talk about, all weighed heavily on her heart. Tears blurred her vision as she stumbled towards the elevator. Everything happened so suddenly, and being from a poor family, she didn't know how to bear it. Passing patients and nurses couldn't help but look at this distressed girl. As soon as the elevator doors opened, [Yi Yao] rushed in.
0:14:45|0:15:1|She was huddled in the corner of the elevator, crying with her head down. [Gu Senxi], who was on his way to visit his sister, felt a bit at a loss. He glanced over and noticed that she was a fellow student from the same school. Timidly, he stepped forward and greeted her.
0:15:8|0:15:18|The elevator door opened at this moment, and a family of three entered. [Gu Senxi] nervously said, then quickly walked out of the elevator, afraid of being misunderstood.
0:15:35|0:15:54|Not finished yet, [Yi Yao] has already entered the elevator, while [Qi Ming] on the other side apologized. [Gu Senxiang] smiled and responded to [Qi Ming], lowered her head, looked helplessly at the bouquet in her hand, sighed softly, and the two walked side by side in the hospital lobby. [Qi Ming] reached out to adjust [Gu Senxiang]'s backpack straps.
0:15:55|0:16:1|[Gu Senxi] looked around and saw her sister,
0:17:8|0:17:33|[Qi Ming] looked at the gradually fading figures of the two siblings with a smile, feeling relieved. Inside the alley house, [Yi Yao] held a tube of ointment and stared at the packaging box for a while before putting it down. She raised her hand to flip through the thin medical record book on the table, while her mother in the other room was sewing clothes at the table, the dim light shining on their faces from the buttons, each with their own thoughts. [Yi Yao] crumpled the medical record in her hands.
0:17:35|0:17:40|The mother's strictness did not allow her to resist, but [Yi Yao] brought the hatpin and refused to leave?
0:18:5|0:18:15|The harsh words made [Yi Yao] angrily leave. She returned to the inner room and had just sat down when her mother continued.
0:18:23|0:18:51|[Yi Yao] closed his eyes in pain, while [Qi Ming] rode his bicycle with a bouquet of flowers in the front basket, slowly moving along the small path in the alley. Perhaps recalling something, the young man couldn't help but smile slightly, with even his eyes and eyebrows curving. Meanwhile, [Yi Yao] was struggling, unable to smile due to the heavy burden on his mind during dinner. In the end, he could only helplessly furrow his brow.
0:18:51|0:19:7|Continue cooking. In front of the small window is the busy figure of [Yi Yao]. As [Qi Ming] passed by, he stopped his bicycle and looked inside. Two bell rings sounded like a secret code, and [Yi Yao] quickly arrived at the window. [Qi Ming] greeted her through the window, saying:
0:19:58|0:20:6|[Qi Ming]'s mother walked out of the house at some point, and soon [Qi Ming] pushed the cart back. As they got closer, the mother asked:
0:20:11|0:20:24|[Qi Ming] obediently followed his mother into the house, [Yi Yao] watched as [Qi Ming] left, then lowered her head to smell the first bouquet of flowers she had ever received in her life. Beautiful flowers against dilapidated walls.
0:20:24|0:20:41|The old window looked out of place, while [Yi Yao] held the bouquet tightly in her arms, sniffing it as if afraid it would wither tomorrow. The cool night breeze carried the scent of flowers past the window, through the alley, and over the girl's heart.
0:21:20|0:21:26|[Gu Senxi] looked at the back of [Yi Yao] and smirked, but was caught by the teacher.
0:21:31|0:21:42|[Gu Senxi] answered the teacher in a snatching manner, saying the same words. The teacher was stunned, but [Gu Senxi] didn't care. As soon as the teacher left, he looked out the window and a smile appeared on his face again.
0:22:8|0:22:20|The bell rang, and the students all got up to move around. [Yi Yao] wearily rested his head on the desk, while the boy in front of him turned around excitedly to say something. Meanwhile, [Tang Xiaomi] glared angrily at [Yi Yao]'s back from her seat.
0:22:31|0:22:37|[Tang Xiaomi] walked over joyfully.
0:23:5|0:23:16|[Qi Ming] asked somewhat awkwardly, as [Tang Xiaomi] took the homework book from the squad leader's arms and turned around to make an OK gesture towards the girls.
0:23:18|0:23:26|In the bustling alley at dusk, [Qi Ming] comes down from the loft bed, tidies up his clothes, and greets his family.
0:23:34|0:23:49|At the same time, [Yi Yao] was watering the flowers by the window. Yes, she put the bouquet into the vase. [Qi Ming] passed by, and [Yi Yao] looked at [Qi Ming] with an unpleasant expression on her face, then suddenly closed her eyes and fell down.
0:24:3|0:24:10|He hurriedly flipped over [Yi Yao]'s body, without much thought, immediately picked up [Yi Yao] and ran towards the outside of the house, on the narrow alley in the late night.
0:24:47|0:25:4|In the childhood amusement park, [Yi Yao] celebrated her birthday at a small table with her family, creating a particularly warm atmosphere. Unfortunately, all memories have turned into bubbles and will never come back. On the hospital bed, the pale [Yi Yao] slowly opened her eyes, looking around at the unfamiliar surroundings.
0:25:4|0:25:20|Completely forgetting why she was here, in the hospital ward, a nurse was taking care of the patient in the next bed. Looking around, a familiar face appeared before her eyes, it was [Qi Ming] who was patiently guarding by the bedside at that moment.
0:25:20|0:25:29|Yi Yao was already half asleep, propping up his arm. Qi Ming immediately woke up when Yi Yao turned over gently.
0:25:39|0:25:48|[Yi Yao] couldn't decide whether it was good or bad in her heart. The thing she was most worried about was still kept secret.
0:26:59|0:27:15|After saying that, [Qi Ming] got up to pour water, [Yi Yao]'s monologue, [Qi Ming] didn't care at all, while the girls in the KTV were playing games.
0:27:16|0:27:32|[Tang Xiaomi] held a fruit plate, afraid that someone would take it away. In the hospital room, [Qi Ming] was feeding water to [Yi Yao], supporting her to lie down slowly and gently touching her hair. The face of [Yi Yao], who had been half-conscious for a while, finally no longer looked so pale.
0:27:36|0:27:49|[Qi Ming] took out his phone from the pocket of his coat and walked out of the ward, while [Yi Yao] tucked in the blanket and slowly closed her eyes. KTV's [Tang Xiaomi] was already a bit disappointed, playing with the entertainment toys absentmindedly, with a resentful look on her face.
0:27:49|0:27:57|Just then, [Qi Ming] suddenly called, dispelling [Tang Xiaomi]'s displeasure, and greeted sweetly after answering the call.
0:27:59|0:28:5|Like a spoiled child, [Tang Xiaomi] showed off as she arrived at the door.
0:28:12|0:28:22|Saying that, [Tang Xiaomi] walked up to the mirror, checking her outfit beautifully, obviously surprised by what had happened.
0:28:39|0:28:59|[Tang Xiaomi] hung up the phone, feeling a sense of disappointment in her heart. All her expectations were shattered, and her boasting had become a joke. She easily pinned all her dissatisfaction on [Yi Yao], and as she thought about it, a fierce look appeared in her eyes. Determined in her heart, she decided that she must teach [Yi Yao] a lesson.
0:28:59|0:29:6|In the hospital, [Yi Yao] had just woken up. [Qi Ming] gently stroked the back of [Yi Yao]'s hand where she had been injected. [Yi Yao], still heavy-hearted, said
0:29:7|0:29:17|Tears rolled down the corner of her eyes. [Qi Ming] smiled faintly.
0:29:18|0:29:36|[Yi Yao] turned away, not letting [Qi Ming] see her tears, but the sadness was real. Tears kept streaming down [Yi Yao]'s nose, falling on the pillow, while memories crawled into her heart.
0:29:40|0:29:58|In the dream, the amusement park emerges. A family of three is enjoying their holiday on the pirate ship. Grown-up [Yi Yao] stands not far away, gazing tightly at the ordinary family, the tight days are the most beautiful dream in this girl's heart, even after becoming memories, it is still her haven.
0:29:58|0:30:2|Unfortunately, time waits for no one, the past will not come back.
0:30:2|0:30:27|The deserted amusement park is covered with fallen leaves, much like the turmoil in [Yi Yao]'s heart. She stands alone in the dilapidated playground, yearning for family warmth. Under the gloomy sky, she holds herself tightly, as if guarding the last stronghold of her heart. With a poor family background and urgent illness, she is in a state of panic.
0:30:27|0:30:47|The classmates' gazes, all tormenting her youth that should have blossomed, and the greatest pain is the deep sense of powerlessness after seeing the truth, the unsolvable situation, weighing heavily on the girl's heart, particularly heavy. [Qi Ming] is sitting at the dining table, reading a book.
0:30:48|0:31:6|Father walked in, took off his coat, put down his keys and wallet, and headed straight into the house. [Qi Ming] then looked at the wallet on the table by the door, knowing that his father had just received his salary today. [Qi Ming] had a crooked idea in mind.
0:31:17|0:31:35|The father took out his wallet and noticed that some money was missing. He glanced suspiciously at [Qi Ming], but ultimately didn't ask. [Qi Ming] looked guilty and glanced at his father. The next day, in the classroom, [Yi Yao] opened his wallet on his desk, only to find some loose change in the old wallet.
0:31:35|0:31:42|Regrettably, she took out two cans of the only ointment left from the drawer, feeling distressed.
0:32:4|0:32:25|[Qi Ming] came to [Yi Yao] after finishing his homework, gently removing something from the tip of [Yi Yao]'s nose. [Yi Yao] felt puzzled, but this scene was observed closely by [Tang Xiaomi] behind them, filled with resentment and jealousy. It spread on her beautiful face as [Yi Yao] and [Qi Ming] arrived at the garage.
0:32:58|0:33:10|[Yi Yao] threw the money on the ground, got on the car without looking back. [Qi Ming] squatted down helplessly, picking up the money one by one. [Gu Senxiang] walked over at some point, [Qi Ming] looked up and met her gaze, feeling a bit embarrassed as he said:
0:33:44|0:33:57|The gloomy weather had just rained, and on the road, [Yi Yao] rode her bike with a frown, followed not far behind by a girl in a short skirt and long socks, who was [Tang Xiaomi]. [Yi Yao] was heading towards...
0:33:57|0:34:22|Obviously not going home, [Tang Xiaomi] somehow caught up inexplicably. On that day, with red eyes, [Yi Yao] slowly parked the car by the roadside. Across the street was the hospital she had visited before. She looked at the hospital solemnly, but in her heart, she was having second thoughts. After a moment of contemplation, she ultimately decided that her wallet was empty and she had no confidence. So she rode her bike in another direction. She ran to the hospital, but didn't enter and left again, leaving the trailing [Tang Xiaomi] puzzled.
0:34:22|0:34:29|Just as [Tang Xiaomi] caught up by riding her bike again, she saw the classmate who used to bully her before transferring schools.
0:34:39|0:34:45|The dim light reflected on the mottled walls of the alley. [Yi Yao] pushed the cart to the entrance of a run-down clinic.
0:34:45|0:35:1|Facing financial difficulties, [Yi Yao] had no choice but to try her luck in a place like this. Encouraging herself, she gritted her teeth and decided to give it a shot. Parking the car swiftly, she took off her school uniform, turned it inside out, and carried her backpack as she walked inside.
0:35:1|0:35:16|Upon entering, the eyes are greeted by an old corridor, where a middle-aged woman sits busily at a sewing machine. The walls on both sides of the corridor are covered with various strange and peculiar small advertisements. [Yi Yao] hesitated before taking a step upstairs.
0:35:16|0:35:32|On the second floor, there is a window. The glass is pasted with accommodation registration, it looks like an unknown small hotel. Turning around the corridor, the big sister at the hotel front desk is cracking melon seeds. The oppressive environment makes [Yi Yao] feel out of place, and she unconsciously quickens her pace.
0:35:32|0:35:45|Welcoming her was a long corridor, surprisingly quiet with no signs of a clinic. [Yi Yao] felt a bit scared, tightly gripping the straps of her backpack as she walked forward slowly. It didn't take long.
0:35:45|0:36:7|[Yi Yao] quietly approached a door, she looked up at the sign on the door that read "Consulting Room 1" to make sure she was in the right place. She then leaned forward and peeked through the crack in the door. Inside, the room was very messy, with mahjong tiles scattered all over the square table. Next to an old cabinet sat a middle-aged man, with his feet up on the table, reading a newspaper and drinking hot tea.
0:36:7|0:36:22|The other person looked up and saw [Yi Yao]. [Yi Yao] immediately rushed downstairs in a panic, as if she had just been through a fierce battle. In the brief moments, her heart was particularly tormented, and she crouched at the door gasping in fear. Startled, [Yi Yao] stood up at once.
0:36:22|0:36:47|The owner of the phone pressed the shutter button, it was [Tang Xiaomi] who had been chased for several blocks. She also looked at [Yi Yao] vigilantly with red eyes. [Tang Xiaomi] looked at the clinic advertisement on the wall, deliberately dragging out the long vowel sound. A curious look appeared on her smiling face, instantly pushing [Yi Yao] into an abyss. [Yi Yao] blushed, biting her lip.
0:36:47|0:36:56|Tears welled up in her eyes, her body trembling with anger. Soon, tears rolled down her cheeks.
0:37:37|0:37:46|It's a terrifying case of campus bullying. Walking in the school, one would be surrounded, clean school uniform splashed with ink, even during meal times,
0:37:46|0:38:2|Some classmates also poured leftover food into [Yi Yao]'s bowl. The news spread quickly like a virus, and [Yi Yao] was labeled as a carrier of the pathogen. Unreasonable curses, accusations, disdain, and contempt came one after another.
0:38:2|0:38:24|Even walking on the street, [Yi Yao] would still have paper stuck on her back by classmates. All she could do was run desperately, trying to escape from the crowd, from the gossip. Even if she managed to escape downstairs, there would still be a bucket of dirty water pouring down from above, splashing all over her face. Kind-hearted classmates who wanted to help would still be stopped by others.
0:38:24|0:38:42|At night, the wind blows by the river, but memories of school keep coming to mind. The flowers brought by [Qi Ming] in front of the window at home have withered. By the river, [Yi Yao] holds her head in pain, covering her ears in fear and staring into the distance, as if the gossip always finds its way into her ears no matter how far away.
0:38:42|0:38:59|In the small pond in the grassy beach that day floated an old school bag, covered with the scent of autumn, with withered weeds and leaves on top. The pond was filled with impurities, like a pool of dirty water. [Yi Yao] stood in the water,
0:38:59|0:39:7|The cold lake water rose above her chest. The old school bag gently swayed on the surface of the water, lonely in this pond.
0:39:7|0:39:34|Just like [Yi Yao]'s life, he felt powerless. Determined, [Yi Yao] slowly moved forward, every step taken with extreme caution. Stretching out his hand and gritting his teeth, [Yi Yao] took two slow steps forward, almost reaching the backpack. Stretching his neck and extending his hand, he slipped and fell into the water. Suddenly, [Yi Yao] was lifted up from behind by [Gu Senxi], who had arrived.
0:39:34|0:39:41|Tightly holding [Yi Yao], [Qi Ming] dragged [Yi Yao] back to the shore.
0:41:7|0:41:14|[Gu Senxi] looked into the distance in contemplation, while [Yi Yao] waited for his response, then [Yi Yao] angrily walked away.
0:41:30|0:41:47|[Gu Senxi] looked up and saw that [Yi Yao] had already walked far away. So he shouted towards her back, but [Yi Yao] didn't respond. She always felt that this boy talked a lot of nonsense, but the next day, [Yi Yao] still came, and she came to this small grove.
0:41:57|0:42:9|[Gu Senxi] was talking, but his hand kept reaching towards [Yi Yao]'s shoulder. [Yi Yao] kept shaking off his hand time and time again. The two of them sat together under the shade of a tree, nibbling on hot dogs.
0:43:1|0:43:9|[Gu Senxi] dunks on the low basketball hoop, then slaps the ball to scare [Yi Yao]. [Yi Yao] on the swing is startled.
0:43:34|0:43:52|[Gu Senxi] reached out and patted, implying. [Yi Yao] lowered her head somewhat embarrassedly. [Gu Senxi] squatted down, [Yi Yao] immediately stood up, running and saying.
0:43:54|0:44:3|She came to the pool of ocean balls and plunged in headfirst. It was like falling into a colorful rainbow, with various ocean balls enveloping her, and the setting sun shining down.
0:44:3|0:44:24|On her profile, at this moment [Yi Yao] seemed to have found a bit of meaning in life. She slowly closed her eyes, enjoying a moment of quiet away from the crowd. She turned sideways in the ocean ball, slowly curling up her body, tightly hugging her knees and curling towards deeper waters, as layer by layer of the ocean ball was gently pushed aside by a pair of gentle hands.
0:45:20|0:45:25|He wanted to get closer. Sitting by the pool, [Yi Yao] was muttering to herself, trying to push away [Gu Senxi], who gave him a displeased look.
0:45:25|0:45:56|But step by step, [Gu Senxi] squeezed his way to [Yi Yao] from the pile of ocean balls, sat down next to [Yi Yao] with a surprised look. [Gu Senxi] smiled and said, [Yi Yao] was first surprised, then realized that she was a beautiful thing in his eyes. She shyly lowered her head, embarrassedly fiddling with the ocean balls in her hands. [Gu Senxi] also lowered his head, cautiously getting closer to [Yi Yao] with his shoulder, coughed lightly, scared away, full of admiration wanting to get close to [Gu Senxi].
0:46:7|0:46:37|In the classroom, the big-faced girl chewed the gum and stuck it on [Yi Yao]'s hair. After finishing, she happily ran back to her group, where they laughed and gestured as if they had accomplished something great. Hearing their cheerful voices, [Yi Yao] decisively picked up the scissors and cut off that strand of hair. She stood up and fiercely stuck the gum-covered strand of hair on the big-faced girl's bangs. [Yi Yao] who rebelled, shocked them with her actions.
0:46:37|0:46:53|No one expected the usually submissive little lamb to suddenly become so fierce. [Yi Yao] was walking in the corridor when a basketball flew and hit the wall next to a male student's head, which scared him and made him angry.
0:46:54|0:47:10|Yi Yao turned around and saw Gu Senxi picking up the basketball. They exchanged a glance and smirked before walking away. During the physical education class, the whole class practiced volleyball in pairs, but how could Tang Xiaomi's small group miss this opportunity?
0:47:31|0:47:42|Qi Ming looked at Yi Yao in disbelief. Yi Yao stared back at her without any sign of weakness, leaving the small group stunned. Yi Yao then casually continued playing volleyball as if it were just a small matter.
0:47:42|0:47:54|At noon in the cafeteria, [Yi Yao] walked in with her head held high. A male student couldn't avoid her and bumped into another girl, causing the food to spill all over her. However, this commotion attracted more people's attention.
0:48:30|0:48:45|[Yi Yao] chased the boy with a water pipe, even [Tang Xiaomi] and others couldn't dodge it. [Qi Ming] walked over, saw this scene, took the water pipe from [Yi Yao], and faced [Qi Ming]'s questioning.
0:48:47|0:49:7|[Yi Yao] bit her lip in frustration, unsure how to deal with [Qi Ming]. Fortunately, she picked up the water pipe to shut off the faucet. The students watching the commotion followed her, and in front of the faucet was [Gu Senxi]. [Qi Ming] strode forward and threw the water pipe into the pool.
0:49:15|0:49:23|[Gu Senxi] splashed the water from the pipe onto [Qi Ming]'s face, and [Qi Ming] retaliated with a fierce punch. It was during the student council meeting that day.
0:50:40|0:50:56|Gu Senxi pretended to repair the microphone stand, but actually used the circle on top to lock eyes with [Yi Yao] in the crowd. Unconsciously, both of them had smiles on their faces. Last night, Gu Senxi, who was standing outside the door as punishment, was passing by a teacher who said a word to him. At that moment, a scarf was wrapped around his neck.
0:51:22|0:51:44|The brother and sister leaned their heads together, looking at the phone screen. When the teacher finished work and walked over, the sister explained nervously. After she finished, the teacher picked up the briefcase and left. [Gu Senxi] disdainfully glanced at the teacher's back, then turned back to continue using the phone.
0:51:53|0:51:58|The note says that [Yi Yao] is the girlfriend of the younger brother in brackets.
0:52:12|0:52:21|The older sister held up her phone and said, as Big Face Sister walked out of the bathroom, she ran into [Gu Senxiang].
0:52:31|0:52:48|Big Face Sister stopped [Gu Senxiang], who was at a loss. After Big Face Sister left, he handed over the cute sanitary napkin with cartoon patterns that [Yi Yao] had taken.
0:52:55|0:53:2|[Yi Yao]'s expression changed from longing to helplessness. Where would she get so much money from?
0:53:10|0:53:18|[Yi Yao]'s mother was giving a massage at home, and [Yi Yao] walked in on the scene where the old man just raised his head and was pressed back down by his mother.
0:53:26|0:53:33|The man with a fat body sat up and the mother went out to catch up with [Yi Yao].
0:54:8|0:54:31|[Yi Yao] hurriedly took out a few bills from her mother's pocket. Her mother watched her run away, her eyes moist. That day, the school organized a trip to the science museum. As classmates boarded the bus one by one, [Yi Yao] suddenly felt a pain in her stomach by the window. She quickly got off to go to the restroom. Wanting to return to her seat before the bus departed, [Tang Xiaomi] and others saw [Yi Yao] in the distance and came up with a plan.
0:54:32|0:54:50|Seeing [Yi Yao]'s school bag, [Tang Xiaomi] winked at the group. They immediately understood [Tang Xiaomi]'s intention. After some consideration, [Tang Xiaomi] said, "The driver started the car." The small group became even more excited.
0:54:52|0:55:6|A series of buses drove out of the assembly point, and at this moment [Yi Yao] hurried back from the restroom, only to find that the bus had already left. [Yi Yao] stood there dumbfounded, feeling sorrowful inside.
0:55:50|0:56:11|[Gu Senxi] pushed [Yi Yao] onto the bus of their own class, and soon classmates got off the bus and walked towards the science museum in groups with a sense of freshness. [Gu Senxi] proudly said to [Yi Yao], even playing a little trick to make [Yi Yao] happy, and the two of them took the elevator.
0:57:21|0:57:26|Under the sunlight, [Gu Senxiang] walks with a coat on, followed closely by [Qi Ming].
0:57:32|0:57:46|Saying that, [Gu Senxi] took off his hoodie and put it on [Yi Yao]'s head without hesitation. [Qi Ming] and [Gu Senxiang] walked side by side, with [Gu Senxiang] couldn't help but chuckle at his brother's actions. [Yi Yao] was once again caught off guard by the hoodie, feeling at a loss.
0:58:3|0:58:10|[Yi Yao] turned his head without saying a word. [Gu Senxi] stepped in to help him out. [Yi Yao] seemed to see something in this boy.
0:58:10|0:58:29|Seeing hope, [Gu Senxi] walked up to [Qi Ming] and got close to him. Standing on tiptoe, she looked down at her brother disapprovingly and poked him for his offense. However, [Qi Ming] didn't look at him, but instead turned to [Yi Yao]. With lowered brows, [Yi Yao] avoided eye contact, showing nothing but evasion. In the end, she still went along.
0:58:43|0:59:5|[Gu Senxi] pretended to be calm, holding onto the railing with one hand and [Yi Yao]'s shoulder with the other. On the other side, [Qi Ming] held onto the railing with both hands, protecting [Gu Senxiang] in his arms. Due to the violent shaking, [Gu Senxiang] could only bump into his chest. [Qi Ming] solemnly protected [Gu Senxiang] on the bridge, and as the shaking gradually stopped, [Yi Yao] looked across the bridge that had collapsed.
0:59:5|0:59:7|Qi Ming and Yi Yao unexpectedly developed a hint of sweetness between them.
0:59:13|0:59:41|The self-righteous [Gu Senxi] shamelessly held hands with [Yi Yao], who quickly withdrew her hand and looked towards [Qi Ming]. [Gu Senxiang] lowered her head shyly and with concern in her eyes. The classmates chatted as they walked out of the science museum. [Yi Yao] returned to her class's bus, tightly hugging her backpack. Feeling something amiss, she continued searching inside the bag. Classmates gradually returned to the bus, including [Tang Xiaomi] and her small group.
0:59:41|0:59:50|Standing in the aisle, [Yi Yao] opened her wallet, only to find that the money she had just received from her mother was all gone. Angered, [Yi Yao] clenched her wallet tightly.
1:0:7|1:0:12|Xiao Bianzi brought a big bag of cakes.
1:0:58|1:1:4|[Qi Ming] picked up the ointment on the chair, named Youshukang. He glared at [Yi Yao] with resentment, then got off the car.
1:1:19|1:1:31|The waves by the river washed against the giant rocks, the evening breeze blew past, the reeds blew past [Yi Yao]'s slender body, she sat on a rock gazing at the surging river.
1:1:31|1:1:46|Although it was time to leave school, she couldn't go home. A figure in a coat walked over and sat on a nearby rock. [Yi Yao] didn't need to turn around to know that it must be [Qi Ming] who had arrived. [Yi Yao] sat quietly, her eyes gently fixed on the distance.
1:2:11|1:2:31|[Yi Yao] turned his head after speaking, took a deep breath, bit his lip and said, [Qi Ming] continued to ask:
1:2:39|1:2:46|When it came to this, [Yi Yao]'s emotions surged again, and [Qi Ming] didn't want to furrow his brows, so he simply stood up.
1:3:55|1:4:9|[Qi Ming]'s firm rejection left [Yi Yao] speechless, and the attempt of [Yi Yao]'s family to take advantage was easily thwarted.
1:4:13|1:4:27|The fat guy lay on the massage bed and vowed earnestly, shortly after, [Yi Yao] went to take a shower. His mother came to the table, collected 150 yuan and put it in her wallet, zipping it up expressionlessly. Such is life.
1:4:27|1:4:41|She was already tired of it all, and couldn't help but think of her daughter. Thinking of this home, her face turned bitter. A bottle of shampoo was handed out from behind the curtain, and the mother got up to take a look.
1:4:59|1:5:12|That's Yi Yao's towel, under the gloomy sky the river water washes the scattered boulders and dam, Yi Yao stands on a rock looking at Qi Ming across the river.
1:9:25|1:9:54|That day when the mother was not at home, [Yi Yao] took the opportunity to rummage through the boxes and cabinets, making the already untidy home even more chaotic. [Yi Yao] didn't intend to stop, she went under the TV cabinet, searched fruitlessly, then moved to the small wardrobe. Seemingly unable to find the money, unwilling to give up, she even stuffed all the small steel springs into her pocket. She had suffered for too long.
1:9:55|1:10:12|She wanted to experience sweetness once, even if it was just this once. She opened an iron box and found a thick old envelope inside. On the envelope were written five small characters "Yao Yao's tuition fee". [Yi Yao] took out the cash inside, which included 5 yuan, 10 yuan, and 1 yuan, all neatly arranged.
1:10:12|1:10:38|But each one looked old, [Yi Yao] put the money back into the envelope, squeezing it tightly in her hands. How could her annoying mother not love her silently? Tears welled up in her eyes, and [Yi Yao] seemed to lose support in her body, slowly leaning against the cabinet. She realized she was wrong, and at that moment her mother pushed the door open and [Yi Yao] quickly hid the envelope behind her.
1:10:41|1:10:49|The mother snatched the envelope from [Yi Yao]'s hand, looking furious,
1:11:18|1:11:33|The word "towel" made the mother understand the reason, and she looked at the towel belonging to [Yi Yao]. The mother walked back to the chair in a daze, feeling that her retribution had come.
1:11:34|1:11:43|The mother gave herself a loud slap in the face, [Yi Yao] shrank next to the cabinet, not daring to make a sound, while the mother quietly touched her forehead, but her eyes turned red.
1:11:43|1:12:4|At this moment, she finally understood her daughter's abnormal behavior, and all the reasons pointed to herself. After the mother figured it out, she gently came to [Yi Yao]'s side, held her daughter's hand tightly, and this woman, who was not good at expressing herself, was apologizing to her daughter through her actions, tears streaming down [Yi Yao]'s face.
1:12:13|1:12:22|In the surprised eyes of the neighbors, the mother bravely and firmly pulled [Yi Yao] towards the alley, leaving a silhouette that seemed brave enough to defy the whole world.
1:13:26|1:13:41|From then on, [Yi Yao] walked in and out of the campus with her head held high, the cloud over her head completely swept away by her mother. Riding her bike through the underground tunnel, there was only confidence in her expression. The long tunnel was no longer dim, just like her current life.
1:13:41|1:13:55|Returning from the torment of illness to her original life turned out to be so easy and carefree. However, fate seemed unwilling to forgive her easily.
1:14:2|1:14:26|She witnessed the classmates bullying the girl at the corner and walking away. She slowly stopped the car, ready to help the poor girl. However, when the girl raised her head, [Yi Yao] clearly hesitated, while the girl stared in horror with wide eyes. Yes, the girl who was bullied and crying on the ground was [Tang Xiaomi]. [Yi Yao] changed her mind, she just wanted to push the car and leave this place of trouble quickly.
1:15:0|1:15:18|The soft-hearted [Yi Yao] would not be easily frightened. She pushed the cart and walked away quickly, leaving [Tang Xiaomi] staring angrily at her back with tears in her eyes. On a rainy night, [Tang Xiaomi] sat on the bed wrapped in a cute blanket, but was already plotting a vicious plan.
1:15:18|1:15:28|She contacted the social youth on her phone to get the phone number of [Yi Yao], who is [Qi Ming]'s girlfriend and is competing with her for a man.
1:15:28|1:15:45|That afternoon, [Yi Yao] was leaning on the railing of the pedestrian overpass, watching the traffic below. Her phone beeped with a message notification, and she immediately took it out to check. The message read, "Are you [Qi Ming]'s girlfriend?" Just then, [Gu Senxi] walked over and saw.
1:16:12|1:16:22|[Gu Senxi] wrapped an arm around [Yi Yao]'s head, pressing it against his chest. [Yi Yao] tried to resist but failed.
1:16:58|1:17:10|[Yi Yao] tenaciously snatched back the phone and enthusiastically forwarded the message to [Gu Senxiang]. Then she turned back and sneakily glanced, making [Gu Senxi] couldn't help but chuckle.
1:17:10|1:17:29|[Gu Senxiang], waiting for the bus on the side of the road, received a text message. She opened the message sent by [Yi Yao], which read, "Qi Ming asked me to bring you something. Please come to the back of the school to pick it up." Just then, the bus arrived at the stop. A female office worker holding a coffee hurriedly ran over.
1:17:29|1:18:0|The spilled coffee splashed on [Gu Senxiang]'s coat. [Gu Senxiang] comforted herself, took out a finger to wipe the coat, as the night fell quietly. In the evening city with bright lights, on the pedestrian bridge, [Gu Senxiang] wanted to sneak up and hug [Yi Yao] from behind several times, but in the end, just raised a hand and didn't dare to go further. [Qi Ming], who was waiting at the meeting point, received a text message from [Gu Senxiang] with a cute selfie, saying she would be a little late.
1:18:0|1:18:7|You know the reason, [Qi Ming] replied, I have arrived, you don't need to worry, take your time, I'll wait for you.
1:18:7|1:18:30|However, [Gu Senxiang] arrived at the back door of the school but couldn't find [Yi Yao]. The gloomy alley after the rain was obviously not a suitable place for a meeting. [Gu Senxiang] approached and gently pushed open the rusty iron gate, holding her coat tightly in her arms, feeling extremely scared. Even the sound of the iron gate closing startled her. The eerie and terrifying atmosphere was spreading.
1:18:30|1:18:42|She still chose to step in here, out of trust in her classmates. The two of them were busy catching dolls, and [Yi Yao] helped him take out his phone.
1:18:49|1:19:12|The two of them were having a great time playing at the claw machine. [Yi Yao] tried to grab a toy but was dodged by the other person. [Qi Ming] stood by the road holding a gift, waiting foolishly. A group of unexpected visitors arrived at the school gate. Seeing their appearance, [Gu Senxiang] knew something was wrong, so she ran away. She slipped in the muddy ground after running a few steps. Seeing the group chasing after her, [Gu Senxiang] knew deeply.
1:19:12|1:19:22|Misfortune seemed to outweigh fortune as [Qi Ming] could only run towards this dilapidated building. At a critical moment, the phone unexpectedly fell off the building and was then stepped on by a hooligan.
1:19:24|1:19:36|In the game hall, the two of them were having a great time, while [Qi Ming] on the street couldn't wait any longer. [Gu Senxiang], who rushed out of the road, ran wildly in the old corridor. As a good student, when has she ever seen such a scene, she panicked.
1:19:36|1:20:4|In the midst of the rush, she dropped her backpack off her shoulders and almost crawled up to the rooftop. With disheveled hair, she ran clumsily on the rooftop, almost stumbling. In the distance, thunder rumbled in the sky. On the empty rooftop, the lonely [Gu Senxiang] anxiously looked around. The sound of steel pipes scraping the ground came from nearby. [Gu Senxiang] was both anxious and panicked, but could only step back one by one, trying to stay away from the gang of thugs who were getting closer step by step.
1:20:4|1:20:30|Step by step, she retreated, not even knowing that she had reached a point of no return. The sound of the steel pipe rubbing grew closer and closer, [Gu Senxiang] felt both wronged and scared, with only one thought in mind - to get away from these villains. Three figures surrounded her, [Gu Senxiang] shrank back in fear, but little did she know that the rusty railing, long neglected, would break upon impact. Meanwhile, [Tang Xiaomi] lay on the bed in the bedroom, wearing headphones and leisurely picking at her nails.
1:20:30|1:20:50|It seems that everything tonight was within her expectations. She picked up her phone to check the message, only to find out that the other party was threatening her with self-harm. If she falls, it's none of our business. [Tang Xiaomi] panicked, knowing that she was the one who started all this.
1:20:50|1:21:20|The ambulance lights were flashing, the mother of the girl who fell has already collapsed in the hospital. [Gu Senxi] and her father barely held the mother, while [Yi Yao] with tears on her face, stood blankly in the police station lobby. Seeing a family of four become three, when she walked over, [Yi Yao] stood in place and cried uncontrollably, [Gu Senxi] couldn't comfort her.
1:21:21|1:21:33|In the past, [Yi Yao] and [Gu Senxiang] had almost no interaction. The only time they met was when he borrowed a sanitary pad for his younger brother, bringing the girl closer to her sister, bridging the distance between them time and time again.
1:21:33|1:21:52|[Gu Senxi] felt extremely guilty, but couldn't face the gaze of [Yi Yao]. Tears filled [Yi Yao]'s face, just as her newly risen life plunged into darkness. When [Qi Ming] walked out, he didn't even look at the pitiful [Yi Yao]. [Yi Yao] clenched the straps of her backpack, with a pained expression and twisted features.
1:22:31|1:22:47|From the unbearable pain to the calmness of the heart, how long does it take? Thinking back to the beginning, it was a scented sanitary napkin that connected the relationship between the two through the door panel. There was not much opportunity to get to know each other. The accident took away her youth, and she had to close her eyes and stop thinking about these things.
1:22:47|1:22:55|While the people around her kept reminding her, [Yi Yao] was kneeling on the rooftop, scrubbing the floor in the rain, soaking her clothes.
1:23:29|1:23:49|[Yi Yao] knelt in the rain, covered with graffiti all over the ground, the vicious words particularly piercing. Her wet hair stuck to her face, and [Yi Yao] could only cry to the sky. The bean-sized raindrops hit her face, resembling those rumors that were everywhere and nowhere to hide.
1:23:49|1:24:2|In the police station, [Yi Yao] looked desolate and moving, with a hint of tears in her eyes, yet no sign of anger. She slowly closed her eyes, leaving behind the last tear.
1:24:7|1:24:26|The sky was particularly gloomy and oppressive, [Yi Yao] stood on the stone-paved dam, the cold wind stung her thin knitted sweater, scattered her hair in the muddy river water, and slapped the snowy dam, as if sobbing something, the wind passed through the reeds, as if whispering something.
1:24:42|1:24:50|They were just curious, not concerned. [Qi Ming] walked against the crowd, expressionless, while [Gu Senxi] was also immersed in sadness.
1:24:52|1:25:5|Students ran in groups, passing by [Gu Senxi] without a glance, as the river water washed against the embankment wave after wave, much like the endless stream of malicious words.
1:25:26|1:25:41|Until the words reached Qi Ming's ears, he suddenly widened his eyes, gritted his teeth, and ran towards the riverbank.
1:25:57|1:26:10|On the river bank, three rows of spectators stood, with hundreds of mouths ready to drown Yi Yao in saliva. Qi Ming walked slowly towards them, while Gu Senxi emerged from the crowd.
1:26:29|1:26:34|Only [Gu Senxi] is willing to stand in front of everyone, standing in front of public opinion.
1:29:5|1:29:25|The mottled figure on the wide river surface, running lower than the ground, was blocked by classmates [Qi Ming], [Gu Senxi] had already rushed towards [Yi Yao], the figure running away.
1:29:25|1:29:43|Seemingly declaring war on the last justice in this world, even if alone, even against the surging river, unafraid of being broken into pieces, the soul of [Yi Yao] is fearless, wanting to keep innocence in the world. All the onlookers are dumbfounded as [Yi Yao] jumps into the river in full view of everyone.
1:29:57|1:30:7|[Yi Yao] sinks in the river, and a hand suddenly reaches out and grabs [Yi Yao]'s arm.
1:31:1|1:31:13|[Gu Senxi] lying unconscious on the side in agony, can [Yi Yao] wake up, is there still a chance to salvage all this? Time flies like an arrow, never stopping day or night.
1:32:51|1:32:59|[Yi Yao]'s mother took the cash handed to her by the scrap collector and walked calmly into the house.
1:33:3|1:33:15|[Gu Senxi] transferred to the new campus and kept to himself. After a moment of contemplation, he spoke:
1:33:32|1:33:47|[Yi Yao] stood on the small round platform in the center of the pond, mimicking [Gu Senxi]'s gesture of forming a circle with her hand, looking through the circle at a beam of sunlight.
