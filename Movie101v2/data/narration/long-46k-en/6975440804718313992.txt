0:1:34|0:1:39|At this moment, [Li Yan] was frantically wiping sweat in front of the mirror, then opened her mouth to turn on the electric fan.
0:1:57|0:2:14|The scene shifts, [Driver Hua] is sitting in the driver's seat listening to the singer ICE passing through a crowd of crazy fans. As he opens the car door and sits in, he hears [Driver Hua] playing music. ICE immediately orders him not to touch the radio randomly. [Driver Hua] immediately changes the music to HIP-HOP genre and nods his head to the beat.
0:2:43|0:3:2|At the beach, Uncle A Wei is squatting with a parasol, and the camera cuts back to the convenience store where Xiao Fang is knocking on an ice cream with a popsicle.
0:3:7|0:3:15|[Xiao Qi] happily rode her bicycle into the factory after listening, while [Xiao Fang] looked at her with a sense of longing. At that moment, a person in high heels raised the rolling shutter door.
0:4:15|0:4:30|The TV is showing a news report, with [A Wei] drinking from a newly opened can of beer while propping up the TV hanging on the wall. At that moment, two people in swimsuits run past the camera. The scene then shifts to outside [A Wei]'s house.
0:4:30|0:4:38|This is a vast beach, with the sea just a stone's throw away. In the scorching summer days, our movie "City of Love" has officially begun.
0:4:41|0:4:54|In contrast to Hong Kong just now, we are now in the bustling metropolis of Shenzhen. [Li Yan] is sitting in front of a piano playing a piece. As the piece ends, she folds her hands with satisfaction. The man beside her can't help but applaud.
0:5:20|0:5:40|[Li Yan] gave the boss a slap and walked out. As she left the company, she wiped her face and noticed it was dirty. She happened to pass by a foot massage parlor and saw a mirror on the counter. [Li Yan] went up to clean her face and unexpectedly noticed a recruitment ad next to it. It stated that the shop was currently in need of male and female foot masseurs and bone-setting therapists, with a monthly salary ranging from 2000 to 4500.
0:5:40|0:5:43|Li Yan walks into the store after watching.
0:5:50|0:6:5|[Li Yan] finished speaking and smiled foolishly at the boss lady, her eyes wide open, looking very sincere. The boss lady looked her up and down, and said to her, "After you finish, hang the sign of number 98 on the wooden board behind you." [Li Yan] looked at the hung wooden board, dumbly thanked and said.
0:6:7|0:6:14|At this moment, the camera cuts to outside a convenience store in Zhenjiang City, where [Xiao Fang] is playing chess with the shop owner.
0:7:0|0:7:9|[Xiao Fang] suddenly stood up, took out a popsicle from the freezer, and ran out to stop the cyclist [Xiao Qi].
0:7:46|0:8:22|[Xiao Qi] smiled and rode into the factory on her bike with an ice cream in hand. [Xiao Fang] watched her and shouted loudly, "At twelve noon on the first day, the factory bell rang." [Li Yan] stopped the doll filling machine and shouted to her coworkers, "Colleagues, let's go outside happily." [Xiao Fang] clapped his hands, looked at [Xiao Qi] who hadn't left yet, called out to her, and suddenly noticed a person outside the window.
0:8:31|0:9:9|Then immediately turned back to look out the window, at this moment [Xiao Fang] stood up straight and started playing with a yo-yo, [Xiao Qi] wiped her hand on her waist and then turned back to look out the window again. When [Xiao Fang] saw [Xiao Qi] looking at her, she immediately raised her right hand and waved at her. [Xiao Qi] saw this and quickly turned her head back, then smiled foolishly. After that, she picked up a glass bottle, put something small inside, and screwed on the lid. After tightening it, she held the bottle in her hands and turned it around.
0:9:9|0:9:23|Then gently placed on the table, the camera zooms in, revealing that the plastic eyes in the bottle belong to a doll. The scene then shifts to the city at night, where several women in uniforms are giving massages to customers. The woman closest to the camera is massaging the feet.
0:9:23|0:9:31|The camera zooms in, revealing that she is [Li Yan]. After the massage, [Li Yan] wearily carries the wooden basin to the rooftop.
0:9:32|0:9:49|[Li Yan] smiled at her colleague, walked to the shelf and bent down to put down the wooden basin. While hanging the blanket, she noticed a blister on her finger. [Li Yan] blew on her finger and quickly hugged the wooden basin as she crawled out from under the shelf.
0:9:49|0:9:54|The scene shifts to Hong Kong, with [Driver Hua] driving [Leslie Guan] on the road when suddenly the car comes to a stop.
0:10:7|0:10:23|[Leslie Guan] immediately asked him to get out of the car and take a look after hearing that, [Driver Hua] opened the hood of the car, and instantly smoke covered the lens. Under the scorching sun, [Driver Hua] was sweating all over his face, and his clothes under the armpits and chest were also wet. In this way, he passed out.
0:10:23|0:10:44|After waking up in the hospital bed, [Driver Hua] picked up his phone and checked it. Meanwhile, [Li Yan], who had also fainted, was receiving an IV drip on a chair. Just now, her phone had rung, and after taking it out, she saw a text message that read: "Heatstroke is nothing to worry about." She pouted upon reading this, picked up her phone, and pressed a few buttons.
0:10:58|0:11:3|Li Yan typed each word of this passage into a text message, and then sent it to the other party again.
0:11:4|0:11:13|[Driver Hua] is very puzzled about being called a conductor. He sends another text to ask the other person, "Who are you?"
0:11:22|0:11:31|Seeing that the other party didn't recognize him, [Driver Hua] quickly flipped through his phone contacts, then immediately sent a text message to apologize to [Li Yan], saying he had dialed the wrong number.
0:11:41|0:11:51|[Li Yan] quickly apologized to the patients in the ward after sending the text message. Seeing Li Yan's reply, [Driver Hua], who had been scolded for the wrong message, awkwardly pulled up the blanket on the bed and fell asleep.
0:11:51|0:12:1|At this moment, [Li Yan] sat up and looked around at the other patients, realizing they were all sound asleep. She leaned back and propped her feet up on a stool.
0:12:1|0:12:16|After shaking her phone, she looked up at the IV bag, then picked up her phone again. Driver Hua's phone rang, he picked it up and saw that it was Li Yan sending a message to Driver Hua.
0:12:17|0:12:25|[Driver Hua] replied to her, "Didn't you just say that sending international text messages is expensive?" [Li Yan] thought for a moment, then sat up and replied word by word:
0:12:32|0:12:37|Driver Hua replied that he certainly has dreams, and then asked Li Yan what she does and why she got heatstroke.
0:13:4|0:13:19|After some thought, he changed back to being a Ferrari driver. [Li Yan] smiled when she saw the text message, leaning back in her chair as she spoke.
0:13:19|0:13:42|Li Yan smiled, raised her own question, then wiped the phone screen on her collar after sending it, took a breath towards the screen, wiped the screen again, and sweetly fell asleep leaning on the chair. At this moment, the camera shifted to nighttime in Hong Kong.
0:14:21|0:14:47|At this moment, the sushi chef placed the sushi in front of [Wasabi]. She shyly smiled, and the sushi chef awkwardly looked towards the side of [Wasabi].
0:15:1|0:15:25|Then slowly clearing the dining table, [Wasabi] started eating sushi. She chewed it in her mouth, tears filling her eyes. After swallowing the sushi slowly, she lowered her head, eyes darting around. Seeing this scene, the sushi chef quickly asked, [Wasabi] took a deep breath, smiled, and said to the sushi chef:
0:15:27|0:15:35|She kept talking while staring at Sushi Chef with her eyes fixed on him. The Sushi Chef quickly lowered his head after listening.
0:16:36|0:16:43|[Wasabi] knocked over the ceramic cup next to his hand, causing the sushi chef to quickly walk over from the opposite side of the dining table to stand beside [Wasabi].
0:16:49|0:17:8|Seeing [Wasabi] splash water on the sushi chef's face, Fish regretfully said, "The scene shifts to a high-rise building, where [Wasabi] sits by the window scratching her head with a ballpoint pen. Her expression looks very sad, as if she is about to burst into tears in the next second."
0:17:8|0:17:26|She took a deep breath and wrote in her notebook. After finishing the last stroke, the pen ran out of ink. She continued to vent on the notebook. On the other side, the sushi chef kept practicing his knife skills, looking very serious. He threw down the knife and stared straight ahead.
0:18:35|0:19:1|Yuan Yuan, the model who had walked to the door, heard this and stared at [Leslie Guan] with tears in her eyes. The next morning, [Leslie Guan] said in a panic: sitting on the edge of the bed, he kept groping in the air with both hands, then raised his right hand to rub his eyes hard, and finally stretched both hands in front of him. He found everything in front of him blurry, only able to see a faint light. After falling onto the bed, he said:
0:19:3|0:19:9|He then fumbled to pick up a cup of water and used his hand to dab it onto his own eyes.
0:19:16|0:19:24|[Doctor] picked up a magazine excitedly and said:
0:20:4|0:20:12|After saying this, [Driver Hua] put a pair of earplugs into his ears.
0:20:24|0:20:45|Li Yan threw her phone onto the sofa after listening, but quickly crossed over to check a text message. Seeing it was from a Ferrari driver, she happily replied while leaning on the sofa back. Meanwhile, Driver Hua's phone rang while he was driving. He picked it up and realized that these two were still in contact, mentioning they were test driving.
0:20:49|0:21:3|The sushi chef ignored it and continued to make sushi for the customers in the restaurant. After finishing, he placed the food in front of the customers. As he was about to answer the phone, he heard the customers talking, so he put the phone down again.
0:22:3|0:22:28|Sushi master crouched under the dining table, listening as [Wasabi] spoke blankly. After hearing his message, the sushi master pressed the end button, looked down at his phone, and immediately made a call, which turned out to be to [Wasabi]. Just as [Wasabi] was about to answer the call, a car suddenly crashed into them. The person driving and texting at the same time was [Driver Hua].
0:22:28|0:22:36|Fortunately, the car accident was not serious, just the front of the car and the door collided. Meanwhile, on the other side of Hong Kong,
0:22:54|0:23:13|A Wei, who was fixing something, took the pink air conditioner. At the side of the street at night, A Wei started his small motorcycle, wearing a helmet. As another motorcycle passed by and splashed him with water without apologizing, A Wei quickly rode his motorcycle to chase after them. The two motorcycles then weaved through the narrow alleyways.
0:23:13|0:23:34|Soon, the motorcycle in front accelerated and turned into a small alley. [A Wei] on a small motorcycle could only barely keep up. After passing another intersection, the motorcycle in front turned left. [A Wei], who was catching up slowly, could only randomly guess a direction and turned right. After driving for a distance, he stopped his progress. Through the helmet, he seemed to hear the sound of the motorcycle's engine.
0:23:34|0:23:54|So he quickly untied the straps of his helmet and closed his eyes to listen carefully. After roughly determining the direction, [A Wei] immediately drove forward. However, he didn't judge accurately and saw the motorcycle passing by him on the other side of a small road. So he quickly turned around and rushed down the street, continuing to chase the motorcycle right behind it.
0:23:54|0:24:15|At this moment, the owner of the motorcycle, [Ding Dang], stopped and took off the helmet. When [A Wei] caught up and found out that [Ding Dang] was a girl, he suddenly fell silent. After seeing [Ding Dang] leave, he quickly stopped the motorcycle, but it didn't stop properly and fell directly to the ground. [A Wei] glanced at the helmet on the ground and chased after [Ding Dang].
0:24:21|0:24:33|After handing the motorcycle key from around her neck to [A Wei], she took step by step across the beach and into the sea. As the water gradually rose above her thighs, [Ding Dang] dove in, officially starting the swim.
0:24:33|0:25:6|Under the cover of night, she stretched her body in the sea, her delicate limbs forcefully pushing through the water. Changing her posture, she alternated clapping the water with her hands, slowly swimming forward. Bubbles were left behind where she swam. After finishing, [Ding Dang] showered on the beach. [A Wei] leaned against the wall with his back to [Ding Dang] and said, "[Ding Dang]," but she ignored him. After wiping his arms a few times and shaking his hands, [Ding Dang] took her own short-sleeved shirt from [A Wei].
0:25:6|0:25:27|Then, as she put on her short sleeves, she turned to look at [A Wei], grabbed her keys and left. Later, the two of them sat side by side on their motorcycles, with [Ding Dang] putting on her helmet and glancing back at [A Wei]'s bike.
0:25:38|0:25:53|[Ding Dang] lifted the car and revved the engine, quickly drove off after putting down the helmet visor. [A Wei], originally confident he could catch up, didn't expect his motorcycle suddenly wouldn't start. Frustrated, he made a choking gesture towards the direction [Ding Dang] left.
0:25:53|0:26:1|Leaving the beach, [Ding Dang] stopped his motorcycle at the hospital entrance.
0:26:19|0:26:41|[Ding Dang] held the hand of the little girl, smiled and tried to talk to her, but the little girl didn't respond. Instead, she gently closed her eyes, listening to her soft breathing. [Ding Dang] then took her small hand and placed it near his mouth, tenderly kissed it.
0:26:41|0:26:54|Suddenly feeling something in the left front, [Ding Dang] looked up with teary eyes and saw a butterfly flying outside the window. The camera then shifted to [Xiao Fang].
0:27:2|0:27:8|The young man looked at the sun, then reached out to ask for money from [Xiao Fang]. With a look of disdain, [Xiao Fang] took out money from his shoe and handed it over, then put a straw hat on the other person's head.
0:27:13|0:27:19|The young man hurried away after listening. [Xiao Fang] leaned against a small tree, and the factory's break bell rang.
0:27:23|0:27:41|[Xiao Qi] carefully counts the plastic eyeballs in the glass bottle, then looks back at the window. The young man with a straw hat covering his face stands under the sun. [Xiao Qi] throws another plastic eyeball into the bottle, while [Xiao Fang] sits behind the young man, drinking iced soda and watching him.
0:28:20|0:28:33|[Leslie Guan] and [Da Fu] met the landlord, and when they arrived at the small room in Beijing where Yuan Yuan lived, [Da Fu] finished speaking and found a magazine on the table, then hurriedly held it up to [Leslie Guan].
0:28:47|0:28:53|Leslie Guan quickly pulled his hand back, looking very scared on the door frame. Fish asked Fish Girl.
0:29:52|0:30:20|Hearing the short-haired apprentice scold himself, the sushi master lowered his head. At this moment, [Wasabi]'s phone rang. She, lying in the bathtub, glanced at the caller ID, happily blew the bubbles on her body, and ignored it. It turned out to be the sushi master calling, but seeing no one answering, he hung up. [Wasabi] muttered to herself:
0:30:21|0:30:36|She tore off three sticky notes and stuck them on the window, which was already surrounded by a dozen stickers in the shape of a heart. The scene then shifted to a six-story residential building, where Driver Hua's daughter Strawberry asked him if he could come to watch her recitation competition in the afternoon.
0:30:41|0:30:51|Strawberry complained when she heard, "Why is it always like this?" Then [Driver Hua] explained to her that he had to go make money. Strawberry walked discontentedly from the sofa towards [Driver Hua].
0:31:0|0:31:13|Driver Hua said a few words, and Strawberry picked up her backpack and walked towards the door. Halfway there, she turned back to her father and said, "Without looking back, she opened the door and walked out."
0:31:13|0:31:35|After watching Strawberry leave, [Driver Hua] turned to look at the wall and shelf on his left, where there were piano awards certificates won by Strawberry. On the other side, [Li Yan] closed her eyes and blissfully massaged a customer's feet. She quickly apologized and then forcefully pulled the customer's toes.
0:31:35|0:31:52|The scene shifts, and [Xiao Fang] brings over a mannequin the same height as himself, dresses it in clothes matching his own, leans it against a big tree, puts his straw hat on it, then looks back, quickly hides behind the tree, sits down against the trunk, and lets out a long sigh.
0:31:52|0:32:3|At this moment, [Xiao Qi] was carrying the finished doll and walking down the aisle of the factory. When she saw someone, she leaned against a big tree, stood straight, smiled secretly, and suddenly fell down sideways.
0:32:3|0:32:15|Xiao Qi happened to fall at the door, and Xiao Fang, who woke up instantly, immediately went forward to bury the broken dummy with soil. Noticing movement by the big tree, Xiao Qi immediately ran over with the doll in hand.
0:32:30|0:32:43|[Xiao Fang] leaned [Xiao Qi] against a big tree, then kicked away the fake head. Suddenly, [Xiao Fang] saw the fake hand behind [Xiao Qi].
0:32:54|0:33:5|After [Xiao Qi] finished speaking, she handed the doll to [Xiao Fang] with her eyes closed, realizing she had handed the wrong thing, so [Xiao Qi] used her other hand to give the correct item to the other person.
0:33:6|0:33:15|Xiao Fang looked down and saw a bottle of cooling oil in his palm, while Xiao Qi quickly ran into the factory after handing over the cooling oil. The scene shifted.
0:33:18|0:33:25|[Ding Dang] asked the tattoo artist, who put down the machine and said:
0:33:37|0:33:56|The tattoo artist lit a cigarette and smiled, saying, "[Ding Dang], after hearing, gestured for her to come forward. [Ding Dang] ignored the tattoo artist's words and instead blew on the freshly inked design."
0:34:10|0:34:32|[Ding Dang] continued to blow his tattoo, smiled without answering. At this moment on the streets of Hong Kong, [Ding Dang] walked over with a popsicle, while [Driver Hua] kept shouting about his unbeatable shaved ice, claiming that the straws were automatically disinfected and everyone could taste it for free.
0:34:33|0:34:38|This invincible smoothie is very eye-catching, with only the head and limbs of [Driver Hua] showing through it.
0:34:48|0:34:55|Therefore, the crowd blocked the street, and the young man walked up to [Xiao Fang] excitedly and said:
0:34:59|0:35:22|[Xiao Qi] was holding a doll, and when she heard a whistle, she saw [Xiao Fang] sitting on the opposite rooftop. She stopped, chuckled quietly, then continued walking outside with the doll. Under the scorching sun, [Xiao Fang], [Li Yan], Leslie Guan, Driver Hua, [Ding Dang], [Wasabi], [Xiao Qi], [A Wei], and others were all deeply in love.
0:36:2|0:36:8|The beach in Hong Kong is crowded with people seeking relief from the heat.
0:36:35|0:36:43|A man and a woman doubled over with laughter at A Wei's joke, while men and women in hot outfits were partying in the middle of the ocean.
0:37:8|0:37:22|Upon hearing the mechanic's suggestion, [A Wei] lay in a bathtub filled with ice cubes to sell himself, placing a computer on top of the tub. He held his breath and submerged himself in the water, but couldn't hold it and sat up suddenly. He was startled to see someone actually willing to pay to rent him, causing him to quickly spit out an ice cube.
0:37:22|0:37:31|At this point, the prices online were still climbing steadily. [A Wei] not only posted his own photo on the internet, but also titled it "Hunky Man Fixes Air Conditioning".
0:38:25|0:38:43|[A Wei] took a sip of his drink, listened intently, and then the scene switched to [Ding Dang] arriving at the entrance of Weixin Air Conditioning on a motorcycle. [A Wei] pulled up next to her and said:
0:38:49|0:39:11|After [A Wei] finished modifying the motorcycle, he turned on the tail light. Then the two of them rode the motorcycles to the bridge together. [Ding Dang]'s motorcycle was obviously more professional and naturally took the lead, but [A Wei]'s small motorcycle, which had been modified, was not far behind. He kept changing directions in an attempt to overtake [Ding Dang] in front.
0:39:11|0:39:21|Suddenly he twisted the throttle and pressed the nitrous switch, instantly surpassing Ding Dang. Seeing himself in the lead, A Wei glanced back triumphantly, then gestured towards his rear end with a Yeah.
0:39:21|0:39:30|[Ding Dang] naturally got angry and roared forward, and then the two stopped by a staircase.
0:39:41|0:39:55|Seeing [A Wei] leaning next to her, [Ding Dang] asked him angrily. [A Wei] pointed to his small motorcycle. [Ding Dang] turned around and slowly walked up the steps after speaking.
0:39:57|0:40:6|At the same time, bustling Beijing is shrouded in the late night, with vehicles coming and going on the road. [Leslie Guan] and [Da Fu] are discussing.
0:40:17|0:40:23|At this moment, [Leslie Guan] accidentally poked the cigarette butt into the cotton sofa armrest, and soon the armrest was ignited.
0:40:28|0:40:36|[Da Fu] hurriedly pulled him from the sofa into the living room.
0:40:44|0:40:55|Da Fu immediately ran towards the depths of the room. Upon reaching the bedroom, he covered his mouth and walked to the position of the desk. Upon seeing the wallet on top, he immediately picked it up and turned to run.
0:41:13|0:41:22|[Driver Hua] saw Strawberry leaving in a hurry and shouted loudly, but Strawberry ignored him. [Driver Hua] sat on the sofa angrily flipping through the newspaper, while Strawberry sat by the window doing homework.
0:41:39|0:41:47|After receiving a negative answer, Driver Hua said he earns fifty bucks an hour. Strawberry moved her fingers and asked if she could get thirty bucks. Driver Hua listened and then smirked.
0:42:0|0:42:12|Strawberry immediately got up from the window and returned to her room, closing the door behind her. After thinking for a while, [Driver Hua] walked to the door of Strawberry's room, took a deep breath, took out his wallet from his pocket, pulled out thirty dollars, and stuffed it through the crack in the door.
0:42:12|0:42:30|Early the next morning, [Driver Hua] woke up from the sound of the door closing, sweating profusely. He looked towards the door, then slowly propped himself up with his elbow. Turning towards the window, in a daze he saw something, and quickly sat up, [Driver Hua] brought it over.
0:42:42|0:43:0|[Ding Dang] came to the front of Wei Xin Air Conditioning and said to [A Wei]: [Ding Dang] had to put the bank card back into the pocket, then put his hands together.
0:43:12|0:43:24|It turned out that it was [Ding Dang] who threw the helmet on [A Wei], and then [Ding Dang] pointed to the ground. So [A Wei] picked up the helmet and walked to her, then sat on his own small motorcycle.
0:43:54|0:44:7|Seeing the grandmother reaching out her hand, [Ding Dang] signaled [A Wei] to quickly bend down and hug her. After being embraced by the grandmother around the neck, [A Wei] slowly supported her arms with his hands and looked up to see her eyes that were difficult to open.
0:44:7|0:44:15|Sweating profusely, he kept comforting the other person. At night, boats were shuttling back and forth on Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong.
0:44:15|0:44:38|The departure of a grandmother seems insignificant to this city, and then the scene shifts to [A Wei] standing behind [Ding Dang], watching her smile gently. After being kissed on the forehead, [Ding Dang] slaps [A Wei].
0:44:54|0:45:14|[Ding Dang] listened, turned around to look at [A Wei] standing next to her, he smiled at her and took a step forward. Seeing him staring at her lips, [Ding Dang] blinked, then her gaze also landed on [A Wei]'s lips. On the window of [Wasabi]'s house, stars made of sticky notes were almost filled up, only three more to go.
0:45:25|0:45:56|[Li Yan] answered with a fan in her hand: Due to being too excited, she hit her head on the upper bunk bed, then she danced around in the rental room in celebration. After changing into a dress, [Li Yan] ran to the interview hall, apologized to the three interviewers, quickly sat in front of the piano, adjusted her breathing, and started playing with a smile on her face.
0:45:56|0:46:3|The beautiful and agile sound of the piano flows from her fingertips, as comfortable and soothing as a slowly flowing stream.
0:46:3|0:46:23|At this moment, it seems as if we can see two butterflies playing joyfully. Under the sunlight, they flutter their wings, chasing each other, occasionally hiding among the flowers, and sometimes bumping into the petals, even scattering pollen on the ground.
0:46:23|0:46:44|Suddenly, [Li Yan]'s hand stopped responding. There was a large blister on the knuckle of her left index finger, the pain making her unable to exert any force. After pressing the piano keys hard twice, she trembled as she withdrew her hands from the piano, turned around to apologize, then glanced at the piano in front of her again. She walked down the steps with her bag and left the audition room.
0:46:47|0:47:0|[Driver Hua] was selling smoothies while texting, welcoming passengers onto the bus. When [Li Yan]'s phone rang, she opened it to see a message from [Driver Hua] asking if her performance was successful. Touched by this concern, [Li Yan] couldn't help but cry in frustration.
0:47:1|0:47:28|The passenger sitting next to her noticed that [Li Yan] was crying again. [Driver Hua] turned to the people around and said, then took out his phone to reply to [Li Yan]. At this moment, [Li Yan] kept wiping her tears with tissues. The phone rang, and [Driver Hua] said, "Mozart had a difficult life, but he remained optimistic. So, a small setback is not a big deal for [Li Yan]. I believe she will overcome it and just need to keep going in the future."
0:47:28|0:47:38|Li Yan smiled when she saw this, looked at the message, then gazed at the sky. She slowly held back her tears. Meanwhile, Wasabi sat by the window.
0:47:49|0:48:7|[Wasabi] lowered her head and wrote another sticky note, then stuck it on the glass window. At this moment, she was begging with her phone held up.
0:49:32|0:49:41|After listening to [Leslie Guan], he turned around and stared at the ceiling with his blurry eyes, tears swirling in his eyes. At this moment, [Driver Hua] and his bald friend walked into the foot massage parlor.
0:50:4|0:50:32|Driver Hua said he was not willing to come out as he was quite senior. At this moment, two masseuses walked in. Li Yan stood next to the bald guy and put down a basin on the opposite side, saying, "Li Yan" seemed to be very happy next to the female masseuse. The bald friend quickly asked to switch seats with Driver Hua, so Li Yan sat down across from Driver Hua.
0:51:34|0:51:45|Li Yan didn't pay attention to her pronunciation being corrected, Driver Hua picked up the phone next to him and tapped a few times. It turned out to be sent to Li Yan.
0:51:49|0:51:58|Li Yan smiled as she pressed Driver Hua's leg hard. He was in pain, holding his phone in front of his chest and calling out in agony.
0:52:0|0:52:8|In the cafeteria, Li Yan called out to [Xiao Qi], who quietly pushed open the door and walked in. Then Xiao Xin walked up to the boss.
0:52:16|0:52:25|The scene shifts, [Xiao Qi] is on the phone with her mom, assuring her that she will send money back home tomorrow and not to worry. When her mom mentions her boss, Xiao Qi says she knows he likes her a lot, but before she can say much, her mom hints at something.
0:52:33|0:52:50|The next morning, [Xiao Qi] rode past the convenience store on her bike. When [Xiao Fang] came out to greet her, she ignored him and rode into the factory with a frown on her face. [Xiao Fang] looked at her departing figure with a puzzled expression.
0:52:50|0:53:19|On the other side, Strawberry walked out of the room holding a doll, [Driver Hua] sat on the sofa with a phone asking about the story of Mozart's Sonata No. 545, [Li Yan] answered: [Li Yan] was eating rice noodles at a stall while looking at the phone, [Driver Hua] replied: because of his daughter, [Li Yan] put down the chopsticks, angrily typed a reply with both hands.
0:53:20|0:53:33|Driver Hua lay on the sofa, writing earnestly that his wife ran away with someone else a year ago. Li Yan finished reading and excitedly slammed the table, then smiled and wrote another line.
0:53:34|0:53:48|Driver Hua didn't pay attention to it, but said that Strawberry used to love playing the piano very much and was very talented, but she hasn't been willing to play the piano since her mother left. Li Yan didn't say anything immediately after receiving this reply.
0:54:32|0:54:48|[A Wei] went from house to house asking with a light bulb in hand. After listening, [A Wei] quickly stuffed the handkerchief into his shirt pocket. He took the light bulb out of the packaging box and examined it carefully, then shook it next to his ear.
0:54:48|0:54:58|After listening to the voice, he quickly took out money from his pocket and handed it to the boss. Walking on the street, he kept looking at this light bulb, suddenly he bumped into [A Wei].
0:55:19|0:55:31|Slapped [A Wei] in the face, the newly bought light bulb accidentally shattered on the ground. Looking at the broken bulb on the ground, and then at [A Wei], sighed and left. [A Wei] still maintained a defensive posture.
0:55:31|0:55:50|After seeing [A Wei] leave, he first looked at his back, then glanced at the broken light bulb on the ground. Among the passing crowd, he squatted down, picked up the metal shell of the light bulb from the ground, frowned and examined it carefully, while Xiao Li handed a box to Xiao Qi.
0:55:53|0:56:9|In the canteen, Xiao Qi held a meal in one hand and a gift in the other. Xiao Qi opened the back door of the car and got in.
0:56:17|0:56:35|A colleague from the factory walked past the car with a bicycle, [Xiao Qi] quickly lowered her head. Then the car drove out of the factory gate, and Xiao Fang, who was sitting at the door holding a cake, stood up and threw the cake towards the back of the car. [Xiao Qi] did not look back when she heard it, but instead widened her eyes, feeling at a loss, and lowered her head.
0:56:35|0:56:51|The beautifully packaged cake fell to the ground. At night, Xiao Fang, sweating, held a welding mask, not knowing what he was welding. The camera zoomed in, revealing that he was attaching a luxury car emblem to the front of a bicycle. When the boss was awakened by the noise and looked at him, he said:
0:57:1|0:57:9|[Xiao Fang] threw the welding mask on the ground while speaking.
0:57:11|0:57:29|On the other side in Hong Kong, [Driver Hua] and Wasabi are celebrating a birthday at a table with a large cake. After the birthday song, [Driver Hua] made a wish on the cake, then blew out the candles in one breath. After blowing them out, [Driver Hua] asked Wasabi if she knew what wish he had made.
0:57:39|0:57:54|[Driver Hua] still wanted to hear and praise the strawberry for playing very well, and the strawberry also liked it very much. When she heard the strawberry say she no longer liked playing the piano, [Driver Hua] sat up straight and asked her seriously why she wanted to give up. The strawberry expressed her unwillingness to play anymore.
0:57:58|0:58:18|[Driver Hua] slammed the table and shouted: Strawberry covered her ears with both hands, stared straight at [Driver Hua], and said, "Watching the tears gradually falling from Strawberry's eyes, [Driver Hua] helplessly leaned back on the chair, breathing heavily, shook his head in resignation, and then looked at the birthday cake.
0:58:22|0:58:28|[A Wei] put down the parasol and said:
0:59:18|0:59:32|[Leslie Guan] raised a glass of red wine to [Da Fu] and said, while the latter was very unwilling. [Driver Hua]'s phone rang, but he was sleeping on the sofa and didn't hear it. Strawberry noticed and walked slowly from the living room to pick up the phone.
1:0:0|1:0:24|Strawberry finished reading all the messages sent by [Li Yan], looked back at the sleeping [Driver Hua], then turned to look at the messages on the phone again, lost in thought. Early the next morning, the strong sunlight poured onto the small building where [Driver Hua] lived, and the same tune that [Li Yan] played during her interview drifted out of the building. [Driver Hua] widened his eyes and moved to the living room of his own home.
1:0:24|1:0:36|Approaching the piano gradually, his expression changed from shock to joy. The camera slowly zoomed in, revealing a small figure playing the piano smoothly - she is [Cao Mei].
1:0:37|1:0:54|Driver Hua happily squatted down beside her. Strawberry, upon seeing this, said, "Sorry for waking you up." [Driver Hua] happily replied that she didn't. He then mentioned how much he liked this alarm clock, before embracing Strawberry's head in his arms.
1:0:55|1:1:18|[Li Yan] looked at the decorative fish on the wall, took a bite of the popsicle, and then her phone rang. She stuffed the popsicle into her mouth, picked it up and looked at [Driver Hua], asking him what he wanted most right now. Walking on the road, [Driver Hua] received a reply saying he wanted an air conditioner the most. [Li Yan] blew the fan, ate the popsicle, and said, "[Driver Hua] wrote that he could give her one."
1:1:26|1:1:32|Li Yan happily pointed at the decorations on the wall and said, "After taking a few bites of the popsicle, I heard my phone ringing again."
1:1:35|1:1:48|Driver Hua said that Strawberry really wants to see Li Yan's concert. Can they both come to Shenzhen to find her? When Li Yan saw the smile on his face disappear, she took another bite of the popsicle, closed her phone, and stared at the ceiling.
1:1:52|1:2:6|For a long time without a response, [A Wei] turned around with instant noodles in hand, then handed them over. The buyer turned out to be Sushi Chef.
1:2:44|1:2:58|[Driver Hua] glanced at the sushi chef and said, "Hearing [Driver Hua] scold himself for being nosy, the sushi chef turned and left. At this moment, [Driver Hua] also complained that the other person was a big shot, then carried the air conditioner and left."
1:3:0|1:3:14|The scene shifts, [Ding Dang] is holding a spray paint can and drawing patterns on the wall. Just as she is about to finish, a police officer approaches. [Ding Dang] picks up the spray paint and sprays it on the police officer's face.
1:3:21|1:3:36|On the city walls are drawings by [Ding Dang], mostly cute heart shapes. Later, she rides her motorcycle to the coast, stops here, and shouts into the distance with her hands in a trumpet shape. At night, she rides her motorcycle to the entrance.
1:3:46|1:3:59|[Ding Dang] turned around with a smile, ready to get on the car. Suddenly, she fell forward straight, [A Wei] hurriedly ran up to check on her. Later, [Ding Dang] was taken to the hospital, while [A Wei] sat by her bedside guarding her.
1:4:0|1:4:7|At this moment, [Ding Dang] opened his eyes and slowly raised his hand to his neck. [A Wei] handed over the keys.
1:4:8|1:4:49|Upon seeing the key, [Ding Dang] raised her hand and took it. [A Wei] pursed his lips, lowered his head, and looked at [Ding Dang], saying: [A Wei] did not give a direct answer. Seeing the other person looking serious, [Ding Dang] took a deep breath and said again: [Ding Dang] slowly raised her hand to touch his cheek, comforting him: This comfort did not relax [A Wei], instead, he furrowed his brow and looked at [Ding Dang] again.
1:4:49|1:5:17|It's late at night, and while most people have entered dreamland, several protagonists find themselves unable to sleep. [Li Yan] sits by the window, fanning herself with a fan, glancing at her phone before setting it down, then staring blankly at the sky. [Driver Hua] leans against his own window, checking his phone and gazing into the distance. Meanwhile, [Wasabi] is at the restaurant, contemplating the radish-carved name "Wasabi" in front of him.
1:5:17|1:5:36|[Wasabi] leaned against the window, where a post-it note was missing to complete the heart shape. [Xiao Fang] squatted next to the bicycle and looked at the car logo that had been welded on, then made up her mind and knocked it off. [Xiao Qi] sat on the bed in the dormitory, sticking a glass bottle filled with plastic eyeballs on her face.
1:5:36|1:5:56|[Leslie Guan] stood on the balcony, one hand supporting his head as he looked at a photo. [A Wei] rested his chin on the table, watching two turtles slowly crawling around. [Ding Dang] leaned against the hospital bed, receiving an IV drip, picked up a paper airplane folded out of boredom, squeezed the head of the plane, and then forcefully threw it out.
1:6:20|1:6:41|Every day only thinks about himself, never considering the feelings of women. Then the woman takes a deep breath and says she really doesn't know what the other party wants to do. She asks the other party to think it over and then call her. After saying that, she hangs up the phone. [Wasabi], who has been silently watching from the opposite side, notices the woman crying and goes forward to comfort her.
1:6:42|1:6:59|Then the hot tea was placed in front of the woman. She lifted her head, smoothed her hair, said thank you, then turned around, took out a few pieces of tissue from the table and pressed them against her eyes. She cried softly again, sniffled, and then wiped her nose with the tissue, calming down slightly.
1:6:59|1:7:19|The woman turned around, took out a cigarette from her bag and held it between her fingers, asking if it could be lit. Upon hearing Driver Hua's refusal, the tears that the woman had been holding back burst out again. She then put down the cigarette, covered her face with both hands, wiped away the tears with her index finger, looked around and saw no one. The woman pleaded to let her smoke one.
1:7:30|1:7:46|The woman cried while saying that she would be fine in a while, but tears kept flowing down. She had to use her hands to wipe her nose and calm down. Then she bit her finger and looked towards the kitchen, saying, "Actually, the food in this restaurant is quite good." She then asked [Wasabi] where he learned his craft.
1:8:26|1:8:41|They seemed like nothing special, just an ordinary couple. They held hands under the table and exchanged warm glances. Later, they ordered ramen and it was ready.
1:9:0|1:9:20|The woman had stopped crying at this point, smiling as she recalled the past, and then said, love is actually such a simple thing. After seeing off the woman, [Wasabi] came to the locker, opened his own compartment, took out a thick stack of things, and slowly sat on the chair next to the locker in the room.
1:9:20|1:9:47|These are all recipes sent by [Wasabi] from around the world, each accompanied by his own photo. Then, the sushi master took a piece of paper and wrote down the recipe for a perfect meal. The scene then shifts to [Xiao Qi] and [Li Yan] standing in the factory aisle with their eyes closed. It has been the ninety-ninth day already. [Xiao Qi] slowly opens her eyes and sees [Xiao Fang] waiting outside the aisle, saying:
1:9:51|1:10:10|Xiao Fang, leaning against the big tree, was not looking at Xiao Qi as before, but was lost in thought. Strawberry, holding a doll, said to Driver Hua, "Driver Hua," who stood up from the dining table after listening, saying, "Adult matters, children shouldn't worry about them."
1:10:10|1:10:18|At this moment, Strawberry picked up the phone placed on the dining table by [Driver Hua], and searched for the contact with the nickname "Pianist" in the address book.
1:10:27|1:11:1|Li Yan was stunned after hearing it. Driver Hua, who was selling invincible smoothies on the street, answered Strawberry's call and said he had already arranged a meeting with Li Yan for tomorrow afternoon at three o'clock. Driver Hua was very happy and surprised. Seeing a sports car passing by, he exclaimed, "Oh no." The camera then shifted to a sushi chef selecting ingredients at a supermarket.
1:11:7|1:11:38|The sushi chef picked up the phone on the table, dialed a few keys and made a call. After that, [Wasabi] threw the phone away, which ended up being smashed. Seeing that [Wasabi] still didn't answer his call, the sushi chef frowned. [Wasabi] anxiously held the phone and kept pressing it. On the other side, [Driver Hua] put on a Ferrari cap and asked Strawberry if he looked like a professional driver.
1:11:43|1:11:52|[Driver Hua] patted Wasabi's head after listening, then she said, "After that, [Driver Hua] hugged the air conditioner and walked away."
1:11:52|1:12:15|At this moment, inside the Shenzhen bus station, [Li Yan] changed into a dress, ran up the stairs, stepped onto the pedestrian overpass, and her phone rang again. Upon checking, [Driver Hua] said he had arrived and asked where [Li Yan] was. After adjusting her posture against the aluminum handrail, [Li Yan] turned around and spotted [Driver Hua]'s back. She then tiptoed behind [Driver Hua], thought for a moment, and tapped his shoulder.
1:12:16|1:12:34|The two locked eyes, both taken aback, their previously smiling faces now gone. After sizing each other up, [Li Yan] pointed to the Ferrari cap on [Driver Hua]'s head, the matching outfit, and the air conditioning on the ground, then looked at her own attire. The two burst into laughter together.
1:12:34|1:12:52|After laughing among the crowd for a while, it turned out that both of them had lied about their identities. [Li Yan] smiled and spoke first: On the other side, the sushi chef and apprentices were preparing dishes.
1:12:59|1:13:7|In front of the store, a sign reads: "A perfect meal for only one person." At this moment, [Da Fu] is packing his luggage.
1:13:49|1:14:5|Just as [Leslie Guan] was about to say something, the phone suddenly rang, and [Da Fu] quickly answered it. On the other side, [A Wei] returned to [Xiao Qi] with a parasol, and the light bulb that was so hard to find was hanging on the eaves.
1:14:7|1:14:32|[A Wei] took the light bulb down, held it to his ear and shook it, then smiled and said: "Later, he firmly grasped the light bulb in his hand." The scene switched to the hospital room, [A Wei] lay next to [Ding Dang], staring at her foolishly. [Ding Dang] looked weakly at the ceiling and said:
1:14:42|1:14:55|After decisively refusing, [Ding Dang] shifted her gaze from the ceiling to [A Wei]'s face, then spoke: [A Wei] didn't respond, but crossed his arms and looked at [Ding Dang], then turned his whole body and said:
1:14:58|1:15:26|[A Wei] earnestly suggested to [Ding Dang], who looked at him, she smiled and [Ding Dang] was touched. Then she slowly moved her gaze back to the ceiling. On the other side, [Wasabi] was sitting by the window flipping through a magazine restlessly, then threw it behind her. As a result, some sticky notes on the window fell off. She hurriedly picked them up, and reattached them crookedly. After sticking them back on, she suddenly realized that this heart shape had been filled up.
1:15:26|1:15:40|Then she smiled at the sticky note. The apprentice with short hair turned to the apprentice with glasses and said, "At this moment, a woman arrived at the shop door."
1:15:50|1:15:59|The sushi chef immediately looked up and saw [Wasabi] standing beside him. He stood up, placed his hands behind his back and leaned on the table, listening to the other party say:
1:16:2|1:16:10|[Wasabi] looked up and asked the sushi chef, who then placed a plate of sushi on the dining table.
1:16:12|1:16:18|[Wasabi] picked up the chopsticks after listening, then picked up a small piece and put it into his mouth.
1:16:20|1:16:39|The fish woman said to the fish baby: [Wasabi] paused for a moment after eating, then slowly swallowed it. She pursed her lips, picked up the chopsticks again, picked up the second one and put it in her mouth. After chewing twice, she quickly spit it into the plate next to her. The fish baby said anxiously:
1:17:2|1:17:10|After the sushi chef finished speaking, he lowered his head apologetically, knowing that the other party had deceived him earlier. [Wasabi] pursed his lips, then sighed and said:
1:17:21|1:17:30|[Wasabi] with tears in his eyes said to him:
1:17:50|1:17:58|[Li Yan] raised her blistered hand and said to [Driver Hua], who was installing the air conditioner, "At this moment, [Leslie Guan] is walking over, supporting [Da Fu]'s arm."
1:18:3|1:18:9|Two people arrived at a film and television city, where four half-naked men were constantly blowing alcohol onto torches in their hands.
1:18:10|1:18:33|Yuan Yuan walked out in Egyptian attire, holding up a sign from behind that read: "No photos allowed." She seemed to have gone from a model to a sign girl. Suddenly, something came flying towards [Leslie Guan], causing him to quickly bend over.
1:18:40|1:18:53|After settling him down, the lights in the film and television city were turned towards the stage. Many people crowded around the knives and fire pots. Suddenly, he noticed a lone girl. [Da Fu] put down the spotlight, picked up the knives and fire pot, and rushed over.
1:18:58|1:19:5|So the two of them hid under the prop brazier together and rushed to Leslie Guan's side. After putting down the prop brazier, Da Fu exclaimed in surprise:
1:19:8|1:19:16|Yuan Yuan turned to look at [Leslie Guan]. The sushi chef arrived in front of [Wasabi].
1:19:19|1:19:35|[Wasabi] lowered his head after listening, thought for a moment, then looked up at the sushi chef and smiled as he nodded at him.
1:20:5|1:20:35|Yuan Yuan lowered her head and thought for a moment, saying: With tears in her eyes, she pleaded with Yuan Yuan. She was moved, then turned to look in the direction of [Da Fu], and then Yuan Yuan picked up a clean piece of hail from the ground and applied it to the wound on [Da Fu]'s forehead. Feeling the warmth in Yuan Yuan's hands, [Da Fu] also gazed affectionately at her.
1:20:42|1:20:49|Driver Hua sat on the upper bunk and suggested to Li Yan: "Li Yan, climb up and press the air conditioning switch." Then she looked at Driver Hua happily and said:
1:20:59|1:21:13|Yuan Yuan moved her hand away from [Da Fu]'s wound, and at this moment, they both looked towards the crowd making noise. The people were picking up hailstones from the ground, throwing them at each other, and shouting how refreshing it was.
1:21:13|1:21:45|The scene then shifts again, with [Wasabi] gazing affectionately at the sushi chef, who smiles. Li Yan approaches Xiao Qi with a large basin of dolls and speaks to her, but Xiao Qi doesn't even notice Xiao Fang's presence. Xiao Qi looks under the wall and even on the roof, but finds nothing.
1:21:46|1:21:57|For the first ninety-nine days, Xiao Fang appeared at random times next to the big tree on the roof and by the wall, but on the one hundredth day, he was nowhere to be found. So Xiao Qi ran to the convenience store.
1:22:6|1:22:15|[Xiao Qi] immediately rode her bike to the train station, while [Xiao Fang] stood in line at the ticket counter with her luggage, reminiscing.
1:22:36|1:23:7|After the boss finished speaking, he took off the watch and handed it to [Xiao Fang], then placed the watch in [Xiao Fang]'s hand. While [Xiao Fang] had already bought the train ticket, [Xiao Qi] was also riding her bicycle desperately in the sweltering weather, sweating profusely as she headed towards the direction of the train station, afraid of missing [Xiao Fang]. Finally, she arrived, threw down her bicycle and ran to the waiting area. Looking back and not seeing [Xiao Fang], she rushed towards the train platform.
1:23:9|1:23:16|[Xiao Fang] is sitting in the seat at this moment, occasionally looking at the watch on her wrist.
1:23:25|1:23:32|[Xiao Qi] snatched the megaphone and shouted, then wiped away tears and said:
1:23:43|1:23:55|Hearing the voice, [Xiao Fang] immediately turned to look out the window, then quickly turned back after seeing [Xiao Qi]. Thinking about the other party's questioning, he lowered his head and couldn't help but cry. On the other side,
1:23:55|1:24:12|[Xiao Qi] saw that [Xiao Fang] was not responding and sat on the ground, crying helplessly. Even so, [Xiao Fang] did not look back at her, but instead leaned against his forehead and cried continuously. After hearing the other person call his name, he finally couldn't help but burst into tears.
1:24:12|1:24:39|At this point, everyone on the platform has left, except for [Xiao Qi], who is kneeling on the ground crying while holding a megaphone. The scene shifts to the hospital room, where [A Wei] rushes in with a helmet and helps [Ding Dang] up. It turns out the two of them went out on [A Wei]'s small motorcycle.
1:24:51|1:24:58|In the night of Hong Kong, [A Wei] drove through the traffic lights with [Ding Dang], heading straight ahead. She held onto [A Wei]'s waist, slowly resting her head on his shoulder.
1:24:59|1:25:2|Dodging the wind on both sides, [Ding Dang] laughed happily.
1:25:13|1:25:20|Suddenly, all the lights went out.
1:25:30|1:25:40|The little fish was originally able to witness the sushi master and [Wasabi] kissing, so he could win the bet and marry the goldfish woman, but the power outage shattered his dream.
1:25:54|1:26:9|Sitting on the sofa, Driver Hua gestured the action of fastening the seat belt and stepping on the gas pedal, saying that Li Yan also pretended to fasten the seat belt and sat next to Driver Hua.
1:26:13|1:26:29|Then Driver Hua carefully took Li Yan's hand and placed it gently against his own ear. Driver Hua closed his eyes and said earnestly, "Li Yan." Li Yan smiled happily and looked back at him.
1:26:29|1:26:54|On the other side, [A Wei] was driving [Ding Dang] on the viaduct. Looking through the rearview mirror, he saw her leaning on his shoulder. Suddenly, a light flashed, revealing the image of [A Wei]'s late wife. It turned out to be the light shadow left by [A Wei] riding his motorcycle quickly. Meanwhile, [Driver Hua] had already pulled [Li Yan]'s hand down from her ear and placed it on her chest. After giving her a kiss, they interlocked their fingers.
1:26:54|1:27:15|Then they placed their clasped hands on their hearts and rubbed them. At this moment, the light of the small motorcycle flashed into the sushi restaurant, where the sushi chef and [Wasabi] stood face to face. Then the two closed their eyes and slowly touched lips. In the fish tank opposite them, the fish and the fish lady were also kissing each other passionately.
1:27:15|1:27:23|At this moment, in a dark city, [A Wei] is carrying [Ding Dang], riding a motorcycle weaving through various overpasses. The scene shifts,
1:27:23|1:27:40|[A Wei]'s headlights are shining directly into the camera. Under the headlights, it is clear to see [Ding Dang] firmly holding onto [A Wei]'s waist. With the wind blowing, [A Wei] squints his eyes behind the helmet, while [Ding Dang] is securely protected behind him.
1:27:52|1:28:12|[A Wei] turned back and smiled gently at [Ding Dang]. After [Ding Dang] blinked, she leaned her head on his shoulder again. At this moment, the small motorcycle was driving parallel to the brightly lit skyscrapers, with each leap causing the lights behind to go out. Gradually, the entire Hong Kong was plunged into darkness, with only the small motorcycle visible.
1:28:18|1:28:40|Yuan Yuan posed and smiled at the photographer, who was none other than [Da Fu]. After the shoot, he checked the camera and then looked at Yuan Yuan, saying, "After that, he glanced at the old watch on his wrist."
1:28:47|1:29:8|Da Fu turned out to be Xiao Fang's son. At this moment, the movie goes back to a day twenty years ago. The bell for the factory's lunch break rang, and after Xiao Qi tidied up her desk and wiped her hands, she stood up and looked out the window. Xiao Fang, wearing a shirt and trousers, stood against the wall and smiled at Xiao Qi.
