0:0:39|0:0:55|The door was opened by a young man wearing a beret. After a brief eye contact, the man with glasses entered the newspaper office carrying a basket. Inside the office, many staff members were busy at their respective positions, with newspapers being printed and reporting on the current anti-Japanese war situation.
0:2:8|0:2:24|On the yellow soil along the coast, [Lin Xiang] is still explaining radio knowledge to the soldiers. On the other side, [Lan Fang] is sitting on the rooftop drawing a children's collaborative painting. Suddenly, as if knowing something, he stands up and walks towards the edge of the rooftop.
0:2:24|0:2:29|[Qin Fengwu] closed the sketchbook, placed both hands on the railing at the edge, and looked down at the alley below.
0:2:35|0:2:48|In the narrow alley, several military trucks suddenly appeared. Japanese soldiers on the trucks, each holding a rifle horizontally, dispersed without warning and surrounded the gate of the Minsheng Daily News.
0:3:20|0:3:35|Outside the house, Japanese soldiers have started throwing grenades to siege the building. The officer in charge insists on not negotiating. At this moment, the leader of the Japanese army walks into the dilapidated Shanghai Minsheng Newspaper Office, illuminates the staircase on the second floor, points upwards, and shouts loudly:
0:3:38|0:3:50|A young man with a gun rushed from the corner of the second floor and aimed at the Japanese junior officer downstairs in the secret radio room, using a large cabinet to block the door.
0:3:50|0:4:7|The two men holding the important radio parts have quietly arrived at the rooftop of the newspaper office, ready to split up. The young man who had just fought with the Japanese soldiers inside the newspaper office was now lying at the staircase with a face full of blood. He watched as a large number of Japanese soldiers walked towards the second floor, and in his dying moments, he detonated a hand grenade.
0:4:12|0:4:30|The huge impact sent the Japanese soldiers flying out. The newspaper office had become a mess. At this moment, the man in the beret tightly held a small package and ran to the street. The Japanese military trucks drove into the alleys of the island, and the street vendors' stalls were also brought into the mainland for bullying, whether it was the ordinary people strolling on the street or the small vendors.
0:4:30|0:4:45|Everyone was scared and quickly hid in all directions. The man in the beret slung the package diagonally across his body and then ran frantically towards the safe zone. A big truck chased closely behind him, knocking down all the thatched sheds on both sides of the narrow alley.
0:4:45|0:5:0|On the other side, the man with glasses who escaped from the newspaper office with the beret man arrived at a relatively safe street. He quickly ran into the International Savings Bank on the side of the street, adjusted his cramped state, put his hands in his mouth, and calmly walked into the house.
0:5:0|0:5:17|Approaching is a woman dressed in Japanese military uniform, [Masako Akiyama]. She walks with her head held high and expressionless. Unexpectedly, as she passes by the man with glasses, she suddenly delivers a high kick towards him. The man with glasses is caught off guard by this situation, but quickly retaliates.
0:5:17|0:5:32|Immediately, the two of them started fighting bare-handedly. The scene then shifts to the man in the beret, he swiftly runs towards the bridge with quick steps, followed closely by a large group of Japanese soldiers carrying long rifles. The man in the beret runs towards the center of the bridge.
0:5:32|0:5:41|Unexpectedly, a group of Japanese soldiers also ran towards them. Surrounded by the two enemy forces, the brave man, Lei Maonan, didn't hesitate to run towards the edge of the bridge, leaped into the air, and landed on the bridge.
0:5:41|0:5:56|He fell into the water and swam towards the deep part of the river. The Japanese soldiers on the bridge started shooting at him, but the polite man in the river took the bullets for him. The river was filled with blood, and the important documents wrapped in the package slowly sank to the bottom of the river with his death.
0:5:56|0:6:12|Inside the Bank of Nations, the fight between the man with glasses and the Japanese female officer [Masako Akiyama] is coming to an end. They are fighting on the second floor of the bank, [Masako Akiyama] lands several high side kicks on the man with glasses, leaving him dizzy. Then she delivers a flying kick, sending him crashing into the central chandelier in the room.
0:6:12|0:6:25|And the important radio components wrapped in his package also fell to the ground in the bank hall. Inside the newspaper office, Chief Guan used his body to block the iron door of the radio, but unexpectedly, a hand grenade blew him out, and he struggled to get up from the ground.
0:6:31|0:6:48|[Qin Fengwu], dressed in a straight suit, holding an umbrella handle with a skull on it, walked in from the door. She first used the umbrella to poke at the radio that had been blown to pieces, then placed the umbrella on the table, picked up the sharp knife at hand and stabbed towards Guan, the chief. Then she threw the chief out of the second-floor window.
0:6:48|0:6:53|Thus, the underground Communist Party radio station in Shanghai was completely destroyed by the Japanese army.
0:7:6|0:7:14|Japanese soldiers not only destroyed our underground secret radio station, but also cruelly killed many of our comrades who were defending the station.
0:7:14|0:7:26|[Lin Xiang], after receiving the order from his superiors to rebuild the radio station, stood alone on the desolate loess plateau. He looked down upon the numerous hills in front of him, his gaze determined and courageous, as if no challenge could daunt him.
0:7:27|0:7:35|But in all the hills, it seems so small, a radio intelligence battle is about to begin.
0:7:35|0:7:50|"The remake of 'Counterattack' is based on the classic film 'Never Fading Waves'. Behind the release of this film, the script alone took three years to create, with four changes in screenwriters and six revisions in art drafts. The screenwriters also consulted a large amount of historical records and made certain innovations."
0:7:50|0:8:4|The film is a spy action movie produced by Nanhai Film "Fenggu Culture", directed by Zhong Shaoxiong, starring [Aaron Kwok], [Zhao Liying], [Zhang Han], [Zhang Lanxin], [Zhu Yilong], [Yu Xiaoguang], [Li Bin], [Cao Cao].
0:8:4|0:8:14|The film tells the story of Lin Xiang, an underground worker who was sent to the perilous Shanghai after the Songhu Battle to rebuild the underground resistance against the Japanese invaders.
0:8:14|0:8:30|Here, he meets the simple yet righteous [Lan Fang], and the two temporarily pose as a fake couple. This underground party couple, one representing justice and the other evil, join hands to confront the Japanese invaders and the spies of the puppet government in a thrilling life-and-death struggle amidst the raging war.
0:8:30|0:8:45|In the streets of Shanghai, Japanese flags are hanging everywhere, and Japanese troops are marching with flags held high. Military trucks are driving behind them, and even the civilians are standing on the side of the street holding Japanese flags. At this moment, the superior is giving orders to [Masako Akiyama].
0:9:14|0:9:17|This is a completely different world from Yan'an, filled with a sense of gloom in the air.
0:9:46|0:10:3|Radio station political commissar [Lin Xiang] also arrived in Shanghai at this time. He stood on the street, mingling with the crowd, watching the large Japanese army entering Shanghai, feeling very uneasy. Then he went to his residence, placed his luggage on the table, roughly checked the room, opened the window, and looked out at the scenery outside.
0:10:14|0:10:20|After Masako Akiyama left, Qin Fengwu snorted fiercely. Inside the Hua Jie Textile Factory on the other side, a young man exclaimed excitedly,
0:11:12|0:11:25|Watching her colleagues talking about the tasks they received, only the textile factory worker [Lan Fang] did not receive any task. She sat in her seat looking a bit lonely, not even interested in the melon seeds she usually enjoyed.
0:11:25|0:11:31|[Lan Fang] looked around at her colleagues, then lowered her head expressionlessly, her thoughts unknown.
0:11:32|0:11:40|Early the next morning, the underground Communist Party intelligence officer [Big Cat] in Shanghai had a pipe in his mouth and a camera in his hand, taking photos of [Lin Xiang]'s residence.
0:11:40|0:11:54|[Lin Xiang] walked out of the house and looked up at his residence on the second floor, only to see [Big Cat] had already put away his carefree demeanor and was installing wooden boards on the roof of [Lin Xiang]'s place. After working busily for a while, he came to the corridor on the second floor and reached up to change the light bulb above his head.
0:11:55|0:12:9|The flowers and plants at the entrance were placed on the wooden board Lin Xiang had just installed, while Lin Xiang stood downstairs watching everything. After Big Cat finished cleaning up and left, he walked to the second-floor corridor, first looking up at the light bulbs that had been replaced.
0:12:9|0:12:15|Takaji reached out and unscrewed the light bulb, then took out the piece of paper between the bulb and the lampshade.
0:12:16|0:12:26|Shortly after, [Lin Xiang] squatted down and took out a light bulb from the toolbox at his feet, replaced it, then stood up and pulled the nearby rope. The light bulb immediately lit up.
0:12:26|0:12:38|After all this was done, he came down to the platform downstairs to have tea, while [Big Cat] stood below the platform, with a cigarette in his mouth, facing away from [Lin Xiang], picked up the camera and took a selfie of the two.
0:12:38|0:12:54|The sky was very dark, an old man leaning on a cane was pulling a small cart walking in a narrow alley. He slowly walked to the defeated Shanghai Longsheng Newspaper Office, looked up at the sign of the newspaper office, and then walked in unsteadily.
0:12:54|0:13:0|The room was already in ruins, with the bombed tables, chairs, and benches all charred beyond recognition.
0:13:0|0:13:17|On the day of the incident, with the Japanese troops increasing in Shanghai and the newspaper reporting the defeat of the Nationalist Army being burned beyond recognition, the old man looked up at the building, then pushed the cart into the room where the secret radio station was previously stored. He walked to a table, picked up a round piece with a hollow center with his hand.
0:13:17|0:13:29|Carefully examining the surroundings, he blew on it with his mouth, then picked up the long-handled button for the transmitter and put it into his waist pocket. Finally, the old man walked into the innermost room.
0:13:32|0:13:36|The old man glanced at him without paying attention and continued walking inside.
0:13:41|0:13:48|He stood up as if unwilling to give up, poking the old man with the umbrella, causing the old man to fearfully retreat.
0:13:52|0:14:4|The old man took the biscuit and ate it greedily. At that moment, [Qin Fengwu]'s body gradually leaned towards the old man. Unexpectedly, the biscuit crumbs sprayed out by the old man due to eating too fast landed straight on [Qin Fengwu]'s head.
0:14:4|0:14:33|Qin Fengwu was so angry that he knocked the old man down with an umbrella. At this moment, Masako Akiyama arrived in the room with a few henchmen. The old man got up from the ground, looking at Qin Fengwu with a gaze that was both angry and sharp. Qin Fengwu, standing in front of the mirror, suddenly walked towards the old man, feeling around his body until he touched a hard object around his waist. Qin Fengwu smirked. Seeing this, the old man picked up a sharp object nearby and pressed it against Qin Fengwu's neck. Cen Zimo quickly aimed a gun at the old man. Qin Fengwu held up the umbrella and fell to the ground, shouting loudly.
0:14:35|0:14:43|Masako Akiyama did not care about her companion Qin Fengwu. The old man took advantage of the chaos to push Qin Fengwu forward, while he himself ran out of the window.
0:14:47|0:15:18|Masako Akiyama pushed Qin Fengwu away in a hurry and chased after the old man escaping. The old man jumped from the window and lay straight on the barrier-free passage by the stairs, sliding down with gravity. Masako Akiyama followed closely, jumping next to the stair railing. Seeing the old man sliding through several turns, Masako Akiyama didn't hesitate, jumping directly to a lower railing. After a few rounds, Masako Akiyama finally caught up with the old man, without saying a word, she lifted her foot and kicked towards him. It was clear that the old man was also skilled.
0:15:18|0:15:33|It was easy to dodge. As the two were fighting, a man with sunglasses suddenly appeared on the second-floor corridor. He could see the two fighting, quickly hid by the wall, then looked up at the big barrel on the rooftop and ran up quickly.
0:15:33|0:15:52|The man in sunglasses used a crowbar to smash the barrel towards the fighting area, but it had no effect twice in a row. He smashed the barrel towards the ground again, successfully separating the two. The old man took the opportunity to turn and run, while [Masako Akiyama] angrily looked towards the rooftop. The man in sunglasses quickly turned and left.
0:15:52|0:15:59|The old man escaped and ran on the street, with the [Japanese soldiers] chasing closely behind, shouting for him to stop, and ordering the surrounding civilians to move aside.
0:16:2|0:16:20|The old man fled to a gathering place of beggars, then quickly found a safe place to hide. Japanese soldiers with guns soon caught up, destroying the thatched explosive hole made by the beggars in search of someone, and indiscriminately shooting and killing innocent beggars. [Masako Akiyama] watched the scene from the second floor, not daring to make any rash moves.
0:16:20|0:16:27|The soldiers downstairs were still burning, killing, and looting wantonly. After searching for a while and not finding anyone, they soon left.
0:16:28|0:16:38|[Mo Jingnan] came downstairs and watched as the beggars cleaned up the tents destroyed by the Japanese army. He looked around and didn't find the person he wanted to see, so he began shouting loudly.
0:16:48|0:16:55|The old man hiding in the shadows pulled off the mask on his face, revealing that he was actually [Lin Xiang] in disguise.
0:17:28|0:17:43|Originally, the identity of the man in sunglasses is the underground Communist Party member [Cen Zimo]. What he shouted means, "I am probationary party member [Cen Zimo], subordinate of the chief of the public security bureau. I was out on a mission when the newspaper office had an incident, but lost contact with the organization. Now I request to return to the team."
0:17:43|0:17:55|[Lin Xiang], after listening to these words, did not immediately believe them, but instead remained silent in the shadows. [Lin Xiang] tidied himself up, glanced at [Cen Zimo] on the second floor, then left the place and returned to his residence.
0:17:55|0:18:9|He sat at the table and made a simple radio by himself, lifting the movable wooden board on the ground, fixing the radio on top of it, and then flipping it back. At night, as the sky started to pour rain, [Lin Xiang] walked on the street with an umbrella.
0:18:20|0:18:38|Walking into a narrow alley, two Japanese people behind him called out to him. [Masako Akiyama] turned around and locked eyes with them, the rain seemed to have gotten heavier. A member of the Fa Clan patrol, [Liang Dong], wearing a cloak, rode a bicycle to a secluded place where a man wearing clogs on his feet reported to him.
0:18:49|0:19:6|[Liang Dong] struck a match, lit his cigarette, and walked towards the crime scene. Along the way, the patrol officer greeted him hastily. [Liang Dong] walked slowly up to the body, where a Japanese man lay on his back on the ground, with an umbrella handle sticking out of his chest.
0:19:6|0:19:14|In a flash, the Japanese man charged at [Lin Xiang] with a sword, and [Lin Xiang] blocked it with an umbrella, which was then sliced in half.
0:19:21|0:19:26|Another Japanese man was killed by [Lin Xiang] with a dagger stabbed into his abdomen.
0:20:10|0:20:29|Colonel Yamazaki slammed the table suddenly, staring at [Liang Dong] and demanding to know the situation. [Liang Dong] was so scared that he immediately knelt down to answer. After hearing this explanation, Colonel Yamazaki was so angry that he slammed the table and stood up.
0:20:44|0:20:59|[Colonel Yamazaki] slapped him in the face in anger, and the dancer beside him brought out a bottle of wine, telling [Liang Dong], "If you finish it, I'll give you three more days," then smiled. [Liang Dong] looked up at [Colonel Yamazaki] and also smiled.
0:20:59|0:21:12|Without saying a word, he picked up the bottle and poured it into his mouth until it was empty, his face covered in wine stains. Colonel Yamazaki picked up a stack of banknotes from the table, smiling as he placed the banknotes horizontally on Liang Dong's head.
0:21:13|0:21:16|At this moment, [Liang Dong] showed no signs of anger, but instead grinned and laughed out loud.
0:21:19|0:21:25|After [Colonel Yamazaki] finished, he stuffed the banknotes into [Liang Dong]'s chest and then shouted at him to get lost.
0:21:27|0:21:40|Kneeling on the ground, [Liang Dong] slightly raised his body and walked towards the door, but he fell to the ground before taking a few steps. He picked up the banknotes beside him, then stood up and stuffed them into his chest, laughing heartily as he walked towards the door.
0:22:5|0:22:8|Lin Xiang carried Lan Fang on his shoulders and brought her into the Yi Ji Hall.
0:22:16|0:22:28|The Japanese soldiers brought [Lan Fang] into a room, threw her violently to the ground, and then closed the door with a smile. As [Lan Fang] got up, she overturned the table in front of her, attracting the attention of [Liang Dong] in the restroom.
0:22:28|0:22:42|[Liang Dong] listened to the sound and slowly approached the house. He walked to the outside of the house and, through the crack in the doorway, saw the Japanese soldiers pressing [He Lan Fang] underneath them. Seeing this scene, tears filled [Liang Dong]'s eyes. He pushed the door open wide, wanting to go forward to save the person.
0:22:43|0:22:52|But when Li Zhi pulled him back, he just watched quietly as [Lan Fang] faced her ordeal, and at that moment, [Lan Fang] also saw [Liang Dong] standing indifferently outside the door.
0:22:52|0:23:2|[Liang Dong] saw the look in his eyes, and suddenly flashed back to a scene from his childhood where he locked eyes with a little girl. Just as he was about to open the door to stop them, [Helan Fang]'s companion had already rushed in and loudly intervened.
0:23:9|0:23:30|Immediately, [Lan Fang]'s companions were wrestling with the Japanese soldiers, and [Liang Dong] saw someone coming to help and firmly closed the door. [Lan Fang] slowly got up from the ground and picked up a bottle to smash towards the Japanese soldiers.
0:23:36|0:23:48|Several people ran onto the main street, and the man with a beard at the door quickly picked up a camera. The Japanese soldiers also ran out, and [Lan Fang] and the others pushed the cart next to them, crashing into the Japanese soldiers.
0:23:48|0:24:5|He [Lan Fang] and his companions left this place of controversy, while the bearded man at the door was still holding a camera and taking pictures in their direction as they left. At night, [Liang Dong] rode his bike slowly to a stop in front of his house, carrying the things from the bike inside and laying out the items he bought on the table.
0:24:13|0:24:16|He then threw the chicken on the table onto the ground.
0:24:29|0:24:43|[Liang Dong] was kicked out of the house by his mother with a broom. He walked to the alley, feeling restless and unable to calm down. Then he picked up a gun and shot at an empty glass bottle. At that moment, the resident on the second floor opened the window and cursed loudly.
0:24:49|0:25:8|Liang Dong, who was being scolded, felt even worse. He threw away half of the cigarette in his mouth, then sat on the platform by the artificial pond. He took out the cigarette case but found it empty, and threw it away. At this moment, Cen Zimo sat down beside him and handed him the cigarette case.
0:25:8|0:25:10|[Liang Dong] took a cigarette and spoke.
0:25:19|0:25:31|[Liang Dong] fell silent after hearing [Cen Zimo]'s response. Tears welled up in the corners of his eyes as he took a deep drag on his cigarette, exhaling smoke as if trying to calm his troubled mind, before finally speaking.
0:26:0|0:26:16|He watched as [Cen Zimo] spoke again, then both [Liang Dong] turned and left. [Cen Zimo] sat by the pond, quietly watching his figure. The next day, the streets were bustling with people, with vendors setting up stalls on both sides of the street.
0:26:16|0:26:30|[Lin Xiang] came to a vendor selling various parts. He picked and chose in front of the goods, took out a part and listened to it by his ear. After feeling that it was what he wanted, he handed a few pieces of silver to the boss, turned around with a long pancake umbrella, and left.
0:26:31|0:26:47|Returning to his residence, [Lin Xiang] sat at the table and got busy. He took a screwdriver and tightened the screws on the radio, then picked up a palm-sized object resembling an oxygen cylinder and installed it on the radio. Next, he picked up the conductor wire on the table, inserted it into the radio, and began the installation.
0:26:47|0:26:57|At night, [Lin Xiang] finally finished producing the radio station. He put on his headphones, turned on the desk lamp, connected the radio to the power source, and started transmitting information to the outside world.
0:27:15|0:27:19|The leader stood up to take the telegram and, looking at the content, began to speak.
0:27:27|0:27:33|[Liang Dong] approached [Masako Akiyama] wearing sunglasses and holding a file, gesturing for her to take a look. However, [Masako Akiyama] told him,
0:27:36|0:27:40|[Liang Dong] and [Masako Akiyama] arrived at a shop, where the shopkeeper greeted them.
0:27:46|0:28:3|The shopkeeper took out an ID card for them to check, but [Masako Akiyama] said it was not hers at all. [Liang Dong] and [Masako Akiyama] came out of the shop, and he accidentally saw someone looking at them from the window on the second floor. The discovered [Lin Xiang] quickly put down the curtain, and [Liang Dong] immediately prepared to go upstairs to ask him.
0:28:4|0:28:19|[Lin Xiang] agilely escapes from the complex rooftops. [Liang Dong] throws the documents aside and quickly follows. While [Lin Xiang] moves swiftly across the rooftops, [Liang Dong] keeps an eye on his escape route, chasing through various residential buildings.
0:28:19|0:28:30|[Lin Xiang] took a big step from one rooftop to another, with [Liang Dong] closely following him, causing [Masako Akiyama] to spill her meal. Without hesitation, he quickly caught up with them.
0:28:30|0:28:49|Lin Xiang performed a front somersault on the roof, then ran forward expressionlessly. Liang Dong walked past the wooden planks connecting the house and the corridor, opened one room door, then walked to another room and opened it. He rushed up the stairs. Lin Xiang jumped down from a distance, and then Liang Dong opened a door beside him.
0:28:49|0:29:7|[Liang Dong] watched as [Lin Xiang] ran ahead, but he caught up with him. The distance between the two became shorter and shorter. At that moment, [Liang Dong] jumped onto a wooden board, but it couldn't bear his weight and broke. [Liang Dong] fell down from the board and watched as [Lin Xiang] ran past him. He angrily threw his sunglasses aside.
0:29:8|0:29:25|He stood up, looked in the direction of [Lin Xiang], angrily kicked open the door in front of him and chased after. [Lin Xiang] swiftly shuttled across various rooftops, with [Liang Dong] not far behind in hot pursuit. He arrived at a corridor, watching [Lin Xiang] who had just leaped over, but he dared not take the risk to jump over himself.
0:29:25|0:29:40|He picked up the ladder next to him and placed it in the center of two buildings, then slid his body along the ladder. [Lin Xiang] ran very fast, after passing through several buildings, he found a hiding room, entered directly through the window, and then turned around to close the window.
0:29:41|0:29:54|[Liang Dong] followed closely and arrived at this place, only to find no sign of [Lin Xiang]. He cautiously took out a gun from his pocket and approached the door of a room, where he saw a big lock hanging on it. Then he headed towards another room.
0:29:54|0:30:13|Little did he know, his every move was being watched by [Lin Xiang] lurking in the shadows. [Liang Dong] held a gun and searched every corner. Suddenly, a noise caught his attention. He approached the source of the sound, ready to break in. At that moment, [Lin Xiang] was hiding inside the house, seeing [Liang Dong]'s gun through a crack, then turned and picked up a sharp knife from a bamboo basket.
0:30:13|0:30:28|Ready to fight at any moment. One person holding a knife inside the house, the other holding a gun outside. [Liang Dong] slowly approaches the door, [Lin Xiang] gripping the sharp knife in his hand, his eyes sharp and ready to take a life at any moment. Just as [Liang Dong] is about to break open the door, someone downstairs suddenly starts calling out to him.
0:30:40|0:30:42|[Liang Dong] immediately ran downstairs.
0:31:3|0:31:21|Inside the house, [Lin Xiang] watched as [Liang Dong] walked away, slowly putting down the sharp knife in his hand. [Liang Dong] rushed to the police station, running through the hall and bumping into many colleagues along the way. Just as he reached the stairs and was about to go down, the bearded man who had taken photos at the Yiji Inn gate called out to him.
0:31:33|0:31:43|[Liang Dong] held a photo and found that it was all images of [Lan Fang] and her companions. He furrowed his brows, stared fiercely at the bearded man with his eyes, and then looked away.
0:32:1|0:32:8|In another part of the lobby, Qin Fengwu and his family sat at a table on the second floor, with his son drawing with a pencil and muttering to himself.
0:32:15|0:32:26|The son is drawing himself and his dad [Qin Fengwu] on the paper, and writes "me and my dear dad". [Qin Fengwu] is smiling, holding a lollipop and reaching for the chocolate waterfall on the table, then handing it to his son.
0:32:29|0:32:44|The mother, who was elegantly dressed on the side, had her attention on [Cen Zimo] playing the piano on the first floor. Her captivating gaze and smiling face were fixed on [Cen Zimo]. Upon noticing the woman looking at him, [Cen Zimo] expressionlessly lowered his head and continued playing the piano.
0:32:44|0:32:49|The woman showed no sign of dissatisfaction and instead shifted her gaze back to her son.
0:33:7|0:33:26|[Cen Zimo] first widened his eyes, paused for a moment, then his eyes gradually turned red, and he grinned at [Lin Xiang]. From then on, [Cen Zimo] finally returned to the organization. On the other side, in the dark prison cell, [Liang Dong] strode ahead, followed by Captain Yamazaki and a group of Japanese soldiers.
0:33:26|0:33:36|They arrived at a prison cell, where [Lan Fang] and his companions were locked up. They were kneeling on the ground, with their hands tied behind their backs. They looked up at the person entering the cell with a calm and dignified expression.
0:33:37|0:33:49|[Liang Dong] glanced at [Helan Fang] kneeling on the ground with wide eyes, then withdrew his gaze and respectfully handed the photo to Colonel Yamazaki. Colonel Yamazaki took the photo and began comparing it, then looked at a young man.
0:33:52|0:33:58|His subordinates immediately dragged the young man out, Colonel Yamazaki then opened another photo and ordered to take away a girl.
0:34:35|0:34:45|The soldiers dragged the two of them out directly, while [Liang Dong] stood by indifferently watching, and at this moment, [Helan Fang] who was kneeling on the ground was already in tears.
0:34:45|0:35:2|Colonel Yamazaki picked up another photo and flipped through them one by one. The Japanese soldiers pulled up the only remaining [Lan Fang] from the cell. Colonel Yamazaki compared the photos in front of him, and [Liang Dong] who was standing aside suddenly smiled. He walked slowly towards [Lan Fang] and slapped him directly, looking at him fiercely.
0:35:13|0:35:28|After Liang Dong finished speaking, he gave Lan Fang a hard push, and the Japanese soldiers took Lan Fang away. In the cell, only Liang Dong and Colonel Yamazaki remained. Liang Dong bowed deeply to him, but Colonel Yamazaki ignored him and left directly.
0:35:28|0:35:43|[Liang Dong] stood up straight, looking at the figure walking away with a pensive expression. [Lan Fang] emerged from the police station alone, her hands clenched into fists and held against her chest. Her clothes were soaked with blood, and large scabs clung to the corners of her mouth. She walked aimlessly down the street with vacant eyes.
0:35:43|0:35:59|At this moment, a military truck drove past her. [Lan Fang] looked at the truck, where her comrades were being held down by Japanese soldiers. The comrades were kneeling on the truck, with three Japanese soldiers pointing guns at them. Unable to bear it any longer, [Lan Fang] chased after the truck, tears streaming down her face, and shouted.
0:36:9|0:36:26|[Lan Fang] was shouting and chasing after the truck on the street, her companions on the truck looked at her in despair with their injuries. She looked at them and tears of self-blame streamed down her face. The cause of the whole incident was herself, now that she was saved, she had to let her companions die in her place. Guilt tormented her heart.
0:36:27|0:36:37|[Lan Fang] ran quickly, but she couldn't catch up with the truck. At this moment, [Liang Dong] also came out of the police station and ran towards [Lan Fang], embracing her tightly.
0:36:37|0:36:49|The truck slowly disappeared from Lin Xiang's sight. Lan Fang suddenly broke free from Liang Dong's embrace. The two looked at each other in silence. Lan Fang then slapped Liang Dong hard and cursed at him.
0:36:54|0:37:8|After Lan Fang finished scolding, she chased after the truck. Liang Dong, upon hearing these words, seemed to be frozen in place, unable to recover for a long time. It turned out that even if he saved Lan Fang, he couldn't change the image of himself in her heart.
0:37:8|0:37:25|After a while, tears filled his eyes, but stubbornly did not fall. [Liang Dong]'s pursed lips slowly opened, as if exhaling heavily to calm his emotions. The next day, on the deserted street, the comrade gave instructions to [Lan Fang], and a comrade sent by the superiors arrived.
0:37:34|0:37:50|[Lan Fang], who received the task, changed into an elegant long coat, drew her eyebrows in front of the mirror, and applied lipstick to her lips. After finishing her makeup, [Lan Fang] picked up a piece of paper with the words: "5:00 PM, Morning Light Photo Studio, No. 4, Lane 48, Fangbin Middle Road."
0:37:50|0:38:2|She memorized the content, then picked up the teapot, threw the note into the fireplace, and grabbed a handbag from the table to prepare to leave. Unexpectedly, as soon as she opened the door, Liang Dong was standing in front of the door with flowers.
0:38:5|0:38:18|[Lan Fang] took the flower wall from [Liang Dong] and threw it on the ground. She lifted her leg to leave, but [Liang Dong] grabbed her wrist. [Lan Fang] tried to break free, and the two arrived in front of some weeds. [Liang Dong] spoke.
0:38:18|0:38:36|They were all captured by the Japanese, and no one could save them. In a flash, the scene of [Liang Dong] tearing up [Lan Fang]'s photo appeared. [Lan Fang] stood in front of his companions' makeshift tent, with their previous words echoing in his ears.
0:38:51|0:38:58|[Lan Fang] took the flowers from Liang Dong's hands, squatted down and placed them in front of the tombstone, a tear sliding down her face.
0:39:5|0:39:14|After saying that, [Lan Fang] turned and left, leaving [Liang Dong] standing alone in the desolate and deserted grassland, with only a tree full of leaves standing beside him.
0:39:14|0:39:31|[Lan Fang] arrived at the Morning Light Studio as agreed. She looked at the signboard on the street, then walked to the door and knocked. After knocking for a while with no response, she cautiously pushed the door open and walked in, then closed the door behind her. The interior was arranged in an extremely artistic manner.
0:40:41|0:40:48|[Lan Fang] was pushed down to sit by [Big Cat], she took a deep breath and quietly watched the next move of [Big Cat].
0:41:7|0:41:19|[Lan Fang] nervously tidied her hair and clothes, [Lin Xiang] took out a ring from his pocket, held [Lan Fang]'s hand, and put the ring on her ring finger. [Big Cat] smiled knowingly as he watched.
0:41:30|0:41:35|Big Cat looked at Lan Fang's expression in the camera frame, which was very dull, and couldn't help but quip.
0:41:53|0:42:2|Unfortunately, when the photo came out, [Lan Fang] was still sitting expressionless, while [Lin Xiang] next to her was smiling, looking quite cheerful.
0:42:2|0:42:16|The two arrived at the residence of [Lin Xiang], who was tidying up the bed. He turned his head to look at [He Lan Fang]. At that moment, as [He Lan Fang] picked up the just poured water glass and prepared to turn around, she unexpectedly saw [Lin Xiang]. Upon seeing this, [Lin Xiang] softly spoke.
0:42:28|0:42:42|After speaking, [Lin Xiang] walked quietly towards the desk, holding a small wooden radio-like device in his arms. He then pushed open the door of the room, looked around, and gestured to [He Lan Fang] to be quiet.
0:42:44|0:42:54|Lin Xiang then walked out of the room, took off his slippers at the doorway, and walked barefoot up to the attic. Halfway there, he turned his head and nodded at Lan Fang.
0:42:55|0:43:6|[Lan Fang] watched him walk up the attic stairs, then turned back into the room and closed the door. Sitting on the bed inside the room, [Lan Fang] took off her coat, neatly folded it, and placed it at the foot of the bed.
0:43:6|0:43:18|In the attic, [Lin Xiang] put on his headphones and tuned in to the radio station. Holding a paper filled with words, he began to communicate messages to the outside world. And so, the two of them disguised as a married couple spent their first peaceful night together.
0:43:19|0:43:33|Early the next morning, [Lin Xiang] came down from the attic and returned to the room. Hearing the noise, [Lan Fang], who was sleeping in bed, quickly got up. Even though she had already slept, [Lan Fang] was still neatly dressed in the lining of her coat.
0:43:33|0:43:41|[Lin Xiang] placed the small wooden radio on the table, looked out the window, then walked to the bed, where [He Lan Fang] was gazing at his face.
0:43:44|0:43:49|At this moment, [Lin Xiang] pointed to the pillow on the bed and asked.
0:43:57|0:44:12|[Lin Xiang] walked towards another room with a pillow in his hand, and after [Lan Fang] saw him leave, she lay back on the bed. After a nap, [Lin Xiang] looked visibly refreshed. He was preparing food by the window when [Lan Fang], attracted by the aroma, walked over and asked.
0:44:15|0:44:20|[Lan Fang] picked up a pair of chopsticks, picked up a vegetable from the pot, and put it into her mouth.
0:45:45|0:45:51|[Lin Xiang] taught [He Lan Fang] and then went to the attic to teach [Chen Zimo] how to send telegrams.
0:45:57|0:46:13|[Big Cat] came to a clinic and asked the [doctor] to examine him. The [doctor] wrote a prescription, stamped it, and handed it to [Big Cat]. [Big Cat] looked at the prescription for a moment, then turned his head to look at rows of neatly arranged herbal medicine cabinets, each with a numbered label.
0:46:13|0:46:17|It compared the herbs on the prescription with the positions of the cabinets and obtained a series of numbers.
0:46:18|0:46:36|Upon returning to her residence, [Big Cat] wrote down the numbers on a piece of paper and cross-referenced them with a book to extract information. She wrote down the extracted information on another piece of paper, placed it in an envelope with the words "Morning Light Photo Studio," and then burned the paper with the numbers. Afterwards, she returned to the Morning Light Photo Studio.
0:46:39|0:46:42|Big Cat said to Lan Fang, who came to pick up the photos,
0:46:45|0:47:9|[Lan Fang] left with an envelope containing photos, walking briskly on the street, unaware that [Liang Dong] was following her. She got into a yellow cab, and just as [Liang Dong] was about to catch up, the seemingly drunk [Big Cat] intercepted her. In the midst of their struggle, [Lan Fang] had already boarded the car and left.
0:47:12|0:47:15|Big Cat, who was thrown to the ground by Liang Dong, complained.
0:47:32|0:47:48|In the street, a group of young people holding flags and handing out flyers to the passersby. With a whistle blowing, a group of law enforcement officers rushed out from various streets to stop the parade. Three female comrades, while fleeing onto a street, encountered [Liang Dong].
0:47:48|0:47:57|[Liang Dong] stretched out his arm, gesturing for them to come this way, then threw away the flags in their hands to ensure they wouldn't be caught before letting them go.
0:48:1|0:48:7|Several law enforcement officers arrived late, and [Liang Dong] impatiently pointed them in the completely opposite direction.
0:48:7|0:48:25|After they left, [Big Cat] sitting on the steps of the second-floor window gave him a thumbs-up. [Liang Dong] saw it and took off his sunglasses with a knowing smile. Amid the sound of firecrackers, the tailor shop officially opened. [Liang Dong] sat in the audience seats, silently watching [He Lanfang], with [Big Cat] sitting beside him.
0:48:28|0:48:45|[Liang Dong] turned his head to look at [Big Cat] without saying a word. Then, [Big Cat] handed half of his youtiao to [Liang Dong]. Taking the youtiao, [Liang Dong] stuffed it into his mouth eagerly, and the scene shifted to a magnificent hall.
0:48:45|0:48:58|On stage, two women in revealing clothes are striking poses, with [Masako Akiyama] seated in the second-floor gallery. [Qin Fengwu] and his family are seated in the adjacent gallery, [Qin Fengwu] turns his head, squeezes out a smile, and greets [Masako Akiyama].
0:48:59|0:49:7|[Lan Fang] and several other mistresses also arrived here. They sat in the audience seats below the stage, and one of the mistresses spoke up.
0:49:39|0:49:45|[Lan Fang] turned to look at the girl selling snacks, who turned out to be her friend, [Wan Bin].
0:49:55|0:50:8|He [Lan Fang] lowered her head and helplessly touched her hair. Wan Bin looked at her, and finally placed a bag of snacks in her hand. He [Lan Fang] looked at Wan Bin, wanting to speak but hesitating.
0:50:12|0:50:27|After speaking, the hands that were originally held by the two separated as Wan Bin left. He [Lan Fang] watched his departing figure, tears welling up in his eyes. He lowered his head, opened the snack package in his hand, took out a sunflower seed, and started cracking it in his mouth.
0:50:27|0:50:37|She paused for a moment, taking a slow breath to suppress the unease in her heart. Just then, Wan Bin, who had just been selling snacks, rushed to the stage and shouted loudly.
0:51:13|0:51:25|In pouring rain, [Lan Fang] walked out of the auditorium and onto the deserted street, getting drenched. She recalled the scene of Wan Bin being shot dead on stage just now, covering her face in agony with her hands.
0:51:25|0:51:34|She bent over and cried out loud without any reservation, scenes of working together with Wan Bin in the past flashed back in front of her eyes.
0:51:48|0:52:9|When Wan Bin died, he didn't even close his eyes. [Lan Fang] couldn't hold on any longer and her body fell to the ground. In the heavy rain, [Lan Fang] knelt on the ground, covering her mouth to breathe. [Lin Xiang] sat on the sofa in the residence reading the newspaper. [Lan Fang], with her hair scattered and tears on her face, appeared in front of him.
0:52:9|0:52:12|[Lin Xiang] quickly stepped forward to inquire upon seeing the situation.
0:53:59|0:54:2|[Lan Fang] throws the bag and jewelry on the ground.
0:54:14|0:54:19|[Lan Fang] bent down and picked up the leaflet from her bag, unfolding it in front of [Lin Xiang].
0:54:22|0:54:32|[Lin Xiang] took the flyer from [Lan Fang]'s hand, looked down at it for a moment, then turned his gaze to the excited [Lan Fang].
0:55:23|0:55:29|Lin Xiang looked at [Lan Fang], and his heart calmed down a bit. He whispered to her.
0:55:32|0:55:50|After speaking, he lowered his head, folded the leaflet in his hand, and placed it in [Lan Fang]'s hand. Then he bent down to pick up the scattered bags and jewelry on the ground. [Lan Fang] held the leaflet tightly, and her mood gradually calmed down. Late at night, [Lan Fang] arrived at the attic according to the time set by [Lin Xiang].
0:55:50|0:55:58|After closing the door to the attic, she walked deeper inside. After bending through a low doorway, she sat quietly next to [Lin Xiang].
0:56:0|0:56:13|Even though it was already 2 a.m., [Lin Xiang] was still working diligently. He wore headphones, with a paper filled with words in front of him, his eyes focused ahead, and his right hand tirelessly pressing the buttons on the radio.
0:56:14|0:56:24|Lan Fang watched the complex and dilapidated machine on the table, as well as Lin Xiang working diligently beside her, she lowered her head, lost in thought.
0:56:24|0:56:42|On this day, [Lan Fang] walked on the bustling street. Along the way, she ran into [Big Cat], who solemnly talked to her about the organization's discipline. [Lan Fang] held a small mirror to see if anyone was following her.
0:57:1|0:57:6|[Lan Fang] plays mahjong with Mrs. Fu during the day and spends the night in the attic with [Lin Xiang].
0:57:26|0:57:37|[Lin Xiang] took the water cup and patiently watched [He Lan Fang] explain the basic principles of the radio station. The two, who were originally unfamiliar, gradually became familiar and intimate in their daily lives.
0:57:55|0:58:9|On a rainy night, pedestrians hurried along the road. A man wearing a raincoat rode his bicycle quickly and stopped in front of the Morning Light Photo Studio. He threw the bike down and walked quickly into the house, taking out two rolls of film and saying to [Big Cat].
0:58:44|0:59:7|Masako Akiyama kicked Lin Xiang to the ground when he remained silent. Meanwhile, Big Cat held two overlapping rolls of film, recording the obtained information in numbers and then flipping through a book to find the corresponding Chinese characters. Lin Xiang spat out blood as Masako Akiyama ordered her men to torture him.
0:59:10|0:59:26|Two Japanese soldiers tied [Masako Akiyama] to a long bench, and [Qin Fengwu] slowly walked up to her. It turned out that after entering the photo studio, Masako accidentally stepped on an envelope with the words "Morning Light Photo Studio". After taking off Masako's shoes, [Qin Fengwu] said to [Lan Fang].
0:59:30|0:59:44|On the other side, [Big Cat] finally pieced together the information. After staring blankly for a few seconds, he quickly struck a match, set fire to the paper in front of him, and his panicked face was reflected in the flames.
0:59:44|0:59:57|The door of the Morning Light Photo Studio was suddenly kicked open, and [Qin Fengwu] rushed in. After entering, he looked around, then picked up the trash can from the floor and placed it on the table. Seeing the burnt traces of paper inside, he drew a conclusion.
1:0:9|1:0:26|[Lan Fang] watched the anxious figure of [Big Cat] and felt a sense of foreboding. As [Big Cat] arrived at the restaurant to find [Lin Xiang], suddenly a large group of men in black rushed in from outside. [Big Cat] ran off, with [Qin Fengwu] shouting loudly behind him.
1:0:29|1:0:43|Big Cat runs frantically in the stairwell, pushing open a door to find a hiding spot, but the men in black don't give him the chance. The scene shifts to Lin Xiang still reminding a wealthy lady Liang Dong, when Lan Fang arrives at the restaurant.
1:0:48|1:1:2|[Big Cat] ran into the lobby of the restaurant, only to be surrounded by men in black holding guns. After fending off a few of them with his phone, he jumped directly from the second floor to the lobby on the first floor. [Cen Zimo], who was playing the piano in the lobby, stood up to observe the situation after hearing the commotion.
1:1:2|1:1:15|Seeing his companion being surrounded, he quickly stepped forward, but was deterred by the gaze of [Big Cat]. Several men in black pressed [Big Cat] to the ground, with gun barrels pointed at his chest. [Big Cat] grabbed the gun and pulled the trigger at one of them.
1:1:18|1:1:27|A loud noise startled [Lan Fang] and [Lin Xiang]. Inside the hotel lobby, chaos ensued as everyone scrambled around, with [Big Cat] lying on the ground after wrestling with the heavy cart.
1:1:35|1:1:52|[Big Cat], despite being seriously injured, still picked up the gun and fought with them as everyone ran towards the door. [Lan Fang] walked against the crowd towards the lobby, while [Lin Xiang] approached the source of the sound. After shooting down a person, [Big Cat] covered his abdominal wound and met [Lin Xiang] at the corner of the stairs.
1:1:52|1:1:57|She looked at [Lin Xiang] and shook her head silently, while [Lin Xiang] nodded with red eyes.
1:2:4|1:2:20|As soon as the words fell, he started grappling with the approaching [Masako Akiyama]. [Lin Xiang] said to the just arrived [Lan Fang], [Masako Akiyama] kicked towards [Big Cat], then struck her leg heavily on her shoulder, giving her no breathing time, and directly kicked her in the face.
1:2:20|1:2:26|Big Cat fell from the second floor to the first floor, leaving Lin Xiang and Lan Fang in shock as they watched the scene.
1:2:32|1:2:39|[Liang Dong] swaggered into the lobby, pointing his gun towards the second floor, smiling as he nodded towards [Masako Akiyama].
1:2:54|1:3:14|Big Cat slowly stood up, with Masako Akiyama and Qin Fengwu on the second floor watching with great interest. Liang Dong stared sharply at Big Cat, who was weakly unable to stand straight. Big Cat asked Liang Dong to shoot, but Liang Dong remained silent. Big Cat looked at the scene.
1:3:24|1:3:38|Liang Dong was forced by him, his eyes bloodshot, not pulling the trigger of the gun. Suddenly, Big Cat's hands, covered in blood, pulled Liang Dong's gun to his chest. Then, he smiled at Lin Xiang and Lan Fang, and pulled the trigger of the gun.
1:3:40|1:3:57|In an instant, blood splattered onto [Liang Dong]'s face. [Lin Xiang] quickly covered [Lan Fang]'s eyes with his hand, leaving everyone present in shock. Big Cat's body gradually lost its vitality, falling backwards with his face covered in blood, while [Liang Dong] remained in a state of shock.
1:3:57|1:4:13|He watched as Big Cat fell, the handgun in his hand slipping to the ground. Inside the lobby, the huge fish tank suddenly shattered, water splashing onto Big Cat's body. [Lin Xiang] watched this scene, gritting his teeth, the atmosphere making him tremble all over, his eyes bloodshot.
1:4:13|1:4:25|But in order to conceal his identity, he had to watch his companions sacrifice themselves helplessly. Even with her eyes covered, [Lan Fang] could still sense the final outcome just by hearing the gunshots, without witnessing the bloodiest scene.
1:4:26|1:4:42|His hand rested on [Lin Xiang]'s hand, and his silent tears made his whole body tremble. [Cen Zimo] frowned helplessly. At night, it started to rain heavily under the sky, and there were no idle people on the streets.
1:4:42|1:4:52|Outside the restaurant, staff were carrying out bodies and loading them onto a truck, including the body of Big Cat. [Lin Xiang] stood in the shadows with an umbrella, observing their movements.
1:4:53|1:5:8|After the staff finished playing with the bodies, they covered the back of the truck and drove to a dilapidated and deserted building. They stood on the truck and casually threw the bodies to the ground, gradually forming a small hill of bodies.
1:5:9|1:5:26|[Liang Dong] returned home and washed his face in the water tank. He remembered what happened during the day, feeling guilty inside and involuntarily retching. His mother heard the sound and came over. [Liang Dong] asked her,
1:6:8|1:6:25|Liang Dong couldn't help but hug his mother's thigh and cried loudly as he listened to her words. On the other side, Lin Xiang followed the truck to where many bodies were lying, with Big Cat lying on top of them. Lin Xiang put down his umbrella, stood in the pouring rain, and slowly walked towards the bodies.
1:6:25|1:6:32|He remembered the scene today when [Big Cat] sacrificed himself and refused help from his companions. [Lin Xiang] looked down slowly at [Big Cat]'s body.
1:6:33|1:6:51|[Big Cat] flipped over on his body and eventually found a piece of cloth in the pocket on his chest. He clenched the cloth, hands trembling as he looked at the face of [Big Cat] who would never wake up again. After a while, [Lin Xiang], in order not to miss any clues, continued to search on [Big Cat]'s body.
1:6:51|1:6:57|While searching, [Lin Xiang] suddenly lost control of his emotions, lying on [Big Cat]'s body, unable to recover for a long time.
1:6:58|1:7:15|After making sure there were no clues overlooked, she returned to her residence with a heavy heart. She changed her clothes, then took a basin of clean water and washed the piece of cloth found in the body. [Lin Xiang] cried as she cleaned the cloth, on which were printed the words "East Wind Rain" and "Pearl".
1:7:16|1:7:27|He recalled the scene of his first meeting with [Big Cat], and the memories of [Big Cat] playing mahjong with [He Lanfang], everything was so clear, as if it happened just yesterday.
1:7:27|1:7:42|[Lan Fang] sat in front of the sewing machine, staring blankly. On top of it was the sweater she knitted for [Big Cat], but unfortunately, [Big Cat] would never have the chance to wear it again. [Lin Xiang] looked at the distraught [Lan Fang], then softly said to her,
1:7:50|1:8:6|Lan Fang didn't answer directly, but walked out of the room. Cen Zimo glanced at Lin Xiang, then followed Lan Fang out. On the street, a Japanese radio signal vehicle was driving by, while Lin Xiang went up to the attic.
1:8:6|1:8:12|He put on the headphones, turned on the radio, and then, referring to the note, transmitted the information he had obtained to the outside world.
1:8:31|1:8:41|As soon as the words fell, Masako Akiyama saw the city in front of her being divided into blackout zones. Lin Xiang, who was sending a telegram, and Liang Dong, who was lying at home, had no idea what was going on.
1:8:41|1:8:54|After a while, the power came back on. Sensing trouble, [Liang Dong] got up, grabbed his clothes, and left the room. Meanwhile, [Lin Xiang] was passing on information in the attic. The indicator lights on the radio were flashing rapidly, indicating that the situation was unusually urgent.
1:8:55|1:9:6|The Japanese army's mobile radio signal vehicle is patrolling every street, with Japanese soldiers conducting urgent searches on the vehicle. [Lin Xiang] senses the danger and pretends to be calm as he sends a telegram from the attic.
1:9:41|1:9:59|Masako Akiyama smirked evilly and ordered her subordinates to pass on the message that the underground radio station appeared in the rental area, calling for other units to cross-locate. A large number of Japanese soldiers rushed to Lin Xiang's residence, while Lin Xiang was still passing on important information in the attic. Our soldiers in the distance saluted the leader.
1:10:8|1:10:29|Qian Zimo and [Lan Fang] looked at the beams of light in the residence. After Cen Zimo finished speaking, he hurried to the tailor shop. [Lan Fang] followed closely behind. At this moment, several military trucks had arrived at the entrance of the tailor shop heading north. The Japanese soldiers on top opened a huge searchlight, illuminating [Lin Xiang]'s face through the window.
1:10:29|1:10:40|A large number of Japanese soldiers with guns rushed into the tailor shop. [Cen Zimo] and [Lan Fang] were running wildly on the street. [Lin Xiang] finished sending the final telegram in the attic, then burned the paper in a small cup.
1:10:45|1:11:3|The leader held the telegram handed over by the soldier, which read, "Comrade, farewell," signed by [Liu Yang]. All the surrounding soldiers stood up mourning, and the whole room was filled with sadness. The Japanese soldiers were looting the tailor shop, while [He Lanfang] and [Cen Zimo] stood at a distance, watching the scene with heartache.
1:11:3|1:11:11|[Lin Xiang] poured the ashes of burnt paper into water and drank it. Then he proceeded to dismantle the parts of the radio.
1:11:37|1:11:53|The Japanese soldiers handed over the captured radio transmitter to their leader. [Lin Xiang] saw the situation and his eyes became even more determined. [Liang Dong] rushed to [Lan Fang]'s tailor shop, only to find it sealed with a notice. He stood at the door, stunned, lost in thought.
1:11:54|1:12:16|Inside the headquarters of the Japanese Navy Special Landing Force, there are two rows of Japanese soldiers standing in the courtyard. Inside the room, [Lin Xiang] is shirtless, his body suspended in the air with his hands hanging on iron pads. Japanese soldiers pick up two long electric steel rods and press them against [Lin Xiang]'s body. He is electrocuted, trembling all over and crying out.
1:12:18|1:12:26|When Lin Xiang didn't tell the truth, the Japanese soldiers picked up a cushion and started hitting him, while Qin Fengwu fearlessly held a box.
1:12:57|1:13:14|Qin Fengwu placed the box on the torture table and opened it. Inside, there were rolls of linen, with an iron lotus handle. He picked up the lotus handle and slowly walked to Lin Xiang, then scratched the iron petal tip on Lin Xiang's body, one after another.
1:13:15|1:13:27|[Lin Xiang]'s body is now a bloody mess. Next, [Qin Fengwu] casually throws the lotus handle into the box, then picks up white granules and sprinkles them onto [Lin Xiang]'s body, the white granules sticking to the flesh and blood.
1:13:27|1:13:39|At this moment, [Qin Fengwu] picked up the linen cloth and placed it on [Lin Xiang]'s wound, using the lotus handle to stick the wound and cloth together. Lin Xiang gasped in pain. Seeing that he was still stubborn, [Qin Fengwu] spoke up.
1:13:45|1:13:55|Lin Xiang also fainted temporarily because he couldn't hold on. On the other side, Cen Zimo, feeling regretful because Lin Xiang was captured by the Japanese army, said to [Lan Fang].
1:14:3|1:14:6|Cen Zimo went out and met Liang Dong. Cen Zimo widened his eyes and asked Liang Dong.
1:14:37|1:14:44|[Lan Fang] ran past two people and rushed out, only to encounter a car on the way. Chen Zimo quickly stepped forward and asked.
1:14:54|1:15:3|Learning that the woman laughing in the car is the confidante of Qin Fengwu, Cen Zimo gestured to Liang Dong, who then smiled and approached.
1:15:13|1:15:19|[Cen Zimo] imitates [Lin Xiang]'s Morse code in a hidden room, and the Japanese army also detects the signal.
1:15:40|1:15:52|The Japanese radio station commander bluntly stated that the wrong person was caught, [Masako Akiyama] shouted that it must be him. [Lan Fang] came to [Masako Akiyama]'s office in gorgeous attire.
1:15:59|1:16:2|Masako Akiyama took the note handed to her by Lan Fang without saying a word.
1:16:17|1:16:30|[Lan Fang] picked up the cigarette on the table, lit it, and started to exhale smoke. [Masako Akiyama] stood up from her seat, walked around the table to [Lan Fang]'s side. Taking a puff of the cigarette, [Lan Fang] turned to her and spoke.
1:16:44|1:17:5|Zhu Zong, Tong You, Shengqi, [He Lan Fang] finished speaking and blew a smoke ring, [Masako Akiyama] brought her to the cell. From a distance, [Lan Fang] saw [Lin Xiang] hanging in the center of the cell. She ran up excitedly, but was still startled when she saw the injuries on [Lin Xiang].
1:17:5|1:17:9|She calmed down for a moment, then whispered to [Lin Xiang].
1:17:16|1:17:31|[Lan Fang] spoke excitedly, [Qin Fengwu] stepped forward, holding her arms to calm her down. Tears glistened in [Lan Fang]'s eyes as she glared fiercely. Then, [Qin Fengwu] took a glass of water and splashed it on the still unconscious [Lin Xiang].
1:17:31|1:17:34|She stared at [Lin Xiang] intently, then whispered.
1:17:43|1:17:59|Qin Fengwu uncovered the wet linen on Lin Xiang's body, causing Lan Fang to scream in fear. Lin Xiang looked at Qin Fengwu with determination, but when he still refused to speak, Qin Fengwu reached out and removed the remaining linen from Lin Xiang's body.
1:18:2|1:18:10|[Lin Xiang] winced in pain, sweat covering his entire face. He looked at [Lan Fang] with a look of endurance, tears streaming down her face.
1:18:21|1:18:38|Please [Qin Fengwu] rolled his eyes, turned around and looked behind him with an impatient expression on his face. He threw the piece of cloth in his hand on the ground, then turned back and began to uncover the pieces of cloth on [Lin Xiang]'s body one by one. [Lan Fang] immediately tried to stop him.
1:18:38|1:18:45|The Japanese army announced that they have connected to the Taigong Pier and handed the phone to [Masako Akiyama]. [Lan Fang] quickly stepped forward to speak on the phone.
1:18:51|1:18:53|[Masako Akiyama] snatched the phone again.
1:19:3|1:19:9|Qin Fengwu tears off a piece of burlap from [Lin Xiang]'s body, and [Lan Fang] quickly catches it.
1:19:15|1:19:27|Masako Akiyama interrupted him, then looked at the dying Lin Xiang, who was tortured beyond recognition, his eyes unfocused. Everyone's gaze was on him at this moment, as he uttered a few numbers.
1:19:52|1:19:56|Qin Fengwu turned around and walked to the table, shaking the telephone in front of her.
1:20:13|1:20:19|Upon hearing the cries for help, Qin Fengwu clearly panicked, holding the phone and continuing to listen to what Liang Dong was saying.
1:20:25|1:20:40|Qin Fengwu turned to look at [Lin Xiang], who met his gaze with determination. Meanwhile, after finishing the call, [Liang Dong] set down the phone, causing Qin Fengwu's concubine to stop her wailing. Outside the door, [Cen Zimo] and a foreigner were eating with Qin Fengwu's son.
1:20:40|1:20:49|Qin Fengwu stood in the cell, lost in thought. Before long, he walked towards [Lin Xiang] and started to curse loudly.
1:21:15|1:21:32|Masako Akiyama finished speaking, and both Qin Fengwu and [Lan Fang] showed different thoughts. A large number of Japanese soldiers came to the dock to search for goods, and Masako Akiyama and others stood on the second-floor platform. At this moment, Qin Fengwu and [Lan Fang] were very nervous, but after searching for a while, the Japanese soldiers didn't find anything.
1:21:32|1:21:41|[Masako Akiyama] asked in a deep voice, [Qin Fengwu]'s expression was indescribable, [Masako Akiyama] felt something was wrong, holding a knife against [Lan Fang]'s neck.
1:21:53|1:22:14|Masako Akiyama put down the long knife, then walked downstairs towards the direction of the goods, followed closely by Qin Fengwu and Lan Fang. The Japanese soldiers opened a can of gasoline, Masako Akiyama held the long knife and stabbed it into the opening of the oil drum, then pulled out the knife and lit it. The knife was instantly engulfed in flames. At this moment, Lan Fang spoke up.
1:22:14|1:22:18|Masako Akiyama glanced at Lan Fang, then turned to Qin Fengwu and said.
1:22:25|1:22:44|Masako Akiyama gave the order and then turned away from the dock. At night, on a narrow road, Cen Zimo was driving a small truck carrying goods slowly. Lin Xiang lay weakly in the truck, while Lan Fang held a water bottle for him to drink. Lin Xiang gazed affectionately at Lan Fang and said
1:23:6|1:23:25|The two looked at each other affectionately, with unspoken feelings in their eyes. [Lin Xiang] raised his left hand slightly, and [Lan Fang] quickly held it back. Her bright eyes stared at [Lin Xiang], then slowly lay down beside him. At this moment, their eyes did not leave each other, while the car continued to drive slowly.
1:23:25|1:23:29|After gazing deeply at each other, [Lin Xiang] slowly spoke.
1:23:51|1:23:57|[Masako Akiyama], sitting in the chair, was so angry that her face twisted upon hearing these words.
1:24:13|1:24:23|In the hail of bullets, the car is riddled with bullet holes. [Qin Fengwu] lies on the side with wide eyes, no longer breathing, and her son is nowhere to be found.
1:24:24|1:24:36|The beautiful scenery along the road is peaceful at this moment, as if nothing has ever happened. In the city of Shanghai, the Japanese army has posted wanted posters of [Lin Xiang] and [Lan Fang] on the streets.
1:24:54|1:25:13|Lin Xiang looked at Liang Dong, who was speaking, without answering. After Liang Dong finished speaking, he lowered his head and fell into contemplation. Lin Xiang looked at his expression and slowly asked.
1:25:37|1:25:45|[Liang Dong] listened to these words, then glanced subtly at [Lin Xiang]. The scene shifted to a beautiful lakeside.
1:26:13|1:26:26|In the photo is a skinny man, the top leader of the Nanjing puppet government. Huizi risked her life to take a picture of this man with a camera. [Lin Xiang] turned and entered a room.
1:26:56|1:27:10|[Lin Xiang] is in the house, passing on the intelligence to the superior. Inside the city of Shanghai, many papers scatter in the sky and slowly fall into the hands of [Liang Dong]. The papers bear a photo of Wang Jingwei on a sickle, resembling a devil. Below it is written:
1:27:14|1:27:21|[Masako Akiyama] lay on the luxurious sofa, puffing on a long cigarette holder, blowing smoke rings. The latest news was being broadcast on the radio.
1:27:51|1:28:10|In the bustling street, the Japanese army is checking the passing civilians. On the big truck next to them, there are many Japanese soldiers ready at any moment. The street is filled with wanted posters of many people, and all the shops on the street are closed. A foreigner is driving a big truck filled with large iron barrels slowly approaching.
1:28:10|1:28:15|After driving the car to a checkpoint, the Japanese soldiers raised their hands to stop the vehicle, then approached and asked.
1:28:22|1:28:29|With a wave of the Japanese commander's hand, a group of men under him stabbed the wine barrels on the car with knives, causing [Qin Fengwu], who was hiding inside the barrel, to scream.
1:28:37|1:28:43|The foreigner saw the situation and immediately pulled the handbrake, started the truck, and crashed through the fence.
1:28:50|1:29:8|The truck is speeding down the street, pedestrians around are dodging. [Lin Xiang] and [Cen Zimo], who are hiding in the barrels, come out. Japanese soldiers start shooting at them. [Lin Xiang] and [Cen Zimo] push the barrels off the truck, and the barrels roll down the ground towards the Japanese soldier riding a motorcycle.
1:29:8|1:29:15|The Japanese soldiers were thrown into chaos by this incident, and the truck carrying several Japanese officers crashed into the iron barrel on the side of the street.
1:29:31|1:29:38|Upon receiving the news, [Masako Akiyama] immediately headed towards the outskirts. Lin Xiang and the others arrived at the abandoned factory, where the foreigner opened the iron gate.
1:30:2|1:30:8|The group was inspecting the plane when they didn't notice that [Masako Akiyama] was approaching with someone. [Lin Xiang] asked the foreigner.
1:30:17|1:30:22|[Lin Xiang] looked at the drunken foreigner, pondered for a moment, then turned away.
1:30:41|1:31:0|After speaking, [Lin Xiang] stood on the plane and reached out his hand to [Lan Fang]. Tears welled up in [Lan Fang]'s eyes as she looked at [Lin Xiang] for a long time without saying a word. Then she nodded slightly, held [Lin Xiang]'s hand, and the two female comrades finally boarded the plane as a large number of Japanese soldiers stormed through the abandoned factory, smashing the gate to pieces.
1:31:0|1:31:14|[Lin Xiang] held [Lan Fang]'s hand and rubbed it, the two looked at each other, their eyes showing reluctance. [Lan Fang] nodded slightly at [Lin Xiang], after a moment of tenderness, [Lin Xiang] no longer hesitated, but turned and left.
1:31:14|1:31:17|[Lan Fang]'s eyes followed [Lin Xiang], eventually shedding tears.
1:31:19|1:31:36|The plane is about to start, [Lin Xiang] and [Cen Zimo] open the front door, and the foreigner starts the plane in reverse. At this moment, [Masako Akiyama] leads a large number of Japanese soldiers to surround them. The plane slowly drives on the abandoned street, and suddenly turns into a large Japanese truck at the corner.
1:31:40|1:31:54|[Lin Xiang] and [Cen Zimo] were about to leave, but they ran into the Japanese army just as they stepped out of the factory. Bullets were flying densely towards them, with explosions one after another. With their agile skills, [Lin Xiang] and [Cen Zimo] managed to escape unscathed.
1:31:54|1:32:5|On the other side, the Japanese army mounted a heavy machine gun on a truck, crazily shooting at the plane approaching the camp. Just as the two were about to collide, the plane suddenly made a turn and veered onto another street.
1:32:6|1:32:23|The Japanese soldiers were close behind, continuously shooting at them. With no way out ahead, the foreigners driving the plane remained calm and flew straight into the wall. [Masako Akiyama] watched the scene in front of her, kicked her own driver out of the seat, and started driving herself.
1:32:28|1:32:39|Masako Akiyama drove the car expressionlessly and quickly towards the plane, hitting the rear wheel of the aircraft. Lan Fang and Huizi turned to look at the already crazy Masako Akiyama, feeling a sense of impending doom.
1:32:39|1:32:47|After several impacts, the bumper of the vehicle driven by [Masako Akiyama] hooked onto the metal piece at the back of the plane.
1:32:50|1:33:0|[Masako Akiyama] stepped on the brake, and the vehicle came to a stop, causing the plane behind to also stop due to being hooked from the rear.
1:33:17|1:33:22|Pierre, the pilot, happily agreed upon hearing this, then ran towards the Japanese military vehicle, sat in the driver's seat, stepped on the gas pedal to start the vehicle. Lan Fang and Huizi, seeing this, quickly sat down in the plane.
1:33:30|1:33:47|[Lin Xiang] is driving the vehicle, pushing the plane forward. After [Masako Akiyama] gets up from the ground, she quickly runs to the vehicle. Then with a leg up, she climbs onto the car. She then grabs [Lin Xiang]'s neck with both hands. [Lan Fang] turns her head to look at this scene, her eyes filled with worry.
1:33:47|1:33:50|[Lin Xiang] held the steering wheel with one hand and picked up the sharp knife from the cushion with the other hand.
1:33:51|1:34:6|He wedged the dagger on the throttle, a copper edge leaped up and tripped behind [Masako Akiyama]. The two were fighting behind the vehicle, as the vehicle moved, the front wheel of the plane gradually lifted, as if ready to take off at any time.
1:34:7|1:34:22|Masako Akiyama quickly removed the dagger stuck in the accelerator, causing the vehicle to slow down and the front wheel of the plane to touch the ground. Lin Xiang stepped over and broke the dagger, then pulled down the throttle, and the vehicle continued to move forward.
1:34:23|1:34:37|Masako Akiyama and Lin Xiang were engaged in a fierce fight, as a large number of Japanese troops gathered here from elsewhere, preparing to ambush the aircraft. Cen Zimo also ran over from another street, his eyes shining brightly as he pondered what to do.
1:34:38|1:34:47|At this moment, an enemy's large truck approached. [Cen Zimo] didn't hesitate, climbed onto the truck, and kicked the Japanese soldier holding the machine gun off.
1:34:52|1:35:11|[Liang Dong] rode over on a motorcycle to clear the way in front of the plane. He used a handgun to take out all the approaching Japanese soldiers. The motorcycle became uncontrollable due to gunfire, and [Liang Dong] eventually had to jump off. On the other side, after [Cen Zimo] took out the two people in the driver's cabin of the car, he also jumped off to save his life.
1:35:11|1:35:27|Masako Akiyama is fighting with [Lin Xiang], holding a knife. Lin Xiang dodges by bending over, then gets kicked in front of the car's window and knocked out. In order to continue kicking him, Masako Akiyama smashes the glass with one kick. Seizing the opportunity, Lin Xiang tightly grabs onto her leg.
1:35:27|1:35:33|At this moment, the plane slowly lifts off the ground, gradually disconnecting from the vehicles, and then flies towards the sky.
1:35:34|1:35:48|Lin Xiang watched as the vehicle was about to crash into the wall, so he bent Masako Akiyama's leg and then jumped out of the car and rolled to the ground. Masako Akiyama, with her leg broken, couldn't react in time and crashed into the wall with the vehicle, then fell into the sea.
1:35:56|1:36:11|Three people watched as the plane slowly disappeared from view, supporting each other and feeling the relief of surviving the ordeal. In the reflection of the setting sun, their silhouettes appeared particularly majestic. On September 2, 1945, Japan was signing the instrument of unconditional surrender, and the scene gradually darkened.
1:36:11|1:36:24|When the light came on, [Lin Xiang] sat in a simple room with the curtains drawn, making the room dim. The only light was on the table behind [Lin Xiang], who sat in front of it wearing headphones, fingers pressing the radio, sending a telegram to [He Lanfang].
1:36:51|1:37:10|The camera slowly pulls towards the window, the room that was originally covered by curtains suddenly becomes bright. Looking out through the window, the people on the street are all setting off firecrackers to celebrate. This scene is dedicated to the unknown heroes on the hidden front line, as well as all those who have fought for a new life.
