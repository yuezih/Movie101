0:3:0|0:3:16|He approached the woman, took out a lipstick and drew something on her face. The two quickly pulled [Xiao Bo] away for evacuation, while [Tong Tong] hurriedly took the guitar and the woman's face suddenly showed a cross.
0:3:52|0:3:57|Fireworks for the New Year burst in the sky, and the sports car suddenly stops in the suburbs across the bridge.
0:4:6|0:4:28|[A Jie] got off the car and said anxiously, while [Tong Tong] looked around. The screen went black, marking the end of the opening sequence of the movie "The Miracles of the Namiya General Store", based on the original work by Keigo Higashino.

0:4:58|0:5:14|Three of them abandoned the car and walked to find the way. [A Jie] ran in the front, [Xiao Bo] carried a bag and also held the bag of the tied woman, while [Tong Tong] followed closely with a guitar. As they got closer to the intersection, the number of houses decreased, and the nearby buildings were separated by small crossroads, all looking a bit dilapidated.
0:5:14|0:5:34|At the T-junction stands a two-story old building, which serves as both a shop and a residence. The house is not big, with colorful advertisements pasted on the rolling shutter of the shop. Faintly visible on the signboard are the words "grocery store", giving the impression that it is uninhabited. The three of them stop in front of the shop door and look around. [Tong Tong] scratches her head and asks,
0:5:40|0:6:1|Three of them arrived at the front of the store, looking up at the sign. The sign read "Unnamed Variety Store". [Tong Tong] walked to the side with a guitar on her back, while [A Jie] noticed the protruding mailbox on the wall. He pulled it out and found it empty. [Tong Tong] turned into the alley next to the house alone. [A Jie] picked up his phone and checked the time, the screen showed 23:58, with a screensaver of a photo of the three of them.
0:6:1|0:6:26|[Tong Tong] circled around to the back door, where there was a milk box. She signaled for the other two to come over. [Xiao Bo] picked up the lock on the gate, checked it, and then reached into his bag. Meanwhile, [A Jie] picked up a brick from the side of the road. Looking awkward, [A Jie] held up the brick as [Xiao Bo] pushed open the gate. Inside, there was another wooden door, which [Xiao Bo] took tools out of his bag to unlock while [Tong Tong] kept watch. The old wooden door was finally opened.
0:6:26|0:6:52|[Tong Tong] stepped up the stairs and entered first, [A Jie] poked his head in and asked, then he also walked in, the wooden floor creaked. [Tong Tong] lifted the door curtain and looked inside, what came into view was an old display window and old shelves. [Xiao Bo] put away his tools and looked up, at this moment the full moon was right in the sky, he paced with one foot next to the other, as if measuring the distance. The sudden sound of a clock scared [A Jie], the source of the sound was an old-fashioned grandfather clock. [A Jie] mocked [Tong Tong].
0:6:54|0:7:1|At this moment, the clock points to midnight, [Tong Tong] fiercely pats [A Jie] on the back, and [Xiao Bo] also walks in and gives [A Jie] a pat.
0:7:3|0:7:25|[A Jie] patted the mailbox, then rang the bell above it. [Xiao Bo] saw the calendar on the wall suddenly calling for companions. [A Jie] took out his phone, there was no electricity in the house. [Xiao Bo] lit several candles. [Tong Tong] asked while pressing her forehead,
0:7:44|0:7:58|The bell on the wall suddenly rang, and a folded piece of paper dropped into the letter box. [Tong Tong] stood up and walked quickly towards the letter box. [A Jie] hesitated before standing up, and [Tong Tong] boldly reached out to take the letter from the envelope. The three of them gathered around the letter.
0:8:6|0:8:20|[Tong Tong] first opened the door and looked around, then ran towards the front door. [Tong Tong] hesitated for a moment, then bumped into [Xiao Bo] with her elbow.
0:8:33|0:8:41|[A Jie] runs outside to observe the surroundings. From the gentle slope, he can see the lights of many households in the distance, but there is no one around him.
0:8:58|0:9:17|[A Jie] sighed with his back to the store, then turned to glance at it. He was surprised to see the grocery store gradually lighting up under the moonlight, as if it were enveloped in an aurora. [A Jie] blinked in disbelief as the entire grocery store seemed to be glowing with a moonlight-like radiance. The bright yellow title of "The Comfort Store" gradually appeared in front of the house.
0:9:19|0:9:28|[Tong Tong] picked up the old newspaper on the table, with a photo of an old man and a grocery store in the center, and the title next to the photo read "The Comfort Store".
0:10:16|0:10:21|[A Jie] lay heavily on the sofa in the inner room, the wall clock still pointing to midnight.
0:10:31|0:10:39|Tong Tong, who was leaning on the table, looked up and asked Xiao Bo. Xiao Bo glanced at her, and Tong Tong lowered her eyes and whispered,
0:11:24|0:11:35|[Tong Tong] closed her eyes in silence and lay on the table, [A Jie] put the letter in the milk box, [A Jie] opened the door curtain and walked into the room, [Tong Tong] and [Xiao Bo] hurriedly approached, staring at him together.
0:11:41|0:11:49|[Tong Tong] took out an envelope with the signature "Musician of the Small Town" on it, while the milk box was empty.
0:12:14|0:12:39|[A Jie] went out again to put the letter in the milk box, with [Tong Tong] following him. They hid behind some abandoned furniture not far away, staring intently at the milk box. The sound startled [A Jie], who cowered in fear. [Xiao Bo] raised his hand to show them the new letter, and the two hurriedly rushed forward to open the milk box, only to find it empty again.
0:12:51|0:12:59|[A Jie] quickly rushed to the coffee table, emptied the contents of the woman's bag onto the table, and impatiently threw down the empty wallet.
0:13:10|0:13:34|[Tong Tong] held onto the window frame, watching [A Jie] leave. The night market outside was bustling. [A Jie] raised his collar to cover his face as he entered the convenience store and bought a bunch of snacks. He casually glanced at the electronic clock on the wall, which showed 00:08. Puzzled, he blinked and then searched for an unnamed grocery store on his phone at the store entrance, finding a post on a forum.
0:13:34|0:13:55|The announcement stated that the consultation window of the Nameless Grocery Store will be resurrected from the early morning of January 1, 2018. Friends who have consulted the grocery store in the past and received a reply are requested to submit a letter to inform whether the reply at that time has affected your life. We hope everyone will speak frankly, just like back then. Suddenly,
0:13:55|0:14:12|The phone screen automatically goes black. Despite pressing the home button, [A Jie] gets no response. He carries snacks back to the grocery store, where [Tong Tong] and [Xiao Bo], who were leaning on the table, suddenly stand up. [Xiao Bo] quickly opens a pack of cookies.
0:15:17|0:15:27|[Tong Tong] and [Xiao Bo] wrote another letter and put it in the milk box. When they opened the box again, the letter was still there. [Tong Tong] said to [Xiao Bo],
0:15:29|0:15:41|After silently reciting three numbers, Xiao Bo and Tong Tong opened the milk carton, only to find the letter missing. They looked at each other in shock, when suddenly the bell rang and another letter dropped from the mailbox.
0:16:38|0:16:52|[Tong Tong] completely ignored [A Jie], picked up a pen and wrote a reply. She looked at the letter in her hand, sighed helplessly, then walked out of the house and closed the back door. Glancing at the envelope in her hand, she opened the milk box lid and stuffed the letter inside.
0:16:55|0:17:18|As the letter slowly falls into the milk box, time quickly rewinds, the mottled paint inside the box is restored to its original state, and the gaps in the wooden boards become seamless. Chapter One: "Musician in the Small Town". Someone opens the milk box, and a man with pointed hair reaches in and takes out an envelope.
0:17:28|0:17:41|In 1990 Beijing, [Qin Lang] dressed up, holding a guitar, walked out of the door. Outside the door, someone was washing up by the tap. This is a large courtyard where young drifters live.
0:17:45|0:17:51|A curly-haired young man approaches the girl,
0:18:39|0:18:44|A few young people are rehearsing a play outside the door, [Qin Lang] walks out of the gate pushing his bicycle.
0:18:55|0:19:10|Next to the gate, an old lady kept asking the man who was painting. [Qin Lang] rode his bike through the alleyways, passing by Tiananmen Square. Beside him, a man with glasses also rode a bike with a child placed on the crossbar of the bike. Inside the recording studio, the producer was shouting into the microphone.
0:20:19|0:20:52|[Qin Lang] suddenly took off his headphones, grabbed his guitar and rushed out of the recording studio, while the people inside laughed heartily. Outside the studio, [Qin Lang] smashed a beer bottle in front of the courtyard of a large residential compound, breathing heavily as he glanced sideways into the courtyard. A crowd gathered in front of the Beijing Exhibition Hall, with a poster above the entrance that read "Cui Jian Beijing Concert". Most people were wearing Cui Jian's iconic red five-pointed star hat and holding up posters, shouting Cui Jian's name loudly.
0:20:52|0:20:59|[Qin Lang] was squeezed against the glass door by the crowd, watching the crazy fans rushing towards Cui Jian for autographs. Cui Jian waved his hand at the door.
0:21:9|0:21:18|In 1993 Beijing, the male neighbor with a low ponytail shouted for [Qin Lang] at the door, then suddenly hugged him, released his hand and handed him a ticket.
0:21:47|0:21:56|The curly-haired youth, heartbroken, released the pigeons and lay on the roof.
0:22:6|0:22:32|[Qin Lang] answered the phone, his impatient expression subtly changing. He boarded the green train back to his hometown, watching the scenery outside the window quickly retreat. As the door opened at home, Qin Tian looked somewhat puzzled at [Qin Lang] outside, and his mother hurriedly greeted him.
0:22:39|0:23:12|Qin Tian helped his father sit up in bed, [Qin Lang] looked to the side, his father frowned and said, [Qin Lang] glanced at his father and then at his mother, in the room [Qin Lang] flipped through the music scores and lyrics he had collected, Qin Tian asked, [Qin Lang] turned his head without saying a word, Qin Tian watched him walk to the window, leaning against it, [Qin Lang] looked outside and let out a sigh.
0:23:21|0:23:39|[Qin Lang] walked unsteadily into the Huazi music store, where Huazi was organizing cassette tapes. When Huazi saw [Qin Lang], he was both surprised and delighted. He shook his shoulders to mimic an electric shock passing through him, and [Qin Lang] followed suit and high-fived him. The two of them clinked glasses in the store.
0:23:39|0:23:44|On the table were dozens of beer bottles. Hua Zi put down a beer bottle and asked. [Qin Lang] held the bottle and opened his mouth.
0:24:5|0:24:13|Hua Zi took the newspaper from the side and handed it to [Qin Lang]. [Qin Lang] looked at the newspaper and seemed to remember something, then asked.
0:24:29|0:24:36|[Qin Lang]'s smile gradually disappeared, he licked his lips thoughtfully, then came to the front door of the nameless grocery store, his eyes unfocused.
0:24:47|0:25:6|After writing the letter, he threw it into the mailbox and looked up at the sky. The video store was filled with tapes, CDs, and posters. Hua Zi and a young couple were engrossed in watching TV. A sign with big red letters on the shop's glass window read, "Specializing in the rental and sale of videotapes." [Qin Lang] was gently strumming the guitar on the steps outside the door.
0:25:6|0:25:24|The clock in the shop points to 8 o'clock, [Qin Lang] wearing a denim jacket, opens the milk box. He looks around, reaches in and takes out a letter, frowning as he reads unfamiliar words in the letter. At the dining table at home,
0:25:42|0:25:48|[Qin Lang] clinked glasses with his father, drank up the wine in one gulp, and his gaze shifted from side to side as he spoke.
0:26:10|0:26:19|The father angrily slammed the wine glass, his anger spilling all over the table. [Qin Lang] looked defiantly to the side, put down his chopsticks, and turned back to his room.
0:26:29|0:26:42|[Qin Lang] angrily crumpled the letter and threw it next to the tree roots. The emergency room door was lit with a red light. [Qin Lang] kicked his flip-flops as he passed through the bustling crowd at the hospital, rushing up the stairs three steps at a time, panting heavily as he ran down the corridor on the second floor.
0:26:42|0:26:51|Auntie Two patted Qin's mother when she saw [Qin Lang], who nodded towards Uncle Two. Qin Tian called [Qin Lang] aside and asked sternly.
0:26:59|0:27:16|Qin Tian helped his mother up from the bench, and she walked over to [Qin Lang] and glanced at him without saying a word. Qin Tian hugged his mother from behind as she looked out the window and quietly sobbed. The red light in the emergency room went out.
0:27:48|0:28:7|[Qin Lang] hid outside the ward and listened to the conversation, feeling extremely conflicted. Inside the bedroom, [Qin Lang] signed his name on the guitar with a white marker, as if bidding farewell to it. After finishing, he slowly raised his head, pursed his lips, and his eyes seemed to lose their sparkle. [Qin Lang] put the guitar into its case.
0:28:15|0:28:36|[Qin Lang] pulled out the letter from the grocery store's mailbox. The bell inside the house rang, and [Tong Tong] and the others quickly ran to the mailbox. [Qin Lang] seemed to hear a noise inside the house, so he withdrew his hand holding the letter. [Xiao Bo] lay down by the mailbox and looked outside. [Qin Lang] left half of the letter outside, closed the mailbox, leaned against the wall, and took out the harmonica from his pocket.
0:28:58|0:29:27|[Tong Tong] listened to the familiar melody, suddenly slapped [A Jie] on the arm. The harmonica sound passed by 1993's [Qin Lang] and arrived in the grocery store in 2018. [Qin Lang] played the harmonica devoutly, and at the end he stuffed the entire letter into the mailbox. The envelope passed through the tunnel of time, flashing green light, and fell into the letter basket below the receiving mailbox.
0:29:29|0:29:56|[Xiao Bo], who was guarding the mailbox, immediately picked up the envelope, unfolded the letter, and [Tong Tong] and [A Jie] gathered around to read the contents of the letter. After [Tong Tong] finished reading, looking somewhat shocked, [A Jie] nodded slightly. The three of them recalled the story of rebirth, feeling very low in spirits. In the silence, [Tong Tong] exclaimed and then hesitated to speak, with [Xiao Bo] continuing the conversation.
0:29:58|0:30:22|[Tong Tong] looked at [Xiao Bo], lowered her eyes and fell silent. The milk carton was opened again, with a note inside saying "For the small town musician". [Qin Lang] took out the note and looked at it in a daze. As he turned back, he heard a sound of vomiting. There was a drunken woman next to the utility pole. [Qin Lang] sat on the train back to Beijing, looking out the window.
0:30:51|0:31:16|Qin Lang's tears welled up in the corners of his eyes as his father stared straight at him. With red eyes, tears uncontrollably streamed down Qin Lang's face. In the darkness of the night, the train roared into the station. Three years later, in the Rainbow House, Qin Lang played the guitar and sang a song.
0:33:4|0:33:17|[Qin Lang] walked through the corridor with a guitar in his arms. As he was about to enter the room, he glanced at the rooftop and seemed to have seen something. He pushed open the door to the rooftop and walked slowly to [Zhang Weiwei]'s side.
0:33:20|0:33:35|[Zhang Weiwei] was leaning against the railing on the rooftop with her back to him, her left and right feet wearing socks of different colors. [Qin Lang] looked away from the socks, plucked the strings of the guitar, and it was only when [Zhang Weiwei] heard the sound of the guitar that she noticed [Qin Lang].
0:34:36|0:34:52|Qin Lang, who was sleeping, was suddenly awakened by screams. The Rainbow House was on fire, and Qin Lang hurriedly put on his pants as Zhang Yi rushed out of the fire with the child in her arms.
0:34:58|0:35:25|[Qin Lang] heard the cries for help, handed the guitar to [Zhang Yi], turned and rushed towards the corridor. He kicked open the dormitory door, [Zhang Weiwei] was huddled in a corner with her head buried. [Qin Lang] pulled the bedding from the bed, soaked in the washbasin, covered [Zhang Weiwei]'s face with it, and carried her out of the room. Flames flickered, smoke filled the air, the burnt beams fell from the roof, narrowly missing [Qin Lang] as he shielded [Zhang Weiwei] and continued to rush outside. The terrifying smoke in the corridor seemed to engulf everything.
0:35:25|0:35:38|[Qin Lang] coughed violently, his face covered in burn marks. Finally, [Qin Lang] staggered out of the corridor filled with photos, placed the wrapped [Zhang Weiwei] on the ground, and slowly collapsed to the side.
0:35:42|0:36:5|[Zhang Weiwei] grabbed [Qin Lang]'s shoulder and shouted loudly, but [Qin Lang] covered his chest without making a sound. The doors in the corridor behind them spewed out tongues of fire. [Zhang Yi] rushed over to help [Zhang Weiwei] lift [Qin Lang] up. [Qin Lang] was carried outside, his eyes unfocused, too weak to even cough. The children surrounded him, silently shedding tears, while [Zhang Weiwei] tightly held his hand, crying uncontrollably.
0:36:5|0:36:11|[Qin Lang] remembered the reply from the grocery store.
0:36:51|0:36:57|Singer [Zhang Weiwei] is wearing a pure white shirt. She lowers her eyes, raises her hand and grips the microphone in front of her.
0:37:21|0:37:31|[Zhang Weiwei] had tears in her eyes, she turned her face away and pinched her nose, but couldn't stop the tears from falling down her cheeks.
0:38:3|0:38:16|Chapter One ends, Chapter Two "Grandpa Solace and Mr. Jackson" begins. The grandfather of the nameless grocery store pushes open the rolling shutter, holding a stack of paper in his left hand and supporting the shelf at the door with his right hand, shuffling out of the store.
0:38:25|0:38:52|Beside the shop, at the entrance of an alley, there is a blackboard with several pieces of paper pinned on it. Grandpa walks to the blackboard, picks up the thumbtacks from the groove, and starts pinning the papers one by one. These papers contain the worries written by the children and the answers written by grandpa, such as why sometimes jealousy arises when others are better than oneself, while other times admiration arises. Grandpa's answer is admiration from afar, jealousy up close, and so on.
0:38:52|0:38:56|When Grandpa returned to the shop, a female journalist suddenly rushed up.
0:39:2|0:39:8|Grandpa took small steps forward with a bag in his hand,
0:39:29|0:39:43|Grandpa widened his eyes, being flashed by the camera's flash. In the pavilion of the park, Xiao Bo, wearing headphones, imitated Michael Jackson's dance moves, and a burst of laughter came from nearby.
0:39:43|0:39:50|Hao Bo took off his headphones and found several male classmates pointing at him, laughing heartily. While laughing, he twisted his body to imitate him, and [Hao Bo] roared in anger.
0:39:51|0:40:16|In the grocery store, Grandpa played with his pocket watch to amuse the cat. He tied the letter securely with a thin string, gently stroked the cat's head, pulled the small stool against the wall a bit, unsteadily climbed onto it, placed the letter box on top of the cabinet, and leaned against the glass window. Xiao Bo stood in front of the shelves, holding a few stickers in his hand. Grandpa saw him and smiled, asking.
0:40:20|0:40:34|Hao Bo took out a few one yuan bills from his pocket and placed them on the counter, quickly picked up the stickers, [Hao Bo] just kept looking at the stickers in his hand as he walked out of the shop door. An old skinny man walked in and said,
0:40:50|0:40:55|A few children outside the shop are scribbling on the wall with colored chalk.
0:41:1|0:41:26|Grandpa pretended to scare them, the children scattered, Xiao Bo earnestly lay on the stool drawing with a pencil, sweat soaking his forehead, he pasted Michael Jackson's photo on the envelope, put the letter in the pocket of his shirt, Xiao Bo leaned against the pillar of the pavilion and sighed deeply, at night, Grandpa pulled down the grocery store shutter, the shutter stopped one foot above the ground, and Grandpa stepped on it firmly with his foot.
0:41:26|0:41:34|[Haobo] sat in the shop opposite and walked over, looked around at the letterbox, and secretly stuffed the letter with a Jackson sticker into the mailbox.
0:41:34|0:41:56|In the alley outside the shop, Grandpa struggled to carry a Coke crate filled with empty bottles to the shelf. Xiao Bo turned around and saw Grandpa, then immediately ran away. Grandpa looked at Xiao Bo's back with some confusion. Inside the shop, Grandpa picked up a small envelope from the letter, which had a Jackson sticker the size of an ID photo on it. Grandpa tore open the sticker and unfolded the letter.
0:41:56|0:42:4|It was a pencil drawing of a child and a tree, with the signature being a portrait of [Jackson].
0:42:4|0:42:42|In Yimin Street, [Xiao Bo] briskly walked into a side alley with a backpack on his back. He arrived at the music store, reached up and took down the Jackson album. [Xiao Bo] flipped through the album in his hand, bypassed the shelves with CDs and tapes, and bounced to the counter. [Xiao Bo] lowered his head and took out the money from his pocket, placing it on the counter one by one. He blankly looked up, took back all the money on the counter, and then turned and left.
0:42:45|0:42:52|Hua Zi called out to him, gesturing for him to come back and twirling the pen, asked,
0:43:8|0:43:24|Haobo walked up to his own mansion with an album in hand. In the window of a van parked outside, a hand holding a cigarette extended out, startling Haobo, who carefully slipped away.
0:43:42|0:44:8|Hao Bo walked towards the inside without looking back. [Mother] helped Hao Bo up the stairs and took off his shirt for him. As soon as he entered the room, he locked [Mother] outside the door. Hao Bo put the disc into the CD player and turned the volume up to the maximum. [Mother] looked anxiously downstairs as Hao Bo lay on the floor with his legs crossed. His bedroom was filled with posters of Jackson.
0:44:8|0:44:15|[Father] shouted impatiently. [Mother] hurriedly knocked on the door.
0:44:17|0:44:22|Hao Bo ignored it, lying on the cushion with his hands on his head. [Mother] ran downstairs to talk to the creditor.
0:44:50|0:45:13|The creditor yawned and pointed with his index finger. Unable to withstand the continuous knocking, Haobo got up and opened the door. [Father] came in angrily, pushed Haobo, took out the disc and slammed it on the ground, then immediately slapped Haobo. [Mother] hurried in and comforted Haobo.
0:45:20|0:45:40|Hao Bo tenderly uses correction fluid to cover the part of the disc that was scratched. He puts the disc back into the case, closes the lid, and Xiao Jun caresses the image of Michael Jackson on the cover. Xiao Jun gets out of the red car parked outside the grocery store and walks into the shop, shouting, "
0:46:54|0:47:9|Xiao Bo found a letter on the blackboard outside the shop. Below the blackboard, he saw a note instructing him to get the letter from the milk box. Xiao Bo opened the milk box, looked around to make sure no one was nearby, and then took the letter.
0:47:35|0:47:42|[Ma Dongmei] is packing up clothes and luggage, while [Xiao Bo] skeptically asks,
0:47:59|0:48:13|Hao Bo returned to the bedroom and put down his school bag. He looked at the cabinet, furrowing his brows as he noticed it was empty. Suddenly, he turned around and opened the door, [Mother] was standing outside.
0:48:45|0:48:52|Hao Bo looked at [Father], who looked up and said.
0:50:11|0:50:42|Idol's scandal lingered in the air, [Xiao Bo] effortlessly pulled off the red scarf tied around his arm, a muffled thunder sounded in the sky, waves crashing against the shore, [Xiao Bo] sat on the beach with his knees hugged, a backpack beside him, thrown into the back seat by his parents.
0:50:42|0:50:59|On a rainy night, Xiao Bo's parents drove into a gas station. After glancing at his mother, his father opened the door and got out of the car to walk towards the gas pump in the pouring rain. In the distance, the prominent words "gasoline" were displayed on the iron mesh. Qin Lang asked, but his mother didn't know what to say.
0:51:30|0:51:55|[Xiao Bo] covered his head with his hands, walked to the entrance of the gas station restroom, stood still and looked back, then sneaked into the men's restroom. With water dripping from his forehead, [Xiao Bo] leaned against the door as his father walked into the restroom holding an umbrella. His father glanced at the rain from under the eaves, pulled up his collar to shield his head, and rushed into the rain. [Xiao Bo] then walked out of the men's restroom.
0:52:8|0:52:31|[Xiao Bo] watched as his parents, who were arguing in the distance, suddenly rushed towards the wall of the gas station. He stepped on the gaps between oil drums and bricks to climb up the wall, with one leg propped on the top of the wall. Looking back at his parents' car with lightning flashing, rain and tears mixed on [Xiao Bo]'s face. He agilely flipped over the wall and leaped down.
0:52:34|0:52:45|Grandpa at the entrance of the grocery store looked at the newspaper with a smile. In the center of the newspaper was a photo of him being interviewed while standing at the store entrance. Grandpa smiled as he flipped through the newspaper, but his smile gradually disappeared on the other side.
0:52:45|0:53:4|Grandpa fixed his gaze on a news report, where a family of three, unable to repay their high-interest loan, met a tragic end while on the run. His pupils trembled as he set down the newspaper, then hurriedly arranged a small stool, stepping on it to reach the top of the cabinet where a box of letters was kept. He accidentally knocked over the box, causing the envelopes to scatter all over the floor, and he also fell down in the process.
0:53:4|0:53:11|Grandpa, ignoring the pain, knelt among the pile of letters, searching desperately. He picked up a few letters in a panic.
0:53:11|0:53:37|Not willing to just push aside the envelope as usual, [Qin Lang] finally picked up a letter with a picture of Jackson on it. He anxiously moved to the counter and opened another letter, which was a pencil drawing depicting a villa and a couple. The old man's eyes dimmed, and he weakly let his hands holding the drawing hang on the counter. He breathed uneasily, as if he had lost something important.
0:53:37|0:53:57|In the train station ticket hall, with few passengers around, [Xiao Bo] was lying on a bench. Upon hearing the voice of the police officer, [Xiao Bo] quickly slid under the bench.
0:54:9|0:54:21|The lights in the lobby went out, the police officer lit up a flashlight and carefully inspected every corner of the lobby. Suddenly, he spotted [Xiao Bo] crouching under the bench. The police officer walked slowly towards [Xiao Bo] and shone the flashlight on his face.
0:54:45|0:54:54|The police officer stood up and walked out of the public security room, closing the door behind him. The man whose hand was stuck on the radiator was reminded by [Hao Bo].
0:54:58|0:55:16|[Haobo] looked out the window, then at the man. With his approval, he immediately gained confidence and climbed onto the bench to open the window, sure that the police were not behind him. The man continued to encourage him to escape. [Haobo] decisively climbed out of the window, leaving the man locked inside, feeling quite pleased with himself.
0:55:16|0:55:41|[Haobo] walked along the corridor outside the window, looking down to see a concrete brick open space below. He ran to the other side and looked down, where there was a large cart piled with goods. [Haobo] waved his thin arms and legs over the railing, and without hesitation, jumped down towards the cart. He rolled down from the bag of goods on the cart.
0:55:43|0:56:12|Under the bridge, several children humming nursery rhymes appeared, picking up plastic bottles with bamboo baskets. When Zhang Weiwei picked up a bottle, she suddenly found a boy popping out of a nearby cardboard box. The unkempt [Hao Bo] stared at the children. Zhang lit a candle with a match, and a group of children gathered around him.
0:56:40|0:56:49|The children of Rainbow House clap together.
0:57:26|0:57:43|Grandpa picked up the newspaper on the table and gestured for Xiao Jun to read it. Xiao Jun took the newspaper, scanned it up and down, and said, "Xiao Jun nodded."
0:58:41|0:59:6|Grandpa nodded silently, put on his coat and walked out of the shop. Passing by the blackboard with the letters, Grandpa stopped and looked at them for a moment before following Xiao Jun out. The letters on the blackboard fluttered in the wind.
0:59:6|0:59:19|Grandpa's unnamed grocery store is still in its original location, with the summer sun shining on the big tree in front of the store. The leaves of the tree have changed from light green to dark green, and the flowers on the balcony are vibrant in color.
0:59:19|0:59:39|In autumn, the plants around the grocery store began to wither, with cold winds blowing, creating a desolate scene. Leaves were drifting in the wind, signaling the arrival of winter. Pedestrians on the road were wrapped tightly in their coats, with snowflakes falling on the path in front of the shop. The roofs and the front of the shop were covered in snow, and the darkening sky seemed as if
0:59:39|0:59:51|Late at night. Half a year later, [Xiao Jun] was driving the car, with his grandfather sitting in the passenger seat.
1:0:28|1:0:52|[Xiao Bo] shook his head with a smile, thinking his grandfather was talking nonsense. The car stopped steadily in front of the grocery store. Inside the house, [Xiao Bo] turned the calendar to December 31, 1993, and clipped the previous pages on top. He wandered around the living room and saw a newspaper on the coffee table. Bending down, he picked up the newspaper and unfolded it. [Xiao Bo] unfolded the newspaper and saw his grandfather's interview.
1:0:52|1:1:12|He carefully folded the newspaper and put it back in its place, then ran his hand over the table. Everything in the room remained exactly as it was when his grandfather left. Xiao Bo saw his grandfather waiting in front of the mailbox.
1:1:29|1:1:55|[Xiao Jun] took big strides up the stairs. The hour hand of the old-fashioned grandfather clock pointed to 12 o'clock, with only two minutes left until the hour. The pendulum of the clock swung back and forth, and at 12:00, the chime rang out. The bell above the letter slot also rang, causing Grandpa to suddenly look up. The letter slot flashed green light, and the first letter dropped down. Watching the letter fall into the letter box, Grandpa smiled happily.
1:1:55|1:2:11|His eyes reflected the flickering green light from the mailbox, and the letters kept falling down into the mailbox. Grandpa watched as all the letters fell into the mailbox, and the bell stopped ringing.
1:2:11|1:2:33|Grandpa trembled as he picked up all the letters in the basket. Sitting at the table, he smiled as he opened the letters, showing a much more agile side than his usual slow movements. Blowing on the envelope, Grandpa carefully read the contents of the letter through half-frame glasses.
1:2:33|1:2:48|The full moon hangs high in the sky, it seems like a long time has passed. [Xiao Bo] yawns as he walks down the stairs, rubbing his neck as he heads towards the inner room. Through the window, he sees his grandfather still engrossed in reading a letter.
1:3:10|1:3:31|Grandpa continued to open another letter and found a painting inside. He read excitedly. Grandpa almost pressed his face against the letter. Below the painting, there was a paragraph that said it was Michael Jackson who wrote a letter to Grandpa 25 years ago.
1:4:8|1:4:31|As they were talking, another letter fell into the mailbox. Xiao Bo walked over to the mailbox, leaned in to look inside, then looked back at the mailbox in confusion. He came back holding a piece of white paper, and at that moment, Grandpa took a look at the paper.
1:5:14|1:5:29|[Xiao Jun] saw Grandpa burying his head in the letter, so he took his own letter and walked out. He returned to the car, opened the envelope, and found Grandpa's notes inside.
1:6:40|1:7:0|Grandpa remained hunched over the table, as the light in front of him gradually dimmed until it merged with the darkness. In the courtyard of Rainbow House, Xiao Bo was holding a paintbrush, concentrating on painting on the wall. The wall was quickly filled with Xiao Bo's imaginative drawings.
1:7:0|1:7:16|The main wall depicts the silhouette of [Qin Lang] holding a guitar, surrounded by countless yellow pentagrams painted by Xiao Bo. As time passes, the young Xiao Bo is now painting in front of the wall, and the walls of the Rainbow House record Xiao Bo's transformation.
1:7:16|1:7:41|Time flies to the year 2017, on the walls of the exhibition hall, there is a portrait composed of many faces, the exhibition theme is "Everyone has a hole in their heart". The exhibition hall is bustling, people are stopping to take photos in front of the portraits, foreign friends are holding up wine glasses to admire the paintings, a man with long curly hair is pointing at the painting and discussing with his friends, and a tall and beautiful woman is taking a group photo in front of the painting.
1:9:1|1:9:17|He waved to his foreign friend, took out a cigarette from his pocket and put it in his mouth, then turned back and looked. [Zhang Mo] took out his phone, and it was a WeChat message from [Zhang Yi]. He opened the chat box, and [Zhang Yi] said.
1:9:17|1:9:30|[Zhang Mo] took the cigarette out of his mouth, put the phone in his pocket, and walked out of the exhibition hall's red carpet at the entrance, where the red carpet turned into the wall of Rainbow House.
1:9:50|1:9:58|[Zhang Mo] walked down the familiar Yimin Street from his childhood, turned into an alley, and used his phone to take a picture of the road sign on the stone wall.
1:10:0|1:10:17|The wall by the roadside is covered in modern graffiti. Xiao Bo walks along, recording the changes in the alley with his phone. He notices a standalone bar with a neon sign that reads "Déjà vu Bar". Xiao Bo enters the bar and sits by the window, taking off his red scarf and placing it on the table.
1:10:17|1:10:26|Hua Zi came to [Zhang Mo] and asked, while Zhang Mo, who was focused on looking at the bar decoration, snapped back to reality and stared at Hua Zi.
1:10:38|1:10:49|[Zhang Mo] ordered a single malt whisky, and there were many Michael Jackson album covers on the wall. Tears welled up in [Zhang Mo]'s eyes.
1:11:10|1:11:38|Hua Zi turned around and brought a long box of albums in front of [Zhang Mo]. [Zhang Mo]'s gaze locked onto the disc. [Zhang Mo] took out several albums and looked at them carefully one by one. Smiling, he appreciated Hua Zi's collection. Then, [Zhang Mo] took out a few more discs and looked at them. Suddenly, he seemed to have turned into stone, as the album in his hand was very familiar to him.
1:11:38|1:11:52|[Zhang Mo] put down the other discs, opened the album in his hand, took out the CD and looked at it, then put it back in the case. There were two white marks on the front of the CD. Hua Zi took the disc case and looked at it.
1:12:32|1:12:48|Hua Zi stood up, followed by [Zhang Mo], and they came to a wall in the bar covered with frames filled with old newspaper briefings. Hua Zi pointed to one of the frames.
1:12:54|1:13:24|[Zhang Mo] leaned in to look closely at the newspaper in the frame, the headline read "Family of Three Dies in Escape Attempt Due to Inability to Repay High-interest Loans". Many years ago, on the winding mountain road, a white sedan was driving with Hao Bo's mother crying out to her husband, when suddenly a black jeep started chasing them from behind.
1:13:25|1:13:55|Father also noticed the car, he sped up, the Jeep chased after, on the left side of the BMW, the creditor shouted, father's eyes were terrifying, staring ahead, the black Jeep violently hit the BMW body, the Jeep forcefully hit the BMW again.
1:14:2|1:14:22|The creditor grabbed the handle and gave the BMW a final blow, causing it to slide close to the hillside. It crashed into a protruding boulder on the hillside, shattering the glass. The mother in the passenger seat was covered in blood. The black jeep hit a piece of broken stone, instantly bursting a tire, causing the steering wheel to malfunction, and it crashed through the guardrail of the ring road and fell into the valley.
1:14:23|1:14:48|In the BMW car, [Haobo]'s father just woke up from the steering wheel, his wife beside him with blood all over her face, breathing weakly. The massive rock that the BMW crashed into was a small protrusion from the mountain, but it ended [Haobo]'s mother's life. The father regretfully held his wife's hand, his eyes tightly closed, his expression pained. He pressed his wife's hand against his forehead, then let go, swallowing back his sobs, trying hard to calm his emotions.
1:14:48|1:14:54|He pursed his lips and opened the car door, anxiously looking around for the shadow of the black jeep.
1:14:56|1:15:12|The father saw a gap in the guardrail and hurriedly ran over to check. The black jeep was already engulfed in flames at the bottom of the cliff. The father lay on the guardrail, clutching his hair in agony. He buried his face in his arms, sobbing as he crouched down.
1:15:16|1:15:21|The father leaned against the steering wheel and wrote a farewell letter in a notebook,
1:15:48|1:16:1|[Zhang Mo] watched the news and suddenly rushed out of the bar, leaning against the wall and crying uncontrollably. Many years ago, his father finished writing his will, closed the notebook, sighed lightly, tucked the notebook into the interlayer of his bag, put the pen in the bag as well, and then closed the clasp.
1:16:3|1:16:30|The white BMW started and drove away from the bridge. At the gap in the bridge railing was [Hao Bo]'s father's wallet. His face was flushed as he drove the battered BMW, the right side of the car already smashed to pieces with only a faint light from the right headlight. Suddenly stepping on the gas, the car sped wildly on the mountain road. As he approached a bend, the father sharply turned the steering wheel, crashing through the guardrail and soaring into the sky. The white BMW plummeted in mid-air.
1:16:30|1:16:45|Xiao Bo plunged into the deep blue and tranquil sea, the splashes of water from the car returning to calmness after a few seconds. Outside the bar, [Zhang Mo] bit his fist hard, trying not to cry out loud.
1:17:31|1:17:56|[Zhang Mo] stuffed the letter into the mailbox, the envelope dropping into the pile of letters. The figure of his grandfather loomed over the stack of mail. He took all the letters out of the mailbox, walking with small steps towards the inner room. Passing by cabinets filled with various goods, on the low table outside the inner room window, there were bottles of similar sizes. He slowly walked to the desk, supporting his body with his hands as he sat down.
1:17:56|1:18:13|Grandpa took a deep breath and couldn't wait to open the letter. He picked up the first letter, carefully opened the envelope, and one by one, the wide-mouthed bottle on the cabinet outside the door disappeared, making the room dim and lightless.
1:18:13|1:18:43|This is a grocery store in 2018, with warm candlelight flickering. Beside the counter, [Tong Tong] is playing the guitar while [Xiao Bo] is quietly listening. In the room nearby, [A Jie] is leaning on the leather sofa, falling asleep with his head supported. On the coffee table next to him are stolen handbags and emptied wallets. Faintly, the sound of [Tong Tong]'s guitar can be heard. [Xiao Bo] lights another candle with one.
1:18:43|1:18:54|[Tong Tong] sat on the steps, looking at the poster of the dream girl. [Xiao Bo] silently sat opposite her and snatched the poster away.
1:19:14|1:19:23|In the inner room, there suddenly came the sound of weeping. [A Jie] seemed to have a nightmare, shedding tears and mumbling incoherent words.
1:19:38|1:19:47|[A Jie] woke up with tears in his eyes, immediately wiping them away with his sleeve. [Tong Tong] reached out to take the poster and asked for advice from [Xiao Bo].
1:19:52|1:19:58|[Tong Tong] picked up the guitar with a smile, strumming the strings and singing.
1:20:12|1:20:17|[A Jie] angrily stopped the pain, and the bell rang again.
1:20:41|1:20:44|[A Jie] seemed to be touched by a hidden pain, snatching the letter away. Chapter Three.
1:20:59|1:21:17|In the 1990s nightclub, Xiao Bo, with heavy makeup, drinks a glass of red wine. A customer hands her a banknote, and she immediately takes a whole bottle of red wine and drinks it all in one go. Xiao Bo then showily shakes the wine bottle, and the people around applaud and cheer.
1:21:18|1:21:33|Near the grocery store, Xiao Bo was hugging a utility pole and vomiting wildly. Not far away, Qin Lang was holding a letter and looking at her. Qin Lang glanced back at the grocery store before focusing his gaze back on Xiao Bo. Xiao Bo, who was drunk, swayed forward and, upon seeing Qin Lang, asked cautiously.
1:21:48|1:22:12|[Qin Lang] left with the letter, Qingmei sneered, then twitched her mouth and smiled. Her eyes rolled around and landed on the unnamed grocery store that [Qin Lang] mentioned. The advertisement in front of the store fluttered in the wind. Inside the nightclub, a man in a shirt and sunglasses called a waiter over, who then walked over with a tray.
1:22:19|1:22:35|Carrying the tray to the front of the stage, Xiao Bo said to [Qin Lang], [Qin Lang] bent down to pick up the rose, smiled towards [Mr. Su], and [Mr. Su] waved to her, beckoning her to his side.
1:22:56|1:23:18|[Qingmei] and [Mr. Su] clinked glasses, [Mr. Su] took out a few 100 yuan bills from a stack of money and placed them in front of [Qingmei]. They danced in the dance floor, with [Mr. Su] embracing her and [Qingmei] leaning her head on his shoulder, showing great intimacy between the two.
1:23:18|1:23:37|[Xiao Bo] and [Qin Lang] were shopping together. [Xiao Bo] was skeptical about what she heard, while [Qin Lang] squatted down to help her try on shoes.
1:24:7|1:24:12|In the grocery store, [A Jie] angrily crumples up the letter and throws it away.
1:24:47|1:24:55|[Qingmei] opened the milk box and found a letter inside, so she took it out and read it while walking. [Qingmei] wrote a reply in the dressing room.
1:25:16|1:25:23|In the Rainbow House, [Qingmei] is hanging out clothes with the little girl, Xiao Bo.
1:27:51|1:28:5|Mr. Li's assistant tried to run when he saw the police, but was quickly pushed back to his seat by the police. Mr. Li took a drag on his cigarette and looked at the police on both sides, saying,
1:28:43|1:29:7|In the grocery store, [A Jie] woke himself up from a nap, sitting next to the mail slot. After taking a closer look at the mail slot, he let out a long sigh. Turning his head to the two people behind him, [A Jie] was just saying when a letter dropped from the mail slot. He quickly tore open the envelope.
1:29:46|1:29:58|[A Jie] took the pen and wrote. [Qin Lang] opened the milk carton again, eagerly taking the letter.
1:31:3|1:31:15|The three of them lay side by side on the table, [A Jie] and [Tong Tong] exchanged a smile, while [Xiao Bo] seemed to have figured something out. He turned around, picked up the letter, and examined it carefully.
1:31:38|1:31:58|Xiao Bo raised his hand and stuffed the white paper into the letterbox at the front door, while Tong Tong suddenly looked up at the sky.
1:32:0|1:32:19|[A Jie] said regretfully, [Tong Tong] lowered her eyes. [A Jie] slowly walked back into the inner room and slumped on the sofa. [Tong Tong] picked up the guitar and leaned against the door frame, saying.
1:32:21|1:32:47|[A Jie] asked in return, [Tong Tong] glanced at [Xiao Bo] beside her, who had no suggestions either. [A Jie] took out a coin from his pocket and tossed it into the air. As he slapped the coin back onto his hand, it rolled to the ground with a clatter. Bending down to search for it, [A Jie] suddenly noticed a letter underneath the package on the coffee table. He picked up the letter and walked towards the other two.
1:32:52|1:32:56|The three of them gathered together, and [A Jie] quickly tore open the envelope and unfolded the letter.
1:35:23|1:35:28|Qingmei from Rainbow House opened the door and got out of the car wearing sunglasses.
1:35:34|1:35:47|The bodyguard stopped a group of reporters from following, Qingmei and her assistant walked into the courtyard. On the second-floor balcony, [Xiao Bo] looked at her through the stone railing, his gaze closely following Qingmei, but his eyes filled with resentment. Qingmei walked into the room, took off her sunglasses, and greeted with a smile.
1:36:15|1:36:28|Miss Zhang took out several old red lacquer wooden boxes. Miss Zhang handed a pocket watch to Qingmei, and then took out a letter. On the envelope, it was written "Rainbow, please open". Inside the envelope was a black and white photo of a man and a woman.
1:37:34|1:37:55|Qingmei saw the comfort notice on the computer, in front of the photo wall in the corridor, Qingmei looked at the years of memories of Rainbow House, one photo caught her eye, it was a group photo of [A Jie] [Tong Tong] [Xiao Bo].
1:37:55|1:38:0|Her gaze shifted back to the photo wall, leaning in to look at [Mrs. Zhang]'s photo.
1:39:38|1:39:47|[A Jie] leaned weakly against the stone railing,
1:40:10|1:40:18|Xiao Bo's pupils trembled, looking at A Jie in disbelief. The three of them arrived at Qingmei's villa at night and even taped up Qingmei.
1:40:22|1:40:31|Xiao Bo, Tong Tong, and Qin Lang sat on the steps, reminiscing about what happened last night.
1:40:43|1:41:1|[Tong Tong] looked up at the sky, urged by [A Jie]. She put the notebook and cosmetics on the table back into Qingmei's bag. [Xiao Bo] was sorting out the mail at the counter, while [A Jie] sat blankly on the steps. [Tong Tong] walked out from the inner room and placed Qingmei's bag on the table.
1:41:1|1:41:10|Leaning against the table, [A Jie] looks towards [A Jie], who seems to be regretting something. [Tong Tong] takes out a poster of the dream girl from the pocket of her denim jacket.
1:41:10|1:41:31|Taking a closer look, then handing the poster to [A Jie], who reached out to take it. [Xiao Bo] put all the letters back into the envelope. [A Jie] smiled and asked [Tong Tong]. [Tong Tong] shyly nodded, and the two smiled at each other.
1:41:31|1:41:44|[A Jie] saw Xiao Bo sorting out the letters with a frown and asked. Xiao Bo slowly raised his head to look at the wall with empty eyes. A Jie waited quietly for his answer. Xiao Bo took a deep breath and turned to A Jie.
1:41:53|1:42:25|[A Jie] and [Tong Tong] smiled knowingly, the back door of the grocery store opened, and three people walked out from the house. [A Jie] squinted in the sunlight outside, [Xiao Bo] closed the wooden door and pulled the last latch. [A Jie] opened the milk box again and found a reply letter inside. [Xiao Bo] quickly approached and read aloud, the three of them sat together to read the letter.
