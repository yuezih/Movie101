0:2:26|0:2:47|In the luxury mansion, [Mr. Fan] leaned back on the bed, holding the remote control and pressing a button next to the window. The curtains slowly opened, and he shook a bell from the bedside, prompting his female secretary to enter the room.
0:3:3|0:3:18|The secretary led the way, with [Mr. Fan] leisurely following behind, tying his robe belt as he walked through the luxurious reception room and corridor into the dining room. The secretary gave a brief introduction.
0:3:40|0:3:58|[Mr. Fan] walked to the front of the restaurant, cracked open an egg, and his secretary quickly came forward to pull out a chair for [Qin Fen]. As [Mr. Fan] peeled the egg, he spoke.
0:4:46|0:4:59|Mr. Fan, who was attracted, wiped his hands and listened carefully. Mr. Fan tried to change his hand position himself.
0:5:1|0:5:19|[Qin Fen] stood up and picked up the safe, placing it on the table. He took out a blue cylindrical container with a hollow middle and two handles.
0:5:43|0:5:54|The two of them each put their hands into the tube and conducted an experiment at both ends.
0:5:59|0:6:9|[Qin Fen] finished speaking and looked at the secretary in the corner, who also looked at [Qin Fen] and bit her lip while applauding.
0:7:11|0:7:23|[Qin Fen] received the 2 million pounds and went to a coffee shop, editing his dating profile on a website.
0:9:30|0:9:47|[Qin Fen]'s marriage proposal information was posted online, and he arranged to meet the first applicant at a high-end restaurant. [Qin Fen] was already waiting on the second floor of the restaurant for this blind date.
0:9:48|0:10:7|The scene follows a short-haired woman dressed in a fashionable and sexy manner entering a high-end restaurant. The restaurant is quiet, elegant, spacious, and brightly lit. The waiters are meticulously performing their duties. The short-haired woman stands in front of a mirror on the first floor.
0:10:7|0:10:17|After taking a quick look in the mirror and tidying up her hair, [Liang Xiaoxiao] walked up to the second floor. The staff in the corridor on the second floor also warmly welcomed her.
0:10:18|0:10:36|The woman nodded politely in response. [Qin Fen], who had been waiting on the second floor, never took his eyes off her. He thought she was Jasmine, the blind date he was meeting today. As the woman passed by [Qin Fen], she greeted the people at the table behind him.
0:10:37|0:10:45|Not until the short-haired woman sat down did [Qin Fen] shift his gaze. [Qin Fen] returned somewhat regretfully to his designated seat.
0:10:46|0:11:0|Qin Fen occasionally glanced towards the first floor. He returned to his seat and sat down. At this moment, a man wearing sunglasses and a tight T-shirt also sat down.
0:11:24|0:11:31|[Qin Jianguo] took off the women's sunglasses and placed them on the table, [Qin Fen] stood up and shook hands with [Jianguo].
0:11:59|0:12:5|Qin Fen leaned back and looked at Jianguo with a puzzled expression.
0:12:24|0:12:40|Jianguo shyly glanced at [Qin Fen]. [Qin Fen] looked thoughtfully as Jianguo pointed at him.
0:13:20|0:13:31|[Qin Fen] quickly interrupted Jianguo's words and said after some thought,
0:14:42|0:14:50|Jianguo grinned and called out "brother" without a smile, and [Qin Fen] responded straightforwardly.
0:14:56|0:15:7|[Qin Fen] and the second candidate arranged to meet in a picturesque park. The second candidate was a pretty girl in a black short-sleeved shirt.
0:17:24|0:17:38|[Qin Fen] stared at the girl who was earnestly selling cemetery plots without saying a word. The girl, with big round eyes, nodded at [Qin Fen], and when he snapped out of it, he turned and left first.
0:17:38|0:17:54|The third location is a high-end coffee shop, where a woman in a white shirt and black skirt, with outstanding looks, sits by the window, feeling low and expressionless, waiting for [Qin Fen].
0:17:55|0:18:6|After looking around, [Qin Fen] slowly walked towards the window. Taking off his sunglasses, [Qin Fen] asked,
0:18:19|0:18:27|After sitting down, [Qin Fen] politely smiled at [Liang Xiaoxiao], while [Qin Fen] looked [Liang Xiaoxiao] up and down.
0:18:29|0:18:40|Liang Xiaoxiao looked uneasily towards the window, then smiled at Qin Fen. Qin Fen, attracted by her beauty, was speechless for a while.
0:18:56|0:19:26|[Qin Fen] nodded, stood up and placed the backpack he carried on his back aside. He then sat upright in the middle of the sofa, looking at [Liang Xiaoxiao] with a smile on her face. [Liang Xiaoxiao] thought for a moment, lowered her head and remained silent.
0:20:11|0:20:17|[Liang Xiaoxiao] chuckled and then regained control.
0:20:24|0:20:35|Qin Fen leaned back on the sofa smugly.
0:22:1|0:22:7|Upon finishing speaking, [Qin Fen] stood up with his bag, ready to leave.
0:22:48|0:22:55|[Qin Fen] walked out of the coffee shop, followed by [Liang Xiaoxiao].
0:23:22|0:23:43|After finishing their conversation, the two of them arrived at a quiet bar. Inside the bar, they ordered some food and a bottle of white wine. [Liang Xiaoxiao] raised her glass to signal [Qin Fen] to drink. Seeing [Qin Fen] raise his glass, [Liang Xiaoxiao] drank it all in one go. When [Liang Xiaoxiao], who had put down her glass, saw that [Qin Fen] had only taken a small sip, she then put down her glass.
0:23:43|0:23:46|Liang Xiaoxiao looked disappointed and said,
0:24:38|0:24:47|The two fell silent for a moment, each lost in their own thoughts.
0:25:32|0:25:39|After Qin Fen finished speaking, he leaned back and looked at Liang Xiaoxiao. Liang Xiaoxiao took a deep breath, lowered her head, and smiled, saying,
0:25:58|0:26:9|Understanding Qin Fen stepped forward and looked at Liang Xiaoxiao, saying,
0:26:18|0:26:37|Tears welled up in [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s eyes, but did not fall. [Liang Xiaoxiao] sighed and said, then after a few drinks, she spoke candidly,
0:27:21|0:27:25|[Qin Fen] leaned back in his chair and watched [Liang Xiaoxiao] sigh helplessly.
0:27:50|0:28:15|[Qin Fen] stared blankly at [Liang Xiaoxiao], then went to the restroom. After washing his hands in the restroom, he sighed in front of the mirror, dried his hands, and returned to his seat. Looking at the already dizzy [Liang Xiaoxiao], he asked,
0:28:19|0:28:25|[Qin Fen] takes off his hat, picks up the wine glass on the table and drinks it all, then refills the glasses for the other two.
0:28:29|0:28:39|[Liang Xiaoxiao] looked at [Qin Fen] pouring wine, her face brightening up again.
0:30:52|0:31:9|[Liang Xiaoxiao] picked up the wine glass and took a sip, disdainfully asking, then [Liang Xiaoxiao] finished the rest in one gulp. [Qin Fen] solemnly picked up the wine glass and poured himself another full glass.
0:31:53|0:32:36|[Qin Fen] eyes reddened, choked up with words at the corner of his mouth that he couldn't say, emotions gradually out of control, lips trembling slightly, hands covering his face sobbing.
0:33:58|0:34:5|After finishing speaking, he picked up the wine glass again and drank it all in one gulp.
0:34:11|0:34:22|[Liang Xiaoxiao] looked straight at him without saying a word.
0:34:28|0:34:44|[Liang Xiaoxiao] watched [Qin Fen] for a moment before getting up and leaving, leaving [Qin Fen] alone sitting at the table.
0:34:45|0:34:51|After some time, [Qin Fen] embarked on his matchmaking journey again.
0:34:57|0:35:7|A girl in Miao costume nodded, shaking the silver ornaments on her head. [Qin Fen] played badminton while reminiscing about his blind date process.
0:35:15|0:35:22|[Qin Fen] glanced at the woman who was taking notes, then he and another woman played badminton in the gym.
0:36:33|0:36:46|After several failed blind dates, Qin Fen flew to Hainan to relax with a friend. His friend picked him up at the airport in a car.
0:37:15|0:37:32|[Qin Fen] met the woman introduced by his friend during the vacation. He looked at her somewhat puzzled.
0:37:56|0:38:5|[Qin Fen] furrowed his brow and pondered for a moment before saying,
0:39:54|0:40:16|[Qin Fen] looked at her expectantly, only to see the woman slowly extend a finger. [Qin Fen] lowered his head in disappointment, covering his face. The woman bent down and said to [Qin Fen],
0:40:34|0:41:4|[Qin Fen] helplessly rests his chin on his hand and looks at the scenery, while the woman sits dejectedly in her chair and asks in confusion. Both of them rest their chins on their hands and turn their heads in different directions, no longer speaking. The blind date in Hainan also ended in failure for [Qin Fen]. After the trip to Hainan, [Qin Fen] rushes to the airport to go back.
0:41:4|0:41:19|While smoking outside the station, [Qin Fen] overheard a middle-aged man next to him making a phone call. Upon hearing the name [Liang Xiaoxiao], he turned around and listened for a few moments.
0:42:0|0:42:39|Liang Xiaoxiao angrily hung up the phone with her lover Wang Xin, tightly gripping her phone. After calming down, Liang Xiaoxiao walked towards the cabin, where she greeted passengers as usual at the cabin door. At that moment, Qin Fen took off his sunglasses, looked down at Liang Xiaoxiao's name tag, but Liang Xiaoxiao did not respond.
0:43:0|0:43:33|At work, [Liang Xiaoxiao] looked at him without saying a word, and Wang Xin reluctantly walked to his seat. Coincidentally, Wang Xin's wife and [Qin Fen] were sitting together. [Qin Fen] enthusiastically helped Mrs. Wang put away her luggage, while Wang Xin sat in another row. At this moment, [Liang Xiaoxiao] was organizing the luggage compartment in the aisle. Wang Xin watched as [Liang Xiaoxiao] passed by without acknowledging him, so he prepared to close his eyes and rest.
0:43:33|0:43:41|Liang Xiaoxiao came to Mrs. Wang while performing cabin service.
0:44:30|0:44:41|Madam Wang nodded in agreement, while the lover looked at [Qin Fen] with a puzzled expression and asked,
0:44:57|0:45:4|Wang Xin glanced at [Qin Fen] and stood up helplessly, walking over to his wife. Mrs. Wang also stood up and thanked [Qin Fen].
0:45:20|0:45:36|The plane slowly takes off, [Liang Xiaoxiao] sits low-spirited in her seat. Sitting across from her, [Qin Fen] notices that [Liang Xiaoxiao] hasn't fastened her seatbelt, so he presses the call button. Seeing the lit call button, [Liang Xiaoxiao] walks over to [Qin Fen].
0:45:49|0:46:7|[Liang Xiaoxiao] said nothing, turned and walked towards her seat, fastened her seatbelt, then glanced at [Qin Fen]. Seeing [Qin Fen] propping his chin up, smiling at her, she rolled her eyes and turned her head away.
0:46:14|0:46:20|Married Man's Wife is reading a book in the cabin, while Married Man next to her is wearing an eye mask and turned his head to the other side, sleeping.
0:46:23|0:46:46|[Qin Fen] said to [Liang Xiaoxiao] in the operating room, but [Liang Xiaoxiao] was absent-mindedly preparing drinks and did not pay attention to him. After finishing, she continued to work at the operating table without saying anything extra to [Qin Fen]. Seeing this, [Qin Fen] walked over slowly and said,
0:46:55|0:47:9|After Qin Fen finished speaking, he went back to his seat. Liang Xiaoxiao remained focused on her work, not paying any attention to him. After he left, Liang Xiaoxiao lowered her head, lost in thought. In the blink of an eye, they were at the beautiful West Lake in Hangzhou.
0:47:10|0:47:16|[Qin Fen] is on a boat on the lake, with a little girl next to him explaining the history.
0:50:10|0:50:23|Liang Xiaoxiao took a car to the teahouse, where a man and a woman were performing Suzhou Pingtan with a pipa and erhu.
0:50:29|0:50:46|At this moment, [Liang Xiaoxiao] walked past the two and entered the teahouse. The teahouse was bustling with activity, with groups of three to five people at each table, leisurely chatting over tea. After wandering around for a while, [Liang Xiaoxiao] finally found [Qin Fen] who was on a blind date, and she casually sat down at an empty table.
0:51:18|0:51:25|[Qin Fen] couldn't help but smile and waved his hand.
0:52:44|0:52:49|After listening to the Taiwanese girl excitedly grab [Qin Fen]'s hand,
0:53:46|0:53:51|[Qin Fen] avoided the girl's gaze and leaned back in the chair.
0:54:42|0:54:50|The girl looked pitiful and aggrieved, lowered her head and looked to the side without saying a word.
0:55:1|0:55:21|[Liang Xiaoxiao] frowned and watched the two of them, the Taiwanese girl got up and left the teahouse in disappointment. [Liang Xiaoxiao] sitting at another table finished watching and then came over with her tea.
0:56:9|0:56:27|Xiaoxiao wanted to argue but couldn't find the words. Qin Fen glanced at her and then said,
0:57:13|0:57:43|[Liang Xiaoxiao] got up and walked out of the teahouse. Although [Qin Fen] said he wouldn't go, he eventually compromised. The two walked towards Wang Xin's club, one in front and one behind. Inside the club, the tea artist brewed tea methodically, while Wang Xin drank his tea expressionlessly and in silence.
0:57:43|0:58:16|Wang Xingang picked up the cup to drink, only to see [Liang Xiaoxiao] and another person walking over. [Liang Xiaoxiao] sat across from Wang Xin at a small square table, with [Qin Fen] sitting on his right. The tea artist smiled, nodded, and then walked out.
0:59:32|0:59:41|Wang Xin stared at [Liang Xiaoxiao] without blinking.
0:59:46|0:59:54|Wang Xin's face was solemn, with his head down as if he was pondering something.
0:59:58|1:0:9|[Qin Fen] turned around, sat down and listened attentively. [Qin Fen] nodded earnestly.
1:0:34|1:0:47|[Liang Xiaoxiao] lowered her head, and no one spoke. After a moment of silence, [Qin Fen] said,
1:0:51|1:1:7|He finished speaking and stood up to leave, but was stopped by [Qin Fen] when Wang Xin tried to get up.
1:1:9|1:1:17|After Qin Fen finished speaking, he turned and left. Liang Xiaoxiao looked aggrieved and angry as she watched Wang Xin.
1:1:18|1:1:38|Seeing Wang Xin remained silent, Qin Fen got up and poured himself a glass of wine at the liquor cabinet. Liang Xiaoxiao stood in front of the liquor cabinet with her back to Wang Xin. Wang Xin looked at her, then turned around and lowered his head without saying a word.
1:1:55|1:2:35|Wang Xin stood up and snatched the wine from [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s hand. He pulled [Liang Xiaoxiao] over and grabbed the wine glass from her hand. [Liang Xiaoxiao] angrily tried to hit Wang Xin, who attempted to hug [Liang Xiaoxiao]. However, she resisted vigorously and pushed him away forcefully. Wang Xin, who was pushed away, calmed down. [Liang Xiaoxiao] angrily started hitting him, while Wang Xin bowed his head and let her vent. [Liang Xiaoxiao] cried in anger, but Wang Xin remained silent with his head down.
1:2:35|1:2:38|The sky darkens as the two of them cuddle in the small boat.
1:2:39|1:2:47|The boat slowly sailed on West Lake, with the setting sun blending the lake, sky, trees, and water into one.
1:3:2|1:3:8|Wang Xin held [Liang Xiaoxiao] in his arms, but remained silent.
1:3:51|1:4:16|During a break, [Qin Fen], who was wiping sweat, received a text message. He put down the towel, opened his phone, and saw that the message was from Liang Xiaoxiao. The message said, and then [Qin Fen] called back and left a message for Liang Xiaoxiao.
1:4:43|1:4:50|The next day, [Qin Fen] arrived at a small pavilion by the lake, starting his blind date journey.
1:6:58|1:7:16|[Qin Fen] turned around to look for [Liang Xiaoxiao], the blind date woman also looked at her. [Qin Fen] hung up the phone, took off his sunglasses and self-mockingly said,
1:7:44|1:7:51|After speaking, the two stood up and politely shook hands.
1:7:55|1:8:8|Blind date over, [Qin Fen] arrived at a small pub where [Liang Xiaoxiao] was also present. [Qin Fen] stood at the door watching [Liang Xiaoxiao] absentmindedly drinking, then walked over and tapped her. [Liang Xiaoxiao] snapped out of it and looked at [Qin Fen].
1:8:38|1:8:53|[Xiaoxiao] looked at him seriously, [Qin Fen] finished the watermelon and looked at her with confusion on his face. The two of them remained silent for a while, and then [Qin Fen] wiped his hands and said,
1:10:51|1:11:19|Two people met and smiled at each other, then they took the same car to Hokkaido. At a remote seaside in Hokkaido, the train carrying [Qin Fen] and [Liang Xiaoxiao] slowly pulled into the station. The train stopped at the sparsely populated station, and after it came to a halt, the two of them got off with their luggage. [Qin Fen]'s old friend [Wu Sang] was already waiting for them on the platform and walked up to them when they got off.
1:11:25|1:11:32|After embracing, [Qin Fen] looked at [Wu Sang] intently.
1:11:52|1:12:24|[Wu Sang] took the suitcase and the three of them walked towards the car. The three drove along the rural roads of Hokkaido, with the scenery outside reflecting on [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s face. She half-opened the car window and gazed at the scenery outside, lost in thought.
1:12:31|1:12:41|[Qin Fen] didn't hear a response for half a day, so he turned around and woke her up.
1:13:29|1:13:52|The car stopped at the entrance of the temple, [Qin Fen] got out. After speaking, [Qin Fen] walked towards the temple, followed by [Wu Sang] driving the car.
1:14:2|1:14:10|Wu Sang approached after finishing the conversation with the monks in the temple and said,
1:14:50|1:14:54|After speaking, [Wu Sang] walked towards the temple.
1:15:3|1:15:21|After persuading the monk, the three of them arrived at the entrance of the hall, took off their shoes, and then opened the door to enter. At the entrance, a Japanese person in a kimono conducted a body search on them.
1:15:34|1:15:50|In the hall, the monks are chanting, and dozens of Japanese people in kimonos are kneeling neatly below. [Qin Fen] and two others are kneeling at the back. [Qin Fen] keeps looking around at the bodyguards on the side, and the bodyguards are also watching him.
1:15:58|1:16:17|After the worship, the three of them left. In the car, [Wu Sang] said to [Qin Fen],
1:16:55|1:17:34|[Qin Fen] turned around and grabbed her hand, [Liang Xiaoxiao] smiled and pushed his hand away. The car drove along the winding road, and as they entered the city, the sky darkened and it started to rain. Not knowing the way, [Wu Sang] got off the car to ask passersby for the location of the hotel.
1:17:44|1:18:4|On the lightbox are four beautiful young women in kimonos. Once they knew the way, they drove towards the hotel.
1:18:9|1:18:22|The car stopped at the entrance of the hotel, and three people got out one after another. [Qin Fen] and [Wu Sang] whispered to each other as they took luggage from the trunk.
1:18:44|1:18:57|Pack up the luggage, settle in a picturesque and spacious hotel room, the attendant leaves after placing clothes in [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s room.
1:19:5|1:19:26|A person in the room, [Liang Xiaoxiao], looked at the sea outside the window, not only reminding her of the time spent with Wang Xin in Hokkaido, but also plunging her into deep memories, flashing happy scenes with Wang Xin in Hokkaido in her mind.
1:19:26|1:19:50|During dinner, Wu Sang cracked a raw egg into the rice, mixed it with caviar, and handed it to Qin Fen. Qin Fen scooped up a spoonful and put it in his mouth, then grimaced at Wu Sang and said,
1:21:36|1:21:44|[Qin Fen] put down his chopsticks and hugged [Liang Xiaoxiao], whispering in her ear,
1:22:11|1:22:20|Liang Xiaoxiao angrily pushed him away, Qin Fen and Liang Xiaoxiao locked eyes for a moment before glancing at Wu Sang, then turned to Liang Xiaoxiao and said,
1:22:50|1:23:23|After listening, [Liang Xiaoxiao] angrily walked out of the restaurant. [Qin Fen] stopped Wu Sang who was about to follow, clinked glasses with him, saw Liang Xiaoxiao come back and stand at the door looking at Qin Fen. Qin Fen waved at Liang Xiaoxiao to come over, she walked over but did not sit down, instead took the clothes on the back of the chair and left.
1:23:23|1:23:49|[Wu Sang] stood up again after seeing it. Back at the hotel, [Liang Xiaoxiao] soaked in the hot spring alone. As night fell quietly, only a trace of the setting sun hung on the horizon, [Liang Xiaoxiao], dressed, looked out at the sea from the pier, with only her figure in the distance.
1:23:57|1:24:14|On the other side, after finishing their meal, [Qin Fen] and [Wu Sang] drove to the downtown area. After getting out of the car, the two of them walked and talked.
1:25:35|1:25:41|Wu Sang, with a puzzled look on his face, hadn't reacted yet,
1:27:1|1:27:24|After a while, [Liang Xiaoxiao] took a taxi to the outside of the izakaya and stopped. After getting off the car, [Liang Xiaoxiao] walked into the izakaya.
1:27:27|1:27:41|The atmosphere in the room was cheerful at this moment. [Wu Sang] held Xia Dai's hand and sang on the stage, while Xue Jiang danced beside them.
1:27:42|1:27:54|And [Qin Fen] wore a funny headgear that looked like a Japanese man's head, with a switch on the nose that could move the eyebrows up and down.
1:27:56|1:28:8|[Qin Fen] saw [Liang Xiaoxiao] at the door while adjusting the headgear switch. Dressed in a funny manner, [Qin Fen] ran up to [Liang Xiaoxiao] and twisted his head, making [Liang Xiaoxiao] couldn't help but laugh.
1:28:9|1:28:42|[Qin Fen] held hands with [Liang Xiaoxiao] and joined in the fun with everyone. After a joyful night at the izakaya, the next day the three of them drove to a church in the suburbs. This time, [Qin Fen] and [Liang Xiaoxiao] were both in the back seat, with [Qin Fen] and [Wu Sang] humming local songs in the car.
1:29:6|1:29:18|Beside him, [Liang Xiaoxiao] stifled a laugh and said,
1:31:1|1:31:21|The vehicle passed through a large expanse of sunflower fields, with the distant brown mountains and forests complementing each other, creating a golden world under the setting sun. Before long, the car stopped on the road, with no signs of human presence for miles around. A two-story small house stood prominently on the vast grassland.
1:32:7|1:32:13|Wu Sang then led Qin Fen into the church. After a brief conversation with the priest, Wu Sang walked out of the church, leaving Qin Fen alone.
1:32:30|1:32:35|[Qin Fen] walked over and knelt in front of the godfather, placing his hands on the Bible.
1:32:40|1:32:52|After the godfather completed the basic confession ceremony, he said to [Qin Fen], "Let's begin."
1:33:16|1:33:24|Wu Sang, waiting outside the church, came out of the car and handed a cup of water to Liang Xiaoxiao. Liang Xiaoxiao took it with a smile and the two started chatting.
1:33:56|1:33:59|After listening, [Liang Xiaoxiao] thought for a moment and said,
1:34:21|1:34:28|[Liang Xiaoxiao] turned around and looked at the scenery without saying a word.
1:34:59|1:35:3|[Wu Sang] listened and then walked to the other side of the car, took out a cigarette and lit it up.
1:35:38|1:36:2|The time on the clock has passed for more than two hours, [Qin Fen] is still kneeling in front of the godfather confessing quietly. The godfather with gray hair stood up, sweating profusely, physically and mentally exhausted, unable to stand any longer. He helplessly found a chair to sit down and massaged his legs.
1:36:2|1:36:10|The setting sun shines on Liang Xiaoxiao's face as she lowers her head to look at the watch on her wrist.
1:37:40|1:37:45|Time passes by minute by minute, and even the sun is about to set soon.
1:37:52|1:38:3|Wu Sang and Liang Xiaoxiao, who had been waiting outside, also fell asleep in the car. The frustrated godfather couldn't take it anymore and ran out to wake them up.
1:38:52|1:39:3|[Qin Fen] was still talking excitedly. As the three of them were driving in the car, [Wu Sang] joked,
1:39:47|1:40:17|The vehicle continued to drive on the road, and by the time the three arrived at the island, it was already evening. After resting for a night, they boarded the island the next day. The island had beautiful surroundings, surrounded by the sea, lush vegetation, and fresh air. However, [Liang Xiaoxiao] seemed restless. [Wu Sang] and [Qin Fen] found a hot spring.
1:40:29|1:40:32|After listening, [Qin Fen] looked around for [Liang Xiaoxiao].
1:40:33|1:40:48|At this moment, [Liang Xiaoxiao] stood still with a blank expression, tears visible on her face. Worried, [Qin Fen] ran over and pulled [Liang Xiaoxiao] away.
1:41:10|1:41:29|Two backpack-carrying hikers approached, and [Wu Sang] stepped forward to ask. One of the hikers, looking flustered, said,
1:41:42|1:41:46|The hiker burst into laughter after seeing the expression on [Qin Fen]'s face.
1:41:57|1:42:13|[Qin Fen], along with two others and the tourists on the island, started playing a game called "Here Comes the Bear". [Qin Fen] dressed up in a bear costume to play the bear. The rules of the game were that everyone had to lie on the ground, and if the bear managed to flip someone over, that person had to immediately return to their original position. The game began.
1:42:13|1:42:39|Xiong approached [Liang Xiaoxiao], turned her over, patted her with his paw, sniffed her with his nose, and occasionally made low growling sounds, like a real bear.
1:42:58|1:43:14|[Qin Fen] lay on his side next to [Liang Xiaoxiao], placing his hand on her belly, and whispered, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] rested her hand on [Qin Fen]'s bear-like paw.
1:43:43|1:44:2|After the game ended, [Qin Fen] and [Liang Xiaoxiao] arrived at the seaside. The sea breeze felt particularly cold on the vast cliff edge. [Liang Xiaoxiao] nodded, and seeing that she was unwilling to move, [Qin Fen] took off his coat and draped it over her.
1:44:12|1:44:23|Liang Xiaoxiao saw Qin Fen trying to light a cigarette after putting on his coat.
1:44:24|1:44:38|[Qin Fen] declined, glanced at [Liang Xiaoxiao], and then handed her the cigarette case and lighter. [Liang Xiaoxiao] lowered her head to take a puff, while [Qin Fen] cooperatively used his jacket to block the wind.
1:44:41|1:44:50|After lighting a cigarette, [Liang Xiaoxiao] took a puff and passed the cigarette to [Qin Fen]. [Qin Fen] took the cigarette, glanced at it, and then smoked while looking at the sea.
1:44:50|1:45:14|[Liang Xiaoxiao] leaned her head on [Qin Fen]'s shoulder, [Qin Fen] glanced at [Liang Xiaoxiao] and then turned back. The two of them snuggled up to each other in silence. After a while, [Liang Xiaoxiao] spoke up.
1:45:29|1:45:52|[Liang Xiaoxiao] nodded and replied, turning her head to the side. She slightly raised her head and looked into the distance, asking [Qin Fen],
1:46:2|1:46:23|[Liang Xiaoxiao] looked at [Qin Fen] with a determined gaze without blinking. After listening, [Liang Xiaoxiao] leaned on [Qin Fen]'s shoulder with her eyes closed, recalling the scene of her and Wang Xin at this place.
1:46:25|1:46:35|She was lying on Wang Xin's chest and asked,
1:47:23|1:47:31|Back in reality, [Liang Xiaoxiao] went alone to the hot spring in the woods. She took off her clothes and placed them on a nearby rock before walking down.
1:47:33|1:47:44|In the vast forest, she was the only one soaking in the hot spring. Back at the hotel, Liang Xiaoxiao wrote a letter to Qin Fen in her room.
1:49:11|1:49:16|[Liang Xiaoxiao] slipped the written letter through the crack in the door.
1:49:20|1:49:28|After Liang Xiaoxiao left, Qin Fen came to the cliff where she used to promise to marry her.
1:49:34|1:49:43|From the hillside to the cliff edge, there was not a hint of expression on [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s face, and one could not sense any hesitation in her firm and steady steps.
1:49:54|1:49:59|[Liang Xiaoxiao] stepped over the low fence and stood at the closest point to the edge of the cliff.
1:50:2|1:50:21|She looked out at the calm ocean in the distance, her eyes unusually dim. After a moment, she leaped into the sea.
1:50:26|1:50:48|In the sea, [Liang Xiaoxiao] remained calm, with her eyes closed and mouth slightly open, bubbles occasionally coming out from her mouth and nostrils. Her body was completely relaxed, showing no signs of struggle. Her hair and scarf swayed gently in the water as it flowed.
1:51:8|1:51:17|The next day, [Qin Fen] and [Wu Sang], who woke up, drove to the seaside after seeing the letter, and the two of them did not speak all the way in the car.
1:51:18|1:51:51|At the seaside, Qin Fen met the police officer who was dealing with the situation. Qin Fen sat on the railing with his hands in his pockets, watching Liang Xiaoxiao jump into the sea. The grass beside Qin Fen swayed gently in the sea breeze. After Wu Sang and the police officer understood the situation, they said to Qin Fen,
1:51:55|1:52:5|[Qin Fen] looked down at the sea, taking a while to come back to his senses.
1:52:16|1:52:29|After finishing talking, the two stood up and headed to the hospital. Inside the hospital, a nurse pulled back the curtain.
1:52:30|1:52:56|The two saw [Liang Xiaoxiao] lying on the hospital bed, her arms and legs wrapped in bandages, breathing through an oxygen machine without moving. [Qin Fen] walked up to the bed, looking at [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s bright eyes, which seemed vacant. Sitting down, [Qin Fen] sighed, touched [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s hand, and said,
1:53:2|1:53:23|At this moment, a tear rolled down the corner of [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s eye, and [Qin Fen] stood up to wipe it away for her.
1:53:26|1:53:45|Outside the hospital, [Wu Sang] was smoking, and the two of them remained silent for a while. After a moment of silence, [Wu Sang] bid farewell to [Qin Fen].
1:54:2|1:54:12|[Qin Fen] took out an envelope of money from his pocket,
1:54:20|1:54:30|After speaking, [Wu Sang] handed the money to [Qin Fen], who then placed the envelope in the car.
1:55:1|1:55:14|[Wu Sang] watched [Qin Fen]'s back in the car. [Qin Fen] wiped away a tear with one hand and waved with the other. On their separate ways back, [Wu Sang] and [Qin Fen] sang a Japanese song about cherishing friendship.
1:56:35|1:57:24|[Wu Sang] parked the car by the roadside, crying. After calming down, [Wu Sang] continued on the journey, the car gradually disappearing from view. Some time later, [Liang Xiaoxiao] recovered from her injuries and left the hospital with [Qin Fen].
1:57:24|1:57:40|Liang Xiaoxiao, who has not fully recovered, sits in a wheelchair while Qin Fen pushes her from behind on a cruise ship, preparing to return to their country. On the huge cruise ship, Qin Fen pushes Liang Xiaoxiao out onto the deck to get some fresh air.
1:57:55|1:57:59|[Liang Xiaoxiao] took the phone and dialed Wang Xin's number.
1:58:48|1:58:54|[Qin Fen] understood [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s words and kissed her.
1:59:5|1:59:13|[Qin Fen] stopped and looked towards the other side after hearing these words, while [Mr. Fan] was selling the divisive terminal device by the pool.
2:0:18|2:1:1|[Mr. Fan], dressed in a disposable bathrobe and slippers, despondently holds a divergence terminal in his hand as he walks step by step towards the edge of the boat. Once at the edge, [Mr. Fan] raises the divergence terminal high, preparing to throw it away. At that moment, a voice is heard from behind. [Mr. Fan] slowly turns around, and with a tearful voice, he says,
2:1:3|2:1:21|[Qin Fen] watched as he nodded earnestly, while [Mr. Fan] continued to hold up the divergent terminal device and weep bitterly. [Qin Fen] wiped away his tears and embraced him.
