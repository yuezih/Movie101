0:0:51|0:0:57|[Old Li] brought food and poured it into the cat's bowl, gently stroking the cat's body. The cat alertly dodged for a moment.
0:0:59|0:1:4|Seeing the kitten eating eagerly, [Old Li] sat up straight and shouted back into the house.
0:1:6|0:1:29|A Samoyed slowly stuck out its body, while Lai Xi quickened its pace and ran straight towards [Old Li]. Lai Xi stared solemnly at the kitten, which arched its back in response.
0:1:47|0:1:56|Lai Xi raised his front paws, [Old Li] carried the kitten into the house, while Lai Xi closely followed [Old Li]'s steps.
0:1:58|0:2:6|Several neighbors gathered around the table inside the house, playing mahjong.
0:2:58|0:3:26|Four elderly people left the mahjong table chatting and laughing, while Xi lay lazily in the sun at the door. [Old Li] sat quietly in the living room, the background noise from the TV was a bit loud. He got up to turn off the TV, then began to tidy up the messy mahjong table as usual. His heavy clothes made his movements a bit awkward, and he slowly walked to the door with a somewhat vacant expression.
0:3:26|0:3:36|He took off his reading glasses and looked up at the sky, where several fireworks suddenly burst, breaking the silence of the county town. The scene shifted, marking the end of the opening credits of the movie.
0:3:36|0:3:48|The film tells the generation gap between three generations of a family. The daughter, who has been living in Beijing for 14 years, returns to her hometown with her granddaughter who studied in the United States after learning about her father's early signs of Alzheimer's disease.
0:4:4|0:4:8|The story, which is both funny and touching, unexpectedly unfolds from this reunion.
0:4:9|0:4:21|Director Gao Qunshu expressed that the creation of this film is to convey true emotions. He has always wanted to shoot a comedy, but not the kind with only jokes. He wants to present the audience with a funny and heartwarming movie.
0:4:21|0:4:32|The New Year should be full of joy and harmony. The film starts with a very small perspective, focusing on a small family, but the scale it presents is very large.
0:4:32|0:4:42|The film reveals the changes in social relationships, conflicts between the old and the new, and collisions of various emerging cultures. It not only brings back the long-lost traditional atmosphere for the audience, but also allows them to reexamine their surrounding lives.
0:4:44|0:4:53|The theme of celebrating the Chinese New Year ultimately boils down to everyone being well. The film does not blindly follow trends, but instead infuses the film with comedic charm through its language.
0:4:55|0:5:9|The charm of the lines brings people back to the most traditional New Year's films. The whole story is full of humor, with twists and turns in creating dramatic conflicts. Various contradictions come together, ultimately bringing joy to the audience.
0:5:9|0:5:15|The film adopts a segmented narrative structure, with a total of 5 acts. The first act starts at Old Li's hometown.
0:5:33|0:5:48|The festive atmosphere warms up the small town in winter. However, Old Li's courtyard appears even more desolate in contrast. Old Li slowly pushes his cart out of the house and soon arrives at the market.
0:6:30|0:6:42|[Old Li] walked while waving his hand, sighing at the clever tricks of the street vendors, and continued walking forward. A person with a knife in hand and wearing headphones,
0:6:42|0:6:59|The emotionally singing female boss caught the attention of [Old Li]. She sang with great passion, lost in her own voice, completely unaware of [Old Li]'s gaze. [Old Li] carefully observed the female boss, and in the depths of his emotions, he couldn't help but applaud.
0:9:48|0:10:4|After the female boss finished speaking and made a gesture of invitation, she started singing on her own, ignoring [Old Li], with the air of a soprano in a music hall. [Old Li] shouted angrily,
0:10:4|0:10:20|The two of them stayed in place, deciding not to buy the chicken after all. [Old Li] remained silent, with an angry expression on his face, as he pulled the small cart away. The female boss continued to sing loudly, perhaps too captivating, unable to resist applauding herself.
0:10:20|0:10:36|Old Li arrived at the entrance of the market in no time. A delivery van zoomed past him, followed closely by an electric bike. Startled, he took two steps back, looked up to check the traffic, and once confirmed it was safe, he continued walking.
0:10:36|0:10:52|The brightly dressed yangko dance troupe passed by, but [Old Li] was too busy to appreciate it. He hurriedly crossed the road after the troupe, and the festive music brought a smile to his face, which quickly disappeared.
0:10:52|0:11:4|The bus slowly pulls into the station from a distance, and [Old Li] looks back at the departing yangko dance troupe with a hint of nostalgia. The bus stops, and [Old Li] also gets on, heading home.
0:11:5|0:11:9|During the Chinese New Year, the city of Beijing is still bustling with traffic.
0:12:10|0:12:25|[Li Yangduo] sat in the car watching Siqi pushing the luggage to catch the plane. Her expression was serious, her eyes somewhat absent-minded. She watched Siqi walk slowly past the car, pursed her lips, but ultimately didn't call out. She parked the car and entered the airport lobby.
0:13:6|0:13:14|The scene cuts to the county town, where [Old Li] stands on the platform of the train station, craning his neck to look at the train pulling in, while the police officer [Shen Qiang] strides quickly towards him.
0:15:28|0:15:32|[Li Yangduo] listened without saying a word, turned on the turn signal and drove towards the ramp.
0:15:38|0:15:44|[Zhu Li] let out a long howl to the sky, then called her friend to vent.
0:16:24|0:16:32|With a loud crash, the mother and daughter stopped fighting. [Li Yangduo] covered her daughter's mouth with her hand and quickly got off the car to check the situation.
0:17:17|0:17:30|[Li Yangduo] hurried back to the car to get money, [Zhu Li] took the opportunity to slip away, [Li Yangduo] quickly rushed towards [Zhu Li] and grabbed her.
0:17:39|0:18:0|The camera cuts back to Shimen County town with the sound of music, in a black and white slow-motion scene, a teddy bear with its ears perked up, running aimlessly on the street, next to its owner, a young woman from the county town, holding spring couplets in her hands and running freely, with a happy smile on her face.
0:18:2|0:18:17|Teddy followed his owner's footsteps closely, occasionally looking up at him. The couplet swayed in the wind, just like the leisurely and comfortable life in the county town. At this moment, in Shen Qiang's police car,
0:19:16|0:19:21|Shen Qiang slammed on the brakes.
0:19:23|0:19:40|With cheerful music playing, three stylish urban women appeared on the screen, linking arms and running forward together, creating a picturesque scene. Suddenly, a series of rapid firecrackers interrupted this moment of beauty.
0:19:43|0:20:4|The farce ends with the sound of music, and the film moves to the second act. The streets of Shimen County are deserted, with only sanitation workers still working, and various small cars parked on both sides of the road. [Zhu Li] has already returned to her hometown with [Li Yangduo], holding her phone and constantly changing directions to find a signal, her expression slightly anxious.
0:20:13|0:20:25|She touched her chest, coming back to her senses from the previous shock, and then walked into a van filled with goods. The boss [Xiao Tian] was wearing headphones and staring at the computer screen, laughing foolishly.
0:21:21|0:21:42|In the room, [Li Yangduo] and [Old Li] sat facing each other. [Old Li] was breathing heavily, perhaps feeling uncomfortable under his daughter's sharp gaze. After speaking, he took off his hat and touched his face.
0:24:21|0:24:52|Without looking back, [Old Li] entered the bedroom and shouted. After not receiving a response for a long time, he seemed impatient and suddenly stood up from the sofa and walked towards the bedroom, but every two steps he took, he froze in place.
0:26:0|0:26:9|The music fades out, and the film enters the third act. [Old Li] is already busy in the kitchen. Despite his old age, his knife skills are still sharp.
0:26:9|0:26:32|Old Li skillfully sliced the ginger and scallions, cut various ingredients into different sizes, put them in containers of various sizes for later use, grabbed a fish and quickly cleaned the scales, then made various cuts on the fish's back. There were also some uncommon ingredients like sea cucumber and abalone among the food items.
0:26:33|0:26:42|Outside the kitchen, [Li Yangduo] has put up festive couplets inside and outside the house, with big lanterns hanging from the eaves.
0:26:54|0:27:0|Li Yangduo went straight to the kitchen after finishing her work.
0:27:19|0:27:26|[Li Yangduo] put down her left hand and slowly raised her right hand, staring at [Old Li] in surprise.
0:28:12|0:28:27|Chopsticks stirring constantly in the pot, food rolling in the boiling oil, [Old Li] nervously watching the stove, afraid that his daughter might make a mistake again.
0:28:29|0:28:36|Before long, the food was ready, and [Old Li] picked up a piece to taste.
0:32:10|0:32:16|The camera cuts to outside the house with the sound of music, [Zhu Li] is sitting excitedly in front of the computer.
0:32:44|0:33:3|Xiao Tian was busy unloading the goods and didn't have time to pay attention to her. At this moment, Zhu Li's good friend passed by, and Zhu Li hurried out to greet her.
0:34:9|0:34:17|Old Li heard the sound and entered the room.
0:34:58|0:35:6|But blocked by three big men carrying gifts.
0:35:43|0:35:49|[Da Hai] stood still, looking somewhat unnatural, and took off his reflective sunglasses.
0:39:32|0:39:38|[Zhu Li] kissed [Da Hai] on the cheek, which made [Old Li] immediately anxious.
0:41:31|0:41:35|Old Li burped right after he finished speaking.
0:41:48|0:41:55|[Old Li] looked at everyone with a dazed expression.
0:43:27|0:43:35|[Da Hai] was asked a question and seemed a bit stunned, for a moment not knowing how to answer.
0:45:27|0:45:39|[Xiao Mi] made a gesture of 10 and mouthed the word "million". As the music played, the lively scene in the small house came to an end. In Donggaoliang Hutong, the daily lives of the extraordinary people continued.
0:46:2|0:46:5|Passing by Xiao Tian's small convenience store van, Xiao Tian heard the sound and stealthily followed behind the goddess Zhu Li.
0:46:26|0:46:34|The goddess glanced at [Xiao Tian] running away, then immersed herself in her own world and looked ahead.
0:46:35|0:46:47|The familiar music played again, firecrackers exploded in the van, and [Zhu Li] approached.
0:47:31|0:47:39|[Zhu Li] felt a bit embarrassed, but still accepted the three cigarettes, then left without looking back.
0:48:3|0:48:11|The sudden shout caught Goddess off guard, but she quickly recovered and the two warmly offered their blessings. Act Four.
0:48:11|0:48:30|Time flew by and it was already afternoon. The setting sun brought a hint of warmth to the small town. [Old Li] was still busy in the kitchen, rhythmically chopping the minced meat on the cutting board with a knife. He quickly rolled the long dough into a small lump, flattened it with a rolling pin, and filled it with a generous amount of minced meat.
0:48:30|0:48:44|With a strong pinch of both hands, the dumplings were quickly spread out on the table. [Li Yangduo] sat on the sofa in the room, idly holding a glass of water to pass the time, and unexpectedly looked up to see [Zhu Heping] standing outside the door.
0:49:39|0:49:54|[Li Yangduo] tugged hard against [Zhu Heping], finally pulling the zipper open. She instinctively reached out to take his coat as he was about to remove it, and gestured for him to take off his scarf. After straightening out his clothes, [Zhu Heping] walked towards his daughter.
0:50:6|0:50:12|[Zhu Li] quickly fled the room with a tablet in her arms, while [Li Yangduo] had a big smile on her face.
0:50:14|0:50:29|[Zhu Heping] got up and pointed towards the kitchen, then walked out of the room with his head down, leaving [Li Yangduo] standing still in place. [Zhu Heping] walked into the kitchen.
0:51:7|0:51:17|You were chattering away, completely unaware that [Old Li] had already reached the doorway of the room.
0:52:27|0:52:33|[Zhu Heping] holds [Old Li]'s hand with a very sincere attitude,
0:53:0|0:53:7|He was momentarily at a loss for words on how to refute.
0:56:20|0:56:51|[Old Li] was furious, stood up in one go, and pointed at [Li Yangduo]. [Zhu Heping] quickly handed the ladle to [Old Li]. [Old Li] vigorously shook the wok spatula, and the already damaged spatula broke with a sound. [Li Yangduo] stood with hands on hips, glaring at [Old Li] as if in a huff.
0:56:52|0:56:56|[Zhu Heping] placed both hands on [Old Li]'s shoulders, constantly comforting him.
0:56:57|0:57:18|[Old Li] glanced back at [Zhu Heping], then turned his gaze to [Li Yangduo], walked out angrily, causing the two inside the room to shake involuntarily, snapping back to reality. They each looked at each other sideways, creating a somewhat awkward atmosphere.
0:57:32|0:57:40|[Zhu Li] was at a loss for words for a moment, as she slowly reached out and held the hands of [Zhu Heping] and [Li Yangduo].
0:58:14|0:58:27|[Zhu Li] stopped walking back to the house, turned around and linked arms with [Zhu Heping], walking towards the door. In the blink of an eye, they were already outside the door.
0:59:40|0:59:54|The camera cuts back to the door, with [Li Yangduo] leaning against the door frame with a vacant look in her eyes. The lively laughter of her daughter and Sun Wukong outside fails to pique her interest. Sun Wukong's sudden appearance has left her deeply shaken.
0:59:57|1:0:12|She suddenly chuckled involuntarily, tears also uncontrollably streaming down her face. She hurriedly covered her face with a scarf as the music started playing. As the sky darkened, [Li Yangduo] lounged on the sofa with her legs crossed, one hand supporting her chin and the other playing with her phone.
1:0:52|1:1:19|In the bedroom, [Zhu Li] was holding a tablet and video chatting with her girlfriend. Suddenly, she felt nauseous and quickly took off her earphones to look for a trash can. Her girlfriend on the other end of the video was getting anxious, calling [Zhu Li]'s name repeatedly. After dry heaving for a while, [Zhu Li] finally started to feel better. She covered her mouth and ran back to the bedroom, picked up her phone from the bed, didn't have time to talk to her girlfriend, and returned to the trash can.
1:1:19|1:1:32|Continuously swiping on the phone with her eyes fixed on the screen. Another bout of violent retching, she simply sat on the floor and opened Pete's chat page.
1:1:34|1:1:42|Two voice messages were sent out but received no response. She then opened her contacts and found Pete's phone number, dialing it without hesitation.
1:1:45|1:1:51|Old Li is currently flipping a wok in the kitchen,
1:5:17|1:5:34|[Xiao Tian] The boss and the goddess finished their rap battle, and another beautiful woman passed by the convenience store. [Xiao Tian] jumped off the car, and the woman turned back to look at him with a hint of blame and anger in her eyes.
1:5:48|1:5:53|The beauty raised her hand forward, [Xiao Tian] was scared and kept retreating.
1:6:5|1:6:19|In the fifth act of the film, night falls along with darkness, the quiet alley devoid of any pedestrians, a stark contrast to the bustling scene at noon.
1:6:20|1:6:36|A delivery van slowly drives into the alley and stops behind the convenience store. [Old Li] gets off the van, wraps himself in a scarf, limps into the store, and then reaches out to tap on the car window.
1:6:36|1:6:56|There was no response in the car. The reunion of families illuminated the alleys on New Year's Eve, and the lonely [Old Li] at this moment also felt a deep longing for his family. He dragged his heavy steps into the car step by step. The boss [Xiao Tian] was wearing headphones and watching a female anchor sing, and the background noise seemed particularly noisy at this moment.
1:6:56|1:7:3|Old Li passed by behind Xiao Tian and quietly curled up in the corner of the van. The work in the kitchen was almost finished.
1:7:3|1:7:18|The ingredients, stir-fried at high temperature, display an enticing color. [Old Li] skillfully plates the dish, then opens the lid of the pot filled with sour cabbage. The thick soup keeps boiling, and the hot steam fills the entire room like a fragrance.
1:9:46|1:9:54|The delivery man in the corner heard the conversation between the two and stood up stiffly, while Xiao Tian dashed towards the TV like lightning.
1:10:11|1:10:34|In the blink of an eye, [Xiao Tian] had already reached the van with the TV in his arms. The weight of the old TV made it difficult for [Xiao Tian], and after several attempts, he couldn't get the TV into the van. The delivery driver drove closer in the small car, stopped in front of the van, and stared at [Xiao Tian] without offering to help. Instead, he gave him a heavy pat on the back. [Xiao Tian] placed the TV on the ground.
1:10:34|1:10:50|The delivery man opened the car door, took out a new LCD TV and put it into [Xiao Tian]'s arms, then pointed to the direction of the door to signal him to move it in. The delivery man bent down, lifted the old TV from the ground, and struggled to squeeze it into the delivery car.
1:11:2|1:11:14|[Old Li] greeted everyone to sit at the dining table in festive cotton clothes. The person next to him tapped [Zhu Li], and [Old Li] gestured for [Zhu Li] to take off her earphones.
1:11:55|1:12:2|[Xiao Tian] was getting a little impatient with the questions.
1:12:33|1:12:40|[Li Yangduo] snatched the tablet from [Zhu Li], as [Old Li] raised his glass to speak, but [Zhu Li] suddenly got up and rushed to the restroom, covering her mouth.
1:12:49|1:12:59|After settling Zhu Li, Pete returned to the dining table. Li Yangduo and Old Li stood still in place after listening.
1:13:7|1:13:20|Pete's expression was full of helplessness, with [Old Li] and [Li Yangduo] looking bewildered, staring intently at [Zhu Li] walking out of the restroom, locking her in with sharp eyes.
1:13:47|1:13:54|Xiao Tian didn't hesitate, picking up the chopsticks and stuffing food into his mouth. Old Li raised his glass and drank it all in one gulp, then slammed the glass heavily on the table.
1:14:9|1:14:17|Li Yangduo's gaze has been fixed on Zhu Li. At this moment, Li Yangduo can't hold back anymore.
1:14:48|1:14:54|[Zhu Li] dropped her chopsticks and stood up.
1:15:10|1:15:36|[Li Yangduo] widened her eyes after listening. She saw [Old Li] drinking quietly, one glass after another, without saying a word. The air seemed to freeze, everyone was silent, and even [Xiao Tian] stopped eating, staring at [Zhu Li] in surprise. [Zhu Li] put down the food in her hand, paused, and continued speaking.
1:17:6|1:17:37|Two loud slaps landed on Zhu Li's face, scaring Pete next to her to step back repeatedly. Zhu Li laughed indifferently, even as her passport was torn to pieces. Li Yangduo covered her face and wept, her body suddenly losing strength, making it difficult for her to stand steady. Xiao Tian stood there with chopsticks in hand, looking at Zhu Li in confusion.
1:17:38|1:17:48|After listening, [Li Yangduo] absentmindedly reached out to pick up the dish. Her emotions became more and more unstable, and she staggered towards the bedroom. [Old Li] furrowed his brow, silently refilling his glass with wine.
1:18:18|1:18:26|The two's emotions gradually calmed down, while [Old Li] continued to drink sullenly with his head tilted back.
1:18:38|1:18:51|Caressing [Zhu Li]'s face, then gently wiping away [Zhu Li]'s tears with his hand, his eyes full of affection. Suddenly, a strong sense of nausea interrupted their actions, and Peter quickly followed [Zhu Li] into the bathroom.
1:19:13|1:19:20|The empty room fell into a silent darkness, the liveliness was gone, and the noise was gone.
1:19:21|1:19:36|The lavish reunion dinner table was filled, engulfed by darkness. [Old Li] lit a candle, the dim candlelight reflecting on his face, looking somewhat lonely. He walked with heavy steps.
1:19:36|1:19:57|Approaching the dining table slowly from the corner of the room, [Old Li] casually picks up a plate. With the help of dim light, every move of [Old Li] seems so cautious. In no time, the plate is filled with various dishes. Meanwhile, deliveryman [Aaron] also limps his way to [Old Li]'s house.
1:19:57|1:20:4|[Li Yangduo] relies on crying on the sofa, completely indifferent to the sudden darkness. [Old Li] holds a plate in one hand,
1:20:4|1:20:29|With a candle in one hand, [Xiao Tian] arrived outside the memorial hall of his late partner. He and [Old Li] were using a flashlight to carefully inspect the electrical circuit malfunction at [Old Li]'s home. [Old Li] leaned against the table, staring blankly at the memorial tablet for a moment before continuing to speak.
1:21:35|1:21:43|[Old Li] adjusted his glasses and picked up the glass of wine in front of him.
1:21:46|1:22:7|At this moment, he was feeling heavy-hearted, only wanting to chat with his deceased old partner. As the wine in the cup was spilled on the ground, [Old Li] fell into silence again. After tidying up his emotions, [Old Li] returned to the dining table and suddenly bright lights illuminated the small house.
1:22:9|1:22:17|[Old Li] finished repairing the electrical circuit and returned to the van. [Old Li] stared at the dining table in confusion.
1:22:18|1:22:25|As if completely forgetting that he cooked the meal on the table himself, as if nothing had happened just now. He scanned the room,
1:22:28|1:22:42|Scratching his head, Old Li tried hard to remember if he had celebrated the New Year. His hand fumbled in his clothes, then took out a few red envelopes from his pocket.
1:22:54|1:23:11|In the bedroom, [Li Yangduo] listened to [Old Li]'s muttering to himself, and then thought of his daughter who had returned from studying abroad and was already pregnant and dropping out of school, causing his emotions to collapse once again. [Old Li] held up the phone that wasn't connected.
1:23:13|1:23:16|Glued to his ear, seeing no response, he brought the phone back to his eyes and stared at the screen.
1:24:9|1:24:17|After speaking, he slumped back in the chair and let out a heavy sigh.
1:24:18|1:24:31|Looking at the table full of dishes, he picked up the red envelopes again and stood up. He distributed the red envelopes one by one on the table.
1:24:41|1:25:6|After finishing these tasks, [Old Li] was ready to leave. The room was empty, with only the food on the stove bubbling with steam. Soon, [Old Li] arrived at the front door. He put on his coat, wore his hat, and as he stepped over the threshold, he accidentally tripped and almost fell.
1:25:10|1:25:25|On New Year's Eve, the alley was deserted, and no one knew where [Old Li] could go after leaving home. [Xiao Tian] watched the live broadcast in the van, despite wearing thick clothes, the late-night cold still made him tighten his scarf.
1:25:26|1:25:32|[Old Li] still lay in the corner, staring blankly at the roof, lost in his own thoughts.
1:25:34|1:25:46|[Old Li] passed by a restaurant where a group of people were gathered around a table, enjoying their meal and drinks with laughter and chatter. [Old Li] quickly glanced over and continued walking forward.
1:26:27|1:26:48|The sanitation worker greeted [Old Li] warmly. In the bedroom of [Old Li]'s house, [Li Yangduo] was still immersed in the pain from earlier, her eyes red and swollen from crying. It had been a while since she checked on [Old Li], so she couldn't help but feel a bit worried. After composing herself, she stopped crying and prepared to see what [Old Li] was up to.
1:26:48|1:27:16|At this moment, [Old Li] has been away from home for a long time. [Li Yangduo] is getting anxious, not seeing [Old Li] anywhere inside or outside. She realizes something is wrong, so she quickens her pace, calling out as she runs. Pete hears the calls and quickly comes out to search for [Old Li] together. [Zhu Li] is also feeling a bit panicked.
1:28:1|1:28:11|All of a sudden, everyone rushed out, calling urgently for [Old Li].
1:28:11|1:28:36|No one has ever seen [Old Li]. It's so difficult to find a missing old man in this big county town. [Xiao Tian] and [Li Yangduo] also joined the search team. [Li Yangduo] quickly started the van, and [Xiao Tian] signaled for them to get in. Everyone mobilized their relatives and friends to search together.
1:29:1|1:29:17|[Xiao Tian] shouted loudly out of the car window. [Zhu Li] also posted a missing person notice on Weibo.
1:29:43|1:29:50|The missing person notice sank without a trace, as everyone was immersed in their own joy, welcoming the arrival of the new year together.
1:29:52|1:29:56|Outside, it was snowing heavily, but [Old Li] still hadn't received any news.
1:31:12|1:31:21|With the help of [Zhu Li], the missing person notice started to be widely shared on Weibo, and prominent missing person notices were being broadcasted on every TV in every household.
1:31:22|1:31:39|At this moment, the Northeastern elderly man with dementia who went missing on New Year's Eve has touched the hearts of hundreds of millions of people across the country. For every Chinese person, New Year's Eve is a day of family reunion. The united strength of the Chinese people at this moment has formed a strong bond.
1:31:39|1:31:54|Although they didn't know [Old Li], they contributed their meager efforts to this unfamiliar old man through the forwarded Weibo posts. [Zhu Li] had already cried her eyes out while looking at her phone. Meanwhile, Yao Chen was also talking to her mother.
1:32:23|1:32:37|Just now, the sanitation worker was standing in the snow with a child, eating. She held a steaming lunchbox in her arms, looking heart-wrenching, but because she had family with her,
1:32:39|1:32:47|The meal seemed to become more enjoyable. The snow was falling heavier, and the mother and son were sending voice messages to their family by the sanitation truck.
1:32:48|1:33:10|It might be a coincidence, she also saw the missing person notice that was being widely shared. She tried hard to remember the person she had just met, it turned out that when [Old Li] passed by her, she even greeted [Old Li]. She immediately spread the message.
1:33:10|1:33:39|Soon, Zhu Li received messages from netizens on her phone. Old Li nodded repeatedly upon hearing the news, gesturing to Li Yangduo, and immediately accelerated towards the direction of the train station with everyone.
1:34:2|1:34:10|Just as everyone was overjoyed to find [Old Li], [Master Li] knelt down with tears in his eyes.
1:34:13|1:34:20|[Old Li] took off his mask, unable to hide the excitement in his heart.
1:34:21|1:34:36|Hearing this name [Old Li] also felt a bit surreal, staring at [Li Ermao] kneeling on the ground with wide eyes. [Li Ermao] took off his hat, looked up at [Old Li] for a moment, then quickly lowered his head, not daring to look again. After so many years,
