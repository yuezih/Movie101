0:2:59|0:3:10|[Geng Hao] took off his goggles and threw them on the table, picked up the cigarette next to him, lit one in his mouth. On his bare forearm, the words "quit smoking" were neatly tattooed, [Geng Hao] sighed, picked up a pen and leaned it on the table.
0:3:29|0:3:36|The man awkwardly pointed at the furnishings inside the room as he spoke.
0:3:56|0:4:4|[Geng Hao] dodges the man trying to take the agreement document.
0:4:19|0:4:38|The man finished speaking, raised his head and left the room on tiptoe. The clever little dog by the bed imitated the man's slight waist movements as it walked. After the man left, [Geng Hao] angrily crumpled the contract and threw it out, staring at the paper ball that was brought back by the dog.
0:4:38|0:4:59|[Geng Hao] was panting heavily, the scene shifted to outside an apartment building, with the damp ground littered with countless cigarette butts. [Geng Hao] leaned against the railing, clutching a bottle of liquor and swallowing continuously. The car behind him caught his attention, he turned back to take a look. After seeing the faces of the people in the car clearly, [Geng Hao] turned his head and took a few deep drags of his cigarette.
0:5:0|0:5:19|He looked at the man getting out of the car, only to see the man tall and straight, locking the car and walking towards the apartment next to [Geng Hao]. [Geng Hao] clicked his tongue, picked up the cigarette in his hand, and walked towards the apartment door at the end of the railing. There was a hammer hanging on his belt, glinting coldly under the streetlight.
0:5:19|0:5:38|[Geng Hao] pulled out a hammer hidden behind him, slowly moving forward along the railing. He was getting closer and closer to the man in front of him when he remembered to put on his winter hat. Just as he raised the hammer to make a move, the man suddenly turned around, and [Geng Hao] quickly put away the hammer.
0:5:45|0:6:0|He had a hammer in his pocket, but took out a lighter from his pants pocket. He walked over with his hand outstretched and stood in front of the man. [Geng Hao]'s hand froze in mid-air. The man seemed accustomed to being lit by others. He leaned slightly towards the lighter, and [Geng Hao] lit his cigarette with a dark expression.
0:6:2|0:6:7|After several attempts, the flame finally burst out after the valve was turned up.
0:6:10|0:6:17|[Geng Hao] struggled to open his mouth, but ultimately lacked the courage to speak. His arm holding the lighter drooped weakly.
0:6:19|0:6:42|After a long sigh, the hammer also fell to the ground. Needless to say, the man just now is the third party in Geng Hao's marriage. By chance, he caught a glimpse of the convenience store clerk across the street recording him with a phone. Geng Hao was momentarily unsure whether to regret or to carry on. The scene shifts to the hospital lobby.
0:6:42|0:6:50|[Geng Hao] was violently vomiting, burying his head in the gap of the corridor, while his friend [Hao Yi] took a photo of him.
0:7:6|0:7:12|[Hao Yi] sat down on the bench, his eyes flickering as he watched the nurse place her hand in his lap.
0:7:50|0:7:55|[Hao Yi] was stunned as he watched [Geng Hao] crazily tearing into a pig's trotter.
0:8:4|0:8:23|After a powerless outburst, the hall was in a mess. [Geng Hao] huddled in [Hao Yi]'s arms, sobbing. Alcohol guided his sorrow to vent out.
0:8:24|0:8:33|At this moment, he had greasy hair and a strong smell of alcohol emanating from his body, with layers of wrinkles around the corners of his eyes and jaw, almost spelling out the word "pain" on his face.
0:10:29|0:10:37|[Geng Hao] took a few steps forward with the juice, while [Hao Yi] fumbled in his pocket for a moment and handed the phone to [Geng Hao].
0:10:57|0:11:11|In the phone recording, what Kang Xiaoyu said made Geng Hao feel a little upset and also a little heartbroken. He stared at Hao Yi for a long time, then walked towards the van parked halfway. Hao Yi played with the condom in his hand, looking at Geng Hao with a playful expression as he walked past.
0:11:29|0:11:44|The two then started the car and quickly drove towards the girls 3000 kilometers away. The wheels turned, and Dongdong stood in Geng Hao's arms, sticking his little head out of the window curiously looking around. As the vehicle sped along, the strong wind flapped the two ears of Dongdong.
0:11:46|0:12:0|[Hao Yi] had a U-shaped pillow around his neck, wearing a cowboy hat, one hand on the steering wheel, the other hand feeding himself dessert, looking very content. On the other hand, [Geng Hao] in the passenger seat had his arm resting on the car window, hand supporting his head, looking completely bored.
0:12:0|0:12:15|With the continuous flow of vehicles, five years ago, outside a hotel, Kang Xiaoyu was dressed in a palace bridesmaid outfit. She hurriedly ran from the taxi towards the lobby, pushed open the doors of the banquet hall, and rushed in.
0:12:42|0:12:46|Her slender body crashed through the door and fell in front of the guests.
0:14:36|0:14:44|The noisy applause was gradually replaced by the sound of water, as the water pipe in the solitary room's bathroom was gushing water, with [Kang Xiaoyu] wearing a shower cap.
0:15:4|0:15:15|[Kang Xiaoyu] was attracted by the lyrics, slowly raised her head, and looked at the screen brightly. It was a song called "Going to Dali" by [Geng Hao].
0:15:35|0:15:41|Tears rolled down her cheeks unconsciously, and [Kang Xiaoyu] wiped them away with a self-deprecating smile.
0:15:43|0:15:50|She put down the cup in her hand and typed on the computer, asking if this song can be downloaded. The online influencer replied with just one sentence, "It can only be streamed."
0:16:6|0:16:22|In the song, [Kang Xiaoyu] picked up the phone. The scene returned to the car driven by [Hao Yi]. The car TV was playing [Geng Hao]'s MV.
0:17:59|0:18:8|[Kang Xiaoyu] stood outside Dali City taking a photo with Zhu Bajie. After that, [Kang Xiaoyu] walked straight towards Dali, completely forgetting that she was still holding a rake in her hand.
0:18:10|0:18:23|She returned the items to the staff with a mixture of laughter and tears. Then she strolled along the bustling ancient town alley, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. [Kang Xiaoyu] let go of all worries and looked at everything in Dali with childlike innocence and joy.
0:18:24|0:18:36|Violently smiling at the singing friend, avoiding the kissing couple next to her, she walked to the city wall. After taking a photo, she left bouncing and jumping.
0:22:53|0:22:59|After all the effort put in by [Geng Hao] went to waste, [Hao Yi] felt it was a pity. Feeling a bit annoyed, he pursed his lips and stood up, saying to [Geng Hao].
0:23:48|0:23:56|Thinking that his seduction of [Hao Yi] had failed, [Geng Hao] had a big appetite and said to the barbecue boss.
0:24:7|0:24:15|The girl looked at [Hao Yi] with tears in her eyes, feeling that she had let her guard down. [Hao Yi] sat next to her with a bottle of wine in his hand.
0:24:49|0:25:1|After [Hao Yi] finished speaking, he stood up and the girl followed him towards the direction of the van, watching [Hao Yi] boast to himself while walking, [Geng Hao] felt deeply hurt. While [Hao Yi] was saying to be careful, his hand smoothly slid onto the girl's slender waist.
0:25:3|0:25:9|[Geng Hao] was very dissatisfied and wanted to prove himself. He looked around for a target, and finally his gaze fell on a female artist next to him who was eating skewers.
0:25:13|0:25:21|The female artist's prop tail was trapped under the chair, and [Geng Hao] decided to play the same trick again, so he walked towards her. Clumsily, he used his foot to hook the tail of the female artist.
0:26:28|0:26:35|The scene cuts back to [Kang Xiaoyu], who sits outside a beverage shop to take a break. She lowers her head and sees a thin and weak little dog whimpering.
0:26:35|0:26:50|She looked around, searching for the owner of the little dog. Then she lowered her head and asked, the dog was dirty, with a few strings of candied haws stuck to its body, looking like a stray dog. [Kang Xiaoyu] squatted down. Carefully lifted the little dog.
0:26:52|0:27:2|A mournful cry made Kang Xiaoyu feel distressed. So she took the puppy and arrived at the Wutong Inn.
0:27:24|0:27:32|After saying that, she happily ran up the stairs with her little dog, the sunlight sprinkling on her body, adding a touch of charm and vitality to her whole person.
0:27:39|0:27:46|Overlooking the Cangshan Mountains and Erhai Lake, [Kang Xiaoyu] couldn't help but exclaim, holding a small dog and spinning around excitedly.
0:28:22|0:28:25|[Hao Yi] took the card and quickly left.
0:28:52|0:29:6|Taking the perfume thrown by [Hao Yi], [Geng Hao] sprayed it randomly twice and walked across the street. It was a barber shop called Paris at Night, located in Furong Town, just as ancient as Furong Small Town. The weathered sign indicated its long history.
0:29:26|0:29:32|Upon hearing Geng Hao's response, a hint of pain and resentment appeared on the girl's face, her mouth slightly downturned as she sobbed softly.
0:29:42|0:29:49|Following the girl's gaze, [Geng Hao] noticed that two flies were circling around a dead goldfish on the table. He pointed at the goldfish and said.
0:30:7|0:30:13|[Geng Hao] was a bit puzzled to see the girl crying on the sofa.
0:30:22|0:30:30|[Geng Hao] sat somewhat awkwardly at the other end of the sofa, far away from the girl. Little did he know, the girl gestured for him to come closer and sit next to her.
0:30:31|0:30:39|[Geng Hao] had never seen such a posture before. He sniffed, lifted his butt, and moved over. The girl then took the opportunity to hug his arm, leaning on his shoulder and crying.
0:30:40|0:30:48|[Geng Hao] felt a bit uncomfortable and worried, so he rolled up his sleeves.
0:30:51|0:31:4|The girl suddenly became serious, as if she had never cried before, leaning on the sofa with her arms crossed. [Geng Hao] found it somewhat amusing.
0:31:6|0:31:16|The girl turned her head and stared at him for a while, then she put her feet down from the coffee table and stood up, glaring at [Geng Hao]. With a determined stride, she walked to the counter and pulled open a drawer.
0:33:28|0:33:36|The girl walked up to [Geng Hao] with some excitement, then she trotted upstairs to prepare the tools needed to pierce her ears.
0:34:18|0:34:38|The two saw a girl laughing lightly as she walked towards them in front of the barbershop. The girl shook her head and took out two props from her pocket, putting them on her ears. She playfully looked at [Hao Yi], widening her eyes and looking at the girl with a different charm after removing her makeup, which surprised [Hao Yi]. The girl stuck out her tongue.
0:34:39|0:34:45|The girl turned her head and raised her chin towards the electric bike behind her.
0:35:0|0:35:7|After saying that, [Hao Yi] left [Geng Hao] and took the girl across the street.
0:35:12|0:35:24|[Geng Hao] watched the two people on the opposite side of the road laughing and sticking together, feeling annoyed, he walked back to the barbershop. After getting his ear pierced, he followed the girl to the second floor room.
0:36:46|0:36:57|The girl was riding on [Geng Hao]. Just as she reached out her pinky finger to ask for a promise, the door rang, and the two quickly separated.
0:37:14|0:37:21|After saying there was no movement outside for the time being, [Geng Hao] threw the jeans to the girl in the room.
0:37:22|0:37:29|The girl who was still showing her legs put on jeans somewhat shyly. Just when they both thought it was safe, shouts could be heard from outside the door.
0:38:5|0:38:10|Li Maomao lit Geng Hao's shoes on fire.
0:38:15|0:38:21|After Geng Hao finished speaking, he became angry and stormed out, twisting the door open. The girl could only helplessly follow.
0:38:22|0:38:29|Li Maomao dropped the flaming shoe in his hand, picked up a nearby stick, and [Geng Hao] quickly extinguished the fire on the shoe.
0:40:21|0:40:33|Thinking of his own despicable behavior in front of Li Maomao, Geng Hao sat helplessly in the chair. Upon further thought, he realized he was even worse than Li Maomao, as he had even lit a cigarette for the mistress. The girl's uncle walked in with takeout and a chicken.
0:40:36|0:40:41|Uncle looked at the messy courtyard and asked, [Geng Hao] was too lazy and inconvenient to explain to him, so he casually replied.
0:40:42|0:40:57|The scene shifts, he drags a half-burned pair of worn-out shoes, carries clothes and sports a flashy earring, listlessly strolling past a group of square dancing aunties. With his mouth half open, he aimlessly wanders the streets, but looks up to see [Hao Yi]'s van parked not far away.
0:41:33|0:41:46|The scene shifts back to [Kang Xiaoyu], who is lying on the bed in the inn. She is scrutinizing the information of men on the marriage registration website with her laptop, searching for a somewhat acceptable candidate after a long time.
0:41:46|0:42:1|From the photo, the person is a young artistic musician, which suits her taste. After thinking for a while, [Kang Xiaoyu] took out her phone and dialed the man's number. The signal in the room seemed not very good, so she had to hold up her phone and run around the house in a mess.
0:42:26|0:42:41|The man's manner of speaking stunned [Kang Xiaoyu], who could only awkwardly pretend to be a tenant looking for a rental, and disappointedly hung up the phone. Glancing at the lively theme bar outside the window, she decided to go downstairs to relax. Casting away her bad mood from earlier, [Kang Xiaoyu] skipped down the stairs and onto the corridor bridge.
0:42:41|0:42:54|Contrary to the tranquility of the inn, the outside themed bar was bustling with excitement, where renowned tourists gathered in groups inside and outside the bar. [Kang Xiaoyu] walked around the courtyard of the bar, where numerous young men and women intertwined in every gap of the courtyard.
0:43:3|0:43:16|Others either turned a blind eye to the chaos or were influenced by the bewildering atmosphere. [Kang Xiaoyu] dodged the intoxicated men and women while wandering in the courtyard, when a man called out to her.
0:43:28|0:43:32|He then walked up to the bar and sat down, saying to the [Innkeeper].
0:43:34|0:43:41|The innkeeper gestured OK to the man outside the door and then pushed a cocktail in front of Kang Xiaoyu.
0:43:43|0:43:51|Kang Xiaoyu glanced at the man and pursed her lips, then turned to the Innkeeper and said.
0:44:8|0:44:15|The man outside the door moved a chair and sat across from [Kang Xiaoyu].
0:44:33|0:44:42|The man smirked and gave a thumbs-up to the [Innkeeper], while [Kang Xiaoyu] didn't want to get involved too much, picked up the glass and drank it all by herself.
0:44:57|0:45:4|Five years later, in the inn on the right bank, the sky was just getting light.
0:45:21|0:45:28|The two of them left the inn and returned to the car as they spoke.
0:46:23|0:46:42|The steering wheel lost control, in a moment of urgency, [Hao Yi] slammed on the brakes, and the vehicle swayed to a stop on the side of the road. The prop rifle with a bayonet in the back seat directly pierced into the multifunctional panel between the two. The strange stone also knocked open the trunk and fell in the middle of the road.
0:47:53|0:48:2|When the two were confronting each other and complaining, a small car drove straight into the strange rock in the middle of the road, lifting the chassis and scraping the ground all the way, then stopped abruptly at the roadside.
0:48:2|0:48:18|The argument between the two was interrupted by a sudden car accident. [Hao Yi] was holding a guandao, while [Geng Hao] was holding a couple's fan. They awkwardly walked towards the vehicle involved in the accident. A tall figure emerged from the car, catching the attention of the two from a distance.
0:48:26|0:48:31|The person getting off the car was dressed in a plain-colored small Western-style suit with a two-finger thick cowhide waist belt.
0:48:45|0:48:52|The woman used her personal anti-wolf spray to knock down [Hao Yi], then sprayed wildly at [Geng Hao]'s face.
0:48:53|0:49:11|The once quiet mountain road was now filled with the shouts of the two brothers echoing back and forth. After some time, the three of them cleared up the misunderstanding and began to check the condition of the car.
0:49:30|0:49:35|[Geng Hao], carrying luggage and holding a juice box, finally calmed down. He stood by the roadside for a while, then awkwardly walked back to the car.
0:49:49|0:49:53|[Hao Yi] hands the trailer rope to [Geng Hao] and continues to flirt with the woman.
0:50:44|0:50:57|The gradually closing car window trapped [Hao Yi]'s fingers, and he quickly withdrew his arm from the car body, standing awkwardly in place. The three of them, along with two cars, began to roam on the winding mountain roads. [Geng Hao] asked the woman.
0:51:28|0:51:34|[Geng Hao] took off the shiny earring and threw it out of the window.
0:51:54|0:52:4|The woman finished speaking, turned to the side and mocked before winking, [Zhou Lijuan] lightly smiled charmingly. Just as [Geng Hao] was suddenly moved, the phone suddenly vibrated, and he took out his phone to answer.
0:52:21|0:52:39|Hao Yi's attitude is truly excellent. After venting, he raised his phone, hugged a tree branch, and took a selfie with a big smile.
0:54:0|0:54:11|The vehicle slid closer to [Hao Yi], who was wearing headphones and couldn't hear the outside noise. [Geng Hao] was pulling the trailer rope.
0:54:15|0:54:26|Two cars collided and came to a stop by the stone bridge. [Hao Yi] leaned out of the car window, looking terrified.
0:54:31|0:54:49|As soon as the words fell, the van he was in staggered and slid towards the bridge, almost falling into the valley below. When the car stabilized a bit, [Hao Yi] used both hands and feet to climb out quickly.
0:54:56|0:55:4|The woman's concern made [Geng Hao] feel warmth for the first time in this twisty journey. He looked at the woman somewhat absent-mindedly.
0:55:10|0:55:17|Upon hearing Geng Hao's vague response, Hao Yi felt jealous and twisted his neck to ask.
0:57:8|0:57:16|She found the disc case and pulled it out from the bottom.
0:57:35|0:57:46|The innkeeper awkwardly put on his cap and said. Kang Xiaoyu walked out of the inn with a stack of DVDs, and the innkeeper struck up a conversation.
0:58:5|0:58:25|[Hao Yi] snatched the prop gun from the child's hand. This is a repair shop in the mountains where [Geng Hao] and the other two are taking a break.
0:58:38|0:58:44|As the woman held the egg in her hand and extended her arm to place it on Geng Hao's swollen eye, she gently massaged it.
0:58:46|0:59:3|The woman interrupted [Geng Hao], one hand holding his chin, the other lightly pressing a rolling egg on his face. The egg was warm, the jade hand cold, and [Geng Hao] closed his mouth in ecstasy. Seeing this scene, [Hao Yi] became anxious and quickly took out his phone to make a call.
1:0:8|1:0:15|[Hao Yi] stirs the instant noodles and asks [Geng Hao].
1:1:3|1:1:16|After some adjustments, the three men and a dog embarked on their journey again. The woman drove an electric tricycle, taking Geng Hao and Hao Yi through the rolling hills. The mountains were lush green, and the clouds in the sky moved like waves in the sea.
1:1:16|1:1:30|They roam freely on the rural roads of Dali, taking turns driving, transitioning from overcast skies to clear blue skies, from wandering in the mountains to the shores of Erhai Lake. Along the way, there are lush pear trees and the water and sky blend into one.
1:1:30|1:1:49|[Geng Hao] and the woman sat side by side on a tricycle, the wind beside them lifting the woman's hair, the sun shining brightly on her face, as if she exuded a magical and indescribable beauty. At this moment, [Geng Hao] seemed to have let go of his worries, holding up a juice box, enjoying the picturesque scenery around him.
1:1:49|1:2:7|The reflection of three people riding electric bikes on a small path by the lake slowly entered the water, with sunlight piercing through the clouds, casting a tangled light in the distance where water and sky meet. After a journey of ease and joy, the three finally arrived at the airport, where [Geng Hao] and [Hao Yi] stood outside the departure hall, looking at the woman across from them.
1:3:24|1:3:37|So [Geng Hao] put down the juice in his arms, put the anti-wolf spray back in his pocket, and then took out his phone, bowing his head to fiddle with the screen. There was no longer the previous relaxation and joy on his face, but instead a hint of seriousness and entanglement.
1:3:37|1:3:53|The phone screen displayed numerous missed calls from [Kang Xiaoyu], while [Geng Hao] still had "wife" as her contact name. He looked up, lost in thought for a while, and after a moment of struggle, he smiled gently and dialed the number.
1:4:54|1:4:57|On the phone, [Kang Xiaoyu] remained silent at this end.
1:6:12|1:6:24|Without waiting for [Kang Xiaoyu] to finish speaking, [Geng Hao] hung up the phone directly. He looked down at the screen of his phone, where the word "wife" was displayed, finally realizing that [Kang Xiaoyu] on the other end of the line no longer belonged to him.
1:6:24|1:6:41|The airport departure hall was elegantly decorated, but the dim lights shining on [Geng Hao] at this moment made him appear so lonely and fragile. He stared at his phone screen, wiping away tears from time to time, suppressing himself from crying out loud. [Hao Yi] came up from behind, carrying a dog crate, witnessing everything.
1:6:41|1:6:45|Watching [Geng Hao] and [Hao Yi] wiping away tears secretly, they felt uneasy in their hearts.
1:7:0|1:7:3|Upon seeing [Hao Yi], [Geng Hao] quickly adjusted his emotions, turned his back and wiped away his tears.
1:7:5|1:7:10|Facing the unavoidable [Hao Yi] who approached, [Geng Hao] forced himself to speak up.
1:7:26|1:7:31|The conversation between the two temporarily freed [Geng Hao] from pain and numbness, and he continued speaking.
1:8:11|1:8:23|In the lobby, [Hao Yi] helped [Geng Hao] clear the way and casually picked up a pot of green plants from the counter, stuffing it into his arms. The two walked out of the lobby and looked around for a while, spotting a woman and her friends chatting not far away.
1:8:24|1:8:35|Driven by a sense of failure and impulsiveness, [Geng Hao] hurriedly walked towards the woman with flowers in his hands. The words of love were on the tip of his tongue, but they were interrupted by a scene in front of them.
1:8:35|1:8:52|The woman locked her friend's arm in the corner, gently stroking her friend's cheek, while her friend's hand wandered around the woman's slender waist. Beside them, [Geng Hao] stood still holding a plant, unaware that the flowerpot in his hand had fallen to the ground.
1:8:54|1:9:0|Hao Yi's voice brought Geng Hao back to reality, he looked at the twitching face of the green plant and said fiercely.
1:10:19|1:10:25|He walked out of the bar, shaking his phone, and approached [Kang Xiaoyu].
1:10:32|1:10:38|The boss walked towards the middle of the courtyard while talking, and he walked to a table near the stage on his own.
1:10:48|1:10:55|[Kang Xiaoyu] was a bit annoyed, and the sound system occasionally blared with cries of passion and desire.
1:11:0|1:11:6|The atmosphere here made her feel disgusted and uncomfortable, so she walked straight to the stage and snatched the microphone from the host's hand.
1:11:49|1:12:6|With dizzying lights, deafening music, alcohol, and numerous attractive women, he numbs himself and dispels his frustrations. In the ambiguous and wild dance floor, those youthful and beautiful bodies are drenched in beer and champagne, crazily swaying to the rhythm of the music.
1:12:6|1:12:17|The loud music drowned out everyone's voices, as they drank and made merry, talking with their mouths open, like mute people unable to hear each other's words, and like strangers unable to see each other's inner preferences.
1:12:25|1:12:27|Drowning his suppressed past in alcohol, deceiving himself with the past, there is no more heartache at this moment.
1:12:29|1:12:37|The two are immersed in tonight's madness, reveling in the debauchery, and the scene shifts back to Kang Xiaoyu.
1:12:51|1:12:58|After listening to the words of the bar owner, [Kang Xiaoyu] chuckled in exasperation, no longer entangled, and directly picked up the phone placed on the table by the bar owner.
1:13:0|1:13:19|The bar owner squinted at [Kang Xiaoyu]. He didn't expect that [Kang Xiaoyu] would actually throw the phone into the Erhai Lake and run away. [Kang Xiaoyu] caught her breath and calmed down, watching the innkeeper searching for the phone without saying a word.
1:13:33|1:13:38|[Geng Hao] took out 200 yuan from his wallet and said to the hostess across the table.
1:13:43|1:13:51|The hostess taunted, lifting the bead curtain towards the bathroom, [Geng Hao] swayed as he sat up from the bed, extending his arm and sticking out his tongue.
1:13:54|1:14:1|[Geng Hao] sat down at the mahjong table, accompanying the hostess. Looking at the [Geng Hao] in front of her, she carefully asked him from the other side of the bead curtain as he sat on the bench by the bathtub.
1:15:10|1:15:23|Looking at the stack of coins on the table, the hostess smiled, lifted the bead curtain and walked up to [Geng Hao]. She gathered the money and organized the bills in her hand, then said, [Geng Hao] sat up straight and pointed at her with his finger.
1:15:33|1:15:41|[Geng Hao] grabbed nearly half of the bills on the table and said, while the hostess leaned on the table and adjusted for a long time, then spoke.
1:16:2|1:16:9|She pressed down on [Geng Hao]'s hand, picked up a beer and poured it into her mouth. The beer in the bottle kept decreasing, and soon it was empty.
1:16:10|1:16:17|[Geng Hao] doesn't buy it. He clenches the banknotes in front of him, stands up unsteadily, and says.
1:16:32|1:16:37|Watching [Geng Hao] drink the bath water in front of him, the hostess was stunned, almost dumbfounded.
1:17:1|1:17:8|Faced with Geng Hao's outburst, the hostess couldn't continue playing along, and Hao Yi stepped forward to stop the two from escalating the conflict.
1:17:20|1:17:26|He nervously opened the door, only to be stunned to find the Avatar girl standing at the doorway.
1:17:34|1:17:42|The girl remained silent, took out her phone from her pocket and showed him the screen with the social media updates of [Hao Yi].
1:18:14|1:18:26|The hostess covered her face and pushed open the door, the girl left the room, and the house suddenly fell silent. The atmosphere became somewhat awkward as the girl walked over to [Hao Yi], who was still lying on the ground.
1:18:41|1:18:55|The girl's hand gently swayed the jade Guanyin pendant that belonged to [Hao Yi].
1:18:59|1:19:13|[Hao Yi] looked at the pendant, as if a soft spot in his heart was touched by the girl. [Hao Yi] turned his head in a fluster to adjust his emotions, then resolutely spoke up.
1:20:9|1:20:15|He walked out unsteadily in a bathrobe.
1:20:32|1:20:44|Just as they were urging [Geng Hao] to return to the inn, a dozen motorcycles roared in and surrounded the two. A group of people got off the motorcycles, among whom were the two hostesses from earlier.
1:20:46|1:20:51|The two men referred to as "husbands" by the hostess sat on the motorcycle with a stern expression and a crew cut.
1:20:54|1:21:0|He stepped in to stop the flower-shirted henchman from beating up Geng Hao, with the air of a gang leader.
1:21:1|1:21:7|Took off his glasses, one of the hostess's eyebrows was raised on her eyelid, making her eyes look a bit smaller.
1:21:47|1:21:53|The younger brother stepped forward again, ready to make a move, and the hostess pulled out 200 yuan and said.
1:22:8|1:22:19|He patted the hostess to signal her to move aside. Then, draped in a suit, he walked up to [Geng Hao], sizing him up. Using the rearview mirror in his hand, he pushed open [Geng Hao]'s cufflink and saw the words "quit smoking." He asked.
1:22:36|1:22:44|The boss ordered [Geng Hao] to stand on the stone, while the henchman in the floral shirt hung around [Hao Yi]'s neck to control him.
1:23:14|1:23:24|[Geng Hao] started singing at the top of his lungs.
1:23:30|1:23:38|[Hao Yi]'s face twisted into a frown as he looked somewhat pitifully at [Geng Hao] beside him. The people gathered around them would occasionally burst into laughter.
1:23:50|1:24:4|Filled with sorrow and anger, [Hao Yi] stepped down from the rocks and accidentally pushed the boss. The henchmen were immediately displeased, with the one in the floral shirt leading the chase after [Hao Yi]. Meanwhile, [Geng Hao] on the rocks continued to howl aimlessly.
1:24:4|1:24:9|[Hao Yi] was pinned down in the corner by a group of people, and for a moment, the sound of singing, cursing, and screaming filled the air.
1:24:11|1:24:19|The sudden gunshot startled everyone, as [Hao Yi] in the corner stood up from the ground holding two guns.
1:26:42|1:26:48|After [Geng Hao] finished speaking, he burst into laughter like a madman, while [Hao Yi] panted heavily in front of him.
1:26:50|1:26:54|He shouted loudly, raised the muzzle, and fired several shots into the sky rapidly, breathing heavily.
1:26:55|1:27:8|Staring at [Geng Hao] for a long time, seeing that he still had that indifferent attitude, [Hao Yi] was so angry that he was shaking all over. After tidying up the scattered items on the ground, [Hao Yi] snatched the prop gun from [Geng Hao]'s hand and stuffed it into the bag, then left on his own.
1:27:13|1:27:20|The scene cuts to the police station, where [Kang Xiaoyu] compensates the money to the bar owner.
1:27:50|1:27:57|Listening to the police officer's lecture, [Kang Xiaoyu] felt extremely depressed.
1:28:0|1:28:6|The low and oppressive music starts playing, intertwining the experiences of [Geng Hao] and [Kang Xiaoyu].
1:28:9|1:28:23|The deserted street, [Geng Hao] woke up and deleted everything related to [Kang Xiaoyu] on his phone. Among the deleted items was a photo of him and [Hao Yi], and suddenly he saw the message wall in the photo album of the Wutong Inn. On the wall was a drawing of the words "Sorry, [Kang Xiaoyu]" by [Geng Hao].
1:28:45|1:28:50|Five years later, on another bleak night, [Geng Hao] was frantically trying to erase memories of his ex-wife.
1:28:51|1:29:10|In different time and space, two people are experiencing the same difficult night. The next morning, [Geng Hao] arrived outside Dali City and passed by the ancient city tower where his ex-wife had once seen. At the same time, [Kang Xiaoyu] walked down the stairs of the plane tree inn with her luggage, while [Geng Hao] glanced slightly outside the cafe where his ex-wife had rested.
1:29:10|1:29:16|The little dog with short legs ran wildly and caught up with [Kang Xiaoyu], who was about to leave the inn.
1:29:28|1:29:42|Time flies, and [Geng Hao] has returned to the place where love began 5 years ago. Standing at the inn's entrance, his mind wanders in memories. He stood still on the corridor for a while, then finally took a step into the [Wutong Inn].
1:29:43|1:29:48|The Wutong Inn is still the same as it was five years ago, just with more joyous tourists inside.
1:29:49|1:29:54|On the message wall, the drawings of [Geng Hao] and his ex-wife are enveloped in the joys and sorrows of all guests over the past 5 years.
1:29:55|1:30:7|[Geng Hao] stood across from the wall that carried the memories of countless people's youth. He tried hard to recall the original appearance of this wall, reminiscing about how it used to belong to him and his ex-wife.
1:30:14|1:30:26|Stopping outside the café where she found the puppy, she looked at the ground where the puppy had once laid, feeling deeply conflicted. She didn't want to leave the puppy in Dali, but she also didn't want to take away all the memories associated with Dali.
1:30:26|1:30:41|In the inn, [Geng Hao] used a dining knife to scrape his past on the message wall, but his mind was still on the first encounter with his ex-wife. Outside the cafe, [Kang Xiaoyu] rushed to the inn, unable to let go of the brief intimacy with the little dog.
1:30:54|1:31:17|The little dog actually sat obediently in his palm, surprisingly quiet and allowing the man to groom its fur. [Kang Xiaoyu] watched the man, slowly approached and sat down in front of him. The man turned out to be [Geng Hao], this was the memory of his first encounter with his ex-wife.
1:32:27|1:32:34|Seeing [Kang Xiaoyu] soaking orange peel in water to drink, [Geng Hao] threw the orange into the beer, took a sip, and made a face.
1:32:48|1:33:6|On the blank wall, [Geng Hao] left his name. On the other side of the same brick, [Kang Xiaoyu] also added her name. She looked at the discordant blank space between these two names and always felt that something was missing.
1:33:33|1:33:52|The two of them left the hall together, chatting along the way. Seasons came and went outside the inn, with five years passing in the blink of an eye, witnessing the changes of the four seasons. The decorations changed, and the message board outside the inn was constantly lit up, adding new messages one after another.
1:33:53|1:34:8|Five years have passed, the vicissitudes of time have stuck to [Geng Hao], making it difficult for him to break free from the shadows. The once spirited young singer has become the owner of a dilapidated audio equipment store, and now there is hardly a trace of his former self on [Geng Hao].
1:34:14|1:34:34|[Geng Hao] looked at the wall, at the small trace that belonged to him, tears once again filling his eyes. He turned around, picked up the knife on the table, and walked forward with his arms raised. The clumsy dance of the knife on the mottled wall, he wiped away his own name.
1:34:34|1:34:53|Erasing the name of the little dog, the name of [Kang Xiaoyu], erasing everything, their encounter and acquaintance, letting go of their mutual understanding and love. The wall is crumbling, tiny pieces floating in the air, landing heavily in his hands, memories dissipating like smoke. [Geng Hao] stops his movements, looking at the wall in front of him.
1:34:53|1:35:6|The bricks were left with scratches, just like the scar in his heart that was hard to heal. It seemed more appropriate to say that he was covering up memories rather than erasing the past. [Geng Hao] left the inn and passed by the bar.
1:36:32|1:36:39|The clever gaze and questioning of the [Innkeeper] made [Geng Hao] feel uncomfortable all over, and he awkwardly nodded and said.
1:36:44|1:36:48|So the [Innkeeper] immediately put on a smile and handed the pipe in his hand to [Geng Hao], asking him.
1:37:0|1:37:15|Amidst the mocking laughter of the crowd in the bar, [Geng Hao] waved his hand and walked out. It was a sunny day, just like the day he left Beijing, with the sunlight intense and the shadow heavy dragging on the ground. As he walked, [Geng Hao] lowered his head to look at the shadow beneath him.
1:37:15|1:37:21|Walking along, he suddenly stopped, shifted his body, and looked at the shadow moving on the ground, softly asking himself.
1:37:24|1:37:35|The sun was shining brightly, [Geng Hao] stood in the middle of the path, with the shadow of the eaves outside, his shadow beneath his feet. He raised his head slightly to meet the wind blowing from the opposite direction, recalling [Hao Yi]'s words about shadows.
1:37:57|1:38:3|Back at the bar, [Geng Hao] looked at the promotional video still playing and asked.
1:38:47|1:38:53|The bar owner scolded the agreeing colleague.
1:39:15|1:39:32|[Geng Hao] sprayed the anti-wolf spray wildly in the bar, causing chaos. The innkeeper and the staff endured the burning sensation in their eyes as they chased after [Geng Hao]. While pushing and shoving, [Geng Hao] threw the disc box cushions to block them, and ran towards the outside of the bar.
1:39:32|1:39:38|The crowd, in a state of desperation, disregarded the clutter in the bar and picked up whatever was at hand to throw at [Geng Hao].
1:39:40|1:39:56|The colorful curtains in the bar were torn down and draped over everyone, the balloons on the ceiling lamp by the window were also brought down by the falling gauze, fluttering around the crowd. They chased [Geng Hao] all the way to the bar entrance, where a waiter threw a drumstick and knocked [Geng Hao] to the ground.
1:39:57|1:40:15|The bar owner and the remaining staff swarmed around [Geng Hao], beating him up with punches and kicks. Before long, [Geng Hao] was left bruised and swollen, grimacing on the ground. Despite being continuously attacked, there was no trace of regret or unwillingness on his face.
1:40:15|1:40:35|From the joy that can be seen between his arms desperately protecting his head, he finally let go of the past. The pain on his body was nothing compared to the hardships he had endured internally during this time. Watching the juice and [Hao Yi] running towards him in the distance, the joy on [Geng Hao]'s face became even more apparent.
1:40:35|1:40:45|He opened his mouth wide, waving his arms frantically towards a person and a dog in the distance. However, at that moment, the innkeeper squinted his swollen eyes and raised a bottle of alcohol.
1:40:48|1:40:53|After the heavy blow, the scene was filled with intense gasps and hurried footsteps.
1:40:54|1:41:0|[Hao Yi] walked briskly down the alley towards the hospital, carrying juice and supporting the already paralyzed [Geng Hao].
1:42:3|1:42:22|[Geng Hao] caressed [Hao Yi]'s leg and looked up at him, saying. Hao Yi turned his head away, unable to bear looking at the bloodied [Geng Hao] in his arms. The two collapsed in front of an old lady sunbathing.
1:42:24|1:42:36|Hao Yi looked at Geng Hao, who was pouting on his leg, hinting for him to kiss. The dying look on Geng Hao made him feel sad and guilty. Hao Yi looked up and saw an old lady on the roadside nodding as if understanding something.
1:42:39|1:43:4|After some hesitation, Hao Yi reluctantly closed his eyes and puckered his lips, leaning towards [Geng Hao] for a kiss. Puckering his lips, he slowly lowered his head. Suddenly, [Geng Hao] pulled out his phone and aimed it at Hao Yi's pouting face, causing Hao Yi to open his eyes wide. With a big laugh, [Geng Hao] sprang up from his arms.
1:43:56|1:44:1|Amidst the applause, [Geng Hao] stepped onto the stage, where Hao Yi and the Avatar girl Dongdong were having their wedding.
1:44:24|1:44:29|On the lush green lawn, numerous balloons representing blessings are released into the air.
1:44:51|1:45:0|Saying that [Kang Xiaoyu] was about to leave, [Geng Hao] picked up her handbag left on the sofa and said, the two walked side by side in the corridor, [Kang Xiaoyu] broke the awkward silence and asked.
1:45:16|1:45:23|[Geng Hao] looked at [Kang Xiaoyu], only to realize that the woman he had been obsessed with was not of the same class as himself.
1:45:26|1:45:44|He watched [Kang Xiaoyu] get into the car and leave the hotel. Their simple farewell signified that [Geng Hao] had completely let go of the past. Dressed in a suit, he looked sharp and spirited, smiling as he turned back towards the hotel, only to come face to face with the bridesmaid [Xiao Bei] carrying bags of knives and clothes out of the lobby.
1:46:6|1:46:15|The two of them carefully chatted as they carried props and walked towards the parking lot.
1:46:22|1:46:33|[Xiao Bei] looks like a quiet and gentle girl, not very good with words. The two accidentally made eye contact, then quickly looked away, both feeling a bit awkward. Under the shade of trees by the roadside.
1:47:13|1:47:21|In the shade of the trees, as the two were chatting, [Hao Yi] and [Dongdong] in the wedding car were reminiscing about the past, reliving the passion.
