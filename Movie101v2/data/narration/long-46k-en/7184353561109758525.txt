0:1:35|0:1:53|[Jennifer] drove on the elevated highway, lifting her right hand occasionally to take a few puffs of cigarette. She stopped at a street stall, eating peanut cakes with her head down, with a bowl of noodles on the table. Suddenly, she looked up, tears already streaming down her face. The owner of the record store greeted her as soon as he saw her.
0:1:54|0:1:59|[Jennifer] approached the stall with a cigarette in hand, casually flipping through the items, as the shopkeeper added.
0:2:15|0:2:22|[Jennifer] listened quietly with her eyes downcast, picked up a cigarette and brought it to her lips, then blew out a puff of smoke.
0:2:24|0:2:42|Smoke billows out as the scene unfolds, her fluffy waves cascading down her shoulders. The screen darkens gradually, and the title emerges from left to right: "Break Up, Stay Together". In the bright bathroom stall, [Zhuo Xiaolin] sits on the toilet seat, looking absent-minded.
0:2:47|0:3:13|[Kouzi] looked at the apple phone in his hand, the screen showed that the caller was Tianyan. His fingers were painted with unique nail polish, anxiously touching the side of the phone. After a few seconds, the screen relaxed and he closed his eyes. [Kouzi] took a deep breath, simply turned off the screen, and buried his head to continue worrying and pulling his hair.
0:3:34|0:3:37|The group led by [Zhuo Xiaolin] wore sunglasses and got on the nanny car.
0:4:1|0:4:12|Under the second gate of the terminal building, [Zhuo Xiaolin] walked out alone with sunglasses on and hands in his pockets, taking quick steps. As night fell, he got out of the taxi, silently reciting in his heart.
0:4:41|0:4:58|[Kouzi] stood by the fountain pool in the residential area. Suddenly, water started spraying from the pool, and [Kouzi] laughed with joy. He gazed at the fountain and relaxed, his long hair covering his right ear. On the other side of the stall, [Young Shopkeeper] was typing on a laptop.
0:5:10|0:5:23|He typed the last period of the article, steam wafting around him, [Zhuo Xiaolin] with thick eyebrows and big eyes, wearing a high-necked cardigan. This is an old stall selling beef noodle soup, [Zhuo Xiaolin] stretched his muscles and shouted.
0:6:3|0:6:15|[Engineer] frowned when he heard the news, while [Button] fell asleep on a bench in the community. [Engineer] walked slowly towards her and took off the bag from his shoulder. He looked at [Button] with a slight surprise.
0:6:22|0:6:25|Hamlet once wrote love letters to her.
0:6:38|0:6:57|In a blink of an eye, [Zhuo Xiaolin] was already standing in front of the bathroom mirror, using a towel to dry his half-wet hair. A photo of him smiling with Ye Ruhua hung on the wall. Wrapped in a bath towel, he lay on the bed as the man used a hairdryer to blow-dry his hair. With his eyes closed, [Zhuo Xiaolin] lay on the man's thigh as the man gently stroked the stray hairs on his forehead.
0:6:57|0:7:5|The man drove out with [Zhuo Xiaolin], who sat in the passenger seat looking out at the street view. They arrived at a bar called Tide.
0:7:13|0:7:28|The long-haired girl in a checkered shirt sings softly on the stage. In front of the eight tables, the man stares at [Zhuo Xiaolin] and takes a sip of his drink, then turns around and leans against the eighth table, setting down his glass. [Zhuo Xiaolin] sits next to him, supporting her forehead and looking towards the stage, memories flooding back.
0:7:44|0:7:59|[Kouzi] stood on the original stage of the bar singing, with cheers and applause from the audience below, creating a lively atmosphere. Tianye sat in the corner, watching [Kouzi] on stage with interest. As the song ended, [Kouzi] threw a kiss to the audience below, smiling and hugging the guitarist beside her.
0:8:0|0:8:15|After the bar closed, the band members embraced [Zhuo Xiaolin] and walked out of the bar. After waving goodbye to them, [Zhuo Xiaolin] crossed the street and a man on a motorcycle carried him home. [Zhuo Xiaolin] sat behind him, holding onto his waist tightly.
0:8:15|0:8:26|In the bedroom hung the familiar crystal bead curtain, [Zhuo Xiaolin] leaned against the door frame, smiling and playing with the curtain. The man walked over, gently brushed the bead curtain, approached [Zhuo Xiaolin] with a smile, and gazed into his eyes.
0:8:27|0:8:47|The man lifted the chin of [Button] with his index finger, and [Button] smiled sweetly, showing their intimacy. The man is [Zhuo Xiaolin], [Button]'s boyfriend. In the neon-lit city under the night sky, [Duoduo] returned to the new house with her boyfriend. As soon as she entered, she hurried to help her boyfriend push the luggage into the room.
0:8:56|0:9:17|[Duoduo] changed into slippers, her boyfriend collapsed on the bed. With a smile on her face, [Duoduo] squatted down to help him take off his shoes and neatly put them away. Her boyfriend relaxed and looked up at the ceiling, then as [Duoduo] climbed on top of him, he hugged her and kissed her. [Duoduo] eagerly leaned down to kiss his lips.
0:9:17|0:9:22|After a while, [Duoduo] re-made the bed, arranged the pillows, and spread out the blanket.
0:9:29|0:9:44|He tucked his messy hair behind his ears, picked up a cloth, and started wiping the floor. As the boyfriend came out of the bathroom, he left a trail of wet footprints on the clean wooden floor. [Duoduo] paused for a moment, then half-knelt and carefully wiped away the footprints.
0:9:44|0:9:50|In the morning, [Duoduo] examined the lace camisole in her hand, then suddenly leaned on her boyfriend's chest and asked.
0:10:2|0:10:5|[Duoduo] looked up at the sky and sighed helplessly.
0:10:30|0:10:42|She pouted and lay down, her boyfriend hugged her and put one leg over her. [Duoduo] rested on her boyfriend's arm, thinking, then suddenly spoke.
0:11:25|0:12:1|[Duoduo] walked up to the phone, looking somewhat surprised. She blinked her eyes and listened quietly. As night fell, there were many customers in front of the peanut cake shop. [Young Shopkeeper] stood beside her sister [Duoduo], helping with the business. After closing the stall, [Duoduo] and [Young Shopkeeper], [Duoduo] and [Zhuo Xiaolin] sat around a table on the roadside stall.
0:12:7|0:12:16|[Zhuo Xiaolin] ate noodles with a bowl in her hands, feeling a bit awkward after sensing her sister's gaze. [Duoduo] looked at her silently, while the two men observed the two sisters.
0:12:23|0:12:39|Amidst the thick steam, [Duoduo] wiped away tears. When she was young, [Duoduo] and [Button] used to sit by the roadside stall like this, eating together. [Duoduo] blew on the tangyuan in her bowl to cool it down before feeding it to [Button], who had a small braid and was laughing so much that her eyes disappeared.
0:12:39|0:12:47|Memories faded, [Zhuo Xiaolin] put down the bowl, holding [Duoduo]'s hand tightly. After finishing the meal, the four of them stood chatting.
0:13:2|0:13:9|[Young Shopkeeper] pulls [Duoduo] away, while [Duoduo] carries a bag of pastries. Back at home, [Zhuo Xiaolin] acts with [Duoduo].
0:13:23|0:13:29|[Zhuo Xiaolin] pushed aside the pearl curtain and walked up to [Duoduo].
0:13:58|0:14:0|He knelt down and looked at [Duoduo] sitting on the edge of the bed.
0:14:12|0:14:19|[Zhuo Xiaolin] lies down on the bed. Her pants are lying next to her.
0:14:47|0:14:51|There is a junior apprentice playing Ophelia.
0:15:21|0:15:32|[Kouzi] closed his eyes, shook his head and fell silent, as if entering a dreamland. [Zhuo Xiaolin] turned his head, lying on his back, his thoughts drifting far away. The two embraced each other and fell asleep peacefully.
0:15:46|0:16:5|[Kouzi] snuggled into Xiaoling's arms in his sleep, his long legs resting on hers, with the sunlight shining on the soles of their feet, still in a beautiful dream. With the warm sun shining high, a band with unique makeup performed on the square's steps, while a young photographer eagerly took pictures of them.
0:16:5|0:16:12|Suddenly, his camera captured [Jennifer] smoking, taking several shots in a row. In the footage, [Jennifer] looked confident and elegant.
0:16:14|0:16:32|The wind blew over her cigarette-clasping fingertips and through her hair, causing the photographer to be distracted. [Jennifer] stood with one hand crossed over her chest, the other hand holding a cigarette, leaning against the glass partition outside the mall. The photographer walked up to her, hands in pockets, with a lollipop in his mouth.
0:16:37|0:16:41|Jennifer didn't respond, she just took out a cigarette from the cigarette case and handed it to him.
0:16:42|0:17:2|The photographer took the cigarette from his mouth, patted his pocket with his left hand, and then helplessly took the cigarette out to ask. [Jennifer] blinked her eyes in silence and handed him the lighter. The photographer raised the hand holding the sugar to shield the lighter, pressed it several times before lighting the cigarette. After carefully looking at the lighter, he handed it back.
0:17:4|0:17:13|[Jennifer] took the lighter, kept her original posture looking at the street view, the photographer exhaled a puff of smoke, put the lollipop back in her mouth, and couldn't help but speak.
0:17:15|0:17:19|[Jennifer] smiled lightly, without saying a word. Finally, [Jennifer] turned to look at him, scanned him up and down, and asked non-stop.
0:17:37|0:17:53|When the photographer left, [Jennifer] was already eating the same lollipop, and the two bid farewell easily. The photographer [Da Miao] was still biting on the lollipop.
0:18:29|0:18:41|[Jennifer] and [Zhuo Xiaolin] organized a drinking session together. [Jennifer] was a bit tipsy and chatting animatedly, while [Zhuo Xiaolin] sitting across from her was just focused on watching her, occasionally squinting and laughing heartily.
0:18:41|0:18:58|[Duoduo]'s partner held a bottle of liquor and poured a glass for [Jennifer], who drank it down happily, taking two or three glasses in a row. [Duoduo] watched her finish and then raised his head to drink a cup of white wine. In the early morning, sunlight shone through the cracks in the curtains and stood on the bed. [Jennifer] lay on her side, groggily reaching out to touch the silk sheets.
0:18:59|0:19:9|After a moment, she opened her eyes, still wearing the bright skirt from yesterday, barefoot on the illuminated wooden floor, and walked to the window to pull back the curtains.
0:19:48|0:19:57|Zhan Jie smiled and gestured to open the express delivery seal. She took out an ID card from the paper bag, memories of last night flooding into her mind.
0:20:14|0:20:22|[Jennifer] in a hurry, accidentally knocks her ID card away, [Zhuo Xiaolin] takes the opportunity to get close to her lips, memories abruptly stop, [Jennifer] picks up her phone.
0:20:30|0:20:40|[Jennifer] paced back and forth in front of the French windows, with a smile playing on her lips and in her eyes. Inside the luxurious decorated Western restaurant, [Zhuo Xiaolin] squatted in front of the dining table, staring at the salad, and asked.
0:22:7|0:22:20|After drinking, the two interlocked their fingers at the dining table and embraced each other in a slow dance. [Jennifer] placed her hand on [Zhuo Xiaolin]'s neck, bringing them closer together. [Zhuo Xiaolin] cupped [Jennifer]'s face and gently kissed her lips.
0:22:20|0:22:28|[Jennifer] hugged him tightly, seeming eager to encourage, tilting her head back to enjoy the gradually intensifying affection, the crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling becoming blurred.
0:22:29|0:22:55|The two held hands and arrived at the street night market. [Jennifer] picked up a piece of unfinished peanut cake from the stall and stuffed it into her mouth. The [Young Shopkeeper], seeing a regular customer, immediately invited the two to sit down. Following [Jennifer]'s gaze, [Zhuo Xiaolin] saw an elderly couple sitting at a table feeding each other.
0:22:59|0:23:8|In the bridal shop, [Duoduo] sat in front of the dressing table, smiling brightly. She stood in front of her boyfriend in a wedding dress adorned with diamonds, with [Zhuo Xiaolin] helping him hold the train.
0:23:9|0:23:24|[Duoduo] was held in the arms by her boyfriend, tilting her head back to share a sweet kiss with him. Beside her, [Zhuo Xiaolin] watched her sister's mischievous state with a smile. On the opposite side, [Young Shopkeeper] had a completely different attitude, leaning against the mirror with his head down, unwilling to look at the two of them.
0:23:24|0:23:38|[Duoduo] laughed unaffectedly, covering her mouth, immersed in the happiness of her new marriage. [Young Shopkeeper] also smiled broadly at her joy, brushing off the English from earlier. The couple interviewed at the marriage registration office.
0:23:47|0:23:53|The two smiled at each other and leaned in together to take wedding photos.
0:24:46|0:25:1|The groom impatiently handed the tray of wedding candies to [Duoduo] and walked away. [Duoduo] watched his retreating figure, puzzled. The young shopkeeper was browsing Weibo on a tablet at the stall, and when he saw [Duoduo] returning in his toasting outfit, he questioned him.
0:25:25|0:25:40|[Duoduo] silently put away the candy, [Young Shopkeeper] turned to look at him, sensing something was wrong. He walked over to Duoduo, bent down, carefully observing his expression, then put on a harmless smile.
0:25:53|0:25:55|Duoduo's lips curled into a smile.
0:26:23|0:26:47|[Young Shopkeeper] snatched a bag of candies from [Duoduo] and tore open the packaging with his mouth. He stuffed the candy into his mouth, making satisfied humming sounds as he chewed. [Young Shopkeeper] leaned on the table, watching [Duoduo]. [Duoduo] lowered his head and chuckled. The two of them sat on the roadside stall, eating skewers.
0:26:56|0:26:59|The young shopkeeper sat up straight and said.
0:27:30|0:27:36|Zhuo Xiaolin and Duoduo walked side by side on the night market street.
0:28:14|0:28:23|[Young Shopkeeper] caught up and grabbed [Duoduo]'s wrist. [Duoduo] shook off his hand and crossed his arms, looking at him.
0:28:36|0:28:39|[Duoduo] bit her lip and stood slantingly without saying a word.
0:28:45|0:28:48|[Young Shopkeeper] waved his hand.
0:29:13|0:29:30|[Duoduo] pointed at Young Shopkeeper's nose, but then calmed down. A slap landed squarely on Young Shopkeeper's face. [Duoduo] looked at the palm of his hand, then turned his head to see Li Gongnan. He watched the two of them as if watching a play, a sly smile playing at the corner of his mouth.
0:31:10|0:31:29|In the room, [Duoduo] sat in front of the dressing table spraying perfume. He carefully dabbed the fragrance on his wrist and then behind his ear, smoothed his hair in front of the mirror, and revealed a charming smile. Meanwhile, [Young Shopkeeper] sat in a dimly lit bar, picked up a bottle of beer, took a few big gulps, and then slowly shook his head with his head down.
0:31:35|0:32:3|The bar was empty, with only [Young Shopkeeper] and the rustic wooden tables and chairs. In the bedroom of the bridal chamber, [Duoduo] with a smile on her face climbed onto the bed first, leaned close to [Engineer], only to find him already fast asleep. [Duoduo] nudged [Engineer] but got no response.
0:32:9|0:32:25|[Duoduo] took a deep breath and turned around, helplessly grabbing his hair a few times. He looked at [Zhuo Xiaolin] with unwillingness. [Zhuo Xiaolin] was sound asleep, lying on his side with his back facing [Duoduo], not making a sound.
0:32:25|0:32:34|[Duoduo] pushed him away disdainfully, pulled the blanket over more than half of it, lay down for a few seconds, and then pushed [the Engineer] again, expressing her dissatisfaction.
0:32:43|0:32:57|The moon hung high in the sky, and the neon lights reflected dazzling light. [Jennifer] woke up from a nightmare, tears streaming down her cheeks. She set up a tent in the middle of the living room, sitting inside cuddling a rag doll and muttering to herself.
0:33:9|0:33:23|[Jennifer] cuddles a doll, but her mind drifts to a boy. In the studio, [Zhuo Xiaolin] is eating a lollipop. She picks up her phone, opens WeChat, looks at the screen, and raises an eyebrow.
0:33:40|0:34:0|Junmo still had a look of almost crying. [Zhuo Xiaolin] thought for a moment, scooped the lollipop in his mouth between his front teeth. He packed two portions of braised noodles and placed them on the dining table, then turned to the kitchen to fetch two plates. [Jennifer] sat at the table, watching him intently.
0:34:0|0:34:17|[Zhuo Xiaolin] handed the chopsticks to [Jennifer], then sat down and helped her open the lid of the box. Just as he lifted the chopsticks, he awkwardly said. [Jennifer] smiled and picked up a wide noodle to feed into her mouth, as [Zhuo Xiaolin] looked at her and asked.
0:34:26|0:34:42|[Zhuo Xiaolin] watched as [Jennifer] ate the noodles earnestly, and she found herself feeling hungry too. She ate the noodles heartily, unable to hide the smile on her face. Inside [Jennifer]'s tent, a pair of dolls cuddled under the soft light, creating a warm and beautiful scene. The next morning, [Zhuo Xiaolin] was busy in the kitchen.
0:34:44|0:35:1|The lilies by the window obscured her figure, [Jennifer] quietly approached [Zhuo Xiaolin], and embraced her waist from behind, closing her eyes and gently leaning against her back. [Zhuo Xiaolin] set down the milk carton in her hand, grabbed [Jennifer]'s hand, and turned around, gazing into her deep eyes.
0:35:1|0:35:10|[Zhuo Xiaolin] pins [Jennifer] down on the bed, steadies her lips with his hand, deftly removes her T-shirt, and plants hot kisses on [Jennifer]'s neck.
0:35:26|0:35:35|[Jennifer] jumped into the pool, wearing a dress like a lily, and swam towards [Zhuo Xiaolin]. They romantically kissed underwater, in this moment, they only had each other.
0:35:39|0:35:54|In front of the ancient painted screen, the elegantly dressed old performer lightly waved the paper fan while singing softly. A glamorous lady in the audience blew on her teacup, with [Jennifer] sitting next to her on a stone-glued chair, attentively enjoying Kunqu opera.
0:35:54|0:36:2|The spacious hall was filled with nearly ten dining tables, but there were only two guests, [Jennifer] and her wife, sitting at the central VIP table, clearly having reserved the whole place.
0:36:5|0:36:13|Madam put down the tea in her hand and turned her gaze to [Jennifer]. [Jennifer] seemed to sense something and silently averted her eyes.
0:36:37|0:36:43|Jennifer stopped herself just as the words were about to come out of her mouth, and Zhuo Xiaolin's mother turned to look at her, persuading her.
0:37:9|0:37:15|[Ma Dongmei] watched [Jennifer] unmoved, leaning back on the chair and said leisurely.
0:37:36|0:37:43|[Jennifer] pursed her lips, quickly packed up her purse and coat, stood up, smiled politely, and then turned around to leave the teahouse with large strides.
0:37:45|0:38:3|In the night market, [Jennifer] sat alone at a roadside stall, steam rising from the bowl in front of her, enveloping her face. Her sunglasses shielded her tears, but her heaving shoulders betrayed her emotions. The moonlight illuminated the rooftop as [Jennifer], dressed in a knitted robe, sat on the outdoor beam.
0:38:3|0:38:6|She swayed the red wine glass in her hand, tears streaming down uncontrollably.
0:38:22|0:38:40|She arrived at the small noodle stall she often visited, and Zhuo Xiaolin's eyes lit up with joy. She smiled, turned around immediately, and walked back home. On the dining table at home, there were scented candles burning, and Duoduo served up tall glass cups and braised noodles.
0:38:44|0:38:52|[Jennifer] opened the door and saw [Zhuo Xiaolin], she walked in quietly, stood at the entrance rubbing her hands nervously.
0:38:54|0:39:13|What are you standing there for? The flickering candlelight reflects on [Jennifer]'s face, showing her gentle and serene expression. She habitually tucks her long hair behind her ear and looks up at [Zhuo Xiaolin] sitting at the table. [Zhuo Xiaolin] places a tall glass in front of her and then walks to the other side to pour red wine for her.
0:39:13|0:39:25|[Jennifer] lowered her head, a faint smile on her face, while [Zhuo Xiaolin] looked at her sincerely, tightly holding her hands. Soon, [Zhuo Xiaolin] carried in a large cake from the door, followed by her studio partners.
0:39:26|0:39:34|The partners were blessed with flowers by everyone, and they embraced and kissed amidst the laughter of the crowd.
0:40:5|0:40:9|[Zhuo Xiaolin] and [Jennifer] cuddle on the rooftop, surrounded by flickering candlelight.
0:40:39|0:40:55|Tian, impatiently, supported the goose and sighed, then left the recording studio and returned to the living room, sitting on the sofa and sulking with his knees pressed together. The slender agent followed him and, seeing his appearance, slowed down and sat down beside him helplessly.
0:41:30|0:41:45|[Zhuo Xiaolin] looked silently at the agent. He walked slowly back to the bedroom, where he seemed to see [Duoduo] lying on the bed reading. [Duoduo] held a piece of toast, took a bite, flipped through the pages of the book, and casually swung her feet in the air.
0:41:45|0:41:56|He was looking at a photo album, mostly filled with live concert pictures. [Zhuo Xiaolin] tugged at the quilt and looked straight at the bed. Sitting on the edge of the bed, he recalled the scene when he first met [Duoduo].
0:42:42|0:43:3|Aoyama, who was eating in the store, looked at Zhuo Xiaolin with interest. Linzi, sitting next to Aoyama, also looked towards Zhuo Xiaolin, listening attentively.
0:43:31|0:43:56|The young shopkeeper handed a pen to Tianye. Tianye placed the paper on the gift box of peanut cakes and quickly wrote a line. Tianye stared intently at Zhuo Xiaolin. He handed the paper over, and Zhuo Xiaolin hesitated for a moment before accepting it. The young shopkeeper smiled and saw the guest off. In the bar, Tianye sang passionately.
0:44:28|0:44:47|That night, [Zhuo Xiaolin] and Tianye sat in a corner of the bar talking. As a song ended, time passed, and Tianye was interviewed at home by the media.
0:45:25|0:45:37|The female host handed the microphone to Tianye, but received a long silence in return. Meanwhile, Zhuo Xiaolin was at home focusing on typing, while Duoduo lay on the bed, legs crossed, looking at a tablet.
0:45:53|0:46:13|Kouzi looked at the screen of Tianye and started to have a headache again. He wearily supported his forehead and closed his eyes. After a while, he sat next to the fountain in the community humming a song. Tianye drove and stopped in front of [Zhuo Xiaolin], who stood up and looked at him.
0:46:44|0:46:51|Tian gently caressed Zhuo Xiaolin's embroidered hair, holding it tightly on her shoulders. On the dazzling and dreamy stage, Zhuo Xiaolin sang with deep emotion.
0:47:5|0:47:7|Tianye walked onto the stage and called for the accompaniment to stop.
0:47:37|0:47:47|[Zhuo Xiaolin] came to the scene to watch the rehearsal of [Duoduo], sitting down in a spot by herself. Tian also sat down shortly after, leaving a seat between them. [Duoduo] closed her eyes on stage, feeling the music.
0:47:48|0:47:53|[Zhuo Xiaolin] below the stage lowered her eyes and opened her mouth to speak to Tianye.
0:48:37|0:48:40|In the bedroom of the wedding case, [Duoduo] helps [the Engineer] with the laundry.
0:48:59|0:49:3|[Zhuo Xiaolin] sat on the edge of the bed, leaning back with a dissatisfied expression.
0:49:17|0:49:31|[Duoduo] threw the clothes to [Zhuo Xiaolin], lay on the bed angrily, lifted her foot and pressed the clothes under her legs. [Zhuo Xiaolin] impatiently took off his own clothes, [Duoduo] turned her head, glared at him hatefully, and suddenly sat up on the bed.
0:49:57|0:50:3|[Duoduo] threw the clothes onto [the Engineer], and watched as he sat down and kicked it away.
0:50:31|0:50:40|Li Gongnan held Duoduo's ankle, with no hint of tenderness in his eyes. Duoduo stubbornly glared at him, but he turned his head away, refusing to speak.
0:51:7|0:51:13|[Duoduo] looked at the customer with red eyes, she pursed her lips and directly took out the business license, walking up to the customer.
0:51:59|0:52:8|The female customer took the pastries and left, leaving [Duoduo] fuming. She knocked over the paper cover on the stall, and [Young Shopkeeper] wanted to advise her but hesitated.
0:52:12|0:52:33|[Duoduo] turned around, leaning against the stall, while the onlookers continued to watch with undiminished interest. [Young Shopkeeper] sighed and shouted to disperse the crowd. The man who was watching the excitement stood still and smoked, unmoved, then slowly walked away when he saw nothing was happening here.
0:52:33|0:52:50|[Duoduo] hugged her arms and lowered her head, suddenly her face wrinkled, and she started crying silently. The bright red hairband on her hairline became particularly eye-catching. [Duoduo] had always been called "Peanut Butter Beauty" by the small vendors, so when she set up her stall, she naturally dressed up like this.
0:52:50|0:53:8|[Duoduo] shrugged her shoulders, crying heavily and gasping for breath. She hugged herself helplessly like a young girl, rubbing her shoulders back and forth. The young shopkeeper walked up to her, raised his hand in the air for a moment, then gently comforted [Duoduo] by keeping his hand on her shoulder.
0:53:10|0:53:25|[Duoduo] turned his head to look elsewhere, but couldn't suppress the sadness, burying his head in his arms and sobbing. [Young Shopkeeper] set down what he was holding and silently stood by his side. After a while, [Duoduo] lifted his head, and seeing that he was feeling a bit better, [Young Shopkeeper] leaned against him shoulder to shoulder.
0:53:25|0:53:30|[Duoduo] blinked hard, holding back the tears, gradually calming down.
0:53:35|0:53:47|[Young Shopkeeper] quietly looked at [Duoduo], who furrowed her brows. [Duoduo] lowered her head, once again hiding the tears welling up. Young Shopkeeper's eyes also welled up with tears as he turned away.
0:54:9|0:54:35|The young shopkeeper glanced at him, lowered his eyes in silence. [Duoduo] rubbed his nose and covered his mouth. The young shopkeeper tilted his head to one side and let out a sigh. Amidst the bustling crowd behind, [Duoduo] looked at him choking back tears. He supported his face, furrowing his brows.
0:54:54|0:55:7|The young shopkeeper turned around, stroked Duoduo's head, and then comforted her by patting her shoulder. Duoduo's fingers pointed accurately at her chin.
0:55:9|0:55:36|Her mouth twitched as if crying or smiling, her hand trembling as it touched her neck. Finally, unable to hold back, she leaned on the arm of the Young Shopkeeper and burst into tears. The Young Shopkeeper wrapped his arm around her, looking expressionless. Jennifer took Duoduo and her friend Lucy out for a meal.
0:57:21|0:57:26|[Jennifer] lights a cigarette in front of the mirror in the bathroom.
0:57:50|0:58:9|[Zhuo Xiaolin], holding a cigarette, looked at herself with admiration. She lowered her head and chuckled softly. With one hand supporting her arm and the other holding the cigarette, she took a shallow puff, letting the smoke linger in her lungs for a while before slowly exhaling.
0:58:10|0:58:27|Jennifer's bedroom is filled with French romance. Zhuo Xiaolin, wearing an eye mask, is sleeping soundly on the ornate bed. Jennifer takes off her coat, climbs onto the bed, leans down and kisses Zhuo Xiaolin's hand, then kisses her arm as she moves up.
0:58:27|0:58:38|[Duoduo]'s hand rubbed on his stomach back and forth, then there was no movement. [Jennifer]'s hand was propped next to [Duoduo], continuously falling on the chest and face of her young boyfriend underneath.
0:58:49|0:59:0|[Jennifer] failed to get a kiss, then suddenly got out of bed and opened the curtains.
0:59:47|0:59:51|[Zhuo Xiaolin] woke up with an upgraded bad mood turning into anger, and she got out of bed, speaking without filter.
1:0:2|1:0:22|[Zhuo Xiaolin] sighed heavily, walked to the window with his shirt off, and pulled open a gap in the curtain, trying to breathe in the air outside. [Jennifer] wiped away tears as she watched her leave. [Zhuo Xiaolin] returned to his photography studio, threw his coat on the table, and sat angrily in the chair.
1:0:22|1:0:25|She turned on the desk lamp, but her emotions did not calm down.
1:0:30|1:0:51|[Jennifer] lay on the bed, covering her eyes and crying. She wiped away the tears from the corners of her eyes with the back of her hand. [Young Shopkeeper] sat in the studio for a long time, took out her phone to contact [Jennifer], but her finger hovered over the screen without pressing it. She stared at the phone, tightly pursed her lips, and after much thought, she finally put down the phone.
1:0:51|1:0:56|She looked out the window, tiredly resting her hand on her forehead and closing her eyes in contemplation.
1:1:10|1:1:20|In the tea house, [Ma Dongmei] placed an exquisite gift box on the table. Seeing [Ma Dongmei] staring at the phone, she picked up a teacup and persuaded him.
1:2:5|1:2:16|[Zhuo Xiaolin] looked at her mother's worried expression, reached out and touched her face, comforting her.
1:2:22|1:2:37|Watching [Duoduo] pick up the gift and leave, [Duoduo]'s mother felt a little relieved. [Jennifer] fell asleep in the tent in the living room, with her two dolls lying on either side of her. She held one of them tightly as she drifted off to sleep.
1:2:37|1:2:45|In her dream, with messy hair and pale lips, she saw Zhuo Xiaolin and other female models hugging each other, while she herself hid aside and cried silently.
1:2:46|1:3:0|Jennifer wakes up, looks at the laptop, and lights a cigarette. On the screen is Da Miao's Weibo album, with a girl hugging Da Miao from behind while he is working. She appears frequently in Da Miao's photos. Jennifer smokes and gazes at these pictures.
1:3:1|1:3:21|He seemed to enter the scene in the photo, watching [Zhuo Xiaolin] playing snooker with the girl in the billiard room, watching [Zhuo Xiaolin] closely guiding the girl's body, teaching her how to hold the cue. Coming back to reality, [Jennifer] looked up at the birdcage hanging on the window, where two tiger-striped parrots were inside.
1:3:21|1:3:28|In the health club, the masseur is giving Zhuo Xiaolin a back massage. After the phone is accidentally knocked off, she remembers something.
1:3:33|1:3:43|[Lucy] looked up at [Jennifer] who was soaking in the bathtub. [Jennifer] leaned over the edge of the tub to answer the phone.
1:3:49|1:3:54|Next to the bathtub hangs a layer of gauze, faintly revealing the beautiful back of [Jennifer].
1:4:1|1:4:29|[Jennifer] on the massage bed raised her head again, waving her hand to signal the massage room to leave. [Jennifer] wrapped in a towel walked to the side of [Jennifer], pulling out a few pieces of paper from the nearby box to wipe her tears.
1:4:33|1:4:55|[Lucy] gently stroked [Jennifer]'s long hair, quietly listening to her cry.
1:5:54|1:6:18|Jennifer reached out and embraced Lucy's neck, leaning on her shoulder, unable to speak. In the evening, the street lights by the fountain in the neighborhood shone like fire, and a nanny car slowly drove into the neighborhood. Sitting under the fountain reading a book, [Zhuo Xiaolin] noticed the light from the car headlights and turned to look.
1:6:18|1:6:23|The car came to a stop, [Zhuo Xiaolin] turned around, furrowed her brows and closed the book. She raised her hand to check the time on her watch.
1:6:26|1:6:53|[Kouzi] got off the passenger seat, while [Damao] walked up to [Kouzi] holding a guitar, sighed and said. He shook his head and continued. [Kouzi] smiled happily, took the guitar and held it in her arms, carefully looked at it and said.
1:7:18|1:7:31|[Kouzi] planted a kiss on [Da Miao]'s face, happily hugged the guitar and walked towards other residential buildings. This scene was clearly seen by [Zhuo Xiaolin] behind the fountain, who took a deep breath and tightly pursed her lips.
1:7:31|1:7:38|Upon arriving home, [Zhuo Xiaolin] sat on the sofa and looked through the receipts in [Duoduo]'s bag, while [Duoduo] came over to protect the bag.
1:7:52|1:7:55|Zhuo Xiaolin gazes intently at Duoduo.
1:8:17|1:8:35|[Kouzi] turned around in anger, ignoring him. Shortly after, [Kouzi] began to tidy up the clothes in the wardrobe, while [Zhuo Xiaolin] sat in front of the computer observing silently. [Kouzi] threw the large suitcase from the wardrobe onto the bed, quickly stuffing all the clothes into it, and [Zhuo Xiaolin] did not intervene at all.
1:8:35|1:8:41|In a blink of an eye, [Duoduo] was sitting in the passenger seat next to Tianye, the wind blowing through his hair, his eyes looking lost and helpless.
1:8:43|1:9:2|The heavy rain poured down, but the night market was as lively as ever. [Zhuo Xiaolin] walked towards a familiar food stall with her umbrella. She slowly closed the umbrella and sat down at an empty table. The seats behind her were all taken, and in front of her, [Jennifer] and [Young Shopkeeper] were sitting at the table next to hers.
1:9:2|1:9:20|[Duoduo] mischievously opened her mouth and asked [Jennifer] for a tangyuan to eat. [Jennifer] pretended to spit out the tangyuan from her mouth and teased her by biting it at the corner of her mouth. Unexpectedly, [Duoduo] took a bite of the tangyuan, smiling mischievously. [Zhuo Xiaolin] absentmindedly watched this affectionate couple, feeling melancholic as she sat alone by the bedside late at night.
1:9:20|1:9:32|[Zhuo Xiaolin] stood under the shower head in the bathroom, showering without turning on the light. Her eyes were fixed on a spot on the wall, gradually focusing on a photo of [Duoduo] looking back with a wooden expression, smiling brightly.
1:9:32|1:9:49|Next to the peanut paste stall, [Duoduo] yawned lightly while checking the goods, unaware of the engineering student [Zhuo Xiaolin] walking up behind him with a suitcase. [Zhuo Xiaolin] had lost his usual vigor, wearing only a loose long-sleeved t-shirt, and he looked lost as he gazed at [Duoduo]'s back.
1:9:50|1:10:7|[Duoduo] noticed his gaze, turned to look, and the two of them looked at each other in silence. Finally, they sat at a nearby noodle stall, with [Li Gongnan] bowing his head and wolfing down a bowl of noodles, while [Duoduo] sat with arms crossed, coldly watching him, the chopsticks in front of her not moving at all.
1:10:7|1:10:20|In the bedroom of the bridal chamber, [Duoduo] sits in front of the dressing table, caressing the embossed gold characters on the marriage certificate. [Li Gongnan] sits on the edge of the bed, wearily closes his eyes, shakes his head with two fingers, looks up at the sky and sighs.
1:10:20|1:10:32|The room was eerily quiet, [Duoduo] stared at the marriage certificate in her hand, then suddenly picked up the lighter next to her and pressed the ignition button repeatedly. [Li Gongnan] put on his glasses and looked at [Duoduo].
1:10:49|1:10:55|On the dressing table, there is a photo of the two embracing closely. [Duoduo] presses the lighter to ignite a corner of the marriage certificate.
1:10:57|1:11:16|In the flickering flames, [Duoduo] calmly throws the marriage certificate on the table, his eyes empty. The [Engineering Student] behind him looks at the fire through the mirror, with no expression on his face. In the airport lobby, a panicked young man rushes in, who is none other than [Da Miao] that Wen Xun came to meet.
1:11:16|1:11:24|He looked around at the entrance, checked the flight schedule on the electronic screen, and then hurriedly went to the direct hit counter to make a phone call.
1:11:25|1:11:43|She kept talking on the phone, but received no response. She hung up the phone and looked around, standing in place crying like a lost child. [Duoduo] walked aimlessly to the familiar night market, then arrived at Jennifer's house, sitting on the second floor railing looking down.
1:11:49|1:12:1|From this angle, you can see the translucent tent in the living room, as if Jennifer is still sleeping inside. Zhuo Xiaolin lies in the tent, hugging a doll and feeling the lover's breath embroidered on the doll.
1:12:1|1:12:11|The next morning, [Zhuo Xiaolin] sat on the roof with a birdcage. One parrot in the cage was quietly perched on the crossbar, while the other was flapping its wings between the bars, trying to fly out.
1:12:12|1:12:27|He opened the cage door, slowly reached in, grabbed the cheerful parrot, brought it close to his eyes, then released it. Next, he caught another one, blew on its feathers and examined it carefully for a moment, then let it go as if relieved. Tianye stood on the stage at the concert.
1:12:45|1:12:57|Tianye turned to look at the stage, where Duoduo and Young Shopkeeper were sitting side by side in the audience, waving glow sticks wildly. Jennifer, wearing a sleeveless lace dress, walked up to the stage with a smile and embraced Tianye.
1:13:38|1:13:46|Duoduo, with tears in her eyes, looked at Zhuo Xiaolin with relief, while Zhuo Xiaolin gazed at the audience below the stage.
1:13:57|1:14:1|[Duoduo] smiled gently and nodded silently.
1:14:20|1:14:27|[Zhuo Xiaolin] had tears in her eyes, and [Duoduo] looked at her, nodding confidently and giving her a thumbs up.
1:14:38|1:14:51|Duoduo covered his face in the audience, almost unable to control the surging tears. Soon, he smiled and grabbed the Young Shopkeeper next to him to wave glow sticks for Zhuo Xiaolin. Zhuo Xiaolin picked up the microphone again.
1:15:2|1:15:7|The Young Shopkeeper cheered loudly for Zhuo Xiaolin, and the audience around also applauded and cheered along.
1:15:11|1:15:30|Kuzi looked down at the audience below with a sorrowful expression, the accompaniment playing as he closed his eyes and held back his tears. He lightly tapped his forehead with his fingers, held the microphone in his hand, and gazed at the night sky. The dazzling stage lights shone on him, sparkling like stars.
1:17:9|1:17:27|[Duoduo] flashes through countless scenes with [Zhuo Xiaolin] in her mind. She turns on the stage and secretly wipes away the tears on her cheeks. Just as she wipes her wrist, another tear slips from the corner of her eye. At this moment, [Duoduo] is completely unaware that the person she misses has already stepped onto the stage behind her.
1:17:27|1:17:33|When she composed herself and turned around to continue singing, she was surprised to see a familiar figure walking up beside her.
1:17:34|1:17:41|[Zhuo Xiaolin]'s shoulders were broad, his figure tall, dressed in a casual knitted jacket, but his gaze towards her was particularly tender.
1:17:48|1:18:12|[Zhuo Xiaolin] walked onto the stage with tears in his eyes, gently looking at [Duoduo]. [Duoduo] held the microphone and gazed at him, singing this love song, steadily approaching him step by step. Countless spotlights focused on this reunited couple. Suddenly, [Duoduo] tilted his head slightly, and unexpectedly fell on the stage.
1:18:12|1:18:16|[Zhuo Xiaolin] knelt beside [Duoduo] in a panic, holding his face and shouting loudly.
1:18:23|1:18:37|[Zhuo Xiaolin] and [Duoduo] got on the ambulance, the vehicle's tail lights fading into the distance. The concert venue was now empty, with only [Jennifer] left crouching in front of the large poster of her and [Duoduo]. She anxiously swayed her body, tilting her head up as if praying for [Duoduo].
1:18:44|1:18:48|In the ambulance, [Zhuo Xiaolin] is in tears.
1:18:58|1:19:19|He looked at [Duoduo], shaking his head in regret. In front of him, [Duoduo] lay on a stretcher, eyes tightly shut. [Zhuo Xiaolin] buried his head in his hands, crying quietly.
1:19:24|1:19:40|She cried until her ears were congested, using the back of her hand to continuously wipe away the tears that fell. [Button]'s hand suddenly lifted and touched her hair, helping to smooth it out. [Zhuo Xiaolin] slowly raised her head, as if waking from a dream, and held onto this hand to caress it.
1:19:40|1:19:44|She met the gaze of [Zhuo Xiaolin], and the two remained silent, yet all misunderstandings were dispelled.
1:19:45|1:19:56|The screen fades to black, and a year later, the night market in the ancient city is brightly lit, with various food stalls lining the streets as far as the eye can see. The streets are bustling with a crowd of people, creating a lively atmosphere.
1:19:56|1:20:11|The customer flow in one of the shops was particularly high, with several large characters written on the antique flag: "Da Song Peanut Cake, Kaifeng Specialty, Handmade." [Young Shopkeeper] swung a wooden hammer to make the cakes, shirtless, while [Duoduo] carved melon seeds on the side. The two of them loudly hawked their goods.
1:20:20|1:20:25|Nian Tanxiang saw [Zhuo Xiaolin] writing on the desk pad, while [Duoduo] walked in with a thoughtful expression.
1:20:51|1:21:7|Tianye's smile is frozen in the frame, [Zhuo Xiaolin] arrives in the open countryside, using the camera to record every scene he observes. He captures the beautiful scenery along the way, visits the elderly left behind, and takes the only group photo for the elderly couple in the village.
1:21:7|1:21:17|He walked along the narrow ancient stone steps in the countryside, strolling on the field path lined with lush green grass on both sides, standing on a small hill to take pictures of the distant scenery, stretching his arms to bask in the sunlight.
1:21:18|1:21:41|[Zhuo Xiaolin] came to the rural primary school, distributing white paper to the children, teaching them to draw and write, and using a camera to record their learning achievements. Sitting at the airport, [Jennifer] watched the video sent by [Zhuo Xiaolin] on her laptop.
1:21:48|1:21:54|[Jennifer], who has changed her previous style, tied her hair in a refreshing ponytail as she watched the video with keen eyes.
