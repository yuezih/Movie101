0:3:2|0:3:18|So he quickly gave instructions over the walkie-talkie hanging by his ear. Five vehicles split into three routes to search for the Li Jian Ancient City. Soon, four vehicles continued to move forward against the biting wind and snow, while [Huo An] and [Lu Kuisi] chose to hike over the mountains on foot.
0:3:18|0:3:37|After helping each other climb over one mountain after another, they were surprised to see a scene of ruins and debris. Under the heavy snow, it seemed to be the remains of a village, with the once orderly houses now reduced to beams standing in place.
0:3:37|0:3:52|The two of them immediately smiled at each other upon seeing this, and continued to explore forward. Soon they discovered several arches belonging to the Roman style not far away. It seemed that Huo An's military manual was correct, and Liqian Ancient City was not just a legend.
0:3:52|0:4:7|Therefore, they quickened their pace, swiftly crossing the arch that almost reached the clouds, and stopped in front of a staircase. [Huo An] bent down, sweeping away the thick snow, revealing the two characters carved on the bronze, [Li Jian].
0:4:8|0:4:18|[Lu Kuisi] joyfully shouted, then used both hands to vigorously sweep away the accumulated snow. Finally, at this moment, the bronze inscription on the monument was fully revealed.
0:4:19|0:4:24|Even after experiencing wind and frost, one can still see the majestic and noble appearance of [Huo An].
0:4:27|0:4:34|At this moment, [Huo An] took off his computer and instructed [Lu Kuisi] to take out the scanner, inserting it into the snow to use satellite technology to restore the former glory of the Li Jian Ancient City.
0:5:21|0:5:30|Just as the two were amazed, suddenly, a slightly stone statue reappeared at the top of the towering pillar in front of them.
0:5:32|0:5:45|Upon closer inspection, the figure wore a helmet with a sharp ridge, carrying a set of iron leaf armor on the shoulders, with a gold-trimmed collar, and front and back chest armor plates. A stone-like raptor wing was connected to its back.
0:5:46|0:5:56|Under the cold winter, the snow attached to the stone statue emits a faint light in the cold Sun Palace, and one can even hear the roar of a tiger in the distance.
0:5:59|0:6:18|Sitting steadily in the center of the ancient city, overlooking all beings, this armor must belong to the war god [Huo An]. So [Lu Kuisi] and [Leng Yue] quickly used satellites to scan it. Thus, through this armor, the movie "The Lion Roars" that we are going to talk about today officially begins.
0:6:20|0:6:29|In the year 48 BC, on the border of the Great Han Silk Road, thirty-six ethnic groups had to kill each other in order to survive.
0:6:31|0:6:40|As the Grand Commander of the Western Regions Protectorate, [Huo An] takes it upon himself to maintain peace in the Western Regions. Upon hearing about the unrest at the border, he hastily leads his troops to the scene.
0:6:42|0:6:59|With his hair tied behind his head and a beard braided, wearing the robe of the Protectorate, Huo An quickly spotted two groups of soldiers in black and white below the mountain valley. He immediately signaled to his men beside him.
0:7:6|0:7:14|Another subordinate of Huo An heard about it, took out a heavy book, observed the attire and weapons of both sides in the valley, and compared them with the patterns in the book.
0:7:48|0:7:53|As soon as the words fell, one of Huo An's subordinates, wielding a long-handled wolf-toothed club, led a charge on horseback.
0:7:54|0:8:13|Before getting close, [Hong Ri] by Iron Chieftain's side immediately released the fierce eagle, and after pecking the eye of the warhorse, he rode closer and knocked the opponent down with one palm. Seeing the excited [Hong Ri] already fallen off the horse, [Huo An] quickly led his men, charging straight down from the mountaintop.
0:8:14|0:8:22|In the scorching desert, [Hong Ri] swiftly circled behind the opponent, lifting him over his head several times before forcefully slamming him into the sand.
0:8:31|0:8:42|Upon hearing the opponent's insults, [Leng Yue] was instantly ignited with anger. With a swift horse stance, she charged forward and fiercely cracked her whip, striking the opponent's back forcefully.
0:8:45|0:8:56|Watching as [Leng Yue] swung her leg down from above, landing a heavy blow with a slanting hook on the chin of a soldier from the White Clothes Army. [Huo An] quickly covered his left arm with a small shield, arriving by the side of the White Clothes soldier, successfully blocking [Leng Yue]'s deadly strike.
0:9:6|0:9:12|On the other side, Huo An revealed his identity as the commander of the Western Regions Protectorate. Seeing him bowing sincerely and respectfully, the White Feather chieftain signaled his tribesmen to stay calm.
0:9:45|0:9:55|[Huo An] listened and then glanced at the Bai Rong people beside him. He first used a small shield to block the stones, and then grabbed the oncoming long whip.
0:10:10|0:10:28|Agilely dodging several attacks, [Huo An] seized the opportunity to grab the long whip, firmly stepping on [Leng Yue]'s attacking foot, directly immobilizing her in front of him. At this moment, [Leng Yue] forcefully pushed forward, and as [Huo An] fell to the ground, his hands landed straight on her chest, placing her horizontally above him.
0:10:30|0:10:38|[Huo An], who was slapped in the face, explained.
0:10:46|0:10:55|Saying that, [Huo An] smiled and casually threw the long sword hanging behind him. Realizing that the man underestimated her, [Leng Yue] raised her twin knives and stood up.
0:10:55|0:11:22|With a swift turn, she managed to pierce the armor on [Huo An]'s chest directly. Then, seizing the advantage, she pursued, her fingers dancing as she swung the curved blade towards [Huo An]'s neck. As he leaned back to avoid it, [Leng Yue] stepped forward, planting herself between [Huo An]'s feet. With a forceful twist of her ankle, she swung her body forward in succession, narrowly missing his head with the blade tip, only to find [Huo An] had already escaped.
0:11:24|0:11:28|[Leng Yue] frowned, the curved blade in her left hand flew off her wrist and stabbed straight into the ground beside [Huo An].
0:11:29|0:11:46|Without waiting for [Huo An] to bend down and pull out, [Leng Yue] swiftly approached like lightning and sent him flying straight up. Then she bent down and pulled back her curved blade, aiming a scorpion tail strike directly at [Huo An]'s face. Unexpectedly, he protected his ankle. So [Leng Yue] simply twisted her body, with both hands propped on the sandy ground.
0:11:46|0:11:52|The other leg exerted force, and the curved hook on the sole instantly cut [Huo An]'s forearm, breaking free from the restraints.
0:11:52|0:12:10|Forced by circumstances, [Huo An] no longer dodged, clamping the curved blade brought by [Leng Yue] under his armpit, and then seizing her in front of him. Unexpectedly, when [Leng Yue] struggled and shook her head, her veil was accidentally torn off by [Huo An]. The onlookers fell silent at this scene.
0:12:14|0:12:32|The Iron Evil Khan turned his head awkwardly, [Hong Ri] widened his eyes and glared angrily at [Huo An], while [Huo An] looked down at the veil in his hand, at a loss. On the way back to the city, [Huo An] could only face the teasing of his brothers.
0:12:43|0:12:56|In the palace of the country of Huo An, [Huo An] took the wine glass boldly under the daring gaze of [Leng Yue]. Before [Huo An] could finish drinking, [Leng Yue] unexpectedly stripped naked in front of him, causing him to spit out the wine in his mouth in shock.
0:13:14|0:13:26|Sitting on the horse, [Huo An] laughed and playfully patted the chest of his subordinate [Mountain Leopard], then tightened the saddle and rode straight towards home on his warhorse. Finally, before the sunset, the group wrapped in sand and wind returned to the town.
0:14:9|0:14:16|[Huo An], who entered pushing a wooden lunch box, looked up and saw the lyrics written by [Xiu Qing], and couldn't help but sing along.
0:14:46|0:14:56|At this moment, [Huo An] stood in front of the desk dictating while having [Xiu Qing] write down the memorial to be presented to the Grand Commandant.
0:15:0|0:15:16|[Huo An] awkwardly tightened his hands that were crossed in front of his chest, then walked to the side, poured a bowl of wine, and drank it down in big gulps. [Xiu Qing] then patted his shoulder and said.
0:15:32|0:15:44|Lowering his head to look at the resolute [Xiu Qing], [Huo An] had just raised his arms to embrace her when suddenly a knock on the door was heard. Opening the door, he saw the solemn-faced [Yin Po] with his hair combed back.
0:15:53|0:15:59|And around those heavy boxes filled with gold coins, there were several bodies lying dead in a row.
0:16:8|0:16:14|Upon hearing this, [Huo An] widened his eyes, put on his outer robe, picked up his sword, and then rushed out the door.
0:16:15|0:16:26|Looking at the soldiers outside the Protectorate, he quickly stepped into the hall and shouted anxiously at [Huo An]'s subordinates who were handcuffed.
0:16:37|0:16:50|The contemptuous attitude of the centurion immediately prompted [Yin Po] to draw his sword. [Huo An] held his forearm and said in a low voice.
0:17:1|0:17:25|The captain showed the prefect's token, and with a few words announced the future of [Huo An] and his men. Before dawn, the group was taken onto a prisoner wagon and headed towards Yanmen Pass. By dusk, the wagon was still wandering in the desolate mountains and deserts.
0:18:18|0:18:29|[Huo An], after calming the emotions of his brothers, sat in the prisoner car and assured them firmly. As dusk fell, the prisoner car arrived in front of a dilapidated city wall that was ten stories high.
0:18:31|0:18:39|Through the cracks of the prisoner car, you can faintly see some of the slaves repairing the arrow tower with sand, wood, and stones.
0:18:42|0:18:56|[Huo An] and his group, following the team that had also been enslaved, slowly walked through the city gate after removing their handcuffs and leg irons. Looking around, prisoners from various tribes were pulling hemp ropes and methodically moving earth and stones.
0:18:57|0:19:3|In front of the only intact pointed gate, Huo An and his group stopped their steps.
0:19:4|0:19:11|The armor and spirit tablet of Huo Qubing were originally seated on the stone platform, overlooking the front.
0:19:16|0:19:22|Looking at the old armor and spirit tablet in front of him, [Huo An] recalled the scene of his first meeting with the general.
0:19:24|0:19:38|At that time, Huo An led his troops to patrol the border. The infuriated Kucha people, after being repeatedly defeated, kidnapped Han children. When the two armies met, they opened the prisoner carriage and enjoyed the thrill of hunting down Han people in front of him.
0:19:40|0:19:43|The war may have ended, but [Huo Qubing] shed tears as he looked at the bodies of the elderly, weak, and sick.
0:19:50|0:19:57|At this moment, [Huo An], who had lost his sister, took advantage of [Huo Qubing]'s unpreparedness, snatched the short blade from his waist, and stabbed it into [Huo Qubing]'s side.
0:19:58|0:20:6|With a loud shout, [Huo Qubing] ordered his subordinates to step back. [Huo An] knelt in front of him, one hand covering his abdomen, the other hand on [Huo An]'s shoulder, murmuring.
0:20:18|0:20:23|And then, [Huo An] took it upon himself to help others, striving to maintain peace on the border.
0:20:24|0:20:31|Looking at the tablet of their benefactor, a group of brothers followed [Huo An], placing one hand over their chest and bowing reverently.
0:20:37|0:20:40|On the other side, the Wusun people stood on a high point, using roller-skate devices to direct the Nandi people on the ground to pull back, allowing the stones to smoothly ascend.
0:20:42|0:20:49|Unexpectedly, the long wooden support on the ground suddenly broke, and the stones fell directly onto the wooden frame, causing the Wusun man to fall from a height to the ground.
0:20:51|0:20:58|Huo An, who rushed over in a hurry to save someone, was unexpectedly hit by a falling plank.
0:21:12|0:21:21|Seeing the Turks pushing the Nan Di people to the ground and kicking them angrily, Huo An quickly grabbed the opponent's headscarf and pressed it fiercely onto the wooden cart.
0:21:39|0:21:44|Huo An, who hurriedly stepped onto the steps, was just about to declare his identity to the Southern Di people when a horizontally swung iron hammer struck towards him.
0:21:46|0:21:53|And at the foot of the city wall, several Southern Di people joined forces to push down the piled-up logs, causing each one to arch towards the Tujue people.
0:21:54|0:22:11|But [Huo An] had no time to deal with the distant farce, so he had to first separate the fighting Tujue and Wusun people in front of him. Unfortunately, neither side was willing to stop first. In desperation, [Huo An] could only strike with his left palm at the throat of one side, and his right fist heavily hammered on the shoulder of the other.
0:22:11|0:22:20|Seeing people from various tribes joining the fight, [Huo An] hurriedly intervened in Turkic. At this moment, the soldiers on the city tower sounded the bronze gong.
0:22:33|0:22:42|After the troublemakers were scolded and taken away by the soldiers, [Huo An] and his group were brought before the captain [Yan Tou] and the army doctor [Lao Shu] at Yanmen Pass.
0:23:19|0:23:22|As soon as the words fell, [Lao Shu] handed over a precious sword.
0:23:39|0:23:45|Seeing [Yan Tou] in front of him, clad in heavy armor and trying to look fierce, [Huo An] led the others to turn and leave.
0:23:47|0:23:53|The city, which was once filled with dust from fighting, has now been restored to its original state, and prisoners from various tribes are diligently repairing the city walls.
0:23:54|0:24:14|At noon the next day, a group of soldiers wearing red phosphorus helmets, metal plate armor, wielding short sharp swords, and bronze greaves on their legs, rode swiftly on warhorses. The leader had a pair of mastiffs on his shoulders, black feathers on his helmet, and armor on the horse's face, all indicating his special status.
0:24:14|0:24:20|This is the Roman first warrior [Lu Kuisi], and the group of cavalry behind him are his brave warriors who are skilled in battle.
0:24:28|0:24:51|Upon hearing the deputy Charles's request for the next plan, Huo An first inquired about the current situation of the army. Learning that there were less than eight hundred soldiers, and less than three thousand crossbows, and the army was lacking water and strength, he couldn't help but turn around and look towards the only carriage in the formation. Then he dismounted and quickly walked to the front of the carriage.
0:24:51|0:25:5|As the attendant Hua Gao opened the carriage door, [Lu Kuisi] quickly bent down. On the silk scarf, the little prince Pris, dressed in royal attire and wearing a crown, slowly opened his eyes upon hearing the sound, constantly reaching out with both hands.
0:25:27|0:25:36|Therefore, it didn't take long to capture the city. Then, taking the water bag from the flower expert, [Huo An] quickly brought it to the prince's lips, carefully serving him to drink it sip by sip.
0:25:38|0:25:43|Then he heard the other side say that he was waiting for the good news of his victory on the carriage.
0:25:45|0:25:52|Thus, [Lu Kuisi], who wanted to quickly resolve the battle, rode through the wind and sand to the city gates.
0:25:53|0:25:59|Upon seeing the foreign troops attacking from outside the city, the soldiers hurriedly beat the drums, and [Huo An] and his group quickly ran towards the city wall.
0:26:1|0:26:11|The soldiers guarding the city were already holding bows and arrows, hiding behind the battlements, waiting only for the command.
0:26:21|0:26:36|Ignoring the obstruction of [Huo An], the defending soldiers in the city shot arrows in unison. [Lu Kuisi]'s warhorse looked at the arrows sinking into the desert in front of its hooves, immediately halting. Then, [Lu Kuisi] unexpectedly turned around, roaring to retreat.
0:26:50|0:27:10|[Yan Tou] lifted the hands of [Huo An] holding onto his arms, then ordered to open the city gates wide and led over a hundred elite soldiers to chase after [Lu Kuisi] in the direction he fled. In no time, the two groups of troops had already galloped five miles away. Under the scorching sun, hooves kicked up sand as hot waves rose in the desert.
0:27:11|0:27:17|Single-mindedly pursuing the enemy, [Yan Tou] naturally failed to notice the ambush hidden not far ahead in the sandy ground.
0:27:18|0:27:29|At this moment, [Lu Kuisi] turned around and smiled suddenly, leading his legion to gallop past. A hemp rope suddenly rose from the sand, and [Yan Tou], who couldn't stop in time, was directly whipped off his horse by the rope.
0:27:29|0:27:45|A plan executed, and immediately two groups of Roman soldiers emerged from the sand. Two tightly stretched hemp ropes instantly pulled [Yan Tou]'s subordinates off their horses. Despite the choking sand dust, everyone intended to abandon their horses and flee, unaware that the legion with long shields and short swords had turned back at this moment.
0:28:0|0:28:4|[Huo An] ignored [Lao Shu]'s words and then turned and walked down the city tower.
0:28:6|0:28:16|At this moment, Sima led a group of soldiers and cat demons to sneak to the bottom of the arrow tower, while [Lao Shu] and [Mountain Leopard] directed everyone to raise the military flags and quickly rush to each arrow helm.
0:28:17|0:28:39|As [Lu Kuisi] was giving the order and shouting for the legion to break into the city, the beacon on the city wall was lit up, signaling the guard's declaration. The soldiers who were originally crouching behind the arrow shields quickly and orderly raised the military flags. In an instant, the military flags emerged like spring rain after a downpour, popping out from every crenelation on the city wall.
0:28:39|0:28:48|[Lu Kuisi] saw the situation and turned his head in confusion to look at his deputy Charles. Then he turned back and faced the archers on the opposite arrow tower, who were already poised to shoot.
0:28:55|0:29:8|Upon seeing the legion stop advancing, [Lao Shu] cheered with joy. Then, [Huo An] led his brothers from the Protectorate out of the city to meet the enemy in battle. Upon closer inspection, he was actually wearing the same Cloud Roll Armor worn by General Huo Yuanjia.
0:29:9|0:29:32|Sitting on the horse with a sword in hand, exuding a majestic and imposing aura, [Lu Kuisi] faced the unfamiliar face that suddenly appeared and rode towards [Huo An]. Seeing the opponent dismount suddenly, he also walked towards [Huo An]. Amidst the flying yellow sand, [Lu Kuisi] stood ten steps away, drew his short sword, and announced his identity.
0:29:54|0:29:56|[Huo An] refused to agree to the other party's unreasonable request.
0:29:56|0:30:19|Therefore, [Lu Kuisi] raised his head to signal that a battle was inevitable. Seeing him brandish his short sword, [Huo An] also threw out his flying claws. He passed the sword hilt and then with a strong swing, tossed the scabbard to Lao Hu. The long sword sparkled with cold light under the sunlight. In the midst of the confrontation, [Lu Kuisi] took the initiative, wielding his short sword to strike directly at [Huo An]'s face and back.
0:30:19|0:30:30|Then, Chen Jian knocked him out and took advantage of his unpreparedness, striking a sword straight at [Huo An]'s head. Fortunately, [Huo An]'s helmet was still sturdy enough, with only a thin layer of copper shaved off between the sword.
0:30:30|0:30:43|When retreating, slightly shorter [Lu Kuisi] by half a head than [Huo An], accidentally hit the opponent's helmet. The two stepped back, and at this moment, [Huo An] saw the Roman soldier falling straight off his horse, his armor intact.
0:30:48|0:31:2|Without waiting for a word, [Lu Kuisi] had already killed in front. [Huo An] blocked with his hand, then hung the long sword, circling around the left arm guard to stab towards [Lu Kuisi]. The blade directly slashed the armor on the opponent's waist side.
0:31:14|0:31:27|[Lu Kuisi] was like a sword god today, his opponent seemed too clumsy to win. The young prince grinned with cracked lips. At that moment, [Lu Kuisi] grabbed [Huo An]'s right wrist with one hand.
0:31:27|0:31:47|Another hand raised the sword towards the top again, intending to finish him off while he was down. Unexpectedly, [Huo An] rolled in place, swung his right wrist, and after the long sword was thrown into the air, it was pulled back into his hand, allowing him to charge straight towards [Lu Kuisi]'s face without moving forward. Then, [Huo An] grabbed [Lu Kuisi]'s wrist and kicked hard, knocking him to the ground.
0:31:47|0:32:8|With his hands tied behind his back, [Yan Tou] knelt on the ground and roared defiantly, while [Lu Kuisi] got back up, weighing the short sword in his hand, signaling [Huo An] to continue. At this moment, [Sima] shouted loudly. The overwhelming sand extended and enlarged.
0:32:16|0:32:33|Just now leisurely eating pastries, [Lu Kuisi] turned back to look at the raging sandstorm, then quickly leaned into the carriage to check on the condition of the young prince. Sensing the danger, [Lu Kuisi] once again drew his short sword and lunged at [Huo An], then used both hands to hold the long sword in front of him.
0:32:34|0:32:51|Unexpectedly, [Huo An] swiftly turned his wrist, causing both of them to hold their swords horizontally at each other's necks. At this moment, Hua Gao sorrowfully rushed to the front of the formation, holding the unconscious young prince. [Huo An] then pushed upwards with all his strength, causing both of them to quickly retreat.
0:33:7|0:33:21|Otherwise, if we keep fighting, everyone will be buried alive by the sandstorm, including the Little Prince. [Lu Kuisi] gasped and looked at [Huo An] on the other side. Then he saw him unexpectedly pull the flying claws from the hilt of the sword and thrust the sword straight into the sand in front of him.
0:33:23|0:33:39|So [Lu Kuisi] lowered the tip of his sword and walked straight towards [Huo An]. Standing in front of the long sword, he swallowed hard, thought for a moment, and then spoke. The army now needs food and water, while the young prince needs medicine.
0:33:41|0:33:56|Then he loosened his hand, and the short sword fell with a clatter. After a moment of thought, he said he also needed to find a place to think carefully. The deal was reached. As night fell, after the sandstorm had passed, the area outside Yan Tou Pass was in a mess.
0:33:57|0:34:18|In the city, under the large stone pillar, surrounded by swirling smoke and fire, Roman soldiers were lying on the steps in a twisted manner. Although their tired and hungry bodies found some comfort, each soldier did not sleep soundly. With their dirty faces, even in their dreams, they still placed their hands on their chests, praying that the little prince inside the house was safe and sound.
0:34:18|0:34:29|In the brightly lit room, [Lao Shu] picked up a long needle from the medicine box and approached the bed. He lifted the hem of the little prince's royal robe and forcefully pierced it below the navel.
0:34:29|0:34:43|[Lu Kuisi], [Huo An], and [Yan Tou] were anxiously waiting by the bedside, and when [Lao Shu] slowly removed the needle, the young prince suddenly woke up shouting [Lu Kuisi]'s name.
0:34:48|0:34:55|After touching the hands extended by [Lu Kuisi], he anxiously asked, "In the duel with the Chinese warriors, the winner is the Roman legion, right?"
0:35:16|0:35:24|[Huo An] listened and then smirked.
0:35:32|0:35:47|Not understanding English, [Yan Tou] was deceived by [Huo An] and repeated the words fiercely before throwing off his robe and walking outside. When the little prince fell asleep again peacefully, [Lu Kuisi] embarked alone on a broken city wall.
0:35:48|0:36:7|The moon was bright and the stars sparse, with only wooden frames and scattered rocks used to repair the city walls. This was undoubtedly an excellent place for contemplation. He then recalled the scene when he was in a beautifully decorated palace.
0:36:7|0:36:32|A man wearing heavy armor and a stubble beard walked slowly, holding not a sword but a small vial of night light. The young prince lying on the bed saw the man and instantly smiled sweetly. The man then dripped the medicine from the vial into a bowl, and after the young prince drank it, he experienced excruciating pain.
0:36:34|0:36:42|In the chaos, [Lu Kuisi] fought his way out, handed the young prince to Huagao, and led a group of soldiers to cover the rear.
0:36:43|0:36:50|At this moment, a strange noise came from behind [Lu Kuisi], and when he turned around, it was [Huo An].
0:36:55|0:37:2|Next, picking up the wine pot placed on the city wall, [Huo An] first filled up [Lu Kuisi]'s cup, then lifted another bowl filled with strong liquor.
0:37:9|0:37:14|Although the stimulation behind his head made his facial features frown, [Huo An] signaled to be filled up again.
0:37:33|0:37:39|He would be confused and at a loss, even finding there was no way to go. He asked curiously.
0:37:55|0:38:1|[Lu Kuisi] sneered at this, saying that in today's world, peace is nothing but a dream.
0:38:5|0:38:11|Then he drew [Huo An]'s long sword and examined it carefully, indicating that he had no intention of hostility, just curiosity.
0:39:26|0:39:34|[Lu Kuisi] quickly stepped back upon seeing the situation, exclaiming why this person always looks so gloomy.
0:40:1|0:40:12|[Huo An] immediately retorted to [Lu Kuisi], "Yan Tou believes in you." At this moment, [Lu Kuisi] proposed a condition for exchange: if [Huo An] wanted to repair the city wall within 15 days, he must find someone to take his deputy to the Kingdom of Anxi.
0:40:15|0:40:22|After both sides reached an agreement, [Lao Shu] spread out a map on the table.
0:40:26|0:40:35|In the western region of China, the Kingdom of Anxi is located to the northwest of Yan Tou Pass. Huo An then orders Mountain Leopard to bring his deputy and a group of six people to ride horses swiftly away.
0:40:36|0:40:40|Next, they began repairing the Great Wall.
0:40:48|0:40:57|Inside the military tent, Roman soldiers orderly moved all the scrolls and documents on the wooden table aside, then brought various measuring tools and drawing instruments.
0:40:57|0:41:13|Later, [Lu Kuisi] led a group of Roman soldiers to the broken city wall. Two soldiers stood on either side of the high wall, one holding a crossbow, shooting short arrows with long ropes attached to the other side. The other soldier marked the length of the rope and reported it to [Lu Kuisi].
0:41:13|0:41:31|Continuing, he took out parchment and sketched the appearance of the city wall, recording it in a book. Noting the width of the damaged sections of the wall, the soldiers then brought out a rope with iron blocks hanging from it, hanging it vertically against the wall to measure the height. Watching the busy Roman soldiers measuring, [Lao Shu] said.
0:41:32|0:41:40|The width of the broken section of the city wall is recorded, and soldiers take out a long rope with iron blocks hanging on it, hanging it vertically against the city wall to measure the exact height.
0:41:44|0:42:0|Seeing [Huo An] commanding the crowd, using a round stick to transport stones by placing them on the ground, a Roman soldier stepped forward to demonstrate a simple method. He placed the backs of two curved long shields facing upwards on the ground to support the stones, and with just three people pushing from behind, they were able to smoothly transport them away.
0:42:3|0:42:12|Following that, the soldiers in the city obeyed the orders of [Lu Kuisi], pulling out long wooden poles and carrying them to an open space. They saw someone collapsing due to exhaustion on the ground, and many Tujue people mocked and made fun of them.
0:42:15|0:42:26|A small interlude did not affect the progress of the project. After everyone turned the long wood into long strips, the Roman soldiers pieced them together into a hollow rectangular prism.
0:42:26|0:42:39|Another group of soldiers took off their shirts and exercised iron bars by the furnace. After finishing, they overlapped them in a cross shape, nailed them with iron nails, and then filled the cast iron cage with broken stones.
0:42:44|0:42:56|[Huo An] and others then built several transmission devices with gears according to [Lu Kuisi]'s drawings. The largest gear is about three meters high.
0:42:56|0:43:26|Standing upright in the center of the device, connected to it is a half-height small gear, the only one horizontal gear, also nickel-plated with it. Under the push of a group of Roman soldiers, the three gears interact with each other, driving another set of long hooks on the transmission device. The person above uses it to hook the iron chain on the iron cage on the city wall. With the collective effort of the people, the device hoists the long cage to the damaged part of the city wall.
0:43:55|0:44:1|Wanting to touch the city wall, at the request of the Little Prince, [Lu Kuisi] placed his hands on the arrow rudder in front of him.
0:44:4|0:44:11|The little prince then carefully pressed his ear against it. Suddenly, he shouted out loud.
0:44:12|0:44:14|I felt as if I could see it, even saw myself in the city of Rome.
0:44:29|0:44:39|From time to time, what came into their ears was the music played on the harp by their mother specifically for the two of them. [Lu Kuisi] gradually lost focus as he followed the little prince's memories.
0:44:41|0:44:50|The interruption of "Do you miss him?" broke [Lu Kuisi]'s train of thought. Although silent, the memory of those delicate vermilion lips and watery eyes once again plunged him into contemplation.
0:44:52|0:45:11|A gentle breeze blew, and the two of them rested their chins on the arrow rudder in silence for a long time. The next day at noon, [Huo An] repaired the gaps in the city wall, poured a bowl of wine, and called his brothers over.
0:45:12|0:45:22|Seven people took off their outer robes, neatly placed them on the ground, and then lined up in three rows in front of [Huo An]'s armor.
0:45:23|0:45:30|The originally upright body half squats into a horse stance, with both arms sometimes in a bow-pulling posture and sometimes clenched into fists.
0:45:34|0:45:51|The practice of martial arts quickly attracted everyone's attention. [Yan Tou] had just walked out of the military tent and saw [Huo An] and others bending their bodies low, turning their legs into circles in the air, then leveraging the power of a single arm to leap up from the ground.
0:45:51|0:45:57|At this moment, [Lu Kuisi] arrived with his subordinates upon hearing the noise, and after a brief look, he smiled and turned away.
0:45:59|0:46:12|After warming up, [Huo An] took the lead in pulling out his long sword, hooked the flying claws on the sword handle, slashed and stabbed. Before long, a neat drumbeat sounded in the ears.
0:46:12|0:46:33|Roman soldiers were originally lined up behind the crowd, secretly competing. They turned around to look at the Wusun people who were watching the excitement, and then led some of the crowd behind them. With a command, wearing heavy armor and holding sticks in both hands, the two rows of Roman soldiers facing each other quickly smashed towards each other, followed by punches and shoulder strikes.
0:46:33|0:46:50|[Huo An] caught a glimpse of the scene across from him, saw [Lu Kuisi] give him a crooked smile, then turned and stepped into the ranks. The seven men realigned and took a single step forward, forcefully thrusting their swords straight into the air, then swiftly pulling them back with flying claws.
0:46:50|0:47:15|Continuing, three of them bent down while the other three stepped on their backs and leaped forward. With a stretch and a pull, they once again retrieved their swords. At this moment, the Roman soldiers formed five rows and six columns, holding long spears and shields, standing in formation. With a synchronized step and turn, the original square formation had somehow transformed into the shape of the letter "W".
0:47:16|0:47:19|[Huo An] raised his thumb at the sight of such a formation.
0:47:30|0:47:53|Sima put on the robe of the Protectorate, carried a hoe, walked to the center of the open space, stomped his foot to remove the hoe blade, then placed the long stick horizontally in front of his chest, pointing it at the Roman soldier holding a short stick. The young man couldn't hold back his impatience and attacked first. Unexpectedly, the stick went straight into Sima's armpit.
0:47:53|0:48:9|Being blocked by him in front of him, he attacked the chest with a long stick. The enraged Roman soldier immediately used two sticks to smash towards Huo An, his arms contracting and expanding, seemingly about to hit the opponent's face directly, but was suddenly forced to lean back, narrowly avoiding it.
0:48:9|0:48:23|After Sima stood up, he immediately thrust a stick into the soldier's throat, then pursued with another strike to the soldier's lower leg, and finally knocked away his short stick.
0:48:24|0:48:37|The South Di people who had previously bet on the victory of the Protectorate hurriedly walked away upon seeing this. At this moment, the competition entered the second round, with the Roman soldiers entering the center with a stick in one hand and a shield in the other.
0:48:38|0:48:48|Old [Huo An] saw the situation and tightly gripped the unsheathed long sword in his hand, attacking directly towards the opponent. However, every move was blocked by the Roman soldiers' long shields in front of them.
0:48:50|0:49:10|Hearing [Huo An] praise the opponent, the old [Huo An] stood his ground and displayed the Dragon Tail move, kicking the Roman soldier back repeatedly. Then, he mounted the opponent and kicked him in the lower leg, intending to take advantage of the situation. Unexpectedly, the opponent rolled over, grabbed the old [Huo An]'s collar, and executed a shoulder throw.
0:49:10|0:49:27|Next, the Roman soldier placed his shield in front of his chest and pushed old [Huo An] towards the crowd. Seeing old [Huo An] turning around to defend with his long sword, the Roman soldier tilted his shield, pressed the sword to the ground, and forced him to let go. That's how old [Huo An] who had dropped his sword naturally lost the match.
0:49:28|0:49:39|Amid the cheers of the crowd, [Huo An] hung his head in dejection and walked towards the crowd, but the Roman soldier suddenly stopped him and then held up a long sword in front of his chest, offering it with both hands.
0:49:40|0:49:58|And expressed great joy at being able to have such a competition. Old [Huo An] raised his hand to touch his eyebrows, took the opportunity to look back at [Lu Kuisi], saw him gesturing to accept the sword, and had to reach out to take it. Then, looking up again, he found the Roman soldier reaching out his right hand towards him, so old [Huo An] smiled and shook hands with him.
0:50:3|0:50:16|The Roman soldier immediately embraced him in front of him, shouting with excitement. [Huo An] stood in the crowd, showing a relieved smile, and in such an atmosphere, everyone once again immersed themselves in the construction of the Great Wall.
0:50:16|0:50:30|After repairing a section of the city wall, the enthusiastic people pushed the gear mechanism and moved on to the next construction site. In a short period of time, people from thirty-six countries surprisingly established a full understanding.
0:50:30|0:50:46|Pulling out round logs, crushing stones, sawing long strips, transporting sand and soil, everything is being carried out in an orderly and efficient manner. There are no longer any major fights within the city over minor conflicts. During breaks, people from various tribes, after eating and drinking their fill, once again throw themselves into the construction work.
0:50:47|0:50:58|Another day passed in the blink of an eye, [Huo An] stood on the city wall facing the glaring sun. Just as he raised his hand to wipe the sweat off his forehead with his sleeve, he turned around to find that something unexpected had happened inside the city.
0:51:13|0:51:20|The group then collectively propped him up in front of them and quickly gave him water. When the person regained consciousness, everyone burst into joyful laughter.
0:51:42|0:51:53|Continuing, during the break, [Huo An] gathered the representatives of the thirty-six nations inside the military tent and distributed a piece of cloth and a brush to each person.
0:51:54|0:52:1|Huo An grasped the hand of the Little Prince and wrote the name of Rome on the cloth stroke by stroke.
0:52:2|0:52:14|[Huo An] originally wanted to write the three characters for "Little Study Room", but he forgot the correct strokes and had to ask Sima next to him for help. In the blink of an eye, the construction was about to reach the 15-day deadline set by the governor.
0:52:14|0:52:36|Under the city wall, the crowd picked up shovels to mix small bricks, rubble, and sand with water, creating mortar. They filled wooden barrels with the mixture and then used a pulley system with a rope tied around the waist of [Yan Tou] on the high platform, one end attached to the barrel on the ground. With the weight of their bodies, they effortlessly transported the mortar to the top of the city wall.
0:52:41|0:52:58|As the Roman soldiers used iron nails to connect and fix the various iron cages at the damaged section of the city wall, the Nan Di people slowly applied mortar on top. With the setting sun, the original appearance of the city wall finally revealed itself to everyone, with the main hall blocking the sunlight, standing tall and majestic.
0:53:2|0:53:10|The gate tower and arrow tower are intertwined, standing tall and imposing, with smoke rising gracefully from the city walls in all directions, making it difficult to breach.
0:53:11|0:53:17|Outside the city, on the steep mountains, the military road stretches for hundreds of miles, symbolizing the power to dominate the world.
0:53:18|0:53:35|The hearts of the crowd were already overflowing with excitement, as the Roman soldier was the first to embrace the shoulders of the Wusun man and raise his arms high, shouting. The people of the thirty-six nations then surrounded the Han soldier and rushed towards the city corner. [Yan Tou] and [Lao Shu] stood outside the jubilant crowd, gently touching their chests with one hand and bowing their heads in thanks to [Lu Kuisi].
0:53:37|0:53:45|[Huo An] was sitting on top of the high wall at some point, he glanced down and saw [Lu Kuisi], waved at him, and the two smiled at each other.
0:53:48|0:53:59|Next, [Huo An] withdrew his gaze and looked into the distance. As night fell, everyone gathered in front of the military tent and set up a grill.
0:54:7|0:54:26|Inside the military tent, [Yan Tou] sat at the main seat. With a wave of his hand, his men lifted the wine jug and carried it out of the tent. [Lu Kuisi] picked up a grape and brought it close to the young prince's ear, asking if he liked music. Just as he finished speaking, [Huo An] wiped the strong liquor from his lips, then strode to the steps in front of the tent, ready to perform a heroic song.
0:55:37|0:55:43|As soon as the heroic song in the desert ended, Mountain Leopard raised his hand to indicate that he also wanted to sing.
0:55:44|0:55:55|So [Huo An] stepped forward and carefully carried him to the wooden platform in front of Huo Qubing's armor. Originally sitting in the tent, [Lu Kuisi], Hua Gao, and others also smiled and got up to step out of the military tent.
0:55:55|0:56:10|Next, the Little Prince placed his index finger on his lips, waved his arms, and the people standing on the stool followed suit and sat down slowly as instructed. [Huo An] leaned on a wooden platform and sat beside him.
0:58:12|0:58:22|The Roman light soon faded away, just as the lyrics sang, the tearful Roman soldiers believed that the triumphal song would always resound in the city of Rome.
0:58:22|0:58:36|The Little Prince finished singing with a smile, took a step back, and was then lifted around the waist by [Huo An]. Subsequently, [Lao Shu] walked to the edge of the wooden platform, took the Little Prince, and carried him towards the military tent. Watching the direction the Little Prince was leaving, [Huo An] couldn't help but clap and bid farewell.
0:58:39|0:58:51|The crowd soon snapped out of the mournful mood. Although not as fluent in the language of the Romans as [Huo An], the hidden power in the singing made everyone couldn't help but applaud.
0:58:53|0:59:0|Roman soldiers, seeing this scene, also emerged from their sorrow, wiped away the tears on their faces, and applauded vigorously with both hands.
0:59:43|0:59:54|Having poisoned his own younger brother and even patricide by blinding himself with the Queen's potion to seize the throne, [Lu Kuisi] had no choice but to lead his army to escort the young prince eastward.
1:0:10|1:0:23|In order to retrieve the peace agreement signed by Crassus and the Queen, to prove the great betrayal of Prince Tiberius. After saying that, he lowered his head and took a sip of wine, then placed his hands on the steps behind him, raised his head, and looked towards the sky. [Huo An] listened and raised his bowl, speaking.
1:0:37|1:0:51|During an escape, the sister kept crying due to being frightened. In order not to alert the pursuers, [Huo An] desperately covered his sister's mouth with his hands. In this way, Huo An killed his only living relative in the world.
1:0:51|1:1:1|It was at this moment that [Huo An] encountered Huo Qubing who came to rescue him. He was fortunate to be saved in the chaos of battle and remembered the words that would influence his entire life.
1:1:13|1:1:18|Admiring the two's hardship, at this moment, Lu Kuisi's soldiers roared and quickly ran to the two.
1:1:20|1:1:33|The soldier continued, saying that the brothers who had previously gone to the Kingdom of Peace had returned. As [Lu Kuisi] strode into the military tent, he looked up to see his deputy, covered in blood, sitting on a box with tears streaming down his face.
1:1:33|1:1:57|The deputy then recalled that a group of six people were originally rushing towards the direction of the Kingdom of Anxi at full speed. Suddenly, they heard the sound of neighing horses coming from ahead. The group quickly dismounted and climbed up a nearby hill. Below in the valley, they saw neatly arranged infantry and cavalry troops, with the Crown Prince Tibis sitting leisurely on his warhorse, clad in heavy armor.
1:1:59|1:2:12|Huo An expressed concern that Tiberius probably already knew Lu Kuisi's plan. The young prince sitting on the bed heard these words and softly called Lu Kuisi over.
1:2:44|1:2:51|With both hands, [Huo An] gently lifts the head of the Little Prince and plants a tender kiss on his forehead.
1:3:3|1:3:9|If [Huo An] comes to help, then Tiberius will vent his anger on him. The city repaired by everyone in 15 days is just a dream.
1:3:30|1:3:46|Tiberius must be colluding with the governor, and the role of the Protectorate is to maintain peace on the Silk Road. Therefore, [Huo An] plans to return to the Protectorate and borrow troops from his comrade [Yin Po]. This will definitely expose the conspiracy between Tiberius and the governor. As soon as this plan is revealed, it draws a gasp from the young prince.
1:4:1|1:4:11|Huo An was appointed as the leader of the Roman legion. The sudden appointment made Huo An very uneasy, and he immediately turned to look at Lu Kuisi beside him.
1:4:11|1:4:36|Seeing the other party smile at him, he had to turn around again to face the little prince. And as if the little prince could see, in the instant that [Huo An] turned around, he reached out his little hand to signal him to come closer. Then, [Huo An] took a step forward, retreated on one leg, knelt in front of the little prince, and finally, with both palms facing upwards, carefully tucked the Roman short sword into his arms, declaring himself very honored.
1:4:38|1:4:44|With the hopes of everyone, [Huo An] rode towards the Protectorate.
1:4:46|1:5:5|Returning to a few days ago, when [Mountain Leopard] and his group of six discovered the army of one hundred thousand, clad in heavy armor, Tiberius, who was sitting next to the jug on the shoulder of Long, slowly rose from his throne and walked with casual steps to an open space. [Mountain Leopard] and several subordinates of [Lu Kuisi] were kneeling on the ground.
1:5:7|1:5:31|Seeing the people around him being beheaded and falling to the ground, with his turn approaching, [Mountain Leopard] stepped forward like a black panther. He grabbed a soldier by the neck with one hand, snatched the opponent's long sword with the other, and turned to point the sword at Tiberius. Before he could get close, he was pierced through the chest by a sword from the opponent, and the blade, like a mirror, was instantly stained with blood.
1:5:32|1:5:41|Tiberius said nothing, turned around, threw the sword to the soldier who arrived late to protect the carriage, and left without any emotion in his heart.
1:5:42|1:5:50|Silently watching everything, the strategist Agrippa couldn't help but walk up to Tiberius and say, "We have come too far now."
1:6:2|1:6:31|When faced with reprimand, Tiberius not only remained calm inside, but also took the initiative to approach Agricola closely, speaking in a hoarse voice, solemnly stating that everything he had done was destined, as he had a wish since childhood to kill his own biological father. And at the moment when his dream came true, he shared the joy of this with his father.
1:6:31|1:6:36|Outside the heavily guarded Yanmen Pass at this moment.
1:6:40|1:6:50|The Roman soldiers, ready for battle, stood in the desert, and upon hearing this, [Lu Kuisi] quickly returned to the city.
1:6:53|1:6:57|In the grand hall, a group of soldiers wearing black armor and headscarves bowed their heads to [Lu Kuisi].
1:6:58|1:7:12|Before even stepping inside, he noticed Huo An looking uneasy. After a moment of hesitation, he walked towards the center of the hall. Then he saw Lu Kuisi, with a cold gaze, standing beside the young prince.
1:7:16|1:7:26|[Lu Kuisi] felt uneasy without seeing [Huo An], and upon hearing the loud cries of the Little Prince and Hua Gao, he instantly realized that he was already trapped.
1:7:36|1:7:44|In the howling of the Little Prince, [Lu Kuisi] held a short sword, a cold light flashed, and a chill ran through his hand.
1:7:56|1:8:6|Ma Chuang saw the situation turning bad, shot an arrow into Lu Kuisi's left knee. Seeing him break off half of his sword and still mounting his horse, Ma Chuang quickly circled behind Lu Kuisi and thrust a sword into his back chest.
1:8:8|1:8:14|The ambush succeeded, [Lu Kuisi] knelt on the ground in embarrassment. Originally hesitant, a soldier with a short knife took advantage of his unpreparedness and kicked him in the back.
1:8:22|1:8:41|The crying sound that the little prince asked him to leave was endless, but [Lu Kuisi] turned a deaf ear, trembling his arms, propping up his body, and constantly moving forward. Seeing this, [Huo An] seemed to be caught up in the fun as well. As soon as [Lu Kuisi] stood up, he used the scabbard to strike the opponent's face heavily.
1:8:41|1:8:49|The force was so great that it directly flipped him over. The scene then shifts to a small study in the city.
1:8:58|1:9:13|[Huo An], who arrived just in time, grabbed the collar of the soldier and threw him aside, then took away the long sword and knocked out the soldier pressing down on [Xiu Qing]. The commotion of the fight quickly caught the attention of other soldiers in the alley.
1:9:13|1:9:21|[Huo An] raised his knife to meet the enemy, quickly repelling the soldiers who came to reinforce, and then protected [Xiu Qing] behind him.
1:9:23|1:9:47|At this moment, as the soldier hiding beside the haystack raised his sword to strike, he was met with an arrow coming straight at him. On the rooftop, [Leng Yue] lowered her bow and glanced sideways. Not far away, soldiers kept pouring out in a steady stream from the city gate tunnel. [Huo An] made a quick decision and instructed [Xiu Qing] to look after the children.
1:9:47|1:9:54|[Leng Yue] also quickly took [Hong Ri] into the small study to hide. When the soldiers pushed open the door outside, they shot cold arrows through the window.
1:10:13|1:10:18|[Leng Yue] may hit the target every time, but unfortunately, there are too many people outside the house.
1:10:24|1:10:40|Huo An hurriedly urged Xiu Qing and the children to escape to the second floor upon discovering that the soldiers were about to press in at the door. He then quickly surveyed the situation inside the house. Upon seeing a half-height window, he immediately pushed it open and tightly tied one end of a long vine hanging inside the house, throwing the other end down from the window.
1:10:42|1:10:50|Leng Yue pulled back her longbow and crouched at the staircase on the second floor. Any soldier who showed their head would be shot dead.
1:10:51|1:11:3|At this moment, [Huo An] climbed out of the window, grabbed the long vine, and quickly descended to the backyard of the small study. Once he stood firm, he hurriedly wrapped the vine around his waist, then with a big hand gesture, a slide made of cloth appeared in front of him.
1:11:4|1:11:13|[Xiu Qing] quickly lined up the children one by one, helped them onto the long vine, and carefully slid them down.
1:11:23|1:11:29|The pursuers had already poured into the staircase. [Leng Yue], sensing the danger, quickly pushed over a bookshelf towards them.
1:11:34|1:11:46|Huo An then flipped over and leaped back, jumping into the long vine, and swiftly shot an arrow to block the pursuer's throat. He then dropped the long vine and ran towards the alley.
1:11:50|1:12:1|Seeing [Huo An] and the others changing direction and passing through the wine workshop, the soldiers hurried to catch up. The leader had just stepped over the threshold when he was met with an arrow, as [Hong Ri] had been waiting here quietly for a long time.
1:12:3|1:12:12|The enraged soldiers were about to continue their pursuit. Inside the wine shop, [Hong Ri]'s men quickly pressed against the door, shooting cold arrows directly at the enemy's faces.
1:12:13|1:12:22|At this moment, [Huo An] led everyone to turn into the center of the market. After meeting up with [Leng Yue], [Hong Ri] stood at the front of the group, aiming towards the alley.
1:12:23|1:12:27|The soldiers had just stepped in when they were pierced in the throat by arrows flying towards them.
1:12:39|1:12:59|[Huo An] saw the intense battle here and quickly instructed the children to follow [Xiu Qing] and leave first. By this time, the archers had already closed in, and amidst the chaos of arrows, they successfully shot through the chest of [Hong Ri]'s men. Witnessing this, [Hong Ri] immediately turned around, pulled his bow, and after releasing an arrow, it went straight through a bamboo pole and nailed the soldiers.
1:13:4|1:13:18|Seeing [Huo An] pick up a wooden board and hold it in front of [Leng Yue] and himself, [Hong Ri] shouted to hurry. Unfortunately, a Nan Di child dropped his book on the ground while escaping, and [Xiu Qing] watched him turn around to pick it up, disregarding the danger to chase after the alliance.
1:13:21|1:13:45|[Xiu Qing] actually used her body to shield the child, with two long arrows piercing straight into the back of her neck and back. [Huo An] was shocked and quickly stood up a wooden board to shield himself, then went behind the two of them. With one hand, he helped [Xiu Qing] up and slowly moved towards the end of the alley, but in an instant, the wooden board was filled with long swords, and some arrowheads even directly pierced into [Huo An]'s shoulder.
1:13:45|1:13:50|Finally, the three of them moved slowly into the blind spot of the soldiers' vision.
1:13:51|1:13:59|[Huo An] quickly pushed the child aside. On the other side, to save [Hong Ri], he used his back as a shield in front of him.
1:14:0|1:14:7|With a gritted teeth, he bid farewell to his brother. [Hong Ri] swiftly unsheathed his long sword and shot angrily with his bow.
1:14:9|1:14:20|[Huo An] saw a group of people in trouble, quickly rushed to the edge of the alley, pulled a cart filled with straw, dodged the whizzing cold arrows, and then used a shovel to lift the blazing charcoal fire on the side of the road.
1:14:21|1:14:29|Chunks of charcoal scattered in the air, instantly igniting flames and crashing down on the soldiers outside the cart.
1:14:30|1:14:42|Continuing, he picked up two wine bottles and threw them into the air. Without saying a word, [Hong Ri] already knew [Huo An]'s plan, and he pierced the bottles with two consecutive arrows. In an instant, the cart in front of everyone was engulfed in flames.
1:14:43|1:15:8|Taking advantage of this opportunity, [Huo An] turned around and picked up the already fainted [Xiu Qing] horizontally, then hurried out of the market. In the desert, with her chest stained black with blood, [Xiu Qing] lay on the ground with cold sweat seeping through her dark hair. Ignoring the pain, she gently held [Huo An]'s hand and spoke.
1:15:11|1:15:29|[Xiu Qing] couldn't help but touch [Huo An]'s cheek with her delicate hand covered in gray gauze. Her eyes seemed to be soaked in dew, shining brightly.
1:15:32|1:15:46|Before he could finish the three words, [Xiu Qing]'s hand slid from [Huo An]'s cheek to his chest, and finally, weakly rested on his arm. Looking at [Xiu Qing] with a smile on her lips and her eyes closed.
1:15:46|1:16:2|[Huo An] stood with his hands hanging in front of him, tears streaming down his face. Inside the ancient city of Loulan, [Lu Kuisi] had his feet against a heavy lock, his legs bent and suspended on an iron frame. The only thing keeping him upright were the thick iron chains wrapped around his arms like wristbands.
1:16:4|1:16:21|Under heavy guard, soldiers patrolled outside the prison cell. At this moment, [Tiberius] stood leisurely in front of the cell door, and as the four soldiers pushed open the door together, he stepped inside. The soldiers outside quickly turned the gears connecting the iron chains.
1:16:21|1:16:36|[Lu Kuisi] was gradually lifted into the air, looking at [Lu Kuisi] with a face full of pain, [Tiberius] smiled and said, "Welcome home," expressing his long-awaited anticipation for this scene.
1:17:21|1:17:36|When it comes to the source of the uprising, [Tiberius] bluntly stated that he had actually colluded with [Huo An]'s subordinate [Yin Po] long ago. As soon as a hundred thousand elite soldiers arrive at the border of the Han Dynasty, [Yin Po] will hand over all the border defense seals and military tokens.
1:17:37|1:17:45|By then, the entire Silk Road will be under the control of the Roman Empire, at the cost of everything they possess.
1:18:9|1:18:18|After all, a child without any weapons poses no threat. [Lu Kuisi] looked down at this and murmured softly.
1:18:42|1:18:57|Continuing, Huo An recalled the scene on the pillar platform, where the wind and sand carried the setting sun, blowing onto the damaged pillar platform. Huo An led a part of the elite team, constantly approaching the flower high ground where the prince was being held back.
1:19:19|1:19:32|At this moment, with no way out, Huo Gao, seeing Lu Kuisi signaling him to jump off the pillar, closed his eyes tightly, took a deep breath, hugged the little prince, and fell backwards.
1:19:34|1:19:40|Thus, the two fell into an endless abyss. Upon learning that the Little Prince had been driven to a dead end, [Lu Kuisi] gritted his teeth.
1:19:44|1:19:48|The air seemed to have frozen into sharp ice chips, while [Lu Kuisi] strolled nonchalantly on the execution platform.
1:19:50|1:20:11|After a while, it was announced that the Little Prince had died, so there was no more conflict between [Lu Kuisi]. After saying that, Tiberius walked back to [Lu Kuisi] and whispered in his ear that he had a secret to tell - recently, when looking in the mirror, he found the reflection to be extremely similar to [Lu Kuisi].
1:20:14|1:20:21|As soon as the words fell, [Lu Kuisi] suddenly grabbed the iron chain and struck Tiberius directly in the face.
1:20:30|1:20:39|Otherwise everything becomes dull and boring. After speaking, he drew out a short knife from his side and used the tip of the knife to outline the face of [Lu Kuisi], his gaze fierce.
1:20:42|1:21:1|Huo An, who arrived late, was squatting inside Yanmen Pass, looking at the Roman legion flag being trampled on the ground, lost in thought. Yan Tou led a group of soldiers standing in front of the city gate, apologizing to him in a low voice.
1:21:4|1:21:15|[Lao Shu] hesitated for a moment, then followed suit. Soon after, [Huo An] saw the two of them pushing and shoving, so he squinted his eyes and spoke.
1:21:20|1:21:31|At that time, the deputy of Tiberius, holding a short sword, stood in front of the gate of Yanmen Pass and said that in the future, the countries along the Silk Road would be reorganized by the Roman Empire.
1:21:39|1:21:44|Tiberius raised his eyes and looked at the Bai Rong chieftain who was pressed in front of him.
1:22:7|1:22:15|The unreasonable demand angered [Leng Yue]. At that moment, [Huo An] and his group were surrounded by the 36 tribes in the city holding sticks.
1:22:38|1:22:47|When the Southern Di, Wusun, and Turks had vented their anger, the previously silent [Kucha] cleared his throat and spoke loudly, saying that he had been ordered around his whole life, and now it was time for him to make a choice.
1:22:50|1:22:57|The man's shout quickly resonated with others, who angrily demanded [Yan Tou] to hand over [Huo An].
1:22:58|1:23:20|[Huo An] saw the situation, his face calm, and looked up towards [Yan Tou]. Holding the legion flag, [Huo An] glanced around at the crowd wielding sticks.
1:23:21|1:23:30|He gritted his teeth, his gaze firm. [Leng Yue] put down the knife in astonishment and walked up to [Huo An].
1:24:0|1:24:16|[Leng Yue] was startled and quickly followed [Huo An], who said as soon as she approached. At this moment, [Huo An] walked towards the armor of [Huo Qubing].
1:24:54|1:24:58|The tribe that was originally dancing with knives and guns loosened their weapons after listening.
1:25:10|1:25:27|[Huo An] spoke to this point, tears welling up in his eyes. His heartfelt words unexpectedly moved everyone to tears along with [Huo An]. Then, [Huo An] sniffed, and a smile appeared on his face as he surveyed the faces of the crowd.
1:25:51|1:26:9|A tear rolled down Huo An's cheek as he looked up at the sky with deep affection in his eyes.
1:26:11|1:26:17|[Leng Yue] looked at [Huo An], who was already in tears, and lowered her head.
1:26:21|1:26:28|Suddenly hearing [Huo An] speaking as if he were making final arrangements, [Leng Yue] couldn't help but tremble all over.
1:26:29|1:26:46|Upon the armor of Huo Qubing, the flags of the thirty-six nations stood on both sides, slowly being hoisted up into the sky with hemp ropes. After witnessing this scene with his own eyes, [Huo An] was then handcuffed by [Yan Tou] and [Lao Shu], and they walked towards the direction of the ancient city of Loulan.
1:26:46|1:26:59|A small team quickly crossed the desert and, led by Vice General Tibis, headed towards the ancient city. At this moment, [Lao Shu] and [Yan Tou] reminisced.
1:27:30|1:27:45|[Huo An], based on the information provided by the informant [Lao Shu], guessed that [Lu Kuisi] must be imprisoned in the cell. Without knowing the intentions of the three, Vice Commander Tiberius immediately led them through a heavy gate at the end of the small path.
1:27:45|1:27:57|All of [Lu Kuisi]'s subordinates, who were all locked in iron cages, saw [Huo An] leaning against the handcuffs. They angrily grabbed the iron cages tightly, and the copper locks on the cages made clanging sounds under the pressure.
1:27:59|1:28:4|[Huo An], who couldn't stay long, was quickly pushed onto the main street and arrived inside the grand hall.
1:28:5|1:28:9|Sitting on the throne, Tiberius looked at a furious [Huo An] and smiled.
1:28:47|1:28:54|[Yan Tou] and [Lao Shu] quickly pretended to step forward and hold him, and at the sight of Tiberius sitting up straight in an instant, [Huo An] whispered in doubt.
1:28:56|1:29:4|Will [Yin Po] really give up the Silk Road for a position as a prefecture governor? Just as Tiberius questioned [Yin Po] if there was a problem,
1:29:17|1:29:26|Tiberius' face turned cold instantly, [Huo An] took a breath without showing any signs, glanced sideways and met eyes with [Yan Tou] beside him.
1:29:28|1:29:50|Outside the city, [Yin Po] looked at the dark army and quickly stopped. The centurion beside him took out a seal about the length of a forearm from a wooden box, but [Yin Po] ignored it and signaled for Ma Chong to follow as they rode forward. In the midst of the army, [Lao Shu] quietly asked.
1:30:10|1:30:16|[Yan Tou] pushed [Huo An] into the iron cage, then clapped his hands and walked up to the deputy general, demanding the agreed-upon gold coins.
1:30:30|1:30:40|Yan Tou immediately removed Huo An's handcuffs. At this moment, Yin Po dismounted and, along with Ma Chao and the other six, strolled up to Tiberius, then extended his hands and smiled as he spoke.
1:30:50|1:30:57|Then he also followed the agreement and exchanged with the border pass, but unexpectedly, Tiberius mentioned [Huo An].
1:31:2|1:31:18|At this moment, [Huo An] was squatting in the center of the iron cage. After quietly sharing his plan, he instructed the soldiers to spread out and guard the railings of the cage. With the collective effort of everyone, the iron cage was lifted up more than two inches. The shaking sound alarmed the nearby soldiers on guard.
1:31:20|1:31:30|With the force of [Huo An], the subordinates of [Lu Kuisi] leaned their shoulders and rammed the other end of the iron cage. In an instant, the cage tilted and fell into a passageway over three meters high.
1:31:32|1:31:45|The sturdy railing broke apart, and as he walked to the end, a soldier in another cell saw this and shouted excitedly, "[Huo An], quickly throw the key to the copper lock over here."
1:31:46|1:31:54|As the soldiers reached out of the iron cage to unlock it from the outside, a wave of guards descended the steps with short swords in hand.
1:32:2|1:32:10|The soldier beside him pulled open the bronze lock, used his body to collide with the blade and burst out through the gate. Huo An saw the signal arrow and gestured to the people around him.
1:32:12|1:32:17|In the midst of the troops, [Huo An]'s subordinate pulled his longbow taut, and an arrow pierced straight into the throat of a Tiberian cavalryman.
1:32:25|1:32:31|Tiberius noticed the situation not far away and turned to look at the counselor [Agrippa].
1:32:48|1:33:10|As long as [Yin Po] is killed, the position of the Protectorate Prefect will belong to him. Upon seeing this, [Yin Po] quickly grasped the hilt of the knife. Then the two exchanged glances, silently and tacitly, and simultaneously drew their knives to attack Tiberius. Before they could even approach, Machao was met with a long sword straight to his forehead. After his neck was slashed, he breathed his last breath.
1:33:10|1:33:27|Accompanied by soldiers rushing towards him, only [Yin Po] was left in the blink of an eye. Enraged, he raised his long sword and swung it towards Tiberius, but the latter dodged, delivering a strike and a sweep, causing blood to gush from [Yin Po]'s back and thigh in an instant.
1:33:27|1:33:45|But [Yin Po] still refused to give up, raising his sword once again towards Tiberius. In the blink of an eye, his right wrist holding the sword was chopped off. Paralyzed by the pain, [Yin Po] froze in place, allowing Tiberius to move around to his back. Then, swinging his long sword, Tiberius forcefully pierced through his chest.
1:33:45|1:33:54|Licking the fresh blood on his hands, [Huo An] led a group of Roman soldiers and guards into a melee in the city of Loulan.
1:33:56|1:34:12|After snatching a long sword that came attacking, [Huo An] dodged his body and quickly headed towards the prison where [Lu Kuisi] was held. Soon, he arrived at the platform, put on his protective gear, and quickly took care of two guards with just a few moves.
1:34:13|1:34:18|At this moment, the guards outside the city quickly reported to Tiberius that there was a big disturbance in the prison inside the city.
1:34:20|1:34:36|Tiberius muttered to himself that it must be [Huo An] causing trouble, so he quickly pointed angrily at his subordinates with the tip of his sword and ordered reinforcements to be sent immediately. Then he sheathed his sword, leaned against the throne behind him, and looked coldly at the fighting crowd on the battlefield, giving a faint smile.
1:34:36|1:34:51|Within the ancient city, [Huo An] finally finished clearing the guards in front of him, and with the help of the Roman soldier, he pushed open the prison gate. The Roman soldier saw another iron gate in front of [Lu Kuisi], so he hurried back outside the cell and struggled to turn the gears.
1:34:54|1:35:6|[Huo An] took the opportunity to pick up a knife from the weapon rack next to the door. After the iron gate rose, he continuously used it to cut the iron chain on [Lu Kuisi]'s forearm, trying to rescue him.
1:35:16|1:35:29|[Lu Kuisi]'s eyes were gouged out, under his sword-like eyebrows, his face almost covered in blood. He then shook his disheveled and damp hair, opened his hand hanging on the iron chain, signaling [Huo An] to shake hands with him.
1:35:32|1:35:37|[Huo An] had just knelt down when he heard [Lu Kuisi] asking, "This is a Roman family matter, why get involved?"
1:35:38|1:35:45|Frantically hacking at the iron chains, [Huo An] gasped that it was his duty.
1:36:13|1:36:18|Everyone who guards this city with him will be his eternal friends.
1:36:21|1:36:41|Unexpectedly, as soon as the words fell, the guards lying in ambush at the top lifted a barrel and splashed it towards the cell, hanging on the wall, onto the burning torches. [Huo An] staggered back repeatedly, and when he looked up, he saw that the fire around [Lu Kuisi] at the waist had already surrounded him. So he immediately took off his robe and hurriedly threw it towards the flames in front of him.
1:36:59|1:37:5|Otherwise, [Huo An] and the Roman legion will both be buried here.
1:37:6|1:37:15|Huo An took a half step back at Lu Kuisi's heart-wrenching cry, picked up the Roman short sword and Lu Kuisi's headband that had fallen at his feet.
1:37:16|1:37:30|[Huo An], who was about to run out of the cell, heard the trembling voice and instantly understood what was happening. He slowly turned around, looked towards the weapon rack by the door, took a few deep breaths, and then walked towards it.
1:37:31|1:37:38|After a moment of contemplation, he raised his hand and picked up a crossbow from the rack, then aimed the arrow straight at [Lu Kuisi] with difficulty.
1:37:43|1:37:52|Upon hearing [Lu Kuisi] pleading for him to go home, [Huo An], who was originally firm, instantly closed his eyes and bowed his head.
1:37:53|1:38:2|As he raised his head again, tears were already in his eyes. Then, he stared at [Lu Kuisi] with trembling lips and spoke.
1:38:3|1:38:10|As soon as the words fell, [Huo An] gritted his teeth and pulled the trigger, the short arrow cutting through the rolling heat wave, heading straight towards [Lu Kuisi].
1:38:11|1:38:28|At that moment, [Lu Kuisi] seemed to be transported back to the magnificent and enchanting palaces of Rome. Seeing [Lu Kuisi] with an arrow piercing his throat, yet smiling and closing his eyes, [Huo An] picked up his headband and tied it around his forehead before turning away.
1:38:29|1:38:48|Outside the prison gate, the sound of footsteps was heard, getting closer and closer. It turned out that in the alley, two rows of guards were running in an orderly manner, holding shields and crossbows. Roman soldiers and Yan Tou's men quickly crouched at the top of the steps, holding swords in their hands to stay alert.
1:38:48|1:39:6|However, with a command from the guard, the hidden cold arrow shooters simultaneously released their arrows from behind the long shields. Four Roman soldiers were instantly hit, lost their balance, and tumbled down the steps. Seeing this, the guards immediately formed a long line, shielding the soldiers in front of them, then picked up long spears and thrust them wildly at the enemy's chests.
1:39:12|1:39:35|After roughly stopping the bleeding, he suddenly noticed the scattered rocks at his feet. The soldiers also quickly came to their senses, frantically flipping over the scattered rocks around them, and vigorously smashing them towards the guards below the steps. The guards, who were originally holding long shields and advancing in a row, were knocked askew and twisted by the impact.
1:39:37|1:39:52|It seems that this move can break the Dunjia formation. [Huo An] shouted loudly for everyone to pick up larger stones. Watching the guards still advancing with their shields raised, the Roman soldiers, along with [Huo An], finally pushed down the large stone block that was four people wide and one person long.
1:39:53|1:39:59|[Yan Tou]'s men also showed no weakness, lifting a stone pillar together and smashing it towards the guards once again.
1:40:4|1:40:16|In front of the Dunjia formation, a large opening was finally torn open by a giant stone, and [Huo An] quickly led the others to charge down. However, after taking the guard's long sword, [Huo An] found it difficult to bring himself to kill.
1:40:19|1:40:28|But just as they let the other party go, they were ambushed by another group of people, and a long spear pierced their abdomen. The Roman soldiers were also unwilling to engage in combat with their compatriots, only angrily ordering the other side to leave.
1:40:34|1:40:39|Seeing the guards fleeing in all directions, the group wasted no time and urged each other to leave the place quickly.
1:40:42|1:40:48|Just as they turned into a narrow alley, the soldiers caught sight of the guards in heavy armor, armed with short arrows, converging from the east and north.
1:41:3|1:41:17|Roman soldiers listened to this. Shouting in a hoarse voice, they called out. Then, they rallied and ordered to line up for battle. [Huo An], along with [Yan Tou] and the Roman soldiers under his command, immediately raised their long shields and charged straight at the three-sided defense.
1:41:17|1:41:23|Suddenly, [Huo An] caught sight of the large scattered rocks beside him, and he recalled the scene of the Romans cleverly using their long shields while building the city at Yanmen Pass.
1:41:29|1:41:33|Under his command, the team quickly formed a spear-shaped charging formation.
1:41:34|1:41:41|In front, the Long Spear Army pierced through the shields, while behind them stood giant stones on top of double shields, with a few armored soldiers on both sides.
1:41:42|1:41:45|The group worked together to push the giant stone array forward bravely.
1:41:52|1:41:59|Unexpectedly, as soon as the city gate opened, [Huo An] and the others looked up to see the guards at the rear of Tiberius glaring at them.
1:42:0|1:42:17|The long spear pointed directly at this small team, so [Huo An] quickly led everyone to climb up the nearby low hill. Unfortunately, they were already discovered by the strategist Agrippa. Leading the group to the mountaintop, the soldiers looked at the hundred thousand strong army waiting in front of them, instantly falling into despair.
1:42:28|1:42:45|But [Huo An] had already burned his bridges and shouted, "If you're brothers, then die together." Looking at the almost reckless [Huo An] and his companions, Tiberius, with a demonic look on his face, even managed a slight smile. Suddenly, a disturbance in the sky caught his attention.
1:42:45|1:43:8|Looking back, a dark mass of eagles that seemed to fill the sky was rushing towards the army of one hundred thousand. Even though the guards held long shields and short swords, they were still no match for the raptors swooping down from high above. From the sky to the battlefield, they pierced through the air above people's heads in a matter of seconds, then greedily snatched at the guards' eyeballs.
1:43:8|1:43:20|Tiberius, feeling uneasy, quickly looked into the distance. At some point, on the towering mountain to the north, a mix of flying sand and countless cavalry appeared.
1:43:21|1:43:28|Looking towards the west, the white chief with a round hat led the cavalry with wolf tooth clubs just crossing over the mountain top.
1:43:29|1:43:48|At this moment, the Turkic cavalry with long scarves rushed in from the south, while a large number of soldiers from Kucha surged in from the east. Before long, troops from the Thirty-Six Kingdoms gathered from all directions. Even [Huo An] was stunned by the sight.
1:43:49|1:44:11|The first to arrive were the Xiongnu people, who began beating the drums of attack. [Leng Yue] took the lead, rushing down from the mountain with a long bow and a sharp sword on his back. Chief Bairong also refused to fall behind, playing the solemn war zither with his soldiers and brandishing his scimitar, aiming directly at the 100,000 troops of Tiberius. The Nan Di people then sounded the bronze drums and galloped down from the mountain.
1:44:15|1:44:19|The people of Kucha blew the long horns at this time, their footsteps filling the sky, heads held high as they pushed forward with all their might.
1:44:20|1:44:27|Following closely behind, the Wusun people raised heavy hammers and struck the bronze gongs, and in an instant, the cavalry whipped their horses and charged straight down.
1:44:28|1:44:37|The Turks were orderly beating the drums made of oxhide behind the formation, and the soldiers rode their horses to the drumbeats, rushing down the hill like arrows released from a bow.
1:44:39|1:44:46|The army of Tiberius, with a hundred thousand soldiers, had eagles circling above their heads, surrounded on all sides by enemies.
1:44:48|1:44:57|At this moment, [Hong Ri] rode up to [Leng Yue] and shouted for her to go rescue [Huo An]. After speaking, he led a large group of soldiers straight towards the direction of the hundred thousand army.
1:44:59|1:45:5|Seeing the army about to be surrounded by the coalition forces of the Thirty-Six Nations, Tiberius spread his arms and shouted for battle.
1:45:7|1:45:24|Accompanied by the thunderous and rhythmic war drums, the cavalry on the outermost edge of the army swiftly changed direction and charged towards the four corners of the compass. However, it was still difficult to resist the long-planned murderous intent of the coalition forces.
1:45:24|1:45:32|[Hong Ri] and his men rode through the ranks, their hands rising and falling with their swords, quickly splitting the guard's shield in half.
1:45:35|1:45:52|The Huns dismounted and approached the infantry formation, swinging the sling with a stone towards the enemy. The raised dust made the guards squint their eyes, so the Huns covered their mouths and noses with long scarves. Then, they raised their long knives and charged into the formation.
1:45:53|1:46:11|Seeing the effectiveness of the attack, the Wusun people also launched a counterattack using the same tactics. Where the stones fell, the guards were all knocked unconscious and fell to the ground. On the other side, Huo An and his group had to retreat from the top of the low hill, while the guards were constantly fighting their way up from the foot of the mountain.
1:46:11|1:46:26|At the critical moment, [Leng Yue] shot a cold arrow from behind the guard, attracting the opponent's attention. Then, leading the team on horseback, charged towards the guard holding a long shield and spear. The neatly arranged formation was instantly scattered.
1:46:27|1:46:36|The guards abandoned their horses and scattered. [Huo An] quickly signaled everyone to retreat down the mountain, then he moved over to [Leng Yue].
1:46:44|1:46:51|Watching [Huo An] holding his abdomen and staunching the bleeding in pain, [Leng Yue] sat upright on the horse, staring with watery eyes, showing a firm stance.
1:46:55|1:46:59|Finally, Tiberius was annoyed by the chaotic offensive in front of him, then he raised his long sword and roared to attack.
1:47:0|1:47:13|The brightly armored guard, not only beat the drums this time, but also had six men blowing the long horns. The guards, who had been repeatedly frustrated, seemed to have undergone a transformation at this moment, killing several soldiers of the coalition army in succession in the chaotic battle.
1:47:13|1:47:35|The long spear with a cold light pierced into the soldiers' chests and abdomens, spraying blood into the desert, soon to be buried by the flying sand. The leaders of Kucha and Wusun were also surrounded by guards in the chaos, their hearts pierced by random spears. The skilled [Lao Shu] was ambushed, with a sword piercing straight through his lower abdomen.
1:47:35|1:47:41|[Yan Tou], who fought fiercely, was accidentally pushed down by a guard and then stabbed in the side by someone.
1:47:58|1:48:16|Upon another glance, [Huo An] saw the two of them spitting blood, both collapsing at the foot of the mountain. The Chanyu [Yin Po], who had been struck three times in the elbow, back, and leg, also knelt straight down on the ground. The belated [Hong Ri] could only watch helplessly as the guard chopped off his head.
1:48:16|1:48:23|[Red Sun], driven to a frenzy, was directly cut open by the guard with a knife.
1:48:24|1:48:46|At this moment, a falcon let out a long cry, its talons aiming straight for the guard's eyes. Sensing the danger, [Hong Ri] quickly got up and made a sword strike to the throat. However, outnumbered, [Hong Ri] soon found himself surrounded by guards armed with shields and swords. Quickly, they crowded around him with their shields, gradually piercing through the gaps and into [Hong Ri]'s chest and abdomen.
1:48:48|1:48:56|As Tiberius approached with his sword, the crowd dispersed and released [Hong Ri]. Then, they saw him covered in blood, still pointing his sword at Tiberius.
1:48:59|1:49:6|But he was covered in wounds and fell sideways. Tiberius smirked, enjoying his miserable death.
1:49:8|1:49:23|Suddenly, the swirling sand in the distance caught his attention. Under the setting sun, a large army with pointed hats and swift horses, carrying fluttering banners, approached. As they drew closer, Huo An finally realized that these were the troops of the Kingdom of Anxi.
1:49:24|1:49:31|Upon hearing the enemy blowing the horn, the strategist Agrippa immediately ordered a retreat.
1:49:32|1:49:43|The guards who were originally fighting fiercely with [Huo An] and others quietly put down their long spears and began to retreat backwards. Before long, the troops from the [Huo An] kingdom had already arrived at the battlefield with their heads held high.
1:49:44|1:49:52|The counselor Agri, who was originally standing beside the throne and directing the guards to beat the war drums, suddenly flashed a look in his eyes and hurried towards Tibis in front of him.
1:49:55|1:50:2|Tiberius, on the other hand, was staring intently at the [Queen of the Parthian Empire] not far away, her face mostly covered by a veil and adorned in magnificent attire.
1:50:5|1:50:23|At this moment, the knight beside the queen suddenly roared in anger. It was Lu Kuisi, who killed the war god Klarus. It was also him who blinded his own younger brother Pris. Sensing the suspicious glances from his subordinates, Lu Kuisi retorted that this was purely nonsense.
1:50:43|1:50:52|While the Empress was speaking, the attendants beside her also raised the mutual assistance agreement above their heads, showing it to everyone.
1:50:52|1:51:11|At this moment, Tiberius heard the questioning from [Queen of the Huns], asking how it felt to personally kill his father and brother. He seemed to be transported back to the chamber where he poisoned the young prince. As he lowered his eyes and breathed rapidly, the counselor Agrippa appeared by his side, softly persuading him.
1:51:11|1:51:21|Now it's not too late to turn back. He then reached out his left hand, asking for the long sword. Tibis gently grasped his own blood-stained hand.
1:51:24|1:51:32|The next moment, he unexpectedly pierced Agrigento's abdomen with an arrow, then lowered his head and whispered softly in the opponent's ear,
1:51:34|1:51:42|A true hero never looks back. After saying this, Huo An released his grip, and Agrippa widened his eyes and fell to the side.
1:51:48|1:51:59|He straightened his back and glared around angrily, declaring that it was time to settle things. However, neither the guards nor the soldiers of the Anxi Kingdom dared to step forward to confront him.
1:52:0|1:52:6|Before Tiberius could utter his mocking words, his gaze suddenly shifted straight ahead.
1:52:7|1:52:25|It turned out to be [Huo An] limping out from the crowd with a short sword, as he approached, Tiberius stepped forward and said, "If there was any miscalculation in this power struggle, it was underestimating the role [Huo An] played in it."
1:52:28|1:52:43|But [Huo An] disagreed, believing that Tiberius underestimated human nature. When asked why he stood up, [Huo An] simply stated that it was for his friend Lu Kuisi. Tiberius sneered at this, mocking him.
1:53:9|1:53:23|In response to this, causing everyone to cheer, Huo An took the opportunity to declare, "Then let us settle our differences between us, I will definitely give [Huo An] a Roman funeral." As soon as he finished speaking, [Huo An] raised his sword and charged straight towards Lu Kuisi's face.
1:53:23|1:53:45|However, Tiberius moved faster, dodging and delivering a fierce blow with his long sword that forced [Huo An] to retreat five steps. Then, he mounted his horse and with lightning-like strikes, aimed directly at [Huo An]'s waist and arms, but each strike was blocked. Tiberius leaped into the air and landed a heavy blow towards [Huo An]'s face.
1:53:45|1:53:56|Huo An quickly raised the short sword over his head to protect his body, but was knocked down to the ground by the force. When he struggled to get up, the hand holding the sword was trembling uncontrollably.
1:53:57|1:54:10|Tiberius pointed his long sword with interest at the wrist of [Huo An], then swiftly moved towards him like a fleeting shadow, their blades clashing once again before he kicked his injured thigh.
1:54:11|1:54:21|Seeing that [Huo An] still did not give up, Tiberius swung his arm and turned to attack him. The air stirred by the long sword seemed to be able to hang a person's head.
1:54:24|1:54:38|Huo An, with injuries on his body, felt his arm sore as he kept retreating, losing his weapon, and then getting a sword slash across his chest armor, falling backward. Bright blood quickly seeped out from the torn fabric on his chest.
1:54:39|1:54:54|Tiberius, on the other hand, found amusement in picking up the fallen short sword with his long sword. He walked over to [Huo An], bent down, and handed it to him. Upon receiving the short sword, [Huo An] gripped the handle and without getting up, immediately swung it towards Tiberius.
1:54:54|1:55:4|After being easily dodged by him, [Huo An] staggered to his feet. He had barely made a few cuts when the sword in his hand was knocked away by Tibesus.
1:55:5|1:55:14|[Huo An], without weapons, could only raise his left arm and use his armor to block Tiberius's attacks that felt as heavy as a thousand pounds.
1:55:14|1:55:30|Finally, Tiberius was angered by a loud roar from [Huo An], who first cut off his armor with a sword, then swung an elbow towards his face, and finally kicked angrily at his chest. Despite falling heavily on his back, [Huo An] still tried to get up.
1:55:30|1:55:44|But soon he was lying on the ground again. At this moment, [Tiberius] came to [Huo An]'s side, squatted down, slowly lifted his face with a sword, and whispered, "Wearing [Lu Kuisi]'s headband is simply a bad omen."
1:55:48|1:56:1|While [Huo An] took the opportunity to reach behind his waist with his right hand, drew out a dagger and turned to stab [Lu Kuisi]. Unexpectedly, Lu Kuisi saw through it at a glance, then he grabbed [Huo An]'s neck and lifted him up alive.
1:56:1|1:56:21|Another hand grabbed [Huo An]'s wrist, changed direction, and the dagger stabbed straight into [Huo An]'s waist. Looking at the painful [Huo An], [Tiberius] raised his hand, pulled off [Lu Kuisi]'s headband, and threw it aside. Then, with a gentle push of his right hand, [Huo An] fell down limp.
1:56:21|1:56:24|Anxious [Leng Yue] stared with wide eyes as [Huo An] slowly crawled towards the headband.
1:56:32|1:56:43|Amidst the shouts of everyone, [Huo An] stretched out his arms and struggled to move his body, finally touching [Lu Kuisi]'s headband with his fingertips.
1:56:43|1:56:57|Disdainful [Tiberius] took a step forward, grabbed [Huo An]'s collar, making him kneel on the ground. While declaring the end of the battle, he extended his foot towards [Huo An]'s chin, slowly applying pressure to straighten his kneeling body.
1:57:4|1:57:14|Just as Tiberius raised his long sword, ready to execute the beheading, the distorted roar of [Lu Kuisi] in the cell awakened [Huo An].
1:57:16|1:57:21|Next, he used his fist gripping the trigger to strike Tibis's small elbow.
1:57:22|1:57:37|Before he could react, Tiberius had his armor on the left wrist, broken in half by [Huo An], and his neck scratched. Then [Huo An] bent down, arms around Tiberius' waist, and charged towards the guard like a madman.
1:57:38|1:57:49|Tiberius, who hit the long shield hard, raised his hand to ask for help from the guards, but to his surprise, everyone dodged him, leaving him spitting blood and looking puzzled at the front.
1:57:50|1:58:10|Queen of the Kingdom of Anxi then revealed the truth, that power often exposes people's greatest weaknesses. Looking at the sun setting in the east, Tiberius recalled his spirited appearance when he set out for battle, and he firmly believed that a true hero never looks back.
1:58:13|1:58:20|Continuing, he gritted his teeth against the pain shooting up from his neck, bent down, and slowly pulled up [Huo An] in front of him.
1:58:21|1:58:35|With a swift and decisive motion, the dagger that was stabbed into the side was pulled out, and then placed between the chests of the two, the sound of the blade piercing flesh instantly widened [Huo An]'s eyes.
1:58:36|1:58:57|Then, he turned his head and looked straight at Tiberius, who unexpectedly fell straight back with a dagger stuck in his heart. For a moment, no one could see clearly who was responsible for the dagger in his chest. And [Huo An], after Tiberius fell, knelt down slowly, gasping for breath.
1:59:43|1:59:51|At this moment, a gentle breeze blew by, and he finally closed his eyes slowly.
1:59:52|2:0:12|After this battle, due to the loyalty and bravery of the Roman martyrs, Emperor Yuan of the Great Han Dynasty specially decreed to allow the Romans to establish a city on the Silk Road. As Prince Puli's status was noble, the word for king in the Roman language was chosen as the name of this city, translated into Chinese as Li Jian.
2:0:13|2:0:27|In addition, due to [Huo An] ensuring the stability of the Great Han border, the Emperor made an exception and granted his request. Roman soldiers and the righteous men of Yanmen Pass all belong to the Protectorate, forming the new Western Region Peacekeeping Army.
2:0:28|2:0:37|After the completion of the Li-Jian Ancient City, [Huo An] and the Roman soldiers together placed General Huo Qubing's armor on a towering stone pillar in the center of the city.
2:1:27|2:1:34|But then, [Huo An] remembered the scene from many years ago when he met General Huo Qubing at Yanmen Pass.
2:1:34|2:1:50|At that time, Huo An angrily pointed at the city, vowing to have the flags of thirty-six nations flying outside the Yanmen Pass. Now, not only has this wish been fulfilled, but the goal of coexistence with the enemy has also found tangible expression. Li Xian, this ancient city, is the best proof.
2:1:54|2:2:1|The voice of Lu Kuisi's deputy pulled Huo An out of his memories, hearing the other party refer to himself as the commander of the legion.
2:2:2|2:2:8|[Huo An] once again recalled the words [Lu Kuisi] had asked on the broken city wall.
2:2:10|2:2:16|If we were to lose the friends we made today tomorrow, would it still be worth making those connections?
2:2:17|2:2:36|Now, looking at his deputy clad in heavy armor with a serious expression, [Huo An] solemnly expresses his gratitude. The answer to the previous question has been concluded. The towering Cloud Armor in front of him further exemplifies the meaning of coexistence with the enemy that [Huo An] has always pursued.
2:2:36|2:2:45|Time passes, years change, and although the wings of the fierce bird made of stubborn stones have long been broken and weathered under the wind and frost.
2:2:46|2:3:2|But the meaning it represents of peace, friendship, and unity still shines brightly in the long river of history. After reconstructing the entire story through satellite, [Kairina] is very happy to witness this historical moment with [Kristi].
2:3:4|2:3:12|Bowing his head to look at [Kairina] leaning on his shoulder, [Christopher] also sighed at the deeply moving friendship of [Huo An] and others.
