0:3:4|0:3:12|After speaking, Xiaotian turned and ran, with [Liu Jinxi] angrily chasing after him. Outside the cowshed, in the kitchen, the woman packed the sliced bamboo shoots into a plate.
0:3:13|0:3:20|He then carried it and walked towards the house. At this moment, the two brothers ran down from the second floor.
0:3:39|0:4:0|The man with braids pulled out Xiaotian's tooth with his hand, and then stored it in a jar. The scene shifted, with four people sitting around a dining table eating. The woman picked up a bowl of porridge from the table and scooped a bowl for Xiaotian. Because he had just lost a tooth, Xiaotian kept touching his gums while drinking the porridge.
0:4:21|0:4:28|The brother took a sip of porridge, then looked up and asked the woman.
0:4:34|0:4:51|Xiaotian smiled and patted the table, saying to his brother. After finishing the meal, the man with braids wrapped the file in cowhide cloth and put it in a bamboo basket. He picked up his straw hat and walked out of the bamboo house. The cow kept lowing twice on the outdoor platform on the second floor, as if saying goodbye to him.
0:4:51|0:5:10|Coming out from his home, Liu Jinxi walked through the bamboo forest, crossed the grassland, passed a small bridge, and arrived at a meadow. He first smashed the straw with a bamboo pole, then placed it on a stone slab, and stood on a wooden stake, hitting the straw up and down.
0:5:10|0:5:22|There are five or six more people. When the straw is almost beaten, someone will spread it out on a bamboo screen, sift it in the water, then fish it out and dry it to make paper.
0:5:41|0:5:49|Liu Jinxi scraped the wood chips off the window with a file, then wiped it with his hand before gently pasting the paper on.
0:5:49|0:6:10|At this moment, Liu Jinxi and Xu Baijiu walked into the village with powerful strides. Both of them had a bag slung over their shoulders, with a handle-wrapped item inside. The children were not afraid of these two strangers and circled around them. They then entered a shop.
0:6:24|0:6:39|The waiter responded to the short man. The shop owner asked the two of them. The two sitting by the window did not answer the owner's question, so the owner spoke again.
0:6:49|0:7:2|The shopkeeper joked at the counter with a smile, but the two still ignored him.
0:7:17|0:7:24|The waiter pointed in the direction across the street for Liu Jinxi.
0:7:40|0:8:1|The door that was originally open was closed by the short man. Seeing this, the shopkeeper quickly put the silver on the table into his pocket. Then he quietly picked up the stick from the counter and smashed it towards the short man. The shopkeeper was old and weak, and the short man directly took the stick away. The man with short hair also kicked away the shop assistant who came to help.
0:8:6|0:8:24|The boss lady saw the shopkeeper being kicked hard by the short man, she hurried over to beg for mercy, but was directly grabbed by the hair by the short man and pushed to the other end of the counter. Unable to find the silver, the man with short hair used a bamboo basket to knock down the pole supporting the window, then returned to the counter and kicked the shopkeeper hard.
0:8:24|0:8:32|The short man then pulled out the long knife behind him and waved it from left to right to intimidate the innkeeper.
0:8:33|0:8:51|Just as the man with short hair was about to kick the head of the shopkeeper, [Liu Jinxi] hiding in the dark took a deep breath and rushed out. After the man with short hair, who was grabbed by the waist, reacted, he fiercely elbowed [Liu Jinxi]'s back. Seeing that [Liu Jinxi] still didn't let go, the short man with a knife came at him.
0:8:51|0:8:56|But [Liu Jinxi] flipped upside down, kicked off the ground with force, and dodged up to the ceiling.
0:8:58|0:9:6|The short-haired man who was mistakenly injured threw [Liu Jinxi] out by grabbing his waist, while the short man with a knife looked for an opportunity.
0:9:9|0:9:37|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] once again embraced the short-haired man's waist and took a few steps, then was lifted by the short-haired man and slammed hard against the counter. The short man even wielded a knife towards his direction, but [Liu Jinxi] always managed to cleverly dodge before being struck. Bending over, he dragged the short-haired man to the window, but exerted too much force, causing his forehead to slam hard against the door frame. Seizing the opportunity, the short-haired man ruthlessly kneed [Liu Jinxi] in the stomach, then once again used his elbow to strike his back.
0:9:37|0:9:51|On the other side, the short man struggled to pull out the big knife stuck in the counter for a while, then turned around and drew another knife, slashing horizontally towards [Liu Jinxi]. Helplessly, [Liu Jinxi] lowered his body, causing the blade to cut off the left ear of the short-haired man.
0:9:51|0:10:4|Seeing the short man running towards him with a knife, the man with short hair screamed, and then a swift kick from a divine dragon sent him flying out. Following that, he grabbed [Liu Jinxi] by the collar and viciously threw him, causing [Liu Jinxi] to crash into the counter.
0:10:5|0:10:23|The tremor caused the windows of the cabinet shop to close completely, and the villagers outside were scared and quickly left. At this moment, seeing the short-haired man approaching again, [Liu Jinxi] quickly crawled towards the depths of the counter. The short man also raised his knife high and jumped over the counter, heading straight towards [Liu Jinxi].
0:10:24|0:10:41|Just as the blade was about to pierce [Liu Jinxi]'s body, the short man's head violently slammed into the cabinet next to the counter. Seeing the short man die on the spot, the man with short hair looked down at [Liu Jinxi] on the ground, then at the knife. At this moment, the sound of the fight stopped.
0:10:41|0:10:57|The boss lady hurriedly crawled towards the door, just as she was about to carefully stand up by holding onto the counter, she saw [Liu Jinxi] and the man with short hair struggling and pushing open the door. Subsequently, the two of them fell into a shallow pond together. The students who were studying nearby looked at them.
0:10:58|0:11:7|Liu Jinxi's eldest son called out to him anxiously. At that moment, in the pond filled with water grass, the man with short hair was pounding Liu Jinxi in the water with his fists.
0:11:7|0:11:25|[Liu Jinxi], after swallowing hard a few times, continuously swung his fists towards the man with short hair. When one of the punches landed on the left side of the man's face, he suddenly froze in place, then staggered backwards and fell. At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] quickly walked out of the pond towards the shore.
0:11:34|0:11:53|Seeing [Liu Jinxi] lying weakly on the shore, his eldest son quickly squatted down and touched him. The man with short hair lay with his eyes open on the pond, then drifted away slowly with the flowing water. Upon closer inspection, the eyeball of his left eye had completely turned black.
0:11:53|0:11:58|At this moment, a person lit a stick of incense and took out a small iron rod.
0:12:2|0:12:8|He turned out to be Liu Jinxi, who was examining the body as a coroner.
0:12:14|0:12:22|Liu Jinxi's eldest son Fangzheng was interrupted by the police while kicking the corpse.
0:12:29|0:12:38|The young man walked while covering his mouth and nose with a handkerchief, then carefully stared at the two bodies after putting down his umbrella.
0:12:40|0:12:52|In the tavern, the waiter brought a plate of scallions, which the boss took and handed to the master. The master picked up two pieces and stuffed them into his mouth.
0:13:4|0:13:18|At this moment, Liu Jinxi squatted down beside the swollen corpse and began poking it with a small iron rod. Suddenly, he noticed a line tattooed below the right ear of the deceased, which read "Criminal Yan Dongsheng." Seeing this, Liu Jinxi widened his eyes in shock.
0:15:30|0:15:36|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] tore open the seal and entered the cabinet, which remained exactly as it was when the crime occurred.
0:15:40|0:15:50|[Xu Baijiu] walked in from the main entrance, then approached the counter. While observing the surroundings, he suddenly noticed a small hole in a glass bottle of medicinal wine on the counter.
0:15:50|0:16:4|With doubts in his heart, he quickly discovered something at the bottom of the bottle. He then reached into the bottle and took out a tooth from below, examining it in front of his eyes. [Xu Baijiu] fell into contemplation.
0:16:6|0:16:27|After watching the cabinet, [Xu Baijiu] came to the edge of the pond, looking at the pond full of water plants. He quickly walked towards the center. Soon he found the place where [Yan Dongsheng] had choked to death, recalling the scene of the autopsy and realizing that the eyes of the body had all turned black.
0:16:27|0:16:42|The surroundings were filled with bloodshot eyes. So, [Xu Baijiu] scooped up a handful of water from the waist-deep pond, took a sip, then scooped up another handful and spat it out. Looking at the calm and clear pond, [Xu Baijiu] fell into contemplation.
0:17:28|0:17:46|After getting the information from the innkeeper, [Xu Baijiu] went to the morgue. He shooed away the annoying flies, then lifted the cloth covering [Yan Dongsheng]'s body and picked up the kerosene lamp hanging on the wall, placing it next to [Yan Dongsheng]'s head. At that moment, he discovered from [Yan Dongsheng]'s open mouth,
0:17:46|0:17:52|He is missing a tooth, and his eyes are bloodshot.
0:19:5|0:19:12|In his memory, Liu Jinxi came to the tavern. After sitting down, he saw something resembling small balls on the table.
0:19:44|0:20:5|[Xu Baijiu] rubbed his chin in thought, then picked up a glass of wine from the table and drank it. At night, in the bathroom of [Liu Jinxi]'s house, a person was cleaning the fish maw in the basin one by one. It turned out to be [A Yu] wearing a bellyband.
0:20:6|0:20:11|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] was buttoning up his shirt while walking into the restroom, he lowered his head and said to [A Yu].
0:20:25|0:20:37|Leaning against the door frame, [Liu Jinxi] smiled and then turned around, walking into the room. [A Yu] put on a coat and approached [Liu Jinxi] from behind.
0:20:55|0:21:3|[A Yu] squatted down and looked at [Liu Jinxi] sitting on his left, softly comforting him. [Liu Jinxi] then smiled and nodded.
0:21:38|0:21:51|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] was sitting cross-legged on the bed in the inn, suddenly spitting out a mouthful of blood.
0:22:20|0:22:25|In the memory, [Xu Baijiu] sat paralyzed at the dining table, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.
0:22:34|0:22:51|So [Xu Baijiu] aimed the needle directly at the center of the sternal notch. The nearly 10-centimeter needle was inserted halfway into the Tianzhu acupoint.
0:22:55|0:23:17|This is the doppelganger imagined by [Xu Baijiu]. At this moment, he is sitting across from [Xu Baijiu], looking coldly. The next morning, the sound of chopping vegetables came from outside a small house. The camera zoomed in, revealing that it was [A Yu] preparing food. The sound of coughing startled her.
0:23:17|0:23:23|Turning around, [Liu Jinxi] realized it was actually Xu Baijiu. A Yu smiled at him.
0:23:54|0:24:0|[A Yu], who was about to ladle porridge, suddenly stopped and then put down the lid of the pot.
0:24:7|0:24:13|In his memory, [Liu Jinxi] knelt before the clan leader, watching his name being inscribed into the family genealogy.
0:24:22|0:24:33|Just as she straightened up, [A Yu] heard [Xu Baijiu] asking. So she once again fell into memories, standing in the pond scooping fish with a bamboo basket, then looking towards the shore.
0:24:54|0:25:3|[A Yu] shook the lunch box. [A Yu] blinked and said.
0:25:5|0:25:11|Seeing [A Yu] turning towards the stove, [Xu Baijiu] squinted and asked. After listening, [A Yu] turned back and glanced at him.
0:25:47|0:26:15|While talking, [A Yu] is stirring the vegetables with a spoon. Then [A Yu] picks up the vegetables from the stove, thinks for a moment, and looks straight at [Xu Baijiu]. The scene shifts, [Liu Jinxi] is still the same as usual, leaving home and arriving at the grassland, crossing through the misty grassland, and entering the dense forest.
0:26:15|0:26:28|At this moment, the sun has risen. Under the sunlight, [Liu Jinxi] is wearing a straw hat, walking through the rugged forest, and finally arriving at the paper mill, where he is pounding paper scraps up and down.
0:26:31|0:26:36|[Xu Baijiu] found [Liu Jinxi] and brought him to the cabinet shop.
0:27:1|0:27:21|From the perspective of [Xu Baijiu], [Liu Jinxi] first took a sharp elbow from Yan Dongsheng at the waist, then he jumped in place, exerted force, and kicked directly on the ceiling with both feet. At this moment, he happened to dodge a knife from the short man. The reason why [Xu Baijiu] thought like this was because he looked up and saw some strange marks on the scene.
0:27:21|0:27:27|There are very clear footprints on the ceiling, door pillars, and rafters.
0:27:35|0:27:42|In Xu Baijiu's eyes, Liu Jinxi dodged Yan Dongsheng's attack, then grabbed his arm and forcefully smashed it down.
0:28:6|0:28:11|After listening to the statements of Liu Jinxi and the innkeeper, Xu Baijiu fell into contemplation.
0:28:11|0:28:27|In his view, when the short man was about to chop [Liu Jinxi] from behind with a knife, [Liu Jinxi] dodged to the side and at the same time pushed Yan Dongsheng's head up with his left palm. The short man, who didn't have time to retract his knife, directly cut off Yan Dongsheng's left ear.
0:28:42|0:28:54|In the landlady's memory, the short man leaped high with a knife from the hall, ready to jump into the counter, but accidentally hit the corner of the counter, and ended up hitting himself to death.
0:28:54|0:29:10|However, Xu Baijiu didn't see it that way. After Yan Dongsheng's ear was cut off, he quickly smashed Liu Jinxi towards the counter, but Liu Jinxi stood firm with his internal strength.
0:29:17|0:29:33|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] saw [Liu Jinxi] standing by the counter with a horse stance, arms open, then clenched his fists tightly after a moment of thought, looking towards Yan Dongsheng's direction. He noticed that [Liu Jinxi] seemed like a completely different person, while Yan Dongsheng was panting heavily with his mouth open.
0:29:33|0:29:55|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] kicked the water scoop on the ground towards the window, and then the entire cabinet shop became sealed. Seeing [Liu Jinxi] like this, Yan Dongsheng and the short man took small steps towards him. Suddenly, Yan Dongsheng took the initiative to attack, smashing towards [Liu Jinxi] with fast and fierce punches. Unexpectedly, [Liu Jinxi] agilely dodged and even grabbed Yan Dongsheng's eyes with a claw.
0:29:55|0:30:1|After pushing away Liu Jinxi's hand, Yan Dongsheng angrily swung his fists at him again.
0:30:1|0:30:17|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] used his left hand to press down on Yan Dongsheng's arm and fist on his abdomen, then struck Yan Dongsheng's right elbow with his right hand. Following the clenched fist, Yan Dongsheng punched himself in the face, causing a tooth to be knocked out directly.
0:30:17|0:30:29|After puncturing the medicine wine bottle on the counter, it slowly fell into the bottom of the bottle. But Yan Dongsheng was not giving up, [Liu Jinxi] circled behind him, pressing his knee against his leg, waiting for Yan Dongsheng to just turn around.
0:30:29|0:30:46|[Liu Jinxi] has rushed up to him, then, kicked Yan Dongsheng's abdomen fiercely with three kicks, causing Yan Dongsheng to spit blood from his mouth, clutching his stomach and kneeling directly on the ground. Seeing this, the short man picked up a knife and tried to chop at [Liu Jinxi], but [Liu Jinxi] jumped onto the counter, dodging every swing of the short man's knife.
0:30:46|0:30:55|When he reached the counter, [Liu Jinxi] did a backflip over the short man behind him, then hooked one foot on the beam. Looking at [Liu Jinxi] like this,
0:30:55|0:31:12|The short man hesitated for a moment, then swung the knife towards him. [Liu Jinxi] dodged it, hanging upside down, with his index finger slightly bent, directly pointing at the left clavicle of the short man, causing his heart to stop instantly as the point hit a blood vessel.
0:31:20|0:31:31|Therefore, the short man fell to the ground with his eyes wide open, and after seeing him die, [Liu Jinxi] jumped down from the rafters.
0:31:44|0:31:50|Liu Jinxi pushed open the door of the cabinet and brought Xu Baijiu to the edge of the pond.
0:31:52|0:31:58|[Xu Baijiu] looked at the innocent face of [Liu Jinxi] and voiced his question.
0:32:5|0:32:20|[Xu Baijiu] believes that [Liu Jinxi] is intentionally hiding in the pond to make others think he really doesn't know kung fu. By staying below the water's surface, Yan Dongsheng's force cannot be exerted, so he can only punch the water surface to waste energy.
0:32:20|0:32:40|Although [Liu Jinxi] demonstrated in front of [Xu Baijiu] how he struggled and resisted at that time, [Xu Baijiu] insisted that evil is in those with strong martial arts skills. At that moment, his right hand formed a fist, using the thumb joint to fiercely strike Yan Dongsheng's temple, causing Yan Dongsheng's cheek to quickly swell up.
0:32:49|0:32:57|Therefore, [Yan Dongsheng] fell straight backwards.
0:34:19|0:34:39|The clan leader gathered at the home of [Liu Jinxi], and after telling [A Yu] the good news, she shed tears of joy. At that moment, [Liu Jinxi] was cutting bamboo in the bamboo forest, lifting the bamboo with one hand and wiping sweat with his sleeve from time to time. [Xu Baijiu] was carefully observing his movements on the side.
0:34:54|0:34:58|[Liu Jinxi] ignored [Xu Baijiu] and walked across the stone bridge carrying bamboo.
0:35:6|0:35:12|[Xu Baijiu] suddenly grabbed the end of the bamboo and forcefully flung [Liu Jinxi] off the stone bridge.
0:35:26|0:35:40|Who knew the branch suddenly broke, and he fell headfirst into the turbulent river below. Standing at the bridge, [Xu Baijiu] fell into contemplation.
0:36:6|0:36:21|Seeing five or six workers supporting [Liu Jinxi] as they walked from the riverbank, [Xu Baijiu] squatted by the bridge and asked with a smile. [Liu Jinxi] shook his head at first, then walked up and squatted opposite [Xu Baijiu].
0:37:0|0:37:10|[Liu Jinxi] wiped the water off his face with his hand, and when he saw [Xu Baijiu] looking at him seriously, he thought for a moment before smiling and saying.
0:37:21|0:37:36|After speaking, the smile on [Liu Jinxi]'s face gradually disappeared, but his eyes remained fixed on [Xu Baijiu]. After a moment of silence, [Xu Baijiu] spoke.
0:37:37|0:38:3|[Xu Baijiu] didn't speak again, but crossed his hands in front of his chest, looking excitedly at [Liu Jinxi]. The scene then shifted to the edge of the pond in the village, where women were washing clothes.
0:38:51|0:39:9|The man smoking a cigar walked past the pond with [Xu Baijiu], gave him some instructions, and then left the village. As night fell, [Liu Jinxi]'s family was having hotpot around the table, but [A Yu] seemed very uneasy, as it turned out that [Xu Baijiu] was also present.
0:39:31|0:39:39|[Xu Baijiu] answered while eating vegetables.
0:40:34|0:40:56|[Xu Baijiu] chewed on some vegetables, then pointed at Xiaotian and asked. Xiaotian, upon hearing Xu Baijiu call his name, first looked up at him, then widened his eyes and looked towards [Liu Jinxi]. However, [Liu Jinxi] did not respond, but instead picked up a piece of vegetable from the hotpot and put it into Xiaotian's bowl.
0:41:12|0:41:22|Facing Xu Baijiu's questioning, Liu Jinxi put down his bowl, took a sip of wine, and nodded.
0:41:28|0:41:34|[Liu Jinxi] put down his chopsticks, lowered his head to look at the table, while [A Yu] carefully raised her eyes to look at him.
0:41:44|0:41:50|[Liu Jinxi] turned his head to the left and glanced at [Xu Baijiu] while speaking.
0:42:6|0:42:23|Afterwards, he turned around and looked at the boiling hotpot in front of him, lost in thought, and whispered. After hearing this story, [Xu Baijiu] was stunned.
0:42:23|0:42:35|Liu Jinxi then lifted the wine glass proactively, gesturing to have a drink with him. Xu Baijiu, who had come to his senses, quickly picked up the wine glass next to him in response, but still squinted at him.
0:42:36|0:42:52|Xiaotian asked foolishly. [Liu Jinxi] looked at Xiaotian, smiled and shook his head, but when he looked up, he saw the worried face of [A Yu]. So he grinned at [A Yu], indicating that he was fine now.
0:42:53|0:43:2|Liu Jinxi then turned around and reminded [Xu Baijiu], who quickly took out his pocket watch.
0:43:10|0:43:30|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] picked up the clothes on the chair, stood up from the dining table, walked straight to the door, and headed towards the direction of the second floor. It was late at night, and he actually squatted by the bed of [Liu Jinxi] and his wife, observing [Liu Jinxi], and then unsatisfiedly pressed his ear against [Liu Jinxi]'s nose.
0:43:40|0:43:46|Liu Jinxi looked at his hands and feet, then suddenly opened his eyes and collided head-on with Xu Baijiu.
0:43:47|0:44:12|He sat up with effort. [Xu Baijiu] showed no sign of apology. In response, [Liu Jinxi] sighed helplessly. He propped himself up with his thighs, sat up from the bed, and slowly walked towards the dining table. [Xu Baijiu] frowned and squatted at the edge of the bed, watching him leave.
0:44:29|0:44:34|In the center of the village, [Fang Zheng] hears his own name,
0:44:42|0:44:54|[Liu Jinxi] and his wife smiled as they helped [Fang Zheng] put on his robe. Meanwhile, [Xu Baijiu] sat in the tavern, watching the scene with [Liu Jinxi] and his family.
0:44:56|0:45:15|[Fang Zheng] put on his outer robe, walked away from [Liu Jinxi], and took a stick of incense from a clan member. [Liu Jinxi] smiled as he watched Fang Zheng's figure, then suddenly noticed [Xu Baijiu] in a nearby tavern. At that moment, [Sect Leader] led the boys holding incense, gathering in front of the line.
0:45:22|0:45:27|The boys then eagerly stepped up the stairs and inserted the incense into the censer.
0:45:28|0:45:41|On the other side, [Liu Jinxi] crossed the bustling crowd in the center of the village and entered the tavern. He then sat down next to [Xu Baijiu], let out a long sigh, and watched as he raised his glass and drank heartily.
0:45:43|0:45:50|[Xu Baijiu] froze in the middle of drinking, and after setting down his glass, he said.
0:46:24|0:46:41|[Xu Baijiu] gave a wry smile at [Liu Jinxi], who pursed his lips. Then, he spoke. [Xu Baijiu], who had been looking down at his wine glass, immediately looked up at [Liu Jinxi]. [Liu Jinxi] blinked and then mustered up the courage to speak.
0:46:58|0:47:4|At this point, [Liu Jinxi] couldn't help but lower his head, tightly shut his eyes, and then spoke again.
0:48:10|0:48:18|Liu Jinxi, who was originally bowing his head, suddenly stood up and looked at Xu Baijiu. Xu Baijiu thought for a moment and immediately was shocked speechless.
0:48:28|0:48:34|Originally, Xu Baijiu's initial intuition was correct - Liu Jinxi is indeed suspicious.
0:48:43|0:48:50|[Liu Jinxi] lowered his eyes and prayed softly. While [Xu Baijiu] gasped for breath and stared at him.
0:49:11|0:49:28|Outside the house, he picked up Xiaotian with one hand supporting his bottom, then turned to look in the direction of [Xu Baijiu], locking eyes with him. [Xu Baijiu] watched the family of four, slowly stood up, then blended into the crowd and followed behind them.
0:49:28|0:49:42|In the bustling market, villagers led cows and sheep into the crowd. The animals attracted many flies, some even crawling on people's necks and shoulders. Suddenly, [Xu Baijiu] was shocked.
0:49:58|0:50:12|At this moment, the imaginary doppelganger created by [Xu Baijiu] appeared again. Therefore, [Xu Baijiu] grabbed a sickle and rushed behind [Liu Jinxi], catching him off guard and fiercely chopping at his right shoulder.
0:50:12|0:50:31|A Yu, who was joking with Liu Jinxi, was startled by the sudden turn of events, and let out a scream on the spot. Fangzheng and Xiaotian also froze, staring at Xu Baijiu with wide eyes. Liu Jinxi himself was shocked, gritting his teeth as he looked at his shoulder, then turned his head to look at him. Xu Baijiu, feeling discouraged, returned to the inn.
0:50:31|0:50:50|Sitting on the edge of the bed, [Liu Jinxi] angrily threw the umbrella in his hand and then kicked towards the imaginary doppelganger. He then headed to the tavern.
0:51:22|0:51:43|After being angrily scolded by the villagers, [Xu Baijiu] returned to the room. He looked at the tightly closed door, breathing heavily. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door, and [Xu Baijiu] pursed his lips as he opened the door. The visitor was the man who had smoked a cigar earlier.
0:52:7|0:52:16|The identity of the man with the cigar turned out to be a spy.
0:52:50|0:53:14|[Xu Baijiu] recalled the scene of the crime, then said. At this moment, the young [Liu Jinxi] stood in the butcher's house, surrounded by the bones of cows and sheep hanging all around, and the ground littered with dissected bodies. However, he remained calm and composed, looking at everything here calmly.
0:53:26|0:53:42|In pouring rain, [Xu Baijiu] hurriedly walked with an umbrella towards the county town, only to meet [Liu Jinxi] on a small path in the village. He was leading the villagers to shelter from the rain with an old cow, and their eyes met as they looked up.
0:53:44|0:54:8|The hidden thunder startled [Xu Baijiu], who now knew the true identity of [Liu Jinxi]. He stood there in disbelief as he watched [Liu Jinxi] happily smiling at him. Later, the two of them sought shelter from the rain in a pavilion. After [Xu Baijiu] closed the umbrella, he wiped his face with his sleeve, using this action to secretly observe [Liu Jinxi].
0:54:10|0:54:17|Stuttering [Liu Jinxi] dared not look at [Xu Baijiu], but as soon as he finished speaking, he turned his head towards him and spoke.
0:54:31|0:54:51|Then he opened his mouth, smiled, and looked at [Liu Jinxi]. At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] turned his head to glance at [Xu Baijiu], smiled, and then turned to look into the distance. Meanwhile, [Xu Baijiu] trembled and lowered his head.
0:54:54|0:55:11|After speaking, without waiting for [Xu Baijiu]'s response, [Liu Jinxi] put on his straw hat and walked out of the pavilion. The rain had stopped by now, and he had already entered the jungle with [Xu Baijiu]. The tall and straight trees made everything around them misty. As they passed by a tombstone,
0:55:11|0:55:24|The chilling scream echoed into the ears. [Liu Jinxi] walked ahead and whispered softly.
0:55:29|0:55:43|[Xu Baijiu] followed behind, watching [Liu Jinxi]'s back. Suddenly, [Liu Jinxi] stopped in his tracks, then slowly turned around to face [Xu Baijiu], who was five steps away, and spoke.
0:55:44|0:55:57|[Xu Baijiu] held his breath for a moment, swallowed hard, and stared at [Liu Jinxi] without blinking. At that moment, [Liu Jinxi] smiled at him, then turned around and continued walking forward.
0:55:57|0:56:13|When Liu Jinxi was ten steps away from him, Xu Baijiu took another step forward, walking two steps and then stopping behind. Suddenly, Liu Jinxi stopped again, slowly turned around, and smiled at Xu Baijiu.
0:56:14|0:56:31|The two of them walked right up to the tombstone. After listening, [Xu Baijiu] took a small step back and then stood still, watching [Liu Jinxi] approach. At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] stood in front of [Xu Baijiu], looked at him, and suddenly reached out his right hand.
0:56:31|0:56:40|He had his arms around [Xu Baijiu]'s back, then he said.
0:56:41|0:57:0|[Xu Baijiu] glanced to the right, his left hand resting on [Liu Jinxi]'s waist unmoving. Then, [Liu Jinxi] released his back, ending this brief embrace, and looked at him to speak.
0:57:1|0:57:14|[Xu Baijiu] instantly came to his senses, grinned at [Liu Jinxi], then swayed past him. In that passing moment, [Liu Jinxi] slowly turned towards [Xu Baijiu], unmoving, staring at his back.
0:57:15|0:57:36|It seems like he can feel the pressure coming from behind. [Xu Baijiu] tightly closed his lips, stiffened his neck, and walked forward mechanically. Suddenly, he stopped in his tracks, then slowly looked back. At this moment, in the vast forest, there was no trace of [Liu Jinxi]. Everything around seemed to be sleeping in the fear of death.
0:57:36|0:57:58|So [Xu Baijiu] turned around and ran desperately forward, the tombstones standing everywhere in the forest and the eerie screams giving people the illusion of being in the underworld. Therefore, [Xu Baijiu] ran faster and faster, passing through narrow and winding forest paths until he was exhausted.
0:58:0|0:58:8|The scene shifts, and [Xu Baijiu] arrives at a bathhouse.
0:58:47|0:58:56|Captain Hu Zi thought for a moment before speaking.
0:59:11|0:59:23|[Xu Baijiu] saw Captain Hu Zichang turn and leave, angrily smashing the table. At this moment, the busy street was filled with people coming and going.
0:59:25|0:59:40|[Xu Baijiu] stood lifelessly in the crowd. As night fell, he arrived at a grand mansion and stood on the stone street in front of the hall, staring at the plaques on the platform in silence. The sound of servants passing by in the mansion...
0:59:40|0:59:55|Make him slowly come to his senses. Then, he looked up to the right and saw a woman in a cheongsam standing on the second-floor corridor, looking at him. Later, the two sat together in the lobby, and the woman handed something to [Xu Baijiu].
0:59:56|1:0:18|The woman turned out to be his ex-wife, and it was obvious what she had just given him. After receiving the money, [Xu Baijiu] quickly put it into his bag. Then he asked with a sneer. His ex-wife lowered her head, hands clasped on her lap, and responded softly.
1:0:35|1:0:54|Looking at his ex-wife's sad expression, [Xu Baijiu] asked her. His ex-wife suddenly looked up at [Xu Baijiu], thought for a moment, and then lowered her head to speak.
1:1:15|1:1:35|Liu Jinxi's ex-wife's tears were swirling in her eyes, and [Xu Baijiu] looked at her like this, blinked, shook his head, and then spoke. After speaking, he lowered his head.
1:1:47|1:2:7|Although [Xu Baijiu] kept his head down, his ex-wife still stared at him intently. They had now arrived at a bustling street. [Xu Baijiu] sat on the horse, deep in thought. He and his colleagues slowly made their way through the lively crowd, walking forward with determination.
1:2:22|1:2:39|[Xu Baijiu] exchanged the silver ticket for a gambling ticket, first went to the foreman to complain, then went to his ex-wife's house. In the hall, he took off his hat, bowed deeply to his ex-father-in-law's tablet. Suddenly, the scene changed.
1:3:2|1:3:9|Captain Hu said to [Sect Leader].
1:3:13|1:3:19|Captain Hu turned back to look at [Xu Kun], then he shrunk his neck and looked up at [Sect Leader].
1:3:20|1:3:27|Surrounded by strong henchmen, Captain Hu with a long beard trembled and said fearfully.
1:4:2|1:4:10|[Xu Kun] lifted the bearded officer up and held him in front of him.
1:4:20|1:4:27|With that, [Sect Leader] clenched his right fist and fiercely smashed the thumb joint towards the temple of Commander Hu.
1:4:28|1:4:40|In an instant, General Beard's eyes were bloodshot, then he slumped down diagonally. In the warehouse, not a single person dared to respond.
1:4:54|1:5:8|In the warehouse, a woman in armor narrowed her eyes after listening to Xu Baijiu's words. Back in the village, the old people sat around a pile of grass, wearing grasshoppers.
1:5:9|1:5:25|After forcefully breaking off the head of a live grasshopper, threading a thin stick through its tail, pulling the grasshopper's body down, and then continuing to thread another live one, on the other side in the center of the village, the children have all put on their costumes and are ready to perform an opera.
1:5:32|1:5:46|Beside the haystack, a burly man lifted a hoe and vigorously turned the soil, muttering something from time to time. At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] and a group of colleagues rode slowly past on horseback, and then he asked the person next to him.
1:5:57|1:6:19|A colleague looked at the villagers working and then explained to [Xu Baijiu]. Suddenly, several people riding horses, wearing armor and holding torches, arrived in the village. As they passed by the villagers' houses, they directly threw the torches inside. The entire village was gathered in the center, watching the children sing opera.
1:6:19|1:6:26|The drums and gongs were lively, and no one noticed anything unusual. Soon, the village was set on fire by those people everywhere.
1:6:53|1:7:6|As soon as the words fell, [Xu Baijiu] descended from the roof, a woman in armor stepped over the line and landed on the ground. After scanning the villagers with narrowed eyes, she turned around and walked towards [Liu Jinxi].
1:7:8|1:7:15|Liu Jinxi remained indifferent as Thirteen Sister delivered a slap. Then she pointed fiercely at Liu Jinxi.
1:7:17|1:7:25|[Liu Jinxi] squinted his eyes and looked at Thirteen Sister. Suddenly, Thirteen Sister kicked [Liu Jinxi] in the abdomen.
1:7:26|1:7:33|Next, [Sect Leader] pushed [Liu Jinxi] forcefully, stepping on his chest, causing him to spit out blood on the spot.
1:7:36|1:7:49|[A Yu] covered Fangzheng's mouth, looking worriedly at the fallen [Liu Jinxi]. Seeing that [Liu Jinxi] showed no intention of fighting back, Thirteen Sister withdrew her foot and shouted at the people around her.
1:7:57|1:8:2|The villagers were instantly scared and backed away, while [A Yu] quickly covered Fangzheng and Xiaotian's eyes.
1:8:3|1:8:17|Thirteen Sister stood in front of the crowd, holding a short knife, glaring angrily at [Liu Jinxi]. Suddenly, she grabbed a villager and was about to strike. [Liu Jinxi] finally took action, grabbing a table and throwing it towards Thirteen Sister.
1:8:17|1:8:36|Thirteen Sister immediately turned the blade around, forcefully stabbing it into the table, and then, with a swing, split the table in half. At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] had already arrived in front of Thirteen Sister, kicking fiercely towards her. Although Thirteen Sister blocked with her arm, she was still sent flying by [Liu Jinxi]'s force.
1:8:37|1:8:49|Seeing [Liu Jinxi] finally responding, Thirteen Sister's lips curved slightly. Then, [Liu Jinxi] opened his feet, his fists moving from his chest to his waist like shooting stars, and finally he stretched out like a bow.
1:8:49|1:9:6|In a suave and handsome posture, Xiao Tian's eyes widened on the spot. Seeing this, [Xu Baijiu] also struck the same pose and attacked [Liu Jinxi]. Four fists exchanged blows in the air, while Thirteen Sister pulled out a short knife and swung her dual blades towards [Liu Jinxi].
1:9:6|1:9:11|[Liu Jinxi] maneuvered between the two, using his elbow to strike heavily at the foot that Thirteen Sister kicked towards him.
1:9:12|1:9:24|Shortly after, a divine dragon-like kick was aimed at [Xu Baijiu]'s neck. [Xu Baijiu] was sent flying directly to the side of a chair. Then, taking advantage of Thirteen Sister's distraction, he grabbed her waist and fiercely threw her into the air.
1:9:24|1:9:42|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] had already climbed up from the ground, steadied himself, and charged towards [Liu Jinxi] once again. [Liu Jinxi] lowered his center of gravity, and his fists took turns striking at [Xu Baijiu]'s abdomen. Then he jumped in place and ruthlessly kneed [Xu Baijiu] in the temple. Following that, he mercilessly struck [Xu Baijiu]'s chest as if releasing pent-up anger.
1:9:42|1:9:47|During the action, the table with the mahjong tiles was shaken down.
1:9:48|1:9:57|[Liu Jinxi] listened and instantly became alert. When he turned his head, he found that the villagers around him had already left. [A Yu] was staring at him in a daze.
1:10:0|1:10:19|The villagers in the distance only just realized that their houses were on fire, so they all rushed back home. [Liu Jinxi] took a glance at [A Yu], who was holding two children, then turned and ran towards the outskirts of the village. Passing by a villager's house, he swiftly flipped over and stepped on the roof tiles, taking a shortcut to quickly leave.
1:10:19|1:10:30|Thirteen Sister took a look at the mother and son, then immediately turned around and caught up with [Liu Jinxi]. At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] was stepping on roof tiles, running ahead, while Thirteen Sister was following closely behind, swinging her double knives.
1:10:30|1:10:47|[A Yu] and the two children just stood there, watching as [Liu Jinxi] moved further and further away from them. Gradually, [Liu Jinxi]'s figure disappeared from their sight. The scene shifted, and [Liu Jinxi] jumped down from a three-meter high roof, rolled to cushion the impact, and then continued to accelerate forward.
1:10:47|1:11:4|When he reached the eaves, he lightly supported himself with both hands, then leaped up effortlessly, easily clearing the obstacle. Unexpectedly, as he descended, the roof was not sturdy, and [Liu Jinxi] fell straight into the cowshed. Seeing Thirteen Sister following closely behind and jumping down as well, he quickly grabbed the iron chain on the eaves and kicked towards her.
1:11:5|1:11:10|Liu Jinxi looked at Thirteen Sister standing up and said.
1:11:14|1:11:29|So [Liu Jinxi] tiptoed, raised his arm, and tightly held Thirteen Sister with his right hand. Seeing this, Thirteen Sister launched the first attack, flipping her wrists with the double knives. [Liu Jinxi]'s clothes and sleeves were instantly slashed by the blade.
1:11:29|1:11:42|Then he chased [Liu Jinxi] into the fence, crouched down, and stabbed the knife directly into [Liu Jinxi]'s left thigh, followed by kicking his cheek with his foot, causing [Liu Jinxi] to crash through the fence and fall into the corner.
1:11:42|1:11:54|Thirteen Sister pursued aggressively, wielding her dual blades towards [Liu Jinxi]. Unexpectedly, he rolled forward with a flip, watching as [Liu Jinxi] stood up again, raising both hands in front of his chest with slightly bent fingers, assuming a stance.
1:11:54|1:12:14|Thirteen Sister wielded her dual blades, swinging and attacking [Liu Jinxi] from both sides. Just as it seemed she would strike his head, he countered with a punch to her inner forearm. Unyielding, Thirteen Sister continued her frenzied assault, the blades flashing past [Liu Jinxi] on either side before she grabbed the hilt and thrust upwards towards his abdomen.
1:12:14|1:12:27|As a result, [Liu Jinxi] stretched out his arms and casually inserted the knife into the wooden stake. Then, [Liu Jinxi] pried open Thirteen Sister's hand holding the knife handle, with his five fingers slightly apart, and ruthlessly bent her fingers downward.
1:12:27|1:12:40|Taking advantage of Thirteen Sister's distraction, he repeatedly punched her neck with both fists, causing her to step back continuously. Then, [Liu Jinxi] kicked away the knife thrown by Thirteen Sister, grabbed her waist, and ruthlessly smashed her towards the feeding trough.
1:12:40|1:12:49|Seeing that she still refused to give up, [Liu Jinxi] leaped in front of Thirteen Sister, his two fingers slightly bent and aimed straight at her eyes, but he hesitated to strike.
1:12:50|1:13:1|Suddenly, Thirteenth Sister swung the wall up and was thrown to the corner by [Liu Jinxi], then pulled out a short knife and ruthlessly stabbed it into the back of the cow. Startled, the cow lifted its front hooves and charged towards [Liu Jinxi] with all its might.
1:13:1|1:13:17|Seeing that they were about to collide, [Liu Jinxi] grabbed the cow's foot with one hand, flipped and jumped, using his leg to hook onto the beam. Meanwhile, Thirteen Sister, who was sitting on the ground, was surrounded by four cows before she could get up. In the chaos, she was directly trampled on her abdomen by the cows.
1:13:17|1:13:25|Suddenly, a cow burst out of the cowshed and ran straight out, with [Liu Jinxi] quickly jumping down from the beam after seeing it.
1:13:25|1:13:42|At this moment, Thirteen Sister was heavily hit by the bull's horns and rolled towards the outside of the cowshed. What was shocking was that outside the cowshed was a raging river, and in the distance, there was a waterfall with a drop of nearly 40 meters. After the bull fell into the river, it was swept straight towards the waterfall by the rushing water.
1:13:42|1:13:49|The waterfall is about as wide as a truck, and the river looks like a raging dragon, making a thunderous sound.
1:13:50|1:14:3|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] clung to the edge of the cowshed with one hand and grabbed Thirteen Sister hanging over the river with the other hand. Thirteen Sister, spitting out blood, looked at [Liu Jinxi] and laughed.
1:14:3|1:14:25|[Liu Jinxi] finally couldn't hold on any longer. The hands that were clasped together gradually separated, and in the end, Thirteen Sister fell into the river, then was swept down a nearly 40-meter waterfall by the rushing current. [Liu Jinxi] maintained the pulling motion, gazing fixedly at the distant waterfall, and silently lowered his head.
1:14:25|1:14:42|On the small road by the river outside the village, a group of men in armor riding horses quickly approached the village. Inside the village, at the home of [Liu Jinxi], [A Yu] was tidying up with the children. After bowing to the memorial tablet, she carefully placed them in a bundle.
1:14:43|1:14:57|At this moment, she caught a glimpse of someone at the door from the corner of her eye. She straightened up, turned around, and realized that the person was actually [Liu Jinxi]. [A Yu] hesitated for a moment, then hurried to the door, supporting him and helping him into the house.
1:14:57|1:15:9|After speaking, [A Yu] walked towards the room, while [Liu Jinxi] slowly half-knelt down, bowing his head to look at the scattered luggage in the room.
1:15:47|1:15:58|Watching [A Yu] squatting in front of him, [Liu Jinxi] with disheveled hair struggled to speak. After hearing it, [A Yu] immediately stood up, turned around, and walked towards the door sobbing.
1:15:58|1:16:13|Arriving at the door, she gently closed it, then used her head to support the door panel, and then raised her hand to securely hang the upper door bolt on the door. After a moment of calm, [A Yu] continued to insert the second door bolt into the door lock.
1:16:13|1:16:27|After inserting the two bolts, she seemed to have used up all her strength, so she did not return to the father and son for a long time. Instead, she kept hitting the door with her head, crying uncontrollably.
1:16:27|1:16:41|[Liu Jinxi] just pursed his lips upon hearing this, without any response. At this moment, [A Yu] stopped crying, turned around to look at Fangzheng and Xiaotian who were packing their bags, silently shed a tear, and whispered.
1:16:43|1:16:59|[A Yu] watched the back of [Liu Jinxi], sniffed, lowered her head and asked again. Then she tightly gripped the door frame, tears continuously dripping down her cheeks.
1:17:0|1:17:13|Upon hearing the question, [Liu Jinxi] did not respond, only blinked his eyes and remained silent. Looking at this [Liu Jinxi], [A Yu] seemed to know the answer to the question, so she turned around, leaned against the door frame, and burst into tears.
1:17:13|1:17:34|Late at night, [Liu Jinxi] sat by Xiaotian's bed, motionless, gazing at him. Watching Xiaotian sleep soundly, [Liu Jinxi] unconsciously swallowed, then drifted into memories. In the butcher's house, a man held a child in each hand and placed them by the door.
1:17:35|1:18:2|The butcher knelt in front of [Liu Jinxi], also known as Tang Long, constantly kowtowing for mercy. [Liu Jinxi] looked up at the two crying children by the door, then lowered the big knife on his shoulder. His men pushed a man under the guillotine, and the crying stopped.
1:18:2|1:18:10|In the butcher's house, several people lay scattered around, while his men squatted down, flipping through them one by one.
1:18:12|1:18:25|A young boy placed under the guillotine called out softly to [Liu Jinxi]. Upon hearing the voice, [Liu Jinxi] slowly walked towards the guillotine from the center of the room. The boy widened his eyes and looked up at him.
1:18:27|1:18:43|The child, who looks to be only five or six years old, is being held up on the blade of a gate. His feet don't even reach the ground, but looking at the handsome face of [Liu Jinxi], the little boy still cries out for help. And [Liu Jinxi] just stares blankly ahead.
1:18:43|1:19:5|Then he walked step by step towards the little boy. The scene cut back to the bedside of Xiao Tian, where [Liu Jinxi] covered his eyes and sobbed softly. Then, he slowly put his hand down, wiped his face, and looked straight at the sleeping Xiao Tian. But tears burst out again at this moment, [Liu Jinxi] shook his head and struggled to speak.
1:19:7|1:19:14|After speaking, he bit his lip, slowly lowered his head, and Xiao Tian, who was sleeping soundly, moved the corners of his mouth.
1:19:15|1:19:33|And [Liu Jinxi] once again covered his eyes with his hands, crying continuously. Suddenly, Xiaotian raised his little hand, touched [Liu Jinxi]'s cheek, and then pulled his hand to his own chest. [Liu Jinxi] instantly stopped crying, holding Xiaotian with one hand and leaning his forehead against him.
1:19:33|1:19:53|The scene shifts to the side of the wooden pavilion in the village, where villagers are kneeling around a wooden table. The priest, holding a candle, performs rituals on the positions set on the table. An old man is dressing the bodies lined up in a row with cloth socks. Then he neatly places them one by one into bamboo baskets.
1:19:54|1:20:4|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] rode into the village on horseback and remarked upon seeing ashes everywhere.
1:20:6|1:20:27|His colleague looked around and replied. The air was filled with the choking residue of the fire, and the village was scattered with collapsed bricks and tiles. At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] passed by the wooden pavilion and saw women kneeling by the bamboo baskets, crying sorrowfully. He even saw the charred bodies in the bamboo baskets after being burned by the fire.
1:20:45|1:21:2|[Xu Baijiu]'s colleague asked impatiently. Suddenly, [Liu Jinxi] appeared in front of them. [Xu Baijiu] stared at [Liu Jinxi] and exclaimed loudly. Then, [Liu Jinxi] limped towards [Xu Baijiu].
1:21:2|1:21:17|[Xu Baijiu] saw the situation and gently swayed his body, then tightened the reins in his hand. At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] had already walked up to him. Then he spoke. [Xu Baijiu] swallowed his saliva and remained silent.
1:21:18|1:21:23|Xu Baijiu's colleague sat on the horse, asking in surprise.
1:21:41|1:21:57|With a large group of people leaving the village, only [Xu Baijiu] and [Liu Jinxi] were left behind in an instant. Seeing [Liu Jinxi] staring at him, [Xu Baijiu] awkwardly smiled. On the other side, the villagers of the whole village carried hoes and bundles on their backs.
1:21:57|1:22:16|Slowly moving towards Tianzhai. In the crowd, [A Yu] and Fang Zheng led Xiaotian up the steps one by one, following the main force. However, [Liu Jinxi] and [Xu Baijiu] came to the riverside. [Xu Baijiu] sat on the ground, burning paper and asking.
1:22:18|1:22:31|[Liu Jinxi] lowered his head, looking at the flames, and calmly replied. [Xu Baijiu] looked at [Liu Jinxi] mockingly, only to find his expression very serious, then [Liu Jinxi] nodded.
1:22:32|1:22:40|In an instant, [Xu Baijiu] widened his eyes and stared straight at him.
1:22:50|1:22:58|[Xu Baijiu] stopped burning the paper, disagreed with [Liu Jinxi], and then picked up a branch to draw on the ground.
1:23:7|1:23:17|Xu Baijiu was drawing the human body structure on the ground, describing his entire plan for Liu Jinxi.
1:24:5|1:24:11|At this moment, the villagers have arrived at Tianzhai, but the members of the Seventy-Two Demons have also arrived.
1:24:22|1:24:39|The seventy-two Earth Fiends rode on horseback with long swords, forming a cavalry, crossing over a hill. The hooves of the horses brushed past the mud on the slope, kicking up clouds of dust. And right in front of them, Xu Baijiu was pushing a cart along with his colleagues.
1:24:39|1:24:57|Seeing the opponent getting closer and closer, he lifted the cloth on the flatbed cart and pressed it hard against [Liu Jinxi]'s neck. Sensing the danger, colleagues who were following [Xu Baijiu] quickly rode away on horses. At this moment, [Sect Leader] led the seventy-two Earth Fiends to surround [Xu Baijiu] and the flatbed cart in the middle.
1:24:57|1:25:11|Seeing nearly twenty people surrounding him, [Xu Baijiu] frowned and said, but [Sect Leader] ignored him and instead stared intently at the covered [Liu Jinxi] on the flatbed truck.
1:25:12|1:25:29|Next, he dismounted and walked straight to [Xu Baijiu]. He lifted the cloth with force, and when [Xu Baijiu] saw that it was indeed [Liu Jinxi], his hand holding the cloth trembled slightly. Then he covered [Liu Jinxi]'s neck with his palm, as if verifying whether [Liu Jinxi] was truly dead.
1:25:29|1:25:32|In the end, he closed his eyes tightly.
1:25:34|1:25:44|Saying that, [Liu Jinxi] glared angrily at [Xu Baijiu], pointing at him fiercely with his hand. Seeing this, the colleague who was originally pulling the cart immediately abandoned [Xu Baijiu] and ran away.
1:25:44|1:25:55|At this moment, [Xu Kun] leaped onto the flatbed cart and squatted down. He lowered his head, staring fixedly at the face of [Liu Jinxi], then began to sing, as a way to mourn for [Liu Jinxi].
1:26:44|1:26:55|In the cold cave, the villagers huddled against the cave wall, looking at him. [Sect Leader] leisurely surveyed the faces of each villager, then spoke again.
1:27:1|1:27:21|Xiaotian looked curiously at the back of [Sect Leader] after hearing his own name. Before [A Yu] could stop him, [Sect Leader] suddenly turned around. On the other side, [Xu Kun]'s mourning continued. After singing the song, he scattered a handful of rice into the air. Then, the seventy-two Earth Fiend members repeated the same action.
1:27:21|1:27:35|They showered around Liu Jinxi with a rain of rice grains. Just as the watch was about to point to the peak, Xu Baijiu flipped and jumped onto the flatbed truck, delivering heavy punches to Liu Jinxi's chest first, then grabbing his neck.
1:27:35|1:27:54|At this point, [Liu Jinxi]'s eyelids had already swollen, and he lay back heavily. So [Xu Baijiu] repeated the action of hitting his chest again. The more he hit, the more intense it became. [Xu Baijiu] simply straddled [Liu Jinxi]'s legs and used both fists to pound on him alternately, but the person beneath him showed no response at all.
1:27:54|1:28:6|[Xu Baijiu] slumped back weakly, sitting on the flatbed cart, then stood back up on the ground to the astonishment of all seventy-two Earthly Fiends.
1:28:6|1:28:22|Suddenly, [Liu Jinxi] took a deep breath, then coughed forcefully, twisting his body into a ball on the flatbed to ease the repeated heavy blows to his chest. Seeing [Liu Jinxi] waking up, [Xu Baijiu] grinned happily.
1:28:22|1:28:38|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] propped himself up with both arms and sat up unsteadily. Seeing the joyful [Xu Baijiu] in front of him catching his breath, he smiled at him. Xu Kun, who was originally five steps away from [Liu Jinxi], hurriedly rode his horse to his side.
1:28:39|1:28:53|[Liu Jinxi] only then noticed the scene around him. Facing the sunlight, he saw familiar faces from the past seventy-two Earthly Fiends. At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] bent down to examine [Liu Jinxi] and then joyfully howled towards the sky.
1:28:53|1:29:7|The people around also showed joyful expressions. Hearing the laughter of [Xu Baijiu], [Liu Jinxi] also smiled, then slowly turned his head to face him. Suddenly, the smile on [Liu Jinxi]'s face disappeared.
1:29:7|1:29:22|After lowering his eyes and turning his head, he forcefully tapped his left shoulder, pulled out Xu Baijiu's broadsword, stood up, and chopped off his own left arm. The sudden movement left Xu Baijiu and the constable stunned on the spot.
1:29:22|1:29:41|Liu Jinxi, due to blood loss and prolonged unconsciousness, knelt on the stretcher. Liu Jinxi supported his trembling body and locked eyes with Xu Baijiu. Then, he collapsed directly onto the armrest.
1:29:43|1:29:51|Xu Baijiu quickly stepped forward to embrace his body, looked around, and hurriedly picked up the cloth to wrap around his exposed left shoulder.
1:29:57|1:30:5|Watching [Liu Jinxi] self-harming, [Xu Baijiu] angrily shouted at him.
1:30:14|1:30:21|Soon after, [Xu Baijiu] bent down and said to [Liu Jinxi].
1:30:28|1:30:44|After that, [Xu Baijiu] quickly rode away with the seventy-two Earth Fiends. Upon hearing this news, [Liu Jinxi] furrowed his brows and widened his eyes in an instant. Then, with the help of [Xu Baijiu], he struggled to stand up from the flatbed cart.
1:30:45|1:30:53|The scene shifts, [Liu Jinxi] is slowly walking through the woods towards home, his left shoulder, wrapped in bandages, still oozing blood.
1:31:47|1:32:3|Xiaotian sat in the arms of [Sect Leader], and when he saw [Liu Jinxi] come to the table, he called out in joy. The [Sect Leader], who had been looking down at Xiaotian, looked up and saw the one-armed [Liu Jinxi] sitting across from him with a big knife in hand.
1:32:5|1:32:21|[Sect Leader] extended two fingers, pointing at the left shoulder of [Liu Jinxi], his voice so loud that Xiaotian sitting in front of him hurriedly covered his ears. Then [Liu Jinxi] spoke. After listening, [Sect Leader] slowly lowered the two fingers pointing at [Liu Jinxi].
1:32:21|1:32:31|The muscles on his face, which were trembling with anger, gradually calmed down. Then he looked at [A Yu] and Fang Zheng, nodded, and said.
1:32:56|1:33:10|The Sect Leader picked up a piece of food for Xiaotian in his arms, then pursed his lips and asked A Yu directly. A Yu trembled and nodded. After listening, A Yu quickly lowered his head, almost crying.
1:33:55|1:34:19|[Sect Leader] kicked [A Yu] directly, sending him flying into the corner, while [Liu Jinxi] tightly gripped the handle of the knife. [Sect Leader] held Xiaotian in front of him, shaking his small body in the air, then pressed the back of his head against his own shoulder, glanced at [Liu Jinxi], and said with a lowered head.
1:34:48|1:35:4|[Sect Leader] was telling the story to Xiaotian, but he kept staring at [Liu Jinxi] and holding Xiaotian tightly in his arms. Remembering the past days, [Sect Leader] burst into laughter, while [Liu Jinxi] held the knife handle in his right hand, looking at the laughing [Sect Leader].
1:35:4|1:35:16|The corners of his mouth twitched, but the tip of the knife was firmly embedded in the ground. At this moment, the smile on [Sect Leader]'s face turned sinister, even his features squeezed together, then he continued speaking.
1:35:42|1:36:2|[Sect Leader] gritted his teeth and stared at [Liu Jinxi] intensely, tears swirling in his eyes. But [Liu Jinxi] remained unmoved, looking straight at him and saying, [Sect Leader] froze, then slowly glanced at [Liu Jinxi]'s left shoulder. After hearing that, [Sect Leader] trembled and averted his gaze.
1:36:2|1:36:10|Then he slowly lowered his head and looked at Xiaotian in his arms. At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] eyes were shining as he gazed firmly at the [Sect Leader].
1:36:11|1:36:17|Rainwater dripped from the roof, hitting [Liu Jinxi] on the wrist holding the knife handle.
1:36:21|1:36:30|Realizing what it meant, [Liu Jinxi] widened his eyes.
1:36:38|1:36:48|After roaring, [Sect Leader] grabbed Xiaotian by the waist with one hand and lifted him into the air. Seeing [Liu Jinxi] rushing towards him with a big knife, he twisted his wrist and forcefully slammed Xiaotian head down.
1:36:49|1:36:56|As they were about to hit the ground, [Liu Jinxi] used the back of the knife to catch the falling forearm of [Sect Leader], leaving Xiaotian hanging upside down in mid-air.
1:36:57|1:37:14|Shortly after, he flicked his wrist, and with a quick slash of the blade, [Sect Leader] immediately shook off Xiaotian. [A Yu] hurriedly caught him and rolled into a corner. At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] swung horizontally towards [Sect Leader], who dodged it, and then [Liu Jinxi] used the knife to push Fang Zheng into the nearby bedroom.
1:37:14|1:37:34|Then he knelt on the dining table with one leg, wielding the big knife to strike towards [Sect Leader] from left to right. Unexpectedly, he didn't land a single hit, but was instead supported by [Sect Leader] with one hand, and received a straight kick to the neck. After collapsing the dining table, [Liu Jinxi] quickly got up, swinging the big knife, forcing [Sect Leader] towards the door. What shocked everyone was,
1:37:34|1:37:40|After the blade struck the arm of [Sect Leader], not only was he unscathed, but he also sent [Liu Jinxi] flying out.
1:37:41|1:37:55|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] braved the heavy rain and quietly arrived near [Liu Jinxi]'s house. Inside the house, after knocking [Liu Jinxi] away, [Sect Leader] spread his arms wide and smiled at him. [Liu Jinxi] was panting heavily, holding the big knife horizontally in front of his chest.
1:37:55|1:38:9|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] arrived outside the kitchen, saw the cellar, lifted the wooden board and went down. Inside the room, [Liu Jinxi] once again swung the big knife towards [Sect Leader], suddenly he crouched down, the blade slanted upwards, directly hitting the side waist of [Sect Leader].
1:38:10|1:38:27|Just like last time, not only did he not harm him at all, but he was also harshly pushed away by [Sect Leader] with a wave of his hand. Unconvinced, [Liu Jinxi] aimed at [Sect Leader]'s throat this time, but unexpectedly, [Sect Leader] lowered his head and firmly held the blade between his neck and chin.
1:38:27|1:38:32|Then, he swung the big knife with one hand and fiercely punched [Liu Jinxi]'s abdomen with the other hand.
1:38:33|1:38:46|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] was observing from below through the wooden boards, and then he took out a needle. On the other side, the hand of [Sect Leader] with many rings clenched tightly, and then a fierce punch landed on [Liu Jinxi]'s cheek.
1:38:47|1:39:1|Continuing, he struck [Liu Jinxi]'s chest again, causing him to crash through two door panels and fall to the ground with the knife. Seizing the opportunity, [Xu Baijiu] threaded a needle through the gap in the wood and directly pierced the bare foot of [Sect Leader].
1:39:2|1:39:6|The Sect Leader unexpectedly shattered the wooden board with his bare hands, then grabbed Xu Baijiu and pulled him up.
1:39:8|1:39:15|Next, [Xu Baijiu] took the opportunity to insert three needles into the neck of [Sect Leader], and was then grabbed by the neck and thrown out of the room.
1:39:16|1:39:24|Then [Sect Leader] slowly turned around, looking at [Xu Baijiu] lying on the ground, with a forceful push of his shoulder, he directly shook the needle flying out.
1:39:26|1:39:40|At this moment, [A Yu] hurriedly ran to the second floor with a frightened Xiao Tian. Hearing the sound of footsteps on the stairs, [Sect Leader] shifted his gaze to the back. Just as [A Yu] locked the door and turned to enter the room with Xiao Tian, [Sect Leader] grabbed her with one hand through the door panel.
1:39:40|1:39:53|Seeing [A Yu] holding Xiao Tian's clothes and not letting go, she quickly hugged the child and stepped back. As a result, [Sect Leader] directly pulled the two of them and tore the door panel. [A Yu] fainted on the spot because she was protecting Xiao Tian.
1:39:54|1:40:8|Finally, [Liu Jinxi] regained his senses, picked up the big knife and leaped forward, flying to the front of [Sect Leader]. In the narrow corridor that only allowed one person to pass through, he kept swinging the big knife, forcing [Sect Leader] to move away from the mother and son.
1:40:8|1:40:21|At this moment, the blade of Liu Jinxi scraped across the dragon-shaped necklace on the chest of the Sect Leader, drawing the first drop of blood in their fight. Feeling the pain, he looked down at his chest, then raised his fists, facing Liu Jinxi directly.
1:40:22|1:40:32|[Liu Jinxi] swung the knife, but it was caught and kicked away by his opponent. Then, a kick in mid-air forced [Liu Jinxi] to retreat repeatedly.
1:40:33|1:40:52|Later, the two separated on either side of the corridor, assuming the same posture and attacking each other. [Liu Jinxi] slightly bent his five fingers and swiftly struck towards the top of [Sect Leader]'s head and abdomen, but one fist was no match for two palms. After [Sect Leader] pushed aside [Liu Jinxi]'s arm with his left hand, he clenched his right hand into a fist and directly swung it at his face.
1:40:52|1:40:59|Next, [Liu Jinxi] lowered his body and lunged towards [Sect Leader], but not only did he fail, he was also flipped over and forcefully struck on the left shoulder.
1:41:0|1:41:19|Later, [Sect Leader] opened his palm and firmly grasped the severed arm of [Liu Jinxi], the pain causing him to immediately buckle his knees and slowly bend over. Despite this, [Sect Leader] did not release his grip. Thick blood continued to flow from the wound. Eventually, [Sect Leader] let him go.
1:41:19|1:41:27|Continuing to relentlessly attack Liu Jinxi's neck, then kicking him away.
1:41:39|1:41:48|After speaking, [Sect Leader] raised his foot and kicked [Liu Jinxi] onto the platform on the second floor. The heavy rain hit [Liu Jinxi]'s face, wiping away the blood at the corner of his mouth.
1:41:49|1:42:2|Seeing [Liu Jinxi] struggling to get up, [Sect Leader] bent down and stepped onto the platform from the house. After walking up to him, he forcefully kicked towards his cheek, causing [Liu Jinxi] to fall directly into the vegetable garden on the first floor.
1:42:22|1:42:36|Just as [Sect Leader] was about to use his thumb joint to strike at the temple of [Liu Jinxi], [Xu Baijiu] jumped onto him and jabbed a needle into his neck. As a result, the punch that was originally meant for [Liu Jinxi] was delivered straight to [Xu Baijiu].
1:42:36|1:42:41|A sudden bolt of lightning struck down from the sky, heading straight towards [Sect Leader].
1:42:42|1:42:50|The person who was laughing suddenly had his head blown open, falling forward horizontally, landing directly facing [Liu Jinxi].
1:42:51|1:42:59|[Liu Jinxi] looked up at him, who was smoking, then suddenly lost strength, leaned his head against the muddy ground, and closed his eyes.
1:42:59|1:43:18|On the other side, Xu Baijiu, who was thrown by Sect Leader, lay paralyzed next to the sack in front of the house. He tugged at the corner of his mouth and followed his gaze. There was a clear iron needle on the burnt sole of Sect Leader's foot, in addition to the needle just on his neck, which explained why he was struck by lightning.
1:43:19|1:43:36|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] turned his head again, looked at [Liu Jinxi], and the two of them smiled at each other, finally letting go of their worries. The heavy rain continued to pour down, but they paid no attention to their soaked bodies, simply closing their eyes slowly. Then [Xu Baijiu] slowly turned his head back.
1:43:37|1:43:44|In front of him appeared the doppelganger. The doppelganger was holding an umbrella, dressed neatly, and looking down at him.
1:43:45|1:44:0|Suddenly, [Xu Baijiu] felt a sweet and fishy sensation in his throat. In an instant, a sticky fresh blood flowed from the corner of his mouth. It was only then that he saw clearly that on his once clean clothes, blood was continuously gushing out from his lung area.
1:44:1|1:44:10|With the rhythm of his breathing, blood was flowing continuously from the corners of his mouth, staining his clothes in front of him.
1:44:16|1:44:35|The case finally came to light, and [Xu Baijiu] thought to himself. His doppelganger, holding an umbrella, stood in front of him, silently shedding tears. After sniffing, he smiled and nodded at him. Then [Xu Baijiu] slowly closed his eyes that had been forcibly held open.
1:44:35|1:44:55|The glasses were gradually blurred by the rain, and seeing him like this, [Liu Jinxi] forcefully opened his eyes wet by the rain, and then weakly closed them again. And so, accompanied by the heavy rain, [Sect Leader], [Liu Jinxi], and [Xu Baijiu] maintained their lying, sitting, and leaning positions for a long time.
1:44:56|1:45:18|The scene shifts, and at this moment, the mosquito coil from the beginning of the film reappears. After the mosquito coil burns through the rope, the sound of the small iron ball dropping at the other end of the rope awakens [Liu Jinxi]. Subsequently, [Liu Jinxi] finishes washing up, picks up a jug of wine, pours three cups in front of the altar, and facing the flickering candlelight, he raises his right hand to his chest and bows deeply.
1:45:18|1:45:34|Shortly after, he arrived at the tool room, took the file out of the water basin, and shook off the water. Xiaotian hurried over, first spread out the towel, then wrapped his hands around the file to dry it, and finally, [Liu Jinxi] inserted the file into the cowhide cloth.
1:45:41|1:45:58|Seeing Xiaotian eating voraciously, [A Yu] whispered a reminder. After the meal, [Liu Jinxi] picked up the cowhide cloth with a file in it, put it in his backpack, and walked towards the woods. [A Yu], who was originally washing dishes in the kitchen, hurriedly caught up and stopped him.
1:45:59|1:46:6|[Liu Jinxi] turned around upon hearing this, blinked at [A Yu], and then [A Yu] cleared his throat and said.
1:46:7|1:46:16|After speaking, [A Yu] stared straight into the eyes of [Liu Jinxi]. Upon hearing this, [Liu Jinxi] was momentarily stunned, then glanced at Xiao Tian playing in the vegetable garden behind her.
1:46:17|1:46:26|Then he pursed his lips, blinked his eyes, and smiled at her. He then turned around, picked up his straw hat, and walked towards the depths of the forest.
