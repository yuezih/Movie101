0:1:45|0:2:3|Above the Nine Heavens, a building resembling a huge lotus flower stands tall in the sea of clouds. Two celestial horses flap their wings in the air, pulling a luxurious carriage adorned with carved flowers and embroidery. Fairy maidens holding lanterns stand on both sides of the heavenly street, while a celestial master bows and pays respect below the stage, as the Clear Immortal of the Heaven and Earth Sect, Lotus, speaks.
0:2:27|0:2:47|The Heavenly Emperor smiled faintly, lowered the sedan curtain. The Heavenly Horse soared into the sky and disappeared in an instant. Below the thick layers of clouds, lies the border city of Hudu in the prosperous Tang Dynasty in the west. Fields of wheat spread outside the city, connecting thousands of acres. The sky darkened, and crows cawed on the shoulders of scarecrows.
0:2:47|0:2:55|Suddenly, a crow flew up and circled low in the sky. The farmer who was busy cutting wheat seemed to sense something and looked back fearfully.
0:3:2|0:3:21|Next to him, Uncle Zhang was just about to look up when he was knocked down by a monster. A long claw reached out to his chest and sucked away his soul. Dozens of tall, human-shaped monsters with long claws appeared in the wheat field - the Mountain Sweepers. In just a few steps, they caught up with the panicked farmers, waving their sharp claws to tear open their bellies.
0:3:22|0:3:42|In the realm of demons, magma flows everywhere, black clouds gather above a mountain range where flames soar into the sky. On a stone platform resembling a tree crown, there is an open treasure chest emitting faint rays of light. Outside the cave is a suspended bridge, where a dozen or so cloaked figures, each holding a lamb's soul resembling a flame, line up to cross the bridge.
0:3:43|0:3:52|A man with empty hands quietly followed at the end of the team, this person is [Zhong Kui], with thick black eyebrows, round eyes, and a full beard on his face.
0:3:52|0:4:4|He looked around vigilantly, under the bridge was a deep pit illuminated by firelight, with boiling magma at the bottom. On the stone pillars and cliffs below the bridge, there were several mountain monkeys climbing upwards. The team ascended the towering hill.
0:4:5|0:4:23|The gatekeeper is a three-eyed mountain beast, carefully observing each person in the team. [Zhong Kui] quickly catches up with the team and enters the cave where the treasure box is placed. People in cloaks then put the sheep souls in their hands into the treasure box one by one, and the demons in the box instantly absorb the souls.
0:4:23|0:4:31|The gatekeeper of [Mount San Yan] was on watch, completely unaware of the presence of outsiders in the team. [Zhong Kui] walked up to the treasure chest pretending, and his eyes widened as he saw the demon spirit.
0:4:32|0:4:50|[Zhong Kui] saw that no one was behind him, immediately placed the night pearl in his hand on the stone platform, and tucked the treasure box into his arms. He ran with the treasure box in his arms. As he walked out of the cave, he carefully crouched down and crawled under the legs of the [Three-eyed Monster] who had his back turned to him.
0:4:50|0:4:59|[Mount Sanyan] The grass still low growled, watching around without any awareness. [Zhong Kui] held his breath and passed through the crowd outside the cave, but was noticed by a giant lizard.
0:5:0|0:5:9|The giant lizard spread out the scattered membrane around its neck and crawled towards [Zhong Kui]. [Zhong Kui] passed through the crowd and suddenly spat out a silk thread to pull off the cloak on [Zhong Kui]'s body.
0:5:9|0:5:32|[Zhang Daoxian] exposed the treasure box, and in a panic, turned around. The cloak monsters transformed into lava-like mountain demons and charged towards him. Sensing the danger from the demon realm outside, [Zhang Daoxian] immediately perceived the threat. [Zhong Ling] ran frantically on the stone bridge with the treasure box in his left hand, while the [Three-eyed Mountain Demon] behind him pushed aside the obstructing little demons and pounced on him. [Zhang Daoxian] shot out a beam of light from his hand.
0:5:32|0:5:48|The beam of light passed through the hole and wrapped around [Zhong Kui], lifting him into the air. The giant claws of [Three-Eyed Hanging] scraped across [Zhong Kui]'s chest. [Zhong Kui] was pulled back to [Zhang Daoxian]'s side by the beam of light. Xi Yi looked up and stood up, transforming into a stunning beauty.
0:5:48|0:6:2|Zhang Daoxian felt gratified as he touched the treasure box. Xue Qing rushed to the edge of the drawbridge, only to see two dots of light flying towards the sky, drawing an arc of light in the horizon. He quickly flew back to the solitary mountain where the lava flows converged, arriving at a frozen cave.
0:6:7|0:6:24|The ice layer in the cave cracked slightly, and on the rocky mountain surrounded by conglomerate, the throne of the withered dragon was placed. A black mist descended from the sky, with the [Demon King] sitting steadily on the throne, sucking in the precious energy of Danxi, holding a short knife. The [Demon King] reached out and absorbed the short knife.
0:6:43|0:6:47|[The Demon King] raised his hand to reject the request of the Lizard Spirit, and instead turned to look at the frozen cave behind him.
0:6:56|0:7:17|In the palm of the [Demon King], a blazing fire burst out, instantly melting the ice layer. In the cave, among thousands of ice spikes, lay a frosty beauty. She was dressed in a shoulder-revealing long dress with repeated patterns, her eyes and brows mossy, revealing a cold and stunning face. The title appears, "Zhong Kui Demon Slayer," with [Xue Qing] as the demonic spirit.
0:7:17|0:7:20|The bustling city is filled with people coming and going in the streets of Huducheng.
0:7:25|0:7:36|In the crowd, a cloth banner suddenly rose, with the words "Protect Poling" written on it. [Du Ping] held the banner and shouted while walking in circles among the crowd, and the pedestrians quickly made way for him.
0:8:20|0:8:28|[Du Ping] took the package of medicine handed to him by someone nearby. Suddenly, the burly man behind Du Ping spoke up.
0:8:51|0:9:14|The burly man called over a woman with an impressive figure, [Du Ping] frowned when he saw her. [Du Ping] patted the burly man. [Du Ping] tried to slip away, but was held down by Brother Xiong. Brother Xiong's wife voluntarily reached out her wrist, but [Du Ping] reached out and touched Brother Xiong's body, which made Brother Xiong unhappy.
0:9:17|0:9:40|[Du Ping] suddenly grabbed Bear Brother's lower body, and Bear Brother closed his eyes and endured the pain. Bear Brother chased after [Du Ping], but was blocked by a woman.
0:10:5|0:10:27|[Zhong Ling], [Du Ping], and Xiao Wei ran back to the mansion together. The mansion of the Zhong family had a grand entrance and courtyard, with several wooden dummies for martial arts practice. [Zhong Kui] muttered to himself in his dream. Suddenly, [Zhang Daoxian] appeared.
0:10:35|0:10:37|[Zhang Daoxian] lowered his eyes.
0:11:28|0:11:44|[Zhong Kui] is all smiles, but [Zhong Ling] furrows her brow with worry. The thousand-foot white painting points to the sky, reaching up to the heavenly court. At the top of the tree canopy, a fairy pavilion suddenly appears in the clouds. The tree trunk extends into mid-air islands below the pavilion, and a beam of light falls on the open space in front of the pavilion.
0:11:51|0:12:0|[Zhang Daoxian] brought [Zhong Kui] to the fairy pavilion, which was decorated with gold on all sides, magnificent and splendid. Looking at the well with swimming fish in it, [Zhang Daoxian] raised his head and said.
0:12:19|0:12:30|The thunder roared, and the scene shifted to a year ago. The door was kicked open, and [Zhong Kui] and several demon hunters burst in. A pregnant woman in labor was struggling on the bed, suddenly sat up and roared.
0:12:32|0:12:48|The demon slayer stepped forward as ordered, but was knocked down by the pregnant woman with a slap. The others rushed up to temporarily restrain her. The Green Dragon woman outside heard the commotion and crowded in. [Zhong Kui] looked at the pregnant woman on the bed, who was raging like a wild beast, and threw a handful of soybeans at her.
0:12:48|0:13:7|The pregnant woman's body touched the soybeans and emitted bursts of smoke, she trembled and gradually calmed down. Her lips turned pale, gasping for breath heavily. The women outside the door listened to the movement, [Zhong Kui] half-knelt in front of the pregnant woman, stroking her belly, which suddenly became uneven.
0:13:7|0:13:12|[Zhang Guo] looked at the pregnant woman without changing his expression. The pregnant woman was sweating profusely, but her expression had softened considerably.
0:13:13|0:13:29|She looked up at her belly, then slowly shifted her gaze to [Zhong Kui]'s face. [Zhong Kui] grinned, and the pregnant woman also showed a gentle smile. [Zhong Kui] wrinkled his nose like teasing a cat, and the pregnant woman even stuck out her tongue to lick her lips.
0:13:29|0:13:48|The pregnant woman with sharp teeth in her mouth suddenly pounced on [Zhong Kui], with nine tiger tails emerging from her body. The nine-tailed fox revealed its true form and bit down on [Zhong Kui]'s sword. The pregnant woman fainted on the bed, [Zhong Kui] drew his sword and slashed the fox's head twice, unexpectedly the nine-tailed fox grew two more heads from the split, with the middle fox head knocking [Zhong Kui]'s sword down.
0:13:48|0:13:57|Just as she was about to jump, [Zhong Kui] kicked her into the wooden cabinet against the wall. She used the "exposing the waist" move to knock down the cabinet cover on the nine-tailed fox, but the fox inside the cabinet caused chaos in the room.
0:13:58|0:14:12|Xue Qing steadied the wooden cabinet with one foot, holding the sword above it with both hands, closing his eyes to sense the movement of the Nine-Tailed Fox. His face and the blade were covered in flowing blood. Suddenly, he thrust the sword down, causing the cabinet to split into four pieces.
0:14:13|0:14:30|The nine-tailed fox leaped up, but its tail was stuck to the ground by a sword. Zhang Daoxian quickly stepped forward to hold down the sword and jumped up to cut the fox's tail, [Zhong Kui] picked up the sword on the ground, smirked evilly as he walked up to the nine-tailed fox, and chopped off the three fox heads with a single stroke.
0:14:30|0:14:42|The door opens, and the heavily made-up women scatter around the doorway. [Zhong Kui], covered in blood but unharmed, strides out with a sword in one hand and a fox tail in the other. As the flashback ends, [Zhang Daoxian] instructs [Zhong Kui].
0:14:53|0:14:59|Zhong Kui hurriedly knelt down, and [Zhang Daoxian] took out a carved magic fan from his wide sleeve.
0:15:4|0:15:11|Zhong Kui quickly reached out his hand, and [Zhang Daoxian] opened the magic fan. The fan bones were sharp, and the fan surface looked like clouds and mist.
0:15:29|0:15:41|[Zhang Daoxian] used the magic fan to cut a mouth in [Zhong Kui]'s hand. [Zhang Daoxian] unfolded the magic fan, with [Zhong Kui]'s palm facing down, and evenly dripped his blood on the fan surface, a force bursting out in [Zhong Kui]'s body.
0:15:47|0:16:6|His body gradually expanded, turning into a muscular black giant covered in lava-like skin with cracks oozing ancient magma. [Zhong Kui] stood on a lotus bamboo platform nearly three times his height, dazedly observing his new body in front of [Zhang Daoxian].
0:16:15|0:16:29|[Zhang Guolao] had two inverted hooks growing at his ankles, and he staggered to the nearby fish tank and looked down. His reflection had a dark complexion, with three dazzling cracks on his forehead, resembling a demon.
0:16:29|0:16:40|He was scared to the ground, then flipped and stood up, leaped several feet high out of nowhere, and awkwardly fell heavily in a strange posture. [Zhang Daoxian] saw this and walked slowly to his side.
0:16:44|0:16:49|[Zhong Kui] immediately bounced up, collided with the door frame, and then fled in a panic regardless of the pain.
0:17:9|0:17:20|Through the dust and fog, the continuous mountains can be seen. [Zhong Kui] is climbing on the steep cliff, almost falling. Soon, he moves agilely on the cliff like a monkey in the mountains, climbing and jumping.
0:17:28|0:17:34|[Zhong Kui] climbed along the dangerous cliff to the edge of the cliff, then turned around and leaped to stand firmly on the hanging rock at the edge of the cliff.
0:17:38|0:17:59|He looked down at the valley from here, with the beautiful scenery all in sight. [Zhong Ling] was leaping and jumping in the tea garden, with several wild rabbits hidden under the tea bushes. He scattered flowers in the air, spinning and landing again, causing the rabbits to scatter like splashing water. [Zhong Ling] arrived at the base of the mountain waterfall, leaping onto the abrupt cliff rock at the mouth of the waterfall.
0:18:0|0:18:16|He leaped around the cascading waterfall like a child, blinking and jumping onto rocks twice his height, as light as a feather. The scenery here is unique, with towering mountains competing with each other, and a solitary peak with varying sizes, the summit of which is a flat land.
0:18:16|0:18:23|[Zhong Kui] has transformed back into human form and is practicing at the peak. He blows off the sand and stones in his palm, then performs a low sweep kick.
0:18:36|0:18:46|Daoxian Zhang opened the iron fan, [Zhong Kui] transformed into a black giant, rushing towards the huge rock at the cliff edge. With a flying punch, he smashed the side of the huge rock, and after a few punches, more than half of the rock was smashed off.
0:18:49|0:18:54|He caught the fan thrown by Zhang Daoxian, and with a spark, it transformed back to its original form.
