0:3:2|0:3:20|The film begins with the slowly opening European-style large iron gate adorned with flowers. Inside the gate is a European-style building, and a small car drives in from outside the gate. It passes through the yard filled with bouquets, with a security guard lifting a roadblock in front of the auditorium and directing the car forward with one hand, but the car does not stop.
0:3:20|0:3:38|The Maserati is parked outside the auditorium, the parking attendant is smiling and ready to greet guests, but the people in the car do not get out. Instead, they drive around the garden outside the auditorium in circles. The security guard picks up his hat, fanning himself while watching the car, and the parking attendant at the entrance furrows his brow.
0:3:48|0:4:4|The man sitting in the back of the car is [Xia Luo], he stretches his head and looks out, as if trying to find something through the glass. The security guard and the parking attendant both have unpleasant expressions while staring at this car. At this moment, [Xia Luo] sees a group of people coming out of the auditorium entrance, so he quickly tells his younger brother-in-law to stop.
0:4:4|0:4:12|At the entrance of the auditorium, two men and two women looked at the Maserati. The driver of the car got out and opened the door for [Xia Luo] in the back seat.
0:4:24|0:4:26|The departing car accidentally caught the hem of [Xia Luo]'s clothes.
0:5:20|0:5:29|Amidst everyone's mocking laughter, [Xia Luo] awkwardly smiled and sat down at his seat.
0:5:53|0:5:58|[Yuan Hua] raised a glass of red wine and invited [Xia Luo] to clink glasses with him, and both of them finished the wine in the glass in one gulp.
0:7:5|0:7:10|[Xia Luo] picked up a beer bottle, clinked glasses with [Teacher Wang], and drank it all in one gulp. At this moment, [Xia Luo]'s goddess [Qiu Ya] came to his table with the groom to toast.
0:7:20|0:7:28|Amidst the commotion, a plain-looking woman walked in and looked around.
0:7:57|0:8:2|The woman at the door is Xia Luo's wife [Ma Dongmei], she walks straight towards Xia Luo, and everyone turns to look at Ma Dongmei.
0:9:23|0:9:32|[Ma Dongmei] was about to help [Xia Luo] go home, but was pushed away by [Xia Luo].
0:11:24|0:11:32|Taking a deep breath, [Xia Luo] walked to the sink, turned on the tap, and plunged his entire head into the sink.
0:11:44|0:11:51|He raised his head and punched the mirror.
0:11:56|0:12:3|Perhaps due to drinking too much alcohol, [Xia Luo] started vomiting into the toilet, and eventually fell asleep hugging the toilet.
0:12:5|0:12:28|After who knows how long, [Xia Luo] woke up and found that the faucet in the bathroom couldn't be turned off, and the mirror was broken. He looked at himself in the mirror and said something. He opened the bathroom door, and a dazzling light shone towards him. He shielded his eyes with his arm, slowly raised his head, and what he saw in his pupils was the scene of a classroom.
0:12:28|0:12:41|[Xia Luo] stood still in shock, the door behind him slowly closing. He saw his classmates sitting neatly in the classroom. As he turned to leave, he heard the voice of Teacher Wang.
0:13:8|0:13:21|Amid the laughter of his classmates, he tightly closed his eyes and felt a dizzy spell. The classmates sat in front of their desks, showing their white teeth, mocking him. [Yuan Hua] pursed his lips, smiling ambiguously.
0:13:31|0:13:49|At this moment, [Xia Luo] not only did not listen to what the teacher said, but also slowly walked towards the middle of the classroom, casually touching his classmates' desks. The desks were filled with childhood memories, Slam Dunk stickers and a bottle of unforgettable. Under the gaze of all his classmates, he walked to the back row of the classroom.
0:13:49|0:13:59|He walked up to [Ma Dongmei], suddenly pinched her face, and Ma Dongmei hit his hand in pain.
0:15:1|0:15:14|Teacher Wang knocked the love letter out of Xia Luo's hand, causing the pages to scatter down. Enraged, Xia Luo instantly kicked Teacher Wang to the ground.
0:15:47|0:15:53|[Xia Luo] picked up a school bag and put it over [Teacher Wang]'s head from behind, causing chaos in the classroom.
0:15:56|0:16:13|[Yuan Hua] saw the situation and ran out of the classroom. When the classmates heard this, they all sat back in their original seats, except for [Da Chun], who ran to [Teacher Wang] and just lifted one foot. [Teacher Wang] took the backpack covering his face off.
0:16:16|0:16:47|Teacher Wang's glasses fell off in anger, closing his eyes and sitting paralyzed under the bookshelf. Xia Luo stared straight at Qiu Ya, raised an eyebrow, and walked straight down from the platform. At this moment, Qiu Ya also stood up. Xia Luo stood in front of Qiu Ya, and after a few seconds of eye contact, he hugged and kissed Qiu Ya. Qiu Ya pushed Xia Luo away.
0:16:50|0:16:56|[Qiu Ya] shyly buried her head in her arms, [Xia Luo] hugged [Qiu Ya], and just as they were about to continue, [Yuan Hua] walked in.
0:17:11|0:17:26|[Xia Luo] plunged into the basin next to the classroom, and in an instant, scenes that had just happened seemed to be right in front of him: [Teacher Wang] threw the love letter, [Qiu Ya]'s wedding, breaking the mirror in the bathroom, and so on. [Xia Luo] pulled himself out of the basin.
0:17:26|0:17:34|Finding himself still in the classroom, all the students were staring at him. Only [Qiu Ya] was crying with her hand covering her mouth, and he slapped himself a few times.
0:17:49|0:17:56|[Xia Luo] reaches out to [Zhang Yang], takes out a lighter from his pocket, and lights the textbook.
0:18:5|0:18:31|The flames instantly ignited the curtains in the classroom. The students were in chaos, taking out books to put out the fire. The principal even took out a bottle of ink and splashed it on the burning curtains. At this moment, Xia Luo's Mom rushed into the classroom. Xia Luo slowly turned his head and saw his mother coming in. He walked slowly towards her and suddenly knelt down, embracing her legs tightly.
0:18:59|0:19:13|After saying goodbye to [Xia Luo], he walked straight towards the back of the classroom. Just as he passed by [Qiu Ya], he turned back and kissed her on the cheek. Then he opened the window and jumped out.
0:19:17|0:19:24|Ma Dongmei, crouching downstairs, suddenly saw Xia Luo jumping out of the window, with a look of fear on his face, and the ice cream in his mouth also splattered all over his face.
0:19:26|0:19:37|After an unknown period of time, [Xia Luo] woke up in the hospital.
0:20:10|0:20:16|[Xia Luo] ran out of the hospital with bandages all over his body, limping, and even knocked over a nurse's medicine bottle.
0:20:43|0:20:50|Michael Jackson, Titanic, Three Gorges Dam scene,
0:21:48|0:22:4|At this moment, [Xia Luo] returned as if nothing had happened. The scene shifted to the school playground, where students were playing freely. Some students were chasing and playing on the steps, chatting with each other, playing football. In a secluded bush, [Da Chun] was lighting a cigarette for [Meng Tejiao] and [Zhang Yang].
0:23:10|0:23:18|A soccer ball hit [Qiu Ya].
0:23:44|0:23:54|[Xia Luo's Mom] puts down the cigarette in her hand, takes off the hairpin and puts it on the table, and unties the belt of her skirt.
0:24:57|0:25:17|[Xia Luo] walked to the front of the playground with a cane, making funny faces. He stood in front of the microphone, closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and said,
0:28:7|0:28:14|Teacher Wang had just left when Xia Luo picked up his textbook and walked over to Yuan Hua.
0:28:30|0:28:38|[Yuan Hua] walked towards the last row where [Xia Luo] was sitting, finally getting to sit next to [Qiu Ya] as he wished. Seeing this, [Ma Dongmei] also moved to a seat behind [Qiu Ya].
0:29:3|0:29:21|[Qiu Ya] picked up a pencil and drew a line, [Xia Luo] took the pencil from [Qiu Ya] and kept staring at him. [Ma Dongmei] got angry and pushed [Zhang Yang] off his seat, then sat behind [Xia Luo], staring at him while [Xia Luo] gazed affectionately at [Qiu Ya].
0:30:13|0:30:20|The bell rang after class, [Qiu Ya] quickly left, [Xia Luo] was about to catch up, but was stopped by [Ma Dongmei].
0:30:35|0:30:40|[Ma Dongmei] rushed out with joy on her face. On the other side of the school,
0:30:42|0:30:57|Qiu Ya was crying alone when Yuan Hua walked slowly towards her from behind. He looked up at Qiu Ya's back, and when Qiu Ya turned to look at him, she turned away. Yuan Hua punched a tree in anger.
0:31:18|0:31:23|[Yuan Hua] took the opportunity to move his face closer, but was dodged by [Qiu Ya].
0:32:15|0:32:22|Xia Luo's mom's good friend brought him a mirror, and at that moment Xia Luo returned.
0:32:34|0:32:41|[Xia Luo] stood in front of the mirror that his mother used to ward off evil spirits, and shook his bangs.
0:32:47|0:32:55|He returned to his room, turned off the recorder, and searched for the CD on the bookshelf.
0:32:56|0:33:8|He slowly lifted his head as if pondering something. He looked at the guitar on the wall.
0:33:12|0:33:15|[Xia Luo] excitedly picked up the guitar hanging on the wall and started playing.
0:33:15|0:33:33|Xia Luo's mom gestured to Auntie Wang to come over, and the two of them secretly observed Xia Luo's every move through the crack in the door. The melodious sound entered Xia Luo's mom's ears as Xia Luo skillfully plucked the strings, sitting on a chair in the room and singing along.
0:34:55|0:35:21|Time passed another day, a paper airplane flew through the school's rooftop. Only [Qiu Ya] stood alone on the rooftop. At this moment, [Yuan Hua] slowly walked over. [Qiu Ya] frowned when she saw [Yuan Hua], touched her small braid, lowered her head, and [Yuan Hua] pouted, tears in her eyes, asked:
0:36:49|0:37:13|[Qiu Ya] listened intently to the song, [Ma Dongmei] heard the singing and ran towards the broadcasting station. A female classmate at the station handed the microphone to [Xia Luo], who then started swaying. The entire school's teachers and students heard [Xia Luo]'s original song, with some students excitedly waving their hands to the beat. Suddenly, [Ma Dongmei] burst into the broadcasting station.
0:37:42|0:38:3|[Xia Luo], recommended by [Teacher Wang], participated in a singing competition with the song "Nunchucks". On stage, [Xia Luo] wore Bruce Lee's tight jumpsuit, singing and dancing energetically. He even kicked down a classmate holding a sign that said "Sick Man of East Asia". His nunchuck performance won cheers from the audience.
0:39:29|0:39:35|Qiu Ya took the soda bought by [Xia Luo] after speaking.
0:39:55|0:39:59|He suddenly found his bike locked to a pole,
0:40:18|0:40:27|[Xia Luo] watched helplessly as Dongmei took Qiu Ya away, his mouth twisted in anger.
0:42:15|0:42:29|Several gangsters surrounded [Xia Luo] in the arcade after finding him, slowly closing in on him.
0:43:57|0:44:27|Xia Luo threw away the stick in Ma Dongmei's hand, picked up a brick from the ground, smashed it towards Chen Kai's head, and then pulled Ma Dongmei to run. However, Ma Dongmei accidentally fell down. Xia Luo hurriedly turned back to protect Ma Dongmei with his body, but was then beaten up by the gangsters.
0:44:29|0:44:46|Teacher Wang happened to be riding a bike and saw this scene from the side. At the same time, Xia Luo, who was being beaten up, kept seeing images of Dongmei in his mind. He closed his eyes to completely block out Dongmei and didn't know how many kicks he had taken. At this moment, Teacher Wang appeared in time.
0:44:48|0:45:12|[Teacher Wang] knocked down one of the thugs with a series of punches, leaving several others writhing on the ground in pain. Slowly, [Teacher Wang] approached another thug standing nearby, pinching the flesh on his stomach. The thugs clutched their bellies and quickly fled.
0:45:12|0:45:28|Teacher Wang turned around to look at Chen Kai, ready to spar with him a few more rounds. However, Chen Kai pretended to be clueless and slipped away. Ma Dongmei helped Xia Luo up, and the two stood in front of Teacher Wang.
0:46:38|0:46:50|Dongmei watched as [Xia Luo] was about to cry, and [Xia Luo] turned around and threw the bag on the ground.
0:47:17|0:47:33|He threw the male classmate on the ground and slowly climbed the stairs while holding onto the handrail. At this moment, he met [Qiu Ya] who was coming down the stairs. Their eyes met, and [Ma Dongmei] showed a look of dissatisfaction. [Qiu Ya] said to [Ma Dongmei],
0:47:39|0:47:56|[Qiu Ya] smiled and walked down the stairs on the other side. [Yuan Hua] was playing basketball on the court with his classmates. His skilled ball handling tricked his classmate, and then he made a fancy move to accurately shoot the basketball into the hoop. The classmate was left stumbling and falling to the ground.
0:47:59|0:48:10|He stylishly brushed his bangs to the side, causing a group of girls next to him to scream. As the sound of the guitar started, the students watching the game all ran to the side, leaving [Xia Luo] playing the guitar.
0:48:11|0:48:18|[Ma Dongmei] walked towards [Xia Luo] in high heels, but accidentally sprained her foot.
0:48:19|0:48:26|She secretly played with her hair under the steps, watching Xia Luo sing, with classmates surrounding Xia Luo like stars around the moon.
0:48:59|0:49:2|Thinking of this, he immediately pulled out the clothes and covered the long johns.
0:49:17|0:49:30|[Xia Luo] seemed to have noticed him, so [Ma Dongmei] quickly covered her face with a sunflower. When [Xia Luo] saw the figure of [Qiu Ya], he threw away the guitar in his hand and chased after her, causing [Ma Dongmei] to accidentally drop a shoe.
0:49:58|0:50:8|[Xia Luo] placed the shoes behind [Ma Dongmei], startling her.
0:50:44|0:50:52|Ma Dongmei turned around at this moment, Xia Luo was so scared that he sat on the ground and swallowed hard.
0:51:1|0:51:14|Dongmei suddenly threw Xia Luo onto a big drum, knocking him unconscious, and they were blocked by someone.
0:51:45|0:51:57|Dongmei arrived at the entrance of the Blue Sea and Blue Sky KTV. She sneaked in with a hunched back, hiding a brick behind her. Once inside, she looked around cautiously and hid the brick whenever she saw someone.
0:52:3|0:52:9|The beauty turned her head and greeted [Xia Luo].
0:52:28|0:52:47|At the same time, Dongmei burst into a private room, awkwardly turned and left. [Xia Luo] stayed for a few seconds, then excitedly called out.
0:52:57|0:53:10|After hearing Xia Luo's voice, Ma Dongmei rushed in with a brick and smashed it directly on Naje's head. Naje fainted on the spot, Xia Luo, Ma Dongmei, and two bodyguards were all stunned. The scene then shifted to Ma Dongmei walking alone on the road with a backpack.
0:54:1|0:54:5|Teacher Wang complained to this group of graduating students.
0:54:23|0:54:32|Ma Dongmei went to Xia Luo's house after school. He knocked on the door, but no one answered. Feeling dejected, he walked downstairs and heard someone talking.
0:54:35|0:54:44|Ma Dongmei wanted to eavesdrop, but was caught by the gangsters. When she looked up, she saw her classmate [Yuan Hua] in front of her.
0:55:16|0:55:24|Chen Kai walked into Ma Dongmei with a sly smile on his face.
0:55:47|0:55:56|The gangsters all looked at [Ma Dongmei], and [Yuan Hua] slowly raised her head.
0:56:5|0:56:16|[Xia Luo] walked to the entrance of the alley, took off his earphones and glanced inside, but didn't see anything. Then he put his earphones back on and walked away.
0:56:17|0:56:32|Yuan Hua was just about to stop when he was kicked down by a thug, Ma Dongmei walked forward with heavy steps. Chen Kai followed behind him, with the screen playing the scene of Na Jie and Xia Luo performing on stage.
0:57:19|0:57:27|[Da Chun], [Meng Tejiao], and several classmates stood in front of the TV watching [Xia Luo]'s performance. [Xia Luo's Mom] and relatives watched their son on TV together.
0:58:1|0:58:17|Upon returning home, [Xia Luo] walked through the window glass, with a javelin piercing the sofa, and there was a letter on top of it.
0:58:46|0:59:8|[Ma Dongmei] walked towards the West Rainbow City station with her luggage. On the big screen above the station, Xia Luo's "Appointment 98" was playing. The scene shifted to after the college entrance examination, with [Yuan Hua] wearing a checkered shirt and a scarf around his neck to withstand the cold, making a phone call in a public phone booth covered with snow on top.
0:59:17|0:59:22|[Yuan Hua] lost his smile, froze in place, knelt down on both knees, and let out a long howl to the sky.
0:59:36|0:59:42|Meng Tejiao, wearing a school uniform, walks up from behind Xia Luo.
0:59:44|0:59:55|He looked at Yuan Hua in the snow, slowly took off his school uniform jacket, revealing another identical school uniform inside. He bent down and draped the uniform over Yuan Hua.
0:59:55|1:0:13|[Yuan Hua] frowned and glanced at him, raising his orchid finger to touch his temple. [Yuan Hua] and [Meng Tejiao] seemed to have forgotten each other for who knows how long, with a thick layer of snow accumulating on their bodies, the screen fades to black.
1:1:53|1:2:14|A Bentley is driving on the road, with [Xia Luo] lying in the car. At this moment, [Qiu Ya] calls, but [Xia Luo] takes out the phone battery and throws the phone to the back seat. The driver, [Zhang Yang], glances back.
1:2:22|1:2:31|[Xia Luo] tied a floral scarf on his head, surfing on a speedboat in the sea. A group of beautiful women in bikinis on the yacht waved to him.
1:2:34|1:2:51|[Xia Luo] went up to the second floor of the yacht and saw [Qiu Ya]. [Qiu Ya] was wearing sunglasses with a serious expression. She was sitting on the yacht with a table in front of her, on which there were melons and grapes.
1:3:38|1:3:46|[Xia Luo] hung up the phone and threw the mobile phone into the sea, [Qiu Ya] came out from behind, hugged [Xia Luo], and kissed him.
1:3:52|1:4:1|Without waiting for [Qiu Ya] to answer, the yacht suddenly shook violently, and a fishing boat on the sea collided with [Xia Luo]'s yacht.
1:4:1|1:4:18|[Xia Luo] and [Qiu Ya] went to the first floor of the yacht to check. [Yuan Hua], with a weary face, holding a harpoon in his hand and a cigarette in his mouth, sat on a small fishing boat. When he saw [Qiu Ya], he was so excited that his cigarette fell off. [Xia Luo] glanced at [Yuan Hua], then looked at [Qiu Ya].
1:4:18|1:4:40|Several people came to the edge of Xia Luo's swimming pool, Yuan Hua stared at Qiu Ya in the pool, he saw Qiu Ya as beautiful as a lotus flower, time seemed to be infinitely elongated at this moment.
1:4:43|1:4:51|[Yuan Hua] secretly glanced at [Qiu Ya] with her head down.
1:5:42|1:6:1|[Yuan Hua] looked at [Xia Luo] in surprise, then glanced at [Qiu Ya] and [Zhang Yang]. Everyone smiled at him slightly. [Yuan Hua] picked up a bottle of red wine, drank it all in one go, and placed the bottle on the table.
1:6:9|1:6:27|Everyone's faces suddenly froze, [Xia Luo] furrowed his brow, lost in thought.
1:7:22|1:7:29|[Xia Luo] poured himself a glass of wine from the table, leaving [Yuan Hua] feeling awkward and unsure of what to say.
1:7:42|1:7:51|[Xia Luo] suddenly flipped the table, and several people watched as [Xia Luo] walked away, looking at each other in silence. [Qiu Ya] let out a long sigh.
1:7:51|1:8:12|In the moonlight, [Xia Luo] stood alone in front of the French window, holding onto the window frame deep in thought. He then picked up a javelin by the window and gently caressed it in his hand.
1:8:33|1:8:42|Xia Luo walked towards an old man sitting at the door, as a car stopped by the roadside.
1:8:58|1:9:2|[Xia Luo] walked towards the second floor and heard the couple on the second floor arguing.
1:9:14|1:9:30|A man and a woman suddenly came out of the open door, [Xia Luo] then turned and walked away, hesitated for a moment before turning back.
1:9:52|1:10:15|[Xia Luo] closed the door of the couple and looked towards the window of the next room. At this moment, a voice suddenly came from behind. [Xia Luo] turned around and stared blankly at [Ma Dongmei]. [Ma Dongmei] accidentally knocked over the basin in her hand, and a basin of water happened to pour on the head of the old man downstairs who was enjoying the cool breeze.
1:10:15|1:10:31|In the moment when [Xia Luo] and [Ma Dongmei] locked eyes, time seemed to stand still. The clothes and sheets hanging between the buildings swayed gently in the breeze, while the sunlight illuminated this unremarkable residential building, making it shine brightly.
1:11:7|1:11:16|[Xia Luo] visits [Ma Dongmei]'s home and suddenly sees a brick on the cabinet.
1:11:44|1:11:55|[Xia Luo] lifted his head and used his hand to move the wind chime made of glass jars.
1:12:4|1:12:17|[Xia Luo] sat on the sofa, watching the scene of himself living with [Ma Dongmei] in the mirror.
1:12:53|1:13:8|[Xia Luo] stared at the bowl of noodles on the table, slowly reached out his hand, picked up the bowl, took the chopsticks, hesitated for a while before finally starting to eat ravenously.
1:13:11|1:13:21|[Ma Dongmei] sat on the side, watching the scene with a smile on her face.
1:13:42|1:13:54|Chewing on fennel noodles, tears unexpectedly streamed down his face as he set down his chopsticks and bowl.
1:14:45|1:15:7|[Xia Luo]'s memories flooded back. Once, [Ma Dongmei] rubbed her hands warm and comforted [Xia Luo] lying in bed. Unable to hold it in, [Xia Luo] let out a fart, and the two of them burst into laughter.
1:15:34|1:15:42|[Xia Luo] was scared and hid in [Ma Dongmei]'s arms, crying.
1:16:9|1:16:20|Just then, the door of [Ma Dongmei]'s house suddenly opened. [Ma Dongmei] wiped away the tears on her face and hurriedly ran towards the door.
1:18:4|1:18:20|[Da Chun] picked up the bowl of soup left by [Xia Luo] and drank it all in one gulp, [Ma Dongmei] tried to stop him but was too late, [Da Chun] wiped his mouth with his hand.
1:18:26|1:18:40|After leaving [Ma Dongmei]'s house, [Xia Luo] arrived at the KTV. He was surrounded by a group of beautiful women, some laughing loudly, some leaning on [Xia Luo]'s shoulder, some raising their glasses for a toast, living in a drunken dream, with singing and dancing in full swing.
1:19:35|1:20:6|[Xia Luo]'s press conference has started, with a group of reporters surrounding [Xia Luo]. [Qiu Ya] and [Zhang Yang] stand on both sides of [Xia Luo], everyone is smiling except [Xia Luo], who remains silent facing the reporters. Once he played the guitar, [Ma Dongmei] stood by holding a sign quietly listening. At home playing the guitar, [Ma Dongmei] dragged along beside him, with his favorite fennel braised noodles. At this moment, [Xia Luo] suddenly raised his left hand to signal everyone to be quiet.
1:20:6|1:20:25|[Zhang Yang] took out a lighter from his pocket, which was snatched away by [Xia Luo]. He lit the lighter, surprising both [Zhang Yang] and [Qiu Ya]. [Xia Luo] then threw the lit lighter behind him and walked towards the stage below the giant poster of himself, causing chaos.
1:20:46|1:21:6|After the poster burned fiercely, the scene of [Xia Luo] and [Ma Dongmei] at home appeared. [Xia Luo] made a promise to [Ma Dongmei] to plant a field of sunflowers. Driving a sports car, [Xia Luo] was ready to find his beloved. Suddenly, he saw a truck loaded with sunflowers ahead. He overtook the truck to block its path.
1:21:10|1:21:23|[Xia Luo] drove away the truck filled with sunflowers, while the driver stood next to the running car making a phone call. [Xia Luo] was driving the old truck.
1:21:29|1:21:51|[Xia Luo] angrily slapped the radio but to no avail. After kicking it a few times, the radio finally quieted down. [Da Chun], who was riding an electric bike on his way home, saw a truck full of sunflowers and stopped his bike by the roadside out of curiosity. When he saw that the driver was [Xia Luo], he smiled with joy.
1:22:12|1:22:18|[Da Chun] accidentally backed his electric bike into a large pothole on the side of the road.
1:22:30|1:22:37|At the entrance of the arcade, the two played King of Fighters. [Da Chun] made a series of moves and KO'd [Xia Luo].
1:22:49|1:22:54|[Xia Luo] smiled and lit a cigarette.
1:23:25|1:23:42|[Xia Luo] just dialed the phone when [Da Chun]'s phone rang. [Da Chun] turned around to answer the phone, and he raised his head blankly.
1:23:44|1:23:53|[Da Chun] put down his phone thoughtfully, turned around, and saw [Xia Luo] looking very distressed. He punched [Xia Luo] in the face.
1:23:54|1:24:3|[Xia Luo] was taken to the hospital. When friends saw the [doctor] coming out, they swarmed around.
1:24:36|1:24:41|[Qiu Ya] looked terrified and fainted.
1:25:6|1:25:19|Heavy rain poured down, [Da Chun] holding a helmet, getting wet in the rain, walking alone on the way home. Suddenly, he saw something lying on the road ahead. As he approached and took a closer look, he realized it was his damaged electric bike that had been hit.
1:25:29|1:25:38|In a European-style hospital building, [Xia Luo] is staying in a luxurious ward, lying on the hospital bed.
1:25:40|1:25:51|Xia Luo's Mom and [Zhang Yang] came to visit him with food, and his mom sat by the bed, expressing her worries.
1:26:0|1:26:14|Facing Xia Luo's gratitude, Zhang Yang turned away without saying a word, just waved his hand. Xia Luo's emotions started to crumble a little.
1:26:34|1:27:15|[Xia Luo] looked up at [Zhang Yang] with a mournful face. [Zhang Yang] turned around with a smug expression. Beside them, [Xia Luo's Mom] shyly lowered her head. [Xia Luo] grabbed the pole hanging next to him and chased after [Zhang Yang]. His mom intervened, propping the pole on the ground, causing [Zhang Yang] to panic as he jumped onto the bed and looked nervously at this mother-son duo.
1:27:26|1:27:49|As they left the ward, [Xia Luo] leaned on the pole, feeling dizzy. He touched his nose and some liquid flowed out. [Xia Luo] ran to the bed, frantically pulling out tissues to wipe away the nosebleed. Blood dripped in large patches onto the sheets from his nostrils.
