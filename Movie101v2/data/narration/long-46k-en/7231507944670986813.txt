0:1:18|0:1:36|In the misty sky, the entire city was shrouded in darkness. Sparse honking could be heard on the morning road. A woman in a military coat entered our view, pulling a dilapidated wooden cart. Loose screws indicated the worn-out condition of the cart, which was loaded with a stack of rough quality old cardboard.
0:1:37|0:1:49|Messily piled on the side of the cart, there was an abandoned plastic bottle pressed on top. The woman used both hands to pull the cart, moving slowly forward, step by step, leaving deep snow pits on the ground.
0:1:49|0:2:3|The road was lined with workers wrapped in thick scarves, diligently sweeping the ground with their heads down, raising dust that danced in the air. The woman pulling the cart took a glance, then continued on her path with determination.
0:2:3|0:2:15|Approaching deep winter, the cold air tightly envelops this land, bringing a heavy snowfall to the city. Every step the woman takes is on the snow, exhaling mist that condenses due to the cold.
0:2:15|0:2:24|The woman stopped in front of an old garbage bin, parked her car to the side, and half of her body leaned into the bin, trying to rummage through it to see if she could find anything valuable to sell.
0:2:28|0:2:52|At this moment, the cry of a baby caught the woman's attention. She held a cardboard box and looked around, searching for the source of the sound. The baby's cry grew closer, and the woman limped over to the side, where she found an old bamboo basket covered with a piece of cloth. In the icy snow, the woman uncovered the cloth, revealing a baby inside.
0:3:19|0:3:32|Red Yan flew to the south, the sun rose, and the vast sky silently watched over everything on the earth. In the swirling snowflakes, the woman trembled as she picked up the child in front of her, a loving smile on her face.
0:3:32|0:3:41|The child, so young yet possessing such strong vitality, disregarded the wooden cart beside her and walked a few steps in the snow, cradling the child in her arms.
0:3:42|0:4:1|She looked around for a long time as if searching for the person who had lost this child. The weather was so cold that every breath she exhaled turned into a mist in the air. The child in her arms was very sensible, not struggling, perhaps unaffected by the weather. Looking around, there was nothing but endless snowfields and silent building shadows.
0:4:1|0:4:6|Seeing no one around, [Han Shaofen] decides to take the child home and take care of him herself.
0:4:6|0:4:23|In the rundown shack, [Han Shaofen] worked diligently while taking care of the child. She wrapped the child in a thick floral blanket, tied it to her back with a rope, wrung out the washed diapers with her hands, shook off the excess water, and then hung them in the yard in an orderly manner.
0:4:23|0:4:27|The child, always silently accompanying her on her back.
0:4:53|0:5:2|Even in the deserted late night, [Han Shaofen] tirelessly carries her child on her back, dragging a cart, searching through the garbage cans for usable items.
0:5:8|0:5:22|Outside, she used her own hands to slowly move as much scrap as possible, hoping to get a good price. At home, [Han Shaofen] tirelessly took on all the responsibilities of raising the children. Even though her legs were not convenient, she still worked hard on her own.
0:5:22|0:5:38|He lifted the child's blanket, cradled the child in his arms, the child's little face twitching, looking very displeased. He used his other hand to pat the child's head, trying to calm the child down. After a moment, he picked up the knitted cap on the bed and put it on the child's head.
0:5:38|0:5:55|The child gradually stopped crying, holding the child a little higher, picking up the bottle on the right side of the table, testing the temperature, and slowly feeding the child. Days passed like this, day by day, [Han Shaofen] not only had to take care of the young child, but also had to bear the weight of two people with the age of several times.
0:5:55|0:6:4|During the day, [Han Shaofen] needs to meet the West Lake Man who collects garbage regularly. He drags heavy and large pieces of old cardboard step by step into the garbage dump.
0:6:4|0:6:22|He stared closely at the balanced scale, the humble man negotiating the price. [Han Shaofen] dragged her entangled legs, wandering through every corner of the recycling station. The man seemed to understand her difficulties and patiently talked with her until she sold all the thick cardboard on her cart and pulled her wooden cart back.
0:6:22|0:6:31|In the midst of [Han Shaofen]'s struggle, days passed by one by one. One day, a young and beautiful woman came to her house and played with the child in her arms.
0:6:48|0:7:2|The child with a knitted hat was held in the arms of the disfigured aunt, looking at the grandmother with small eyes. The grandmother, seeing the child's bright smile, also smiled. She nodded slightly and showed a satisfied smile to the disfigured aunt.
0:7:23|0:7:26|The grandmother walked shakily into the office.
0:7:48|0:7:58|Grandma lowered her head for a moment, avoiding the gaze of the person in front of her. She lowered her head again, looking at the ground, and let out a long sigh.
0:8:35|0:8:46|The grandmother helplessly lowered her head and walked out with a cane, looking back frequently as she walked, as if wanting to say something, but remained silent.
0:8:46|0:9:4|Grandma once again leaned on her cane and entered an office that looked like it belonged to a person in charge. She refused to sit down and earnestly hoped that the person in front of her could help her. The two stood by the window, too far apart to hear their voices, only able to see the sunlight shining on their faces, revealing the anxiety on Grandma's face.
0:9:5|0:9:15|It seems that even the person across from her was moved, and the two of them seemed to have reached some kind of consensus. [Grandma] stayed in the palace for a while before leaving the police station, and then she continued to explain to the government officials.
0:12:9|0:12:12|[Ma Dongmei] understands his feelings for the children more.
0:12:16|0:12:20|However, [Han Shaofen] is indeed facing difficulties.
0:12:41|0:12:48|The responsible woman took the water from the director's hand with a heavy heart, feeling uneasy, she put down the cup and spoke again.
0:13:42|0:14:0|Listen, the woman hesitated and nodded. That day, Grandma [Han Xue] and the little girl got up early. The girl carried a brand new backpack, bouncing around the house, occasionally showing a smile to Grandma, very happy. But Grandma just stood alone by the window, staring tightly at the door outside.
0:14:0|0:14:9|The sunlight outlined the contours on [Grandma]'s face, as well as the unease and anxiety. The little girl was still bouncing around in the room, exuding a sense of joy.
0:14:10|0:14:17|But he found that Grandma had been standing by the window, refusing to move, so he ran up and grabbed Grandma's arm.
0:15:10|0:15:28|Aunt Liu could hardly meet Grandma's eyes at this moment. She held Grandma's arm and walked to the side in three steps and two steps. After helping Grandma sit down, Aunt Liu's lips trembled slightly. Despite Grandma's expectant gaze, she still didn't speak, then looked to the side.
0:16:51|0:16:55|The child is feeling very sad.
0:17:4|0:17:11|Facing the crucial question from the little girl, [Uncle] remained silent. He reached out his hand and gently touched the girl's head.
0:18:52|0:18:58|The problem now is, school has already started, how can we not delay [Han Xue] from going to school?
0:21:4|0:21:6|[Han Xue] and her grandmother held each other tightly, unable to help but be moved.
0:21:28|0:21:44|Seeing the deep bond between the grandmother and the girl, even the two staff members couldn't help but be moved. So, the staff member Aunt Liu returned to the leader's office and submitted a proposal to discuss the matter. The leader was seen carefully reading the document in front of him, picking up a pen to make annotations on it.
0:21:52|0:22:14|Aunt Liu walked out of the office, carrying the documents, and then walked into the police station. The officer looked at the information Aunt Liu handed over, operated on the computer, and handed her a small book with the residents' household registration. Holding the thin little book in her hand, Aunt Liu couldn't help but tighten her grip, a relieved smile appearing on her face.
0:22:14|0:22:20|She returned to her grandmother's house, sat face to face with her grandmother, and handed the resident household register in her hand to her grandmother.
0:22:42|0:22:58|Upon hearing these words, [Grandma Han] felt a huge weight lifted off her heart. A look of confusion briefly flashed across her face, then she lowered her head slightly and revealed a relieved smile. The red leaves fluttered southward again, autumn returned, and another year passed in the blink of an eye.
0:22:58|0:23:18|On this day, [Han Grandma] came to the supermarket, carefully choosing something, her eyes hesitantly wavering. She seemed to feel troubled by the prices, and then the scene shifted to a primary school, where [Han Grandma] and a large group of parents stood at the entrance waiting for the children to finish school.
0:23:18|0:23:27|The security guard slowly pushed open the gate. Amid the bustling crowd of parents, in the eager and hopeful gazes of everyone, the children ran out with the vigor of youth.
0:24:14|0:24:28|[Han Xue] smiled and supported her grandmother's arm with her hand, while her grandmother held a cane and walked alongside [Han Xue] towards home. Back at home, her grandmother prepared a sumptuous dinner for [Han Xue], and then took something out from the room.
0:24:34|0:24:56|Grandma opened the cloth bag and took out neatly stacked scarves from inside. [Han Xue], who was eating ribs, was about to reach out but was stopped by Grandma. Saying that, Grandma took [Han Xue]'s hand, wiped off the oil on her own sleeve, and draped the scarf on [Han Xue]. Just then, the sound of the door opening could be heard.
0:25:25|0:25:32|Grandma took the clothes handed to her by Aunt Liu, her lips trembling slightly, as if unsure how to express her gratitude.
0:25:38|0:25:44|Grandma patted Aunt Liu's hand affectionately and nodded. On that day, [Han Xue] was attending a music class at school.
0:26:27|0:26:43|At night at home, [Han Xue] sings and dances in the room, while [Grandma Han] smiles and claps along beside her. In the dimly lit room, only a desk lamp emits a warm glow, like a spotlight perfectly illuminating [Han Xue]'s dancing movements.
0:26:44|0:26:59|[Han Grandma] sits on the bed, cane placed aside, rhythmically clapping along to the beat for [Han Xue]. Facing [Han Grandma], [Han Xue] tries to show the full extent of the song to [Han Grandma]. As the performance ends, [Han Grandma] applauds, seeing [Han Xue]'s brilliant performance, unable to stop smiling.
0:26:59|0:27:10|Unexpectedly, at this moment, [Han Xue] suddenly stood still in the room. In the puzzled eyes of [Grandma Han], [Han Xue] was looking straight ahead, her gaze unfocused, tears welling up in her eyes.
0:27:13|0:27:19|Hearing the inquiry from [Grandma Han], [Han Xue]'s emotions became even more painful, a tear slid from the corner of her eye, and [Grandma Han] quickly got up.
0:28:17|0:28:40|Saying that, [Grandma Han] pulled [Han Xue] into her arms and hugged her tightly. The next morning, after [Han Xue] went to school, [Grandma Han] started searching for things in the house. She took out a huge bamboo box and rummaged through it under the clothes.
0:28:40|0:28:57|Grandma dug out a dirty cloth bundle from under the box, she placed the bundle heavily on the bed, then sat down, turned sideways to untie the knot on top, while sorting through layers of old clothes stained with traces of time, she was looking for something, feeling around for a long time, and then took out a small silk satin bundle from the interlayer.
0:28:57|0:29:8|She carefully picked up the shiny little bag, and after unfolding layer by layer, inside it turned out to be a pair of quite nice jade bracelets. The jade bracelets in her old hands reflected a warm light.
0:29:9|0:29:29|Reflected in the hesitant and silent eyes of [Han Xue], ultimately, no words slipped out from Grandma's mouth. The jade bracelet could transcend the intense drama seen by anyone, but many years had passed, her face no longer bore the resemblance of a young girl. She recalled that distant afternoon when she sat in the dilapidated room, her mother carefully holding this satin pouch.
0:29:45|0:30:3|During the conversation, the old man carefully put the bracelet on [Han Shaofen]'s hand. [Han Shaofen] held the bracelet and her mother's hand together, behind them stood an elderly person with earnest expectations.
0:30:3|0:30:13|And now, looking at the significant pair of bracelets in her hand, [Han Grandma] had a moment of confusion, but after some thought, she still took the bracelets and left the house.
0:30:14|0:30:28|Pedestrians come and go, while traffic flows steadily. [Han Granny] stands alone with a cane, arriving at the entrance of the pawnshop. The passersby hurry past, no one has time to stop. Beneath the four characters of Shunhe Pawnshop, she appears so small and helpless.
0:30:28|0:30:46|The scene reveals an aged appearance, with the glass covered in densely packed service principles, resembling a deep abyss that devours those troubled by stomach issues. [Han Xue] stands at the doorway, leaning the cane to the side, slowly takes out a silk cloth pouch from her pocket, and carefully extracts the bracelet from inside.
0:30:46|0:30:57|Her hands were still wearing gloves, indicating the importance of the bracelet. Just as she was about to walk into the pawnshop, [Han Xue] hesitated again, the clear expression of hesitation and reluctance on her face.
0:30:57|0:31:18|At this moment, he had arrived here with no other choice. He left behind only a dusty figure, his waist appearing so hunched. Taking each step cautiously, he used a cane to support himself on the side with every step up the stairs, then moved his leg up. And so, he walked into the pawnshop.
0:31:18|0:31:20|The next day, [Han Xue] returned home.
0:31:56|0:32:4|[Han Xue] continues to return to the center of the house, dancing gracefully to the music playing on the recorder, every step exuding joy.
0:32:37|0:32:52|Grandma looked at [Han Xue] with a loving gaze, her eyes full of care and affection. Her lips curved slightly upwards, because of Han Xue's performance, making her feel that everything was worth it. After finishing the dance, little [Han Xue] walked slowly to the tape recorder, bent down, and rested her head on it.
0:33:21|0:33:38|In the classroom that day, during a composition class, the female teacher picked up the chalk on the podium and started writing on the blackboard, to the eager anticipation of the students. The sound of the chalk hitting the blackboard was clear, and as the teacher wrote, chalk dust fell onto the blackboard.
0:33:38|0:33:45|Several seconds passed, as the children whispered to each other, the teacher finished writing six big characters. She turned around, looked at the children below the stage, and said.
0:34:3|0:34:8|The teacher threw the chalk back into the chalk box, stepped down from the platform, and urged the children to write their essays one by one.
0:34:10|0:34:27|The teacher walked around the classroom to supervise everyone, checking if each person was writing properly. The children were all bowing their heads, racking their brains to write their compositions. Some children were deeply focused, not lifting their heads for half an hour. Some children were chatting around, while others wrote for a while and played for a while.
0:34:27|0:34:39|While [Han Xue] was at a loss, she stared at her homework with a bewildered look on her face. Just as [Han Xue] was feeling helpless, the little boy next to her put down his pen and raised his hand confidently.
0:34:46|0:34:55|At this moment, [Han Xue] was still holding a pen and working on the questions. There were only questions on the notebook in front of her, without any other traces. The teacher noticed this anomaly.
0:35:29|0:35:40|[Han Xue] listened to the teacher's words, sat down slowly, clenched the pen in her hand, and a hint of melancholy in her eyes. After class, [Han Xue] walked with the little boy she had just fought with earlier.
0:36:23|0:36:39|The little boy ran off happily. He lifted his leg and sat on the back seat of his mother's bicycle, then turned around to wave goodbye to the girl. In [Han Xue]'s gaze, the boy and his mother gradually disappeared into the distance.
0:36:52|0:37:3|[Han Xue] gazed affectionately at the boy and his mother chatting and laughing, a hint of longing in her eyes. As she continued to watch, she seemed to be lost in a daydream, as if she herself were sitting in the back seat with her own mother.
0:37:34|0:37:47|In [Han Xue]'s imagination, her mother should be a woman with a delicate face and friendly demeanor. Not only does she pick her up from school every day, but she also takes her out to play. Her mother would hold her in her arms, and put on a hat woven with flowers for her.
0:37:51|0:37:58|The image of the mother is so vivid. Thinking of this, [Han Xue] in real life couldn't help but smile.
0:38:11|0:38:13|The woman suddenly pressed the brake.
0:38:48|0:39:12|The woman suddenly recalled the distant scene of snow sweeping. She stood with several coworkers, watching a woman with a limp, pushing a cart with one hand and holding a child in the other. Under the gaze of everyone, the woman with a limp held the child tightly in her arms.
0:39:15|0:39:22|The woman riding a bicycle finished reminiscing about [Han Xue]'s past with the child, patted the child's shoulder, and rode on towards home.
0:40:5|0:40:12|After listening to the words of [Han Shaofen]'s grandmother, Liu Ayun bit her lower lip and nodded. In the schoolyard, children were playing in small groups, causing a commotion.
0:41:10|0:41:26|The boy moved his lips and told [Xiao Xue] everything he heard from his mother yesterday. [Xiao Xue] stood still on the spot. At this moment, [Han Grandma], who had just finished a busy day, stood in the dilapidated courtyard, looking up at the sky. The sky was very dark, like an unbroken swamp.
0:41:26|0:41:45|With an impending sense of a storm approaching, she stood quietly at the doorway with a baton in her right hand, her eyes filled with indescribable emotions. Her gaze was unfocused, as if pondering something. Dressed as if ready to go out, she didn't know if the next moment would be when she had to leave this place.
0:41:45|0:41:55|At the same time, in the school, [Xiao Xue] is sitting alone in a spacious classroom, with no one around. The room is empty, with only her figure.
0:41:56|0:42:7|The voices of the children in the distance came sporadically, separated by the transparent window, appearing sparse and sparse, as if it was not the sound that was divided by the window, but two different worlds.
0:42:7|0:42:18|[Xiao Xue] sat in her own seat, leaning slightly forward as if slumped on the table, with her hair hanging down from the side of her face, a few strands partially covering her face, creating a scattered play of light and shadow.
0:42:19|0:42:36|Her tender right hand held a colored pen, doodling on a piece of white paper on the table. She had already drawn a figure of herself with greenish handwriting, standing alone on the side. At this moment, as if feeling something in her heart, she shook her wrist and began to draw next to the little figure.
0:42:36|0:42:45|In her pen, a long-haired figure gradually emerges, slightly taller than her. Obviously, the long-haired figure represents her mother.
0:43:7|0:43:24|As evening fell, the sky darkened, like a night that would never see light, pressing down in large swathes. [Han Xue], as usual, leaned on a cane and made her way down the street with each step. On the other side, [Han Shaofen] had already left the school gate alone with her backpack, while [Han Xue] was still on the road.
0:43:58|0:44:15|After bidding farewell to Aunt Liu, [Han Xue] looked at the letter in her hand, then carefully put it in her bag and continued walking forward. She walked slowly to the school gate, which was usually bustling with people but now closed and empty, with no one in sight.
0:44:15|0:44:21|This made [Han Xue] curiously approach the door, and after a moment, she knocked on the door with force, wanting to see if anyone was inside.
0:44:37|0:44:52|After listening to the security guard's words, [Han Xue]'s psychological doubts deepened, like dark vines entwining her heart. Her expression froze, the wrinkles on her face deepening slightly. After a while, she came back to her senses, belatedly thanked the security guard, and turned to walk away.
0:44:53|0:45:9|Even her umbrella was left behind in the original place. As the night fell, along with the darkness, snowflakes began to fall one after another, like a heavy snow that had conquered half of the winter. The snowflakes no longer looked light and dancing, but more like a huge net, densely falling down.
0:45:9|0:45:20|Xiaoxue buried herself deeply in her cotton jacket, hunching her neck as she walked in the heavy snow. Her figure was covered by dense snowflakes, making it impossible to even see her trace in the snow.
0:45:21|0:45:30|At the same time, the anxious [Grandma Han] was walking on the street with an uneasy look, looking around for Little Xue's whereabouts, even her cane slipped on the road.
0:45:30|0:45:41|In the howling cold wind, she tried her best to loudly ask every passerby about the whereabouts of Xiao Xue, even though her voice was muffled in the wind and snow, and every bit of hope scattered like a faint light.
0:45:42|0:46:0|She just tightened her scarf, shook off the snow on her shoulders, and continued to walk steadfastly. The tapping sound of the cane echoed rhythmically on the long street. The crisp and rhythmic sound played the anxious voice of a woman. Pedestrians hurried by, cars flew past on the road.
0:46:0|0:46:10|In the vast city, the figure of [Han Xue]'s grandmother is so small, as if no one cares about this corner. Meanwhile, [Han Shaofen] has already struggled to reach a big tree.
0:46:28|0:46:39|Aunt Liu was also searching in the woods by the road with a flashlight at this time, and finally found the crying [Han Shaofen] under a tree. So, Aunt Liu took [Han Shaofen] home to warm up.
0:46:54|0:47:9|At the same time, Grandma also slowly walked into the forest step by step. Among the towering trees, she looked around, searching for the traces of [Han Shaofen]. She waited patiently in the cold wind and snow, searching for every trace of [Han Shaofen] in the woods.
0:47:43|0:47:59|At this moment, the grandmother was still wandering outside, feeling melancholic. Her face was in the shadows, dim and unclear. "Come, Xue," [Han Shaofen], who was curled up in the blanket, got up and took the clothes handed to her by her aunt, slowly draping them over herself.
0:48:2|0:48:8|Her life became even more difficult.
0:49:35|0:49:50|[Han Shaofen] sitting on the sofa slowly got up, put the blanket aside, and started putting on her shoes. [Aunt Liu] next to her quickly stood up and supported Xiaoxue. [Aunt Liu] held Xiaoxue's hand and walked step by step in the dark forest, with car lights flashing behind them.
0:49:50|0:49:53|Xiaoxue walked faster and faster, anxious to see her grandmother.
0:50:29|0:50:47|Grandma looked at Xiaoxue expectantly, stuffed the letter into Xiaoxue's arms, and then reached out her gloved right hand to look at the letter together with Xiaoxue. Meanwhile, Aunt Liu watched from afar, as if she dared not approach or disturb, shifting her gaze elsewhere, seemingly holding back tears from falling.
0:50:47|0:50:54|Early the next morning, [Xiao Xue] got up as usual and prepared breakfast alone in the kitchen, carrying a huge steamer pot.
0:50:55|0:51:12|He picked up the porcelain plate next to him, took out the freshly steamed bun and placed it on top. The bun was steaming hot, and he held the plate full of buns in one hand and a plate of freshly steamed meat in the other, swaying towards the table by the window. The morning sunlight outlined the figure of [Xiao Xue] who was sensible again.
0:51:13|0:51:34|Outlining the clear contours of the dishes, also scattered on the table, the [grandson] carefully rearranged the table, placing the main course and side dishes on it. Then he turned around, smiling, and went to the kitchen to fetch water. Turning back, he walked towards the [grandmother] who was still lying motionless in bed.
0:51:54|0:52:2|Xiaoxue hurriedly turned around and ran towards the windowsill, picked up the nearby kettle, poured hot water into a porcelain bowl, and carried the bowl towards her grandmother.
0:52:4|0:52:19|He held the bowl up to his grandmother's mouth, thinking that this way she could drink hot water. However, after trying for a while, he realized that his grandmother, who was unconscious, couldn't drink any water. So, [Han Xue] thought for a moment and then placed the bowl on the bedside before quickly running to the kitchen.
0:52:19|0:52:28|She hesitated in the kitchen for a moment, then took out a small spoon and quickly ran back to the room with it. She tiptoed to her grandmother's bedside.
0:52:29|0:52:45|Bend down, holding a bowl in one hand and a spoon in the other, slowly bringing the water to Grandma's lips.
0:52:47|0:52:52|[Han Xue] was suddenly panicked, placed the bowl on the table, and then turned to open the door and ran out.
0:52:53|0:53:4|The heavy snow outside continued to fall, accumulating a thick layer on the ground. [Han Xue] braved the cold wind, running in the snow, not caring even if she fell.
0:53:15|0:53:17|But she continued to run aimlessly.
0:53:25|0:53:32|[Han Xue] is running desperately on the slippery stone road, tears on her face seem to be freezing, but she doesn't care.
0:53:54|0:54:11|Aunt Liu quickly put on her clothes and went out with [Han Xue] after hearing the news. The two returned to [Han Xue]'s home, in a rush, they took out the small cart that grandma used daily. They had grandma lie on her back in the cart, then one of them grabbed the handle of the cart and hurriedly headed towards the hospital for several seconds.
0:54:11|0:54:28|In the bumpy ride, Grandma remained unconscious, with a slight frown on her forehead, showing no signs of waking up. Upon arrival at the hospital, Grandma was quickly taken into the operating room and lay weakly on the hospital bed. Aunt Liu and [Han Xue] walked to the door, anxiously pacing back and forth. In the midst of unease, the doctor came out.
0:55:39|0:55:45|[Han Xue] nodded, glanced at the notice, and suddenly ran up to the front of the window at the entrance of Jiangfei City.
0:56:47|0:56:50|Without stopping, the people accompanying the dean walked away in [Han Xue]'s gaze towards the distance.
0:57:14|0:57:19|During that week, [Han Xue] as Jiang Lü'er actually knelt down and crawled step by step towards Dean An.
0:58:49|0:59:3|The dean stood up straight, feeling his pockets while pushing the little girl towards the crowd. People around wiped tears from their eyes. At that moment, the auntie from the consumption room also stood among the crowd, waiting for the dean's decision.
0:59:26|0:59:34|In just a few seconds, [Han Shaofen] Auntie collected a large sum of money in her hands. Now, Grandma can finally have surgery as soon as possible.
0:59:43|0:59:56|After experiencing her grandmother's serious illness, [Han Xue] sat alone in the classroom, staring blankly at her previous words. The mother she had drawn with her own hands now appeared so glaring and painful in her eyes.
0:59:56|1:0:14|[Han Xue] slowly reached out her hand, tearing the drawing that had once been filled with her countless love and effort from the notebook and holding it in her hand. The torn edges of the paper were uneven, as if indicating the bumpy road of [Han Xue]. She carefully examined the drawing in the sunlight, tears already sliding down her cheeks.
1:0:14|1:0:29|[Han Xue] suddenly stood up, the paper in his hand feeling so hot and annoying at this moment. His face first showed sadness, then gradually evolved into a complex mix of anger. He reached out and forcefully tore the paper in half, but that wasn't enough.
1:0:29|1:0:45|His movements became faster and faster, as if venting his anger, tearing the painting in his hand into pieces. Finally, the thin piece of paper in his hand was torn into fragments. He walked to the window, pushed it open, and threw the fragments outside. They fluttered down like snowflakes.
1:0:45|1:0:50|Later, [Han Xue] walked onto the playground and encountered the boy who had previously mocked her among the playing children.
1:1:6|1:1:19|[Han Xue] looked at the two boys in front of her bowing their heads in apology, couldn't help but show a faint smile, and then nodded. Finally, on the day when it was time to discharge grandma, [Han Xue] and the two boys went to the hospital entrance together to pick up grandma.
1:1:19|1:1:27|Grandma, who has just recovered from a serious illness, is still unsteady on her feet. Three children each hold one side of Grandma and slowly help her walk towards the small swing car.
1:1:31|1:1:41|With the combined efforts of the three children, they managed to get Grandma onto the cart. They pulled the cart together while cheering each other on, heading towards home with [Han Xue].
1:1:44|1:2:1|In a joyful atmosphere, the children walked away with [Han Xue], and their lives finally returned to normal. From then on, every day on the way to school, [Han Xue] carried her own school bag and followed her grandmother pulling a cart. [Han Xue] also held onto one side of the handle, hoping to relieve her grandmother's pressure.
1:2:1|1:2:6|Sometimes when she comes across abandoned plastic bottles on the road, [Han Xue] picks them up first and puts them behind the cart.
1:2:8|1:2:23|In this way, [Han Xue] always accompanies her grandmother, sharing the burdens and hardships of her grandmother's life. She always smiles, running around her grandmother. With [Han Xue]'s help, her grandmother's toil is greatly reduced, and the inconvenience of her legs and the weakness of her body seem less important.
1:2:24|1:2:41|Therefore, no matter how tough and difficult the days are, there is hope. [Han Xue] would accompany her grandmother to the vacant lot piled with scrap, bid farewell to her grandmother, and reluctantly carry her school bag to school. In the evening, the grandmother, who had toiled all day, would push open the gate and pull the old cart back to the small courtyard.
1:2:41|1:2:52|The cart was heavy, with stacks of hard cardboard scattered loosely inside the frame, tied with thin plastic ropes. There were also many bottles and cans piled in the gaps, making it look very crowded.
1:2:52|1:3:10|[Han Xue] struggled to pull the car into the yard, took a deep breath, and parked the car in the middle of the yard. Then she turned around, switched from pulling to pushing the car, and slowly pushed it to the shed in the corner of the yard. For Grandma, who had just recovered from a serious illness, the tasks that used to be manageable now became difficult.
1:3:11|1:3:22|[Ma Dongmei] originally had difficulty walking, and at her old age, she was unwilling to reduce her workload at this moment because she still needed to support her family. After she placed the cart down, her legs were already feeling a bit weak.
1:3:22|1:3:39|Continuing on, as she was adjusting herself, the cane in her hand accidentally got tangled in the rope of the cart, causing the cane to get stuck under her foot, making her lose her balance. Luckily at that moment, [Han Shaofen] was coming home from school and saw her grandmother falling, so she hurried over.
1:3:47|1:3:50|Grandma looked into [Han Shaofen]'s eyes and nodded.
1:4:9|1:4:15|Grandma's eyes lit up with a hint of surprise, and she smiled slightly. After school, [Han Xue] walked on the street with her classmates.
1:4:42|1:4:53|The scene shifts to a bustling street, where a group of children are gathered, each holding a small bunch of roses. They greet passersby, but few stop to engage with them.
1:5:3|1:5:18|At this moment, [Han Xue] caught up with a simple and honest man, who seemed to be saying something about selling. The man seemed to want to push the girl away strangely, but [Han Xue] kept chasing after him, handing the flowers to the man. The man seemed to be finally persuaded and took one.
1:5:24|1:5:47|Facing the cheers and applause from the audience, the students did not react much. With this in mind, the children once again gathered their courage, tidied up the flowers in their hands, wandered on the street, and tried to sell them to every passerby. They stopped a grandma who was on her way to buy vegetables, and chased after a young couple carrying a bag next to her.
1:5:47|1:5:52|They just hope to sell a little more, but business is always disappointing.
1:6:22|1:6:37|The boy ran home to get his accordion, then went to the bustling street with [Han Xue], playing the accordion, singing, and selling flowers to passersby. This scene was also seen by two people on a nearby overpass.
1:6:52|1:7:8|Saying that, the man and woman on the rooftop smiled at each other, put away their devices, walked down the steps, and headed towards [Han Xue]. That night, as usual, [Han Shaofen] tidied up the room, holding a wrinkled cloth in her hand, cleaning up the things on the table in the dim light.
1:7:8|1:7:14|She brought the books on the table over, then wiped every corner with a cloth, tidying up until she reached [Han Xue]'s pencil case.
1:7:15|1:7:31|He casually opened the pencil case, only to find a large denomination bill hidden underneath, pressed by a pencil. Holding the crumpled bill, he looked at it under the dim desk lamp for a long time, a hint of fear and anger flashing across his face. After a moment, it turned into an unmistakable look of confusion.
1:7:31|1:7:34|So he came to the bedside of [Han Xue].
1:9:9|1:9:24|[Han Shaofen] reached out and tightly embraced [Han Xue], carefully tucking her in with the blanket. The next day after school, the child carried her small backpack and walked to a railing by the roadside. [Han Xue] sat down slowly, furrowing her brows slightly, with a look of confusion on her face.
1:10:12|1:10:16|The air seemed to solidify, and upon hearing these words, [Han Xue] stood up abruptly.
1:10:59|1:11:8|Han Xue thought for a moment, then nodded slightly. The next day, on the pedestrian bridge in the city center, [Han Xue] knelt on a cushion with grass inserted on her head, while her classmates stood behind her.
1:11:15|1:11:17|The little girl next to [Han Xue] seems to have a crush on her.
1:12:58|1:13:4|At Aunt Liu's house, Aunt Liu, who was busy with housework, suddenly heard a voice coming from the TV, "Hello, Madam."
1:13:44|1:13:56|As soon as the woman finished speaking, the grandmother froze on the spot, even the glass bottle in her hand slipped to the ground unnoticed. It was only when she saw the familiar face after the woman took off her glasses that the grandmother came to her senses.
1:14:0|1:14:10|[Han Grandma]'s expression on her face, from the previous confusion, gradually changed to a kind of belated surprise. She showed a sincere smile to [Han Xue]'s mother and quickly led her into the house.
1:14:10|1:14:28|[Han Xue]'s mother followed her grandmother's slow steps and entered this old dilapidated house, where [Han Xue] had lived for nearly ten years since birth. The room exuded a sense of antiquity and hardship, with the walls showing signs of decay and neglect.
1:14:29|1:14:48|There are only two thousand rooms in total, and the only valuable thing may be the six pounds of gold quietly lying on the table. [Han Xue]'s mother looked around the room in confusion, feeling lost in such a harsh environment, her gaze wandering aimlessly around the room. The grandmother limped.
1:14:52|1:15:8|[Han Xue]'s mother bent down, somewhat nervously, to take the water bowl handed to her by her grandmother. After placing it on the table in front of her, she sat down facing her grandmother. The woman lowered her head to avoid her grandmother's gaze.
1:15:15|1:15:25|At this moment, Aunt Liu, who has been taking care of [Han Xue]'s family, pushed the door open and entered. The look in her eyes towards [Han Xue]'s mother was almost green, and Grandma quickly pulled her aside.
1:15:40|1:15:51|Aunt Liu held Grandma's arm, lowered her head in thought for a moment. Aunt Liu pursed her lips, bypassed Grandma, and walked steadily towards [Han Xue]'s mother.
1:16:39|1:16:44|After hearing this, the two people present were both stunned. After a moment, [Mrs. Liu] looked at him and spoke.
1:16:56|1:16:59|[Han Xue]’s mother holds her grandmother’s hand, feeling extremely distressed.
1:18:0|1:18:24|[Han Xue]'s mother almost shed tears on her face as she spoke, her lowered face filled with guilt. At this moment, the door of the room was pushed open again.
1:18:28|1:18:37|After hearing the journalist's accusations, [Han Xue]'s mother couldn't bear it anymore. Without saying a word, she pushed open the door of the room, and Liang Liang ran out from inside.
1:19:14|1:19:18|Late at night, [Han Xue] murmurs to herself in her dream.
1:19:52|1:20:5|Grandma held [Han Xue] tightly, embracing her with aching heart, holding her face in her hands and wiping away the tears on her face. The next day, [Han Xue]'s mother sat in the office, holding a pen in her hand, writing something in a notebook.
1:20:45|1:20:50|The male journalist spoke earnestly. The woman beside him gestured for him to calm down.
1:21:18|1:21:25|Little [Han Xue]'s mother furrowed her brows and walked away. On the other side, Little [Han Xue], Aunt Liu, and Grandma were walking on the road.
1:21:30|1:21:35|The aunt smiled and patted the head of little [Han Xue]. At the same time, the mother of little [Han Xue] had just left her workplace.
1:22:0|1:22:7|During the time when the secretary helped her read quotes to the media, [Han Xue]'s mother wandered aimlessly on the street.
1:22:14|1:22:18|Before long, my boyfriend met the daughter of a high-ranking official.
1:22:31|1:22:35|At this point, I had assumed a new identity for several months.
1:22:42|1:22:51|Saying that, little [Han Xue] was holding her grandmother and aunt's hands, spreading her feet and running forward. And little [Han Xue]'s mother passed through the crowd, her steps getting faster and faster.
1:23:41|1:23:58|The two left the entrance of the city hall. At this moment, [Han Xue]'s mother walked through the crowd and arrived at a lush forest. She briskly stepped over the scattered dry branches and fallen leaves on the ground, her shadow casting a lonely and slender shape behind her, her vacant gaze moving forward.
1:23:58|1:24:5|Silently all the way, she walked to the edge of the cliff, standing on the lonely strait looking out at the sea, leaving only a slender figure.
1:24:43|1:24:59|[Han Xue]'s mother lowered her eyes and walked step by step in the yellow grass. Against the light, the light and shadow on her face were unpredictable, as if contemplating the past and the future. Finally, she stood in front of that familiar trash can, where the past and reality overlapped before her eyes.
1:24:59|1:25:11|The old, rundown trash can stood quietly as usual, with a few more cracks from the rain. Suddenly, he turned and was surprised to see [Han Xue] running towards him alone.
1:25:11|1:25:22|His body stiffened for a moment, the threads of fate converging before his eyes, collapsing and reappearing, discarded memories, past life, [Han Xue]'s fantasies, mother's guilt.
1:25:25|1:25:39|The earth-shattering call of recognition seemed to bring the mother in the clouds back to earth. She staggered towards [Han Xue], her legs almost not obeying her, then reached out and embraced this familiar yet unfamiliar child.
1:25:39|1:25:59|In the faint light of dawn, in the approaching warmth of spring, in the exposure of Han Nai Nai and Liu Auntie's comfort and touch intertwined, this mother and daughter finally embraced each other. [Han Shaofen] embraced [Han Xue] by the waist, lifting her onto her shoulders. [Han Xue] buried her head in her mother's neck, her shoulders gently trembling.
1:25:59|1:26:5|Releasing pent-up emotions, and only at this moment, the soul of [Han Shaofen] barely returned to her body.
1:26:6|1:26:16|His bewildered expression vanished in an instant, his eyes unknowingly moistened at the corners, and his entire face wrinkled with excitement, as if releasing the suppressed emotions of the past decade.
1:26:16|1:26:26|Aunt Liu and Grandma Han stood not far away, quietly watching this touching scene. They exchanged a glance in silence, seeing comfort, peace, and love in each other's eyes.
1:26:27|1:26:45|At this moment, [Han Shaofen] closed her eyes, feeling the warmth of the person in her arms and the passion in their heart. Meanwhile, [Han Xue] gazed tightly at her mother's side, not knowing how long she had been holding her. After putting down [Han Xue], her mother took her hand and walked slowly and firmly towards the aunt and grandmother.
1:27:3|1:27:10|In Han Nai Nai's shocked dream, [Han Shaofen] actually knelt down and looked up into Nai Nai's eyes.
