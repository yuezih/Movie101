0:2:20|0:2:38|The scene shifts to the Kaifeng prison at night, where the constables are gathered together gambling. In the midst of the crowd, a muscular young man struggles to lift a huge stone beneath him. On the side, a shadowy old constable smoking a cigarette looks towards the young man.
0:2:40|0:3:5|This is the young man who just joined our catching department - [Dao Yichang]. In a moment, in the public office, [Dao Yichang] broke several huge stone locks and even lifted the stones above his head. Seeing this, the constable [Zhuge Qingyun] knocked on the table with a smoking pipe and said to the painter behind him.
0:3:37|0:4:0|Upon entering the tiger's den, [Dao Yichang] was able to establish a connection with the gambling boss and conspire to cheat money. It seems that his skills are not to be underestimated. As the camera rises, the night in Kaifeng city is illuminated by dim lights. Above this faint light, the four words of "Qimen Dunjia" fall into the screen, followed by a blood-red color from the sky, immense and heading towards the heart of Kaifeng.
0:4:0|0:4:18|This object is extraordinary, surrounded by broken stones, with a crane-like body, not resembling gold or stone, but rather with a somewhat fleshy feel. Surrounded by heavenly fire, it smashed into the tomb, causing the mountain to be illuminated by fire. Where it collided, the surrounding area was flattened, and a shimmering light was seen on its body.
0:4:19|0:4:26|Reflected in the dying mountain fire, the situation is particularly tense. The scene shifts to [Dao Yichang] in the bustling market, chatting with the shop owner in front of a pancake stall.
0:5:2|0:5:17|[Dao Yichang] looked at the tofu seller and said. Just as he was bored, [Dao Yichang] happened to glance over and his gaze was caught by someone.
0:5:20|0:5:42|Behind him, a burly man with a single eye was carrying a huge fish tank and walking through the crowd to the fishing ground. He half-rewarded and half-issued a wanted order placed in front of his eyes for comparison. The painter Hu Zhou's portrait was casually compared to this person, who was seven points similar. At the most concentrated table, he immediately followed the burly man.
0:5:42|0:6:2|After he walked away, the half-mouthed aunt who had just been arrogant took out a compass from under her clothes. She looked closely and saw that the pointer on the compass was pointing in the direction the big man had gone. Seeing this, the aunt immediately chased after him in the direction indicated by the compass. The scene shifted to the big man arriving at an inn, slamming the fish tank on the table and shouting.
0:7:2|0:7:28|As the eyes followed, the small fish in the fish tank suddenly grew larger, turning into a monstrous fish with three eyes and sharp teeth, swallowing the big man in one gulp. At that moment, [Dao Yichang] leaped down from the roof, wielding his sword towards the monster fish, but the creature agilely dodged the attack with a flick of its tail.
0:7:31|0:7:42|And so, the auntie finally made her move, closing her teeth tightly to form a hard knot, trapping the strange fish in front of the screen, and then pulling out a red cushion from her sleeve to seal off the surrounding wooden tables and households.
0:7:59|0:8:16|As soon as the words fell, the cage loosened, and the strange fish wriggled its body, breaking free from the restraints. It dropped its head towards [Big Bimao]. Without panic, [Big Bimao] raised her hand and pried open the mouth of the strange fish, reaching in and pulling out its tongue, which was over half a meter long.
0:8:16|0:8:28|When the strange fish was distracted by pain, it was kicked by Auntie to the second floor of the inn. It then broke through the roof and fled outside, chasing the monster into the bustling market in a hurry.
0:8:31|0:8:53|In the inn, seeing the shopkeeper and the shop assistant startled, the old lady reached into her bosom and took out five pieces of firework paper talismans. The items in her hand turned into moths and flew towards the faces of the people nearby. As they approached, the moths disappeared and turned into sparkling powder, merging into the eyes of the shopkeeper and others. Then the great deity took out a piece of flower cloth and displayed it in the screen.
0:8:53|0:9:11|Incorporating oneself into the fabric, moving with the wind, chasing after the strange fish, looking at the shopkeeper and others, the golden moth pounced, already forgetting everything, unaware of the previous danger, causing a commotion. It was difficult to find the whereabouts of the strange fish, so he emerged from the flower fabric, disguised as a Taoist, and used a compass to explore.
0:9:11|0:9:26|Following his guidance, he arrived at the Fengyue place in Kaifeng City, the San Sheng Pavilion. He pushed the door open and saw a figure moving behind the screen in the hall, so he immediately flew towards it. In the dark corner, Shen Suan Zi was fighting with the figure and started discussing the Dao.
0:9:32|0:9:51|The two chased each other for a long time, until they reached a brightly lit place inside the building and finally learned each other's identities. Then [Dao Yichang] spoke up. The hand pressing against the opponent's chest felt like a wind fish, so he quickly withdrew his stance.
0:10:3|0:10:19|Dao Yichang pulled the beard under the Taoist's box, and the mask immediately loosened. Seeing this, the Taoist adjusted it himself, revealing a face as beautiful as a falling rain and flying geese. Dao Yichang was stunned.
0:10:41|0:10:46|Muttering the word "Jiaojiao" under his breath, [Dao Yichang] rushed up to the top floor attic.
0:11:32|0:11:35|The beauty spoke, and with a light pull, she sent that delicate chain out of the window.
0:11:51|0:11:54|Jiao Jiao's face contorted and transformed into a man's appearance.
0:12:7|0:12:28|Upon hearing movement in the barrel in the room, the beauty stopped engaging with the two men and went to the side of the barrel to investigate. As she approached, she found that the clear water inside was moving without any wind, which was quite strange. Looking up at the painted wall in the room, she saw a group of fish playing in the water, with a three-eyed carp looking nervous, realizing that the strange fish from earlier was hiding among them.
0:12:29|0:12:49|His face turned pale, his gaze darkened, staring intently at the strange fish. Sure enough, when the strange fish saw that its whereabouts were exposed, it tried to escape by casting a spell and flying out of the painting wall. But a beautiful woman suddenly conjured up a large net out of thin air, blocking the escape route of the strange fish and binding it within. She then used her magic to compress the body of the strange fish to the size of a palm and struck it fiercely several times.
0:12:49|0:12:53|After the strange fish behaved obediently, he looked towards [Dao Yichang] and [Xiao Yuan].
0:13:21|0:13:26|The beautiful woman felt helpless, and with a glance, her eyes fell on a painting again.
0:14:19|0:14:26|The beauty waved her hand and erased Zhuge Qingyun's memory. When he woke up again, he found himself in front of a pancake stall.
0:15:14|0:15:50|In the second episode "Trouble at the Misty Shadow Gate" of the movie, as the vendors taunt the Knife Fish Factory, the scene shifts to the hiding place of the Misty Shadow Gate. At a long table, one of the Misty Shadow wives, [Gui Jianchou], is copying the Qingming Riverside Scene. He remarks that this painting is based on Kaifu's work, with two buildings on each side of the river, creating a shadow out of nothing. Please like, subscribe, share, and support the Mingjing and Diandian programs.
0:16:26|0:16:32|The man with long hair is the head of the Mist Shadow Gate. The two avoided the gaze of the hanging fish and continued to communicate.
0:16:56|0:17:5|As the two were talking, a loud noise echoed throughout, and a dragon ball fell on the detection device of the formation. Seeing this, [Zhuge Qingyun] couldn't help but be amazed.
0:17:9|0:17:31|The scene shifts to the outskirts of Kaifeng City, where one of the wives of the blacksmith [Shunfeng Er] overhears the orders from Senior Sister [Iron Dragonfly] and taps on the ironware to secretly inform the other brothers in the outskirts market. They notice the paralysis around them and a strong man weaving a bamboo dragon, instead of a painter. We have always suspected that the fire two days ago was related to the demon.
0:18:16|0:18:18|So the former sect leader left behind his last words.
0:18:36|0:18:46|He received a box in a teahouse in Luoyang, with the name of a weapon on it, which turned out to be the legendary divine artifact, the Divine Miracle.
0:18:55|0:19:14|Speak up, take out a bronze plate from the waist, place it in the palms and twist it. After a burst of cracking sound, the bronze plate stands in the air, turning into a bronze ball the size of a human head, with countless words inscribed on it. Seeing this, the senior brothers all gathered around, waiting for the orders of Master Guo.
0:19:51|0:20:5|Leaving the strange fish in the base to divert the enemy's attention, the orders were given and everyone followed suit. Iron Dragonfly displayed his supernatural powers and marked the pillars in the mansion.
0:20:13|0:20:39|The incident came to an end, and the scene shifted to the front of the most famous medical hall in Chang'an City, where a blind physician was muttering to himself. The physician, carrying a bamboo staff and a bag, wearing a pair of sunglasses, walked gracefully towards the medical hall, exuding a sense of avant-garde.
0:20:39|0:20:42|The movie "The Third Return" begins with Qimen seeking the escape armor.
0:22:7|0:22:10|After informing the knight about this, the curator said.
0:22:53|0:22:57|Upon hearing this, the Boss ordered his men to bring the doctor up.
0:23:36|0:23:42|She can not only do housework with one hand, but also lift up ten big men with the other hand.
0:25:27|0:25:42|Opened the iron gate, under the escort of a group of medical management students, the physician walked alone towards the deep underground prison. As the physician took a few steps, the supervisor quickly closed the iron gate and locked it with a click. A student whispered among the group.
0:25:56|0:26:6|Upon seeing the doctor entering the dungeon, he reached out and wiped in front of his eyes. Those hairy eyes returned to normal, revealing a hint of clarity and alertness.
0:26:7|0:26:27|He pushed open another iron door, only to find the stone walls inside covered with deep and shallow scratches, as if some giant beast had vented its madness and resentment on these rocks with sharp claws. But when [Zhuge Qingyun] looked down, there was no monster, only a charming and petite young girl of no more than twenty-eight years old.
0:28:4|0:28:9|Just as the two were teasing each other and the atmosphere was harmonious, they saw the box in front of them.
0:28:38|0:28:45|In the attic of the second floor of the tavern in the city, a young lady from an unknown family screamed, causing a sudden chaos in the street.
0:28:45|0:29:0|Following the gaze of the young lady, under the scorching sun in the city of Kaifeng, countless earthworms were surging at some point. Their bodies, as thick as crimson blood, intertwined with each other, either curled up or panic-stricken, wriggling on the dusty road, causing great panic among the people in the city.
0:29:1|0:29:21|The city wall of Kaifeng, the meteorite that came from outside the sky shattered at this moment. The meteorite first cracked inch by inch, then a demonic light appeared, tearing it apart alive. Countless blood-red flesh strips suddenly protruded from the cracks, and the next second the entire meteorite was completely shattered, and the monster emerged from it.
0:29:21|0:29:30|One could only see the body that was unlike any other, unafraid of human emotions, with only those intertwining and twisting red flesh strips. Their target is not us, but the ancestral temple.
0:30:1|0:30:5|The tremors gradually subsided, and the city guards began organizing a rescue operation.
0:30:19|0:30:27|The constable named Xiao Han arrived at the rubble, pushed aside the bricks, and found a small box of broken silver. At that moment, [Dao Yichang] said:
0:30:36|0:30:40|Then, [Dao Yichang] leaped down from the ruins and shouted:
0:30:45|0:31:0|The boy, so serious, seeing no one responding, Dao Yichang did not hesitate at all, and went straight towards the hole under the ancestral temple. After going deep inside, the sunlight was unable to shine in, so he lit a match and shouted again.
0:31:10|0:31:28|Iron Dragonfly was still thinking about the monster, with no intention to care about Dao Yichang. He changed to two junior brothers and continued on. Looking at Dao Yichang, he was also very bold, following the rushing passage that collapsed. They went all the way towards the depths of the underground.
0:31:28|0:31:35|So, it was not just luck. Two dazzling pearls shot out from the copper tube under his arm, illuminating the underworld.
0:32:17|0:32:34|Iron Dragonfly was paying attention to the old ghost's speculation while reaching out to the railway for a test, but was hit by an electric current and quickly withdrew his hand. At this moment, Dao Yichang arrived at the edge of the demon suppression formation along the underground crevice, holding a torch, and observed the few people below from a hole in the high cliff.
0:32:35|0:32:51|Unexpectedly, a cunning person fell from the crevice, broke through the wooden planks, and landed in the ruins not far from the Fu Yao Formation. The loud noise attracted [Iron Dragonfly] and the other two to quickly investigate. When they saw the person clearly, they couldn't help but exclaim.
0:33:3|0:33:14|Hearing a strange noise behind them, everyone turned to look at [Iron Dragonfly], and sure enough, the monster with bloody flesh strips all over its body was hovering in the air above the demon-suppressing formation.
0:33:14|0:33:32|Watching the huge monster flying in the void, [Iron Dragonfly] and the other two were not afraid, just staring at its every move. The monster stopped not far from the demon array, twisting its body full of meat strips to form four heads, with the extra meat strips gathering behind to resemble wings.
0:33:32|0:33:51|When his spell was finally completed, a terrifying blood light burst out from the monster's chest, almost illuminating the entire underground world. As if responding to this blood light, the iron ball located on the demon-suppressing formation also began to stir, and a sudden demon wind carried debris and dust swirling around the iron ball.
0:33:51|0:34:11|The fierce demonic energy immediately swept over the entire ancient battlefield, causing [Iron Dragonfly] and two others, along with Gao Yichang, to be almost unable to stand. The remaining sealing power of the ancient demon formation also dissipated under the pressure of this surging demonic energy. Looking at the sudden appearance of the demon, and noticing the increasingly loose seal of Fumo Town.
0:34:16|0:34:34|Alert like [Iron Dragonfly], naturally also noticed this point. Before the unexpected words finished, he took out a wooden handle from his waist, threw it into the air, and saw the wooden handle turn into a delicate iron bow. However, before [Iron Dragonfly] could draw the bow and shoot the arrow, the blood demon seemed to sense something and headed towards the three people from the Misty Shadow Gate.
0:34:34|0:34:39|The flesh strips all over the body began to shake violently, like an intimidating and impenetrable net.
0:34:39|0:34:58|The blood-red light on the chest of the demon suddenly dimmed, followed by an unprecedented burst of blood light, accompanied by unbearable laughter. The huge sound waves shook the entire ancient battlefield, and the visible sound waves rushed towards the people present.
0:34:58|0:35:14|Sharp laughter directly knocked down the three members of the Misty Shadow Gate and [Dao Yichang]. [Iron Dragonfly] and others still had some power left to protect their vital points. Unfortunately, [Dao Yichang], who was skilled in martial arts, couldn't withstand the successive attacks and ended up spitting blood and fainting.
0:35:14|0:35:23|The residual power on the Sword-Supporting Demon Array was exhausted, and the Blood Demon stopped laughing. The blood light on its chest flashed, attracting the iron balls in the array to itself.
0:35:24|0:35:44|Under the shining of the blood light, the iron ball was melted due to the void in kung fu, and the monster inside finally revealed its true appearance. It had a beastly appearance, with two huge flesh wings on its back and a body covered in rock-like growths. At first glance, it looked like a beastman clad in armor, exuding a more intimidating aura than the blood demon.
0:35:53|0:36:7|Shunfeng Er rushed towards the two monsters. Unexpectedly, before Iron Dragonfly could approach, the beast shook its wings and flew towards him. As they met, the beast folded its flesh wings and sent Iron Dragonfly flying out.
0:36:7|0:36:12|Following closely behind, [Boss] and his gang were also sent flying by the orc's attack, crashing heavily to the ground.
0:36:13|0:36:27|Their skills were no match for [Iron Dragonfly] behind them. With just one blow, they spat out blood, unable to fight back. Unwilling to give up, [Iron Dragonfly] forced themselves to stand up, dodged the fatal blow from the beastman, and took out an iron chain, trying to trap the beastman.
0:36:27|0:36:33|Little did they know that the orc was incredibly powerful. His divine ability, Iron Chains, only managed to restrain the orc for a few seconds before he broke free.
0:36:34|0:36:49|The skinny man regarded [Iron Dragonfly] as thunder, then immediately flipped him over with a palm, followed by a dim lake light shining on his palm, and a powerful and irresistible sharp force pulling [Iron Dragonfly] towards the skinny man's palm.
0:36:50|0:37:8|At this critical moment, Dao Yichang finally woke up and, without thinking, drew the long knife from his waist and slashed at the orc in front of him. The orc, who was distracted, had to throw down the iron jug and turned around to grab Dao Yichang's arm that was wielding the knife.
0:37:8|0:37:26|The monster's hand was still as hot as ever, in a split second, [Dao Yichang] lost sensation in his arm, and then the beastman, with one hand like a wing, directly cut off [Dao Yichang]'s left leg. Seeing this, [Iron Dragonfly] refused to delay, pounced and destroyed [Dao Yichang]'s body, only to be left with a meaty arm that had been bitten by the beastman.
0:37:33|0:37:43|Iron Dragonfly and the others never expected the orc to be so powerful. With just one move, they were completely suppressed and had no way to fight back. In this situation, they had no choice but to retreat first and make a new plan.
0:37:44|0:37:59|Seeing the orc flapping its wings towards them, [Shunfeng Er] quickly took out several copper balls from his sleeve and threw them onto the surrounding stone walls. In the blink of an eye, explosions resounded, and the falling rocks instantly buried the orc. The three of them, along with [Dao Yichang], took advantage of the situation and escaped into the sky.
0:37:59|0:38:11|Not long after the group left, they saw the beastman break through the pile of rocks and fly towards the blood demon. The blood-colored demon floating in the air looked at the beastman and then spoke, expressing the desire for the beastman to merge with itself.
0:38:19|0:38:25|Hearing the Blood Demon speak like that, the Orc couldn't contain his anger and flung several huge rocks by flapping his wings.
0:39:11|0:39:31|Two monsters roared and left, the scene shifted to outside the Kaifeng Capture House.
0:39:35|0:39:40|Shunfeng Er and his junior apprentice, a burly man, leaped off the eaves to go and assist Iron Dragonfly and the others.
0:39:43|0:39:50|Upon hearing this news, [Iron Dragonfly] was extremely excited and quickly looked outside.
0:40:3|0:40:24|Standing at the door is the blind physician, who is also one of the wives of [Zhuge Qingyun]. Behind him is the young girl brought out from the medical hall, [Xiao Yuan]. Temporarily leaving [Xiao Yuan] behind, [Zhuge Qingyun] spoke.
0:40:35|0:40:51|Speak up, Nao Daoyang tilted his head back, and everyone followed his gaze to see the extremely timid girl. In the midst of these looks of extreme surprise, [Xiao Yuan] pressed against the back of [Zhuge Qingyun], her arms tightly wrapped around him.
0:41:8|0:41:19|Upon hearing what [Xiao Yuan] said, all the fellow disciples were stunned on the spot. [Iron Dragonfly] anxiously inquired in code, and [Zhuge Qingyun] was very certain.
0:41:32|0:41:47|[Zhuge Qingyun] tended to Dao Yichang's wound while responding with a nod. The scene then cut back to the image of the dungeon that day.
0:41:47|0:42:7|In the memory, [Xiao Mingxuan], who was swallowing food with big mouth, suddenly became extremely ferocious, with a shining light in his eyes. After a moment, countless feathers burst out from under his skin, illuminated by the thin sunlight in the dungeon. Those feathers, as if alive, slowly circulated with different colors.
0:42:7|0:42:26|Within the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, [Xiao Yuan] has transformed drastically, turning into a magnificent beast resembling a peacock, with sharp claws immediately closing in on [Zhuge Qingyun], who has no place to hide in the narrow dungeon. After a brief struggle, [Zhuge Qingyun] is overpowered by the beast, torn clothes and falling onto the stone steps.
0:42:31|0:42:59|At a critical moment, he suddenly realized that the shining spot between the monster's chest and abdomen was its vital point. He quickly pinched several silver needles and threw them directly at the monster's nose. As the silver needles entered its body, they temporarily blocked the monster's meridians. The huge body instantly dissipated, leaving only the naked [Xiao Yuan] limp in the arms of [Zhuge Qingyun]. Why were they hugging each other? Actually, no one has ever hugged me before, it felt quite nice.
0:43:2|0:43:7|After listening to his narration, the junior disciples all expressed doubt, with [Iron Dragonfly] being the most vocal.
0:44:35|0:44:40|Iron Dragonfly got really angry, let out a roar, and threw Xiao Yuan directly into Zhuge Qingyun's arms.
0:45:14|0:45:23|On a rainy night, the maimed [Dao Yichang] was abandoned on the street by his former colleagues. The pouring rain slowly diluted his last trace of body heat.
0:45:23|0:45:41|On the roof, the sulking [Iron Dragonfly] witnessed this scene, suddenly feeling a bit sorry. After the other constables left, he quietly walked to the side of [Dao Yichang], took off his own hat, and placed it on [Dao Yichang]'s face, without saying a word, just silently watching the man who had lost his hands and feet to save him.
0:45:42|0:46:2|The raindrops were cold, but [Iron Dragonfly] seemed to see the hidden fervor in the pale face of the man in front of him, as if sensing something. [Dao Yichang] struggled to open his eyes and looked at those somewhat vacant and desolate eyes. The softness in [Iron Dragonfly]'s heart was touched again, and she carried [Dao Yichang] on her back.
0:46:2|0:46:4|Brought back the temporary shelter for the Wuying people.
0:46:5|0:46:24|In the room, [Iron Dragonfly] was taking care of [Dao Yichang] with a hint of guilt. Seeing this scene, [Zhuge Qingyun] smiled lightly, standing outside the room. When [Iron Dragonfly] walked out of the room and gently closed the door with his own hands, [Zhuge Qingyun] looked deeply at [Dao Yichang] who had just put on his clothes, then asked [Iron Dragonfly] who had come to his side.
0:46:39|0:46:49|Saying that, [Zhuge Qingyun] took out a wooden box from his bosom.
0:47:48|0:47:55|[Zhuge Qingyun] was not sentimental at all, he slapped fiercely, feeling this unique affection, and both of them burst into laughter.
0:48:15|0:48:31|During the day, the Kaifeng city was in ruins after the earthquake, but at night, under the moonlight, it was still bustling with people. The mysterious sound, passing through the desolate buildings, echoed in the deepest alleys of Kaifeng city, enticing the guests to immerse themselves in it.
0:48:32|0:48:38|Iron Dragonfly paid no attention to these, changed into the attire of a noble son, and entered the pavilion, looking around with amusement.
0:48:41|0:48:48|Upon seeing Iron Dragonfly, Jiaojiao couldn't care less about her image and directly screamed out loud.
0:49:9|0:49:22|With a sigh, Gui Jianchou stood with Xiao Yuan, waiting boredly. Xiao Yuan pointed at the heavily made-up girls and asked him why their eyes were blurry and mouths full of blood. Were they all injured?
0:50:52|0:51:5|After obtaining the information left by the sect leader, the two of them returned to the temporary base and informed everyone. After discussing the relevant plans, the group then packed their bags and prepared to head to Luoyang. [Shunfeng Er] turned to the senior brothers and said.
0:51:14|0:51:25|In the carriage, [Xiao Yuan] called out to [Zhuge Qingyun], pointing to the fragrance of Mu beside her. On the other side, [Iron Dragonfly] also made plans for [Dao Yichang].
0:52:27|0:52:42|The so-called special equipment turned out to be a pair of metal arms and legs. Watching [Dao Yichang] struggling to adapt to the new limbs, a hint of guilt flashed across the handsome face of [Iron Dragonfly]. He knew that the favor he owed could not be repaid so easily.
0:52:54|0:53:5|Having lost his memory, he naturally doesn't remember that his sword has been left under the Taizu Temple. Without a word, the group left Kaifeng City under the cold night, heading towards their destination.
0:53:5|0:53:16|Entering the dense forest, the tranquility and vitality along the way slowed down the pace of everyone, allowing them to feel the brief peace around them while also being wary of the upcoming unknown bloody battle.
0:53:51|0:54:2|Dao Yichang's mouth twitched a few times, forcing a smile as he said. Xiao Yuan was very excited, leaning out of the carriage and shouting at the beautiful scenery around.
0:54:13|0:54:20|The sudden farce relaxed everyone a bit. [Boss] leaned over and said to [Iron Dragonfly].
0:54:29|0:54:45|After listening to what [Boss] said, [Iron Dragonfly] smiled slightly, indicating his agreement. The scene then shifted to the Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang, where the fourth episode of the movie "The Martial Arts Meeting the Divine Machine" began. Under the towering Buddha statue in the grotto, a figure in coarse cloth lay on the ground and spoke.
0:55:41|0:55:56|The five sect leaders gathered around the rough cloth Taoist, only to see the Taoist holding a huge box in his hands, and then pushing it open with force. Seeing this, [Cloth Old Yanwang] questioned.
0:56:45|0:56:55|During the performance, the Eternal King of the Underworld finished speaking and expressed his desire to exchange the box in the hands of [Tangmen Tangkun]. This was stated by the leader of the Bang gang, [Ba Bi Yuan].
0:57:5|0:57:21|Ba Bi Yuan used his divine power on the Divine Machine, turning it into a clear spring wrapped around his hand. However, in the blink of an eye, the spring naturally turned into a fiery appearance and was taken away by [Master Liehuo].
0:57:21|0:57:28|So, in the Longmen Grottoes, the flames were blazing, and the divine machine transformed into its final form, turning out to be a divine weapon made of metal.
0:58:3|0:58:9|Speak up, with the gleam of wisdom in his eyes, [Shen Suan Zi] spoke as the leader of the [Diancang Sect].
0:58:26|0:58:47|The supernatural power expanded, [Leader of Diancang Sect] instantly fell into a void. Tell me, those countless blood-colored flesh strips emerged from [Liu Mocan]'s body, directly shattering the void space that [Shen Suan Zi] used to bind himself.
0:58:47|0:59:5|It was the blood demon from the meteorite from the sky. Sensing the sudden surge of demon energy, the five sect leaders, along with [Shen Suan Zi], were stunned on the spot. However, another gust of demon wind swept by, snatching the Divine Mechanism from the hands of [Master Liehu]. Looking at his figure, he was the beast demon from the bottom of the ancestral temple, and only heard him speak out loud.
0:59:32|0:59:35|Feeling the changes in everyone's bodies, the Eternal King of Yan said.
0:59:45|0:59:53|As soon as they entered the garden, they saw Ba Bi Yuan's extraordinary powers surging. It was just as the demon had said. The leaders of the five major sects in the world now had to obey his commands.
0:59:53|1:0:3|Looking at the river in front of the stone cave again, under the influence of [Ba Bi Yuan]'s divine power, several water dragons condensed from it, heading straight towards [Shen Suan Zi], and the spiritual pearl in his hand was also snatched away by the Blood Demon in an instant.
1:0:4|1:0:19|[Shen Suan Zi] was shocked and dismayed. Meeting with the leaders of the five major sects today, he never expected such a scene. It was impossible to fight against the five powerful factions alone, plus the demonic people. The only plan now was to wait for an opportunity to escape and make new plans.
1:0:19|1:0:26|[Shen Suan Zi] transformed the paper umbrella in his hand into various forms, using it as a solid defense against the water dragon, but then heard the monster speak again.
1:0:29|1:0:45|The words are followed by actions. The immortal Yanwang showed fierce supernatural powers, transforming into a thick black mist with countless withered palms entangling and advancing towards [Shen Suan Zi]. Xuan Xian dodged the black mist and then saw a toxic hidden weapon from the Tangmen sect appearing above his head.
1:0:45|1:0:51|Shen Suan Zi could only use the shifting technique again, turning into a green smoke on the body of the giant Buddha and rolling around.
1:0:53|1:1:8|At this moment, Wu Dingfei's ring shattered the palm of the giant Buddha, smashing down on the wisp of green smoke. The Patriarch of the Fiery Flames unleashed a fiery palm strike, wrapping up the severed hand tightly. The scorching flames cracked the stone blocks apart, but there was no sign of [Shen Suan Zi] within.
1:1:52|1:2:8|The two monsters turned out to be from the outside world, resembling a white tiger and a redwood tree entwined with flesh and blood. The mysterious divine machine that drove the heroes of the martial arts world crazy was also intricately connected to these monsters. However, due to the passage of time, no one knows the full story anymore.
1:2:8|1:2:13|On the other side, deep in the desert, Iron Dragonfly and his group are heading towards Luoyang.
1:2:32|1:2:38|Speak up, [Zhuge Qingyun] began to search for the Ghostly Divine Manor. After an unknown period of time, the group arrived at a valley.
1:2:53|1:2:59|The group dismounted and prepared themselves as they entered the divine manor, with [Zhuge Qingyun] leading the way and giving reminders.
1:4:17|1:4:27|Iron Dragonfly flipped over and landed next to Dao Yichang, catching Zhuge Qingyun's eye. He then reached out and patted Xiao Yuan.
1:4:46|1:4:51|Upon hearing Iron Dragonfly's resentful words again, Xiao Yuan was stunned for a long time before speaking.
1:5:59|1:6:2|Dao Yichang looked at the scene and sighed.
1:6:55|1:7:11|Speak up, [Dao Yichang] limped away as if he had been educated. Watching him trembling, his fellow brothers couldn't help but smile. The storm outside continued to howl, and the dark clouds behind seemed to be nailed to the sky above the Shen Manor, without any hint of movement.
1:7:12|1:7:29|The atmosphere here seemed particularly eerie, and the sudden silence in the room made [Xiao Yuan] feel uneasy. She curled up in the box, holding a long-withered plant in her hand. Under her gaze, the wilted petals and curled leaves unexpectedly began to grow back.
1:7:29|1:7:43|Outside the box, [Zhuge Qingyun] seemed to sense something, and as he turned his head, he found the long-dead vines in the corner now bursting with vitality. Even more strangely, at the site of an amputated limb, unbearable pain erupted.
1:7:46|1:8:5|Just as he was examining the wound of [Dao Yichang], a sudden gust of wind swept through the entire divine manor, causing even the most ordinary candles to burn more fiercely than usual. Inside the box, [Xiao Yuan] seemed completely unaware, continuously channeling her powers into the flowers in her hands, feeling the intense demonic energy that almost engulfed the entire open field.
1:8:5|1:8:11|The disciples of the Wuying Sect became alert in an instant. [Zhuge Qingyun] then said to [Dao Yichang],
1:8:13|1:8:23|Afterwards, not daring to delay, Zhuge Qingyun gathered with many fellow disciples, hiding behind large rocks, right next to the surging demonic energy all around. Boss, holding an iron rod in hand, spoke up.
1:8:26|1:8:45|After a moment, the demonic energy wrapped in years of accumulated dead leaves and dust stirred within the entire gloomy Divine Mansion. The group abandoned the Divine Spirit, staying alert to every possible place where a demonic beast might appear. Just then, they saw the wooden box where [Xiao Yuan] was located violently shaking, causing loose stones on the cliff to fall down as well.
1:8:45|1:8:49|Feeling the strong demonic energy, the monster behind [Zhuge Qingyun] reminded.
1:8:53|1:9:7|Watching [Iron Dragonfly] again, standing alone under the stone wall, with a secret signal in hand, informing everyone that the demonic energy is strong, ordering everyone to prepare for battle. After seeing the hand signal, the senior brothers were inspired and quickly changed into battle attire, each looking for attack positions.
1:9:8|1:9:26|At this moment, the wooden box where [Xiao Yuan] was suddenly burst open, and a peacock-like monster laughed and emerged from it. Just as [Zhuge Qingyun] had seen in the dungeon that day, compared to before, this monster's momentum was even more impressive. Then, the monster's minions began to speak.
1:9:26|1:9:35|Looking at the huge monster in front of them, different from the ones seen under the ancestral temple, everyone was a bit stunned. [Zhuge Qingyun] was also at a loss, and Qianli Yan directly spoke up and asked.
1:9:40|1:9:51|As soon as the words fell, the monster rushed towards everyone. [Iron Dragonfly] couldn't dodge in time, was lifted by the monster's palm, hit the surrounding stone pillars, and fell heavily to the ground.
1:9:56|1:10:12|Seeing the monster charging towards him, [Iron Dragonfly] didn't hesitate and let [Dao Yichang] pull him up onto the armament. In this critical moment, [Zhuge Qingyun] arrived just in time, aiming straight for the monster's vital point with a vertical branch needle, only to be easily deflected by the monster's wings.
1:10:12|1:10:18|The next moment, the sharp claws directly pinned [Zhuge Qingyun] to the ground, leaving him helpless as he struggled against the monster.
1:10:21|1:10:36|Seeing [Zhuge Qingyun] in a dangerous situation, [Iron Dragonfly] leaped onto the back of the monster to engage it. Unexpectedly, although the monster was slightly affected, it managed to restrain [Zhuge Qingyun]'s attackers without letting up. Desperate to save him, [Iron Dragonfly] lost focus for a moment and was once again thrown by the monster, falling to the ground.
1:10:52|1:11:11|Finally, hearing the familiar call from the man, the demon's mind and consciousness became unstable, and all the demon power on its body dissipated in an instant. Even its huge body turned into ashes, with [Xiao Yuan] wrapped inside, just like the appearance in the dungeon that day, naked and unconscious, softly leaning in the arms of [Zhuge Qingyun].
1:11:12|1:11:21|On the other side, Dao Yichang climbed to Iron Dragonfly's side to show concern, but Iron Dragonfly's gaze remained on Zhuge Qingyun, who was taking care of Xiao Yuan.
1:11:26|1:11:31|Seeing Zhuge Qingyun looking at him, Dao Yichang quickly withdrew his hand from Iron Dragonfly's shoulder.
1:11:33|1:11:42|Upon seeing Xiao Yuan regain consciousness, Zhuge Qingyun was about to say something, but Iron Dragonfly approached him, so he didn't speak and just looked at him.
1:11:48|1:12:6|After exchanging greetings, everyone prepared to leave. Seeing that [Xiao Yuan] was not being troubled, [Zhuge Qingyun] finally coughed uncontrollably into the lung fluid in the dry warehouse. Without saying a word, everyone rushed to Luoyang City overnight. The place was bustling with people, crowded and lively, presenting a prosperous scene.
1:13:0|1:13:4|Passing through the bustling crowd, everyone arrived at an inn to take a rest for a while.
1:14:1|1:14:16|Perhaps out of guilt, Zhuge Qingyun's words were particularly sincere, and Dao Yichang's emotions were stirred. Since becoming a constable, Dao Yichang felt cared for for the first time. After calming his emotions, he replied solemnly.
1:14:18|1:14:27|Upon hearing his response, [Zhuge Qingyun] didn't linger and turned to walk downstairs. After a farewell gaze, he shook his head in confusion and headed towards the guest room.
1:14:27|1:14:36|At this moment, the wound at the broken weaving spot suddenly started to ache intensely again. Sitting by the bed in the room, [Xiao Yuan] quietly spoke up.
1:15:33|1:15:51|In the second-floor guest room, [Xiao Yuan] gently placed her palm on the shoulder where [Dao Yichang]'s severed limb was located, then tentatively guided her energy towards the wound. Seeing [Dao Yichang]'s strong reaction, fresh blood surged from the wound, the abdominal muscles retracted, and the heart muscles grew.
1:15:51|1:15:59|Xiao Yuan no longer hesitated, tightly grabbing Dao Yichang's shoulders with both hands, and then poured the surging divine power in her body into the wound.
1:16:0|1:16:14|Accompanied by Dao Yichang's uncontrollable screams, the wound where the limb was severed showed a mixture of bones and flesh, miraculously regrowing intact. At the same time, Xiao Yuan's already pale face had become completely bloodless.
1:16:28|1:16:53|Before he could even ask what was happening, he felt the piercing pain in his left leg wound. In his arms, [Xiao Yuan] forced her divine power to flow, causing blood to overflow from the top of her head. When the pain subsided, a new leg had grown out of his left leg.
1:17:7|1:17:25|Seeing [Xiao Yuan], who was almost fainting on the bed due to excessive consumption, [Dao Yichang] got up and walked towards the washbasin. However, as someone who had experienced limb regeneration, he was not yet accustomed to his new body and stumbled as he took the towel. After wetting it with clean water, he returned to the bedside and wiped the bloodstains off [Xiao Yuan]'s face before speaking.
1:19:18|1:19:28|Just as the two were feeling melancholic, Old Ghost noticed the secret signal from [Boss] in the food tray. Upon hearing this, everyone immediately perked up and looked towards the food tray.
1:19:30|1:19:43|Finally, the whereabouts of [Boss] were discovered, and everyone immediately set off to search among the bustling crowd. At the same time, both [Xiao Yuan] and [Iron Dragonfly] sensed something out of the ordinary.
1:19:43|1:19:56|Speak. [Iron Dragonfly] led his junior brothers to guard around the inn, while [Zhuge Qingyun] headed towards the room where [Xiao Yuan] lived. At that moment, two golden-copper flying rings suddenly appeared, it was the unique hidden weapon of [Tangmen Tangkun] - the Crownless Flying Rings.
1:19:58|1:20:11|On the second floor of the inn, [Xiao Yuan] was already in a daze, muttering incessantly. As the unpredictable flying ring was about to hit the secret door of [Zhuge Qingyun], the diamond finger wielded the shield and hammer fiercely smashed onto the flying ring.
1:20:11|1:20:26|With one strike, the two flying rings unexpectedly released countless attacks, shattering the big hammer in Iron Dragonfly's hand and causing him to suffer a heavy blow, spitting out blood. For a moment, numerous flying rings were flying around the inn, Tangmen Tangkun controlling the unpredictable flying rings and attacking everyone recklessly.
1:20:27|1:20:38|Seeing the situation, [Qianli Yan] and [Chuanshan Jia] kicked [Tangmen Tangkun] onto the scaffolding, hoping to restrain him. Even [Shunfeng Er] joined in, using various magical techniques and spells towards [Tangmen Tangkun].
1:20:38|1:20:53|It was only Tangmen Tangkun's powerful Taoist skills that the others fought desperately against, only to be defeated one by one. Then, as if commanded by a master, he led his men to drive them back. Seeing this, Zhuge Qingyun did not dare to delay, flew up to the second floor, only to be pulled down by Dao Yichang.
1:21:0|1:21:14|Hearing the urgency mentioned by [Dao Yichang], [Zhuge Qingyun] immediately put [Xiao Yuan] on his back and prepared to leave. At the same time, [Iron Dragonfly] blended in with the bandits, went straight in with a single sword, avoiding the flying rings around, directly entered the formation, and engaged in close combat with [Tangmen Tangkun].
1:21:14|1:21:26|Unexpectedly, Tangmen Tangkun's martial arts skills were also exceptional. After just a few moves, he found an opening and managed to inject the poisonous mist into Iron Dragonfly's arm. With this blow, Iron Dragonfly fell into the inn and was unable to continue the fight.
1:21:56|1:22:5|During the argument between the two, [Dao Yichang] was anxious and sat on the ground with his left foot, only to find that the force of this foot pushed him directly into the air.
1:22:5|1:22:19|At the moment of landing, Dao Yichang unexpectedly stood in front of Zhuge Qingyun and Iron Dragonfly. The unsteady flying ring, as strong as gold and stone, was just a palm's distance away from him. Dao Yichang was greatly shocked but helpless, so he squeezed his eyes, raised his hands to block in front of his face.
1:22:19|1:22:34|Unexpectedly, the anticipated heavy blow did not come. When he opened his eyes, he found that the unpredictable flying rings were actually under his control, stopping in front of the three people. Dao Yichang tentatively waved his hand, and the flying rings directly hit [Tangkun], smashing him into a shop in the market.
1:22:37|1:22:53|Speak up, without waiting for the others to investigate the reasons, they were ready to retreat. [Zhuge Qingyun] said no more. Carrying [Xiao Yuan] on his back, he immediately walked towards the outside, climbed over the inn's wall. [Iron Dragonfly] looked around, but did not see [Dao Yichang]'s figure, so he turned to [Zhuge Qingyun] and said.
1:22:56|1:23:13|The two of them then looked in the direction of the inn for a long time, [Iron Dragonfly] hesitated for a moment and spoke. Meanwhile, [Dao Yichang] was confronting [Tangkun], watching as [Tangkun] approached step by step, leaving [Dao Yichang] no choice but to defend himself forcefully.
1:23:13|1:23:24|Just at that moment, his newly grown left leg, as if unconsciously, did not obey commands and unintentionally stepped on a bamboo stick. With a kick from him, the bamboo stick directly hit [Tangkun]'s face.
1:23:24|1:23:32|Following that, [Dao Yichang] clapped his hands and flew into the air, then astonishingly delivered a heavy blow with his head, knocking [Tangkun] down to his knees on the ground.
1:23:34|1:23:42|On the other side, as Iron Dragonfly and Zhuge Qingyun just emerged from the alley, they saw a carriage speeding towards them and coming to a smooth stop right in front of them.
1:23:59|1:24:16|Accompanied by three people, [Shen Suan Zi] drove the carriage forward with a crack of the whip, while [Dao Yichang] was still entangled with [Tangmen Tangkun]. [Dao Yichang] showed no fear as he advanced straight towards [Tangmen Tangkun], leaving the sect leader [Tangmen Tangkun] struggling against the young man before him.
1:24:16|1:24:31|[Dao Yichang] reached out and restrained [Tangmen Tangkun], lifting him up in the air, unable to move. At that moment, [Master of the Blazing Fire] suddenly arrived and without hesitation, unleashed a fierce blaze that quickly burned [Tangmen Tangkun] to ashes, while [Dao Yichang] remained unscathed.
1:24:40|1:24:55|[Master of Fierce Fire] needs no further introduction. The surging divine power has elevated the might of [Master of Fierce Fire] to its peak, then he dashed towards [Dao Yichang]. At this moment, [Dao Yichang] was gradually adapting to his new power and fearlessly moved forward to meet the strike of [Master of Fierce Fire].
1:24:55|1:25:5|The moment the two made contact, the red flames on [Master of Fierce Fire] could not penetrate [Dao Yichang]'s body, but instead caused great harm to [Master of Fierce Fire], enveloping him in flames and causing unbearable pain.
1:25:5|1:25:28|Dao Yichang, upon seeing the situation, struck with a palm, knocking him down from the air and crashing into the ground. In the blink of an eye, the crimson flames reduced the Grandmaster of Fierce Fire to a handful of chicken powder. Meanwhile, Shen Suan Zi led Iron Dragonfly and two others to the outskirts of Luoyang City. The fifth episode of the movie "The Destruction of the Wuying Sect" officially begins.
1:25:28|1:25:35|Several people walked to a remote corner, only to see [Shen Suan Zi] transform himself into the [Boss] of "Shadow Gate", causing [Iron Dragonfly] to exclaim in surprise.
1:25:55|1:26:1|So now, [Boss] is watching the circle where [Xiao Yuan] is placed not far away, and speaks up.
1:26:1|1:26:20|Just as he was about to continue, [Iron Dragonfly] seemed to have a sudden realization and gestured to [Boss] to be quiet. Then, he used sign language to communicate with [Boss] for a long time, staring at the ever-changing movements of Iron Dragonfly's hand. [Boss] seemed to understand the meaning of his actions, and promptly took out a piece of cloth from his pocket and wrote on it.
1:26:21|1:26:31|Seeing the words on the cloth and witnessing [Boss] being so certain about [Xiao Yuan]'s identity, [Zhuge Qingyun] felt a moment of confusion. He stared at the circle drawn by [Xiao Yuan] for a while, before finally speaking up.
1:26:39|1:27:1|This has nothing to do with whether you believe it or not. I know you too well. [Xiao Yuan] who stopped [Zhuge Qingyun] from going to the result, [Iron Dragonfly] walked up by himself, because he helped [Dao Yichang] regain his limbs. At this time, [Xiao Yuan] was already exhausted, lying against a tree completely unable to move, only watching [Iron Dragonfly] with a cold expression.
1:27:1|1:27:7|Approaching step by step towards himself. Squatting down in front of [Xiao Yuan], [Iron Dragonfly] spoke.
1:27:41|1:27:54|After saying these words, [Xiao Yuan] held up [Iron Dragonfly]'s poisoned left arm, using her limited divine powers to force the toxins out of his body. It seemed to touch [Iron Dragonfly], who choked up and said.
1:27:54|1:27:59|On the other side, [Zhuge Qingyun] stared fixedly at [Boss] beside him, recalling the scene of [Iron Dragonfly] leaving just now.
1:28:1|1:28:21|When [Iron Dragonfly] blocked himself from approaching [Xiao Yuan], he gestured with his hands on his abdomen. The nearby [Boss] couldn't understand the secret language of "Wuyingmen". [Zhuge Qingyun] immediately shouted out, realizing his identity was exposed, the person no longer concealed himself and immediately used his skills to force [Zhuge Qingyun] back. Seeing this, [Iron Dragonfly] spoke up.
1:28:27|1:28:42|Currently, [Xiao Yuan] is extremely weak, like a mosquito, unable to stop [Iron Dragonfly] at all. In the air, [Iron Dragonfly] throws out flying knives towards the fake [Boss]. But the person remains calm, with a flick of his sleeve, completely reversing [Iron Dragonfly]'s attack.
1:28:42|1:28:51|The flying knives were actually heading towards Iron Dragonfly. Seeing Zhuge Qingyun in a hurry, he flew in front of Iron Dragonfly and used the bamboo staff in his hand to shatter those flying knives one by one.
1:28:52|1:29:6|Immediately displaying his supernatural powers, he transformed into a thick smoke surrounding himself with [Iron Dragonfly], waiting for an opportunity to escape. Jia [Boss], seeing the two disappear without a trace, paid no attention and instead galloped towards [Xiao Yuan], his imposing momentum causing the surroundings to wither overnight and the earth's veins to tremble.
1:29:6|1:29:15|Just as the man was about to crash into Xiao Yuan, a figure suddenly sprang out from the ground and carried Xiao Yuan away from Boss Jia's attack range.
1:29:15|1:29:23|Suddenly appeared, [Xiao Yuan] stopped the person in the circle, turned around, and everyone finally saw that this person actually had the appearance of the boss of the door.
1:29:28|1:29:36|Speak up, the two's gaze gathered on the newly appeared [Boss], only to see him gesturing in sign language, indicating the two to protect [Xiao Yuan] and leave this place.
1:29:40|1:29:51|Verified the identity of [Boss], the two immediately took [Xiao Yuan] and left, while the fake [Boss] also approached them at this moment, revealing his true identity, which turned out to be one of the leaders of the Wudapai, the immortal Yan Wang.
1:30:2|1:30:18|The eternal Yanwang transformed into a dense black mist, entwined with countless wooden arms, swirling the surrounding dry leaves and dust, moving towards [Boss]. On the other side, [Boss] remained unfazed, responding with summoning numerous divine soldiers to engage in battle.
1:30:18|1:30:31|At this moment, several water dragons suddenly rose from the nearby river, piercing through [Boss] and the immortal Yanwang in the blink of an eye. [Boss] fell to the ground, with chaotic spiritual patterns inside his body, and a mouthful of blood gushed out.
1:30:55|1:31:15|Ba Biyun beckoned, summoning several water dragons once again, trapping Yan Wang, [Boss], along with [Zhuge Qingyun] and [Iron Dragonfly]. Then, he unleashed his divine powers, seemingly about to oppress these individuals to death. In the end, unable to hold on much longer, Yan Wang cursed with all his might.
1:31:15|1:31:22|Speak up, then was killed by Babiyun using his divine power, with all his meridians cut off. Seeing this, [Zhuge Qingyun] said to [Iron Dragonfly].
1:31:30|1:31:38|Under the pressure of the Water Dragon, [Iron Dragonfly] had a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth, and he turned to look behind him, only to find that [Boss] had long been motionless, so he spoke sadly.
1:31:59|1:32:4|Before his death, [Zhuge Qingyun] said so. Then he and [Iron Dragonfly] both passed away together.
1:32:18|1:32:35|Seeing his friends who had been with him day and night die in front of him, the hatred in [Xiao Yuan]'s heart had reached its peak. Under the fury, he laughed loudly towards the sky, and with a surge of strength from who knows where, he unleashed the hidden powers deep within his soul, spreading them throughout the entire forest.
1:32:35|1:32:50|[Zhuge Qingyun]'s bamboo staff, which he used before his death, was slightly trembling and floating in his heart, then he made a lunge that pierced Xiao Yuan's chest. In that split second of distraction, [Xiao Yuan]'s powers took over the water dragon controlled by Ba Bi Yuan.
1:32:50|1:33:8|In the blink of an eye, [Xiao Yuan] controlled those water dragons, piercing through the chest of Ba Bi Yuan. The forest finally returned to its former tranquility. As time passed slowly, almost losing consciousness, [Zhuge Qingyun] vaguely sensed that his vitality was gradually returning to his body.
1:33:8|1:33:14|After he fully regained consciousness, he found himself completely unharmed, without even a hair out of place, too rushed to think about what had happened.
1:33:19|1:33:24|After probing, it was discovered that [Iron Dragonfly] had actually survived, and [Zhuge Qingyun] quickly ran towards [Xiao Yuan].
1:33:34|1:33:47|[Zhuge Qingyun] could hardly believe that the girl in front of him, with her dry and disheveled hair and pale skin, was [Xiao Yuan]. As he held her in his arms, [Zhuge Qingyun] suddenly saw a scene left behind by the former sect leader.
1:34:41|1:34:51|Emerging from that memory, [Zhuge Qingyun] saw the withered body of [Xiao Yuan] in his arms, resembling a piece of burnt charcoal. Unable to contain himself, he called out her name.
1:35:19|1:35:26|[Xiao Yuan] didn't even have time to hug her beloved man again before her strength dissipated like unraveling silk.
1:35:38|1:35:56|It was probably the heart-wrenching cry of [Zhuge Qingyun] that woke [Iron Dragonfly] and [Boss] up in a daze. After checking on Xiao Yuan's condition and feeling the surging power within their bodies, the two knew that Xiao Yuan sacrificed herself to save everyone. For a moment, they were all speechless and silent.
1:35:56|1:36:7|After who knows how long, under the summons of [Boss], the brothers gathered in the woods. The bleak cold wind stirred everyone's emotions. After burying [Xiao Yuan] simply, [Iron Dragonfly] spoke up.
1:36:29|1:36:33|After personally placing the stone tablet on the grave, [Boss] slowly spoke.
1:36:46|1:37:1|Saying that, [Zhuge Qingyun] turned to look at [Dao Yichang] standing in the corner. [Boss], as if having planned it all along, gathered his energy in his palm and rushed towards [Dao Yichang]. For reasons unknown, [Dao Yichang] extended his arm and met [Boss] with a palm strike.
1:37:1|1:37:10|The two of them seemed to be evenly matched in their skills. After their palms clashed, the others of the same faction were forced back several steps. But it was [Boss] who spoke up.
1:37:29|1:37:42|One by one, the senior brothers walked up to [Dao Yichang] and kicked him in various vital spots on his body. Knowing it was part of the initiation ceremony, [Dao Yichang] had been prepared and silently endured it.
1:37:42|1:37:48|After the senior brothers left, Second Brother [Zhuge Qingyun] stepped forward. He first patted [Dao Yichang] on the shoulder, then spoke.
1:37:50|1:37:58|Soon after, a high whip kick was about to strike directly at [Dao Yichang]'s face, but the force stopped abruptly at the critical moment. [Dao Yichang] grinned and expressed his gratitude.
1:37:58|1:38:10|In the final challenge, it was the turn of Master Sister, [Iron Dragonfly], seemingly because the other senior brothers all spoke vulgarly. Feeling indignant, [Dao Yichang] saw that the newcomer was [Iron Dragonfly], so he shouted out.
1:38:13|1:38:21|Upon hearing this, [Iron Dragonfly] did not refuse. He took a few steps back, then with a running start, he flew and kicked [Dao Yichang] in the chest.
1:38:21|1:38:37|With this blow, [Dao Yichang], a seven-foot tall man, actually flew out into the air, not landing until he was out of everyone's sight, causing his fellow brothers to exclaim in surprise. [Iron Dragonfly] was also very puzzled, as his strength, after being infused by [Xiao Yuan], had become so powerful.
1:38:37|1:38:43|If it weren't for Dao Yichang also possessing Xiao Yuan's supernatural powers in his body, this kick might have scattered his soul.
1:38:44|1:38:56|The scene shifts to the outskirts of the city where the two demons are located. The sixth episode of the movie "The Return of the Shield Armor" officially begins, with Zhuge Qingyun and Iron Dragonfly on opposite sides, discussing the ownership of the Divine Mechanism.
1:38:56|1:39:8|At this moment, two giant stones suddenly appeared in the sky. One was controlled by [Boss] personally, while the other was controlled by [Iron Dragonfly], [Zhuge Qingyun], and [Dao Yichang] together. The giant stones coordinated with each other and smashed towards the White Tiger.
1:39:9|1:39:25|Feeling the fierce killing intent, [Zhuge Qingyun] roared and shattered the huge rock controlled by [Boss]. In this gap, another huge rock fiercely smashed onto [Zhuge Qingyun]. When [Zhuge Qingyun] lifted the rock, he was surprised to find four humans standing in the air, demonstrating the power of the shield armor.
1:39:26|1:39:38|[White Tiger] flew towards [Dao Yichang] in a fit of rage, only to see that [Dao Yichang] was surrounded by almost substantial supernatural powers at this moment. With the help of this, in less than three rounds, he knocked down [White Tiger] and pinned him to the ground.
1:39:38|1:39:54|The four members of the Chigeki Kenmuyou group were refreshed, so powerful that they did not dare to underestimate the enemy. They temporarily set aside their personal grievances with [White Tiger] and flew towards [Iron Dragonfly]. Seeing this demon moving so swiftly, [Iron Dragonfly] was first surprised, then immediately prepared for battle, engaging in a back-and-forth fight with Chigeki in the sky.
1:39:54|1:40:10|Chigeki was taken aback and dared not continue to entangle. Finding a loophole, he quickly retreated to [White Tiger]'s side. At this time, [White Tiger] was finding it difficult to resist the attacks of the four people, so he simply threw the Divine Machine to Chigeki. As a result, Chigeki integrated the Divine Machine and the Spirit Pearl, becoming the strongest weapon mother.
1:40:11|1:40:28|Preparing to launch a full-force attack to annihilate the four members of the Mist Shadow. Looking at the crumbling earth around them and the sudden strong wind that could even cut through the skin, Zhuge Qingyun and the others finally felt the power of the complete Divine Machine, secretly tightening their hearts. They didn't know if their own team of four could withstand this earth-shattering blow.
1:40:28|1:40:34|Seeing the small ball jetting out from the premonition machine, covered with blood-red flesh thorns, [Zhuge Qingyun] quickly shouted at [Iron Dragonfly].
1:40:37|1:40:46|Afterwards, regardless of his own safety, he flew directly in front of [Iron Dragonfly], hoping to use his own body to block this deadly blow for [Iron Dragonfly].
1:40:46|1:41:4|At this moment, as time seemed to stand still, amidst the raging fire, the selfless [Zhuge Qingyun], the panicked [Iron Dragonfly], all came to a halt. On the other side, around the freshly buried grave of [Xiao Yuan], a surge of vitality suddenly emerged, reviving the withered plants and trees nearby.
1:41:4|1:41:18|In an instant, a vibrant new life emerged. Moments later, a giant peacock monster, the true form of [Xiao Yuan], shining all over, soared into the sky from the tomb, flapping its huge wings and arrived at the battlefield in an instant.
1:41:18|1:41:37|Following that, using great supernatural powers, Zhuge Qingyun teleported the five private security guards to the ground, while engaging in a fierce battle with Chimu and Baihu. After their attacks were deflected, Chimu suddenly unleashed his flesh strips, wrapping them around Xiao Yuan, rendering her unable to move. He then prepared to launch the deadly blood-red sphere with the Divine Machine in hand, at that moment.
1:41:37|1:41:55|The White Tiger also flew into the sky, baring its fangs and claws as it charged towards Xiao Yuan's back. At the critical moment, Xiao Yuan once again displayed great supernatural powers, causing time and space to freeze. Then Zhou Shen released countless electric lights, breaking free from Chimu's restraints just as those blood-red spheres were about to touch him.
1:41:55|1:42:4|[Xiao Yuan] escaped from the area, but the white tiger charging from behind collided with those small balls, causing a massive explosion that reverberated throughout the entire airspace.
1:42:5|1:42:22|Mixed with flesh and blood exploding in mid-air, the initiator Akagi stood there in disbelief. It was during this moment of mocking the gods that [Xiao Yuan] seized the opportunity, immobilizing Akagi under her feet. Akagi howled in agony as Xiao Yuan carried him into the sky, using all his strength but unable to move.
1:42:22|1:42:36|For the first time, he felt the fear that penetrated his soul. Perhaps he had never imagined that death would come so close to him. [Xiao Yuan] adjusted the circle to the right angle, and with a little force, directly threw Chimu towards the area where the blood-colored small ball was floating.
1:42:36|1:42:53|It was just now that Chigoku wanted to annihilate the privacy of the hidden person, releasing a deadly weapon. Even before feeling the moment of contact with the red ball, a huge explosion buried Chigoku. In the heavenly palace, two huge blood-colored smoke clouds were the last impressions left in this world by two extraterrestrial beings.
1:42:53|1:43:4|After dealing with Chimu and Baihu, [Xiao Yuan] emerged from the thick smoke, already restored to her human form, looking at the [Xiao Yuan] she had buried with her own hands, now standing in front of her in good shape.
1:43:6|1:43:21|The fierce battle came to a halt, and everyone tightly embraced each other, their hearts filled with excitement and passion. They were not only celebrating the end of calamity for the world, but also feeling emotional about surviving the disaster together. The scene shifted to the secret base under the Wuying Gate at the outskirts of Kaifeng City.
1:43:21|1:43:32|The senior brothers, led by the new sect leader [Xiao Yuan], continue to shoulder the mission of safeguarding the people. A group of people gathered around the conference table, discussing the mysterious painting of "Along the River During the Qingming Festival".
1:43:39|1:43:55|After pasting two scrolls together, a dozen twisted and distorted characters appeared on them.
