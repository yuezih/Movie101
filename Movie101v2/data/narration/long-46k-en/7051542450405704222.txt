0:1:16|0:1:28|The eldest sister leaned against the desk in a windbreaker with her arms crossed, her long hair tied behind her head looking serious, and when all the plainclothes were hidden in the theater, it was already 5:07.
0:1:53|0:2:20|Hidden behind the stage, [Lin Xiaoyang] listened to the kidnapper's phone call and immediately ran towards the prop box backstage. At this moment, the elder sister standing by the monitor saw that a long-haired man wearing a headset also walked to the prop box and helped [Lin Xiaoyang] and her husband to stuff the travel bag into the box. After everything was sealed, they received thanks from [Lin Xiaoyang], and the actors then pushed the prop onto the stage.
0:2:33|0:2:40|As soon as it was placed down, the floor directly below opened instantly, and the tracker hidden in the suitcase lost its signal.
0:2:49|0:3:11|Uncle Zhi had already left from Big Sister's side. After spotting the suspect, he quickly ran towards the light trough. Fazai, disguised as a waiter, followed Big Sister's instructions and headed towards the high staircase. At that moment, Big Sister noticed through the monitor that the man with the earpiece had suddenly left the control room, so she immediately turned and left the room.
0:3:11|0:3:19|And Uncle Zhi, watching the suspect Little Dog who had already jumped onto the rooftop, immediately hid by the window and took out the small notebook he carried with him.
0:3:35|0:4:0|Big Sister saw the big dog pulling open the door of the stairwell while talking. Fa Zi quickly used his body to hit the door of the staff-only passage next to the rooftop. As soon as he hid inside, the long-haired man with earphones pulled open the door of the stairwell and turned in. Then he arrived at the rooftop.
0:5:2|0:5:28|He Zhi used the information in the notebook to pinpoint the weak spot of the big dog Alon with one blow. Unexpectedly, Jiahong suddenly stood up and slammed Alon straight towards the edge of the rooftop. As a result, Alon grabbed onto the cable on the side of the building during the fall, wrapping it around Jiahong's neck. When the elder sister and her people arrived downstairs, they saw both of them lying on the ground with their heads in a pool of blood covered with cash.
0:5:29|0:5:38|But not until Long gasped his last breath did he manage to ask where Lin Xiaoming was.
0:5:44|0:6:10|Lin Xiaoyang found herself on the rooftop at some point, tears streaming down her face as she asked He Zhi, "The wind on the rooftop has messed up my short hair." Under the clear sky, He Zhi seemed to have fallen into an ice cave, suddenly appearing in a cold and eerie little house. A man wearing medical gloves slowly unzipped a long bag on the table, revealing a young face. Lin Xiaoyang, who was initially composed, was taken aback.
0:6:11|0:6:40|Rapidly taking deep breaths to calm down, she then slapped the man's face, feeling unsatisfied with just one slap, she swung her arms and smashed into his chest. The person being hit was none other than [He Zhi], but he showed no intention of fighting back, just gritting his teeth and lowering his head, watching [Lin Xiaoyang] bend over and cry while clutching her coat, making the identity of the person in the bag obvious.
0:6:40|0:6:52|Time flies, three years have passed since the kidnapping case. [Lin Xiaoyang]'s husband [Liu Qian] is now in a wheelchair, and the two are at the dance hall checking the actors' movements.
0:7:8|0:7:16|Turning around, [Lin Xiaoyang] picked up the dance shoes beside him and threw them out the moment the actress approached.
0:7:26|0:7:34|Speaking, [He Zhi] gently pushed open the door, then sat down beside [Liu Qian],
0:8:2|0:8:33|[Liu Qian] smiled and took [Lin Xiaoyang]'s hand, tightly holding it. [Lin Xiaoyang] then walked up to [He Zhi], and together they were led by [Liu Qian] to the center of the dance floor. [He Zhi] was positioned opposite to [Liu Qian] and they both extended their hands to rest on [Liu Qian]'s shoulder. [Liu Qian] then grabbed their hands and crossed their arms, guiding them to pass in front of him and quickly arrive at the right side of [Liu Qian] where Ah Zhi had not yet stabilized.
0:8:33|0:9:4|Being confused by the reappearance of [Lin Xiaoyang] in front of him, who was not a professional dancer, [He Zhi] could only raise his hands and give up, smiling as he stepped aside. Then he saw the couple facing each other, raising their hands and swaying their bodies to the music. [Lin Xiaoyang] would bend his legs and waist, alternating his feet, one left and one right, leading [Liu Qian] in circles on the smooth floor with their hands, until finally...
0:9:4|0:9:12|Sitting sideways on [Liu Qian]'s lap, she smiled and wrapped her arms around his neck.
0:9:32|0:9:38|The memory ends as Lin Xiaoyang covers her tears and walks towards He Zhi.
0:9:59|0:10:16|Early the next morning, [Lin Xiaoyang], who was pouring water in the ward, stared blankly at a luxurious villa outside the window. The cover of a magazine beside him prominently featured the rags-to-riches story of the wealthy businessman [Wang Sen]. In a hurry, [Lin Xiaoyang] pulled [Liu Qian] to the door.
0:10:33|0:11:4|At this moment, [Lin Xiaoyang] arrived at a busy alley carrying a toolbox and two plastic bags. He stopped in front of a door with a mailbox, took out a key from inside, quickly unlocked it, then pulled out multiple wooden boards. Using a drill, he nailed them to the wall, placed a mattress on top, taped it securely, sealed the window, and finally pasted stolen photos on the walls inside the room.
0:11:5|0:11:9|The boy being secretly filmed is smiling brightly at the tycoon [Wang Sen], who looks like a primary school student.
0:11:38|0:11:58|[Liu Qian] is playing chess with [He Zhi] in the ward, while on the other end of the phone is [Lin Xiaoyang] disguised as a boy using a voice changer. Hearing [Liu Qian] deny it, she picked up the small book on the table with a smile.
0:12:18|0:12:28|With the help of a little assistant, the boy who was secretly filmed by [Lin Xiaoyang] quickly left the school cafeteria.
0:13:19|0:13:26|The boy being secretly filmed here is the son of [Wang Sen].
0:14:12|0:14:20|Haoxian secretly stuffed sugar into the cola bottle, and Dajie was instantly sprayed all over.
0:14:50|0:15:2|When Haoxian opened the door, he ran into a man and a woman head-on. The woman glanced at the elder sister first, then squatted down.
0:15:16|0:15:40|It turned out that the man was Haoxian's father. The older sister called out to Sally. Sally shook her curly hair, turned around, picked up her shoulder bag, and left the room.
0:16:4|0:16:10|The eldest sister originally wanted to continue speaking, but when she looked up and saw Haoxian leaning against the bedroom door frame, she instantly stopped talking.
0:16:10|0:16:43|After leaving home, Lin Xiaoyang arrived at the underground parking lot. Sally immediately opened the door and got out of the car. She then walked with her head held high to the passenger side where Lin Xiaoyang was sitting, knocked on the car window. Lin Xiaoyang slowly rolled down the window after hearing the knock. After listening, Lin Xiaoyang turned around and started the Jeep. Then she stepped on the gas pedal hard and drove straight towards Sally's car in front. Sally watched as her sedan...
0:16:43|0:16:58|Lin Xiaoyang bent down to check the bumper that had been hit, while He Wanzhen drove the car and stopped next to Sally. After speaking, she decisively left, leaving behind the resentful Sally.
0:17:8|0:17:14|Wang Jiaming shook off the maid's hand, then put on a baseball cap and walked angrily towards [Haoxian].
0:17:29|0:17:40|Two boys had just run into the public restroom when a long-haired man wearing sunglasses blocked the door, waiting for the boy with the hat to appear. As soon as he did, the man grabbed him and the other boy quickly hid.
0:17:55|0:18:0|Upon hearing the words of the eldest sister, [Wang Sen] quickly turned around and went to the office window to pull the curtains tightly.
0:18:23|0:18:43|[Wang Sen] slowly hung up the phone, his hands hanging weakly in front of him. His neatly groomed short hair was now in disarray. The police then set up surveillance in a high-rise building near [Wang Sen]'s villa. The eldest sister sat in a car by the side of the road with [He Zhi] and A Yao, monitoring the villa's gate. Every time was just delivering takeout.
0:18:56|0:19:1|The person who entered the villa turned out to be the delivery person.
0:19:5|0:19:27|After that, the eldest sister immediately opened the door and got out of the car, [He Zhi] then picked up the small notebook he carried with him and followed closely. Soon, the two of them passed through the garden of the villa and climbed onto a terrace, arriving at the billiard entertainment room. The police officers monitoring beside the entertainment room could only watch as the two entered the living room.
0:19:58|0:20:1|Faced with the gaze of [He Wanzhen], [Wang Sen] quickly averted his eyes.
0:20:28|0:20:39|It seems that the suspicion on the female secretary has been ruled out. Upon hearing Wang Sen's phone ringing, He Zhi quickly signaled to his colleague.
0:20:54|0:21:8|But what [Lin Xiaoyang] released was only a recorded voice. At this moment, [Lin Xiaoyang] stood by the hospital window and took out another SIM card to replace it, then dialed [Wang Sen]'s number again.
0:21:21|0:21:32|[Lin Xiaoyang] heard [Wang Sen] evade the question and immediately hung up the phone.
0:21:36|0:21:40|Lin Xiaoyang then took out a telescope to observe the surroundings of Wang Sen's house,
0:21:49|0:22:1|With his eyes wide open venting his emotions, [Wang Sen] heard [He Wanzhen]'s instructions and could only helplessly comply. Sure enough, the phone rang.
0:22:29|0:23:3|Upon hearing that the person on the other end of the line was actually an old acquaintance, [He Wanzhen], [Lin Xiaoyang] immediately closed his eyes, hung up the phone without saying a word, and when he opened his eyes again, it was as if he saw the chilling image of his own younger brother lying in the morgue. It seemed he was not the murderer. Unexpectedly, just as he was about to track down [Wang Sen], the phone rang again. From [Lin Xiaoyang]'s phone, [He Zhi] could hear the sound of a clock chiming.
0:23:3|0:23:12|Taking notes on the small notebook, [Lin Xiaoyang] made a guess.
0:23:47|0:24:15|[Wang Sen] hadn't even had a chance to speak harshly before [Lin Xiaoyang] simply hung up the phone. On the other side of the city, a bearded man pushed open the bedroom door of a small house, then ripped the cloth from the boy's mouth, tore off a piece of bread and stuffed it into his mouth. The man, whose finger was bitten, immediately threw the bread aside, then firmly grasped the boy's jaw.
0:24:15|0:24:17|He stuffed the cloth back into his mouth.
0:24:37|0:24:47|Afterwards, she gave a slight smile to the nurse and left the hospital, while the police were putting a tracker into the money bag.
0:25:6|0:25:30|[Lin Xiaoyang] didn't give [He Wanzhen] a chance to ask questions, so [He Wanzhen] had to let [Wang Sen] take the money and walk towards the garage together. After leaving the hospital, [Lin Xiaoyang] quickly started the car parked downstairs, then stepped on the gas pedal and drove into the driveway. Meanwhile, not far behind, [He Wanzhen] had also driven her car into the same lane, moving forward.
0:25:30|0:25:37|While observing the rear through the rearview mirror, [Lin Xiaoyang] also kept an eye on [He Wanzhen].
0:26:0|0:26:32|[He Wanzhen] smiled awkwardly at this, before she could explain, she was interrupted by a phone call. With a voice changer in hand, [Lin Xiaoyang] confidently revealed the meeting point for the exchange. [He Wanzhen] quickly headed to the expressway towards the laundry shop, with [He Zhi] driving not too far behind with A Yao. The other police officers, after hearing [Lin Xiaoyang]'s request, quickly disguised themselves as pedestrians and spread out around the laundry shop.
0:26:33|0:26:38|In the noisy laundry shop, [He Wanzhen] answered the phone.
0:27:6|0:27:22|After listening, [He Wanzhen] took a deep breath, first placed her phone on the chair behind her, then opened the lid of a washing machine and poured all the cash in. Then she quickly took off her shoes and socks on the side, threw the earphones on the ground, and [Wang Sen] also hurriedly took off his pants.
0:27:33|0:28:1|The two quickly took off their clothes in the store, attracting the attention of passersby outside the glass door. Just as [He Wanzhen] was about to take off her bra, [Wang Sen] quickly found a shirt to cover her chest. After [Wang Sen] took off his underwear, [He Wanzhen] started the washing machine with a coin, and the earphones emitted a piercing sound after being soaked, prompting the police lurking nearby to quickly remove the earphones.
0:28:4|0:28:33|While [He Zhi] took off his headphones ahead of time, complaints from residents came from the high-rise building in front of him. With a flash of inspiration, he left the spot. Inside the laundry room, [He Wanzhen] and [Wang Sen] anxiously awaited [Lin Xiaoyang]'s next instructions amidst the curious onlookers. Meanwhile, [Lin Xiaoyang] stood by the balcony inside the high-rise building, casually counting the number of police officers just stimulated by the sound of the headphones.
0:28:33|0:28:49|The sudden barking of dogs interrupted her smile. [He Zhi] somehow sneaked into the building and found herself in the hallway of a resident whose door was unlocked. A small dog was barking at her incessantly, so she had to quickly walk to the end of the hallway.
0:28:49|0:28:57|But at this moment, there was already no one there, back in the laundry room, the two had put on their clothes and retrieved the cash.
0:29:4|0:29:10|The female staff member called out on the intercom, [He Wanzhen], who then took it and smiled as she answered.
0:29:20|0:29:49|After grabbing the car keys, [He Wanzhen] immediately hung up the phone and ran outside, followed closely by [Wang Sen] who jumped into the car with a money bag. Just as they got in, a tablet on the armrest in the car lit up, displaying a map. Following the directions on the tablet, [He Wanzhen] turned the car onto the wrong side of the road.
0:29:55|0:30:15|The voice of [Lin Xiaoyang] suddenly came from the tablet. Realizing that there was no choice, [He Wanzhen] suddenly turned the steering wheel and drove straight into the depths of the road. Following closely behind [He Wanzhen], [He Zhi]'s car was instantly blocked from behind. [He Zhi], who had just entered the intersection, asked Ah Yao where the nearest vantage point was.
0:30:20|0:30:46|He quickly drove away, being controlled and disrupting traffic by [Lin Xiaoyang]. The police, who were originally driving behind [He Wanzhen], had to abandon their car and chase after. Meanwhile, [He Zhi] arrived at the mountaintop. By this time, [He Zhi] had climbed up to the mountaintop viewing path, and after lowering his gaze, he saw the winding road leading to the end.
0:30:46|0:30:56|[He Wanzhen] has already opened the door and got out of the car. After walking down several steps of the long street, [He Wanzhen] and [Wang Sen] arrived at a dense forest.
0:31:6|0:31:20|Watching [He Wanzhen] leaning against the tree trunk and gasping for breath, [Wang Sen] urgently urged her on. He then quickly checked his money bag and ran towards the edge of the woods. Just as he entered the pavilion, [He Wanzhen] heard the public phone ringing.
0:31:43|0:32:5|Continuously observing the surroundings with his eyes, at this moment [He Zhi] and Ayao ran down the long street to the park. Looking at the intersection with paths everywhere, [He Zhi] also hesitated for a moment.
0:32:6|0:32:34|A Yao discovered the mark on the tree, a thousand yuan bill folded into a square and inserted into the tree. The one who left the mark, [He Wanzhen], along with [Wang Sen], arrived at the ticket office. They gestured towards the ticket seller and silently received two tickets and a map. Looking at the map in hand, [Wang Sen] pointed towards the direction of the Torpedo Pavilion. The two walked through the dim underground passage, and [He Wanzhen] couldn't help but ask,
0:32:45|0:32:57|[Wang Sen] knocked him out with one palm, and with sweat all over his head, [Wang Sen] glanced at [He Wanzhen] lying limp at his feet before charging straight out of the underground passage.
0:33:1|0:33:30|[He Zhi] and Ayao had just arrived outside the pavilion when they heard the broadcast announcement. [He Wanzhen] secretly left her wallet behind, took a few steps, and just as [He Zhi]'s phone rang, he paused. Meanwhile, [He Wanzhen], who had been knocked unconscious, suddenly woke up, looked around the deserted underground passage, and quickly crawled to her feet and rushed straight towards the outside. At the same time, [Wang Sen] tightly held onto the money bag.
0:33:30|0:33:38|Arriving at the agreed torpedo tube, followed closely by a handsome young man, he nervously grabbed the money bag.
0:33:42|0:33:57|After finishing speaking, [Lin Xiaoyang] held up the phone in front of [Wang Sen]. At this moment, [He Wanzhen], who was anxiously waiting at the mountaintop, suddenly saw [He Zhi] running into the torpedo tube, and quickly took out her phone.
0:34:22|0:34:33|While [He Wanzhen] picked up the phone and looked at it, she suddenly collapsed to the ground. Sensing something was wrong, [He Zhi] immediately grabbed the young man's collar after glancing at the phone.
0:34:43|0:34:49|[He Wanzhen] heard the word "dam" and quickly snapped out of it, then rushed madly towards the torpedo pavilion, staring fixedly across.
0:35:5|0:35:19|On the opposite embankment, the kidnappers had already left. At this moment, [He Wanzhen] seemed to once again block out everything around her. Her originally well-kept long hair was now messy and scattered, with the wound on her cheek from [Wang Sen]'s slap particularly prominent.
0:35:19|0:35:40|Tourists were enjoying the early spring sunshine, but [He Wanzhen] felt like she was in an ice cave, with indescribable feelings in her heart, as if she had swallowed a pound of bitter gall. She wanted to spit out the bitterness, but it lingered at the tip of her tongue and she had to swallow it back, leaving her with a stomach full of bitterness standing still.
0:35:41|0:35:47|At this moment, [Lin Xiaoyang] entered the cabin and looked at the keychain in his hand, lost in thought.
0:35:58|0:36:8|The man with a beard, upon hearing that the kidnapped child is actually the son of a police officer, immediately grabbed a dagger and rushed towards the inner room.
0:36:17|0:36:35|The bearded man with raging anger heard this, slowly released the hilt of the knife, then turned his head and stood up to leave. [Lin Xiaoyang] also let out a sigh, almost kneeling on the ground. He casually picked up a towel and wrapped it around his hand, then glanced at Haoran, who was sitting against the wall with his eyes and mouth covered.
0:36:36|0:36:50|Calling three times with no response, Haoxian finally reacted. [Lin Xiaoyang] quickly untied the cloth strip wrapped around his mouth, took out the cloth ball from his mouth, and then swiftly laid him flat on the ground.
0:36:52|0:36:58|Pressing hard on his chest with both hands, occasionally stopping to lean down and breathe into his mouth.
0:36:59|0:37:13|[Lin Xiaoyang]'s blood seeped through the towel in his palm, quickly staining [Haoxian]'s shirt on the chest. Just as he was about to give up, [Haoxian] suddenly opened his cracked lips and couldn't help but cough a few times.
0:37:13|0:37:36|[Lin Xiaoyang] watched as [Wang Sen], who had finally come back to life, sat back in shock on the ground, continuously retreating. He then stared fixedly at the faint rise and fall of [Wang Sen]'s chest, realizing suddenly that the other party was gradually regaining consciousness. He clenched his fists tightly, slowly calming his own breathing.
0:38:0|0:38:24|[He Zhi] hurriedly stopped [Achi], and [He Wanzhen] walked into the office without hesitation, pulling down the curtains of the glass door. She sat down weakly at the office desk, the wound on her cheek had already festered, and the blood had long since congealed. She seemed completely unaware, took a few deep breaths, and then saw the trembling hand in front of her press a few times on the landline phone.
0:38:24|0:39:7|Placing the earpiece back to her ear, [Wang Sen]'s tender voice kept coming through the earpiece. [He Wanzhen] couldn't control her emotions anymore, tightly gripping the earpiece and sobbing uncontrollably. But this was the office, surrounded by colleagues. She fiercely bit her lip, preventing herself from making louder noises. Then, she quickly covered her mouth with her other hand. The earpiece, originally placed next to her ear, was now pressed against her shoulder, without her realizing when it had shifted.
0:39:7|0:39:22|Then she put the phone back on the desk, as if this action also brought [He Wanzhen]'s lost rationality back. As she looked up, she first saw the mountain of folders on the desk, and then glanced at the scattered sticky notes under the computer screen.
0:39:22|0:39:39|Although reason told her that as a police officer she needed to remain professional, emotionally, as a mother, perhaps there is no mother in the world who can remain calm when her child is kidnapped. In the end, reason prevailed, and [He Wanzhen] quickly wiped away her tears and abruptly left the office.
0:39:42|0:39:48|Everyone, like [He Wanzhen], quickly picked up the listening devices as if facing a major enemy.
0:40:1|0:40:7|[Achi] took off his headphones and quickly ran towards the young couple brought back from the scene.
0:40:39|0:40:48|Shifting their gaze away from the couple, they fixedly looked at [Achi], as two men walked into the room.
0:41:29|0:41:53|The glare of the flashlight instantly covered his originally resolute eyes. Seeing this, after giving a glare at [Inspector Luo], [Ah Chi] put his arm around [He Wanzhen]'s shoulder and walked towards home together. As night fell, [Inspector Luo] led a group of police officers to Haoxian's house. After giving instructions, [Ah Chi] turned back to the living room.
0:42:3|0:42:13|Then he took out a lottery ticket, went to the table, opened his laptop and entered a website, staring at the numbers on it.
0:42:16|0:42:38|[Achi] got up and walked towards the direction of the restaurant. He took the lottery ticket from under the fridge, was about to turn around, but suddenly stopped in his tracks. Then, with empty eyes, he took out a piece of paper from above and slowly handed it to [He Wanzhen], who was sitting in the living room, after we had a fight yesterday.
0:42:56|0:43:9|[He Wanzhen] clenched the piece of paper tightly, as [Achi] finished speaking and slowly turned around. After glancing at [He Wanzhen], he gritted his teeth and said, [He Wanzhen] lowered her hand from her forehead and replied softly,
0:43:37|0:43:47|After pursing his lips, [Zhou Zhaochi] gathered his courage and said,
0:44:0|0:44:27|[He Wanzhen] was completely unaware of this, but as she looked at [Achi] nodding silently, she could only continue listening. [Achi] gazed at [He Wanzhen] with moist eyes, but [He Wanzhen] sighed. On the restaurant wall, the words twisted and turned by Haoxian were highlighted by the light, very eye-catching.
0:44:27|0:44:48|[He Wanzhen] pursed her lips, snatched the lottery ticket from [Wang Sen]'s hand, and sat down in front of the laptop. [Wang Sen] also moved next to her.
0:45:8|0:45:18|[Lin Xiaoyang] stopped flipping through the documents, bent down and held the hand of the patient on the bed, with elbows in front.
0:45:33|0:45:41|As soon as the words fell, [Lin Xiaoyang] saw [He Zhi] walking into the aisle through the window.
0:46:12|0:46:23|[He Zhi] had just decided to put down the water cup handed by [Lin Xiaoyang], but caught sight of [Wang Sen]'s brightly lit house outside the window. After a moment of contemplation, he turned and walked out of the hospital room.
0:46:32|0:46:38|[Lin Xiaoyang] wrapped his coat around himself.
0:47:1|0:47:9|[Lin Xiaoyang] stood still and turned to look at [He Zhi]. [He Zhi] nodded, then turned and walked away.
0:47:14|0:47:43|Before I could say anything, I heard this sentence. In the blink of an eye, the sun had set. Inside the cabin, [Liu Qian] was still blindfolded and gagged. Although his hands were handcuffed behind his back, he managed to touch an iron nail while moving. The next morning, [Zhou Zhaochi] prepared breakfast as usual. He took a bottle of milk from the fridge and intended to pour it into a cup. When he turned around, he saw three plates of neatly arranged eggs and ham on the stove.
0:47:44|0:48:5|At that moment, he realized that [Liu Qian] was not at home. He sighed and poured one of the dishes into the sink. [He Wanzhen] leaned against the kitchen door, lost in memories. Meanwhile, [Liu Qian] was sitting at the dining table, playing with a small robot using a remote control key, only to accidentally drop it into the milk.
0:48:18|0:48:47|Looking at the small robot still on the dining table, [He Wanzhen] took a deep breath, bent down and picked it up. [Zhou Zhaochi] then made an effort to smile as he walked into the dining room. Fa Zi immediately walked out of Liu Qian's room and into the living room. [He Wanzhen] glanced at the front door, then gestured with her eyes for [Zhou Zhaochi] to go check it out, before leaving the table, turning sideways, and hiding behind the wall.
0:49:28|0:49:34|Before Sally could finish speaking, [He Wanzhen] went straight past her and embraced [Zhou Zhaochi], kissing him.
0:49:41|0:49:50|After throwing the bag to [Zhou Zhaochi], [Lin Xiaoyang] left without looking back. Hearing the door close, [He Wanzhen] moved the hand resting on [Zhou Zhaochi]'s shoulder.
0:50:33|0:50:41|In the end, she closed her eyes tightly, held back tears, and left without looking back after slamming the door.
0:50:41|0:51:6|Just arrived at a parking lot, a boy rushed over and handed a paper bag to [He Wanzhen]. After that, he turned and ran away. [He Wanzhen] lowered her head and pinched what was in her hand. She opened the car door, got in, and quickly opened the bag. Suddenly, a blood-stained shirt fell out. [He Wanzhen] instantly realized that it was [Liu Qian]'s school uniform.
0:51:6|0:51:22|She fiercely crumpled the school uniform into a ball, her finger joints tightening and turning white. Then she pressed the school uniform tightly against her chest. At this moment, a cell phone rang from the paper bag, so she immediately searched for it and took it out.
0:52:27|0:52:39|[He Wanzhen] nodded repeatedly after listening, tears streaming down like a spring. [Lin Xiaoyang] seemed to have been drained of strength, leaning back and resting his head on the seat.
0:52:46|0:53:6|Colleagues looked at [He Wanzhen] who returned to work and nodded in greeting, but she didn't linger, heading straight to her office. She observed her colleagues outside through the glass door for a while, then raised her hand to pull down the curtains, blocking the outside view. She then opened a drawer and took out something from inside.
0:53:10|0:53:42|Inspector Chen quickly crossed the crowd and walked towards the office, only to find that He Wanzhen, who was there just now, had disappeared. It turned out that He Wanzhen had gone to the evidence room. As the police officer took the materials from He Wanzhen and picked up the keys to walk towards the evidence room, He Wanzhen also moved to the door, watching as the police officer squatted down to select the evidence one by one. However, when the police officer turned around, He Wanzhen's figure was nowhere to be seen.
0:53:54|0:54:14|[He Wanzhen] was hiding in another room in the evidence room at this time. He heard the sound of the police closing the door and leaving. He crouched down and stood up, walking to the door of the evidence room. Then, he opened the door directly. It turned out that he had intentionally placed a piece of paper in the door jam so that he could enter after the police left.
0:54:15|0:54:36|When the police officer from the evidence room walked into the office, Chief Chen quickly asked him. At this moment, [He Wanzhen] finally saw the item she had been looking for - a large amount of cash in big bills sealed in plastic bags. Just then, Chief Chen, accompanied by the police officer from the evidence room, briskly pushed open the door to the stairwell and headed towards them.
0:54:36|0:54:44|[He Wanzhen] closed her eyes tightly, propped herself up and walked towards the evidence room, turning her head.
0:54:58|0:55:33|[He Wanzhen] looked up at Chief Chen with the evidence in hand, then the two returned to the office. Chief Chen took a sip of hot coffee, looked across and said, [He Wanzhen] lowered her head to look at the disposable paper cup in her hand, then took out a phone and handed it to Chief Chen before quickly walking to the table.
0:56:14|0:56:36|Inspector Chen slightly pursed his lips, then picked up the paper cup and finished his coffee in one gulp. The next day, on the parking terrace opposite He Wanzhen's house, Lin Xiaoyang carefully observed the building with a telescope. He found that He Wanzhen did indeed, as he had requested, remove the police officers and then smiled knowingly, but soon saw
0:56:36|0:57:2|A woman wearing a beret walked into the building carrying a bag. Through the peephole, Achik quickly opened the door when he saw it was Sally. Unexpectedly, Sally took off her hat, revealing the face of the police officer Yao. He then hurried into the living room, opened his bag, revealing a large amount of cash and listening devices. [He Wanzhen] calmly sat in the car at this moment.
0:57:4|0:57:26|As soon as the words fell, [He Wanzhen] slowly drove into a bend, followed by an inconspicuous sedan behind. However, this had long been noticed by [He Wanzhen], so she suddenly stopped at the three-way intersection, gesturing for the driver in front to go first, then suddenly accelerated, causing the driver behind to be stuck.
0:57:48|0:58:8|During the call, [He Wanzhen] stared at the police monitoring the building opposite [Wang Sen]'s house with wide eyes. Then she crept into the villa's small garden, hunched over, and looked through the landscaped jungle towards the glass house by the pool. Spotting [He Zhi] by the pool, she immediately made a phone call.
0:58:40|0:58:46|At this moment, [He Wanzhen] has already circled to the left side of the garden, with her back facing [He Zhi],
0:59:1|0:59:22|Upon hearing that [He Wanzhen] had already arrived in the living room of [Wang Sen]'s house, [He Zhi] gave some instructions and immediately turned to run downstairs. [He Wanzhen] took this opportunity to tiptoe through the corridor and sneak into the billiard room. [He Zhi], who had already run out to the courtyard, suddenly stopped in his tracks. [He Wanzhen] actually knocked down the bodyguard and covered [Wang Jiaming]'s mouth.
0:59:26|0:59:50|[Wang Jiaming] widened his eyes at this, nodding repeatedly. After [He Wanzhen] released his hand and bit her tiger's mouth fiercely, he quickly ran outside. It was only then that [He Zhi] realized that he had fallen for the trick of luring the tiger out of the mountain. Thinking back to [He Wanzhen] saying she wanted to kidnap [Wang Jiaming], he turned his head, rushed back into the house, and looked at the bodyguard who was lying on the ground in pain with his chin covered. He rushed out again.
0:59:50|1:0:4|Desperate, [Wang Jiaming] ran directly up the signal tower.
1:0:12|1:0:40|[He Wanzhen] loosened her mouth and grabbed [Wang Jiaming]'s collar. Upon hearing [He Zhi]'s voice, [He Wanzhen] instantly released her hands. [Wang Jiaming] had already been pulled into her arms. A gust of wind blew past the signal tower. [He Wanzhen] looked down at the bustling streets below the tower, her shoulders drooping helplessly.
1:0:53|1:1:20|[He Wanzhen] saw [He Zhi] taking the initiative to help her, and she, who had been feeling down, suddenly widened her eyes and stared at the other person intently. Then the three of them returned to the villa. "If you want to complain, I don't mind," [He Wanzhen] said as she stood in the living room and handed the phone to [Wang Sen] across from her. [Wang Sen] gritted his teeth and took it.
1:2:37|1:2:54|[Wang Sen] looked up and saw [Wang Jiaming] who was hiding behind the wall not far away. He lifted [He Wanzhen] first, then walked straight towards her, reaching out his hands and firmly placing them on [He Wanzhen]'s shoulders, and then lifted her up from the ground.
1:4:14|1:4:32|[He Wanzhen] took a piece of paper from the sun visor and handed it over to [He Zhi]. He took the note solemnly, looked down at it, and then squeezed it tightly into his shirt pocket.
1:4:32|1:5:5|At this moment, Achi sat on the sofa with a furrowed brow, took out a stack of cash from the bag, and just as he flipped through it, [He Wanzhen] opened the door and walked in. In a hidden corner, a bug was hidden in the bookshelf, transmitting Achi's words in real time to the outside of the building, into the ears of the police sitting in the truck. Downstairs, [He Zhi] looked up and suddenly noticed a flash of light on the terrace of the opposite parking lot.
1:5:8|1:5:31|We have no one guarding the parking lot across from the eldest sister's house. With that, he quietly stepped onto the ramp to the second floor from the parking lot entrance. Just as he took a few steps on the second floor, the phone in [He Zhi]'s pocket suddenly rang. [Lin Xiaoyang] instantly turned around, lightly stepping back from the terrace to the parking lot, and slowly put the binoculars in the bag slung over his shoulder.
1:5:32|1:5:49|However, while observing the surroundings, she accidentally dropped the cover of the telescope on the ground. As she hurriedly bent down and knelt on the ground to look, she found the cover coincidentally right at the feet of [He Zhi]. She felt that [He Zhi] might also make a similar move.
1:5:49|1:6:12|[Lin Xiaoyang] quickly propped up the ground, crouching behind the tire, then straightened up and walked to his car. He gently inserted the key, opened the door, and carefully closed it. However, this small sound did not escape [He Zhi]'s ears. In an instant, he followed the sound towards the depths of the parking lot, while [Lin Xiaoyang] bent over.
1:6:12|1:6:19|Lying on the steering wheel, not lifting his head, just perking up his ears to listen carefully to the outside movements.
1:6:19|1:6:45|Just as [He Zhi] had crossed a load-bearing pillar and was about to approach the row of parking spaces where [Lin Xiaoyang] was, a sudden sound of intense friction between the wheels and the ground came from behind. Taking advantage of [He Zhi] being distracted, [Lin Xiaoyang] quickly started the engine and slowly backed the car towards the direction of the parking lot terrace, while [He Zhi], who was looking around, also immediately stepped out from the depths.
1:6:45|1:6:52|He Wanzhen came face to face with Lin Xiaoyang, who had just turned the corner towards the exit. He hesitated to draw his gun and then quickly put his hand down.
1:7:1|1:7:22|A van suddenly darted out in front of the two, with [Lin Xiaoyang] smiling and rolling down the window, then taking off the headphones on the other side. [He Zhi] looked at the van not far away and said into the phone,
1:7:27|1:7:50|The van had already turned down the ramp of the second floor, heading towards the exit of the parking lot. [Lin Xiaoyang] listened to [He Zhi]'s instructions beside him, following behind calmly. After entering the bridge, [He Zhi] unconsciously tapped his fingers on the passenger seat, while [Lin Xiaoyang] lowered his voice to imitate.
1:8:37|1:8:46|[He Zhi] listened and then put away his smile, looking at [Lin Xiaoyang] in surprise. When he turned around and saw the van suddenly transform, he could only pick up the phone and make a call.
1:8:50|1:9:15|After finishing explaining to Lin Xiaoyang, he smiled and turned to look at He Zhi, who widened his eyes after hearing just a few words. The car then stopped at a pleasant forest road, which turned out to be the entrance to Wang Sen's villa. He Zhi thanked them and immediately opened the door to get out of the car.
1:9:15|1:9:33|[Lin Xiaoyang] raised the corners of her mouth to bid farewell to [He Zhi], so [He Zhi] could only wave at her and then turned to run towards [Wang Sen]'s house.
1:9:38|1:9:44|Wang Jiaming shouted in his sleep that he was not Wang Jiaming, while he fell into a memory.
1:9:52|1:10:20|Wang Sen witnessed the kidnapping just as He Haoxian's little trick succeeded. He quickly hid in the corner of the restroom, watching Wang Jiaming sweating profusely and avoiding him. Unable to approach him, [Wang Sen] had to call [He Zhi], with the cash already packed in the travel bag.
1:10:34|1:10:52|[Wang Sen] stood in the living room and made various gestures. Seeing this, [He Zhi] quickly walked in and spoke, then turned his head to look straight ahead. [Wang Sen] followed his gaze and then smiled.
1:10:52|1:11:32|It turned out to be Wang Jiaming. In the living room of the cabin, two kidnappers were discussing their plans. The long-haired kidnapper lightly patted the shoulder of the bearded man to signal him to stay calm. Then he pretended to turn around and leave. Haohan was momentarily unaware, rubbing his hands behind his back and squinting one eye. He indeed saw the two people in front of him. Fortunately, the long-haired kidnapper did not notice Haohan's movements, only worrying about the ID.
1:11:32|1:11:50|Tightening the cloth strip hanging by his ear, he took a few steps back, then took out his phone to take a picture of Haohuan on the ground. It was late at night, with every household lit up, a scene of happiness, except for He Wanzhen and Achi who were restless.
1:11:50|1:12:0|At this moment, a sudden vibration interrupted the two of them. Then, a message notification rang on the phone, but [He Wanzhen] didn't rush to check it.
1:12:10|1:12:38|Fat Boy sat in the command vehicle, stopping Inspector Law from further eavesdropping. The two who had just said they would sleep together were no longer in the living room. It turned out they were intentionally putting on a show for Inspector Law to see. After getting rid of the bug, they went to the balcony. Ah Chik watched as Haau Hin, bound on the phone, uncontrollably kicked the wall in anger. The phone vibrated again, and he immediately handed it to [He Wanzhen].
1:12:56|1:13:2|Without giving Ah Chi a chance to curse, she hung up the phone decisively before he could finish venting.
1:13:10|1:13:17|[He Wanzhen] forced a smile, raised the corners of her mouth, and made a punching gesture with both hands, swinging them in the air twice.
1:13:17|1:13:50|At this moment, [He Zhi] ran into the building where [He Wanzhen] lived with a travel bag on his back, then rang the doorbell. Meanwhile, Detective Chen, who was monitoring in the police station, sensed something was wrong and quickly dialed the landline at [He Wanzhen]'s home. At the same time, [He Wanzhen]'s phone rang again. While talking on the phone, [He Zhi] was still outside ringing the doorbell. Inspector Luo furrowed his brow, listening to the voice in his earpiece.
1:13:50|1:14:5|Finally, Inspector Chen lost his patience. Inspector Luo patted Wang Sen on the shoulder, but he just stood up.
1:14:41|1:14:48|[He Zhi] placed the travel bag on the back of the chair and quickly opened it to reveal banknotes.
1:15:1|1:15:7|The people in the police station held their breath and listened intently, but there were no kidnappers. The voice was actually coming from Ah Chi's computer.
1:15:15|1:15:47|[He Wanzhen] joked to ease the tension between the two, the phone rang again, she looked down and walked towards the living room, followed closely by Achi holding a computer. After thanking, [He Wanzhen] hung up the phone expressionlessly, while Fa Zi quickly walked into the police station.
1:16:18|1:16:45|Fa sits in the passenger seat, smiling as he responds to [He Zhi]. Suddenly, [He Zhi] pauses, her hand on the ignition. She recalls the details of her encounter with [Lin Xiaoyang] in the parking lot. The more she thinks, the faster her breathing becomes, like a bloodthirsty shark. After sorting out her thoughts, [He Zhi]...
1:16:45|1:16:56|Hastily driving to the parking lot across from He Wanzhen's house, he first walked to the terrace, took out the cover of the telescope, and simulated Lin Xiaoyang listening to He Wanzhen's movements.
1:16:56|1:17:16|The last bit of recollection recalled the encounter with [Lin Xiaoyang], and she must have seen herself to drive around to the terrace, pretending to have a face-to-face encounter, fearing that the truth was like this. He immediately went to the hospital ward and saw [Wang Sen]'s family by the window, just as [Lin Xiaoyang] pushed the door open.
1:17:22|1:17:35|He then walked towards the end of the bed where Lin Xiaoyang was lying, placing the fruit plate down. Lin Xiaoyang showed no reaction, simply lowering his head to pick up a small knife and start cutting the apple.
1:17:50|1:18:35|[Lin Xiaoyang] slowly raised his head and smiled, saying, upon hearing this, [He Zhi], who had his hands on the end of the bed, slowly straightened up, then awkwardly put his hands in his pockets. He heard the phone ringing, turned and walked to the window. The reflection on the glass showed [Lin Xiaoyang]'s fingertips moving slightly, and her little movements were naturally noticed by [He Zhi]. After hanging up the phone, he walked back to [Lin Xiaoyang]'s side to return to the office to continue working.
1:18:36|1:18:54|After picking out a whole apple from the fruit plate, [He Zhi] smiled and bid farewell to [Lin Xiaoyang]. Then he quickly left the ward, closed the door, and not long after, he clenched the apple, put it in his mouth, and took a fierce bite, as if one more second of delay would unleash a torrent of painful sounds.
1:18:54|1:19:16|Early the next morning, [He Zhi] drove and waited downstairs at the hospital for the appearance of [Lin Xiaoyang], while [He Wanzhen] and Achi had not slept all night, suffering in the living room. At this moment, the clock on the wall pointed to 8:20. A luxury car drove into the neighborhood. Hearing the doorbell ring, Achi got up to open the door, only to find Sally wearing a baseball cap.
1:19:56|1:20:11|Inspector Luo and Fa-zi, who listened to the whole process as bystanders, couldn't help but sigh repeatedly. Then they saw Sally's car quickly leaving the residential area. However, no one expected that the person driving the car was [He Wanzhen] wearing a baseball cap, with Ah Chi lying sideways in the back seat.
1:20:26|1:21:13|Originally, the slap that Inspector Luo and others thought was slapped on Ah Chi's face, while Sally sat quietly in the living room of [He Wanzhen]'s house nervously rubbing her hands. At this moment, [He Wanzhen]'s phone suddenly rang, and she took out a walkie-talkie from it. Ah Chi interrupted [He Wanzhen] expressionlessly and stared firmly ahead. After hanging up the phone, [Lin Xiaoyang] also drove into the alley, passing through one winding and dim alley after another.
1:21:13|1:21:39|She walked straight towards the small house, and this strange and inappropriate behavior had already been noticed by [He Zhi], who was ambushing and tracking her. Therefore, he also kept a distance not too far behind, following [Lin Xiaoyang] to see what was going on. Soon he discovered that in front of a small house filled with potted plants, [Lin Xiaoyang] looked around, found no one, took out a key from the mailbox on the wall, and quickly slipped inside.
1:21:39|1:21:59|[He Zhi] didn't hesitate and quickly walked towards the cabin along the path. Behind him, a person with tattoos on his hands followed closely. Finally, Haohan managed to cut the restraints on his wrists using the nails on the ground. After removing the blindfold, he then proceeded to free his feet from the bindings.
1:21:59|1:22:28|[He Zhi] at this time unknowingly walked into the cabin from somewhere, seeing the wooden beams all around. He leaned over and slowly made his way through the narrow passage in the middle. Little did he know that he had already been spotted by someone behind him. The follower intended to ambush from the narrow passage, but [He Zhi] suddenly sped up and, twisting and turning, arrived in the center of the living room. The follower had no choice but to give up and continued to quietly follow [He Zhi] from behind.
1:22:30|1:22:55|He Zhi quickly crossed the living room and arrived at the end of the cabin, in front of a tightly closed door. The cat demon, who had originally reached the door, instantly sat back against the wall, covered his eyes with a paper ball. At this moment, He Zhi looked through a coin-sized hole on the door and saw the figure of Haoxian. He lowered his head to look at the lock on the door, then looked around for tools.
1:22:55|1:23:19|The stalker, who had been hiding at the end of the living room with a hammer, intended to knock out [He Zhi] after he broke the door lock. Unexpectedly, he was threatened with a gun by him, and the stalker was then handcuffed. He turned out to be the bearded man. Seeing [He Zhi] tying up the bearded man, [Lin Xiaoyang] picked up the phone to inform the police, and had to personally intervene.
1:24:8|1:24:37|After [He Zhi] finished speaking, he quickly pulled out a gun and aimed it at [Lin Xiaoyang]'s head, tears unexpectedly welling up in his eyes. Then he saw [Lin Xiaoyang] trembling, tears streaming down her cheeks, reaching out with weak hands to grab He Zhi's collar, tilting her body and slowly bending down until she couldn't help but lean against He Zhi's chest. Suddenly, He Zhi, who had been tormented all his life, tightly held onto [Lin Xiaoyang]'s hand, then looked at her in disbelief.
1:24:37|1:25:2|Lying heavily on the ground, [Lin Xiaoyang] was also shocked by this sudden accident, and could only kneel down and grab [He Zhi]'s collar. The culprit turned out to be a long-haired bandit, whose roar awakened [Lin Xiaoyang]. She picked up [He Zhi]'s handgun, stood up, and fired a shot at the long-haired bandit. As the smoke cleared, a tear slowly rolled down her cheek.
1:25:10|1:25:17|The trigger was quickly pulled for the second time, and the deafening sound echoed once again above the quiet neighborhood.
1:25:17|1:25:40|At this moment, [Lin Xiaoyang] discovered that the door that was originally being watched by Haoxian was unexpectedly open, with no one inside. Haoxian hurriedly chose one of the small paths outside the cabin and hid in a corner. He quickly took out his phone and called [He Wanzhen], but unfortunately, the call was not answered yet. [Lin Xiaoyang] had already approached quickly and arrived in front of him.
1:25:40|1:25:55|Watching Haohuan calling for help, [Lin Xiaoyang] raised his gun without hesitation and then returned to the cabin. [He Zhi] and the bodies of the two kidnappers were separated by police tape, and one of them picked up a phone and handed it to Inspector Luo.
1:25:57|1:26:8|Inspector Luo quickly handed the phone to Chief Chen after seeing that the owner was [He Zhi]. He realized that [Lin Xiaoyang] was one of the kidnappers, so he discreetly switched to camera mode before hanging up, leaving behind a clue.
1:26:9|1:26:15|Inspector Chen immediately flipped through the address book and then called the first unlisted number.
1:26:40|1:27:20|The explosive news instantly hit [He Wanzhen]'s brain. She then violently turned the steering wheel, quickly moving from the fast lane to under the bridge. Roaring in anger, [He Wanzhen] and Achi stared blankly, trying to digest this bad news. With her hands on the steering wheel, [He Wanzhen] said, then forcefully twisted the steering wheel and slowly knocked her head on it.
1:27:20|1:27:28|Achi couldn't believe it after hearing, but could only unconsciously open his mouth and shake his head gently. At this moment, [He Wanzhen] regained her senses.
1:28:19|1:28:46|Achi kept repeating that Haoxian had nothing to do with it and there was still a chance for things to turn around. Then he reached out and embraced [He Wanzhen]. Suddenly, [He Wanzhen] broke free from his embrace, got off the car, and Achi quickly loosened his seat belt, opened the door and chased after her. Soon, Achi blocked [He Wanzhen] in front of a fence gate, so [He Wanzhen] handcuffed one end to Achi and the other end to the iron fence.
1:28:50|1:28:56|[He Wanzhen] turned a deaf ear, sat back in the car, and without a second thought, stepped on the gas pedal to drive away from the scene.
1:29:14|1:29:31|[Liu Qian] sat in front of the hospital, smiling as he hung up the phone. Meanwhile, [Lin Xiaoyang] arrived at the small stone pavilion in front of the seaside promenade as planned. She watched the tour group in front of her piling up luggage and dancing around excitedly. Feeling annoyed, she glanced at her watch, then took out her phone and put it to her ear.
1:30:18|1:30:33|Without waiting for [Lin Xiaoyang] to finish speaking, [He Wanzhen] directly interrupted her, so [Lin Xiaoyang] had no choice but to compromise and obediently leave the seaside promenade, coming to the back of the restroom, but waiting left and right, still no one appeared.
1:30:33|1:31:7|She had to sit on the bench, tightly gripping the phone with the hand wrapped in bandages. At this moment, a girl holding a Coke can sat next to her. When she saw her mother, she ran towards her, causing the Coke, which was originally unintentional, to suddenly spray out from the bottle. Startled, [Lin Xiaoyang] immediately jumped up, turned around, and pointed a gun at her forehead. But [He Wanzhen] quickly revealed her phone.
1:31:9|1:31:15|On screen, [Lin Xiaoyang] is tied up in the back seat of the car by [He Wanzhen], with his fingers broken.
1:31:37|1:32:7|After [He Wanzhen] finished speaking, she bent down, opened the safety catch with her thumb, [Lin Xiaoyang] took a deep breath, then [He Wanzhen] pointed the gun at the back of [Lin Xiaoyang]'s head. They walked into the parking lot one after the other. At this moment, a car passed by them, so [He Wanzhen] had to temporarily put away the gun and followed [Lin Xiaoyang] into a passage. Soon they encountered a truck head-on. [Lin Xiaoyang] noticed a half bottle of water on the ground and suddenly kicked it towards the wheel.
1:32:7|1:32:22|Taking advantage of the front of the car to block [He Wanzhen], she quickly pushed down the empty bucket on the truck, then walked away briskly. Unable to avoid it, [He Wanzhen] stepped on the bucket and fell to the side. When she looked up again, there was no trace of [Lin Xiaoyang] in front of her.
1:32:22|1:32:29|Lin Xiaoyang quickly found the sedan according to the sign on the wall in the video, and then fiercely hit the trunk.
1:32:34|1:32:52|Suddenly the trunk popped open, but [Lin Xiaoyang] bent down to look inside and found it empty. Then she took a step back, turned around, and saw [He Wanzhen] standing by the aisle, pushing a wheelchair with one hand and holding keys with the other. On the wheelchair, [Liu Qian] looked ahead with a trembling voice.
1:33:2|1:33:9|[He Wanzhen] smiled slightly, then suddenly threw the wheelchair, catching [Liu Qian] off guard, causing him to fall to the ground in pain.
1:33:22|1:33:47|[Lin Xiaoyang] went crazy and rushed towards [He Wanzhen], but unexpectedly, a car suddenly drove out from the passage, bringing disaster from the sky. It was like a puppet being thrown heavily to the ground. Seeing [He Wanzhen] scrambling to his side, [Lin Xiaoyang], with blood all over his face, grinned triumphantly, then strained to open his eyes and looked towards [Liu Qian] who was also lying on the ground.
1:33:47|1:33:51|But in the end, Lin Xiaoyang couldn't hold on any longer and closed his eyes.
1:33:51|1:34:15|Three years later, experiencing the unexpected death of the suspect once again, [He Wanzhen] could no longer control her emotions. Originally supporting her upper body, she knelt on the ground and then collapsed to the side with weak knees. She then looked up at the ceiling and cried out in pain. Suddenly, she forced a smile, as if implying to herself that the reality was not as it seemed.
1:34:15|1:34:19|The large tears exposed the most genuine emotions.
1:34:19|1:34:45|At this moment, a group of police officers arrived at the scene. [Achi] didn't even wait for the car to stop before opening the door and getting out. Seeing the severely injured [Lin Xiaoyang] on the ground, he suddenly stopped and then looked around for an ambulance. [Aiyao] quickly squatted beside [Lin Xiaoyang] to check for signs of breathing, then heard Inspector [Luo]'s orders. Meanwhile, [He Wanzhen], who had left the parking lot at some point, returned to the seaside promenade once again.
1:34:45|1:35:9|Pushing through the bustling crowd, she seemed to have found warmth again. Looking up at the still intense sun, she raised her arm as if it were made of lead, took out her phone from her pocket and made a call. [Ah Chi] quickly answered, and as they spoke, they bypassed the group of dancing aunties.
1:35:17|1:35:44|[Achi] wanted to say something more on the phone, but the call was abruptly cut off. Without hesitation, he clenched his phone and rushed out of the parking lot. At that moment, [He Wanzhen] slowly walked to the bench opposite the tour group, staring blankly at the calm sea ahead. She then turned around and sat helplessly on the chair. Not far away, [Achi] was running frantically along the coastline, as if sensing something in his heart, heading towards [He Wanzhen].
1:35:44|1:35:52|Flying towards the sparkling sea, [He Wanzhen] kept her elbows tightly on her knees, staring at the ground, when suddenly she remembered something?
1:35:52|1:36:21|Quickly took something out of his pocket, it turned out to be the little remote-controlled robot of [Wang Sen], then remembered the bits and pieces with [Wang Sen]. After the argument with [Achi] earlier, [Wang Sen] looked at the scene where the little robot complained to [He Wanzhen], but now only [He Wanzhen] was left standing there sadly, even more shocking
1:36:22|1:36:32|She then took out a gun from her pocket, pressed the muzzle tightly against her neck, had already pulled the safety catch, closed her eyes tightly, and was ready to end it all.
1:36:33|1:36:53|Just placed on the bench, the small remote-controlled robot suddenly popped out and fell to the ground, the sound immediately pulling [He Wanzhen] back from the brink of death. It turned out that [Wang Sen] had triggered the switch of the small robot on the keychain. According to the radiation range of toy electronic components, it must not be too far from [He Wanzhen].
1:36:53|1:37:17|Realizing this, [He Wanzhen] instantly grasped the lifeline and quickly put down the gun. Her eyes were fixed on the crowd dancing in front of her. Suddenly, she noticed a pile of suitcases next to the dancers. She went crazy and rushed towards them, then knelt down on the ground, frantically searching through the various sizes and shapes of the boxes.
1:37:17|1:37:43|On the corridor, the crowd rushed forward to stop her, but seeing [He Wanzhen] throwing caution to the wind, they could only stand silently aside. Finally, after opening four or five boxes in a row, she found him in a giant box, his mouth blocked and hands tied behind his back by [Wang Sen]. Removing all restraints, she embraced him like a precious treasure upon hearing [Wang Sen]'s voice.
1:37:44|1:37:56|At this moment, Achi finally arrived and quickly knelt beside the mother and son. He placed one hand on the back of [Wang Sen]'s head and the other hand on [He Wanzhen]'s shoulder. Everyone was first amazed to see a person suddenly appear in the suitcase.
1:37:57|1:38:24|He Wanzhen then looked at the family of three with a relieved smile. She couldn't help but lift Wang Sen's cheeks, as if confirming something, then firmly pressed him against her shoulder. The family of three hugged tightly together.
