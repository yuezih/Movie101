0:1:14|0:1:23|The story begins with a wooden board full of nails. The female protagonist [Zhang Yu] sits on the sofa, glances at the wooden board on the floor, and then looks up at the man in front of her.
0:2:3|0:2:11|[Zhang Yu] gestured with her hand, and when her ex-husband [Zhu Ziqiang] saw it, he gritted his teeth, closed his eyes, and knelt on the nail board.
0:5:0|0:5:13|[Zhang Yu] hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to respond, facing the vast Seven Mile Sea in front of her, while the opera performance continued on the other side.
0:5:30|0:5:36|The minister of vows handed a pen to the actor playing the emperor in the opera.
0:6:29|0:6:31|Inside the ancient building on the other side is the Wen Chang Palace.
0:6:49|0:7:5|The auntie cleaning inside the Wenchang Palace, after shooing away the children urinating everywhere with a broom, returned to her work area. Shortly after, a middle-aged man carrying luggage walked in from outside.
0:9:42|0:9:56|Call [Big Ears], call [Zhu Ziqiang] over. Seeing [Big Ears] take out a ring, [Zhu Ziqiang] reaches out and twists her ear.
0:11:15|0:11:20|Big Ears, holding something, heard it and turned around to throw the thing in his hand towards Liu Cuixia.
0:11:31|0:11:46|Liu Dapao left without saying a word, which was scorned by Liu Cuixia. She unzipped her suitcase, took a look at what was inside, and then left with the suitcase. Inside the Wenchang Palace, a man wearing sunglasses and a windbreaker happened to overhear their conversation.
0:11:55|0:12:12|He repeated the key words he had just heard, a smile that was hard to fathom appearing on his face. After discussing remarrying with [Zhu Ziqiang] and [Zhang Yu], he returned home and started rummaging through the boxes. He used both hands to lift a wooden box from the depths of the wardrobe.
0:12:52|0:13:3|[Zhu Ziqiang], who didn't steal the secret formula, had to leave home.
0:13:22|0:13:34|The person who talks nonsense turns out to be the man in a windbreaker inside the Wenchang Palace. Acting strangely, he arrived in front of [Zhang Yu]'s ecological park.
0:13:45|0:13:55|Outside the gate, a car suddenly arrived, and the security guard in uniform immediately stood near the gate. When the car stopped in front of him, he opened the rear door.
0:14:10|0:14:23|Hearing a familiar voice, [Zhang Yu] turned around to look at the ragpicker man. The man, seeing [Zhang Yu] turn around, raised his hand and took off the messy wig on his head. On the other side, [Big Ears] caught up with [Zhu Meimei].
0:15:7|0:15:9|Zhu Meimei heard [Big Ears] say this.
0:15:9|0:15:27|Casting a disdainful glance at her, the ragged man had just finished showering in the room, and someone outside the door handed her clothes. Who would have thought that the person delivering the clothes outside the door was [Zhang Yu]. Inside the ecological park, several service staff were carrying food and clear wine.
0:15:27|0:15:32|Zhu Meimei was driving a sightseeing car and happened to see this scene. Zhu Meimei stood in place, deep in thought.
0:16:47|0:16:52|At this moment, Zhong Meimei outside the house happened to see [Zhang Yu] feeding eggs to Chen Xiaobai.
0:18:16|0:18:44|Chen Xiaobai, you are still so spirited, so confident. This is the real you, Chen Xiaobai. [Zhu Meimei] and [Zhu Ziqiang] couldn't help but rush into the room. Let me introduce, this is [Zhu Ziqiang], the crab farming expert at Crab Garden. And this is his sister, named [Zhu Meimei], the receptionist and guide at our Qilihai Ecological Resort.
0:18:45|0:18:48|[Zhang Yu] winked, not wanting [Zhu Ziqiang] to reveal their relationship. Chen Xiaobai sensed the awkward atmosphere and put on his coat. [Zhu Ziqiang] gritted his teeth and pursed his lips, then suddenly noticed the coat on Chen Xiaobai, and let out a cold snort.
0:19:23|0:19:26|Such an awkward situation left [Zhang Yu] at a loss for what to do.
0:19:38|0:19:46|[Zhu Ziqiang] quickly covered up when he saw [Zhang Yu] walking out, leaving Chen Xiaobai and Zhu Meimei in the room.
0:21:28|0:21:31|[Zhang Yu] looked at [Zhu Ziqiang], then suddenly lifted her foot. [Zhu Ziqiang] thought [Zhang Yu] was going to kick him, but it turned out she was just scaring him.
0:23:15|0:23:30|Chen Xiaobai made an impassioned speech, inspiring Zhu Meimei and [Big Ears] behind him to applaud. After a failed attempt at the prison, [Zhu Ziqiang] returned home and hid outside the gate, quietly observing his own courtyard.
0:23:30|0:23:39|In the courtyard, he saw his father Zhu Dapao stepping on a bamboo ladder, carefully placing the wooden box containing the secret recipe for harmony noodles behind the air conditioner unit.
0:23:42|0:23:57|After Father Pig Cannon left, [Zhu Ziqiang] brought a bamboo ladder, looked around cautiously, confirmed it was safe, and then took out the box hidden behind the air conditioner. After shaking it in his hand for a while, he tucked the box under the leaves and quickly left home.
0:23:57|0:24:9|He arrived at the field in the countryside, hiding among the wheat straw piles around. With a hammer and an iron rod, he unlocked the lock on the box, then picked up the box and slowly opened the lid.
0:24:11|0:24:20|The contents inside the box were wrapped in a piece of cloth. After [Zhu Ziqiang] looked around to make sure no one was watching, he lowered his head and opened the cloth.
0:24:36|0:24:54|[Zhu Ziqiang] opens a layer of cloth, inside there is another layer, repeatedly, one piece of cloth wrapping another. [Zhu Ziqiang] painstakingly unwraps layer by layer, feeling more and more uneasy as he goes, but still continues to unwrap downwards. After who knows how many layers have been unwrapped, a piece of paper finally emerges from inside.
0:24:54|0:24:59|[Zhu Ziqiang] excitedly opened the note, inside were four words: "Mess with you, play with you."
0:25:2|0:25:16|Upon seeing these words, the smile on [Zhu Ziqiang]'s face instantly disappeared. He held the note in his hands and stood up with a mix of laughter and tears on his face.
0:26:24|0:26:29|[Big Ears] pours a glass of wine for Chen Xiaobai.
0:26:50|0:27:10|After finishing speaking, Chen Xiaobai and [Big Ears] raised their glasses, clinked them together, and then each drank up their own glass. Inside the tent, they chatted while drinking, with [Big Ears] continuously pouring more wine into Chen Xiaobai's cup. Chen Xiaobai's head gradually became heavy, swaying and supporting his head with one hand, until finally he couldn't hold on any longer and passed out drunk on the dining table.
0:27:21|0:27:26|[Zhang Yu] and [Big Ears] helped Chen Xiaobai back to the room to rest.
0:27:31|0:27:40|She closed her eyes and held her breath, struggling to take off the shoes under [Chen Xiaobai]'s feet. The moment the shoes were removed, [Zhang Yu] couldn't help but cover her nose with her hand.
0:27:44|0:27:56|[Big Ears] then took off the other shoe of [Chen Xiaobai]. After taking it off, [Big Ears] covered his eyes with the back of his hand, while [Chen Xiaobai] lying on the bed was already in a daze.
0:28:35|0:28:45|[Big Ears] gestured wildly, causing [Zhang Yu] to burst out laughing. After [Big Ears] left, [Zhang Yu] sat down on the edge of the step where [Chen Xiaobai] had been sitting.
0:29:6|0:29:8|Upon seeing [Zhu Meimei] suddenly barge in, [Zhang Yu] immediately reminded her to speak softly.
0:30:29|0:30:45|Lying on the bed, [Chen Xiaobai] suddenly sat up, startling [Zhu Meimei] and [Zhang Yu]. After speaking, [Chen Xiaobai] lay back down on the bed and continued to sleep.
0:30:45|0:30:57|[Zhang Yu] tried to pull [Zhu Meimei] out of the room, but [Zhu Meimei] refused to leave and struggled to break free. In the end, she couldn't resist [Zhang Yu]. Pushing and shoving each other, the two of them left [Chen Xiaobai]'s bedroom.
0:30:57|0:31:6|The next morning, as the sun slowly rose, [Zhu Ziqiang] rode his old-fashioned tricycle to the entrance of the ecological park. Just as he got off, he was stopped by the security guard.
0:32:2|0:32:7|Zhu Meimei stopped the sightseeing car and walked towards Chen Xiaobai when she saw that he didn't understand himself.
0:32:46|0:32:53|Hearing what Chen Xiaobai said, [Zhu Meimei]'s face darkened for a moment, but she immediately smiled again.
0:33:14|0:33:17|[Zhu Meimei] nodded in agreement.
0:33:22|0:33:25|With a few words, Chen Xiaobai held [Zhu Meimei]'s hand.
0:33:37|0:33:44|Chen Xiaobai looked affectionately at Zhong Meimei and nodded.
0:33:57|0:34:8|[Zhu Ziqiang] walked into the room, and Liu Cuixia put down the broom in her hand. Liu Cuixia then picked up a cloth and started wiping the table.
0:34:24|0:34:30|[Zhu Ziqiang] walked out of the house and turned to see the clothes he had given to Liu Cuixia last time, a smile appearing on his face again.
0:36:11|0:36:16|Chen Xiaobai reached out his left hand, then quickly reached out his right hand.
0:36:46|0:37:4|After finishing talking with Chen Xiaobai, Zhu Meimei happily walked home, dancing and prancing. Lost in her joy, she accidentally bumped into [Big Ears] who was leading a donkey at the intersection.
0:37:13|0:37:17|At the entrance of the ecological office, Chen Xiaobai and the security guard each hold a blanket and a thermos, placing them on a tricycle.
0:37:45|0:37:57|Chen Xiaobai pushed a tricycle filled with daily necessities towards the market. [Zhang Yu] didn't try to stop him, just watched silently. On the other side, [Zhu Meimei] walked into [Zhu Ziqiang]'s office.
0:40:3|0:40:9|[Zhu Ziqiang] stood with his hands behind his back, looking at his daughter [Zhu Meimei].
0:40:51|0:40:54|[Zhumeimei] who was kicked out of the house could only leave nearby.
0:41:19|0:41:26|Chen Xiaobai took Big Ears' script in one hand and supported his forehead with the other, suddenly thinking of something.
0:41:43|0:41:46|Chen Xiaobai smiled and gestured confidently to indicate that he would win.
0:42:3|0:42:5|Chen Xiaobai excitedly hugged him.
0:43:13|0:43:15|[Zhang Yu] turned his head away, unwilling to continue the conversation with Liu Cuixia.
0:43:59|0:44:16|Next to Qili Sea, Dell is still diligently practicing his travel script. After leaving her mother Liu Cuixia's house, [Zhang Yu] returned home and lay down on the bed in her bedroom. She picked up a book from the bed and flipped through it casually. After reading a few pages, she turned to look at the bedside.
0:44:16|0:44:32|Immediately saw a figure, who did not make any movement, just slightly sat up to check on the person by the bed, then gently put down the book in hand, quickly stood up, grabbed the bamboo pole at the end of the bed, and struck towards the bedside.
0:44:54|0:45:15|Next door, the sound of a pig cannon interrupted the two. [Zhang Yu] reluctantly put away the bamboo pole and placed it back at the end of the bed. Sitting back on the bed, [he] sighed helplessly and then turned to look at [Zhu Ziqiang] standing beside him. [Zhu Ziqiang] looked at [Zhang Yu], a mischievous smile playing on his lips. [Zhang Yu] said to [Zhu Ziqiang], "Your dad is really annoying."
0:45:53|0:46:14|After finishing speaking, [Zhu Ziqiang] straightened his back, twisted left and right a couple of times, [Zhang Yu] watched [him] make a funny move and couldn't help but laugh. [Zhu Ziqiang] then sat down on the edge of the bed, about to take off his shoes.
0:46:22|0:46:34|Upon hearing this, [Zhu Ziqiang] had to stand up again, while [Zhang Yu] secretly applauded. Seeing [Zhang Yu] like this, [Zhu Ziqiang] pointed a finger at [Zhang Yu], who then lowered her head and smiled.
0:47:26|0:47:31|The next morning, [Big Ears] sat in the office with two men.
0:48:8|0:48:18|After seeing off the two men, [Big Ears] walked from the sofa to the desk, then sat on the office chair. [Zhang Yu] followed closely, standing in front of [Big Ears].
0:50:16|0:50:27|Zhu DaPao got up from his office chair while talking, and finally left the office directly. He walked around the alley in the village with his hands behind his back, and ran into Chen Xiaobai.
0:50:53|0:50:57|In the ecological park, [Zhu Meimei] is holding a tour guide flag, leading a few tourists.
0:51:17|0:51:24|[Big Ears] folded up the dog thief and put him in his pocket.
0:51:48|0:52:0|Pulling out a pair of clappers from his pocket again, [Zhu Meimei] crossed her hands in front of her chest, coldly snorting at her exaggerated posture.
0:52:43|0:52:54|The tourists on the sightseeing bus heard this and applauded. Seeing the situation was not good, Zhu Meimei immediately got on the sightseeing bus and drove the tourists away from the scene. At this moment, [Zhang Yu] appeared behind [Big Ears].
0:53:29|0:53:37|[Big Ears] happily walked outside, while on the other side, Chen Xiaobai accompanied Zhu Dapao walking by the Qili River.
0:53:54|0:53:57|Upon hearing Zhu Meimei's voice, Zhu Da Pao turned his head to look at Chen Xiao Bai.
0:55:10|0:55:21|Zhu Meimei brought the tourists to the film and television base.
0:55:35|0:55:52|Zhu DaPao put on the chef's uniform, placed the half-smoked cigarette on the edge of the table, put on the chef's hat, poured flour into a bowl, slowly added water, kneaded the flour into dough, then kneaded it repeatedly until the dough formed and became smooth.
0:55:53|0:56:9|Then he pressed his palms against the dough, slowly applying pressure, and the rough noodles gradually became smooth and round. Zhu Ziqiang then sprinkled a thin layer of flour on the cutting board, repeatedly rolling the dough back and forth until it was rolled into a round and thin pancake.
0:56:9|0:56:22|After rolling out the dough, lift it up and fold it into a long strip like a ladder. With a clanging sound, the dough is transformed into noodles of varying lengths. Grab a handful, shake it open, and toss it into the pot of boiling water.
0:56:23|0:56:46|Several crabs were taken out and split in half one by one, then put into the stone mortar with jujubes and garlic, and pounded repeatedly. Chen Xiaobai and Zhong Weimei watched this scene and smiled at each other. The river crab noodles made by Zhu Ziqiang were still in progress. She threw the pounded crabs into the water to boil into soup, then cut some green onions, coriander, radishes, and other side dishes.
0:56:46|0:56:50|Then add some oil to the wok, pour in the crab roe and stir-fry.
0:56:51|0:57:13|Noodles are about to be cooked. Big Ears takes out a small gourd and sprinkles the powdery substance inside into the pot. After a moment, quickly scoop the noodles into a bowl and pour the crab roe sauce on top. The smoke at the edge of the table has not completely burned out at this moment. Big Ears has just made a bowl of crab roe noodles.
0:57:13|0:57:17|Chen Xiaobai brought over a small bowl of crab roe noodles and leaned in to take a gentle sniff.
0:57:28|0:57:46|He couldn't help but swallow a mouthful of saliva, picked up a noodle with chopsticks and put it into his mouth. After carefully chewing a few bites, he was completely conquered by the taste of the crab roe noodles. Closing his eyes, he felt as if he owned everything. Opening his hands, it was as if he was standing on the shore of Qili Sea.
0:57:46|0:58:5|The sea breeze passed through his fingers, filling his nose with the fragrance of crabs. At this moment, he felt that his persistence all this time was not in vain. He finally tasted the famous crab noodles and also learned the secret recipe of the crab noodles.
0:58:5|0:58:16|In the crab garden on the other side, [Zhu Ziqiang] and [Zhang Yu] were leaning on the table in the courtyard, observing the crabs on the table. Suddenly, [Zhu Ziqiang] spoke up.
1:0:13|1:0:18|[Zhu Ziqiang] reached out a hand to pat [Zhang Yu], but was dodged and rejected by [Zhang Yu].
1:0:43|1:0:46|On the other side, Zhang Yu had a smile on his face.
1:1:0|1:1:19|Upon hearing Zhu Meimei's words, Zhang Yu nodded in agreement. Seeing Zhang Yu touching his pointed head while speaking, Zhu Meimei nodded somewhat reluctantly, but she had already started calculating in her mind.
1:1:21|1:1:35|When the day came, he saw his sister-in-law [Zhang Yu] answering a phone call in a hurry. After she left home, he dragged his brother [Zhu Ziqiang] out of the house as well. Seeing that there was no one at home, dad [Big Ears] also decided to go out for a walk.
1:1:35|1:1:45|After making sure that there was no one at home, [Zhu Meimei] quietly brought [Chen Xiaobai] into the house and locked the door. Once inside, [Chen Xiaobai] asked [Zhu Meimei].
1:1:51|1:1:53|[Zhu Meimei] thought for a moment.
1:1:57|1:2:1|[Zhu Meimei] thought about it again.
1:2:35|1:2:57|Zhu Meimei found it very reasonable and brought [Chen Xiaobai] to the kitchen. After lifting the stove, they saw an iron box inside. [Chen Xiaobai] picked up the iron box and flicked off the dust with his hand. Carefully opening the box, he saw an old piece of paper inside.
1:2:57|1:3:1|The paper faintly reveals some words.
1:3:17|1:3:24|[Chen Xiaobai] excitedly opened the kitchen door and walked out, but unexpectedly bumped into the returning Big Ears as soon as he stepped out of the house.
1:3:34|1:3:53|In the kitchen, Zhu Meimei heard the shouting and stood still. [Chen Xiaobai] disregarded everything, grabbed the iron box containing the secret formula and ran outside. The shouting of Big Ears attracted the attention of the surrounding neighbors and other villagers. The villagers mobilized one after another, some riding electric bikes, some holding brooms.
1:3:53|1:4:2|Adults and children mobilized together, determined to catch [Chen Xiaobai]. Back and forth, [Chen Xiaobai] led the villagers around the village in circles.
1:4:3|1:4:15|Zhang Yu finally ran out of breath and stopped next to the ecological park. After resting for a moment by leaning on a farm tricycle on the side of the road, he worried that the person behind him would catch up, so he quickly ran towards the back of the billboard on the side of the road.
1:4:15|1:4:24|Not long after he hid, a group of villagers caught up from behind, but they didn't notice the billboard and rushed forward towards the main road.
1:4:24|1:4:39|After the villagers left, [Chen Xiaobai] quickly emerged from the billboard. He watched as the villagers walked away, then looked at the agricultural tricycle on the side of the road. After circling the vehicle, he confirmed that it could be started, and then got on.
1:4:39|1:4:56|Just as he started the car, he looked up and unexpectedly encountered the belated arrival of [Big Ears] and [Ma Dongmei]. [Big Ears] was panting as he slowly walked, with [Ma Dongmei] supporting him. At this moment, the villagers also turned back, surrounding him from both sides, leaving [Zhang Yu] with no way to escape.
1:4:56|1:5:11|The issue with the secret formula resolved, [Zhu Da Pao] sat in the office with his eyes closed for relaxation. Sitting in front of him were [Zhang Yu], [Zhu Ziqiang], and [Zhu Meimei]. However, no one spoke a word. [Zhang Yu] couldn't sit still any longer. He cleared his throat lightly and then spoke up.
1:5:20|1:5:24|Big Ears looked at Zhang Yu. Then he looked at [Zhu Ziqiang]. No one admitted it. Big Ears sneered twice. Then he took out the iron box that he had just retrieved from [Chen Xiaobai] and asked the three of them.
1:5:53|1:5:57|After asking, he opened the iron box himself.
1:6:23|1:6:27|Shortly after, Zhang Yu, Zhu Ziqiang, and Big Ears arrived at the inn.
1:6:31|1:6:35|[Chen Xiaobai] looked at the group without saying a word, [Zhu Meimei] appeared very flustered for a moment.
1:7:45|1:7:53|[Chen Xiaobai] was about to stand up, but helplessly sat back down. Upon hearing this, [Zhang Yu] looked towards her father-in-law [Zhu Dapao].
1:8:16|1:8:22|[Zhang Yu] sighed and Big Ears understood the situation at the scene.
1:8:26|1:8:28|Zhu Ziqiang was in a dilemma when he heard this.
1:8:36|1:8:46|Chen Xiaobai's words made the four people present look at each other in astonishment, no one had expected that Chen Xiaobai would really stay.
1:11:2|1:11:11|Pig Cannon opened his mouth, trying to say those three words, but the words never came out when they reached his lips.
1:11:29|1:11:51|On the other side, [Big Ears] finished his business and arrived at [Zhang Yu]'s office, unable to hide the happiness on his face. He took out a folder from his bag. [Zhang Yu] took the folder and looked through its contents.
1:11:53|1:12:4|After seeing what was inside, [Zhang Yu] smiled satisfactorily and gave a thumbs up to [Big Ears]. Meanwhile, by the crab pool, [Zhu Ziqiang] was with a few workers salvaging crabs.
1:12:24|1:12:32|[Zhu Ziqiang] hadn't finished speaking when the call from [Zhang Yu] was already disconnected. Just as he finished speaking, [Zhu Meimei] ran over.
1:13:5|1:13:23|[Zhu Meimei] stood stunned in place upon hearing [Zhu Ziqiang]'s words. Meanwhile, [Zhu Ziqiang] arrived at the Wen Chang Palace, but instead of walking straight in, he stood at the entrance, peeking his head inside and looking around. Just then, [Liu Cuixia] walked out from another door.
1:14:17|1:14:20|[Zhu Ziqiang] stuffs the phone into [Liu Cuixia]'s hand.
1:14:30|1:14:46|[刘翠霞] is seen fondling the new phone, not putting it down, while [Zhu Ziqiang] happily leaves the Wenchang Palace. Not long after, [Zhu Ziqiang] hides in a corner, takes out his own phone from his jacket pocket, accurately dials a phone number, and makes a call.
1:14:48|1:15:2|Inside the Wenchang Palace, [Liu Cuixia]'s new phone rang. Seeing the incoming call, she pressed the answer button and placed the phone receiver next to her ear.
1:15:7|1:15:10|Liu Cuixia's mouth corners lifted up.
1:15:26|1:15:34|Zhu DaPao stuttered as he spoke, taking small steps away from the corner of the wall. Upon hearing this, [Liu Cuixia] quickly leaned against the wall behind her.
1:15:38|1:15:52|[Liu Cuixia] couldn't help but pound her chest with her hands, and later on, she lay on the stretcher of the ambulance. [Zhang Yu], [Zhu Ziqiang], Big Ears, and Chen Xiaobai followed by her side, sending her to the hospital.
1:16:1|1:16:14|While everyone else was away, [Zhu Meimei] rummaged through the house in an attempt to find the recipe for river crab noodles. However, despite turning everything upside down, she couldn't find the recipe.
1:16:14|1:16:27|She sat on the bed looking around, suddenly saw her mother's will on the table, she stood up and walked towards her mother's will. [Zhang Yu] and others hurriedly took [Liu Cuixia] to the emergency room.
1:16:37|1:16:49|[Liu Cuixia] got off the emergency bed and dragged [Zhu Dapao] out. [Liu Xia], [Zhang Yu], and others gathered in place. [Zhu Ziqiang] breathed a sigh of relief.
1:16:52|1:17:0|At home, [Zhu Meimei] picked up her mother's will and read it for a while. Then she quickly turned over the photo frame and successively opened the locks behind the frame.
1:17:2|1:17:20|After removing the back panel of the photo frame, a crumpled letter appeared in front of her. [Zhu Meimei] joyfully opened the envelope and slowly took out what was inside to examine closely. In an instant, the smile on her face disappeared, replaced by a look of disbelief.
1:17:20|1:17:31|After leaving the emergency room of the hospital, [Zhu Ziqiang] silently followed behind [Liu Cuixia]. After walking for a while, [Liu Cuixia] finally couldn't help but speak.
1:18:8|1:18:19|After a few words, [Liu Cuixia] nodded silently. At that moment, [Zhu Meimei] ran over. She glared angrily at [Liu Cuixia].
1:19:0|1:19:2|And him, [Zhu Ziqiang].
1:19:57|1:20:1|[Zhang Yu] suddenly felt dizzy and passed out, causing everyone to rush to help support [Zhang Yu].
1:20:3|1:20:14|Everything in Qilihe remains the same, with [Zhu Ziqiang] leaning back in his office chair, a smile that couldn't be contained on his face.
1:21:29|1:21:41|Chen Xiaobai extended a finger, and [Zhu Ziqiang] stared at his finger in a daze. Seeing this, [Big Ears] quickly walked out of the office. [Zhang Yu] leaned back on the sofa with his eyes closed. Zhu Ziqiang got up abruptly, walked to the other side, and picked up the apple on the office desk.
1:22:2|1:22:4|[Big Ears] hurriedly walked in.
1:23:6|1:23:11|After listening to Big Ears, Zhang Yu and Zhu Ziqiang couldn't help but sigh. At this moment, Zhang Yu couldn't think of a better solution.
1:25:14|1:25:21|Zhu Meimei sat on the stone steps and started to cry. Unable to control herself, she hugged [Big Ears] around the waist, and [Big Ears] happily embraced Zhu Meimei's shoulders.
1:25:53|1:26:1|A few months later, [Zhang Yu] safely gave birth to the child belonging to her and [Zhu Ziqiang], and the family of three embraced each other harmoniously.
1:26:14|1:26:24|After Chen Xiaobai finished speaking, he recalled the scene of him and Zhu Ziqiang buying the secret recipe for harmony noodles in the office.
1:26:30|1:26:34|[Big Ears] listened and then approached Pig Cannon, taking out a coin.
1:26:38|1:26:43|Then he blew on the coin and leaned close to Big Ears' ear.
