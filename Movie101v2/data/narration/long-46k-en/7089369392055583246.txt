0:0:44|0:0:55|The woman sat on a chair in the bank and placed the mynah bird in her arms on the ground. At that moment on the street, a person pulled up the zipper of their leather jacket and fastened their leather gloves.
0:1:6|0:1:25|At the same time, the man in leather jacket on the street put on a helmet and followed the woman out of the bank. He rode an electric bike, holding a ball. A man riding a bicycle happened to see this scene, quickly stopped and said something to the woman before chasing after the man in leather jacket.
0:1:25|0:1:30|Despite the woman holding a dog and waving her hand to signal not to chase, he, a first-rate duck, still caught up with her.
0:1:31|0:1:42|The story begins here, mainly focusing on the struggles and efforts of an 80-year-old father and daughter for their dreams, love, and more.
0:1:42|0:1:52|The protagonist [Wang Xiaopo] is portrayed by Zhu Yuchen, girlfriend [Zhang Li] is played by [Zhang Li], Fan Ming plays the father of Officer [Zhang Li], and Ju Zhaojie plays the editor-in-chief [Zheng Jin].
0:1:54|0:2:8|And the one chasing the man in leather jacket is [Officer Zhang]. The scene shifts to the interrogation room, where the story officially begins. Obviously, the man in leather jacket has been caught and is being questioned while holding a helmet.
0:2:55|0:3:11|[Officer Zhang] picked up the newspaper on the table and unfolded it, while the female officer next to him covered her mouth and nose. [Officer Zhang] leaned over to show the content to the officer next to him, revealing that the newspaper was actually filled with dog poop. The officer next to him was stunned. [Officer Zhang] wrapped up the dog poop.
0:4:10|0:4:13|[Zheng Jin] gestured with a finger and continued speaking.
0:4:59|0:5:11|In the sales office, the female salesperson [Zhang Li] is standing at the door giggling. She hurriedly takes out her phone and runs to the door to answer the call. Her boyfriend [Wang Xiaopo] is talking on the phone while walking towards the car.
0:5:22|0:5:25|Meanwhile, in another car, Wang Xiaopo said to Shen Yun.
0:5:54|0:6:0|Shen Yan's car collided with Wang Xiaopo's car at the intersection, and Wang Xiaopo quickly got out of the car to check.
0:6:10|0:6:12|Xiao Tang finished speaking and turned to leave.
0:6:45|0:6:48|Wang Xiaopo's expression suddenly changed, and Da Xu quickly put on a smile.
0:7:39|0:7:41|The three of them clinked glasses, then [Da Xu] turned his head and said.
0:8:24|0:8:52|Listening to Wuming's words, [Wang Xiaopo] and [Da Xu] were stunned. After the three of them clinked glasses again, the scene shifted to an indoor room filled with models, where people were busy with their work. [Wang Xiaopo] and [Da Xu] sat next to each other, pointing and gesturing at the drawings on the table.
0:9:37|0:9:47|Wu Ming took out a marker and wrote on the paper, Wang Xiaopo lowered his head in surprise. Wu Ming handed over the paper. Da Xu quickly picked it up and looked at it, both of them couldn't help but feel excited.
0:9:51|0:10:10|Wu Mingjiang only cared about the past, took a look and said. The scene shifted to the central area of Nanjing, where a rural woman walked into a high-rise building by the road, looked around, surveyed the large office, and walked in with a contented smile, asking.
0:10:45|0:11:4|Zheng Jin leaned tightly on the table, looking behind the woman to check on the employees. The woman also followed suit. On the other side, at Officer Zhang's home, Zhang Li's mother sat on the sofa reading a magazine, while Zhang Li changed channels with the remote control and talked on the phone with her boyfriend Wang Xiaopo.
0:11:4|0:11:12|Mrs. Zhang turned her head to look at her daughter after hearing this, then lowered her head to glance at the magazine in her hand. What did Zhang Li suddenly think of?
0:11:34|0:11:41|Zhang Li impatiently got up and left, then Officer Zhang opened the door, put the key in the briefcase, and walked towards the sofa.
0:11:44|0:11:51|[Mrs. Zhang] pointed to the room and patted her husband's leg.
0:12:5|0:12:9|Hurry up and get me something to eat, [Mrs. Zhang] stood up.
0:12:15|0:12:24|[Officer Zhang] took a sip of tea, picked up the newspaper on the coffee table, and grabbed a date from a plate. As he flipped through the newspaper, the date fell down. He picked it up and put it back into his mouth.
0:12:30|0:12:37|Officer Zhang spat out the snuff bottle, stuffed the newspaper back onto the coffee table, and quickly picked up the bowl. Mrs. Zhang sat back on the sofa.
0:13:9|0:13:11|Officer Zhang overstepped his bounds and picked up a dish to serve Mrs. Zhang.
0:13:16|0:13:25|The scene shifts to the auto repair shop, where Wang Xiaopo is studying blueprints at a table. Da Xu sets down the iron rod in his hand and walks over to Wang Xiaopo. Wang Xiaopo pulls the tablecloth.
0:13:52|0:13:56|This is a crucial moment on the battlefield, with [Da Xu] rubbing his hands nervously and asking.
0:14:50|0:14:56|[Mrs. Zheng] squatted down and put down the dog, holding the leash. A golden retriever ran over, scaring [Zheng Jin] who quickly ran away.
0:15:48|0:15:51|The ladies sniffed the sesame in their arms and then went to sniff the serious one.
0:16:26|0:16:28|[Wang Xiaopo] grabbed a handful of hair fiercely.
0:16:36|0:16:54|The two of them started to work busily, with [Wang Xiaopo] marking on the board, then picking up the cutting machine, welding, putting on gloves to work. In the repair shop, sparks flew from the welding. In a blink of an eye, he put down the electric drill, selected parts, then put on sunglasses, and started cutting iron saw to make parts for decorating the car.
0:16:55|0:17:5|[Da Xu] is working at the site, putting down one tool and picking up another because of the welding situation of the iron saw. In the abandoned recycling yard, the two of them are busy from early morning till night.
0:17:7|0:17:20|The night falls, the scene shifts to Zhang Li's home. Photos of family members hang on the wall next to Zhang Li's bed, and a string of wind chimes hangs in the middle of the room. Zhang Li is listening to music, swaying her body in front of the mirror on the dressing table.
0:17:20|0:17:33|[Mrs. Zheng] pushed open [Zhang Li]'s door, holding several cards in her hand. She happily approached her daughter, carefully taking off one side of her headphones. Holding up the cards in her hand, [Zhang Li] turned her head and lay down on the bed.
0:17:59|0:18:3|[Zhang Li] was about to leave as soon as she heard it, and [Mrs. Zhang] quickly pulled her back.
0:18:10|0:18:35|[Officer Zhang] turned around. Inside the repair shop, [Wang Xiaopo] was lying on the car roof, holding a flashlight and working busily. He didn't stop talking while working. [Da Xu] climbed onto the car roof, [Wang Xiaopo] took off his gloves and took the phone. He quickly handed the parts to [Da Xu] and answered the phone.
0:18:40|0:18:56|He threw the gloves onto the toolbox. Listening to his girlfriend, his thumb scratched his head. His whole face wrinkled towards the center.
0:19:3|0:19:10|Both of them were attracted by the sound outside the door. [Da Xu] blinked his eyes.
0:19:14|0:19:24|[Wang Xiaopo] recognized the person in the car. He walked up to the passenger side window and bent down.
0:19:57|0:20:10|[Da Xu], although reluctant, still checked the car's condition, while the two girls got out of the car.
0:20:13|0:20:19|It's late at night, Wang Xiaopo and Da Xu walk out of the auto repair shop, watching the two girls drive away.
0:21:25|0:21:46|As he hung up the phone, [Zheng Jin] put away his smile and spoke into the phone. The scene shifted to where Wang Xiaopo was working, the squad leader carrying a tea pot. Wang Xiaopo quickly patted his colleague, sat up straight, and yawned. The squad leader sat down and said.
0:21:47|0:21:51|The company has started, with a meeting of senior leaders above the platoon leader level.
0:22:17|0:22:20|Upon hearing this, [Wang Xiaopo] turned his head and said to the squad leader.
0:22:39|0:23:4|Go, stop talking nonsense, [Wang Xiaopo] got up and left. As night fell, the street lights and car lights all lit up. [Wang Xiaopo] drove, bringing [Zhang Li] to the park on the hill. Looking down through the trees, you could see the entire night view of Nanjing. The car slowly came to a stop, the headlights also turned off, blending in with the night.
0:23:4|0:23:12|[Wang Xiaopo] turns on the car's interior lights and looks out the window. He points outside and says.
0:23:35|0:23:38|His face gradually turned serious, he turned to his girlfriend and asked.
0:23:44|0:24:6|[Zhang Li] looked at him, thought for a moment, and sighed. [Wang Xiaopo] furrowed his brows, and [Zhang Li] thought for a moment before speaking. Upon hearing this, [Zhang Li] no longer looked at him, and [Wang Xiaopo] also gazed out the window.
0:24:8|0:24:18|He reached into his pocket, took out his phone and glanced at it before pressing the answer button. [Zhang Li] patted [Wang Xiaopo].
0:24:26|0:24:30|[Zhang Li] listened eagerly.
0:24:34|0:24:39|Hanging up the phone, [Zhang Li] looked at [Wang Xiaopo], who still had his head down gloomily.
0:24:45|0:24:48|[Wang Xiaopo] finally turned his head and spoke with determination.
0:25:4|0:25:13|[Zhang Li] excitedly questioned [Wang Xiaopo], but he just looked at him calmly without saying a word. Leaning against the car, [Wang Xiaopo] lowered his head and spoke.
0:25:16|0:25:31|[Wang Xiaopo] tapped the car door with his index finger, opened it, put on his sunglasses, and got out of the car. [Zhang Li] watched him, opened her mouth, then turned to look out the car window to see if [Wang Xiaopo] was walking away. She also opened the car door and got out, calling out to [Wang Xiaopo].
0:25:32|0:25:36|[Wang Xiaopo] did not turn around. With the sound of knocking on the door, a beam of light lit up inside the room.
0:25:38|0:25:47|[Mrs. Zhang] opened the door, in the dark corridor, only one woman's face was illuminated. It turned out to be [Zhang Li] looking at her phone.
0:25:51|0:26:0|She walked slowly into her room with heavy steps. [Mrs. Zhang] followed and turned on the light in the room. [Zhang Li] was already lying down.
0:26:10|0:26:15|[Zhang Li] turned over with a stuffed toy in her arms, with [Mrs. Zhang]'s hand resting on her arm.
0:26:21|0:26:23|Mrs. Zhang touched her daughter's back.
0:26:27|0:26:30|She picked up a piece of paper from the table and wiped her daughter's tears.
0:26:37|0:26:56|[Zhang Li] grabbed her. [Zhang Li] flipped over onto her back. [Mrs. Zhang] had a big smile on her face.
0:28:1|0:28:3|[Wang Xiaopo] twisted the parts and asked [Da Xu].
0:28:8|0:28:17|He turned his head in surprise. The veins on Wang Xiaopo's neck also bulged. He turned to Da Xu.
0:28:25|0:28:28|The two turned around to put away the tools and prepare for the test drive.
0:29:3|0:29:11|[Da Xu] struggles to come down from the roof of the car.
0:29:58|0:30:2|In the yard outside the repair shop, [Da Xu] is directing in the front.
0:30:28|0:30:32|Da Xu's big foot came in. Da Xu's big belly was exposed.
0:30:53|0:31:15|The armored vehicle's gun barrel hit a tree. [Da Xu] bumped his head. He quickly climbed out of the car to check the situation. Smoke was rising in front of the armored vehicle. [Wang Xiaopo] wiped his sweat.
0:31:23|0:31:26|[Da Xu] struggled to pull out the cannon barrel.
0:31:43|0:31:58|Unexpectedly, the cannon barrel was suddenly pulled out and thrown away. [Wang Xiaopo] was scared and kept backing away, while [Da Xu] stood on the car roof staring blankly. The next day, they were in the coffee shop.
0:32:22|0:32:35|[Zhang Li] suppressed her smile and looked around awkwardly. Wang Xiaopo, the returnee, smiled warmly, resting his hands on his legs as he gazed at [Zhang Li]. Wang Xiaopo took a deep breath.
0:32:50|0:32:55|[Zhang Li] showed a surprised smile and then looked at the returnee man across from her.
0:33:7|0:33:22|Outside the café, the sun was shining brightly. [Wang Xiaopo] rode his bicycle through the sunlight and the shade of the trees, drawing S shapes on the ground. As he neared his destination, he smoothly slid one foot on the ground, skillfully turned to the side of the road, parked his bike, and then walked towards the café.
0:33:24|0:33:29|He happily took out the ticket from his shirt pocket, took big strides up the steps, and pushed the door open.
0:33:37|0:33:43|[Wang Xiaopo] stood behind the wooden fence, hands inserted, looking at [Zhang Li]. [Wang Xiaopo] glanced towards Officer Zhang.
0:33:58|0:34:5|Wang Xiaopo turned around, then immediately turned back, placed the ticket in front of Zhang Li, and then turned his head to push open the door and leave.
0:35:2|0:35:19|He put down the phone with his right hand, the briefcase with his left hand, and unbuttoned his shirt with his teeth, revealing a scratch on his ankle. He raised his phone to check the wound, then pulled out a piece of paper and winced in pain. The scene shifted to the repair shop, where Wang Xiaopo was shooting hoops at a makeshift basketball hoop.
0:35:19|0:35:27|The armored vehicle stopped by his side, the basketball dropped out of the hoop, but Wang Xiaopo missed the shot and the ball rolled to the side of the armored vehicle.
0:35:28|0:35:46|He bent down to pick it up, but hit his head when he stood up. [Wang Xiaopo] didn't care about the basketball, he straightened up while holding his head and then walked out, and then straightened up. He had just put his hand down, still feeling pain, and touched his head again.
0:36:18|0:36:28|He picked up the pliers and smashed them fiercely towards the front of the armored vehicle, then turned and took two steps, throwing the pliers directly. He then picked up an axe and threw it over.
0:36:31|0:36:47|The glass of the armored vehicle shattered on the ground, [Wang Xiaopo] gave a sigh and turned to leave. The scene shifted to outside, at a city wall opening in Nanjing, [Mrs. Zheng] was walking along the road shouting. Ripples appeared on the surface of Xuanwu Lake, looking across the lake, tall buildings stood in rows on the other side.
0:36:47|0:36:57|[Mrs. Zheng] was desperately searching for her Pekingese dog, walking all the way to the lakeside, holding onto both arms as she descended the steps. She sat down by the lake.
0:37:6|0:37:15|He pounded his legs hard, when suddenly, his phone rang. He reached into his pocket and took out the phone.
0:38:18|0:38:27|The scene cuts back to Wang Xiaopo, who lowers his head and returns to his rented room in silence. Pushing open the door, he finds the walls covered with various blueprints of cars.
0:38:27|0:38:36|[Wang Xiaopo] took off his shirt, without even looking, casually threw it onto the nearby clothes rack, then walked over to the lower bunk of the bunk bed and sat down. As he sat down, he suddenly squinted his eyes tightly.
0:39:42|0:40:0|Ignoring by everyone, [Wang Xiaopo] angrily slammed the door and walked away. Once inside, he took out his phone, glanced at it, pressed a button, then tossed it aside. He pulled out a piece of paper from under the table, tore it open, and stuffed it into his ear. Sitting on the bed, he listened for a moment before turning around to continue sleeping.
0:40:0|0:40:5|Just as he was about to cover himself with the blanket, he hesitated and put it back down, then picked up a corner of the blanket again to listen carefully before finally covering his head.
0:40:7|0:40:23|The scene then shifts to the street, where [Da Xu] is riding his bicycle. Taxis and buses pass by him. He wipes off some sweat while riding, but his feet never slow down. Meanwhile, [Wang Xiaopo] is already fast asleep, with his phone left on the table.
0:40:23|0:40:29|Looking down from the window near the roadside, [Da Xu] angrily stopped his bicycle by the side of the road.
0:40:35|0:40:54|[Da Xu] immediately got off the bike, placed it on the steps, and ran upstairs. The warm face of [Da Xu] climbing the stairs was covered in sweat. [Da Xu] pushed open the glass door, attempting to wake up [Wang Xiaopo] with a stick.
0:41:34|0:41:46|[Da Xu] was hanging on the door, [Wang Xiaopo] came over, hugged his legs and lifted him up, allowing [Da Xu] to free his arm. [Wang Xiaopo] then threw the stick out of the door.
0:42:1|0:42:6|[Da Xu] lifts the blanket, turns his head, and then pulls the blanket back over himself.
0:42:19|0:42:24|[Wang Xiaopo] suddenly sat up, said something, and then lay back down.
0:42:37|0:42:40|After he finished speaking, he threw himself back onto the bed.
0:43:6|0:43:8|[Da Xu] pointed at [Wang Xiaopo] and said,
0:43:21|0:43:36|Pushing [Wang Xiaopo] up from behind, [Wang Xiaopo] kicked the blanket with one foot and finally got both legs to the edge of the bed. [Da Xu] handed him a shirt, [Wang Xiaopo] got up, turned back, pushed aside [Da Xu] with one hand, and walked to the table to grab his phone.
0:43:36|0:43:46|[Da Xu] followed and walked out the door, while tightly touching his wound and making a phone call.
0:43:51|0:43:57|During the conversation, the previous woman suddenly rushed in, knelt on the ground, and Wang Xiaopo quickly half-knelt to help her.
0:44:28|0:44:40|Feng pushed away [Zheng Jin]'s hand. Just as [Zheng Jin] was about to speak, he saw colleagues outside the glass window watching, and quickly waved his hand. The colleagues outside immediately went around the green plants behind and ran away. A male colleague called Xiao Tang over.
0:46:9|0:46:17|[Zheng Jin] walked towards the door and saw [Wang Xiaopo] coming out. His colleagues pretended to be busy, and he approached Xiao Tang.
0:46:18|0:46:24|But then looked at the person next to him, beckoning him to come along. Xiaotang followed, and [Zheng Jin] looked around.
0:47:10|0:47:14|Xiao Tang looked up, avoiding eye contact, then lowered his head to reach into his pocket and pulled out some folded money.
0:48:31|0:48:55|[Zhang Li] hesitated for a moment, her colleague smiled and said. The camera shifted to inside the repair shop, where next to the armored vehicle smashed by [Wang Xiaopo], the scene was a mess. [Da Xu] walked in, seeing the armored vehicle, his steps noticeably slowed down, and his hands dropped.
0:48:57|0:49:8|He walked quickly to the armored vehicle, bending over to look at the front windshield, and on the side of the vehicle, [Wang Xiaopo] also walked over.
0:49:8|0:49:19|[Da Xu] was at a loss, turned around and asked [Wang Xiaopo]. [Wang Xiaopo] raised his hand, pouted and put it down. [Da Xu] looked at him, then looked at the armored vehicle, and then looked back at him.
0:49:22|0:49:43|[Wang Xiaopo] lowered his head as [Da Xu] turned to look at the armored vehicle and rushed towards [Wang Xiaopo], pushing him hard. [Wang Xiaopo] staggered back two steps, then silently walked back in front of [Da Xu]. [Da Xu] pointed at him and spoke.
0:49:43|0:49:48|Da Xu moved his eyes widely, took two steps towards the armored vehicle, and then pointed at Wang Xiaopo.
0:49:55|0:50:14|Da Xu leaned forward and shouted, quickly walked to the armored vehicle, pointing and asking. Da Xu walked up to Wang Xiaopo, raised his hand and slapped the back of his head, then turned back to pick up the hammer in front of the armored vehicle.
0:50:16|0:50:40|After the fight, [Da Xu] walked up to [Wang Xiaopo], handed him the hammer, and gestured towards his own head. [Wang Xiaopo] pulled hard, freeing himself from [Da Xu]'s grip, and took two steps back. Facing him, [Da Xu] pointed towards the armored vehicle. [Wang Xiaopo] lowered his head.
0:50:44|0:50:57|[Da Xu] raised his arm, palm against [Wang Xiaopo]'s neck, and pushed hard. [Wang Xiaopo] staggered forward, adjusted his collar in silence, and walked towards the armored vehicle. [Da Xu] followed closely behind.
0:50:57|0:51:4|[Wang Xiaopo] propped himself up on the armored vehicle with a hammer, arched his back, limbs tightened, and then pushed up to his forehead along his face.
0:51:8|0:51:12|He raised his index finger, gave it a strong shake, covered his face with his hand, and then threw the hammer.
0:51:48|0:51:57|[Da Xu] pushed Wang Xiaopo's face, and Wang Xiaopo couldn't control himself anymore, he hugged Da Xu. Da Xu also hugged him tightly and punched his back with his fist.
0:52:2|0:52:8|[Da Xu] pushed [Wang Xiaopo] and grabbed his shoulder. [Da Xu] gave him a pat. On the other side, outside the KTV.
0:52:28|0:52:31|[Zhang Li] is looking at her phone, while Shen Yan and Reporter Chen wave their hands.
0:52:57|0:53:12|Next, the scene shifts to a small grove, where [Zheng Jin] is holding a pair of binoculars under a tree, but hears a female voice. She is hit by a mineral water bottle.
0:53:19|0:53:30|Zheng Jin stared intently in the direction of the man and woman, while quietly moving to the side. Across the street, Mrs. Zheng, still in her daytime clothes, bent over and walked to a tree under a large billboard.
0:53:30|0:53:45|Upon seeing someone approaching, [Zheng Jin] raised the binoculars, while [Mrs. Zheng] found a piece of bluestone and placed the ransom wrapped in a plastic bag underneath. [Zheng Jin] watched as [Mrs. Zheng] walked away briskly, then lowered the binoculars and gazed in the direction she was heading. In the pile of grass, a man was waiting for her, holding a wrench in his hand.
0:53:46|0:54:1|The man shook his head and waved his hand, while the two squatted down to watch the money being placed. The scene shifted to Wang Xiaopo and Da Xu, who were driving the armored vehicle on the road. Wang Xiaopo was inside the car, leaning forward cautiously while driving, while Da Xu had half of his body outside the car, even though Wang Xiaopo couldn't see him.
0:54:1|0:54:18|But he kept making various hand gestures, [Wang Xiaopo] occasionally looked up to ask, [Da Xu] was very pleased and waved to the cars next to him. In the crowded streets, the armored vehicle was very conspicuous, and other cars kept avoiding it. However, [Wang Xiaopo] couldn't see the road conditions, while [Da Xu] was only focused on having fun.
0:54:18|0:54:30|Wang Xiaopo leaned weakly against the steering wheel. The armored vehicle slowly passed through the tunnel. The cars next to it diverted to the side because of its slow speed. [Da Xu], however, acted like a leader, saluting and clapping his hands.
0:54:30|0:54:46|In the car, [Wang Xiaopo] was sweating profusely, with visible sweat on the steering wheel. Frowning, he looked up at [Da Xu]. [Da Xu] first gestured as if shooting a gun, then saluted. On his side, you could see the safety line pulled up for construction on the street, passing by the entrance of a free trade zone.
0:54:46|0:54:52|Riding his bicycle, Reporter Chen noticed that the armored vehicle and Da Xu had stopped. He turned back while pedaling the bike.
0:55:3|0:55:11|The road maintenance workers working underground were chatting, when suddenly the silent one crashed into two workers along with the car.
0:55:31|0:55:52|[Da Xu] suddenly became anxious and turned back. He climbed out of the car, using both hands to push hard against the back of the car. His upper body leaned forward, but the armored vehicle didn't move. [Da Xu] leaned against the back of the car, panting, only to see the armored vehicle start moving down the slope. [Da Xu] lost his balance, fell to the ground, and quickly got up to chase after the car.
0:55:57|0:56:4|On the other side of the construction site, [Reporter Chen] climbed up the pile of soil, his glasses askew on his nose, digging into the soil.
0:56:23|0:56:26|Officer Zhang, who was passing by, approached. Reporter Chen sat on the ground, looking aggrieved.
0:56:53|0:57:0|Officer Zhang tilted his head and pointed at Reporter Chen's butt to sniff. Reporter Chen immediately stood up to check.
0:57:2|0:57:6|A taxi happened to drive by, and Officer Zhang hailed it.
0:57:7|0:57:25|Two workers walked ahead, slowly approaching the taxi, and both got in after opening the door. Reporter Shen slowly walked up to the car and opened the passenger door. [Officer Zhang] saw the three of them get in the car and pointed ahead to the driver.
0:57:25|0:57:31|The taxi slowly drove away, Officer Zhang watched the car leave, hands behind his back, tilting his head slightly to the side, deep in thought.
0:57:34|0:57:51|He glanced around and immediately ran towards the police car. By this time, the armored vehicle had already entered the viewfinder of the telescope. Amid the loud shouts of the two, the cannon of the armored vehicle pierced into a large billboard.
0:58:50|0:58:59|Da Xu, who was just about to get up, suddenly stopped. Wang Xiaopo, who was still looking at the wheels, slowly emerged from under the car, watching as Da Xu leaned on the ground and moved towards the car.
0:59:9|0:59:15|[Wang Xiaopo] got up, but almost tripped. [Da Xu] was wearing him.
0:59:38|0:59:40|She then nudged her younger brother with her elbow as she spoke.
0:59:50|1:0:2|After speaking, [Mrs. Zheng] stood up, bent over, grabbed her hat, and walked away with small steps. Inside the armored vehicle, sweat beads appeared on [Wang Xiaopo]'s forehead as he tried to start the engine. Failing once, he pursed his lips and tried again, with [Da Xu]'s head poking in.
1:0:4|1:0:6|[Wang Xiaopo] looked up at him.
1:0:11|1:0:22|He wiped the sweat off his arm, [Da Xu] propped himself up inside and left the hole on the roof first. [Wang Xiaopo] wiped the sweat again, got out of the driver's seat, unaware that Officer Zhang across the street was observing the situation with a telescope.
1:0:32|1:0:55|[Wang Xiaopo] glanced around. He propped his hand on his waist and inspected the armored vehicle. [Da Xu] also straightened up, while [Wang Xiaopo] bent down with one hand on his knee, looking towards [Da Xu].
1:0:58|1:1:23|[Da Xu] put [Wang Xiaopo]'s arm over his shoulder and they walked towards the construction site together. Seeing them leave, Officer Zhang put down his binoculars, then immediately picked them up again to continue observing. Before long, [Wang Xiaopo] and [Da Xu] covered the armored vehicle with many branches, both of them spitting out saliva.
1:1:36|1:1:38|[Wang Xiaopo] checks while [Da Xu] runs over.
1:1:42|1:1:44|[Wang Xiaopo] pulled [Da Xu] aside to hide.
1:1:48|1:2:11|[Wang Xiaopo] held a tree branch, trying to hide himself. Seeing this, [Da Xu] quickly grabbed a branch to cover himself as well. A police car driven by [Officer Zhang] passed by on the road, with him looking out from the passenger seat. When the police car left, [Wang Xiaopo] pushed aside the branch and took a step forward.
1:2:11|1:2:13|Da Xu also put down the branches and asked.
1:2:17|1:2:37|[Wang Xiaopo] stood with one hand on his hip, nodding. Both of them turned around, but kept an eye on the direction the police car was leaving. The scene shifted to [Zheng Jin]'s house, where [Mrs. Zheng] was asleep on the sofa, still holding a photo of sesame in her arms, with the phone placed on the armrest.
1:3:5|1:3:10|After hanging up the phone, he picked up the photo and was about to leave. The next day, [Zhang Li] sat with her colleagues.
1:3:27|1:3:37|[Zhang Li] got up from her seat, walked to the front desk, and took out a small model from under the desk. The bottom was a rear end, the top was a camouflage tank, and there were some grass decorations on the side.
1:3:37|1:3:47|Looking at the model, [Zhang Li] recalled the moment when she received this gift, when she and [Wang Xiaopo] were sitting on the bus, [Zhang Li] looked at him.
1:4:29|1:4:43|[Wang Xiaopo] placed two fingers on the tank model. Remembering this, [Zhang Li] touched the model and remained silent. The scene shifted back to the armored vehicle, where [Zheng Jin] was sleeping on the grass, holding a pair of binoculars in one hand.
1:4:43|1:4:57|Upon waking up, he quickly raised the binoculars to observe the situation. Seeing no one around, he stood up and ran in that direction. On the other side of the armored vehicle, Wang Xiaopo was sleeping on a piece of rainproof cloth, one hand on his stomach and the other covering his eyes.
1:4:58|1:5:3|On the street, [Zheng Jin] nervously moves towards this direction, keeping an eye out for any signs of someone appearing.
1:5:6|1:5:21|Approaching quickly, he hurriedly took a few steps and bent down to take a look. Holding a telescope in one hand and reaching out with the other, he moved slowly to the position above [Wang Xiaopo]'s head. However, he stepped on a tree branch, almost falling down, and quickly caught himself with one hand.
1:5:21|1:5:29|Wang Xiaopo woke up and took his foot out. He leaned against the tree trunk, turned sideways, and made a sound with his mouth, observing how deeply Wang Xiaopo was sleeping.
1:5:34|1:5:48|Wang Xiaopo didn't move, with one hand holding onto the tree trunk and the other feeling under the rain cover, not finding anything. He then knelt down, carefully moving his other leg from behind the tree to the front, circling around from the top of Wang Xiaopo's head to his side.
1:5:48|1:5:59|While moving, he accidentally bumped into [Wang Xiaopo]'s leg. He quickly supported himself with one hand and raised the other, about to apologize out of habit. [Wang Xiaopo] shifted his leg position and crossed his arms in front of his chest to shield his eyes.
1:6:0|1:6:11|Officer Zhang sat on the ground with his legs spread out, leaning towards the rain cover. He found it difficult to exert force, so he turned over and knelt down with his buttocks raised.
1:6:11|1:6:22|He felt around under the armored vehicle, lifted one leg to reach out, suddenly straightened up, checked the surroundings, then crawled forward two steps, legs inward, hiding completely under the car.
1:6:24|1:6:33|It turned out that [Mrs. Zheng] rushed over from home. She saw [Wang Xiaopo] sleeping, standing beside her, kicking her with her foot.
1:6:36|1:6:43|[Wang Xiaopo] was awakened and stood up after rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand. [Mrs. Zheng] pointed at herself.
1:6:45|1:6:48|Mrs. Zheng suddenly showed off and grabbed Wang Xiaopo's shirt pattern.
1:7:5|1:7:8|A police car happened to pass by. Officer Zhang got out of the car.
1:8:2|1:8:7|Officer Zhang quickly got into the car, waving to Wang Xiaopo and pointing straight with his index finger. The scene shifted to the TV, where Zhang Li and her colleagues were watching the news together.
1:8:27|1:8:30|On the other side, [Reporter Chen] walked into the office with bandages on his head.
1:10:40|1:10:48|Stop telling me this, Xiaotang is helping [Tan Limei] tidy up, she answered the phone.
1:10:53|1:10:55|She suddenly widened her eyes and stood up.
1:11:58|1:12:3|[Wang Xiaopo] pointed at himself. [Mrs. Zheng] grabbed him again.
1:12:43|1:12:51|With one hand on his hip, anxiously waiting for the call to connect, [Da Xu] stands in the hospital lobby holding his phone.
1:13:0|1:13:11|He hung up the phone and immediately dialed again, looking down at the contact list as he walked out. He slightly stepped aside to let the nurse in, walked to the hospital door, frowned and waited for the other party to answer the phone. He walked down the steps outside the hospital, slowing down his pace.
1:13:35|1:13:39|He listened while rolling his eyes.
1:13:47|1:13:49|[Da Xu] stood still, blinking his eyes incessantly.
1:14:0|1:14:5|[Wang Xiaopo] immediately frowned. [Wang Xiaopo] rubbed his head, wrinkled his face, and sighed heavily.
1:14:33|1:14:36|Mrs. Zheng saw him finish the call and pulled him aside.
1:14:44|1:14:53|The scene cuts to a place under a radio tower, where the apprentice is holding a safety helmet and waiting. Seeing a taxi, he approaches to open the door. [Wang Xiaopo] gets out of the car and walks away.
1:15:1|1:15:7|In a blink of an eye, the two have climbed to the top of the iron tower, with [Wang Xiaopo] handing the insulator to his apprentice.
1:15:14|1:15:24|[Wang Xiaopo] reached for his phone, but accidentally dropped it. The phone broke into three pieces, and both of them looked down. [Wang Xiaopo] shouted angrily.
1:15:32|1:15:39|He turned his head while gripping the iron tower with both hands and delivered a fierce punch. On the other side, Da Xu rode his bicycle back to the repair shop.
1:16:0|1:16:3|Shen Yan stopped Da Xu and asked. Reporter Chen took photos.
1:16:9|1:16:13|Shen Yan nodded. Reporter Chen looked around.
1:16:42|1:16:47|An aunt rushed up, questioned, turned around and left, leaving the bearded old man puzzled as he followed her out.
1:17:14|1:17:30|Uncle Wu pointed at the iron tower in a daze, and Aunt Shunzhi looked over. At this moment, [Da Xu] rode his bicycle back to the side of the armored vehicle, got off and pointed, asking, [Mrs. Zheng] took a step back in panic.
1:18:26|1:18:31|You... you... [Da Xu] touched his nose and looked around.
1:18:44|1:19:2|He took two steps towards the back of the car. As he spoke, he took out his phone, swiped the screen, and started dialing. Mrs. Zheng was still behind, trying to move the branches out of the way. Da Xu put the phone to his ear, but no one answered. Turning around, he said to Mrs. Zheng.
1:19:6|1:19:10|He called [Zhang Li] again, and she answered the phone at the entrance of the sales department.
1:19:59|1:20:17|[Da Xu] frowned as he looked at the screen of his phone, while [Zhang Li] returned to the front desk and closed her flip phone. Leaning one arm on the counter, she turned her gaze to the tank model she had just taken out, reminiscing.
1:20:50|1:21:9|He recalled what [Wang Xiaopo] had said, thought about [Da Xu]'s words, and then opened his phone to make a call. After waiting for a while, he frowned and closed the phone, poking at the tank model with his index finger. The scene shifted back to the armored vehicle, where [Mrs. Zheng] continued to struggle to move the branches.
1:21:9|1:21:11|At this moment, Reporter [Zhang Li] and [Da Xu] walked over.
1:21:17|1:21:25|Both of them looked at the armored vehicle in surprise. [Da Xu] took out a camera from his bag to take a picture, while [Officer Zhang] pulled out his phone and turned to answer a call.
1:21:29|1:21:32|[Da Xu] stopped taking photos and turned to Officer Zhang's side.
1:21:48|1:21:50|Mrs. Zheng squatted on the ground, listening as well.
1:22:57|1:23:11|Someone is waiting for the sun with one hand, someone has their hands on their hips, and others are talking. All eyes are focused on the iron tower. Behind the crowd, the police car has arrived. [Officer Zhang] pushes through the crowd, followed closely by his colleagues.
1:23:14|1:23:23|Three police officers [Zhang and his brother] pushed the crowd backwards. Officer Zhang faced the iron tower, looked up at it, took the megaphone from his colleague's hand, and adjusted it.
1:23:30|1:23:32|The figure on the iron tower began to move.
1:25:23|1:25:35|Officer Zhang's voice grew weaker. Beside the car, Mrs. Zheng finally pulled out the bag from the Zhuang family.
1:25:44|1:25:51|Mrs. Zheng took out money wrapped in paper from her bag, Shen Yan patted Reporter Chen, and Mrs. Zheng took out a stack of money.
1:26:32|1:26:54|In the lean meat department, [Zhang Li] is looking at the report. [Da Xu] answers the phone. With one arm leaning against the car, holding a phone in one hand, he blinks his eyes while listening to [Zhang Li] speak. His body straightens a bit, and his eyes quickly dart around.
1:27:8|1:27:18|Reporter Chen dragged [Zhang Li] over, while she and [Da Xu] ran out with their phones, anxiously setting off to find [Wang Xiaopo]. Beside the tower, the elevator had already gone up.
1:27:20|1:27:29|[Wang Xiaopo] looked at the elevator slowly approaching, with two firefighters wearing helmets on top looking at him. He opened his mouth and turned his head, feeling very helpless.
1:27:52|1:28:1|The helicopter slowly descends, and on the ground, Zhang Li is about to break through the cordon. Da Xu charges directly towards the blind household.
1:28:45|1:29:4|[Da Xu] The fast armored vehicle, with Chen the reporter leaning out of the roof, waving to passersby. Just as the armored vehicle passed the intersection, a young man on a bicycle turned the corner, and a grease powder fell from the scaffolding next to him onto his head, causing him to lose control and cry as he fell onto a table where two elderly people were playing chess.
1:29:6|1:29:25|Aunt Wang Xiaopo from the second floor was driving towards the car outside, but her bright underwear was caught by the armored vehicle. Reporter Zheng Jin was completely unaware, waving his hands on the roof, smiling happily. Children on the street chased after the armored vehicle, while a few stopped to watch a young man fall. Two elderly men playing chess pulled the young man with oil all over his head.
1:29:26|1:29:39|The armored vehicle under the bed has already taken another route. On the wide road by the river, the armored vehicle slowly travels on the non-motorized lane. A police car catches up and turns at the intersection, forcing the armored vehicle to stop.
1:29:39|1:29:45|Reporter Chen made a stop gesture above, and Officer Zhang and Wang Xiaopo got off the car one after another, while Da Xu hurried over.
1:30:17|1:30:30|On the other side, [Zheng Jin] was at home, sitting on the sofa with a frown on his forehead, holding a newspaper and flipping back and forth. At this moment, [Mrs. Zheng] pushed the door open, [Zheng Jin] closed the newspaper and quickly got up, moving from between the two sofas and approaching to ask.
1:30:40|1:30:49|Mrs. Zheng sat wearily on the sofa, while Zheng Jin massaged her shoulders. Zheng Jin bent down and asked.
1:30:53|1:30:58|[Zheng Jin] thought for a moment. [Mrs. Zheng] rolled her eyes.
1:31:2|1:31:15|Money is an unknown thing, as long as our family's Wang Xiaopo comes back safely, stops massaging properly, sits back on the sofa, and Mrs. Zheng looks at him silently. At this time, Officer Zhang has already taken everyone back to the police station.
1:31:19|1:31:21|Daughter [Zhang Li] stood on the far right and spoke.
1:32:0|1:32:3|Reporter Chen nodded as he wrote in his notebook.
1:32:24|1:32:30|Officer Zhang said to his newly arrived colleague that Zhang Li wanted to educate her father, but Officer Zhang had already walked out.
1:32:42|1:33:0|On the other side, [Zheng Jin] in pajamas can be seen squatting beside the street lamp, picking up the plastic bag below, all of which is seen by [Mrs. Zheng]. [Zheng Jin] opens the plastic bag, takes out the money and tucks it into her bosom, all the while keeping an eye out for anyone around her, then she tiptoes back home.
1:33:2|1:33:16|[Mrs. Zheng] was already lying on the bed. [Zheng Jin] carefully approached the bedside and sat down, took off his glasses, and slowly lay down on the bed. She crossed her arms, scratched her eyes, and finally touched the wound on her neck.
1:33:16|1:33:24|Mrs. Zheng then turned her head to look at her, smirked, turned over, and pulled up one side of the blanket to cover her.
1:33:29|1:33:50|The camera pans up to a photo on the wall above the bed. In the photo, Zheng Jin is sitting with a dog-like pose, with both hands placed like paws on his chest, while [Mrs. Zheng] has her hands resting on her shoulders, their heads leaning against each other. The scene cuts back to inside the police station, where a female officer walks in.
1:34:34|1:34:43|After speaking, [Da Xu] shrugged and walked out. Let's go, pulling him out as well.
1:34:48|1:34:58|Entering the scene, the journalists interviewing Reporter Zheng saw Wang Xiaopo running up one after another. Wang Xiaopo lowered his head and said after a moment of thought.
1:35:40|1:36:6|But I think, as long as we have the determination and work hard towards our dreams, they will come true. [Zhang Li] also grabs [Wang Xiaopo]'s hand. My mom always worries that you can't give me a happy and safe home. Indeed, you don't have a big house or a good job. The two embrace tightly, and the people around them applaud.
1:36:24|1:36:36|The scene cuts to a grassy field, with the applause of the crowd, the bride holding her wedding dress train, slowly walking up the steps. [Officer Zhang] is linking arms with his daughter, showing his teeth, smiling happily.
1:36:36|1:36:48|In front of the carpet on the left, the armored vehicle is parked, and the groom Wang Xiaopo is waiting for his bride, quietly adjusting his suit. Officer Zhang hands Zhang Li's hand to Wang Xiaopo, and the two exchange a glance.
1:36:56|1:37:9|Zheng Jin bent down and looked to the side, everyone fell silent for a moment. [Mrs. Zhang] held Officer Zhang's arm and began to speak. A few people laughed and also said a few words. Everyone listened attentively.
1:37:10|1:37:25|Looking at [Wang Xiaopo] again, [Wang Xiaopo] listened to Officer Zhang's words, nodded vigorously, [Zhang Li] then lowered her head with relief. After speaking, Officer Zhang covered his eyes, turned sideways, and everyone applauded. At this moment, [Da Xu] stood up and spoke.
