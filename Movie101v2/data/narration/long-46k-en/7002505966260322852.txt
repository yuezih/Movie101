0:3:10|0:3:23|[Zhang Zaishan] nodded, closed the trunk, and didn't rush to get in the car. Instead, he peeked through the rear window and saw [Hong Jibiao] attaching a small timed bomb to the bottom of the taxi, then closing the trunk and driving away.
0:3:23|0:3:34|Three taxis drove out of the abandoned car park one after another. Seemingly ordinary, they were now all mobile bombs. Only [Zhang Zaishan] returned to the Honda car. At this moment, the police headquarters received a phone call.
0:3:48|0:3:53|Three cars turned into the alley and started changing their license plates.
0:4:10|0:4:18|Officer Yin Xiaofeng hands the note to Governor Jiang. Meanwhile, Zhang Zaishan is putting the bomb-making tools into the car one by one. After closing the car door, he drives to meet the boss.
0:4:18|0:4:28|Before long, the car stopped in the wilderness. Inside the car, [Zhang Zaishan] was bored playing a mobile game. The phone contained a police tracking chip used to track and protect the undercover agent [Zhang Zaishan].
0:4:28|0:4:42|At this moment, an off-road vehicle arrived, and the person getting off the car was none other than the boss [Hong Jipeng], with a head of medium-length curly hair, a round face with prominent cheekbones, and a stubble beard. After getting off the car, he picked up a bottle of wine, tilted his head back to drink, and when he saw [Zhang Zaishan], he handed over the wine jug casually. [Zhang Zaishan] took it and drank it down.
0:4:44|0:5:2|Another henchman poured gasoline on the Honda car, causing an explosion that destroyed all the production evidence. The car sped away, and the henchman driving dismantled the phone into pieces with one hand, just like [Zhang Zaishan]. All the phones were stuffed into a drawer, while on the police side.
0:5:5|0:5:14|Governor Jiang is extremely anxious. At night, a off-road vehicle stops by the roadside. Inside the car, the henchmen, Zhang Zaishan, and Hong Jipeng put on clown masks, and step on the gas pedal.
0:5:15|0:5:31|In the security room's surveillance footage, an off-road vehicle crashed through the iron gate, and the security guard who ran out was shot at by another off-road vehicle from behind. In this way, the two cars violently broke into the underground parking garage of the bank. After a brief brake, another accomplice jumped out and caused chaos in the parking lot.
0:5:33|0:5:37|On the other side, the off-road vehicle crashed into the rolling shutter gate, and the security guard who didn't have time to react was sprayed with submachine gun fire.
0:5:41|0:5:47|Gunfire erupted from the car window, the security guard was powerless to defend himself, and the group quickly stormed up to the second floor.
0:5:48|0:6:4|The security guard blocking the stairs didn't have time to react and was killed on the spot. The robbers on the first floor expressed their arrogance with their guns, and the defenseless security guard died instantly, with his single-shot shotgun completely suppressed. In the corridor, with a quick reload, the robber could expose himself and start shooting wildly.
0:6:4|0:6:8|The fallen security guard shattered the glass. And at this moment, the police station responded immediately.
0:6:21|0:6:44|At the entrance of the bank vault, the robbers are covering the boss. [Hong Jipeng] sticks two bombs on the locks, and several people quickly stand aside, their bodies tightly against the wall. Then, [Hong Jipeng] presses the remote control. The locks are blown off, and [Hong Jipeng] struggles to open the gate, while his henchmen are ready with a cart to transport the cash.
0:6:46|0:6:56|As he spoke, he yanked open the henchman who was preparing to load the money, and quickly, the two of them threw the packaged cash into the car. The accomplices in the parking lot calculated the time, and at this moment in the bank vault, cars were pushing out cash.
0:6:56|0:7:7|The car stopped in front of the emergency slide, and the robbers quickly threw the bundled cash down the slide. At the other end of the slide, the accomplice holding a travel bag was already in position.
0:7:8|0:7:18|[Hong Jipeng] sniffed the cash fiercely, then threw it out forcefully. The robbers who had finished unloading the cash jumped onto the slide and slid down to the first floor, celebrating with screams as they lifted the last travel bag onto the off-road vehicle.
0:7:18|0:7:30|The off-road vehicle sped out, slowing down as it reached the entrance of the parking lot. The back door opened, and the accomplice waiting outside seized the opportunity to jump in. At the same time, police cars arrived at the scene, and the officers got out of the cars, guns drawn and ready for action.
0:7:32|0:7:50|The barrier in the parking lot was raised, and the ruthless robbers directly rammed the police car, using the raised barrier as a stepping stone for the off-road vehicle to easily pass over. The robbers in the car took off their masks one after another, already immersed in excitement, and the arriving police cars launched a encirclement and interception against them.
0:7:50|0:7:59|Suddenly, a prison van rushed in from the side, attempting to stop the robbers. At a critical moment, the robbers violently turned the steering wheel, maneuvered around, and successfully broke through the encirclement.
0:8:2|0:8:12|Governor Jiang received the order and stepped on the gas pedal, rushing from behind to drive side by side with the off-road vehicle. Faced with the collision of the police car, the robbers in the off-road vehicle shouted excitedly, enjoying the thrill of escape.
0:8:15|0:8:28|[Hong Jibiao] excitedly directed the driver to collide, causing the police car to lose control and stop at the side of the road. Another police car took advantage of the situation and got sandwiched between two off-road vehicles, only to be squeezed from both ends and crashed out onto the road.
0:8:36|0:8:54|[Hong Jibiao] took out his phone, and [Zhang Zaishan] finally noticed the taxi outside the window. A number was dialed, and the taxi instantly exploded, overturning the approaching prison van. The blazing prison van lay across the road, blocking the police pursuit.
0:9:4|0:9:20|In this situation, police cars are continuously driving onto the pedestrian crossing. On the narrow pedestrian crossing, the police cars are in hot pursuit, with the chief on board looking anxious. One by one, the police cars drive over the green belt and return to the road. At this moment, the robbers' off-road vehicle turns into an open-air parking lot.
0:9:22|0:9:37|The police chief's orders came over the intercom, and the police cars quickly turned, drifting to a stop. The off-road vehicle, without any pursuers, accelerated through the parking lot. Meanwhile, a small bus suddenly pulled out to block the path of the prison van that had taken a detour. The prison van swerved to avoid it, but the police car behind crashed into it.
0:9:37|0:9:41|In the car, [Hong Jibiao] took out his phone, ready to detonate.
0:9:48|0:9:56|The police car quickly circled around and headed towards the exit of the parking lot. [Hong Jibiao] tried to pick up the phone, but was stopped by [Zhang Zaishan], and finally managed to grab the phone.
0:10:0|0:10:8|Two cars were blown up instantly and crashed onto the prison van. A police car rushed towards the exit of the parking lot, with the off-road vehicle narrowly avoiding it.
0:10:9|0:10:19|[Zhang Zaishan] shot the driver in the arm, causing the police car to ram into it. In the front car, [Hong Jipeng] looked on in despair as his brother's car was trapped, while the police car made him unable to linger.
0:10:50|0:10:55|At that moment, the bandits in the other car had lost their previous arrogance and only wanted to escape smoothly.
0:11:0|0:11:6|Governor Jiang cursed under his breath in the car. The police car and the prisoner transport were hot on his heels, the off-road vehicle smoothly turned into the tunnel, while the prisoner transport was in trouble.
0:11:7|0:11:15|The tunnel's height limit trapped it in place, leaving only the sedan to pursue. [Hong Jipeng] suddenly pressed the remote control.
0:11:16|0:11:34|The bomb stuck to the top of the tunnel exploded, causing the collapse of the tunnel and burying the car under the rubble in an instant. At the same time, a deep trench was also blasted out of the ground. The surrounding police cars could only give up. [Governor Jiang] safely got out of the car, just as he closed the door, he saw an off-road vehicle coming out of the next intersection.
0:11:41|0:11:59|He smashed the car door in anger, squatting on the ground in pain. Despite the heavy losses, he failed to catch the mastermind and couldn't protect his property, leaving him feeling defeated. An officer opened the trunk and shouted. It must be said that these robbers are ruthless, even setting up a timed bomb on their own car. [Zhang Zaishan] walked slowly towards them.
0:11:59|0:12:15|Bundles of detonators, attached with timers and blinking indicator lights, were seen. After the crowd dispersed, [Zhang Zaishan] in heavy protective gear, carrying a toolbox, walked forward step by step. At this moment, he was a lonely warrior, protecting lives with his own life, a bomb disposal expert. The title of the movie then appeared on the screen.
0:12:15|0:12:26|Six months later, on this day, at the Hong Kong Inspectorate Headquarters, police cars slowly drove out, and officers walked towards the building. Inside the building, the explosives handling class is about to begin.
0:14:5|0:14:18|In a nightclub at night, young people sway their bodies, exuding hormones. On stage, the performance begins. At the bar, [Zhang Zaishan] lights the foreign liquor in the glass, tilts his head back and drinks it down. A foreign girl next to him flirts subtly.
0:14:38|0:14:44|Drunk [Jia Wen] gazed at [Zhang Zaishan] with a hazy look of rare admiration in her eyes, then turned and walked onto the stage.
0:14:58|0:15:13|After causing a scene on stage and finishing her antics, [Jia Wen] stumbled to the side of the road and started vomiting. By chance, [Zhang Zaishan] happened to walk by and saw this scene. He hailed a taxi, just as he got in the car and before the driver could start the car, the door on the other side of the back seat opened, and [Jia Wen] got in.
0:15:13|0:15:19|She closed the car door, gazed at [Zhang Zaishan] with a dazed expression, and then collapsed into his arms.
0:15:21|0:15:28|In the lounge, [Jia Wen] lay on the sofa, her knee-length skirt highlighting her elegant temperament, with her long legs particularly eye-catching.
0:15:48|0:15:58|The policewoman placed the file in front of [Officer Zhang], who opened it to check. [Officer Zhang] remembered the address and workplace. That day in the parking lot,
0:15:58|0:16:10|[Zhang Zaishan] opens the trunk, having received an urgent mission. He quickly takes off his coat, slings the equipment from the trunk, adds a small bag, and picks up his leather boots. On the construction site, he measures the size of the bomb.
0:16:43|0:16:54|[Zhang Zaishan]'s fearless look of facing death made his partner [A Bin] admire him on the spot. He picked up his tools and headed towards the most dangerous direction without hesitation. Outside the construction site, police officers blocked reporters and dispersed the crowd.
0:16:54|0:17:6|In a construction site separated by a wall, [Zhang Zaishan] carried a box, wore a helmet, and began his task. He squatted in a deep pit, took off his gloves, and gently scraped this ancient bomb with a small knife. The rust at the forefront quickly fell off cleanly.
0:17:6|0:17:20|Colleagues in the Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit could only watch from a distance through binoculars. One of them was seen holding a utility knife, gently carving a cross along the bomb's head with a steel ruler. Then, he compared the ruler's markings with a drill bit before pulling out a piece of special tape to wrap around the bottom of the drill bit.
0:17:26|0:17:39|Control the length of the drill bit, [Zhang Zaishan] is concentrating on drilling the fuse hole. As the drill bit rotates, the soil under the bomb starts to fall. [Zhang Zaishan] focuses intently and stops the drill. His colleagues in the distance are on edge.
0:17:39|0:17:54|Through the telescope, they stared at Zhang Zaishan who had stopped moving in the deep pit. Zhang Zaishan tentatively pressed the drill bit. As expected, the surrounding soil blocks fell again. He seemed determined to try his luck against the heavens. A Bin tightly held the telescope, sweating for him.
0:17:54|0:18:16|The drill finally stopped, [Zhang Zaishan] took out a cloth and wiped the bullet head. Then, he inserted the prepared hose into the cross, tightly wrapped the metal head at the front end of the hose, and the other end connected to the hose was a hydraulic pot. The viscous liquid in the pot was a solidifying agent, the purpose of which was to transport the solidifying agent into the bullet head through the hose in a flowing manner to solidify the detonator, thus preventing the explosive from being detonated.
0:18:17|0:18:24|[Zhang Zaishan] speaks through the walkie-talkie.
0:18:28|0:18:42|In the distance, [A Bin] entrusts all trust to [Zhang Zaishan], who picks up a wrench and slowly twists the stuck bullet head. The thick bullet head is gradually pulled out as it turns. The wrench turns round and round, as if it's not the bullet head being twisted, but everyone's hearts.
0:18:42|0:18:51|Finally, the threaded part has been turned completely. Next, all that needs to be done is to pull it out to consider it a success. [Zhang Zaishan] moves his hands to relax his muscles and tendons as much as possible.
0:18:51|0:19:7|The ancient bomb, due to its rust and long-term burial, may cause the fuse to no longer be straight. It's not so easy to pull it out. A slight mistake could detonate the bomb, leaving no remains. [Zhang Zaishan] squats down, one hand supporting the front end of the bomb, slowly pulling out the fuse.
0:19:7|0:19:26|The rust and bullet metal rubbed slowly, and finally, the fuse was completely pulled out. [Zhang Zaishan] looked at the uneven and rusty fuse in his hand, breathed a sigh of relief, and smiled freely. The fuse was put into the iron box, which startled [A Bin].
0:20:49|0:20:56|After saying that, she looked at [Zhang Zaishan] apologetically. After a moment of eye contact, [Jia Wen] looked out the window and spoke.
0:21:12|0:21:17|[Zhang Zaishan] vetoed it immediately and looked at [Jia Wen]. [Jia Wen] looked at him with some surprise. [Zhang Zaishan] awkwardly smiled.
0:21:20|0:21:35|The car drove towards the bridge, and the relationship between the two began to change from here. A year later, at the Thai-Myanmar border, several military off-road vehicles drove along the small road, while mercenaries at the checkpoint waited with AK47s. A team approached and started the trade, unloading wooden crates from the vehicles.
0:21:35|0:21:50|The room was filled with explosives. The other party in the deal was [Hong Jipeng], who wore sunglasses. He took out two stacks of US dollars from his travel bag and sniffed them with satisfaction. Back at his residence, he saw the news of his brother's arrest printed on the old newspaper on the wall, serving as a reminder.
0:22:6|0:22:11|After more than a year of accumulation, he began to wage war against the police.
0:22:23|0:22:30|After reaching an agreement, the wealthy businessman waved goodbye as he left on the boat.
0:22:32|0:22:44|Amidst enthusiastic applause, [Zhang Zaishan] strode elegantly onto the stage in a smart uniform. The emcee on stage pinned a medal to his chest. [Zhang Zaishan] turned around and saluted, earning rounds of applause.
0:22:46|0:22:53|He pointed to [Officer Zhou], who gave him a thumbs up, and then pointed to [Governor Jiang]. The governor praised him with gestures.
0:24:11|0:24:18|The awards ceremony ended with applause, and at the subsequent reception, [Zhang Zaishan] stood tall in front of [Jia Wen].
0:25:11|0:25:19|Turning around, [Zhang Zaishan] took [Jia Wen]'s hand and they walked side by side, looking into each other's eyes with smiles. Meanwhile, [Officer Zhou] started the car, but unexpectedly.
0:25:21|0:25:29|[Jia Wen] was frightened and quickly hid in the arms of [Zhang Zaishan]. The explosion happened to be Officer [Zhou]'s car, and other officers rushed to the scene.
0:25:32|0:25:50|The police car of Officer Zhou was engulfed in flames, with Jia Wen clinging to Zhang Zaishan in fear. In the shadows, a camera aimed at the couple and snapped a photo. In the hospital morgue, the doctor opened the metal cabinet, with Zhang Zaishan and Officer Zhou's lover standing beside.
0:25:50|0:26:0|[The doctor] slowly pushed out the body bag and unzipped it. [Zhang Zaishan] looked serious, frowning. When his lover saw [Officer Zhou] in this state, tears burst forth.
0:26:6|0:26:14|In the corridor, Governor Jiang stood by the window as calm as water. When Zhang Zaishan walked out, he handed him a report and said heavily.
0:27:19|0:27:24|In front of the courthouse building, there is a landmark platform with a large cardboard box on it, on which is written, "Caution: Bomb."
0:27:44|0:28:2|The door of the bomb disposal unit's carriage opens, lowering a tracked remote control mechanical arm. [A Bin] remotely controls the mechanical arm to move forward towards the bomb. [Zhang Zaishan] looks around the perimeter of the cordon. Outside the cordon, [Governor Jiang] nervously watches the scene. The mechanical arm slowly climbs the steps.
0:28:2|0:28:18|[Zhang Zaishan] approached [A Bin] to observe the operation. The mechanical arm extended and lifted the lid of the cardboard box. The simple cardboard box was opened, revealing an electric rice cooker inside. Watching the ordinary rice cooker through the surveillance footage, [A Bin] controlled the camera to get a closer look.
0:28:42|0:28:51|[Zhang Zaishan] turned around and looked at the bomb not far away. Soon his colleagues took out the prepared protective gear and first put it on his legs. [Zhang Zaishan] put on the headgear that only exposed his face, and then...
0:28:51|0:28:58|Two officers carried over a heavy coat together, and [Zhang Zaishan] put it on, making him look extremely bulky, like he was wearing a spacesuit.
0:29:2|0:29:9|[Zhang Zaishan] handed the walkie-talkie to [A Bin]. His colleague helped him put on the explosion-proof helmet, while [A Bin] secured the thick neck protection pad for him.
0:29:14|0:29:22|[A Bin] handed the bomb disposal tool to [Zhang Zaishan] and placed it in the small bag on his chest. After completing all this, the two encouraged each other with gestures, [A Bin] patted his shoulder to signal the departure.
0:29:25|0:29:37|[Zhang Zaishan], wearing a heavy protective suit, walked steadily towards the bomb as everyone watched. Outside the cordon, [Governor Jiang] nervously looked at his back, with sunlight streaming through the city's high-rise buildings.
0:29:37|0:29:48|In another building not far away, a telescope is set up by the window, monitoring every move of [Zhang Zaishan]. Yes, the person behind this is [Hong Jipeng], with a fierce look on his face.
0:29:48|0:29:58|And here, [Zhang Zaishan] approaches the rice cooker bomb. He kneels down and reaches out his hands towards the mercury U-tube, which is wrapped with a large piece of chewing gum to cover the tube.
0:30:1|0:30:7|At the same time, once the chewing gum is taken, [Zhang Zaishan]'s gloves will be stuck. In the hotel lobby, [Hong Jipeng] is secretly observing.
0:30:11|0:30:21|[Zhang Zaishan] took off the gloves with gum stuck on them, flexed his fingers, and carefully peeled off another piece of gum. The hand that removed the mask gently pressed on the top of the rice cooker to ensure its stability.
0:30:22|0:30:34|Another piece of gum was torn off, and then he took off his gloves and checked the time, watching the drops of mercury fall one by one in the U-shaped tube.
0:31:0|0:31:5|Someone climbed onto the flower bed across the building. [Governor Jiang] spotted them.
0:31:9|0:31:13|[Zhang Zaishan] had to put down his work as the dropping mercury reminded him of the urgency of time.
0:31:14|0:31:21|[Hong Jipeng] smiled and said. At this moment, he was still monitoring the movements of [Zhang Zaishan].
0:31:32|0:31:56|[A Bin] gestured and said. The caterpillar track is the mechanical arm, which also brought liquid nitrogen at this time. [Zhang Zaishan] gently took it and then turned the valve to aim the nozzle at the U-shaped pipe. Soon, the liquid nitrogen completely froze the U-shaped pipe, and [Zhang Zaishan] took out a folding pliers from the pocket in front of his chest.
0:31:56|0:32:7|After opening it, he took a deep breath and knocked towards the U-shaped tube. The empty glass tube on one side was shattered, while the side with mercury, he chose to clamp it with pliers. In front of the tall building, [Hong Jipeng] spoke.
0:32:9|0:32:17|[Zhang Zaishan] breathed a sigh of relief. [A Bin] also perked up.
0:32:22|0:32:33|Governor Jiang cheers excitedly. In the hotel building, Hong Jipeng packs up his things, slings his bag over his shoulder, and pulls the door open to leave, preparing for the next step of his plan. Zhang Zaishan takes off his protective suit.
0:32:43|0:32:57|The police officer handed over the coffee. At this moment, a remote-controlled small truck drove through the blind alley. [A Bin] and his colleagues stepped forward to inspect. The small package on the truck's cargo box fell off due to the bumps.
0:33:10|0:33:16|At the courthouse entrance, Governor Jiang hurried over. Zhang Zaishan stopped him. As he spoke, he crouched down and took a closer look.
0:33:43|0:33:46|Governor Jiang picked up the bomb and ran to the car. Zhang Zaishan was going to defuse the bomb, while Governor Jiang was in charge of driving. With a reverse gear, the car sped out onto the street.
0:33:46|0:33:58|Following that, the accelerator was pushed to the floor, roaring forward. Disregarding traffic rules on the road, [Governor Jiang] sharply turned the steering wheel, causing the car to drift sideways, sliding into a curve, then turning into another street, starting to drive against the traffic. Holding a bomb, [Zhang Zaishan]
0:34:15|0:34:24|The car rushed out of the tunnel and onto the sidewalk. With a swift drift, [Governor Jiang] grabbed the bomb and dashed out of the car.
0:34:31|0:34:38|[Zhang Zaishan] takes a photo of the bomb.
0:34:42|0:34:53|Governor Jiang threw the bomb with all his might in the final second before the explosion. The blast sent up a huge splash of water, instantly soaking the two of them. They wiped the water off their faces.
0:34:55|0:34:58|[Zhang Zaishan] took out his phone and looked at the photo.
0:35:36|0:35:48|In the early morning, [Zhang Zaishan] lay in bed, holding [Jia Wen] in his arms, gently playing with her hair, staring blankly out the window. [Jia Wen] slowly turned around, looking at this man who walked the line between life and death, she reached out her arms and nestled into his embrace.
0:35:48|0:36:4|During each mission, [Jia Wen] always felt nervous, and the two of them embraced in bed like this. [Zhang Zaishan] rested his face against [Jia Wen]'s forehead, as if pondering something. [Jia Wen] anxiously asked.
0:36:6|0:36:11|[Zhang Zaishan] was absent-mindedly responding. [Jia Wen] gently brushed his face and said. He nodded gently.
0:36:16|0:36:31|[Zhang Zaishan] responded softly, then slowly lowered his head. [Jia Wen] timely pursed her lips and the two embraced and kissed. After a while of tenderness, [Jia Wen] went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. She was wearing pajamas and opened the refrigerator.
0:36:32|0:36:41|Reaching out for a box of eggs, closing the refrigerator door, coming to the microwave, placing the eggs down, and then pulling open the upper cabinet.
0:36:42|0:36:50|Just as he opened the takeout box, [Zhang Zaishan] saw [Zhang Zaishan] approaching. [Zhang Zaishan] shook his head at the words.
0:36:56|0:37:11|[Jia Wen] chuckled lightly. [Zhang Zaishan] opened the stove, lifted the pot to check the fire. Then he picked up the oil bottle, opened the lid and poured it into the hot pot. [Jia Wen] beside him looked at him tenderly. [Zhang Zaishan] then took two eggs and put them in a plate.
0:37:11|0:37:16|[Jia Wen] looked at him and said. [Zhang Zaishan] smiled and gestured with a egg in his hand.
0:37:19|0:37:26|After saying that, both of them laughed. [Zhang Zaishan] shook the oil in the hot pot lightly, while [Jia Wen] took a sip of water and said.
0:38:15|0:38:27|[Jia Wen] looked up at [Zhang Zaishan] deeply and shook her head gently. In the bedroom, two pairs of slippers lay quietly in front of the bed, next to them were the untidy meal trays. [Zhang Zaishan] embraced [Jia Wen] from behind on the bed.
0:38:27|0:38:34|The two of them guarded each other tacitly, showing their affection in the end. Disarming the bomb, such a high-risk job requires a resilient heart.
0:39:7|0:39:12|Two pairs of characters launched attacks. [Huang Tiannuo] suddenly made a move, jumping up to deliver a smashing kill.
0:39:46|0:40:0|At this moment, the traffic is flowing. As one of the busiest car tunnels in Hong Kong and even the world, there is no shortage of traffic even at night. A large truck drives by, suddenly opening its back door and pouring out a box full of ping pong balls.
0:40:8|0:40:27|The floor covered with ping pong balls severely affected the traffic flow. The two-way Red Survey Tunnel has now become one-way, causing a traffic jam on the road. Road management personnel on site are organizing traffic flow, with only the other remaining channel in operation, clearly indicating that someone is deliberately causing this. On the tourist bus, the tour guide informs the passengers.
0:41:8|0:41:21|A tourist bus slowly enters the tunnel. On the other side, at the entrance and exit of the Red Survey Undersea Tunnel on Hong Kong Island, the traffic is much less. At this moment, a box truck drives into the tunnel, and the driver on the walkie-talkie says they have arrived at the location. The person responding to him is [Hong Jipeng].
0:41:30|0:41:44|The truck driver turned around and blocked the road, stopping the passing vehicles. At the other end of the tunnel, another truck did the same. Suddenly, they turned around, causing a chain reaction of car crashes inside the tunnel.
0:41:47|0:41:51|Mercenaries emerged from the truck compartment, frightening the passengers on the bus.
0:42:18|0:42:23|At this moment, the tunnel is in chaos. The tour guide takes the opportunity to get off the bus and check the situation, but unexpectedly.
0:43:9|0:43:18|Mercenaries are controlling the scene. On the other side, the police who received a call from the tunnel center immediately responded. Police cars, motorcycles, and prisoner transport vehicles were dispatched one after another, sirens blaring and alarm lights flashing.
0:43:59|0:44:10|Mercenaries uploaded photos to the computer for the Robin Hood operation. This was a well-organized and disciplined terrorist attack. The mercenaries placed a bomb on the escape door and attached the fuse to the door handle.
0:44:13|0:44:24|The surveillance footage captured this scene. As the mercenaries opened fire, the monitors were destroyed one by one. The people in the tunnel center became even more panicked, and the tunnel was paralyzed.
0:44:49|0:44:56|In the police car battle room, everyone speculates about the attack. Before long, the police cars that arrived at the scene have already formed a line, and Governor Jiang gets out of the car.
0:45:6|0:45:16|Governor Jiang decisively gave orders to the person in charge of the tunnel center. At this moment, the vehicle from the bomb disposal unit slowly came to a stop. Zhang Zaishan got out of the car and spoke to the soldiers behind him.
0:45:18|0:45:28|He turned and ran towards the center of the tunnel. At this moment, there were no vehicles passing through the tunnel entrance, instead, there were police cars and police officers armed with live ammunition.
0:45:29|0:45:37|Media reporters were also on site prepared for live broadcast. In the tunnel, mercenaries hid behind the car doors with guns, and both sides were facing off.
0:45:48|0:45:55|In front of the monitoring screen at the orbit center, everyone stared intently. Said [Zhang Zaishan].
0:45:58|0:46:4|The scene slowly advances, [Zhang Zaishan] recognizes [Huo Bao], who is [Hong Jipeng]. He is holding a gun.
0:46:6|0:46:12|After speaking, [Zhang Zaishan] glanced at [Governor Jiang]. [Governor Jiang] also bent down and carefully confirmed it.
0:46:53|0:47:15|At the scene in the tunnel, maintenance workers wearing helmets and vests run towards the police car. Gunfire erupts, mercenaries hit two people, and the police immediately return fire. Journalists and media personnel panic and flee. Inside the tunnel, the mercenaries shout at the hostages.
0:47:20|0:47:36|At the entrance of the tunnel, both sides were hiding behind cars and engaging in continuous gunfire. On the car, sparks flew as bullets grazed, and in the blink of an eye, the car serving as cover was riddled with bullet holes. Just then, Governor Jiang rushed to the front car, where the mercenaries were well-prepared and their firepower was no less than that of the fully equipped police officers.
0:47:36|0:47:42|Governor Jiang took the opportunity to slip into the car, and then started the sedan, driving through the roadblock towards the tunnel.
0:47:45|0:48:0|The director of the action department in the rear gives orders. In the car, [Governor Jiang] drives with one hand on the steering wheel and the other hand shooting continuously. This suicidal behavior quickly shatters the car windows. [Governor Jiang] jumps out of the car and hides in a medium-sized sedan, then starts the car again and rushes towards the injured maintenance worker.
0:48:0|0:48:11|Previously, the car that crashed into the tunnel entrance briefly attracted gunfire, and [Governor Jiang], seizing the opportunity, has already arrived next to the maintenance personnel. With more mercenaries on hand and firepower suppressing, [Governor Jiang] simply couldn't get out of the car to rescue people.
0:48:12|0:48:15|[A Bin] is now driving the car, preparing to rescue [Governor Jiang].
0:48:26|0:48:33|[A Bin] quickly started the car and [Huo Bao] threw a grenade. The previous car was instantly destroyed by the explosion.
0:48:35|0:48:41|The raging fire engulfed the car with only the iron frame left. [Huo Bao] dialed the public phone in the tunnel.
0:49:6|0:49:17|[Jia Wen] saw the TV report and sent a text message to [Zhang Zaishan].
0:49:27|0:49:39|She remembered the story of a superhero, then picked up her phone to continue editing. As [Zhang Zaishan], who was about to go out for negotiations, heard the phone ring, he took it out and saw that it was a message from [Jia Wen], saying four words: "I trust you can."
0:49:39|0:49:55|[Zhang Zaishan] put away his phone, opened the door and walked out quickly. [Governor Jiang] patted him on the back, signaling him to be safe. [Zhang Zaishan] walked towards the tunnel empty-handed, not even wearing a bulletproof vest. The short distance of less than a hundred meters seemed unusually long due to the confrontation between the two sides.
0:49:55|0:50:13|In the concerned gaze of the police officers, he remained resolute and stepped into the most dangerous place. The mercenaries on the steps were particularly vigilant as the bomb disposal expert approached, with the gun pointed at him all the time. [Zhang Zaishan] looked around but unexpectedly was ambushed from behind by the mercenaries, who pushed him hard.
0:50:16|0:50:23|Next, being firmly pressed to the ground, another mercenary stepped forward to search him, and [Huo Bao] was not in a good mood.
0:50:23|0:50:35|He kicked Zhang Zaishan hard on the head, then squatted down in front of him, pinching his chin to lift it up. The kick just now made Zhang Zaishan's brow bleed profusely, and he was slowly dragged up.
0:51:8|0:51:26|On the bus, Director Chen was dragged off and the mercenaries took him to [Huo Bao]. As they spoke, [Huo Bao] pulled out a gun and handed it to [Zhang Zaishan]. After taking the gun, [Huo Bao] glanced at Director Chen.
0:51:39|0:51:44|[Huo Bao] sprayed the car with bullets, frightening the hostages inside.
0:52:45|0:52:58|Upon hearing this, [Zhang Zaishan] closed his eyes in agony. The hostages who had just been shot were vivid in his mind. [Huo Bao] was unreasonable, and there was no other way but to compromise.
0:53:1|0:53:11|Huo Bao lowered his head in thought for a moment, patting Zhang Zaishan on the shoulder.
0:53:23|0:53:29|[Huo Bao] gritted his teeth and spoke. [Zhang Zaishan] listened with a vacant look in his eyes.
0:53:30|0:53:36|[Huo Bao] pushed [Zhang Zaishan] aside, glaring at him fiercely until he turned and walked towards the tunnel exit.
0:53:49|0:53:54|After cleaning up the wound, [Zhang Zaishan] returned to the command center and interrupted the engineer.
0:55:0|0:55:7|The brightly lit harbor, with fishing boats still sailing, a helicopter flew across the night sky towards the helipad on a distant high-rise building.
0:55:36|0:55:46|The prison guard handed the file to [Governor Jiang], while [Zhang Zaishan] listened on the side. [Hong Jibiao] was brought in with handcuffs and leg irons, his gaze fixed on [Zhang Zaishan] who was surprisingly gentle as he escorted him into the prison.
0:55:47|0:55:59|[Zhang Zaishan] gave a glance. The two officers escorted him into the car without delay, heading straight for the Red Tunnel. The atmosphere inside the car was quite heavy. [Zhang Zaishan] turned around and spoke. Upon hearing this, [Hong Jibiao] was stunned on the spot.
0:56:9|0:56:14|[Hong Jibiao] suddenly struggled, and the prison guard immediately pressed him down. [Zhang Zaishan] and [Governor Jiang] turned around to stare at him.
0:56:58|0:57:6|The large truck rushing out at the intersection overturned the prison van on the spot.
0:57:14|0:57:20|Sitting by the phone in the tunnel, [Hong Jipeng] calmly picked up the receiver, lazily saying.
0:57:26|0:57:40|[Yin Xiaofeng] helplessly hung up the phone, noticing that it was already 11:51 PM, leaving little time for the police. The phone in the tunnel rang again, and [Huo Bao] calmly answered the call.
0:57:53|0:57:57|Impatient [Huo Bao] is smashing the phone booth with a receiver, while over here.
0:58:4|0:58:9|Yin Xiaofeng hurriedly ran to the monitoring station.
0:58:19|0:58:31|In the tunnel, [Huo Bao] raised his AK and aimed at him. At exactly 12 o'clock, a gunshot rang out, and the hostage fell to the ground. The phone in the command center rang, and [Yin Xiaofeng] answered. [Huo Bao] hung up the phone.
0:58:33|0:58:39|On the tour bus, everyone was shocked to see this scene. Zhang Zaishan's phone rang, and the caller was Yin Xiaofeng.
0:58:42|0:58:49|[Zhang Zaishan] looked up and saw [Hong Jibiao] in the ambulance wearing an oxygen mask. Poor [Hong Jibiao] was seriously injured and was strapped to a stretcher.
0:59:2|0:59:11|After finishing the call, [Huo Bao] immediately hung up. He walked onto the bus, selecting his next target, walking slowly down the aisle, with each step causing fear and trepidation among the passengers.
0:59:11|0:59:23|He stopped in front of a young woman, who looked at him timidly. [Huo Bao] raised his submachine gun and aimed it at the woman's face, checking the time on his watch.
0:59:23|0:59:43|Time passes second by second, and the woman is getting closer to death. In the command center, everyone watches the electronic clock, hoping to save one more life. With only a few seconds left, [Huo Bao]'s index finger is already on the trigger.
0:59:52|1:0:3|The woman looked at [Huo Bao] without daring to relax, while [Huo Bao] smirked and slowly smiled. He moved the gun away, got out of the car, and only then did the woman breathe a sigh of relief. In front of the police car, [Zhang Zaishan] picked up the megaphone.
1:0:20|1:0:32|The tour guide raised his hands and shouted as he approached, seemingly holding something in his hands, making [Zhang Zaishan] nervous. When the tour guide walked in, [Zhang Zaishan] signaled for him to stop. The tour guide, somewhat flustered, handed over the phone in his hand. After a brief inspection.
1:0:38|1:0:45|The tour guide walked towards the ambulance with a phone in hand, followed by [Zhang Zaishan] and [Governor Jiang]. The tour guide approached the stretcher tremblingly, slowly crouching down.
1:0:45|1:1:0|Lifted up the phone to record. With only his eyes bandaged, [Hong Jibiao] looked puzzled at the tour guide, while on the other end of the video, [Huo Bao] recognized him as his brother. After confirming, the tour guide walked down from the ambulance, and [Huo Bao] felt relieved upon seeing his brother. [Zhang Zaishan] shouted to [Huo Bao] through the video.
1:1:50|1:2:0|[Zhang Zaishan] heard this and shoved the megaphone into the car. Immediately after, medical personnel slowly pushed [Hong Jibiao]'s stretcher out of the car, with [Zhang Zaishan] pushing the stretcher alone, walking towards the inside.
1:2:3|1:2:11|[Huo Bao] gave the order, and the guys rushed to help carry the stretcher. The cars blocking the road hindered the stretcher's progress, so they had to choose to carry it through the steps on the side of the tunnel.
1:2:26|1:2:35|When the younger brother returned, [Huo Bao]'s temper softened a lot. He immediately ordered his men to release the hostages, then walked over to [Zhang Zaishan] and handed him a phone.
1:2:38|1:2:42|[Zhang Zaishan] took the phone when he heard the words, glanced at [Hong Jibiao], and turned away.
1:3:10|1:3:19|[Huang Tiannuo] looked determined, and his father beside him pulled him back. He gently patted his father's hand, got out of the car, only to drop his work ID on the ground.
1:3:20|1:3:31|The mercenary hesitated for a moment, closed the car door and bent down to pick up something, causing the father and uncles inside the car to become extremely nervous. The mercenary slammed the documents onto [Huang Tiannuo]'s face, carefully comparing the photo on the documents before raising his gun.
1:3:51|1:4:4|The escaped hostages, arranged by the police, boarded the prepared bus one by one. An officer at the bus door counted the numbers, while [Zhang Zaishan] sat exhausted and in pain on the roadside steps.
1:4:16|1:4:45|[Huang Tiannuo] walked towards with a bomb strapped to him. [Zhang Zaishan] quickly got up and rushed over. The people in the command center frowned as they watched the surveillance footage. [Huang Tiannuo] raised his hands nervously, [Zhang Zaishan] walked towards him quickly and introduced himself. He gestured for [Huang Tiannuo] to raise his hands, and he complied.
1:4:56|1:5:1|[Zhang Zaishan] bent over and circled around behind [Huang Tiannuo], checked the route, and then circled back to the front.
1:5:8|1:5:14|The inquiring officer immediately responded, carrying the box and heading towards [Zhang Zaishan].
1:5:33|1:5:50|[Zhang Zaishan] turned on the flashlight, getting closer to observe carefully. He reached out to fiddle with the complex wiring around [Huang Tiannuo]'s waist, making [Huang Tiannuo] extremely nervous, taking a deep breath and looking up. [Zhang Zaishan] squatted down, circling around him to find the wiring, and he said with his head held high.
1:5:52|1:6:8|[Huang Tiannuo]'s lips trembled, trying to maintain a calm facade. Just as he was about to cut the wire, [Huang Tiannuo] grabbed [Zhang Zaishan]'s hand. [Zhang Zaishan] patted his hand, signaling him to calm down. Huang Tiannuo slowly let go of his hand, raised it again, and only then did [Zhang Zaishan] feel reassured to continue working.
1:6:8|1:6:17|He quickly cut the two wires cleanly without any explosion, giving Huang Tiannuo some confidence. [Zhang Zaishan] did not dare to slack off at all, and quickly circled around to his side.
1:6:25|1:6:35|The father in the car anxiously waited by the window. [Huo Bao], hiding in the shadows, secretly pressed the remote control.
1:7:22|1:7:41|[Zhang Zaishan] was struck by these words and stopped what he was doing. The one-minute countdown had begun. [Zhang Zaishan] calmly watched the countdown, slowly stood up, locked eyes with the other person, and grabbed his wrist.
1:8:43|1:8:51|The explosion's shockwave instantly shattered the car windows and sent [Zhang Zaishan] flying, he was harshly thrown onto the windshield and then back to the ground.
1:8:52|1:9:15|The car closer to the explosion was also overturned. Inside the tunnel at that moment, Huang Tiannuo's father and uncles stared in shock for a long time. The father in the passenger seat started crying first, everything happened too quickly. In the command center, the female police officer covered her mouth and cried in pain.
1:9:15|1:9:35|Governor Jiang, who was at the scene, squatted down uncomfortably, while the officers on the second floor helplessly tapped on the railing. The media reporters, who usually enjoyed watching the excitement, were now shedding tears, moving everyone present at that moment. The old father leaned against the car window, touching the watch his son had just given him, heartbroken and tearful.
1:9:35|1:9:43|[Zhang Zaishan] sat on the ground with a dirty face, leaning against the wheels of the bus, when his phone rang.
1:9:50|1:10:4|After speaking, [Hong Jipeng] in the tunnel hung up the phone. He had been planning for so long, and finally let out a sigh of relief today. On the other end of the phone, [Zhang Zaishan] in the tunnel stared intently.
1:10:4|1:10:18|The pain climbed all over his face at this moment, he frowned tightly, stared, and watched the young life pass away in front of him, causing his facial expression to distort as if being suffocated, even though he was sitting, there was a feeling of breathlessness at this moment.
1:10:18|1:10:38|His chest heaved violently, unwilling yet helpless, [Huang Tiannuo]'s police badge still intact. In the photo, the young man smiled brightly, the tunnel crisis coming to an end. In front of the command center desk, [Zhang Zaishan] rubbed his wounds with a disinfectant wipe, while [Governor Jiang] leaned on the table with one hand.
1:10:48|1:11:12|The almost physical confrontation between Governor Jiang and Zhang Zaishan was narrowly averted. Governor Jiang stormed out of the room. In a state of near collapse, he stood outside the door, howling in agony, while A Bin at the command center had lips turning white and trembling slightly.
1:11:13|1:11:22|[Zhang Zaishan] pushed the door open and entered the safe passage. He held onto the handrail and walked down slowly, arriving next to [Governor Jiang]. [Governor Jiang] glanced back at him and said.
1:11:23|1:11:32|Tears welled up in his eyes as he spoke, and [Zhang Zaishan] sat down slowly beside him to offer comfort.
1:11:46|1:12:1|A bomb attack has become a nightmare for Governor Jiang. He covered his face and started crying, worried about losing control of his emotions, then quickly wiped away the tears. Taking a deep breath to compose himself, he turned his head and said, with Zhang Zaishan staring at him in silence.
1:12:4|1:12:20|Governor Jiang urged him unwillingly, while Zhang Zaishan simply turned his head away, wiped away a tear, and then reached out to pat Governor Jiang on the shoulder. The two brothers didn't say a word, just encouraging each other with pats as the bus drove back home.
1:12:29|1:12:38|Another passenger grabbed the police officer from behind, and a wire cut into the officer's neck, drawing blood.
1:13:59|1:14:8|Armed helicopters slowly ascended into the air and flew towards the tunnel. At dawn, the ferry boats on the sea began to operate, while the tunnel remained in chaos.
1:14:8|1:14:19|On top of the carriage, there are two mercenaries lying in wait, facing off against hundreds of fully armed police officers. On the police side, after nearly a night of fighting, they have started to arrange shifts and rest for the personnel.
1:14:27|1:14:34|The gangsters threw food into the car window, and [Huang Tiannuo]'s father was just about to have an outburst but was stopped. The Red Tunnel hostage incident has been going on for over 10 hours with no signs of resolution yet.
1:15:30|1:15:36|Mr. Yan and [Governor Jiang] engage in a confrontation.
1:16:30|1:16:44|In the tunnel, [Huo Bao] finished watching the news and felt great, handing a bottle of mineral water to the child in the car. The mother nervously took the mineral water from the child's hand. Soon, [Huo Bao] arrived at [Huang Tiannuo]'s father's car.
1:16:44|1:16:51|He reached out and touched the watch on his father's wrist, glanced at the old man, and then spoke. The old man stared and explained.
1:17:2|1:17:16|The old man could only hand over the birthday gift from his son to the enemy with the grief of losing his son. After receiving the watch, [Huo Bao] smiled and turned around, leaving the old man looking at his back unwillingly.
1:17:44|1:17:50|[Hong Jibiao] closed his eyes and pleaded.
1:19:21|1:19:28|He answered the call from [Huo Bao].
1:19:40|1:19:53|It quickly became night time, and at the entrance of the tunnel were armed police officers, all wearing bulletproof helmets and vests. At the front of the formation were officers holding riot shields. [Huo Bao] definitely couldn't break through by force.
1:20:7|1:20:23|[Zhang Zaishan] leaned against the guardrail on the side of the road. The call to [Jia Wen] didn't go through, but he didn't think much of it. Just as he stood up, the phone rang again, but this time it was [Hong Jipeng]'s phone. [Zhang Zaishan] picked up the phone to check the number.
1:20:23|1:20:29|After hesitating for a moment, [Zhang Zaishan] answered the phone. However, there was a long delay before a voice came through on the other end.
1:21:18|1:21:40|The phone call ended, [Zhang Zaishan] put down his phone and pondered. The clue might be the license plate number from back then. He began to recall the scene of planting the bomb together, at that abandoned car recycling station, where he personally opened the trunk. Frowning, with his eyes closed, [Zhang Zaishan] tried hard to remember.
1:21:45|1:21:52|The police quickly launched a search, with an officer riding a motorcycle arriving at a gas station.
1:22:5|1:22:22|[Zhang Zaishan] got out of the car and strode towards the taxi. He first bent down to look through the window, inspected the interior, found nothing unusual, then went to the trunk. He leaned over, pressed his ear against the trunk to make sure there was no ticking bomb, and then pried it open. Inside the car was [Jia Wen], who was bound.
1:22:47|1:22:59|Jia Wen, who was crying anxiously, shook her head in fear. Zhang Zaishan urged, and Jia Wen nodded with tears in her eyes. Seeing this, Zhang Zaishan picked up the pliers in his hand and slowly inserted them near the lock, then cut it with force.
1:22:59|1:23:10|The lock strap broke, but [Jia Wen] in the trunk was terrified. Then he cut the lock strap at her ankle, lifted [Jia Wen] up, and held her hand, saying.
1:23:16|1:23:30|After letting go of [Jia Wen]'s hand, [Jia Wen] started trembling because she had exerted too much force. She switched to holding the grenade with one hand. At the same time, she tightly wrapped the grenade and her hand together with tape, then said.
1:23:34|1:23:45|[Jia Wen] nodded tearfully. Outside the gas station at this moment, workers were pushing carts to bring sandbags. With the joint efforts of five or six workers, the sandbags were arranged in a circle and continuously stacked higher. The bomb disposal team's vehicle was also in position.
1:23:56|1:24:3|Jia Wen, whose emotions gradually calmed down, shook her head as she looked at Zhang Zaishan.
1:24:5|1:24:18|[Zhang Zaishan] walked towards the sandbag formation holding [Jia Wen]'s hand, just like the story he told at that time, the story about the girl's hand and the hand grenade. [Zhang Zaishan] looked at [Jia Wen] with a determined gaze as tears welled up in her eyes.
1:24:26|1:24:39|[Jia Wen] stared at [Zhang Zaishan] intently, waiting for those words to come out of his mouth. And [Zhang Zaishan] led her to the sandbag formation, slowly raising [Jia Wen]'s hand.
1:24:46|1:24:53|[Jia Wen] nodded with tears in her eyes, not daring to let her guard down. The tape was torn open, and [Zhang Zaishan] peeled it off layer by layer in circles.
1:24:55|1:25:3|Finally, the tape was completely unwrapped, and [Zhang Zaishan] held her hand, approaching the sandbag formation.
1:25:9|1:25:25|At the moment the hand grenade was released, [Zhang Zaishan] grabbed her and ran towards the road. The explosion pushed the two of them down, and [Jia Wen], who was terrified, burrowed into [Zhang Zaishan]'s arms. [Zhang Zaishan] held her tightly as they turned back to look at the sandbag barrier that had been blown up.
1:25:25|1:25:38|The clouds rolled and the clouds scattered, and another night passed. In the early morning at the entrance of the tunnel, the police officers were still holding their ground. The overturned car on the road, the weary mercenaries in the tunnel, all silently hoped for this bomb crisis to end soon.
1:25:44|1:25:48|After reaching a consensus, the old men with graying temples paid attention to the movements outside the car.
1:26:44|1:26:58|In the tunnel, [Hong Jipeng] made a phone call. At the same time, in [Jia Wen]'s bedroom, [Zhang Zaishan] looked at her sleeping, reached out to tidy her hair, and gently pushed [Jia Wen].
1:27:2|1:27:8|[Zhang Zaishan] had just stood up when he was embraced by [Jia Wen], who buried her head deeply in his shoulder. [Zhang Zaishan] also held her tightly.
1:27:9|1:27:28|[Zhang Zaishan] patted her back and softly agreed. With a positive response, a natural smile finally appeared on [Jia Wen]'s face. Then [Jia Wen] reached into the bag on the bedside table, took out a small seal, and gently stamped it on [Zhang Zaishan]'s hand back. The pattern was a thumbs-up gesture.
1:27:29|1:27:45|[Zhang Zaishan] was amused by her playful actions. Just as [Zhang Zaishan] was about to leave, he immediately turned back to kiss [Jia Wen] on the lips. This kiss was deep and intense, as if trying to dispel all the previous unpleasantness. After the kiss,
1:27:45|1:27:51|[Zhang Zaishan] got up and left, with a look of happiness on [Jia Wen]'s face. As [Zhang Zaishan] reached the door, he said to the officer.
1:27:53|1:28:16|Shortly after [Zhang Zaishan] walked through the entrance, he pressed the elevator button and waited. While waiting for the elevator, he took out his phone from his pocket and texted [Jia Wen], "Be happy if you can." The elevator arrived. [Zhang Zaishan] walked into the elevator while still editing his message on the phone. The elevator doors slowly closed.
1:28:16|1:28:23|[Zhang Zaishan] walked into the office and came face to face with [Yin Xiaofeng] and [Governor Jiang].
1:28:31|1:28:37|On the other side, [Yan Guorong] led a group of bodyguards downstairs. Just as the bodyguards opened the car door, an off-road vehicle rushed towards them.
1:28:46|1:29:1|Several bodyguards supported [Yan Guorong] as they hurriedly fled towards the building, but how could the gangsters let him go so easily. Faced with a large group of armed gangsters, even though the bodyguards were armed, they were still heavily suppressed in firepower. Jin Chuan's [Yan Guorong] had never seen such a scene before, with gunshots and smoke filling the air, leaving him feeling completely at a loss.
1:29:1|1:29:6|Yan Guorong, who had no one to support him, fell into the fountain pool as his bodyguards fell one after another.
1:29:10|1:29:22|The bandits took [Yan Guorong] into the car, the Mercedes quickly drove down the stairs and made a U-turn, stepping on the gas and leaving in a cloud of dust. In a secret room, [Yan Guorong] sat on the ground with a gun pointed at his head.
1:29:41|1:29:48|The henchman reported to [Hong Jipeng] over the phone. After completing the mission, the henchmen locked [Yan Guorong] in the truck compartment.
1:29:55|1:30:2|After the bandits had completely gone, they detonated the bomb on the truck and began [Hong Jipeng]'s helicopter rescue plan.
1:30:18|1:30:25|Dr. Niu opened the van door and bent down in front of his brother.
1:30:27|1:30:34|The younger brother opened his mouth but couldn't speak. On the other side, [Zhang Zaishan] received a phone call.
1:31:13|1:31:19|[Zhang Zaishan] would not sit idly by, he arrived at the explosives warehouse, while [Hong Jipeng]'s helicopter was already heading towards the Red Tunnel.
1:31:19|1:31:34|Two planes flicker red lights in the night sky. At the scene of the red tunnel, police surround layer by layer, while [Zhang Zaishan] chooses to negotiate with [Hong Jipeng] alone. At the tunnel entrance, [Governor Jiang] is holding his breath, eager to confront head-on, then he picks up the walkie-talkie by his collar.
1:31:38|1:31:48|In the battle plan, which only lasted for a short hour, [Hong Jipeng] led the way in the tunnel, with mercenaries pushing [Hong Jibiao] closely behind, heading towards the tunnel entrance.
1:31:48|1:32:3|In the command room, [Yin Xiaofeng] watches [Zhang Zaishan] on the monitor. At this moment, he is striding towards the tunnel, his steps firm and quick. Faced with the warning from the mercenaries, he raises his hand and shoots one down.
1:32:23|1:32:35|The mercenaries surrounded him with guns, but dared not take a step forward. The atmosphere dropped to freezing point. Even a group of ruthless bandits, who wouldn't bat an eye at killing, were particularly nervous when their own lives were at stake, except for [Hong Jipeng].
1:32:43|1:32:52|The mercenaries became nervous first, raising their guns and getting ready to shoot Zhang Zaishan at any moment. Zhang Zaishan looked at the mercenaries with a determined and fierce gaze.
1:33:3|1:33:10|Bluntly, they came for the money, not to lose their lives. Just as the three were about to leave, [Hong Jipeng] fired his gun first, [Zhang Zaishan] hid behind the car and shot [Hong Jipeng] in the thigh with a backhand shot. In the tunnel, special police suddenly parachuted down.
1:33:10|1:33:21|Outside the tunnel, upon Governor Jiang's command, the police officers immediately took action. At the other end, the police officers from Hong Kong Island also rushed towards the tunnel, where the three old men were trapped in the car.
1:33:21|1:33:32|[Huang Tiannuo]'s father, who had been waiting for a long time, made up his mind to die with his empty wrist. The special police suppressed with rifles, while [Hong Jipeng], who got the money, just wanted to leave safely.
1:33:45|1:33:52|With only his henchman pushing the stretcher of [Hong Jibiao] left, [Zhang Zaishan] shouted towards the passengers inside the car.
1:33:53|1:34:0|Well-trained officers lined up and ran in the tunnel, while the hired mercenaries, who were like sitting ducks, were still fighting back.
1:34:10|1:34:14|He directed the evacuation of the hostages, while the special police were responsible for the main suppression, and the mercenaries fought back while retreating, with the battle space continuously shrinking.
1:34:18|1:34:29|On the bus, the hostages rushed off in panic. [Hong Jipeng]'s henchman hid behind the bus and opened fire, but all the bullets were blocked by the bulletproof shield. [Zhang Zaishan], who was hiding behind the bus, glanced at his watch, realizing that he didn't have much time left.
1:34:29|1:34:45|After evacuating the hostages, Governor Jiang led his team to catch up. At the entrance of the Hong Tunnel, a helicopter arrived to pick up Hong Jipeng. The pilot, seeing the military helicopter above, immediately raised his hands in surrender. As the helicopter landed at the Kowloon entrance, it was surrounded by police officers, with special forces holding rifles and shouting commands.
1:34:49|1:35:2|The foreign driver surrendered before getting off the plane. Inside the Red Tunnel, chaos ensued as cars jammed the main road, with hostages fleeing in panic between the vehicles. On the Kowloon side, special police and officers suppressed firepower while steadily advancing.
1:35:2|1:35:15|The hostages, who were trying to escape, screamed in panic as they ran for cover, while the mercenaries fell one after another in the gunfire. Governor Jiang evacuated the remaining hostages. Finally, Zhang Zaishan, who was approaching the car slowly, spotted Hong Jipeng through the glass.
1:35:15|1:35:26|A gunshot rang out, [Hong Jipeng] shattered the glass obstructing [Zhang Zaishan]'s line of sight. In the chaos, the younger brothers had no time to attend to [Hong Jibiao] on the stretcher, while the old men hiding in the car waited for the opportunity to drive away.
1:35:26|1:35:41|In the face of disaster, [Hong Jibiao], who was unable to act, was left in the middle of the road. Suddenly a bullet hit his body, and blood sprayed out instantly. The fleeing mercenaries even knocked the stretcher spinning on the road. The mercenaries opened the car door as cover, and [Governor Jiang] shot and killed them.
1:35:41|1:36:0|Following that, the mercenaries fleeing the scene arrived at the car door, with the old men dividing their roles clearly. One person went for a chokehold from inside the car, another grabbed the gun, while a third launched a frontal attack. The fleeing hostage hastily pulled open the escape door, inadvertently triggering the explosion that engulfed them.
1:36:8|1:36:18|[A Bin], who was leading the charge, suddenly ran out of bullets. He then jumped onto a car, tackled two enemies to the ground, seized a pistol, and ended their lives.
1:36:24|1:36:35|The gangsters also targeted Governor Jiang, sneaking up to the second floor of the bus from the other staircase. Not seeing Governor Jiang, they headed towards the hostages.
1:36:37|1:36:57|Governor Jiang, who arrived, fired a burst of shots, hitting the bandits and causing them to fall off the bus after breaking the glass. Governor Jiang then continued to shoot down at the bandits from a high vantage point. Meanwhile, Zhang Zaishan, who was quietly approaching, suddenly got shot in the leg. Inside the car, Hong Jipeng shouted loudly.
1:36:59|1:37:15|[Zhang Zaishan] and [Hong Jipeng] were shooting at each other across several cars. Seeing it was difficult to effectively suppress the enemy, [Zhang Zaishan] got into the car and stepped on the gas pedal. The car moved forward while he continued shooting. In the congested tunnel, cars quickly collided one after another, and in this way, one car after another jammed [Hong Jipeng]'s car door.
1:37:15|1:37:34|Shortly afterwards, the bomb on his chest was removed and thrown towards [Hong Jipeng]. Both of them hurriedly reversed their cars, crashing through the congested vehicles on the road. Suddenly, [Zhang Zaishan] advanced instead of retreating, holding the detonator as he charged towards [Hong Jipeng]. Halfway there, he pressed the detonator. The explosion cleared the vehicles on the road.
1:37:34|1:37:48|[Hong Jipeng] felt he was being played, angrily driving the car and shooting wildly. [Zhang Zaishan] was even more fearless, roaring and firing his gun. The two cars approached each other head-on, continuing until they ran out of bullets and then both stepped on the gas pedal to collide with the same car.
1:38:8|1:38:23|[Hong Jipeng] took out a detonator to show [Zhang Zaishan], then detonated it in front of him. [Zhang Zaishan] got angry, stepped on the gas pedal, causing the tires to rub against the ground, creating a sudden burst of smoke. As a result, the two cars squeezed the middle car, causing it to start spinning due to uneven force.
1:38:23|1:38:39|Until three cars were lined up side by side, [Zhang Zaishan] first smashed [Hong Jipeng]'s side mirror, only to find out in astonishment that his bullets had run out. As he was changing the magazine inside the car, [Hong Jipeng] climbed onto the middle car through the window. [Zhang Zaishan] wanted to make a move, but the thick smoke obscured his vision.
1:38:39|1:38:52|As he leaned closer, the submachine gun held by [Hong Jipeng] was already pointed at his forehead from the car window. Suddenly, a car swiftly crashed into the rear of [Hong Jipeng]'s car, causing the car to crash on the spot, and his arm holding the gun was thus crushed.
1:39:14|1:39:21|[Hong Jipeng] was pressed on the roof of the car by the armed police, but he let out a twisted laugh. His younger brother [Hong Jibiao] lay on a stretcher, shot multiple times and became a casualty of the battle.
1:39:36|1:39:50|In the long tunnel, he is the figure going against the flow, passing through the crowded people. This time, without any assistance, he goes alone, hoping to snatch back a few more lives from the hands of death. A shot in the calf makes him run unsteadily, while the hostages run towards the nearest exit door, no longer in a panic.
1:40:3|1:40:19|Police officers maintained order, pointed the way, endured nearly 72 hours of hardship, and when they stepped out of the tunnel, the world in each of their hearts lit up. [A Bin] arrived at the truck, pushed open the door, jumped onto the cargo compartment, and upon shining a flashlight inside, discovered that the compartment was filled with explosives and detonators.
1:40:30|1:40:48|In the carriage, [A Bin] opens the floor. What catches his eye is a dense tangle of detonation cords, all twisted and intertwined. "It's a mess," [A Bin] guesses. With that, he quickly jumps off the carriage.
1:40:50|1:40:54|Under the car, [A Bin] turns on a flashlight, pries open the iron cover, and advises his colleague.
1:41:8|1:41:16|He crouched down, supporting his legs, and pounced towards the truck. The wound on his calf was bleeding profusely, but he paid no attention to it. He pushed open the truck door, but the excessive blood loss left him physically exhausted.
1:41:17|1:41:25|He almost rolled and crawled into the carriage. When he struggled to stand up holding onto the cardboard box, he realized something was missing.
1:42:14|1:42:31|Outside the tunnel, people dare not linger and quickly run away. After a brief search, Zhang Zaishan finds the detonator and gently removes the casing. The countdown time of the detonator catches his eye, with only 3 minutes and over 50 seconds left. Tick-tock, time passes by, and a plan forms in his mind.
1:43:5|1:43:13|A few words seemed to exhaust all his strength, outside the tunnel.
1:43:24|1:43:30|[Zhang Zaishan] stared with his handsome eyes. He paused and said.
1:43:40|1:44:4|Taking a deep breath, [Zhang Zaishan] clenched his teeth and uttered these words. He closed his eyes, swallowed hard, and breathed heavily as drops of engine oil fell on his cheeks. With just over two minutes left on the timer, there were only two wires connecting it. Outside the tunnel, fire trucks, police cars, and command vehicles blared their sirens, urgently evacuating the scene.
1:44:4|1:44:12|The alarm sounds one after another, and the last few police cars also leave one after another. The disheveled [Zhang Zaishan] presses the walkie-talkie.
1:44:50|1:45:15|Long-time partner [A Bin] knows the outcome well. He can only grit his teeth and give an affirmative answer. [Zhang Zaishan] reached out and gently pushed aside the red wire. His left fingertip touched the yellow wire, while his right hand held the pliers and slowly approached. His dirty right hand was covered in sweat, blood, and engine oil, with the most eye-catching feature being a tiger paw print.
1:45:15|1:45:38|The engine oil slid from his cheek to his ear, [Zhang Zaishan] closed his eyes again. Also tonight, [Jia Wen] sat at the head of the bed in the bedroom. Suddenly she remembered something and picked up the phone on the bedside table. After unlocking it, she looked at the text message on the phone, which was the same one as last time, "Be happy, you can do it." At this moment, [Zhang Zaishan] picked up the walkie-talkie again and said.
1:45:41|1:45:55|[A Bin] is under the car wearing a helmet, sweating profusely, frowning, waiting for news.
1:45:56|1:46:11|[Zhang Zaishan] clenched his right hand to cut the yellow wire. In the bedroom, [Jia Wen] looked at the text message and smiled. She noticed a large blank space in the message, then continued to scroll down boredly. Suddenly, three words appeared before her eyes: I love you.
1:47:13|1:47:29|With sobs shaking her shoulders, she slid her fingertips repeatedly, tears streaming down her face. It turned out that the words she had been waiting for had already been spoken by [Zhang Zaishan]. She kept flipping through the text messages, tears breaking out each time. The last sentence of the message was, "I said it."
1:47:30|1:47:40|The time froze at 3:11 in the afternoon, and everything seemed too late. If I could have seen it earlier, understood his intentions sooner, that would have been satisfying.
1:47:40|1:48:1|[Jia Wen], with red eyes, tried hard to control her emotions. Tears fell instinctively. At the scene of the underwater tunnel, most of the police cars and fire trucks that retreated in time were unharmed. The tunnel entrance was filled with smoke and dust, desolate. The officers pushed [A Bin] on a stretcher to the ambulance, and everyone together lifted him up.
1:48:1|1:48:10|The policewoman sitting on the roadside wept with [Governor Jiang].
1:48:30|1:48:46|Sadness filled the hearts of every police officer. Hong Kong Cemetery. The coffins of the officers were neatly arranged next to a deep pit. The music of mourning played, and all the officers stood on the lawn, looking solemn, dressed in formal attire. In the front rows, the family members held the photos of the deceased in their hands against their chests.
1:48:46|1:49:2|[Jia Wen] stood in the center, holding a photo of [Zhang Zaishan]. In the photo, he looked serious and didn't smile, exuding a dignified and handsome charm. Amidst the sorrowful music, everyone present bowed their heads in silent tribute.
