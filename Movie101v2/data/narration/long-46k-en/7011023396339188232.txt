0:0:31|0:0:42|The dark night seemed to be painted with thick ink on the horizon, not even a trace of starlight could be seen. In the mountains and forests, a group of fairies disguised as humans, singing and dancing, creating a lively atmosphere.
0:1:9|0:1:22|In this film, the first part tells the story of [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] embarking on a journey to find [Song Tianyin]'s father after parting ways with [Tu Sigou]. With the help of [Yun Qing], they discover the cunning scheme of [Song Tianyin]'s father, and [Tu Sigou], who has returned to Yongning Village, is once again pursued by the Demon King.
0:2:6|0:2:17|Little [Huo Xiaolan] watched everyone panting and jumping around, extremely happy. Just then, half of the Blood Demon's head emerged from the ground.
0:2:23|0:2:32|Before everyone could react, a huge and muscular blood demon burst out of the ground and charged towards [Huo Ba]. Seeing this, [Pang Ying] quickly picked up [Huo Ba] and fled towards the outskirts of the village.
0:2:39|0:2:50|Cornered, the desperate couple [Tu Sigou] and [Huo Xiaolan] held onto each other as they were surrounded by three blood demons. Just as the group was at a loss, the ground beneath their feet suddenly cracked open. A larger, four-winged demon leaped out from underground, sending everyone flying several yards away.
0:2:50|0:3:5|[Zhu Gao] saw that [Huo Ba] was about to fall into the hands of Xiaoyao, so he shouted for [Pang Ying] to run. Then [Pang Ying] forcefully threw the slender [Zhu Gao] away. Just as [Huo Xiaolan] was about to fall, the blood demon rushed forward to intercept, and [Tu Sigou] quickly threw [Huo Xiaolan] towards Xiaowu.
0:3:5|0:3:12|At this moment, the four blood demons rushed towards the fleeing Xiaowu like mad. [Tu Sigou] and others also chased after them, with [Tu Sigou] devising a battle plan.
0:3:18|0:3:29|The group of people formed a moving formation, passing [Huo Xiaolan] to each other with tacit understanding. At this moment, a desperate blood demon failed to dodge and hit a tree, then another blood demon pounced towards Xiao Wu.
0:3:35|0:3:42|Tu Sigou jumped up and slammed Huo Xiaolan's head against the tree trunk. Just then, several villagers lifted a tree trunk together and smashed it towards the two blood demons flying towards them.
0:3:43|0:3:50|The blood demon fell to the ground, lying motionless, at this moment [Huo Xiaolan] slowly descended from the tree, while the four-winged demon nearby roared angrily at the sky.
0:3:51|0:4:4|Immediately, using its strong tail, Tu Sigou flung everyone away one after another, then looked ferociously at the baby-like Huo Xiaolan. In the same manner, after flinging Huo Xiaolan into the air, Yun Qing firmly caught her. Without any hesitation, Boss Zhu, the four-winged demon who completed the task, spread its wings and flew into the air.
0:4:4|0:4:16|At this moment, two villagers suddenly grabbed its feet. Tu Sigou turned around and saw three more villagers flying from the ground, firmly holding onto it, preventing it from flying away. The villagers tightly held onto the ankles of the person in front, dragging the Four-Winged Demon like a chain.
0:4:20|0:4:34|After that, [Tu Sigou] and Pang Ying climbed up the human ladder formed by the villagers, and when they reached the top of the Four-Winged Demon, the two of them leaped high together and then heavily smashed down on the Four-Winged Demon. The tall figure of [Tu Sigou] was stunned by the collective force of the people, but the little Hu Ba in its hand accidentally rolled into the nearby river.
0:4:34|0:4:43|At this moment, [Pang Ying] and [Zhu Gao] had just stood up when they were knocked down by the tail of [Tu Sigou]. Worriedly, [Pang Ying] asked:
0:5:26|0:5:45|A gust of demon wind swept through the cave, lifting the golden sand from the ground. The sand particles intertwined in the air, forming the title of the film "Monster Hunt 2". Poor little Huba drifted in the river all night, and the sudden waterfall made Huba widen his eyes, while the water flow also accelerated.
0:5:47|0:6:0|Huo Xiaolan, who was far away in the inn, frowned as Huba was unexpectedly swept down to a waterfall nearly a hundred meters high. In the instant that Huba fell to the bottom of the cliff, she saw the swift current for a moment.
0:6:2|0:6:8|After listening, Doctor Tu Sigou checked Xiaolan's pulse and said to the assistant beside him:
0:7:8|0:7:24|The doctor beckoned, and [Song Tianyin] approached. He directly pinched his nose and shook it, saying, "8528 Assistant saw the doctor's gesture and picked up a piece of white cloth, took a handful of soil from the nearby flowerpot, and placed it on the table."
0:7:24|0:7:37|While she was about to pack up, the doctor stopped her, dipped his finger in the soil, tasted it, and then handed the packed items to [Huo Xiaolan].
0:8:1|0:8:12|[Huo Xiaolan] hurriedly left with [Song Tianyin], as people lining up for medical treatment. [Huo Xiaolan] looked tenderly at a baby in a mother's arms, feeling a surge of longing for Huba.
0:8:13|0:8:35|Xiaolan then walked to the side and said to [Song Tianyin]: At this moment, a pregnant woman with a big belly rushed towards Xiaolan. Feeling something strange, Xiaolan pushed hard and ended up bouncing herself out of the window. Xiaolan questioned why the pregnant woman was unharmed and asked aggressively.
0:8:37|0:8:53|After finishing speaking, Xiaolan swiftly pasted the talisman on her forehead, causing the pregnant woman to be unable to move again. It turned out to be a demon. While she was still immersed in the applause, six demons wearing human skins appeared on the roof.
0:8:53|0:9:11|The six demons leaped down and landed beside the leader who had just been immobilized, tearing off the talisman on his forehead. Immediately, the seven demons growled lowly and assumed a fighting stance. Seeing the situation turning unfavorable, Xiaolan kicked over a bamboo basket and ran into the crowd. With a command from the leader, the monsters chased after, making strange noises, while the people hurriedly fled.
0:9:11|0:9:20|Although the demon was wearing human skin, when chasing people, it still used both hands and feet, crawling on the ground. Upon seeing this, [Song Tianyin] on the second floor also jumped down and immediately chased after them.
0:9:21|0:9:35|Huo Xiaolan, running at this moment, was almost knocked down by the approaching monster. She dared not slack off at all, and could only run desperately in the face of the monster. Just then, a monster suddenly sprang out from the front path, blocking Xiaolan's way. Surrounded, Xiaolan quickly drew out her magic rope and leaped up.
0:9:36|0:9:44|A whip knocked down the monster blocking the road, while [Song Tianyin] behind then comforted the elderly man who was hit, and entrusted the luggage to him.
0:9:50|0:9:58|Facing the attacks of the monsters, [Huo Xiaolan], who was struggling, swung the magic rope towards the top of the city wall, preparing to escape. Looking at the airborne [Huo Xiaolan], the monsters seemed unwilling to give up.
0:9:58|0:10:17|With a strong leap, he embraced her tightly. At this moment, other monsters rushed over, and a running monster collided with a mother holding a baby on the road, sending the baby flying far away. [Song Tianyin] saw the baby in the air and without hesitation, he leaped to catch him securely, only to crash heavily into the wall the next second.
0:10:17|0:10:26|Song Tianyin, who had just regained consciousness, breathed a sigh of relief as he looked at the baby in his arms. On the other side, Huo Xiaolan, who was lying on the ground, struggled hard with the rope, watching as the almost bitten-through rope was skillfully loosened.
0:10:26|0:10:34|As soon as Ke Gang stood up, he was heavily hit on the head, causing him to feel dizzy. Facing the siege of the powerful demon, [Huo Xiaolan] could only force herself to not collapse.
0:10:35|0:10:51|As long as they all move forward to firmly control her, the boss jumps into the air and smashes towards [Huo Xiaolan]. Suddenly, the boss in the air is pulled away by a magic rope. Before everyone can react, the other six monsters are also pulled away one after another and placed on the city wall. When [Huo Xiaolan] looks up along the rope.
0:10:51|0:11:5|A man in Taoist robes with a furry tail flew over from above and landed steadily on the high platform. After locking eyes with [Huo Xiaolan] and [Song Tianyin], the man's identity was almost certain. The common people, who only realized it later, watched the demon-slaying celestial master with such skill as if they were seeing a hero, excitedly applauding.
0:11:5|0:11:14|Both being celestial masters, [Huo Xiaolan] looked at him with a hint of dissatisfaction, while the man turned back and smiled and waved at [Huo Xiaolan].
0:11:42|0:11:54|[Huo Xiaolan] shook her head, and [Song Tianyin] asked after seeing the man's waist badge. The man didn't answer in a hurry, but walked up and took the leaves off [Song Tianyin]'s body, asking back:
0:12:6|0:12:14|After saying that, [Yun Qing] left gracefully. Walking among the crowd, [Yun Qing] was constantly praised by the people with thumbs up. Walking on the street, [Huo Xiaolan] pondered and said:
0:12:27|0:12:43|The two had just taken a few steps when they heard thunder in the distance. [Huo Xiaolan] looked at the dark clouds and said, "At this moment, [Huo Xiaolan] noticed a doll made of cloth that looked like a Hu Ba model made by [Song Tianyin]."
0:13:1|0:13:20|Tu Sigou, who was knocked unconscious by the waterfall at the same time, drifted on the lake along the water flow. After waking up, Tu Sigou walked to the shore and shook off the water on his body like a little dog. He stood on a dry tree trunk, staring at the unfamiliar forest with big eyes, feeling a bit lost for a moment. Then he aimlessly walked through the woods.
0:13:20|0:13:27|Tu Sigou didn't brighten up until he walked in front of [Yun Qing], who swallowed him without hesitation, but spat him out after just a few chews.
0:13:30|0:13:35|Huba looked up at the sky along the floating dandelions, where Yun Qing's shape resembled a family of three holding hands.
0:13:36|0:13:53|Watching this scene with [Yun Qing], Tu Sigou also recalled the happy times with Huo Xiaolan. Suddenly, a roar interrupted Tu Sigou's reminiscence. Tu Sigou quickly hid behind a tree. Before he could catch his breath, he saw a child dressed in a monster costume appear behind him.
0:13:53|0:14:1|Huo Ba turned around and burst into laughter at the extremely ugly stitched clothing.
0:14:8|0:14:16|At this moment, the friends all rushed over and stared blankly at Hu Ba. One of them approached and said:
0:14:24|0:14:57|A group of children chased Huba through the woods, they were in the mountains next to Qingshui Town. Suddenly, shouts broke the original peace and tranquility of Jinshui Town. Little did they know, the children chased Huba into the bustling town, where one of them fell down, causing Huba, hidden in the dragon lion headgear, to laugh.
0:14:57|0:15:14|Following the laughter, everyone looked towards [Huo Xiaolan] in unison. Sensing trouble, [Huo Xiaolan] jumped out of the lion's head and ran away. Running through the streets and alleys, [Huo Xiaolan] hid behind a carriage. Just as it was about to look back at the pursuers, a monster's big hand grabbed it away.
0:15:27|0:15:34|At this moment, the monster Tu Sigou, who can turn invisible in the car, slowly appears while holding Huo Xiaolan.
0:15:35|0:15:44|Before [Tu Sigou] could even laugh, the child who had heard the noise opened the car door again. Fortunately, [Tu Sigou] reacted quickly and disappeared again the moment the door opened.
0:15:45|0:15:50|Later, everyone gathered at the car door and confirmed once again before saying:
0:15:57|0:16:9|After the children walked away, Tu Sigou slowly appeared. The tall and round Tu Sigou placed Huoba on the seat, patting its head and making funny faces to amuse Huoba.
0:16:9|0:16:17|[Huo Ba] happily pulled [Tu Benben]'s head, although it hurt, Tu Benben was not angry, he rubbed his head and asked Huo Ba where he came from.
0:16:18|0:16:24|[Huo Ba] jumped off his seat, walked to the wooden door and paused for a moment, then used his teeth to bite out the shape of the cloud he had just seen on the wooden board.
0:16:26|0:16:38|Benny suddenly realized when he saw Tu Sigou, and a noisy sound came from the courtyard wall next to the carriage. Following the sound into the yard, it turned out to be the gambling den of Qingshui Town.
0:16:44|0:16:58|Inside the casino, divided into 3 levels, there are 10 gambling tables, luxuriously decorated. On the second floor at a baccarat table, Tu Sigou, dressed in a suit of golden armor, placed several hundred taels of silver on the banker.
0:17:20|0:17:27|[Tu Sigou] followed the sound and saw a graceful and sexy beauty coming down the stairs. The beauty walked slowly to the opposite side of [Tu Sigou], exchanged a glance, and said,
0:17:48|0:18:3|Tu Sigou pushed all the silver ingots to the middle of the table. He then picked up three dice and placed them in front of the beautiful woman. After blowing into the dice cup, he threw the dice in one by one, shaking them a few times before slamming them heavily on the table.
0:18:5|0:18:11|And at this moment, the little monster hidden in the dice cup quickly manipulated the dice to all show 6.
0:18:12|0:18:26|[Tu Sigou] saw a beautiful woman and slid the dice cup from the table to her hand. The woman calmly caught the dice cup and smoothly rolled up her right sleeve. Then she picked up the dice cup, skillfully scooped up the dice on the table, and quickly started shaking them with lightning speed.
0:18:26|0:18:29|A simple pause made the little monster in the colored cup dizzy.
0:18:30|0:18:40|As everyone was eagerly anticipating the dice roll, the beautiful woman tossed the dice cup into the air. She crossed her arms and caught the cup, letting it roll from high to low to the other arm's elbow. Then, she suddenly raised her elbow and tossed the cup into the air again.
0:18:40|0:18:56|In front of the stunned crowd, the beauty spun around and then, with the help of a color cup, forcefully slammed it on the table. She glanced at [Tu Sigou] and then suddenly lifted the color cup. After hearing a burst of whispers, the beauty looked incredulously at the three ones on the table. Just then, the little monster inside the color cup spit out.
0:19:27|0:19:39|[Tu Sigou] saw the situation was not good and ran downstairs. But before he could take a few steps, he was blocked by the thugs. The thugs quickly surrounded him, but unexpectedly, [Tu Sigou] slipped under the table like a cicada shedding its skin. Taking advantage of the chaos, the little monsters also quietly slipped away.
0:19:39|0:19:44|Tu Sigou, hiding under the table, took off his fake beard and sneaked out in the chaos, pointing downstairs and shouting, "Catch the thief!"
0:19:53|0:20:7|Faced with the pursuit of the crowd, he hurriedly ran up to the third floor. Passing by the gambling table, he scattered the silver coins on the table to the people behind him. As chaos ensued, [Tu Sigou] slid down from the third floor along a pillar to the first floor. After breaking through the heavy encirclement and pushing open the door of the gambling den, he shouted loudly:
0:20:12|0:20:26|Tu Sigou emerged from under the car with two legs, drove the car to Huo Xiaolan, who fastened the seat belt first after getting in the car. Meanwhile, Tu Sigou ran forward recklessly in the car. When the car reached a stone arch bridge, Tu Sigou took a deep breath, and their wooden car soared into the sky along the ramp.
0:20:34|0:20:49|When Benben realized what was happening, the wooden cart fell heavily from a height of several meters, but luckily it held together and did not fall apart. Just as Tu Sigou regained his senses, he quickly controlled the direction of the cart to avoid obstacles, drifting the cart into a narrow alleyway. Even at such a speed, he still couldn't shake off the pursuers behind him.
0:20:49|0:21:6|[Tu Sigou] was still worried about the pursuers when another group of people and horses appeared ahead. Seeing this, [Tu Sigou] urgently slammed on the brakes, patted the carriage, and shouted loudly. Hearing this, the person named Beng Beng quickly turned around and ran towards a tunnel.
0:21:8|0:21:12|The notorious Tu Sigou is wanted even by the elderly with white hair.
0:21:13|0:21:38|When about to be caught up, the car drove out of the tunnel, pulling down the wooden curtain in passing, causing the pursuers to fall to the ground. Upon hearing the command, [Tu Sigou] turned around and ran again. As [Tu Sigou] turned into a small road, he looked around and pressed a switch in the car. Then a curtain, blending in with the wall, quickly dropped down.
0:21:44|0:21:57|The alerted thug rushed out of the curtain and continued to chase. As they were about to hit the extremely narrow alley, [Tu Sigou] took a deep breath, and the car seemed to slim down as if inhaling. Passing through the narrow alley, [Tu Sigou] weaved through the streets with left and right turns.
0:21:57|0:22:13|Even so, [Tu Sigou] couldn't shake off the pursuers. He went through the alley and set up another trick with a cloth curtain. The pursuers, without thinking, rushed out when they saw it, only to find out that there was a pond ahead. Unable to stop, they all fell into the pond.
0:22:14|0:22:22|[Tu Sigou] looked back at the people who fell into the water, leisurely walking from the town to the woods. In the evening, the little monster was angry and said,
0:23:48|0:23:56|Tu Sigou then kicked it into the woods, and Huo Xiaolan, seeing this, cursed:
0:24:5|0:24:11|While speaking, Tu Sigou picked up the freshly made porridge by Benben and took a sip.
0:24:43|0:24:48|[Tu Sigou] turned around and looked at [Huo Xiaolan], who had just finished drinking the porridge, and grabbed her by the hair, lifting her up.
0:24:58|0:25:7|After saying that, Tu Sigou kicked Huo Xiaolan into the woods with one kick. But as he turned around, he was knocked unconscious by a punch from the man in black.
0:25:10|0:25:25|The next morning, [Huo Xiaolan] and [Song Tianyin] arrived at the Tian Shi Tang as planned. Tian Shi Tang was built on the peak of the highest mountain next to Qing Shui Town. The magnificent architecture of Tian Shi Tang, built near the mountain, was enough to make all the demons retreat just by its momentum.
0:25:26|0:25:40|[Huo Xiaolan] and [Tu Sigou] arrived just in time for the distribution of grain at the Tian Shi Tang. As they passed through the huge main gate, they were stunned into silence by the majestic decoration of the main hall. In front of them hung giant chandeliers supported by 8 bronze beast statues, while on each side of the main entrance stood lifelike giant bronze qilins.
0:25:41|0:25:46|The grand hall was illuminated by hundreds of small lamps, shining brightly and magnificently.
0:25:46|0:26:6|At this moment, the two of them saw a monster hiding around, and just as they were puzzled, they heard the Taoist priest on the second floor shouting while holding a weapon, rushing towards the main entrance to stab the monster. They were blocked by [Huo Xiaolan] who was recording, and in a moment of urgency, the monster revealed its spikes and scared the two of them away. Three Taoist priests with weapons followed closely behind, and [Huo Xiaolan] couldn't bear to say,
0:26:16|0:26:22|Song Tianyin sighed as he looked at piles of gold and silver.
0:26:34|0:26:46|[Huo Xiaolan] taunted [Song Tianyin] and then walked upstairs. [Song Tianyin] was used to it and didn't pay much attention, following closely behind up the stairs of the Celestial Master's Hall. When they reached the open door of the Demon Hunting Court, which was empty, the two stopped in their tracks.
0:26:46|0:27:3|This place, although called the Demon-catching Pavilion, is more like a general store. The two of them walked in curiously, looking at the various tools. As they approached, they found that although the room was messy, it had everything. [Song Tianyin] couldn't help but curiously touch things. At this moment, voices came from behind the curtain.
0:28:50|0:28:54|After catching up with Song Tianyin who left in anger, Huo Xiaolan mischievously asked.
0:29:14|0:29:25|On the other side, in the magnificent Zhenjin Bank, the bank owner [Boss Zhu] in a black robe entered the hall. As [Boss Zhu] sat down, his subordinate walked up to the bound [Tu Sigou], dipped his hand in water, and then fiercely smashed it onto the unconscious [Tu Sigou].
0:29:25|0:29:36|The startled Tu Sigou looked around in confusion, then fixed his gaze on the familiar Boss Zhu sitting in the hall.
0:29:52|0:30:1|After speaking, [Huo Xiaolan] walked up to Tu Sigou and asked aggressively. Then she took out the contract signed by Tu Sigou.
0:30:36|0:30:48|Boss Zhu moved Tu Sigou's chair to the back. Eight tall and outstandingly beautiful women slowly walked down the stairs at the back. Boss Zhu said.
0:30:50|0:30:57|Tu Sigou looked at the fans with words written on them in their hands, knowing that this was not a beauty pageant, and then asked Boss Zhu with a look of melancholy.
0:31:3|0:31:14|[Tu Sigou] looked at the fan with the words "getting married" written on it by [Boss Zhu], and decided to make a choice. So [Boss Zhu] unlocked [Tu Sigou]'s handcuffs. Eight beautiful women across from him each held a ribbon, the ribbons crisscrossing in front of [Tu Sigou] making it difficult to distinguish.
0:31:14|0:31:20|[Tu Sigou] tried to be clever, picked up a ribbon and shook it, but found that all 8 ribbons were trembling together. Seeing this, [Tu Sigou] casually pulled one of them off.
0:31:30|0:31:41|When [Tu Sigou] looked back at the beauty, he saw her holding a wolf's tooth club, with countless spikes on his scalp, causing unbearable pain.
0:32:2|0:32:9|Shortly after [Tu Sigou] had his shoes removed and was tied to a chair, he was puzzled as a beautiful woman began tickling his feet with a feather.
0:32:28|0:32:35|At this moment, the henchman walked up to [Boss Zhu] and said.
0:32:40|0:33:0|After listening, [Boss Zhu] came to the award presenter with Huba's portrait. The first person to claim the prize brought out a human-shaped radish and placed it in front of [Boss Zhu]. The second one was a small dog with grass tied on its head, and the most exaggerated third one was an adult holding their own child pretending to be Huba.
0:33:10|0:33:17|Boss Zhu walked up to Tu Sigou, who had a pale face, and said to the beautiful women:
0:33:43|0:34:2|Upon hearing that, Tu Sigou nodded vigorously at Boss Zhu. Back at the Tian Shi Tang, Huo Xiaolan and Song Tianyin were playfully wrestling, and inadvertently stumbled upon a particularly solemn room with a sign reading "Wu Yao Ting" outside. Curious, they entered the room, where sunlight shone through a bagua-shaped window onto a table neatly set with memorial tablets.
0:34:2|0:34:9|Seeing the many memorial tablets, the two not only did not avoid them, but instead seemed more interested. [Song Tianyin] set down the backpack and walked to the middle of the row of tablets along the steps.
0:34:10|0:34:24|He immediately saw his father Song Dai Tian's tablet placed right in the middle. So [Song Tianyin] climbed onto the table to pick up the tablet and take a closer look, while [Huo Xiaolan] shouted.
0:34:40|0:34:50|Amidst everyone's astonishment, [Yun Qing] arrived with the team.
0:36:36|0:36:42|In the middle of the courtyard, Tu Sigou, Huo Xiaolan, and Song Tianyin stood. Yun Qing, seeing the confusion on their faces, introduced them.
0:37:10|0:37:25|After being struck by a stick, [Tu Sigou], the mother of the Thorn Demon, voluntarily lay on the disc of the Sands of Longing. As soon as she spoke, the disc slowly descended, and then she spat out a large amount of gravel from the dragon's mouth in front.
0:37:26|0:37:41|The delicate sand grains, under the shining sunlight, emitted a slightly dazzling light. When the sand reached a certain amount, the dragon's mouth stopped spitting sand. Instead, some of the fine sand in the huge sand pool intertwined and floated in the air, and for a moment, the fine sand in the air transformed into the appearance of small thorny demons.
0:37:41|0:37:52|In this scene, the first time [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] were stunned, even the little paper man of [Huo Xiaolan] the fairy was attracted to peek out. At this time, the transformed little thorn demon danced in the air.
0:37:52|0:37:56|Although made of gravel, the body movements and expressions are vividly restored, even the Demon Mother couldn't help but call out.
0:38:0|0:38:9|The mother of the demon looked tenderly at her son's figure, tears swirling in her eyes, but at this moment the sand transformed into the shape of a mountain peak near the Celestial Masters Sect.
0:38:17|0:38:29|After [Yun Qing] agreed to [Huo Xiaolan]'s request, in the blink of an eye, the group of celestial masters arrived at the foot of Tian Shu Cliff. The celestial masters split into two teams and searched for the little thorn demon in the woods. [Huo Xiaolan] noticed the claw marks left by the little thorn demon on the tree trunk but did not make a sound.
0:38:29|0:38:58|[Song Tianyin] suddenly shouted, and upon hearing his mother's voice, the Little Thorn Demon appeared from behind the tree trunk. [Song Tianyin] turned around to look at the Little Thorn Demon. Before his smile could linger for long, he was tackled to the ground by the Little Thorn Demon, who asked: At that moment, a Taoist priest threw a dart at the Little Thorn Demon.
0:38:58|0:39:16|After the Little Thorn Demon agilely dodged, it quickly escaped into the woods. Nearby, the Celestial Masters heard the commotion and rushed to support. As the Little Thorn Demon was fleeing in all directions, it was suddenly knocked down by a strike from [Song Tianyin] who leaped out from the side. When a Celestial Master swung a long axe towards the Little Thorn Demon, it was blocked by [Song Tianyin] with a sword.
0:39:23|0:39:30|At this moment, [Yun Qing] leaped from a distance, stepping on the shoulders of the two, performing a neat backflip and landing next to [Song Tianyin], with [Huo Xiaolan] hurrying over.
0:39:53|0:39:55|Huo Xiaolan then took the lead in squatting at the entrance where the little thorn demon had burrowed in.
0:39:56|0:40:3|Through the narrow opening, [Huo Xiaolan] saw the little thorn demon trembling, curled up in the corner, and said gently.
0:40:18|0:40:30|After listening to Xiao Ciyao's words, [Song Tianyin] looked at the Taoists with blame in his eyes. At this moment, [Huo Xiaolan] noticed the wound on Xiao Ciyao.
0:40:32|0:40:41|Song Tianyin looked happily at the Little Thorn Demon again after hearing it, and suddenly Huo Xiaolan at the cave entrance said to it sadly.
0:40:49|0:40:58|After hearing these words, Little Thorny couldn't contain her longing for her mother, and she started to cry in the cave. [Huo Xiaolan] looked gently at Little Thorny, and was reminded of Huba in a trance.
0:41:8|0:41:14|Although facing the Stinger 1 at this moment, the words spoken are more like a true expression of feelings towards [Huo Xiaolan].
0:41:15|0:41:24|Huo Xiaolan recalled the joys and sorrows with Huba, and remembered the scene when they separated. [Huo Xiaolan] stood from a mother's perspective and spoke to Little Thorny about the world.
0:41:49|0:42:10|Upon hearing the agreement from Tu Sigou, [Yun Qing] showed a relieved smile, while [Song Tianyin] gently comforted the distressed [Huo Xiaolan]. Subsequently, the little thorn demon took the initiative to leave the cave and walked towards the Tian Shi Tang with the others. On the other hand, in order to repay his debts, Tu Sigou returned to the woods where he had kicked Hu Ba away last night with Benben.
0:42:58|0:43:8|Tu Sigou finished speaking and continued to search for the scolded Benben, walking unhappily in the other direction. Unexpectedly, as soon as he turned around, he bumped into Hu Ba. Hu Ba happily opened his arms to hug Benben.
0:43:10|0:43:16|Just as Beng Beng was about to pick up Huba, he cleverly hid upon hearing the voice of [Tu Sigou].
0:43:22|0:43:36|Knowing about Benben's invisibility ability, [Tu Sigou] turned slowly towards the direction of a faint laughter. With a deep understanding of Benben, [Tu Sigou] kicked the stone in front of him.
0:43:50|0:43:58|After that, [Tu Sigou] and Benben took Xiaohuba to the car. They were each enjoying a corn on the cob when Benben's corn suddenly fell to the ground.
0:44:22|0:44:30|The mother walked through the bars of the cell, holding her son's hand to comfort him, then reached out to play with the little thorn demon.
0:44:58|0:45:16|After saying that, [Huo Xiaolan] turned around to look for the key on the shelf behind her. Seeing the key locked on the shelf, she unceremoniously picked up an iron rod and started smashing it. The harsh banging sound attracted the Taoist patrolling outside the door. Just as the Taoist was about to push the door open, he was pushed back by [Song Tianyin] inside the room.
0:45:16|0:45:24|Upon seeing the situation, the celestial master exerted all his strength to open the door. He looked in astonishment as the thorn demon mother and child emerged from the cage, when suddenly Tu Sigou struck a blow.
0:45:25|0:45:32|[Song Tianyin] stealthily jumped over from the celestial master and looked at [Huo Xiaolan] in confusion, when suddenly [Huo Xiaolan] had an idea.
0:45:34|0:45:44|Tu Sigou disguised the celestial master as if he were drunk. The celestial master looked confusedly at the keys and the bottle of wine in his hand.
0:45:57|0:46:5|In the money house, the beautiful women are dressing up for [Boss Zhu], who scolds them and then mutters to himself in front of the mirror.
0:46:7|0:46:18|Returning to the Celestial Master Temple once again, after releasing the little Thorn Demon, [Huo Xiaolan] was taking a bath in the room, while [Song Tianyin] struggled to use telekinesis to pour water into the bathtub for [Huo Xiaolan], as the water ladle wobbled and flew unsteadily from above the screen.
0:46:18|0:46:30|With the change of gestures by [Song Tianyin], the water scoop tilted and poured water on [Huo Xiaolan]. [Song Tianyin] then controlled the water ladle to scoop another ladle of water.
0:46:33|0:46:38|But this time, distracted [Song Tianyin] poured the water directly on [Huo Xiaolan]'s head.
0:46:46|0:46:52|Eating dried fruits nervously while sitting at the table, [Tu Sigou] spoke to [Huo Xiaolan].
0:47:11|0:47:15|Tu Sigou was waiting for Boss Zhu in the money house.
0:47:16|0:47:21|Shortly after, [Boss Zhu] emerged, dressed in luxurious attire and exquisite makeup, escorted by eight beautiful women.
0:47:22|0:47:31|Boss Zhu moved the fan in front of him aside, revealing an exceptionally delicate makeup.
0:48:4|0:48:10|Just then, [Tu Sigou] made a funny face to scare [Huo Xiaolan].
0:48:56|0:49:2|On the other side, [Huo Xiaolan] pouted and waited for [Song Tianyin] to come over, while [Song Tianyin] also pouted and moved closer.
0:50:6|0:50:12|In the room, [Huo Xiaolan] pouted again. [Song Tianyin], who had been hit twice, looked at [Huo Xiaolan] with lingering fear and dared not approach.
0:50:13|0:50:26|Just as Tu Sigou was trying to get closer to Huo Xiaolan, Boss Zhu scared Huo Xiaolan again. Seeing that Huo Xiaolan was not in the right state, Song Tianyin cleverly dodged backwards. At this moment, Tu Sigou's big face appeared in front of the two again.
0:50:26|0:50:42|Fearful [Huo Xiaolan] throws a dart forward, while [Tu Sigou] raises his hand to strike forward. But then he comes to his senses, looks at [Boss Zhu], and then proceeds to support her shoulder, saying.
0:50:44|0:50:51|At this moment, a dart sliced through Song Tianyin's belt, causing his pants to fall to the ground in front of Huo Xiaolan.
0:51:4|0:51:12|Tu Sigou, who walked out of the gate, found Benben laughing heartily.
0:51:29|0:51:44|Huo Xiaolan then showed it to him. Tu Sigou, who knew the truth, was filled with evil thoughts.
0:51:46|0:51:54|At this moment, Boss Zhu, accompanied by two followers, chased after them. Tu Sigou saw this and hurriedly stepped forward to speak.
0:52:8|0:52:17|Tu Sigou unexpectedly grabbed Boss Zhu's hand and placed it on his chest, saying affectionately.
0:52:19|0:52:26|The two attendants shook their heads desperately, while the deeply infatuated [Boss Zhu] nodded with affection.
0:52:38|0:52:51|[Tu Sigou] stamped his own handprint, and just as he was about to give it to [Boss Zhu], he romantically took out a handful of gold powder. He evenly sprinkled the gold powder on the large love character, blew off the excess powder, and handed it to [Boss Zhu] with a satisfied look on his face.
0:52:51|0:53:4|Boss Zhu took the oath and looked happily at the words above. Then Tu Sigou gestured for his men to hand over the silver. Seeing them hesitate, Tu Sigou forcefully took the silver and said to Boss Zhu.
0:53:4|0:53:23|After Boss Zhu nodded happily, Tu Sigou sat on the wooden cart and left with a flourish, waving to Boss Zhu along the way. Watching Tu Sigou's figure disappear into the distance, one of his men sighed.
0:53:39|0:53:47|Boss Zhu took a deep breath helplessly after watching, and asked his henchman next to him. The henchman next to him took out a loan record.
0:53:48|0:53:56|Boss Zhu took the neatly written record sheet and sighed, saying.
0:54:18|0:54:25|Outside the casino, three children angrily posted a notice on the wall, with crooked words written on it.
0:54:59|0:55:16|[Song Tianyin] looked at [Huo Xiaolan] without saying a word, and the scene shifted back to the casino. Disguised [Tu Sigou] was playing mahjong with his invisible companions Benben and Huba, while the three people sitting across from him had no idea that their cards were already seen through by [Tu Sigou].
0:55:36|0:55:40|At this moment, a tall and obese woman walked over.
0:55:53|0:56:1|[Cui] did not recognize [Tu Sigou] across from her. She gnawed on corn while playing with the cards, and [Tu Sigou] looked at [Cui], whose face was covered with corn kernels, with disdain.
0:56:2|0:56:9|Tu Sigou showed no signs of disgust at all. It kept looking at the delicious corn, licking its lips and making a sound.
0:56:19|0:56:27|After a sudden realization, [Song Tianyin] helped [Huo Xiaolan] onto the bed. Thinking that [Huo Xiaolan] was sick, [Song Tianyin] placed a damp towel on her forehead.
0:56:30|0:56:45|Tu Sigou, who hasn't won a hand for half a day, coughed twice to remind Benben. Benben, receiving the signal, moved Hu Ba to the other side to continue playing cards. Coincidentally, Xiaocui, after brewing for a long time, sneezed in Benben's direction.
0:56:46|0:56:58|The corn kernels in Xiaocui's mouth sprayed all over Tu Sigou's face when she sneezed. With Hu Xiaolan's loud scream, Tu Sigou quickly dodged and accidentally ripped off half of his fake beard. Tu Sigou hurriedly made up an excuse, saying,
0:57:8|0:57:13|As Xiaocui stood up, she grabbed [Tu Sigou] and pulled him in front of her, then yanked off his fake nose.
0:57:31|0:57:39|Xiansheng clumsily jumped from the second floor while holding [Huo Xiaolan], rolling to the front of the bronze mirror where [Huo Xiaolan] let out a scream.
0:57:47|0:57:54|[Tu Sigou] immediately pulled off his fake beard and ran towards the gate, but when he saw more thugs ahead, he had to turn and run towards the eaves of a nearby house.
0:58:6|0:58:14|Beng Beng, facing the pursuers, kicked down two people and struggled to climb onto the roof. In front, Tu Sigou easily reached the neighboring roof through the wooden planks between the two sides.
0:58:17|0:58:26|Beng Beng, who was soon caught up, cleverly jumped over and kicked off the wooden board. The lack of the wooden board caused the thugs to fall off the roof. After shaking off the thugs, he ran towards the car.
0:58:32|0:58:42|When about to catch Tu Sigou, the two groups of people coincidentally collided. Seizing the opportunity, Tu Sigou quickly ran out of the alley. After looking at the crowded street, he decisively chose the theater behind him.
0:58:42|0:58:51|After lifting the door curtain and taking a look around with Tu Sigou, they sneaked in together. At this moment, the belated thugs looked at the crowded street and lost their direction.
0:59:9|0:59:21|[Tu Sigou] saw a few thugs looking for him at the door through a crack. So he cleverly grabbed the paint on the table and smeared it in the corner, which piqued the curiosity of Hu Ba and Benben as they also came over.
0:59:22|0:59:31|Before long, the theater was brightly lit and various performances were being staged for the guests. The audience kept applauding and cheering for the acts on stage.
1:0:23|1:0:30|The burly man swung down the hammer, but the large stone on [Tu Sigou]'s chest remained intact. Seeing this awkward situation, [Tu Sigou] muttered quietly.
1:0:37|1:0:43|After the stone cracked, another heavy hammer struck Tu Sigou's chest, and the strong man looked at Tu Sigou spitting blood from his mouth.
1:0:52|1:0:59|Shortly after, [Tu Sigou] was supported and swayed to greet the audience, but who knew that right after stepping off the stage, [Tu Sigou] was pulled back up.
1:1:4|1:1:15|Before [Tu Sigou] could speak, he was pushed into a wooden box. The box was then brought onto the stage, and after the strong man displayed a sword to the audience, his partner opened the top of the wooden box.
1:1:29|1:1:46|Suo Ba stabbed the sword down from the wooden box. Soon, the wooden box was filled with swords.
1:1:47|1:1:54|At this moment, [Huo Xiaolan] on the side looked on with worry in her eyes as the lying [Tu Sigou] spoke to the burly man.
1:2:12|1:2:20|The audience held their breath, watching nervously as the saw blade slowly descended. As the saw blade finally dropped completely, [Tu Sigou] also closed his eyes.
1:2:21|1:2:27|[Huo Ba] watched this scene and cried heartbreakingly.
1:2:28|1:2:46|The audience, who were just cheering, quieted down. The strong man slowly moved the wooden box that had been cut in half. He swung his arms in the middle, indicating that there was no connection. Little [Huo Xiaolan] cried even more sadly after seeing it, and then the strong man slowly closed the cut wooden box.
1:2:46|1:3:5|Seeing [Huo Xiaolan] cry more and more sadly, the silly An comforted her on the side, saying, "That's not real." At this moment, the strong man opened the box, and when the box opened, [Tu Sigou] woke up unharmed. The audience, which had been silent just now, burst into thunderous applause.
1:3:5|1:3:24|With a bewildered look on his face, [Tu Sigou] is helped up and then walks off the stage to show the audience. In the dressing room, exhausted both physically and mentally, [Tu Sigou] takes off the tiger costume and casually throws the tiger gloves behind him. This is when the crying [Huo Ba] in his arms turns to [Tu Sigou].
1:3:24|1:3:31|Dad [Hu Ba] saw [Tu Sigou] alive and happily pounced on him, rubbing against him non-stop.
1:3:34|1:3:41|[Tu Sigou] placed [Huo Ba] on the ground and looked at the little monster who was crying uncontrollably because of him, feeling a slight ripple in his heart at that moment.
1:3:42|1:3:57|Tu Sigou watched Huo Xiaolan jumping around like watching his own child. Even the silly Benshen next to him showed a pleased smile. With great joy, Huo Xiaolan bounced out of the door, and Tu Sigou followed closely behind.
1:3:57|1:4:5|Halfway through, seeing her own appearance, [Huo Xiaolan] casually picked up a blanket and draped it over herself. Just as she stepped out the door, she heard the voices of a few children not far away discussing something.
1:4:12|1:4:21|Upon hearing this, the children all ran towards [Huo Xiaolan], and just as they were about to leave, [Tu Sigou] saw what was happening and was about to help, but unfortunately the thugs also arrived at the same time.
1:4:26|1:4:32|Huo Xiaolan, standing on the pillar in confusion, agilely jumps onto the beckoning Benben when she sees it.
1:4:34|1:4:49|With the three of them coming together, a new round of escape began. [Tu Sigou], who ran out of the alley first, happened to look up and noticed the hot air balloon suspended in the air, while on the other side, [Boss Zhu], determined to find [Huo Xiaolan], was packing his luggage.
1:6:0|1:6:14|Angry [Huo Xiaolan] pushed [Song Tianyin] away and left in a huff. Realizing he had said the wrong thing, [Song Tianyin] slapped himself on the mouth. After walking for a while in the middle of the night, angry [Huo Xiaolan] suddenly turned around and saw that [Song Tianyin] had not caught up.
1:6:14|1:6:27|[Huo Xiaolan] sighed and sat down on a withered tree stump, releasing the paper figures that had been hanging at her waist. The small paper figures popped out one by one, making a commotion, as [Huo Xiaolan] asked them with a hint of confusion.
1:6:56|1:7:8|The paper dolls were scared and covered their faces. After [Huo Xiaolan] left, [Song Tianyin] walked out of the room alone. Lost in thought, he leaned on the railing, pondering [Huo Xiaolan]'s words and remembering the mother and child Thorny Demons in the cage.
1:7:10|1:7:25|After a moment of contemplation, [Song Tianyin] looked up, and at that moment, his belief that humans and demons could not coexist was shaken. Late at night, on the hot air balloon, Huba lay asleep in [Tu Sigou]'s arms. [Tu Sigou] wiped away the drool from Huba's mouth and said,
1:7:42|1:7:47|Tu Sigou listened in silence, furrowing his brow, then comfortingly patted the little [Huo Ba] lying in his arms.
1:7:48|1:8:5|The thugs passing under the hot air balloon were still desperately searching, and Tu Sigou, who stuck his head out, helplessly said. After speaking, Tu Sigou pulled his head back and covered the two sleeping people with a blanket.
1:8:5|1:8:20|Later, [Tu Sigou] also leaned on [Tu Sigou]'s shoulder and fell asleep. [Tu Sigou], who was not asleep, slowly opened his eyes and looked at the silly person beside him. Finally, he divided the blanket and draped some over the silly person before falling asleep peacefully. And so, under the cover of night, [Tu Sigou], [Huo Xiaolan], and the silly person snuggled up together to sleep.
1:8:20|1:8:35|After a night of rushing around, they quickly entered the realm of dreams. As the hot air balloon moved slowly, the sleeping trio looked like a warm family. At the same time, the words of [Huo Xiaolan] kept lingering in [Song Tianyin]'s mind. Unable to sleep, [Song Tianyin] wrapped in a blanket, walked into the Monster-Seeking Pavilion.
1:8:38|1:8:56|After experiencing the magic of the Memory Dune during the day, the whimsical [Song Tianyin] walked around the disc and eventually sat on it. Moments later, the disc descended, and the Memory Dune was activated. Just like during the day, as the disc descended, a large amount of fine sand was spit out from the dragon's mouth directly in front.
1:8:56|1:9:3|The same fine sand rose into the air in succession, just as [Song Tianyin] watched with anticipation.
1:9:3|1:9:18|The fine sand did not transform into any shape, but suddenly collapsed and scattered back into the sand pool. Watching the scattered sand grains, [Song Tianyin], who seemed to know where the problem lay, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, adjusted his sitting posture, and tightly clenched his hands with a furrowed brow, as if his whole body was exerting itself in deep thought.
1:9:19|1:9:36|The feeling of missing in the Missed Sands was awakened once again, as the fine sand slowly rose into the air and gradually intertwined. In the blink of an eye, the outline of Hu Ba appeared, but as [Song Tianyin] watched the fine sand continue to change, it scattered back into the sand pool.
1:9:36|1:9:44|Tu Sigou, who had been failing repeatedly, sat dejectedly on the platform. Hearing footsteps, Tu Sigou turned around and saw Huo Xiaolan appearing behind him.
1:9:46|1:10:0|[Huo Xiaolan] reached out her hand to [Song Tianyin], who walked over holding a doll made by [Song Tianyin] in the shape of a Hu Ba. They smiled at each other as their eyes met. [Huo Xiaolan] looked at the doll in her hand for a moment, then said to [Song Tianyin].
1:10:2|1:10:12|After speaking, [Song Tianyin] leaned to the side. Behind him, [Huo Xiaolan] sat with one leg crossed over the other next to him, the two of them sitting side by side on the sand dune, closing their eyes and quietly picturing the appearance of Huba.
1:10:12|1:10:23|The fine sand that was spinning and rising emitted a golden light, shining brilliantly in the hall. The two slowly opened their eyes when they heard the movement of the fine sand, only to see the fine sand transforming into the appearance of Hu Ba.
1:10:23|1:10:30|Dancing in the air, their movements lifelike, tears in their eyes as they recall the happy times spent with [Huo Xiaolan].
1:10:31|1:10:47|Huo Xiaolan happily spits water towards Tu Sigou, the two of them coaxing Hu Ba to sleep and making him happy. These memories are vivid. Even the little paper man around Huo Xiaolan's waist emerges, quietly watching. The golden light keeps flashing from their faces, and the tears reflected in their eyes appear even more moving.
1:10:47|1:11:3|While the two were still watching the dancing, Huoba suddenly immersed in memories, the sand scattered, turning into the shape of a hot air balloon again. [Huo Xiaolan] looked at the familiar hot air balloon and said.
1:11:5|1:11:13|After learning about the location of Huba, the next morning the two of them set off, but before heading there they first went to the Demon-capturing Pavilion to retrieve their repaired weapons.
1:11:26|1:11:34|After kissing Song Tianyin, Huo Xiaolan ran inside and saw the host, who had been waiting for a long time, sitting on a wooden cart with his back to her. The host spoke after hearing the noise.
1:12:7|1:12:9|After the innkeeper finished speaking, Tu Sigou pulled down the prepared mechanism.
1:12:13|1:12:27|As the mechanism was triggered, two large cannons hidden behind the door simultaneously started, shooting a dense amount of popcorn into the air, slowly drifting down like snowflakes. And so, this romantic gesture resembling artificial snowfall was successfully carried out according to plan.
1:12:27|1:12:32|Although [Huo Xiaolan] fell for it, her attention was completely drawn to the popcorn falling in front of her.
1:12:33|1:12:47|Just as [Huo Xiaolan] was focused on watching, the pavilion owner opened the paper umbrella he had prepared in advance. Everything was going according to the pavilion owner's plan. He slowly approached [Huo Xiaolan] with the umbrella, getting closer and closer. Just as he was about to kiss [Huo Xiaolan], [Song Tianyin] burst in from the doorway.
1:12:47|1:12:52|Upon seeing [Song Tianyin], [Huo Xiaolan] quickly got up. The approaching innkeeper also missed a step and almost fell down.
1:13:19|1:13:27|Song Tianyin, who was standing aside, let go of his hand and said, then took out a small bucket that matched the wooden barrel.
1:13:28|1:13:37|The shopkeeper took a wooden bucket and placed a small bucket on top of it, demonstrating to the two of them.
1:13:58|1:14:12|In a hurry to leave, Tu Sigou and Huo Xiaolan quickly dealt with the pavilion master before turning and running. Watching their backs, the pavilion master muttered to himself in confusion. After bidding farewell to the pavilion master, the two of them rushed down the mountain from the Celestial Master's Hall and headed straight for the hot air balloon in the market.
1:14:15|1:14:30|Upon seeing the hot air balloon in the sky, [Huo Xiaolan] happily searched for a place to board. Just then, [Tu Sigou], who had just woken up, raised his head to observe the traces of the thugs below. After looking around and not finding any thugs, [Tu Sigou] woke up Benben and Huba to prepare to leave.
1:14:30|1:14:40|While [Huo Xiaolan] and [Song Tianyin] were still wandering around below, unsure of how to get up, [Tu Sigou] climbed down from the stage behind them along the railing.
1:14:42|1:14:53|After passing by each other like that, Benben also climbed down with Huba in his arms. When [Tu Sigou] and the others came down, they still cautiously peeked out first, looked around, and only dared to walk on the street after confirming that there were no thugs around.
1:15:6|1:15:15|Tu Sigou gave a glare at Benben and continued walking towards the small path. As Huo Xiaolan and Song Tianyin passed by one end of the corridor, Boss Zhu's group happened to sneakily walk past from the other end.
1:15:17|1:15:24|[Huo Xiaolan] caught a glimpse of a figure on the other side and then pulled [Song Tianyin] over in just a moment.
1:15:26|1:15:33|Huo Xiaolan, feeling a bit disheartened, asked Song Tianyin while glancing at Tu Sigou.
1:15:34|1:15:50|Soon after, Tu Sigou put the Hu Ba in his arms on the ground. The shy Hu Ba ran to the corner behind the pillar, seeming to take a long time to urinate after holding it in all night. To wait for Hu Ba, Benben and [Tu Sigou] sat tiredly on chairs. At this moment, [Huo Xiaolan] and [Song Tianyin] walked over.
1:15:50|1:16:5|The pillar in the corner blocked Hu Ba's view, so he didn't notice Huo Xiaolan, but Huo Xiaolan looked at Tu Sigou's face with a sense of familiarity, then walked past without paying much attention. Just as the two passed by Hu Ba, they walked out, and then Tu Sigou and his group walked in the opposite direction of Huo Xiaolan.
1:16:5|1:16:10|The two groups of people passed each other once again, going in opposite directions on the deserted street.
1:16:11|1:16:20|As they walked, Tu Sigou and [Huo Xiaolan] suddenly stopped in unison, as if they had a telepathic connection or their hearts resonated with each other, and they both turned around at the same time.
1:16:23|1:16:32|Seeing their long-lost loved ones right in front of them, they joyfully ran towards each other. Tu Sigou excitedly jumped on the two of them, coquettishly.
1:16:33|1:16:48|After enduring countless hardships and longing day and night, the family finally reunited. Tears of excitement streamed down [Song Tianyin]'s face. In that moment, [Huo Xiaolan] in his arms stopped playing around and a sense of longing mixed with grievance surged in her heart.
1:16:48|1:17:4|[Song Tianyin] watched as Huba cried, tears finally streaming down his own cheeks. Even Benben couldn't help but shed tears at this touching scene.
1:17:7|1:17:14|[Huo Xiaolan] took Huba and held it tightly in her arms, blaming herself.
1:17:31|1:17:44|Just as the family was enjoying the joy of reunion, [Tu Sigou] rushed over and snatched Huba away. Seeing Huba being taken away, the couple [Huo Xiaolan] hurried forward to fight for it, and little Huba was passed back and forth between [Tu Sigou] and Benben like a ball.
1:18:43|1:18:49|After hesitating for a moment, Tu Sigou looked at the Hu Ba in his hand and agreed without hesitation.
1:18:54|1:19:9|Shortly after, [Tu Sigou] carried Huba and followed [Huo Xiaolan] and her husband along with the casino thugs to the Tian Shi Tang. The group waited in the main hall of Tian Shi Tang, and when it was heard that Huba had been captured, all the Taoists of Tian Shi Tang rushed to the main hall under the leadership of [Yun Qing].
1:19:9|1:19:22|[Yun Qing] changed his usual appearance and was now dressed in a cloak with shoulder pads and armor, with two terrifying belts crisscrossing his chest. Emitting an aura of evil, [Yun Qing] approached [Tu Sigou], who was holding Hu Ba, and asked.
1:19:29|1:19:49|Yun Qing nodded after listening to the orders. His men brought out two boxes of silver ingots and placed them in front of Tu Sigou. Upon opening them, the boxes revealed neatly arranged shining silver ingots. Tu Sigou looked at them and then glanced at the baby in his arms.
1:19:49|1:19:55|After watching for a while, [Tu Sigou] finally handed Huba over to [Yun Qing], leaving Benben sighing sadly.
1:19:56|1:19:58|[Tu Sigou] picked up the box and walked towards the door.
1:20:8|1:20:25|He looked at the lost Benben with some astonishment. Although Benben turned his back, he still hoped Tu Sigou would stop him, but Tu Sigou remained silent for a long time before speaking to Benben.
1:20:30|1:20:43|After saying that, he left with the crowd's sighs. With tears in his eyes, [Huo Xiaolan] turned around and looked at the departing [Tu Sigou]. At that moment, [Huo Xiaolan] gratefully said to [Yun Qing].
1:20:52|1:21:0|Huo Xiaolan was knocked down by a palm strike.
1:21:3|1:21:17|Just as Huo Xiaolan and her husband were about to get up and chase after them, they were surrounded by Yun Qing's men. Several of them quickly formed a circle with their hands and threw specially made wooden sticks at their feet. In an instant, thick smoke enveloped the three of them, and when the smoke cleared, they had disappeared without a trace. Song Tianyin hurriedly said to Huo Xiaolan.
1:21:26|1:21:37|At this moment, [Tu Sigou] was still handing out money on the street. Upon hearing this news, the three children who had previously posted the notice also came aggressively to demand payment.
1:21:39|1:21:54|The three children happily walked away after receiving the three silver ingots from [Tu Sigou]. After paying off all the money owed to the people, [Tu Sigou] leaned against the cart in a daze.
1:21:55|1:22:2|After a deep sigh, he picked up the remaining silver ingots in the box and pondered.
1:22:14|1:22:23|On the other side, [Yun Qing] led Huba into the cave. Suddenly, Huba farted, and [Yun Qing] grabbed the grass on his head and asked.
1:22:35|1:22:40|Huo Xiaolan couldn't hold it in and peed all over Yun Qing.
1:22:48|1:23:14|On the other side in the demon realm, the couple [Huo Xiaolan] sat on a wooden cart borrowed from the innkeeper, with Benben pulling the cart frantically ahead. The two closed their eyes tightly as they raced along the rugged mountain road. Meanwhile, the innkeeper of the Celestial Master's Pavilion was eating popcorn alone.
1:23:17|1:23:21|The innkeeper, who has already fallen deeply in love, looked at the sky full of rice flowers and talked to the doll.
1:23:23|1:23:39|On the other side, after a period of rushing around, Benben brought the two to a cave in the mountains, where [Yun Qing] was washing clothes. After washing a few times and smelling a scent, he continued to scrub angrily, and then said to [Huo Xiaolan] next to him.
1:23:48|1:23:56|This is the entrance to the demon realm. After Benshen led the way through the narrow passage, they arrived at an open space and immediately saw [Huo Xiaolan].
1:25:1|1:25:17|While [Huo Xiaolan] was still in the air, the clumsy Benben grabbed [Huo Xiaolan] from the side, only to be forcefully pulled and slammed against the wall. As [Yun Qing] smugly looked at [Huo Xiaolan], she used a rope to yank herself out of Yun Qing's grasp. Seeing this, Yun Qing quickly tightened the rope in her hand, at this moment.
1:25:18|1:25:22|Tianyin is going to untie the rope on [Huo Xiaolan], and Yun Qing swings his arm, causing [Huo Xiaolan] to be lifted up along with the rope.
1:25:22|1:25:30|At this moment, [Song Tianyin] could only keep jumping up and down. Just as he was about to catch her, [Yun Qing] gave a strong swing, and [Huo Xiaolan] fell heavily on [Song Tianyin].
1:25:30|1:25:38|Tu Sigou then dragged [Huo Xiaolan] to the ground. Seeing the two of them fall, [Yun Qing] took the almost fainting Hu Ba towards the entrance of the demon realm, and the two hurriedly followed.
1:25:44|1:26:1|When they could run out of the cave, [Yun Qing] was nowhere to be seen. Just as the others were still in doubt, seven Taoists from the Tian Shi Tang walked out from a nearby small cave. [Huo Xiaolan] took two steps back in fear, only to see the seven people walking calmly in front of the two, then suddenly forming two rows and striking a monster pose.
1:26:14|1:26:26|Just as the monsters were approaching, [Huo Xiaolan] leaped up and fiercely knocked down the leading monster. [Huo Xiaolan] slid towards the center, buying time for [Song Tianyin] who was examining the weapon box.
1:26:26|1:26:34|One of the demons was about to pounce on Song Tianyin when Tu Sigou pressed down on the demon's fairy claw and said, "Don't be afraid." Startled, Song Tianyin quickly lowered his head to study it.
1:26:34|1:26:43|Just upgraded her magic weapon, [Huo Xiaolan] wielded the magic rope like a divine aid, facing multiple opponents without falling behind. Meanwhile, [Song Tianyin] successfully opened the weapon box on the side.
1:26:43|1:26:57|The paper dolls jumped in and put on very mini equipment after seeing it. On the other side, [Huo Xiaolan], who was still fighting hard, had just kicked away a monster when she was accidentally knocked into a cave by a monster from the side. Just as the monster was about to continue its attack, eight paper dolls flew towards it.
1:26:57|1:27:14|The inconspicuous little paper man, empowered by swords and knives, unexpectedly defeated the huge monster, leaving it in a sorry state. After providing the little paper man with a good weapon, [Song Tianyin] continued to study his own weapon. Meanwhile, Benben was still engaging in a battle of wits with the previous monster, buying time for [Song Tianyin], but progress on [Song Tianyin]'s side seemed to be less than smooth.
1:27:14|1:27:21|Confused, he fumbled with the weapon switch and hurried out of the cave after [Huo Xiaolan] took care of the last pregnant demon, searching for [Song Tianyin] and Bimbo.
1:27:21|1:27:29|Just as [Song Tianyin], who had just finished studying the weapons, met up with the clumsy [Huo Xiaolan], a dozen powerful blood demons flew in the sky.
1:27:30|1:27:38|[Huo Xiaolan] quickly jumped down from the edge of the cliff below, followed closely by Tu Sigou, and Song Tianyin, who was a bit slow, also jumped down at the last moment with weapons in hand.
1:27:46|1:27:55|The blood demons piled up one by one like a tower, and in the blink of an eye, about ten of them were pressed into the shape of a small mountain peak. After a moment, there was no movement.
1:27:58|1:28:9|Tu Sigou cautiously opened a gap and peeked through, only to see a laughing talisman flying in and sticking on its forehead. As it burst into laughter while holding its stomach, the pile of blood demons was pushed away one by one, revealing Huo Xiaolan and her husband standing up with weapons in hand.
1:28:10|1:28:20|At this moment, a large number of blood demons rushed towards them. Without time to speak, the two of them backed against each other and shot a large number of talismans in all directions at the blood demons. One itchy talisman shot onto the demon's forehead, causing the demon to frantically scratch its whole body.
1:28:22|1:28:35|Tu Sigou and Huo Xiaolan completely ignored attacking the two of them, instead changing directions accurately to shoot at the blood demon in the air. The immobilization spell caused them to fall straight down, while those affected by the laughter spell started laughing heartily in the air.
1:28:43|1:29:1|Seeing the situation turning bad, [Yun Qing] mounted the huge four-winged demon and prepared to escape. The two of them shot talismans at the blood demons coming towards them while fleeing. When [Song Tianyin] saw that he was about to lose track of [Yun Qing], he prepared to drive towards her, but just as he aimed the launcher, he was whipped to the ground.
1:29:1|1:29:10|At this moment, [Huo Xiaolan] was jumping on the back of a blood demon with a rope, tying up the feet of [Yun Qing]'s mount. However, the massive mount was not greatly affected by this, but instead dragged [Huo Xiaolan] forward as well.
1:29:15|1:29:25|After that, [Song Tianyin] and [Tu Sigou] also quickly jumped up from the nearby high ground. Even so, it did not affect the speed of the mounts flying, continuing to drag them between the towering cliffs.
1:29:25|1:29:32|Seeing that they couldn't shake off the pursuers, the mount suddenly flew vertically into the air, continued flying for dozens of meters, then suddenly changed direction and flew straight down.
1:29:34|1:29:53|[Song Tianyin], who was in danger himself, shouted at [Boss Zhu]. With lightning speed, [Boss Zhu]'s mouth was blown out of shape. Just as they were about to land, [Yun Qing] suddenly pulled the rope around the neck of the mount and entered into a level flight again. Seeing that they hadn't shaken off their pursuers yet, they flew towards a narrow valley.
1:29:53|1:30:3|The back and forth shaking caused Tu Sigou to accidentally drop the sword. Fortunately, Boss Zhu behind him reacted quickly, grabbing the sword with his foot, and then he proudly started playing with it.
1:30:6|1:30:19|But with one careless move, the sword fell into the abyss. As they were about to pass a mountain peak, Tu Sigou reacted quickly and grabbed onto the mountain. Huo Xiaolan quickly let go of the rope, ending the forced flight. At that moment, Yun Qing's hand slipped, and Huba plummeted into the abyss.
1:30:20|1:30:35|Under the pull of the law rope, Yongqing's human skin was also torn off, revealing his monster true form. Unexpectedly, he turned out to be the demon king's envoy, Chi Tianba. Enraged, Chi Tianba pushed his mount towards the peak where [Huo Xiaolan] was located. As the peak shook violently, several people couldn't stand firm and fell off the cliff together.
1:30:45|1:30:50|Facing the terrifying Chi Tianba, [Huo Xiaolan] bravely took out the law rope, as soon as she finished speaking.
1:30:51|1:31:1|[Huo Xiaolan] used a rope to tie up Tu Sigou's hands, but the powerful Tu Sigou easily threw [Huo Xiaolan] against the wall with a lift of his hand. After kicking [Huo Xiaolan] away, just as he was about to launch an attack on the fallen [Huo Xiaolan], a spell was uttered.
1:31:3|1:31:24|Song Tianyin used telekinesis to throw a large rock at Tu Sigou. Just as Huo Xiaolan tried to snatch the tiger skin from behind, Tu Sigou dodged and Huo Xiaolan fell to the ground. Angered, Tu Sigou released a large amount of poisonous gas from the hole behind him, causing everyone to cover their mouths and noses with their sleeves. Just as they were about to faint, a group of little demon wings fanned away the thick fog.
1:31:24|1:31:30|The person who sat on the monster immediately snatched Huba away. When Chi Tianba took a closer look, he realized that the person was [Tu Sigou].
1:31:47|1:31:58|After listening, the little monster hidden in the colored cup crawled under [Tu Sigou] and stuck its head into the monster's mouth. After jumping down, [Tu Sigou] returned the sword he had picked up to [Song Tianyin].
1:32:16|1:32:28|Tu Sigou released more poison gas with all his might. At this moment, Benshan, who came up with an idea, said to the little monster woman.
1:32:30|1:32:38|The flower on Tu Sigou's head slowly opened its petals, and Tu Sigou sprinkled the nectar all the way into the hole where Boss Zhu was spraying poison gas.
1:32:39|1:32:47|Before the group of people covering their noses could react, a swarm of bees caught the scent and flew over.
1:32:48|1:33:2|At this time, the small paper men around Xiaolan also jumped out. They held weapons and rode on bees, landing on Tu Sigou's back like celestial warriors. The small paper men each had their own clear division of labor, drilling into the holes behind [Tu Sigou]'s back. Before long, everyone saw the poisonous gas slowly dissipating.
1:33:2|1:33:16|Just now the mighty [Scarlet Sky Tyrant] is now struggling in pain on the ground. Despite his large size, facing such a small creature, he has no way to resist and can only let it have its way. After Bubu returns to the group, [Tu Sigou] teases.
1:33:25|1:33:27|The group of people who were about to leave turned back to look when they heard the noise.
1:33:28|1:33:38|The dying Tu Sigou crawled to his mount, opened his mouth wide, and slowly swallowed it whole. After devouring it completely, a gas expelled the paper man and the bees from his orifices.
1:33:39|1:33:42|As the mount was rapidly digested inside, the size of [Chi Tianba] also increased several times larger than before.
1:33:53|1:33:59|At this moment, [Huo Xiaolan] fearlessly walked towards [Chi Tianba], who was seen stuffing small stones along the way into its mouth.
1:34:2|1:34:8|Huo Xiaolan pouted and forcefully spat the pebble in her mouth towards Tu Sigou.
1:34:11|1:34:24|Huo Xiaolan's attacks proved ineffective, Tu Sigou quickly stepped forward to carry Hu Ba away, Song Tianyin brandished his sword and questioned, unwilling to waste words, Chi Tianba raised his hand and struck towards everyone.
1:34:26|1:34:35|Several people dodged the attacks swiftly, but they were also forced into a corner. They only knew how to evade, unaware that they were heading towards a cliff. The people at the edge of the cliff looked on fearfully at Tu Sigou.
1:34:35|1:34:52|The fist smashed heavily on the ground, causing the weakest part of the cliff edge to break, and everyone fell down together. Chi Tianba stuck his head out to look down and found that several people did not fall to the bottom of the cliff, but were just at the fractured area below. [Tu Sigou] and others were all safe and sound, only the fat and clumsy one fell at the edge of the cliff.
1:34:52|1:34:59|The three of them then worked together to pull up [Benben]. Just then, a big hand from Chi Tianba swung over.
1:35:34|1:35:46|Huo Xiaolan instructed Boss Hu before returning to the bottom of the cliff with Song Tianyin and Tu Sigou. Facing the huge Red Sky Overlord, the four of them showed no fear this time. They acted according to the plan and ran towards the four sides of the Red Sky Overlord.
1:35:46|1:35:53|[Tu Sigou] hid in a cave with Benben, waiting for an opportunity. Seeing Chitian Ba chasing after [Boss Zhu], [Huo Xiaolan] used a rope to tie up its arms.
1:35:55|1:36:5|On the side, [Song Tianyin] was also chanting spells, controlling the sword to constantly interfere. At this moment, [Tu Sigou] ran out and shouted loudly, causing Benben to decisively lie down on the ground.
1:36:8|1:36:16|[Tu Sigou] held Huba, using his clumsy big belly as a springboard, flew in front of Chitian Ba, who felt insulted by being spat on, and angrily attacked everyone.
1:36:16|1:36:28|After knocking down several people with just a few moves, Chi Tianba reached out and grabbed Hu Ba who was standing. When everyone saw Hu Ba being tightly held by Chi Tianba's big hand, they all rushed towards Chi Tianba without hesitation.
1:36:29|1:36:34|[Tu Sigou] and Benben were desperately hitting at the feet of Chitianba, but Chitianba didn't feel any pain at all.
1:36:36|1:36:41|Desperate to save Hu Ba, [Huo Xiaolan] once again tied Chi Tianba's hands with a rope, prompting [Song Tianyin] to think of making the sword bigger in a moment of urgency.
1:36:43|1:36:52|As soon as the spell was cast, [Huo Xiaolan] was thrown towards the cliff.
1:36:54|1:37:4|At this moment, the sword also shrank to the size of a person. Even when Huo Xiaolan was about to fall, Song Tianyin stepped on the flying sword and caught her steadily. Meanwhile, Yun Qing was still continuously hitting the clumsy and Tu Sigou was caught in the hand of the Red Sky Tyrant.
1:37:4|1:37:18|The couple [Huo Xiaolan] standing on the sword had just adjusted their position and were ready to launch an attack when suddenly, a tail from the Red Sky Tyrant caught them off guard, throwing them off the ship. Fortunately, [Song Tianyin] was skilled in magic, and he used his mind to control the sword and catch the two of them.
1:37:19|1:37:28|The two, Tu Sigou and Huo Xiaolan, who had just stepped on the sword, agilely dodged the palm of Chitian Ba flying towards the cave, and then shouted towards Huba after flying out again.
1:37:40|1:37:54|Shortly afterwards, the sword, under the control of [Song Tianyin], flew straight towards the head of Chitian Ba. Just as it was about to collide, Huba stopped yelling. [Huo Xiaolan] and [Song Tianyin], who could see it, quickly jumped to the side. However, Chitian Ba, who was unable to react in time, was pierced through the head by the swiftly approaching sword.
1:37:54|1:38:3|Soon after, Benben and [Tu Sigou] were also thrown to the ground. Just as everyone reacted, they saw the massive Chitian Ba slowly moving towards Huba.
1:38:5|1:38:20|At the critical moment, [Huo Xiaolan] throws the rope towards Huba. However, when she pulls it back, there is no sign of Huba, leaving [Tu Sigou] to collapse and hammer the ground in despair.
1:38:21|1:38:49|Everyone thought that Hu Ba would always fall under the body of Chi Tianba, but at this moment, there was a connection between [Song Tianyin] and the sword. Hu Ba was seen sitting on the sword, flying back towards everyone with a happy face. [Huo Xiaolan] hurriedly held Hu Ba in her arms, while worried [Song Tianyin] said.
1:38:49|1:39:12|Huo Ba once again leaned against [Huo Xiaolan] in her arms. As the sun gradually set, the group of people arrived in front of the body of Chi Tianba. They did not celebrate happily at the sight of his body, but instead fell into a collective silence. After a while, [Song Tianyin] found the skin that Chi Tianba was wearing. He folded it and placed it in the sunlight, sighing.
1:40:34|1:40:41|Beng Beng and Hu Ba were both filled with tears, looking at each other, and Beng Beng couldn't help but sob a few times.
1:40:44|1:40:57|Shortly after, [Huo Xiaolan] and her husband held Huba and prepared to leave, with Huba waving goodbye to [Tu Sigou] and Benben in the middle. After Huba's family walked away, Benben looked at the tearful [Tu Sigou] and said,
1:41:12|1:41:18|Recalling the events of today, [Song Tianyin] asked with a hint of confusion.
1:41:37|1:41:45|After a moment of happy playfulness, [Song Tianyin] put his arms around [Huo Xiaolan] and Huba, and said.
1:41:56|1:42:4|Tu Sigou, who lingered on the ground with Benben, watched the sunset and said to Benben.
