0:2:22|0:2:31|The setting sun shines on the Great Wall, with [Liang Xiaoxiao] leaning against the wall and [Qin Fen] kneeling on one knee holding a diamond ring.
0:3:54|0:3:57|After speaking, he also kissed the hand of [Liang Xiaoxiao].
0:3:58|0:4:8|The two of them proposed on the Great Wall at sunset, but whether the proposal was accepted or not remains uncertain. The love and hatred between them has just begun.
0:4:9|0:4:24|The pond was full of vitality after the rain, with lotus leaves covering the surface. This secluded park was going to be lively today because of a ceremony. A convertible black car hurriedly drove by, the flowers on the car were hard to ignore.
0:4:24|0:4:34|The clattering of hooves on the cement road was crisp and attention-grabbing. And it didn't stop there, several low-key black sedans followed behind.
0:4:35|0:4:49|They were all heading towards one direction, the scene of the ceremony. Two tall horses were pulling a European-style carriage, with the two rare beauties sitting in the luxurious carriage behind the coachman.
0:4:49|0:5:6|The exquisitely elegant attire, complemented by the charming faces of [Mango] and [Liang Xiaoxiao], the two of them in long dresses, headpieces, and even veils. The coachman drove the carriage over the small bridge and soon arrived at the ceremony venue. In front of the European-style building, welcoming the guests was a woman in a tulle skirt and a floral wreath on her head.
0:5:6|0:5:17|There is also a man in a full black suit. They look solemn, waiting for the arrival of the guests. The carriage slowly stops, and the bell in the box rings, as if announcing the protagonist of today.
0:5:17|0:5:32|The man with a beard and crew cut who is about to appear is [Li Xiangshan]. He strides forward, opens the car door, and gallantly helps [Mango] out of the carriage. Following them, [Liang Xiaoxiao] lifts her long skirt and is assisted down by the coachman. The two hosts walk side by side with [Liang Xiaoxiao].
0:5:32|0:5:47|Three people walked behind, with [Mango] holding hands with [Li Xiangshan] in front. Amidst the music, they entered this European-style building. The backyard was full of guests, with [Qin Fen] as the host.
0:6:1|0:6:12|The symphony plays as the guests in the audience look towards the other end of the carpet. In the spotlight, [Mango] walks towards the stage arm in arm with [Li Xiangshan], followed by [Liang Xiaoxiao] and her female companion.
0:6:12|0:6:27|[Li Xiangshan] squinted his eyes, looking serious, while [Mango] remained solemn as well. The shiny leather shoes and long skirts moved forward, their steps on the carpet following the music. Soon, they arrived at the front of the stage, unfolding this unique divorce ceremony.
0:6:27|0:6:35|On stage, [Qin Fen] watched as they approached, then turned to the band and waved in greeting.
0:6:36|0:6:43|Li Xiangshan and Mango stand on the left and right of Qin Fen, while Liang Xiaoxiao stands next to Mango.
0:6:59|0:7:6|[Qin Fen]'s quirky speech amused the guests present.
0:7:51|0:8:5|Mango glanced sideways at Li Xiangshan expressionlessly, and the two quickly took off their rings as if afraid of being late, this marriage is about to end.
0:8:30|0:8:44|[Qin Fen] raised a large red "double happiness" symbol, and they each held a knife to cut it open. [Qin Fen] placed the cut "double happiness" in a copper basin and lit it on fire. The flames quickly consumed the paper symbol, as [Qin Fen] continued speaking.
0:8:46|0:8:48|He finished speaking and looked at [Mango], then turned to look at [Li Xiangshan],
0:8:50|0:9:2|[Mango] and [Li Xiangshan] shook hands on stage, amidst the cheers of the crowd, [Li Xiangshan] grabbed [Mango] and embraced her.
0:9:8|0:9:26|The atmosphere on the scene was particularly lively, as if this love funeral was a comedy in their eyes. The passionate symphony accompanied by applause, the ceremony was basically over. The cocktail party is about to begin, with [Li Xiangshan] holding [Mango]'s hand to cut the cake.
0:9:28|0:9:42|The two of them together raised a bottle of wine and poured champagne. The pigeons flew into the air, and [Qin Fen] started playing with balloons again.
0:9:45|0:9:50|Liang Xiaoxiao looked at Xuanxuan and felt that there seemed to be a hint of admiration for Qin Fen in her eyes.
0:9:56|0:10:4|[Qin Fen] gave a thumbs up to Xuan Xuan, who playfully stuck out her tongue at him. Back on stage, [Qin Fen] didn't notice the sharp gaze from [Liang Xiaoxiao].
0:13:4|0:13:23|The car door is closed, and the car drives away slowly. The night falls quietly on this city, the streets are still bustling, and the lights are still bright. The world will not stop for anyone's joy or sorrow, but joy and sorrow can suffocate people. The end of a relationship, even with a decent ceremony, cannot disguise its tragedy.
0:13:23|0:13:29|Under the streetlight, the RV drove towards home. Inside the car, [Liang Xiaoxiao] yawned.
0:13:31|0:13:49|[Qin Fen] gave a wry smile, [Liang Xiaoxiao] raised her hand to show off the ring, while [Mango] carefully examined it while holding [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s hand, as if afraid her good friend would be deceived.
0:14:15|0:14:21|[Qin Fen] licked his lips and turned around, saying,
0:14:28|0:14:43|[Mango] was amused by [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s words and the two women laughed freely in the back seat. [Liang Xiaoxiao] was actually a flight attendant. On this day, the flight was heading from Beijing to Sanya Airport, and [Liang Xiaoxiao] as usual, went to the first class cabin.
0:14:43|0:14:55|She approached a man who was having Western food, holding a bottle of red wine in each hand. She asked the fashionable man who was reading a fashion magazine with an elegant and decent appearance.
0:14:56|0:15:7|In the second inquiry from [Liang Xiaoxiao], he finally took his eyes off the magazine. The man looked up along the wine bottle, admiring the exquisite beauty of [Liang Xiaoxiao].
0:15:9|0:15:18|[Liang Xiaoxiao] stood still in front of him. He first put away the fork, stood up, walked around [Liang Xiaoxiao], opened the high-end leather suitcase next to him, inside of which was a crown adorned with jewels. He pulled out the bottom layer, and...
0:15:18|0:15:30|It is a pair of exaggerated earrings. He carefully put them on [Liang Xiaoxiao], then gently flicked the gemstone earrings hanging on [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s ears. And that's not all, he then took out the beautiful crown and dazzling.
0:15:30|0:15:36|The necklace is put on [Liang Xiaoxiao] one by one. Women are naturally irresistible to jewelry.
0:15:57|0:16:3|[Liang Xiaoxiao] said shyly. Soon the flight arrived in Sanya, and with the roar of the plane, [Liang Xiaoxiao] reached the destination of this trip.
0:16:11|0:16:20|As the plane slowly came to a stop on the runway, the tropical vibe was already in the air. The scorching sun beat down on the land, and the airport's unique giant pineapple exuded warmth towards the visitors.
0:16:20|0:16:35|Flight attendant [Liang Xiaoxiao] is familiar with all this, but what makes her feel unfamiliar is this trial marriage journey. On the plane, [Liang Xiaoxiao] unbuckles her seatbelt, looks outside, and then stands up to get off the plane. But when passing by a flirtatious man, he strikes up a conversation.
0:16:37|0:16:45|[Liang Xiaoxiao] nodded slightly and then walked past him off the plane. Not far away, a man wearing a duckbill cap walked over and handcuffed the sissy, with the other end of the handcuffs
0:16:45|0:16:57|Locked the high-end leather suitcase. The airplane door opened, with ground security guards holding guns and an armored vehicle parked nearby. A flamboyant man effortlessly carried the suitcase onto the vehicle, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] witnessed it all.
0:16:57|0:17:20|At noon in the airport lobby, the crowd was bustling, and a wooden airplane hung from the ceiling, as if announcing the charm of the tourist city to the visitors. The roof, made of neatly arranged wooden strips, had a unique summer flavor. [Liang Xiaoxiao] walked out in a uniform, showing off her well-proportioned figure.
0:17:37|0:17:43|Seeing [Qin Fen], [Liang Xiaoxiao] walking towards him with a phone in hand, even hiding behind the wall giggling, sneaking a glance at [Qin Fen].
0:17:43|0:17:56|The silly [Qin Fen] was still searching in the crowd, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] had already changed out of her uniform in the restroom. As she walked out of the cubicle, she tidied her hair and walked towards the mirror. She casually placed the discarded clothes on the nearby suitcase.
0:18:24|0:18:33|The phone on the table kept ringing, but [Liang Xiaoxiao] ignored it. At that moment, a waiter brought a cup of coffee and placed it in front of [Liang Xiaoxiao].
0:18:35|0:18:51|The phone rang, but [Liang Xiaoxiao] calmly picked up her coffee, while [Qin Fen] in the hall looked flustered at the sparse crowd. Setting down her coffee, [Liang Xiaoxiao] peered through the potted plant and smiled as she answered the phone.
0:19:18|0:19:30|In the hall, [Qin Fen] on the phone suddenly caught sight of [Liang Xiaoxiao] behind the potted plant. He wasn't sure, just turned his head and walked slowly towards the back of the hall. [Liang Xiaoxiao], on the other hand, happily put down her phone, picked up the book in her arms, and started reading it with relish.
0:19:31|0:19:52|[Qin Fen] figured out the whole farce and walked over with a bouquet of flowers. [Liang Xiaoxiao] closed the book in dissatisfaction and glared at [Qin Fen] with a displeased expression. After all, they were going to be husband and wife, so they didn't make a fuss about it immediately. On both sides of the road to Yalong Bay, there was lush greenery, and the sunlight filtered through the coconut trees.
0:19:52|0:20:14|An SUV speeds through the shade of trees, with [Qin Fen] behind the wheel and [Liang Xiaoxiao] in the passenger seat. [Qin Fen] drives attentively with sunglasses on, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] pouts and remains upset about something that happened earlier. Glancing at [Liang Xiaoxiao], [Qin Fen] decides to break the silence.
0:21:39|0:21:44|[Liang Xiaoxiao] smiled confidently, while [Qin Fen] glanced sideways.
0:21:57|0:22:17|[Liang Xiaoxiao] immediately slapped [Qin Fen] on the shoulder, looking at his fearful expression. [Liang Xiaoxiao] couldn't help but smile. She flipped her hair and looked out the window. As [Qin Fen] leaned in to look at her expression, [Liang Xiaoxiao] pretended to push him away in mock anger.
0:22:17|0:22:32|[Qin Fen] held [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s hand and kissed her, but [Liang Xiaoxiao] wiped the saliva from the back of her hand on [Qin Fen] in disgust. Yalong Bay is a famous seaside resort, facing the sea and backed by green hills. The tropical climate all year round gives this place a vibrant atmosphere.
0:22:32|0:22:48|On the winding mountain road, a car slowly approaches, with dense trees on both sides adding a lot of beauty to the scenery. Far away from the bustling streets, this secluded paradise is indeed more suitable for living.
0:22:49|0:23:6|The setting sun shines through the trees onto the road, making everything here seem poetic. [Liang Xiaoxiao] looks at [Qin Fen] with a bright smile, and their wonderful pre-marriage journey begins. The car carries their longing for love, while the winding mountain road symbolizes the magic in their relationship.
0:23:8|0:23:22|Driving along, [Qin Fen] was not bored at all. He would occasionally hold hands with [Liang Xiaoxiao] and kiss her. [Liang Xiaoxiao] would squint her eyes, letting the afternoon sun shine on her delicate eyes, enjoying the warmth.
0:23:22|0:23:36|After a few hours' drive, they arrived at Yalong Bay, but there was still a distance to walk to their accommodation. The narrow wooden ladder could not accommodate a large vehicle like a car, so the two of them had to carry their suitcases and walk over. Before long, they arrived at their accommodation.
0:23:36|0:23:49|The wooden stairs exude a primitive cleanliness, [Liang Xiaoxiao] follows the pace of [Qin Fen] quickly descending, not even having time to glance around at the beautiful scenery. Arriving at the residence, there is also the same wooden railing.
0:23:49|0:23:58|The two walked through the corridor and arrived at their long-awaited residence. The waiter arranged the shoe cabinet at the entrance, while [Qin Fen] quickly stepped forward, took out the key, and opened the door.
0:23:59|0:24:6|[Liang Xiaoxiao] finally stopped to admire this ancient and picturesque house.
0:24:7|0:24:14|[Qin Fen] stuffed his luggage through the door, greeted [Liang Xiaoxiao] at the entrance, and was amazed by the decoration inside the house.
0:24:14|0:24:33|The wooden walls gleamed, with cages hanging from them containing unidentifiable birds. Ancient paintings were framed all over the walls. Passing through the entrance, the interior was filled with a strong Nordic atmosphere: a huge minimalist sofa, various walnut tables, chairs, and cabinets, and a bookshelf in the corner packed with books.
0:24:33|0:24:50|All of this made [Liang Xiaoxiao] look at [Qin Fen] in a new light. She admired [Qin Fen], casually placed her handbag on the sofa, and walked towards the window holding the pot of flowers. Excitedly, she arrived at the window, leaned out with her arms and looked outside. Outside the window were green mountains and the sea, giving a sense of being detached from the world.
0:24:50|0:24:53|[Qin Fen] walked past the sofa and approached the bathtub on the balcony,
0:24:58|0:25:15|He turned on the faucet, cleaning the bathtub. Hearing the noise, Liang Xiaoxiao walked over. Liang Xiaoxiao lightly kicked Qin Fen, who turned around and solemnly said,
0:25:53|0:26:2|[Liang Xiaoxiao] propped up her head, smiling at [Qin Fen]. After speaking, she put her arm around [Qin Fen] and rested her head on his shoulder.
0:26:10|0:26:19|After finishing speaking, she stood up to go change clothes. The packed suitcase was meticulously prepared by [Liang Xiaoxiao] this time. At that moment, [Qin Fen] walked over to look at her.
0:26:29|0:26:35|Qin Fen took off his shoes and sat down next to Liang Xiaoxiao.
0:26:42|0:26:56|Liang Xiaoxiao pushed Qin Fen out of the room from behind and closed the door. In the evening, with colorful clouds hanging on the horizon, the two of them sat by the spacious swimming pool, soaking their feet.
0:27:22|0:27:28|[Qin Fen] did not answer immediately, took a sip of beer in his hand.
0:28:12|0:28:23|Going down the stairs, there are more stairs to go up in front of me.
0:28:43|0:28:57|Halfway up the stairs, [Qin Fen] almost fell again. Inside the room, [Liang Xiaoxiao] was tidying up the bed, while [Qin Fen] was adjusting the window support pole. He shouted in pain, pretending to be injured.
0:29:23|0:29:35|[Liang Xiaoxiao] didn't dare to delay, quickly followed suit, pressing both palms against [Qin Fen]'s waist, giving a displeased look at the CD and walked over.
0:29:37|0:29:49|The door opened, and Qin Fen came with a new request. Liang Xiaoxiao, considering his injury, complied.
0:30:7|0:30:15|[Liang Xiaoxiao] was fooled and stunned. Without much thought, she lifted her veil and rode on [Qin Fen].
0:30:25|0:30:34|Liang Xiaoxiao feels the taste of being a devoted couple.
0:30:44|0:30:49|[Liang Xiaoxiao] is massaging him on his legs over and over again.
0:30:58|0:31:10|Seeing no movement from [Qin Fen] for a while, [Liang Xiaoxiao] stopped her actions and leaned forward to look at [Qin Fen]. She went to the bathroom to wash her hands, rubbing the soap on her face with a displeased expression, knowing that she had been deceived.
0:31:11|0:31:23|The taste of being a couple in adversity is completely gone. Knowing that [Qin Fen] has fallen asleep, [Liang Xiaoxiao] finally lies comfortably in the bathtub soaking in a bath. As night falls, the lights illuminate the bustling crowd.
0:31:23|0:31:41|In the room, the old-fashioned fan kept spinning, gently blowing the bed curtains. [Qin Fen] hadn't even taken off his clothes, lying on the bed sound asleep, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] lay beside him watching. Perhaps from lying down for too long, [Qin Fen] unconsciously turned over, and happened to open his eyes to see [Liang Xiaoxiao] staring at him.
0:31:41|0:32:2|He hesitated for a moment, then quickly looked up at [Liang Xiaoxiao]. Faced with [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s questioning, [Qin Fen] chose to ignore it and continued sleeping, even reaching out groggily to embrace [Liang Xiaoxiao]. [Liang Xiaoxiao] pushed him away, and [Qin Fen] leaned in closer.
0:32:8|0:32:25|[Liang Xiaoxiao] turned over, with her back to [Qin Fen]. [Qin Fen] pulled [Liang Xiaoxiao] back, but she held onto the edge of the bed tightly, the two of them struggling. Suddenly, [Qin Fen] let go, [Liang Xiaoxiao] couldn't stop and fell off the bed. Feeling upset, [Liang Xiaoxiao] grabbed a pillow and blanket and went to the living room.
0:32:36|0:32:46|[Qin Fen] intercepted [Liang Xiaoxiao] as she walked towards the room, pressed her onto the sofa, and sat on the coffee table. Speaking in a knowing tone, [Qin Fen] said,
0:34:40|0:34:48|Leave [Qin Fen] on the sofa. The next morning, a young man with a folding wheelchair arrived at the door, supporting the wheelchair with one hand and pressing the doorbell with the other.
0:34:49|0:34:55|In the room, [Liang Xiaoxiao] was comfortably lying on the bed sleeping, but the annoying doorbell didn't want to let her rest.
0:34:56|0:35:5|Liang Xiaoxiao, who was disturbed from her peaceful dream, frowned and got up. She walked barefoot towards the door, and in her nightgown, she blinked her eyes and opened the door.
0:35:6|0:35:15|The young man politely explained his intentions, and [Liang Xiaoxiao] was completely caught off guard, and dared not believe it.
0:35:18|0:35:30|[Liang Xiaoxiao] paused for a moment, looked into the room, and then walked towards it with a puzzled expression. After scanning around, she didn't see [Qin Fen] on the sofa, so she took a few steps forward and spotted [Qin Fen] on a chair.
0:35:34|0:35:49|As she spoke, she lifted her foot and stepped on the recliner. Hearing this, [Liang Xiaoxiao] looked displeased, realizing immediately that [Qin Fen] was retaliating against her.
0:36:38|0:36:46|After closing the door, [Liang Xiaoxiao] went straight to the bathroom, struggling early in the morning. When [Qin Fen] heard the sound,
0:36:54|0:37:2|On a rainy day, a warship is docked at the pier, with the navy troops on shore standing in neat formation. [Liang Xiaoxiao] and [Mango] look up at the navy troops coming ashore.
0:37:3|0:37:16|[Mango] took the binoculars and looked towards the navy, [Liang Xiaoxiao] cast a disdainful glance at [Mango]. The whistle blew, and the navy was about to set sail.
0:37:25|0:37:39|The music played as two navy officers jogged onto the deck. One of them stood tall and gazed reluctantly at [Mango]. The soldiers on the dock came forward to untie the ropes. With the sound of the horn, the families on the dock waved goodbye to the departing ship.
0:37:39|0:37:49|[Mango] still held the binoculars reluctantly, staring at the handsome face of the naval officer. The ship's chimney emitted black smoke, and [Mango] watched as her beloved was about to sail away, unable to help but cover her mouth.
0:37:49|0:38:4|Crying, [Liang Xiaoxiao] looked at [Mango] with a comforting expression. The ship sped up and left the dock amidst joyful music. Afterwards, [Liang Xiaoxiao] drove with [Mango] towards Yalong Bay.
0:38:33|0:38:50|Inside the villa in Yalong Bay, [Qin Fen] was sitting on the balcony with his legs crossed, eating an apple. The small table in front of him was covered with fruit peels. Upon hearing footsteps, [Qin Fen] quickly changed his posture to pretend to be sick. The person who came was [Mango], she covered [Qin Fen]'s eyes from behind and kissed his bald head.
0:39:15|0:39:22|Mango approached, not believing, and took a sniff.
0:39:32|0:39:39|Saying that, [Liang Xiaoxiao] squatted down and started cleaning up the fruit peels on the table.
0:39:41|0:39:46|[Qin Fen] pretended to be asleep with a dead pig not afraid of boiling water, lowering his head and squinting his eyes.
0:39:51|0:39:56|[Qin Fen] glanced at the door where [Liang Xiaoxiao] was taking out the trash.
0:41:3|0:41:11|[Qin Fen] is full of anger. He hands the peeled mango to [Mango], who turns her head away.
0:41:34|0:41:47|[Qin Fen] handed the teacup to [Mango], who got up to pour the tea. Sitting in the wheelchair, [Qin Fen] took a big bite out of [Mango], enjoying the food immensely.
0:42:9|0:42:14|[Liang Xiaoxiao] handed the teacup to [Mango] as she spoke.
0:42:52|0:42:57|The car slowly stopped in front of a luxury hotel, and the staff approached to open the door.
0:43:12|0:43:24|The luxurious decoration in the hotel exudes a sense of luxury, with the trendy and sexy two girlfriends chatting and laughing in front, followed by [Qin Fen] in a wheelchair. He lowers his hat, crosses his legs, and
0:43:24|0:43:34|Sitting happily in the wheelchair, [Qin Fen] almost got thrown out when the wheelchair got stuck on a step unnoticed by the staff. The two girlfriends glanced back but didn't pay any attention.
0:43:34|0:43:49|In the tropical-themed hotel, there were no private rooms, only wooden parasols under which small tables could accommodate three to five people for dining. The three of them chose a small table and sat down, as a waiter approached with the menu.
0:43:52|0:44:6|[Liang Xiaoxiao] took the menu and looked at [Qin Fen], asking if he was going to fully embody the identity of the old man.
0:44:42|0:44:52|[Liang Xiaoxiao] was not polite to [Qin Fen], but [Qin Fen] was quite easy-going, showing his front teeth in a smile. [Liang Xiaoxiao] noticed a familiar figure waving at her. [Qin Fen] was surprised and turned to look.
0:44:56|0:45:8|The other party greeted, [Liang Xiaoxiao] immediately stood up, while [Qin Fen] looked puzzled, feeling a bit uncomfortable. Just as [Liang Xiaoxiao] walked down the steps, the other party opened a sun umbrella and approached to shade her, while [Mango] pulled [Qin Fen] away.
0:46:19|0:46:29|Qin Fen was feeling extremely jealous, almost rushing over. Seeing the dishes being served but the person not arriving yet, Qin Fen spun his wheelchair.
0:46:30|0:46:34|He turned the wheels and came to the steps, where the staff hurried forward to assist.
0:46:35|0:46:41|[Qin Fen] stared straight at the table, then got up and walked past the staff towards [Liang Xiaoxiao].
0:47:4|0:47:13|[Qin Fen] leaned in closer, staring with a puzzled expression, "I don't have any impression at all."
0:47:16|0:47:28|[Qin Fen] frowned and said somewhat discontentedly, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] finished taking photos and got up to leave.
0:47:48|0:48:5|[Liang Xiaoxiao] pressed the fire and said, the waiter removed the encirclement, and the beef was placed in front of [Qin Fen], who remained silent.
0:48:6|0:48:15|Watching [Liang Xiaoxiao] getting angry, [Qin Fen] didn't dare to provoke her further. He picked up his knife and fork, intending to focus on eating the steak.
0:49:5|0:49:16|On the side, [Liang Xiaoxiao] couldn't bear to listen any longer, after all, she really wanted to go. Just then, the phone rang and [Liang Xiaoxiao] picked it up.
0:49:22|0:49:39|[Qin Fen] had no good feelings towards these people. What should have been a pleasant dinner ended in this way, with [Liang Xiaoxiao] in a long dress leaning on the sink in the bathroom, looking like she had just cried.
0:50:20|0:50:32|[Qin Fen] sends [Mango] forward, and the staff opens the car door. On the other side, [Liang Xiaoxiao] is wearing a coat, arms crossed in front of her chest, walking slowly.
0:50:34|0:50:52|[Qin Fen] grabbed the keys, pushed the wheelchair towards the parking lot, and took this opportunity to ease [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s emotions. After all, the emotional outburst was only temporary, deep down, both of them took each other very seriously. Back at home, [Liang Xiaoxiao] picked out a few dresses, holding the hanger and swaying in front of the mirror.
0:50:58|0:51:20|[Qin Fen] leaned against the door frame, holding a plate and eating the watermelon inside. He mumbled some opinions, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] glanced at her clothes absentmindedly. Then she carefully selected a pair of earrings from the jewelry box on the bedside table, but was interrupted by [Qin Fen].
0:51:41|0:51:59|[Liang Xiaoxiao] smiled and put on two different styles of high-heeled sandals on her left and right feet. The urgent ringtone of her phone sounded, but she quickly turned it off. After tying her shoelaces, she looked at [Qin Fen]. While [Qin Fen] pointed at the shoe on her right foot, [Liang Xiaoxiao] did the opposite and immediately took off the shoe on her right foot, replacing it with the same one as her left foot.
0:51:59|0:52:4|The setting sun's afterglow spills over the stairs in the mountains,
0:52:11|0:52:30|[Qin Fen] still shook his head, [Liang Xiaoxiao] turned around and smiled, feeling the guy's affection. Like this, with [Liang Xiaoxiao] in front, carrying a beautiful long dress, and [Qin Fen] behind, wearing sunglasses and a hat, the two walked up the long bridge. When they reached the center of the bridge, [Qin Fen] stopped.
0:52:30|0:52:35|[Liang Xiaoxiao] walked confidently towards the other end. The beauty pageant at night was filled with dazzling fireworks.
0:52:41|0:52:55|The noisy music, colorful fireworks, and lively crowd. On the big screen, a pair of giant angel wings appeared, with five big characters printed out: Angel at Emmy. Groups of photographers and distinguished guests filled the audience, showcasing the grandeur of the evening.
0:53:42|0:53:55|The [Host] was the first to exit the stage. With the music starting, the audience's emotions were immediately stirred up. The beauty who appeared on the left was dressed boldly, with the overall look tied together with ribbons into a bow, only covering the important parts of her body.
0:53:56|0:54:14|Soon, the V-shaped stage was filled with slender and plump beauties. On the other side, [Qin Fen] dived into the pool, and the pool shimmered with light on the mountaintop at night. Before long, [Qin Fen] returned to the bedroom and watched the live broadcast of the beauty pageant on TV.
0:54:50|0:55:0|On the scene, the beauties changed into new outfits and walked onto the stage again. In the audience, Liang Xiaoxiao's phone rang, and she saw that it was Qin Fen calling, thinking that something urgent must have happened.
0:55:10|0:55:36|Perhaps she was hoping that [Qin Fen] would come to the scene to accompany her, and soon enough, [Qin Fen] arrived by car. The car stopped at the hotel entrance, [Qin Fen] entered and made a phone call, then approached a waiter to inquire. By the poolside, the girls were dressed boldly.
0:55:36|0:55:47|They held champagne and swayed around the pool. Sexy models swam in the pool, while the bar was filled with helium balloons. Under the spotlight, the enthusiastic crowd looked strange.
0:55:47|0:56:4|His behavior became more bizarre. [Qin Fen] looked around, trying to catch a glimpse of [Liang Xiaoxiao], but she was nowhere to be seen. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Wang Jianguo sneaked up behind [Qin Fen] and pinched his butt hard. Drunk, he held a glass of wine and urged [Qin Fen] to have some too. Meanwhile, in a certain restroom,
0:56:5|0:56:13|[Liang Xiaoxiao] is vomiting in front of the pool, and the host is taking care of her. At this moment, [Qin Fen] happens to walk in through the door.
0:56:24|0:56:28|Liang Xiaoxiao didn't speak clearly in one sentence and started to vomit again.
0:56:41|0:56:56|The host walked out of the bathroom, and [Qin Fen] stepped forward to pat [Liang Xiaoxiao] on the back. The host came back with a bandage and gave some advice. It was only now that [Liang Xiaoxiao] recovered, leaning against the wall and sitting on the ground.
0:57:2|0:57:10|[Qin Fen] stood still in front of her, looking at his beloved girl in such a state, feeling more heartache than anger. He squatted down beside [Liang Xiaoxiao],
0:57:11|0:57:26|Saying that, he reached out to tidy up [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s hair, [Liang Xiaoxiao] was panting. [Qin Fen] gently tidied her hair, [Liang Xiaoxiao] pushed away [Qin Fen]'s hand.
0:57:30|0:57:41|[Liang Xiaoxiao] buried her head in her knees in agony, she adjusted her state and said, [Qin Fen] still knelt on one knee, unmoved.
0:57:49|0:58:12|[Liang Xiaoxiao], with a sense of helplessness, picked up the wine glass and once again plunged into the crowd, continuing the revelry. Swaying, she bumped into passersby one after another, but her staggering steps still managed to find the place to drink. She handed the cup to the bartender for a refill, then dove back into the crowd. With her hair disheveled, she tilted her head back and gulped it down.
0:58:14|0:58:23|Finally, [Qin Fen] came up and snatched the wine glass from her hand, grabbing her arm with one hand, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] kicked off her sandals and threw them into the pool.
0:58:24|0:58:35|[Qin Fen] was about to fish out the shoes, but [Liang Xiaoxiao] once again dove into the crowd. [Qin Fen] could only first retrieve the shoes from the pool. These shoes were chosen by [Liang Xiaoxiao] before she left, they must be her favorite pair.
0:58:36|0:58:43|The celebration party seemed to have ended, but [Liang Xiaoxiao] was nowhere to be found. [Qin Fen] arrived at the beach,
0:58:44|0:58:50|In a rush, he shouted towards the sea in desperation, as the cool seawater flowed over Qin Fen's sandals in the cool night.
0:58:56|0:59:6|[Qin Fen] followed the sound and, after searching with his eyes for a while, finally spotted [Liang Xiaoxiao] barefoot on the beach not far away. He immediately walked briskly towards that direction.
0:59:7|0:59:26|Approaching, [Qin Fen] finally saw [Liang Xiaoxiao] sitting on the ground, hugging her knees, messy hair covering her face. [Qin Fen] still couldn't be sure until he got closer and bent down to take a look. The weather was getting cooler, unfortunately it was a cloudy day, on the same gloomy sea surface, a figure was drifting towards this side.
0:59:26|0:59:30|It turns out to be [Liang Xiaoxiao], drifting towards the beach with the waves.
0:59:31|0:59:43|On the beach, only [Qin Fen] stood alone, his lonely figure somewhat desolate. Approaching the shore, [Liang Xiaoxiao] walked towards [Qin Fen], with wet clothes and messy hair clinging to her body.
0:59:43|0:59:57|She walked barefoot on the beach, step by step towards [Qin Fen], all emotions and turbulent thoughts completely emptied at this moment. Sitting across from [Qin Fen], they were silent for a while, until [Liang Xiaoxiao] spoke first.
1:1:12|1:1:16|[Liang Xiaoxiao] gazed at [Qin Fen],
1:1:20|1:1:36|There was an indescribable look in her eyes, and the seawater on her hair dripped down the ends. [Qin Fen] slowly stood up, ignoring [Liang Xiaoxiao], and left without helping her with her shoes.
1:1:39|1:1:58|In the end, leaving behind these words, also leaving [Liang Xiaoxiao] sitting alone on the beach. Inside the house, [Liang Xiaoxiao] woke up. Still in the same clothes with messy hair. She got up from the sofa, barefoot on the floor, took a few steps and felt pain under her feet. Leaning against the wall, supporting herself, she lifted her foot and took a closer look.
1:1:59|1:2:18|The soles of her feet were covered in cuts, making it painful to touch, so she had to use her toes to go take a shower first. Just as she rushed past the bedroom, she saw the sunlight streaming onto the balcony, with [Qin Fen] sitting on a stool, using a hairdryer to blow dry his shoes. Seeing this scene, she was a bit stunned.
1:2:18|1:2:25|[Qin Fen] didn't find [Liang Xiaoxiao] getting up, still blowing his sandals seriously. Seeing this scene, [Liang Xiaoxiao] felt a little guilty.
1:2:28|1:2:35|She tiptoed into the bathroom, brushing her teeth while taking a shower. The seawater wasn't as clean as the swimming pool, otherwise she wouldn't have cut her foot.
1:2:36|1:2:53|She grabbed her hair, unbuttoned her clothes, and let her dress slide down to her feet. With a kick, it landed perfectly on the toilet seat. In the summer, dark clouds quickly covered the mountaintop, and the rumbling thunder arrived on cue.
1:2:53|1:3:8|[Liang Xiaoxiao] put on a comfortable nightgown and limped through the bedroom. In the living room, she saw [Qin Fen] lying comfortably on the sofa. She walked unsteadily to him and stood by his side. [Qin Fen] didn't say anything, just looked at her coldly.
1:3:8|1:3:17|[Liang Xiaoxiao] simply folded the nightgown and sat on the coffee table. She looked at [Qin Fen], who was also looking at her askance. The two of them remained in a stalemate for a while.
1:3:19|1:3:34|[Liang Xiaoxiao] lifted her foot and placed it on [Qin Fen]'s body. [Qin Fen] held her injured foot tenderly and said, [Liang Xiaoxiao] put her foot down and stared at [Qin Fen]. The atmosphere of the conversation once again fell into an icy silence.
1:3:34|1:3:43|Outside the window, rain started falling timely. [Qin Fen] remained indifferent, but [Liang Xiaoxiao] couldn't take it anymore. She grabbed the cushion from the sofa and threw it aside.
1:3:43|1:3:52|[Qin Fen] moved over a bit, and [Liang Xiaoxiao] lay down beside [Qin Fen]. She took [Qin Fen]'s hand, wrapped it around her neck, this was the first time the two had been so intimate.
1:3:52|1:4:4|[Liang Xiaoxiao] wrapped her arms around [Qin Fen], fully aware of her actions and feeling guilty for hurting this man. She comforted [Qin Fen], as if comforting herself, saying,
1:4:14|1:4:20|Finally, she couldn't hold it anymore, sadness and joy playing out on her face, she controlled the corners of her mouth.
1:4:22|1:4:35|[Liang Xiaoxiao] gave a bitter smile and took a bite at [Qin Fen]. [Qin Fen] didn't dodge, he could still pamper [Liang Xiaoxiao] at this moment.
1:4:36|1:4:45|[Liang Xiaoxiao] vented her frustrations and tears streamed down her face, but she still managed to force a smile.
1:5:4|1:5:9|She frowned, her eyes red and teary, knowing she couldn't let go.
1:5:18|1:5:47|In the end, Qin Fen couldn't bear to make her angry. Liang Xiaoxiao pondered Qin Fen's words, then turned and threw herself into Qin Fen's arms. Qin Fen gently embraced her. His heart was unusually calm at this moment. When he accepted the affection on the beach, he knew the outcome would be like this.
1:6:11|1:6:29|The ceiling fan was gently turning, and the people under the fan were leaning against each other. Outside the window, it was raining heavily at the moment, as if filling the dialogue between the two. The rain fell on the balcony, on the trees, and also on the beautiful wooden staircase. It was unknown how long the rain had been falling, and [Liang Xiaoxiao] didn't know how long she had been asleep.
1:6:29|1:6:44|She woke up groggily from the bed, realizing she was topless. She recalled the scene again, remembering that she cried herself to sleep. Of course, waking up in bed was not surprising, Liang Xiaoxiao was already used to the feeling of being taken care of by him.
1:6:44|1:7:4|[Xiaoxiao] propped herself up and climbed out of bed, wrapping herself in a blanket as she shuffled towards the edge of the bed. As soon as her feet touched the ground, she felt something was off. Lifting her foot to inspect, she saw all the wounds on her soles were tightly covered with band-aids. [Xiaoxiao] looked around and didn't see her clothes, so she simply wrapped the blanket around herself like a bathrobe and got out of bed.
1:7:7|1:7:22|She walked somewhat unsteadily into the empty living room, the long quilt dragging on the floor like a train. With her hair loose, she looked like a goddess from ancient Roman mythology descending to earth. She glanced around, not seeing the figure of [Qin Fen], and sat down on the sofa chair.
1:7:22|1:7:29|Suddenly, she caught sight of a glaring white paper on the side cabinet, and somehow she already knew what was written on it.
1:7:30|1:7:37|She still stepped forward to pick up the piece of paper, which was the letter left by [Qin Fen], and she began to read it carefully.
1:8:2|1:8:10|[Liang Xiaoxiao] saw this, turned around and sat on the ground, hugging her knees, looking out the window with a lost expression.
1:8:56|1:9:17|The pilot pushed the control stick, and the plane smoothly took off, soaring in the sky above the mountains and rivers. The plane flew through the clouds, and even the sun obscured by the clouds still shone brightly.
1:9:17|1:9:39|Near the plane, if you look closely, you will easily spot the beautiful figure of [Liang Xiaoxiao] in front of the airplane window. At this moment, she is propping up her chin with one hand, looking calmly but with a hint of melancholy at the scenery outside the window. The plane glides past the clouds, heading towards the distant sparkling lights.
1:11:24|1:11:38|[Liang Xiaoxiao] sat in the airport shuttle bus with a melancholy expression, watching the program being broadcast on the bus. She couldn't help but miss that person. In the company's rest area, Xuan Xuan and [Qin Fen] sat on either side, while [Li Xiangshan] in the middle looked at the photos on the screen and said,
1:13:28|1:13:34|Xuan Xuan on the side felt puzzled, [Qin Fen] holding a cup of coffee, looking at [Li Xiangshan], who got up uncomfortably.
1:13:48|1:14:4|[Qin Fen] stared at [Li Xiangshan] and asked seriously. Xuan Xuan looked surprised, but without hesitation, she closed her notebook, picked up her laptop, and left.
1:14:7|1:14:31|This is said to Xuanxuan, but also to [Qin Fen]. Xuanxuan humbly accepts it and quickly runs away. [Li Xiangshan] returns to the sofa. In the afternoon, a mini car drives into the Beijing Fashion Design Plaza, with two people on board, [Mango] and [Liang Xiaoxiao].
1:14:31|1:14:41|At this time before the end of work, pedestrians and traffic were sparse. The two people who returned to the same city naturally had to meet up. The car took the two of them straight to the hotel they had booked.
1:14:42|1:14:51|The weather in Beijing is not as warm as in Sanya. Unlike the last time they met, this time both of them are wearing long pants. However, even so, it is difficult to hide the radiance of the two beautiful women walking together.
1:14:59|1:15:5|They placed their bags on the empty chair next to them and took a seat. The waiter brought menus to them separately.
1:15:7|1:15:15|Mango looked through the papers with a hint of displeasure, then suddenly spoke up.
1:15:25|1:15:43|Night falls, and the city's nightlife begins. Amid enthusiastic cheers, the young talents step out of luxury cars, waving and posing for the cameras.
1:15:43|1:15:59|The enthusiastic crowd cheered as they made their entrance. Various luxury cars came to a stop one after another at the charity gala named "Melting Glacier, Earth's Demise", which was set to be a grand stage for fame and fortune. The last car to arrive, a low-key black Mercedes, carried [Li Xiangshan] and [Qin Fen].
1:15:59|1:16:8|[Qin Fen] is a bit nervous in this kind of occasion, compared to [Li Xiangshan] who is much more familiar. He puts his arm around [Qin Fen]'s shoulder, and the two of them walk into the venue arm in arm.
1:17:14|1:17:22|A bottle of wine was sold for 500,000 yuan, and a beautiful woman named Xinyu walked across the red carpet amidst applause, presenting foreign liquor, and then hugged [Li Xiangshan].
1:17:31|1:17:37|Xiangshan helplessly glanced at [Qin Fen].
1:18:13|1:18:29|[Mango] picked up the ring and carefully examined the diamond symbolizing love, then handed it back to [Liang Xiaoxiao].
1:19:1|1:19:22|[Liang Xiaoxiao] waited for the next part, thinking about all this made [Liang Xiaoxiao] have a headache. She vigorously messed up her hair, which amused [Mango].
1:19:28|1:19:42|And at this moment, the Mercedes-Benz stopped at the entrance of the hotel. As fate would have it, [Li Xiangshan] and [Qin Fen] also arrived at this place, perhaps a place they used to frequent before they parted ways. The restaurant during peak dining hours was packed with people.
1:19:43|1:19:54|The waiter led the way, and the two arrived at a table outdoors. Sitting on the other side of the wall were [Mango] and [Liang Xiaoxiao], but neither of them noticed each other. The waiter brought the menu.
1:20:10|1:20:25|After speaking, [Li Xiangshan] eagerly uncorked the bottle of expensive wine. He stood up, poured himself a glass, raised it to his lips, drank deeply, savored the taste, nodded, and said,
1:20:31|1:20:42|Li Xiangshan poured the wine attentively without saying a word. After filling two glasses, he put down the wine glass and sat back, sipping his mouth while looking at Qin Fen.
1:20:43|1:20:56|[Qin Fen] stared in astonishment, while [Li Xiangshan] took off his shoes and pulled down his socks. There was a piece of gauze wrapped around the top of his foot, and [Li Xiangshan] carefully uncovered it to reveal a huge black mole, about the size of a one yuan coin.
1:20:56|1:21:7|He stepped on Qin Fen's chair, and when Qin Fen didn't understand, Li Xiangshan explained,
1:21:8|1:21:16|[Qin Fen] shook his head. At this point, [Li Xiangshan] actually laughed, and only then did [Qin Fen] cautiously look over.
1:21:27|1:21:35|[Li Xiangshan] smiled helplessly and rewrapped the gauze. [Qin Fen] just watched him quietly, digesting the bad news brought by [Li Xiangshan].
1:21:49|1:21:58|[Li Xiangshan] calmly raised his glass, while [Qin Fen] widened his eyes in anxiety. [Li Xiangshan] smiled calmly.
1:22:16|1:22:22|[Qin Fen] still can't let go, while everyone else is thinking about how to live, this person is thinking about how to die.
1:22:35|1:22:41|After speaking, [Qin Fen] picked up the glass of wine in front of him and drank it all in one gulp.
1:22:42|1:22:53|The strong liquor burned down his throat, and [Qin Fen] let out a sigh. Accepting the situation, [Qin Fen] turned to [Li Xiangshan] and asked,
1:22:59|1:23:4|Li Xiangshan waited for this line, and he sat up with a smile on his face.
1:23:32|1:23:39|[Li Xiangshan] laughed again when he mentioned this, pursing his lips as he reminisced.
1:24:1|1:24:20|Upon hearing this, [Li Xiangshan]’s expression changed, he stared at [Qin Fen] with displeasure, not speaking for a while. After a moment, he lowered his head in contemplation. [Qin Fen] looked at [Li Xiangshan] anxiously, afraid that [Li Xiangshan] would regret it for the rest of his life. For a father, the words "daughter" were too fatal.
1:24:40|1:24:48|But thinking of his daughter being so young, the father couldn't help but cry, [Li Xiangshan] furrowed his brow and adjusted his emotions for a long time.
1:25:22|1:25:38|[Qin Fen] had a hint of tears in his eyes. He forced a smile and [Li Xiangshan] continued speaking with pursed lips.
1:25:42|1:25:50|It was late at night outside the hotel, where two pairs of old friends upstairs were drinking until the wee hours.
1:25:51|1:25:58|The waiter handed over the bill, and [Mango] glanced at it before handing the card to the waiter on the shelf.
1:26:4|1:26:9|[Liang Xiaoxiao] walked towards the bathroom, and trouble followed her.
1:26:13|1:26:31|Just as Liang Xiaoxiao was about to push the door open, she suddenly heard a noise. She saw a man slumped by the sink, his shiny bald head immediately catching her attention. Liang Xiaoxiao walked slowly towards him, looking at him in disbelief, and after confirming, she softly asked, Qin Fen raised his head groggily.
1:26:31|1:27:6|He focused on the person in front of him, muttering something under his breath. He unsteadily raised his hand and placed it on [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s shoulder. Liang Xiaoxiao was completely puzzled by what he said. Only then did he lift the hand that was around Liang Xiaoxiao.
1:27:38|1:27:50|Outside, [Mango] took the bank card from the waiter and packed up their bags. At the same time, [Li Xiangshan] sitting outside finished the last drop of wine. He looked around and didn't see any sign of [Qin Fen], so he got up from his chair.
1:27:50|1:28:10|Staggering towards the hotel, [Liang Xiaoxiao] happened to pass by [Mango] rummaging through her bag. She was too drunk to notice, while [Mango] was busy sorting her bag and didn't see [Li Xiangshan]. [Li Xiangshan] stood still, looking around, and called a waiter to find [Qin Fen].
1:28:12|1:28:19|[Mango] recognized his voice, [Li Xiangshan] stopped in his tracks, [Mango] smiled and approached him.
1:28:29|1:28:48|[Li Xiangshan] looked dazed, his smile even brighter, exchanging familiar greetings with familiar faces. [Mango] gazed at him with a smile, the two of them standing face to face, when suddenly [Li Xiangshan] embraced [Mango].
1:28:50|1:29:0|The scene shifts to a nightclub, where young people are dancing to a lively rhythm, bathed in colorful lights. They sway their bodies, immersed in it, vigorously releasing their hormones.
1:29:0|1:29:13|On the colorful screen sofa, four people are sitting. [Li Xiangshan] sits upright, [Mango] has his arm around him, while [Qin Fen] is lying on the sofa, using [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s leg as a pillow. The four of them have no expression on their faces, looking out of place amidst the lively atmosphere around them.
1:29:13|1:29:25|[Li Xiangshan] stood still like a painting, while [Qin Fen] had already fallen asleep with his arms crossed. The indifference of several people was vividly displayed. Life is like a feast, no matter how lively, there will be a day when it disperses.
1:29:26|1:29:40|At dawn, with just a hint of sunlight on the horizon, the luxurious KTV private room was filled with all kinds of strange and exotic drinks on the bar. The place, which should have been lively, appeared unusually quiet, with the spacious room of about a hundred square meters empty.
1:29:40|1:29:51|The huge tatami mat looked lonely. [Qin Fen] was still sleeping on [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s lap, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] was quietly supporting her arms, accompanying him. They got drunk again, and spent the night without sleeping.
1:29:51|1:29:57|The young people couldn't handle this kind of gameplay. Perhaps in an uncomfortable position, [Qin Fen] moved his head and woke up.
1:29:58|1:30:13|[Liang Xiaoxiao] immediately noticed that [Qin Fen] shook his head and looked around, saying,
1:30:20|1:30:30|Upon hearing this, [Qin Fen] sat up straight. After all, they had separated, and neither wanted to owe the other anything. [Qin Fen] rubbed his head with both hands.
1:30:46|1:31:6|The two were more polite than ordinary friends. Although they were sitting on the same sofa, there was enough space in the middle for two more people to sit. [Qin Fen] didn't realize he was still wearing a ring on his finger, the one he used to propose on the Great Wall. He took off the ring, examined it for a while before speaking.
1:31:8|1:31:16|[Liang Xiaoxiao] didn't answer the question, she relaxed on the sofa and stretched lazily.
1:31:28|1:31:46|[Qin Fen] still holding the ring tightly, staring at it, [Liang Xiaoxiao] turned her head, reached out and took [Qin Fen]'s hand, then [Qin Fen] finally let go of the ring, and their fingers intertwined.
1:32:45|1:32:56|Above the cemetery, drizzling rain falls as [Qin Fen] holds an umbrella and follows behind [Li Xiangshan]. [Li Xiangshan] stops in his tracks, hands in his pockets, and says,
1:33:52|1:33:55|Li Xiangshan smiled wearily and looked at Qin Fen.
1:33:59|1:34:15|At this point, Li Xiangshan didn't care anymore. He just wanted to feel better. He sat shakily on the wet stone pillar, then grabbed Qin Fen's hands and leaned towards him. Li Xiangshan's head rested on Qin Fen's belly, showing how weak he was.
1:34:17|1:34:25|The two sentences seemed to have drained him of all his energy.
1:34:31|1:34:40|His health is deteriorating, he has to take three breaths after saying a sentence.
1:34:42|1:34:50|[Li Xiangshan] didn't bother to lift his head, just clung to [Qin Fen]'s arm and said, [Qin Fen] vaguely understood what he meant.
1:34:52|1:35:6|[Li Xiangshan]’s gloomy eyes suddenly lit up, he struggled to sit up and looked straight at [Qin Fen]. [Qin Fen], holding an umbrella, pressed his hand on his shoulder, and the two of them stood facing each other in the rain.
1:35:10|1:35:34|[Qin Fen], wearing a hat and holding an umbrella, looked somewhat comical. Taking advantage of still being able to move, [Qin Fen] fulfilled his promise and took [Li Xiangshan] to Sanya. On this day, at the airport in Sanya, [Liang Xiaoxiao] had just gotten off the plane and was walking with her luggage. A Japanese man pulling a suitcase passed in front of her and apologized.
1:35:35|1:35:42|[Liang Xiaoxiao] glanced in surprise, the hurried passerby seemed somewhat familiar, and she quickly caught up.
1:36:0|1:36:15|The sharp rhetorical question made [Liang Xiaoxiao] look away, realizing at that moment that she couldn't even count as an acquaintance. The so-called "dispersed transactions without dispersed relationships" can only be achieved by those who have never loved. It started pouring rain at the memorial service.
1:36:15|1:36:33|In the memorial hall, the guests have already taken their seats. On one wall hangs a poster of [Li Xiangshan], along with some monologues. The long table in front of the poster is filled with flowers, and about twenty to thirty guests are sitting below, fanning themselves with folding fans. [Qin Fen] walks onto the stage, leans against the bench with his back to the audience, and gazes at the poster in his own thoughts.
1:36:33|1:36:40|Adjusting his emotions, he turned around, took off his baseball cap, and his eyes casually scanned the audience below the stage before saying,
1:37:59|1:38:14|Li Xiangshan listened, tears shimmering in her eyes. Chuan Chuan, upon hearing this, couldn't help but feel a pang in her nose.
1:38:25|1:38:29|[Chuan Chuan] looked at him tearfully, blaming him, while [Qin Fen] nodded and smiled.
1:38:38|1:38:52|A gentle breeze blows, the candles flicker, and [Li Xiangshan] holds his daughter's hand in his palm.
1:39:14|1:39:16|Li Xiangshan smiled and said relievedly,
1:39:17|1:39:36|At the entrance, a sign reads "Li Xiangshan's Farewell Party," reflecting a off-road vehicle. A man in military uniform steps out of the car. He quickly walks around to the passenger side with an umbrella, opens the door, and embraces Mango as they walk towards here. Qin Fen, who has been waiting at the entrance, watches the two approaching quickly.
1:39:36|1:39:50|[Mango] held a bouquet of flowers in her arms, approached and gave [Qin Fen] a big hug, while her navy boyfriend was busy collecting the umbrella. [Mango] then sobbed on [Qin Fen]'s shoulder. Inside the memorial hall,
1:40:13|1:40:21|Wu Sang gets out of the taxi and Qin Fen quickly holds an umbrella for her.
1:40:36|1:40:41|[Wu Sang] slung her bag over her shoulder and walked towards the inside, while [Qin Fen] looked at the drenched [Liang Xiaoxiao] and couldn't say a word for a long time.
1:40:54|1:41:4|[Qin Fen] patted [Liang Xiaoxiao] on the shoulder and said, then he lightly held the umbrella over [Liang Xiaoxiao] and walked away.
1:42:12|1:42:17|Mango seemed a bit moved.
1:44:18|1:44:24|Hearing this, everyone in the audience couldn't help but be moved to tears, with [Wu Sang] gently embracing [Chuan Chuan].
1:44:41|1:44:49|[Chuan Chuan] timidly looked at her father, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] in the audience wiped her nose with red eyes, tears streaming down her cheeks.
1:45:34|1:45:40|The crowd here looked even more desolate upon hearing this, lowering their heads involuntarily. [Mango] also covered her face and wept.
1:45:57|1:46:12|In the past, everything is just a prologue. As the farewell ceremony entered its final stage, the guests raised their glasses, set aside their bouquets, and bid farewell to [Li Xiangshan] one by one. A man with thinning hair leaned in close to [Li Xiangshan] and gave him personal instructions, to which [Li Xiangshan] responded earnestly.
1:46:18|1:46:26|Next, the female subordinate is coming to offer a toast.
1:46:32|1:46:37|Xuan Xuan then squatted down next to [Li Xiangshan] with a glass of wine.
1:46:56|1:47:1|Xuan Xuan tried hard to hold back tears as she clinked glasses with [Li Xiangshan].
1:47:3|1:47:23|She took a sip, stood up reluctantly, and left. Just as Liang Xiaoxiao left, Mango came over, followed by Mango's new boyfriend. Mango lightly held Li Xiangshan's hand with one hand, and ruffled his hair with the other. Li Xiangshan held her cold hand, pressing it against his forehead.
1:47:35|1:47:42|Li Xiangshan held Li Jianqiang's hand with relief, looking at him. Li Jianqiang answered firmly,
1:47:56|1:48:9|Saying that, [Li Xiangshan] patted [Li Jianqiang]'s back of the hand and instructed. [Li Jianqiang] firmly shook his hand, leaving time for [Mango]. [Mango] squatted down, and [Li Xiangshan] adjusted the sitting posture forcefully.
1:48:38|1:48:50|Saying that, [Li Xiangshan] reached out to wipe the tears from Mango's face. Mango couldn't help but bury her head in Li Xiangshan's arms and cry, while Chuan Chuan turned away. Qin Fen then walked up and interrupted,
1:48:54|1:49:0|Mango stood up to make room, and Li Xiangshan tried hard to shake hands with Liang Xiaoxiao.
1:49:4|1:49:9|[Mango] glanced at [Qin Fen] beside her.
1:50:3|1:50:11|With the conversation reaching this point, both [Liang Xiaoxiao] and [Wu Sang] have tears streaming down their faces, while [Chuan Chuan] is sobbing on the wheelchair.
1:50:15|1:50:39|[Chuan Chuan] wiped away a tear, looked up at [Li Xiangshan]. [Liang Xiaoxiao] quickly pushed [Qin Fen] away, leaving the final moments to this father-daughter pair, holding hands tightly. The audience sat quietly below the stage.
1:51:41|1:52:2|[Chuan Chuan] leaned on her father's shoulder, while [Li Xiangshan] gently kissed her forehead. The afternoon harbor was filled with ships, the setting sun casting a golden edge on the sea. An old fishing boat slowly sailed out, heading towards the distance. It was around dusk.
1:52:2|1:52:10|The fishing boat arrived at a quiet sea, sailing quietly, carrying a person's life towards the end.
1:52:16|1:52:24|On the deck, [Li Xiangshan] is wearing a scarf, calmly looking at the sea, while [Qin Fen] remains the same, standing behind the wheelchair holding an umbrella.
1:52:24|1:52:39|The vast sea, where the water meets the sky in the distance, a small fishing boat, just a drop in the ocean. Apart from being tiny, there is nothing left but insignificance. [Li Xiangshan] hangs his hands, squinting at the sea, looking particularly peaceful.
1:52:46|1:53:2|He spoke like a gloomy old man, [Qin Fen] lowered his head and looked at him, gently placing his hand on his shoulder. [Li Xiangshan] struggled to raise his hand and gently patted [Qin Fen]'s back. [Qin Fen] put away the umbrella, helped push the wheelchair towards the cabin, he could only accompany him this far.
1:53:7|1:53:13|[Qin Fen] returned to the cabin absent-mindedly, looking out the window with his hand tightly gripping the railing.
1:53:15|1:53:32|[Li Xiangshan] jumped into the sea, while [Qin Fen] leaned his head against the window frame, hesitating to turn around. His best friend ended his life like this, despite all the foreshadowing earlier on, at this moment, he still couldn't let go. It was as if his soul had been taken away.
1:53:32|1:53:51|Staring blankly out the window, the hand clenched tightly had turned slightly pale. The empty wheelchair on the deck spoke of a life gone by. As the saying goes, life is but a journey of spiritual cultivation. In this long journey, all fame and fortune will have nothing to do with you when death arrives.
1:53:51|1:54:11|And in acquiring these external possessions, all experiences will become a part of your soul. No matter what kind of life script you go through hardships and difficulties, the rare thing is to face the tribulations of this practice with a peaceful heart, perhaps this is the true essence of life.
1:54:12|1:54:28|This afternoon, the house in the mountains where [Qin Fen] lived was rejuvenated, with a cool breeze blowing through. Inside the house, [Chuan Chuan] was wiping the base of a new flower pot. [Qin Fen] and [Liang Xiaoxiao] each carried a flower pot over, with a green spider plant inside the wooden pot.
1:54:28|1:54:40|The two of them worked together to place the thriving green ivy on the base. [Qin Fen] picked up the watering can and sprayed gently, while [Chuan Chuan] held up the vibrant leaves and sprayed water towards him. [Liang Xiaoxiao] fixed Chuan Chuan's hair and said,
1:54:42|1:55:6|[Chuan Chuan] pointed to her chest, [Liang Xiaoxiao] strolled and sat on the sofa, [Qin Fen] also put down the water bottle and walked to the window. The three of them seemed to have their own thoughts, the faint feeling on the sofa [Liang Xiaoxiao] sensed something, but she still chose to remain unchanged in response to changes.
1:55:6|1:55:21|[Qin Fen], leaning on the table, hesitated. He rubbed his eyes, hoping to calm his restless heart. After a moment's pause, he opened the cabinet and took out the diamond ring that had been returned by [Liang Xiaoxiao].
1:55:21|1:55:45|Finally, he turned around, his hands nervously rubbing the diamond ring. With determination, he looked at [Chuan Chuan] beside him and softly called out. After speaking, [Qin Fen] glanced at [Liang Xiaoxiao] next to him, while [Liang Xiaoxiao], as if knowing the outcome in advance, waited quietly for [Qin Fen]'s next move.
1:55:45|1:55:51|[Qin Fen] knelt down on one knee, holding up the diamond ring in his hand, and said to [Liang Xiaoxiao],
1:55:58|1:56:5|Just as he was about to put on the ring, [Liang Xiaoxiao] pulled back his hand discontentedly.
1:56:32|1:56:56|[Qin Fen] immediately smiled, he excitedly stood up and kissed [Chuan Chuan] on the forehead. [Qin Fen] held [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s hand and put a diamond ring on her finger. The car drove on the mountain road back, with lush trees decorating the journey.
1:57:32|1:57:37|In the back seat, [Chuan Chuan] saw the affection between the two and felt discontent. [Qin Fen] turned around and said,
1:57:40|1:57:58|After that, [Qin Fen] drove the car back on the way home. This mountain road carries the joys and sorrows of the two, but fortunately everything is back on track now. Regarding love and marriage, both [Qin Fen] and [Liang Xiaoxiao] have gained new understanding. In the tug of fate between the two, these have all come together.
1:57:58|1:58:7|The love-hate relationship belonging to [Qin Fen] comes to an end here.
