0:3:33|0:3:40|[Cheng Yong] drove a dilapidated van with a Prince Oil advertisement on it, and parked in front of the nursing home where his father lived.
0:3:48|0:3:53|Cheng Yong takes the bowl from the Forbidden City.
0:4:4|0:4:20|[Cheng Yong] feeds his father spoonful by spoonful. His father stubbornly keeps his mouth shut. After the meal, [Cheng Yong] goes to renew the subscription for the nursing home.
0:4:36|0:5:22|[Cheng Yong] took a pack of cigarettes from his bag and awkwardly handed it to the cashier, winking at him. He took his son to the bathhouse, where they played and laughed in the bath. Cheng Yong vigorously scrubbed his son with a washcloth, making his son's face light up with happiness. After drying his son with a towel, the boy shyly covered himself. They then went to a steamed bun shop together.
0:5:30|0:6:10|[Cheng Yong] showed a subtle expression and asked his son. He took out his wallet from the bag beside him, glanced at his son, took out some money from the wallet and handed it to his son. Then he stuffed a steamed bun into his mouth, and after finishing the meal, his ex-wife came to pick up their son. Hearing the whistle, [Cheng Yong] walked to the passenger window, where his ex-wife, pregnant, was sitting in the driver's seat.
0:7:51|0:8:8|[Cao Bin] in a leather jacket pushed open the door of the police station and walked straight towards [Cheng Yong], who had just been investigated. When he saw him, he rushed over in anger. The surrounding police officers quickly grabbed his waist to stop him. [Cao Bin] grabbed something from the table and smashed it towards [Cheng Yong], shouting at him:
0:8:15|0:8:31|The three police officers released their hands that were blocking the way. [Cao Bin] did not make another move, he glared fiercely at [Cheng Yong], cursed under his breath, and left. As he walked away, he even bumped into a young officer. The officers then began to clean up the mess quietly, picking up the scattered documents on the ground.
0:8:31|0:9:4|[Cao Bin] walked out of the police station with a cigarette in his mouth and got into the car. He glanced at his sister, threw the cigarette out of the window, and fanned the smoke in the car. Starting the car, [Cao Bin] said he would drive his sister back. The owner of the neighboring hotel came to find [Cheng Yong] again.
0:9:32|0:9:45|[Cheng Yong] stood at the door with toothpaste and ink on an old towel, looking at [Lv Shouyi] sitting in the shop wearing three layers of masks. [Lv Shouyi] took off the mask, smiled at him, and nodded in greeting.
0:10:27|0:10:42|[Lv Shouyi] took out his phone. [Cheng Yong] smoked and waved at him while looking at the computer. [Lv Shouyi] wrote down a phone number on a small card and handed it to [Cheng Yong].
0:10:45|0:11:17|[Cheng Yong] looked up at [Lv Shouyi] with a hint of compassion in his worldly eyes. [Lv Shouyi] walked towards the door, gesturing to [Cheng Yong], who hesitated, took a puff of his cigarette, glanced at the small piece of paper in front of him, and disdainfully tossed it onto the messy table. The scene shifted to the nursing home, where a palace servant pushed a food cart into a room. To everyone's surprise, [Cheng Yong]'s father suddenly collapsed upon opening the door. The caregiver calmly left with a lunchbox, while the doctor removed his surgical cap and exited the operating room.
0:11:44|0:12:3|[The doctor] finished speaking and turned to go upstairs, leaving [Cheng Yong] with a face full of anxiety and helplessness. [Cheng Yong] stared intently at [the doctor] going upstairs. [Cheng Yong] smoked a cigarette and drove an old van, his face through the car window filled with blindness and impatience, revealing a sense of powerlessness, resentment, and despair.
0:12:3|0:12:18|In the rearview mirror, the father lay with his eyes closed in the back seat, [Cheng Yong] opened his phone's contact list and scrolled to Xiao Shu's mother. Drinking at the barbecue stall, he finally decided to make the call, but before he could dial, he immediately hung up.
0:12:18|0:13:2|[Cheng Yong] had a face full of entanglement and helplessness, not touching the barbecue on the table. He smoked one cigarette after another, and drank one bottle after another. At this moment, someone handed him a business card. The advertisement on the card made him thoughtful. He seemed to see the hope of his father surviving, like grasping at a life-saving straw. He walked quickly in a small alley, his face filled with contemplation, until he reached the entrance of his own shop. The words "Pay rent to open" were posted on the rolling shutter door. [Cheng Yong] smashed open a window from the side and entered, holding a flashlight, searching for something in the temple.
0:13:2|0:13:19|In the box, cabinet, and cracks in the wall, he searched one place after another. He found a piece of paper, glanced at it, and then threw it down. He continued searching and finally found a business card with the phone number of [Lv Shouyi] under the keyboard.
0:13:56|0:14:19|[Cheng Yong] went to the hospital the next day to inquire about Gleevec. In the hallway, he saw a chronic leukemia patient. The patient made eye contact with [Cheng Yong], who noticed the mottled spots on his legs caused by leukemia. Outside the entrance of the Gleevec manufacturing company, a group of leukemia patients and their families were protesting with banners that read "Protest against sky-high drug prices."
0:15:22|0:15:35|During the protest, someone threw feces at a pharmaceutical representative, causing the representative to flee in panic. The anger of the crowd reached its peak. Security guards tried to stop the advancing crowd, while [Lv Shouyi] sat below a banner, eating a boxed meal and laughing heartily.
0:15:37|0:15:55|[Lv Shouyi] then arrived at Cheng Yong's home. Cheng Yong was reading materials about Glenevin. Lv Shouyi pushed the test report and a pill of Indian Glenevin in front of Cheng Yong.
0:16:4|0:16:47|[Lv Shouyi] gave [Cheng Yong] a reassuring look, as [Cheng Yong] pondered on his face, then turned to him and said. [Lv Shouyi] paused for a second and nodded. [Cheng Yong] boarded the plane to India, and after getting off the plane, he met up with the Indian translator. On the way to the pharmaceutical factory, [Cheng Yong] also observed the local customs and practices in India, sitting in a small car with the window half open, looking out.
0:16:47|0:17:5|On a scorching summer day, the streets of India are crowded with people and rickshaws. [Cheng Yong] in the car appears somewhat impatient, as the narrow streets are packed with pedestrians and the car moves slowly behind the crowd, honking occasionally. Various shops line both sides of the street, and livestock can be seen scattered among the crowd.
0:17:6|0:17:37|The small vendors selling spices, food, and handicrafts bustled on the street. [Cheng Yong] helplessly dispersed the children running after the small car, sweating profusely. The small car finally drove away from the street. [Cheng Yong] and the translator arrived at the entrance of the pharmaceutical factory, where they went in to start negotiating with the boss.
0:18:56|0:19:8|Cheng Yong, who bought the Glonoin, decided to take the water route and started bargaining with the sailors.
0:19:47|0:20:4|The sailor hid the box of drugs in the corner of the kitchen freezer. In the sunset, Cheng Yong took off his glasses, looked at the sea, and recalled the words the drug dealer had said during the negotiation.
0:20:15|0:20:26|His eyes, as he smokes, reveal a calculating look. The scene shifts to the hospital, where [Lv Shouyi] is having blood drawn from his spine by a needle as thick as a water pipe by a doctor.
0:20:45|0:20:58|[Cheng Yong] showed the medicine he brought back to [Lv Shouyi] at home. There was a gleam of excitement in [Lv Shouyi]'s eyes, and his hands were trembling as he grabbed [Cheng Yong]'s leg.
0:21:21|0:21:29|[Cheng Yong] coldly closes the suitcase and ignores [Lv Shouyi] who starts eating noodles. [Lv Shouyi] takes out a box of medicine and says to [Cheng Yong]:
0:21:33|0:21:57|The next day, Cheng Yong and Cao Bin arrived at the hospital in a run-down van. They tried to recommend Indian Glivec to the patients, but no one in the hospital paid attention to them. They faced repeated setbacks.
0:22:17|0:22:25|At night, Cheng Yong and Cao Bin drove to a health center in a dilapidated alley. They knocked on each door one by one to inquire.
0:22:39|0:22:54|[Cheng Yong] saw no hope in sales, so he grabbed [Lv Shouyi] by the clothes and pulled him out of the health club. [Lv Shouyi], who was eating noodles, looked at [Cheng Yong] in astonishment after hearing this sentence.
0:23:11|0:23:37|Two people arrived at a nightclub, this is the first time Cheng Yong saw Liu Sihui. The nightclub was filled with passion and excitement, screams rose and fell in the music, Lv Shouyi actually brought Cheng Yong here to find a friend with an illness. Cheng Yong pulled back a curtain, and scantily clad dancers were twisting sexy dance moves on stage. The two moved through the crowded nightclub, occasionally stealing glances at the dancers on stage.
0:23:38|0:24:19|This place is relaxed and full of vitality, which is incompatible with the word "cancer" that is full of despair. [Lv Shouyi] suddenly points to the stage. [Cheng Yong] looks over and sees a very beautiful woman in a black lace suit, with big wavy hair looking particularly lazy in the night. She twists her body extremely coquettishly on the steel pipe, captivating everyone below the stage with her beauty.
0:24:27|0:24:35|Lv Shouyi is eating buns heartily in the restaurant.
0:24:44|0:24:55|Two people were talking when suddenly a group of masked individuals arrived at the door. [Liu Sihui] peeked out from among the crowd and walked up.
0:26:10|0:26:50|[Cheng Yong] frowned and lit a cigarette, [Lv Shouyi] glanced over and took off his mask first, [Liu Sihui] signaled with her eyes for everyone to follow suit. All the patients who came took off their masks one after another, and as soon as they did, someone started coughing. [Cheng Yong] scanned everyone, [Liu Sihui] sighed, the continuous coughing and painful expressions made [Cheng Yong] feel a bit uneasy. After speaking, [Cheng Yong] stubbed out the cigarette in the ashtray. Once on the bus, [Cheng Yong] flipped through the order form.
0:28:8|0:28:40|Lv Shouyi was delivering goods to a patient in the van. After loading the goods, he closed the van door and started counting a stack of RMB. He was so focused on counting the money that he didn't notice someone approaching the van. The van was opened from the outside, and a thug-like young man with dyed hair, Huang Mao, stood in front of him. The two stared at each other, and without saying a word, Huang Mao took several boxes of medicine from a black bag beside him.
0:28:42|0:29:4|Lv Shouyi grabbed his hand, but Huang Mao shook it off forcefully. In the struggle, the two fell under the car, and Huang Mao quickly picked up the drugs. Stopping in his tracks, Huang Mao turned back and walked up to Lv Shouyi. Lv Shouyi looked nervously at Huang Mao, thinking he was going to attack, but Huang Mao picked up a box of drugs from the ground and made a provocative expression towards Lv Shouyi.
0:29:17|0:29:28|Cheng Yong and Lv Shouyi found Huang Mao at the pig slaughterhouse. Cheng Yong chased Huang Mao with a stick as thick as an arm, while Lv Shouyi followed behind. Huang Mao jumped into the pigpen, Cheng Yong couldn't reach him, so he swung the stick and hit Huang Mao on the head.
0:29:30|0:29:57|The chase continued onto the street, with [Huang Mao] knocking down pedestrians and stealing a bicycle to escape. [Cheng Yong] and [Cao Bin] followed closely in a van. [Huang Mao] accelerated onto the road, with [Cheng Yong] honking and chasing after. [Huang Mao] turned into an alley, trying to shake off [Cheng Yong], but to his surprise, [Cheng Yong] followed closely behind.
0:30:20|0:30:35|[Cheng Yong] and [Lv Shouyi] got off the car and chased [Huang Mao] on foot. When [Cheng Yong] caught up with [Huang Mao], he kicked him down, pinned him to the ground, and [Lv Shouyi] held down his legs. Unable to resist, [Huang Mao] was firmly pressed down by [Cheng Yong]. With a fierce look, [Cheng Yong] asked:
0:30:37|0:30:59|[Huang Mao] brought two people to a dark and damp house, where [Cheng Yong] and [Lv Shouyi] discovered that the medicine was actually stolen by [Huang Mao] to give to a young girl. [Cheng Yong] looked around with a disdainful yet compassionate gaze, standing with his hands in his pockets. [Lv Shouyi] handed the opened medicine bottle to [Cheng Yong], who shook it and found there wasn't much left. [Cheng Yong] questioned:
0:31:14|0:31:37|[Cheng Yong] relentlessly cut a sound, looked down and saw a photo of the family of three of [Huang Mao] on the table. He pulled the photo out of the glass pad and examined it carefully. [Huang Mao] ignored [Cheng Yong]'s question and just looked at him quietly. [Cheng Yong] put down the photo.
0:31:42|0:32:1|The next day, Cheng Yong paid the rent to the landlord, and the door of the health product store was finally opened. This time, Cheng Yong brought other people here.
0:32:13|0:32:31|Pastor Liu was called by Cheng Yong to be in charge of communicating with the drug dealer. After a conversation, Cheng Yong became the agent, and the Thai drug dealer began smuggling boxes of medicine into China. Cheng Yong also made a profit in this business.
0:33:4|0:33:51|The 5-person drug-selling group consisting of [Cheng Yong], [Lv Shouyi], [Liu Sihui], [Pastor Liu], and [Huang Mao] was established, where everyone exchanged what they wanted in this cooperation. [Cheng Yong], Li Shengyi, and [Huang Mao] arrived at the dock to inspect and pick up the goods. The three used a van to transport the Indian Gleneagles to the health product store. Patients received the news and lined up at [Cheng Yong]'s place to buy Gleneagles. [Pastor Liu] also organized the sick to buy Indian Gleneagles at the church, and the various patient groups organized by him also sold goods for [Cheng Yong] in major hospitals.
0:33:51|0:34:55|Due to the significantly lower price of Indian Glivec compared to the government, the group led by [Cheng Yong] made a fortune in this business. They were settling their income in his health product store, where [Cheng Yong] acted like a boss. The popularity of Indian Glivec was increasing, and their business was booming. The money for buying medicine from all over Shanghai piled up in this small shop. The five of them were happily dancing in the store, and [Cheng Yong]'s father's medical expenses were finally taken care of. The worry that had been hanging over [Cheng Yong] for his father was finally lifted, as his father was wheeled into the operating room. Boxes of medicine filled [Cheng Yong]'s store, and usually, two people coming in and out could bump into each other.
0:35:37|0:35:57|Business was booming, but danger lurked just around the corner. [Cao Bin] was applying medicine to his injured hand at the police station. After a quick application, [Cao Bin] promptly got up.
0:37:17|0:37:28|After settling the accounts in the store, Cheng Yong distributed the profits to the others.
0:37:44|0:37:51|[Huang Mao] expressionless, said nothing, picked up his clothes from the sofa on the side and gestured to leave.
0:37:58|0:38:16|[Cheng Yong] leaned back in the leather chair and glanced at [Huang Mao], while [Lv Shouyi] shouted at [Huang Mao]. [Liu Sihui] pulled [Huang Mao] in front of [Cheng Yong], quickly picked up the medicine on the table, and handed it to him. [Cheng Yong] smiled ambiguously.
0:38:20|0:39:1|Huang Mao apologized. So the five of them arrived at the bar where they first met Liu Sihui. Just as everyone was having a good time, the bar manager suddenly approached. Liu Sihui looked displeased, but didn't resist. Cheng Yong glanced disapprovingly.
0:39:22|0:39:32|Liu Sihui glanced at Cheng Yong, who sat back in his seat. The leader, with a displeased expression, adjusted his tie and also sat down.
0:39:42|0:39:49|Cheng Yong finished speaking and everyone laughed.
0:39:59|0:41:4|[Cheng Yong] took out a stack of banknotes from his bag and threw them on the table one by one. The person in charge was stunned. [Cheng Yong] continued to throw money, [Liu Sihui] looked at [Cheng Yong] gratefully. The person in charge licked his lips, looked at [Cheng Yong], then turned to the stage and started dancing provocatively with a steel pole in his arms. [Cheng Yong] and [Liu Sihui] pointed at him and laughed heartily. [Liu Sihui] cheered loudly, and [Lv Shouyi] and Lawyer Ling laughed heartily while watching the man on stage stripping. [Huang Mao] was drinking from a bottle on the side. [Liu Sihui] shouted out the lyrics loudly, tears streaming down her face. [Cheng Yong] looked at [Liu Sihui] thoughtfully.
0:41:25|0:41:39|Cheng Yong insisted on taking Liu Sihui back. The two arrived at Liu Sihui's home. Cheng Yong was fixing his hair in front of the blank TV screen. When Liu Sihui pushed open the door and entered, Cheng Yong immediately stood up, pretending he hadn't done anything.
0:41:39|0:41:59|[Liu Sihui] turned off the light in the room and handed [Cheng Yong] a glass of water. [Cheng Yong] took the glass of water, looked at [Liu Sihui] in confusion as she left, and with a slight smile on his lips, he raised the glass to drink, only to spit it out because the water was too hot.
0:42:2|0:42:14|He then placed the water cup on the bedside table, pressed the bed with his elbow, and immediately started dancing and humming while taking off his clothes.
0:42:16|0:42:49|As he was down to just a white undershirt, Cheng Yong's daughter appeared at the door. He quickly picked up the clothes he had thrown out, awkwardly pulled the bedsheet over, and put on the clothes. His little daughter stood at the door expressionless, looking at him. Cheng Yong glanced at the photo of Liu Sihui and her daughter on the wall. Just then, Liu Sihui, wearing a sexy silk lingerie, pushed the door open and took off her nightgown.
0:43:18|0:43:36|Liu Sihui wanted to take off Cheng Yong's short sleeves, but Cheng Yong resisted. Cheng Yong pushed Liu Sihui onto the bed, straightened his clothes, and then Liu Sihui got up and said to Cheng Yong,
0:43:56|0:44:16|[Cheng Yong] finished speaking, picked up his coat and pushed the door open, walking out of the bedroom. [Liu Sihui] followed as [Cheng Yong] closed the door and left, leaving [Liu Sihui] alone.
0:44:41|0:44:57|Cheng Yong was unaware of the crisis approaching, playing cards in the store with Huang Mao and Lv Shouyi. The three of them looked at each other, with Cheng Yong showing a calculating expression.
0:46:37|0:46:47|[Cheng Yong] and his group looked around the venue at the people raising their hands, while the fake medicine seller, Academician Zhang, jumped off the stage.
0:47:27|0:47:43|Professor Zhang bowed deeply amidst applause, [Cheng Yong] looked disdainful. Professor Zhang then cheerfully jumped onto the stage, where his assistant patted him on the back and exchanged a few words with him.
0:49:23|0:50:5|[Huang Mao] saw the scammer in action, stepped on the table and crossed over the crowd, kicking the scammer. Others in the audience were stunned, and a few security guards started to surround [Huang Mao]. Seeing this, [Liu Sihui] tied up her hair, grabbed a chair, and rushed to the front, smashing the chair at the security guards. The guards were knocked down by [Liu Sihui]. [Cheng Yong] and [Lv Shouyi] also joined in. [Cheng Yong] picked up a glass bottle and smashed it at the security guard who was pulling [Liu Sihui]'s hair. The scene descended into chaos, with [Cheng Yong] and his group engaging in a fierce brawl with the other side. Everyone grabbed whatever they could find to strike each other. [Lv Shouyi] put a cardboard box over a security guard's head, and they struggled over a human-shaped sign. The guard was thrown to the ground by [Lv Shouyi], and the table, piled up like a small mountain with fake medicines, was overturned by [Lv Shouyi].
0:50:5|0:50:34|The patient buying medicine at the venue immediately rushed forward to grab the fake Lenin on the ground. [Lv Shouyi] used a human-shaped sign without a head to block himself, [Huang Mao] fought a group of security guards alone and didn't fall behind. [Huang Mao] fell to the ground, and [Cheng Yong] immediately ran over to help. [Cheng Yong] punched a security guard in the face and dragged [Huang Mao] away. Five people were surrounded in the center by the fake medicine gang, and Academician Zhang, who sold fake medicine, climbed up from the ground with blood all over his mouth, pointing fiercely at [Cheng Yong].
0:50:44|0:50:52|The fight becomes more intense, with a group of people exchanging blows at the venue, while [Cheng Yong] chases the fake medicine peddler around the room.
0:51:2|0:51:10|[Lv Shouyi] tilted his head with a nosebleed, bent his knees and walked to the table to sign. Then [Cheng Yong] straightened his clothes, took the pen handed by [Lv Shouyi], and stepped forward to sign.
0:51:26|0:51:33|After it was done, Cheng Yong drove Lv Shouyi home. Cheng Yong lowered his head to leave, but Lv Shouyi suddenly popped out of the car window.
0:51:36|0:51:45|[Cheng Yong] followed [Lv Shouyi] home as a guest. A family photo of three stood on a table filled with medicine, a wooden crib under a rotating mobile, with a sleeping baby lying inside.
0:52:31|0:52:41|During dinner, Mrs. Lv poured herself a glass of wine and raised it to Cheng Yong, thanking him.
0:52:47|0:52:53|Mrs. Lv finished her drink in one gulp, and [Cheng Yong] also finished the wine in his cup.
0:53:16|0:53:30|Returning home in the evening, [Cheng Yong] flipped through a photo of himself and his son, his face filled with a happy smile. A knock on the door interrupted [Cheng Yong]'s reminiscence. He walked towards the door and asked.
0:53:41|0:53:57|[Cheng Yong] opened the door and found it was the fake medicine seller, Academician Zhang. He immediately pulled down the rolling door, and Zhang pushed it up. [Cheng Yong] looked around at the door, afraid of being seen by others. Zhang picked up the health oil on the cabinet.
0:54:8|0:54:16|He put the health oil in his pocket and took out a bottle of Glenning from another pocket, placing it on the coffee table.
0:55:4|0:55:36|Professor Zhang stared at [Cheng Yong] intently, then took two steps back. Slowly, he approached [Cheng Yong] with the medicine and whispered into his ear. [Cheng Yong] turned his head away and walked to the door, gesturing for him to leave. Professor Zhang chuckled and whistled as he walked away.
0:55:41|0:55:57|[Cheng Yong] solemnly closed the door, the next day [Lv Shouyi] and Huang Mao came to the store to deliver goods. Just as they moved the medicine into the store, the phone rang.
0:56:5|0:56:9|Several police officers got out of the police car aggressively and headed straight into Cheng Yong's shop.
0:56:21|0:56:46|Huang Mao stood still, [Cheng Yong] quickly pulled him down to squat. The police officers searched through everything, [Cheng Yong] and the others nervously watched as the police didn't miss any corner, even checking the nooks and crannies. Just when they found nothing, a police officer shouted. The leading officer heard the shout and walked towards the inner room. [Cheng Yong] said with an unnatural expression.
0:57:4|0:57:12|After the police left, Cheng Yong watched Lv Shouyi and Huang Mao move the medicine box next to the garbage dump through the window.
0:57:21|0:57:51|[Cheng Yong] held the phone with a grim expression, remaining silent. As night fell, [Cheng Yong] stayed alone, smoking cigarette after cigarette. The deep night matched his gloomy mood, and he pondered seriously. The burning cigarette butt flickered in the night, and the alley in the rainy night exuded a human touch.
0:58:37|0:58:45|Everyone suddenly froze, quietly watching [Cheng Yong].
0:59:44|0:59:54|[Cheng Yong] stared at [Huang Mao] as he changed his sitting position.
1:0:10|1:0:16|[Cheng Yong] frowned, staring intently at [Huang Mao].
1:0:48|1:1:30|Others held back tears and dared not speak. [Huang Mao] picked up a beer, soaked in alcohol. [Cheng Yong] crossed his arms and watched everyone. [Huang Mao] lifted a full glass of alcohol, stood up, and stared at [Cheng Yong]. [Cheng Yong] stared back at him. He pursed his lips and, after saying those words, [Huang Mao] drank it all in one go. [Cheng Yong] kept his eyes fixed on [Huang Mao] without blinking. After finishing the drink, [Huang Mao] forcefully slammed the glass on the table, shattering it and cutting his hand. Blood spread in the beer bottle shards, but [Huang Mao] paid no attention and left the shop directly.
1:1:35|1:2:15|In silence, Cheng Yong looked at Liu Sihui. Liu Sihui took the cup from the side, drank it all in one gulp, without looking at Cheng Yong again, then put on her coat and left, disappearing into the night and rain. In the tense atmosphere, Pastor Liu also stood up, slowly and with a sense of sadness, he bowed to Cheng Yong.
1:2:17|1:2:33|After saying this, he turned and left. [Lv Shouyi] grabbed his hand, but couldn't stop him from leaving. [Lv Shouyi]'s face was filled with sadness and reluctance, and the glasses on his face couldn't hide the helplessness in his eyes. [Cheng Yong] rolled his eyes disdainfully, his expression grim.
1:2:35|1:2:44|The lively hotpot gathering was left with only two people, with [Lv Shouyi] pondering on what to say next. He put on a smiling face and looked at [Cheng Yong].
1:2:48|1:3:31|[Cheng Yong] bit his teeth coldly and said, [Lv Shouyi] froze with a ridiculous expression, almost instantly bursting into tears, but he didn't show a more distressed expression in front of [Cheng Yong]. He hurriedly packed up and left the shop, putting on his coat at the door. [Cheng Yong] lit a cigarette and started smoking. As he left, [Lv Shouyi] glanced back with reluctance and disbelief, but [Cheng Yong] ignored him. [Lv Shouyi], wearing a mask, was the last one to leave.
1:3:44|1:4:8|In the steaming hotpot restaurant, only Cheng Yong is left. People passing by with umbrellas each have their own thoughts. The rainy city night is particularly quiet, and the wet glass windows blur the city's night view.
1:4:51|1:4:59|[Cheng Yong] has opened a new textile factory and is becoming increasingly prosperous. One day, [Mrs. Lv] suddenly showed up, and even after a year, [Cheng Yong] recognized her at a glance.
1:6:0|1:6:45|[Cheng Yong] The rearview mirror in front of Cheng Yong reflected the despair of this woman. Cheng Yong's face was solemn, his emotions unreadable. In the late-night KTV, where singing and dancing were in full swing, Cheng Yong was the only one smoking one cigarette after another. Occasionally, he would clap along with everyone else, but his furrowed brow never relaxed.
1:6:45|1:7:52|Returning home at night, [Cheng Yong] searched for Indian Glivec on the computer. Seeing the search results, he frowned. Smuggling was caught, the case was cracked, the mastermind escaped, counterfeit drugs were produced, Indian Glivec was unreliable. He clicked on a piece of news about the seizure of pirated Indian Glivec, with the headline stating that the mastermind [Zhang Changlin] was being arrested. [Cheng Yong] looked at the wanted photo of [Zhang Changlin] on the computer screen with a complex expression. The black and white photo was the same face he had seen before, and the bright computer screen reflected [Cheng Yong]'s silent figure. The scene shifted to the hospital, where, in the soft call of his wife, [Lv Shouyi] weakly opened his eyes. He turned his head to see [Cheng Yong] sitting beside him, watching him. [Lv Shouyi] had an oxygen tank inserted, his eyes were bruised, his face was pale. He wore a cap to cover his bald head. They gazed at each other, and he suddenly chuckled.
1:7:54|1:8:7|Lv Shouyi lowered his head without saying a word, then turned around and pointed to the oranges on the bedside table. He gestured towards Cheng Yong, who remained silent and just looked at him. Lv Shouyi lowered his head.
1:8:10|1:8:39|[Lv Shouyi] finished speaking, [Cheng Yong] couldn't bear to look at him and [Lv Shouyi] followed [Cheng Yong] without saying a word. [Cheng Yong] and his wife were getting ready to leave. Before they left, [Cheng Yong] glanced back and saw [Lv Shouyi] biting a towel in his mouth. [Lv Shouyi] gestured for [Cheng Yong] to leave and not to look. [Cheng Yong] left the room with a pained expression.
1:8:39|1:9:20|Through the hospital room window, [Cheng Yong] saw the bloody wound on the lower right abdomen of [Lv Shouyi]. [Lv Shouyi], with one hand up, groaned in pain. The painful cries of [Lv Shouyi] made [Cheng Yong] unable to sit still outside the ward. [Mrs. Lv] wore a look of despair that she had long been accustomed to. The furrowed brow of [Cheng Yong] revealed his inner turmoil.
1:9:20|1:9:39|[Cheng Yong] left the hospital and walked through the tunnel, the bright lights in the tunnel shining on [Cheng Yong]. With a dark expression, he drove forward. [Cheng Yong] arrived at Pastor Liu's church, where Pastor Liu turned around in surprise as [Cheng Yong] stood at the door, watching him.
1:10:21|1:11:2|[Lv Shouyi], with a look of despair, is sent into the CT machine. As night falls and the moon hangs in the sky, [Lv Shouyi] lies on the hospital bed, his sparse hair revealing his scalp clearly. He lies weakly, suddenly seeming to see something. He shakily gets up, even thinner than the blanket covering him. He walks forward, supporting his waist wound, taking two steps and then resting, leaning on the table and gasping loudly. Turning around, he sees his wife and son lying on the ground, and smiles broadly.
1:11:15|1:12:1|[Cheng Yong] arrived in India and bought Indian Glivec at the pharmacy. He packed it up and prepared to walk out onto the street. With a serious and puzzled look, he glanced at the street, covering his lips with a handkerchief to block the smoke on the road as he walked forward. A statue of a lion goddess was being pushed towards him, and [Cheng Yong] looked at the statue thoughtfully. He walked quietly, followed closely by a statue from his home. The street was filled with smoke, and everyone covered their mouths and noses with handkerchiefs. The smoke, symbolizing death and rebirth, surrounded the statue of Shiva and the home statue, also foreshadowing the inner dilemma of [Cheng Yong].
1:12:46|1:12:52|A group of patients in hospital gowns are peering outside the restroom.
1:12:54|1:13:12|Lv Shouyi's portrait is placed in the center of the table, with candlesticks and two chrysanthemums on either side. Cheng Yong squats on the ground burning paper, while Mrs. Lv sits with her head bowed on the sofa. Cheng Yong takes out a white envelope from his bag and hands it to Mrs. Lv.
1:13:14|1:13:45|Pastor Liu and [Liu Sihui] stood silently on the side, while [Cheng Yong] looked lost and sorrowful. After a moment of silence, he walked out with a white envelope and a bag in his hands. The hallway was crowded with patients wearing masks, lining up to go inside one by one. [Cheng Yong] looked at the sadness on their faces, lowered his head, and squeezed through the crowd.
1:13:47|1:14:7|Shuttling through the crowd, [Cheng Yong] looked at the pairs of eyes waiting to be redeemed, lowering his head and unable to meet their gaze. But those eyes looking at him made him feel uneasy. He squeezed past one person after another, finally making his way through the long line.
1:14:18|1:14:41|Walking to the stairs, he heard sobbing and turned around to find [Huang Mao] sitting at the stairs, eating oranges and crying. [Cheng Yong] stared at [Huang Mao] intently, although his yellow hair partially covered his eyes, the stubbornness and regret in [Huang Mao]'s eyes were not hidden. [Cheng Yong] looked at him dazedly and then turned away.
1:15:11|1:15:39|[Cheng Yong] was smoking and thinking about what the drug dealer had said to him on the rooftop in India, "Don't worry, I can still provide you with what you need." The drug dealer placed his hand on his chest, making a promise to him. They locked eyes with each other.
1:15:41|1:15:56|At night, [Cheng Yong] pushed open the door and looked at his sleeping son. He placed the book that was left open by his son's pillow at the head of the bed, tucked him in tightly, and then turned off the light.
1:15:56|1:16:43|He quietly watched his sleeping son in the darkness. The slaughtered pigs were hanging in the pig farm. Cheng Yong arrived and saw Huang Mao eating a boxed meal. He walked up to him. Huang Mao stopped and looked at him, not saying a word. He then stuffed the food from the boxed meal into his mouth, finished eating, and threw the boxed meal into the nearby trash can. He stood up, walked towards Cheng Yong, leaned his face close to him and said something. Then he walked away, leaving Cheng Yong standing there at a loss. Cheng Yong then gathered the other patients.
1:17:14|1:17:49|Liu Sihui turned around in surprise, Cheng Yong alone carried box after box of medicine onto the truck, then turned around to continue, placing the next box on the steel plate. When he turned around again, he suddenly froze. Huang Mao was standing at the back of the truck. He walked over and took the medicine box from Cheng Yong's hand. Cheng Yong breathed a sigh of relief, looking at Huang Mao. They then continued to carry the boxes together, with the setting sun shining on the sea, and ships drifting in the distance.
1:17:50|1:17:57|[Huang Mao] sat on a stone stump with his knees hugged, and [Cheng Yong] walked over.
1:18:20|1:19:17|[Huang Mao] flashed a big toothy smile for the first time, looking silly at [Cheng Yong]. [Cheng Yong] glanced at [Huang Mao], who turned his face away. [Cheng Yong] stared at [Huang Mao] without saying a word, then withdrew his gaze. The two of them left the beach and slowly walked back in the sunset. They stopped at the dock where a security guard opened the truck's cover to inspect. [Huang Mao] walked over and patted the guard on the shoulder.
1:19:19|1:19:42|[Huang Mao] provocatively stared at the security guard, [Cheng Yong] pulled [Huang Mao] into the car and drove away, leaving the security guard rolling his eyes.
1:21:5|1:21:31|Cao Bin led the team to a leukemia support group, where they found Huang Mao's dilapidated shed. The police began a comprehensive search for the flow of fake medicine, working day and night to trace all possible sources. In Huang Mao's shed, the police found Indian Glivec, and they also discovered Indian Glivec on the leukemia support group patients.
1:21:36|1:21:49|The police confiscated all the fake medicines and took the patients to the police station. [Huang Mao] was also taken away by the police.
1:21:58|1:22:6|Everyone was gathered in a room by Cao Bin, who started to persuade them with his ideas.
1:22:39|1:22:57|Cao Bin finished speaking, but no one responded. Everyone sat quietly, not saying a word. An old lady stood up, took off her mask, and walked towards Cao Bin. Cao Bin responded by walking towards the old lady.
1:24:15|1:24:50|Cao Bin furrowed his brows, looking at the crying grandmother. The grandmother reached out and held his hand, watching him shed tears. Cao Bin ran to the restroom and splashed water on his face. His subordinate asked him what was wrong, Cao Bin turned off the tap, sighed, and nodded at his subordinate before walking out of the restroom. Cao Bin slowly raised his head and looked at himself in the mirror.
1:25:7|1:25:12|The chief glanced around and lowered his voice as he walked towards [Cao Bin].
1:25:22|1:25:36|Cao Bin stood there, ignoring the chief's command to move aside. He even stubbornly refused to budge his eyes, reluctantly making a little room.
1:25:52|1:26:17|[Cheng Yong] turned off the interview of the Swiss pharmaceutical representative on TV, he stubbed out his cigarette in the ashtray, started the car and just as he was about to leave, he saw a person standing in front of his car. The person walked towards him and knocked on his car door.
1:26:20|1:26:50|He rolled down the car window, the person showed his face, it was [Zhang Changlin]. [Cheng Yong] returned to the room, took out a stack of money from the safe, after saying that, [Cheng Yong] walked to the desk, lit a cigarette and smoked.
1:27:15|1:27:48|Zhang Changlin sneered, holding a plastic bag full of money as he left Cheng Yong's textile factory. Late at night, Zhang Changlin sat alone in a hotel room, opening a bottle of beer and eating a boxed meal. Outside the door, a rejected hotel attendant looked towards Cao Bin and the police. Cao Bin nodded at him.
1:27:48|1:28:29|[Cao Bin] heard a noise and immediately kicked open the door of the room. The police rushed in with guns, only to find the room empty with open windows. They immediately chased after Zhang Changlin who was running downstairs. [Cao Bin] and the group of police split up and took different actions. [Cao Bin] drove to chase after Zhang Changlin. In the alley, Zhang Changlin limped away. He knocked over a fruit stand to block the police. Just as Zhang Changlin was about to evade the pursuit, at that moment...
1:28:30|1:28:43|Cao Bin's car hit Zhang Changlin, who sat expressionless in the interrogation room, looking dazed.
1:28:50|1:29:0|The interrogating police officer signaled to his colleague, who took out a cigarette box from his pocket, pulled out a cigarette, walked over to him and handed it to Zhang Changlin. Zhang Changlin, with his hands handcuffed, awkwardly accepted the cigarette.
1:29:3|1:29:9|After the police lit it for him, Zhang Changlin leaned back in his chair, enjoying the cigarette in the interrogation room.
1:30:22|1:30:30|The chief was angered by Zhang Changlin in the office and stormed off. Late at night, Cao Bin was still reviewing cases at the police station.
1:30:34|1:30:52|[Cao Bin] lit a cigarette and searched through case reports in the smoke-filled office. He carefully flipped through each page, inspecting them one by one with a furrowed brow, but couldn't unravel the mystery of the case.
1:30:54|1:31:2|He flipped through the documents and came across a report. The interrogation records in the report caught his attention, and he glanced through them.
1:31:6|1:31:21|The final signature on the record reads two words, [Cheng Yong].
1:32:25|1:32:38|[Cao Bin] quietly watched as [Cheng Yong] smoked his cigar, then he turned away.
1:32:50|1:33:3|Cao Bin gave Cheng Yong a probing look, then turned and left. At dusk, Cheng Yong drove a truck and confronted Huang Mao. When Huang Mao got on the truck, Cheng Yong was so surprised that he couldn't speak. It turned out that Huang Mao had shaved his head.
1:33:12|1:33:36|[Cheng Yong] squinted his eyes while smoking, looking at [Huang Mao]. Then the two of them went to the dock to pick up a new batch of goods. [Huang Mao] had just come out of the restroom.
1:33:50|1:33:55|[Huang Mao] quickly ran to [Cheng Yong]'s side, but the place was too big, and he ran for a long time.
1:33:58|1:34:14|[Cheng Yong] is packing up the goods when he sees [Huang Mao] coming over and giving him a puzzled look. [Cheng Yong] looks at the sweaty [Huang Mao] and asks, "What's wrong?" [Huang Mao] gasps for breath, looks at [Cheng Yong], and then suddenly smiles and says,
1:34:17|1:34:56|[Cheng Yong] turned around and locked the door of the cargo hold. With a smile, [Huang Mao] looked at [Cheng Yong]. After locking the door, [Cheng Yong] realized that [Huang Mao] had driven the car away. Watching [Huang Mao] drive the car in a zigzag manner from behind, [Cheng Yong] firmly drove the car forward, passing through several cargo holds. Finally, he stopped Cao Bin and the police who were coming. [Cheng Yong] looked ahead with a puzzled face. [Huang Mao] made a provocative gesture towards Cao Bin, indicating him to catch up. This gesture angered Cao Bin, who turned on the siren in the car. Then the two started a chase on the road.
1:34:57|1:35:22|[Cheng Yong] looked calm as he watched everything in front of him without moving. [Huang Mao] was driving fast, with the police car in hot pursuit. Just as they were about to catch up, [Huang Mao] made a sharp turn, closely followed by the police car. Cao Bin had a determined look on his face. The headlights illuminated the entire dock. [Huang Mao] nervously watched the police car behind him, driving the car into a narrow alley between the cargo containers, with the police car right behind.
1:35:48|1:36:3|[Huang Mao] stepped on the gas and accelerated forward, rushing towards the entrance, crashing into the gate and police car. Cao Bin stopped the car, watching [Huang Mao] drive away. [Huang Mao] looked back and smiled when he saw the police car stop, but the next moment...
1:36:6|1:36:9|A massive truck crashed into [Huang Mao].
1:36:13|1:37:26|The medicine box fell out, with pills scattered on the ground. The white medicine box and the black asphalt road intertwined into a scene. Cao Bin, with blood all over his head, rushed towards the hospital with [Huang Mao], trembling as he held him, but couldn't help but fall. Cao Bin quickly helped [Huang Mao] up, watching him sit on the ground. The doctor hurriedly pushed the mobile bed over, took [Huang Mao] from Cao Bin's hands, and Cao Bin watched as [Huang Mao] was taken away, standing there motionless. Cheng Yong rushed over from the stairs, frantically searching in the hospital. Finally, he saw Cao Bin and the others. Cao Bin looked at him for a long time without saying a word.
1:37:58|1:38:22|Cheng Yong sat on the ground, gasping for breath with wide eyes. He arrived at the morgue, where the doctor uncovered the shroud. He stared blankly at Huang Mao in the morgue, as the doctor handed him the belongings. He looked sadly at the transparent bag containing only 50 yuan, an ID card, and a few pills.
1:38:22|1:38:58|At night, [Cheng Yong] arrived at the shabby shack of [Huang Mao]. He sat on [Huang Mao]'s bed, looking around at everything in the shack with sadness and regret in his eyes. He picked up the family photo on the table and examined it carefully before putting it back. Then he picked up the train ticket on the table, looked at the words printed on it, and finally couldn't help but burst into tears.
1:39:21|1:39:48|Huang Mao's puppy lay on the ground, the city at night still brightly lit, the flowers on the balcony showing signs of withering in the morning, raindrops that had not stopped all night pitter-pattered into the tub, forming ripples, the gloomy weather making Shanghai's daytime dim.
1:41:20|1:41:44|[Liu Sihui] is asking questions in an online patient group. He tells everyone that there is a large amount of Indian generic Glivec being sold at cost price, with the same efficacy as the genuine product. One patient after another sees the news online, and in different places, different families are all looking at the computer screen with hopeful eyes.
1:42:14|1:42:24|Sentence after sentence of thanks popping up on the screen, one "I need" after another popping out of the chat box, [Liu Sihui] looked at all of this with tears in her eyes.
1:42:33|1:42:41|In front of the screen, the messages are one by one of gratitude, one by one of seeking help, one by one with the hope of survival saying "I want to buy".
1:43:12|1:43:18|Liu Sihui took the thick stack of orders from Cheng Yong's hand and left his office.
1:43:20|1:43:34|[Cheng Yong] looked at the textile factory outside the office that had stopped operating. The next day, [Cheng Yong] took his son's hand and arrived at the airport.
1:43:47|1:44:55|The son held onto [Cheng Yong] tightly and wouldn't let go. [Cao Bin] watched this scene beside them, the son waved to [Cao Bin] and then followed the flight attendant to leave his father step by step. [Cao Bin] patted [Cheng Yong] on the shoulder, as [Cheng Yong] wiped away tears and left the airport, leaving [Cao Bin] looking puzzled. As night fell, [Cheng Yong] drove a van into an alley. A group of people wearing masks against the wall immediately stood up and approached the car. Fully armed with two hats, [Cheng Yong] got out of the car and distributed the drugs.
1:45:0|1:45:37|[Cheng Yong] immediately got on the van and placed it horizontally. He alone stopped the police car. The police got off the car with guns. Seeing the patients walking away, [Cheng Yong] slowly got off the van, holding his head with both hands. Watching the patients go away holding their heads, the police pushed [Cheng Yong] down and subdued him. Suddenly, he saw the patients being caught as well. He struggled and struggled to get up.
1:46:46|1:46:55|In the courtroom, Liu Sihui, Pastor Liu, Cao Bin, and Lv Shouyi nervously look at Cheng Yong as he slowly stands up.
1:47:50|1:47:57|[Cheng Yong] was put on the escort vehicle, with [Cao Bin] standing behind him, hands in his pockets, watching. [Cheng Yong] turned around and said to him,
1:48:0|1:48:10|Cheng Yong walked towards the escort vehicle after seeing Cao Bin nod.
1:48:12|1:48:35|The escort vehicle left the court, [Cao Bin] stood still and watched. As the escort vehicle drove onto the street in front of the court, the police suddenly widened their eyes, looked at [Cheng Yong], and said to their colleagues,
1:48:38|1:49:4|Cheng Yong, with his head down, slowly lifted his head due to the bumps, and he saw a shocking scene - the streets were filled with patients wearing masks.
1:49:30|1:50:46|On both sides of the street, the patients disregarded the bacteria, everyone took off their masks and silently watched the escort vehicle. [Cheng Yong] looked at these people with tears in his eyes. Among them were Pastor Liu, Liu Sihui, Liu Sihui's daughter, Lv Shouyi's wife, and Huang Mao's wife. Each person took off their mask and silently watched him. [Cheng Yong] turned away, no longer looking out the window, leaning against the car, holding back the tears.
1:51:8|1:51:21|This case has attracted high attention from government departments. [Cheng Yong] was granted a sentence reduction and released early. The government continues to promote healthcare system reform, and a large number of chronic myeloid leukemia patients have been effectively helped.
1:51:23|1:51:42|Three years later, Cheng Yong was released from prison. Cao Bin stood by the car, waiting for Cheng Yong to come out. After getting in the car, he handed him a pack of cigarettes.
