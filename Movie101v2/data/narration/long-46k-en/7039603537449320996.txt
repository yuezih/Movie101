0:1:29|0:1:54|[Sun Wukong] gnawed on a crispy peach in his hand, then tossed it out. The peach spun rapidly and hit Li Tianwang, sending him somersaulting in mid-air. The giant Ling Shen, as tall as the sky, rose up and swung his divine axe down towards [Sun Wukong]. He focused his gaze, but [Sun Wukong] was nowhere to be seen.
0:1:54|0:2:1|He was just about to lift his head when he was kicked down by [Sun Wukong] descending from the sky, [Sun Wukong] spiraled up in the air.
0:2:2|0:2:20|Nezha aimed his Red Tassel Spear directly at [Sun Wukong], but only grazed the Golden Cudgel and his armor. Nezha rode on the Wind Fire Wheels, holding the Red Tassel Spear, engaging in a mid-air battle with [Sun Wukong]. The Chi Guo Heavenly King plucked the strings of his pipa, causing [Sun Wukong] to be immediately knocked back by the sound waves. The Broad Eye Heavenly King released the green snake coiled around him,
0:2:20|0:2:31|The giant snake opened its bloody mouth and pounced towards [Sun Wukong], but was thrown off the cloud by him. Erlang Shen saw this, drew his bow, and shot a golden arrow into the sky, causing an instant explosion. However, [Sun Wukong] leaped down from the clouds.
0:2:31|0:2:49|Transformed into a red fish. Erlang Shen immediately gestured with his fingers, waved his arms, transformed into a white-browed eagle, flew over several heavenly kings, rushed into the clouds, and grabbed towards the red fish with his two eagle claws. The red fish jumped out of the clouds, turned into a swallow, and narrowly escaped from the eagle claws.
0:2:50|0:3:8|General Li ordered a thousand arrows to pierce through the clouds and shoot towards [Sun Wukong]. [Sun Wukong]'s pupils contracted sharply, turning into a ball of fire, blasting the heavenly soldiers and generals in the clouds. He then grabbed General Li's beard and threw him down to the mortal world.
0:3:10|0:3:20|Buddhist scripture seals the wrist of [Sun Wukong], and he is struck down from the Heavenly Palace by the palm of the Tathagata.
0:3:33|0:3:40|The mother bent down to kiss the baby in her arms, while the father stood up and watched the convoy.
0:3:52|0:4:9|On the steep mountain road, there is a continuous convoy of vehicles. The wooden cart with the baby hits a rock, almost falling off the cliff. The mother holds the baby tightly. A mountain demon climbs down.
0:4:13|0:4:15|The mountain demon pushed the people off the cliff. The mother held the baby and the cart driver turned back along the original path.
0:4:16|0:4:33|Unexpectedly, another mountain demon jumped down from the mountain on the opposite side. The mother screamed to protect the child in her arms, while the father was distracted by the child's crying. Seizing the opportunity, the mountain demon pounced, and the father raised his sword to meet it, slashing through the demon's chest. However, he was overwhelmed and knocked down by the successive attacks from the mountain demons.
0:4:34|0:4:49|The mother was about to run, but a mountain demon slowly climbed up in front of her, leaving her helpless and sitting paralyzed on the ground. The mountain demon gathered around from all directions, while her child innocently looked at her, holding a puppet of [Sun Wukong] in his hands. The mother looked up,
0:4:49|0:5:3|The father has died on the mountain road. With a frown on her face, she suddenly hugged the child and ran to the edge of the cliff, then leaped off. The mountain demons hurriedly reached out but caught nothing, and the mother and child fell into the misty bottom of the cliff.
0:5:3|0:5:21|In a valley, with lush vegetation, a river flows quietly between two mountains. Wearing a bamboo hat and long white beard, [Fa Ming] scoops up a handful of water by the river, when suddenly he hears the cry of a baby. Broken pieces of wood float on the river surface.
0:5:23|0:5:29|[Fa Ming] hurriedly walked into the river and picked up the baby in the basket.
0:5:31|0:5:54|The baby's saliva and snot sprayed all over [Fa Ming]'s face. [Fa Ming] held the baby in his arms and walked ashore. Looking back in the direction of the river's source, [Fa Ming] once again entered the deep and beautiful valley. The camera moved up.
0:5:56|0:6:17|Above the valley is a clear and calm sky, with the title "The Monkey King: The Hero Returns" appearing in the air. [Fa Ming] arrives at a mountain village and raises a baby to the guards on the gate tower for inquiry. After they gesture him away, he carries the baby on his back, leans on a cane, and traverses mountains and rivers. On a stormy night, [Fa Ming] takes shelter in a cave with the baby.
0:6:19|0:6:39|He lit a fire in the cave, dipping his fingers into the water in the iron pot next to him to feed the baby. As a blizzard approached, [Fa Ming] carried the baby on his back, facing the raging snowflakes, and walked laboriously on the snowy mountain. Everywhere his eyes could see was a vast expanse of white. A winding river flowed across the boundless fields.
0:6:42|0:6:59|The child happily welcomes the breeze, arms outstretched. In the dense forest, the child follows [Fa Ming] unsteadily, accidentally falling into the grass. [Fa Ming] quickly turns around to help him up, but the child gets up on his own and continues to walk unsteadily step by step.
0:6:59|0:7:10|Several years later, on a white curtain, a shadow play of [Sun Wukong] battling the Four Great Heavenly Kings is being performed.
0:7:32|0:7:54|[Jiang Liuer] broke free from the shadow puppeteer and quickly slipped away. In the evening of Chang'an City, as the lights gradually brightened, peach blossoms bloomed on the branches. [Jiang Liuer] painted Sun Wukong's face on the eaves and darted around. He accidentally kicked a stone that hit the uncle, causing his dentures to fly out and fall into the soup.
0:7:57|0:8:6|[Jiang Liuer] was playing with his staff, pointing it at a small yellow dog on the ground. He ran around with the staff, but accidentally bumped into [Fa Ming].
0:8:12|0:8:17|[Jiang Liuer] raised the bowl in her hand and the passerby cooperatively tossed a copper coin into it.
0:8:51|0:8:58|[Fa Ming] is dressed in tattered clothes, with a hole in his worn-out shoes.
0:9:42|0:9:58|A sudden thunderstorm arrived, and the city was suddenly filled with drum-like heavy rain. [Fa Ming] leaned on his cane and walked slowly down the stone bridge, while [Jiang Liuer] looked up at the sky, rainwater sliding down his face into his neck. The leaves glistened after the rain, with water droplets beating against the leaves and falling rapidly.
0:9:58|0:10:8|The insects chirped their wings, the leaves bent the branches and pierced into the calm river, and a giant claw shattered the current tranquility.
0:10:12|0:10:19|A volley of arrows fell from the sky, all stuck in the hillside not far away. The leading female mountain demon gave orders.
0:10:22|0:10:43|The demons around her rushed out instantly, knocking her left and right. The demons attacked the city wall, knocking down the archers behind, and another archer was slapped away by a demon's palm, crashing through the roof of a household. The parents in the house held their child tightly as the demon then burst in.
0:10:56|0:11:1|A mountain demon runs from the roof, holding a little girl in his left hand.
0:11:2|0:11:14|He was suddenly hit by a flowerpot, before he could react, he was hit by a pot of cactus. [Mountain Demon] saw Jiang Liuer upstairs, about to pounce, but was stunned by a door slamming shut.
0:11:17|0:11:24|[Fa Ming] was hit by Jiang Liuer's water bucket and fell to the ground, just as the little girl thrown by the Mountain Demon landed on him.
0:11:34|0:11:48|A large group of [Mountain Demons] followed behind them. The [Mountain Demons] jumped off the roof and climbed onto a stone lion. Jiang Liuer and the others were nowhere to be seen, but the stone ball the lion was stepping on turned into a trembling bald man. The [Mountain Demons] looked around.
0:11:48|0:11:55|Discovering another stone lion with three balls underneath, [Fa Ming] pushed over the stone lion when he saw Jiang Liuer exposed.
0:12:3|0:12:12|Jiang Liuer fled with the little girl in her arms, but several Mountain Demons crawled in front of them. She quickly turned into a narrow alley, and a Mountain Demon jumped down from above, only to fall into a bamboo basket.
0:12:12|0:12:28|Jiang Liuer ran on the flying bamboo raft, dodging the attacking [Mountain Demon], but then jumped down from the high bamboo basket above. He landed on the roof of the tile house below, slid down from the roof, and stopped at the eaves, with a bottomless valley beneath his feet.
0:12:28|0:12:39|The female [Mountain Demon] slid down, lifted up Jiang Liuer and the little girl, but the other [Mountain Demons] behind her didn't stop in time, knocking her off the roof. Suddenly, a tree barrel flew out of the valley.
0:12:39|0:12:54|[Jiang Liuer] is holding a little girl, sliding down the valley in a desolate village on a tree bucket. The mountain demon also rolls down from the hillside, sliding along the clothesline in the middle of the house, covered by a bright bedsheet, and crashes into a household.
0:12:54|0:13:13|The tree branch tore through the mountain demon's bedsheet-like clothing, causing him to fall to the ground, knocking over several bamboo baskets, one of which landed on [Jiang Liuer]'s head. Seizing the opportunity, the demon snatched the little girl but accidentally flung her away. [Jiang Liuer] slid through the air on a tree bucket, caught the girl in a bamboo basket, and then tumbled into a deeper valley.
0:13:13|0:13:32|The tree barrel continued to slide in the dark valley, with the mountain demons still in hot pursuit. [Jiang Liuer] stepped on the tree barrel and made a sharp turn at the edge of the cliff. A mountain demon, caught off guard, flew out of the cliff and bounced around on the towering stone pillars, accidentally knocking [Jiang Liuer] and the female mountain demon following closely behind into the abyss.
0:13:33|0:14:0|The mountain demon handed over a bamboo basket, but inside was a beehive. The female mountain demon angrily smashed her subordinates with the beehive, and they were immediately surrounded by bees, the two demons fled in panic. A firefly with a faint light flew out, illuminating a huge stone under the tree roots, on which lay the face of a stone statue.
0:14:0|0:14:9|A firefly flapped its wings and flew out of the valley, heading towards the distant mountains shaped like five fingers. [Fa Ming] looked around in the white mist.
0:14:14|0:14:35|The valley is quiet, with lush vegetation. A butterfly flutters away from the leaves. Resembling a squirrel, a land god with white beard emerges from the ground, looking up at the cliff. Five or six land gods follow [Jiang Liuer] as they climb up. [Jiang Liuer] struggles to carry the little girl up the hill, and the land gods see him coming up.
0:14:35|0:14:51|[Jiang Liuer] jumped forward. She looked up and saw a huge peach tree in front of her, full of celestial peaches. While looking, she noticed a peach on the ground, so she picked it up and put it in her basket. There were peaches all over the ground, and [Jiang Liuer] couldn't pick them all up.
0:14:51|0:15:12|Several land deities carried peaches to him. Behind him, a land deity carrying three peaches lost his balance and clumsily fell to the ground. The land deity beside him tried to throw the peaches into his basket but missed, causing the peaches to roll into a puddle, which turned out to be the footprint of a mountain demon. [Jiang Liuer] was so scared that she dropped the peaches in her arms and tumbled away.
0:15:12|0:15:17|Hundun hides under the ground, while the nearby treetops shake.
0:15:20|0:15:36|A mountain demon flew out from the tree, and [Jiang Liuer] quickly climbed up the peach tree. Peaches fell down one after another, blocking the demon's eyes. [Jiang Liuer] climbed up the tree and entered a stone cave next to the tree trunk. He turned back to pick up his lost shoe, but the demon scratched his hand with a claw.
0:15:36|0:15:56|Watching the mountain demon at the cave entrance, showing its teeth and claws but unable to enter, [Jiang Liuer] hurriedly put on her shoes and ran towards the depths of the cave. Carrying the little girl on her back, [Jiang Liuer] walked in the cave, step by step. The blood on her hand dripped onto the ground, shining a circle of blood light, spreading out in the cave.
0:15:59|0:16:19|[Jiang Liuer] suddenly stepped on empty space and slipped down. He stood up shakily, squinted his eyes and looked ahead, then took two steps forward. In front of him was a huge stone pillar emitting a dazzling cold light, the surface of the pillar was uneven and it was bound by iron chains all around.
0:16:19|0:16:41|In the cave, the stone walls are covered with Buddha statues. [Jiang Liuer] sticks a stone flower on one of the walls, takes a few steps back, and accidentally bumps into a palm print protruding from a stone pillar. The entire pillar is covered with scattered palm prints, and he places his hand against one of them. A muffled sound makes [Jiang Liuer] retract his hand, and he turns and walks forward.
0:16:41|0:16:55|The palm print cracked, spreading upwards and across the entire pillar. [Jiang Liuer] clasped her hands together in prayer before the Buddha statue, unaware that the pillar behind her was about to collapse.
0:16:55|0:17:4|The cracks rapidly spread across the Buddha statue, a iron chain broke and fell down, [Jiang Liuer] dodged and lay down, avoiding a disaster, the stone pillar instantly exploded.
0:17:10|0:17:24|Rocks kept collapsing, [Jiang Liuer] held the little girl and hid to the side, but soon got buried by the stones, everything fell silent. The cave was filled with dust, and the ground was covered with rocks and debris.
0:17:24|0:17:47|[Jiang Liuer] slowly got up, spat out saliva, and noticed the little girl in front of him. He quickly lifted the bamboo basket containing the little girl from the rocks. [Jiang Liuer] turned his head and saw several mountain demons crawling out from the cracks in the cave. He grabbed the bamboo basket and ran, with the female mountain demon quickly chasing after him.
0:17:47|0:18:8|[Jiang Liuer] ran to the place where the stone pillar exploded, jumped onto the iron chain, and climbed upwards. The iron chain swayed in the air, almost colliding with the mountain demon chasing from behind. Suddenly, a stone slab stood up from the pile of rocks, the mountain demon hit the stone slab firmly and fell backwards, rolling three times before falling to the ground. A hairy hand suddenly emerged from the pile of rocks.
0:18:8|0:18:19|Mao Shou grabbed a rock, propped himself up, and [Sun Wukong] climbed out of the pile of stones in tattered clothes. He stretched his neck, noticing the mountain demons around him.
0:18:23|0:18:37|[Sun Wukong] watched as the mountain demon pounced towards him, swiftly dodging to the side, causing the demon to crash into a rock. [Sun Wukong] realized that his hands were still chained, instantly feeling dumbfounded. The female mountain demon quickly flew towards him.
0:18:38|0:18:53|[Sun Wukong] kicked the stones off his body, causing the female mountain demon to be hit and spit flying everywhere. [Sun Wukong] jumped up and spun rapidly in the air, swinging his iron chain at the surrounding mountain demons, sending stones flying and hitting them against the rock wall.
0:18:53|0:19:7|[Sun Wukong] grinned and looked around, then turned to stare at [Jiang Liuer]. [Jiang Liuer] gripped the iron chain tightly, looking at him in fear, with snot running down her face. [Sun Wukong] was drawn to [Jiang Liuer]'s snot.
0:19:7|0:19:16|[Jiang Liuer] found that her snot had dripped onto her mouth, so she quickly sucked it back in. The little girl climbed out of the basket on her back and patted [Sun Wukong]'s monkey head.
0:19:17|0:19:34|[Sun Wukong] turned and walked away, raising his hand to retrieve the iron chain, only to be hit in the face by it. [Jiang Liuer]'s snot dripped down and landed right in the mouth of the mountain demon, who then licked his lips. [Jiang Liuer] quickly carried the little girl on her back and ran away, leaving the cave behind.
0:19:34|0:19:46|[Sun Wukong] is jumping around in the forest as if reborn. He slides on tree trunks, grabs branches to loop in the air, then instantly shoots out and flies towards the tallest tree in the jungle.
0:19:56|0:20:20|He looked proudly at the scenery of the entire valley, gazed at the dazzling sun in the distance, took a few steps for a run-up, and dashed towards the sky. [Sun Wukong]'s right hand seal suddenly lit up, and he fell from the sky. [Sun Wukong] rolled all the way and landed by a pond.
0:20:20|0:20:33|He held down his glowing right hand, picked up a stone, and smashed it towards the right hand's seal, but the seal remained unaffected. [Sun Wukong] became furious and crazily smashed the rocks with his right hand, causing sparks to fly.
0:20:33|0:20:50|[Jiang Liuer] heard a noise and hid nearby to observe [Sun Wukong]. [Sun Wukong] saw the reflection on [Fa Ming]'s body and realized that behind him was the statue of the Buddha, he smirked and stood up.
0:21:19|0:21:31|[Jiang Liuer] hurried to catch up, but didn't know which direction [Sun Wukong] had gone. A land god with a cherry in its mouth gestured to him, and [Jiang Liuer] turned around to bow.
0:21:32|0:21:44|The Earth God watched as [Jiang Liuer] walked away, measured the land with his foot, then leaped up and disappeared into the underworld, leaving behind a cloud of white smoke. [Jiang Liuer] followed closely behind.
0:21:46|0:22:2|He struggled to climb over the moss-covered tree stump, [Sun Wukong] saw this and quickly hid behind a big tree, chuckling to himself. [Sun Wukong] glanced at [Jiang Liuer], who was carrying a little girl on her back with two small braids on her head.
0:22:3|0:22:9|[Jiang Liuer] and [Sun Wukong] walked side by side, holding onto the back rope, and asked,
0:22:15|0:22:33|[Sun Wukong] quickly jumped onto the small hill behind him. [Jiang Liuer] looked around, while [Sun Wukong] gazed in surprise at the surrounding roads.
0:23:1|0:23:8|[Sun Wukong] listened contentedly, with his hands folded behind his head.
0:23:40|0:23:49|[Sun Wukong] lost control and punched down the big tree next to him.
0:24:8|0:24:28|Suddenly, behind the two, there was the sound of rocks rolling down the mountain, followed by a violent shaking of the earth. [Sun Wukong] stared intently at the forest behind him, clenching his fists. A massive stone giant soared into the air,
0:24:29|0:24:33|His roar echoed through the valley, startling a group of forest birds.
0:25:10|0:25:28|[Mountain God] descended from the sky, blocking his way, leaping on the ground, and delivering a heavy blow to him. [Sun Wukong] agilely leaped around, but was punched into a huge rock by [Mountain God], who then swung his fist over. [Sun Wukong] jumped onto [Mountain God]'s head and a flashy kick sent him rolling far away.
0:25:28|0:25:37|[Sun Wukong] clenched his fist in excitement, while [Fa Ming] suddenly emitted a bright light and fell to the ground in pain. A huge rock fell from the canyon, narrowly missing [Jiang Liuer].
0:25:38|0:25:59|He ran behind the rock next to [Sun Wukong] to hide. The stones on the ground rolled and gathered on the right fist of [Mountain God]. [Mountain God] lifted the just fallen huge rock, [Sun Wukong] looked at the sky-obscuring huge rock in confusion, fortunately dodged in time, [Sun Wukong] flipped over and avoided the left fist of [Mountain God].
0:26:0|0:26:9|He was hit by the Mountain God in mid-air and rolled tens of meters away. Sun Wukong grabbed the nearby rocks, stood up, and shook off the dust from his body.
0:26:12|0:26:30|The Mountain God pushed aside the blocking stones and charged towards Sun Wukong like a hungry beast. Sun Wukong quickly leaped left and right among the rocks in the canyon, then jumped back to the ground, running forward on all fours. Ahead was a cliff, and Sun Wukong leaped off it.
0:26:30|0:26:49|He hooked the thick branches on the cliff edge with an iron chain, broke the branches and leaped into the air. [Sun Wukong] sat on the back of the [Mountain God], who suddenly became irritable. He turned and ran towards a steep cliff, smashing his back against the rock wall. [Sun Wukong] agilely jumped away as the [Mountain God] chased after him and pushed him to the edge of the cliff.
0:26:49|0:27:9|[Sun Wukong] uses both hands to block the right fist of [Mountain God]. [Jiang Liuer] sees the talisman fluttering behind [Mountain God], he takes off the bamboo basket on his back with the little girl inside, and instructs, [Jiang Liuer] runs a little way, jumps onto the back of [Mountain God], and reaches out to grab the talisman within reach.
0:27:9|0:27:16|[Mountain God] noticed a little something on his body and turned to look at it. Seeing the opportunity, [Sun Wukong] immediately released his hands.
0:27:17|0:27:35|[Mountain God] and [Jiang Liuer] fell off the cliff together. Just as [Sun Wukong] was about to leave, he was pulled down by an iron chain. [Mountain God] grabbed the iron chain of [Sun Wukong] and climbed up, leaving [Sun Wukong] hanging on the cliff edge with just a vine. Suddenly, [Mountain God] anxiously twisted his body, and [Jiang Liuer] climbed up his back.
0:27:37|0:27:44|[Jiang Liuer] held up the freshly torn talisman, causing the entire body of [Mountain God] to tremble violently.
0:27:47|0:28:8|The Mountain God exploded into countless pieces of rubble, falling into the abyss, and Jiang Liuer also fell down the cliff. In the rugged valley, snow and wind intertwined, with howling cold winds. The mountain tunnel led to a huge and incomparable cave, where four bruised and swollen mountain demons were lying on the huge tree roots that pierced through the rocks in front of them.
0:28:8|0:28:15|It's the demon king [Hundun].
0:28:30|0:28:37|Hundun waved his sleeve, and the reflections of two mountain demons on the rock wall turned into a man and a woman.
0:28:38|0:28:51|[Jiang Liuer] woke up coughing, grabbing the two sharp teeth of the unknown creature in front of him with both hands. He opened his eyes and was scared away by the big mouth in front of him. It turned out to be a big fish being roasted over the fire.
0:29:21|0:29:36|[Jiang Liuer] leaned against the giant rock, [Sun Wukong] winced in pain and quickly tore off a piece of fish to chew, trying to distract himself. He noticed [Jiang Liuer] looking at him, so he handed the meat over.
0:29:58|0:30:15|[Sun Wukong]'s foot swelled twice its size. [Jiang Liuer] kicked away the stones by his feet, causing them to skip across the lake surface and fly far away. He kicked another one, and that stone unexpectedly spiraled towards [Sun Wukong]. [Sun Wukong] reached out and caught it, only for the huge rock to hit his foot again.
0:30:17|0:30:24|[Jiang Liuer] punched the boulder, causing [Sun Wukong] to jump up in pain, only able to tremble and ask,
0:30:34|0:30:46|The little girl climbed onto the roasted fish's belly, [Jiang Liuer] stepped on the branch holding the vine, a huge rock fell to the ground, [Sun Wukong] was bounced into the air and fell heavily, hanging on the tree trunk.
0:30:54|0:31:5|Suddenly, a figure flashed behind [Jiang Liuer]. He turned at the sound, carefully weaving through the tree trunks, and discovered a temple built on a stone platform.
0:31:7|0:31:24|[Sun Wukong] grimaced in pain as he covered his ears. [Jiang Liuer] pushed open the temple door, revealing a temple covered in cobwebs. Curiously, he stepped inside, his small feet kicking up dust on the ground. Light filtered through the cracks in the roof, illuminating the dust particles in the air. The colorful deity statues in the temple seemed to come alive with menacing expressions.
0:31:24|0:31:42|Looking at the ground, it seems like [Jiang Liuer] is staring at the sudden intruder. [Jiang Liuer] looks up in awe at the statue above, accidentally kicking over the candlestick on the ground. He picks up the candlestick and walks towards the offering table. On the table is a statue of Maitreya Buddha with one hand raised in a gesture of respect. [Jiang Liuer] places the candlestick next to the Buddha statue.
0:31:42|0:31:54|Seeing that the offering table was covered in dust, he blew on it, causing dust to fly everywhere. Suddenly, the Buddha statue showed signs of movement, and Maitreya Buddha burst out of the door.
0:32:2|0:32:9|Maitreya Buddha's eyes rolled around, and he resorted to a trick, chanting a spell, [Sun Wukong] quickly stood up to confront him.
0:32:14|0:32:29|After chanting the mantra, Maitreya Buddha remained motionless. Suddenly, the eyeballs of the fish he was roasting jumped out, and a little girl popped out, startling Maitreya Buddha who fell down. The girl landed on him and laughed even more joyfully. [Jiang Liuer] approached, only to find Maitreya Buddha.
0:32:29|0:32:40|He turned into a pig's nose, then pig ears popped out of his head, completely transforming into a pig demon wearing a small vest. When he saw the grilled fish, he immediately pounced on it and devoured it ravenously.
0:33:5|0:33:14|Sun Wukong looked at Marshal Tianpeng [Zhu Bajie] with a disdainful expression. [Zhu Bajie] jumped up in place, slapped his knees vigorously, landed and struck a pose, then said,
0:33:16|0:33:31|Just as he approached Sun Wukong, his nostrils were pinched by Wukong's two fingers. Wukong hooked his nose and swung half a circle towards the big tree, awakening Zhu Bajie's memory in an instant. History always has astonishing similarities.
0:33:31|0:33:40|Back then, he transformed into Li Tianwang and was struck down to the mortal world by Sun Wukong, falling into a pigsty in the mountain village, turning into a little piglet and being nudged around by the big pig.
0:33:57|0:34:12|Sun Wukong looked at the snot on his hand, [Zhu Bajie] covered his nose in horror. Seeing Sun Wukong leaving, he looked back and forth a few times. [Zhu Bajie] shouted loudly, while [Jiang Liuer] stared at him with wide eyes. The scene was awkward for a moment.
0:35:4|0:35:15|The pointed-eared chubby cat is running in the forest, with [Jiang Liuer] panting behind carrying a little girl on her back. Despite its round shape, the chubby cat runs fast enough to give [Jiang Liuer] a hard time catching up.
0:35:15|0:35:34|It occasionally glanced back at [Jiang Liuer], suddenly made a sharp turn at the edge of a bush. The fat cat was panting heavily, but quickly resumed its sniffing state. It ran a few steps, lifted its leg to urinate near a tree root, only to see Sun Wukong's back ahead. The fat cat acted cleverly, and the urine splashed at [Jiang Liuer]'s feet.
0:35:34|0:35:41|The fat cat tried to slip away, but was pulled back by [Jiang Liuer].
0:35:46|0:35:51|[Jiang Liuer] is holding a tree branch in her hand.
0:36:26|0:36:38|Sun Wukong couldn't bear to look at the strange-eyed Jiang Liuer who appeared out of nowhere, covering his eyes and shaking his head. Jiang Liuer poked the big belly of this new companion.
0:36:39|0:36:47|Jiang Liuer, with a big belly, transformed into Zhu Bajie with a breath, and was bounced away by him, rolling all the way to the edge of a cliff.
0:36:49|0:36:55|He suddenly sensed something was wrong, looked back in fear, and saw a white dragon hovering in the air, staring at him.
0:36:58|0:37:11|Sun Wukong saw the dragon perched on the mountaintop, with a horse head, deer antlers, fish scales, and snake body. He rushed towards Jiang Liuer as the dragon swooped down, pushing the dragon's head and causing the white dragon to roll over several times.
0:37:12|0:37:28|The white dragon slowly raised its body, circled around [Sun Wukong], and then looked down at [Sun Wukong] with unparalleled dominance. [Jiang Liuer] and [Zhu Bajie] ran over, [Sun Wukong] hurriedly stopped them, while the white dragon stared at [Sun Wukong] intently, then suddenly let out a dragon roar.
0:37:28|0:37:34|A squid leg slapped [Sun Wukong]'s face, a starfish stuck to [Zhu Bajie]'s head. The white dragon turned its head towards [Jiang Liuer],
0:37:37|0:37:49|[Jiang Liuer], who was helping [Zhu Bajie] pull the starfish, immediately stood still. The white dragon's huge claws shattered the ground, sending rocks flying. It stared at [Sun Wukong] for a moment, then suddenly turned around and flew towards the valley.
0:37:57|0:38:7|[Jiang Liuer] fearfully covered her face with her arms, tears streaming down. Upon seeing this, [Sun Wukong] immediately turned to [Zhu Bajie].
0:38:25|0:38:32|In the midst of speaking, the White Dragon rushed out of the valley, circled in the air for a moment, and then flew out of the valley like a fish swimming in water.
0:38:38|0:38:50|[Sun Wukong] left [Zhu Bajie] behind and followed [Jiang Liuer]. [Zhu Bajie] sat there looking disdainful, while [Jiang Liuer] carried the little girl on her back and climbed up the hill by the sea, watching from afar.
0:41:5|0:41:9|[Fa Ming] faced the setting sun, dragging the crocodile that was tightly biting onto him, moving forward with difficulty.
0:41:9|0:41:26|[Sun Wukong] and his companions walked out of the woods. [Jiang Liuer] marched forward, suddenly spotting a house ahead. She quickened her pace and [Zhu Bajie] followed, excited for food. Meanwhile, [Sun Wukong] stayed behind, quietly turning back the way they came, taking a bite of the peach in his hand.
0:41:46|0:41:53|The [Boss Lady] with a fairy bun hairstyle lifted the kitchen door curtain and walked towards the front door. She smoothed her hair and adjusted her chest.
0:42:6|0:42:12|[Zhu Bajie] rushed into the kitchen in a hurry, and the shopkeeper quickly plunged into the water tank. [Zhu Bajie] lifted his butt and sat right on the tank opening.
0:42:16|0:42:37|[Sun Wukong] jumped onto the door panel, pressing down [Boss Lady] who was about to speak. He leaped onto the table, took the teapot, and jumped onto the second-floor railing. With a stretch of his hand, the teapot lid fell perfectly onto the teapot. [Zhu Bajie] walked out of the kitchen with a relaxed face, then hurried over to the chili peppers hanging on the wall. In the kitchen's water tank, the waiter climbed out with a lump of feces on his head.
0:42:37|0:42:44|[Jiang Liuer] heard the sound and asked, the shopkeeper lifted the door curtain and walked out, [Jiang Liuer] asked,
0:43:22|0:43:30|[Sun Wukong] jumps down from upstairs and stands in front of [Boss Lady], while [Zhu Bajie] on the side rolls on the ground in pain from eating chili peppers, licking the floor tiles.
0:43:54|0:44:4|[Zhu Bajie] stared at [Boss Lady], his eyes wide open. [Sun Wukong] deliberately threw the teapot to [Zhu Bajie].
0:44:8|0:44:22|[Sun Wukong] stepped on [Zhu Bajie]'s back and jumped to the second floor. Seeing [Jiang Liuer] walking away, [Boss Lady] looked at the little girl maliciously, but suddenly [Sun Wukong] blocked her line of sight.
0:44:22|0:44:32|[Boss Lady] exited the guest room, and when [Zhu Bajie] saw her coming out, he quickly sucked in his belly and made way. [Boss Lady] climbed down the ladder and bumped into the waiter.
0:44:39|0:44:54|[Zhu Bajie] made all kinds of funny faces at the little girl, but she kept crying. [Zhu Bajie] furrowed his brows, stuck out his tongue to lick his own nostrils, but was pulled away by [Sun Wukong]. [Jiang Liuer] took out a puppet.
0:44:59|0:45:16|The little girl entered dreamland with a smile, [Zhu Bajie] and [Jiang Liuer] both yawning, while [Sun Wukong] nibbled on a peach and leaped onto the window of the room. One eye peeked through the hole in the wooden door to spy inside the room, a fly flew in, [Sun Wukong] threw a clay pot hitting it, also hitting the waiter peeking outside.
0:45:23|0:45:39|The shopkeeper was hanging upside down on the railing on the second floor, and [Boss Lady] looked very disdainful. [Boss Lady] walked into the courtyard and stealthily approached the door of another wooden house. The wooden house was tall, with a thick layer of hay piled on the roof. In the guest room, [Sun Wukong] rested his hands on his head, leaning against the window lost in thought.
0:45:39|0:45:46|[Jiang Liuer] on the bed turned over, opened her eyes, and saw [Sun Wukong] shaking his leg boredly by the window.
0:46:28|0:46:42|[Jiang Liuer] sat dejectedly on the edge of the bed. [Zhu Bajie] immediately felt greedy and licked his lips eagerly.
0:46:53|0:47:2|[Sun Wukong] was speaking when he raised his hand and saw the seal on his wrist, instantly quieting down.
0:47:28|0:47:37|[Jiang Liuer] on the bed has fallen asleep soundly. He gently averted his gaze, then looked back at his dharma seal, feeling helpless as he gazed up at the sky.
0:47:41|0:47:57|The door of the guest room quietly opened and closed again, [Sun Wukong] at the window with his arms crossed, head lowered as if in deep sleep. [Zhu Bajie] crawled out of the room, swiftly wriggling to the staircase. Just as his pig hoof stepped on the ladder, it broke the rung.
0:47:58|0:48:20|Sitting on the ground, perking up his ears, looking around, and then happily running off. Unexpectedly, the shop assistant was standing in the dark with a rake. [Zhu Bajie] squeezed into the kitchen, sniffing around with his nose. He came to the bottles and jars placed against the wall, opened the lids one by one to check, and finally found some chestnuts in the jar in the middle.
0:48:20|0:48:38|He stuck out his tongue, rolled up the chestnuts, but got stuck in the bottle neck. The shopkeeper raised a nail rake behind him, [Zhu Bajie] suddenly saw [Boss Lady] passing by the window. In a panic, he quickly pulled out his tongue and knocked the shopkeeper unconscious on the ground. [Boss Lady] pushed open the door, and there was no one in the kitchen.
0:48:38|0:48:46|She walked quickly into the room, and behind the door, [Zhu Bajie] was ready to slip away. The [Boss Lady] suddenly turned around, and [Zhu Bajie] had already transformed into a waiter.
0:48:48|0:48:55|[Boss Lady] closed the door, and the real shop assistant fell down. [Boss Lady] looked suspiciously at [Zhu Bajie].
0:49:0|0:49:9|[Boss Lady] walked towards the hall, [Zhu Bajie] tried to slip away. [Zhu Bajie] quickly stood in front of the waiter, perfectly imitating his tongue-sticking-out gesture.
0:49:12|0:49:23|Boss Lady tried to take Zhu Bajie away, but she grabbed the hand of the waiter and dragged him forward without looking back. Zhu Bajie wanted to slip away, but he turned around and followed her. He kicked the waiter away and sat next to Boss Lady.
0:49:45|0:49:52|[Zhu Bajie] walked towards the door covering his mouth, but as soon as he lifted the door curtain, he was pulled back by [Boss Lady].
0:49:55|0:50:10|[Zhu Bajie] tried to break free from [Boss Lady] and leave, but she pulled him back. [Boss Lady] held [Zhu Bajie]'s face, and his human face turned into a pig face.
0:50:11|0:50:32|Outside the door, a monkey's foot flew in, kicking [Boss Lady] out of the inn's door. [Sun Wukong] was about to step forward, but found the ground covered in moonlight. Looking up, he saw the roof had been lifted, with [Hundun] standing on the central wooden pole of the inn, a huge vortex engulfing the sky.
0:50:32|0:50:39|Around the inn, multiple formations appeared, and dozens of mountain demons were transported over, heading towards [Sun Wukong]. [Jiang Liuer] walked out of the guest room.
0:50:41|0:50:56|[Jiang Liuer] quickly returned to the room and closed the door. The mountain demons swarmed towards the stairs, but were knocked out by [Sun Wukong]. [Sun Wukong] swung one of the demons away, and when a demon flew towards [Zhu Bajie], he immediately transformed into a fly to dodge. Just as he narrowly escaped, he was swallowed by the demon.
0:50:58|0:51:8|The mountain demon burped, spitting out a fly that transformed into [Zhu Bajie] with a buzz, knocking over the wooden table. The bruised [Boss Lady] sneaked into the room and hid behind a pillar.
0:51:8|0:51:26|Observing in secret. Taking advantage of the intense battle in the guest hall, she quietly climbed upstairs and was about to move towards the guest room when two mountain demons that had been knocked flying pierced through the second-floor floor and got stuck under her feet. In the guest room, [Jiang Liuer] was leaning against the door, breathing heavily, while a little girl lay on a cool mat, holding a cloth doll of [Sun Wukong] and sleeping soundly.
0:51:26|0:51:46|[Boss Lady] with a murderous look in her eyes lunged forward, [Jiang Liuer] held the little girl and hid under the table, kicking and struggling against [Boss Lady]. [Boss Lady] lifted the table, and [Jiang Liuer] smashed the table leg onto her foot. Upon hearing the screams, [Sun Wukong] immediately shook off the mountain demon and leaped to the second floor.
0:51:46|0:52:0|Another mountain demon pounced on him, only to be knocked into the wall by him. [Sun Wukong] leaped around in the hall, grabbed a pillar and swung it around, kicking away the approaching mountain demon, which crashed into a pile of mountain demons in the corner like a bowling ball. [Sun Wukong] then jumped upstairs,
0:52:0|0:52:13|Being knocked down by the mountain demon again, he shouted towards [Zhu Bajie], [Sun Wukong] smashed the mountain demon on him, [Zhu Bajie] spun and flew towards the second floor, but got stuck on the railing, a mountain demon pounced on his buttocks.
0:52:14|0:52:25|In the guest room, [Jiang Liuer] took advantage of [Boss Lady] lifting the table to sneak out from between her legs with the little girl in her arms. Just as [Boss Lady] chased out the door, she was knocked over by [Zhu Bajie] sliding over, crashing through the outer wall and flying out of the inn.
0:52:26|0:52:31|[Sun Wukong] was pinned to the corner by the mountain demon, and the surrounding mountain demons swarmed in.
0:52:34|0:52:44|[Jiang Liuer] is worried about [Sun Wukong], but two mountain monsters climb up in front of him. He runs to the hole smashed by [Boss Lady] with the little girl in his arms. [Zhu Bajie] sees the mountain monsters climbing up behind him.
0:52:44|0:53:1|Rushing towards the wall opening in a panic, [Jiang Liuer] was also knocked out. Several people fell onto the roof and were bounced off, coincidentally crushing [Boss Lady] who was just about to stand up and show her power. [Zhu Bajie] couldn't get up and could only roll away. Inside the inn, [Sun Wukong] was still pinned to the ground by a group of mountain demons.
0:53:1|0:53:13|With a roar, [Sun Wukong] blasted away all the mountain demons on his body, causing the entire inn to collapse. He leaped onto the back of the mountain demon, easily jumped a few times, and escaped from the inn.
0:53:15|0:53:18|[Hundun] stood on a wooden pole, looking down at [Sun Wukong].
0:53:18|0:53:40|He appeared to be a delicate young man with a white face, wearing a black hat with double wings. Gathering a ball of light between his hands, he suddenly rushed towards the ground, blasting the surrounding dust away. [Sun Wukong] roared as he jumped onto the old wooden boat docked by the shore, instantly lowering the sail. The dust from the ruins suddenly spread out in all directions, and a mutated mountain demon burst out of the ground.
0:53:40|0:54:2|[Sun Wukong] scanned the boat, grabbed the bamboo pole used to steer the boat, jumped onto the sail, waved the pole in his right hand, leaped into the air, and as the dharma seal gradually lit up, he shouted in pain, smashing a pole towards the mountain demon pouncing towards him. The low growl of the mountain demon crossed over him, blocking [Zhu Bajie] and [Jiang Liuer], these mountain demons were all black, but their backs were glowing like flowing magma.
0:54:2|0:54:22|[Sun Wukong] swung a bamboo pole to send the mountain demons flying one by one, then inserted the pole into the ground, leaped into the air, and performed a spinning flying kick. He danced with the bamboo pole in the air, and with a swing of the pole, knocked over a pile of mountain demons. One demon was sent flying to the side of a wooden boat, where [Zhu Bajie] performed a Tai Shan crushing move, causing the demon to shatter like charcoal.
0:54:22|0:54:27|[Jiang Liuer] saw the mountain demon approaching the boat, so she handed the little girl to [Zhu Bajie].
0:54:28|0:54:43|He lifted the gangplank onto the boat, just in time to block the mountain demon that was lunging at him. [Sun Wukong] pushed away the group of mountain demons with a bamboo pole, stepped on the pole, bounced out, reached out to catch the bouncing pole, and smashed the mountain demon boarding the boat with one strike.
0:54:43|0:54:48|He paused for a moment, then turned and threw a bamboo pole, which pierced through the mountain demon attacking [Jiang Liuer].
0:54:51|0:54:59|[Jiang Liuer] grabbed [Sun Wukong]'s arm nervously as his seal ignited in flames. The wooden boat drifted away from the riverbank, with mountain demons gathering on the shore.
0:55:0|0:55:19|In a valley not far away, the sky was glowing with red light. [Sun Wukong] sensed something was wrong, turned his head, and saw a glowing sphere flying towards them. After a huge explosion, a pair of feet resembling eagle claws slowly landed on the boat. He kicked [Zhu Bajie] away and used his magic power to gently catch the little girl.
0:55:21|0:55:27|[Hundun] held the little girl with one hand and took the Sun Wukong puppet from her hand, giving it a glance.
0:55:34|0:55:41|Hundun suddenly looked down, Jiang Liuer clung to his clothes tightly, and was then bounced by the air current onto a pillar.
0:55:44|0:56:3|[Hundun] raised his palm towards [Jiang Liuer], [Sun Wukong] saw this and quickly picked up a bamboo pole to strike at him. The two clashed with their powers, [Sun Wukong] was thrown into a pile of debris after only a few seconds, and [Hundun] stepped on [Sun Wukong]'s head.
0:56:3|0:56:21|[Hundun] pushed [Sun Wukong] into the deck, and as they ascended, he casually dropped a fireball, engulfing the entire wooden ship in flames. Grabbing the little girl, he landed back on the shore, and with a flick of his sleeve, the mountain demon beside him turned into ashes instantly. Laughing maniacally, he spun away.
0:56:21|0:56:39|On the shore, [Zhu Bajie] lay flat on the ground, continuously spitting out water. [Jiang Liuer] also lay on a rock coughing lightly. [Sun Wukong], who was lying by the jungle, moved his fingers, struggled to support his waist with both hands on the ground, and then stood up unsteadily.
0:56:39|0:56:47|He glanced back at [Jiang Liuer] silently, then lowered his head and walked towards the jungle, with [Jiang Liuer] quickly catching up.
0:57:4|0:57:10|[Sun Wukong] saw [Jiang Liuer] standing aside and lowered his fist that was about to hit [Zhu Bajie].
0:57:14|0:57:20|[Sun Wukong] turned his head to the side, closed his eyes, and [Jiang Liuer] retreated in disbelief, shaking her head.
0:57:29|0:57:47|[Jiang Liuer] ran into the jungle with tears in his eyes. He ran with his head down, tripped by a stone and fell far away, then got up and continued crying. He ran all the way to the river, shivering as he waded through the small river.
0:57:47|0:58:4|[Jiang Liuer] leaned against the giant rock on the river bank, slumping down on the stone. His small hands were red from the cold, and the two patches of highland red on his cheeks deepened. The fragmented golden sunlight filtered through the leaves, [Jiang Liuer] rubbed his eyes with his small hands and let out a tired sigh.
0:58:5|0:58:17|He stood up, propping his knees against the giant rock, about to leave. Two mountain demons crawled over, and [Jiang Liuer] cowered in fear behind the boulder.
0:58:19|0:58:28|Upon hearing this news, [Jiang Liuer] thought for a moment, gritted her teeth, and followed along.
0:58:33|0:58:53|In the jungle, [Sun Wukong] angrily smashed the rock with his right hand seal at the edge of the forest, accidentally injuring [Zhu Bajie] with the flying stones. Suddenly, [Zhu Bajie] floated into the air, and chunks of rocks floated beside [Sun Wukong]'s right hand. The light on his hand exploded instantly, and [Sun Wukong] collapsed as if he had exhausted all his strength, his body floating in the shallow water.
0:58:53|0:59:13|In the quiet jungle, [Jiang Liuer] took small steps cautiously, stopping from time to time. He carefully pushed aside the leaves on both sides, when suddenly a tree barrel carrying a mountain demon swiped over his head. Startled, [Jiang Liuer] lost control of his facial features and quickly looked in the direction where the tree barrel flew. A vine dropped from the cliff, extending all the way to the distant clouds.
0:59:28|0:59:49|[Sun Wukong] opens his eyes in the water, watching [Jiang Liuer] holding a puppet gradually disappear in front of him. Only the puppet remains floating in the water, as [Sun Wukong] pushes away the small fish around it, deeply immersed in memories.
1:0:18|1:0:39|[Sun Wukong] recalled the scene of causing havoc in the Heavenly Palace years ago. He passed through ten thousand arrows and turned into a ball of fire. Standing on the peak of the cloud, he confronted a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers. His bright and dazzling cloak was lifted by the wind and snow in the sky.
1:0:39|1:0:52|[Sun Wukong] suddenly emerged from the water, breaking free from his memories. He lay gasping for breath on the shallow bank, glanced at the puppet in his hand, and clenched it tightly.
1:0:54|1:1:2|[Zhu Bajie] had a glint in his eyes and nodded vigorously.
1:1:35|1:1:52|In the cave, the mountain demons all howled for [Hundun], but one of them noticed a small tree stump with a ghost face sneaking into a small cave in the rock wall. He hurried to catch up, only to be faced with three stone caves.
1:1:52|1:2:0|[Jiang Liuer] is on a stalactite above his head, slipping and almost falling off. The mountain demon looks at the cave and raises its claw.
1:2:8|1:2:16|The mountain demon, hit by the stalactite broken by [Jiang Liuer], suddenly woke up and happily ran into the stone cave pointed by the stalactite.
1:2:17|1:2:29|[Jiang Liuer] fell from the stone and got stuck in the hanging wooden board. The female mountain demon who just left was pulled back by the male mountain demon and approached [Jiang Liuer], only to be punched.
1:2:36|1:2:52|The female mountain demon suddenly took a hit, half of her sharp teeth fell out. [Fa Ming] wielded the flower staff with one hand and flung the staff, knocking out the female mountain demon who then dragged the mountain demon next to her down the cave entrance, plunging into Hundun's iron furnace.
1:3:5|1:3:22|[Fa Ming] tried to pull [Jiang Liuer] out, but they both fell down. [Jiang Liuer] grabbed onto a spherical wooden cage hanging in mid-air.
1:3:24|1:3:39|The spherical wooden cage, resembling a large pendulum, is suspended by ropes, swinging and knocking over the mountain demons watching around the cave. [Hundun] is extremely displeased, and the mountain demons behind [Hundun] panic and jump off the stone platform.
1:3:39|1:3:55|The glowing iron furnace smashed down, [Hundun] hurriedly used his hands to block it. Just as he let go, a wooden cage flew towards him, hitting the stone platform hard. [Hundun] propped himself up, gritting his teeth in anger. The iron furnace and wooden cage rolled out of the cave one after the other.
1:3:58|1:4:19|The wooden cage flew out of the demon cave and was blocked by a bird-shaped fence on a circular altar protruding from the cliff. The iron furnace was also stuck at the entrance of the wooden bridge leading to the altar, which stood lonely in the midst of the vast sea of clouds. Three sides of the cliff were surrounded by mountains, with temples hanging on the cliff walls. A pale-faced [Jiang Liuer] rushed towards her master.
1:4:21|1:4:40|The little girl looked up at the sky, a black disc slowly approaching the sun, casting a shadow over the cliff, and mountain demons gathering on the peak. [Hundun] pinched the mouth of the mountain demon.
1:4:41|1:4:48|[Hundun] uses his magical powers to teleport and charges towards [Jiang Liuer].
1:5:4|1:5:26|[Jiang Liuer] was pinched until his eyes rolled back, struggling to breathe. He watched the hawk soaring in the sky, gradually closing his eyes. A vortex appeared in the white mist at the bottom of the cliff, and a white dragon suddenly rushed up, knocking down [Hundun], taking away [Jiang Liuer]. When [Hundun] took a closer look, he saw two people sitting on the white dragon.
1:5:26|1:5:40|The white dragon danced in the air, turned around, facing [Hundun], and dived straight down. The white dragon lightning-fast drilled into the demon cave on the cliff, and a dragon eye appeared in the mist.
1:5:43|1:5:47|The White Dragon bit the foot of the shocked female mountain demon and flung her into the sky.
1:5:48|1:6:1|Flying up into the air again, he grabbed her in his mouth and swayed his tail as he drilled into the clouds. [Jiang Liuer] lay on the ground, struggling to lift her head, as thick smoke billowed from the entrance of the demon cave, revealing a humanoid black shadow.
1:6:2|1:6:24|Quietly appearing, [Sun Wukong] emerges from the smoke and squints at the altar. A group of mountain demons crowd behind rocks to watch, with [Hundun] standing up and cursing.
1:6:32|1:6:45|[Zhu Bajie] held the rake, his body swelling piece by piece, his figure multiplied several times, holding the rake and swinging it towards [Hundun]. Unexpectedly, he was hit by [Hundun]'s magic ball and instantly turned into a little piglet.
1:6:45|1:6:56|Rolling all the way to the feet of [Jiang Liuer]. [Zhu Bajie] saw his pig hooves shrink and was immediately confused. [Sun Wukong] hid the stone behind him, jumped tens of feet high in an instant, threw the stone, and knocked away [Hundun]'s magic ball.
1:6:56|1:7:8|A group of mountain demons were knocked off a cliff by a magic ball. [Sun Wukong] flew up and threw a punch, which was blocked by [Hundun] with one hand. [Hundun] grabbed him and spun him around, then kicked him into the demon cave, smashing through several walls in a row.
1:7:11|1:7:18|[Hundun] rushed towards the altar, but was pushed aside by flying rocks, his black gauze hat blown off, and his hair scattered.
1:7:20|1:7:32|[Sun Wukong] flew up and kicked out two huge rocks, [Hundun] lifted his foot to kick one piece, dodged another piece by leaning back, shook off the mountain demon flying towards him, soared into the sky, and reached out to grab [Sun Wukong], who was struck head-on by [Hundun].
1:7:32|1:7:48|Before he could recover, [Hundun] appeared behind him and kicked him off the roof. [Hundun] then flew ahead and kicked [Sun Wukong] back to the ground. With a burst of energy, [Hundun] conjured a fireball, which hit [Sun Wukong] directly, causing a mushroom cloud to rise from the altar.
1:7:52|1:8:11|[Hundun] fell heavily back to the ground, gasping as he stood up and looked at the motionless [Sun Wukong]. He took a step towards him, and suddenly [Sun Wukong] grabbed his ankle.
1:8:18|1:8:29|[Sun Wukong] was shining all over, punching [Hundun] up into the sky. The mountain demon watching the excitement also cheered, and [Hundun], looking around at the little demons, resentfully threw out a magic ball.
1:8:29|1:8:40|[Sun Wukong] withstood the attack of the magic ball, using all four limbs, running at the speed of light to dodge [Hundun]'s magical pursuit. [Hundun] released light blades resembling boomerangs, [Sun Wukong] somersaulted continuously to evade the attack, then leaped into the air.
1:8:40|1:8:45|Jumping onto the suspended temple, he ran and dodged on the eaves, then rushed towards [Hundun] facing the shining blade.
1:8:46|1:9:1|[Hundun] brought a huge rock to block the way, but it was shattered by [Sun Wukong] with a palm strike. [Hundun] tumbled several times, and before he could stabilize himself, he was pushed off the cliff by [Sun Wukong]. The two fought on the wooden bridge platform below the bridge, with [Sun Wukong] being thrown to the bridge head by [Hundun], only to be pulled back by a rope.
1:9:4|1:9:13|[Hundun] releases a tracking spell ball, [Sun Wukong] spins and jumps in the middle of the wooden frame, avoiding the crazy impacts of the spell ball. [Sun Wukong] then punches [Hundun] in the face.
1:9:14|1:9:26|The iron furnace on the bridge was about to collapse. [Sun Wukong] immediately rushed towards [Hundun], and the two of them knocked down the wooden frame of the bridge tower. [Hundun] threw a magic ball, which was hit by [Sun Wukong] and flew off, hitting the wooden frame next to the iron furnace.
1:9:26|1:9:36|The iron furnace rolled down the bridge platform layer by layer, and the two fought in the flying debris. [Hundun] seemed to have exhausted his strength, and [Sun Wukong] quickly embraced him from behind.
1:9:37|1:9:55|Hundun's body gradually swelled, his face turned from white to black, his mouth tore open, revealing sharp teeth, and the iron furnace came crashing down. Below the altar, the wooden bridge half hidden in thick fog creaked, and Hundun roared as he fell into the deep valley. Sun Wukong climbed up the broken end of the wooden board with his hands.
1:10:5|1:10:25|[Jiang Liuer] joyfully catches the puppet thrown by [Sun Wukong]. At this moment, the sun is blocked by a black disk, and a total solar eclipse appears. The wooden bridge seems to be violently impacted and sways up and down. Little Zhu Bajie is shaken and hits the railing of the bridge. A muffled thunder sound echoes from the abyss, terrifying the mountain demons.
1:10:25|1:10:41|The wooden bridge suddenly stopped swaying, and [Jiang Liuer] who was holding onto the cage stood up and ran to the edge of the bridge. Looking down, a four-fingered giant claw reached out from the abyss's white mist and slapped the stone pillar supporting the altar. A monster with a huge bloody mouth stood up in the white mist.
1:10:41|1:10:50|The monster, which looks like a giant flesh worm, crawled up the altar along the wooden frame, causing [Jiang Liuer] standing at the cliff's edge to widen her eyes in fear.
1:11:1|1:11:21|The monster, with no ears, eyes, or nose, and six legs all over its wrinkled body, is the true form of the ancient fierce beast [Hundun]. [Hundun] clings to the cliff, crawling towards [Jiang Liuer] and the others. It opens its huge mouth, howls to the sky, and pounces towards the wooden cage containing young boys and girls. [Jiang Liuer] quickly dodges, leaving the empty wooden cage.
1:11:21|1:11:38|Rolled down the deep valley. As the dust settled, the little girl clung to [Jiang Liuer]'s clothes, hanging on to him. [Fa Ming] and the children were nearby, standing on a protrusion of the cliff, with a sheer drop below. [Hundun] got up, approached [Jiang Liuer], but was hit on the head by a falling rock.
1:11:38|1:11:53|[Sun Wukong] leaped and broke the hard stones sticking out of the cliff, which hit [Hundun] and sent it sliding down to the valley. A beam of light shot out from Hundun's mouth, hitting [Sun Wukong], causing him to fall from the sky as if in a daze.
1:11:53|1:12:7|[Hundun] lifted his huge claw and slammed [Sun Wukong] into the cliff, while [Jiang Liuer] and [Fa Ming] took the child and temporarily hid on the plank road. [Hundun] picked up a large rock and blocked the entrance where [Sun Wukong] was, causing [Jiang Liuer] to run to the edge of the plank road with the little girl in her arms, then anxiously turn back.
1:12:18|1:12:21|[Jiang Liuer] smiled and agreed, then ran towards [Hundun].
1:12:23|1:12:34|He climbed up to the cave entrance along the cracks in the rocks, [Hundun] was still in place, using his claws to push the boulder into the cave, [Jiang Liuer] climbed up to the entrance, [Sun Wukong] was being pressed against the stone wall by the boulder.
1:13:0|1:13:22|[Jiang Liuer] pulled out a wooden stick from the pile of rocks. The stick flew out and got stuck between the two sharp teeth of [Hundun]. [Jiang Liuer] stood still, stunned, and sniffed. [Hundun] raised its huge claw. [Jiang Liuer] dodged the heavy blow from [Hundun], but was swept under the bridge by a powerful airflow.
1:13:22|1:13:39|He stood up and shouted at the roaring Hundun. Jiang Liuer shouted and then turned to run, successfully provoking Hundun. Hundun fiercely slammed its two front paws towards him, only hitting the rocks behind him.
1:13:39|1:13:54|[Hundun] roared and lunged towards [Jiang Liuer]. Inside the stone cave, [Sun Wukong] exerted all his strength to push open the solid rock, which exploded under his brute force, with a burst of light emanating from his right hand seal.
1:13:54|1:14:14|[Jiang Liuer] jumped down the broken stone layer and stood firm. In front of her was a narrow stone bridge. [Hundun] crashed through the stone wall behind her, so [Jiang Liuer] hurriedly ran onto the bridge. It slapped off half of the bridge with one palm, but luckily [Jiang Liuer] had already run to the other side. [Hundun] opened its mouth and pounced towards [Jiang Liuer].
1:14:25|1:14:31|[Sun Wukong] broke through the clouds and jumped onto [Hundun]'s back.
1:14:34|1:14:42|[Jiang Liuer] covered her head in fear, but peeked at [Hundun] with one eye. [Sun Wukong] jumped down from Hundun's head, and [Jiang Liuer] raised her hands high to greet him.
