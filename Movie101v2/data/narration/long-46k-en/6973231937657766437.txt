0:4:0|0:4:7|[Li Tianran] and senior sister saw [Zhu Qianlong] take out a land deed from his bosom,
0:4:37|0:4:49|[Zhu Qianlong] bowed with his fists, then suddenly drew his gun and shot the master in the forehead. With another shot, the master fell to the ground.
0:4:58|0:5:20|[Zhu Qianlong] approached [Li Tianran], who was so scared that he knelt on the ground. The gun slowly approached, but [Li Tianran] dodged four shots in a row. As he chased [Li Tianran] out of the house, [Li Tianran] was shot and fell to the ground.
0:5:27|0:5:41|The raging fire immediately ignited on the body, engulfing the house. Under the cover of night, the two escaped from the manor. Two figures swiftly ran down the hillside, and the two quickly got into the car and drove away into the desolate snowy field.
0:5:43|0:6:3|Unexpectedly, another car turned at the intersection, and the two cars nearly collided. The [Doctor Hendler] in the car cursed at their driving skills. Turning back, [Doctor Hendler] noticed the fire on the mountaintop. He slammed on the brakes and quickly looked over, only to see a figure with fire behind them, shouting as they ran down the hillside from top to bottom.
0:6:4|0:6:11|Doctor Hendler looked in horror at the newcomer, the miraculously surviving Li Tianran, who was clinging to the front of the car and screaming in agony.
0:6:15|0:6:27|The sound of four gunshots introduces the title: "Evil Cannot Overcome Righteousness". American doctor [Doctor Hendler] adopted [Li Tianran] and kept him in San Francisco to protect him. Fifteen years later,
0:6:27|0:6:49|[Li Tianran] practices shooting in the jungle with a gun in each hand. On the training ground, [Li Tianran] wields a knife to chop off wooden stakes, runs long distances on the road. Through repeated shooting and chopping, day after day, he hones his skills, developing strong arms, agile movements, and precise marksmanship with unwavering perseverance.
0:6:49|0:6:55|In the jungle, Li Tianran effortlessly runs across the log, then steps forward to the obstacle net and climbs up with all his strength.
0:6:59|0:7:6|The car brought him to the manor, in the office, the chief approved Li Tianran's application, Li Tianran was very excited, he could finally return to Beijing.
0:8:37|0:8:45|[Li Tianran] imitated it once and asked how to continue the next line. The officer patted his forehead twice with the back of his hand, and [Li Tianran] followed suit.
0:8:54|0:9:9|The sound of the train whistle pierced the sky, the cold of the snow-covered Beiping was intense, and the branches on both sides of the railway were covered with ice chips. The eaves of the drum tower were also covered with thick snow, everything looked like a silver world.
0:9:9|0:9:24|On the train, Li Tianran looked at the appearance of Beiping like this, expressing a deep longing for his hometown as an outsider. Will the justice that Li Tianran's heart calls for be able to prevail as the land soon ignites with war?
0:9:24|0:9:48|The train slowed down, its front releasing hot steam, attempting to melt the chill in the air over Beiping. A figure walked against the tracks, a middle-aged man in a hat and a neat coat, gazing at the train's windows as he approached. [Li Tianran] carried two large suitcases to greet his father, the middle-aged man who was Doctor Hendler.
0:11:45|0:11:57|The car slowly stopped at the door, [Lan Qingfeng] was pushing a bicycle out, greeted the two, the father closed the car door, [Lan Qingfeng] pushed the bike closer to [Li Tianran],
0:12:37|0:12:45|[Lan Qingfeng] hummed a song as he rode away on his bicycle.
0:13:47|0:14:0|[Zhu Qianlong] and [Lan Qingfeng] stepped back together, with [Lan Qingfeng] signaling that they could begin. The two of them knelt down slowly, then prostrated themselves on the ground, knocking their heads. The portrait of Zhu Yuanzhang on the wall was gently shaken by the knocking, but the two of them showed no intention of stopping.
0:14:1|0:14:20|After performing the kowtow three times, the two finally stood up. [Zhu Qianlong] rubbed his eyes, tears seemed to be hanging at the corners of his eyes. He walked slowly towards the portrait, and the [Zhu Qianlong] next to the portrait mimicked the same posture.
0:16:29|0:16:41|[Lan Qingfeng] took a puff of his cigar, smiling as he looked at [Zhu Qianlong]. [Zhu Qianlong]'s expression changed immediately, realizing that the other party was not joking.
0:17:13|0:17:19|Toasting joyfully, the two clinked their glasses.
0:19:32|0:19:42|Approaching, the subordinate whispered a few words, [Zhu Qianlong] had just picked up a dumpling, but then he put it back on the plate.
0:21:35|0:21:58|[Li Tianran] stared into his father's eyes, and his father met his gaze without flinching. The car drove out of the back door of the [Lan family] at night, and [Lan Qingfeng] at the door smiled as [Zhu Qianlong]'s car left. Not far from the departure of the car, a figure leaped onto the roof with a push of his hands, quietly following the car on the roof without anyone noticing. Meanwhile, [Doctor Hendler] paid a visit to [Lan Qingfeng].
0:22:10|0:22:32|Cars drove by on the street, while a figure chased relentlessly on the snow-covered eaves. The agile figure was none other than Li Tianran, who was eager for revenge. The car turned into an alley, Li Tianran swiftly turned and leaped over the roof, while on the other side Doctor Hendler was visibly emotional.
0:23:7|0:23:25|On the roof, [Li Tianran] leaped into the courtyard with arms outstretched. After entering the house and closing the door with a muttered curse, he turned on the light, took off his mask, and leaned back on the bed, looking at himself in the mirror. Breathing heavily, [Li Tianran] took a nut from the small table.
0:26:2|0:26:16|[Li Tianran] took the opportunity to blend in with the doctors being driven out and left. He walked through the corridor, turned onto a side path, went upstairs, passed through several room doors, and arrived in front of the mirror in the injection room. He took off his mask and washed his face.
0:26:20|0:26:42|Suddenly, the sound of the door opening was heard, and [Li Tianran] immediately became alert. He gently turned off the tap and walked slowly towards it. As he reached the curtain, a well-dressed woman's figure was reflected in it. Seeing this, [Li Tianran] slowly put on his mask. Unexpectedly, the curtain was suddenly pulled open by the other party, revealing a charming beauty who claimed to be looking for [Doctor Hendler].
0:27:14|0:27:27|[Li Tianran] walked out of the curtain in a daze, and a beautiful woman in a cheongsam was splitting her legs apart. As [Li Tianran] looked over, lace panties were hanging on the screen. He lifted the cheongsam and used alcohol cotton to wipe the woman's crotch.
0:27:44|0:27:57|Tang Fengyi pushed away Zhu Qianlong, who wanted to kiss her buttocks. Zhu Qianlong left the room, and at that moment Li Tianran walked out from behind the curtain with a syringe in hand. Li Tianran readily agreed to his request.
0:27:58|0:28:5|After a simple disinfection, the needle was immediately inserted, and as the syringe advanced, [Tang Fengyi] showed a look of enjoyment.
0:28:17|0:28:22|On the other side, in the hospital, [Tang Fengyi] was flirting with [Li Tianran] joyfully.
0:28:32|0:28:45|Later, he took out a tip and a business card, letting [Li Tianran] choose. After a moment of hesitation, [Li Tianran] took the tip. [Tang Fengyi], displeased, shot him a glance, then picked up her coat from the hanger and walked out straight. [Li Tianran] turned around, and the underwear left on the screen swayed in the wind.
0:28:47|0:28:51|[Li Tianran] hurried to the window and watched as the car drove out of the hospital below.
0:28:52|0:29:1|He guessed that the person who had just left the car was most likely [Zhu Qianlong]. [Li Tianran] put on his coat, walked out, and quickly went upstairs. He jumped from the window of the stairs to the roof.
0:29:1|0:29:26|He used both hands and feet to climb quickly to the highest point of the roof, and with a push of his arms, he vaulted over. Then he hurried to a poplar tree and realized he had to cross the road to catch up. So, [Li Tianran] stepped on the power line and slowly passed over the road. In front of him was a vast expanse of roofs, densely packed and orderly. For [Li Tianran], who had trained for many years, it was like walking on flat ground. His figure moved lightly and swiftly.
0:29:26|0:29:33|Li Tianran easily crossed over the eaves one by one, swiftly climbed up the beams, as if this place was his home turf.
0:29:33|0:29:49|Outside the city, the car raced away, kicking up clouds of yellow dust. [Li Tianran] was stopped by the moat, so he had to detour through the woods to catch up. By the time the car was about to reach its destination, [Zhu Qianlong] walked into the execution ground.
0:30:13|0:30:21|[Zhu Qianlong] shot and killed Chinese people, but he gained the support and admiration of the people, confidently waving as he climbed onto the car.
0:33:42|0:34:10|On this sunny day, Li Tianran stepped out of the house in the early morning, walking through the streets and alleys bathed in sunlight. The cold winter had already passed, with the sound of cicadas everywhere, and the bustling alleys of Beiping were filled with constant shouts of vendors. Li Tianran dodged the cars and crossed to the other side of the road. He jumped up and burst a pig bladder, then approached a skinny man.
0:34:30|0:34:50|[Li Tianran] finally caught up, but the smoker had already run away for a while. [Li Tianran] trained day and night to improve his running, naturally surpassing the smoker. The smoker often hung around this area, using his familiarity with the environment to navigate alleys and streets. [Li Tianran] relentlessly pursued him to the front of a bookstore, where the smoker was injecting himself with drugs.
0:35:50|0:36:14|[Li Tianran] peeked through the door curtain of the bookstore, feeling triumphant. Behind the curtain, [Guan Qiaohong] leaned on a cane and swayed as she walked through the alley and left. After [Li Tianran] who had just been injected stood up, he was now in an excited state, feeling refreshed. [Li Tianran] walked briskly into the front alley, heading towards the tailor shop at the end of the alley. He saw a motorcycle parked in front of the tailor shop.
0:36:14|0:36:26|Approaching, he found a figure in a windbreaker squatting to repair a motorcycle. [Li Tianran] walked up and twisted the throttle, pretending to be cleverly asking:
0:39:54|0:40:3|A silver dollar flies in, [Li Tianran] holds a teacup and listens to the sound to determine the location, catches it in mid-air, and takes a closer look.
0:41:29|0:41:42|Li Tianran remembered the secret code the commander gave him before leaving, then disappeared on the rooftop, only to return again.
0:41:46|0:42:7|On the eaves, [Li Tianran] moves swiftly, leaping into the air and taking several steps before landing on the rafters. He identifies the direction, then moves like a monkey, climbing up and down. Sometimes he runs like a gazelle on the narrow rafters, which seem to be his playground. [Li Tianran] alternates between quick steps, somersaults, and jumps.
0:42:7|0:42:24|His clean and neat movements, full of aesthetic appeal, make him seem to effortlessly navigate the eaves and walls. Crossing over a roof, [Li Tianran] furrowed his brow and approached slowly. Through the gaps in the trees, [Li Tianran] saw a small flag in the courtyard not far away, with four large characters reflected on it: "Genben Ichiro Bookstore".
0:42:24|0:42:39|In the courtyard, young people were playing around, with [Li Tianran] lying on the eaves, carefully observing the situation in the courtyard. The sound of reading came, and [Li Tianran] slid down from the roof and climbed over to the other side of the roof.
0:43:25|0:43:33|[Li Tianran] tiptoed through the corridor, seeing that no one noticed him.
0:43:58|0:44:15|Returning home, [Li Tianran] entered the inner room and leaped to hide the samurai sword on the ceiling beam. Then, he lay on the bed and took out a seal, sighed, and stamped it on his hand. The scene shifted to [Li Tianran] playing with the seal, running to his father's room only to find it empty. He noticed the fabric on the sofa with great joy.
0:46:2|0:46:8|Tang Fengyi seductively lay on the bed, revealing her hot figure, and injected the medicine for Li Tianran, suddenly,
0:47:2|0:47:5|[Tang Fengyi] gasped as she crossed the living room and answered the phone.
0:48:42|0:48:56|On the other side, Genben Ichiro met Lan Qingfeng at dusk on the city wall. After confirming their identities by shouting to each other from a distance, they both walked slowly up the city wall.
0:49:47|0:49:57|As the sky darkened, [Lan Qingfeng] quickly walked down the city wall. Not far away, a neatly dressed yellow carriage driver was waiting. [Lan Qingfeng] jogged onto the carriage.
0:50:8|0:50:34|That day, [Li Tianran] wearing shorts rode his bike onto the archway. The pedals of the bike were obviously modified unlike traditional ones. [Li Tianran] rode the bike freely on the roof, like an acrobat, sometimes falling from high rooftops and sometimes climbing up from low eaves. His shadow under the sunlight reflected on the well-arranged rooftops, giving a taste of summer.
0:50:35|0:50:46|The bicycle slowly rode into the tailor shop on the second floor where [Guan Qiaohong] was standing with tea in hand, watching. When [Li Tianran] rode the bicycle in, she then went downstairs.
0:52:9|0:52:28|In the blink of an eye, it was the day to bid farewell to Doctor Hendler. A luxury car drove into the embassy district in the eastern suburbs, and the soldiers at the gate quickly let it through when they saw the license plate. The embassy district was filled with heavy European-style buildings, and three luxury cars arrived from different directions, one after another pulling into the Six Nations Hotel.
0:54:47|0:55:4|Doctor Hendler leaned on the table, staring intensely at Zhu Qianlong. The atmosphere suddenly dropped to freezing point, with everyone at the table showing different expressions. Zhu Qianlong fixed his gaze fiercely on Doctor Hendler, while Lan Qingfeng lowered his head and smoked a cigar. Tang Fengyi kept her head down without looking elsewhere, and Genben Ichiro watched the two of them, anticipating how it would end.
0:55:18|0:55:26|[Zhu Qianlong] slapped [Tang Fengyi] hard across the face.
0:56:15|0:56:21|[Tang Fengyi] sat down, [Zhu Qianlong] rubbed his own cheeks.
0:56:48|0:56:55|The doctor [Doctor Hendler], who pretends to be crazy, jumps onto a chair and takes off his pants.
0:57:12|0:57:18|Li Tianran, dressed as a bartender, reluctantly picked up the ice bucket and walked out.
0:57:52|0:58:10|In front of the table, [Zhu Qianlong] vigorously shook the champagne, with a thin piece of ice held between his fingertips in the distance, aiming towards the dining table. At the moment the champagne was opened, the ice block in [Li Tianran]'s hand shot out swiftly, and in an instant, the thin ice pierced through [Zhu Qianlong]'s eyelid.
1:0:18|1:0:24|Doctor Hendler was pushed off the city wall by Lan Qingfeng.
1:3:36|1:3:47|Daughter [Lan Lan] came out to put a hood on [Li Tianran]. After driving for a while, when his hood was removed, he found himself sitting on the clock tower.
1:4:9|1:4:25|[Lan Qingfeng] attracted a pigeon to land in his hand, and he held the pigeon.
1:5:22|1:5:46|As the car stops in front of the Lan residence, several secret agents rush out from the door. [Lan Qingfeng] and his daughter get out of the car. The agents hang the police signboard at the Lan residence. Lan Qingfeng's daughter quickly walks towards the house. [Zhu Qianlong] dismisses his subordinates, who then run into the house.
1:7:35|1:8:3|At the entrance of the tailor shop, [Guan Qiaohong] vigorously pedaled her bicycle in place. In the cool night, [Li Tianran] walked over. He swiftly arrived in front of [Guan Qiaohong], who stopped her bike and looked up at [Li Tianran].
1:8:28|1:8:38|[Li Tianran] brought his tear-streaked face close to [Guan Qiaohong],
1:9:44|1:9:54|[Li Tianran] walked away on the high beam, while [Guan Qiaohong] stood on the roof looking at the disappearing [Li Tianran] from afar. [Guan Qiaohong] guessed that it was Mr. Lan who prevented [Li Tianran] from going home.
1:9:54|1:10:9|Early in the morning, Guan Qiaohong arrived at the Lan family with the clothes she made for Li Tianran. She saw a police station sign hanging on the gate of the Lan family. At the same time, Li Tianran crossed the archway and arrived at the tailor shop, where he found that the wooden support for Guan Qiaohong's bicycle had been broken.
1:11:59|1:12:11|Tang Fengyi's face turned pale, Li Tianran got up from the bed, while on the other side Guan Qiaohong returned to the tailor shop.
1:13:54|1:14:7|[Li Tianran] let out a cry, shook off the water on his face and walked out of the shower. He gently picked up a women's nightgown. When [Tang Fengyi] returned, the bathroom was empty, with only the curtains swaying in the wind.
1:14:15|1:14:31|[Li Tianran] dashed down from the archway in his pajamas, his bare bottom exposed. His agile figure leaped and jumped over several houses with a few swift steps, gracefully gliding over the eaves. He swiftly made his way to [Guan Qiaohong]'s tailor shop.
1:14:31|1:14:39|Approaching, he looked around and noticed that [Guan Qiaohong] was not upstairs. He then walked towards the inner room, where the two of them coincidentally met in the hallway.
1:15:1|1:15:15|[Li Tianran] pulled on the dried shorts and [Guan Qiaohong] started pedaling hard on the bicycle for rehabilitation training. As the sky darkened, [Guan Qiaohong] climbed up the archway to the agreed place, where the evening breeze gently brushed her beautiful skirt.
1:15:33|1:16:3|[Li Tianran] took a few steps forward and arrived at one end of the roof. He first climbed onto the beam by holding onto a pillar, then briskly walked to the other end with small steps. He effortlessly leaped down while holding onto another pillar. At the other end of the archway, [Guan Qiaohong] slowly ascended by holding onto a pillar. The evening breeze gently lifted the hem of her skirt as she opened her arms and moved slowly to the middle of the archway. She then crossed over the eaves and climbed onto the middle beam, still with her arms outstretched, walking slowly.
1:16:3|1:16:19|The cool night breeze blew her black hair gently as [Guan Qiaohong] moved slowly to the edge of the rooftop, leaning on a pillar. [Li Tianran] stood below with open arms to welcome her, as [Guan Qiaohong] slowly moved towards the pillar.
1:17:0|1:17:28|[Li Tianran] lifts the big bell, [Guan Qiaohong] lifts her skirt and goes in, [Li Tianran] follows. [Li Tianran] steps on the mechanism, and a hemp rope slowly descends from the top. [Guan Qiaohong] grabs the hemp rope, [Li Tianran] jumps and pulls on the rope, using a pulley to pull [Guan Qiaohong] up. Then he slowly climbs up the rope, opens the top, and both of them stick their heads out.
1:17:28|1:17:35|Li Tianran emerged first, then helped Guan Qiaohong down from the bell tower to the platform.
1:17:59|1:18:10|At the sound of a gunshot, [Li Tianran] raised his hands and turned around to see [Guan Qiaohong] pointing a silenced pistol at himself.
1:19:24|1:19:40|[Li Tianran] turned around and found that [Guan Qiaohong] had dropped the gun and was already walking away from the top of the clock tower. At the Lan's house, [Lan Qingfeng] was reading the newspaper when a stone hit the newspaper.
1:20:21|1:20:39|[Li Tianran] supported the spy, [Lan Qingfeng] took out his phone, and the three of them posed for a photo. He wrapped it in a tablecloth, packed it up, and slung it over [Li Tianran].
1:20:50|1:20:56|In the early morning, [Guan Qiaohong] is pedaling a bicycle in the tailor shop, while [Li Tianran] walks towards the archway with a package on his back.
1:21:41|1:21:58|After seeing the photo, [Zhu Qianlong] quickly hid away. The setting sun cast its rays on the drum tower, [Li Tianran] sat in front of the tower eating the beef from the package. Hearing someone clapping, [Li Tianran] walked over, it was [Guan Qiaohong], descending slowly from the top.
1:22:52|1:23:18|After climbing down from the bell tower, Li Tianran arrived at the opium warehouse. He moved swiftly and approached, using a running start to press the spy's head into a bowl. He knocked out the spy on the left with a headbutt, then kicked down the one on the right. The commotion caught the attention of the Japanese. Li Tianran turned around, his eyes sharp. Calmly, he picked up a noodle with chopsticks from the table, counting the number of enemies.
1:23:19|1:23:41|[Li Tianran] flicked the chopsticks, piercing into the bodies of the two men. With a swift step forward, he pulled out the chopsticks and stabbed fiercely at one of them. Dodging the man's attack with a quick turn, he moved behind him and stabbed at his lower back. The third man had his arm broken as Li Tianran locked it, then he kicked the man's knee. The last one was already scared by him.
1:23:41|1:24:8|[Li Tianran] subdued one with a shoulder throw, then turned around to deliver a knee strike to a third. He stormed towards the opium warehouse with a samurai sword in hand, lifting the lid to inspect. [Li Tianran] cut off the chandelier with his sword, ignited the opium with a spark from connecting the zero line and the fire line.
1:24:11|1:24:27|In the distance, the opium warehouse in the woods was billowing thick smoke. [Li Tianran], looking disheveled, crossed over the roof. His hair was messy, his clothes were in disarray, his hands and face were blackened by soot, but he was feeling very pleased at this moment.
1:24:27|1:24:45|[Guan Qiaohong] looked at the distant fire on the drum tower, [Li Tianran] opened the cover of the big clock and emerged. He walked lightly to [Guan Qiaohong]'s side, and [Guan Qiaohong] gazed happily at the distant fire.
1:26:2|1:26:17|[Li Tianran] slowly approached and tackled [Guan Qiaohong]. The bright moon shone outside the building, with the distant opium warehouse emitting smoke and flickering firelight. A car drove into the Japanese military headquarters.
1:26:52|1:26:58|A big cannon was pushed to Lugou Bridge by the Japanese army.
1:27:2|1:27:7|This is the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. [Genben Ichiro] goes to the police station to find [Lan Qingfeng].
1:27:23|1:27:40|[Lan Qingfeng] put away the envelope, and the two of them sat down at a French restaurant. After opening the envelope and confirming with [Genben Ichiro], it was classified documents with only one name on the list: "[Zhu Qianlong]".
1:27:43|1:27:50|[Lan Qingfeng] stared at [Genben Ichiro] for a while, feeling like he was being played, and couldn't help but chuckle.
1:27:51|1:27:58|[Genben Ichiro] smiled as he watched [Lan Qingfeng], who kept flipping through the list to confirm that there was only one name.
1:28:11|1:28:19|[Lan Qingfeng] gritted his teeth and praised the Japanese for being formidable, as the shop owner brought over a teapot.
1:29:33|1:29:47|Lan Qingfeng, watch closely. Just as the rickshaw pulled away, Genben Ichiro gave the order, and the Japanese spy shot the rickshaw driver. Three Japanese spies then approached Genben Ichiro to report the completion of the mission. Genben Ichiro waved his hand to dismiss them.
1:30:12|1:30:22|Several people lifted the deceased onto the yellow carriage and drove away, while [Genben Ichiro] laughed wildly.
1:30:29|1:30:35|Guan Qiaohong looked at the distant billowing flames from the drum tower.
1:32:50|1:32:55|[Guan Qiaohong] held a cup of tea, pursed her lips, gazing into the distance, lost in memories. Tears glistened faintly in [Guan Qiaohong]'s eyes.
1:33:35|1:33:41|In the early morning at the tailor shop, [Guan Qiaohong] is drawing water from the well while asking [Li Tianran].
1:35:58|1:36:11|[Li Tianran] looked like a child who had been wronged, shouting to leave, but [Guan Qiaohong] did not say a word to stop him. [Guan Qiaohong] stood on the roof, watching [Li Tianran] walking away in the distance from the archway. The decent young man ran away without looking back.
1:36:12|1:36:30|[Guan Qiaohong] couldn't help but wonder in her heart, can he seek revenge? Can I? As she thought about it, at this moment, inside the sealed wall of the Lan family, [Lan Qingfeng] was knocking on the wall. The sound of knocking on the wall reached [Zhu Qianlong] and [Genben Ichiro] clearly.
1:38:1|1:38:9|[Lan Qingfeng] loaded the pistol, walked quickly towards the car, [Xi Jie] came to see him off, handing bullets to [Lan Qingfeng],
1:38:19|1:38:32|The car drove away from the Lan family, and at this moment, in Tang Fengyi's home, Zhu Qianlong, who was about to leave, suddenly stopped and walked around in a circle.
1:38:39|1:39:9|On the drum tower, a carrier pigeon flies in. [Li Tianran] takes down the pigeon and becomes excited when he touches the letter on its leg. Meanwhile, [Lan Qingfeng] drives on the road, while [Tang Fengyi] at home ponders on how to save [Li Tianran]. [Li Tianran] opens the letter, excitedly sends off the pigeon, and goes to the tailor shop. [Guan Qiaohong] drinks tea and reads the newspaper in the shop. Hearing the sound of a car approaching, she gets up to greet the visitor, who turns out to be [Tang Fengyi] coming to deliver a message.
1:39:52|1:40:0|[Tang Fengyi] drove away after speaking, leaving [Guan Qiaohong] to ponder whether what [Tang Fengyi] said was trustworthy.
1:40:0|1:40:22|Meanwhile, [Lan Qingfeng] was driving towards the bell tower. Inside the tower, [Li Tianran] was holding a pocket watch, counting down to the departure time. Sensing the urgency, [Lan Qingfeng] had to speed up. [Li Tianran] placed the pocket watch on the big clock and stared at it intently. The car stopped under the drum tower, [Li Tianran] ran over and quickly jumped into the carriage. The car then raced away in a cloud of dust.
1:43:48|1:44:7|The tailor shop's motorcycle has arrived, and [Li Tianran] quickly jumps onto the moving motorcycle. [Lan Qingfeng] sheds tears as he watches the motorcycle gradually moving away, which represents all his hopes. At that moment, [Zhu Qianlong]'s car also arrives.
1:44:29|1:44:41|Two men stood facing each other with guns across the car window, while the coachman and the secret agent began fighting on the bridge. Bullets hit the car's windshield, and the secret agent, with the advantage in numbers, suppressed the coachman. The sound of gunfire in the fierce battle was incessant.
1:44:44|1:45:13|Passengers on the bridge joined the fight, while more police rushed to support. Inside the car, two people still confronted each other with guns. Meanwhile, a spy approached to give the driver more ammunition, but the driver pulled out a grenade. The grenade was thrown into [Zhu Qianlong]'s car, and in a hurry, he tried to throw it into [Lan Qingfeng]'s car, but it kept getting thrown back. The two of them then crawled out of the windows on both sides and jumped off the bridge.
1:45:13|1:45:22|The car engine blown away fell into the water, while on the other side, a motorcycle was approaching.
1:45:28|1:45:44|At the same time, a car crashes through the back door of [Lan Qingfeng]'s house. Inside the courtyard, [Zhu Qianlong]'s men grab [Lan Qingfeng]'s legs and drag him on the ground. Seeing this, he immediately performs an aerial spin kick to knock down [Zhu Qianlong].
1:45:58|1:46:7|At the same time, Guan Qiaohong drove a motorcycle, carrying Li Tianran to Genben Ichiro's house, and the motorcycle turned and stopped.
1:46:23|1:46:43|[Guan Qiaohong] tried to inquire the old woman without success. She used a needle to carve out words on the window, which read "Guan Qiaohong delivers the challenge letter for [Li Tianran]." Then she took out a newspaper and pointed to the words on it.
1:47:37|1:48:10|Li Tianran and Zhu Qianlong walked through the corridor together towards the inner room. They saw Lao Pan standing downstairs. Li Tianran went downstairs and suddenly a figure flashed by, knocking Li Tianran unconscious with a stick. The secret agent stepped forward to pick him up, but Li Tianran suddenly opened his eyes and delivered a flying kick, knocking down the two men. Another secret agent came out and grabbed Li Tianran's arm, delivering a series of kicks. Seeing the two agents closing in from both sides, Li Tianran maneuvered and seized the opportunity to throw one of them down with a bear hug.
1:48:10|1:48:29|Li Tianran was knocked out by his high kick, and a special agent appeared behind him. Upstairs, Guan Qiaohong pulled out her gun and shot accurately, just as Lao Pan fell down. Guan Qiaohong quickly went downstairs to check the situation, only to find that Lao Pan was already dead, with two bayonets stabbed in his back.
1:48:29|1:48:35|Supporting his body from falling down, he managed to deceive the two. [Li Tianran] pulled out the dagger stuck in his back and threw it on the ground.
1:48:44|1:48:54|[Guan Qiaohong] had red eyes and trembling lips as he handed the samurai sword to [Li Tianran].
1:48:56|1:49:5|[Li Tianran] took the samurai sword and ran out the door, leaving [Guan Qiaohong] in tears.
1:49:5|1:49:28|Meanwhile, [Lan Qingfeng] was being beaten up in the living room. Upon receiving the news, [Genben Ichiro] hurriedly left the house, drove to the Sun Altar, followed by a military police truck. The two cars drove out of the city gate, heading towards the outskirts for a duel. He was determined to win.
1:49:28|1:49:49|At dusk, at Lan Qingfeng's home, Lan Qingfeng did not compromise and was still hanging upside down in the air. Outside the city, Li Tianran stood in the center of the Sun Temple, holding Genben Ichiro's samurai sword. A cool breeze blew in as the sky darkened. Genben Ichiro's car slowly drove into the Sun Temple, where Li Tianran had been waiting for a long time.
1:50:25|1:50:32|[Li Tianran] threw the samurai sword, which was caught by [Genben Ichiro]. After a moment of scrutiny, [Genben Ichiro] mocked [Li Tianran]'s arrogance, intending to let him die quickly and painlessly.
1:50:34|1:50:49|The two kept moving to adjust their positions, with [Genben Ichiro] shouting out, "First strike!" [Li Tianran] also gestured with his fingers to help him count. [Genben Ichiro] tightly gripped the scabbard with one hand and placed the other on the hilt, his eyes fixed firmly on the target as he slowly adjusted his pace and breathing.
1:50:49|1:51:20|[Li Tianran] watched alertly as [Genben Ichiro] continuously adjusted his grip on the knife. As the knife came down, [Li Tianran] dodged to the side. [Genben Ichiro] sheathed the knife as a truck stopped outside the Sun Altar. [Li Tianran] gestured for a second strike, while [Genben Ichiro] maintained a serious expression, adjusting his stance continuously. The two moved closer, and [Genben Ichiro] drew his sword.
1:51:21|1:51:26|[Li Tianran] twisted his waist to dodge the fast and fierce attack, infuriating [Genben Ichiro] who shouted for a third strike.
1:51:32|1:51:55|[Li Tianran] was constantly leaping around like Bruce Lee, while [Genben Ichiro] held his sword horizontally in front of him, closely watching for an opportunity. Suddenly, [Genben Ichiro] charged forward, missing with three consecutive strikes before finally landing a downward chop that injured [Li Tianran]'s left arm. [Genben Ichiro] then raised his long sword high and brought it down from above.
1:51:55|1:52:6|The powerful blow forced [Li Tianran] to cross his hands and block the knife handle, using it to break [Genben Ichiro]'s ankle. [Genben Ichiro] kept retreating, while [Li Tianran] pursued and defeated him with three punches and two kicks.
1:52:14|1:52:20|After a burst of gunfire, the entire army on the truck was wiped out, with [Li Tianran] sneering, "I am more cunning than you."
1:52:21|1:52:27|[Li Tianran] drove to the door and found that it was [Guan Qiaohong] who helped him kill the military police.
1:52:29|1:52:36|[Li Tianran] wasted no time and drove away. [Guan Qiaohong] said to her subordinates. The car arrived at the doorstep of [Genben Ichiro]'s house.
1:52:38|1:52:42|[Li Tianran] carried [Genben Ichiro] closer,
1:53:16|1:53:41|[Zhu Qianlong] called [Genben Ichiro]'s home, while [Li Tianran] sat in front of the phone eating noodles without any reaction. [Zhu Qianlong] hung up and personally extracted a tooth for [Lan Qingfeng]. He then dialed [Genben Ichiro]'s home again, but this time [Li Tianran] answered.
1:54:1|1:54:6|[Zhu Qianlong] drove to [Genben Ichiro]'s house, he pushed the door and walked quickly calling out for [Genben Ichiro] in the courtyard.
1:54:12|1:54:26|The Imperial Army has arrived, as Zhu Qianlong approaches with quick steps, he becomes alert upon seeing Genben Ichiro's bloodied face. Li Tianran enters through the door, causing Zhu Qianlong to nervously step back, his hand resting on his waist.
1:55:46|1:55:55|[Zhu Qianlong] gestured with his hand as if holding a gun, but [Li Tianran] pulled out a revolver and pointed it at [Zhu Qianlong].
1:56:24|1:56:40|Both of them leaped up simultaneously, throwing a punch in the air before landing. They stood still and jumped up again, exchanging a kick in mid-air. After landing once more, they assumed their stances. Facing each other, they dodged each other's moves with precision, knowing each other's techniques like the back of their hands.
1:56:48|1:56:58|The two circled around [Genben Ichiro]'s chair, groaning [Genben Ichiro] was knocked unconscious by a punch from [Li Tianran]. The two martial brothers exchanged blows like the wind, countering each other's moves for dozens of rounds.
1:56:58|1:57:20|The situation became even more intense as both Li Tianran and Zhu Qianlong grabbed each other's collars without prior agreement. Genben Ichiro stood up and shouted, only to be kicked unconscious by Li Tianran. The two pushed each other away and locked legs until they each landed a kick on the other, finally separating.
1:57:29|1:57:53|The two started moving their muscles again, [Li Tianran] reached out provocatively, then ran towards the house. [Zhu Qianlong] chased directly, just as [Li Tianran] had run a few steps in the corridor, [Zhu Qianlong] crashed through the window and pounced in, blocking the way. [Zhu Qianlong] flipped over, his face covered in broken glass. The senior brother made another leap but was opened by the junior brother. The junior brother threw the glass, which stuck in the senior brother's buttocks.
1:57:55|1:58:12|Junior brother leaped out of the window and started punching and kicking his senior brother who was running away with his head in his arms, displaying a set of thuggish moves. Senior brother, not to be outdone, kicked him in the crotch, causing junior brother to retreat and fall down. Senior brother then delivered a series of headbutts to his forehead. The two then stood up again and continued to exchange punches without dodging each other.
1:58:55|1:59:21|Another round of punches landed on [Li Tianran]'s face, grabbing his fingers and using all his strength to swing him around. [Li Tianran] jumped up, kicking [Zhu Qianlong] hard in the chest. [Zhu Qianlong] could only grab and throw [Li Tianran] away, then ran to the corridor. [Li Tianran] quickly got up and chased after him. [Zhu Qianlong] escaped to the window, climbed onto the roof, and ran frantically. Unexpectedly, [Li Tianran] intercepted him from the other side.
1:59:27|1:59:51|Senior Brother turned around and ran back, but was hugged by Junior Brother and rolled onto the eaves. The two of them fought and kicked each other away again. They both got up with the help of roof tiles, poised for a fight, and then slowly moved forward. Both reached out their hands to signal, both with sinister intentions, and simultaneously used headbutts to strike each other's heads.
1:59:51|2:0:1|Junior Brother couldn't bear a bear hug, and the two fell on the tiles. Seizing the opportunity, Senior Brother locked his throat from behind.
2:0:23|2:0:40|The junior brother half-knelt and exerted force to pull the senior brother's leg. In the struggle, the two of them reached the edge of the roof. The junior brother kicked the roof, and they both fell down together, with dust and soil falling from the roof onto them.
2:0:40|2:0:52|In the courtyard, [Li Tianran] was nowhere to be seen. As the senior brothers lying on the ground briefly lost consciousness, [Genben Ichiro] rushed out of the house with a knife and attacked [Li Tianran].
2:1:0|2:1:13|The crazy [Genben Ichiro] muttered to himself, then rushed forward with a knife in hand, stabbing his senior brother in the chest.
2:1:32|2:1:48|He killed [Genben Ichiro] with a single stroke of the knife, then the junior brother pulled the senior brother up from the ground, put a gun against his head, and pulled the trigger.
2:2:36|2:2:39|The senior brother cried, but the junior brother smiled and let go.
2:2:52|2:3:28|The bullet passed through the head of Senior Brother, a drop of blood dripped under the name of [Li Tianran] forming four dots. The junior brother wiped off the remaining three dots with his hand, and the car drove back to the back door of the Lan family. [Lan Qingfeng]'s teeth were pulled out, and as he walked to the door, [Li Tianran] picked up the teeth. [Li Tianran] walked slowly forward, and the secret agents immediately stopped their actions, staring at [Li Tianran]. Suddenly, a secret agent threw an axe, but [Li Tianran] dodged it and shot the tooth into the eyeball.
2:3:28|2:3:43|Another secret agent stepped forward, [Li Tianran] with his fists and moves like the wind, either throwing or breaking necks, leaving the other agents helpless. [Li Tianran] pulled out his gun, loaded it and released the safety.
2:4:12|2:4:36|[Lan Qingfeng] signaled, [Li Tianran] wiped his forehead with tears in his eyes, then drove the car with [Lan Qingfeng] out of the back door of the Lan family, leaving in a cloud of dust.
2:4:37|2:5:1|From dusk till nightfall, the car slowly came to a stop. [Li Tianran] got out of the car and ran into a house. Shortly after, General Zhang walked out of the house. [Li Tianran] approached and opened the car door for him. General Zhang got into the car, and they drove past the shining streetlights. Inside the car were three people, with [Lan Qingfeng] lying in the back seat, his face covered in blood.
2:5:7|2:5:21|The car slowly drove towards the East Chang'an Avenue embassy district, passed the sentries, and slowly stopped in front of a beautiful building. General Zhang and [Li Tianran] looked at the door of the building as if waiting for something.
2:5:23|2:5:45|The exquisite gate remained silent for a long time. The two of them waited nervously. Suddenly, the door opened and a foreign couple walked out. The lady patted Li Tianran's face and gave him a tip, which Li Tianran casually threw onto the back seat of the car.
2:5:45|2:6:3|General Zhang saluted the two before entering the door, and they returned the salute. The car left the embassy area in time. Unexpectedly, they were stopped by the Japanese. The Japanese approached to inspect, and Li Tianran reached for his gun.
2:6:15|2:6:24|But before he could escape the shooting, the Japanese pointed a gun at [Li Tianran], questioning why he was still wearing Japanese clothes.
2:6:36|2:6:57|He called his companions to see the Chinese donkey, and [Li Tianran] twisted his neck. A companion rushed over with a bayonet, but was knocked down by [Li Tianran] with a punch. [Li Tianran] picked up the gun stock and smashed it down fiercely, and the car started again and disappeared into the night.
2:6:58|2:7:15|In the early morning, the Japanese troops marched towards the gates of Beiping. Japanese women on the city walls waved flags and cheered, while journalists below crowded around to take photos. Amidst the enthusiastic cheers, the Japanese troops entered the city through Chaoyang Gate.
2:7:47|2:8:19|[Li Tianran] frowned and asked [Doctor Hendler] to cure him. After speaking, [Li Tianran] shoveled coal into the fire to make it burn brightly. In the puzzled eyes of the fat man, [Li Tianran] ran back to the car, angrily carrying the Japanese man who was killed last night, and then walked to the furnace to throw him in.
2:8:20|2:8:57|[Li Tianran] patted the fat man, then turned and walked away quickly. The fat man picked up the coal ball, making the fire even stronger, and black smoke rose from the chimney. [Tang Fengyi], in pajamas, walked along the city wall, passing through the cheering Japanese women. Japanese soldiers climbed onto the stone lions below the city wall. [Tang Fengyi] stood at the top of the city wall. [Li Tianran] crawled out of the window and was stunned to see the tailor's shop on fire.
2:8:57|2:9:23|Under the city wall, a Japanese soldier demanded the journalist to take a photo of him. [Tang Fengyi] jumped down from the wall and hit him. On the archway, [Li Tianran] ran towards the tailor's shop. The present [Li Tianran] has avenged his great hatred, and he feels extremely relaxed and content without the burden of hatred. This trip to Beiping has been fulfilled in his heart.
2:9:23|2:9:40|He ran briskly, the green plants adorning the archway did not hinder his speed at all. In his mind, he only wanted to dash to the tailor's shop. [Li Tianran] who came running from the archway was panting, looking at [Guan Qiaohong].
2:11:56|2:12:3|[Li Tianran] had tears in his eyes, [Guan Qiaohong] turned away with tears streaming down her face, [Guan Qiaohong] shook her head.
