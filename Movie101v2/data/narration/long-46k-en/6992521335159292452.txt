0:2:59|0:3:18|Xiaoyun paid no attention to what [Zhang Daichen] wanted to say, and with a bang, she closed the door, locked the security door, leaned her forehead and body against the door, stood there with dull eyes for a while, then turned around to look around the room, and lowered her head to count while walking forward.
0:3:27|0:3:52|In the room, a woman with a ring on her ring finger lay in a pool of blood. Xiaoyun walked past her very calmly, then suddenly stopped in her tracks. She looked up at the clock on the wall, which showed the time as 9:05. She then turned and walked past another man's body into the room, calmly picked up the phone.
0:3:53|0:4:0|The screen suddenly goes black, and the four characters of the title "Memory Master" appear on the screen, the movie begins.
0:4:1|0:4:21|The male protagonist [Jiang Feng] got up alone in the middle of the night and walked to the cloakroom. He stopped in front of a glass cabinet, lowered his head, pursed his lips, and entered the password in the dark to open the safe. [Jiang Feng] looked around and then secretly reached out to put something inside.
0:4:21|0:4:33|He looked at the contents in the safe for a few seconds, sighed, then closed the safe and walked out. [Jiang Feng] passed by the bed where his wife was sleeping soundly.
0:4:33|0:4:51|After he left the room, his wife [Zhang Daichen] slowly opened her eyes. The sky was getting brighter, and in a city in T country with tall buildings, a uniquely shaped building appeared on the screen. [Jiang Feng] was led by a staff member into an operating room.
0:4:57|0:5:3|[Jiang Feng] stood in front of a machine. He turned around and sat on the chair of the machine, slowly closing his eyes.
0:5:12|0:5:19|A circular metal device surrounds the head of [Jiang Feng], and the memory deletion surgery officially begins.
0:5:19|0:5:41|Scenes of black and white flash suddenly in Jiang Feng's mind, hands raising glasses in celebration, a divorce agreement, he colliding with his wife Zhang Daichen, manuscripts scattered and flying in the air. He squats down to pick up the manuscripts, and Zhang Daichen helps him pick them up as well. They exchange smiles, and the scene freezes on a page of manuscript with the title "Night Rain".
0:5:41|0:6:3|The screen flickers and returns to reality. [Jiang Feng] opens his eyes. A staff member reaches out to remove the memory chip from the device, and [Jiang Feng] shakes his head.
0:6:7|0:6:20|[Jiang Feng] raised his left hand, and a staff member drew a tube of blood from the inside of his wrist. [Jiang Feng] glanced at the staff member, who seemed somewhat dazed.
0:6:36|0:6:44|[Jiang Feng] took the metal box from the staff's hand.
0:6:57|0:7:4|[Jiang Feng] slowed down his pace and looked around as he walked out.
0:7:58|0:8:17|The scene was chaotic, with [Jiang Feng] and the female staff next to him crouching on the ground, motionless. The man gradually calmed down, gripping the woman's arm tightly and staring at her. Then he spoke, while the woman's face was filled with fear. She looked at the man in front of her for a long time without saying a word.
0:8:26|0:8:42|The man pleaded with a sorrowful expression, and the woman looked at him and spoke. The woman, with her hair loose, took a deep breath and weakly said,
0:8:44|0:9:1|[Jiang Feng] looked at the man and woman not far away with a puzzled expression. The man hesitated for a few seconds, then hugged the woman tightly in the hall. Tears rolled down the woman's eyes as the man held her and spoke,
0:9:7|0:9:32|The man raised his gun-holding right hand to his temple, closed his eyes tightly, and pulled the trigger. Bullets pierced through the temples of the two people, dropping to the ground. The two fell down embracing each other, causing people to panic and scatter in all directions. Beside them, [Jiang Feng] seemed to be scared silly, gasping for breath and collapsing on the ground. A broken metal box hung nearby, with a memory chip flashing. He then returned home, where his wife [Zhang Daichen] sat silently by the side.
0:10:45|0:11:1|[Jiang Feng] stood with his back to [Zhang Daichen], coldly recounting their past together. The couple stood in silence in the empty living room.
0:11:1|0:11:16|[Jiang Feng] returned to the memory master's operating room again. The operator stood aside manipulating the data. He closed his eyes tightly, lying on the seat of the instrument. The female staff member who had served him before placed the memory chip into the device, and then activated the instrument.
0:11:22|0:11:35|The machinery operated slowly, a drop of blue liquid fell from the device and landed in the right eye of [Jiang Feng], spreading out as his pupils turned blue. The surgery ended, and the scene shifted to the medical room.
0:12:27|0:12:53|[Jiang Feng] hesitated for a moment before speaking, but was interrupted by [Zhang Daichen] sitting next to him. As the night grew darker, [Jiang Feng] sat at the bedside staring at a bottle of sleeping pills in his hand. He expressionlessly caressed the bottle for a while, then unscrewed the cap and swallowed a pill dry.
0:12:53|0:13:8|Outside the window, the city lights were bright. [Jiang Feng] lay on the sofa in front of the French window and fell into a deep sleep. In his dream, a black and white scene suddenly appeared, where he walked into a dilapidated village with overgrown weeds everywhere.
0:13:8|0:13:23|He walked to a wooden house, took out a key and opened the door. Inside, the woman heard the noise, hurriedly hung up the phone, then turned around to look at him. [Jiang Feng] closed the door and walked into the room, the woman smiled and walked towards him.
0:13:33|0:13:55|[Jiang Feng] finished speaking and walked past the woman to the telephone to make a call. The woman was stunned. After hanging up the phone, [Jiang Feng] raised the cup of water in his hand and took a sip. Then he turned to the side, remained silent for a moment, and spoke.
0:14:2|0:14:20|The phone rang again, and Hui Lan quickly turned to look at the telephone. [Jiang Feng] lowered his head and walked away from the phone, drinking water while waiting for the other party to make a decision. Hui Lan glanced at [Jiang Feng], then quickly stepped forward to unplug the phone line. Holding the phone, she looked up at [Jiang Feng] and spoke.
0:14:22|0:14:28|The scene changes, [Jiang Feng] pushes open the door with a stack of books in his arms, while Huilan is ready to go out with a backpack.
0:14:38|0:15:7|Huilan turned and left, [Jiang Feng] stood at the door blankly, looking a bit lost. The scene then cut to the bathroom, where a man faced the bathtub with his back to the camera, crouching down. Inside the bathtub, there was a person with one hand and one leg hanging outside. The scene switched back to the house entrance, [Jiang Feng] held a stack of books and handed a key to Huilan. Huilan raised her hand to take the key, then turned to unlock the door and walked out. [Jiang Feng] stood aside, expressionless, watching him leave.
0:15:10|0:15:19|The scene cuts again, [Jiang Feng] walks into the bathroom alone, squats beside the bathtub, bows his head to look at the bathtub, only to see it filled with water, inside lies a dead body.
0:15:19|0:15:34|The body was floating in the water, the face was not visible, only one arm and one leg were exposed. At this moment, Jiang Feng, who was sleeping, suddenly woke up from the nightmare. His eyes widened in fear, and after dawn, Jiang Feng returned to the hospital again.
0:16:13|0:16:20|[The doctor] looked at [Jiang Feng] with a disdainful smile, then stood up, leaning over the table with both hands and said.
0:17:18|0:17:43|[Jiang Feng] stood up instantly, his mind racing with images of Li Huilan's face. He suddenly pushed the [doctor] to the ground. Meanwhile, on the big screen at the police station, three photos of Li Huilan covered in bruises were displayed, flashing back to her speaking on the hospital bed.
0:18:16|0:18:21|Officer Shen suddenly walked over, and Officer Lei quickly picked up the signed document by Chen Shanshan and left.
0:18:33|0:18:55|[Jiang Feng] suddenly appeared in the police station at this moment. He turned his head to look at Chen Shanshan and [Officer Shen] chatting, then saw a photo of Li Huilan on the table. He took a few quick steps forward, bent over to look at the photo on the table. In the photo, Li Huilan's eyes were tightly closed, with a wound on her forehead. As soon as Officer Lei turned around, he saw [Jiang Feng] staring blankly at the photo.
0:19:7|0:19:13|[Jiang Feng] took a few steps with a hesitant expression, then turned around to speak to Officer Lei's back.
0:20:7|0:20:13|Officer Shen looked at Jiang Feng without saying a word for a long time, then they entered the interrogation room.
0:20:21|0:20:33|[Jiang Feng] recalled and narrated the memories in his mind, while Officer Lei sat aside taking notes, and [Officer Shen] asked questions.
0:20:44|0:20:49|Officer Shen looked up at [Jiang Feng],
0:21:38|0:22:0|Officer Lei finished speaking and then left, closing the door behind him. In the empty interrogation room, two desk lamps were lit. [Jiang Feng] rubbed his eyes alone, and suddenly a new image appeared in his mind: a woman standing on the first floor making a phone call, while [Jiang Feng] stood on the second floor looking down at her.
0:22:20|0:22:43|A long-haired woman with a face full of injuries suddenly stood up from the sofa. Ignoring the attempts to stop her from [Jiang Feng] and her sister, she insisted on walking out. Outside the door, a man was sitting on the ground, holding his hand, with one finger already chopped off by him. The ground was covered in blood.
0:22:51|0:23:13|The woman with long hair stood aside with luggage, nodded by the middle-aged woman referred to as "mom" by the man. The woman moved her mouth but made no sound. The man stood up and spoke to the woman with long hair. He tried to take the bag from her hand, but the woman with long hair stepped back in fear. [Jiang Feng] on the side looked up at them. The man spoke to [Jiang Feng], and [Jiang Feng] looked at him.
0:23:15|0:23:33|The man drove quickly on the highway with a long-haired woman and [Jiang Feng]. The woman with long hair sat in the passenger seat, tears in her eyes, trembling, and stealing glances at [Jiang Feng] from the rearview mirror. The man's severed finger was placed in a plastic bag filled with ice and water, but he did not slow down; instead, he drove faster and faster.
0:23:44|0:24:5|A scene of a woman drowning suddenly flashes, followed by a man driving the car out of the alley and onto the dock, then slamming on the brakes. Half of the car is suspended on a high platform. At this moment, the scene flashes back to [Jiang Feng] and the long-haired woman playing in the field. The man gets out of the car alone and goes crazy on the side, while the long-haired woman and [Jiang Feng] sit in the car without moving.
0:24:21|0:24:28|The man slammed the long-haired woman's head against the car, then grabbed her hair and angrily spoke.
0:24:34|0:24:51|Sitting in the back, [Jiang Feng] was so scared that he wet his pants, still not daring to say a word. A hand with a ring on the ring finger and a bleeding index finger, along with a drowned woman, suddenly appeared in [Jiang Feng]'s mind. He woke up abruptly in the interrogation room and sat there in a daze. On the other side, Officer Shen took out a file from the archives and read it as he walked.
0:25:42|0:25:53|Officer Shen glanced at the old man, then handed the wallet to Officer Lei, who walked over to the old man, while Jiang Feng once again entered the interrogation room.
0:26:23|0:26:30|[Jiang Feng] furrowed his brow as he struggled to recall the numbers from his memory.
0:26:38|0:26:44|Officer Lei whispered something in [Officer Shen]'s ear, leaving [Jiang Feng] looking confused and ready to leave.
0:26:51|0:27:1|The two turned their heads to look at [Officer Shen],
0:27:10|0:27:17|Officer Shen handed the documents to Officer Lei as he took off his coat and walked out.
0:27:32|0:27:39|The police officer locked the door and left. [Jiang Feng] stood with his back to the door in the cell, with another prisoner in the corner.
0:27:44|0:27:54|[Jiang Feng] glanced at him without saying a word, while the criminal next to him looked curious. [Jiang Feng] nodded at him.
0:28:55|0:29:0|The criminal had just sat down, but immediately stood up again, walking up to [Jiang Feng] and staring at him with wide eyes.
0:29:5|0:29:12|[Jiang Feng] sighed, then turned his head and walked to the side, while the criminal looked at him, sneered, and also walked away behind him.
0:29:16|0:29:27|In the police station, [Officer Shen] and Officer Lei are watching the video from the day of the shooting at the Memory Master Surgery Center on the surveillance footage.
0:29:34|0:29:41|[Jiang Feng] was crouching in front of a black-clothed person wearing a hat, as if picking something up, while [Officer Shen] sat leaning against the table and blinked.
0:29:46|0:29:56|Officer Shen turned and left after speaking. Officer Lei looked at the surveillance footage again, and [Jiang Feng] in the prison once again fell into a black and white dream. Li Huilan opened the door, and [Jiang Feng] stood outside receiving a phone call.
0:30:13|0:30:33|[Jiang Feng] walked towards the room, [Li Huilan] hurriedly caught up with her. [Jiang Feng] looked at the wound on [Li Huilan]'s head, touched her hair. [Li Huilan] slapped [Jiang Feng]'s hand away, the knocking on the door became more urgent. [Li Huilan] pulled [Jiang Feng] and pushed him upstairs.
0:30:40|0:30:56|[Jiang Feng] was pushed into the room on the second floor. He stood still at the door, seemingly listening to the commotion downstairs. [Li Huilan] closed the door and went downstairs. She opened the security door, took a step back, and let her husband in. Her husband walked into the room and looked around.
0:30:57|0:31:12|After a moment of silence, Jiang Feng's husband turned around and staggered into the house, leaning against the wall. He glanced back at Jiang Feng, then continued to look around while walking inside, as if searching for something.
0:31:12|0:31:35|[Lee Huilan] stood at the door, keeping still with her previous actions. After a few quiet seconds, [Lee Huilan]'s husband suddenly went crazy. He violently slammed [Lee Huilan] against the wall and she fell to the ground. She lay there in a sorry state, begging for mercy, while her husband grabbed her by the neck and roared.
0:31:40|0:32:6|[Li Huilan] struggled and kicked her husband hard, causing his head to hit the wall and pass out. Terrified, she quickly ran upstairs. At that moment, [Jiang Feng] also came out of the house, patted [Li Huilan] on the shoulder, then went downstairs to squat beside her husband. He silently looked at the man in front of him with closed eyes and reached out to feel for his breath.
0:32:14|0:32:19|[Jiang Feng] ran to [Li Huilan]'s side, supporting her shoulder to comfort her. [Li Huilan] collapsed in [Jiang Feng]'s arms, wailing loudly.
0:32:29|0:32:36|[Li Huilan] shook her head on [Jiang Feng]'s shoulder, then backed out of his arms.
0:32:42|0:32:54|[Jiang Feng] watched as [Li Huilan] helplessly swallowed and then took out his phone from his pocket to make a call. Just as he was about to dial, [Li Huilan] shook her head and stopped him.
0:33:5|0:33:21|[Li Huilan] looked at [Jiang Feng] with a pleading expression, as [Jiang Feng] reached out to touch [Li Huilan]'s forehead.
0:33:42|0:34:5|[Jiang Feng] looked a bit sad, [Li Huilan] lowered her head to dodge, [Jiang Feng] didn't leave, but took a step forward to touch [Li Huilan]'s cheek again. Tears welled up in [Jiang Feng]'s eyes as [Li Huilan] looked at him with a helpless bitter smile.
0:34:14|0:34:26|[Li Huilan] pushed away [Jiang Feng]'s hand, [Jiang Feng] looked at her in disbelief, then raised his arm and forcefully pushed [Li Huilan] down the stairs.
0:34:26|0:34:36|[Li Huilan] rolled down the stairs to the first floor, lying on the ground holding her head in pain and groaning. [Jiang Feng] stared at her for a while, then slowly walked down from upstairs.
0:34:36|0:34:49|[Li Huilan] struggled to get up, her hands on the ground, she turned her head towards the stairs upon hearing [Jiang Feng]'s footsteps. However, she suddenly found her vision becoming blurry, and she crawled forward with effort, as if searching for something.
0:34:49|0:35:15|[Jiang Feng] put on white disposable plastic gloves as he walked downstairs. He approached [Li Huilan], bent down to pick up the wine bottle wrapped in a paper bag on the ground, then raised the bottle and forcefully struck it down towards [Li Huilan]'s head. [Li Huilan] screamed in pain and fell to the ground. [Jiang Feng]'s face was filled with indifference as he turned and walked over to [Li Huilan]'s unconscious husband, bending down to place the wine bottle on the ground.
0:35:15|0:35:26|[Li Huilan] struggled to sit up from the ground and glanced at [Jiang Feng], then with a face full of fear, she sobbed and crawled to the side, while [Jiang Feng] took a few steps forward slowly.
0:35:26|0:35:50|Then stopped in front of [Li Huilan], [Li Huilan] was lying on the ground, hands grabbing [Jiang Feng]'s ankles, looking at him pleadingly. However, [Jiang Feng]'s expression was terrifyingly cold. [Li Huilan] became even more frightened, she let go of his hands and crawled to the side faster. [Jiang Feng] bent down, grabbed [Li Huilan], and forcefully covered her nose and mouth. [Li Huilan] struggled desperately, kicking her legs on the ground, and using her hands to hit [Jiang Feng]'s arms.
0:35:50|0:36:0|[Jiang Feng]'s gaze seemed to be looking at nothing, but his hands were becoming more forceful. [Li Huilan] gradually stopped struggling, her eyes losing their sparkle.
0:36:0|0:36:17|A few tears fell from [Jiang Feng]'s eyes, dropping into [Li Huilan]'s eyes. [Li Huilan] slowly closed her eyes, a tear slid down from the corner of her eye. [Jiang Feng] pressed his face against [Li Huilan]'s head, opened his mouth and cried silently. The scene cut back to the prison.
0:36:17|0:36:31|In reality, [Jiang Feng] had his eyes tightly closed, with a slight frown on his face and tears streaming down. He slowly opened his eyes while curled up in a corner of the prison, then raised his hand to cover his throbbing head, while another inmate squatted in front of him.
0:37:7|0:37:22|[Jiang Feng] stoops down to pick up something from the ground. Officer Shen sticks a photo on the glass wall, showing a black-clothed person wearing a hat.
0:38:28|0:38:47|[Jiang Feng] turned sharply to look at the prisoner beside him, his eyes sharp and terrifying. The prisoner was immediately scared into silence, his smile frozen on his face. The sky outside the prison appeared somewhat misty. The streets were still bustling with traffic. [Officer Shen] stood in silence, lost in thought at Li Huilan's house, when Officer Lei walked over.
0:39:14|0:39:28|Officer Shen pointed upstairs, and Officer Lei hurriedly ran upstairs. Officer Shen stood alone at the stairwell, looking around. He glanced at the room, then turned and walked to the corner, leaning against the wall and silently watching downstairs.
0:39:28|0:39:41|Officer Lei walked into the room on the second floor, opened a drawer and began searching for something. He turned around and looked around, took a step forward, walked to the desk, put his hands on the table, and then pulled out a book called "Silent Bird" from the bookshelf.
0:39:41|0:39:53|At the staircase outside the room, Officer Shen lay on the ground with his head parallel to the floor, looking down along the carpet. Suddenly, Officer Lei jumped in front of Officer Shen with the book he had just held.
0:40:2|0:40:30|Officer Shen was pushed and rolled down the stairs like Li Huilan. He struggled to get up, but as soon as he managed to sit up, he froze. Officer Shen pointed towards the steps on the ground, and [Officer Shen] saw this and wiped the smile off his face. He walked down the stairs, knelt on one knee, bent down, and picked up something from the gap in the stairs. He pinched it with his fingers, blew on it,
0:40:30|0:40:51|Then Jiang Feng picked up the book that had just rolled down with Officer Lei, the author of the book. Officer Shen picked up a pair of invisible glasses lenses. Officer Lei then knocked on the door next door, and a woman came out. Officer Lei showed his police badge to the woman, who was a bit angry.
0:41:50|0:41:56|Mrs. Zhang and [Officer Shen] both turned their gaze to Officer Lei, who was applying ice to reduce the swelling and pain.
0:42:45|0:43:4|Mrs. Zhang sat on the sofa, talking animatedly. Meanwhile, in the prison, [Jiang Feng] was pacing anxiously, while another inmate sat idly by. [Jiang Feng] raised his hand to touch the back of his head, then sat down next to the inmate. After a moment of silence, he sighed and turned to look at the inmate beside him, hesitated for a moment, and then asked,
0:43:38|0:43:54|The criminal chuckled and shook his tattered work vest, thinking that [Jiang Feng] was joking. However, [Jiang Feng] remained expressionless, his face serious. He moved closer to the criminal, his eyes sharp, and raised his right hand to ask the criminal for something.
0:44:0|0:44:25|The night darkens, the scene shifts from the prison to outside. Officer Lei and [Officer Shen] sit in the car. Officer Lei checks the time, removes the flashing warning light from the roof of the car, and then rolls down the window. [Officer Shen], sitting in the driver's seat, rolls down the window and opens the door, getting out. Officer Lei sighs helplessly as he watches this.
0:44:28|0:44:36|The scene cuts back to the prison, where a prisoner takes out a very thin blade from the worn-out pocket of his pants and hands it to [Jiang Feng].
0:44:54|0:45:8|[Jiang Feng] didn't reply, but instead pondered silently while holding the blade wrapped in tape in his hand. After a moment, he turned around to face the criminal, locked eyes for a few seconds, and then spoke earnestly with the blade in hand.
0:45:18|0:45:39|The criminal tried to grab the blade, but [Jiang Feng] held it tightly. Seeing the situation was not going well, the criminal quickly called for help from the police. [Jiang Feng] forcefully shoved the blade into the criminal's mouth, then swiftly covered his mouth with both hands. The criminal's face was filled with fear as he struggled desperately on the reclining chair.
0:45:42|0:45:45|Two prison guards ran over, with the criminal firmly suppressed by [Jiang Feng], his mouth full of blood.
0:45:55|0:46:12|[Jiang Feng] took advantage of the chaos to run out, locking the gate behind him after escaping from the prison. He completely ignored the calls of the guards behind him, without hesitation he lowered his head and walked out. When he reached the office area outside the prison, no one felt anything wrong. As he was about to leave the police station, he suddenly saw his wife [Zhang Daichen].
0:46:34|0:46:37|Shanshan suddenly appeared from behind, hugged [Jiang Feng]'s neck, and brought him down to the ground.
0:47:18|0:47:24|Zhang Daichen had no choice but to give up, while [Jiang Feng] was once again handcuffed by the police in the transparent prison, and [Officer Shen] walked over alone.
0:48:22|0:48:32|[Jiang Feng] turned his head to the side and slowly calmed down. [Officer Shen] looked at him, then walked to the bench and sat down with a sigh, his hands in his pockets.
0:48:48|0:48:55|Outside the prison, [Zhang Daichen] arrives at the infirmary, where Officer Chen Shan Shan is helping him clean his wounds.
0:49:14|0:49:36|[Zhang Daichen] shook his head slightly, hesitated for a moment, nodded at Chen Shanshan, Officer Shen stood outside the prison cell looking at [Jiang Feng], [Jiang Feng] slowly turned around, he slowly turned his body to look at [Officer Shen],
0:49:48|0:49:52|[Jiang Feng] furrowed his brow, he gave a helpless bitter smile, then spoke,
0:50:8|0:50:25|Officer Shen turned and left the prison after speaking. Jiang Feng stared blankly at Officer Shen's back until the sound of the door closing. He then lay down. The lights in the cell went out, and Jiang Feng closed his eyes. In an instant, he was once again plunged into the black and white dream, back to the night when Li Huilan was murdered.
0:50:25|0:50:33|Li Huilan's husband was pinching her neck and questioning her. [Jiang Feng] was hiding alone on the second floor, afraid to make a sound.
0:50:47|0:50:54|Jiang Feng's daughter, Li Xiaoyun, is waving at him at the door. He turns around and enters Li Xiaoyun's room.
0:51:2|0:51:28|He opened the door, ready to go out, but was stopped by Li Xiaoyun shaking her head with tears on her face. [Jiang Feng] closed the door, supported Li Xiaoyun's shoulder, and let her sit on the bed. Looking into her eyes, he comforted her gently. [Jiang Feng] put the earphones from Li Xiaoyun's neck onto her head, then stared into her eyes, comforting her, as if time had suddenly stopped.
0:51:28|0:51:37|After a moment, [Jiang Feng] shifted his body and suddenly noticed another version of himself staring at Li Xiaoyun on his right side.
0:51:40|0:52:1|He was completely stunned, eyes wide open and mouth agape, looking at everything in front of him in astonishment. He approached the motionless other self and [Li Xiaoyun] sitting on the bed, reaching out to touch [Li Xiaoyun]'s hair, only to find it stiff like metal. It turned out that everything in the room had already frozen in time.
0:52:1|0:52:28|[Jiang Feng] turned and left the room to go downstairs. He saw [Li Huilan] lying on the ground with a pool of blood in front of her. Another [Jiang Feng] stood on the side watching him. [Li Huilan]'s husband was in a corner leaning against the wall, his condition unknown. [Jiang Feng] took a few steps forward and a corridor appeared on the wall in an infinite loop. He looked down and the open book on the table also displayed interlocking characters, everything seemed very eerie.
0:52:28|0:52:52|The sound of the door closing, [Jiang Feng] immediately turned around and saw [Li Xiaoyun] coming down from the second floor. The [Jiang Feng] who killed [Li Huilan] looked up at [Li Xiaoyun] with a blank expression, not saying a word. [Li Xiaoyun] walked down the steps, looking at her mother lying in a pool of blood and her father leaning against the wall in critical condition. She choked up and couldn't speak for a long time. The killer [Jiang Feng] remained silent.
0:52:52|0:52:58|[Jiang Feng] on the other side lowered his head silently. He looked up at [Li Xiaoyun].
0:52:59|0:53:33|[Li Xiaoyun] slowly spoke, with disheveled hair scattered on both sides of her temples. She looked up at [Jiang Feng] standing next to her mother's body and spoke again. The room was quiet, only the ticking of the clock hands and [Li Xiaoyun]'s choked voice could be heard. She bent down next to her mother's body, her eyes filled with sadness. [Jiang Feng], the one who had killed, still bowed his head in silence. Suddenly, he turned to look at [Zhang Daichen] standing beside him. After a few seconds of eye contact, he flashed a sinister smile at him.
0:53:33|0:53:56|[Jiang Feng] was startled, took a few steps back unsteadily, turned around and ran out. In the instant [Jiang Feng] turned around, the scene quickly switched to the seaside, where the long-haired woman with a face full of wounds that he had dreamed of before was standing in the water smiling at him. At this moment, the long-haired woman had no wounds on her face. She put her hand in the water and randomly picked up a small goldfish.
0:53:56|0:54:0|The goldfish floated in the air above her hands, looking very magical.
0:54:0|0:54:30|The goldfish danced in the air, flying from the hands of the woman with long hair to [Jiang Feng]. Suddenly, the woman's husband appeared and they started fighting. [Jiang Feng] rushed forward to stop them, but not only did he fail to stop the woman's husband's violence, he was also pushed into the water by the man. He struggled in the water, using all his strength to keep his head above the surface. However, before he could even catch his breath, he was pushed back under the water again.
0:54:30|0:54:37|[Jiang Feng] struggled less and less, and just as he was on the brink of death, he suddenly left the water and stood up from the bathtub.
0:54:44|0:55:5|[Jiang Feng] was in a mess, gasping for breath as he looked around and realized he was in the bathroom he had dreamed of before. Suddenly, he turned his head and saw another himself standing in front of the bathtub, looking down at the body inside. He walked to the bathtub, glanced at the motionless other [Jiang Feng] beside it, and then looked down at the body in the bathtub.
0:55:5|0:55:12|Bending down, Jiang Feng reached out and touched the water in the bathtub, which was full of white foam. The water turned into a solid, and everything was frozen in place.
0:55:12|0:55:34|He was a little scared and wanted to run out of the bathroom, but when he turned around, he saw the same bathroom with the same scene. Countless bathrooms, countless Jiang Fengs, countless bathtubs and bodies were lined up there. He felt fear, running and shuttling in countless bathrooms. Suddenly, he stopped and walked to the mirror behind him, staring for a moment, raising his hand to wipe away the mist.
0:55:34|0:56:2|A terrifying scene unfolds as the mirror only reflects the dilapidated bathroom. [Jiang Feng], standing in front of the mirror, does not see himself and is startled. He quickly runs behind him, and the scene starts spinning as a rapid knocking sound echoes in his ears.
0:56:6|0:56:21|[Officer Shen] anxiously pounded on the transparent glass of the cell, [Jiang Feng] woke up from a deep sleep, sweating profusely, obviously frightened by everything that happened in his dream. He struggled to sit up, and talked to [Officer Shen] about the scenes in his dream.
0:57:29|0:57:36|Officer Shen looked puzzled, Jiang Feng sighed, then raised his hands to rub his eyes.
0:57:40|0:57:50|As the day broke, [Zhang Daichen] heard the doorbell and opened the door to find Officer Shen standing outside.
0:58:0|0:58:17|[Zhang Daichen] led Chen Shanshan into the room, then walked to the fridge with ointment in hand. She took out a bottle of drink from the fridge, and then turned around to get a cup.
0:58:34|0:58:42|Chen Shanshan placed the ticket on the table, then picked up a glass and took a sip of her drink.
0:59:0|0:59:8|As the sky darkened, Officer Shen and Officer Lei arrived at the library. Officer Lei bent down as he walked, searching for Jiang Feng's figure.
0:59:19|0:59:26|Sitting on both sides of [Jiang Feng], [Zhang Daichen] and [Officer Shen] tried to engage in conversation, but [Jiang Feng] was too focused on his homework to respond.
1:0:20|1:0:37|The two officers left the library, eating and chatting. Officer Shen picked up some ketchup and added it to his food, while Officer Jiang Feng pondered Officer Shen's question as he ate.
1:0:57|1:1:4|On the other side, [Zhang Daichen], who was staying at home, was sitting in the dining room talking on the phone with a lawyer.
1:1:8|1:1:15|[Zhang Daichen] breathed a sigh of relief after hanging up the phone, [Officer Shen] and Officer Lei returned to the police station. They sat inside the interrogation room, waiting.
1:1:24|1:1:57|Officer Shen crossed his legs and leaned back in the chair, as if someone was coming. A prison guard led in a man wearing gloves and ankle shackles, Li Hang, who ignored Officer Lei. Officer Lei knocked on the table, and Li Hang slowly raised his head.
1:2:28|1:2:39|[Li Hang] calmly answered Officer Lei's questions, leaving Officer Lei momentarily speechless. Officer Shen, sitting beside him, stared at [Li Hang] for a moment before sitting up straight and asking.
1:2:41|1:2:44|[Li Hang] sat at the table without saying a word, not answering Officer Shen's question.
1:2:44|1:3:10|Officer Shen waited for a while, then spoke again. Li Hang still didn't say anything. Officer Lei was getting impatient. Li Hang lowered his head, blinked his eyes, and moved his head a bit. He still looked lifeless. Officer Lei helplessly covered his head, while Officer Shen lowered his head and tapped the table with a pen.
1:3:13|1:3:32|Officer Shen suddenly stopped his actions and asked, Jiang Feng slowly raised his head to look at Officer Shen, who was also looking at him. They stared at each other for a while. Jiang Feng moved his lips, widened his eyes, and then slowly spoke,
1:3:33|1:3:56|He stared at [Officer Shen] without blinking, then let out a cold laugh. [Li Hang] and [Officer Shen] locked eyes for a moment, then turned away, his expression numb and sad, tears seemed to be rolling in his eyes but not falling, the scene gradually darkened from color to black and white.
1:3:56|1:4:18|[Jiang Feng] and the long-haired woman from before were playing and chasing each other in the wheat field. However, happiness is always short-lived. The once smiling long-haired woman suddenly lay in the bathtub with a face full of scars. He reached out to touch the wound at the corner of her eye, leaving a trace of blood on his hand. The faucet next to them kept dripping water, and tears also fell from the right eye of the long-haired woman.
1:4:18|1:4:36|She sat in the bathtub in silence, constantly rubbing her thumb and index finger together, bloodstains on her hands. [Jiang Feng] walked to the cabinet upon hearing this, reaching out in an attempt to grab the medicine bottle on the top shelf. He tried many times but still couldn't reach it.
1:4:36|1:4:52|He bent down in frustration and moved the low stool next to the cabinet, stepping on it to reach for the medicine bottle. At this height, he reached out and picked up a bottle of painkillers, looked at it, then put it back. He pushed the cabinet a little and then picked up another bottle, which contained sleeping pills.
1:4:54|1:5:19|[Li Hang] walked into the bathroom with pills and a cup of water in his hand. He stood by the bathtub, looked down at the pills and water, pursed his lips, and then reached out to hand the pills and cup to the long-haired woman lying in the bathtub. The woman took the pills without hesitation, and [Jiang Feng] stood by, lips slightly parted, with a hesitant expression. Her breathing became more and more rapid. The long-haired woman raised her right hand and squeezed [Jiang Feng]'s hand, signaling him to leave.
1:5:20|1:5:25|[Jiang Feng] held the hand of the woman with long hair for a while, then let go and slowly moved away step by step.
1:5:25|1:5:53|He walked to the door, looked back at the woman with long hair in the bathtub, then turned and closed the door. [Jiang Feng] didn't completely shut the door, but stood at the doorway, looking inside through a wide gap. Tears kept falling from the woman's face, she sighed, then closed her eyes and lay down in the bathtub to rest. With tears and bruises all over her body, she gradually fell asleep, her body slowly sinking down, and soon slipped into the filled bathtub.
1:5:53|1:6:16|[Jiang Feng] stood outside the door, watching everything happening in the bathroom. He saw with his own eyes the long-haired woman's head gradually being submerged in water. He stood outside the door, choked up, then quickly covered his mouth with his hand. The long-haired woman in the bathroom was completely lying in the water, and a few seconds later she began to struggle. Bubbles kept appearing from her mouth and nose as she desperately tried to break free from the water, but to no avail.
1:6:16|1:6:25|[Jiang Feng] outside the bathroom covers his mouth in sorrow, watching helplessly as the long-haired woman struggles in the bathtub until there is no movement.
1:6:25|1:6:54|He then walked into the bathroom and approached the bathtub. An arm and a leg emerged from the water, resting on the edge of the tub. [Jiang Feng] looked sadly at the body of the long-haired woman submerged in the water. Drop by drop, blood slipped from his palm into the tub. He squatted beside it, arms on the edge of the tub, crying uncontrollably. In his mind flashed the image of himself and the long-haired woman with a face full of wounds, nestled in a wheat field. The scene suddenly shifted between black and white dreams and reality.
1:6:54|1:7:9|Jiang Feng, who woke up from a dream, sat at his desk flipping through files desperately. He looked very focused as he examined photos of various female corpses scattered all over the desk and floor.
1:7:9|1:7:14|Officer Shen walked in with a teapot and stood in front of Jiang Feng, pouring tea as he spoke.
1:7:31|1:7:38|Officer Shen sat down across from Jiang Feng, picked up a teacup, and started drinking tea.
1:7:51|1:8:2|Officer Shen turned his body to the side and pondered for a moment before turning to look at Jiang Feng.
1:8:6|1:8:12|[Jiang Feng] felt a headache and he lay his head on the table.
1:8:56|1:9:3|Officer Shen snatched the documents.
1:9:11|1:9:33|[Jiang Feng] was taken out by the prison guard with a face full of anger, while on the other side, [Zhang Daichen], who was carefully dressed, arrived at the music hall. Officer Shen ran a few steps to catch up with [Zhang Daichen] and patted him on the back. The two held hands and walked upstairs to the police station office.
1:9:44|1:9:56|The scene returns to the music hall, where Chen Shanshan and [Zhang Daichen] found their seats and sat down. [Zhang Daichen] sighed, hesitated for a moment, looked around, and then turned to Chen Shanshan and spoke.
1:10:7|1:10:15|Chen Shanshan agreed to Zhang Daichen's request, and Zhang Daichen smiled, looking a bit embarrassed.
1:10:32|1:10:43|Chen Shanshan smiled and glanced at [Zhang Daichen], who seemed hesitant to speak. However, [Zhang Daichen] turned his head at that moment and focused on the concert that had just begun.
1:10:45|1:11:4|On the other side, [Jiang Feng] was standing alone in the prison, facing the transparent glass wall of the cell, bowing his head in contemplation. The sound of the door opening was heard, a prison guard walked in. [Jiang Feng] turned to look at him, as the guard closed the door and walked to the workbench to jot down something. [Jiang Feng] watched him.
1:11:4|1:11:10|With his hands hanging down, [Jiang Feng] walked to the other side of the cell, then turned around and spoke to the prison guard.
1:11:11|1:11:25|The prison guard stopped his hand movement, turned his head to look, then reluctantly put down the pen in his hand, stood up and walked towards the office with the light on the side. The guard picked up a disposable paper cup to help [Jiang Feng] get some water.
1:11:25|1:11:34|[Jiang Feng] looked at the prison guard walking into the office and then glanced thoughtfully at the half blade wrapped in plastic tape that appeared out of nowhere in his hand.
1:11:34|1:11:47|Upon hearing the footsteps of the prison guard, he quickly put down the blade in his hand. The guard opened a small window and handed him a cup of water. He took the cup and stepped back, then raised the blade in front of the guard.
1:11:47|1:12:18|The prison guard stared at him, his eyes widening in an instant, looking flustered. [Jiang Feng] looked expressionless at the panicked guard, then slowly opened his mouth, and in front of him, he put the blade into his mouth, and raised his right hand holding a paper cup to take a sip of water. The guard, completely panicked, hurried to the password lock at the door of the cell and opened it. [Jiang Feng] forcefully swallowed the blade in his mouth, then suddenly bent over and knelt on the ground. He covered his chest, blood flowing from his mouth, his face full of pain, weakly falling to the ground.
1:12:27|1:12:36|[Jiang Feng] lay in the ambulance howling in pain. He saw a pair of medical scissors on the shelf. A police officer approached the ambulance humming a tune. As soon as he opened the door, he saw Li Hang holding a doctor hostage with the scissors.
1:12:51|1:13:4|[Jiang Feng] pressed the scissors hard against the doctor's neck, forcing the police officer to surrender. The officer stood still for a few seconds, then threw his gun away and raised his hands, looking at [Jiang Feng].
1:13:10|1:13:18|The police officer nodded, took out handcuffs from behind and dangled them in front of [Jiang Feng], then handcuffed himself first, and then handcuffed himself to the doctor.
1:13:22|1:13:38|[Jiang Feng] forcefully stabbed the doctor's neck with the scissors, frightening [Doctor] greatly. [Officer Shen] voluntarily extended his left arm, and [Doctor] tremblingly picked up the syringe, inserting the needle into [Officer Shen]'s arm and pushing the medicine in.
1:13:41|1:14:4|[Jiang Feng] took out the phone from the doctor's pocket, took off his hat and ran backwards. The officer next to him tried to catch up, but the hand holding the doctor back stopped him. He took out the key to unlock the handcuffs, but the sedative had clearly taken effect, and he couldn't open the handcuffs no matter what. Frustrated, he threw away the key and gave up. In the blink of an eye, [Jiang Feng] had run far away.
1:14:4|1:14:28|While quietly enjoying the music with Chen Shanshan, [Zhang Daichen] took out her vibrating phone and glanced at it. She received a call from an unknown number. After hesitating for a few seconds, she looked around and put the phone to her ear, covering her mouth as she answered the call. It turned out to be a call from [Jiang Feng], who had just escaped to the overpass.
1:14:49|1:15:19|The phone was suddenly hung up, leaving [Zhang Daichen] feeling puzzled. Chen Shanshan, who was beside him, spoke up after hearing the commotion. [Zhang Daichen] shook his head, concealing the news from her husband. As the night grew darker, [Jiang Feng] walked unsteadily on the overpass, leaning on the railing. After a few steps, he squatted on the ground and started retching. While retching, he forcefully dug at his own throat, with saliva mixed with blood flowing from his mouth down his hand. He painfully lowered his head and finally pulled the blade out from his throat.
1:15:19|1:15:26|The scene returns to the police station office, [Officer Shen] enters and finds Officer Lei watching the surveillance footage.
1:15:43|1:15:49|Officer Lei turned to look at [Officer Shen],
1:16:4|1:16:33|Officer Shen remained silent for a while, causing Officer Lei to chuckle. There was another possible relationship between the suspect and the victim. He wrote a few words on a sticky note, tore it off, and stuck it on the glass. The note read "best friends." Officer Shen put his hands on his hips and took a few steps forward, staring at the sticky note on the glass. As he spoke, the scene suddenly shifted from a photo of Li Huilan to a black and white past.
1:16:39|1:16:58|Chen Shanshan went from Li Huilan's house to the bathroom of the woman with long hair in the blink of an eye. Then she appeared in front of Li Xiaoyun, helping her put on headphones, and then comforting Li Huilan by hugging her.
1:17:0|1:17:7|Li Huilan cried in front of Chen Shanshan, then suddenly pushed her away.
1:17:18|1:17:41|Chen Shanshan pushed Li Huilan from the second floor, then put on white disposable plastic gloves. She was standing in front of the bathtub looking at the body of the woman with long hair one second, and the next second she was in Li Huilan's house picking up a bottle of alcohol to smash towards the other person. The scene returns to reality, with [Jiang Feng] hiding in the corridor waiting for his wife to arrive.
1:17:45|1:18:3|Chen Shanshan accompanied [Zhang Daichen] down the stairs, while [Jiang Feng] hid behind a pillar watching them. He quietly took a few steps forward, hid behind another pillar, took out his phone, and dialed a number he had seen at the police station from memory. This number was the one Li Huilan had dialed before she died.
1:18:3|1:18:12|The last call, coincidentally, was from Jiang Feng.
1:18:14|1:18:25|[Jiang Feng] immediately hung up the phone upon seeing this, Chen Shanshan put her phone back in her bag, [Jiang Feng] emerged from behind the pillar.
1:18:45|1:18:49|[Jiang Feng] grabbed his wife and ran outside. Chen Shanshan felt something was wrong and took out her phone to follow.
1:19:2|1:19:16|Chen Shanshan answered the phone that had just called, only to find that [Jiang Feng]'s phone was ringing. [Jiang Feng] continued to walk forward.
1:19:37|1:19:45|[Zhang Daichen] stood in front of Chen Shanshan, pushed away [Jiang Feng], and [Jiang Feng] menacingly interrogated his wife.
1:20:35|1:20:43|[Zhang Daichen] hid behind Chen Shanshan, almost crying out of fear, while [Jiang Feng] was being restrained by several security guards on the side, his expression filled with disbelief.
1:20:55|1:21:13|Officer Lei finished speaking and turned to leave, but after a few steps, he stopped. He turned back to look at [Zhang Daichen], and after a moment of contemplation, he spoke before turning away.
1:21:15|1:21:29|[Zhang Daichen] sighed deeply, rubbed his neck, turned his head and sat down on the steps. Chen Shanshan looked at the dejected [Zhang Daichen] with a worried expression, reached out to touch the backpack on her shoulder, and then squatted down beside her to comfort her.
1:21:44|1:21:50|[Zhang Daichen] pondered for a moment, then turned his head to look at the hopeful Chen Shanshan, and refused.
1:21:54|1:22:1|[Jiang Feng] returned to the prison, sitting on a chair despondently, pondering something. [Officer Shen] opened the door and walked over to look at him.
1:22:15|1:22:23|Officer Shen nodded.
1:22:31|1:22:44|[Jiang Feng] questioned [Officer Shen] with anger, [Officer Shen] looked at him, then squatted down, rubbed his face with both hands, and looked up at [Jiang Feng].
1:22:49|1:23:7|Officer Shen remained crouched on the ground, looking at Jiang Feng. Jiang Feng raised his eyes and raised his eyebrows upon hearing Officer Shen's words, his eyes filled with complexity. After a moment of hesitation, he spoke.
1:23:8|1:23:26|[Jiang Feng] closed his eyes, a tear rolling down from his left eye. [Zhang Daichen] left the police station and returned home. She tied up her hair and stood in front of the transparent glass cabinet in the cloakroom for a few seconds, then suddenly turned around, hesitated for a moment with her back facing the cabinet where the safe was placed, her mind lost in thought.
1:23:26|1:23:33|After a moment, she seemed to have figured it out, turned around, entered the password, and opened the safe.
1:23:39|1:23:55|She opened the small iron door of the safe, inside there was a letter and a DV player. The envelope was labeled with three words for [Jiang Feng]. [Zhang Daichen] took out the letter and DV from the cabinet and started watching them alone.
1:24:22|1:24:33|[Zhang Daichen] laughed while watching the DV, reminiscing about the past, as [Jiang Feng] and his wife held hands to look at house loans.
1:25:49|1:25:53|[Zhang Daichen] sits on the bed giving herself an injection, while [Jiang Feng] stands behind her, holding her.
1:26:2|1:26:8|[Zhang Daichen] looked haggard, tears in her eyes, while [Jiang Feng] had a pained expression on his face.
1:26:14|1:26:22|Tears slid from [Zhang Daichen]'s eyes as [Jiang Feng] embraced her shoulder.
1:26:33|1:26:46|[Zhang Daichen] turned his head in surprise and stared at [Jiang Feng], who was at a loss for words. The scene switched to [Jiang Feng] sitting alone in front of the computer, writing, muttering something under his breath. [Zhang Daichen] hummed a song as she walked to the refrigerator.
1:26:51|1:27:7|[Zhang Daichen] opened the refrigerator, turned her head to look at [Jiang Feng] sitting in front of the desk lamp. She grabbed a drink and said to [Jiang Feng], "..."
1:27:21|1:27:27|[Zhang Daichen] held up the book in front of [Jiang Feng], who seemed a little upset.
1:27:41|1:27:54|[Zhang Daichen] looked at [Jiang Feng] with his head tilted, but [Jiang Feng], sitting in front of the computer, remained silent. [Zhang Daichen] opened a bottle of red wine and raised it, saying.
1:27:56|1:28:3|She lifted the wine bottle and took a big sip directly from the mouth of the bottle, then spoke intermittently.
1:28:6|1:28:24|She walked step by step to [Jiang Feng] and asked her, but [Jiang Feng] just looked at the computer in front of her, not even looking at her, still silent. After waiting for a few seconds, [Zhang Daichen] reached out and directly closed the laptop screen in front of her silent husband.
1:28:24|1:28:27|[Jiang Feng] did not stop his wife's actions.
1:28:42|1:29:7|[Zhang Daichen] had a smile on his face, but tears filled his eyes. Upon hearing his wife's question, [Jiang Feng] finally looked up at her. His expression was very complex, eyes wide open, lips moving, but not a single word came out. All that could be heard was a sigh of resignation. The scene shifted back to reality, with [Jiang Feng] sitting alone in a transparent cell, staring blankly as the lights in the prison went out.
1:29:7|1:29:13|He still maintained his original posture, pondering something, sitting in the same position all night.
1:29:14|1:29:20|After daybreak, he left the cell and entered the office of the police station. A sketch artist was drawing a portrait based on his description.
1:29:30|1:29:52|After the sketch was completed, [Jiang Feng] got into the car with Officer Lei, while Officer Shen handed a document to [Jiang Feng] outside the car. Officer Lei gave a thumbs up to Officer Shen, who then smiled at [Jiang Feng]. [Jiang Feng] returned the smile, but his expression appeared somewhat worried.
1:30:1|1:30:10|[Zhang Daichen] felt much better. However, Chen Shanshan seemed a bit hesitant.
1:31:0|1:31:8|[Zhang Daichen] looked serious, but Chen Shanshan seemed somewhat skeptical.
1:31:19|1:31:27|Chen Shanshan brought [Zhang Daichen] to the old house, where there was a large chandelier hanging from the ceiling and a lot of things piled up on the floor.
1:31:36|1:32:1|Chen Shanshan just smiled and didn't say anything. [Zhang Daichen] stood alone in the living room. She saw a group photo, in which the people were the long-haired woman that [Jiang Feng] had dreamed of, along with her mother and sister. [Zhang Daichen] followed Chen Shanshan to the back of the old house. Outside, there was a dense patch of weeds, and on the other side of the weeds was another old house.
1:32:1|1:32:14|And this house is the one that [Jiang Feng] initially dreamed of, where Li Huilan used to live. [Zhang Daichen] stood next to Chen Shanshan, oblivious, while [Jiang Feng] once again arrived at the Memory Master Surgery Center.
1:32:16|1:32:47|As he lay on the operating table just as the surgery was about to begin, the black and white memories flashed in his mind once again. He dreamed of the long-haired woman drowning in the bathtub, he dreamed of himself squatting beside the bathtub crying in pain. He looked up and saw a little boy in the mirror next to the bathtub. [Jiang Feng] in front of the mirror looked surprised, he saw the man with the severed finger intending to take away the long-haired woman, a little boy held him back, not wanting him to leave. [Jiang Feng] saw the little boy standing on a stool, tears in his eyes as he took out a bottle of medicine from the cabinet.
1:32:47|1:32:51|Seeing the long-haired woman drawing a goldfish on her hand to amuse the boy,
1:32:53|1:33:9|He saw the long-haired woman being beaten by her husband, the boy trembling in the back seat, etc. [Jiang Feng] stopped the surgery and ran out of the operating room alone, [Officer Shen] stopped him in the corridor.
1:33:24|1:33:31|The scene shifts to the old house of Chen Shanshan, [Zhang Daichen] walks into a dilapidated room, with Chen Shanshan closing the door behind her.
1:33:48|1:33:55|Chen Shanshan snatched Zhang Daichen's phone, the call was terminated, Jiang Feng was completely panicked,
1:34:3|1:34:17|Officer Lei hung up the phone and looked for Jiang Feng, only to find that he had already disappeared. Chen Shanshan and Zhang Daichen turned their heads to look outside at the same time, while Jiang Feng had already gotten into a taxi.
1:35:0|1:35:8|Xiaoyun ignored Officer Lei's questions, got off the car and ran. Officer Lei hurriedly got off the car and ran around the elderly person in front of the car door to stop Xiaoyun.
1:35:21|1:35:43|The old man held up the portrait of the long-haired woman that Officer Shen had dropped on the ground and asked, as night fell, a white car sped down the road. In the blink of an eye, Jiang Feng arrived in the village where Chen Shanshan lived by taxi. Getting out of the car, Jiang Feng rushed inside, darting through the village among the weeds. In no time, he arrived at the door of Chen Shanshan's old house.
1:35:43|1:36:5|A small house was lit up, while the adjacent big house was pitch black. [Jiang Feng] glanced at the door, then rushed into the big house. Inside, he saw [Officer Shen] sitting as if injured, with Chen Shanshan lying in the hay nearby in an unknown condition. Not finding his wife around, he immediately asked [Officer Shen].
1:36:53|1:37:6|[Jiang Feng] saw his wife lying motionless on the ground and completely lost it. He grabbed Officer Shen's gun, aimed it at Officer Shen with both hands, only to see Officer Shen writhing on the ground holding his leg.
1:37:33|1:37:43|He chambered a round in the pistol, turned and aimed at the lying Chen Shanshan. Just as [Jiang Feng] was about to pull the trigger, he suddenly realized something was wrong.
1:37:43|1:37:52|Officer Shen suddenly launched an attack on Jiang Feng, and the scene flashed back to Officer Shen sitting in the memory master surgery room undergoing surgery, revealing that the black-clothed man in the surveillance footage was him.
1:38:6|1:38:21|Officer Shen intentionally had Chen Shanshan bring Zhang Daichen to the old house, and it was still him who pushed Li Huilan down the stairs and suffocated her to death.
1:38:21|1:38:40|He crouched on the ground tightly hugging Li Huilan, one hand wearing a white plastic glove tightly covering the other's mouth and nose. Li Huilan gradually stopped all resistance from intense struggling, losing consciousness gradually as her life slipped away. Large tears streamed from Officer Shen's eyes, dripping into Li Huilan's eyes.
1:38:40|1:38:58|Li Huilan slowly closed her eyes, a tear falling down, unable to distinguish whose tear it was. The scene returned to reality, with Jiang Feng and Officer Shen wrestling on the ground. After enduring a long one-sided beating, Jiang Feng finally fought back and no longer found himself at a disadvantage.
1:38:58|1:39:7|He picked up a wooden stick with a nail on the ground and fiercely hit Officer Shen's leg. Both of them fell to the ground, with scars on their faces and their clothes in tatters.
1:39:7|1:39:19|[Officer Shen] is lying on the ground, with [Jiang Feng] on top of him, pressing a wooden stick with nails and glass shards in his hand tightly against his neck. [Officer Shen] is struggling desperately on the ground.
1:39:19|1:39:38|In the moment of life hanging by a thread, memories from childhood suddenly flashed in [Officer Shen]'s mind. He saw a little boy crying incessantly, covering his mouth while standing aside crying, then squatting by the bathtub wailing loudly, and silently sobbing with tears streaming down his face. [Officer Shen] widened his eyes, as if already immersed in the memories and giving up resistance.
1:39:38|1:39:50|[Jiang Feng] watched as [Officer Shen], who was no longer struggling and completely motionless, gradually relaxed his grip and let out a sigh of relief. The black and white images flashed through [Officer Shen]'s mind once again.
1:39:50|1:39:59|The little boy who was crying just now is now playing and frolicking in the field with the long-haired woman. They then sit in the house chatting.
1:40:7|1:40:13|The long-haired woman helps the little boy clean the wound on his hand, but the boy is not happy. The woman gives the boy a glance.
1:40:17|1:40:25|The woman with long hair held the hand of the little boy in silence for a moment, then reached out to embrace his head. Their foreheads touched as they smiled, and the woman with long hair said,
1:40:32|1:40:48|Upon hearing the boy's words, the smile on the long-haired woman's face gradually disappeared. She slowly sat up, looking at the little boy with a serious expression. The long-haired woman got up and left. The scene suddenly switched to the bathtub, where the little boy was crying and apologizing.
1:40:50|1:41:11|In the gradually overlapping memories and reality, the once lifeless Officer Shen suddenly opened his eyes wide. He silently reached out and picked up a stick, smashing it towards Jiang Feng's head. Jiang Feng was instantly knocked unconscious, the screen suddenly turned black, as if everything had fallen into silence. After a long period of darkness, a dazzling light flashed by.
1:41:11|1:41:18|Chen Shanshan was shining a flashlight directly at [Jiang Feng], while [Zhang Daichen] also walked over from the side.
1:41:20|1:41:56|[Jiang Feng] lay on the ground, with Chen Shanshan and [Zhang Daichen] squatting beside him. [Jiang Feng] struggled to sit up, then excitedly embraced his wife. The couple sat on the ground hugging tightly. Chen Shanshan looked at Officer Shen at the door, his face full of worry. [Jiang Feng], covered in blood, looked sideways at the motionless Officer Shen outside the door.
1:41:56|1:42:4|Not long after, Officer Shen suddenly turned around and prepared to come in. Jiang Feng quickly put his hand on his wife's shoulder, stood in front of her, and comforted her.
1:42:5|1:42:16|[Officer Shen] walked in from the door, holding a gun in his right hand, his clothes stained with blood and dirt. He stood in the room, looking at the three people not far away, sighed, and then spoke,
1:42:26|1:42:36|[Officer Shen] is full of unwillingness between the lines,
1:43:14|1:43:18|[Zhang Daichen] pushed her husband behind her and stood up directly in front of Officer Shen's gun.
1:43:26|1:43:33|[Zhang Daichen] did not step aside, but took another step towards the barrel.
1:43:51|1:44:17|[Zhang Daichen] said nothing, just looked at [Officer Shen] with eyes filled with tears. [Officer Shen]'s hand was shaking, and in his mind, many images suddenly appeared. He saw his manuscript being knocked away by [Zhang Daichen], with countless papers scattered everywhere. He squatted on the steps, looked up and locked eyes with [Zhang Daichen], as if love at first sight, as if timeless. He also saw [Zhang Daichen], who had been drinking, leaning on the table and questioning himself.
1:44:44|1:44:58|Officer Shen's mind was filled with Jiang Feng's memories. His hand holding the gun was trembling, tears welled up in his eyes. Suddenly, memories of himself and Li Huilan flashed through his mind.
1:45:9|1:45:17|After a gunshot, Officer Shen suddenly appeared at the door, standing there with his arm covered.
1:45:50|1:46:5|Officer Shen leaned against the wall with a look of regret and relief. He remained silent, his eyes fixed on something unknown, as if still immersed in his own world. Zhang Daichen stood by, watching him with a complex expression, as the scene gradually darkened.
1:46:5|1:46:22|The ambulance swiftly navigated on the bridge, and [Jiang Feng] lying inside slowly woke up. He looked around and saw [Zhang Daichen] already asleep by the window on his left. He tried to move but accidentally made too much noise, waking the other person up.
1:46:22|1:46:32|[Zhang Daichen] heard the movement and woke up, she quickly got up and quietly helped [Jiang Feng] up.
1:46:41|1:47:6|[Jiang Feng] struggled to sit next to [Zhang Daichen], holding her hand and looking at her affectionately. He watched as his wife, with disheveled hair and blood on her face, raised her left hand to tidy it up. Looking at his slightly disheveled wife, [Jiang Feng] apologized.
1:47:12|1:47:26|[Jiang Feng] looked apologetic, while [Zhang Daichen] gazed lovingly at her husband in front of her. They shared a deep gaze, and then she suddenly spoke to her husband.
