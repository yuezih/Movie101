0:1:57|0:2:11|In the year 2046, the robot [K-88] left a message: "God created man, man created robots. Man can doubt God, why can't robots doubt man?"
0:2:11|0:2:31|The scene suddenly shifts to a quiet village, where a prison van is driving alone on a narrow road that can only accommodate one vehicle. Inside the van sits a man wearing sunglasses, with fake eyebrows and a lazy posture. Through the reflection of the sunglasses, it is clear to see that he is facing three men in police uniforms.
0:2:41|0:2:43|Which companion's gun is aimed at [Xu Dachun].
0:3:10|0:3:23|The police in the car immediately aimed their submachine guns at [Xu Dachun] as he fell down.
0:3:39|0:3:57|The originally uninvolved citizens immediately stopped in their tracks, looking in unison at Xu Dachun driving the steamroller towards them. They instinctively stood in front of K-1, blocking it. Xu Dachun, caught off guard, could only jerk the steering wheel, allowing the steamroller to charge towards the stall. At the same time, he pulled out handcuffs, flipped onto the roof of the vehicle, and hung the handcuffs on the rope hanging above.
0:3:57|0:4:7|Sliding along the rope, [Xu Dachun] moves like a god, holding the handcuffs in his left hand and pulling out a gun in his right hand, continuously shooting at [K-1] in front. After [K-1] falls to the ground, he looks around.
0:4:36|0:4:45|The people who were originally blocking [Xu Dachun] applauded for him with smiles, and his teammates who had been watching also walked over with smiles.
0:4:45|0:5:4|Facing the questioning from [Xu Dachun], his teammates smiled without saying a word, all looking back together. Behind the layers of people stood a common luxury car, from which a curly-haired middle-aged man lowered the window, calmly lifting the corners of his mouth. Suddenly, the round-faced man pushed the curly-haired man aside, frowning as he sat by the window.
0:6:57|0:7:0|[Xu Dachun] nodded thoughtfully.
0:7:52|0:7:58|At this moment, [K-1] sauntered to the door blowing bubble gum, giving a provocative look to [Xu Dachun].
0:8:3|0:8:17|The van dropped off [K-1] and [Xu Dachun] at a remote bus stop and quickly drove away. [Xu Dachun] sat inside the factory, looking gloomy with an expression that clearly said "don't mess with me", showing that he had not yet recovered from what had just happened.
0:8:17|0:8:28|[K-1] sat next to [Xu Dachun] with a helpless look on his face. He glanced at [Xu Dachun] quietly, realizing that [Xu Dachun] didn't want to talk to him. He then lowered his head, took out a cigarette box from his pocket, and flashed a signature smile at [Xu Dachun].
0:8:49|0:8:51|[Xu Dachun] reluctantly lit a cigarette.
0:8:53|0:9:10|[K-1] saw the situation and eagerly took out a lighter to light a cigarette for [Xu Dachun], then skillfully lit one for himself. Watching [K-1]'s proficient movements, [Xu Dachun] couldn't help but widen his eyes, only to see [K-1] show off again by blowing out smoke rings in the shape of a heart.
0:9:19|0:9:25|[K-1] took another deep drag on his cigarette, then closed his eyes, pinched his nose, and smoke rings unexpectedly came out of his ears.
0:9:38|0:9:52|[Xu Dachun] lay on the hospital bed, his eyes lifeless and swollen, as if he had been punched several times. Meanwhile, at the Pingnan Town Police Station where [Xu Dachun] worked, a different scene unfolded.
0:10:41|0:10:52|[Su Mei], with a neat short hair and thick glasses, had a serious look on her face. At this moment, [Xu Dachun] returned with [K-1].
0:11:21|0:11:38|[K-1] looked at [Su Mei] with a puzzled expression. Xu Dachun stopped K-1, who wanted to shake hands with [Su Mei], and led him to the stairwell.
0:11:48|0:11:57|Facing the narrow and cluttered stairwell, [K-1] showed no signs of displeasure. He casually tossed his backpack aside and carefully picked up the newspapers on the ground, placing them into a cardboard box.
0:12:37|0:12:39|[Xiao Jiang] doesn't mind, he smiles broadly, revealing his crooked teeth.
0:13:12|0:13:20|Everyone hadn't recovered from the explosion in front of the computer, when [K-1] walked over with his index finger held high.
0:13:20|0:13:32|He completely ignored the scrutinizing gaze of [Su Mei], and paid no attention to the astonished looks of his colleagues around him. He calmly pressed a button on the computer mainframe and rotated his fingers 180 degrees, instantly restoring the computer desktop to normal.
0:13:36|0:13:43|[K-1] walked into his own stairwell, snapping his fingers, leaving behind a cool silhouette that left everyone stunned.
0:14:0|0:14:4|Dachun and [Su Mei] walk in the market, while [K-1] walks alongside on the other side.
0:14:22|0:14:38|[K-1] was seen aiming at a piece of paper with "I'm willing" written on it, showing it to [Su Mei]. [Su Mei] turned around and saw [K-1] holding up another newspaper with nonsense written on it.
0:15:4|0:15:20|After receiving a hint from [K-1], [Su Mei] couldn't help but speak up, and indeed, [Xu Dachun] had hidden the money in his shoe sole. [Xu Dachun] awkwardly squatted down, took out a bunch of banknotes that the boss found very disgusting.
0:15:38|0:15:46|[K-1] and [Su Mei] have already developed feelings for each other during this eye contact. [Xu Dachun] folds up the quilt hanging on the pole and looks back at the children carrying their school bags.
0:16:6|0:16:10|The auntie entered the room with a blanket, while [Su Mei] was tidying up in front of the mirror in the room.
0:16:26|0:16:28|Aunt Yan raised a sand pot discontentedly.
0:16:58|0:17:15|[Xu Dachun] approached [Su Mei] with soy milk and fried dough sticks, but received no response, and even got an eye roll from the inspector.
0:17:23|0:17:42|[Xu Dachun], ignoring the dissuasion, rushed up to the second floor in three or two steps. Just as he was about to break down the door, the door opened by itself. [Xu Dachun] stood there in a door-breaking posture, feeling lost. However, [K-1] seemed indifferent and even invited him in. [K-1] was leisurely sitting on a leather chair flipping through a book, while the back of the chair kept showing a charging status.
0:18:30|0:18:32|Mrs. Li lost sixteen dollars and seven cents.
0:19:34|0:19:40|[K-1] quickly solved these difficult problems, and the grateful villagers crowded the entrance of the police station to express their thanks.
0:19:49|0:20:2|Watching [K-1] moving effortlessly through the crowd, a smile appeared on [Su Mei]'s face. Upon seeing this, teacher [Xiao Jiang], who was hiding on the side, left in disappointment. That night, enthusiastic colleagues threw a celebration banquet for [K-1].
0:20:2|0:20:13|As the end approached, everyone drunkenly started arguing about who would escort [Su Mei].
0:20:18|0:20:34|Several colleagues supported each other as they left, leaving [K-1] and [Su Mei] still standing in place. The two did not speak, but tacitly moved forward at the same time. In this unusually ambiguous atmosphere, [K-1]'s eyes flashed with light, immediately activating the search function.
0:20:48|0:20:52|Su Mei was even more upset when she heard this. She pouted, looking like she was about to cry, and stood still for a while before continuing to walk forward.
0:21:30|0:21:41|Under the earnest gaze of [K-1], [Su Mei] finally compromised and closed her eyes. As [K-1] raised his finger, a glow flowed towards his fingertip, causing [Su Mei] to furrow her brows slightly in response to the light.
0:21:46|0:21:57|After the strong light flashed, [Su Mei] found everything in front of her blurred. Perplexed, she quickly took off her glasses and put them back on. After repeating this several times, the world without glasses became clearer.
0:21:57|0:22:7|In front of him, [K-1]'s face became more handsome. [K-1] did not dodge, allowing [Su Mei] to hit his cheek, and [Su Mei]'s gaze gradually changed from initial doubt to deep affection.
0:22:8|0:22:20|Suddenly, [K-1] stared closely at the corner of [Su Mei]'s mouth and took a few steps forward. Although [Su Mei] was a bit startled, she still shyly lowered her eyes, only to see [K-1] reaching out and gently pressing the corner of [Su Mei]'s mouth with deep affection.
0:22:21|0:22:36|[K-1] lightly touched the corner of [Su Mei]'s mouth and walked away without looking back. [Su Mei] put away her smile, slowly opened her eyes, but at the moment she saw [K-1]'s back, she lifted the corners of her mouth again. She hurriedly followed [K-1] through an alley, but did not find her figure.
0:22:37|0:22:49|Anxious [Su Mei] took a few more steps forward, looking around, then suddenly stopped in one direction, a smile appeared on [Su Mei]'s face again, even a tear glistened in her eyes.
0:23:4|0:23:7|[K-1] rode around [Su Mei] in circles on his bike.
0:23:9|0:23:24|[K-1] firmly held the handlebars with one hand, reaching out to [Su Mei] with the other. [Su Mei] had a happy smile on her face, immersed in this sweet and beautiful moment. She sat on the back seat of [K-1]'s bicycle, with his hands gently holding her waist, heading towards home together.
0:23:24|0:23:37|At this moment, [Su Mei] was captivated. Although it was late at night, the small noodle stall on the roadside was still bustling with people. A man was lying on the table, seemingly asleep, with four or five beer bottles next to him. At this time, [Xiao Jiang] also arrived at the noodle stall.
0:23:44|0:23:54|As [Xiao Jiang] squinted at the boss, the man sleeping next to him suddenly raised his head. The familiar face left [Xiao Jiang] feeling a bit confused.
0:25:6|0:25:12|Teacher [Xiao Jiang] and [Xu Dachun] exchanged a smile, then immediately searched for the 369 virus on the computer.
0:25:31|0:25:52|After [Xiao Jiang] pressed the enter key, the short-skirted beauty on the screen sensually swayed her body, causing the vacuum cleaner and remote-controlled car at home to restlessly move around. Under the beauty's blowing kiss, [Xu Dachun] felt as if he was floating in the clouds. The sudden knocking on the door brought [Xu Dachun] back to reality.
0:25:52|0:25:57|[Xiao Jiang] obediently pressed the exit key, and as the screen went black, all the household appliances stopped working.
0:26:2|0:26:6|[Su Qing] accidentally pressed the virus switch, and at that moment, even the chirping of the clock-telling birds sounded eerie.
0:26:30|0:26:39|[Xu Dachun] slipped and was firmly secured by the massage chair. Suddenly, a puff of smoke emerged from the computer, and the virus erupted completely.
0:27:15|0:27:22|[K-1] extended his index finger towards the computer socket again, and with a gentle twist, all the devices in the room came to a halt.
0:28:28|0:28:44|Thinking he was favored, [Xu Dachun] glared fiercely from upstairs, then went back to sleep, leaving more people destined to stay awake tonight. At this moment, [Su Mei] embraced her sorrow, sitting quietly by the window, gazing at the moonlight outside, while the table lamp inside resembled a blooming umbrella, emitting a soft and weak light.
0:28:45|0:29:0|It's as if [K-1] is in Su Mei's mind. On the way home riding a bike, Su Mei quietly puts her glasses into K-1's pocket. At this moment, K-1 takes out Su Mei's glasses, holding them up in front of his eyes. He frowns, his eyes filled with confusion.
0:29:0|0:29:16|[Su Mei] still facing the bright moonlight, took out a wooden comb from her pocket and combed her parted bangs into one piece. It seemed like she thought of something, as her bangs covered her eyes, her smile kept growing. Finally, she awkwardly tousled her bangs again, perhaps this is the beauty of a secret crush.
0:29:22|0:29:36|At this moment, [K-1] was sitting cross-legged on the toilet seat in the police station restroom, still holding Su Mei's glasses and constantly polishing them. After a long time, he sighed deeply, put the glasses back in his pocket, and unfolded a newspaper from his chest.
0:29:36|0:29:41|The newspaper instantly turned into a flat shape, with various news about robots constantly popping up.
0:29:58|0:30:4|In K-1's mind, involuntarily appeared the image of his arm around Su Mei when she was going home.
0:30:18|0:30:22|[K-1] showed a look of panic on his usually calm face for the first time.
0:30:35|0:30:43|Su Mei's smile and glance instantly captivated Xu Dachun. However, the next moment, Su Mei sat down next to K-1.
0:30:50|0:31:8|[K-1] nodded coldly and went to sit on the other side. [Su Mei] felt a sense of loss from [K-1]'s actions, and at that moment, [Xu Dachun] also looked displeased at [Su Mei].
0:31:12|0:31:17|[Su Mei] slammed the table in anger, then stood up and walked over to [Xu Dachun], giving her a fierce glare.
0:32:20|0:32:27|[Su Mei] glared angrily at [Xu Dachun], while [K-1] pretended not to hear the words, looking silently to the other side.
0:32:39|0:32:47|In the rundown factory, [Sang Biao] is on the phone, wearing a low-brimmed beret and a fierce expression. At that moment, [K-1] and [Xu Dachun] enter the factory.
0:32:58|0:33:4|At the corner, a golden retriever is tied up. Its tail immediately droops when it sees [Xu Dachun].
0:33:35|0:33:50|Upon hearing the sound, Xu Dachun immediately ran towards the rooftop, but was seen through by K-1's X-ray vision. In order to catch up with Xu Dachun as soon as possible, K-1 activated part of his robot form, with thrusters appearing on his fingertips and back, breaking through the ceiling and flying in front of Su Mei.
0:33:50|0:34:4|But [Xu Dachun] not only did not surrender, but raised the submachine gun in his hand and fired wildly at [K-1]. [K-1] countered with a slight step and charged towards [Xu Dachun], while also dodging the bullets by turning his head. Suddenly, two thrusters went out, causing him to dizzy and crash into the central tower brick wall.
0:34:14|0:34:30|At this moment, [Xu Dachun] stood with his left hand on the tip and his right hand holding a walkie-talkie, looking content. [K-1] struggled to control the thrusters to land, opened the battery box in the abdomen, only to find it out of power. Just then, the desperate San Biao ran to them in a panic.
0:34:32|0:34:51|Without waiting for [Xu Dachun] to react, Cang Biao fired the gun first, piercing through the skin on [K-1]'s face. [K-1] slowly lowered his head, then suddenly pointed forward, stopping his finger just before the needle.
0:34:51|0:34:58|[Xu Dachun] pushed [K-1] away and aggressively chased forward with a gun. However, after running a few steps, he got pricked in the butt by [K-1]'s needle.
0:35:1|0:35:17|[K-1], with extremely low power, moved abnormally slowly and fell into sleep mode again. The needle stuck in [Xu Dachun]'s buttocks immediately took effect, causing his face to turn blue and his movements to become sluggish. Sensing something amiss, [Su Qing] turned around and chased after [Xu Dachun].
0:35:17|0:35:21|[Xu Dachun] wanted to cry but had no tears, he tried his best to stop the car and then turned around to run back.
0:35:28|0:35:40|[K-1], lying on the ground, shot another arrow purely by instinct, hitting [Xu Dachun] right in the chest. [Xu Dachun] had a look like he was about to cry, and could only run forward desperately, but his speed was not much faster than a sloth.
0:35:40|0:35:46|[K-1], completely unaware of [Xu Dachun]'s situation, entered sleep mode again, leaving a panicked [Xu Dachun] to jump from the second floor.
0:35:46|0:35:59|Unexpectedly, as the slow-acting needle took effect to the extreme, [Xu Dachun] found himself falling at a much slower speed. He could only watch as [K-1], using the nearby scaffolding, effortlessly reached another level and raised his fist.
0:35:59|0:36:5|Poor [Xu Dachun] hadn't even landed yet when his chin was hit by [K-1]'s full-force uppercut, sending him slowly flying back up.
0:36:6|0:36:18|While [Xu Dachun] stood with hands on hips, staring fixedly at the police officer in front of him as he fell again, he raised the steel knife in his hand. Suddenly, [Xu Dachun] and the others moved in unison, their faces turning blue, with three acupuncture needles slowly inserted into their backs.
0:36:20|0:36:34|At this moment, the slow-acting needle effect of [Xu Dachun] gradually fades away, and his face finally returns to normal. Angrily, he raises his fist and punches [K-1] in the face. [K-1] can't even dodge, and even saliva is sprayed out by the punch.
0:36:34|0:36:40|But he refused to show weakness and immediately raised his knife to strike at [Xu Dachun]. However, at this moment, all of [Sang Biao]'s movements appeared to be in fast forward in [Xu Dachun]'s eyes.
0:36:41|0:36:54|He squatted down and [Sang Biao] couldn't find him. [Sang Biao] looked down in confusion and saw [Xu Dachun] holding several finger-length nails, nailing his own feet to the ground. Before the pained Sang Biao could even scream, he was punched to the ground by [Xu Dachun].
0:36:58|0:37:12|At this moment, Xu Dachun's men arrived late, rushing into the factory with guns in hand. Su Mei, dressed in a sharp police uniform, hurried to the front. Before Xu Dachun could even smile, he noticed that in Su Mei's eyes, there was only K-1 lying on the ground.
0:37:18|0:37:33|[Su Qing], with black hair falling in front of her face, was wringing a towel in her hand as she ran past [Su Mei]. [Su Mei] remained silent, bowing her head and rubbing the cup in her hand, looking deeply troubled. The next day, [Su Mei] arrived at [K-1]'s door with a bowl of porridge.
0:37:46|0:37:58|[K-1], with his face covered in gauze, sat silently on the stairs, staring at the door. After a long time, he slowly lowered his head and ultimately did not go to open the door. Su Mei, who had been waiting for a long time, finally ran out of patience and left with a bowl in hand.
0:41:48|0:41:59|Hearing this, [Su Mei] couldn't help but look at [K-1] in front of her. In order to avoid revealing his identity as a robot, [K-1] wrapped his head like a zongzi, only showing a pair of drooping eyes, unwilling to face everything in front of him.
0:42:0|0:42:18|[Xu Dachun] finally regained his senses, choked up as he handed the key to [Su Mei]. Seeing [Su Mei] not taking it, [Xu Dachun] stuffed the key into her hand. After saying these words, [Xu Dachun] no longer looked at [Su Mei], but walked away desolately.
0:42:18|0:42:28|[Su Mei] didn't care about [Xu Dachun]'s actions, but kept staring at [K-1], who didn't respond. He avoided [Su Mei]'s gaze and turned away from the courtyard.
0:42:35|0:42:44|In Xu Dachun's office at this moment, [Lin Xiang] personally brings someone to repair the gunshot wound on [K-1]'s face. Soon, the bandage on [K-1]'s face is removed.
0:44:7|0:44:10|The most brilliant martial arts master in the country has designed a prime minister for them meticulously.
0:44:31|0:44:35|With a kind appearance, [Xu Dachun] is very family-oriented.
0:45:28|0:45:46|Dachun, originally holding a grudge, immediately turned dark when he saw [K-1]. Despite his reluctance, Dachun and [K-1] embarked on the journey to subdue [K-88] together. Dachun sat by the window on the ferry with a desolate expression, staring blankly outside.
0:45:46|0:46:4|And behind him stood the expressionless [K-1], leaning against the railing with one hand supporting his head, looking towards the other side. The two never exchanged a word throughout. Finally, unable to contain her emotions, [Su Mei] rushed to the ferry. However, when she peered into the cabin, Dachun was still sitting there with a worried look on his face, but [K-1] was nowhere to be seen.
0:46:4|0:46:18|[Su Mei] subconsciously dodged to one side, then glanced quietly at Xu Dachun in the distance. Xu Dachun, who was bored, took out a cookie from his pocket to pass the time. Although Su Mei felt guilty towards Xu Dachun in her heart, she was unwilling to entangle further, watching as the boat was about to start.
0:46:18|0:46:31|He still looked around unwillingly, at the scenes of farewells by the ferry, some filled with laughter and some with sadness. And [Su Mei] didn't even see the person she wanted to bid farewell to. She leaned against the door in silence, and eventually left in loneliness.
0:46:31|0:46:47|At this moment, [K-1] was hiding behind a broken door panel at the stern of the ship. He only peeked out after confirming that [Su Mei] had left. He stared at her retreating figure, his eyes revealing longing and reluctance, unwilling to take his eyes off her for a long time. Perhaps even he didn't know why.
0:46:47|0:47:4|Soon, [K-1] and Xu Dachun adjusted their emotions and began their mission. That day, they found the whereabouts of [K-88] in a remote small inn. [K-1] disguised as a guest to attract the attention of the landlady, while Xu Dachun disguised himself and sneaked upstairs to meet [K-88].
0:47:39|0:47:43|Xu Dachun took out a ballpoint pen from his pocket as he spoke.
0:48:10|0:48:22|Xu Dachun, dressed in a black trench coat, with a mysterious look on his face, walked forward without waiting for [K-88] to react. However, the beads of sweat falling from his forehead betrayed his current mood.
0:48:22|0:48:32|Under Xu Dachun's persuasion, [K-88] got into Xu Dachun's car and arrived at the deserted mountain road. Suddenly, the car stopped.
0:48:39|0:48:45|Xu Dachun calmly took out the Lin Xiaona microphone from his hat, pressed the button, but only music came out.
0:49:21|0:49:32|Suddenly, a clap of thunder sounded, and [K-88] looked tightly out the window. Dachun took the opportunity to press the I lever, but only music was heard. [K-88]'s eyes turned red, clearly seeing [K-1] rushing towards them.
0:49:38|0:49:45|At this moment, Dachun shoulders the individual rocket launcher and aims at [K-88].
0:49:48|0:50:1|[K-88] not only did not dodge, but also opened its lower jaw, transforming into a mechanical form, directly swallowing the shell into its mouth. The next second, an explosion wave sprayed out from its mouth, turning the car into charcoal in an instant, even knocking [Xu Dachun] out far away.
0:50:1|0:50:6|[Xu Dachun] was still searching for people everywhere, while [K-1] and [K-88] had already fought 800 rounds.
0:50:7|0:50:16|[K-1] threw away [Xu Dachun], who was still puzzled, and single-handedly blocked [K-88]'s fireball. He was instantly overturned by the huge impact force and crashed into the hard stone wall.
0:50:16|0:50:25|Even so, [K-1] once again flew towards them, smashing and knocking down the rocks, blocking the fatal blow for [Xu Dachun], while [K-88] walked over unscathed at this moment.
0:50:27|0:50:39|[K-1] immediately rushed in front of the big car and transformed into a vehicle form. Seeing this, [K-88] calmly turned into a green sports car and sped away.
0:50:46|0:50:58|Upon seeing the off-road vehicle chasing from behind, [Xu Dachun] immediately started spinning the steering wheel frantically. Meanwhile, [K-1] also began to transform, widening its wheel hubs and turning into a motorcycle, with a thruster added to the rear of the vehicle.
0:50:58|0:51:15|But even so, [Xu Dachun] couldn't shake off [K-88] behind him. The throttle of the off-road vehicle was pushed to the maximum, and the speed instantly soared to 200 kilometers per hour. In this way, the two cars flashed past like sharp blades, leaving only a trail on the road. The human body could not withstand this speed for a while, and [Xu Dachun] could only grit his teeth.
0:51:26|0:51:29|In the next second, [K-88] sets up a cannon on the roof of the car.
0:51:30|0:51:38|Compared to K-88's weapon, the rocket launcher in Xu Dachun's hands seemed like a toy. He turned around in panic, letting K-1 take him flying.
0:51:38|0:51:54|Quickly, [K-88] completed the filling, and a super large shell shot straight towards them. With [K-1]'s extreme turn, the shell passed by, blasting a big hole in front of them. Unable to land perfectly, [K-1] leaped up, flipped in the air, and transformed into a white robot.
0:52:1|0:52:19|[K-88] couldn't hold back any longer. He spread the electric current all over the ground and struck down with his palm. This move had great force, causing the ground to crack open with rocks and sand flying towards [K-1], who managed to dodge the attack with a few backflips.
0:52:20|0:52:36|With the help of the thrusters, [Xu Dachun] floated in mid-air and made a provocative gesture towards [K-88]. [K-88], strong and powerful, pushed off the ground and leaped into the air, while [K-1] took the opportunity to kick towards him. And so, the two generations of super robots engaged in a showdown in their strongest forms for the first time.
0:52:36|0:52:55|[K-1] delivered a swift kick to [K-88]'s chest, and the rapidly spinning gears seemed to act like a cutting machine, instantly tearing open a gash in front of him. Just as [K-88] barely dodged a spinning kick from [K-1], he was once again struck by a punch to the cheek, the powerful blow sending him crashing towards the ground, only managing to hang in mid-air with the help of thrusters.
0:52:55|0:53:13|After finally stabilizing his posture, [K-88] looked up again, with a burst of divine light in his eyes. However, [K-1]'s abilities were not limited to this. Two metal rods flew out from his scapula, transforming into nunchucks under the connection of lightning. Unwilling to show weakness, [K-88] picked up a huge rock and threw it towards [K-1].
0:53:13|0:53:25|However, [K-1] simply waved his double sticks lightly, and the huge rock instantly turned into pieces. Then, [K-1] swiftly charged towards [K-88], using a mesmerizing set of double stick techniques to shatter various blue and green boulders into pieces.
0:53:25|0:53:40|However, the last huge rock was split open by [Blue Demon], with [K-88] behind wielding dual blades full of killing intent. At this point, the battle had escalated to a white-hot intensity, with the weapons of both sides bursting with sparks and residual energy crisscrossing in the air, making it difficult to determine the outcome.
0:53:40|0:53:52|[K-88] took the lead, swinging a sword towards [K-1]. [K-1] dodged the blade by leaning to the side, while also throwing out the nunchaku in hand. [K-88] immediately used the double knives to block in front of his chest. However, he still couldn't dissipate the force.
0:53:52|0:54:11|Backing up a lot, [K-88] once again flew forward, but the blade he swung down was easily blocked by the nunchucks. Seeing that close combat was not working, [K-88] turned his dual blades towards [K-1]. However, not only did [K-1] easily dodge them, he also knocked the blades away. After retrieving his blades, [K-88] looked solemn and finally unleashed his ultimate skill.
0:54:11|0:54:15|The fierce flames instantly spread across the dual blades, overwhelming even [K-1].
0:54:16|0:54:29|As [K-88] soared into the air, the raging flames turned into sharp blades and headed straight for [K-1]. [K-1] intended to counterattack with both hands, but his weapon was split in half directly, and he himself was cut in half by the flames.
0:54:29|0:54:36|[K-1] lost combat effectiveness in an instant, gently falling down. When [Xu Dachun] looked up again, he saw that [K-1] had already returned to human form.
0:54:37|0:54:53|Lying in a sorry state on the side, [K-88] retracted his moves and transformed back into human form, landing slowly on the ground. Without saying a word, [Xu Dachun] once again pulled out the [I-bar]. The familiar music played again, and [Xu Dachun] looked at [K-88] with a look full of sorrow and heroism.
0:54:59|0:55:5|After being stomped on fiercely, I-Gong emitted a piercing bell sound, which piqued [Xu Dachun]'s curiosity as he picked it up to examine.
0:55:5|0:55:22|At the moment when he controlled I-Gong with his hand, he suddenly transformed into a mechanical cannon attached to [Xu Dachun]'s shoulder. [K-88] looked wary, alertly took a step back, and [Xu Dachun] immediately exerted force, arrogantly aiming the cannon at [K-88], but after pulling the trigger several times, the cannon remained motionless.
0:55:49|0:56:9|[Xu Dachun] didn't hesitate, turned around and ran, while [K-1] reached out and lay in front of [K-88]. Clearly proficient in martial arts, [K-88] kicked [K-1] in the leg, then lifted him with one hand and threw him heavily to the side.
0:56:9|0:56:14|[K-88] raised [K-1] with one hand, then mercilessly pulled out the battery box from his body and threw it away.
0:56:48|0:57:9|[K-88] grabbed [K-1]'s collar, desperately seeking answers, but in the end only received a confused and weak gaze.
0:57:19|0:57:30|At this moment, [K-1] was completely defenseless, allowing [K-88] to charge at him again and crash into a pile of rubble. As [K-88] rushed over to deliver a fatal blow, he found [Xu Dachun], who had originally escaped, standing in front of him.
0:57:33|0:57:48|[Xu Dachun] is no longer afraid of [K-88], he raises the battery box in his hand and reinserts it into the abdomen of [K-1]. The restored [K-1] seems to awaken from a dream, gasping for breath as he sits up. Just as he gratefully looks at [Xu Dachun], a sharp blade emerges from [Xu Dachun]'s back.
0:57:48|0:57:58|Dachun looked down in disbelief at his chest, watching as [K-88] pulled out a long knife. Suddenly, the mechanical cannon on his right arm activated, and Dachun immediately turned and bit into [K-88].
0:58:3|0:58:9|The cannon fired a beam of light, spreading between the two, and [K-88] didn't even have a chance to react.
0:58:9|0:58:24|After the intense light, metal parts scattered everywhere. [K-1]'s hair stood up straight from the explosion, lying unconscious on the ground. Not far from him, [K-88] had turned into a pile of scattered pieces, with the simulated skin on his thigh blown open, revealing two metal bones.
0:58:24|0:58:30|[K-1] suddenly opened his eyes sharply, twitched a few times as he looked at the scene in front of him, then struggled to move backwards.
0:59:5|0:59:25|Dachun lay weakly in the arms of [K-1], looking at him with an incredibly gentle smile. Suddenly, Dachun's expression stiffened, his head fell weakly, and blood from the corner of his mouth had already soaked through his chest. [K-1] held him, staring blankly at the ground.
0:59:27|0:59:49|He roared in despair, his gaze suddenly fixed on a certain spot. When he looked back at Xu Dachun, his eyes revealed determination and madness. At this moment, the scene shifted to the Tian'an Research Center, which was gloomy and dim, with only some numb staff walking back and forth. Lin Xiang poured out a twisted iron wire from the test tube, his face full of astonishment.
0:59:54|1:0:22|At night, a lively banquet was held in Pingnan Town. [Su Mei] nodded thoughtfully, sighed after a while, and Teacher [Xiao Jiang] behind her would occasionally glance back at her.
1:0:29|1:0:34|[Xu Dachun] gave Song Mei a warm hug, then kindly held his hand, full of concern.
1:1:12|1:1:38|[Su Qing] analyzed everything expressionlessly and then drifted away like a ghost. [Xiao Jiang] sat by the riverbank in frustration, wrote "Xiao Jiang loves Su Mei" on a wooden board, and then wiped it off in despair.
1:1:52|1:2:0|It is generally believed that a third party will only destroy others' happiness. The so-called free love.
1:2:33|1:2:54|Xiao Jiang rushed towards Su Qing and grabbed his arm. Su Qing looked at Xiao Jiang with a strange affection in his eyes. However, Xiao Jiang, oblivious to this, spat out the cigarette in his mouth, widened his eyes, and stared straight into Su Qing's eyes.
1:3:37|1:3:44|Without waiting for [Xiao Jiang] to react, [Su Qing] twisted his shoulder and attached her lips to his, leaving [Xiao Jiang] dumbfounded on the spot.
1:4:16|1:4:27|After receiving a satisfactory answer, she smiled contentedly and walked away. It took a while for Teacher [Xiao Jiang] to react, and she watched [Su Qing] walking away, feeling reluctant for the first time.
1:6:6|1:6:16|While [K-1] was dealing with Song Mei outside, [Su Qing] sneaked into Xu Dachun's room. Xu Dachun was sitting on a stool with his head tilted at that moment, which made Su Qing couldn't help but take a few steps closer.
1:6:17|1:6:23|At the moment when [Su Qing] turned her head, [Xu Dachun]'s head popped out two meters high directly from his neck.
1:6:44|1:6:58|[Su Mei] opened the door and saw Teacher [Xiao Jiang] outside. He grinned widely, showing a mouthful of broken teeth, his eyes almost bulging out. Upon seeing that it was [Su Mei], Teacher [Xiao Jiang] pushed aside his long hair, cupped her face, and kissed her.
1:7:4|1:7:14|[K-88] excitedly rolled his eyes and gestured for [Xiao Jiang] to enter the room, then shyly went upstairs.
1:7:21|1:7:34|Previously, [Su Qing] excitedly pushed open the door of [Xu Dachun]'s room, only to find him missing. At this moment, [Xu Dachun] was hiding in the kitchen activating the mimicry program. He picked up a pair of pliers and examined them, and the next second, his head turned into pliers.
1:7:34|1:7:44|Later, he picked up a can of preserved fish, and as Teacher [Xiao Jiang] walked into the kitchen with light steps, what she saw was a huge can resting on [Xu Dachun]'s neck.
1:7:51|1:8:14|The mastermind [Xu Dachun] sat on the balcony flipping through a book as if nothing had happened. After [Su Qing] left, the weak [Xiao Jiang] teacher looked towards the balcony, and at that moment, [Xu Dachun] was scanning the baby's bottom in the magazine. The balcony door opened, revealing a figure.
1:8:17|1:8:21|When [Su Qing] rushed into the room, Teacher [Xiao Jiang] fainted again.
1:8:29|1:8:33|[Xiao Jiang] frowned, covered his head that was hit, and struggled to sit up.
1:8:46|1:9:8|With a cough, Xu Dachun's eyeball unexpectedly popped out. Xu Dachun calmly pushed the eyeball back into its socket, then scanned the green plants in front of him again, turning his head into a few leaves.
1:9:12|1:9:20|[K-1] lowered his gaze, a look of panic flashed across his usually expressionless face, even his pupils uncontrollably contracted.
1:9:49|1:10:0|[K-1] twitched at the corner of his mouth, speaking with great difficulty. Assuming that [Su Mei] received a satisfactory answer, her face was filled with the shy look of a little girl.
1:10:13|1:10:17|[K-1] showed an awkward smile, with wisps of smoke coming out from behind his head.
1:10:23|1:10:28|[K-1] conceals a few cigarettes, the cigarette butt sparks as the wind blows, and even his backside catches fire.
1:10:39|1:10:42|[K-1] roared in agony, and his physical malfunction disappeared instantly.
1:10:58|1:11:8|[Su Mei] forced a smile as she messed up her hair into a mess, then she walked away swaying her arms. [K-1] clenched his fists in frustration, looking helplessly and with a tinge of heartache at [Su Mei]'s retreating figure.
1:11:8|1:11:18|At night, [Xu Dachun] curled up in his small bed sleeping soundly, while [K-1], bathed in moonlight, sat slouched in the charging chair, looking disheveled.
1:11:48|1:12:1|The scene of that night is still vivid, but [Xu Dachun] will never come back again. [K-1] walks alone through the streets and alleys once walked with [Xu Dachun], where the doors are tightly closed, no longer bustling as before.
1:12:12|1:12:23|Song lifted his tattooed eyebrows and saw the message sent by [K-1] on the screen. [K-1] sincerely expressed that if what he said yesterday had upset Song, he wanted to apologize.
1:12:23|1:12:32|Song Mei pursed her lips, dropped the newspaper in her hand, and started typing on the keyboard clatteringly, telling [K-1] that he was overthinking it, and she was not actually angry.
1:12:34|1:12:41|[Su Mei] stared at the screen for several seconds, pretending to be indifferent, and replied stubbornly.
1:12:44|1:12:51|And the next sentence from [K-1] instantly stumped [Su Mei], even her hands resting on the keyboard were pulled back, only to see the screen questioning back.
1:12:53|1:13:6|[Su Mei] stared at the screen for a long time, not knowing how to reply. Her hands were nervously folded together as she sat on the stairs next to [K-1], completely ignoring the noisy surroundings. [K-1] was focused on the computer screen, waiting earnestly for a response from [Su Mei], but it never came.
1:13:6|1:13:11|In the end, as a robot, [K-1] couldn't control his inner feelings for the first time, word by word.
1:13:59|1:14:15|As a robot, K-1 didn't have any fancy decorations, but it was this sincere language that was most precious. [Su Mei] stared at the screen, her eyes gradually turning red, tears shimmering. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, calmed herself, and asked the last soul-piercing question.
1:14:16|1:14:25|K-1 stared at the screen in front of him without moving, like a statue. Only the slightly dilated pupils silently interpreted the struggle in his heart at this moment.
1:14:29|1:14:42|The colleagues around did not sense the undercurrent between the two, and even teased each other. When [Lin Xiang] appeared, [K-1]'s face immediately darkened.
1:16:0|1:16:19|[Lin Xiang] turned around and saw [Xu Dachun]'s head bouncing off his neck, which scared him unconscious. Two men in black rushed into the office upon hearing the noise. The men in black nodded, dropped [Lin Xiang], and ran away. [Su Mei] didn't notice and quickly made a phone call.
1:16:58|1:17:9|The workers at Ma Tou are currently being chased by thugs, while the two black-clad men brought by [Lin Xiang] are calmly surrounding from both sides. [Xu Dachun] reaches out to block [K-1] and takes a few steps forward.
1:17:15|1:17:28|Obviously, the man in black was not pleased, throwing a shoe at [Xu Dachun]'s face, then turning towards [K-1]. As the man on the left reached out, a powerful force of air came towards [K-1], causing him to uncontrollably fly in his direction.
1:17:28|1:17:34|[K-1], unable to break free with one hand, raised his right fist to prepare for an attack, but at this moment, the black-clothed person on his right also made a move.
1:17:35|1:17:42|[K-1] sucked in his right fist, caught between two air currents, he floated in the middle of the hall with his mouth wide open, unable to break free.
1:17:42|1:17:57|The men in black gathered and attacked in unison, one hand grabbing [K-1]'s arm while the other palm struck his temple, erasing all memories related to [Lin Xiang] and Tian'an from [K-1]'s mind in an instant. Even [Xu Dachun]'s memories were fading quickly.
1:17:57|1:18:7|While erasing the memories related to [Su Mei], [K-1] became furious. He struggled desperately and, with his own strength, managed to stop the operation of the brain deletion system, leaving the men in black astonished.
1:18:7|1:18:15|But despite [K-1]'s struggles, he still couldn't break free from the black-clothed men's restraints, and could only forcibly preserve all memories related to [Su Mei].
1:18:15|1:18:33|The man in black, seeing the situation, immediately increased the power output. [Xu Dachun] couldn't hold back anymore, raised his fist and rushed forward. Before he could get close, he was punched by the man in black and sent flying into the air. As he fell to the ground, his body was surrounded by flashing electricity and accompanied by terrifying black smoke, directly knocking three people away.
1:18:33|1:18:45|[K-1] was stunned, as the figure in front of him was no longer that of [Xu Dachun], but the long-discarded [K-88]. He still wore that arrogant smile, smoothly demonstrating a set of boxing techniques, provocatively extending his white hand towards the black-clothed man.
1:18:54|1:18:59|The two men in black still had expressionless faces, obviously not taking [K-88] seriously.
1:18:59|1:19:11|However, at the moment when the man in black reached out, [K-88] held his hand in the air, pulling and pushing without touching the body of the man in black, but directly sending him flying, with [K-88]'s hands wrapped in a black mist.
1:19:12|1:19:28|As long as the black-clothed man is hit, sparks will burst out, and no matter how the black-clothed man strikes, it will be blocked by the black mist. Then, [K-88] leaped up in the wind, splitting the black-clothed man in front with a palm, then turned around, bent over and retreated to avoid another person's fist, and took the opportunity to give him a palm as well.
1:19:28|1:19:38|The man in black, unwilling to show weakness, raised his right palm again and used the Shadow Hand technique. Despite facing off with him, [K-88] remained calm and composed, while another man in black immediately raised his palm and attacked from behind in perfect coordination.
1:19:39|1:20:2|[K-88] made a Tai Chi move, sending both of them flying with his power. Seeing [K-88] transform back into [Xu Dachun], [K-1] grabbed him and ran forward, with two men in black following closely behind. Soon, they arrived at a dilapidated cabin.
1:20:12|1:20:27|After a loud noise, [K-1] alertly raised his head, only to see the ship compartment, which had been dismantled into several sections, miraculously merging back together. The compartment instantly plunged into darkness, with the only exit behind them forcefully sealed shut, completely forming an enclosed space.
1:20:27|1:20:40|The football field-sized cabin is filled with old metal parts, and at this moment, it is unexpectedly restless, trembling. To the horror of [Xu Dachun], screws of all sizes in the cabin are twisting and falling off on their own, being sucked into the air by a huge force.
1:20:41|1:20:56|Soon, the steel pipes made by the wrist, the iron sheets of the abdomen, and even the iron hooks and anchor without the cargo curtain were all being dragged on the ground, struggling to fly upwards. As the metal structures of [K-1] and [Xu Dachun], stood in place, [Xu Dachun]'s phone was also sucked away.
1:20:56|1:21:1|[Xu Dachun] hurriedly ran a few steps forward, trying to retrieve his phone, but almost got sucked in himself.
1:21:2|1:21:13|[K-1] tightly grabbed [Xu Dachun]'s arm, then skillfully dodged the huge crane flying from behind. In the blink of an eye, all the metal components inside the cabin were sucked in and spun around in the massive storm.
1:21:13|1:21:31|They pieced it together on their own, and soon assembled a giant robot almost as tall as the cabin. The crane that was sucked in transformed into the top cockpit, equipped with complete brakes and throttle. The feet of the black-clothed man rested on top, the twin barrels of the arms resembling clear skies, with an attacking power capable of destroying everything in its path.
1:21:32|1:21:43|The robot turned to face the two, with [K-1] and [Xu Dachun] in front of them like two ignorant ants. The acrobat controlled his body's movements, roaring a challenge at the two.
1:21:54|1:22:4|[K-88] didn't pay much attention to these words. After watching [K-1] leave, he looked up at the imposing figure in front of him, feeling the provocation in the other's eyes even through the glass window.
1:22:4|1:22:16|[K-1] had just stepped aside, preparing to launch an attack, when he saw that [K-88] had already drawn a long knife in his hand. He swung it wildly, and soon a vortex wrapped in flames appeared. Even the men in black couldn't help but dodge into their bodies.
1:22:16|1:22:23|Finally, [K-88] and his long knife merged into one, turning into a huge fireball, smashing the robot's arm into pieces.
1:22:25|1:22:40|The man in black chuckled, pressed the button in front of him, and the scattered parts miraculously reassembled. He even clapped his hands together as if swatting a mosquito, swatting [K-88] to death. Seeing the situation, [K-1] rushed up to provide support, but unexpectedly, he was slapped away by the robot.
1:22:40|1:22:57|At this moment, [K-88] has ascended to the robot in front of him, raising his long knife, ready to perform his ultimate move. Unexpectedly, the man in black took advantage of the opportunity to manipulate the mechanical arm, grabbing the long knife and extending numerous tentacles onto the blade, activating a powerful electric current. [K-88] was momentarily unable to break free, his face wiped clean by the electricity.
1:22:57|1:23:10|And when [K-1] saw this scene, he suddenly came up with a great idea. At this moment, [K-88] had already broken free from the electric shock and was being chased by the robot, while [K-1] opened the electronic screen.
1:23:24|1:23:39|[K-1] ignores [K-88] and focuses on searching for the virus, while [K-88] continues to bear the burden of distracting the robots. The robot wraps [K-88] in a light ball, rolls it in its hands a few times, and then sends it flying, coincidentally knocking down [K-1] who is searching for the virus once again.
1:23:40|1:23:43|[K-1] looked at the screen in astonishment, only to see the virus named "Brotherhood Loyalty 7314" successfully sent.
1:24:4|1:24:17|Suddenly, behind [K-88], a dozen martial arts disciples appeared. However, their good fortune didn't last long as all of them were subdued with just one move.
1:24:23|1:24:29|Seeing [K-88] continuously summoning people holding weapons, [K-1] standing on the side was dumbfounded.
1:24:29|1:24:41|Before long, the people summoned by [K-88] occupied half of the cabin space. Everyone raised their weapons and charged forward without fear, while the men in black continued to smirk relentlessly, even leisurely lighting a cigarette.
1:24:41|1:24:59|But when everyone aggressively surrounded the robot, the man in black calmly gripped the handle of the scope. He controlled the robot and aimed the barrel of the gun at the densest part of the crowd. [K-1] looked at the dazzling light flashing on the barrel, couldn't help but be surprised, while the group of people still rushed forward without hesitation.
1:24:59|1:25:12|Shortly after, [K-1] kept pressing the switch continuously, and the bullets seemed to be firing wildly. The shape of these bullets was very unique, like iron palms. Once they hit a human, they would turn into a sealed rectangular cage.
1:25:12|1:25:27|In the blink of an eye, the people summoned by [K-88] have been killed or injured, leaving only him jumping around in anger, dodging attacks. [K-1] frantically manipulated the joystick, almost in a frenzy, but even after firing bullets, he couldn't capture [K-88].
1:25:27|1:25:34|While the robot was activating its new weapon, [K-88] attempted to summon again, this time a row of hackers dressed in black with sunglasses.
1:25:44|1:25:54|[K-88] desperately called out, summoning a row of young girls in fur coats, wielding machetes. Watching these fearless individuals, [K-88] raised his arm again.
1:26:2|1:26:17|[K-1] had just finished speaking when [K-88]'s eyes started rolling uncontrollably, and smoke came out of his mouth. At this moment, the robot had already controlled all the people summoned by [K-88] in the cage, aimed at him, and began reloading bullets after helping him up.
1:26:17|1:26:24|[K-1] is powerless in the face of this sudden thick fog, only able to flee in embarrassment, while the robot, fully loaded with bullets, roars as it scans the area below.
1:26:25|1:26:36|At this moment, with no one in the mirror, the man in black revealed his madness when he saw [K-88] constantly agitated by electric currents all over his body. He smirked and pressed another button.
1:26:36|1:26:45|But at this moment, the robot showed no response at all. Instead, thick smoke billowed from the control panel, causing the black-clothed man's expression to freeze instantly. He stood up in disbelief and looked down.
1:26:46|1:27:4|The saw slowly cuts open a slit in the rectangular cage, sparks flying out sharply. Another figure in black can't sit still either, leaning over to look below, only to see a flash of light in the center of the cage, the door opening, and the hackers emerging. Various people summoned by [K-88] quickly pry open the cages that had imprisoned them.
1:27:5|1:27:22|They stood neatly in front of the men in black, simultaneously shooting grappling hooks at him, firmly locking him in place. The man in black, feeling embarrassed, immediately sat down to control the robot, trying to break free from the restraints. However, two fists are no match for four hands, the man in black even pulled off the steering wheel, but it didn't change anything.
1:27:22|1:27:34|The dashboard kept flashing warnings, and at the same time, the robot's head wires were all torn off due to excessive twisting. In the end, [K-88] couldn't hold on any longer and took the hit first.
1:27:35|1:27:48|At the same moment, the powerful body of the robot also collapsed on the ground. [K-1] cautiously peeked out from the corner to observe the situation of [Xu Dachun]. Only to see the people summoned by [K-88] climbing menacingly into the cockpit of the robot.
1:27:52|1:28:0|Afterwards, he wielded his weapon again and delivered a series of blows to the robot's body.
1:28:0|1:28:16|At this moment, [K-88] was in a very bad condition, lying weakly on the ground, his body twitching continuously. The Jianghu loyalty 7314 he received also stopped operating, as a soft light flashed across the cabin, and the people who were still dismantling the robots disappeared in an instant without a trace.
1:28:16|1:28:18|[K-1] hurriedly embraced [K-88] in his arms,
1:28:26|1:28:32|[K-88] eyes shimmered with tears as he looked at [K-1].
1:28:44|1:28:59|[K-88] hopes to get a satisfactory answer. He looks at [K-1] with a rare gaze, but in the end, he doesn't get what he's waiting for. [K-1] can't hide his painful expression, trembling as he embraces [K-88] in his arms, showing a hint of reluctance.
1:28:59|1:29:6|After finally managing to digest his emotions, [K-1] let go of [K-88], only to see [K-88]'s face transform back into [Xu Dachun].
1:29:20|1:29:27|At this moment, a police car drifts stylishly around the bend, heading towards the dock. [K-1] is also seen bringing [Xu Dachun] out of the cabin.
1:29:28|1:29:36|Seeing the radiant smile of [Su Mei], [K-1] couldn't calm his heart. Soon, as night fell, everyone gathered at the workshop again.
1:30:1|1:30:8|[Su Qing] impatiently points at Teacher [Xiao Jiang], who obediently squats aside, while [Xu Dachun] looks at the approaching [Su Mei] and guiltily turns his head away.
1:31:37|1:31:50|[Su Mei] looked at the scene in front of her in disbelief, took a few steps back, and finally bumped into [K-1]'s chest. Instead of dodging, [K-1] gently grabbed [Su Mei]'s shoulder. [Su Mei] seemed determined as she turned to look at [K-1].
1:31:50|1:31:56|However, at the moment he saw the expression on [K-1]'s face, he understood everything. He realized that [K-1] was indeed a robot.
1:31:58|1:32:15|[K-1] is about to make a decision. Looking at the tearful [Su Mei], he feels reluctant in his heart, but he only gives her a glance before walking away without hesitation. From this moment on, he is no longer just a cold machine, but transforms into a responsible and thoughtful person.
1:32:15|1:32:18|Soon, [K-1] arrived outside the factory to confront his ultimate enemy.
1:32:19|1:32:34|[Lin Xiang] walked solemnly in a black coat, with eight black-clad men on either side of him. Behind him, there was a monstrous creature resembling a tank, towering as tall as a bow. He exuded the aura of a sage, his cold eyes filled with killing intent.
1:32:38|1:32:52|Seeing [K-1] charging towards him, [Lin Xiang] was initially very disdainful, but when he saw him transform into a robot, [Lin Xiang] finally took it seriously. [K-1] hovered in the air, struck a fighting pose towards the steel monster, but couldn't help but glance down.
1:32:52|1:33:3|At this moment, [Su Mei] looked up into the air with a shocked expression mixed with a hint of worry. The steel monster suddenly began to transform, lifting its top and extending two powerful mechanical legs from its middle.
1:33:4|1:33:16|At the same time, covered all over with small gun barrels, with two missile launchers extending from the top of the barrels on the arms, and two rows of rocket launchers on the chest, all gun barrels are neatly aimed at [K-1].
1:33:16|1:33:27|However, the ultimate weapon of the high-speed rail monster is still behind it. There is a huge platform on its back, covered with densely packed rockets, totaling over a hundred. This power is enough to make [K-1] disappear in smoke and ashes.
1:33:34|1:33:53|[Xu Dachun] looked up and comforted the party, [K-1] glanced at [Xu Dachun], then turned to look at [Su Mei]. At this moment, [Su Mei]'s emotions had calmed down, she looked at him quietly, [K-1] retracted the robot form and transformed back into a human.
1:33:53|1:34:0|Everyone turned around to see Teacher [Xiao Jiang] wearing a helmet, a flashing light on his chest, and holding two tasers in his hands.
1:34:14|1:34:23|[Xiao Jiang] opened the mini calculator on his arm, sending a current of electricity back and forth on the drill bit, stunning it.
1:34:54|1:35:3|[K-1] seemed to have his heart ripped out, his knees went weak and he fell to the ground. Witnessing this scene, [Su Mei]'s strong heart instantly collapsed, and she ran towards [K-1].
1:35:3|1:35:13|Xu Dachun stood calmly in front of the men in black, apparently having made a decision, while Lin Xiang slowly approached K-1 and looked down at him from a higher vantage point.
1:35:18|1:35:27|[K-1], with a distracted look, raised his head and gazed at [Lin Xiang] with eyes full of despair. A hint of tears shimmered in his eyes as he softly conceded.
1:35:31|1:35:45|Watching the once proud high technology being used in such a humble way for humanity, [Xu Dachun]'s cold eyes showed a hint of dissatisfaction, but in the end he turned his head, as if tacitly agreeing. [K-1] lowered his head, silently stood up, and took the lead in walking towards [Xu Dachun].
1:35:45|1:35:51|Although men are not supposed to shed tears easily, when [K-1] stood in front of [Xu Dachun], tears were already welling up in his eyes.
1:36:30|1:36:44|[Xu Dachun] didn't mind and continued to look earnestly at [K-1]. Touched by this belated understanding, [K-1] lowered his head and cried like a child. From a distance, [Lin Xiang] turned his head, casting a cold glance at the crying [K-1].
1:36:44|1:36:52|As a human and the creator of [K-1], [Lin Xiang] simply cannot understand why the robot he personally trained has turned into what it is now.
1:36:52|1:37:5|After a long time, [K-1] finally calmed down. He nodded at [Xu Dachun] and then turned to walk away, each step he took was firm and slow. It seemed like he was experiencing the true touch of this land.
1:37:9|1:37:25|Under the gaze of everyone, [K-1] slowly stopped in front of [Su Mei]. [Su Mei] looked at her beloved, her eyes shining, while the slightly furrowed brows silently expressed his heartache. The two of them just stood there quietly, looking at each other, neither speaking first.
1:37:25|1:37:29|Finally, all the attachments of [K-1] turned into tears overflowing from the eyes, barely curling up the corners of the mouth.
1:37:54|1:38:10|Su Mei's tears welled up in her eyes as she stared at K-1, her pursed lips seemingly holding endless grievances. K-1 lowered his head in silence, clasped his hands together, and presented a bunch of vibrant roses. These roses seemed to have a life of their own, continuously growing in K-1's hands, almost overflowing.
1:38:10|1:38:26|She looked at the roses in her hand, showing the most sincere smile, and held out her hands to [Su Mei]. [Su Mei] smiled through tears and also reached out her hands, letting [K-1] put all the roses into her palm. From this moment on, their hearts were tightly close together.
1:38:26|1:38:44|Su Mei finally understood the feelings of [K-1], who no longer needed to worry about going against his principles to do something against his heart. With deep affection, [K-1] looked at the girl in front of him and whispered a sentence in her ear. Tears streamed down Su Mei's face in an instant, but she also smiled with joy. It was a long-lost "I love you."
1:38:44|1:38:50|However, after the heartfelt confession, [K-1] made the final and most cruel decision to end his own life.
1:38:53|1:39:11|Every time [Su Mei] snapped out of her joy, she gradually turned [K-1]'s body into diamond-like particles. The roses in [Su Mei]'s hand fell to the ground, and she collapsed to her knees, trying to gather the fragments back together. However, the fragments turned into twinkling stars in the air and disappeared.
1:39:26|1:39:44|Buried deep in [Xu Dachun]'s heart, memories suddenly surged, bringing tears to her eyes. Meanwhile, [Su Mei] knelt on the ground, looking around in a daze, trying to find the figure of [K-1]. However, besides the roses scattered all over the ground, there was nothing left.
1:39:44|1:39:59|In the end, [Su Mei] wept in despair under everyone's gaze until she fainted. [Xu Dachun] voluntarily followed [Lin Xiang] back to the research institute to contribute to the development of new technology combining humans and robots, aiming to create a super robot to serve society.
