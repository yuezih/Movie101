0:3:40|0:3:44|On the other side, the female lead [Sha Lu] is wearing a pair of exquisite high heels.
0:3:57|0:4:2|The lawyer placed the agreement in front of [Sha Lu], who lowered his head to look at it.
0:4:21|0:4:30|The lawyer handed the pen on the table to [Sha Lu], who took it and signed his name, then the lawyer quickly put away the agreement.
0:4:38|0:4:50|The lawyer packed up the agreement and left with a smile. On the other side, [Xiang Shaolong] was driving on the bustling street. Suddenly, a delivery man pulling a large basket of goods appeared in front of him.
0:5:7|0:5:13|The daughter [Ah Hei] had a blank expression on her face, wearing dirty overalls. The two then arrived at the entrance of a restaurant.
0:5:15|0:5:23|[Xiang Shaolong] pushed aside the door curtain and walked in, followed by [Sha Lu]. He saw many guests dining with their heads down and was taken aback.
0:6:38|0:6:49|[Xiang Shaolong] reached into his pocket, while [Sha Lu] stared at him intently. He took out a tissue to wipe his mouth, and continued to eat heartily.
0:6:50|0:6:58|He took out a toothpick from the other pocket and cleaned his teeth with it. [Ah Hei] rolled his eyes.
0:7:8|0:7:11|On the other side, [Sha Lu] arrives at the hospital. The camera switches, and a door opens.
0:7:38|0:7:46|[Xiang Shaolong] brings his fianc√©e [Jiang Yi] to their new home, and he unties the scarf covering her eyes and opens the curtains. [Xiang Shaolong] stands by the window.
0:8:0|0:8:3|He raised the key and knelt down on one knee. Aunt Jiang, with tears in her eyes, covered her mouth and walked towards another room.
0:9:27|0:9:29|Aunt Jiang looked at [Xiang Shaolong].
0:9:51|0:9:53|[Xiang Shaolong] embraces crying Aunt Jiang.
0:10:2|0:10:11|Soon, at night, [Sha Lu] passed by a real estate agency and picked up a flyer at the entrance. [Xiang Shaolong] stood alone by the wall on the street, smoking.
0:10:15|0:10:33|[Xiang Shaolong] walked towards the real estate agency with a lunch box in his hand, his attention caught by the sports car parked outside the company. On the other side, the young colleague [Very Wong] was playing with the nameplate of the intern. After carefully examining the sports car, [Xiang Shaolong] entered the company's office.
0:10:33|0:10:35|[Xiang Shaolong] stared at the intern as soon as he walked in.
0:10:50|0:10:52|[Xiang Shaolong] hesitated to speak.
0:11:12|0:11:15|[Xiang Shaolong] sighed.
0:11:23|0:11:33|[Very Wong] gets into a sports car and quickly drives away. [Xiang Shaolong] is alone in the office, opening a lunch box.
0:11:51|0:11:55|After hanging up the phone, [Xiang Shaolong] immediately called the client.
0:12:11|0:12:14|This is [Sha Lu] arriving at the agency.
0:12:38|0:12:51|Miss, Xiang Shaolong hangs up the phone and arrives at Wushuang Terrace with Sha Lu, Ah Hei, and Very Wong.
0:14:19|0:14:22|Four people arrived at the rooftop, [Ah Hei] looked at the distant night view and smiled.
0:14:59|0:15:4|Sha Lu did not express his opinion, he leaned over to [Xiang Shaolong] and said to him.
0:15:29|0:15:51|Sha Lu waved his hand and said, "I have seen many houses, but none of them can compare to this view." The camera then cuts to the four of them walking on the streets of Hong Kong. Each person had a happy smile on their face. They walked side by side among the skyscrapers, heading towards the law firm. Xiang Shaolong and Sha Lu each signed their names.
0:15:51|0:16:3|The law firm stamped the documents. The Five-Star Red Flag and the Purple Gold Flag fluttered in the wind on the street. The four of them acted in unison, flipping through and passing around documents in the office, signing each page of the contract.
0:16:39|0:16:52|After another set was taken by Xiang Shaolong, he wanted to hand it to Very Wong and [Ah Hei], but ended up putting it in his own pocket. The scene then shifts to the group arriving at the new house, with Very Wong smiling and pulling back the curtains, while Sha Lu kneels on the floor cleaning the floor.
0:16:52|0:17:1|When Vivi walked past the freshly cleaned floor, [Sha Lu] flicked her shoe with a rag, while [Very Wong] smiled and laid on the sofa, pulling out a brand new condom from the bottom crevice.
0:17:2|0:17:19|[Xiang Shaolong] looked at the rental form, checked it all over, and then put a tick on it. Wanrui and [Ah Hei] filled the bookshelf with decorative fake books, while [Sha Lu] placed a pot of garlic-like plants on the side. [Xiang Shaolong] sat at the table continuously ticking the form, while the others were tidying up the room.
0:17:20|0:17:33|Shortly after, the group sat on the ground, flipping through a pile of signed contracts. [Ah Hei] playfully scattered the papers around, [Xiang Shaolong] pretended to scold him, raising his arm. The camera then cut to [Xiang Shaolong] entering the kitchen, almost bumping into [Sha Lu] holding a vase.
0:17:33|0:17:42|[Ah Hei] came out from the other side, and the door happened to push [Xiang Shaolong] out of the room. The four of them arrived at the rooftop of the swimming pool building to celebrate. [Very Wong] lay on an air mattress in the pool, basking in the sun.
0:18:43|0:18:58|[Sha Lu] frowned and turned away from the rooftop. [Very Wong] stuck out his tongue at [Sha Lu]'s back, and the three of them followed [Sha Lu] with their eyes, holding champagne and following [Sha Lu] into the room. [Sha Lu] remained expressionless, ready for whatever was to come.
0:18:58|0:19:1|[Xiang Shaolong] followed behind him, chasing and talking.
0:19:14|0:19:18|Xiang Shaolong, Sha Lu, and Very Wong immediately ran to the elevator. The other four stood there dumbfounded.
0:19:51|0:20:0|In a flash, [Xiang Shaolong] brought the client to view the house. As soon as the bedroom door opened, they found someone lying on the bed. [Xiang Shaolong] entered the room and closed the bedroom door behind him.
0:20:6|0:20:8|[Sha Lu] sits up from the bed and dims the light.
0:20:20|0:20:31|The customer opened the bedroom door, [Sha Lu] disguised as a cleaner was cleaning, greeted by [Xiang Shaolong] with a smile. Then, he took a big gulp of water and swallowed it.
0:20:37|0:20:47|Xiang Shaolong lunged for the room key on the bedside table. The two of them wrestled on the bed. At that moment, [Ah Hei] received a phone call.
0:21:6|0:21:13|[Ahei] rushed over with bags in hand. [Sha Lu] was at home painting in high heels, while [Very Wong] stood by persuading.
0:21:56|0:22:9|[Sha Lu] scratched his head with a comb and left. Xiang Shaolong stood alone at the law firm with a frown. When he arrived at the apartment of the four people, the room was filled with smoke and decorations. Many people were gathered inside, and [Ah Hei] was also dancing energetically.
0:22:27|0:22:39|Vivian and [Ah Hei] lock Xiang Shaolong in a wooden cage, while Sha Lu sits on a rocking chair sipping red wine, with a bright smile on her face. After the party, the four of them then head to the law firm.
0:23:5|0:23:13|Xiang Shaolong started a fight without hesitation, accidentally knocking off Sha Lu's wig. The remaining three took the opportunity to pull Xiang Shaolong out of the office.
0:23:25|0:23:37|[Sha Lu] got on the car first, and the other three rushed to Room D in the apartment. The four of them pushed and shoved their way in, even alarming the old lady next door.
0:23:45|0:24:4|Xiang Shaolong also closed the door of the next room and took out the key. Ah Hei and [Very Wong] were fighting for the study. [Very Wong] turned around and was stunned, while Ah Hei entered a room and stuck a postcard on the wall.
0:24:16|0:24:34|Xiang Shaolong lay on the oversized teddy bear sofa, holding a rabbit plush toy in his hands. [Very Wong] finished speaking and left, the room decorated with floral wallpaper and filled with toys. On the other side, [Sha Lu] was placing her high heels in the common area.
0:25:18|0:25:27|Ah Hei pointed at the masked man who was shot down in the movie, [Very Wong] looked at him in astonishment. [Xiang Shaolong] had just finished taking a shower.
0:25:29|0:25:35|The torn vest on Xiang Shaolong's body was mocked by [Sha Lu]. After Sha Lu left, Xiang Shaolong saw a pile of garbage.
0:25:56|0:26:2|Xiang Shaolong was pushed down on his back, lying on the wires scattered on the floor, while the four of them stared at a black hair on the wall.
0:26:38|0:26:43|Ah Hei took a piece of board painting and covered it in front of the wall.
0:26:50|0:27:2|[Xiang Shaolong] mocked [Sha Lu] and left, while [Sha Lu] returned to her room. Wan Rui and Ah Hei exchanged smiles and went back to their rooms. Soon, it was the next morning.
0:27:16|0:27:36|Xiang Shaolong and the others were frantically tidying up the house. Xiang Shaolong put the toothbrush in the toilet tank, inserted a fake flower into the water pipe, hid leftover snacks in a fake book, and threw all the miscellaneous items on the table into the sliding coffee table.
0:28:1|0:28:18|[Sha Lu] walked out of the room in high heels, carrying utensils, muttering to [Xiang Shaolong] who was eating bread. The scene shifted to [Sha Lu] taking a taxi home, with a billboard on the roadside stating that the district councilor successfully advocated for the installation of glass doors in the market building.
0:28:46|0:28:54|[Sha Lu] had a happy smile on his face as the driver turned the direction and headed down the mountain. Holding a box of Lego in his hand, [Sha Lu] arrived at the councilor's office.
0:28:59|0:29:3|[Sha Lu] sits among the piles of paper and newspapers in the room, observing the full cabinet of files.
0:30:44|0:30:53|[Sha Lu] nodded at a staff member, and the scene shifted to [Xiang Shaolong] sleeping in the children's room. With the sound of the phone ringing, he searched around for his mobile phone.
0:31:19|0:31:23|[Ahei] is lying in the living room smoking a hookah, with smoke swirling in the air.
0:32:6|0:32:21|[Very Wong] finished speaking, revealing a standard smile with eight teeth. Subsequently, the other three individuals threw all the miscellaneous items in the living room onto [Very Wong]'s bed. With precision akin to shooting hoops, the group neatly stored away all the items on the bed.
0:32:21|0:32:29|This scene left [Very Wong] dumbfounded. [Xiang Shaolong] was busy opening the door to greet guests with his underwear showing.
0:32:32|0:32:34|He is [Very Wong], an intern at the company.
0:33:15|0:33:18|[Ahei] put down the cigarette in his hand, overturned the chess pieces on the table with one hand, and stood up to take off his clothes.
0:33:40|0:33:47|He threw his hat and scarf on the ground and walked briskly towards the door. [Xiang Shaolong]
0:34:8|0:34:20|[Sha Lu] nodded and got up to leave. On the other side, [Xiang Shaolong] sat alone on the steps of the slide, kicking off his high heels. At that moment, [Sha Lu] walked towards him with [Xiang Shaolong]'s slippers in hand.
0:34:21|0:34:25|[Ahei] glanced at [Sha Lu], nibbling on his nails.
0:34:44|0:34:49|Sha Lu sighed, Xiang Shaolong glanced at her, and then said.
0:35:40|0:36:1|My mom has been with so many men, only Xiang Shaolong. Sha Lu hesitated for a long time, picked up the slipper in her hand and handed it to Very Wong. Very Wong looked at the slipper handed by Sha Lu, then looked at Sha Lu's expectant eyes, sighed hesitantly, but did not take the slipper.
0:36:1|0:36:14|The scene shifts to a new real estate development under construction, where property salespeople are waiting at the intersection for customers. A taxi pulls up, and [Xiang Shaolong] and other property salespeople swarm around, surrounding the taxi.
0:36:18|0:36:22|[Xiang Shaolong] rushes towards a newly arrived small car.
0:36:46|0:36:49|[Sha Lu] immediately ran away when he saw an acquaintance.
0:37:5|0:37:7|The woman is a mediocre person, carrying the child.
0:37:44|0:37:48|The woman waved her hand, and the onlooker took the child away. [Sha Lu] smiled awkwardly.
0:38:5|0:38:14|Sha Lu turned her head away in despair, the woman's gaze fixed on the diamond ring on Sha Lu's ring finger, as Sha Lu hid her hand in her sleeve.
0:38:41|0:39:3|Xiang Shaolong handed the advertisement in the woman's hand and passed another sales order to her. The scene shifted, and the sky had darkened. The neighbor, an elderly lady, slowly walked over with a cane. Sitting on the steps at the entrance of the community were Xiang Shaolong and Sha Lu. They waved to the elderly lady, and Sha Lu also waved back and greeted her. Sha Lu nodded expressionlessly.
0:39:3|0:39:7|[Xiang Shaolong] looked at her, then at Ah Po. [Sha Lu] spoke.
0:42:31|0:42:33|[Xiang Shaolong] nodded.
0:42:44|0:42:47|[Sha Lu] had moist eyes, [Xiang Shaolong] turned his head to the side.
0:42:52|0:43:8|The scene shifts, [Ah Hei] squats by the roadside, stuffing the parcel in his hand into his bag. A bus approaches, [Ah Hei] quickly hoists up his huge backpack and chases after the bus. However, the bus doesn't stop, and [Ah Hei] struggles to catch up to the red light at the intersection, pounding on the side of the bus.
0:43:16|0:43:39|The driver glanced back at [Ah Hei] outside the car door and drove away without looking back. [Ah Hei] was left standing in the middle of the road, panting as he watched the bus leave. He angrily threw the package on the ground, kicked it a few times, and then walked briskly in the opposite direction. The remaining pile of packages scattered in the middle of the road.
0:43:39|0:43:42|On the other side, Xiang Shaolong's fianc√©e, Aunt Jiang, arrived at his company.
0:43:48|0:44:2|[Xiang Shaolong] immediately stepped forward. He settled [Aunt Jiang] in a chair on the side and tidied up the documents on the table.
0:44:19|0:44:25|The sudden appearance of the boss interrupted the conversation between the two, [Xiang Shaolong] was about to leave, but then remembered [Aunt Jiang] and turned back.
0:44:29|0:44:45|[Aunt Jiang] was about to leave when [Xiang Shaolong] grabbed her arm and took out a box from under the desk. Inside the box was a pair of beautifully crafted high heels. [Xiang Shaolong] took out one shoe and held it up in front of her. [Aunt Jiang] took the shoe in surprise.
0:45:32|0:45:36|[Xiang Shaolong] raised the folder in his hand. As the group set off, just as they stepped out, [Xiang Shaolong] ran into an acquaintance.
0:46:26|0:46:40|Mr. Xu handed the Samoyed's leash to [Xiang Shaolong], as the car drove away. The Samoyed struggled to break free from the leash and chase after the car, while [Xiang Shaolong] exerted all his strength to hold onto the leash, looking quite comical and ridiculous.
0:46:40|0:46:59|On the other side, [Sha Lu] paced back and forth in the kitchen at home. She looked at the sun outside the curtains, the sunlight shining on her face, casting particularly charming shadows. She seemed a bit restless, using her hands to pound on the table and pacing back and forth. On the table were her phone and a beautiful desk lamp.
0:47:1|0:47:16|She thought for a moment, picked up the phone on the table, unlocked it, wrote "husband" on the screen, and sent it. Then she stared at the phone screen intently. At this moment, the status under her husband's name changed to "typing".
0:47:17|0:47:32|[Sha Lu] smiled, but it quickly disappeared as she typed on her phone. She put down the phone, tears welling up in her eyes. She rested her arms on the table, hands covering her eyes, and forcefully pushed her short hair back.
0:47:32|0:47:40|She placed the suitcase on the kitchen table, and upon opening it, she found neatly organized kitchen utensils inside, along with many tools for making desserts.
0:47:41|0:47:59|On the other side, [Xiang Shaolong] is waiting by the roadside for Xu Zicong to return, with a Samoyed tied to a fire hydrant nearby. There is some poop behind its butt. [Xiang Shaolong] picks up the phone to call Xu Zicong, but the call is not answered.
0:48:17|0:48:36|[Xiang Shaolong] picked up the advertisement paper and scooped up the poop on the ground. Then he squatted in front of the trash can and threw it in. His phone beeped with a text message. Opening it, he saw a message from manager Weiwen saying, "Very Wong is amazing. He brought in customers as soon as he arrived on site, and this customer bought three houses in one go."
0:48:36|0:48:46|[Xiang Shaolong] immediately felt frustrated, pounded his head with his fist, looked around, slowly got up, walked towards the side of [Sha Lu], and picked up the folder on the ground.
0:48:47|0:48:56|At this moment, [Xu Zicong] held a book in his hand and approached from behind. [Xiang Shaolong] instantly smiled and turned towards [Xu Zicong].
0:49:18|0:49:32|[Xu Zicong] handed the book to [Xiang Shaolong], quickly squatted down, untied the dog leash on the fire hydrant, took the book and walked away with [Sha Lu]. [Xiang Shaolong] stood alone at the company's entrance, heaved a long sigh.
0:49:34|0:49:48|On the other side, [Sha Lu] is at home making exquisite desserts. She carefully squeezes cream onto the cupcake, admires her work for a moment, and then delicately places each small cake on the cake stand.
0:49:48|0:49:58|The cake stand was filled to the brim, [Sha Lu] looked at the fruits of her hard work with satisfaction, smiled, and took out her phone, as if anticipating something.
0:49:58|0:50:12|Nodding to himself, [Sha Lu] continued to decorate the cake stand in front of him, whipped cream made by him. Two cakes decorated with flowers were placed beside, with a sign saying "Happy Anniversary" on the cakes.
0:50:12|0:50:26|[Sha Lu] became more and more impatient as she poured a whole can of sugar into the bowl with a fierce expression. After stirring for a few moments, she took out her phone and stared at the screen. She repeatedly picked up the phone, but still did not receive any messages.
0:50:28|0:50:51|Until all the cake stands were filled by him, he stared blankly at the table, slowly stirring the cream in his hand. Then, he picked up his phone and watched as the time jumped from 23:59 to 0:00. He stared straight ahead, expressionless, with the hand holding the phone dropping down, tears swirling in his eyes.
0:50:51|0:50:54|[Sha Lu] walked into the living room and saw [Xiang Shaolong] sitting on the sofa, trimming his nails.
0:51:28|0:51:34|[Sha Lu] nodded, bowed and walked towards the kitchen, frowned at [Xiang Shaolong], his gaze following him.
0:51:35|0:51:51|[Sha Lu] entered the kitchen, tears in her eyes. She picked up a cupcake that she had made herself, clenched her fist and crushed it fiercely. The cupcake, along with the corners of her mouth, fell down. Slowly, she picked up another piece and crushed it in the same way.
0:51:52|0:52:6|The cake and cream were stuck on his hands, no matter how hard he tried to rub them off. Tears welled up in his eyes and streamed down his cheeks. Unable to contain his sadness, [Sha Lu] looked at the clumps of cake on his hands and eventually cried out.
0:52:10|0:52:25|Following that, he grabbed a round cake from the dessert table and forcefully threw it on the ground. Then, he overturned a three-tier anniversary cake on the table and used a rolling pin thicker than his own arm to pound the collapsed cake.
0:52:26|0:52:41|In the living room, [Xiang Shaolong] was completely unaware of everything until he heard a knocking sound. He perked up his ears to locate the source of the sound, and before long, he was dozing off on the sofa, furrowing his brow and sighing, then pondering about something.
0:52:42|0:53:2|[Xiang Shaolong] got up and walked to the kitchen, stretching his arms and legs. As soon as he entered the kitchen, he was stunned by the messy table in front of him. He walked up to [Sha Lu] and at the same time, [Sha Lu] carefully decorated a plate of jelly and placed it in front of [Xiang Shaolong].
0:53:14|0:53:20|And picked up a small spoon, sending the jelly into the mouth.
0:53:32|0:53:51|[Sha Lu] slowly approached [Xiang Shaolong], who took a few steps back until his back was against the refrigerator. [Sha Lu] grabbed his neck and kissed him wildly. At that moment, [Xiang Shaolong] took the initiative and tried to tear off [Sha Lu]'s clothes.
0:54:1|0:54:6|Xiang Shaolong and Very Wong arrived at Sha Lu's bed. Xiang Shaolong threw Sha Lu's apron on the ground and turned off the lights.
0:54:22|0:54:29|The camera cuts to a beautiful and fair-skinned rich girl with long legs walking out from behind a portrait.
0:54:45|0:54:47|An old man walked down the stairs.
0:55:0|0:55:9|[Very Wong] carefully examined the art sculpture pointed out by the wealthy father, pursed his lips and said. The wealthy father chuckled.
0:55:15|0:55:22|The beautiful woman laughed happily beside him, and her father turned his back, continuing to admire other works of art.
0:55:28|0:55:35|[Xiang Shaolong], who is playing with real estate ads, sees the foreign client borrowed by Aunt Jiang passing by the store front.
0:55:56|0:55:59|[Xiang Shaolong] tightly pulled his sleeve.
0:56:8|0:56:17|On the other side, [Sha Lu], who was strolling on the street, received a call from [Xiang Shaolong]. [Sha Lu] arrived at Grandma's house. [Sha Lu] was twisting the lid of the thermos. Grandma took the phone.
0:56:48|0:57:4|[Sha Lu] handed the thermos to Grandma, got up and walked to the window. Her expression suddenly turned serious as she saw [Ah Hei] in the room wearing a suspender skirt, unfastening one shoulder strap while looking in the mirror.
0:57:6|0:57:17|[Sha Lu] went out to continue observing in secret, while [Xiang Shaolong] was wearing a suspender skirt with a denim jacket on the outside, standing by the roadside. At this moment, a D4 stopped next to [Xiang Shaolong].
0:57:23|0:57:37|The people in the car handed over a stack of banknotes, which [Ah Hei] took and carefully examined in his hand. [Xiang Shaolong] drove over. [Sha Lu], [Ah Hei], and [Very Wong] were waiting for him at the playground slide in the residential area.
0:58:24|0:58:31|Xiang Shaolong hangs up the phone. [Ah Hei] sits on the steps of the slide.
0:58:38|0:58:41|Xiang Shaolong walked up to [Ah Hei] with a look of surprise on his face.
0:58:57|0:58:59|[Ah Hei] said he works very hard.
0:59:24|0:59:26|[Ahei] finished speaking and turned to leave.
1:1:11|1:1:16|Xiang Shaolong reached out and held hands with [Very Wong], who then held hands with [Sha Lu].
1:1:17|1:1:25|Sha Lu placed her hand on Xiang Shaolong's and Very Wong's hands, the four of them formed a circle holding hands, closed their eyes and lowered their heads.
1:1:56|1:1:59|After a brief eye contact with [Sha Lu], Xiang Shaolong turned his head and rushed into the house.
1:2:7|1:2:9|[Ahei] stared at Xiang Shaolong's face.
1:2:17|1:2:27|Xiang Shaolong's curly facial hair stood out. Wan Rui and [Sha Lu] smiled, Xu Zicong's girlfriend [Very Wong], with a bright house, a neat hairstyle, ran out.
1:2:30|1:2:34|Xu Zicong pushed Xiang Shaolong aside. Xiang Shaolong was plunged into memories of buying a house.
1:3:21|1:3:26|You bought this house, [Xu Zicong] pulled his girlfriend aside.
1:5:16|1:5:38|[Beautiful Woman] handed a check to Xiang Shaolong, who caught it immediately. [Ah Hei] suddenly appeared and snatched the check. He stuffed the check into his mouth. [Xu Zicong] stared at Xiang Shaolong's face.
1:6:13|1:6:15|[Very Wong] looked at Xu Zicong and questioned.
1:6:30|1:6:45|Bai Fengmei turned and left, [Xu Zicong] looked at the door and lowered his head. Ah Hei helped [Sha Lu], who was sitting on the ground, to sit on the sofa. [Xu Zicong] turned around, facing the four people in the room, raised his arm, and then helplessly put it down.
1:6:45|1:6:53|He walked to the dining table, sat slowly on a chair, licked his lips, looked around the four people with a vacant gaze, and said.
1:8:18|1:8:27|[Xu Zicong] kicked fiercely, overturned the dining table, then bent over to hold his rheumatic leg, and walked up to [Xiang Shaolong].
1:8:32|1:8:55|[Xu Zicong] picked up the hat from the ground, stood up and said. After speaking, he limped towards the door. [Xiang Shaolong] leaned against the dining counter and slowly squatted down.
1:9:45|1:9:51|[Sha Lu] sat on the sofa, nodding slightly.
1:9:55|1:10:11|The night darkens, [Xiang Shaolong] is alone on the balcony smoking. The camera slowly moves up, [Sha Lu] is on the rooftop, resting his head on his hands, lost in thought. In the pitch-black sky, apart from a few dark clouds, there is no sign of any light.
1:10:11|1:10:23|The scene shifts to Xiang Shaolong and [Aunt Jiang] sitting side by side on a bench by the seaside, looking at the brightly lit pier. Xiang Shaolong lowers his head as [Aunt Jiang] speaks.
1:10:45|1:10:49|[Aunt Jiang] sighed and looked at [Xiang Shaolong].
1:10:57|1:11:5|He stood up with a backpack on his back, furrowing his brow, tears swirling in his eyes, [Xiang Shaolong] also stood up, facing each other.
1:11:7|1:11:15|After speaking, [Madame Jiang] hugged [Xiang Shaolong], while [Sha Lu] stood aside, watching everything. [Xiang Shaolong] also held [Madame Jiang] tightly, refusing to let go.
1:11:15|1:11:24|In the end, [Madam Jiang] pushed away [Xiang Shaolong], grabbed the nearby suitcase and left. At this moment, [Sha Lu] suddenly approached [Madam Jiang].
1:11:32|1:11:47|Aunt Jiang swept down on [Sha Lu] and finally locked her gaze on the delicate high heels she was wearing. She lifted her head and looked at [Sha Lu] expressionlessly.
1:12:32|1:12:42|[Sha Lu] listened and then turned to stare blankly at [Xiang Shaolong]. [Xiang Shaolong] also stared at [Sha Lu] until Aunt Jiang looked at him, then he turned his gaze back to Aunt Jiang.
1:12:49|1:13:10|Jiang Yila lifted the suitcase and left. [Xiang Shaolong] watched Jiang Yila's departing figure, took a step forward to follow, but couldn't catch up, his gaze following him all the way. [Xiang Shaolong] and [Sha Lu] stood still, both silent. Then, the two walked side by side on the pedestrian bridge by the sea.
1:13:10|1:13:28|The two characters gazed ahead, surrounded by towering buildings in the night. The dazzling neon lights accentuated their loneliness. They walked to the seaside, feeling the sea breeze and watching the quiet waves rolling endlessly. And so, they arrived at the drive-in theater.
1:14:19|1:14:34|Sha [Sha Lu] held a diamond ring in his hand, carefully examining the large and shiny diamond before casually throwing it on the ground. He sat cross-legged on the bed, with a suitcase in front of him containing a variety of exquisite high-heeled shoes, which were particularly dazzling.
1:14:36|1:14:57|Then, he closed the box, propped his forearm on it, tears in his eyes. The scene shifts, [Sha Lu] is on the street, holding a flyer in one hand, biting the knuckles of the other hand, searching for something in the crowd. On the other side, [Xiang Shaolong] is lying on the children's sofa at home, disheveled.
1:14:57|1:15:5|Sha Lu returned home and saw this scene, as well as an empty wine bottle on the table next to it. She frowned and squatted down beside Xiang Shaolong.
1:15:22|1:15:31|[Xiang Shaolong] closed his eyes again and fell back asleep. The scene then shifted to the factory where [Ah Hei] worked, with workers busy loading and unloading goods onto trucks.
1:15:54|1:16:13|[Xiang Shaolong] looked at [Ah Hei] with a worried expression, while [Sha Lu] looked at [Xiang Shaolong]. The three of them arrived at a iron gate with a password. After glancing around, [Ah Hei] entered the password and the gate slowly opened. There was only a small glass window on the door, through which they could see outside. The room was pitch black.
1:16:13|1:16:16|The narrow aisle is lined with doors made of iron mesh.
1:16:23|1:16:25|[Very Wong] closed the door behind him.
1:16:41|1:16:55|[Ah Hei] introduced the two to the documents neatly arranged on the shelves in the iron cage, with pages of paper placed in an orderly manner. [Xiang Shaolong] looked through the iron cage at these property deeds and walked alone towards the depths.
1:16:55|1:17:4|The iron mesh divided the house deed into small cage-like rooms, with [Xiang Shaolong] standing in the center. The top lights behind him flickered one after another as he continued walking inside.
1:17:5|1:17:25|[Sha Lu] poked his head out behind him, following [Ah Hei] behind [Xiang Shaolong], each of them looking at what was in front of them. [Xiang Shaolong] raised his head, sneered, and the camera pulled back to a distance, the lighting in the entire warehouse where the devices were placed was very dim, like a huge maze.
1:17:25|1:17:30|The scene changes, the elevator doors slowly open, and three people walk out of the elevator.
1:17:36|1:17:43|[Ahei] turned around, pressed the button of another elevator, and walked into the elevator car. [Sha Lu] and [Xiang Shaolong] walked out.
1:17:55|1:17:59|[Xiang Shaolong] stood with his hands in his pockets, looking at [Sha Lu] with a puzzled expression.
1:19:6|1:19:15|The two of them walked to the street corner, smiled at each other, and stopped in their tracks. [Xiang Shaolong] looked at [Sha Lu] and said solemnly.
1:19:33|1:19:50|Speak up, [Sha Lu] opened his arms, and the two embraced tightly, spinning around. The scene shifted, [Xiang Shaolong] in pajamas, stood in [Ah Hei]'s room, playing with a lamp. After turning it on, [Xiang Shaolong] affectionately rubbed [Ah Hei]'s face.
1:19:50|1:19:53|The scene shifts, [Xiang Shaolong] arrives at a new real estate agency to work.
1:19:58|1:20:9|He took the food handed to him by his senior colleagues and ate it carefully. Meanwhile, [Very Wong] sat at the company's entrance, handing out property advertisements to passersby.
1:20:9|1:20:25|[Ahei] is working in the construction site, pulling goods from the city and countryside with the Nangong team. [Sha Lu] is standing in front of the blackboard teaching, with English written all over it. The students sitting below are a group of middle-aged and elderly people dozing off. A notice of debt suddenly appears in front of the camera, prominently displaying the words.
1:20:37|1:20:52|[Sha Lu] handed a paper bag to [Xiang Shaolong], who changed into new pajamas and walked up to [Sha Lu]. He kissed [Sha Lu] and then pushed her down in his childhood room.
1:21:6|1:21:22|With only two days left until the deadline for returning the house, the four of them were having a barbecue on the rooftop. [Xiang Shaolong] and [Sha Lu] had their arms around each other, while [Very Wong] also confessed to [Ah Hei]. In the next scene, [Sha Lu] showed up at [Xiang Shaolong]'s company to deliver food. Suddenly, [Very Wong] called.
1:21:44|1:21:50|When [Sha Lu] and [Xiang Shaolong] arrived at the airport, many intermediaries had been waiting for a long time, being blocked by security guards in the aisle.
1:22:1|1:22:13|Xiang Shaolong was immediately arranged by the entourage to leave from the back door. Many intermediaries followed suit, with Very Wong and Sha Lu at the back of the crowd. When Xiang Shaolong turned around, Aunt Jiang was right behind him.
1:22:14|1:22:27|Aunt Jiang looked at [Sha Lu] beside him, and the three of them felt a bit awkward. Then, Aunt Jiang used her own public transportation card to swipe open the glass door next to her, turned to [Xiang Shaolong], and glanced at Mr. Shi who had already walked far away.
1:22:31|1:22:36|[Sha Lu] also casually grabbed a bottle of mineral water from the table. The two intercepted the road by taking a shortcut.
1:22:41|1:23:4|[Sha Lu] handed the water to Mr. Shi, and they ran while talking. Behind them, a group of people holding real estate ads rushed past. As they ran, a piece of advertisement paper fluttered to the ground.
1:23:10|1:23:15|Sha Lu was lifted up, Mr. Shi ran away. Both of them were knocked down by a group of people.
1:23:18|1:23:37|A car stopped in front of Mr. Shi, and several people quickly got in. Xiang Shaolong struggled to push away the group of real estate salespeople. The driver, unexpectedly, was Very Wong. With a sharp turn, he left the real estate brokers far behind.
1:23:37|1:23:46|[Ahei] goes against traffic, narrowly avoiding two cars, and pulls [Xiang Shaolong], [Sha Lu], and [Mr. Shi] out of the car, along with the assistant playing the role of a mysterious princess, screaming in violation of the rules.
1:23:50|1:24:5|With the roar of the engine and the intimidating black smoke from the exhaust, Xiang Shaolong chased after as if driving a race car, even forcing oncoming vehicles to stop. [Ah Hei] drove onto a bridge and saw through the rearview mirror the cars behind crazily chasing after.
1:24:5|1:24:10|[Ahei] remains calm, smoothly shifting gears and accelerating, leading the pack of cars from a distance.
1:24:39|1:24:49|Other real estate agents' cars followed closely behind, [Ah Hei] smoothly turned into a roundabout. At that moment, a McLaren cut in from the side and forced the other vehicles to a stop.
1:24:49|1:24:57|[Very Wong] drove the McLaren alongside [Sha Lu] and [Ah Hei], pointing outside the window in surprise to [Xiang Shaolong], while the others in the car looked towards [Very Wong].
1:24:57|1:25:3|[Ahei] gave a thumbs up to [Very Wong], who ran his thumb across his nose and made a cool gesture.
1:25:4|1:25:13|Following that, [Ah Hei] pointed to his own eyes and then gestured towards the back, indicating [Very Wong], who then drove out along the roundabout.
1:25:13|1:25:33|[Ahei] had a smooth journey here. Several people met up with [Very Wong], the car didn't even stop, and [Very Wong] opened the door and got into the passenger seat. They headed towards the road that must pass through Wushuang Terrace. Workers were diligently coloring the original lines on the ground.
1:25:35|1:25:55|The useless road signs were also removed, and a large poster of the councilor was hung up behind the road, with the words "Successfully improved traffic congestion in Ban Shan, changing the one-way road sign to two-way, lowering the minimum speed to 70 mph, and painting over the stop lines on the road. The female councilor stood on the side of the road waving and greeting passersby.
1:25:55|1:25:59|The cameraman is also on the side shooting.
1:26:13|1:26:23|Xiang Shaolong and Sha Lu, with Mr. Shi in between, picked it up in the car. The group arrived at Wushuang Terrace.
1:26:42|1:26:47|The two assistants sat on the side, looking at the documents. Xiang Shaolong and [Sha Lu] opened the balcony door.
1:27:4|1:27:26|Mr. Shi hugged Xiang Shaolong's face, kissed him, then kissed him again, and smiled. Mr. Shi looked at his assistant sitting next to him, the assistant gave him a thumbs-up gesture, and he reached out his right hand to Sha Lu.
1:27:37|1:27:55|When the two were about to hug, Xiang Shaolong intervened. Xiang Shaolong excitedly embraced [Sha Lu] and spun around in place.
1:28:2|1:28:6|After Xiang Shaolong finished speaking, the remaining three people stared quietly at his face.
1:28:19|1:28:34|Everyone laughed happily, the four of them hugged together, cheering joyfully. The camera then switched to an African beauty sitting at the back of an open truck. [Very Wong] and [Sha Lu] waved their hands towards the truck.
1:28:48|1:29:7|The scene shifts to a lakeside far from the city, with several three-story buildings around. [Sha Lu] is inside, flipping through letters and smiling happily. She hands two postcards to [Xiang Shaolong] who is watering plants, then opens another letter and takes out a flyer filled with property listings.
1:29:12|1:29:32|[Xiang Shaolong] took the advertisement from his hand, [Sha Lu] smiled at him and walked away. He crumpled the advertisement and threw it into the nearby trash can. Then, the two of them rolled up their sleeping bags, with many outdoor items still on the table in front of them. They playfully packed their bags while having a good time.
1:29:52|1:30:4|They packed their bags and ran happily on the slope, arriving at a lush meadow for camping. [Sha Lu] walked out of the tent and sat on a small chair opposite [Xiang Shaolong].
1:30:15|1:30:20|The two of them ran freely hand in hand on the grass.
