0:0:35|0:0:55|In the distance, the mountains undulated like camel humps for miles. At this moment, a man was running up from the foot of the mountain, his figure gradually approaching. It could be seen that he had an ammunition box slung diagonally on his left side, a cloth bundle on his right, and a rifle slung behind him. He was lean but strong.
0:0:55|0:1:11|Running swiftly among the mountains, only one figure can be seen in the vast mountain ranges. His pace quickens, never stopping for a moment. After crossing another mountain, his movements become slower, but he does not stop to rest, instead continuing to run forward.
0:1:11|0:1:25|The mountain road became increasingly difficult to traverse. Zhang Side increased the swinging force of his arms, lowered his center of gravity, but even with such caution, he almost stumbled. He climbed up a steep slope using both hands and feet, with the cliff slanting and loose rocks constantly rolling down. Beads of sweat dripped from his forehead.
0:1:25|0:1:33|He looked into the distance to estimate how much further there was to go. At this moment, the camera zoomed in and focused on his face, revealing that this person is [Zhang Side].
0:1:33|0:1:50|At the same time, on the big stage, several children sat together, chatting and laughing. They held peanuts and melon seeds in their hands. The little girl wore a big flowered jacket, with her hair tied into two small braids. The little boy wore new cloth shoes from home. The children all had innocent smiles on their faces.
0:1:54|0:1:58|[Zhang Side] was pushed onto the stage with a curtain hastily.
0:3:8|0:3:24|[Zhang Side] had a bright look in his eyes, his mouth forming an "O" shape as he sang the song with great enthusiasm. After listening, [Mao Zedong] had a face full of admiration.
0:3:51|0:3:53|Liu Bingzhong rode on [Zhang Side]'s shoulders to repair the electric lamp.
0:3:58|0:4:23|[Mao Zedong] and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De were comically exaggerated in their commanding actions by Xiao Bai. As the song ended, everyone excitedly applauded. During the evening break, Da Li went to take a bath, carrying a basin and walking into the kitchen from outside.
0:4:29|0:4:33|Xiao Bai sat on the kang and took off his shoes, looking defiant. [Zhang Side] then returned from outside.
0:5:43|0:5:53|Da Li extinguished the kerosene lamp, but [Zhang Side] did not go to sleep. He walked out of the room holding a bundle of straw and saw the old revolutionary grinding beans like a millstone. He wanted to walk over and help.
0:5:53|0:6:7|[Zhang Side] grabbed the handle, only to be pushed away by the old revolutionary. He grabbed it again, but was pushed away once more. The old revolutionary, in a Western suit, looked angry and even raised his hand to hit him. [Zhang Side] stopped arguing with him, smiled foolishly a few times, walked to the doorstep and sat down, tidying up the straw in the moonlight.
0:6:8|0:6:14|He turned to the old revolutionary, his eyes clear and full of respect. One morning, everyone gathered at the door.
0:7:35|0:8:0|After Chairman Mao finished speaking, he turned and walked towards the car. [Zhang Side] smiled foolishly, full of admiration. The stolen car slowly started, and they arrived at the Liberation Daily office. A crowd of people gathered in the small area, and when they saw the Chairman getting off the car, they all applauded warmly. [Zhang Side] was the first to jump off the car and escorted the Chairman out.
0:8:9|0:8:21|Chairman Mao Zedong greeted the comrades warmly and kindly. Some were playing the accordion, while others were playing the erhu, creating a lively atmosphere. After the inspection, the car drove along a narrow mountain road.
0:9:13|0:9:25|[Zhang Side] quickly jumped out of the car, picked up Song Guangming and placed him on a pile of grass on the side. Despite being in a hurry, his movements were very gentle. He helped [Song Guangming] take off his pants, then turned to take the paper from Auntie's hand, busy and bustling for a while.
0:9:29|0:9:45|[Zhang Side] is very patient with [Song Guangming], speaking in a very gentle tone. He helps [Song Guangming] put on his pants and sends him back to the car. After everything is taken care of, he quickly runs back to his own position. The car starts slowly and heads towards the kindergarten, but [Song Guangming] still feels uncomfortable in his stomach, and soon starts to feel pain again.
0:9:45|0:9:49|[Qiu Yuemei] quickly stopped the car as the other children inside mockingly shouted.
0:9:58|0:10:21|[Zhang Side] quickly opened the car door and carried [Song Zhuangmin] out. They arrived at the riverbank and carefully washed the child with river water. Teased by [Qiu Yuemei] in this way, [Zhang Side] couldn't help but just smile foolishly and continue washing the child. Auntie was deeply moved by this scene.
0:10:37|0:10:55|[Zhang Side] carefully dried Song Guangming with his clothes, then wrapped the clothes tightly around him and took out some candy from his pocket. Song Guangming shook his head. The female teachers were still washing his clothes by the river. [Zhang Side] played with him for a while before the group set off again.
0:10:55|0:11:17|After the children arrived safely, [Zhang Side] quickly came to Yan'an. The new market in Yan'an was bustling with people, and at this moment, [Zhang Side] was helping to unload goods at the warehouse in the southern area of the Military Service Society. Despite being covered in sweat, he was still full of energy. After putting the grain on the shelves and getting ready to leave, Liu Bingzhong called out to him.
0:11:17|0:11:20|However, Zhang Side continued to transport the grain.
0:11:29|0:11:38|After the arrangements were made, Liu Bingzhong limped into the room. [Zhang Side], who had just finished unloading the goods, was also here. He scooped a cup of water from the water tank, Director Liu.
0:12:55|0:13:1|Zhang Side and Mao Zedong came with lollipops to find Song Guangming.
0:14:16|0:14:31|Song Guangming didn't want to listen to his nagging and ran off in a huff. [Zhang Side] didn't blame him, got up and went after him. Liu Bingzhong turned around, saw that everyone had left, hurriedly got up and caught up. As a result, he slipped and almost fell. [Zhang Side] held Song Guangming and pointed to the galloping horse on the bridge.
0:14:31|0:14:38|The child's wrinkled face finally broke into a smile. [Zhang Side] looked at him with a loving gaze. They looked just like a father and son.
0:14:39|0:14:56|[Zhang Side] calmed the children down and then got busy with work. The group drove along a mountain road, responsible for escorting the Chairman. Suddenly, the car stalled in the middle of the road and couldn't move forward. [Zhang Side] quickly jumped out of the car, squatted down to check on it, and his comrades also hurriedly got out of the car to help.
0:14:56|0:15:10|[Zhang Side] looked nervous and quickly went to the back seat to get a bucket. At this moment, Chairman [Mao Zedong] also opened the door and came down, holding a cigarette and smoking as he walked. He casually glanced around and finally stood in front of the car, gazing into the distance.
0:15:20|0:15:28|The two of them walked forward, with the squad leader quickly catching up. At the same time, Zhang Side had already fetched water and was running back quickly.
0:15:42|0:15:54|[Zhang Side], come here. The Chairman hands the item to the squad leader, slowly squatting down to drink water with his hands.
0:17:8|0:17:13|[Zhang Side] was pleasantly surprised as he took the blind chicken handed to him by the Chairman.
0:17:37|0:17:47|Soon, Chairman Mao and his entourage arrived at the destination. The soldiers had already lined up, ready for inspection. The car slowly pulled in, and Zhang Side opened the door, with Wang Beard waiting in front of the car.
0:17:50|0:18:11|Chairman Mao got off the car, shook hands with the leader Wang Huzi, then waved cheerfully to the soldiers, applause filled the air, everyone was very excited. The journalists walked in the front taking photos, Chairman Mao smiled and clapped along with everyone, walked slowly into the factory building, where a sign was posted at the entrance, with the slogan "Friendship", he personally sealed more than a dozen large characters.
0:18:42|0:18:53|Chairman Ren Bishi, Wang Huzi, and Zhang Side went to discuss work. At this time, Zhang Side was working hard to clean the car. Lao Cao and others opened the hood of the car to further investigate the car's issues, and the squad leader came to bring them food.
0:19:11|0:19:23|The lively cheering ahead caught the attention of [Zhang Side]. At the foot of the mountain, two people were currently competing in grass digging. Xiaobai gradually ran out of energy, and her speed slowed down. She threw down the hoe, sat on the ground with a weak body, and felt powerless.
0:19:40|0:19:56|We see Dali wrinkling his hat, dropping his backpack, and picking up a hoe to start digging. The people beside him are also unwilling to show weakness, lifting their straw hats to settle the score. Their movements are fast and forceful, while Xiao Bai is on the side shouting words of encouragement through life and death. [Zhang Side] nervously looks in their direction, not even bothering to eat.
0:19:56|0:20:0|But not long after, Zhang Side also couldn't hold on, he angrily threw down his weapon and withdrew from the competition.
0:20:3|0:20:14|[Zhang Side] ran over to them, with food still in his mouth. As he walked, [Zhang Side] untied his scarf, used his foot to prop up the corpse's head, regardless of whether anyone was around, and started digging directly.
0:20:14|0:20:30|The speed is very fast, and the frustration of Dali and Xiaobai is swept away. The soldiers around slowly stood up, looking at [Zhang Side] with incredulous eyes. The land softened more and more under the excavation of [Zhang Side], only to see his determined gaze and faster movements, everyone couldn't help but cheer.
0:21:17|0:21:32|[Zhang Side] felt weak in the legs, Xiaobai and Dali quickly drove him back. The group set off from here, the roof of the car was full of food, including flour, pork, and watermelon, all kinds of things. The main flag sat in the front passenger seat, smiling and enjoying the scenery outside the window.
0:21:32|0:21:46|The purpose of their trip is the Central Hospital, where injured soldiers can be seen everywhere. With the help of medical staff, they are walking slowly, while the severely injured can only lie on stretchers. The car stops at the hospital entrance, and [Zhang Side] and Dali carry a door of pork and a bag of fruits ready to go in.
0:21:52|0:21:57|The two looked over and saw the wounded soldier on the stretcher gritting his teeth in agony.
0:22:2|0:22:11|After completing the mission, everyone returned to their residence, only to see [Zhang Side] and a few others wiping the military flag on the stone table at the door. Xiaobai had just finished washing clothes, while [Zhang Side] was carrying a basin of cement, preparing to repair the roof.
0:22:21|0:22:27|[Zhang Side] climbs up the ladder carefully to patch up the hole. Outside the door, the leader and the guards pass through the mountain path.
0:22:27|0:22:45|Walking quickly towards the courtyard, when they saw the leader approaching, everyone stopped their activities and stood up to salute and greet them. The leader responded warmly to each one, but did not stop walking. They walked straight towards a room, and everyone was very curious about this posture. Zhang Side and his comrades kept glancing over there, all wanting to know what wind had blown the leader here.
0:22:46|0:22:57|The two leaders walked into a room, followed closely by the guards who closed the door. [Zhang Side] and others ran to the window of the room to eavesdrop. Inside the room, the leader stood solemnly by the bed, while the guards took notes.
0:23:15|0:23:26|[Zhang Side] stopped his men and looked in their direction. The guard wrote down the words and handed them to the old revolutionary to read. The old revolutionary looked anxious, wanting to say something, but being a disabled person, he couldn't speak.
0:23:39|0:23:53|Upon hearing this, [Zhang Side] the old revolutionary burst into tears. Seeing him like this, the leader dismissed the eavesdroppers outside the door and had to give up for the time being. He snatched the notebook from the guard's hand, wrote a big word "fool" on it, and left it next to the meal on the table before leaving.
0:23:53|0:24:1|The next day, Chairman Mao Zedong went to the senior cadres' club by car. When the car stopped, Zhang Side immediately jumped out of the car, escorted the Chairman, and blocked the crowd behind him.
0:24:10|0:24:12|At this moment, [Zhang Side] is rushing to find Liu Bingzhou.
0:25:6|0:25:10|[Zhang Side] picked up the glasses placed on the table by Liu Bingzhong and gestured on his face.
0:26:22|0:26:38|[Zhang Side] turned a deaf ear and quickly ran out of the small shop. He went to the canteen and brought back two bowls of rice, carefully entering the room of the old revolutionary. The old revolutionary was sitting on the kang smoking a pipe. When he saw [Zhang Side] coming, he quickly rolled up his tobacco pouch and lay down on his side. Seeing this, [Zhang Side] spoke up to persuade him.
0:26:38|0:26:59|The old revolutionary, as if he hadn't heard anything, didn't even look at him. The two of them kept waiting until the afternoon, until the dinner bell rang. The old revolutionary habitually sat in front of the millstone, starting to grind soy milk. [Zhang Side] walked out of the room, went up and snatched the handle of the millstone. The old revolutionary was anxious and refused to let go.
0:27:10|0:27:18|[Zhang Side] understood his intention and was about to speak to persuade him. The old revolutionary stood up and sat at the door. [Zhang Side] looked at him blankly, not knowing what to do.
0:27:30|0:27:45|[Zhang Side] slowly got up and felt helpless seeing the old revolutionary in such a state. After calming down, the old revolutionary started sewing, but his eyesight was already failing and he couldn't thread the needle for a long time. [Zhang Side] took the glasses he had borrowed from Liu Bingzhong in the morning and put them on the old revolutionary.
0:27:45|0:27:56|The scene suddenly became clear, the thread passed through the needle eye in an instant. The old revolutionary was momentarily stunned, standing still. He looked up excitedly at [Zhang Side], expressing his joy at being able to see clearly, smiling broadly.
0:27:57|0:28:9|The old revolutionary continued his work, while [Zhang Side] went to the side to spin the reel. [Zhang Side] watched him easily thread the line, laughing happily. The old revolutionary patted him, trying to convey something, but [Zhang Side] didn't understand.
0:28:9|0:28:17|He gestured again, but [Zhang Side] still didn't catch on. So the old revolutionary picked up the chalk he was using to make clothes and drew on the wall, calling him over to take a look.
0:28:18|0:28:31|The old revolutionary was seen drawing with a serious expression, stroke by stroke. After finishing the drawing, he put the chalk in his pocket and then explained the meaning of the drawing to [Zhang Side]. He pointed to the wall with his finger, then to his own heart, and finally stomped his foot while speaking forcefully.
0:28:31|0:28:42|[Zhang Side] understood his meaning. He smiled slightly, pondered for a moment, then grabbed a stool and a stone to start drawing. He drew a big circle, and the old revolutionary patted his chest to indicate that it represented himself.
0:28:43|0:28:53|[Zhang Side] then wrote the three characters "Yan Anjia" in the circle, the old revolutionary nodded and raised his thumb. [Zhang Side] gestured for him to continue reading down, and then he wrote the word "son".
0:28:53|0:29:7|The old revolutionary looked puzzled when he saw [Zhang Side], who had been taking care of him all along. He had a vague answer in his mind, but he dared not confirm it. After all, he was already old, and the troops had repeatedly advised him to retire. Besides, he couldn't speak for himself.
0:29:7|0:29:14|He really couldn't figure out why [Zhang Side] would want to be his son. He pointed to the two characters anxiously, looking hopefully at [Zhang Side].
0:29:25|0:29:40|The old revolutionary repeated the words in disbelief. After receiving confirmation from [Zhang Side], he put down the fabric in his hand, stood up excitedly, and grabbed him. Still unable to believe it, [Zhang Side] pressed on with a firm tone. The old revolutionary was momentarily overwhelmed with joy.
0:29:40|0:29:44|He thought for a moment, then walked quietly to the head of the bed. When he came back, he carefully held a handful of red dates in his hands.
0:29:45|0:29:58|[Zhang Side] stood still, not knowing what was going on. The old revolutionary reminded him to catch it, then put the red date in his hand and fed another one into his mouth. Seeing him eat it, the old revolutionary clapped happily, encouraged Side by patting his shoulder, and then hurriedly left.
0:29:58|0:30:15|[Zhang Side] looked at the red dates in his hand, all saved by the old revolutionary and now given to him just because he was his son. Tears welled up in his eyes. Slowly, [Zhang Side] raised his head with a determined look, he must treat the old revolutionary better.
0:30:16|0:30:30|As time passed day by day, in the days without tasks, [Zhang Side] was still busy. He would occasionally visit the kindergarten to see his godson Song Guangming. Not only that, he also found time to bathe the horse, give the squad leader a haircut, and even play the harmonica to cultivate his sentiment.
0:30:30|0:30:47|Song Guangming became more cheerful with his company, and the environment in the courtyard was also kept very clean by him. In his spare time, he would pick up a bundle of straw, sit in the field, and weave straw shoes for his comrades. Even when his clothes were soaked with sweat, he didn't stop. The large chorus of the troops continued, and [Zhang Side] was still full of energy.
0:30:47|0:30:52|In daily training, [Zhang Side] always takes the lead and charges ahead, making his days very fulfilling.
0:31:32|0:31:45|On the basketball court, everyone is playing a game, with people chasing each other and trying to block each other with outstretched arms.
0:31:45|0:31:59|As the opponent approached the basket for a quick layup, Zhang Side made a powerful block to intercept the ball, then passed it to Xiao Bai. Xiao Bai passed it to Mao Zedong, but Mao Zedong stopped in the middle of the court with the ball in his hands, took a shot, but missed the opportunity as the ball did not go in.
0:32:5|0:32:15|[Zhang Side] wiped the sweat off his forehead, sneakily climbed over the wall, and ran to fetch the ball. The others ran over to watch on the side, but he ran far and still couldn't find the ball. Da Li couldn't bear it anymore and blamed Xiao Bai.
0:32:32|0:32:34|[Zhang Side] ran out to help Aunt Guan chase the pig.
0:32:55|0:33:11|The pig ran into the river, and [Zhang Side] followed, exerting great effort to finally catch the pig. At the same time, Liu Bingzhong came out of the small shop, but his hands were tied with a rope, followed by two soldiers. He looked serious and distressed.
0:33:11|0:33:21|He walked forward with a limp, deliberately distancing himself from two people, not wanting the passersby to notice. [Zhang Side] was carrying a pig to take it home, and as he passed by, he saw [Liu Bingzhong].
0:33:52|0:34:12|Without waiting for [Liu Bingzhong] to answer, he was urged to hurry up. [Zhang Side] felt something was wrong and hurriedly stopped him. As [Liu Bingzhong] walked further away, [Zhang Side] anxiously handed the porridge to an old man. Without time to explain, [Zhang Side] quickly ran forward, trying to take a shortcut in the alley to catch up with [Liu Bingzhong].
0:34:12|0:34:18|The alley twisted and turned, and [Zhang Side] finally caught up after much effort, panting and anxiously asking questions.
0:35:42|0:35:58|[Liu Bingzhong] said with a sob to [Zhang Side]. After saying that, he turned around and left without looking back. [Zhang Side] was in a daze after hearing this, he looked at [Liu Bingzhong], still unable to believe that he would do such a thing. He walked to the wall like a zombie and slowly slid down to the ground.
0:35:58|0:36:10|As the sky darkened, the squad leader walked past the stables with a bamboo basket. He took a look inside and saw [Zhang Side] rubbing the horse's belly. He dropped the bamboo basket and walked in, calling out tentatively.
0:36:25|0:36:45|[Zhang Side] didn't know how to answer, he quickened the movements of his subordinates to conceal his sadness. The squad leader walked up to him, squatted down beside him, and asked again. [Zhang Side] slowed down his movements, leaned on the horse to stand up, took a few steps forward, tears already streaming down his face. He wiped away the tears with his sleeve, and the day's pent-up emotions finally broke through.
0:36:45|0:36:48|He tried to speak several times, but tears choked him and he couldn't say a word.
0:37:13|0:37:16|He turned around and finally squatted down helplessly, holding the horse and crying bitterly.
0:37:23|0:37:37|The squad leader saw him in such great pain, walked over slowly, patting his back to comfort him. [Zhang Side] cried even harder, as if wanting to release all the negative emotions. One day, [Zhang Side] was identifying herbs with the Chairman.
0:37:56|0:38:7|The Chairman put down the magnifying glass, wanting to smoke, but the cigarette box was empty. He had to give up and stood up to walk around. The Chairman picked up the cigarette on the table, and [Zhang Side] opened the lighter smoothly.
0:39:25|0:39:29|The Chairman handed the water cup to [Zhang Side], his face serious as he pondered.
0:40:9|0:40:17|[Zhang Side] still couldn't think of any of his own merits. Seeing him so troubled, Chairman Mao didn't press further and handed him a letter.
0:40:44|0:41:1|After receiving the mission, [Zhang Side] immediately set off. He ran all the way, not even stopping when encountering rivers. His steps were swift as if he had motors under his feet. After running a distance, he felt a bit tired and rested by walking quickly, but soon started running again. His only thought was to complete the task assigned by Chairman Mao as quickly as possible.
0:41:3|0:41:9|The distance between the two places was not close, but [Zhang Side] arrived at the doorstep of the Liberation Army Daily soon due to his fast speed.
0:41:15|0:41:20|[Zhang Side] delivered the letter on time, and the newspaper staff quickly turned its contents into a newspaper.
0:41:21|0:41:36|Zhu De's speeches, Chairman Mao's speeches at the Yan'an Forum, and a series of initiatives and documents were all printed, greatly boosting morale in the later stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan. At night, everyone gathered to watch a movie.
0:41:55|0:42:6|The squad leader walked over, taking over the engine shaking from [Zhang Side]. [Zhang Side] picked up the cup and drank it all, happily ran to watch the movie. When there was no seat available, he squeezed to watch by the door, watching with great enthusiasm.
0:42:6|0:42:18|The interpreter held the microphone, translating word by word, staring at the screen intently, afraid of missing a single sentence. The audience watched very attentively, everyone treasured this hard-won entertainment activity. Zhang Side was also there, sitting on Qiu Yuemei's lap, behaving very obediently.
0:42:22|0:42:35|The audience was all laughing at the plot of the movie. However, at this moment, someone in the film pulled out a gun and started shooting wildly. Zhang Side's face changed drastically, covering his ears and bursting into tears.
0:43:22|0:43:33|In the blink of an eye, winter has arrived. Two lines of people holding flowers are seen walking towards the venue in an orderly manner. Inside the venue, many people have gathered, applauding enthusiastically, ready to listen to the speech by [Mao Zedong].
0:43:59|0:44:6|After the speech, the banquet officially began, with a lively and bustling atmosphere. [Mao Zedong] stepped down from the stage, holding a wine glass to celebrate with everyone.
0:44:12|0:44:25|[Zhang Side] was washing a car outside the door at this time, when the squad leader ran out of the venue to find him. The squad leader threw away the cloth in his hand, pulled him towards the venue, not giving him any room to refuse.
0:45:1|0:45:6|[Zhang Side] drank too much alcohol for Chairman Mao and was supported by comrades back to the camp.
0:45:27|0:45:36|Xiao Bai and Dalijia rode on with [Zhang Side]. [Zhang Side] was unsteady, almost stumbling even with someone supporting him. The squad leader couldn't help but ask.
0:45:48|0:46:5|As a result, [Zhang Side] vomited all over the squad leader. The next morning, sobering up from the alcohol, [Zhang Side] arrived at the Lu Xun Lanfeng Literature Institute. This three-story building with a large pointed roof design exuded a strong artistic atmosphere. Walking through the entrance, [Zhang Side] entered the classroom, only to be stunned by the scene before his eyes.
0:46:5|0:46:14|In the art classroom, a model in military uniform with two braids stood on the stage. Below the stage, painters sketched his appearance stroke by stroke. Further inside was the dance classroom.
0:46:15|0:46:29|The girls hold onto the handrails, practicing their basic skills with graceful and coordinated movements. [Zhang Side] feels a bit awkward, subconsciously adjusting his clothes. In the music classroom, the orchestra is rehearsing, with someone playing the erhu, someone playing the pipa, and others playing the violin.
0:46:29|0:46:47|The variety of musical instruments, blending Eastern and Western styles, left [Zhang Side] unsure where to look. At that moment, the choir started singing, their harmonious voices soothing to the ears. The song "We Are Red Soldiers," performed by them, stirred up strong emotions and passion. Everyone paired up to dance a social dance, creating a warm and cozy atmosphere.
0:46:47|0:47:1|Although they have different jobs, everyone is very dedicated. They rehearse diligently, hoping that their performances can help relieve the soldiers' stress. In the courtyard, [Mao Zedong] is ringing the bell to end work, ultimately following the arrangement of the troops and retiring to this place.
0:47:1|0:47:12|[Zhang Side] quietly approached him from behind, covering his eyes. [Mao Zedong] turned around and was very happy to see him. [Mao Zedong] took [Zhang Side] by the hand and walked towards the dormitory.
0:47:15|0:47:30|[Mao Zedong] was dressed in a new thick cotton coat, the fatigue in his eyes swept away. Without needing to ask, it was clear that he was doing well. In the dormitory, [Zhang Side] was tidying up in the kitchen, while [Mao Zedong] was sewing, and at some point, he leaned back against the bed and closed his eyes.
0:47:30|0:47:44|Beside him were all kinds of snacks laid out. [Zhang Side] flicked off the dust on his hand and sat down at the edge of the bed, casually picked up a red date and put it in his mouth. Seeing [Mao Zedong]'s eyes drooping, he leaned in to gently support him. Startled by this gesture, [Mao Zedong] woke up, and the two of them smiled at each other.
0:47:49|0:48:2|After returning from the literary college, [Zhang Side] immediately went to stand guard without stopping. The heavy snow fell like goose feathers, but [Zhang Side] did not slack off at all. Late at night, the squad leader came to change shifts, and he walked towards [Zhang Side] with his head held high, standing in front of him.
0:48:11|0:48:23|[Zhang Side] quietly entered the Chairman's room carrying a charcoal bucket, only to find the desk piled with documents. The Chairman was writing an article at the moment. [Zhang Side] carefully closed the door and walked towards the stove, adding more charcoal inside.
0:50:7|0:50:24|After getting off work in the morning, [Zhang Side] walked briskly on the road. In the alley, a group of children were playing. The sound of firecrackers was continuous, and the atmosphere of the New Year became stronger. [Zhang Side] arrived at the prison. Along the way, his lips turned white from the cold, and his fingers were numb.
0:50:24|0:50:29|Taking advantage of the guard opening the door, he yawned into his hand, while his eyes scanned the area back and forth.
0:51:38|0:51:53|Liu Bingzhong, disheveled and shabby, looked dejected. [Zhang Side] couldn't bear to see him like this, so after coming out of prison, he decided to help him. He went to the factory where Geng Yuqiu worked, handed his pass to the guard, and quickly walked inside.
0:51:53|0:51:59|In the factory, everyone is busy. Zhang Side finds the factory manager and asks about Geng Yuqiu's situation.
0:52:18|0:52:29|He remained silent, often accompanying [Mao Zedong] to his workspace. He had just returned from moving several large boxes and was now loading explosives into grenades. He was meticulous, unaffected by those around him.
0:52:36|0:52:48|The two of them came to the courtyard, with [Mao Zedong] standing with his head down on one side, his fingers nervously twisting together. [Zhang Side] was also a bit nervous, constantly adjusting his sleeves, unable to say a word for a long time, and the two stood facing each other at the main entrance.
0:53:46|0:53:48|Zhang Side was the first one to stand up.
0:54:4|0:54:9|[Mao Zedong] ran away crying after saying this, leaving [Zhang Side] standing there at a loss.
0:55:4|0:55:6|The front show of the Front Sky Team is playing.
0:55:48|0:56:4|[Zhang Side] was preparing to exchange performances with Qiu Lemei, but when he turned his head, she was not there. He looked out the window and saw her on a date with Wang Changling. [Zhang Side] wanted to take another look, but at that moment the performance ended. He turned back and clapped, seeing Guangming Residence completed, then happily ran towards [Zhang Side] through the crowd.
0:56:13|0:56:24|[Zhang Side] placed Song Guangming on his lap, took out the chocolate given by [Mao Zedong] from his pocket, and fed it to the child. Outside the window, Qiu Yuemei and another person embraced and kissed, [Zhang Side] quickly covered Song Guangming's eyes.
0:56:24|0:56:30|At this moment, other children gathered around, leaning on the windowsill, sharing the happiness of Teacher Qiu.
0:56:31|0:56:46|After the Spring Festival, Li Dingming came to Yan'an to attend a symposium. Chairman Mao was very happy to see his close friend and presented a plaque named "Old Star" to expand production. The soldiers began to learn how to operate spinning wheels, sitting on the ground in the courtyard, each with a machine, learning in an orderly manner.
0:56:46|0:56:59|The snow and ice melted, and it was spring again. New buds sprouted on the big tree in front of the barracks. By the riverbank, people formed several large circles to play games together. [Zhang Side] and his classmates continued to practice singing, with Xiao Bai conducting in front, very disciplined and orderly.
0:56:59|0:57:16|Qiu Yuemei and several female teachers gathered together, chatting and laughing, discussing hairstyles in front of the mirror. The kindergarten children were performing on stage, with Zhang Side standing in the middle looking much more cheerful than last year. The Liberation Daily was preparing to take photos of Chairman Mao Zedong, who was sitting on a rattan chair holding a newspaper, with a very kind smile on his face.
0:57:16|0:57:30|Wang Changling came back from outside, the horse was not even tied up, and he went to find Qiu Yuemei. Qiu Yuemei ran out, with a shy face, the activities in the army were rich, and the day of the choir performance arrived. [Zhang Side] moved from the last row to the first row, but his mouth was still the widest open.
0:57:30|0:57:47|In the wrestling match, pairs of [Zhang Side] and his partner showed great coordination and won the victory. In the tug-of-war competition, the two teams were evenly matched for a long time until [Zhang Side] exerted all his strength and led his team to victory in an instant. After the competition, everyone sat around weaving straw shoes. [Zhang Side] patiently guided his less skilled comrades.
0:57:47|0:58:4|During daily training, the soldiers were all very serious, each one striving to be the first and fearing to fall behind others. In the blink of an eye, the harvest season arrived, and everyone's faces were filled with the joy of a bountiful harvest. [Zhang Side] and his comrades went to the fields to sell the harvest, the sun shining down on them causing sweat to pour down their backs, but everyone was extremely happy.
0:58:4|0:58:8|Chairman Mao Zedong rubbed off the microphone and saw the strict and full of selling people inside, and a smile bloomed.
0:58:9|0:58:19|In mid-June, with the situation in the northwest becoming critical, over 40,000 soldiers and civilians from Yan'an packed their bags and set off to provide support. After the battle, everyone gathered around to listen to [Wang Changling] tell stories.
0:58:34|0:58:40|At the same time, [Zhang Side] is running frantically in the pouring rain. He is not carrying an umbrella, just draped in a large plastic sheet.
0:58:54|0:59:10|The room was filled with joy and laughter, everyone was laughing heartily. [Zhang Side] was walking through a muddy area at this time, which was already slippery and downhill. He carefully made his way down and finally reached the barracks safely. Afraid of getting his clothes dirty, [Zhang Side] ran barefoot all the way, and finally arrived at the barracks with his clothes completely soaked.
0:59:10|0:59:12|He walked into the room, where everyone was packing up.
0:59:38|0:59:42|[Zhang Side] was at a loss for a moment, and [Wang Changling] also looked regretful.
1:0:26|1:0:34|[Wang Changling] saluted everyone and then hurriedly left. [Zhang Side] couldn't calm down for a long time and slowly walked towards the kang.
1:0:35|1:0:52|Everyone remained silent, their faces filled with anger. Luckily, Wang Changling hadn't gone far yet, and [Zhang Side] caught up with him in a few steps. He took Wang Changling straight to the Chairman's office, hoping to try his luck again. Of course, he hoped he could return safely, but on the battlefield, swords have no eyes, and [Zhang Side] dared not gamble.
1:0:52|1:1:10|He was afraid that Wang Changling would really sacrifice himself and never have the chance again, but he was willing. Seeing no response, [Zhang Side] lifted the curtain and looked inside. Wang Changling looked firmly at the cave, raised his right arm on his neck, and slowly saluted.
1:1:10|1:1:17|[Zhang Side] wiped the rain off his face and looked at the captain standing in the rain as if it were nothing. His eyes were full of admiration for Chairman Mao.
1:1:24|1:1:33|Although he didn't meet Chairman Mao in person, Wang Changling was already satisfied. He warmly thanked [Zhang Side], who felt a bit embarrassed and thought he didn't deserve such gratitude.
1:1:33|1:1:48|Just back from Qingliang Mountain, Chairman is about to set off again, never stopping for a moment. Although [Mao Zedong] could sit in the car, he preferred to stand on the rear footboard. As the car passed over the bridge, three soldiers were using camels to transport food, and the sound of the camel bells was very pleasant to the ears.
1:1:48|1:2:6|Vehicles arrived at the market, where it was bustling with people. The common folks leisurely strolled around, weaving in and out of small vendors, looking to purchase the most cost-effective goods. On the gate of the market, slogans were posted about driving the Japanese invaders out of the country. The victory in the War of Resistance against Japan was just a year away, and the people's lives were becoming more comfortable.
1:2:8|1:2:32|Chairman's car drove through the crowd, but suddenly swayed from side to side and stopped. The soldiers quickly got off the car to check. The Chairman got off the car, walked to the deflated tire, sighed as he looked at the unreliable car. He took out his watch, saw that the time was approaching, and his expression became more serious.
1:2:47|1:3:2|[Zhang Side], [Zhang Side] quickly immersed himself in repairing cars, while Chairman Mao strolled around the market, feeling more and more relaxed as he saw the lively scene on the street. He walked up to a stall selling pumpkins, casually picked one up, and found that the pumpkins were all plump and in excellent condition.
1:4:19|1:4:24|Xiao Bai took out money and handed it to Lao Bo. Seeing this, Lao Bo then added a lot of red dates into the scale.
1:4:32|1:4:39|The old man poured red dates into a cloth bag, and Xiao Bai picked it up and left. At this moment, a passerby recognized [Mao Zedong].
1:4:48|1:5:5|After some twists and turns, [Mao Zedong] finally arrived at the meeting venue. After shaking hands with Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and others, [Mao Zedong] walked to the front of the stage, greeted the residents below warmly and said hello.
1:5:5|1:5:13|The car was finally fixed. After putting the tools back in the trunk, [Zhang Side] picked up his hat and was about to get in the car. However, as soon as he opened the door, he heard the sound of the tire leaking air again.
1:5:57|1:6:6|At the same time, the meeting has already started. He must get the tire and fix the car before the chairman finishes the meeting. Even on the bumpy sand, he doesn't slow down.
1:6:44|1:6:53|[Zhang Side] has arrived at the bridge and will be there soon. Both of his shoes have disappeared, and he has been running barefoot for most of the way.
1:7:20|1:7:34|He finally arrived at the entrance of the market. When the squad leader saw him coming, he quickly took off the tire to repair the car. As the tire was removed, he almost fell to the ground. [Zhang Side] was so exhausted that he couldn't stand up straight, using the last of his strength to walk to the side of the car and lean against it to rest. His gaze was unfocused, breathing heavily.
1:8:36|1:8:52|At the end of the speech, there was enthusiastic applause in the room, and [Mao Zedong]'s words deeply resonated with everyone. After the meeting, [Mao Zedong] and a group of people walked out of the conference room. The car had been repaired and was safely parked in front of [Mao Zedong].
1:8:57|1:9:0|[Zhang Side] embarrassed himself and tried to hide his feet.
1:9:5|1:9:19|Chairman Mao sat in the car, with [Zhang Side] returning to the back footboard. The car slowly drove away, and this time there were no more accidents. Back at the camp, [Zhang Side] was still thinking about Liu Bingzhong, so he came to find Geng Yuqiu again. Although they didn't settle things last time, he still wanted to give it another try.
1:9:19|1:9:26|This time he did not go directly, but through the factory director. He stood in front of the honor roll waiting and watching. After a long time, the factory director came out alone.
1:10:2|1:10:7|Geng Yuqiu was already in tears on top of the cabinet, not knowing what to do at the moment.
1:10:24|1:10:44|[Zhang Side] lowered his head, dare not meet the eyes of Liu Bingzhong. Liu Bingzhong fell silent for a moment, unable to speak the words that were on the tip of his tongue. He slowly looked down at the railing outside, paused, took a deep breath, and slowly spoke. [Zhang Side] paused his movements, wanting to say something, but found himself unable to speak. Liu Bingzhong lowered his head.
1:10:44|1:10:47|[Zhang Side] lied for the first time, hesitated for a long time and couldn't say a word.
1:11:51|1:11:59|[Zhang Side] looked incredulous, with a face full of shock as he gazed at Liu Bingzhong. After the surprise, a glimmer of hope ignited within him, and he stood up and walked to his side.
1:12:22|1:12:28|Liu Bing choked with emotion, suddenly stood up and walked to the side. Zhang Side tried to support him, but was pushed away by him.
1:12:44|1:13:11|Seeing Liu Bingzhong full of fighting spirit again, [Zhang Side] was overjoyed and tears welled up in his eyes. He wanted to say something but instead hugged his old comrade directly, blending his words into the embrace. Glancing around, [Zhang Side] lowered his voice and comforted him once again.
1:13:22|1:13:43|Saying goodbye to Liu Bingzhong, [Zhang Side] hurries to see Song Guangming. The two sit outside the hospital chatting. Inside the ward, the [doctor] picks up an umbrella with a serious expression, getting ready to leave, while [Zhou Yuemei] rushes in.
1:13:46|1:13:51|[Zhou Yuemei] slowly walked to the bedside, tears uncontrollably streaming down her cheeks.
1:14:6|1:14:14|[Zhou Yuemei] tremblingly took Wang Changling's hand, which had been beaten to a pulp, his eyes unfocused and his face covered in bandages.
1:14:35|1:14:48|[Zhang Side] didn't know how to explain to him. At this moment, [Qiu Yuemei] opened the curtain and walked out, leaning against the door frame with tears streaming down her face. [Zhang Side] felt something was wrong, stood up, and stared at her with a blank expression. Overwhelmed with sadness, [Qiu Yuemei] ran out of the hospital room.
1:14:54|1:15:6|Tears mixed with rain flowed down, [Qiu Yuemei] furrowed her brows, tears gushing like a spring. [Zhang Side] walked slowly towards him, but hesitated to ask about Wang Changlin. Sensing his approach, [Qiu Yuemei] slowly turned around, and [Zhang Side] asked softly.
1:16:43|1:16:54|It was already night, [Mao Zedong] arrived at the field hospital. He walked hurriedly, almost wanting to run into the gate. The doctors and nurses were already waiting at the entrance, ready to report to him. They hurriedly walked towards [Wang Changling]'s ward.
1:17:6|1:17:14|Qiu Yuemei was very fortunate that [Mao Zedong] could come. His eyes were full of light, as if grasping a life-saving straw. [Mao Zedong] took off his hat and walked towards [Wang Changlin].
1:17:28|1:17:42|[Mao Zedong] looked heartbroken. At this moment, [Wang Changling] moved his eyes slightly and slowly opened them. Everyone looked at him in surprise. [Wang Changling] moved his lips slightly, as if saying something, but he was too weak for anyone to hear clearly.
1:17:42|1:17:49|[Mao Zedong] bent down and placed his ear near [Zhang Side]'s mouth, but still couldn't hear clearly, so he asked him to repeat it again.
1:19:55|1:20:3|[Wang Changling] sacrificed like this, without even finishing his last sentence. [Mao Zedong] gently placed his hand back on the bed.
1:20:19|1:20:30|Chairman Mao Zedong stood quietly by the bed, looking at this brave soldier. He let out a heavy sigh, walked to a place facing away from everyone to wipe away his tears. His face was full of sorrow and pain, another soldier sacrificed in the war.
1:20:34|1:20:42|Chairman Mao Zedong looked out of the window at the pouring rain, his face full of certainty. His gaze was firm, as if he had known the outcome all along.
1:20:46|1:21:3|Outside the ward, [Zhang Side] plays in the rain. Although Wang Changling sacrificed himself, his spirit lives on. This generation will grow up listening to his stories, continuing to build China in their place. It is because of people like him, who are not afraid of sacrifice, that these children can grow up carefree.
1:21:26|1:21:34|Shortly afterwards, they arrived at their destination. At this moment, [Zhang Side] and his companions were cutting down trees in the woods. He was wearing a large vest, with sweat already soaking through his clothes.
1:21:41|1:21:53|Zhang Side cut the tree trunk into evenly sized wooden sections for making a kiln. He walked back and forth, checking the situation at the cave entrance. After finishing these tasks, he went to cook. The next day, all the cave entrances were completely drilled, and they were about to start the fire.
1:22:2|1:22:8|Above the cave, white smoke rose slowly as several openings were lit simultaneously, showing a very high efficiency. The smoke dissipated.
1:22:23|1:22:30|[Zhang Side] ran from the top of the mountain to the bottom, personally inspecting every cave entrance. Xiao Bai was choked by the thick smoke and coughed uncontrollably, running out to catch his breath.
1:22:46|1:22:56|A fire suddenly broke out at a cave entrance, and [Zhang Side] and everyone rushed up quickly. Upon hearing Dali's call, Xiaobai stood up leisurely, showing no intention of going to help.
1:23:2|1:23:19|This day, just finished working, [Mao Zedong] put down the shovel and straw hat, ready to take a break and have a drink of water. But as soon as he picked up the water kettle, he noticed something wrong with the nearby hole. He quickly put down the cup, walked over to check. He leaned close to the hole, hearing the sound of burning inside. He hurriedly looked up at the top of the hole.
1:23:34|1:23:51|The flames were extinguished by several buckets of water, and the charcoal that everyone had worked hard to burn for days was destroyed in an instant. The soldiers sat on the ground, each one dejected, even [Zhang Side] was physically and mentally exhausted. This charcoal kiln had cost him a lot of effort, and now he was more upset than anyone else. At this moment, the sound of a harmonica came, and everyone listened in a daze.
1:23:51|1:24:8|Zhang Side stood up angrily and followed the voice to find Xiao Bai. Seeing him not responding, [Zhang Side] quickly caught up. Xiao Bai was sitting by the lake at this time, leisurely playing the harmonica. Zhang Side walked up to him with great anger. Xiao Bai stopped playing when he saw him, looking at him puzzled.
1:24:33|1:24:40|[Zhang Side] and Dali locked eyes for a moment, both looking incredulous. He took Xiao Bai's harmonica and patiently explained things to her.
1:24:51|1:24:57|Seeing Xiaobai being so stubborn, [Zhang Side] was so angry that he took a deep breath and threw the harmonica into the pot.
1:25:3|1:25:20|After speaking, [Zhang Side] turned and left. Dali, feeling unresolved, glared fiercely at Xiaobai before also turning away. Tears welled up in Xiaobai's eyes. [Zhang Side] returned to the cave, picked up a shovel, and ruthlessly chopped off all the branches blocking the entrance, as if trying to vent all his anger.
1:25:20|1:25:27|Even though Xiaobai was so unreasonable, after calming down, [Zhang Side] still spoke kindly to her and personally brought the meal into the house.
1:25:29|1:25:31|Xiao Bai lay on the bed ignoring him.
1:25:34|1:25:57|Seeing Xiaobai still ignoring himself, [Zhang Side] wanted to say something, but feeling guilty, he just silently placed the meal on the table and left. After lunch, everyone cleaned up the abandoned charcoal fire together. [Zhang Side] was worried about Xiaobai, and his mind was not focused on the work. [Zhang Side] couldn't help but show a blue expression on his face.
1:26:5|1:26:19|Zhang Side walked away dejectedly. [Zhang Side] came to the pond where the dispute had occurred that day, jumped into the water to find the discarded harmonica. He was very careful, afraid of missing a spot, repeatedly diving three or four times, and finally found the harmonica.
1:26:19|1:26:27|He finally smiled, [Zhang Side] didn't even have time to put on his clothes before hurriedly looking for Xiaobai, his body was wet, unable to distinguish whether it was water or sweat.
1:26:28|1:26:43|[Zhang Side] looked around the room and didn't see anyone. Looking at the bed, there was only a straw mat and a few blankets left, everything else was gone. Seeing this, [Zhang Side] panicked and quickly ran out to search. He climbed up a small hill and finally saw Little Bai walking far ahead.
1:26:43|1:26:45|He hadn't even caught his breath, and he shouted anxiously:
1:27:4|1:27:9|Seeing Xiaobai walking further and further away, [Zhang Side] took a shortcut and hid directly in front of him.
1:27:28|1:27:50|Xiao Bai stopped to look at [Zhang Side], then tried to move forward again, but didn't go far before stopping. Unexpectedly, Xiao Bai seemed determined to leave, prompting [Zhang Side] to persuade him once more. Xiao Bai turned around, and [Zhang Side] held up the harmonica to him. Seeing the harmonica, a hint of surprise flashed in Xiao Bai's eyes, and his expression softened slightly.
1:27:59|1:28:8|Xiao Bai broke down emotionally, he did not take the harmonica and walked to the side crying. [Zhang Side] saw him like this, feeling even more guilty in his heart.
1:28:54|1:29:0|Dozens of eyes stared straight at Xiaobai, who lowered his head guiltily. [Zhang Side] quickly stepped in to defuse the situation.
1:29:17|1:29:22|Everyone became interested and looked at [Zhang Side] with curiosity on their faces.
1:30:12|1:30:25|[Zhang Side] solemnly instructed Xiao Bai and quickly ran to investigate. Xiao Bai sat quietly at the table, tears welling up in his eyes. He finally realized his mistake, realized how absurd he had been before, and regretted deeply for a moment.
1:30:25|1:30:38|Early the next morning, the entire charcoal-burning team gathered, full of energy, ready to resume their work of moving wooden barrels. After realizing his mistake, Xiaobai was full of determination. Seeing Xiaobai turn over a new leaf, [Zhang Side] was overjoyed.
1:30:39|1:30:56|At this moment, the team is walking in the dense forest, each person carrying a large basket half a meter high on their back. The path is steep, and they proceed with caution. Xiao Bai sits on the ground, frantically drinking water, and [Zhang Side] quickly walks over to inquire.
1:30:59|1:31:12|This firm answer amused [Zhang Side], who picked up Xiao Bai's luggage and prepared to move forward. Xiao Bai wanted to stop him, but [Zhang Side] didn't give him a chance at all. Xiao Bai looked at his back and made up his mind to become a person like him, not afraid of hardship.
1:31:12|1:31:25|He averted his gaze, shouldered the water bottle with the good stuff, and continued on his way. He didn't want to let down Zhang Side's help. Fortunately, Xiao Bai and the main force hadn't fallen too far behind, and soon caught up. The squad walked along the rugged mountain road from day to sunset.
1:31:25|1:31:34|After a day of running around, Zhang Side finally started to head back, the basket on his back becoming noticeably heavier. After returning from the mountain, everyone immediately reopened the tunnel entrance.
1:32:1|1:32:20|Xiaobai took the initiative to make up for the previous mistake by actively taking on the task of digging the hole. [Zhang Side] came down to inspect and handed him the watering can. Only then did Xiaobai come down from the ladder, but his eyes were fixed on above.
1:32:25|1:32:44|Xiao Bai helped [Zhang Side] down the ladder, handed him a cup of water, and then climbed back up to work busily. [Zhang Side] didn't expect him to be so proactive. After bathing by the pond, everyone gathered together to have a meal.
1:33:22|1:33:29|[Zhang Side] lay leisurely on the bed. While everyone else was discussing something fervently, [Zhang Side] gazed at the round moon above, lost in thought.
1:33:51|1:34:6|At this moment, he took off his backpack, took out the shoes given to him by [Mao Zedong], and put them on vigorously.
1:34:48|1:35:4|Inside the room, bursts of laughter could be heard from time to time, everyone was enjoying this rare leisure time. Outside, a gentle breeze was blowing, while the summer insects were chirping. In the early morning, a heavy rain poured down from the sky, the thatched roof couldn't withstand the water's force, causing leaks. A few drops of rain fell on the sleeping Zhang Side's feet.
1:35:4|1:35:16|He intended to change his position and squint for a while, but felt something was wrong in his heart, so he sat up to check. He looked sleepily at the roof, turned his head and found that [Zhang Side] and Xiaobai's beds were empty. He quickly woke up his comrade next to him, put on his clothes and got out of bed.
1:35:28|1:35:43|[Zhang Side] is now running wildly with two bundles of straw mats towards the big shed where the charcoal is stored. The muddy ground mixed with rainwater makes his feet slip, and he throws the straw mats onto the shed roof. However, he exerts too much force and ends up throwing himself out, falling heavily to the ground.
1:35:43|1:35:53|He didn't care about the rattan, quickly climbed up the ladder, spread the straw mat evenly to prevent water leakage from the top, and coal from getting damp. After finishing these tasks, he hurriedly ran to the entrance of Little White's hole.
1:36:44|1:36:50|[Zhang Side] heard the pleasant music, which made him work with even more vigor. At the same time, Mao Zedong and his group hurriedly rushed to this place.
1:36:50|1:37:7|In the pouring rain, the charcoal kiln was hidden in the curtain of rain, like a water curtain cave. Suddenly, several pieces of rubble fell vertically from the top of the mountain. Xiao Bai and [Zhang Side] were immersed in the music, and no one noticed. The torrential rain carried the mud, sand, and rocks on the charcoal kiln rushing down like a mudslide.
1:37:7|1:37:17|Xiao Bai and [Zhang Side] are in the cave, completely unaware of the impending danger, still happily working. Only the swaying water kettle, shaken by the vibrations, foresees the arrival of this disaster.
1:37:17|1:37:26|They were climbing up the hill in Dali when suddenly there was a loud noise not far away. They hurried forward a few steps, only to see the collapse of the cave entrance of [Zhang Side] and Xiaobai.
1:37:38|1:37:52|The sweat-soaked soil and sand were washed away by the heavy rain, and the trees on the mountain also rolled down. The speed was too fast, and [Zhang Side] didn't have time to run out. On September 5, 1994, [Zhang Side] hastily ended his life in the Sheshan Gorge area of ​​An'sai, Shaanxi.
1:37:52|1:37:58|The heavy rain continued to pour down, as if a huge pearl curtain was hung between the sky and the earth, shrouding everything in mist.
1:37:59|1:38:17|The surroundings were quiet, only the sound of rain could be heard. Everyone was immersed in the news of [Zhang Side]'s sacrifice and couldn't break free. The raindrops formed into lines, falling vertically along the tiles, giving a sense of loneliness. The raindrops slanted onto the accumulated water on the ground, creating ripples. Inside the room, the Chairman sat quietly on a rattan chair.
1:38:43|1:39:11|He smiles like a child. Just feel that he is still a child. He is the best soldier in the guard team. With both parents gone, Chairman hesitated for a moment, tears welling up in his eyes, his face full of tenderness towards [Zhang Side].
1:39:40|1:39:47|Captain Gu handed the phone to the Chairman, who put down the brush fan and took the phone with a serious expression.
1:40:22|1:40:36|Captain Gu [Geng Yezhu] took a long time to agree. After Captain Gu left, Chairman Mao sat motionless at his desk, unable to help but recall every detail with Zhang Side, his expression becoming more and more sorrowful and regretful. He regretted not getting to know him better.
1:40:36|1:40:50|At the same time, Zhang Side is working in the yard. He has been released from prison and is starting a new life. Feng Yuqiu finally reconciles with Zhang Side, and when Zhang Side sees him coming, he quickly goes out to find him.
1:40:52|1:41:12|[Geng Yuqiu] hadn't finished speaking when tears started to fall. Passing the question to [Qiu Yuemei], she looked at the innocent child in front of her, thinking about how to explain.
1:41:20|1:41:29|[Qiu Yuemei] didn't want Song Guangming to experience the pain of losing loved ones again, so she decided to create a fairy tale for him. He spoke again, with a firm tone.
1:41:29|1:41:41|[Qiu Yuemei] hugged Song Guangming in her arms, and [Zhang Side]'s sacrifice reminded him of Wang Changling again. Although these words were meant to comfort Song Guangming, they were also comforting himself. They were just asleep, as their spirits will always exist in the world.
1:41:44|1:41:57|[Zhang Side] lies on the bed, with the brand new military uniform and a pair of straw shoes sent by Chairman Mao placed on it. Xiaobai puts a bouquet of flowers and a harmonica beside them. He tries hard to suppress his crying, but his trembling body still betrays him.
1:41:57|1:42:12|After putting down the things, he quickly walked out of the room, where there were too many memories about Zhang Side that he dared not recall. Zhang Side bought a copy of "The Constitution of the Communist Party of China" and a pen, while Mao Zedong also put down his things and left in a hurry. Everyone left their beloved items to Zhang Side.
1:42:13|1:42:19|The squad leader fumbled in the pocket on his chest and slowly opened a cloth bag, inside of which was a tobacco pipe.
1:42:19|1:42:34|[Zhang Side], who was injured in the back and dared not smoke before his death, saw the squad leader placing a pipe in front of his bed with a smug smile. He almost broke down emotionally when he got up, quickly walked out the door to prevent tears from falling here. Later, everyone returned and stood in two rows saluting towards the bed.
1:42:35|1:42:53|Everyone's face was filled with sorrow. Da Li stood alone by the bed for a long time, unwilling to see [Zhang Side] leave. The unexpected departure came so quickly that he didn't even get to see his old comrade for the last time. After everyone had left, the old revolutionary slowly entered from outside. He leaned against the wall, walking slowly and unsteadily, step by step.
1:42:53|1:43:11|He stood at the doorway, quietly gazing at his godson's bed. The death of [Zhang Side] had a profound impact on him. Within just a few months, the old revolutionary's body went from the spirited state during Chinese New Year to the feeble state it was in now. He slowly approached the bed, his palm constantly searching on the bed, trying to find the warmth of his son, but there was nothing.
1:43:11|1:43:25|He smoothed out the sheets, as gently as if he were caressing Zhang Side's head. Before Zhang Side left, he promised to see him in the winter, but that promise can no longer be fulfilled. The old revolutionary sat on the edge of the bed, suppressing his sobs.
1:43:26|1:43:41|Even so, you can still hear his sorrow. He took out two big red dates from his pocket and placed them on the bed, stacking them into a small mountain. This is the love of the old revolutionaries. [Zhang Side] loved to eat this the most. The old revolutionary picked up a date unsteadily, imitating [Zhang Side], and put the date into his mouth.
1:43:41|1:43:48|The red dates are clearly sweet, but mixed with tears, they become bitter and astringent, the old man cannot hide the pain in his heart. 
1:43:48|1:44:6|Zhou Baba's face was covered with tears, the old revolutionary took off his hat, speechless with anger. The memorial service proceeded as scheduled, a small white flower pinned to everyone's chest, the pure white flowers as simple and innocent as [Zhang Side], drawing out the image of [Zhang Side] on paper, kissing deeply, soldiers firing guns and blowing horns.
1:44:6|1:44:9|This is the highest tribute to the hero.
1:44:16|1:44:21|After the introduction of [Zhang Side]'s life, everyone stood up and Chairman Mao began to speak.
1:47:1|1:47:5|Our comrades are in a difficult situation.
1:48:10|1:48:20|Everyone was inspired by [Mao Zedong]'s words, their expressions becoming even more determined. After the memorial service ended, everyone also began to evacuate, and the venue returned to its original state, as if nothing had ever happened.
1:48:20|1:48:31|But Zhang Side's spirit has taken root in everyone's heart at this moment. There will be thousands of Zhang Sides to complete his unfinished mission for him, and he will live forever in people's hearts.
1:48:31|1:48:51|In the hearts of the people, [Zhang Side] has always been running, always busy, running in the fields, running between mountains and rivers, everyone knows. He runs for the people, busy for the motherland, with a rifle on his back as a young man, a simple smile, clear eyes. This smile will always be imprinted in everyone's heart.
