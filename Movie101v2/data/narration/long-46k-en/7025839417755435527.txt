0:7:33|0:7:44|Helpless, [Jiang Liangliang] watched as his car was smashed by the second-generation rich. The second-generation rich left satisfied, but the thugs behind him were still threatening him with a baseball bat.
0:7:45|0:8:7|After the rich second generation left, [Jiang Liangliang] pushed away his companion in anger. Helpless, [Jiang Liangliang] looked at his smashed car with heartache. When he returned home at night and closed the door, [Jiang Liangliang] did not immediately turn on the light. Instead, he leaned against the door, lost in thought. Then he turned on the light in the room, dragging his tired body slowly towards the bedroom. In a huff, he turned on the bedside lamp.
0:8:7|0:8:13|With a vacant look in her eyes, [Jiang Liangliang] takes off her jacket and slams it hard onto the bed, venting the grievances she has suffered today.
0:8:13|0:8:33|Turning around and lying on the bed, after resting for a moment, he sat on the sofa at the end of the bed, with one foot on the coffee table. He had a cigarette in his mouth and a game controller in his hand, staring blankly at the TV screen playing games. The room was filled with smoke at this moment, looking messy under the light.
0:8:33|0:9:0|The simple furniture filled the entire bedroom, while the kitchen sink reflected the fluorescent light on the pots and pans. As the alarm clock rang, welcoming a new day, [Jiang Liangliang] wrapped in a blanket, tossed and turned in bed. Suddenly, a drone above the alarm clock shot towards him, displaying the time as nine o'clock and two minutes. Weary, he reached out to grab the drone, then lifted his head to place it directly above the alarm clock.
0:9:0|0:9:28|With a strong push, the alarm clock finally quieted down. As the alarm clock stopped, the scene shifted to the set of a commercial, where a beautiful woman became the focus. She then appeared on the director's monitor, holding a drink. Following the director's command, she quickly got into character and started shooting the ice tea commercial.
0:10:2|0:10:25|The beautiful woman regained her confidence, with a stiff smile on her face, she tilted her head back and took a sip of her drink, while the staff were all focused on the display screen, watching her every move. At this moment, the whole world seemed to really quiet down. The staff in the front row were snoring, but the producer frowned, feeling it was not enough.
0:10:27|0:10:54|At this moment, everyone looked at the director, while [Jiang Liangliang] standing aside clapped his hands, and after a while, the [Jiang Liangliang] sitting in the car stared blankly and listened.
0:10:56|0:11:26|Through the rearview mirror, Jiang Liangliang saw his companion walking towards his car with a beautiful woman. His companion had a silly smile on his face as the phone rang when he closed the car door. The beautiful woman crossed over him and sat in the passenger seat, exchanging a smile with Jiang Liangliang. After his companion hung up the phone, he leaned on the car door with one hand and said,
0:11:37|0:11:50|[Jiang Liangliang] stepped on the gas pedal and drove away, leaving only Teacher Hei standing alone watching them drive off, while [Jiang Liangliang] inside the car was driving attentively, and the beauty beside him leisurely reached her hand out of the car window.
0:11:50|0:11:56|At this moment, [Jiang Liangliang] observed the beauty through the rearview mirror, hesitated to speak, and the beauty turned her head to stare at him and said,
0:11:58|0:12:5|[Jiang Liangliang], with a sudden smile on his face, stood still and exclaimed with sudden realization,
0:12:13|0:12:18|Shortly after, [Miaomiao] reached out her hand to express gratitude, and [Jiang Liangliang] also extended his hand in response after stabilizing the steering wheel.
0:12:32|0:12:38|[Miaomiao]'s teasing made [Jiang Liangliang] find it amusing, but unfortunately, [Jiang Liangliang] said,
0:12:42|0:12:58|Shortly after, [Miaomiao] took out the umbrella she carried with her, extended it outside the skylight to shield from the rain, and said, "At this moment, [Jiang Liangliang] found [Miaomiao] even more interesting, and the two burst into laughter."
0:12:58|0:13:12|The rain made the streets hazy, cars slowly driving on the road, with umbrellas on the car roofs catching attention. Soon night fell, and the colorful neon lights on the street flickered, cars flowing like a river.
0:13:12|0:13:29|At this moment, [Miaomiao] is frying the chicken in the pot, then she tilts her head back and chugs soda. Meanwhile, [Jiang Liangliang], who is eating the chicken, says, "After the two of us are full and satisfied, we leisurely walk out of the restaurant and stand on the street."
0:14:16|0:14:26|[Jiang Liangliang] casually put on the glasses displayed at the entrance of the store, smiled without saying a word, then [Miaomiao] took [Jiang Liangliang] to a bar, where the two sat in a booth leisurely listening to music.
0:14:52|0:15:8|After getting to know each other, [Miaomiao] and her sister whispered to each other, leaving [Jiang Liangliang] sitting awkwardly on the side. He then quickly found an excuse to justify himself.
0:15:10|0:15:24|At this moment, unaffected by others, [Jiang Liangliang] is playing the guitar and singing a beautiful song. Meanwhile, [Miaomiao], who has just finished using the restroom, slowly walks back to her seat with her head down, while [Miaomiao] steps onto the stage upon seeing him.
0:15:37|0:15:48|Provoked, [Jiang Liangliang] strides towards the stage.
0:15:56|0:16:4|[Jiang Liangliang] then stepped onto the stage, with his hands in the pockets of his jacket, and sang earnestly:
0:16:29|0:16:36|Encouraged by everyone, [Jiang Liangliang] casually picks up the guitar next to him and slings it over his shoulder.
0:16:49|0:17:10|After [Jiang Liangliang] revealed his true talent, everyone in the bar was shocked, their eyes fixed on him, unwilling to look away. Meanwhile, on the stage, [Jiang Liangliang] was singing passionately, and [Miaomiao] in the audience was impressed, staring at him intently, completely captivated by his singing, feeling that the person in front of her was full of stories.
0:17:10|0:17:27|Shortly after, a smile gradually appeared on [Miaomiao]'s face. Listening to his lyrics felt like they were written for herself, she shyly lowered her head. But when [Miaomiao] looked back at [Jiang Liangliang], reality brought her back. They only had a brief encounter, not reaching that level of relationship.
0:17:27|0:17:50|Shortly after, [Jiang Liangliang] returned to his residence and put all the discs into the box on the coffee table. At that moment, the computer made a sound. He set down the discs in his hand, turned around, dusted off his hands, and sat in front of the computer to reply to a message. "My life is so unlucky, packing up to move tomorrow," he typed with a smile. As he was about to continue typing, a message from the other side replied:
0:17:51|0:18:9|The next day after getting enough sleep, I'll come help you move. Early the next morning, the two of them squeezed into the packed truck full of luggage, with [Miaomiao] sleeping soundly in the corner, while [Jiang Liangliang] was dozing off on a cardboard box.
0:18:9|0:18:33|Before long, the truck arrived at the entrance of the residential area. With the help of the movers, the two of them moved their luggage into the room. Then, [Miaomiao] stood on a stool and neatly placed the books handed by [Jiang Liangliang] onto the bookshelf. After arranging the books, [Miaomiao] took a big step down from the stool and lay flat on the bed. Then, [Jiang Liangliang] who was standing beside also lay down.
0:18:37|0:19:1|The two relaxed individuals simultaneously rolled their bodies towards each other. As they gazed at each other, the atmosphere gradually became ambiguous. At this moment, a woman was already standing outside the door, sneakily peeking inside before entering the room and closing the door. However, lying on the bed, [Jiang Liangliang] and [Miaomiao] did not notice anything unusual. Just as [Jiang Liangliang] placed his hand on [Miaomiao]'s hand,
0:19:1|0:19:16|When they wanted to deepen their understanding, the woman walked into the bedroom. The two awkwardly got up and the woman said:
0:19:22|0:19:53|Meimei immediately took the bag from the shelf and moved away, while [Jiang Liangliang] looked at [Miaomiao] pretending to search for something in the corner, saying to Meimei: Meimei suddenly walked towards where [Miaomiao] was, pushed her aside to search for her strings. Awkwardly, [Miaomiao] stepped back and glared at [Jiang Liangliang] standing aside. Seeing Meimei searching through the stack of boxes on top, [Jiang Liangliang] walked over to help her take down the top box.
0:19:53|0:20:11|Meimei searched everywhere with no results, while [Miaomiao] awkwardly wiped the table lamp next to her. At this moment, [Jiang Liangliang] also opened the bag to help Meimei search. After Meimei confirmed, she looked disdainfully at [Jiang Liangliang], took the strings, blew off the dust on the music box, and threw it into the bag.
0:20:18|0:20:35|After finishing speaking, Meimei picked up the bag and walked towards the door. Then, [Jiang Liangliang] and [Miaomiao] cleared the miscellaneous items on the bed and prepared to change into clean sheets and duvet covers. While laying the sheets, [Jiang Liangliang] observed every move of [Miaomiao] and explained, "
0:20:56|0:21:7|[Jiang Liangliang], holding a bag, stopped walking outward, turned around to look at [Miaomiao] walking towards her. [Miaomiao] took the bag, placed it on a nearby cardboard box, and started flipping through it.
0:21:8|0:21:23|After speaking, she glanced at [Jiang Liangliang] leaning against the cardboard box, then she continued to rummage through the bag, only to discover some books with sexy women on the covers.
0:21:32|0:21:43|Miaomiao turned around and looked at Jiang Liangliang who was holding her, saying, then turned and walked towards the bedroom, the corner piled with cardboard boxes.
0:21:49|0:21:57|[Miaomiao] pushed [Jiang Liangliang] away and walked towards the radiator by the bedroom balcony, then sat on it. [Jiang Liangliang] walked to her side and hugged her.
0:21:59|0:22:11|After speaking, [Jiang Liangliang] leaned in to kiss [Miaomiao]'s face, but she pushed him away. Unable to bear [Miaomiao]'s provocation, [Jiang Liangliang] strode forward, cupped her face, and kissed her.
0:22:11|0:22:29|After grabbing the arms of [Jiang Liangliang] and trying to push him away, [Miaomiao] found her arms firmly held between his, her resistance futile. Stirred by desire, [Miaomiao] transformed from passive to active, her arms resting on [Jiang Liangliang]'s shoulders as she enjoyed his kisses.
0:22:29|0:22:48|The ambiguity escalated quickly as they moved from the balcony to the bed. With only underwear left, [Miaomiao] sat in the arms of [Jiang Liangliang], kissing him while twisting her seductive body. At this moment, [Jiang Liangliang]'s hands roamed on [Miaomiao]'s body, gently caressing every inch of her skin, expressing his love for her.
0:22:48|0:23:6|At night, as the two of them were entwined, [Jiang Liangliang] held [Miaomiao] in his arms in the bedroom. He then lit a cigarette, but didn't stop his actions, instead satisfyingly blowing the smoke he inhaled into the air.
0:23:13|0:23:21|At this moment, [Jiang Liangliang] stopped playing with [Miaomiao]'s ears, and with a smile on his face, he took another deep drag of his cigarette.
0:23:33|0:23:44|Miaomiao lay on Jiang Liangliang's chest waiting for his answer, but he remained silent. Miaomiao lifted her head to look at him, while he looked at her thoughtfully with a cigarette in his mouth.
0:23:47|0:24:13|[Miaomiao] stared at him intently, while he calmly said, leaning against the headboard, [Jiang Liangliang] impatiently: Then [Miaomiao] sat up straight, furrowing her brow as she moved to the edge of the bed. She snatched the cigarette from [Jiang Liangliang]'s hand, crushed it in the ashtray, and turned the bedside lamp towards [Jiang Liangliang].
0:24:16|0:24:22|Jiang Liangliang reached out to turn on the bedside lamp, sat up straight, and said bluntly:
0:25:44|0:25:57|Expressionless, [Miaomiao] withdrew her gaze from [Jiang Liangliang], pulled up the blanket and lay down on her side. [Jiang Liangliang] could only smile wryly, turned around to stroke [Miaomiao]'s arm and kissed her. At this moment, [Miaomiao], who was sulking, looked blankly and said,
0:25:58|0:26:5|[Jiang Liangliang] looked up and said gently to [Miaomiao],
0:26:11|0:26:24|At this moment, [Jiang Liangliang] placed his hand on [Miaomiao]'s hand, then rested his head on her shoulder. After a moment of contemplation, [Jiang Liangliang] lifted his head and looked at her, saying, [Miaomiao] smiled with satisfaction.
0:27:2|0:27:14|Miaomiao, who escaped from the set, immediately ran towards Jiang Liangliang, who had been waiting outside for a long time. After the two met, Miaomiao hung on Jiang Liangliang's waist, her arms around his neck, and then the two started kissing.
0:27:15|0:27:28|Continuing, the two of them arrived at the mall. In the honeymoon period, they always stuck together no matter when or where. Even when Jiang Liangliang was working the night shift, he still had video calls with Miaomiao. Even if she fell asleep, he didn't hang up.
0:27:38|0:28:4|[Miaomiao] remained silent and walked away, leaving [Jiang Liangliang] standing there feeling extremely embarrassed. Later, [Jiang Liangliang] rode a bike with [Miaomiao] on it, the two of them freely weaving through the streets. They then returned to their cozy love nest, where [Miaomiao] carefully washed [Jiang Liangliang]'s hands in the bathroom, while [Jiang Liangliang] repeatedly closed the door after taking out beer from the fridge.
0:28:21|0:28:40|Jiang Liangliang and Miaomiao followed the salesperson to the second floor of the lighting store. The salesperson walked ahead and turned on the gorgeous crystal chandelier. That night, the two of them lay on the bed, staring at the moonlight lamp above their heads.
0:28:41|0:28:48|The next day, [Miaomiao] was browsing in a phone store when she answered the phone.
0:30:4|0:30:17|The sound came from the next table, and [Miaomiao] felt it was very familiar. She turned her head and saw [Jiang Liangliang] who happened to be taking out his wallet. After they made eye contact, [Miaomiao] wiped her mouth and walked over to him.
0:30:17|0:30:23|Miaomiao then looked at Jiang Liangliang and then at Meimei. At this moment, Jiang Liangliang said:
0:30:30|0:30:43|[Miaomiao] unabashedly introduced [Jiang Liangliang] to the rich second generation. The rich second generation looked at [Jiang Liangliang] in confusion, while [Jiang Liangliang] moved in front of Meimei and looked at him. Meimei sat down in bewilderment, shaking her head in disbelief.
0:30:43|0:30:51|Later, the four of them sat at a table, with [Jiang Liangliang] and [Miaomiao] remaining silent. Meimei, who was fidgeting with a sugar packet, sat uneasily. The rich second generation spoke:
0:31:2|0:31:8|[Jiang Liangliang], who completely didn't believe, looked at [Miaomiao], while [Miaomiao] played with the spoon in the coffee cup.
0:31:12|0:31:17|[Jiang Liangliang] pondered for a long time before responding to what the rich second generation said.
0:31:25|0:31:48|After Meimei finished speaking, [Miaomiao] looked at her, then turned her gaze towards [Jiang Liangliang]. The rich second generation's mockery made [Jiang Liangliang] feel like he was in deep trouble. When he looked at [Miaomiao], she averted her eyes. That night, when [Jiang Liangliang] returned home, he walked towards the bathroom. As he lifted the toilet seat to use the toilet, he saw Meimei's photo burned in the toilet.
0:31:48|0:31:52|He sat on the toilet smoking, feeling helpless.
0:32:28|0:32:41|When [Miaomiao] took out the eye drops and dripped them into [Jiang Liangliang]'s eyes, [Jiang Liangliang] held [Miaomiao] in his arms and kissed her. Late at night, [Jiang Liangliang] carefully painted nail polish on [Miaomiao]'s toenails.
0:33:5|0:33:20|Lying on the bed, [Miaomiao] said to [Jiang Liangliang], who was drowsy, and lying flat on the bed: At this moment, [Jiang Liangliang] turned his body and embraced [Miaomiao].
0:33:20|0:33:41|In the morning after waking up the next day, [Jiang Liangliang] rushed to the bathroom. By this time, the dining table was already filled with a sumptuous breakfast. [Miaomiao] stood by the table pouring fresh milk into a cup. Shortly after, [Jiang Liangliang] emerged from the bathroom and stood in front of [Miaomiao], saying, "Stop right there." [Miaomiao] looked at [Jiang Liangliang] innocently.
0:33:47|0:33:55|With his face covered in graffiti, [Jiang Liangliang] turned around in surprise to look at her, then followed [Miaomiao] to the set.
0:34:10|0:34:33|At this moment, [Jiang Liangliang] sat in the middle of the hall, watching the passing beauties. He took out his phone without hesitation, with a silly smile on his face, capturing photos. As he was immersed in the ocean of beauties and unable to extricate himself, [Miaomiao] appeared behind him. [Miaomiao] at this moment remained silent, using an umbrella to hook onto [Jiang Liangliang]'s shoulder. When he turned his head and saw [Miaomiao], he immediately put away his smile. [Miaomiao], after glancing at [Jiang Liangliang], walked away speechlessly.
0:34:33|0:34:54|Outside, it was pouring rain. [Jiang Liangliang] and [Miaomiao] quickly opened the car door and got in. Sitting in the passenger seat, [Miaomiao] tightly closed her eyes. [Jiang Liangliang] looked worriedly at [Miaomiao] and asked her. [Miaomiao] raised her hand in response. [Jiang Liangliang] thought for a moment and asked again. At this moment, [Miaomiao] looked very aggrieved. [Jiang Liangliang] immediately took out a tissue.
0:35:6|0:35:12|Jiang Liangliang, who had a false alarm, sighed deeply and then sat up straight, comforting Miaomiao, saying,
0:35:17|0:35:45|Glancing sideways at [Miaomiao], [Jiang Liangliang] stared at her intently, then slowly leaned towards her face, earnestly saying something to her. At this moment, [Miaomiao] let down all her defenses, and [Jiang Liangliang] started the car and said, "Let's go." The car then drove off towards the street.
0:35:45|0:35:59|The street was deserted at this moment, with only the imprints of wheels left on the road. Inside the company where [Jiang Liangliang] works, everyone's eyes were fixed on Teacher He, who was pacing back and forth in the work area clutching his phone.
0:36:18|0:36:27|In the office, everyone was staring at this colleague. Suddenly, the female colleague, Jiang Liangliang, had a sudden realization and picked up the newspaper.
0:36:39|0:36:45|After Black Teacher finished reading the newspaper, he turned to look at Jiang Liangliang, who snatched the newspaper and walked towards Miaomiao, his female colleague.
0:37:8|0:37:23|At this moment, the rational [Jiang Liangliang] picked up the newspaper and glanced at it, then turned to Fei Shi and said, and Fei Shi, who was still angry, immediately handed the phone to [Jiang Liangliang].
0:37:27|0:37:40|Jiang Liangliang threw the phone to Fei Shit and looked at him with a contemptuous look.
0:37:58|0:38:11|Shortly after, [Jiang Liangliang] sitting on the chair moved to his own workstation, looking at the computer and skillfully typing on the keyboard. At this moment, [Miaomiao] stood up thoughtfully, picked up something next to the computer, and walked towards [Jiang Liangliang].
0:39:46|0:39:58|[Jiang Liangliang] took the phone and turned to walk outside. At that moment when [Jiang Liangliang] turned around, everyone understood, while Teacher Hei awkwardly looked around and finally fixed his gaze on [Jiang Liangliang] outside the glass window.
0:40:7|0:40:24|At this moment, Teacher He couldn't hide his embarrassment. He picked up the wine glass and took a big sip. After finishing the call, Jiang Liangliang patted Fei Shi's shoulder. Then Jia Liangliang handed the phone back to Teacher He, who looked at him. Jiang Liangliang poured wine while nodding smugly.
0:40:32|0:40:49|Meanwhile, [Miaomiao] was lying on [Jiang Liangliang]'s office desk, and she turned on the lamp given to [Jiang Liangliang] by Youyou. Suddenly, she lifted her head and opened the cover on the lamp, then discovered the words "I love you". She pressed the button again, and the words "I love you" were projected onto the wall.
0:40:52|0:41:18|[Miaomiao] held the lamp to her chest, spinning the chair while staring intently at the words "I love you" projected on the wall. Soon, [Jiang Liangliang] hurried over and looked at [Miaomiao], saying, "[Miaomiao] then picked up the lamp on the table and aimed it at [Jiang Liangliang], who looked on helplessly. The next day, [Miaomiao] sat on the bed in the bedroom, holding her own phone in one hand and [Jiang Liangliang]'s phone in the other.
0:41:18|0:41:27|He then entered a phone number from Jiang Liangliang's phone into his own phone, dialed the number, and waited for the other party to answer.
0:41:45|0:41:57|[Miaomiao] heard the sound of water flowing, quickly hung up the phone, put the mobile phone back in its original place, at this moment [Jiang Liangliang] opened the bathroom door and walked out, glanced at [Miaomiao], then turned and walked away.
0:42:0|0:42:11|After [Miaomiao] finished speaking, she handed the phone to [Jiang Liangliang]. After [Jiang Liangliang] took the phone, she put down her own phone and moved to the head of the bed, sitting down after [Jiang Liangliang].
0:42:17|0:42:32|Jiang Liangliang's gaze was fixed on the new phone, while Miaomiao, who was sulking, looked to the side. Belatedly, he reached out his hand towards Miaomiao's shoulder. After she moved away from him, he shifted closer to her, pressing his face against hers.
0:42:32|0:42:38|[Miaomiao] turned her head to look at [Jiang Liangliang] after hearing his special nickname, then she turned her face to the side and smiled.
0:42:40|0:42:48|[Miaomiao] looked at [Jiang Liangliang] with a puzzled expression on her face, then got up to open the door. She first looked through the peephole, and then opened the door.
0:42:51|0:42:57|[Jiang Liangliang], immersed in joy, is now very confused.
0:43:49|0:44:11|After [Jiang Liangliang] finished speaking, he angrily put on his shoes and walked out. [Miaomiao] called out insincerely to his back, but [Jiang Liangliang] was not affected by [Miaomiao]'s words. He simply walked out of the neighborhood. At that moment, his phone rang, it was [Miaomiao] calling him from the balcony. Looking at the caller ID on the phone, he chose to answer.
0:44:12|0:44:24|[Jiang Liangliang] looked around and didn't see [Miaomiao]'s figure, so he looked up at the tall building next to him.
0:44:28|0:44:33|After finishing speaking, [Miaomiao] leaned against the edge of the balcony window and stood on the outdoor unit of the air conditioner, looking down.
0:44:40|0:44:46|[Jiang Liangliang], who was climbing the stairs rapidly, did not hang up the phone, while [Miaomiao] said,
0:45:13|0:45:41|[Jiang Liangliang] rushed to the door, took out the key and opened it, saying, Jiang Liangliang, in a panic, stood on the balcony, staring closely at [Miaomiao] sitting on the balcony. At this moment, [Miaomiao] looked at the cigarette butt on the balcony and handed the cloth on the radiator to [Jiang Liangliang] after he regained his composure. [Miaomiao] then picked up the cloth and wrapped the cigarette butt in it, holding it in hand, and leaned against the frame, ready to come down.
0:45:41|0:45:54|[Jiang Liangliang] immediately walked over when he saw the situation, picked up [Miaomiao] and placed her on the bed. Then, panting heavily, [Jiang Liangliang] knelt down on the ground, holding [Miaomiao] in his arms and said to her:
0:46:2|0:46:14|[Jiang Liangliang] looked at [Miaomiao] solemnly, when suddenly his phone rang. [Miaomiao] then casually took out her phone from her pocket and said,
0:46:15|0:46:22|Miaomiao walked to the side, and Jiang Liangliang got up from the ground and lay on the bed panting.
0:46:24|0:46:38|Jiang Liangliang then heard Miaomiao finish the phone call and saw her walking towards him out of the corner of his eye. Jiang Liangliang sat up and looked at Miaomiao who was staring at him intently. Miaomiao then turned around expressionless and sat on the edge of the bed, saying,
0:46:40|0:46:53|With a bewildered look on his face, [Jiang Liangliang] let out a sigh and then sat down next to Miaomiao. Miaomiao stood up, looked at [Jiang Liangliang], and spoke.
0:46:54|0:47:15|Surprised, [Jiang Liangliang] stood up and saw the two excitedly embracing each other and falling onto the bed. Miaomiao then pressed [Jiang Liangliang] underneath her, while [Jiang Liangliang] helplessly hung his head down.
0:47:17|0:47:33|Miaomiao then lay on [Jiang Liangliang], who later took Miaomiao to the airport. The two stood in the airport lobby, with [Jiang Liangliang] looking at the sorrowful Miaomiao reluctantly. At that moment, [Jiang Liangliang] looked at Miaomiao with a heartache and said,
0:47:33|0:47:50|Miaomiao looked up at [Jiang Liangliang] in surprise, then they smiled at each other. But suddenly Miaomiao furrowed her brows, looking worriedly at [Jiang Liangliang], and said:
0:47:51|0:48:16|At this moment, [Jiang Liangliang], who pretended to be thinking, looked at the aggrieved Miaomiao, then leaned her head against his forehead and comforted her, saying, suddenly a large number of fans appeared.
0:48:25|0:48:42|[Jiang Liangliang] couldn't help but kiss the aggrieved Miaomiao on the face, and finally looked at her with reluctance and said: "Satisfied?" After Miaomiao made a funny face at [Jiang Liangliang], she grabbed the box and left. [Jiang Liangliang] stood in place waving goodbye to the gradually departing Miaomiao.
0:48:43|0:48:49|Miaomiao, standing at the boarding gate, turned back to [Jiang Liangliang] and made a scissor gesture, followed by a twisting motion.
0:48:50|0:48:55|At this moment, [Jiang Liangliang] watched as the plane flew across the sky, excitedly striking a successful pose.
0:48:55|0:49:14|At night, [Jiang Liangliang] and his friends arrived at the nightclub. They looked at the passing beautiful women with a knowing smile. Then they raised their glasses and clinked with everyone at the table, followed by tilting their heads back and drinking heavily. The colorful neon lights kept spinning inside the nightclub, and the air was filled with the smell of smoke and alcohol.
0:49:17|0:49:40|In the center of the dance floor, various girls were wildly moving their bodies to the deafening music. At this moment, [Jiang Liangliang], who was having a great time playing games with friends and beautiful girls, oblivious to the repeatedly vibrating phone on the table. The girl sitting beside him tapped [Jiang Liangliang], who was playing around, to remind him that his phone was ringing.
0:49:41|0:49:57|At this moment, [Jiang Liangliang] stared in astonishment at the screen of his phone, then he picked up the phone and ran through the crowded people towards the restroom. He stood in the restroom for a while without answering, and only after adjusting himself did he finally pick up the phone.
0:50:9|0:50:22|At this moment, [Miaomiao] sensed something and said, while [Jiang Liangliang] hesitated in the bathroom for a moment before returning to the original spot to continue speaking:
0:50:30|0:50:52|Upon returning home, [Jiang Liangliang] immediately went to the balcony to collect the laundry. The sight before him made him sigh, as he looked at the empty balcony lost in thought. The next day, in the company restroom, Fei Shitou said to [Jiang Liangliang]. Then, [Jiang Liangliang] walked out of the restroom, while Fei Shitou continued to speak.
0:50:55|0:51:0|After washing his hands, [Jiang Liangliang] looked into the mirror and said,
0:51:3|0:51:9|[Jiang Liangliang] looked at the fat excrement in the mirror, flicked the remaining water on his hand towards the mirror, and then turned and walked away.
0:51:10|0:51:37|After work, [Jiang Liangliang] slowly opened the door with his tired body. As he changed his shoes, he suddenly noticed that the light in the room was on. He then found luggage next to the shoe cabinet. While he was looking through it, [Miaomiao] walked towards the dining table with a bowl and chopsticks. Startled, [Jiang Liangliang] looked at [Miaomiao], then turned and walked towards the bathroom. After washing his hands, [Jiang Liangliang] pulled out a chair and sat across from [Miaomiao].
0:51:37|0:51:53|While [Miaomiao] was expressionless as she served food into his bowl, [Jiang Liangliang] picked up his chopsticks, his eyes fixed on [Miaomiao]. Suddenly, [Miaomiao] stopped her movements, and [Jiang Liangliang] shifted his gaze away, eating his meal heartily.
0:51:55|0:52:16|Miaomiao then picked up a piece of vegetable and put it into her mouth, chewing for a moment before swallowing. Jiang Liangliang looked at Miaomiao in confusion, feeling anxious. Miaomiao, on the other hand, stared at him intently, probing for answers.
0:52:58|0:53:18|After speaking, [Jiang Liangliang] stood up and walked towards [Miaomiao], put down her chopsticks, and pulled her to the desk in the bedroom. Then he sat [Miaomiao] on the desk, and as she settled down, [Miaomiao] stared intently at [Jiang Liangliang]. Meanwhile, [Jiang Liangliang] took out a piece of paper from the bookshelf behind [Miaomiao] and began to read it carefully.
0:53:20|0:53:27|Suddenly, [Miaomiao] snatched the paper away, while [Jiang Liangliang] took the paper and said,
0:53:49|0:53:55|Miaomiao, who is currently bowing her head, is laughing uncontrollably.
0:54:4|0:54:11|Miaomiao took the paper from Jiang Liangliang's hand and said:
0:54:42|0:55:4|Suddenly, [Jiang Liangliang] picked up [Miaomiao] who was sitting on the table and pressed her down on the bed, wanting to prove his attitude with practical actions. The apology letter was fixed on the bookshelf by [Miaomiao]. Outside in the early morning mist, in the bedroom filled with love, the two people lying on the bed embraced tightly. Suddenly, the phone ringing woke up [Jiang Liangliang]. With sleepy eyes, he released the hand holding [Miaomiao].
0:55:5|0:55:13|Reaching for the phone placed on the bedside table, he first glanced at the caller ID, then pressed the answer button and put it to his ear.
0:55:15|0:55:29|Suddenly, [Jiang Liangliang] opened his eyes and exclaimed in surprise. He then turned his head to look at [Miaomiao], who was lying next to him, and saw that she was completely still.
0:55:29|0:55:55|Continuing to listen carefully to what the other person was saying, [Jiang Liangliang] looked thoughtfully at the ceiling and replied, "Then he hung up the phone and put his phone back on the bedside table. Frustrated, he suppressed his inner anger. Suddenly, [Jiang Liangliang] sat up straight, while [Miaomiao], who had already woken up from sleep, impatiently turned over. Then, [Jiang Liangliang], increasingly puzzled, spoke up at this moment and asked:
0:55:58|0:56:3|After listening, [Miaomiao] slowly opened her eyes and, while moving her body, said to him:
0:56:22|0:56:30|Miaomiao then got up and walked towards the bathroom to freshen up, leaving Jiang Liangliang alone in place, watching her back as she left.
0:57:18|0:57:39|[Miaomiao] picked up the glass bottle at her feet, only to threaten [Jiang Liangliang], but the furious [Jiang Liangliang] smashed the bottle in [Miaomiao]'s hand against his own head, then turned and walked away. At this moment, tears welled up in [Miaomiao]'s eyes as she stood at the door watching his back. Afterwards, [Miaomiao] directly used her hands to clean up the broken glass bottle and knelt on the ground, wiping the floor clean with a cloth.
0:57:39|0:57:52|Continuing on, she scrubbed the toilet and the washbasin, using housework to calm herself down. At this moment, she kept all her grievances hidden in her heart, while tears stubbornly lingered in her eyes.
0:57:54|0:58:2|The autumn rain drizzled on the street, like an endless curtain, hazy and desolate, everything seemed so lonely and melancholic.
0:58:2|0:58:20|And [Miaomiao], holding an umbrella, stood in front of the flower shop, glanced at the flowers displayed on the left and right of the shop, and then pushed the door open. At this moment, the night enveloped the earth, the originally dim street lights on both sides of the street appeared even more gloomy in the hazy night, and even the air became particularly heavy.
0:58:21|0:58:29|Vehicles of all kinds flow continuously on the road, causing a traffic jam, while [Miaomiao] calmly walks on the street holding flowers.
0:58:32|0:58:38|On the other side, [Jiang Liangliang] sat in the meeting room absent-mindedly, looking around, while others discussed advertising strategies.
0:59:8|0:59:33|Awkwardly picking up the water cup, and after [Jiang Liangliang] stopped scratching his head, he opened the notebook he carried with him, on which was written "I can" in two words. Then, emphasizing the exclamation mark, he forcefully broke the pen tip, and then threw the notebook to the teacher. As the teacher picked up the notebook and looked at it, he froze when he turned to look at [Jiang Liangliang].
0:59:34|0:59:53|At this moment, [Jiang Liangliang] stood there like a statue, blood dripping down from his forehead. He seemed unfazed, but his actions shocked everyone present. It was Black Teacher's cries that brought [Jiang Liangliang] back to reality. He then reached out to touch his face, and when he looked at his hand again, it was already stained with blood.
0:59:54|1:0:18|At night, [Jiang Liangliang] returned home. As he sat at the dining table, [Miaomiao] immediately stood up and brought slippers to him. He looked at the remorseful [Miaomiao] in front of him, softened his heart, leaned against the wall to change into the slippers, and then slowly walked towards the table. Looking at the intricate flowers on the table, [Miaomiao] standing beside him said in confusion:
1:0:24|1:0:33|Sitting at the dining table one after another, the gloomy [Miaomiao] takes out a toothpick from the side and sticks it into the fruit plate, while [Jiang Liangliang] suddenly speaks up,
1:0:46|1:0:52|Miaomiao then inserted toothpicks into the four corners of the fruit plate, and said:
1:1:18|1:1:32|At this moment, [Jiang Liangliang] looked at [Miaomiao] helplessly and said, "After finishing speaking, [Jiang Liangliang] got up, changed his shoes, and walked out, while [Miaomiao] sat motionless at the dining table."
1:1:33|1:1:39|Late at night, the street lights on the roadside emit a bright yellow light, with few pedestrians at this moment, occasionally a vehicle passing by.
1:1:40|1:1:57|At this moment, [Jiang Liangliang] wrapped his clothes tightly around him, arms crossed in front, striding forward. The thinly dressed [Miaomiao] followed closely behind, running to catch up with [Jiang Liangliang]. Suddenly, [Jiang Liangliang] stopped, turned around, and looked at [Miaomiao] who was following closely, then spoke to her.
1:2:0|1:2:25|As they walked through the residential area, [Jiang Liangliang] immediately started running faster when they reached the parking area, with [Miaomiao] closely following suit. The two of them jogged out of the neighborhood, slowed down their pace when they saw the bustling crowd, then picked up speed again after passing through the crowd, and finally arrived on the street.
1:2:50|1:3:8|Time seemed to stand still at this moment. [Jiang Liangliang]'s words angered [Miaomiao], prompting her to turn and walk into the flowing traffic. Fortunately, the vehicles were moving slowly, allowing them to brake abruptly and swerve around [Miaomiao] before continuing forward. The cars behind urgently honked their horns to warn [Miaomiao] not to proceed further.
1:3:9|1:3:23|The sound of the horn drew the attention of [Jiang Liangliang], who immediately turned around and ran towards [Miaomiao] in the traffic, grabbing her in his arms. Then [Jiang Liangliang] forcibly dragged [Miaomiao] to the side of the road, and the passing vehicles stopped one after another to make way for them.
1:3:23|1:3:50|Moving to the side of the road, the two of them embraced tightly. [Miaomiao] hid in [Jiang Liangliang]'s arms, silently crying. She was afraid of losing the man in front of her, while [Jiang Liangliang] had not yet recovered from the recent danger. At the same time, he did not want anything to happen to [Miaomiao]. He then lifted [Miaomiao]'s head, looking at her with eyes full of tenderness. After comforting [Miaomiao]'s emotions, [Jiang Liangliang] took her back to the room.
1:3:50|1:4:0|In the bedroom, [Jiang Liangliang] lay on the bed with his head propped up, while [Miaomiao] was lying down, both staring intently at each other. Then [Miaomiao] spoke up,
1:4:18|1:4:28|Jiang Liangliang, lost in thought, slowly turned his eyes to the side and said:
1:4:40|1:4:50|[Jiang Liangliang] stared at [Miaomiao] intently, suddenly thought of something, laughed out loud, then said something astonishing, followed by tears welling up in her eyes.
1:4:51|1:4:55|The next day, [Jiang Liangliang] and [Miaomiao] walked in the community under the guidance of the agent.
1:5:48|1:5:56|Returning home in the evening, [Jiang Liangliang] picked up a half-smoked cigarette from the cigarette box, blew off the ash on the tip, and lit it.
1:5:58|1:6:17|Satisfied, he leaned back on the chair enjoying the pleasure brought by the cigarette. But after taking the second puff, the sound of the door suddenly entered his ears. He quickly took a deep breath, extinguished it in the ashtray, then hid the ashtray in the ornament behind the bookshelf, waving away the smoke in the air.
1:6:24|1:6:40|Shortly after [Miaomiao] went to take a shower, [Jiang Liangliang] stood up to move a decoration aside. As he was about to grab the ashtray, his phone rang. He put the decoration back in place, sat on the stool, picked up the phone, and looked at the caller ID. After hesitating for a moment, he pressed the answer button.
1:6:43|1:6:48|[Jiang Liangliang] looked up at the bookshelf and said,
1:7:5|1:7:14|After hanging up the phone, [Jiang Liangliang] blew away the cigarette ash on the table, put down the phone and looked towards the bookshelf to search for something. At that moment, [Miaomiao] walked out of the bathroom.
1:7:23|1:7:29|Miaomiao then massaged her own calf, and then she picked up a towel and threw it towards Jiang Liangliang.
1:7:42|1:7:57|[Miaomiao] took a sip from the water cup, then placed it on the bedside table. She then crawled into the bed, covered herself with the blanket, turned to the side, and fell asleep. Meanwhile, [Jiang Liangliang] sat at the table, watching [Miaomiao] sleep, unconsciously swallowing saliva.
1:7:58|1:8:6|He then looked at the bookshelf, and soon he appeared in the rain holding an umbrella. After finishing the cigarette in his hand, he walked into the restaurant in front of him.
1:8:8|1:8:22|Sitting by the window in the restaurant, Miaomiao was reading a book. When Jiang Liangliang saw Miaomiao, he walked straight towards her. Miaomiao noticed him and closed the book.
1:8:29|1:8:40|Jiang Liangliang then sat across from Miaomiao, and Jiang Liangliang laughed when he saw the books beside him.
1:9:30|1:9:44|[Jiang Liangliang] returned to the room stealthily in no time, quietly closed the door, then put away the umbrella and changed into slippers as if nothing had happened. However, in his nervous state, he failed to notice that [Miaomiao]'s shoes next to him were also soaked through the soles.
1:9:45|1:10:4|When he thought [Miaomiao] had fallen asleep, he started taking off his clothes and walked towards the bedroom. Suddenly, [Miaomiao] spoke up: "..." [Jiang Liangliang] then placed his coat on the chair, turned around and headed towards the bathroom. Once he entered the bathroom, [Miaomiao] turned her body to look in the direction of the bathroom.
1:10:4|1:10:28|At this moment, [Jiang Liangliang] leaned against the sink, the water in the faucet kept running. After a moment of contemplation, he decided to turn off the faucet and walked out of the bathroom to face the problem. However, as he stood at the bathroom door, he saw [Miaomiao] changing the sheets and chose to remain silent. He then lay down on the bed to prepare for sleep. Just as he closed his eyes, [Miaomiao] suddenly knelt in front of him.
1:10:29|1:10:42|After hesitating for a moment, [Miaomiao] finally slapped [Jiang Liangliang] awake. At that moment, [Jiang Liangliang] looked at [Miaomiao] in confusion. Then [Miaomiao] said, "Jiang Liangliang fell into contemplation as he gazed at [Miaomiao] in front of him."
1:10:43|1:10:50|The next day on the company's balcony, [Jiang Liangliang] said:
1:11:8|1:11:51|Surprised, [Fei Shi] looked up and continued to say to [Jiang Liangliang]: Then [Jiang Liangliang], who was lying on the railing with a vacant look, suddenly exclaimed. [Fei Shi] looked at [Jiang Liangliang] in astonishment, and when he saw him smoking in distress, [Teacher Hei] looked at [Jiang Liangliang] and said: Then [Jiang Liangliang] threw away the cigarette in his hand, turned around and left. On the balcony, [Teacher Hei] and [Fei Shi] stood there and smiled at each other.
1:12:5|1:12:20|After the director's command, [Miaomiao] took off the bathrobe wrapped around her body. She then shook the hair mixed in her clothes, placed both hands on the shore, and lowered her body into the water. Due to the influence of gravity, her body sank to the bottom of the water.
1:12:20|1:12:46|At the bottom of the water, there is a glass wall, with several photographers standing outside, each holding a camera to capture [Miaomiao]'s movements. She then sways her graceful figure freely in the water, with a photographer closely following her to capture her from all angles. However, at this moment, [Miaomiao] is not in the mood to enjoy all the beauty, but is thinking about [Jiang Liangliang].
1:12:46|1:12:53|She didn't know what to do to make [Jiang Liangliang] truly fall in love with her and have him be the only woman by his side.
1:12:55|1:13:19|On the other side, [Jiang Liangliang] stood at the entrance of the convenience store, holding his wallet to pay the owner. After the owner took the money, he handed over the packed vegetables to him. Then he carried the vegetables and walked into the residential area. Later, [Jiang Liangliang] appeared in the kitchen, wearing an apron and standing in front of the gas stove. He poured the prepared vegetables into the pot one after another, and immediately started stir-frying with a spatula.
1:13:20|1:13:29|Suddenly he heard the phone ringing, then he ran out with a ladle, and after answering the call, he immediately returned to the kitchen.
1:13:43|1:14:16|After turning off the gas stove, [Jiang Liangliang] sat at the desk. Staring at the screen, [Jiang Liangliang] saw his own image on it. He then moved his body to locate the camera, turned around to look behind him, placed his phone on the table, and walked towards the direction of the camera.
1:14:16|1:14:43|He repeatedly looked at the screen to determine the exact position of the camera, so he moved the stool under the camera and stood on the stool to search for the camera. Suddenly, he found the hidden camera in a narrow gap. Before long, [Jiang Liangliang] appeared in the hot pot restaurant, accompanied by [Teacher Hei] and [Fei Shi]. He sat by the window, furrowing his brow, took a big sip of beer, and then smoked a cigarette.
1:14:45|1:14:51|The fat man at the table behind them shifted his body backward, and [Jiang Liangliang] moved the chair forward.
1:15:25|1:15:31|[Jiang Liangliang] took a big sip of beer,
1:16:12|1:16:36|Shortly after, Teacher Hei looked at Fei Shi sitting next to him, who then smiled. Their gazes both turned to [Jiang Liangliang]. At that moment, [Jiang Liangliang] blew on the vegetables just taken out of the pot, then ate them heartily. The chubby guy behind him leaned back in his chair and as he moved the stool back, [Jiang Liangliang] patted his shoulder. The chubby guy turned around and looked at [Jiang Liangliang].
1:16:38|1:17:8|While Black and Fat Shit watched quietly, Jiang Liangliang stood up with disdain as Fat Shit finished speaking and placed the stool next to him. Then Jiang Liangliang spat out all the food in his mouth. Fat Shit's words once again angered Liangliang, so he stood up, picked up the scalding hot pot, and poured it directly over Fat Shit's head.
1:17:9|1:17:37|As soon as Black and Fat Shit saw Fatty turn around, they immediately stood up and threw everything on the table at him. The scene was chaotic, with the customers who were eating already running out the door. On the other side, Miaomiao, who was sulking, stood at the door, took out her phone, looked at the name on the screen, then closed the phone. Suddenly, the door was opened, and Jiang Liangliang, who had just returned, saw Miaomiao holding the phone and waiting for him, but she didn't speak.
1:17:37|1:17:50|Instead of closing the door slowly, he walked straight past [Miaomiao], with [Jiang Liangliang] not changing into slippers at this moment, but heading straight to the bedroom, taking out the suitcase and placing it on the bed.
1:17:50|1:18:16|Miaomiao then turned around and quietly looked at him, asking: Jiang Liangliang finished speaking casually, then opened the suitcase and started searching for the charger and spare medicine on one side. Meanwhile, Miaomiao walked towards the cabinet, opened it, took out all of Jiang Liangliang's clothes, placed them on the bed to help him pack, but then Jiang Liangliang took out all the clothes.
1:18:44|1:18:50|[Miaomiao] looked at him fiercely and said, "Then [Jiang Liangliang] responded to her coldly."
1:18:52|1:19:17|At this moment, [Miaomiao] had tears in her eyes, all the disappointment surged in her heart, while [Jiang Liangliang] suppressed his inner emotions. [Jiang Liangliang] turned around and tears welled up in his eyes. Finally, [Jiang Liangliang] saw the apology letter pinned to the bookshelf. He tore it off, looked at it in his hand, and then tore it to pieces.
1:19:17|1:19:37|[Miaomiao] immediately went to grab the paper from his hand after seeing it, then she stood on a chair, took down a box from the top of the bookshelf, searched for the bank card, and tightly held the bank card in her hand. She caught up with [Jiang Liangliang] who was about to leave, and then hugged him.
1:19:49|1:19:55|Shortly after, [Jiang Liangliang] rushed out of the door, with [Miaomiao] catching up and saying:
1:20:7|1:20:36|[Jiang Liangliang], who was only left with his clothes, walked out of the neighborhood. [Miaomiao] continued to follow him, then suddenly hit [Jiang Liangliang] with the clothes and ran towards him. The two chased each other all the way until [Jiang Liangliang] saw a police car parked on the side of the road and got in.
1:20:57|1:21:7|At this moment, the police car was surrounded by onlookers. Everyone was discussing the appearance of the two individuals. Then, [Jiang Liangliang] filled out the form, while [Miaomiao] stood aside crying.
1:21:20|1:21:36|Jiang Liangliang then took a taxi, and the driver silently observed Jiang Liangliang sitting in the back seat through the rearview mirror. Jiang Liangliang, holding onto his exposed arms tightly, then said:
1:22:15|1:22:32|Continuing, [Jiang Liangliang] rested his head on his hand and fell into deep thought. As drowsiness hit him with the swaying of the car, he peacefully fell asleep leaning against the backrest of the seat. Suddenly, [Miaomiao] knocked on the door of the fat cat's room.
1:22:34|1:22:50|[Miaomiao] broke into Fei Shi's house. She looked around the empty living room, then Fei Shi closed the door and stood in front of her, looking at her in surprise. [Miaomiao] opened the curtains in the living room, searching for [Jiang Liangliang]'s figure, then questioned Fei Shi.
1:23:7|1:23:23|[Miaomiao] searched every corner of the cabinet, then immediately turned to look at another room. Fatty Shi wanted to stop her, but couldn't. [Miaomiao] looked at the human-shaped figure curled up under the covers on the bed in front of her. She slowly walked over and lifted the covers.
1:23:25|1:23:49|Miaomiao, who was curled up inside, immediately sat up, disappointed, turned and walked out. Fat Shit, who was leaning against the door, wordlessly made way for her. At this moment, standing in the living room, Miaomiao, dressed thinly, endured the helplessness in her heart. At this moment, her inner defenses broke, she sobbed softly, then stopped crying with tears streaming down her face, gradually calming down.
1:23:49|1:24:9|After adjusting her emotions, she turned around and looked at Fei Shi standing behind her, saying: At this moment, Fei Shi was helpless, looking at the pitiful [Miaomiao] in front of him, unable to do anything but shed tears. [Miaomiao] smiled at her own foolishness, then turned and walked away.
1:24:9|1:24:22|Meanwhile, [Jiang Liangliang] was standing outside Fei Shi's balcony, gripping the edge of the balcony window tightly against the wall. He then looked up at the sky, sighing inwardly at how disheveled he was tonight.
1:24:22|1:24:40|On the bustling street, the autumn wind blows, causing the leaves to fall one by one, painting the ground in golden hues. Meanwhile, in the hotel room, [Jiang Liangliang] lies on the bed looking at her phone, while [Miaomiao] sits on the bed flipping through the channels on the TV.
1:24:52|1:25:14|At this moment, [Jiang Liangliang]'s hand was very sincere, as he sent a text message to Miaomiao saying: Let's sit together. After a while, his phone rang, and he continued to text: Just broke up. Then Miaomiao threw a pillow at [Jiang Liangliang] and walked out. [Jiang Liangliang] then looked at Miaomiao's reply.
1:25:14|1:25:20|Would you like me to accompany you? Where are you? I'll come right over. [Jiang Liangliang] then got up to take a shower.
1:25:20|1:25:43|While he was taking a shower, someone entered the room with a room key. At that moment, [Jiang Liangliang] was drying his hair. He seemed to see someone sitting on the bed. After getting dressed, he walked out. As he walked out of the bathroom, he saw clearly the person sitting on the bed, who was [Miaomiao]. He stood still and looked at [Miaomiao] without saying a word. At the same time, [Miaomiao] also looked at him. The two of them quietly gazed at each other.
1:25:49|1:25:57|With a vacant look in his eyes, [Jiang Liangliang] gazes at [Miaomiao], who stands up to help him pick up the bag of clothes lying on the side, then says,
1:25:59|1:26:5|After saying that, [Miaomiao] smiled at [Jiang Liangliang], then brushed past him and left through the door.
1:26:5|1:26:27|[Jiang Liangliang] suddenly woke up when [Miaomiao] closed the door and left. He looked in the direction she was heading as if he understood something. Then he immediately looked at the phone next to the bed. He picked up the phone and dialed Meimei's number. At the same time, [Miaomiao]'s phone, which was not far away, suddenly rang. She took out her phone from her bag and answered the call.
