0:0:44|0:1:4|[Qi Jia] boarded a bus with vacant eyes. A little girl offered her seat to him. [Qi Jia] glanced at the girl sideways. Looking around, [Qi Jia] confirmed that the woman the girl mentioned was herself. [Qi Jia] firmly grasped the girl's face.
0:1:4|0:1:10|She ambitiously shook the girl's cheeks back and forth, unceremoniously taking the seat the girl had vacated.
0:1:11|0:1:20|Several passengers in front turned their heads angrily to glare at him. [Qi Jia] looked back and saw the whole car casting accusing glances at him.
0:1:23|0:1:32|The onlookers' eyes were relentless, but [Qi Jia] couldn't be bothered to pay attention to them. She turned her head and looked out the window. A lush greenery passed by, and tears gradually welled up in her eyes.
0:1:45|0:1:52|In Qi Jia's eyes, a graceful figure in a wedding dress is reflected. The scene shifts back to 2009.
0:1:54|0:2:5|[Qi Jia] is wearing a wedding dress, running in high-heeled shoes with straps tied around her ankles, struggling to run under the shade of trees on the university campus. She is panting heavily as she runs, attracting the attention of her classmates along the way.
0:2:7|0:2:25|[Qi Jia] pushed open the doors of the auditorium, the carpet in front leading all the way to the colorful stage. Graduates in academic gowns filled the seats on both sides of the auditorium. As he walked in, Lin Shuer helped him lift the trailing wedding dress. Amid cheers, [Qi Jia] mischievously looked up, pointing at the classmates by the aisle.
0:2:29|0:2:41|He walked to the front row, waved to everyone, and walked with Lin Shuer to a handsome and gentle-looking boy, who asked quietly.
0:2:58|0:3:9|Liu Chong beside [Qi Jia], slowly stood up with the manuscript and walked to the platform, bowing deeply to everyone. [Qi Jia] never took her eyes off him, smiling and applauding.
0:3:25|0:3:41|Liu Chong finished his passionate speech and was about to step down from the stage when [Qi Jia] suddenly stood up and walked towards him. [Qi Jia] smiled at everyone and then at Liu Chong. The principal on the stage gestured for everyone to be quiet and spoke into the microphone.
0:3:54|0:3:59|[Qi Jia] lifted her skirt, ran to Liu Chong's side, took his arm, and pulled him in front of the principal.
0:4:16|0:4:20|Li Teng boiled over again, [Qi Jia] turned towards him, holding Liu Chong's arm.
0:4:45|0:4:53|Liu Chong was extremely embarrassed, with classmates focusing intently on the stage, [Lin Shuer] even clasping her hands in front of her chest.
0:4:55|0:5:1|Liu Chong pushed away [Qi Jia]'s hand, and her eyes instantly lost focus, her mind going blank.
0:5:7|0:5:9|And at the next moment, something unexpected happened.
0:5:12|0:5:23|[Qi Jia], with a dazed expression, was helped out of the hall by [Lin Shuer]. As the scene unfolded, a few words fell down and gradually merged with a gynecological medical record, with the title appearing: "My Early Menopausal Girlfriend".
0:5:23|0:5:40|In this film, [Qi Jia] had been in a long-term relationship with her [Ex-Boyfriend], and their relationship had always been very good. However, to [Qi Jia]'s surprise, her [Ex-Boyfriend], whom she thought she would smoothly marry, unexpectedly rejected her on the day of graduation. From then on, [Qi Jia]'s nightmare began.
0:5:41|0:5:50|The failed love experience has plunged [Qi Jia] into an unbearable pain. A series of menopausal symptoms have appeared one after another on the young [Qi Jia].
0:5:50|0:6:7|At this moment, a man named [Yuan Xiaoou] suddenly barged into his life, causing a commotion in the hospital corridor. The place was crowded with people, and [Qi Jia] sat on a bench outside the gynecology clinic. He had short hair and a short fringe above his eyebrows, and after exchanging a glance with the big brother next to him, he looked away.
0:6:8|0:6:11|The middle-aged woman in the consultation room wiped her sweat and said to [Doctor].
0:6:55|0:7:2|[The doctor] leaned in close to [Qi Jia]'s face, carefully examining her. [The doctor] then lowered his head to look through the medical records.
0:7:16|0:7:23|[Qi Jia] stood up in anger and squatted deeply in front of the [doctor]. The [doctor]'s eyes followed [Qi Jia]'s movements up and down.
0:7:24|0:7:27|[Qi Jia] cursed while picking up the cactus on the table and thrusting it towards the face of the [doctor].
0:7:51|0:8:0|[Qi Jia] lay on the grass with sunglasses on. [Lin Shuer] bent down and looked at her. [Lin Shuer] knelt beside [Qi Jia].
0:8:18|0:8:21|[Ling Shuer] stuffs [Qi Jia] into the passenger seat of the sports car.
0:8:31|0:8:36|Every year at this time, graduates always dress up the peaceful summer nights wildly and catch up.
0:8:49|0:8:56|On the day of graduation, [Qi Jia] in a wedding dress, leaning on the railing and vomiting, sat on the steps under the shade of a tree with Lin Shuer.
0:9:3|0:9:10|[Qi Jia] pouted in grievance, burying her head on Lin Shuer's shoulder, and Lin Shuer quickly patted her to show comfort.
0:9:31|0:9:44|On the balcony of the dormitory building, countless sheets hang down, expressing the sadness of parting. Some people are lighting candles and drinking beer on the grass, while others are sitting in a circle singing loudly. A long-haired man desperately grabs a short-haired man and shouts.
0:9:48|0:9:56|Qi Jia and Lin Shuer laughed until their stomachs hurt, then two guys wearing only underwear ran out onto the street.
0:10:9|0:10:25|Lin Shuer simply carried [Qi Jia] on his back. Ling Shuer ran with her in his arms, and the two stumbled their way up the stairs to the dormitory door. Ling Shuer reached out and turned the doorknob.
0:10:27|0:10:31|Ling Shuer pressed her ear against the door to listen carefully.
0:10:50|0:11:5|Glancing back into the room, with a shy and lazy expression, she hurriedly ran down the stairs clutching her clothes in a daze. In her panic, she even left a sneaker in the hallway, and [Qi Jia] quickly turned on the light and rushed into the dormitory.
0:11:59|0:12:15|Old Bai, with his shirt not properly buttoned, carries a storage box towards the door, then turns around to bid farewell. The dormitory door is closed by Old Bai, and the painting on the door gradually transforms into a real alleyway.
0:12:27|0:12:39|On the wall of the alley, a pear blossom cat is lying, and a homeless man is lying on the ground in a makeshift bed. He gets up and looks towards a corner not far away, where [Yuan Xiaoou] is sitting, gnawing on sugar cane, with a pile of luggage beside her.
0:12:43|0:13:9|[Yuan Xiaoou] ignored the beggar while gnawing on sugar cane. The beggar stood up and kept muttering. When he saw someone leaving the house, he immediately rushed to snatch the bag. [Yuan Xiaoou] turned his head and saw someone being pulled by the beggar, so he quickly ran over with the sugar cane in his mouth.
0:13:13|0:13:22|[Yuan Xiaoou] shielded [Qi Jia] behind her and pointed at the vagrant with a sugarcane. She sprayed the sugarcane residue in her mouth all over the vagrant.
0:13:32|0:13:37|[Yuan Xiaoou] handed the keys in his pocket to the homeless man, who then squatted down and cursed while crying.
0:13:42|0:13:46|She locked eyes with [Qi Jia] and immediately turned her head without saying a word.
0:13:51|0:13:57|The door was pushed open, [Qi Jia] walked in with [Yuan Xiaoou], and Lin Shuer on the sofa stood up in surprise.
0:14:26|0:14:29|Qi Jia pulled Lin Shuer to the window and pleaded.
0:15:14|0:15:18|The two cleared out a room for [Yuan Xiaoou] to stay. Lin Shuer didn't forget to remind her.
0:15:22|0:15:29|Watching Lin Shuer leave, [Yuan Xiaoou] breathed a sigh of relief, lowering her head with a triumphant smile. Time passed.
0:15:32|0:15:42|A sports car arrived at the stairs of the lane, Lin Shuer parked the car, and [Qi Jia] also climbed down from the passenger seat. Lin Shuer lifted [Qi Jia] up.
0:17:3|0:17:10|[Yuan Xiaoou] carried [Qi Jia] back to the room. [Qi Jia] went to the hospital today. Lin Shuer continued speaking while holding a glass of water.
0:17:26|0:17:28|[Yuan Xiaoou], still wearing an apron, asked.
0:17:37|0:17:43|[Yuan Xiaoou] closed her eyes tightly and uttered a word. Lin Shuer looked at her with interest.
0:18:8|0:18:28|Lin Shuer turned and left, leaving [Yuan Xiaoou] standing there in a daze. The bedroom was dimly lit, and [Yuan Xiaoou] sat on the edge of the bed, using a towel to wipe [Qi Jia]'s hands. While [Qi Jia] was sound asleep, her hand kept restlessly pulling away from the towel. [Yuan Xiaoou] patiently grabbed her wrist, continuing to gently wipe with the towel.
0:18:30|0:18:49|Qi Jia tossed and turned like a child in her dreams, her head on the pillow, sometimes facing up and sometimes on her side. Suddenly, she shook off the hand held by [Yuan Xiaoou]. [Yuan Xiaoou] finally stopped and gazed at Qi Jia for a long time, her gentle face reminiscent of the way she used to secretly watch Qi Jia in college.
0:18:50|0:19:7|At that moment, he hid behind the bookshelves in the library, peering through the cracks at Qi Jia who was reading. When Qi Jia looked up, he quickly crouched down like a turtle retracting into its shell. It wasn't until Qi Jia looked away that he finally dared to shuffle a few steps forward along the bookshelves.
0:19:7|0:19:15|[Yuan Xiaoou] walked quietly, but her eyes never left Qi Jia, who was reading on the sofa. Liu Chong entered his line of sight holding a cat.
0:19:18|0:19:37|Liu Chong embraced Qi Jia, playing with the little kitten in their hands. The two of them intimately sat on the sofa for a while, then picked up the cat and left the library arm in arm. Yuan Xiaoou put down the book in front of her face, leaned against the window, biting her hand, and cried softly.
0:19:37|0:19:45|Awakening from a dream, [Yuan Xiaoou] sees [Qi Jia] sitting on the edge of the bed, staring at him.
0:19:50|0:19:52|[Yuan Xiaoou] raised her hand and wiped her eyes.
0:19:57|0:20:8|[Qi Jia] stood up, but involuntarily leaned towards the wall, using her shoulder to slide along the wall bit by bit. She turned around with her back against the wall, frowning and clutching her stomach.
0:20:18|0:20:28|[Qi Jia] walked to the window while drinking water, finishing the whole glass in one go. He looked out the window and let out a long sigh. [Yuan Xiaoou] also relaxed along with him.
0:21:9|0:21:13|[Qi Jia] stared at [Yuan Xiaoou], clearly struck a nerve with her words. [Qi Jia] walked away holding her stomach, while [Yuan Xiaoou] continued to chatter on.
0:21:53|0:22:7|[Qi Jia] was speechless with anger and immediately ordered the person to leave. [Yuan Xiaoou] huffed and turned to leave without closing the door. Just as [Qi Jia] was about to slam the door shut, she was stopped by [Yuan Xiaoou]. Holding up a photo, she said.
0:22:19|0:22:23|[Qi Jia] followed her anger inside the door, while [Yuan Xiaoou] leaned against the door outside, determined.
0:22:27|0:22:38|Qi Jia picked up a photo from the ground, which was their graduation photo. Qi Jia was wearing a wedding dress, standing out among the black robes. He stood up straight, half opening his mouth.
0:22:53|0:23:1|Qi Jia lowered her arm, tears streaming down her face. In a hospital that combined Eastern and Western medicine, the [Doctor] was giving a lecture.
0:24:25|0:24:40|[Yuan Xiaoou] came back with a cactus, placed it on the table, and pushed it in front of the [doctor]. The doctor recoiled in fear. As [Yuan Xiaoou] left, he quickly threw the cactus into the trash can. Lou Tianya sat down elegantly, while Lin Shuer poured red wine gracefully.
0:25:10|0:25:25|[Yuan Xiaoou] points to Ling Shuer, standing still as she leaves, the alley at night is quiet and warm. [Qi Jia] sits on the window sill in the bedroom, swinging her legs outside, holding onto the top of the window frame with both hands, closing her eyes and breathing in the outdoor air in a drunken state.
0:25:25|0:25:31|[Yuan Xiaoou] returned with bags in hand, looked up to see dangling legs, waiting for the moment of release.
0:26:10|0:26:18|The passerby invited by Wensheng gathered at the entrance of the alley, while [Yuan Xiaoou] rushed into the house and ran into [Qi Jia]'s bedroom, closing the windows.
0:26:24|0:26:26|[Yuan Xiaoou]'s hand resting on [Qi Jia]'s shoulder hangs in midair.
0:27:0|0:27:8|[Yuan Xiaoou] covered one eye, blood dripping from her nose, walked out the door. She stopped at a barbecue stand by the road.
0:27:51|0:27:55|[Yuan Xiaoou] quickly comforted [Qi Jia] to sit down and pressed down the bottle of wine she picked up.
0:28:18|0:28:26|Yuan Xiaoou took the grilled meat handed by the waiter, then pressed the wine in Qi Jia's hand, handed him a skewer of chicken wings, and then picked up another skewer herself.
0:28:30|0:28:40|[Qi Jia] took a bite and immediately started talking. [Yuan Xiaoou] quickly signaled the waiter to stop talking. She then persuaded [Qi Jia] to sit down.
0:28:55|0:29:9|[Qi Jia] picked up a bottle of wine and smashed it on the table twice. Seeing that the bottle didn't break, she then aimed to smash it on [Yuan Xiaoou]'s head. The bottle broke halfway, and [Qi Jia] walked towards the waiter. [Yuan Xiaoou] hugged [Qi Jia] around the waist.
0:29:17|0:29:37|[Yuan Xiaoou] dragged [Qi Jia] to the roadside and stuffed him into a taxi. The taxi sped away. The car almost hit a group of burly men with round tattoos on their waists, who were heading towards a barbecue stall. [Yuan Xiaoou] hurriedly rushed ahead of them and walked into the store.
0:29:39|0:29:49|He imitated the tattooed man's posture and swaggered towards the waiter. The waiter panicked. [Yuan Xiaoou] adjusted his waistband and spoke to the waiter.
0:30:15|0:30:18|The waiter quickly sat up and squatted down in place.
0:30:25|0:30:48|The waitress sat down and squatted, smiling at the table with the tattoo. [Yuan Xiaoou] whistled as she walked into the alley, only to see Qi Jia leaning against the wall, drunk. [Yuan Xiaoou] rushed forward, clumsily embracing him, while Qi Jia let him manipulate like a puppet.
0:30:51|0:31:0|[Yuan Xiaoou] cheered on and lifted [Qi Jia] horizontally. Another night, [Qi Jia] leaned drunkenly against the wall again, and [Yuan Xiaoou] rushed over.
0:31:1|0:31:3|The delivery guy at the door asked.
0:31:22|0:31:25|[Yuan Xiaoou] took the pen and signed.
0:31:31|0:31:39|[Qi Jia] snatched the package from under [Yuan Xiaoou]'s armpit. She looked unsteady as she stared at the cardboard box.
0:31:50|0:32:6|[Qi Jia] swayed back and forth, rubbing her chest, pointed at the words "Liu Chong" on the box, and hugged the box to her chest. [Qi Jia] opened the door and walked into the building, while [Yuan Xiaoou] hung her head in sorrow and anger.
0:32:15|0:32:18|[Qi Jia] sat cross-legged at the head of the bed, tears streaming down her face.
0:32:37|0:32:45|The next day, [Qi Jia] was lying quietly in a bed of petals, wearing a vintage chiffon dress and holding a crystal ball in her hand.
0:32:48|0:33:0|In the early morning, in the deserted alley, [Yuan Xiaoou] is holding [Qi Jia] and running like crazy. [Qi Jia]'s slender arms hang behind her waist, like a doll that could break at any moment.
0:33:0|0:33:20|Passersby on the street turned to look at them, [Yuan Xiaoou] quickly disappeared at the end of the road. In a single patient room, [Lin Shuer] walked to the screen, and [Qi Jia] lying on the bed couldn't help but press her stomach, watching her close her eyes and gasp lightly. [Lin Shuer] sat down, leaned over the bed and said.
0:33:34|0:33:39|[Ling Shuer] looked away speechlessly, then turned back to persuade him.
0:33:45|0:33:50|[Ling Shuer] frowned slightly, and finally asked the long-hidden question in her heart.
0:33:56|0:34:1|Qi Jia's head turned to the side, with her back facing Ex-Boyfriend who was about to sleep. Bestie walked around to the front of Qi Jia.
0:34:9|0:34:15|Qi Jia's tears slid into her ears, and she recounted her emotional journey.
0:34:23|0:34:27|She still didn't look at [Lin Shuer], remained silent for a few seconds, then continued.
0:34:32|0:34:37|[Yuan Xiaoou] pushed the door open and walked quietly to [Qi Jia]'s bedside.
0:35:14|0:35:25|[Qi Jia] turned her head and looked at the ceiling. Lin Shuer and [Yuan Xiaoou] shouted at the same time, but went in opposite directions, the scenery outside the car window receding.
0:35:31|0:35:50|[Qi Jia] saw [Yuan Xiaoou] turn her head and immediately glared back. The sports car drove onto the coastal highway, with the fishing boats outside the car window quickly disappearing into the greenery, while the setting sun half-dyed the sea surface with shimmering gold.
0:35:51|0:36:5|In the outskirts villa, the rapeseed flowers are in full bloom. Lin Shuer parked the car on the small road in the flower field. As soon as the car stopped, [Qi Jia] opened the back door and quickly walked towards the flowers. Lin Shuer followed, getting out of the car and calling out.
0:36:11|0:36:13|Yuan Xiaoou gets out of the car, and Lin Shuer scolds.
0:36:27|0:36:47|[Qi Jia] and Lin Shuer ran to the depths of the flower field, looked around, then squatted down. The flower field was quiet, as if no one had ever been there. After a while, the two lightly touched the half-height rapeseed flowers, leisurely strolling and spinning in the flower field, happily walking out of the flower field hand in hand.
0:36:47|0:36:54|The car drove to the entrance of a farmhouse by a small bridge and stream. In no time, the three of them were sitting in the yard having dinner.
0:37:22|0:37:39|[Lin Shuer] immediately grabs the meat. [Qi Jia] borrows a tablet, and on the screen is a wedding dress off the rails.
0:38:30|0:38:38|On a rainy night, [Lin Shuer] fell asleep in the passenger seat, while [Yuan Xiaoou] continued to drive. [Qi Jia] remembered what [Liu Chong] had said.
0:39:26|0:39:28|The two of them stood across from each other in silence, separated by the bushes.
0:39:41|0:40:7|[Liu Chong] glanced at the dormitory building, then turned and walked away. [Qi Jia] also left in a huff, memories fading. Leaning against the car window, [Qi Jia] silently shed tears, his profile illuminated by the street lamp, tears shimmering faintly. Catching a glimpse of [Qi Jia]'s expression in the rearview mirror, [Yuan Xiaoou] quickly grabbed a tissue and handed it over. [Qi Jia] smiled faintly.
0:40:7|0:40:24|Quietly closing her eyes, [Yuan Xiaoou] pursed her lips, reluctantly retracting the tissue. She glanced at the roadside, turned the steering wheel to the right, and the car, flashing its lights, stopped under the street lamp. The torrential rain beating down on the car made it almost impossible to see the person inside.
0:40:24|0:40:34|[Yuan Xiaoou] lowered her head to unbuckle her seatbelt, turned towards the back seat, extended her arm, and wiped away [Qi Jia]'s tears. She carefully used a tissue to dab at the corner of [Qi Jia]'s eye.
0:41:45|0:41:48|[Liu Chong] leaned back on the sofa, looking relieved.
0:42:29|0:42:49|In the hotel room, [Qi Jia] closed the door after receiving a large package. On the floor inside the room, there was an opened gift box. [Qi Jia] stood in front of the mirror in a shirt and jeans, holding a sectioned wedding dress against her body, comparing it, and then hugging it close.
0:42:49|0:42:57|On the grass outside a Gothic Catholic church, guests chatted in small groups, while [Liu Chong] in formal attire greeted the guests.
0:42:59|0:43:9|In the room, [Yuan Xiaoou] is trying on a shirt in front of the mirror, then puts on a slightly tight groomsman suit. [Lin Shuer] is wearing a sleeveless dress, looking around in the corridor.
0:43:20|0:43:31|A bright Maserati convertible parked in front of the church, [Lin Shuer] hurried forward to open the door. With her face covered by a veil, [Qi Jia] stepped out of the car and whispered.
0:43:43|0:43:45|[Qi Jia] and Lin Shuer walked into the church side by side.
0:43:55|0:44:3|Ling Shuer elegantly escorts [Qi Jia] to Liu Chong's side. Liu Chong extends his arm to [Qi Jia], and when she links arms with him, he senses something amiss and asks.
0:44:6|0:44:11|[Qi Jia] kept her head down and remained silent, only focusing on walking forward, while [Yuan Xiaoou] clapped with a stern expression.
0:44:32|0:44:48|[Qi Jia] turned her face to the side, remaining silent for a long time. Liu Chong's smile gradually disappeared, while [Yuan Xiaoou] and Lin Shuer nervously watched from the sides. Suddenly, [Qi Jia] lifted her veil and turned towards Liu Chong.
0:45:34|0:45:38|Liu Chong looked at [Qi Jia] with a complicated expression, and [Qi Jia] turned her head to look down the aisle.
0:45:38|0:45:59|He also turned around to look, and the guests in their seats all turned their heads. The real bride, wearing the exact same wedding dress as [Qi Jia], slowly walked over. [Qi Jia] looked flustered and glanced at [Yuan Xiaoou]. He had a cold expression. [Qi Jia] then looked at Lin Shuer, who was full of concern. [Qi Jia] looked at Liu Chong, who appeared worried and anxious. Tears filled [Qi Jia]'s eyes.
0:45:59|0:46:5|In the blink of an eye, they fell down one after another in a rush. Finally, he lifted the hem of the skirt and ran towards the church door as if escaping.
0:46:21|0:46:26|[Qi Jia] passed by the bride, and the guests' eyes followed [Qi Jia] as she ran out of the church.
0:46:28|0:46:41|Yuan Xiaoou made a tough statement and then followed Lin Shuer out. The guests' attention returned to Xingyun in front of them. Liu Chong held the bride's hand tightly, and the two watched as Yuan Xiaoou and the others disappeared at the door.
0:46:55|0:47:18|You only know how to fall and bleed, Qi Jia is lying in the bathtub in a wedding dress, soulless, letting the water from the shower wash over her, the night in Beijing is lit up with countless lights, and the traffic flows like branches.
0:47:19|0:47:39|In the kitchen at home, [Qi Jia] pulls open the latticed curtain of the cupboard, revealing transparent sealed jars storing various grains. He carefully inspects the gaps between the jars, but finds nothing. [Qi Jia] then opens the lower cabinet, where a pile of hazelnuts and canned purple rice porridge are stored. After closing the cabinet door, he pulls open a drawer.
0:47:42|0:47:57|Qi Jia squinted one eye and leaned in to look inside, only to find cold spatulas and knives in the drawer. [Yuan Xiaoou] heard the noise and came out, seeing her crouching in the kitchen and asked.
0:49:15|0:49:35|[Yuan Xiaoou] was scared by Qi Jia's gaze and quickly shut her mouth. Qi Jia was lying on the bed with a fish tank in her arms, sleeping soundly. The floor was a mess, with items scattered everywhere. [Yuan Xiaoou] made a makeshift bed on the floor and slept among the clutter, while a little turtle slowly crawled past her.
0:49:35|0:49:41|In the early morning, [Yuan Xiaoou] was cooking chicken soup and chopping vegetables, while tilting her head and holding her phone to call Lin Shuer.
0:50:11|0:50:21|Qi Jia rushed into the bathroom with both hands raised, then turned back and excitedly shouted at [Yuan Xiaoou]. Another day, [Yuan Xiaoou] saw Qi Jia pacing back and forth in the living room, and asked in confusion.
0:50:41|0:50:47|[Yuan Xiaoou] grabbed Qi Jia and quickly brought a bowl of soup from the kitchen to her.
0:50:54|0:50:58|[Yuan Xiaoou] bowed respectfully and pleaded, as Qi Jia turned around and spoke.
0:51:24|0:51:34|[Yuan Xiaoou] walked back to the bedroom alone and vomited the medicine she had just drunk into the flowerpot. In the living room, Qi Jia was about to drink her beverage when [Yuan Xiaoou] squatted in front of her and pushed all the snacks on the coffee table off.
0:51:41|0:51:44|She handed him a few pieces of sushi with a tablet.
0:53:1|0:53:8|Qi Jia did it, yes, all the bones and muscles in the body have been fully relaxed.
0:53:34|0:53:49|[Qi Jia] gradually fell asleep under the nanny-like coaxing of [Yuan Xiaoou]. The next day, [Qi Jia] slowly opened her eyes in the gentle light. She sat up energetically, only to be startled by [Yuan Xiaoou] sitting at the end of the bed, causing her to make a funny expression. [Qi Jia] frowned and scolded.
0:54:21|0:54:30|[Yuan Xiaoou] grabbed Qingxia's arm and helped her do ineffective sit-ups.
0:54:56|0:55:20|[Qi Jia] walked out of the room in a professional suit, putting on a small suit jacket in front of the mirror. He walked to the dining table where a prominent note was placed, saying, "Darling, remember to take your medicine after the meal." Not only that, [Yuan Xiaoou] prepared a lovingly packed lunchbox for him every morning, and [Qi Jia] smiled faintly as he looked at it.
0:55:20|0:55:35|[Yuan Xiaoou] dragged [Qi Jia] to run by the river. The cinema was packed, everyone was wearing 3D glasses and watching attentively. [Yuan Xiaoou] kept eating popcorn from the bucket, licking her fingers and focusing her gaze on [Qi Jia]'s hands.
0:55:36|0:55:53|[Yuan Xiaoou] was about to hold hands with [Qi Jia], when suddenly a strong wind blew in the cinema, causing the seats to shake violently, creating a very realistic environment effect. However, [Yuan Xiaoou] was left in a mess by the popcorn in her arms, and could only silently put the remaining popcorn back into the bucket.
0:55:53|0:56:10|[Qi Jia] looked at her awkward expression and burst out laughing. In the beauty salon, [Qi Jia] was wearing a traditional Chinese acupuncture gown and lying in a private room getting a mud mask. [Yuan Xiaoou] was lying on the sofa in the back area, fast asleep. As she turned her head, the impurities on her face fell off.
0:56:10|0:56:13|[Qi Jia] took the opportunity to apply a facial mask on [Yuan Xiaoou], giving her a big flower face.
0:56:24|0:56:50|[Yuan Xiaoou] stood up and suddenly saw the mirror in the shop window. [Qi Jia] hurriedly slipped away, [Yuan Xiaoou] quickly chased after. On the balcony, [Yuan Xiaoou] put the washed clothes into a basin, and as she was about to leave, she sensed something was wrong. She slowly looked down and was shocked.
0:57:13|0:57:18|[Qi Jia] couldn't accept that the turtle had the same name as her. She looked at [Yuan Xiaoou] and squeezed out a sentence after a long time.
0:57:26|0:57:33|At this age, [Qi Jia] is in her prime in the world of female friends, and what she eats is not so important to her.
0:57:40|0:57:45|On the beach, [Qi Jia] is wearing a coat, paired with shorts.
0:57:48|0:58:7|The two of them sat on the beach, laughing and joking. [Qi Jia] used a marker to write the words "流冲" on the turtle's back. [Yuan Xiaoou] took a photo of [Qi Jia] and the turtle.
0:58:19|0:58:32|[Qi Jia] was bitten on the upper lip by a turtle. [Qi Jia] waved goodbye to the turtle with a golden hand, and [Yuan Xiaoou] threw it hard. The turtle flew in an arc in the air before falling into the sea.
0:58:34|0:58:39|"Little turtle," [Yuan Xiaoou] saw the situation and quickly shouted to imitate him for a while.
0:58:51|0:58:53|[Qi Jia] ran up to the turtle and asked.
0:59:1|0:59:10|[Yuan Xiaoou] exerted all her strength and threw the turtle back into the sea. [Qi Jia] took a few steps forward and turned back, the little turtle appeared again.
0:59:28|0:59:42|[Qi Jia] covered her face with a scarf, and the two of them shyly lowered their heads and walked away. [Yuan Xiaoou] suddenly pointed at [Qi Jia] and then burst into laughter.
0:59:45|1:0:2|[Qi Jia] turned around, his upper lip swollen in a comical way. With half of his swollen mouth open, [Yuan Xiaoou] couldn't help but laugh and squat down. The two of them arrived at the lake in the park, and [Yuan Xiaoou] held a turtle, looking at [Qi Jia] with questioning eyes.
1:0:2|1:0:6|After getting confirmation, [Yuan Xiaoou] slowly placed the little turtle on the water surface.
1:0:17|1:0:20|Ling Shuer observed [Qi Jia] from the outdoor VIP seat.
1:1:35|1:1:39|In front of the health-preserving Chinese medicine counter, Guijie professionally introduces [Qi Jia] and Lin Shuer.
1:1:44|1:2:0|In a jewelry store in the mall, [Yuan Xiaoou] bought a diamond ring, with the salesperson wearing gloves waiting on the side. [Yuan Xiaoou] picked up the ring, took a glance at it, didn't even take the gift box, and walked out of the store. As she walked, she carefully held the diamond ring, putting it into her pocket.
1:2:8|1:2:18|In another shopping mall, the female CEO in an exquisite houndstooth suit walked towards the mall entrance. [Yuan Xiaoou] happened to park her car at the door, and she quickly got out of the car to open the passenger door for General Li.
1:2:23|1:2:38|[Yuan Xiaoou] reached out to protect President Li's head, and after President Li elegantly sat down, she quickly ran back to the driver's seat. President Li put on his sunglasses, fastened his seatbelt, and [Yuan Xiaoou] started the car and drove away. Inside the mall entrance, Qi Jia and Lin Shuer hurriedly chased after them.
1:2:49|1:2:55|[Qi Jia] frowned slightly, looking uneasy. Inside a high-end restaurant, [Yuan Xiaoou] took the menu from the waiter.
1:4:29|1:4:32|[Qi Jia] blinked and put down the fork.
1:4:36|1:4:38|Lin Shuer glanced at [Qi Jia].
1:4:42|1:5:7|[Yuan Xiaoou] looked absent-minded, with yogurt smeared on her lips. Lin Shuer let out a soft sigh. [Yuan Xiaoou] touched the Eiffel Tower-shaped diamond ring in her hand, silently putting it back into her pocket. In the Bay Park, [Yuan Xiaoou] pushed [Qi Jia] to run. The two of them ran into the campus.
1:5:13|1:5:37|[Qi Jia]'s gaze was firmly locked on the ancient tree by the roadside. [Qi Jia] stared at the ancient tree, where he had his first kiss with Liu Chong. [Yuan Xiaoou]'s gaze began to dodge. [Yuan Xiaoou] pulled [Qi Jia] towards the tree.
1:6:5|1:6:12|[Yuan Xiaoou] slowly approached [Qi Jia], her hands resting on the tree trunk, gently and tenderly kissing [Qi Jia]'s lips.
1:6:13|1:6:27|[Qi Jia] suddenly opened her eyes, her eyeballs darting around in confusion, while tree branches gently swayed in the warm breeze. Before long, [Qi Jia] closed her eyes again, her tense body gradually relaxing, immersing herself in this elongated moment.
1:6:27|1:6:37|The students sketching nearby stood quietly in front of their easels, watching the tender lovers under the tree. [Qi Jia] blinked, turned her face to the side, and ended the kiss.
1:6:38|1:6:54|He looked up at [Yuan Xiaoou], pushed away her arm beside him, and walked away from the ancient tree alone. When [Yuan Xiaoou] came to her senses, she quickly caught up. The sunlight shone through the treetops, and the flickering light seemed like a faint diamond hanging on the tree.
1:6:56|1:7:12|[Qi Jia] walked briskly with her hands in her pockets under the continuous canopy of trees, with [Yuan Xiaoou] silently following closely behind. The lush tree crowns above them connected, blocking the sky completely, and the light followed their footsteps, jumping through the gaps between the branches.
1:7:12|1:7:33|[Qi Jia] and [Yuan Xiaoou] briskly walk across the campus, with lush greenery on the small hill. [Qi Jia] puts her hands in her pockets, occasionally looking back to make sure [Yuan Xiaoou] is following behind. [Yuan Xiaoou] foolishly imitates him by putting his hands in his pockets and looking back. The two walk to the bridge by the river, [Qi Jia] casually stretches her arms, and [Yuan Xiaoou] behind her follows suit.
1:7:33|1:7:48|The two figures disappeared on the other side of the bridge, as the tranquil lake was suddenly hit by a heavy rain. The fine raindrops created ripples on the entire lake, and mist quickly enveloped the area under the bridge. The rain became even more intense after a muffled thunder.
1:7:48|1:8:0|The students sketching by the river were caught off guard and drenched, they quickly grabbed their palettes, picked up their drawing boards and easels, and fled from the exposed embankment. Meanwhile, [Qi Jia] and [Yuan Xiaoou] strode forward along the riverbank.
1:8:5|1:8:16|[Qi Jia] crossed the street without looking back, while [Yuan Xiaoou] followed her cautiously with her coat half-raised. Lin Shuer saw them from the car.
1:8:22|1:8:32|[Qi Jia] saw Lin Shuer looking out of the car window and immediately ran to the side of the car. After a moment of daze, [Yuan Xiaoou] lifted up her clothes and chased after, and the two of them sat in the back seat of the car one after the other.
1:8:38|1:8:46|The two glanced at each other, then quickly looked away, creating an awkward atmosphere. Lin Shuer immediately sensed something was wrong and turned to illuminate the expressions of the two.
1:9:10|1:9:21|Lin Shuer opened the umbrella and pushed open the car door. Outside, there was thunder and lightning, heavy rain pouring down. The water flooded up to his ankles. He stretched out his long legs, placed them in front of the car, and kicked it hard.
1:9:24|1:9:35|It seems that without resolving the grudge, he kicked again before moving on. Inside the car, [Yuan Xiaoou] turned to look at [Qi Jia], who quickly avoided eye contact. He broke the silence first and instructed.
1:9:41|1:9:46|[Qi Jia] nodded. He thought for a moment and continued.
1:9:53|1:10:3|The atmosphere froze again. [Yuan Xiaoou] swallowed and [Qi Jia] spoke. [Yuan Xiaoou] widened her eyes and took a deep breath.
1:10:9|1:10:13|[Yuan Xiaoou] smiled foolishly, and a smile also appeared on [Qi Jia]'s face.
1:10:14|1:10:23|[Qi Jia] looked at [Yuan Xiaoou] with determination, as a smile spread across Yuan Xiaoou's face. The rainwater seeped into the car, soaking their feet without them realizing.
1:10:33|1:10:35|Lin Shuer stood in the water and made a phone call.
1:10:47|1:10:53|The rain was beating down on the car roof, [Qi Jia] feeling a bit anxious. When [Yuan Xiaoou] tried to open the car door, she found it locked, and a sense of unease washed over her.
1:11:7|1:11:9|The water outside the car has risen to the level of the windows.
1:11:37|1:11:43|Lin Shuer's [Ex-Boyfriend] is lying on the roof of the car, and unexpectedly floats in front of Lin Shuer. Inside the car, [Qi Jia] is lying on top of the water.
1:12:9|1:12:18|Lin Shuer and [Ex-Boyfriend] continued to argue over the phone, and [Yuan Xiaoou] couldn't reach his phone no matter how many times she tried. She had no choice but to leave him a voicemail.
1:12:55|1:13:4|[Qi Jia] waved her hands aimlessly in the air, with her legs curled up to her chest. She reached out and pushed away [Yuan Xiaoou].
1:13:12|1:13:21|[Qi Jia] kept staring straight ahead, not hearing a response for a while. He then turned his head to look at [Yuan Xiaoou], who was sitting in the water without moving.
1:13:25|1:13:30|[Qi Jia] realized what [Yuan Xiaoou] was doing, rushed over and pried open her mouth, but [Yuan Xiaoou] kept her mouth tightly shut.
1:13:38|1:13:41|[Yuan Xiaoou] finally couldn't hold it in and gasped for air.
1:13:45|1:13:52|[Qi Jia] leaned back against the car window, sitting upright against the door, the two of them locking eyes. [Yuan Xiaoou] wiped her face and leaned in towards [Qi Jia].
1:13:54|1:14:0|He cradled [Qi Jia]'s face, rested his forehead against hers, and weakly spoke the words that had been weighing on his heart.
1:14:4|1:14:8|The cold and lack of oxygen made [Yuan Xiaoou] shiver all over.
1:14:10|1:14:16|[Qi Jia] couldn't help but smile and opened her arms to hug [Yuan Xiaoou], who immediately embraced her gently.
1:14:22|1:14:27|Lin Shuer belatedly realized that her car was missing, so she hung up the phone and opened a messaging app.
1:14:33|1:14:49|Ling Shuer suddenly turned around and walked towards the car with difficulty. At this moment, inside the car, [Qi Jia] and [Yuan Xiaoou] were tightly embracing each other. Several firefighters and [Ling Shuer] rushed towards the car, and [Ling Shuer] simply threw away the umbrella, jumping to the window.
1:14:49|1:14:53|The firefighter comforted them loudly, and [Qi Jia] and [Yuan Xiaoou] were finally rescued.
1:14:54|1:15:11|At midnight, the rain has stopped, and the water from the alley flows down from above. [Qi Jia] and [Yuan Xiaoou] walk side by side up the steps of the alley, heading towards home. The street lamp illuminates their faces, [Yuan Xiaoou] looks down, but can't hide the smile at the corner of her mouth.
1:15:11|1:15:22|[Qi Jia] wrapped herself in [Yuan Xiaoou]'s coat, hugging her arms tightly, looking both mysterious and somewhat aloof. Soon, the two of them arrived at the residential building. [Yuan Xiaoou] watched [Qi Jia]'s back and softly called out to her.
1:15:25|1:15:27|[Qi Jia], [Qi Jia] turned around.
1:15:35|1:15:40|[Qi Jia] listened, lowered her head to think for a moment, then raised it and replied.
1:15:44|1:15:54|[Yuan Xiaoou] stood still, looking at [Qi Jia] for a long time with many feelings in his eyes. Seeing him remain silent, [Qi Jia] reached out to open the small iron gate of the residential building and walked in.
1:15:55|1:16:14|[Yuan Xiaoou] stood alone at the door for a while, then walked into the building as if appointed, closing the iron gate behind her. In the narrow alleyway, rainwater collected in foam boxes, and the lane returned to silence. The next day, with the gentle breeze fluttering the curtains, [Qi Jia] naturally woke up in the white noise of the city.
1:16:14|1:16:33|She sat up, feeling an indescribable change in her body. [Qi Jia] was momentarily stunned, gently exhaled, and her eyes cleverly darted around. He looked down at his abdomen and immediately shouted. There was no response.
1:16:33|1:16:39|[Qi Jia] shouted as she got up to check, rushing to the door of [Yuan Xiaoou]'s bedroom, only to find a letter lying on the floor in front of the door.
1:16:41|1:17:2|[Qi Jia] squatted down, picked up the letter with a blank envelope. Standing up, [Qi Jia] opened the letter along the creases. At the same time, the phone on the bedside table of [Qi Jia] rang. The screen displayed a voice call invitation from a messaging app, and the caller was [Yuan Xiaoou].
1:17:2|1:17:8|[Qi Jia] cautiously pressed the answer button, and [Yuan Xiaoou]'s voice came through.
1:17:58|1:18:4|[Qi Jia] opened the drawer in the kitchen, and all the knives were wrapped in floral-patterned paper by [Yuan Xiaoou].
1:18:32|1:18:53|[Yuan Xiaoou] placed the cactus on the windowsill before leaving, sighing with loneliness. Now, [Qi Jia] came to the window, and the cactus bloomed delicate flowers. As she reached out to touch them, her finger was pricked by a thorn. She looked at the blood oozing from her fingertip, smiling and speaking as if this represented a rebirth of her body.
1:18:54|1:19:12|In the neighborhood, [Qi Jia] crossed the road diagonally, but didn't notice a large truck honking not far away. The truck stopped steadily behind him. Startled, [Qi Jia] stood still, then moved to the side of the road to let the truck pass, and the truck rushed away.
1:19:13|1:19:35|Qi Jia noticed a huge poster of a painting exhibition on the face of [Ludun]. He walked up to examine it carefully, and the main subject of the poster was a painting of an ancient tree. Below it, it read, "Facing the sea, warm spring blossoms, the 10th Xiamen City Primary and Secondary School Students' Sketch Exhibition." Qi Jia walked through the exhibition hall, carefully looking at the paintings displayed on the walls.
1:19:35|1:19:39|Suddenly, his eyes became puzzled as he leaned in closely to a painting.
1:19:41|1:19:58|The painting depicts a couple kissing under a huge ancient tree. He looks a bit surprised, walks on to see the next piece of work, only to find that every painting below shows a short-haired girl and a boy kissing under a tree. The entire corridor is filled with this scene.
1:19:59|1:20:16|[Qi Jia] looked at these paintings, tears unknowingly filling her eyes. She stood quietly in the corner, large tears streaming down her face. In front of her, the girl in the painting closed her eyes, she knew that the painting depicted herself and [Yuan Xiaoou].
1:20:16|1:20:25|[Qi Jia] could no longer suppress the sadness, as if awakened, she looked at the painting in front of her. She lowered her head, memories flooding in, all of them about [Yuan Xiaoou].
1:21:6|1:21:11|Qi Jia walked towards the exit of the exhibition hall, leaving behind the replica of Yuan Xiaoou and her memories.
1:21:32|1:21:47|[Yuan Xiaoou] escorted the foreign client into the elevator, her expression immediately relaxed. She walked into the company, members stood up eagerly watching her as she entered. Colleagues from all directions came over to surround her, she scratched her head and stood still.
1:21:59|1:22:6|The crowd cheered and gathered in groups to celebrate. [Yuan Xiaoou], however, turned around and answered a phone call.
1:23:1|1:23:19|The irritable [Yuan Xiaoou] scared all the colleagues around her. A luxurious SUV abruptly stopped at the entrance of the hospital, and [Yuan Xiaoou] got out of the car and rushed into the hospital lobby. She hurried to the information desk to inquire, but her attention was drawn to a slender short-haired girl not far away.
1:23:19|1:23:23|The girl with short hair stood in the sparse crowd, looking at something, then lowered her head and walked away.
1:23:24|1:23:40|The glass curtain wall in the lobby reflected the empty scene of the hospital, as well as the figure of the girl with short hair. The girl with short hair took the elevator to the second floor, and [Yuan Xiaoou] immediately followed. She ran onto the elevator, taking three steps at a time to rush to the second floor.
1:23:40|1:23:48|Wearing a hospital gown, the short-haired woman touched her neck and walked to the front desk of the inpatient department. [Yuan Xiaoou] was about to catch up with her, but stopped in her tracks.
1:23:49|1:24:8|The hospital lobby was bustling with people, most of whom were patients wearing the same hospital gowns as the short-haired woman. [Yuan Xiaoou] gazed at the back of the woman who resembled her, following her at a distance. When the short-haired woman glanced back slightly and turned right into a small garden, [Yuan Xiaoou] followed suit.
1:24:8|1:24:40|Her gaze followed the short-haired woman as she sat down, while she herself walked towards her step by step. [Yuan Xiaoou] squatted down in front of her with a look of pity in her eyes. Qi Jia, the short-haired woman, stopped her hand from lighting a cigarette, which was then taken away by [Yuan Xiaoou]. [Yuan Xiaoou] fiddled with her ears and spoke in Korean.
1:24:42|1:24:56|The short-haired woman still looked at him askance, shaking her head in disagreement. [Yuan Xiaoou] said dejectedly. She stared into the short-haired woman's eyes, then bowed her head in remorse.
1:25:16|1:25:32|Qi Jia's voice suddenly sounded. [Yuan Xiaoou] turned around, and Qi Jia was right behind her. Qi Jia suppressed a smile, looking at [Yuan Xiaoou]. [Yuan Xiaoou] looked at the Qi Jia in front of her, unable to speak for a moment.
1:25:47|1:26:3|Qi Jia had barely finished speaking when [Yuan Xiaoou] pulled her in, fiercely pressing her lips against hers. Qi Jia wrapped her arms tightly around [Yuan Xiaoou]'s waist, closing her eyes and getting lost in this delicate moment.
1:26:4|1:26:17|[Yuan Xiaoou] wrapped one arm around Qi Jia's waist, while the other hand supported the back of her head, kissing her deeply. Their lips intertwined, with [Yuan Xiaoou] pressing against Qi Jia's forehead before pursing her lips and standing up straight.
1:26:18|1:26:30|[Yuan Xiaoou] couldn't help but shed some tears, with [Qi Jia] also tearing up. [Yuan Xiaoou] rummaged through his pockets, then the vest pocket, and pulled out the diamond ring he had bought a year ago.
1:26:39|1:27:1|[Qi Jia] looked at the ring in front of her, fidgeting as she apologized. [Yuan Xiaoou] knelt down, took [Qi Jia]'s hand. [Qi Jia] looked nervously and moved by [Yuan Xiaoou], her eyes filled with tenderness, choked up and said.
1:27:4|1:27:22|[Yuan Xiaoou] devoutly places the ring on the ring finger of [Qi Jia]'s left hand, the miniature Eiffel Tower on the ring shining brightly. [Qi Jia] instantly bursts into tears, covering her mouth to stifle a cry, and is then tightly embraced by [Yuan Xiaoou], the two closing their eyes and holding each other tightly, unable to help but laugh sweetly.
1:27:22|1:27:31|[Yuan Xiaoou] spins around in place with [Qi Jia], the two of them seeking a good reputation, laughing happily and brightly. The screen fades to black, directed by Guo Zairong.
1:27:53|1:28:7|On the day of graduation, [Yuan Xiaoou] sat among the graduates in the audience, witnessing the entire proposal process of [Qi Jia]. Ling Shuer helped [Qi Jia] out of the auditorium, and like her classmates around her, she watched [Qi Jia] leave. She bit her finger, feeling deeply affected.
1:28:33|1:28:54|A group of guys asked the auntie in charge of the girls' dormitory to let them in, but they were all stopped by the auntie at the stairs. The drunken [Yuan Xiaoou] crawled into the main room on the ground and made her way to Qi Jia's dormitory door. As she was about to knock, she realized the door was not closed and she fell to the ground.
1:29:3|1:29:19|[Yuan Xiaoou] pushed herself up from the ground, while Lao Bai quietly climbed onto Qi Jia's bed and reached out a hand to pull [Yuan Xiaoou] onto the bed.
