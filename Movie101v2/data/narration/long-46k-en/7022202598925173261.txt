0:2:6|0:2:19|Yuan Shuai then staggered up the stairs on the side, a white beast appeared in the alley. He ran to the rooftop and hid behind a large potted banana tree, crouching with his head in his hands. He cautiously observed his surroundings while stealthily bending over on the balcony filled with hanging clothes.
0:2:19|0:2:26|The shadow of a beast is imprinted on the hanging sheets, [Yuan Shuai] suddenly quickens his pace, pushing aside the dense sheets on the rooftop and running forward.
0:2:26|0:2:37|He suddenly stopped in his tracks, eyes wide with fear, gritting his teeth as he turned back to look, trying to grab the clothesline. Unexpectedly, the rope broke, and he swung his arms, falling off the rooftop along with the debris.
0:3:8|0:3:18|As soon as the words fell, the neon sign "The Second Generation Fairy: This Life is Lucky" appeared on the top floor. The time goes back to 36 hours ago,
0:5:2|0:5:10|[Yuan Shuai] walked away quickly after speaking, and the rich woman threw a spoon at the back of [Yuan Shuai]'s head. He stopped, turned around, and the spoon, covered in cream, slid off his hair. He approached the rich woman.
0:5:18|0:5:24|The rich woman sat down in fear on the chair, [Yuan Shuai] raised the cream cake and glared at her fiercely, while other customers in the western restaurant were all watching them.
0:5:24|0:5:41|The scene shifts to the bustling metropolis, with landmarks such as the Shanghai Center, the Global Financial Center, the Golden Trade Building, and the Oriental Pearl Tower coming into view. [Yuan Shuai], dressed in a smart suit, holds a cake and walks up the overpass with heavy steps, brushing past hurried pedestrians.
0:5:41|0:5:48|In the center of Shanghai, skyscrapers stand tall, intertwined with old-fashioned small Western-style buildings full of local flavor.
0:5:50|0:6:1|[Yuan Shuai] walked into a bustling alley, where the atmosphere was filled with a strong sense of the common people. Some people were sitting in front of food stalls eating, while others were tending to the plants in flower pots. As he passed by a wonton shop,
0:6:1|0:6:16|A girl in a white dress with long flowing hair sits on the windowsill of the second floor, one leg dangling outside, her gaze following [Yuan Shuai].
0:6:31|0:6:46|Along the way, he passed by Lion Mountain, walked onto a small bridge, and under the bridge, there was a huge golden koi swimming freely in the river. After crossing the bridge, he opened the door restricted to employees only. As he walked on, he seemed to hear some strange sound again, gradually stopping his steps and looking back.
0:6:46|0:6:55|Just now, the girl in white appeared again, she was lying on the glass roof above his head, [Yuan Shuai] turned his head, and the girl quickly curled up and hid.
0:6:56|0:7:12|As the sky darkens, [Yuan Shuai] walks towards the house covered in vines, opens the iron gate, and walks in carrying a cake. [Yuan Shuai] changes from a suit to work clothes, picks up a shovel to scoop up the feed on the ground and in the pool into a cart, then pushes the cart filled with feed outside a iron fence where an elephant is kept, dumping the feed on the ground.
0:7:12|0:7:23|The elephant raised its trunk to signal to [Yuan Shuai], who also friendly chirped at the elephant before slowly walking away with the cart. Just a few steps later, he sensed something was amiss and turned his head back suspiciously.
0:7:23|0:7:39|He quickly turned his eyes, then suddenly squatted down and looked into the half-pulled curtain door on the other side, but found nothing. His phone suddenly rang, he took out his phone and wiped his fingers clean on his work clothes.
0:7:57|0:8:9|[Yuan Shuai] is tidying up in the shabby room, putting on a shirt and vest, and even tying a delicate bow tie. Suddenly, his father, who suffers from delusional disorder, calls for a video chat.
0:8:52|0:9:4|[Yuan Shuai] saw his father fainting on the screen, being supported by a nurse. He furrowed his brows gradually, with a vacant expression, slowly putting down his phone. After the call ended, the scene shifted to outside a coffee shop, with sunlight shining on the sign of the shop.
0:9:5|0:9:20|[Yuan Shuai] arrived at the caf√© for a blind date as scheduled, enthusiastically taking photos of a Garfield cat. Suddenly, a pair of feet in slippers appeared in the frame, a girl in a white dress stood outside the glass window, squatting down to look at the kitten. [Yuan Shuai]'s phone gradually moved up until he could see the girl's face clearly.
0:9:21|0:9:40|The girl glanced at him and he absentmindedly recorded the girl's beauty on his phone. At that moment, the girl ran into the cafe, startling [Yuan Shuai] who was suddenly standing in front of her. The girl smiled at him while reaching her fingertips into the nearby fish tank, stirring the water clockwise.
0:9:48|0:9:58|Upon hearing the girl mention her own name, [Yuan Shuai] was surprised. He glanced down at his phone and saw that his blind date's last name was also Bai.
0:10:10|0:10:20|The girl picked up [Yuan Shuai]'s cup and drank it all in one go, then scooped up a cup of water from the fish tank, also caught a goldfish, drank it all in one breath, and then spit the goldfish back into the tank.
0:10:47|0:10:53|Hastily used a book to cover his face,
0:11:0|0:11:14|[Yuan Shuai] was not paying attention to what the girl was saying at all. A thug noticed him and tapped his companion. [Yuan Shuai] immediately got up and fled into the bathroom. He tried to escape through the window, but couldn't open it. In a panic, he pushed open the door of one of the stalls. Just then, the thugs rushed in with meteor hammers.
0:11:28|0:11:36|The thug leader Zhi Gang raised his hand in the compartment, and [Yuan Shuai] had to hand over his resume.
0:12:1|0:12:5|A woman is secretly filming her. At this moment, [Yuan Shuai] is taken away.
0:12:11|0:12:21|[Yuan Shuai] The real blind date partner has arrived today, but he is wearing a neck brace and can only awkwardly greet her. [Bai Xianchu] furrowed her brows in confusion.
0:12:48|0:13:3|A young man with silver hair, wearing a floral shirt, sat across from [Yuan Shuai], holding a knife that he plunged into a wooden board. With a swift motion, he actually chopped off his own pinky finger. He licked the severed finger and then ran the bloodied knife across [Yuan Shuai]'s face.
0:13:11|0:13:28|Zhi Gang took out Yuan Shuai's wallet, counted the money, and then threw the wallet on the ground, giving him a disdainful look. After they left, Yuan Shuai sat on the ground helplessly, lost in thought.
0:13:30|0:13:43|In the evening, [Yuan Shuai] returned to his run-down house. He sat on the sofa and took out his phone. Just as the screen lit up, a pair of hands gently patted his shoulder. Startled, he turned around and ended up sitting on the floor.
0:13:44|0:13:50|Upon closer inspection, it turns out that Bai Xianchu emerged from behind the sofa from the box.
0:14:10|0:14:18|Xiao Bai pouted while talking and looking at [Yuan Shuai], but [Yuan Shuai] frowned and cursed, then rubbed his head and sat back on the sofa.
0:15:6|0:15:13|He recalled saving a white fox in his childhood.
0:15:49|0:16:0|Xiao Bai jumped up and down in place, then viciously pounced on [Yuan Shuai] again, repeated the action, but there was still no change.
0:16:5|0:16:26|[Yuan Shuai] reached under the seat and pulled out a bottle of beer, handing it to Bai Xianchu. Bai Xianchu took the beer, gulped it down, leaving Yuan Shuai stunned as Bai Xianchu showed no change even after burping.
0:16:28|0:16:35|[Yuan Shuai] took out a bottle of liquor from the box again. After Bai Xianchu snatched the bottle, he threw the cap fiercely on the ground, ready to drink it all in one go.
0:16:36|0:16:47|In Yuan Shuai's surprise, Xiao Bai quickly finished the bottle of liquor and threw it on the ground.
0:17:3|0:17:8|[Yuan Shuai] tried to avoid looking, but couldn't help sneaking a peek. He was stunned into silence when he saw the changes in Xiaobai's body.
0:17:8|0:17:20|Bai Xianchu's eyes turned bloodshot, gradually growing white fur and a huge tail, bursting out of the clothes on his body, instantly transforming into a super-sized silver fox. [Yuan Shuai] was scared and sat paralyzed on the sofa, as the silver fox looked at him and licked its mouth.
0:17:20|0:17:36|He was so scared that he ran with all his might, but the Silver Fox reached out its paw trying to grab him. In the process, it accidentally stripped off his clothes, leaving only a pair of flowery underpants on his legs, with two scratch marks. He got up and ran out of the house, slamming the big iron gate shut.
0:17:36|0:17:47|So back to the opening scene of the film, the silver-haired man and the man with glasses who were monitoring [Yuan Shuai] outside were a little surprised to see [Yuan Shuai] rushing out shirtless. Just then, Little Bai, who had transformed into a silver fox, crashed through the iron gate.
0:17:47|0:17:58|Drunk and leaning against the iron gate, [Yuan Shuai] staggered. The silver-haired man dragged the man with glasses who was screaming in fear and ran backwards. [Yuan Shuai] ran barefoot on the road in the zoo, with little Bai stumbling behind him.
0:17:58|0:18:11|The golden snub-nosed monkey was perched on the wire mesh fence watching Yuan Shuai as if watching a show. Little Bai, because of his huge size, jumped onto the wooden roof and fell down, hitting his head. Yuan Shuai ran into the woods, but was stabbed in the foot by a tree branch, screaming in pain.
0:18:42|0:18:52|A man walks into a secret room and releases a bee-like small robot to the aunt before closing the door. The plaque in the magnificent secret room reads: "Third Division of the Monster Management Bureau, Humans and Monsters Have Different Paths, Alarm Bells Ringing Long."
0:18:52|0:19:0|He is the deputy director of the Monster Management Bureau, [Hong Sicong]. Several women descended from the sky and sat beside him, watching the big screen together.
0:19:5|0:19:14|On the screen, detailed information about Bai Xianchu is displayed. The scene then shifts to the street outside, where the injured Yuan Shuai grabs hold of an old lady pushing a tricycle.
0:19:31|0:19:46|Riding a tricycle selling watermelons, a man crashed into Xiao Bai head-on, causing the watermelons and the tricycle to fly in the air. The watermelons fell from the sky, one by one hitting at the feet of [Yuan Shuai], who was startled and jumped around. The tricycle happened to crash in front of him, but luckily he was unharmed. [Yuan Shuai] climbed over the railing and ran into a residential building.
0:19:48|0:20:3|He saw Little Bai stumbling and wagging his tail as he walked in the narrow alley from upstairs. He casually opened a door that was not closed and hid inside. Little Bai leaped onto the corridor, then used the corridor and the air conditioning unit on the building to jump onto the roof. With a forceful push from Little Bai, the air conditioning unit fell to the ground.
0:20:3|0:20:16|In the narrow street, on the damp ground, several women in short skirts and high heels run towards the direction where the air conditioner is falling. In the middle is [Hong Sicong] from the Monster Management Bureau, who takes off his coat and gives it a strong shake towards the sky.
0:20:24|0:20:34|Several henchmen leaped over the small car in front of them, and [Hong Sicong], using a few of them as support, leaped onto the balcony filled with flowers.
0:20:34|0:20:43|On the other side, [Yuan Shuai] came to the rooftop, stealthily moving from the inside to the outside of a huge billboard. He was wearing embroidered shoes, carefully sticking to the billboard, moving very slowly.
0:20:43|0:20:56|At this moment, Little Bai also followed him to the rooftop. The position where [Yuan Shuai] was standing was only two body lengths away from the edge, a little carelessness could lead to a fall. Suddenly, Little Bai launched an attack behind the billboard, revealing the face of international superstar Jia Bingbing on the poster.
0:20:56|0:21:12|Yuan Shuai was also caught in two big holes. He had to slowly move to the other side of the billboard. He squatted down at the edge of the billboard and looked back, but saw nothing. Standing up, he walked on the rooftop. At this moment, facing one side, Bai Xianchu, who was hiding in the gap of the billboard, suddenly stuck out his tongue and licked his face in a circle.
0:21:12|0:21:21|[Yuan Shuai] was frightened and ran out again. He pushed aside layers of drying sheets and reached the edge of the roof. Luckily, he grabbed the birdcage next to him and didn't fall down.
0:21:21|0:21:38|When he turned around again, Little Bai's face with the sheet on it had caught up to him. He held his head, slowly straightened his arched back, and carefully looked at the monster in front of him. Little Bai peeled off the sheet on his face, curled up his body, the huge tail slapped on the ground, and looked obediently at [Yuan Shuai] with big eyes.
0:21:38|0:21:49|[Yuan Shuai] also became bolder, reaching out his hand to approach Little White, attempting to pet it. Little White closed its eyes, sniffed [Yuan Shuai]'s hand, then suddenly opened its mouth wide, startling [Yuan Shuai].
0:21:49|0:21:55|He dodged backwards, accidentally stepping on a bottle. As he lost his balance, in a split second his body leaned back and grabbed onto a clothesline.
0:21:55|0:22:15|Who would have expected that the clothesline with a row of clothes, [Yuan Shuai], along with the birdcage, clothes hanger, and clothesline next to it, all fell down from the building. At this moment, [Hong Sicong] made a handsome appearance, using the clothesline rod between the buildings as a fulcrum, and leaped to rescue the falling objects. As [Yuan Shuai] came down, he was gently placed on the ground with a princess carry.
0:22:16|0:22:26|[Hong Sicong] pressed the switch on his waist player, stood with his teammates, and made cute expressions one after another, taking a group photo. As the teammates looked up, they saw Xiaobai quickly running away on the roof.
0:22:29|0:22:42|The male secretary took out a briefcase, and after the female team member opened it, she took out a glass tube and threw it into the air, immediately producing many small insect-like machines. The machines quickly locked onto the humans who had just witnessed the monster.
0:23:3|0:23:7|Bai Xianchu grabbed the flying insect heading towards Yuan Shuai with one hand.
0:23:20|0:23:28|Xiao Bai slapped [Hong Sicong] in the face, leaving his henchmen stunned beside him.
0:24:20|0:24:33|The subordinates applied ointment to the injured leg of [Yuan Shuai], and helped Xiao Bai onto the back of [Hong Sicong]. Just as [Hong Sicong] lifted Xiao Bai up, he was immediately vomited on, leaving him stunned and frozen in place, while his subordinates looked on in shock.
0:24:38|0:24:42|After speaking, [Hong Sicong] flicked his bangs, and his men threw [Yuan Shuai] to the ground before walking away confidently.
0:24:43|0:24:50|[Yuan Shuai], wearing only his underwear, lay on the ground, feeling a ray of sunlight shining on his face. He slowly opened his eyes.
0:25:9|0:25:22|[Yuan Shuai] got up and ran, grabbing a skirt that was hanging outside on the way. The aunt reading the newspaper on the roadside looked surprised. [Yuan Shuai] was wearing a dress, walking with messy hair in the alley, using his hand to cover his face as he walked. The old lady on the nearby stairs pointed and whispered when she saw him.
0:25:22|0:25:30|The streets of Shanghai are bustling with people coming and going, in a hurry, six hours later.
0:25:45|0:25:50|The man in the floral shirt with a small knife walked up to [Yuan Shuai], while the chubby man set down a wooden table.
0:25:53|0:25:59|Hearing this, the stick in the man with glasses' hand fell off in shock, and Zhi Gang awkwardly said,
0:26:16|0:26:23|[Yuan Shuai] sat on the floor, staring blankly at the ground.
0:26:27|0:26:42|The character in a floral shirt cuts off his own little finger with a small knife, stands up, holding the knife and the finger in one hand, and licks the wound with the other hand before walking up to [Yuan Shuai] and squatting down. [Yuan Shuai] takes the severed little finger from him, puts it in his own mouth, and starts licking it too.
0:26:43|0:26:55|Several hooligans were stunned as they looked at him. [Yuan Shuai] suddenly raised his head and looked at the floral shirt. The floral shirt, at a loss, looked towards Brother Zhigang, and reached out a hand to reveal a prosthetic limb prop.
0:27:9|0:27:17|[Yuan Shuai] threw his fingers on the ground and rushed to Brother Zhigang. At this moment, Xiaobai arrived and walked straight to [Yuan Shuai], asking fiercely,
0:27:42|0:27:48|Little Bai turned her head, and the fat guy was instantly thrown to the railing in the middle of the room, where he got stuck. [Yuan Shuai] was shocked and dropped his jaw on the spot.
0:28:14|0:28:26|[Yuan Shuai] stood in front of Bai Xianchu and roared, causing the thugs to retreat one after another. They all stared behind [Yuan Shuai], their eyes widened in fear, and then they ran away. [Yuan Shuai] thought he had scared off the thugs with his outburst, and a smile appeared on his face. But when he turned around,
0:28:27|0:28:46|White, a human with a fox head, [Yuan Shuai] quickly pushes open the large iron gate and flees outside. Inside the Monster Management Bureau, the big screen displays a Level Three alert: unauthorized transformation, with information about the Unity Zoo and [Bai Xianchu]. [Hong Sicong] is surrounded by subordinates on the sofa, watching the screen.
0:28:58|0:29:4|Male secretary asked [Hong Sicong], who handed the water glass to his subordinate next to him, stood up from the sofa and faced the male secretary.
0:29:11|0:29:26|The woman's subordinates raised the corners of their mouths behind him. On the other side, [Yuan Shuai] was running frantically in the alley, followed by a mosquito-like flying device. He lifted the sheet in front of him, suddenly had his mouth covered by a hand and pressed against the wall. Little Bai, who had turned into a human form, slapped the mosquito on the wall.
0:29:28|0:29:36|[Yuan Shuai] nodded at her, and Xiao Bai slowly removed the hand covering his mouth.
0:30:0|0:30:5|[Yuan Shuai] kept backing away, fell over a car frame, and flipped over. Xiao Bai pinned him down, locking his neck.
0:30:55|0:31:3|He shifted his gaze to Bai Xianchu's chest, took a quick glance, but Bai Xianchu smiled sweetly at him. He suddenly pulled out a wooden stick from somewhere and said to Bai Xianchu,
0:31:8|0:31:27|Bai Xianchu disappeared in a flash, [Yuan Shuai] took the opportunity to escape. Just as he turned around, Bai Xianchu appeared in front of him with a stick in his mouth. Bai Xianchu was swaying and showing off, looking at him and then handing over the stick in his mouth. [Yuan Shuai] was both surprised and embarrassed as he caught the stick, giving a thumbs-up to Bai Xianchu.
0:31:28|0:31:36|Xiao Bai smiled happily, [Yuan Shuai] threw the stick on the ground and picked up a stone.
0:31:40|0:31:51|After speaking, he used all his strength to throw the stone out, and Xiaobai immediately flew out. [Yuan Shuai] took the opportunity to turn and run. On the other side, several people in black suits suddenly broke into the Monster Management Bureau, and [Hong Sicong]'s men took a step back.
0:31:52|0:31:59|A man in a cloak stood in the center of the management bureau, with [Hong Sicong] sitting in a wheelchair, his feet wrapped in bandages, pushed out by a woman subordinate.
0:32:39|0:32:44|Hong Sicong's male subordinate was knocked down by Yun Zhonghe's subordinate with a punch on the spot.
0:32:45|0:33:1|[Yun Zhonghe] looked solemnly at the female subordinates beside him. Several beautiful female subordinates were scared and frowned, stepping back. He walked behind [Hong Sicong], stretched out his hands, and pressed hard on [Hong Sicong]'s shoulder. [Hong Sicong]'s face suddenly turned into a cat-like expression.
0:33:23|0:33:29|Director Yun pressed his index finger against [Hong Sicong]'s face.
0:33:52|0:34:6|And then a pair of huge vulture wings appeared, he used the wings to pull the woman's henchman into his arms, the henchman suddenly raised her head in pain, [Hong Sicong] got up from the wheelchair and was swept away by [Yun Zhonghe]'s wings.
0:34:7|0:34:18|[Yun Zhonghe] released the woman's hand, and put away the syringe with a needle in his hand. The woman's limbs twisted instantly, walking unsteadily and leaning against the wall, knocking over a vase and a table along the way.
0:34:18|0:34:28|The subordinates, seeing this scene, knelt on the ground, very afraid. Her hands were full of blood vessels, scratching many marks on the carpet with her nails. She grabbed her hair in pain, blood vessels gradually covering her whole body, and her eyes turned white.
0:34:30|0:34:43|In the moment she ran towards [Yun Zhonghe], one of [Yun Zhonghe]'s men pulled out a gun and shot the woman. She instantly turned into a little cat, while the other henchmen of [Hong Sicong] were already kneeling on the ground trembling. [Yun Zhonghe] squatted down and stroked the little cat, saying,
0:34:56|0:35:8|Yun Zhonghe and Hong Sicong locked eyes, and the henchmen who had just fired the gun took the kitten away. Yun Zhonghe stood up and said to Hong Sicong,
0:35:10|0:35:24|He placed the vial-like small bottle in his hand into the open briefcase held by his subordinate, and then left with his subordinate. Meanwhile, in a private kitchen, [Yuan Shuai] sat across from two women, one with long flowing hair and the other with stylish short hair. [Yuan Shuai] asked the woman with long hair,
0:36:47|0:36:59|Xiao Bai pursed her lips, [Yuan Shuai] pointed at her shoulder and pushed her aside, overturning the table next to them in front of a crowd. Glass cups, plates, along with [Yuan Shuai]'s documents scattered all over the floor, and the restaurant customers looked at him and whispered to each other.
0:36:59|0:37:12|[Yuan Shuai] looked at the mess on the ground, while Little Bai suddenly disappeared. [Yuan Shuai] put on a suit jacket and walked alone in the dim alley, the faint light in the alley making him look even more desolate.
0:37:14|0:37:20|[Yuan Shuai] stopped in his tracks as three figures in black approached him, with the one in the lead wearing a black cloak.
0:39:20|0:39:26|[Yun Zhonghe] took out something like a syringe and gestured on his neck.
0:39:28|0:39:39|[Yun Zhonghe] looked at the syringe in his hand and handed it to [Yuan Shuai]. [Yun Zhonghe] smiled, and one of his men behind [Yuan Shuai] took out something and placed it behind him. [Yuan Shuai] turned around and saw two stacks of banknotes.
0:40:9|0:40:22|[Yuan Shuai] came to the amusement park, walking towards the restaurant while asking around. He sat on a bench, and a girl carrying a huge plastic bag filled with plastic bottles approached. The girl ruthlessly crushed the empty bottles under his feet, and when [Yuan Shuai] looked up, he realized it was Bai Xianchu.
0:40:48|0:40:55|[Yuan Shuai] walked away with red eyes, while Bai Xianchu walked to a nearby bench with scrap in hand, stepping on the seat and sitting on the backrest.
0:41:1|0:41:13|The screen reads: "You have successfully paid 20,000 yuan, but still owe 80,000 yuan." He turned off his phone, and saw [Bai Xianchu] sitting next to him, absent-mindedly dragging his chin. He slowly approached [Bai Xianchu], with one hand reaching into his pocket.
0:41:13|0:41:28|He took out the syringe given to him by [Yun Zhonghe]. The bustling street and the two people lost in thought were out of sync. He slowly walked behind [Bai Xianchu], glanced into the distance, and then put the syringe back into his pocket.
0:41:30|0:41:38|He raised his finger, pointing towards a shining building in the distance, [Bai Xianchu] lifted his head and looked in the direction he was pointing.
0:41:50|0:41:59|[Yuan Shuai] turned his head and looked at [Bai Xianchu], sitting beside her.
0:42:26|0:42:33|[Bai Xianchu] squatted on the back of the chair, looking at [Yuan Shuai] and asked,
0:43:2|0:43:13|The fireworks above seemed to be blooming for the two of them. [Yuan Shuai] looked at [Bai Xianchu]'s clear and determined eyes following him, gradually stood up and revealed a content smile.
0:43:13|0:43:35|He turned around slowly, looking at the dazzling fireworks in the sky. He smiled from the bottom of his heart, but when he turned back, he found that [Bai Xianchu], who had been sitting on the bench, was gone. [Yuan Shuai] nervously looked around, the amusement park was crowded with people.
0:43:35|0:43:41|The scene shifts to a brightly lit nightclub, where [Bai Xianchu] arrives.
0:44:1|0:44:10|Two girls in short skirts uniforms walked in, with [Bai Xianchu] following behind. A man in sunglasses and a woman in glasses were sitting on the sofa in the middle.
0:44:21|0:44:31|[Bai Xianchu] rushed to Chang's side the moment she saw the banknotes. Meanwhile, [Yuan Shuai] also arrived at the nightclub. In the corridor, he spotted a piece of clothing and picked it up to examine it closely.
0:44:45|0:44:55|In the private room, the woman with glasses walked to the side, glancing at [Bai Xianchu] who was singing, with a strange light in her eyes, she pushed her glasses with her hand. Outside the room, [Yuan Shuai] was anxiously pushing open the door of a private room, where men and women inside were happily holding wine bottles.
0:45:13|0:45:23|Outside the nightclub, an off-road vehicle stopped. The assistant opened the door for [Yun Zhonghe], who got out of the car and led his men into the nightclub. The female manager hurried over and said,
0:45:31|0:45:36|The female manager lifted the suit of her subordinate, revealing the gun at her waist. She waved her hand repeatedly, while [Yun Zhonghe] stared at her sternly.
0:45:55|0:46:11|[Yuan Shuai] suddenly burst into the private room, everyone looked at him, and [Bai Xianchu] stood still upon seeing him. In the corridor of the nightclub, men and women were lying on the ground as if dead. Trays and bottles were scattered all over the floor, and some glowing mosquitoes were flying around. [Yun Zhonghe] led his men into a private room.
0:46:36|0:46:47|[Yuan Shuai] took off his suit jacket while talking, and put it on [Bai Xianchu], revealing the shirt with one sleeve missing. He turned his back and took out the syringe that [Yun Zhonghe] gave him from his pants pocket, holding it above his head to show Xiao Bai.
0:47:4|0:47:11|[Yuan Shuai] approached Xiao Bai while talking, Xiao Bai kept backing away, [Yuan Shuai] gestured with his hands to show how to attack her, but Xiao Bai suddenly moved forward.
0:47:27|0:47:40|Xiao Bai pointed at her own neck, looking into [Yuan Shuai]'s eyes and pressing him for an answer, but [Yuan Shuai] dared not meet her gaze.
0:47:43|0:47:59|After speaking, he turned around and took a few steps forward. Bai Xianchu stood still and watched his back. He slowed down his pace and sneakily glanced at Bai Xianchu from the corner of his eye. Bai Xianchu also approached him slowly, resting her chin on his shoulder from behind and holding his hand that was in his pocket with a syringe.
0:48:12|0:48:33|[Yuan Shuai] turned his head to look at Xiaobai's face, then lowered his head. Xiaobai stared fixedly at [Yuan Shuai]'s profile, then slowly lifted her head.
0:48:36|0:48:40|Yuan Shuai exposed his snow-white neck to her and closed his eyes. He looked at Xiaobai's neck and then at her face.
0:48:40|0:48:56|Suddenly, a hand grabbed her neck and kissed her forcefully, causing Xiaobai to open her eyes in shock. [Yuan Shuai] held her tightly against his back, and Xiaobai was initially at a loss. When [Yuan Shuai] gently released her, she slowly took the initiative to kiss back and wrapped her arms around [Yuan Shuai]'s neck.
0:48:56|0:49:9|The two of them, bathed in the moonlight, temporarily forgot about the differences between humans and demons, weaving the appearance of love. The scene shifts to [Yuan Shuai] outside the dilapidated house he lives in at the zoo.
0:49:12|0:49:19|[Bai Xianchu] suddenly appeared in front of [Yuan Shuai] with a kitchen knife, cut his own palm with the knife, and then forcibly cut [Yuan Shuai]'s palm before interlocking their fingers.
0:50:12|0:50:20|[Bai Xianchu] smiled and pushed [Yuan Shuai]'s chest with both hands, causing him to instantly fly backwards and fall onto the bed. Feathers floated in the air, and [Bai Xianchu] leaped into the air.
0:51:19|0:51:30|On the other side, [Yun Zhonghe]'s subordinate reported to him the message they received, which read: "The demon has exceeded the contact limit, a group of glowing mosquitoes flew towards the woman with glasses."
0:51:50|0:51:58|[Yun Zhonghe] tore off the glasses of the woman, who was actually wearing a human skin mask of an orchid. She instantly fell onto the sofa, revealing a pair of huge butterfly wings on her back.
0:52:27|0:52:39|On the other side, [Bai Xianchu] lay beside [Yuan Shuai] without falling asleep. When she heard the sound of the phone, she got up from the bed, took out [Yuan Shuai]'s phone from the pants on the floor, and saw a video call from her schizophrenic father on the screen.
0:53:14|0:53:29|She stabbed behind her at [Yun Zhonghe], but he was prepared and grabbed her wrist with one hand and pressed her head with the other. [Yun Zhonghe] pulled her hair back and raised it, holding her hand to his neck, and blue blood gushed out instantly. The blue orchid quickly fell on the sofa.
0:53:29|0:53:41|[Yun Zhonghe] placed the dagger in Chang's hand, took out a handkerchief, wiped his own hands, and finally covered the face of the butterfly orchid with the handkerchief. On the other side, [Yuan Shuai] was awakened and sat up from the bed, while [Bai Xianchu] also changed into an old-fashioned outfit.
0:53:41|0:53:52|Men in uniform. A group of black-clad individuals with weapons arrive at the dilapidated house where [Bai Xianchu] and [Yuan Shuai] reside, and the two open the door.
0:54:35|0:54:41|[Yun Zhonghe]'s black eyeballs suddenly turned orange-red, [Bai Xianchu] revealed sharp claws, and the black-clothed men around raised their guns.
0:54:41|0:54:51|All the people present were attracted by the singing, looking up and searching around for the source of the sound. A figure in black leaped to the top of the pavilion and landed on all fours, [Yun Zhonghe].
0:54:51|0:54:59|Behind him, he raised his head and it was [Hong Sicong] from the Demon Control Bureau. With a player hanging from his waist, he approached [Yun Zhonghe] and turned off the button as he walked.
0:56:14|0:56:20|[Bai Xianchu] took the opportunity to pull [Yuan Shuai] away, while [Hong Sicong] swiftly knocked the weapons out of the hands of Yun Zhonghe's men, preparing to chase after the two of them.
0:56:20|0:56:30|On the side, [Hong Sicong]'s men were all held back by [Yun Zhonghe]'s men. [Yun Zhonghe] aimed at [Hong Sicong] and fired, turning [Hong Sicong] into a small cat. [Bai Xianchu] pressed down on [Yuan Shuai]'s head, and a bullet passed through their heads.
0:56:30|0:56:41|The black-clothed person with an axe took the opportunity to attack them. [Bai Xianchu] pushed [Yuan Shuai] away and quickly dealt with a few rookie henchmen. Just as she held a weapon against the neck of a black-clothed person, [Yun Zhonghe] called out to her.
0:56:42|0:56:50|[Yun Zhonghe] holds a dagger against [Yuan Shuai]'s neck. [Bai Xianchu] puts down her weapon and walks towards [Yun Zhonghe], but the dagger in [Yun Zhonghe]'s hand gets even closer.
0:56:51|0:57:2|[Bai Xianchu] knelt on the ground, hands raised. A henchman approached from behind, pressing her head down and locking an electronic collar around her neck. [Yun Zhonghe] stared at her palms, furrowing his brow. If [Bai Xianchu] exerted any force, the collar would deliver an electric shock, causing her pain.
0:57:2|0:57:14|Reluctant to live. [Yun Zhonghe] was getting close to examine the blade in [Bai Xianchu]'s palm when Zhi Gang and his three henchmen suddenly arrived. Everyone present turned their gaze towards Zhi Gang, and the man with glasses pushed aside the black-clothed person holding a weapon.
0:57:18|0:57:28|[Yun Zhonghe] looked at the four people in front of him in confusion, as the man with glasses snatched the gun from the person in black.
0:57:40|0:57:52|[Yun Zhonghe] slapped the face in the floral shirt, [Bai Xianchu] took the opportunity to break free from the collar and ran out, but the man with glasses accidentally triggered the gun in his hand, hitting [Bai Xianchu]. In an instant, [Bai Xianchu] was knocked back to his original form, turning into a giant silver fox.
0:57:54|0:58:6|Several thugs were so scared that their eyes widened and mouths hung open. [Bai Xianchu] picked up [Yuan Shuai] and placed him on his back. The black-clothed person picked up a weapon and surrounded the huge monster in front of them, but no one dared to make a move, and no one was willing to step forward to attack.
0:58:6|0:58:15|Bai Xianchu and Yuan Shuai shot again with their guns, only to be evaded by the huge silver fox. They charged forward, crossing over many men in black and thugs.
0:58:15|0:58:29|They were frantically escaping on the rooftop, with the black-clothed men chasing closely behind. They were jumping around on the rooftop at high speed, occasionally shooting at them, shattering the building and scattering debris everywhere. [Yuan Shuai] could only stick close to [Bai Xianchu]'s back to avoid being hit.
0:58:30|0:58:41|[Bai Xianchu] leaped between buildings, narrowly missing a huge gap between two buildings. With red eyes, [Bai Xianchu] pressed on through the hail of bullets, while [Yuan Shuai] glanced back to check the position of the black-clothed figure.
0:58:42|0:58:54|The bullet passed by, [Bai Xianchu] agilely dodged obstacles and bullets, reaching the rooftop of a building by the street. He sprinted upwards and successfully landed on a higher rooftop. The men in black were blocked by the wide road, only able to raise their guns and shoot at the building across the street.
0:58:54|0:59:6|On the wall of the room, [Hong Sicong] watched helplessly as Bai Xianchu and [Yuan Shuai] escaped. They arrived at the rooftop of a high-rise building with a helipad, where [Yuan Shuai] gently stroked the fur of the massive creature beneath him, unaware of the impending danger.
0:59:6|0:59:14|In the distance, [Yun Zhonghe] stood on the rooftop, aiming the electronic mother ship at Xiaobai's body through the scope. A dart filled with a drug was shot out.
0:59:14|0:59:24|At a rapid speed, Yuan Shuai flew towards Bai Xianchu. Bai Xianchu sensed something unusual and cautiously ducked down. The mother ship seemed to be tracked, flying two circles in the sky before...
0:59:24|0:59:40|Flying towards Xiaobai at an extremely fast speed. Xiaobai, with [Yuan Shuai], rushed in panic and leaped into the air, luckily the arrow shot onto the rooftop. [Yun Zhonghe] widened his different-colored pupils, grew huge vulture wings from his back, and soared into the sky.
0:59:41|0:59:46|The scene shifts to the Hengdian Ancient Costume Film and Television Shooting Base, where a large sign reads: "No entry for unauthorized personnel."
0:59:47|0:59:57|Yuan Shuai is carried by Bai Xianchu, appearing on the roof of a pavilion building, then jumping from a side hall to the roof of the main hall, looking around. Yuan Shuai lightly pats Bai Xianchu and asks,
0:59:58|1:0:14|The lively Bai Xianchu suddenly lowered his head, squinted his eyes, and licked his front hoof. At this moment, a blue light suddenly appeared in the sky, and the flying poisonous arrow instantly pierced Bai's back. Bai jumped in pain, causing Yuan Shuai to be thrown backwards.
1:0:14|1:0:23|Injured Bai Xianchu fled in all directions, and the two of them fell into the woods beside the palace. [Yun Zhonghe] flew over the palace to take a look.
1:0:30|1:0:37|[Yuan Shuai] took off his coat to cover her, took out his phone from his pocket and handed it to the weak Bai Xianchu.
1:0:54|1:1:7|A camper van stopped in front of the two, and [Jia Bingbing] in imperial costume ran down from the van.
1:1:31|1:1:50|[Jia Bingbing] applied ointment to the wound, and the originally huge wound miraculously began to heal slowly. Meanwhile, [Yun Zhonghe]'s men were using flashlights to search for clues in the woods. [Yun Zhonghe] looked around and stopped in front of a flower, squatting down to touch the leaves and finding some fresh blood.
1:1:50|1:2:6|He carefully examined the blood on his hands, and his pupils emitted a strange light once again. The scene shifted to the Renai Mental Health Center, where a nurse was lying on the ground, surrounded by some glowing mosquitoes flying around. At that moment, several men in black approached, with Yuan Shuai's father standing with his back to the door.
1:2:6|1:2:18|Lying on the bed on his side, his eyes were rolling around, and several men in black walked straight to his sickbed. The scene then shifted to the inside of [Jia Bingbing]'s trailer.
1:2:35|1:2:43|[Jia Bingbing] lowered her head to think of a solution, while Bai Xianchu pushed back her hair. [Jia Bingbing] took out a hair tie with a bull demon king design and threw it to Yuan Shuai. Yuan Shuai stared at her blankly.
1:2:44|1:2:48|The RV drove to the set, and the scene shifted to an indoor shooting location.
1:3:10|1:3:20|On set, there are many extras dressed in ancient costumes and as monsters. [Yuan Shuai] leads Little Bai to observe the surroundings, while [Yun Zhonghe] arrives at the set entrance with a strong presence.
1:4:3|1:4:15|Jia Bingbing had just stretched out her arm when she was interrupted by the director. She looked at the director, who got up from his seat with a megaphone in hand, looking helpless.
1:4:16|1:4:26|All eyes followed the director's footsteps as he walked through a group of extras and approached a man in a golden robe with half a bun hairstyle, pulling his collar to the center of the set.
1:5:4|1:5:10|The director's voice caught the attention of [Yun Zhonghe], who stared at [Yuan Shuai] and [Bai Xianchu].
1:5:22|1:5:37|Jia Bingbing lowered her head to think of a solution. When she came to her senses, she waved her arm and Xiao Bai pulled [Yuan Shuai] to run wildly in the crowd.
1:6:40|1:6:47|[Yun Zhonghe] stared straight at Xiaobai in the crowd.
1:7:7|1:7:12|She glanced at Bai Xianchu, who furrowed his brow and reluctantly stepped down from the sedan chair.
1:7:30|1:7:44|The extras turned their heads and walked towards [Yun Zhonghe], facing him with dozens of henchmen with blue paint on their faces. Xiao Bai extended his claws and entered battle mode.
1:7:46|1:8:1|At a command, the two forces of humans and demons clashed together. Leading the charge, the extras wearing masks suddenly stopped in their tracks and seized [Yun Zhonghe] around the waist in the chaos. Xiao Bai engaged in a battle with [Yuan Shuai] and the person with a shield, but [Yuan Shuai] was accidentally pushed to the ground.
1:8:1|1:8:16|Xiao Bai, with anger in her eyes, bared her fangs and lunged at the person who pushed [Yuan Shuai] to the ground. Startled, [Yuan Shuai] quickly got up, grabbed some sand from the ground, and threw it at the person. Xiao Bai swiftly dealt with the obstacles around them, pulled up [Yuan Shuai], and ran away.
1:8:16|1:8:28|[Yun Zhonghe] saw the two trying to escape, spread his wings from his clothes, took off into the sky, trying to catch up. But in mid-air, he was grabbed by a leg and fell into the sand. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be Brother Zhigang.
1:8:38|1:8:44|Yun Zhonghe's wings flapped, and Zhi Gang and his men were knocked down. On the other side, Bai Xianchu casually picked up a shield and threw it, hitting the black-clothed men chasing them.
1:8:46|1:8:52|Bai Xianchu pushes Yuan Shuai away, while Yuan Shuai struggles to run towards the door in the flying sand and dust.
1:9:6|1:9:16|Yun Zhonghe's two henchmen dragged Yuan Shuai's father's feet, causing Yuan Shuai to fall to his knees on the ground. Yun Zhonghe removed the old man's mask and stepped on his head.
1:9:28|1:9:44|[Yuan Shuai] shifted his gaze to the poison on the sand beside him. Meanwhile, Little Bai, who was busy killing people while holding the neck of [Yun Zhonghe], noticed [Yuan Shuai] behind her. She dropped the body she was holding and walked towards [Yuan Shuai], revealing her terrifying fangs as she glared fiercely at [Yun Zhonghe].
1:9:45|1:9:49|Yun Zhonghe's two henchmen behind him were about to make a move, but they were stopped by Yun Zhonghe.
1:9:50|1:10:3|Xiao Bai looked at the elderly man with white hair writhing in pain on the ground, then glanced at the filial son [Yuan Shuai] kneeling beside him. Xiao Bai squatted down in front of him, gently lifted [Yuan Shuai]'s hand holding the poison.
1:10:12|1:10:28|Yuan Shuai stared in horror as the poison was injected into Bai Xianchu's neck during the struggle, unable to believe what he was seeing. Bai Xianchu weakly looked into his eyes and whispered a sentence, a tear sliding down from the corner of his eye.
1:10:31|1:10:46|Suddenly her body twisted, [Yuan Shuai] released the poison needle and backed away in fear. [Yun Zhonghe] lifted his head triumphantly and looked at the two. Little Bai kept rolling on the ground, one eye turning white.
1:10:46|1:11:1|[Yuan Shuai] knelt on the ground, holding his head in fear and regret. [Yuan's Father] lay on the side, clutching the sand on the ground in agony. Bai Xianchu gradually calmed down, but his neck was covered with deep red veins that extended all the way to his beautiful face.
1:11:1|1:11:8|After who knows how long, only [Yuan Shuai] was left kneeling beside her, the extras dispersed and left from their side.
1:11:10|1:11:19|Three months later, [Yuan Shuai] lay alone on the bed, half-opening his eyes. He sat up blankly, then blankly brushed his teeth in front of the mirror.
1:11:45|1:11:53|Without waiting for the person on the phone to finish speaking, he hung up and went to the hospital.
1:12:41|1:12:54|When he was about to leave, he suddenly heard a familiar voice. He turned around to find the source of the voice, which was coming from his dad's phone.
1:13:45|1:14:1|He took his dad's phone, watched the video call, and returned to the dilapidated house covered in vines in the zoo where they used to live. The grass outside the door had turned golden, and inside the house, the bird models and plants were entangled in spider webs.
1:14:1|1:14:15|He looked at the familiar surroundings in the room, the mottled walls and various simulated animal models, and slowly walked towards the simulated fox placed in the corner of the wall. He took off the white clothes draped over it.
1:14:15|1:14:31|He opened the clothes, looked carefully, then sat on the edge of the bed, gently stroking the clothes in his hand, lying sideways on the messy bed, and tightly hugging the clothes to his chest.
1:14:34|1:14:39|At this moment, the blanket behind him was suddenly lifted, revealing the head of a man.
1:14:40|1:14:46|With disheveled hair and smeared makeup, [Hong Sicong] sits up in bed and grits his teeth, saying,
1:15:16|1:15:38|The two fought from the bed to the ground, [Yuan Shuai] pulled a piece of cloth over his head and then picked up a wooden rack to hit him on the head. He stared blankly at [Hong Sicong], who sat in place crying, while the disheveled [Yuan Shuai] also sat aside. [Hong Sicong] took a leaf and stuffed it into his mouth.
1:15:50|1:15:59|[Hong Sicong] took out his phone from his pocket, turned on the screen, and threw it to [Yuan Shuai]. [Yuan Shuai] opened the news app for the demon world.
1:17:0|1:17:14|[Yuan Shuai] sat on the ground dejectedly, [Hong Sicong] slowly turned to look at [Yuan Shuai], and handed him the ointment made of leaves.
1:17:16|1:17:21|[Yuan Shuai] looked at the ointment, then looked at [Hong Sicong].
1:17:39|1:17:50|Two people arrived at a small shop called A Bao Noodle House. A fat man in a vest and hat stood up and walked to [Yuan Shuai]. The boss led the two to the kitchen and closed the door.
1:17:50|1:17:57|At the food counter. He kneads the dough on the cutting board, then picks up a small porcelain bottle and pours the liquid from the bottle onto the dough.
1:18:14|1:18:20|The boss pasted the dough on [Yuan Shuai]'s face, pinched his face for a long time with his hands, shaping it into a pancake, leaving two breathing holes for his nostrils.
1:18:20|1:18:32|The dough on [Yuan Shuai]'s face began to glow and heat up, and he saw the boss's face distorted through the cracks in the dough. The boss then took out a wig and put it on his head. When he lifted the dough,
1:18:32|1:18:44|[Yuan Shuai]'s face has turned into that of [Yun Zhonghe]. The boss picked up a stainless steel basin and had [Yuan Shuai] take a look. The disguised [Yuan Shuai] as [Yun Zhonghe] and [Hong Sicong] walked into a dilapidated compartment, where there was a huge freezer in front of them.
1:18:46|1:18:52|The boss threw each of them a flashy cotton-padded jacket, and the two of them walked into the freezer holding the clothes.
1:19:0|1:19:9|As the freezer door closed, the two, along with the freezer, fell from the air and landed in a corridor. The freezer automatically tipped over, causing the two to fall inside in a disoriented manner.
1:19:10|1:19:22|The freezer grew four wheels, the engine spun rapidly, turning into a super fast launcher, accelerating forward in the tunnel. When it reached a sharp turn, the freezer crashed around in the tunnel.
1:19:23|1:19:32|The two were twisted in the refrigerator, even biting into an apple. The refrigerator arrived at Nanjing West Road.
1:19:40|1:19:45|They looked around, took off their heavy cotton coats, and walked towards a large iron gate.
1:19:46|1:19:53|[Yuan Shuai] pushed open a crack in the door, and both of them leaned in to observe secretly. He suddenly turned and ran, causing [Hong Sicong] to slip and fall to the ground in fright.
1:20:17|1:20:26|The two of them arrived at the top floor, slowly entered the hall, observing the surroundings. A large poster of seven Calabash Brothers hung in the corridor.
1:20:45|1:20:50|The monsters playing poker took out weapons and shields, lined up, and [Yuan Shuai] took a step back.
1:21:37|1:21:45|[Yuan Shuai] turned his head and glanced at [Hong Sicong]. With a single look from [Hong Sicong], he slapped the leader in the face, startling both the female staff at the front desk and [Hong Sicong].
1:21:47|1:22:2|[Yuan Shuai] blinked blankly, turned to look at [Hong Sicong]. [Hong Sicong] glanced around, then looked at the person in charge's face, and asked,
1:22:37|1:23:0|The girl at the front desk extended a long and thick snake tail to retrieve a card from above, and the manager swiped the card and led the two into the elevator. As the elevator doors opened, the manager led the way ahead, while the two observed the interior of the prison. There were many bridges connecting the huge space here, with some eyeball-like things floating in the air.
1:23:18|1:23:23|After facial recognition, there was another door inside, and after opening it, it was all dark inside.
1:23:36|1:23:44|[Yuan Shuai] walked in alone, the door behind him closed, with a faint light inside. [Yuan Shuai] walked forward slowly.
1:23:58|1:24:8|He followed the huge iron chain at his feet and found a silver-haired woman holding her head, sitting on the ground with her back to him.
1:24:10|1:24:26|He crouched down, and the woman turned her head to reveal white pupils. As he approached her, she hugged her knees and moved back. When a beam of light shone on her face, [Yuan Shuai] saw that Xiaobai's face was now covered with blood vessels, her eyeballs had no pupils, and sharp fangs were exposed.
1:24:26|1:24:45|He suddenly pounced towards [Yuan Shuai], knocking him down to the ground. The noise was heard by [Hong Sicong] and the supervisor outside the door. The supervisor nodded with a smile. Meanwhile, there was another commotion in the cell. The supervisor went to check it out, and [Hong Sicong] pulled out the electric baton from his waist and threw it on the ground.
1:25:5|1:25:22|The leader looked at him with a smile on his face, nodding and bowing. On the other side, [Yuan Shuai] approached Xiao Bai, who looked at him with unfamiliarity. [Yuan Shuai] then tore off his own human skin mask.
1:25:35|1:25:42|[Yuan Shuai] reached out his hand to touch Xiaobai's face, but Xiaobai bit his wrist.
1:25:47|1:26:0|With a swift swipe of Bai Xianchu's claws, Yuan Shuai was sent flying. His head slammed hard against the wall, and as he reached up to touch it, his fingers came away bloody, with several scratch marks on his face.
1:26:58|1:27:2|Xiao Bai kicked [Yuan Shuai] down and roared at him while holding the chain.
1:27:3|1:27:11|[Yuan Shuai] knelt on the ground, clutching his abdomen in pain, raised his left hand and showed the palm to Bai Xianchu.
1:27:13|1:27:20|Bai Xianchu leaned in to look at the scar in Yuan Shuai's palm.
1:27:32|1:27:42|[Yuan Shuai] grabbed Bai's hand and pressed it against his own face, frantically slapping it. Bai, in agony, put his fingers into his mouth.
1:27:44|1:27:55|[Yuan Shuai] ignored Little Bai's terrifying appearance, hugged her and pulled her into his arms, then kissed her fiercely. The door of the cell suddenly opened, and [Hong Sicong] walked in.
1:28:8|1:28:20|[Hong Sicong] threw the mask on the ground to [Yuan Shuai], who then put on the human skin mask of [Yun Zhonghe]. [Hong Sicong] led Little Bai, who was bound and wearing a mask, out of the elevator under the guidance of the leader.
1:28:21|1:28:26|Walking into the hall, the group coincidentally ran into the real [Yun Zhonghe], dressed in a cloak, accompanied by a female journalist and dozens of henchmen wearing eagle beak masks.
1:28:28|1:28:44|The real and fake [Yun Zhonghe] meet face to face, [Yuan Shuai] raises his head, the leader and the journalist are dumbfounded, the real [Yun Zhonghe] carefully examines the person in front of him who looks exactly like himself. Little [Bai Xianchu] suddenly becomes agitated, [Hong Sicong] comforts her by patting her shoulder.
1:28:44|1:28:51|The leader pulled out a weapon, and the Eagle Beak team also took out their weapons. Infrared light was aimed at [Yuan Shuai], who pointed at [Yun Zhonghe] and said,
1:29:14|1:29:21|The leader approached [Yuan Shuai], only to be slapped in the face.
1:29:42|1:29:47|[Yun Zhonghe] untied the cloak around his neck, revealing his huge wings.
1:30:6|1:30:15|[Yun Zhonghe] stared at [Yuan Shuai], folded his wings. A female journalist on the side was live streaming the scene with her phone, [Yuan Shuai] glared at the person in charge, walked towards him, forcing the person in charge to step back.
1:30:40|1:30:46|The female journalist on the side was live streaming the scene with her phone, as the clasp on [Bai Xianchu]'s back gradually came undone.
1:30:53|1:31:3|Struggling free, [Bai Xianchu] slapped [Yuan Shuai] in the face, causing his human skin mask to fall to the ground. With a smirk on his face, [Yun Zhonghe] watched as two monster security guards dragged away [Bai Xianchu].
1:31:7|1:31:11|The monsters were discussing animatedly, while [Yuan Shuai] stood in place, awkwardly looking around.
1:31:23|1:31:34|Hong Sicong's face grew fur, his eyes turned into shadows of a cat, revealing fangs and sharp claws. Just as he approached Yun Zhonghe to scratch him, Yun Zhonghe grabbed his neck, punched him and sent him flying into the wall, smashing the tiles into pieces.
1:32:18|1:32:29|Saying that, [Yun Zhonghe] pulled out a sharp knife and pressed it against [Yuan Shuai]'s neck. At this moment, a large hole was suddenly chiseled out of the ground, and everyone stared at the floor. A dirty man unexpectedly crawled out from inside, throwing out a metal plate covered in dirt.
1:32:29|1:32:45|At this moment, [Yun Zhonghe] took the knife away from [Yuan Shuai]'s neck and looked at the person climbing out of the pit, who turned out to be the small-time hoodlum with glasses. Behind him, two other hoodlums and the gang leader Zhigang climbed out as well, all four of them wearing tattered prison uniforms huddled together.
1:32:45|1:32:52|Their faces and bodies were covered in dirt, and everyone was watching them like they were monkeys. The Demon Realm News Eye also broadcasted this incident live.
1:34:12|1:34:18|The man in glasses seized the opportunity to climb to the switch in the prison, and the person in charge shouted anxiously,
1:34:42|1:34:55|The prison doors all opened, and the monsters inside walked out like zombies. Hong Sicong's henchmen and the noodle shop owner were watching the live broadcast, Yun Zhonghe gritted his teeth in anger, and the journalist was stunned holding a phone.
1:34:55|1:35:10|In the building of Lianjia Real Estate, several bird beasts flew out through the glass, and many monsters escaped from the prison to the hall, leaving the monster security guards completely helpless. [Yuan Shuai] knelt on the ground, looking at all this in astonishment.
1:35:11|1:35:27|Yun Zhonghe's subordinates surrounded him. A monster that escaped accidentally stepped on the player dropped by Hong Sicong on the ground, attracting a swarm of monsters. Yuan Shuai took the opportunity to attack the security guards around him, protecting Xiao Bai underneath him. The journalist opened his mouth in fear, and many monsters were shot.
1:35:28|1:35:43|Blue and green blood gushed from the thigh, the person in charge climbing up the curtain was kicked hard by the monster, a journalist being carried on the shoulder by a monster, while [Yuan Shuai] and Bai Xianchu hid in the corner.
1:35:46|1:35:53|Xiao Bai covered her face and looked carefully at [Yuan Shuai]. When [Yuan Shuai] tried to reach out to touch her face, Xiao Bai dodged backwards.
1:35:56|1:36:10|At this moment, [Yun Zhonghe] spread his wings, flew in the center of the hall, holding a crossbow, and ruthlessly shot down the monsters. This scene was secretly filmed by the journalists hiding in the underground passage.
1:36:22|1:36:24|The monsters watching the live broadcast were all very terrified.
1:36:25|1:36:34|[Hong Sicong] got up from the ground and followed him on all fours, gesturing towards [Yuan Shuai] on the other side with a gesture of "you guys go first, I'll take care of him". [Yuan Shuai] understood the meaning as "Got it, you want me to go up".
