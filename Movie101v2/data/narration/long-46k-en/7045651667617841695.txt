0:3:58|0:4:9|The mysterious figure stepped out, throwing back the cloak to reveal his true identity, startling [Master Long]. Beads of sweat as big as beans rolled down [Master Long]'s face.
0:4:21|0:4:31|Aunt Zhang quickly made a dish that made everyone present scrunch their eyebrows at the taste.
0:5:11|0:5:36|Aunt Zhang scooped up a spoonful of soup and put it in her mouth. After struggling to swallow it, her pupils instantly dilated. The taste of the soup spread in her mouth, passed through her throat into her stomach, causing unbearable pain, and she collapsed convulsing on the ground.
0:5:56|0:6:2|Suddenly, a voice behind him caught his attention. When he turned around, he saw a person holding his dark cuisine and continuously feeding himself with chopsticks.
0:6:37|0:6:48|The appearance of the culinary god [Lu Xiaoyu] caused a stir among the group, with everyone rushing up to ask for autographs. Amidst the crowd, [Lu Xiaoyu] left, and the secretary approached [Boss Cai], whispering something in his ear.
0:8:50|0:9:0|[Lu Xiaoyu] said it was tough, but then picked up the tissue next to him. After one night, [Xiao Tian] woke up immediately when he saw the floor full of tissues.
0:9:43|0:10:5|[Xiao Tian] accidentally pushed open a door in the mall, outside of which was a steep slope. The two of them stepped on air and rolled down the slope, then crashed open another door. Outside the door was a whole new world, with the first thing that caught their eyes being a child eating noodles.
0:10:10|0:10:19|[Lu Xiaoyu] shifted her gaze from the child who couldn't get noodles to the street called Fallen Street pointed out by [Xiao Tian].
0:10:31|0:10:47|The street is surrounded by tall buildings, with low-rise buildings contrasting sharply with them. The flow of people on the street is constant. In front of a small restaurant, the graceful [Sister Mei] is singing, placing her exquisitely cooked lobster on the customers' tables.
0:10:47|0:11:2|Grilled meat expert [Li Jianguo] was practicing weightlifting with a can of beef, while tech geek [Yong Jun] was shouting at a few kids on the noisy street, explaining chemical equations to them. [Lu Xiaoyu]'s face was pressed against [Xiao Tian]'s arm, carefully observing the people on the street.
0:11:2|0:11:20|[Xiao Tian] turned his head and looked down, sensing that something was wrong. He stood up and walked towards the street, arriving at the front of a shop claiming to be the only designated authentic snack shop on Fallen Street. In addition to selling snacks and hot pot, this shop also offers traditional massage services.
0:11:20|0:11:29|The two looked at the exaggerated sign, then skeptically at the location shown on the phone map, their faces filled with disbelief, but still walked into the shop.
0:12:4|0:12:18|Boss [Jerry] immediately became excited when he heard this. He closed the door of the restaurant while stepping on his squeaky light-up shoes, then opened his coat.
0:12:54|0:13:3|The two continued to walk outside, with [Jerry] cursing under his breath.
0:13:34|0:13:37|[Xiao Tian] left Fallen Street, [Lu Xiaoyu] entered the house alone.
0:15:1|0:15:14|Turning to leave, [Lu Xiaoyu] was once again stopped by [Jerry]. He approached the smirking [Jerry] and couldn't help but snort coldly.
0:15:25|0:15:41|[Jerry] hoisted a heavy weapon, [Lu Xiaoyu] ran around trying to escape. [Jerry] shot towards him, but instead of bullets, water sprayed out of the gun. [Lu Xiaoyu] dodged the water column, but let out a few screams of pain, his face filled with fear when he saw what happened.
0:15:41|0:15:54|Time seemed to slow down, as Aunt Zhang, who was trimming a customer's hair in the barbershop, involuntarily started to shake. It turned out that the water column sprayed onto Boss Cai's face. Everyone present held their breath, unsure of what to do.
0:15:54|0:16:10|[Lu Xiaoyu] left the shop at rocket speed, while [Jerry] closed the door of the snack bar. [Lu Xiaoyu] hid in the alley, covering her pounding heart, breathing heavily. Meanwhile, [Boss Cai's Secretary] used a hairdryer to dry [Boss Cai]'s hair and sprayed styling gel on it.
0:16:22|0:16:30|In the moment of turning around, the popcorn machine suddenly made a bang, [Boss Cai] was completely furious and shouted hysterically.
0:16:32|0:16:54|Chaos erupted on the fallen street, people at the snack stalls scattered in all directions, screams filled the air, [Boss Cai]'s henchmen smashed tables and chairs, causing panic among the crowd. Adults and children bent over to protect their heads and rushed indoors, no one dared to stop the melee. [Boss Cai] looked on with satisfaction at everything in front of him.
0:16:58|0:17:12|Beside him, [Boss Cai's Secretary] also looked on in amazement. [Boss Cai] used his hand to shield his eyes, not wanting him to see this bloody scene. Amidst the chaos, a child eating noodles still held his bowl, when a sturdy butt suddenly bumped into him, causing him to stagger and almost fall.
0:17:12|0:17:21|Fortunately, the barbecue expert [Li Jianguo] acted quickly and caught him, along with the bowl, safely landing. He then patted the boy's head and said.
0:17:41|0:17:51|Boss Cai smiled slyly and uttered the most vicious words, the henchmen once again picked up their weapons and prepared to launch an attack on Li Jianguo. Li Jianguo firmly caught the bamboo pole stabbing towards him, standing still.
0:17:51|0:18:2|After spinning a few times, the bamboo pole was thrown out. The bamboo pole pierced through a lamb leg and then stuck on the wall. [Li Jianguo] then kicked the stove burning with charcoal under the lamb leg and successively sprinkled cumin powder.
0:18:2|0:18:22|Sprinkle chili powder and salt evenly on the lamb leg. After patting the salt on his hands, he raised both hands high like an Olympic athlete, waving and smiling at the crowd. Then he stepped back with his right leg, bent over and started running towards the direction of the lamb leg. After running a distance for takeoff, he leaped into the air and flipped over a toy goat.
0:18:22|0:18:30|With both hands grabbing the bamboo pole on the wall, Lu Xiaoyu flipped the pole like a gymnast, the lamb leg at the end refined by charcoal fire.
0:19:25|0:19:38|Lobster beauty [Sister Mei] and tech geek [Yong Jun] also joined the cooking competition. The three of them showed off their skills by making their signature dishes. [Sister Mei] was skilled and experienced, swiftly preparing a variety of spices and ingredients with a wave of her hands.
0:19:38|0:19:56|[Yong Jun] puts on protective goggles, quickly presses several switches on the machine. The two indispensable partners of instant noodles, ham sausages, pass through the fan and are cut into evenly thick slices, coated with flour, then baked in a high-temperature fire column, and fall into the instant noodle pot. [Li Jianguo] accurately controls the timing.
0:19:56|0:20:4|After the final somersault in the air, landing steadily on the ground and releasing both hands, [Sister Mei] and [Yong Jun] also completed the preparation of delicious dishes at the same time.
0:20:6|0:20:30|The exquisitely arranged dishes were placed in front of [Boss Cai], who sliced open the skin of the lamb leg, revealing the tender meat inside. The aroma wafted into the noses of his henchmen, causing someone to uncontrollably swallow saliva.
0:20:40|0:20:49|After swallowing the lamb, [Boss Cai] cracked open the lobster's head and ate it, the delicious taste spreading in his mouth.
0:20:58|0:21:7|The lingering spiciness made [Boss Cai] feel like he was back in infancy, then he tasted [Yong Jun]'s instant noodle pot, unbelievably he was conquered once again.
0:21:24|0:21:30|The taste of instant noodles brought Boss Cai back to his college days. The people behind him rushed forward after hearing it.
0:21:38|0:21:47|[Sister Mei] couldn't help but comment, just as she finished speaking a few words, the plate in front of [Boss Cai] was already empty, not even a drop of soup left.
0:21:50|0:22:2|[Boss Cai] bowed to express his gratitude, then left Fallen Street surrounded by his henchmen. Once the villagers knew it was safe, they all came out.
0:22:4|0:22:17|Boss Cai's Secretary snapped her fingers, and the villagers turned and ran, cheers turning into screams. Dozens of henchmen who had turned to leave suddenly pulled a U-turn, launching another round of destruction, sweeping through the entire street.
0:22:17|0:22:31|Li Jianguo, Sister Mei, and Yong Jun stayed in place. As a henchman prepared to strike with a heavy blow, his body suddenly leaned back and fell to the ground, hit in the face by a durian. Then, a buzzing sound of an engine came from the air.
0:22:31|0:22:47|A motorcycle roared down and came to a stop steadily on the ground. Deep in the alley, [Lu Xiaoyu] dodged around, keeping an eye on the situation on the street. He saw the person getting off the motorcycle wearing a thick muscle suit, with a helmet on his head, fighting alone and taking down one little brother after another.
0:22:47|0:23:3|Her momentum scared [Boss Cai] nearby, causing him to break out in a cold sweat. The henchmen she brought were no match for her, falling to the ground one by one. Seeing her violently throw one of the henchmen, [Lu Xiaoyu] couldn't help but widen her eyes, standing still against a cement pillar.
0:23:4|0:23:17|Thinking the fight was over, a disgruntled henchman rushed forward, only to be knocked down by just two walnuts by a man who then stuffed the walnut meat into his mouth. This man is none other than the infamous street thug known as the female Zhang Fei.
0:23:17|0:23:31|Powerful girl [Xiao Man]. The beaten henchmen scrambled away from the scene, and with a shout from [Boss Cai's Secretary], four men resembling the Four Heavenly Kings of Hong Kong appeared, [Xiao Man] quickly ran towards them.
0:23:34|0:23:52|The Four King Kong rushed towards [Boss Cai] upon seeing the situation, leaving [Boss Cai] isolated. He took the opportunity to hide in a small stall on the street. [Boss Cai] happened to see [Lu Xiaoyu] hiding in the alley, gesturing for him to charge forward. [Xiao Man] received applause.
0:23:53|0:24:1|[Lu Xiaoyu], under pressure, mustered up courage and grabbed a wooden stick before running towards the street, but the escaping Four King Kong suddenly appeared.
0:24:5|0:24:21|One person forcefully kicked open the old popcorn machine, sending it flying towards [Xiao Man]. Still immersed in the joy of victory, [Xiao Man] didn't have time to dodge. At that moment, [Lu Xiaoyu] rushed towards her and accidentally blocked the flying machine with his back.
0:24:28|0:24:48|[Lu Xiaoyu] and [Xiao Man] fell to the ground, popcorn raining down from the sky. [Lu Xiaoyu] felt dizzy and collapsed on the street, ending the chaotic night. The next day, [Lu Xiaoyu] woke up on a strange bed, hearing unclear slurping sounds in his ears. The annoying noise kept him from sleeping soundly as he slowly opened his eyes.
0:24:48|0:24:54|Seeing the person in front of him, he flapped and sat up.
0:26:47|0:26:51|Staring blankly at the roaring Xiao Tian, Lu Xiaoyu immediately grabbed and ran outside, followed by the people inside the house.
0:27:30|0:27:57|After pulling back the curtain of the door, he saw at a glance the delicious cooking secrets in [Xiao Man]'s hands. Pressed to the ground, [Lu Xiaoyu] blurted out this sentence in a moment of desperation. [Xiao Man] gradually put away her unruly smile, leaving [Yong Jun] and [Sister Mei] dumbfounded. [Li Jianguo] glared at [Lu Xiaoyu] with hatred, while [Jerry] regained his senses and ran to the balcony.
0:28:4|0:28:10|The bronze gong team and lion dance team immediately started to boil with excitement.
0:28:47|0:28:52|Hearing this, [Xiao Man] executed a shoulder throw, knocking him down to the ground.
0:31:3|0:31:8|On the street, Xiao Man holds a banknote with Lu Xiaoyu's face on it, feeling very incredulous.
0:31:13|0:31:22|Li Jianguo seized the opportunity to sneak up on Lu Xiaoyu from behind, but just as he was about to succeed, he was knocked down to the ground by Xiao Man with a fly swatter.
0:31:33|0:31:42|Sister Mei and Yong Jun arrived just in time, bowing to Lu Xiaoyu with Li Jianguo in tow. Sister Mei almost burst out laughing.
0:33:10|0:33:22|[Lu Xiaoyu] laughed and threw away the scepter in her hand, following [Xiao Man] to a ancient tree. After leaning against the tree for a while in contemplation, [Xiao Man] turned around and said to [Lu Xiaoyu].
0:33:44|0:33:48|[Xiao Man]'s lips trembled slightly, and her index fingers stirred nervously in front of her chest.
0:33:58|0:34:18|The conversation was interrupted as Lu Xiaoyu was once again knocked down to the ground. Xiao Man promptly handed the secret manual wrapped in newspaper to Lu Xiaoyu. Lu Xiaoyu and Xiao Tian looked at each other excitedly, then passed the secret to Boss Cai.
0:34:50|0:35:4|[Lu Xiaoyu] was kicked out by [Boss Cai] because of the hybrid rice knowledge given by [Xiao Man]. He returned to the decadent street with a heavy heart, determined to obtain the secret manual. However, he was pulled into the house by [Sister Mei] halfway.
0:35:37|0:35:54|[Sister Mei] turned and left, [Lu Xiaoyu] stared at the photo, and in the next moment, he suddenly realized and transformed into [Xiao Man]'s mother, wearing a flowing wig and a checkered skirt. He went to a park and made an appointment with [Xiao Man].
0:35:54|0:36:7|Xiao Man's eyes were fixed on the familiar clothes, Lu Xiaoyu turned slowly, lifting the hair on her face, only to be immediately attacked by Xiao Man.
0:37:33|0:37:40|Lu Xiaoyu, who was repeatedly interrupted during the conversation, couldn't take it anymore. He was filled with anger as he chased after the old man.
0:38:48|0:38:52|[Lu Xiaoyu] nervously followed [Xiao Man], rubbing his hands and feet, unsure of what to do.
0:39:12|0:39:24|[Lu Xiaoyu] said awkwardly, and suddenly the embassy they lived in started shaking. [Xiao Man] had already excitedly rushed to the door. At this moment, the embassy lifted off the ground and floated in mid-air. [Lu Xiaoyu] looked uneasily at everything in front of him.
0:39:30|0:39:39|On the side, [Xiao Tian] was desperately banging on the window of the crane. The drowsy crane operator completely ignored him until [Xiao Tian] climbed onto the window to get his attention.
0:39:39|0:39:55|Xiao Tian rushed into the driver's cab and fought with Master Long for control, causing the embassy to sway. Lu Xiaoyu was scared and knelt down, grabbing Xiao Man's clothes. Xiao Man, however, was particularly excited and even tried to stretch out her arms.
0:40:8|0:40:20|Xiao Tian's improper operation caused the embassy to continue shaking, but [Xiao Man] was very happy. She grabbed the railing with one hand, and stretched out the other arm, immersing herself in the excitement. [Lu Xiaoyu] kept his eyes tightly closed.
0:40:20|0:40:38|The weightless feeling made his palms sweat, his heart pounding wildly, screams escaping from his throat. After figuring out the tricks of the control lever, Xiao Tian skillfully stopped the embassy in mid-air, creating a rare moment of solitude for Lu Xiaoyu and Xiao Man. The two sat on the edge of the embassy with their legs dangling.
0:41:54|0:42:1|[Lu Xiaoyu] looked at the starry sky and fell into childhood memories.
0:42:37|0:42:51|The neighbor looked down on the leftovers brought back by Lu Xiaoyu's mom from the construction site. Lu Xiaoyu followed secretly to the site and witnessed his mother packing the leftovers. He then turned around and chose to run away from home.
0:42:54|0:43:8|On a stormy day, Lu Xiaoyu's mother anxiously searched for her son, but slipped and fell to the ground inadvertently. By the time Lu Xiaoyu arrived at the hospital, his mother had already passed away. Since that day, every time it rains, Lu Xiaoyu always has nightmares.
0:43:33|0:43:37|[Lu Xiaoyu] looked at the dog not far away, feeling a cold sweat.
0:44:24|0:44:36|The next morning, as the dawn light lifted the veil of night, the OCD-afflicted [Japanese Samurai] Master Shin Uemon arrived at Fallen Street. He was dressed in samurai attire, with 67 swords of various lengths hanging in front of him.
0:44:38|0:44:52|The bizarre and terrifying outfit scared the children on the fallen street, causing the newspaper vendors to rush into the house and lock the door. Wherever he went, no one dared to show up. He walked to the depths of the fallen street, and what he saw in front of him was a big surprise.
0:44:52|0:45:2|Li Jianguo provocatively looked at him with a bamboo pole in hand, while Sister Mei held two kitchen knives, puffing on an e-cigarette and holding a hot electric appliance from the hot water kettle.
0:45:36|0:45:49|The three-minute countdown begins, and the new right back neatly arranges the ingredients and bowls needed on the table, slowly wiping a short knife clean. [Yong Jun] and the other two coldly snort, revealing the hidden killer moves behind them.
0:45:49|0:46:3|Lu Xiaoyu and Xiao Man were seen crouching in front of a table, placing various bottles and cups on the edge of the table, letting them teeter on the dangerous edge. Xiao Tian couldn't stand it and quickly set them all upright.
0:46:44|0:46:51|But the new midfield is always missing this piece, the new right back can't stand it at all, and rushes towards the electrical control room.
0:46:52|0:47:10|With less than 7 seconds left, [Yong Jun] and his team were determined to win, shouting out in victory. The new right defender rushed back to the cooking station, panting heavily. The sword at his waist swiftly moved in and out, and in the final second, a delicate dish appeared on the table. The team looked at the complex dish in disbelief.
0:47:51|0:48:10|The new right guard used both hands and feet to passionately interpret the cooking process just now. [Lu Xiaoyu] couldn't help but exclaim. [Xiao Man], however, was amused by the new right guard's story, and the new right guard continued.
0:48:12|0:48:26|The blades were swung together, the gleam and shadow of the swords clearly visible. Food crumbs were flying in the air, and in just a few seconds, the new right guard put the knife back into the handle. At that moment, when he looked up, the timer happened to reset to zero.
0:48:26|0:48:44|Then a dish with rich ingredients and exquisite presentation was born. The rhetoric of Shin Uemon left the five people in front of him stunned. [Li Jianguo], [Sister Mei], and [Yong Jun] stepped forward, each picking up a piece of food with their chopsticks and putting it into their mouths, letting the taste of seafood spread in their mouths.
0:48:45|0:49:2|At one point, the three of them seemed to be in an underwater world, where the heads of various deep-sea fish all seemed to have turned into the brain of the New Right Gate, shouting out. The delicious seafood clouded the minds of the three, causing them to lose their senses, and all three screamed at the same time.
0:49:23|0:49:44|New Right Guard shouted loudly that he wanted to quickly get the secret manual. With New Right Guard's shout, three people fell to the ground at the same time. Lu Xiaoyu asked. Boss Cai arrived at the scene.
0:49:56|0:50:14|While talking, Boss Cai's sweater was suddenly pulled by a thread, and within seconds the entire sweater disappeared. Following the thread of the sweater, Boss Cai locked onto Jerry's snack shop. In the moment of rushing into the shop, the door was locked. The shop was pitch black, and suddenly a beam of light darted around.
0:50:14|0:50:28|A pair of eyes wandered in the darkness, [New Right Guard] swung his sword, trying to stop the scattered light spots. In the moment when the sword and the light spots touched, the lights in the room turned on, and [Jerry] was seen sitting cross-legged in mid-air.
0:50:33|0:50:52|[New Right Guard] raised his hands and the Green Dragon Cane was unexpectedly cut in half, but [Jerry] hanging in mid-air remained motionless. Everyone widened their eyes and stood still in shock at this scene. [Lu Xiaoyu] vaguely saw the fishing line in [Jerry]'s hand.
0:51:43|0:51:57|Turning around, [Jerry] was nowhere to be seen. Several doors in front of them opened one after another, and [Jerry] stood in the kitchen, throwing several colorful doughs onto the cutting board, and rhythmically patting the dough. [Lu Xiaoyu] stared intently at the scene in front of her.
0:51:58|0:52:14|[Jerry]'s hands were like sharp blades, slicing the meat evenly and dropping it into the hot pot. [Xin Youweimen] couldn't help but exclaim at the sight. [Jerry] paid no attention and proceeded to knead the other dough with the base of his palm and his elbows.
0:52:14|0:52:26|After kneading the dough, he tossed several colors of dough into the air and repeatedly slapped them, transforming the dough balls into strips. The noodles spun rapidly in the air, emitting a dazzling light.
0:52:28|0:52:33|Everyone was stunned once again after seeing it, and during this process, [Jerry] seemed to have turned into a young teenager.
0:53:0|0:53:15|The noodles can be stretched infinitely long, long enough to wrap around the Earth. [Jerry] then knits the thin noodles into a fabric shape. This is the first time [Xiao Man] has seen [Jerry] do this, her mouth has been open since the beginning. In no time, the noodles are cooked.
0:53:29|0:53:48|The new right back held a bowl, picked up a colorful noodle with chopsticks, and couldn't stop after taking a bite. After satisfyingly finishing the last sip of soup, he exhaled a hot breath, neatly placed the empty bowl and chopsticks on the table, then knelt down with a thud, his mouth twitching, tears continuously flowing from his eyes.
0:53:58|0:54:17|They listened attentively as the New Right Defender continued. With his narration, the scene shifted back to when [Jerry] and [Tom] were young, as the New Right Defender kept on speaking.
0:55:22|0:55:29|Turning around and picking up the money counter to start counting, the secretary understood Boss Cai's expression and immediately called the Four King Kong.
0:55:42|0:55:49|With a scream from [Jerry], the camera pulls away from his face. We see four short knives stuck in the back of [Lu Xiaoyu].
0:55:59|0:56:3|The Four King Kong escaped from the snack shop in an orderly manner, upside down.
0:56:28|0:56:32|Just as he finished speaking, [Boss Cai] was suddenly dressed in a full-body knitted suit.
0:57:15|0:57:27|[Lu Xiaoyu] stuffed a piece of bread in his mouth to bite on, trying to alleviate the pain, while [Xiao Man] applied wound medicine to her hands, preparing to treat him.
0:57:32|0:57:38|[Xiao Man] applied the medicine on his wound, seeing no response, she poked him twice with her fingers.
0:58:10|0:58:27|Upon being discovered by [Xiao Man], [Lu Xiaoyu] picked up the brick beside him. Without much thought, [Lu Xiaoyu] immediately stood up upon hearing the words, the brick slipping from his hand. After mentally preparing himself, he spoke.
0:58:59|0:59:5|Knowing all this, [Xiao Man] not only wasn't angry, but also happily held [Lu Xiaoyu]'s hand and entered the circle.
0:59:10|0:59:19|[Xiao Man] recalls every moment when [Lu Xiaoyu] confessed his love to her and she agreed.
1:0:44|1:0:49|[Xiao Man] hadn't finished speaking when she turned her head and [Lu Xiaoyu] had already disappeared.
1:2:31|1:2:47|[Lu Xiaoyu] ignored [Xiao Tian]'s advice and in a fit of anger, stepped on [Xiao Tian]'s robotic cat, causing it to break. [Xiao Tian] picked up the robotic cat and walked away. After packing up his belongings, [Xiao Tian] said angrily. [Lu Xiaoyu] sneered and threw out a harsh remark.
1:2:48|1:3:3|[Xiao Tian] left with a pout, leaving [Lu Xiaoyu] looking incredulous. As [Xiao Tian] walked out the door, he threw the deposit from [Boss Cai] towards him. He looked down at the money and then at the entrance. Realizing that [Xiao Tian] had truly left this time,
1:3:3|1:3:11|He helplessly placed his hands on his hips, then looked up at the night sky. Xiao Man stood on the balcony, gazing at the same sky as him.
1:3:11|1:3:29|After a while, [Lu Xiaoyu] arrived at the entrance of the funeral parlor. The funeral parlor was eerily quiet at night, with the occasional caw of a crow breaking the silence. Beads of sweat formed on [Lu Xiaoyu]'s forehead, but he still walked in. Looking around, the hallways were filled with various wreaths and paper figures.
1:3:29|1:3:42|Sweat had soaked his face, neck, and even his close-fitting short sleeves. He walked towards the end of the dim corridor, occasionally turning around to look back. He seemed to hear terrifying howls and women's laughter.
1:3:42|1:3:59|He then lowered his head, closed his eyes, and quickly ran forward. After entering a door, he looked back in the direction he had just come from. After observing that nothing strange came out, he breathed a sigh of relief. He patted his chest, turned around, and what he saw in front of him made him break out in a cold sweat, his lips trembling.
1:3:59|1:4:8|An accidental intrusion led to a morgue. [Lu Xiaoyu] slowly turned around to leave, but the door that had just closed wouldn't budge.
1:4:8|1:4:20|After shaking it hard a few times and finding the door still wouldn't open, he turned around and quickly spotted the emergency exit across from him. Looking at the bodies on both sides, he grimaced and swallowed hard.
1:4:20|1:4:30|Clearing his throat again, Lu Xiaoyu took a shaky step forward, carefully moving towards the body in front of him. He stared at the nearby corpse before quickly averting his gaze.
1:4:52|1:5:11|Suddenly, four bodies next to him leaned towards him, and [Lu Xiaoyu] couldn't grab them directly facing the ground. When he was about to regain consciousness, he slowly opened his eyes and saw a sign in front of him with the word "soup" written on it.
1:5:13|1:5:27|He fell to the ground, his consciousness not fully awake yet. The scene in front of his eyes was bizarre and surreal, with a large spoonful of soup placed in front of him.
1:7:10|1:7:29|Lu Xiaoyu's words successfully angered him, his eyes instantly turned bloodshot, and he forcefully grabbed Lu Xiaoyu's neck, feeding the customer a bowl of soup full of chili. The customer smashed the bowl on the ground, and their emotions immediately spiraled out of control, their actions becoming extremely frenzied.
1:7:29|1:7:45|[Tom], upon learning the news from [Lu Xiaoyu], quickly changed her outfit. She tied up her messy hair, put on a cheongsam, and followed [Boss Cai] and others to the entrance of the snack shop. However, she hesitated to go in, nervously rubbing her hands on her abdomen.
1:8:40|1:8:51|Listening to the voices coming from the shop, with Boss Cai's encouragement and Tom's fists clenched, anger emanated from him, causing the house to tremble. Tom pushed open the door and appeared in front of Jerry in an instant.
1:9:5|1:9:14|Hearing [Jerry] accurately calling out his own name, Tom observes carefully.
1:10:11|1:10:27|Former lovers who were once inseparable are now at odds, with [Tom] filled with hatred in his eyes. With a swift motion, he flings the wooden pot lid towards [Jerry], who catches it steadily and hurls it aside, narrowly missing [Boss Cai]'s head and shaving off a piece of his hair.
1:10:27|1:10:39|[Xiao Man] laughed at the wrong time, but stopped when she saw no one else was laughing. The competition officially began, with [Tom] taking the lead. She threw several chili bombs into the pot, and they exploded in the hot pot.
1:10:39|1:10:50|The broth instantly turned blood red, while [Jerry] casually sprinkled a few spices into the pot, making it look effortless but with hidden turmoil.
1:10:50|1:11:1|The impact of the seasoning broke through the iron pot, turning the soup into the color of milk. The soup in the big pot became distinctly separated, with the spicy pot and the clear soup pot engaging in a taste battle.
1:11:1|1:11:19|[Tom] increases the firepower, and several fierce wolves appear in the spicy pot broth, roaring ferociously. One of the wolves leaps into the air, leaving [Jerry] terrified. He quickly reacts by increasing the firepower and adding a few lily leaves into the pot, causing the broth to immediately boil and bubble.
1:11:20|1:11:32|The wolf in the spicy pot launched an attack, trying to cross the boundary of the mandarin duck pot. Just as it was about to leap over, a white crane slowly rose from the clear soup, spreading its huge wings to block the wolf's attack.
1:11:32|1:11:49|The wolf fell back into the spicy pot, merging with the broth, while the white crane stewed back into the clear soup, and the boiling broth returned to calm. [Tom] showed no signs of backing down, and with full force, she placed several abnormal chili peppers in the pot. Dozens of wolves suddenly appeared and dashed towards the clear soup pot.
1:11:49|1:12:2|[Jerry] added lily bulbs and tremella into the clear soup pot. The white crane stretched its long neck over the boundary, trying to intimidate the wolf. However, the wolf disregarded the boundary and jumped into the clear soup pot, biting tightly onto the white crane's wings.
1:12:2|1:12:13|White Crane screamed in pain, flapping its wings and knocking the evil wolf back into the hot pot. The pot returned to calm, leaving Boss Cai and others stunned by this thrilling showdown.
1:12:13|1:12:24|The fallen street residents widened their eyes in disbelief as they watched the scene before them. Before everyone could come to their senses, Tom gathered various fresh and spicy seasonings and threw them all into the pot.
1:12:24|1:12:39|The soup in the hot pot began to bubble, with many triangular shapes resembling spikes emerging, followed by a shape resembling a claw. Accompanied by strange noises, a monster with terrifying horns on its head and layers of patterns on its back emerged from the soup.
1:12:39|1:12:44|Its mouth, with its interlocking fangs, roared while also splattering out some extremely spicy soup.
1:12:46|1:12:59|[Tom] was controlling the monster ready to attack, when suddenly a golden light appeared from the opposite side, piercing through the monster mercilessly. The hot soup splattered on [Boss Cai]'s face, he wiped it off expressionlessly with a handkerchief, then looked at the character transformed by [Jerry].
1:13:7|1:13:18|Tom once again exerted his power to prepare for a counterattack, while Jerry also used his skills to resist. Suddenly, the two forces broke through the boundaries in the pot, and the past of Jerry and Tom's youth immediately emerged.
1:13:18|1:13:33|At that time, the two of them were brewing the same pot of soup together, with [Jerry] standing behind [Tom], his body close to hers, both holding the same ladle immersed in the atmosphere of love, even adding seasoning to the soup was filled with a sweet scent.
1:13:33|1:13:43|When Tom was smoked in the eyes, Jerry was very annoyed and quickly extinguished the fire. Tom wiped away the tears caused by the smoke, and looked at the extinguished fire on the stove, asking.
1:13:49|1:14:6|The two people in love looked at each other with silly smiles, their eyes filled with each other. But now, the two elderly people's eyes were full of hatred. Similar actions, similar scenes, made the powerful Tom recall his youth. In this match, he
1:14:6|1:14:21|In the end, she softened her heart. Tears kept rolling in her eyes, and her choked voice caught the attention of [Jerry]. He looked at [Tom], but Tom increased the firepower, and the shockwave knocked Jerry to the ground. A tear from Tom fell into the soup.
1:14:21|1:14:36|The spicy broth quickly spread throughout the pot, engulfing the clear broth pot, turning the entire pot into a spicy pot. [Tom] gritted his teeth and glared fiercely at the blood-spitting [Jerry].
1:15:0|1:15:14|[Xiao Man] disregarded everything and walked to the pot with a ladle in hand. [Tom] couldn't help but snort at her youthful arrogance. [Xiao Man] made a confident gesture towards the old man and the people on the decadent street behind her, then scooped up half a ladle of soup with the ladle.
1:15:14|1:15:19|As it got closer to her mouth, she couldn't help but take a sharp breath. At this moment, she had no way out.
1:15:19|1:15:34|Tom and Boss Cai looked disdainful as Lu Xiaoyu bravely drank the spicy soup from the spoon, while the people on the decadent street watched her with pity. Xiao Man wiped her mouth with the scarf around her neck, let out a satisfied sigh, and smugly looked at the people around her.
1:15:35|1:15:46|Suddenly she felt something was wrong, the soup that had just gone down burned her stomach, a hot sensation shot straight to her head, her throat was also being roasted, she opened her mouth not knowing what to do.
1:16:22|1:16:36|After the crowd, a man walked up, although he was looking down, [Xiao Man] still recognized him at a glance, he was the one who had been away for more than 36 hours, [Lu Xiaoyu].
1:16:49|1:16:58|[Boss Cai] clenched his fists and started punching and kicking [Lu Xiaoyu] after speaking, but [Lu Xiaoyu] didn't fight back, just kept using his hands to protect his head.
1:17:6|1:17:22|Boss Cai kicked Lu Xiaoyu in front of Xiao Man. Xiao Man clenched her fists, and as soon as Tom finished speaking, she couldn't hold back anymore. She rushed towards Lu Xiaoyu, who fearfully raised his hands to defend himself.
1:17:22|1:17:30|[Xiao Man] passed by, and her fist landed heavily on [Boss Cai]'s head, which was something [Tom] never expected.
1:17:42|1:17:47|[Xiao Man] walked towards [Lu Xiaoyu] after venting her emotions.
1:18:5|1:18:23|[Xiao Man] reminded [Lu Xiaoyu] of the night they first met. When the popcorn machine was flying towards her, she saw with her own eyes that [Lu Xiaoyu] could have dodged it, but he still rushed to her without hesitation and shielded her from the machine. [Lu Xiaoyu] sighed, struggled in his heart for a moment, and said,
1:18:46|1:19:3|After [Xiao Man] finished speaking, she turned her back to [Lu Xiaoyu] and reached out a hand behind her. [Lu Xiaoyu] lowered his head to look at [Xiao Man]'s hand reaching towards him, feeling conflicted inside. He slowly reached out his hand, but then stopped halfway in the air. After a moment of hesitation, he finally grabbed [Xiao Man]'s hand.
1:19:3|1:19:22|[Xiao Man] finally got his reply, smiling as he turned to look at [Lu Xiaoyu]. However, [Lu Xiaoyu] had a fierce look in his eyes as he forcefully pulled her towards him, just like how [Xiao Man] used to treat him. He grabbed her arm and forcefully threw her into the air, executing a 180-degree shoulder throw. [Xiao Man] landed heavily on the ground.
1:19:22|1:19:29|At this moment, he seemed to have lost his sense of pain just like [Lu Xiaoyu], devoid of awareness, only staring blankly at the sky.
1:19:34|1:19:40|[Lu Xiaoyu] coldly finished this sentence, and [Boss Cai] and others burst into laughter. But the tears on [Lu Xiaoyu]'s face had already betrayed him.
1:19:43|1:19:59|[Xiao Man] lay despairingly on the ground, as the people of Fallen Street shouted her name and moved towards her position, then the entire Fallen Street plunged into darkness. [Boss Cai] led the construction team to thoroughly sweep Fallen Street, [Li Jianguo]'s barbecue shop collapsed with a bang, and [Jerry]'s snack bar also ceased to exist.
1:19:59|1:20:15|Instead, Shanzong Group's reputation soared, not only did the company expand rapidly, but also received the blessing of [Tom]. Newspapers harshly criticized [Jerry] for burning the secret manual and destroying cultural heritage. [Boss Cai] cleaned up the dirty and messy fallen street, allowing him to make a fortune.
1:20:15|1:20:29|While [Lu Xiaoyu] lurked in the bar every day, a glamorous woman dressed in a cold manner swayed in front of him, enveloping the entire bar in a ambiguous atmosphere. [Xiao Man] sat in a hospital bed wearing patient clothes, with a table full of food in front of her.
1:20:29|1:20:43|She picked up a donut and took a bite, then grabbed a chicken nugget and stuffed it into her mouth. Before she could swallow, she picked up a hamburger and took a bite, with her cheeks bulging on both sides. The departure of [Lu Xiaoyu] reminded her of the scene when her mother left when she was a child.
1:20:43|1:21:3|She could only wait for her mother to come back while swallowing food in big gulps, also waiting for [Lu Xiaoyu]. But as she ate, a surge of bitterness welled up in her heart, [Xiao Man] burst into tears, unable to hold back her sobs, with the food in her mouth falling all over the table.
1:21:3|1:21:14|At the end of the banquet, [Lu Xiaoyu] sat alone at the table, looking at the leftovers on the table. Like [Xiao Man] in the hospital, he couldn't help but burst into tears, tears streaming down uncontrollably.
1:21:15|1:21:23|He recalled the night he spent alone with [Xiao Man] when he ran away from home in a heavy rainstorm.
1:21:30|1:21:42|At this moment, he seemed to understand Xiao Man's words. His unconscious body woke up, his heart started to convulse violently, the pain tearing at his nerves, throwing him into a flood of memories filled with Xiao Man.
1:22:7|1:22:29|When the memory flashed back to the day when [Jerry] and [Tom] were competing, and he pushed [Xiao Man] to the ground, he almost couldn't breathe. The violent throbbing of his heart made him unable to stop scratching his chest, and his body was forced to curl up in the chair. He passed out in the memories full of [Xiao Man], and when he regained consciousness, he found himself on Xiao Tian's back.
1:23:47|1:24:1|[Jerry] said that the culinary god he mentioned is [Lu Xiaoyu]. [Lu Xiaoyu] has been suffering from heart disease after a serious injury, rolling in pain on the bed. Xiao Tian, seeing this, was deeply saddened, feeling that [Lu Xiaoyu] wouldn't make it through.
1:24:1|1:24:13|After a whole night passed, dawn finally arrived. [Lu Xiaoyu] stood on the embassy and looked into the distance. A heart attack unexpectedly opened his Governor Vessel, giving him the superpower of culinary skills.
1:24:13|1:24:27|The glaring morning sun and the crowing of the rooster disturbed Xiao Tian's peaceful dream. He rubbed his eyes, sat up groggily, and immediately widened his eyes upon seeing Lu Xiaoyu standing on the embassy. He quickly woke up and exclaimed excitedly.
1:24:43|1:25:4|To be on the safe side, the two of them arrived at a nearby snack stall, where the vendor was whistling leisurely, preparing ingredients. Xiao Tian covered his mouth and nose from behind and pulled him away. Lu Xiaoyu then came to the snack stall to show off his skills. He threw the kitchen knife up and caught it agilely.
1:25:4|1:25:17|Flying towards the cutting board. Under his knife, the ingredients seemed to come alive, flying into the air one after another, while staring at the spatula waving with powerful arms. The two people behind him were already dumbfounded, and in no time, a meal was ready.
1:25:19|1:25:29|[Xiao Tian] picked up a chopstick and stuffed it into the mouth of the small vendor, took a bite himself, chewed a few times, and then both of them spat it out.
1:25:48|1:26:4|The street vendor and [Xiao Tian] continued to wrestle. [Lu Xiaoyu] felt extremely heavy-hearted, as he heard Boss Cai's voice coming from the vendor's radio. Boss Cai was singing on the stage of a press conference, while the host with an explosive hairstyle stood beside him, speaking emotionally.
1:26:38|1:26:43|The three judges from the Culinary Association arrived at the scene and were guided to their seats by the staff.
1:26:56|1:27:5|The etiquette lady first presented Mr. Dong with a bouquet of flowers, then placed the certificate on the table in front of him. He took off his pen cap, ready to sign.
1:27:8|1:27:22|Wearing traditional Chinese clothing, [Lu Xiaoyu] was suspended in the air and suddenly appeared on the stage. He rushed towards [Boss Cai], but got stuck in mid-air because the rope was too short.
1:27:27|1:27:40|The crew member handling the wire didn't control the strength well, causing [Lu Xiaoyu] to fall face down on the stage. He pushed himself up with both hands and faced [Boss Cai] directly. Seeing the atmosphere was off, the stage crew on both sides hurriedly retreated.
1:27:53|1:27:57|[Boss Cai] looked towards [Tom] on the stage, and [Tom] nodded at him.
1:28:8|1:28:15|A large group of reporters below swarmed up, pointing their microphones and cameras at him.
1:29:17|1:29:26|Just now, Sister Mei, Li Jianguo, and Yong Jun, who were playing mahjong in the hospital room, have now appeared on the scene.
1:31:14|1:31:24|Seeing Lu Xiaoyu with a foreign aid, Boss Cai couldn't help but snort coldly. After the fish head was placed on the table, Lu Xiaoyu had the winning ticket in hand. He knew he was no longer the same Lu Xiaoyu as before.
1:32:8|1:32:25|The small vendor was fighting with [Xiao Tian] again, [Lu Xiaoyu] looked at his own hands, lightly touched one hand's palm with a finger, feeling the pain quickly spreading, he then confirmed that he had regained consciousness, and immediately tore off the necklace with a dollar sign on his neck. The shadow of the necklace was reflected on the wall.
1:32:27|1:32:35|The dollar sign is torn apart and split into a pair of chopsticks and the letter "s". On stage, he wears a necklace and clothes given by [Xiao Man].
1:32:46|1:32:55|The scene was quiet, with only [Xiao Tian] shouting hoarsely in the audience, cheering wildly for [Lu Xiaoyu]. [Lu Xiaoyu] rolled up his sleeves and placed his hand on a fish head.
1:33:4|1:33:14|Jianguo and the others saw his actions and thought he was abnormal. [Lu Xiaoyu] reached for the last fish head, and [Tom] also found it unbelievable.
1:33:32|1:33:39|[Lu Xiaoyu] decided to use this fish head. He cut open the fish head, and the fish meat immediately emitted a dazzling light.
1:34:43|1:34:56|Boss Cai couldn't stop laughing in the audience, but the next scene made him immediately stop. A device was quickly assembled on stage, and the fish head was placed inside.
1:35:17|1:35:32|The fuse on the aircraft was ignited, and a large fire burst out from the bottom, with thick smoke spreading. The aircraft broke through the glass of the venue and successfully flew the Fish Head King into the sky. Master [Tom]'s mixed stew hotpot is ready.
1:35:59|1:36:5|The aircraft suddenly landed, causing [Boss Cai]'s hair to be blown apart, with smoke rising between the strands.
1:36:16|1:36:28|Tom's pot feast melee and Lu Xiaoyu's Seven Dragon Ball Fish Head King are officially served on the table, the aroma of the two dishes spreading out, the judges and the audience are all immersed in the fragrance.
1:36:47|1:36:53|Mr. Dong's spoon left the Dragon Ball Fish Head King and turned to Tom's basin feast, and the other two judges also started to taste it.
1:37:15|1:37:36|Suddenly, there was a dramatic twist in the scene. The taste of the basin dish continued to fiercely suppress the aura of the Fish Head King. After several rounds of confrontation, the taste of the Fish Head King still couldn't revive, being overwhelmed by the taste of the basin dish. The once incredibly delicious Fish Head King now only tasted like dried fish.
1:37:42|1:37:51|The three judges ruthlessly criticized the taste of the fish head king, and [Boss Cai] seemed to have succeeded in his scheme, a cunning smile appearing on his face.
1:37:56|1:38:14|The three judges were still enjoying the basin feast, a scene that caught [Tom] completely off guard. [Lu Xiaoyu] and others were very puzzled by this result. They all walked off the stage and tasted the flavor of the Fish Head King.
1:38:16|1:38:30|[Lu Xiaoyu] scooped up a spoonful of [Tom]'s dish and put it into his mouth. Instantly, he sensed something was wrong as his mouth was filled with the taste of chemical additives. [Boss Cai] leaned in close to his ear and whispered,
1:38:49|1:38:56|[Boss Cai] deliberately poured the hot water from the thermos on [Lu Xiaoyu]'s arm.
1:39:19|1:39:37|[Xiao Man] pushed [Jerry] in a wheelchair to the press conference, but they were stopped by security guards at the door. Amidst the argument, she happened to see [Lu Xiaoyu], who was pushed into the kitchen by four people and locked behind a heavy iron door.
1:40:4|1:40:11|[Xiao Man] appeared at the scene holding some chili sauce, but no one knew when she arrived.
1:40:34|1:40:50|The scene shifts to the kitchen where [Lu Xiaoyu] is working. He is stirring chili sauce by hand, the pain from the chili on his skin making him sweat profusely. It also brings back memories of his childhood, when his mother used the same method to make chili sauce.
1:41:20|1:41:26|After the final baptism of hot oil, the chili sauce in the hands of the audience and judges was born.
1:42:27|1:42:33|The chili sauce godmother hidden in the audience stands up with a halo above her head, speaking earnestly.
1:44:21|1:44:29|Tom angrily flipped open the manual, only to find it filled with portraits of her and Jerry.
1:45:0|1:45:16|The USB drive actually contained pictures of Tom and Jerry. [Boss Cai] was taken away by the police, and the audience below applauded and cheered. [Xiao Man], [Li Jianguo], and others happily surrounded [Jerry] to celebrate.
1:45:16|1:45:26|Due to directly touching the chili peppers, [Lu Xiaoyu] couldn't hold on and eventually passed out. [Xiao Man] hurriedly ran towards him.
1:45:27|1:45:34|[Lu Xiaoyu] smiled as he thought [Xiao Man] would give him artificial respiration, but to his surprise, when he opened his eyes.
1:45:44|1:45:54|[Lu Xiaoyu] pushed aside [Xiao Tian], and [Li Jianguo] also joined in, trying to press him down. [Yong Jun] helped [Li Jianguo] grab [Lu Xiaoyu]'s hand, and [Xiao Man] couldn't rescue him. The people on the stage were having fun and playing around, creating a harmonious scene.
1:46:8|1:46:14|[Xiao Man] pouted and leaned close to [Lu Xiaoyu], but [Lu Xiaoyu] winced and kept backing away.
