0:1:26|0:1:44|On this day, the sky was clear and the air was refreshing. In the training ground of Luoyang City, the imperial guards were lined up in formation, with court ladies holding embroidered umbrellas and royal canopies, standing by the side of the imperial carriage. The Emperor of the Great Tang Dynasty, [Tang Gao Zong], and the Empress Dowager [Wu Zetian], dressed in luxurious attire, stood on the platform, overlooking the bustling city below.
0:1:44|0:2:3|A man wearing a black headscarf and court attire knelt down to express gratitude for the imperial favor. He then lifted the dragon-headed mace bestowed by the emperor, slowly stood up, and faced the soldiers to demonstrate in the name of [Tang Gao Zong]. This man is Di Renjie, the chief of the Supreme Court, which is the highest judicial institution in the Tang Dynasty responsible for handling state affairs and judicial matters.
0:2:3|0:2:16|The investigation of all unsolved cases is handled by the Supreme Court, equivalent to the current Supreme People's Court. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is honored as the director, with the saying "Riding a dragon to control the comparison with the emperor," implying that if the real dragon is far away, it will slacken the government's affairs.
0:2:16|0:2:27|The Dragon Spine symbolizes fairness and justice, impartiality. All the people of the Tang Dynasty, commoners, officials, and even members of the royal family who harm the state can be admonished with this Dragon Spine.
0:2:27|0:2:42|The scene shifts to the Great Court of Justice, where [Di Renjie] is holding a piece of soft wood, covering his hand on his back and standing under an apricot tree. He continuously strikes following the trajectory of the falling apricot leaves, with leaves covering the ground all around him. The leaves on the ground are crisp and intact.
0:2:42|0:2:58|In the air, leaves were dancing, and [Di Renjie] also missed his strike. His skills were extraordinary, but it was unclear why he practiced martial arts in this way. On the other side of the imperial city, during a meal in the palace, [Wu Zetian] flew into a rage and threw the precious dishes and delicacies on the table to the ground.
0:2:58|0:3:5|[Tang Gao Zong] did not take offense, he smiled and stepped back, while [Wu Zetian] stood up and glared at [Tang Gao Zong], saying,
0:3:12|0:3:16|After saying that, [Wu Zetian] kicked away the bowls and wine cups at her feet and walked out of the hall.
0:3:43|0:4:0|Upon hearing the words of [Tang Gao Zong], [Wu Zetian] stopped in her tracks and turned to look at him, her expression still stubborn but with tears in her eyes. As a series of hurried hoofbeats echoed, night fell upon the palace city.
0:4:42|0:4:51|At this point, [Yuchi Zhenjin] led [Wu Zetian] to a courtyard.
0:5:12|0:5:27|[Wu Zetian] said so, and then saw the four people kneeling in the dark courtyard stand up. The leader was dressed in coarse cloth robes with a crown on his head. Taking a few steps forward, he shook the duster in his hand, and two fireballs appeared in his palms when he reached out his arms from his back.
0:5:27|0:5:40|Then he threw it to the ground for illumination. Beside [Huan Tian], a strong man walked in the firelight, only to see him wielding dual crescent moon blades and roaring forward. [Yuchi Zhenjin] feared his malicious intentions, causing harm to [Wu Zetian].
0:5:40|0:5:50|With the sword drawn to protect, the barbarian man in the group saw the situation and threw his weapon into the air, heading straight towards [Wu Zetian]. [Yuchi Zhenjin] stood in the way, spinning his sword, solely on the defensive.
0:5:50|0:6:3|Di Renjie saw the twin moon blades suddenly disappear in front of him, only to strike from behind. He quickly dodged and the barbarian man from the Fan tribe retrieved the twin blades on his back, bowing and saying.
0:6:3|0:6:22|Then an old woman with a ghostly face raised her hand, and sparks filled the air wherever her palms faced. With unparalleled heat, she thrust her palms towards the sky, and the sparks bloomed like brilliant fireworks in the night sky. Looking up, one could see Sanskrit burning in the night sky, and upon closer inspection, it was revealed that the Sanskrit pointed to Bodhisattva Samantabhadra.
0:6:28|0:6:31|The old woman's level of skill made [Wu Zetian] take notice.
0:6:33|0:6:55|The spark faded away, and a strange man dressed as a scholar appeared, waving his sleeves to conjure up wine bottles and jugs out of thin air, placing them on the table. He then waved his hand to push a wine cup, as light as a feather, floating and landing on the blade of [Yuchi Zhenjin]. He spoke and poured from the silver jug, but the wine seemed to flow out from the jug's mouth without a visible destination.
0:6:55|0:7:2|Surely enough, as the cup on the knife gradually filled up, [Yuchi Zhenjin] raised his knife and forcefully split the cup in half, shouting,
0:7:10|0:7:17|After listening, Yuchi Zhenjin walked up to the Empress and bowed, saying,
0:7:53|0:8:10|Then he suddenly noticed something strange about the shadow of the empress, and saw ripples in the darkness as if water was flowing. [Yuchi Zhenjin] shouted loudly. With that, he drew the long knife from his waist and pointed it towards the mysterious figure in the shadows. Seeing the attackers with knives approaching, a hand suddenly reached out from the empress's shadow, controlling the flying darts.
0:8:10|0:8:31|Seeing the long knife being deflected, [Yuchi Zhenjin] leaped into the air and threw several flying knives, forcing the person to retreat from the shadow of the Empress. Holding two knives, he was about to capture the night walker when the person lightly stepped on the ground and floated into the air. Regardless of others, this light skill was truly extraordinary. The night walker was skilled in using hidden weapons, continuously throwing flying darts and entangling with [Yuchi Zhenjin].
0:8:31|0:8:43|Seizing the opportunity, [Yuchi Zhenjin] used his unparalleled light skills to fly onto the city tower. Just as he had not yet stabilized his figure, [Yuchi Zhenjin] threw a flying knife, nailing it along with the veil of the night walker to the railing of the city tower.
0:8:43|0:8:52|The outcome is clear. The Nightwalker retreated, his black robe floating down as he spoke. [Yuchi Zhenjin] paid no attention, sheathed his sword, and engaged in conversation.
0:9:31|0:9:36|The Empress's words concealed a profound mystery, and after hearing them, [Yuchi Zhenjin] shuddered and fell silent.
0:9:56|0:10:15|The officials were slightly puzzled, but soon they rode with [Di Renjie] to rush to Lengyuzhai. Just out of the Dali Temple, the whereabouts of the crowd had already entered the eyes of the exotic people under the command of the Empress. When [Di Renjie] left, [Yuchi Zhenjin] sat on the horse and threw a paper package to the hunchbacked old woman who was good at using flames, and then said.
0:10:22|0:10:32|[Gui Ye] remained silent, just staring at him with a sinister smile. [Yuchi Zhenjin] ignored him and rode away, at this moment a faint spell appeared on the ground.
0:10:32|0:10:49|In the corner tower, the female assassin [Shui Yue], who was responsible for monitoring the movements of the Dali Temple, sensed something amiss. She flipped over and leaped down from the corner tower beam, leaning against the side platform to observe. Below, in the bustling market, pedestrians and carriages hurried past, all unaware of the unusual activity on the ground. Seeing [Gui Ye] ascending the corner tower, [Shui Yue] spoke up and asked,
0:10:54|0:11:12|[Gui Ye] remained silent, smiling slyly. The scene followed his sinister laughter to the outside of Leng Yu Chamber. It was late at night, and three guards were waiting at the entrance, holding lanterns. When they saw [Di Renjie] approaching on horseback, they stepped forward to lead the group into Leng Yu Chamber.
0:11:49|0:12:7|Stepping over the threshold, he looked around and saw numerous clues left by the criminals in the courtyard. The mansion gate was broken, footprints were clear in the courtyard. These traces, seen by [Di Renjie], became tools for solving the case. In just a few moments, he had already imagined the whereabouts of the perpetrator in his mind.
0:12:7|0:12:22|They are numerous in number, and early this morning they forcibly broke into the Cold Jade Chamber when no one was around. They showed no restraint as they leaped and jumped around in the pine forest, strange rocks, narrow paths, and low walls, exposing numerous flaws and leaving behind countless traces.
0:12:22|0:12:41|[Di Renjie] felt strange and stopped to observe the courtyard. He carefully deduced the movements of the criminals in his mind. Suddenly, he saw a world of his own, with countless figures in black coming and going in the Cold Jade Pavilion. After confirming that nothing was overlooked, he entered the room with others and found numerous traces in the hall as well.
0:12:41|0:12:44|[Di Renjie] couldn't help but speak out,
0:12:48|0:13:4|Hearing what [Di Renjie] said, a railway police officer was about to speak but was interrupted by another waving his hand, while [Yuchi Zhenjin] outside the door smiled without saying a word. The conversation of [Di Renjie] and his group alarmed the owner of the Cold Jade Chamber, who at this moment was like a startled bird, sitting behind the speaking platform in a panic, shouting,
0:13:14|0:13:34|While the police officer was questioning Mr. Leng according to the law, [Di Renjie] crouched on the ground with great interest to examine a footprint. At the same time, outside the Dali Temple, [Gui Ye] and [Shui Yue] took advantage of the darkness to prepare to sneak into the temple to find the Dragon Spine, the two of them leaped from the market canopy, disappearing without a trace.
0:13:38|0:13:49|Just as the on-duty constable was attracted by the twinkling stars in the sky, two figures wrapped in black cloth descended from above, falling into the Grand Court of Justice like scattered night.
0:13:49|0:14:0|It was [Gui Ye] and [Shui Yue] who, following the route instructed by [Yuchi Zhenjin], evaded the patrolling guards by turning into a cloud of smoke and silently sneaked into [Di Renjie]'s residence.
0:14:16|0:14:24|After that, [Gui Ye] took the lead in searching the bedroom, while on the other side, the police officer was still questioning Mr. Leng about the matter.
0:15:18|0:15:22|The nearby Di Renjie hurriedly lit a lamp to inspect, only to see a painting falling out from under the table.
0:15:24|0:15:30|Fearful of hidden secrets under the table, Di Renjie kicked over the painting table with one foot, alerting his companions outside.
0:15:40|0:15:54|[Di Renjie] saw the situation and quickly shouted at him, but it was already too late, the guard had been poisoned. Another guard pulled out a steel rod for self-defense. [Di Renjie] instructed his subordinates to be vigilant.
0:15:56|0:16:5|Outside the house, the well-trained police officers rely on each other, checking the surroundings with the crossbows on their waists. At this moment, [Di Renjie] suddenly foams at the mouth, convulses, and dies.
0:16:8|0:16:23|Two railway police officers were about to step forward to help, but suddenly realized the situation, so they loudly warned everyone. Amidst the chaos, [Di Renjie] remained remarkably calm. He listened intently and suddenly heard a faint noise from the roof. He looked up to observe, just as the two railway police officers were examining Mr. Leng's body.
0:16:23|0:16:44|[Di Renjie] shouted to the crowd inside and outside. As soon as the words fell, outside the house, the patrolmen discovered a figure in black robes walking on the roof. They quickly shot their crossbows and hit the person, who fell into the courtyard. As the smoke cleared from the roof, a figure emerged, it was none other than the skilled member of the Yi Ren Zu, [Fei Yan].
0:17:43|0:17:50|[Huan Tian] intercepted [Ba Dao], who was about to engage in combat with [Yuchi Zhenjin], then leaped towards the wall and turned into a mist, disappearing from sight.
0:17:50|0:18:2|[Ba Dao], who is not good at illusions, carries two knives on his back and leaves by leaping over roofs. On the other side, [Di Renjie] leads the patrolman Yuchi Zhenjin to continue chasing [Fei Yan]. It is curfew time, and the city of Luoyang in the Tang Dynasty is dimly lit.
0:18:2|0:18:19|The streets were empty, with four people chasing each other. When Di Renjie ran out of sight, Fei Yan leaped down from the roof, using magic to transform into women's clothing in mid-air and quietly landing. Little did they know, there were guards behind Di Renjie, with two police officers following closely. They were soon discovered and trapped in the alley.
0:18:19|0:18:26|[Di Renjie] noticed that no one was following him, so he knew the plan was successful and hurried back to this place.
0:18:30|0:18:47|After Yibei and Zhou Jin tied up [Fei Yan], Di Renjie kicked her out without hesitation. A spherical hidden weapon rolled towards the three of them, small but incredibly powerful. With just one kick, it could shatter walls and tiles, truly terrifying. The others quickly dodged out of the way.
0:18:49|0:18:57|[Fei Yan] finished speaking and, ignoring the ropes still wrapped around him, fought with [Di Renjie]. Seeing the hidden weapons on the wall moving, Yi An shouted loudly.
0:19:0|0:19:11|As soon as the words fell, several hidden weapons were seen attached to the wall, opening up like lotus flowers, with light balls hidden inside, spraying out an unnamed liquid towards Di Renjie and Yuchi Zhenjin, making it difficult for the two of them to break free for the time being.
0:19:11|0:19:22|Fortunately, [Di Renjie] is skilled in martial arts and is able to suppress [Fei Yan] at every turn. Feeling unable to gain the upper hand, [Fei Yan] finds it difficult and decides to create some distance. As she tries to use her inner strength, she realizes that her hands are as hard as iron and she is momentarily unable to move.
0:19:22|0:19:29|In recalling the recent battle, it was just noticed that [Di Renjie]'s soft wooden stick was hitting all the acupuncture points on his body.
0:19:29|0:19:42|At this moment, looking back at the skills [Di Renjie] practiced under the apricot tree, it was indeed a superior kung fu. Although the apricot leaves were intact, the meridians within were already severed. Beside him, Yi An and Zhou Jin also avoided the unknown liquid and escaped from the trap.
0:19:42|0:19:51|[Fei Yan] saw the three men joining forces, realizing she was no match for them. She then displayed her illusion technique by waving her sleeves in front of her, creating a misty and eerie atmosphere before disappearing from the sight of the crowd.
0:19:55|0:20:2|On a wooden frame, [Fei Yan] appeared, attracting everyone's attention. [Di Renjie] quickly climbed the beam to the top floor to search for her whereabouts.
0:20:13|0:20:37|The lantern spontaneously started spinning, and with a slight thought, it was clear that it was a trap. Hurriedly shouting, as [Di Renjie] had predicted, this place had been set up with a mechanism by [Fei Yan]. The large lantern was filled with an unknown liquid similar to the spherical hidden weapon, which was now spraying out, corroding everything in its path, creating a cloud of smoke.
0:20:48|0:21:2|Fei Yan made a desperate move, but still couldn't get rid of the vigilant Di Renjie. On the other side, Shui Yue finally made a discovery. In the hidden compartment of the box, the Imperial Dragon Scepter was quietly lying inside. Looking at the divine scepter, Shui Yue couldn't help but say to Gui Ye beside her,
0:21:4|0:21:12|Just as [Shui Yue] drew out the Dragon Spine Staff, she felt something was wrong as there were hidden lines connected to the staff.
0:21:18|0:21:37|Three pottery jars fell and shattered on the roof, alerting the guards. The Konglong Rod was also broken, revealing it to be a fake. Realizing they had been tricked, the two tried to escape but were trapped by a large net falling from above. [Di Renjie] had anticipated this, leaving them helpless in the net. After a short while, several police officers arrived with swords drawn, keeping watch outside the house.
0:21:37|0:21:58|In [Di Renjie]'s bedroom, thick smoke billowed out through the cracks of the doors and windows, but there was no fire, which was quite strange. Everyone rushed in, and inside the room, the thick smoke obscured their vision. Only when they approached did they discover a empty net on the ground, and the bound person was nowhere to be seen. The leading police officer slowly read aloud a note taken from the brocade bag.
0:23:24|0:23:37|The empress dowager flew into a rage and unintentionally revealed the secret of the Tang Dynasty, causing [Yuchi Zhenjin] to kneel in silence. In the Ministry of Justice, [Di Renjie] stayed up all night, seemingly troubled by inner demons, sitting at the table, reminiscing about the past.
0:23:53|0:24:9|This is the Sanzang Temple, where [Di Renjie] is extremely respectful, kneeling on the ground and reaching out to the monk. The monk uses his finger as a brush, writing and drawing on his palm. When the monk stops writing, [Di Renjie] slowly speaks,
0:24:49|0:25:3|Recalling the words of the apprentice [Yuan Ce], and thinking of the tragic death of the victim poisoned in Lengyuzhai today. [Di Renjie] suddenly felt a stagnation of true qi in his chest and abdomen, his blood boiling, unbearable pain. At this moment, there was a police officer knocking on the door outside.
0:25:10|0:25:29|The police officer heard a muffled groan from inside the room, fearing something was amiss, he broke in and couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, only to see [Di Renjie] fainted on the cushion. This police officer, known as [Shatuo], is a physician among them, who once worked with [Di Renjie] to solve the case of the Dragon King in the capital. Their relationship is close, hence he privately refers to him as Old Di. [Shatuo] came to visit late at night, though the reason was unknown.
0:25:29|0:25:36|When he fell ill, he was treated with acupuncture. Di Renjie woke up from time to time and helped him sit up. Shatuo Zhong spoke up and asked.
0:25:57|0:26:19|Just as the two were talking, [Wu Zetian] arrived at a secluded cave in the wilderness with [Yuchi Zhenjin] and a maid. The thunder roared and the rain poured down, as if there were demons. After [Wu Zetian] finished speaking, she turned and walked alone into the cave. As she walked away, the maid timidly asked, and [Yuchi Zhenjin] replied,
0:26:52|0:27:2|In no time, [Wu Zetian] had arrived in the prison cell and spoke to the underground,
0:27:10|0:27:17|Outside the cave, [Yuchi Zhenjin] pushed away the palace maid, and the faceless monkey in the dungeon spoke.
0:27:46|0:27:59|Listening to what [Wu Zetian] said, whether it is the current power struggle or recruiting outsiders to counter the Great Li Ministry, it is all part of this faceless monkey's scheme. [Yuchi Zhenjin] sneaked into the mansion and listened carefully to the movements inside.
0:28:20|0:28:29|Behind the cave wall, [Yuchi Zhenjin] heard the words of [Wu Zetian], his face extremely solemn, as if lost in thought.
0:28:38|0:28:49|Early the next morning, [Yuchi Zhenjin] led [Wu Zetian] to the Dali Temple to practice martial arts. They saw a four-foot bamboo pole erected on a flat ground, with a circular platform on top tied with a hemp rope.
0:28:49|0:29:4|With the fangs of the two towers on both sides, hanging in the middle of the furnace. At this moment, [Di Renjie] clings to the hemp rope and struggles upwards, with countless scorpions under his feet unable to bear the heat of the furnace following closely behind. All the police officers in the temple are chilled to the bone as they watch, giving a glimpse of [Di Renjie]'s martial arts skills.
0:29:4|0:29:20|Fortunately, with his strong martial arts skills, the poisonous scorpion never caught up with Di Renjie, only causing distress to Shatuo Zhong who was watching on the side. Such a unique way of training soldiers was unheard of, as he walked straight towards Yuchi Zhenjin and spoke.
0:30:0|0:30:27|At this moment, [Di Renjie] stood on the platform, but the bamboo pole was flexible and difficult to balance. When [Shatuo Zhong] shouted, [Di Renjie] couldn't stand steady and fell off the platform. The people below hurriedly reached out to catch him, and [Yuchi Zhenjin] also looked tense. He leaped down, only to see [Di Renjie] clamping the hemp rope with his legs in mid-air, then he flipped and swayed, landing on the ground unharmed.
0:30:46|0:30:57|Seeing [Shatuo Zhong] unharmed, [Di Renjie] turned around and said with a smile. Hearing this, [Yuchi Zhenjin] became thoughtful, his face tightened involuntarily, then followed [Di Renjie]’s footsteps. The two arrived at the bedroom, [Yuchi Zhenjin] slowed down, cautiously stepping inside.
0:30:59|0:31:10|Looking around, one could see traces of a large fire burning on the wooden floor, whether it was yet to be repaired or intentionally left that way. [Di Renjie] searched through the bookshelf and then spoke up.
0:33:5|0:33:11|[Di Renjie] spoke sincerely, then placed the scroll in front of him with both hands, gazing at it for a long time before continuing.
0:33:12|0:33:24|[Di Renjie] said this, causing a surge of emotions in the two of them, and they remained silent for a while. [Yuchi Zhenjin] raised the scroll with both hands and spoke.
0:33:27|0:33:45|The two met in a case to solve the mystery of the Dragon King in the capital. At that time, Yuchi Zhenjin was the Minister of the Dali Temple, but now he is the commander of the Imperial Guards. Things have changed, and Yuchi Zhenjin seems to have a lot to say but hesitates to reveal the Empress's plan.
0:33:45|0:33:52|In the end, with some hesitation, he turned and left. Outside the Dali Temple, [Shatuo Zhong] also had thoughts in his mind.
0:34:19|0:34:26|Just as he was worrying and pondering, the words of the vendor beside him caught his attention.
0:34:51|0:35:4|Upon hearing this, [Shatuo Zhong] immediately became alert. Concerned about the Empress, he entered the market and sat down at a vendor's stall, secretly observing [Shui Yue] hiding in the corner tower responsible for monitoring the Grand Court.
0:35:5|0:35:22|Her gaze fell upon a flag fluttering in the wind, with patterns depicting the faintly visible runes on the ground when she first arrived at the Dali Temple. The flag marked the gathering place of a group of sorcerers, all of whom concealed their true faces behind ghost masks, unlike the other sorcerers in the market.
0:35:22|0:35:49|[Shui Yue] carefully observed and saw [Shatuo Zhong] dressed in official attire sitting among them, staring straight at the eerie incantations and silently memorizing them in his heart. At this moment, a strange figure with a hawk mask was secretly peering, exchanging glances with the mysterious guest. The female Taoist performer in the scene immediately started dancing gracefully, spinning around with bells and ropes, her enchanting music piercing the ears. In just a moment, [Shatuo Zhong] was already feeling disoriented. Seeing this, the female performer approached him intimately, embracing him with a smile as gentle as peach blossoms.
0:35:50|0:36:10|At this critical moment, a person suddenly rushed out and stood in front of [Shatuo Zhong]. Without hesitation, a slap landed on his face. The pain broke the illusion, and the person explained before dragging the somewhat dazed [Shatuo Zhong] towards the market outside.
0:36:27|0:36:34|Seeing the two about to leave, [Shui Yue] quickly jumped down from the corner tower and rushed towards the disguised [Di Renjie].
0:36:42|0:36:54|Passing [Shatuo Zhong], [Di Renjie] turned and blended into the crowd in the market. [Shui Yue] arrived a step late and mistakenly took an old man for [Di Renjie]. After investigating and finding nothing, she left in frustration. She spoke fluent Fan language and turned out to be a Tiele tribe member.
0:36:56|0:37:15|Surveying the surroundings of the market, pedestrians coming and going, it was difficult to find any trace of [Di Renjie]. At this moment, [Shui Yue] suddenly felt several masked individuals lurking beside her, their intentions unknown, their origins and identities a mystery. Without engaging with them, she quickly withdrew and left, lifting the corner of the door curtain and rushing in.
0:37:15|0:37:25|The masked men followed closely behind, but [Shui Yue] was nowhere to be seen. They then arrived at a hidden tent, surrounded by eerie charms and spells hanging in the air. Inside the tent, a strange figure stood tall with a brazier placed in the center.
0:37:54|0:38:0|Di Renjie was hanging high above the dangerous building. By the next day, the empress's carriage had arrived outside the Dali Temple.
0:38:1|0:38:15|Upon seeing the Empress, the guard hurriedly reported the commotion outside. Upon hearing this, the Empress warned [Shatuo Zhong] to be on guard.
0:38:23|0:38:36|In the temple, after the police officers lined up to welcome, [Shatuo Zhong] hurriedly acted according to the plan. He searched in the medicine box for the note left by [Di Renjie], and only then did he know where he was hiding.
0:38:36|0:39:0|The empress's power is great, and her entourage is no less grand than that of [Tang Gao Zong]. She is accompanied by a canopy umbrella, eight banners, and attended to by palace maids for all her needs. Her safety is ensured by a team of Jinwu guards. Upon arriving at the temple, the main seat is prepared for her, and only then do the police officers stand up and line up to await orders. The empress speaks frankly, saying,
0:39:37|0:39:47|Upon hearing these words, a fleeting smile crossed the Empress's face, then she returned to calmness. She saw the officers in the temple cowering under her authority, not daring to speak, so she pretended to be angry and spoke.
0:40:5|0:40:15|The words caused a stir, and the guards in the temple looked at each other in confusion, not knowing what to do.
0:40:25|0:40:44|Although reluctant to make things difficult, the will of the Empress had to be followed. Thus, everyone was led to inspect the temple. As the crowd dispersed, [Shui Yue] closely watched [Shatuo Zhong] hastily leaving. He hurriedly made his way, encountering a monk along the path, without even bothering to return the greeting. Meanwhile, the Empress and her entourage inspected various areas, and then [Ba Dao] bowed and spoke.
0:40:53|0:41:0|Upon hearing this, the Empress turned to [Huan Tian] and ordered him to speak.
0:41:16|0:41:33|Just as [Bo Qianzhang] was mocking [Huan Tian], [Shatuo Zhong] arrived at the entrance of the bathroom. He hastily returned the gesture to the two conductors who bowed to him, then pushed aside the curtain and rushed into the bathroom. Walking into a compartment, he quickly loosened his clothes and hung them on a rack beside him, looking hurried and anxious.
0:41:33|0:41:49|Causing [Shui Yue] to be increasingly suspicious, suddenly [Shatuo Zhong] crouched down in the compartment. [Shui Yue] lost sight and quickly looked elsewhere. Looking around, she saw the corner tower towering beside her, with a broad view. So she leaped up and, as expected, set her eyes on this place, leaving no detail in the bathroom unnoticed.
0:41:49|0:42:3|Shui Yue leaned against the railing, looking into the compartment. Only to see a naked man standing up from a crouch, his back facing him. Without suspecting anything, Shui Yue thought Shatuo Zhong was still there, so he continued to monitor. This man is none other than Zhou Jin, a capable detective under Di Renjie's command.
0:42:3|0:42:27|Taking advantage of Shui Yue's momentary distraction, the two of them swiftly changed positions and enacted a scene of deception, successfully confusing her senses and escaping surveillance. Shatuo Zhong quickly put on some clothing and slipped out from a hidden compartment, cautiously ensuring that no one was following him. He made his way to the storage room, opened the door, and retrieved a note left by Di Renjie. By the candlelight, he carefully examined the note and compared the architectural structure with the items stored in the room.
0:42:27|0:42:52|He held up the note and kept muttering. After careful identification, he finally found a hidden door under the wooden ladder in the room. After confirming that there was no one around, [Shatuo Zhong] pushed open the door and entered the corridor. At the end, he saw a secret room, where a person was sitting on a cushion in front of the table. Hearing the noise behind him, [Di Renjie] suddenly turned into blue smoke.
0:44:50|0:45:13|Di Renjie pushed Shatuo Zhong away and headed outside. Meanwhile, Shui Yue, who was watching from the corner tower, finally realized that the person she was monitoring was not Shatuo Zhong. Without hesitation, she leaped down and rushed straight into the bathroom. Little did she know that as soon as she jumped in through the window, she came face to face with the naked Shatuo Zhong pushing open the compartment door.
0:45:27|0:45:36|Watching [Shui Yue] realizing her slip of the tongue, she didn't feel embarrassed at all. Bold and straightforward in her words and actions, she even made [Shatuo Zhong] blush.
0:46:9|0:46:18|The farce in the temple comes to an end, the scene shifts to the streets of Luoyang city during mealtime. [Yuchi Zhenjin] sits among the street vendors, lost in thought.
0:46:37|0:46:52|[Yuchi Zhenjin] slammed the table suddenly. Then, amidst the surprised gazes of many Jinwu Guards, he quickly left.
0:47:0|0:47:7|Yuchi Zhenjin had already arrived outside the Imperial Kitchen in the Temple of the Celestial King as he muttered to himself.
0:47:15|0:47:30|After some deduction, he was convinced that the Dragon Spine bestowed by the emperor must be hidden by [Di Renjie] on the statue of the Heavenly King. Anxious and disregarding taboos, he leaped onto the statue, and as expected, the Dragon Spine was indeed concealed between the chest armor and the palm of the Heavenly King.
0:47:30|0:47:40|Yuchi Zhenjin carefully took it out and held it in front of his eyes. The coldness of the Yun Tie weapon enveloped his mind, and he knew that the weapon in his hand was genuine.
0:48:0|0:48:10|Just as he was worrying about how to proceed in the future, suddenly the temple gate was broken, and a burly figure, carrying a pair of single-moon double knives, burst into the Temple of the Heavenly King. It was none other than the ghostly [Ba Dao].
0:48:26|0:48:46|They already had a mutual dislike for each other. Now, in this remote location, [Ba Dao] has come for the Kanglingjian, and a life-and-death struggle immediately unfolds. With a big knife at his feet, he takes off the ice blade on his back and throws it towards [Yuchi Zhenjin]. The ethereal single-edged blade changes in the air, splitting into three parts - one real and two illusions, confusing the senses, as the big knife chops down.
0:48:46|0:49:3|The king's head, [Yuchi Zhenjin] dodged and pulled out his long knife from his waist, leaping down to engage in close combat. After the fight, he was greatly surprised. This ghostly [Ba Dao] was not just a name, his double-bladed fan technique was superb, eerie and enchanting. His body was as solid as a rock, with boundless brute force, truly not easy to deal with.
0:49:3|0:49:20|In a moment of carelessness, [Ba Dao] lifted him up and slammed him heavily onto the beam. Yuchi Zhenjin was furious and flew up again to engage with him, but [Ba Dao]'s weapon was both offensive and defensive, making it difficult to shake. In the blink of an eye, he was forced back into the temple corridor.
0:49:20|0:49:37|[Ba Dao] is as fierce as a tiger, chasing closely without giving up. He steps on the Fan Yue double knives under his feet, using his internal energy to move forward, shattering the blue brick floor and splashing debris. [Yuchi Zhenjin] retreats while spinning his Tang knife in front of him, purely on the defensive. However, as time passes, [Yuchi Zhenjin] has no choice but to retreat further and can only leap onto the second floor to temporarily evade.
0:49:37|0:49:44|[Ba Dao] swung his blade into the air, once again forcing him in front of the Heavenly King. Before he could stand firm, the dual blades flew in, exuding boundless killing intent.
0:49:46|0:49:55|Yuchi Zhenjin could only block with his sword, but was fiercely lifted by the monstrous force and slammed into the statue of the Heavenly King. The second flying knife followed closely, and after barely dodging it, Yuchi Zhenjin lay on the ground unable to move.
0:49:55|0:50:17|The crescent moon blade spun in the air, cutting through the two heavenly kings' statues from their calves, causing them to fall. [Yuchi Zhenjin] was trapped inside, temporarily unable to break free. Seeing this, [Ba Dao] angrily shouted and brought down the full force of his blade. [Yuchi Zhenjin] had no way to dodge, instinctively protecting his head and using the strength of his back to withstand the blow. With a loud bang, a corner of the dark moon crescent blade broke off, but [Yuchi Zhenjin] was unharmed.
0:50:17|0:50:36|With the force of impact, he broke free. This time, it should be credited to Yuchi Zhenjin for protecting the Dragon Spine Staff on his back. At this moment, his eyes were shining, firmly holding the Dragon Spine Staff, directly clashing with Ba Dao's blade. As he leaped up, he happened to trigger the mechanism on the staff, causing the two blades to collide, the sound of the wind and sword resonating like a dragon's roar and a phoenix's cry.
0:50:38|0:50:52|Watching the Ghostly Moon Fan and the Twin Blades of the Moon being struck by the Dragon-Subduing Staff, in an instant, they cracked inch by inch. The shattered blade fragments flew like hidden arrows piercing through the body, splashing blood everywhere. [Ba Dao] was pierced from the chest to the back in countless places, and in just a few breaths, he turned into a lifeless body, devoid of any vitality.
0:50:52|0:51:7|Yuchi Zhenjin narrowly escaped danger and leaned against the statue of the Heavenly King. He raised the Dragon Spine Flail in front of him and examined it carefully, then couldn't help but show a smile of joy and burst into laughter.
0:51:8|0:51:18|The next day, as the sun rose, Yuchi Zhenjin headed towards the imperial palace to report for duty. Halfway there, his heart was in turmoil. At this moment, holding the Dragon Spine Staff in his hand, he couldn't help but recall what the Empress had once said.
0:51:38|0:52:3|Yuchi Zhenjin, who has been serving the Empress for a long time and knows her well, speculated that if Di Renjie lost the Kylin Rod, the Empress would use it as a reason to request severe punishment from Tang Gao Zong. The Empress's words of not harming Di Renjie and his family even a bit were hard to believe. With this in mind, Yuchi Zhenjin had no intention of handing over the Kylin Rod. He had already walked into the side hall, where a eunuch's voice made him regain his composure. Yuchi Zhenjin waited in the side hall.
0:53:15|0:53:24|Upon hearing the Empress's words, Yuchi Zhenjin knelt on the ground and was momentarily speechless, before replying. The scene then shifts to the Yiluan Hall.
0:53:47|0:53:58|[Tang Gao Zong] finished speaking and saw [Huan Tian] stand up, shaking off the dust to reveal his limbs, each arm holding something hard, performing a powerful move in the air. Yuchi Zhenjin looked down upon it, while the Empress Wu Zetian on the side laughed and clapped.
0:53:58|0:54:16|The courtiers all echoed one after another, but luckily [Tang Gao Zong] remained composed and was not very satisfied with this illusion. Looking at [Huan Tian], one hand held floating dust in front of his chest, while the other three arms pointed towards the sky, and three dark clouds appeared out of thin air. The dark clouds were controlled in the palm of his hand, following his every move. Then, the four arms rotated, the dark clouds rose into the sky, floating above the grand hall with a momentum that covered the sky.
0:54:18|0:54:32|At this moment, [Gui Ye] spoke up, and with a sudden movement of his back, he revealed the hidden mechanism. He shot out dozens of pellets into the dark clouds, causing thunder to roar.
0:54:38|0:55:5|The empress seemed convinced and paid no attention to what [Tang Gao Zong] said. She clapped her hands absentmindedly, while [Huan Tian] gently blew on the flute placed near his mouth, the lingering sound like water wrapping around the dragon pillars in the hall, never-ending. Then, under the dark clouds, lightning and thunder struck, a sudden storm brewing. Among the officials, some curious ones reached out, feeling the rain, surprised,
0:55:24|0:55:32|Seeing this, [Huan Tian] made [Fei Yan] grab an object from a distance and said,
0:55:57|0:56:14|After being appreciated by [Wu Zetian], the extraordinary group couldn't contain their joy. Just then, dark clouds reappeared more intensely than before, with thunder and lightning striking as a giant python writhed in the clouds. From the palace to the court, neither the two saints nor the officials could understand what was happening.
0:56:23|0:56:34|Just as [Gui Ye] was talking to [Huan Tian], dark clouds rolled over the palace, and the golden dragon on the pillar emitted a low roar, its eyes shining brightly, its armor glowing, coming to life.
0:56:36|0:57:0|The court officials in the palace exclaimed in surprise, the Jinwu Guards drew their swords and stood on guard. They saw the originally pure gold Nine-Clawed Celestial Dragon perched on the beams and pillars, twisting in mid-air. In the blink of an eye, it no longer had the stiffness of gold and stone, with eyes like bells, horns like dew-covered cattle, a mouth like a camel's head, fish scales and a snake body. It loomed large in the palace, its hair moving without wind, flying with few wings, its gaze like lightning, exuding a powerful aura that disturbed people's minds, and its voice like thunder.
0:57:0|0:57:7|With the commanding power and prestige, Di Renjie and his group saw the people in front of them in a panic, crouching on the ground and whispering to each other.
0:57:18|0:57:30|At this moment, a golden dragon emerged from the clouds with a low roar, mocking the people in the hall. Suddenly, a torrential rain poured down, but the clothes remained dry. [Tang Gao Zong] forced a calm demeanor, stood up, and burst into laughter.
0:57:37|0:58:0|The courtiers clapped their hands in agreement, but there was still a hint of fear in their eyes. The golden dragon turned to face the group of strangers, its eyes sharp and proud, then opened its huge mouth with dragon teeth visible. Flames spewed out from its throat, piercing through the court and reaching several yards outside the main hall, lasting for a long time. The golden dragon stood in the air, and where its gaze fell was exactly where [Gui Ye] was.
0:58:4|0:58:13|A burst of flames shot out from the dragon's mouth again, causing [Gui Ye] to scream in agony. Thick smoke billowed in the court, and both civil and military officials, even the Emperor and Empress, changed color at the scene.
0:58:15|0:58:36|[Yuchi Zhenjin] commanded the guards around him, paying no attention to anything else. After dealing with [Gui Ye], he then headed towards [Fei Yan]. Startled, [Fei Yan] mistakenly thought the golden dragon was attracted to the pearl in his hand. He shouted in panic, then threw the pearl aside, quickly got up, raised his sleeve robe in front of his eyes, and used magic to escape.
0:58:36|0:58:45|Who knew that the golden dragon's eyes were sharp, able to see through all illusions, and found the true identity of [Fei Yan] from the thick fog, swallowing it in one gulp, causing the maidservants to scream in shock.
0:58:45|0:58:56|[Yuchi Zhenjin] leads the attendants to guard the two saints closely, while the golden dragon soars into the sky in the hall, standing upright for several meters, like a pillar reaching the heavens, shattering the dome and flying.
0:58:56|0:59:7|Rising and leaving behind a mess, the people in the hall were still in shock. [Yuchi Zhenjin] was the first to come to his senses, looking around to see that [Huan Tian] was nowhere to be found, leaving behind only a pair of mechanical arms.
0:59:16|0:59:26|Yuchi Zhenjin finished speaking and dashed towards the palace gates. Having already arranged for guards, he led the troops into the palace, seeking reinforcements along the way.
0:59:28|0:59:45|[Yuchi Zhenjin] disregarded the palace rules, leaped over roofs and walls, and rushed to the noisy place. He stood in front of the assailant with his sword, only to see that the person was wearing the flowing meteor and qilin armor with a double dragon turtle cloak on his back, which was exactly his own appearance, but with extremely strange features.
0:59:45|0:59:52|[Yuchi Zhenjin] couldn't hide his shock, he was momentarily distracted by the person escaping over the wall, just as he was about to track him down,
1:0:2|1:0:8|Unable to argue back, [Yuchi Zhenjin] could only throw down his weapon in anger.
1:0:31|1:0:39|[Tang Gao Zong] was furious after hearing the thunderous news, and immediately ordered someone to rush to the Dali Temple.
1:1:37|1:1:43|Zhou Jin, Yi An, and another person rode their horses out of the Dali Temple, raising dust as they galloped non-stop towards the outskirts of the city.
1:1:51|1:2:11|On the corner tower, [Shui Yue] spotted the masked sorcerer reappearing, closely following three police officers, so she rode her horse to chase after Zhou Jin and others. Zhou Jin sensed something was amiss, and as they reached the city, they split into three groups, scattering to lure the enemy. The market outside the city was intricate and complex, with more than one force monitoring the Great Liang Temple. Amidst the chaos of arrows flying, with a mix of truth and falsehood, just one step further from Zhou Jin successfully drew the attention of both sides.
1:2:11|1:2:17|[Di Renjie] is truly capable, worthy of the reputation of the Southeast's lost treasures and pearls in the sea.
1:2:34|1:2:57|When the three groups from the Dali Temple were each going their separate ways, [Shui Yue] chased the masked sorcerer into the streets, turning into an alley. Suddenly stopping her horse, [Shui Yue] looked ahead where the road was shrouded in mist, obstructed by someone's mischief. Disdainful, [Shui Yue] urged her horse forward and shouted loudly.
1:3:13|1:3:38|The two sides started fighting as soon as they exchanged words. [Shui Yue] rode towards three black-robed masked figures. The three men pulled a steel wire from behind, connected to a hollow silver ball with eyeballs drawn on it around their waists. Then there was a sound of breaking, covering the streets and alleys. The three black-clothed men leaped into the air on horseback, their limbs turning into long dry wood, each with a sharp blade at the top, walking in the air and heading straight for [Shui Yue].
1:3:38|1:4:4|[Shui Yue] threw out flying knives to test, all of which were deflected by the three men with their weapons. In great shock, she saw the three men merge into one, wearing a black robe and transforming into a six-armed monster. [Shui Yue] released her cloak to obstruct their view, then rushed towards the monster, using a dagger to cut open its ghostly face. To her surprise, the face that emerged from the darkness was that of the current empress, Wu Zetian. Momentarily distracted, she was stabbed in the side by the monster.
1:4:4|1:4:12|[Shui Yue] hurriedly evaded, relying on unparalleled light skills to contend with it, but suffered heavy injuries, and was ultimately forced by the monster to the rooftop.
1:4:12|1:4:33|[Shui Yue] hurriedly dodged and was struck in the left shoulder again. She asked angrily, taking advantage of the monster's momentary relaxation of vigilance, [Shui Yue] used illusion techniques to escape from underneath it. With multiple wounds and blood gushing like a spring, during the ordeal, [Shui Yue] shattered debris fell from the roof, stirring up a cloud of dust.
1:4:39|1:5:9|Ignoring the eerie sounds of the monsters, [Shui Yue] put the whistle in her mouth and blew it. Nearby, her steed heard the whistle and galloped towards her. [Shui Yue] ran in a panic, but the monsters dispelled the illusion from the sky to the ground, revealing themselves as three black-robed figures continuing the chase. Just as the three were about a yard away from [Shui Yue], a steed burst through the wall, blocking the black-robed figures and preventing them from advancing. This unexpected turmoil and mysterious clouds were dispersed by the divine steed, protecting its master from afar. Taking advantage of the moment when the three figures retreated,
1:5:9|1:5:25|[Shui Yue] once again leaped onto the roof and plunged into the water pool. Ignoring the pain from her wounds, she quickly got up and walked along the wall. Blending into the crowd at the dye house, [Shui Yue] no longer displayed her usual elegance. In the past, when she competed with [Yuchi Zhenjin] in the imperial city, even if she lost a move, she remained unfazed.
1:5:25|1:5:37|Struggling against the black-robed figure, now reduced to this state, it is evident how terrifying the masked sorcerer is, [Shui Yue] staggers to the side of a stable. Covered in blood, unable to move forward, she collapses to the ground, completely powerless.
1:5:37|1:5:51|[Shui Yue] stood by, while [Shatuo Zhong], who had just changed his horse, looked slightly surprised at the scene. On the other side, as the black-robed figure regrouped and chased after them again, the dye house was bustling with activity, drawing the attention of passersby with the strange attire of the three individuals.
1:5:51|1:6:13|Three of them quietly displayed their illusions, and the passersby were drawn in. The ghostly faces of the three were like bottomless black holes, with dark light flowing. As the illusion took shape, everyone present was under their spell, gathering slowly and looking up at the sky. Following their gaze, they saw a flying celestial maiden dancing in the air, the sky clear and pure, the fairy graceful and scantily clad.
1:6:13|1:6:32|With fragrant shoulders and dewy lips exposed, dancing with the gentle breeze in a long dress, she seems to be ethereal and independent, smiling like a galaxy. The black-robed figure displayed illusion techniques, instantly causing dozens of people to fall into the same illusion, a formidable power. After dealing with the obstructive passersby, the three split up to search for the whereabouts of [Shui Yue].
1:6:32|1:7:0|At the same time, [Shatuo Zhong], who has an inexplicable fondness for [Shui Yue], has dragged her into the stable. He intended to hide her under the table, but to his surprise, the confused [Shui Yue] kicked away the stool supporting the wooden board, causing boots, saddles, armor, and other items to collapse. [Shatuo Zhong] had to use his body as a pillar to support it, and only heard [Shui Yue] mumbling with her mouth open,
1:7:8|1:7:28|The two realized they were from the same hometown only after speaking in Tiele, as the figure in black approached. [Shui Yue] called out to [Shatuo Zhong] to keep quiet, and the two had no choice but to remove their armor to conceal their tracks. The nearby figures in black moved away slightly, and just as [Shatuo Zhong] was about to speak, he was stopped by [Shui Yue] with a soft warning to keep quiet. It was this extremely subtle sound that caught the attention of the figures in black, and their gaze immediately turned towards the stables.
1:7:28|1:7:36|Under the heavy pressure, [Shatuo Zhong] could hardly hold on and quickly asked a question as the person passed by without further investigation and then left without any sign of disturbance.
1:7:37|1:7:45|[Shui Yue] remained silent, raising the sword towards his neck. Before [Shatuo Zhong] could react, a gush of blood spurted from his mouth, and he immediately fainted.
1:7:45|1:7:57|The scene shifts to the sorcerer's camp, where a figure in black robes reports to their clan leader about the disappearance of [Shui Yue]. Another clan member respectfully suggests that the Great Li Ministry has split into three groups to seek reinforcements.
1:8:41|1:8:47|The Wind Demon tribe members raised their arms and shouted in response.
1:8:47|1:9:12|In the midst of the passionate emotions in the tent, while inside the guest room, [Shui Yue], draped in a green veil, was in a moment of fragrant warmth. She was sweating profusely and regained consciousness from fainting, only to see [Shatuo Zhong] with a flushed face, making some movements in front of her. She immediately became alert, regained her senses, tightened the light veil on her body, reached behind herself, and heard [Shatuo Zhong] speak.
1:9:38|1:9:51|Seeing the person in front of her pouting with a light and airy look, [Shui Yue] disregarded the intense pain in her body, dragging the dagger and swinging it towards [Shatuo Zhong]. At this moment, she was extremely weak, with most of her strength dissipated. [Shatuo Zhong] easily dodged and explained,
1:10:6|1:10:24|As soon as the words fell, there was a movement by the bed. Turning back, [Shui Yue] was seen lying on the ground unable to move.
1:10:33|1:10:47|[Shui Yue], who has been in the martial arts world for a long time, is very alert. [Shatuo Zhong] doesn't care and takes a sip himself, then brings the pill to his lips. After a moment of hesitation, [Shui Yue] drinks a sip of the medicine, immediately frowning and her face changing drastically.
1:11:24|1:11:38|[Shui Yue] leaned against the bed and looked out the window, as if seeing wild chrysanthemums blooming on her homeland. The morning sun outlined the mountains and hills, with flocks of swallows flying by, prompting her to sigh suddenly.
1:11:39|1:11:47|[Shatuo Zhong] felt something in his heart, but found it hard to express. After a moment of silence, he finally spoke,
1:11:54|1:12:2|After calming his emotions, he refilled a bowl of herbal juice, holding the hot bottom of the bowl with a handkerchief, and approached [Shui Yue] again, whispering gently.
1:12:10|1:12:17|With gentle words, [Shui Yue] listened quietly as [Shatuo Zhong] finished speaking, placed the freshly brewed medicine by the bed, tidied up her belongings, and hurriedly said.
1:12:20|1:12:34|Watching the man about to leave in front of her, [Shui Yue] suddenly felt a strong reluctance in her heart, with a hint of panic in her eyes. Finally, she spoke up and asked. [Shatuo Zhong], who had already left the guest room, poked his head out and told [Shui Yue].
1:12:35|1:12:53|When only [Shui Yue] was left in the room, she felt the pent-up anger in her chest for many years surging and boiling at this moment. The attentive care of [Shatuo Zhong] allowed her to let down her guard for the first time in her life. As those hardened defenses fell away, she realized that [Shui Yue] was nothing more than a lovely and charming young lady in her prime.
1:12:53|1:13:4|She drank the medicine in the bowl in one gulp, the salty bitterness penetrating her throat, going straight to her heart and lungs, mixing with the just budding sweetness, her facial expressions all turning into a bitter smile, unable to let go.
1:13:4|1:13:30|[Shatuo Zhong] rode his horse, smiling on the horseback, reminiscing the tender moments just now, feeling the lingering smoothness of [Shui Yue]'s skin on his fingertips. During their intimate conversation in the guest room, [Shatuo Zhong] once asked why [Shui Yue] hid her true face behind heavy makeup. [Shui Yue] sadly replied that she didn't want to reveal her true appearance to others. After hearing this, [Shatuo Zhong] took a handkerchief and gently wiped off the makeup on her forehead, while [Shui Yue] looked at him with affection in her eyes, not resisting.
1:13:30|1:13:36|At the height of their emotions, [Shatuo Zhong] spoke. [Shui Yue] then smiled gently.
1:13:54|1:14:14|In the most tender part of [Shui Yue]'s heart, it feels like a refreshing rain. After years of wandering the rivers and lakes with bitterness and hardships, tears of relief flow down her cheeks, the taste of being understood and cared for is wonderful. At the same time, outside the palace city of Dali Temple, the disguised [Di Renjie] has already walked beyond the palace walls, on duty to intercept and verify the identities of three individuals.
1:14:24|1:14:31|Several people then arrived outside the Yiluan Hall, only to find it empty. The ground was covered with broken stones and debris, with imperial guards standing guard around.
1:17:2|1:17:18|Huo Geng turned around in shock, then led the two to the Taiyu prison. Taiyu prison was a subordinate institution of the highest supervisory agency of the Tang Dynasty, the Imperial Censorate, responsible for detaining corrupt officials. Yuchi Zhenjin, who was being held there, was equivalent to today's disciplinary commission. As soon as they entered the prison, they heard Yuchi Zhenjin cursing loudly.
1:19:50|1:19:56|Huo Geng was stunned after hearing this, he turned to look at [Di Renjie]. Before he could say anything, Yuchi Zhenjin's eyes widened in anger, pointing a finger and roaring loudly.
1:20:0|1:20:7|Huo Geng, feeling helpless, gave a deep look at his dismissed superior and gestured to him.
1:20:36|1:21:9|During the conversation, several people squatted down together to investigate the bottom of the carriage. [Di Renjie] used a piece of soft wood in his hand to tap the carriage frame, distinguishing the mystery by listening to the sound. [Ding Xun] took off his gloves from his waist and handed them over, being prepared. Then, the group leaned into the bottom of the carriage, removed the hidden objects, dragged them to a spacious area next to the carriage, and lit a lamp to observe. Only then did they realize that the object was a huge bundle of cloth.
1:21:9|1:21:22|[Di Renjie], with his hands wrapped in cloth strips, crouched down on the ground and untied the cloth bundle. Inside, there lay a male corpse, with a withered appearance, tongue hanging out, and eyes closed. After the onlookers gathered around and identified the body, they exclaimed in shock, saying,
1:21:54|1:22:4|[Ding Xun]'s words hit the crux of the case. After a moment of thought, [Di Renjie] continued.
1:22:14|1:22:39|Hearing what [Yuchi Zhenjin] said, [Di Renjie] slightly turned his head to indicate the crowded surroundings. Understanding, [Yuchi Zhenjin] waved his hand, prompting [Huo Geng] to reluctantly shout for everyone to move away. Once the people around had moved several yards away, [Di Renjie] called [Yuchi Zhenjin] over to the side. The two stood facing each other, and [Di Renjie] lowered his voice and slowly said, pausing for a moment,
1:22:48|1:23:3|[Yuchi Zhenjin] suddenly realized and asked, hitting [Di Renjie] right on the sore spot, causing him to feel a sharp pain in his chest at that moment.
1:23:7|1:23:16|At the same time, Empress Wu Zetian, accompanied by her maid, marched aggressively towards the desolate mountain cave, breaking through the prison gate blocking the way, and roared angrily,
1:23:34|1:23:45|After that, the faceless monkey imprisoned in the underground water dungeon broke free from the shackles and rushed towards [Wu Zetian], grabbing her throat and shouting.
1:23:47|1:23:58|[Wu Zetian], in order to deceive others, entered and exited the death prison alone without any attendants, unexpectedly finding herself in a dangerous situation. Just then, a person outside the cave shouted.
1:24:49|1:24:57|Empress Wu Zetian regained consciousness and saw Emperor Tang Gao Zong. She then saw Yuchi Zhenjin and Di Renjie by his side.
1:25:18|1:25:37|On the other side, outside the Sanchang Temple, a man rode up on horseback, it was [Shatuo Zhong]. By now it was already night, the trees outside the temple were dense, with the sound of insects chirping, thin mist rising from the roots of the short trees, numerous strange rocks inside the temple, with only half a candle lit, the moonlight clear, scattered all over the ground. [Shatuo Zhong] entered, bowed to a monk in a robe and spoke,
1:25:46|1:25:56|Finishing speaking, [Di Renjie] pulled out the bamboo slip entrusted to him from his sleeve and handed it to the monk in front of him. After inspecting it, the monk said to him,
1:26:2|1:26:9|The monk stepped into the stone forest, ignoring the chatter behind him. [Shatuo Zhong] felt bored and had to hurry to catch up.
1:26:9|1:26:27|Approaching a giant banyan tree, the monk stopped in his tracks, gesturing to [Shatuo Zhong] before bowing and departing. [Shatuo Zhong] sobbed, watching as the monk walked away with a flick of his sleeve. Looking around, [Shatuo Zhong] was drawn to the countless pillars built from stone blocks beside him.
1:26:27|1:26:50|He took down a piece to examine it, but unexpectedly the entire stone pillar collapsed with a bang. [Shatuo Zhong] was greatly shocked and quickly looked around, only to see a figure hidden in the banyan tree. The person was sitting cross-legged in the tree hole for an unknown period of time, with short grass growing on his knees, dry vines covering his body, and a dim cold light shining on him. The only thing shining brightly was the rosary on his chest.
1:26:50|1:27:7|It is the disciple of the Tripitaka master, [Yuan Ce]. [Shatuo Zhong] stepped forward to speak, but remembered the paper with the symbol of the Wind Demon Clan entrusted by the monk in front of the temple. He took it out from his bosom and showed it to [Yuan Ce], who closed his eyes and remained unmoved. [Shatuo Zhong] had to gently blow on his face in an attempt to awaken him.
1:27:7|1:27:19|At this moment, a loud roar was heard from above, and [Shatuo Zhong] looked up to see a giant ape descending from the sky. He quickly dodged to avoid it. The giant ape stood between the banyan tree and [Shatuo Zhong], separating the two.
1:27:19|1:27:34|The massive figure, towering over [Shatuo Zhong], appeared like an ant from above. The giant ape, possessing spiritual powers, raised a huge finger to touch [Shatuo Zhong]'s face, indicating him to speak less. Understanding the signal, [Shatuo Zhong] quickly raised the talisman in his hand. The giant ape glanced sideways to observe, then turned to look at [Shatuo Zhong].
1:27:34|1:27:50|Xiao Zhi understood the intention, the giant ape exhaled hot air from its nose, then entered the temple. The space twisted, fireflies fluttered in an instant, fairy mist lingered, and the plants and trees were all shining with spiritual energy. At this moment, the giant ape disappeared, and a faint voice came.
1:28:5|1:28:18|At the sound of the call, a huge koi carp emerged from the vegetation, floating in the air, surrounded by a circle around [Shatuo Zhong]. The trees were in the sky, the clouds were on the ground, and the universe turned upside down.
1:29:10|1:29:23|The Golden Carp transformed into [Yuan Ce], and after speaking, swished its tail and disappeared into the thick fog. When [Shatuo Zhong] came to his senses, he found himself on the back of a giant ape, climbing through the treetops. The giant ape carried him to [Yuan Ce]'s secluded place of cultivation, outside the Sanzang Temple.
1:29:23|1:29:39|[Shatuo Zhong] fell to the ground, unharmed. The experience left him dizzy and incredulous. As he got up, a giant ape threw a sachet at him, then shook its massive head and flew away, leaving [Shatuo Zhong] standing there at a loss.
1:29:39|1:29:56|Early the next morning in the outskirts of Luoyang City, a simple carriage entered through the main gate of the Dali Temple without any hindrance. The person driving the carriage was none other than [Di Renjie]. The Assistant Minister [Bao Qianzhang], who was left in charge, came with his men to greet the inspection. As soon as the patrol officer opened his mouth to ask a question.
1:30:8|1:30:22|After saying that, [Bo Qianzhang] led the men and women in the carriage to walk deep into the Dali Temple. From the caution of [Di Renjie] to the respect of [Bo Qianzhang], it is expected that these two individuals should be the two saints of the current dynasty, [Tang Gao Zong] and [Wu Zetian].
1:30:32|1:30:38|[Di Renjie] hurriedly stopped him, whispered a warning, and then asked.
1:30:55|1:31:11|At this moment, [Shatuo Zhong] noticed the needle holes on his fingers and asked. Then the scene shifted to the bedroom of [Di Renjie], where [Shatuo Zhong] continued to perform acupuncture to stabilize his condition.
1:31:33|1:31:59|The conversation once again stirred up the heartache of [Di Renjie], the words of the Master Sanzang and [Yuan Ce] from years ago lingered in his mind. [Di Renjie] kept repeating [Yuan Ce]'s words, suddenly placing his right palm on the candle flame to train, enduring the intense pain to sharpen his mind, contemplating [Yuan Ce]'s words. [Shatuo Zhong] was greatly surprised, not daring to interrupt, fearing to disrupt his thoughts and undo all the previous efforts. When some insights were gained, [Di Renjie] was physically and mentally exhausted, fainting away.
1:32:12|1:32:18|They quickly assembled to execute the backup plan, with another group of people bowing respectfully.
1:33:1|1:33:10|At this point, [Gui Ye] and the clan leader chuckled, and after much consideration, the clan leader spoke, instructing [Gui Ye] to sneak into the Dali Temple at night to investigate the whereabouts of the Empress.
1:33:25|1:33:41|With his words, a clan member presented a tray with a black cloth to the clan leader. Upon lifting the cloth, a magical weapon was revealed. The clan leader spoke with a sharp tone. The camera then shifted to Di Renjie, who woke up.
1:33:46|1:33:54|Ignoring what [Shatuo Zhong] said, [Di Renjie] forced himself to sit up, leaning against the bed rail, panting for a while before speaking seriously,
1:34:55|1:35:13|[Di Renjie] paused his actions and looked at [Shatuo Zhong] with a hint of confusion. [Shatuo Zhong] smiled ambiguously, his gaze slightly evasive, before nodding slightly. Furrowing his brow, [Di Renjie] expressed his concern, and the scene shifted to the temporary residence of [Shui Yue] in the pharmacy.
1:35:34|1:35:41|[Shatuo Zhong] dared not act rashly, closed his eyes and waited. [Shui Yue] said he was ignorant, so she used her hands to open his eyes.
1:35:48|1:36:1|Following the sound of the conversation, [Shui Yue] saw Yi An and Zhou Jin leading three people into the pharmacy to investigate. Puzzled, she stood in front of [Shatuo Zhong] with a hint of dissatisfaction and asked.
1:36:3|1:36:18|Upon hearing this, [Shui Yue]'s face paled, as if a mist was condensing in her eyes. Yuchi Zhenjin and the others shook their heads to indicate that they had not found any evidence. So the officers stepped forward, bound [Shui Yue]'s hands with a rope, and prepared to take her away for questioning.
1:36:41|1:36:44|The two looked at each other for a long time, and then the police escorted [Shui Yue] out of the house.
1:37:4|1:37:22|After that, [Di Renjie] led all the monks to bow and ask for advice. [Shui Yue], who had long lived in the martial arts world, only knew that people's hearts were not ancient, full of deceit. She had never received such trust before. Moreover, she had just thought that she and [Shatuo Zhong] had a falling out, but now the situation had changed. [Shui Yue] couldn't help but feel unsettled and restless.
1:37:22|1:37:38|Turning to [Shatuo Zhong], only to see his tears staining his clothes, it was clear that what [Di Renjie] said was not false. [Shui Yue] had a strong personality, so she rushed forward and directly knocked [Shatuo Zhong] to the ground, straddling him and punching and kicking him.
1:37:39|1:37:49|The incident came to an end, and the scene shifted to the back door of the Dali Temple. [Shatuo Zhong] rode out with a battered head, while [Shui Yue] used illusion to conceal herself behind him.
1:37:49|1:38:1|Walking through the market in Fangshi, [Shatuo Zhong] paused in a bustling area for a moment. [Shui Yue] then dispelled the illusion and crossed over the wall, disappearing. [Shatuo Zhong] stopped his horse abruptly and gazed into the distance, silently reciting to himself.
1:38:21|1:38:53|[Shatuo Zhong] couldn't help but ask [Di Renjie], sensing that war was imminent. [Di Renjie] inspected the temple guards, deployed defensive formations, and after all the arrangements were made, it was already late at night. At this moment, in the bedroom, he carefully examined the Konglong Staff, recalling how [Yuchi Zhenjin] held the Konglong Staff horizontally in front of him, and with one hand rotated the staff to generate force before striking a stone pillar behind him. The stone pillar cracked inch by inch.
1:38:53|1:39:7|Transformed into a lump of bran, [Di Renjie] pondered deeply, his brows furrowed. The gift bestowed by [Tang Gao Zong] could not be dealt with using common sense. What purpose does the Dragon Spine Staff serve? It remains to be discovered. The burden placed upon [Tang Gao Zong] is truly heavy.
1:39:7|1:39:28|At this moment, Di Renjie heard footsteps outside the door. He turned around and saw the person speaking was none other than the current Empress, Wu Zetian, who entered with a pair of prison guards.
1:40:22|1:40:32|The empress turned over on the bed of [Di Renjie].
1:40:51|1:41:0|The moment these words were spoken, the Empress's gaze fell upon the Dragon Spine, unable to look away.
1:41:20|1:41:44|After speaking, [Di Renjie] wielded his sword and struck the Empress's arm. Suddenly, the Empress had a Bilian iron snow blade in her hand, waving it continuously towards him. [Di Renjie] dodged and then used his staff to strike the snow blade. The illusion shattered with a sound, and the Empress transformed into a strange and eerie figure, laughing sinisterly. In her hand was the Bilian iron snow blade that could shatter gold and stone.
1:41:44|1:41:53|The Dragon Spine Staff has been broken by a single strike.
1:42:10|1:42:19|After saying that, [Gui Ye] was engulfed in raging flames, declaring the destruction of the Tang Dynasty, and burst out of the door. Fortunately, [Di Renjie] pushed aside the night patrol guards, so everyone was unharmed. However, the dormitory where [Gui Ye] resided was consumed by the flames.
1:42:19|1:42:26|Suddenly, thick smoke billowed, and the fire raged. Taking advantage of the chaos, [Gui Ye] transformed into a fireball and flew away.
1:42:43|1:42:52|The scene shifts to outside the Sanzang Temple, where the stone forest is in ruins, as if it has been affected by the flames of war.
1:43:12|1:43:21|At this highly tense moment, a cough was heard from behind. [Shui Yue] wielded two curved knives and stood ready, the scene faded away with the outcome unknown. The next morning,
1:43:43|1:44:5|On this day, the outskirts of the city were shrouded in thick fog, making it impossible to see beyond ten steps, with the officials in the Grand Court holding crossbows and wearing long knives, stationed throughout the mansion, ready for any situation. Outside the Grand Court, [Huo Geng] was ordered to lead countless palace guards, secretly lurking and waiting for the enemy to attack. At this moment, a strange low growl was heard from the Qiantang River, and the guards on the Sword Tower were on high alert.
1:44:6|1:44:40|The undercover police officer in Qiantang entered the square, looked up, and saw a hundred-foot tall angry statue standing there, made of crystal-like material with countless bloodshot eyes growing all over it, terrifying. The statue grabbed one of the police officers and the others followed to the mechanism inside the temple, breaking it open with force. Suddenly, a large net hidden inside dropped down, firmly locking the arm with blood-red pupils. The statue fell for the trap, revealing its iron face and sharp teeth.
1:44:40|1:44:49|The person locked in his gaze, everyone felt a chill down their spine, as if the bloodshot eyes had a strange effect on the mind. [Di Renjie] arrived upon hearing the news and spoke.
1:45:1|1:45:18|Taking the hand-copied scripture given by the police officer beside him, feeling grateful, reciting the scriptures together, the mind calm and composed, as if a heavenly net had enveloped the demon within, with a little effort, it turned into ashes and disappeared without a trace.
1:45:27|1:45:40|Just as the crowd was rescuing their companion in the square, they heard a scream from the archers ambushed on the roof, falling down the building. Then they saw numerous figures in black robes, wearing ghost masks, holding curved knives in their right hands, and flying towards them with small diamond shields in their left hands.
1:45:46|1:46:16|Inside the temple, the guards were on high alert. They saw a figure in black robes flying over the main gate with a long pole, leaping onto the high wall and engaging in a fierce battle with the guards inside. The large number of attackers caught the wall guards off guard. The first line of defense was breached, and the black-robed figures, with their unpredictable movements, circled around to the end of the defense line. They systematically cleared the archers positioned on the rooftops, who either met a gruesome end on the tiles or fell into the square below. The Wind Demon clan had surrounded the people of the Dali Temple from all sides, moving swiftly like the wind, forcing them to retreat. However, the battle had only just begun.
1:46:16|1:46:24|A large number of enemies surged in from all sides. In the midst of close combat, many of the mounted police were killed or injured, revealing the terror of the Wind Demon clan.
1:46:32|1:46:56|[Di Renjie] gave a command, and the police officer in the watchtower was about to ring the bronze bell, but was stopped by a figure in black. [Shatuo Zhong] protected his companion to retreat to the main hall, while he rushed towards the watchtower. Inside the arrow tower, [Ding Xun] hurriedly faced the enemy, shouting to [Di Renjie] below. Then he threw a hemp rope down, [Di Renjie] understood and climbed up with a slight run, lightly swinging up the beam.
1:46:56|1:47:9|With the help of this force, he hung on the eaves of the side hall and flipped onto the roof. At the same time, [Shatuo Zhong] rushed to the bronze bell under the corner tower, about to strike it, but saw a figure in black robes coming at him with a horizontal sword. [Shatuo Zhong] was caught off guard and stood frozen in place.
1:47:12|1:47:36|Fortunately, [Di Renjie] arrived in time and quickly ended the enemies with a hand crossbow. Outside the temple, [Huo Geng] heard the bell and shouted. Immediately, numerous Jinwu guards ambushed in the market, holding knives and riding horses towards the main gate of the Dali Temple. A small number of soldiers were left to look after the common people and merchants, while on the other side, the leader of the Fengmo tribe finally appeared on the roof, accompanied by [Gui Ye] and the cloaked figures.
1:47:36|1:47:53|Outside the temple, the Jinwu guards are approaching. The leader of the Fengmo tribe shakes the magic wheel in his hand, causing the silver hollow ball hanging around the waist of the tribe members to sway. Suddenly, the demonic sound fills the air, enveloping everyone in the illusion without their awareness. At this moment, a commotion is heard coming from outside the main gate.
1:47:53|1:48:3|The temple guard quickly turned his crossbow towards the front, as under the illusion, the arriving Jinwuwei transformed into a huge monster, shining with blood all over, headless and bodyless like a meatball.
1:48:8|1:48:22|Seeing those tentacles rushing towards them, everyone panicked. The Heart Spell was ineffective, so they had no choice but to shoot a barrage of arrows at the monster. Little did they know, in the eyes of the Golden Guards, it was also an illusion at this moment. The arrows flying in the air turned into tentacles and headed straight for everyone's faces.
1:48:24|1:48:41|[Huo Geng], fearless of death, led his men to dodge the flying arrows in the air, galloping wildly on horseback. In a moment, he clashed with the temple guards inside the temple, limbs entangled in illusions. [Di Renjie] and [Shatuo Zhong] rushed to Qiantang and witnessed the chaos in the scene, so they anxiously spoke out.
1:48:53|1:49:0|[Di Renjie] lightly tapped the ground, standing between the Chengjing and Jinwuwei, raising the Dragon Spine Staff high, rotating the mechanism, and shouted loudly.
1:49:1|1:49:16|Suddenly, the tentacles that were swirling like a group of demons dissipated in the wind, and both sides quickly regained their senses. [Huo Geng] quickly reacted in confusion and commanded the people behind him.
1:49:24|1:49:50|[Di Renjie] looked towards the backyard and saw thick smoke billowing from the warehouse. Just as he ordered [Bao Qianzhang] to rush back for support, the Wind Demon chieftain and [Gui Ye] sensed something was amiss. While [Bao Qianzhang] led two constables to charge into the warehouse to rescue, [Gui Ye] intercepted them on the way, wielding a cane to force the three back with just one strike, and rushed into the hiding place of the two saints ahead of them.
1:49:50|1:49:59|The police officer was overwhelmed by the thick smoke and fell to the ground. [Gui Ye] carefully traced the source of the smoke and soon discovered a hidden room. With a sinister smile, he then charged forward, breaking through the door.
1:50:1|1:50:18|The thick smoke here obscures the sight of the fire. [Gui Ye] is an expert in playing with fire. If it were an ordinary day, he would have been aware of it. However, now presented with the opportunity to hunt down and exterminate the Great Tang's two victories, [Gui Ye] unsuspectingly rushes into the trap. He doesn't see the emperor and empress, but hears [Yuchi Zhenjin] shouting loudly.
1:50:31|1:50:46|It turned out that this was a trick by [Di Renjie]. The two men in the carriage that day were [Yuchi Zhenjin] and the police officer Zhou Jin. Knowing that they had been tricked, and seeing [Yuchi Zhenjin] disappear into thin air like blue smoke, [Gui Ye] sneered and then swiftly fled towards the door.
1:50:48|1:51:7|As the mechanism near the corridor suddenly activates, two sharp blades block the way, and a row of wooden stakes sends [Gui Ye] flying into the fighting room, where he is surrounded by [Yuchi Zhenjin] and Zhou Jin. He lets out a sharp cry, and flames ignite all around him. On the other hand, the other two cover their eyes with headscarves to guard against his illusions. The desperate struggle begins.
1:51:50|1:51:58|Upon finishing speaking, Di Renjie saw the leader of the Wind Demon tribe walking in the air, as if walking on flat ground, and went straight from the roof to the ground.
1:52:10|1:52:29|The leader of the Wind Demon clan, burdened with deep hatred, seeks revenge wholeheartedly. Disregarding Di Renjie's words, the two sides engage in battle once again at the temple. The black-robed figure, already occupying the high ground, emerges amidst a barrage of arrows, throwing dozens of spherical concealed weapons into the crowd, filled with billowing smoke, instantly shrouding the entire battlefield.
1:52:30|1:52:40|[Di Renjie] covered his nose and mouth, hurriedly called for everyone to scatter and take cover, while on the other side, inside the warehouse, [Gui Ye] used illusions to create endless flames, unaware that this place had already been prepared.
1:52:40|1:52:50|The entire storage room floor was covered with yellow phosphorus and other materials. Once touched, they would ignite, and in an instant, the room was filled with flames. [Gui Ye] was helpless, fleeing in panic as the fire spread.
1:52:50|1:53:0|Zhou Jin identified the position by listening to the sound, pressed the mechanism with the long knife in his hand, and saw four iron bars rising from the ground to form a prison cell, imprisoning [Gui Ye] inside, unable to escape.
1:53:1|1:53:8|[Yuchi Zhenjin] flashed to the beam and said, while [Gui Ye] in the prison cell wailed in agony, ultimately self-immolating to death.
1:53:8|1:53:26|On the other side of the square, the crowd was engaged in a fierce battle. Despite Di Renjie's strong martial arts skills, he was overwhelmed by multiple opponents. A black-robed figure hooked his ankle with a rope, causing him to fall to the ground. Shatuo exclaimed in shock, covered his mouth and nose, and hurried to provide support.
1:53:26|1:53:40|Surrounded by black-robed figures, three ropes were thrown out to tightly bind [Di Renjie]'s limbs, suspending him in the air. His Kanglong Mace had fallen to the ground, and [Shatuo], with limited skills, had no choice but to pick up the mace and flee in the chaos.
1:53:41|1:53:50|Yi An and other police officers saw [Di Renjie] being subdued. In a moment of urgency, they bravely fought the enemy, causing the situation to become even more chaotic. The leader of the Wind Demon tribe feared a mutation, so he once again activated the magic wheel to perform illusion techniques.
1:53:50|1:54:4|At this moment of chaos, fear gripped the hearts of everyone. The wrathful Demon Wheel transformed into the furious Vajra, his hair standing on end as he soared into the air, his bloodshot eyes striking fear into all. His towering figure seemed to connect heaven and earth, and with a long roar, echoed through the ages.
1:54:5|1:54:17|In addition, even the black-robed figure transformed into a monster, donning spiritual armor and sprouting wings on its back, resembling a furious dragon. It opened its blood-filled mouth and swooped down towards the crowd, plunging them into another fierce battle.
1:54:17|1:54:37|Fortunately, just after [Yuchi Zhenjin] dealt with [Gui Ye], he arrived in time and saw [Di Renjie] being held by the furious Vajra. He leaped into the air and threw three flying knives, cutting the rope controlling the monster and saving [Di Renjie]. This move undoubtedly attracted the attention of the foreign races on the field. As a result, a nearby evil dragon bared its fangs and claws and lunged towards [Yuchi Zhenjin].
1:54:37|1:54:48|Ignoring the need to rush to support Di Renjie, Yuchi Zhenjin had no choice but to entangle with the evil dragon on the roof. At the same time, the rest of the people were also under the crazy counterattack of the foreign tribe, with police officers being seriously injured and falling to the ground from time to time.
1:54:48|1:54:55|In the blood-stained Dali Temple, [Ding Xun] tried to hold the high ground but was defeated at this moment, showing the fierceness of the attack.
1:54:56|1:55:12|Seeing [Ding Xun] falling from the arrow tower and being entangled by a fierce dragon, [Di Renjie] hurried to the rescue. He threw his small shield to drive away the dragon. Meanwhile, [Shatuo] was already in a difficult situation, struggling to protect his Kanglong Spear. Seizing the opportunity, he shouted to [Yuchi Zhenjin].
1:55:15|1:55:26|Immediately, the Dragon Spine Staff was thrown out. [Yuchi Zhenjin] on the roof had just finished dealing with the entangled evil dragon and had not reacted yet. He saw the Dragon Spine Staff flying towards him, so he hurried to intercept it, but unfortunately, he was one step too late and was
1:55:26|1:55:52|Two evil dragons intercepted, soaring to snatch the Konglong Staff and throwing it to [Chief of the Feng Mo Tribe], standing on the eaves. The Chief of the Feng Mo Tribe raised his arms and shouted that the Great Tang would be destroyed. The tribe members echoed the call, creating a tumultuous scene. In contrast, [Di Renjie] and his companions looked ashen-faced. [Shatuo], seeing this, forgot to resist and was attacked by the evil dragons. At that moment, they heard someone behind them cursing in a harsh tone.
1:55:53|1:56:0|The person dual-wielding short knives with swift and fierce movements, striking deadly blows from both sides, is none other than [Shui Yue].
1:56:6|1:56:20|[Shui Yue] returned just as [Yuan Ce] emerged, and sure enough, the two of them engaged in conversation when a giant ape suddenly charged towards them. It leaped over the head of [the leader of the Wind Demon tribe], snatched the Dragon Slaying Mace from his hand, and climbed onto the opposite rooftop. The one controlling the giant ape was none other than [Yuan Ce].
1:56:21|1:56:39|After finishing speaking, [Feng Mo, the leader of the Wind Demon tribe], waved the magic wheel in his hand and took the initiative to attack. The furious Vajra was surrounded by billowing blood energy, accompanied by countless evil dragons flying by its side. For a moment, the world changed color as the furious Vajra beckoned and countless evil dragons rushed towards the giant ape. [Yuan Ce] clenched the dragon mace in one hand.
1:56:39|1:56:47|With one hand holding the long halberd against his chest, Di Renjie signaled the giant ape to stand up straight, swinging his arms. The evil dragon in the air could not easily approach him, only able to dance around him, unable to get close.
1:56:47|1:57:11|Looking at the giant ape, with feet as swift as the wind, tearing through thunder, advancing and retreating like a raging wind sweeping through, opening and closing grandly, as if a thunderbolt from the heavens. With little effort, it crushed all the evil dragons, then stood on the eaves, roaring defiantly at the Wind Demon Chief. Everyone on the scene couldn't help but marvel at the unparalleled power of [Yuan Ce]'s giant ape. Victory seemed certain in this battle, as the furious golden ape advanced towards the giant ape.
1:57:11|1:57:33|With worries in their hearts, they each sought a safe corner and looked up at the battlefield. [Yuchi Zhenjin] and [Di Renjie] approached the arrow tower to observe. The heavily injured [Shatuo Zhong] called for [Shui Yue] to support him against a pillar, gazing at each other. Then they saw a furious figure with a body hundreds of feet tall, causing the ground to shake as he walked. Muscles rippled across his body, bloodshot eyes glaring, and a rosary hanging from his neck, connected by numerous skulls.
1:57:33|1:57:41|With two dragon heads as decoration, eyes wide open in anger, a silk ribbon dancing under the armpit, the momentum is immense, reaching the heavens and the earth, a giant ape in front of it, no bigger than an ant.
1:57:41|1:58:5|Once again, it opened its bloody mouth and spat out three spherical tentacles. [Yuan Ce] remained unchanged, allowing the tentacles to entwine around him, and he was swallowed into the fleshy ball along with the giant. The onlookers in the temple were terrified, their faces changing color in an instant. Fortunately, after a moment of hesitation, the tentacles naturally separated and released [Yuan Ce]. With a single arm pushed forward, the three tentacles obeyed his command, darting out and pinning themselves above the furious eyes, mouth, and nose of the Golden Guardian.
1:58:5|1:58:16|King Kong roared in pain, his eyeballs bursting out of his body and staring fiercely at [Yuan Ce]. Then, the more than a hundred eyeballs rushed towards the giant ape and hit him solidly, as if they had a life of their own.
1:58:16|1:58:23|The eyeballs surrounded the giant ape from all directions, and once hit, they turned into a muddy and sticky pool of blood, sticking to the giant ape and making it difficult to move.
1:58:23|1:58:51|In the blink of an eye, [Yuan Ce] and the giant ape were wrapped into a slightly squirming mass of rotten flesh. The furious Gorilla took a step forward, swung its arms, and punched directly at the mass of flesh, splattering blood everywhere. However, there was no trace of [Yuan Ce] in it. A roar came from the top of the Gorilla's head, the mighty Mountain Ape. With this roar, the furious Gorilla's body burst inch by inch, blood splattering everywhere but leaving no trace on the ground. [Yuan Ce], the guardian beast under Master's seat, was nowhere to be seen.
1:58:51|1:59:1|Possessing the divine power to unravel illusions, known for cutting off worldly desires and upholding the law, [Di Renjie] remains aloof from the common people. Locking the heart's monkey to achieve tranquility, do not let the mind's horse roam freely.
1:59:1|1:59:14|This ape, embodying the practice of the horse, [Yuan Ce] has reached the realm of transformation. The illusion technique of the Wind Demon Clan leader is unable to harm him in the slightest. Now that the illusion has been broken, the Wind Demon Clan leader is severely injured, falling from the sky in a sorry state.
1:59:14|1:59:23|The mask fell off, revealing the true face, showing the execution scars of the past, with crisscrossing gullies, terrifying. Meanwhile, [Yuan Ce] sent a giant ape to guard the roof.
1:59:24|1:59:36|Entering the room gracefully, like a gentle breeze without stirring up any dust, with hands clasped in front of the chest and robes fluttering, he appeared from a distance as if bathed in Buddha's light. However, upon closer inspection, he seemed quite ordinary. Only the sound of his slow voice could be heard as he began to speak.
1:59:47|2:0:5|Listening to what [Yuan Ce] said, the leader of the Wind Demon clan once again recalled the suffering he had endured in the past, the cries of his people echoing in his ears. Unable to control the intense pain in his heart, decades of careful planning now ruined in an instant. In this moment of turmoil, consumed by boundless hatred, he let out a roar and charged towards [Yuan Ce] with the magic wheel in hand. [Yuan Ce], calm and composed, with a dignified demeanor.
2:0:5|2:0:19|Extending his palm, [Di Renjie] used one finger to immobilize the leader of the Wind Demon Clan from a distance, then dragged him closer. With a horizontal palm push forward, the leader was seen flying out and falling to the ground. Monks, sweeping the floor, fear of harming ants' lives, cherish the silk that covers the lamp for the moth.
2:0:19|2:0:34|Even when facing the most evil person, two iron pear blossoms flew out of the magic wheel and tightly wrapped around [Yuan Ce]'s head.
2:1:12|2:1:29|At the moment when he was about to take action, the leader of the Wind Demon Clan was also entangled by the magic wheel on his head. It seemed that it was [Yuan Ce] who cast the illusion. The iron pear blossom made by the vajra locked the enemy's head firmly and was unbreakable. The leader of the Wind Demon Clan was attacked by [Yuan Ce] with the same illusion technique, falling deep into hell, feeling all kinds of pain.
2:1:50|2:2:7|At this moment, compared to the calm [Yuan Ce], the leader of the Wind Demon clan was in great distress, kneeling on the ground tightly clenching his fists. It seemed that there was a fear in the demon wheel that made it difficult for him to resist. Finally, after being calmly explained by [Yuan Ce], the leader of the Wind Demon clan let go of his grudges and killing intent, and the demon wheel on top of his head slowly unfolded and disappeared.
2:2:7|2:2:16|On the other side, [Yuan Ce] then turned the Dragon Scepter to amplify the power, the magic wheel shattered for a moment, the treasure appeared as before, and then he looked towards the Wind Demon Chief and spoke.
2:2:26|2:2:41|Experiencing the torment of hatred and illusions in hell, although the leader of the Wind Demon Clan is not as enlightened as [Yuan Ce] in his spiritual practice, he can still see through the illusions and knows the depth of his sins. Overwhelmed with remorse, he kneels with his clan before [Yuan Ce] in tears, putting an end to the battle.
2:2:41|2:2:52|[Yuan Ce] nodded to the Wind Demon Clan in return, then called the giant ape under the roof down, and turned around to lift the Konglong Flail with both hands, kneeling towards [Di Renjie], and said,
2:3:2|2:3:20|After returning the Dragon Spine to its original owner, slowly bowing, [Di Renjie] did not dare to be presumptuous. He had knelt beside [Yuan Ce] during the ceremony, and now he received the Dragon Spine with both hands, bowing his head in a show of respect. The giant ape stood up, pounding his chest with both fists and laughing towards the sky, signaling that the battle here had come to an end.
2:3:20|2:3:35|Upon hearing this laughter, the guard outside the temple relaxed a bit, and then saw the people inside all standing up, each holding a weapon. [Tang Gao Zong] spoke up.
2:3:38|2:3:44|He also disguised himself and encouraged the guards before speaking.
