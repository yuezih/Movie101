0:2:39|0:2:50|Five beams of light shot straight to the top of the sky, and in an instant, five gaps opened in the dense dark clouds, and the light turned into divine power pouring down, shattering the four evil beasts one by one.
0:2:59|0:3:3|The scroll closes, and twinkling stars converge to form the three characters [Lang Ming], marking the official start of the film.
0:4:9|0:4:12|Lang Ming accurately knocked down the pursuers with an apple.
0:4:19|0:4:21|He accurately stepped on a lump of stone.
0:4:47|0:4:50|Speak up, a large hand snatched away a candy from a child before it could reach his mouth.
0:5:18|0:5:22|People on the street scattered in an instant.
0:5:57|0:6:5|The sidekick gestured towards the bamboo shoots on the ground, but the boss took them and stuffed them into his own mouth.
0:6:39|0:6:57|[Lang Ming] fumbled to open a window, slipped in like a wisp of smoke, only to find himself in a public bathhouse. He fell into a tub, spinning uncontrollably, crashing forward. The screens that shielded people bathing were also knocked into disarray by him.
0:7:7|0:7:15|Lang Ming, who ran out, ran into Shanpao for help. He smelled the danger and quickly mobilized his hearing, sensitively capturing the information around him.
0:8:0|0:8:5|Following his mother, [Lang Ming] swaggered away, and the stunned [Shanpao] stood still after being slapped twice.
0:8:25|0:8:32|The scene shifts, with a signboard bearing three characters of Jiugong standing tall amidst the misty mountains and forests.
0:8:32|0:8:49|In the Jiugong Ridge, [Tian Jingsha], the leader, is sitting cross-legged under a huge ancient tree, with leaves slowly falling. [Tian Jingsha] closes his eyes, practices his magic, and the fallen leaves on the ground rush towards him from all directions, spinning rapidly to form a huge half-circle dome that covers him coldly.
0:8:51|0:9:12|In front of him, darkness turned into a sea of fire, and a fierce beast with bright red eyes appeared in the air, approaching him. [Tian Jingsha] suddenly opened his eyes, and at that moment, a pair of hands grabbed his shoulders and pulled him out, causing the canopy of leaves to fall abruptly.
0:9:20|0:9:23|[Tian Jingsha] looked at the fallen leaf in his hand, lost in thought.
0:10:16|0:10:31|The scene shifts to a gambling den. Amidst the clamor, Mother [Sister Mei] pulls [Lang Ming] into the crowd. [Lang Ming] focuses, listening intently, trying to catch the movement of the three dice in the dice cup.
0:10:38|0:10:48|[Sister Mei] placed her bet, the clock was ticking, and it turned out to be exactly as Lang Ming had said. The gambling continued, but Lang Ming was casually eating an apple, leaning on the table and listening nonchalantly.
0:11:0|0:11:22|Lang Ming, who guessed right every time, almost took away all the money. The seemingly innocent boss angrily pressed a button hidden under the table. In the dark, a mechanism was activated, and a wooden ball shot out. The table shook, altering the original dice numbers. However, this slight movement was still keenly captured by Lang Ming.
0:11:31|0:11:33|Sister Mei and Lang Ming were thrown out of the hall.
0:14:11|0:14:15|The kite flew out with Little [Lang Ming].
0:14:27|0:14:32|There was no more news. Dad's figure gradually disappeared, and time returned to this moment.
0:15:5|0:15:26|The scene shifts to a quiet jungle deep in the forest. The girl Susie extends her foot, stepping on the water and moving forward, her dress following her steps, creating a mysterious light. She walks to the center, squats down, and points her finger at the water. In an instant, a powerful force quickly sweeps open the calm water, revealing the figure of [Jia Ye].
0:15:57|0:16:1|Taking the medicine, [Sister Mei] walked out of the pharmacy without saying a word under the watchful eyes of the shopkeeper.
0:16:9|0:16:31|In the dark night, [Sister Mei] stood sadly in front of the house. Suddenly, a huge beast's foot appeared behind the wall, and the scene shifted to the sky full of stars, where [Lang Ming] was lying on the eaves, howling like a wolf.
0:16:44|0:17:3|The windmill beside him started to turn, and he sensed something unusual. Immediately, he picked up his cane, leaped up, stepped on the tiles, slid down the roof agilely, and landed accurately. Following the strange sound, he rushed out of the village, ready to investigate.
0:17:3|0:17:12|In the hazy night with smoke, the chirping of cicadas and birds was continuous, which [Lang Ming] did not notice. At this moment, [Shanpao] and his two accomplices were following him stealthily.
0:17:30|0:17:51|Looking ahead at the gloomy scene, the three of them ran away in a hurry, while [Lang Ming] continued to walk deeper into the mountains. At the same time, under the sky, [Su Xi] was at a loss facing the floating Tarot in the magical power. He reached out to grab it, but was fiercely counterattacked by the magic power, causing a magic array to light up on the giant rock.
0:17:56|0:18:10|Suddenly, he heard footsteps and quickly hid behind a rock. In the valley, an unusual airflow and the sound of spinning tops entered Lang Ming's ears. He approached the floating top and reached out his hand slowly.
0:18:14|0:18:21|Please note that a huge force swept across the ground, causing the magic array on the giant rock to disappear.
0:18:45|0:19:0|Seeing the valley on the verge of collapse, [Su Xi] leaped in front of the howling wolf. Although [Lang Ming] fell to the ground, he used the momentum to quickly get back on his feet. Su Xi swiftly launched an attack towards [Lang Ming], kicking at his waist, and Tuo Luo fell to the ground.
0:19:1|0:19:18|The rocks trembled again, and taking advantage of Su Xi's distraction, [Lang Ming] quickly picked up the spinning top. However, he was firmly grabbed by the wrist by the opponent, kicked in a vital spot, and then kicked in the air. The spinning top soared up, and as [Lang Ming] jumped to grab it, he unexpectedly missed. Concentrating his mind, he opened his mouth and caught it in the next moment.
0:19:19|0:19:38|Hit by a palm from behind by Su Xi, [Lang Ming] was forced to swallow it and fell directly down as the ground suddenly cracked. On the other side, in a pitch-black forest, a monstrous creature with a sinister face, sharp teeth, and scales all over its body slowly walked by, its crimson eyes glowing, breathing heavily, emitting a dangerous aura.
0:19:39|0:19:54|The scene shifts to a vast grassland, with the morning light shining in. [Lang Ming], who is in a daze, slowly opens his eyes. In front of him, a butterfly flutters by from the sky, but almost instinctively, [Lang Ming] covers his eyes with his hand.
0:19:54|0:20:7|It climbed up, stumbling and groping, and walked to the edge of a bend in the river. After reaching out to explore, it cupped some water and drank it down. Then, it hazily opened its eyes, and two small fish darted away.
0:20:8|0:20:15|In the river, his reflection was clearly visible.
0:20:28|0:20:40|He looked at everything in front of him in disbelief - the jungle, grassland, ancient trees, strange rocks, flowers. Sunlight filtered through the leaves, and little squirrels peeked out curiously.
0:21:0|0:21:18|On the boundless grassland, [Lang Ming] joyfully runs freely. He somersaults, opens his arms, and gallops exuberantly, rolling down the hillside. Suddenly, four beautiful figures bathing in the mountain spring come into view.
0:21:24|0:21:51|Lang Ming chased after the butterfly, floating on the ground and wriggling with the caterpillar, imitating the frog's water jump, he was so happy. Suddenly he thought of the spinning top that he had swallowed.
0:22:6|0:22:21|Arriving at the village entrance, [Lang Ming] covered his eyes and walked inside, but things seemed a bit off.
0:22:27|0:22:48|The schoolyard at Xiaoyanggang is deserted at the moment, in ruins, with dark clouds looming overhead, creating a chilling and eerie atmosphere. [Lang Ming] took a few steps forward, feeling extremely lost. Suddenly, a massive figure appeared behind [Lang Ming].
0:22:56|0:23:10|It turned out to be the monster that appeared in the woods before. The monster opened its bloodthirsty mouth towards [Lang Ming], frightening [Lang Ming] into fleeing in panic.
0:23:17|0:23:34|The monster chased after him relentlessly, like a wild horse running amok. [Lang Ming] ran for his life, pulling down goods from the shops along the street to block the monster and buy himself some time. Taking advantage of the monster getting tripped by a wine barrel, [Lang Ming] swiftly hid behind a water tank at the side of the street.
0:23:35|0:23:48|The monster didn't notice and continued to chase straight ahead, finally disappearing. [Lang Ming] gasped heavily, leaning against the wall and running to the back of the alley. Just as he sat down, he saw three people with pumpkins on their heads.
0:24:17|0:24:33|As soon as the words fell, the monster called Rakshasa leaped out from behind the three of them, the ground tiles flying up as it launched a fierce attack. With a deafening roar, [Rakshasa] soared into the air, passing over the ferocious head, landing and turning to block his way, step by step approaching him.
0:24:36|0:24:47|[Little Demon] continued to approach [Lang Ming] menacingly, causing him to tremble and step back. In a moment of carelessness, [Lang Ming] fell to the ground, and [Little Demon] leaned down, his face twisted into a terrifying expression, getting close to his face.
0:24:47|0:24:57|In a critical moment, Lang Ming fumbled for a small knife. He picked it up and stabbed Little Demon in the forehead. Little Demon writhed in pain and thrashed around, and a white-tailed eagle swooped Lang Ming up into the sky.
0:25:7|0:25:24|Welcome to the newly fallen Lang Ming, who was leisurely falling when suddenly a surge of pulse waves rushed in and caught him in mid-air, carrying him forward. Lang Ming felt both curious and pleased. The next moment, a vertically inserted stick appeared out of nowhere and directly hit the crotch of Lang Ming's split legs.
0:25:47|0:26:7|The man with short hair among the five threw a magic stick to block the path of [Lang Ming], and suddenly a fire rose up around him. Then two phantoms flashed by, only to see the girl with bangs leaping into the air and striking [Lang Ming] with a palm, instantly silencing the surroundings. Meanwhile, the man in a cloak gathered a force of water and ice, rushing towards [Lang Ming].
0:26:7|0:26:19|The girl with a ponytail followed closely behind, transformed into a bright light and leaped into the sky, then transformed into four long-haired [Rakshasas] that crossed into the ground, immediately trapping it tightly.
0:26:19|0:26:27|On the side, a burly man extended his palm, and a huge force swept up the tiles and bricks on the ground. With a clenched fist, the tiles and bricks came crashing down, completely pinning down [Lang Ming].
0:26:48|0:26:53|Zhan Chi showed the palm print to everyone,
0:28:9|0:28:16|An object flew towards him and rolled to the ground, it was the Excalibur Seal he sold to the children.
0:28:39|0:28:58|Lang Ming squatted down, silently picking up the seal under the villagers' hostile gaze. Another child looked at the fake Xia Lan seal in his hand, feeling disappointed and angry, then threw it at Lang Ming. Other children followed suit, one after another seals hitting Lang Ming, leaving him feeling guilty and sad.
0:28:58|0:29:4|Trust was betrayed, and what seemed like joy turned out to be a scam, leaving the children crying in grievance.
0:29:11|0:29:17|[Qian Jun] hurriedly flew to the pile of tiles to check the situation, but it was already deserted.
0:29:24|0:29:30|Lang Ming is running at full speed. Finally home, Lang Ming looks forward eagerly, only to see a scene of desolation and ruins.
0:29:51|0:30:1|He walked towards it in disbelief, only to see the collapsed gate, fallen trees, and dilapidation.
0:30:28|0:30:36|As soon as the words fell, the only remaining toilet collapsed with a bang. A wave of despair hit, and [Lang Ming] fell to his knees on the ground.
0:30:54|0:31:7|Suddenly, dark clouds gathered overhead, thunder roared, and raindrops fell. [Lang Ming] knelt on the blue stone slab, crying out in pain, then suddenly stood up and crawled towards the ruins.
0:31:13|0:31:19|The tile is lifted, revealing the mother's purse stuck in the gap. [Lang Ming] picks up the purse.
0:32:4|0:32:19|Lang Ming and Little Demon were fighting again, and soon Lang Ming was subdued by Sister Mei. Sister Mei let go of Lang Ming, stood up, and hesitated for a moment before speaking.
0:32:28|0:32:37|[Lang Jing] looked fierce, but the other party completely ignored him. The scene shifted, [Bi Ting] and [You Budong] were walking in the mountains.
0:32:54|0:33:0|In the misty surroundings, [Shanpao] arrived in a field.
0:33:18|0:33:25|Suxi grabbed the ankle of Shanpao, who suddenly appeared, and forcefully dragged him backwards, swinging him back and forth in the air.
0:33:25|0:33:39|Two little brothers panicked and fled at the sight, while Lang Ming on the side watched in shock. The scene then shifted to a forest, where Lang Ming was vigorously drilling wood to make fire. When Su Xi handed him a piece of roasted meat, he turned his head away in a pretentious manner.
0:33:44|0:34:4|Time flies, scenes constantly change and shuttle. The wolf howls follow Su Xi, walking through the myriad forests, vast grasslands, bountiful wheat fields, steep suspension bridges, cliffy rocks, experiencing thunder and lightning, rain and clear skies, sudden changes in stars, watching the red sky in the rainy season, the setting sun, and the faint morning light.
0:34:5|0:34:24|Thus, with their own different purposes in mind, the two of them continued on their journey, forging ahead without hesitation. As the scene shifted to the mountains, with clear skies and gentle winds, the two were crossing the river on a boat when suddenly, a crocodile emerged from the water. Lang Ming was startled and panicked, frantically waving the oar to speed forward.
0:34:25|0:34:47|Su Xi jumped up and stood on the back of the crocodile, driving away Lang Ming. Lang Ming abandoned the boat and ran all the way to the edge of the cliff. Before catching his breath, he was pushed down by Su Xi with a finger. The crocodile below the cliff opened its mouth, and Su Xi threw down a rope, caught Lang Ming, and hung him upside down, swinging him up and down.
0:34:53|0:35:0|In the next scene, in the mountains and forests, Lang Ming follows behind Su Xi, clutching his stomach, his face showing pain.
0:35:17|0:35:37|Lang Ming had just left when eerie bird calls sounded all around. A large bird swooped down, but Su Siling dodged it skillfully. The bird then transformed into a human form, revealing itself to be [You Budong]. [You Budong] landed gracefully, and Su Siling hurriedly climbed up the water. However, Bi Ting suddenly appeared and kicked out, causing Su Siling to dodge and fall into the water, with [You Budong] following closely behind.
0:35:37|0:35:45|Lang Ming hit him hard with a burst of energy, smashing him into a tree. Just then, Lang Ming, who had just finished urinating, turned around and saw Su Xi lying on the ground.
0:35:52|0:35:58|Many years ago, since Xia Lan sealed the Poor Qi, the world has been free from this evil force for a long time.
0:36:17|0:36:35|Suddenly, Lang Ming's pupils flashed with color, then she launched an attack towards Bi Ting. Bi Ting struck her back with a palm, but Lang Ming split into two, passed through her body, knocked Bi Ting down, and her body collapsed as well.
0:36:50|0:36:56|Lang Ming looked at his palm and ran towards Su Xi, but he picked her up in one go.
0:37:39|0:37:44|She sat up and pushed [Suxi] aside.
0:38:9|0:38:32|He groped around with his hand and slapped [Su Xi] hard across the face. A glint of color flashed in [Su Xi]'s eyes. He viciously lunged at [Lang Ming]. [Lang Ming] used his feet to forcefully push against his face.
0:38:41|0:38:56|Lang Ming kicked him out with force. Su Xi crazily rushed towards Lang Ming, but he dodged and made him fall to the ground.
0:39:30|0:39:41|No one looks down on him because he is blind. His family lives in a courtyard with a large locust tree, especially in spring.
0:40:15|0:40:40|Becoming a true Xia Lan, from then on taking care of justice. Unconsciously, it was already dawn, Lang Ming was getting tired of talking and almost fell asleep. Beside him, Su Xi finally calmed down and lay quietly on the ground. The scene shifted, and the two walked in the cave.
0:40:51|0:40:54|Su Xi took a few steps forward and said slowly.
0:41:30|0:41:39|Sure, indeed, light was shining through the front cave wall. The camera passed through a small hole in the wall and looked down, where a man was leading a group of people kneeling and bowing towards a body.
0:42:0|0:42:6|Lang Ming bowed his head on the cave wall, which was the head of the guardian god, and the branches supporting him suddenly broke.
0:42:16|0:42:43|In an instant, everyone screamed and scattered, their heads falling heavily, kicking up a cloud of dust. Those who ran to the side turned back to look up, locking eyes with Lang Ming and Sister Mei. The next moment, the two were tied up tightly, and the villagers whispered and discussed among themselves. The villagers paused to glance at the two before continuing to whisper to each other.
0:42:51|0:42:58|The villagers pointed forward, and the three big characters of the village were prominently written on the plaque. Watching the villagers whispering to each other, [Lang Ming] shook his head.
0:43:39|0:43:43|Lang Ming struggles to pull his hand out of the rope.
0:44:5|0:44:7|Lang Ming stood in front of everyone.
0:44:28|0:44:50|It gathered its energy and slapped a nearby big tree with its palm, causing the whole scene to fall silent. The villagers stared blankly as the wolf howl lasted for a few seconds, yet the tree remained unchanged. In an awkward moment, [Su Xi] shook her head helplessly. [Lang Jing] then blew a few breaths towards the tree, but still no response.
0:44:56|0:45:0|The villagers were stunned, and after a moment, they raised their arms and cheered together.
0:45:16|0:45:27|Behind him, the villagers extended a shovel and pushed Lang Ming down. The villagers below cheered and caught him, then tossed him high in the air, along with Sister Mei who was also repeatedly thrown into the air.
0:45:57|0:46:0|Amid cheers, the two were carried forward triumphantly.
0:46:4|0:46:15|The scene shifts to a mountain forest, where a suspension bridge appears amidst swirling mists. Chen Yue, Qian Jun, and [Lang Ming], three Xia Lan warriors chasing the Rakshasa, stand at the head of the bridge.
0:46:42|0:46:50|In a mountain spring, villagers put on masks, play music, dance the ritual dance, and scatter flower petals into the air, the sacrifice begins.
0:46:55|0:47:21|The villagers sat cross-legged around the boxing ring, following the music, pointing their fingers at [Lang Ming] and [Little Demon] who faced each other in the center of the ring. [Old Village Chief] stood in the middle with a long staff in hand. The two looked around in fear as the sky darkened, the bonfire lit up, and the villagers stood in rows along the mountain slope, dancing in unison.
0:47:45|0:47:56|Water is the medium through which we communicate with the gods, placing him in the water and expressing through singing and dancing.
0:48:23|0:48:27|This is the accountant of the village, named [Lang Ming].
0:48:46|0:48:52|The two naked individuals were very embarrassed, with Su Sihuan hugging her arms and showing a look of difficulty.
0:49:11|0:49:27|As evening fell and the wind howled outside, Su Xi stood alone in the room. Her back was reflected in the bronze mirror. Suddenly, the mirror vibrated and emitted a burst of spiritual light. Su Xi reached out and pointed at it, and the figure of [Jia Ye] appeared in the mirror.
0:50:20|0:50:38|He turned around, facing the cave wall, revealing a sinister smile. Suddenly, the cave wall shook violently, rocks collapsed, and a huge eye emerged, filled with a poisonous and cruel charm. Its pupils continuously contracted, moving back and forth, scanning the surroundings.
0:50:51|0:50:59|Lang Ming returned to the village, on the hillside at night, leaning weakly against the door of the thatched house with the sound of wolves howling.
0:51:21|0:51:24|He turned around, only to see a hillside outside the house with people lining up.
0:51:48|0:51:52|Lang Ming lay down disappointedly on the grass. Susie picked up the windmill that fell from Lang Ming.
0:52:18|0:52:20|Su Xi looked at the windmill, lost in memories.
0:53:4|0:53:25|Xiao Susie took out a match and lit the firecrackers on the ground that Shanpao's gang had inserted. The flames climbed up step by step along the fuse. Shanpao's second in command squatted on the ground, desperately blowing at the flames with his mouth. Lang Ming, however, remained motionless, closing his eyes and listening intently.
0:53:25|0:53:42|At the last moment when the fire was about to burn out, he leaped and grabbed the firecracker. In an instant, the firecracker carried him up into the sky. After spinning wildly in the sky for a few rounds, he flew towards Little Susie. The two embraced each other and flew straight ahead. After a few more spins, they soared towards the clouds.
0:53:43|0:53:50|In the next moment, [Shanpao] explodes, blooming into a firework in Lang Ming's palm, and the scene shifts to Little Lang's home.
0:54:53|0:54:56|Suzi went to seek help from [Old Village Chief].
0:55:9|0:55:17|[Old Village Chief] calculated with a pinch of his fingers. The two hurriedly crossed over the werewolves lying on the ground and quickly left.
0:55:40|0:55:57|The wooden door opens to reveal a scripture pavilion, with scrolls stacked layer upon layer on high shelves on both sides. The pavilion is entirely made of wood, with the wood showing signs of age and decay. A finely carved ancient book is placed on the central high platform.
0:55:57|0:56:7|The [Old Village Chief] in this scene dipped his hands into the basin, carefully washing them before taking out a handkerchief to dry them. He then put on gloves and opened the ancient book.
0:56:13|0:56:29|He flipped open the first page, with Laomin and Susie peering over from both sides. He privately smeared the first page with snot and threw it behind him. The book depicted a little figure resembling the [Old Village Chief].
0:57:5|0:57:24|A hero suddenly appears. He uses a spinning top as a medium to seal the energy into the top, sacrificing his own life in the process. To commemorate this unnamed hero's return to the village,
0:57:26|0:57:32|He erected his statue. [Lang Ming] turned to look at Susie.
0:57:59|0:58:1|Su Xi silently lowered her head,
0:58:29|0:58:31|Su Xi handed the ancient book to [Lang Ming] and turned away.
0:58:55|0:59:11|The scene shifts to the hillside of the village, where several villagers are wielding hammers, nails, and saws, building a small thatched house. They are busy constructing a stone wall and erecting a wooden sign on the house that reads "Reserved Parking for Xia Lan".
0:59:16|0:59:23|In the room at night, Susie got up from the bed and accidentally tripped over Lang Ming lying on the floor. The two looked at each other in silence.
0:59:35|0:59:57|The air was filled with music as it surged, causing time in the village to accelerate. [Lang Ming]'s belly grew bigger and his movements became more difficult. Su Xi, like an expectant father, began to take on the responsibility of caring for [Lang Ming]. In the flickering fireflies of the night, he lay on the ground, fanning [Lang Ming] to keep cool.
0:59:57|1:0:11|In the shade of the trees during the day, he stole sour fruits and fed them to [Lang Ming]. In the hot courtyard, he watched over a small stove, brewing medicine for [Lang Ming]. He guarded [Lang Ming] through every restless night, giving the only bed to [Lang Ming].
1:0:14|1:0:33|They fetch water in the fields, practice yoga with a pregnant woman by the mountain spring, and shuttle back and forth at the market. They watch the sunrise and sunset together, the flocks of mountain sparrows, the ebb and flow of the tides, and the rolling clouds. Su Si, who was attracted by several beautifully dressed girls, also began to learn how to apply face powder for [Lang Ming].
1:0:33|1:0:40|At the market, seeing Su Xi hesitating to pick up a bell bracelet, [Lang Ming] secretly bought it for her.
1:0:46|1:1:2|In the small house at night, moonlight penetrated through the window, sprinkling on the bed, and together with the candlelight on the table, they played a beautiful silence of the summer night. Lang Ming looked at the bracelet in his hand, looked at Su Xi sleeping in the shed, and a happy smile spread across his lips.
1:1:2|1:1:8|A few fireflies gently brushed across [Su Xi]'s cheeks, illuminating her small face.
1:1:9|1:1:18|Thus, in the countless days and nights of companionship, the young man and the young woman harbored their naive and shy love for each other, carefully hiding it in their hearts.
1:1:35|1:1:37|[Suxi] supports Lang Ming, the atmosphere is extremely bad.
1:2:49|1:3:4|The door of the thatched house was slowly pushed open, and Lang Ming crawled out with a groan. Sister Mei rushed over and helped him sit down. He held his stomach, rubbed it, and then took out the bracelet, handing it to Sister Mei.
1:3:4|1:3:10|In the background, the setting sun painted the sky brilliantly, as if time stood still at that moment.
1:3:27|1:3:35|Su Xi hesitated to reach out to Tuo Luo, but ended up grabbing the bracelet. Lang Ming caught up and found Su Xi wearing the bracelet.
1:3:45|1:4:3|Suddenly, a loud noise came from the distance. The two hurried to the village and found it deserted, with no signs of life. At that moment, a child came out of a house crying, and the two ran towards him, one in front and one behind.
1:4:12|1:4:33|The Rakshasa roared angrily at Lang Ming, and Su Xi instantly teleported in front of Lang Ming. Suddenly, a cloud mass swiftly spun down and landed, revealing the figure of [Jia Ye] in the surging mist. As the cloud dispersed, he slowly descended amidst the swirling dust and falling leaves.
1:4:39|1:4:42|Lang Ming was holding her hand as Su Xie was talking to her.
1:4:58|1:5:5|Jia Ye sucked the demon into his palm, revealing a sinister smirk. The next moment, the demon opened its big mouth behind Lang Ming.
1:5:6|1:5:10|[Jia Ye] went to rescue Lang Ming's Su Xi and brought her back.
1:5:11|1:5:16|[Little Demon] chased after Lang Ming and kept biting him, then a white-tailed creature heavily swung him to the ground.
1:5:17|1:5:27|He struggled to sit up, [Rakshasa] was opening its sharp fangs and slowly approaching. Suddenly, another [Rakshasa] leaped out from the other side and pounced on the one attacking Lang Ming.
1:5:33|1:5:44|[Jia Ye] gathered a ball of energy in his hand and struck fiercely towards the two struggling [Rakshas]. The energy ball surged upwards with tremendous force, sucking in the two beasts, one after the other.
1:5:49|1:6:13|A bird call came from the sky, a few beams of light flashed across the screen, and the Five Heroes Lan descended from the sky, leaping from the roof to the ground, facing [Jia Ye]. The last to land, Zhan Chi, saw Jia Ye, surprised and angry. The Five Heroes Lan immediately prepared for battle.
1:6:38|1:6:54|Zhan Chi took the lead and led the Xia Lan towards [Jia Ye]. [Jia Ye] stood still, waved his hand, and a huge spiritual power instantly knocked down all the Xia Lan, then disappeared with Susie in the mist.
1:7:4|1:7:24|Watching the backs of the Xia Lan group as they left, [Lang Ming] stood still in place, feeling as if his heart had turned to ashes. Suddenly, thunder roared in the sky, dark clouds gathered, and a torrential rain poured down, ruthlessly drenching the destroyed roofs and houses. He pounded his head and walked into the scripture pavilion, appearing in front of [Old Village Chief] and the villagers.
1:7:55|1:7:58|Brought disaster to the village.
1:8:24|1:8:27|Even in the face of incredibly powerful enemies,
1:8:35|1:8:42|Looking at the kind gazes of the villagers and the doll of the deity given to him by the child, [Mao Nier] murmured,
1:8:55|1:9:0|He hurriedly left after saying that, and [Old Village Chief] watched his back, muttering to himself.
1:9:4|1:9:26|The scene shifts to the mountains, with [Mao Nier] standing at the peak, facing the faint morning light on the horizon. He closes his eyes, relying on his sense of hearing. In the distant valley, the bell bracelet worn on Susi's wrist jingles with each step, producing a crisp sound that travels across the mountains and reaches [Mao Nier]'s ears.
1:9:26|1:9:38|He had a cloth tied over his eyes, plunging the world into darkness once again. In the eerie cave, [Jia Ye] took out a spinning top, held it in front of his nose, and sighed deeply, saying intoxicatedly.
1:10:40|1:10:46|Su Xi angrily rushed towards him, but was thrown to the ground by a single glance from him. He grabbed Su Xi's hair.
1:11:15|1:11:29|Speak up, [Jia Ye] left with pride, while Su Xi looked at the bracelet on her wrist in pain. On the other side, the divine bird Haidongqing from Jiugong Ridge brought news to lead [Tian Jingsha] and Yi Henshi.
1:11:53|1:12:9|He grabbed Su Xi's neck, his clenched fist paused in mid-air. He released Su Xi, slowly lowered his fist, and followed her into the depths of the cave. Inside was a vast space, surrounded by sturdy rock walls, with a dangerous aura looming in the air.
1:12:10|1:12:23|Only a fierce panting was heard, and three demons peeked their heads out from the crevices in the rock wall. Lang Ming looked up, the stairs spiraled up in the rocky cliffs, with several demons locked on each level.
1:12:39|1:12:44|Lang Ming looked in horror as countless identical demons flashed past him.
1:13:36|1:13:42|In the scene, [Sister Mei] transforms into a demon, rushes out the door, and Lang Ming, understanding everything, kneels down on the ground in despair.
1:14:35|1:14:51|Suddenly, the crystals hanging at the top of the cave began to shake and shatter, falling down in pieces, causing the mountain to tremble violently. [Zhan Chi] roared, broke through the rock wall, rushed out of the stone railing, and ran out in a hurry.
1:14:51|1:15:0|Under the sky, the upper-level demons fell one after another, clustering and rolling downwards, instantly disappearing in all directions, with all beasts running wildly and crashing outwards.
1:15:7|1:15:24|Mao Nier searched among the beasts, seizing the spine of a Rakshasa and being dragged forward, causing mountains to crumble and the earth to split wherever they passed. As the beasts squeezed into a narrow canyon, Suxi caught up, while Mao Nier continued to cry out in despair amidst the flying dust.
1:15:30|1:15:45|In the midst of chaos, Lang Ming was thrown to the ground, constantly dodging the beasts running past him. Suddenly, he looked up and saw a tree trunk horizontally inserted in the canyon. He leaped up and tightly hugged the tree trunk.
1:15:46|1:16:2|Looking up, the setting sun was like snow, on the vast plain, the demons were rushing into a huge pit in front of them like the wind and evil spirits. In an instant, countless demons fell into the deep clouds, all of which were seen by [Tian Jingsha] in the Nine Palaces Spirit.
1:16:2|1:16:11|[Tian Jingsha] flew over the mountains and forests, transformed into a human form, and delivered the message to [Bi Ting]. At the same time, [Bi Ting] was leading a group of heroes to rush forward swiftly.
1:16:23|1:16:35|At this moment, a Rakshasa that had already run to the edge of the giant pit suddenly stopped. He slowly turned around and looked towards [Lang Ming]. Beside him, the other Rakshasas were still galloping, with yellow sand filling the sky and dust flying.
1:16:38|1:16:42|On the other side, [Lang Ming] is running towards his mother, struggling forward in the midst of the beasts.
1:16:50|1:17:2|The awakened mother, running against the oncoming herd of beasts, ran towards [Lang Ming]. The small figure was constantly engulfed in rolling smoke and dust, repeatedly knocked down by the herd.
1:17:8|1:17:23|At the moment when he was knocked down the pit, he firmly clung to the edge of the pit, struggling to climb up. Suddenly, he used all his strength to grab the ground, leaped up, and rushed towards [Lang Ming]. But unexpectedly, he collided head-on with a Rakshasa leaping forward.
1:17:23|1:17:31|The mother, unable to resist, finally disappeared into the bottomless pit with her frail figure, leaving [Lang Ming] crying out in despair.
1:17:35|1:17:56|Lang Ming, who wanted to jump off the cliff, was tightly embraced by Little Demon. He tried to break free, but eventually, under immense sorrow and anger, he lost his strength and sat paralyzed on the ground. At this moment, Jia Ye suddenly appeared.
1:18:13|1:18:21|He turned around, and [Tian Jingsha] was standing behind him, with other [Xialan] appearing one after another.
1:19:5|1:19:21|The air suddenly quieted down, and the Glutton did not arrive as expected. [Jia Ye] stood awkwardly in place, while the [Lang Ming]s regained their senses, with a command from [Tian Jingsha]. They swiftly moved up, with fleeting shadows, launching attacks on [Jia Ye] one by one.
1:19:21|1:19:36|[Jia Ye] stood in place, continuously leaping and spinning, throwing punches while dodging the attacks from [Xia Lan], kicking him to the ground. Then, he struck out with three bursts of energy, which rushed towards [Jia Ye], causing the ground to collapse and flames to rise.
1:19:36|1:19:49|Who knew, the next moment, [Jia Ye] rose from the fireworks, shot straight up into the sky, a huge surge of demonic energy rushed out violently, fiercely smashing towards the ground, in an instant, the [Lang Ming]s all fell to the ground.
1:19:49|1:19:59|[Jia Ye] floated in the air, slowly descending. Suddenly, a huge boulder fell from above, crushing him. [Tian Jingsha] and the other two leaders [Xia Lan] rushed towards the top and set up a hanging formation.
1:20:0|1:20:20|The valiant [Lang Ming] soared into the formation, just as [Jia Ye] broke through the top. A bright light burst out of the formation and rushed down. He extended his palm to resist with all his might, but was ultimately knocked down to the ground. In an instant, the ground shattered and the divine stone splattered. As the heroes descended from the sky and the dust settled, the mountain suddenly began to tremble violently.
1:20:29|1:20:41|In the sand, the mountain erupted with flames, causing the ground to collapse. Rocks flew and the wind howled, with yellow sand filling the sky. The heroes were shaken to the ground, unable to stand.
1:20:51|1:20:53|In the sky, a giant palm emerges bathed in flames.
1:21:4|1:21:19|The giant palm pressed down, grabbing the mountains, amidst billowing smoke and shattered mountains. The ferocious face of the glutton emerged from the firelight, as the earth continued to tremble and crack. Rocks kept sliding down, and the fierce wind swept the debris into the air.
1:21:30|1:21:34|Su Xi wielded her knife to stab Jia Ye, but he activated his spiritual power and turned to stab Lang Ming.
1:21:38|1:21:57|Lang Ming fought desperately against the looming blade, he was forced to the ground by Su Si, while at the same time, Tao Tie had already broken out of the mountain completely. He roared to the sky, and in an instant, countless fireballs surged out, swiftly flying over the mountains and smashing towards the village. In the blazing light, people scattered and fled.
1:21:57|1:22:6|Suddenly, a fireball shot towards a child, and [Chen Yue] arrived just in time to block it as it fell, while [Qian Jun] produced a weapon to intercept the fireball.
1:22:7|1:22:31|Zhan Chi manipulated the hanging array to shatter the falling rocks. On the other side, Jia Ye was still controlling Susie. Susie swung down, and Lang Ming felt darkness before his eyes. After a brief silence, he opened his eyes to see a few drops of blood falling on his waist, with a dagger inserted in Susie's chest.
1:23:26|1:23:29|The screen shows the Xia Lan fighting hard to protect the people.
1:24:0|1:24:25|The bell bracelet fell with Susie's hand, lying in Lang Ming's arms, breathless. Susie's body turned into a faint glow and floated into the air. Behind her, the raging fire continued, engulfing the houses, leaving the world in ruins.
1:24:28|1:24:42|Lang Ming trembled as he picked up the fallen bell bracelet from the ground, overwhelming grief enveloping him. He knelt on the ground, crying uncontrollably. Then, he closed his eyes tightly, angrily raised his head, tears freely flowing down his cheeks.
1:24:52|1:24:55|On the other side, [Jia Ye] sat up and sarcastically exclaimed in surprise.
1:25:1|1:25:7|Facing Jia Ye, Mao Nier stood up shakily, but then collapsed unable to support herself.
1:25:22|1:25:49|He rushed over, punching [Jia Ye] in the face again and again. Gradually, he lost strength, tears welling up in his eyes. The surrounding rocks began to crack, falling down and knocking [Mao Nier] to the ground. After a moment, he struggled to get up, picked up the dagger from the ground, and stood at the edge of the huge pit.
1:25:55|1:26:0|He tilted his head back, raised the dagger, and slashed his own eyes, letting blood flow freely from them.
1:26:21|1:26:29|Above the sky, a fireball soars, with [Mao Nier] standing at the edge of the void. Slowly spreading her arms, she leaps down and falls into the billowing smoke and dust.
1:26:50|1:27:10|A powerful force instantly filled his entire body, following him as he fell. It roared out like a gust of wind, piercing through the swirling mist. At that moment, the windmill also suddenly dropped, lifted by the wind, hovering in the air. With a loud bang, Mao Nier fell heavily to the ground, kicking up dust and causing tiles to shatter.
1:27:10|1:27:14|He fell into a coma, and beside him, the bell bracelet rolled out slowly and fell to the ground.
1:27:15|1:27:37|At the same time, [Tao Tie] was still rampaging in the mortal world, his fireballs piercing through the mountains and forests, constantly crashing towards the village. Wherever he went, there were ruins and scorched earth, with flames reaching the sky and corpses scattered all over. People screamed in panic and fled, while [Tian Jingsha] stood in the crowd, determined to fight to the death.
1:27:45|1:27:56|The Xia Lan team emitted a bright light, shooting upwards, piercing through the mud and dispersing it, forming a huge barrier that covered the sky, as the Taotie and Huandou fiercely smashed towards the barrier.
1:28:1|1:28:14|The Xia Lan team kept exerting force, holding on tightly, bridging the gap in the barrier that had been smashed open, but the voracious power instantly caused the barrier to rupture again. The surrounding people watched all this, feeling confused and hopeless.
1:28:21|1:28:31|[Tao Tie] clenched his fist and smashed towards the barrier again. The Xia Lan were struggling to resist, but were knocked down by the immense force. In an instant, the barrier shattered and collapsed.
1:28:34|1:28:53|The Taotie looked down coldly, disdainful of all beings, as the wolf howled windmill spun past and turned into ashes when approaching the Taotie. At the same time, the Taotie's giant palm, enveloped in billowing smoke, slowly descended towards the crowd. On the devastated land, the flames reflected on the faces of people in despair.
1:28:54|1:29:4|Tears and fear had lost their voices at this moment, everyone had given up struggling, holding their loved ones tightly, closing their eyes, waiting quietly for the arrival of death.
1:29:10|1:29:30|With a loud bang, Lang Ming's palm struck a suddenly appearing light prism. In an instant, Lang Ming's palm shattered, and he angrily spewed out flames. The light prism, however, remained unscathed, unmoved. Sand and stones flew, and a wolf's howl was lifted by a force, suspended above the ground, continuously rising upwards.
1:29:32|1:29:40|People looked up, in the midst of swirling clouds and mist, the wolf howled and stood tall in front of [Tao Tie], leaving [Shanpao] and the others in awe.
1:29:55|1:30:15|The child looked at the faint imprint on the seal in his palm, reaching his hand towards the sky. The children, strong and determined, followed suit. Shanpao helped the leader check his empty palm, struggling to hold out his hand towards the sky. Soon, the people firmly extended their palms, determined to fight alongside the wolf people.
1:30:17|1:30:27|Watching the provocateur in front of him, [Chen Yue] angrily opened his big mouth, threw out numerous fireballs flying towards Lang Ming. Lang Ming dodged agilely while flying straight towards [Chen Yue].
1:30:45|1:31:5|Amidst the billowing black smoke, Lang Ming rode the wind with a wolf's howl, swiftly circling around [Chen Yue]. In an instant, [Chen Yue] was enveloped by layers of black smoke, with flames and lightning flashing together. The next moment, a beam of light shot out from the black smoke, soaring into the sky. [Chen Yue]'s body then shattered into pieces with a thunderous crash.
1:31:5|1:31:10|At that moment, a strong wind rose, and yellow sand filled the sky, leaving everyone astonished.
1:31:12|1:31:33|Shortly after, Lang Ming reached out and held the Tarot in his palm. The Tarot floated up and stood on the dome, spinning rapidly. In a moment, with spiritual light surrounding it, only to see the electric light and black smoke carrying the scattered body of the glutton, being instantly sucked in. On the other side, the mountain began to collapse, and Jia Ye, who was unconscious on the ground, suddenly opened his eyes.
1:31:33|1:31:53|It was already too late to dodge, as the giant rock fell instantly, burying it deep in the ruins and smoke. The black smoke rolled with electric light and fierce fire. In the air, the gluttonous corpse was still being continuously rolled in by the gyro. The previously eaten snails were now falling one after another, as if poured onto the ground, all rolling down the mountain.
1:31:53|1:32:4|A spiral fork soared into the air, instantly gathering and dispersing scales, transforming into a human form. For a moment, the scene was grand and majestic, with people not knowing what was happening, fleeing in fear.
1:32:7|1:32:21|After the half-flash, the world finally quieted down. The slaughter furnace fell to the ground, spinning a few times with a clang before lying still. [Tian Jingsha] stepped forward, picked it up, and the heroes and villagers followed behind.
1:32:21|1:32:30|At this moment, Lang Ming has disappeared without a trace, the sky is calm, like the clearing after rain, the clouds gathering and dispersing, only a few clouds peacefully floating in the sky.
1:32:35|1:32:53|Three months later, on the lush plain, the Wolf Clan is guiding Shanpao to fly with the wind, with several children. Old Village Chief is hanging on the kite. Suddenly, the kite string breaks.
1:33:10|1:33:12|Sister Mei slapped him hard.
1:33:31|1:33:33|On the other side, the villagers of that village are repairing the statue of the deity.
1:34:1|1:34:11|Time flew by, another three months had passed, [Lang Ming] stood at the edge of the cliff, holding a bell bracelet, silently gazing into the distance. Suddenly, he put away the bracelet.
1:34:34|1:34:49|The spinning top that seals the gluttonous spirit once belonged to him. The test of the Jiugong Ridge Xia Lan is to use one's own vitality to make this top spin.
1:34:59|1:35:8|Spinning the top rapidly. That is the transcendent element beyond the five elements - wind.
1:35:21|1:35:26|In the Nine Palaces Tomb, he smiled as he prepared to leave, then suddenly he stopped in his tracks.
1:35:48|1:36:3|The scene returns to this moment, [Tian Jingsha] looks at the spinning top in his hand, then gazes at the departing figure of Lang Ming, just like he once watched the departing figure of Lang Ming's father, so firm and brave, shining brightly in the enveloping sunset.
1:36:4|1:36:10|The film ends here, thank you for watching. Stay tuned for a post-credits scene.
1:36:44|1:36:57|Now let's talk about the post-credits scene. In the bustling market on the campus, [Lang Ming] is leisurely strolling with his dog. Suddenly, a familiar voice is heard up ahead.
1:37:7|1:37:16|[Chen Yue] rushed over to the crowd. She grabbed the girl's arm, but was pushed away by the other party.
1:37:38|1:37:48|The girl shook her head helplessly and walked away. She brushed past [Lang Jing], the bell bracelet jingling. After a few steps, she stopped, turned around, and spoke.
