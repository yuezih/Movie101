0:3:7|0:3:14|The nun finished speaking and slightly turned her head, pulling out a sharp dagger from her sleeve and handing it to [Nie Yinniang]. [Nie Yinniang] shifted her gaze to the dagger.
0:3:14|0:3:35|Respectfully bowing, she received the item with both hands, then discreetly gripped the dagger behind her back, gazing towards the distant frosted wood. Following [Nie Yinniang]'s line of sight, she saw a military force advancing through the dense forest. There were roughly a few hundred of them, holding high the banners of their fiefdoms, marching grandly across the plains. The pace of the troops was not fast,
0:3:35|0:3:49|It is clear that they are unaware of the imminent danger. [Nie Yinniang] quietly moves through the dense forest with her hands behind her back, and soon she finds her prey. She stares fixedly at the target in front of her.
0:3:49|0:3:56|Silently and stealthily, [Nie Yinniang] turned a corner and followed up. The target of this assassination was the man riding a tall horse at the front.
0:3:57|0:4:19|[Nie Yinniang] rushed forward in three or two steps, her hand wrapped around the thick tree trunk, leveraging a 90-degree turn before leaping up. The dagger in her hand had already sliced across the man's neck. The warhorse did not notice anything unusual about its master and continued to move forward unhurriedly, while the man maintained his previous expression but slowly slumped down.
0:4:19|0:4:35|Finally fell off the horse. The surroundings seemed to become noisy, yet it was as if nothing had happened. The sunlight was still bright, evenly scattered through the cracks of the leaves in the woods, while the gentle breeze kept blowing, causing the leaves to sway continuously. The next moment...
0:4:35|0:4:44|The camera turns to a room. A man with a beard sits in the main seat, holding a butterfly out to a young boy in front of him.
0:4:46|0:4:55|The boy was originally trying to catch a butterfly. Upon hearing the instructions, he turned his palm upwards. The man then carefully transferred the butterfly into his hand.
0:4:58|0:5:8|The boy lifted his head and stared at the butterfly intently. After glancing at the man, the boy lifted his head to search for the butterfly's figure.
0:5:9|0:5:15|The little boy's head was almost tilted ninety degrees, constantly following the flight path of the butterfly, pointing upwards.
0:5:18|0:5:23|The wet nurse squatted to the side, glanced up at the sky, and then handed a leather ball to Tian Ji'an.
0:5:28|0:5:33|The little boy's attention was all on the butterfly and he didn't want to take the ball.
0:5:34|0:5:51|The man pointed to the ball in the wet nurse's hand, then reached out to the boy, who seemed to have given up his obsession with the butterfly. He sat down on the ground and started playing with the ball with the wet nurse. The man looked kindly at the little boy, while the boy continued to play absentmindedly.
0:5:51|0:6:9|And when the wet nurse gestured for him to roll the ball over, he suddenly became interested. He happily took a few steps back, pushed the ball towards the wet nurse with force, then took a few more steps back, increasing the distance. The two of them rolled the ball back and forth, playing joyfully.
0:6:9|0:6:20|The man sat cross-legged on the heated brick bed, looking content. He squinted his eyes, with a slight smile on his lips, even his sharp Guan Yu-like eyebrows softened. He watched the playing children beside him.
0:6:20|0:6:37|While picking up peeled lychees from the nearby desk and stuffing them into his mouth, little did he know that an assassin was crouching on the ceiling beam directly above him. [Nie Yinniang] quietly observed from above, waiting for the right moment to leap down.
0:6:37|0:6:54|Nie Yinniang approached the man step by step, holding a sharp weapon in her hand. At this moment, the man was sitting on the kang with his head tilted, already fast asleep, holding a sleeping child in his arms. Nie Yinniang quietly watched for a while before taking two more steps forward.
0:6:54|0:7:9|The man only realized at this moment. His first reaction was to protect the child, but [Nie Yinniang] did not attack him. Instead, she took a few steps back and walked away. The man quickly got up, carefully placed the child on the bed, and grabbed the scabbard at the edge of the bed.
0:7:9|0:7:24|Thrusting out the long sword towards [Nie Yinniang], she seemed to have eyes on her back, deftly turning around to knock down the sword with a dagger. Finally, she glanced at the man, then turned around to lift the door curtain, walked around the screen and went out, leaving only the astonished man behind.
0:7:24|0:7:43|In a room filled with sleeping servants. The next moment, [Nie Yinniang] arrives at a Taoist temple, which is built against the mountain and exudes a sense of seclusion. A young Taoist nun is vigorously sweeping the dust off the steps with a large broom. Upon seeing [Nie Yinniang] step onto the platform, she stands respectfully to the side and bows in greeting.
0:7:43|0:8:6|Tian Ji'an didn't stand up until Nie Yinniang left, while Nie Yinniang never stopped walking. The next moment, she bowed her head respectfully, knelt silently at the entrance of the main hall.
0:8:11|0:8:30|[Nie Yinniang] neither responded nor argued, maintaining her original posture. After a long time, the nun finally walked out of the main hall with a flick of her duster. She ignored [Nie Yinniang] kneeling at the door, turning her back to her.
0:8:35|0:8:51|[Nie Yinniang] still knelt with her head down, making it hard to discern her expression. The nun seemed accustomed to her attitude and continued to gaze calmly outside the courtyard. At this moment, our film's assassin [Nie Yinniang] officially began her story. The region was fragmented,
0:8:51|0:9:7|The Tang Dynasty emperor was transformed into the Zhou Dynasty emperor, with actual control only over a small area around Chang'an. Therefore, starting from Emperor Tang Daizong, all subsequent Tang emperors attempted to weaken the power of regional warlords and restore central authority. Emperor Tang Dezong, the son of Emperor Tang Daizong,
0:9:7|0:9:30|The large-scale campaign against the three towns in Hebei ended in complete failure. Not only did it fail to eliminate the three towns, but it also led to the mutiny of the imperial army used to suppress the rebels. In the end, Emperor Tang Dezong had to issue a self-blaming edict. Tang Dezong, with unfulfilled ambitions, died in melancholy, and his son, Emperor Tang Shunzong, was also in poor health.
0:9:30|0:9:47|After reigning for only one year, he abdicated. But in the generation of his grandson, Emperor Xianzong of Tang, there was great ambition, continuing to struggle against the regional governors. [Nie Yinniang]'s father, [Nie Feng], is an old general of Weibo, former commander of the Imperial Guards, and current Duke of Douyu.
0:9:47|0:10:6|The camera then shifts to a luxurious residence, where [Tian Jing] sits gracefully on a couch, with a plum blossom mark between her eyebrows. A maid behind her is focused on inserting a golden hairpin into the high bun of the lady. After silently arranging all the hair accessories,
0:10:6|0:10:18|Taking the tray from the maid, [Nie Yinniang] stood quietly behind the lady. Suddenly, the lady turned her head to look towards the door, then turned the bronze mirror in her hand upside down on the table.
0:10:22|0:10:42|Madam seemed somewhat surprised to hear this news, she suddenly withdrew her hand from fiddling with the jewelry and sat up straight involuntarily. In the main hall, [Nie Yinniang] lowered her eyes, holding a dusting cloth while sitting on the kang, while [Nie Yinniang] stood quietly with her head bowed to the side. The curtains on her right side swayed with the wind.
0:10:42|0:11:0|Through the crack, a group of people can be seen hurrying past. [Nun] glanced slightly and then sat up straight when she saw who was coming. The former lady stood in front of [Nun] and even bowed with both hands. This [Nun] turned out to be the princess.
0:11:2|0:11:26|The nun helped the lady up from the ground. After nodding slightly and bowing to the lady, the nun walked out without looking back. The lady frowned, glanced at Nie Yinniang, then quickly turned and followed the nun to see her off.
0:11:26|0:11:42|The nun is Princess Jiaxin, the twin sister of Princess Jiacheng. Thirteen years ago, she took away Nie Feng's daughter Nie Yinniang and trained her to become a peerless assassin. Now she has come to return Nie Yinniang to the Nie family and to take her childhood sweetheart, Nie Tian Shi.
0:11:42|0:12:1|The life of Wei Bo's Marquis [Tian Ji'an]. Watching his daughter finally return home, [Lady Nie] couldn't contain her emotions and had already sent someone to prepare a bath for her daughter. Following the maid's instructions, servants carried in bucket after bucket of steaming hot water into the exquisite bathtub. Then a maid entered with a tray,
0:12:1|0:12:15|Various precious medicinal herbs are evenly spread on the water surface. Then, a servant pours a bucket of water into the bathtub. During the pouring process, she picks up some root-like medicinal herbs and puts them into the bathtub in an orderly manner.
0:12:15|0:12:35|The maid watched attentively as the old nanny sprinkled the herbs into the bath. After the nanny finished, the maid skillfully took the small plate and handed over the next batch of herbs. The nanny took the herbs, grabbed a small handful, sniffed carefully, confirmed it was correct, and then continued to sprinkle them into the bathtub. The weather outside was clear and sunny, with a gentle breeze.
0:12:35|0:12:53|A small tree with a trunk as thick as an arm stands alone on the grassland. In the distance, a group of horsemen pass through the woods, slowly treading on the lawn. The people on horseback are all dressed in luxurious clothes, indicating their extraordinary status. The few men in front and behind the horse team are not smiling, dressed in discreet military officer uniforms.
0:12:53|0:13:7|Vigilantly observing her surroundings, in the center of the horse team is a woman, riding alone. Her hair accessories and attire set her apart as more noble than the others, even the horse beneath her is adorned with pearl decorations. At this moment,
0:13:7|0:13:22|[Nie Yinniang] sat naked in the prepared bathtub, with herbal residue still clinging to her smooth shoulders and tears clearly visible on her face. She hugged her knees tightly with her arms, her eyes revealing an unprecedented sense of confusion.
0:13:22|0:13:38|A remarkable woman sits under an ancient tree, cradling a Nine Heavens Jade Lute in her arms. She lightly touches a plum blossom on her forehead, with her hair coiled high and adorned with simple yet exquisite golden accessories of imperial craftsmanship. Her attire is far from ordinary.
0:13:38|0:13:58|The delicate silk robe, embroidered with intricate peony patterns, is as thin as a cicada's wings, with the folds shimmering with the unique luster of silk. But what catches the most attention is the woman's appearance, which bears a striking resemblance to a nun. She is Princess Jiacheng, the sister of Emperor Dezong of Tang, and the twin sister of the nun Princess Jiaxin.
0:13:58|0:14:4|The ambitious military governor Tian Ji'an in Weibo Town is the adopted son of Princess Jiacheng.
0:14:4|0:14:23|Princess Jiacheng's marriage to Tian Xuxian back then was clearly a political mission. Not only did she groom [Tian Ji'an]'s uncle [Tian Xing] to be the commander of the Imperial Guards, but she also adopted [Tian Ji'an], who was born to a lowly mother, as her foster son, deliberately cultivating him to be Tian Xuxian's heir. However, due to the interference of Emperor Tang Dezong, ...
0:14:23|0:14:44|The Emperor's nephew, Tang Shunzong, passed away within a year, followed by the Princess Jia Cheng who also departed not long after due to excessive grief. At this moment, her delicate jade hand lightly plucked the strings of the qin.
0:14:52|0:14:58|The fingertips are like swords and spears, powerful and resounding, in stark contrast to the sweet face.
0:15:14|0:15:45|There is a sense of loneliness and desolation, the princess kneels in the courtyard for a long time without speaking. At this moment, the maids are dressing [Nie Yinniang] in an outer garment embroidered with auspicious cloud patterns, with a silk short jacket and long skirt underneath, while she remains expressionless like a puppet. The old nurse stands in front of [Nie Yinniang] earnestly explaining.
0:15:45|0:15:59|And [Nie Yinniang] didn't even bother to lift her eyelids after hearing this. It took her a long time before she blinked her eyes, revealing a hint of contemplation. Suddenly, she took a few steps forward, furrowed her brows, and remained silent, even when dressed in women's clothing and a flowing skirt.
0:15:59|0:16:14|She still exuded a layer of gloomy atmosphere, the maids who were changing her clothes stood quietly behind her, no one dared to make a move, not even the old nurse dared to speak easily. [Nie Yinniang] and her cousin [Tian Ji'an] grew up together, innocent and carefree, but
0:16:14|0:16:32|The princess's choice disrupted [Nie Yinniang]'s once beautiful life, and returning home again was like returning to a different world. She became the sharpest weapon of the court, while her cousin was the most feared enemy of the court. The scene of Princess Jiacheng playing the zither under the tree is still vivid in her mind. Perhaps at that time...
0:16:32|0:16:49|She had already anticipated the fate of these two individuals. For Princess Jiacheng, on one side was her own flesh and blood brother, and on the other side was a political marriage she was forced into, with a husband who harbored sinister intentions and a stepson who lacked loyalty. The balance in her heart could easily tip to the other side without hesitation.
0:16:49|0:17:6|However, decades of intrigue and scheming had already worn her out both physically and mentally, her life was like a story of dancing with a green mirror. This was a war without gunpowder. At this moment, [Nie Tian Shi] had already regained her former gentleness, sitting in the main seat of the hall, looking out the door.
0:17:7|0:17:21|With a faint smile on her face, the exquisitely arranged pastries and fruits were already on the table. The nanny pushed aside the curtains and entered the main hall, followed by [Nie Yinniang] who had changed back into her sharp assassin attire. Following her lead,
0:17:21|0:17:45|[Nie Yinniang] arrived at the right side of the main hall and knelt in front of a kind old lady. [Nie Tian Shi] paused her eating and gestured for [Nie Yinniang] to stand up with a smile, one hand holding a bowl and the other reaching out. Upon noticing her daughter entering the main hall, [Nie Tian Shi] couldn't help but look cautiously.
0:17:45|0:17:58|In the past. In her gaze towards [Nie Yinniang], besides the unique anticipation of a mother towards her child, there was even a hint of nervousness. After paying respects to the old lady, [Nie Yinniang] walked towards [Nie Tian Shi] and sat down on her other side.
0:17:58|0:18:16|But after [Nie Yinniang] sat down, [Nie Tian Shi] seemed hesitant to speak. She picked up the embroidered pouch on the table and gently placed it in front of [Nie Yinniang]'s desk. [Nie Tian Shi] withdrew her hand and quietly gazed at [Nie Yinniang]'s face.
0:18:16|0:18:30|However, [Nie Yinniang] did not respond. She expressionlessly reached out to take the embroidered pouch on the table. [Madame Nie] let out a sigh and lowered her eyes. [Nie Yinniang] opened the pouch and took out a not very delicate jade ornament from inside.
0:18:42|0:18:51|[Nie Yinniang] held the jade pendant in her hands, gently rubbing it, restraining her emotions with hidden patience.
0:19:9|0:19:28|[Mrs. Nie] cautiously raised her eyes to look at [Nie Yinniang], and after seeing [Nie Yinniang]'s expression, [Mrs. Nie] lowered her eyes again, with a hint of helplessness and emotion in her expression.
0:19:36|0:19:44|The golden-rooted carriage is drawn by six dragons to rule the world, and it is the emperor's vehicle for travel.
0:20:24|0:20:30|[Mrs. Nie] quickly suppressed her emotions and looked at [Nie Yinniang] with a hint of earnestness in her eyes, while [Nie Yinniang] remained silent for a long time.
0:20:50|0:21:16|Mrs. Nie referred to the Sixth Master as Tian Ji'an, and they made a betrothal at that time.
0:21:38|0:22:5|[Mrs. Nie] at this moment, with her head slightly tilted back, tears shimmering in her eyes, still trying hard not to let them fall. [Mrs. Nie] endured for a long time, leaning her arm on the desk, leaning slightly towards [Nie Yinniang]. After repeating this sentence, she remained motionless in her original posture.
0:22:5|0:22:20|Without even lifting her eyes to look at [Nie Yinniang], she covered her face with the embroidered pouch and silently cried. Even in front of her biological mother, she did not want to lose control like this. However, how could the grudges of 13 years be forever hidden in her heart.
0:22:20|0:22:31|Although the princess truly adores [Nie Yinniang], she was not able to rely on her parents since childhood, and it was also the princess who severed the bond between her and her childhood sweetheart.
0:22:31|0:22:42|Now that she has completed her training, being heartless and breaking loyalty is not enough, assassinating the high officials is still not enough. The purpose of being sent back is unexpectedly to have her kill her beloved. And at this moment, Tian Ji'an is in a different state.
0:25:20|0:25:38|This made the Weibo Jiedushi extremely displeased with [Tian Ji'an]. He grabbed the jade object beside him, full of anger, and threw it down the steps. Then he leaped up from the collapsed seat, staring at [Tian Xing] with a gloomy look in his eyes. [Tian Ji'an] paced back and forth on the stage for several rounds.
0:25:38|0:25:56|The small cushion that had just been propped up on the bed. He scanned the hall aimlessly and once again fixed his gaze on [Tian Xing]. Sitting beside [Tian Ji'an] was his eldest son, who seemed accustomed to his father's violent temper. But at this moment, [Tian Xing] was very angry.
0:25:56|0:26:15|He turned his head to look at the ground, his brows furrowed tightly, looking sulky. In contrast, [Nie Feng] sitting on the right appeared much calmer, sitting upright at the desk without changing his expression, staring straight ahead. Little did they know that there was still one person in the council hall of the Governor's Mansion at this moment.
0:26:15|0:26:30|She was quietly observing the movements below, only to see [Nie Yinniang] crouching silently on the beam, her face cold and still like a wax figure, her gaze fixed on a spot without shifting for a long time. The camera then cuts to...
0:26:30|0:26:49|At this moment, [Tian Ji'an] is standing in the center of the study, teaching his eldest son hand-to-hand combat techniques. Following [Tian Ji'an]'s instructions, the eldest son successfully brings him down to the ground. [Tian Ji'an] then gets up and continues to demonstrate the movements. He extends his hands to grasp his son's arm, signaling him to break free. After the son's first unsuccessful attempt,
0:26:49|0:27:5|[Tian Ji'an] let go and took two steps back, then reached out to grab him again. But this time his son took the initiative, before [Tian Ji'an] could grab him, he hugged his waist like a reckless man and knocked him down to the ground. After [Tian Ji'an] got up, he smiled, picked up his son and spun around.
0:27:5|0:27:14|He indulgently patted his bottom before letting him go. His son looked at Tian Ji'an, exhausted but with a smile on his face.
0:27:14|0:27:30|The sun was shining outside, and a man in a black cloak walked out of the hall, walked along the corridor to the end, turned a corner and disappeared. This man is [Tian Ji'an]'s personal bodyguard [Xia Jing]. Not long after, footsteps sounded again, and [Xia Jing] returned.
0:28:50|0:29:7|At this moment, not far from the edge of the woods, [Nie Yinniang] decisively kicked a soldier to the ground, then lightly leaped onto the nearby pavilion. She then grabbed the soldier next to her, knocked his weapon out of his hand with the hand holding the long sword, and threw him off the pavilion.
0:29:7|0:29:23|Nie Yinniang was seen fighting with several soldiers and retreating into the woods, with the soldiers closely following. Before long, Nie Tianshi took the three children back to the house. The eldest son played with a ball on his own, while the two younger sons sat obediently on the side.
0:29:23|0:29:41|Eating snacks with relish, the boss immediately put away his playful demeanor and stood obediently to the side. [Nie Tian Shi] also collected her thoughts, lifted her skirt gracefully, and stood up to wait for the master to enter. At this moment, [Tian Ji'an] walked into the room with his sword in hand and stood in front of [Nie Tian Shi].
0:29:43|0:30:6|[Tian Ji'an] seemed very impatient upon hearing this. He frowned, glanced outside, walked to the other side of the bed, threw his sword on it, and sat down heavily. The woman, seeing him sit down and remain silent, returned to her stool.
0:30:6|0:30:24|Leaning slightly to one side, she seemed accustomed to [Tian Ji'an] adopting this attitude, so she was not angry. At this moment, two children sat quietly between their parents, holding bowls, paying no attention to the thoughts of the two adults. The sun was shining outside, but the atmosphere in the woods was unusually eerie as they looked up.
0:30:24|0:30:30|Under the shade of the trees, blocking most of the view, the backlit leaves appeared dark and oppressive. Standing under the trees was a woman, [Nie Yinniang].
0:31:5|0:31:20|Gazing carefully, the gentle eyes seemed to be looking at a lover. After a while, she lowered her hand, walked around an ancient tree, and stared fiercely at the building not far away, which was the residence of [Tian Ji'an].
0:31:20|0:31:42|The night was deep, and the moonlight sketched out the distant mountains. A magnificent residence, resembling a palace, was hidden in the darkness, with only a faint light emanating from the corners of the roof, indicating signs of human presence. Two servants parked a cart filled with firewood on the side and were lighting the braziers in the courtyard.
0:31:42|0:31:57|Suddenly, two spirited horses galloped past, and the person who came was [Nie Tian Shi] and her entourage. [Nie Tian Shi] on horseback was serious, keeping her lips tightly closed and not looking around. At this moment, the huge landscape painting screen at the door ensured the privacy indoors.
0:31:57|0:32:11|A physician squats by the bed with a serious expression. General [Nie Feng] stands quietly with his sword by his side, showing no emotions. Soon, guided by a servant, [Nie Tian Shi] enters the inner room, and only then does General [Nie Feng] come to his senses and greet her.
0:32:26|0:32:51|Nie Tian Shi heard this, sighed silently, and her hand, which had been raised, weakly dropped to her sides. But soon she regained her composure, adjusted her expression, and looked at General Nie Feng. With a melancholic expression, Nie Tian Shi nodded almost imperceptibly at General Nie Feng. For a moment, the two looked at each other in silence. At this moment,
0:32:51|0:33:6|Nie Tian Shi's elder brother Tian Xing lay on the bed with his eyes closed, completely unaware of his surroundings. Only the slight rise and fall of his body with each breath reminded those in the room that he was still alive. The physician had clearly been treating him for a long time, as evidenced by the bandages on his right arm.
0:33:6|0:33:23|The silver needles were already inserted. The physician then selected from the assistant's cloth bundle, picked up another needle, and bent down to pierce into Tian Xing's left arm. The physician slowly twisted the silver needle in hand, while carefully observing Tian Xing's facial expression.
0:33:23|0:33:39|Until Tian Xing's eyelids trembled slightly, he released his grip and reached for another needle on the other arm. Tian Xing's wife stood beside the physician, watching intently. Nie Yinniang stood quietly next to Mrs. Tian, calmly observing her elder brother. Nie Feng did not take another step forward.
0:33:39|0:33:54|Instead, facing [Nie Yinniang] standing in the distance, his weathered face is filled with worry for his wife. At this moment, in another equally magnificent residence, the candlelight also shines brightly on the gifts. The thin gauze curtain.
0:33:54|0:34:13|Surrounded by layers of curtains swaying in the wind, a woman in plain clothes can be seen inside the room. She looks melancholic, sitting with one hand propping up her chin, as if all the weight of her body is leaning on that arm. This is Hu Ji, the favored concubine of Tian Ji'an. As a wife with no background,
0:34:13|0:34:28|Hu Ji had no power to compete with [Nie Tian Shi] for favor, so she could only wait quietly in her own room. Over time, passing the long waiting hours also became a new pleasure. At this moment, she stared straight ahead at the patterns without looking away.
0:34:28|0:34:35|The eyes had not blinked for a long time, only the left hand unconsciously rubbing the hem of the clothes exposed the inner unrest.
0:34:36|0:34:47|Not until the servant's report did she become alert, hastily sitting up and looking towards the outside of the room. The twisting of her head following the figure outside completely exposed her inner longing and joy.
0:34:47|0:35:2|As the footsteps approached, [Hu Ji] quickly got up to greet the newcomer, and then saw [Tian Ji'an] in a plain silk ceremonial robe, carrying a long sword, walking in with a cold face. He stood in front of the couch, looked around, and threw the long sword onto the couch.
0:35:2|0:35:16|Sitting down, Tian Ji'an swung his robe and rested his feet on the footrest. With his right hand supporting his knee and eyes glaring straight ahead, it seemed like he had some foul words that he hadn't been able to utter yet. [Hu Ji] obediently followed behind him, smiling and nodding towards the maid beside her. Seeing this, the maid...
0:35:16|0:35:30|Immediately, [Jing Jing'er] walked to [Hu Ji] with a tray, from which [Hu Ji] took out a small golden wine flask and held it in front of [Tian Ji'an]. [Tian Ji'an] turned his head, took the flask and held it near his mouth without drinking for a long time. After a while,
0:35:30|0:35:45|He absentmindedly blew on the surface, took a small sip. He held the wine flask in front of him, lost in thought for a long time, before finishing the remaining wine in one gulp. He then impatiently handed the wine flask to [Hu Ji]. [Hu Ji] placed the wine flask back on the tray.
0:35:45|0:35:59|The maid gestured to Tian Ji'an and, seeing him unmoved for a long time, Hu Ji turned around, gently climbed onto Tian Ji'an's shoulder, rested her cheek on his shoulder, and softly spoke.
0:36:1|0:36:12|Hu Ji looked at Tian Ji'an's cheek with a cute tilt of her head, quietly trying to figure out his thoughts. When Tian Ji'an heard these words, the gloom on his face deepened a few shades.
0:36:14|0:36:21|Hu Ji heard this with a hint of surprise, sitting up straight instead of leaning against Tian Ji'an, and looked at him seriously.
0:36:27|0:36:45|Facing this uncle [Tian Ji'an] full of resentment, the old generals did not regard the young military governor with much respect, but instead showed great admiration for [Tian Xing]. Therefore, he could only roar loudly and exile [Tian Xing] to assert his authority. But now, as the overall commander of the Imperial Guards, [Tian Xing] also commands great respect within the army.
0:36:45|0:37:1|It's not something that [Tian Ji'an] can easily handle. [Hu Ji] is even more powerless in this matter, she once again snuggles up to [Tian Ji'an]. However, what they don't know is that at this moment, someone is quietly approaching the outside of the curtain. Standing there watching [Tian Ji'an].
0:37:1|0:37:16|After doting on his concubine for a long time, Tian Ji'an finally lowered his head and placed a delicate embroidered pouch on the table beside him. When he looked up again, his eyes emitted a chilling gaze, and she disregarded it, lifting the veil in front of her and taking a few steps forward.
0:37:16|0:37:32|Facing the embrace of a former childhood sweetheart and a stranger, [Nie Yinniang] couldn't quite explain the feelings in her heart. [Tian Ji'an], still immersed in his own emotions, did not notice [Nie Yinniang]'s presence. It was [Hu Ji] who saw [Nie Yinniang] standing not far away.
0:37:33|0:37:49|[Tian Ji'an] opened his eyes after sensing something wrong with [Hu Ji]. When he saw [Nie Yinniang], he shouted angrily and grabbed his sword, rushing out. The two quickly disappeared in the room, and [Hu Ji] only got up after a long time, looking thoughtfully outside. In the candlelight,
0:37:49|0:38:7|[Nie Yinniang]'s embroidered pouch left behind was particularly eye-catching. [Tian Ji'an] was skilled in martial arts, but [Nie Yinniang] was even better. He raised his sword and lightly flipped over several roof eaves, landing on a slanted roof, while [Nie Yinniang] had long been standing here, quietly watching the people in front of her.
0:38:7|0:38:25|[Tian Ji'an] suddenly raised his sword and struck forward. Faced with [Tian Ji'an]'s attack, [Nie Yinniang] did not fight back, but calmly retreated to avoid it. As [Tian Ji'an]'s move missed, he was instead pushed back, feeling angry. He turned around, raised his sword again, and charged back aggressively, unwilling to show weakness.
0:38:25|0:38:42|[Nie Yinniang], although empty-handed, easily catches [Tian Ji'an]'s moves. This time, she doesn't just defend, but grabs the hand holding the sword of [Tian Ji'an] and punches him, making him step forward several steps. However, [Tian Ji'an] doesn't seem to give up easily, raising his sword again to strike forward.
0:38:42|0:39:1|Nie Yinniang effortlessly stopped Tian Ji'an's move with a casual hand gesture, then kicked him in the chest, causing Tian Ji'an to stagger back several steps. Tian Ji'an then stood up, clutching his chest in pain, still glaring angrily and advancing with his sword. However, Nie Yinniang showed no desire to continue the fight.
0:39:1|0:39:17|She turned around gracefully, leaped off the roof and disappeared. [Tian Ji'an] rubbed his chest, looking somewhat dazed at the figure's back. The assassin's silent arrival, defeat, and departure had been enough to make [Tian Ji'an] tremble with fear. The next moment,
0:39:17|0:39:30|He deployed his troops and sent his trusted general [Xia Jing] to investigate the assassin. [Xia Jing] never delayed in carrying out orders from [Tian Ji'an], and he continued to patrol the streets with his sword in hand. [Xia Jing] carefully observed the streets.
0:39:30|0:39:44|The traces on both sides of the alley suddenly changed their expression and rushed towards the opposite alley with a sword in hand. At this moment, [Hu Ji] in the room was restless, holding the embroidered pouch left by [Nie Yinniang], anxiously glancing at the door from time to time.
0:39:44|0:39:56|[Tian Ji'an] has not returned yet, causing [Hu Ji] to be extremely anxious. Sensing someone entering the door, [Hu Ji] hurriedly rose and walked forward in small steps to greet. Upon seeing [Tian Ji'an] safe and sound,
0:39:56|0:40:14|[Hu Ji] threw herself into his arms, and [Tian Ji'an] embraced her back. Then, with a cold expression, he walked to the table, picked up the scabbard on the bed, inserted the sword into it, and threw it aside. He sat down, flicked his sleeve, and looked around aimlessly. [Hu Ji] sat beside [Tian Ji'an].
0:40:14|0:40:28|Seeing his worried expression, she handed the embroidered pouch and jade pendant to him. [Tian Ji'an] looked at them in disbelief, then after a moment of contemplation, he hurriedly took out a similar jade pendant from his own waist.
0:40:31|0:40:50|[Tian Ji'an] had a rare moment of fleeting regret on his face. After a while, sensing the puzzled look from [Hu Ji], he once again put the two jade pendants together to signal to her.
0:41:0|0:41:18|It seems that every move of that assassin can be explained clearly, for example, she silently sneaked into the mansion just to leave behind this jade pendant. After being chased out by [Tian Ji'an], she clearly had the strength to overpower him but still did not kill. In fact, [Nie Yinniang]'s purpose is very simple,
0:41:18|0:41:37|She just wanted [Tian Ji'an] to recognize her. Only by cutting off her past emotions, can [Nie Yinniang] regain her identity as an assassin. As [Tian Ji'an] reminisced about the past while polishing the jade, [Nie Yinniang] once again silently sneaked into the room.
0:42:12|0:42:16|Tian Ji'an's legal wife, Tian Yuanshi, is the daughter of the governor of Mingzhou, Yuan Yi.
0:42:20|0:42:52|For political reasons, [Tian Xufu and his wife] decided to arrange a marriage between their son [Tian Ji'an] and Miss Yuanying. This decision was hard for [Nie Yinniang], who had been childhood friends with [Young Master Tian] at that time. Thirteen years have passed, and now [Nie Yinniang] calmly listens to [Tian Ji'an] reminiscing about the past.
0:43:2|0:43:9|[Tian Ji'an] seems to be nostalgic, he knows why the former Yao Qi would break into the Yuan family's yard back then.
0:43:14|0:43:25|[Tian Ji'an] remained motionless, as if lost in his own thoughts. At this point, [Nie Yinniang] also understood the meaning behind the princess's words left behind years ago. She first presented the jade pendant to the two of them to symbolize a bond.
0:43:25|0:43:38|After being abandoned for a political marriage, [Nie Yinniang] was given to [Tian Ji'an] instead, and the reckless [Nie Yinniang] was severely injured by the people of the Yuan family. To protect her, the princess had no choice but to take her away.
0:43:40|0:43:55|Hearing about her husband's past with his childhood sweetheart, [Hu Ji] did not feel jealous, but instead felt indignant for [Nie Yinniang]. How could a teenager understand the earth-shattering destiny that awaited her? At this moment, [Hu Ji] herself was unaware of her own fate, and would also be affected by this unintentional defense.
0:43:55|0:44:21|There is a shift in [Tian Ji'an]'s demeanor as he seeks some illusory comfort, he initiatively embraces [Hu Ji] and rests his chin on her shoulder, with [Hu Ji] leaning into his embrace.
0:44:32|0:44:41|[Tian Ji'an] holds [Hu Ji]'s hand, as if trying to find a trace of the past [Nie Yinniang] through her.
0:44:45|0:45:5|With Tian Ji'an's recollection, Nie Yinniang's image becomes clearer, and the long-forgotten moonlight seems to shine again in his heart. These things have been weighing on his heart for many years, thinking that he had already forgotten them, only to realize today that the things engraved in his heart will be remembered for a lifetime. The watchful subordinates,
0:45:5|0:45:19|The ambitious confidante, who has never let Tian Ji'an rest easy for so many years. Only with Hu Ji can he relax for a moment. Nie Yinniang stood in a corner of the inner room, calmly listening to her cousin recounting stories of the past.
0:45:19|0:45:37|Her cold expression seemed to relax. At this moment, [Nie Yinniang] no longer looked at [Tian Ji'an] as if he were prey. Her gaze drifted aimlessly in the air, seemingly immersed in this memory. Perhaps at this moment, even that indomitable command had left a crack in her heart.
0:45:37|0:45:47|At this moment, [Nie Feng] sat on the footrest in the main hall, leaning his head on his hand and sighing silently, then continued to stare blankly. [Mrs. Nie] stood behind him.
0:45:47|0:46:2|Separated from him by only a thin veil, [Nie Feng] serves as the third in command in Weibo and is also the uncle of [Tian Ji'an]. Suddenly, a series of footsteps disrupted his thoughts, and the old steward of the [Nie Residence] slowly walked in.
0:46:5|0:46:11|The old steward turned his head and gave a wink to the side, then walked out with a cane. A dusty soldier walked in.
0:46:22|0:46:29|[Mrs. Nie] could no longer contain the unrest in her heart, she lifted the gauze and walked into the main hall, while [Nie Feng] forced himself to stay alert and waved his hand.
0:46:31|0:46:55|The soldier respectfully bowed to [Nie Feng] and hurried away. [Mrs. Nie] quickly walked a few steps forward and stood in front of [Nie Feng]. [Nie Feng] clenched his teeth and slapped his thigh in frustration. At this moment, both [Mr. and Mrs. Nie] understood who this assassin was. At that time, [Nie Yinniang] had intruded into the Marquis' residence.
0:46:55|0:46:59|Badly injured, if it weren't for the nun taking the princess away,
0:47:6|0:47:21|[Nie Feng] glared at [Nie Tian Shi] with a hint of anger and resentment towards the princess, moving closer to her. Upon hearing his words, [Nie Tian Shi] slowly lifted her head, meeting [Nie Feng]'s gaze directly. Neither of them spoke, only exchanging a silent look.
0:47:21|0:47:37|Nie Feng understood Madam's intentions. After all, this was an order personally issued by the princess, and they were powerless to resist. Suddenly, the old steward stood at the door again, bowing respectfully.
0:47:38|0:47:58|Lady Nie listened to the report and once again met General Nie's gaze. The two looked at each other in silence once again. At this moment, Tian Ji'an hurriedly invited him, but what was his intention? Both of them already knew it in their hearts, and General Nie also had no choice but to enter the mansion because he had to stop his daughter.
0:47:58|0:48:12|At this moment, [Nie Yinniang] has returned to her residence. She quietly enters the room without disturbing the maid who is already asleep on the bed. Obviously, with [Xia Jing]'s skills, [Nie Yinniang] could easily shake him off.
0:48:12|0:48:28|However, even when she returned to her own home, [Nie Yinniang] showed no warmth in her eyes. She stood still in the center of the room, furrowing her brows as if listening to the sounds outside. Perhaps every word of the conversation between [Nie Tian Shi] and his wife had fallen perfectly into [Nie Yinniang]'s ears.
0:48:28|0:48:47|At five o'clock in the morning, the drum sounded, and [Tian Ji'an] was already waiting in the hall. The disturbance of the assassin kept him awake all night, his face looking very unpleasant. Soon, [Nie Feng] arrived, and [Xia Jing] greeted him at the door, respectfully leading him to [Tian Ji'an].
0:49:8|0:49:16|After receiving the token, [Tian Ji'an] flicked his sleeve and cast a scrutinizing glance at [Nie Feng]. [Nie Feng] paid no attention to the token handed to him by [Xia Jing], maintaining his composure.
0:49:22|0:49:32|[Xia Jing] hesitated upon hearing this and withdrew his hand. Upon receiving the answer, [Nie Feng] immediately reached out his hand. Seeing this, [Xia Jing] placed the token into his hand.
0:49:36|0:49:43|[Nie Feng] took the token and turned to leave, [Tian Ji'an] spoke again, a look of surprise on [Nie Feng]'s face as he turned back to look at him.
0:49:53|0:50:8|Let [Tian Ji'an] no longer disguise himself with a high and aloof expression, keeping strangers at a distance. Holding a command token in one hand and a sword in the other, [Nie Feng] walked confidently up to [Tian Ji'an].
0:50:10|0:50:20|[Tian Ji'an] knew that his uncle was reminding him, and at the thought of this, a hint of indescribable smile appeared on [Tian Ji'an]'s face. He then got up and took a few steps forward, smiling at [Nie Feng]. As clever as [Nie Feng],
0:50:22|0:50:36|Tian Ji'an immediately understood the meaning behind the words, he looked up and scrutinized his nephew for a long time, then arched his hand and walked away without looking back, while Xia Jing's gaze followed Nie Feng's figure until Nie Feng walked out of the main hall.
0:50:36|0:50:50|Having just bowed to [Tian Ji'an], she followed them out. [Tian Ji'an] calmly turned his head to see them off, revealing a mysterious expression. He trusted his brother-in-law's abilities, but this matter was beyond his control. At this moment,
0:50:50|0:51:5|[Tian Xing] did not rest either. She sat in front of the dressing table with exquisite makeup. Her maid picked up a palm-sized flower-shaped hairpin and carefully inserted it into her high bun. As the maid moved, [Tian Xing] blinked slightly.
0:51:5|0:51:34|The expression remained unchanged. Suddenly, a loud bang of the door broke the calmness in the room. [Tian Xing] heard the sound and slightly lowered her eyes, as if she had anticipated the arrival of the person. A sly-looking man then bowed respectfully and stood in front of [Tian Xing], who was none other than her confidant, Jiang Shize.
0:51:35|0:51:56|Upon hearing the report, [Tian Xing]'s expression became somewhat subtle. She involuntarily straightened her body and tilted her head slightly upwards, while Jiang Shi wore a worried expression, clearly avoiding a direct confrontation with [Tian Ji'an], and finally hid behind the screen. With that, she picked up the small mirror on the table and started to look at herself as if no one else was present.
0:51:56|0:52:13|From time to time, she adjusted her hairpin without paying any attention to Tian Ji'an. Tian Ji'an walked straight to sit beside Tian Xing, staring at the screen in front of him. Tian Ji'an calmly looked ahead, still maintaining a poker face.
0:52:39|0:52:56|[Tian Ji'an] disdainfully locked eyes with her. After speaking, [Tian Ji'an] looked back at the bronze mirror. [Tian Ji'an] got up and walked towards the outside of the room. Hearing this,
0:52:57|0:53:6|[Tian Ji'an] raised the corners of his mouth, revealing a half-true, half-fake smile. However, as soon as [Tian Ji'an] completely left, he immediately restrained his expression.
0:53:6|0:53:23|The eyes revealed an unprecedented chill, while Jiang Shi still stood there nodding obediently. The two maids seemed as if nothing had happened, carrying a tray with head ornaments to [Tian Ji'an], carefully adorning her once again. During the rebellion in Zhaoyi Town years ago,
0:53:23|0:53:44|General Yuan Yi's rebellion against the court failed, leading him to flee to Weibo with 5000 elite soldiers and over ten thousand family members. At that time, [Tian Xing] was overjoyed, not only accepting the Yuan family but also arranging for his heir [Tian Ji'an] to marry Yuan Yi's daughter, forming a close relationship between the two families. Little did he know that he was actually inviting a wolf into his home. Now, apart from the court,
0:53:44|0:54:4|The foreign faction led by Jiang Shize is a formidable enemy of [Tian Ji'an]. The burying alive of Qiujiang. [Tian Ji'an] knows what the Yuan family has done but has no further information, but times have changed. Will [Tian Xing]'s life and death still be controlled by the Yuan family? The next day, [Tian Ji'an] walked with [Xia Jing] in a corridor.
0:54:4|0:54:21|[Tian Ji'an] and [Xia Jing] did not pause for a moment, walking straight ahead. However, after reaching the next corner, [Tian Ji'an] suddenly stopped, followed closely by [Xia Jing]. He stood on the corridor for a long time, imagining the secluded place.
0:54:22|0:54:39|He was sure Yiao Qi could see him. In fact, compared to Tian Yuan Shi's pervasive surveillance of the Tian family and her hidden agenda, simply wanting to get rid of Nie Yinniang himself was more to Tian Ji'an's taste. But neither faction was something he could shake.
0:54:39|0:54:55|At this point, [Tian Ji'an]'s face darkened even more, striding forward with determination. Meanwhile, the outdoor scene was quite different. The cloud-like mist lingered in the air, making it difficult to breathe. At the foot of the mountain,
0:54:55|0:55:13|It was the farewell ceremony for [Tian Xing]. [Nie Feng] and [Tian Xing] had already raised their wine glasses to their wives, and then the two wives stepped forward together. They held the wine glasses in their left hands, dipped a few drops of wine with their right hands and flicked them into the air, then dipped a few more drops and sprinkled them on the ground.
0:55:13|0:55:21|Then she raised her hands holding the wine cup and spilled some wine in front of herself. Finally, [Nie Tian Shi] turned around to face her elder brother [Tian Xing].
0:55:24|0:55:38|[Tian Xing] remained silent, nodding slightly at [Mrs. Nie], then turned his gaze to his own wife and children. Finally, he raised his glass, finished the remaining wine in one gulp. When the wine is gone, all formalities are meaningless no matter what is said.
0:55:38|0:55:47|[Tian Xing] placed the wine glass on the tray held up by the attendant, frowned and looked around, with a hint of nostalgia in his eyes. Soon,
0:55:47|0:56:4|A group of people set off on the journey, with a total of 9 people including Tian Xing and Nie Feng. Nie Tian Shi, Tian Xing's wife, and their servants stood quietly under the tree, watching the few people leave. This was destined to be a challenging and uncomfortable journey. Tian Ji'an was not foolish.
0:56:4|0:56:17|He accurately identified that [Tian Xing] was feigning illness and promptly demoted him, while [Tian Ji'an] specifically went to [Tian Tian Shi]'s room to hint at [Tian Xing]'s exile, possibly with the intention of using another's hand to kill. But at the same time,
0:56:17|0:56:37|He dispatched [Nie Feng] to escort him under the pretext of the burial ritual three years ago. Now that [Nie Yinniang] has returned home, she naturally will not allow her father to encounter danger on the way. At this moment, the three-tiered candlestick in the room is lit with six or seven candles, emitting a strange light through the black gauze. In the center of the room sits an old man with a bald head and a thick beard.
0:56:37|0:57:0|He dipped his hands into the paint on the table, as if painting something. The old man looked up and gave an instruction before returning to his own task. [Jiang Shizhe] stood motionless behind the black veil, only approaching the old man after the attendant left the room.
0:57:1|0:57:15|Before [Jiang Shize] could finish speaking, the old man immediately raised his index finger and made a gesture for silence. He first looked up at the door, then continued to bow his head and busy himself with what was in his hands.
0:57:15|0:57:31|[Jiang Shize]'s face showed a hint of confusion. Following the old man's gaze, he hesitated before turning his eyes back to the old man. Suddenly, the door was pushed open, and the previous attendant walked in, followed by five or six men in black.
0:57:31|0:57:55|After everyone entered the room, [Tian Ji'an] hurriedly greeted them. It seemed that [Tian Ji'an] said a few more words, and the man in the lead simply nodded. Then [Tian Ji'an] waved his hand, and the man in the lead led the others out of the room, carefully closing the door before leaving.
0:57:55|0:58:4|The old man here is Master Kong Kong'er, the mentor of [Jing Jing'er]. The sky quickly darkened, and it was already the hour of the tiger. Suddenly,
0:58:4|0:58:18|In the woods, three or four torches were lit and moving rapidly. It could be seen that this was a small team of five or six people from the previous tribe, galloping non-stop on the road. Upon seeing the torches, everyone immediately held the reins.
0:58:21|0:58:40|Arriving late at night only to find it empty-handed, the leading man seemed somewhat frustrated. Without any hesitation, he immediately pulled the reins and rushed forward, with everyone following closely behind. Before long, they arrived at the hour of the Rabbit. A figure in black stood in the middle of the road, holding a horse, clearly waiting for them for quite some time.
0:58:50|0:59:10|The leading man pondered for a moment and then immediately gave orders. He pointed to the two people on his right to chase after the side road, while he led the others to continue on the main road. Before long, the sun hung high in the sky, casting dappled shadows on the path through the dense forest.
0:59:10|0:59:28|The two individuals who were previously assigned to chase towards the fork in the road, drove their horses through the dense forest. After an unknown amount of time, they were still traveling through the narrow and secluded path. The round-faced man at the front was the first to sense something amiss. He held the reins, drew his sword, and vigilantly scanned the surroundings.
0:59:28|0:59:43|The thin tall man behind had not reacted yet, and was cut down by several bailiffs rushing out of the dense forest. [Tian Xing] emerged from the woods with a fierce look on his face. Before the bailiffs could surround him again, a long arrow came flying.
0:59:43|1:0:0|The bailiff shot through, and the previous group of people rushed over. [Tian Xing] was furious and charged forward with his long sword. The round-faced man behind him threw out a chain, accurately tripping his leg and slamming him hard in front of everyone.
1:0:0|1:0:18|Near a small waterfall not far away, a young boy squats on a rock, submerging a bamboo tube in the water. After a while, when the tube is filled with water, he takes it out, firmly closes the lid, and walks towards a bookcase behind him. The boy carefully hangs the bamboo tube on the bookcase and is about to leave.
1:0:18|1:0:38|Unexpectedly, the sound around attracted her attention. At this moment, [Nie Feng] had already been subdued by the men in black. His hands were tied behind his back, and a person next to him was recklessly pressing a sharp sword against his neck. Two other people were vigorously filling a pit in front of [Nie Feng], while [Tian Xing] inside the pit was struggling restlessly with his hands tied.
1:0:38|1:0:54|At this moment, the young man in front of the waterfall stealthily lurked in the woods with a wooden stick in his hand. Suddenly, he crouched down and swiftly rushed towards the edge of the pit, first knocking down a man in black, and then swinging the stick to knock down another person. Seeing this, the two men in black who were filling the pit picked up their knives and lunged towards the young man.
1:0:56|1:1:10|[Nie Feng] stood still from beginning to end, with no change in expression. Instead of fighting, he agilely dodged around the trees to escape. Two black-clad figures chased closely behind, realizing that the young man's skills were not exceptional.
1:1:10|1:1:24|The only way to buy time was through some small actions. The boy stumbled and at the same time grabbed a vine by the tree, looped it around the black-clothed person, who was too busy wielding his weapon to notice, and ended up falling flat on his face.
1:1:24|1:1:40|Just as the outcome was still uncertain, a spirited horse appeared in the jungle. [Nie Yinniang] dismounted and walked towards [Mirror-polishing Boy] at a leisurely pace, finding it all too easy to deal with these black-clad men.
1:1:40|1:1:55|[Mirror-polishing Boy] turned back again, circling around the edge of the kang quietly, lurking past, then suddenly stood up and swung his stick. However, the black-clad figure here was well-prepared, constantly dodging his attacks and even striking back with a sword.
1:1:55|1:2:2|The boy, failing to land a blow, panicked and ran to the tree, only to be impaled by the sword of the black-clad figure and pinned to the tree.
1:2:3|1:2:19|Another black-clad figure was about to strike with his knife, but was blocked by [Nie Yinniang] descending from above. Suddenly they closed in on her, but [Nie Yinniang] fearlessly stepped forward and wielded her dagger. In just one exchange, three of them were simultaneously stabbed in the neck.
1:2:19|1:2:34|When [Nie Yinniang] turned around again, the three of them were already lying dead on the ground. Even General [Nie Feng], who had experienced many storms, was shocked by his daughter's decisive and swift skills. By now, it was already afternoon, but the sky was dark and gloomy.
1:2:34|1:2:49|The escort team for [Tian Xing] set off again, with [Nie Yinniang] leading a mule at the front. Following her were the young man who had just helped out and the elderly man accompanying him. The young man often wore a bronze mirror on his chest, a master of magic mirrors.
1:2:49|1:3:5|The old man is a herbalist. The young man's ancestors were builders from the Kingdom of Siam, who came to Japan to construct the Horyu-ji Temple and have since resided in Japan for over 200 years. Three years ago, his father was honored to be selected as a builder on the ship to Tang Dynasty.
1:3:5|1:3:20|Unexpectedly encountering a storm and getting injured on the way back, he came to the Tang Dynasty in place of his father, only to encounter another storm. In a moment of danger, the boy was luckily saved by an old man collecting herbs, and has been by the old man's side for three years to repay the debt of saving his life.
1:3:20|1:3:41|The old man usually travels far and wide to collect medicinal herbs, some of which grow in uninhabited areas and vary by season, so he relies on villagers to help collect them. Afterwards, he will make them into pills to repay the villagers. [Nie Yinniang] hired a few villagers from somewhere, and they carefully carried [Nie Feng] in a bamboo basket with him closely following them. Along the way...
1:3:41|1:3:57|They came across a cliff with a huge natural cave below. The cave was pitch black, with no visibility. The person in front calmly lit a torch and slowly moved forward by the flickering light, gradually,
1:3:57|1:4:16|In the distance, a faint light appeared, and they finally saw the way out. The group did not extinguish the torches, and continued to walk forward calmly. This was obviously not the usual official road. Inside the cave, the old man collecting herbs took the lead, leading everyone into this completely unfamiliar path for the others.
1:4:16|1:4:23|[Nie Yinniang], as a top assassin, naturally wouldn't entrust her back to anyone. However
1:4:23|1:4:38|This time she could follow the old man into this path, showing obvious trust in him. After an unknown period of time, the sky was no longer as dazzling as before. The group walked in a familiar reed marsh, their steps also seemed exhausted.
1:4:38|1:4:56|At this moment, the woodcutter with his two young sons walked along a country path, and happened to come across [Nie Yinniang] and her group. The woodcutter quietly moved to the side, making way for their procession. The previously quiet scene suddenly came to life with the arrival of these few individuals. The next moment...
1:4:56|1:5:13|They arrived at a village where the houses were built with mud walls and thatched roofs. Simple fences were made by twisting thin branches crookedly. Chopped firewood was neatly stacked against the walls, filling the air with the smell of smoke and fire.
1:5:13|1:5:25|A mother stood in the corner watching her young son happily playing with a stick. As she passed by [Nie Yinniang], she just glanced at her subconsciously and then continued playing with her son.
1:5:25|1:5:42|The hired villagers have already tied the horses together with [Nie Yinniang]'s mule to the fence, taking care of them very carefully. The skill of [Mirror-polishing Boy] in the village has been put to good use, as he sits on a low stool and spreads a cloth on a small stool in front of him.
1:5:42|1:5:57|A mirror that had been polished to a shine lay on the cloth. He crumpled a clean cloth into a ball, carefully wiped away the dust on the mirror, and showed it around, causing everyone to burst into laughter at their reflections in the mirror.
1:5:57|1:6:18|The boy hung the mirror on a pillar and took out a brush to polish it. The interior of the room at this moment was completely different. In the dim space, there was only a small window less than half a meter, resembling a cage. In the middle of the room, a very rudimentary stove made of mud was built, and [Nie Yinniang] placed a sand pot next to the stove.
1:6:18|1:6:34|The herbs being brewed inside are for [Nie Feng]'s healing. She sat quietly on the side, watching the flames rising from the stove. Meanwhile, [Nie Feng] was already in a corner not far away, remaining silent with no change in expression. [Nie Yinniang] waited until the fire was almost ready,
1:6:34|1:6:48|Nie Yinniang picked up a piece of cloth and padded it on the handle of the sand pot, pouring the already fried medicinal soup into a bowl next to it. Then, she walked towards Nie Feng while holding the bowl. Nie Yinniang knelt down in front of Nie Feng.
1:6:48|1:7:8|The bowl of medicine in her hand was blown at the mouth until it was at the right temperature before being handed to [Nie Feng]. He looked at his daughter with a hint of surprise, leaned over to the bowl, and sipped the soup medicine with difficulty. [Nie Yinniang] showed no signs of impatience, although her expression remained cold, her actions were meticulous.
1:7:8|1:7:17|[Nie Feng] took a few sips of medicine, then fixed his gaze on [Nie Yinniang]. He paused briefly, took another sip, and then remained still.
1:7:23|1:7:38|As a father who is not good with words, this sentence has already conveyed all of [Nie Feng]'s feelings towards his daughter. When saying this sentence, [Nie Feng] must have summoned great courage, yet still couldn't bring himself to look [Nie Yinniang] in the eye. And [Nie Yinniang], looking at [Nie Feng] in front of her, remained silent.
1:7:38|1:7:56|After a long while, [Nie Feng] finally couldn't hold back and cautiously lifted his head to look at his daughter's face. However, [Nie Yinniang] immediately lowered her head to avoid her father's gaze, got up and sat down next to the stove, while the sobbing breath silently conveyed her current feelings to [Nie Feng].
1:7:56|1:8:2|Obviously she still harbors resentment. After many years, the first conversation between father and daughter ended in this way.
1:8:3|1:8:20|From the moment [Nie Yinniang] decided to abandon her mission and escort her father with [Tian Xing], she was no longer just a cold-blooded killer who followed orders, but became a person with thoughts. In the dimly lit early morning sky, under the faint moonlight, the scenery in front of her could be vaguely distinguished.
1:8:20|1:8:41|Not knowing how long had passed, the thin mist on the water dispersed, replaced by a drizzle. Suddenly, a pebble was thrown into the lake, creating ripples. Then countless birds on the dead branches of the island were startled and flapped their wings, flying away into the distance. Before long, another pebble was thrown into the water.
1:8:41|1:9:0|After touching the surface of the water at its bottom, it soared into the air and flew a short distance before landing in the water. The color of the sky faded as the bird flew away, and the hazy mountains appeared. Soon, the bird turned into a tiny black dot, disappearing into nature. At this moment,
1:9:0|1:9:16|[Nie Yinniang] and her companions settled in a quiet village, where only wisps of smoke rising from the houses silently indicated the presence of remaining inhabitants. Behind the village lay a dense forest, shrouded in morning mist, obscuring its full appearance.
1:9:16|1:9:31|In front of every house, there was an irregular vegetable garden, simple and tranquil. The charcoal in the house burned vigorously, with flames flickering, and the smoke drifted out through the window. In the reflection of the charcoal fire, the interior of the house could be clearly seen.
1:9:31|1:9:46|[Mirror-polishing Boy] lay on a grass mat in the corner, his face illuminated by the flickering flames, sleeping soundly. However, this tranquility was soon shattered as an unknown cry in the distance startled him awake, causing him to shiver.
1:9:46|1:10:7|Opening his eyes, Tian Ji'an found his vision clear. He struggled to sit up and looked towards the door for a while, but drowsiness overcame him once again, and he lay back on the grass mat. Suddenly, he sat up again, leaning against the wall and let out a sigh. It seemed like he remembered something, a hint of a smile appeared on his face, and then he shrugged off his outer robe.
1:10:7|1:10:29|Rising from his seat, he moved towards the stove to check on the charcoal fire. Above the stove was a rack with a pot hanging on it for boiling water. The boy avoided the pot, picked up some dry firewood, and started to fiddle with the charcoal. Then he picked up a hollow tube about the thickness of an arm from the side, gently blowing air towards the firewood. After a few blows, sparks flickered and several sparks jumped out.
1:10:29|1:10:49|At this moment, [Nie Feng] was still sound asleep, lying on his side on the couch, with a pillow made of licorice under his head and a thick blanket covering him. Soon after, the door creaked as someone had already left, but it still didn't wake up the deeply sleeping [Nie Feng]. The Mirror-polishing Boy was dressed neatly, holding a wooden stick in his hand.
1:10:49|1:11:4|Standing in a field overgrown with weeds, constantly looking around as if searching for something. The sky was just beginning to brighten slightly, but still remained gloomy, with the weeds in the field growing up to half a meter high, making the young boy in the middle appear particularly small.
1:11:4|1:11:20|The boy completely disregarded the hurried surroundings and ran forward. Time quickly passed, and now the sun was high in the sky, casting a warm glow everywhere. [Nie Yinniang], on the other hand, walked through a grove with a cold expression, her eyes subtly shifting.
1:11:20|1:11:37|Her gaze constantly observes the surroundings. [Nie Yinniang] clenches her left hand into a fist, while holding a curved dagger in her right hand. On the other side, a person dismounts from the horse, it is the assassin [Jing Jing'er] wearing a golden mask. She wields a curved blade that is half an arm's length.
1:11:37|1:11:43|Walking cautiously while looking around vigilantly, she raised the dagger in her hand slightly, assuming a simple defensive posture.
1:11:44|1:12:3|After a long time without finding her target, her steps gradually slowed down. The face under the mask was as cold as frost, but her eyes revealed a hint of nervousness and guilt. Finally, she stopped and looked around, then as if relieved, she slowly lowered the hand holding the dagger.
1:12:3|1:12:25|The birch forest is now completely bare, looking up from below, the dark branches densely cover the entire sky. As time passes, the clouds in the sky keep rolling and changing. With the gentle breeze, the treetops of the birch trees sway slightly, as if a great battle is about to break out. The masters are about to clash, just a hair's breadth away.
1:12:25|1:12:39|Nie Yinniang nodded slightly, cautiously glancing at Jing Jing'er to her right. Every step she took was extremely careful, like a hawk searching for the perfect moment to strike. Suddenly, Jing Jing'er made the first move.
1:12:39|1:12:57|She came with a horizontal slash, as [Nie Yinniang] dodged and tried to retreat, she predictably reached out her left hand to grab [Nie Yinniang], then the dagger came back with a reverse slash. [Nie Yinniang] used her dagger to block the curved blade and was forced to retreat several steps, [Jing Jing'er]'s weapon was twice as long as [Nie Yinniang]'s, gaining the advantage.
1:12:57|1:13:13|Her every move showed no mercy. However, [Nie Yinniang] countered each move with equal skill, making it difficult to determine a clear winner. Suddenly, [Jing Jing'er] struck [Nie Yinniang]'s dagger aside and slashed towards her with a horizontal blade. In that instant, [Nie Yinniang] adjusted her sword stance accordingly.
1:13:13|1:13:31|With a backhand strike to [Jing Jing'er]'s cheek, [Jing Jing'er] then holds a knife in her right hand, with her back to [Nie Yinniang]. The bright cloak moves on its own without wind, and when [Jing Jing'er] turns back around, a fine crack appears from top to bottom on the golden mask on her face. She pays no attention to the change in the mask.
1:13:31|1:13:42|Instead, he stopped and looked at [Nie Yinniang]. The mask fell off with a sound, the two looked at each other in silence, and finally [Jing Jing'er] took the first step, brushed past [Nie Yinniang], and walked away directly.
1:13:42|1:13:53|[Nie Yinniang] nodded slightly in the direction [Jing Jing'er] left, then walked away without any hesitation. Under the mask was a familiar face - [Tian Ji'an].
1:13:53|1:14:8|[Tian Ji'an] believes that [Nie Yinniang] is his greatest threat, so he decides to take action to defeat her. However, [Nie Yinniang] skillfully splits [Tian Ji'an]'s mask without harming him at all, revealing the outcome of their duel. In [Nie Yinniang]'s eyes,
1:14:8|1:14:24|The concept of protecting Tian Ji'an and protecting the family by Lady Tian Yuan is not contradictory, and Lady Tian Yuan has also understood Nie Yinniang's inner thoughts. At this moment, the two masters instantly understand each other, and Nie Yinniang walks back to the village on the original route.
1:14:24|1:14:40|As she crossed the wilderness, her right hand seemed less agile than before, but she appeared completely unconcerned. [Mirror-polishing Boy] followed behind her at a considerable distance. Suddenly, [Nie Yinniang] paused in her steps.
1:14:40|1:15:2|The boy's already slow pace became even slower, hesitating for a moment thinking that [Nie Yinniang] was waiting for him. He ran forward in big strides, but before he could take a few steps, he saw [Nie Yinniang] holding his right arm and continuing to walk. The boy was unsure of Nie Yinniang's intentions, so he slowed down and stood still for a while, ultimately unable to resist following her from behind.
1:15:2|1:15:27|[Nie Yinniang] continued walking forward without looking back, holding her arm. Suddenly, she stopped again and stood still, which puzzled the boy. He immediately went around to her and checked the injury on her right shoulder. Perhaps [Nie Yinniang] had never been cared for like this before. She lowered her head and quickened her pace, moving forward. The boy hesitated, raised his hand to stop her, but in the end, he let her go.
1:15:27|1:15:41|Upon returning to the room, [Nie Yinniang] exposed the injured right half of her shoulder, allowing [Mirror-polishing Boy] to treat her wound. Her usually restrained face involuntarily showed a pained expression. [Mirror-polishing Boy] sat behind her,
1:15:41|1:15:50|Methodically, [Tian Ji'an] cleaned her wound and then opened the lid of the golden sore medicine, pinching a small amount of powder and gently sprinkling it on her wound.
1:15:50|1:16:6|As the medicine powder continued to soak in, [Nie Yinniang]'s brows furrowed even tighter. Although she made no sound, her body's constant movements revealed the unbearable pain she was enduring. Yet at this moment, it was not just physical pain, but more so psychological.
1:16:6|1:16:19|She lowered her head and looked quietly at the ground, with a hint of grievance and sadness between her eyebrows. And all of this took place in Nie Feng's room, where Nie Feng was still leaning against the wall with half a thin blanket draped over him.
1:16:19|1:16:58|He silently watched all this, without saying a word. As a father, he never knew what his daughter had been through all these years, only knowing that it couldn't have been good. When Nie Yinniang spoke, Nie Feng couldn't help but hold his breath and sit up straight almost imperceptibly, silently and wordlessly gazing at her. After hearing this sentence,
1:17:0|1:17:8|[Nie Yinniang] seems to be unable to control her emotions. Her eyebrows are tightly furrowed, her chin is trembling slightly, and her eyes are lonely and lifeless.
1:17:8|1:17:23|The green cherry blossoms dance in the mirror, speaking not only of Princess Jiacheng, but also of herself. Thinking of this, [Nie Yinniang] self-mockingly curls up the corners of her mouth, a fleeting forced smile. What follows is a surge of overwhelming loneliness and heartache.
1:17:23|1:17:39|Mirror-polishing Boy, although not fully understanding what Nie Yinniang was saying, could clearly feel the sadness emanating from her core. After hesitating for a moment, he gently placed his hand on Nie Yinniang's bare shoulder, comforting her. At that moment, Nie Yinniang realized
1:17:39|1:18:0|The man had completely understood her. She closed her eyes tightly, tears shimmering at the corners. Unbeknownst to her, [Nie Feng] had already averted his gaze, his head tilted with his line of sight lowered, still maintaining a poker face. However, a tear had been hidden in his eyes for a while, faintly shimmering in the candlelight.
1:18:0|1:18:12|[Mirror-polishing Boy] paid no attention to the cryptic way the father and daughter communicated. He covered the ointment jar and neatly packed the rest of his tools into his box. All he needed to understand was,
1:18:12|1:18:27|Having genuine feelings for [Nie Yinniang] is enough. The now composed [Nie Yinniang], after venting out her emotions, has completely restrained herself. As an assassin, she carries a countless number of hidden weapons on her. In the dim candlelight,
1:18:27|1:18:47|One could barely see her constantly stuffing small items into her waist, tucking them into pockets and fastening sleeves. Then she took a leather belt from the shelf and buckled it around her waist. At this moment, the main hall of the Prefectural Governor's residence was filled with a lively scene of singing and dancing. This banquet was hosted by [Tian Ji'an] to entertain loyal courtiers.
1:18:47|1:19:6|Grand and luxurious. Seven or eight dancing girls gathered in the center, dressed in gorgeous and flowing outfits, elegantly swaying their bodies. [Tian Ji'an] sat cross-legged in the main seat in a magnificent official robe, squinting his eyes, intoxicatedly tapping the drum in his cup to the rhythm of the music. His second son was also brought to the main hall.
1:19:6|1:19:25|Sitting beside him, the second son didn't quite understand the scene in front of him. He looked at the dancer and then turned to look at [Tian Ji'an]. To the right of the main seat was a group of four drummers, three women and one man. On the right side of the main hall were several men dressed in cold-colored clothing, savoring the food in front of them. They were sitting opposite to him.
1:19:25|1:19:31|It was a group of men in colorful attire, holding wine glasses and chatting happily, with clear distinctions between the two sides.
1:19:31|1:19:47|[Tian Ji'an] paid no attention to the surging undercurrent below the stage. He casually drummed on the drum, his gaze never leaving the dancing girl in front of him, who was none other than [Hu Ji]. [Hu Ji] stood in the center, smiling coquettishly as she raised her hand to look at [Tian Ji'an].
1:19:47|1:20:2|Her leg lifted slightly, silently displaying her soft and graceful posture. Then, with seductive eyes, she tiptoed forward in small steps, extending her boneless grace towards [Tian Ji'an]. Obviously, [Tian Ji'an] was quite taken with her charm.
1:20:2|1:20:18|He set the drum aside and immediately walked towards [Hu Ji]. [Tian Ji'an] had his back to [Hu Ji], kneeling on one knee. He turned his head, exchanged a knowing smile with her, and they started dancing gracefully to the music, filling the scene with joy and liveliness.
1:20:18|1:20:34|[Tian Ji'an] stopped jumping shortly after. He circled around [Hu Ji] by her side, gazing at her without blinking, and then gave a meaningful smile. He reached out his hand and embraced [Hu Ji]'s slender waist, and [Hu Ji] fell into his arms.
1:20:34|1:20:55|Laughter filled the room. In stark contrast to the lively atmosphere in the main hall, this room was very quiet, with only three candles on the table emitting a faint light. At this moment, a pair of old and powerful hands were placed on the table, tearing a piece of white paper about the size of two palms, vaguely resembling a human figure. Viewing from a distance,
1:20:55|1:21:13|It can be clearly judged that this person is Jing Jing'er. Although these actions seem simple, Jing Jing'er is full of caution. After tearing it, he casually pushed the other paper scraps on the table to one side, and slowly laid the paper figure on the table. Then he pressed down with his right hand.
1:21:13|1:21:29|With his left middle finger dipped in the liquid from the silver bowl, he touched the paper figure's legs, then picked up some pigment from the inkstone and applied it to the figure's limbs. He then picked up the paper figure, glanced at it, threw it into the nearby water tank, and started chanting an incantation.
1:21:32|1:21:57|With Jing Jing'er chanting softly, the paper figure sank to the bottom of the vat and unexpectedly took on a standing posture. Subsequently, the paper continuously tilted downwards, causing the colors printed on it to seep out and slowly dissolve in the water. Even more eerie was that the paper eventually disappeared into the water vat, completely vanishing without a trace.
1:21:57|1:22:12|The previously dissolved pigments were also nowhere to be found, as if there had never been anything in the first place. Outside the mansion, the patrol team of three, holding torches, vigilantly surveyed the surroundings. Along the corridor, a fire basin was set up every few meters for illumination.
1:22:12|1:22:33|The eaves are also hung with neatly arranged lanterns. However, the illumination of the candlelight is always limited, just slightly brightening the long corridor. Not far away, the pavilion is pitch black, exuding an eerie atmosphere. Vaguely visible on the edge of the pavilion is a well cover placed on the well opening, with a thick and invisible fluid seeping out from the cracks, winding along the ground.
1:22:33|1:22:45|In a small grove, the light was blocked by the dense branches, casting a dark shadow. The soldiers were busy patrolling around the houses, unaware of the lurking danger here. Following the direction of the patrol team, [Tian Ji'an] looked ahead.
1:22:45|1:23:6|Only a few white peonies could be seen in a corner of the woods. At this moment, the other side that was previously facing it was completely empty, not even a lantern was lit. Not far from the pavilion, only a few torches were burning, barely providing some light to the surroundings. It seemed as if a shadow was swaying and drifting under the foundation of the corridor.
1:23:6|1:23:21|He moved silently, calmly approaching his target. This corridor was a must-pass for [Hu Ji], and the paper figure cut by Jing Jing'er only had [Hu Ji]'s birth date and time. [Hu Ji] was pregnant.
1:23:21|1:23:41|She was afraid that Lady Yuanshi would harm her child, so she used chicken blood to fake her menstrual cycle, even [Tian Ji'an] was not informed. It can be seen that she is a clever person who understands the intricate relationships within the mansion. However, despite her efforts to conceal it, the all-pervasive Yuanshi family easily discovered this secret. Although the main characters of the Green Beryl Dance Mirror are Princess Jiacheng and
1:23:41|1:23:54|[Nie Yinniang], but [Hu Ji] is also another green luan. She is alone in the palace, struggling to survive, and now she may not even be able to protect her child. At this moment, [Hu Ji]'s performance has ended.
1:23:54|1:24:8|She led the group of dancing girls out of the main hall, playfully arriving in the corridor. An elderly maid holding a lantern hurriedly walked in the front. [Hu Ji] was excitedly talking to the woman in the middle of the light, occasionally waving her sleeves and spinning around.
1:24:8|1:24:29|Even the usually reserved [Hu Ji] was smiling as she looked at the woman. Soon they stepped onto the corridor, where the lanterns on the top were all lit up, and there were neatly arranged candlesticks for illumination. The maid sent them to the corridor and then turned back. The dancers were still frolicking and chasing each other in the brilliant light of the candles.
1:24:29|1:24:49|[Hu Ji] was originally smiling while watching the dancers play, but suddenly felt very uncomfortable, and her smile gradually faded. She lifted her skirt and involuntarily covered her nose, furrowing her brows. At this moment, a faint wisp of smoke slowly rose near the pillar. Before long, [Hu Ji] could no longer stand on her own.
1:24:49|1:25:8|She walked unsteadily to the pillar, leaning against it and breathing lightly. Unaware that the smoke was getting thicker, she leisurely spun around the pillar and then headed straight towards [Hu Ji]. The spell of emptiness had taken effect. At that moment, the old maid and the dancers who noticed something was wrong with [Hu Ji],
1:25:8|1:25:17|Having just searched from both ends of the corridor, [Hu Ji] was trembling and leaning against a pillar, enveloped in a cloud of smoke. The dancers had already scattered in fear.
1:25:17|1:25:29|Only [Nie Yinniang] quickly stepped forward, and with a wave of her hand, the smoke made a strange sound before disappearing without a trace. By this time, [Hu Ji] had already fainted from exhaustion.
1:25:29|1:25:44|Tian Ji'an and Xia Jing, who arrived late, rushed up the corridor. The moment they saw Nie Yinniang, they drew their swords and attacked. Nie Yinniang did not fight back, only dodged the attack. Tian Ji'an did not linger either, quickly rushing forward to help Hu Ji, who was lying on the ground.
1:25:46|1:25:58|[Xia Jing] rushed up to fight fiercely with [Nie Yinniang], while only [Tian Ji'an] looked worried, holding [Hu Ji] from behind. Suddenly, [Hu Ji] seemed to wake up from a dream, opened her eyes wide, and couldn't help but gasp.
1:25:59|1:26:3|The maids and serving girls hurried forward to support [Tian Ji'an] as they helped [Hu Ji].
1:26:4|1:26:19|[Tian Ji'an] raised the sword beside him and charged down the corridor towards [Nie Yinniang]. [Nie Yinniang] agilely dodged backwards, at the same time knocking [Xia Jing]'s weapon out of his hand. With another swift move, her dagger was already at [Tian Ji'an]'s throat. [Tian Ji'an]'s fist clenched tighter and tighter.
1:26:23|1:26:36|[Nie Yinniang] never lifted her head to meet [Tian Ji'an]'s intense gaze. She stared at [Tian Ji'an]'s collar, dropped these words, then sheathed her dagger and turned to leave. [Xia Jing] had already restrained himself and was ready to rush up with the guards.
1:26:36|1:26:50|Tian Ji'an reached out to stop Xia Jing. Xia Jing immediately stopped, looking at Tian Ji'an with a hint of confusion. Tian Ji'an stared in the direction Nie Yinniang had left for a long time without saying a word, and the matter was settled like this. It was late at night, and the corridor was empty.
1:26:50|1:26:58|Only the candlestick stood alone in the corner of the corridor, with the flames flickering as it burned, emitting puffs of smoke. At this moment
1:26:58|1:27:21|[Xia Jing] once again walked down the corridor holding a candlestick for illumination. He walked cautiously, observing the surroundings vigilantly. Eventually, he stopped in front of the pillar where [Hu Ji] had the accident. He kept scrutinizing the pillar, then circled it carefully, occasionally bringing the candlestick closer to it. Obviously, [Tian Ji'an] also felt that this was an unjust disaster.
1:27:21|1:27:39|Adding to the confusion was the remark left by [Nie Yinniang], prompting him to dispatch his trusted aide [Xia Jing] once again to investigate the matter. However, after a thorough search around the pillar, [Xia Jing] found nothing of value.
1:27:39|1:27:55|[Xia Jing] did not give up. He held up the candlestick and slowly circled around again. Suddenly, he stopped in his tracks and gazed for a long time. He then picked up a paper figure from behind a pillar. [Xia Jing] carefully examined the paper figure in his hand, and suddenly looked up as if he had remembered something.
1:27:55|1:28:7|Holding the paper figure, [Xia Jing] quickly left the corridor and appeared in [Tian Ji'an]'s study the next moment. At this time, [Tian Ji'an] was still standing in the room in official attire, and [Xia Jing] took out the paper figure from his arms and handed it to [Tian Ji'an].
1:28:10|1:28:22|[Tian Ji'an] took the paper figure from [Xia Jing] with a puzzled expression. After examining it for a while without understanding its meaning, before he could think further, he saw [Xia Jing] pulling out an identical paper figure from his pocket.
1:28:26|1:28:36|[Tian Ji'an] carefully compared two paper figures in his hands.
1:29:4|1:29:20|[Tian Ji'an] looked at [Xia Jing], then at the paper figure in his hand, already forming a plan in his mind. Tonight would be a sleepless night for many, with the densely lit torches in the Prefect's residence stretching out like a dragon. Under [Xia Jing]'s lead, a large group of soldiers moved silently.
1:29:20|1:29:36|Moved to the residence of Jing Jing'er, [Xia Jing] clearly understood that this person was not easy to deal with. He gathered the soldiers in the open space outside the house, first having a group of soldiers surround the house. Then, leading the remaining dozen or so soldiers with crossbows in hand, cautiously approached the outside of the house.
1:29:36|1:29:49|Xia Jing was the first to arrive at the front of the house, pressing his ear against the wooden door. Finally, Xia Jing broke through the door and rushed in with the soldiers. However, the scene in front of them was not as they had imagined, with no one fleeing.
1:29:49|1:30:6|Sitting upright at his own desk. The long white eyebrows mingled with the grayish-white beard in front of his chest, his eyes devoid of any light, yet staring unflinchingly at the unexpected visitors. The towering hooked nose coupled with drooping corners of the mouth, somehow instilled a sense of fear in people.
1:30:6|1:30:19|He calmly stood up, looking at the soldiers in front of him without any concern. [Xia Jing] didn't waste any words either, swiftly moving to the side. The soldiers behind him immediately raised their crossbows and shot at nothing. Nothing made any attempt to dodge.
1:30:19|1:30:43|With crossbow bolts piercing his chest, [Tian Xing] sat uneasily by the bedside with a neat appearance. His eldest son sat with pursed lips on the other side. When the nanny brought the two young children to her, she calmly got up and walked towards [Tian Ji'an], only to see [Tian Ji'an] angrily tearing two paper figures.
1:30:43|1:30:57|Tian Ji'an raised his hand in front of Nie Tian Shi. The perceptive eldest son resolutely opened his arms to shield his mother. At this moment, Tian Ji'an was already furious to the extreme, drawing his sword abruptly and pointing it directly at Nie Tian Shi. The surrounding servants and maidservants instantly stumbled and fell to their knees.
1:30:57|1:31:14|The eldest son was obviously frightened by his father's actions, trembling all over, but even so, he did not take a step back. The calmest person at the moment was actually the person involved, [Tian Yuanshi]. She still showed no fear on her face, calmly pulling the eldest son into her arms. After looking at each other for a long time,
1:31:14|1:31:22|[Tian Ji'an] lowered his sword, and his eldest son breathed a sigh of relief with lingering fear.
1:31:23|1:31:36|Tian Ji'an, who had nowhere to vent his anger, knocked over the vase beside him and left. Nie Tian Shi turned a blind eye to all this, patting her eldest son's arm and leading her back to the couch while comforting him. Upon hearing his mother's instructions, the eldest son obediently sat on the couch.
1:31:40|1:31:58|[Tian Yuen Shi] gestured to her two young sons to come over with a pat on their heads. The two already frightened children sat on either side of their older brother in a daze and didn't move again. [Tian Ji'an] took a few more steps forward, calmly moved the shattered pieces of the vase away from the children's feet, and then sat down steadily on the other side.
1:31:58|1:32:15|The eldest son finally regained his senses at this moment. He impatiently pulled up the sleeves that his younger brothers were sitting on, adjusted to a more comfortable position, and the maids who had been kneeling on the ground hesitantly stood up and approached. Upon hearing the instructions from the mistress, several maids came forward and squatted down together on the ground.
1:32:15|1:32:23|Picking up the shattered pieces of the vase smashed by [Tian Ji'an], the children's gazes also shifted over, quietly watching the nannies' nimble hands.
1:32:24|1:32:48|They first put the fragments into the vase, then picked up the scattered flower branches and piled them on the mouth of the vase. [Tian Ji'an] just glanced briefly at the ground and continued to look outside the house. After the maidservants left, the eldest son nodded thoughtfully, while the second son let out a sigh. The next day, there was a discussion in the main hall.
1:33:33|1:33:49|At the same moment, the weather outside the suburbs was exceptionally pleasant, with no glaring sunlight, and white clouds leisurely drifting in the sky. The Princess in nun's attire held a duster in her right hand, with her left hand resting behind her back.
1:33:49|1:34:5|Standing on the slope of the mountain top, she exudes an ethereal and graceful aura, blending seamlessly with nature at this moment, exuding a sense of aloofness from the world. Princess Tian Ji'an and Princess Nie Yinniang, though twins, have vastly different choices and beliefs.
1:34:5|1:34:24|With a shallow cut, Tian Ji'an devotes himself to the state, not knowing where to use the general. This is a portrayal of Princess Tian Ji'an's life. She went from being a princess who wanted to ride in a golden carriage to actively dismissing her maids. In order to fulfill the mission given to her by the emperor, her choice is to guard. Guarding Weibo without crossing the River Luo.
1:34:24|1:34:38|Maintaining peace between Weibo and the court. Throughout her life, she was caught between two political forces, as well as between her parents, siblings, husband, and children. If the Tang army conquers Weibo, her husband and children will die.
1:34:38|1:34:56|However, if the Wei Kingdom's power becomes too great and threatens the court, it is not something she wishes to see. The best choice is for both sides to seek peace. Yet Princess [Nie Yinniang] is devoted to the court, using assassination to help the court regain control of the regions. In order to achieve this goal,
1:34:56|1:35:4|Although she is a princess, she spent her life in Weibo as a nun to train assassins, a path that is destined to be lonely.
1:35:4|1:35:20|At this mountain top is where she and [Nie Yinniang] agreed to meet. Regardless of whether [Nie Yinniang] completed the mission or not, she would report to her. Sure enough, as agreed, [Nie Yinniang] arrived, slowly walking up the mountain. The [nun] paid no attention to the arrival of [Nie Yinniang] and continued to gaze into the distance.
1:35:20|1:35:51|The master and disciple stood quietly for a long time, and then [Nie Yinniang] turned around, while the [nun] knelt down. In this moment of kneeling, [Nie Yinniang] had already made many decisions. The [nun] seemed to have known [Nie Yinniang]'s choice, so she showed no surprise.
1:35:54|1:36:10|[The nun] looked into the distance, still showing no intention of turning back, with a hint of helplessness and sigh in her tone. [Nie Yinniang] remained kneeling below the slope, silent for a long time. Finally, she changed from kneeling on one knee to both knees on the ground, respectfully kowtowing to [the nun] three times.
1:36:10|1:36:28|[Nie Yinniang]'s so-called rule of not killing disciples is actually a warning to [Jing Jing'er], telling her not to kill [Tian Ji'an] either. Whether it's for political reasons or family ties, [Nie Yinniang] has made it very clear why she doesn't kill. Yet [Jing Jing'er] still sees [Nie Yinniang] as nothing more than a tool for killing.
1:36:28|1:36:44|The assassin's tools do not need to consider their own killing intent. Up to this moment, [Tian Ji'an] still does not understand what [Nie Yinniang] is thinking. She still believes that the reason why [Nie Yinniang] does not kill [Tian Ji'an] is because of their childhood love. Three strikes, three bows, this is both an apology and a severing of grace.
1:36:44|1:36:58|[Nie Yinniang] got up and walked down the mountain without looking back. Before long, [Nie Yinniang] had reached the halfway point of the mountain, which was very spacious but overgrown with weeds, almost submerging half of her calves. However, [Nie Yinniang] paid no attention to it.
1:36:58|1:37:15|Walking slowly down the path, stepping on the weeds, the sky gradually darkened, no longer the beautiful scenery of the mountain top. At some point, Tian Ji'an also descended the mountain, walking with her hands clasped around the duster at a leisurely pace, nearly a hundred meters away from Nie Yinniang.
1:37:15|1:37:24|[Nie Yinniang] paid no attention to what was happening behind her, and walked straight down the mountain. From then on, the master and disciple went their separate ways completely.
1:37:26|1:37:40|Arriving at the foot of the mountain, [Tian Ji'an] suddenly swung her whisk towards [Nie Yinniang]. [Nie Yinniang], as if anticipating the move, bent down to dodge the attack from behind, then swiftly leaped towards [Tian Ji'an] and drew out the deadly dagger. [Tian Ji'an] reacted sharply and turned around.
1:37:40|1:37:55|Raising her dust-whisk, [Nie Yinniang] approaches with her face covered. As she ducks to avoid the floating dust, the blade in her hand swings towards [the nun]. The nun suddenly hesitates, looking at [Nie Yinniang] with an expression of disbelief. After a while, she slowly regains her composure.
1:37:55|1:38:12|Nie Yinniang gathered the dust wiper back into her hands. Tian Ji'an, with her back to the nun, put away the dagger and walked away without looking back. As long as she passed through the tree-lined path, endless sunlight awaited ahead. The nun gazed at Nie Yinniang's departing figure, unable to calm her emotions for a long time.
1:38:12|1:38:28|On the right side of her Daoist robe, there was a two-inch long cut, but it did not harm her at all. This is a paradise, completely different from the deceitful court. Thick tree trunks were chopped down and made into crude fences, enclosing a flock of sheep.
1:38:28|1:38:44|The old goat had snow-white wool and long beard naturally hanging down as it leisurely chewed under the sunlight, with two little lambs by its side looking harmless. A sturdy goat lazily lay in the stone trough, also chewing non-stop.
1:38:44|1:39:2|The most attractive thing is a black lamb in the corner of the fence, hiding behind the old sheep in a cluster of shadows, chewing on the wet leaves in front of it. [Mirror-polishing Boy] and the old man collecting herbs are gathered outside the sheep pen with the villagers, chatting and laughing, very content.
1:39:2|1:39:17|During the conversation, [Mirror-polishing Boy] casually looked up as if he had seen something. He hesitated for a moment, then excitedly stood up upon recognizing the newcomer. Pointing towards a direction, he quickly explained to the old man before dashing out of the courtyard.
1:39:17|1:39:33|[Nie Yinniang] appeared in the reeds leading a horse. When she saw the Mirror-polishing Boy running towards her, gasping for breath, [Nie Yinniang] smiled for the first time. The boy immediately took the reins and happily led the horse back.
