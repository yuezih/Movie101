0:0:41|0:1:0|Accompanied by the sound of music, the image gradually reveals a white lighthouse standing by the sea, which appears particularly tall and beautiful under the sun. Only two or three seagulls hover around the lighthouse, emitting cries from time to time. The waves keep surging on the sea, as if competing with the seagulls on the sea surface.
0:1:2|0:1:23|In the distance, the mountains under the setting sun are reflected by the lighthouse, and the boats sailing on the sea seem to merge with the water. Seagulls fly in the sky at a higher altitude, creating an incredibly beautiful ink painting. As the camera moves, the panoramic view of the town by the mountains and water gradually appears on the screen.
0:1:23|0:1:30|Looking down from the sky, the buildings in the seaside town are surprisingly neatly arranged, with cars shuttling back and forth among them.
0:1:33|0:1:54|Surrounding buildings clustered together, some even built halfway up the mountainside. From this vantage point, one could see the lighthouse and the sea below in the sunset. The vast sea rippled with the breeze, the distant lighthouse standing out prominently, while seagulls joyfully soared in the sunset.
0:1:54|0:2:0|With the appearance of the seaside town in the scene, the five characters of "Qindao City, China" slowly appear in the bottom right corner of the screen.
0:2:2|0:2:14|At this moment, the scene suddenly shifts to a building in Qin Island City, where anti-drug police officer [Zhou Chao] and his colleagues are observing outside the suspect's house.
0:2:22|0:2:24|[Zhou Chao] was about to get up, but was forced back by the sound of gunshots.
0:2:29|0:2:49|[Zhou Chao] rushed out to the outside of the house randomly, while his teammates were fighting with the suspect. With his cover, [Zhou Chao] moved towards the wall, only to find a suspect jumping out of the window to escape. On the other side, the other suspects had already been taken down by the police ambushing around, and [Zhou Chao] chased the escaping suspect into the alleyway.
0:2:49|0:2:59|Suddenly the phone rang, [Zhou Chao] had no time to spare. He saw him pounce and grab the suspect, throwing him to the ground, and the two started wrestling. Teammates rushed in to support.
0:3:1|0:3:8|Zhou Chao finally took out his phone. At this moment, the scene switched to a restaurant in Tokyo, Japan, where Zhou Kai and Ma Ke were walking.
0:3:22|0:3:25|[Zhou Kai] was on the phone when he was pushed by someone.
0:3:35|0:3:40|He glanced at the people around him who were talking in whispers, and the two of them continued to walk into the store.
0:3:51|0:4:13|When ordering food, [Ma Ke] suddenly smiled and looked to the side, then got up and left. [Zhou Kai] put down his phone and took off his jacket, seeing [Ma Ke] talking to a man in long black hair. At the same time, the sumo wrestling match in the restaurant was about to begin, and [Ma Ke] returned to his seat.
0:4:26|0:4:37|[Zhou Kai] turned his head helplessly, the competition on stage was reaching its climax, with two people wrestling fiercely, and suddenly another contestant was brought down to the ground.
0:4:45|0:5:8|The crowd stopped laughing and looked at [Ma Ke], but then burst into laughter at his funny antics. [Ma Ke] couldn't help but laugh as well, then sat down and raised his glass to signal to [Zhou Kai]. Just then, the title "A Better Tomorrow" appeared in the center of the screen.
0:5:21|0:5:33|The police are questioning inside, [Zhou Chao] and others have just finished questioning the suspect. On the other side in Tokyo, [Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke], led by a local guide, are going to meet the Japanese smuggling leader, Okamura. Okamura is currently soaking in a hot spring in the courtyard.
0:5:58|0:6:3|The servant of Gangcun brought fruit for three people, while he sat on the shore from the water and lit a pipe on the side.
0:6:8|0:6:19|He took a puff of his cigarette, lifted the tobacco pouch and offered it to the three of them. [Rubber Band] was about to step forward, but was pulled back by [Zhou Kai]. Gangcun then put down the tobacco pouch, and the attendant continued to massage his shoulders.
0:6:26|0:6:29|Soon after, the group entered the private room to have a meal.
0:7:1|0:7:4|To everyone's surprise, Gangcun suddenly took out a pistol and placed it on the table.
0:7:11|0:7:18|At this moment, [Rubber Band] sensed the tension and gestured for [Zhou Kai] and the others to sit down.
0:7:22|0:7:29|[Zhou Chao] glanced at the three people in the hall, then picked up the gun, loaded it, kicked the dining table with his foot, and scolded the three of them.
0:7:34|0:7:50|Rubber Band picked up the wine glass that had been kicked over on the table, and glanced at Zhou Kai, who had a serious expression. Zhou Kai and Ma Ke looked at Gangcun in silence. After a moment of contemplation, Zhou Kai picked up a toothpick from the table, examined it carefully, and then handed it to Gangcun.
0:7:50|0:7:58|Indicating that he was going to stab himself, [Ma Ke] looked at Gangcun with a serious expression. The atmosphere became tense for a moment, as both [Ma Ke] and [Rubber Band] focused intently.
0:8:1|0:8:13|[Zhou Chao] took the toothpick from [Zhou Kai] without saying a word, and then looked [Zhou Kai] up and down. Seeing no response from [Zhou Chao], [Zhou Kai] took the initiative to move closer to [Zhou Chao], indicating that he would not blink.
0:8:13|0:8:28|[Zhou Chao] then picked up a toothpick and aimed it at [Zhou Kai], getting closer bit by bit. [Rubber Band] looked increasingly nervous, while [Ma Ke] kept staring at the village. At this tense moment, the three of them never expected [Zhou Chao] to suddenly drop the toothpick and speak.
0:8:33|0:8:38|[Rubber Band] flexed his muscles, finally relaxing his tense body. [Zhou Kai] looked at [Gangcun], and both of them smiled.
0:8:44|0:9:2|The next morning, a group of seagulls flew over the sea, and the scene shifted to the bustling port. The port was filled with the sounds of loading and unloading, with orderly cranes busy moving goods. There were two or three workers inspecting the goods nearby, along with trucks transporting goods, and a cargo ship anchored at sea.
0:9:2|0:9:9|Trucks coming and going along the shore, carrying goods, while [Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke] are inspecting the cargo at this port.
0:9:59|0:10:12|On the other side, [Ma Ke] is chatting with the sailors outside. The sailor asks him how many times he has been successful recently. Ma Ke proudly draws three with his hand, sarcastically saying, "Who's like you?" Then he continues, "I heard you guys are having a harder time."
0:10:12|0:10:22|Before long, [Rubber Band] boarded the ship, and the crew greeted him, saying they hadn't seen him in a long time. Then, the sound of the departing whistle rang out as the ship officially sailed away from the Japanese port.
0:10:22|0:10:47|In a blink of an eye, two days later, inside Qingdao City Hospital, [Zhou Chao] slowly opened his eyes by the bedside, looking at his father who was sleeping on the bed. He then went to the nurse station to visit his girlfriend. Just then, his girlfriend spoke. [Zhou Chao] took the almost falling medicine bottle, turned around and placed it properly.
0:11:1|0:11:11|On the other side, [Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke] are out at sea, where the water is calm and the view is clear. A cargo ship filled with goods is sailing by, and occasionally a seagull or two flies overhead.
0:12:6|0:12:9|At this moment, Mr. Pingjing suddenly appeared.
0:13:3|0:13:18|[Ma Ke] pulled the trigger, aiming the gun at his own forehead, but was stopped by [Zhou Kai]. After returning the gun to Pijing, [Zhou Kai] left dutifully, and [Ma Ke] followed suit.
0:13:21|0:13:34|On the sea surface of Jingdao City, the maritime police are patrolling, while [Zhou Chao] and his colleagues are standing on the shore watching their backs. At this moment, [Zhou Chao] says. Meanwhile, [Zhou Kai] and others are guiding a small boat to approach the cruise ship on the sea.
0:13:34|0:13:50|After the small boat was moored, the workers immediately opened the hatch and started to move the packaged goods onto the boat one by one. At this moment, [Zhou Kai] stood by the side of the boat, surveying the surroundings, while [Ma Ke] tidied up his clothes on the side and looked confidently at [Zhou Kai]. Finally, the two of them looked towards the small boat together.
0:13:51|0:14:12|On the other side, as the coast guard's boat gradually approached the cruise ship, unknowing [Zhou Kai] was calmly moving cargo, while the small boat next to the cruise ship quickly filled its hold at a visible speed. After the cargo hold was covered, [Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke] climbed down the ladder from the ship, bid farewell to the sailors, and sailed away.
0:14:14|0:14:16|Over here, [Zhou Chao] and his colleagues are still waiting on the shore.
0:14:53|0:15:9|At this moment on the sea, [Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke] are guiding the yacht to approach the small boat. The yacht is speeding across the sea and then comes to a stop. The people on the small boat are busy transferring the goods onto the yacht one by one. On the vast sea, only the busy figures of the people moving the goods can be seen.
0:15:9|0:15:12|At this moment, [Ma Ke] looked back and suddenly spoke. [Zhou Kai] turned around to see the coast guard fleet.
0:15:23|0:15:44|On the boat, [Zhou Kai] bid farewell to the workers, then the workers drove away in a small boat. [Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke] each drove their yachts quickly away, the two of them smiled at each other on the sea, with a relentless sea view chasing behind the yachts. The two yachts were speeding on the sea, creating layers of splashes.
0:15:53|0:16:10|Before long, the small boat that the two had just unloaded was caught up by the police, and everyone on board was arrested. After looking back to check the situation, [Zhou Kai] nodded to signal [Ma Ke]. [Ma Ke] immediately understood, and at that moment, a fierce fire was blazing at the back of his yacht.
0:16:10|0:16:18|He then quickly found the direction where [Zhou Kai] was, and when [Zhou Kai] noticed, he immediately turned the yacht towards [Ma Ke], while the maritime police were observing the two from behind.
0:16:21|0:16:47|Upon the moment the two yachts approached each other, [Ma Ke] leaped onto [Zhou Kai]'s yacht. They then high-fived and celebrated before driving the yacht away. The coast guard behind them looked puzzled, while [Ma Ke] smirked triumphantly. As the sky darkened, [Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke] sailed the yacht to the shore of Qin Island City.
0:17:1|0:17:8|The two of them walked down from the yacht with backpacks, approaching a sewer entrance by the shore. [Zhou Kai] led the way with a flashlight, followed by [Ma Ke].
0:17:35|0:17:48|The two men touched hands and then left. In a flash, [Ma Ke] walked up to a ladder. He held a flashlight in his mouth, took off his jacket, pulled out another piece of clothing from his bag, put it on, and then climbed up the ladder.
0:17:50|0:18:2|Upon reaching the top, [Zhou Kai] pushed open the manhole cover with his hand and looked around. Then he climbed out of the sewer, replaced the manhole cover, and strode towards the nearby restaurant, stepping over a bench.
0:18:11|0:18:30|On the other side, near the trash can, after someone had just finished dumping the garbage, [Zhou Kai] cautiously pushed open the manhole cover, looked around, and then climbed out of it. Next to him were lively decorations. He crossed the street, walked into the alley next to the street, occasionally looking back, and soon arrived downstairs at his own home.
0:18:30|0:18:40|[Zhou Kai] glanced back to make sure no one was following before confidently walking towards the stairs. He quickly ascended the stairs, all the while keeping an eye on his surroundings.
0:18:42|0:19:6|But just as he reached the second floor corridor, suddenly a figure appeared from the side stairs and inexplicably pinned him against the wall. He loosened the bag full of luggage, his hands pressed against the wall, unable to move for a moment, so he had to let this person check him back and forth. This person became more and more brazen.
0:19:10|0:19:12|[Zhou Kai] took advantage of the man's unpreparedness and turned around to grab him.
0:19:58|0:20:1|On the other side of the restaurant, [Ma Ke] is explaining the situation to [Brother Ha].
0:20:11|0:20:16|[Ma Ke] sat at the bar drinking, when suddenly, the voice of the resident singer Yang Yang rang out on stage.
0:22:9|0:22:14|Mr. Zhou looked at [Zhou Chao] in front of him, and [Zhou Chao] then held his father's hand.
0:22:36|0:22:47|Lu Lu suddenly walked into the ward. [Zhou Chao] looked awkwardly at [Zhou Kai], and [Zhou Kai] suddenly smiled.
0:23:11|0:23:17|In the hospital room, [Zhou Kai] suddenly turns off the TV. Meanwhile, at the police station.
0:23:39|0:23:44|At the same time, [Zhou Kai] hopped and skipped to the seaside harbor, heading towards the brightly lit yacht.
0:24:1|0:24:14|[Zhou Kai] carries Meiling into the boat, with someone following. Meiling takes off her coat while talking, and at this moment, the phone rings.
0:24:15|0:24:25|After hanging up the phone, he looked at [Zhou Kai], who then spoke.
0:24:31|0:24:41|[Zhou Kai] looked at Meiling in his arms and couldn't help but lower his head to kiss her neck, and then the two fell onto the bed. Meanwhile, in the hotel, [Ma Ke] and Yang Yang were lying on the bed.
0:24:58|0:25:10|[Ma Ke] lifted his head close to Yang Yang, looking into his eyes. Then he fell asleep on Yang Yang's lap, while Yang Yang sat up and poured the red wine in his hand onto the tattoo on [Ma Ke]'s back.
0:25:11|0:25:22|The next day at the restaurant, [Zhou Kai] pushed open the private room door, where [Brother Ha] and [Rubber Band] were already seated, with Brother Ha's followers waiting outside.
0:26:9|0:26:16|At this moment, [Ma Ke] suddenly saw [A Cang] staring at Meiling, and spoke up to remind him. [A Cang] heard the sound and averted his gaze.
0:26:48|0:26:50|The crowd raised their glasses and [Zhou Chao] suddenly spoke up.
0:27:25|0:27:27|Zhou Kai glanced at [Rubber Band] and turned to [Brother Ha].
0:28:28|0:28:55|[Brother Ha] finished speaking and raised his wine glass, drinking it all in one gulp. At this moment, everyone looked at [Zhou Kai], who remained silent with his head down. He then reluctantly took out a USB drive. After [Zhou Kai] finished speaking, everyone fell silent. [A Cang] looked at [Brother Ha] in confusion.
0:29:0|0:29:6|[Rubber Band] smiled and was about to pick up the USB drive in the wine glass, but it was snatched away by [Ma Ke].
0:29:19|0:29:24|The intruding follower immediately went out and closed the door upon hearing this. Ma Ke and [Rubber Band] continued to fight fiercely.
0:29:33|0:29:54|At this moment, [Zhou Kai] suddenly stood up, took out a USB drive, broke it in half, and then threw it into a glass. After the meal, the group walked out of the private room, with [Brother Ha] walking side by side with [Zhou Kai]. [Brother Ha] leaned in close to [Zhou Kai]'s ear.
0:30:4|0:30:13|After speaking, [Zhou Kai] left under the gaze of [Brother Ha]. Once outside the restaurant, he drove away with [Ma Ke], who was lying in the passenger seat.
0:30:50|0:31:17|The sun was setting in the west, with two or three seagulls flying over the sea. Inside the police station, Zhou Chao and others were having a meeting. Captain Guo kept urging Zhou Chao. Meanwhile, Zhou Kai walked into the restaurant.
0:31:20|0:31:33|The two walked towards their seats under the guidance of the waiter, [Zhou Kai] looked around, then they walked to their seats, the other two stood up in front of them, shook hands, and sat down.
0:31:49|0:32:0|At the same time, Ma Ke stopped the taxi next to the Old Ma Bar, got out of the car, walked up the stairs, and pushed the door open. The bar was filled with people enjoying themselves, and Ma Ke had a smile on his face.
0:32:11|0:32:30|He sat at the bar and asked the person next to him, who pointed to a photo on the bar. [Ma Ke] turned around and saw a photo of [Zhou Kai] carving a fire on the bar. He took out a lollipop from his pocket and put it in his mouth. At that moment, his phone suddenly rang.
0:32:43|0:32:57|At this moment, the performance on stage is reaching its climax. [Zhou Kai] takes the box from the ground to the table and asks the other party if they can inspect the goods. Unexpectedly, he is stopped by the other party, but he still insists on inspecting the goods.
0:33:2|0:33:21|After speaking, he turned and left. At this moment, Zhou Kai's phone suddenly rang. Meanwhile, A Cang came out from the back door, only to see a police car on the side. He slowly retreated back towards the door.
0:33:25|0:33:34|[Ma Ke] randomly took a taxi to the restaurant. At this moment, [Zhou Chao] and Guo Dui also walked into the restaurant. After hanging up the phone, [Zhou Kai] immediately took back the suitcase from the two men across the table.
0:33:37|0:33:52|But the two on the opposite side stood up, [Zhou Kai] reluctantly agreed, and the three of them prepared to leave together. However, as soon as [Zhou Kai] turned around and took a few steps, the other side pointed a gun at his lower back. He pretended to walk away as if nothing had happened.
0:33:52|0:34:3|At this moment, the crowd in the store is cheering for the performance on stage. [Zhou Kai] takes advantage of the chaos to knock the gun out of the person behind him and push him down, then hurriedly runs towards the bar. At this moment, [Zhou Chao] and others think they have been alerted.
0:34:5|0:34:18|The person who was pushed down immediately picked up the gun and shot at [Zhou Kai], who quickly jumped off the bar and dared not move. The scene was chaotic, and Guo, who was ambushing on the side, shot and injured the person with the gun at any time, while [Zhou Kai] took the opportunity to escape.
0:34:18|0:34:31|[Zhou Kai] slipped out from the back door and saw [A Cang] hiding on the side, signaling him to follow. At this moment, [Zhou Chao] also walked out from the back door, and the two of them hurriedly opened the manhole cover on the roadside and went down the ladder, with [Zhou Chao] following with a gun.
0:34:32|0:34:50|He climbed down the ladder, walked out of an iron gate, carefully observing the surroundings, only to see water flowing everywhere and an endless tunnel. Then he faintly heard some voices, forgetting about the sound. On the other side, Zhou Kai and A Cang were near a ladder.
0:35:2|0:35:14|The two of them paused, stopped their actions and stayed in place. With a gunshot, they hurriedly fled in the opposite direction.
0:35:21|0:35:43|[Zhou Chao] also caught up with the two. [Zhou Kai] was helping up [A Cang] when he was unfortunately shot by [Zhou Chao]. However, the two immediately got up and ran away, hiding in a secluded spot in panic. [Zhou Chao] then chased after them, reaching a iron gate where he looked inside and saw no one, then continued to pursue.
0:36:39|0:36:49|At this moment, [Zhou Chao] has caught up with [Zhou Kai]. He raises his gun and stands behind [Zhou Kai], checking if there is anyone behind. [Zhou Kai] then slowly raises one hand.
0:36:54|0:37:18|[Zhou Chao] slowly approached [Zhou Kai]. Inside the taxi, [Ma Ke] looked serious. Then, [Zhou Kai] dropped his phone and slowly raised his other hand, stopping in place. [Zhou Chao] held a gun and cautiously approached him. Suddenly, [Zhou Kai] fell to the ground, and at that moment, the sound of police cars could be heard around them.
0:37:18|0:37:28|In the taxi at this moment, after [Ma Ke] hung up the phone, the driver spoke. [Ma Ke] glanced at the driver, then opened the door and got out of the car.
0:37:51|0:38:3|On the other side, [Zhou Chao] walked up to [Zhou Kai] and took out handcuffs. At this moment, [Zhou Kai], who was lying on the ground, suddenly turned around. [Zhou Chao] looked at his brother on the ground, with an incredulous expression on his face. [Zhou Kai] looked up at his younger brother.
0:38:3|0:38:19|After exchanging a glance, [Zhou Chao] stood still, with a stiff expression, slowly lowering the gun in his hand. At this moment, [Zhou Kai] was lying on the ground, exhausted, while other police officers had arrived. They ran towards [Zhou Kai], took the handcuffs from [Zhou Chao]'s hand and put them on [Zhou Kai], helping him up.
0:38:20|0:38:24|[Zhou Kai] stood up and looked at the expressionless [Zhou Chao].
0:38:28|0:38:46|The crowd then left, leaving [Zhou Chao] standing still. Meanwhile, [Ma Ke] was running frantically along the shore, his destination unknown. After a while, he gradually slowed down and stopped, gasping for breath. The scene then shifted to the hospital, where [Zhou Kai] was lying on a hospital bed with the police standing beside him.
0:38:53|0:39:10|[Zhou Chao] stood outside the ward with a blank expression, [Zhou Kai] lay silently inside, while in Brother Ha's car, his men were rummaging through Zhou Kai's boat. The girl in the car, Meiling, spoke up.
0:39:21|0:39:27|Mei Ling was about to get off the car, but was pushed back in by someone. Inside the car, [A Cang] took out a syringe at this moment.
0:39:40|0:39:58|[Zhou Chao] bid farewell to his colleagues at the hospital, while at the same time, someone with a flashlight entered his house. The intruder turned out to be one of [Brother Ha]'s men. After entering the door, he looked around and then carefully walked towards the cabinet in the living room, opened the drawer, and searched around with the light from the flashlight.
0:39:58|0:40:2|At this moment, [Zhou Kai], who was sleeping in the room, was awakened and came out to check the situation.
0:40:11|0:40:28|[Zhou Chao] picked up a floor lamp and smashed it towards the villain, but at this moment [Zhou Kai] had just arrived downstairs. Immediately, he ran towards the scene, while [Zhou Kai] was being grabbed by the villain. The villain took out a dagger and stabbed towards [Zhou Kai], as [Zhou Chao] rushed into the house.
0:40:30|0:40:46|[Zhou Chao] immediately bent down to check on his father, while the thug still tried to approach. He quickly stood up, pushed the thug to the counter, hit his head with his elbow, and then held the thug tightly to prevent him from moving. The thug tried to lift [Zhou Chao] with both hands, but [Zhou Chao] firmly gripped his neck with his arm.
0:40:50|0:41:9|Then, leveraging his strength, he fiercely kicked the head of the thug with his knee. The two then crashed through the glass door and fell to the ground. Seizing the opportunity, the thug pinned [Zhou Chao] down, choking him. Unable to resist for a moment, [Zhou Chao] intended to pick up a nearby wooden stick, but the thug controlled his arm and directed it towards himself, watching as the stick got closer and closer.
0:41:10|0:41:28|At a critical moment, [Zhou Kai] suddenly picked up a piece of wood from the ground, stabbed it into the back of the thug, and then fell to the side. The thug then fell to the ground, and only then did [Zhou Chao] hurriedly get up and look at [Zhou Kai].
0:41:28|0:41:37|[Zhou Kai], who is seriously injured, is about to pass out. [Zhou Chao] takes him to the hospital, then sits in the corridor crying in pain, while [Ma Ke] and others have also arrived at the hospital.
0:41:39|0:41:56|The scene shifts to Japan three days later, the night sea is very quiet, only [Ma Ke] walks with a backpack on the bustling street, he arrives at the previous restaurant to meet his Taiwanese friend. The restaurant is very lively, the two sit in a private room, and after [Ma Ke] packs up, he takes the bag and leaves.
0:41:58|0:42:19|He drove the yacht alone on the dark sea, then arrived at the town. The Japanese street was bustling with people at night. Ma Ke got off the boat and walked on the street. He looked around, took off his backpack, took something out of it and put it in his pocket, then casually threw the backpack away and continued walking forward.
0:42:19|0:42:40|His expression was firm and determined. He dodged the crowd on the street for the longest time, then walked steadily towards the restaurant in front of him. [Ma Ke] smiled and walked into the restaurant. The staff at the door bowed to welcome him. Then, [Ma Ke] walked through the door and into the path of bamboo groves.
0:42:42|0:43:0|Underneath a beautiful loft, surrounded by fake trees, giving off a very pleasant feeling. [Ma Ke] looked up to see the dancers on the loft. At this moment, a shop assistant approached, and [Ma Ke] stepped aside to let them pass.
0:43:0|0:43:2|The clerk bowed to [Ma Ke] and then left with a tray.
0:43:3|0:43:17|After the clerk left, [Ma Ke] looked up at the attic and saw [Rubber Band] and [Steel Village] eating. Then, [Ma Ke] imitated the dance moves of the dancers on the attic, swaying his arms and dancing as he walked forward.
0:43:17|0:43:31|He then squatted down and hid a handgun in the gap between the attic and the ground, before continuing to walk and jump, placing a second handgun next to a street lamp. Meanwhile, upstairs, [Rubber Band] was drinking and having a good time, completely unaware of the impending danger.
0:43:34|0:43:47|Ma Ke was about to go upstairs when he saw a girl in a plaid skirt next to the stairs. The little girl looked at Ma Ke with a puzzled expression, and behind her stood a tall girl in the same outfit leaning against the box door.
0:43:49|0:44:9|Not understanding the situation, Ma Ke walked to the side of the stairs and gestured for the two girls to come over. He then took out two lollipops and handed them to the girls with a smile. The taller girl nodded to the other girl, and they accepted the lollipops, expressing their thanks. Ma Ke gestured for them to leave and put his index finger to his lips, making a "shh" sound.
0:44:11|0:44:16|He then solemnly walked up the stairs and pulled out a gun.
0:44:19|0:44:34|Ma Ke pushed him down the stairs, then turned and opened the compartment door aiming at [Rubber Band], firing several shots in a row. He then approached with a rifle against [Rubber Band]'s forehead and fired another shot. Snow saw his face, but he showed no fear at all, with a fierce and menacing look on his face.
0:44:37|0:44:51|Seeing the figure of [Rubber Band] falling down, he breathed a sigh of relief. The dancer next to him was scared off by the gunshots, and Ma Ke also turned around to leave. At this moment, [Zhou Kai] suddenly pulled out a gun and aimed it at him, while the attendant beside him also nervously prepared to stand up.
0:44:57|0:45:16|During the confrontation, the ground started shaking, causing the customers in the shop to scatter. [Ma Ke] almost fell to the ground, and a servant nearby lifted a table and smashed it towards [Ma Ke]. [Ma Ke] quickly dodged and the servant then grabbed [Ma Ke] and threw him to the ground, before overpowering him and repeatedly hitting his head.
0:45:16|0:45:18|Gangcun saw the situation and walked out.
0:45:19|0:45:34|[Ma Ke] kept hitting the opponent's arms, then sat up and shot at the approaching reinforcements. He then injured the leg of the person next to him, but was suddenly grabbed by another person. He then injured the person's leg again, causing the person to hastily retreat.
0:45:34|0:45:46|At this moment, suddenly a person rushed in, [Ma Ke] hurriedly injured his ankle, and saw another person preparing to get up. He quickly picked up the pistol on the ground, shot at him, then got up and walked out, but was forced back by the gunfire downstairs.
0:45:47|0:46:5|Inside the house, [Ma Ke] injured the people inside, then backed up against the stairs and shot upstairs. After coming downstairs, he picked up a hidden handgun and shot the legs of the others before leaving. At that moment, [Zhou Kai] suddenly emerged from the house, aimed his gun at [Ma Ke], and shot him in the leg.
0:46:6|0:46:19|Ma Ke fell to the ground and crawled towards the attic, reaching for the handgun he had hidden before. Zhou Chao, however, fired another shot towards the ground next to Ma Ke, then glanced at Ma Ke standing still, and walked away.
0:46:19|0:46:30|Ma Ke walked down the street with a limp, his face covered in blood, causing passersby to look at him in fear. However, he paid no attention to their stares. He walked all the way to the shore, then drove a yacht away from here alone.
0:46:35|0:46:45|On the other side, [Zhou Chao] held a photo of Yu Zhou Kai from his childhood, standing by the window lost in thought. He glanced at the photo, then turned silently and smashed it fiercely on the ground.
0:46:47|0:47:3|Three months later, the sea surface of Qin Island City remained calm as usual, with occasional seagulls flying by. Inside the prison cell, [Zhou Kai] stood silently by the window, staring blankly outside.
0:47:3|0:47:12|At this moment, after the cameraman finished washing up and returned to the dormitory to tidy up the bed, [Zhou Kai] also slowly sat down at the edge of the bed, completely isolated from the outside world by this square cage.
0:47:14|0:47:33|On the other side of the shore, Ma Ke stopped slowly with a cane in hand, looking into the distance. His left leg was wrapped in bandages, and the wound on his face had not yet healed. The sea breeze scattered his messy hair as he simply turned his head away.
0:47:33|0:47:39|And over here, in the police station, [Zhou Chao] is practicing shooting in the shooting range, then he goes to the training ground to practice combat with his colleagues.
0:47:41|0:47:58|[Zhou Chao] threw a punch at his teammate, only to be thrown to the ground by him. He then got up and kept punching the sandbag. When he got home at night, he fell asleep immediately. His wife, now, Lulu, patiently bandaged his waist for him. The next day, in the prison cell, someone walked up to [Zhou Kai] who was folding paper bags.
0:48:8|0:48:23|Yu Jing interrupted the man, [Zhou Kai] just froze in his actions without saying a word. Meanwhile, [Zhou Chao] arrived at a tavern by taxi, where [Ma Ke] was having a meal. He sat down across from [Ma Ke], who then looked up at him.
0:48:36|0:49:0|The waiter brought the dishes to the table, and [Zhou Chao] spoke up. Ma Ke was busy eating and didn't say anything, while [Zhou Chao] continued talking. Ma Ke looked up at [Zhou Chao] and spoke after finishing his meal.
0:49:1|0:49:6|[Zhou Chao] listened without responding, then looked away. Ma Ke continued eating.
0:49:17|0:49:21|Ma Ke chuckled lightly and looked at [Zhou Chao].
0:49:29|0:49:48|After saying that, he got up and left. The scene suddenly switched to inside the prison cell, where [Zhou Kai] was looking outside through the bars. Meanwhile, in the police training room, [Zhou Chao] knocked down his teammate. On the other side, [Zhou Kai] was either sitting in the dormitory or sitting silently on the playground.
0:49:48|0:49:55|Suddenly, half a year later, four or five cars appeared on the streets of Qindao City, chasing each other, causing pedestrians to dodge.
0:49:59|0:50:25|[Zhou Chao] pulled the criminal out of the car at gunpoint. [Zhou Kai] watched the news report on TV in the dormitory. Meanwhile, by the coast, [Zhou Chao] was arresting the criminal. With [Zhou Chao]'s outstanding performance at work, the police station awarded him a badge as an encouragement.
0:50:25|0:50:56|The scene shifts to [Zhou Chao]'s home, where he is celebrating his birthday with Lu Lu. After blowing out the candles, Lu Lu presents him with a gift. Meanwhile, in prison, [Zhou Kai] sits in the courtyard, watching someone singing nearby.
0:51:25|0:51:28|He looked at [Zhou Kai], then turned around and prepared to get up and leave.
0:51:34|0:51:55|After the man finished speaking, three years passed in the blink of an eye. [Zhou Kai] walked out of the prison gate carrying luggage and a backpack. Just a few steps out, he saw someone setting off firecrackers across the street, and someone else leaping into the arms of the newly released person behind him. A taxi waiting by the roadside quickly picked up the person and drove away.
0:51:55|0:51:58|[Zhou Kai] stood still, looking around in confusion.
0:52:7|0:52:27|[Zhou Kai] ignored Rack's voice, turned and walked away, while [Zhou Chao] drove and stopped beside him shortly after. [Zhou Kai] stopped and turned to look into the car, but [Zhou Chao] did not look at him. Then [Zhou Kai] got in the car, and the two drove along the seaside road. Suddenly, [Zhou Kai] broke the silence.
0:52:43|0:52:58|[Zhou Chao] suddenly slammed on the brakes, got out of the car aggressively, and walked towards the passenger seat. Opening the door, [Zhou Kai] kept silent and looked at him. He suddenly spoke. [Zhou Kai] was stunned for a few seconds after hearing it, then unbuckled the seatbelt and prepared to get out of the car.
0:53:32|0:53:59|Later, he picked up [Zhou Kai]'s luggage on the roadside and viciously smashed it towards [Zhou Kai]. After saying that, he kicked [Zhou Kai] hard, and then left angrily. Driving away in the car, leaving [Zhou Kai] alone. At this moment, [Zhou Kai] was still lying on the ground in pain, unable to recover for a long time.
0:54:1|0:54:25|After a while, he slowly stood up. Meanwhile, [Zhou Chao] had already driven home and was sitting on the sofa, staring blankly. Suddenly, Lulu walked in. Lulu put down her bag and picked up the kettle, while [Zhou Chao] remained silent.
0:54:28|0:54:48|Lulu put down the water bottle and approached [Zhou Chao], looking at his hand. It was then that [Zhou Chao] reacted. Lulu took out the medicine and applied it to [Zhou Chao]. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. Lulu went to open the door upon hearing the sound. As soon as she opened the door, she saw [Zhou Kai] standing outside.
0:54:48|0:54:52|[Zhou Chao] suddenly ran over to close the door in the room, while [Zhou Kai] used his hand to hold the door.
0:54:56|0:55:19|After saying that, he prepared to close the door, but [Zhou Kai] still refused to let go. Lulu then pulled [Zhou Chao] aside. [Zhou Kai] pushed the door open and rubbed his shoes on the doormat, closed the door, and then placed the luggage next to the shoe cabinet. [Zhou Chao] stared at [Zhou Kai].
0:55:19|0:55:21|At this moment, Lulu walks over and hands a cup of water to [Zhou Kai].
0:55:27|0:55:50|He picked up the water and placed it aside without drinking, then quietly walked towards his father's portrait. [Zhou Chao] sat motionless on the sofa without saying a word. [Zhou Kai] approached the portrait, took a step back, knelt down, and kowtowed to his father's photo.
0:55:50|0:55:55|The room was very quiet for a moment, with no one speaking except for the sound of [Zhou Kai] knocking his head.
0:55:58|0:56:16|From then on, [Zhou Kai] stopped moving, stood up slowly with red eyes, took a step forward, and spoke while looking at his father's photo. Upon hearing this, [Zhou Chao] recalled the previous scenes.
0:56:33|0:56:46|[Zhou Chao] finished speaking, lowered his head and covered his eyes with his hand, while [Zhou Kai] remained silent, looking at the photo on the table by the wall. He then walked to the shoe cabinet, picked up his luggage, and [Zhou Chao] watched him stand up and said.
0:56:55|0:57:21|Shortly after, [Zhou Kai] pushed the door and left. As the sky darkened, he walked alone on the street. Watching the brothers playing on the side of the street, [Zhou Chao] stopped and then found a bathhouse to take a bath.
0:57:31|0:57:36|He was taking a shower and recalling the words of the prisoners in jail.
0:57:47|0:58:0|[Zhou Kai] asked and then walked towards the ship. He looked around on the ship, but there was no one in sight, only scattered items. He looked around and suddenly heard someone singing.
0:58:19|0:58:40|[Ma Ke] slowly walked up the stairs, heard singing, and turned around to see [Zhou Kai]. He then put down the broom in his hand and quickly walked towards [Zhou Kai]. The two embraced each other excitedly, and [Ma Ke] cried tears of joy. After a while, they let go, and then he spoke. Suddenly, [Ma Ke] pointed to the wound on [Zhou Kai]'s face.
0:59:9|0:59:12|After speaking, he raised his right hand, and [Zhou Kai] reached out and held it.
0:59:16|0:59:38|[Zhou Kai] pulled out his hand, looked at the sea, and then spoke. [Ma Ke] randomly turned around, picked up a broom to sweep the floor, and then spoke. He then picked up a nearby rag, turned around to wipe the plastic bucket.
0:59:41|0:59:52|Following [Zhou Kai] walked in, threw away the rag, and asked. [Zhou Kai] nodded at him, faced with [Ma Ke]'s questioning, [Zhou Kai] did not speak, and [Ma Ke] continued.
1:0:26|1:0:32|Shortly after, [Ma Ke] turned around and left, with [Zhou Kai] following him in silence.
1:0:41|1:0:50|At this moment, [A Cang] suddenly appeared with his men. [Ma Ke] stood aggressively in front of [A Cang].
1:0:53|1:0:58|[A Cang] stepped aside to clear the way, looking at [Ma Ke]. Just as [Ma Ke] took a few steps, he was pushed into the sea by his men.
1:1:10|1:1:32|[Zhou Kai] grabbed [A Cang] by the collar and questioned him, while [Ma Ke] also swam to the shore. Only then did [Zhou Kai] let go of [A Cang]'s collar. [A Cang] turned and walked away, as [Zhou Kai] intended to help up [Ma Ke] on the shore.
1:1:44|1:2:0|[Zhou Kai] left and arrived at another port. The busy port in the early morning was filled with yachts scattered everywhere, and the distant sound of yacht horns could be heard. Three or four seagulls flew over the sea, and [Zhou Kai] slowly walked down towards the port in front of him.
1:2:4|1:2:26|Before long, she found her own boat. She jumped on board and opened the hatch to reveal a messy and dirty table. Then, [Mei Ling] stumbled out.
1:2:41|1:3:4|[Mei Ling] squatted next to the table, reaching for the bottle on the table. [Zhou Kai] snatched the bottle and threw it on the ground. The two remained silent for a moment, then suddenly Mei Ling's phone rang. After hanging up the phone, Mei Ling stayed in place, while [Zhou Kai] casually dropped his bag.
1:3:9|1:3:13|Mei Ling then stood up and walked numbly towards the edge of the bed.
1:3:22|1:3:33|[Zhou Kai] buried his head in Meiling's shoulder, rubbing against her neck without saying a word. After a while, Meiling numbly pushed away [Zhou Kai]'s arms that were holding her.
1:3:35|1:3:57|The scene cuts to the riverside, where [Zhou Kai] is sitting and fishing. Two ducks swim by on the water as he lifts his fishing rod, but there is no fish on the hook. He casts the hook back into the water. After a while, a small fish is caught on the hook. [Zhou Kai] looks at the fish on the hook thoughtfully, then he goes to find [Brother Ha].
1:4:19|1:4:28|After meeting Brother Ha, Zhou Kai was busy washing the car by the shore. He poured a bucket of water on the car and then picked up a cloth to wipe the body of the car.
1:4:28|1:4:40|The next morning, the scene shifts to the bustling seafood market, where crowds of people are busy selecting goods. [Zhou Kai] drives slowly to the market and parks his car before walking into the crowd.
1:4:41|1:4:54|The crowded people around jostled him back and forth, but he didn't mind at all, just looking around to choose goods. Then, he squatted down in front of a stall, at this moment, [Zhou Chao] was hiding on the side secretly observing him.
1:4:59|1:5:12|[Zhou Kai] puts the seafood into the car and then drives to the entrance of the restaurant. At this moment, the waiting chefs start unloading the goods from the car one by one. [Zhou Kai] also helps with the unloading, and all of this is observed by [Zhou Chao] sitting in the car by the roadside.
1:5:56|1:6:2|[Zhou Kai] stood up and waved his hand, then drove away in anger. Meanwhile, [Ma Ke] sat at the harbor.
1:6:48|1:6:50|[Ma Ke] slowly approached the two of them, looking at the front of Yang Yang.
1:7:0|1:7:17|He intended to leave, but heard the man speak. Then he suddenly turned around and punched the man, who fell to the ground holding his face. Yangyang looked shocked at Ma Ke's actions, then looked Ma Ke up and down. Looking at Ma Ke with his eyes covered by hair, he persistently said.
1:7:40|1:7:46|[Zhou Kai] arrived at the port at this moment and happened to witness this scene. [Ma Ke] slowly walked towards him and began to speak.
1:8:16|1:8:21|[Zhou Chao] is currently monitoring the situation outside the restaurant, and he sees Meiling getting out of the car with [A Cang].
1:8:25|1:8:30|Subsequently, [A Cang] embraced Meiling and walked into the store, while on the other side, [Zhou Kai] went to the morning market as usual.
1:8:42|1:8:53|The person who suddenly spoke was trapped in a fishing net. [Ma Ke] suddenly appeared and knocked him down, then lifted his leg and pushed another person into the sea. He waved the fishing net and shouted loudly.
1:8:53|1:9:2|Zhou Kai then kicked down the person who attacked, causing everyone to fall down. Ma Ke held up the leader with a stick, while Zhou Kai glanced at the person.
1:9:7|1:9:24|[Ma Ke] rested his arm on [Zhou Kai]'s shoulder, and the two exchanged a smile before leaving the place. The scene then shifted to a cruise ship at sea, where [Ma Ke] and [Zhou Kai] arrived by taxi. As they got out of the car and walked up the stairs, they saw a notice of demolition posted by the entrance, signed by Old Man Ma.
1:9:24|1:9:32|Shortly after, they pushed the door and entered the shop, with [Ma Ke] speaking first. The two raised their glasses and drank together.
1:9:46|1:10:3|[Zhou Kai] immediately opens the music box in the shape of a cruise ship in the car, while [Ma Ke] turns around and picks up a vinyl record, puts it into the record player, and starts dancing to the music. [Zhou Kai] sits at the bar, drinking and smiling as he watches [Ma Ke], who is completely immersed in the dance.
1:10:41|1:10:43|[Ma Ke] stared fiercely at [A Cang].
1:10:45|1:11:2|[Ma Ke] said nothing, pulled a chair and sat down, putting his legs on the table, blocking [A Cang]'s view. [A Cang] glanced at [Zhou Kai], gestured to his men that he was fine, then looked at [Ma Ke] and casually picked up a bottle of wine, saying.
1:11:2|1:11:7|[Ma Ke] glanced at the wine and smiled, took the bottle, [A Cang] was about to open the bottle.
1:11:8|1:11:20|[Ma Ke] smashed the bottle onto his injured leg, causing it to shatter on the ground, while [Ma Ke] remained motionless. [Zhou Kai] slowly walked over, handed [Ma Ke] a glass of wine, and then spoke.
1:11:47|1:11:50|[A Cang] takes off his jacket and sits down.
1:12:32|1:12:55|On the other side, [Zhou Chao] has arrived outside the bar. He gets out of the car and sees [A Cang]'s men having fun outside the bar. [Zhou Chao] glances at the people around him. Meanwhile, inside the bar, [A Cang]'s henchmen are whispering in his ear.
1:13:5|1:13:21|At this moment, [Zhou Chao] just entered the bar, followed by [A Cang] walking out of the bar. [A Cang] was walking towards the outside of the house, and then the two of them walked down the stairs and left.
1:13:37|1:13:44|[Zhou Kai] looks away.
1:14:20|1:14:31|Zhou Kai and Zhou Chao walked out of the bar, while Zhou Kai turned around. Outside the bar, Zhou Chao was about to leave, but was stopped by Ma Ke.
1:15:1|1:15:3|The two started fighting, with [Ma Ke] falling to the ground.
1:15:26|1:15:31|[Zhou Kai] finished speaking, walked towards [Ma Ke] and helped him up, while [Zhou Chao] turned and walked down the stairs.
1:15:32|1:15:48|[Zhou Kai] stood outside watching [Zhou Chao] drive away, then turned to look into the distance. [Ma Ke] walked beside him, looking down without saying a word. Meanwhile, [Zhou Chao] angrily roared in the car, then burst into tears before driving away.
1:16:39|1:16:49|A seagull flies over the sea at this moment, and the scene suddenly shifts to a restaurant where [Zhou Chao] walks in and looks around. He then takes out his police badge and stops in front of [Mei Ling].
1:16:55|1:17:14|[Mei Ling] looked away without answering, while [Brother Ha] was watching everything from upstairs. On the other side, [Ma Ke] took a taxi to an alley, where he got out of the car, put on a hat, and cautiously walked into the alley. He carefully looked around, and there were hardly any people in the alley, only a few individuals squatting outside a house in the alley.
1:17:14|1:17:16|[Ma Ke] saw a few people and quickly hid behind the wall.
1:18:3|1:18:16|Here, [Zhou Kai] hung up the phone, threw down the mobile phone, slapped the steering wheel in frustration, and then sighed. On the other side, [Ma Ke] had already lurked outside the house where [A Cang] was making drugs. After looking around, he took out a note with [Zhou Chao]'s phone number written on it.
1:18:21|1:18:42|At this moment, a van slowly drove into the alley. [Ma Ke] carefully observed the situation of the people outside the house, seeing them continuously moving things from the car into the house. After the van left, [Ma Ke] quietly pushed open the iron gate and slipped into the courtyard. He was spotted as soon as he entered the courtyard.
1:18:52|1:18:55|[Ma Ke] looked towards the warehouse on the second floor, and then was knocked unconscious.
1:19:13|1:19:15|He burst into the office of [Zhou Chao] and others.
1:19:21|1:19:24|Then, [Zhou Chao] walked out of the office.
1:20:9|1:20:18|On the other side, [Ma Ke] was being tied up in the courtyard and beaten. Then, [A Cang] sat next to him with a chair and spoke.
1:20:34|1:20:37|Ma Ke smiled, while [A Cang] stood up and stepped on his left leg.
1:20:44|1:20:51|Then everyone tied up Ma Ke and continuously beat him until he lay on the ground. [A Cang] saw all of this from upstairs.
1:20:54|1:20:56|At this moment, [Zhou Kai] has just walked out of the police station.
1:21:22|1:21:29|Suddenly, everyone in the courtyard ran towards the upstairs.
1:21:41|1:22:7|At this moment, outside the house, Guo's team disguised as deliverymen had already taken control of the entrance guards, followed by a large number of special police entering the alley. Guo's team also entered the courtyard. Meanwhile, the special police force slowly entered the courtyard. On this side, [A Cang] finished eating and immediately saw the police around, so the two of them turned and left.
1:22:10|1:22:29|Inside the house, some suspects were holding their heads and squatting down, while others were jumping from the second floor. At this moment, [Zhou Chao] spotted the fleeing [A Cang] and immediately gave chase. Upon hearing this, [A Cang] ran off. Meanwhile, the suspects in the courtyard were still stubbornly resisting the special police.
1:22:31|1:22:46|Here, [A Cang]'s henchman is hiding behind an iron gate, but [Ma Ke] suddenly appears behind him and strikes his head. Meanwhile, [A Cang] is running out of the alley, looking back from time to time, with [Zhou Chao] closely chasing after him.
1:22:46|1:22:55|[A Cang] pushed a passerby to the ground with a casual gesture, while [Zhou Chao] quickly helped the passerby up. Meanwhile, the special police were still engaged in a fierce battle with the suspect upstairs.
1:23:1|1:23:27|At this moment, [A Cang] snatched a car from a passerby. [Zhou Chao] had to borrow a car from another passerby to chase after [A Cang]. Meanwhile, in the courtyard, a special police officer knocked down the suspect on the second floor, allowing other special police officers to enter the room on the second floor. Inside the room, the suspect was about to shoot but was knocked down.
1:23:27|1:23:29|Here, [Zhou Chao] is still chasing after [A Cang].
1:23:33|1:23:50|The two of them drift back and forth in the tunnel, with [A Cang] making a sharp turn out of the tunnel.
1:23:55|1:24:14|[Zhou Chao] closely followed behind, and the two arrived near an abandoned port. [A Cang] made a sharp turn towards an abandoned factory, crashing through the factory gate, then breaking through obstacles, and finally driving out of the factory. They then drove onto the road next to the factory, with the speeding car constantly kicking up dust from the ground.
1:24:14|1:24:16|[Zhou Chao] is now leaving side by side with [A Cang].
1:24:24|1:24:40|Suddenly, [A Cang] picked up a gun and shot at [Zhou Chao]. [Zhou Chao] ducked, but accidentally hit a pile of debris on the side, forcing him to stop the car. [A Cang] then jumped out of the car and escaped on foot along the shore. Soon after, his car plunged into the sea.
1:24:40|1:24:51|[Zhou Chao] immediately got off the car and ran to the shore, only to see [A Cang]'s car sinking slowly into the sea. Then, he turned around and saw the manhole cover being moved on the shore.
1:26:14|1:26:17|After speaking, [Ma Ke] raised his right hand, and [Zhou Kai] chuckled as he patted his hand.
1:26:22|1:26:25|On the other side, [Zhou Kai] and others arrived at the restaurant to arrest [A Cang].
1:27:22|1:27:41|Then, [Zhou Kai] drove towards the agreed location. Meanwhile, [Zhou Kai] and the others did not find [A Cang]. At the same time, [Zhou Chao] arrived at the agreed location, he got out of the car and stood by the roadside preparing to cross the street. Meanwhile, [Zhou Kai] was also about to arrive nearby, and [Ma Ke] in the car suddenly spoke up.
1:27:48|1:27:58|[Zhou Chao] was crossing the road at this moment when suddenly, a van came speeding towards him, hitting [Zhou Chao] hard before quickly fleeing the scene, leaving him lying on the ground.
1:27:58|1:28:13|At this moment, [Zhou Kai] drove to the intersection. He slowly stopped the car, but suddenly saw [Zhou Chao] lying on the ground. He immediately unbuckled his seatbelt, got out of the car and ran towards [Zhou Chao], promptly taking him to the hospital. Later, he carried [Zhou Chao] on his back to the hospital.
1:28:28|1:28:45|[Zhou Kai] immediately ran towards the emergency room, while [Ma Ke] limped along behind. At that moment, [Zhou Chao] lay motionless on [Zhou Kai]'s back. [Zhou Kai] gritted his teeth and continued to run quickly towards the emergency room, as if everything around him seemed insignificant at that moment.
1:28:45|1:28:51|He kept running and standing, his hands supporting [Zhou Chao] so that [Zhou Chao] wouldn't slip off his back.
1:28:53|1:29:4|On the side, the strong nurse also helped support [Zhou Chao]. In no time, they arrived at the emergency room, where [Zhou Chao] was taken into the operating room, while [Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke] anxiously waited outside.
1:29:33|1:29:36|After Lulu finished speaking, she put on her mask again and walked into the operating room.
1:29:45|1:29:55|The scene shifts to the next day on the sea, with a vast expanse of water dotted with a few seagulls and a ship sailing. [Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke] are driving a small boat, gliding continuously.
1:29:58|1:30:8|On the other side, [Zhou Chao] slowly opened his eyes in the ward. He picked up the card left by Lu Lu on the cabinet next to him, and smiled after reading the words left by Lu Lu.
1:30:18|1:30:36|He sat up abruptly from the bed. Meanwhile, on the sea, A Cang was slowly steering the small boat towards the ship. Then, he climbed up the ship with the help of a rope. Shortly after, Zhou Kai and Ma Ke suddenly appeared on the ship. Upon seeing the two, A Cang immediately jumped off the small boat.
1:30:36|1:30:43|[Zhou Kai] also immediately jumped off the boat and chased after [A Cang]. [A Cang] ran to the stern of the boat, then continuously picked up things on the boat and threw them at [Zhou Kai].
1:30:44|1:31:8|The two immediately started fighting, and [Ma Ke] also came down from the ship at this time, pushing the attendants on the ship into the sea. [Ma Ke] threw a lifebuoy into the sea, then looked at [Zhou Kai].
1:31:18|1:31:32|[Zhou Kai] and [A Cang] are currently fighting in the sea, constantly stirring up bubbles in the water. In the water, [Zhou Kai] is holding [A Cang] down, pushing him underwater repeatedly, while [A Cang] keeps his eyes tightly shut and struggles.
1:31:32|1:31:43|Then, he turned around and broke free from [Zhou Kai], swimming upstream, only to be grabbed and pushed back into the water by [Zhou Kai] again. He struggled to break free, kicking his legs and thrashing in the water.
1:31:55|1:32:13|Shortly after, [Zhou Kai] swam to the side of the boat and climbed aboard. Then, the two of them helped [A Cang] onto the small boat. On the other side, [Zhou Chao] arrived at the harbor, found [Zhou Kai]'s boat, and then picked the lock to enter the boat, carefully observing the interior.
1:32:13|1:32:30|Later, he turned around and saw a childhood photo of himself and [Zhou Kai] on the wall. He stared at the photo thoughtfully, then turned his head to look elsewhere. He pushed open the door to the cabin on the boat and searched around.
1:32:30|1:32:38|At the same time, on the sea, [A Cang] is tied to the boat, while in the cockpit, [Zhou Kai] is driving the boat looking at the sea, and [Ma Ke] suddenly walks over.
1:32:50|1:33:15|[Ma Ke] took out a box and opened it, [Zhou Kai] watched his actions and then spoke. On the other side, [Zhou Chao] took out something wrapped in cloth on the boat, carefully opened it to reveal a handgun, and he picked up the gun, getting ready to inspect it.
1:33:18|1:33:36|At this moment, a strange sound suddenly came from outside. [Zhou Chao] turned his head to look outside the bed, then cautiously walked towards the door. Suddenly, his phone rang, he checked his pocket, then quickly opened the door and aimed the gun outside. The seagulls outside were startled and flew away, [Zhou Chao] then relaxed and turned back into the boat.
1:33:36|1:33:42|He took out the vibrating phone, on which appeared a video of Lu Lu being kidnapped, followed by a voice.
1:33:52|1:33:58|He recalled the card Lulu left him, saying to go home, and then he called his colleague.
1:34:11|1:34:31|At this moment, [Ma Ke] is squatting on the side, talking to [A Cang], and making a shooting gesture with a pistol against [A Cang]'s head. On the other side, [Zhou Chao] quickly starts the yacht and steers it towards the sea. The seagulls on the sea are startled by the yacht, and [Zhou Chao] anxiously looks into the distance.
1:34:38|1:34:43|[A Cang] glanced at [Zhou Kai] standing beside him, smiled, and then spoke.
1:34:51|1:34:53|[Zhou Kai] angrily squatted down and grabbed [A Cang].
1:34:57|1:34:59|Then he let go of [A Cang].
1:35:14|1:35:19|[Zhou Kai] stood up silently and then kicked [A Cang] fiercely.
1:35:19|1:35:40|On the calm sea, besides the small boat of [Zhou Kai] and [Zhou Chao], there is also [Zhou Chao]'s yacht speeding along. He is seen standing in the cockpit, turning the steering wheel towards an abandoned factory, causing waves to splash continuously on the sea. Soon, he docks the yacht ashore and slowly stops.
1:35:44|1:36:5|Shortly after, [Zhou Chao] disembarked and walked towards the shore. He looked around and then climbed the stairs on the side. After a few steps, he squatted down in front of a ruin and hid the pistol he brought. Then he stood up and slowly walked towards old [Ma Ke]. He ascended the stairs of the bar, observed the surroundings, and then entered the bar.
1:36:5|1:36:9|He just walked into the bar and looked around, and then a few people walked out behind him.
1:36:35|1:37:3|[Zhou Chao] raised his hands and allowed himself to be searched after hearing the instructions. At that moment, [Lulu] was taken out of the bar by someone. After walking a few steps, [Zhou Chao] was blocked by someone in front. Then, [Lulu] was taken away again. [Zhou Chao] turned around, walked to sit in front of [Zhou Kai], and spoke.
1:37:34|1:37:37|On the other side of the sea, [Zhou Kai] receives a call from [Brother Ha].
1:38:3|1:38:12|[Brother Ha] hung up the phone, then punched [Zhou Chao] who was tied to a chair. [Zhou Kai] didn't respond to [Ma Ke], but was busy adjusting the direction of the ship.
1:38:25|1:38:28|[Ma Ke] walked over and stuffed [A Cang]'s mouth.
1:38:37|1:38:59|After speaking, [Ma Ke] took out a gun and sat in the back of the driver's seat, while [Zhou Kai] drove the boat towards Lao Maba. The sea was calm at this moment, with no waves, the distant sunset gradually setting, and seagulls flying towards the distance. As night fell, [Zhou Kai] and the others stopped the boat and arrived at Lao [Ma Ke].
1:38:59|1:39:9|Two of them took [A Cang] up the stairs, then arrived on the shore, while [Zhou Chao] stood on the opposite side with his hands tied. [Brother Ha] got out of the car at this moment and walked over to look at the two of them.
1:39:35|1:39:38|[Zhou Kai] took a few steps forward and said.
1:40:4|1:40:27|[Zhou Chao] was then pushed forward by someone, and [A Cang] was also pushed forward. The two slowly walked towards each other face to face.
1:40:30|1:40:40|The two approached slowly, [Zhou Chao] suddenly tackled [A Cang] to the ground, took out the gun he had prepared earlier, and pointed it at [A Cang].
1:40:40|1:41:0|He kidnapped [A Cang] and looked towards [Brother Ha] and others. Suddenly, the person standing on the boat shot and injured [Zhou Chao], causing him to let go and fall to the ground. [Zhou Kai] immediately turned around and shot the person on the boat, while [A Cang] took the opportunity to escape. [Zhou Kai] then helped up the injured [Zhou Chao] and started to retreat, when suddenly, there was a loud noise behind the three of them.
1:41:0|1:41:19|[Zhou Kai], [Zhou Chao], and [Ma Ke] were immediately knocked down by the aftermath of the bomb, lying on the ground. [Brother Ha] and others hid behind the nearby car. [Brother Ha] looked at the three of [Zhou Kai], then pressed the button in his hand again. Just as [Zhou Kai] was slowly getting up, there was a sudden second explosion behind him.
1:41:19|1:41:30|Brother Ha quietly observed the three of them from the side, then stood up and spoke. At that moment, Zhou Kai suddenly ran towards Brother Ha.
1:42:2|1:42:6|[A Cang] suddenly fired a shot at [Brother Ha], leaving everyone shocked.
1:42:44|1:43:1|Finally, the crowd launched a fierce attack on [Zhou Kai] and the other two. [Zhou Chao] was hit in the leg during the fight and fell down. [Zhou Kai] immediately picked up [Zhou Chao] and hid nearby, while [Ma Ke] covered them. Then, the three of them hid together in the ruins, and [Zhou Chao] slowly spoke up.
1:43:1|1:43:3|[Zhou Kai] handed his phone to [Zhou Chao].
1:44:1|1:44:16|Outside the ruins, Brother Ha and others are still launching continuous attacks. Zhou Kai and Ma Ke exchange a glance, then resolutely step out of the ruins, shooting towards the opposite side with guns. One person on the eighth floor stairs is shot down by Zhou Kai.
1:44:16|1:44:34|At this moment, [Zhou Kai] strides forward, raising his gun with both hands, attacking fiercely while advancing. [Ma Ke] follows closely behind. Suddenly, [Zhou Kai] sees [A Cang] preparing to shoot from behind the car. He crashes into [Ma Ke], then gets shot by [A Cang] and falls to the ground.
1:44:34|1:44:44|[Ma Ke] was hit and rolled to the ground, then he got up violently and started shooting at the opposite side. Behind the ruins, [Zhou Chao] watched the two of them, picked up a handgun in pain, and then started shooting at the other side.
1:44:44|1:44:54|He struggled to get up and prepare to walk out of the ruins, but was shot in the leg by [A Cang] as soon as he stood up, then fell to the ground, while [Ma Ke] beside him was also hit and fell down.
1:45:6|1:45:12|The people on the opposite side did not react immediately, many of them were hit, and then they ran towards the back of the car to take cover.
1:45:18|1:45:35|At this moment, the car across the street was hit by bullets and suddenly exploded, throwing many people into the air. [Zhou Kai] stood up despite the pain and continued to attack the opponents with [Ma Ke]. However, facing a large number of enemies, [Zhou Kai] was shot again after taking only a few steps.
1:45:35|1:45:46|Ma Ke, who was standing aside, was also hit by a bullet and fell to the ground. Zhou Kai, Zhou Chao, and Ma Ke were lying on the ground, struggling to move slowly, while the gunfire around them gradually faded away.
1:45:47|1:46:9|Hidden behind the car, [A Cang] slowly emerged when he saw that the car's tail had not moved, approaching the three men and starting to speak.
1:46:33|1:46:35|[A Cang] looked fiercely at [Zhou Kai] on the ground.
1:46:37|1:47:2|At this moment, a sound suddenly came from the ruins. [A Cang] turned to look at the ruins, only to see [Zhou Chao] slowly walking out of the ruins, bending over to pick up the gun on the ground. [A Cang] watched him move slowly with unwavering eyes, then smiled. At that moment, [Zhou Kai] lying on the side suddenly spoke.
1:47:2|1:47:4|[A Cang] looked at the weak [Zhou Kai], while [Zhou Kai] continued to speak.
1:47:18|1:47:36|At this moment, [Ma Ke] was also weakly lying on the ground, looking at [A Cang] and [Zhou Kai]. Then, [Zhou Chao] slowly raised his gun, aiming at [A Cang]. [A Cang] slowly stood up and looked at [Zhou Chao]. He then raised his hand and fired, causing [Zhou Chao] to fall to the ground again.
1:47:47|1:48:0|[A Cang] finished speaking and prepared to leave. At this moment, [Zhou Chao] looked at [Zhou Kai] beside him and slowly reached out his hand. Suddenly, a gunshot rang out, and [A Cang]'s henchman fell to the ground.
1:48:3|1:48:21|Far in the distance, the special police force was slowly approaching with shields, while a large number of police cars rushed to support. [A Cang], seeing this, hurriedly ran to the shore to prepare to escape by boat, only to see [Ma Ke] suddenly pick up a gun and aim at him. With a gunshot, [A Cang] fell heavily into the sea.
1:49:16|1:49:28|Afterwards, a large number of police officers arrived by car, while Ma Ke and Zhou Chao kept moving their bodies, crawling towards Zhou Kai. The three of them struggled to lean against each other, and at this moment, Ma Ke slowly spoke.
1:50:0|1:50:24|At this moment, [Brother Ha] suddenly exerted all his strength to press the last button. The Old Ma Bar suddenly exploded, knocking Guo Dui and Lu Lu to the ground with the shockwave. The two then staggered out of the Old Ma Bar. At this moment, the screen displayed the words, "This film is dedicated to loved ones and dear friends."
