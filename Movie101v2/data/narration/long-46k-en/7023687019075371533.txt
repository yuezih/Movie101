0:2:44|0:2:48|Shen Lian felt a tightness in his heart as he watched.
0:2:50|0:3:12|The Tartar refused to give up, urinating towards the bodies of the captives. Holding a bloody knife, the Tartar approached two other captives. [Shen Lian] hesitated behind a huge rock, while Dazi shot an arrow with both hands, hitting the head. Then [Shen Lian] leaped forward and knocked down the Tartar, dodging a kick coming towards him, followed by a vertical strike with a stick.
0:3:12|0:3:23|Shen Lian sneaked behind the Jurchen and executed a reverse throw. As the Jurchen got up, his flying knife was kicked away by Shen Lian's foot. Then, he lunged forward again, stabbing the Jurchen in the heart with a knife. It was only then that the two captives got a clear look at Shen Lian.
0:3:23|0:3:48|He was in the process of cutting open the heart of a Tartar with his knife, when a Tartar emerged from the thick fog with a spear, aiming directly at [Shen Lian]. However, he was knocked down by a prisoner who jumped up, the grieving Tartar reached out to struggle, [Shen Lian] bit off his fingers, and the spear struck the prisoner's head. The Tartar, holding the spear, pressed closer to the fallen prisoner step by step. At a critical moment, [Shen Lian] rushed out with a military knife from the side, stabbing through him. The severely injured Tartar pulled out a dagger from his waist and swung it towards [Shen Lian]'s neck.
0:3:48|0:4:14|[Shen Lian] raised his arm to block, but was overpowered by the strength of the Tartar, the blade pierced into [Shen Lian]'s shoulder. Gritting his teeth, [Shen Lian] turned the blade horizontally, gripping it with both hands and fighting desperately. Blood splattered everywhere for a moment, and [Shen Lian] collapsed on the ground due to exhaustion. The Tartar, however, did not die completely. The other captives on the side were truly frightened. [Shen Lian] used all his strength to pull out the dagger from his shoulder, ignoring the bleeding wound, and first untied the captive next to him.
0:4:14|0:4:23|The hemp rope was easily cut by a military knife, exhausted [Shen Lian] handed the dagger to the captive, who took the knife and stood up to help his colleague untie the ropes.
0:4:40|0:4:57|[Shen Lian] knelt on the ground, holding the wound on his shoulder. The guard with a squinting eye stared at [Shen Lian]. Only then did [Shen Lian] notice him eyeing the water pouch at his waist. He casually took it off and threw it away. Thirsty, he tilted his head back and drank eagerly, even more satisfying than the fine wine.
0:5:0|0:5:23|After quenching his thirst, the guard handed the water bag to his colleague lying on the ground, then turned around and solemnly clasped his hands towards [Shen Lian]. [Shen Lian] returned the gesture, their eyes met, both with a particularly serious expression. The snow continued to fall, yet the sun rose on the horizon, casting a dazzling light on their faces.
0:5:23|0:5:37|[Lu Wenzhao] turned around first and came to the edge of the cliff, looking into the distance at the rising sun. [Shen Lian] followed suit, pausing to look around. As the saying goes, the rising sun breaks through the clouds, and the snow melts away. [Lu Wenzhao] gazed at the millions of rotting corpses.
0:5:53|0:6:2|[Shen Lian] looked at [Lu Wenzhao] and couldn't figure it out for a moment. He turned to look at the endless bodies, his thin and resolute face showing indomitability and arrogance.
0:6:13|0:6:20|Eight years have passed in the blink of an eye. When the dead climbed out of the pile, the once tattered [Shen Lian] is now dressed in the embroidered uniform of the Jin Yiwei.
0:6:20|0:6:40|That night, he brought his men to Ming Xufang in the south of Beijing. In the small Jinling city tower, a big tragedy occurred. [Shen Lian] held a kerosene lamp, looking up and down at the body in front of him. His subordinate holding a torch couldn't help but vomit.
0:7:3|0:7:10|The newcomer was none other than the subordinate he had sent out earlier, [Shen Lian].
0:7:26|0:7:39|The commanding officer here is [Ling Yunkai], the archenemy of [Shen Lian]. [Ling Yunkai] arrives with a large group of soldiers in a menacing manner, and greets them with clasped hands.
0:7:59|0:8:14|[Ling Yunkai] held a small book and, upon hearing that it was a eunuch from the Eastern Depot, quickly stepped forward to inspect. Soon, he recognized the deceased - the eunuch in charge of the seal, which was now lying dead here.
0:8:25|0:8:47|This is [Ling Yunkai], who is preparing to directly challenge [Shen Lian]. [Shen Lian] is obviously a superior, so [Ling Yunkai] does not dare to act rashly. [Ling Yunkai] widens his eyes, looks around in confusion, and earnestly says,
0:9:25|0:9:34|[Shen Lian] dragged the young apprentice out of the kitchen cabinet, while [Ling Yunkai] in the front hall sketched the crime scene on a small notebook with a wolf hair brush.
0:9:52|0:10:5|Yin Cheng's words reached Ling Yunkai's ears. At that moment, Shen Lian was searching for the killer at the back door, while Yin Cheng casually chewed peanuts and drank wine in the main hall.
0:10:47|0:11:3|[Yin Cheng]'s wine glass was smashed, he turned around angrily, only to see it was [Shen Lian]. [Shen Lian] grabbed his collar and pushed him out, leaving the humiliated [Yin Cheng] ignored.
0:11:5|0:11:15|Ling Yunkai blocked the way. His men surrounded Yin Cheng.
0:11:28|0:11:46|[Yin Cheng] looked at [Shen Lian] in panic, while [Shen Lian] glared angrily. Ling Yunkai followed [Yin Cheng]'s gaze and pointed at each one in turn. Ling Yunkai pursed his lips and said displeasedly, reaching out to pat [Yin Cheng]'s shoulder.
0:12:2|0:12:14|Ling Yunkai stared at [Shen Lian] intently. If anyone dared to step forward to rescue her at this moment, they would be labeled as accomplices. As for [Yin Cheng], having his hat removed was one thing, but he was not happy about having his sword taken away.
0:12:23|0:12:59|[Yin Cheng] hurriedly ran out the door, [Shen Lian] watched as [Yin Cheng] fled, thinking about the current strategy, while also warily watching Ling Yunkai approaching slowly. He looked exaggerated, continuing to make things difficult for [Shen Lian]. [Shen Lian]'s brothers behind him couldn't help but feel nervous, and several of his men quickly left this troubled place.
0:13:2|0:13:30|[Yin Cheng] dashed through the crowd with the Jin Yi Wei closely following behind. In the bustling street, [Yin Cheng] casually pushed over a pedestrian carrying a brazier, spilling charcoal all over the ground, slowing down the pursuers. He ran into the alley of taverns, where on both sides of the road were restaurants and inns, with a small river in the middle. During festivals, this place was the liveliest spot. [Yin Cheng] struggled to move forward in the crowd.
0:13:30|0:13:44|With pursuers closing in on both sides, [Yin Cheng] decided to slow down and face them in a battle. The leader of the Jin Yi Wei leaped forward with a kick, but [Yin Cheng] blocked it with his sword, then delivered a punch to the face of the oncoming pursuer, followed by a kick that knocked down three or four more.
0:13:44|0:13:50|Turning around, [Shen Lian] leaped into the pleasure boat and then pushed the boatman into the water. He held a knife to the boatman's neck and urged,
0:13:52|0:14:9|The only boat on the small river was taken by [Yin Cheng], leaving the Jinyiwei on both banks helpless. Seeing this, [Yin Cheng] finally breathed a sigh of relief, adjusted his breathing, and soon the boat sailed out of the bustling area. [Yin Cheng] sat down to rest, leaning on his knife.
0:14:9|0:14:29|As he looked up, he saw a figure of a Jin Yi Wei standing on the small bridge ahead. [Yin Cheng] quickly stood up to prepare for the enemy, but as he approached and saw that it was [Shen Lian] under the moonlight, he suddenly felt the urge to retreat. [Shen Lian] leaped up and executed a powerful move, causing the bow of the boat to rise high and then quickly smash down, creating a huge splash of water.
0:14:29|0:14:51|The embroidered uniform guard [Yin Cheng] also struggled to stabilize his posture, resentment brewing in his heart, fear turning into courage, as he swung his blade down, only to be blocked and pushed back by [Shen Lian]. Unwilling to give up, [Yin Cheng] attempted to advance with his sword, but was ultimately subdued by [Shen Lian], who disarmed him and threw the sword into the lake. The boatman, thinking he was about to be executed, was so frightened that he jumped into the lake and fled.
0:14:56|0:15:10|[Shen Lian], with furrowed brows and glaring eyes, unable to contain his anger, unexpectedly released [Yin Cheng] at this moment. He gazed at the kneeling [Yin Cheng] in front of him, and after a long while, the experienced [Yin Cheng] naturally understood the severity of the situation.
0:15:12|0:15:46|He calmly drew the dagger from his waist, [Yin Cheng] raised the dagger and looked at [Shen Lian] with a determination to die. The small boat drifted slowly along the water, passing under the bridge. The moonlight shimmered on the water inside the arch bridge. [Yin Cheng] firmly turned the dagger around, then with both hands, he stabbed it into his throat. It wasn't over yet, as he desperately cut a gash before finally pulling out the dagger and dropping it.
0:15:46|0:16:4|People fell down one after another, watching as [Yin Cheng] ended his own life. [Shen Lian] felt a sense of chaos in his heart. Just then, [Ling Yunkai] arrived with his men. They all gathered at the railing, perhaps hoping to catch [Shen Lian] in the act of fleeing.
0:16:4|0:16:23|They watched eagerly as the boat sailed out of the bridge, [Shen Lian] sheathed his sword, while [Yin Cheng] lay on the boat, now a corpse, the two men on opposite banks. Among them, [Ling Yunkai] succeeded in his scheme, while [Shen Lian] was tricked and silently took note of it.
0:16:23|0:16:40|In a small pavilion deep in the mountains and forests that day, [Shen Lian] was calculating [Yin Cheng]'s destiny. A monk named Jing Hai opened a package.
0:16:56|0:17:16|[Shen Lian] selected a painting by [Bei Zhai], which depicted a black rooster about to eat a grasshopper. Suddenly, a muffled thunder sounded in the sky, and rain poured down on the pond, getting heavier by the moment. The two did not exchange many words, as the rain in the mountains was unpredictable.
0:17:16|0:17:32|[Shen Lian] simply embarked on the journey home. On the forest path, [Shen Lian] ran a few steps and then stopped to look at the sky, touching the painting, afraid it would get wet again. Seeing there was still a mountain road ahead, he feared it would be difficult to preserve the painting, so he looked down at the pond.
0:17:32|0:17:47|In the reflection, a figure approached, decisively [Shen Lian], drawing his sword. However, upon looking up, he realized that the person was a graceful woman holding an oiled paper umbrella for him. With a slight frown and a smile in the mirror, she shyly revealed her beauty.
0:17:50|0:18:16|With almond-shaped eyes and snow-like cheeks, lips as red as clouds and hair as bright as the moon, [Shen Lian] lowered his eyes and sheathed his sword, then took a closer look. His demeanor was graceful like a startled swan, majestic like a dragon. From afar, he shone like the rising sun at dawn; up close, he was radiant like a lotus emerging from clear water after a light rain, exuding a soft and charming aura. Walking towards him, an old man in a patched robe and a bamboo hat exclaimed,
0:18:48|0:18:58|The girl, not afraid to question back, when these words came out, [Shen Lian]'s fierce eyes, surprisingly, couldn't muster up any sharpness against those tender eyes.
0:18:58|0:19:29|The girl didn't turn around. The thunder sounded, as if urging the two, [Shen Lian] looked up, and the dark clouds dispersed. Sunlight shone through and sprinkled on this mountain forest. The girl's eyes were playful. She closed the umbrella and walked towards another path. [Shen Lian] gazed at her figure and long hair. Only then did he come to his senses. At this first sight, [Shen Lian] couldn't describe the feeling in his heart, only feeling indescribably wonderful.
0:19:29|0:19:44|On one side, a sudden rainstorm is brewing, while on the other side, it has just begun. Grand Secretary Wei Zhongxian is fishing at the Pavilion in the center of the lake near the imperial palace, with hundreds of soldiers standing guard and dozens of civil officials holding documents waiting on the side.
0:20:19|0:20:29|[Lu Wenzhao] hunched over with a fish basket, wearing a flattering expression, while [Wei Zhongxian] in luxurious attire seemed distracted, his eyes vacant and not paying attention to the fish biting the hook.
0:20:29|0:20:50|[Lu Wenzhao] leaned forward to remind [Wei Zhongxian], who was busy with his fishing rod, to engage in a struggle with the fish. However, with a sudden tug, there was no response at all. Getting anxious, [Lu Wenzhao] cautiously approached the water's edge, afraid of splashing water and ruining the enjoyment of the factory owner.
0:20:50|0:21:3|He slowly moved forward in the water, the new robe on his body seemed unimportant now, it was the fish caught by [Chief Zheng] that mattered. He reached out and grabbed the fish that had been hooked, this fish had a big head and struggled fiercely.
0:21:3|0:21:15|Having just come down from the battlefield, [Lu Wenzhao] also struggled to subdue him. Once on shore, [Lu Wenzhao] knelt in front of [Chief Zheng], offering the fish with both hands, but [Chief Zheng] casually threw it away.
0:21:18|0:21:54|[Lu Wenzhao] gasped and said seriously, [Wei Zhongxian] looked empty-eyed and weak, before [Lu Wenzhao] could speak, [Chief Zheng] gave him a cold look. [Lu Wenzhao] lowered his head, dared not speak, and did not expect any tasks.
0:22:6|0:22:40|[Lu Wenzhao] immediately beamed with joy, [Chief Zheng] stood up, and the two eunuchs behind him dragged the court robes to clear a path through the crowd. As [Wei Zhongxian] was escorted back to the sedan chair, [Lu Wenzhao], who was still kneeling in place, caught sight of the fish and couldn't help but smile. Back at the mansion, [Lu Wenzhao] devoured the fish, then set down his chopsticks and picked up a brush to draw a cross on [Yin Cheng]'s nameplate.
0:23:48|0:24:6|After that, [Shen Lian] pushed open the door of the cabin in the woods and hurried away. Although they were usually adversaries, at this moment they were partners. The Jinyiwei were meticulous in their work, and the two of them, one in front and one behind, effectively blocked the entrance to the cabin. [Shen Lian] circled around to the back of the house, drew his sword, pried open a window, and caught a glimpse of a figure.
0:24:10|0:24:41|Seeing [Ling Yunkai] has broken in, [Shen Lian] hides in the room from the window. The two coordinate with each other, one in the light and one in the dark. [Shen Lian] checks the wardrobe and bed, then crosses over to the tea table and picks up a red seal. Walking over, [Shen Lian] tosses the seal to [Ling Yunkai]. Hearing this, [Ling Yunkai] places the long knife on the table. Behind him stands the painter known as [Bei Zhai]. When [Shen Lian] turns around, she recognizes her as the woman who handed him the umbrella earlier.
0:24:41|0:25:8|[Ling Yunkai] pinched [Bei Zhai]'s chin, then stamped the seal with his bad breath on her face. Mr. [Bei Zhai], who was insulted, immediately shed tears. [Ling Yunkai] held a knife to [Bei Zhai]'s neck, frightening her to shrink back and dodge. Her tender white neck was particularly alluring, and her delicate body wrapped in a light-colored dress couldn't help but tremble. [Ling Yunkai] had evil intentions.
0:25:8|0:25:22|He put away the knife, grabbed [Bei Zhai], pinched her neck and walked towards the inner room. [Bei Zhai] looked weak with tears on one side of her face and a red mark on the other, looking particularly pitiful. Her eyes, filled with pleading, were fixed on [Shen Lian].
0:25:32|0:25:50|[Ling Yunkai] threw him onto the bed, flipping him over. [Bei Zhai] struggled but was no match for this man. [Ling Yunkai] received a slap, then fiercely slapped back. [Shen Lian] turned away, unable to bear it.
0:25:52|0:26:7|[Bei Zhai] was about to be stripped of his thin clothes, a steel knife was placed on [Ling Yunkai]'s shoulder. [Ling Yunkai] turned around to dodge and climbed down from the bed. The steel knife remained close to [Ling Yunkai]'s neck.
0:26:16|0:26:47|The two stood facing each other, with [Bei Zhai] struggling to sit up on the bed and looking over. [Shen Lian] gazed at her with concern. The perceptive [Ling Yunkai] noticed the clues between the two. [Shen Lian] was clearly not good at lying. [Ling Yunkai] bypassed the uneasy [Shen Lian] and patted him on the shoulder. Afraid of causing trouble, [Shen Lian] followed [Ling Yunkai] to the outer room, only to find him bent over the Book of Life and Death, reading aloud.
0:26:52|0:26:56|[Shen Lian] raised his sword and shouted, causing [Ling Yunkai], who was complacent, to startle at the sudden move.
0:26:59|0:27:19|[Ling Yunkai] grabbed the blade of [Shen Lian] and menacingly said, [Shen Lian] felt a bit guilty, as [Ling Yunkai] took the knife and threw it on the table. [Ling Yunkai] kept pressing closer, slapping [Shen Lian]'s cheek and pushing him away.
0:27:19|0:27:45|[Bei Zhai] was peeking at the door at some point, [Shen Lian] frowned and saw [Ling Yunkai] looking fearless. He realized that the situation might not end well, so he prepared to confront him. [Ling Yunkai] picked up the Book of Life and Death, stuffed it into his chest in front of [Shen Lian], and then arrogantly patted it through his clothes.
0:27:45|0:28:11|Outside the window, thunder and rain were raging, but the atmosphere inside the room was no less intense. [Shen Lian] stepped forward to retrieve something, only to be pushed away by [Ling Yunkai]. In the scuffle, [Ling Yunkai] landed a punch on [Shen Lian]'s face. Caught off guard, [Shen Lian] had to step back, holding his face. After a moment to collect himself, he suddenly struck back, slamming his hands down. [Ling Yunkai], not one to back down, blocked the attack with his arms, then swiftly grabbed one of [Shen Lian]'s arms and twisted him into submission.
0:28:11|0:28:23|With another kick, Shen Lian, who was just getting up, was kicked again by Ling Yunkai. Seizing the opportunity, Ling Yunkai drew out the embroidered spring knife. Seeing the opponent brandishing the icy blade, Shen Lian moved forward, dodged Ling Yunkai's attack, and tried to pick up his own knife.
0:28:25|0:28:45|Who would have expected that [Ling Yunkai] would flick the knife into the water tank, his stabbing and slashing attacks were swift, while [Shen Lian] countered by evading and striking in one fluid motion. [Ling Yunkai] seized the opportunity to throw [Shen Lian] over his shoulder and then attempted to stab him with the knife. [Shen Lian] dodged up close and used a move called "rabbit kicking the soldier" to kick him away, flipping over the table. He then took the chance to catch his breath.
0:28:45|0:29:7|[Ling Yunkai] stood up and delivered a horizontal kick, [Shen Lian] somersaulted, with the back of his thigh holding the hilt, snatching the Embroidered Spring Knife. With a blade of ice in hand, [Shen Lian] swiftly turned his attack, placing the knife against [Ling Yunkai]'s neck. Gritting his teeth, [Shen Lian] punched [Ling Yunkai] away, but the latter relentlessly threw calligraphy at [Shen Lian], only to be kicked and thrown into a corner by [Shen Lian], who then leaped forward with another kick.
0:29:7|0:29:15|[Ling Yunkai] dodges quickly, pulls out a dagger and slashes towards [Shen Lian]. [Shen Lian] dodges left and right, seizes the opportunity to grab a pair of scissors. The irrational [Ling Yunkai] stabs wildly, but with no technique.
0:29:15|0:29:41|[Shen Lian] picked up the scissors and stabbed, then delivered an elbow strike to knock [Ling Yunkai] away. Just as [Ling Yunkai] by the water tank got up, [Shen Lian] pressed him back into the water. Seeing the steel knife from before in the water, [Ling Yunkai] hesitated. [Shen Lian] released him, and [Ling Yunkai] drew the long knife from the water to slash [Shen Lian]'s abdomen. Seizing the opportunity, he pursued, but his arm was caught by [Shen Lian] as he tried to strike back, and once again he was pushed into the water.
0:29:41|0:29:52|Perhaps out of instinct, [Shen Lian] skillfully cut open the artery of [Ling Yunkai] with scissors. Even he himself was taken aback, and he quickly stepped forward to check on [Ling Yunkai]'s condition.
0:29:54|0:30:22|Seeing no response even after dragging him out, [Shen Lian] panicked. He accidentally killed [Wei Zhongxian]'s nephew. Lightning struck timely across the sky, startling the onlooker [Bei Zhai]. She hurriedly fled into the room, leaving [Shen Lian] to react and chase after her. Despite his injuries, he agilely leaped out of the window and pursued [Bei Zhai] through the muddy ground.
0:30:22|0:30:44|The wound on his abdomen was still bleeding, [Shen Lian] almost slipped and fell, he chased out of the alley holding his stomach but couldn't see [Bei Zhai]'s figure. Killing the Chief Banner was already enough trouble for him, not to mention being related to [Wei Zhongxian]. This situation was hard to handle. Now [Shen Lian] could only take it one step at a time. The next day,
0:31:13|0:31:38|In the small courtyard of [Bei Zhai], it was bustling with Jinyiwei. Faced with Commander [Lu Wenzhao], he had to tell a lie first. But as he sat dryly at the stone table, he suddenly felt a malicious gaze. The sensitive [Shen Lian] stared with his sharp eyes, and the man with his legs crossed in the distance, nibbling on a snack, stood up when he saw [Shen Lian] looking over, accompanied by a young officer with a sword.
0:31:38|0:31:44|[Shen Lian] had a premonition of trouble when the person sat opposite him so brazenly.
0:31:59|0:32:28|[Shen Lian] frowned and pondered for a moment, giving a look of confusion. [Shen Lian]'s indifferent appearance amused [Pei Lun], who then got up and walked into the room. [Shen Lian] remained silent for a while, then turned around. The game between the two had officially begun.
0:32:28|0:32:35|Entering the room, [Pei Lun] pushed aside [Ling Yunkai]'s collar to check the wound, as answered by [Shen Lian].
0:32:39|0:32:53|[Pei Lun] looked thoughtful for a moment, then smiled. He stood up and took out the Book of Life and Death from his robe. A junior officer beside him bent down and offered a wolf hair brush. [Pei Lun] took the dry brush and actually sharpened it on the junior officer's tongue.
0:32:57|0:33:15|The sergeant led the men into the room for a search. [Pei Lun] gave [Shen Lian] a harmless smile, while [Pei Lun] checked the signs of a fight in the room. Suddenly, he found [Bei Zhai]'s seal on the floor beside the bed, chuckled lightly, and bent down to pick it up.
0:33:22|0:33:28|The junior officer approached and whispered a report to [Shen Lian], who impatiently responded.
0:33:37|0:33:54|[Shen Lian] recalled that after [Ling Yunkai] died, he took out the Book of Life and Death and put it into the fire, burning it clean. [Shen Lian] gestured towards the ground where [Ling Yunkai] lay. [Pei Lun] chuckled lightly, but just as he was about to start writing, he suddenly caught a whiff of fragrance. [Shen Lian] didn't say anything, but he was greatly shocked in his heart.
0:34:38|0:34:59|In the end, staring fiercely at [Shen Lian], the situation just came to an end. [Shen Lian] walked through the street bridge back to his residence. Unconsciously, finding [Bei Zhai] had become the most urgent matter at hand. Just as [Shen Lian] was about to open the door, he noticed a black cat nestling at his feet. He brought the cat inside, and the cat happily ran around in the courtyard.
0:34:59|0:35:16|At noon, [Shen Lian] sat at the door eating pickles and steamed buns, stroking the furry cat. The cat in front of him ran towards the corridor, catching [Shen Lian]'s attention to the letter delivered by arrow. He took down the arrow, looked around, saw nothing unusual, and then opened the letter.
0:35:19|0:35:24|The Ming Code states that those who kill the Jinyiwei are guilty of conspiracy and shall be executed along with their families. At the hour of the dog (7-9pm), at the Cloud Perch Slope in the West Mountain.
0:35:24|0:35:55|Just as [Shen Lian], who had just settled down, was about to sit down, he had to take risks again. It seemed that the only witness, [Bei Zhai], had already been controlled and taken away by someone. At the hour of the dog, the moon shone on the Cloud Perching Slope of the West Mountain. [Shen Lian] arrived as scheduled and heard a flute playing. A figure wearing a hood sat on a strange rock in the bamboo forest, playing the flute. [Shen Lian] cautiously approached step by step with a knife in hand, carefully observing this messenger.
0:35:55|0:36:5|Upon closer inspection, it was a spirited and heroic woman. Without saying a word, she suddenly turned around, leaped over the rocks, and fled into the depths of the bamboo forest.
0:36:5|0:36:28|[Shen Lian] hurriedly chased after, as it was rare to have news of [Bei Zhai]. Regardless, he had to meet up. The two rushed down the bamboo forest on the hillside, obviously the other party was very familiar with this terrain, and quickly found the sloping path in the forest, sliding down. This was a pre-prepared escape route. Even from a high point, [Shen Lian] could only quicken his pace. Even if there was an ambush ahead, he had to take the risk.
0:36:28|0:36:34|[Shen Lian] leaped forward with his sword and struck down, the blade fiercely chopping onto the woman's back, but a metallic clang was heard.
0:36:34|0:36:54|The woman stopped and reached behind for the metal shield. She took off the shield and drew out a short knife from underneath. Then she rubbed the shield hard, making a sound that was not like any ordinary weapon.
0:36:54|0:37:10|And behind [Shen Lian] came a middle-aged man playing with a wolf's teeth club, while a woman in green clothes walked beside him with a sword in hand. Her hair was neatly tied behind her head, with high eyebrows and sharp features, showing no signs of weakness. Yet, she exuded a restrained heroic spirit, a female swordsman.
0:37:50|0:38:22|In the midst of the forest, with the night wind howling, a sense of chivalry soars. Tensions rise, as schemes and plots brew in the shadows. Amidst the glint of blades and the shadows of swords, [Shen Lian] raises his steel sword, wiping it clean. In the dense bamboo forest, moonlight gently falls on the blade, determination gleaming in his eyes as the aura of battle gathers around him. The wolf-toothed club swiftly thrusts forward, [Shen Lian] sidesteps to intercept, the opponent then pulls back the club to deflect the steel sword, and in one fluid motion, swings back.
0:38:22|0:38:29|Shen Lian is smashed and thrown into a bamboo pole.
0:38:34|0:38:57|Shen Lian became alert and realized that the group of thieves was extraordinary. He quickly adopted a defensive stance with his sword in front of him. However, the female swordsman noticed the trick. Shen Lian pretended to run sideways, and as the two caught up, he turned back and attacked the female swordsman. Their weapons clashed, and Shen Lian was sent flying, landing beside a woman named Ding Chong.
0:38:57|0:39:13|The iron club came charging again, [Shen Lian] caught [Ding Chong] and took the blow for him. Seizing the opportunity, he pulled out his hand crossbow, running and shooting at the same time. The arrows pierced the opponent's thigh and then arm. [Shen Lian] rushed towards the female warrior, while his two disciples hurriedly reminded him.
0:39:15|0:39:32|[Shen Lian] wielded the might of thousands of soldiers as she struck down, the female swordsman closed her eyes to heighten her senses, suddenly drew her sword, the blades clashed, the female swordsman pulled the sword horizontally, flipped her wrist and struck down, [Shen Lian]'s sword was unexpectedly cut in one blow, in the blink of an eye, she placed the sword at [Shen Lian]'s neck, revealing a confident smile.
0:39:44|0:40:3|Hearing this, the female swordsman put away her sword and the half-kneeling [Shen Lian] finally stood up. The agreement between the two was reached, and in order to get back [Bei Zhai], [Shen Lian] had to take a risk. That day, heavy guards were stationed in front of the document library door.
0:40:22|0:40:30|The other party checked the identity and handed back both hands. [Shen Lian] took the token and headed straight for the table key, alarming the guards on the spot.
0:40:40|0:41:1|[Shen Lian] turned back unhappily, the newcomer was Chief Zheng from the Eastern Depot, accompanied by [Lu Wenzhao], Captain [Lu Wenzhao] gestured with his hand, [Shen Lian] tactfully made way.
0:41:23|0:41:33|[Lu Wenzhao] humbly bowed his body to escort, the arrogant Chief Zheng walked with his head held high, [Shen Lian] reluctantly handed over the key.
0:41:39|0:42:1|Chief Zheng walked in, and [Lu Wenzhao] turned his face full of smiles slowly. The smile on his face disappeared, replaced by a look of resentment. He walked out straight, and [Shen Lian] followed [Lu Wenzhao] in a hurry, pushing [Shen Lian] angrily.
0:42:5|0:42:31|Like a big brother, although there is dissatisfaction, at this moment still caring for [Shen Lian], deeply trapped in a dilemma, [Shen Lian] is also feeling a bit embarrassed. In the temple, the monk serves the meal, the young monk trembles as he presents the meal to the two Jinyiwei officials. Monk Jing Hai takes the tray, the young monk retreats fearfully. Jing Hai serves the meal to [Pei Lun], who sniffs the vegetarian meal.
0:42:33|0:42:59|In the spacious room, with over a dozen people present, only [Pei Lun] could be heard chewing on the pickled vegetables. He savored the sweetness of the vegetarian meal and happily shared his joy with the junior officer sitting across from him.
0:43:21|0:43:28|Jing Hai's expression changed suddenly, and he became tense immediately.
0:43:48|0:43:58|The scribe glanced at Jing Hai, who was recording, and Pei Lun, who was eating, also stopped. Jing Hai realized he had misspoken, and the scribe looked at Pei Lun with a questioning gaze.
0:44:8|0:44:34|The young officer wrote while reciting, intimidating the frail monk. Anxious Jing Hai pointed at the Book of Impermanence but dared not speak, seeking help from [Pei Lun]. [Pei Lun] set down his chopsticks, glaring displeased at the young officer. The young officer quickly lowered his head, offering up the written record. [Pei Lun] snatched it, leaned back in his chair, squinted his eyes, and casually glanced over it.
0:44:35|0:44:44|One playing the good cop, one playing the bad cop, Jing Hai, who has never faced a storm before, suddenly felt uneasy.
0:44:46|0:45:11|[Pei Lun] tore up the transcript and threw the notebook back, the paper torn into pieces by him. [Pei Lun] took out his pipe, and the little flag beside him lit it up for him. [Pei Lun] smoked contentedly, looking at Jing Hai. At this moment, the once calm and composed Jing Hai was now visibly frightened.
0:45:11|0:45:43|In the afternoon at an inn, the mysterious female warrior known as [Ding Baiying] observed the situation and closed the window. Beside her, [Bei Zhai] was arranging the thatched bed. She brought a blanket, and after a moment of contemplation, [Ding Baiying] lowered her head. [Bei Zhai] stopped his work and sighed softly, "Unsociable" [Ding Baiying] went out, and saw that figure.
0:45:45|0:46:18|[Shen Lian] hurried back home, closed the doors and windows, and pulled out a half-cut-off sword. He carefully examined the blade, then walked to the ancestral tablet in the house. Opening the long box on the table, he found a precious sword inside. He held it up with both hands, the blade and hilt cast as one, the tip of the sword sharp and shining.
0:46:20|0:46:51|Now the precious sword is sheathed, the light rain of the night has just passed, the ground is not yet dry, the patrolling soldiers are lined up neatly, with a solemn military appearance, conducting routine inspections around the archives. [Shen Lian], hiding behind the wall, holds a stick of agarwood, estimating the time. After speaking, [Shen Lian] pulls up his mask. The soldiers on the street gradually move away, and [Shen Lian] also puts on his backpack and starts to move. He is extremely cautious, running while observing his surroundings.
0:46:51|0:47:11|Shen Lian then ran with a burst of energy, taking a big step onto the horse hitch and leaping over the high wall. As he landed gracefully, he ran to the door, took out his tools, and pried it open. The night fell upon this magnificent and grand attic. Shen Lian walked briskly inside, casually lighting a stick of incense in the censer for timing.
0:47:11|0:47:36|He observed the layout of the document room, slowly took off his mask, his eyes fierce and resolute. Then he took off his backpack and started pouring wine. [Shen Lian], who was meticulous from start to finish, poured a circle. After doing all this, he took out a fire starter. Just as he was about to set fire, he saw his reflection in the spilled water and suddenly remembered something?
0:47:50|0:47:58|In a moment of distraction, a spark quietly fell, and [Shen Lian] quickly reached out to catch it, when suddenly a strange event occurred outside the door.
0:48:2|0:48:11|Late at night, [Chief Zheng] inexplicably found himself in the archives, unaware that [Shen Lian] was searching for documents about the emperor's treasure ship.
0:48:12|0:48:26|He quickly found the record of the treasure ship construction, and immediately started flipping through it. [Chief Zheng] also entered the gate of the document storage yard, although he did not detect the scent in the corner, but this smell caught his attention.
0:48:26|0:49:3|The suspicious Chief Zheng walked quickly towards the document room, Shen Lian grabbed a document and flipped through it absentmindedly. Before he could confirm his thoughts, there was a commotion outside. He extinguished the candle in his hand and hurried to the window, crouching down to peer outside through the crack, only to see an empty courtyard.
0:49:4|0:49:22|Turning back to look at the incense burner, the incense was already more than half burned. Shen Lian, who had received the document, gave up setting fire to the archives, put on a mask, and quickly walked out the door. But before he had taken two steps, he found himself being watched. Chief Zheng, who was discovered behind the lamp post, walked out slowly.
0:49:34|0:49:58|[Shen Lian] heard the fast footsteps and ran straight towards the gate. [Chief Zheng], who had anticipated this, blocked his way. [Shen Lian] dodged and escaped again. Suddenly, a fiery evil wind attacked towards the back of his head. He had to crouch and dodge. [Chief Zheng] took advantage of this and rushed in, a flying kick missed, but closed the distance. The two engaged in close combat, with [Chief Zheng] aiming for the face mask. The spiked gloves lifted [Shen Lian]'s mask several times. [Shen Lian] tried to block but was caught by him.
0:49:58|0:50:28|Shen Lian was pushed and pulled by Chief Zheng, and before catching his breath, the fire meteor came again. Shen Lian was forced to retreat continuously until he reached the wall, where he had to draw his sword. Chief Zheng swung the fire meteor at Shen Lian, who dodged and it hit the wall. Chief Zheng used his knee and leg to strike repeatedly, while Shen Lian kicked up sand and stones towards Chief Zheng, taking the opportunity to escape. Little did he know that the fire meteor was coming even faster.
0:50:28|0:50:42|[Shen Lian] dodged, a sword struck the iron chain of the fire meteor, [Chief Zheng] turned around and raised his hand to hook, the arm naturally couldn't twist past the thigh. The hooked fire meteor smashed into [Shen Lian]'s chest, unable to get up in time, [Shen Lian] rolled to the side, dodging another blow.
0:50:42|0:51:3|Taking advantage of Chief Zheng's just finished move, Shen Lian leaped and kicked horizontally. The opponent had to turn his head to dodge. Shen Lian engaged in close combat, but Chief Zheng blew a flame from the hollow meteor, sparks flying everywhere. Shen Lian had to crouch and dodge, almost being exposed by Chief Zheng. Shen Lian re-tied her veil, while Chief Zheng swung the iron chain to release the meteor, which was caught by Shen Lian this time.
0:51:3|0:51:13|Chief Zheng lunged forward to grab the steel ball on the other end of the meteor hammer, but missed. Instead, sparks flew off the wall as he tried to hit [Shen Lian]. Just as Shen Lian was about to escape, he was struck solidly by the fire meteor hammer, knocking over the lamp post in the courtyard.
0:51:13|0:51:39|[Shen Lian] fled to the document room, but [Chief Zheng] was a step behind. Unable to climb through the window, he used the fire meteor on his foot to smash open the front door. Inside the room, [Chief Zheng] searched but found no trace of [Shen Lian]. He prepared himself for an ambush, lifting the hollow meteor and blowing on it to use the sparks to survey the surroundings. Suddenly, from the shadows, [Shen Lian] leaped down.
0:51:39|0:51:46|Chief Zheng was caught off guard and his helmet was split open, causing a spark to ignite the alcohol on the ground.
0:51:46|0:52:1|In an instant, the fire spread rapidly, shocking the two with the scene before them. [Shen Lian] shot a cold arrow, narrowly missing Chief Zheng who dodged it. The arrow ended up stuck in the bookshelf behind. With a pull, Shen Lian brought down the bookshelf, narrowly avoiding hitting Chief Zheng.
0:52:2|0:52:9|He kept knocking down bookshelves one after another, while Chief Zheng threw out a fire meteor hammer, but it got entangled firmly on the bookshelf.
0:52:9|0:52:34|He picked up the steel ball at the end and attacked, [Shen Lian] used the force to strike, nailing it into the bookshelf. However, [Chief Zheng] lifted the veil, [Shen Lian] chopped at the chief's wrist guard with a knife. Seeing the situation was not good, [Chief Zheng] ran away, [Shen Lian] grabbed the fire meteor and chased after. The guards outside the door came for another patrol, [Chief Zheng] stumbled out with support, and as the incense at the door was about to burn out, [Chief Zheng] was just a step away from the door.
0:52:34|0:52:38|As soon as he opened the door, a fire meteor immediately flew in and hit the back of his head.
0:52:38|0:53:3|[Shen Lian] caught Chief Zheng who fell to the ground, then gently closed the outer door. The guards who were inspecting in line did not notice anything unusual. [Shen Lian] was needlessly alarmed. When he turned around, he saw Chief Zheng on the ground foaming at the mouth. Meanwhile, the fire in the document room nearby was getting fiercer. It was not safe to stay there for long.
0:53:4|0:53:29|On this clear morning, [Shen Lian] walked through the streets and alleys to the newly opened Qingfeng Teahouse. His destination was naturally the appointment with [Ding Baiying]. As he entered, she was seated on the grandmaster's chair, [Ding Baiying] raised her hand in a gesture. Suddenly, a dozen henchmen appeared in the teahouse, including the border general [Ding Tai] and the female disciple [Ding Chong].
0:53:45|0:53:56|In the inner room, [Bei Zhai] peered through the crack to observe the situation in the hall. [Ding Baiying] stood up, picked up the dagger beside him,
0:54:8|0:54:32|Shen Lian, a member of the Embroidered Uniform Guard, sensed there was another mastermind behind the scenes. Ding Baiying, no longer wasting words, drew her precious sword, and her subordinates were also ready to act. After some consideration, Ding Baiying didn't dare to take the risk and had to retract her sword. Leaving the teahouse, Shen Lian walked through the bustling streets and headed straight home.
0:54:32|0:54:46|But as soon as he entered, the black cat in the courtyard became restless. The docile cat arched its back and howled towards the inner room. [Shen Lian] became alert. He entered the room, looked around, and saw nothing unusual.
0:54:48|0:54:56|Close the door, holding a knife, walked towards the room, where [Pei Lun] and [Bei Zhai] were actually drinking tea.
0:55:21|0:55:39|[Shen Lian] couldn't bear to see [Bei Zhai] leave like this. The plain bowl of white noodles was delicious to [Pei Lun], who ate it all up, soup and noodles, and then comfortably set down the bowl and chopsticks.
0:56:15|0:56:34|[Pei Lun] pushed the note to [Shen Lian], who picked it up from the table and opened it for inspection. It read, "Mingshifang Jinling Building, waiting for the official. Signed not by others, but by the present Mr. [Bei Zhai]."
0:57:3|0:57:11|[Shen Lian] couldn't help but feel nervous, as this painting is now the ironclad evidence of the party's conspiracy.
0:57:48|0:58:1|[Pei Lun] stood up unhappily, carrying a knife, and strode out of the room until he reached the gate. As soon as he took a step forward, [Shen Lian] hurried to catch up, while [Bei Zhai] on the side finally breathed a sigh of relief.
0:58:36|0:59:7|[Shen Lian] recalled that night, feeling a sudden loss of anger. He guiltily pursed his lips, lowered his brows, and stopped making eye contact with [Pei Lun]. With a cold laugh, [Pei Lun] turned and strode out the door. [Shen Lian] clenched his teeth and returned to the inner room, determined to find the mastermind behind these two cases. He dragged [Bei Zhai] into the study, only to find the once tidy room now in chaos. [Shen Lian] asked,
0:59:8|0:59:21|[Bei Zhai] tossed her hair back and spoke arrogantly, which immediately ignited the anger of [Shen Lian]. [Shen Lian] had ways to deal with her.
0:59:23|0:59:32|On the lake, [Shen Lian] sits in front of a small fishing boat, tying [Bei Zhai]'s feet to the anchor and tearing off the seal on [Bei Zhai]'s mouth.
1:0:23|1:0:38|[Shen Lian] kicked the anchor off the ship, then drew the Embroidered Spring Knife. The anchor's hemp rope slid rapidly down as [Bei Zhai] embraced death with a sense of homecoming.
1:0:42|1:0:48|With tears welling up in his eyes, [Bei Zhai] looked resolute, displaying a righteous and determined demeanor.
1:0:53|1:1:26|The coiled rope was pulled down with a swish, dragging [Bei Zhai] into the water with the anchor. [Shen Lian] stared straight ahead, his eyes filled with determination as he glared at the cabin. Gradually calming his inner turmoil, [Shen Lian] furrowed his brow, dissatisfied with the outcome. With a leap and a knife in hand, he plunged into the lake, vigorously swimming downstream with outstretched arms. The sunlight illuminated the lake water, and he searched for [Bei Zhai]'s figure.
1:1:26|1:1:37|Finally, separated by a dreamlike bubble, it seemed like he saw her, so he wielded his sword and paddled over with all his might. At this moment, [Bei Zhai] had his eyes closed, his hair disheveled, as if he were asleep.
1:1:37|1:2:2|[Shen Lian] approached and took her arm, heading upstream. Before long, [Bei Zhai] was rescued onto the boat. [Shen Lian] helped her lie down slowly in the cabin. He looked at the unconscious [Bei Zhai] and couldn't say anything. In the afternoon, the two sat in the cabin by the shore.
1:2:25|1:2:33|[Shen Lian] frowned, feeling a bit guilty in his heart.
1:2:38|1:2:44|[Bei Zhai] sat with knees drawn up, gazing into the distance at the lake.
1:2:57|1:3:11|On the side of the Northern Pacification Commissioner, [Lu Wenzhao] hurriedly arrived. Upon entering, the Jin Yiwei inside were in low spirits and dared not lift their heads, while several captains also looked dejected.
1:3:15|1:3:25|The Deputy Commander Bei Zhai gestured for Lu Wenzhao to check on Chief Zheng's condition. On the makeshift bed, Chief Zheng's face was pale and his neck was covered in bruises.
1:3:44|1:3:56|Bei Zhai slapped away the tea brought by Qianhu Jinglai with one palm, and Lu Wenzhao noticed that Chief Zheng's lips seemed to be moving. He stepped forward, leaned in, and listened carefully.
1:4:3|1:4:39|The Lord Commander lifted [Lu Wenzhao]'s head and leaned in to listen, but unfortunately, [Chief Zheng] had already fallen into a deep coma and couldn't hear anything. [Bei Zhai] stared intently at [Lu Wenzhao], who remained composed and acted convincingly. Realizing that the person had suffered brain damage, [Bei Zhai] didn't expect to find any clues. Inside the case files, the Jinyiwei were busy cleaning up the aftermath. [Pei Lun] picked up a piece of paper from the ground and examined it, furrowing his brow as he pondered something.
1:4:39|1:4:43|He picked up the scroll and found [Lu Wenzhao].
1:5:18|1:5:51|[Lu Wenzhao] listened, couldn't help but purse his lips, nodded with deep emotion, and reached out to straighten [Pei Lun]'s collar. Descending from the roof was none other than [Ding Baiying]—accompanied by her two disciples [Ding Chong] and [Ding Tai]. [Pei Lun] was no pushover either, turning around with a proud look and drawing his sword. Before he could finish his sentence, he was stabbed in the back by [Lu Wenzhao].
1:5:51|1:6:18|[Pei Lun] turned around in pain, weakly swung his knife, easily dodged by [Lu Wenzhao]. He covered his wound, looked at the blood on his hand, stared angrily and puzzledly at [Lu Wenzhao]. [Pei Lun] turned to look at [Ding Baiying], [Ding Chong] reacted to the sound, leaped up and kicked horizontally. [Pei Lun] dodged by shrinking his head, but was hit by a shield, then lunged forward and collided with [Ding Tai]'s wolf-toothed club, spitting blood on the spot.
1:6:19|1:6:36|The two of them moved back and forth, cooperating with each other. The heavily injured [Pei Lun] couldn't hold on any longer, spitting out blood under pressure. He struggled to prop himself up, and [Ding Tai] approached, wielding his wolf's teeth club high. On this night,
1:6:59|1:7:9|He grasped an important clue all of a sudden, stood up from the cabin, vaguely discerned the monstrous conspiracy to assassinate the emperor, and realized that the mastermind behind the scenes was playing a big game.
1:7:9|1:7:19|[Bei Zhai], [Lu Wenzhao], and [Ding Baiying] must be like grasshoppers on the same line. As for whether they know each other privately and what their relationship is, that remains unknown.
1:7:19|1:7:44|[Shen Lian] looked at [Bei Zhai] on the stone steps, his mind filled with thoughts. Faced with [Shen Lian], [Bei Zhai] also felt extremely conflicted, so he could only turn his head away and look upstream at the river. At that moment, a figure could be vaguely seen in the distance, floating down the river. [Bei Zhai] stood up to get a better look, while [Shen Lian] hurried over. The figure turned out to be the miraculously survived [Pei Lun]. Back in the house, the two took care of [Pei Lun].
1:7:44|1:7:48|The wolf's teeth club left a bloody hole in him.
1:7:48|1:8:7|At that moment, Ding Tai smashed down with all his might. Pei Lun had to roll over to avoid it, but before he could run a few steps, he was chased down again. With a kick, he was knocked down. Just as Ding Tai was about to end the fight, Pei Lun swiftly shot out a hidden sleeve sword, stabbing into Ding Tai's neck. Ding Baiying rushed forward to support his disciple, but when he looked up again, Pei Lun had already taken the opportunity to escape.
1:8:7|1:8:21|The room was pale, and Pei Lun, sweating profusely, suddenly opened his eyes, ready to defend himself, only to find Shen Lian helping him lie down slowly, while Bei Zhai stood by with medicine powder, calm as a cicada.
1:8:30|1:9:4|[Pei Lun] looked around in confusion and pain, while [Bei Zhai] was extremely afraid of this Jinyiwei, focusing on treating the wounds. Upon hearing this, [Bei Zhai] couldn't help but look towards [Shen Lian]. Despite being seriously injured, [Pei Lun] perked up upon hearing [Bei Zhai], raising his eyebrows and drooping his eyelids in disbelief. Suddenly, there was a commotion outside the door.
1:9:4|1:9:20|[Shen Lian] locked the door and walked out, only to find his immediate superior [Lu Wenzhao] standing in the courtyard. Fully aware of the situation, [Shen Lian] approached slowly.
1:10:8|1:10:17|[Lu Wenzhao] walked over with a displeased look in his eyes, while [Shen Lian] remained resolute, not giving an inch.
1:11:0|1:11:5|Shen Lian looked at the hand resting on his shoulder by Lu Wenzhao and was momentarily speechless.
1:11:18|1:11:34|[Shen Lian] caught the key detail, indicating that the master behind must have a deep affection for [Bei Zhai]. Such an embarrassing statement unexpectedly came from [Shen Lian].
1:11:34|1:12:1|The cunning [Lu Wenzhao] drew his sword, facing off against [Shen Lian], who just stared back without making a move. With different principles, they couldn't collaborate. Though filled with resentment, [Lu Wenzhao] couldn't voice it out. Frustrated, he quickened his pace, sheathed his sword, and left the house. [Shen Lian], however, remained vigilant, looking up at the wall. Suddenly, a soldier with a musket appeared on the wall.
1:12:3|1:12:19|[Shen Lian] decisively crouched down to dodge, the gunpowder scattered in the small courtyard filled the air recklessly. [Shen Lian] dared not raise his head as he lay behind the small garden surrounded by giant rocks, while soldiers outside took turns clearing the accumulated explosives in the muskets.
1:12:19|1:12:50|Seemingly determined to level this house to the ground, [Lu Wenzhao] turned his back, his eyes vacant and silent. The black cat on the tree was hit and fell, suppressed by firepower. [Shen Lian], who was anxiously waiting, had a heart as anxious as fire. This cat had accompanied him through many difficult moments. Suddenly, the gunfire stopped, but [Shen Lian] still dared not delay. Peering through the branches, he saw no trace of the soldiers.
1:12:50|1:12:57|Soldiers carrying long spears burst in through the door. [Shen Lian] quickly picked up the black cat and fled into the house, but before he could push the door closed, the soldiers forcefully pushed it open.
1:12:57|1:13:20|Fortunately, he had prepared in advance by sprinkling gunpowder on the door frame. He cut the rope, knocked over the lamp stand, and the raging fire formed a barrier. Seizing the opportunity, he entered the inner room, lifted the kang head partition, and prepared to enter the underground passage. Before leaving, he couldn't bear to lightly stroke the black cat. The front room had already been burned down. [Shen Lian] called out, and only in this secret passage, [Bei Zhai] held the lamp, supporting the seriously injured [Pei Lun]. The three of them quickly fled.
1:13:21|1:13:51|On this stormy night with lightning flashing across the sky, the night watchmen on the streets rode their horses wildly, but no one expected that [Shen Lian] and his group would escape into the Jinling Tower. At this moment, he was holding a lamp, pondering over the situation. He casually flipped through the Shipbuilding Records lying on a simple mat, and immediately recognized [Pei Lun]. When he woke up, [Shen Lian] blew out the lamp, glanced at the sleeping [Bei Zhai], and then tucked the Shipbuilding Records into his arms before lying down peacefully.
1:13:53|1:14:22|The rain fell as night descended on the capital city. A hand was just pulled out of Shen Lian's arms, holding the monitoring book. Shen Lian firmly grabbed the wrist, lifting the lamp to take a look, only to find it was Bei Zhai. Shen Lian pushed her hand away, and Pei Lun joined in the commotion. Shen Lian glared at him fiercely, causing Pei Lun to back off and turn away.
1:14:22|1:14:37|[Bei Zhai] moved his wrist, it seemed that the previous capture was merciless. [Shen Lian] stood up and walked towards the second floor of the inn. It was destined to be a sleepless night. [Pei Lun] also arrived on the second floor at some point.
1:14:54|1:15:27|But on these stairs, [Bei Zhai] was quietly sitting, eavesdropping on the conversation between the two. [Pei] replaced [Shen Lian] to express his thoughts. Suddenly, there was a commotion downstairs. [Shen Lian] hurried down the stairs, only to realize that something was wrong. [Bei Zhai] ran away. It was another stormy night, and [Bei Zhai] slipped away right under his nose again. In the alley, [Bei Zhai] heard the neighing of horses and dared not move forward.
1:15:27|1:15:54|It's no surprise that [Lu Wenzhao] sent people to search for the three of them. [Bei Zhai] turned back in fear, and in the flash of lightning, for a moment, he saw the reassuring face of [Shen Lian]. Just as [Bei Zhai] was about to flee, the sound of hooves rang out again. She pressed tightly against the wall, with a hint of panic in her eyes. Seizing the moment when the carriage had just left, [Bei Zhai] dashed into the rain and crossed the road. But just as [Shen Lian] reached the entrance of the alley, she heard...
1:15:58|1:16:7|The soldiers stationed in front, [Shen Lian] and [Bei Zhai] could only stand on opposite sides of the road, drenched by the pouring rain.
1:16:7|1:16:27|[Bei Zhai] knew that [Shen Lian] wouldn't be able to catch up this time. The wide road now seemed like an insurmountable barrier. [Shen Lian] just furrowed his brow, his eyes fierce as he glanced over there. The soldiers were warming themselves by the fire, sheltering from the rain under the eaves. He gazed at [Bei Zhai] with a complex expression, unable to express his feelings towards [Bei Zhai].
1:16:27|1:16:41|Forcing him into a dilemma, but what can he do even if he catches up with the person? The book rolled out from his arms was thrown out with force, landing at the feet of [Bei Zhai]. She picked it up with confusion, wiped off the rainwater on it, and took a closer look.
1:16:41|1:16:57|It was the construction plan of the treasure ship supervision, but when she looked up again, the figure was already gone. Looking at the empty alley, her heart suddenly felt empty, and thunder began to rumble. [Bei Zhai] wiped the rain off her face, turned around, and ran towards the depths of the alley.
1:16:57|1:17:6|The next morning, the dust had not yet settled in the East Bureau, but a major incident occurred inside. [Wei Zhongxian] was seated high under the plaque.
1:17:23|1:17:34|Kneeling on the ground, [Lu Wenzhao] slowly raised his head to look at [Wei Zhongxian]. Seeing that [Wei Zhongxian] remained silent, he lowered his head and started to calculate in his mind, pretending to be deeply disgusted.
1:18:15|1:18:18|[Bei Zhai] squeezed into the crowd on the street, looking at the posted notices.
1:18:34|1:18:46|[Shen Lian] turned around and saw [Pei Lun], who was still heavily injured, looking even paler. Suddenly, they heard something and quickly hid behind a pillar to look out. The door was pushed open.
1:18:46|1:19:4|[Shen Lian] held a knife in hand, ready to strike at any moment, but the unexpected visitor turned out to be [Bei Zhai]. [Pei Lun] let out a sigh of relief as the bargaining power finally returned to their hands. The factory official [Wei Zhongxian] toyed with the beads in his hand, looking thoughtfully at the kneeling [Lu Wenzhao] in front of him.
1:19:22|1:19:40|[Lu Wenzhao] is no match for [Wei Zhongxian]? [Lu Wenzhao] incredulously stared, [Wei Zhongxian] slowly stood up, then quickly lowered his head.
1:20:29|1:20:43|This is everyone's wish, but it only stops at being a wish. Not many dare to do it, and not everyone can succeed. Only a few people can move the great mountain of the eunuch party.
1:21:22|1:21:48|That day, in the Qingfeng Teahouse, [Ding Baiying] arrived with a knife, his men in the hall were in disarray, clearly the work of [Shen Lian]. He held up his hands with the knife and scabbard to show sincerity, eventually persuading [Ding Baiying]. In the evening, [Shen Lian] was blindfolded and taken to the mansion, where [Ding Baiying] uncovered his eyes and loosened his bindings, handing him a knife.
1:21:52|1:22:0|Kneeling next to [Shen Lian] after receiving the knife, [Bei Zhai] remained vigilant without any relaxation, still holding the knife and guarding against [Shen Lian].
1:22:36|1:22:45|On the other side, Pei Lun brought Bei Zhai to the entrance of the East Factory. The two hid in a nearby alley, and as Bei Zhai peeked out, Pei Lun immediately pulled him back.
1:22:52|1:22:58|King Xin picked up the construction record of the treasure ship on the table and threw it into the brazier.
1:23:28|1:24:1|In the end, he took the knife and left. In the room, only [Shen Lian] and the King of Xin were left. One sitting and one standing, with a brazier in between, the two men from the East Factory were still waiting. [Bei Zhai] seemed to have come from nowhere with confidence, which caught [Pei Lun] off guard. [Bei Zhai] disdainfully glanced at him, while [Pei Lun] boldly broke the ice.
1:24:24|1:24:41|King Xin squatted slowly beside [Shen Lian], staring at him intently, as if trying to see some secrets from his eyes. It was obvious that those who wanted to inherit the throne did not have it easy.
1:24:52|1:24:58|King Xin has got the answer he wanted. He stood up and said,
1:25:1|1:25:24|King Xin drew out his precious sword as Shen Lian recalled the day they first met, the reason was legitimate enough, and rare was King Xin's willingness to believe.
1:25:34|1:25:53|[Shen Lian] reached out and received it, but did not want to let go. [Shen Lian] stared at Xingwang with his eyes. This time he let go himself. Xingwang turned back helplessly. Emperors in the world have always been ruthless.
1:26:2|1:26:44|The King of Xin pointed his sword directly at [Shen Lian]'s eyes. [Shen Lian], who crawled out of a pile of dead bodies, was not afraid of this situation. He stood up, walked to the front of the sword, looked at the tip of the sword and then at the King of Xin. The King's eyes were cold, but [Shen Lian] was not to be trifled with. He reached out and grabbed the back of the sword, snatching it from the King of Xin's grasp. As the King tried to pick up the scabbard, [Shen Lian] took the token and seemed to receive a secret signal.
1:26:47|1:27:12|[Shen Lian] didn't dare to be careless, immediately crashed through the window and escaped. Prince Xin closed his eyes in pain. Outside the East Factory, [Pei Lun] stood up, reminding [Bei Zhai], who could only feel anxious. Meanwhile, at Prince Xin's residence, siblings [Lu Wenzhao] and [Ding Baiying] hurried over.
1:27:22|1:27:59|Right and wrong, the well-being of the world, what can compare to a loved one? The King of Xin reluctantly closes his eyes, [Lu Wenzhao] stands up and bows before leaving. The King of Xin lowers his head, emotions and reason conflicting in his heart. [Ding Baiying] also feels embarrassed, having previously vouched for his senior brother [Lu Wenzhao], silently following his footsteps and leaving the mansion. Only the lonely King of Xin remains, as the books in the brazier burn brightly.
1:28:0|1:28:27|Fleeing Shen Lian hurriedly ran to the East Factory, afraid of making a big mistake if he was a step too slow. When he arrived at the agreed place, he saw no one. Drawing his sword, he approached and leaned against the wall to observe the situation at the East Factory. He saw a row of guards standing at the door, holding torches and guarding the gate. He thought of fighting desperately, and the voice must be Bei Zhai. Shen Lian slowly turned around, only to see Pei Lun and Bei Zhai.
1:28:27|1:28:44|[Bei Zhai] breathed a sigh of relief, the joy in her eyes impossible to conceal. [Shen Lian] smiled thankfully, knowing that time waits for no one. The next day, they boarded a small boat that looked more like a skiff. [Shen Lian] spent his life as a boatman in armor, while [Bei Zhai] maintained the appearance of a refined lady.
1:28:44|1:28:52|[Shen Lian] rocked the boat, vigilantly surveying the surroundings,
1:29:14|1:29:30|[Shen Lian] stopped and looked at [Bei Zhai]. [Bei Zhai] knew that this man was carefully protecting his own heart. [Pei Lun] absentmindedly touched his Book of Changes, the soft leather cover had been with him for a long time.
1:29:32|1:29:53|He disdainfully shouted and threw him into the lake, completely abandoning his identity as a Jin Yi Wei. In the Golden Fish Alley, a guest arrived at the mansion of [Wei Zhongxian], dressed in luxurious attire, highlighting his transcendent temperament. Unlike the aging [Wei Zhongxian] with his disheveled white hair, this man is none other than the Prince of Xin.
1:30:47|1:30:59|[Wei Zhongxian] talked with the prince about the conditions. The prince knelt down in front of [Wei Zhongxian], begging for mercy. [Wei Zhongxian] walked towards him slowly.
1:31:8|1:31:25|The grief-stricken King of Xin, tears welled up in an instant. He twitched his mouth but couldn't utter a word, just sobbing and bowing his head, his body involuntarily trembling.
1:31:25|1:31:37|The cunning Wei Zhongxian naturally wouldn't easily trust anyone. He stepped forward and grabbed Shen Lian's arm, causing Shen Lian to lift his tear-streaked face.
1:31:42|1:31:50|Upon hearing this, [Wei Zhongxian] used both hands to help [Prince Xin] up and he stood up.
1:32:11|1:32:19|[Wei Zhongxian] stared at him intently, slowly retreated with his gaze, and then sat down in front of the chair.
1:32:24|1:32:39|[King Xin] immediately bowed with folded hands, burying his head low, unable to contain his anger any longer.
1:32:43|1:32:49|[Shen Lian] glanced at the sleeping [Bei Zhai], the two of them were looking at the map to choose a route.
1:33:15|1:33:25|The spirited horses galloped along the path as three individuals embarked on their escape journey. Passing through the wilderness, they encountered human skulls by the roadside, accompanied, of course, by a flock of crows.
1:33:27|1:33:39|Three people slowed down and arrived at a small town, but the town was deserted, with a few houses with open doors already filled with white bones. Overwhelmed by exhaustion, [Bei Zhai] collapsed.
1:33:39|1:33:59|[Shen Lian] dismounted in a hurry to check. The night had fallen without anyone noticing, and there was not a single light visible in the town. The three of them were repairing in a farmhouse, the fire in the stove supporting the temperature inside the house. When [Bei Zhai] woke up, [Shen Lian] hurried over to her and wiped the sweat off her face.
1:34:18|1:34:25|[Shen Lian] frowned seriously, [Bei Zhai] slowly raised her eyes, the firelight reflected on her pale face, and she weakly said
1:34:41|1:34:55|She propped up her weary almond eyes with force, while [Shen Lian] looked at him with great concern. The two by the fire, one leaning against the cabinet, the other supporting himself, faced each other like this. Suddenly, [Shen Lian] heard a commotion outside the door.
1:34:58|1:35:18|He carried a knife and went out to check the situation. The moonlight was bright, the courtyard was unpredictable. [Shen Lian] alertly walked towards the door. Suddenly, a person leaped down from the roof beam and attacked [Shen Lian] aggressively. It was [Ding Chong]. As she swung her knife, a iron rod suddenly flew in and smashed onto [Ding Chong]'s head.
1:35:30|1:35:56|[Ding Chong], knowing he was no match, ignited a bomb, intending to die with the two. Fortunately, the two reacted in time, minimizing the impact. However, the bomb revealed their location to the pursuers. [Shen Lian] mounted his horse, carrying [Bei Zhai] and [Pei Lun] in different directions. In the forest path, a figure lay in wait on horseback, seizing the opportunity in the darkness to attack. The masked figure raised a musket.
1:35:56|1:36:8|The figure falling off the horse in the scene turned out to be [Shen Lian], using [Ding Chong]'s body to scout ahead. The masked man was caught off guard, and before he could react, [Shen Lian]'s crossbow arrow had been released, taking the masked man's life with the wind-carried arrow.
1:36:8|1:36:33|[Shen Lian] embraced [Bei Zhai], loaded the crossbow bolts, and several masked men once again attacked. Taking advantage of the fire's light, [Shen Lian] locked onto one of them and shot him dead. As the pursuers on horseback approached with loud shouts, [Shen Lian] drew the embroidered spring knife and struck horizontally. [Shen Lian] bent down to let [Bei Zhai] dodge, then turned around and kicked the horse's leg. The pursuer fell off the horse and tumbled into the jungle.
1:36:33|1:36:45|Without waiting for [Shen Lian] to catch his breath, the pursuers with spears quickly arrived. As the saying goes, inch by inch is strong, they immediately engaged in battle. With [Bei Zhai] to consider, [Shen Lian] found it difficult to gain the upper hand and had to spur the horse to try to increase the distance.
1:36:45|1:36:58|The spear pointed directly at the back of [Shen Lian], but at a critical moment, [Pei Lun] suddenly appeared from the side and knocked them down along with the horse. It turned out that [Shen Lian] had already planned for this, seeing that the rendezvous point was within reach, choosing to avoid fighting.
1:36:58|1:37:22|Although [Pei Lun] arrived in time to break the siege, the pursuers were not far behind. The group dared not relax and continued to move forward under the moonlight. As dawn broke, [Shen Lian] grabbed the reins, and the three of them anxiously looked ahead. In front of them was a canyon, with only a narrow vine bridge connecting the two sides. [Pei Lun] urged the horses onto the bridge.
1:37:22|1:37:34|The horse's feet seemed to be nailed to the ground, refusing to take a single step forward, while [Pei Lun] tugged at the reins with all his might, but the horse remained indifferent.
1:37:34|1:37:58|Pei Lun looked at the hundred-meter suspension bridge hanging from the vine, feeling like he had reached a dead end. He had to turn back and discuss countermeasures with [Shen Lian]. The three of them were already in a dilemma. In the nearby woods, the sound of horses neighing could be heard, the pursuers were approaching. They masked their faces, carried knives, and rode swiftly on their steeds.
1:38:26|1:38:39|The two arrived at the bridge. He gave [Bei Zhai] a gentle push. [Shen Lian] urged in a stern tone, [Bei Zhai] turned and walked onto the drawbridge, taking big strides as if in a huff. But before reaching halfway, he stopped again.
1:38:39|1:39:3|She turned back and shouted, [Shen Lian], who had just turned around, was taken aback. After hesitating for a moment, he turned back. [Bei Zhai] said seriously, [Shen Lian]'s expression was somewhat complicated. This girl, for whom he had poured his heart out, he now only knew her name. He gritted his teeth and uttered these words, not knowing when they would meet again.
1:39:5|1:39:12|Watching her back, [Shen Lian]'s eyes were a little moist. Pei Lun threw the precious sword to her, and the two turned around to face the enemy.
1:39:16|1:39:32|The newcomer came aggressively, Pei Lun secretly pulled up the trip rope, [Shen Lian] ran up to jump, and cut off the pursuer's arm with a knife. The masked man attacked again, Pei Lun dodged in time, and the opponent unexpectedly rushed down the gorge.
1:39:32|1:39:55|[Shen Lian] walked forward with a knife, made a move to the waist, and took down the enemy who stumbled due to the horse trap. [Lu Wenzhao] and his sister rushed in with their troops. On the other side, in the grand palace with clear skies, the Prince of Xin, dressed in luxurious attire, looked despondent. Pei Lun idly twirled a stick in front of the drawbridge.
1:39:57|1:40:30|[Lu Wenzhao] dismounted, drew the long knife hanging on the horse's belly, and the siblings advanced slowly together, with the surrounding soldiers following closely in a encircling formation. Pei Lun took a puff of his pipe and tucked it into his waist. The woman had already crossed the bridge. [Lu Wenzhao] whispered, [Shen Lian] looked confidently at Pei Lun. The masked man raised his knife and charged. [Shen Lian] slashed left and kicked right, swift as a tiger descending a mountain, fierce as a wolf among sheep.
1:40:30|1:40:47|Pei Lun wielded his iron staff skillfully, creating a powerful force. When faced with the combined attack of the masked men, Pei Lun swung his hands again and overturned them. The masked men grabbed the iron staff, but unexpectedly, one of them pulled out a short knife and swiftly dealt with him with a series of stabs.
1:40:50|1:41:6|[Pei Lun] fought more bravely as [Shen Lian] held the enemy at bay. The elegant Spring Blade rested against the masked man's neck, blood splattered, and the man fell down like mud. [Shen Lian] looked at [Ding Baiying] and [Lu Wenzhao], and the two finally took their stances, ready to fight.
1:41:6|1:41:12|[Shen Lian] knew that this brother and sister duo were the real enemies, and the three of them were ready to strike at any moment.
1:41:14|1:41:28|At this moment, [Bei Zhai] in the mountains was running frantically with a bundle on her back. After a while, her pace gradually slowed down. She gasped and turned around. On the other side of the forest, swords clashed. [Bei Zhai] hesitated.
1:41:30|1:41:37|[Shen Lian] was being pressed back by two opponents while holding the ancestral Embroidered Spring Knife. He created some distance and shot out a crossbow bolt.
1:41:39|1:42:1|[Lu Wenzhao] dodged, [Ding Baiying] attacked, [Shen Lian] used a crossbow and a knife to force him back, [Lu Wenzhao] took the opportunity to sneak attack with a knife, hitting [Shen Lian] in the back, [Ding Baiying] attacked again, scratching [Shen Lian]'s abdomen, the two fought together, [Shen Lian] narrowly avoided danger several times with his agility, [Ding Baiying] struck with a knife, the two struggled, [Lu Wenzhao] swung a long knife horizontally towards them, [Shen Lian] hurriedly defended.
1:42:1|1:42:24|[Lu Wenzhao] struck down with his long sword, fiercely hitting [Shen Lian]'s embroidered spring knife. Seizing the opportunity, [Ding Baiying] attacked from the side, but [Shen Lian] leaped into the air, avoiding the fatal blow. As he landed and stood up, [Pei Lun] saw him in a desperate situation and threw his short knife. [Shen Lian] caught it in mid-air, one hand gripping it normally and the other in reverse, adopting both offensive and defensive postures.
1:42:24|1:42:50|In the forest, [Bei Zhai] turned around and ran back towards the drawbridge. On the drawbridge, black-clothed men were suppressing [Pei Lun], but he used their force to strike back, sending them off the cliff. [Pei Lun] on the drawbridge used his stick with great force to sweep the enemies off. [Shen Lian] took the opportunity to duel with [Ding Baiying]. [Ding Baiying] used his Japanese sword skills, but his strike hit the back of Shen Lian's embroidered spring knife. Shen Lian took advantage of this to switch the knife from his right hand to his left hand.
1:42:50|1:43:7|[Shen Lian] deciphered the Japanese swordsmanship. Every time he was struck by the back of the blade, [Shen Lian] took the opportunity to counterattack. With gritted teeth, [Ding Baiying] gripped the knife with both hands and struck vertically. [Pei Lun] struggled to climb back up the drawbridge. [Shen Lian] placed his left hand on his right wrist for leverage, completely suppressing [Ding Baiying].
1:43:7|1:43:15|[Lu Wenzhao] hurried over, [Pei Lun] quickly followed, [Shen Lian] threw the pipe knife, [Lu Wenzhao] dodged by turning his head, but firmly grabbed [Pei Lun] from behind.
1:43:15|1:43:40|[Lu Wenzhao] exerted all his strength to strike, but the blade stopped in front of [Shen Lian]'s forehead. It turned out that [Pei Lun], who caught the blade first, had already killed [Lu Wenzhao] by stabbing him through. With wide eyes full of disbelief, [Lu Wenzhao] fell. [Pei Lun] then pulled out the blade.
1:43:51|1:43:57|[Ding Baiying] covers her senior brother's wound to stop the bleeding.
1:44:32|1:44:47|Sounds echoed in the valley, [Shen Lian] hurried to the edge of the cliff, only to see many soldiers and horses coming and going in the previous town, with the sound of neighing echoing in the canyon, the scene of birds hiding and bows ready to be staged.
1:44:54|1:45:30|[Shen Lian] and [Ding Baiying] supported the heavily injured [Lu Wenzhao]. There was really no cover on the ground, the small stones couldn't hide the three of them. [Shen Lian] quickly moved to [Pei Lun]'s side. In the magnificent imperial city, the Prince still stood at the gate. The old eunuch [Wei Zhongxian] eagerly approached, while the Prince turned around with a worried look. The Prince was on the verge of tears, but [Wei Zhongxian] was all smiles.
1:45:31|1:45:38|The ambush battle at the cliff edge is still ongoing, the siblings hiding behind the rocks are trembling with fear,
1:45:50|1:46:26|[Lu Wenzhao] suddenly realized, his eyes widened in shock and he felt a sense of panic. He couldn't believe that a loyal minister would end up in such a situation. [Lu Wenzhao] shouted hoarsely, his face twisted in pain, and [Ding Baiying] lowered his eyes, unable to look. [Lu Wenzhao] gently touched his junior sister's eyes, then stood up abruptly. With a proud and defiant posture, he walked towards the soldiers, amidst the astonished gazes of the crowd.
1:46:26|1:46:36|A cannonball hit his chest, almost knocking him down. Beside him, [Ding Baiying] nervously said, "The enemy forces are surging forward, pushing and shoving each other."
1:46:36|1:47:5|The staggering [Lu Wenzhao] was disregarded by everyone. This time, he was engulfed in the torrential flow and turbulent era like fate. With each strike, [Lu Wenzhao] fell, and [Ding Baiying] surged with blood, gripping his long sword to stand up and face the enemy, using his life to write the final elegy. [Master Ding] no longer had swordsmanship, only heroism.
1:47:5|1:47:31|[Shen Lian] turned around, and the figure reappeared. The soldiers drew their swords and charged forward. [Shen Lian] was anxious, unwilling to let his beloved take such a risk. He hurried forward.
1:47:41|1:47:58|[Bei Zhai] stopped in his tracks, looking anxiously at [Shen Lian], who held a knife in one hand blocking the drawbridge. The screams of [Master Ding], the fierce battle of [Pei Lun], and the body of [Lu Wenzhao] all foretold this tragic ending.
1:47:58|1:48:32|[Shen Lian] swung his knife at the vine, causing the suspension bridge to sway. Gritting his teeth, he fiercely chopped with both hands gripping the knife. On the bridge, [Bei Zhai]'s figure swayed, pleading in agony. As the bridge was about to break, [Bei Zhai] tearfully ran back, but after a few steps, turned back to look at [Shen Lian]. [Shen Lian] kicked and slashed with his knife, cutting through the branches and leaves, severing his own emotions and concerns one slash after another.
1:48:32|1:48:57|[Bei Zhai] stood at the bridgehead, momentarily speechless. [Shen Lian] left no room for retreat, swinging his sword once again. The bridge broke, cutting off not only the bridge but also [Bei Zhai]'s deep concerns. On the cliff, behind [Shen Lian] was chaos and disorder, while behind [Bei Zhai] perhaps lay the dawn of a new era.
1:48:57|1:49:18|[Shen Lian] gave one last glance at [Bei Zhai], lifted his sword, and with an unmatched fierceness, charged into the battlefield. Knowing this man's nature, [Bei Zhai] shouldered her burden and headed towards the mountains. The fierce battle was now in full swing, even if one were to die here, there would be no regrets.
1:49:18|1:49:28|The bedridden emperor stretched out his hand to beckon his brother, and smiled contentedly.
1:49:40|1:49:52|On the cliff, the oil lamp flickering, [Shen Lian] lies on the ground, wielding the Embroidered Spring Knife, while [Master Ding], covered in blood, his long knife with jagged edges, lies beside him.
1:50:9|1:50:29|[Shen Lian] suddenly widened his eyes, as if a last burst of energy, his whole spirit revived, wielding his sword with a majestic aura, like a war god in the mortal world. An archer shot an arrow at his thigh, but [Shen Lian] just slightly swayed his body, then reached back to pull out the arrow deeply embedded in his thigh, fiercely intimidating the soldiers who were closing in on him.
1:50:29|1:51:2|The brave soldier, Shen Lian, who doesn't believe in superstitions, seizes the opportunity to strike, but ends up trading injury for life. Despite being at the end of his strength, he unexpectedly displays such formidable fighting power that it terrifies the besieging soldiers. Sitting on the ground, gasping for breath with his sword in hand, he hears a voice in his mind, as if it's a call from the brink of death. Kneeling on the ground, he furrows his brow and stares with determination.
1:51:2|1:51:23|The soldier struck with all his might on his back. Pei Lun, leaning against a huge rock at some point, fell asleep peacefully with a pipe in his mouth. Exhausted, Master Ding stared blankly at the uneven blades in his hand, Shen Lian fell, and half a month later in Beijing City,
1:52:0|1:52:11|[Wei Zhongxian] handed over a roster, which Emperor Chongzhen [Zhu Youjian] took and glanced through. He then calmly looked at [Wei Zhongxian] beside him and spoke,
1:52:30|1:52:51|Young [Zhu Youjian], full of spirit, raised his head and changed his attitude. [Wei Zhongxian] looked around at the soldiers and officers, realizing that none of them were from his faction. He suddenly woke up to the fact that he had lost power. Understanding the situation, he quickly bowed and took his leave. In this battle, the Wei faction was completely eliminated, and there were no eunuch factions in the court anymore.
1:52:51|1:52:57|Three months later, the Emperor stripped [Wei Zhongxian] of all his duties and exiled him to guard the tomb in Fengyang.
1:52:57|1:53:26|[Wei Zhongxian] died on the way, and the next year the emperor chose the reign title, Chongzhen. After [Wei Zhongxian] left, the emperor finally started to mark names in red. This time, he saw [Shen Lian]'s name prominently on the list. The emperor held the brush in the air, hesitating to put it down. In the prison, [Shen Lian] looked disheveled, with unkempt hair and beard. The Imperial Guards arrived with attendants, bringing food and wine, the flickering firelight illuminating their final dinner.
