0:0:25|0:0:42|A winding path on the Loess Plateau. The young [You Tianming] follows behind his father [You Bensheng], heading to the home of the blacksmith [Jiao Sanye] to apprentice. [You Tianming] pouts, looking reluctant.
0:0:42|0:1:5|The father picked up a small stone and threw it towards [You Tianming], who dodged it. They continued walking as villagers herded sheep past them. Standing on a high ground, the father stopped to catch his breath, the scorching sun making him sweat profusely. Looking down at the village by the Yellow River, the father said,
0:1:10|0:1:17|The father placed the package he carried on the ground, took off his sun hat, wiped the sweat with his sleeve, and began to fan himself with the hat. The father and son arrived at the home of [Jiao Sanye], and the father cautiously opened a crack in the door to look inside.
0:1:39|0:1:50|Then he opened the door and led [You Tianming] inside. The dog raised by [Jiao Sanye], Niu Niu, heard the commotion and ran out, startling the father and son, who quickly hid behind the wall.
0:1:52|0:2:9|[Jiao Sanye] took Nuonuo back into the house, while the father led [You Tianming] into the courtyard. The father stood in the courtyard, staring straight at the house. After a while, [Jiao Sanye] slowly walked out and sat on the wooden chair in front of the house.
0:2:14|0:2:21|The father took out a cigarette from his pocket and ran towards [Jiao Sanye], but he didn't notice the steps on the ground and fell hard.
0:2:36|0:2:58|Father's head was injured, and [You Tianming] tenderly covered the wound, a tear rolling down his cheek. Observing this scene, [Jiao Sanye] seemed pensive as Father got up and picked up his wet pipe from the puddle. Pointing at the pipe in his hand, [Jiao Sanye] and Father shared an awkward glance with [You Tianming].
0:3:0|0:3:9|The cicadas chirped, the sun was high in the sky, the father and son, along with [Jiao Sanye], all unconsciously looked up at the sun.
0:3:15|0:3:22|Youbensheng lit a pipe for [Jiao Sanye], who took two deep puffs.
0:3:28|0:3:42|At this moment, [Shiniang] walked out of the house carrying two bowls of water. The father and son took the water and drank it in big gulps, finishing it in one go.
0:4:19|0:4:29|Shiniang placed a water ladle on the small wooden table in the courtyard and handed a small section of reed to You Tianming. You Tianming's initiation test has begun.
0:4:33|0:4:46|You Tianming reluctantly turned his head to look at his father, who nodded for him to do as told. Reluctantly, You Tianming walked to the water gourd and started to suck water with all his might.
0:4:56|0:5:8|Young You Tianming couldn't drink up the water in the ladle, and the water in his mouth sprayed out and spilled onto the ground. Shiniang looked at little Tianming with concern, while his father walked over to Jiao Sanye and pleaded.
0:5:24|0:5:30|[Jiao Sanye] still refused to accept You Tianming as his disciple. His father turned around and looked at Tianming lying on the ground, and began to scold him.
0:5:47|0:6:11|Seeing [Jiao Sanye] still unmoved, the father continued to beat him with a water stick. Suddenly, [Jiao Sanye] grabbed his father's arm suspended in the air, indicating his acceptance of [You Tianming]. The father walked out of [Jiao Sanye]'s house, with [You Tianming] still following behind.
0:6:36|0:6:49|It suddenly turned into a deep attachment. In Jiao Sanye's home, Shiniang carried lunch from the kitchen to the hall and placed it on the table. You Tianming only sat down after Shiniang had sat down.
0:6:52|0:7:4|The three of them picked up their chopsticks and started eating. [You Tianming] lowered his head and began to slurp the porridge in his bowl, the sound making the first lunch for the three of them a bit awkward.
0:7:37|0:7:41|[Shiniang] twists together strands of colorful threads.
0:8:0|0:8:5|When talking about her own child, [Shiniang] couldn't help but reveal a sad expression.
0:8:52|0:9:5|By the side of the Yellow River, in the reed bushes, several birds fly freely, chirping crisply and agilely. [You Tianming] runs through the reeds and sees his master [Jiao Sanye] standing by the river, carrying a shoulder pole and holding a sickle.
0:9:12|0:9:25|You Tianming ran towards [Jiao Sanye]. [Jiao Sanye] used a sickle to cut off a reed, trimming off the end with leaves. The reed was over a meter long and hollow inside.
0:9:37|0:9:49|You Tianming took the reed stem from [Shiniang]'s hand, and [Shiniang] bent down to pick up her own belongings and left. Following [Shiniang]'s example, You Tianming bent down to prepare to suck up water.
0:9:52|0:10:4|[Shiniang] gave another reminder before walking away. You Tianming began to suck in water with all his might. It was high noon, the sun blazing overhead. After a short while of sucking, You Tianming was drenched in sweat.
0:10:6|0:10:30|He gasped for a few breaths, continued to suck in water, and exerted all his strength. But for You Tianming, the reed was just too long, and he was pushed down to the ground by the resistance all at once. The camera pulled back, the bright red sunset reflected in the river, and You Tianming was still practicing hard to suck in water.
0:10:32|0:10:44|The sky darkened, You Tianming slung his head and carried a reed back to his master's house. The master was preparing dinner, pouring himself a drink from a small jug.
0:10:49|0:11:0|[Jiao Sanye] angrily slammed the wine pot on the table, while [Shiniang] walked out of the kitchen with a bowl full of rice. The master grabbed it and scooped out most of it into his own bowl, leaving only a small portion for [You Tianming].
0:11:8|0:11:18|Shiniang looked worriedly at You Tianming, while Jiao Sanye poured himself a small cup of white wine and drank it all in one gulp. Shiniang dared not speak again.
0:11:31|0:11:52|Depressed [You Tianming] lay barefoot on the bed, [Shiniang] walked in with a bowl of sweet potatoes, scratched [Tianming]'s feet, and he turned around and sat up. [Shiniang], [You Tianming] pouted and moved towards the bed edge, [Shiniang] placed the bowl on the bed edge, and wiped away the tears from [Tianming]'s face.
0:11:57|0:12:6|[Shiniang] smiled and pushed the bowl of sweet potatoes towards [You Tianming]. Seeing that [You Tianming] didn't react, she said,
0:12:8|0:12:15|[You Tianming] picked up a sweet potato and ate it with both hands. [Shiniang] let out a sigh of relief with a smile.
0:12:16|0:12:31|The next day, still in the reed marsh, rustling sounds were heard as the gentle breeze blew. [You Tianming] was drawing water by the river, and big drops of sweat rolled down his face. Several villagers carrying reeds passed by.
0:12:58|0:13:5|You Tianming heard the villagers' conversation, paused thoughtfully for a moment, and then began to suck up the water more vigorously.
0:13:6|0:13:27|At this moment, [You Tianming]'s face was covered in sweat as if sprayed with water. Finally, [You Tianming] took a sip of water. He seemed somewhat incredulous, spat out the water in his mouth, cupped it in his hands, and then excitedly ran towards his master's house.
0:13:28|0:13:33|The fish in the river leaped out of the water, and the birds in the Bai Xiang room soared in the air, as if all were cheering for him.
0:13:37|0:14:1|[You Tianming] rushed into the house, and the master was splitting the dried reeds. The master nodded but didn't stop his work. He split another reed and then searched through the pile of reeds nearby to find a suitable one.
0:14:3|0:14:24|Trimmed both ends with scissors and handed it to [You Tianming]. This reed stalk was thicker and longer than the previous one, far exceeding [You Tianming]'s height. [Jiao Sanye] spoke as he worked.
0:14:27|0:14:47|[You Tianming] looked at the reed taller than himself, the sky was covered with dark clouds, thunder rumbling, and suddenly pouring rain. [You Tianming] looked up at the sky, knelt by the river, ignoring the heavy rain, and continued to practice water absorption. [Shiniang] and [Shiniang] came to find [You Tianming].
0:14:53|0:15:7|[Shiniang] holding an umbrella, [Master] wearing a robe, the two of them with intertwined expressions, walking together, weaving through the reeds. They spot [You Tianming] by the river, [Shiniang] hurries over to him, holding the umbrella for him.
0:15:7|0:15:12|[Shifu] threw away the reed in [You Tianming]'s hand, dressed him in a robe, and put his own straw hat on him.
0:15:17|0:15:38|The next morning, the sky, washed by heavy rain, revealed a faint light, making it even more vast. [You Tianming] lay on the bed naked, slowly opened his eyes, and was attracted by a feather fluttering outside the window. He got up and knelt by the window, only to see the master planning to take on a new disciple, while the young disciple [Lan Yu] was blowing the feather.
0:15:39|0:15:58|He walked into the courtyard in his new clothes, with Lan Yu's father standing by. You Tianming looked in amazement as the feather was blown back and forth by Brother Er, never touching the ground. Brother Er's short stature even blew the feather over the eaves. Jiao Sanye was preparing feed by the cowshed, while Shiniang was in Chanzhou.
0:15:58|0:16:1|[Jiao Sanye] walked out holding a small piece of wood.
0:16:37|0:16:58|[Lan Lan] took a few steps back, about a meter away from the wooden board. She turned to look at [Jiao Sanye], who signaled that she could start spraying. [Lan Lan] sprayed with all her might, and the wooden board fell down. [Jiao Sanye] glanced at You Tianming, who lowered his head. [Lan Lan]'s father had a big smile on his face, very satisfied. However, [Jiao Sanye] remained silent in his chair.
0:16:59|0:17:19|Lan Yu's father gestured for Lan Yu to step forward. Lan Yu, still holding a water ladle, walked up to Jiao Sanye and knelt down to pay respects. However, Jiao Sanye walked into the house with a pipe in hand, while Lan Yu's father approached.
0:17:22|0:17:38|[Lan Yu] knelt on the ground, his big eyes full of vitality. He turned to look at [You Tianming], who smiled happily. [Jiao Sanye] took a puff of his cigarette, turned around and said.
0:17:39|0:17:49|[Lan Yu] looked at his father with shining eyes. At night, [You Tianming] sat on the edge of the bed playing with his hands, while [Lan Yu] made the bed.
0:18:10|0:18:33|[You Tianming] picked up the reed placed by the bed. In the early morning, a thin mist enveloped the river bay, and the two brothers [Brother Er] came to the river to practice water absorption. Barefoot [Lan Yu], the two bent their bodies, and the long reed plunged deep into the river.
0:18:33|0:18:40|It's another early morning. Before the two of them even wake up, [You Tianming] suddenly sits up and slaps the sleeping [Lan Yu].
0:18:47|0:19:13|[Lan Yu] lay down and raised his head, still half asleep. Then, the two of them ran with sickles to the master's fields. The master and [Shiniang] were harvesting wheat. [Lan Yu] ran into the wheat field first, with [You Tianming] following behind. The master and [Shiniang] noticed the two of them and stood up to investigate the situation.
0:19:14|0:19:34|Brother Er and his two brothers only showed their heads in the dense forest that was almost as tall as them, while the master and Shiniang continued to bend over and work. Although Lan Yu was small in stature, she worked efficiently and skillfully, in stark contrast to You Tianming, whose movements were much slower.
0:19:34|0:19:38|It's just that [Lan Yu] casually threw the cut wheat on the ground, in a disorderly manner.
0:19:42|0:20:1|[You Tianming] shook his head when he saw it, feeling quite speechless. This would add a lot of work later on. In the master's small courtyard, [Jiao Sanye]'s troupe was rehearsing for their overseas performance. [Jiao Sanye] sat in the middle, with many villagers watching the excitement in the courtyard.
0:20:1|0:20:10|Shiniang leaned against the door frame, her face filled with pride and admiration for Jiao Sanye. You Tianming and Lan Yu stared wide-eyed and open-mouthed, completely absorbed in listening.
0:20:29|0:20:33|For over two months, Master led the [Jiao family troupe] through more than a dozen gates.
0:20:37|0:20:46|With [You Tianming] watching the Jiao family moving away in the distance in the field, he then continued to work hard.
0:21:11|0:21:21|[You Tianming] excitedly ran back to his house with a cloth bundle on his back.
0:21:31|0:21:40|Father is pushing the millstone to grind flour, then suddenly stops. The family sits around to have lunch, and mother asks.
0:22:12|0:22:22|The parents finally felt relieved and smiled with joy. The father added a piece of meat for [You Tianming]. The mother also happily added a pancake for [You Tianming].
0:22:23|0:22:40|At night, [You Tianming] and his sister lay on the cool mat in the courtyard, getting ready to sleep. Their mother was gently fanning with a palm-leaf fan beside them, and the sister had already fallen asleep. [You Tianming] was still wide awake, showing no signs of sleepiness. Their father sat on a lounge chair nearby.
0:22:44|0:22:51|The mother looked puzzled and turned to ask [Jiao Sanye]. [You Tianming] stood up smugly.
0:23:12|0:23:17|Facing his father's expectations, [You Tianming] seemed to have understood something, and said firmly.
0:23:59|0:24:4|The father leaned back in his reclining chair again, looking at the night sky while fanning himself with a palm leaf fan.
0:24:16|0:24:28|The next day, [You Tianming] was transferring corn from a storage room to a basket. [Lan Yu] covered his eyes from behind. [You Tianming] pushed away [Lan Yu]'s hand.
0:24:40|0:24:44|[You Tianming] led [Lan Yu] towards his father who was tidying up the sheep pen.
0:25:1|0:25:7|At this moment, the younger sister returned with the sheep. [You Tianming] introduced [Lan Yu].
0:25:11|0:25:32|Later, the three of them played on the swing in the village together. Little sister Xiuzhi sat on the swing and swung very high with the help of her two brothers. Then, Xiuzhi and [Lan Yu] sat on the swing together, with [You Tianming] pushing them from behind. Innocent and joyful smiles bloomed on the faces of the three, enjoying the most beautiful time of their childhood.
0:25:32|0:25:47|At night, three people catch fireflies together. The fireflies are flying all over the sky, emitting twinkling lights. The three children are excitedly jumping around, as if they are competing to catch fireflies.
0:25:47|0:26:8|They gathered together and slowly opened their tightly held hands. The green light emitted by the fireflies illuminated their faces. The three of them looked in amazement as the fireflies flew out of their hands, soaring into the air and blending into the tranquil and beautiful rural night scene.
0:26:8|0:26:17|Tianming and [Lan Yu] returned to [Shiniang]'s house. [Shiniang] took down a box from the top of the wardrobe in the bedroom. Despite being covered in thick dust, it was still exquisite.
0:26:19|0:26:31|[Shiniang] opened the box, inside were various types of lock picks. [Shiniang] took out a very delicate lock pick from a small cloth bag to show to her two disciples.
0:26:56|0:27:4|[Lan Yu] carefully took the precious sona from [Shiniang]'s hand. [Shiniang] then picked up another sona and said to [Lan Yu].
0:27:9|0:27:11|Shiniang hands the anger card to Lan Yu.
0:27:17|0:27:28|[Lan Yu], full of joy, took the harmonica and blew with all his might, but it didn't make a sound. Master took out the flat whistle.
0:27:30|0:27:34|The master inserted the whistle into the air vent and tested it, then held the sonar to watch Lan Yu.
0:27:48|0:28:5|[Lan Yu] nodded vigorously and took the sona with both hands. The master then took out a sona rod from the box and blew off the dust on it. [You Tianming] thought this sona was for him, just about to reach out to take it, but the master put it back in the box directly.
0:28:5|0:28:10|Master reached out to take back the Qing Dynasty sona from [You Tianming], who handed it over with both hands.
0:28:14|0:28:40|The master put it back into the velvet bag, placed it in the box, closed the lid, and put the box back in the bedroom. [You Tianming] was a little anxious and puzzled, staring straight ahead in the direction the master had left. In the evening, [Lan Yu] lay half-reclined on the bed, constantly fiddling with her lock.
0:28:44|0:28:50|[You Tianming] sat on the edge of the bed, crying and packing his luggage, occasionally wiping away tears with his arm.
0:28:54|0:29:1|Tianming remained silent, continuing to fold his clothes. Lan Yu, who was once his childhood friend, approached him and asked with concern.
0:29:17|0:29:32|The next day, just as dawn was breaking, You Tianming carried his bedding and luggage out of his master's house. Standing on the hill where his father had dropped him off, he glanced back in the direction of his master's house before continuing on his way.
0:29:37|0:29:43|Upon entering his own home, he happened to overhear his father's conversation, so he hid by the wall.
0:31:4|0:31:22|Whether you believe it or not, Tianming, after hearing his father's words, resolutely walked out of the house and returned to his master's home. The master was repairing farm tools in the yard at that time. Tianming hid behind the screen wall, peeked out his head, and quickly retracted it when the master noticed him.
0:31:24|0:31:28|Tianming walked out from behind the wall with excitement, and the dog Niu Niu went to greet him.
0:31:34|0:31:37|He placed his bedding and luggage on the lid of the water tank.
0:31:47|0:31:55|Tianming carried the meal from the kitchen to the hall and found a lock on the table, next to it was a checkered cloth bag.
0:31:59|0:32:5|Tianming sat down with skepticism, looking at the suona on the table, tears shimmering in his eyes.
0:32:12|0:32:16|[You Tianming] slowly picks up the suona on the table.
0:32:20|0:32:25|[You Tianming] carefully examined the suona, tears welling up in his eyes.
0:32:30|0:32:36|[Jiao Sanye] sat on the recliner outside the house, while [You Tianming] inside was already in tears.
0:32:42|0:32:50|[You Tianming] looked at [Shiniang] with gratitude in his eyes, while [Shiniang] sat in a lounge chair smoking, the scene before her gradually blurred by tears.
0:32:53|0:33:3|In the following days, Brother Er and Jiao Sanye learned to play the suona from Shiniang. In the courtyard, they stood in front of Shiniang, she played a tune, and they followed suit.
0:33:16|0:33:35|[Shiniang] is extremely serious, demonstrating every move and rhythm repeatedly. [Brother Er] and [Lan Yu] are also learning seriously. They moved from the courtyard to the Yellow River to practice absorbing water before coming here, with the wide water surface and the magnificent Qin Chuan of eight hundred miles as the background. They focus on every finger technique and practice with more vigor.
0:33:44|0:34:6|[Lan Yu], attracted by various bird calls, walked into the grass and trees by the river, searching for the birds' traces, only to discover [Jiao Sanye].
0:34:11|0:34:31|[Lan Yu] walked carefully to [Jiao Sanye], who stood with his hands on his hips, carefully listening to his daughter's call. He used a whistle and gestures to imitate a lively call. There seemed to be a response in the distance, but it was not clear. [Jiao Sanye] imitated another call.
0:34:36|0:34:57|In the distance, there came a response, [Shiniang] led Lan Yu forward with a smile. Passing through the dense grass, they saw [You Tianming] practicing bird calls deep in the bushes. [Shiniang] was pleasantly surprised and let out a cry. Tianming turned around, looking surprised.
0:34:59|0:35:10|[Lan Yu] ran to [You Tianming]'s side. [Shiniang] couldn't stop smiling as she approached [You Tianming].
0:35:13|0:35:21|[Lan Yu] reacted quickly, extending three fingers.
0:35:37|0:36:13|Jiao Sanye carefully distinguished for a while, saying that besides the three kinds of trees planted by [Lan Yu] in childhood, there are also yellow birds, cranes, kites, eagles, and another kind that you haven't heard of. [Shiniang] casually picked a small leaf from the tree next to her, put it near her mouth, and imitated it with gestures.
0:36:13|0:36:25|In the distance, the birds unexpectedly responded. [Shiniang] lovingly touched the noses of her two disciples.
0:36:28|0:36:32|In the evening, the Jiao family troupe rehearses in the courtyard of [Jiao Sanye]'s house.
0:36:39|0:36:53|[You Tianming] and [Lan Yu] sat on the millstone, facing each other, feeling a bit embarrassed. [Lan Yu] stood up first, took a whistle out of his ear, and tried it. [Jiao Sanye] walked out of the house, and [Lan Yu] started playing the tune.
0:36:56|0:37:21|[Lan Yu] swayed her body slightly with the rhythm, playing the flute skillfully. The senior brothers, including [Brother Er], looked at her approvingly, listening with great interest. The master sat at the dining table, fanning himself with his eyes closed, enjoying the music.
0:37:38|0:37:40|You Tianming stood up with a frown.
0:38:0|0:38:20|Continuing, [You Tianming] then individually dismantled the lock sodium bowl, and walked to the dining table to pick up a rice bowl to imitate. [Brother Er] stood up and spoke to the master.
0:38:23|0:38:46|Today we'll stop here, and tomorrow we have a long journey ahead. Everyone pack up and get ready to leave. Tomorrow, [You Tianming] will also go with us. [You Tianming] is pleasantly surprised. The next day, two boys of similar age to You Tianming enter [Jiao Sanye]'s house carrying a stele tower on their backs. Everyone puts their locks and other musical instruments into the stele tower.
0:38:46|0:38:49|The boy wants to put You Tianming's lock of hair into the stele tower.
0:39:6|0:39:14|At the bustling Bai Market, Master leads his apprentices in a chaotic performance, while You Tianming and [Lan Yu] watch from the side.
0:39:27|0:39:38|Suddenly, [Lan Lan] saw Xiuzhi in the crowd. She thought she was mistaken, rubbed her eyes, looked carefully, and saw Xiuzhi hiding behind the adults, looking at her with a mix of reluctance and hesitation.
0:40:25|0:40:33|You Tianming stood up and looked at his master, [Jiao Sanye] shook his head.
0:40:41|0:40:43|Jiao Sanye smiled and shook his head as usual.
0:40:57|0:40:59|He stood up and walked to the portrait of his father.
0:41:23|0:41:35|In the past, in Jingzhuang, there were five surnames: Zhang, Wang, Qian, Li, and Zha. They almost squeezed out people of other surnames.
0:41:38|0:41:50|You Tianming, who had been paying close attention to the situation, sat down and locked eyes with [Lan Yu]. In the evening, the members of Jiao Sanye's troupe sat around together for dinner.
0:42:2|0:42:25|Beside the grass pile, [Lan Yu] imitated adults by smoking. Tianming also lit a cigarette with a kerosene lamp and choked on it after taking a puff. He rubbed the cigarette on the sole of his shoe twice.
0:42:32|0:42:50|Tianming was already falling asleep, responding with words here and there. Before long, both of them had entered dreamland. But at this moment, You Tianming's foot accidentally knocked over the kerosene lamp on the side, igniting the straw instantly.
0:42:54|0:43:5|A villager saw the fire, and [You Tianming] quickly woke up [Lan Yu]. [You Tianming] immediately went to get the lock placed aside.
0:43:41|0:43:59|You Tianming, with a disheveled appearance and a furrowed brow, lowered his head and dared not speak. Beside him, Lan Yu looked at You Tianming with pity, then glanced down at the lock in her hand and mustered up the courage to speak.
0:44:6|0:44:22|His master's expression changed, but You Tianming still kept his head down. [Shiniang] turned and left.
0:44:43|0:44:59|The summer heat fades away, the frozen earth, the passing of spring and autumn, another year has come. [Shiniang] imparts knowledge and skills, at that river bend, the master and disciples spent day after day. In the courtyard of [Shiniang]'s home, [You Tianming] and [Lan Yu] play a duet in front of the ancestral tablet.
0:45:4|0:45:23|Today is the day of the Jiao Sanye family's passing on of the mantle. The passing on of the mantle is the ceremony where the head of the family determines the successor. He is passing on not only the skills of the White Bird's Mockery, but also a kind of honor. It is the best affirmation of a performer's character and artistry.
0:45:35|0:45:55|The courtyard was filled with members of the [Jiao family troupe], Brother Er's parents, and other villagers. After years of practice, the two of them had become very skilled in their acrobatic memory, performing with more confidence. The people in the courtyard listened with smiles on their faces, unable to resist swaying to the rhythm.
0:45:55|0:46:3|After the performance, the two children immediately ran to find their parents. Everyone praised the performance of these two young cellists.
0:46:7|0:46:16|[Jiao Sanye] walked out of the house, holding a cloth-wrapped harmonica in his hand.
0:47:48|0:47:51|[Jiao Sanye] takes out the Sonar from the cloth bag.
0:48:30|0:48:33|[Jiao Sanye] waved towards [You Tianming].
0:48:35|0:48:40|[You Tianming] was momentarily stunned, while a confident [Lan Yu] also had a look of disbelief on her face.
0:48:42|0:48:50|Upon his father's reminder, [You Tianming] walked up to the master, causing [Lan Yu] to deflate instantly. The master bent down and spoke to [You Tianming].
0:49:46|0:49:50|Shiniang stands up to comfort Lan Yu.
0:50:8|0:50:16|[Jiao Sanye] shook his pipe over the sole of his shoe, placed it on the table, and then got up and went back to his room.
0:50:20|0:50:23|[Shiniang] holds [Lan Yu]'s hand and continues to comfort him.
0:50:27|0:50:37|The next morning, [Lan Yu] packed up his luggage and stood in the courtyard.
0:50:52|0:50:55|[You Tianming] walked out of the room, reluctant to look at his junior brother.
0:51:1|0:51:4|After kowtowing, Shiniang quickly helped him up.
0:51:11|0:51:24|[Lan Yu], holding back tears, [Shiniang] also felt reluctant, forced a smile, waved goodbye to [Lan Yu]. [Lan Yu] had reached the gate, when [You Tianming] called out to him.
0:51:26|0:51:49|Lan Yu turned to look at [You Tianming], who shed tears. Lan Yu decisively turned around and left the master's house, walking alone on the rural path. [You Tianming] chased to the door and watched her leave, with [Shiniang] also following. At this moment, [Jiao Sanye] appeared at the street corner.
0:51:58|0:52:14|In the following days, the master taught [You Tianming] to play the bamboo flute. In this small farmhouse courtyard, the master sat on a stool, with [You Tianming] standing in front of him, still following the master's tune, playing along.
0:52:39|0:52:51|The locked bowl, like a blooming flower, emitted a clear sound. As he continued to blow, [You Tianming] had grown from a young man into a youth.
0:53:2|0:53:7|[Jiao Sanye] passes on the Jiao family's skills to the young [You Tianming] in the hall.
0:53:33|0:53:35|But when this day really comes,
0:54:2|0:54:11|You Ben excitedly ran back home. In Tianming's house, Sixi lit a cigarette for You Ben.
0:54:37|0:54:39|Xiuzhi came out to pour water for Sixi.
0:55:6|0:55:14|[You Tianming] brought the You family gang to the wedding scene of his childhood friend Changsheng. Tianming saw the groom Changsheng with a big red flower on his chest and said,
0:55:31|0:55:36|[You Tianming] doesn't smoke and politely declined Changsheng's offer. Changsheng then distributed the cigarettes to others.
0:56:10|0:56:31|Following Jiao Sanye all the way, at this moment, the two newcomers kneel and bow in front of the ancestral hall. Liu Jiabang has been playing in the courtyard all along. Sixi hands out cigars to the members of Liu Jiabang. Liu Jiabang's shot is placed on the table, while other senior brothers directly hand the cigars to the courtyard. Tang Sheng walks over.
0:56:44|0:57:6|Changsheng gave everyone red envelopes. You Tianming's red envelope was different from others, containing a hundred yuan bill. Brother Er happily counted his red envelopes. You Tianming stood up and gave everyone another hundred yuan.
0:57:13|0:57:34|Everyone was very satisfied, and someone even kissed a banknote directly. In [Jiao Sanye]'s house, [Shiniang] was in front of the stove, breaking open a steamed bun, adding some vegetables inside, wrapping it in cloth, and occasionally putting the vegetables that fell on the stove into her mouth.
0:57:36|0:57:51|[Shiniang] shouted while wrapping up the glass jar containing porridge. She walked out of the kitchen with the meal. The dog Niu Niu was standing at the door with two cloth bags draped over her. [Shiniang] packed the lunch into the bags.
0:57:54|0:58:4|Niuniu ran out of the house with her lunch, ran across the field path, and plunged into the vegetable garden. [Jiao Sanye] was working in the vegetable garden.
0:58:7|0:58:12|He took out lunch from Jiao Jiao's bag and was about to eat.
0:58:24|0:58:33|[Shiniang] put the lunch back into Jiao Jiao's cloth bag. Inside the house, [Shiniang] squatted on the ground, washing and wiping the feet of [Jiao Sanye] who had just returned from the fields.
0:58:36|0:58:40|[Jiao Sanye] put on his shoes and walked into the hall.
1:0:36|1:0:38|In the evening, [Shiniang] is weaving cloth in front of the loom.
1:0:42|1:0:48|[Shifu] found a jar of rare old wine covered in a layer of dust.
1:1:2|1:1:23|[Jiao Sanye] carefully wiped the blanket with a cloth, then gently unfolded the red cloth covering the mouth of the blanket. [You Tianming] moved the wine cup closer to [Shiniang], who then took out a sieve, sniffed it, and then offered it to [You Tianming] to smell.
1:1:24|1:1:28|[Shifu] poured wine into the bowl very carefully, afraid of spilling a drop.
1:1:35|1:1:37|After finishing speaking, he quickly plugged the cork back in. Master and disciple raised their glasses, both took a small sip first, and then continued to drink a big gulp.
1:2:52|1:3:9|Come, most of the five bowls of homestyle dishes on the table have been eaten, and we've had three rounds of drinks. [Jiao Sanye] has had a bit too much to drink, and he opens the precious box containing the Sona.
1:3:15|1:3:18|He took out the delicate Qing Dynasty suona.
1:3:39|1:3:46|Xiaosi Xiansun knelt down in gratitude, overwhelmed with thanks.
1:3:57|1:4:2|Fueled by alcohol, [Jiao Sanye] played a cheerful tune on the flute, dancing like a child as he played.
1:4:8|1:4:18|Beside, Shenyang, who was weaving, showed a simple and happy smile. But suddenly, Jiao Sanye also exhausted, knelt down on the ground.
1:4:37|1:4:58|Tianming went up to help, but Jiao Sanye pushed his hand away. Jiao Sanye fell directly to the ground, and You Tianming and Shiniang hurried over.
1:5:2|1:5:7|Master Jiao Sanye was actually drunk and asleep, with a slight smile on the corner of his mouth.
1:5:18|1:5:30|[You Tianming] stayed at [Shifu]'s house for one night. The next morning, [Tianming] got up and walked into the courtyard, shouting while putting on his shirt.
1:5:34|1:5:49|No one was at home. [You Tianming] came to the kitchen, lifted the lid of the pot on the stove, inside was a bowl of sweet potatoes left for him by [Shiniang], still steaming. He took one in his hand and started eating. Then he walked out of the kitchen into the main hall.
1:5:53|1:6:9|Put the sweet potato on the table, then took out all the money from his pocket. He counted it, intending to leave only the whole coins, but hesitated for a moment, put all the money on the table, and used the old radio of [Shiniang] to press it down.
1:6:13|1:6:22|[Master] and [Shiniang] have been working in the field, [You Tianming] arrived at the vegetable field with his luggage, but he just took a glance from afar and continued on his way.
1:6:29|1:6:45|Still the same narrow path where her father brought her to apprentice. In You Tianming's current stride, there is a hint of determination and responsibility. In You Tianming's home, his sister Xiuzhi, wearing a floral dress, hurriedly walked into the yard, getting ready to ride her bike to work.
1:6:51|1:6:59|The mother put the lunchbox in her bicycle basket and met the just-returned Tianming at the door.
1:7:55|1:8:11|In the bustling market of Wushuang Town, You Tianming arrived at a stall and picked up a small item to examine. Suddenly, someone covered his eyes from behind, and he turned around.
1:8:25|1:8:27|In the evening, Brother Er and Jiao Sanye were drinking and eating in Lan Yu's yard.
1:9:8|1:9:20|[You Tianming] lowered his head and smiled helplessly. [Lan Yu] drank another cup.
1:10:6|1:10:16|[Lan Lan] got up and went into the room to take out her wallet. She took out a photo from the wallet. It was a picture of [Lan Lan] and Xiuzhi.
1:10:30|1:10:35|[Lan Lan] took a bite of the food and said.
1:10:54|1:11:1|The next day, the companions of the You family in the forest cave were offering various foods and wine for the old man's birthday celebration.
1:11:22|1:11:37|Then cigarettes were passed around to everyone. The foreign band started tuning their instruments. [Lan Lan] mentioned there was also a sexy female singer standing on the stage.
1:11:47|1:12:7|[You Tianming] stood up and walked towards the foreign band. With his eyes fixed on the performance of the foreign band, [You Tianming] walked forward. In front of the foreign band, many lively citizens had already gathered. The drumsticks were hitting the drums on the stand, in coordination with the other band members.
1:13:5|1:13:27|The master could hardly recognize the grown-up [Lan Yu], and awkwardly smiled. At this moment, more and more people returned to the foreigner's place. It turned out that a female singer started singing. The female singer was dressed in a leopard-print tight dress, wearing a necklace, and styled in a happy and fashionable manner.
1:13:45|1:13:47|[Jiao Sanye] said angrily.
1:13:55|1:13:58|You Tianming took the wine bottle directly and took a sip.
1:14:2|1:14:5|The sudden sound of the suona startled the female singer on stage.
1:14:52|1:15:20|In front of the Eastern Band, there were layers of audience, contrasting sharply with the deserted wanderers. In the crowd, a young man with a wonderful mirror was not willing to disturb his classmates. He led his little brother to [You Tianming]. He patted [You Tianming] on the shoulder, but [You Tianming] ignored him.
1:15:49|1:15:52|Jiao Sanye rose with a punch, also giving Lan Yu a heavy blow.
1:16:26|1:16:46|Everyone stopped, and the foreign band also stopped playing. [Jiao Sanye] looked around in dismay and saw the scattered and deformed harmonicas on the ground that had been stepped on. He picked them up with a heartache, held them in his hand, and gazed into the distance with a dazed look.
1:16:53|1:16:59|[Jiao Sanye] walked out of the Lei family with his hands behind his back, followed by [Lan Yu] and the You family troupe.
1:17:1|1:17:17|[Jiao Sanye] ignored them, and everyone stopped following. [Lan Lan] put her hand on [You Tianming]'s shoulder to comfort him. [Jiao Sanye] walked briskly alone on the country road, his gradually receding figure appearing lonely and desolate.
1:17:19|1:17:33|In the home of You Tianming, his mother brewed a pot of Chinese medicine and poured it into a bowl. Tianming sat on the bed and drank it down, then rinsed his mouth with some water. His mother touched Tianming's forehead.
1:17:35|1:17:39|The mother arranged the pillow for Tianming to lie down.
1:17:48|1:17:55|The mother poured water into a bowl.
1:18:33|1:18:38|The father closed the box with his foot and walked out carrying an iron bucket.
1:18:44|1:18:50|The father looked towards the gate and asked, "Who died?"
1:19:38|1:19:41|You Tianming is at a loss. At this moment, Jiao Sanye learned the news and rushed to You Tianming's home in a fit of anger. By this time, he was already very ill.
1:20:5|1:20:19|[Jiao Sanye] was emotionally agitated, muttering a few words. For a moment, he couldn't catch his breath and leaned on the flower stand next to him. [You Tianming] hurried over and gently patted his master's back. [Jiao Sanye] turned around and sat on the flower stand.
1:21:5|1:21:8|[Shiniang] rushed out and then turned around.
1:21:12|1:21:19|[You Tianming] followed the master out. [Jiao Sanye] kicked open the iron gate of [Brother Er]'s house and rushed into the courtyard.
1:21:26|1:21:42|[Brother Er] looked at [Jiao Sanye] with a mixture of fear and guilt, as he packed his bags to leave. [Jiao Sanye] directly threw the clothes that had already been packed into the snake skin bag out, some of them landing directly on [You Tianming]'s head.
1:21:42|1:21:54|Brother Er's mother is bedridden, and she sees Jiao Sanye throwing clothes vigorously through the window. Brother Er stands by, his body trembling slightly, as Jiao Sanye empties the clothes from the bag.
1:21:57|1:22:24|The pig raised at home ran out of the pigsty, wearing a piece of clothing. Brother Er walked over, drove it away, picked up the scattered clothes in the yard one by one, and even knelt down to pick up the clothes. He picked up a handful of clothes and wanted to put them back in the bag, but Jiao Sanye stepped on the bag with one foot.
1:22:24|1:22:48|[Brother Er] looked up at the master and then bowed his head to pull the bag harder, but [Jiao Sanye] stepped even harder. In the end, [Jiao Sanye] kicked [Brother Er] to the side, and inside the house, the sick mother trembled her lips and shed tears. [Brother Er] supported his body with his arms, his nose bleeding.
1:22:50|1:23:11|He wiped his nose with his hand and then looked at his master. [Jiao Sanye] calmed down, feeling a bit sorry for his disciple who was injured, and turned his head away. He then glanced at [Brother Er] before walking out of the house in silence. [You Tianming] quickly caught up with him.
1:23:11|1:23:16|At sunset in the west, [Jiao Sanye] walks on the path with his persuaded disciple and [You Tianming].
1:23:24|1:23:29|Big Brother stopped in his tracks and waited for [You Tianming] to approach from behind, then spoke to him.
1:23:38|1:23:49|[You Tianming] did not respond and continued to follow the master. [Jiao Sanye] led his disciples to Huozhuang and met You Ben Sheng, who was carrying a drum at the village entrance.
1:23:54|1:23:58|[Jiao Sanye] lit three incense sticks at the memorial hall and paid his respects to Village Chief Dou.
1:24:10|1:24:19|Village Chief Dou fought against the Japanese devils and taught bandits. He had four ribs broken by a stone.
1:24:37|1:24:41|The descendants of Village Chief Dou sent this letter to [Jiao Sanye].
1:24:54|1:25:1|The villagers stared at the somewhat unfamiliar face, [You Tianming] stood up nervously as his father walked over.
1:25:5|1:25:7|Brother Er said to Jiao Sanye.
1:25:11|1:25:30|[Jiao Sanye] looked at [You Tianming], his cheeks flushed and covered in cold sweat due to a fever. After a moment of contemplation, [Jiao Sanye] stood up and said, "Everyone has seen it, the leader of the You family troupe is sick, so let's not mock him with the White Bird tune immediately."
1:25:38|1:25:45|[You Tianming] locked the ground for the master, who was sitting on the central grandmaster chair, and gestured to the disciples.
1:25:54|1:26:13|[Jiao Sanye] blew the white bird taunt with all his might. Sonar was crying and complaining, moving both the descendants of Dou Village and other villagers. You Tianming was assisting his master on the side.
1:27:47|1:28:4|Suddenly, [You Tianming] noticed that there were drops of bloody red liquid flowing out of the master's sona bowl. With his keen senses, [Jiao Sanye] also noticed the blood. Unable to hold back, he coughed twice and spat out a mouthful of blood.
1:28:8|1:28:11|Disciples gathered around, with villagers watching anxiously.
1:28:21|1:28:29|The disciples brought the drum in front of [Jiao Sanye]. The master adjusted his clothes, preparing to beat the drum.
1:28:33|1:28:38|[Jiao Sanye] said to [You Tianming]. Unable to persuade the stubborn [Jiao Sanye], everyone had to continue playing.
1:28:56|1:29:15|[Jiao Sanye] first leaned against it to knock, and later stood up like everyone else. He looked up at Tianming, who was playing with great dedication, tears shimmering in his eyes. A contented smile appeared on [Jiao Sanye]'s pale face, and he then knocked with even more endurance.
1:29:59|1:30:3|[You Tianming] looked dazed, unable to accept it for a moment.
1:30:9|1:30:11|[You Tianming]’s eyes were filled with despair.
1:30:12|1:30:31|Later, [Jiao Sanye] lay on a wooden pie car, [You Tianming] and two senior brothers climbed over the rugged mountain road together, and brought the master back home.
1:30:46|1:30:56|At night, under dim lights, [Jiao Sanye] is in the cowshed, brushing the cows with a brush. He says to [You Tianming],
1:31:4|1:31:13|The next day, a drizzle fell from the sky, and [Jiao Sanye] struggled to cover the cow's back with a blanket.
1:31:18|1:31:29|[You Tianming] set off with the cow. [Shiniang] chased after him, unwilling to watch the cow go far away.
1:31:33|1:31:42|You Tianming placed the money from selling the cow on Jiao Sanye's bedside, bought a pair of shoes for the master, and Shiniang sat by the bed. Jiao Sanye didn't even have the strength to shake his head.
1:32:45|1:32:55|Before going to bed at night, You Tianming helps his master wipe his body on the bed. Jiao Sanye is still obsessed with the locked pouch.
1:33:14|1:33:28|[Jiao Sanye] found some comfort. Seeing the master coughing severely, Tianming and [Shiniang] quickly helped him up to ease his breathing. [Jiao Sanye] was already leaning on Tianming's arm, slowly recovering.
1:33:46|1:33:53|[Shiniang] couldn't hold back anymore, turned around, and secretly wiped away her tears.
1:34:10|1:34:18|You Tianming pressed his face against his master's face and started crying. The next day, You Bensheng went to Jiao Sanye's house.
1:34:22|1:34:25|This is the deputy director of the County Cultural Bureau.
1:34:50|1:34:52|Li Wu is drinking Chinese medicine, and [Jiao Sanye] hears it.
1:35:9|1:35:27|A train enters the scene, and You Tianming arrives in Xi'an from Tianming City. He rushes around the streets and finally finds a construction site of an ancient building, led by Brother Er. Lan Yu, Lan Yu from childhood, and Shiniang are all on the roof.
1:35:30|1:35:38|At night, Brother Er was cooking in the kitchen of the construction site dormitory. He served the last dish on the table, while Jiao Sanye played the suona beside him.
1:35:41|1:35:44|Former brothers sat around together.
1:35:52|1:35:56|[Brother Er] picked up a steamed bun, and Tianming noticed an abnormality on his brother's ring finger.
1:36:1|1:36:3|Xiuzhi turned her head and whispered.
1:36:10|1:36:13|[Brother Er] covered his disabled left hand and said despondently. Suddenly, Jiao Sanye started coughing violently, and [Lan Yu] gently patted his back.
1:36:35|1:36:42|Niu Tianming remained silent with his head down. The next day, Tianming, Xiuzhi, and [Lan Lan] took a walk in front of Yongning Gate.
1:37:23|1:37:29|[Lan Lan] and Xiuzhi couldn't do anything about You Tianming. Suddenly, they were attracted by the sound of the suona.
1:37:31|1:37:41|Not far away, there is a thin old man playing the suona, with a tea jar beside him. Two young girls walk over and put some coins into the tea jar.
1:37:48|1:37:51|[You Tianming] saw this scene, feeling a mix of emotions in his heart.
1:37:58|1:38:4|Remaining, the lush green rice seedlings and the green pines covering the mountains appear vibrant and full of life.
1:38:12|1:38:25|Ding A'niu was also crouching beside the tombstone. [You Tianming] was alone, wearing a red vest that only he would wear, and tying a red silk ribbon around his waist, playing the Hundred Birds Mocking for his master.
1:38:26|1:38:54|He seemed to see his master sitting on the grandmaster's chair, with a stern appearance hiding a passionate heart. [Jiao Sanye] saw Liu Chunming's shoulder and smiled with relief. The scenes of studying sonar with the master in the past vividly appeared before his eyes.
1:38:56|1:39:8|Master's proud and smiling face is forever engraved in Tianming's heart. In the small courtyard of the master's house, the young Tianming followed the master to learn swordsmanship sentence by sentence, unknowingly accumulating a whole night.
1:39:55|1:40:15|Upon becoming Mengzi, You Tianming returned to his master's house for the first time. His master was drunk, so happy that he acted like a child with his hands blocking his head.
1:40:50|1:41:8|You Tianming in front of the grave was already in tears. Jiao Sanye stood up from the grandmaster chair, with a look of reluctance, turned around, took big strides towards the distance alone, gradually disappearing from the frame.
