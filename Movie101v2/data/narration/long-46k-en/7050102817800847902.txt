0:1:24|0:1:32|He reached out his rough fingers to touch the scars, each scar telling a story of the hardships of survival.
0:1:34|0:1:58|Not far from the great river, a group of people with bare upper bodies and wearing animal skins are performing a special ritual. Behind them stands a tall altar, this is the [You Xiong Tribe]. The [You Xiong Tribe] is a clan in the ancient Huaxia tribes. Due to scarce resources at that time, there was competition between tribes, so each tribe was far apart, even separated by a river. Each tribe had its own unique skills. In order to survive, tribes could exchange items with each other to obtain necessities of life.
0:1:58|0:2:15|[The Bear Clan] is skilled in making ceramics. On this day, in order to exchange for necessities from other tribes across the river, the tribal leader selected a few brave individuals to go to the other side of the river to trade salt with [The Shen Nong Clan]. The wide river water was murky, and the angry waves kept churning. It was unknown how many people had drowned here.
0:2:15|0:2:32|To cross the river, one can only rely on luck. In order to bless someone to cross the river this time, the tribe members performed an ancient ritual. They knelt on the ground, hands raised up, and then began to kowtow. [Emperor] tribe leader held a scepter and waved it continuously towards the sky, repeating this action endlessly.
0:2:32|0:2:53|At this moment, six people carried a wooden raft made of an inflatable skin into the crowd. The raft was filled with flowers, and a woman on the raft wore a floral wreath, sitting cross-legged with her hands raised high, singing an ancient folk song. The people carrying the raft then slowly walked towards the riverbank, their feet covered in moist mud. When they reached the shore, they raised their hands and threw the raft into the river.
0:2:53|0:3:12|The woman on the raft remained calm as it was tossed around in the water, until a big wave overturned the raft and she was submerged. The leader of the [You Xiong] tribe looked up at the sky.
0:3:15|0:3:29|The clan leader shouted a special slogan, followed by the young people passing through the kneeling tribesmen, holding inflatable skins in their hands and rushing towards the river. Among them, [Ji Di] took the lead, his eyes firm, shouting slogans to boost his courage, and then jumped into the river without hesitation.
0:3:29|0:3:51|At this moment, [Mo], a woman from the [Youxiong] tribe, ran over from a distance. She knelt on the ground, anxiously looking at the young man crossing the river. The clear river water splashed violently, and after struggling for a while, the young man gradually lost his strength. Even the life-saving skin bag began to escape in all directions. Without the protection of the skin bag, the young men were instantly submerged by the river. [Mo] couldn't help but feel anxious, folding her hands together in silent prayer.
0:3:54|0:4:6|At this moment, [Jidi] struggled to come out of the water with the skin bag in her arms. As she took a deep breath and turned to look at the others, she noticed the whirlpool in the water, quickly pulling several tribe members into the riverbed. [Momu] hurriedly knelt on the ground, afraid that her distraction might anger the gods.
0:4:6|0:4:34|When he looked up, the turbulent water surface was empty except for a few inflatable skins. Suddenly, [Jidi] emerged from the water. At this point, he was the only survivor as his life-saving skin was washed away. [Jidi] took deep breaths and swam quickly to the other side of the river. [Momu] knelt down again, then looked up to see no one in the river except for a few scattered skins. She stood up slowly, kept looking across the river, and suddenly smiled.
0:4:38|0:4:46|The tribespeople were amazed, they quickly stood up and looked across the river, [Mother Mo] excitedly ran a few steps forward. He watched as [Princess Di] was about to come ashore, shouting loudly.
0:4:56|0:5:7|The clan leader gasped for breath, finally letting go of the suspended heart. The joyful [Mother Mo] called his name over and over again, as [Ji Di] climbed ashore and turned to look at the people on the opposite bank. He raised his hands and shouted.
0:5:13|0:5:18|The tribespeople were instantly ecstatic, dancing with joy, knowing that crossing the river would enable them to exchange for essential goods.
0:5:18|0:5:33|In their eyes, this is the hope of survival. After narrowly escaping death, [Jidi] slowly regained consciousness, gasping for breath. He then knelt down slowly on the ground, and the tribal leader raised his scepter in gratitude. [Jidi] also raised his hands and then kowtowed heavily to [Huangdi].
0:5:33|0:5:41|At this moment, the sky was flashing with thunder and lightning, as lines converged to form four majestic characters, "Emperor Xuanyuan".
0:5:41|0:5:58|[Jidi] arrived at the Shen Nong tribe bare-chested and carrying a weapon on his back. The atmosphere here was peaceful, with male tribe members working together in the fields with farming tools, while female tribe members held a pot of seeds in their hands, sprinkling a few grains on the ground and then stomping on them with their feet.
0:6:3|0:6:18|[Jidi] looked up at the people planting the land, then looked down at the soil. He picked up some moist soil, examined it repeatedly in his hand, while the other tribe members were busy making salt. The finished salt caught [Jidi]'s attention, and he grabbed a handful and put it in his mouth.
0:6:35|0:6:43|The local tribespeople walked up to [Jidi]. One of them picked up a basin and scooped a basin full of salt.
0:6:44|0:6:53|The tribespeople felt somewhat puzzled, and one of them glanced at [Jidi], then bent down to pick up the item that [Jidi] had put down.
0:6:55|0:7:1|[Jidi] finished exchanging the salt and arrived at the local market, where the dazzling array of goods made him feel incredibly fresh.
0:7:1|0:7:24|In the market, there are daily necessities, jade-like gems brought back by the fur-hunting warriors, specimens of deer and cow heads displayed in disorder, attracting special attention. The wandering tribes carefully select goods on the wooden tower, with cow head specimens hanging on top and two farming tools crossed at the top, which is the symbol of the Shen Nong tribe. The women in the tribe are also busy.
0:7:24|0:7:39|They lined up, holding winding sticks to create neat rows of lines, then interweaving them together. The men worked in pairs to make pottery, with one shaping the clay and the other spinning the wheel, while a tribesman poured grains into a bowl.
0:7:45|0:7:58|The woman with long hair placed the bowl on a wooden stump, and Zuyé washed his hands to the side. It turned out that Zuyé was the leader of the Shen Nong tribe, [Jiang Yan]. [Ji Di] walked straight through the crowd towards him. Seeing a stranger approaching, [Jiang Yan] stood up warily with the bowl in his hands.
0:8:5|0:8:12|[Ji Di] stared straight at the rice in [Jiang Yan]'s hand.
0:8:15|0:8:25|He had long been starving and ate without any reservation. The well-fed tribesmen were playing with stones by the river, unaware of the imminent danger approaching. In the nearby forest, only a few figures in animal skins could be seen.
0:8:25|0:8:37|The mysterious figure with a thin bone structure slowly approached them, walking through the dense mountain forest with light footsteps, afraid of alarming the local tribespeople. The tribespeople, oblivious to their presence, continued to work and chat happily.
0:8:37|0:8:59|The mysterious figure held sharp weapons such as long knives and axes, ready to make a move. The leader had five stripes painted on his face, with a fierce look in his eyes as he stared intently at the river. Suddenly, he signaled, and the hidden mysterious figures slowly emerged from the water. In the forest, the mysterious figures slowly raised their weapons as the leader gave a signal.
0:8:59|0:9:13|The people lying in ambush in the river leaped out like ghosts. By the time [Shennong] who was working on the riverbank saw them, it was already too late. The women weaving nearby heard the commotion and looked around in panic. The mysterious figures all rushed out with weapons, launching a fierce attack.
0:9:14|0:9:38|The enemy attacked, the man with long hair pushed his companion away with force, and the next second he was stabbed to death by the enemy. Seeing this, the scene became even more chaotic and restless. The mysterious man searched every corner like a wild beast, crazily killing. The tribe protected the elder [Jiang Yan] and quickly fled. [Ji Di], who was still eating, looked bewildered at everything. The mysterious man overturned the shelves blocking the way, and the ceramics poured all over the ground. Some of the tribe members helped [Jiang Yan] escape, while others...
0:9:38|0:10:2|Desperately resisting, at this moment [Jidi] held a pottery jar squatting next to the shelf. When the mysterious person approached, he suddenly flew the pottery jar in his hand towards the mysterious person, smashing it fiercely. The tribesmen who couldn't escape were stabbed by the enemy, and blood gushed out instantly. The excited enemy picked up a real hammer and crazily smashed the tribesmen. The tribesmen who were moved were thrown off the high platform by the enemy, who then jumped down and crazily hammered for less than a quarter of an hour, [Shennong] was defeated and fled.
0:10:2|0:10:20|The fearful cries echoed in the air mingled with the cold sound of weapons, bodies scattered on the ground. The mysterious leader swaggered into the tribe, looking around trying to retrieve some loot. Suddenly, he stopped in his tracks, picked up a loom from the ground and examined it closely, then threw it down fiercely. On the other side...
0:10:20|0:10:35|The tribesman who narrowly escaped death supported the elderly tribal leader [Jiang Yan] and ran into the mountains. Not far away, a group of people was waiting for them. When they saw [Jiang Yan], they immediately ran to greet him and helped the injured tribesman. [Jiang Yan] was supported to sit on a stone stool, panting heavily after the long journey.
0:11:0|0:11:14|[Jiang Yan] looked over, his mouth wide open in fear, as he trembled and stood up with the help of a cane. A burly man with a horn on his head, thick eyebrows and big eyes, was slowly approaching carrying a long-handled stone axe, his eyes filled with murderous intent.
0:11:14|0:11:31|The recently escaped tribesmen were so frightened that their lips turned white, breathing heavily. They raised their weapons in front of their chests, preparing for battle, but their bodies kept retreating in fear. It turned out that the burly man was Chi You, a member of the Jiuli tribe, and the mysterious invaders were all Jiuli tribesmen who invaded the tribe of Shennong.
0:11:31|0:11:40|At this moment, a member of the Shen Nong clan bravely shouted and ran towards [Chi You] with a weapon in hand. [Chi You] kicked with tremendous force, causing the clan member to collapse instantly.
0:11:40|0:11:49|The companion, seeing the situation, raised a stone axe to help. [Chiyou], calm and collected, grabbed the long-handled stone axe and fiercely smashed it into his waist. Falling to the ground, he struggled to get up and once again challenged [Chiyou]. [Chiyou] ruthlessly chopped towards his neck.
0:11:52|0:12:3|Blood gushed out instantly, and another member of the tribe, in retaliation, picked up a weapon without hesitation and struck at [Chiyou]'s arm. Surprisingly, [Chiyou] was unharmed, and in response, he grabbed an axe and delivered a fatal blow, causing the onlookers to quickly turn and flee.
0:12:3|0:12:26|[Chiyou] remained calm and collected, pulling out the long-handled stone axe embedded in a person's body and chasing after the others. Due to unfamiliar terrain, the Shen Nong clan members ran into a dead end, with [Chiyou] surrounding them from the opposite direction. Suddenly, a clan member in front lunged towards [Chiyou], who swung his long-handled weapon to break the clan member's weapon, causing the broken weapon to hit the head of a clan member behind him. With [Chiyou] closing in step by step, a terrified [Jiang Yan] slowly moved backwards.
0:12:26|0:12:38|He suddenly looked behind [Chiyou] and saw [Jidi] holding a stone hammer, launching a surprise attack on [Chiyou]. [Chiyou] grabbed a stone axe to defend himself, but the axe was chopped off a large piece, and [Jidi]'s weapon also broke in half.
0:12:41|0:12:56|The tribespeople quickly fled, [Chiyou] tried to catch up, but [Jidi] swiftly threw the handle of the hammer at [Chiyou], hitting him on the head. Enraged, he picked up a stone axe and swung it towards [Jidi]. She agilely dodged, and as [Chiyou] swung the axe again, she continued to evade. [Chiyou] seemed to be toyed with.
0:12:56|0:13:23|He once again fiercely smashed [Jidi]'s abdomen, this time he was heavily pressed against a tree. [Chiyou] prepared to pursue the victory, but when he swung the stone axe again, [Jidi] perfectly dodged it. Seizing the opportunity while [Chiyou] was distracted, he turned around and punched [Chiyou] in the head. Changing tactics, he pulled out the sword from his waist and stabbed [Chiyou] in the thigh. Enduring the pain, [Chiyou] lifted [Jidi] and threw him to the ground. Seeing him lying on the ground, [Chiyou] picked up the axe and launched another attack. [Jidi] rolled to the side to escape the danger.
0:13:23|0:13:34|The large tree behind them unexpectedly had a deep notch cut out of it, and at the same time, the axe was broken in two. [Ji Di] stood up slowly in fear, while [Chi You] acted unusually by throwing away the main weapon, and finally gave a sinister smile.
0:13:34|0:13:52|[Jidi] felt a sense of danger, turned around and saw a black bear with its mouth wide open rushing towards him. [Jidi] quickly dodged, rolled into the nearby bushes, ignoring the wounds on his body, quickly got up and looked at the black bear. At this moment, the black bear stared at [Jidi] with sharp fangs exposed, emitting a terrifying roar as if it was threatening and provoking [Jidi].
0:13:52|0:14:10|[Jidi] was not afraid at all. On the contrary, he raised his hands and bowed to the black bear [Momu]. Seeing this, [Chiyou] smirked, but the black bear stopped roaring as if understanding something, turned its head, and [Chiyou] looked in surprise as the black bear then whistled. The black bear, as if receiving a command, snapped back to reality and pounced towards [Jidi].
0:14:10|0:14:19|[Jidi] swiftly turned and ran into the forest, with Heixiong hot on her heels. Unable to shake him off, [Jidi] changed direction, leaped and disappeared into a slope.
0:14:19|0:14:30|Motionless, [Ji Di] observed the black bear. As soon as the bear noticed, the figure stopped and looked around in all directions. When it turned its head and spotted [Ji Di] hiding, it immediately opened its mouth wide and lunged forward. Seeing this, [Ji Di] quickly dodged and ran in the opposite direction.
0:14:30|0:14:39|The woman with spots on her face grabbed the vine hanging down from the tree, following closely behind [Jidi], but did not reach out to help. [Jidi] sensed the danger.
0:14:39|0:14:48|He ran while pulling out an arrow from behind and shot her in the back. The enraged woman opened her arms in a cheetah-like posture and pounced towards [Jidi], only to be knocked down by [Jidi] with a stick.
0:14:48|0:15:0|At this moment, the black bear heard the sound and rushed over. It quickly pounced on [Jidi], causing [Jidi] to panic and stumble. In the process, the bow and arrow she carried fell to the ground. Without hesitation, [Jidi] quickly adjusted her posture and stood up to escape.
0:15:0|0:15:15|Suddenly stopped in front of a big tree, looked up at the tree, then turned to look at the bear behind, suddenly had an idea, took a few steps back and ran. Just as the black bear was about to catch up, [Ji Di] took a few quick steps and climbed up the tree. The chasing black bear hit the tree hard, let out a few weak cries, and then fell silent.
0:15:15|0:15:33|After seeing no danger, [Jidi] jumped down from the tree. At this moment, [Chiyou] and the mysterious woman from earlier arrived. [Jidi] was outnumbered, so he imitated the woman's actions and immediately grabbed a vine to swing a few times before disappearing into the forest.
0:15:46|0:15:50|The escaped high priest [Chiyou] was seriously injured, and the surviving members of the Shennong clan gathered around him.
0:16:8|0:16:22|The high priest closed his eyes tightly, without any swallowing movement. By now, he had stopped breathing. The eyes of the onlooker were filled with sorrow as he watched the high priest in a daze, then he stopped his actions and looked at the tribe members.
0:16:28|0:16:49|The high priest's face was covered in blood, but his expression was peaceful. Jiang [Yandi] silently lowered his head, his people furrowed their brows with tears in their eyes, mourning and wailing softly, then all knelt down. They opened their hands and bowed towards the direction of the high priest, remaining on their knees for a long time without getting up. The people could not believe that their respected high priest had left in this way.
0:16:49|0:17:1|After a while, Jiang [Emperor Yan] slowly raised his head and looked at the corpse of the high priest in front of him. His eyes suddenly became determined, and he trembled as he stood up with one hand on the tree trunk.
0:17:9|0:17:29|The morale of the tribe was ignited, they raised their weapons high and shouted loudly. Suddenly, a strange whistle sounded in the distance, and the tribespeople instantly quieted down, carefully discerning the direction of the whistle. They saw a woman standing on a tree, continuously whistling. In an instant, all the wolves and leopards in the forest mobilized and attacked the people of the Shennong tribe, who quickly gathered together.
0:17:31|0:17:46|The rest of the people quickly formed a human wall facing the fierce wolves and leopards. The ferocious wolves and leopards pounced on them with open mouths, tearing and biting. The weak villagers were no match for the vicious beasts. Some people, afraid and giving up resistance, stood still waiting to die.
0:17:46|0:17:57|The tribesman trying to escape was bitten on the leg by the wolves. A leopard attacked from behind, trapping the tribesman in a pincer movement. In order to save his life, the tribesman endured the pain and picked up a weapon to fiercely strike at the evil wolves.
0:17:57|0:18:15|The wolf let out a loud howl, then instantly released its mouth. The tribespeople seized the opportunity to stand up, and the wolf whimpered a few times before losing its life. Blood splattered all over the faces of the tribespeople. Feeling unsatisfied, he continued to hack a few more times. The whistle blower's expression turned serious in an instant. He blew the whistle again, and suddenly the wolves gathered together to attack the tribespeople. The others picked up weapons to come to the rescue.
0:18:15|0:18:25|The cheetah collapsed to the ground after being struck by a hammer, the tribe seemed to have found a way to deal with it, their momentum gradually rising. When the tiger attacked, the other companions would come to the rescue, and a hammer blow would kill the tiger.
0:18:25|0:18:48|The herd was gradually losing ground, the whistle blower was getting anxious. He leaped down from the tree, crouched on the ground in a fierce tiger pose, glaring at the [Shennong] tribe. Seeing the number of beasts decreasing, he blew the whistle again. The beasts that heard the whistle no longer attacked the crowd, but ran towards the mountains and forests. The forest after the fight was a mess, the exhausted tribe members lay motionless on the ground, covered in wounds from the bites. The herd ran to the whistle blower's side.
0:18:48|0:19:6|Surrounded by a group of dejected eyes, as if lamenting, the whistle-blower glanced at the injured beloved pet, then turned fiercely towards the direction of the [Shennong] tribe. The shallow water area far from the forest was strangely calm. At this moment, a bird was suddenly hit by a stone and fell into the water. It turned out to be [Jidi]. Without hesitation, he jumped into the water to retrieve the prey. As he walked to the center of the water,
0:19:6|0:19:23|Suddenly losing balance, he started swaying from side to side. Then his body slowly sank. It seemed to be a swampy area. He tried hard to walk towards the shore, but his body wouldn't cooperate. In the blink of an eye, the water was already over his neck. He exerted all his strength to lift his head as much as possible to breathe normally. He reached out his hand, seeking support.
0:19:23|0:19:33|Suddenly, a branch reached out and he firmly grasped it. It was [Xi Ling Lu Ming] who had extended the branch, along with [Lei]. [Ji Di] slowly revealed her head, and [Lei] turned around to speak to the road behind her.
0:19:34|0:19:44|At the other end of the branch, tied to two deer with a rope, they pulled hard forward, [Lei] followed behind the deer, also pulling the rope, sinking into the swamp, [Ji Di], frowning and gritting her teeth, trying to free her body as much as possible.
0:19:44|0:20:6|With the help of [Lei] and two deer, [Jidi] finally slowly exposed his neck and upper body. At this time, [Jidi] was half-lying in the mud, using his hands to crawl forward bit by bit. Seeing this, [Lei] threw down the rope in her hand to lift him up from the water. After a moment, [Lei] helped him to a safe place. The recovering [Jidi] held a round stone in his left hand, with several straight lines carved on it, and placed a wooden stick in the center of the lines with his right hand.
0:20:6|0:20:33|Then she kept turning the stone, [Lei] curiously glanced at what was in [Ji Di]'s hand. [Ji Di] turned the stick inserted in the sun-shadow stone with her hand, [Lei] looked at the sun, then looked puzzled at the stick.
0:20:41|0:20:51|[Nüwa] looked at Jidi with admiration in her eyes. She then took the daily food and drink into her own hands, carefully touching the carvings on the stone. It was then that she noticed a special symbol.
0:21:0|0:21:8|The two exchanged a smile, [Leizu] glanced down at the sun shadow stone, then looked thoughtfully at Jidi.
0:21:11|0:21:18|[Nuwa] smiled happily, when suddenly the sound of a horn rang out again. A deer flew past, closely followed by a fierce leopard.
0:21:20|0:21:42|[Leizu] ran towards the direction where the deer was fleeing, and Jidi quickly followed. While running, he pulled out an arrow from behind and shot it towards the cheetah. However, the cheetah ran too fast for the arrow to hit. Jidi then quickly took out a second arrow, but due to the weak bowstring, it fell to the ground before reaching the cheetah. In a flash, the cheetah leaped and knocked down a tree in its path. Jidi stepped on a piece of wood and jumped onto the tree, pulling out a third arrow to shoot at the cheetah, but still missed.
0:21:42|0:22:0|At this moment, the cheetah was devouring the deer meat, [Leizu] grabbed a long stick and charged forward, thrusting it into the cheetah's abdomen. The cheetah was enraged, it charged towards Ji Di who picked up a stick and thrust it into the cheetah's mouth. Ji Di forcefully pierced the stick through the cheetah's head and into a tree. The cheetah struggled for a few moments before breathing its last breath.
0:22:0|0:22:9|With a frightened look on her face, [Leizu] gasped for breath heavily. She squatted down and gently touched her pregnant belly. At the same time, [Jidi] hurried forward to check the situation.
0:22:12|0:22:22|Jidi looked down at the dead deer in frustration. He then noticed the arrow he had shot next to the deer, picked it up, and examined it remorsefully in his hand.
0:22:33|0:22:40|Ji Di suddenly realized and smiled at [Leizu], saying "Let's do it." [Leizu] tied the leopard tendon to the end of the bow, and then slowly pulled the tendon.
0:22:40|0:22:54|Jidi took the leopard tendon from Lv Zhi and quickly tied it to the head of the bow, then wrapped it a few times. He then handed the wrapped leopard tendon to [Leizu], who continued to wrap it around and left a piece to tie a knot, and then pulled it hard to make it more secure.
0:22:54|0:22:58|Jidi looked at the new bow and arrow, trying to pull the brand new bowstring a few times, which made him extremely excited.
0:23:1|0:23:16|[Leizu] took an arrow from the quiver behind Ji Di and handed it to him. He took it, placed it on the empty bowstring, aimed at a distant big tree, pulled with force, and the arrow firmly stuck into the trunk. The two of them excitedly ran over, and Ji Di carefully examined the sword stuck in the tree.
0:23:16|0:23:19|At this moment, [Leizu] looked back at the path she had come from, and then said to Jidi,
0:23:30|0:23:43|As the night fell, [Mother Mo] of the Xiong tribe lit a fire and started pounding stones in a house filled with cured meat. At that moment, Ji Jiu quietly lifted the door curtain and entered. He deliberately coughed, startling [Mother Mo], who then cautiously stood up. Ji Jiu took a deep breath.
0:23:46|0:23:58|Ji Jiu pushed her onto the stone couch behind her, then fiercely kissed her like a wolf, [Mother Mo] was unable to escape. At this moment, she lifted the stone in her hand and forcefully smashed it towards Ji Jiu's head, causing him to faint from the heavy blow.
0:23:58|0:24:15|[Mo Mu] pushed him aside, panting heavily. As the sky darkened, [Mo Mu] tied Ji Jiu's hands behind his back, hoisted him onto her shoulders, and carried him in front of the leader of the clan. She then threw him to the ground, and the clan leader looked at [Mo Mu] in confusion.
0:24:23|0:24:28|She kicked [Ji Jiu]'s butt and then walked away, while the tribe members looked at [Ji Jiu]'s miserable state and started mocking him.
0:24:28|0:24:48|Night falls, and the forest is occasionally filled with the sounds of animals. The centuries-old giant trees appear particularly quiet, their smooth trunks marked with scars carved by the passage of time. The large trunks have grown numerous branches, unevenly distributed, having experienced the storms of generations and witnessed the conflicts between tribes. Yet they remain so lush and vigorous, full of vitality.
0:24:48|0:24:57|A lush and majestic ancient tree with luxuriant branches and leaves, standing tall and proud in the sky, adding a layer of mysterious and deep tranquility to the entire mountain forest, with dreamlike and enchanting colors.
0:24:57|0:25:14|Jidi and [Queen Mother of the West] sat leisurely back to back on one of the branches, with the Queen Mother resting her head on Jidi's shoulder, looking happy. However, Jidi looked worried as he gazed into the distance and let out a long sigh.
0:25:16|0:25:32|[Leizu] stopped smiling and no longer leaned on Jidi's shoulder. Jidi, who didn't get a response, turned to look at her. Leizu, like a young girl, shyly lowered her head to think for a moment, then turned to look into Jidi's eyes.
0:25:33|0:25:50|She gazed affectionately at Ji Di, then took the initiative to kiss him. The sudden kiss caught Ji Di off guard like a storm, and he obediently closed his eyes, instinctively reaching out his hands, tightly embracing [Leizu]. [Leizu] reached out her hand, slowly stroking Ji Di's arm and placing it on his shoulder. The two embraced and kissed on the big tree, savoring the sweetness of the moment.
0:25:50|0:26:2|At this moment, a strange sound came from behind [Leizu], causing Ji Di to alertly open his eyes and look at a hundred-meter-long python behind him. Staring at them intently, Ji Di lost interest in continuing the kiss, his expression slowly becoming tense.
0:26:5|0:26:12|The flower-patterned python slithered closer with its tongue sticking out, as Ji Di slowly straightened up and slowly pulled out the flat weapon tied around her waist.
0:26:12|0:26:23|Due to fear, [Leizu] stood still, sweating profusely and swallowing saliva constantly. To make matters worse, at that moment, a leopard slowly approached him from behind after jumping down from a tree.
0:26:23|0:26:44|[Leizu] looked at the fierce leopard with widened eyes. Ji Di cautiously turned his head with a weapon in hand, only to see the leopard baring its fangs and glaring at him menacingly. With a python in front and a leopard behind, Ji Di remained calm and collected. He glanced at the tree branch above him and suddenly had an idea.
0:26:45|0:27:8|Ji Di reached out and embraced [Leizu]'s waist. The two slowly stood up from the tree. Just as the python let out a hiss, signaling an attack, the leopard heard the sound and immediately opened its mouth to pounce on the two. Ji Di and [Leizu] exchanged a glance, then simultaneously jumped and successfully landed on another branch. Without warning, the leopard and python collided instantly. The python swiftly wriggled its body and opened its mouth to feast, but lost balance and fell from the tree along with the fierce leopard.
0:27:8|0:27:14|Ji Di, who narrowly escaped death, continued on to the You Xiong family with [Leizu], and suddenly saw a stick stuck in a small tree ahead.
0:27:38|0:27:56|After a brief commotion, the two arrived at the riverbank. [Ji Di] took out a rope and tied it around [Leizu]'s waist, with the excess part tied around his own waist. He attempted to pull [Leizu] across the river. After preparing their gear, [Huangdi] looked up and smiled at [Leizu]. He then picked up two inflatable skins from the ground and handed them to [Leizu]. Despite the turbulent river filled with filthy mud and sand, the two showed no fear.
0:27:56|0:28:13|Soon after, the two of them jumped into the river one after the other, swimming towards the opposite bank where the Youxiong tribe resided. The lush forest was shrouded in thick fog, resembling a fairyland. On the other side of the river, just a river away from the Youxiong tribe, [Shennong] and the refugees walked barefoot with their heads down in a dejected manner, having lost their strength after a long journey.
0:28:13|0:28:28|[Jiang Yan] looked up and saw the people on the other side of the river, as if seeing hope, and walked towards the other side. At this time, You Xiongshi, who was washing jars by the river, looked up and saw them. Because [Shennongshi] was dressed differently from You Xiongshi, she alerted her companions and reported the news.
0:28:29|0:28:51|The Xiong clan people put down their work and watched vigilantly as the other side of the river stood up. The leader of the Da clan led his people carefully to the river bank to dispel the Xiong clan's concerns. To reassure them, [Jiang Yan] led the Shen Nong clan people a few steps forward.
0:29:25|0:29:31|[Shennong] placed his hands on his chest and bowed to You Xiong. The next day, [Jidi] and the other two also arrived at You Xiong's place.
0:29:32|0:29:47|They walked hand in hand into the Bear Clan, [Ji Di] led him to her home, [Leizu] looked around curiously, when suddenly a scent of rice and meat drifted out from the house. [Ji Di], who had been away for a long time, was puzzled, and [Mother Mo] heard the sound and ran out from the house.
0:29:50|0:29:57|[Ji Di] looked at [Leizu] and laughed, and then [Momu] noticed the woman next to [Ji Di].
0:30:1|0:30:7|[Ji Di] turned to look at [Leizu], their hands intertwined, while [Momu] showed a fierce expression.
0:30:33|0:30:47|Mo looked at Ji with disappointment in her eyes, unable to believe that Ji, who had grown up with her, would treat her like this. Tears kept rolling in her eyes as she turned and ran away. Leizu panicked and looked anxiously at Ji, taking a few steps forward.
0:30:54|0:31:18|[Leizu] was stunned for a second, and Ji Di sensed her concern and smiled at her. [Leizu]'s tense face finally showed a smile. At this moment, the heartbroken Mo ran crying to a big tree where no one was around. Thinking of Ji Di's heartlessness just now, she turned around in anger, tears streaming down her face. Suddenly, Ji Jiu sneaked up behind Mo with a net, caught her off guard, and carried her deep into the forest.
0:31:18|0:31:38|The dense fog envelops the entire forest. Apart from the weak cries of [Mo] and the sound of [Ji Jiu] walking, it is silent here. [Ji Jiu] takes [Mo] to a clearing, throws him to the ground, then tosses the axe from his waist aside. He squats down, removes the net from [Mo]'s body, and the hungry [Ji Jiu] passionately kisses [Mo]'s neck. Enraged, [Mo] uses all his strength to kick him.
0:31:38|0:31:49|Ji Jiu lost her balance and fell heavily to the ground, Mo quickly stood up and grabbed the small tree next to her. Because the tree trunk was too thin, the small tree shook violently, causing the snake on the tree to fall down and bite towards Ji Jiu's arm.
0:31:49|0:32:9|Ji Jiu looked at the bite wound on his right arm, screamed in fear, and Mo tied his left hand to a tree with a rope. Ji Jiu, lying on the ground, looked at him blankly, only to see him stepping on Ji Jiu's injured arm, staring at the snake tattoo intently. Finally, he bent down to pick up the stone axe on the ground. Ji Jiu seemed to understand something as he tightly closed his eyes.
0:32:9|0:32:26|Turning his head to the side, [Mo] began to tremble with fear as he slowly raised the stone axe. Taking aim at the bite mark on [Ji Jiu]'s arm, he ruthlessly chopped it off. [Ji Jiu] clenched his teeth tightly, trying not to make too much noise, as blood gushed out and instantly covered half of his face.
0:32:26|0:32:32|In the end, Mo left Ji Jiu alone and ran out of the woods. Still in shock, she quickly arrived at Ji Di's house, panting heavily.
0:32:41|0:32:55|Jidi turned and walked to the side of the pigsty. Mo, unwilling to give up, ran to Jidi's side. Jidi, indifferent, did not pay attention to Mo. Mo suddenly knelt on both knees, and Jidi turned to look at her upon hearing the sound.
0:32:56|0:33:21|Mo's expression was so determined, but Ji didn't take it seriously. He turned his head away and ignored Mo, continuing to feed the pig with a clay pot in his hand. Mo stared with wide eyes, tears swirling in his eyes, unable to believe Ji could be so indifferent. He seemed to have made up his mind, slowly stood up with tightly pursed lips, and ran off clenching his fists. Ji watched Mo run off, worried that Mo might do something foolish, hastily dropped the clay pot in his hand, and chased after him.
0:33:21|0:33:43|Suddenly, [Mo] ran into the mountains, swiftly weaving through the intricate forest. In the quiet woods, the echoes of Mo's crying filled the air. Worried [Ji Di] chased after her relentlessly. Running too fast, Mo soon ran out of breath and her steps slowed down. Seizing the opportunity, Ji Di swiftly caught Mo in his arms, and they both fell to the ground. Mo struggled to break free from Ji Di's grasp, trying to stand up as Ji Di grabbed his shoulders.
0:33:43|0:33:50|A turn and he pinned him down, panting heavily in the end, looking at the stubborn [Mo] beneath him, he seemed determined.
0:33:51|0:34:5|[Mo] looked at [Mo] in disbelief, a smile finally appeared on [Mo]'s face, tears of joy filled [Mo]'s eyes. Ji Di lifted [Mo] up on his shoulders and walked towards the tribe.
0:34:5|0:34:24|[Mo] bit Ji Di's arm hard to confirm that this was not a dream. The Bear Clan and the Shen Nong Clan were working the fields, each with their own responsibilities. The land was filled with vibrant crops, and the Bear Clan leader looked satisfied as he glanced at [Jiang Yan] beside him.
0:34:39|0:34:45|Inside were all kinds of ceramic jars, the cave uneven, [Mo] carefully walked to the jars.
0:34:45|0:35:5|A drop of water dripped from the top of the cave at this moment, falling right on [嫫]'s head. She covered her head and looked up, finding the place extremely damp. She quickly opened the stone pressed on top of the ceramic jar, revealing a murky liquid inside. Sitting beside the jar, she leaned over to smell a unique fragrance, then leaned closer to the jar mouth to sniff carefully. The scent became even stronger, a smell she had never encountered before.
0:35:5|0:35:22|She then carefully inserted a finger, dipped it in water, confirmed its edibility, put it in her mouth to taste the new flavor, feeling fresh and satisfied. She savored the taste carefully, then smiled with satisfaction. Looking around, she finally picked up a bowl-shaped object from her left hand side.
0:35:22|0:35:41|Scooping up a bowl of water from the ceramic jar, she looked at the water in the bowl, leaned in to smell the refreshing fragrance, and forgot everything. She couldn't wait to lift the bowl and drink it all in one go. Because she drank too quickly, half of the water spilled, but she didn't care at all about the sweet water she made. This made her unable to help but laugh happily, watching the water made in the ceramic jar turn out so successful.
0:35:41|0:35:47|She suddenly reached in and grabbed a handful of sticky rice, put it in her mouth, and then started gobbling it up voraciously.
0:35:47|0:36:8|He was eating the glutinous rice and drinking the rice wine made by herself, feeling satisfied and proud of his achievement. He couldn't wait to bring it back to let his people taste it. Later, he filled a small ceramic jar with the rice wine and brought it home. He poured a bowl for [Jidi] and [Leizu], and the two of them looked at it with some hesitation, as [Leizu] was unsure about what kind of water it was.
0:36:8|0:36:15|He saw [Jidi] taking big sips, so he took a sip of [Momu] as well, looking expectantly at [Jidi], hoping for her praise.
0:36:15|0:36:24|[Jidi] had a completely different expression after drinking the water. It was such a special water that he had never tasted before. He savored it carefully and then a smile slowly appeared on his face.
0:36:27|0:36:42|With a flushed face, [Mother Mo] looked at [Ji Di] and smiled contentedly. After drinking too much alcohol, she stood up unsteadily, burped, and took out a soil block wrapped in coarse linen. [Leizu] was puzzled.
0:36:44|0:36:55|[Mo Mu] knocked on the stone a few times, and after the soil fell off, he picked up two sharp animal bones and pried them open from the middle. After he cleaned off the soil, a whole piece of smoking fat meat was revealed, and the aroma instantly spread out.
0:36:55|0:37:3|Everyone looked at the fragrant and juicy meat in front of them, unconsciously smiling at the corners of their mouths, crazily swallowing saliva. [Mother Mo] sat down slowly and pointed at the meat.
0:37:6|0:37:13|[Jidi] closed his eyes and savored the aroma of the fat meat carefully, making [Momu] burst into laughter happily.
0:37:15|0:37:31|The strong aroma of the wine gradually got to [嫫母]'s head, her face flushed, her eyes unfocused, and suddenly she fell headfirst onto the table, leaving [嫘祖] looking bewildered. [姬地], full of food and drink, arrived at the riverbank, holding a small rock and rhythmically scratching it on a large boulder. [嫘祖] sat beside the boulder, watching the marks he made.
0:37:58|0:38:6|Jidi looked at the innocent [Leizu] and smiled, then nodded. The scene shifted to the mountains and forests, with Jidi supporting a half-cut dead tree on the ground with her left hand.
0:38:6|0:38:34|With a sharp stone in his right hand, he chisels the dry wood piece by piece. A hole is soon carved out of the dry wood, and he quickly arranges dry leaves next to it. Then, he takes out a pointed wooden stick and inserts it into the hole, using both hands to rapidly rotate it, allowing the stick to rub against the wood. Soon, smoke starts to emerge from the rubbing spot - he is trying to start a fire by friction. To make the fire burn brighter, he blows on it and then surrounds the hole with dry leaves. He continues to rapidly rotate the wooden stick, and the smoke grows thicker.
0:38:34|0:38:40|He put down the wooden stick, used his hands to protect the dry leaves, and blew gently a few times, and the fire instantly emerged through the leaves.
0:38:40|0:39:0|Jidi took a deep breath, then picked up two branches and placed them on the fire. In no time, the branches turned into two torches. He handed one to the little boy next to him. The boy walked slowly to the pile of trees and threw the torch in. Instantly, a large cloud of smoke rose from the forest, and the huge smoke quickly broke through the forest and reached the sky.
0:39:6|0:39:25|The Xiong family mistook the smoke for enemies deliberately setting fires, so they picked up weapons and ran towards the direction of the smoke. To boost morale, they shouted as they ran to see everyone coming. Ji Didi looked at the fire pretending to be mysterious.
0:39:26|0:39:43|The roaring fire burned fiercely as the tribe members stood quietly on the side, waiting for the surprise after the fire. As time passed, things hidden in the fire gradually revealed their true forms. In the middle of the tall and large solid object of earthy yellow color, there stood a dry tree branch firmly on the ground, now blackened by the fire.
0:39:54|0:40:6|Ji Di picked up a long branch from the ground and leaned it against the wall. The tribe members followed suit, picking up long branches and intertwining them on top. In no time, a simple roof took shape. Looking at the completed roof, Ji Di walked in front of the tribe members and made a formal introduction.
0:40:10|0:40:24|At this moment, a burly tribesman handed his weapon to the person next to him, then walked to the wall and kicked it hard with his foot. However, the wall didn't budge at all. The tribesman then stumbled back a few meters and fell to the ground. The crowd roared, but the tribal leader seemed lost in thought.
0:40:36|0:40:45|The tribe members all looked at Ji Di, who nodded firmly at the wall.
0:40:47|0:40:56|Time flies, [Emperor Yan], the tribe has been surrounded by walls, and the people live a brief and peaceful life.
0:41:4|0:41:9|[Leizu] smiled and lifted the grass on her shoulder, [Momu] looked at her and smiled, then the two of them walked into the house.
0:41:9|0:41:25|In the mouth of [Leizu], the millet and the Job's tears are the food source of [Yandi]. The vast millet fields stretch as far as the eye can see, each grain full of food. [Yandi] gathers around, one of them uses a sickle to cut down a bunch, rubs it with his hands to reveal edible millet, picks up one and puts it in his mouth to taste.
0:41:31|0:41:51|While everyone was celebrating, eerie laughter rang out again. The fierce tiger and pixiu all came out, and [Emperor Yan] suddenly panicked. He shouted and ran quickly towards the tribe, where bears, tigers, jackals, and wolves with sharp fangs were lurking, making terrifying sounds as they chased after him. The whistle blower stood on top of a tree, continuously blowing the whistle to summon more fierce beasts to attack [Emperor Yan].
0:41:53|0:42:15|[Yandi] tribesmen helped each other and finally ran into the tribe before the beasts caught up. They closed the big gate made of rough wood, and several people took out idle wood to insert horizontally on the gate. The tiger wanted to attack the tribesmen, but a fierce pounce failed to cross the gate. All the beasts were blocked outside the gate, stretching their claws through the crack towards the inside. [Yandi] exerted force against the door holding a stone axe to resist. At this time, the alarm sounded again, and all the beasts retreated. The unwilling tiger suddenly stopped and turned back.
0:42:15|0:42:37|Head looked at the sound of retreat, and had to leave, without the attack of the beast, [Yandi] still had fear on his face. It turned out that [Chiyou] walked over with a stone axe. [Yandi] observed his every move through the crack of the door. [Chiyou] sensed something was wrong, he looked left and right and saw that both sides of the wooden door were surrounded by walls made of yellow mud, with tree trunks connecting the walls, making it easy for people to enter. He observed all this with fresh eyes.
0:42:37|0:42:57|The people inside the gate were unaware of his intentions, hiding behind the gate in fear, watching as he slowly walked towards the left wall with a long-handled weapon. The wood above the wall seemed to be shouting, [Chi You] took a few steps towards the mud wall, then stopped. He looked at the wall with a sneer, holding the long-handled weapon in his hand. His face suddenly became fierce, and with a roar, he swung the weapon fiercely towards the wall.
0:42:57|0:43:1|The stone axe unexpectedly broke, with only a slight dent in one place, the rest of it was intact.
0:43:3|0:43:23|He threw away the broken weapon in his hand, lifted a stone weighing tens of kilograms with both hands, exerted all his strength to slowly raise the stone above his head, and then smashed it towards the wooden door. Although the support of the clan members did not pose a big obstacle to the wooden door, the people were frightened and took a few steps back in fear. Then, [Chiyou] picked up another huge rock and smashed it towards the wooden door again.
0:43:23|0:43:31|The wooden door couldn't withstand the force and was smashed open, looking at the damaged door, [Emperor Yan], who was blocking the door, could no longer hold back and retreated back to the tribe.
0:43:32|0:43:48|[Chiyou] pursued the enemy and picked up a huge rock to smash the wooden gate. The gate couldn't withstand the blow and collapsed instantly, but the tunnel wall remained intact. [Chiyou] looked at the wall in surprise, curious about who had built it. Stepping on the broken wooden gate, he strode into the Youxiong tribe.
0:43:48|0:44:13|The Jiuli tribe people also rushed over. Seeing the aggressive foreign tribesmen, the Xiong clan members were scared and hid behind the altar. [Chiyou] walked to the front of the altar, looked up at the animal skin hanging above, then forcefully tore it down. The Xiong clan members stared in surprise as [Chiyou] hung the animal skin around his neck. After tidying up, he noticed the cow head specimen hanging in the center of the door, reached out and touched it a few times, and couldn't help but sneer.
0:44:13|0:44:20|The leader of the Bear Clan looked serious and silently turned his head to one side. [Chiyou] glanced at the clan leader, then turned and pointed at the wall.
0:44:21|0:44:34|The leader of the Bear Clan looked up at the incredibly sturdy wall, despite the cracks. Upon hearing the leader's response, [Chi You] nodded in satisfaction and crouched down to continue questioning the leader.
0:44:52|0:45:0|[Chiyou] lowered his head in thought for a moment, then slowly stood up and looked around at the oppressed members of the Youxiong clan, before speaking to the clan leader.
0:45:43|0:45:50|He walked away with a smile, while the clan leader looked thoughtfully at who built this wall, [Chi You].
0:45:56|0:46:19|[Jidi] was hunting in the mountains, when suddenly a deer leaped through the forest. [Jidi] chased after it, bow and arrow in hand, ready to shoot at any moment. When the deer reached a clearing, [Jidi] saw his chance and quickly aimed the bow, releasing the arrow with great force. The deer was hit and fell to the ground. Just as [Jidi] was celebrating, a hawk's cry was heard from behind.
0:46:19|0:46:44|He flapped his huge wings and swooped down towards [Jidi], but in the nick of time, [Jidi] picked up a stone and threw it at the eagle. Unexpectedly, the eagle caught the stone with its claws and threw it to the ground. In front of the massive eagle, the strong [Jidi] appeared particularly petite. Startled, he sat down on the ground as the eagle seized a deer from the ground and flew into the air. [Jidi] suddenly stood up, grabbed his bow and arrow, and ran a few steps after the eagle. After taking aim, he used all his strength to release a shot.
0:46:44|0:47:6|The wounded eagle dropped the deer with an arrow and fled in panic, while the pregnant [Mother Mo] gave birth in a cave. The women of the Xiong clan held a special ceremony outside the cave, lining up in three rows, squatting on the ground with arms extended forward and backward, palms touching those of the people in front and behind. They then bowed down in a kneeling position, before standing up straight and looking up at the sky.
0:47:6|0:47:27|Repeatedly taking the lead, [Leizu] clearly showed signs of physical exhaustion. With a furrowed brow and pale lips, she began to see double as the sky suddenly started to rain. Despite the pain, she gritted her teeth and persevered for [Momu], who was kneeling on a stack of grass, clutching the wall tightly. As the ceremony neared its end, a cry rang out and the child was finally born.
0:47:27|0:47:53|Exhausted [Mother Mo] almost fainted, but when she saw the child, she smiled from the heart. She noticed the child enduring the pain of the umbilical cord, so she picked it up and used all her strength to bite it off with her teeth. At the same time, there was a joyous occasion in the forest, as the bear clan appeared. The men collectively ran into the forest, and [Chief Di] walked up to the prey and let out a roar, informing his companions of his successful hunt.
0:47:53|0:48:15|The tribespeople shouted [Jidi]'s name repeatedly, as [Jidi] lifted the fat roadkill high above his head. This successful hunt once again boosted his prestige. The weak [Momu] lay in a cave filled with dry grass, covered in animal skins. [Leizhu] slowly picked up the baby and looked at the tiny life in amazement and joy. Then he lifted the baby above his head with both hands, allowing the child to be baptized by the rain.
0:48:15|0:48:24|[Mo Mu] struggled to prop up her body, reaching out to see her child with her own eyes.
0:48:25|0:48:36|[Nüwa] nodded, and a sweet smile appeared on the pale face of [Momo]. [Jidi], who had just succeeded in hunting, was in a great mood. He squatted in front of a wild flower, couldn't help but pick one and smell the fragrance, which was refreshing.
0:48:36|0:48:58|The tribespeople next to them are processing deer meat. They have clear division of labor. One person is using a sharp stone to separate the skin and meat. He hands the peeled meat to a companion who is making fire nearby. The companion takes the meat and hangs it on a rack above the fire to roast. Another person is responsible for putting the meat into a pot of prepared sauce for marinating. At this moment, two tribal leaders are being supported by the tribespeople as they walk over. [Ji Di] immediately stands up upon seeing them. The elder of the Xiong clan, [Elder Ji Shan], lets out a sigh.
0:49:33|0:49:39|[Jidi] looked at the sharp spear without saying a word, and at this moment [Elder Jishan] walked up to [Jidi] with the scepter representing the Jixiong clan.
0:49:48|0:49:56|He handed the scepter to [Jidi], who frowned at the scepter. After a moment of contemplation, he took the scepter. Suddenly, a hurried voice came from not far away.
0:50:6|0:50:25|[Jidi] suddenly frowned nervously, looking serious. Everyone looked surprised as the scene shifted to a simple room made of earth by the Jiuli tribe. A fire was burning low, and pregnant [Leizu] sat on a bed covered with animal skins. She was motionless out of fear. Suddenly, a lecherous laughter could be heard from outside the door. The leader of the Jiuli tribe stood at the doorway, looking at [Leizu] with malicious intent, smiling.
0:50:25|0:50:37|He waved his big hand, and the guards at the door all left the clan leader and walked to the side of [Miao Zu]. He excitedly made a sound and shook his body, throwing down the feather inserted on his head. Startled, [Miao Zu] supported her stomach and stood up difficultly, running in the opposite direction, which
0:50:37|0:50:49|The clan leader became even more excited. He jumped up to the window and caught up with [Leizu] in an instant. He embraced [Leizu] from behind and threw him onto the bed. The clan leader laughed even more recklessly as he tried to spread [Leizu]'s legs apart with both hands. At this moment, the clan leader noticed his protruding abdomen.
0:50:49|0:51:5|He reached out and touched, then he opened the legs of [嫘祖], [嫘祖] struggled to pull out a hand and gave him a slap, then kicked him, the unsuspecting tribal leader immediately fell to the ground, [嫘祖] tried to crawl away, the tribal leader grabbed her, picked up a stone and was about to hit her, when a hand suddenly appeared and grabbed him.
0:51:11|0:51:27|[Chiyou] snatched the stone from the clan leader's hand, his angry face trembling slightly. The frightened [Leizu] supported her pregnant belly and stood up, staggering towards the door. The clan leader wanted to chase after him, but his hand was firmly held by [Chiyou], who smirked disdainfully.
0:51:31|0:51:50|The scene shifts to outdoors, where the Jiuli tribe is conducting a special ceremony. From a distance, Ji Di takes aim and shoots an arrow, hitting a person dancing on the platform. The Jiuli tribe is startled and immediately turns to look in the direction of the archer. Ji Di, standing on the roof, shoots a second arrow, which firmly lands on the sacrificial platform behind the tribe. Ji Di then jumps down from the roof and stands opposite [Chi You].
0:51:50|0:52:17|[Chiyou] took a glance, then turned around. The sword stuck in the head of the dead tribesman was inserted too deeply, causing his hand to involuntarily tremble. He carefully observed the sword he pulled out in front of his eyes. Ji Di's swordsmanship was superb, so [Chiyou] had to release the wild beasts. Instantly, a noisy clamor erupted as fierce roars were heard. Tigers and black leopards emerged, baring their fangs and raising their tails, their fierce gazes fixed on Ji Di as they pounced. Ji Di ran forward with all his might, occasionally looking back at the wild beasts. Despite their ferocity, Ji Di showed no fear.
0:52:17|0:52:36|With a swift kick, [Ji Di] hooked the thick vine hanging nearby and threw it into the air as the wild beasts closed in. Suddenly, he leaped up, grabbing the vine and spinning in mid-air. The fierce beasts, unable to keep up with the speed, all rushed off the cliff, letting out pitiful roars. After spinning around once while holding onto the vine, [Ji Di] swung on it, then planted his right foot on the edge of the cliff and pressed against the cliff wall, hiding.
0:52:36|0:53:0|Before long, all the fierce beasts fell off the cliff, the plan succeeded. Ji Di looked down at the bottom of the cliff with a smile. As night fell, the tall grass swayed in the wind, making a rustling sound. [Leizu] stood in the middle of the grass, looking around. At this moment, Ji Di ran over from a distance. [Leizu] quickly turned around to see his beloved running towards him, feeling a sudden sense of security. Ji Di ran up to [Leizu] and stopped in front of him, his eyes full of tenderness.
0:53:0|0:53:21|He held [Leizu] tightly in his arms, and the seemingly strong [Leizu] finally couldn't hold back anymore, tears filled her eyes in an instant. After the excitement, Jidi gradually calmed down. He suddenly furrowed his brows, not understanding why [Chiyou] spared him. He looked at [Leizu] as if searching for an answer. [Leizu] looked at Jidi, who was full of doubt, and instantly understood his meaning.
0:53:21|0:53:34|Jidi turned his head and sighed softly. The words "surrender" would never be realized by him. He took a few steps towards where [Chiyou] was, his eyes filled with determination. Then he said decisively,
0:53:36|0:53:55|As the day breaks, the imminent battle between the Xiong clan and the Jiuli tribe is about to begin. The two tribes stand on opposite sides, with Ji Di and [Chi You] at the front line. The Jiuli tribe members are dressed in animal skins, wearing animal bones on their heads and holding sharp weapons as they march forward aggressively. Before the battle starts, both sides start performing war dances. The Xiong clan members raise their weapons above their heads.
0:53:55|0:54:16|With firm and rhythmic steps, hands holding sharp weapons swaying back and forth, sometimes swinging forward and backward, sometimes crossing and rotating, as if facing an invisible enemy. Each movement seems to strike at the enemy's vital points. The weapons make a rustling sound as they move, as if taunting the enemy. The Jiuli tribe on the opposite side is equally strong, with their unique and domineering fighting style.
0:54:16|0:54:36|It's as if they are engaged in a special competition with the Youshi clan, with their weapons becoming the highlight. They swing from side to side, making stabbing gestures, and at times attack from the front and back, extending their weapons. The invisible beast bones on their faces add a sense of fear. Although we cannot see the faces of the tribespeople, their raised critical strikes and firm steps indicate a significant increase in their momentum.
0:54:36|0:54:41|At this moment, [Chi You] raised his weapon and let out a powerful roar, the echo reverberating around.
0:54:43|0:54:48|They are not only showcasing the most magnificent and graceful dance skills, but also the most powerful dance moves.
0:54:48|0:55:13|The war dance has aroused the fighting desire of two tribes. Everyone's eyes are so determined. [Leizu] is holding a weapon, breathing heavily, with a murderous look in his eyes. At this moment, a tribesman behind him walks forward and takes the long spear from his hand used for the war dance. Another tribesman quickly runs over and hands two short-handled stone drums to [Leizu]. He looks at the fierce [Chiyou] slowly reaching out his hand to take the stone axe and raises it in front of him, ready to compete with [Chiyou].
0:55:13|0:55:28|[Chiyou] also showed no weakness, he raised high the long-handled stone axe in his hand and let out a roar, the tribesmen behind him also raised their weapons together. [Leizu] walked towards [Chiyou] with a determined look in her eyes, the accompanying tribesmen placed their weapons in front of their chests, ready for battle at any moment.
0:55:28|0:55:42|At this moment, the Jiuli tribe quickly adjusted their posture, gripped their weapons, and followed [Chi You] at a steady pace, ready to fight at any moment. Suddenly, the two tribes started running, shouting and raising their weapons, on the brink of a battle.
0:55:43|0:55:55|The Jiuli tribe launched the first attack, running while pulling out round stones from their waists to throw at the Youxiong clan. Caught off guard, they were at a loss for a moment, like ants on a hot pan, unable to come up with a solution, and could only dodge flexibly.
0:55:55|0:56:16|The power of the original stone is immense. The tribe members who were hit fell to the ground instantly. The Jiuli tribe became even more audacious in throwing the original stones. In an instant, some fell to the ground. Seeing the Jiuli tribe gaining the upper hand, [Leizu] merged the weapons in her hands into one, and with her remarkable strength, she threw a sharp beast bone from her waist towards the Jiuli tribe. Before [Chiyou] could react, it hit the horn on his forehead.
0:56:16|0:56:28|The headdress on top of his head instantly fell off, [Chiyou] was completely enraged, he shouted and raised his weapon to strike at Jidi, who did not back down, her face full of anger, and the two tribes instantly engaged in a fierce battle.
0:56:28|0:56:43|The spear of the Jiuli tribe is extremely sharp, causing the enemy to bleed instantly when stabbed. As the first wave of attack subsides, the Jiuli tribe from behind rushes in like a hurricane. The Xiong tribe is equally formidable, their stone axes powerful enough to kill the enemy on the spot with a single blow.
0:56:43|0:56:56|The tribesmen rushed forward one by one, waving their stone drums and fighting bravely. The two sides were evenly matched, and they did not back down for the honor of the tribe. The clean lawn was instantly dyed red with blood, and the weaker women became the biggest casualties of the war.
0:56:56|0:57:8|The woman with her ponytail weapon knocked off sat on the ground retreating, while the man in the mask showed no mercy and continued to press on. He suddenly raised a stone axe and shouted as he smashed it towards the woman, who raised her arms in a feeble attempt to defend herself in fear.
0:57:8|0:57:24|Just as the attack was about to hit, Ji Di suddenly appeared, raising the stone axe in his right hand to knock away the masked man's weapon. At the same time, he extended the stone axe in his left hand to stab towards his neck. Ji Di didn't have time to help up the ponytail girl, immediately rushing to assist the fellow tribesmen nearby. Seeing this, the Jiuli tribe members around him said to the whistle-blower beside them,
0:57:26|0:57:43|The whistleblower woman clenched her teeth and let out an animal-like roar, opening her body like a fierce tiger, with all four limbs on the ground, pouncing towards You Xiong, then reaching out her hand to viciously dig into the enemy's neck. Her nails were exceptionally sharp, leaving three marks on the man's neck in an instant, followed by a gush of blood. The elder of the You Xiong clan watched this scene from a distance.
0:57:43|0:58:4|The furrowed brow, the Jiuli tribe's eyes turned red, watching the Xiong clan about to be defeated. At this moment, three people from the Xiong clan brought out a heavy weapon - two sharp ivory tusks tied together with a rope. Due to their large size, the enemy was caught off guard and could only wait for death. The Xiong clan aimed at the target, piercing the enemy's chest in one shot, the ivory instantly stained with the gushing blood.
0:58:26|0:58:38|Ji Di's face splattered with blood, his veins bulging, he cut a path towards [Chi You]. [Chi You] raised his stone axe to strike, but Ji Di swiftly sidestepped, bent down, and slid behind [Chi You], seizing a weapon and aiming for his back.
0:58:38|0:58:59|[Chiyou] quickly regained consciousness and dodged the attack aimed at his chest. Ji Di weakly collapsed on the ground. [Chiyou] took advantage of the situation and raised his stone axe to strike at Ji Di. Just in time, Ji Di managed to dodge the attack by turning around. As [Chiyou] was about to launch a second attack, Ji Di quickly picked up a weapon and stood up to confront him. Due to [Chiyou]'s overwhelming strength, Ji Di could only evade the attacks.
0:58:59|0:59:13|Seeing that her strength was almost depleted, Jidi picked up the stone axe to fight back, but was instantly knocked down. The Jiuli tribe cheered excitedly, [Chiyou] prepared to eradicate the threat, with an elder from the Xiong clan expressing concern.
0:59:14|0:59:34|Jidi did not fight to the death. Instead, he was seen running towards an open space with a weapon in hand, with [Chiyou] closely chasing from behind. In an instant, the two ran out of the melee area. Some members of the Xiong clan were observing everything from the grass not far away. It turned out that they had already set up a trap. Unaware, [Chiyou] was still chasing at full speed. Jidi easily jumped over the trap and lured [Chiyou] to follow him to the ambush point, where the people lying in wait shouted out.
0:59:43|1:0:5|At this moment, Ji Di and another tribe member ran from two directions holding weapons, continuously attacking [Chi You] who could only withstand the attacks. Suddenly, a whistle blower leaped like a fierce tiger, using sharp nails to dig into the enemies. Finally, he jumped on [Chi You] trying to tear off the ropes on his body. Xiong Shi, who was pulling the ropes, picked up a nearby tree branch and smashed it towards the whistle blower, causing her intense pain and screams.
1:0:5|1:0:17|But she still didn't back down, biting hard at the back of the rope net. After biting it off, she even jumped to the front of [Chi You] to continue biting the rope net. The rope man picked up a large stone and threw it at her repeatedly, seeing that she still didn't stop biting the rope net.
1:0:17|1:0:43|The rope man dropped the rope in his hand, picked up a weapon and ran over to knock him down. By this time, the rope net had been bitten off to break free from the net. He looked at the whistle blower who was seriously injured, suddenly clenched his teeth and grabbed the weapon in the rope man's hand, trying to break it. At this moment, several people of the Xiong clan lifted a thick tree trunk together and rushed towards [Chiyou]. [Chiyou] suddenly broke the weapon in his hand into two pieces with his bare hands, half of it inserted into the abdomen of the rope man, and then raised the half of the stone axe in his hand to defend.
1:0:43|1:1:5|Facing the overwhelming pressure from both sides, he gritted his teeth and persisted. His veins bulged as he exerted brute force to split open part of the tree trunk. Seeing this, the tree hugger immediately advanced, attempting to bring down [Chiyou]. [Chiyou], with all his might, managed to split the entire trunk, leaving Ji Di dumbfounded. Ji Di quickly gave the order to retreat with the people of the Bear Clan.
1:1:7|1:1:19|The enraged [Chiyou] would not easily let them go. After confirming the direction in which the Xiong clan fled, he picked up the blood-stained stone axe on the ground and shouted. At this moment, the Jiuli tribe people rushed over to engage in a life-and-death battle with the Xiong clan.
1:1:19|1:1:32|Who would have thought they were well prepared, as they ran into the woods and quickly set up a large net to form a wall. The Jiuli tribe couldn't break through the highly resilient net, so they could only watch as they escaped. [Chiyou] picked up a stone axe and tried to attack the king, but it was in vain.
1:1:32|1:1:41|The escaped tribespeople, in order to avoid being hunted down by the Jiuli tribe, divided their work clearly and raced against time to build a raft to cross the river. Only by crossing the river can they be temporarily safe.
1:1:41|1:2:1|Only to see the two of them carrying a frame to transport the inflatable skin bags, while the others were making rafts. [Leizu] stood up the finished raft, then tightly tied the skin bag to the raft. After tying the skin bag securely, in order to make it stronger, he pulled the rope hard. Just as he was about to tie the second skin bag, a tribesman ran anxiously from a distance to [Leizu] and said,
1:2:22|1:2:28|[Nüwa] paused for a moment, then immediately turned and ran towards the river, followed closely by her tribespeople.
1:2:37|1:2:51|Not far away in the mountains and forests, the Jiuli tribe quietly chased after them. At this moment, in order not to burden the tribe, the two supported the elderly Jiang Yan and walked towards the middle of the river. Many elderly tribe members leaned on crutches and followed Jiang Yan. [Ji Di] ran to the riverbank and watched this scene.
1:2:53|1:3:6|The tribe members who were about to die seemed to continue walking towards the river as if they hadn't heard anything. [Ji Di] anxiously jumped into the river and grabbed Jiang Yan.
1:3:9|1:3:17|[Chi You]'s arrival made the Youshiji who were making wooden rafts restless in an instant. They picked up the wooden rafts they were making and hurriedly fled. Groups of Jiuli people holding weapons ran over, shouting.
1:3:21|1:3:29|The Jiuli tribe launched an attack, their momentum fierce as they began looting. Those who didn't have time to escape were hacked to death by the enemy. Hiding behind a haystack, [Ji Jiu] took advantage of the enemy's distraction.
1:3:42|1:3:58|All jumped into the river, luckily protected by their skin bags. They quickly headed towards the other side of the river. Sitting on the wooden raft, [Ji Jiu] shouted to speed up the raft. The pursuing Jiuli tribe couldn't enter the river, so they stood in the middle of the river and started throwing weapons. The people who thought they could escape were still hit by the weapons and instantly submerged by the river.
1:3:58|1:4:13|Watching the scattered Xiong clan members in the river, [Chi You] suddenly became interested. He picked up a huge rock from the ground and threw it into the river with all his strength. A wooden raft was hit, revealing a large hole in the middle, causing splashes of water to rise instantly. All the people on the raft fell into the river.
1:4:13|1:4:34|At this moment, the Jiuli tribe people handed another stone to [Chiyou], who raised it above his head and fiercely threw it out. Another wooden raft was hit, causing panic among the Youshi clan. The Jiuli tribe let out victorious roars, stopped the attack, and the surviving tribe members grabbed the inflated animal skins, swiftly swimming towards the other side of the river. On the opposite bank stood [Momo], holding a child in her arms.
1:4:34|1:4:52|Ji Jiu squatted on the side watching the river on the opposite bank. At this moment, Ji Di and Jiang Yan Emperor led the rest of the clan towards them. Ji Di walked up to Mother Mo and touched her shoulder before continuing to walk towards the riverbank. The turbulent river calmed down at this moment, and Jiang Yan Emperor looked at the destroyed homeland on the opposite side of the river.
1:5:10|1:5:35|Jiang [Yandi] looked at the crying baby in the arms of [Momu], reached out and gently touched his head. Then [Momu] handed the child to [Jidi], who reached out and slowly took the child in his arms. He took a few steps forward with the child in his arms, looking at the destroyed homeland on the other side of the river. His eyes suddenly became determined, then he lifted the child high. The crying baby kept squirming, the sunlight shining on the baby. All the clan members looked at the baby as if they saw the endless descendants.
1:5:35|1:5:57|He symbolizes the common hope of the Youxiong clan and the Shennong clan. As night falls and the turbulent river becomes unusually calm, a raft with an inflatable skin bag tied to it slowly drifts towards the opposite bank of the river. A head peeks out from behind the raft, it turns out to be [Jidi]. He cautiously looks around, making sure there is no danger nearby, then he picks up the stone axe on the skin bag.
1:5:57|1:6:3|Then he pushed the raft ashore and returned to the place where the Xiong family used to live on the other side of the river.
1:6:3|1:6:22|The baptism of war has left this place in ruins, with broken houses and bloodied bodies lying everywhere among wooden sticks and skins. In their final moments of life, they still hold their weapons tightly, with scattered skins for crossing the river nearby. The fierce enemies have shattered their last hope for survival.
1:6:22|1:6:50|[Jidi] walked among them, watching as the once valiant tribespeople became helpless, the altar where sacrifices were made now in ruins. [Jidi] stared at the altar, tears welling up in his eyes. Disobeying his own will, he dropped his weapon and knelt before the altar with a thud. Though the altar was no longer intact, his faith remained unwavering. He slowly placed his hands on his chest, then extended them devoutly towards the altar, performing a solemn bow. He prayed that his upcoming plan would be a great success.
1:6:50|1:7:8|In the early morning, the vines in the forest intertwined like layers of a large net, echoing the calls of birds in the cold mountain forest. [Ji Di] was seen holding a weapon in his left hand, while his right hand was placed near his mouth, imitating bird calls. He walked through the dense jungle and grass, observing his surroundings as he moved forward.
1:7:8|1:7:22|This is a unique recognition code of the Bear Clan. At this moment, not far behind a tree, the Bear Clan elder heard the sound. Leading a group of clan members, they cautiously peeked out their heads, then carefully walked towards the direction of the bird call. The other clan members hiding in another place also slowly emerged upon hearing the call.
1:7:22|1:7:40|After carefully observing and confirming that they were their own people, he spoke to the people next to him. At this moment, the Ji Di suddenly leaped down from the collapsed roof while the Ji Li people were still asleep. The leader of the Ji Li people woke up instantly as Ji Di landed in front of him, and he grabbed the leader's neck.
1:7:44|1:8:1|The tribal leader was speechless, he shook his head to command the tribe, at this moment a female tribesman picked up a sharp animal bone and stabbed it into [Jidi]'s back. [Jidi] was in pain and punched the attacker. The tribal leader covered [Jidi]'s head with a fur, but as soon as he uncovered it, a woman rushed over and grabbed his neck, knocking him down on the bed. The other tribesmen came forward and punched and kicked him, while the tribal leader cheered on the side.
1:8:1|1:8:19|When the tribesmen were about to attack with weapons, [Jidi] quickly grabbed her hand and threw her one meter away. Then she picked up a ceramic jar next to her and smashed it on the person who was choking him. After kicking her away, the tribal leader was shocked. Seeing no one coming to help, he prepared to escape, but [Jidi] picked up a weapon next to her and threw it at him, and he agilely dodged it.
1:8:19|1:8:38|[Jidi] was about to chase out, when a fat woman suddenly threw herself at him. [Jidi] spun around but couldn't shake her off. As the leader of the house ran out, he saw a large group of Yuxiong clan members approaching with weapons. He stood there in confusion, unable to move. At that moment, [Chiyou] arrived and knocked down the beam at the door, hitting the Yuxiong clan members. Startled by the noise, [Jidi] suddenly threw himself backwards.
1:8:38|1:8:47|The fat woman fell heavily on the bed, ran to the door, saw [Chi You] stunned for a few seconds, with a hint of fear on her face, and the clan leader instantly became arrogant.
1:8:51|1:8:59|The Xiong clan retreated in an instant, [Ji Di] glanced at [Chi You] who then fled as well. The infuriated tribal leader looked at [Chi You] and took all the tribe members away.
1:9:4|1:9:22|The words were not finished when suddenly a thunder appeared in the sky, followed by a torrential rain with lightning and thunder. The heavy rain washed over every tribe, but the wars between the tribes did not stop. The people of the Jiuli tribe were seen struggling to cross the swift stream with their weapons, wrapped in animal skins without any defense, letting the rain beat against their bodies.
1:9:22|1:9:37|Not long after, they arrived at the Youxiong tribe, where the bodies had already been cleaned up. Four Youxiong tribesmen emerged from behind the wall with bows and arrows, lining up at the door, aiming at the invading enemies. [Chiyou] looked at the situation in front of him and couldn't help but take a step back.
1:9:39|1:9:54|[Chi You] did not choose to escape, but picked up his weapon and prepared to fight. [Ji Di] calmly said to the tribe, then turned and disappeared into the wall. The tribe also put away their bows and arrows and ran away. [Chi You] knew he had been tricked but still gave the command.
1:9:56|1:10:17|The Jiuli tribe rushed into the Youxiong tribe with great momentum, but unexpectedly the entrance was covered with a pile of grass that suddenly opened to the sides, turning into a huge trap. [Chiyou] fell into it unprepared. The tribe quickly stopped and shouted loudly, but before they could act, [Jidi] ran over with her people, pulled out her bow and arrow, and shot at the invading enemies.
1:10:26|1:10:43|[Jidi] slowly put down the bow in his hand and walked towards the trap that had been set up in advance. He saw [Chiyou] with a ferocious face, roaring loudly. [Jidi] mercilessly covered it with a wooden lid, and after the storm passed, the Xiong clan returned to calmness.
1:10:43|1:10:58|[Mo Mu] led her people to the trap, with two of them holding weapons on the side. One of them lifted the lid, revealing [Chi You] with dried mud all over his face. He looked up warily as [Mo Mu] slowly lowered the basket tied with a rope.
1:10:58|1:11:12|Inside was a portion of wild fruits and water, [Chi You] was already starving. He checked the items and held the ceramic jar for water in his hand, looking at the things inside. Then he drank the sweet water in big gulps, feeling amazed. He savored it carefully.
1:11:26|1:11:30|[Queen Mother] withdrew her gaze from [Chi You] and looked into the distance.
1:11:35|1:11:43|[Chi You] sneered, it was impossible for him. At this moment, [Ji Di] squatted quietly beside the valley pile, with a vacant look, and the pregnant [Leizu] noticed that he was preoccupied.
1:11:43|1:11:56|Slowly squatting beside him, [Nuwa] placed her hand on his arm. Hearing the sound, he finally came to his senses, looked up at [Nuwa], then lowered his head and slowly stood up, still staring blankly into the distance.
1:11:57|1:12:15|The unusual bird calls at this moment caught the attention of [Jidi]. He turned to look at the river in the mountains, only to see flocks of birds circling in the air. The waterfowl on the water flapped their wings noisily, and [Jidi] took a few steps forward, finally revealing a smile on his face.
1:12:42|1:13:1|[Leizu] suddenly felt it wasn't him who was about to give birth while clutching his stomach. Seeing this, the clan members quickly supported him. At this moment, the Jiuli tribe also noticed something unusual. They watched as the birds in front of them behaved unusually. The Jiuli tribe instantly panicked. Just as they were about to flee, a flood like wild beasts from the mountains rushed out. Ji Di held a rope and said to the enemy,
1:13:2|1:13:11|[Mo Mu] threw one end of the rope to [Chi You] as [Ji Di] caught up, but he remained indifferent.
1:13:12|1:13:21|[Chi You] weakly closed his eyes as Ji Di shouted again, the raging lake water mixed with broken branches and rocks rushing down from the valley.
1:13:22|1:13:35|Afterwards, he leaped down into the trap, looped the rope around [Chiyou]'s waist, and as the flood rushed into the already turbulent river, Ji Di patted [Chiyou]'s face after securing the rope. He was almost unconscious. Ji Di then said to [Momo],
1:13:36|1:13:55|Mo exerted all her strength to pull the rope, while the unconscious [Chiyou] remained motionless. [Jidi] struggled to climb up the edge of the trap, and quickly grabbed the rope. Just then, the roaring flood grew closer and closer. Worried, [Jidi] looked up and saw the flood, like a fierce beast, destroying a village not far away. In a critical moment, the two of them exerted all their strength to pull the rope backwards.
1:13:55|1:14:21|Just as the flood was about to reach the Youxiong tribe, the two finally pulled out [Chiyou], and then they supported [Chiyou] and quickly ran towards the tribe. The flood behind them was about to catch up. Suddenly, [Jidi] mentioned that the flood was roaring towards them. The tremendous force caused the nearby rocks to continuously slide down. [Jidi] pushed away the rolling rocks hitting [Mo]'s arm heavily. The flood, like a giant beast, instantly swallowed the entire army in one fell swoop.
1:14:21|1:14:26|The wooden door with the totem was ruthlessly destroyed, accompanied by a deafening roar echoing through the sky.
1:14:26|1:14:46|Soon after, the flood finally receded and the sky cleared. After being washed by the flood, the old and sturdy big tree still stood tall, with many branches slowly sprouting. [Ji Di], who was in a coma, furrowed his brow. Due to the pain in his shoulder, he couldn't help but tremble. Beside him, [Mo] carefully helped him tidy up the dry leaves on his hair. [Ji Di] slowly opened his eyes.
1:14:46|1:14:54|[Mo] finally smiled, reaching out to touch [Jidi]'s face. [Jidi] looked down at his injured arm, and at that moment [Mo] gently grabbed his injured arm and said
1:14:59|1:15:15|[Jidi], who was not fully conscious yet, watched [Mo] carefully savoring her words just now. Finally, a smile appeared on her face. [Mo] carefully helped him tidy up his messy hair. This was undoubtedly great news for him. Having just narrowly escaped death, he received the blessing from the heavens.
1:15:16|1:15:30|The heartfelt words made [Mo] feel very comforted, while [Jidi] suddenly looked nervous with a smile on his face. It seems like he remembered something?
1:15:32|1:15:54|At this moment, he felt a mixture of emotions in his heart, a kind of indescribable sadness. After a fierce mountain flood, the Xiong tribe became desolate, with deep cracks appearing on the sturdy walls and traces of flood remaining on the muddy ground. [Jiang Yan] walked over, slowly bent down to pick up the rice covered in mud on the ground, holding it in his hand and looking at it repeatedly with a heart full of pain.
1:15:54|1:16:1|The white-haired [Jiang Yan] spent his whole life and efforts on cultivating grains, but now he is on the brink of death due to the ravaging mountain flood.
1:16:1|1:16:14|All the tribe members stood in line on both sides, watching as Daogu's face was filled with seriousness. He looked up at [Jidi], then took heavy steps towards him. He tried to control his emotions and then said to him,
1:16:24|1:16:50|The disaster has caused him to lose too much. [Jidi] let out a deep sigh. At this moment, [Chiyou] holding a weapon and carrying the leader of the Jiuli tribe on his shoulder, slowly walked towards [Jidi]. The current [Chiyou] no longer sees [Jidi] as an enemy, and there is no longer a murderous look in his eyes. When he reached [Jidi], he threw the leader of the tribe on the ground, causing the leader to cry out in pain a few times, then look around in fear. Finally, [Chiyou] stepped over the leader and walked in front of [Jidi], remaining silent for a while.
1:16:55|1:17:8|[Chiyou] is convinced by [Jidi], he raises his weapon with both hands and hands it to [Jidi]. The tribe members all look towards [Jidi], seemingly waiting for him to make a decision. [Jidi] looks at the former enemy surrendering, and can't help but take a deep breath.
1:17:8|1:17:26|He then took the weapon with both hands, looking uneasily at the clenched fist and excited expression of [Elder Ji Shan], which finally made his eyes firm. The constant sacrifices and persistence of the tribe have brought about the current stability and peace. The surrendering [Chi You] decided to leave this place. He believed in [Ji Di], but did not completely submit to him.
1:17:26|1:17:34|On the day of departure, [Jidi] bid farewell to [Chiyou]. They walked side by side along the riverbank, with [Chiyou] carrying nothing but his wife and weapons.
1:17:34|1:18:0|[Jidi] stopped after walking a distance and watched [Chiyou] leave. At this moment, the river was calm like a painting, and the surrounding grass was very quiet, as if bidding farewell to [Chiyou]. [Chiyou] took a few steps, suddenly stopped, then slowly placed the pear that [Jidi] gave him on the ground and turned to look at [Jidi]. He admired [Jidi]'s bravery and intelligence, and such a powerful opponent made him reluctant to leave. Looking at [Chiyou] stopping, [Jidi] thought that [Chiyou] had changed his mind.
1:18:20|1:18:38|[Jidi] immediately turned around and saw [Momu] and [Leizu] each carrying their children and holding something running towards them. [Leizu] held up a piece of cloth in her hand. [Jidi] glanced at it but didn't reach out to take it. Seeing this, [Momu] touched the linen bundle on her shoulder and then walked towards [Chiyou].
1:18:38|1:18:42|He took off the linen bag and handed it to [Chi You].
1:18:45|1:18:53|[Chi You] had a look of surprise on his face as he took the salt water, lean meat, and holy water handed to him, passing them to his wife beside him. His wife pursed her lips, then carried them behind her back.
1:18:53|1:19:13|[Nuwa] watched as he accepted the gift and turned to leave. At this moment, [Fuxi] walked towards them holding a piece of cloth in his hand. He glanced at [Chiyou] and his wife, then raised the cloth and handed it to [Chiyou]. On the cloth was a comb made of fish bones. [Chiyou] picked up the comb, took a look at it, and then inserted it into his own hair. [Fuxi] smiled with relief, then turned and walked away.
1:19:13|1:19:23|[Chiyou] slowly unfolds the cloth in his hand, which is a scarf. He hangs it around his neck and finally smiles as he looks at the generous [Jidi], [Momu], and [Leizu] in front of him.
1:19:23|1:19:38|After organizing these items, he picked up the raccoon on the ground, turned around and walked straight ahead. [Leizu] watched his departing figure with worry, wanting to stop him, but he knew that [Chiyou] had bigger goals. He took a step forward and shouted.
1:19:49|1:19:55|After saying that, [Nuwa] and [Leizu] watched proudly as [Jidi] defeated [Chiyou], becoming the tribe's belief.
1:19:55|1:20:17|[Chi You]'s wife blew the whistle again, and two remaining wild beasts rushed out of the bushes. They glanced back at [Ji Di] as if bidding him farewell, then slowly turned around and followed their master. A relieved smile finally appeared on [Ji Di]'s tense face as he watched the backs of the two humans and two beasts gradually moving away. [Chi You] finally let go of his hatred and abandoned his ambition for plunder.
1:20:18|1:20:35|In the midst of his joy, he also worried that [Chiyou] had no relatives or friends to help him. Only with his wife by his side, could [Chiyou] overcome the challenges ahead? It was impossible to know. With [Chiyou] leaving, [Jidi] led the people of the hundred tribes through a peaceful 20 years, where they farmed, wove cloth, and made pottery.
1:20:36|1:21:5|The people of the tribe stood on both sides of the paddy field, [Ji Di] holding a shovel digging the moist soil on the ground. He pushed the soil in the middle to the sides, and the water from upstream flowed down through the gaps. The gaps became larger and the water flowed faster. Watching the continuous flow of water, [Chi You] excitedly shouted. Some even played in the water puddle like children. The women squatted down with ceramic jars to collect water. Afterwards, everyone used their farming tools to manipulate the water in the direction of the flow. At the end of the water flow was a small pond.
1:21:5|1:21:27|Surrounded by endless fields, a small stream solves the problem of water supply for the fields. Scattered around are the [Chiyou] people, all dancing with excitement. The long-awaited day has finally arrived. At this moment, a tribesman rushes from the riverbank, weaving through the crowd to reach the leader of the tribe.
1:21:30|1:21:54|[Jidi] looked towards the riverbank, where a raft slowly docked. A man with a long fur cap on his head, carrying a bow and arrows, and dressed in animal skins, led a wild ox down from the raft. Following him was a woman dressed similarly. The tribe members all approached with farming tools in a defensive stance. The two individuals walked up to [Jidi], knelt down without saying a word. [Jidi] hesitated for a moment, then did not reach out to help them up.
1:22:2|1:22:8|Bo and Wu stood up and looked at the descendants of [Chi You] who had grown up.
1:22:30|1:22:47|Wu lowered her head after finishing speaking, raised the divine crown above her head, bent her legs, and carefully presented the divine crown to Ji Di with the highest courtesy. Ji Di reached out and took the divine crown, carefully examining the exquisite patterns on it. This was Chi You's blessing and expectation for him, and he felt a lump in his throat.
1:22:48|1:22:56|Bo turned his head and pulled the buffalo behind him.
1:23:8|1:23:25|Bo led the wild ox forward, bent down and raised the rope in his hands to hand it to [Jidi]. [Jidi] handed the divine crown in his hands to the person next to him, freeing up his hand to grab the rope. He tightened the rope and then took a few steps forward, reaching out to stroke the head of the wild ox. The wild ox remained still, and his heart was filled with respect for [Chiyou].
1:23:25|1:23:46|On the other side, [Mother of Mò] stood beside a large tree. The old and sturdy trunk was covered with cracks and many scratches. She reached out her hand and kept touching these scratches, lost in thought. Suddenly, a hand reached out in front of her, startling her. She then realized it was [Lèizu] who handed her a wild fruit. [Mother of Mò] smiled at [Lèizu].
