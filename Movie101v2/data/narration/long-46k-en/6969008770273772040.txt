0:2:21|0:2:33|Mr. Qian also shouted, then used a calculator, and then wrote it down in a notebook, saying to [Li Guofu],
0:2:52|0:3:4|[Li Guofu] continued to ask, and Mr. Qian said helplessly,
0:3:21|0:3:30|After speaking, Li Guofu looked somewhat pleased as he glanced at the suona in his hand, and Mr. Qian continued,
0:3:41|0:3:47|Mr. Qian raised his hand to hit [Li Guofu] while counting money, but accidentally tripped and scattered money all over the floor.
0:4:20|0:4:29|At this moment, [Li Guofu] suddenly remembered that his son was outside and about to leave. Mr. Qian saw the police surrounding [Li Guofu] and tried to slip away, but he was still caught by the police.
0:4:43|0:4:54|At the same time, Li Guofu, who had just climbed over the outer wall, was also caught. Pinned to the ground, Li Guofu looked towards Ping Wa not far away. Ping Wa was being firmly held down by three policemen, screaming in pain.
0:4:55|0:5:27|The four people who were then controlled were handcuffed to the iron bars of the detention vehicle. [Li Guofu] stared at Boss Qian, then looked at his son and asked. Li Faqun shook his head, and after [Li Guofu] nodded, he kicked Boss Qian, who hit back. Boss Qian felt guilty and remained silent. [Li Guofu] angrily asked, and Boss Qian, with a helpless and annoyed expression, replied,
0:5:29|0:5:44|After lecturing Mr. Qian, [Li Guofu] shouted towards the police in front. Seeing no response from the police, he turned around to comfort his son, Li Faqun.
0:6:3|0:6:26|After letting out a sigh, [Li Guofu] felt uncomfortable in the back of his neck. He reached out and touched it, pulling out the broken sunglasses from the collar of his sweater. At that moment, [Ping Wa] saw blood flowing from the back of [Li Guofu]'s neck. He shouted incoherently, "Dad, he's bleeding, he's bleeding!" On the other side, Mr. Qian looked guiltily at the blood in [Li Guofu]'s hand, then kicked towards Mr. Qian.
0:6:34|0:6:47|The assistant next to him also lowered his head. After arriving at the police station, the police understood the situation and pushed the money boss and the assistant inside. Inside the house, the police apologized to [Li Guofu],
0:7:44|0:7:50|The police officer chuckled, then [Li Guofu] awkwardly said,
0:8:0|0:8:32|The police inside the house awkwardly smiled after listening, [Li Guofu] widened his eyes and urgently asked, then the police did not refuse to send the father and son back home. In the back seat of the police car, the son carefully looked around, while the father excitedly looked at the sunglasses in front of the car. At this moment, the police spoke to [Li Guofu],
0:8:39|0:8:48|The police officer smiled and pointed at the sunglasses in front of the car, saying,
0:9:5|0:9:14|[Li Guofu] carefully looked through the sunglasses, then put them on and turned to ask his son in the back seat, [Ping Wa], who nodded in response.
0:9:14|0:9:42|[Li Guofu] turned around with joy and looked at the rearview mirror in front of the car. Then he adjusted the mirror towards himself and smiled brightly. Shortly after, a police car slowly passed through the alley in front of [Li Guofu]'s house. Wearing sunglasses, [Li Guofu] sat in the police car and confidently spoke to the neighbors on the roadside. The neighbors were stunned for a moment, and after showing off, he got into the car through the window.
0:9:44|0:9:51|Walking through the streets and alleys, we arrived at the courtyard where [Li Guofu] lived. The car lights slowly swept over the neighbors who were moving things outside the house.
0:9:52|0:9:58|After the police car came to a stop, the father and son got out of the car. [Li Guofu] took off his sunglasses and bid farewell to the police officers.
0:10:4|0:10:13|Excited, [Li Guofu] raised his sunglasses and gestured thanks to the police. After saying goodbye to the police, [Li Guofu] put on his sunglasses again and walked towards the house. The neighbor next door saw this and shouted to [Li Guofu],
0:10:31|0:10:51|After finishing speaking, he proudly returned to the room. [Ping Wa] picked up the boiled kettle from the stove and poured foot-washing water for the two of them, while [Li Guofu] lay on the bed holding the new sunglasses carefully examining them, from the lenses to the legs of the glasses, and even every screw. He looked at them repeatedly, as if a child had finally received a long-awaited toy.
0:10:51|0:11:11|[Ping Wa] poured the foot-washing water, watching his father playing with sunglasses on the bed, reminding him to wash his feet. Then [Li Guofu] also put on sunglasses and stretched his feet into the foot bath, saying to his son as he soaked his feet,
0:11:14|0:11:23|[Ping Wa] responded expressionlessly,
0:11:27|0:11:39|[Ping Wa] sat unwillingly without saying a word. Seeing [Ping Wa] silent, [Li Guofu] sat up from the bed, took off his sunglasses, and solemnly patted [Ping Wa]'s arm. After seeing this, the son reluctantly said,
0:11:40|0:11:48|[Li Guofu] said discontentedly, while [Ping Wa] tried hard to learn.
0:11:55|0:12:5|[Li Guofu] lay back on the bed disappointedly, while [Ping Wa] turned to look at him and then turned back expressionless to stare into space. The two of them remained silent and continued soaking their feet.
0:12:54|0:13:2|Ping Wa stood on the side, twisting a bottle and watching the two of them.
0:13:20|0:13:27|Liu Guilan then took out money from her bag and said to [Li Guofu],
0:13:41|0:13:48|[Li Guofu] looked at the receding figure of Liu Guilan with emotion in his heart. At that moment, the neighbor beside him said,
0:14:4|0:14:27|At night, [Li Guofu] rode a three-wheeled motorcycle with Ping Wa, the two of them happily laughing on their way back. Suddenly, the engine stalled. [Li Guofu] tried to rev the throttle with no response, while Ping Wa habitually got off the vehicle and pushed it along, [Li Guofu] kept twisting the throttle on the motorcycle, attempting to reignite the engine.
0:14:27|0:14:42|At this moment, the driver on another road was on the phone when suddenly [Li Guofu] and Ping Wa appeared in front of the car. The driver, seeing Ping Wa still pushing, made a sharp turn and hit the roadside.
0:14:45|0:14:54|The driver quickly got out of the car and ran to the front to check. He found that the front bumper had been knocked off. He angrily walked towards the two people. [Li Guofu] quickly apologized when he saw this.
0:15:21|0:15:26|After the two pushed each other, [Li Guofu] picked up a stick from the car. The driver, seeing this, softened and said,
0:15:36|0:15:51|[Li Guofu] angrily finished speaking and then glared, the car owner sighed in resignation and said, then he grumbled as he walked towards the car, [Li Guofu] angrily stared at the car owner as he walked away with a stick, before turning and leaving.
0:15:51|0:16:16|Ping Wa stood by, at a loss, while the car owner helplessly dialed the company's number on the roadside. As the car owner heard the engine start, he looked at the father and son. After Ping Wa pushed the car for a while, the engine started running. Ping Wa jumped into the car, and the two of them stylishly drove away.
0:16:17|0:16:23|Watching the two of them leave, the car owner helplessly continued to listen to the insurance agent's phone call, while [Li Guofu] rode the tricycle quickly forward.
0:16:23|0:16:51|The scene shifts to the square, where [Li Guofu] changes into his dancing outfit. He sits on a bench, eating while chatting with [Liu Guilan]. He exclaims about the delicious food while eating quickly, while [Liu Guilan] sits beside him, smiling contentedly.
0:17:4|0:17:8|[Liu Guilan] sat aside, watching [Li Guofu] laughing happily.
0:17:16|0:17:23|After speaking, [Li Guofu] quickly took a sip of wine and anxiously looked at the other people in the square.
0:17:34|0:17:56|He quickly stuffed two more bites into his mouth, then picked up the suona and walked towards the square side by side with [Liu Guilan]. Dozens of elderly people in uniform clothing on the square were a fixed yangko dance team. Everyone who had been waiting for a long time saw the two coming over and happily cheered.
0:18:10|0:18:18|As the soul of the team, [Li Guofu] energetically plays the suona, and with the suona and drum sounds, everyone quickly immerses themselves in it.
0:18:22|0:18:46|With Li Guofu leading the yangko team, which is quite large, the group of three to fifty people is divided into two parts. Two middle-aged ladies with flower umbrellas lead others in dancing on the square, while other ladies holding two gorgeous fans stand in four rows, dancing each move in a neat and uniform manner. Liu Guilan is among them. On the side of the square, with Li Guofu's suona as the main instrument, there are various instruments such as big and small cymbals, big drums, and gongs.
0:18:46|0:18:50|[Liu Guilan] danced happily while looking at [Li Guofu] who was focused.
0:18:54|0:19:0|On the other side, [Li Faqun], who did not go to the square with [Li Guofu], walked alone towards a hair salon.
0:19:1|0:19:26|On a cold winter day, [Ping Wa] is walking through the alleyways in a thin coat. Inside a barber shop, a lady is massaging a customer's shoulders, and that person is [Li Li]. [Li Li] is vigorously tapping on the customer's shoulders with her hands clasped together, and the customer falls asleep with closed eyes, enjoying the comfortable massage.
0:19:29|0:19:49|At this moment, [Li Guofu] walked to the entrance of the barbershop. Upon reaching the entrance, he glanced inside and, seeing a customer, gently pushed the door open and walked in. After closing the door, he habitually sat on the sofa. Seeing [Li Guofu] in the mirror, [Ping Wa] was afraid of disturbing the customer, so she remained silent and continued working.
0:19:49|0:20:13|[Li Guofu] sat on the sofa and suddenly noticed a cast iron bowl with noodles on the stove in the corner. He glanced at [Ping Wa] who was working, then took out a sealed egg from his pocket. After opening the package, he put the egg in the bowl, and then put the empty packaging back into his pocket. He sat on the sofa quietly, waiting.
0:20:13|0:20:28|During this time, the phone of the guest rang. While the guest was answering the phone, [Li Li] stood up, tiredly rubbed her neck, and then turned to make a gesture to [Li Faqun].
0:20:36|0:20:56|The guest stood up while talking and took out a 100 yuan bill, placed it on the table, then turned and left. [Li Li] warmly greeted the departing guest, although the guest didn't look back, [Li Li] still habitually waved her hand. After the guest walked far away, [Li Li] closed the door. On the sofa, [Ping Wa] quietly watched [Li Li], then anxiously looked at the instant noodles on the stove.
0:20:58|0:21:7|After seeing off the guests, [Li Li] came in, walked straight to her seat, and started tidying up the things she had just used. After putting everything in place, [Li Li] looked at herself in the mirror.
0:21:7|0:21:28|Li Guofu looked up and down at Ping Wa. Ping Wa, who had a slightly chubby figure, was wearing knee-high boots with a thin flesh-colored stocking, a leather shorts reaching up to her thighs over the stocking, followed by a long sweater almost covering the shorts. She had fluffy hair and a slightly round face, which matched well with her outfit.
0:21:28|0:21:41|[Li Guofu] sat on the sofa, staring straight at [Ping Wa] who was tidying up. After finishing, [Ping Wa] sat down and started eating instant noodles with eggs from the stove, but [Li Guofu] had already left outside the door.
0:21:41|0:22:0|After the folk dance performance, everyone went home except for [Li Guofu] and [Liu Guilan], who were chatting by the city wall on the square. [Li Guofu] let out a long sigh, and seeing this, [Liu Guilan] spoke up,
0:22:6|0:22:15|Li Guofu hesitated and didn't speak, so Ping Wa quickly continued,
0:23:29|0:23:44|[Li Guofu] had a sudden inspiration and asked, [Liu Guilan] looked at the serious [Li Guofu] and thought for a moment,
0:25:19|0:25:26|[Li Guofu] shyly twisted his body nervously and asked,
0:25:36|0:25:52|After saying that, he awkwardly smiled, lowered his head in self-doubt, and she rode away on her bike. [Li Guofu] looked puzzled at Liu Guilan's back until she disappeared from his sight.
0:25:53|0:26:7|The next day, [Li Guofu] was still setting up his stall in the community as usual. At that moment, he was fixing a flat tire for a delivery guy who was eating a roujiamo. While fixing the tire, [Li Guofu] asked,
0:28:5|0:28:12|The young man looked at [Li Guofu] in confusion.
0:28:32|0:28:37|Excited, [Li Guofu] sat down to continue repairing the tire, while Xiaoge continued to eat meat sandwiches heartily in the car.
0:28:42|0:29:3|During dinner, the father and son placed the table by the stove. [Ping Wa] peeled garlic while [Li Guofu] scooped a spoonful of hot oil from the stove and poured it onto the noodles in [Ping Wa]'s bowl. He stirred it with chopsticks, and a bowl of authentic Shaanxi-style oil-splashed noodles was ready.
0:29:3|0:29:15|[Li Guofu] smiled satisfactorily at [Ping Wa], then he picked up the wine on the table and poured himself a glass. After taking a thoughtful sip, he said to [Ping Wa],
0:29:35|0:29:43|Ping Wa spoke up at this moment, "Would they want me?" Ping Wa repeated again, "Would they want me?"
0:29:55|0:30:16|[Ping Wa] frowned and nodded after listening, while [Li Guofu] scooped a spoonful of hot oil and poured it onto his noodles. The cooked dry noodles were topped with vegetables and chili powder. The aroma instantly filled the air after the hot oil cooking, and the two of them happily enjoyed their dinner.
0:30:16|0:30:24|The next day, [Li Guofu] brought [Ping Wa] to the express delivery company. In the spacious and bright corridor, employees in uniforms could be seen everywhere.
0:30:24|0:30:40|[Ping Wa] kept looking towards [Li Guofu] in the corridor. Soon, [Li Guofu] came out of the office, dressed in a suit with a leather bag sandwiched between his arm, and holding a lot of things in his hand. Unexpectedly, he was pushed out by the manager holding his hand. When they reached the door, Manager Wang impatiently said,
0:30:51|0:30:57|Ping Wa, standing aside, saw Li Guofu being shut out and angrily turned away.
0:30:57|0:31:28|[Li Guofu], who was still trying to figure things out outside the door, could only run out after seeing the situation. After being rejected, [Li Guofu] rode a tricycle back with his son. Both of them were extremely low in spirits on the car, silent, neither of them spoke. [Li Guofu] looked back at his son sitting in the back seat, who was holding the rejected gift silently. His seemingly plain face was frowning tightly, unable to hide the frustration in his heart.
0:31:28|0:31:36|Facing forward while driving, the father felt sadness and unwillingness welling up in his heart. [Li Guofu], who felt aggrieved for his son, also had tears in his eyes.
0:31:36|0:32:9|Returning home, [Li Guofu] was drumming on his homemade drum set, feeling at a loss. He looked at his disappointed son lying on the bed and comforted him. The son turned away from [Li Guofu], who suddenly realized and said,
0:32:14|0:32:19|His son, with tears in his eyes, suddenly sat up from the bed and said laboriously,
0:32:44|0:33:7|[Ping Wa] heard it and picked up his clothes and ran out. [Li Guofu] sat down helplessly, but accidentally touched the drum set. Startled, [Li Guofu] sat there without saying a word, just quietly staring at the lingering sound of the cymbals.
0:33:7|0:33:39|[Ping Wa] ran out of the house and arrived at Lili's hair salon. Lili was washing clothes while [Ping Wa] sat on the sofa. They watched TV together. After Lili finished the first wash and needed to add more water, she called [Ping Wa]. As [Ping Wa] was about to pour water into the basin, he saw the underwear that Lili was washing and accidentally spilled water on her.
0:33:39|0:34:8|He quickly put down the water kettle, but it was also knocked over on the ground. [Ping Wa] looked flustered at Li Li, who finished speaking and walked into the inner room. The overturned water kettle swayed next to the basin filled with underwear. Li Li changed clothes in the inner room, then came out without blaming [Ping Wa] too much. She sat down and continued washing clothes, while [Ping Wa] picked up the mop to dry the water on the floor. After drying it, he mopped the entire floor again, as if trying to make up for his mistake.
0:34:8|0:34:27|Lili continued to wash the clothes one by one without any concern. On the other side, the manager of the express delivery company and his girlfriend came out from the company, unaware that [Li Guofu] had already hidden behind the car. The unsuspecting couple walked towards the car, chatting and laughing.
0:34:47|0:34:53|[Li Guofu] smiled awkwardly, then Manager Wang continued,
0:35:18|0:35:23|After Li Guofu finished speaking and walked away with a smile, his girlfriend beside him complained.
0:35:31|0:35:53|After the scare, Manager Wang drove with his girlfriend towards the hot pot restaurant. When Manager Wang looked in the rearview mirror, he suddenly saw Li Guofu riding a bicycle following behind the car. Manager Wang turned his head in disbelief and watched Li Guofu pedaling hard. Li Guofu in the back saw Manager Wang looking at him, smiled at him, waved, and then pedaled even harder.
0:35:53|0:36:25|At this moment, the girlfriend also noticed [Li Guofu]. Manager Wang let go of his girlfriend's hand, tightly gripped the steering wheel with both hands, prepared to accelerate and leave [Li Guofu] behind. The car smoothly turned a corner and sped up on the unobstructed road. Manager Wang kept looking in the rearview mirror from time to time, constantly confirming that [Li Guofu] was not following. Later, the two of them happily finished eating hotpot at the hotpot restaurant.
0:36:25|0:36:27|Manager Wang told a joke to his girlfriend, [Li Guofu].
0:36:42|0:37:5|At this moment, the waiter walked towards the two of them. With a look of surprise, Manager Wang turned around to see a familiar figure. He then got up and walked towards [Li Guofu]. His girlfriend sitting across from him also curiously watched [Li Guofu]'s back. Manager Wang approached slowly and, upon realizing it was [Li Guofu], impatiently said as he walked back,
0:37:18|0:37:24|After sitting down, [Li Guofu] awkwardly smiled at Manager Wang, who also smiled and said,
0:37:27|0:37:34|Manager Wang leaned in slightly closer to [Li Guofu] and said seriously,
0:40:3|0:40:10|To celebrate Ping Wa finding a job, Li Guofu bought chicken, duck, fish, and meat, preparing to share with the neighbors in the evening. Neighbor Lao Zhang walked over and said,
0:40:59|0:41:23|The two continued to wipe the car. [Li Guofu] saw the smile on [Ping Wa]'s face, and he smiled with relief, feeling a big weight lifted off his heart. [Ping Wa] put on his helmet, wore his uniform and new shoes, rode the shiny electric bike to the front of the barbershop, looking radiant as he gazed at Li Li inside. He honked the horn, and upon hearing it, Li Li walked out of the house.
0:41:24|0:41:42|Standing outside the door, Li Li crossed her arms in front of her chest, carefully examining the transformed [Ping Wa]. She nodded at [Ping Wa], then remembered something and walked towards the house. [Ping Wa] sat in the car, quietly looking inside, without saying a word.
0:41:42|0:42:8|After a while, Li Li came out with her bag and sat in the back seat of [Ping Wa]'s car. [Ping Wa] drove through the rugged alleyways with Li Li sitting sideways in the back seat, holding onto [Ping Wa]'s waist with both hands. The two of them happily rode towards the city center, their faces filled with smiles of happiness. Passersby also looked at them as they passed by. [Ping Wa] was also enjoying the joyful time spent with Li Li.
0:42:8|0:42:28|When riding on a sparsely populated road, [Ping Wa] sped up to scare Li Li on the back seat, amusing her in his somewhat childish way. Meanwhile, at Li Guofu's house, everyone happily sang songs after dinner.
0:43:15|0:43:44|At this moment, [Ping Wa] and Li Li arrived at the upscale shopping mall in the city center. Inside the beautifully decorated mall, [Ping Wa] followed behind Li Li with a helmet in his arms. Li Li strolled in front of various cosmetic counters. When she reached a counter, she picked up a sample on display and looked at it. The enthusiastic salesperson at the counter said,
0:44:9|0:44:18|Li Guofu followed the salesperson and ran to undergo the test. The salesperson's device then moved slowly on Li Li's face, and the screen on the computer was also moving.
0:44:37|0:44:43|After saying that, she took out a set of cosmetics and placed it in front of [Li Guofu].
0:45:9|0:45:22|After Lili got up from the counter, she pulled Ping Wa, who was waiting beside her. Ping Wa followed and took note of this set of cosmetics. In the evening, Liu Guilan and Li Guofu had dinner at the restaurant.
0:45:37|0:45:42|While eating, she filled a bowl of food for [Li Guofu] and poured him a glass of wine.
0:46:3|0:46:10|[Li Guofu] incredulously pursed his lips,
0:47:13|0:47:19|At this moment, [Ping Wa]'s blind date partner walked in with a bowl of noodles.
0:47:59|0:48:14|After saying that, the blind date partner Xiao Ya turned and left. [Li Guofu] looked satisfied as he watched Xiao Ya's back. Liu Guilan turned proudly to [Li Guofu] and [Li Guofu] couldn't help but feel content. He raised his glass to Liu Guilan.
0:48:22|0:48:29|Back home, [Li Guofu] had [Ping Wa] put on his suit while he sat down to polish his shoes.
0:48:38|0:48:58|[Ping Wa] looked at himself in the mirror wearing a suit, feeling very awkward. [Li Guofu] glanced at him, then threw a tie to him. [Ping Wa] looked down at the tie in his hand with confusion, then looked at himself in the mirror. He frowned, sighed, and said slowly, "I have to go to work tomorrow," using going to work as an excuse.
0:49:10|0:49:22|After listening, [Ping Wa] threw his tie on the bed and impatiently said, "I'm not going." His father hit him with a shoe brush while speaking.
0:49:32|0:49:51|Sitting on the edge of the bed, [Ping Wa] lay down in frustration, while [Li Guofu] saw his rebellious son helplessly raise the brush as if to hit him, then restrained himself. He continued to polish the shoes, finishing one and picking up another, sighing deeply. He reluctantly continued to polish [Ping Wa]'s shoes.
0:49:52|0:50:2|The next evening, Liu Guilan brought [Li Guofu] and [Ping Wa] to Xiaoya's restaurant. Xiaoya poured tea for them one by one in the private room, while Xiaoya's father took out a cigarette and said,
0:50:32|0:50:52|Shortly after, the parents of both sides walked out. The last to leave, [Li Guofu], whispered worriedly in [Ping Wa]'s ear. [Ping Wa] looked out with an expressionless face, watching his father leave with a sideways glance. Once outside, the parents chatted with each other.
0:50:59|0:51:17|In the private room, Ya Ya spoke first, while [Ping Wa] kept a straight face, lowered his head and remained silent. [Ping Wa] continued to stay silent, not showing any change in expression.
0:51:42|0:51:48|At this moment, [Ping Wa] nodded. Seeing that [Ping Wa] still didn't speak, Xiaoya suddenly became emotional and questioned,
0:51:53|0:52:22|[Ping Wa] continued to nod silently, while Xiao Ya anxiously asked, [Ping Wa] repeated the same action, Xiao Ya, feeling anxious, hesitated to speak, while the parents continued chatting. [Li Guofu] nervously glanced inside the private room from time to time, [Ping Wa] sat there motionless. As Xiao Ya felt more and more wronged, she pouted and started to cry.
0:52:22|0:52:28|Li Faqun finally looked up at the increasingly crying Ping Wa, then got up and walked out the door.
0:52:29|0:52:50|Li Guofu walked out of the private room without looking back and strode towards the door of the restaurant. Seeing Ping Wa going out, his father hurriedly ran into the room and scolded the crying little girl before chasing after her. At this moment, Liu Guilan and Ping Wa's parents also walked towards the private room. Seeing this, Liu Guilan quickly asked,
0:53:44|0:53:50|Li Guofu was angrily hitting while talking to Ping Wa outside.
0:53:58|0:54:15|Impatient [Ping Wa] quickly ran away, leaving his father, unable to catch up, standing in place cursing angrily. He then kicked a utility pole in frustration, causing an advertisement on top to suddenly loosen. [Li Guofu] swiftly dodged out of the way.
0:54:18|0:54:24|The blind date situation gradually turned a new leaf as time passed, and [Li Guofu] also gradually became acquainted with his colleagues.
0:54:24|0:54:40|At noon, Li Guofu and his colleagues were happily eating belt noodles together. Although Li Guofu had hearing and language barriers, his enthusiastic colleagues did not discriminate against him. They still talked to Li Guofu from time to time. This seemingly ordinary matter brought special joy to Li Guofu's heart.
0:54:40|0:54:49|After work, [Li Guofu] often goes to Lily's hair salon. When there are no customers, he watches TV with her. When there are customers, [Li Guofu] helps out.
0:54:50|0:55:1|While Li Guofu quietly held the necessary tools on the side as Li Li permed the customer's hair, Li Li conveniently picked up the hair dye in Li Guofu's hand and applied it to the customer without the need to run back and forth.
0:55:1|0:55:8|When Li Guofu was working, Ping Wa quietly watched her, enjoying their exclusive time together in the hair salon.
0:55:8|0:55:22|The next day, [Li Guofu] and his father went to work together. When the tricycle stalled again, [Li Guofu] didn't push from behind this time. Instead, he connected the tricycle to the electric bike and used a rope to pull the tricycle behind.
0:55:22|0:55:33|[Li Guofu] wearing sunglasses, arrogantly looks at his son on the tricycle. The two occasionally shout loudly. Up front, [Li Guofu] looks back at the spirited [Li Guofu] from time to time, and then laughs happily along.
0:55:33|0:55:44|The scene of the two of them together is very heartwarming. After work, [Li Guofu] went to the mall alone to look at the cosmetics in the display case. The salesperson next to him was promoting to other customers.
0:56:9|0:56:22|In the evening, [Li Guofu] and [Ping Wa] were having dinner at home while watching a music program on TV. [Li Guofu] looked at the TV and asked [Ping Wa],
0:56:28|0:56:37|Ping Wa glanced at [Li Guofu] and said vaguely, "He's more capable than you."
0:56:45|0:57:4|Ping Wa ate noodles nonchalantly and glanced at the musical instruments.
0:57:6|0:57:19|[Li Guofu] thought for a moment and asked Ping Wa. Ping Wa put down his chopsticks and explained, "They only wash their hair, they don't shave their heads. Rich people don't wash their hair at home."
0:57:40|0:57:49|After listening to Ping Wa's words, [Li Guofu] pondered with his eyes rolling. After dinner, Ping Wa went to Lili's hair salon on the street as usual.
0:57:49|0:58:18|[Li Guofu] finished washing the dishes at home, playing music with a touch of romance. He took off his tattered leather jacket and walked to the mirror, picking up the suit on the mannequin next to him. He put on the suit, and in the mirror, the mannequin, half a head taller than [Li Guofu], was dressed in his proudest outfit. After putting on the suit, [Li Guofu] took off the tie from the mannequin's neck and hung it around his own neck, staring blankly at his reflection in the mirror.
0:58:18|0:58:33|He found that he couldn't tie a tie at all. After blinking his eyes and thinking for a while, he started to try, putting the tie on and off in a decent manner. However, after several attempts, he found that it was all wrong. He impatiently pulled the tie off his neck.
0:58:39|0:58:54|He then picked up the sunglasses hanging on the mannequin's head and put them on his own face. After carefully examining himself with the sunglasses on, he adjusted his beard and shook his head. He looked at himself from different angles, then smiled satisfactorily, patted the mannequin's face, and walked out the door.
0:58:56|0:59:8|[Li Guofu] went out and arrived at the front of Lili's hair salon. He was dressed in a suit, but wearing a very mismatched pair of sneakers and white socks on his feet, with his suit pants cut short.
0:59:8|0:59:15|Li Guofu revealed his long johns. He walked lightly to the door, straightened his clothes once again, and pushed the door open.
0:59:17|0:59:22|In the room, Li Guofu and Ping Wa both stood up when they saw the situation. Li Guofu exclaimed in surprise,
0:59:23|0:59:38|[Li Guofu] arrogantly said, then sat down. Beside him, [Li Li] watched as [Li Faqun] covered his mouth and laughed, while [Li Faqun] stood beside him, staring blankly at his father without a word. Seeing [Li Li] laughing with her hand over her mouth, [Li Guofu] spoke up.
0:59:44|0:59:54|After speaking, [Lili] took out a towel and draped it over [Li Guofu]'s shoulders. On the side, [Li Faqun] snapped out of his daze, still unaware of the purpose of his father coming to have his hair washed.
0:59:54|1:0:15|With a puzzled look on his face, [Li Guofu] watched as [Li Li] sprayed water evenly on his hair after draping a towel over him. Meanwhile, [Ping Wa] looked at the scene in front of him, lowered his head thoughtfully, and after a moment of contemplation, he felt uncomfortable and got up to leave the hair salon.
1:0:17|1:0:43|[Lili] watched as [Li Faqun] walked out without saying a word, continuing to spray water with a spray bottle. Sitting there, [Li Guofu] didn't even turn his head when he heard the sound. After wetting his hair, [Lili] used shampoo to scratch [Li Guofu]'s scalp. She chuckled as she scratched, looking at [Li Guofu] in the mirror wearing sunglasses and furrowing his brow. [Lili] mischievously sped up the scratching.
1:0:43|1:0:56|Li Guofu, who had never experienced such a service before, was scratched by Ping Wa until his scalp tingled and his whole body went limp. Li Guofu sat in the chair, tightly squeezing his legs together as if sitting on pins and needles, gripping the armrests tightly, feeling the hairs on his body standing on end.
1:0:56|1:1:12|Even so, [Li Guofu] still maintained a calm expression, sitting there without changing his face, waiting silently for the hair washing to finish. As [Lili] repeatedly scratched [Li Guofu]'s scalp with her fingertips, he gradually got used to it, and even his expression became much more relaxed.
1:1:12|1:1:27|After the end of this wonderful hair washing experience, [Li Li] used a hairdryer to dry [Li Guofu]'s hair. Having just experienced a scalp massage, blow-drying hair was clearly a piece of cake for [Li Guofu].
1:1:27|1:1:34|He sat in the chair with sunglasses on indifferently. After carefully blow-drying Li Guofu's hair, Ping Wa took off the towel and said,
1:1:36|1:1:50|[Li Guofu] stood up and leaned in front of the mirror, carefully examining himself. Then he took out 20 yuan and placed it on the table, saying proudly,
1:1:52|1:2:2|Surprised, [Li Guofu] took off his sunglasses and looked at Li Li, then glanced at the 20 yuan on the table. He then took out two 10 yuan bills and placed them on the table, continuing to speak.
1:2:4|1:2:7|[Li Guofu] awkwardly put on sunglasses and walked out.
1:2:15|1:2:32|The next day was payday at the express delivery company. Everyone crowded around the office door, chatting in groups as they received their wages, discussing plans to go out for drinks after getting paid.
1:2:32|1:2:54|The spacious corridor was crowded by the delivery guy in uniform. Among the crowd, [Li Guofu] was also eagerly waiting to receive his salary. Fortunately, the process of receiving for each person was quick. They just needed to tell the finance staff their name, and the staff would find it in the form. Finally, [Li Guofu] walked in.
1:2:59|1:3:18|[Li Guofu] quickly took out a pen from his pocket after listening, wrote his name in the palm of his hand, and handed it to the finance department. [Li Guofu] nodded vigorously, and then the finance department started looking for it in the form.
1:3:21|1:3:39|[Li Guofu] mistakenly thought there was an issue with the finances, so he reached out his hand towards the finance department, pointed to the name on his palm. The finance staff nodded, then searched through the prepared salary envelopes, confirming on both the envelope and the form that there was no mistake. Finally, picking up the phone, he turned to [Li Guofu] and said,
1:4:0|1:4:16|[Li Guofu] strained to listen to the voice on the phone outside the door, while the employees peeked through the crack to see what was happening inside. [Li Guofu] angrily pushed the door open and ran out, leaving his puzzled colleagues speechless. The manager quickly followed him out.
1:4:33|1:4:56|In the corridor, [Li Guofu] angrily takes off the company uniform and throws it on the ground while running. The manager behind picks up the clothes and continues to shout and chase after him. Exiting the courier company, [Li Guofu] walks alone on the street, feeling frustrated about working hard during this period but not getting paid.
1:5:35|1:5:51|[Li Guofu] hung up the phone and went to find Manager Wang. [Liu Guilan] stopped in worry, watching [Li Guofu] walk away.
1:5:52|1:6:0|In the car, after the manager and [Li Guofu] discussed the situation during the day, both of them sat in silence, not knowing what to do. Suddenly, Manager Wang asked,
1:6:45|1:7:1|Shortly after, Manager Wang got off the car and walked towards the home of [Li Guofu], who watched Manager Wang with grateful eyes. Manager Wang quickly reached the door of [Li Guofu]'s house and knocked. Inside the car, [Li Guofu] was afraid that [Ping Wa] would see him, so he hid himself further down.
1:7:1|1:7:19|At this moment, [Ping Wa] opened the door and was somewhat surprised to see the manager standing there. The manager took out his wallet from his pocket, pulled out 2000 yuan, and handed it to [Ping Wa]. After taking the money, [Ping Wa] looked at the manager, who patted his shoulder, said a few encouraging words, and then walked towards the car.
1:7:19|1:7:36|[Ping Wa] looked at the money, then at the manager in the distance, entered the room and closed the door. Meanwhile, in the car, [Li Guofu] seemed relieved to see this scene, and then turned to look at Manager Wang who had walked to the front of the car. Manager Wang opened the door and sat in the car, while [Li Guofu] anxiously asked with a smile on his face,
1:7:51|1:7:55|Then he opened the car door and thanked [Li Guofu] again.
1:8:0|1:8:18|In the car, Manager Wang looked at [Li Guofu] walking towards his home with a sense of admiration. Being attentive, [Li Guofu] was afraid that his son would discover that Manager Wang came to deliver money because of him. Therefore, he didn't rush into the house after getting out of the car, but instead paced back and forth at the door. In order to protect his son's self-esteem,
1:8:18|1:8:26|In the cold winter in the north, the elderly [Li Guofu], despite dressing warmly, still needs to walk back and forth to ensure the temperature of his body.
1:8:26|1:8:46|[Li Guofu] clamped the suona with his arm, constantly rubbing his hands, and occasionally peeked through the crack of the door into the house. He wanted to go in but hesitated, as if the longer he waited, the less likely he would be discovered. At this moment, the neighbor suddenly came out of the outhouse with his pants in hand, looked at [Li Guofu] and asked,
1:9:10|1:9:16|To cover up the lie, [Li Guofu] awkwardly pretended to be exercising in the yard, stretching his arms and moving around.
1:9:17|1:9:29|Seeing the neighbor enter the house, [Li Guofu] gently pushed open the door and walked in. Walking into the inner room and lifting the door curtain, he looked somewhat flustered at his son watching TV.
1:9:32|1:9:40|Later, seeing the money Manager Wang had sent on the table, [Li Guofu] pretended to have just found out and said to [Ping Wa],
1:11:8|1:11:14|[Ping Wa] wiped away tears and stood up excitedly, saying, "What's the use of just talking nonsense? If you're capable, go on TV and talk!"
1:11:19|1:11:25|[Li Guofu] watched as [Ping Wa] promised tearfully with a sense of inferiority.
1:11:39|1:11:46|[Li Guofu] defiantly made a bold statement. At this point, the relationship between the father and son hit rock bottom once again due to work.
1:11:49|1:12:6|A few days later, Li Guofu and Ping Wa finished collecting scrap as usual in the evening. Riding their tricycle on the way back home, the engine stalled again. Ping Wa, as usual, started pushing the tricycle, but after a few steps, he let go of the handle and stood still.
1:12:6|1:12:33|In the car, [Li Guofu] noticed something unusual and sat there with a vacant look, deep in thought. After the car was pushed for a while, [Li Guofu] stepped on the brake. He slowly turned his head to look at [Ping Wa], who was standing still and lost in thought. The son was feeling low, looking at the roadside, recalling the experiences they had been through recently. They both came from the countryside, and he, being disabled, could only rely on collecting scrap for a living in the city with his father.
1:12:33|1:12:56|Any decent thing has nothing to do with oneself. Thinking about this, [Ping Wa] looked despairingly and helplessly into the distance. After looking at his despondent son for a while, [Li Guofu] turned back. He knew why his son was like this, but as a father, he didn't know how to talk to his son. Instead, he lowered his head in frustration on the tricycle. The two of them appeared particularly desolate on the deserted road.
1:12:56|1:13:1|After some time, one evening, [Li Guofu] was helping out at the hair salon.
1:13:3|1:13:20|[Ping Wa] had just finished washing a regular customer's hair and was blow-drying it. [Li Guofu] added charcoal to the stove and sat on the sofa watching [Ping Wa]. While washing the hair, an old customer, Wang Ge, invited [Ping Wa] to join a party. After blow-drying Wang Ge's hair, [Ping Wa] politely declined.
1:13:48|1:13:54|Wang Ge turned around and looked at Li Guofu on the sofa, saying to Ping Wa,
1:14:5|1:14:14|After Wang Ge walked out of the store, Ping Wa, who was reluctant to go, was afraid of offending the old customers. With a sullen face and head lowered, he eventually compromised.
1:15:30|1:15:35|And she just kept changing poses on the sofa, taking photos without paying attention to [Li Guofu]'s intentions.
1:15:42|1:15:50|Feeling bored, [Li Guofu] stood up and walked out of the private room to go to the restroom. Inside the room, no one even bothered to look up at him, continuing on.
1:15:53|1:16:1|[Li Guofu] shuttles through the corridor of the KTV looking for the restroom, with the sound of songs from other private rooms still ringing in his ears, creating a noisy atmosphere.
1:16:2|1:16:25|[Li Guofu] walked into the restroom and closed the door. At that moment, the cleaning lady knocked on the door and asked, then pushed it open to find [Li Guofu] in the middle of using the toilet. [Li Guofu] hurriedly pulled up his pants, and the cleaning lady, annoyed, complained as she walked away. Inside, [Li Guofu] put on his pants and breathed heavily in anger.
1:16:30|1:16:46|A moment later, he turned around and quickly walked back to the private room. Upon returning to the room, [Li Guofu] felt a surge of grievance and anger.
1:16:52|1:17:0|After Wang Ge finished speaking, [Li Faqun] couldn't help but stand up, pick up the full bottle of white wine on the table, and drink it in big gulps with his head tilted back.
1:17:2|1:17:26|[Li Guofu] had tears in his eyes. Even though he couldn't swallow the white wine, he still held up the bottle. Throughout the night, everyone remained silent and looked at [Li Guofu]. At this moment, [Ping Wa] came over and snatched the bottle from him. [Ping Wa] had a serious expression and sharp eyes as she looked at [Li Guofu]. After glancing at [Ping Wa], [Li Guofu] lowered his head with a vacant look and gasped for breath heavily.
1:17:26|1:17:34|He, who was drunk, was then helped home by [Li Li].
1:17:46|1:18:18|At this moment, [Li Guofu] walked out of the door. [Lili] said apologetically, but [Li Guofu] didn't say a word. He grabbed [Ping Wa], who was about to fall, and held him in his arms. Then he gave a fierce look at [Lili], slammed the door shut heavily, leaving [Lili] standing alone at the door. When they got home, [Li Guofu] helped [Ping Wa] lie down on the bed, took off his clothes, and tucked him in.
1:18:18|1:18:53|Drunk [Ping Wa] occasionally hummed in his mouth. [Li Guofu] walked over and took his son's hearing aid. He looked at [Ping Wa], then at the hearing aid, sighed, and stared blankly. Seeing [Ping Wa] lying on the bed humming non-stop, [Li Guofu] helplessly placed the hearing aid on the table and sighed deeply.
1:18:53|1:19:10|Sitting in front of the table with a downcast look, wearing a coat with a fur collar, in the simple room with dim lighting, [Li Guofu] appeared somewhat weary. He was silently recalling the events and his son's self-deprecating words. Refusing to give up, he glanced at his son lying on the bed.
1:19:10|1:19:31|Recalling his own promise, he became even more determined to appear on TV. To encourage [Ping Wa], the next day, accompanied by [Liu Guilan] and the yangko dance team, he arrived at the TV program audition venue. Outside the door, all the contestants were actively preparing.
1:19:39|1:19:46|[Liu Guilan] handed a egg to [Li Guofu] who was eating with his mouth full.
1:19:55|1:19:58|After listening, he started eating heartily again.
1:20:5|1:20:30|[Li Guofu] was eating and drinking while swallowing water. Mmm, aiyah, yes, keep eating me, hahaha. After [Li Guofu] struggled to finish the sixth egg, he kept burping non-stop, with everyone around him giving advice. As the time drew closer, the other contestants were nervously practicing outside.
1:20:30|1:20:48|Only [Li Guofu] was still eating eggs. After a hot and sexy lady finished her dance, [Li Guofu] slowly walked down from the stage. He timidly bowed to the judges with a suona in his hand. The judges below spoke first,
1:20:55|1:20:59|The two judges below the stage looked at each other and smiled, saying,
1:21:50|1:21:58|[Li Guofu] scratched his nose in confusion,
1:22:34|1:22:52|He then placed the suona on the ground and cleared his throat. He hunched his back, somewhat timidly, and struck a rock star pose, singing the lyrics in his mind to the beat.
1:23:29|1:23:45|[Li Guofu] bowed and walked out. Outside the door, everyone anxiously asked, looking at each other without saying a word.
1:23:47|1:23:53|[Li Guofu] did not understand the subtext of the judges and started practicing day and night when he returned home.
1:23:53|1:24:51|The large cymbals, small cymbals, large drums, small drums, and other instruments were assembled by [Li Guofu] with steel wires and rollers, connected to a homemade pedal. In this way, [Li Guofu] used both hands and feet to strike them. His son, who was about to lie down to sleep, was disturbed by the noise, tossing and turning in bed. He then went out to the hair salon, where he continued to help [Ping Wa] with miscellaneous tasks as usual.
1:24:52|1:25:4|[Li Guofu] stood on a chair, concentrating on fixing the leaking water heater with a wrench. After tightening the screws and testing the switch, [Ping Wa] watching nearby, saw that the repair was almost done and said to [Li Guofu],
1:25:10|1:25:39|Hearing this, [Li Guofu] put down the work in his hands, and after saying that, he patted [Ping Wa] on the shoulder, then walked to the seat to prepare the hair washing products. [Li Guofu] sat on the seat, staring blankly at the mirror, while [Lili] behind him, like other customers, washed his hair, spraying water on his hair and applying shampoo, with 10 fingers constantly moving over [Li Guofu]'s scalp.
1:25:39|1:26:2|[Li Guofu] had an expressionless face, looking ahead with empty eyes, constantly thinking about the impending departure of [Ping Wa]. There were too many words left unsaid in his heart, and the emotions of parting spread in [Li Guofu]'s heart. As he thought, his head lowered more and more. [Ping Wa] lifted [Li Guofu]'s lowering head and looked at him through the mirror. Even though [Ping Wa] seemed indifferent, she was also filled with mixed emotions and countless thoughts.
1:26:2|1:26:19|In the emotional farewell, both of them remained silent. [Li Guofu] bid farewell to him in her own way, even though his attention was not on getting a haircut. He was massaged by [Li Guofu] in a way that made him swallow saliva, causing his body hair to stand on end, gripping the armrest of the chair tightly.
1:26:19|1:26:30|[Li Guofu] calmly looks at [Lili] in the mirror, cherishing the last few days together more and more. Gradually, a hint of tears appears in [Li Guofu]'s eyes.
1:26:34|1:26:42|As time passed, the broadcast time was getting closer. After hanging up the phone in the recording office, the staff said to the judges,
1:27:11|1:27:16|At this moment, the program director looked at the computer recording the show that day,
1:27:18|1:27:24|The staff then pressed pause, freezing the frame on the face of [Li Guofu]. Meanwhile, [Li Faqun] arrived at the mall.
1:27:43|1:27:49|The salesperson watched as [Li Guofu] walked away quickly. Meanwhile, [Ping Wa] was nervously preparing backstage for the competition.
1:27:56|1:28:12|Liu Guilan handed the suona to [Li Guofu], then took off her sunglasses. The two smiled slightly intimately and awkwardly. At this moment, the stage crew had already placed the stand assembled by [Li Guofu] in the center of the stage. The host said,
1:28:41|1:28:48|Keep it up. Liu Guilan looked at the back of [Li Guofu] as he went on stage, filled with happiness and excitement, with indescribable feelings written all over her face towards [Li Guofu].
1:28:48|1:29:9|In the dimly lit waiting area, [Li Guofu] in a leather jacket, holding a suona, nervously takes deep breaths, thinking about his insecure son. [Li Guofu]'s anxious expression gradually turns resolute, as he slowly puts on sunglasses. The light in front of the stage shines through the cracks onto [Li Guofu]'s cheeks, giving him a somewhat old rock star look.
1:29:11|1:29:17|The gate of the waiting area gradually opens at this moment, and in front of the stage, the spotlight generously shines on [Li Guofu].
1:29:17|1:29:35|[Li Guofu] stood confidently with his head slightly raised, showing no trace of fear. He knew that he carried a love for music, his son's insecurity, and the expectations of Liu Guilan and everyone else. As the door opened completely, [Li Guofu] looked through his sunglasses at the dazzling spotlight, then walked slowly towards the stage.
1:29:35|1:29:53|When [Li Guofu] walked confidently to the center of the stage, applause erupted. After a deep bow to the audience, [Li Guofu] sat down in front of the drum set. As soon as [Li Guofu] was ready to start, everyone quieted down, and then [Li Guofu] picked up the suona to begin the performance.
1:31:5|1:31:8|At this moment, [Li Guofu] walked up to the hair salon holding cosmetics.
1:31:15|1:31:24|Lili waved to [Li Guofu] to come in. When he entered, he looked at the TV in surprise and saw his father.
1:32:6|1:32:20|The audience was infected by the music of the old man on the stage wearing sunglasses and gradually graying hair. Everyone waved their glow sticks in unison, and the judges on the judging panel nodded to the rhythm. Backstage, [Liu Guilan] clapped her hands with tears of joy.
1:32:21|1:32:29|The neighbors in front of the TV are also swaying to the music, while [Li Guofu] is staring in disbelief at his father who is actually on TV.
