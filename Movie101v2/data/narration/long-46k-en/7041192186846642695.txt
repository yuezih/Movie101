0:3:28|0:3:37|[Chen Xiang] came to the front of the case to register her name, and the chief eunuch standing behind her flicked her ear.
0:3:39|0:3:48|[Chen Xiang] trembled and turned around unsteadily, looking up. [Chen Xiang] dared not meet his eyes directly and lowered her head.
0:3:59|0:4:9|Chen Xiang's voice had just fallen, and the palace gate slowly opened, the selected maids standing at the door curiously peering inside.
0:4:34|0:4:46|Accompanied by the chief eunuch, [Chen Xiang] followed the team all the way to the depths of the palace. As the team climbed the steps, [Chen Xiang] suddenly touched his ear and shouted loudly.
0:4:47|0:4:55|[Chen Xiang] chased after the steadily falling beads, running further and further away.
0:4:57|0:5:10|[Chen Xiang] picked up the beads and looked up, in front of her was a desolate palace. She had no idea where she was, but curiosity drove her to step into the courtyard.
0:5:10|0:5:23|The palace was in a state of disrepair, with weeds growing in the courtyard. [Chen Xiang] cautiously walked inside, when suddenly a cold wind blew around her. Feeling something amiss, [Chen Xiang] slowed down and stopped.
0:5:23|0:5:49|She turned and ran towards the door, but suddenly heard a strange sound behind her. [Chen Xiang] turned around and saw an eye through the crack in the door. At that moment, the chief eunuch approached and slapped [Chen Xiang] across the face, causing her earring to fly out.
0:5:53|0:6:5|A group of eunuchs suddenly burst in from the door, shouting for the thirteenth prince. The chief eunuch hoisted [Chen Xiang] on his shoulder and walked out, [Chen Xiang] couldn't help but look back.
0:6:6|0:6:13|The closed shop door was opened, and a noble-looking young man walked out, who was the thirteenth prince [Yin Xiang].
0:6:13|0:6:28|A large group of crows flew out of the palace, frightening the eunuchs into chaos. [Yin Xiang] stood at the door, with a cold and indifferent look hiding a hint of sadness. An old eunuch rushed forward to throw himself at [Yin Xiang], only to be pushed away by him.
0:6:28|0:6:51|A group of eunuchs behind rushed forward, with [Yin Xiang] roaring and struggling, but they firmly pressed him to the ground, his hands and feet bound, unable to move. And behind them, there was a huge golden cage hanging in the shop, [Chen Xiang] widened her eyes, looking at everything happening in front of her with a pensive expression.
0:6:54|0:7:1|The cold cage emits light, slowly transforming into a young master, followed by the title of the film. Now, let's dive into the main feature of the movie.
0:7:13|0:7:36|After scolding, [Chen Xiang] looked around and slowly turned to leave. The young palace maids stood in two rows, all bowing their heads and not daring to look at her. After [Chen Xiang] left, everyone breathed a sigh of relief and started laughing and joking. An older palace maid, acting domineering, barged into the young maids' dormitory.
0:7:36|0:7:45|[Chen Xiang] stood by the bed with a bag of snacks, attracting the attention of the old palace maids. They approached and surrounded [Chen Xiang], who was still smiling foolishly.
0:7:59|0:8:6|Tearing up, the snack fell on the ground, [Chen Xiang] with red eyes was slapped by an old palace maid.
0:8:10|0:8:16|[Chen Xiang] shrank into a ball, surrounded by eerie laughter.
0:8:24|0:8:37|Outside the window stood a long-haired female ghost. The palace maids screamed in fear, leaving only [Chen Xiang] in the room, who had to curl up in the corner.
0:8:38|0:8:58|The female ghost floated in from the doorway and headed straight for [Chen Xiang]. [Chen Xiang] was so scared that she covered her eyes. Through her fingers, she saw the ghost's hand, which appeared no different from a human's, so she slowly lowered her hand. The ghost pushed aside her hair, revealing herself to be a young palace maid about the same age as [Chen Xiang]. The maid sat on the bed and started eating the snacks prepared by [Chen Xiang].
0:9:18|0:9:44|Chen Xiang and Yin Xiang were attracted by a singing voice and sneaked out. Holding hands, they followed the singing through a long corridor, where a beautiful woman was dancing.
0:10:39|0:10:48|In the icy and snowy landscape, the woman jumps with great effort, like a celestial being in the sky, as beautiful as a painting.
0:11:11|0:11:27|Aunt's side was the dancing woman, who was now frozen into a snowman. [Chen Xiang] couldn't help but look back in the procession, a few eunuchs lifted the dancer's body, but one of them slipped and fell from the bridge, landing heavily on the ground.
0:11:36|0:11:44|[Liu Li] picked up his bowl and exchanged a smile with [Chen Xiang] across the table.
0:11:46|0:12:5|At night, [Liu Li] mysteriously took out an egg and handed it to [Chen Xiang]. The two of them lay together, playing around as if no one else was around, bringing a touch of warmth to the cold palace. Gradually, everything fell into place, with both [Liu Li] and [Chen Xiang] tidying up their appearances and becoming more adept at handling matters in the palace.
0:12:14|0:12:20|The maids each held a round watermelon and angrily threw them to the ground, shattering them into pieces.
0:12:21|0:12:37|The days passed by like this, day after day, year after year. The young palace maids who entered the palace years ago gradually lost their youthful innocence to the passage of time. The once naive girls have grown into graceful young ladies, with [Liu Li] and [Chen Xiang] relying on each other in the palace, spending seven long years together.
0:13:40|0:13:46|[Liu Li] was eager to find out the whereabouts of the young masters in [Chun Shou]'s hands, but [Chen Xiang] on the side was indifferent.
0:14:6|0:14:13|[Liu Li] held the sachet containing the whereabouts of the Ninth Prince tightly in her hand, approaching [Chen Xiang].
0:14:51|0:15:1|Aunt called outside the door, and the two stopped. The next day, Ru Yi Pavilion was in chaos.
0:15:18|0:15:39|[Chen Xiang] sat in front of a table, staring at a painting. [Liu Li] waved to her from the second floor, and she reluctantly put down the painting. In the center of the hall hung a portrait, the same one [Chen Xiang] had just seen, depicting a man in armor riding a war horse, with a handsome face and captivating eyes.
0:16:0|0:16:27|[Chun Shou]'s vivid description made [Chen Xiang] feel as if she were there. She saw the Thirteenth Prince galloping on a horse from a distance, followed by a group of black panthers. One of the panthers seized [Yin Xiang] and knocked him to the ground, while the others pounced on him. In an instant, [Yin Xiang]'s armor was torn to shreds, leaving numerous horrifying claw marks on his body.
0:16:28|0:16:45|He roared and stood up to send several black panthers flying. For a moment, the panthers dared not approach. [Yin Xiang] took the advantage, striking left and right, kicking two panthers away. Then he jumped up in place and swiftly dealt with one in front of him with a slash, before turning around to chop down the other one attempting a sneak attack from behind.
0:16:45|0:16:51|He agilely dodges the attacks of the black panther, wielding only a small dagger in his hand.
0:16:52|0:17:0|Not long after, the ground beside them was covered with the bodies of black panthers. [Chen Xiang] was so engrossed in the story that she was startled and screamed.
0:17:6|0:17:25|[Chen Xiang] covered her blushing face and ran shyly to the side. The portrait of Thirteenth Prince on the table was blown out of the window by a gust of wind. In a moment of panic, [Chen Xiang] chased after it, walking down the steps further and further away.
0:17:36|0:17:50|[Chen Xiang] chased the portrait all the way into the corridor. She stared at the portrait and jumped in place, finally firmly grasping the portrait in her hand. Before she could even be happy, her gaze was attracted by the man in luxurious clothes in the archway.
0:17:50|0:18:8|Thirteenth Prince [Yin Xiang] and Fourth Prince [Yin Xi] walked through the corridor from the archway. [Yin Xiang] smiled and turned his head, his gaze meeting the absent-minded [Chen Xiang] who was looking at him. Startled, [Chen Xiang] tried to escape but accidentally fell down.
0:18:8|0:18:14|[Yin Xiang] reached out his hand to help her, but [Chen Xiang] looked up and knew he couldn't overstep, so she quickly got up.
0:18:20|0:18:30|Fourth Prince [Yin Xi] spoke coldly, [Chen Xiang] turned pale with fright, lowering her head even more, looking extremely terrified. [Yin Xiang] couldn't bear it in his heart and helped her out.
0:18:35|0:18:40|The two princes turned and left, leaving [Chen Xiang] standing alone in place. She watched them go with the corner of her eye.
0:18:41|0:18:57|After the two of them walked away, she finally breathed a sigh of relief and couldn't help but laugh at the thought of Thirteenth Prince. She quickly took out the painting in her hand, only to find that the paper had been crumpled into a ball by herself. She returned to the previous hall.
0:19:59|0:20:13|[Liu Li] stuffed a handkerchief into [Chen Xiang]'s hand and ran away. At night, darkness spread and enveloped the entire imperial garden. Ninth Prince [Yin Xi] hurriedly passed by a rockery.
0:20:15|0:20:21|Suddenly a bucket of water was poured over him perfectly, he turned his head with a cold face to look.
0:20:36|0:20:51|[Yin Xi] remained silent. [Liu Li] stood up on her own and tentatively walked towards him, reaching out to help him with the laundry. [Yin Xi] looked down at [Liu Li] and smiled with satisfaction. [Liu Li] quickly explained.
0:20:55|0:21:8|[Yin Xi] said nothing, just smiled at her. Seeing Ninth Prince remain silent, [Liu Li] had to give up.
0:21:9|0:21:17|[Liu Li] stopped in his tracks, his eyes red with nervousness. Meanwhile, [Chen Xiang] sat at the entrance of the study room, struggling to stay awake.
0:21:18|0:21:36|In the dim candlelight, a butterfly flew past her, briefly pausing on her shoulder before flying off into the distance. [Chen Xiang] playfully followed the butterfly's lead and ran forward. After taking a few steps, she remembered something, took out a handkerchief from her pocket, and covered her face with it.
0:21:36|0:21:52|She ran and jumped all the way to a desolate palace. Wasn't this the palace she saw when she was a child? [Chen Xiang] retreated in horror, a hand patted [Chen Xiang]'s shoulder, and [Chen Xiang] screamed and ran away.
0:21:54|0:22:0|She ran into the courtyard and hid behind an incense burner, waiting until there was no movement around before slowly poking her head out.
0:22:1|0:22:6|She tiptoed out nervously, glancing around anxiously.
0:22:24|0:22:34|[Yin Xiang] paid no attention to her response, his gaze already drawn to several butterflies flying overhead. Seeing this, [Chen Xiang] lit the lamps in the courtyard.
0:22:54|0:22:59|[Chen Xiang] held a candle and shook her head in confusion, while [Yin Xiang] fell into a reverie and spoke slowly.
0:23:37|0:23:51|[Yin Xiang] recalled the scene when his mother was taken away, closing his eyes in pain. Suddenly, [Chen Xiang] took out a jar behind him and handed it mysteriously to [Yin Xiang].
0:23:51|0:24:5|[Yin Xiang] was startled, but [Chen Xiang] smiled and took out a brush to tap on the jar. [Chen Xiang] dipped the brush in the liquid inside the jar and wrote and drew on the ground. [Yin Xiang] thought [Chen Xiang] was fooling around and smiled, looking away.
0:24:5|0:24:28|Who knew a butterfly would fly in front of them, [Yin Xiang] couldn't help but widen his eyes, staring incredulously at the butterfly. The butterfly flapped its wings and slowly flew towards where [Chen Xiang] was, but she didn't notice, continuing to write with her head down. When she saw the butterfly, she wasn't surprised, just reached out and caught it, saying.
0:24:28|0:24:45|Before long, a large group of butterflies flew over from a distance. Beside him, [Yin Xiang] was stunned, his eyes shining with amazement, unable to close his mouth at the beautiful sight before him. Standing next to [Yin Xiang], [Chen Xiang] had eyes curved like crescent moons, waving at the butterflies.
0:24:45|0:24:51|The butterflies fluttered around and landed on the ground, forming the character "寿". [Yin Xiang] exclaimed in amazement.
0:24:54|0:25:2|[Chen Xiang] poked [Yin Xiang]'s mouth with a brush, and [Yin Xiang] quickly covered his mouth, suddenly realizing.
0:25:18|0:25:24|[Yin Xiang] realized that he had lost control, so he quickly let go of her, and [Chen Xiang] turned and ran away.
0:25:26|0:25:37|[Chen Xiang] was extremely shy and wanted to change the subject. She turned and ran towards the door of the palace, causing the smile on [Yin Xiang]'s face to suddenly disappear.
0:25:38|0:25:43|[Yin Xiang] remembered the girl he had seen when he was young.
0:25:44|0:25:56|[Chen Xiang] was also stunned, seeing a glimpse of [Yin Xiang]'s childhood in front of her, she involuntarily walked towards [Yin Xiang], looking into his eyes.
0:25:58|0:26:8|He wanted to remove the handkerchief covering [Chen Xiang]'s face, but [Chen Xiang] was scared by his actions and ran away. Accidentally, the handkerchief fell to the ground, and was picked up by [Yin Xiang].
0:26:10|0:26:16|[Yin Xiang] looked up, and [Chen Xiang]'s figure had already disappeared, but he had already made up his mind.
0:26:25|0:26:45|[Chen Xiang] returned to the bedroom and lay down. [Liu Li] was still awake but had her back to [Chen Xiang], ignoring her calls. In her mind, images of the intimate moments with the Ninth Prince not long ago surfaced. The two of them were in an empty hall, lying on a pavilion, their clothes all stripped off, naked and entwined together.
0:26:45|0:26:57|Liu Li's watery eyes were half-closed at this moment, feeling like she had finally made it through. Beside her, Chen Xiang remembered the encounter with the Thirteenth Prince tonight and couldn't help but smile.
0:27:8|0:27:16|In the Chu Xiu Palace, Empress De took a sip of water, and the servant beside her was holding the handkerchief that [Liu Li] used to cover [Chen Xiang]'s face on a tray.
0:27:17|0:27:24|Empress Dowager finished rinsing her mouth and continued,
0:27:47|0:27:54|Yin Xiang's expression darkened, he quickly knelt down, but remained silent, with no hint of wanting to admit his mistake on his face.
0:28:5|0:28:13|In the imperial garden, the palace maids hurried back and forth, [Liu Li] hid behind a tree with anticipation on her face, while [Yin Xi] walked over humming a tune.
0:28:51|0:29:6|[Liu Li] collapsed to the ground, grabbing onto Ninth Prince's leg as he kicked [Liu Li] away and walked away quickly. [Liu Li] walked back to the palace, tears streaming down her face.
0:29:21|0:29:27|At just one glance, [Liu Li] immediately recognized her own embroidery work, her heart stopping.
0:29:28|0:29:43|After finishing cleaning in the Ruyi Pavilion, [Chen Xiang] did not leave with everyone else. She looked around, carefully put down the broom, and with all her strength, she moved the barrier in front of the painting in the center of the hall. Underneath was the portrait of [Yin Xiang].
0:29:43|0:30:2|[Chen Xiang] looked at the person in the painting with a silly smile, and the sound of warhorses seemed to echo in his ears. Just then, someone suddenly walked in behind him, and [Chen Xiang] slowly turned around. To his surprise, the person who came in turned out to be the thirteenth prince [Yin Xiang], leaving [Chen Xiang] stunned.
0:30:2|0:30:21|[Yin Xiang] seemed to be glowing behind him, looking at [Chen Xiang] with a smile in his eyes, so gentle that it almost melted people. [Chen Xiang] stepped forward and embraced [Yin Xiang] around the waist, while [Yin Xiang] also held [Chen Xiang] around the waist. The two stood face to face, dancing in place, bathed in a warm light, their smiles overflowing.
0:30:21|0:30:29|[Chen Xiang] closed her eyes and enjoyed the moment of joy. When she opened her eyes again, the person in front of her had turned into [Chun Shou].
0:31:34|0:31:51|Upon seeing [Chen Xiang], [Liu Li]'s expression turned guilty, and she walked out from the crowd. [Chen Xiang] looked at [Liu Li] incredulously with a cold face, and [Chun Shou] beside her did the same. Back in the room, [Liu Li] knelt down in front of [Chen Xiang] with a thud.
0:32:40|0:33:10|The two embraced each other and wept bitterly. [Chen Xiang] gave up her position like this, only able to sit alone by the bed late at night, until the sky turned silver at dawn. [Liu Li] watched the servants busy for her, showing a satisfied smile.
0:33:20|0:33:27|[Liu Li], dressed up, was escorted by [Chen Xiang] to meet the Empress Dowager, but [Yin Xiang] intercepted her on the way.
0:33:36|0:33:53|[Yin Xiang] noticed something unusual about [Liu Li], a hint of surprise flickering in his eyes, but he did not suspect anything. Inside the main hall of Chuxiu Palace, [Liu Li] followed a group of concubines in a flustered manner, bowing and kneeling nervously.
0:33:59|0:34:4|[Liu Li]'s awkward and stiff movements drew laughter from the concubines, and Empress De spoke slowly.
0:34:28|0:34:39|The concubines' eyes were full of jealousy and disdain. [Liu Li] was flattered, but accidentally fell down and made a fool of herself.
0:35:5|0:35:37|The teaching aunt pressed the heavy hair accessory on [Liu Li]'s head, while [Chen Xiang] stood by, full of heartache in her eyes. In no time, [Liu Li] was dressed up as a noble lady. After looking at [Liu Li], [Chen Xiang] pushed the door open, only to find the Thirteenth Prince standing at the door. She quickly turned and left.
0:36:14|0:36:21|[Chen Xiang] just wants to escape, but [Yin Xiang] doesn't give [Chen Xiang] a chance to leave.
0:36:23|0:36:33|[Chen Xiang] reluctantly walked up to the Thirteenth Prince with her head down, and had to sit down obediently. [Yin Xiang] handed her a piece of pastry.
0:36:34|0:36:52|Seeing [Chen Xiang] hesitating, [Yin Xiang] sternly said. Only then did [Chen Xiang] take the snack and took a big bite. [Yin Xiang] looked as happy as a child.
0:36:54|0:36:57|[Yin Xiang] looked at [Chen Xiang] with anticipation on his face.
0:38:15|0:38:23|Chun Shou speaks up for Chen Xiang, who sighs but doesn't want to ask for more. The next day, Chen Xiang is taken to the horse ranch by a eunuch.
0:38:25|0:38:33|The eunuch lowered his head and said nothing, then turned and quickly walked away. But behind [Chen Xiang], the sound of horse hooves could be heard.
0:38:34|0:38:46|Chen Xiang turned around and saw Thirteenth Prince riding a horse had already arrived in front of her, and with one hand, he lifted Chen Xiang up and placed her in front of him. Chen Xiang was so scared that she screamed.
0:38:59|0:39:6|[Chen Xiang] turned and ran to the side, and [Yin Xiang] also squatted down.
0:40:6|0:40:24|[Yin Xiang] stared at [Chen Xiang] intently. [Chen Xiang] froze, while [Yin Xiang]'s face drew closer and closer, causing [Chen Xiang] to involuntarily close her eyes.
0:41:6|0:41:13|At night, [Liu Li] sat in the bathtub with her eyes closed when the door was suddenly pushed open.
0:41:46|0:41:54|[Yin Xiang] chuckled lightly and pulled out a silver token from behind.
0:42:26|0:42:43|Hearing [Yin Xi]'s description, [Liu Li] immediately understood. Not long after, [Chen Xiang] returned from the horse ranch. She ran back like a teenage girl in love, and when she entered her room, she saw [Liu Li] sitting at the table, smiling at her.
0:42:46|0:42:52|[Liu Li] stepped forward and said, placing a hand on [Chen Xiang]'s shoulder.
0:43:53|0:44:9|[Liu Li] laughed and left, [Chen Xiang] couldn't believe that [Liu Li] had changed like this, and could only cry silently while covering her mouth. In the corridor, [Yin Xiang] suddenly jumped out to play a prank.
0:44:35|0:44:46|[Liu Li] smiled lightly, feeling extremely pleased inside. The wealth and glory she desired are now all within her grasp, but all of these were taken from [Chen Xiang].
0:44:47|0:44:54|Winter arrived, and heavy snow covered the entire palace.
0:45:23|0:45:29|[Yin Xiang] is trying to mediate on the side, while [Liu Li] kneels down by the bed, looking troubled.
0:46:13|0:46:22|After Yin Xiang left, Liu Li's expression changed and she glared fiercely at Chen Xiang. That night, Yin Xi and Liu Li entwined on the bed.
0:46:24|0:46:33|[Liu Li] grabbed [Yin Xi]'s hand but was immediately pushed away.
0:46:52|0:47:9|[Chen Xiang] suddenly pushed the door open and saw [Liu Li] sitting on the bed, wearing only a bra. [Liu Li] pretended to be calm, while also trying to cover her wrist. [Yin Xi] broke through the window and [Chen Xiang] was shocked.
0:47:29|0:47:42|The next day, [Yin Xiang] suddenly received a wind chime with words on it, while on the other side, [Chen Xiang] was sitting at the table writing quickly.
0:48:36|0:48:43|After Yin Xiang walked away, Liu Li took a deep breath and gritted her teeth.
0:48:55|0:49:2|[Liu Li] turned around to look at [Chen Xiang].
0:49:16|0:49:21|[Liu Li] walked to the table, picked up the teacup, and then smashed it heavily on the ground.
0:50:6|0:50:25|[Chen Xiang] closed her eyes, trying hard to control her emotions, but her eyelashes kept trembling. When she opened her eyes again, hatred filled them, but she was powerless to resist at this moment. The winter night came fast and piercingly cold, turning the Forbidden City into a city of ice and snow glass.
0:50:25|0:50:39|[Chen Xiang] stood on the side of the road, covered in a thick layer of snow, shivering from the cold. Suddenly, there was a noise behind her, and she turned to see Yin Xiang, the thirteenth prince. She turned and ran away in a panic.
0:50:44|0:50:51|Chen Xiang's face was pale from the cold, with red eyes and tiny ice crystals forming on her eyelashes, evoking pity.
0:51:8|0:51:14|[Chen Xiang] felt like her heart was being twisted, but then she let out a sigh of relief. Just as she was about to leave, she suddenly turned around and hugged [Yin Xiang], saying,
0:51:15|0:51:35|Chen Xiang's face was pressed against Yin Xiang's warm chest, then reluctantly released. Yin Xiang lowered his head to look at Chen Xiang, who was close enough to touch, with a wave of emotion in his eyes. Chen Xiang took a step back, a bright teardrop slid down her face, and then she fled like a bird.
0:51:35|0:51:40|[Yin Xiang] stood still, feeling a strange sensation welling up in his heart.
0:51:41|0:51:48|On their wedding night, [Chen Xiang] shut out all mocking voices and turned to [Chun Shou].
0:52:44|0:52:59|[Chun Shou] cried helplessly, his face and body covered in bruises, a shocking sight. [Chen Xiang] was by his side preparing hot water for him.
0:53:5|0:53:16|[Chun Shou] cried even harder at the words. [Chen Xiang] squatted by the water basin, though she didn't say a word, she couldn't help but cover her mouth and sob, her body shaking uncontrollably.
0:53:53|0:54:2|The Emperor finally found a hint of comfort in his eyes, he stood up slowly and walked towards [Yin Xiang], raising his hand as he spoke.
0:54:10|0:54:27|The other older brothers knelt on the ground without daring to move. The Fourth Prince had a dark expression, and the Crown Prince was even more indignant. The capital was bustling during the day, with the Crown Prince walking alone in the crowd.
0:54:31|0:54:36|Complaining on one side, while throwing money into the beggar's bowl beside him.
0:54:37|0:55:2|Attracted by the nearby opera music, [Yin Xi] took off his opera costume, handed it to the old man, and bid farewell with a bow. [Yin Xiang] watched outside the door with confusion, unable to resist his curiosity and sneaked in to peek, only to be discovered by the old man coincidentally.
0:55:16|0:55:28|[Yin Xiang] looked around for a moment, poured a bag of gold ingots on the table. The old man was stunned, [Yin Xiang] stared at him and said.
0:55:51|0:56:14|As soon as the emperor finished speaking, the surroundings became noisy with the sound of gongs and drums. A group of eunuchs carrying lanterns quickly walked over from the side steps and stood in two rows. Several people in opera costumes holding flags rushed out energetically, with [Yin Xiang] standing in the middle. He was dressed as Sun Wukong and sang in a lively manner.
0:56:51|0:56:57|[Yin Xiang] knelt on the ground in confusion, until he saw the triumphant look in [Yin Xi]'s eyes beside him and realized that he had been tricked.
0:57:8|0:57:15|[Yin Xi] frowned at the words and placed the chess piece in his hand.
0:58:7|0:58:18|[Yin Xiang] was shocked when he heard the words, turned his back to the silver needle, panic filling his face. Then, as if making a decision, he suddenly turned around and said.
0:58:27|0:58:34|The night in the Yanxi Palace was eerily quiet, [Chen Xiang] stood in the courtyard lost in thought, and quickly hid when she heard footsteps approaching.
0:58:35|0:58:45|[Yin Xiang] approached the palace gate step by step but did not enter, muttering to himself with a heart full of concerns.
0:58:54|0:59:2|Late at night, [Liu Li] followed [Yin Xiang]'s instructions and hid in the dark corners of the imperial garden. She carefully moved through the bushes, afraid of being discovered by the patrolling palace guards.
0:59:58|1:0:7|After listening to Yin Xiang's words, Chen Xiang was stunned. Yin Xiang then turned around and left.
1:0:8|1:0:23|After leaving the Yanxi Palace, [Chen Xiang] walked heavily with a heavy heart along the corridor, suddenly hearing whispers. She followed the sound and stealthily arrived at the Moon Gate, looking up to see [Liu Li] and [Yin Xi].
1:0:35|1:0:39|The two turned their heads at the sound and saw the slender figure fleeing in a panic, [Liu Li] exclaimed.
1:0:42|1:0:59|[Chen Xiang] didn't hesitate at all, running frantically along the palace corridor in search of the figure of the thirteenth prince. She ran outside the palace, only to find that the thirteenth prince was no longer there. She quickly turned back and finally saw [Yin Xiang]'s figure in a corridor, without any hesitation, [Chen Xiang] chased after him.
1:1:0|1:1:10|At this moment, as Empress Yi's colorful canopy passed by, the palace maids had to step aside and bow. [Chen Xiang] retreated to the side, but her eyes were fixed firmly on the Thirteenth Prince.
1:1:11|1:1:26|However, when [Chen Xiang] caught up again, the Thirteenth Prince had already left the palace gates. [Chen Xiang] was stopped by the guards. Thinking quickly, she climbed up a nearby tall building and shouted towards the distance. A strong hand covered [Chen Xiang]'s mouth and dragged her away.
1:1:26|1:1:32|[Yin Xiang] turned his head at the sound, thinking he was hearing things, and then left.
1:1:56|1:2:10|The emperor put on a helmet and mask made of gold, while [Yin Xiang] and [Yin Xi] wore silver helmets. The father and son rode horses galloping on the hunting ground, followed by a large group of attendants. Several roe deer startled and ran past, [Yin Xiang] raised his bow and arrow and shouted.
1:2:22|1:2:32|[Yin Xi] heard the words and led a group of followers to sneak into the nearby jungle, gradually disappearing. [Yin Xiang] glanced sideways, looking at the gap beside him, feeling that this was a rare opportunity.
1:2:33|1:2:51|He pretended to be calm, secretly broke away from the team, and let the emperor chase the prey alone on horseback. Four men in black rode horses from a distance, each holding weapons and carrying quivers, rushing towards the depths of the forest. The emperor shook off his attendants, chasing the roe deer alone, completely unaware that he had fallen into a trap.
1:2:52|1:2:59|At the moment he shot the arrow, four black-clothed men had already surrounded him.
1:3:6|1:3:18|Before the words could finish, the black-clothed men around were shot down by arrows from a distance. In an instant, the soldiers ambushed around surrounded [Yin Xiang] and others, leaving no way out. The Emperor appeared among the soldiers with a cold expression on his face.
1:3:19|1:3:30|[Yin Xiang] looked at him in horror and shock, before he could react, the fake emperor in front of him shattered the mask with an arrow, and he passed out. The fake emperor who took off the mask turned out to be [Yin Xi].
1:3:41|1:3:48|[Yin Xiang] was escorted by the guards, his eyes covered and his clothes dirty.
1:4:18|1:4:36|[Yin Xi]'s face turned ugly, wanting to get angry but was helpless, allowing [Liu Li] to gloat. Seeing [Yin Xi] in a daze, [Liu Li] suddenly stepped forward and hugged him, fiercely biting his lips. [Yin Xi] struggled to push [Liu Li] away, blood already oozing from his mouth.
1:4:38|1:4:42|[Yin Xi] wiped the blood off his mouth and smiled sinisterly.
1:4:43|1:4:54|In the Yanxi Palace, the Emperor stood on the grand hall, staring blankly at the rusty golden cage in front of him. Suddenly, the image of the late Concubine Min's voice and smile appeared before his eyes.
1:5:6|1:5:24|Empress Min and her maid stood by the lake, unaware of the Emperor behind them. She simply smiled and reached out her hand, as two wrists lightly flipped, a golden dragon appeared in the night sky and spiraled upwards. The Emperor and his attendants all widened their eyes, showing fear on their faces, and were so scared that they knelt down and looked up.
1:5:54|1:6:0|The emperor endured the pain and made up his mind, the guards picked up the cold spears and stabbed into the body of [Minfei].
1:6:7|1:6:35|The Emperor's face turned pale suddenly, filled with regret. Long-buried memories were suddenly unlocked, causing the Emperor to uncontrollably shed tears again. Empress Dowager appeared quietly behind the Emperor, her eyes filled with tenderness. The Emperor looked at her, wanting to say something, but it turned into a long sigh. A bucket of ice-cold water was poured over [Chen Xiang]'s head.
1:6:48|1:6:55|[Liu Li] pushes [Chen Xiang] to the ground, glaring fiercely.
1:6:58|1:7:9|[Liu Li] crouched down, grabbing [Chen Xiang]'s collar, her eyes filled with intense hatred. She gasped, her beautiful face contorted into a grimace, reaching out to touch [Chen Xiang]'s cheek and said.
1:7:22|1:7:29|[Chen Xiang] looked up at the unfamiliar [Liu Li] with sadness in her eyes, which overshadowed her fear. The two of them arrived at the door.
1:7:38|1:7:57|In front of the gate, the long corridor was covered with burning hot charcoal, sizzling loudly. [Chen Xiang] remained calm, bending down to take off her shoes and socks, revealing her bare feet without hesitation as she stepped into the bone-chilling snow. [Liu Li] stared intently at [Chen Xiang]'s back, while the palace maids and nurses behind her stood in a row, not daring to make a sound.
1:7:58|1:8:10|[Chen Xiang] stopped in front of the charcoal fire, [Liu Li] turned her head disdainfully, thinking she wouldn't dare to approach. But then she saw [Chen Xiang] slowly lift her snow-covered foot and step onto the charcoal fire, bit by bit.
1:8:10|1:8:27|[Liu Li] only glanced over and was shocked by [Chen Xiang]'s actions, showing an incredulous expression. [Chen Xiang] painfully opened his mouth, but could only make a hoarse hissing sound, enduring the pain as he staggered forward. The attendants behind [Liu Li] all looked up at [Chen Xiang], frowning and unable to look directly at him.
1:8:28|1:8:45|[Chun Shou] stood in the distance, looking at everything with a heart full of pain and tears streaming down, but hating his own helplessness. Watching [Chen Xiang] walk to the other side of the corridor, [Liu Li] had slightly red eyes, filled with more than just hatred. [Chen Xiang] sat on the ground, his face pale.
1:8:57|1:9:13|[Chun Shou] bribed the guard of the Zongren Mansion, taking care of everything for [Chen Xiang]. In the desolate Zongren Mansion in winter, the dried branches were already covered with snow, crows cawed nearby, and [Chen Xiang] limped into the courtyard with a crippled body.
1:9:14|1:9:22|Bare feet stepped on the snow as if they had lost all sensation. She leaned against the stone pillar and took small steps forward.
1:9:23|1:9:28|Having forgotten the pain in her body, Chen Xiang's heart and eyes were filled with concern for the Thirteenth Prince.
1:9:29|1:9:43|She walked into the shop and looked around, [Yin Xiang] suddenly emerged from the shadows. [Chen Xiang] turned her head and found [Yin Xiang] lying on the bed in a state of collapse.
1:9:55|1:10:12|[Yin Xiang] stood still, although blind, his eyes were shining. He got off the bed and ran towards [Chen Xiang]. [Chen Xiang] hurriedly went forward to support the stumbling [Yin Xiang], and then he was tightly embraced by him. [Yin Xiang] caressed [Chen Xiang]'s face.
1:10:19|1:10:29|[Yin Xiang] couldn't help but hug [Chen Xiang] again.
1:10:52|1:11:12|Chen Xiang didn't know whether to be happy or sad, just nodded silently. Yin Xiang hugged her with a smile, and Chen Xiang agreed in this haphazard way, not considering the consequences, just wanting Thirteenth Prince to be happy. Back home, Chen Xiang enthusiastically started preparing various foods, wanting to bring them to Thirteenth Prince.
1:11:12|1:11:27|[Chen Xiang] has already gotten up and started to busy herself. [Chun Shou] follows behind her, drooling with hunger. [Chun Shou] picks up a piece of cabbage and puts it into her mouth.
1:11:28|1:11:38|[Chen Xiang] was anxious and hopping mad, while [Chun Shou] continued to eat leisurely.
1:11:55|1:12:3|The guards at the Zongren Mansion suddenly changed their attitude, refusing to let [Chen Xiang] in no matter what. In the scuffle, [Chen Xiang] fell in the rain, and the food in the box scattered all over the ground.
1:12:4|1:12:13|[Chen Xiang] felt heartbroken and cried in despair. Just then, a royal physician walked out from the mansion. [Chen Xiang] brightened up and quickly got up to follow.
1:12:52|1:13:9|The imperial physician led [Chen Xiang] into a dark passage, pushing open one secret door after another. In [Chen Xiang]'s resolute eyes, a hint of fear towards the unknown could not be concealed, surrounded by moving bronze walls and iron walls. The imperial physician pushed open the final door, revealing a secret chamber.
1:13:36|1:13:42|In front of them, the statue suddenly transformed into a door that slowly opened, revealing a huge pool inside.
1:13:43|1:14:2|The dragon heads on both sides of the pool kept draining water, and the liquid in the pool was extremely turbid. The imperial physician stood behind her, urging her on with a cold and indifferent expression. [Chen Xiang] tightly closed her eyes, the smile of the thirteenth prince appearing in her mind, giving her a boost.
1:14:5|1:14:13|[Liu Li] suddenly appeared at the door, walked quickly to [Chen Xiang] in front, [Chen Xiang] turned his head in confusion.
1:14:37|1:14:49|[Chen Xiang] looked at [Liu Li] with tears streaming down her face, recalling the intimate years they had spent together. Just as she was moved, she heard [Liu Li] let out a cold laugh, and saw her expression gradually contort.
1:14:50|1:15:6|Chen Xiang immediately looked down in a hurry, only to find Liu Li holding a curved knife about to stab her. To her surprise, she was not stabbed as expected, but instead struggled to float to the surface of the water. The pool was surrounded by experimental subjects that were no longer human-shaped. It turned out that everything was an illusion.
1:15:8|1:15:20|In the evening, the night market in the capital city is still bustling. A mysterious man weaves through the crowded streets. Hurried and anxious, he rushes to a table next to a food stall.
1:15:21|1:15:39|He leaned in close to [Yin Xi]'s ear and whispered something, but [Yin Xi] remained calm and continued to drink his soup. Before long, [Yin Xi] found himself in a theater with eerie puppets hanging in the room, looking very frightening. Although feeling strange, [Yin Xi] did not retreat, but carefully observed his surroundings.
1:15:40|1:15:52|Suddenly, the hat on top of his head was pulled away by an invisible force, startling [Yin Xi]. An old man appeared in the corner holding a white hat.
1:16:20|1:16:36|The surrounding puppets have started talking, creating a cacophony in the room. [Yin Xi] showed no fear and couldn't help but burst into laughter. Late at night, the tormented [Chen Xiang] finally broke free from his suffering and headed straight to the ancestral mansion. Meanwhile, [Yin Xiang] concealed himself in the darkness.
1:16:48|1:16:55|[Chen Xiang] turned around to leave, but [Yin Xiang] pulled her back.
1:17:11|1:17:26|[Chen Xiang] was extremely scared, pushing the already crazed [Yin Xiang] away, frantically adjusting her collar. Her fierce resistance seemed to pour cold water on [Yin Xiang], who turned around and knelt on the ground, sobbing in pain.
1:17:38|1:17:50|[Chen Xiang] came to her senses and saw the pitiful Thirteenth Prince looking like a trapped animal, her heart ached. She couldn't help but rush forward, bend down, and whispered softly in [Yin Xiang]'s ear.
1:17:51|1:18:6|[Yin Xiang], with red eyes, was about to lift his head when [Chen Xiang]'s warm and moist lips gently landed on his cheek. [Yin Xiang]'s breath hitched, but soon he took control of the situation. With a cry of surprise from [Chen Xiang], she was pinned down by [Yin Xiang]. As the snowstorm passed, the sky gradually brightened.
1:18:38|1:18:47|Seeing [Yin Xiang] smiling sweetly, [Yin Xi]'s expression changed. He sighed deeply and said.
1:18:49|1:18:54|Not long after, [Chen Xiang] walked into the ancestral house as usual with a food box in her arms, her smile particularly radiant.
1:19:33|1:19:38|[Yin Xiang] slowly felt his way out of the door. [Chen Xiang] wanted to explain but didn't know where to start.
1:19:49|1:19:57|[Chen Xiang] was hurt by these words and couldn't help but slap [Yin Xiang].
1:20:29|1:20:53|[Yin Xiang]'s cold and ruthless tone pierced [Chen Xiang]'s heart like a knife. She felt completely hopeless, nodding blankly. A big tear fell from her right eye as she looked up at [Yin Xiang]'s face, then quickly averted her gaze and hurriedly left as if escaping. [Yin Xiang] stood still in place. He thought he would feel relieved, but instead he couldn't help but feel heartbroken.
1:20:53|1:21:1|Night falls, the imperial physician hurriedly emerges from the Qianqing Palace, but accidentally falls to the ground, quickly gets up and runs up the stairs ahead.
1:21:4|1:21:14|[Yin Xi] was fully armed in armor, reaching out to interrupt the imperial physician's words. He turned around with a cold laugh, and the soldiers behind him immediately understood, getting ready for action.
1:21:15|1:21:20|The imperial physician was dumbfounded, too scared to move as he watched a large group of soldiers about to rush into the Qianqing Palace gates.
1:21:21|1:21:30|The army marched in a mighty manner under the leadership of the Ninth Prince, determined to seize the throne. Soon, the palace gates were successfully opened.
1:21:32|1:21:36|The soldiers behind locked the palace gate, and [Yin Xi] led a team straight to the main hall.
1:21:37|1:21:45|At this moment, the Fourth Prince [Yin Xi] is sitting in the hall, calmly playing the qin, facing danger but remaining composed, and speaking slowly.
1:22:22|1:22:34|[Yin Xi] heard this and everyone stopped in their tracks, looking at each other and dared not to move forward. The soldiers outside the palace were completely unaware of the situation inside, and in the blink of an eye, they were surrounded, causing panic.
1:23:51|1:24:6|Outside the palace, there was continuous gunfire, but no one dared to move inside. [Yin Xi] was furious and drew his sword towards [Yin Xiang], when suddenly the Emperor on the dragon throne sat up straight.
1:24:29|1:24:36|The emperor was manipulated like a puppet, with a figure swaying behind him. Before he could finish speaking, he lay down on the bed.
1:25:9|1:25:17|As soon as the words fell, the gates of Ganqing Palace slowly opened, and [Yin Xi] turned his head to realize that the situation was already lost. He closed his eyes in despair.
1:25:55|1:26:4|The lamas played their instruments and left Ganqing Palace, restoring silence in an instant.
1:26:5|1:26:26|[Yin Xi] stood under the light in front of the dragon throne, his gloomy face filled with unquestionable dignity. In the year 1722, after the death of the Qing Dynasty's Kangxi Emperor, he ordered his fourth son [Yin Xi] to succeed him, with the reign title Yongzheng. With a pair of aged hands holding the imperial seal, he pressed it at the end of the testament, marking the beginning of the new emperor's enthronement ceremony.
1:26:26|1:26:37|Following the command of the Mingzang official, Emperor [Yongzheng] walked out of the hall in a dragon robe, and the courtiers began to perform the three kneels and nine kowtows ceremony.
1:26:58|1:27:7|[Yongzheng] ascended the throne and immediately conferred the title of Prince Yi on the Thirteenth Prince. The hereditary prince,
1:27:7|1:27:25|The once desolate and bleak Zongren Mansion is now bustling with activity, filled with attendants. The imperial physician is busy administering acupuncture to [Yin Xiang] on the bed, with a sense of trepidation. The Emperor stands calmly by the side, waiting. After the treatment, the physician removes the cloth from [Yin Xiang]'s eyes, then nods to the Emperor.
1:27:25|1:27:31|[Yin Xiang] furrowed his brow, avoiding the sunlight streaming in through the window, and slowly opened his eyes.
1:27:32|1:27:40|He staggered to his feet, his vision gradually clearing from a blur to a focus, finally recognizing the person in front of him. [Yin Xiang] exclaimed.
1:27:41|1:28:8|The emperor was overjoyed, unable to contain his laughter. With everything settled, the cold winter gradually faded away, making room for the spring flowers blooming in the palace. Under the trees of Qianqing Hall, a group of palace maids were playing and laughing merrily, while [Chen Xiang] sat by the window lost in thought. [Chun Shou] hurried over to deliver a message.
1:28:38|1:28:58|[Chun Shou]'s words seemed to rub salt into [Chen Xiang]'s wound. Unwilling to listen any longer, [Chen Xiang] turned and fled. She walked onto a small bridge, only to see [Yin Xiang] in luxurious attire approaching confidently. [Chen Xiang] dared not look directly at him and quickly avoided him.
1:29:16|1:29:36|The Emperor leaned over and lifted the chin of [Liu Li], his eyes becoming even colder. [Liu Li] trembled in fear and spoke. The Emperor couldn't help but sneer. He turned and left, leaving [Liu Li] alone kneeling in the side hall, with eyes wide open filled with fear.
1:29:36|1:29:49|[Liu Li] knew that there was no hope left and wanted to escape from the palace. She mingled with the group leaving the palace, but the guards behind her were very alert.
1:29:59|1:30:7|Yin Xiang's expression was complex. After dismissing the guards, he looked at Liu Li kneeling on the ground. Liu Li remained silent, showing no fear.
1:30:25|1:30:32|[Yin Xiang] thought she was just sulking, and lowered her head to endure it as much as possible, saying,
1:31:6|1:31:21|At this moment, [Liu Li] disregarded everything, even if it meant sacrificing everything to ensure others' safety. [Yin Xiang]'s fingers slowly loosened, despite being furious, there was nothing he could do.
1:31:34|1:31:41|Liu Li's face was covered with tears, suddenly turned to look at Yin Xiang, and put on a charming smile.
1:32:5|1:32:12|[Liu Li] pushed [Yin Xiang] away with all her strength, laughed triumphantly, and then turned around to jump onto the horse.
1:32:12|1:32:29|Despite the fierce smile, [Liu Li] still had tears of unwillingness in her eyes. She rode wildly, with the outside world within reach. Suddenly, the city tower was filled with imperial guards, arrows were shot simultaneously, and in an instant, [Liu Li] was turned into a hedgehog, the light in her eyes disappearing instantly.
1:32:29|1:32:50|She fell heavily from the horse and landed on the ground. Beside her, [Yin Xiang] was shocked and turned around to see the Emperor standing on the city tower, indifferent to the front. [Yin Xiang] ran up and helped the bloodied [Liu Li] up from the ground, as [Liu Li] coughed up blood with weak breath.
1:32:51|1:33:11|As soon as the words fell, [Liu Li]'s strength was drained away, but her big eyes remained wide open. Despite all the calculations, in the end, she lost everyone's trust and even sacrificed her life. This was the brief life of [Liu Li]. At night, the flames flickered in the corner at the end of the corridor.
1:33:26|1:33:32|[Chen Xiang] puts the paper money into the incense burner, and [Chun Shou] suddenly exclaims as he looks at the distant sky.
1:33:34|1:33:50|[Chen Xiang] was startled, quickly turned his head but was attracted by something floating in the night sky. The two of them forgot about burning the paper money, and followed it all the way to the base of the wall, looking up to see a sky lantern slowly flying up into the sky.
1:33:50|1:34:6|In the imperial garden, [Yin Xiang] stood by the lake as several palace maids busily released one sky lantern after another into the sky. Each lantern was adorned with a piece of writing, creating a scene where the lights in the sky reflected on the water surface.
1:34:35|1:34:49|[Chen Xiang] had a hint of a smile in her eyes, and hope reignited in her heart. She turned and ran off, leaving [Chun Shou] standing there with a desolate look. Determined, [Chen Xiang] decided to be brave and returned to her room to start grooming herself.
1:34:58|1:35:25|[Chen Xiang] put the single earring into the box, took a deep breath nervously. She touched the hair accessory on her head, looking radiant, with a shy and hopeful expression of a young girl in love. [Chun Shou] reached out to help her tidy her hair, with gentle eyes, genuinely happy for her. Outside the door stood four palace maids, holding lamps in their hands.
1:35:27|1:35:35|[Chen Xiang] froze, nervously swallowed, hesitant to ask more questions. She arrived at Qianqing Palace, knelt down anxiously,
1:37:10|1:37:25|The Emperor turned and left, [Chen Xiang] knelt in the hall, her delicate body trembling slightly, tears silently falling to the ground.
1:37:48|1:37:59|In the imperial garden, [Yin Xiang] clasped his hands together in prayer, eagerly anticipating the reunion with his beloved.
1:38:2|1:38:7|Chen Xiang's heart seemed to be tortured inch by inch, and the silent tears gradually turned into loud wailing.
1:38:8|1:38:24|She bit her lip tightly, tears streaming down her face, soaking her cheeks. Thinking back to that night at the Zongren Mansion, the two of them huddled closely together, the warmth of that moment seemed to be right in front of her, but now it was gradually becoming out of reach with Chen Xiang's tears.
1:38:24|1:38:40|The long night has passed, and as the dawn breaks into the hall, [Chen Xiang]'s tears have dried up, leaving her eyes devoid of any color. At this moment, [Yin Xiang] still maintains the gesture of clasping his hands together, but the hope in his eyes is slowly fading away.
1:39:33|1:39:42|[Chen Xiang] nodded and lowered her eyes, no longer speaking. [Chen Xiang] distributed the gold to everyone.
1:39:52|1:39:57|When the aunt arrived, everyone scattered in a panic, leaving only a dozen gold ingots in [Chen Xiang]'s hands.
1:40:0|1:40:18|Aunt refused to accept the gold ingot from [Chen Xiang], a few words made [Chen Xiang] tearful eyes smile and nod. Aunt, as usual, was serious and indifferent, but her eyes turned red as she walked away. [Chen Xiang] turned his head and went to [Chun Shou]'s side.
1:40:48|1:40:55|Chen Xiang is still unable to let go of the relationship with Yin Xiang, which is entangled by fate.
1:40:56|1:41:8|In the late night at the Zongren Mansion, it was dark, cold, and eerie, with only a faint moonlight shining into the courtyard. [Chen Xiang] changed into commoner's clothes and quietly entered with a dim lantern in hand.
1:41:9|1:41:15|She stepped into the room where [Yin Xiang] had lived, looking around at the furnishings that were almost identical to those in her memories.
1:41:16|1:41:25|The dust-covered memories were gradually opened up as far as the eye could see, and the once shared happy times were now vividly displayed like a dream.
1:41:57|1:42:4|Walking through the deep palace, each and every thing that happened along the way flooded her mind, causing her immense heartache.
1:42:4|1:42:23|At this moment, a familiar voice suddenly came from behind. [Chen Xiang] trembled, almost dropping the lantern in his hand. He turned around and looked towards the figure that was faintly visible in the darkness. It was only then that [Chen Xiang] realized it was not an illusion and asked, "Who's there?"
1:42:46|1:42:59|[Yin Xiang]'s heartfelt confession fell into [Chen Xiang]'s ears, turning into strings of tears sliding down her face. However, she became timid once again, dropping the lantern and running towards the door, with the sole intention of escaping.
1:43:0|1:43:6|[Yin Xiang] took [Chen Xiang] into his arms before tearing off the cloth in front of him.
1:43:38|1:43:45|Chen Xiang, despite being nervous, was charmed by Yin Xiang's gentleness and couldn't help but smile shyly, as Yin Xiang asked.
1:43:48|1:44:5|In the blink of an eye, the two held hands tightly, passed through the archway, and walked through the corridor. [Yin Xiang] pulled [Chen Xiang] and ran forward, with a childlike smile on his face, occasionally looking back at her affectionately. [Chen Xiang] smiled brightly, her eyes fixed on [Yin Xiang], unwilling to look away.
1:44:5|1:44:13|Before long, the two arrived at the entrance of the Yanxi Palace, with [Yin Xiang] continuing to speak with a smile.
