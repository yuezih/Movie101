0:1:17|0:1:32|[Zhao Xiaoxin] saw a tomato on his way home from school. He observed it with a magnifying glass for a while, but couldn't resist picking it up in the end. Then he looked ahead in the alley, found no one there, turned around to look at the end of the alley, and saw no one on the street.
0:1:32|0:1:38|With a greedy heart, [Zhao Xiaoxin] hesitated for a moment, then ate the tomatoes he had picked up and walked home briskly.
0:1:39|0:1:52|After a while, he suddenly slowed down his pace, [Village Chief Si Lun] walked with a wheeze. He bent over, hugging his stomach with both hands, and slowly walked towards home. But after only a few steps, he knelt down on the ground.
0:1:52|0:2:5|He pressed his abdomen against his thighs with his body, trying to alleviate the severe pain in his stomach, but it didn't work. Eventually, he fell to the ground on his side and never woke up again.
0:2:11|0:2:22|[Zhao Xiaoxin]'s father [Zhao Qiquan] and uncle [Zhao Deyi], one carrying a wood-cutting knife and the other carrying a kitchen knife, were filled with anger as they searched everywhere for the person who poisoned and killed their nephew, but had nowhere to vent their rage.
0:2:51|0:3:8|Grandpa, with a worried look on his face, covers his grandson's coffin board. Father [Zhao Qiquan] and uncle [Zhao Deyi], one with a cigarette in his mouth and the other holding a cigarette, look despondent. With this unexpected event, the story of the Niangniang Temple slowly unfolds, and the story begins.
0:3:46|0:4:2|Blind [Er Sao] stood with a hanging pot, straightened his back, held the strings with his left hand, and pushed and pulled the bow in and out with his right hand, singing loudly the Henan opera. The villagers sat crowded around the Niangniang Temple Primary School, with thousands of eyes focused on the blind [Er Sao].
0:4:2|0:4:8|To celebrate the fact that there is a cure for the fever, the villagers were very happy and eagerly listened to the song played by [Er Sao].
0:4:9|0:4:18|The playground was crowded, with people sitting on the school's courtyard wall. Blind [Er Sao] was clapping his hands, shaking his head, and tapping his feet on the willow wood door panel in rhythm.
0:4:24|0:4:40|Blind [Er Sao]'s passionate singing quickly stirred up the emotions of the villagers, turning the quiet scene into a lively one. The villagers applauded and cheered, fueling [Er Sao] to sing even more passionately and energetically. [Zhao Deyi] also managed to detach himself from the sadness of losing his nephew.
0:4:40|0:4:55|Suddenly, a commotion in the distance caught his attention. Holding a horn, [Big Mouth] was confronting [Grain House Aunt]. The sound of the horn almost drowned out the singing of [Er Sao], as [Grain House Aunt] pointed towards [Zhao Qiquan] not far away.
0:5:25|0:5:41|[Village Chief Si Lun] stood coldly for a while, then walked around the crowd towards [Zhao Qiquan]. Seeing this, the villagers followed [Village Chief Si Lun] and surrounded [Zhao Qiquan]. Holding a toothpick in his mouth, [Zhao Qiquan] was stunned in place for a moment.
0:5:41|0:5:44|[Village Chief Si Lun] hunched over, gritting his teeth as he spoke to [Zhao Qiquan].
0:5:50|0:6:7|[Zhao Qiquan] scanned the villagers and was about to turn around and leave when he was pushed to the ground by [Village Chief Si Lun]. [Zhao Qiquan] grabbed his hair randomly and got up from the ground.
0:6:24|0:6:36|[Zhao Qiquan] insisted on not kneeling down, and he fought with [Village Chief Si Lun]. The villagers took a step back when they saw this. Then, the scene flashed back to [Zhao Qiquan] burying blood, showing the villagers selling blood.
0:6:36|0:6:42|[Lao Zhuzhu] was furious, bit hard on [Zhao Qiquan]'s ear, and then fell off his back.
0:6:59|0:7:6|[Zhao Qiquan] glanced at the villagers, grabbed his crying daughter, covered his bleeding ear, and walked out of the Niangniang Temple Primary School.
0:7:23|0:7:26|[Old Lump] kneels on the ground and kowtows to the villagers.
0:8:39|0:8:53|With the words just spoken by [Village Chief Si Lun], there was a sudden thud behind him, like the sound of a piece of wood falling. Upon closer inspection, the blind [Er Sao], who had just been performing passionately, had fallen and died. Upon seeing this, the villagers scattered.
0:8:53|0:9:3|[Grain House Aunt] stood up and walked through the crowd to the blind [Er Sao]. His eyes were bleeding, his face tense, but his upper body remained in a state of playing music.
0:9:12|0:9:15|Winter came in the blink of an eye, and the scene returned to Niangniang Temple Primary School.
0:9:28|0:9:44|People with fever came to the school sporadically, some brought wooden boards from who knows where, some combined classes on Monday to make simple beds. Seeing that the villagers with fever all moved to the Niangniang Temple Primary School, [Zhao Deyi] also decided to go to the school. One night, he started packing his bags.
0:9:49|0:10:7|After tidying up, he looked at his sleeping son, then walked up to his wife, [Hao Yan]. [Hao Yan] was sitting, curling her hair, and putting on the bracelet and necklace from the jewelry box. When she saw her husband, [Zhao Deyi], in the mirror, a hint of embarrassment crossed [Hao Yan]'s face, and her hand, which was playing with the necklace, froze in mid-air.
0:10:7|0:10:16|[Zhao Deyi] was a bit at a loss, he grabbed his messy hair in front of the mirror for a few times before speaking to [Hao Yan].
0:10:27|0:10:42|Upon hearing [Zhao Deyi]'s words, tears welled up in [Hao Yan]'s eyes, her lips trembling uncontrollably as she lowered her head to avoid her husband's gaze. The next morning, [Zhao Deyi] and his wife [Hao Yan] arrived at the Niangniang Temple Primary School with their luggage.
0:10:42|0:10:47|Hao Yan followed behind [Zhao Deyi], keeping a distance from her, looking at the school environment.
0:12:40|0:12:44|Amidst the lively chatter, the communal meal meeting came to an end.
0:12:45|0:12:56|The next day, both sides cooked a meal, and everyone from the school came to eat. People gathered in groups of three or four, eating their food quietly. [Zhao Deyi] held a bowl of soup and a corn steamed bun in his hand.
0:13:2|0:13:7|[Zhao Deyi] did not sit with others to eat, but instead looked towards the school gate while holding a bowl.
0:13:10|0:13:14|After dinner, he lay on the bed, tossing and turning restlessly.
0:13:52|0:14:10|At this moment, a sound of metal hitting outside the window was heard. [Zhao Deyi] sat up in bed upon hearing the sound, craned his neck to look outside, only to see his cousin [Zhao Xiaohai] carrying a bag and a lady's handbag. After throwing down the luggage upon opening the school gate, he clapped his hands, then turned and left.
0:14:12|0:14:23|[Zhao Deyi] stared blankly at the school gate. After his cousin [Zhao Xiaohai] left, his wife [Shang Qinqin] walked in from outside the gate. [Shang Qinqin] was wearing a bright satin cotton padded jacket and carrying a heavy suitcase.
0:14:25|0:14:39|Inside the house, [Zhao Deyi] raised himself higher with his arms after watching carefully [Shang Qinqin]'s every move. [Shang Qinqin] picked up the luggage that [Zhao Xiaohai] had thrown on the ground, shook off the dust, and walked into the school.
0:14:39|0:14:45|The men and women in the big house were all like [Zhao Deyi], with their heads propped up, leaning against the window and looking outside.
0:14:46|0:15:4|Zhang Qingqing stood in the cold wind, enduring the humiliation, the cold wind messing up her hair. She looked around the school environment, took a few steps, then lowered her head to quietly wipe away the tears. Strands of hair mixed with tears stuck to her cold and beautiful face, making her look exceptionally cold and charming.
0:15:4|0:15:11|Inside the house, [Zhao Deyi] looked at Zhang Qingqing in the cold wind, her appearance both beautiful and clean, and his heart felt as messy as her hair.
0:15:15|0:15:33|The next morning at breakfast time, [Zhao Deyi] held a large porcelain bowl in one hand, with an unopened cornmeal steamed bun inside. In the other hand, he held a piece of chalk, swaying as he walked to the entrance of the cave dwelling and drew a Chinese character. His wife [Hao Yan] hadn't visited him for seventeen days.
0:15:33|0:15:36|[Grain House Aunt] and [Shang Qinqin] were holding a basin of dirty water as they witnessed this scene.
0:16:9|0:16:16|That day, something happened at the school. [Village Chief Si Lun] led a group of people and walked quickly to the kitchen to investigate.
0:16:17|0:16:30|Old [Zhu Zhu] opened the gift cabinet and looked carefully at every corner of the room, still not satisfied with the results. Shang [Qinqin] stood in the courtyard wearing a thin sweater, and [Zhao Deyi] approached him and said.
0:16:39|0:16:52|After speaking, [Zhao Deyi] took off his coat. Without hesitation, he dodged to the side as if avoiding danger, refusing to accept [Zhao Deyi]'s coat. He could only put his own coat back on.
0:17:32|0:17:59|Seeing that Old [Zhu Zhu] did not respond to him, [Zhao Deyi] lay flat on his back, taking a deep breath. Still hearing no sound from Old [Zhu Zhu]'s side, [Zhao Deyi] then lifted the covers and got out of bed.
0:18:4|0:18:25|[Zhao Deyi] walked out of the house in his cotton coat and moved around in the spacious campus for a while. He saw the wooden ladder by the wall. After hesitating for a moment, he climbed up the ladder, feeling that the roof was an excellent vantage point. Just as [Zhao Deyi] reached the roof, he suddenly saw something in the distance.
0:18:39|0:18:53|[Zhao Deyi] smiled, rubbing his hands as he walked towards [Shang Qinqin], then sat beside her. The moonlight was bright, revealing the wild cats running in the school yard and the friction sound of cats chasing mice.
0:18:59|0:19:5|Upon hearing Shang Qinqin's response, Zhao Deyi lowered his head and chuckled for a while, then turned and asked again.
0:20:33|0:20:37|Shang Qinqin looked at the ground and said slowly and gently.
0:20:50|0:21:8|Upon hearing this, Shang Qinqin blushed and smiled. Faced with the person in front of him who was smiling like a flower at night, Zhao Deyi's thoughts became even more unsettled. He took off his coat and covered Shang Qinqin with it, this time he did not refuse. Zhao Deyi stared at Shang Qinqin and boldly spoke.
0:21:26|0:21:43|Saying that, [Zhao Deyi] immediately hugged Shang Qinqin. At this moment, a noise came from downstairs, [Zhao Deyi] quickly stopped and leaned over to look downstairs. Seeing Village Chief Si Lun sleepwalking, [Zhao Deyi] became even more reckless, he hugged Shang Qinqin from behind.
0:21:49|0:22:14|But his hand slipped into [Shang Qinqin]'s sweater. At first, [Shang Qinqin] resisted, but eventually, she went limp in [Zhao Deyi]'s arms. Early in the morning, [Village Chief Si Lun] arrived at the old residence.
0:22:53|0:22:57|Saying that, [Zhao Deyi] rushed into the room.
0:23:6|0:23:29|The men began to search the women's room in a mess, not even sparing the shoes. When Grain House Aunt searched her own bed, she found the pillow to be heavy, so she leaned in to smell it. Upon opening the pillow, she found a hemp rope tied next to it, so she untied it. As soon as she untied it, rice poured out from inside.
0:23:47|0:24:1|When Grain House Aunt refused to admit it, someone threw a pillow. Grain House Aunt held the pillow tightly to her chest on the ground and said with a sense of grievance.
0:24:30|0:24:50|After venting her emotions, [Grain House Aunt] knelt on the ground, picking up the fallen rice and putting it into a pillowcase. As she picked, she cried in grievance, and everyone inside and outside the house remained silent. While she continued to cry, the damaged cotton-padded jacket was found by [Big Mouth].
0:24:50|0:24:58|[Village Chief Si Lun] walked out of the kitchen, [Grain House Aunt] lowered her head. [Grain House Aunt] squatted on the ground, silent.
0:25:0|0:25:12|Village Chief Si Lun's notebook still had no news, and things just passed like that. One day, Shang Qinqin, wearing a lost cotton coat, sneaked out of the house and bumped into Grain House Aunt.
0:25:34|0:25:50|[Grain House Aunt] hadn't finished speaking in a stuttering manner, but [Shang Qinqin] ran away in fear. Meanwhile, [Zhao Deyi] was lying on the straw he had laid out in the abandoned kiln filled with debris. Suddenly, someone opened the door of the kiln.
0:26:6|0:26:20|[Village Chief Si Lun] rummaged through the boxes inside, while [Zhao Deyi] cowered in a dark corner, too afraid to make a sound. [Shang Qinqin] avoided [Grain House Aunt] and made her way to the entrance of the cave. Seeing no one around, she walked in. [Village Chief Si Lun] continued rummaging through the boxes.
0:26:20|0:26:33|[Shang Qinqin] saw [Village Chief Si Lun], her smile froze on her face, and [Zhao Deyi] in the corner also stood still. However, [Village Chief Si Lun] didn't care at all, still buried in his own notebook, flipping through the miscellaneous items in the cave.
0:26:37|0:26:58|Unable to find his notebook, [Village Chief Si Lun] grumbled and left. Shang Qinqin kept her body turned to the side the whole time, not daring to look at [Village Chief Si Lun]. After [Village Chief Si Lun] left, she quickly closed the door of the cave. It was time for dinner.
0:27:3|0:27:14|[Zhao Deyi] carried a bowl and a millstone, shouting for [Village Chief Si Lun] as he walked into the house. [Village Chief Si Lun] was lying on the bed with his head covered.
0:27:18|0:27:30|[Zhao Deyi] put the magic in the bowl, lifted the blanket, [Village Chief Si Lun] opened his eyes and remained motionless. Next to the board hanging on the ground, there was an old photo of [Village Chief Si Lun] in military uniform when he was young.
0:27:30|0:27:39|[Zhao Deyi] glanced at [Village Chief Si Lun] again, who was still staring blankly without moving. Then he walked out of the room with a bowl in hand, took slow steps and sat down next to [Shang Qinqin].
0:27:53|0:28:6|On the side, [Lao Zhuzhu] froze upon hearing it, [Shang Qinqin] also stopped eating, and next to them, [Zhao Deyi], after coming to his senses, buried his head and stuffed the steamed buns into his mouth, while the gloomy sky started to snow.
0:28:33|0:28:36|[Zhao Deyi] had just finished speaking when the door was pushed open.
0:28:49|0:29:8|[Zhao Qiquan] wearing a leather jacket, dragged in a large cardboard box. After his wife handed the gift to [Hao Yan], he turned off the TV. Several people in the room were unpacking the box. He moved left and right a few times, took out a bottle of liquor from his jacket pocket, lowered his head and handed it to [Grain House Aunt] sitting on the edge of the bed.
0:29:8|0:29:16|Before [Grain House Aunt] could take over, [Zhao Qiquan] directly placed the wine in front of [Grain House Aunt], then turned around and, along with the people inside the house, moved out a new television from the cardboard box.
0:29:18|0:29:41|After tidying up, the whole family came to the courtyard to prepare for setting off firecrackers. [Zhao Deyi] tried to light them with a lighter, but the cold wind blew them out. He turned around, shielding the wind with his body, and successfully lit the firecrackers.
0:29:45|0:29:58|The firecrackers exploded rapidly before they could be taken out of the house. [Shang Qinqin] was scared, as the firecrackers crackled and popped inside the house. The female liaison station had the most dance teams on the internet, and helplessly watched this scene.
0:30:0|0:30:17|After the Chinese New Year, the heavy snow melted away, winter gave way to spring, and the sky was no longer a dull gray. The weather gradually cleared up, the sky transformed from its previous gloominess to a cloudless expanse. The sick villagers sat scattered at the entrance of the alley, basking in the sun, chatting about everyday life.
0:30:21|0:30:35|Zhao Deyi squatted on the ground, swaying his body, his eyes dodging around, but eventually landed on Shang Qinqin. Shang Qinqin was entangled in a ball of yarn when suddenly, a shout rang out in the crowd.
0:30:35|0:30:43|Zhao Deyi hunched his back, swung his arms, imitating a gorilla. The people around, including [Shang Qinqin], burst into laughter.
0:30:48|0:31:4|The tofu-selling lady walked out of the alley and saw the group of patients at the village entrance running away. A young man from the village walked past them, avoiding them as if he had seen a plague god, and in the process, the cigarette hanging from his ear fell off.
0:31:6|0:31:15|Zhao Deyi picked up the cigarette that had fallen at his feet and kindly handed it to the young man. Upon seeing this, the young man refused the cigarette and simply stepped back.
0:31:16|0:31:26|Zhao Deyi took two more steps forward, and the young man turned around directly, running away in a panic. Those who were suffering from heatstroke watching this scene felt a mix of emotions. Zhao Deyi said.
0:31:28|0:31:30|Grain House Aunt frowned and said.
0:31:37|0:31:40|The surrounding villagers echoed [Grain House Aunt]'s words one after another.
0:31:42|0:31:48|[Zhao Deyi] smirked, while [Shang Qinqin] hesitated, [Grain House Aunt] cleared her throat and spoke out.
0:31:53|0:32:7|[Shang Qinqin] lowered her head and smiled lightly, then walked towards the direction of the school with [Zhao Deyi]. Leaving the village, [Zhao Deyi] looked back, then looked ahead, seeing no one around, he walked side by side with [Shang Qinqin].
0:32:8|0:32:17|[Shang Qinqin] tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, hands in the pockets of her cotton jacket, avoiding the fiery gaze of [Zhao Deyi], and spoke hesitantly.
0:32:22|0:32:28|[Shang Qinqin] looked up at [Zhao Deyi], then glanced at the grass on the ground.
0:32:43|0:32:56|[Zhao Deyi] hugged [Zhao Xiaohai] and ran towards the distant deserted field. [Zhao Deyi] hugged [Zhao Xiaohai] and ran towards the distant deserted field. [Zhao Deyi] hugged [Zhao Xiaohai] and ran towards the distant deserted field.
0:32:56|0:33:6|Zhao Deyi hugged Shang Qinqin and ran towards the distant deserted field.
0:33:13|0:33:31|After their bodies pressed together, the spark of interest quickly turned into a raging fire. After a passionate encounter, [Zhao Deyi] was ecstatic, holding hands with [Shang Qinqin] as they ran along the path, then climbed high stairs to reach the railway tracks.
0:33:31|0:33:37|A train is speeding along the tracks, and when Shang Qinqin sees it, she grabs Zhao Deyi and pulls him to the side.
0:33:51|0:33:58|Racing against the oncoming train. Shang Qinqin shouted until her voice went hoarse, with no regard for anything but running fast on the tracks.
0:34:13|0:34:20|[Zhao Deyi] is still calm and composed, facing the train moving backwards, he even takes out a cigarette from his pocket and puts it in his mouth.
0:34:21|0:34:34|The train driver saw his determination and increased the speed. Zhao Deyi then became nervous, turned around, swung his arms, and ran frantically. In a short while, the train passed over him, and he was no longer visible.
0:34:40|0:34:50|The train carriages passed by one by one, but he still didn't see Zhao Deyi's figure, so he couldn't help but cry. Zhao Deyi stood up panting heavily from a distance.
0:35:19|0:35:29|After a few days, everyone brought food to the school. Big Mouth held a megaphone urging Village Chief Si Lun to open the door, and Village Chief Si Lun happily opened the iron gate.
0:35:32|0:35:45|Outside the school gate, the patients standing there burst into laughter. In front of the gate, there were piles of flour, vegetables brought by various families, and a few chickens and ducks. Everyone worked continuously, tidying up what needed to be tidied.
0:35:45|0:35:54|[Grain House Aunt] carried bags of flour and grain into the kitchen. A lump of a pig smelled the food, drooled, and ran to the middle of the playground, spinning around the food.
0:36:17|0:36:25|Zhao Qiquan pushed a bicycle with several bags of flour on the back seat. As soon as he entered the school gate, without stopping the bike, he threw the flour on the ground.
0:36:29|0:36:53|[Zhao Qiquan] walked out of the school, parked his bicycle at the entrance, and took out a bottle of paint from his pocket. After shaking it a few times, he sprayed it on the stone wall next to the school gate. People with heatstroke stretched their necks to watch [Zhao Qiquan]. He wrote "For Sale" on the wall, along with a phone number.
0:36:58|0:37:9|After finishing talking to the people at the school, [Zhao Qiquan] got on his bicycle and left. That night, [Zhao Deyi] lay in bed and turned to ask Grain House Aunt.
0:37:24|0:37:42|[Zhao Deyi] got up, put on his coat, turned off the TV with no signal, glanced at the old Zhu Zhu, and then walked out of the room. Instead of going to the outhouse, he went to the abandoned cave. After a passionate encounter with [Shang Qinqin], the two of them put on their clothes separately.
0:38:1|0:38:21|Saying that, [Zhao Deyi] approached and unbuttoned the buttons on [Shang Qinqin]'s chest. After making eye contact with [Shang Qinqin], he completely unbuttoned them. After a moment of eye contact, [Zhao Deyi] held [Shang Qinqin] steady and the two of them stuck together again.
0:38:21|0:38:24|After the torment of the ear disease, there was immediately a period of ups and downs.
0:38:25|0:38:33|After a night, [Zhao Deyi] got up to leave the cave, but found a lock on the door that wasn't there before, with the sick people from the school gathered outside.
0:38:55|0:38:57|After speaking, [Grain House Aunt] picked up a hammer and smashed it towards the lock.
0:39:18|0:39:42|Upon hearing that [Zhao Xiaohai] had arrived, everyone stopped in their tracks. [Zhao Xiaohai] unlocked the iron gate and tossed out a bunch of keys, prompting [Village Chief Si Lun] to step forward. Expressionless, [Zhao Xiaohai] presented a key to [Village Chief Si Lun]. Upon seeing it, [Village Chief Si Lun] seemed to understand something and did not offer any further resistance.
0:39:42|0:39:44|Everyone looked into the kiln.
0:40:4|0:40:6|Shang Qinqin was dragged out by Zhao Xiaohai.
0:40:13|0:40:20|[Zhao Xiaohai] cursed as he hung the shoes that hurt Qin Qing around his neck, then dragged Qin Qing outside the school.
0:40:36|0:40:56|In the courtyard, the feverish patients stood still, watching as [Zhao Xiaohai] dragged the injured Qin Qing away. After the sound faded, [Zhao Deyi] finally emerged from the kiln. He was dressed neatly, like a child who had made a mistake, with his head down and hunched back. Everyone turned to look at him, then glanced at [Village Chief Si Lun].
0:40:56|0:40:59|[Zhao Deyi] smiled with a thick skin.
0:41:23|0:41:28|[Zhao Deyi] thought about his son not returning [Lao Zhuzhu]'s words, turned over, pulled up the blanket and went to sleep with his head covered.
0:41:29|0:41:48|[Lao Zhuzhu] wearing a coat, sat next to Kang Yan and watched him. Early in the morning, just as the sky was getting light, [Lao Gedada] and [Weasel] arrived in front of [Lao Zhuzhu]'s main house. Instead of knocking directly on the door, the two of them pressed their ears against the wall. When they didn't hear any sound, they then climbed up to the window and peeked inside.
0:41:48|0:41:56|[Grain House Aunt] poured a pot of wine and witnessed this scene.
0:42:4|0:42:9|Two people supported [Lao Zhuzhu] on both sides and walked to the side, while [Lao Gedada] spoke directly.
0:42:14|0:42:17|He also wanted to show off, but [Zhao Qiquan] stopped him.
0:42:33|0:42:36|At mealtime, [Lao Zhuzhu] revealed the purpose of the two men coming to him.
0:42:44|0:42:46|From now on, they will take care of the affairs in the school.
0:42:48|0:43:2|Just as the words were spoken, [Weasel] was seen holding a notice on his chest, while [Grain House Aunt] carried a bowl of porridge and walked out from behind the crowd. The two of them didn't speak, just solemnly pasted the paper on their faces. After pasting it, the people in the courtyard all gathered around.
0:43:14|0:43:26|Before Er could finish the third point, everyone was already drawn in by what was being said through [Big Mouth]'s loudspeaker.
0:43:43|0:44:11|The person reading the notice ran over and snatched the horn from [Big Mouth]. The matter and rules were thus settled. After dinner, [Weasel] and [Grain House Aunt] mobilized the people from the school to load the school desks and benches onto [Village Chief Si Lun]'s cart. [Er Sao] heard the noise and stopped [Village Chief Si Lun].
0:44:12|0:44:21|[Grain House Aunt] ignored everything and walked towards the school gate on [Village Chief Si Lun]'s tricycle. [Big Mouth] stepped forward and closed the school iron gate.
0:44:46|0:44:56|[Lao Zhuzhu] said nothing, just leaning against the iron gate. [Lao Gedada] took out a crumpled piece of paper from the pocket of his jacket.
0:45:0|0:45:8|Lying on the signal pot, writing down five words on the paper, "Expel [Zhao Lianzhu]". Then angrily picking up the paper, saying to [Lao Zhuzhu],
0:45:12|0:45:14|Old [Zhu Zhu] stood still without moving.
0:45:40|0:45:43|Upon hearing these words, old [Gedda]'s spine instantly collapsed.
0:45:47|0:46:6|[Weasel] grinned and used his body to push aside Old [Lump], opening the iron gate of the school. Old [Lump] could only watch as this group of people carried tables and chairs out of the school, and as [Old Lump] and others emptied the school of blackboards, miscellaneous items, and more, he remained silent, just hunching his back and standing there blankly.
0:46:6|0:46:13|Until the evening, old [Gedat] still couldn't relax. He sat on the kang, holding his head, with a lingering look of worry on his forehead.
0:46:15|0:46:33|[Zhao Deyi] filled the jar with water. When old [Zhuzhu] came to his senses and saw the jar, he carried it over. Seeing his father's furrowed brow, [Zhao Deyi] gently punched old [Zhuzhu] on the back with his fist. The water in the cup couldn't help but sway, and old [Zhuzhu] shrugged his shoulders.
0:46:33|0:46:37|Indicate [Zhao Deyi] to stop, [Zhao Deyi] sits by the fire.
0:46:41|0:46:58|Zhao Deyi thought for a moment and decided to go home. When he arrived at the door, he walked quickly into the courtyard. The washbasin was askew on the steps, the basin stand was also on the ground, and there was no light inside the house. Zhao Deyi looked inside and pushed open the door, pulling the light cord.
0:46:58|0:47:8|Glancing around, he opened the wardrobe door, only to find a few pieces of his clothes inside. He hurriedly reached into the cabinet and pulled out a box, which turned out to be empty when opened.
0:47:25|0:47:36|So, Qingqing was driven back to her mother's home by her husband and child. In the blink of an eye, the school was empty again, leaving only Grandpa alone.
0:47:39|0:47:49|Zhao Deyi went to the school to find the old resident. The old resident then went to his son's house.
0:48:19|0:48:22|Grandfather [Zhu Zhu] looked at the painting drawn by his granddaughter without saying much.
0:48:32|0:48:56|Late at night, a large tree fell in the village. A motorized three-wheeler drove along the village's small road, carrying the stump of the fallen tree, a lame man, and [Weasel]. After getting off the vehicle, they entered an empty house where a mysterious object covered by a piece of cloth was placed in the center of the room.
0:48:56|0:49:0|The cripple looked around, made sure there was no one around, and then glanced at [Weasel].
0:49:2|0:49:22|[Weasel] was unaware of the truth, following him around and peeking curiously, then following him into that mysterious treasure. He stared straight at it, trying to see through the cloth to see what was inside. The cripple lifted the cloth covering it, revealing a luxurious coffin in front of him.
0:49:22|0:49:28|[Weasel] stared straight ahead, patting the coffin with his hands, carefully examining the patterns on the coffin.
0:49:31|0:49:39|Suddenly, the coffin lid rose up, leaving the two of them stunned. When it reached a certain height, [Zhao Qiquan] nearby turned off the mechanism in his hand.
0:49:43|0:49:49|[Weasel] has been staring at the coffin, his mouth never closed. He lifted one leg and went straight in.
0:50:0|0:50:13|[Zhao Qiquan] smiled at them. [Village Chief Si Lun] woke up from his dream. Someone was knocking on the door outside, calling his name. He lifted the covers, got out of bed, turned on the light in the room, put on his coat, and then opened the door.
0:50:58|0:51:9|[Grain House Aunt] explained the reason for stealing the cotton-padded jacket, and then returned the blackboard, making [Village Chief Si Lun] smile knowingly. Grandpa walked back and forth for dozens of miles.
0:51:14|0:51:25|[Grain House Aunt] wore an ill-fitting small cotton jacket, grinned at [Village Chief Si Lun] on the bed, and started crying while laughing. [Village Chief Si Lun] looked at his wife with satisfaction.
0:51:32|0:51:41|A few days later, [Shang Qinqin] was outside the door tidying up clothes. Upon hearing her mother-in-law's words, she spread out the clothes she had just tidied up, opening them one by one.
0:51:45|0:52:9|Shang Qinqin ignored the situation and continued to pack her luggage. Grain House Aunt kicked the open luggage shut. Shang Qinqin hesitated for a moment but quickly finished packing her luggage, stood up, and left her mother-in-law's house.
0:52:10|0:52:30|The neighbors from the in-laws' house stood at the door watching the excitement, seeing [Shang Qinqin] leave. The villagers sitting around chatting at the village entrance also focused on him when they saw [Shang Qinqin] appear. Walking through the crowd watching the excitement from street to alley, [Shang Qinqin] left the temple.
0:52:30|0:52:37|Just out of the village, [Shang Qinqin] saw [Zhao Deyi]. After asking a question, he quickly looked back at the road behind him.
0:52:40|0:52:59|The two looked at each other, and when Shang Qinqin didn't speak, Zhao Deyi asked. When Shang Qinqin finally responded, Zhao Deyi smiled, but Zhang Qinjin did not respond to him, and the two remained silent.
0:52:59|0:53:11|After a moment, [Zhao Deyi] smiled, reached out to hold Zhang Qinjin's hand, but Zhang Qinjin quickly withdrew it, turning to look back the way they came. [Zhao Deyi]'s lips trembled slightly as he nervously said.
0:53:30|0:53:41|After speaking, he went to grab Qin Qing's injured hand again, but Qin Qing dodged once more. He looked up at [Zhao Deyi], tears immediately welled up in his eyes.
0:53:54|0:54:1|Shang Qinqin had tears on her face, but a smile played at the corners of her mouth.
0:54:6|0:54:10|[Shang Qinqin] avoids eye contact with [Zhao Deyi] and lowers her eyes.
0:54:17|0:54:32|Shang Qinqin still did not respond to him, just silently shedding tears. Zhao Deyi tentatively leaned forward, wanting to reach out and hug Shang Qinqin. This time she did not refuse, but instead leaned her head on Zhao Deyi's shoulder.
0:54:32|0:54:44|[Zhao Deyi] embraced [Shang Qinqin] and she buried her head in his neck, crying in grievance. [Zhao Deyi] stroked her head, trying to comfort her emotions.
0:54:44|0:55:4|At dusk, [Zhao Deyi] carried pots, pans, and some luggage on his back as he walked on a small mountain path, occasionally looking back. After making sure no one was following him, he strode forward. He stepped over the rugged road and arrived at a dilapidated hut outside the village. After confirming no one was behind him, he entered the house.
0:55:6|0:55:18|Early the next morning, [Shang Qinqin] was cooking for [Zhao Deyi]. He put chopped green onions, shredded carrots, and other ingredients into the cooked noodle bowl, then stirred constantly with chopsticks.
0:55:46|0:55:50|[Zhao Deyi] came out of the house, and the children at the door scattered in a commotion.
0:56:30|0:56:48|[Shang Qinqin] listened to everything in the cabin, feeling very uneasy. After the matter was resolved, [Zhao Deyi] went to the village store to buy vegetables. The shopkeeper handed out change to [Zhao Deyi] with tweezers. [Zhao Deyi] opened his shirt pocket and gestured for the shopkeeper to throw it in.
0:56:48|0:56:53|Unable to resist [Zhao Deyi] constantly whistling to himself, the shopkeeper hurriedly drove him away.
0:57:6|0:57:23|Two men chased after [Shang Qinqin] with brooms. [Shang Qinqin] ran all over the street, scaring off a few donkeys, and the villagers came out to watch the commotion. [Shang Qinqin] ran into a dead end, and the two men, in order to avoid stepping on her, ended up riding on top of her.
0:57:30|0:57:34|[Zhao Deyi] lifted the grain again, and the two young men who splashed it ran up to him.
0:58:15|0:58:22|These two young men followed [Zhao Deyi] to the side of the cabin. In the courtyard, [Shang Qinqin] was wearing a tank top and shorts, hanging clothes.
0:58:37|0:58:56|The young man saw [Zhao Deyi] like this and immediately turned and ran away. Shang Qinqin saw the playful Zhao Deyi, with a smile in her eyes. As the sun set, the evening glow gradually diminished. Zhao Deyi and Shang Qinqin sat on the stone in front of the cabin, embracing each other.
0:59:10|0:59:15|Shang Qinqin's face gradually turned serious. She let go of Zhao Deyi's hand and looked up at him.
0:59:17|0:59:37|The two looked at each other, neither saying a word, just remaining silent. After a long while, they returned to the small room. [Zhao Deyi] sat on the earthen kang, leaning against the broken wall, lost in thought. Even when Zhang Qingqing took off her coat and sat beside him in her tight-fitting clothes, he remained lost in a daze.
0:59:38|0:59:58|[Shang Qinqin] smiled charmingly, her eyes rolling as she deliberately slid a finger lightly on the back of her hand, teasing [Zhao Deyi] continuously. However, [Zhao Deyi] remained unmoved. [Shang Qinqin] then stopped her actions, pondered for a moment, and said to the disheartened [Zhao Deyi],
1:0:17|1:0:23|[Zhao Deyi] looked at her puzzled, and with a calm smile, he held her hand tightly and continued to speak.
1:0:32|1:0:46|In the dimly lit room, the candlelight shines on Zhao Deyi's face, reflecting the tears in his eyes. Shang Qinqin holds his hand, staring blankly at him.
1:1:0|1:1:20|After a night, [Zhao Deyi] still lingered in bed, furrowing his brow and changing positions before falling back asleep. [Shang Qinqin], on the other hand, got up early to wash and hang out the clothes. As she turned around, she saw a group of people heading towards Zhuang's field in the village, some carrying shovels and others wearing school caps and dirty clothes.
1:1:52|1:2:4|Shang Qinqin stood still absentmindedly, not responding. Big Mouth put down the tattered horn and forced a smile.
1:2:6|1:2:21|The wind blew [Shang Qinqin]'s hair into a mess, with stray strands flying in front of her face. [Big Mouth] put a silver spring flower behind her ear, then turned back and grinned at [Shang Qinqin], who smiled back at her.
1:2:36|1:2:50|The funeral procession gradually moved away, the weather also became gloomy, and distant thunder could be heard. Soon, a drizzle started to fall. [Zhao Deyi] got up and sat by the anti-inflammatory stove, holding a cigarette in his hand.
1:3:2|1:3:8|Zhang Qingqing looked at [Zhao Deyi] with tears in his eyes, waiting for his response.
1:3:11|1:3:19|The next day, Zhao Deyi went to find Grain House Aunt, who was watering the vegetable seedlings in the field.
1:3:24|1:3:27|[Lao Zhuzhu] turned his head and glanced at him.
1:3:36|1:3:49|[Lao Zhuzhu] directly refused and turned to do the work in his hands. [Shang Qinqin] walked over from not far away, knelt down towards [Lao Zhuzhu], and plop, knelt on the ground. [Lao Zhuzhu] saw this scene, turned his head unwilling to look directly at the two people.
1:4:30|1:4:43|[Zhao Deyi] listened on the side and also knelt down with [Shang Qinqin]. [Village Chief Si Lun] hugged by the field, but his heart was still touched. Another day passed, [Zhao Deyi] and [Shang Qinqin] walked out of the temple.
1:4:43|1:4:52|[Shang Qinqin] is holding a sun umbrella, while [Zhao Deyi] is carrying a gift in one hand and a bag of snacks in the other. The two of them are walking on a country road, one on the left and the other on the right.
1:4:54|1:5:15|After walking for a long time, [Shang Qinqin] fell behind [Zhao Deyi], who was struggling to walk in high heels at the crossroads. After a dozen miles, the two finally arrived at the entrance of [Hao Yan]'s village. [Shang Qinqin] waited for [Zhao Deyi] under the shade of a tree at the village entrance, while [Zhao Deyi] entered the village alone.
1:5:15|1:5:22|[Zhao Deyi] said something to [Hao Yan], who was seen sobbing with her head down. Her son walked out from the house.
1:5:29|1:5:53|[Zhao Deyi] saw his son and his eyes immediately welled up with tears. He turned his head away, not responding to his son. [Village Chief Si Lun] also put on a brave face and went to [Zhao Xiaohai]'s house. As he was about to push the door open, the shouts of the neighbors interrupted him. [Village Chief Si Lun] left [Zhao Xiaohai]'s house and found him in the field.
1:6:8|1:6:14|[Zhao Xiaohai] took a deep drag on [Lao Zhuzhu]'s cigarette, then stood up and crushed the butt with his foot.
1:6:48|1:7:2|[Zhao Deyi] learned about this matter and immediately came to [Zhao Xiaohai]'s house. He leaned on the doorstep of [Zhao Xiaohai]'s house, writing on a piece of paper. As soon as he finished writing, [Zhao Xiaohai] reached out his hand. [Zhao Deyi] glanced at him and flicked the paper onto his face.
1:7:4|1:7:23|After the performance, [Zhao Deyi] glared at him resentfully before turning away. In the afternoon, [Zhao Deyi] and [Shang Qinqin] returned home carrying their bedding rolls and luggage. [Shang Qinqin] struggled with the heavy suitcase, panting heavily. [Zhao Deyi] walked ahead, guiding him along the way.
1:7:23|1:7:32|After pushing open the iron gate, the courtyard was in a mess, with leaves and dust covering the ground, making it difficult to walk. After exchanging a glance, they put down their luggage and started cleaning up.
1:7:39|1:7:56|[Zhao Deyi] draws water from the well in the courtyard, fills a bucket, and then carries it to the nearby vegetable garden to water the plants. Turning around, he watches [Shang Qinqin] mopping the floor inside the house, a smile forming at the corner of his mouth, before turning back to the clean well.
1:7:56|1:8:6|[Shang Qinqin] walked out of the house carrying a basin of dirty water, splashing it outside while looking at [Zhao Deyi] with a smile. Then she walked to the side of the well, wiping her sweat with a towel.
1:8:18|1:8:22|Shang Qinqin picked up the clothes and wiped her belly again.
1:8:35|1:8:54|Upon hearing this, Zhang Qingqing ran over and took Zhao Deyi's hand, and the two of them happily ran out to open the door. However, after the door opened, they did not see Zhao Qiquan, only a large sack at the door. They looked around but couldn't see anyone, then ran to the end of the alley to check, still finding nothing.
1:8:55|1:9:8|Two people looked at the rice in the big sack, not knowing who sent it. In the evening, [Shang Qinqin] developed a fever and lay in bed. [Zhao Deyi] placed a towel on her forehead to cool her down, and brought a bowl of medicine.
1:9:9|1:9:18|He reached out and touched Shang Qinqin's neck, feeling surprisingly hot. Then he removed the towel from Shang Qinqin's forehead to wake her up.
1:9:48|1:9:51|[Zhao Deyi] looked at him, and it took him a while to spit out a word.
1:10:24|1:10:32|Shang Qinqin angrily knocks over the pills in Zhao Deyi's hand, revealing the patches on his chest.
1:10:38|1:10:43|Shang Qinqin glanced at the spots on Zhao Deyi's body and said coldly.
1:10:55|1:11:9|[Zhao Deyi] stared at [Shang Qinqin] for a while, then got up and opened the cabinet next to him, searching for the hemp rope inside. Seeing this, [Shang Qinqin] looked away. [Zhao Deyi] angrily threw a stool under the beam and stood on it.
1:11:11|1:11:31|[Zhang Qingqing] unconsciously looked at him, only to see [Zhao Deyi] wiping away tears with his clothes, swinging the hemp rope onto the beam, then looping the ends of the rope into two live buckles that could fit into his head. He then stuck his head into one of the buckles, adjusted it to the right size, and looked at [Zhang Qingqing] on the bed. A tear rolled down the corner of [Zhang Qingqing]'s eye.
1:11:31|1:11:49|One hand involuntarily tightened the blanket around him, with [Zhao Deyi] standing on it, looking at him; but he didn't expect that [Shang Qinqin] calmly lifted the blanket, put on shoes, combed her hair carefully with a comb, and together they stood on a chair, putting their heads into the noose.
1:11:49|1:11:54|[Zhao Deyi] couldn't believe it at all, he stared at [Shang Qinqin] without blinking.
1:12:2|1:12:13|[Zhao Deyi] saw [Shang Qinqin] so determined, he couldn't help but feel scared in his heart. He lowered his head, clutching his clothes tightly, and there was no sound in the room. Both of them stood still on the stools.
1:12:13|1:12:25|After a moment, Zhao Deyi suddenly looked at Shang Qinqin and smiled, then lowered his head, reached behind the rope, and pulled his head out of the noose.
1:12:35|1:13:2|After speaking, he jumped off the stool, wiped away the smile on his face, and looked up at [Shang Qinqin]. [Shang Qinqin]'s expression finally softened, tears in the corners of his eyes turning into a smile. [Zhao Deyi] lifted [Shang Qinqin] off the stool and placed him on the bed, burying his head on his chest, and fell into a deep sleep.
1:13:5|1:13:21|Early the next morning, while the two were still fast asleep, the door was suddenly knocked. [Zhao Deyi] woke up from his dream, got up in a daze, rubbed his eyes, and ran towards the door.
1:13:52|1:14:3|Zhang Qingqing walked out of the house, bent down to pick up the marriage certificate on the ground, brushed off the dust on it, and hugged it as if she had obtained a treasure. Zhao Deyi was still looking in the direction where his brother [Zhao Qiquan] had left.
1:14:4|1:14:24|After returning home and changing into clean clothes, [Shang Qinqin] held money in her hand and happily arrived in front of the store. Coincidentally, the shopkeeper had just finished washing his face and, seeing her approaching, turned to open the store door. It was Zhao Deyi who had just woken up from his nap, feeling the bed beside him.
1:14:27|1:14:48|For half a day, no one responded to him. Exhausted, he propped up his neck and searched for [Shang Qinqin] in the room. Then he weakly laid his head on the pillow, extending an arm and softly calling out. [Shang Qinqin] was sitting in front of the dressing table, carefully grooming herself.
1:14:51|1:14:59|Upon hearing Zhao Deyi calling her "mother," [Shang Qinqin] chuckled and walked to the bedside, holding his hand, and joyfully said to him.
1:15:1|1:15:12|After speaking, with her eyes closed, she leaned her head towards him, and Zhao Deyi touched her forehead with his hand. [Shang Qinqin] then turned around and ran to the dressing table to pick up something.
1:15:19|1:15:23|Shang Qinqin pulled him up from the bed and tidied his hair.
1:15:29|1:15:45|[Zhao Deyi] smiled at him, then slumped back onto the bed. [Shang Qinqin] grabbed his arm, trying to pull him up, but to no avail. He pulled down [Zhao Deyi]'s pants and bit his buttocks.
1:15:49|1:15:55|[Zhao Deyi], dressed neatly, hand in hand with [Shang Qinqin], went door to door to distribute candies to the villagers.
1:16:2|1:16:9|The villager hesitated to accept the candy at the back, feeling reluctant but unable to refuse, so he had to lift his apron and take the candy.
1:16:14|1:16:18|The villagers at the village entrance all refused their wedding candies.
1:16:24|1:16:35|[Shang Qinqin] didn't care at all, proudly showing off the marriage certificate to others, and the two of them playfully knocked on another door.
1:16:52|1:16:56|[Weasel] gave a forced smile and then closed the door.
1:17:1|1:17:9|[Zhao Deyi] grabbed a handful of candy and threw it into the courtyard, then peeled one open to feed [Shang Qinqin].
1:17:10|1:17:14|In the courtyard, [Weasel] squatted down and picked up the sugar one by one.
1:17:17|1:17:39|Then she placed the wedding candies on the table at home, dividing them into two small piles, with one pile placed in the empty bowl in front of her. Behind the bowl was a photo of a young woman, with a photo of herself and him clipped in the lower right corner. She tore open a candy wrapper, put the candy in her mouth, but tears and snot couldn't help but flow down.
1:17:39|1:17:46|She looked at the photo, unable to hold back her tears. After handing out the candy, [Shang Qinqin] and [Zhao Deyi] went back to the railway track.
1:17:52|1:18:16|At this moment, the two of them were immersed in the joy of their new marriage. They were far away from the village, holding hands and wandering on the railway tracks. [Lao Zhuzhu] sat alone in the school, the courtyard empty. He was at a loss, with his arms on his knees, looking left and right. In the not-so-distant mountains, firecrackers sounded loudly.
1:18:29|1:18:40|[Zhao Qiquan] led a large group of people to dig up his son [Zhao Xiaoxin]'s coffin, wrapped the old coffin in a festive silk cloth, and placed it in a luxurious coffin.
1:18:41|1:19:1|Several people are carrying a coffin at the front, followed closely by two paper figures. One paper figure has a photo of [Zhao Xiaoxin] on its head, and the other has a photo of a woman. Behind them, people are carrying paper-made luxury cars, ships, and airplanes, as well as large amounts of commemorative coins, bank cards, and other items.
1:19:2|1:19:12|In the coffin car of [Zhao Xiaoxin], there are also a cameraman and a person shouting and singing. In this way, [Zhao Xiaoxin]'s coffin was grandly carried out of the temple.
1:19:27|1:19:44|After the wedding of his son Zhao Xiaoxin, Zhao Qiquan was in high spirits and rode his motorcycle singing loudly. Hearing the sound, Village Chief Si Lun from the school rushed out. He furrowed his brows, feeling a mix of emotions, and the suppressed anger inside him forced him to quicken his pace.
1:19:44|1:19:53|At the bend in the road, he successfully met his son [Zhao Qiquan]. [Zhao Qiquan] stopped the motorcycle.
1:20:52|1:20:59|[Lao Zhuzhu] looked weakly at [Zhao Qiquan], as the sky darkened, and the second son [Zhao Deyi] ran into trouble on his wedding night.
1:21:8|1:21:18|[Zhao Deyi] was sweating profusely, writhing in pain on the bed, biting the bedding hard. Shang Qinqin hugged him tightly, pressing her body against his back.
1:23:15|1:23:20|[Zhao Deyi]'s mind became increasingly unclear, and in the midst of confusion, he even reminded [Shang Qinqin] not to forget to wake himself up.
1:23:21|1:23:41|After finishing speaking, he passed out completely in pain. Zhang Qingqing held his head, constantly stroking the face of [Zhao Deyi]. By midnight, [Zhao Deyi]'s condition became uncontrollable. In order to alleviate his condition, Zhang Qingqing, dragging her weak body, fetched a basin of cold water from the well.
1:23:41|1:23:44|[Zhao Deyi] breathed heavily, feeling like his body was being roasted by fire.
1:23:47|1:24:6|Shang Qinqin placed the wet towel on her forehead, but Zhao Deyi still felt like there was a fire burning inside him. Shang Qinqin kept shuttling between the house and the yard, continuously pressing down on the raised handle. Zhao Deyi groaned weakly in the house.
1:24:10|1:24:27|Shang Qinqin kept wiping Zhao Deyi's body with a towel, then ran to the yard to change the water. Back and forth, he expended a lot of energy, the basin filled with water was undoubtedly a heavy burden for him at the moment, but he dared not slack off and quickly carried it back into the house.
1:24:31|1:24:47|[Zhao Deyi]'s symptoms showed no signs of improvement. Towels were changed one after another, but in a blink of an eye, they were all heated up by his body. [Shang Qinqin], who was fetching water, had run out of strength. She stopped her movements and stood by the well, panting heavily.
1:24:52|1:25:13|[Zhao Deyi] was still shouting, without much thought, he took off his clothes and lifted his leg to sit in the cold water tub in the middle of the courtyard. The piercing cold made him unable to help but exhale, then [Zhang Qingqing]'s body kept trembling, but he still sat inside, letting the cold water penetrate his warmth.
1:25:13|1:25:16|[Zhao Deyi] lay on the bed in pain, screaming.
1:25:24|1:25:41|After her body cooled down, [Zhang Qingqing] emerged from the water tank, quickly put on her slippers, and the ice-cold water flowed down her body, soaking the bricks and tiles in the courtyard. She pressed her freezing body against [Zhao Deyi]'s hot body, and [Zhao Deyi] immediately embraced her trembling body.
1:25:42|1:25:59|At this moment, the temporary relief of his restlessness was finally brought by the chill. But soon after, [Shang Qinqin]'s body was also heated up by him, to the point where [Shang Qinqin] had to once again immerse her body in the cold water tank.
1:26:7|1:26:16|[Zhang Qingqing] once again emerged from the water tank, her hands crossed weakly in front of her chest, unable to resist the cold night wind. As she walked barefoot into the house, she immediately leaned against [Zhao Deyi].
1:26:18|1:26:28|Once the raging fire inside him gradually subsided, Zhao Deyi's cries stopped, and Shang Qinqin stayed close to him, absorbing the dryness and heat from his body.
1:26:28|1:26:38|When his body was warmed up by himself again, he ran out to the yard, immersed his body in the cold water tank, then ran back to stick to [Zhao Deyi], repeating this process continuously.
1:26:40|1:27:1|Getting in and out of bed, into the water tank and out, dragging his cold and weak body without any slack. After countless back and forth trips, Zhao Deyi's heat and restlessness were finally relieved. He fell asleep heavily against Shang Qinqin's cold body. Shang Qinqin also lay in his arms, exhausted and fell asleep.
1:27:1|1:27:9|The two cuddled closely together, spending their wedding night. The next morning, the entire Niangniang Temple village was still immersed in silence.
1:27:10|1:27:25|After a whole night of suffering from illness, [Zhao Deyi] finally regained consciousness. His lips were cracked and peeling, with the skin on his upper lip sticking to the skin on his lower lip, as he swallowed some saliva.
1:27:30|1:27:34|Seeing no one responding, he weakly shook his head and swallowed saliva.
1:27:38|1:27:47|The room remained quiet, with no one responding. He reached out his hand, habitually feeling towards the other side of the bed, but did not touch the familiar body as usual.
1:28:8|1:28:23|At this moment, [Shang Qinqin] was lying half-naked on the ground, covered with a thin blanket. [Zhao Deyi] pounded his other hand, swinging it aimlessly. [Shang Qinqin] still lay on the ground, showing no response.
1:28:23|1:28:32|[Zhao Deyi] pursed his lips, struggled to open his eyes, and habitually reached out his hand towards the dressing table, gesturing for [Shang Qinqin] to come to his side.
1:28:37|1:28:51|He repeatedly shook his wrist, but still did not receive those warm hands. After a while, he slowly raised his neck and looked towards the direction of the dressing table, seeing no one, then turned to the other side, only to catch a glimpse of the injured Qin Qin lying on the ground.
1:28:52|1:29:12|Shang Qinqin, pale-faced and motionless, Zhao Deyi gazed at Zhao Qiquan for a long time. His wedding clothes lay neatly on the ground. Shirtless, Zhao Deyi stood up, took a machete, and hacked at his own thigh. Despite rolling in pain last night, he seemed to feel no pain at this moment.
1:29:12|1:29:17|He looked at Zhao Qiquan on the ground with a bitter smile, once again swinging the machete towards his own thigh.
1:29:21|1:29:26|The sunlight shone in from the window, falling directly on [Zhao Deyi], as he looked at [Shang Qinqin] and smiled.
1:29:29|1:29:44|The veins on her forehead bulged, as if this sound had drained all her strength, and tears kept flowing from her eyes. Despite the myriad of emotions surging in her heart at this moment, she could only look at [Shang Qinqin] in despair.
1:29:44|1:29:51|The temple of the goddess is still so quiet, with festive stickers on the walls outside, but a pool of blood is seeping out from between the cracks in the wall.
1:29:52|1:30:14|In the room, the marriage certificate on the ground still had photos of two people attached to it. In his dying moments, Zhao Deyi seemed to see the day before the wedding, when he and Shang Qinqin went to give Weasel wedding candies.
1:30:31|1:30:42|Zhang Qingqing had a piece of candy in her mouth, [Zhao Deyi] leaned against the wall and reached out to her. Zhang Qingqing, blushing, held his hand and leaned towards him, then read the marriage certificate.
1:31:0|1:31:6|[Zhao Deyi] looked at [Shang Qinqin] with deep affection in his eyes, which were also moistened by tears.
1:31:49|1:31:51|The two of them looked at each other and laughed.
