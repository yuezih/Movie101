0:1:28|0:1:43|The driver got out of the car and headed straight for the entrance of the club. He skillfully turned a corner and walked into the long corridor covered with posters.
0:2:48|0:2:56|[Lu Xiaoxing] threw him over her shoulder and slammed him to the ground, leaving everyone around in shock. She dragged [Liang Cong] out of the club as if she was escorting a prisoner.
0:2:59|0:3:11|[Liang Cong] struggled constantly, finally running out when [Lu Xiaoxing] opened the door, but before she could take a few steps, she was kicked to the ground by [Lu Xiaoxing]. Impatiently, she tore off the decorative chain on [Liang Cong]'s pants and tied [Liang Cong]'s hands to the handle above the front passenger seat.
0:3:21|0:3:27|[Lu Xiaoxing] sat in the driver's seat with a cold expression, skillfully started the car, reversed, and then shifted gears, leaving the club with [Liang Cong].
0:3:27|0:3:44|It is late at night, the car is driving smoothly on the overpass. [Liang Cong] struggles for a long time but fails to break free from the iron chains, feeling frustrated. Meanwhile, [Lu Xiaoxing] drives expressionlessly, completely ignoring him. [Liang Cong] looks at [Lu Xiaoxing] pleadingly.
0:4:1|0:4:6|[Liang Cong] angrily stared at [Lu Xiaoxing], then suddenly extended his foot towards the bottom of the driver's seat and stepped on the gas pedal all the way down.
0:4:9|0:4:18|The car suddenly accelerated out of control, with [Lu Xiaoxing] trying to hold onto the steering wheel. Unaware that the seatbelt buckle had been undone, a bus suddenly appeared, causing [Lu Xiaoxing] to jerk the steering wheel.
0:4:18|0:4:36|Temporarily escaping danger, the wheels lost control again, crashing into the roadside guardrail. [Lu Xiaoxing] felt a sudden darkness before her eyes, knowing nothing. When she regained consciousness, she found herself lying on the ground, covered in bruises, gazing confusedly at the car stuck in the middle of the guardrail.
0:4:38|0:4:45|The car was swaying dangerously, while [Liang Cong] was still tied inside.
0:4:53|0:5:1|Liang Cong was eager to save himself, struggling constantly with his wrist. But as the movement intensified, the car tilted more and more severely. Liang Cong looked in horror at the vehicles passing under the bridge.
0:5:11|0:5:25|[Liang Cong] desperately pulled down the chain, unaware that the railing was becoming less able to support the weight of the car. Just as he managed to break free with all his strength, the car finally couldn't hold on any longer and flipped off the bridge.
0:5:26|0:5:46|As the car fell off the bridge, a truck came head-on and hit the car, sending it flying more than ten meters before coming to a stop. There were no cars passing by on the elevated highway late at night, leaving only [Lu Xiaoxing] lying on the ground, unconscious of his fate. The truck below the bridge with its hazard lights on stopped in the middle of the road, and the driver showed no intention of getting out.
0:5:46|0:5:51|[Lu Xiaoxing] closed his eyes tightly, and after moving his lips a few times, he remained unresponsive.
0:5:57|0:6:7|Three years have passed in the blink of an eye. Today is a sunny day, with the sunshine streaming into the room warmly. On the top shelf of the bookcase are a row of detective books, while below are various items such as a printer, stapler, computer, and so on.
0:6:10|0:6:33|The calendar on the table clearly shows that today is April 4, 2015. At this moment, [Lu Xiaoxing] is sound asleep in bed, while a Labrador retriever is pulling the curtains with its teeth, drawing them to the side. It then skillfully jumps onto [Lu Xiaoxing]'s bed, pulls back the blanket covering her, and proceeds to nuzzle her face repeatedly.
0:6:33|0:6:48|[Lu Xiaoxing] turned over drowsily, slowly opened her eyes. Her pupils were unfocused. She looked ahead blankly, the car accident had taken away her younger brother and her eyesight. [Lu Xiaoxing] half-sat on the bed.
0:6:48|0:6:58|After fumbling to get the phone, Lu Xiaoxing slid up the screen and skillfully tapped on the app on the left to open the radio. After doing all this, she tentatively put on her slippers by the bedside.
0:7:32|0:7:45|After finishing washing up, [Lu Xiaoxing] went to the cloakroom and felt the Braille on the clothes hangers to choose the outfit for the day. After changing clothes, she stuffed the diary on the table into her bag, and then put on the guide dog's special leash for the Labrador Retriever.
0:7:45|0:8:4|After completing all the preparations, she slowly walked towards the gate with the guide dog leading the way. Despite the inconveniences in the life of a blind person, she carefully felt for the door handle and then moved to the latch, turning it open. Taking a deep breath, [Lu Xiaoxing] twisted the door handle and walked out of the house.
0:8:4|0:8:17|She walked slowly down the corridor with her guide dog, facing the sunlight, her shadow stretched long, marking the first step towards her new life. At this moment, [Lu Xiaoxing] walked into the Yanzhou Police Academy with her guide dog.
0:8:17|0:8:31|This is the place she is most familiar with, and also the starting point of her own ideals. Inside the academy, police officers in formal attire can be seen everywhere. [Lu Xiaoxing] made an appointment with the teacher and sat on a chair in the long corridor.
0:8:33|0:8:40|[Lu Xiaoxing] turned to the side, looking earnestly towards Teacher Ma.
0:9:18|0:9:33|Lu Xiaoxing stood at the intersection and pressed the button of the pedestrian crossing signal for the visually impaired. However, to her surprise, the wires of this electric box had already been cut. At that moment, a man ran to the side of the road, looked around, and then dashed across.
0:9:33|0:9:44|Ignoring the red light on the zebra crossing, [Lu Xiaoxing] heard his footsteps and thought the green light was on, so she took [Liang Cong] by the hand and carefully stepped onto the zebra crossing. [Lu Xiaoxing]'s world was pitch black.
0:9:44|0:9:52|Subconsciously, only the green light was flickering not far away, when suddenly a car slammed on the brakes in front of [Lu Xiaoxing].
0:9:55|0:10:8|At that moment, [Lu Xiaoxing] was a bit flustered and at a loss, with the flashing red light ahead particularly glaring. [Lu Xiaoxing] quickly turned around, in her world only feeling a truck rushing towards her with strong light in the darkness.
0:10:8|0:10:21|The bus didn't slow down at all, it passed by [Lu Xiaoxing], who became even more panicked, looking around helplessly. [Liang Cong] quickly pulled her forward, wanting to cross the road quickly, but when they reached the curb, she stumbled on a step.
0:10:21|0:10:34|The shin hit the stone pier, and [Lu Xiaoxing] seemed accustomed to it. She felt her way to sit on the stone pier and rolled up her right trouser leg. Pressing to find two bruises, she took out a bottle of spray from her bag and sprayed it on her shin before heading home.
0:10:34|0:10:38|[Lu Xiaoxing] packed all her photos and certificates from the police academy into a cardboard box.
0:10:38|0:10:57|Then she proceeded to take down all the criminal investigation books from the bookshelf and put them into a cardboard box. With great effort, she moved the box into the storage room and closed the door. For Lu Xiaoxing, these things might never be needed again. At that moment, Liang Cong was eating food attentively, while Lu Xiaoxing sat on the carpet nearby, listening to the sounds around her.
0:10:57|0:11:2|Liang Cong glanced at [Lu Xiaoxing], placed the food tray in front of [Lu Xiaoxing], and sat down obediently.
0:11:10|0:11:20|The sunshine outside the window is still bright, while the kitchen stove is cluttered with chopped food. The mess in the kitchen can be identified through the food residues, which was caused by preparing a meal for [Liang Cong].
0:11:20|0:11:31|[Liang Cong] was lying lazily in the arms of [Lu Xiaoxing], enjoying himself, while a girl threw herself at the iron gate, desperately pulling the handle. Her wrist was dripping with blood, but the gate didn't budge an inch.
0:11:31|0:11:42|She leaned against the iron gate, crying out in despair. Suddenly, her face turned pale with fear as she listened carefully to the noise outside the door. She saw the girl quickly crawl to the corner of the stairs next to the iron gate and crouched down, not daring to move.
0:11:42|0:11:55|As the footsteps and whistling drew closer, the iron gate was opened. A pair of black leather shoes stepped in, seemingly unaware of the girl in the corner. He continued to walk inside, and the girl seized the opportunity to rush up the stairs and try to escape.
0:11:55|0:12:10|With a slip under her feet, a sound was made. She turned around in despair, shaking her head, and desperately climbed up the stairs. However, the man grabbed the girl's legs and she disappeared into the dark corner, the iron gate was closed again, and the huge iron lock on the door sent shivers down one's spine.
0:12:22|0:12:33|[Lu Xiaoxing] walked slowly to the entrance, feeling the wall and opening the access control phone in front of her. A middle-aged woman's figure appeared on the screen.
0:12:48|0:13:2|[Lu Xiaoxing] came to the villa and opened the French windows in the living room. Standing in the garden, she felt the atmosphere here and looked ahead blankly as if she had returned to her childhood.
0:13:5|0:13:10|In their youth, [Lu Xiaoxing] and [Liang Cong] joyfully ran in the garden, with mischievous [Liang Cong] climbing onto a sculpture.
0:13:11|0:13:37|[Liang Cong] climbed to the top, joyfully looking at the bird's nest above. [Lu Xiaoxing] withdrew her gaze, sighed silently, and realized that no one had been in the courtyard for a long time. The ground was covered with dry branches and fallen leaves, and the once pristine white sculpture that used to be climbed by the two of them had now become old and dilapidated. [Lu Xiaoxing] carefully made her way to the top floor along the handrail.
0:13:37|0:13:45|The previously familiar home now had to be navigated by feeling. She stood at the doorway of [Liang Cong]'s bedroom, a scene from the past reappearing before her eyes.
0:13:52|0:14:11|The young [Liang Cong] flashed a brilliant smile and strummed the guitar strings. [Lu Xiaoxing] seemed to really see [Liang Cong] sitting on the bed playing the guitar, tears instantly filled her eyes. She steadied her emotions, gently placed her hand on the wall, brushed past the poster photo of [Liang Cong], and walked to the middle of the cabinet.
0:14:11|0:14:23|On the cabinet stands the guitar that [Lu Xiaoxing] bought for [Liang Cong] back then. [Lu Xiaoxing] reaches out her hands, carefully picks up the guitar and holds it in her arms, gently stroking it. This is the bond between her and [Liang Cong], the only thing left for her to remember.
0:14:23|0:14:40|After brushing the strings, she finally showed a hint of a smile, but suddenly as if remembering something? In an instant, the smile disappeared, and she hurriedly tried to put the guitar back in its place. Her trembling hands failed to place the guitar smoothly on the stand, and the guitar slipped from her hand and fell to the ground.
0:14:48|0:15:5|The past is vividly remembered, always a hurdle that Lu Xiaoxing cannot get over. She stood there with her eyes tightly closed, motionless. If she hadn't been so excited at that time, would things not have turned out like this now? Unfortunately, there are no "ifs" in the world. After a long time, Lu Xiaoxing came down from the building and stopped in her tracks.
0:15:6|0:15:13|The mother walked slowly behind [Lu Xiaoxing], furrowing her brows. She took [Lu Xiaoxing]'s hand and placed a device the size of a cellphone in her palm.
0:16:3|0:16:26|The mother turned away, unable to hold back her tears. And at this moment, [Lu Xiaoxing] was already in tears. The mother was at a loss for words. [Lu Xiaoxing] no longer paid attention to her mother, expressionless, and walked towards the door.
0:16:37|0:16:40|She shook her head self-deprecatingly and walked out of the door, leaning against the door frame.
0:16:42|0:16:52|The rain at night grew heavier, and soon there were several large puddles. [Lu Xiaoxing] and a group of people were waiting for a bus at the bus stop by the road. Before long, many people hailed taxis and left.
0:17:11|0:17:17|Passengers waiting for the train suddenly all turned to look in the same direction.
0:17:28|0:17:33|[Lu Xiaoxing] may be in the dark, but she can still discern the movements of everyone around her through sound.
0:17:37|0:17:50|Time passed gradually, although the heavy rain continued, passengers at the station were gradually leaving. The remaining people became fewer and fewer, until only [Lu Xiaoxing] and a girl dressed provocatively, holding a cigarette, were left on the platform.
0:18:2|0:18:17|The taxi quickly drove up and stopped steadily in front of the girl. The girl frowned, looked up, and then ran to the passenger seat in the rain, opened the door, and got in. The last person at the station also left, leaving only [Lu Xiaoxing] standing there alone.
0:18:17|0:18:30|[Lu Xiaoxing] fell silent for a moment, tentatively reaching out her hand to hail a taxi. Her hand stayed frozen in mid-air for a while. She then attempted to change direction and gestured to hail a cab, but it was still quite challenging for the blind [Lu Xiaoxing].
0:18:30|0:18:46|She put down her hand somewhat hesitantly, but the extreme rain forced her to reach out for a taxi again. Her hand quickly got wet, but she failed to hail a cab. [Lu Xiaoxing] put down her arm in disappointment, and at that moment, a car drove towards [Lu Xiaoxing], its glaring headlights making her aware of its presence.
0:18:46|0:18:51|[Lu Xiaoxing] had a picture in her mind of a taxi pulling up in front of her.
0:19:0|0:19:8|After getting into the car carefully, the man drove away from the station, with no sign of the rain stopping outside, but instead it was pouring even harder.
0:19:29|0:19:39|At the moment when the man twisted the knob, the warm air flew out from the front passenger seat through layers of equipment and rushed towards [Lu Xiaoxing]. With the loss of sight, [Lu Xiaoxing]'s sense of smell became exceptionally sensitive.
0:19:46|0:19:54|[Lu Xiaoxing] felt for the button on the back seat door and rolled the window halfway down. The image of sitting in the back seat of a taxi with the window down flashed through her mind again.
0:19:56|0:20:4|The man closed the car window for [Lu Xiaoxing] from the driver's seat, and quietly observed [Lu Xiaoxing] through the rearview mirror, with a hint of cunning in his eyes.
0:20:10|0:20:18|The man took out a bottle of coffee, extended his right hand to the back seat, and [Lu Xiaoxing] hesitantly reached out with both hands to touch the man's wrist, then took the coffee from his hand.
0:20:19|0:20:25|[Lu Xiaoxing] held a cup of coffee in one hand and propped herself up on the seat with the other. After touching the seat, she paused for a moment and then touched it repeatedly several times.
0:20:29|0:20:34|The man was a little surprised and couldn't help but reach out his right hand and wave it in front of [Lu Xiaoxing] several times.
0:20:37|0:20:47|The man quickly withdrew his right hand, as if relieved, while [Lu Xiaoxing] held the coffee tightly in her hands without saying another word. The man then stole a glance at [Lu Xiaoxing] again.
0:21:2|0:21:13|A woman shattered the windshield and rolled over the roof of the car onto the road. A man got out of the car, bent over to support his knees, looked at the woman for a long time, then bent down and dragged the woman's upper body up.
0:21:13|0:21:32|[Lu Xiaoxing] was hit on the head by the sudden brake just now. She held her forehead for a long time before coming to her senses. With a furrowed brow, she instinctively looked up, her eyes filled with uncontrollable panic. [Lu Xiaoxing] felt around her seat, stuffing the recently dropped keys, pepper spray, and other items into her bag. Unfortunately, she didn't notice the diary that had fallen under the passenger seat. Afterwards, [Lu Xiaoxing] slung the bag over her shoulder.
0:21:32|0:21:47|Lu Xiaoxing found the switch to lock the car door, opened the door, and got out of the car. The rain outside was still heavy. She shielded her head with one hand and closed the car door with the other. At that moment, half of the man's body had just moved out of the trunk, and he immediately closed the trunk.
0:21:56|0:22:1|[Lu Xiaoxing] shook off the man's hand and took out her phone from her pocket, ready to make a call.
0:22:3|0:22:10|[Lu Xiaoxing] hurriedly crouched on the ground searching for her phone, while a man in the distance saw a car approaching and immediately bent down to pull [Lu Xiaoxing].
0:22:12|0:22:27|The man roughly pulled [Lu Xiaoxing] up, preparing to push her into the back seat. In desperation, [Lu Xiaoxing] grabbed the man's wrist and pinned him against the car. The man was unable to break free for a moment, but as the car behind approached, he panicked. He forcefully pushed [Lu Xiaoxing] to the ground, quickly opened the car door, sat in the driver's seat, and drove away from the scene.
0:22:27|0:22:35|[Lu Xiaoxing] struggled to get up and continued to search for the phone with [Lu Li]. She felt around on the ground for a long time and finally found it. [Lu Xiaoxing] quickly picked up the phone, ready to call the police.
0:22:36|0:22:44|The car drove straight towards them, its lights blinding. A drunk man sat on the sofa, laughing foolishly.
0:23:15|0:23:25|The young police officer glanced absentmindedly at the drunken man playing around with alcohol. Then he pretended to turn around seriously.
0:23:47|0:23:55|[Lu Xiaoxing] was turning her head in confusion about what was happening around her, when an old policeman behind her stood up, stretched lazily, and walked towards the drunkard.
0:24:32|0:24:38|The old police officer limped over to the young police officer and impatiently took off his glasses frame,
0:24:57|0:25:3|He tapped the young police officer's head, indicating him to continue flipping through the report, and sat in front of [Lu Xiaoxing].
0:25:30|0:25:42|The old police officer looked at Lu Xiaoxing in astonishment, but Lu Xiaoxing ignored him. She shook off the hand that grabbed her wrist, then reached out and held the arm of the young police officer. The officer dared not move recklessly and carefully escorted her to the door.
0:25:42|0:25:51|The old police officer sat in the chair, watching [Lu Xiaoxing] leave the office with a scrutinizing look on his face. Only after that, he struggled to lift his legs up, hugging his knees. He furrowed his brow and kept rubbing his knee joints.
0:25:52|0:26:15|The yellow light bulb flickered, revealing a mysterious atmosphere. A girl slowly opened her eyes on the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling. There were a few scratches and bruises on her face, with dried blood on the side. The girl subconsciously looked around and found another girl lying on a single bed to her left. The person's wrists and ankles were tied to the bed, her eyes half-open as if lifeless.
0:26:37|0:26:42|The man tenderly approached the girl, one hand clawing and pressing down on her head, his expression becoming even gentler.
0:26:44|0:26:53|The girl struggled in fear, but her movements became smaller and smaller, soon she stopped moving. Beside her lay a carefully kept diary, with a clear message written on it: "If you find this, please contact me" in eight words.
0:26:56|0:27:5|The man picked up a delicate surgical knife and cut along the lines drawn on the girl's face, blood gushing out and splashing onto the man's face. He didn't mind at all, but instead enjoyed it immensely.
0:27:7|0:27:24|Gently bending down, without hesitation, [Lu Xiaoxing] moved towards the girl. As he crawled, the man looked at the wall behind him, where a huge photo was projected. The photo showed a girl in white clothes with a lovely face, slightly round, and very cute. The slideshow kept changing, all showing the same girl's appearance.
0:27:24|0:27:31|A man's gaze is filled with infatuation and nostalgia, one day a person wearing black canvas shoes appears in the corridor of [Lu Xiaoxing]'s home.
0:27:53|0:27:58|[Lu Xiaoxing] walked out of the bathroom and reached for the door access phone on the wall.
0:28:13|0:28:22|The old police officer's words made [Liang Cong] furrow his brows, while [Lu Li] was lying on the ground. He looked expressionlessly at the young police officer who was pouting and amusing himself, then disdainfully turned his head away.
0:29:36|0:29:42|[Lu Li] hurriedly opened a notebook.
0:30:9|0:30:13|[Lu Li] involuntarily raised his left wrist.
0:30:23|0:30:31|Officer Lu Li turned his eyes, touched his nose, and nodded thoughtfully.
0:30:54|0:31:12|On another sunny day, on a spacious road, a group of rollerblading teenagers zoomed past, showing off their skills. Some leaped over safety belts, some jumped and did a 360-degree turn. A boy wearing a duckbill cap crossed a patch of empty space, then stylishly turned back, standing in front of a notice board.
0:31:12|0:31:20|Please read the above content carefully. The notice indicates that a traffic accident occurred on the evening of April 11th, and valuable clues are needed from the public.
0:31:44|0:31:51|The young police officer subconsciously propped up his chin and looked towards [Lu Li].
0:32:2|0:32:8|The young police officer awkwardly licked his lips, while Officer Lu continued to turn around and look at the slides.
0:32:29|0:32:37|The boy in the duckbill cap sat across from [Lu Li], impatiently glanced at [Lu Xiaoxing]. [Lu Li] raised his eyebrows and sighed, the boy seemed accustomed to such distrust and rolled his eyes.
0:32:37|0:32:45|He wanted to take a look at [Lu Xiaoxing], extending a finger to wave in front of [Lu Xiaoxing], and becoming even more audacious when he found [Lu Xiaoxing] unresponsive.
0:33:29|0:33:42|[Lu Xiaoxing] sat up straight and ignored the boy, who looked around boredly. Suddenly, he stared at the phone on [Lu Xiaoxing]'s table, took out his own phone and compared them side by side.
0:33:45|0:33:58|[Lu Xiaoxing] expressionlessly picked up her phone, turned on the camera, switched to selfie mode, and approached the boy. The boy confidently looked at the phone screen and even leaned towards the lens, narcissistically adjusting his bangs.
0:35:8|0:35:27|The boy's phone rang with a familiar tone, causing [Lu Xiaoxing] to involuntarily turn his body. After the boy finished the call with a smile, the mischievous expression returned to his face.
0:35:47|0:35:55|The boy reluctantly turned his head, giving a response, and then walked out of the office with a straight face. At this moment, a female police officer walked in holding a folder.
0:36:1|0:36:9|The policewoman looked up at [Lu Xiaoxing] and froze.
0:36:19|0:36:29|[Lu Li] was carefully looking at the documents. Gao Yanan smiled at [Lu Xiaoxing] and walked out of the office. It was only then that [Lu Li] looked up at the two of them, and a girl walked out of the nightclub in the evening.
0:36:31|0:36:40|The girl, with a graceful figure, wearing 10-centimeter high heels and holding a cigarette, walked down the stairs and waved to someone in the distance. A car parked steadily in front of her.
0:36:42|0:36:55|The girl leaned against the window with a smile, elegantly opened the car door and got in, while the driver was still the man who caused the accident. She threw the cigarette out of the window, fastened her seatbelt, and then the man smiled and drove away from the nightclub, with no one around noticing anything unusual.
0:36:57|0:37:15|[Lu Xiaoxing] returned home and once again opened the door to the storage room. She pulled out two large cardboard boxes and stacked them on the living room floor. Then she quietly knelt down beside one of the boxes, as if psyching herself up, took a deep breath, and opened the box. Inside, crime psychology and other criminal investigation books were neatly arranged.
0:37:30|0:37:44|[Lu Xiaoxing] suddenly received a call on her phone, the screen showed an unknown number, and she answered the call without any suspicion. Inside the car, a medicine bottle was left on the seat, and [Lu Xiaoxing]'s diary was held in the man's hand.
0:37:48|0:38:4|The man hung up the phone expressionlessly, flipped through his phone to carefully examine a photo. The girl in the photo was the one who had just gotten into his car. The man looked at the passenger seat with a smile that was not a smile, only to see that the girl had already fallen asleep. He then calmly threw the phone out of the car window and drove away in the sedan.
0:38:4|0:38:16|The following vehicle ran over the phone, instantly shattering it into pieces. There were many vehicles coming and going on this road, and soon the phone was crushed beyond recognition. Meanwhile, the police station was still brightly lit.
0:39:14|0:39:27|[Lu Xiaoxing] knew she was right, so she could only nod, while [Liang Cong] was sleeping soundly on the side. They spent the whole day listening to recordings in the car, and [Lu Li] handed a hamburger to [Lu Xiaoxing].
0:39:29|0:39:37|[Lu Li] nodded in agreement, opened the wrapper of the hamburger and took a big bite. [Liang Cong] sat in the back seat staring at the hamburger in [Lu Li]'s hand, almost drooling.
0:39:38|0:39:57|[Lu Li] jokingly handed the hamburger to [Liang Cong]'s mouth and then pulled it back. [Liang Cong], as if understanding, sat gloomily in the seat. After finishing the hamburger, [Lu Li] drove the car away from the roadside to take [Lu Xiaoxing] home.
0:39:57|0:40:4|On the other side, [Lin Chong] skated over and stopped in front of the sign, rolling his eyes disdainfully.
0:40:13|0:40:20|The man recalled the day when he was driving away and happened to pass by [Lin Chong] who was standing on the roadside holding an umbrella, and they both glanced at each other.
0:40:22|0:40:28|[Lin Chong] vented for a while as if not relieved, then took out his phone and called [Lu Li].
0:40:40|0:40:53|[Lin Chong] hung up the phone stubbornly, looking displeased at the screen. He then pocketed his phone and skated away from the billboard. A man sat in the car watching [Lin Chong], and when he saw [Lin Chong] leaving, he started the car and quietly followed behind him.
0:41:7|0:41:13|[Lu Li] blinked discreetly, [Lu Xiaoxing] was not surprised, just sighed softly.
0:41:54|0:42:6|[Lu Li] glanced guiltily at [Lu Xiaoxing], awkwardly waved his hand to fan the air around him, then quickly lowered the car window to let the smell dissipate. As the window went down, a familiar voice resounded once again, and [Lu Xiaoxing] listened quietly.
0:42:6|0:42:12|Her expression turned serious, as she recalled the man in the car also made the same sound when he rolled down the window.
0:42:13|0:42:21|After the man closed the window for [Lu Xiaoxing] from the driver's seat, the strange noise disappeared.
0:42:44|0:42:50|But on that taxi, [Lu Li] was a bit surprised and couldn't help but look at [Lu Xiaoxing] several times.
0:43:2|0:43:19|[Lu Xiaoxing] once again recalled the sound of the car hitting the girl and shattering the windshield that day, only this time the scene changed from a taxi to a Golf 6, and now this Golf 6 followed [Lin Chong] to a small fountain. He parked the car on the side, turned off the engine and lights, while [Lin Chong] remained completely unaware, sliding and answering the phone.
0:43:20|0:43:39|The man stared at [Lin Chong] intently, then gently closed the notebook. Beside the notebook was a delicate music box. The man was dressed smartly and wore a baseball cap. After getting off the car, he pulled up his scarf, revealing only his eyes. [Lu Li] hung up the phone, complaining.
0:43:46|0:43:58|[Lu Li] anxiously looked ahead and found the right moment to sharply turn the steering wheel. Making a U-turn and heading back, at this moment [Lin Chong] was still leisurely rollerblading forward.
0:44:12|0:44:19|[Lin Chong] hung up the phone, continued to slide forward with his hands in his pockets, skillfully took out a pair of black leather gloves, put them on, and continued to follow closely behind him.
0:44:26|0:44:47|[Lin Chong] unconsciously hummed a song, while the man looked back vigilantly, quickening his pace towards [Lin Chong] after confirming that no one was coming on the road. [Lin Chong] leisurely slid forward a few steps, suddenly feeling something amiss behind him. He subtly turned his head back a bit, stopped in his tracks, then boldly turned half of his face towards the man behind him, directly halting the man in his tracks. The man hesitated for a moment and didn't dare to approach, while [Lin Chong] nonchalantly turned away.
0:44:47|0:44:59|Rushing forward quickly, the man soon realized and sprinted after [Lin Chong]. [Lin Chong] swiftly turned a corner, while the man, after turning into an alley, stopped and looked around. He then picked up a motorcycle leaning against the wall and rode off.
0:45:1|0:45:18|The man once again closely followed behind [Lin Chong], who turned into a two-meter wide alley and desperately slid forward. Frowning, he glanced back and saw the motorcycle getting closer, its headlight illuminating the path clearly. Just as it was about to reach him, in the last moment, [Lin Chong] made a 180-degree sharp turn, facing the motorcycle once again.
0:45:18|0:45:41|He paused for a second, clearly seeing the fierce eyes of the man, then turned sharply again, gracefully sliding down the handrail of the stairs. The man slammed on the brakes, his face staring fiercely at the figure of [Lin Chong]. He started the motorcycle again and rode down the stairs in front of him. The motorcycle swiftly turned and caught up again. [Lin Chong] crossed a flower bed and slipped into a narrow alley only one meter wide. The motorcycle's inherent speed advantage quickly brought him up to [Lin Chong].
0:45:41|0:46:5|Behind him, after [Lin Chong] rushed out from under his feet and descended a few steps, the motorcycle followed without hesitation. Following directly behind [Lin Chong], the motorcycle turned a corner and slid into a construction site. He bent over and rotated, passing through the scaffolding and leaping over a large construction pit. Provocatively looking back, he leisurely slid away. The man stopped by the roadside, glanced at [Lin Chong], then turned and rode into another alley. [Lin Chong] breathed a sigh of relief only after watching him go far away.
0:46:7|0:46:13|[Lin Chong] looked puzzled and angry as he watched the direction the motorcycle was heading. He slid forward while taking out his phone, staring at the screen with a displeased expression.
0:46:15|0:46:34|[Lin Chong] impatiently put down his phone and slid towards the intersection. He didn't notice the Golf 6 parked next to him. Suddenly, the car's headlights lit up, shining into [Lin Chong]'s eyes. The car accelerated abruptly, hitting [Lin Chong] and sending him flying to the side of the road. [Lin Chong] fell to the ground, blood seeping from his head. The man quickly reversed the car and stopped in front of [Lin Chong] again, his foot constantly tapping the accelerator.
0:46:34|0:46:41|His face couldn't hide the cold and ruthless expression, he was about to step on the gas pedal, but a few boys appeared in front of him.
0:47:12|0:47:16|Xing stood by the roadside listening to the movement, unaware that the man was standing right beside her.
0:47:18|0:47:27|[Lu Li] returned to the car, [Lu Xiaoxing] fumbled and sat back in the passenger seat. Two ambulances drove forward, with [Lu Li]'s car following closely behind. The people around scattered, leaving only a man with his hands in his pockets.
0:47:27|0:47:42|Standing still for a while, he took two steps forward calmly, looked towards the direction where the ambulance was leaving. [Lin Chong]'s head was already bandaged, lying on the bed with an IV drip, still in a coma, while [Lu Xiaoxing] stood outside the window anxiously waiting.
0:48:7|0:48:13|At this moment, [Lu Xiaoxing] is sitting on a chair in the hospital lobby, while [Lu Li] walks over with two cans of coffee.
0:48:15|0:48:21|[Lu Li] carefully pulled the tab of the soda can for [Lu Xiaoxing], then sat down across from her.
0:48:30|0:48:44|[Lu Xiaoxing] stood up straight, carefully sniffing the small cart pushed behind her. She suddenly turned around to face the receding cart, once again plunged into memories. That night, the man turned the knob, turning on the warm air inside the car.
0:49:6|0:49:13|[Lu Li] furrowed his brow, looking serious, as he leaned back against the chair and nodded in agreement.
0:50:6|0:50:17|[Lu Li] quickly took the phone, took out his own phone while walking towards the nearby gate. After walking out of the gate, he looked solemnly at the screen of [Lu Xiaoxing], and immediately made a call with his own phone.
0:50:20|0:50:35|[Lu Xiaoxing] sat on the chair, looking somewhat serious. The next day, [Lin Chong] lay on the hospital bed, as if feeling some strange sensation, he furrowed his brow and opened his eyes. He saw [Liang Cong] licking his toes, which startled [Lin Chong] and made him pull back his toes and sit up.
0:51:26|0:51:33|[Lin Chong] sat on the other side of the hospital bed with his back to [Lu Xiaoxing], heaved a sigh of relief, picked up the roller skate shoe at his feet and held it in his arms, gently wiping away the dust on it.
0:51:55|0:52:3|Facing the perfunctory nod from [Lu Li], [Lin Chong] rolled his eyes speechlessly, feeling somewhat embarrassed in the face of [Lin Chong]'s lingering resentment.
0:52:18|0:52:23|[Lu Li] pointed angrily at [Lin Chong] while scratching his head, and [Lin Chong] turned around with a mocking smile.
0:52:28|0:52:34|[Liang Cong] looked at [Lu Li] with some dissatisfaction, and [Lu Li] quickly reached out to pat [Liang Cong]'s head.
0:54:0|0:54:16|[Lu Li] frowned and glanced at [Lu Xiaoxing], then looked silently out the window. The shower head kept spraying water out, while [Lu Xiaoxing] sat blankly in the bathtub, staring ahead with no expression. Suddenly, the alarm went off, and [Lu Xiaoxing] numbly got up from the edge of the bathtub, took the alarm and turned off the shower.
0:54:16|0:54:25|She didn't know the meaning of her actions, whether she was causing trouble or just thinking she was helping. She closed her eyes and heard [Lin Chong]'s angry words echoing in her ears.
0:54:44|0:55:1|[Lu Xiaoxing] weakly lifted her arm, embarrassedly covered her eyes, with numerous shallow and deep cuts on her arms and wrists. She sat in the water, tightly hugging her arms, as if only in this way could she give herself a little sense of security. The screen of the phone on the table suddenly lit up, still showing unknown.
0:55:1|0:55:12|Lu Xiaoxing, wearing a bathrobe, carefully stepped out of the bathroom, feeling her way to the table. She picked up the phone, took a deep breath, and held it to her ear.
0:56:33|0:56:48|The man greedily stared at the diary, with his phone placed on the table. [Lu Xiaoxing] was already in tears, putting down her phone in despair, finding it hard to accept the situation. The phone in the car rang, showing a call from [Lu Xiaoxing], while at that moment, [Lu Li] and [Jingkuang] were discussing the case at the scene outside the car.
0:57:14|0:57:20|He refused to move forward, no matter how much he looked up.
0:57:27|0:57:32|[Lin Chong] plugged in his phone to charge, the long message displayed on the screen made him furrow his brows.
0:57:32|0:57:44|Dozens of messages all came from [Lu Xiaoxing], almost all of them were dangerous, asking him not to leave the hospital now. As soon as the words fell, [Lu Xiaoxing] brought [Liang Cong] to the ward, leaving [Lin Chong] incredulously turning back.
0:58:19|0:58:33|[Lin Chong] broke free and walked away without looking back. His companions also sidled past [Lu Xiaoxing]. [Lu Xiaoxing] slowly lowered her hand, unaware that the man in the corner not far away had already set his sights on her.
0:58:41|0:58:58|[Lin Chong] looked in the direction of his companion, Lu Li, who was carefully boarding a bus on the opposite side of the street. Lin Chong lowered his head disdainfully, but suddenly straightened up in alert as he saw the man closely following Lu Xiaoxing onto the same bus. Lin Chong hesitated and took two uncertain steps forward.
0:58:58|0:59:6|He saw the man on the bus grabbing the handrail, step by step forcing [Lu Xiaoxing] [Lin Chong] to lower their heads, tightly gripping the phone, and making a decision in a moment.
0:59:13|0:59:29|[Lin Chong] rushed to the other side of the road, flagged down a bus and quickly got on. He anxiously put on his headphones and looked ahead at the bus where [Lu Xiaoxing] was sitting. His phone vibrated, and [Lu Xiaoxing] calmly raised the phone to his ear.
0:59:37|0:59:42|At this moment, [Lin Chong] was extremely anxious, constantly looking ahead, while [Lu Xiaoxing] was puzzled and still wearing headphones as instructed.
1:0:2|1:0:14|[Lu Xiaoxing] didn't realize that the man had been watching her every move without hiding it, while [Lin Chong] was staring at the front of the bus with his phone. Unexpectedly, the bus he was on started to turn right, and [Lin Chong] watched helplessly as the bus in front drove away.
1:0:14|1:0:19|Hastily running towards the rear door of the bus, [Lu Xiaoxing] kept staring at the bus where she was sitting as she ran.
1:0:20|1:0:26|The bus came to a stop just in time at the station. [Lin Chong] hurriedly got off the bus and ran towards the intersection, while [Lu Xiaoxing] pretended to stay calm and stood up.
1:0:39|1:0:47|[Lu Xiaoxing] walked forward stiffly, while [Lin Chong] held up his phone and could only see the car door through the camera.
1:0:50|1:0:58|[Lin Chong] was extremely anxious, his feet skating faster and faster. The bus quickly arrived at the stop and parked by the roadside. A man stood to the right rear of [Lu Xiaoxing], following her slow steps down the stairs.
1:1:7|1:1:18|The man followed [Lu Xiaoxing] closely, with a knife pressed tightly against her waist, showing no signs of relaxation. [Lu Xiaoxing] slowly moved onto the blind path, carefully walking forward. She slowly lowered her phone and reached into her shoulder bag to search.
1:1:18|1:1:26|The man stared alertly at the side of [Lu Xiaoxing], but paid no attention to her hand movements. Suddenly, [Lu Xiaoxing] took out a pepper spray, took a deep breath, and sprayed it backwards.
1:1:50|1:1:58|[Lu Xiaoxing] quickly turned into a street under the guidance of [Liang Cong] and [Lin Chong]. [Lin Chong] anxiously stared at his phone, his pace getting faster and faster, while [Lu Xiaoxing] had already reached the end of the road.
1:2:0|1:2:8|[Lu Xiaoxing] hurriedly stopped and felt the patterns on the floor. The man quickly caught up, following [Lu Xiaoxing] into the mall, rubbing his eyes constantly.
1:2:10|1:2:15|[Lu Xiaoxing] immediately turned the corner and started running along the right passage. The man walked faster and glanced back, his expression becoming even more ruthless.
1:2:18|1:2:26|[Lu Xiaoxing] rushed into the stairwell, losing control and hitting the wall. [Lin Chong] slid forward in increasing urgency, while [Lu Xiaoxing] stumbled down the stairs.
1:2:26|1:2:38|The man walked briskly in the mall, glancing around fiercely. At this moment, [Lu Xiaoxing] smoothly walked down the stairs and continued to run along the tactile paving. [Liang Cong] ran faster and faster, while [Lu Xiaoxing] was already exhausted, stumbling and falling to the ground.
1:2:54|1:3:3|[Lu Xiaoxing] felt the tactile paving under her feet, and the path ahead seemed to become clearer in her mind. At this moment, the man rushed towards the stairs, and [Lu Xiaoxing] stood up, feeling her way with her phone.
1:3:4|1:3:12|[Lin Chong] looked at the route on the video with a worried expression, while [Lu Xiaoxing] followed the route in her mind, holding her phone in one hand and feeling her way forward as she ran.
1:3:12|1:3:20|The pace is gradually accelerating, the man plunges into the stairwell and rushes downstairs quickly, [Liang Cong] sniffing the scent of [Lu Xiaoxing] on the ground, and swiftly running towards [Lu Xiaoxing].
1:3:20|1:3:36|[Lu Xiaoxing] dared not stop, running forward quickly. [Liang Cong] finally caught up with [Lu Xiaoxing], sprinting behind her, with the man also appearing at the back. Upon seeing [Lu Xiaoxing], his expression became even more ferocious, and his speed increased.
1:3:38|1:3:46|[Lu Xiaoxing] ran quickly, closely followed by [Liang Cong]. The man was only 100 meters away from them. [Lu Xiaoxing] went up a ramp along the blind road and rushed into a first-floor parking lot.
1:3:49|1:4:2|[Lu Xiaoxing] followed [Lin Chong]'s instructions and ran straight to the elevator, while [Liang Cong] also ran into the parking lot and headed towards [Lu Xiaoxing]. [Lu Xiaoxing] stumbled and threw herself against the elevator door, pressing the elevator button. Just as she crawled into the elevator, [Liang Cong] also rushed in.
1:4:3|1:4:21|At this moment, a man also entered the parking lot. [Lu Xiaoxing] hurriedly climbed to the door and pressed the button. The door immediately closed, but the man reached his arm into the elevator, opening the door. He looked viciously at [Lu Xiaoxing], took out a syringe from his pocket, removed the needle cover, grabbed [Lu Xiaoxing]'s chin, and pushed the syringe into [Lu Xiaoxing]'s neck.
1:4:21|1:4:31|Soon, Lu Xiaoxing's eyes became unfocused. Just as the man pulled out the syringe, Liang Cong pounced on him, biting onto his clothes. Liang Cong roared as he dragged the man out of the elevator shaft, refusing to let go.
1:4:31|1:4:42|Lu Xiaoxing subconsciously covered her neck and weakly fainted in the corner of the elevator, while Liang Cong bit down on the man's clothes and couldn't let go. The man then took out a surgical knife from his pocket without hesitation and stabbed towards Liang Cong.
1:4:42|1:4:55|Blood splattered all over the faces of the man and [Lu Xiaoxing]. [Liang Cong] sobbed, but still refused to let go. As the elevator doors slowly closed, the man could only watch [Lu Xiaoxing] leave helplessly. Inside the elevator, [Lu Xiaoxing] unconsciously furrowed her brows, but ultimately did not wake up.
1:4:55|1:5:12|The man vented all his grievances on [Liang Cong], who finally ran out of strength and weakly let go. The elevator successfully reached another floor, temporarily saving [Lu Xiaoxing]. [Liang Cong] lay on the ground covered in blood, already at the end of his tether. The man gritted his teeth in anger and gave [Liang Cong] a fierce glare.
1:5:12|1:5:20|Crossing over its body and running upstairs, at this moment, [Liang Cong] with eyes tightly closed, collapsed on the ground, bravely completing a lifetime.
1:5:29|1:5:35|A janitor was mopping the floor when she saw [Lu Xiaoxing], covered in blood, in the elevator, and she collapsed in fear.
1:5:35|1:5:49|[Lu Xiaoxing] was seen slumped in the corner of the elevator, completely unconscious. A police officer rushed into the elevator and quickly helped [Lu Xiaoxing] up, while another officer ran towards the door. A man peeked his head out from the corner, quietly watching the scene before him.
1:5:49|1:5:58|[Lu Xiaoxing] lay on the hospital bed, the scars on her wrist particularly striking, while [Lin Chong] sat by the bed with a worried expression written all over his face.
1:6:6|1:6:9|[Lu Li] hurriedly grabbed [Lu Xiaoxing]'s hand, looking helplessly to the side.
1:6:50|1:7:5|Lu Xiaoxing's hand was frozen in mid-air, unable to move for a moment. Lin Chong looked at Lu Xiaoxing, tears streaming down her face, with heartache. Lu Li furrowed his brows tightly, unable to bear turning away. Lu Xiaoxing's lips trembled, her nostrils slightly flared, as her emotions deepened.
1:7:5|1:7:20|Her shoulders couldn't help but tremble, [Lu Xiaoxing] tightly holding the traction belt in her arms, constantly rubbing the dog tag that resembled [Liang Cong]. She closed her eyes in pain, bowed her head weakly, and [Lu Xiaoxing] cried and cried, sliding directly from the hospital bed to sit paralyzed on the ground.
1:7:20|1:7:29|She tightly pressed the leash against her chest, as if trying to merge [Liang Cong] into her life, [Lu Xiaoxing] let out a weak roar, almost out of breath.
1:7:45|1:8:1|[Lu Li] covered his mouth and remained silent, looking out the window. [Lin Chong] stood on the side, silent with his head down. The only thing they could do at this moment was to silently accompany each other. The police station was bustling with activity, and an undercover police officer hurriedly walked towards [Lu Li]'s office with a file.
1:8:48|1:9:5|[Lu Li] gave the order, and the police officers rushed to their respective positions. On the other side, [Lin Chong] carefully described the man's appearance. Soon, a suspect's portrait appeared on the screen, bearing an 80% resemblance to the man. At that moment, the man was reading the news on his computer, where the details of the night's incident were vividly described.
1:9:5|1:9:20|The news reported that the public security department has launched a search based on information from eyewitnesses. The man here had a fierce look on his face, with the corners of his mouth twitching slightly. He collected himself, quickly tapping on the keyboard to look up more information, while the police station remained brightly lit at night.
1:9:37|1:9:42|[Lin Chong] suddenly stood up, instantly attracting countless eyes in the office. He quickly opened his phone and played a song.
1:9:57|1:10:4|On the screen, a song is being sung by [Liang Cong] as insects fly around.
1:10:19|1:10:27|[Lu Li] excitedly pounded [Lin Chong]'s chest a few times, then grabbed his shoulders and shook him hard.
1:10:34|1:10:40|He approached [Lu Xiaoxing], proudly thumping his chest, while [Lin Chong] frowned and propped up his chin.
1:10:52|1:11:9|[Lu Xiaoxing] held the lead rope with a lost look to the side. [Lin Chong] realized his mistake, the excitement disappearing completely, and nervously pursed his lips. After a moment of contemplation, he suddenly got up and gently took [Lu Xiaoxing]'s hand. [Lu Xiaoxing], feeling flustered, let go of the lead rope and stood up straight.
1:11:9|1:11:15|[Lin Chong] bent over, holding [Lu Xiaoxing]'s hand with one hand behind his back, looking sincerely into [Lu Xiaoxing]'s eyes.
1:11:18|1:11:26|[Lu Xiaoxing] stood facing [Lin Chong] blankly, not knowing what he was up to. At night, [Lin Chong] took [Lu Xiaoxing] to an outdoor roller skating rink and taught her how to skate.
1:12:0|1:12:9|As if infected by Lin Chong's emotions, Lu Xiaoxing also showed a rare smile. The two of them skated leisurely hand in hand in the roller skating rink, with the lights above swirling in the air like stars.
1:12:9|1:12:17|[Lu Xiaoxing] is not proficient in roller skating. From time to time, she stumbles forward, but it doesn't affect her rare moment of relaxation.
1:12:28|1:12:42|A man walked slowly into the basement, where two girls lay unconscious on the hospital bed with IV drips. One of the girls, dressed in a white dress, had her limbs tied to the bed and her face was covered with lines drawn by a plastic surgeon.
1:13:44|1:13:50|The man bent down to turn his sister over and cradled her head, only to find a large bloodstain on the back of her head. He shook his sister's body in panic.
1:13:54|1:14:16|A man in the basement walks slowly towards the girl in the projection, looking at her obsessively. He recalls the scene of that rainy night when he was lying on the ground crying with his sister in his arms. Looking up at the girl in the photo wearing a white dress and smiling brightly, the man's expression reveals endless memories. That night, he sat on the ground holding his sister's body for a long time, the weather mirroring his mood.
1:14:16|1:14:33|The sky has never cleared. It is still night. Lu Xiaoxing stands in front of the French window, looking quietly outside. After a long time, he turns around and walks slowly towards the desk. He casually opens the drawer, inside of which there are more than ten identical mobile phones, and in the corner, there are also more than ten scattered SIM cards.
1:14:33|1:14:54|A man randomly took out a mobile phone and inserted a SIM card, then pressed the power button expressionlessly. The screen illuminated his gloomy face, and he proceeded to install an app on the phone. At the same time, [Jingkuang] was still sitting in front of the computer at the police station, and the new ID of this guy had already logged in. [Lu Li] immediately rushed to the screen.
1:15:6|1:15:9|A taxi pulled up in front of the villa where [Lu Xiaoxing] used to live.
1:15:9|1:15:26|After getting off the car, [Lu Xiaoxing] hesitantly reached out and grabbed [Lin Chong]'s arm. As [Lin Chong] led [Lu Xiaoxing] forward, he curiously looked up at the luxurious villa, while [Lu Li] drove the car swiftly on the road with [Jingkuang]. He hung up the phone and looked at [Lu Li].
1:15:44|1:15:59|[Lin Chong] cautiously pushed open the big door, finding it dark inside. He supported [Lu Xiaoxing] as they walked slowly into the hall, while [Lu Xiaoxing] felt the wall and turned on all the lights in the room. [Lin Chong] was amazed when he saw the full view of the villa, his mouth wide open in astonishment, looking around like a curious baby.
1:16:4|1:16:19|[Lu Xiaoxing] felt the wall, slowly climbed the spiral staircase on the side, while [Lin Chong] excitedly walked into the living room, threw himself onto the sofa, patted the firm cushion, and then turned over to lie on the other side, stretching his arms in a very relaxed manner.
1:16:19|1:16:26|[Lu Xiaoxing] then came to [Liang Cong]'s room and searched for something. When she touched [Liang Cong]'s photo frame, she smiled with relief.
1:16:26|1:16:44|Later, she found the ukulele placed in the middle of the cabinet, took it down and held it in her arms, gently stroking it. [Lin Chong] flipped over the photo frame on the table, inside was a family photo of [Lu Xiaoxing] and her family of four.
1:16:48|1:17:11|[Lin Chong] suddenly frowned and leaned in to look at [Liang Cong] in the photo. He immediately picked up another frame on the table and turned to look at the photo on the wall. [Lu Xiaoxing] held the ukulele and forced a smile. She led [Lin Chong] to the basement, excitement and joy shining in his eyes.
1:17:14|1:17:23|[Lin Chong] ran down the stairs excitedly and stood in the center of the basement, looking around. The walls were covered with band posters, and in front of him was a drum set.
1:17:28|1:17:31|[Lin Chong] excitedly tapped out a rhythm and then looked at [Lu Xiaoxing] with a smile.
1:17:31|1:17:44|[Lu Xiaoxing] looked melancholic, standing quietly by the stairs. Upon seeing this, [Lin Chong] quickly set aside the drumstick and stood in front of [Liang Cong], lighting three incense sticks and bowing respectfully three times towards the photo of [Liang Cong].
1:18:10|1:18:19|[Lin Chong] looked at [Lu Xiaoxing] with concern, unable to respond for a moment. At this moment, [Lu Li] and [Jingkuang] also arrived at the Fuhua Mountain Villa. A single street lamp illuminated the entrance of the villa.
1:18:19|1:18:33|Appearing particularly eerie, [Lu Li] and [Jingkuang] got out of the car and looked cautiously towards the villa where everything seemed dark and deserted, as if no one had been there for a long time. The two of them skillfully climbed over the courtyard wall, leaped into the yard, and [Lu Li] rubbed his knee before pulling out a handgun from his pocket.
1:18:33|1:18:40|[Jingkuang] immediately took out a gun and looked around vigilantly, then took off the decorative frame and tucked it into his arms, following behind [Lu Li].
1:18:40|1:18:55|Lu Li and Lu Xiaoxing silently sneaked into the villa, with Lu Li cautiously knocking on the window lattice in the central hall. Liang Cong immediately hid in a corner of the corridor, while Lu Li raised a flashlight to investigate the situation.
1:18:55|1:19:17|[Jingkuang] followed closely behind, holding a flashlight in his left hand and a gun in his right hand, cautiously surveying the surroundings with a crouched posture. Suddenly, [Lu Li] turned around and nodded at him, [Jingkuang] nodded in agreement, then turned to check the other side. [Lu Li] took a few more steps forward, scanning a row of bookshelves. The bookshelves were filled with Tang Zheng's trophies and photos. [Lu Li] reached out and picked up a photo frame, showing a pair of siblings aged seven or eight, both holding up a trophy. He furrowed his brow and examined it closely for a long time.
1:19:17|1:19:32|Carefully placing the photo frame back in its original position, on the other side, [Jingkuang] arrived at a staircase leading downwards. He used a flashlight to scan the surroundings continuously, carefully stepping down the stairs. Soon, the large iron door of the basement came into view. [Jingkuang] held the flashlight in his mouth, cautiously unlocking it.
1:19:32|1:19:56|At this moment, [Lu Li] quietly pushed open a door, walking forward cautiously with a flashlight scanning around. Suddenly, he stared in one direction for a while, fumbling to turn on the switch. The light came on, [Lu Li] frowned and scanned around, his gaze fixed ahead. In front of him was a Golf 6. [Lu Li] relaxed his brows, couldn't help but raise the corners of his mouth. He opened a cabinet and a pile of license plates fell out.
1:19:58|1:20:13|[Lu Li] focused on the license plate, waved his hand backwards, the figure behind did not argue, and walked slowly towards [Lu Li]. Suddenly, [Lu Li] sensed something was wrong, he turned around to see Tang Zheng, [Lu Li] just stood up and was kicked to the wall by Tang Zheng. [Lu Li] raised his gun, but was subdued by Tang Zheng again and hit the wall once more.
1:20:13|1:20:20|Soon after, Tang Zheng threw [Lu Li] to the ground.
1:20:23|1:20:32|[Lu Li] took a wrench from Tang Zheng, hugged his waist tightly, and was pushed several meters away by Tang Zheng before pouncing on him again. [Lu Li] then seized Tang Zheng's arm and performed a shoulder throw.
1:20:32|1:20:55|He lunged at Tang Zheng and wrestled with him again, even breaking the beads. Tang Zheng, unwilling to show weakness, flipped over and threw a punch at [Lu Li]. [Lu Li] blocked with one hand and forcefully pressed Tang Zheng against the shelf. Tang Zheng flipped him over fiercely to the other side, then grabbed a piece of chain, put it around [Lu Li]'s neck, and yanked it back. [Lu Li] instantly couldn't breathe, frantically spinning around the shelf.
1:20:55|1:21:6|The structure suddenly collapsed, trapping Tang Zheng underneath. [Lu Li] gasped for breath, took off the iron chain around his neck, and pounced again. In desperation, Tang Zheng grabbed a wrench nearby and swung it at [Lu Li]'s knee, who endured the pain.
1:21:6|1:21:15|Lu Li grabbed the rushing Tang Zheng, pushed him down to the ground, lifted him up by the back of his clothes, made him kneel on the ground, and twisted his arm behind his back.
1:21:18|1:21:30|Unexpectedly, Tang Zheng suddenly pulled out a surgical knife and forcefully stabbed [Lu Li], causing fresh blood to gush out from his abdomen. Tang Zheng's face twisted with a hint of sadistic pleasure as [Lu Li] used all his strength to push Tang Zheng to the ground, before himself collapsing weakly on the ground.
1:21:30|1:21:40|Tang Zheng glared fiercely at [Lu Li], struggling to stand up. With blood all over his hands covering his arm, he walked up to [Lu Li], who was clutching his abdomen and trying to stay strong, gritting his teeth and staring at Tang Zheng.
1:21:40|1:21:58|As the sequelae of blood loss worsened, Lu Li's vision of Tang Zheng became increasingly blurred. Tang Zheng slowly squatted in front of Lu Li, his widened eyes looking terrifying. He stared straight at Lu Li without any disguise, with a twisted smile on his lips. Lu Li's eyes gradually became unfocused, and he could no longer support himself as his body slowly leaned back.
1:21:58|1:22:4|Tang Zheng's face became increasingly blurred, and finally Lu Li closed his eyes without any awareness and tilted his head to one side.
1:22:4|1:22:17|At this moment, [Jingkuang] was completely unaware of [Lu Li]'s situation. He finally unlocked the iron chain, pushed open the iron door, and rushed into the basement. Inside, it was pitch black with extremely low visibility. [Jingkuang] held a gun in one hand and a flashlight in the other, cautiously moving closer with his body turned sideways.
1:22:17|1:22:26|Upon seeing three girls lying on the hospital bed with their faces wrapped like zongzi, [Jingkuang] cautiously approached to feel their pulses, then he raised the flashlight and scanned the surroundings vigilantly.
1:22:26|1:22:49|Suddenly, a green button in the corner of the wall caught his attention. When [Jingkuang] tentatively pressed it, the sound of mechanical operation rang in his ears, and a secret door unexpectedly opened. As he looked closer, what he saw left him dumbfounded - three girls with unclear consciousness were sitting in the dark secret room, all connected to IV drips. In the middle, there was a photo frame, and upon closer inspection, he realized that the three girls looked exactly like Tang Qian in the photo frame.
1:22:58|1:23:13|[Lin Chong] picked up [Liang Cong]'s ukulele from the sofa, holding it and smiling as he walked outside. At that moment, [Lu Xiaoxing] was sitting on a chair next to a sculpture. Upon hearing the music, she couldn't help but sit up straight.
1:24:0|1:24:13|[Lin Chong] sat next to [Lu Xiaoxing], playing the guitar inside the car. The sudden vibration of the phone interrupted their moment, [Lin Chong] placed the guitar on the floor and took out the phone with a look of surprise.
1:24:18|1:24:41|[Lin Chong] and [Lu Xiaoxing] exchanged a smile before quickly replying to the message. Meanwhile, [Lu Li]'s phone was in Tang Zheng's hand. With one hand on the steering wheel, he looked at the phone screen with a smile. There was also a black bucket on the front passenger seat. Once he got the exact location, Tang Zheng's smile became even more reckless. He casually threw [Lu Li]'s phone out of the window as he drove away, leaving dust behind. At the same time, the police and ambulances had arrived at Fuhua Villa.
1:24:58|1:25:24|At this moment, with heavy rain pouring down, a series of footprints appeared inside the Blue Lake Villa. The footprints led all the way to the center of the living room, carrying a large amount of mud and sand that was completely incompatible with the luxurious marble floor. Following the footprints to the end, only a pair of black leather shoes standing against the wall could be seen. Gently placing down a black bucket, he held a music box with a ballet dancer in his left hand, and with his right hand, he uncovered the piano keys under the white cloth. At this moment, Lu Xiaoxing felt her way into the living room, reaching for the edge of the sofa and then feeling her way down to find her handbag.
1:25:24|1:25:46|Upon hearing the piano playing, Lu Xiaoxing carefully stood up and walked towards the piano, unaware that her bag suddenly opened and her phone slipped onto the carpet. Tang Zheng sat in front of the piano, expressionless, pressing the keys as Lin Chong. Lu Li felt the wall and slowly walked towards the piano.
1:25:52|1:25:58|Tang Zheng played with the music box without turning around, and [Lu Xiaoxing] nervously took a step back.
1:26:21|1:26:36|[Lu Xiaoxing] frowned, lost in thought. [Tang Zheng] nodded knowingly, stood up, and [Lu Xiaoxing] hastily took several steps back upon hearing movement. [Tang Zheng] walked towards [Lu Xiaoxing], who stumbled when stepping back due to [Jingkuang].
1:26:58|1:27:3|[Lin Chong] inadvertently walked into the living room and pounced on [Tang Zheng], only to be thrown aside.
1:27:12|1:27:33|[Lu Xiaoxing] hurriedly felt her way upstairs, [Tang Zheng] angrily grabbed [Lin Chong] by the collar and punched him to the ground. Turning towards [Lu Xiaoxing], [Lin Chong] in a panic, recklessly tackled [Tang Zheng] to the ground, blocking the staircase. [Tang Zheng] grabbed [Lin Chong] by the collar and threw him onto the bar counter. [Lu Xiaoxing] reached the sofa and frantically reached for her bag, but couldn't find her phone. She anxiously searched on the floor, only to realize her phone had fallen in a different direction.
1:27:33|1:27:55|[Tang Zheng] once again took out the scalpel and stabbed into [Lin Chong]'s abdomen. He looked at [Lin Chong] ruthlessly, stabbing the knife further in. [Tang Zheng] was about to throw [Lin Chong] out, but to his surprise, [Lin Chong] found the strength to grab onto the knife with one hand and hold onto his shoulder with the other, not letting go. Enraged, [Tang Zheng] squeezed [Lin Chong]'s neck so hard that his eyes rolled back, then he threw [Lin Chong] aside like trash.
1:27:55|1:28:12|Crossing over, [Lin Chong] walked towards the stairs, his brows furrowed and his eyes barely open. Following him, [Tang Sengzheng] whistled as he leisurely ascended the spiral staircase. Hearing the noise, [Lu Xiaoxing] panicked and sat up straight. Instead of searching for her phone, she grabbed her shoulder bag and pulled out an alarm.
1:28:12|1:28:23|Shortly after, [Lu Xiaoxing] staggered to his feet and stumbled into [Liang Cong]'s room. Meanwhile, [Tang Zheng] had already walked into the living room. [Lu Xiaoxing] fumbled around on [Liang Cong]'s table, picked up a tuning fork, while [Tang Zheng] calmly walked to the sofa.
1:28:23|1:28:43|Picking up Lu Xiaoxing's phone, Lu Xiaoxing squatted by the wall and felt around. After finding the socket, she inserted the tuning fork into the socket, causing a short circuit. The room instantly plunged into darkness. Lu Xiaoxing hurriedly threw the tuning fork aside and crawled to the other side. Tang Zheng seemed pensive, looking around the dim surroundings and slowly turning to look at the stairs behind him.
1:28:43|1:28:54|[Lu Xiaoxing] was lying on the stairs with a bag slung over his shoulder. [Tang Zheng] slowly walked up the stairs and stood quietly next to the bag for a while. He looked around the dark surroundings again, and then took out a cigarette box from his pocket, unhurriedly.
1:28:54|1:29:8|He took out a cigarette, put it in his mouth, lit it with a lighter, took a puff, and didn't extinguish the lighter. Instead, he raised it and continued to walk slowly upwards. To Lu Xiaoxing, this cat-and-mouse game was the most interesting.
1:29:8|1:29:22|At this moment, [Lu Xiaoxing] crouched in a dark area, carefully listening to the sounds outside, while [Tang Zheng] stepped onto the last step quietly, holding a cigarette in one hand and a lighter in the other. He casually strolled in the corridor.
1:29:22|1:29:38|Soon, [Tang Zheng] found his position and took a deep breath before throwing himself to the ground. He walked straight towards [Liang Cong]'s bedroom, each step powerful as if deliberately reminding [Lu Xiaoxing]. Sensing [Tang Zheng]'s approach, [Lu Xiaoxing] stood at the room's doorway with a lighter in hand.
1:29:38|1:29:46|He first looked around, then leisurely strolled into [Liang Cong]'s bedroom, where the furnishings could be vaguely seen in the moonlight.
1:29:46|1:30:3|[Tang Zheng] took a few steps forward, holding up a lighter to carefully scan the bedroom with the light. Suddenly, his gaze stopped at the window. [Tang Zhen] expressionless, walked to the window and extinguished the lighter. He abruptly opened the window and looked down. Seizing this opportunity, [Lu Xiaoxing] quietly pushed open the wardrobe door and moved to the doorway.
1:30:3|1:30:17|At this moment, Tang Zheng was unaware of what was happening behind him. He casually took out Lu Xiaoxing's phone from his pocket and threw it out of the window. Lu Xiaoxing took the opportunity to slip out of Liang Cong's bedroom, feeling her way along the wall and hurriedly walking forward. Tang Zheng closed the window and turned around thoughtfully.
1:30:17|1:30:35|While [Lu Xiaoxing] was walking in the corridor, the route in her mind appeared, and suddenly a man's shadow appeared near the door in her mind, causing her to stagger back several steps in fear. The sound behind her suddenly made her turn her head alertly. At this moment, Tang Zheng was pushing open the wardrobe door and holding up a lighter to check inside.
1:30:35|1:30:41|[Lu Xiaoxing] seemed to feel the fire in front of her, and the man in front of her disappeared. She gathered her courage and continued to walk forward.
1:30:41|1:30:53|A long trail of blood cuts across half of the living room. [Lin Chong] is gasping for breath as he crawls desperately forward. His phone is placed on the coffee table not far ahead. [Lin Chong] looks on in despair, then collapses weakly to the ground.
1:30:53|1:31:3|Tang Zhen pushed open a sliding door, stopped at the doorway to investigate, and suddenly the alarm sound made Tang Zheng's face change instantly. He looked fierce and ran towards the direction of the alarm.
1:31:3|1:31:15|After circling around the huge villa for several rounds, he finally arrived at the location of the alarm. He saw an alarm device plugged next to the bathtub, and [Lu Xiaoxing], who had set up the alarm, quietly slipped out of the bathroom. Tang Zheng had just pulled the alarm device off the edge of the bathtub.
1:31:15|1:31:34|[Lu Xiaoxing] pushed a cabinet from outside, blocking the bathroom door. Tang Zheng then realized this and angrily smashed the alarm, trying to open the bathroom door. The door was firmly blocked by a shelf outside, making it impossible to kick the door open for a while. Xiaoxing hurriedly searched downstairs. At this moment, [Jingkuang] rushed into the garage of Fuhua Mountain Villa and finally saw the unconscious [Lu Li].
1:31:57|1:32:4|[Lin Chong] lay unconscious in front of the coffee table, while [Lu Xiaoxing] fumbled her way to the French window to open it, only to find that Tang Zheng had already tied an iron chain on it.
1:32:4|1:32:20|Tang Zheng was still angrily kicking the door, unable to come out. [Lu Xiaoxing] groped his way up the stairs to try to open the main door, only to find that the main door was also tightly locked by Tang Zheng. With each kick, the structure outside gradually loosened, and soon he could stick out half of his head.
1:32:46|1:33:9|The police car roared towards the home of [Lu Xiaoxing], [Lu Xiaoxing] anxiously felt around and suddenly tripped over something, falling to the ground. She reached out and touched [Lin Chong]'s body, [Lu Xiaoxing] was shocked and quickly pressed her cheek against [Lin Chong]. Tang Zheng, sweating profusely from pushing the door open, exerted all his strength to push the shelf out a bit more. Finally, he squeezed out of the bathroom and rushed outside. [Lu Xiaoxing] struggled to lift [Lin Chong]'s upper body with all her strength, while Tang Zheng circled around several times.
1:33:9|1:33:32|Just as they reached the staircase, [Lu Xiaoxing] struggled to drag the unconscious [Lin Chong] towards the staircase. Tang Zhen's footsteps were getting closer, and [Lu Xiaoxing] managed to drag [Lin Chong] to a room near the staircase. When Tang Zheng saw the two of them, he hesitated for a moment, then his expression turned even more sinister. He quickened his pace, but [Lu Xiaoxing] managed to put [Lin Chong] aside and crawled towards the door. She blocked Tang Zheng on the other side of the room just before he pounced. Tang Seng, unable to catch [Lu Xiaoxing], angrily pounded on the door.
1:33:40|1:33:46|[Lin Chong]'s phone rang again. Tang Zheng walked to the coffee table, picked up the phone and slammed it to the ground. At this moment, [Lu Xiaoxing] knelt beside [Lin Chong], trembling as she tried to give [Lin Chong] mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
1:33:48|1:33:57|[Lin Chong] suddenly felt a dampness on his fingertips, and when he sniffed it, he was shocked. He quickly crawled to the shelf and took out the first aid kit.
1:33:57|1:34:11|Lu Xiaoxing took out a white bottle from the middle, opened it and sniffed carefully. Just as Lin Chong was giving medicine to Lu Li, Tang Zheng outside picked up a golf club and ruthlessly swung at the door lock. Tang Zheng swung the club with full force, hitting the door lock again and again, leaving Lu Xiaoxing unable to move for a moment.
1:34:12|1:34:26|The door lock was knocked open, Tang Zheng kicked open the door, looked down at the room with a fierce face, and stepped into the room slowly. He held a pool cue in one hand and took out a lighter in the other hand, but this time he struck it several times and still couldn't produce a flame.
1:34:26|1:34:48|Tang Zheng cautiously walked forward, closing the lighter lid. He held the baseball bat in the most handy position and carefully surveyed the room, but couldn't see the figures of the two people. So Tang Zheng's gaze stopped at the curtain. He pursed his lips, stepped forward, and pulled open the curtain. There was nothing behind the curtain. Suddenly, [Lu Xiaoxing] emerged from beside the bookshelf, holding a pair of scissors.
1:34:49|1:34:59|[Lu Xiaoxing] tightly held the scissors, looking confusedly ahead and waving them around. This scene piqued Tang Seng's interest, as he stood beside [Lu Xiaoxing] and lightly tapped her shoulder with a baseball bat.
1:34:59|1:35:5|Panic-stricken, Lu Xiaoxing thrusts towards Tang Zheng, one hand tightly gripping the bookshelf behind him, while Tang Zheng pokes at the other side of Lu Xiaoxing's shoulder with a baseball bat.
1:35:5|1:35:16|[Lu Xiaoxing] panickedly waved the scissors and felt her way back against the wall, while Tang Zhenzheng noticed [Lin Chong] hidden behind the bookshelf. His brows suddenly furrowed as if he was about to wake up, and Tang Zhenzheng forced [Lu Xiaoxing] into the living room.
1:35:16|1:35:35|From time to time, [Lu Xiaoxing] would tap on the wall to provoke [Lin Chong]. Suddenly, he threw the pool cue aside and rushed forward to grab [Lu Xiaoxing]'s hand, then he grabbed her neck from behind. [Lu Xiaoxing] twisted his hand, threw [Tang Zheng] over his shoulder and knocked him to the ground. While [Tang Zheng] was still trying to get up, [Lu Xiaoxing] hurriedly felt her way to the bar, then she picked up the iron bucket on the bar and turned towards the other side.
1:35:35|1:35:44|[Tang Zheng]'s originally injured arm was hurting even more, and it took him a while to struggle to get up before quickly catching up.
1:35:50|1:36:2|[Lu Xiaoxing] lit a match and held it up in front of [Tang Zheng], the iron bucket continuously pouring out liquid, causing [Tang Zheng] to be truly shocked and terrified. [Lu Xiaoxing] raised the match forward, leaving [Tang Zheng] frozen in place, never expecting the entire bucket of gasoline to be poured over himself.
1:36:2|1:36:8|[Tang Zheng] chuckled self-deprecatingly, [Tang Zheng] grinned and looked at [Lu Xiaoxing].
1:36:22|1:36:27|[Tang Zheng] looked angrily at the gasoline dripping on [Lu Xiaoxing], he took a few steps back and gently raised his toes.
1:36:35|1:36:56|[Tang Zheng] helplessly reached into his pocket and accidentally kicked a drum set in the distance. He turned his eyes to [Lu Xiaoxing], who held the key in front of her and shook it gently. [Lu Xiaoxing] tilted her head to carefully discern the direction. Suddenly, [Tang Zheng] threw the key far away. [Lu Xiaoxing] hurried to grab the key, holding a match in one hand and fumbling for direction with the other. As the match burned down to the end...
1:36:59|1:37:18|When the match lit up again, [Tang Zheng] raised the drum rack and smashed it towards [Lu Xiaoxing], only to hit the glass in front of him. The match in [Lu Xiaoxing]'s hand fell to the ground in the chaos, and the fire slowly spread. It caught [Tang Zheng]'s arm, and [Lu Xiaoxing] hurriedly searched on the ground, quickly finding the key. By this time, flames had engulfed [Tang Zheng]'s whole body, and he struggled in the fire without time to care for [Lu Xiaoxing].
1:37:18|1:37:24|[Lu Xiaoxing] groped her way up the stairs, leaving behind a photo of [Liang Cong] that seemed to bless her from beyond.
1:37:24|1:37:36|The sprinkler quickly started spraying water, easing the fire. [Lu Xiaoxing] rushed out of the basement in a panic and locked the door. Walking along the wall, [Tang Zheng] suddenly emerged from the fire scene and caught up with [Lu Xiaoxing] in just a few steps, grabbing her clothes from behind.
1:37:36|1:37:59|He forcefully threw her onto the nearby bar counter. Tang Zhen's half face was severely burned by the fire, looking terrifying. He staggered forward and dragged [Lu Xiaoxing] up, slapping her down to the ground. Relentlessly, he continued to beat [Lu Xiaoxing] without mercy, causing her to crash into the glass, fall to the ground. Tang Zheng, with his burnt wrist, stumbled and collapsed by the piano. [Lu Xiaoxing] struggled to prop herself up and slowly crawled outward.
1:37:59|1:38:11|Tang Zheng once again became crazy, he stared infatuatedly at the music box on the piano, and after a long time, he tremblingly reached out his hand, carefully touching the protective cover. He slowly picked up the music box and walked menacingly towards [Lu Xiaoxing].
1:38:11|1:38:22|At this moment, [Lu Xiaoxing] was still struggling to climb outward with both arms, Tang Zheng held the music box in front of his eyes, watching the slowly moving [Lu Xiaoxing] through the music and protective cover. His expression was distracted, showing signs of mental collapse.
1:38:22|1:38:38|[Lu Xiaoxing] reached out her hands to feel and crawl, suddenly touching the vibrating guide cane her mother bought for her. But at this moment, Tang Zheng had already stood behind [Lu Xiaoxing]. He half-knelt beside her, firmly pressing her shoulders, effortlessly flipping her over and pinching her neck.
1:38:43|1:38:47|Tang Zheng, with a crazy expression, has already mistaken Lu Xiaoxing for his sister Tang Qian.
1:38:55|1:39:15|[Lu Xiaoxing] was choked and couldn't breathe. His expression was scattered, Tang Zheng stared at [Lu Xiaoxing] tightly, his grip tightened, [Lu Xiaoxing] weakly raised his hand and pounded Tang Zheng's chest a few times. Then he furrowed his brow, closed his eyes tightly, and suddenly Tang Zheng tilted his head to one side, with [Lin Chong] standing behind him holding a baseball bat tightly. He held his abdomen in pain and helped [Lu Xiaoxing] to the edge of the bar.
1:39:18|1:39:24|[Lu Xiaoxing] opened her eyes dazedly, and [Lin Chong] placed her hand on his own face.
1:39:27|1:39:32|[Lu Xiaoxing] hurriedly took out a bunch of keys from his pocket and stuffed them into [Lin Chong]'s hand.
1:39:34|1:39:47|[Lin Chong] looked at the key in his hand in astonishment, then glanced at the floor-to-ceiling window. Lowering his head, he placed one of [Lu Xiaoxing]'s hands on his shoulder, turned around, and walked towards the window. With the key in hand, he quickly unlocked the iron chain with a few clicks.
1:39:49|1:40:8|Come on, [Lin Chong] helped [Lu Xiaoxing], who was almost unconscious, to get up. But they found Tang Zheng struggling to stand up. [Lin Chong] hurriedly helped [Lu Xiaoxing] up and pushed open the French window to run outside. Tang Zheng, with his hand on the wall, roared and lunged towards the French window. [Lin Chong] quickly turned back to close the window, but was pushed aside by Tang Zheng. [Lu Xiaoxing] was thrown onto a nearby table, and [Lin Chong] and Tang Zheng fell into the swimming pool.
1:40:16|1:40:20|[Lin Chong] got up and lunged at Tang Zheng again, who grabbed [Lin Chong]'s arm and threw him into the rain.
1:40:37|1:40:45|On the other side, [Liang Cong] and [Lu Xiaoxing] were tied up in the car, screaming helplessly, as if they were back at the scene of the car accident years ago.
1:40:58|1:41:11|[Lu Xiaoxing] stood up with one hand on the ground, as if it were the same posture from when she forced herself up after the car accident years ago. [Lu Xiaoxing] walked a few steps forward, supporting her forehead, before falling down again in a daze.
1:41:11|1:41:27|But she didn't give up, still struggling to crawl forward, [Lu Xiaoxing]'s hand groping on the ground, suddenly touching the ukulele she bought for [Liang Cong]. This seemed to give [Lu Xiaoxing] endless strength, she held the ukulele tightly in her arms and stood up again with great effort.
1:41:34|1:41:47|Tang Zheng seemed tireless as he lifted [Lin Chong] out of the water and punched him in the face repeatedly. Meanwhile, in her memory, [Lu Xiaoxing] walked to the front of the car, with [Liang Cong] placing both hands on the passenger seat handle, her eyes still filled with fear and despair.
1:41:47|1:42:2|[Lu Xiaoxing] looked at her brother in the car with tears streaming down her face, trembling as she reached out her hand to gently touch the window. With the other hand tightly gripping the handle, she desperately tried to pull the door open, but it wouldn't budge. She then started banging on the window, unsure of what else she could do.
1:42:2|1:42:12|At this moment, it seems that crying is the only thing she can do. She howls, unwillingly grabs the car door handle, but it still has no effect. She weakly taps on the car window, in pain and despair.
1:42:13|1:42:32|[Lin Chong] was thrown to the ground and then lunged at Tang Zheng's calf. Just as he had knocked Tang Zheng to the ground, he was kicked into the rainwater by Tang Zheng. [Lu Xiaoxing] was still immersed in memories. He helplessly lay by the car window, not knowing what to do. The memory of [Liang Cong] was still very clear, looking at her with tears in his eyes.
1:42:36|1:42:46|Since childhood, [Liang Cong] has always been encouraging him, and now, [Lu Xiaoxing] slowly stands up against the wall. He opens his eyes and sees the clear face of [Liang Cong] in his memory once again.
1:42:46|1:43:1|[Liang Cong] had no despair or panic in his eyes, only endless encouragement and gratitude. He nodded at [Lu Xiaoxing], as if telling her, "You can do it." His smile finally helped [Lu Xiaoxing] move on from the past, and she turned resolutely towards Tang Zheng.
1:43:6|1:43:26|Tang Zheng pushed [Lin Chong] into the water, then angrily walked towards [Lu Xiaoxing]. [Lin Chong] struggled in the water, trying to stop Tang Zheng, but he was too exhausted from earlier efforts and eventually fell weakly into the water. Tang Zheng walked out of the pool, took out a scalpel from his pocket, and quietly approached [Lu Xiaoxing], who was standing quietly next to a sculpture.
1:43:30|1:43:38|The surrounding noise was too loud, greatly affecting Lu Xiaoxing's judgment. She closed her eyes to determine Tang Zheng's direction.
1:43:41|1:43:52|With the vibration of the guide detector in her hand, [Lu Xiaoxing] already had Tang Zheng's exact location in her mind. The image of the man in front of her became clearer and clearer, as he slowly approached her with a grim expression.
1:43:52|1:44:9|[Lu Xiaoxing] still kept her eyes closed, listening attentively with her guide cane held tightly. The frequency of the vibrations from the guide cane increased, and at this moment, Tang Zheng couldn't contain his anger. He raised a surgical knife and ran towards her. The figure in his mind drew closer, and [Lu Xiaoxing] could clearly sense him rushing towards her with the knife raised. Suddenly, she opened her eyes wide.
1:44:9|1:44:24|With all her might, Lu Xiaoxing swung the ukulele, the man in her mind instantly turned into ashes, while in reality, Lu Xiaoxing knocked Tang Zheng unconscious. She relaxed and collapsed on the ground, and Lin Chong finally climbed out of the pool, relieved, and knelt down.
1:44:24|1:44:39|The siren sounded, Lu Xiaoxing knew she was saved. Several police cars with flashing lights rushed into the villa. Lu Xiaoxing couldn't help but lean back a little, while the mastermind Tang Zheng lay unconscious on the side, waiting for his just judgment.
1:44:39|1:44:56|Looking at [Lu Xiaoxing], [Lin Chong] smiled. The police successfully arrived at the scene, and both [Lu Xiaoxing] and [Lin Chong] were rescued.
1:44:58|1:45:3|This is a large concert scene, with a photo of [Liang Cong] displayed on the stage screen, and the organizer of the concert standing on the stage.
1:45:4|1:45:11|They are all former band members of [Liang Cong], with glow sticks waving in the audience holding banners and signs with the band's name on stage.
1:45:48|1:46:5|The stage lights suddenly flickered, the rhythm changed, making the originally gentle atmosphere instantly lively. The stage background suddenly turned into a sky full of stars, with the audience below in a dark mass, only able to see the glow sticks of the fans flickering, while the guitarist skillfully strummed the strings.
1:46:5|1:46:15|The banners in the audience are filled with "I love you, North Star". At this moment, a figure in black walks onto the stage, and the whole venue falls silent.
