0:2:22|0:2:29|The henchmen obediently reversed the car slowly, and stopped at the roadside upon seeing the gesture from [Zhang Hua]. [Zhang Hua] got out of the car with a walkie-talkie in hand.
0:5:16|0:5:45|[Zhang Hua] smiled without saying a word. Knowing that the people around him were kidnappers, [Mr. Wu] remained calm and thoughtful. The car sped towards the outskirts on the highway at 1 am. 18 hours and 20 minutes after the incident, [Zhang Hua] was arrested. In the police station, two deputy captains, [Xing Feng] and [Cao Gang], were interrogating [Zhang Hua].
0:6:30|0:6:55|Cao Gang finished speaking and patted Zhang Hua's shoulder as if to remind him. Zhang Hua fell silent for a moment and then calmly nodded. The hand behind him, clenched into a fist and turning purple, slowly opened. He then stared at the monitor with a deadpan expression and asked, "Captain Zhang Guozheng and Deputy Captain Li Jiehui on the other end of the monitor are watching the interrogation room with serious expressions. But even the experienced duo are at a loss when faced with the uncooperative Zhang Hua."
0:6:56|0:7:3|The detective next to the monitor looked at [Zhang Hua] and said,
0:8:44|0:8:49|The detective in the monitoring room carefully laid out the weapons from the bag one by one.
0:8:56|0:9:5|After speaking, he sighed and lowered his head when he saw the look in Captain's eyes.
0:9:43|0:10:2|[Zhang Hua] frowned as he recalled the situation in the car that night. The driver's henchmen kept overtaking, causing everyone in the car to sway and struggle to breathe. [Mr. Wu] asked,
0:10:36|0:10:50|[Zhang Hua] thought for a moment, unrelated to saving people, and then openly recalled. Twenty days before the incident, at the China-Russia border, [Zhang Hua] and an informant were waiting by the river for a Russian arms dealer. Soon, two Russian men came down from a off-road vehicle.
0:11:0|0:11:7|The arms dealer became suspicious when he saw Mr. Wu being so happy.
0:11:24|0:11:46|To prove to the arms dealer, [Zhang Hua] took out a dagger and stabbed it into the arm of the captive. The arms dealer was stunned by this sight and quickly agreed to the demands, allowing [Zhang Hua] to pick up the weapon. After spraying gunfire with a machine gun, he then threw a hand grenade into the icy lake, watching as the water column shot up into the sky.
0:11:46|0:11:59|[Zhang Hua] praised in Russian with just one sentence, [Zhang Hua] drove away satisfied after the deal, while the informant sitting in the back seat was pale and barely breathing.
0:12:45|0:12:51|Realizing that he had let slip a secret, [Mr. Wu]...
0:13:49|0:13:58|Faced with such intense questioning, [Zhang Hua] who let slip a secret couldn't come up with a good strategy for a moment. After pondering for a while, he smiled and said to the three serious captains,
0:13:59|0:14:8|The narration then begins to recount the kidnapping of Xiao Dou. The day before the incident, a group led by [Zhang Hua] disguised themselves as police officers and intercepted Xiao Dou, who was driving a sports car.
0:15:1|0:15:7|[Xing Feng] walked towards the door, and the time on the wall was already 8:03 in the evening.
0:15:16|0:15:40|The captain, who is skilled in psychological warfare, left after saying this. After the captain left, Guozi placed a box of hot dumplings in front of [Zhang Hua]. [Xing Feng] also walked up behind him, unlocked the handcuffs on his back, pulled [Zhang Hua]'s numb arm to the front, and faced with [Zhang Hua] who had no way to escape, [Xing Feng] still cautiously handcuffed his hands in front, and after opening the lid, said to [Zhang Hua],
0:15:52|0:16:0|Without blinking an eye, Mr. Wu stared at [Zhang Hua] for a long time. Just as Xing Feng walked out of the interrogation room, Guo Zi caught up and said,
0:16:10|0:16:16|Cao Gang in the monitoring room closely watches every move of Zhang Hua.
0:16:17|0:16:22|At this moment, [Zhang Hua] in the control room suddenly looked up at the monitor with his mouth half open, as if wanting to say something.
0:16:29|0:16:46|The eagerly anticipating crowd became even more nervous when [Zhang Hua] did not disclose any details of the case. It seemed like [Zhang Hua], who was teasing the police, was about to put a dumpling in his mouth but missed, dropping it on the ground. After a moment of confusion, [Zhang Hua] recalled what happened 45 minutes after the incident.
0:16:52|0:17:0|Finally arrived at a deserted courtyard, [Zhang Hua] couldn't help but laugh when looking at [Mr. Wu], then asked Da Wei who was left behind.
0:17:20|0:17:30|Dawei and Xiaolei led [Mr. Wu] into the cabin, chatting as they walked.
0:20:13|0:20:20|Mr. Wu, with tears in his eyes, tried to save Xiao Dou in a kind-hearted manner. After hearing this, Zhang Hua looked at Mr. Wu sharply for a long time before saying,
0:20:46|0:20:52|After seeing Cangzi slowly raise his hand, Mr. Wu, with veins bulging on his forehead, finally breathed a sigh of relief.
0:21:14|0:21:21|[Mr. Wu] stared firmly into [Zhang Hua]'s eyes, and after a moment, [Zhang Hua] helped [Mr. Wu] onto the bed as if in agreement.
0:21:25|0:21:45|His men instinctively helped the flushed Xiao Dou up and removed the wire from his neck. [Mr. Wu] struggled to sit up from the bed, comforting Xiao Dou by patting his head, worried that the commotion just now might attract passersby. Cao Gang went out with a machine gun to patrol the area.
0:21:45|0:21:50|On the other side, the police found the vehicle they used during the kidnapping through surveillance footage from the traffic department.
0:22:0|0:22:7|And in the police station, Chief Cheng immediately recognized [Zhang Hua] in the criminal records database, pointing at the screen excitedly.
0:22:47|0:22:58|[Zhang Hua] agreed to [Mr. Wu]'s request. As the younger brother was struggling with handcuffs, [Mr. Wu] also took into account what Xiao Dou had said, but this level of comfort seemed minimal to Xiao Dou, who had already been beaten.
0:25:43|0:26:4|[Zhang Hua] kept turning the pistol in his hand while deep in thought. After considering it carefully, he asked, and upon learning of [Mr. Wu]'s whereabouts, [Zhang Hua] drove alone to his destination. Meanwhile, [Cao Gang] and Cheng rushed to [Mr. Wu]'s apartment.
0:26:30|0:26:53|With his head down, [Mr. Wu] suddenly looked up at the innocent Xiao Dou. Without saying a word, [Mr. Wu] coughed in the corridor, catching the attention of Cangzi playing cards. He walked in with a cola and a cup, and [Mr. Wu] cautiously said as he looked at the cola poured into the cup,
0:27:3|0:27:9|On this particularly cold winter day, [Mr. Wu] still nodded.
0:27:22|0:27:28|Dawei looked at the cola in his hand that he had just taken a sip of, feeling uncomfortable, he changed to a clean cup and started pumping well water.
0:27:59|0:28:24|At this moment, [Zhang Hua] in Mr. Wu's apartment carefully opened the bedroom door, cautiously entered the password for the safe. Meanwhile, [Cao Gang], with the unclear memory of the route, was wandering near the apartment. [Zhang Hua] took out two stacks of cash and a bank card from the safe.
0:28:27|0:28:38|[Cao Gang] was still spinning around non-stop, while [Zhang Hua] had already started drinking beer in the apartment, feeling very relaxed. At this moment, [Zhang Hua] began imitating the actions of [Mr. Wu] in the magazine.
0:29:7|0:29:36|[Zhang Hua] hung up the phone satisfactorily, picked up the DV on the table, and in [Mr. Wu]'s small cabin, Cangzi kicked the broken electric heater. David and Xiaolei also went to the yard to use the restroom. Unable to bear the cold in the cabin, Cangzi stood the machine gun by the cabinet, took out a screwdriver and started repairing it on the ground. Meanwhile, in the apartment, [Zhang Hua] was surprisingly interested in filming with the DV in the room. When he filmed the photo on the cabinet, he put down the DV in his hand.
0:29:37|0:29:42|He couldn't help but gasp at the group photo of [Mr. Wu] and his comrades.
0:29:42|0:30:6|At this moment, [Mr. Wu] sitting on the edge of the bed stared at the machine gun by the cabinet, as if planning something. He looked at the warehouse behind him, gently moving his body closer to the direction of the machine gun. When he was about to squat down to pick up the gun, he found his clothes being pulled. Turning around, he saw Xiao Dou tied to him, tightly holding onto his clothes. [Mr. Wu] carefully pushed Xiao Dou's hand away and gestured to him. Seeing Xiao Dou calm down a lot,
0:30:6|0:30:24|[Mr. Wu] slowly reached out towards the machine gun, but any slight movement would cause the iron chains bound to the two men to make noise. Looking at the warehouse where the electric heater was still being hammered, [Mr. Wu] gestured for Xiao Dou to come closer to him. Then, [Mr. Wu] gritted his teeth and reached out his hand, but he was still far away from the machine gun.
0:30:24|0:30:44|[Mr. Wu] held his breath again and tried several times, but facing a distance of less than a meter, the slight movement was of no avail. Seeing that the bunker was about to be repaired, knowing that he only had one chance, [Mr. Wu] suddenly sat on the ground and kicked the bottom of the machine gun with his foot, causing the machine gun to fall on [Mr. Wu]. [Mr. Wu] swiftly shot down the two gunmen who reacted.
0:30:44|0:30:56|Immediately aiming at the door, Da Wei, who had just rushed in, was shot and flew into the courtyard. Xiao Lei seized the opportunity when [Mr. Wu] was shooting and hit his shoulder. Then he leaned out and shot Xiao Dou, who was holding his head, dead.
0:30:56|0:31:18|But at this moment, a phone rang, interrupting Mr. Wu's reverie. Upon hearing the ring, Mr. Wu immediately withdrew his hand that was reaching for the gun, sat back in his original position on the ground, and took out two iron chains from the drawer, saying to Dawei and Xiaolei,
0:31:19|0:31:24|After wandering around for a while, [Cao Gang] arrived at the entrance of [Mr. Wu]'s apartment with the detective.
0:31:26|0:31:31|After finding nothing in the raid, the detective reported to [Cao Gang] about the landline in the apartment.
0:32:15|0:32:24|25 days before the incident, [Zhang Hua] and his gang arrived at the arcade and found Kong Lao Er, who was playing games.
0:34:20|0:34:34|Mr. Kong sat in the car at a loss, and then [Xing Feng] found the prison guard Yu Guohui with the recorded phone call. [Zhang Hua] returned to the cabin after getting the card.
0:35:12|0:35:35|[Zhang Hua] watched as [Mr. Wu], with his face flushed and veins bulging, gestured for Cangzi to release his grip. Xiao Dou, who was also holding onto Cangzi's hand, received a hard slap as a result. [Zhang Hua] smiled as he approached the breathless [Mr. Wu] lying on the bed, helping him up with the assistance of both of them. [Zhang Hua] took out the bank card from his pocket that he had retrieved from the safe, and said to [Mr. Wu],
0:35:46|0:35:51|Mr. Wu admitted when he realized he couldn't hide it anymore,
0:36:33|0:36:51|Upon hearing that a video was going to be recorded, the person sitting behind [Mr. Wu] quickly got up to avoid it. [Mr. Wu] remained silent at first, bowing his head. After a moment of silence, he spoke to the DV, but quickly changed the subject.
0:37:7|0:37:13|[Mr. Wu] took the DV camera and pretended to press a button before suddenly smashing it on the ground.
0:38:4|0:38:8|Mr. Wu's resolute gaze and tough attitude clearly intimidated the bandits.
0:38:8|0:38:27|After listening to Mr. Wu's emotional speech, Zhang Hua was at a loss for a moment. As the leader, he didn't know what to say after looking at his men. He pulled Mr. Wu and Xiao Dou, who had just been pushed onto the bed, up. Xiao Dou curled up timidly against Mr. Wu's shoulder. Mr. Wu, who had calmed down a bit, was afraid that Xing Feng would harm him.
0:38:27|0:38:34|Quickly shifting the focus to the money aspect, [Mr. Wu] said,
0:39:11|0:39:38|In an instant, Kong's henchmen and [Zhang Hua] were wrestling together. [Zhang Hua] was surprised that Mr. Kong, with a gun pointed at his head, was still resisting fiercely. When the two struggled for the gun, it accidentally went off and hit a pillar. While [Zhang Hua] was stunned, one of Kong's henchmen tackled him from behind. [Zhang Hua] and the henchman fled in panic, with Mr. Kong quickly chasing after them, memorizing the license plate number.
0:39:43|0:40:5|[Cao Gang] drove his car and violently crashed into the rear of [Zhang Hua]'s vehicle, causing the car to shatter against the railing, lose balance, and stop in the middle of the street. [Xing Feng] immediately got out of the car, pressed the escaping Xiao Lei against the police car. At this moment, [Zhang Hua] restarted the vehicle and recklessly rushed towards another street with no regard for traffic rules. [Xing Feng] was distracted by the vehicle, allowing Xiao Lei to break free from him. Xiao Lei agilely flipped over the fence in the middle of the road in an attempt to shake off [Xing Feng].
0:40:5|0:40:21|The driver who didn't have time to step on the brake quickly turned the steering wheel to the side, causing multiple cars to collide. Xiao Lei saw that [Xing Feng] was about to catch up with him, so he bravely crossed the road without fear of danger. Just as he was about to pass, he was hit and thrown to the ground by a passing truck that couldn't dodge in time. [Xing Feng] hurriedly stepped forward to stop the truck, arrested Xiao Lei, and called [Cao Gang].
0:40:31|0:40:42|The final smooth drift into an alleyway, even with such a tricky route, couldn't shake off the relentless pursuit of [Cao Gang]. Frustrated, [Zhang Hua] recklessly threw a grenade out of the window, regardless of the consequences.
0:40:44|0:40:52|With the explosion of the hand grenade, the raging fire instantly engulfed the entire alley. [Cao Gang], who had no hope of pursuit, quickly got out of the car and fired several shots ahead.
0:41:1|0:41:24|Fifteen days before the incident, the police arrested Qiangzi who had just come out of the hair salon. Qiangzi truthfully confessed his involvement in the process in the car. That night, the police captured Gangzi at the hotel.
0:41:34|0:41:48|Three hours after the incident, [Zhang Hua] called his comrade Mr. Wu using his phone. Mr. Wu answered the phone in a half-awake state.
0:42:1|0:42:10|Mr. Su, who was in a daze, suddenly woke up. He sat up in bed and asked,
0:42:53|0:43:8|After Mr. Wu, who understood the hint, was hung up on, he promptly picked up the landline and called the police. Moments later, Zhang Hua called Mr. Wu again.
0:43:41|0:43:49|Late at night, after [Zhang Hua] and the others fell asleep, [Mr. Wu] and Xiao Dou were chatting together.
0:44:26|0:44:33|In the drafty little house, the cold wind was piercing. Xiao Dou couldn't help but cough a few times.
0:46:21|0:46:43|[Zhang Hua] nodded slightly in admiration. As the few people in the cabin gradually fell asleep, the heart-pounding night slowly came to an end. The bustling city also quieted down in the cold air. Even at 7 o'clock in the morning, the entire city was still shrouded in darkness. [Xing Feng], who was waiting for the call from the kidnappers at Mr. Su's house, received a text message from his wife. The message read,
0:46:47|0:47:3|[Xing Feng] looked back without a reply, then put his phone in his pocket and continued to wait. Meanwhile, [Cao Gang], who was acting separately, woke up Wei Zi, who was sleeping on the table in the traffic monitoring center. Wei Zi, who was used to this rhythm, quickly got back to work.
0:47:12|0:47:18|Upon waking up, [Zhang Hua] looked at the poster of [Mr. Wu] on the wall and asked,
0:48:23|0:48:41|[Zhang Hua] smiled without saying a word after listening. The morning had not fully dawned yet, but the city's cleaners were already working in pairs to clean up the trash left by people the night before. As the scattered individuals on the bus gradually crowded together, a new day officially began. People rushed around the city's streets and alleys to go to work.
0:48:42|0:49:5|Some people enter high-rise buildings five days a week in an orderly manner, while others work year-round without a break, yet still open their shops on time, quietly waiting for customers to arrive. As these seemingly similar but different people busily go about their business, the city becomes lively again. Meanwhile, [Mr. Wu] and Xiao Dou are firmly chained to the bed, with light shining through the curtains onto the chains, making them appear particularly cold.
0:49:7|0:49:15|Mr. Wu, who had stayed up all night, pondered strategies and his gaze became somewhat vacant. At this moment, the alarm clock set for 8:30 on the bed broke the silence.
0:49:22|0:49:56|After being woken up by the alarm clock, the group of people got up and unlocked the iron chain on [Mr. Wu]. Xiao Dou noticed and asked about it. Then Da Wei tried to blindfold [Mr. Wu] from behind. Reluctantly cooperating, [Mr. Wu] had his eyes covered with a cloth and was taken to the car. Meanwhile, the police arrived at the bank early and deployed tightly around it. [Cao Gang] and others' car parked in the parking lot in front of the bank. They waited in the car for the right moment. On the tall building opposite the bank, ...
0:49:56|0:50:2|The sniper deployed by the armed police is focusing intently on the business van. The detective says to Mr. Su,
0:50:18|0:50:21|8 hours after the incident, [Mr. Wu] called the bank.
0:50:40|0:50:52|At this moment, Mr. Wu's car passed by a tractor, while Cao Gang and the sniper at the bank entrance kept looking around. The bank manager then said,
0:51:33|0:51:50|Blindfolded, [Mr. Wu] nearly hit a bridge pier. After adjusting his position, he felt uncomfortable all over and said to [Zhang Hua],
0:52:9|0:52:18|Mr. Wu heard a tractor passing by on the roadside and cleverly turned his head. Unable to continue, Zhang Hua, who had strong anti-surveillance abilities, pressed Mr. Wu against the bridge pier.
0:53:2|0:53:18|Mr. Su, who was full of anger, said. The tractor driver reported the situation to the police station on the side of the road. After Mr. Wu returned to the cabin, Zhang Hua said to Mr. Wu,
0:53:41|0:53:57|[Zhang Hua] fantasizes about a scene of robbing a bank vault. A large truck crashes through the door, and several masked men with machine guns in hand engage in a fierce gunfight with the security guards of the vault. The well-armed bandits ruthlessly slaughter the armed guards along the way, relentlessly advancing towards the vault door. After eliminating the last armed resistance, they bring the captured manager to the front of the vault door.
0:53:57|0:54:7|After threatening the two administrators with facial recognition, the gate was opened. After imagining it, [Zhang Hua] turned to [Mr. Wu] and said,
0:54:59|0:55:6|After driving the car to a slightly populated suburb, [Zhang Hua] got into a taxi parked by the roadside.
0:55:22|0:55:41|In the car, [Cao Gang] and other detectives were checking the bullets in their guns nervously. As the agreed time approached, the police officers surrounding the area were also anxiously observing their surroundings. At that moment, a taxi slowly stopped in front of the bank. All the police officers were highly focused, ready to rush towards the taxi at any moment to arrest [Zhang Hua].
0:55:42|0:55:56|The undercover police quickly loaded their pistols, and at this moment, [Mr. Su] in the car muttered to himself,
0:55:56|0:56:17|[Zhang Hua] opened the car door, the sniper kept his finger on the trigger, staring intently at the car door. But after a moment, the sniper took his finger off the trigger. The crowd looked down at the woman who got out of the car, sighed disappointedly, while [Zhang Hua] got out of the car outside the Shangdong Mall.
0:56:53|0:57:1|[Mr. Su] arrived at the Shangdong Mall as instructed and called [Zhang Hua].
0:57:9|0:57:15|Mr. Su, who is overweight, ignored the eyes of others and bent down to search on the ground.
0:57:31|0:57:38|After venting, Mr. Su subconsciously looked at the trash can, only to see an envelope with Mr. Su written on it underneath, containing Mr. Wu's identification and bank cards.
0:58:7|0:58:15|At this moment, the police car was being observed by Cangzi in the courtyard through a telescope. Before long, Dawei came back with a bag of apples.
0:58:37|0:58:44|On the other side, Mr. Su, who got his bank card at the bank, withdrew cash under the escort of the police according to the instructions.
0:59:16|0:59:22|12 hours after the incident, the police found Bozi in the massage parlor.
0:59:27|0:59:41|Bo heard that it was the police and ran away immediately. With a gas canister on his back, Bo, with his strong body, dashed through the crowd. However, he didn't run far before being tackled to the ground by the police.
1:0:1|1:0:13|Thirteen hours after the incident, [Mr. Wu], wrapped up tightly, boarded the bus with a backpack at the long-distance bus station. Just as [Mr. Wu] relaxed a bit, he tilted his head and saw the police on the bus next to him checking each passenger.
1:0:17|1:0:42|Coincidentally, [Xing Feng] noticed him. Uncertain, [Xing Feng] shouted loudly. Upon hearing this, [Mr. Wu] didn't hesitate and quickly ran forward. [Xing Feng] and the senior detective rushed from all directions. Seeing nowhere to escape, [Mr. Wu] desperately climbed over a nearly two-meter high wall onto the road. Agilely, [Xing Feng] also swiftly climbed over the wall and chased after [Mr. Wu]. Without any hesitation, [Mr. Wu] stepped on the roof of a car and then climbed over a tall fence. Seeing [Mr. Wu] accidentally fall,
1:0:42|1:0:56|[Xing Feng] quickly climbed up the fence, and at that moment, [Dongzi] pulled out a gun and aimed it at [Xing Feng] who was about to land. [Xing Feng] froze at the sight, but just as the situation was about to escalate, [Cao Gang] shot [Dongzi] in the arm. In the ambulance, [Cao Gang] asked the injured [Dongzi],
1:2:32|1:2:44|Police officers from the Public Security Bureau swarmed out in full force, dividing into dozens of teams to conduct continuous searches within the narrowed scope set by the authorities. The search area was reduced to a radius of 3 kilometers, but with the large number of people and vehicles in the city of Beijing, finding one person proved to be a challenging task.
1:2:45|1:2:52|Like finding a needle in a haystack. As time passed bit by bit, night fell once again over the city.
1:3:4|1:3:19|[Guo Zi] wandered around different neighborhoods for a while. Feeling a bit hungry, he bought a bread from the convenience store in the neighborhood, planning to eat while searching for his car. Just as he was about to open the door, he happened to see [Zhang Hua]'s car parked in the corner. After confirming, [Guo Zi]
1:4:26|1:4:43|Not long after, the area downstairs where [Zhang Hua] was located was filled with a large number of plainclothes police officers. Some were hiding in cars, some pretending to be passersby, and some pretending to be customers buying fruit. But no matter what their identity was, everyone kept an eye on [Zhang Hua]'s vehicle. [Xing Feng] called and asked,
1:5:16|1:5:37|Shortly after, a scene of a capture in the residential area was simulated. When [Zhang Hua] came out, [Xing Feng] approached, but was discovered and shot down. Immediately, [Zhang Hua] started shooting indiscriminately at the crowd, causing a large number of police officers and civilians to fall under the intense gunfire. With precise aim, [Cao Gang] hit [Zhang Hua] in the arm. Injured, [Zhang Hua] continued to shoot while retreating behind the car. Despite the pain, [Zhang Hua] stubbornly exposed the machine gun.
1:5:37|1:5:42|Firing indiscriminately towards the direction of the gunfire, a large number of innocent civilians who couldn't dodge in time were shot dead.
1:5:42|1:6:14|At this moment, [Cao Gang] calmly fired a shot through the car window, killing [Zhang Hua]. But at the last moment, [Zhang Hua] still threw the grenade towards the crowd. At this time, Captain Li Jiehui called, and [Zhang Hua] was entangled with his girlfriend Chen Chen, who was pinned underneath him. Chen Chen picked up the grenade on the table and was about to throw it away.
1:6:22|1:6:29|[Zhang Hua], with no interest at all, started grooming in the bathroom with a gun and a grenade, while the police officers downstairs remained vigilant without any relaxation.
1:6:29|1:6:48|Shortly after, Guo Ziman casually walked to the side of [Zhang Hua]'s car. After looking around, he squatted down next to the tire, took out a tool he had prepared in advance, and loosened the valve of the tire. Upstairs, after finishing washing up, [Zhang Hua] put on his clothes. Sitting on the bed, Chen Chen looked at his back and asked,
1:7:5|1:7:12|After finishing speaking, Mr. Wu placed the gun in Chen Chen's waist, put the hand grenade in his pocket, took the clothes pressed under Chen Chen, and said seriously,
1:7:24|1:7:33|[Zhang Hua] slapped Chen Chen in the face and said,
1:7:36|1:8:0|After the end of the quarrel between the couple, [Zhang Hua] walked up to the vehicle. The surveillance police officer saw [Zhang Hua] and notified through the radio. At that moment, Guo Zi looked up towards the building and happened to see Chen Chen watching [Zhang Hua] from the window. Just then, a tricycle accidentally collided with the car that [Xing Feng] was tracking.
1:8:12|1:8:21|After Li Jiehui at the base hung up the phone, he also became nervous. [Zhang Hua] saw through the rearview mirror that the car following him was still unaware, so he cautiously continued to drive around on the road.
1:8:28|1:8:38|[Zhang Hua] looked in the rearview mirror again after passing a corner and realizing the car wasn't following. He relaxed his guard and then called [Mr. Wu] in the car, preparing to get the money.
1:9:40|1:10:13|[Zhang Hua] was alerted to a flat tire, so he stopped by the roadside. After the captain hung up the phone in worry, [Zhang Hua], who was about to get off the car, cautiously picked up the handgun on the passenger seat. The passing woman angrily complained, and after [Zhang Hua] surveyed the surroundings, he found a repair shop not far ahead. Helpless, he had to drive the car to the entrance of the repair shop.
1:10:13|1:10:28|Even with a gun in his pocket, [Zhang Hua] was still uneasy and brought a grenade down from the car. Every move of his was under the surveillance of the police. Guo Zixiang, who was tailing from a distance, said to [Cao Gang] and others ambushing nearby,
1:11:16|1:11:31|After finalizing the battle plan, [Xing Feng] took off his communication headset. Wearing a tattered cotton jacket, [Xing Feng] walked halfway before suddenly turning around. Without any sense of incongruity, he smoothly sat down at a snack stall. Just as [Zhang Hua] noticed something suspicious, the noisy surroundings caught his attention.
1:11:36|1:11:58|[Zhang Hua] watched the commotion for a while without much thought, continuing to wait for the tire to be fixed. When [Xing Feng] saw the opportunity, he took off his coat, grabbed [Zhang Hua] from behind, and slammed him hard to the ground. The police quickly swarmed in, each performing their duties, pinning [Zhang Hua] down so he couldn't move. The detectives swiftly took away his gun, while [Cao Gang] struggled to snatch the hand grenade from [Zhang Hua].
1:12:2|1:12:7|Even experienced detectives like [Cao Gang] couldn't help but feel a chill down their spine and break out in a cold sweat after hearing his words.
1:12:7|1:12:43|18 hours after the incident, the leader of the kidnapping gang, [Zhang Hua], was captured by the police. As the vehicle stopped at the entrance of the police station, they escorted [Zhang Hua] towards the courtyard. Inside, the senior detective was already waiting, following the suspect into the interrogation room.
1:14:9|1:14:16|Prepared special police officers outside the building rushed in through the window using ropes.
1:14:32|1:14:38|Finally, [Zhang Hua] sat in the interrogation chair, with handcuffs on his hands behind his back, his ankles and waist securely locked.
1:14:56|1:15:20|[Zhang Hua] nodded, then turned to look at the clock hanging on the wall. Intentionally delaying, [Zhang Hua] looked at the two captains in front of him and began to speak. Starting from the night of the kidnapping, time passed by minute by minute. In the blink of an eye, the clock on the wall showed 8:05 in the evening. As the dumplings in [Zhang Hua]'s hand fell to the ground, the film returned to the beginning.
1:15:22|1:15:39|On the other side, the henchman in the rental room is cooking a pot of instant noodles in the kitchen, while the little Du inside the room is sleeping on the bed. [Mr. Wu], on the other hand, is wide awake, deep in thought. At this moment, the phone next to Cangzi rings.
1:15:48|1:16:7|Mr. Wu, full of confusion, asked Dawei, "Cao Gang and Xing Feng just walked into the interrogation room after devising a new interrogation plan in the police station courtyard. Xing Feng took the lunch box from the table and asked,"
1:17:8|1:17:16|In the control room, Li Jiehui immediately made a phone call to verify. As time drew closer, the anxious [Mr. Wu] asked Dawei,
1:19:7|1:19:14|In the cramped cabin, the restless Dawei approached [Mr. Wu] and said,
1:19:45|1:19:54|Just then, Cangzi and Xiaolei walked in, and Cangzi said to Dawei. Upon hearing this news, [Mr. Wu] still maintained his usual calm demeanor.
1:20:58|1:21:7|After receiving the ransom from Boss Kong, the ruthless [Zhang Hua] then said to his subordinates,
1:21:59|1:22:8|The convoy arrived at the hospital entrance in no time. Because [Zhang Hua] was an extremely dangerous bandit, capable of extreme actions at any moment, in order to ensure the safety of everyone around,
1:22:35|1:22:42|Two detectives brought [Zhang Hua] in front of Chen Chen, and after [Cao Gang] gestured for Weizi to let go of him, [Zhang Hua] said to Chen Chen,
1:23:10|1:23:18|The police officer discovered a foreign object in the crotch area of [Zhang Hua] using a metal detector.
1:23:29|1:23:37|After Cao Gang dragged the detective for inspection, he personally took off Zhang Hua's pants and searched through them. After a moment, Cao Gang locked eyes with Xing Feng and slowly raised the key he found.
1:23:48|1:24:5|[Xing Feng] was about to speak when the vibrating sound of a cellphone interrupted him. After getting off the car, the detective handcuffed [Zhang Hua]. Following orders from his superior, [Xing Feng] got back into the car and said to [Zhang Hua],
1:24:8|1:24:25|In the kitchen of the rental house, Xiao Lei is scooping out two portions of freshly cooked dumplings from the basin. The dumplings, just out of the pot, are steaming hot, exuding a particularly rich aroma. In this cold and bleak room, perhaps only these dumplings can bring a hint of warmth to the two. Xiao Lei places the dumplings in front of them.
1:24:31|1:24:47|The two, who hadn't eaten anything all day, had no appetite for the fragrant dumplings in front of them. The pitiful Xiao Dou, after staring at Mr. Wu for a while, picked up a dumpling and gobbled it down. Mr. Wu, after looking at Xiao Dou, also picked up a dumpling as if resigned. But after hesitating for a moment while looking at the dumpling, he asked,
1:25:8|1:25:30|Xiao Lei did not refute after hearing it, he pulled back the thick curtains halfway, and [Mr. Wu] looked quietly outside through the foggy glass, watching the fireworks constantly blooming. At this moment, even the fireworks could only be seen as a silhouette. The sorrow and helplessness surged in his heart, after suppressing the emotions in his heart, he had no more demands, lowered his head and quietly looked at the dumplings in front of him.
1:25:30|1:25:46|At the same time, Mr. Su at the police station also opened a plate of dumplings, but lost his appetite after eating one. When he returned to the courtyard, Dawei and Xiaolei had already dug a hole in the yard. Mr. Su put away his bowl and chopsticks and said to the two of them,
1:25:51|1:26:7|Xiao Dou glanced at the digital clock on the table showing 8:30, sat on the bed and couldn't help but burst into tears. [Mr. Wu] was equally sad, but he held back his tears and comforted Xiao Dou who was crying beside him.
1:26:23|1:26:31|Xiao Dou trembled and confessed to [Mr. Wu] in a shaky voice,
1:27:29|1:27:35|Da Wei, feeling a bit reluctant, finished speaking and then moved the table in front of the two aside. Cang Zi, leaning against the door frame, said to Da Wei,
1:27:46|1:28:9|At this moment, [Cao Gang] and others who had roughly determined the location were rushing towards the village where the cabin was located with a large number of police forces. Inside the cabin, Xiao Dou was leaning on [Mr. Wu] for a sense of security amidst the pervasive smell of death. [Mr. Wu] pressed Xiao Dou's head tightly against his face, stroking her cheek with his hand. Watching Xiao Dou trembling in his arms, the vacant-eyed [Mr. Wu] began to sing his own song.
1:28:31|1:28:40|Singing along, tears also fell from the corner of [Mr. Wu]'s eyes.
1:29:41|1:29:52|After singing the last sentence together, the two of them hugged tightly. Zhang Hua on the police car deliberately stalled for time and said,
1:30:32|1:30:50|The police convoy had turned into a pitch-black narrow road. Despite the poor lighting conditions, the convoy's speed did not slow down significantly with only the headlights. In no time, they arrived at the village where the cabin was located. Looking at the clock on the table showing 8:48, the man inside the cabin said to the two men airing outside,
1:31:5|1:31:11|Da Wei looked at the clock on the table showing 8:50 and decided to wait a little longer. In the police car, [Xing Feng] said to [Zhang Hua],
1:31:12|1:31:19|At this moment, the convoy cautiously turned off the headlights and quietly drove into the village.
1:31:22|1:31:48|Upon hearing the sudden barking of a dog, the ongoing argument between [Mr. Cang] and [Xiao Lei] was put aside as they cautiously walked into the yard to investigate. While [Xiao Lei] peered outside through the gap of the gate, [Mr. Cang] went to the other side of the wall to observe any suspicious activities in the resort. Despite [Mr. Cang]'s careful scrutiny of the outside for a long time, he still did not notice the detectives who had quietly approached the foot of the mountain. [Xing Feng] and [Cao Gang], along with [Zhang Hua] and a large number of armed police, met up with the chief who had arrived early.
1:33:26|1:33:35|[Cao Gang] laughed, then closed the car door and prepared to act. At this moment, with only 4 minutes left until 9 o'clock, [Xing Feng] in the woods grabbed [Cao Gang] and encouragingly said,
1:33:38|1:33:49|At this moment, [Cangzi] was still crouching on the wall in the courtyard, watching anxiously. His premonition was very bad, and he seemed a bit impatient. Meanwhile, Dawei, who was persuaded inside the house, was unlocking the door for [Mr. Wu].
1:34:8|1:34:29|[Mr. Wu] completely gave up struggling, lowered his head, and waited for the final three minutes. When the time reached 58 minutes, [Cangzi] added two more locks to the iron chain on [Xiaodou]'s hands. After finishing with [Xiaodou], [Cangzi] locked the only remaining lock on [Mr. Wu]'s hands. Then [Cangzi] closed the door, took out the wire from his pocket, and threw it in front of [Xiaolei].
1:34:46|1:35:0|[Xiao Lei] finally compromised and picked up the iron wire to strangle [Mr. Wu]'s neck. The cold wire tightened around their necks, making it increasingly difficult for them to breathe in just a few seconds.
1:35:2|1:35:14|Due to the lack of blood circulation, both of their faces were swollen and red. After a moment, even their eyes were filled with blood vessels. In front of the heavy iron chains and shackles, even if the two of them exerted 200% of their strength, it was of no use.
1:35:14|1:35:33|[Mr. Wu] stuck out his tongue, the veins on his face bulging. As time passed, [Mr. Wu]'s pupils gradually dilated, losing their luster. The struggling hands and feet of the two also gradually became still. At this moment, the whole world seemed to slow down, and it was then that the armed police flipped over the high wall and broke through the window.
1:35:36|1:35:57|[Xing Feng] and [Cao Gang] almost simultaneously broke through the wooden door fully armed, with [Cao Gang] swiftly pinning [Cangzi], who hadn't reacted yet, firmly against the wall. [Xing Feng] and other armed police quickly subdued [Xiao Lei] and Dawei. The armed police in the courtyard opened the tightly locked gate, and the main force rushed in. In an instant, a large number of armed police surrounded the courtyard, leaving no way out.
1:35:59|1:36:6|After confiscating the weapons of the three individuals, [Xing Feng] immediately came to [Mr. Wu] and [Xiao Dou] to comfort their emotions.
1:36:6|1:36:30|Just back from a visit to the gates of hell, [Mr. Wu] stood in disbelief as he looked at [Xing Feng] and a large number of armed police in front of him, unable to say a word. After ensuring the safety of the two, [Xing Feng] took out a key and unlocked the shackles on them. [Mr. Wu] sat on the ground, still at a loss, with a look of bewilderment in his eyes. An apple on the table rolled to the feet of the person pressed on the ground.
1:36:30|1:36:47|And at that moment, the alarm clock on the table, set for 9 o'clock, finally rang. It was with the ringing of this alarm clock that marked the successful completion of the 20-hour rescue operation. And for [Mr. Wu], it was finally waking up from what seemed like a 20-hour nightmare.
1:36:47|1:37:8|The three kidnappers were handcuffed and pressed onto the police car. While [Xing Feng] was unlocking the handcuffs for [Mr. Wu], the other armed police officers carefully searched every corner of the room. The officers in the courtyard also meticulously searched the car and the warehouse. The chief watched as [Xing Feng] and [Cao Gang] came out unscathed from the courtyard, and said with relief.
1:37:8|1:37:39|Mr. Wu, still in shock, walked out of the courtyard with Xiao Dou accompanied by several armed police officers. He stopped in front of the car, turned around to take a last look at the unforgettable courtyard before getting in. Xiao Dou, who had been bound for two days, was helped into the car by the police. After the chief inspector closed the door of their car, he signaled for them to leave. The rest of the vehicles followed suit, all with their sirens blaring, triumphantly returning. Inside the car, Mr. Wu and Xiao Dou...
1:37:39|1:37:47|There was no joy of surviving a disaster, instead they all sat in silence, pondering. [Cao Gang] asked softly,
1:38:8|1:38:38|After rescuing Mr. Wu and Xiao Dou, the convoy drove back to downtown Beijing in a grand manner. Mr. Su, Manager Cheng, and Xiao Dou's girlfriend were already waiting at the police station. When Mr. Wu got off the car, he tightly hugged Mr. Su. Mr. Wu, who had never cried in the face of vicious kidnappers and death, was now sobbing uncontrollably while hugging Mr. Su. Seeing his dear friend return alive, Mr. Su's heart, which had been hanging by a thread, finally relaxed, and tears streamed down his face.
1:38:38|1:38:45|After embracing Mr. Su for a long time, the recovered Mr. Wu then hugged Mr. Cheng, who was holding flowers, to the side.
1:39:0|1:39:14|After Xiao Dou's girlfriend finished speaking, she hugged Xiao Dou tightly. [Mr. Wu], seeing this, shed tears and embraced Mr. Su and Manager Cheng. And so, the two survivors and their families sat huddled together. The next day, [Xing Feng] sighed and said,
1:39:47|1:39:57|10 months later, the court handed down a verdict on the arrested [Zhang Hua] and others.
1:40:40|1:40:58|[Zhang Hua] nodded as he listened to his mother's words, tears streaming down his face. After hanging up the phone, [Zhang Hua] wiped away his tears, but when he saw his mother again, tears welled up in his eyes once more.
1:40:58|1:41:13|Shortly after, [Zhang Hua] stood in front of the glass wall. With tears streaming down his face, he tried hard to conceal his deep sorrow, looking at his mother who was already crying silently with a mixture of tears and smiles.
1:41:28|1:41:36|Mr. Wu walked up to Zhang Hua in a bright and glamorous manner. He looked at Zhang Hua, who was wearing handcuffs and ankle shackles during the prison visit, not knowing where to start for a moment.
1:42:10|1:42:21|After listening, [Mr. Wu] placed the prepared fruit basket in front of [Zhang Hua], and finally calmly lay in front of the iron window and said.
