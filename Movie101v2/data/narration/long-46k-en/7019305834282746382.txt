0:2:20|0:2:27|After filming, Wu Fuchun sat across from Jing Ruyi, looking at her.
0:3:10|0:3:21|[Jing Ruyi] disdainfully glanced at [Wu Fuchun], ignoring his outstretched hand. Seeing this, [Wu Fuchun] awkwardly withdrew his hand, leaning back in his chair, staring thoughtfully at [Jing Ruyi].
0:3:55|0:3:59|[Wu Fuchun] smugly looked at [Jing Ruyi], then followed her gaze to the window.
0:4:1|0:4:9|[Wu Fuchun] quickly took out a DSLR camera from his bag and started snapping away at the penguins outside the window.
0:4:35|0:4:42|At this moment, a thick fog rolled in, reducing visibility. The control tower called out to the pilots, warning them of a massive cyclone forming ahead.
0:5:4|0:5:13|The plane jolted heavily several times again, and [Wu Fuchun] immediately dropped the camera, hurriedly fastening the seat belt in a fluster. The plane slowly entered a dark cloud layer, with a dark and oppressive cloud inside, occasionally with lightning flashing across.
0:5:31|0:5:39|[Jing Ruyi] and Natasha ignored him, holding each other's hands tightly. Seeing this, [Wu Fuchun] became even more anxious, tightening the seatbelt as much as possible. At this moment, the control tower issued another warning.
0:5:42|0:6:1|The pilot flew the plane past lightning, with extremely low visibility in the foggy clouds. Relying on experience, the pilot continued to fly forward. [Wu Fuchun] looked out the window with a nearly tearful expression, and only after narrowly avoiding a mountain did the pilot have time to contact the control tower. At this moment
0:6:1|0:6:8|The plane has encountered severe icing and needs to make an emergency landing. The cockpit instruments are flashing uncontrollably, causing [Wu Fuchun] to panic.
0:6:10|0:6:21|The pilot tried his best to control the plane, but couldn't stop the turbulence. The overhead bins shook more and more violently, and suddenly the plane seemed to be suspended in mid-air as if someone had pressed the pause button.
0:6:21|0:6:39|Natasha then fell uncontrollably, like a dry leaf being blown by the wind. At this moment, Wu Fuchun and [Jing Ruyi] screamed in confusion, while [Jing Ruyi] held onto the handrail, closed her eyes tightly, her face pale. The plane continued to flip uncontrollably, making everyone extremely uncomfortable.
0:6:39|0:6:58|The suitcases on the luggage rack also fell down one after another, with the items inside scattered all over the cabin. What's even more dangerous is a thermos cup flew up and hit the pilot on the head. The pilot fell straight onto the control stick, and the plane headed straight towards the mountain ahead, scraping the belly of the aircraft as it rushed up the mountainside.
0:6:58|0:7:10|The left engine hit a rock, instantly igniting a fire, and the propeller, due to inertia, swung back again, directly stirring into the cabin. The rapidly rotating propeller blade brushed against the hem of [Jing Ruyi]'s clothes.
0:7:10|0:7:28|In an instant, her glasses were shattered, causing a loss of cabin pressure and sending a large number of items flying out of the cabin, including the crucial latitude and longitude detector. The plane is now completely out of control, intentionally skimming the mountainside and sliding down, flipping and crashing, with the pilot and seat scraping out.
0:7:28|0:7:37|After skimming over the mountain, the plane did not stop, but continued to dive forward along its inertia, crashing onto the ice surface.
0:7:39|0:7:48|At this moment, the three people in the cabin are unconscious, their fate unknown. The film begins with this plane crash.
0:7:52|0:8:9|After an unknown period of time, [Wu Fuchun] finally opened his eyes. His mind was still spinning, and for a moment he couldn't figure out where he was. He could see half of his head buried in the snow. After a moment of daze, he finally turned his eyes and struggled to get up.
0:8:9|0:8:27|Originally, [Wu Fuchun] was knocked down with a chair in a snowy field. He quickly unfastened the safety buckle around his waist, then fell off the chair. [Wu Fuchun] blinked hard, trying to clear his head a bit, then stood up. At this moment, there was nothing around except for vast glaciers and the chair.
0:8:27|0:8:38|He took a few steps, holding his neck, before weakly collapsing on the ground. With a dazed look in his eyes, he inadvertently turned his head to the side, only to be stunned by the sight before him.
0:8:38|0:8:53|Only to see the wreckage of the plane everywhere, scattered all over the ground, the tail of the plane was lifted up under the huge impact, only the cabin barely remained intact. [Wu Fuchun] looked fearfully at everything in front of him, a little hesitant to face it.
0:8:53|0:9:12|Suddenly he panicked, touching his face, then looking at his hands and feeling his head intact. Immediately after, [Wu Fuchun] pinched his thighs, calves, and knees. Confirming that he was not injured, the sudden strange noise made [Wu Fuchun] look back at the wreckage of the plane.
0:9:13|0:9:35|He instantly welled up with tears, pacing aimlessly in place. At this moment, [Jing Ruyi] was still lying in the cabin of the plane, her head hitting a cabinet. Blood kept flowing down her forehead, and after a while, she slowly opened her eyes. Suddenly, she felt liquid dripping from above her head, and she sluggishly lifted her head.
0:9:35|0:9:46|Natascha, sitting next to her, was hanging upside down with blood continuously flowing from her mouth. [Jing Ruyi] was too preoccupied to care about Natascha at the moment, wiping the blood off her face.
0:9:46|0:10:4|Struggling to sit up with her upper body, she found her legs trapped under a huge steel plate. [Jing Ruyi] was both angry and frustrated as she pushed with all her might against the steel plate on her leg, but it didn't budge an inch despite her efforts.
0:10:5|0:10:21|At this moment, Natasha finally regained consciousness, furrowing her brow and opening her eyes. [Jing Ruyi] frantically tapped on the airplane window to seek help, and [Wu Fuchun] rushed into the cabin upon hearing the noise, only to be shocked by the scene before him.
0:10:22|0:10:28|[Wu Fuchun] carefully looked at the position of the iron plate on the ground, then glanced at the weakly breathing Natasha.
0:10:30|0:10:40|[Wu Fuchun] nodded tremblingly, lifted Natasha first, and tried to put her down from the overturned seat. What he didn't see was a piece of iron had already pierced Natasha.
0:10:40|0:10:57|[Wu Fuchun] unbuckled Natasha's seatbelt and carried her out of the cabin, while [Jing Ruyi] was still pinned under the metal sheet, unable to move, watching helplessly as [Wu Fuchun] and Natasha left the cabin. Mixed emotions flooded her mind, every second at this moment was a torment for her.
0:10:58|0:11:5|After settling Natasha down, [Wu Fuchun] quickly returned to the cabin, giving [Jing Ruyi] a renewed sense of hope for survival.
0:11:14|0:11:30|The sudden turbulence of the plane caused [Wu Fuchun] to fall down. By now, the ice had already cracked open, and the cabin was rapidly sinking, allowing seawater to rush in. Seeing this, [Wu Fuchun] quickly picked up the backpack and prepared to rush outwards.
0:11:30|0:11:43|He glanced apologetically at [Jing Ruyi], then rushed out without looking back. Facing the desertion of his teammates, [Jing Ruyi] felt both pain and despair as the seawater continued to spread upwards.
0:11:43|0:11:55|[Jing Ruyi] could only sit up straight, trying her best to lift the steel plate on her leg. As self-rescue proved futile, [Jing Ruyi] finally burst into tears. Suddenly, [Wu Fuchun] appeared at the cabin door.
0:11:55|0:12:4|He clung to the door frame of the cabin, watching as [Jing Ruyi] cried and struggled to lift the steel plate. When [Jing Ruyi] saw [Wu Fuchun], a hint of pleading smile appeared on her face.
0:12:4|0:12:14|Unbeknownst to [Wu Fuchun], her gaze was actually fixed on the black suitcase behind her. She grabbed a fire extinguisher to wedge under the steel plate, and forcefully pulled up the upper body of [Jing Ruyi].
0:12:18|0:12:35|[Wu Fuchun] quickly dropped [Jing Ruyi], and leaned over the steel plate trying to pull out her foot, but the non-slip boot was firmly stuck under the plate. With the strength of both, they couldn't get it out at all. [Wu Fuchun] could only pull [Jing Ruyi]'s foot out of the shoe, grab her arm, and drag her out with all his might.
0:12:35|0:12:52|The two escaped from the cabin, but the 10-meter ice couldn't hold up. The wreckage of the plane slowly sank in front of them. In a panic, [Wu Fuchun] fell to the ground but didn't dare to stop for a moment. He grabbed [Jing Ruyi]'s clothes and crawled further away, with [Wu Fuchun] using both hands and feet to move backwards.
0:12:52|0:13:4|Until he felt safe enough to stop, the plane quickly disappeared into the ice hole. Now, there were only the three of them on the ice, with [Wu Fuchun] and [Jing Ruyi] looking at everything in front of them.
0:13:4|0:13:16|Wu Fuchun, who was the first to regain his strength, couldn't calm down for a long time. He propped up his feet and held up his phone to search for a signal everywhere, while Jing Ruyi sat beside Natasha, reaching out to touch her carotid artery.
0:13:16|0:13:34|After a while, [Jing Ruyi] slowly stopped and [Wu Fuchun] looked at the phone with "No Service" in the top left corner, his brows furrowed. [Jing Ruyi] covered Natasha's eyes with her hand, tears streaming down uncontrollably. [Wu Fuchun] silently crouched in front of [Jing Ruyi], not saying a word for a long time.
0:13:34|0:13:41|After giving [Jing Ruyi] some time to calm down, a while later, [Wu Fuchun] finally couldn't hold back and took a few steps forward.
0:13:43|0:13:49|[Jing Ruyi] sat on the side absentmindedly, as if not hearing a word of what [Wu Fuchun] was saying.
0:13:59|0:14:12|[Wu Fuchun] furrowed his brow in thought, then lifted his head to look at [Jing Ruyi]. [Jing Ruyi] raised her wrist to check the time, only to find that her watch face had been shattered.
0:14:25|0:14:44|The confident words of the high-altitude physicist hit [Wu Fuchun] like a hammer. He sat weakly on the ice, looking around at the vast white glaciers in silence. Soon, [Wu Fuchun] regained his composure and began to rearrange the remaining supplies.
0:14:50|0:15:8|[Jing Ruyi] ignored [Wu Fuchun], she picked up a handful of snow and applied it to her wound. [Wu Fuchun] glanced disdainfully at [Jing Ruyi], then continued to gather resources around him, emptying the suitcase for [Jing Ruyi] to sit in. [Jing Ruyi] sat motionless, staring at Natasha's body.
0:15:14|0:15:29|[Jing Ruyi] lowered her head to look at the body next to her, then turned to [Wu Fuchun] with a pleading expression. As the only male with a healthy and pain-free body, the wealthy [Wu Fuchun] willingly transformed into a laborer, tying one end of the rope to the suitcase.
0:15:29|0:15:50|On the other end, dragging it laboriously on his shoulder, one side of the suitcase contained Natasha's body, while the other side held the injured [Jing Ruyi]. [Jing Ruyi], clutching the remaining supplies, [Wu Fuchun] stopped in his tracks and looked around in confusion.
0:15:58|0:16:16|[Wu Fuchun] looked around in confusion, then obediently picked up the rope and walked forward with great effort. Soon they arrived at a wide ridge they needed to cross. It would take a long time, as the weather had become extremely harsh in this area.
0:16:34|0:16:41|Ruyi hurriedly took out a pickaxe from her backpack and threw it to [Wu Fuchun], who then dug up the ground desperately after receiving it.
0:16:45|0:17:3|[Wu Fuchun] had a fierce expression, never daring to stop for a moment. Meanwhile, not far away, a blizzard mixed with a storm was roaring towards them, as if it were the end of the world. Ruyi struggled to climb out of the trunk and crawled towards [Wu Fuchun]. The wind and snow grew stronger and stronger, and soon a layer of frost formed on Natasha's face.
0:17:3|0:17:21|[Wu Fuchun] frantically dug through the snow, quickly digging out a half-meter deep pit, while Ruyi lay on the other side of the snow pit. Continuously pushing the snow out, the storm was getting closer and closer, pressing down overwhelmingly. At the last moment, they finally dug a snow pit big enough for two people and crawled into it.
0:17:21|0:17:38|And Natasha's body and backpack were left outside the pit, the fierce blizzard constantly sweeping over her. At this moment, the sky over Antarctica was gloomy, with gray murky clouds covering the sky, and the storm raging over the glaciers like sharp swords.
0:17:38|0:17:46|Finally, the snow stopped, and through the crack in the luggage compartment, the sky gradually brightened up, and the howling wind disappeared.
0:17:46|0:17:57|The two in the pit were close together, with [Jing Ruyi] slowly opening her eyes. [Wu Fuchun], on the other hand, was sleeping soundly leaning against [Jing Ruyi], seeming to sense the movement beside him, with a frown on his face.
0:17:57|0:18:5|Opening his eyes, he blinked and looked at [Jing Ruyi] next to him with confusion, clearly not fully awake.
0:18:6|0:18:14|[Wu Fuchun] raised his arm and pushed the corner of the overhead luggage compartment with force, the sudden light surrounded [Jing Ruyi] who couldn't open her eyes.
0:18:22|0:18:30|[Jing Ruyi] looked at Wu Fuchun as if he were an idiot, then lowered her head to examine her own calf.
0:18:47|0:18:51|[Jing Ruyi]'s eyes were filled with suppressed resentment.
0:19:4|0:19:13|Wu Fuchun then vented his frustration by pushing the suitcase aside, and struggled to climb out of the snow pit. He picked up his handbag and walked forward without looking back.
0:19:17|0:19:35|Without the burden of Natasha and [Jing Ruyi], [Wu Fuchun] quickly walked to the top of the ridge. Looking from a distance, the yellow fur moved slowly, like a proud rooster. He first walked slowly on a snowy slope, and suddenly, with some unknown strength, he even started to run.
0:19:35|0:19:46|[Wu Fuchun], after running and climbing to the top of the mountain, continued to walk forward along this line. Upon reaching the final vantage point, [Wu Fuchun] first threw the handbag up.
0:19:46|0:20:0|Then [Wu Fuchun] used both hands and feet to climb up the rocks. Obviously, this wealthy young man was not a fan of sports, but he managed to climb up here relying solely on his will to survive and unwillingness to give up, standing at the highest point of the mountain ridge. He then staggered forward for several steps.
0:20:0|0:20:11|[Wu Fuchun] gritted his teeth, quickly pulled out his phone from his pocket, and raised it high again, trying to find a signal, which was his last glimmer of hope in his eyes.
0:20:11|0:20:22|On the other side, the sound of birds caught [Jing Ruyi], who was still in the snow pit, off guard. She seemed to have realized something, her expression changing from initial surprise to an undisguised fear.
0:20:22|0:20:34|[Jing Ruyi] cautiously peeks out half of her head, only to see a group of Antarctic skuas feasting voraciously on Natasha's body. [Jing Ruyi] looks ahead in disbelief, unsure of how to shift her gaze away.
0:20:34|0:20:46|At this moment, [Wu Fuchun] is still standing at the highest point of the mountain ridge, holding up his phone to search for signal. [Wu Fuchun] looks at the screen in frustration, and his hand eventually drops helplessly.
0:20:52|0:21:4|[Wu Fuchun] was so angry that he picked up a stone and threw it into the distance. However, he exerted too much force, slipped under his feet, and rolled down the hillside. He quickly grabbed onto the snow to stop himself.
0:21:4|0:21:14|Exhausted, he finally managed to stop and lay motionless on the ground, using all his strength to barely prop up his upper body with his arms.
0:21:14|0:21:37|The first thing that [Wu Fuchun] did was to search for the fallen phone. He hurried to the phone, about to pick it up, but coincidentally saw something exciting. Below the snow slope stood a small wooden house covered with snow. On the other side, more and more thief seagulls came to search for food. [Jing Ruyi] tightly hugged a thermos cup, curled up in a snow pit, and closed her eyes tightly.
0:21:37|0:21:55|Trembling in fear, the agile seagull flew over upon hearing the sound, and mercilessly pecked at [Jing Ruyi]. Ruyi waved her thermos cup in terror, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't drive it away. Suddenly, a hand accurately grabbed the seagull by the neck and threw it far away. After driving away the seagull, [Wu Fuchun] appeared.
0:22:0|0:22:17|[Wu Fuchun] emptied everything from his backpack onto the ground, first selecting sunglasses to put in his pocket, then casually picking up a piece of underwear. After seeing what it was, he hurriedly threw it to the ground, then stuffed a thermos into the other side of his backpack, and also put a stack of dollars into his fur pocket.
0:22:17|0:22:31|After doing all this, he threw the pickaxe at his feet and walked forward. [Wu Fuchun] walked up to Natasha, knelt down slowly, frowned, and finally reached out his hand. He took off Natasha's knitted hat.
0:22:31|0:22:44|Ruyi didn't say anything when she saw this scene, she just lowered her head sadly. [Wu Fuchun] put the hat on his own head and started shoveling snow onto Natasha. Soon, a grave made of snow was built.
0:22:47|0:23:6|Ruyi still sat in place, lowering her head in confusion. Soon, the two of them set off again, with [Wu Fuchun] carrying the injured Ruyi towards the small wooden house, their last hope. They walked on the plain at times, and climbed up the hill at other times. The snow in Antarctica was deep enough to reach their calves, making each step [Wu Fuchun] took very difficult.
0:23:15|0:23:23|Ruyi's leg injury kept rubbing against the rock, while [Wu Fuchun] carried her on his back, climbing up the rocks with great effort.
0:23:24|0:23:33|[Wu Fuchun] took a deep breath, then dragged [Jing Ruyi] up. Exhausted, [Wu Fuchun] collapsed at the top of the slope, with [Jing Ruyi] falling to the side.
0:23:45|0:24:2|Facing the paralyzed [Jing Ruyi], [Wu Fuchun] without hesitation lifted her onto his shoulders. He staggered forward for two steps, then his knees gave out, and they both tumbled down the long snowy slope with no cover around, rolling for quite a while before coming to a stop.
0:24:2|0:24:10|[Wu Fuchun], stabilizing himself, immediately crawled towards [Jing Ruyi] in front, while [Jing Ruyi], under the dual torment of physical pain and mental anguish, eventually passed out.
0:24:12|0:24:22|After an unknown period of time, [Jing Ruyi] finally opened her eyes, only to see the dim wooden furniture in front of her. She saw [Wu Fuchun] leaning on the wooden table beside her.
0:24:25|0:24:37|Upon hearing the knocking, [Wu Fuchun] opened his eyes to find that [Jing Ruyi] had already woken up. [Wu Fuchun] hurried to the bedside of [Jing Ruyi], who was struggling to prop up half of her body with tears in her eyes.
0:25:2|0:25:14|[Jing Ruyi] looked at [Wu Fuchun] with tears in her eyes, calmly. [Wu Fuchun] stood with his hands crossed in front of his chest, not saying a word. In the end, he accepted the heavy responsibility and steadied [Jing Ruyi]'s foot with one hand.
0:25:14|0:25:21|Wu Fuchun carefully pulled down the zipper on her shorts, but every move brought pain to Jing Ruyi.
0:25:22|0:25:37|Suddenly, [Jing Ruyi] grabbed [Wu Fuchun]'s arm. [Wu Fuchun] remained silent for a moment, nodded, and then turned to walk outside to wait.
0:25:38|0:25:56|[Wu Fuchun] stopped in his tracks, turned around in surprise, only to see [Jing Ruyi] with tears streaming down her face. At this moment, [Jing Ruyi] had trampled on her own pride, unable to lift her saddened head. [Wu Fuchun] pursed his lips, showing sympathy tinged with a hint of heartache. He turned back and sat down next to [Jing Ruyi].
0:25:56|0:26:7|As Wu Fuchun reached out his hand, Jing Ruyi quickly grabbed the blanket beside him and covered his lower body. He felt embarrassed, sniffled, and tremblingly reached his hand into the blanket.
0:26:7|0:26:14|Unbuckling his belt, [Wu Fuchun] pursed his lips and looked expressionlessly to the side, preserving [Jing Ruyi]'s last trace of dignity.
0:26:15|0:26:24|Shortly after, [Jing Ruyi] tearfully untied the belt around her waist, pulled down her pants from her hips, but once the pants reached her thighs, she couldn't exert any more force.
0:26:24|0:26:42|[Wu Fuchun] awkwardly reached into the blanket, pulled down slowly at the waist of the pants, and as [Wu Fuchun] moved, [Jing Ruyi] tightly gripped the blanket with both hands. Tears of pain streamed down, and on the middle of the left calf, a large bruise swelled dark purple, a shocking sight.
0:26:43|0:27:0|[Jing Ruyi] gritted her teeth and nodded, while [Wu Fuchun] pressed on her knee with one hand and gripped her leg with the other, slowly twisting to the left. Glancing at [Jing Ruyi], [Wu Fuchun] did not dare to pause, the immense pain causing [Jing Ruyi] to collapse and faint.
0:27:4|0:27:25|Fuchun was at a loss for a moment, standing by the bed not knowing what to do. Outside, the cold wind was still blowing fiercely, and snowflakes were constantly blowing into the wooden house through the cracks in the ice wall. Exhausted, Fuchun lay on the upper bunk, pursing his lips unwilling to wake up. Frowning and squinting, he turned over in confusion and looked towards Jing Ruyi on the lower bunk.
0:27:25|0:27:40|[Jing Ruyi] was seen, with a helpless look on her face, frowning in silence under a blanket. Fuchun waited by the bed for a while without any response, impatiently lay back down. [Jing Ruyi] knocked on the floorboards again.
0:27:49|0:28:10|After saying these words, she dared not look at Fuchun again. Then Fuchun sawed a big hole in the bed board, while [Jing Ruyi] curled up in the corner of the lower bunk. Her head weakly leaned against the edge of the bed, already feeling lifeless. Soon Fuchun chiseled a big hole in the bed board, then placed a copper basin under the hole before getting up and walking away.
0:28:11|0:28:28|After everything was done, Wu Fuchun walked to the door without looking back. Jing Ruyi remained motionless, only the shadow of her profile silently expressing the torment in her heart. Outside the door, the snowstorm continued, Wu Fuchun opened the wooden door and walked out wearing only a down jacket.
0:28:28|0:28:47|Shortly after, [Wu Fuchun] staggered down the steps in the wind and snow, shivering with his arms crossed. He looked around for his target, and suddenly his eyes were drawn to a yellow oil tank. He bent over and pondered for a while, then squatted in front of the oil tank, carefully wiping the scale in front of him.
0:28:47|0:28:54|Upon realizing what it was, [Wu Fuchun] immediately rushed towards the cabinet in the corner where a generator was placed.
0:28:54|0:29:5|[Wu Fuchun] opened the cabinet door and pressed the red button on the left, then he searched around the generator for something. Upon seeing the pull cord on the right, [Wu Fuchun] grabbed it without hesitation and started pulling with all his strength.
0:29:8|0:29:20|At this moment, [Jing Ruyi] sat on the bed, dealing with her need to relieve herself with shame and despair. Suddenly, the chandelier above the table emitted a dim yellow light, and the electric heater in the center of the room also lit up.
0:29:20|0:29:32|[Jing Ruyi] couldn't help but look up, staring fixedly at the glowing electric heater in front of her. Outside, it was still a world of ice and snow, a place of despair, while this room was like a faint flicker of flame.
0:29:47|0:29:59|[Wu Fuchun] flipped through the items on the shelf and reported them to [Jing Ruyi], while [Jing Ruyi] carefully recorded the information of these items in her notebook.
0:30:23|0:30:30|[Jing Ruyi] frowned, looked at the can thrown on the bed, and picked it up to examine it carefully.
0:31:44|0:31:53|[Wu Fuchun] couldn't calm the anger in his heart. He stood up and walked to the window, with one hand on his waist, looking outside with an unprecedented determination in his eyes.
0:31:55|0:32:16|[Jing Ruyi] took out a marker pen and started writing down all the known information on a poster hanging on the wall. She first listed the numbers 1 to 75 and drew simple coordinate axes. [Jing Ruyi] stared at the information on the poster and crossed out the numbers 1 to 3 with a red pen.
0:32:31|0:32:46|The diesel generator was working steadily. This was a crucial equipment for the two to survive. Gradually, there was a hint of warmth in the room. The electric heater was also moved closer to the bed, and [Wu Fuchun] was sleeping unattractively on the upper bunk.
0:32:48|0:32:59|While [Jing Ruyi] on the lower bunk kept her eyes wide open, [Wu Fuchun] soon put on [Jing Ruyi]'s ski suit and started preparing for departure. He poured the clear porridge into an aluminum lunch box and a thermos cup respectively.
0:32:59|0:33:11|[Jing Ruyi] was still sitting on the lower bunk, earnestly drawing on a poster. [Wu Fuchun] picked up the pot of porridge, tilted his head back and drank every drop of the clear porridge. Then he carefully looked at the lunch box and thermos.
0:33:11|0:33:24|He glanced at [Jing Ruyi] again, and when he confirmed that [Jing Ruyi] was not looking in this direction, he quietly poured some clear porridge from the lunch box into the thermos. [Jing Ruyi] did not notice [Wu Fuchun]'s little move.
0:33:24|0:33:29|Wu Fuchun handed the lunch box to Jing Ruyi while still looking at the poster attentively.
0:33:30|0:33:38|[Wu Fuchun] immediately started to search through each pocket, and sure enough, he pulled out a few candies from the left pocket and handed them to [Jing Ruyi].
0:33:46|0:33:50|[Wu Fuchun] put the candy back into his pocket, then took down his fur coat from the upper bunk.
0:33:56|0:34:3|[Wu Fuchun] stuffed the thermos with porridge into the side pocket of the backpack, and then put on a knitted hat on his head.
0:35:36|0:35:58|[Jing Ruyi] pointed in the opposite direction of [Wu Fuchun]'s line of sight. [Jing Ruyi] sat on the lower bunk without saying a word, but still lifted her head to see him off. [Wu Fuchun] pushed open the door and walked out, but became confused by the scene in front of him, so he helplessly walked in a circle.
0:36:0|0:36:12|[Wu Fuchun] stood at the door muttering to himself, shouted towards the wooden house, then turned around helplessly. He looked around and finally tentatively chose a direction, gritted his teeth and walked forward.
0:36:46|0:36:57|On the vast snowy plain for nearly 10 hours, the tiny figure of [Wu Fuchun] moved slowly like a small black dot. Inside the cabin, [Jing Ruyi] remained seated on the lower bunk, carefully circling the number 4 in red.
0:37:30|0:37:41|Every day's journey consumes a huge amount of energy for [Wu Fuchun]. Usually, after returning, he falls into a deep sleep, and in the blink of an eye, the numbers 5 and 6 on the poster are also crossed out.
0:37:41|0:37:58|Day after day, [Wu Fuchun] remained away for a long time, while the two of them searched for their last hope. Occasionally, he would come across some interesting little things. A seal could be seen looking puzzled, tilting its head.
0:37:59|0:38:12|The little seal glanced at [Wu Fuchun], then lazily lay down on the ground. [Wu Fuchun] helplessly waved his hand and continued to walk forward, soon arriving at a glacier.
0:38:12|0:38:32|In this scene, not only is there a vast expanse of sea, but also adorable penguins standing in groups of three or four. [Wu Fuchun] is crawling on the ground, taking out his phone to take a close-up photo with himself and the penguins. Then he joins their group, spreading his arms and kneeling on the ground, imitating the penguins as he waddles forward.
0:38:32|0:38:46|At this moment he seemed to forget the predicament he was in, standing at the top of a slope and throwing his backpack directly down. At the same time, he opened his arms and lay on the ground, sliding down the snowy slope, enjoying himself immensely.
0:38:46|0:38:57|Perhaps this was the happiest day for him since he set foot on Antarctica. After sliding to the bottom of the slope, [Wu Fuchun] lay in the snow, reluctant to leave, enjoying this rare moment of tranquility.
0:39:3|0:39:9|Bearded [Wu Fuchun] squats on the ground wearing sunglasses, staring at the seagulls in front of him.
0:39:19|0:39:37|Suddenly, a loud noise from afar startled the seabirds and they flew away. Wu Fuchun raised his head alertly and saw a large glacier suddenly cracking. It was heading straight towards the ice where he was standing. Wu Fuchun quickly stood up, grabbed his backpack, and ran forward. The rolling ice blocks soon caught up behind Wu Fuchun.
0:39:37|0:39:45|Poor [Wu Fuchun] was running for his life while trying to pull up his pants in a hurry. He couldn't help but glance back, so scared that he couldn't even hold onto his cigar in his mouth.
0:39:45|0:40:2|The avalanche behind him was roaring, he grabbed his belt with one hand and his backpack with the other. Just as he ran to a huge rock, he was swept down by the avalanche along with his backpack. He could only cower behind the rock, trembling, praying to safely survive this disaster.
0:40:23|0:40:40|Ten days passed quickly. [Wu Fuchun] walked towards the window while chewing on canned food. The scene outside the window made his face turn serious - the sky was filled with fierce winds and heavy snow, with extremely low visibility.
0:40:52|0:40:58|[Wu Fuchun] reluctantly sealed the can and frowned at [Jing Ruyi].
0:41:0|0:41:12|[Wu Fuchun] sat in front of the wooden table, staring at the drawings and writings on the poster of [Jing Ruyi]. [Jing Ruyi] turned around and looked quietly at [Wu Fuchun], with a hint of grievance and sadness in her eyes. [Wu Fuchun] dared not face such a gaze.
0:41:20|0:41:33|[Wu Fuchun] took three or four steps and knelt by the lower bunk, taking the pen from [Jing Ruyi]'s hand and reaching over her body. He drew an arrow pointing towards the east of the seal, while [Jing Ruyi] watched his movements intently.
0:41:50|0:41:59|[Jing Ruyi] lifted the blanket and stared at her crooked left leg in silence for a long time, while the number on the poster had already reached fifteen.
0:41:59|0:42:16|On that day, [Wu Fuchun] went to search for the supply station as usual. He climbed up the last hill in the direction he had locked onto before, only to see the vast sea and endless glaciers in front of him. Looking down, he saw a desolate and uninhabited area with not a single soul in sight.
0:42:16|0:42:25|He took out a thermos cup from his backpack, carefully poured some porridge onto the lid, tilted his head back and poured it into his mouth. This was his two days' ration.
0:42:25|0:42:37|After filling his stomach with a simple meal, [Wu Fuchun] took out a notebook and a pen. His fingers were already frozen in the cold weather as he carefully drew the detailed location where he was currently at in the notebook.
0:42:37|0:42:46|After finishing the recording, [Wu Fuchun] wiped his nose, subconsciously looked around, and below the mountain hollow, he saw a human skeleton.
0:43:12|0:43:19|[Jing Ruyi] took a sip with a skeptical look.
0:43:32|0:43:45|The smell of the thief's soup was too strong, forcing [Wu Fuchun] to vomit all the bones and soup. It has been 17 days so far.
0:43:59|0:44:8|He walked up to [Jing Ruyi] and gently grabbed her calf, placing it softly on the bed.
0:44:26|0:44:34|[Wu Fuchun] sneered at [Jing Ruyi], covered her with a blanket, and another day passed. [Jing Ruyi] drew a red circle on 18.
0:46:7|0:46:37|[Wu Fuchun] set off again, this time throwing his backpack to the side, sticking his butt up and lying on the ice. He then took out a fishing rod, attached a piece of bait, carefully extended the rod, and cast it into the ice hole. As time passed, [Wu Fuchun] changed his posture from sitting to lying down, resting his head on the backpack, looking helplessly at the sky, tightly holding the fishing rod in his hand. Suddenly, the fishing rod moved, and the pulling sensation became more and more obvious.
0:46:37|0:46:49|[Wu Fuchun] knelt on the ground, desperately pulling out a fish of about two or three decimeters from the ice hole in Weixian County. [Wu Fuchun] ecstatically pounced on it, holding the fish and constantly examining it.
0:46:51|0:47:9|[Wu Fuchun] caught a slippery sea fish, the smile on his face couldn't be hidden, and soon he returned with a full load. Suddenly, a loud noise sounded around him, and quickly his smile froze on his face. Suddenly, a two-meter-wide crack opened up beneath his feet, and he fell down without any warning.
0:47:9|0:47:29|[Wu Fuchun] kept sinking, he clumsily crashed into the rocks and finally fell heavily onto a platform. [Wu Fuchun] lay on his side on the snow, completely unconscious, as the snow slowly slid down his temple. On the other side of the platform was a bottomless abyss, just like what he was facing now, with no end in sight.
0:47:29|0:47:46|After an unknown period of time, [Wu Fuchun] finally regained some consciousness. His eyelids trembled slightly, then suddenly shook violently as if in a nightmare. [Wu Fuchun] finally woke up. He struggled to stand up, and the snow on his body shook off with his movements.
0:47:46|0:48:7|It is obvious that he has been unconscious for a long time. He was sitting on the ground, scared by the deep cliff in front of him. After a while, he realized that the platform he was on was at least a dozen meters away from the ground where he fell. But [Wu Fuchun] did not give up completely. He gritted his teeth, stood up, and looked around for a way out.
0:48:7|0:48:17|The platform was not large, and [Wu Fuchun] easily found the only passage. However, his previous injury had not healed, so he could only limp in while hugging his body.
0:48:17|0:48:47|In the crevice, every step is unknown. The passage he is in can only accommodate one person, and beyond the passage is a wide platform. Without stopping, [Wu Fuchun] continues to move forward to the next passage. [Wu Fuchun] crawls through using both hands and feet. He is shocked by the scene before him. The area he is in is hollow, with an extension of a platform of only 10 square meters at the mouth of the cave, resembling the cold and eerie Pan Si Cave from Journey to the West.
0:48:47|0:49:5|This is an unknown space that he has never encountered before, presenting in front of him is a natural glacier cave. [Wu Fuchun] trembled as he took two steps forward, stood at the edge, mustered up the courage to look down at the abyss beneath his feet, so dark that the camera couldn't capture it.
0:49:5|0:49:28|The blizzard continued outside, making the wooden cabin appear tiny on the vast Antarctic wilderness. [Jing Ruyi], wrapped in fur, shivered as she lay on the bed watching the electric heater in the study. She never turned it on when she was alone. Meanwhile, [Wu Fuchun] ventured deeper into the darkness, squeezing through a bizarre hollow.
0:49:28|0:49:37|Wu Fuchun found himself at a dead end. He sighed, looked around, then retraced his steps to search for the next exit.
0:49:37|0:49:48|Twenty-eight days have passed in the blink of an eye, and the temperature inside the wooden house has remained at -5 degrees Celsius. At this moment, [Wu Fuchun] still hasn't found a way out, and no sunlight can penetrate the dim ice cracks.
0:49:48|0:50:3|Mental and physical exhaustion forced him to lie on the ground, but he knew the consequences would be unbearable if he continued like this. Thinking of this, [Wu Fuchun] mustered up his strength and tried to sit up. He propped his legs against the ice wall.
0:50:6|0:50:12|[Wu Fuchun] crossed his legs and stared fiercely ahead for a long time, then pointed to the fishing rod beside him.
0:50:25|0:50:34|[Wu Fuchun] stared at the fishing rod in silence for a long time, then looked up at the faint light shining through the ice.
0:50:38|0:50:50|In this isolated corner, the response [Wu Fuchun] desires is not forthcoming. [Wu Fuchun] purses his lips, watching the sunlight filtering through the ice, then lowers his head in contemplation. Suddenly, a sound behind him catches his attention.
0:50:50|0:51:4|[Wu Fuchun] turned his head alertly and saw a huge hole above. He quickly stood up and, upon seeing the full extent of the hole, couldn't help but open his mouth in shock. On the other side, [Jing Ruyi] was lying on the bed covered in fur, clearly sleeping restlessly.
0:52:54|0:53:13|Outside, the blizzard was raging, causing the wooden door to creak and the chandeliers inside the house to sway constantly. The small rods of the generator outside finally couldn't bear the weight and flew out, breaking the wires leading into the wooden house. The generator stopped working in an instant, as time passed by slowly.
0:53:13|0:53:45|At this moment, a silence fell, the sound of heartbeats clear and strong. [Wu Fuchun] was pinned under thick snow, unable to speak. After a long time, he finally managed to create a small space around him, allowing him to move his body slightly. In this pitch-black depth where he couldn't see his own hand in front of his face, he instinctively took out a lighter. The faint light from the lighter gave [Wu Fuchun] a glimmer of hope. With one hand holding the lighter and the other constantly climbing forward, his backpack on his back was difficult to drag through the snow.
0:53:46|0:53:58|The lighter suddenly went out, [Wu Fuchun] anxiously rubbed the lighter. The more anxious he was, the harder it was to light the lighter. After a while, the lighter finally lit up, and [Wu Fuchun] continued to crawl forward anxiously.
0:53:58|0:54:11|However, as soon as he made a slightly larger movement, the accumulated snow would fall continuously, once again extinguishing the flames. In this way, [Wu Fuchun] kept extinguishing and lighting the lighter, switching back and forth between climbing forward.
0:54:11|0:54:29|At this moment, [Wu Fuchun] held up his right hand in hopes of creating hope for himself with his left hand. Thick frost clung to the tips of his hair and eyelashes, and each time the lighter went out, it brought him great fear. [Jing Ruyi] lay in bed, holding the Guanyin pendant solemnly in the palm of her hand.
0:54:42|0:55:0|[Wu Fuchun] lit the lighter again, holding the pickaxe and continuously poking the accumulated snow in front. Each action brought him infinite hope, yet filled with unknown despair. Later, he voluntarily extinguished the lighter, using both hands to pick up the pickaxe and continuously shovel the accumulated snow in front.
0:55:0|0:55:17|The snow in front of him had long since turned into ice, and after shoveling for a long time, not much debris fell. [Wu Fuchun] couldn't resist the anxiety in his heart, lit the lighter again, and the speed of chiseling the ice with one hand holding the lighter in his right hand slowed down a lot, and the flame went out again.
0:55:17|0:55:29|[Wu Fuchun] shed tears of despair, his hands frozen in place. He then dropped the lighter and began chiseling desperately with a pickaxe. Through the ice, a faint glimmer of light could now be seen.
0:55:29|0:55:39|The temperature in the small cabin remains at minus 5 degrees Celsius. [Jing Ruyi], with her lower body exposed, drags her weary legs towards the shelf against the wall where canned goods are placed.
0:55:39|0:55:57|[Jing Ruyi], holding her breath, supported her left foot while grabbing onto a piece of rotten floorboard with her right hand, trying to stand up. However, the dilapidated floorboard couldn't withstand the force of an adult. Just as [Jing Ruyi] managed to stand up, she toppled over sideways, causing cans to roll all over the floor, and she fell down again.
0:55:57|0:56:3|Outside the window, the snowstorm shows no sign of stopping, [Jing Ruyi] leans against the shelf with her legs stretched out.
0:56:4|0:56:23|Crying and eating canned food at the same time, [Jing Ruyi] looked nothing like her usual self. The food in her mouth fell as she cried, with no sign of the weather outside improving. The snow on the roof had already exceeded half a meter in thickness, and the sound of frost forming on the windows was unusually clear.
0:56:23|0:56:42|[Jing Ruyi] turned around in confusion, only to see the frost on the glass getting thicker and thicker, making it impossible to see the outside of the house. Dragging her legs, she crawled out of the wooden house, the temperature inside and outside incomparable. With bare legs rubbing against the snow, she persevered and managed to crawl towards the generator.
0:56:42|0:56:48|When [Jing Ruyi] finally reached it, she found the rope and pulled it out with the last bit of her strength.
0:56:53|0:57:8|[Jing Ruyi] is too weak to ignite the generator. She grasps the rope with both hands, grits her teeth, and pulls hard outward. The rope is unexpectedly torn apart. She is thrown to the ground by the tremendous force, still holding the half-broken rope in her hand.
0:57:8|0:57:30|On the other side, a pickaxe emerged from the snow, and [Wu Fuchun] finally crawled out from the crevice. He turned around and, with his last bit of strength, pulled his backpack out from under his feet. The blizzard had stopped, and the sunlight was shining unobstructed on the ground. [Jing Ruyi] leaned against the generator, looking up at the sky in a daze, calm yet despairing.
0:57:30|0:57:48|After a long time, she looked at the discarded tin cans on the wooden box, the sharp cans opening their mouths wantonly. She stared blankly at the can lid, another idea sprouted in her mind. Before long, [Jing Ruyi]'s arm weakly drooped down, still holding the sharp can lid.
0:57:48|0:58:7|After completing all this, [Jing Ruyi] leaned against the wall with her head tilted, gently closed her eyes, and her other hand paralyzed on the ground. The absence of [Wu Fuchun] made her completely desperate and the failed self-rescue left her with no courage to live on. She didn't know that she was now the only hope left in [Wu Fuchun]'s heart.
0:58:7|0:58:22|Once out of the ice crack, [Wu Fuchun] hurried back without stopping for a moment, not daring to pause until he joyfully rushed into the open doorway, only to find no trace of [Jing Ruyi]. He immediately ran towards the generator and saw the figure that haunted his dreams.
0:58:22|0:58:37|At this moment, [Jing Ruyi]'s face was unusually tranquil, leaning quietly to one side. [Wu Fuchun] crawled over to her, lifted her wrist, and saw the bloody wound that had been cut.
0:58:39|0:58:50|In the hopeful gaze of [Wu Fuchun], [Jing Ruyi] slowly opened her eyes. Upon seeing [Wu Fuchun]'s face, she revealed a faintly relieved yet weak smile.
0:58:54|0:59:7|[Wu Fuchun] listened to these words with such sadness that he was on the verge of tears. He bent his back and held [Jing Ruyi] tightly in his arms, refusing to let go. From that moment on, their hearts were closely intertwined and they were unwilling to be apart.
0:59:7|0:59:23|[Wu Fuchun] fixed the generator and cooked a pot of soup on a small electric stove, while [Jing Ruyi] wrapped herself in a blanket and fur coat and sat back down on the lower bunk. [Wu Fuchun] took back her gaze and carefully carried the packed lunchbox to the bedside, sitting on the stool next to the bed.
0:59:27|0:59:38|After the robbery, [Jing Ruyi] who was reborn seemed not joyful. She lowered her eyes with a face full of disappointment. After a long time, she slowly reached out her hands to take the fish soup.
0:59:38|0:59:49|She stared blankly at the lunchbox in her hand, without any desire to eat. Finally, she averted her gaze and slowly placed the fish soup on her lap, [Wu Fuchun] looked up with a sense of grievance.
0:59:52|1:0:1|She chuckled self-deprecatingly with her head down again, and [Jing Ruyi]'s eyes finally focused in this moment as she lifted her head to gaze steadily at [Wu Fuchun].
1:0:2|1:0:8|[Wu Fuchun] looked at [Jing Ruyi] earnestly, with a hint of tears in his eyes.
1:0:10|1:0:26|At this moment, [Jing Ruyi] was already in tears, unable to look into the eyes of [Wu Fuchun]. [Wu Fuchun] held back his tears, his eyes filled with determination and perseverance. The snowstorm finally stopped, the dark clouds slowly dispersed, and peace returned to the front of the wooden house.
1:0:27|1:0:37|[Wu Fuchun] packed his bags again and prepared to leave. He looked back at the bed uneasily, while [Jing Ruyi] lay motionless on the side facing the wall.
1:0:37|1:0:48|[Wu Fuchun] knew she was still upset about his late return. Thinking about this, [Wu Fuchun] placed his backpack on the table and sat by the table, staring expressionlessly at this figure from behind.
1:1:1|1:1:9|After saying these words, [Wu Fuchun] quietly waited for a response from [Jing Ruyi], who remained motionless, only slowly opening her eyes.
1:1:9|1:1:31|[Wu Fuchun] walked out of the house without looking back after picking up his backpack, while [Jing Ruyi] silently pondered every word he had said, imagining everything [Wu Fuchun] had experienced that day. All that was done for the survival of the two of them.
1:1:31|1:1:40|Wu Fuchun, who narrowly escaped death, returned to the wooden house. He carefully inventoried all the remaining supplies in the house while also taking care of the weakened Jing Ruyi.
1:1:54|1:2:12|The thirty-fourth number on the wall has also been marked, and time is running out for them on the shoe stool. [Wu Fuchun] walks in the snow, looking down from above, only seeing a small black dot. Without a face mask, his nose has turned bright red from the cold, and his eyes are showing signs of discomfort.
1:2:12|1:2:22|Wu Fuchun blinked hard, trying to ease the discomfort, then squinted and looked around. Holding a pickaxe, Wu Fuchun walked forward slowly.
1:2:22|1:2:33|The discomfort in his eyes grew stronger, eventually forcing Wu Fuchun to stop and squint hard. His eyes continued to ignore the urge to blink, and upon closer inspection, one could see that his eyelids were bright red.
1:2:33|1:2:44|Conjunctival congestion, in order to relieve the pain, he grabbed two clumps of snow and pressed them against his eyes in an attempt to alleviate it. When he put down the snowballs, his eyes could hardly open.
1:2:44|1:2:56|He tried to squint his eyes, but found his vision blurred, only able to perceive light. Tears kept streaming down his face as he stared ahead in confusion, realizing after a while that he couldn't even recognize the direction.
1:2:56|1:3:15|Thinking of this, [Wu Fuchun] immediately crawled on the ground in a panic to search for the pickaxe. In front of him was a downhill road, but [Wu Fuchun] was completely unaware. He slipped and rolled down directly. Without the pickaxe at this moment, he could only let inertia carry him downhill. The heavy backpack made [Wu Fuchun] stand for a long time before he could get up.
1:3:15|1:3:30|Antarctica has very high visibility on sunny days. From the small wooden house, [Wu Fuchun] can clearly see that he hasn't left the house for long. Anxious to return, he stands in place for a while, pondering.
1:3:30|1:3:54|Finally identifying a direction, [Wu Fuchun] cautiously took a step forward, extending one leg to test the ground. After confirming the stability of this step, he dared to tremble as he took another step. With wide eyes, he tried to discern the general direction of the wooden house, looking around in confusion and uncertainty, although the wooden house should have been within his sight.
1:3:54|1:4:4|He couldn't find his way home, with the red thread on his woolen hat swaying back and forth, coupled with this tearless expression, he looked like a child who couldn't find his way home.
1:4:40|1:4:52|The response was like a beam of light, and he suddenly turned around and ran wildly in the direction of the sound.
1:5:13|1:5:23|[Wu Fuchun] finally let go of all his fears at this moment. He reached out and held [Jing Ruyi]'s hand, kneeling on the stairs by the wooden door, slowly moving closer to her.
1:5:23|1:5:42|[Jing Ruyi] reached out and cupped [Wu Fuchun]'s face in her hands, looking at his wind-chapped cheeks and lifeless eyes for a long time. Finally, she gently embraced him, and [Wu Fuchun] leaned on [Jing Ruyi]'s shoulder like a child.
1:5:42|1:5:50|[Wu Fuchun] The pain and grievances of this period finally burst out unrestrained at this moment.
1:5:58|1:6:5|She wrapped a snowball in gauze and gently pressed it against Wu Fuchun's eyes.
1:6:14|1:6:22|[Wu Fuchun] has been exhausted recently. He closed his eyes and fell asleep right after speaking.
1:6:25|1:6:44|[Jing Ruyi] looked at [Wu Fuchun]'s face and gently stroked his hair. The past exaggeration and emotions were worn away by this disaster, but life still had to go on. On that day, [Wu Fuchun] improvised by pouring a basin of snow into the cooking pot.
1:6:49|1:6:54|[Wu Fuchun] obediently turned a corner, avoiding the pillar in front and continued walking forward.
1:6:56|1:7:1|[Wu Fuchun] followed the command, changed direction again, and continued walking while kicking.
1:7:4|1:7:14|[Wu Fuchun] poured all the hot water from the pot into the basin in front of [Jing Ruyi], then placed the basin on the wooden table nearby and leaned against the table corner to rest.
1:7:23|1:7:29|[Wu Fuchun] glared indignantly at [Jing Ruyi], then turned around and walked forward with quick steps.
1:7:31|1:7:42|[Jing Ruyi] watched as [Wu Fuchun] clumsily moved, a small smile involuntarily appearing on his lips. Then, without hesitation, he picked up a small pair of scissors and cut off his own hair.
1:7:42|1:8:1|For [Jing Ruyi] and [Wu Fuchun], it was a new beginning. She picked up the jar and poured the hot water from the basin over her head, then closed her eyes lightly, feeling the warmth of the water. After washing her hair, she squeezed out the water, then sat on the bench with her legs bent, using a towel to wipe her shins.
1:8:1|1:8:19|She secretly glanced at [Wu Fuchun], only to see [Wu Fuchun] obediently squatting at the door with his back to her, which made her feel a little strange. She noticed some red spots on the inside of his arm, and after a simple bath, [Jing Ruyi] asked [Wu Fuchun] to sit back on the bench and carefully trimmed his beard.
1:8:33|1:8:45|[Jing Ruyi] stopped her movements, looking gently into [Wu Fuchun]'s eyes, unaware that [Wu Fuchun] could clearly see her eyes through the gauze strip. A smile appeared on his face.
1:8:45|1:8:59|Infected, [Jing Ruyi] also smirked. [Wu Fuchun] carefully touched [Jing Ruyi]'s face, pushing her stray hair aside, then nervously swallowed. Holding [Jing Ruyi]'s face, he slowly bent down, causing [Jing Ruyi] to furrow her brow.
1:9:2|1:9:6|[Jing Ruyi] felt embarrassed and plunged into [Wu Fuchun]'s chest.
1:9:9|1:9:25|On that day, Wu Fuchun, who had lost his sunglasses, acquired a new piece of equipment, which was Jing Ruyi's underwear. Wu Fuchun fastened the underwear over his eyes.
1:9:28|1:9:36|Ruyi chuckled indulgently, then lowered her head to earnestly write and draw on the notebook.
1:9:47|1:9:59|Ruyi looked up in surprise, only to find Wu Fuchun's gaze fixed on her chest. She quickly sat up straight and covered her open collar, but in fact, Wu Fuchun was not looking at her chest.
1:9:59|1:10:19|Only to see him with a solemn expression, kneeling straight with hands clasped in front of him, devoutly closing his eyes, [Wu Fuchun] then noticed the Guanyin pendant hanging on her neck. Holding the pendant and looking at the man who was devoutly worshipping in front of her, [Jing Ruyi] was finally moved. She suppressed her emotions and solemnly held up the pendant to [Wu Fuchun].
1:10:19|1:10:37|[Wu Fuchun], after getting enough rest, packed up his belongings and headed towards the door. At this moment, a fierce snowstorm was raging outside. Suddenly, [Wu Fuchun]'s hand, reaching for the door latch, hesitated and then pulled back. He took a few steps back, standing in a place where Ruyi could see him. Ruyi sat on the bed, looking towards [Wu Fuchun].
1:10:39|1:10:48|[Wu Fuchun] stood at the door without saying a word, but the words were like a shot of adrenaline, lodging in his heart. He opened the door without hesitation, and the strong wind and snow immediately blew the wooden door open.
1:10:56|1:11:7|[Wu Fuchun] stood in front, braving the snow as he walked out of the wooden house. He buttoned his undershirt over his eyes, acting as sunglasses, and [Wu Fuchun] looked around, getting used to the environment in front of him.
1:11:7|1:11:18|Following the planned direction, with less and less time left for them, he must seize every opportunity to go out. This time, [Wu Fuchun] was much slower.
1:11:18|1:11:30|He walked cautiously in the snow, and after some time, the seabirds around caught the attention of [Wu Fuchun]. He saw the seabirds circling above the mountain peak for a moment before flying further away.
1:11:30|1:11:41|[Wu Fuchun] continued to walk in the direction where the seabirds flew, basking in the warm sun. As he climbed a hill and looked down, he spotted a chubby seal that was not afraid of humans.
1:11:41|1:11:52|Even when seeing [Wu Fuchun], [Jing Ruyi] lazily pats [Wu Fuchun] on the tail, then sits down next to the seal, lifts the eye mask and blinks hard, and finally lazily lies down in the snow.
1:12:30|1:12:37|[Wu Fuchun] looked affectionately at the seal twisting and turning beside him, holding onto his gloves.
1:12:42|1:13:0|The seal seemed to understand Wu Fuchun's muttering, raised its head and gave him a disdainful look. Inside the wooden house, Jing Ruyi was sitting on the bed, holding a small mirror and carefully examining herself. Her lips were already dry and peeling, and the dark circles under her eyes were getting worse, even so.
1:13:0|1:13:19|She still tried to bring a smile to her face, while [Wu Fuchun] was curiously sticking his butt out to observe the fish swimming beneath the ice. In order to see more clearly, he was lying quite low. These fish were ready-made food in [Wu Fuchun]'s eyes, until he saw a giant whale swimming past the ice surface.
1:13:19|1:13:33|His face turned ashen in an instant, [Wu Fuchun] remained motionless, quietly lying on the ice waiting for the departure of this huge creature. The ice, already cracked, shattered under the tail swipe of a giant whale.
1:13:33|1:13:51|[Wu Fuchun] didn't have time to escape. He sat on the ground in a panic, shuffling back a few steps, and fell directly into the water. The sea water was swift and unfathomable. His eye protection underwear and woolen hat were washed away, and unfortunately, one of [Wu Fuchun]'s shoes also fell into the deep sea and disappeared without a trace.
1:13:51|1:14:8|But at this moment, [Wu Fuchun] was too preoccupied to care about these. He exerted all his strength to swim to the uppermost level, but due to the refraction of light causing visual distortion, he brushed past the ice cave and collided with the ice layer. Helpless, he had to swim to another place to continue searching for an exit.
1:14:8|1:14:28|However, no matter how many times he tried, he still only hit the ice surface and couldn't see the exit clearly. [Wu Fuchun] had never been so desperate, and the prolonged breath-holding led to lack of oxygen in his brain. He finally exhaled his last breath, [Wu Fuchun] helplessly opened his eyes, hands still raised above his head, slowly sinking towards the seabed.
1:14:28|1:14:44|Suddenly, some magical creatures resembling torpedoes swiftly entered the seabed, swimming agilely. They circled around [Wu Fuchun] before diving towards the ground. He looked up in confusion and saw these penguins all rushing in the same direction.
1:14:44|1:15:7|That was the exit, [Wu Fuchun] seemed to see the hope of life, desperately swinging his arms towards the direction of the penguins, holding his breath, he managed to swing his limbs with sheer willpower, effortlessly swimming upstream as these little penguins easily leaped out of the ice, waddling forward. With their help, [Wu Fuchun] finally clung to the ice surface, panting for several breaths.
1:15:7|1:15:16|Still struggling to climb out, [Wu Fuchun] curled up on the ice, shivering with arms crossed, hat, backpack, and shoes all gone.
1:15:16|1:15:43|It has become extremely difficult for [Wu Fuchun] to survive here. He is seen staggering forward barefoot, desperately opening his coat pocket to take out a few fruit candies. [Wu Fuchun]'s hands are already frozen, unable to tear open the candy wrappers. Accidentally, he drops the candy on the ground and struggles to pick it up. Trembling, he puts it in his mouth and chews. These fruit candies are his only source of energy at the moment.
1:15:43|1:16:0|In the blink of an eye, the weather in Antarctica turned windy and snowy again. [Wu Fuchun] didn't know how long he had been walking, and now he was crossing a plain after passing through a hill. Without the protection of anti-skid boots, his right foot had already frozen stiff, and his clothes had been frozen into a block by the wind and snow.
1:16:0|1:16:18|With frost on his eyebrows and eyelashes, his face stiff and eyes unfocused, [Wu Fuchun] relied on sheer determination, subconsciously swaying his body. He knew he couldn't collapse, as someone was waiting for him to come home. And so, [Wu Fuchun] braved the biting cold wind, step by step, making his way home.
1:16:19|1:16:28|At this moment, [Jing Ruyi] is lying on the bed pretending to sleep, suddenly awakened by the sound of the generator outside. She opens her eyes and looks at the electric heater.
1:16:30|1:16:46|[Wu Fuchun] trembled as he walked into the room, closed the door and leaned on the shelf. Limping through the doorway, [Wu Fuchun]'s face had turned a dark purple from the cold. Upon seeing [Jing Ruyi] safe and sound, he could no longer hold on and collapsed straight to the ground.
1:16:55|1:17:8|[Jing Ruyi] knelt beside [Wu Fuchun], immediately helping him remove his clothes and gloves as he lay unconscious on the ground. Allowing [Jing Ruyi] to manipulate him, [Jing Ruyi] propped up [Wu Fuchun]'s upper body and tossed aside the ski suit frozen into an ice shell.
1:17:8|1:17:19|On the side, she also pulled off the damp down jacket from inside, then she untied [Wu Fuchun]'s shoes, took off his socks, and his right foot, without a shoe, had long been frozen into a dark purple color.
1:17:19|1:17:31|At this moment, [Jing Ruyi] looked at [Wu Fuchun] with worry and fear in her eyes. She calmly took off her coat, realizing that the only way to save him at this moment might be to keep each other warm.
1:17:32|1:17:50|[Wu Fuchun] transformed like this for his own sake. [Jing Ruyi] stripped off all her clothes, pressed her naked body against [Wu Fuchun]'s freezing red chest, rested her head on his chest, slowly transferring her body heat to him. [Jing Ruyi] closed her eyes, hugged [Wu Fuchun] tightly, and fell asleep.
1:17:50|1:18:4|After the wind and snow stopped, the dark clouds dispersed, and the sun once again hung high in the sky over the Antarctic. The wooden cabin was bathed in warm sunlight, and the electric heater was still glowing. [Jing Ruyi] and [Wu Fuchun] lay on the floor next to the square table, still asleep.
1:18:4|1:18:17|[Jing Ruyi] carefully laid a blanket on the ground and covered both of them with it. By now, the chill on [Wu Fuchun]'s body had faded away, and his skin color returned to normal. He opened his eyes in confusion and stared blankly for a moment.
1:18:17|1:18:29|After confirming that he was still alive, [Wu Fuchun] took a deep breath and stared blankly at the ceiling. In these few short seconds, he had already replayed everything that had happened in his mind.
1:18:29|1:18:39|Without moving a muscle, he quietly turned his head to look at the girl lying naked next to him, still sound asleep. [Wu Fuchun] abandoned his usual arrogant demeanor.
1:18:39|1:18:52|Indulgently gazing at the sleeping face of [Jing Ruyi], he couldn't help but smile slightly, then nervously swallowed his saliva, inching his head closer to [Jing Ruyi], but just as [Wu Fuchun] was about to kiss [Jing Ruyi].
1:18:52|1:19:4|Suddenly smelling an unknown odor, Wu Fuchun rushed up to the ski suit next to the electric heater in one swift step, holding the ski suit in his arms. A large hole had already been burned on the shoulder.
1:19:4|1:19:15|Through this big hole, he saw the awakened [Jing Ruyi], [Wu Fuchun] looked at the hole that had already started to fly away with a heartache, responding to [Jing Ruyi] with an puzzled look, after [Jing Ruyi] turned her head away as if avoiding suspicion.
1:19:15|1:19:33|He understood the look in [Jing Ruyi]'s eyes just now, quickly covering his lower body with clothes. The two looked at each other in silence. With his ski suit torn, [Wu Fuchun] could only wrap himself in a thick blanket. On that day, he kept digging in the snow with a shovel. Gradually, a black shoe sole emerged. [Wu Fuchun] stopped moving.
1:19:38|1:19:53|[Wu Fuchun] carefully used both hands to cover up Natasha's feet with snow. He took off Natasha's boots and put them on his own feet. These unremarkable non-slip boots were actually a crucial factor in their survival.
1:19:55|1:20:14|The sudden knocking at the door startled [Wu Fuchun] and he immediately stood up. Feeling a bit panicked, he dropped the lunch box and rushed to the door. [Jing Ruyi] also stood up anxiously. As [Wu Fuchun] opened the wooden door, he was instantly chilled to the bone. He carefully scanned the surroundings but found nothing.
1:20:14|1:20:30|[Jing Ruyi] looked worriedly at the door while [Wu Fuchun] stood at the door looking around for a long time, but didn't see anyone. He was wearing a sweater that couldn't withstand the cold wind at the door, and after a while, he slowly closed the door.
1:20:31|1:20:38|[Jing Ruyi] anxiously shifted her gaze from the door to the window.
1:20:42|1:20:54|Ruyi furrowed her brows and suddenly remembered the shoes of the little deer.
1:20:56|1:21:6|The two of them stared at the door without blinking, but when the wooden door was blown open, they were so scared that they lost their wits. [Wu Fuchun] jumped onto the table and curled up into a ball.
1:21:6|1:21:18|Ruyi pulled [Wu Fuchun] and buried her head tightly in his arms. [Wu Fuchun] then picked up the lunchbox beside him and held it above his head, bravely staring at the door without blinking. At this moment, their nerves were stretched like bowstrings.
1:21:18|1:21:29|At any moment it could break, a gray figure can be seen through the frame, passing through the entrance, walking towards the room, a chubby little penguin appears in front of the two.
1:21:29|1:21:50|[Wu Fuchun] and Ruyi burst into laughter when they see the little penguin, who shows no fear at all. As the humans wobble towards the center and look around, the penguin walks around the room. [Wu Fuchun] quickly jumps off the table, picks up the clothes on the table, and carefully approaches the penguin, who is curiously observing.
1:22:5|1:22:12|Wu Fuchun looked at the chubby penguin in front of him unwillingly, then glanced at Jing Ruyi.
1:22:12|1:22:29|Dejectedly throwing the clothes on the ground, sitting at the end of the bed in a huff, the silly penguin curiously looked at the clothes in front of it, stretched its neck and poked its head in. [Wu Fuchun] looked eagerly at the little penguin covered with clothes, unable to help but blink his eyes.
1:22:34|1:22:41|The little penguin hit a pillar and fell down in a daze, with [Wu Fuchun] looking at the penguin helplessly.
1:22:51|1:23:2|[Wu Fuchun] frowned and looked disapprovingly at Ruyi, then shifted his gaze to the penguin. The little penguin stood obediently in front of [Wu Fuchun], who looked back at Ruyi with a face full of coquettishness and pleading expression.
1:23:26|1:23:33|[Wu Fuchun] reached out to touch the chubby one but got pecked instead. However, it hopped in front of [Jing Ruyi] and let her pat its head.
1:23:36|1:24:0|[Wu Fuchun] looked at the chattering bird and person with a smile on his face. Time waits for no one. [Wu Fuchun] once again set out to find the Antarctic research station. [Jing Ruyi]'s leg had improved after a long period of rest. In his spare time, [Wu Fuchun] even made a simple crutch for him to use. The chubby penguin successfully joined the family and mischievously wandered around while [Wu Fuchun] cooked.
1:24:0|1:24:12|Pecking at his legs, a game that the two of them often play with great pleasure. Every time the two are at home, they will seek direction and redefine it. [Wu Fuchun] will also offer some constructive suggestions based on experience.
1:24:12|1:24:24|[Wu Fuchun] still slept on the upper bunk. Every time [Jing Ruyi] woke up, the look in her eyes towards the upper bunk was no longer cold and indifferent, but filled with tenderness. She reached out her hand and quietly touched the fingertips of [Wu Fuchun] hanging down.
1:24:24|1:24:35|Time flies, [Jing Ruyi] can finally stand steady with a cane. With the help of [Wu Fuchun], [Jing Ruyi] took a few steps with the cane, and 48 days passed in the blink of an eye.
1:24:35|1:24:44|[Wu Fuchun] stood on the mountaintop, looking out. He brought a sled and had [Jing Ruyi] sit on it, pushing her quickly towards the top of the slope.
1:24:59|1:25:15|Little Fatty still enjoys pecking at [Wu Fuchun]'s buttocks while he cooks. During this time, the two are not obsessed with finding the research station, but rather prefer to spend a lot of time with each other. [Wu Fuchun] picks up a fish and throws it far away, watching Little Fatty stagger, creating a unique charm.
1:25:15|1:25:25|55 days have passed, and the food is getting scarcer. [Wu Fuchun] quietly leaves the canned food for [Jing Ruyi].
1:25:26|1:25:38|[Wu Fuchun] puts the fish back into [Jing Ruyi]'s bowl, using a diminished tone to disguise his care. After the meal, [Wu Fuchun] gathers all the empty cans and bottles into a box and throws them outside the wooden house.
1:25:38|1:25:48|On the diesel tank beside, the clear scale shows that there is only a little diesel left. [Wu Fuchun] occasionally pushes the sled, taking [Jing Ruyi] to the nearby hillside to relax.
1:25:48|1:26:6|On this day, the two sat side by side at the edge of the snowy cliff. Suddenly, [Jing Ruyi] felt blood flowing from her nostrils, and she understood what it meant. Leaning slowly on [Wu Fuchun]'s shoulder, [Wu Fuchun] smiled, embraced [Jing Ruyi]'s shoulder, and held her tighter.
1:26:6|1:26:22|The poster has been filled with [Jing Ruyi]'s paintings, she divided the south into 30 directions. [Wu Fuchun] searched for a full 60 days, but still found nothing. One day, after [Wu Fuchun] went out, he stood in the snow holding a black stone, carefully examining it.
1:27:24|1:27:30|[Wu Fuchun] handed the stone to [Jing Ruyi] as if presenting a treasure, and [Jing Ruyi] took the stone and examined it for a while.
1:27:40|1:27:47|Suddenly, it seemed as if a stone at the bottom had melted and sunk in, and [Wu Fuchun] couldn't help but lean in to smell it.
1:28:10|1:28:30|[Wu Fuchun]’s ecstatic smile suddenly froze on his face, [Jing Ruyi] realized and quickly covered her nose, but the blood still couldn't stop flowing. She lowered her head, frantically wiping the nosebleed. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't clean it up. Looking at [Wu Fuchun] with a hint of sadness in her eyes, she still mustered up the spirit to smile reassuringly at him.
1:28:31|1:28:39|[Wu Fuchun] lies facing the wall, while [Jing Ruyi] faces inside the room with a hint of confusion in her eyes.
1:30:21|1:30:32|[Wu Fuchun] lay on his back, covering his eyes with his arm, trying hard to hold back tears. After saying these words, [Jing Ruyi] also sadly buried her head in the pillow.
1:30:32|1:30:45|Suddenly, [Wu Fuchun] seemed to have made a decision. He climbed down from above, lit a candlestick and placed it on a wooden table. Behind the candlestick was a statue of the Virgin Mary. [Wu Fuchun] knelt in front of [Jing Ruyi] with one knee.
1:31:23|1:31:31|[Jing Ruyi] looked at [Wu Fuchun] in front of her, choked up and unable to speak. [Wu Fuchun] made a gesture of holding a ring box in the air and raised it in front of her.
1:31:44|1:31:49|[Wu Fuchun] carefully took out the imaginary ring from the box and held it up in front of [Jing Ruyi].
1:32:54|1:33:11|[Jing Ruyi] cried uncontrollably, reluctant to look at [Wu Fuchun] in front of her, and couldn't help but throw herself into his arms. [Wu Fuchun] held [Jing Ruyi] firmly, refusing to let go, and at that moment they no longer needed to hide their emotions. They cried openly and honestly, for them
1:33:11|1:33:30|Time is incredibly cruel. In the blink of an eye, 75 days have passed. The diesel is running out, and the light of the electric heater gradually dims and finally disappears. The wind and snow pick up outside again, the temperature drops sharply. Without diesel, the generator loses power and, after a few stalls, slowly comes to a stop.
1:33:30|1:33:43|The cruel issue of survival hung over the two like the sword of Damocles once again, with the wind and snow raging outside. [Wu Fuchun] could no longer stay safely at home, they must make a desperate effort to find a way out.
1:33:44|1:33:59|In the room, [Jing Ruyi] packs up the luggage for [Wu Fuchun], then takes out a booklet from her pocket. [Wu Fuchun] looks at [Jing Ruyi] for a while, then slowly reaches out to take the booklet she handed over.
1:34:8|1:34:20|Fuchun looked at [Jing Ruyi] with eyes so gentle they could squeeze out water. Then, under [Jing Ruyi]'s expectant gaze, he opened the book, a collection of poems, with many markings made by [Jing Ruyi] in the blank spaces.
1:34:40|1:34:50|Time cannot be wasted for a moment, Wu Fuchun once again embarked on the journey to find the research station.
1:35:14|1:35:23|[Jing Ruyi]'s teeth have started to fall out.
1:35:48|1:36:3|He took off his shoes, endured the intense pain, and moved his already blackened toes, hoping to persevere a little longer. Exhausted from searching for a way, he sat on a rock, watching the waves crashing against the giant rocks ahead.
1:36:11|1:36:16|Wu Fuchun discovered a huge whale skeleton and stood next to it.
1:36:18|1:36:30|Wu Fuchun couldn't contain the despair in his heart, looking at the skeleton with a sense of hopelessness, then turning to face the turbulent sea. The waves kept crashing onto the shore, in an endless cycle.
1:36:31|1:36:43|The hollow eye sockets of the skeleton gazed calmly at him, the wind blowing through the bones making a rustling sound. Fuchun closed his eyes, trying to feel his most genuine thoughts deep inside.
1:36:43|1:37:7|He quickly found the answer, took out a shovel and began to dig the snow under his feet with force. At this time, the sky over Antarctica was clear, but the bright sunlight couldn't warm his chest. Soon a large pit was dug, this was the final resting place in Fuchun's heart. He calmly lay in the pit, later Fuchun carried [Jing Ruyi] back to the seaside, [Jing Ruyi] leaned tightly against Fuchun.
1:37:7|1:37:10|Both Wu Fuchun and Jing Ruyi looked at the sea in the distance, neither of them said a word.
1:37:15|1:37:21|Ruyi looked ahead with a melancholy expression, and [Wu Fuchun] pursed his lips and pondered for a while before speaking.
1:37:42|1:37:50|Ruyi greedily gazes at the sky and glaciers in front of her.
1:38:4|1:38:10|[Wu Fuchun] tears streamed down his face, trembling as he forcibly held back from crying out loud.
1:38:36|1:38:47|Ruyi leaned against [Wu Fuchun] with relief, savoring their final moments together. 70 days ago, [Wu Fuchun] gave her a reason to live, and now it was her turn to bring him the final belief.
1:38:47|1:39:5|In the end, [Wu Fuchun] listened to her advice. He walked forward with a backpack on his back, braving the wind and snow, taking one step at a time. Suddenly, he stopped in his tracks, hesitated, and turned around. Looking back, not far behind him was a cabin, and at the door of the cabin stood the person he loved the most.
1:39:5|1:39:16|[Wu Fuchun] pursed his lips, lowered his eyes, and couldn't help but glance deeply at Ruyi before turning away in pain. The injury on his right foot was getting worse, so [Wu Fuchun] could only limp forward.
1:39:16|1:39:29|Ruyi didn't return to the house until she couldn't see the figure of [Wu Fuchun]. She glanced at the stove that had never been lit again, limped back to the wooden house, and [Wu Fuchun]'s will to survive was not as strong as before.
1:39:29|1:39:47|Ruyi's physical condition was the biggest blow to him, and he knew that Ruyi didn't want to become a burden to him at the last moment. Fuchun walked in the snow, occasionally looking back, unaware that [Jing Ruyi] was sitting in the wooden house, his eyes never leaving the place where he disappeared.
1:39:47|1:40:9|During this time alone, [Jing Ruyi] tore down the poster and placed it by the seat, repeatedly caressing the areas she had drawn, the numbers marked by arrows. His mouth had already cracked in several places, his spirits not as high as before. Meanwhile, [Wu Fuchun] faced the wind and snow, searching for the final way out in this countdown.
1:40:9|1:40:28|The weather in Antarctica turned bad again, [Wu Fuchun] dragged his backpack against the fierce storm, struggling to move forward. The bone-chilling ice shards cut like blades on his face, and the clothes wrapped around his body could only be piled up around his neck. The strong wind made it impossible for him to move forward, and the backpack in his hand was blown away without a trace.
1:40:28|1:40:42|He propped himself up with his hands, crawling forward bit by bit against the storm. In these over 70 days, [Wu Fuchun] had never encountered such harsh weather. The fierce wind, accompanied by heavy snow, mercilessly slapped against his face.
1:40:45|1:41:2|The strong wind blew [Wu Fuchun] up and he flew backwards. Instinctively, he reached out in all directions and finally managed to stabilize himself on the ground. At this moment, [Wu Fuchun] couldn't even open his eyes. He gritted his teeth, stepped his foot into the snow, and lay down as close to the ground as possible.
1:41:2|1:41:18|The blizzard continued, and soon the visibility around was almost zero, [Wu Fuchun] was nowhere to be seen. After an unknown amount of time, the blizzard finally stopped, [Wu Fuchun] was almost completely covered by snow, with only half of his head exposed.
1:41:19|1:41:35|The piercing sound and icy touch brought [Wu Fuchun] back to consciousness. His eyelashes trembled slightly as a penguin stood in front of him, tilting its head curiously to observe him.
1:41:36|1:41:48|The penguin called out twice to [Wu Fuchun], seemingly indicating for him to move forward. Then it turned around and staggered ahead, revealing the wind vane on its back. [Wu Fuchun] stood still for a moment.
1:41:48|1:41:58|Hastily propping up his arm and crawling forward, wanting to see clearly, the penguin walked and stopped, occasionally turning its head to look, as if confirming whether Wu Fuchun was following it.
1:41:58|1:42:15|It brought [Wu Fuchun] to the side of the wind vane, looking at [Wu Fuchun], then gestured for him to look down. Following the penguin's gaze, he saw several colorful steel houses. The penguin accompanied [Wu Fuchun] for a while, understanding that it had completed its mission, and then wobbled away.
1:42:15|1:42:27|The penguin waddled forward, swaying its head from side to side. Suddenly, it stopped in its tracks, as if sensing the gaze of Wu Fuchun. It turned its head to look at Wu Fuchun, leaving behind a trail of small footprints like maple leaves.
1:42:36|1:42:53|[Wu Fuchun] could only muster enough strength to make it to the nearest house. He collapsed weakly next to the seven of clubs, frustratedly hitting his own legs. He bent down to pick up a stone and began desperately pounding on the paint bucket behind him, trying to get the examiner's attention.
1:43:6|1:43:11|[Wu Fuchun] collapsed on the ground, then looked unwillingly towards the nearby colored steel house.
1:43:40|1:43:57|In the moment of despair for [Wu Fuchun], a group of people in orange ski suits rushed towards him. He stiffly turned his head to the side, looking bewildered. In that moment, there were not only tears in [Wu Fuchun]'s eyes, but also a glimmer of light shining. It wasn't just himself, but also [Jing Ruyi], who was saved.
1:43:57|1:44:4|Four researchers hurriedly took [Wu Fuchun] on a heavy snow vehicle towards the small wooden house, with [Wu Fuchun] sitting inside.
1:44:4|1:44:22|At the thought of seeing [Jing Ruyi] soon, his mouth couldn't help but curl up, the snowmobile raced at full speed, sometimes along the seaside, sometimes across the snowfield, the vehicle rushed towards the wooden house without stopping, suddenly the driver slammed on the brakes, causing everyone to stumble.
1:44:22|1:44:40|The snow-capped mountain in front suddenly triggered an avalanche, with snow blocks roaring and rolling down like a tsunami. The wooden cabin was only a few kilometers away from the foot of the mountain. The researchers had no time to think about a rapid retreat. It was then that [Wu Fuchun] saw the illusion behind through the car window.
1:44:40|1:44:44|The snowmobile raced forward at a speed matching that of the avalanche,
1:44:47|1:45:5|[Wu Fuchun] opened the car door and tried to rush out, but was firmly grabbed by two members of the scientific expedition team. At this moment, all he could see was a vast expanse of white, and he could no longer see the shadow of the wooden house. [Wu Fuchun] stood still, staring ahead blankly. He thought of the people in the wooden house waiting for him to come home, and he recklessly wanted to rush down.
1:45:6|1:45:14|Two expedition members quickly grabbed [Wu Fuchun]'s shoulders and dragged him back, knowing better than anyone the terror of an avalanche.
1:45:18|1:45:34|[Wu Fuchun] lay on the side of the car door, wailing in despair towards the direction of the avalanche. Several members of the expedition team could only hold on to [Wu Fuchun] tightly and lead him away from this dangerous place.
1:45:34|1:46:0|In his dream, [Wu Fuchun] repeatedly saw this scene. That day, he carefully placed the candlestick on the wooden table, illuminating the face of the Virgin Mary. Inside the small wooden house, he knelt on one knee, gently took her hand, and devoutly put the imaginary ring on the ring finger of [Jing Ruyi]. After putting on the ring, [Wu Fuchun] raised his hand to lift the white veil covering [Jing Ruyi]'s head. [Jing Ruyi] then lowered her head to look into [Wu Fuchun]'s eyes.
1:46:0|1:46:4|After completing everything with the shy little girl, [Wu Fuchun] also looked affectionately at [Jing Ruyi].
1:46:6|1:46:21|At this moment, their eyes were only on each other. Then [Wu Fuchun] slowly leaned towards [Jing Ruyi] and gently brushed her lips. [Wu Fuchun] lay on the hospital bed, opening his eyes blankly. The room was dark, but occasionally a streak of light would pass over his cheeks.
1:46:21|1:46:43|[Wu Fuchun] turned to look out the window, at this moment the white day in Antarctica had completely passed, and polar night had arrived. The aurora floated lightly, sometimes dim and sometimes bright. Emitting a blue-green light from deep to shallow, [Wu Fuchun] seemed to understand the truth that [Jing Ruyi] was studying at this moment, he stared fixedly at the splendid aurora outside the window.
1:46:43|1:46:54|The brilliant light illuminated the eyes of [Wu Fuchun], revealing not only the shock of beauty, but also his endless yearning. He leaned towards the edge of the bed, yet his eyes were reluctant to move away from the aurora.
1:46:54|1:47:6|Because [Jing Ruyi] has deeply engraved the aurora in his heart, thinking of this, [Wu Fuchun] sadly lowers his eyes, drifting to the other side, that is the ski suit he is wearing, also [Jing Ruyi]'s ski suit.
1:47:6|1:47:19|[Wu Fuchun] gently stroked the ski suit, then took out the Antarctic survival guide that [Jing Ruyi] gave him from the outer pocket. [Wu Fuchun] flipped through a few pages, carefully drawing two lines in red pen next to each note.
1:47:19|1:47:40|At this moment, [Wu Fuchun] trembled as he held the survival manual, unable to control his emotions and bent down to cry. He forced back his tears and turned a few more pages, only to find the Guanyin pendant that [Jing Ruyi] had always worn around her neck lying quietly in the manual. He took the jade pendant out of the manual and held it in his hand, examining it carefully.
1:47:40|1:47:56|Suddenly thinking of the day when [Jing Ruyi] saved him with her body temperature, he made the most sincere promise to Guanyin. [Wu Fuchun] looked out the window and saw the familiar scene again, she loved this land. He didn't believe that [Jing Ruyi] would just sit and wait to die in the cabin.
1:47:56|1:48:4|So [Wu Fuchun] escaped and rode a snowmobile all the way, quickly arriving at a snowy slope.
1:48:4|1:48:24|The road here is rugged and often has protruding rocks. Despite increasing the horsepower, the snow keeps flipping out from under the wheels without any progress. [Wu Fuchun] limps towards the hillside. This is the meeting place he and [Jing Ruyi] agreed upon.
1:48:34|1:48:42|[Wu Fuchun] knelt down in front of the snow pit and saw [Jing Ruyi] lying inside as if asleep.
1:48:50|1:48:55|[Wu Fuchun] held [Jing Ruyi]'s hand and looked into her eyes with deep affection.
