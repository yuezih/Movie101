0:0:20|0:0:36|At night, a soldier celebrates loudly in the street shirtless, after years he can finally return to his hometown. Then, on January 8, 1919, the Paris Peace Conference was held with 27 victorious countries from World War I.
0:0:44|0:0:53|In the Palace of Versailles in Paris, British Prime Minister [George] Lowe and French Prime Minister Crinoso are deep in conversation, each with their own intentions to divide some benefits. China, as one of the victorious countries, has the right to participate in the meeting. At this time, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, [Gu Weijun], is on his way.
0:1:8|0:1:22|He will represent China in the negotiations, dressed in a suit with a checkered tie at the collar. The suit is broad and sleek, complementing [Gu Weijun]'s demeanor perfectly. He sits calmly in the car, looking very confident.
0:1:22|0:1:32|Tensions rose at the negotiation table, with the British and French representatives disagreeing. Xiao Kejian slammed the table in anger, then stormed out, leaving the rest of the people furious.
0:1:32|0:1:50|The next day at the meeting, after the Japanese Makino Shinken finished reading, Fa Yingyi raised her hand in agreement. [Gu Weijun] kept looking out the window from time to time, not speaking, and seemed to be thinking about something as he withdrew his gaze. He sighed lightly, looking very stressed, but his night-time cultivation had enabled him to develop a habit of remaining calm even when Mount Tai collapses in front of him.
0:1:50|0:2:3|The carriage traveled for a long time, from dawn to dusk, with no lights on the side of the road, surrounded by darkness, only the moonlight evenly shining down, barely illuminating the road surface. Nevertheless, [Gu Weijun] did not stop, he continued to drive the horse without stopping.
0:2:3|0:2:22|The carriage passed through the neatly laid out tiles, after a night of bumps, it has arrived at the Saint Star Cathedral, soon to reach the Palace of Versailles. The sun was slowly rising at this moment, with a faint morning light shining on the cathedral, creating a unique charm, but [Gu Weijun] had no time to appreciate it, his expression serious, his eyes slightly swollen.
0:2:23|0:2:25|After the end of World War I, China, as one of the victorious countries, participated in the Paris Peace Conference.
0:3:19|0:3:30|The carriage continued to gallop wildly, [Gu Weijun] knew the importance of this meeting well, whether the current situation of China being at the mercy of others could be changed, whether its international status could be improved, all were closely related to this meeting.
0:3:30|0:3:41|On the street, a group of French refugees were walking expressionlessly. Among the crowd, few were in good health - some were using crutches, some were wrapped in bandages, and some had even lost their legs, looking disheveled.
0:3:41|0:4:0|War had just ended not long ago, and the social order was chaotic. Homeless people could be seen everywhere on the streets. The roads were narrow, and when carriages passed by, they had to stick close to the walls to avoid being hit. The carriage continued forward, reaching an even narrower road where refugees happened to be passing through. A large group of people completely blocked the road, creating a chaotic scene.
0:4:0|0:4:15|Both teams are in a dilemma. [Gu Weijun] intends to give way to them, but the space does not allow it. He looks outside and sees these people with sinister expressions, glaring angrily as if they want to devour him alive. After a brief standoff, the refugees become even more angry when they see the other side not moving.
0:4:15|0:4:24|They brandished their canes, flexing their muscles and preparing to step forward to give him a good beating. [Gu Weijun] saw the situation was turning bad and wanted to leave, but he was stuck in the middle and unable to act.
0:4:25|0:4:41|While [Gu Weijun] was considering how to respond, the refugees had already launched an attack. They smashed the car windows with a crutch, someone climbed onto the roof and pounded the roof with force, someone strangled the coachman's neck without letting go, and they were very ruthless. Like a pack of mad dogs, they crazily tore and bit at the carriage.
0:4:41|0:4:52|[Gu Weijun] could only use his arms to block the attacks and barely dodge them. Meanwhile, at the Paris hotel where the Chinese delegation was staying, the secretary hurried downstairs to inform the representatives in their rooms about the relevant matters.
0:5:5|0:5:20|Wang Zhengting smiled knowingly. At 8 o'clock in the morning, the five-colored flag slowly rose above the hotel accompanied by the national anthem of the Republic of China. The dance troupe representing the delegation was dressed in traditional Chinese Han clothing, standing tall and spirited. Many people gathered outside the hotel to participate in this flag-raising ceremony.
0:5:49|0:6:0|As soon as the words fell, the sound of horse hooves could be heard. [Gu Weijun] rode a carriage and hurried over. Everyone stretched their necks to look at him, with a look of watching a show on their faces, their eyes showing curiosity.
0:6:0|0:6:9|The original coachman was injured and replaced with a new one. The carriage looked intact, with only some broken glass. Looking through the glass, [Gu Weijun] appeared haggard and extremely disheveled.
0:6:10|0:6:28|The once exquisite clothes hung on him like rags, the bow tie had come undone and was limp around his neck. [Gu Weijun] was dozing off in the carriage, but abruptly woke up when the carriage stopped, pushing the door open and getting out. Despite his disheveled appearance, the wisdom in his eyes made people unconsciously overlook his attire.
0:6:28|0:6:33|Mei's companions were all shocked to see his appearance. [Gu Weijun] glanced around and quickly caught up with them.
0:6:35|0:6:52|In a palace, the French Prime Minister and President of the Paris Peace Conference, Clemenceau, is meeting with his subordinates. He is loudly cursing the American President Wilson, his actions becoming more violent. He is dissatisfied with the various treaties proposed by the United States, abolishing secret diplomacy, neither ceding territory nor paying reparations, which he finds extremely absurd.
0:6:52|0:7:9|Klimtson wanted to make a big profit from this meeting, squeezing out everything he could. Then, he squeezed them dry like squeezing orange juice. When he spoke, his eyes were sharp and full of ambition. Alec smiled slyly, fully agreeing with his idea. [Klimtson Mengsu] then burst into laughter.
0:7:9|0:7:33|Not long after, [Lu Zhengxiang] and [Gu Weijun] arrived here, both dressed in exquisite suits. After being questioned by the secretary, they were allowed to go to the second floor to meet with [Clémenceau]. The Chinese delegation hopes to regain Shandong from Germany, abolish the 21 Demands, and cancel the privileges of foreigners in China through the Paris Peace Conference.
0:7:33|0:7:47|Unfortunately, just a few days before the conference, we received notice that China, originally allocated five seats, was only given two.
0:7:48|0:7:56|[Kyle Mengso] saw them coming in and warmly greeted [Lu Zhengxiang]. [Lu Zhengxiang] shook hands with him with a smile on his face and introduced [Gu Weijun] to him.
0:7:56|0:8:11|The class ended, [Clay Montsau] began to show his true colors. He first mentioned his headache over Asian affairs, then brought up the fact that North Koreans had been waiting downstairs, which put him in a difficult position. [Lu Zhengxiang] and the others sensed the hidden meaning behind his words.
0:8:11|0:8:20|[Gu Weijun]’s face darkened, at this moment [Kerry Mengsu] invited them to sit down, but [Gu Weijun] walked up to him, with a mocking yet very polite retort.
0:8:27|0:8:37|[Kyle Monsour] slowly regained consciousness, his face showing a hint of confusion. He bluntly accused [Gu Weijun] of being too arrogant, and then ordered them to wait in the living room, arrogantly puffing on a cigar as he got up and left.
0:8:37|0:8:48|[Lu Zhengxiang] glanced at [Gu Weijun], with a look of disappointment on his face. At that moment, his men approached and escorted them out of the living room. [Eric] on the other hand, leisurely started whistling.
0:8:48|0:9:2|It was already three o'clock in the afternoon. Three alarm clocks in the living room rang simultaneously to mark the time. [Gu Weijun] paced back and forth in the room, while [Lu Zhengxiang] remained calm, leaning back in his chair and polishing his cane. He occasionally glanced at [Gu Weijun], and seeing him so anxious and restless, he called out to him.
0:10:45|0:10:52|The two had a disagreement, [Lu Zhengxiang] angrily got up and left. Meanwhile, [Xiao Kejian] was smugly fixing his appearance.
0:10:56|0:11:1|[Mei] walked past him and played the tune again, [Xiao Kejian] smiled even more.
0:11:2|0:11:15|After a long time, [Gu Weijun] was bored and started drawing. He drew a tiger with [Xiao Kejian]'s face, capturing his beard and pimpled eyes perfectly. Even the tiger's posture resembled [Xiao Kejian], with a short neck and a big belly.
0:11:15|0:11:28|[Gu Weijun] wrote quickly, with a look of disdain on his face. [Lu Zhengxiang] strolled in front of the bookcase behind him and couldn't help but laugh when he saw his painting. During the war, [Xiao Kejian] had a nickname, which was Tiger.
0:11:35|0:11:42|As soon as the words fell, [Xiao Kejian] led a large group of people to walk over in a disorderly manner. This time they were all dressed neatly, unlike the casualness just now.
0:11:52|0:11:59|[Xiao Kejian] picked up the painting on the table and glanced at it, then walked towards the desk. After shaking hands with [Lu Zhengxiang], the others also took their seats.
0:12:4|0:12:24|[Lv Zhengxiang] recounted the issue eloquently, stating that during the war, the French and British governments promised China that if it joined the war, it would be treated as a major power after the war and receive five seats at the conference. However, they were now informed that there were only two seats. [Lv Zhengxiang] narrated calmly, but his tone revealed a strong sense of oppression. [Kerry Mengsong] furrowed his brow.
0:12:24|0:12:32|After [Lu Zhengxiang] finished speaking, he paused for a moment before slowly speaking, shifting the blame to Japan, whose attitude towards China's position was very tough.
0:12:45|0:12:53|[Gu Weijun] took out the relevant documents from the file bag and handed them to [Clay Montsoreau]. [Clay Montsoreau] quickly scanned through them, snorted, and thought to himself.
0:12:57|0:13:8|He then changed the subject and asked why [Gu Weijun] had been standing all this time, urging him to sit down. [Clay Monger] asked in confusion. [Gu Weijun] spoke firmly.
0:13:11|0:13:22|[Erik] heard this and turned to look at [Chris Mengso], an official who was already so nervous that he stood up slightly. Seeing [Gu Weijun] being so stubborn, [Chris Mengso] decided to speak frankly to him. In his view.
0:13:34|0:13:41|During the conversation, [Chris Mengeso] picked up the tiger comic again, stood in front of [Gu Weijun], and looked at him with a mischievous childlike gaze.
0:13:42|0:13:45|[Gu Weijun] first agreed with [Clement So]'s statement.
0:13:52|0:13:56|[Klimonso] did not answer him, but instead smiled, with a hint of approval in his eyes.
0:13:57|0:14:10|President Wilson always mentions [Gu Weijun] and speaks highly of him. [Clemenceau] believes that young people like [Gu Weijun] are the future. He then turns his head and asks for [Lu Zhengxiang]'s opinion, to which [Lu Zhengxiang] gives a positive answer.
0:14:22|0:14:25|[Klimt] continues to change the subject and returns to his desk.
0:14:31|0:14:48|He took out an album from the drawer, which contained many other comics. He took them out one by one and showed them to [Gu Weijun]. In the comics, sometimes he was playing baseball, sometimes eating, and sometimes taking a walk with Ellie. Apart from these daily activities, there were also some big-headed simple sketches, a variety of everything.
0:14:53|0:15:9|[Gu Weijun] did not refuse. He took the tiger comic, signed his name and date in the lower right corner, and gave the comic to [Clemence]. Coming out of the conference hall, it was already late at night. [Gu Weijun] got on a horse and headed straight to the train station, where many people were gathered, all busy moving luggage.
0:15:9|0:15:15|After the carriage came to a slow stop, [Gu Weijun] leisurely stepped down. At that moment, a streetwalker enthusiastically threw herself onto him.
0:15:16|0:15:31|The female soldier was heavily made up, wearing a black long skirt on the lower body, and a tight-fitting top that highlighted her voluptuous figure. She linked arms with [Gu Weijun], trying to sell herself to him. [Gu Weijun] politely declined, but she persisted, following him all the way to the lobby.
0:15:32|0:15:42|There are many streetwalkers here, who are so desperate to attract clients that they resort to snatching handbags directly from others. When they see [Gu Weijun] entering, they swarm around him. [Gu Weijun] ignores them and continues walking forward.
0:15:49|0:16:2|[Gu Weijun] looked slightly dazed, glanced at him sideways, and then left. At this moment, [Mei], the wife of [Xiao Kejian], carried a suitcase and followed the crowd. She put down the luggage and looked around, while [Gu Weijun] was also searching for her in the crowd.
0:16:2|0:16:15|The crowd gradually dispersed, and the two finally saw each other. [Mei] wanted to pick up her luggage and go to him, but the suitcase was too heavy for her to lift at once. [Xiao Kejian] quickly ran up to her, shook hands and greeted her, then hurriedly picked up the luggage.
0:16:22|0:16:37|[Gu Weijun] supported [Mei] and escorted her home. Inside the room, he lit the fireplace and sat down to tend the fire. [Mei] leaned against the bed, looking at him with a worried expression. Seeing his demeanor, [Gu Weijun] let out a long sigh, then turned to gaze at the fire. [Mei] continued to inquire about [Xiao Kejian]'s condition.
0:16:56|0:17:3|Mei's eyes were full of shock, disbelief written all over her face, tears swirling in her eyes. Soon she snapped out of it.
0:20:0|0:20:9|[Lu Zhengxiang] thought for a moment and found the statement reasonable. He looked up and exchanged a glance with [Gu Weijun]. Meanwhile, [George] was pouring things out of a paper bag.
0:20:12|0:20:18|He repeatedly examined the jade in front of his eyes, his expression almost obsessed. He was so surprised that he couldn't speak.
0:20:24|0:20:29|After asking, he admired the jade again.
0:20:32|0:20:39|[Xiao Kejian] looked into his eyes, repeated it again, seeing that he didn't understand, so he explained the meaning of Kirin to him in French.
0:20:44|0:20:48|He held the jade in his hand, playing with it repeatedly, his eyes full of incredulity.
0:20:49|0:21:5|After a long time, he finally recovered from his astonishment, put the qilin into a paper bag, carefully sealed it, and then handed it back to [Xiao Kejian] with a look of admiration. [Xiao Kejian] nodded and took it, his actions full of resentment. He grabbed the paper bag, left the mouth open, and completely ignored the hand of the jade clan hovering in mid-air.
0:21:5|0:21:16|He took out things one by one, stuffed them into the pockets of his vest, while Mei slowly pounded the jade, watching him tidy up quietly, his eyes busy following his movements. Finally, [Xiao Kejian] picked up the qilin, hesitated for a moment, and put it around his neck.
0:21:17|0:21:23|He rubbed the qilin on his neck, with a touch of deep affection. Xiao Kejian lifted him up and added a word to [Mei].
0:21:24|0:21:42|When he said this, he had a sweet smile on his face, full of pride, but quickly turned serious again. Xiao Kejian turned around, opened the door and walked out. He stood at the doorway, took a deep breath, with a look of disgust in his eyes. He glanced around, determined the direction, and quickly walked out. He draped his clothes over his shoulders, and tore another piece, spinning it in the air.
0:21:42|0:21:56|[Xiao Kejian] bounced all the way, with brisk steps, even jumping onto someone else's bench. Coming down from it, she quickly ran out of here. [Gu Weijun] had just finished work and returned home at this time. As he hung up his hat and was about to go upstairs, he heard an argument coming from the kitchen.
0:22:0|0:22:6|Rao Na retorted him, as he tore the bread into small pieces and threw them into the bowl, with a look of disdain on his face.
0:22:11|0:22:24|Rao Na stabbed her mother from the stool, slapped her daughter's face, and the action shocked even herself. Rao Na coldly stared at her mother, walked out of the kitchen, and [Gu Weijun] happened to walk by. The two looked at each other for a moment. He paused.
0:22:27|0:22:41|The girl nodded, [Gu Weijun] said thank you, turned and left, leaving her head down. She then glanced at her mother, and left proudly. Her mother rubbed her hands, full of regret, sat down on a stool, looking self-reproachful, tears swirling in her eyes.
0:22:41|0:22:55|Upstairs, [Gu Weijun] sat at the table, covered with open files. He propped his head with his hand, looking troubled. At this moment, Letna's mother walked in with coffee and snacks, and [Gu Weijun] quickly stood up to thank her. Just as he was about to leave, [Gu Weijun] called out to him and whispered.
0:23:3|0:23:19|[Gu Weijun] had a sincere expression and caring words, but Nai's mother's expression turned serious. She walked towards [Gu Weijun], staring at him intently. Seeing her confusion, [Gu Weijun] heard the woman angrily saying she couldn't accept such charity and demanded an apology from [Gu Weijun].
0:23:20|0:23:32|Only to see him with a fierce look, as if there were flames burning in his eyes. [Gu Weijun] found it unbelievable to hear this, he put down the newspaper, took off his glasses, and looked at [Rang Na]'s mother in a searching way, his eyes full of doubt and confusion.
0:23:33|0:23:48|At this moment, [Mei] strode into the study with great momentum, glared at her mother, and went straight to the snacks. She took all the food from the tray and deliberately ate it in front of her mother. The mother was furious and stormed out in anger, while [Mei] remained indifferent.
0:23:48|0:23:55|She casually threw the snacks on the sofa, but soon started to breathe heavily. [Gu Weijun] hesitated to speak, and she then let out a long sigh.
0:24:1|0:24:16|[Rang Na] heard this and cried even louder. [Gu Weijun] helplessly put on his glasses to prepare for work, but was startled by the loud crying. In the end, [Gu Weijun] decided to go and comfort [Rang Na]. He propped up his body and slowly walked towards him, carefully calling out to him.
0:24:23|0:24:26|[Gu Weijun] ultimately chose to apologize, he said to [Rang Na].
0:24:28|0:24:44|[Ren Na]'s emotions became even more shattered, he cried out loudly, he even wanted to curse this war. In his eyes, [Gu Weijun] stepped forward again, explaining that he really wanted to help them. He looked at [Ren Na] with great sincerity, his eyes full of care.
0:24:44|0:25:1|Letting Na was moved by Gu Weijun's kindness and eventually forgave him. The girl sobbed on his shoulder, and Gu Weijun remained still, allowing Letting Na to release her emotions. Xiao Kejian went straight home after leaving the police station, and at this moment, he was squatting on the ground sorting out the luggage brought by his wife.
0:25:1|0:25:12|In the photo, there are two people, the latest newspapers, and a new Youth magazine, with two large boxes full of explanatory books. [Xiao Kejian] is ecstatic, excitedly flipping through these materials, with a gleam in his eyes.
0:25:13|0:25:19|[Mei] quietly sat by the bed, looking at her husband with gentle and contented eyes.
0:25:31|0:25:37|Xiao Kejian picked up a stack of newspapers and started reading. Mei couldn't help but smile when she saw how engrossed he was.
0:26:1|0:26:9|Mei didn't say anything. She got up and walked to her husband's side, covering him with a shawl. Xiao Kejian saw a photo in the stack of books, his eyes lighting up again.
0:26:28|0:26:35|[Xiao Kejian] quickly flipped to the back to look, her eyes shining brightly, she exclaimed.
0:26:42|0:26:57|Xiao Kejian choked up for a moment, then sighed deeply after a long time. The two fathers continued to bow their heads and look at the photos. Xiao Kejian took off the shawl covering Mei's body, full of heartache in his eyes.
0:27:9|0:27:19|Mei looked at her husband, Xiao Kejian embraced him, the two hugged each other, expressing their love through actions, Mei in his arms, with a sweet and beautiful smile.
0:27:19|0:27:29|At noon on the second day, the Chinese delegation was waiting for lunch at the table. Two waiters placed plates in front of each person and then left. The lunch consisted of foie gras and a glass of fruit juice.
0:27:29|0:27:48|The foie gras, although large, is of poor quality, the orange color doesn't look fresh, and the chef fried it too long, making it very difficult for everyone to cut. At this moment, Secretary Ye walked to the side of [Lu Zhengxiang], opened the file in his hand to show [Lu Zhengxiang], and then reported the situation to him.
0:27:59|0:28:5|[Lv Zhengxiang] went to look at the clock, it was already 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
0:28:37|0:28:53|After speaking, [Lu Zhengxiang] wiped his mouth and got up to leave, everyone could do nothing but watch him go. Shi Zhaoji then put down his utensils, pulled off the napkin expressionlessly, and walked out of the restaurant, followed closely by Wei Chenzu. At that moment, the vast restaurant was left with only [Gu Weijun] and Wang Zhengting.
0:28:53|0:29:5|[Gu Weijun] calmly eats his meal, unaffected by these few people. Wang Zhengting, on the other hand, watches them with a cold smile, then snorts. He conceals his temper towards these people, smiling as he stands up and looks towards [Gu Weijun].
0:29:28|0:29:44|The poet is getting ready for the meeting. People are entering the meeting room one after another. [Gu Weijun] is dressed in a suit and looks very eye-catching in the crowd. At this moment, a person takes out a pocket watch to check the time, accidentally drops it on the ground while putting it back in the pocket, but the person proudly doesn't notice that the watch has been picked up by someone else.
0:29:45|0:29:55|In the venue, Chris Mengso is sitting in the middle of the stage, with the other members sitting on either side of him. He lightly taps a gavel to get everyone's attention, and then he speaks, inviting the Japanese representative, Mino Fukami.
0:30:1|0:30:17|Mei and Xiao Kejian nodded to each other, then got up and walked towards the stage. As they passed by the presidium, Mei bowed to Xiao Kejian before finally standing in position. He calmly opened his speech notes, reached into his pocket to search for something, but found it empty, failing to find what he was looking for.
0:30:18|0:30:32|Mei's expression changed drastically as she quickly opened her clothes to search, but found nothing on both sides. She disregarded her image and frantically searched on her body, looking anxious, but still couldn't find it. By this time, everyone was getting impatient and whispering below.
0:30:36|0:30:46|Recalling where things were lost, [Xiao Kejian] was getting impatient. He knocked on the consciousness bell heavily to remind him to speak up quickly. Only then did [Lu Zhengxiang] stop and slowly began to speak.
0:30:46|0:30:56|Regarding the Shandong issue, the Japanese government and the Chinese government have already signed 21 articles, so there is no need to discuss it during this visit. He appeared arrogant and self-righteous, speaking without any sense of guilt.
0:30:58|0:31:6|[Lv Zhengxiang] spoke, his eyes constantly scanning the faces of everyone, as if trying to strengthen the credibility of his argument. [Xiao Kejian] then questioned him.
0:31:9|0:31:13|[Lv Zhengxiang] shook his head to deny his own words. He continued,
0:31:28|0:31:43|[Gu Weijun] sat in the audience with a furrowed brow, [Wang Zhengting] also looked furious, they stared straight at [Mu Yeshenxian], their eyes filled with cold light. On the other hand, [Mu Yeshenxian] appeared extremely arrogant, with his mouth stretched to his ears, his eyes showing contempt and provocation towards China.
0:31:43|0:31:49|Former Japanese Prime Minister Nishikuni Yoko Wang even expressed his admiration for him, his eyes full of approval for his words.
0:31:51|0:32:8|Mu Yeshen finished speaking, bowed to Klimt again, and then pretended to walk off the stage. Klimt announced the invitation for the Chinese representative to speak. [Gu Weijun] strode confidently to the lectern in a long and wide gown. As he stood tall and straight, the interpreter stood beside him.
0:32:8|0:32:12|[Gu Weijun] placed the speech manuscript on the table, his eyes scanning the room, exuding a sense of urgency and intimidation.
0:32:41|0:32:44|Mu Yeshen slammed the table and shouted.
0:32:49|0:32:56|In addition, he also cursed [Gu Weijun] as extremely shameless. Mu Yeshenxian's expression was fierce, like an angry monster.
0:32:57|0:33:8|The crowd around all started to giggle, even the people on the podium were smiling without saying a word. Inside the venue, everyone was whispering about this incident for a while, and Xiao Kejian lightly tapped a hammer to make everyone quiet.
0:33:54|0:34:7|Speak, [Gu Weijun] said lightly, looking at the dangerous pasture with a judgmental gaze. As soon as these words were spoken, everyone exchanged opinions. At this moment, British Prime Minister Lloyd George quietly said to Wilson, "[Gu Weijun] is a wise mouse." Wilson agreed.
0:34:40|0:34:51|[Gou Weijun]'s gaze was firm, and applause began to ring out in the room. More and more people were clapping, and the applause grew more enthusiastic. Loach [George] greatly appreciated that [Gou Weijun] was a true Chinese person who had cut off his queue.
0:34:58|0:35:1|Both of them looked at [Gu Weijun] with affirmation and appreciation in their eyes.
0:36:44|0:36:55|Wilson took the lead in standing up, with a smile on his face and an excited expression. Clermont applauded him as well, with a look of expectation on her face. They stood up and walked towards Gu Weijun, surrounding him and shaking hands with him in salute.
0:36:59|0:37:5|After the meeting, a large group of reporters waited to interview [Gu Weijun], but he only suggested that the reporter friends go to the Hua Gong Cemetery to take a look.
0:37:9|0:37:21|The next day, [Gu Weijun] rode a carriage back home. It was a beautiful estate with lush greenery, full of vitality. The carriage stopped in the courtyard, and [Gu Weijun] got off the carriage, allowing someone to run over to greet him.
0:37:24|0:37:40|[Gu Weijun] bid farewell to her politely and ran into the room with a smile on her face, full of spirit. Nana watched [Gu Weijun] enter the room with a smile on her lips, a gentle expression on her face, until she couldn't see her anymore. Nana remained in place, her eyes full of love for [Gu Weijun], revealing her girlish thoughts without reservation.
0:37:41|0:37:55|In the room, [Gu Weijun] picked up the letter on the table and opened it. There were no words on the letter, but two whimsical drawings. In the drawings, a pig was anthropomorphized, wearing a top hat and a suit, gently greeting two children, who were also eager to hug him.
0:37:55|0:38:7|Another painting shows three little pigs, with the big pig leading the way and the two little pigs following closely behind, happily strolling through the grass. [Gu Weijun] smiles gently, placing the painting carefully into the bookcase.
0:38:8|0:38:13|Seeing Nana walk in with the coffee, Mei couldn't help but sigh at how happy he looked, the first time she had ever seen him so cheerful.
0:38:16|0:38:20|Let Na hand the coffee to [Gu Weijun], then playfully snatch the painting and look at it.
0:38:31|0:38:41|Speaking in a gentle and patient manner, Mei made Na couldn't help but sigh. Xiao Kejian was walking around the room with a cup of coffee, while Na stood quietly watching him.
0:38:45|0:38:49|Nana heard that [Gu Weijun] had just lost his wife before coming to France.
0:39:1|0:39:3|Have [Mei] walk excitedly to the table immediately.
0:39:14|0:39:19|Let [Mei] walk away disappointed, [Xiao Kejian] picked up the letter and read it again in silence for a while.
0:39:25|0:39:28|After speaking, without waiting for [Gu Weijun] to react, he happily ran out of the room.
0:39:29|0:39:46|[Gu Weijun] heard this with a pensive expression, slightly stunned, put down the words, took off his glasses, and walked quickly to the door. He stood here looking out, only to see [Na] standing on the stairs, holding hands and smiling shyly. He reluctantly walked up step by step, his eyes always looking in the direction of [Gu Weijun].
0:39:46|0:39:49|But the smile on the girl's face didn't last long and gradually disappeared.
0:39:50|0:40:6|Somehow, [Mei] looked consistent, her expression becoming helpless and dejected, the corners of her mouth that had just turned up now drooping down. She hung her head in despair, completely different from before, her expression growing increasingly sad as she placed her hand on the armrest and slowly slumped down.
0:40:6|0:40:13|In the living room, [Mei]'s mother sat upright on the sofa, reading a book. She occasionally picked up her glasses and carefully read the contents of the book.
0:40:17|0:40:25|Mei beckoned, and [Nina] answered, walking in from outside. Seeing her daughter approaching, Mei's mother set down her book and looked at her with great seriousness.
0:40:30|0:40:34|Make the mother glare angrily from a distance, looking very angry, and then give a disdainful smile.
0:40:45|0:40:58|He turned and walked away, leaving the mother unable to argue. He picked up the book to read, but her gaze was fixed on her daughter, her eyes filled with a mix of worry and anger. She sighed heavily, dejectedly setting down the book, furrowing her brow.
0:41:27|0:41:31|After exchanging pleasantries, the two sat down. [Gu Weijun] looked at the various tableware on the side.
0:41:38|0:41:49|[Gu Weijun] cast a look of doubt. Wei Lianshi followed closely. [Gu Weijun] pondered for a moment, then Wei Lianshi continued.
0:41:53|0:41:57|After speaking, he looked towards the door and saw [Lu Zhengxiang] swaggering in from outside.
0:42:6|0:42:10|He came and felt honored, then sat down across from [Gu Weijun].
0:42:31|0:42:41|William felt a little guilty. He didn't say anything, just smiled awkwardly, picked up his glass and took a sip of wine. Mu also felt the tension, just as he put down his glass. He paused for a moment, organized his thoughts, and slowly began to speak.
0:42:54|0:43:2|[Mei] is also deeply involved, looking serious. This is in stark contrast to the arrogant and rude expression she had at the cannibal feast that day, yet one can still detect a hint of calculation in her eyes.
0:43:12|0:43:20|William looked relaxed, showing a considerate attitude towards China. [Gu Weijun] stared at William with a serious expression.
0:43:21|0:43:33|The waiter brought the steak and French baked scallops to the table. [Gu Weijun] picked up his knife and fork, ready to enjoy the meal, while calmly starting to argue back. He made a metaphor, describing the situation as a police officer finding a wallet.
0:43:38|0:43:41|[Gu Weijun] raised his eyes and looked at the two of them with a playful expression.
0:43:42|0:43:55|Wei Lianshi's face showed some hesitation, wanting to retort but feeling guilty inside. His eyes were sunken, his beard trembling with anger, and his eyebrows furrowed. [Gu Weijun] ignored the two of them, casually took a sip of wine, and began to taste the scallops.
0:43:55|0:44:10|He picked up a piece of scallop meat from the white sauce and cheese and put it into his mouth. Seeing his scheme exposed, [Mei] racked his brains for a new excuse. Seeing him so calm, still able to eat without distraction, [Xiao Kejian] couldn't help but retort in frustration.
0:44:14|0:44:21|[Gu Weijun] seemed to ignore his words, continuing to eat in his own way. [Mu Yeshenxian] became increasingly angry, his expression gradually turning fierce.
0:44:23|0:44:30|[Gu Weijun] looked dislocated, he finished the last sip of wine, smiled and thanked, then got up and left.
0:44:47|0:44:50|At the same time, the Beijing government also sent an urgent training notice to [Lu Zhengxiang].
0:44:58|0:45:13|The Japanese government has lodged a protest with Beijing, accusing the Chinese government of violating the mutually agreed upon agreement at the association and demanding the replacement of [Gu Weijun]'s representative status.
0:45:47|0:46:3|[Xiao Kejian]'s words made the other three present fall silent. He handed the documents to [Wang Zhengting], who looked through them with a more serious expression. Then he passed the documents to [Shi Zhaoji], whose expression relaxed slightly after reading them.
0:46:53|0:46:56|[Lv Zhengxiang] spoke with a resolute tone and a determined gaze.
0:46:57|0:47:14|[Gu Weijun] pushed the door open with a file in hand, only to find everyone gathered inside. He was at a loss for words for a moment. The three of them awkwardly smiled, got up and walked out. [Gu Weijun] leaned against the wall, feeling a bit lost. After seeing them off, he quickly handed the file to [Lu Zhengxiang].
0:47:17|0:47:21|Mrs. Pei De Beifei, wife of [Lu Zhengxiang], walked out of the bedroom with a smile as beautiful as a night flower.
0:47:27|0:47:32|She helped her husband sit on the sofa, with [Lu Zhengxiang] maintaining a serious expression on his face, which was now filled with a smile.
0:47:44|0:47:46|[Lu Zhengxiang] lightly patted his wife, trying to calm her down.
0:47:53|0:48:0|He continued. [Lu Zhengxiang] nodded heavily, agreeing with that.
0:48:4|0:48:26|Say it, the two walked out together. On the other side, [Mei] just woke up from her sleep, she turned over and found [Xiao Kejian] was not there, so she got up to look for him. At this moment, [Xiao Kejian] was sorting out documents by the window, showing deep affection and seriousness. Seeing his wife waking up, a smile bloomed on his face, and [Mei] unexpectedly looked gentle.
0:48:26|0:48:30|After speaking, she continued with her actions, and [Mei] gave a playful smile.
0:48:35|0:48:51|[Mei] put on her clothes and walked into the room with a smile. She moved a chair and stood on it, reaching for the food on top of the wardrobe. She took down a can of coffee, and as she was about to get the bread, she felt something strange in a paper bag. She paused, quickly took it down and opened it, only to find a handgun inside.
0:48:51|0:49:9|[Mei] took out the gun and checked it repeatedly, her breathing becoming rapid, her eyes filled with fear. She tightly gripped the gun, trembling, and got off the chair in a panic. She walked quickly towards [Xiao Kejian], but as she neared the door, her steps slowed down. After hesitating for a moment, [Mei] still walked over and leaned against the door, not saying a word.
0:49:9|0:49:20|[Xiao Kejian] heard his wife approaching, his movements paused, a hint of guilt on his face as he slowly looked up at her. He saw [Mei] holding a gun, her face full of fear, hair disheveled, eyes filled with panic.
0:49:20|0:49:35|[Xiao Kejian] knew that he had been discovered, so he lowered his head and remained silent. [Mei] trembled all over, her breathing unsteady, her large eyes filled with disbelief. [Xiao Kejian] dared not look directly at him, his eyes shifting and avoiding contact. [Mei] tried to control her emotions and spoke up to ask.
0:49:47|0:49:54|[Xiao Kejian] avoided eye contact, not saying a word for a long time. She walked slowly towards her wife and took the gun from her.
0:49:57|0:50:3|[Mei], feeling relieved all of a sudden, couldn't stop her tears from flowing. She hugged her husband tightly and cried out.
0:50:24|0:50:35|At the same time, an explosion occurred at the Japanese delegation's residence, with flames shooting out of the windows. The building was quickly filled with thick smoke, ambulances were urgently transporting the injured downstairs, and the fire brigade was busy extinguishing the fire.
0:50:35|0:50:44|Mu Yeshen and [The Four Lords of the West] were standing in a sorry state downstairs. Mu Yeshen nodded and bowed to report to [The Four Lords of the West], speculating that either the Koreans or the Chinese were behind this.
0:50:45|0:50:47|[The Four Lords of the Western Regions] gritted their teeth and said.
0:50:57|0:51:11|On February 20, 1912, several guns were quietly extended from the railing next to the Palace of Versailles. [Clyde Monso] walked out of the main gate with a smile on his face, completely unaware of the danger. Just as he was about to board the carriage, his gaze suddenly focused, as if he had noticed something unusual.
0:51:11|0:51:20|But it was too late, the sniper pulled the trigger, the bullet passed through [Chris Mengeso]'s right shoulder and arm, he was shot a total of six times, but none hit vital organs.
0:51:24|0:51:27|[Kyle Mengso] clutched his wound and fell to the ground in pain.
0:52:14|0:52:21|[Gu Weijun] ignored [Wang Zhengting]'s sarcastic remarks, opened the door and left. But then he stopped at the doorway, reminding with a smile that was not quite a smile.
0:52:26|0:52:33|[Gu Weijun] pushed the door shut with a bang, his smile disappearing instantly. He rode the carriage back to the manor, where someone had been waiting for him.
0:52:45|0:52:58|[Gu Weijun] strode towards the room, his face full of panic. He pushed open the door and headed upstairs. When he reached the middle of the stairs, he suddenly stopped, turned around, and called for the door to be locked. [Gu Weijun] then hurried to the room on the second floor.
0:53:1|0:53:13|In the room, [Xiao Kejian] is lying on the sofa. [Mei] has just finished applying medicine for him, wiping the sweat beads on his forehead with a towel, looking worried. [Gu Weijun] did not come in, he stood at the door peeking inside through the crack.
0:53:13|0:53:26|After a while, he closed the door and left from here. [Mei] heard the noise and quickly put down the towel to chase after him. [Gu Weijun] was furious, he stormed through the corridor with a dark expression on his face, [Mei] shouted after him from behind.
0:53:36|0:53:43|[Mei] was unable to speak for a moment and looked a bit aggrieved leaning against the door. Faced with [Gu Weijun]'s anger, she was also a little scared.
0:54:15|0:54:34|[Gu Weijun] turned and left, [Mei] looked on with a helpless expression as he went downstairs, then returned to the room. He closed the door, carefully walked over to [Xiao Kejian], and squatted down to take care of him. [Xiao Kejian] looked pale, his lips devoid of any color, his neck and arms wrapped in thick bandages, yet blood still seeped through.
0:54:34|0:54:44|He is resting with his eyes closed, dark circles under his eyes, showing signs of exhaustion. He adjusts his position slightly, but groans in pain. [Mei] leans in close to his ear and speaks to him.
0:54:48|0:55:4|The severe injury made [Xiao Kejian] sleep very restlessly. She started coughing violently, causing her wound to be pulled, and she winced in pain. [Lu Zhengxiang] comfortingly stroked her head, his eyes filled with unrelenting concern. She tried hard to suppress the sadness, but the series of events left her feeling helpless and heartbroken.
0:55:4|0:55:12|A few days later, [Xiao Kejian]'s injuries were gradually healing, but the wound on her arm was not healing well. At this moment, she was taking a walk in the estate with her wife and [Gu Weijun].
0:55:13|0:55:31|The lawn of the manor is as soft as a carpet, allowing Mei to search for mushrooms here with a basket in hand. She pulls the grass aside and sees two fresh mushrooms close together. She picks them and puts them in the basket, which is now full of her harvest for the day. She looks up and sees three people walking by, a slight smile playing on her lips.
0:55:41|0:55:58|In the distance, [Gu Weijun] had his hand on [Xiao Kejian]'s back. He was wearing a suit today, with his hair casually loose, a departure from his usual serious look. As they walked and talked, they would stop to discuss when they disagreed. Seeing such a lively side of [Gu Weijun], Nana's smile grew even wider.
0:55:58|0:56:0|Jenna smiled knowingly without [Mei] noticing.
0:56:10|0:56:25|[Mei] waved and greeted [Nana], bouncing over to her, while [Gu Weijun] and [Xiao Kejian] continued their walk. [Nana] still gazed affectionately at her beloved, as [Mei] walked over and squatted beside him, chatting with him. He looked at the basket full of mushrooms and couldn't help but sigh.
0:56:27|0:56:35|[Mei] didn't answer, saying she envied the three of them. The three of them were like siblings, and there was longing in his eyes.
0:56:36|0:56:40|They grew up together since childhood, which made [Nana] even more envious.
0:57:17|0:57:41|[Gu Weijun] turned his back in anger, and [Xiao Kejian] fell silent. After saying these words, [Gu Weijun] walked away, while [Xiao Kejian] stood there lost in thought. At that moment, [Liang Na] was asking [Mei] how to say "I love you" in Chinese.
0:57:56|0:58:2|Approaching [Xiao Kejian] and [Gu Weijun], Mei couldn't help but smile slightly when she heard the two of them chatting, and walked towards them.
0:58:13|0:58:22|In the Palace of Versailles, [Lu Zhengxiang] is pacing by the window, and Eric immediately reports that the assassin has been caught. [Lu Zhengxiang] hurriedly asks, but Eric says:
0:58:23|0:58:36|Kerry Mengso was furious and roared in confusion, not understanding why the assassin did this. The assassin did it for justice, sympathizing with China and all the small countries. Kerry Mengso became even angrier, waving his cane and shouting.
0:58:43|0:58:55|[Gu Weijun] walked into the hall with a bouquet of flowers at this moment, where he met Chris Manso. The two shook hands in a friendly manner, and Chris Manso took the flowers, inviting him to sit down.
0:58:55|0:59:8|Kerry Mengsuo recounted to [Gu Weijun] the information Eric had just reported, and admitted that if the news had come any later, he might have suspected it was [Gu Weijun]'s doing. [Gu Weijun] then jokingly laughed with him.
0:59:11|0:59:15|Kerry Meng gave a hearty laugh and once again thanked [Gu Weijun] for coming to visit him.
0:59:30|0:59:36|[Gu Weijun] smiled and said. But Klimt said.
0:59:43|0:59:53|Klimt said. But they had no choice. [Gu Weijun] reminded Klimt.
1:0:5|1:0:11|Klimt nodded without saying a word, then turned and walked to the chair to sit down, smiling as he admired [Gu Weijun], who was very good at debating.
1:0:12|1:0:23|Kerry Mengsoo then pointed out that the proposal of the President of the United States is very similar to his own proposal, asking if they had discussed it. [Gu Weijun] sat down on the sofa tent and, facing Kerry Mengsoo's question, he simply said.
1:0:27|1:0:33|[Gu Weijun]'s high emotional intelligence response made the admiration on Kremon's face even stronger.
1:0:54|1:1:4|[Gu Weijun] stood up, bowed slightly to Klimt, and then packed up to leave. Klimt gestured for Alec to see him off, [Gu Weijun] nodded slightly to him, and walked slowly out the door.
1:1:5|1:1:21|In the following meeting, the representatives of several countries were almost going crazy. [George] pointed at the map, arguing fiercely with [Clement]. Clement, a mere scholar, calmly listened to him. On the other hand, Wilson seemed completely detached, with a smile of amusement at this farce.
1:1:23|1:1:29|At the long table in the conference room, representatives from several countries had different expressions, but the greed was still evident in everyone's eyes.
1:1:29|1:1:44|Clement sits in the front row, looking relatively calm. Lohe [George] and a representative of a country stand arguing. Wilson watches intently, while Orlando bows his head in thought. Muye Shenxian and several other representatives from different countries argue more fiercely, all waving their hands to reject each other's opinions.
1:1:52|1:2:5|At the end of the meeting, Italy's ambition to dominate the Mediterranean was fiercely criticized by the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. The Italian delegation, seeing no benefits to be gained, angrily left the room and completely withdrew from the conference on April 24, 1919.
1:2:16|1:2:32|The leaders of England and France immediately supported Japan. President Wilson hesitated. After weighing the interests of the United States in Asia repeatedly, he finally sacrificed China and supported Japan.
1:2:57|1:3:6|Japan's attempt to annex Shandong at the Paris Peace Conference is about to succeed!
1:3:24|1:3:57|In the Palace of Versailles, [Clement Soames] and [George] are looking outwards. [Clement Soames] looks at the protesters in the distance and remarks that she has never noticed so many Chinese people in Paris. [George] takes out his pipe and tells [Clement Soames] that she will realize all the Chinese people in France are here, and when she returns to England, she will see how many Chinese people there are. [Clement Soames] jokes about the Chinese people welcoming her at the station. However, [George] says that out of the three of them, only the President will receive flowers from the Chinese people. They say this is for peace.
1:4:8|1:4:15|Kerry Mengso and Lohe [George] hid in the restaurant, picked up the wine on the table and continued chatting. They listened to the protests downstairs.
1:4:20|1:4:31|[Wilson] was originally watching by the window and overheard the conversation between the two. Downstairs, [Xiao Ke] was passionately giving a speech. Chinese compatriots were holding banners in active response.
1:5:14|1:5:28|In the hall, [Clint Mansu] sat on the sofa in the middle, with [George Wilson] as well as [Lu Zhengxiang] and [Gu Weijun] sitting on either side. [Clint Mansu] chaired the meeting, and he first invited [Wilson] to speak on behalf. [Wilson] spoke slowly.
1:5:55|1:6:8|The furrowed brow tightened, eyes flickering with uncontrollable anger, a serious expression. [Lu Zhengxiang] appeared calm on the surface, but he kept lightly tapping the ground with his cane, evidently just as conflicted inside. The two exchanged glances from time to time, sharing their thoughts.
1:6:8|1:6:13|Wilson read more and more quietly as he reached the end, with a depressed mood in his eyes. After finishing reading, he closed the file.
1:6:29|1:6:41|[Lv Zhengxiang] looked up at Wilson when he heard this, then lowered his eyes in contemplation for a long time. He tightly gripped his cane, let out a deep sigh, and replied that this plan would greatly disappoint the Chinese people. [Gu Weijun] then spoke up.
1:6:48|1:7:5|The hall fell silent, with no one speaking for a moment. [George], who had been smoking all along, broke the silence and asked [Lu Zhengxiang] and [Xiao Kejian] in a leisurely manner whether they preferred the solution proposed by the Chinese government and Japan, including the 21 demands, or the one just put forward by the American president.
1:7:5|1:7:21|[George] looked disdainful, holding a pipe in his mouth, leaning back on the sofa, arrogantly scanning the two of them. His tone carried a hint of threat, more like an interrogation than a question. After speaking, he took a deep drag on his cigarette and leaned back further. [Gu Weijun] expressed firmly.
1:7:40|1:7:44|Although Wilson sounded confident, [Gu Weijun] still looked doubtful in his eyes.
1:7:48|1:7:57|But in his view, when the time came, he blew a whistle, clearly indicating that [Gu Weijun] had long seen through the tricks of the United States.
1:8:5|1:8:14|[Gu Weijun] retorted, reminding the audience to be cautious. Wilson nodded, and Clemens and [George] gestured with their eyes for him to continue.
1:8:28|1:8:35|[Gu Weijun] paused for a moment, then continued to explain the consequences. By then, they could only regret it.
1:8:50|1:8:53|When the conversation didn't go well, [Lu Zhengxiang] stood up and left first, followed closely by [Gu Weijun].
1:8:54|1:9:12|Outside the Palace of Versailles, the French guards received orders to attack the Chinese protesters. They rode on horses, holding sticks, charging towards the crowd from all directions. Wooden signs were knocked to the ground and broken in half. The protesters fought back with whatever tools they had at hand, but the guards were well-equipped and unaffected.
1:9:12|1:9:22|They used batons and pepper spray to strike the crowd, being ruthless and targeting vital points. Despite this, no one retreated. In the crowd, someone tightly clung to Mei's legs, trying to pull the guard down.
1:9:23|1:9:36|Someone used a fragile wooden board as a shield, fiercely fighting back against the sticks. The efforts made by the Chinese people were like a bowl of chicken feed, with some being beaten until blood flowed, falling to the ground. But as one person fell, another person rushed forward, no one gave up.
1:9:36|1:9:48|The security guards were surrounded by a large crowd, they dared not get off the carriage, only using sticks to beat. But this was not enough to defeat the Chinese people, the scene was in chaos, signs with slogans scattered on the ground, trampled haphazardly by hooves.
1:9:49|1:9:58|But the determination to recapture Qingdao has deeply rooted in the hearts of the Chinese people. In the newspapers, the Shandong issue occupies the front page, and more and more people join the parade.
1:9:58|1:10:10|When the news of Germany transferring its interests in Shandong to Japan reached Beijing, the Chinese public was immediately plunged into a state of despair and anger.
1:10:13|1:10:24|On May 4th, the May Fourth Movement, an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movement, broke out in China. The domestic voices were getting louder and louder, posing a greater challenge to the delegation.
1:10:26|1:10:49|At night, [Lu Zhengxiang] paced in the room, and his assistant knocked on the door. [Lu Zhengxiang] looked at the letter with a serious expression, furrowing his brows. After reading it, he crumpled the letter into a ball and sighed heavily. However, [Gu Weijun] was not as excited as the other delegates, calmly flipping through the newspaper.
1:11:6|1:11:13|[Gu Weijun] suddenly looked up at the Wei Chen team, then calmly put away the newspaper and picked up the teacup.
1:11:44|1:11:59|The atmosphere in the room became tense for a moment. Just then, [Lu Zhengxiang] walked over and the others quickly stood up to greet him. After [Lu Zhengxiang] sat down, he waved his hand for everyone to sit down, and the four of them looked at him, waiting for him to speak. However, [Lu Zhengxiang] remained silent, making Wei Chenzu impatient.
1:12:17|1:12:21|[Gu Weijun] angrily pounded the table, while Wei Zhanzu helplessly leaned back.
1:12:31|1:12:38|[Gu Weijun] heard this and his face lit up with excitement. After some consideration, he made up his mind to discuss it with [Lu Zhengxiang].
1:12:44|1:12:46|Outside, lightning flashed and thunder roared. The next morning, Mei and Xiao Kejian took a car to the Palace of Versailles.
1:13:9|1:13:24|In order to change the unfavorable situation facing China, the delegation had to endure humiliation, negotiate with various parties, and make every effort to mediate diplomatically. Here, [Gu Weijun] glanced out the window with a heavy heart. [Lu Zhengxiang] was the same.
1:13:24|1:13:34|The plan to retain the signature may not be satisfactory, but it is currently the only way, and perhaps the last resort.
1:13:49|1:13:53|The foreign powers rejected all the requests of the Chinese delegation.
1:13:58|1:14:3|After our diplomatic efforts failed, [Lu Zhengxiang] completely lost faith.
1:14:33|1:14:39|[Gu Weijun] was slightly stunned, with a blazing fire of anger in his eyes, he slammed the phone heavily on the table.
1:15:1|1:15:7|In front of the table, Jesus is nailed to the cross by the dead son, symbolizing redemption, as [Lu Zhengxiang] slowly swallows facing him.
1:15:12|1:15:25|[Lu Zhengxiang] couldn't help but sob, [Gu Weijun] leaned helplessly against the door frame, his eyes full of sadness. At this moment, Pei Debofei pushed the door open and saw his husband crying in front of Jesus, feeling extremely heartbroken, and looked at [Gu Weijun] with a face full of anger.
1:15:25|1:15:32|[Gu Weijun] walked towards the inner room, followed by [Pei Debofei], who closed the door behind him. [Gu Weijun] stood in the room, the light in his eyes almost extinguished.
1:15:33|1:15:41|[Pei Debufei] walked up to [Gu Weijun], angrily growling at him, asking him not to blame [Lu Zhengxiang] too much for this matter.
1:15:45|1:15:55|[Gu Weijun] slowly turned around, leaving behind two lines of tears. He bowed deeply to [Pei Debufei], then left. [Pei Debufei]'s anger turned into shock.
1:15:56|1:16:9|He looked at the back of [Gu Weijun] in disbelief, it was already midnight, the sky outside was covered with dark clouds pressing low, moving quickly with the wind, casting a gloomy shadow over the whole of Paris.
1:16:9|1:16:20|[Gu Weijun] drove home, passing by the iconic buildings of France, the July Column and the Arc de Triomphe, but he couldn't appreciate them. The atmosphere became increasingly heavy, with a sense of oppressive darkness looming over the city.
1:16:21|1:16:37|The once shining sculpture now showed no beauty at all, raindrops quietly falling on the dim streetlights, making the scene even more desolate. [Gu Weijun] sat in the car with his eyes closed, resting as his body swayed with the car's movements. A flash of lightning and thunder woke him up, just as the car came to a stop.
1:16:37|1:16:51|[Gu Weijun] glanced out the window, gestured for the driver to keep going. There, [Xiao Kejian] stood with workers and students holding banners in front of his house. Even in such heavy rain, their spirits were high. When they saw [Gu Weijun] return, they raised their arms and cheered.
1:17:9|1:17:21|[Gu Weijun] sighed lightly, straightened his bow tie and prepared to get off the car. His gaze was firm, ready to face the crowd. [Xiao Kejian] jumped down from the steps and stood beside the car door. His face looked tired, but his eyes were bright. The two men looked at each other, [Xiao Kejian] with a very serious expression.
1:18:19|1:18:31|The crowd was enraged, [Gu Weijun] was surrounded by them, being scolded and insulted, [Mei]'s mother was alarmed, looking down in fear, [Mei] at this moment also covered her mouth in disbelief, her pupils dilated.
1:18:31|1:18:44|She turned and ran, picking up a gun and quickly descending the stairs without any hesitation. She ran to the edge of the crowd and fired a shot into the sky, instantly quieting the restless crowd. [Mei]'s mother was shocked to see this scene. Let Na continue to shout.
1:18:49|1:19:1|Whether it was the sincerity that moved the crowd or the gunshot that intimidated them, [Gu Weijun] finally managed to enter the room safely. He was soaked all over, with his hair falling messily over his forehead, looking extremely disheveled.
1:19:2|1:19:20|He refused to yield, obviously not recovering from the previous siege. [Gu Weijun] took off his coat, sat forcefully on the bed, stood with his hands on his hips, looking angry. He impatiently loosened his tie, swayed to the sofa chair and lay down. With his eyes closed, [Gu Weijun] looked exhausted and irritated on his face.
1:19:21|1:19:36|He was restless, constantly adjusting his position. Suddenly, he heard footsteps approaching. He abruptly opened his eyes and saw [Mei] walking towards him with coffee and snacks, looking concerned. She placed the tray on the table, sat next to [Gu Weijun], and held his hand to comfort him.
1:19:39|1:19:54|[Mei] was full of heartache. [Gu Weijun] sat up, feeling comforted by her words. A smile finally appeared on [Gu Weijun]'s face, and [Mei] also smiled slightly in response.
1:19:55|1:20:4|At this moment, Mei's mother came in from the door and said excitedly. Gu Weijun thanked her moved, Mei's mother said.
1:20:11|1:20:15|Let [Na] ran over and hugged her mother, and the mother and daughter finally reconciled at this moment.
1:20:16|1:20:29|It was another night, [Mei] walked down the stairs and headed towards the room at the end of the corridor. [Xiao Kejian] was having a meeting with a group of patriots here. He stood at the front, with a determined look, while the others sat below, listening attentively.
1:20:42|1:20:58|Suddenly, a loud thunderclap exploded in the sky, with lightning flashing on everyone's faces. Everyone seemed hesitant and silent. As they reached the doorway of the room and listened to their conversation, they remained silent, with [Xiao Kejian] making a brief statement.
1:21:11|1:21:26|Desperately closing her eyes, [Mei] quickly ran away from the room and boarded a carriage, galloping through the rainy night. The carriage drove out of the house, with [Mei] sitting on it in a state of anxiety. Meanwhile, the association had already prepared the slips for drawing lots.
1:21:26|1:21:37|[Xiao Kejian] took a card first, opened it to check the result. [Mei] kept looking out the window, sweat dripping from her forehead, praying to arrive quickly. The carriage finally arrived at the destination, the home of [Gu Weijun].
1:21:38|1:21:51|Mei got out of the car before it had even stopped, rushing towards the gate. He stumbled a few times, almost falling, and tried to push the iron gate open with no success as it was locked from the inside.
1:21:51|1:22:1|In his emotional state, [Mei] didn't climb up the steps to ring the bell. The heavy rain made it impossible for him to open his eyes for a moment. He shook the bell while peering through the crack in the door, hoping that the people inside could hear.
1:22:2|1:22:16|The loud bell woke up [Nina], she put on her clothes and ran downstairs. [Mei] continued to shake the bell, the frequency getting faster and her mood becoming more anxious. [Nina] quickly ran to the front door, [Mei] saw her coming and flew to the opposite side of her.
1:22:27|1:22:41|[Mei] quickly stopped him from saying no, and got back on the carriage again. [Nana] watched him leave, with a bewildered look on her face. Raindrops fell on the ground, creating splashes, as [Mei] sat in the carriage, her eyes closed tightly, tilting her lower lip up, pondering on what else could be done.
1:22:41|1:22:49|She looked out the window, her eyebrows furrowed and tears welling up in her eyes. At this moment, [Xiao Kejian] opened the note, on which there was only one word, "death".
1:22:50|1:23:8|He closed and opened the note again, but the situation was already set. Rain washed over the glass, making Jiang [Mei]'s figure blurry, but one could still see his despair that night. [Mei] leaned against the wall and ran to the meeting room in a hurry, but the lights were already out, the fire extinguished, and the house empty.
1:23:9|1:23:26|[Mei] looked around the empty room, feeling lost. Suddenly, she noticed scattered notes on the table and hurried over. Each note had fresh handwriting, including the one with the word "death" written on it. [Mei] felt a sense of unease and quickly ran back to the house she and [Xiao Kejian] had found, but the room remained silent and still.
1:23:26|1:23:32|She turned her head and saw a letter on the table. She quickly picked it up and read it. The letter only had four short lines, but [Mei] read it for a long time.
1:23:46|1:24:1|[Mei]'s large eyes were instantly filled with despair. She put down the letter, turned around and ran out, not feeling any pain even when her knees knocked against the table. She ran downstairs all the way to try to catch up with her husband, but there was no sign of him. [Mei] leaned against the wall in despair, her emotions on the verge of collapse.
1:24:4|1:24:14|He leaned weakly against the wall, tears mixed with rain falling down. Sitting on the steps, he cried uncontrollably, his eyes filled with helplessness.
1:24:14|1:24:27|The heavy rain continued, echoing his cries, but the violent shaking of his shoulders said it all. The tears had dried up, his hollow eyes like a stagnant pool, unable to produce any ripples. After a night of downpour, the rain finally stopped in the early morning.
1:24:54|1:25:6|At that time, she and [Mei] rode bicycles through the streets and alleys of Paris. [Mei] was wearing a long skirt and a vest, with a straw hat on her head and two braids. Xiao Kejian was wearing a shirt and also had a vest over her clothes.
1:25:6|1:25:14|The two characters are dressed in similar colors, with [Mei] and [Xiao Kejian] looking very compatible. Even the sunlight seems to favor them, shining warmly on the two of them.
1:25:15|1:25:32|Like a layer of golden light was cast upon them, Mei and Xiao Kejian chased each other along the banks of the Seine River, feeling incredibly happy. Memories came flooding back one by one, but the leading lady in each memory was Mei. Tired from cycling, the two simply lay down on the grass beneath the Eiffel Tower, facing each other with their eyes closed, quietly feeling the breeze and the sunlight.
1:25:32|1:25:41|The sun was warm that day, with fluffy white clouds in the sky, a rare good weather. All memories [Xiao Kejian] had about [Mei] were so vivid, indicating his deep reluctance to let go.
1:25:42|1:26:0|[Gu Weijun] immersed himself in the tranquility brought by playing the piano. With his eyes closed, his body swayed back and forth with the melody. In front of the smiling audience, he appeared surprisingly calm. Just learning that he had to attend this event, he was shocked and flustered, but at this moment he was extremely calm. As the sky gradually brightened, the music also reached its climax, and [Gu Weijun] became even more engrossed.
1:26:0|1:26:2|Behind him, the flames in the fireplace were roaring.
1:26:3|1:26:19|Versailles Palace gate has also been engulfed in raging flames, with the flames soaring into the sky. [Xiao Kejian] stands resolutely in the midst of it all. In the final moments of her life, sweet memories of smiles keep flashing through her mind, along with the unicorn she has always worn on her chest, symbolizing happiness. However, in the end, even the unicorn could not bring happiness to the two of them.
1:26:20|1:26:30|The raging fire illuminated [Xiao Kejian]'s face, tears that he had been holding back refused to fall, shining brightly under the light. Apart from reluctance, there was also a deep resentment towards the foreign powers on his face.
1:26:30|1:26:46|The decision is about to be made, and the flames are getting closer to [Xiao Kejian]. He remains motionless, as if he can't feel the pain, gradually being engulfed by the fire. In the end, [Xiao Kejian] uses this incomprehensible way to fulfill his patriotic ideals, as the blaze rushes towards the flags of the three countries.
1:26:46|1:26:58|In just a moment, everything here turned into ashes, with black smoke billowing and rising into the sky. The flames slowly subsided, but the sacrifice made by [Xiao Kejian] will surely leave a profound mark. With this protest action coming to an end.
1:26:59|1:27:15|[Mei] and [Gu Weijun] came to the Huagong Cemetery together, where a new tombstone appeared with the name of [Xiao Kejian] on it. This time, [Gu Weijun] could no longer argue with him. He lit a match and held it in his hand for a long time. When the matchstick was halfway burnt, he slowly lit the candle.
1:27:15|1:27:26|[Xiao Kejian]'s sacrifice made [Gu Weijun] momentarily unable to accept it. He silently looked at the tombstone, his expression filled with sorrow. [Mei] clasped her hands together, tears streaming down her cheeks, her eyes devoid of their usual sparkle.
1:27:27|1:27:45|The Huaguo Cemetery has attracted many people, and tonight it is brightly lit. On the eve of the conference closing, we received 86 telegrams from overseas Chinese communities and domestic public groups around the world, all urging the delegation to refuse to sign the Versailles Treaty.
1:27:46|1:27:59|In the blink of an eye, the time came to June 28, 1919. The gates of the Palace of Versailles opened once again, with carriages and cars entering one after another. Many people gathered in the hall, chatting in groups of two or three.
1:27:59|1:28:14|Someone is standing in the middle of the hall, someone is sitting at the table, everyone's face is expressionless, but whenever someone shakes hands with them, a fake smile appears. Everyone is in a weak position, with people coming and going, but around [Wang Zhengting] and [Gu Weijun], it is quiet and no one is chatting.
1:28:14|1:28:26|The two sat at the front of the long table, with [Wang Zhengting] gazing at the crowd in a trance, while [Gu Weijun] remained solemn and silent. [Very Wong] and other members of the presidium sat on the stage preparing materials.
1:28:26|1:28:43|Seeing that the time was almost up, he stood up to ring the bell of consciousness. The people in the hall all walked back to their seats, and the room gradually quieted down. The defeated German State Secretary John Neesbell and German Foreign Minister Herman Muller also sat down slowly. Their seats were different from those of other countries, with the two of them sitting directly opposite the presidium.
1:28:44|1:28:51|At this moment, [Very Wong] took over the meeting and arrogantly said to John Nisbell and Herman Mueller:
1:29:2|1:29:19|After speaking, [Gu Weijun] and [Mei] walked slowly towards the signing table under the gaze of everyone. Their figures were dejected, hunched over and not daring to lift their heads. Herman Muller sat down slowly, took a deep breath, picked up the pen to sign. His expression was full of unwillingness and sadness.
1:29:19|1:29:25|John Nessel stood behind him, his brow furrowed, staring intently at the treaty. Herman Muller's hand holding the pen trembled slightly.
1:29:26|1:29:38|For a long time, he slowly signed his name. After signing, he put the pen aside, held back tears, stood up from the table, and walked away step by step. Following him, the representative of the victorious country stepped forward to sign.
1:29:38|1:29:55|President [Wilson] of the United States took the lead in sitting at the table. Once seated, he took out his glasses from his pocket and put them on. With a smile on his face and the corners of his mouth upturned, he was in stark contrast to Herman Mueller. He picked up a pen and signed his name on the treaty, while his assistant lit a fire on the candle nearby.
1:29:56|1:30:13|After [Wilson] signed the document, the firearms were already ignited. An assistant placed the firearms next to the signature with a ribbon indicating joint endorsement, to prove that all signatories of this treaty signed together at the same time and place, which also strengthened the anti-counterfeiting effect to a certain extent.
1:30:13|1:30:22|After President [Wilson] signed, French Prime Minister Chris Meng [Suo] followed closely behind, proudly signed his own name and left with a flourish.
1:30:22|1:30:39|Following that were the British Prime Minister, George, and the Italian Prime Minister, Orlando. The two of them were as serious as usual, showing no expression, with casual movements, as if this treaty was just an ordinary document. After several representatives from different countries signed their names, it was finally China's turn to take the stage.
1:30:39|1:30:44|[Gu Weijun] slowly stood up and the reporters standing next to him raised their cameras and aimed at him.
1:30:45|1:31:3|[Gu Weijun] showed rare signs of panic and worry on his face at this moment. He seemed to be pondering something and also worrying about something. He walked slowly towards the signing table, but did not stop there. He continued to move forward and finally stopped in front of the rostrum. On the rostrum, several people looked at him inexplicably.
1:31:3|1:31:7|[Gou Weijun] took a deep breath and said slowly.
1:31:17|1:31:31|He scanned the room, his words stuck in his throat for a moment. After another pause, whispers started among the audience.
1:32:27|1:32:37|When it came to this point, [Gu Weijun] furrowed his brows. [Gu Weijun] clenched his teeth, feeling unbearable heartache as he looked at the contract filled with words, slowly closing it.
1:32:44|1:32:46|The whole scene was in an uproar, followed by [Gu Weijun] speaking.
1:33:3|1:33:20|[Gu Weijun] forcefully knocked on the contract with his hand, then left the hall quietly. The anger on his face had not subsided, his eyes looking straight ahead with determination. Reporters rushed forward, vying to occupy the best position to capture this decisive moment. Wang Zhengting followed closely behind, walking out with a cool and proud demeanor.
1:33:20|1:33:32|The hall instantly boiled over, everyone was discussing the matter. [Xiao Kejian] stood up and fiercely hammered a gavel, but to no avail. He repeatedly struck it several times, but no one paid any attention, and the situation completely spiraled out of control.
1:33:32|1:33:41|The large door slowly opened, [Gu Weijun] and [Wang Zhengping] walked out side by side, and both involuntarily paused at the door, obviously still not recovered.
1:33:46|1:33:55|China is the only victorious country that did not sign the agreement. [Gu Weijun] and [Wang Zhengping] walked slowly towards their car, opened the door and got in.
1:34:5|1:34:17|The car started slowly, with [Gu Weijun] and [Wang Zhengping] remaining silent. [Wang Zhengping] looked out the window with a sad expression on his face. [Gu Weijun] had a vacant look in his eyes, he put on his hat, showing no signs of vitality.
1:34:31|1:34:36|[Gu Weijun] pondered with a thoughtful expression, and the figure of [Xiao Kejian] involuntarily appeared in his mind.
1:34:52|1:35:6|The car drove up to the iron gate of the Palace of Versailles, where many people were standing behind the railing. [Mei] stood at the front, her eyes swollen and tears on the verge of falling. She stared intently inside, quietly waiting for news from the Chinese delegation.
1:35:6|1:35:20|Running on the street, shouting victory, the soldier is also here at this moment. She is still naked and injured, with messy hair. The only change is that the cans that used to cover her whole body are now reduced to just one. She hangs on the iron gate, singing religious songs loudly.
1:35:21|1:35:33|Let Naya come here, besides him, there are also many French people gathered here, everyone's eyes are on the soldier, the emotions in everyone's eyes are very complex, [Gu Weijun] at this time frowns, extremely melancholy.
