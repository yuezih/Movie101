0:3:38|0:3:47|Fireworks and cannons were booming on the bustling street, while inside this hotel,
0:4:34|0:4:46|The agents approached to inspect the food. When they saw the window glass shattered, they immediately aimed their guns. After the agents approached and confirmed that there was nothing unusual, they relaxed their guard.
0:4:48|0:4:52|He didn't check the food and approved it to be served, the steward took it away and walked up.
0:4:57|0:5:3|Mr. Fan glanced at the steamed chicken.
0:5:4|0:5:29|As soon as the words fell, the stewardess opened the steamer and pulled out a gun, shooting Ye Jianbo dead with two shots. The spies immediately opened fire at him, only to see him fleeing in panic towards the door, and just as he was about to reach the door, he was shot in the leg. The spies took the opportunity to chase after him, while Mr. Fan sat at the table, looking in horror at Ye Jianbo's body.
0:5:29|0:5:36|More and more news about assassinations and attacks are appearing in the newspapers. The headline reads "Ye Jianbo Assassinated".
0:5:36|0:5:52|The Tenth Army of the Central China Front, led by Colonel Kusunoki, was poisoned. The Thirty-Fourth Division, led by General Gongben Musashi, was ambushed. Even the Epidemic Prevention Water Supply Research Base of the Kwantung Army was attacked. The Central China dispatched military transport vehicles were bombed. Colonel Tanaka Shigemitsu of the Fifteenth Division was ambushed.
0:5:52|0:6:8|A series of reports, a stack of newspapers, have exposed all the negative news about the puppet government and the Japanese army, casting a terrifying atmosphere. Even within their ranks, more and more military and political leaders are also filled with fear and unease, unable to find peace.
0:6:10|0:6:25|In the interrogation room of the Japanese East China Special Police Branch that day, the female assassin sat on the ground, the blood on her legs had just dried up. Beside her, the head of the secret service [Wang Tianxiang] sniffed a brush. The female assassin looked at him in extreme fear.
0:6:37|0:7:3|Wang Tianxiang brushed the spices on the female assassin's chest. The female assassin looked at him in horror, but had no intention of betraying the organization. The chief of the secret service didn't want to waste time, so he picked up the spices and sprinkled them on the chest of the female agent. Then, he got up and walked to the pool to wash his hands. His subordinate turned on the faucet for him.
0:7:8|0:7:12|The hunting dog barks wildly. The female spy is extremely nervous.
0:7:21|0:7:29|The hunting dog gnawed on the part smeared with spices. The head of the Imperial Army's secret service, [Wu Tian], arrived at the dungeon. [Wu Tian] slowed down and turned around.
0:7:45|0:8:1|Uncle Liu bowed and took his orders. Finally, he followed [Wang Tianxiang] to the interrogation room. Meanwhile, back at the headquarters, [Wu Tian] was being questioned by a major general. The task of destroying the assassination organization had been handed over to the anti-bandit headquarters of the Wang government.
0:8:21|0:8:31|General [Wu Tian] harshly mocked his unreliable intuition. At this point, [Wu Tian] could no longer argue back, as intuition without any evidence is hard to convince others.
0:8:32|0:8:37|He stared at the general, took two steps back, and suddenly knelt down in front of the general.
0:8:38|0:9:6|The lieutenant general was slightly stunned. [Wu Tian] placed his hands on his thighs and made his final request. After speaking, [Wu Tian] bowed his head, and the lieutenant general remained silent. On the other side, the old man known as Uncle Six walked out of the military police department escorted by Japanese military officers. As they parted ways, they exchanged greetings. Inside the interrogation room,
0:9:6|0:9:26|The spy was cleaning the iron frame. The female assassin lay on the ground, with a horrifying look of death. Silver needles were inserted into her temples and eye corners, and there were bloodstains on her face and chest. [Wu Tian] stood by the window in the office, as [Wang Tianxiang] approached and handed over a tattered notebook. Ignoring her, [Wu Tian] turned back to his chair.
0:9:27|0:9:31|[Wang Tianxiang] was a little unhappy, holding a notebook and following behind.
0:9:42|0:10:4|[Wu Tian] lowered his head and pondered for a moment while leaning on the chair. He lightly tapped the table with his fingers, and [Wang Tianxiang] understood, putting down the small notebook. [Wu Tian] put on white gloves with both hands and gently turned over the tattered notebook's cover page.
0:10:8|0:10:31|In front of the City God Temple, there are people sharpening scissors and various small vendors, with people coming and going on the street. At this moment, the Japanese soldiers on a running training march pass by. Inside a car on the roadside, [Wang Tianxiang] is smoking and staring into the distance. Meanwhile, an old man with a hat and a limp, carrying a bag and smoking a cigarette, walks among the crowd.
0:10:31|0:10:59|His limping figure quickly caught the attention of the disguised spy. At the corner, the spy disguised as a foreign carter also recognized the limping man. Meanwhile, the old man continued walking towards the notice board unknowingly. The carter hurriedly turned back and ran to the front of the car. The chief heard a moment of silence, then pondered for a while, and took a puff of his cigarette.
0:11:0|0:11:5|The foreign coachman turned and ran away. On the street, Grandpa Xue continued to stagger towards the bulletin board.
0:11:6|0:11:11|The spy behind was about to catch someone red-handed, when the foreign coachman rushed over to stop him.
0:11:13|0:11:31|Disguised spies pass messages to each other. Mr. Xue is completely unaware, still pasting glue on the bulletin board. His expression is dull, his actions natural, and no one can tell he is on a mission. After finishing, he carries the bucket into the crowd.
0:11:52|0:12:8|Wu Tian drew some circles on the map. After speaking, he stretched lazily. A confidential intelligence report was transmitted through the office telegraph machine in the form of radio electromagnetic waves, passing through complex equipment and being output at the terminal.
0:12:8|0:12:33|Recent terrorist activities have been rampant, and it seems that our intelligence channels have been infiltrated. Imperial Vice Admiral Kakeo Yoshio invites Commander Zhang and relevant personnel of the Anti-Bandit Command to discuss the intelligence operation process at Baicaotang in the western suburbs on the evening of October 31 at 9:00. The full content of the secret telegram has been sent to the Wang Wei East China Anti-Bandit Command.
0:12:33|0:12:51|This secret telegram is a trap set by Colonel [Wu Tian]. Its purpose is to use the informer to lure out the old ghosts and old guns lurking in the dark. On this day, inside the East China Pacification Bureau of the Wang Puppet Government, in the telegraph room, a group of cipher clerks worked in an orderly manner.
0:12:52|0:13:8|Some are tapping on the telegraph machine to send messages, some are consulting the codebook to translate telegrams, while at the front, [Gu Xiaomeng] is making a phone call and taking notes on the documents. Afterwards, she hangs up the phone, puts the written content into a folder, and walks quickly into the inner office.
0:13:9|0:13:23|She handed the folder to the leader of the translation team [Li Ningyu]. [Li Ningyu] opened the folder, took out the manuscript inside and flipped through it, then closed the folder, copied the manuscript onto another piece of paper.
0:13:24|0:13:40|Receiving and Dispatching Officer [Gu Xiaomeng] walked into the director's office holding a folder. Coincidentally, the captain of the Counter-Espionage Team, [Wu Zhiguo], was also in the room. The director answered the phone with one hand and took the folder with the other. [Wu Zhiguo] took out a lighter, lit a cigarette, and approached.
0:13:41|0:13:56|He took a deep drag on his cigarette and walked over to the director. The director impatiently hung up the phone and then closed the folder before leaving the office. This man is Jin Shenghuo, the director of the military intelligence department. He walked quickly towards the commander's office with the folder in hand.
0:14:0|0:14:8|Upon entering, he saw only Colonel [Bai Xiaonian] leaning on the sofa. When [Bai Xiaonian] saw the director, he stood up to take the documents.
0:14:10|0:14:16|[Bai Xiaonian] snorted, snatched the folder, flipped through it, and pushed open the door to walk into the commander's inner room.
0:14:19|0:14:41|Pushing the door open, [Bai Xiaonian] holding a file, quickly walked to the commander's desk and put it in the drawer. Two days later at the City God Temple, in the evening, pedestrians were bustling. Old Xue carried a bucket of paste to the bulletin board, where he leisurely posted a lottery notice. After finishing these tasks, he carried the bucket and left.
0:14:41|0:14:49|And the information conveyed by this lottery announcement is: On October 31st, gather at Baicaotang and launch a surprise attack.
0:14:54|0:15:13|In the nightclub filled with revelry at night, handsome men and beautiful women sway on the dance floor. Among them, there are young elites from the military and business world coming to drink and have fun. [Gu Xiaomeng] is dancing with a young white man. Meanwhile, [Li Ningyu] is leaning on the bar smoking a cigarette, with a half-empty glass of liquor in front of her.
0:15:13|0:15:28|The beautiful [Li Ningyu] looks worried, as if she has something on her mind. She stares at the ashtray, smoking a cigarette. In the dance floor, [Gu Xiaomeng] is having a great time, performing difficult dance moves with the help of her partner. The bartender answers the phone at the bar.
0:15:31|0:15:41|[Li Ningyu] stared at the bartender, as if expecting something. [Gu Xiaomeng] made her way through the crowded people towards the bar. [Li Ningyu] noticed the return of [Gu Xiaomeng] and finished the glass of whiskey in her hand.
0:15:41|0:15:52|[Gu Xiaomeng] answers the phone. After hanging up, [Gu Xiaomeng] grabs a bottle of liquor and leans in to greet [Li Ningyu].
0:15:55|0:16:16|[Li Ningyu] stood up and extinguished the cigarette in her hand. [Gu Xiaomeng] picked up the cup and gulped down the liquor, leaving a tip. The two put on their coats and left gracefully. Late at night, a car was driving on a mountain road, with [Bai Xiaonian], [Gu Xiaomeng], [Li Ningyu], [Wu Zhiguo], and [Jin Shenghuo] inside.
0:16:16|0:16:29|After drinking too much, [Gu Xiaomeng] couldn't bear the bumpiness and leaned against the window, vomiting. The unpleasant smell spread in the car. Everyone took out handkerchiefs, covering their noses or fanning gently.
0:16:31|0:16:36|A car arrived at a gate, and the soldiers stationed on both sides quickly moved the roadblocks aside.
0:16:37|0:16:58|After the car smoothly passed through, it stopped by the side of a small road not long after. The winding and narrow road was only wide enough for one person to pass through. On both sides of the road stood two bunkers, with huge searchlights shining brightly. The guard opened the car door. [Wu Zhiguo] stepped out first, followed by the director [Jin Shenghuo],
0:16:58|0:17:4|Translation team leader [Li Ningyu] and communications officer [Gu Xiaomeng]. The rugged mountain path at night,
0:17:5|0:17:22|[Gu Xiaomeng] and [Li Ningyu] supported each other as they moved forward. The group arrived at a steel bridge, surrounded by a sinister atmosphere. Unable to hold back, [Gu Xiaomeng] muttered under her breath.
0:17:24|0:17:40|As the chief of staff [Bai Xiaonian] clears up the confusion for everyone. They arrive at the bridge. [Wu Zhiguo] sees the Japanese warning sign on the side.
0:17:43|0:17:49|Everyone followed [Bai Xiaonian]'s gaze.
0:18:8|0:18:24|[Bai Xiaonian] seductively pushed aside [Gu Xiaomeng] and walked towards the room. With him leading the way, everyone followed suit. In the end, only [Li Ningyu] walked with her good friend [Gu Xiaomeng]. As the two passed by the head of the secret service [Wang Tianxiang], [Gu Xiaomeng] took the opportunity to provocatively glance at him.
0:18:24|0:18:43|Before long, everyone walked into the mansion one after another. With the loud slam of the door, it signaled the beginning of this special meeting. Following the stairs, the guards pointed out each person's room.
0:18:54|0:18:58|[Li Ningyu] dragged [Gu Xiaomeng] towards the room.
0:18:59|0:19:8|Pushing open the door, [Gu Xiaomeng] didn't have time to inspect the exquisite furniture, and quickly walked towards the bathroom. She turned on the light, pushed open the door, and headed straight for the toilet.
0:19:9|0:19:34|In the living room, [Li Ningyu] looked around, pondering something. The sound of flushing came from the bathroom. Several secret agents in the downstairs hall retreated to the steel bridge, accidentally making a noise. Half an hour had passed unnoticed. [Li Ningyu] supported [Gu Xiaomeng] and quickly walked into the meeting room. [Jin Shenghuo] looked at the lottery ticket.
0:19:34|0:19:48|Everyone sat around a long table, each with a lottery ticket with a lame old man's face on it placed in front of them.
0:20:32|0:20:40|[Bai Xiaonian] revealed that the commander did not approve of this matter, and everyone started to joke around.
0:21:17|0:21:21|[Wu Zhiguo] stood up and snatched the newspaper that [Wang Tianxiang] was reading.
0:21:30|0:21:34|In the shadows, [Wu Tian] throws the original document onto the table.
0:21:36|0:21:43|[Wang Tianxiang] stood up first when she saw the familiar notebook. [Wu Tian] walked out from the shadows until the light illuminated his face.
0:22:1|0:22:9|[Wu Tian] scanned everyone with sharp eyes, and [Gu Xiaomeng], who hadn't sobered up yet, almost vomited again.
0:22:10|0:22:24|At the long table, [Wu Tian] sat high at the head, watching the progress of decryption by [Li Ningyu] and [Gu Xiaomeng]. As the leader of the translation team, this task was not difficult for [Li Ningyu]. She flipped through the original document, outlining it.
0:23:0|0:23:9|[Li Ningyu] writes each combination on a piece of paper, constantly trying to piece it together.
0:23:15|0:23:25|Awakening from her drunken stupor, [Gu Xiaomeng] stared at [Li Ningyu] with bleary eyes and asked. [Li Ningyu] rearranged the order.
0:23:26|0:23:42|Wu Tian looked up at Li Ningyu at this moment. On the other side, the three men on the sofa suddenly became attentive as well. The pieces of paper on the table with numbers on them had already been filled with corresponding Chinese characters at some point. When the 14 Chinese characters were arranged into a coherent sentence, it read:
0:23:43|0:24:9|On October 31st, everyone gathered at Baicaotang to ambush the enemy. The tense atmosphere spread instantly. As they approached to find out the result, [Gu Xiaomeng] lit a cigarette. When she looked up again, everyone had surrounded her. [Li Ningyu] took a drag of the cigarette and slowly spoke. As soon as these words were spoken, the expressions of everyone changed.
0:24:9|0:24:22|Wang Tianxiang on the sofa looked over and slowly stood up to walk over. He held up the translated cipher message with two fingers to show everyone.
0:24:38|0:24:45|[Wu Tian] looked confidently at the crowd. Upon hearing this, [Jin Shenghuo] showed an expression of disbelief.
0:24:47|0:24:55|[Bai Xiaonian] stared with his eyes wide open, as if trying to identify the traitor.
0:24:59|0:25:6|This made everyone feel uneasy, and [Jin Shenghuo] quickly threw the untimely biscuit in his hand into the ashtray.
0:25:7|0:25:15|[Wu Tian] did not stay, and then walked away. Everyone kept staring until they couldn't see his figure anymore.
0:25:20|0:25:48|[Gu Xiaomeng] laughed, and [Wang Tianxiang] glared at her. Unable to hold back her laughter, [Gu Xiaomeng] covered her mouth. As the night grew deeper, the mansion on the coastal road exuded a mysterious atmosphere. A telescope was scanning the balconies of the suspects. Walking towards the window, [Wu Zhiguo] seemed to sense that someone was watching.
0:25:48|0:26:4|The owner of the telescope quickly changed the target. This time, the target under surveillance is [Li Ningyu], who is writing at the window. The owner of the telescope is [Wang Tianxiang]. He had just put down the telescope when he locked onto the next target. Faintly through the window,
0:26:4|0:26:12|The figure lying on the bed, already drowsy, is none other than [Jin Shenghuo]. He suddenly hears a noise.
0:26:14|0:26:33|He immediately sat up, reaching for the gun under the pillow and looking outside. [Jin Shenghuo] was still somewhat uneasy, so he put on his clothes and took the gun out. In the silent night, he was wide awake, looking around. The leaked secret information made him feel very uneasy.
0:26:34|0:26:51|Director Wang and [Wu Tian]'s attitude made him particularly worried about whether he could safely leave here. On the other side, [Gu Xiaomeng] lay on the silk bed in clothes, staring blankly at the ceiling. [Li Ningyu] was still sitting by the window, writing under the desk lamp. [Gu Xiaomeng] walked over and patted [Li Ningyu] on the shoulder.
0:27:0|0:27:7|[Gu Xiaomeng] leaned over the table to deliberately amuse [Li Ningyu].
0:27:13|0:27:20|Li Ningyu, who was preparing to pour tea, stopped her movements and turned around to look at Gu Xiaomeng. She put down the teapot and handed her a teacup.
0:27:21|0:27:30|[Gu Xiaomeng] suddenly pointed at [Li Ningyu].
0:27:40|0:28:3|[Li Ningyu] looked in the mirror to check the opening under her armpit. [Gu Xiaomeng] said as she brought out a sewing kit. She squatted down to help [Li Ningyu] untie her qipao. [Li Ningyu] took off the qipao, which [Gu Xiaomeng] took from her hand. Holding the qipao and the sewing kit, she quickly walked over and sat cross-legged on the high-end sofa.
0:28:10|0:28:17|[Li Ningyu] sat down next to [Gu Xiaomeng] with her clothes on. [Gu Xiaomeng] was sewing, carefully observing [Li Ningyu].
0:28:23|0:28:37|[Gu Xiaomeng] blinked her beautiful eyes and looked at [Li Ningyu]. [Li Ningyu] looked back, and [Gu Xiaomeng] had already started to lower her head and work as a female worker. She reached out for those delicate hands that were sewing.
0:28:38|0:28:46|With red eyes, [Li Ningyu] opened her mouth but didn't say anything. She opened her arms and threw herself into [Gu Xiaomeng]'s embrace, and [Gu Xiaomeng] gently held her.
0:28:49|0:29:10|Li Ningyu was worried about her missing boyfriend. Suddenly, a faint opera singing could be heard from outside the window, Gu Xiaomeng looked over. Li Ningyu stood up. She walked towards the balcony. Li Ningyu gently opened the balcony door and stepped out. The one singing opera on the neighboring balcony was Wu Zhiguo.
0:29:45|0:29:52|[Li Ningyu] took out a delicate cigarette case, pulled out a red circle, and walked to the edge of the balcony.
0:29:55|0:30:2|[Wu Zhiguo] caught it with both hands and lit it for himself. The two of them puffed on their cigarettes, blowing out smoke. After a while, [Wu Zhiguo] cleared his throat.
0:30:21|0:30:38|[Wu Zhiguo] looked over and saw [Gu Xiaomeng] had also arrived on the balcony at some point. Even the balcony was bugged.
0:30:58|0:31:16|After speaking, [Gu Xiaomeng] playfully raised her eyebrows at [Wu Zhiguo]. [Wu Zhiguo] tilted his head back and exhaled smoke, as if trying to release his inner worries. [Wang Tianxiang] was keeping watch in the distance when [Wu Tian] approached and took the binoculars.
0:31:20|0:31:32|Li Ningyu in the distance stared blankly downstairs. Wu Tian returned the telescope to Wang Tianxiang, then went back into the house with Wang Tianxiang following.
0:31:33|0:31:48|Wang Tianxiang didn't quite understand. Wu Tian picked up a book and flipped through it.
0:32:0|0:32:21|[Wu Tian] put down the book and walked away. [Wang Tianxiang] was still pondering how to identify these tough opponents. Chinese characters appeared on the woven texture: "I was too careless, fell into a trap, the Japanese invaders must have set a trap at Baicaotang to capture and kill comrades. The message to cancel the operation must be sent out within 5 days, otherwise death is inevitable."
0:32:22|0:32:37|On the small island surrounded by the sea on three sides stand two gloomy buildings. This is where everyone is being held captive this time. Sunlight streams into Bai Xiaonian's room. He sings opera, swaying his body in front of a mirror with precision.
0:32:37|0:33:1|He twisted his orchid fingers in front of the mirror. Suddenly, he stopped and leaned in to tidy up his sideburns. With a focused expression, he used both hands to adjust them, looking like a young lady. [Bai Xiaonian] walked slowly down the stairs, while the others had already started their meal.
0:33:7|0:33:10|Jin Shenghuo, who was eating heartily, suddenly choked upon hearing the words.
0:33:19|0:33:40|In the midst of intrigue and scheming, this breakfast is coming to an end. In the exquisite room, [Gu Xiaomeng] sits at the dressing table, whistling as she applies new nail polish to herself. She admires her beautiful hands in the mirror. Meanwhile, downstairs, the Japanese woman sings for the Japanese army. On the single sofa beside her,
0:34:40|0:34:52|On the other side, the door opened and [Gu Xiaomeng], dressed lightly, holding a piece of paper, swayed towards the guard on duty.
0:35:9|0:35:28|[Gu Xiaomeng] rolled her eyes. She leaned against the guard and slipped the paper into the guard's pocket.
0:35:50|0:35:58|[Gu Xiaomeng] carefully recalled it.
0:36:5|0:36:12|[Gu Xiaomeng] was quite surprised. She raised her eyebrows and looked elsewhere, saying somewhat reluctantly.
0:36:41|0:36:55|After saying that, she raised her beautiful eyes and raised her eyebrows. The sea breeze blew over the island, and a man walked across the iron bridge connecting the two buildings.
0:37:7|0:37:18|The two sat on the sofa, each with an air of mutual respect. [Wu Zhiguo] got up, picked up his coat, and was about to leave.
0:37:25|0:37:49|[Wu Zhiguo] stopped his actions and waited impatiently for [Wang Tianxiang] to continue. [Li Ningyu] walked through the doorway and passed by Captain Wu without any interaction. She glanced over and caught the eye of [Wu Tian] by the choir. Sitting on the sofa, [Li Ningyu] smoked a cigarette and spoke.
0:37:50|0:38:7|After speaking, she took a deep drag on her cigarette. [Wang Tianxiang] looked at her with a hint of surprise. On the other side, [Wu Tian] was holding the letter written by [Gu Xiaomeng], carefully examining it in the sunlight.
0:38:17|0:38:32|[Wu Tian] leaned in, furrowing his brow as he looked at the list. [Wu Tian] stood up, interrupting him mid-sentence.
0:39:0|0:39:8|[Wang Tianxiang] was overjoyed at the news. Inside the hall, the on-duty guard was leaning against the railing, fast asleep.
0:39:9|0:39:27|Several people sat around the dining table, but none of them seemed interested. [Gu Xiaomeng] leaned forward, showing concern for [Li Ningyu]. [Li Ningyu] softened her expression and smiled back. [Jin Shenghuo] slammed the table indignantly.
0:40:0|0:40:6|[Wu Zhiguo] smashed the wine bottle, and everyone immediately quieted down. He slowly stood up, his gaze sweeping over the crowd, and said fiercely.
0:40:8|0:40:21|[Wu Zhiguo] sarcastically taunted [Gu Xiaomeng]. The people present looked at each other. [Gu Xiaomeng] walked quickly around the table.
0:40:29|0:40:32|[Wu Zhiguo] forcefully pulled open his collar, revealing the bullet hole on his chest.
0:40:40|0:40:46|[Gu Xiaomeng] frowned coldly and stood up to speak.
0:40:50|0:40:54|She leaned against the table without giving in.
0:41:24|0:41:32|Wu Zhiguo, a man with a strong sense of masculinity, couldn't hide his anger when he heard the words. He pointed fiercely at Gu Xiaomeng with his index finger, and was about to leave this farce.
0:41:35|0:41:46|Unexpectedly, [Wang Tianxiang] who came from the dark stopped him and said with a smile. [Wu Zhiguo] looked cold and gave [Wang Tianxiang] a sideways glance before turning around and heading straight upstairs.
0:41:50|0:42:0|[Li Ningyu] stood up for [Gu Xiaomeng], then quickly took [Gu Xiaomeng] upstairs to the room. [Jin Shenghuo] wiped off some sweat and picked up the chopsticks.
0:42:4|0:42:25|After speaking, he looked at the expressions of the few people, trying to find flaws. Chinese characters reappeared on the web pattern: it feels like no one can walk out of here. Without extraordinary means, it would be difficult to send out any messages. The next day, [Wang Tianxiang] walked through the hall, turned on the record player, and quickly went upstairs with documents.
0:42:35|0:42:50|Everyone received the documents personally delivered by [Wang Tianxiang]. They all filled in their relevant information.
0:42:51|0:43:5|With either a ballpoint pen or a brush, the characters were written in meticulous regular script. [Gu Xiaomeng] turned her head to look at her friend [Li Ningyu], who was writing earnestly. [Gu Xiaomeng] and [Wu Zhiguo] on the other side faintly sensed that something was amiss.
0:43:6|0:43:26|On the outdoor terrace, [Wang Tianxiang] was blowing the sea breeze, lost in thought. Meanwhile, inside the room, [Wu Tian] was carefully examining the documents. He threw the documents to his two subordinates, who compared the handwriting on the lottery advertisement brought back that day one by one. They spared no effort in using a vernier caliper to measure the length of the strokes and a magnifying glass to observe the pen strokes.
0:43:26|0:43:35|Accurate measurements, precise comparisons, repeated tests. After who knows how long, finally a clue was found in the handwriting.
0:43:36|0:43:53|On the other side, [Gu Xiaomeng] lit a cigarette, swaying her waist as she danced gracefully in the room. The old record player filled the room with a tranquil atmosphere, while [Li Ningyu] on the long sofa was covered with a blanket, still immersed in dreams. With a graceful figure and full of beauty, [Gu Xiaomeng] leaned back in the chair, smoking.
0:43:53|0:44:12|Quietly looking at [Li Ningyu], she seemed to be thinking when these leisurely days became precious. Unexpectedly, the power suddenly went out, and the room was pitch black. Then, the lights in two buildings also went out one after another. In the darkness, [Gu Xiaomeng] flicked the cigarette ash lightly. The footsteps outside woke up [Li Ningyu].
0:44:20|0:44:30|[Gu Xiaomeng] shook her head slightly, feeling puzzled. [Li Ningyu] got up and walked towards the door. The sudden power outage gave her a sense of foreboding. She pressed her ear against the door, listening carefully.
0:44:33|0:44:50|The commotion sounds like [Bai Xiaonian] has encountered an accident. [Li Ningyu] quickly ran to the balcony to look out. On the iron bridge connecting the two paths, two secret agents were holding flashlights and escorting [Bai Xiaonian] away. Inside the house, [Gu Xiaomeng] also approached and peered out the window. [Li Ningyu] looked anxious and did not speak.
0:44:52|0:45:6|In the dungeon, two people are dragging [Bai Xiaonian] from the front, while the secret agent behind him covers his mouth and holds a kerosene lamp. Several people together push [Bai Xiaonian] into the elevator, and the elevator door is tightly closed. [Bai Xiaonian] struggles in vain as the elevator slowly descends.
0:45:6|0:45:21|[Bai Xiaonian] was brought to the edge of a large pool in a bathhouse. The secret agents threw a wooden board on the ground, and then two henchmen brought over a tiger stool, trapping [Bai Xiaonian] in the chair. Across from him sat [Wu Tian], casually playing with a cigarette in his hand.
0:45:26|0:45:34|Trapped, [Bai Xiaonian] stared in terror at two documents.
0:45:42|0:46:0|[Wang Tianxiang] sneered and stepped back, signaling to his men to begin. Two agents untied [Bai Xiaonian]'s hands and feet. He was extremely terrified. Another agent walked up, grabbed [Bai Xiaonian]'s hair, and dragged him step by step into another room, then ruthlessly threw him on the ground. The door of the room slammed shut.
0:46:1|0:46:24|[Bai Xiaonian] looked up at [Director Wang], who seemed like a demon from the abyss, with extreme terror. The two secret agents immediately complied. He screamed in despair. In the corner, a secret agent was sharpening an iron spike bench, with one particularly sharp and thick in the middle. [Wang Tianxiang] looked at the dignified officer in this manner and laughed from the bottom of her heart.
0:46:25|0:46:40|Outside the execution room, [Wu Tian] stood up and left after hearing the heart-wrenching screams. He even thought about how to calm Commander Zhang's anger if [Bai Xiaonian] was not the mole. In fact, Commander Zhang, who was on a business trip in Nanjing, had just received the news and rushed to Qiuzhuang.
0:46:41|0:46:48|The commander's car has just arrived, and [Wang Tianxiang] leads the team to greet. His attendants stopped the commander's bodyguards, only [Wang Tianxiang] entered the house.
0:46:49|0:47:4|[Wu Tian] and the commander sat upright. [Wang Tianxiang] approached, the commander glared fiercely and kicked [Wang Tianxiang] down. [Wang Tianxiang] immediately got up and stood straight, while [Wu Tian] beside couldn't help but burst into laughter.
0:47:8|0:47:15|Commander looked at [Wang Tianxiang] and then at [Wu Tian] with confusion. As Commander Zhang was about to question them, [Wu Tian] brought up Rear Admiral Kusunoki.
0:47:19|0:47:35|The commander didn't react angrily either. After Wu Tian finished speaking, he looked at [Wang Tianxiang].
0:47:36|0:47:43|Under Wu Tian's urging, Wang Tianxiang turned and left. Before long, the commander sat in front of the lamp, carefully comparing the two sets of handwriting.
0:47:52|0:48:17|The commander's tiger eyes stared at [Wu Tian], who smiled confidently. The commander leaned on his crutch and walked step by step towards the interrogation room. He had to find out from [Bai Xiaonian]. Climbing out of the pool, [Bai Xiaonian],
0:48:25|0:48:50|The commander swung his whip, leaving a cut on [Bai Xiaonian]'s face. [Bai Xiaonian], who had been waiting for a savior, was now completely broken inside. He sobbed as he crawled to the water pool, defiantly looking up at the commander. The building, plunged into darkness due to a power outage, was now lit by a figure carrying a lamp walking up the stairs.
0:48:50|0:49:8|To everyone, this was destined to be a sleepless night. In the darkness, [Wu Zhiguo] was quietly smoking. [Gu Xiaomeng] and [Li Ningyu] were huddled together on a sofa. A figure stood still at the door. In the room next door, [Jin Shenghuo] sat on the sofa, raising a pistol nervously watching the doorway.
0:49:8|0:49:18|Outside the door, the spy with the key then arrived at another door. Inside the room were Gu Xiaomeng and Li Ningyu.
0:49:20|0:49:27|The knocking on the door struck the heart, [Li Ningyu] stopped [Gu Xiaomeng] and went to open the door herself. The flashlight shone directly on her face.
0:49:32|0:49:48|In the dark night, [Li Ningyu] walked towards the car alone, wrapped in clothes. Upstairs, [Gu Xiaomeng] looked nervously, she didn't expect that misfortune would come so quickly to her side. In another building, a woman in a kimono led the way ahead.
0:49:48|0:49:58|[Li Ningyu] followed him through the hall, passing by the choir, and arrived at a door with a painting hanging on it. The woman in kimono opened the door skillfully and walked in first.
0:50:0|0:50:6|The moonlight spilled down, imprinting [Li Ningyu]'s exquisite profile on the hanging scroll. After a moment of hesitation, she followed and entered the door.
0:50:7|0:50:15|The woman in kimono carried the lamp prepared at the door and walked deeper into the darkness. In the pitch-black alley, [Li Ningyu] could only follow the only source of light.
0:50:16|0:50:27|Approaching the corner, the woman in kimono was very polite, making a gesture of invitation. I saw Li Ningyu walking in front, with her behind, holding the lamp high, until the two entered the elevator.
0:50:29|0:50:44|Before long, the elevator doors opened and the two of them walked out slowly. She walked forward along the damp corridor in high heels. The environment here was hard to describe in words. It was more like a hole dug out by a giant rat, gloomy, dark, and damp.
0:50:48|0:50:54|The woman in kimono stopped and asked [Li Ningyu] to wait here while she signaled the guard to open the door. The wooden sign next to them was painted with,
0:50:55|0:51:3|No trespassing. This time the kimono woman did not lead the way. As [Li Ningyu] stepped into the door, the heavy iron gate was already locked.
0:51:4|0:51:12|[Li Ningyu] glanced around the room and saw [Wu Tian] sitting in the middle of the chair in a kimono. [Wu Tian] closed the book in his arms and looked at her with a smile.
0:51:13|0:51:28|And at this moment in the hall, [Wang Tianxiang] grabbed the kerosene lamp and headed straight upstairs.
0:51:59|0:52:2|[Wang Tianxiang] quickly picked up the kerosene lamp and hurried away.
0:52:5|0:52:14|In the interrogation room, [Wu Tian] looked at the well-proportioned figure under [Li Ningyu]'s cheongsam. [Li Ningyu] nodded under the light.
0:52:16|0:52:35|She watched Wu Tian vigilantly. After learning about the whereabouts of her long-lost boyfriend, Li Ningyu couldn't help but ask. Wu Tian walked towards Li Ningyu, who stared at him with a look of disgust and dissatisfaction. She was unsure of what this man was up to.
0:52:35|0:52:47|At that time, [Wang Tianxiang] carried a lamp and personally went to the other side of the building to investigate the situation of [Gu Xiaomeng]. The soldier saluted.
0:52:57|0:53:9|The soldier walked towards the door, [Wang Tianxiang] casually placed the lamp on the table and hid in the dark to observe. Just as the soldier raised his hand, the door was opened, and out came the disheveled [Wu Zhiguo].
0:53:10|0:53:18|[Wu Zhiguo] frowned and waved his hand.
0:53:19|0:53:36|After saying that, [Wu Zhiguo] ignored the soldiers and walked towards his room. On the desk in the interrogation room, there was a book on human anatomy. Wu Tian picked up the lottery advertisement on the table and looked at [Li Ningyu]. Finally, he tore it off.
0:54:22|0:54:39|Wu Tian stared intently at Li Ningyu in front of him, as if trying to see through this woman. On the other side, Wang Tianxiang came to Gu Xiaomeng's room and knocked on the door, but there was no response from inside. Wang Tianxiang persisted in asking.
0:54:40|0:54:51|The room was still silent. [Wang Tianxiang] was eager to know what was happening, but also worried that being too obvious would expose the listening devices. Just then, [Gu Xiaomeng] opened the door.
0:55:0|0:55:8|[Gu Xiaomeng], who was about to close the door, was stopped by [Wang Tianxiang]. [Wang Tianxiang] took out a box of snacks and gave it to her.
0:55:16|0:55:34|She gently took the snacks handed to her by [Wang Tianxiang] and cursed under her breath. In the interrogation room, [Wu Tian] brought in a box. The box was not big, but when opened, it contained a complete set of tools, like a medical kit. Inside, there were three small drawers.
0:55:36|0:55:53|Every layer is densely packed with stainless steel tools. [Wu Tian] takes out a small knife from it. [Wu Tian] selects tools from the box.
0:56:2|0:56:11|He calmly put on the white gloves as if preparing for an important surgery. He walked over with his tools,
0:56:21|0:56:41|Wu Tian reached out to unbutton Li Ningyu's collar, but Li Ningyu dodged backwards. Li Ningyu's final stubbornness was looking away with her head tilted. Tears rolled down Li Ningyu's beautiful face, she tilted her head up, trying not to let the tears fall.
0:56:42|0:56:49|Takeda unbuttoned all the buttons of the cheongsam from the collar to the hem. Takeda gently took off her cheongsam, muttering to himself.
0:56:52|0:56:58|Stripped of her cheongsam, [Li Ningyu] was left with only two thin pieces of underwear. [Wu Tian] continued to brainwash with anatomical knowledge.
0:57:0|0:57:5|[Li Ningyu] collapsed, standing naked in front of this person at the moment. [Wu Tian] slowly lifted her head,
0:57:13|0:57:28|He took out a caliper to measure the size of Li Ningyu's nose, then the mouth, step by step down to the ankle. Li Ningyu's privacy and dignity were completely disregarded at this moment.
0:57:31|0:57:39|Li Ningyu recalled the first time she saw the stage actor Liu Linzong.
0:57:46|0:58:1|At that time, she was watching him joyfully from the audience, and as their eyes met, sparks of love flew. In the dungeon, [Bai Xiaonian] had become a floating corpse, drifting in a dirty pool. With the power outage tonight, too much had already happened.
0:58:2|0:58:16|The characters on the net pattern once again revealed Chinese characters: there is already a countermeasure, just need the help of God. The commander sat back on the sofa with his eyes closed.
0:58:32|0:59:2|The death of Bai Xiaonian made the commander somewhat absent-minded. Wu Tian on the side sofa nodded unwillingly, then gestured to the soldiers.
0:59:3|0:59:12|[Wang Tianxiang] lowered her head, afraid of angering the commander again. [Wu Tian] solemnly adjusted his gloves.
0:59:22|0:59:29|His gaze was sharp, staring ahead, [Wu Tian], who thirsted for the glory of the family, was about to embark on a grand ambition. One morning a month ago,
0:59:39|0:59:46|The military officers in the meeting room called out his name again and again. [Wu Tian] looked up and slowly stood up.
0:59:48|1:0:7|The officer's face changed, his mouth twitched. The officer, instead of getting angry, smiled. He suddenly restrained his smile.
1:0:8|1:0:27|The officer's voice grew louder as he crushed the dignity of the Wu family in front of a group of senior officers. Wu Tian did not explain, but just stared at him intently as he sat down slowly.
1:0:28|1:0:35|Just as [Wu Tian], who had just sat down, suddenly pushed himself up with both hands, leaped onto the table, and pounced on the senior officer who had just mocked him.
1:0:36|1:0:49|Wu Tian pinned him to the ground, venting his anger, while other officers rushed up to pull them apart. When the officer was helped up, his face was pierced by a pen.
1:0:50|1:0:59|The scene shifts, with Wu Tian wearing a cloak, standing on the rooftop gazing into the distance. [Wang Tianxiang] walks up from behind, frowning and bowing to report to Wu Tian.
1:1:0|1:1:6|The two observed the situation through binoculars.
1:1:25|1:1:56|Wu Tian put down the telescope and came up with a plan, saying to the frowning [Wang Tianxiang]. [Wang Tianxiang] immediately understood and left with his entourage. Inside the room, [Gu Xiaomeng] was sitting on the sofa sewing, while [Wu Zhiguo] and [Jin Shenghuo] were bored playing chess. Just then, [Wang Tianxiang] walked out.
1:2:11|1:2:19|On the open space of the cliff in Qiu Zhuang, a long table was set up, with a band playing by the railing and kimono-clad women dancing ahead.
1:2:20|1:2:36|[Wu Zhiguo] applauded as Wu Tian stood up to speak. Wu Tian, dressed in a suit, stood up. After speaking, he raised a glass of clear wine and drank it all. [Wang Tianxiang] smoked a cigarette, squinting his eyes as he looked into the distance. In the distance, the head chef assigned tasks to the cripple, he said.
1:2:38|1:2:57|This was arranged early by [Wang Tianxiang], who was secretly observing the progress of the plan. [Li Ningyu] was busy drinking heavily, pouring foreign liquor into her mouth. Old Lu, holding a cigarette and a tray, limped towards the dining table. He comically swayed his body and arrived next to [Wu Zhiguo].
1:2:57|1:3:11|Putting down the tray, he bent down to pick up the bone plate. Beside him, [Wu Zhiguo] sat smoking indifferently. Lao Lu tidied up the bone plate and then went to [Jin Shenghuo]'s side. He slowly bent down to pick up a chopstick from the ground and stood up.
1:3:11|1:3:28|[Gu Xiaomeng] also collected the other chopstick from [Jin Shenghuo]'s side into the tray. Then, he picked up the remaining dish with both hands and put it back on the tray. [Jin Shenghuo] even made way for him, while [Wang Tianxiang] kept a close eye on every move. At this moment, Old Lu came to [Li Ningyu]'s side.
1:3:29|1:3:36|[ Jin Shenghuo ] across the way looked at her in confusion.
1:3:40|1:4:5|She shouted at Director [Wang] who was staring at Old Lu. Old Lu quickly arranged the tray and avoided [Li Ningyu]. Faced with [Li Ningyu]'s gaze, Director Wang responded with a smile. [Wu Tian] picked up a cigarette to light it, and [Li Ningyu] kept flipping plates onto [Wu Tian].
1:4:24|1:4:44|He reluctantly threw away the match, spat out, and returned to the room. [Wang Tianxiang] sat at the table, next to the window curtain, and [Wu Tian] turned around and walked towards him.
1:4:55|1:4:58|[Wang Tianxiang] had a grim expression and swallowed hard.
1:5:44|1:5:54|[Wang Tianxiang] felt that he had seized the opportunity and was extremely excited.
1:5:55|1:6:14|[Wu Tian] lit a cigarette, sitting across from [Wang Tianxiang] who picked up a match, bent over and lit the cigarette for [Wu Tian]. After the cigarette was lit, [Wu Tian] took two puffs, staring into [Wang Tianxiang]'s eyes. Suddenly, secret agents stormed into the room.
1:6:18|1:6:32|In the West Tower interrogation room, a group of people gathered around a long table. On the table lay the body of [Bai Xiaonian]. [Wang Tianxiang] paced around the table, casting a glance at the military officers present.
1:7:2|1:7:9|[Jin Shenghuo] was overwhelmed by this aura, feeling at a loss for what to do.
1:7:39|1:7:50|[Jin Shenghuo] pulled out a gun to threaten the secret agents and [Wang Tianxiang]. Feeling scared, [Jin Shenghuo] couldn't help but have a slight tremble in the hand holding the gun.
1:8:1|1:8:10|[Jin Shenghuo] aimed at his temple and shot himself, committing suicide. His colleagues who had been together day and night lost their lives at this moment, leaving everyone feeling heavy-hearted.
1:8:11|1:8:36|[Wang Tianxiang], who had checked the body, turned and left, leaving everyone stunned in place. As night fell, darkness would soon descend on this small island. In the interrogation room, two bodies lay horizontally, and in just two days, there had been frequent changes. The once high-ranking officers of the command headquarters not only lost their former spirits at this moment,
1:8:36|1:8:45|One by one, they were exhausted and fearful. This was just the beginning. The sound of the door being smashed startled everyone in the interrogation room.
1:8:57|1:9:23|[Li Ningyu] was taken away by two secret agents without a word. [Gu Xiaomeng] looked at Captain Wu in confusion. As [Li Ningyu] was dragged through the dim and damp corridor, she couldn't resist, let alone fight back, and was dragged all the way to the corner. The leading agent stopped. [Li Ningyu] trembled like chaff.
1:9:25|1:9:31|After issuing a warning, two secret agents escorted [Li Ningyu] towards the elevator. Once inside, soldiers closed the two elevator doors.
1:9:37|1:9:55|The elevator slowly ascended, taking [Li Ningyu] away from this earthly purgatory. Meanwhile, in the office upstairs, [Wang Tianxiang] and [Wu Tian] sat on the sofa. On the other side, the eavesdropper with headphones was ready to record at any moment.
1:9:58|1:10:7|[Wu Tian] leaned against the sofa without saying a word, listening to the tape spinning in the recorder.
1:10:57|1:11:4|[Gu Xiaomeng] was being choked by [Wu Zhiguo].
1:11:7|1:11:23|[Wang Tianxiang] picked up a wooden chair and knocked out [Wu Zhiguo]. In the living room, [Wang Tianxiang] brought a cup of tea for [Gu Xiaomeng] and sat down, looking at the exhausted [Gu Xiaomeng]. With red eyes and trembling lips, [Gu Xiaomeng] sat there.
1:11:24|1:11:47|The continuous pressure over the past few days has gradually worn down [Gu Xiaomeng]'s spirit. Wiping away a tear, [Gu Xiaomeng] reached into her coat and pulled out a handkerchief. She gently unfolded it to reveal a slightly crumpled cigarette inside. [Wang Tianxiang] reached out to take the cigarette, and [Gu Xiaomeng] calmed herself down a bit, reminiscing.
1:11:48|1:12:11|At the dining table yesterday, the cigarette was stepped on by [Gu Xiaomeng] with her heel. The sound of the door opening interrupted their conversation. Walking in was [Wu Tian] in military uniform. He strode forward, reached out to take the cigarette from [Wang Tianxiang], and then took out a magnifying glass from his pocket to carefully examine it.
1:12:11|1:12:19|There are several regular small holes on the cigarette. [Wu Tian] guessed with his sensitive professional sense.
1:12:27|1:12:42|In the gloomy execution room, [Wang Tianxiang] paced back and forth. He raised the cigarette. [Wu Zhiguo] had his shirt stripped off, with his hands and feet tied to the pillar.
1:12:45|1:12:55|He had just been tortured, covered in scars. [Wu Zhiguo] explained in a hoarse voice.
1:13:5|1:13:30|Surrounded by secret agents picking up weapons, getting ready to move forward. [Wang Tianxiang] raised his hand to stop them. The leading agent signaled and the electric shock passed through [Wu Zhiguo]'s body. He was in extreme pain, his muscles uncontrollably twitching under the voltage. The agent intensified the shaking even more.
1:13:41|1:13:59|[Wu Zhiguo]’s body continued to convulse uncontrollably. [Wu Zhiguo] kept his head down, gritting his teeth and gasping for breath. The high-intensity electric shock left him with a vacant stare.
1:14:10|1:14:31|The spy stepped forward to untie [Wu Zhiguo]. Just as the belts around his neck and hands were loosened, he collapsed. Chinese characters slowly appeared on the textured fabric: Whether the information has been leaked, success or failure lies in today. The writing slowly disappeared. Inside the room, [Gu Xiaomeng] who was mending clothes, cut the thread with scissors.
1:14:31|1:14:46|Reorganizing the plot, connecting the dots. Two black-clad secret agents downstairs were let through by the guards. When the haggard [Li Ningyu] saw this from the window, she couldn't help but hide in fear. She called out [Gu Xiaomeng]'s name with a vacant look in her eyes.
1:14:46|1:14:55|Turning around and looking at Gu Xiaomeng, who had put down the work in his hands. She walked over lightly, squatted down beside Gu Xiaomeng, and looked at him with empty eyes.
1:15:13|1:15:37|With a vacant look in her eyes, [Li Ningyu] reached out and embraced [Gu Xiaomeng]'s neck, whispering softly in her ear. The two, as close as sisters, leaned their heads together with calm expressions. [Li Ningyu] slowly moved her head away from [Gu Xiaomeng]'s shoulder. [Gu Xiaomeng] lowered her gaze, seemingly oblivious to everything.
1:15:37|1:15:53|[Li Ningyu] looked at [Gu Xiaomeng] with lifeless eyes. [Gu Xiaomeng] draped the mended cheongsam over [Li Ningyu]. [Li Ningyu] stood up, and she squatted down to help [Li Ningyu] button up. [Li Ningyu] looked down at her, and she met [Li Ningyu]'s gaze.
1:15:53|1:16:16|[Gu Xiaomeng] thought for a moment and pointed under the table. [Li Ningyu] slowly bent down and looked under the table. With a quick glance, she saw a round small electronic bug stuck to the bottom of the coffee table. [Gu Xiaomeng] quickly walked to the corner cabinet. She opened a drawer, took out some tape, and tore off a piece casually.
1:16:16|1:16:30|Placing a bug on the bookshelf. Then quickly walking over to stick tape on the bug under the coffee table. [Gu Xiaomeng] has no intention of stopping. Under the gaze of [Li Ningyu], she walks to a nearby table and tapes another bug.
1:16:31|1:16:47|Then, she casually picked up the cigarette on the table and waved towards [Li Ningyu]. [Gu Xiaomeng] walked to the bathroom, seeing [Li Ningyu] still standing there, she waved again to signal her to come over. [Gu Xiaomeng] entered the bathroom, while [Li Ningyu] watched her figure vigilantly.
1:16:47|1:17:0|In the bathroom, [Gu Xiaomeng] paced back and forth. When [Li Ningyu] walked in, she gently closed the door, took out a cigarette and lit it. [Li Ningyu] looked around, while [Gu Xiaomeng] leaned against the door frame, watching [Li Ningyu].
1:17:2|1:17:10|After speaking, she took out a lighter and lit a cigarette for herself. [Li Ningyu] slowly turned her head and approached [Gu Xiaomeng]. When she got close, she said.
1:17:12|1:17:18|[Li Ningyu]'s hollow eyes became unusually determined. The smoke wafted in the small bathroom.
1:17:20|1:17:30|All of this was beyond Gu Xiaomeng's expectations. She stood there in a daze, even forgetting to smoke. The wise may have a thousand thoughts, but at this moment, Gu Xiaomeng smiled.
1:17:34|1:17:45|In the prison cell, a soldier opens the door and invites [Gu Xiaomeng] in. [Gu Xiaomeng] enters with a smile, hunched over and holding a box. A group of secret agents surround a table, where a muscular man lying half-naked is [Wu Zhiguo].
1:17:53|1:18:9|[Gu Xiaomeng] ran to a small table on the side with a big smile on her face, opened the box. [Wu Zhiguo] tried to struggle, but was firmly held down by the secret agent. [Gu Xiaomeng] carefully selected potions and silver needles from the box.
1:18:36|1:18:43|[Gu Xiaomeng] pulled out the bottle stopper, inserted the selected silver needle into her finger, and gently stirred.
1:18:46|1:19:5|[Gu Xiaomeng] approached [Wu Zhiguo] with a silver needle, which she then forcefully inserted into a pressure point on [Wu Zhiguo]'s ankle. As [Gu Xiaomeng] lightly twisted the silver needle with her fingertips, [Wu Zhiguo] widened his eyes, clenched his teeth, and his eye sockets became extremely bloodshot with pain. [Wang Tianxiang] stepped forward to interrogate.
1:19:7|1:19:12|[Wu Zhiguo] had a frozen expression, with his whole head gently twitching.
1:19:13|1:19:32|[Gu Xiaomeng] ran her fingers over the silver needles and selected one as fine as a strand of hair. She lightly dipped it into a small bottle of medicine and then inserted it into his waist. [Wu Zhiguo]'s eye sockets began to bleed, and his mouth involuntarily twitched with composure.
1:19:34|1:19:49|[Gu Xiaomeng] gently twirled the silver needle. On the other side, in the bathroom, [Li Ningyu] stared intently at [Gu Xiaomeng]. [Gu Xiaomeng] nodded slightly, and [Li Ningyu] moved closer.
1:19:50|1:20:6|[Li Ningyu] said with red eyes full of disgust and resentment. [Gu Xiaomeng] lightly flicked the cigarette, waiting for [Li Ningyu] to continue. [Li Ningyu] then relaxed her expression and looked at her familiar colleague. [Gu Xiaomeng] took a puff of the cigarette.
1:20:8|1:20:15|[Gu Xiaomeng] licked her lips, took a deep breath, and said somewhat helplessly.
1:20:27|1:20:45|[Gu Xiaomeng] said sincerely. [Li Ningyu] slapped her crisply across the face. [Gu Xiaomeng] lowered her head slowly as [Li Ningyu] pushed her against the wall.
1:20:48|1:21:2|She pressed against [Gu Xiaomeng]'s face and questioned. Desperately, she pushed [Gu Xiaomeng] again. The betrayed [Li Ningyu] pulled open the bathroom door.
1:21:18|1:21:31|[Li Ningyu] was in extreme conflict, standing in place on the verge of going crazy. Meanwhile, [Gu Xiaomeng] stood at the door, smiling at her. Before long, she couldn't help but burst into tears as well.
1:22:4|1:22:33|The two sat on the edge of the bed, finally baring their hearts. Their intimacy was divided by their positions, and tears flowed freely down their two beautiful faces. In the execution room, another silver needle turned and pierced the blue veins in Wu Zhiguo's temple. He could hardly keep his eyes open, and the bloodstains on his eyes, ears, mouth, and nose confirmed the toughness of this man.
1:22:34|1:23:5|He grinned and closed his eyes. [Wang Tianxiang] approached him, while [Wu Zhiguo] continued to taunt him. [Wang Tianxiang] looked angrily at Lord Liu, who quickly stepped forward to probe [Wu Zhiguo] and stabbed another needle into his chest. The veins on [Wu Zhiguo]'s neck and forehead bulged, he held his breath, raised his body, and spat out blood.
1:23:7|1:23:24|Here, [Li Ningyu] is tearfully persuading [Gu Xiaomeng]. [Gu Xiaomeng] feels guilty and continues, "It's not easy to obtain intelligence with the heavily guarded Qiu Village."
1:23:34|1:23:40|[Li Ningyu] pulled [Gu Xiaomeng] up and asked, with his arm around her neck.
1:23:48|1:23:57|[Gu Xiaomeng] watched as the person who was like a sister to her was filled with tears, and tears fell from her own eyes as well. As she spoke, [Li Ningyu] tightly held [Gu Xiaomeng]'s hand.
1:23:58|1:24:12|[Gu Xiaomeng] forced a smile and gently embraced [Li Ningyu]. The pain of parting made it impossible for her to even fake a smile.
1:24:28|1:24:52|[Li Ningyu] pursed her lips tightly and shook her head gently. Meanwhile, in the execution room, [Wu Zhiguo] lay motionless on the ground. Uncle Liu went forward to inspect his condition and then reported back. He lowered his head and continued to speak while looking at [Wu Zhiguo].
1:24:56|1:25:10|Uncle Liu was left speechless by the question. After a moment of reaction, he swallowed his saliva, squatted down, and stared at [Wu Zhiguo]'s head for a while. He pointed to the Baihui acupoint with his finger, then gave a questioning look. [Wang Tianxiang] nodded with narrowed eyes.
1:25:10|1:25:30|Uncle Liu held a thin needle dipped in medicine, gently leaned down, slowly adjusted the angle, and found the acupoint accurately. This position had not been tried by him for a long time. Uncle Liu gently pushed aside Wu Zhiguo's hair, and Wang Tianxiang also leaned in to watch. A voice came from outside the door.
1:25:33|1:25:44|Uncle Liu and [Wang Tianxiang] both turned their heads. The soldier opened the iron gate, and approaching was [Li Ningyu]. She looked dull, with heavy steps, while [Wang Tianxiang] smoked, walking towards her with some confusion.
1:25:44|1:26:6|[Li Ningyu] took a step forward and raised her hand, holding a crumpled cigarette box in her palm. She slowly opened her palm and said, with a hint of tears in her voice, handing the cigarette box to [Wang Tianxiang]. [Wang Tianxiang] carefully examined the cigarette box, realizing that it was from Battery Three.
1:26:6|1:26:22|In the hospital, a nurse is pushing a stretcher, and the person lying on it is the wrongly accused [Wu Zhiguo]. With the combined effort of medical staff, the stretcher is quickly pushed into the operating room. The secret agent closes the door of the operating room and stands guard outside.
1:26:22|1:26:30|The doctor and nurse gently moved [Wu Zhiguo] from the stretcher to the operating table, then quickly put on gloves and prepared surgical supplies.
1:26:32|1:26:50|Doctors pulled out the silver needles from the ankle, chest, waist, and finally the temple of [Wu Zhiguo]. With the combined effort of the doctors, [Wu Zhiguo] was turned over. A doctor used tweezers to pull out the bent silver needle from [Wu Zhiguo]'s back.
1:26:50|1:27:1|Blood spurted out of the needle hole like a small fountain. Half-conscious [Wu Zhiguo] hummed a little tune.
1:27:35|1:28:4|The salty sea breeze blew through the Qiu Zhuang building. In the gloomy underground execution room, the spy was using an iron brush to roughen the coarse hemp rope hanging, while [Gu Xiaomeng], with her body barely covered by clothes, sat against the wall. A ladle of cold water was poured over her head, wetting her hair and covering her pretty face.
1:28:15|1:28:27|[Wang Tianxiang] grabbed [Gu Xiaomeng]'s hair and lifted her up. [Gu Xiaomeng] was gasping heavily, her consciousness blurred and she couldn't control her body, swaying as others pulled her.
1:28:32|1:28:40|Wang Tianxiang, in a fit of anger, pushed Gu Xiaomeng away.
1:28:41|1:28:56|The agent stepped forward to support [Gu Xiaomeng], propping her up next to a thick hemp rope. They spread [Gu Xiaomeng]'s legs apart and helped her ride on the roughly polished hemp rope, pushing her forward to rub against it. [Gu Xiaomeng]'s lower body suffered a heavy blow.
1:28:58|1:29:13|The spy pushed her back to slide again. This is a cruel and inhumane punishment for women, the rope torture. [Wu Tian] also arrived at the execution room at this time. The hanging hemp rope was dripping with blood, and [Wang Tianxiang] looked at it with lingering fear.
1:29:14|1:29:33|[Wu Tian] pulled the tablecloth, scattering objects all over the table. He gently covered the groaning [Gu Xiaomeng], who was already like a frightened bird, with the tablecloth. [Gu Xiaomeng], holding her lower body, moved back to hide.
1:29:39|1:29:46|In a dim interrogation room, the clock points to 8:30. [Gu Xiaomeng], who has changed clothes, leans against the chair with disheveled hair.
1:29:47|1:29:58|Her hands were handcuffed behind the chair. She licked her dry lips, while Wu Tian's words fell on deaf ears.
1:30:11|1:30:24|With a pale complexion and clear eyes, [Gu Xiaomeng] looked up at [Wu Tian]. [Wu Tian] gazed at her expectantly, eager to obtain information.
1:30:34|1:30:56|[Gu Xiaomeng] kept talking, the smile on her face growing wider. [Wu Tian] looked down from above, his eyes staring fiercely at the prisoner below. He took a deep breath, turned his back, pulled out a cigarette, then turned back and lit it. He struck the match gently.
1:31:4|1:31:18|[Gu Xiaomeng] glared angrily at [Wu Tian]. A sense of foreboding rose in [Gu Xiaomeng]'s heart.
1:31:21|1:31:28|Wu Tian listened for a while before putting down the earpiece, then looked at the clock.
1:31:39|1:31:48|Struggling on the chair, [Gu Xiaomeng] is firmly held down by the secret agent. [Wu Tian] puts the earpiece to [Gu Xiaomeng]'s ear.
1:31:58|1:32:27|[Gu Xiaomeng] had her hair disheveled, lowered her head and cried softly. [Wu Tian] waited for her answer. [Gu Xiaomeng] nodded repeatedly. [Wu Tian] put down the gun leaning against her head and picked up the microphone.
1:32:34|1:33:0|Wu Tian handed the receiver to his subordinate after speaking, then also switched off the safety of his pistol. Gu Xiaomeng adjusted her emotions and straightened her posture. Wu Tian also walked to her front, waiting for her confession.
1:33:1|1:33:21|She thought for a moment and continued. [Gu Xiaomeng] did not refuse, but also made a request.
1:33:26|1:33:31|Immediately, [Wu Tian] gave a glance to the nearby secret agent, who then turned around and left.
1:33:34|1:33:41|[Wu Tian] looked coldly at [Gu Xiaomeng], who lowered her eyes and shook her head as she gazed at the ground.
1:33:58|1:34:15|[Gu Xiaomeng] pulled out the thin needles tied behind her back and tried to unlock the handcuffs. [Wu Tian] glared at [Gu Xiaomeng] angrily.
1:34:16|1:34:33|At the same time, the commander limped back to the building. The commander, followed by his bodyguards, strode into the room. [Wang Tianxiang] stood up to greet him. [Wang Tianxiang] stood silently, which angered the commander.
1:34:34|1:34:45|At this moment, [Gu Xiaomeng] in the interrogation room is trying to pick the handcuffs with a needle. [Wu Tian], with his back to her, is smoking in resignation.
1:34:47|1:34:52|[Gu Xiaomeng] took the opportunity to provoke [Wu Tian].
1:34:57|1:35:10|[Wu Tian] looked at [Gu Xiaomeng] with interest. He took the cigarette from his mouth, leaned close to [Gu Xiaomeng]'s face, and smiled as he spoke.
1:35:14|1:35:41|[Wu Tian] also realized [Gu Xiaomeng]'s intention of provocation. While attracting [Wu Tian]'s attention, [Gu Xiaomeng] quietly opened the handcuffs. [Wu Tian] became angry and laughed sarcastically, grabbing [Gu Xiaomeng]'s neck.
1:35:42|1:36:6|[Gu Xiaomeng] wrapped her hands around [Wu Tian]'s neck and bit his ear. As [Wang Tianxiang] rushed in, she had already pulled the trigger, and the wounded [Gu Xiaomeng] slid down from [Wu Tian] and fell onto the cold floor. [Wang Tianxiang] and the commander looked at [Gu Xiaomeng] lying in a pool of blood.
1:36:14|1:36:26|At this moment, those present felt the determination of the Communist Party. [Wu Tian] let out a helpless roar, while [Gu Xiaomeng] closed her eyes.
1:36:27|1:36:41|A Communist Party member with a strong belief, in the face of confidential information and life, she resolutely chose to sacrifice the latter, to protect her team members, and to preserve the strength of the organization. The devilish interrogation meeting in Qiu Zhuang thus came to an end.
1:36:41|1:36:58|In the interrogation room, [Wu Tian] sat in the interrogation chair smoking. The commander, wearing a military coat and leaning on a cane, walked slowly towards [Wu Tian] and only then began to speak.
1:36:59|1:37:16|The gloomy [Wu Tian] lowered his head and took a drag of his cigarette, then said slowly. He looked at the commander with determination in his eyes.
1:37:17|1:37:27|Wang Tianxiang on the side listened thoughtfully. The commander spoke.
1:37:38|1:37:54|Wang Tianxiang on the side felt nervous when he heard this. He tentatively said, Wang Tianxiang suspected that he might be the scapegoat.
1:38:0|1:38:16|Under the brim of a hat, Commander stared fiercely at [Wang Tianxiang] as he left. Suddenly, the Commander pulled out a gun, but [Wang Tianxiang] saw the reflection in the mirror and narrowly escaped. He then grabbed a steel pipe and rushed forward, pressing the Commander against the wall.
1:38:26|1:38:46|Wang Tianxiang was shot dead, and his body slowly slid down against the commander. The one who fired the gun was Wu Tian. The commander leaning against the wall was still in shock, slowly walking out from the corner. Wu Tian slowly lowered his raised arm, and the commander looked down at Wang Tianxiang on the ground.
1:38:57|1:39:6|On a snowy night, cars turned at the intersection and lined up in front of [Baicaotang]. The snow was heavy and urgent.
1:39:7|1:39:24|The eaves and roof of the house are covered with white snow. A group of senior Japanese officers walk towards the [Baicaotang] in a big stride. Inside the [Baicaotang], Japanese soldiers stand in formation, with shiny steel guns waiting for the Communist Party members. And on the car outside the [Baicaotang],
1:39:24|1:39:41|The commander sat in the back seat staring at the door, while [Wu Tian] sat in the front row. Snowflakes fell outside the window. Tonight was their last chance. The next morning, the car was covered in thick snow, and a vendor was pushing a cart through the deep snow.
1:39:46|1:40:5|Pedestrians began to appear on the street. The commander, who was sleeping in the car with his hat askew, suddenly opened his eyes. He looked out of the windows on both sides and saw a merchant leading a camel passing by. The commander turned to look at [Wu Tian] in the front seat, knowing that their only chance to salvage the plan had failed.
1:40:5|1:40:25|At this moment, the sound of singing came from the street, and [Wu Tian] had already fallen asleep. Fast forward three months later, the road on the rain-soaked dock was muddy, and the reinforcements of the Japanese army marched in line with their guns. Thunder rumbled in the sky as the officer commanded the troops to move forward.
1:40:25|1:40:41|A military truck drives through a muddy dock. It stops at a small warehouse and opens the railing. Among the senior officers getting off the truck is [Wu Tian].
1:40:42|1:40:59|On the side, the Japanese reinforcements left, making room for the senior officers. The officers who were sent back to Japan crowded forward to sign, while [Wu Tian], with iron chains around his wrists, walked around to the other side of the eaves. He reached into his pocket and took out a pack of cigarettes, then sat on a wooden box under the eaves. In the crowd,
1:40:59|1:41:6|A figure with a military backpack on his back and wearing a raincoat walks in. His steps are very firm.
1:41:7|1:41:20|Passing by [Wu Tian], he gave him a deliberate glance, took a puff of the cigarette, and sat down next to [Wu Tian]. Without hesitation, [Wu Tian] took the cigarette he had lit, lit his own, and then returned the cigarette to the other party after finishing.
1:41:21|1:41:30|The two of them sat under the eaves, sheltering from the rain. [Wu Tian] enjoyed taking a few puffs of his cigarette and also opened up the conversation.
1:41:38|1:41:48|And the man just kept smoking by himself, never answering [Wu Tian]. Wu Tian didn't care at all, continuing to smoke.
1:41:50|1:42:5|He exhaled smoke, glanced at the soldiers beside him, and sneered. Wu Tian looked at the rain with a complex expression, took a deep breath and said.
1:42:12|1:42:32|Speaking of this, Wu Tian couldn't help but smile. He lowered his head to take a puff of his cigarette, and the soldier next to him finished smoking as well. The sound of the steamboat's whistle could be heard. The soldier patted Wu Tian's shoulder and said. Wu Tian had just raised his head when he was pressed down, and a small knife quickly slashed across Wu Tian's trachea.
1:42:33|1:42:46|[Wu Tian] looked up with wide eyes. The soldier was none other than the miraculously survived [Wu Zhiguo]. [Wu Zhiguo] covered the wound on his neck with his collar and walked into the rain with a hood on.
1:42:46|1:43:7|Wu Tian's body slowly knelt uncontrollably, then blood sprayed from his neck as he fell backwards onto the muddy ground. On the rainy dock, not far away was the ship that could take him home. Soon after, the Japanese army announced their surrender. The wide streets were crowded with people celebrating this historic moment.
1:43:7|1:43:23|On the street, a Japanese military officer passes by in a car, and the people cheer and dance happily, expressing their joy in their own way. In the new era toilet paper factory, banners with the words "Work hard to produce" and "Comfort the national army" are hung up.
1:43:23|1:43:44|The workshop director led the well-dressed [Wu Zhiguo] over. They arrived at a production line, where the director leaned in and shouted. As the director approached, [Li Ningyu] finally turned around and was stunned to see [Wu Zhiguo] right there.
1:43:44|1:43:51|On the street, [Li Ningyu] and [Wu Zhiguo] walked, with [Li Ningyu] looking pale and despondent.
1:43:58|1:44:7|The two sat facing each other in a coffee shop, [Wu Zhiguo] picked up the cup and took a sip of coffee.
1:44:24|1:44:38|[Li Ningyu] also picked up the cup and took a sip, while [Wu Zhiguo] lit a cigarette for himself. [Li Ningyu] felt a bit puzzled.
1:44:39|1:44:47|[Li Ningyu] still doesn't understand what's so attractive about women's cheongsams.
1:45:1|1:45:8|[Wu Zhiguo] took a puff of his cigarette. While [Li Ningyu] across from him furrowed her brows, trying hard to recall what happened that night.
1:45:18|1:45:29|After Wu Zhiguo's explanation, Li Ningyu looked thoughtfully at the coffee cup. The brief and painful days in Qiu Zhuang made her unforgettable for a lifetime. Li Ningyu supported her forehead, lost in thought.
1:45:29|1:45:37|That night, [Wu Zhiguo] burst into [Gu Xiaomeng]'s room. [Wu Zhiguo] frowned and stared at [Gu Xiaomeng], then smiled slightly.
1:45:42|1:45:48|He reached out to touch the bugs around him. At that moment, [Wang Tianxiang] had just tapped into the signal in [Gu Xiaomeng]'s room.
1:45:49|1:45:56|[Gu Xiaomeng] pretended not to appreciate it, [Wu Zhiguo] pointed at his ear and pushed [Gu Xiaomeng] down.
1:45:58|1:46:5|[Wu Zhiguo] taped the bug under the table with adhesive tape.
1:46:43|1:46:53|Outside came the sound of footsteps, indicating that time was running out for them. [Wu Zhiguo] pulled open [Gu Xiaomeng]'s collar, and she realized that this comrade was more considerate than her in handling things.
1:46:53|1:47:2|[Wu Zhiguo] walked while messing up his own clothes. [Gu Xiaomeng] understood the meaning behind it, and went to the mirror to mess up her hair, pretending to be bullied by [Wu Zhiguo].
1:47:24|1:47:41|After [Li Ningyu] was taken away for interrogation, the room was left with only [Gu Xiaomeng], [Wu Zhiguo], and two corpses. [Wu Zhiguo] walked gently to [Gu Xiaomeng], grabbed her hand, and wrote in her palm: If no information is leaked tonight, the organization will be destroyed. I will take the blame.
1:47:41|1:47:56|In the end, [Wu Zhiguo] reached into his pocket and took out a cigarette, the Three Cannon Tower that [Wang Tianxiang] had been eyeing from behind. He placed the cigarette in [Gu Xiaomeng]'s hand and helped her grip it. With tears in her eyes, [Gu Xiaomeng] shook her head gently as tears welled up in her eyes.
1:47:56|1:48:13|Later, [Gu Xiaomeng] wrote on [Wu Zhiguo]'s hand: "You must stay alive and find a way to get the message out." [Wu Zhiguo] shook his head and wrote: "I am the old gun, I order you to report me." [Gu Xiaomeng] pursed her lips, tears welling up in her eyes, looking at this comrade who was both familiar and unfamiliar.
1:48:13|1:48:21|The two held each other's hands tightly, looking at each other with determined eyes. This was the organization's last hope, to either succeed or meet their end.
1:48:22|1:48:40|[Gu Xiaomeng] looked at [Wu Zhiguo], pondered for a moment, and wrote on his palm: "You have to hold on, I have a way." [Wu Zhiguo] furrowed his brows into a Sichuan character. [Gu Xiaomeng] adjusted her emotions, preventing tears from falling, and then calmly said, [Wu Zhiguo] had to act with her.
1:48:54|1:49:0|In the café, [Wu Zhiguo] smoked a cigarette and poured out his inner thoughts at that time.
1:49:6|1:49:26|[Wu Zhiguo] took another drag on his cigarette as he recalled. At that time, the doctor moved him onto the operating table. The length of the singing indicated Morse code. A nurse in the operating room listened while lightly tapping her fingers, translating it to reveal: The intelligence is false, do not take action.
1:49:27|1:49:35|Understanding the meaning, the nurse quickly walked out of the operating room. And so, [Wu Zhiguo] sent out the intelligence in a life-threatening manner.
1:49:38|1:49:45|In the coffee shop, [Li Ningyu] asked again in confusion.
1:49:49|1:50:5|[Wu Zhiguo] pondered for a moment, remaining silent. He took a deep drag of his cigarette and began recounting [Gu Xiaomeng]'s plan at the time. In the living room of Qiu Zhuang, [Gu Xiaomeng] held clothes in her arms and a needle in her hand, lost in thought.
1:50:11|1:50:36|The Chinese characters that appeared earlier in the net pattern turned out to be left by [Gu Xiaomeng]. The scene shifts to the moment when [Gu Xiaomeng] was shot, and through her coat, the net with bloodstains inside reveals the characters: The intelligence is false, do not take action, Old Ghost. The scene changes, and the covered [Gu Xiaomeng] is carried out of the house.
1:50:42|1:50:50|Back in the coffee shop, [Li Ningyu] was digesting the secrets. Shortly after, [Wu Zhiguo] arrived at her house with [Li Ningyu].
1:50:51|1:51:6|This is an old adobe house, far from the luxurious life of [Li Ningyu] back then. Now a worker, [Li Ningyu] takes out the key and unlocks the door. Inside, [Li Ningyu] steps on a chair to open the suitcase on top of the wardrobe, searching for a while before quickly finding the cheongsam from that time.
1:51:6|1:51:16|[Li Ningyu] hands the cheongsam to [Wu Zhiguo].
1:51:17|1:51:35|[Wu Zhiguo] found the seams of the cheongsam, holding [Li Ningyu]'s hand to feel each button. [Li Ningyu] gently kneaded and immediately put the cheongsam into her arms. She leaned in for a closer look, the intermittent and dense seams seemed to follow a certain pattern. [Li Ningyu] walked and looked, then slowly sat down.
1:51:35|1:51:42|The letter was made up of stitches of different lengths. Beside it, [Wu Zhiguo] added.
1:51:46|1:52:1|[Li Ningyu] was completely absorbed in it. The stitches seemed to turn into words in the air like magic. "Whether the information is leaked, success or failure will be known in the coming days." [Li Ningyu] understood every word left by her sister. The more she read, the more anxious she became, the more she wanted to know.
1:52:1|1:52:22|The younger sister who always calls herself "Jade Sister" has something on her mind. In this special letter, it is written: "I am not afraid of death, but afraid that those who love me do not know why I died. I am in purgatory, leaving this record, only hoping that my family and Jade Sister can forgive my decision at this moment." [Wu Zhiguo] looked at [Li Ningyu] with a heavy heart.
1:52:22|1:52:37|While [Li Ningyu] was flipping her qipao, tears were rolling down her face. She finally put down the qipao and held it gently. Trembling, she took out a cigarette, which she hadn't smoked for a long time, and [Wu Zhiguo] timely lit it for her.
1:52:37|1:52:56|Her lips trembled involuntarily. She held the cigarette with her hand, sucking on it eagerly like a drug addict who had finally found relief after a long drought. And his addiction in his heart was the deep longing for his best friend and his sister. Tears and snot flowed without reservation, but she was now both miserable and relieved.
1:52:56|1:53:3|This letter, this monologue now laid bare in front of oneself, is the heartfelt communication between the two sisters.
1:53:4|1:53:15|True sadness is when you can't cry out loud, only tears are streaming down. Back in the car, [Wu Zhiguo] looked solemn, his brows furrowed into a character for river. This man, a senior officer,
1:53:15|1:53:33|At the most critical moment, it was the strong and brave female comrade [Gu Xiaomeng], the leader of the organization, who stood up and protected him with her life, protecting the organization. [Wu Zhiguo], who had endured torture, a man of iron who never revealed a word, shed tears at this moment.
