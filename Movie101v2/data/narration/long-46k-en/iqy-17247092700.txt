0:0:45|0:1:9|On the screen, the People's Liberation Army of China marched in neat formation from a distance. In early 1947, after suffering heavy blows from our army on the national battlefield, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits changed their strategic deployment and launched a major offensive against our Northwest and East China liberation areas.
0:1:9|0:1:30|Our East China Army carried out Chairman Mao's strategic policy. PLA soldiers advanced forward using horses to transport supplies. The camera zooms out, showing a cavalry column galloping towards us, the long line extending all the way to the dusty horizon.
0:1:39|0:1:57|In the mass army retreat, men carried supplies on horses and single-wheeled carts, while women carried baskets and bundles, some holding children as they hurried forward. The scene shifted, and two soldiers carrying guns approached.
0:1:59|0:2:4|The squad leader turned his head to the left and saw a building destroyed by war standing on the side.
0:2:22|0:2:27|The two looked ahead, where there were layers of distant mountains. [Li Jing] turned to [Liu Yonggui].
0:2:34|0:2:37|The scene shifts, with Commander Gao and the instructor walking among the troops.
0:3:1|0:3:4|A soldier walked among the crowd, seeing the civilians leaving with their belongings, each looking dejected and exhausted.
0:3:32|0:3:52|An old man carrying a heavy burden on his back hands the child in his arms to a woman next to him. He looks into the distance, shakes his head, and sighs. The soldiers lower their heads upon seeing this, their expressions solemn. The camera then shifts to Commander Gao and the instructor.
0:3:52|0:3:59|The sound of military bugle rang out, and the two stopped in their tracks to look towards the sky behind them, where five planes were flying in a V formation closely following the troops.
0:4:2|0:4:7|The scene shifts, with [Commander Gao] and the soldiers hiding in the bunker, looking up as the plane flies overhead.
0:4:18|0:4:25|Commander Gao furrowed his brow, turned his head, used his hand to shield the sun from his forehead, and continued to observe the planes in the sky, while Captain Liu and the squad leader crouched in the shelter.
0:4:27|0:4:33|A soldier turns to [Platoon Leader], the scene changes. On the dusty road, a tank carrying soldiers drives in the middle of the road, while infantry troops march in formation on one side of the road.
0:4:56|0:5:16|The convoy billowed thick black smoke as it followed closely behind. Several soldiers from the back of the truck crossed in front of the vehicle and walked to the other side of the road, with the camera closely following the front car. Two Nationalist Army officers wearing military caps and coats listened to the radio inside the car.
0:5:43|0:5:45|The officer who took the map looked pensive.
0:5:50|0:5:53|He bent down to turn off the radio. The Chief of Staff nodded. Based on the combat experience in northern Jiangsu.
0:6:26|0:6:29|The Headmaster looked ahead with a contemptuous gaze.
0:6:44|0:7:1|Hearing the roar of a motorcycle, the Headmaster looked out the window. A soldier on a motorcycle stopped beside the car, holding a document and saluting. Commander Gao took the document, adjusting his glasses.
0:7:1|0:7:12|The Headmaster took the document, read it, threw it down, looking serious. The screen went black, then switched to a scene where a large group of PLA soldiers marched towards a river.
0:7:13|0:7:23|Commander Gao and two others walked alongside a group of soldiers carrying rifles. They stopped by the river and gazed across to the other side.
0:7:40|0:7:59|Three people turned around, [Commander Gao] and the instructor mounted their horses, the horses waded through the shallow water, and together with the soldiers, they walked towards the smoky opposite bank. An old woman with her hair in a bun and wearing a mandarin jacket stood at the village entrance, her hands clasped in front of her, gazing across the river in a trance.
0:8:12|0:8:15|[Zhao Yumin] took the child and held him in her arms.
0:8:20|0:8:26|[Zhao Yumin] turned around, and a young soldier stood in front of her with a smile, as [Commander Gao] approached.
0:9:9|0:9:27|The two looked down the slope to the riverbank, where the village head [Zhao Yumin], with neat short hair, was pushing a cart with the villagers crossing the river. [Zhao Yumin] looked up and a woman approached, followed by a girl in a floral jacket.
0:9:36|0:9:40|Commander Gao turned to Zhao Yumin with a smile.
0:9:59|0:10:2|Commander Gao walked forward with [Zhao Yumin], while the old lady looked puzzled.
0:10:29|0:10:32|Commander Gao looks solemnly into the distance.
0:10:56|0:11:2|A soldier walked out of the team, walked up to [Commander Gao], and saluted.
0:11:26|0:11:43|The soldier saluted and then walked back to the main force. He merged into the advancing troops. Another soldier rode up on a horse and stopped in front of [Commander Gao].
0:11:55|0:12:5|A soldier blows the military bugle, and the large troop stops moving forward. The soldiers turn around in confusion, looking at each other.
0:12:5|0:12:20|The screen goes black, then the scene changes. Night falls, and the People's Liberation Army troops rest in a small grove. Soldiers lean against tree trunks, sitting in groups of two or three. Some have lit fires for warmth and light, some are repairing guns or shoes, and some are smoking with their heads bowed.
0:12:32|0:12:40|Li Jing and soldier Wang Chun sat together, Li Jing was cleaning her shoes while Wang Chun sighed with his hands in his pockets.
0:13:2|0:13:7|Huang Chun glared angrily at [Li Jin]. [Li Jin] stood up, straightened his clothes, and walked towards the back.
0:13:30|0:13:38|The scene shifts to a villager carrying a small lantern, bringing a bag of rice into the courtyard. The villagers are bustling in the courtyard, and [Madam Yonggui] bursts into laughter.
0:14:5|0:14:7|At this moment, the village chief [Zhao Yumin] and a soldier walked over, talking. [Zhao Yumin] approached [Erman].
0:14:51|0:14:53|[Yonggui's wife] looks awkward.
0:15:9|0:15:25|Captain Liu lowered his head and remained silent, helplessly avoiding eye contact. Zhao Yumin didn't know what to say for a moment, when a soldier approached from behind. Zhao Yumin looked around again, picked up the lantern, and followed the young soldier.
0:15:28|0:15:30|The scene cuts to a close-up, with [Zhao Yumin] and [Commander Gao] sitting together.
0:15:40|0:15:46|Commander Gao picked up a cigarette from the table, put it in his mouth, and the young soldier poured a glass of water for Zhao Yumin.
0:15:47|0:15:49|[Zhao Yumin] smiled and put down the notebook in her hand.
0:15:59|0:16:1|[Zhao Yumin] picked up the cup and took a sip of water, then walked to the door and took the kerosene lamp handed to her by the young soldier.
0:16:34|0:16:43|[Zhao Yumin] and the young soldiers left together. The scene changes to the night, where two PLA officers are walking past the soldiers' camp.
0:17:9|0:17:30|Inside the room, the PLA officers sat around for a meeting. Most comrades were eager for battle. Captain Zhang scooped up a bowl of water from the charcoal and took a sip.
0:17:33|0:17:44|The instructor took the challenge letter and handed it to [Captain]. [Captain] lit a cigarette, lowered his head, and read the challenge letter with a frown.
0:17:56|0:18:22|[Lieutenant] sighed heavily and sat down again. The instructor and squad leader sat on the other side of the table, watching [Lieutenant]. The squad leader hesitated for a moment. [Lieutenant] angrily slammed the table and then sighed helplessly. He turned around with his hands behind his back, pacing back and forth in the room.
0:18:26|0:18:53|After a while, he looked around and asked, "Why is everyone silent?" Captain Zhang turned and left, the instructor helplessly looked at the squad leader. The scene shifted to the camp, looking down from the high ground, with flickering lights in the woods. Villagers carrying lanterns walked on the main road, [Commander Gao] and Captain Zhang approached, standing on the high ground.
0:18:55|0:19:3|The two walked forward and found a place to sit down. The platoon leader turned to [Commander Gao] and said.
0:19:20|0:19:29|In the training ground, there must be many soldiers looking worried. The platoon leader furrows his brow and blinks constantly, lost in thought.
0:21:25|0:21:31|The Headmaster is holding a meeting for the cadres. The Headmaster is pointing at the strategic map behind him. The cadres are taking notes attentively.
0:21:56|0:22:1|The atmosphere in the room was solemn as the [Headmaster] walked up to the table and looked at the map on it.
0:23:32|0:23:37|[Headmaster] is lost in thought, looking serious.
0:23:48|0:23:50|He continued pointing at the strategic map.
0:23:54|0:23:56|The [Headmaster] stood up straight, with a smile on his face.
0:25:2|0:25:15|The Headmaster made a gesture of encirclement on the map and looked at everyone. The cadres also smiled and nodded, and the Headmaster sat down.
0:25:22|0:25:25|Political Commissar Shi stood up and faced everyone.
0:25:51|0:25:55|The cadres smiled at each other, [Shi Zhengwei] sat down, and a guard brought a document to [Headmaster].
0:26:19|0:26:31|The Headmaster signed on the document, picked up a piece of paper, carefully read the content on it, and handed it to Shi Zhengwei.
0:26:38|0:26:43|The Headmaster looks serious and turns to a cadre sitting beside him.
0:26:48|0:26:51|The cadre stood up, saluted the [Headmaster] and [Shi Zhengwei], then turned and left. The scene shifted, showing [Commander Gao] and two others.
0:27:19|0:27:39|[Commander Gao] put away his pen. The signalman walked into the room. The three turned around, the scene shifted, and the soldiers picked up their belongings, gathering in the same direction. [Commander Gao] and the political instructor hurried over, intending to intercept them head-on.
0:27:47|0:28:9|Three of them left separately, and the scene shifted to heavy guards stationed at the Kuomintang stronghold. The room was luxuriously decorated, with officers sitting around the table dining. Some people were moving around in the room, while the officers at the table were discussing military affairs. [Commander Zhang] tapped the salt shaker and stood up.
0:28:38|0:28:44|Taocun is the gateway to Shandong, the outpost in front of Yimeng Mountain. [Captain Li] scanned the crowd, looking at the officer smoking on the side, and slowly stood up.
0:30:12|0:30:17|[Commander Zhang] stood up impulsively. Two officers in the audience glanced at each other and shook their heads slightly.
0:30:39|0:30:47|[Colonel Li] showed a look of anger and helplessness, sighed. [Headmaster] looked around at everyone.
0:30:58|0:31:2|General Zhang stared intently at the speaking Headmaster.
0:31:10|0:31:15|The [Headmaster] turned around and walked towards the strategic map at the back, pointing at the map as he spoke.
0:31:33|0:31:41|The instructor put down the paper pointer in his hand and walked back to the table, looking at the officer beside him.
0:31:58|0:32:24|[Headmaster] sat back in his seat. Commander Zhang beside him watched him, Commander Li scratched his head, sighed, and Commander Zhang sneered. The General tapped on the plate, read through the document delivered by the messenger, frowned, and set it aside.
0:32:56|0:32:58|Colonel Li also stood up. The General stood up holding a file.
0:33:46|0:33:55|The scene shifts, officers walk down the spiral staircase outside the banquet hall. Commander Zhang and Commander Li are talking. Commander Zhang speaks first.
0:34:11|0:34:20|Captain Liu and Commander Gao saluted each other and shook hands before parting ways. Captain Liu then turned and got into the small sedan, followed by the security guard. The sedan slowly drove away.
0:34:23|0:34:43|The scene shifts, two Kuomintang soldiers are rapidly operating the handles of a cannon, raising the barrel. A row of tanks fires shells, smoke fills the battlefield. A large number of Kuomintang soldiers run across the river bank, charging towards the People's Liberation Army's defensive assault. Three PLA soldiers lie behind cover, reloading bullets into the chamber.
0:34:43|0:34:52|More Kuomintang soldiers waded through the water under the artillery fire. The PLA soldiers fiercely shot from behind cover, hitting the advancing enemies.
0:34:53|0:34:58|Nationalist shells also fell behind the People's Liberation Army's cover, stirring up a cloud of dust.
0:35:4|0:35:19|A high-ranking soldier of the People's Liberation Army, holding a machine gun, fiercely firing, leading the charge as the Nationalist soldiers in front fall one after another. Soldiers behind them take over and charge forward. Commander Gao throws grenades forward, and under the dual attack of bullets and grenades, more Nationalist soldiers fall on the river bank.
0:35:19|0:35:30|Captain Liu, the machine gunner, aimed the machine gun and kept firing, hitting the enemy soldiers charging ahead. The troops behind quickly caught up, bullets splashing up large patches of water in front of the enemy, causing more Nationalist soldiers to fall.
0:35:33|0:35:42|Commander Gao is observing the situation ahead. The guard is answering the phone.
0:36:9|0:36:12|Commander Gao rolled up his sleeves to check the time.
0:36:25|0:36:31|Commander Gao hung up the phone, turned around, picked up the binoculars and started observing the front line where the artillery fire was intense.
0:36:35|0:36:48|The instructor turned and left, the scene switched, and five days later appeared above the smoke-filled village with four big characters. Among several villagers carrying burdens, [Zhao Yumin] was helping a wounded soldier to walk slowly.
0:36:48|0:36:54|A soldier with a rifle on his back approached, [Zhao Yumin] carefully handed the wounded soldier over to him, while she stood in place, touched her head and wiped the sweat off.
0:36:58|0:37:13|[Zhao Yumin] caught up and the scene shifted, with many villagers carrying stretchers. [Zhao Yumin] adjusted the stretcher for one of the wounded on it. The villagers continued to move forward along the road with the stretchers. Villagers pushing carts and carrying shoulder poles with supplies walked in the middle of the road.
0:37:13|0:37:16|The Headmaster and Captain Liu walked with the guards following behind.
0:37:23|0:37:25|The two men and [Commander Gao] advance into the military forest.
0:37:31|0:37:44|The sound of gunfire rang out, and the three of them looked towards the front line. The mayor led the other two towards the observation area under the grass shed. The mayor glanced at his watch and then looked at [Commander Gao].
0:38:10|0:38:13|Commander Gao smiled bitterly.
0:39:6|0:39:9|The mayor smiled, and [Captain Liu] stepped forward.
0:39:26|0:39:45|Captain Liu turned his head and looked solemnly towards the front line. Under the cover of tanks, the Nationalist troops crossed the river bank and rushed towards the Communist forces. The gravel ground was filled with smoke, with occasional explosions of shells raising dust. More Nationalist soldiers followed behind several tanks, charging towards the Communist forces.
0:39:49|0:40:8|In the trenches of the People's Liberation Army, soldiers are holding the frontline. [Captain Liu] frowns as he aims the machine gun, bullets hitting the trench in front of another soldier. He remains calm and continues shooting. [Commander Gao] runs up to [Captain Liu], crouches down, and observes the frontline.
0:40:8|0:40:16|In the midst of the raging battlefield, with flames and smoke all around, the tanks of the Nationalist Army continued to advance under heavy fire. They fired shells while crossing over the earthworks.
0:40:17|0:40:37|Nationalist soldiers launched an assault under the cover of tanks. Commander Gao observed the front with a serious expression, while the tank continued to advance at full speed. Captain Liu began to fiercely spray bullets with a machine gun towards the opposite side, with the muzzle continuously ejecting bullets and gunpowder filling the air.
0:40:37|0:40:43|The machine gun rattled fiercely, as the soldiers stared intently at the enemy, causing many Nationalist soldiers to fall under the heavy fire.
0:40:45|0:40:50|PLA soldiers lay behind cover, pulling the trigger, causing more enemy soldiers to fall to the ground.
0:40:52|0:41:5|Behind the PLA sniper, several soldiers vigorously threw grenades, which exploded and sent a large number of enemy soldiers flying. The PLA defensive artillery fire showed no signs of weakening, and Li Jin also threw a grenade.
0:41:5|0:41:20|The People's Liberation Army soldier saw the tank forcefully pull the lever, causing the landmines around the tank to explode, halting its advance. Nationalist soldiers behind continued to cross the trench and charge forward. The PLA machine gun kept spitting out bullets, with many enemies in the front line raising their guns to counterattack.
0:41:23|0:41:38|The machine gunner of the People's Liberation Army reloaded despite being injured, and was supported to the side. The soldier next to him quickly took over his position, looking towards [Captain Zhang]. The soldier immediately started firing forward, with the enemy only a narrow ditch away. [Captain Zhang] exerted all his strength to throw a grenade forward, waving his hand fiercely.
0:41:40|0:42:0|The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are high-spirited, jumping out of their cover and charging towards the enemy. A soldier stands up on the cover, looks around, sees the soldiers charging down the hill, running across the trenches, bravely and fearlessly advancing towards the enemy. The enemy is caught off guard, retreats backwards, gradually falling into disarray.
0:42:0|0:42:11|Captain Zhang looked at [Commander Gao] through the machine gun in the middle. Captain Zhang looked surprised, angrily clenched his fist and turned his head away, then replied.
0:43:6|0:43:11|Commander Gao turns around. Commander Gao takes the gun. Zhao Yumin happily takes the gun and looks down at it.
0:43:39|0:44:1|The scene switches, with PLA soldiers lined up in a long queue, carrying guns, walking one after another on the road leaving the village. Villagers stand by, reluctant to watch them go. Zhao Yumin, seeing this scene, quickly walks up and stands on a small mound, addressing everyone.
0:44:19|0:44:29|Commander Gao and Zhao Yumin stand together. Zhao Yumin looks up at Commander Gao and touches his arm.
0:44:34|0:45:1|Commander Gao walked away with the guards, while Zhao Yumin stood in place, looking in the direction they left with a sinister anticipation in her eyes. Captain Liu walked up to his wife, gave her one last look, then turned to join the team, as Yonggui also turned and left.
0:45:2|0:45:23|A group of villagers bid farewell to the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, waving their guns and hands. The two groups departed in different directions. The villagers went up the mountain path while the PLA troops gradually moved away along the central road. Both groups waved goodbye reluctantly, each carrying out their respective tasks, looking forward to meeting again.
0:45:23|0:45:48|The scene shifts to the devastated battlefield where craters are scattered everywhere from the previous battles. The surviving trees stretch out their delicate branches. The land is desolate and silent. The remaining Nationalist soldiers raise their cannons and fire at the enemy. The shells continuously land behind the former positions of the People's Liberation Army, stirring up large clouds of dust.
0:45:48|0:45:54|The Nationalist Army soldiers, carrying rifles and cautiously wading through the river, landed in Taocun on the opposite bank.
0:45:55|0:46:19|The soldier running ahead with a gun stood at the entrance of the fleeing village, looking around to observe the situation of the village. They split into teams and entered the alleys to search. A team of soldiers crouched and approached a house, with the leading soldier kicking open the door and firing into the house.
0:46:19|0:46:43|A military vehicle stopped at the entrance of the village, and two Kuomintang officers got out of the car. A guard ran to the front of the car, and all the soldiers stood at attention. A soldier ran to the front of the car and saluted the two officers. The soldier led the way and ran off. [Zhao Yumin] took two steps forward with the chief of staff, then stood still.
0:46:43|0:46:49|He saw eight big characters on the wall across from him, saying "Our army will win, Jiang's army will lose."
0:46:56|0:47:17|The scene shifts to Nationalist soldiers looting supplies. One soldier finds nothing and is mocked by his comrades. Angered, he kicks a piece of wood, picks up his gun, and leaves. Another soldier runs up to two officers and hands a document to [Headmaster]. [Headmaster] nods silently and the soldier runs off.
0:47:17|0:47:22|The Chief of Staff opened the file for reading, then turned to Commander Zhang.
0:47:30|0:47:50|[Commander Zhang] was startled, his brows furrowed tightly. His eyes were in a panic, he lowered his head, then slapped his thigh, pacing back and forth in front of the car in agitation. The scene switched to continuous mountains, lush trees, and PLA soldiers marching in a line, passing through a rocky beach.
0:47:50|0:48:1|Some of them carry firearms on their backs, some carry tightly packed luggage, one after another climbing up the mountain. Chinese subtitle volunteer [Li Zongsheng].
0:48:3|0:48:22|[Li Jin] wiped the sweat off and caught up with the team in front. [Liu Yonggui] followed behind with a gun on his back, while the soldiers gasped for breath as they hurried along. A young soldier struggled to climb up a slope, exhausted, bending over to support his knees. His comrades came up from behind, took the gun off his back, and helped lighten his load.
0:48:22|0:48:31|The young soldier regained his spirits, caught up with the team, and continued climbing the mountain with determination. The rugged mountain path did not slow down the rapid pace of the People's Liberation Army's troop movement.
0:48:32|0:48:52|The scene shifts, with strong winds and pouring rain, but the troops continue to march forward resolutely. The soldiers maintain their posture and determination as they move ahead. Passing through a swiftly flowing river, their boots splash through the mud and water without anyone paying attention to their soaked shoes.
0:48:52|0:49:21|Despite the uneven ground underfoot and soaked clothing, despite traveling day and night and feeling physically exhausted, the soldiers still had determined eyes and maintained orderly formations. [Li Jin] carried his gun, rain beating down on his face. [Commander Gao] also braved the storm with the soldiers, all moving forward together.
0:49:21|0:49:28|The scene changes, a Kuomintang military truck drives through the soldiers honking its horn. The soldiers gather around from behind.
0:49:30|0:49:45|Inside a house in Taocun, smoke filled the air. Several Kuomintang officers were smoking, two were looking at a map, one was pacing back and forth, and two were chatting by a pillar.
0:50:17|0:50:28|On the side, the officer shook his head. [Headmaster] walked into the room, stood in front of the table looking at the map, and several officers gathered around. [Headmaster] glanced at them.
0:50:30|0:50:55|Several officers looked at each other and slowly walked away. The sound of a telegram came through, and the [Headmaster] looked towards the other side of the room. In the next room, two telegraph operators were sending telegrams. [Captain Liu] paced nervously, [Headmaster] walked in, his face serious, shook his head, and began to speak.
0:51:8|0:51:15|Captain Liu furrowed his brows, slowly turned around, and walked away in large strides. The Headmaster kept his head down.
0:51:20|0:51:57|Zhang [Headmaster] half reclined on the chair, with a table beside him holding a bottle of red wine. His hands were clasped in front of his chest, and he raised his face to take a deep breath. The Chief of Staff, holding a cigarette, walked up to him and lit it for him. Zhang [Headmaster] suddenly stood up, walked to the telegraph operator, and took the telegram. The two began to read it.
0:52:6|0:52:21|Zhang [Headmaster] showed a shocked expression, then quickly walked out of the room and went to the table in the next room, looking at the map. He used his finger to draw a line on the map from Taocun to Fenghuang Mountain, then looked up and said.
0:52:31|0:52:44|The scene shifts to a hillside where the People's Liberation Army troops are lined up, continuing along the winding mountain road. A cannon fires, and Li Jin stands on a rock looking in that direction.
0:52:45|0:52:59|He continued to walk with a smile, while [Commander Gao] observed the distance through binoculars. He pointed to the map on the ground where the guards were, and then pointed to the distance. Captain Zhang supported a soldier and climbed up the hill, looking into the distance.
0:53:9|0:53:13|The soldier took over Captain Zhang's gun and excitedly walked up to [Commander Gao].
0:53:21|0:53:25|Lieutenant Zhang turned around and climbed up the hill, walking to an old man with a headscarf.
0:54:1|0:54:26|The platoon leader excitedly picked up the binoculars, and the resting soldiers heard the number and stood up one after another, happily telling their comrades. Commander Gao looked at the map and walked to the team that had been resting all along.
0:54:29|0:54:49|Commander Gao followed behind Headmaster, climbed up the hill, and looked towards the direction of the battle. Taking the binoculars, Commander Gao looked through them and saw continuous artillery fire on several distant hills, with thick smoke rising from the terraced fields on the hillside.
0:56:6|0:56:19|Everyone laughed together, and Wang Chun suddenly stood up and pointed ahead. Everyone stood up and looked in the same direction, where a group of PLA soldiers were leading some captured Nationalist soldiers.
0:56:20|0:56:32|Everyone gathered around to watch, while another orderly team of PLA soldiers approached from another direction. They looked happily at the victory in front of them.
0:56:51|0:57:17|Li Jinsheng turned around in a huff and walked away, heading towards [Captain Zhang]. [Captain Zhang] walked away. Everyone looked at the back of [Captain Zhang] and started laughing. On the main road, the artillery unit returning from the fort was using vehicles to transport supplies.
0:57:20|0:57:25|A soldier walked to the roadside to borrow a lighter, looked up and saw [Zhao Yumin] and others.
0:57:49|0:57:59|He ran ahead of the advancing troops, while the infantry unit marched neatly behind. The scene then shifts to the command post, where the [Headmaster] is attentively listening to a phone call.
0:58:1|0:58:4|The Headmaster glanced at his watch and continued speaking.
0:58:10|0:58:14|The Headmaster put down the receiver and walked towards the Discipline Inspection Committee of the regiment.
0:58:54|0:59:12|The [Headmaster] signs on the document, while a company and a platoon are resting in the woods. Captain Zhang sits on a rock frowning and smoking, everyone gets up and runs towards the commander, [Commander Gao] dismounts and walks over.
0:59:32|0:59:44|[Commander Gao] squatted down and spread out the map. Now the enemy reinforcements on the southern road have reached close to Motian Ridge, intending to support the enemy at Fenghuang Mountain. Everyone stood up one after another.
1:0:13|1:0:33|Both sides saluted each other, with Commander Zhang leading his men away. Excitedly, Li Jin and others who were listening by the tree turned and ran off. The soldiers finished their rest, packed up their belongings, and prepared to set off again. The scene switched to the Nationalist army, with infantry walking on both sides and military vehicles driving in the middle.
1:0:33|1:0:38|Commander Zhang and Chief of Staff sit in the car, their expressions serious. Commander Zhang looks at his watch.
1:1:0|1:1:5|General Zhang crossed his arms, leaned back in the back seat, and furrowed his brow.
1:1:11|1:1:15|Zhang [Headmaster] looked disdainful. The chief of staff patted the driver on the shoulder, and the driver released the handbrake.
1:1:40|1:2:4|The scene shifts to a vast expanse of rugged mountains, with majestic and continuous peaks. White clouds billow up from the strange rock formations on the mountain peaks. The People's Liberation Army troops march vigorously on the steep mountain slopes. The soldiers climb rapidly upwards, forming a black dragon along the edge of the slope. They use both hands and feet, racing each other.
1:2:5|1:2:26|On the other side of the mountain peak, the Nationalist army was also climbing towards the summit with their guns. Some soldiers stumbled due to exhaustion, while on the misty side, the Communist soldiers were full of fighting spirit. They swiftly cleared a path through the rocky terrain, eager to reach the mountaintop.
1:2:26|1:2:41|The soldier in front reached out to grab the person behind, helping each other climb. One soldier struggled to climb up, grabbing onto the rocks above with both hands, but he fell backwards due to unstable footing. He struggled to stand up, and the soldier behind him also supported him.
1:2:41|1:2:46|Continuing to climb upwards, on the other side, the Nationalist soldiers were climbing unsteadily.
1:2:58|1:3:21|On the other side, the People's Liberation Army troops persistently climbed, soon to reach the mountaintop. Li Jin struggled to climb a small slope, looked up, gritted his teeth, and continued upwards. The Nationalist soldiers climbed up with great difficulty. Captain Zhang waved his hand behind him, and the soldiers behind him quickened their pace to cross over the mountain top.
1:3:21|1:3:43|Nationalist soldiers quickened their pace, while Liberation Army soldiers rushed down the hill with their guns, crouching behind cover with their gun barrels aimed at the Nationalist soldiers. The Nationalist soldiers were still climbing, while the machine gunner had already set up the machine gun at the gap. [Captain Liu] reloaded his gun, and Li Jin also checked the hand grenade in his hand.
1:3:43|1:3:51|Nationalist soldiers climbed the mountain while shooting upwards, creating a deafening sound of gunfire and filling the mountaintop with gunpowder smoke. [Captain Zhang] looked down below.
1:3:52|1:4:10|The soldiers behind cover opened fire one after another, with bullets continuously shooting out from the muzzles. The mountaintop was shrouded in thick smoke. The Nationalist commander, Commander Zhang, looked towards the mountaintop with a solemn expression.
1:4:53|1:5:5|[General Zhang] took the microphone and a soldier ran up to him. He opened a file, handed a piece of paper to the chief of staff, then turned and ran off. The chief of staff checked his watch, looking serious. He walked over to [General Zhang].
1:5:20|1:5:25|General Zhang glanced at his watch, it was already 4:34. He snatched the paper and tore it off. Headmaster Zhang continued to observe the battle with binoculars, while the PLA troops were building defensive fortifications on the mountain.
1:5:43|1:6:8|Captain Zhang pointed in a direction for two soldiers, who then took their chisels and shovels to repair the front bunker. Li Jin and three others sat on the slope, wiping their guns while anxiously looking into the distance. Commander Gao took down the binoculars in front of him, glanced back, and then continued observing.
1:6:20|1:6:40|Captain Zhang raised the brim of his hat, hands on his hips, anxiously waiting. Commander Gao looked back, then glanced down at his watch. It was already four fifty-eight. The soldiers were leaning on their guns, almost falling asleep. Suddenly, the sound of cannons rang out, and everyone excitedly stood up and looked towards the direction.
1:6:44|1:7:7|On the screen, the words "Phoenix Mountain General Attack Begins" appear. Team members fire the cannons, and countless shells fly towards the opposite hill, causing dust to fly. The cannons continue to fire, knocking down the enemy's fence, with shells continuously falling on the hillside. The battlefield is filled with smoke, and everywhere is covered in the dust raised by the exploding shells.
1:7:28|1:7:50|The artillerymen kept firing, blowing up an enemy bunker. At this moment, several soldiers hiding in the trenches attached bayonets to their rifles, waiting for orders, and charged out together. Hundreds of soldiers ran on the undulating terrain with grand momentum.
1:7:57|1:8:2|On the other side, the artillerymen are still continuously firing, with two artillerymen operating each gun.
1:8:11|1:8:17|The bugle sounded, and the soldiers charging forward quickly ran towards the hillside still shrouded in billowing smoke.
1:8:29|1:8:56|The enemies hiding in the trenches were shooting at the soldiers below the mountain, but they couldn't withstand the powerful firepower of the cannons and the brave charge of the soldiers. They turned around and started to run away. A soldier, unable to escape, simply squatted in the trench with his hands raised, indicating surrender. With the defeat of the army, the defense line of a division had been completely broken.
1:9:19|1:9:25|[Zhao Yumin] and the others were talking when a shell suddenly landed in the direction behind them, blowing a gap in the hilltop.
1:9:32|1:9:42|The soldiers in the trench raised their weapons, preparing for battle. The enemy's counterattack was fierce, with shells landing on the hillside, kicking up smoke and dust that obscured the view.
1:9:57|1:10:19|The enemy assault team climbed up from the bottom of the mountain and were shot down by the soldiers on the top of the mountain. Captain Zhang waved his hand vigorously, and the soldiers who were originally lying on the mountaintop stood up one after another, ran to the halfway point of the mountain, took cover behind the fortifications, and fiercely fired at the charging enemy.
1:10:38|1:10:54|After speaking, he continued to shoot at the enemy, while the machine gunner beside him kept firing. At that moment, a soldier behind cover was hit by a bullet and fell to the ground. The medic quickly ran forward to treat him, as more and more enemy soldiers fell under the intense machine gun fire.
1:11:3|1:11:25|Next to them, soldiers hid behind cover, quickly picking up grenades in front of them, pulling the pins, and throwing them at the enemy. Finally, under the smoke, the enemy killed two soldiers and broke through a gap. Nearby soldiers quickly opened fire, shooting down the enemy.
1:11:25|1:11:52|Some soldiers used the butt of their rifles to fiercely attack the enemy, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Nearby soldiers quickly ran over to support, and the oncoming enemy soldiers were all killed. The [PLA soldier] regained control of the front line. On the other side, the Nationalist officer communicated with the frontline soldiers via radio.
1:12:13|1:12:23|At this moment, the advancing soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have crossed over the hill and are running towards the smoking village not far away. The soldiers are moving forward in an orderly and fast manner.
1:12:30|1:12:57|In the village, the soldiers of the Kuomintang were still resisting. At the village entrance, a PLA soldier carrying explosives charged forward, but was hit by bullets and fell straight to the ground. His comrades quickly ran up behind him, picked up the explosives on the ground, and ran towards the village. Several Kuomintang soldiers hurriedly fled. Suddenly, the explosives exploded.
1:12:58|1:13:26|The soldier sacrificed his own life for his comrades' breakthrough. The soldiers at the village entrance rushed into the house. Inside a room, the Nationalist soldiers received a radio signal. As soon as the officer finished speaking, the PLA soldiers outside stormed in.
1:13:37|1:13:55|The officers in the rear heard about the situation in the village and looked serious. At this moment, the Liberation Army soldiers behind cover were still shooting with machine guns, while the Nationalist Army on the hillside had already been defeated and started fleeing downhill. Li Jin fired a few shots with his rifle and happily adjusted his hat.
1:14:5|1:14:16|Commander Gao quickly walked down the hill with a telegram in his hand. All the enemies on Phoenix Mountain have been dealt with. Captain Zhang shook open the telegram and read the message.
1:14:20|1:14:33|The crowd cheered and celebrated one after another as they passed around the telegram with "victory" written on it. The soldiers at the frontline bunker celebrated the victory with each other. A soldier ran over with the telegram, and everyone quickly gathered around.
1:14:45|1:14:51|Zhang [Headmaster] read the telegram with a smile, then suddenly thought of something and turned to [Commander Gao].
1:15:12|1:15:32|The soldiers behind were laughing and eagerly reading the telegram. [Commander Gao] walked past the soldiers with a smile, walking downhill and standing behind a dancing soldier. When the soldier turned around, he shyly covered his mouth, and [Commander Gao] patted his back, then continued walking forward with a smile. [Commander Gao] turned to answer the phone.
1:16:38|1:16:46|The officers all stood up, and Headmaster Zhang turned abruptly to look at the map on the table.
1:16:51|1:17:26|The Communist army has always had the characteristic of continuous combat, and their speed of movement is quite astonishing. Zhang [Headmaster] remained silent for a while. The military seat pondered for a moment, then turned and walked away. The chief of staff continued to study the map, holding a pen in his hand, with a pensive expression. He slowly picked up a piece of cloth, his eyes quickly scanning around.
1:17:29|1:17:33|Suddenly he thought of something and turned to [Commander Zhang].
1:18:7|1:18:19|General Zhang snorted and left with a sweep of his sleeves, while the chief of staff remained lost in thought. The scene shifted to [Headmaster] and a group of soldiers riding horses on a mountain path, approaching [Commander Gao] and others.
1:18:37|1:18:47|The [Headmaster] turned around, took the binoculars, and followed [Commander Gao]. With the accompaniment of [Commander Gao], he climbed to a high place, raised the binoculars, and looked into the distance. Then he put down the binoculars and said.
1:19:31|1:19:41|The two turned to look at the soldiers in the platoon, who quickly stood up. [Shi Zhengwei] walked over and stood in front of everyone. Everyone relaxed and sat on the side of the road, while [Shi Zhengwei] sat with the soldiers, observing them.
1:20:23|1:20:32|[Li Jing] and other soldiers were laughing happily on the side. [Li Jing] glanced at Wang Chun across from him, and then looked back at [Liu Yonggui].
1:21:49|1:22:5|The scene shifts to the Nationalist Army's tent, where a telegraph operator is sending a telegram under dim lighting. A military officer sits on a chair next to him, holding his head in his hands with a dejected expression.
1:22:9|1:22:29|[Zhao Yumin] sat at another table, head down in silence. [Headmaster] walked over to [Zhao Yumin] with a piece of paper in hand. Several officers gathered around as [Zhao Yumin] quickly took the telegram, furrowing her brow as she carefully read through it line by line.
1:22:37|1:22:41|[Zhao Yumin] put down the telegram, stood up, buttoned up his shirt collar, stood to the side, and buttoned up the buttons of his coat one by one. Commander Zhang wrapped a scarf around himself, and a guard brought a large coat for him to put on. The guard then turned and walked out of the tent.
1:23:6|1:23:31|Zhang [Commander] straightened his uniform, turned around, and put on his military cap. The Commander had a fierce look in his eyes as he put on his gloves. The scene switched to shells continuously falling on the slopes of Phoenix Mountain, causing dust to rise into the air. [Headmaster] and two others were sitting in a bunker, discussing their battle plan, when Captain Liu stood up upon hearing the noise.
1:23:33|1:23:55|[Shi Zhengwei] also stood up and looked towards the direction where the shells were being fired. The three of them looked up to observe their surroundings. The enemy's shells were falling randomly on the surrounding hills, and the sound of the cannons echoed among the mountains. [Shi Zhengwei] turned to look at [Headmaster]. [Headmaster] turned around, with a look of confusion on his face, and then looked up at the sky.
1:24:0|1:24:13|The three turned and walked away. The scene shifted to a military truck carrying many Nationalist soldiers wearing steel helmets retreating. Some soldiers took the opportunity to climb onto the truck, causing chaos and clamor on board.
1:24:13|1:24:27|Infantrymen stumbled along behind the truck with their guns. Several soldiers filled ammunition by the cannon, which then fired with thick smoke. They hung the cannon on the back of the truck and the driver glanced back before starting the vehicle.
1:24:30|1:24:42|Several soldiers climbed onto the side of the truck, which was moving slowly. Some soldiers sat on the barrel dragged by the truck, while others rode donkeys, pulled oxen ropes, or carried wounded soldiers following behind.
1:24:42|1:24:58|Seeing the people in front climbing onto the truck one after another, the soldier carrying the wounded immediately placed the stretcher on the ground and fought with the others to squeeze onto the vehicle. The people on the truck indiscriminately whipped down at them, while the wounded soldier struggled on the ground. No one paid attention to him. He stumbled, facing the direction the truck was driving away, helplessly lying in the middle of the road.
1:25:7|1:25:16|The scene shifts, with sunlight shining through the cracks in the clouds onto the mountains. [Li Jin] walks to the edge of the trench and looks down, [Liu Yonggui] approaches him and also looks down. The two men lock eyes, the scene changes, [Headmaster] is on the phone. [Headmaster] hangs up the phone. [Headmaster] and [Shi Zhengwei] turn and leave.
1:25:55|1:26:20|The scene shifts to the mainland, where the Kuomintang's trucks are kicking up a lot of dust on the dirt road. The convoy is carrying soldiers and equipment down the slope, while infantrymen are walking up the slope with their guns. Inside the vehicle, Commander Zhang presses his hand against his forehead, while the Chief of Staff frowns and smokes a cigarette, with white smoke coming out of his mouth and nose. He turns to the commander.
1:26:26|1:26:36|General Zhang did not answer immediately. He slowly put down his hand supporting his forehead and sighed. In other battlefields across the country, our army also suffered great losses.
1:27:1|1:27:10|Headmaster Zhang's brow remained furrowed as he looked at the advancing troops ahead. Commander Gao let out a deep sigh and gazed out of the window.
1:27:22|1:27:51|The light shines on his lonely expression. The scene switches to the continuous hills, with neatly arranged terraces and lush trees on the mountainside, a distant expanse of blue. The camera moves to a huge mountain crevice, where a young man is hiding, observing the Nationalist Army troops marching in the ancient battlefield in the distance.
1:27:53|1:27:59|He gestured with his hand towards the back, and [Zhao Yumin] looked up and nodded.
1:28:8|1:28:28|[Zhao Yumin] led the villagers down the mountain, running out of the valley. Another group of villagers also ran down the mountain to meet them. The villagers ran forward, with [Zhao Yumin] running in front with a gun. Then, he stopped to observe the surroundings, making a gesture for others to follow him.
1:28:28|1:28:48|The villagers ran over with tools, with [Zhao Yumin] following behind the team. The villagers began to chisel the surface of the mountain road. In the distance, the large forces of the Nationalist Army were marching towards them. [Zhao Yumin] sprinkled some powder from her clothes onto the road.
1:28:48|1:28:54|The villagers smoothed the road surface, everyone stood up and ran towards the distance with tools in hand.
1:28:57|1:29:19|On the high ground, a villager is standing guard with a gun, and Yumin's squad runs up the hill, with the guard running along with them. On the road next to a dead tree, the Nationalist army's transport trucks and infantry are still on the move, completely unaware of the villagers' actions, as the trucks carrying soldiers continue to move forward.
1:29:21|1:29:34|At this moment, a car suddenly crashed into the one in front, causing an explosion. Villagers raised their heads from the cover to look, and the car behind had to brake urgently. Soldiers panicked and scrambled to jump off the car to take cover, some guns misfired, and bullets flew everywhere.
1:29:34|1:29:45|The Chief of Staff opened the car door and looked ahead, [Zhao Yumin] and the villagers behind her all smiled. The scene switched, and the troops of the People's Liberation Army marched neatly on the main road.
1:29:46|1:30:13|The villagers welcomed them along the road, with many villagers pushing wheelbarrows and carrying goods down the mountain with shoulder poles. Their team also marched in an orderly manner from the mountains. The People's Liberation Army was warmly welcomed by the masses, with [Zhao Yumin] and several children standing together, one child touching the weapon in his hand.
1:30:20|1:30:43|Li Jin turned around and left, jumping down a hill and jogging to join the team. The team headed towards the fleeing village. The scene switched to a row of horses resting, swatting away mosquitoes with their tails. On the hillside, a few soldiers were on guard duty. The enemy was retreating south of the Dashaho River.
1:32:8|1:32:33|Several people salute each other. The cadres stand up and leave one by one, the scene changes. The People's Liberation Army troops, carrying guns and backpacks, march towards the distance with horses carrying supplies. Soldiers behind run to catch up, while two soldiers on fast horses turn into a side road and gallop up the hill to catch up with the front troops. The scene shifts to the Nationalist Army troops.
1:32:34|1:33:1|Two military vehicles are driving in the middle of the road, surrounded by dispirited soldiers walking with drooping heads and dragging their feet. The vehicles stop by the river, and the soldiers jump off. Commander Zhang and Chief of Staff walk by, with the soldiers following them, holding their guns.
1:33:47|1:33:49|Captain Liu frowned.
1:34:18|1:34:39|The scene shifts to the river in the distance, the water surface shimmering under the sunlight, the river flowing rapidly, carrying mud and eroding the riverbank. The scene then shifts to [Commander Gao] walking up to two sentries with his men, stepping onto a mound of soil.
1:34:42|1:34:53|The Nationalist Army is seen digging the river bank on the opposite side, as [Commander Gao] points to the soldiers on the other side. Several soldiers turn around and run towards the resting soldiers, everyone stands up, picks up their weapons, and runs towards the river bank in formation.
1:35:11|1:35:20|Captain Liu placed the machine gun by the river, supported his body with both hands and bent down to drink water. After a few sips, he shook his hand and stood up straight.
1:35:22|1:35:39|He wiped his mouth with his sleeve, picked up the machine gun and walked away. Two soldiers squatting down were rolling up their pants. [Li Jin] pointed forward, and the two stood up and left. [Li Jin] turned to [Liu Yonggui]. The troops cautiously crossed the river, soldiers wading through the water while observing the opposite bank. The water was flowing rapidly, shimmering in the sunlight.
1:35:46|1:36:15|The scene shifts, a truck from the Nationalist Army approaches from the distant road. It stops in the middle of the road. Several soldiers by the river gather around the truck, unloading sealed wooden boxes one by one. The scene returns to the People's Liberation Army, soldiers swiftly and carefully cross the river and reach the shore. [Commander Gao] stands in the ranks.
1:36:17|1:36:42|The troops ran into the woods, with [Commander Gao] following closely behind. The scene switched to the river, where muddy water flowed continuously. In a trench on the riverbank, explosives were placed, and two Nationalist soldiers were pulling the fuse while retreating. [Zhao Yumin] observed their actions from the side, frowning with a serious expression.
1:36:47|1:36:52|The truck carrying explosives drove away, [Zhao Yumin] stood up with a gun. He waved his hand backwards, and some of the guerrilla fighters stood up and ran with him. They turned around a stone embankment, and [Zhao Yumin] led the team to run forward along the gravel beach.
1:37:18|1:37:39|[Zhao Yumin] used both hands and feet to climb up a narrow staircase. The team members followed him cautiously, crouching low. The scene shifted to the entrance of the Kuomintang army's base, where two sentries were patrolling back and forth.
1:37:39|1:37:47|General Zhang is drinking from a tall glass inside the room. The Chief of Staff enters from outside, closes the door, and walks up to General Zhang, bending down.
1:37:49|1:38:15|Commander Gao raised his head and pondered for a moment, then suddenly stood up. The sound of cannons outside made both of them turn their heads and quickly walk to the window. Commander Gao pushed the window open and looked outside. In the midst of the intense gunfire, the soldiers of the Unsealing Army quickly moved forward with their weapons. They crouched behind cover, raised their guns, and launched an attack towards the enemy.
1:38:15|1:38:44|Some soldiers crouched and ran forward. Thick smoke and gunfire ahead. A group of soldiers dashed into the smoke, skillfully maneuvering around obstacles on the ground, continuing to move forward. Soldiers lying on the railway saw Commander Gao's gesture and jumped off the railway, running forward with their guns.
1:38:50|1:39:11|In the reconnaissance, PLA soldiers swiftly crossed the enemy's defense and launched an attack from within. The Nationalist soldiers were caught off guard and fled. Two Nationalist soldiers emerged from the tunnel and were caught by the PLA. Captain Liu bit open the ring pull, threw a grenade, and knocked down the fleeing enemies.
1:39:11|1:39:35|Several soldiers who had no way to escape turned around and fought back, only to be forced back by a hail of bullets. [Li Jin] ran down a flight of stairs and shot dead an enemy. He looked inside and saw another enemy crawling out to escape. Seeing him trying to flee, [Li Jin] chased after him, set up a machine gun in a gap, aimed, and opened fire.
1:39:35|1:39:55|Several enemies ran through the ruins trying to escape. A soldier emerged and shot one of the enemies, then fired a shot in the direction the enemy was fleeing. Everyone chased after them. Two enemies jumped into a trench, and the PLA soldier followed and fired a shot. They moved to the other side, set up their guns, aimed at the enemies outside, and opened fire.
1:39:55|1:40:4|Outside, fires are breaking out everywhere, with thick smoke billowing. The Nationalist Army is in disarray, with soldiers and officers scrambling to escape. The sound of gunfire shows no sign of diminishing.
1:40:12|1:40:28|Commander Gao ran over and crouched behind the cover to observe the other side. He turned back and signaled to the others. With a wave of his hand, a gunshot rang out. Suddenly, he kept covering his neck with his hand. Two soldiers quickly helped him to sit down on the side and examined his injury. The guard unbuttoned his collar.
1:40:28|1:40:34|Two soldiers examine the wound on Commander Gao's neck, one of them wraps the wound with white gauze, but Commander Gao turns his head away in refusal.
1:40:37|1:41:0|Commander Gao held the wound on his neck. The soldiers quickly got up and ran away, leaving Commander Gao leaning against the cover to catch his breath. The scene changes to the endless mountains, where two bright signal flares with long smoke trails fly towards the distance. On the small plain surrounded by mountains, the People's Liberation Army troops are marching.
1:41:1|1:41:24|The infantry marched in formation in the center, with [Headmaster] leading a team of soldiers riding horses quickly on one side of the formation. A soldier on horseback approached, saluting with a military salute. The soldier and the troops led by [Headmaster] rode quickly forward together.
1:41:28|1:41:38|The scene cuts to the Nationalist Party headquarters. A Nationalist officer with a bandage on his head stands dejectedly at the door. [Zhao Yumin] takes out a gun and places it on the table.
1:41:50|1:42:0|[Zhao Yumin] shot him in the abdomen, causing him to fall to the ground. The guards dragged him outside, and he was seen by Commander Gao who had just entered. Commander Gao quickly walked up to [Zhao Yumin].
1:42:44|1:43:8|The scene shifts to General's Temple Station, where PLA soldiers are rebuilding the defense fortifications that were destroyed. Captain Zhang is sitting, blinking his eyes, looking up, then down at his watch, 4:12. Commander Gao emerges from a corner, watching the soldiers working.
1:43:49|1:43:56|Soldiers turned around at the sound, and shells flashed in the night sky. They lay behind cover, readying their guns.
1:44:19|1:44:41|After a loud explosion, the airport was already in chaos. Captain Zhang and others observed in the distance as shells with black smoke fell, causing a large cloud of dust. The scene shifted to another PLA unit running forward on the road. Their steps were fast, horses carrying supplies led by soldiers, running forward in small steps.
1:44:45|1:45:9|The soldiers were either sitting in vehicles or riding on horseback, all in neat and heroic postures. [Headmaster] and [Shi Zhengwei] rode side by side on horses, leading their troops forward, leaving behind a neat silhouette along the way. The scene then shifted to the guerrilla team, with [Zhao Yumin] and a team member crawling forward under the barbed wire.
1:45:9|1:45:38|[Zhao Yumin] signaled with his eyes, and the team member carefully crawled out. He moved quickly while keeping an eye on the surroundings. Ermai held a gun, his eyes fixed on him. The team member used his arms to quickly crawl towards the riverbank. [Zhao Yumin] also watched him intently.
1:45:38|1:45:58|On a fortress, two Nationalist soldiers are on guard duty. On the side of the bomb, a team member is crawling towards from the side of the earth slope. He stops, reaches into his pocket, and a young soldier sees him. He taps his companion, and both raise their guns. Two gunshots are heard, and the team member's body trembles, his head tilts, and he stops moving.
1:45:58|1:46:7|A bullet hit the ground in front of Zhao Yumin, and he quickly ducked down. Two gun barrels protruded from the bunker, continuously firing bullets, while the team members closed their eyes and fell sideways on the slope.
1:46:13|1:46:28|[Zhao Yumin] saw the situation and quickly ran forward with a gun in hand. He bent down, took a few quick steps, then lay down and continued crawling forward. The guerrilla fighters also aimed their guns and returned fire. [Zhao Yumin] kept crawling forward, and ahead, many Nationalist soldiers were approaching.
1:46:28|1:46:39|The guerrilla fighters kept firing to cover [Zhao Yumin], who suddenly threw a grenade, knocking down the enemies in front. Then he threw another one, causing a large number of enemies behind to fall.
1:46:42|1:46:53|The team members were lying behind the rocks providing cover fire with intense bullets, while [Zhao Yumin] continued to crawl forward with a gun in hand, her eyes determined and brave. The scene then shifts to the Nationalist Army chief of staff listening on the phone.
1:47:3|1:47:25|The commander on the hill waved his hand, and a soldier covered his ears in anticipation of an explosion that never came. He quickly looked outside, only to see that the fuse of the explosives had been cut. [Zhao Yumin] held the scissors in her hand, letting out a long sigh of relief. The scene then shifted to a large number of People's Liberation Army troops running across the river.
1:47:25|1:47:29|They waded through the water effortlessly, creating ripples with each step.
1:47:34|1:48:0|The soldiers rode horses swiftly across the river, their hooves pounding powerfully, creating white splashes in the water. In the next scene, the [Headmaster] answered the phone, his expression changing drastically. He blinked in disbelief, then turned to Commander Zhang.
1:48:16|1:48:23|The Headmaster sat on the ground like thunderstruck, breathing heavily.
1:48:38|1:48:54|The guard brought the gloves of [Headmaster] and placed them on the table. He looked at the gloves, reached out, and slowly pulled them towards himself. The scene switched to a battlefield shrouded in smoke, with gunfire ringing out and buildings being hit by artillery, billowing thick smoke.
1:48:56|1:49:19|Many Kuomintang soldiers are running forward through the ruins, carrying guns. Tank troops are advancing amidst the gunfire, with the rubble burning on the side, emitting black smoke. The tank breaks through a horizontal wooden fence and continues moving forward.
1:49:23|1:49:41|Soldiers used tanks as cover, bending their waists and carrying guns while running behind. Captain Zhang and the machine gunner lay behind cover, continuously shooting forward. The soldiers also opened fire, shooting at the enemy across. The sound of gunfire was intense, with black smoke filling the air.
1:50:2|1:50:20|The enemy tanks advanced, with the tank treads crushing the sandbags where they had just been hiding. Inside the window, the soldiers' machine guns continued to spew flames. Suddenly, a shell blew a big hole in the building above, bricks fell down, instantly knocking down three soldiers.
1:50:20|1:50:28|In the ruins, the tank continued to advance unstoppably. A soldier ran towards the fallen Captain Zhang, who struggled to lift his head.
1:50:32|1:50:50|The soldier ran out quickly, Zhang, struggling, arrived at the machine gun beside him, grasped the machine gun, aimed, and continued to shoot at the enemy. Li Jin crawled out of the cover, stood up, took a few steps, lay down with his body sideways, and quickly moved in the ruins.
1:50:50|1:51:0|He rolled and lay on the roadside slope, the tank exerted force, Li Jin kept throwing several grenades, suddenly, he covered his chest and lay down. The soldiers were shooting.
1:51:2|1:51:28|Li Jin lifted his head, holding the explosive package, and continued to move forward quickly. He pulled the fuse with his teeth, then rolled to the side. A tank approached, and its tracks were blown up. Black smoke filled the air, the tank's tracks were blown off and rolled to the side. Li Jin lay on the ground, panting heavily, with a relieved smile on his face.
1:51:32|1:51:49|Captain Liu helped him up and held him in his arms, then gritted his teeth and put him down, continuing to charge forward with his gun. The soldiers behind him ran after him, with the last soldier helping up Li Jin. The instructor observed the situation and suddenly stood up.
1:52:6|1:52:21|The soldiers struggled to return to their positions, and a few soldiers launched a fierce charge. Several enemy soldiers jumped into a window and ran away, while two soldiers emerged from the middle, raised their guns and shot, causing the fleeing enemies to fall one after another.
1:52:22|1:52:37|Two soldiers hid behind cover, threw grenades, then jumped out. The Nationalist soldiers panicked and were intercepted and eliminated by the Communist Party members.
1:52:37|1:52:49|The enemy troops in the bunker abandoned their positions and fled to the rear. The soldiers pursued closely, some of the enemy soldiers scattered in all directions, some put up stubborn resistance, all of them were eliminated one by one by the soldiers of the Liberation Army.
1:53:1|1:53:20|In the formation, the soldiers held their positions and launched a fierce artillery attack towards the enemy position. With the charge of the soldiers in the front, more soldiers jumped out of their cover. With a command, the cannon barrel trembled violently and fired the shells.
1:53:20|1:53:29|A row of cannons fired shells one by one, prompting the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to march quickly across the calm river. A large number of reinforcements soldiers hurried towards the battlefield.
1:53:35|1:54:3|Commander Gao shouted to everyone, and a new round of charge began. The charge signal sounded, and the soldiers rushed forward with their guns without hesitation, running towards the fleeing enemies on the battlefield full of ruins. Under the blue sky and white clouds, the reinforcements arrived, and a large number of soldiers shouted as they launched the final charge forward.
1:54:5|1:54:28|They ran across the flat ground, dashed down the bunker, leaped over the trench, and bravely charged towards the enemy. The enemy was scared by their momentum and turned to flee. They ran to a big cannon, hesitated for a moment, then turned around and continued to run away.
1:54:28|1:54:34|A large number of PLA soldiers rushed through the breach, bypassed obstacles, and intercepted the enemy who had no time to escape.
1:54:42|1:54:51|The shells landed, raising black smoke. Soldiers ran through the smoke, chasing the enemy.
1:54:56|1:55:14|An enemy ran up the hill, staggered, and fell down. Soldiers followed and more PLA soldiers on horseback charged forward, brandishing their weapons. The hooves of the horses raised a lot of dust on the ground. The enemy ahead panicked and fled in all directions. The cavalrymen climbed over a dirt mound and pursued the remaining enemies.
1:55:14|1:55:18|An enemy was just shot dead as he poked his head out of the tank turret, slumping over on top of the tank.
1:55:19|1:55:34|Several enemies ran down the hill and were intercepted by a soldier coming from the side. The soldier immediately engaged in hand-to-hand combat with an enemy officer. After a few moves, he pushed the enemy to the ground, ruthlessly stabbed with a bayonet, then pulled out the knife and ran away. One enemy soldier grabbed [Captain Liu], while another soldier knocked him down from behind.
1:55:34|1:55:41|A soldier stood on top of a tank and fired downwards, causing the enemy to fall to the ground. Another team rushed in from the side, and everyone chased forward together.
1:55:45|1:56:4|The remaining enemy soldiers followed behind a surviving tank, shooting backwards as they ran. Some fell heavily to the ground, while others crawled and scrambled to escape. The situation seemed to be under control. Commander Gao stood in the rushing tide of the charge, glanced back, waved his hand, and everyone continued to run forward.
1:56:4|1:56:10|As far as the eye can see, Liberation Army soldiers are everywhere. The enemy tanks are struggling to climb up a dirt slope.
1:56:12|1:56:31|The remaining soldiers of the Nationalist Party followed behind, while a large number of enemy troops were running forward, intending to counterattack, but were forced back by several Liberation Army soldiers with guns. The soldiers following behind the tank turned and ran, the top of the tank was lifted, a white flag was raised, and the soldiers with nowhere to escape surrendered their weapons.
1:56:31|1:56:40|Two soldiers aimed their guns at the tank's hatch, the staff officer raised his hands and crawled out of the driver's cabin, followed by Commander Zhang poking his head out.
1:56:44|1:57:5|The People's Liberation Army welcomed the final victory. A group of soldiers joyfully ran on the main road, waving down from the truck. In the distance, several soldiers stood on tanks searching for spoils of war. Some other soldiers stood on tanks, holding guns to monitor the dejected prisoners being escorted along the main road.
1:57:10|1:57:32|On the other side, the villagers rushed excitedly towards the triumphant soldiers, warmly shaking hands and embracing them. [Zhao Yumin] patted Captain Zhang's shoulder in comfort, Li Jin had one arm in a bandage and warmly shook hands with his fellow villagers, while Commander Gao and [Zhao Yumin] smiled at each other.
1:57:52|1:58:4|Three people looked around in the crowd, Yonggui's sister-in-law walked among the crowd, looking around, searching for her husband. Erman ran over and grabbed her arm, and the two of them ran away laughing. [Zhao Yumin] walked excitedly towards Zhao's mother.
1:58:9|1:58:31|Zhao Dama held her daughter's arm and gazed at her. Ermei and Yonggui's wife walked towards [Captain Liu]. The two ran over, and [Headmaster] grinned. The three of them burst into laughter at the same time. Zhao Dama patted [Commander Gao].
1:58:47|1:58:57|Soldiers were seen escorting several prisoners, who were carrying a stretcher, surrounded by everyone.
1:59:7|1:59:29|Commander Gao lifted the blanket and Colonel Zhang, with his head wrapped in bandages, opened his eyes, then closed them without saying a word. Commander Gao covered him with the blanket. Headmaster stood on the military vehicle, comforting the soldiers on both sides. They got off the vehicle, walked towards the soldiers, and warmly shook hands with them.
