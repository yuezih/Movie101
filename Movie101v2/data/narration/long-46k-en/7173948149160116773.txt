0:0:38|0:0:51|In the setting sun, [Huyan Dazang] is wielding his sword, cutting down the wooden figures surrounding him in a circle. With swift movements, he strikes down, leaving the wooden figures in ruins. In an instant, the screen displays the title of the movie "Love Sword".
0:0:51|0:0:57|In the inn, [Huyan Dazang] and [Bai Sankong] sat facing each other, with [Huyan Dazang] crossing his arms in front of his chest while [Bai Sankong] stared at him intently.
0:0:58|0:1:11|During the fight, [Huyan Dazang] reached out his hand to attack [Bai Sankong], who raised his arm to block Huyan Dazang's arm, and the two wrestled together. Then, Huyan Dazang extended his other hand to continue the attack on Bai Sankong, but it was pressed down on the table.
0:1:14|0:1:23|Shortly after, [Huyan Dazang] lifted his foot and kicked [Bai Sankong], then pulled out his arms. [Bai Sankong] blocked [Huyan Dazang]'s attack, and after exchanging punches in the air, both fell backwards onto the ground.
0:1:23|0:1:32|Suddenly, [Bai Sankong] kicked the table away, and the two fought under the flying table. As the table fell, their fists were only a foot apart.
0:1:42|0:1:46|[Huyan Dazang] instantly kicked over the table, then he pierced through the table and drew out his sword.
0:2:2|0:2:19|The two then drew their swords and faced each other, swinging their swords in the inn, creating multiple shadows in the air. They then continued their fight from the inn to the outside, with the inn's guests fleeing outside. Just as [Bai Sankong] launched an attack, [Huyan Dazang] struck him down from a height with a sword.
0:2:20|0:2:37|[Bai Sankong] fell heavily to the ground, followed closely by [Huyan Dazang], who then stepped on [Bai Sankong]'s sword. Subsequently, [Huyan Dazang] slowly sheathed the sword, his unrestrained long hair fluttering in the wind, standing with a heroic aura. At the funeral of [Bai Sankong], everyone was dressed in mourning clothes, kneeling in worship.
0:2:47|0:3:11|On the outskirts of the inn, [Huyan Dazang] and [Mulang Shenjun] are wielding their swords, causing the onlookers to flee in panic. As they soar through the air and land, [Huyan Dazang] uses his blade to clamp down on [Mulang Shenjun]'s sword, then twists and breaks it. With a forceful strike forward, [Huyan Dazang] pushes [Mulang Shenjun] backwards.
0:3:11|0:3:16|Speak, [Huyan Dazang] picked up the knife and handed it to [Mulang Shenjun]. [Mulang Shenjun] took the knife, and [Huyan Dazang] turned and left.
0:3:42|0:3:45|Later, the two of them arrived at a tavern.
0:3:53|0:4:14|At this moment, fireworks rose outside the house, and [Mulang Shenjun] looked alertly towards the outside. [Huyan Dazang] escorted [Mulang Shenjun] away, only to be stopped by a young boy.
0:4:20|0:4:31|[Huyan Dazang] squatted down, smiling as he touched the boy's face, only to be stabbed by the boy. Then, [Huyan Dazang] looked down at the dagger stuck in his chest, and then looked up at the fleeing boy.
0:4:31|0:4:45|The people around gathered, [Huyan Dazang] slowly fell down, holding the dagger in his hand, his body trembling uncontrollably. On the other side, [Mulang Shenjun] was walking towards the Thousand Household Army camp. [Mulang Shenjun] raised his shield, and the soldiers made way for him.
0:4:48|0:4:57|At night, [Huyan Dazang] staggered into an abandoned house. He looked up at [Zhu'er] in front of him, then collapsed beside the fence.
0:5:9|0:5:22|On this clear morning, [Huyan Dazang] slowly opened his eyes. The dilapidated walls let in the glaring morning light. Startled, he sat up and looked around at the unfamiliar surroundings, his gaze settling on his bandaged chest. Then, [Duchess Tuo Chen] approached.
0:5:41|0:5:47|[Huyan Dazang] smiled and nodded, then [Zhu'er] stood up and walked to the side.
0:6:26|0:6:31|Just as [Huyan Dazang] was handing the sword to Zhu Wa, [Li Xiaoran] led a group of people rushing over.
0:7:5|0:7:11|[As Huyan Dazang] raised his hand and the knife fell, [Li Xiaoran] collapsed.
0:7:21|0:7:24|Shortly after, [Huyan Dazang] walked towards the outside of the house.
0:7:52|0:7:58|Inside the house, [Fang Baoyu] kneels in front of [Purple Marquis], while outside the city, [Huyan Dazang] and Yuzhong are crouching under a tree.
0:8:25|0:8:28|[Huyan Dazang] is playing with a twig in his hand.
0:8:53|0:9:1|Speak, [Huyan Dazang] then strides away.
0:10:6|0:10:19|At this moment, [Huyan Dazang] walked through the crowd with a sword from the other end, while the Purple Marquis stood on a high place watching him. [Huyan Dazang] arrived at the center of the Hai Long Pier, with the crowd behind him surrounding the path he took. He stood still and raised his head.
0:10:23|0:10:35|Purple Marquis stared at [Huyan Dazang]'s sword, then the two of them came to the deck, wielding their blades in the air. [Huyan Dazang] leaped into the air, and Purple Marquis frowned as he caught the sword thrust by [Huyan Dazang].
0:10:35|0:10:46|The two then turned and intertwined, swords thrusting at each other one after another. [Huyan Dazang] bent down and slid towards the feet of the Purple Marquis. The Purple Marquis leaped backwards into the air, then landed on the deck.
0:10:48|0:10:59|At this moment, [Huyan Dazang] looked up and then split the dock in half, leaping up and fighting side by side with the Purple Marquis. The Purple Marquis, unwilling to show weakness, shot an arrow into [Huyan Dazang]'s arrow.
0:10:59|0:11:11|[Huyan Dazang] twisted his body, and [Purple Marquis] flew up in the air with an arrow, the two of them locked in a stalemate. In the distance, [Duchess Tuo Chen] was anxious. At that moment, [Huyan Dazang] kicked Mulang Shenjun off the boat, and Mulang Shenjun quickly flew towards [Duchess Tuo Chen] in the crowd.
0:11:11|0:11:14|Mulang Shenjun immediately stood in front of Duchess Tuo Chen and was not hit by Mulang Shenjun.
0:11:19|0:11:34|Shortly after, the two of them gazed at each other, while in the distance, Duchess Tuo Chen was still battling with Huyan Dazang. At that moment, Huyan Dazang suddenly squatted down, spun and leaped into the air, then waved his arrow towards Duchess Tuo Chen. Duchess Tuo Chen fixed his gaze, stood his ground, and dodged the arrow.
0:11:34|0:11:45|The people standing on the shore all widened their eyes, mouths agape in fear. [Zhu'er] stood in the crowd, anxiously staring at the two on the boat, Mulang Shenjun and [Duchess Tuo Chen], also watching their every move on the boat.
0:11:45|0:11:50|Shortly after, the [Purple Marquis] spiraled in the air and flew towards [Huyan Dazang], who was repeatedly struck and forced to retreat.
0:11:51|0:12:9|In an instant, the sword of [Purple Marquis] aimed at the chest of [Huyan Dazang]. [Zhu'er] widened her eyes on the shore, [Huyan Dazang] lowered his head to look at his chest, and in a flash, [Purple Marquis] withdrew his sword. Then, [Huyan Dazang] raised his head, flew into the water, and at that moment, everyone disappeared to the shore, with [Zhu'er] rushing to the front and falling down on the shore.
0:13:7|0:13:13|On the river bank, [Huyan Dazang] hands the grilled fish to [Zhu'er]. [Zhu'er] turns her head away.
0:13:45|0:13:51|In the Taoist temple, [Purple Marquis] and the Taoist priest are practicing swordsmanship among the falling leaves, while on the other side, amidst the rapeseed flowers.
0:13:54|0:13:59|The inevitable final battle has arrived, with [Zhu'er] and [Huyan Dazang] fighting side by side.
0:14:18|0:14:22|[Huyan Dazang] turned his head and looked into the distance, while [Zhu'er] stared at his back.
0:15:11|0:15:26|[Zhu'er] had tears in her eyes, while [Huyan Dazang] stood expressionless, his eyes becoming increasingly fierce. Drawing his sword, [Huyan Dazang] held it in front of [Zhu'er], who blinked back tears and furrowed her brow, staring intently into [Huyan Dazang]'s eyes.
0:15:26|0:15:33|Shortly after, [Zhu'er] raised her hand and brought [Huyan Dazang]'s sword to her own neck. Suddenly, [Huyan Dazang] lifted his eyes and looked at [Zhu'er].
0:15:46|0:16:0|Words fell silent, tears welled up in [Zhu'er]'s eyes, [Huyan Dazang] looked anxiously at [Zhu'er]'s hand holding the sword. [Huyan Dazang]'s gaze dodged, tears also washed her eyes clean.
0:16:4|0:16:19|Zhu Er looked at [Huyan Dazang] with sadness, a large tear rolled down from the corner of his eye. At this moment, the bright rapeseed flowers around them were in full bloom, and the two of them, surrounded by flowers, gazed into each other's eyes. In an instant, Zhu Er suddenly exerted force, widening his eyes.
0:16:19|0:16:37|Zhu Er raised the sword in Huyan Dazang's hand, reaching towards his own neck. In an instant, Dazang grabbed the sword, frowning and staring tightly at the sword in his hand. Zhu Er lowered his head to look at Dazang's hand, and at that moment, Dazang's hand holding the sword slowly oozed blood. Dazang then released his grip on the sword, leaving a bloodstain on it.
0:16:37|0:16:40|Soon after, the two embraced tightly in a sea of flowers.
0:17:14|0:17:29|In the Taoist temple, the ground was covered with dry leaves, and the censer in the temple was still emitting smoke. Huyan Dazang and Fang Baoyu stood face to face in the center of the temple. At that moment, they drew their swords, with Huyan Dazang raising his sword and rushing towards Fang Baoyu. Fang Baoyu lowered his head, bent his waist, and spun as he retreated backwards.
0:17:30|0:17:48|Shortly after, Daoist Huyan Dazang launched an attack towards Fang Baoyu. As Dazang moved forward to attack, Daoist Ben Yue leaped into the air and somersaulted to intercept Dazang's attack. Dazang turned around and struggled to block Daoist Ben Yue's sword. Then, Dazang raised his hands and placed the sword behind his back, perfectly catching the sword thrust from Daoist Ben Yue.
0:17:49|0:18:4|Huyan Dazang then used his strength to strike Dao Chang's chest with a palm. Dao Chang was forced to step back continuously. Huyan Dazang dropped his sword and stood still, while Dao Chang, with one hand holding the sword, had a trace of blood flowing from the corner of his mouth. In an instant, Huyan Dazang suddenly squatted down and spun like a top.
0:18:5|0:18:18|He waved his arrow and soared into the air. As the Taoist turned his head, Huyan Dazang had already flown in front of him. The Taoist pounced forward, and Huyan Dazang leaped behind him, then an arrow pierced the Taoist's abdomen, followed by a gush of blood from the Taoist's mouth.
0:18:18|0:18:29|It's late at night, [Fang Baoyu] and Huyan Dazang are sitting side by side in front of the small courtyard gate. [Fang Baoyu] is roasting meat by the fire, while Huyan Dazang is adding firewood to the fire. Then, [Fang Baoyu] hands the meat to Huyan Dazang.
0:18:40|0:18:55|Huyan Dazang took the meat and suddenly stopped. In an instant, a fire crossbow shot into the wooden stake beside the two, then a group of people holding fire crossbows rushed out from the distant woods.
0:19:8|0:19:32|Later, Duchess Tuo Chen and Mulang Shenjun rescued Huyan Dazang and Zhu'er. Meanwhile, Purple Marquis was packing his bags. Fang Baoyu stood beside Purple Marquis. At that moment, Purple Marquis raised his hand to gesture for Fang Baoyu to sit down with him.
0:20:0|0:20:7|Many people didn't take her seriously. Until one day.
0:20:20|0:20:24|Saying that, [Purple Marquis] stood up, and [Fang Baoyu] also stood up.
0:20:29|0:20:38|At this moment, Lord [Ben Yue] walked in. [Zhu'er], [Huyan Dazang], and others were about to leave the cabin, but were stopped.
0:20:54|0:21:13|[Huyan Dazang] kicked the sword, the sword flew out of its sheath and stabbed towards the enemy. At the same time, [Huyan Dazang] and [Mulang Shenjun] rushed towards the enemy. [Huyan Dazang] swung the sword as enemies approached one by one. On the other side, [Mulang Shenjun] stabbed and kicked the enemies down. The enemies fell one by one as [Zhu'er] sword struck, igniting a pack of gunpowder.
0:21:13|0:21:21|Later, [Huyan Dazang], [Ben Yue], [Duchess Tuo Chen], and [Mulang Shenjun] stood in a row, with [Ben Yue] throwing out gunpowder, causing the enemies to fall down one after another.
0:21:22|0:21:43|In the smoke, [Zhu'er] was caught by [Wang Dian]. In the wilderness, several people rode horses towards the distance. [Wang Dian] sat on the horse, with two attendants standing behind him. Watching the departing group, [Wang Dian] then took out a piece of paper from his sleeve.
0:22:2|0:22:6|The sky was cloudless for thousands of miles, with [Huyan Dazang] and [Mulang Shenjun] crouching in front of the Qingmu Palace.
0:22:19|0:22:23|Duchess Tuo Chen walked out with a smile, and the two turned to look at her.
0:22:50|0:22:57|Shortly after, the two turned and walked towards the Qingmu Palace. By the riverbank, [Fang Baoyu] was kneeling in front of the tomb of Huo Feiteng.
0:23:16|0:23:30|He furrowed his brows at first, then slowly reached into his clothes and pulled out a book full of creases, handing it over to [Fang Baoyu]. [Fang Baoyu] took the book and immediately looked at the page, which read "Borrowing the Sun in the Secret Palace".
0:23:45|0:23:59|On the other side, [Wang Dian] stood alertly outside a room, ready to knock on the door. He then pushed the door open, closed it behind him, and walked over to [Bai Sankong] with a smile.
0:24:40|0:24:47|After finishing speaking, [Huyan Dazang] first arrived at the tomb of Huo Tengfei, knelt down, and inserted his sword into the soil behind him.
0:25:23|0:25:28|Saying that, [Huyan Dazang] first lowered his head and sighed, then looked towards the tombstone.
0:25:55|0:26:6|At this moment, as he picked up a stone from the ground and walked towards the tomb, just as he raised the stone to smash the tombstone, a long silk ribbon flew from behind and wrapped around his hand. Then, [White Water Saintess] flew in and landed in front of him.
0:26:29|0:26:51|Saying that, [White Water Saintess] soared into the air and swung her sleeves towards the Drunken Immortal on the ground. The Drunken Immortal dodged, but then the sleeves heavily hit the ground. [White Water Saintess] took the opportunity to entangle the Drunken Immortal with her other sleeve, lifting him up into the air before slamming him back down. [White Water Saintess] then descended from the air.
0:26:51|0:26:56|At that moment, [Fang Baoyu] suddenly sprang out from the ground, she lay on the ground and rubbed her eyes with her sleeve.
0:27:0|0:27:15|Shortly after, [Fang Baoyu] staggered to her feet. She squinted at the sun overhead, its intense rays making it difficult for her to keep her eyes open. She reached out her hand to shield herself.
0:27:15|0:27:25|Saying that, [White Water Saintess] extended her sleeve and swung it towards [Fang Baoyu]. The first one to stand up and block was hit first. Seeing this, [Fang Baoyu] stepped forward and pushed the first one away. The first one was pushed by this palm and flew out, falling to the ground.
0:27:49|0:27:59|That night, [Fang Baoyu] sat cross-legged on the bed, treating Mi Xian's injuries. Mi Xian sat in front of [Fang Baoyu], his hands falling from the top of his head, while [White Water Holy Mother] peeked from the door crack.
0:28:10|0:28:21|[Bai Shui Shengmu] slipped away from the door, and when [Fang Baoyu] turned around, he saw a fleeting figure and immediately chased after. As [Fang Baoyu] arrived at the empty space in front of the door, [Bai Shui Shengmu] was standing with her back to him.
0:28:35|0:28:52|As soon as the words fell, [Fang Baoyu] drew his sword and rushed towards [White Water Saint Mother]. [Fang Baoyu] soared in the palace and thrust his sword towards the opponent. After [White Water Saint Mother] dodged, they began to wrestle. Just as [White Water Saint Mother] was about to attack [Fang Baoyu]'s chest with her hand, [Duchess Tuo Chen] suddenly appeared and intercepted the blow.
0:28:52|0:28:54|Immediately, [White Water Holy Mother] flew towards the distance.
0:29:3|0:29:6|At this moment, [Fang Baoyu] glanced to the side and smiled.
0:30:0|0:30:5|Mulang Shenjun and Huyan Dazang sat by the river bank, their shoulders touching.
0:30:30|0:30:40|On this day, at the martial arts competition, [Wang Dian] stood up with a smile and bowed to everyone. Beside him sat [Purple Marquis] and others. After bowing, [Wang Dian] straightened his back with his hands behind him.
0:32:12|0:32:21|[Wang Dian] waved his hand to signal the attendant to bring [Zhu'er] out. Everyone looked towards the distance. At this moment, [Zhu'er] walked out from the crowd with her hands tied.
0:33:8|0:33:19|At this moment, [Bai Yanzhu] suddenly flew out from behind the octagonal arena, landing on the ground and walking forward. She was followed by a group of guards, with [Duchess Tuo Chen], [Ben Yue], and [Mulang Shenjun] standing beside her.
0:33:19|0:33:24|[Wang Dian] fixed his gaze ahead, [Zhu Er] also turned to look at [Duchess Tuo Chen], who was also staring at [Zhu Er].
0:33:28|0:33:35|At this moment, [Zhu'er] smiled gently, while the crowd on the platform exuded a fierce momentum.
0:33:41|0:33:52|On the opposite side, [Wang Dian]'s face twitched, then [Huyan Dazang] walked out from the center of the group with a sword in hand. All eyes turned to [Huyan Dazang], who slowly walked towards [Wang Dian] and stood in the middle of the road.
0:33:52|0:34:1|At this moment, [Wang Dian] sat beside [Fang Baoyu], frowning and staring intently at [Huyan Dazang], while [Wang Dian]'s gaze also fell on [Huyan Dazang].
0:34:52|0:35:3|At this moment, [Fang Baoyu] slowly stood up, then walked through the crowd and approached [Huyan Dazang]. The onlookers nervously watched [Huyan Dazang] as he stood still without showing any signs of panic on his calm face.
0:35:3|0:35:10|[Fang Baoyu] slowly approached [Huyan Dazang], who was holding a sword, and then calmly raised his head to look at [Fang Baoyu].
0:36:20|0:36:31|Shortly after, the two put away their swords. On the other side, [Ben Yue] was in the room, trembling as she picked up the dagger hidden under the pillow, holding it tightly in her hand.
0:36:36|0:36:50|Finally, he slowly pulled out the dagger, inching it towards his wrist. He trembled, then slid it forcefully. [Duchess Tuo Chen] frowned, gritting her teeth as blood gradually stained his shoes.
0:36:56|0:36:59|At this moment, everyone dared to step forward and gather around the bed.
0:37:7|0:37:13|Ben Yue weakly sat up and looked at Fang Baoyu, while Duchess Tuo Chen sat by the bed, smiling as she supported Ben Yue's shoulder.
0:37:50|0:38:0|Speak, [Ben Yue] looked at [Wang Dian] standing in front of her. On this day, [Fang Baoyu] slowly woke up from the bed. She turned her head to look beside her, [Zhu'er] was leaning on [Fang Baoyu]'s shoulder, sound asleep.
0:38:0|0:38:12|[Fang Baoyu] suddenly sat up straight, and at that moment [Zhu'er] also jolted awake from her dream, then quickly sat up, staring at [Fang Baoyu] in shock.
0:38:22|0:38:27|[Zhu'er] slapped [Fang Baoyu] in the face, while [Wang Tianzheng] paced back and forth anxiously.
0:38:46|0:39:1|At this moment, the door of the room suddenly opened, and [Fang Baoyu], who was dressing, fixed his gaze on the door. [Ben Yue] was standing blankly outside the door, dressed up with a flower crown on her head. Beside her, [Zhou Er] was in a panic. [Ben Yue] furrowed her brows, looking at [Fang Baoyu] with sadness.
0:39:30|0:39:37|Speak, [Ben Yue], turn and leave. Outside the house, at the martial arts competition, [Huyan Dazang] strides forward angrily.
0:39:39|0:39:53|[Wang Dian], [Purple Marquis], and others all gazed at [Huyan Dazang], as everyone stood in place discussing animatedly. Just then, [Ben Yue] suddenly rushed in, dressed in a phoenix coronet and holding an arrow in hand, aiming straight at [Huyan Dazang], capturing the attention of the onlookers.
0:39:53|0:40:0|At this moment, Purple Marquis looked up and saw Ben Yue, who was waving his arrows and charging towards Huyan Dazang.
0:40:12|0:40:14|Shortly after, [Fang Baoyu] and [Zhu'er] also arrived one after another.
0:40:32|0:40:35|[Huyan Dazang] suddenly turned his head and looked at [Zhu'er].
0:40:53|0:41:12|With a shout, [Huyan Dazang] drew his sword and thrust towards [Fang Baoyu], who dodged and stepped back. [Fang Baoyu] grabbed [Huyan Dazang]'s hand and then was kicked away. At that moment, [Duchess Tuo Chen] blocked [Huyan Dazang]'s sword, while [Ben Yue] rushed forward and embraced the blinded [Huyan Dazang].
0:41:26|0:41:37|Shortly after, [Huyan Dazang] embraced [Fang Baoyu] and tears soaked his eyes. At that moment, [Wang Dian] on the side was muttering something with his mouth opening and closing, and suddenly [Fang Baoyu] widened her eyes.
0:41:41|0:41:57|Immediately, [Huyan Dazang] showed a pained expression, trembling as he held [Fang Baoyu]'s hand. Then, he slowly released the embrace, lowered his head, and saw [Fang Baoyu] pulling out a dagger in an instant. Dazang widened his eyes, looking at the dagger in [Fang Baoyu]'s hand covered in blood, then gazing at [Fang Baoyu]'s face.
0:41:57|0:42:11|At this moment, a sly smile appeared on [Zhu'er]'s face. The people around her gathered to watch, and [Huyan Dazang] clutched his stomach in pain, looking at [Zhu'er] in agony. Then he trembled, released the sword in his hand, and fell down.
0:42:11|0:42:16|[Zhu'er] then looked at [Huyan Dazang] lying on the ground beside her, the dagger in her hand still dripping with blood.
0:42:27|0:42:44|Shortly after, [Bai Yanzhu]'s henchman threw a smoke bomb and then disappeared. On that day, [Zhu'er] staggered to a section of stone steps, weakly climbing the stairs but fell by the roadside. He then looked up at the plaque in front of him, which read "Qingfeng An".
0:42:44|0:42:50|He exerted himself to prop up his body and continued to climb upwards. Shortly after, [Zhu'er] staggered to the front gate of Qingfeng An.
0:43:4|0:43:19|[Zhu Er] leaned against the gate and fainted. At that moment, a nun inside noticed him. Outside the Qianhu military camp, soldiers were guarding the gate closely, while [Mulang Shenjun] walked towards the camp. Meanwhile, [Fang Baoyu] was hiding in a nearby bush, secretly observing.
0:43:21|0:43:41|On the other side of the street, it was very lively. [Huyan Dazang] walked unsteadily alone in the middle of the street, with a flight of stairs in sight. He leaned on his sword and walked over unsteadily, then sat on the steps and placed his sword beside him. Three beggars sat around, watching the weak [Huyan Dazang].
0:43:41|0:43:46|The beggars turned back one after another, [Huyan Dazang] was closing his eyes and resting on the steps.
0:43:50|0:44:6|Three beggars stared closely at the sword beside [Huyan Dazang], cautiously approaching him. The leader of the beggars, leaning on a crutch, came up to [Huyan Dazang], while another beggar reached for the sword nearby. At that moment, [Huyan Dazang] opened his eyes and kicked the beggar in the chest.
0:44:17|0:44:29|While they were talking, a beggar knocked [Huyan Dazang] down with a crutch, and three people started punching and kicking [Huyan Dazang]. At that moment, [Zhu'er] suddenly emerged from the crowd.
0:44:42|0:44:55|[Zhu'er] bent down to look at [Huyan Dazang], who raised his head and looked at the anxious face of [Zhu'er]. Dazang remembered that the two of them were in a field of rapeseed flowers before, where [Zhu'er] cried and tried to commit suicide with a knife. Dazang stopped her with his hand, leaving a trace of blood on the knife.
0:44:55|0:44:59|Dazang recalled how at the martial arts competition, Duchess Tuo Chen stabbed into his body with a dagger.
0:45:13|0:45:28|It's late at night, in the military camp, soldiers are marching in formation with iron spears on their shoulders. The camp is filled with fluttering battle flags and the roaring bonfires emit hot sparks. A row of soldiers is passing by. Suddenly, [Fang Baoyu] covers the mouth and nose of the last soldier, pressing him against the wall.
0:45:49|0:46:3|[Fang Baoyu] immediately raised his hand and knocked out the soldier. A figure flashed through the tent, and [Fang Baoyu] entered the camp. He quietly lifted the blanket on the bed, only to find that it was disguised as a human-shaped bedding. Then, he widened his eyes and ran out of the camp.
0:46:3|0:46:12|At this moment, the soldiers outside were standing in formation, and [Mulang Shenjun] approached [Fang Baoyu] with his guards. In an instant, the two locked eyes, a faint smile crossing [Mulang Shenjun]'s face.
0:46:53|0:47:2|In an instant, a thousand arrows were released simultaneously, [Fang Baoyu] leaped into the tent, and soldiers rushed out in unison, countless crossbows from all directions aimed at [Fang Baoyu].
0:47:2|0:47:17|[Fang Baoyu] suddenly soared into the air, narrowly avoiding the densely shot arrows. Just as he leaped into the air, a sudden arrow struck the sword in [Fang Baoyu]'s hand. With the setting sun, in the desolate wilderness, [Fang Baoyu] staggered through the vast desert.
0:47:18|0:47:36|Suddenly, [Fang Baoyu] fell to the ground. She struggled to prop herself up with her hands, trying to get up, but her body felt as heavy as if it were filled with lead. In the early morning, [Ben Yue] placed the chopped vegetables by the pot, and at that moment, [Huyan Dazang] walked in.
0:47:57|0:48:2|[Zhu'er] was pulled back by [Huyan Dazang] as she turned around. She turned back and looked into [Huyan Dazang]'s affectionate eyes.
0:48:50|0:49:7|[Huyan Dazang] stepped forward to continue holding [Zhu'er]'s hand. At this moment, the two locked eyes. The delicate beauty of [Zhu'er]'s face reflected in [Huyan Dazang]'s eyes. [Zhu'er] furrowed her brows as she looked at the hand being held, then gazed into [Huyan Dazang]'s eyes. She gently withdrew her hand, leaving [Huyan Dazang]'s hand still suspended in the air, trembling slightly.
0:49:8|0:49:11|The black-clothed guest from Qingping Villa, a touch of the setting sun, the seven evil spirits.
0:49:41|0:49:50|The mysterious figure turned around and took off the hat, [Mulang Shenjun] looked closely and realized it was [Bai Sankong]. [Bai Sankong] stood up straight, with his hands crossed in front of his chest.
0:50:8|0:50:11|In the desert, [Fang Baoyu] stood up and stared at the broken boat. After hearing it, [Fang Baoyu] anxiously stood up to look for His Majesty.
0:50:43|0:50:48|[Fang Baoyu] listened, then turned around with a dejected look, staring blankly at the ground.
0:51:35|0:51:45|Previously, people in the martial arts world thought it was just a rumor, because the court didn't want the outside world to know about this news, which sparked a treasure hunt frenzy. But now Lord Huyan Dazang has a different idea.
0:52:58|0:53:5|His goal is to wipe out the martial arts community in the Central Plains. Whether it's the righteous sects or the evil sects,
0:53:29|0:53:34|That night, the children entered the cabin, and [Huyan Dazang] was sitting at the table.
0:54:33|0:54:51|[Huyan Dazang] looked deeply into the eyes of [Zhu'er], the candlelight reflecting on their faces. A faint smile appeared on Huyan Dazang's face. Dazang lowered his eyes slightly, while Zhu'er stared at his face and then also lowered her head.
0:55:21|0:55:30|Under the scorching sun in the desert, [Ben Yue] handed a steamed bun to [Fang Baoyu] sitting on a sand dune. [Fang Baoyu] turned his head and looked at [Ben Yue] beside him.
0:56:38|0:56:49|At this moment, [Fang Baoyu] furrowed his brow, staring angrily ahead. Later, [Fang Baoyu] walked past a teahouse with [Ben Yue] and [Duchess Tuo Chen]. The tea drinkers at the entrance were enjoying their tea.
0:57:3|0:57:20|Three people sat down randomly, and the shopkeeper poured tea for them. Then, as the shopkeeper turned to leave, [Fang Baoyu] suddenly looked at the shopkeeper's feet. At that moment, [Ben Yue] picked up a teacup to drink, but [Fang Baoyu] vigilantly stopped [Ben Yue].
0:58:1|0:58:18|In an instant, a hidden arrow shot out from the plate carried by the shop assistant, causing [Fang Baoyu] to dodge backwards. Immediately, the shop assistant drew a knife and stabbed towards [Fang Baoyu], who promptly evaded. Following that, the tea guests in the shop stood up one after another, took off their civilian clothes to reveal military uniforms, and the leader brandished a knife and charged towards [Fang Baoyu].
0:58:18|0:58:30|The soldiers rushed towards [Fang Baoyu] with knives in hand. [Fang Baoyu] swiftly turned and fell down, then flipped over and used his leg to trip another soldier. He wielded his arrows, blocking the incoming soldiers, his agile movements creating multiple shadows in the air.
0:58:31|0:58:38|[Fang Baoyu] shot an arrow and took down two soldiers. At that moment, [Mulang Shenjun] appeared and watched as [Fang Baoyu] aimed the arrow at the soldiers' necks.
0:58:46|0:58:50|In an instant, dozens of soldiers suddenly appeared at the door, standing behind [Mulang Shenjun].
0:58:53|0:58:57|[Fang Baoyu] widened his eyes, looking at the soldiers holding precious arrows in their hands, then stared at [Mulang Shenjun].
0:58:59|0:59:15|[Fang Baoyu] held a knife to the soldier's neck, [Mulang Shenjun] squinted at [Fang Baoyu]. [Fang Baoyu] stood still, staring at [Mulang Shenjun]. Then, he slowly loosened his grip on the knife, and the knife slipped from his hand.
0:59:29|0:59:45|[Mulang Shenjun] stood in the hall, looking towards the side with Duchess Tuo Chen. Then [Mulang Shenjun] turned around to face Duchess Tuo Chen, who also shifted her gaze to him, and the two locked eyes. With tears in his eyes, [Mulang Shenjun] gazed at Duchess Tuo Chen, then slowly walked towards her.
0:59:47|0:59:59|Mulang Shenjun slowly approached Duchess Tuo Chen and stood beside her. He turned his body slightly and looked at Duchess Tuo Chen, who was standing still, gazing straight ahead. Then, Mulang Shenjun bent down to untie Duchess Tuo Chen.
1:0:1|1:0:15|Duchess Tuo Chen lowered her eyes, tears welling up in them. Mulang Shenjun untied the rope bound to Duchess Tuo Chen's body from her head, and the two faced each other, with Duchess Tuo Chen looking weakly ahead. At this moment, Mulang Shenjun's concerned gaze appeared particularly warm.
1:0:15|1:0:21|Immediately, [Mulang Shenjun] supported [Duchess Tuo Chen]'s body, and [Duchess Tuo Chen] gazed into [Mulang Shenjun]'s eyes.
1:0:27|1:0:31|Duchess Tuo Chen, with tears in her eyes, furrowed her brow and then pushed Mulang Shenjun away.
1:0:43|1:1:6|It's late at night, [Fang Baoyu] is shackled and trapped in a small room. She gently nudges the stones under her feet, her eyes occasionally glancing forward. [Ben Yue] is also tied up, motionless. [Fang Baoyu] kicks a stone towards [Ben Yue], who catches it with her foot.
1:1:6|1:1:10|[Ben Yue] listened and lowered her eyes slightly, she rolled her eyeballs.
1:1:59|1:2:14|At that moment, [Bai Sankong] opened the door and walked in. Since early morning, [Huyan Dazang] and [Zhu'er] were walking on a narrow path with the abbess. [Huyan Dazang] carried a sword, and the group walked side by side.
1:2:22|1:2:27|After the Abbess finished speaking, she bowed to the two and left. The surrounding flowers and plants were lush, with a fragrant scent in the air.
1:2:31|1:2:44|Shortly after, Abbess also turned around with tears in her eyes to look at [Zhu'er]. Then, Abbess nodded slightly and walked away. [Zhu'er] stood in place, gazing at Abbess as she departed. A gentle breeze blew by, causing the willow trees around to tremble slightly.
1:2:44|1:2:51|Suddenly, [Huyan Dazang] turned sharply and drew his sword to block the flying crossbow bolt. Then, another sword flew past and struck [Zhu'er].
1:2:54|1:2:59|[Zhu'er] ran towards Reverend Mother crying, and [Huyan Dazang] immediately turned around and drew his sword.
1:3:12|1:3:17|[Wang Dian] took out a dagger and threw it on the ground, while [Zhu'er] looked down at the ground.
1:3:28|1:3:31|[Huyan Dazang] drew his sword and confronted [Wang Dian].
1:3:39|1:3:42|The abbess turned to look at the frowning [Zhu'er].
1:3:51|1:4:6|[Zhu'er] looked at [Huyan Dazang] with tears in her eyes, and [Huyan Dazang] sheathed his sword and stood up straight.
1:4:6|1:4:17|After the abbess committed suicide, [Huyan Dazang] immediately drew his sword and fought against [Wang Dian]. The swords of the two clashed continuously. [Wang Dian]'s men also stepped forward to fight. [Huyan Dazang] injured one of them and then leaped into the air.
1:4:19|1:4:32|[Huyan Dazang] fell from the sky and chopped down one of his subordinates. Suddenly, [Wang Dian] launched an attack. [Huyan Dazang] lifted his sword to defend against the assault. Then, he squatted on the ground, spun like a top, and swung his sword towards [Wang Dian].
1:4:36|1:4:47|[Wang Dian] was half crouched on the ground after being hit, then he stood up and fought back with all his strength. Seizing the opportunity, [Huyan Dazang] stomped on [Wang Dian]'s chest, sending him flying several meters away. Meanwhile, [Ben Yue] was kneeling beside the abbess.
1:4:55|1:5:6|[Wang Dian] soared into the air, landing a kick on the chest of [Huyan Dazang]. As he descended, he pressed closer, forcing [Huyan Dazang] to retreat repeatedly. In an instant, the two arrived beside [Duchess Tuo Chen] and the abbess.
1:5:6|1:5:12|At that moment, [Wang Dian] launched an attack towards [Huyan Dazang], who dodged to the side and caught [Wang Dian]'s sword with his own.
1:5:13|1:5:27|Shortly after, [Huyan Dazang] exerted force to lift upwards, and [Wang Dian]'s sword flew out of his hand in an instant. [Huyan Dazang] struck [Wang Dian]'s foot with the sword handle, knocking him to the ground, then pointing the sword at him as a large amount of blood sprayed from [Wang Dian]'s mouth.
1:5:31|1:5:37|As Huyan Dazang raised his sword towards Wang Dian's chest, Zhuer slowly stood up and walked towards Wang Dian.
1:6:17|1:6:30|[Zhu'er] turned and walked towards the distance, paused for a moment, and continued to leave. Inside the small house, the crystal-clear Qiongjiang jade leaves were poured into a cup, [Mulang Shenjun] picked up the cup and drank, while [Bai Sankong] stood aside.
1:7:18|1:7:34|Speak up, Bai Sankong, who was about to leave, stopped in his tracks and turned to look at Mulang Shenjun. Inside the Qingfeng An, Zhu'er was lighting incense and bowing respectfully to the abbess's wooden tablet. Next to the tablet were fruits and offerings, while outside, the sunlight shone in, giving off an especially cold feeling.
1:7:34|1:7:39|[Huyan Dazang] sat behind the table next to [Zhu Er], looking at [Zhu Er]. After [Zhu Er] lit the incense, she sat down next to [Huyan Dazang].
1:9:1|1:9:11|[Zhu'er] held [Huyan Dazang]'s hand, and a smile appeared on [Huyan Dazang]'s face. Meanwhile, [Fang Baoyu] was standing in the main hall, staring straight at [Mulang Shenjun].
1:9:28|1:9:48|As night fell, [Huyan Dazang] and [Wang Dian] hid in the bushes, secretly observing. On a distant hillside, a group of people were engaged in a fierce battle with swords. [Wang Dian] furrowed his brow, completely focused on the fight below.
1:9:48|1:9:54|Just as [Huyan Dazang] was about to investigate further, [Fang Baoyu] appeared from a distance with a covered face, wielding swords and knives, causing [Huyan Dazang] to halt in his tracks.
1:10:19|1:10:23|Shortly after, [Fang Baoyu], [Huyan Dazang], and [Ben Yue] arrived at an inn together.
1:10:39|1:10:54|[Huyan Dazang] raised his wine glass, [Fang Baoyu] smiled and clinked glasses with [Huyan Dazang]. Suddenly, a paper fell from the tree outside the door, and the three of them grabbed their swords and ran outside. [Fang Baoyu] went to pick up the paper, examined it, and stood at the door with [Huyan Dazang].
1:11:2|1:11:14|[Huyan Dazang] stared at the paper ball, while [Fang Baoyu] furrowed her brows in contemplation. On this day, within the military camp, [Ben Yue] was bound high on a pillar, with sharp swords and knives inserted into the ground below.
1:11:14|1:11:29|[Mulang Shenjun] was leisurely sipping tea while holding a teacup, with [Duchess Tuo Chen], [Bai Sankong], and others standing beside him, and soldiers standing in formation behind them. At this moment, [Huyan Dazang] and [Fang Baoyu] walked in side by side from the main gate. [Mulang Shenjun] set down the teacup and gazed at the approaching duo.
1:11:29|1:11:31|Half Moon's gaze followed closely behind [Fang Baoyu].
1:11:46|1:11:54|I ask you one last time, [Mulang Shenjun] looked expressionless and then bent forward.
1:11:56|1:12:9|The crowd looked over here one after another, [Ben Yue] anxiously gazing at [Fang Baoyu]. [Bai Sankong] and [Duchess Tuo Chen] also looked over. At that moment, [Mulang Shenjun] suddenly soared into the air and rushed towards [Fang Baoyu].
1:12:9|1:12:14|In an instant, the two drew their swords and engaged in a fierce struggle, with the surrounding soldiers also wielding their swords in battle.
1:12:15|1:12:26|At this moment, the swords of [Fang Baoyu] and [Mulang Shenjun] clashed, while behind them, [Bai Sankong] and [Huyan Dazang] also engaged in a fierce battle. [Huyan Dazang] and [Bai Sankong] faced each other palm to palm, then quickly separated.
1:12:31|1:12:44|At this moment, the two stepped back and quickly stood firm. Then, Bai Sankong swiftly rushed towards Huyan Dazang, who defended against the attack with his sword. Huyan Dazang then continuously wielded his sword, forcing Bai Sankong to retreat repeatedly.
1:12:44|1:12:51|At this moment, the soldiers on the side rushed towards [Huyan Dazang] with their swords. [Huyan Dazang] defended against the attack and cut down the soldiers one by one.
1:12:52|1:13:8|On the side, [Duchess Tuo Chen] and [Ben Yue] looked on anxiously. On the other side, [Fang Baoyu] kept flying up to attack Mulang. Just as [Fang Baoyu] launched an attack, Mulang soared into the air and stabbed towards [Fang Baoyu] with his sword. At that moment, [Fang Baoyu] leaned back, suspended in the air, narrowly avoiding the strike.
1:13:8|1:13:12|Immediately, she pushed off with her foot, maintaining a parallel position with Mulang and the others.
1:13:13|1:13:33|[Fang Baoyu] exerted force with his sword, separating from Mulang and standing still. Then, [Fang Baoyu] leaped into the air and swiftly landed next to Mulang. The two immediately drew their swords and faced each other. Mulang's strike was blocked by [Fang Baoyu]'s sword, then Mulang flew to the side while [Fang Baoyu] stood in place, holding his sword and watching Mulang.
1:13:33|1:13:39|Mulang stood up straight and looked down at his own body, then raised his head again. [Ben Yue] looked at them anxiously.
1:13:47|1:14:2|In an instant, Mulang clenched the knife in his hand and threw it towards Ben Yue. At that moment, a pair of sleeves blocked the flying knife aimed at Ben Yue, and Purple Marquis was flying in the air towards Ben Yue. He then cut the rope binding Ben Yue and rescued her.
1:14:2|1:14:12|Purple Marquis and Ben Yue landed on the ground, surrounded by soldiers pointing weapons at them. Yan Zhu knocked down a row of soldiers with his sleeve, and then Purple Marquis took down the incoming soldiers one by one with his sword.
1:14:13|1:14:34|[Purple Marquis] broke the wooden spears in the soldiers' hands and threw them aside, with the iron sword on the spear stabbing into another soldier's chest. At the same time, Yan Zhu used his sleeve to sweep up the swords and knives on the ground, then flung them towards the oncoming soldiers. The soldiers were immediately struck by the swords and knives, falling to the ground one after another.
1:14:34|1:14:42|While Bai Yanzhu was launching continuous attacks, Bai Sankong suddenly grabbed Yanzhu's sleeve tightly with his hand, then he extended his palm towards Yanzhu.
1:14:55|1:15:9|Yanzhu was knocked down to the ground, and [Purple Marquis] helped him up. At that moment, [Mulang Shenjun] rushed over and locked palms with [Purple Marquis]. [Purple Marquis] trembled, while [Mulang Shenjun] had a fierce look in his eyes. Then, [Purple Marquis] leaned back and spat out blood.
1:15:14|1:15:35|[Fang Baoyu] ran over with [Ben Yue], and the soldiers swarmed in. [Huyan Dazang] and others turned and ran towards the door. At this moment, the soldiers from Chengban caught up from behind, and the group fled in a huddle. The soldiers pursued closely, and hundreds of arrows were shot towards [Huyan Dazang] and the others.
1:15:40|1:15:58|Duchess Tuo Chen flew down from the eaves and stood in front of the soldiers. At that moment, Mulang Shenjun arrived from the back of the troops and gazed at Duchess Tuo Chen who was standing still. Duchess Tuo Chen also looked quietly at him. Afterwards, Purple Marquis helped the Duchess of Yan to a desolate plain near a broken dam.
1:16:20|1:16:26|The Purple Marquis embraces Yan Zhu, just as Bai Yanzhu walks in.
1:16:53|1:17:4|The Marquis of Zi Yi put away the drawn sword and then left. Yan Zhu leaned weakly against a pillar, with [Bai Sankong] standing in front of him, gazing at him.
1:17:18|1:17:20|Could it be your son [Fang Baoyu]?
1:18:9|1:18:20|[Bai Sankong] took out a bottle from his clothes and placed it in front of Yan Zhu. Yan Zhu sat there motionless, leaning weakly against the chair, with tears shimmering in his eyes.
1:19:11|1:19:18|[Purple Marquis] held Yan Zhu beside him and nodded to signal Yan Zhu.
1:20:12|1:20:16|The jade pendant is a family heirloom of Huyan Dazang.
1:21:1|1:21:19|Huyan Dazang turned and left, leaving Yan Zhu behind. Tears gushed from Yan Zhu's eyes, and Duchess Tuo Chen came to hold Yan Zhu's shoulders. Tears continued to fall from Yan Zhu's face as she kept her eyes on the direction Huyan Dazang had left.
1:21:19|1:21:28|At the same time, [Bai Sankong] was waving his hands, playing with Qin Xian, who kept dancing, while [Mulang Shenjun] sat on the side drinking tea.
1:21:32|1:21:42|Shortly after, [Bai Sankong] listened to the movements in his hand, raised his eyes and stared straight at [Mulang Shenjun]. [Mulang Shenjun] slowly walked forward and stood directly in front of [Bai Sankong].
1:22:18|1:22:38|He gently plucked the strings of the qin. Immediately, Mulang Shenjun's clothes were marked with a cut. Then, Mulang Shenjun and Bai Sankong locked eyes. Following that, Bai Sankong continued to wave his fingers and started playing the qin. As the strings vibrated, Mulang Shenjun's clothes were torn again.
1:22:38|1:22:46|Mulang Shenjun looked down at his clothes, then glanced at Bai Sankong. Bai Sankong's movements intensified, and with a wave of his hands, the hemp rope on the pillar instantly broke.
1:23:33|1:23:49|As soon as the words fell, the two pressed their hands on the zither, then raised their arms and clashed together. After their hands touched and were pushed apart, one hand slapped the table, causing the ancient zither to fly up. The two then fought under the suspended ancient zither.
1:23:49|1:23:59|Shortly after, [Bai Sankong] hugged the ancient qin and plucked the strings, causing the strings to burst out. [Mulang Shenjun] flew backwards as the strings cut through the flagpole. [Mulang Shenjun] then grabbed the flagpole and threw it towards [Bai Sankong].
1:23:59|1:24:12|[Bai Sankong] supported his body with the qin, Mulang Shenjun slapped the qin away with one palm, [Bai Sankong] caught the qin again and started playing. The waves produced by the qin strings shattered the wooden table, Mulang Shenjun hung in the air, and [Bai Sankong] kept pressing on the qin strings.
1:24:22|1:24:34|In an instant, Mulang flew upwards, blocking Bai Sankong's string attack with one hand. Bai Sankong vigorously danced the strings, sending Mulang flying and his sleeves instantly torn to pieces.
1:24:43|1:25:0|[Bai Sankong] kept waving the strings of the zither, at this moment, Mulan stepped forward and pushed the ancient zither. Mulan beside her was all knocked away, suddenly, Mulang reached back with one hand, and Mulin behind him was instantly shattered into two halves. [Bai Sankong] stared at Mulang with widened eyes, blood slowly seeping out of his ears.
1:25:0|1:25:8|Shortly after, Mulang exerted force and the ancient qin instantly turned into pieces. At that moment, Mulang suddenly exerted force and sent [Bai Sankong] flying into the air.
1:25:48|1:25:58|Bai Sankong's mouth kept spewing out a large amount of blood, Fang Baoyu held Bai Sankong in his arms, at this moment Yan Zhu slowly walked to the bedside, tears welled up in Yan Zhu's eyes.
1:26:14|1:26:18|Bai Sankong slowly reached out his hand, Yan Zhu, tears streaming down her face, went to hold Bai Sankong's hand.
1:26:32|1:26:42|On this day, [Fang Baoyu] stood in front of [Mulang Shenjun] with a frown on his face. Just as he rushed forward with his sword, four iron spears shot out from the floorboards, and [Fang Baoyu] managed to cut off one of them.
1:26:42|1:26:49|Immediately, several burly soldiers rushed onto the wooden bridge, surrounding [Fang Baoyu], with dozens of iron spears pointed at [Fang Baoyu]'s neck.
1:26:50|1:27:9|Soldiers surrounded [Fang Baoyu] in circles. [Fang Baoyu] remained calm and composed. In an instant, he raised his sword and charged towards the soldiers. Dozens of iron spears followed, attacking [Fang Baoyu]. He leaped up, and the soldiers thrust their spears upwards. [Fang Baoyu] landed lightly, perfectly balanced on the tip of a spear, before gracefully stepping off.
1:27:9|1:27:20|He launched attacks on the soldiers one by one with his sword, knocking the surrounding soldiers off the wooden bridge, causing them to fall heavily to the ground. [Fang Baoyu] turned around to look at [Mulang Shenjun], who raised his sword and charged towards [Fang Baoyu].
1:27:20|1:27:31|[Fang Baoyu] dodged and engaged in a fierce fight with [Mulang Shenjun], both wielding swords and moving swiftly. Just as [Mulang Shenjun] was about to step onto the wooden bridge, the plank beneath his feet suddenly broke.
1:27:31|1:27:44|Following that, a hole appeared in the wooden bridge, and [Mulang Shenjun] urgently flew high into the air, landing on the wooden steps behind. [Fang Baoyu] focused his gaze and saw [Huyan Dazang] standing below, holding a sword on the broken wooden plank, then raised his head to look at [Fang Baoyu].
1:27:45|1:27:58|[Huyan Dazang] stepped on the wooden board under his feet, and the board immediately flipped up and landed on the bridge pillar. [Huyan Dazang] walked onto the bridge on the board, standing side by side with [Fang Baoyu] in front of them, both holding swords and facing [Mulang Shenjun] across the bridge. At that moment, [Mulang Shenjun] also raised his sword.
1:28:2|1:28:14|With a shout, [Mulang Shenjun] from across suddenly raised his bow and dashed forward. Flying towards the two behind, [Huyan Dazang] and [Fang Baoyu] immediately turned around, facing the arrow techniques displayed by [Mulang Shenjun].
1:28:14|1:28:27|Three people on the bridge kept waving arrows, [Mulang Shenjun] flew up and kicked towards [Fang Baoyu]. [Fang Baoyu] lowered his body to dodge. Then, [Fang Baoyu] and [Huyan Dazang] launched an attack towards [Mulang Shenjun] together, [Mulang Shenjun] leaped up again, avoiding the attack.
1:28:27|1:28:34|Under the scorching sun, three individuals kept spinning on the bridge, their swords clashing together, their silhouettes gradually elongated by the sun.
1:28:37|1:28:48|[Fang Baoyu] kept attacking [Mulang Shenjun], both of them moving swiftly, with each attack being blocked by [Mulang Shenjun]. [Huyan Dazang] spun the sword in his hand and then charged towards the two.
1:28:48|1:29:2|[Huyan Dazang] squatted on the ground in an instant, spinning like a top, then he raised his sword above his head and quickly charged towards [Mulang Shenjun]. The Wolf Sword clashed, quickly dodged, then [Huyan Dazang] leaped behind Mulang, who immediately turned around to face [Huyan Dazang].
1:29:2|1:29:5|[Huyan Dazang] holds a sword against Mulang's chest, as Mulang stands still.
1:29:6|1:29:14|At that moment, [Huyan Dazang] tore Mulang's clothes, then together with [Fang Baoyu], they kicked Mulang's abdomen, causing him to stagger back.
1:29:14|1:29:23|Following that, [Fang Baoyu] and [Huyan Dazang] together thrust their swords towards the abdomen of Mulang. The sword in Mulang's hand was knocked off, and at the same time, Mulang was pinned against a pillar by the two swords.
1:29:24|1:29:39|He hung precariously on the pillar. Then, [Fang Baoyu] and [Huyan Dazang] worked together to forcefully remove the golden silk armor from Mulang's clothes. At this moment, Mulang hid behind the guards and then pushed them, one by one, towards [Huyan Dazang] and [Fang Baoyu].
1:29:39|1:29:47|[Huyan Dazang] and [Fang Baoyu] encountered one and killed one, sending the soldier rolling off the bridge. Then two more soldiers approached, and [Fang Baoyu] and [Huyan Dazang] stabbed the approaching soldiers with a single blow.
1:29:51|1:30:3|As the two slowly moved the bodies of the soldiers in front of their eyes with swords in hand, Mulang Shenjun appeared in front of them, only a foot away. Then, when Mulang Shenjun struck towards their chests with his palm, Huyan Dazang and Fang Baoyu both frowned.
1:30:3|1:30:10|Immediately, [Mulang Shenjun] turned his palm and pushed hard, sending [Huyan Dazang] and [Fang Baoyu] flying out, then falling heavily to the ground.
1:30:11|1:30:26|At this moment, [Mulang Shenjun] took the opportunity to pull out [Huyan Dazang]'s sword from the soldier's body, staining [Fang Baoyu]'s face with blood. [Fang Baoyu] widened his eyes, staring at [Mulang Shenjun] holding the sword in front of him. There was a hint of joy in [Mulang Shenjun]'s eyes, while [Huyan Dazang] watched quietly from the side.
1:30:26|1:30:38|Afterwards, [Mulang Shenjun] held a sword in his hand, with a slight smile on his face, slowly approaching [Huyan Dazang] and [Fang Baoyu] in front of him. [Huyan Dazang] was half-lying on the ground, unable to move while clutching his chest. [Fang Baoyu] kept retreating backwards, looking in horror at everything in front of him.
1:30:38|1:30:49|[Mulang Shenjun] held the sword, step by step getting closer, the blade still stained with fresh blood. [Mulang Shenjun] raised his arms and waved the sword, then gripped the hilt with both hands, staring straight ahead.
1:30:53|1:31:5|Just as [Mulang Shenjun] was about to stab down with his sword, [Duchess Tuo Chen] suddenly flew in from behind. She thrust a knife into [Mulang Shenjun]'s back, leaving him stunned in place with his sword hand held high above his head.
1:31:5|1:31:16|Later, [Mulang Shenjun] slowly lowered his head, at this moment, [Duchess Tuo Chen] frowned tightly, gripping the knife that was stabbed into [Mulang Shenjun]'s body, as drops of blood slowly dripped from the blade.
1:31:21|1:31:26|Suddenly, Duchess Tuo Chen pulled out the knife and threw it on the ground, causing Mulang Shenjun to clutch his waist and abdomen in pain.
1:31:29|1:31:44|At this moment, [Mulang Shenjun] blinked his eyes, the veins on his forehead and neck bulging, slowly turning his head. Tears moistened Mulang Shenjun's eyes, while Duchess Tuo Chen also frowned, tears continuously flowing from her eyes.
1:31:44|1:31:55|[Mulang Shenjun] fell heavily to the ground, and immediately [Duchess Tuo Chen] embraced him tightly. At this moment, [Fang Baoyu] got up and sat next to [Mulang Shenjun], staring wide-eyed at [Duchess Tuo Chen].
1:32:31|1:32:43|Duchess Tuo Chen picked up a dagger and stabbed Mulang Shenjun's body. Huyan Dazang and Fang Baoyu both widened their eyes. Duchess Tuo Chen trembled as she held the slowly stiffening Mulang Shenjun in her arms, while Huyan Dazang furrowed his brow and watched from the side.
1:32:43|1:32:50|Afterwards, [Mulang Shenjun] slowly slipped from the embrace of [Duchess Tuo Chen] and fell straight onto the cold ground.
1:33:1|1:33:15|Speaking, [Huyan Dazang] drew his sword, and [Fang Baoyu] did the same, standing on the river bank facing each other with their blades drawn. The river breeze rustled the surrounding reeds, causing [Huyan Dazang]'s hair to sway in the wind, while [Fang Baoyu]'s clothes fluttered slightly.
