0:2:10|0:2:23|[Ye Xun] impatiently hung up the phone in her hand. She was tall and slender, dressed in an evening gown with delicate makeup. Not far away, the male lead [Huang Da] also hung up the phone, and with just one glance, he saw [Ye Xun].
0:2:23|0:2:38|Compared to [Ye Xun], he is wearing an unironed suit with a dark floral short-sleeved shirt underneath. He looks up and down at [Ye Xun], who feels his gaze and turns to stare at him blankly.
0:3:7|0:3:14|After finishing their conversation, the two of them turned around and left. [Huang Da] sat face to face with his blind date at the dining table.
0:3:28|0:3:40|[Ye Xun] also met her blind date Zhao Yongge at this time. The waiter poured a glass of wine for each of them. Zhao Yongge propped his head with one hand, pointed at the wine glass with the other hand, and said in English: Miss Ye, please enjoy. Let's see if you like it.
0:5:20|0:5:35|His phone suddenly rang, and Zhao Yongge finished speaking to [Ye Xun], then turned and left the table. [Ye Xun] smiled and picked up the phone.
0:6:32|0:6:40|[Huang Da] sat back at the dining table, and a phone rang in the private room where [Ye Xun] was.
0:7:2|0:7:8|Just as he finished speaking, a woman passed by [Huang Da], looking around and searching for something.
0:7:18|0:7:32|As soon as Zhao Yongge finished speaking, he immediately used the magazine on the table to cover his face. The woman who had been looking around crossed her hands in front of her chest and walked towards him. It turned out to be Zhao Yongge's wife, who sat down next to him and Zhao Yongge put down the magazine in front of him.
0:9:42|0:9:51|Mrs. Zhao grabbed a snack and hit [Huang Da], who tasted it and stood on the snack with his hair.
0:9:56|0:10:8|[Huang Da] took [Ye Xun]'s hand and left the scene. They walked through the restaurant lobby to the elevator, where [Huang Da] slowly let go of [Ye Xun]'s hand. [Ye Xun] smiled and took out a tissue to wipe away the dessert crumbs from his face.
0:11:30|0:11:37|[Huang Da] took out a notebook from his jacket pocket and flipped through the pages, reading the words written on them.
0:12:23|0:12:37|[Ye Xun] held the steering wheel and excitedly talked while looking at the road ahead, while [Huang Da] sat silently in the passenger seat watching her. Seeing that [Huang Da] did not respond to her, [Ye Xun] awkwardly withdrew her smile, and then pressed the button in the car to play music.
0:12:43|0:12:58|Upon hearing Huang Da's words, Ye Xun once again put away her smile, focusing on the road ahead. For the rest of the journey, the two of them did not speak again. Ye Xun's car drove into an old residential area, and after the car stopped, Huang Da got out. Ye Xun rolled down the car window.
0:12:58|0:13:17|Called out to Huang Da who was about to leave. After a brief greeting, Ye Xun drove out of the neighborhood, leaving Huang Da standing in place watching her leave. At this moment, three people rushed out from behind him, following his gaze.
0:13:57|0:14:8|After finishing their conversation, the four of them walked towards the apartment building, laughing. Before they could enter, the sound of a car came from behind. [Huang Da] walked towards the car in a daze.
0:14:36|0:14:52|Early the next morning, [Ye Xun] arrived at the Shanghai Art Center. She was wearing a dark long dress, sitting in the empty venue with her cello placed between her legs. Her left hand pressed on the strings, while her right hand pulled the bow.
0:14:55|0:15:13|In front of them, several people listened carefully to the music played by [Ye Xun]. The music sounded somewhat sad, and [Ye Xun]'s thoughts drifted back to three years ago, back to the day of her own wedding. She was wearing a pure white wedding dress, silently waiting for a man on the hotel balcony.
0:15:13|0:15:25|In Ye Xun's memory, a man is sitting on a bus, but the bus overturns, causing an accident. Ye Xun, who is waiting silently at the wedding scene, still hasn't seen the man arrive.
0:15:25|0:15:43|That day, the guests were in high spirits, the wedding scene was elegantly decorated, with tables filled with red wine and roses. [Ye Xun] carried her long wedding dress and ran outside, wiping away the tears that couldn't help but fall as she ran, and she disappeared into the distance under the gaze of family and friends.
0:15:43|0:15:50|As the final note of the music fell, [Ye Xun]'s thoughts were also brought back to reality, and a luxury car pulled up at the entrance of the Shanghai Art Center.
0:15:54|0:16:6|The car almost hit the pedestrians walking at the entrance. After the car stopped, a man got out of it. The man was wearing a suit and leather shoes. It was only after getting out of the car that he realized the person he went on a blind date with last night was [Ye Xun].
0:16:6|0:16:12|At this moment, a luxurious car stopped next to an old low-end car, and [Huang Da] stepped out wearing a checkered shirt.
0:16:36|0:16:44|After Huang Da finished speaking, he walked into the art center. Ye Xun carried her cello into the hall and ran into her best friend Taozi.
0:19:35|0:19:42|After speaking, [Huang Da] turned and walked towards the nearby ATM. He put the money in his bag and found his colleagues who had come with him.
0:19:43|0:19:52|Three colleagues gathered around him, then opened the bag and took out money to share with the three colleagues.
0:21:18|0:21:24|[Ye Xun] took out her phone and pressed the play button towards Zhao Yongge.
0:21:53|0:21:57|[Huang Da], [Taozi] and others arrived at the night market, where [Taozi] pulled [Ye Xun] aside.
0:24:18|0:24:32|[Ye Xun] blurted out everything she wanted to say, only to realize that her words were inappropriate. She immediately stopped, got up from the table, and left in her car with tears in her eyes, her mind drifting back to the past.
0:24:32|0:24:46|In her memory, she looked at the man in front of her with a happy face, while on the other side, the dinner with Huang Da and others in the night market had already ended. Taozi, wearing high heels, walked out of the bumpy alley in the night market, with Huang Da following behind her.
0:24:54|0:25:5|A taxi suddenly arrived behind, but a man got in first, leaving [Taozi] with a hint of anger in her eyes. She watched the taxi leave fiercely.
0:25:18|0:25:24|[Taozi], with the anger from earlier still in her voice, suddenly realized that what she said might have been inappropriate, and stopped in her tracks.
0:26:2|0:26:8|Another taxi drove away, [Taozi] looked at the car leaving again, turned around and said to [Huang Da]:
0:26:24|0:26:42|One day, [Xu Zhuo] brought [Ye Xun] to the seaside. He slowly removed the cloth in front of [Ye Xun's] eyes, then took out a gift box from his pocket. He knelt down on the beach, opened the gift box, and held it in front of [Ye Xun] with both hands, looking at her affectionately.
0:26:55|0:27:1|After speaking, he took out something from the gift box and placed it in [Ye Xun]'s hand.
0:27:6|0:27:15|[Ye Xun] lowered her head shyly and smiled, then nestled in [Xu Zhuo]'s arms. After [Xu Zhuo] passed away, [Ye Xun] would always reminisce about him, shedding tears silently alone.
0:28:30|0:28:41|[Taozi] stopped a taxi while talking, then quickly got in and left. [Huang Da] stood alone in place.
0:28:48|0:29:4|After returning home, [Huang Da] sat on the bed looking out the window, recalling the words [Ye Xun] said at the dinner table. He then went to the Shanghai Art Center, where [Ye Xun] was squatting on the ground packing the cello into a bag. [Huang Da] found her, carrying a bag in each hand as he walked in.
0:29:25|0:29:33|[Huang Da] opens the bag in his hand, [Ye Xun] places the ice cream handed to her by [Huang Da] on the piano, and then looks into the bag.
0:29:35|0:29:43|[Ye Xun] grabbed a lottery ticket and froze, while [Huang Da] grinned foolishly at her.
0:31:46|0:32:2|[Ye Xun] heard what he said, slowly raised her head to look at him, [Huang Da] also looked at [Ye Xun], his eyes reluctant to leave. The two of them looked at each other like this, and [Ye Xun]'s sudden question left [Huang Da] stunned.
0:32:4|0:32:22|Huang Da, who had regained his composure, thought for a moment and said, Ye Xun picked up the lottery ticket in her hand. Huang Da took the ticket from her hand with one hand, and with the other hand, he compared the numbers on the ticket with those in the prize-winning newspaper. After confirming the numbers, he first opened his mouth in surprise, then turned to look at Ye Xun smiling beside him. When he got home, ...
0:32:22|0:32:32|[Huang Da] squats on the ground, takes out a book from under the chair and throws it aside, then steadies the chair and puts on a pair of dark high-heeled shoes with thick heels, placing one foot on the stool.
0:32:32|0:32:51|Then he took out a tape measure and carefully measured the height of the high heels. His coworkers hid outside the door watching him. After measuring the length of the high heels, [Huang Da] sat on a chair and fiddled with them. The next day, [Taozi] went to find [Ye Xun].
0:32:55|0:33:3|[Ye Xun] is fiddling with her cello. [Taozi] glanced at the ringing phone again.
0:33:15|0:33:19|[Taozi] puts down what she is holding and rushes towards the phone not far away.
0:34:56|0:35:3|After finishing speaking, he walked out of the house under renovation. The next night, he showed up at the party as [Ye Xun] had mentioned, wearing a simple shirt.
0:35:51|0:35:58|The foreigner asked [Ye Xun] if he is also a musician. [Ye Xun] replied that [Huang Da] is an architect and denied that [Huang Da] is her boyfriend.
0:36:21|0:36:26|Shortly after, the group raised their glasses of red wine together, toasted each other, and took a few sips.
0:36:28|0:36:34|[Huang Da], with his bag in his arms, awkwardly holds up his wine glass. After putting down the glass, [Ye Xun] asks the foreigner, "When are you going on your honeymoon?"
0:36:38|0:36:50|The foreigners expressed their intention to get married first and then go on a honeymoon in Europe, continuing to communicate with each other. [Huang Da] suddenly stood up, slinging the bag over his shoulder. [Ye Xun] nodded in agreement to his request and then started chatting with the friend across from her.
0:36:50|0:37:8|[Huang Da] walked around the table and headed towards the other side. [Ye Xun] watched him getting farther and farther away, looking puzzled in the direction he left. [Huang Da] walked to a distant open compartment with a small swimming pool in the middle, where people were wearing swimsuits. He stood among them, and a woman beside him recognized someone.
0:37:10|0:37:22|[Huang Da] quietly walked to the side of the door after seeing it, leaning against the door and pursing his lips as he looked at the people around him. [Ye Xun] walked to his side, hesitated for a moment, and then said to him:
0:37:31|0:37:44|[Ye Xun] finished speaking and then turned around to leave. [Huang Da] awkwardly smiled, his face darkening as he watched [Ye Xun] walk away. He then left the bar scene. [Ye Xun] returned to the table and continued listening to the foreigner telling his story.
0:37:44|0:37:55|[Ye Xun] listened happily to the foreigner with one hand supporting her head, slowly thinking of [Huang Da]. The smile on her face gradually returned to calm, and then she got up and walked out of the tavern.
0:38:5|0:38:27|[Ye Xun] smiled at him, then the two walked outside together. Once they were in the elevator, neither of them spoke, each staring at a corner of the elevator in silence for a long time. Breaking the silence, [Ye Xun] asked [Huang Da], who grabbed his left wrist with his right hand and looked at [Ye Xun] before saying:
0:38:33|0:38:47|He nervously licked his lower lip, his hand gripping his wrist tightened involuntarily, he swallowed saliva again, [Ye Xun] couldn't help but laugh, and [Huang Da] laughed along.
0:38:51|0:39:11|[Ye Xun] brought [Huang Da] to her home. She walked into the kitchen, boiled water, and put a pack of instant noodles into the pot. [Huang Da] sat on the sofa in the living room, looking around [Ye Xun]'s house. After cooking the noodles, [Ye Xun] carried the bowl out of the kitchen and handed it to [Huang Da].
0:39:33|0:39:39|[Ye Xun] chuckled and did not give him a direct answer.
0:39:48|0:39:55|[Ye Xun] got up from the sofa and walked towards the second floor. After a while, he came downstairs and handed something to [Huang Da].
0:40:45|0:41:7|After that day, the distance between [Huang Da] and [Ye Xun] got closer. When Huang Da is free, he would accompany Ye Xun to the Shanghai Art Center to practice the piano. While Ye Xun played the violin, he would sometimes write or draw on the side, sometimes squatting next to Ye Xun, measuring her height. After many days of contact, the distance between the two of them grew closer.
0:41:7|0:41:26|[Ye Xun] will drink and chat with [Huang Da] at the night market, and [Huang Da] will also accompany [Ye Xun] to do yoga on the grass in the early morning. When they return home at night, he will sit in a chair wearing high heels, using a painting easel as a cello, playing with it, and drawing various chairs with different shapes on the blackboard, repeatedly modifying them on the drawing paper.
0:41:26|0:41:42|The three roommates who lived together saw his strange behavior and expressed their incomprehension, often peeking at him from outside the door. One night, he was wearing high heels as usual, sitting on a chair playing with something in his hand, when suddenly a noise interrupted him. He looked up towards the door.
0:42:27|0:42:36|Two workers carrying renovation materials walk downstairs, while [Ye Xun] walks upstairs with her skirt held up, lightly touching the wall with one hand, listening carefully to [Huang Da]'s voice, with a smile on her face.
0:42:45|0:42:56|Following the singing of [Huang Da], [Ye Xun] found him. [Huang Da] was tinkering with the sewer in the bathroom. [Ye Xun] listened outside the door for a while, then walked into the bathroom and knocked on the door of the shower room.
0:43:15|0:43:24|[Huang Da] took off his construction gloves and led [Ye Xun] to the corridor outside the bathroom.
0:44:35|0:44:52|[Huang Da] was speaking joyfully, but [Ye Xun]'s face gradually darkened. Scenes of [Xu Zhuo] proposing to her by the seaside kept flashing in her mind. She closed her eyes, then opened them and walked downstairs without looking back. [Huang Da] watched her leave, stunned for a moment before following in [Ye Xun]'s footsteps.
0:44:52|0:44:58|The sky has turned dark, and two people are walking on the sidewalk. [Huang Da] hesitated but eventually spoke up.
0:45:12|0:45:18|[Ye Xun] coldly rejected him and continued walking forward on her own. Unwillingly, [Huang Da] asked again:
0:45:30|0:45:41|After speaking, [Ye Xun] turned and walked forward, while [Huang Da] stood still for a moment, then quickly caught up.
0:46:28|0:46:34|[Ye Xun] finished speaking, [Huang Da] pursed his lips, swallowed, then turned and ran towards the middle of the road.
0:46:48|0:47:12|[Ye Xun] listened to his words and tears streamed down her face. A truck coming towards them almost hit [Huang Da]. The truck driver managed to brake in time, leaving only a fist's distance between the truck and [Huang Da]. [Ye Xun] was so scared that she didn't move a muscle, and the truck drove away as [Huang Da] pointed at it.
0:47:14|0:47:29|[Ye Xun] lowered her eyes to calm down from the previous emotions, she raised her red eyes and looked at [Huang Da], slowly saying: [Huang Da] stood still and looked at her, [Ye Xun] ignored him and walked forward with her head down.
0:47:29|0:47:44|[Huang Da] didn't chase after her anymore. He stood still and watched [Ye Xun] walk away, then squatted down by the side of the road. After [Ye Xun] had taken a few steps, tears welled up in her eyes again, and tears streamed down her cheeks, her emotions gradually collapsing.
0:47:44|0:47:56|From silent crying at the beginning to later sobbing, [Huang Da] squatted on the side of the road and started to weep. He watched [Ye Xun] walk away little by little, and he stayed by the roadside for a long time, not returning to his place until midnight.
0:47:56|0:48:11|Early the next morning, [Taozi] arrived at [Ye Xun]'s house. She casually browsed through the books on the shelf while [Ye Xun] was downstairs holding a potted plant. After setting down the book on the second floor, [Taozi] spoke to her.
0:49:23|0:49:40|[Ye Xun] finished tidying up and went to the Shanghai Art Center. She sat in a chair, absentmindedly drawing musical notes, pondering [Taozi]'s words repeatedly. After checking the watch on her wrist, she quietly went to [Taozi]'s bridal shop.
0:49:40|0:49:46|The shop assistant is taking inventory of wedding dresses, while [Ye Xun] looks around at the customers in the store. The assistant notices her.
0:50:45|0:50:58|[Huang Da]’s friends walked out of the fitting room after trying on wedding dresses. She almost stumbled in her high heels, but [Huang Da] quickly caught her. [Ye Xun] stood not far away, hands on hips, angrily watching the two of them.
0:51:55|0:52:0|[Taozi] hurriedly pulled [Ye Xun] away.
0:52:58|0:53:4|The script is written in Chinese characters with Japanese homophones. After a while, a man in a suit walked in.
0:53:34|0:53:42|The camera automatically starts playing a clip that Huang Da secretly filmed of Ye Xun, which surprises the Japanese person who watches it.
0:54:4|0:54:25|The Japanese man took out a wallet from his shirt pocket, opened it, and showed [Huang Da] a photo of him and his beautiful wife inside. He pointed to himself and then to the wife in the photo, indicating the age gap between them, encouraging [Huang Da] to work hard and giving him a thumbs up. In the evening, after [Ye Xun]'s performance ended, she carried her cello and ran towards the location where the Japanese man was.
0:54:40|0:54:47|[Huang Da] quickly got up and took the cello off her, [Ye Xun] took off her bag and sat on the chair, [Huang Da] sat on the chair behind [Ye Xun].
0:56:12|0:56:18|But over 20 years have passed, and my wife has still aged just like me.
0:56:28|0:56:47|[Ye Xun] hands one end of the scarf to [Huang Da], and they each pull on their respective corners. The Japanese person says that if the scarf is spread out to look at, the two of you will have to move further apart. Then, [Ye Xun] is asked to fold the scarf, and it is mentioned that in order to fold the scarf nicely, the hands of the two people must be held together. Looking at their own hand holding [Huang Da]'s hand, [Ye Xun] falls into contemplation. The Japanese person earnestly says:
0:57:20|0:57:32|The next day, the Japanese left China. [Ye Xun] received a call from him in the car, asking him to take care of himself and bidding him farewell. After hanging up the phone, she looked at the notebook of [Huang Da] from last night.
0:57:43|0:57:52|The two drove to the nearby beach.
0:57:54|0:58:10|After getting off the car, [Ye Xun] ran towards the seaside, with [Huang Da] following closely behind. The sea breeze blew [Ye Xun]'s long hair as they reached the coast together. Standing side by side, [Ye Xun] gazed at the distant sea.
0:58:10|0:58:30|Faced with the sudden question from [Ye Xun], [Huang Da] fell into contemplation. [Ye Xun] looked up at the sky, while [Huang Da] exhaled a breath from his chest and then took out a box from his jacket pocket. Glancing at it, [Ye Xun] opened the box and took out a ring.
0:58:44|0:58:58|[Huang Da] stood up and looked at the ring in his hand, then started to fiddle with it. [Ye Xun] turned around with her back facing him. [Huang Da] threw the ring into the sea, and upon hearing the sound, [Ye Xun] turned to look at him.
0:58:59|0:59:8|She looked down at [Huang Da]'s hand holding the ring, walked over and grabbed his hand, then grabbed the other hand.
0:59:17|0:59:31|Upon hearing the amount of 20,000, [Ye Xun] stood still in place, then ran towards the beach where [Huang Da] had just lost the ring, carefully searching for it with her head down. Her high heels were also stuck in the muddy sand of the beach, but she didn't care to put them back on before running off to another place.
0:59:40|0:59:47|[Huang Da] smiled without saying a word, [Ye Xun] helplessly lowered her head and continued searching, unable to resist continuing to complain:
0:59:56|1:0:20|[Huang Da] hesitated for a moment, then pursed his lips and said to her, "Ye Xun, um..." Ye Xun paused in her search for the ring, slowly straightened up, avoiding [Huang Da]'s gaze, and looked to the side. Then she turned her head slowly to look at [Huang Da], hesitated for a moment, and finally said to him, "..."
1:0:24|1:0:33|After receiving affirmation from [Ye Xun] once again, [Huang Da] suddenly became energized, turning around and carefully searching for the ring. Suddenly, he looked up as if he had seen something.
1:0:36|1:0:53|[Huang Da] hurried over to pick up something from the beach, [Ye Xun] saw him holding the object motionless, and quickly ran to his side. She laughed when she saw the bolt that [Huang Da] picked up, took it from his hand, and smiled at him.
1:1:29|1:1:56|[Huang Da] watched as [Ye Xun]'s smile gradually faded, [Ye Xun] looked at him with a smile, the two of them gazing deeply at each other. [Huang Da]'s lips parted slightly, and [Ye Xun] couldn't help but take a small step forward. At that moment, her phone suddenly rang. She quickly opened her bag to find her phone, while [Huang Da] let out a deep sigh. [Ye Xun] took out her phone, glanced at the screen to see the caller ID, and answered the call.
1:1:56|1:2:12|On the phone, after hearing what was said, [Ye Xun] turned pale and stood frozen in place, not uttering a word. The phone slipped from her ear, and she turned to say:
1:2:28|1:2:45|[Huang Da] parked the car by the side of the road and slowly stopped. [Ye Xun] opened the door and got out from the passenger seat, then walked around to the driver's side from the back of the car. [Huang Da] got out from the driver's seat. Without even looking at him, [Ye Xun] directly sat down, closed the door, and left.
1:2:45|1:2:53|[Huang Da] stood alone on the roadside, watching the car drive away. [Ye Xun] arrived at the airport, anxiously searching for something at the international flight exit.
1:3:0|1:3:5|At this moment, [Ye Xun]'s eyes were already red, filled with tears in the eye sockets.
1:3:5|1:3:25|Just then, [Xu Zhuo] suddenly appeared in her sight. [Xu Zhuo], wearing a leather jacket and dragging a suitcase, stood not far away looking at [Ye Xun]. When [Ye Xun] saw [Xu Zhuo], tears streamed down her face. The two ran towards each other and embraced. [Ye Xun] cried in [Xu Zhuo]'s arms, while [Xu Zhuo] gently stroked her head.
1:3:25|1:3:29|The two of them then released the embrace, but still couldn't bear to separate, leaning their heads against each other and looking at each other.
1:4:24|1:4:36|[Huang Da] dropped the documents, then walked out of the room and sat on the stairs outside. After [Taozi] walked out of the room, she saw him, leaned on the railing of the stairs, thought for a moment, and then said to [Huang Da] sitting on the stairs.
1:4:53|1:5:20|[Huang Da] looked downstairs, then turned to look upstairs at [Taozi]. [Taozi] smiled at him and said, "After finishing speaking, she let go of the railing, turned around and went back into the room. After a while, [Huang Da] returned to his room, leaning on the window to look at the scene outside. He then turned to look at the things he made for [Ye Xun].
1:5:21|1:5:30|The next morning, [Ye Xun] and [Xu Zhuo] were running on the sidewalk in their sportswear. After running for a while, they sat down on nearby chairs to rest.
1:5:31|1:5:37|[Ye Xun] smiled wearily, nodded slightly, and then looked at [Xu Zhuo].
1:5:40|1:5:51|[Ye Xun] put away her smile, she didn't say anything, just looked at [Xu Zhuo] in front of her. After a while, she turned her head without continuing to look at [Xu Zhuo], her eyes staring blankly at the ground, [Xu Zhuo] couldn't help but rub his hands.
1:5:55|1:6:1|[Ye Xun] then looked up at him again, as [Xu Zhuo] began to recount the car accident he experienced three years ago.
1:6:1|1:6:20|After the bus he was riding in was hit, his head struck the seat in front of him. With the remaining consciousness, he trembled and unsteadily got up from his seat, blood on his clothes. He grabbed the handrail of the bus and climbed out through the shattered window in front.
1:7:21|1:7:26|He was hoping for a response from [Ye Xun], but her eyes became evasive.
1:7:27|1:7:32|[Ye Xun] said these words without looking into [Xu Zhuo]'s eyes. After a while, he raised his eyes and looked at [Xu Zhuo].
1:7:34|1:7:46|[Ye Xun] got up from the chair and walked away, leaving [Xu Zhuo] sitting in the distance, lost in thought as he watched her back. [Huang Da] carried a large box and rang the doorbell at [Ye Xun]'s house, then peered inside through a hole in the wall next to the house.
1:7:46|1:7:51|At this moment, [Ye Xun] and [Xu Zhuo] returned home and saw [Huang Da] peering inside at the door.
1:7:51|1:8:9|[Ye Xun] also leaned against the wall and looked inside the hole. Turning his head, he said, "[Xu Zhuo] walked to the door, took out the room key card and swiped it on the door lock, then opened the door. After looking at it, [Huang Da] said to [Ye Xun], "[Xu Zhuo] walked around to [Ye Xun]'s side."
1:8:40|1:8:48|[Xu Zhuo] finished speaking and turned to walk into the house, [Huang Da] found it hard to refuse. The three of them went to a high-end restaurant together.
1:9:9|1:9:16|[Huang Da]'s words made [Ye Xun] laugh, and [Ye Xun] covered her mouth with her hand and laughed out loud.
1:9:22|1:9:27|[Xu Zhuo] picked up the small bowl in front of [Ye Xun] and poured its contents into the dish.
1:9:29|1:9:37|[Huang Da] saw this scene and hesitated for a moment with the water cup in his hand, [Ye Xun] looked up at [Huang Da].
1:10:22|1:10:43|[Huang Da] put down the water cup in his hand upon hearing this, while [Ye Xun] stopped eating, biting her lower lip as she watched the scene in front of her. She lowered her head, unable to resist looking up at [Huang Da].
1:11:14|1:11:23|[Xu Zhuo] held [Ye Xun]'s hand and spoke, [Huang Da] bent down to pick up the coins that fell out of the wallet on the ground, then stood up and said to them:
1:11:49|1:12:5|[Ye Xun] stopped talking and [Huang Da] returned to his workplace after leaving the restaurant. He and his coworkers were cutting and installing renovation equipment. Suddenly, a car drove in, and [Huang Da] immediately dropped what he was holding and ran towards the house. [Ye Xun] got out of the car and saw [Huang Da] running inside.
1:12:5|1:12:18|After closing the car door, she walked straight into the house.
1:12:55|1:13:6|After saying what she wanted to say, [Ye Xun] left, then turned back unwillingly to look inside the room. [Huang Da] hid behind the wall and heard everything [Ye Xun] said. He only came out from behind the wall after [Ye Xun] left.
1:13:12|1:13:23|Xiong pushed the stone and Hu Zi away, and the two picked up their tools to continue working. Xiong turned back to Huang Da and Huang Da put away the tape measure in his hand.
1:13:25|1:13:32|[Huang Da] was at a loss for words when he heard Xiong Ge's words, and Xiong Ge reminded him before leaving.
1:13:34|1:13:41|[Huang Da] casually agreed with a sentence, then turned and walked to the side to continue working, while [Xu Zhuo] arrived at a 4S store.
1:13:50|1:14:1|[Huang Da] came to the store and found [Xu Zhuo]. He saw [Xu Zhuo] sitting on the sofa inside, gesturing with his hand for him to go outside. [Xu Zhuo] got up and followed him.
1:14:52|1:15:3|After saying that, [Xu Zhuo] turned and left to get his car inside the shop, while [Huang Da] went back to work. He asked his colleagues to leave first and then walked to the side.
1:15:16|1:15:38|He dialed a phone number on his cell phone, and upon hearing a voice, he looked up to see several workers in the distance slowly raising a huge banner with [Ye Xun]'s photo on it. [Huang Da] stood in place, looking up at the photo of [Ye Xun]. [Ye Xun]'s concert was about to begin, and she held two tickets in the dressing room, asking the staff to do her a favor by separating the two seats.
1:15:42|1:15:55|[Taozi] grabbed the ticket and walked to the side, holding a pen to write on the back of the ticket. [Ye Xun] quickly got up and walked towards [Taozi] after seeing her actions.
1:16:13|1:16:20|[Huang Da] arrived at the front desk of the concert hall, picked up the ticket left by [Ye Xun], and found [Xu Zhuo] already seated at his place in the audience.
1:16:21|1:16:37|[Huang Da] walked to the venue after getting the ticket and started looking for the seat number on the ticket. After confirming several rows, he walked through the narrow aisle. When he was about to reach his seat, he saw [Xu Zhuo]. [Xu Zhuo] paused for a moment, then stood up to let him pass.
1:16:37|1:16:55|[Huang Da] walked over and sat beside him, the two of them awkwardly and cautiously glanced at each other, a beam of light shining on the stage. Illuminating the piano and a chair on the stage. After seeing the chair on the stage, [Huang Da] smiled and then looked down at the ticket in his hand, flipping it over.
1:17:2|1:17:26|[Xu Zhuo] turned his head and saw the words on the ticket held by [Huang Da]. At that moment, a door on the side of the stage opened, and applause erupted from the audience below. [Ye Xun] and the pianist, dressed in formal attire, walked to the center of the stage and bowed to the audience. [Huang Da] saw [Ye Xun] getting excited and clapping below as she took the stage. [Ye Xun] sat on the chair, the applause from the audience below ceased, and she entered into the performance mode.
1:17:26|1:17:38|The sound of the piano came first, and [Ye Xun] slowly pulled the cello in her hands. She closed her eyes and devoted herself wholeheartedly, her fingers skillfully sliding on the strings, while the audience below listened carefully.
1:17:38|1:18:2|As the music gradually plays on, [Ye Xun] seems to understand what [Taozi] is saying. She feels like she already has the answer in her heart, with the image of a person constantly in her mind - that person is [Huang Da]. Holding the qin in her hands, she looks towards [Huang Da] in the audience. [Huang Da] smiles at her and continues to attentively enjoy her performance. [Ye Xun] is lost in memories, thinking back to the dinner party that ended on a sour note that day.
1:18:2|1:18:26|After returning home, she carefully unpacked the boxes brought by [Huang Da], and found a wooden chair inside. She gently touched the back of the chair with her hand, slowly sliding down to the legs of the chair with a smile in her eyes, showing her joy and appreciation. On the chair was a postcard from [Huang Da], and she picked it up and gently flipped open the first page.
1:19:20|1:19:25|[Xu Zhuo] picked up his ticket, [Huang Da] was stunned, there was also a sentence written on his ticket,
1:19:53|1:20:14|[Xu Zhuo] sat on the chair, leaning slightly forward, and bowed to him. On stage, [Ye Xun] recalled everything [Huang Da] had done for her, tears streaming down her face. After the music ended, she slowly raised her head and looked downstage.
1:20:14|1:20:31|The audience below the stage applauded one after another, and the hall was once again covered with applause, but only [Huang Da] did not clap. By now, his eyes had gradually blurred, the entire eye sockets covered with tears, his eyes were red. He held back for a while, but tears eventually welled up and overflowed.
1:20:31|1:20:55|But thinking about what [Xu Zhuo] said would make [Ye Xun] happy, he smiled again. After [Ye Xun] left the backstage and ran towards the agreed meeting point with [Huang Da], [Huang Da] turned around and applauded when he heard footsteps. The performance just now was fantastic. [Ye Xun] reached out and tightly held [Huang Da]'s hand. [Huang Da] hesitated for a moment, but eventually withdrew his hand.
1:21:23|1:21:39|[Huang Da] smiled and finished speaking to [Xu Zhuo], then walked past [Ye Xun]. Tears kept flowing down [Ye Xun]'s face. After [Huang Da] turned and left, he felt extremely sad in his heart. He tried hard to suppress his emotions, not wanting his tears to fall. He forced back the tears and walked forward.
1:21:45|1:21:53|[Ye Xun] remained motionless in the position [Huang Da] left her in, until [Xu Zhuo] took out a ring and grabbed her left hand.
1:21:54|1:22:8|[Ye Xun] glanced down at the ring in [Xu Zhuo]'s hand. Seeing that she didn't refuse, [Xu Zhuo] put the ring on her ring finger. Tears welled up in [Ye Xun]'s eyes as she forced a smile. The current situation was completely unexpected for her, and she didn't know what to do.
1:22:9|1:22:17|Seeing [Ye Xun] like this, [Xu Zhuo] embraced him tightly, and [Ye Xun] leaned against his chest, unable to stop sobbing.
1:22:17|1:22:37|The next day, [Xu Zhuo] brought [Ye Xun] to a wedding venue. In the hall, many couples were choosing wedding dresses. At the next table, people were happily selecting dress styles, but [Ye Xun] sat coldly and calmly in her seat, showing no interest at all. Meanwhile, [Huang Da] started another blind date as Xiong Ge introduced him to a girl.
1:22:37|1:23:0|However, at the dining table, [Huang Da] appeared somewhat indifferent. He was unwilling to get to know his blind date, just nodding along without much interest. Xiongge tried to liven up the atmosphere, while [Ye Xun] at the wedding venue looked up at the ceiling. When it came to ordering food, the dating [Huang Da] stood up and left the table, leaving the girl looking puzzled at Xiongge. Xiongge tried to call back [Huang Da], but he left without even looking back.
1:23:0|1:23:13|[Ye Xun] tried on one wedding dress after another at the wedding venue, while [Huang Da] stood blankly outside the mall. Xiong Ge sent away the blind date that was introduced to [Huang Da], put his hands on his hips and took a deep breath, then walked to [Huang Da] and said to him:
1:23:28|1:23:36|Brother Xiong put away the matchmaking handbook in his hand and looked at [Huang Da].
1:23:45|1:24:8|Huang Da walked away angrily, then quickly turned back. He stuffed a letter into [Huang Da]'s hand and handed over the item before leaving again. After coming to his senses, [Huang Da] quickly opened the envelope, took out the letter from inside, and read it carefully. It was written by [Ye Xun].
1:24:52|1:24:59|[Huang Da] was walking on the street when he heard [Ye Xun]'s voice coming from a taxi. He immediately leaned against the taxi window to watch the news being played inside.
1:25:0|1:25:15|[Ye Xun] and [Xu Zhuo] are being interviewed by reporters. While [Xu Zhuo] is responding to the questions, [Ye Xun] can't help but bite her lower lip, a scene noticed by [Huang Da]. In the blink of an eye, it's [Ye Xun]'s wedding day, she stands in her wedding gown, staring blankly in the church corridor.
1:25:16|1:25:28|[Huang Da] was sitting alone in a dimly lit room. From outside the room, there were occasional bursts of applause and some people shouting. Huang Da nervously swallowed, then stood up.
1:25:31|1:25:36|[Ye Xun] leaned against the wall and casually nodded.
1:28:15|1:28:34|The two hosts left the stage. The spotlight focused on [Huang Da], holding a microphone in his hand, he looked up and sang the love declaration by Qi Qin to the audience below.
1:28:59|1:29:16|He turned off the TV with the remote control after seeing it, then walked to the side. [Ye Xun] followed with the hem of her wedding dress in hand. As she was about to catch up, she slowed down. [Xu Zhuo] noticed that she gradually stopped behind him, and [Ye Xun] grabbed [Xu Zhuo]'s arm from behind.
1:29:30|1:29:35|[Xu Zhuo] frowned and turned to look at [Ye Xun] upon hearing her words.
1:29:42|1:29:46|[Ye Xun] pulled [Xu Zhuo]'s hand and sat on the nearby bench.
1:30:20|1:30:32|[Ye Xun] recalls everything [Huang Da] has done for her, spending all his money on buying lottery tickets, confessing his love to her on the street. He lost the ring he bought for 20,000 yuan, and the two searched for it together on the beach, eventually finding a screw nut.
1:30:32|1:30:41|While practicing the cello, [Huang Da] was quietly by her side. In order to make a chair for her, he tried his best to measure the dimensions. Holding back tears, [Xu Zhuo] said to her:
1:30:50|1:30:57|73 years ago, [Xu Zhuo] recounted the car accident from three years ago to [Ye Xun], who looked at the familiar yet unfamiliar [Xu Zhuo] in front of her.
1:31:21|1:31:28|Xu Zhuo, who climbed out of the car, ran forward regardless of everything.
1:31:40|1:32:4|[Ye Xun] gently squeezed out a smile, then reached out and hugged [Xu Zhuo]. [Xu Zhuo] patted her back with one hand, responding to her hug. After [Ye Xun] let go of [Xu Zhuo] and stood up, she smiled at him and then left with the train of her wedding dress. [Xu Zhuo]'s eyes filled with tears, he lowered his head in disappointment as [Ye Xun] passed by the wedding scene.
1:32:20|1:32:24|[Huang Da] has just finished singing on stage, and the audience below burst into applause.
1:32:45|1:32:52|The numbers on the big screen started spinning, [Huang Da] and the host turned to look at the screen. After spinning for a while, the numbers finally stopped.
1:33:7|1:33:24|[Ye Xun] shouted a sentence from the high platform towards the audience below. The host and audience on the scene, including [Huang Da], all looked up in surprise at [Ye Xun]. Then [Huang Da] handed the microphone to the host and rushed towards [Ye Xun]. He stumbled and almost tripped on the steps, but after getting up, he looked at [Ye Xun].
1:33:26|1:33:33|[Huang Da] holds back tears.
1:33:33|1:33:58|[Ye Xun] nodded quickly with tears in her eyes, then bent down into the arms of [Huang Da]. [Huang Da] hugged [Ye Xun] tightly, and the audience around them burst into applause, with the host also clapping and congratulating them. [Huang Da] was about to let go of [Ye Xun] and run off the stage, but [Ye Xun] held onto him, reaching into her own chest and pulling out the bolt she kissed with tears in her eyes, then handed it to [Huang Da].
1:33:58|1:34:13|[Ye Xun] reached out her right hand to [Huang Da], who gently placed the ring on her ring finger. Then he pulled [Ye Xun] into his arms, holding her tightly. Everyone in the audience witnessed this proposal of love, applauding for their love.
1:34:13|1:34:20|Many female viewers cast envious glances as their romantic proposal was broadcast live on the show.
