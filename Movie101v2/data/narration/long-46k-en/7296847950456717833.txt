0:1:42|0:1:49|Several men tied big paper flowers to the dung bucket, and the surrounding crowd looked happy. There were also reporters on site filming the scene.
0:2:31|0:2:34|We will never see the worker carrying a bucket of manure on his back again.
0:2:57|0:3:3|So, [Shi Chuanxiang], a third-generation night soil man, had to carry the feces out bucket by bucket from here.
0:3:32|0:3:50|Students rushed forward and gathered around the dung barrel, playing and laughing. [Shi Chuanxiang] and the janitors carried the dung barrel towards the new cleaning vehicle. Their faces were filled with happy smiles. [Shi Chuanxiang] put down the dung barrel and smiled as she looked at the children around her. She walked through the crowd and noticed the Liberation Teacher in the distance.
0:3:50|0:3:56|A person stood under the sun, staring blankly into the distance. [Shi Chuanxiang] walked up to him and asked.
0:4:1|0:4:21|She looked at the run-down toilet in front of her and said to [Shi Chuanxiang]. She couldn't help but fall into memories. On a cold winter day, she, still a child, was abandoned at the door of this toilet in the wall fort, crying loudly on the cold stone bench. As the memory returned to reality, she looked at the half-ruined toilet in front of her, tears streaming down her face.
0:4:31|0:4:39|A SUV is driving along, with the greenery on the sides of the road neatly trimmed. At this moment, Lawyer Fang receives a phone call.
0:7:5|0:7:18|The old lady was lost in memories. When she was young, she worked at the Liu family's house. On this day, she was washing clothes in the courtyard, lifting them out of the basin, wringing them dry, shaking them up and down, and hanging them on the rope. At that moment, a man's voice could be heard from outside the door.
0:7:35|0:7:41|Yingzi nodded, turned to start tidying up, she gathered the clothes on the rope and said to [Shi Chuanxiang] at the door.
0:7:44|0:7:55|[Shi Chuanxiang] was wearing patched clothes and carrying a heavy bucket of manure as he walked quickly towards the courtyard. Yingzi, seeing his loyalty, went into the house, filled a bowl with water, and brought it out, calling out to [Shi Chuanxiang].
0:8:7|0:8:15|Mrs. Liu snatched the bowl from Ying Zui's hand and poured the water into the cat's bowl on the ground, leaving Ying Zui in disbelief. At that moment, [Shi Chuanxiang] walked over.
0:8:24|0:8:41|Mrs. Liu pointed at the cat bowl and said to [Shi Chuanxiang]. [Shi Chuanxiang] looked at the fish bones floating in the bowl, feeling furious with eyes full of anger. Without saying a word, he angrily walked towards the door. Stepping over the threshold, he looked back in anger, suppressing his rage and walked away.
0:8:41|0:8:50|Upon seeing this situation, Yingzi also felt heartbroken. [Shi Chuanxiang] swiftly lifted the manure into a large bucket, took another look at the Liu family's courtyard, and then stormed off in anger.
0:10:6|0:10:13|Old Wang happily came to collect the steamed buns with a basket, but unexpectedly the other party only gave him four, let's go.
0:11:26|0:11:32|Night falls, Shi Chuanxiang and Cui Xiuting are dining at the fishing village, the restaurant is bustling with many customers.
0:11:42|0:11:55|The delicious beer, tasty snacks, and fresh fish made the customers lick their fingers uncontrollably. Lawyer Fang leisurely sipped on his juice, while Lingling enjoyed her food with great pleasure. Watching Lingling's hearty eating, Lawyer Fang set down his juice and couldn't help but say to her.
0:12:52|0:12:56|The next day, the two of them arrived at the nursing home and took good care of [Mrs. Shen].
0:14:22|0:14:36|[Lingling] saw the situation and immediately signaled to [Lawyer Fang]. [Lawyer Fang] understood instantly and quickly turned on the radio. That winter, the People's Liberation Army surrounded Beijing and cold guns were fired everywhere.
0:15:45|0:15:59|[Cui Xiuting] stood at the door, holding the child, looking a bit lost. She glanced around privately for a while, then walked into the alley with the child in her arms. She covered her face with a scarf, held the child close, passed through layers of smoke, and walked past the temple.
0:15:59|0:16:4|She cautiously observed the surroundings at the intersection, made sure there was no one on the road, and then continued walking outward.
0:16:5|0:16:20|Walking through the winding alleys, Shi Chuanxiang arrived at a dilapidated outhouse. After cautiously looking around to make sure no one had noticed, he carefully placed the child on a large stone at the entrance of the outhouse, neatly wrapped and standing out from the dirty and messy surroundings.
0:16:21|0:16:39|He slowly stood up and looked at the child, preparing to leave as he stepped back. Unexpectedly, as soon as he turned around, the child started crying. He hurriedly ran back to the child, crouched down, gently patting the back to comfort. However, no matter how he tried to soothe the child, the child kept crying incessantly.
0:16:39|0:16:55|At this moment, a sound of footsteps approached, [Shi Chuanxiang] looked up alertly, quickly hiding behind the latrine. [Cui Xiuting] pushed the manure cart forward, stopping it at the latrine door, lifting the bucket to start working. As he turned his head, he saw the eagle on the stone.
0:16:56|0:17:11|He quickly put down the bucket, carefully picked up the child, completely unaware that the eagle was peeking from behind the wall. The child in Shi Chuanxiang's arms kept crying, as he gently comforted the child and looked around trying to find the child's family.
0:17:12|0:17:30|Unable to gain anything in the end, Yingzi quickly hid in the women's restroom. [Shi Chuanxiang] looked at the pitiful child in his arms, the surroundings empty and deserted, with no one in sight, so he left with the child. Yingzi watched [Shi Chuanxiang] walk away and secretly memorized his appearance.
0:17:30|0:17:32|Mrs. Shen recalled the past, tasting that breath of hers.
0:17:40|0:17:44|Lawyer Fang turned off the radio, and only then did Lingling react. She continued to ask.
0:17:45|0:17:54|Mrs. Shen looked at her with a serious expression and shook her head. Lingling looked disappointedly at Lawyer Fang behind her, and after a moment of contemplation, Lawyer Fang leaned forward and asked.
0:18:10|0:18:13|[Shi Chuanxiang] wanted to carry the child and walk home.
0:18:28|0:18:43|Shi Chuanxiang's wife is at home cooking over a fire, while their son is playing on the heated brick bed. A pot of millet porridge is boiling on the stove. Just as his wife finishes stirring the porridge, Shi Chuanxiang enters carrying their child.
0:19:5|0:19:8|The wife unbuttons her cotton-padded jacket and wraps the child in her arms.
0:19:13|0:19:31|[Shi Chuanxiang] took out a small bowl, scooped a bowl of millet porridge from the pot, and placed it in front of his wife. The child in his arms was hungry and kept whimpering. His wife dipped her finger into the porridge, blew on it carefully, and fed it to the child. Seeing the child enjoying the meal, the wife looked up and happily said to [Shi Chuanxiang].
0:20:32|0:20:48|Two months later, Beiping was liberated. Outside, there was a lot of noise, firecrackers were going off, and the streets were lined with banners. People were dancing in the streets, celebrating the good news. [Shi Chuanxiang] walked on the street holding a child, looking at the lively scene, feeling extremely happy.
0:20:48|0:20:52|In the street, the wealthy villagers are all smiles, waving the chess pieces in their hands.
0:20:53|0:21:6|The young man dressed in bright clothing, dancing in a neat manner, with Chairman Mao's portrait on the street uplifting everyone's spirits. [Shi Chuanxiang] is overjoyed, holding a child with a happy smile on his face.
0:21:6|0:21:19|Before long, he walked through the bustling crowd to the military hall, where a group of innocent and lively children approached him under the guidance of a female comrade, followed by two male comrades. Upon seeing this, [Shi Chuanxiang] quickly turned to one of the male comrades and asked.
0:21:36|0:21:59|[Shi Chuanxiang] looked into the room with the child in his arms, pushed the door open and walked in, closing the door behind him. Inside, a female comrade was taking care of a child. She smiled and walked up to him, saying, "This lady..." Looking at the hand extended by the female comrade, [Shi Chuanxiang] hesitated for a moment before gently shaking hands with her.
0:23:57|0:23:59|Most of the students have unleashed their imagination.
0:24:0|0:24:15|Some students wrote about moving their homes to mid-air, while others wrote about moving their homes to the forest. One student had a more interesting idea, saying they wanted to move their home to Mars. The students all laughed.
0:25:52|0:25:59|Later on, Mr. Chen, who went to the United States, came into some money and wanted to find an heir.
0:26:4|0:26:10|However, that little girl's birthday is around the same time as when you went to the welfare home.
0:26:14|0:26:18|[Shi Chuanxiang] took the photo and looked at it, then said to the lawyer.
0:27:1|0:27:14|Just two years ago, he passed away. [Shi Chuanxiang] sighed, adjusted his emotions, and then started the class.
0:28:22|0:28:38|[Shi Chuanxiang] opens the bookcase in his home and takes out an old album from the bottom shelf. He slowly closes the cabinet door, sits on the comfortable sofa in the living room, and starts flipping through it. The album is filled with photos from his childhood, bringing back memories of his youth.
0:28:39|0:28:58|In the photo, she looks lively and lovely, with shoulder-length short hair, a neat shirt, and a serious and delicate look while reading. At this moment, a blue solo photo caught her attention. She picked up the album and looked closely, smiling as she recalled the happy days at the welfare home.
0:30:39|0:30:56|Auntie dragged Sister into the courtyard, followed closely by [Shi Chuanxiang] and his disciple Xiao Wang. At that moment, the girl with twin ponytails, Guiying, was lingering at the courtyard gate. Xiao Wang, carrying a bucket of manure on his back, came out of the courtyard first and immediately saw Guiying. He quickly lowered his head and hid inside the courtyard.
0:30:56|0:31:4|[Shi Chuanxiang] happened to walk out of the courtyard and felt a bit strange seeing Xiao Wang's self-deprecating look. When he saw Guiying, he had the answer in his heart.
0:32:20|0:32:27|[Shi Chuanxiang] took off his work clothes and saw Xiao Wang washing his hands on the side, looking gloomy. He bent down, smiled at him, and teased him.
0:34:4|0:34:10|The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant produced Liberation brand trucks, and they will also produce various types of professional vehicles for different industries in the future.
0:34:44|0:34:47|After work, [Shi Chuanxiang] rides his bicycle home with Liberation.
0:34:57|0:35:7|Shi Chuanxiang and Cui Xiuting happily walked towards their home. Inside, the wife was adding dumplings into the steaming pot and stirring with a spoon before turning to everyone and saying.
0:35:54|0:36:0|[Shi Chuanxiang] puts on a raincoat and says to Xiao Liu.
0:36:42|0:36:56|Torrential rain poured down incessantly, the rain hitting [Shi Chuanxiang]'s face, making it hard to keep his eyes open. He was dressed in a raincoat and carrying a bucket and tools as he walked into the heavily flooded alley, followed by Xiao Wang and his colleagues.
0:37:19|0:37:30|The sky was filled with lightning, pouring rain, and even the small path was flooded. [Shi Chuanxiang] wanted to walk into the courtyard in the heavy rain, while Xiao Wang behind him looked disgusted.
0:38:9|0:38:28|The old lady's outhouse was on the verge of collapsing due to heavy rain, and [Shi Chuanxiang] decided to help her quickly rebuild it. Although Xiao Wang was reluctant, he also started to help. However, he accidentally picked up a brick covered in filth, which made him vomit violently.
0:38:28|0:38:31|[Shi Chuanxiang] laughed when he saw him in such a sorry state.
0:39:45|0:39:54|The old lady chased after him with an umbrella and a bucket of water, but she couldn't catch up. She stood at the entrance of the alley, watching [Shi Chuanxiang] walk away, feeling grateful in her heart.
0:40:56|0:41:1|In the evening, the son took down the chest flower hanging on the wall by Shi Chuanxiang and looked at it carefully.
0:41:56|0:42:1|They went together to the Great Hall of the People to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country with the party and state leaders.
0:43:4|0:43:18|In the glorious history of our motherland, countless heroes have emerged. The magnificent rivers and mountains of our motherland bear the sacred traces of countless heroes. But the greatest hero is born today.
0:43:18|0:43:31|To achieve greater victory, on October 26th, more than 6,000 heroes gathered at the Great Hall of the People in the capital, holding high the red flag of the general line and showcasing the achievements of the Great Leap Forward.
0:43:44|0:43:52|[Shi Chuanxiang] returned to the alley after attending the gathering of outstanding individuals. His coworkers welcomed him warmly with drums and gongs, and even displayed a photo of him with Chairman Liu Shaoqi.
0:44:17|0:44:25|The workers were excited and pulled [Shi Chuanxiang] onto the stage, asking him to give a speech. He stood on the stage and spoke to everyone with a big smile on his face.
0:46:34|0:46:44|Everyone was delighted after listening, and they all crowded forward to shake hands with [Shi Chuanxiang]. That night, when they returned home, his wife looked at the photo of [Shi Chuanxiang] and Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and couldn't stop smiling.
0:48:0|0:48:15|Yes, Chairman Liu said that an advanced worker, a Communist Party member, not only needs to excel in work, but also in all aspects. The children took the pens and looked at them carefully.
0:48:53|0:49:13|In the end, it was Jin Fang who got the pen. At night, after work, he gently closed the pen cap and looked at the pen in his hand with a satisfied smile. He turned to look at the calligraphy on the wall, which read "Educating and Teaching". This plunged him into memories, causing Shi Chuanxiang to enter the room.
0:50:3|0:50:9|Under everyone's gaze, Jiefang was writing diligently according to the instructions of [Shi Chuanxiang].
0:50:26|0:50:44|All the comrades were deeply moved and unanimously expressed their firm determination to listen to the Party and to you, to continue to work hard, do their jobs better, and actively study and write.
0:50:51|0:51:2|To become a cultured worker and contribute more to socialist construction.
0:51:3|0:51:20|In 2001, Beijing already had a specialized garbage processing plant, with various garbage trucks neatly lined up inside the plant. Lawyer Fang drove a car through the spacious square and entered the plant, where [Shi Chuanxiang]'s daughter, Cui Xiuting, was working.
0:53:18|0:53:34|A bouquet of flowers was placed in front of the statue of [Shi Chuanxiang], his diligent and simple image is admirable. Fang, the lawyer, and Lingling were focused on the statue, completely unaware of the Liberation Teacher behind them. The Liberation Teacher looked at the backs of the two, filled with confusion.
0:53:34|0:53:38|After a moment, Lawyer Fang and Lingling were ready to leave, and Shi Chuanxiang took the initiative to approach.
0:54:37|0:54:47|When I remember coming back from work sometimes, Shi Chuanxiang and Cui Xiuting would smile knowingly, but their liberated expressions would turn serious.
0:55:9|0:55:30|Both of them fell into silence after listening. Memories went back to the Cultural Revolution, when the streets were filled with big-character posters, creating a tense atmosphere. [Shi Chuanxiang] was deeply worried, and he decided to go home to visit [Cui Xiuting].
0:55:30|0:55:38|At night, [Shi Chuanxiang] walked towards home alone, his heart pounding, tightly gripping his pants, always paying attention to the surroundings.
0:56:17|0:56:25|[Shi Chuanxiang] picked up the broken photo frame from the pile of debris on the ground. He looked at the photo in his hand, pondered for a moment, and suddenly felt something was wrong.
0:59:7|0:59:19|[Shi Chuanxiang] listened and then smiled with satisfaction. He trembled as he took out the pen Chairman Liu Shaoqi had given him from under the pillow. He held it carefully in his hand, examining it closely, and let out a soft sigh.
0:59:53|0:59:57|[Shi Chuanxiang] eyes filled with tears, took the pen from [Cui Xiuting]'s hand with both hands.
1:0:23|1:0:26|Shi Chuanxiang sat gasping for breath on the chair and spoke to everyone.
1:1:48|1:2:2|Especially, outside the city gate, the residents of the small houses in the alleys have strong opinions.
1:3:35|1:3:53|The next morning, the wife, supporting Shi Chuanxiang, walked down the stairs with a cane. Neighbors around came out of their homes to watch. As they walked out of the alley, they saw Xiao Wang and the children just around the corner. The two sons were wearing dung-cleaning work clothes, holding tools, and walking towards him together.
1:4:7|1:4:23|Shi Chuanxiang patted Xiao Wang on the shoulder, then looked at his two sons in work clothes, finally feeling relieved. He adjusted his military coat, and with the help of Xiao Wang and his wife, walked towards the tricycle loaded with luggage.
1:4:23|1:4:29|With the help of everyone, he sat in the back seat of the tricycle, while his wife attentively helped him tidy up his clothes.
1:5:44|1:5:56|Shi Chuanxiang nodded in agreement after listening. The couple got on a tricycle and bid farewell to everyone reluctantly.
1:5:58|1:6:14|With the master's command, [Shi Chuanxiang] and [Cui Xiuting] bid farewell to everyone with a heavy heart. The children, watching the couple leave, felt not only reluctant to part but also lost. As the two walked away, Xiao Wang led the other three to get ready for work.
1:6:25|1:6:32|[Shi Chuanxiang] answered Lingling's question with a smile, then recalled the days of helping Ishikawa Xiang pick manure.
1:8:28|1:8:42|Everyone took out drinks and tea from their homes for them to drink, and the unspoken gratitude was also gathered in the water. After [Shi Chuanxiang] and his wife left Beijing, they changed to a bus to head towards their hometown.
1:9:30|1:9:46|When [Shi Chuanxiang] was young, he and his friends set out on the road to Beiping. They traveled during the day, rested at night, and drank water from the river when they were thirsty. At night, they sat around the campfire, eating dry rations together. Shi Chuanxiang opened his bundle, only to find the last steamed bun inside.
1:9:46|1:9:55|Watching his friends enjoying their meal, [Shi Chuanxiang] stood up and moved to a distant spot alone. Unexpectedly, as soon as he sat down, he heard the sound of a boy crying.
1:10:9|1:10:16|By the bonfire, the boy noticed something unusual about Shi Chuanxiang. He stood up and walked over to Shi Chuanxiang, saying.
1:11:23|1:11:35|Shi Chuanxiang embarked on the road to Beiping alone as his friends refused to continue. Walking on the railway track, with cracked lips and weary steps, he displayed signs of exhaustion.
1:11:37|1:11:50|But his eyes were full of anticipation for Beiping. Shi Chuanxiang arrived in Beiping on a snowy day, and he fainted at the entrance of a hutong on his way from the airport. He happened to be seen by a scavenger who was working early.
1:11:50|1:11:59|Lao Wang carefully turned over his curled body, felt his breath with his hand, helped him up, and peeled off the accumulated blood from his body.
1:13:2|1:13:10|In the room, the master and two aunts are happily dining. Shi Chuanxiang is lying by the window, observing the situation inside.
1:15:29|1:15:44|Shi Chuanxiang's request for leave was not approved. In the evening, he and Lao Wang prepared the grass for feeding the donkeys together. Lao Wang put the grass into the trough, everything was arranged properly. Looking at the gloomy Shi Chuanxiang, he already had the answer in his heart.
1:15:44|1:15:54|He sat down on the kang slowly, while Shi Chuanxiang beside him was dejected and silent. Lao Wang, on the other hand, remained calm and handed his own cigarette to Shi Chuanxiang.
1:16:1|1:16:6|Lao Wang's words undoubtedly hit Shi [Chuanxiang] hard.
1:16:40|1:16:50|At this moment, Shi Chuanxiang still had no idea. His bride had already been brought into the house by his mother. Cui Xiuting took off the headpiece and placed it in a box, holding the lid and looking around the so-called new room.
1:16:50|1:17:0|The rooster on the ground is desperately exerting itself. It looks somewhat bewildered at the simple new house, and can only sit on the kang. Just as it sits down, the voice of the mother is heard.
1:17:9|1:17:29|He quickly blew out the kerosene lamp on the table. The next morning, [Cui Xiuting] was awakened by the crowing of a rooster. He quickly pulled back the blanket and sat up, looking at the empty room with a sense of loss. Then he picked up the quilt cover used for the wedding on the kang yesterday, looked back and forth, feeling uneasy.
1:17:56|1:18:7|[Cui Xiuting] immediately realized and started to take off the coat on her body. Underneath the coat, she was wearing a patched cotton padded jacket. Seeing her sister-in-law looking at her, she smiled and said.
1:18:28|1:18:35|Watching the neighbor auntie take away the rooster, [Cui Xiuting] couldn't hold back anymore and started crying sadly.
1:19:32|1:19:38|Following that, [Shi Chuanxiang] recounted the story from that year.
1:19:56|1:20:9|Shi Chuanxiang, who had finally finished work, picked up his package and hurried home. Walking alone, he set foot on the familiar road back home. When Shi Chuanxiang arrived home, Cui Xiuting was cooking in the yard.
1:20:57|1:21:11|[Cui Xiuting] happily returned to the room, blushing as she closed the door, opened the dressing box, took out a mirror, carefully tidied her hair and clothes, preparing to meet [Shi Chuanxiang]. Just then, voices could be heard outside the door.
1:21:29|1:21:46|[Cui Xiuting] heard a sound and immediately covered her head with a quilt. [Shi Chuanxiang] pushed open the door and saw [Cui Xiuting] sitting on the heated brick bed. She walked towards [Cui Xiuting] with a smile on her face. She happened to see the unfinished mandarin ducks embroidered on [Cui Xiuting]'s quilt, and she praised with a smile.
1:21:55|1:22:4|[Shi Chuanxiang] gently lifts the blanket, looks down at the shy [Cui Xiuting], and can't help but praise her with a smile.
1:22:8|1:22:20|[Cui Xiuting] blushed and quickly put down the veil. [Shi Chuanxiang] looked at the beautiful and elegant bride, hugged [Cui Xiuting] tightly, with a happy smile on his face.
1:22:25|1:22:52|As long as we keep moving forward, there is no impassable Flame Mountain road. The road will definitely get wider as we go, not afraid of the difficult path, let's walk together without separating. The couple tightly held each other's hands, affectionately leaning against each other, sitting in a carriage heading towards the Ma family in Shandong.
1:22:52|1:23:7|Finally, in August 1973, after Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai learned of the matter, they instructed the relevant departments to bring him back to Beijing, politically rehabilitate him, and restore his reputation. Comrade Shi Chuanxiang passed away on May 19, 1975, at the age of 60.
1:23:9|1:23:35|The noble spirit of sacrificing oneself for the greater good, as demonstrated by [Shi Chuanxiang], is worth learning from. Fast forward to the present, Lawyer Fang is driving with Old Lady Shen on the road. Unable to contain her curiosity, Old Lady Shen couldn't help but ask. Lawyer Fang's response surprises Old Lady Shen, who can't help but look out the window at the bustling city.
1:23:36|1:23:47|Looking at the tall buildings outside the window, Mrs. Shen hesitated to speak.
1:25:23|1:25:33|Lawyer Fang took out a camera, ready to take a photo for Mrs. Shen. [Lingling] happened to notice him. [Jiefang] was holding a bouquet of flowers and walking towards Lawyer Fang.
1:25:44|1:25:48|[Shi Chuanxiang] holds flowers and takes the initiative to greet Mrs. Shen.
1:26:21|1:26:41|[Shi Chuanxiang] placed the flowers by the fountain, looking at the place where he was abandoned as a child now transformed into towering skyscrapers, feeling a mix of emotions in his heart. The rapid development of the city has seen the shining five-star red flag fluttering in the wind, and [Cui Xiuting]'s spirit has never been extinguished in the continuous heritage of decades.
