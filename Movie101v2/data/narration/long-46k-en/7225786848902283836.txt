0:0:26|0:0:43|In a messy studio, the male protagonist [Da Cheng] of the movie is creating a painting. He looks at the sketchbook in his hand, then glances back at the paintings on the wall. Next, he moves to the easel behind him, where a beautiful woman in ancient costume, surrounded by large peonies, appears vividly on the paper.
0:0:43|0:1:4|However, the beauty was still missing the most important facial features to be drawn. [Da Cheng] used his brush to draw, feeling unsure of how to proceed. He sighed and turned around, but suddenly the painting emitted a golden light. As [Da Cheng] looked back at the changing painting, the beauty now had long flowing hair, captivating eyes and eyebrows, a slightly open mouth, and a graceful and light demeanor that swayed with the wind.
0:1:4|0:1:20|[Da Cheng] reached out eagerly, trying to grab the beauty, only to find her holding a peony in her hands. She spun around and disappeared into the painting. Disappointed, [Da Cheng] lightly clenched his hands and looked at them empty, then took a step back in frustration.
0:1:21|0:1:38|Suddenly, petals fluttered in the air again, and [Da Cheng] gazed wistfully in the direction they flew. At that moment, a peony slowly bloomed on the screen, with the movie title, "The Edict of the Peony Fairy Emperor," gradually appearing on the flower.
0:1:39|0:1:58|The scene shifts to a beautiful woman in Hanfu, dancing gracefully among peonies. She wears a long dress with a peony ornament between her eyebrows, looking playful and beautiful. With graceful posture and light dance moves, her sleeves sway with her movements, making her the most beautiful flower in the garden.
0:1:58|0:2:7|At this moment, [Da Cheng] walked through the flowers from a distance, but the beauty did not notice him. Finally, when she turned around, she noticed the painter, and the two were just a finger's length apart.
0:2:9|0:2:15|The painter lunged to grab the beauty, but she turned into petals and disappeared, leaving the painter shouting at the sky.
0:2:23|0:2:43|The hallucination fades, and the painter is back in the studio. It's as if he has just woken up from a dream, and he suddenly turns to look at the painting on the easel. He can't help but move closer to observe, but the painting remains unchanged. As he carefully imagines the face of the beautiful woman, suddenly, the TV next to him makes a sound. The painter leans in to take a closer look.
0:3:0|0:3:4|The focus of everyone is only on one thing.
0:3:11|0:3:27|In the year 690 AD, during the first year of the Tian Shou era, inside the Imperial Garden in Chang'an, in the deep of night, the cold moonlight illuminated the earth. Not far away, a beautiful woman was seen lighting the street lamps, her movements graceful and elegant. At the same time, a flustered middle-aged man rushed onto the path of Linyi.
0:3:37|0:3:46|Uncle Da Cheng smiled satisfactorily after receiving a response, but the next moment, an arrow flew in and pierced his body. Immediately after, a group of people ran up, but they did not see his figure.
0:3:50|0:4:13|As soon as the leader left, a man appeared and walked forward to inspect closely, staring intently in the direction of his subordinate's fingers. The masked swordsman retreated into the bushes. At this moment, the burly [Da Cheng] struggled to walk towards the beauty, a shiny gun fell in front of her, and he tremblingly took out an envelope from his pocket.
0:4:13|0:4:34|After speaking, [Da Cheng] fainted. He quickly picked up the letter in [Da Cheng]'s hand and saw someone approaching in the distance. He swiftly hid the letter, preparing to leave. The leader ran over angrily. He checked [Da Cheng]'s breathing, then glared fiercely at the beautiful woman next to him.
0:4:34|0:4:41|The man who was just seen walking over. He gave the beauty a cold stare.
0:4:46|0:4:54|[Da Cheng] was taken away by the guards, and then the lord turned his gaze towards the beauty. The cold eyes made the beauty shudder, and she instinctively moved away.
0:5:35|0:5:39|At this moment, the masked man picked up a stone and hit the window not far away.
0:5:46|0:5:54|The man forcibly embraced [Rui Yu], but was interrupted. The other flower girls all protected the bullied peony girl behind them.
0:6:4|0:6:6|[Wu San] failed to achieve his goal and left in anger.
0:6:15|0:6:26|The flower girl looked around at the pitch-black night, curious about who had saved her. Then she fell into deep thought, unsure of how to handle the unexpected letter. The next day, in the grand hall of the palace.
0:7:41|0:7:57|[Wu Zetian] had an angry expression on her face, causing the arguing ministers to lower their heads in fear. Then, she gave a signal to the little eunuch beside her to bring something prepared. One of the ministers who had just been arguing glanced at another person, then curiously watched as the thing was brought over.
0:7:57|0:8:7|The eunuch was holding a blank sacred paper, and [Empress Wu] signaled for him to completely unfold it. Then, he picked up the pen and hesitated before finally deciding to write.
0:8:8|0:8:25|The pearl chain on the crown swayed gently as the ministers who had just argued stole glances at each other, then looked up at [Empress Wu Zetian] who was writing the imperial edict. No one in the great hall dared to speak, all quietly waiting for [Empress Wu Zetian] to finish writing the edict, while only the palace maid fanning gently.
0:8:25|0:8:37|After a cup of tea, she finally finished writing and descended from the dragon boat. The palace maids came forward to support her, and the young eunuch carefully rolled up the decree she had written, then turned to the ministers in the court to read it aloud.
0:8:39|0:8:42|The minister who disagreed with the early blooming was very surprised.
0:8:59|0:9:15|The ministers knelt down on the ground, while in another quaint courtyard, Peony Flower Girl hurriedly ran from the yard to the front gate. She opened the gate, only to find two guards standing at the entrance. She quickly retreated and firmly held the door with a stick.
0:9:15|0:9:26|She paced back and forth in the courtyard, looking flustered and unsure of what to do, her face filled with anxiety. Suddenly, her expression changed, as if she had thought of something, and she pulled something out from her sleeve.
0:9:28|0:9:55|This is the letter that the uncle who died last night asked her to give to someone else. She hesitated for a moment, but decided to open the letter. The letter was wrapped in layers, obviously hiding important secrets. [Rui Yu] carefully read the contents of the letter, thinking of the uncle from last night. She tucked the letter into her sleeve.
0:10:3|0:10:10|After listening to the words of the Peony Pavilion lady, the other flower ladies also glanced outside the door, and everyone started to panic.
0:11:17|0:11:22|The five adults looked embarrassed, as one plan failed, another one was born, then they turned to look at their subordinates.
0:11:26|0:11:54|On the street, the flower girls are being escorted to Luoyang by the guards for defying the imperial decree, causing a stir among the people. The flower girls in the carriage have different expressions, listening to the sighs of the people outside. At the front of the procession, the leader of the guards on horseback looks stern.
0:12:52|0:13:7|Princess Rui Yu's skirt swayed as she walked, leaving a trail of fragrance behind her. Two palace maids followed her. She walked with dignity down the long staircase, with Minister Da Cheng quietly trailing behind her. She couldn't reach the camera and slowly sat down on the dragon throne.
0:14:7|0:14:20|The carriage escorting the flower girls has now arrived in a valley, where everything is quiet except for a few bird calls. The guards look around, while [Wu San], lurking on the hillside with his brothers, follows the carriage stealthily.
0:14:28|0:14:55|Suddenly, a flying knife with a note stabbed into the carriage, making the leader's guards extremely vigilant. He pulled out the knife, opened the note, and saw four big characters written on it: "Take a detour." Wu San, who was following behind, hurriedly caught up. Wu San also brought his men to chase after the carriage in a hurry, closely following it.
0:15:35|0:15:51|The 531 group followed closely, arrived in front of the carriage, and raised their bows and arrows ready to shoot. Unexpectedly, the archer in black was hit on the back of his hand by a small stone. Upon hearing the exclamation, the leader of the guards also ordered the team to stop.
0:16:16|0:16:29|The leader of the guards circled around, eyeing [Wu San], seemingly not believing what they were saying. [Wu San] looked nervous, afraid of being discovered. The leader of the guards then looked around, and [Wu San]'s fearful eyes darted around, noticing a loophole.
0:17:16|0:17:42|Wu San and his brothers were relieved to think they had fooled the leader of the guards. They kept muttering their thanks and then pushed each other, closely following the caravan of carriages. The group arrived at an inn, it was springtime, with willow trees swaying and the gentle spring breeze on their faces. The caravan stopped at the inn's entrance.
0:17:42|0:17:44|The flower girls comfort each other with their eyes.
0:18:12|0:18:14|Next, [Wu San] walked towards Lord Jun with a glass of wine.
0:18:53|0:19:8|Late at night, as everyone was getting ready to rest, only Rui Yu was staring at the candle in front of her, looking pensive. The flickering candlelight couldn't hide her troubled thoughts, as she furrowed her brow tightly.
0:19:8|0:19:33|She recalled everything that had happened in the past few days and thought of the crucial letter. She was about to take it out from her sleeve to read it when she was interrupted by the sudden entrance of Rui Yu. The Peony Pavilion girl shook her head, refused his proposal, and turned to the bed, picking up the tightly wrapped peony seedling.
0:19:33|0:19:38|Peony carefully brought the package containing the sapling over and placed it on the table, then opened it up.
0:19:40|0:19:59|The sisters saw her actions and couldn't sleep either, they all came to the table. The seedlings that were opened still looked well protected. Rui Yu touched the seedlings with her hand, and the sisters who had just suggested to escape lowered their heads in shame.
0:20:29|0:20:35|The peony lady gestures for her fourth sister to come closer to listen, while on the other side, Wu San and others are discussing the plan.
0:20:53|0:21:2|[Wu San] maliciously took out a small bottle from his pocket. The next moment, he cautiously walked out of the door. Unexpectedly, a pair of guards happened to pass by the doorway.
0:21:4|0:21:25|After the guard passed, the three of them sneaked out from the door one after another. In the room, the flower girls were still fast asleep, unaware that danger was approaching. The three of them quietly approached the door. A smoky bamboo pole quietly reached into the flower girls' room. Wu San was outside the window, blowing the sedative into the room with great effort.
0:21:25|0:21:33|The scent of the incense made the flower girls fall into a deep sleep. When there was no movement from them, Wu San and his men advanced towards their bedroom.
0:21:36|0:21:52|Suddenly, [Wu San] widened his eyes as if he had discovered something. It turned out to be the letter that had been guarded by the peony lady. [Wu San] held the letter close to his chest. Then, he kicked his brother next to him and gestured for him to leave quickly.
0:21:54|0:22:10|At this moment, before the sun had fully risen, [Rui Yu] and the others were walking along the deserted road when suddenly a long sword was thrust in front of them. A masked man slowly turned around, gazing sharply at [Rui Yu] and the others, while [Rui Yu] carefully observed the masked man.
0:22:24|0:22:34|[Wu San] saw that his brother was not his match, so he tried to shoot him with a sword, but the masked man dodged it and even kicked a stone that hit him.
0:22:44|0:22:50|The masked man slowly points the sword at the letter held by [Wu San], who instinctively hides the letter behind him.
0:22:54|0:23:10|The masked man dodged the package with a leap, leaving [Wu San] and his brothers stunned. He opened the letter without saying a word, angering [Wu San]. The masked man threw the letter on the ground and [Wu San] rushed towards him, only to see the masked man flying away.
0:23:13|0:23:24|Second Brother, with a wound on the back of his hand, was silently crying in pain. [Rui Yu] turned around and saw a letter dropped on the ground by a masked man, so she picked it up.
0:23:46|0:23:58|On the other side, Peony Flower Girl, unaware that the letter has been lost, is being escorted to the ancient county town by the guards. Unexpectedly, the gates of the ancient county town are tightly closed, with only guards standing on the city walls.
0:24:45|0:24:48|Wudang Flower Girl gets off the carriage.
0:25:8|0:25:26|After the leader of each guard finished the second sentence, [Rui Yu] turned around and walked away directly, leaving everyone unable to stop him, only able to watch him embark on his journey alone. His eyes were determined, as if he was not heading to a county plagued by an epidemic, but to a destination of travel. And so, he slowly walked through the city gate.
0:25:26|0:25:31|The 531 group arrived at the Wangye Mansion to report to [Da Cheng].
0:26:5|0:26:14|[Da Cheng] waved his hand and the thugs all left. [Wu San], who was originally kneeling on the ground, quickly walked to [Da Cheng]'s side, panting and asking for forgiveness.
0:26:41|0:26:49|In the ancient county town's street, there was only [Rui Yu] standing, his robe billowing in the wind.
0:26:53|0:27:2|The doors of each household were tightly closed, looking as if there were no living creatures inside. [Rui Yu] walked cautiously around, afraid that something might suddenly jump out.
0:27:4|0:27:24|He was unaware that someone was secretly watching him from the corner. [Rui Yu] arrived at a door and looked inside. Thick dust had accumulated on the windows, as if no one had lived there for a long time. [Rui Yu] helplessly walked back and forth on the street, trying to shout a few times.
0:27:28|0:27:31|Only the sound of birds chirping and a deathly silence greeted him.
0:27:33|0:27:38|At the gate of the mansion, the two brothers approached [Wu San] as soon as they saw him coming out, and [Wu San] also noticed them.
0:28:28|0:28:40|In an old mansion in the ancient county town, [Da Cheng] looked anxiously at the girl lying on the bed, who was his own daughter. The girl slowly opened her eyes.
0:29:20|0:29:23|In the midst of the conversation, a series of urgent knocks on the door could be heard. [Da Cheng] hurriedly came out of the room and approached the door, asking cautiously from inside.
0:29:42|0:29:59|Hearing the voice of a strange woman, [Da Cheng] peered through the crack in the door. [Da Cheng's Mom] relaxed for a moment, opened the door, and scrutinized [Rui Yu] with her eyes. He then leaned out and looked down the street to make sure there was really no one following [Rui Yu].
0:30:8|0:30:17|The two were talking when suddenly a noise came from inside the house. [Da Cheng] hurried back and found that his daughter had fallen to the ground.
0:31:12|0:31:33|Father Ying seemed to be skeptical, standing up and looking at [Rui Yu] with a doubtful look. [Rui Yu] nodded vigorously, causing Father Ying to take a step back and let her sit by Ying's bed. Seeing [Rui Yu] so sincere, [Da Cheng] also gained some trust in her and stood to the side watching her.
0:31:33|0:31:38|[Rui Yu] pulled up Yingzi's sleeve and saw that her arm was covered with dense red spots.
0:31:40|0:31:58|[Rui Yu] quietly holds the wheat, while Yingzi looks at her hopefully. [Rui Yu] frowns, sensing something is wrong, and sighs. Yingzi's father stands by, thinking all hope is lost. Yingzi struggles to keep her eyes open and weakly speaks.
0:32:3|0:32:21|Rui Yu didn't answer, she just smiled at him. She carefully put Yingzi's arm back under the blanket and tended to his feet. Yingzi's father hurried over to ask, Rui Yu hesitated for a moment, then, seeing the anxious look on the old man's face, she stood up from the bedside and led him aside.
0:32:32|0:32:48|Outside the ancient county town, [Wu San] and his group also arrived on horseback. Wu San noticed the notice on the wall and dismounted to take a look. However, he noticed something was amiss - it was a sunny day, but the surroundings seemed unusually quiet.
0:33:2|0:33:4|In the cabin, [Rui Yu] is treating [Ying Zi] for her illness.
0:33:16|0:33:34|At his fingertips, he slowly opens the handkerchief he carries with him, puts the petals inside into a clean bowl, then he takes off the hairpin from his head, pricks his finger to draw a drop of blood. Without any hesitation, he lets the blood from his fingertip drip down, and the petals reveal a faint glow.
0:33:38|0:33:58|He seems to be struggling, looking a bit weak. Beside him, [Yingzi] looks at him with pity as he continues to drip blood into the petals. When enough blood has dripped, [Rui Yu] also becomes pale. He picks up the blood-stained petals with his hands, clasps them tightly together, and bestows power upon the petals.
0:33:58|0:34:0|Then place the petals on Rui Yu's back covered with rashes.
0:34:8|0:34:28|He repeated this action again and again until all the petals were used up. His movements were gentle, and [Rui Yu] gradually felt no pain. The petals shimmered brightly in his hands, but with no sharp glare. This seemingly simple action actually required a great deal of effort.
0:34:28|0:34:36|[Rui Yu] did her best to treat Yingzi. After a long few hours, [Rui Yu] finally finished the entire process.
0:34:37|0:34:51|His forehead was covered with large beads of sweat, he was breathing heavily, trying to calm his body. Then he lifted the curtain and called for [Da Cheng's Dad] who was waiting outside.
0:35:25|0:35:37|This kind of evil poison is mostly spread through water sources, and if heavily poisoned individuals are not treated in time. The severe cases... [Rui Yu] seems to be in a difficult situation.
0:36:6|0:36:15|These petals come from a special source, which is probably hard to find among the common people.
0:36:53|0:36:57|[Rui Yu] took a deep breath, anxiously lowered her head, thinking of a solution.
0:37:17|0:37:28|Rui Yu nodded, with a smile on her pale face without any trace of blood. Outside the city's official residence temple, the leader of the guards and the flower girls were still anxiously waiting for Rui Yu, while the sisters were full of worry.
0:37:35|0:37:53|The 531 group somehow sneaked into the Guandi Temple without anyone noticing. They climbed over the wall and hid in a corner, peeping inside. The leader of the guards was devoutly worshiping Guan Yu, while Wu San and his brothers were patrolling the courtyard. The guard leader sensed something was wrong and looked around the temple.
0:37:53|0:38:0|Wu San and his brothers immediately hid behind the door when they saw him turn around, and only dared to peek out again after he left.
0:38:8|0:38:17|The guards chatted and chuckled, the leader of the guards patrolled around the temple and approached the sitting flower girl.
0:38:57|0:39:13|The leader of the guards moved his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but in the end, he didn't. However, Wu San, who was eavesdropping, heard the entire conversation and sneaked out from the wall. Da Cheng's Mom was startled by the sudden appearance of Wu San and Lao Er.
0:40:33|0:40:37|In the candlelight of the night, [Rui Yu] is holding a bowl of flower petals, stirring with the hairpin on her head.
0:40:41|0:40:55|The dim candlelight shone on her face, making her look particularly gentle. After finishing everything, she put the hairpin back on her head and handed the bowl to Yingzi. On the bed beside her, [Rui Yu] looked happily at her now smooth arms.
0:41:36|0:41:38|The 531 gang burst in with their faces covered.
0:42:11|0:42:29|The three were once again blocked by the masked hero from before. Before the words of the second and third could fall, they charged forward. Wu San tightly grabbed Rui Yu, afraid he would escape. The hero dodged left and right, avoiding the arrows shot by the second, and even wounded the third with his sword, then swiftly landed with a somersault.
0:42:30|0:42:47|Another leap, holding a sword and striking towards Wu San, only to be blocked. The hero then kicked Wu San down with force, and even cut off the bow and arrow of the second villain. [Rui Yu] anxiously watched as the hero took on two opponents alone. The second and third villains were no match for the hero at all, and even Wu San realized this.
0:42:48|0:43:5|Wu San, feeling angry, prepared to sneak attack the hero from behind. Rui Yu, seeing his underhanded move, broke free from Wu San and rushed forward to block the incoming sword. The hero turned around in shock, seeing Rui Yu injured. In an instant, the hero went into a rage, kicking Wu San and the other two men to the ground. The brothers then helped Wu San up.
0:43:8|0:43:14|The person hurriedly left without stopping, and when seeing the three people leaving, [Rui Yu] weakly fell into [Da Cheng]'s arms.
0:43:15|0:43:26|On the other side, Lord Ying and the county magistrate have found the leader of the guards, asking him to let Rui Yu stay a few more days. The guard leader hesitated and paced back and forth, pondering.
0:44:53|0:45:13|In a courtyard in the county, a woman is sewing clothes by candlelight. [Da Cheng's Mom] tightly closes the door, while on the other side, Yingzi and her father are also awake, waiting for news.
0:45:16|0:45:18|The masked hero's mother turned out to be Da Cheng's neighbor. The group of five, taking advantage of the dusk, ended up at the Guan Di Temple.
0:45:46|0:45:55|Wu San turned around and, in the deep darkness of the night, the statue in the Guandi Temple appeared eerie and terrifying, making him so scared that he swallowed hard.
0:46:15|0:46:22|In the midst of the conversation, [Wu San] pulled out an imperial decree from his bosom, looking smugly at the item in his hand.
0:46:39|0:46:43|Wu San curiously looked around at the contents of the imperial edict.
0:46:50|0:46:59|The next day, at the home of the masked hero, he is talking to his mother. He looks cautiously at the door to make sure no one is eavesdropping.
0:47:6|0:47:34|The hero relaxed, finally at ease. On the other side, [Rui Yu] slowly woke up from unconsciousness. Hearing Yingzi's exclamation, the two conversing immediately rushed in. [Rui Yu] looked around and saw Yingzi sitting by the bed, overjoyed. [Rui Yu] cast a grateful glance at Big Brother Tang.
0:47:43|0:47:53|Yingzi left happily, and Tangge gave a meaningful look to his mother, who immediately understood.
0:47:57|0:48:4|Seeing his mother leave with a smile, Tang Da Ge lifted his robe and sat down at the edge of [Rui Yu]'s bed, bowing his head to look at her.
0:48:9|0:48:29|Brother Tang suddenly paused, turned his head away, and realized he couldn't speak. He shook his head, disappointing [Rui Yu]. She then turned her eyes, seemingly thinking of something else.
0:48:35|0:48:49|[Rui Yu] finally relaxed and smiled gently. Tang Ge felt relieved when he saw her sweet smile. The two of them gazed at each other silently for a long time, creating a warm atmosphere in the air. However, [Rui Yu] still seemed to be anxious.
0:48:49|0:48:57|At this moment, Big Brother Tang's mother brought a bowl of porridge, smiled at her joyful son, and then turned to [Rui Yu].
0:49:6|0:49:28|He took the porridge from his mother's hand, gently stirred it to cool it down. After testing the temperature, he fed it to [Rui Yu] bit by bit. His mother Xianlian walked out, and before leaving, she turned back to look at the warm scene of the two, seeing her son being so good to [Rui Yu], she finally left with peace of mind.
0:49:28|0:49:33|In the ancient county town, a ragged beggar holding a broken bowl looked towards a shop on the street.
0:49:40|0:49:54|The gate was tightly closed. He pressed his ear against the door, listened to the movement inside, and, seeing no hope, walked away dejectedly. Then he turned around and saw a person coming down the street. He turned and ran towards the person on the street, holding out the broken bowl in his hand.
0:49:54|0:50:3|The man quickly shook his sleeves to drive away the beggar, as if afraid of getting contaminated by something unlucky. He had to start going door to door with a broken bowl to ask for help.
0:50:6|0:50:15|[Wu San] and his men arrived at the county government office on horseback, where the guards were strict. However, [Wu San] prohibited them from rushing in.
0:50:15|0:50:35|The guards at the door did not stop [Wu San]. Another wave of guards came out, [Wu San] waved the imperial decree in his hand, and the guards immediately stepped aside. He broke into the main hall directly, where there was no one. [Wu San] raised the imperial decree in his hand high, and the county magistrate and the leader of the guards came out only when they heard the noise, seeing [Wu San] who suddenly appeared at the door.
0:50:39|0:50:44|53 repeated it again, and everyone knelt down. He slowly opened the imperial edict, while Yingzi eavesdropped outside the door.
0:50:46|0:50:50|[Wu San] folded up the imperial edict, looking at the two with a triumphant smile.
0:51:55|0:51:57|Da Cheng's Mom looked at her son without any mistake.
0:52:2|0:52:6|The crowd fell into contemplation, when suddenly Da Cheng's Mom opened her eyes.
0:52:56|0:53:0|[Rui Yu] looked cautiously out the window and took off the hairpin from her head.
0:53:14|0:53:31|[Da Cheng] looked at [Rui Yu] tenderly, watching her shyly lower her head. At night, [Da Cheng] climbed onto the wall of the county office, made sure there were no guards at this time, then jumped into the courtyard and approached a door, quietly listening to the movements inside the house.
0:53:47|0:53:56|[Da Cheng] took out Rui Yu's hairpin from his pocket and handed it to the frightened flower girls. The leading flower girl took the hairpin and examined it carefully.
0:54:42|0:54:54|The flower girls looked at the peony seedlings, silently communicating with each other through their eyes, unsure whether to hand the seedlings over to [Rui Yu]. They nodded at each other and ultimately decided to hand over the seedlings.
0:55:7|0:55:15|The next day, during the day, the county magistrate paced anxiously in the yamen, while Chen Zhong on the side was also pondering countermeasures.
0:55:41|0:55:47|Given the situation, not teaching Miss [Rui Yu] might be... like this.
0:55:55|0:56:0|The county magistrate nodded in agreement with his approach. Chen Zhong then became worried about [Rui Yu]'s situation.
0:56:4|0:56:21|On the other side of the Lingyun Mountain, amidst the fragrant flowers and chirping birds, Yingzi and [Da Cheng] silently watched as [Rui Yu] cast a spell from afar. [Rui Yu] took out the hairpin from her head, pricked her fingertip until a drop of blood emerged. [Da Cheng] and Yingzi stood by quietly watching him.
0:56:23|0:56:42|Watching as [Rui Yu] stabbed her index finger with a hairpin, Yingzi and [Da Cheng] beside her felt very distressed. He let the blood drop onto the peony seedling, and once again, something magical happened. The withered peony seedling bloomed with brilliant flowers, blossoming on the branches.
0:56:42|0:56:52|[Da Cheng] turned away, unable to bear watching [Rui Yu] exhaust herself like this. But [Rui Yu] took a deep breath, steadied herself, and began casting a spell on the peony seedlings.
0:56:55|0:57:19|We saw him gently touching each blooming peony with his hands, infusing them with power. The peonies on the saplings bloomed vigorously, full of vitality, each as big as a baby's fist. Eagle Eye witnessed the entire process of [Rui Yu] casting spells, still in shock, with his mouth slightly open, unable to come to his senses for a long time.
0:57:19|0:57:23|[Da Cheng] also turned around and looked at the peonies watered with blood by [Rui Yu].
0:57:26|0:57:46|[Rui Yu] looked at the hard-earned results with satisfaction and smiled. She picked up a peony emitting a holy light from the branch, then looked at [Da Cheng] and Yingzi, extending her hands to hand the peony to them. Her face was filled with a contented smile.
0:58:12|0:58:19|[Rui Yu] and [Da Cheng] watched as Yingzi walked away. Overwhelmed with emotion, she collapsed weakly onto [Da Cheng].
0:58:27|0:58:39|[Rui Yu] woke up from unconsciousness, looked around in confusion, and saw herself still leaning on [Da Cheng]'s chest, but a bit further away from him. [Da Cheng] was just looking at [Rui Yu] with a worried expression, noticing her exhausted appearance.
0:59:35|0:59:41|[Da Cheng] looked admiringly at the determined face of [Rui Yu], what was blooming in his heart?
0:59:47|1:0:9|Rui Yu blushed and lowered her head shyly upon hearing such praise. She stole a glance at [Da Cheng] who was still staring straight at her. Hearing the sound of someone riding a horse approaching from afar, [Wu San] hiding in the bushes raised his bow and arrow, aiming at the man galloping towards them. He drew the bowstring taut, ready to release the arrow as soon as the man got closer.
1:0:13|1:0:32|[Wu San] shot an arrow, immediately knocking down the guard on the horse. Seeing that he succeeded, [Wu San] excitedly ran to the guard, first feeling his neck to confirm safety. Then he searched the guard's body and finally found something - a token.
1:0:32|1:0:52|Wu San tucked it into his arms and picked up the bow and arrow next to him, leaving. Up on the mountain, [Da Cheng] was sitting cross-legged, gazing at every plant and tree on the mountain. Under the sunlight, everything became gentle. [Rui Yu] was also enjoying the beautiful sunshine. She saw [Da Cheng] sitting there, and playfully laughed out loud.
1:0:52|1:1:6|She seemed to want to tease him. [Da Cheng] also turned his head and saw [Rui Yu], watching as he walked towards him. His gaze stayed on [Rui Yu], never leaving for a second. [Rui Yu] walked to [Da Cheng]'s side, and the two of them gazed at each other affectionately.
1:1:7|1:1:15|In an ambiguous atmosphere, it was finally [Da Cheng] who couldn't hold back and spoke first under [Rui Yu]'s gaze.
1:1:23|1:1:26|[Rui Yu] shyly smiles.
1:1:36|1:1:48|[Rui Yu] couldn't help but think again when she heard [Da Cheng]'s words. Seeing her smile, [Da Cheng] also embarrassedly lowered his head, and the two avoided eye contact. Suddenly, [Rui Yu] had a familiar feeling.
1:2:24|1:2:34|[Da Cheng] blurted out, and [Rui Yu] chuckled softly, feeling embarrassed herself. Looking at her simple and honest appearance, [Rui Yu] couldn't help but be amazed. The two locked eyes and sparks of love flew between them.
1:2:36|1:2:53|In the warm sunshine on the other side, the clinic in front of Yingzi's house is busy with consultations. A notice posted on the wall states that under the instructions of a divine doctor, the plague can be cured. The people are lining up in long queues, getting their pulses checked and receiving treatment. Yingzi consults the doctor while her father fetches medicine, creating a bustling scene.
1:3:12|1:3:33|Father Yingzi walked into the room and packed the medicinal herbs into a basket. These herbs all contain petals of peonies that were induced by blood from [Rui Yu]. Due to the large number of sick people, the medicine is almost running out, and there are many commoners waiting outside the clinic to receive their medicine.
1:3:33|1:3:52|The beggar who had been begging everywhere approached sneakily. Lao Er pretended to understand, nodded and wanted to stand up to leave, but then looked back at [Rui Yu] with a friendly expression.
1:4:16|1:4:24|Not finding the answer he wanted from the baby's mouth, [Wu San] quickly walked away.
1:4:56|1:5:8|Wu San took out the token he had taken from the guard earlier and handed it to [Wu San]. [Wu San] took it, rubbed it on his body, and stood up thoughtfully holding the token in his hand.
1:5:29|1:5:32|Rui Yu and Da Cheng exchanged a knowing look, as if they had suddenly realized something.
1:5:41|1:5:47|Wu San seemed reluctant to go. Upon asking, Da Cheng found out that at Rui Yu's home, Rui Yu and her father had finished a busy day.
1:6:22|1:6:39|Outside the door, Wu San overheard everything and quietly left. In the rainy mountain, [Rui Yu] was still unaware of the approaching danger, happily picking wildflowers. [Da Cheng] stood nearby, observing the surroundings. [Rui Yu] admired the wildflowers in her hands, carefully arranging them and holding them close to her chest.
1:6:39|1:6:45|[Da Cheng] is still patrolling around, guarding the safety of [Rui Yu]. In the distance, [Doctor Liu] walks up from the hillside.
1:7:33|1:7:35|[Rui Yu] pondered for a few seconds and then smiled, saying.
1:7:53|1:7:57|[Da Cheng] glanced at [Rui Yu], and both of them awkwardly avoided eye contact.
1:8:28|1:8:32|[Rui Yu] smiled, put down the embroidery in her hands, and looked at [Ying Zi].
1:8:46|1:8:54|[Rui Yu] remembered scenes from her childhood, in a dreamlike realm where an old man with floating dust would gently tap her head.
1:9:25|1:9:38|[Rui Yu] gradually immersed in memories of the past, the county magistrate paced anxiously, pondering how to handle the imperial decree, and worrying about them, while Chen Zhong looked into the distance, as if contemplating something.
1:10:28|1:10:34|While on the other side, [Yingzi] is twirling and dancing in [Rui Yu]'s dress, leaving [Da Cheng] stunned.
1:10:44|1:10:57|At this moment, [Da Cheng's Mom] was shuttling through the mountains, preparing to come and deliver a message to [Rui Yu] and [Da Cheng]. Suddenly, he heard footsteps in the distance, and upon closer inspection, it was [Wu San] and his group of soldiers marching towards them.
1:10:57|1:11:9|The army passed by, raising dust in the air. Leading the way, [Wu San] sat proudly on his horse. Yingzi's father secretly thought it was not good, quickening his pace up the mountain to inform the three of [Rui Yu], occasionally looking back to check [Wu San]'s position, making sure he was not being followed.
1:11:12|1:11:14|[Da Cheng] dropped the firewood in his hands and ran over.
1:11:25|1:11:27|Rui Yu's father was panting and couldn't speak.
1:12:11|1:12:17|Da Cheng's dad took a look at Da Cheng, who was wearing [Rui Yu]'s clothes, and came up with an idea. Da Cheng was also puzzled why his dad was looking at him like that.
1:12:37|1:12:43|Just have Yingzi dress up as you, and let the old car smoothly leave the ancient county town.
1:13:4|1:13:8|[Rui Yu] reluctantly agreed when he saw how sincere Yingzi's father was.
1:13:25|1:13:40|Unable to stop them in time, Yingzi and her father had already gone far away, leaving Da Cheng and Rui Yu to helplessly watch them embark on the adventure. Da Cheng looked at Rui Yu, who was full of regret but also helpless, continuously pounding on the tree trunk, unable to help but console her.
1:13:40|1:13:48|Rui Yu was moved to tears and hugged a tree trunk as Yingzi and her father disappeared into the bushes.
1:13:52|1:14:12|[Da Cheng] wanted to comfort her, but didn't know how to start. Meanwhile, [Wu San] was searching around for [Rui Yu]. Suddenly, Lao San seemed to have spotted the person he was looking for. Everyone looked in the direction he was pointing, and [Wu San] also saw it, quickly jumping off the horse to get a closer look.
1:14:18|1:14:23|On the other side in the distance, there is the figure of [Rui Yu] running, which shocks everyone.
1:14:42|1:14:55|Older Brother Two and Older Brother Three, who received the order, immediately took action, leading their subordinates to cross the river to capture [Rui Yu] and the person pretending to be [Rui Yu]. In the county town, Chen Zhong and the flower girls were also waiting for [Rui Yu] and the others to return, the flower girls gathered together and looked out of the carriage.
1:15:44|1:15:55|Chen Zhong nodded in agreement, while on the other side, the captors [Older Two] and [Older Three] returned empty-handed, back to [Wu San], panting heavily from exhaustion. [Older Two] and [Older Three] were too tired to speak.
1:16:0|1:16:20|[Wu San] angrily looked at the two of them, [Lao Er] and [Lao San] had to explain to [Wu San]. [Wu San] cursed and stood up, but suddenly realized that there was something strange about this matter.
1:16:31|1:16:48|Chen Zhong and the county magistrate negotiated for a while, finally compromised, and decided to deceive Wu San together. Yingzi hurriedly arrived wearing Rui Yu's clothes, trying her best to cover her face. The magistrate glanced at Chen Zhong, pretending not to recognize her, and the flower girls thought Yingzi was Rui Yu.
1:17:1|1:17:7|Yingzi turned around and saw Chen Zhong approaching. The flower girls were afraid she would be discovered, so they all blocked her with their bodies.
1:17:11|1:17:24|The carriage moved slowly, while [Da Cheng] on the other side brought Rui Yu back home. [Da Cheng] helped the weak Rui Yu into the house, and his mom quickly closed the door.
1:17:27|1:17:32|[Rui Yu] overheard the conversation between the mother and son, and became suspicious.
1:17:50|1:18:4|At night, Chen Zhongzheng rode a horse, escorting other flower girls and the disguised [Rui Yu] towards Luoyang. The quiet night made people feel uneasy, only the sound of horses passing by could be heard.
1:18:5|1:18:8|Yingzi only just realized that she had been discovered long ago.
1:18:18|1:18:23|The flower girls looked at each other and shook their heads, while Chen Zhong smiled sarcastically.
1:18:48|1:18:51|Dawn is approaching, as they turn around the bend ahead, they have reached the border of Luoyang again.
1:18:56|1:19:8|The group continued riding their horses, pushing forward under the cover of night. Inside the ancient county town, at [Da Cheng]'s home, he decided to confess his true identity to [Rui Yu]. After much hesitation, he finally made up his mind and spoke out.
1:19:21|1:19:28|Da Cheng encountered opposition from Lord Di. In response, he was deeply troubled and secretly colluded with rebels, intending to rebel.
1:19:31|1:19:33|Da Cheng holds a letter in his hand.
1:20:46|1:20:50|[Rui Yu] took out the letter from her pocket and handed it to [Da Cheng].
1:21:13|1:21:34|Mother, [Da Cheng] made sure of [Rui Yu]'s safety, picked up the sword and prepared to leave. In fact, he was still reluctant to part. [Da Cheng] understood the reluctance in [Rui Yu]'s eyes, the same reluctance he felt. [Da Cheng's Mom] pushed him to leave, only then did he turn around. [Rui Yu] watched [Da Cheng] walk away, leaning against the door frame with reluctance.
1:21:34|1:21:48|With a worried look on her face, Rui Yu was concerned about his departure, not knowing when they would meet again. The next day, Chen Zhong and the flower girl hurried on the road, arriving at a valley where the Five Three One gang suddenly rushed out from the roadside, armed with many weapons, and shouted, "Stop!"
1:22:21|1:22:26|Wu San looked smugly at Chen Zhong, thinking he was done for, but Chen Zhong remained unfazed.
1:22:34|1:22:45|Family members pulled the flower girl down from the carriage, and the flower girl shook off the hand holding her discontentedly. 英子, dressed in [Rui Yu]'s clothes, was pulled out from the crowd.
1:22:45|1:22:59|Wu San's face changed, he stepped forward and stared at Yingzi. He forcibly turned Yingzi's body around, examined his face closely, and scared Yingzi with his intense gaze, causing him to lower his head and then push him away. Wu San turned his head and looked at Chen Zhong, who was smiling brightly, only then did he realize that he had been fooled.
1:23:23|1:23:29|Chen Zhong blocked the knife falling from Wu San for Yingzi, and Wu San and Chen Zhong confronted each other, neither willing to give in.
1:23:33|1:23:48|[Wu San] saw that he couldn't beat Chen Zhong, so he signaled to Lao San. Lao San drew his knife and swung it fiercely at Ying Zi. Chen Zhong, seeing Ying Zi injured, kicked Wu San away and then knocked down Lao San with another kick. Ying Zi closed her eyes unwillingly.
1:23:58|1:24:20|At this moment, [Wu San] raised the imperial decree high, and Lao Er and Lao San quickly hid behind him. Chen Zhong stared blankly at the imperial decree, while [Wu San] stared at him threateningly. Everyone knelt down towards the imperial decree, and Chen Zhong slowly put down the sword in his hand. A look of conflict flashed across Chen Zhong's face, as he couldn't help but doubt whether his loyalty had gone wrong.
1:24:20|1:24:39|He weakly planted the sword into the ground and knelt down in front of [Wu San]. His soldiers also knelt down with Chen Zhong, and [Wu San] laughed wildly. The flower girls held the fallen Yingzi with dissatisfaction as they looked at [Wu San], but they were helpless against him. Yingzi lost his life like this and never woke up again.
1:24:39|1:24:46|In the empty palace, where secrets are as clear as water, conspiracies are revealed.
1:24:48|1:25:8|[Wu Zetian] appeared in the main hall, slowly walking towards the dragon throne with the help of the eunuch. Without saying a word, he sat down on the dragon throne, then turned his head to stare at [Da Cheng] kneeling on the ground. He then gestured with his hand, and the guards beside him came forward to pull him away.
1:25:8|1:25:18|The enemy listened to the begging of [Wu Cheng Temple] with great satisfaction. [Empress Wu] was deeply saddened by the actions of [Wu Cheng Temple], showing a pained expression. Then he pulled himself together.
1:25:20|1:25:25|[Da Cheng] heard the call from [Empress Wu Zetian], and walked into the hall majestically to pay his respects to her.
1:25:38|1:25:53|In the ancient county town, [Rui Yu] is treating the people. He takes the pulse of each patient, applies ointment for them, and instructs them on how to use the medicine. He patiently answers the questions of the patients who come for consultation, showing no signs of impatience.
1:25:53|1:26:6|Day after day, he never once complained of being tired. [Da Cheng's Mom] and Doctor Liu were also helping to treat the people, while [Da Cheng], who was always thinking day and night, was riding a horse with others on their way.
1:26:6|1:26:23|He rode a horse for thousands of miles to reunite with [Rui Yu], just for the two of them to meet sooner and for the villains to receive their deserved punishment. Unexpectedly, it was [Wu San] who led the soldiers into the city first, disrupting the peace of the small town. The people panicked and spontaneously gathered in front of the clinic.
1:26:24|1:26:32|Inside the house, [Rui Yu], [Da Cheng], and [Doctor Liu] heard the commotion outside and came out to see what was happening, only to find [Wu San] at the door.
1:26:36|1:26:49|Subordinate whispered to [Wu San], he nodded, the people gathered at the door of the clinic to protect [Rui Yu] and [Wu San]. [Wu San] looked disdainfully at the crowd gathered at the door, and walked up to threaten them.
1:26:58|1:27:0|The once quiet crowd suddenly became noisy.
1:27:19|1:27:33|Under Wu San's command, the scene instantly became chaotic, with the common people resisting the soldiers with their bodies. Rui Yu tried to push through the crowd to walk out. Seeing that the situation was almost out of control, County Magistrate Zhang approached Wu San, who looked at him askance.
1:27:56|1:28:0|Magistrate Zhang simply took off his official hat and answered him firmly.
1:28:25|1:28:30|Seeing that the people were not following orders, [Wu San] also panicked, took a deep breath, and shouted loudly at the crowd.
1:28:37|1:28:51|[Rui Yu] heard that the safety of the people was being threatened and wanted to come out, but was blocked. She pushed through the crowd in front of her and walked out without hesitation. She stood still in front of the crowd, facing [Wu San] directly. When [Wu San] saw her, he smirked.
1:29:8|1:29:23|The crowd got into a fight with the soldiers brought by [Wu San] to protect [Rui Yu]. [Wu San] could no longer control the situation at the banquet and signaled to his subordinate upstairs to act quickly. Without hesitation, the subordinate shot an arrow towards [Rui Yu], piercing straight into his chest.
1:29:24|1:29:43|[Rui Yu] fell to the ground, landing in the arms of [Da Cheng's Mom], clutching her chest. Despite the bright sunlight, her face was pale, struggling to breathe. On the side, [Wu San] was secretly pleased, but at that moment, Da Cheng ran up and said.
1:30:0|1:30:21|Second Brother grabbed something and ran, but it was already too late. Everyone beat up Second Brother, and at that moment, [Da Cheng] finally returned from the capital on horseback. Seeing [Rui Yu] injured, [Da Cheng] quickly dismounted from his horse, crouched down beside him, and looked at him with concern.
1:30:25|1:30:41|[Da Cheng] looked at [Rui Yu], who had fainted, in disbelief, his steps becoming heavier. He squatted down, gently holding [Rui Yu]'s hand, feeling her warmth, trying to wake her up.
1:30:44|1:31:6|On the side, the bystanders looked at them with great sorrow, wiping their eyes with their sleeves. Upon hearing [Da Cheng]'s voice, [Rui Yu] forcefully opened her eyes, but she had no strength left to speak. She managed to squeeze out a smile towards [Da Cheng] with difficulty. [Rui Yu] could no longer speak, only able to look at [Da Cheng] with her eyes.
1:31:6|1:31:10|She understood [Rui Yu]'s meaning and took out an imperial decree from her bosom to show him.
1:31:16|1:31:42|[Da Cheng] stood up, holding the imperial decree and gesturing to the people around him. Everyone looked at him. He shouted loudly with authority, and the commoners all knelt down. [Rui Yu] was also lying in the arms of [Da Cheng's Mom], gazing at him. He opened the decree and read it aloud to the kneeling villagers and the motionless [Rui Yu].
1:32:8|1:32:26|[Rui Yu] heard about the reward for herself and smiled with satisfaction. Being honored as the Peony Fairy, [Rui Yu] was willing to use her own flesh and blood to help the suffering people. Her spirit floated lightly everywhere, sprinkling her fresh blood all around.
1:32:26|1:32:35|Petals fluttered around her, even her dress was adorned with flowers. Her eyes were slightly lowered, and the earth revived because of the magic she spread.
1:32:37|1:32:41|Da Cheng is calling out to him in the distance.
1:32:45|1:32:59|The fairy who came to relieve the people's suffering. [Rui Yu] floated lightly into [Da Cheng]'s arms, held his hand, and gazed at him with gentle eyes.
1:33:26|1:33:44|[Da Cheng] knew that [Rui Yu] was so kind-hearted. His eyes flickered, but he couldn't say any words of dissuasion. Then, [Rui Yu] leaned tightly against [Da Cheng]'s shoulder. In the vast world, only the two of them remained quietly like this, hoping that time could freeze at this moment.
1:33:44|1:33:53|The people eventually sculpted a statue for [Rui Yu], so that he could forever guard this land. Hundreds of years later, in a scenic area in Luoyang City, tourists were admiring the blooming peonies.
1:34:10|1:34:13|Rui Yu, who is close to giving birth, is also enjoying the peonies.
1:34:19|1:34:22|The white peony that everyone is seeing now.
1:34:36|1:34:45|[Da Cheng] is using his brush to depict the peony in front of him, while [Rui Yu] also walks over here. However, the focused [Da Cheng] doesn't notice her.
1:34:45|1:34:56|[Rui Yu] smiled and looked at the peony in front of her, then bent down to pick up a petal from the flower pond. She held up the petal to the sunlight, the petal still carrying water droplets, looking clean and transparent.
1:34:57|1:35:15|He looked at the petals, his eyelashes long and fluttering as the wind gently blew, occasionally lifting his hair. Then, [Rui Yu] placed the petals on his nose, delicate, as if trying to smell the scent of old memories from within. At this moment, [Da Cheng] finally noticed [Rui Yu], who was standing beside the elegant peony.
1:35:15|1:35:27|[Rui Yu] also felt a hot gaze, turned to look at [Da Cheng]. [Da Cheng] stared straight at [Rui Yu], as if he had seen this person somewhere before. However, the other person avoided his gaze and walked away.
1:35:28|1:35:41|[Da Cheng] saw [Rui Yu] leaving and hurried to catch up. At this moment, [Rui Yu] was looking up carefully, admiring a section of the rock wall. On the rock wall were finely carved peonies, suddenly, a figure stood in front of her.
1:35:41|1:35:56|[Rui Yu] looked up and saw [Da Cheng] running towards him, panting heavily, while he was silently watching him. A friendly smile from [Rui Yu] confirmed the mutual understanding between them. The two walked towards each other along the stone monument, with [Da Cheng] never taking his eyes off [Rui Yu].
1:35:57|1:36:13|He slowly approached [Rui Yu], looking at her familiar and beautiful face. When [Rui Yu] heard [Da Cheng] calling her name, she smiled gently at him. Seeing [Rui Yu] responding to his call, [Da Cheng] also showed a smile as if he had found a treasure.
1:36:14|1:36:26|[Rui Yu] lowered his head and brought out a handful of peonies from behind, which had witnessed their love. He held the peonies up to [Da Cheng], who looked at him knowingly.
1:36:26|1:36:37|[Rui Yu] vigorously throws the peony petals into the sky, and the petals fall all over their shoulders as they watch them drift down.
