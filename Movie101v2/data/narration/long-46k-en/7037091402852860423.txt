0:1:9|0:1:25|She skillfully pulled the handbrake to park the car at the door, then picked up the cloth in front of the steering wheel, opened the door and got out of the car. [Zhou Qimiao] said as she opened the car door, [Miao's Dad] glanced up drowsily, then closed the car door heavily and fell back asleep.
0:1:25|0:1:36|[Zhou Qimiao], as if already accustomed to [Miao's Dad]'s laziness, lifted her leg and jumped onto the back of the truck, struggling to move the full fish barrel, and then lifted the fish barrel and placed it on the ground. At this time, the market was crowded with people buying things.
0:1:43|0:1:52|[Miao's Dad] impatiently scolds the woman blocking his way, then pushes his cart to his fish-selling stall, only to find it cluttered with someone else's belongings.
0:1:55|0:2:11|[Qimiao] looked at the foam box with "Rich and Fresh Fish" written on it, glanced angrily at the sign across the street with the same words, while [Pork Guy] sharpened his knife nearby. Upon hearing the woman's words, [Pork Guy] looked confusedly at the pig head hanging next to him.
0:2:11|0:2:19|The other party saw that he was not moving at all, and gestured towards him. He cut a small piece with a knife and put it in a bag.
0:2:34|0:2:52|[Miao's Dad] shouted as he threw the foam box containing the rich and fresh fish packaging into the neighboring rich and fresh fish stall. The nearby stall owner was frightened and fled, while the people buying things were talking about it.
0:3:28|0:3:47|At this moment, the customers in Fugui Market were inexplicably driven away by the stall owner. [Miao's Dad] walked over to [Qimiao] and said, [Qimiao] turned around, only to see a man with curly hair swaggering in. The man stopped at the Fugui Fresh Fish stall, looked up at the fallen sign, and then questioned his sidekick.
0:4:6|0:4:13|The man with a fierce demeanor shook off [Miao's Dad]'s hand and stood in front of [Zhou Qimiao]. [Zhou Qimiao] lifted her head and met the man's fierce gaze directly. Then the man said,
0:4:16|0:4:34|[Zhou Qimiao] finished speaking, the man glared at her, bent down to pick up a white eel from the nearby water tank. Then he stood up straight and threw the white eel on the ground. [Zhou Qimiao] frowned at this scene. The man took out 50 yuan from his pocket, then threw the money fiercely on the cutting board. [Zhou Qimiao] lowered her head and glanced at it, then she grabbed the white eel from the ground.
0:4:46|0:4:54|The tense standoff was interrupted by the arrival of a middle-aged man wearing glasses, followed by some henchmen.
0:5:20|0:5:34|After being scolded by Zhou Qimiao, the man looked up fiercely and stared at Ah Miao, Zhou Qimiao, who was standing opposite him. He then turned his head and patted Pork Guy's chest before walking to the side. He then walked to the other side and asked, then he wiped his face with his hand after being sprayed with saliva.
0:5:46|0:6:8|After saying that, [Zhou Qimiao] pushed the man aside and walked out. The man looked at her with dissatisfaction, then turned his gaze back to Qimiao [Zhou Qimiao] at the stall with a cold and indifferent look, as if shooting out icy glares. At night, the Fortune Market was quiet, and a faint light suddenly flashed in the dark alley. Two people holding flashlights were seen bending over as they walked in. They stopped in front of Qimiao's stall, with one hand holding a big hammer ready to smash the circuit breaker on the wall.
0:6:8|0:6:18|[Pork Guy] swung his hand and hit the man, who then dumped the garbage into Qimiao's stall and said to [Pork Guy],
0:6:28|0:6:32|[Pork Guy] couldn't resist the man's demands, so he had to turn around and do as he was told.
0:6:39|0:6:47|[Miao's Dad] walked up to Qimiao with his arm around a woman.
0:6:58|0:7:16|[Miao's Dad] lifted the plastic sheet, opened another compartment of the safe, took out some money from inside, and without looking back, said. Helplessly, Miao watched her father and the woman walk away. [Pork Guy] frowned when he saw this.
0:7:22|0:7:37|[Pork Guy] watched as Qimiao, who was selling fish porridge on the roadside, remained silent. A customer stood up, handed her the money, and left. Qimiao then picked up the bowl and chopsticks to clean up. At that moment, [Pork Guy] quietly walked over from behind the car and greeted Qimiao.
0:7:56|0:8:10|The man cursed from the window across the street, then put down the blinds and walked away. [Pork Guy] awkwardly said, "Ah Miao nodded and handed out the fish porridge, forcing a smile." [Pork Guy] also stood there dumbly, smiling.
0:8:25|0:8:46|After receiving a response, [Pork Guy] left with a smile on his face. In the dimly lit street, only Qimiao was left tidying up the messy stall. She neatly leaned the tables and chairs against the fence by the roadside, then turned off the overhead light. Qimiao opened the car door and sat inside, furrowing her brows and tilting her tired neck. She then took the coat on the car seat to the other side, adjusted the pillow, and lay down.
0:8:46|0:8:58|The environment in the car was slightly cold, and she picked up the coat next to her and covered herself with it, then slowly closed her eyes. The next morning, the seafood market vendors filled the campsite with foam boxes full of seafood, waiting for the vendors to come and stock up.
0:9:17|0:9:27|[Fish Guy] looked at Qimiao in front of him with a face full of resentment. Qimiao pushed the small cart filled with fresh live fish and walked outside. The sidekick next to him muttered,
0:9:37|0:9:55|[Fish Guy] greeted others while walking towards the stalls. He saw [Zhou Qimiao]'s stall lit up and ready for business. Just as he was stunned, he then noticed his own stall filled with garbage. Angered, he marched towards his stall, looked down at the mess, and then quickly went inside to inspect. By now, the electrical box was already broken into pieces.
0:9:55|0:10:2|He took another step forward and unexpectedly stepped on a pile of dog poop the next second. His sidekick next to him said,
0:10:22|0:10:28|Knowing that his misdeeds were exposed, [Fish Guy] glared fiercely at [Pork Guy], then immediately rushed over.
0:11:51|0:12:20|The child pointed backwards and ran away. [Zhou Qimiao] walked up with flowers in hand and said, then she gestured with the flowers in front of the two. [Pork Guy] stood awkwardly with his hands in his pockets, [Fish Guy] took the flowers ungraciously and threw them into [Pork Guy]'s arms. [Fish Guy] rolled his eyes at [Zhou Qimiao]'s back, raised his hand to comfort [Pork Guy], who impatiently shook off [Fish Guy]'s hand, trying hard to hold back tears. [Fish Guy] also felt uneasy watching this scene.
0:12:20|0:12:35|That afternoon, [Miao's Dad] brought [Qimiao] to the entrance of a coffee shop. After a moment of contemplation, [Qimiao] said,
0:12:40|0:12:49|At this moment, one hand holding a spoon kept stirring the coffee on the table, followed by another hand appearing in the frame, making the same movement. [Zhou Qimiao] sat across from the man in a suit and took the initiative to ask,
0:13:11|0:13:31|The brief conversation ended, and the two fell into silence again, looking down at the coffee on the table. They both spoke their minds at the same time. [Zhou Qimiao] smiled and shyly lowered her head. She glanced up at the suit-wearing man with a smile and said, at this moment, the man in the suit couldn't contain his inner joy.
0:14:1|0:14:15|That night, the top floor of Fugui Market was brightly lit, with four small round tables filled with people. Everyone gathered to celebrate the happy occasion of an elderly couple in love at sunset. The two elders were dressed in wedding attire, their faces beaming with smiles. [Chicken Guy] turned to kiss [Cai Po] on the cheek, while [Miao's Dad] shamelessly planted a kiss on his old sweetheart sitting beside him.
0:14:26|0:14:37|At this moment, [Pork Guy] suddenly raised his glass and drank it all, then he stood up and said, supporting [Fish Guy]'s shoulder and standing on the stool, shouting loudly,
0:14:40|0:14:47|The crowd sighed in unison as [Cai Po] helped the swaying [Chicken Guy] walk up to [Pork Guy].
0:15:16|0:15:18|[Pork Guy] finished speaking, smiled at [Zhou Qimiao], and then turned and walked away.
0:16:41|0:16:53|[Biscuit Guy] glanced at [Fish Guy] who was snatching flowers on the side, took out a box from the lower compartment and handed it to [Zhou Qimiao]. [Zhou Qimiao] pretended not to see it, turned and asked. Seeing no response from [Zhou Qimiao], [Fish Guy] snatched the box and squeezed the biscuits outwards.
0:16:56|0:17:4|[Zhou Qimiao] immediately followed [Fish Guy] to escape from this awkward place. The customers next to them kept urging, while [Biscuit Guy] behind them could only watch them leave with wide eyes.
0:17:5|0:17:20|At this moment, everyone in Fugui Market is sitting on the rooftop eating biscuits. After the men finish eating, they struggle to stand up. A child sitting nearby suddenly clutches his stomach and says, causing a woman to immediately drop the biscuit in her hand and run outside. Meanwhile, sitting down, [Miao's Dad] laboriously swallows the biscuit and says,
0:17:22|0:17:30|After he finished speaking, he stood up and his girlfriend stood up as well. The two of them left hand in hand. The others also left the rooftop one after another, leaving only [Zhou Qimiao] and [Fish Guy] sitting there eating biscuits.
0:17:30|0:17:38|At this moment, [Fish Guy], who was too full to speak, patted [Zhou Qimiao]'s leg, pointed to his pocket, and [Zhou Qimiao] set the biscuit aside, took out an envelope from his pocket, and opened it.
0:18:55|0:19:2|[Zhou Qimiao]'s attitude left [Fish Guy] speechless. He rolled his eyes at [Zhou Qimiao] and threw away the leftover pastry in his hand.
0:19:13|0:19:36|[Zhou Qimiao] didn't even look at what [Fish Guy] was holding in his hand. She was chewing on a biscuit, turned her head to look into the distance, snatched the bracelet from [Fish Guy]'s hand and threatened him. At this moment, a 1998 calendar appeared in the scene with a fly resting on it. [Fish Guy] swatted the fly with a fly swatter. Nearby, the vendors were gathered playing cards. He walked over and said.
0:19:39|0:19:45|Miao sat on the side playing with makeup with other women, her hands already wearing the bracelet given by [Biscuit Guy].
0:19:58|0:20:5|Qimiao's pupils dilated as she listened, the smile fading from her face.
0:20:14|0:20:36|Zhou Qimiao extended her index finger to her lips, staring at herself in the mirror as she awkwardly wiped it with her finger, then pursed her lips. Zhou Qimiao was admiring herself in the mirror when Fish Guy suddenly ran over to look at her lips. Zhou Qimiao covered her mouth with a tissue and stood up to leave, but Fish Guy stopped her, laughing incessantly.
0:20:42|0:20:49|Fish Guy led the vendors from Fugui Market into a large supermarket with great momentum. At that moment, the fruit vendor stood still in the fruit section.
0:20:54|0:21:5|The vendor selling [Pork Guy] slid to his knees in front of the meat counter, and [Fish Guy] saw the vegetable vendor running towards the vegetable area and immediately followed.
0:21:14|0:21:21|The scene shifts to the neatly arranged fresh fish in the freezer. Qimiao stands still, staring at the scene in front of her. The stall owner is wearing a mask and handling the fish. Suddenly, Fish Guy rushes over and grabs one person by the collar, shouting.
0:21:34|0:21:41|[Fish Guy] gritted his teeth and walked out, standing in front of Cai Yu Yu, with the other stall owners following immediately.
0:21:55|0:22:18|Early the next morning, [Fish Guy] wearing a sanitary hat nailed the signboard with job assignments on the wall of the Fu Gui Market. As soon as he finished speaking, two rows of neatly arranged shopping carts parked by the wall. Customers who had been here before felt slightly uncomfortable as they entered the transformed Fu Gui Market. Various promotional slogans on the stalls caught their attention, and the stall owners were displaying fresh fruits on the cutting board.
0:22:56|0:23:10|The woman's face changed immediately after hearing that, she stared, bent down to take out the items she had just put in the shopping cart, while Qimiao smiled and greeted the others.
0:23:29|0:23:38|The woman casually took a bottle from the bottom of the beer tower, only to see the next moment a stack of beers falling to the ground. She looked around nervously, pushed her shopping cart and quickly left.
0:23:46|0:23:56|In this scene, a simple card reader appears. [Miao's Dad] inserts the card and swipes it forcefully, only to have the card fly out the next second. The woman impatiently takes out the money and throws it on the table.
0:24:4|0:24:11|[Miao's Dad] fell silent for a moment, then he walked to the door holding a woman's belongings and threw them on the ground.
0:25:23|0:25:32|Qimiao pours the prepared fish ingredients into the pot and stirs, then she flips the fried noodles in the iron pot next to her.
0:25:38|0:25:46|Miao put down the shovel in her hand and ran to the other side to scoop up the sesame paste. At this moment, [Fish Guy] appeared next to the stall, secretly watching Miao's busy figure with a hint of tenderness in his eyes.
0:25:52|0:26:6|Qimiao turned around and found [Fish Guy]. She hesitated for a moment, then went to get the fried noodles. [Fish Guy] saw that she completely ignored him, so he helplessly pursed his lips. He then quietly opened Qimiao's password box, took out the notebook on top, glanced at Qimiao who was turning away, and opened it.
0:26:42|0:26:50|Fish Guy, who knew he was in the wrong, lowered his head and then walked up to Qimiao, who was busy working, and said.
0:26:53|0:26:58|[Fish Guy] looked helplessly at Qimiao who was still eating non-stop in front of him, then he pointed to the fish porridge in the pot.
0:27:10|0:27:18|Fish Guy's competitive spirit was aroused by Qimiao's words. He grumpily took out the money from his pocket and handed it to Qimiao.
0:27:43|0:27:52|Fish Guy, at a loss, could only stare blankly at the urban management in front of him. The next morning, he went to Pork Guy's house, where Pork Guy opened a beer and sat down, saying.
0:28:2|0:28:10|[Fish Guy] opened the door, only to see Qimiao rushing in and asking, while [Pork Guy] chuckled and said,
0:28:50|0:29:2|[Fish Guy] pointed at Qimiao sitting on the sofa. Qimiao, unwilling to show weakness, turned her head to [Pork Guy] for help. [Pork Guy] glanced at her without saying a word, just helplessly spread his hands, then picked up a beer from the side to ease the awkward atmosphere.
0:29:2|0:29:8|Qimiao glared angrily at [Fish Guy], who stared back at her arrogantly with his head held high.
0:29:14|0:29:27|After Miao slammed the door and left, [Pork Guy] couldn't help but chuckle at the scene. The next morning, on the misty street, Miao was running frantically in her rain boots, her apron still on and flapping in the wind. Pedestrians passing by couldn't help but watch as Miao sped ahead.
0:29:27|0:29:35|Upon reaching the destination, she immediately opened the door and ran upstairs. In the hallway, two men waiting outside the door looked at Qimiao, who was ringing the doorbell, with confusion.
0:29:51|0:30:3|Miao looked up at [Fish Guy] standing beside her, who avoided eye contact and didn't dare to meet her gaze.
0:30:4|0:30:10|[Fish Guy] pushed Qimiao aside and walked over to slap [Miao's Dad].
0:30:13|0:30:22|Later, Qimiao walked with [Miao's Dad] on the back of [Fish Guy], watching [Fish Guy] who was actively helping. She didn't know what to say. [Fish Guy] struggled to carry [Miao's Dad] up the stairs. Then she said,
0:30:56|0:31:13|With [Miao's Dad] on his back finally shutting up, Miao looked at the now manly [Fish Guy], a smile unconsciously forming on her lips. Both [Fish Guy] and [Miao's Dad] turned to look at Miao, feeling a surge of power for some reason in the face of Miao's gratitude. Carrying [Miao's Dad] on his back, [Fish Guy] ascended the stairs once again.
0:31:18|0:31:32|After hearing this, Ah Miao took off the bracelet and handed it to him, saying, "[Fish Guy]" took it from her hand and said. "[Fish Guy]" moved the drink over and stood up.
0:32:23|0:32:32|At this moment, the two of them are no longer the enemies they used to be. They sit at the dining table teasing each other, their attitudes towards each other have changed. The camera gradually pulls away, shrinking the figures of the two talking in the room.
0:32:32|0:32:43|Through the window, you can see the mottled walls outside. With the broadcast sound of the changing day and night and the development of the times, the camera starts to rotate, then stops again at the window of [Fish Guy]'s room, and the camera slowly zooms in.
0:32:43|0:32:58|Until she passed through the window, [Zhou Qimiao] was seen inside the house, carrying a stack of comic books and walking towards the bookshelf. She struggled to hold the comic books and then slowly placed them neatly on the shelf. At this moment, [Fish Guy] came in from outside and looked at the spotless room in front of him. He even began to doubt if he had walked into the wrong place.
0:33:0|0:33:6|[Zhou Qimiao] finished speaking and turned to walk into the kitchen. [Fish Guy] slowly walked in, looking at the clean floor and tidy sofa in front of him. He shouted.
0:34:26|0:34:44|The saleswoman handed the handbag to her with a stern face, and [Zhou Qimiao] happily took it and walked towards the mirror. As she walked, she stuffed money into the handbag, then she put the handbag into her jacket pocket. She stood up, smiled at the mirror, and then took the handbag out of her pocket, looking like she was paying for something. The saleswoman next to her impatiently said.
0:37:8|0:37:15|Feeling something off about the man she was holding, she looked up and immediately pushed him away.
0:37:48|0:38:1|In the dead of night, the streets were eerily quiet. Suddenly, [Fish Guy] ran towards Fugui Market as if he had gone mad. Meanwhile, a lost and confused [Zhou Qimiao] was wandering on the top floor of Fugui Market. Seeing [Zhou Qimiao]'s appearance, [Fish Guy] quickly climbed the stairs in three steps.
0:38:17|0:38:33|[Fish Guy] dared not provoke her, so he stood opposite and tried to persuade her. [Zhou Qimiao] looked at the man in front of her expressionlessly. Suddenly, [Zhou Qimiao] burst into laughter. Beside her, [Fish Guy] widened his eyes in fear and looked at her. Then, [Zhou Qimiao] laughed heartily at the edge of the rooftop, causing [Fish Guy] to slowly move closer.
0:39:8|0:39:29|[Fish Guy] slapped her face hard, and the agitated [Zhou Qimiao] finally calmed down. She looked at the stunned [Zhou Qimiao] standing there like a lifeless statue. As [Fish Guy] lowered his hand and gasped for breath, [Zhou Qimiao] slowly raised her head. At this moment, the image of [Fish Guy] in her eyes went from blurry to clear. She looked down towards the ground in a daze, her eyes gradually filled with fear.
0:39:40|0:39:46|[Zhou Qimiao] clung to [Fish Guy] and desperately burrowed into his arms, while [Fish Guy] held her tightly, still needing to protect the girl in his arms.
0:39:56|0:40:10|The two of them sat hugging each other in place, with [Fish Guy] embracing Ah Miao in his arms, a smile unconsciously appearing on his face. The next morning, [Fish Guy] sat on the sofa wrapping a small box with a newspaper.
0:40:12|0:40:23|The poster reads "Romance can be carefully cultivated, moving moments come from the bits of life." Then he took another notebook and imitated Ah Miao to stick a sticky note on the cover, which reads: [Fish Guy] 32 years old, Miao 29 years old.
0:40:23|0:40:29|At this moment, Qimiao is sitting at home, she opens the safe and takes out a few hundred yuan, while Miao's Dad is lying on the sofa laughing foolishly.
0:40:38|0:40:47|Miao threw the phone at her dad, but it rang again. She grabbed it and shouted,
0:41:3|0:41:15|Qimiao hung up the phone expressionlessly and walked away. Miao's Dad sighed and stood up from the sofa, then walked over to sit beside Qimiao.
0:41:17|0:41:25|Miao puts the luncheon meat representing [Pork Guy] aside.
0:41:31|0:41:38|At this moment, Qimiao didn't rush to clear her name, but instead, she stared at the decoration symbolizing [Fish Guy] in front of her, deep in thought. Miao's Dad then picked up the decoration and threw it into the trash can.
0:42:21|0:42:44|At this moment, [Fish Guy] saw Qimiao wearing a dress, his mouth half open in surprise. [Fish Guy] looked at the unusually colored Qimiao, who kept looking at him and [Pork Guy]. Then she quickly ran to the taxi, opened the door and got in. [Fish Guy] paid no attention to what [Pork Guy] was saying, he stared at the direction the taxi was leaving, feeling somewhat uneasy.
0:42:45|0:42:53|At this moment, Zhou Qimiao sat in a restaurant, fixing her hair through the reflection of the mirror. Then she turned around and saw the waiter approaching with a plate.
0:42:58|0:43:6|The waiter put down the tableware and turned to look for a mirror. Zhou Qimiao raised her hand to adjust her clothes, while Fish Guy was observing her from his car not far away.
0:43:15|0:43:23|The [Biscuit Guy] outside smiled and greeted her as he walked towards the shop, while [Fish Guy] mumbled something in his mouth when he saw [Biscuit Guy].
0:44:1|0:44:17|Fish Guy, sitting in the car at this moment, looked puzzled at Zhou Qimiao chatting enthusiastically inside the house. After the conversation ended, Zhou Qimiao immediately went to the mall. Zhou Qimiao frowned, then pointed to a wallet in the display case and asked,
0:44:25|0:44:33|The saleswoman handed her the wallet with a cold face, and she looked at the wallet she didn't like in anger. Then [Zhou Qimiao] arrived at a restaurant.
0:45:0|0:45:14|He avoided eye contact with [Zhou Qimiao] and continued speaking. [Zhou Qimiao] nodded silently in response. [Zhou Qimiao] gave a simple reply and fell silent, while [Pork Guy] across from him sipped his drink and looked at him.
0:45:14|0:45:22|At this moment, [Zhou Qimiao] was already absent-minded, with a cloud of worry on his face. [Pork Guy] also felt awkward to stay any longer. He put down his drink and looked around before finally saying to [Zhou Qimiao],
0:45:22|0:45:40|[Pork Guy] nodded at [Zhou Qimiao], relieved, and got up from the chair. [Zhou Qimiao] watched his departing figure, then quickly took out her phone from her pocket and dialed a number. Putting the phone to her ear, she said,
0:45:52|0:46:10|[Zhou Qimiao] responded with a sound and walked by the bookshelf, while [Fish Guy] was checking the mail on the side. Unable to bear it, she casually tidied up the randomly placed comic books. Suddenly, she stopped her hand movement, looked up at the upper wall inside the bookshelf, holding a comic book in one hand and lowering her head to look inside. After seeing what it was, her eyes widened more and more.
0:46:10|0:46:27|At this moment, [Fish Guy] held the found mail in his hand, quickly glanced back at [Zhou Qimiao], and then pretended to continue searching. Suddenly, the notebook that was pressed underneath appeared in front of him, with a sticky note stating the ages of 32 for [Fish Guy] and 29 for [Zhou Qimiao] particularly noticeable. [Zhou Qimiao] turned to look at [Fish Guy], then sneakily moved over to take the notebook down.
0:46:27|0:46:42|[Fish Guy] also found the box wrapped in a poster before. He held it in his hands and rubbed it happily. At this moment, [Zhou Qimiao] opened the first page of the notebook and was even more surprised after seeing the contents inside. It said, "Becoming a person worthy of marrying without looking for Afeng." [Fish Guy] walked over holding an envelope and said,
0:46:46|0:46:51|He grabbed Zhou Qimiao's arm and then reached out the hand behind his back, handing over the wrapped notebook.
0:47:9|0:47:18|[Fish Guy] smiled as he handed her the box, and when Miao opened it, she found a brand new wallet inside. She looked up in confusion at [Fish Guy], who was now sheepishly grinning.
0:47:29|0:47:37|Seeing the smiling [Fish Guy], Qimiao walked over and took the notebook that was underneath. [Fish Guy] immediately stood up when he saw it, then Qimiao walked over and handed him the notebook.
0:47:54|0:48:5|After he finished speaking, he looked at Qimiao with a smile, his eyes filled with anticipation. [Fish Guy] smiled awkwardly in response.
0:48:10|0:48:15|[Fish Guy] looked at Qimiao with a wandering gaze and remained silent. At this moment, Qimiao spoke again,
0:48:23|0:48:46|Watching [Fish Guy] with a look of disappointment on his face at this moment, Zhou Qimiao didn't know how to handle it. After hesitating for a long time, she turned around and left. [Fish Guy] took a few heavy steps forward, then suddenly Zhou Qimiao turned back and handed over her wallet. He looked at the wallet and waved his hand, saying something. Zhou Qimiao had no choice but to take the gift back.
0:48:47|0:49:2|Fish Guy, who was standing still, never had the courage to look in the direction where Qimiao left. He then lowered his head and looked at the notebook in his hand. Qimiao walked out of Fish Guy's room, leaning against the door with a vacant look in her eyes. Her resolute rejection may have already hurt Fish Guy, but she didn't know how to make amends.
0:49:2|0:49:14|In the room, [Fish Guy] silently picked up the torn poster wrapping paper and casually threw it on the coffee table. He sat on the sofa with a heavy heart, looking around at everything. Then he lowered his head and opened his notebook.
0:49:14|0:49:20|After seeing his own ridiculous message, he slammed the phone down hard. At this moment, the scene cuts to a table in the gambling den.
0:49:31|0:49:45|Miao's Dad placed the character tile in front of himself, picked up a tile and rubbed it with his thumb. Then he reached for another tile, looking tense with furrowed brows. He gazed at the tile in his hand with a vacant expression, glanced around at the people nearby, and immediately flipped the tile over.
0:50:0|0:50:12|In the deserted Fugui Market, everyone gathered together, laughing, drinking, and playing games. [Miao's Dad] happily walked in, with his arm around Afeng's shoulder.
0:50:36|0:50:47|[Miao's Dad] stood up from his chair and pointed at him, leaving everyone around stunned. Soon after, a [Chicken Guy] and a [Fish Guy] were placed on the dining table.
0:50:50|0:50:58|[Miao's Dad] pointed, [Fish Guy] turned his head and said. Looking at the furious [Miao's Dad], no one dared to say a word. The child on the side said,
0:51:7|0:51:16|[Fish Guy] kept his head down and didn't say anything, while [Miao's Dad] furrowed his brow and said,
0:51:29|0:51:35|In his memory, he picked up the ornament symbolizing [Fish Guy] and threw it into the trash can.
0:52:2|0:52:12|[Miao's Dad] loudly scolded [Fish Guy], the surroundings fell silent. [Fish Guy], looking at the stern expression of [Miao's Dad], closed his mouth. At this moment, nosebleed started flowing again, [Miao's Dad] raised his hand and wiped it off.
0:52:31|0:52:35|Wiping the nosebleed with one hand, he walked into the fruit guy's stall.
0:52:39|0:52:50|The oranges rolled all over the floor, and the Fruit Guy impatiently shouted towards the stall, but there was no response from the other side. [Fish Guy] shouted again, but still no movement from the opposite stall. Everyone's attention was focused on the fruit stall.
0:52:50|0:52:56|Without getting a response, he immediately put down the chopsticks in his hand and ran over, with everyone following suit. [Fish Guy] picked up [Miao's Dad] lying on the ground.
0:53:4|0:53:21|Miao's Dad, with a nosebleed, weakly calls out Qimiao's name. At this moment, Qimiao, who went out to buy beer, rushes out of the store. She runs straight across the road, causing the car behind her to honk and immediately hit the brakes. Then she quickly runs into Fuguixu, turns a corner, and sees her dad lying on the ground.
0:53:32|0:53:38|The next morning, a loud doorbell rang,
0:53:41|0:53:50|[Fish Guy] opens the door, and [Miao's Dad] walks in immediately. [Miao's Dad] shakes off [Fish Guy]'s hand and strides confidently in front of [Zhou Qimiao], saying,
0:53:50|0:54:8|[Tuo Shu] took out the bill and looked at it. [Zhou Qimiao] took the bill with a puzzled look. [Tuo Shu] looked at the pitiful [Zhou Qimiao] and wiped her nose. Then he patted [Zhou Qimiao]'s shoulder and said,
0:54:14|0:54:28|[Fish Guy] opened the door, [Miao's Dad] glanced at him and walked out. [Zhou Qimiao] sat on the sofa, looking down at the bill in her hand. [Fish Guy] looked back and then followed [Miao's Dad] out. [Zhou Qimiao] sighed deeply as she looked at the debt that had already been paid off. At this moment, [Fish Guy] coming down the stairs said,
0:54:37|0:54:39|Uncle Tuo answered while walking downstairs.
0:54:39|0:54:59|In the room at this moment, [Zhou Qimiao] sat on the sofa, holding a compartmentalized safe box belonging to the father and daughter. She used the key to open the compartment belonging to [Miao's Dad], took out some trivial items, and then pulled out an old, faded photo. It was a childhood photo of herself and [Dad], she looked at it for a while before setting it aside. Then [Zhou Qimiao] took out a thick stack of money tied with a rubber band from inside.
0:54:59|0:55:18|Pressing the play button on the old radio next to him, Zhou Qimiao recalled the day when Miao's Dad lay on the ground with his mouth wide open, trying his best to say something.
0:55:21|0:55:41|Qimiao listened to the nursery rhyme, tears welling up in her eyes. She looked at the portrait of her dad on the table, feeling a sharp pain in her heart. Over the years, the father and daughter had experienced bitterness and tears in the days of repaying debts, but the memories were still hard to forget.
0:55:41|0:55:51|With her only relative gone, [Zhou Qimiao] felt like a small boat lost at sea. She picked up her notebook filled with plans and flipped through every entry she had recorded.
0:55:51|0:56:2|Upon hearing the words "leave the market before turning 30," [Zhou Qimiao] couldn't help but smile bitterly. She then tore off the pages filled with plans, threw them into the fire pit along with her notebook, and the flames kept burning.
0:56:2|0:56:8|Burn everything from the past into ashes. That night, [Fish Guy] accompanied [Zhou Qimiao] to play a game of bowling on the rooftop.
0:56:16|0:56:21|[Fish Guy] staggered over, picked up the watermelon next to him, and turned to look straight ahead.
0:56:39|0:56:45|[Fish Guy] picks up the fallen white radish while talking.
0:56:50|0:56:56|[Zhou Qimiao] smashed a big watermelon on [Fish Guy]'s waist. [Fish Guy] lay on the ground groaning as [Zhou Qimiao] walked over, bending at the waist.
0:57:15|0:57:35|[Fish Guy] placed [Zhou Qimiao] on the side of the roof, then dragged his heavy body towards the table full of beer. He picked up a bottle opener, but when he heard [Zhou Qimiao]'s crying, [Fish Guy] stopped his action and turned around. At this moment, [Zhou Qimiao] was sitting on the ground, crying with her head down. She knew that no matter how much alcohol she drank, it would be difficult to numb the pain of losing her loved one.
0:57:35|0:58:2|Fish Guy then slowly approached Zhou Qimiao, looking at the tearful girl with heartache. Faced with such vulnerability, he didn't know how to comfort her for a moment. He sighed, slowly reached out his hands to hold her arms. Zhou Qimiao kept crying and pushing away his arms. Fish Guy angrily shouted. At this moment, Zhou Qimiao was completely unable to control the sadness in her heart, crying uncontrollably with tears soaking her hair on both sides.
0:58:2|0:58:15|[Fish Guy] looked at [Zhou Qimiao], regretting his impulsive actions earlier. He then raised his arms again and embraced [Zhou Qimiao], who this time did not resist. She leaned against [Fish Guy]'s shoulder and poured out her sadness freely in this warm embrace.
0:58:15|0:58:20|At night, the quiet sky echoed with the cries of [Zhou Qimiao], as [Fish Guy] held her, sharing her inner pain.
0:58:20|0:58:40|The next morning, the piercing sunlight shone through the cracks of the blinds. [Fish Guy] lay on the bed with his mouth half open, sound asleep. He still wore the bracelet that [Biscuit Guy] had given to [Zhou Qimiao] on his wrist. Then [Fish Guy] turned over and fell back into a deep slumber. Suddenly, a hand reached out from the other side of the bed and pulled the blanket, revealing [Zhou Qimiao] struggling to sit up, rubbing her still groggy head.
0:58:40|0:59:4|Qimiao sat on the bed and moved her sore neck a bit. She turned to look at Fish Guy, who was sleeping next to her, pursing his lips and revealing a childlike innocent smile. As she gazed at Fish Guy's face, Qimiao's expression turned extremely indifferent. Fish Guy always appeared when she needed company, but she was unsure about their future life. After staring for a long time, she was attracted by the bracelet on Fish Guy's wrist. It turned out that he had never lost it, but instead wore it on himself.
0:59:4|0:59:15|Following that, Zhou Qimiao got out of bed and went to the bathroom, closing the door behind her. She walked wearily to the sink, casually running her hand through her messy hair a few times before tying it up. Looking at her reflection in the mirror, Zhou Qimiao fell into deep thought.
0:59:26|0:59:40|In the mirror, Zhou Qimiao's face gradually became fierce, her eyes filled with pride and defiance, strengthening her disdain for the market and firming her resolve. The scene shifts to Fuguixu.
0:59:42|0:59:51|At this moment, the stall owners in Fugui Market were getting ready to open for business. [Fish Guy] walked in with breakfast, smiling, but when he didn't see Qimiao around, he checked the time on his watch.
1:0:8|1:0:15|[Fish Guy] immediately arrived downstairs at Qimiao's house, he took out his phone and answered a call while walking.
1:0:17|1:0:40|[Fish Guy] knocked on the door but no one answered. He noticed that the security door was slightly ajar. He then pulled it open and found a note stuck on the door lock core that read "Landlady's key is on top of the iron gate." After seeing Miao's message, [Fish Guy] immediately took the key from the top of the iron gate, opened the door, and looked into the empty room. He stood there in shock.
1:0:40|1:1:0|He slowly moved his feet into the room, [Fish Guy] glanced at the kitchen unwillingly, then walked into Qimiao's bedroom. The empty house told him the undeniable truth. Qimiao's sudden disappearance hit [Fish Guy] hard. He turned around and looked at the lonely furniture, then immediately took out his phone to make a call.
1:1:0|1:1:22|The machine voice announcing the suspension of service echoed in his ears again, [Fish Guy] realized that Qimiao had indeed left. He slowly put down his phone, stood still in place for a long time, looking at the hazy sky outside the window. Then he took a few steps forward towards the window, and the distant street became clearer, but he did not see that familiar figure.
1:1:22|1:1:34|[Fish Guy] stood alone in front of the window, his back lonely and desolate. At this moment, Qimiao appeared with her eyes closed in the frame.
1:1:47|1:2:17|Makeup artist casually tugs at the skin of [Zhou Qimiao], who is expressionless as a makeup model. [Fish Guy] refuses to answer, lowering his head to clean the road with a water gun. His partner sees that he is not speaking and walks out carrying something, but [Fish Guy] still has no mood to respond. He focuses on cleaning the ground of the Fortune Market with the water gun. At this moment, [Fish Guy] can only use temporary busyness to escape his bad mood, and can only use the cleaning time to reminisce about the days spent with [Zhou Qimiao].
1:2:17|1:2:28|The once bustling Fugui Market is now deserted, with [Fish Guy] standing in place looking up at the adjacent shops. He then shuts off the water gun and places it weakly by his leg. On the other side, Zhou Qimiao's makeup artist turns around and says,
1:2:33|1:2:42|[Zhou Qimiao] sat in the front with a delicate makeup on her face, smiling and trying her best to show her best side.
1:2:42|1:3:11|At this moment, the cleaned up [Fish Guy] came to the clothes rack, took out his phone from the pocket of the hanging cotton jacket, dialed the familiar number again. He hesitated as he looked at the phone, then raised his hand to his ear. The mechanical female voice on the phone remained unchanged. [Fish Guy] closed his eyes in pain and leaned against the wall. At this moment, he was troubled and filled with anxiety and helplessness. The beep sound on the phone kept ringing, but [Fish Guy] refused to put down the phone from his ear.
1:3:11|1:3:16|The feeling of going from anticipation to disappointment made him feel unbearable pain.
1:3:17|1:3:24|He took a deep breath while holding his phone, and said again, after that [Fish Guy] pursed his lips tightly to control his emotions.
1:3:24|1:3:40|Shortly after, she slowly opened her eyes. At that moment, the makeup artist was applying makeup to the beautiful actress who was getting ready for work. [Zhou Qimiao] was on the side, assisting and learning. She handed over a brush, and the actress looked at the clumsy [Zhou Qimiao] with a displeased expression on her face.
1:4:0|1:4:12|Amidst the sound of firecrackers, [Zhou Qimiao] joyfully celebrates the New Year with the makeup team, while fireworks on TV burst into different shapes. Meanwhile, [Fish Guy] is all alone on the rooftop of Fuguixu, lying on the ping pong table placed above.
1:4:12|1:4:26|He rolled a ping pong ball on his stomach, staring straight at the dark sky, not knowing if [Zhou Qimiao] would show up, or if this wait would end in disappointment once again. The next morning, the entrance of Fugui Market was crowded with people.
1:4:33|1:4:41|Pork Guy rushed over upon learning about Fish Guy's situation.
1:4:51|1:5:6|In the Riches Market, [Fish Guy] is surrounded by several police officers, and [Pork Guy] walks in. The [Fish Guy] on the other side seems not to have heard, holding a knife to cut fish.
1:5:23|1:5:32|Fish Guy still didn't answer, nonchalantly picking up another fish. The officer looked at the abundance of fish on Fish Guy's stall, looking shocked.
1:5:40|1:5:49|At this moment, [Fish Guy] tightly held a kitchen knife in his hand. A police officer took the knife from him, while the other two officers immediately grabbed [Fish Guy]'s arms and dragged him out.
1:6:1|1:6:23|[Fish Guy] was carried into the police car by several officers. The stall owners at the Fu Gui Market rushed over to inquire about his condition. With the sound of seagulls in the background, the scene shifted to a tranquil fishing ground. In the distance, scattered buildings could be seen on the sea, and a person standing on a boat, pulling up a fishing net with both hands.
1:6:23|1:6:43|In the fishing net, there were a bunch of lively fish jumping around. The camera gradually moved up, revealing the face of [Fish Guy] in the frame. He was wearing water shoes and an apron, exerting all his strength to pull up the fishing net. Walking to the water bucket on the shore, he picked up a fish basket and poured the fish from the net into the bucket. Looking at the large and plump fresh fish in front of him, [Fish Guy] showed a satisfied smile. Then he revved up his fishing boat and sped away.
1:6:43|1:7:1|The sunlight shines on him, and the lake surface glistens. At this moment, a group of actors in performance costumes appear in the scene. They are rehearsing a dance in front of a mirror. The actress sitting in front of the makeup mirror looks satisfied with her makeup. Sitting next to her is the skilled makeup artist [Zhou Qimiao]. Suddenly, the director walks over and says.
1:7:24|1:7:29|Fish Guy's name appears on the computer desktop, and his granddaughter opens an email.
1:7:47|1:7:55|At this moment, [Zhou Qimiao] walked into a restaurant.
1:9:8|1:9:17|After saying that, he grinned and looked at [Zhou Qimiao]. The scene shifted, with [Fish Guy] carefully holding a plate with one hand and ladling porridge with a spoon with the other hand.
1:9:30|1:9:37|[Chicken Guy] and [Cai Po] are smiling as they read the email reply from [Fish Guy].
1:9:54|1:10:2|[Pork Guy] picked up the mirror on the table and said.
1:10:12|1:10:24|After saying that, he pursed his lips. The assistant walked over and said, [Pork Guy] responded with a sound, then turned to look at [Zhou Qimiao], and got up to walk towards the filming location. [Zhou Qimiao] sat in her original seat, lost in thought.
1:10:36|1:10:47|[Pork Guy] recites a passionate and stirring advertisement in front of a luxury car. Several months later, [Zhou Qimiao] drives a new car onto the street while wearing a mask. As she reaches an intersection, she stops the car and waits for the traffic light.
1:10:47|1:11:9|As she watched the passing pedestrians, a familiar figure caught her eye. [Zhou Qimiao] couldn't believe her eyes as she stood up from her seat to get a closer look at the man wearing a mask. Her eyes widened as the masked [Fish Guy] hurriedly crossed the street. Her gaze followed this familiar figure closely, her hands gripping the steering wheel tightly, feeling nervous. As she saw [Fish Guy] about to walk away, she pressed the horn hard.
1:11:13|1:11:25|[Zhou Qimiao] anxiously lowered the car window and stuck her head out to watch [Fish Guy] walking away. Just then, the green light came on, and the cars behind started honking incessantly. [Fish Guy] crossed the street and got into a taxi on the other side, [Zhou Qimiao] watched him leave before finally starting the car.
1:11:25|1:11:38|After the car passed the intersection, [Zhou Qimiao] was still looking back in the direction where [Fish Guy] had left. Then she took out her phone while holding the steering wheel. [Zhou Qimiao] glanced at the phone and pressed the quick search button, all while keeping an eye on the road ahead. Suddenly, a woman with a backpack walked out.
1:11:38|1:11:48|The woman was scared and fell to the ground. [Zhou Qimiao] immediately unbuckled her seatbelt and got out of the car to check. She ran over and asked, the woman's legs were covered in bruises, [Zhou Qimiao] said worriedly.
1:12:12|1:12:20|Fish Guy stared at him with wide eyes after hearing that, at this moment, Ah Miao's car appeared at the door of the shop, with the woman who had almost been hit sitting in the passenger seat.
1:12:21|1:12:27|The car slowly came to a stop, and the woman said to [Zhou Qimiao].
1:12:30|1:12:42|[Zhou Qimiao] watched as she closed the car door, then started the car. Hearing the sound of the engine starting, [Fish Guy] turned around and saw [Zhou Qimiao] wearing a mask. He stared with wide eyes in the direction the car drove off, then furrowed his brow, thought for a moment, and turned away.
1:14:8|1:14:30|At this moment, a bus with a broken windshield is parked diagonally by the roadside. A man is complaining as he gets out of the bus, followed by a woman carrying a crying child. Other passengers also start to disembark. A white car next to the bus has collided with its rear wheel. Inside the car, still in shock, is [Zhou Qimiao]. A police officer approaches the car window and asks.
1:14:49|1:15:3|[Zhou Qimiao] sat on the roadside listening to the sounds of people talking around her. She picked up her phone and looked at it, only to find that she had no one to confide in. She slowly put down the phone with one hand supporting her face, then looked into the distance with a lonely expression on her face. [Zhou Qimiao] picked up her phone and opened her email.
1:15:5|1:15:8|On the screen, it reads: "I am [Fish Guy], who are you?"
1:15:8|1:15:26|The short message made [Zhou Qimiao] panic for a moment. Her hand holding the phone trembled slightly. At her most helpless moment, this brief greeting felt like a warm stream flowing into her heart. She hesitated as she looked up, but after a while of inner struggle, she suddenly smiled as if she had made up her mind. Several hours later, a taxi swiftly shuttled through the middle of the road.
1:15:26|1:15:38|Ahead is the scene of the accident, where the police have placed barriers in the center to warn passing vehicles. [Fish Guy] sits in the back seat of a taxi, looking worried as he watches the scene of the car crash. He unbuckles his seatbelt and moves to the other side of the seat, looking through the glass to find [Zhou Qimiao]'s figure.
1:15:38|1:15:43|The driver immediately opened the car door and got out after parking, then he asked the traffic policeman standing nearby.
1:15:56|1:16:14|[Fish Guy] was reproaching Zhou Qimiao with a hint of blame, his eyes filled with worry. Zhou Qimiao looked at him without saying a word, her eyes slightly red with tears. [Fish Guy] could see all her emotions and care for her in his eyes. Seeing Zhou Qimiao's teary eyes, [Fish Guy]'s impatient expression gradually softened. Uncomfortably, he averted his gaze and lowered his head, while Zhou Qimiao also turned her head away and stopped looking at him.
1:16:14|1:16:21|[Fish Guy] suddenly stood up and walked towards the damaged car. He opened the door and started searching around in the driver's seat.
1:16:21|1:16:37|Shortly after, he got off the car and looked into the back seat. He bent down to peer into the car, then quickly walked a few steps towards the front of the car. He then crouched down on the ground to pick up the shoes that had fallen, and struggled to stand up before walking over with the shoes in hand.
1:16:55|1:17:6|Qimiao looked at the blueprint in silence. The scene then shifted to the abandoned Fu Gui Market, where a pair of pliers was clamping on a chain on the door. The person violently opening the door was [Fish Guy].
1:17:15|1:17:20|The dirty floor is littered with the position chart from the once prosperous Riches Market. Zhou Qimiao picks it up and laughs.
1:17:23|1:17:33|[Fish Guy] walked behind Qimiao, looking at the peeling job description and the confident expression on Qimiao's face. He asked incredulously.
1:18:23|1:18:36|Once again, Zhou Qimiao effortlessly lifted the fish crate, showing off her skills. Beside her, [Fish Guy] couldn't help but smile at the scene. The familiar feeling brought joy to both of them, as they then pushed the cart filled with fish boxes together, contentedly walking away.
1:18:56|1:19:5|As usual, everyone placed the fruits on the stall, while the child stood beside not knowing what to do. Under the influence of the irritable mother, the child sat on the bench seemingly understanding but not really.
1:19:5|1:19:21|Finally, she took out a pen from her backpack and started doing her homework. The vendor next to her bent over, holding a water kettle and sprinkling water on the ground. [Fish Guy], wearing an apron, placed the bucket of fish porridge against the wall. Miao smiled as she looked at the porridge pot that had accompanied her throughout her youth. The days in the Fortune Market were the hardest and most unforgettable days for her.
1:19:21|1:19:27|Thanks to Chicken Guy, Zhou Qimiao also benefited and was able to return to this place full of friendship.
1:19:27|1:19:43|Fish Guy then walked into the stall, while Zhou Qimiao craned her neck to look inside. She saw Fish Guy gritting his teeth, carrying a full box of fresh live fish. He smiled as he slowly put down the fish box and then placed the oxygen tube into the water. Next, Fish Guy stood up straight and took down the calendar from the wall.
1:19:46|1:19:57|[Zhou Qimiao] smiled at [Fish Guy], then shook her head. They then stood on either side of a wall, facing a mirror, and started fixing their hair. [Fish Guy]'s hair was covered in plastic curlers, making him look like a landlady.
1:19:57|1:20:15|[Zhou Qimiao] is on the other side of the wall, picking up a wig with his bare hands. A few minutes later, [Fish Guy] pulls off the curling iron, looking at his younger self in the mirror, he smiles with satisfaction. At this moment, [Zhou Qimiao] is also ready, looking at the familiar explosion head of [Fish Guy], [Zhou Qimiao] covers her mouth and laughs. At this time, the lights in the Fu Gui Market light up one by one.
1:20:15|1:20:21|Everyone gathered together preparing for the upcoming task, as [Miao's Dad] walked in with a smile on his face.
1:20:44|1:20:58|[Feng] gasped as she reported the news to everyone, at this moment [Cai Po] helped [Biscuit Guy] walk in, everyone lowered their heads not knowing how to explain.
1:21:3|1:21:15|Everyone looked at the woman in confusion. [Cai Po] pushed aside [Chicken Guy] who was blocking the road, muttering under her breath. At this moment, everyone stood still in shock.
1:21:17|1:21:22|Everyone returned to their stalls, and at this moment, the bustling atmosphere of Fugui Market was restored.
1:22:3|1:22:10|Qimiao looked in the direction she pointed, only to see Fish Guy smiling and pointing at Chicken Guy in front of him.
1:23:10|1:23:32|At this moment, the outside was surrounded by reporters. Officer Ah Xiong walked out first, followed by the stall owners from Fu Gui Market who stood hand in hand in front of the door. Then Officer Ah Xiong turned around and looked at [Chicken Guy]. Upon hearing Chicken Guy calling him, Officer Ah Xiong walked over. At that moment, Chicken Guy solemnly took a camera out of his pocket and handed it to him.
1:23:47|1:24:5|Everyone lowered their heads to look at the camera below. At this moment, Pork Guy raised his hand in a salute, with Fish Guy and Qimiao following suit. The people around them also began to imitate, for these stall owners, Fortune Market was not just a market, but a generation's experience and changes. The well-intentioned lie also fulfilled Chicken Guy's dream.
1:24:5|1:24:10|In this scene, a blueprint of the Fish Porridge King appears, with [Fish Guy] sitting in front of the mirror.
1:24:51|1:25:10|Miao smiled apologetically and then walked over to the sofa, sitting down. She picked up her crossbody bag next to her and took out the wallet that Fish Guy had given her earlier. At that moment, Fish Guy's phone suddenly rang. Miao looked at Fish Guy in confusion as he took out his phone. Fish Guy stood up and said in an indulgent tone.
1:25:13|1:25:18|Miao stood up and looked at [Fish Guy], unable to believe her ears, standing there dumbfounded.
1:25:30|1:25:43|Seeing Qimiao's strong reaction, [Fish Guy] reached behind her and grabbed one side of the wallet. The familiar touch made him stop his action and his face turned awkward. At this moment, Qimiao stared ahead expressionless, making [Fish Guy] feel her unusualness, so he dared not speak again.
1:25:43|1:25:47|Standing still, Zhou Qimiao's eyes were dull and lifeless. She slowly turned her head to look at [Fish Guy] and said,
1:25:51|1:26:1|Miao looked at Fish Guy in front of her with no emotions. Miao's expression said it all. Fish Guy looked at her steadily, his eyes inexplicably moist. Fish Guy stood up and said,
1:26:13|1:26:27|Qimiao sighed softly as she turned to look at the back of [Fish Guy]. Then she gently placed the wallet she was carrying behind her down, her hands still caressing its surface. Next, a square camera appeared in the scene, with [Fish Guy] wearing clown makeup and a chef's hat.
1:26:29|1:26:36|[Fish Guy] squeezed out a smile with great effort, freezing time in this moment.
1:26:50|1:27:1|Zhou Qimiao's eyes followed his figure all the time, then he turned around and waved to Zhou Qimiao with a smile. The woman also smiled and nodded at Zhou Qimiao.
1:27:10|1:27:22|Amiao looked at the happy smile of [Fish Guy] and the harmonious back view of their family of three, with a look of envy in her eyes. Seeing how content [Fish Guy] is now, Amiao also felt relieved. She smiled and turned back to her own makeup shop.
1:27:23|1:27:30|The scene shifts to Fugui Market, where several construction workers wearing helmets are working at the entrance. At this moment, a car slowly pulls over to the side of the road, and sitting in the car is [Zhou Qimiao].
1:27:44|1:27:58|Qimiao's gaze lingered for a moment, then she started the car and left gracefully. The construction workers next to her were still busy, time passed, and the past events eventually became history. On this day,
