0:0:59|0:1:17|At this moment, two people suddenly appeared with the improved sabers of General Qi, wanting to have a martial arts competition with the four major sects in order to establish a reputation for the saber technique created by General Qi and continue its legacy. However, the four major sects accused them of being Japanese pirates due to their weapons resembling sabers, and began to pursue them.
0:1:17|0:1:35|The film opens with the distant spring scenery of Shuangye City, where the lotus leaves in the pond are withering, and a drizzle is floating around. Outside the city, a young man with a long stick swiftly takes down the incoming enemies with a few moves. The enemies fall flat on the damp and cold wasteland.
0:1:35|0:1:41|Qiu Dongyue's companion, seeing the crisis resolved, calmly got up from the pile of firewood and left the scene with him.
0:1:41|0:1:56|Several sharp eagle cries pierced the sky. A bearded old man, carrying two guns on his back, stood beside a thatched cottage in the wilderness. He couldn't help but sigh towards the sky. This man is the top master of Shuangye City, [Qiu Dongyue].
0:1:56|0:2:10|His contemplation was interrupted by a ladle of water handed to him, the one handing it was the hunter's daughter, [Liang Henlu]. The gentle breeze tousled his embroidered hair by his feet, messily falling on his face. After a brief exchange of glances with [Qiu Dongyue], he then calmly walked into the house.
0:2:15|0:2:19|Madam Qiu glanced ahead after hearing, and replied leisurely.
0:2:21|0:2:38|The hunter remained silent, as [Qiu Dongyue] lowered her head and drank the water from the gourd in big gulps. After a moment, she slung her bag and twin guns over her shoulders and continued on into the deep mountains. The secluded mountain path was quiet, with all things in stillness. The eagle high above occasionally screeched, but [Qiu Dongyue] did not look back, advancing alone towards the deep mountains.
0:2:38|0:2:55|At this moment, in Shuangye City, a peaceful atmosphere prevailed. Within the Wuyixiang where the four major sects resided, an old man was sweeping the fallen leaves on the ground. Suddenly, two young men walked towards [Qiu Dongyue]. Subsequently, several servants with knives emerged from the door, causing [Qiu Dongyue] to drop the broom in his hand and flee the scene.
0:2:55|0:3:1|At the same moment, two young men drew their long swords and easily took care of the first group of servants at the door with just two strikes each.
0:3:2|0:3:20|Two figures, their heads covered with hoods, moved cautiously and low under severe pressure. Several servants didn't even have a chance to see their faces before falling to the ground. These two mysterious individuals were [Liang Henlu], former personal guard of General Qi, and the Left Adjutant of the Seven Armies. After easily passing through the first gate, they continued walking deeper into the alley.
0:3:22|0:3:33|In the fight, Qiu Dongyue's right shoulder was accidentally hit by Liang Henlu's long spear, causing blood to flow continuously. Yang Henglu found it difficult to push back Qiu Dongyue, who was already leaning against the wall and unable to wield the knife.
0:3:39|0:3:55|Upon hearing the slogan shouted out by the left side, [Liang Henlu] raised his long knife and continued to stride forward. He was neither arrogant nor impatient, advancing steadily. As he approached the third doorway, two servants with knives were already in position, neatly tying up the trailing hem of his robe at the waist.
0:3:56|0:4:13|With his right hand holding a long-handled broadsword, [Liang Henlu] stood still waiting for [Qiu Dongyue] to approach. [Liang Henlu] then switched the knife from his right hand to his left hand, and as the two servants saw this, they momentarily let down their guard. When [Liang Henlu] walked up to the two of them, after a moment of silence, he suddenly drew his sword.
0:4:15|0:4:34|Two servants quickly blocked the long knife of [Liang Henlu], but in the next second, [Liang Henlu] kicked one person's ankle, swiftly circled behind him, knocked him out, leaving only one servant facing off against [Liang Henlu]. However, the two of them were evenly matched in their weapon skills, neither able to get close. After several attempts, the servant finally put away his long knife.
0:4:34|0:4:43|Silently lowering her head, [Qiu Dongyue] gestured for [Liang Henlu] to continue the challenge. In this way, [Liang Henlu] successfully passed through the first three doors. However, there was no one in front of the fourth door.
0:4:44|0:4:56|[Liang Henlu] stepped slowly to the front of the door, turned around to face inside, but who would have thought that, at this moment, the person inside the door unexpectedly didn't follow the usual moves and shot a cold arrow.
0:4:56|0:5:13|[Liang Henlu] immediately dodged to the side, his body's center of gravity shifting in an instant, preventing him from falling to his knees. The long sword pierced through his hat, and seeing dozens of people inside the gate pulling bows and arrows, [Liang Henlu] didn't hesitate. He quickly got up and ran backwards, with the leading mistress and a dozen archers walking out of the gate.
0:5:14|0:5:34|Qiu Dongyue pressed on step by step towards [Liang Henlu], constantly on guard against the archers in front of him. He also tried to take away the heavily injured Zuo Pian Shi who had fallen to the ground, but the archers were numerous and eager to surround him as soon as [Liang Henlu] made a move. Helpless, [Liang Henlu] could only retreat once again towards the second gate.
0:5:34|0:5:40|Returning to the beginning of the alley, he pointed the long knife at the archer, bent his legs, half-squatting in a horse stance, with a determined gaze.
0:6:15|0:6:33|[Liang Henlu] heard these words, tidied up and put down the long sword. As the tip of the long sword touched the ground, [Liang Henlu] quickly picked up the wooden scabbard on the ground and swiftly fled without a trace. The leaders of the other three major sects walked over.
0:6:38|0:7:0|Another sect leader held a long sword with the left side facing up, while passing it to [Madam Qiu]. [Madam Qiu] grasped the handle of the sword, took two steps forward, and carefully examined the blade against her arm. She then tapped her arm a few times with the blade, producing a deep and heavy sound.
0:7:0|0:7:5|On the left, Qiu Dongyue was guarded by two servants, who quietly averted their gaze upon witnessing the scene.
0:7:9|0:7:29|Night falls, several officials carrying dim lanterns patrol the streets. A double-decker colorful boat floats on the Qinhuai River all year round, with lights shining inside. A beautiful and charming dancer with thick long hair, dressed in exotic Bohemian-style clothing, her face beaming with a smile, energetically swaying her waist.
0:7:29|0:7:36|Accompanied by a drum played with one hand, the movements are delicate and soft, the dance is graceful and light, expressing different postures with classical variations.
0:8:28|0:8:33|The bohemian exotic woman [Sailan] had to beat the drum again and sway her waist.
0:8:42|0:8:55|The three sisters left the colorful boat laughing, with [Madam Qiu] reluctantly continuing to dance with a gloomy expression. The contrast between her graceful dance moves and the melancholy on her face became more pronounced. Growing angrier by the moment, she eventually threw the hand drum to the ground.
0:9:20|0:9:41|When you speak of common sense. [Liang Henlu] looked fierce, sending shivers down the spine. In the moment when [Sailan] locked eyes with [Liang Henlu], her whole body stiffened. After a moment, she took a sharp breath, dared not say another word, slowly retreated to her original position, and twisted her waist once again.
0:9:42|0:9:56|In the alley of Wuyi, a crowd of people squeezed in. [Madam Qiu] sat on a high chair, with a melancholy and bewildered expression, eyes downcast, watching a group of mediocre people competing in martial arts. Beside her, the guard Gan Gang stood, holding a long battle-axe to protect the battle.
0:9:56|0:10:11|The sound of two warriors' weapons clashing constantly, as well as the shouts when they exert force with their fists and feet, filled the originally quiet alley. Three foreign women mingled among the common people, watching this martial arts competition with great interest. The two warriors were testing each other, and then closing in on each other.
0:10:38|0:11:1|Upon hearing a group of women's words, [Madam Qiu] couldn't help but retort a few words back. A smile that couldn't be contained immediately appeared on her face. The leaders of the three major sects were present at the martial arts competition, while the mistress was in the prison cell, carefully examining the left-handed long knife in her hand.
0:11:1|0:11:7|The beastly Qiu Dongyue couldn't help but grunt as she squatted for a long time, causing her legs to tremble uncontrollably.
0:11:14|0:11:19|Jie Lao's face was full of mockery as he watched Qiu Dongyue being tortured and howling in agony.
0:11:29|0:11:47|Left Attendant couldn't bear it and eventually fainted. When Qie Lao saw this, he kicked the scabbard of the long knife away and swung the knife towards Left Attendant. The fainted Left Attendant woke up instantly upon hearing the sound, and saw the knife firmly stuck in the beam above his head. Qie Lao then continued speaking.
0:13:0|0:13:17|Madam Qiu heard this and got up, walking into the left wing room. The servants beside her quickly brought a chair and followed her closely. When Madam Qiu stood beside the left wing room, the chair was placed behind her, and she sat down. After sitting down, she pondered for a moment and then spoke.
0:14:27|0:14:38|Mr. Xie stood up from his seat without looking at Qiu Dongyue. After taking two steps, he casually threw the scabbard in his hand on the ground.
0:14:47|0:15:1|Upon hearing this, Qiu Dongyue turned to look to the left, and after speaking, she left the prison cell.
0:15:6|0:15:24|As he walked out of the gate and arrived at the entrance, without looking inside, the samurai's martial arts competition was still ongoing. He calmly watched from the side, until a move by one of the samurais caught his eye. Fortunately, Master Lu acted swiftly and saved his beloved disciple from the hands of another samurai just in time.
0:15:24|0:15:26|At the same time, there was a commotion behind the crowd.
0:15:31|0:15:37|Mr. Lu saw several soldiers approaching, and with a command, he ordered the warriors in the martial arts competition to stop fighting.
0:15:45|0:15:52|Approaching, [Qiu Dongyue] grabbed Liu Kai's arm and said a few words to him. When Liu Kai turned around again, most of his anger had dissipated.
0:15:56|0:16:0|Madam Qiu, Wang Lao, and Lu Lang stepped forward to pat Liu Kai's armor.
0:16:51|0:16:55|[Liu Kai] turned around to leave, but saw the person sitting high above.
0:17:3|0:17:16|[Liu Kai]'s loud greetings made [Qiu Dongyue] very happy, with a smile on her face as she comfortably leaned back in her chair. The three sisters in the family admired [Liang Henlu]'s heroic demeanor, their faces full of worship, their eyes always following [Liang Henlu].
0:17:16|0:17:26|After Liang Henlu walked away, Madam Qiu turned sideways and glanced at Madam Qiu sitting on the high seat. Feeling the sharp gaze from Madam Qiu, Madam Qiu showed no fear and stared back at her with wide eyes.
0:17:44|0:17:51|After Madam Qiu finished speaking, she turned and walked to the chair in front of the door. Mr. Cai, Mr. Wang, and Mr. Lu followed closely and took their seats one after another.
0:18:19|0:18:29|Upon hearing Qie Lao's insistence, the leaders of the three major sects had no choice but to comply with his wishes. At this moment, the exotic woman [Saran] on the boat continued to dance incessantly.
0:18:41|0:19:2|Lying on the bed, [Liang Henlu] reached out with one hand and the long knife flashed for a moment. A half of the ring on [Madam Qiu]'s hand bone was left, and she looked angrily at her hand bone. After speaking, [Madam Qiu] couldn't hold back anymore, she covered her face with her hand and cried in grievance, [Liang Henlu] stood up and looked at her.
0:19:5|0:19:16|[Sailan], despite being full of grievances, still followed [Liang Henlu]'s words and sat down next to him.
0:19:42|0:19:59|[Sailan] placed her hands on [Liang Henlu]'s shoulders. Liang Henlu embraced [Sailan] tightly, and she responded by gently holding his neck with both hands. The composed Liang Henlu then noticed some movement outside the bed. [Sailan] was puzzled upon hearing this.
0:20:7|0:20:22|Liang Henlu handed the wine pot to him, [Madam Qiu] was angry and wanted to slap him. But she still feared his gaze, so she took the wine pot and walked towards the bed. Before [Madam Qiu] opened the curtain, Liang Henlu quickly tidied up the knife, turned over and hid under the bed.
0:20:22|0:20:34|Sailan, who pulled back the curtain, was shocked by the scene in front of her. The shore in front of the boat was filled with people from the four major sects. Sailan looked closely and saw some servants with torches stuck on wooden stakes on the shore, holding long-handled axes on the side.
0:20:34|0:20:39|Beside her sat [Madam Qiu] in a high position, while the three sisters sat on the stone steps by the riverbank.
0:20:48|0:20:57|Before [Sailan] could react, he was grabbed by Liang Henlu on the boat. Sailan intended to pretend to faint on the ground, but was seen through by [Liang Henlu] at a glance.
0:20:59|0:21:3|Sailan had no choice but to open her eyes and look at [Liang Henlu].
0:21:8|0:21:22|Sailan lay on the ground, silently looking at the man in front of her. [Liang Henlu] nodded at him, and Sailan smiled happily. With Sailan's consent, [Liang Henlu] drew the long knife from its sheath, placed the sheath on the ground, and used it as a long stick.
0:21:22|0:21:36|Then approaching Sairan, placing the long stick on his knee, and placing one of his hands on the stick. Sairan, seeing this, placed his other hand on top, gripping the stick with both hands. [Liang Henlu] also grabbed the stick, his eyes sharp and cold.
0:21:37|0:21:48|Extend the stick out of the door, close your eyes, and wait for the enemy's weapon to strike. As soon as you hear the sound of the stick,
0:21:52|0:21:58|Sailan diligently studied the methods taught by [Qiu Dongyue], closing her eyes happily.
0:22:5|0:22:17|Madam Qiu, in a high position, remained unmoved upon hearing this, leaning back in her chair and calmly responded. Qiu Dongyue did not expect Madam Qiu to say that. Her eyes immediately turned fierce.
0:22:23|0:22:30|Concubine Lao turned around and looked at the guard Gang Gang beside [Madam Qiu]. Gang Gang remained silent, pursed his lips, and avoided her gaze.
0:22:30|0:22:42|Madam Qiu couldn't sit still anymore. A flying rope jumped off the high chair, making a creaking sound as the wooden chair followed suit. She glared angrily at the old maid, turned around and left. The guards quickly followed, carrying the high chair.
0:22:54|0:23:8|After that, Madam Qiu walked into the room and lay on the grandmaster chair with the other three sect leaders, closing their eyes to rest. The three foreign women were escorted by armed servants to a side room, where two more armed servants followed closely behind.
0:23:8|0:23:22|They walked towards the deck of the merchant ship with big knives in hand, then assumed a tribute posture, slowly kneeling towards the door curtain. The blades made a crisp sound as they touched the sticks, and immediately after, the two of them staggered and collapsed to the ground.
0:23:22|0:23:29|[Sailan] inside the door curtain was very satisfied with the kung fu she had just learned, but when she turned around, she saw [Liang Henlu] opening the window.
0:23:35|0:23:52|After speaking, [Liang Henlu] lifted the knife and flipped over the window, diving into the water. Outside the door curtain, there was a new movement again, [Madam Qiu] holding a hollow long stick, waiting for the approaching servants step by step. The servants slowly approached the door curtain, but as soon as they touched the protruding end of the stick, they were repeatedly blocked.
0:23:55|0:24:10|Madam Qiu walked back in the alley, moonlight shining on the bamboo leaves by the road, casting swaying shadows. She was dressed in plain clothes, with a deeply melancholic expression. Quietly carrying a high chair behind her, she said nothing. Suddenly, Madam Qiu turned to look at her.
0:24:12|0:24:18|Madam Qiu stared at the barbell motionless for a long time before finally saying slowly.
0:24:20|0:24:33|Madam Qiu's eyes gradually dimmed as she turned and continued walking forward, with Liang Henlu closely following behind. The two of them left Qiu Dongyue without saying a word. The cool marks under the water stuck to the hidden shore, observing everything.
0:24:35|0:24:55|On the river bank, [Liang Henlu] strode briskly with four soldiers, forming a "mandarin duck" formation with three shields side by side, each shield with two spears protruding from the gaps. As [Liu Kai] walked onto the bridge, the people in front of him forced him to stop in his tracks.
0:24:55|0:25:0|[Qiu Dongyue] saw [Liang Henlu] leisurely lying on the bridge with one foot raised, and [Madam Qiu] quickly picked up the shield.
0:25:2|0:25:9|While speaking, [Liang Henlu] lazily sat up with his eyes closed and casually replied, hastily drawing his own sword.
0:25:13|0:25:27|[Liu Kai] finally drew the sword behind him and formed a complete Mandarin Duck formation with four other soldiers. Seeing this, [Liang Henlu] finally raised his eyes, picked up his sword, and slowly stood up, slowly approaching the few people under the bridge.
0:25:27|0:25:36|[Liu Kai] and others showed no fear at all, charging towards [Liang Henlu] with determination. The power of the two spears forced [Liang Henlu] to step back a few paces, constantly searching for a gap in the formation.
0:25:37|0:25:45|Liang Henlu prepared to attack the lower body with a long knife, but the three people holding shields were quick and successfully blocked Liang Henlu's sneak attack.
0:25:45|0:25:58|Following that, the spear launched an attack towards him. Liang Henlu saw the situation was not good, turned around and ran off the bridge. The "Mandarin Ducks" formation, however, chased closely behind. The front ends of the two spears were actually tied with explosives, continuously closing in. The shield bearer took the opportunity to launch a close-range attack on Liang Henlu.
0:25:58|0:26:14|After the gunfire at the front of the spear burned out, Liang Henlu was once again attacked by the spear. During the intervals of resisting the spear attacks, he was knocked down by the shield bearer.
0:26:20|0:26:25|Liu Kai saw this scene and put away his sword, taking out a bundle of hemp rope, preparing to capture Liang Henlu.
0:26:27|0:26:41|Liang Henlu stood up and embraced Liu Kai, throwing his sword aside and forcefully suppressing him.
0:26:48|0:27:5|The other four soldiers immediately dropped their shields and spears. Then, Liang Henlu suppressed Liu Kai, with the four soldiers walking in front of them towards the river. When they got close to the shore, the four soldiers lined up on the bottom step, hesitating to take the next step.
0:27:19|0:27:23|Liang Henlu glared at Liu Kai angrily.
0:27:42|0:27:53|Liang Henlu slowly moved the long knife away from his neck and nodded to signal that he should also jump into the water. [Liu Kai] forced a bitter smile on his face and then splashed into the water with a thud.
0:27:53|0:28:5|Following that, Liang Henlu also jumped into the water. When Liu Kai and the others turned around underwater, they couldn't see Liang Henlu anywhere. Liu Kai carefully observed the surroundings and then burst into laughter.
0:28:14|0:28:22|[Liu Kai] shrank his head and slowly turned around to look behind him, where Liang Henlu stood straight, staring at him, with a long knife pointed at his neck.
0:28:30|0:28:47|[Liu Kai] turned around and gave orders, and several people swam towards the center of the river together. [Qiu Dongyue], who had been living in seclusion in the deep mountains for many years, still had the same determined look in his eyes as in the past. He looked at his beard, took out a brush, dipped it in the ink, and brushed it on his beard to make himself look younger.
0:29:13|0:29:22|Stubborn [Qiu Dongyue] finally decided to come down the mountain. When he reached the foot of the mountain, he saw the hunter from years ago, who was leaning against the door and sleeping.
0:29:25|0:29:28|The hunter stood up and scooped up a ladle of water.
0:30:9|0:30:13|[Qiu Dongyue] got up and left one or two pieces of silver on the stool, and the hunter quickly got up.
0:30:25|0:30:40|[Qiu Dongyue] left the hunter's house and arrived at a low mud house. Inside the courtyard, there were piles of firewood and salted vegetables drying on the ground. [Madam Qiu] sat in the courtyard, gently patting the child in her arms. The child saw him and smiled at him.
0:31:6|0:31:12|[Qiu Dongyue] drank water, listened to the goose driver, took out a few pieces of silver from his clothes, handed them to the goose driver, and then got up.
0:31:16|0:31:24|Madam Qiu pushed open the door with a child in her arms, Qiu Dongyue sat there for a moment lost in thought, not understanding why Madam Qiu was calling her into the room.
0:31:24|0:31:38|In the room, [Madam Qiu] held a child, bent over by the bedside, lying on the bed was the man with a broken leg, [Madam Qiu] whispered something to him, and the man quickly got up, took the child from [Madam Qiu]'s arms, and limped out of the room.
0:31:38|0:31:43|Passing by Qiu Dongyue, he smiled and nodded at Qiu Dongyue, then casually closed the door.
0:31:44|0:31:50|[Qiu Dongyue] watched the man leave, then looked at [Madam Qiu] sitting on the bed with a puzzled expression on her face.
0:31:51|0:32:5|Madam Qiu sat by the bed and placed the silver she had just received on the bed. Qiu Dongyue walked up to Madam Qiu from the doorway and looked at the silver on the bed.
0:32:32|0:32:44|Madam Qiu lay down on the bed, half kneeling, and pulled Qiu Dongyue's clothes corner with one hand. Seeing no response from Qiu Dongyue, Madam Qiu pulled harder a few times and then looked up at him.
0:32:59|0:33:18|Qiu Dongyue's hand gently turned, and the changed hand slipped along with his foot, then he turned and walked towards the door. The changed one sat on the bed with empty eyes, watching Qiu Dongyue leave. Qiu Dongyue opened the door, took a deep breath, and Liang Henlu sat at the door, saying to Qiu Dongyue.
0:33:18|0:33:37|The old man, [Qiu Dongyue], turned around and looked at the man herding geese, who smiled warmly at her. Ignoring the man, [Qiu Dongyue] took out a few pieces of silver and threw them back. The man saw the silver and quickly knelt down, picking up the silver and looking at [Qiu Dongyue] with a flattering expression.
0:33:39|0:33:56|[Qiu Dongyue] left home and headed towards Shuangye City alone. However, due to her advancing age, her physical strength was not as good as before. She had to rest against a tree stump every few steps. When she reached the poor mine area, [Qiu Dongyue] even extended her arms and performed a few martial arts moves while walking.
0:33:56|0:34:7|Entering a state of ease, [Qiu Dongyue] unburdens herself of the weight on her shoulders, casually tossing it away into the empty space in front of her. With a fluid motion, she gracefully moves her hands in a cloud-like manner, displaying a relaxed and versatile style, with a variety of techniques.
0:34:8|0:34:27|His movements are mostly direct and straightforward, each move is precise and powerful. When throwing punches, he is focused and agile, seamlessly integrating his body movements and footwork. His entire body seems to be twisted like a rope. His upper body is upright, footwork is steady, movements are firm yet not rigid, soft yet not weak. He uses his back to support the hips, hips to support the knees, and knees to drive the feet, moving in a straight line with powerful force.
0:34:28|0:34:40|With the left palm rotating outward, twisting with force and delivering a straight punch upwards, then twisting inward with force and pulling back towards the waist in a defensive posture, the hands strike outward, achieving a harmonious blend of strength and flexibility, becoming one entity.
0:34:42|0:34:59|In the cargo hold of the colorful boat, three women of the same family gathered together, chatting and laughing. The four elders of the four major sects lay on the grandmaster chairs, silent on the side. Although the room was filled with people, the only sounds were the chatter and laughter of women, occasionally interrupted by the creaking of the grandmaster chairs.
0:34:59|0:35:10|Madam Qiu, who was resting with her eyes closed, opened her eyes upon hearing the commotion. She glanced in the direction of the three women, who were talking non-stop, and then turned to look at Mr. Lu and Mr. Cai sitting opposite her.
0:35:12|0:35:36|In front of a group of women, there were drinks and various snacks on the floor. They kept talking and laughing. After receiving instructions from Qi Lao, the servant turned and walked towards the three women on the side. Upon seeing the servant, the three women not only did not stop, but laughed even louder.
0:35:39|0:35:51|Master Lu saw that Madam Qiu's servants had disappeared, so he sent his own servants to investigate. The two servants stood in front of three foreign women, staring at them intently, but both of them never returned.
0:35:51|0:35:58|The four elders of the Four Great Gates all turned to look to the side. After a while, Lu Lao's servant turned and left, and Madam Qiu's servant followed suit.
0:36:19|0:36:31|The four young masters of the Si Da Men laughed one after another, and their servants beside them couldn't help but laugh as well. The three foreign women all stopped smiling when they saw this.
0:36:59|0:37:10|After exchanging a glance, Cai Lao and Lu Lao nodded at each other in agreement. After speaking, they both sat back on their grandmaster chairs, and Wang Lao also followed suit in agreement.
0:37:12|0:37:30|Shortly after, the servant of [Madam Qiu] walked towards the warehouse. Just as he reached the door, a person wearing a bamboo hat walked in. Squinting, [Madam Qiu] slowly opened her eyes when she saw the figure, and then lifted her head from the grandmaster chair. The other three sect leaders, upon seeing this, all stood up from their chairs in unison.
0:37:30|0:37:40|Madam Qiu slowly stood up as she saw the actions of the three individuals. When the man with the straw hat came in, instead of walking towards the house, he sat on the wooden cart near the door.
0:37:42|0:37:51|Afterwards, [Qiu Dongyue] untied the gourd containing wine from his waist, took a few sips, and silently watched the people in the room, while [Madam Qiu] kept looking at the person at the door.
0:37:56|0:38:2|[Qiu Dongyue] covered half of her face with a bamboo hat, but the people present still recognized her.
0:38:6|0:38:20|On the boat, [Qiu Dongyue] grasped a long stick with both hands, leaned back with her neck, facing upwards on both sides, and wearily leaned against the chair. Another strange noise came from outside the boat, [Qiu Dongyue] immediately became highly alert, and slowly extended the long stick in her hand towards the curtain again.
0:38:20|0:38:40|Outside the bed, the heads of the four major sects sat side by side on chairs, with two servants holding long-handled broadswords in front of them, turning towards the direction of the boat. After quickly jumping onto the deck, they swung their swords towards the sticks, but fell to the ground as soon as they made a move. The heads of the four major sects couldn't sit still after seeing this.
0:38:59|0:39:18|In our Central Plains martial arts, Master Wang was still trying to explain to the three foreign women, but was interrupted by Master Qie's two clear coughs. The three foreign women shrugged, indicating their confusion. Soon after, four servants walked towards the shore, carrying a boat-shaped stretcher to the two servants who had collapsed on the deck.
0:40:26|0:40:33|Qiu Dongyue carefully analyzed the direction of the boat. The servants also placed the unconscious person into a stretcher on the boat.
0:41:6|0:41:20|[Qiu Dongyue] lowered his head and pondered for a moment. With the people from the four major sects, he arrived at the warehouse. He paced back and forth, and the atmosphere remained tense. The leaders of the four sects kept a close eye on [Qiu Dongyue], each person waiting for him to speak.
0:42:11|0:42:19|Three women of the Qiu family sat on the ground in the cargo hold. At mealtime, servants brought snacks and drinks, and the three of them happily chatted again.
0:42:23|0:42:28|[Qiu Dongyue] watched as these young exotic women touched their own chin beards.
0:42:36|0:42:55|The beards of the four grandmasters all showed visible signs of aging. However, at this moment, [Madam Qiu]'s beard seemed somewhat out of place. After the meal, [Madam Qiu] prepared to take action personally. Under the gaze of the four grandmasters, dozens of servants, and three foreign women, she walked towards the direction of the boat.
0:42:55|0:43:5|He strode towards the steps by the shore, stepped onto the boarding plank, and arrived on the deck of the fishing boat. Standing behind the cabin door, he unfastened the cord buckle on his chest, and the wound on his back naturally fell open.
0:43:9|0:43:33|[Madam Qiu] quickly grabbed the two guns. In Madam Qiu's mind, she already had a method to kill with one shot, the move had already been rehearsed in her mind. Once she confirmed the position of the head, the person inside the door would directly lose their life.
0:43:41|0:43:43|The enemy has not launched the second attack yet.
0:44:4|0:44:18|[Qiu Dongyue] caught the flaw in Ru Xiang's plan, calculating that when she officially struck, her skills would be agile enough to dodge in advance and still be able to strike the enemy fatally. The heads of the four major factions on the shore, along with dozens of servants, all eagerly awaited.
0:44:29|0:44:49|[Qiu Dongyue] thought of himself as the top martial artist in the martial arts world, feeling that his previous thoughts were not righteous enough. Therefore, he decided to abandon his skills and use straightforward kung fu to attack. Once again, he calculated in his mind, thinking that he could easily kill the people inside the gate with his own kung fu. With various methods to win in one move, he was already clear in his mind.
0:44:55|0:45:10|In the end, he decided to confront the people inside the gate with the second method. He crossed the two guns in front of his chest, and the person inside the gate lifted the head of the stick. The people on the shore watched nervously as Qiu Dongyue approached and tapped the stick head with the gun.
0:45:10|0:45:20|In his mind, he had already dodged the attack of the stick, but in reality, his body had only moved half an inch, and the stick had accurately hit his neck.
0:46:25|0:46:42|After Liu Kai finished speaking angrily, [Liang Henlu] remained calm, looking at Liu Kai with a faint expression. He silently lifted the long knife underwater and pointed it towards Liu Kai. Liu Kai used his hand to move the long knife away from his face.
0:46:51|0:46:53|The two [Qiu Dongyue]s slowly put down their long knives.
0:47:13|0:47:27|Liu Kai turned around and waved his hand, leading his men to swim forward again. [Liang Henlu] followed closely behind, and the teapot filled with tea water by the riverbank had already boiled completely, with thick mist continuously pouring out from the lid and spout.
0:47:27|0:47:40|Qiu Dongyue, who fainted on the ground, has been carried into a stretcher by the servants. In order to cover up his aging beard, he secretly tied up his long and fierce beard with a beard bag, which has now fallen off during the fight, looking extremely embarrassed.
0:47:50|0:48:9|Following behind the stretcher on the boat, Madam Qiu walked towards Qiu Dongyue's former home. Along the way, Qiu Dongyue's consciousness slowly returned, and he let out a breath, weakly saying.
0:48:12|0:48:16|Upon hearing Elder Qie's command, Qiu Dongyue turned around and walked in the opposite direction.
0:48:30|0:48:42|Upon hearing this, they placed him in the courtyard outside the main hall. Qie Lao made a move, causing the people around him to leave. After Park Yi left, he took a few steps towards Qiu Dongyue's direction.
0:48:44|0:48:49|Without facing [Qiu Dongyue], he walked to the pillar and then spoke.
0:50:32|0:50:36|Qiu Dongyue leaned back against the stretcher behind him, allowing his upper body to relax.
0:50:45|0:50:55|Upon hearing what Qiu Dongyue said, [Madam Qiu] slowly turned around to look at him, wanting to say something but then stopped. She then bent down and leaned in closer to Qiu Dongyue to speak.
0:52:19|0:52:40|Qiu Dongyue briefly explained and then closed his eyes again, unwilling to listen to the old man's words. On the colorful boat by the river, everything remained the same. The three sect leaders and three foreign girls were lying in the cargo hold, each resting in a different position. One warrior after another fell on the deck of the boat.
0:52:40|0:52:50|On the other side, with Liang Henlu's permission, Liu Kai and the soldiers finally climbed up the bank. Liang Henlu lay beside the pile of connecting rods, picked up a piece with his hand, and put it into his mouth.
0:52:57|0:53:12|Liang Henlu turned to look at Liu Kai, then took the cue stick out of his mouth. Liang Henlu took out a bundle of hemp rope from his chest and threw it to [Liu Kai]. [Liu Kai] picked up the hemp rope and immediately understood.
0:53:15|0:53:26|[Liu Kai] successively tied up the hands and feet of the four soldiers, then handed the remaining piece of hemp rope to Liang Henlu. Liang Henlu looked at the hemp rope, then glanced at [Liu Kai], a sly smile appearing on his lips.
0:53:55|0:53:57|The specially made paper solidifies afterwards.
0:54:7|0:54:19|After finishing speaking, Qiu Dongyue bit the wooden stick handed by Liang Henlu, everything was tied up, and he obediently squeezed in with four soldiers. Liang Henlu picked up a street pole and threw it on them, hiding them under the pile of street poles.
0:54:20|0:54:37|Qiu Dongyue lay on the carpet in the hall, constantly patting his right arm with his left hand, mechanically repeating this action over and over. Suddenly, he unfastened the wristband on his left arm, yanked it off, and quickly got up to walk out the door.
0:54:37|0:54:51|The old man sweeping the floor in the Qie Lao Mansion slowly walked down from upstairs, holding a weapon in his hands that seemed very important. He approached the front door, where [Qiu Dongyue] was organizing her belongings.
0:54:51|0:55:7|The old man sweeping the floor stood beside him, not interrupting his movements, just holding the weapon and bowing, waiting. When Qiu Dongyue finished cleaning up, he reached out to the side, and the old man sweeping the floor quickly handed him the weapon.
0:55:34|0:55:54|Qiu Dongyue refused the close protection of the bodyguard and left home alone with a weapon in hand. He arrived at a deserted bridge, looked around anxiously, and then carefully confirmed that there was no one around. After that, he put down the weapon on his shoulder, held it in both hands, tapped it for a while, and quickly uncovered the cloth covering the weapon.
0:55:54|0:55:59|A Taiji whip appeared, known as the Taiji whip in the martial arts world.
0:56:0|0:56:18|[Qiu Dongyue] wielded the whip with great strength and fierceness, the movements were intense and powerful, the whip crackled like the wind, fast but not chaotic, seemingly endless variations yet able to move freely. At this moment, [Qiu Dongyue] was still unaware of some events happening in the mansion, the fire in the prison cell had long been extinguished, leaving only some residual smoke drifting in the room.
0:56:39|0:56:57|Quickly rushing over, [Qiu Dongyue] cut the hemp rope on his left hand and foot, caught him steadily, and then carried him out. He hesitated for a moment, but fearing that someone might come suddenly, he ran non-stop towards the outside. After running two steps, he stopped again.
0:57:0|0:57:18|When Liang Henlu tried to pull out the long knife from the beam, Qiu Dongyue refused him. He was puzzled, but still carried Qiu Dongyue back to the pile of poles. After putting Qiu Dongyue down, he tore open the clothes on her calf, causing Qiu Dongyue to grimace in pain.
0:57:45|0:57:51|Upon hearing these words from [Qiu Dongyue], [Liang Henlu] stared at him with wide eyes, unable to believe that those words came from him.
0:58:5|0:58:16|After speaking, [Qiu Dongyue] turned around without hesitation and walked towards the shore. Liu Kai and his men in the street stall were stunned by this scene. [Liang Henlu] picked up the long knife and scabbard from the ground, looking at [Qiu Dongyue] with a cold face.
0:58:27|0:58:40|After tossing the scabbard to [Qiu Dongyue], Liang Henlu strode away from the riverbank. The left-handed fighter picked up a wooden stick and threw it into the river. It wasn't until everything outside calmed down that the people tied up in the pile of poles finally breathed a sigh of relief.
0:58:44|0:59:5|At this moment, while the colorful boat was surrounded by a lively scene on the shore, three sect leaders stood on a high platform, solemnly watching below. Below the platform, three exotic women were dancing, lifting their skirts and swaying rhythmically to the music. Dozens of sword-wielding warriors sat on both sides, all staring intently at the three dancers.
0:59:5|0:59:12|The three of them became more and more unrestrained in their movements, swaying their waists. Even the servant who was boiling water in the distance couldn't help but look over.
0:59:13|0:59:32|Suddenly, [Madam Qiu] appeared at the riverside with a riding crop in hand. The servants who were boiling water quickly stood up and saluted. [Madam Qiu] glared angrily at the scene, but to her dismay, dozens of people on the shore were all captivated by the pensive look of the foreign woman Aluo, and no one noticed her arrival. She walked up to Master Lu and asked:
0:59:50|0:59:56|Madam Qiu looked at the group of women swaying their waists below the stage, and asked Mr. Lu again. Mr. Lu replied.
1:0:0|1:0:10|Qiu Dongyue circled around Mr. Lu, her eyes never leaving him for a moment. After she sat down in the center, Madam Qiu said, "[Wang Lao]."
1:0:18|1:0:42|[Wang Lao] smiled with one side of his mouth, and at this moment, the three foreign women stopped dancing. They rushed onto the stage, surrounded Madam Qiu, and clamored for wine. Seeing Madam Qiu not responding, they said something in their own dialect that only they could understand, and then burst into laughter. Madam Qiu closed her eyes and leaned back against the chair behind her.
1:0:51|1:1:3|On the other side of the street, Liu Kai and the others saw Madam Qiu passing by. They tried to catch her attention with some noises, but Madam Qiu remained completely unaware and just kept walking forward.
1:1:3|1:1:11|Qiu Dongyue, who was resting with his eyes closed, immediately opened his eyes upon hearing footsteps. He then picked up the empty pouch beside him and covered the beard on his chin.
1:1:16|1:1:31|Madam Qiu, wearing a bamboo hat, walked towards the stretcher where Qiu Dongyue was lying on the boat. Her face was cold, she lifted her clothes and squatted beside Qiu Dongyue. The sun in front of her face was suddenly blocked, and Qiu Dongyue frowned slightly and opened his eyes.
1:2:20|1:2:40|Madam Qiu clenched the dagger in her hands, pointing the blade towards Qiu Dongyue's chest. With her eyes closed, she was about to strike Qiu Dongyue when a noise came from behind. She turned to look towards the source of the sound and saw someone throwing firewood into the backyard.
1:2:42|1:3:7|He walked into the backyard, sneaking along the wall to observe, and saw [Liang Henlu] carrying firewood. In an instant, their eyes met, and [Liang Henlu] dropped the firewood on his shoulder, clenched his fist. Before two moves had passed, [Liang Henlu]'s big knife was already at [Madam Qiu]'s neck, but [Madam Qiu] remained calm.
1:3:14|1:3:20|The two temporarily reconciled, with [Liang Henlu] sitting on a pile of firewood, constantly striking a flint.
1:4:16|1:4:33|[Qiu Dongyue] overheard the conversation between the two in the stretcher passing by the front yard. After getting a response from [Madam Qiu], [Liang Henlu] dropped the food in his hand, picked up a long knife, and led her to the other side.
1:4:33|1:4:39|The two arrived at a side room, where [Liang Henlu] took out a hemp rope several meters long and hung it on the lantern high above the door.
1:4:41|1:5:0|Suddenly, footsteps were heard from the side corridor. [Liang Henlu] and [Madam Qiu] quickly retreated into the room and closed the door. As the door closed, two servants carrying wine and a stone box emerged from the corridor. After the two had walked away, [Liang Henlu] began the next step of the operation.
1:5:0|1:5:7|Half an hour more and it will be dark. Once the lanterns are lit from these two angles, before people come in, the shadows will have arrived first.
1:5:10|1:5:15|[Liang Henlu] drew a point on the ground with a long knife, then reached out a hand towards [Madam Qiu].
1:5:16|1:5:32|[Liang Henlu] looked at the earrings of [Madam Qiu], and reached out his hand. As [Madam Qiu] was taking off the earrings, [Liang Henlu] used a long knife to cut the hemp rope, with half of it falling on [Madam Qiu]. [Liang Henlu] stared at [Madam Qiu], slowly retrieving the hemp rope from her body.
1:5:34|1:5:53|Throughout the scene, [Madam Qiu] never took her eyes off [Liang Henlu]. Instead of responding to her gaze, [Liang Henlu] naturally lowered his head, twisted a hemp rope, then tucked it into his clothes. He then reached out a hand towards [Madam Qiu], who handed him an earring.
1:5:53|1:6:1|[Liang Henlu] placed the earring at the designated spot and both stood up. As the shadow reached the top of the earring,
1:6:15|1:6:25|Liang Henlu stared straight into her eyes, took a step closer to her, and pressed against [Madam Qiu]'s arm. After a moment, he picked up a long stick from the room.
1:6:42|1:6:46|Madam Qiu dropped the long stick, pulled out a dagger, and quickly stabbed towards Liang Henlu.
1:7:7|1:7:24|After speaking, Liang Henlu carried two lanterns in the room and walked towards the door, then hung the lanterns on the hooks above the beams. He used the long knife in his hand to push up, and the two lanterns hung steadily above.
1:7:36|1:7:53|On the bank of the Qinhuai River, three exotic women were already clanging cymbals loudly, urging the warriors to dance together. One warrior, upon seeing this scene, dropped his big sword and stood up to join the dance. Dozens of other warriors around stood there blankly, unmoved.
1:7:54|1:8:12|Three exotic women stood up to greet each other, and the warrior, forgetting himself, wandered freely between the three women. Suddenly, Madam Qiu appeared behind him and swung the Taiji whip in her hand towards the warrior, who instantly fainted to the ground.
1:8:29|1:8:50|After Mr. Qi finished speaking, he seemed to be staring in the direction of the boat. The leaders of the other three sects looked at each other. The three foreign women were escorted into the water dungeon in fear.
1:8:56|1:9:10|The leading warrior, Qiu Dongyue, stared straight at the three foreign women, while the four people behind her followed her steps and approached the foreign women, closing the gate of the water dungeon. The foreign women hugged each other, fearfully stepping back repeatedly.
1:9:40|1:9:50|The leading warrior turned around to look at the person behind him, took off the wooden hairpin from his own head, then took off others', held them in his hand, broke the hairpins, and held one end in his palm.
1:9:59|1:10:8|The other four warriors each drew a wooden hairpin and stood in the corner. Madam Qiu, with her hands crossed over her chest, watched them with great interest.
1:10:15|1:10:37|The leading samurai, upon hearing this, turned to look at a group of women. After a moment of thought, she turned back to look at the other samurai. Before she could react, the others had already turned to the water to retrieve weapons. Once everyone had their weapons, the fighting among the samurai began. As the sound of swords clashing was heard, they all screamed and moved closer to the corner of the wall.
1:10:37|1:10:44|Inside the water dungeon, apart from the screams of women, there was only the sound of swords clashing between warriors. After a while, the fighting finally ceased.
1:10:45|1:11:11|In the water dungeon, silence prevailed. A group of women hiding in the corner looked up, only to see a fallen warrior by the stone steps of the dungeon gate. The lone warrior gazed at the fallen comrade, tears streaming down his face. After a moment, he turned and walked towards the group of women in the corner.
1:11:19|1:11:41|A woman from the clan, holding a long knife she had picked up at some point, flanked the warrior on both sides and knocked him out cold. Escaping from the water dungeon, the woman arrived at the back courtyard of the concubine's residence next to a pile of poles, planning to use it to scale the wall. Suddenly, several people emerged from the pile of poles beside her.
1:11:48|1:12:3|In the crowded street, Liu Kai and his group of five people, with their feet tied by hemp ropes, could only hop towards a woman from the Qiu family. The woman from the Qiu family, upon seeing this, retreated in fear. On the other side, by the bank of the Qinhuai River, a pot of scalding hot oil had already boiled over.
1:12:3|1:12:11|Madam Qiu sat in a chair, propping her head with one hand pretending to be asleep, while a servant added a bucket of cold oil into the hot pot.
1:12:20|1:12:27|The servant continued to add grains and oil inside, when suddenly, the sound of swords clashing could be heard from the shore.
1:12:35|1:12:55|A warrior saw someone falling in battle and approached alone. He held a long-handled broadsword and swung it towards the long-handled axe. The lever pushed his hand forward, and the axe blade cut through the warrior's clothes. The warrior looked at his legs, the clothes were all torn, but his flesh was unharmed. His legs began to tremble uncontrollably.
1:12:55|1:12:58|The lover on the high platform saw this and walked down to the side of the warrior.
1:13:5|1:13:23|After receiving the order from [Madam Qiu], the warrior stepped back. [Madam Qiu] assumed a fighting stance, and Gan Gang placed the wooden handle of the long-handled axe on [Madam Qiu]'s arm. Then, with a gentle movement, before Gan Gang could defend himself, he knelt down on the ground. Gan Gang looked up at [Madam Qiu] and said.
1:13:40|1:13:45|My young lady... Madam Qiu's eyes suddenly turned cold, and I couldn't help but shudder after seeing it.
1:14:5|1:14:12|Mr. Xie took off his personal jade pendant from his waist and half-squatted to pick it up.
1:15:9|1:15:24|Gan Gang clenched his fists tightly upon hearing this, suppressing the anger in his heart. He gritted his teeth and spoke, then took a few steps back and left the shore. Madam Qiu then put the Tai Shi whip back on the shelf.
1:15:28|1:15:36|At this moment, inside the concubine's residence, [Madam Qiu] stood at the door holding a long wooden stick, with two lanterns lit on the door. She shouted loudly towards the front courtyard.
1:15:42|1:15:56|After shouting loudly, he walked into the room, holding a wooden stick and hiding behind the door, fully focused on staring at the spot where [Liang Henlu] placed the earring. Moments later, the warriors in the front yard heard the noise and gathered in the backyard with their long knives.
1:15:56|1:16:4|After observing the situation carefully, a warrior slowly walked towards the house with a knife in hand, his shadow reflecting inside the room, the shadow's head getting closer to the earring.
1:16:8|1:16:25|Madam Qiu seized the opportunity and struck, causing the first warrior to fall to the ground. Inside the colorful boat on the Qinhuai River, Qiu Dongyue rested briefly with a long stick in her arms. Suddenly, a noise came from the window behind her, and Liang Henlu jumped in from outside.
1:16:25|1:16:48|She looked at [Sailan] at the door, gently withdrew the long knife, but [Sailan] still woke up immediately. After Sailan finished speaking, she fainted on the ground. [Liang Henlu] held a water pot and slowly helped him drink. Sailan, who was choked by the water, grabbed the water pot and stood up to drink fiercely. [Liang Henlu] smiled as he watched.
1:17:31|1:17:56|Upon hearing this, [Liang Henlu] didn't say anything more, just looked at Sairan. By the Qinhuai River bank, Qie Lao watched the boiling oil pot, took the water ladle handed by Lu Lao, scooped up a ladle of hot oil from the hot pot in front of him. Then, he walked slowly to the edge of the Tai Chi field, starting from the edge, and poured the hot oil little by little onto the Tai Chi edge.
1:17:56|1:18:0|As soon as Qiu Dongyue's body touched the hot oil, it made a sizzling sound.
1:18:3|1:18:13|After Gan Gang left the riverside, he headed straight to the Qiu's residence. Qiu Dongyue, who was lying in the middle of the courtyard, heard footsteps and threw the hat dropped by Madam Qiu towards a distance.
1:19:29|1:19:58|After speaking, the two servants lifted the sedan chair and carried Madam Qiu to the backyard. The armed warriors made way, allowing Qiu Dongyue to pass through them and be placed by the servants in a bright spot in front of the door. A warrior with a sword in hand walked towards the house, as Qiu Dongyue said to the attendant beside her.
1:20:8|1:20:25|Gan Gang looked at the warrior, only to see the warrior holding a knife, rushing quickly towards the doorway. Inside the house, [Madam Qiu] immediately became alert, staring at the earring. The warrior outside rushed into the house, but before he could step inside, [Madam Qiu] struck him on the head with a stick, causing him to immediately faint on the ground.
1:20:28|1:20:31|[Qiu Dongyue] speaks to Gan Gang again.
1:22:0|1:22:15|In the colorful boat on the other side, [Liang Henlu] lay on the ground, his eyes filled with drowsiness, but he dared not relax, still carefully listening to the sounds outside. Sairan slept heavily on his legs, while Qie Lao walked down from the high platform with a Tai Chi whip in hand.
1:22:46|1:22:55|Stopping near the ship's curtain, he looked at it and recalled the scene when [Qiu Dongyue] went up the mountain to seclude herself.
1:23:11|1:23:34|He calculated in his mind the attacking moves, thinking about how to use the Tai Chi whip to suppress the opponent's long stick. After planning the steps, he was confident and gently approached the end of the Tai Chi whip towards Liang Henlu's extended long stick.
1:23:38|1:23:55|As the stick was about to hit Qie Lao's face, he quickly blocked and counterattacked. Following the connection, Sairan and [Liang Henlu] worked together to resist Qie Lao's incoming Tai Chi whip, and then deflected the whip head. For a moment, Qie Lao could only retreat to a safe zone.
1:23:55|1:24:5|They could have killed him. On the high platform, the leaders of the three major sects exchanged glances, while Madam Qiu kept a close eye on the long stick.
1:24:13|1:24:27|In the mansion, under the guidance of Qiu Dongyue, Gan Gang carefully moved the lantern on the door forward by an inch with the long-handled axe in his hand. Qiu Dongyue propped up his body inside the single row of houses and watched Gan Gang.
1:24:27|1:24:39|Gan Gang slowly extended the big axe into the room after slightly moving the lantern. [Madam Qiu], who was resting with her eyes closed, immediately became alert, opened her eyes, gripped the long stick in her hand, and stared at the earring on the ground.
1:24:43|1:24:58|After the shadow's head and earrings overlapped, [Madam Qiu] swung outwards, but missed, as Gan Gang's long-handled axe slid behind the door. [Madam Qiu] quickly changed direction and arrived behind the left door, where Gan Gang struck again, landing a solid blow on [Madam Qiu].
1:24:58|1:25:7|At the same time, Madam Qiu was also struck by Gan Gang's long-handled axe, blood seeping from her clothes, and finally she slid down the door frame, unable to kneel up.
1:25:8|1:25:25|[Qiu Dongyue] saw the two men fall to the ground, relaxed her upper body, and silently lay back in the room. Everything that just happened was a fantasy in [Qiu Dongyue]'s mind. This move is a mutually destructive tactic, once used, both [Madam Qiu] and the lever will lose their lives.
1:25:25|1:25:37|But [Qiu Dongyue] already had a plan to save herself in mind. She propped up her upper body with force, carefully observing the doorway, adjusting her breathing with the lever, gripping the long-handled axe in her hand, ready to make her move.
1:25:39|1:25:56|Madam Qiu was ready for the imminent death inside the door. The lever slowly moved towards the house, the shadow getting closer. As Madam Qiu's stick extended, Qiu Dongyue quickly acted, reaching into the house with the dual guns in hand as the lever's big axe swung upwards.
1:25:56|1:26:2|A shot sent the long handle of the big axe flying, hitting the stick head extended by Madam Qiu.
1:26:4|1:26:14|Madam Qiu was hit by her own stick, which rebounded and hit the lever, causing both of them to fall to the ground. Qiu Dongyue collapsed inside the stretcher.
1:26:18|1:26:36|After hearing this, Madam Qiu clenched her fists, turned around, and said a few words. After speaking, [Qiu Dongyue] turned to look at [Liang Henlu]. Taking a few steps forward, right in front of the door curtain, he half-bent his knees, raised the Tai Chi whip, and moved forward step by step. He was cautious, staring at the stick head deep inside the door curtain.
1:26:38|1:26:51|Slowly bring the tip of the Tai Chi whip close to the stick body, then quickly strike the stick body. Inside the door curtain, [Liang Henlu], with the help of Sairan, quickly retracts the long stick. At the moment the stick disappears, [Qiu Dongyue] is stunned.
1:26:51|1:26:58|In the moment he hesitated, [Liang Henlu] swiftly sent out his stick, and as [Qiu Dongyue] grabbed onto it, Sairan pulled the stick back.
1:26:59|1:27:17|Taking advantage of [Qiu Dongyue]'s unpreparedness, he swiftly swung the stick. In the blink of an eye, [Qiu Dongyue] reacted a beat too slow, and the stick landed directly on his face. Subsequently, [Qiu Dongyue] fell backwards onto the ground. Seeing [Qiu Dongyue] fall, [Liang Henlu] retracted the stick.
1:27:19|1:27:26|At this moment, the quiet Chevene was only filled with the chirping of crickets. After [Qiu Dongyue] fainted to the ground, she gradually regained consciousness.
1:27:26|1:27:41|He opened his eyes, trying hard to regain consciousness. Madam Qiu, who had fainted by the door, also woke up. He looked up and saw that the person outside the door was actually Qiu Dongyue. He stepped over the fallen warrior, got up, and walked towards Qiu Dongyue.
1:27:41|1:27:46|[Qiu Dongyue] at this moment also made an effort to prop himself up and saw [Madam Qiu] walking towards him.
1:27:48|1:28:6|Madam Qiu squatted beside Qiu Dongyue, the two embracing tightly. Qiu Dongyue, seeing them hugging, leaned back and lay back in the stretcher. At this moment, she looked at the pitch-black sky, feeling very conflicted.
1:28:6|1:28:13|She could have let both of them perish and save her own reputation, but in the end, she let it go.
1:28:15|1:28:29|Several swordsmen stood aside with their blades, silently watching the scene in front of them. Suddenly, a man's voice came from behind.
1:28:37|1:28:59|The warriors approached and found it was a left-handed swordsman. He took three steps forward, drew his long sword, and advanced with large strides, parrying and blocking with his left and right, calling on the four warriors in front. Qiu Dongyue lay on a stretcher, weakly watching the scene. Meanwhile, the two who had just narrowly experienced a life-and-death separation, Madam Qiu and Liang Henlu, still embraced each other.
1:29:16|1:29:30|Just as Qiu Dongyue defeated four warriors in the left chamber, three foreign women and Liang Henlu appeared behind him. The left chamber raised his long knife, ready to fight back.
1:29:33|1:29:51|[Liu Kai] and two other soldiers snatched the shield from a woman of the clan, while two soldiers behind them held spears with hidden firearms. Faced with such a formation, it was difficult for the Left Flank Formation to resist, so they could only flee outward, but the Mandarin Duck Formation pursued closely, with the three women of the clan following closely behind.
1:29:51|1:29:58|After running for a while, the injured right leg forced Liang Henlu to stop, and Liu Kai along with four soldiers were already exhausted.
1:29:59|1:30:17|Liang Henlu fought desperately, knocking down several soldiers in a row. Qiu Dongyue held a shield in front of his chest, engaging in a fierce battle with the left-leaning fighter wielding a long knife. Ultimately, in close combat, the long knife failed to show its advantage, and Liang Henlu was pinned down by Qiu Dongyue.
1:30:40|1:31:2|Three women of different ethnicities were playing around and ran away from the scene. Liu Kai also fainted next to [Liang Henlu]'s room. The old concubine who had just come down from the sedan chair was carried on a stretcher by four servants and taken down the boat. Subsequently, dozens of archers gathered on the shore, pulling their bows and arrows, while two servants carried hundreds of arrows to the side.
1:31:2|1:31:6|The heads of the three major sects walked to the front of the formation, and Old Cai spoke to the people on the boat.
1:31:43|1:31:51|Upon hearing the words from the people on the shore, [Qiu Dongyue] silently retracted the stick. Mr. Wang and Mr. Cai exchanged a glance, then looked back towards the direction of the boat.
1:31:54|1:32:5|The ship finally showed some movement. The water surface made noises along with the movement on the ship, and dozens of archers on the shore aimed their bows at the ship.
1:32:5|1:32:24|[Liang Henlu] slowly walked out of the ship, holding a long stick on the deck. However, seeing the archers' posture, she shifted the long stick to her side, ready to draw her long knife at any moment to fight. The four major sects still adhered to the agreement, and the next morning, [Liang Henlu] walked in the boundless alley.
1:32:30|1:32:49|Approaching the first door, [Qiu Dongyue] stood in the courtyard, extending her right hand to signal [Liang Henlu] to move back. [Liang Henlu] and the left-leaning envoy had not yet drawn their swords, but they passed through the first gate. Their eyes raised, they walked towards the second gate. When they reached the second gate.
1:32:50|1:33:7|Upon seeing Qiu Dongyue and Liang Henlu, Mr. Lu immediately set down his bow and arrow. The two of them, with their knives still in hand and not drawn out, smoothly passed through the second gate. As they approached the third gate, they saw Mr. Cai extending his Tai Chi whip. When they faced each other at the gate, Mr. Cai noticed the two of them.
1:33:10|1:33:19|Upon seeing Master Cai put down his Tai Chi whip, Qiu Dongyue and Liang Henlu turned around and headed towards the fourth door. As they walked towards the fourth door, they still had some worries in their hearts.
1:33:21|1:33:29|After a brief pause in place, the two of them continued towards the fourth door, gripping the long stick trailing behind them.
1:33:29|1:33:41|Approaching the fourth door step by step, which is the final challenge unexpectedly, [Madam Qiu] holds a Tai Chi whip, with [Liang Henlu] standing beside her with dual guns. The two outside the door and the two inside the door gaze at each other.
1:33:42|1:33:59|Shortly after, [Qiu Dongyue] and [Liang Henlu] walked into the courtyard together. After standing still for a moment in the courtyard and seeing no movement from [Madam Qiu] and [Liang Henlu], the two of them took the initiative to approach. As their eyes met, although it was the beginning of a war, the smell of gunpowder had already filled the air.
1:33:59|1:34:11|At this moment, Mr. Lu, Mr. Wang, and Mr. Cai arrived at the concubine's residence. After entering the courtyard, the three men tightly closed the main gate, not allowing any dentists to enter.
1:34:13|1:34:33|After the sound of the door closing, the courtyard once again fell into silence, with no movement at all. It was [Madam Qiu] who first broke the deadlock. She extended the Tai Chi whip towards [Qiu Dongyue], who responded alertly. Between the two of them, they unexpectedly found themselves in a stalemate.
1:34:33|1:34:41|The long knife wielded by Liang Henlu has already blocked in front of [Madam Qiu], while [Madam Qiu]'s Tai Chi whip is also pressed against Liang Henlu's neck.
1:34:58|1:35:8|After listening to what Madam Qiu said, Liang Henlu took a step back, then Madam Qiu retracted her Tai Chi whip and walked away. Liang Henlu followed Madam Qiu and stood under the eaves.
1:35:11|1:35:24|In the courtyard, only Qiu Dongyue and [Liang Henlu] remained. Qiu Dongyue nodded towards him, and [Liang Henlu] responded to Qiu Dongyue, then quickly squatted down, gripping the handle of the knife with his right hand.
1:36:23|1:36:32|[Qiu Dongyue] looked at [Liang Henlu], took off the cumbersome coat, and casually threw it to the young man behind her.
1:36:38|1:36:44|[Qiu Dongyue] stepped back, then moved diagonally to the left, and swiftly moved diagonally to the right.
1:36:46|1:36:57|[Liang Henlu] first claimed the title with a knife, then immediately switched from a short knife to a long knife. Qiu Dongyue quickly ran to the left, trying to deceive [Liang Henlu] to the right, diverting his attention.
1:36:57|1:37:8|When Liang Henlu initiated an attack and lifted his long knife, Qiu Dongyue feigned a move to the right to deceive Liang Henlu, causing him to swing to the right. Immediately after, Qiu Dongyue turned around and the tip of the spear narrowly hit the back of Liang Henlu's head.
1:37:9|1:37:29|Liang Henlu hesitated to attack easily after this move, holding the knife diagonally in front of him with the tip aimed at Qiu Dongyue's throat, cautiously maneuvering around him. Seeing Liang Henlu's cautious approach, Qiu Dongyue changed his stance and took the initiative to attack, first feinting a straight-line strike and then immediately shifting sideways.
1:37:30|1:37:48|He constantly shifted sideways, shortening the distance between him and Liang Henlu. When Liang Henlu discovered Qiu Dongyue's trick, he immediately switched his long knife to a short knife. The two of them engaged in a back-and-forth, testing each other's reaction speed and attack distance. After several rounds, neither of them could find the other's weakness.
1:37:50|1:38:7|During the martial arts competition, most of the time they were exchanging moves from a distance. [Qiu Dongyue] displayed agile and versatile footwork, with his body swaying from side to side. Faced with [Qiu Dongyue]'s unpredictable footwork, Liang Henlu remained tense, never daring to relax. In one round, [Qiu Dongyue] kept probing forward continuously.
1:38:8|1:38:16|Liang Henlu quickly shortened the long knife into a short knife, almost swiping towards Qiu Dongyue, but Qiu Dongyue dodged backwards.
1:38:16|1:38:29|After the distance was opened, Liang Henlu switched from a short knife to a long knife. Qie Lang and Zuo Pian Shi on the side couldn't help but sweat for them, their bodies involuntarily moving with their steps. The three sect leaders at the door were also doing the same while watching the battle.
1:38:31|1:38:47|After the mutual probing, the two of them arrived at the high platform under the beam, intending to stop chattering and determine the outcome within one move. Before the final showdown, they made their last efforts to prepare. Liang Henlu used the belt around his waist to generate shaking force, producing two or three sharp knife sounds.
1:38:54|1:39:14|Liang Henlu's skill is clearly profound, as he can quickly transfer his own strength to the tip of the knife, swiftly balancing the enemy. However, [Qiu Dongyue] on the side makes no preparatory movements, effortlessly exerting force and causing his whole body to vibrate together, with his actions appearing effortless.
1:39:14|1:39:23|The dual pistols made a swooshing sound as he exerted force. After both were ready, they stood facing each other, and the formal competition began.
1:40:5|1:40:9|Unexpectedly, [Qiu Dongyue] stopped Liang Henlu with his long knife.
1:40:27|1:40:35|In front of the door, the three sect leaders echoed in agreement, Liang Henlu turned his head and looked at Qiu Dongyue in disbelief.
1:40:51|1:40:56|Liang Henlu looked towards Qiu Dongyue not far away, and Qiu Dongyue nodded firmly at him.
1:41:4|1:41:21|[Qiu Dongyue] threw the knife at [Liang Henlu], who quickly caught it and sheathed it back. He then turned and walked towards the door. Just as he was about to leave, he stopped, turned around, and looked back at [Qiu Dongyue].
1:41:31|1:41:55|Madam Qiu approached the window, not answering her words, just looking into the distance listlessly. Liang Henlu saw that she did not respond, walked alone to another window, and looked in another direction. The two stood on the same side but were separated by the window in the middle. On the bank of the Qinhuai River, three exotic women on a boat were chatting and laughing.
1:42:3|1:42:12|Suddenly, the pirate leader Liu Kai, accompanied by his four soldiers, entered their sight, as several people were conducting routine patrols along the shore.
1:42:35|1:42:55|Upon hearing this, Liu Kai immediately looked towards the direction of the boat. He saw three foreign women walking towards the boat. He quickly pushed aside the soldiers in front of him and rushed towards the boat. The three foreign women pushed out a set of iron armor from the boat, which Liu Kai carefully examined.
1:42:55|1:43:1|While Liu Kai was playing, three exotic women surrounded him, with one woman even pressing closely against his back.
1:43:5|1:43:32|In the performance, a soldier inquires about the whereabouts of [Liu Kai]. After receiving a response, he quickly runs onto the ship and peels off the foreign woman on [Liu Kai]'s back. Upon hearing about the martial arts competition of the four major sects without being informed, [Liu Kai] disregards his iron armor, turns around, and runs towards [Wu Yi] with the soldiers.
1:43:34|1:43:56|They were unaware that [Liang Henlu] had already left, the unintentional martial arts competition had also ended, and [Qiu Dongyue] was preparing to leave the manor with his guns and baggage.
1:43:56|1:44:22|Madam Qiu, holding her neck where she was hit by Liang Henlu, was seen by Qiu Dongyue who simply asked a question. Madam Qiu released her grip on the pillar and walked to where Qiu Dongyue was standing, then stopped. Qiu Dongyue followed him as they walked towards the mansion, with Qiu Dongyue eventually overtaking Madam Qiu along the way.
1:44:42|1:44:56|After a brief exchange, [Liang Henlu] turned around. [Qiu Dongyue] walked up to his side and stood still. Moments later, the two walked forward side by side, neither surpassing the other.
1:45:8|1:45:33|Standing in front of the gate, the two of them stopped. [Qiu Dongyue] reached out his hand towards Madam Qiu, who took the money pouch from her waist that Qiu Dongyue had given her earlier. After a brief exchange, they separated. Seeing that Qiu Dongyue showed no intention of continuing the fight, Madam Qiu put away her stance. Qiu Dongyue stepped over the threshold and stopped.
1:45:36|1:45:54|He fumbled in the sleeve pocket, took out the beard pouch, shook it flat, tidied up the beard on his chin, and put it back into the pouch. In the moment of preparing to tie the rope, he thought of the Russian camp below the cliff.
1:45:54|1:46:2|[Qiu Dongyue] sat on the stone steps in front of the thatched cottage, holding a crying baby in his arms. He gently patted the baby's back, trying to make him stop crying.
1:46:5|1:46:22|Madam Qiu watched Qiu Dongyue, who had stopped in his tracks, not understanding what he was thinking. After a moment of contemplation, Qiu Dongyue once again adjusted his bag, his current attire identical to when he left the mountains and entered the city, carrying two guns and wearing a bamboo hat.
1:46:22|1:46:31|Everything seemed unchanged, yet something seemed different. He walked confidently towards the distance, leaving the concubine's residence and the commercial city behind.
1:46:38|1:47:1|The old concubine stood inside the triple gate, unable to step out, watching as [Qiu Dongyue] left. Along the two horizontal paths after leaving the concubine's residence, she encountered a woman named [Sailan]. She was riding a fast horse, holding a woman in front of her. But at this moment, her heart recalled the encounter with [Madam Qiu] in the concubine's residence.
1:47:10|1:47:19|[Madam Qiu] stood alone by the window of her own attic, staring blankly at the distant street.
1:47:30|1:47:39|Sailan didn't respond, just followed her own chosen destiny, lying happily in Liang Henlu's arms, the evening sun shining on her face.
