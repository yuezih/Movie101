0:0:43|0:0:51|On the bustling street, only one person and one donkey are seen leisurely walking. Suddenly, the donkey becomes unruly, breaking free from the reins and charging forward.
0:0:55|0:1:2|He hopped and skipped in a comical manner, closely following behind the donkey's backside. This scene attracted the attention of passersby who stopped to watch.
0:1:13|0:1:35|Finally, the donkey also got tired and slowed down. The man quickly stretched out his arms to block the donkey's path. He grabbed the reins around the donkey's neck and finally subdued the giant donkey. Before he could finish speaking, the giant donkey started again, wiggling its butt and bouncing away.
0:1:41|0:1:58|The tall buildings and wide roads intertwine, with pedestrians bustling at the entrance of Qinhuangdao Station. The chubby uncle who came to pick someone up is still fast asleep in the car, resting his head on the steering wheel. Obviously, the ringing of the phone has no effect on him at all, occasionally mixed with the sound of snoring.
0:1:58|0:2:8|The woman here is urging the girls on while talking on the phone, followed closely by a group of veterans, led by [Shao Bing].
0:2:36|0:2:44|On the other side, the girls following behind the woman looked around excitedly, but the woman still couldn't get through on the phone. She awkwardly smiled at the girl next to her.
0:2:48|0:2:52|[Zhang Shaobin] is full of spirit, feeling the warmth of returning to his hometown.
0:3:17|0:3:26|The owner of this donkey turns out to be Uncle Two. When [Zhang Shaobin] turns around, he comes face to face with a donkey, and they both look at each other in confusion.
0:5:19|0:5:25|After Uncle Er left, [Zhang Shaobin] looked at the donkey with a surprised expression. At this moment, the woman patted the car door.
0:5:38|0:5:51|In this way, a group of young girls followed the woman and got on the van, looking around curiously. The scenery of the big city made them yearn for it. "Yue Zixin", the leader of the girls, asked.
0:6:12|0:6:14|Upon hearing Sanjie's words, the girls' faces were filled with surprise.
0:6:25|0:6:30|The van gradually drove away, carrying the dreams of a group of young girls. At this moment, inside the police station.
0:6:46|0:6:51|Liu Ming still looked confused. Over here, the sentry placed the backpack on the donkey's back.
0:6:59|0:7:21|Walking further ahead, be careful not to disturb. Yue Zixin just adjusted his posture, took a step, but failed to mount the donkey and ended up falling awkwardly. This scene drew loud laughter from the onlookers. Shaobin sighed as he looked at the donkey, and in desperation, he resorted to a clever trick. He got up from the ground, opened his backpack, and started playing the guitar for the donkey.
0:7:35|0:7:50|This trick actually worked, and the naughty donkey obediently complied. Shaobin mounted the donkey, straightened his military uniform, pulled the reins, and set off on the journey back home.
0:8:57|0:9:12|After the girls all went in, [Yue Zixin] finally dropped the disguise, revealing a sly and cunning expression in the blink of an eye. [Zhang Shaobin] quietly closed the door, and [Yue Zixin] took out a cigarette from her bag, displaying a relaxed attitude as if holding all the winning cards. [Zhang Shaobin] stood next to [Yue Zixin], looking obsequious.
0:9:43|0:9:46|[Zhang Shaobin] covers his ears in a distressed manner.
0:9:57|0:10:1|After [Yue Zixin] finished speaking with a smile, she patted [Zhang Shaobin]'s face.
0:10:20|0:10:23|In the police station, Liu Ming rushed over upon receiving the report.
0:10:51|0:11:5|In the street, while others drive cars, the sentry rides a donkey, attracting the attention of passersby who gather around to take photos. He seems like a triumphant general, waving and thanking the crowd. Just as the sentry reaches the edge of the road, he encounters a red light.
0:11:14|0:11:29|After saying goodbye to the children, he set off on his journey again. Passing by a square dance, [Yue Zixin] was deeply attracted. The security guard was not happy, and he staggered over to him. At this moment, both of them were completely engrossed in watching, completely unaware that someone else was approaching.
0:11:29|0:11:33|The security guard gently patted his shoulder, startling [Yue Zixin].
0:11:43|0:12:0|The old man mumbled to himself, reached out to pat the donkey's head, then turned to look at [Yue Zixin]. Faced with the old man's questioning, [Yue Zixin] was momentarily speechless.
0:12:6|0:12:9|The sign reads, "No pets allowed inside."
0:12:32|0:12:48|He looked flustered, watching people around him pointing and whispering. When he turned around, all he saw were piles of donkey dung, feeling embarrassed and forcing a smile.
0:13:16|0:13:42|He took the receipt and reluctantly took out money from his pocket. Before he could hand over the money, he was directly dragged away by the old man. After straightening his clothes, he nodded in agreement. Shaobin patted the donkey's buttocks, and the donkey rushed forward, instantly knocking the old man into the spotlight.
0:14:1|0:14:19|On the bustling street, cars lined up in a long queue. Yue Zixin led the donkey and continued on the road. In order not to affect the city environment, he racked his brains for solutions. Just then, he coincidentally encountered a shoe insole shop. With a solution in mind, he tied the donkey outside the shop and took a look inside before walking into the insole shop.
0:14:21|0:14:28|In front of a row of shoe cabinets, Yue Zixin carefully selected, trying on several pairs in a row that didn't quite fit. At that moment, the boss walked over.
0:14:46|0:14:54|He clenched his fist, imitating the shape of a donkey's hoof to put on his shoes, with his arms acting as the ground, walking step by step. The boss looked surprised towards the door.
0:15:43|0:16:2|The boss took the money from the sentry impatiently, urging him to leave quickly. Maolu had been waiting outside for a long time, he put on new shoes for the donkey, attracting a crowd of onlookers.
0:16:7|0:16:31|On the side, Yue Zixin reached out to touch the donkey, and the young man wanted to imitate her when he saw it, but the donkey refused. After Zhang Shaobin finished shoeing the donkey, he stood up proudly and clapped his hands. The onlookers either praised or took out their phones to take pictures.
0:16:40|0:16:52|The donkey was fully armed and ready to hit the road, with its hooves wearing cotton shoes, making it quite comical to walk on the road. Passersby all took out their phones to take pictures, while [Zhang Shaobin] warmly waved and greeted them.
0:16:54|0:17:6|Unexpectedly, they encountered the security guard again. [Yue Zixin] saluted while riding a donkey, pointing to the donkey's hooves and rear end. This amused the old man greatly, as it was the first time he had seen a donkey wearing shoes and diapers.
0:17:15|0:17:35|The old man watched the figure walking away in the distance, full of sighs. Along the way, both the donkey and the person were tired and thirsty. [Sentry] found a place to rest the donkey and take a break, and carefully organized for a rest. He caught the mineral water with his hand and fed the donkey with water.
0:17:35|0:17:42|The sentry twisted the bottle cap in his hand, set the water aside, reached out and touched [Yue Zixin], looked at [Zhang Shaobin], and suddenly had an idea.
0:17:49|0:18:8|He held the donkey's face and laughed. The scene shifted, and the Jiaoluo Da tiger was really lively. The sentry was dressed in festive clothes, wearing a big flower on his chest, leading a donkey carrying a beautiful bride, trying to cover his head but getting his arm bitten by the donkey. This time the donkey just wouldn't listen to him.
0:18:19|0:18:37|Zhang Shaobin glanced at his beautiful wife, and they both bent down at the same time. The parents watched the new couple with joy in their hearts. Zhang Shaobin and his new wife faced each other, bowed slightly, but accidentally bumped heads.
0:18:41|0:19:1|He lifted the new bride in his arms and walked into the new room surrounded by everyone. The joyous character "喜" reflected on the side of Yue Zixin's face. The two sat properly on the edge of the bed. Zhang Shaobin slightly turned his head, and through the bride's veil, you could see the shyness on his face. He raised his hand to lift the veil for the bride, but it was unclear whether it was out of shyness or for some other reason.
0:19:3|0:19:20|At this moment, an apple fell from the sky. The two instantly understood the meaning and turned their heads towards each other. The sentinel shifted his somewhat stiff body. The bride lifted her veil slightly, and both of their faces leaned towards the apple. As their breaths drew closer, the apple was moved aside, and the two fell onto the bed smoothly.
0:19:20|0:19:34|The bride then kissed [Zhang Shaobin]'s lips, her face covered in lip prints, pouting in enjoyment. But the next moment, everything was just a dream. In his sleep, [Zhang Shaobin] was still pouting, but the one he was kissing was not the bride, but a donkey.
0:19:34|0:19:45|At this moment, [Zhang Shaobin] was still full of enjoyment, until he opened his eyes and was shocked by the huge donkey face, immediately flipping over and frantically wiping his face with his sleeve.
0:20:4|0:20:18|[Zhang Shaobin] demanded compensation with a donkey, but ended up being punished by a green donkey's face. The atmosphere inside the police station was unexpectedly calm. Liu Ming, with great ambitions, was unable to fulfill them, staring at himself in the mirror with a solemn salute. After the salute, he performed a set of passionate military boxing.
0:20:22|0:20:29|He looked at himself in the mirror, thinking about the unit he was in now, with all his aspirations buried deep in his heart.
0:20:35|0:20:39|On the other side, Yue Zixin's donkey once again showed its stubbornness.
0:21:22|0:21:25|Yue Zixin cried all night holding the rabbit and pig killed by his father.
0:22:1|0:22:9|[Zhang Shaobin] lowered his head to listen to the donkey's opinion. While [Yue Zixin] looked confused, he understood what the donkey meant.
0:22:14|0:22:35|Zhang Shaobin said this and left gracefully, leaving the big brother who stayed in place. After bidding farewell to the big brother, Zhang Shaobin embarked on a new journey, and it was getting late.
0:22:38|0:22:40|He tied the donkey to a pillar in the park.
0:23:12|0:23:14|Zhang Shaobin looked defiant, waiting to see what else they had to say.
0:23:42|0:24:6|When Brother Fa appeared in his sight, it seemed as if the whole world was in a trance. [Zhang Shaobin] gazed at the advancing figure with infatuation in his eyes. He was elegant and extraordinary. With light steps and graceful posture, he walked as if exuding a unique charm and temperament, inspiring awe in others.
0:24:6|0:24:17|[Zhang Shaobin] was still immersed in the shock before him, only to hear Brother Fa gently speak. Brother Fa raised his hand to stop him, and the younger brother immediately fell silent. Brother Fa glanced at the donkey.
0:24:59|0:25:28|Fa Ge waved his hand, as if driving someone away. [Zhang Shaobin] was full of anger, sighed deeply, turned around and was about to leave. Soon, [Zhang Shaobin] was once again driven out of a hotel.
0:25:49|0:26:3|The boss waved his hand, signaling [Zhang Shaobin] to leave quickly. As night fell, he couldn't find a place to stay, so he wandered around with his donkey. Passing by a dilapidated room, [Zhang Shaobin] decided to spend the night there and set off again at daybreak.
0:26:3|0:26:14|The surroundings were filled with barking dogs, the bell on the donkey jingled, and the yard was full of straw. He looked around and gently tied the donkey to a fallen tree trunk nearby.
0:26:38|0:26:55|[Zhang Shaobin], after settling the donkey, walked into the old room. He smoothed out the messy grass and quickly made a simple bed. For [Zhang Shaobin], who had been a soldier, this was nothing difficult. He tidied up the bed in just a few moves. He covered himself with a coat and peacefully drifted off to sleep.
0:26:55|0:27:7|At this time, Zixin, who came to the big city to find a job, had made no progress yet, while the other girls who came at the same time had all found jobs, leaving her puzzled. After some thought, she decided to ask [Shaobin] who was watching TV.
0:27:47|0:27:50|After a slap from the third sister, [Zhang Shaobin] clearly stopped messing around.
0:29:10|0:29:27|[Shahuai] knocked Zixin unconscious with a punch, leaving her lying motionless on the bed. Meanwhile, [Yue Zixin] was fast asleep on a makeshift bed in the grass, completely unaware of what was happening nearby. Suddenly, Zixin woke up. The rest of the money had been transferred.
0:29:37|0:29:44|Listening to the movement outside the room, [Yue Zixin] dared not move, but it seemed like the cunning third sister had discovered something.
0:31:8|0:31:24|After he finished explaining things, he closed the door and left. This silly kid, Yue Zixin, started to act dishonestly again. Hearing Sanjie say she wanted to take a bath, he didn't even look at the account book, just glanced in the direction of Xinxin who was still asleep, and tiptoed out of the room.
0:31:26|0:31:44|[Yue Zixin] saw an opportunity and quietly observed the surroundings until she saw Zhang Shaobin leaving the room in a daze. She got up from the bed gracefully, moving lightly as if afraid of making any noise. Zhang Shaobin was still lost in the act of peeking at his third sister bathing, completely forgetting about the account book.
0:31:44|0:32:6|[Yue Zixin] came to the front room, picked up the account book on the table, and was shocked by its contents. At this moment, the silly Hui leaning on the windowsill knocked over a vase. Startled, he hurried back, only to meet [Yue Zixin] trying to escape. [Yue Zixin] kicked silly Hui, then directly climbed over the wall and onto the roof using a ladder.
0:32:17|0:32:32|Yue Zixin slapped her sister as soon as she arrived, and Shaobin endured the pain and staggered to catch up. She climbed over the wall, anxiously looking at the rooftop, trying to find a way down. But the roof was too high, and a young girl like her couldn't easily jump down, which made Yue Zixin extremely anxious.
0:32:32|0:32:49|Watching the silly gray horse about to reach the roof, [Yue Zixin] felt extremely anxious. In the end, she made up her mind and sat on the edge, sliding down. The little girl was lucky enough to land on a rock. After escaping, the houses outside were lined up, in the pitch-black night where you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.
0:32:49|0:33:0|At this moment, Yue Zixin and Zhang Shaobin also rushed out with a panicked look on their faces. Upon hearing the commotion, Zixin quickly hid, luckily the two sisters did not notice anything unusual.
0:33:1|0:33:15|Directly searching in another direction, the late-night village is filled with gloom and desolation everywhere. Yue Zixin and Zhang Shaobin are like two demons rampaging around, [Yue Zixin] hurriedly running forward, not daring to stop for a moment.
0:33:15|0:33:25|By chance, she arrived at the old house where [Zhang Shaobin] and the donkey were staying temporarily. Afraid of being found by her third sister, she had to find a hiding place first. [Zhang Shaobin] was still inside, dreaming sweet dreams, with a wedding scene playing out.
0:33:26|0:33:40|Yue Zixin and Zhang Shaobin sat facing each other. He blinked hard, trying to see the bride's face clearly, but it was not to be. The more he tried to see the truth, the blurrier it became. He rubbed his eyes and looked at the bride again.
0:33:40|0:33:55|Zhang Shaobin's face still had a lingering smile, only to see Zixin rushing in. In the moment of urgency, she slipped and fell due to the wooden stick under her feet, which happened to hit Shaobin and pinned him down. Shaobin woke up from his dream, thinking that the person on top of him was actually the real bride.
0:33:56|0:34:2|The overlapping of dreams and reality made him momentarily unable to distinguish between truth and falsehood, leaving him in a daze.
0:34:6|0:34:26|Before he could finish speaking, he fainted again. He picked up Zixin and hurried to the hospital. At this time, Sanjie and the others were still searching. Sanjie noticed the bell on the donkey and quickly chased after it. Luckily, [Yue Zixin] cleverly covered the girl with clothes. When they passed by, they found nothing.
0:34:34|0:34:38|The third sister thought what [Zhang Shaobin] said made sense.
0:35:8|0:35:23|On the main road, [Yue Zixin] hurriedly led the girl along, not daring to stop for a moment, afraid that the bad guys would catch up again. Zixin lay drowsily on the donkey's back, reaching out to take out the account book and stuffing it into the donkey's pocket, fearing that something might go wrong again. Inside the van,
0:35:28|0:35:44|The third sister, with Yue Zixin, chased after Shaobin like a dogskin plaster.
0:35:58|0:36:9|He increased the speed of the car, while the sentry on this side hurried along with the donkey. Although he was exhausted and panting, he dared not show the slightest bit of negligence, as they were about to reach the destination soon.
0:36:30|0:36:56|Rescuing the person was the priority, she directly carried the girl and ran inside. Finally, [Yue Zixin] was placed on the hospital bed, and her nervous expression eased slightly. The doctor focused on diagnosing [Yue Zixin]'s brain CT scan, when suddenly, a sentinel appeared behind. At this moment, following the mule, Sanjie and the others also found the hospital entrance.
0:37:1|0:37:10|Yue Zixin and Zhang Shaobin split up, with Yue Zixin looking around the hall but not seeing Zhang Shaobin. When she meets him, she looks flustered and puzzled. They head to the nurse's station.
0:38:32|0:38:36|Yue Zixin and Zhang Shaobin heard the doctor's words. They looked at each other and began to act.
0:39:4|0:39:7|After the doctor left, Yue Zixin couldn't hold it anymore and started laughing hysterically.
0:39:11|0:39:26|Yue Zixin's tone also became gentle, gently patting Shan Hui's head, and they walked out of the hospital lobby together. As they walked out, they saw the donkey in front of them starting to have some crooked thoughts again. They carefully looked around the donkey, but before they could see clearly, the security guard ran out.
0:39:39|0:40:1|Shahui reached out to wipe the donkey's wet diaper, only to find his hand covered in donkey urine. The smell on his hands was self-evident. In a fit of anger, he raised his foot to kick the donkey.
0:40:25|0:40:34|Not long after, the sentry was attracted by the donkey's braying, and he walked over to the donkey, looking it up and down, afraid that the donkey might be injured or uncomfortable in any way.
0:40:47|0:40:50|Zhang Shaobin stuffs the clothes into the pocket of the donkey.
0:40:57|0:40:59|He hurried to the hospital.
0:41:0|0:41:15|After seeing the sentry leave, [Yue Zixin] and Shaohui appeared, finally knowing what the person who took Zixin looked like. With a gesture from [Yue Zixin], Shaohui followed discreetly, even warning the security guard as they left, leaving the poor guard with a puzzled expression on his face.
0:41:16|0:41:34|At the hospital entrance, police officer Liu Ming was heading home after work and happened to ride past. The donkey tied up at the entrance caught his interest instantly, so he parked his bike and walked over to the donkey. With more and more villagers losing their donkeys recently, encountering an unattended donkey late at night, he reached out to inspect the donkey.
0:41:34|0:41:39|The security guard appeared behind him, but he was so focused that he didn't notice at all.
0:41:49|0:41:51|[Liu Ming] was puzzled now.
0:42:19|0:42:24|Upon hearing the security guard's words, [Yue Zixin] sensed something unusual and was drawn by the inexplicable scent emanating from him.
0:42:29|0:42:37|[Liu Ming] also went to the hospital to inquire about the situation. The security guard, after facing the situation all night, sat on the steps, still unable to figure it out in the end.
0:42:37|0:42:55|In the hospital, Zhang Shaobin was followed by Yue Zixin. When he entered the ward, Yue Zixin and Shahuiguiguisui appeared sneakily in the corridor, both looking very tense. Yue Zixin kept looking back from time to time, afraid of being discovered. At the door of the ward, the two of them leaned against the door, looking inside through the glass.
0:43:41|0:43:46|Before Third Sister could finish speaking, a voice came over, scaring the two of them into silence and leaving.
0:43:46|0:43:59|As soon as the doctor pushed open the door and entered, the two of them sneaked back in a furtive manner. They pressed against the wall and quickly arrived at the door of the ward. They positioned themselves and looked inside. At that moment, they happened to encounter [Liu Ming] who came in to check the situation.
0:44:0|0:44:19|Seeing this situation, she immediately became alert, hiding at the end of the corridor, ready to investigate the situation inside. [Zhang Shaobin] was still absorbed in looking at the ward, completely unaware of someone approaching them. The male doctor came over and patted [Zhang Shaobin] on the shoulder, only to be hit in a vital spot by her fist.
0:44:59|0:45:25|[Zhang Shaobin] just whispered to the doctor. The doctor nodded, pushed [Zhang Shaobin] aside and walked towards the ward. Sha Hui heard that the girl had lost her memory and was overjoyed. Sha Hui lowered his head and hurried forward, but was pulled back by [Zhang Shaobin].
0:45:27|0:45:44|In this scene, everything was observed by Liu Ming in the dark. As a police officer, he clearly sensed that there was another conspiracy behind this matter. He looked through the glass into the ward and eventually decided to follow up and take a look. Inside the ward, two doctors were looking at a brain CT scan.
0:45:57|0:46:12|Following that, the male doctor finished his instructions and left. Shaobin thought he was talking about someone else, looking around in confusion. This scene left the doctor feeling dizzy and disoriented.
0:46:38|0:46:48|The doctor didn't say anything more, just turned and left. They were the only ones left in the ward, and [Yue Zixin] quickly spoke up. He grabbed Zhang Shaobin's arm.
0:46:59|0:47:7|Shaobin looked at the arm held by the quilt, then raised his head and carefully examined it for a long time, as if he suddenly figured it out.
0:47:23|0:47:28|Yue Zixin fiddled with the ring on her hand, completely unaware that she was being followed by Zhang Shaobin.
0:47:41|0:47:54|After she finished speaking, she left with Shaohui. Liu Ming emerged from around the corner. As a police officer, she couldn't ignore this matter and secretly decided to investigate further. [Yue Zixin] walked to the gate of the courtyard and saw the security guard sleeping.
0:48:1|0:48:21|Faced with the strong [Yue Zixin], the security guard had to agree first, and then the two of them drove away in a van. After seeing them leave, Liu Ming came to the gate of the courtyard, looked in the direction the van was heading for a while, then turned to look at the donkey. At this moment, the phone rang, and he quickly took out his phone to check.
0:48:35|0:48:55|He couldn't figure it out after thinking for a long time. A donkey actually caused so much trouble. He sat in front of the donkey, staring straight at it. At the police station, Liu Ming was called back by the chief. The chief held a photo of the missing donkey, while Liu Ming stood aside, lost in thought. The man in camouflage clothing didn't seem like a donkey thief.
0:49:12|0:49:19|The sun rose as usual, accompanied by the joyful chirping of birds, and Yue Zixin was discharged from the hospital.
0:49:37|0:49:47|The doctor watched the two figures leaving, shook his head slightly, and turned back to work. Just then, he ran into [Zhang Shaobin] coming out of the hospital. Watching the two of them gradually moving away, he decided to follow them.
0:49:55|0:49:57|Zixin playfully hides on the other side of the donkey.
0:50:14|0:50:32|The security guard, unable to contain his anger, harshly slapped the donkey's buttocks. After the donkey left, he entered the security room with his head tilted, finally able to rest. At this moment, [Zhang Shaobin] also came out pushing his bicycle, his eyes full of questions. In order to uncover the truth, he followed closely behind, carefully riding on the donkey, while the sentry led the donkey away slowly.
0:51:26|0:51:30|Zixin couldn't explain the whole story in just a few words.
0:51:35|0:51:37|He heard [Yue Zixin] say that. Instantly burst into laughter.
0:51:55|0:52:0|Shaobin couldn't hide his joy, [Yue Zixin] tilted her head and thought for a moment.
0:52:10|0:52:16|[Yue Zixin] couldn't stop smiling. A gentle breeze passed by, and both of them had smiles on their faces.
0:52:30|0:52:47|[Yue Zixin]'s heart was cleared of all shadows, enjoying this beautiful moment, with [Zhang Shaobin] behind her seeing everything clearly. At the hospital entrance, the familiar van appeared again. Before the car even stopped, Sanjie inside hurriedly got out.
0:52:47|0:52:51|Yue Zixin then got off the car and rushed straight into the security room.
0:53:16|0:53:24|After realizing she had been tricked, Yue Zixin quickly directed Zhang Shaobin to drive away, and the two left in a hurry. The security guard, dressed lightly and wearing only one shoe, looked very aggrieved.
0:53:28|0:53:36|The more she thought about it, the more something felt wrong. Being bullied for no reason, she didn't even bother to go back and put on clothes, and instead wrote on the signboard at the door.
0:53:39|0:53:45|On the other side, Yue Zixin walked with Zhang Shaobin from the street corner, with Zhang Shaobin riding a bicycle closely behind not far away.
0:53:46|0:54:7|Unexpectedly, a van stood out behind the refugees. At this moment, no one noticed the anomaly behind them, and they continued to move forward. The speed of the car allowed the three sisters to easily catch up with the sentry, then stop the car, roll down the window, and watch the direction the sentry was leaving.
0:54:19|0:54:30|After Shaobin finished speaking, he moved the donkey to the side of the road. [Yue Zixin] took a step and jumped off the donkey. Shaobin tied the donkey to a wooden stake by the roadside.
0:54:36|0:54:49|He patted the donkey's head, signaling it to behave. Then he got up and entered the restaurant with Ziqing. Shaobin pulled out a chair for Ziqing and walked over to sit across from her.
0:55:22|0:55:24|The boss looked embarrassed and asked.
0:55:36|0:55:38|The boss leaned over and shouted.
0:56:2|0:56:8|At this moment, [Zhang Shaobin] also arrived at the restaurant and sat down after confirming that the target person was inside.
0:56:13|0:56:15|[Yue Zixin] gestured in a circular motion as she spoke.
0:56:24|0:56:40|[Zhang Shaobin] finished speaking, and the boss left to take care of other customers. At the door, only saw Sanjie, disguised as an old lady with a bamboo cane, and Sha Hui playing an old couple. Sha Hui opened the door, Sanjie stepped in ahead of him, pushed her old reading glasses, obviously not yet accustomed. Seeing [Yue Zixin] inside, both of their eyes lit up.
0:56:40|0:56:53|The two of them quickly reconciled and found a secluded spot to sit down. [Zhang Shaobin] was attracted by the two of them and turned to look. The leader, without sitting on the stool, kept glancing at [Yue Zixin]'s position and even took the bag to cover her face.
0:57:3|0:57:19|Yue Zixin took the menu handed by the boss, clapped her hands repeatedly to urge him to leave. Impatient, Shaohui patted Yue Zixin. Liu Ming was attracted by their voices.
0:57:36|0:57:47|Upon hearing this clue, [Yue Zixin]'s eyes widened. As soon as this news came out, others started to calculate in their minds. Shaobin nodded in response.
0:57:48|0:57:55|He pointed his head towards the direction of the TV, but when Zixin turned around, she met eyes with Shaobin sitting below the TV.
0:58:9|0:58:14|He quickly got up and fled from the restaurant, while the sentry hurriedly took out money from his pocket and put it on the table before chasing after him.
0:58:16|0:58:30|[Yue Zixin] watched as the prey escaped, then turned to lean against the glass window to see the direction Purple Heart was leaving. The sentry had just run to the door and turned back, taking the donkey with him. Inside the restaurant, [Yue Zixin]'s expression gradually twisted, undoubtedly Silly Gray had been beaten again.
0:58:35|0:58:52|Yue Zixin whispered to Sanjie. Shaohui asked. Sanjie directly scolded and packed up things before leaving with Shaohui. At this moment, [Zhang Shaobin] couldn't sit still anymore, his eyes followed the direction they left, and after they went far away, he quietly followed.
0:58:52|0:59:11|The waves were crashing against the water, forming patches of foam. Only [Yue Zixin] was sitting alone on the shore when Zhang Shaobin walked over with a donkey from a distance. After searching for a while, he finally spotted [Yue Zixin] and walked closer. He tied the donkey to a nearby fence and looked at [Yue Zixin] with concern.
0:59:11|0:59:29|He ran over and squatted in front of [Yue Zixin], asking with concern. Shaobin quickly grabbed one of [Yue Zixin]'s arms and was about to pull her to the hospital.
0:59:43|0:59:55|Faced with the sentry's question, she was at a loss for words for a moment, took a deep breath, and said. She shook her head, her eyes filled with confusion.
1:0:0|1:0:24|Zixin seemed to be suddenly awakened by these words, but upon second thought, her sisters were all called by her, so she couldn't act recklessly at this moment. Seeing Zixin in a dilemma, Shaobin didn't ask any more questions, just quietly sat with her by the seaside, feeling the gentle breeze on their faces. Zixin's sudden words made her feel warm inside.
1:0:29|1:0:32|He patted his chest like a brave knight, with a serious expression.
1:0:42|1:0:46|Shaobin's eyes were full of pity as Yue Zixin reached out and took his arm.
1:1:0|1:1:17|He nodded with a smile, gazing unwaveringly at the man in front of him, feeling a warm flow surging in his heart. His hair danced in the sea breeze, and his heart found rare comfort. He gently leaned his head on the sentinel's shoulder, and the two sat by the seaside rocks, enjoying the sea breeze.
1:1:19|1:1:35|On the road behind, [Zhang Shaobin] watched as the van stopped by the roadside. Sanjie leaned against the van, gazing at the two figures not far away. Sanjie took the cigarette, put it in her mouth, and picked up a lighter from the ground to help light it. She took a deep drag and exhaled a thick cloud of smoke.
1:1:35|1:1:41|At this moment, Yue Zixin, riding a bicycle, hurriedly arrived as well. He glanced at the van and then hid beside a nearby car.
1:1:55|1:2:7|Yue Zixin tried to come up with a solution, but she spotted Liu Ming following them through the rearview mirror, so she quickly turned around to check.
1:2:25|1:2:37|Reluctantly, the two of them had to discuss the matter at length. Seeing the van leaving, Liu Ming also rode his bike to catch up. On the other side, [Zhang Shaobin] led a donkey and took Zixin for a walk by the sea.
1:2:41|1:2:46|Zixin waved to the person inside, only to see a woman getting out of the luxury car, looking at the donkey in surprise.
1:2:53|1:3:0|[Zhang Shaobin] was also shocked to hear this, but Zixin, riding on the donkey, proudly patted the donkey's head.
1:3:19|1:3:26|The supervisor took out a jar of cash directly from the bag. The sentry saw this and tried to take the donkey away.
1:3:48|1:3:59|Madam excitedly mounted the donkey. The sentry led the donkey, carrying Zixin and Madam, strolling leisurely on the road by the sea, with smiles on everyone's faces.
1:4:23|1:4:28|Facing the invitation, [Zhang Shaobin] looked at [Yue Zixin], who nodded repeatedly to confirm [Zhang Shaobin]'s impression.
1:4:33|1:4:51|[Zhang Shaobin] lowered his head and asked the donkey, which nodded in response. Then, she led the donkey towards the direction of the coffee shop. Inside the coffee shop, beautiful music was playing, while [Yue Zixin] was enjoying a delicious piece of cake. A woman then took out water and sprayed it on her face, catching [Yue Zixin]'s curiosity as she watched closely.
1:4:51|1:4:55|Yue Zixin then took out a powder puff and lightly patted it on her face, with graceful movements.
1:5:34|1:5:58|Saying that, he looked out the window, and the van appeared in his sight again. He quickly lowered his head and covered his face. [Zhang Shaobin] noticed the situation and asked. He didn't answer, still keeping his face covered. At this moment, he dropped the utensils in his hand, pushed the chair away, and ran out. The sentry also chased after him.
1:5:59|1:6:19|The two sat quietly by the sea, with the brilliant twilight glow falling on the surface of the sea. The donkey beside them seemed to understand the owner's melancholy, staying quietly. [Yue Zixin] slowly opened her eyes, her gaze dim and heavy, took a deep breath, and said.
1:6:45|1:6:50|His eyes were filled with shock, as if struck by something.
1:7:0|1:7:11|The sentry helped [Yue Zixin] up, patted the sand off her, and led the donkey to set off again. By the roadside, Shaohui searched for a long time but couldn't see any sign of [Yue Zixin].
1:7:45|1:8:0|Yue Zixin and Zhang Shaobin planned to try their luck at Shanhaiguan first. Last time the gate closed, the van started, and they set out on the road to find the death star again. Inside the police station, Liu Ming looked at the photo of the missing donkey and the train of thought for analyzing the case, hoping to find some clues from them.
1:8:2|1:8:25|He seemed to have discovered a clue, casually picked up the map of ideas, circled the word "gang" and marked a question mark next to it. He picked up the drawing, determination shining in his eyes. A meaningful smile played on his lips. As the sky darkened over Shanhaiguan, the moon rose in the night sky, surrounded by the sound of cicadas.
1:8:25|1:8:30|[Zhang Shaobin] is seen with his arms crossed, leaning against the van, his eyes slightly opening.
1:8:40|1:8:48|Shahui pushed the person he caught down the slope, the young man slid down to the bottom of the slope, staggered to Zhang Shaobin, and knelt down with a thud.
1:10:3|1:10:13|In the stone cave, Shaobin and Zixin lit a bonfire here, the fire illuminated the walls of the cave. Shaobin placed the wood in his hand on the fire, and Zixin asked with a smile.
1:11:56|1:12:3|On this quiet night, the sentinel's singing was gentle and soothing. Yue Zixin tried several times, secretly resting her head on his shoulder.
1:12:7|1:12:28|Shaobin trembled slightly, and at that moment, the world seemed to quiet down. He was still murmuring the lyrics in his mouth, but quickly stopped. He raised his arm, gently took the guitar away, and placed it aside, afraid that any slight movement would wake Zixin up. Then he bent his legs, resting his arm on them.
1:12:30|1:12:41|He lowered his head slightly to look at the curled up Yue Zixin, feeling a sense of peace and contentment in his heart. He gently adjusted the coat on her, his movements tender, as if treating a beloved treasure.
1:12:41|1:12:54|He looked down at [Yue Zixin] sleeping peacefully, a faint smile on his lips, unaware that the campfire was casting a golden glow upon them. Zhang Shaobin also drifted off to sleep, ready for the early morning the next day.
1:12:55|1:13:8|At the crow of the rooster, the sun rose on the horizon. In the stone cave, [Yue Zixin] and [Zhang Shaobin] were leaning against the wall, seemingly still asleep. Compared to last night, the campfire had died out, and the donkey nearby was nowhere to be seen.
1:13:8|1:13:17|At this moment, Shaobin slowly woke up from his dream, his eyes squinted slightly, then he yawned and turned to look at [Yue Zixin] beside him, a lingering smile still on his lips.
1:13:19|1:13:44|He then turned to look in the direction of the tied donkey, which was already empty. He turned around to help [Yue Zixin] with her clothes, and immediately got up to look for the donkey. He stumbled on a stone, the loud noise woke up [Yue Zixin], who looked up at the sentry in confusion and asked,
1:13:44|1:13:48|Both of them ran out of the stone cave in a hurry, looking left and right. [Yue Zixin] noticed,
1:14:2|1:14:11|As soon as Zhang Shaobin left, [Yue Zixin] was grabbed by a pair of ruthless hands covering her mouth and dragged away. Meanwhile, Zhang Shaobin was struggling to pull the resisting donkey towards the roaring fire. At this moment, Zhang Shaobin caught up.
1:14:13|1:14:32|Shaobin shouted at him, causing the young man to release the donkey and run away in fear. However, the experienced soldier Shaobin quickly caught up with him and easily subdued the young man from behind. Shaobin heard the commotion and turned around to see the police officer [Zhang Shaobin] arriving with his colleagues.
1:14:48|1:14:59|The soldier just got up when the thief took the opportunity to run away, but luckily another police officer quickly subdued him. [Liu Ming] took out his identification from his pocket.
1:15:37|1:15:39|Then they grabbed that girl and took her away.
1:15:47|1:16:4|Upon hearing the news, the sentry hurried over. Shortly after, [Zhang Shaobin] followed. Inside the abandoned factory, [Yue Zixin] was tied to a large cart, surrounded by dust, garbage, and the stench of decay, making her feel extremely uncomfortable and panicked.
1:16:4|1:16:10|Her hands and feet were tied up and she couldn't move. [Yue Zixin] dodged back and forth in front of them, staring at her with a deadly look.
1:16:23|1:16:44|Zixin shook her head slowly, and [Yue Zixin] once again circled around Zixin. Zixin stared at [Yue Zixin] with a look of resentment, then lowered her eyes and turned her head to the other side.
1:17:4|1:17:14|Shahui held a stick in his hand and was about to strike. At this moment, [Yue Zixin] raised her hand to stop him, glanced at the bound Zixin, and then pulled Shahui aside, saying with a conflicted expression on her face.
1:17:31|1:17:41|Shaobin and Liu Ming arrived in time, with Yue Zixin leading the way, holding a knife to Zixing's neck.
1:17:45|1:17:51|Shaohui rushed forward with a stick, but was quickly subdued by the refugees.
1:18:14|1:18:40|[Yue Zixin] waved her hand, ready to strike. [Zhang Shaobin] raised his hand to push [Yue Zixin] away and took the knife from her hand. Sha Hui kicked Liu Ming away and hit [Zhang Shaobin] with a wooden stick. [Yue Zixin] was tied up, with a look of helplessness and despair in her eyes, calling out her name over and over again.
1:18:42|1:18:49|Yue Zixin gently lifted his head with his hand, and saw him open his eyes.
1:18:53|1:19:10|The police car roared past along the road, accompanied by the sound of sirens, [Yue Zixin] and Zhang Shaobin were quickly taken to the hospital for treatment. Zhang Shaobin sat in the ward for examination, while Liu Ming anxiously waited at the door. [Yue Zixin] sat on a bench in the corridor, head down, with a look of anxiety on her face and a furrowed brow.
1:19:10|1:19:16|At this moment, Zhang Shaobin walked out of the ward and saluted Liu Ming who was standing beside him.
1:20:14|1:20:17|[Yue Zixin] hesitated for a moment, feeling guilty as she lowered her head with a furrowed brow, then spoke.
1:20:49|1:21:1|Shaobin led the donkey with Zixin walking back. Suddenly, Sanjie and Shahuai rushed out from both sides, blocking the donkey directly.
1:21:14|1:21:30|Seeing the situation change, they attempted to turn and run, but how could the police give them a chance? Three police cars surrounded them from different directions, and the police officers quickly got out of the cars and started chasing them. In no time, they had [Yue Zixin] pinned to the ground. On the other side, [Zhang Shaobin] was also successfully captured, falling into the hands of the law.
1:21:32|1:21:46|When the handcuffs were put on, there was no turning back for them. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief seeing the bad guys being captured. The police led the two of them stumbling in front of everyone, with [Yue Zixin] gasping for breath.
1:21:59|1:22:7|[Yue Zixin] and Zhang Shaobin were captured and brought to justice, awaiting the consequences of their mistakes.
1:22:45|1:22:49|Upon hearing these words, [Yue Zixin] blushed and lowered her head.
1:24:24|1:24:53|The two of them went home bickering like that. The next morning, [Zhang Shaobin]'s house was filled with many relatives who came to see the donkey, all lively and bustling together. The donkey's face was covered with a cloth, and [Zhang Shaobin]'s father led the donkey to grind. Even three young men were standing outside the courtyard wall watching the donkey, and [Zhang Shaobin]'s father was laughing uncontrollably.
1:24:57|1:25:19|Shaobin came out with a plate of fresh tofu. He raised his arm, letting Zixin smell the aroma of the tofu. The two playfully teased each other, and this scene happened to be seen by Yue Zixin's mother.
1:25:33|1:25:38|Yue Zixin was puzzled, staring at her mother's back for a long time. Inside the house.
1:26:46|1:26:59|After his parents left, Yue Zixin sat on the bed looking troubled, finally understanding his true feelings. As night fell, the table at Zhang Shaobin's home was filled with delicious dishes.
1:27:29|1:27:43|Shaobin kept serving dishes to [Yue Zixin], and she naturally served him back. The elderly couple looked a bit uncomfortable seeing this scene.
1:27:59|1:28:4|[Yue Zixin]'s smile froze on her face, the atmosphere at the dining table was awkward, tears welled up in her eyes.
1:28:13|1:28:16|He stood there, at a loss for words, unsure of how to explain.
1:28:26|1:28:29|[Yue Zixin] looked at him with tears in her eyes, a smile squeezing out at the corner of her mouth.
1:28:38|1:28:41|He lowered his head, choked up, afraid of being noticed for any abnormality.
1:28:45|1:29:2|Late at night, with the bright moon hanging high in the sky, [Zhang Shaobin] couldn't fall asleep at all. He stood in the courtyard, gazing at the moon above, lost in thought. Then, he lowered his head to look at the donkey in front of him, feeling a sense of helplessness and reluctance in his heart.
1:29:2|1:29:8|He walked over and gently stroked the donkey's face, his parents' actions causing unbearable anxiety in his heart.
1:29:10|1:29:26|He lowered his head slightly and looked at the donkey, as if trying to find an answer from it, and as if reminiscing about the bits and pieces of their past. Inside the new house, [Yue Zixin] curled up in the corner, vividly recalling everything that had happened before.
1:29:42|1:29:51|His lips curled slightly, but when he looked up and saw the character "喜" in front of him, sadness surged back into his heart, recalling the dinner just now.
1:29:57|1:30:13|This sentence is like a thorn, stabbing [Yue Zixin] over and over again. He looked around, staring at the fiery decorations in the new house, feeling a sense of grievance and confusion in his heart. Everything in front of him was so real, with delicate flowers covering the table and the character for "happiness" hanging all over the ceiling.
1:30:13|1:30:21|These moments constantly remind him that there is no room for any fantasies. It's as if he has woken up from a dream, yet is reluctant to leave.
1:30:22|1:30:40|His eyes no longer held the longing and joy of the past, only endless sadness. All that was revealed was an overwhelming grief. His mind kept replaying the voice of [Zhang Shaobin]'s father, tears flowing uncontrollably like a spring from the depths of his soul. Outside the room, [Zhang Shaobin] lingered at the door, yet hesitated to come in.
1:30:40|1:30:46|In the room, [Yue Zixin] seemed to sense his presence, turning her moist cheeks towards the door.
1:30:47|1:31:1|[Zhang Shaobin] raised his arm, the hand about to knock on the door hanging in mid-air. [Yue Zixin] also sat up from the bed, listening intently to the sounds outside the door. The commotion outside made her certain that the person approaching was indeed [Zhang Shaobin].
1:31:1|1:31:12|She leaned against the door, a smile reappearing on her face, waiting for the person she longed for to enter through the door in the next second. [Zhang Shaobin] lingered outside the door for a long time, without taking the next step.
1:31:13|1:31:31|[Yue Zixin] went from initial excitement to disappointment. Leaning against the wall, [Yue Zixin] seemed to have lost control of her emotions. Tears once again streamed down her cheeks, her hands clenched into fists as she cried out in pain. At this moment, both of them were suffering internally, waiting for the other to provide an explanation.
1:31:31|1:31:42|[Yue Zixin] slowly closed her eyes and silently shed tears. Zhang Shaobin, on the other hand, did not understand the deep emotions contained in her tears when she cried - a love that could not be fulfilled, leaving her in unbearable pain.
1:31:43|1:31:53|The sentry outside the door raised his hand several times to knock, but couldn't make up his mind. His expression was anxious, not knowing how to face [Yue Zixin], and not knowing what else to say.
1:31:54|1:32:13|A door stood between the two, a door that represented an inexplicable misunderstanding, becoming a barrier between them. After pondering for a while, Shaobin looked up, his eyes filled with helplessness. Yue Zixin was beautiful, and he knew he was not worthy of her. In the end, he made up his mind and turned away.
1:32:13|1:32:23|Upon hearing the sound of someone leaving outside the door, [Yue Zixin]'s heart, which had been stirred, sank back into the abyss, as cold as frost. Those once beautiful moments now seemed illusory and distant.
1:32:25|1:32:42|The character Yue Zixin felt a surge of sadness like a storm, rushing in and making him feel extremely lost. In the festive new house, he cried with his face up, his hunched body trembling slightly, his delicate face wet with tears.
1:32:42|1:32:54|In the room, [Zhang Shaobin]'s parents waited for a long time, but they didn't see [Zhang Shaobin] coming in to sleep. The elderly couple sat on the edge of the bed, sighing sadly. The lantern by the window swayed with the breeze, destined for a sleepless night.
1:32:57|1:33:3|In the early morning, [Yue Zixin] had already started working. The sentry family was busy grinding beans nearby.
1:35:29|1:35:37|He walked past everyone and approached the donkey.
1:35:41|1:36:5|As she spoke, tears fell uncontrollably from her eyes. She leaned close to the donkey's ear and whispered softly, as if telling [Zhang Shaobin] who was standing nearby. She wiped away the tears on her face, bid farewell, and left. The sentry wanted to chase after her, but was stopped by her mother.
1:36:8|1:36:29|Oh, you... Shaobin stood there dumbfounded, while Second Uncle hurriedly turned and waved goodbye. Watching Zixin's slender figure, he wiped away his tears and ran off, leaving Second Uncle looking even more regretful. Inside the room, [Zhang Shaobin] was leaning against the wooden cabinet lost in thought.
1:36:29|1:36:32|[Zhang Shaobin] showed no intention of getting up, as Auntie Yue arrived at the door of the room.
1:36:38|1:36:42|At this moment, the whole family gathered outside Shaobin's room, and Second Uncle hurriedly asked.
1:37:31|1:37:36|Hearing a familiar voice, [Yue Zixin] suddenly jumped up from the bed and rushed out the door.
1:37:36|1:37:51|At this moment, he couldn't wait any longer, taking big strides towards his resolute heart, a joyful smile on his face as the sunlight sprinkled on his running figure. He could no longer suppress the impulse in his heart, the sprouting of love had already burst forth.
1:37:52|1:38:9|Scenes from the past flashed before his eyes like a movie. He smiled gently, leaning lightly on his shoulder, accompanying him to admire the seaside scenery. These memories made every step of [Yue Zixin] more determined, more believing in his choices.
1:38:9|1:38:15|This time, he finally no longer troubled by the so-called worldly concerns, no longer agonizing over whether he is worthy of the other person.
1:38:16|1:38:37|He ran madly for his beloved one just because he is Zixin, the Zixin on the wall wearing a new dress, has been waiting here for a long time. With a smile on his face, he waits quietly for [Zhang Shaobin] to come to his side. Shaobin runs over panting, the two recognize each other without saying a word.
1:38:37|1:38:40|The sound of panting mixed with joy, tears welled up in the eyes of [Yue Zixin] and [Zhang Shaobin].
1:38:50|1:39:5|Yue Zixin and Zhang Shaobin took a step forward, tears of excitement welling up in their eyes. Just as they were about to embrace, they were blocked by the donkey in the middle, and they both reached out to touch its head.
