0:1:32|0:1:41|As the night deepens, [Ma Shanglai] in tattered clothes chats with a friend via video on the computer screen. The camera slowly pans down as the friend responds.
0:2:30|0:2:43|The scene shifts, and the ringing of the phone inside the house catches the attention of the young man. He stops exercising, walks from the balcony filled with plants into the living room, picks up the phone, and grabs an apple at the same time.
0:2:47|0:2:59|With a swift motion, [Ma Shanglai] put on his shirt, grabbed the keys from the cabinet with his right hand, picked up a long-handled umbrella, and used the curved end to lift the helmet off the coat rack. He then went downstairs, got on his motorcycle, and sped away.
0:3:21|0:3:30|[Ma Shanglai] turned his head to look at the villain, [Ma Shanglai] knocked on the window by the road, and the person inside the house opened the window in alarm, knocking down the villain just in time.
0:3:30|0:3:43|The female victim arrived and kicked the villain fiercely twice. At this moment, a young mother was walking with her baby, completely focused on her phone and unaware of the basketball flying towards her. A figure swiftly passed by, and [Ma Shanglai] who was passing by caught the basketball steadily.
0:3:43|0:3:48|On the zebra crossing, [Ma Shanglai] passing by used a manhole cover from the back of his car to help a blind person passing by.
0:3:49|0:4:3|The scene shifts, with a peaceful street bustling with people. Inside a roadside flat, a couple is arguing. The Quarrel Queen throws a transparent water glass, piercing through the glass and across the street. The words "Ma Shanglai" slowly appear as the camera moves.
0:4:4|0:4:17|The water cup continued to move and burst open next to the man brushing his teeth on the other side of the street. The man was startled, and mouthwash sprayed all over the wall. He turned his head and walked towards the opposite side of the street.
0:4:24|0:4:50|As soon as the words fell, Old Ma rode his motorcycle past, Yupeng took away the wig of the toothbrush man, and he became bald. The bald man closely followed [Ma Shanglai]. The neighbors all gathered around, looking forward to [Ma Shanglai]'s next move.
0:4:57|0:5:20|The wolf [Ma Shanglai] opened the door, then immediately dodged. Boards, brooms, iron pots, one item after another flew out, and the sound of each item landing caused a stir among the neighbors. The wolf [Ma Shanglai] was about to turn back into the house, but unexpectedly a bowl of noodles flew out and landed right on his head, attracting the mocking glances of the onlookers.
0:5:20|0:5:23|With noodles hanging on his face, [Ma Shanglai] slowly turned his head and spoke.
0:5:28|0:5:39|The neighbors burst into laughter at the words, and [Ma Shanglai] also entered the house to mediate. The scene slowly zoomed out and froze, as [Ma Shanglai] walked in from off-screen.
0:5:59|0:6:4|The young couple pushed the door open, and the woman immediately tidied up when she saw the noodles on [Ma Shanglai]'s head.
0:6:17|0:6:40|Ma Shanglai's banter sparked a big fight. The scene shifted to two gangs carrying weapons with fierce expressions walking towards each other. Ma Shanglai squeezed towards the middle. The two groups were intimidated and driven back by Ma Shanglai's momentum.
0:6:56|0:7:8|The two groups immediately started fighting. On the narrow bridge, the two sides engaged in a chaotic battle, with [Ma Shanglai] moving stealthily through the crowd. The fight continued, with both sides using tactics to attack their opponents.
0:7:9|0:7:17|[Ma Shanglai] was pushed to the edge of the bridge by the crowd, and he fell into the water with a flash. The leaders of both sides were in battle, and an old man noticed the drowning [Ma Shanglai].
0:7:27|0:7:43|Ma Shanglai's hat floated on the water, but he was nowhere to be seen. As soon as the boss spoke, he jumped into the water, followed closely by his men, one by one filling the water like dumplings. On the other side, Ma Shanglai relied on his pipe to move forward underwater.
0:8:7|0:8:12|The scene cuts to a woman with her makeup ruined standing on top of a tall building.
0:8:12|0:8:33|36G is a good thing. Just say it now. I used the tactic of luring the tiger out of the mountain. [Ma Shanglai] slowly approaches, scaring the woman. A gun falls from the high building, and [Ma Shanglai] immediately rushes out, grabbing the woman's hand. The two of them hang on the balcony like this.
0:8:33|0:8:38|Downstairs, the onlookers looked up, discussing animatedly, while the firefighters were making urgent rescue preparations.
0:8:40|0:8:48|Amid a series of screams, [Ma Shanglai] finally couldn't hold on any longer and fell from a height of tens of meters along with the woman, only to be caught securely by the safety air cushion.
0:9:6|0:9:12|On the commercial street, a girl in a long dress is not shy about twisting her waist, full of youthful vigor.
0:10:8|0:10:25|[Ma Shanglai] turned and left, with the bald man following closely behind. The young couple on stage danced happily to the music. As night fell, back at home, [Ma Shanglai] prepared a basin of foot-washing water, carried a wooden tub to the balcony, where [Ma Shanglai's Wife] was enjoying the view.
0:10:26|0:10:32|Before they even started, [Ma Shanglai's Wife] exchanged her position with [Ma Shanglai] and began to wash his feet for him.
0:10:36|0:10:43|[Ma Shanglai] immediately understood upon hearing this. He was enjoying a foot washing service from [Ma Shanglai's Wife].
0:11:4|0:11:20|Ma Shanglai's Wife smiled knowingly at the words, walked towards Ma Shanglai, and with a swift kick, Ma Shanglai instantly turned into a braised chicken. The next day,
0:11:31|0:11:35|On the path by the river, [Ma Shanglai's Apprentice] just lifted the signboard with his hands and chased after [Ma Shanglai] speeding on a motorcycle.
0:11:53|0:12:11|In the classroom, Ma Shanglai's Wife is packing up books. Ma Shanglai's Wife looks serious, and Fei Pinxiao understands.
0:12:23|0:12:43|Ma Shanglai's Wife continued to bargain, and Fei Pin stopped his actions, feeling the seriousness of the other party. He continued to probe. Fei Pin seemed to have hit the jackpot, his fingers nervously fidgeting, unable to believe it all.
0:12:47|0:12:54|Ma Shanglai's Wife sent out another pillow.
0:12:59|0:13:18|Ma Shanglai's wife's straightforwardness stunned her son, leaving him at a loss for words. Fei Pinxiao returned home with a full load, laughing all the way back to the tricycle. He sorted through the collected scrap. Inside the house, the mother and son hurriedly ran out in a panic.
0:14:3|0:14:18|The neighbors applauded, the dance team danced every day, and [Ma Shanglai] and his friends took selfies together. Inside the barber shop, [Ma Shanglai]'s son was accompanying his mother to perm her hair. The son held up his phone and said, passing the phone to [Ma Shanglai's Wife].
0:14:28|0:14:55|In the palace, [Ma Shanglai] was about to speak when he was interrupted by a song. The girls in long skirts surrounded [Ma Shanglai] and started dancing, leaving him a bit bewildered. He chuckled to ease the awkwardness and had to go along with the dance performance, while his apprentices below the stage were getting anxious.
0:15:1|0:15:15|The black girl in the audience responded. The fake wife teased [Ma Shanglai] on stage, while [Ma Shanglai's Wife] watched everything from below. The man in a suit responded.
0:15:42|0:15:44|[Mao Xuewang] shows the business license to everyone.
0:15:50|0:15:52|Ma Shanglai's Wife stood up at this moment.
0:16:15|0:16:17|Ma Shanglai's Wife throws away the plaque.
0:17:6|0:17:13|[Mao Xuewang] was furious after watching the video, a charming and graceful woman left the scene with a smile, the camera then shifted to [Ma Shanglai]'s office.
0:18:1|0:18:5|The street director looked disdainfully at the bald man, and the scene shifted to the doorway.
0:18:27|0:18:40|Mao Xuewang angrily said in the car. Inside the luxurious villa, Jiang Bian, dressed in a suit, stood by the French window admiring the scenery. His son, wiping away tears, came down the stairs holding a drone, while Jiang Bian's expression was melancholic.
0:18:42|0:18:51|[Jiang Bian] turned back in response, reaching out to his son. [Ma Shanglai] and his group appeared.
0:20:23|0:20:25|Ma Shanglai's son said helplessly.
0:20:45|0:20:47|Outside the door, [Ma Shanglai] had to continue speaking.
0:21:12|0:21:26|[Ma Shanglai] gradually became serious in tone, feeling as if he had lost his soul after realizing that all his efforts had been wasted. In the parking lot, [Jin Zhen] answered the phone with one hand as he drove away.
0:21:38|0:21:49|A sudden screech of brakes came from the phone. The scene shifted, and two apprentices arrived. [Ma Shanglai] dragged a suitcase along.
0:22:20|0:22:32|Under the persuasion of his apprentice, [Ma Shanglai] finally made up his mind and carefully packed his suitcase. In the underground garage, the fat man lay on the ground, his eyes drifting towards the upper corner.
0:23:13|0:23:15|The fat man's smile quickly disappeared.
0:24:27|0:24:48|In the old [Ma Shanglai's Wife]'s home, his wife is meditating on a chair while their son is doing sit-ups on the floor. The room is eerily quiet. The son breaks the silence by speaking, but the mother remains silent. On the other side, [Ma Shanglai] who just finished a conversation, opens the bedroom door and staggers towards the bathroom.
0:24:50|0:24:53|[Ma Shanglai] was startled and curled up in the corner.
0:25:5|0:25:8|Qingzhen walked out of the bathroom with a face mask on and wrapped in a towel.
0:25:22|0:25:26|The phone rings, and [Jin Zhen] answers the call.
0:25:32|0:25:36|Suddenly, she realized that [Ma Shanglai] was present and immediately hurried into the bedroom.
0:25:58|0:26:5|[Mao Xuewang] looked at [Ma Shanglai], then at [Jin Zhen]. He stormed into the room.
0:26:10|0:26:12|[Ma Shanglai's Wife] sat on the rattan chair, confidently speaking to her son.
0:26:39|0:26:43|[Ma Shanglai] looked at [Mao Xuewang], [Ma Shanglai] stared straight at [Jin Zhen], [Mao Xuewang] advised.
0:27:37|0:27:47|[Ma Shanglai] rides a bike at full speed. [Mao Xuewang] opens the door, while [Ma Shanglai] carries a suitcase from behind him into the house, looking around as he walks.
0:28:20|0:28:37|The night was already deep, with several night lights on in the room. [Ma Shanglai] lay on the leather sofa, trying to fall asleep but constantly being interrupted. He opened his eyes and listened carefully, only to realize that it was [Mao Xuewang]'s snoring, continuously coming from the room.
0:28:37|0:28:43|The penetrating voice made [Ma Shanglai] sit up, and he picked up the pillow next to him and threw it at [Mao Xuewang].
0:28:48|0:29:7|Mao Xuewang was knocked over but still asleep. Fortunately, the snoring stopped. Ma Shanglai then covered him with a blanket and prepared to go back to sleep. However, just as he closed his eyes, a louder snoring sound came, waking up Mao Xuewang this time.
0:29:7|0:29:10|[Mao Xuewang] looked at [Ma Shanglai] and anxiously tapped his own forehead.
0:29:13|0:29:31|The snoring grew louder and louder, [Mao Xuewang] patted his startled heart and was about to lie down. The sudden snoring once again startled [Mao Xuewang], he got up from the bed, staring at [Ma Shanglai] who was snoring loudly, with a very painful expression.
0:29:31|0:29:42|Finally, the continuous snoring broke through Mao Xuewang's defense line, and he couldn't help but gasp in bed. Morning arrived, Ma Shanglai's son rushed to the toilet holding his stomach.
0:30:36|0:30:46|Jiang Bian handed the cue stick to [Ma Shanglai], who stepped forward to catch it, assuming an extremely unorthodox stance and vigorously swinging with his left hand in a backhand motion.
0:30:48|0:30:59|The golf ball flew towards the hole and landed in it steadily. [Ma Shanglai] saw it and jumped for joy. Mr. Jiang looked surprised.
0:32:2|0:32:10|Xiaoli was getting a little impatient. She stirred her coffee cup quickly, and [Mao Xuewang], seeing that communication was impossible, promptly left.
0:32:25|0:32:30|[Ma Shanglai's Wife] scolds her son at home. On the other side.
0:32:43|0:32:49|Gangzi joked. Lulu, feeling offended, started to drive people away.
0:33:5|0:33:14|[Jin Zhen] waved his hand to signal, and Gangzi followed him to leave. Just as Gangzi was about to leave, [Jin Zhen] immediately waved and called for his friend [Lulu].
0:33:31|0:33:36|Outside the company, the secretary pushed the door open and walked towards [Ma Shanglai] and his two apprentices.
0:33:56|0:34:1|The secretary, after listening, looked persistently at [Ma Shanglai] and then turned and left.
0:34:4|0:34:9|On the other side, in [Mao Xuewang]'s luxurious room, fruits and vegetables were flying everywhere, creating a mess.
0:34:26|0:34:55|The couple from the bungalow unexpectedly arrived at [Mao Xuewang]'s house. [Ma Shanglai] blocked him when [Mao Xuewang] tried to open the door. [Mao Xuewang] opened the door, only to see Jia Ling shooting the vase in her hand straight out. Mao Xuewang dodged and caught the vase with his right hand.
0:34:56|0:35:15|He continued to bend down, grabbing the Tang Dynasty tri-colored pottery with his left hand. Little did he know, a larger sculpture was still to come. Mao Xuewang jumped in fright, using his legs to secure the artifact before landing steadily. He looked at himself in disbelief, with Ma Shanglai's Wife also exclaiming in amazement.
0:35:19|0:35:31|As soon as the words fell, a bowl of cold noodles flew out, Mao Xuewang couldn't dodge it and was hit directly on the head by the noodles. He glanced sideways at [Ma Shanglai] with anger in his eyes, and [Ma Shanglai] looked a bit embarrassed, explaining.
0:35:34|0:35:41|[Ma Shanglai] finished speaking and walked into the room, with Mao Xuewang following closely behind him like a wooden puppet, staring at him intently.
0:35:52|0:36:8|Jia Ling laughed after hearing it. Mao Xuewang was about to enter the door when the door suddenly opened, hitting Mao Xuewang outside. With no one around, Ma Shanglai's Wife waved her hand to urge the couple to leave quickly. At this moment, Jia Ling patted his shoulder and said, "Get married soon and go."
0:36:14|0:36:23|Ma Shanglai's Wife was kicked out by Mao Xuewang. Jin Zhen arrived just in time.
0:36:46|0:37:7|[Mao Xuewang] pushed [Ma Shanglai's Wife] aside, grabbed [Ma Shanglai], and then turned and left. Enraged, [Mao Xuewang] kicked [Ma Shanglai]'s luggage with all his might, sending it flying, before returning home to carefully clean up the aftermath. As he looked up, he saw [Ma Shanglai]'s son walking in with a skateboard in his arms.
0:37:17|0:37:38|[Ma Shanglai]'s son turned around. Inside a plastic surgery hospital, [Ma Shanglai] followed [Jin Zhen] to Professor Guo's side, nervously looking around. Professor Guo spoke to [Jin Zhen]. After hearing it, [Jin Zhen] looked at [Ma Shanglai], who then turned and walked towards Professor Guo.
0:37:41|0:37:48|Professor Guo asked incredulously. Then he looked at the approaching Ma Shanglai.
0:38:0|0:38:9|[Ma Shanglai] looked serious and glanced at [Jin Zhen]. [Ma Shanglai] remained silent, which made [Jin Zhen] even happier.
0:38:14|0:38:29|[Jin Zhen] is very shy. Professor Guo waved his hand for [Ma Shanglai] to come closer. [Ma Shanglai] leaned in close to Professor Guo, only to hear him whisper something. [Ma Shanglai] stared at him, while [Jin Zhen] became even shyer after hearing it.
0:38:41|0:38:57|[Jin Zhen] took out a photo, catching Professor Guo's attention. Professor Guo looked at [Jin Zhen], in the room, [Jin Zhen] threw out a photo, it turned out to be the appearance of General Jiang before plastic surgery.
0:39:5|0:39:9|Jiang Bian smirked contemptuously and leaned back slowly on the sofa.
0:39:48|0:39:52|[Ma Shanglai] finished speaking and left with [Jin Zhen].
0:40:11|0:40:29|Outside the parking lot, [Ma Shanglai] and his apprentices are waiting. When the target appears, [Ma Shanglai] starts his performance, and the female secretary walks past him from behind.
0:41:0|0:41:3|The female secretary listened and forcefully closed the car door. [Ma Shanglai] turned and left, inside the luxurious villa.
0:41:27|0:41:35|[Mao Xuewang] kept persuading Xiaoli, whose expression was somewhat sad. She picked up the divorce agreement on the table and made up her mind to sign her name.
0:41:39|0:41:58|The brush glided slowly across the paper, and Xiao Li tossed the agreement aside. [Mao Xuewang] signaled with his eyes for his assistant to quickly collect the agreement, and then a triumphant smile appeared on his face. Just as Xiao Li was about to leave gracefully, suddenly, a beautifully decorated family portrait in front of her caught her attention and made her slow down.
0:42:12|0:42:16|Xiaoli looked at her husband, shook her head disappointedly at her son.
0:42:32|0:42:39|Middle-aged man appears, followed by [Ma Shanglai] and [Jin Zhen]. [Ma Shanglai's Wife] quickly gets up. [Ma Shanglai's Wife] is flustered.
0:42:40|0:42:45|The father raised his hand and delivered a slap. Everyone was shocked.
0:43:3|0:43:5|Jin Zhen pulled the old man to sit down.
0:43:13|0:43:18|[Ma Shanglai] nodded repeatedly. Everyone looked towards the old man.
0:43:23|0:43:29|Everyone was shocked by the speech just now. The old man looked at his crying grandson and continued speaking.
0:43:43|0:43:57|The farce came to an end, and then [Ma Shanglai's Wife] took out a wad of money from the drawer. Mao Xuewang greedily looked at the huge amount of banknotes in front of him, only to see [Ma Shanglai] take out a small bundle and throw it to him, then he collected the money.
0:44:13|0:44:16|Mao Xuewang hesitated to speak. The younger brother looked towards Mao Xuewang. On the other side, Ma Shanglai's Wife was video chatting. The bald man looked somewhat surprised. Ma Shanglai felt a bit scared.
0:44:45|0:44:49|In Mao Xuewang's home, [Jin Zhen] is busy in the kitchen.
0:45:6|0:45:15|[Ma Shanglai] walked to the dining table, picked up [Jin Zhen]'s phone, chuckled lightly after seeing the incoming call information, and Mao Xuewang on the other end of the phone was furious in the car.
0:45:25|0:45:31|Mao Xuewang was startled by Ma Shanglai's voice, and then he picked up the phone and asked.
0:45:37|0:45:58|Mao Xuewang anxiously said. After speaking, [Mao Xuewang] hurried home. He carried flowers and a cake, full of anticipation. He put down the flowers and then looked at the dining table.
0:46:8|0:46:10|Mao Xuewang is very distressed.
0:46:17|0:46:24|Watching [Mao Xuewang] in great pain, [Ma Shanglai] realized the preciousness of the red wine and immediately poured out the remaining liquid. [Mao Xuewang] lunged towards [Ma Shanglai].
0:46:41|0:46:45|Expensive red wine shattered with a sound, Ma Shanglai's Wife sat in a daze in the living room.
0:46:55|0:47:1|[Mao Xuewang] sent a photo of [Ma Shanglai] and [Jin Zhen] to [Ma Shanglai]'s son, and the scene shifted to [Ma Shanglai]'s home.
0:47:3|0:47:20|[Ma Shanglai]'s son peeked out from the toilet. He was taking a bath at this time, and his mother picked up the phone and scrolled through it. Unexpectedly, his face changed when he saw the content. Mao Xuewang sent a photo of [Ma Shanglai] and [Jin Zhen] together, and they looked very sweet in the picture.
0:47:20|0:47:23|In Mao Xuewang's office, Ma Shanglai's Wife stands silently with her hands crossed, seemingly lost in thought.
0:47:31|0:47:56|[Ma Shanglai] son placed the cup on the table, and the scene shifted to Mao Xuewang's house. [Jin Zhen] was busy in the kitchen, with [Ma Shanglai] walking past him. Startled, [Jin Zhen] turned around and quickly explained. [Ma Shanglai] turned his head, and [Jin Zhen] smiled, placing the soup on the table and adding.
0:48:6|0:48:32|[Jin Zhen] was lost in thought. He untied his apron and found [Ma Shanglai] shaving his teeth in front of a mirror, so he immediately approached. As the two were entangled, [Ma Shanglai's Wife] arrived with their son, interrupting their actions. [Ma Shanglai] happily said, "Isn't this bad timing? Mao Xuewang hid behind the door and peeked.
0:48:34|0:48:36|Ma Shanglai's Wife slowly walked towards Jin Zhen.
0:48:48|0:48:50|[Mao Xuewang] covered his head in pain.
0:49:2|0:49:6|He suddenly lifted the tablecloth, then pushed down [Ma Shanglai], and walked away.
0:49:13|0:49:27|[Ma Shanglai] stood up in a hurry. At this moment, [Ma Shanglai's Wife] stared at [Jin Zhen] as if she was about to devour him, but [Jin Zhen] simply picked up his bag and left. [Ma Shanglai] took a few steps to follow, then stopped beside [Ma Shanglai's Wife].
0:49:27|0:49:39|[Mao Xuewang] hurriedly chased out, leaving everyone in the house. [Ma Shanglai's Wife] looked rational, staring at the floor in silence for a long time. Then [Ma Shanglai] asked, and [Ma Shanglai's Wife] could not bear it anymore.
0:49:42|0:49:51|He turned around and pushed [Ma Shanglai] hard, then rushed out the door. Seeing the situation, [Ma Shanglai's Son] immediately chased after him. Suddenly, there was lightning and thunder outside, and heavy rain poured down.
0:50:7|0:50:24|At this moment, [Mao Xuewang] was nowhere to be found, shouting helplessly in the rain. [Ma Shanglai's Wife] ran in the rain, tears mixing with raindrops, with [Ma Shanglai's Son] following closely with a bag in hand. When the drenched [Mao Xuewang] returned home and saw [Ma Shanglai] passed out on the sofa, she was filled with anger.
0:50:55|0:51:1|[Mao Xuewang] forgot he was driving on the road, the sound from the car radio interrupted his thoughts.
0:51:19|0:51:24|In the ruins, only one house remains un-demolished, with a struggling woman with a child at the doorstep.
0:51:52|0:52:1|With the demolition workers raising their hands, an excavator lifted up the shed where the contractor Ma Shanglai was sitting inside. He waved to the women and smugly said.
0:52:6|0:52:17|The woman threw the bamboo pole in her hand towards him. The contractor was hit and fell from the scaffolding. Inside the car, Mao Xuewang handed over the contract.
0:52:27|0:52:38|Chai Qian's tone towards the boss changed, slowly taking off his sunglasses and threatening. [Mao Xuewang] changed his expression, and the scene shifted to the underground parking lot.
0:52:46|0:52:49|The skinny guy, lying on top of [the fat guy], said.
0:53:13|0:53:22|The car owner gave a command, and six strong men walked out of the car. The "Fat Guy" who had been lying on the ground saw the situation was not good and covered his face with his clothes. The skinny guy standing up then spoke.
0:53:28|0:53:41|After speaking, Ma Shanglai's Apprentice started his performance, dancing in front of everyone. He smiled and said, "The strong men kicked the skinny guy to the ground and fiercely hammered their brothers."
0:53:46|0:54:4|The burly man grabbed [Fatty] and threw him onto the hood of the car. As he rolled to the ground and tried to crawl under the car, the skinny man took the opportunity to get into the car. The back door opened, and the skinny man was pulled out, while [Fatty], who was crawling under the car, was blocked. He tried to retreat, but was caught by two burly men.
0:54:4|0:54:12|Soon, the two were firmly trapped by the wheels of the car, enduring punches and kicks from the crowd. In this critical moment, [Ma Shanglai] arrived just in time on his motorcycle.
0:54:13|0:54:18|The burly man was beating everyone up, sizing up [Ma Shanglai], who faced the crowd without any fear.
0:54:26|0:54:46|The car owner pointed at [Ma Shanglai], and the strong man behind him immediately rushed over, throwing punches. [Ma Shanglai] remained calm, dodging each one. Seeing this, the scamming brothers grabbed weapons at hand. [Ma Shanglai] swung his bag and hit the strong man, who couldn't dodge in time and fell to the ground. The scamming brothers were stunned, then threw the bag, and [Ma Shanglai] stepped back with both feet.
0:54:47|0:54:56|With a casual strike to the vital point of the enemy behind him, a leg sweep coming in, [Ma Shanglai] bends down to avoid it, then uses the enemy's back to perform a backflip, followed by a kick to the enemy's vital point.
0:55:18|0:55:26|The crowd scattered and fled. The arrogance they had shown earlier was gone. At this moment, [Ma Shanglai] turned his head to look at the porcelain-bumping brothers hiding in the corner.
0:55:44|0:56:14|[Ma Shanglai] turned his head helplessly and then continued to speak to them. The fat man turned to look at the thin man, as if seeking his opinion. The two men smiled and bowed. [Ma Shanglai] understood the implication of the words. The next day, at the entrance of the residential area, the fat man was wearing a security guard uniform and eating a cucumber, while the thin man stood aside playing with his phone.
0:56:14|0:56:34|The fat man glanced disdainfully at the other person, but when he saw a homeowner entering, he immediately stood up and raised his hand to stop the car. The skinny man also stepped forward and gave a standard salute as the car window rolled down slowly. [Mao Xuewang] stuck his head out, and the two brothers also recognized [Mao Xuewang].
0:57:20|0:57:38|[Ma Shanglai] instructs his apprentices. Then, with a glance, [Mao Xuewang] catches his eye, followed by a skinny guy and a fat guy. Seeing that the person they were trying to persuade has become their opponent, [Ma Shanglai] sneers. [Mao Xuewang] also notices the other side, takes off his sunglasses, and watches as [Ma Shanglai] and his two apprentices approach him.
0:57:53|0:58:7|[Mao Xuewang] looked puzzled, and [Ma Shanglai] realized he had spoken out of turn. He said to [Jin Zhen] and then turned and left. [Lulu] also clenched her fists in warning towards [Mao Xuewang]. In [Sun Erxiang]'s home, [Mao Xuewang] spoke.
0:58:32|0:58:42|The fat guy Yu stabilized his center of gravity. [Ma Shanglai] replied. The sun was setting in the west, in front of [Ma Shanglai's Wife]'s house.
0:58:54|0:58:59|The door opens, and [Ma Shanglai's Wife] is taken aback to see that it's [Jin Zhen] who has come knocking.
0:59:14|0:59:19|[Jin Zhen] finished speaking and turned around, not giving any chance. The old [Ma Shanglai's Wife] muttered under her breath.
0:59:33|0:59:44|Mao Xuewang headed home. Ma Shanglai's son came to inform Ma Shanglai, then turned and left. Ma Shanglai quickly added.
0:59:55|1:0:0|Sun Erxiang's home. Can't stay at home, Mao Xuewang is still trying to persuade.
1:0:4|1:0:13|[Sun Erxiang] ruthlessly threw the bank card on the table, causing [Mao Xuewang] to slowly stand up. He threatened.
1:0:20|1:0:26|[Mao Xuewang] finished speaking and left without looking back. Outside the house, [Ma Shanglai] was picking up steel bars and happened to overhear [Mao Xuewang] chatting.
1:0:28|1:0:52|[Mao Xuewang] looked around and gestured for his younger brother to lower his head. Not far away, [Ma Shanglai] was eavesdropping. After [Mao Xuewang] finished giving instructions, he left, leaving the fat and thin men standing there looking puzzled, exchanging confused glances. On the bridge spanning the river, [Ma Shanglai] rode his motorcycle at high speed.
1:1:9|1:1:24|[Ma Shanglai], who received the message, rushed all the way. As the sky darkened, he suddenly remembered his promise to his wife, so he made a phone call. On the other end of the phone, in the quiet private room full of guests, [Ma Shanglai's Wife] looked at the phone in silence, everyone was waiting for [Ma Shanglai].
1:1:24|1:1:33|But [Ma Shanglai]'s wife did not answer the phone. Her chest was heaving, and intense emotions were brewing. In [Sun Erxiang]'s home, [Ma Shanglai] stood with his apprentice on the balcony.
1:1:38|1:1:50|The scene shifts, two puppet bears appear, they flip through the window and enter, while the third puppet keeps watch outside.
1:1:56|1:2:0|The headgear is removed, revealing [Ma Shanglai's Wife] and [Ma Shanglai's Apprentice].
1:2:2|1:2:19|[Mao Xuewang] did not give the order, so they put on their hoods and headed upstairs. They still had firecrackers tied around their waists, which had been prepared in advance. They laid them on the stairs, and at that moment [Ma Shanglai] also arrived slowly. The "Skinny One" took out a lighter, just as he lit the firecrackers, a long-haired female ghost rushed out from the door on the second floor.
1:2:19|1:2:34|[Ma Shanglai's Wife] and [Ma Shanglai's Apprentice] were startled and tumbled down the stairs. Seeing the situation, [Mao Xuewang] immediately fled. Just as they reached the front door, the ghostly figure of Black Impermanence suddenly appeared, forcing [Ma Shanglai's Wife] and [Ma Shanglai's Apprentice] to turn back.
1:2:34|1:2:44|On the other side, the ghostly figure resembling Bai Wuchang appeared behind [Mao Xuewang], spitting out flames from his mouth like a demon reaping souls in hell. [Mao Xuewang] was chased up to the second floor, colliding with his henchmen.
1:2:46|1:3:1|They had no time to react before a huge log came flying through the air, knocking [Mao Xuewang] and two others, sending them falling into the water pit outside. The successful [Ma Shanglai] and his group rushed over, mocking the drenched chicken-like [Mao Xuewang] on the balcony.
1:3:2|1:3:18|[Mao Xuewang] quickly got up and led his apprentices to escape. The farce came to a temporary end, and [Ma Shanglai] and his group arrived at the balcony, remaining on guard. Inside the house, [Sun Erxiang] was intrigued and opened the window to observe, only to be startled.
1:3:18|1:3:25|[Ma Shanglai] and his group immediately took off their masks, the failed fat and thin duo peeked out, looking into the distance.
1:3:34|1:3:52|The huge launcher fell to the ground with a loud noise. After adjusting the angle, the skinny guy lit the fuse. [Ma Shanglai's Apprentice] was completely unaware, playing a game. The fireworks burst forth, instantly lighting up the sky. Lulu and Jiang Bian were caught off guard, like startled rabbits.
1:3:52|1:4:1|Sun Erxiang was awakened by the explosion, opened the door and looked outside. The sound of fireworks continued, and the lonely house became the only target. Ma Shanglai arrived just in time.
1:4:19|1:4:24|The cannonball was shot with precision. Feng Xiong brothers were hit, leaving only a miserable scream.
1:4:51|1:5:3|[Jin Zhen] rushed over and handed [Ma Shanglai] a vintage-looking pen. [Ma Shanglai] stared at the pen, and the gates of memory quietly opened. He finally recognized the person in front of him as [Jin Zhen].
1:5:17|1:5:20|Seriously injured, the driver fled.
1:5:34|1:5:52|In his memory, [Ma Shanglai] handed a pen to [Jin Zhen]. As the reminiscence slowly fades, [Ma Shanglai] stares at the pen from years ago, then suddenly looks at [Jin Zhen]. [Jin Zhen] remains silent, gazing gently at [Ma Shanglai], the once helpless little girl now grown up.
1:5:59|1:6:14|At night, outside Sun Erxiang's house, Ma Shanglai sits alone on the balcony. He picks up the phone beside him and gently presses a button. On the screen is a family photo of three. Feeling lonely in the house, he regrets not fulfilling the promise he made to his wife.
1:6:14|1:6:26|On the other side, the old [Ma Shanglai's Wife] was also quietly looking out of the window on the balcony at home. On the screen of her phone, there was also a family photo of three people. After looking at the photo for a while, she put away her phone and took a deep breath.
1:6:46|1:7:2|Mao Xuewang waved goodbye, the younger brothers turned and left, bumping into a middle-aged man coming towards them. After watching the younger brothers leave, the middle-aged man walked forward, looked at [Mao Xuewang] in the office, and knocked on the office door.
1:7:47|1:7:51|Sun Erxiang in the palace silently watched Ma Shanglai.
1:8:35|1:8:40|Sun Erxiang opens her heart. Ma Shanglai remains silent.
1:8:50|1:8:53|Ma Shanglai is listening and thinking while at this hotpot restaurant.
1:9:1|1:9:16|At this moment, [Ma Shanglai] became the only listener, sitting on the steps fanning himself. [Sun Erxiang] calmed down and continued speaking.
1:9:20|1:9:35|She opens her heart and voluntarily shares the stories buried deep inside, appearing tough on the outside but also having a gentle side. Facing her deceased husband.
1:9:41|1:10:0|Sun Erxiang's choice is to protect the shared dream of the husband and wife, to keep the hotpot restaurant intact, and not be infringed by anyone. Ma Shanglai turned his head and looked. Looking at the orange tree, Sun Erxiang was amazed.
1:10:9|1:10:14|Sun Erxiang's stubbornness and persistence turned into tears silently streaming down her face.
1:10:21|1:10:38|The next morning, Sun Erxiang strolled in the ruins, the exhaustion of the night had already defeated Ma Shanglai. He was sleeping soundly, and his footsteps did not disturb him at all. Seeing this, Sun Erxiang slowly squatted down. He invited Ma Shanglai to his home and poured him a glass of wine.
1:10:51|1:10:58|[Ma Shanglai] was a little stunned after hearing this, not expecting the other party to make a decision so quickly.
1:11:7|1:11:15|[Sun Erxiang] faces [Ma Shanglai], raising her cup with both hands. After a moment of hesitation, [Ma Shanglai] clinks glasses with her, and it seems like their vows are hidden in this cup of wine.
1:11:27|1:11:43|Soon, [Sun Erxiang] began to move out, holding her husband [Li Yixiang], slowly leaving under the gaze of the demolition workers. [Ma Shanglai] and his group followed behind like bodyguards, while the apprentice [Lulu] helped carry [Sun Erxiang]'s child, and Gangzi held the signboard of the hotpot restaurant.
1:11:43|1:11:59|A group of people had just left when the demolition team hurriedly started working, uprooting the orange tree that [Sun Erxiang] cherished the most. [Ma Shanglai] quickly intervened and with his apprentices, moved the tree to a safe place. Meanwhile, [Mao Xuewang]'s son was demanding his rightful compensation from the boss of the demolition team.
1:12:16|1:12:19|[Mao Xuewang] angrily left and turned to the office.
1:12:38|1:12:40|For the sake of his child, the middle-aged man came to the bank.
1:12:46|1:13:7|[Guoyuan] borrowed a bank card and started to handle the transaction. Inside an internet cafe, the internet-addicted son was battling in front of the computer. Suddenly, he felt very unwell, stopped the game, and started rubbing his forehead. Suddenly, his head slammed straight into the keyboard and fainted. His female companion noticed something was wrong. She helped the man up, and his face was extremely pale.
1:14:5|1:14:9|The fat and thin brothers heard the sound and ran out of the toilet, with their pants still hanging in mid-air.
1:14:42|1:14:54|The phone rings, and [Ma Shanglai's Wife] answers the call. [Mao Xuewang] drives a tanker truck out of a small road, crashes through the roadblock onto the main road. On the other side, [Ma Shanglai] is nervously pacing. The tanker truck races all the way to the city.
1:15:5|1:15:23|[Ma Shanglai] drives a motorcycle to chase after [Mao Xuewang], while inside the car [Mao Xuewang] observes the traffic. The middle-aged man crawls towards the window and fiercely folds it, shattering the glass. The two struggle together, while on the other side, racing to the hospital, [Jin Zhen] remains unconscious, in constant danger.
1:15:25|1:15:41|The struggle inside the oil tanker continues, with the middle-aged man gaining the upper hand and grabbing the steering wheel. On the road, [Ma Shanglai] rides a motorcycle and speeds towards the back of the oil tanker. Sitting in the passenger seat, [Mao Xuewang] tries to grab the steering wheel, but [Ma Shanglai] is overpowered by the middle-aged man.
1:15:44|1:15:56|The speed of the oil tanker did not decrease, and the motorcycle tried every way to keep up. Suddenly, the motorcycle's engine speed sharply increased, quickly coming to the right side of the oil tanker. [Mao Xuewang] on the passenger seat seemed to see a savior, tapping on the window for help.
1:16:4|1:16:16|After Zhongyan finished speaking, he sharply turned the steering wheel to the right, with the motorcycle squeezed behind. [Ma Shanglai] maintained the speed, keeping pace with the oil tanker. Then, he stood up on the motorcycle, leaped forward, and landed at the rear of the oil tanker.
1:16:16|1:16:25|Zhongyan looked into the rearview mirror and realized the camera was off. Then he accidentally stepped on the accelerator, causing [Ma Shanglai] on the roof to lose balance and be thrown out, narrowly escaping a life-threatening situation.
1:16:26|1:16:39|He hooked his hand onto the roof railing to stabilize himself, intending to pull himself up. However, due to the slippery oil tanker and increasing speed, he found himself in danger. After several attempts, he finally made it back onto the roof.
1:16:41|1:16:44|Glancing up at the TV news broadcast.
1:16:58|1:17:8|The scene returns to the oil tanker, with [Ma Shanglai] back on the roof walking towards the front connection. He takes off his helmet and joyfully dives into the driver's cabin, firmly grabbing the door frame with both hands.
1:17:17|1:17:28|Echoes came from behind, [Ma Shanglai] turned his head and saw that the police had arrived.
1:17:44|1:18:8|On the right side of the carriage is a large electronic screen. The promotional vehicle is broadcasting a surgery, with a middle-aged man's son lying on the operating table. The middle-aged man steps on the brake, but the speed of the car does not decrease at all. [Ma Shanglai] flips into the driver's cabin.
1:18:14|1:18:30|Mao [Mao Xuewang] seized the opportunity to move forward and pick up the middle-aged man. Mao Xuewang and the man were safely transferred. Ma had no choice but to continue driving the car as there were no conditions to leave. Fortunately, this was an unfinished bridge and there were no other people on the road.
1:18:53|1:19:16|Everyone ran towards the falling point. Ma Shanglai's life and death were uncertain. Mao Xuewang wanted to take a closer look, but was stopped by the police. Jin Zhen hurried over, looking excited as she watched the oil tanker sinking gradually in the river.
1:19:20|1:19:43|Junzhen could not believe everything in front of her. The support in her heart seemed to collapse at this moment, and the river surface returned to calmness. The fall of the oil tanker only caused a brief ripple. Mao [Xuewang] hung his head in frustration, and the middle-aged man was in tears, full of regret in his eyes. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the water trough by the bridge.
1:19:45|1:19:56|[Ma Shanglai] poked his head out, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. The reporters quickly approached, handing him the microphone to ask questions. [Ma Shanglai] moved with difficulty.
1:20:1|1:20:8|Ma Shanglai's Wife pushes Mao Xuewang away. Lulu holds onto Gangzi beside her, while Ma Shanglai's Wife stays close to the television.
1:20:13|1:20:27|The stone hanging in his heart slowly fell as [Ma Shanglai] was rescued. As night fell, the rescued [Ma Shanglai] walked alone on the street, followed quietly by two skateboarder boys. They passed by [Ma Shanglai] and snatched his bag.
1:20:39|1:20:46|[Ma Shanglai] swung his arms, years of running around to mediate between parties had invisibly strengthened his body.
1:20:46|1:20:59|At this moment, he finally got his reward. The street lights were bright, and he quickly arrived at a downhill slope. [Ma Shanglai] was about to catch up with the other party, but at this moment the gap widened. Using the slope as a skateboard boost, they swiftly slid towards the bottom of the slope.
1:20:59|1:21:7|[Ma Shanglai] continued to pursue, the skateboarder glided past the restaurant on the street, showing off by lifting his crotch bag, catching [Ma Shanglai]'s attention.
1:21:8|1:21:23|Later, they took the escalator and arrived at an open space. [Ma Shanglai], not being young anymore, gradually reached his physical limit and lost sight of the skateboarder. Helplessly, he arrived at the square, only to unexpectedly find [Ma Shanglai's Wife] standing under the Guanyin Bridge.
1:21:23|1:21:36|The drone carrying the cross bag slowly flew towards [Ma Shanglai's Wife]. Suddenly, a beam of light shone on [Ma Shanglai's Wife's] face, time had settled her temperament. At this moment, she was like a ripe fruit, exuding a charming fragrance, leaving [Ma Shanglai] stunned.
1:21:38|1:21:44|Seeing no response from [Ma Shanglai], Jin Zhen turned around with an air of annoyance, ready to leave. At that moment, the large screen above suddenly lit up.
1:23:3|1:23:19|[Ma Shanglai] finally spoke out the words hidden in his heart under the influence of alcohol. His wife, who had misunderstood him all along, now understood his true feelings. As [Ma Shanglai] turned to look at his wife, his eyes were as gentle as water, and his wife looked back at him with a pitiful expression.
1:23:19|1:23:22|On the big screen, the figure of [Mao Xuewang] suddenly appears.
1:23:38|1:23:54|The spotlight slowly came on, and under the Guanyin Bridge, the lights were bright, and everyone surrounded [Ma Shanglai] and his wife dancing square dance. The former mediation subjects also appeared one by one. [Ma Shanglai] was a bit at a loss, but immediately overwhelmed by everyone's enthusiasm, gradually joining the dancing team.
1:23:54|1:24:0|Ma Shanglai's Wife stood aside, quietly watching everything. She wiped away tears and smiled, then joined in.
1:24:1|1:24:16|Joy and laughter filled the square at night, showcasing the lively and outgoing nature of the people of Chongqing. After the incident with the oil tanker, [Mao Xuewang] put aside his previous grudges with [Ma Shanglai], and his heartless attitude towards him from [Jin Zhen] was no longer as cold.
1:24:17|1:24:36|The estranged couple, Mr. and Mrs. Jiang, also brought their son to dance. Their relationship has been repaired by [Ma Shanglai], and they no longer scheme against each other. [Ma Shanglai] seems to be born for Sister Tiao, whom he treats as an art, moving among different groups and always skillfully resolving conflicts.
1:24:40|1:24:52|[Ma Shanglai] seems to have lost his temper due to the conflict with his wife, even though he is a top-notch mediator. Fortunately, he has a group of close friends and trustworthy apprentices to help him save his relationship crisis.
1:24:52|1:24:57|The celebration ended, and [Ma Shanglai] also returned home smoothly. On the table was the notebook of his wife, [Ma Shanglai's Wife].
1:25:9|1:25:13|[Ma Shanglai]'s smile disappeared, looking very disdainfully at the bald man.
