0:0:49|0:0:56|At Yan Zhao Agricultural University, classmates walked into the teaching building together, but the boy ran in the opposite direction and stopped the girls to ask.
0:1:12|0:1:29|At this moment, the girl behind him quietly left. Inside the girls' dormitory, the fixed beds looked neat, and the dormitory was simply yet warm. Everyone was busy packing their luggage. Suddenly, the girl at the innermost bed sat down and sighed.
0:2:9|0:2:19|The girl sitting on the bed opposite seemed to have touched upon [Shan Xing's Dad]'s innermost thoughts with a single sentence. She sat on the edge of the bed holding clothes, lost in thought, staring blankly ahead.
0:3:2|0:3:27|The scene shifts to four years ago, in the peaceful village. A man walks briskly into the courtyard, completely unnoticed by the middle-aged man who is busy repairing a car. [Zhishu] strides ahead, with the middle-aged man following closely behind.
0:4:17|0:4:22|[Zhishu] carefully examined the acceptance letter in his hand and then said confidently.
0:5:4|0:5:13|[Shan Xing's Dad] and [Zhishu] stood in place, watching as [Zhishu] left. Then, [Shan Xing's Dad] looked at his wife beside him, but at this moment, she also didn't know what to do.
0:5:28|0:5:33|The old man dangled his pipe, staring thoughtfully at the back of [Zhishu].
0:5:42|0:6:2|[Shan Xing]'s home, [Shan Xing] is walking into the courtyard with a hoe. As she walks, she wipes the sweat off her forehead. Seeing water in the tub, she bends down to scoop it up. Busy all day, she doesn't even have time to put down the hoe. With one hand holding the ladle, she starts drinking. After quenching her thirst, she finally walks to the corner of the wall, puts down the hoe, and shouts towards the inner room.
0:6:3|0:6:7|Hearing her daughter's call, the mother walked towards the table expressionlessly.
0:6:8|0:6:18|He ignored [Shan Xing] standing in front of him, picked up the admission letter on the table and handed it to [Shan Xing]. His father sat on a nearby chair, propping up his head with one hand, staring intently at the ground.
0:6:18|0:6:25|But when [Shan Xing] took the acceptance letter and read it carefully, [Shan Xing's Mom] turned her head to the side, unsure of how to face this matter.
0:6:26|0:6:42|Upon seeing her acceptance letter, [Shan Xing] showed a joyful expression. However, as she continued reading, she was shocked to find out that the tuition fee for enrollment was as high as 6500 yuan. Her face instantly froze in disbelief as she stared intently at the acceptance letter.
0:6:42|0:7:15|Shortly after, she put the admission letter back on the table and walked out. Standing at the door, she suppressed her unwillingness, staring blankly ahead. Then, she walked out the door with heavy steps. Facing the silence of her parents, she deeply understood the pain within. Unconsciously, she found herself on the bridge.
0:7:44|0:7:52|Perhaps some people already know that when [Zhishu] spoke, everyone present silently bowed their heads.
0:9:3|0:9:10|Zhishu warned everyone on the street, and the woman beside him quickly covered her mouth and nose, afraid that she might cry out loud.
0:10:11|0:10:28|Speak up, everyone can go their separate ways. On the other side, [Shan Xing] sat alone at the desk, staring fixedly at the tabletop. Meanwhile, the neighbors were turning off their lights and resting. Although her mother had gone to bed early, she stayed awake all night, her mind filled with thoughts of what had happened during the day.
0:10:32|0:10:40|She increasingly couldn't control her emotions and could only turn her body inward. At the same time, next door, [Shan Xing] was already in tears.
0:10:41|0:10:44|He stared intently at the neatly arranged money on the table.
0:11:23|0:11:37|The money is arranged from small to large, with a shot of his acceptance letter placed in front of him. This is his only chance, a series of tears silently stream down his sorrowful face, without a sound of crying, just letting the tears flow continuously.
0:11:37|0:11:45|Unknowingly, he fell asleep on the table, tears streaking his cheeks. The next morning, Xier, heading out.
0:12:12|0:12:19|The young man from the same village stared intently at the door of [Shan Xing]'s house, while walking ahead and tidying his clothes, the girl followed quietly behind him.
0:12:34|0:12:37|See [Shan Xing] open the door, and the person outside immediately walks up.
0:12:53|0:13:2|Everyone walked towards the village entrance together, unaware that the villagers were already waiting there. Upon seeing [Shan Xing], people of all ages stood up one after another to bid farewell.
0:13:17|0:13:24|After speaking, Xiaoduo's eyes were filled with tears as she reluctantly stepped back, while [Shan Xing] continued to move forward under the crowd's escort.
0:14:8|0:14:15|[Shan Xing] held the food in her hands, feeling grateful. She looked at the villagers standing halfway up the mountain.
0:14:27|0:14:39|With a deep bow from [Shan Xing], the villagers waved goodbye to him. At the same time, Xiaoduo packed the full cloth bags into the Sonali. As the Sonali started, the air was filled with the sense of farewell.
0:15:38|0:15:55|After listening, [Shan Xing] looked at the ticket collector in shock, then he pretended to be calm and took out some change from his pocket. But looking at the money the villagers had painstakingly put together, he couldn't bear to spend it. He casually folded up Lv Shun's money again, tightly held it in his hand, put the money back in his pocket, and looked at the driver.
0:16:17|0:16:29|After getting off the car, a speeding car passed by. She picked up her heavy school bag again and lifted the luggage in her right hand. Although the school bag was heavy and the journey was long, compared to [Shan Xing]'s future, this was nothing at all.
0:16:48|0:16:56|Suddenly, someone outside the window shouted. Zhishu's Dad quickly returned from the balcony to inform him.
0:16:58|0:17:13|[Shan Xing] listened and quickly put down the clothes in his hands, got up and went downstairs to the appointment. When he saw [Zhishu], he quickened his pace and walked up to him, while [Zhishu] was quietly waiting on the garden path, with something hidden behind his back.
0:17:18|0:17:20|[Shan Xing] took a closer look and found it was actually an employment contract.
0:18:36|0:18:47|[Shan Xing] took the phone in disbelief and looked at [Zhishu] in confusion. But at that moment, [Zhishu] lowered his head shyly, knowing [Shan Xing]'s dilemma and not wanting to trouble him further.
0:19:20|0:19:33|[Wu Yiliang] may be reluctant to part with [Shan Xing], but he cannot stop her from doing what she wants. After they bid farewell, [Shan Xing] embarked on the journey back home, this time choosing to take the bus.
0:19:33|0:19:43|He stood by the window, looking at the passing scenery, feeling a mix of emotions. The car wound its way up the steep mountain road, and at the mountaintop, he saw many apricot blossoms in full bloom on the branches.
0:19:44|0:20:6|Tan Zhiyi returned to the street, and as the bus approached the village entrance, the driver stopped the bus. [Shan Xing] immediately got off the bus and, seeing everything familiar, he was filled with emotion. He quickly walked to the side of the small road, observing the changes around him. Just then, Xiao Duo, who was pedaling a bicycle behind the bus, recognized him and quickly stopped to greet him.
0:21:53|0:21:58|After speaking, [Shan Xing] looked worried, furrowing his brow and gazing elsewhere.
0:22:16|0:22:25|Xiaoduo helped [Shan Xing] carry the luggage on a bicycle as they walked towards the village together. Later, [Shan Xing] pushed open the door of her home and looked at [Shan Xing's Mom] sitting by the kang.
0:23:50|0:23:54|[Shan Xing] looked at [Shan Xing's Mom], who was working so hard, with tears in her eyes.
0:26:39|0:26:54|Faced with the selfless dedication of his family, [Shan Xing] was full of heartache. He looked helplessly at [Shan Xing's Dad] resting by the kang, silently vowing to ensure a better life for his family. In the evening, the whole family gathered on the kang to enjoy a reunion dinner.
0:28:21|0:28:24|The next morning, [Shan Xing] got up early to help her mother tidy up the house.
0:29:0|0:29:16|Upon hearing this, [Shan Xing] immediately felt a sense of crisis, and then he came up with a good solution. On the other hand, [Zhishu] was also struggling with the matter.
0:32:41|0:32:55|After speaking, [Shan Xing] ran towards the bicycle parked in the courtyard, pushed the bike and started to ride out. His eyes were fixed ahead, his feet alternately pushing the pedals hard, the bicycle getting faster and faster, the wind whistling in his ears.
0:32:56|0:33:11|The country road was still bumpy with hard gravel, and the uneven surface made [Shan Xing] involuntarily tighten her grip on the handlebars. Two little girls happily walked hand in hand, not at all disturbed by the car speeding past [Shan Xing].
0:33:11|0:33:22|As dusk approached, [Shan Xing] finally arrived at the Fuyangzhai restaurant in the county. He hurriedly parked his bicycle at the entrance and then ran inside. He stood in the lobby, looking around in confusion.
0:34:13|0:34:19|In the private room, the secretary poured wine for [Zhishu] and the village chief, while Manager Zhang took the opportunity to bring out the prepared herbal tea and cash.
0:34:51|0:35:0|At the same time, [Shan Xing] peered through the crack in the door and saw everything that was happening.
0:37:53|0:38:2|Zhishu, tell me, Manager Zhang has once again placed a pile of cash in front of [Zhishu]. At this moment, [Shan Xing's Dad] has already disguised himself as a waiter outside the door, leaning against the door crack, listening to their conversation.
0:41:32|0:41:47|[Shan Xing] immediately stood up, picked up the cash next to [Zhishu], and held the thirty thousand yuan in his hand, shining it left and right. The next second, he looked suspiciously at the village chief, and at Manager Zhang's eager look. He smirked sarcastically and decisively began to execute his plan.
0:43:19|0:43:35|[Shan Xing] placed the contract in front of Manager Zhang, watched him press his fingerprint, then turned to look at the village chief beside him. Seeing them all finish pressing their fingerprints, [Shan Xing] picked up the contract satisfactorily, looked at it, and sighed with a smile.
0:44:11|0:44:16|Ji Shu pretended to cry and reminded them, and the village head stood up belatedly.
0:44:18|0:44:27|Let's trick this little ghost girl. [Shan Xing] quickly ran out of the restaurant, headed straight for the bicycle at the door, and without looking back, rode off on the bicycle.
0:44:35|0:44:54|At this moment, as the sky darkens, [Shan Xing] accelerates on his bike along the mountain road. Everything around him seems to want to swallow him up, with endless darkness ahead. He dares not even take a deep breath, his heart racing in his throat, sweat dripping from his forehead. Suddenly, he faintly hears the long-lost sound of a suona coming from up ahead.
0:45:35|0:45:44|Later, [Shan Xing] got on the car, with Xiaoduo following closely behind, seizing the opportunity to sit steadily in the seat. The next day, [Shan Xing] was seen decorating the blackboard at the village entrance.
0:48:58|0:49:15|[Shan Xing] turned around with a book in hand, skillfully writing on the blackboard with chalk, while [Zhishu] maintained order on the side. Villagers sat below, attentively listening. Back at home, [Shan Xing] quietly toiled away in her family's warehouse. She inserted apricot branches into different bottles, observing their changes.
0:49:15|0:49:19|The mother brought dinner to her with a look of concern on her face.
0:49:42|0:50:0|After her mother passed away, [Shan Xing] picked up the bottle next to her and observed the apricot tree branches inside. On the slender trunk, there were only a few sparse leaves. She scrutinized the development of the branches from left to right, propping up her chin with one hand, furrowing her brow. The next morning, [Shan Xing] was already in the apricot orchard with a magnifying glass, observing the budding of the apricot trees.
0:50:0|0:50:6|[Ma Dongmei] is responsible for recording data on the side.
0:50:13|0:50:17|Just then, [Wu Yiliang] suddenly appeared behind him.
0:51:25|0:51:37|Hey, Zhishu, don't underestimate Shan Xing's Mom. Who knows, one day, hmph. Shan Xing's Mom heard this and angrily turned and walked away.
0:52:36|0:52:44|[Wu Yiliang] lowered his head in embarrassment, then [Shan Xing's Mom] and Xiaomei pushed the millstone together to grind beans at the doorstep.
0:53:19|0:53:22|Although it has a certain effect on preserving the freshness of the extended crab.
0:54:38|0:54:42|The two of them walked and chatted, unconsciously walking to the riverside.
0:55:55|0:56:3|Upon returning to the village, Zhishu and Shan Xing's Dad enjoyed another bountiful harvest after a few years.
0:57:8|0:57:20|[Zhishu] stood still and sighed deeply after [Shan Xing's Mom] left. Although he supported [Shan Xing's Mom]'s decision, he also worried about her. Later, [Zhishu] led [Shan Xing] to hold a meeting to mobilize the construction of the road.
0:59:9|0:59:35|Zhishu casually took out a cigarette from the side of his clothes, lit it, flipped the cigarette box up, then smelled the cigarette at the pen, and looked at the mountain path, saying. Zhishu helplessly put the cigarette back into the box.
0:59:48|0:59:52|[Zhishu] had just walked out of the shed when he was stopped at the door by the villagers questioning him.
1:0:41|1:0:54|Xuanxin looked at the hands of the villagers covered in scars, he tightly furrowed his brows, holding back tears, and said with a guilty look.
1:1:8|1:1:22|After the villagers left, [Shan Xing] lowered her head in shame, the successive blows causing her to deeply doubt herself. Seeing [Shan Xing] return, [Shan Xing's Mom] walked up to her to show concern.
1:1:40|1:1:43|[Shan Xing] picked up the water glass on the table and drank it down in one gulp.
1:2:25|1:2:31|The mother watched her daughter toil day and night, her eyes full of heartache, then she reluctantly turned and left.
1:2:31|1:2:45|[Shan Xing] looked at the back of his mother and suddenly felt a wave of sadness. The light reflected the frail body of his mother, and the years had left deep marks on her face. Thinking about his own situation, he felt sorry for them and was afraid of letting them down.
1:3:43|1:4:1|Shan Xing's Mom stepped on empty space and fell down the hill. Meanwhile, Shan Xing was having a meeting with the village committee in the shed.
1:5:33|1:5:50|The boy was just running out when he was knocked down by [Wu Yiliang], who came to visit [Shan Xing]. Ignoring his own injuries, he quickly got up to find [Shan Xing]. Seeing no one at Zhu's house, he quickly ran to the original house. At the same time, they quickly lifted [Shan Xing's Mom] and prepared to take her to the hospital.
1:5:58|1:6:6|At this moment, [Shan Xing] is still in the shed attending a meeting, unaware of what has happened at home.
1:7:41|1:7:46|Zhishu saw the firm attitude of [Shan Xing] and furrowed his brows, sinking into contemplation.
1:8:8|1:8:30|[Shan Xing] rushed home without asking questions. At the same time, neighbors carried [Shan Xing's Mom] to the village entrance. Shortly after everyone left the village, [Shan Xing] ran back, shouting for her mother as soon as she pushed open the door, but received no response, her voice echoing through the entire courtyard.
1:8:34|1:8:45|She pushed open the door and looked around, but [Shan Xing's Mom] was nowhere to be seen. The empty room made her regretful, and suddenly she noticed a missing door, instantly realizing the seriousness of the situation.
1:9:1|1:9:7|Running quickly on a narrow path, the surface of the road is uneven, paved with stones of different sizes.
1:9:13|1:9:35|Shan Xing's Mom, who is in a coma, keeps calling out Shan Xing's name. Shan Xing is rushing over with all her might. Halfway there, Shan Xing trips over a stone. Despite the pain, she gets up and continues running.
1:9:35|1:9:41|[Shan Xing's Mom] furrowed her brows, nodded slightly, and her brother quickly looked towards the small path behind, trying to find his sister's figure.
1:9:48|1:9:52|[Shan Xing's Mom] slowly lifted her head to look at her husband, who quickly comforted her.
1:10:17|1:10:21|The younger brother intended to catch the thumbs-up gesture from [Shan Xing's Mom], but ended up grabbing nothing.
1:10:59|1:11:2|Suddenly, [Shan Xing] was tripped by a stone, tears welling up in her eyes as she crawled towards [Shan Xing's Mom].
1:12:39|1:12:52|Since [Shan Xing's Mom] left, the house became empty and deserted. The low-roofed tile house was devoid of sunlight for a long time, dim and damp. The damaged walls became uneven, neglected and unattended, allowing free roaming inside the house.
1:12:52|1:12:58|On the other side, [Wu Yiliang] held the apricot blossoms in his hands and slowly approached the grave of [Shan Xing's Mom], kneeling down to brush away the dust on the tombstone.
1:12:59|1:13:17|Afterwards, as the apricot blossoms were set down, at the same time, the nearby [Shan Xing] tree swayed in the wind, petals fluttering in the air. One by one, the petals spun and drifted down from the sky, resembling a butterfly floating, unexpectedly coming towards him. He stared at the tombstone, slowly stood up, carrying a heavy heart, and lowered his head.
1:13:18|1:13:33|[Wu Yiliang] never expected that such an unfortunate incident would happen during his first visit to [Shan Xing's Dad]. He sighed deeply, feeling sorry for [Shan Xing]. Then, with a helpless expression, he turned and left. [Shan Xing], who was hiding nearby, saw everything he had done.
1:13:34|1:13:46|Looking at his lonely figure, my heart was in turmoil. [Zhishu] had been silently giving his all from behind, but he didn't have the courage to respond to this matter. A few days later, the village committee posted a notice, which read:
1:15:12|1:15:23|The members of the Central Pavilion team, dressed in deliberately colorful silk, lined up in neat formation, stepping lightly to the drumbeat, skillfully and methodically leading the way, the entire square enveloped in a cheerful atmosphere.
1:15:23|1:15:34|As more and more people gathered to watch, Zhishu's team began to reach one climax after another, with Shan Xing's Dad blowing the horn sauce with all his might, and the people from Zhishu's team were letting loose without any constraints.
1:15:48|1:15:54|At this moment, the villagers had already crowded in front of the village committee.
1:17:28|1:17:49|Day after day, year after year, the faces of the farmers gradually become thin, with calluses clearly visible on their hands. No matter how difficult the conditions are, the farmers will persist in their labor, as only through labor can they stay away from poverty, with better days just around the corner.
1:18:54|1:19:2|On this day, a luxury car drove towards Xinghua Gou Village, with the big boss sitting in the back seat looking around at the surroundings.
1:19:15|1:19:33|Unconsciously, the luxury car has arrived at the entrance of Xinghua Gou Village. Due to the lack of a cement road leading into the village, the car was moving very slowly until it came to a steady stop, and then the big boss got out of the car. The driver did not get out of the car at this time, but instead opened the window, waiting quietly for the big boss's instructions.
1:19:41|1:19:44|The boss walked along a small path and unexpectedly entered the apricot forest.
1:21:14|1:21:18|[Shan Xing] then turned his head to the side and after a moment of thought, said.
1:22:45|1:23:0|The two sisters smiled at each other, their long efforts finally paying off. From a distance, the apricot forest looked like an ocean of flowers, with clusters of apricot blossoms dazzling the eyes. Holding hands, they played in the apricot grove, both unable to contain their emotions.
1:23:41|1:23:51|[Shan Xing's Mom] pulled Xiaomei towards the side of the apricot tree, where every branch was covered with clusters of flowers. She casually picked one and placed it on Xiaomei's head.
1:24:1|1:24:10|Immediately, she turned around and picked a flower, joyfully putting it on [Shan Xing's Mom]. At the same time, [Shan Xing] looked at her and shook her head.
1:24:26|1:24:31|As night fell, the two sisters quickly ran down the hill, followed by the sound of children playing games.
1:25:19|1:25:26|The children facing each other are laughing happily, while on the other side, [Shan Xing] is quickly caught up by Xiao Mei, panting as she chases after her.
1:25:39|1:25:53|Xiaomei hurriedly ran up the hill, hoping for [Shan Xing] to catch up, but at this moment, [Shan Xing] fell while climbing the slope. She staggered up the hill, struggled to stand up, suddenly feeling dizzy and disoriented, everything around her becoming blurry, losing her sense of direction.
1:25:53|1:26:2|In a dizzying moment, she almost stumbled and touched her forehead, looking up at the sky. The trees in front of her kept spinning, even creating multiple images.
1:26:3|1:26:20|The mind is like a stagnant pool in the dark night, with no ripples, everything around seems unrelated to her, like a rotten wood falling down. At the same time, Shan Xing's Dad, who was running ahead, suddenly stopped, clutching his chest, gasping for breath.
1:26:20|1:26:25|When she heard no sound behind her, she turned around and shouted with a worried look on her face.
1:26:44|1:26:59|The villagers hurried to the apricot forest, and together they loaded Shan Xing onto the van, which then sped down the road at the fastest speed.
1:26:59|1:27:13|At this moment, [Shan Xing] looked haggard, with pale lips, lying weakly in Xiaomei's arms. His father and brother sat on either side, frowning anxiously and calling out to [Shan Xing], afraid that he might fall asleep. The driver could only rush to the destination at the fastest speed.
1:28:22|1:28:31|[Zhishu] comforted [Shan Xing] with a smile, although feeling heartbroken inside. He covered [Shan Xing]'s hand with a blanket, and at the same time, [Wu Yiliang] rushed over upon hearing the news.
1:28:45|1:28:47|The two finally let go of the burden in their hearts.
1:29:31|1:29:47|[Wu Yiliang] frowned. Regretting his past decisions, he nodded repeatedly, holding back tears as he looked at [Shan Xing].
1:29:51|1:30:5|[Shan Xing] withdrew her gaze in disappointment, while Shan Xing's Dad, who was standing beside her, glared angrily at Wu Yiliang. Seeing Shan Xing about to lie down, he quickly supported her head and helped her into a comfortable position. Wu Yiliang, seeing this, stood up and prepared to leave.
1:30:5|1:30:16|In front of the door, he reluctantly looked back at [Shan Xing], but she did not try to stop him, turning her head to the other side instead. It wasn't until he heard the door closing that he looked towards the entrance.
1:30:20|1:30:34|The gap between the two is significant and not something that can be bridged in a short time. Wu Yiliang, with one hand in his pocket, walked away from the hospital with a slightly desolate figure, without looking back.
1:31:6|1:31:16|Hearing Xiaomei's answer, [Shan Xing's Dad] nodded in satisfaction. He knew Xiaomei was a good girl and hoped she could be happy. Meanwhile, [Zhishu] arrived at the forest where Shan Xing was.
1:32:6|1:32:21|He leaned against the [Shan Xing] tree with one hand, furrowing his brow, looking at everything in front of him. Remembering [Shan Xing's Dad]'s words, he felt even more heartbroken, leaning his head against the tree trunk and crying. In the hospital, [Zhishu] brought [Xinghua] to visit [Shan Xing's Dad]. [Zhishu] walked slowly towards him, and [Shan Xing's Dad] looked at him and spoke.
1:32:27|1:32:32|[Shan Xing's Dad] sat up with the help of [Xiao Duo] and [Xiao Mei], then [Xiao Duo] sat beside him.
1:34:27|1:34:43|It was the subtle gesture of [Ma Dongmei] that completely touched the tender heart beneath [Shan Xing's Dad]'s tough exterior. The two shed tears and gazed deeply at each other. Then, [Ma Dongmei] placed the [apricot flowers] in [Shan Xing's Dad]'s hands. [Shan Xing's Dad] smiled with relief, finally understanding her own heart at that moment.
1:34:48|1:35:6|[Shan Xing's Dad] repeatedly thanked [Zhishu], leaving [Ma Dongmei] feeling a bit overwhelmed. She raised her hand to wipe away the tears, then looked at [Shan Xing's Dad] lying on the hospital bed with a heart full of pity. The next day, Ma Dongmei blew the zurna under the bridge at the village entrance, her voice clear and loud, with a penetrating power that could be heard throughout the surrounding villages.
1:35:6|1:35:11|Shortly after, [Shan Xing] was seen riding a bicycle with Xiao Duo towards the village.
