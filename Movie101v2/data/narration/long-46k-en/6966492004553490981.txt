0:1:27|0:1:54|In the year 2000, an auction was taking place at a British auction house. The bronze heads of the zodiac animals, including [Ox Head], [Monkey Head], [Tiger Head], and [Pig Head], were sold at high prices of over 7 million, over 8 million, over 15 million, and over 6 million dollars respectively.
0:2:5|0:2:17|The scene cuts to a living room, where an elderly man with white hair is sitting in a wheelchair, surrounded by three bodyguards attending to him. [Simon] and [Coco] are observing the bronze statue of a dog's head on the side.
0:3:18|0:3:25|Mr. Morgan tore up three stamps.
0:4:50|0:5:2|A sports car pulled up to the entrance of a military base, and the soldier on duty immediately picked up his gun and walked over. The beautiful henchwoman [Bonnie] stepped out of the car in high heels.
0:5:21|0:5:40|Observing the soldiers around with sunglasses, she quietly sneaked up to a room door covered with keys, while the soldiers outside remained unaware. Lifting her leg, she prepared to use the high heel of her shoe to hook the keys. The high heel got stuck on the wooden frame holding the keys, and [Bonnie] skillfully took the entire frame off the cabinet.
0:5:40|0:5:51|Carefully placing it on the ground, [JC] used a one-legged stance to push the wooden frame under the car and hide it, then immediately stood up and walked away.
0:6:8|0:6:17|Thief [JC] played by Jackie Chan breaks into a secret base, wearing a unique armor covered in roller skates, sliding forward on the floor.
0:6:22|0:6:32|[JC] was blocked by a glass window, he lowered his head and fired two bullets from his back, then accelerated forward, breaking through the entire glass and leaping out.
0:6:49|0:6:57|A group of soldiers are closely following [JC] from behind, and he immediately slides under the nearby car.
0:7:4|0:7:16|[JC] hid under the car to avoid the sight of all the soldiers, but there were soldiers blocking the exit. [JC] had a sudden inspiration, slid along the tunnel wall, and rushed out of the tunnel mouth while they were unprepared.
0:7:23|0:7:38|Other soldiers also rode motorcycles to chase, [JC] wearing rollerblading clothes accelerated on the winding mountain road, 180-degree turns were effortless for him. He moved swiftly and invisibly, while the pursuers behind him continued to chase relentlessly.
0:7:39|0:7:45|[JC] stopped by the roadside to observe the soldiers in the distance, only to find two cars blocking his way ahead.
0:7:46|0:7:54|And with two cars gradually approaching from behind, [JC] turned and ran, as the two cars drove past a bend.
0:7:54|0:8:17|[JC], lying in ambush by the roadside, suddenly appears behind two cars. He accelerates and drives under the cars, grabbing onto the chassis and moving along with the vehicles. The soldiers in the car are puzzled: [JC] is hiding himself securely under the car, but the soldiers in the car are completely unaware. At this moment, the soldiers surrounding them in front say:
0:8:26|0:8:35|[JC] emerged from under the car and suddenly two trucks came driving towards him. With nowhere to hide, [JC] jumped onto the fence by the road, clinging to the vehicles to maintain balance, with a deep abyss behind him.
0:8:39|0:8:53|The soldier immediately hit the brakes, and two trucks came to a stop. [JC] took advantage of the situation and jumped over the fence back onto the road. A truck behind couldn't brake in time and collided. In the nick of time, [JC] slid under the truck. At this moment, a large group of soldiers on motorcycles came chasing after.
0:8:55|0:9:14|Soldiers set up a spiked barrier in the middle of the road. To better observe the pursuers, [JC] decided to slide while sitting down, and spotted a group of pursuers in the distance. Suddenly, a motorcycle started chasing him from behind, so [JC] switched to sliding while lying down.
0:9:14|0:9:33|JC suddenly stood up and spun in place as the motorcycle approached. He went around to the back of the motorcycle and pulled the soldier off, dragging him on the ground. Another motorcycle came chasing after him. He then threw the soldier on the road, with the soldier's pants already worn out, revealing his underwear.
0:9:35|0:9:46|[JC] attacked another motorcycle again, grabbing the front of the bike and pulling it backwards, lifting the motorcycle in place. Using the leverage principle, he threw the motorcycle and the rider together flying out.
0:9:46|0:10:7|Glancing back, two motorcycles were approaching from behind. [JC] immediately turned around and fled, while the soldiers blocking the road below were making it impassable. [JC] cleverly maneuvered around the roadblock and slid along the wall. The soldiers who were surrounding [JC] immediately opened fire when they saw him, but [JC] took the opportunity to dive into the sewer next to the road.
0:10:7|0:10:25|In the narrow and dim sewer pipe, [JC] continued to move forward with agility. At the other end of the pipe was a cliff. [JC] flew out and grabbed a net woven from hemp rope in mid-air. He took off his helmet and breathed a sigh of relief, looking up to see a helicopter hovering in the air.
0:10:30|0:10:35|[JC] gave a thumbs up to his teammates and answered a phone call while in mid-air.
0:10:51|0:11:1|The title of the movie appears on the screen. A helicopter flies [JC] over from the air, and the scene shifts to the Summer Palace. [JC] is disguised as a journalist using the alias Professor Martin.
0:12:44|0:13:8|[JC] placed the backpack and camera on the table, took out a pair of white gloves from the bag. Professor Guan saw this and said, "[JC] is pretending to touch the bronze statue, but actually scanning the data of the statue with the gloves." At the same time, [JC]'s teammate [David] had already received the data on the computer and said to [Bonnie] behind him, "[David] excitedly looked at the computer." Just then, [Simon] rode in on a motorcycle.
0:13:9|0:13:21|He got off the car and walked over, reaching out to pat [David] on the shoulder. The machine on the side had already created an exact bronze statue mold based on the data. On the other side, [JC] scanned the bronze statue one by one.
0:13:21|0:13:38|He occasionally raised his head nervously pretending to be calm, [David] continuously received data transmitted by [JC], and the mold was about to be completed. Finally, the machine sprayed out a burst of fire, burning the mold into a copper product, creating a lifelike animal head copper statue.
0:13:38|0:13:45|[Bonnie] pushed open the cabinet door of the machine, [Simon] took it out, and they arrived in Paris with the fake animal head.
0:13:58|0:14:8|[JC] and [Bonnie] pushed the luggage out, while [Simon] and [David] were waiting at the door. The four of them drove to a viaduct.
0:14:9|0:14:17|Threw the fake beast head bronze statue into the water. A group of volunteers on the roadside were holding signs and shouting.
0:15:12|0:15:21|[JC] threw the key at the man's face, the man cursed and turned away, [JC] walked in.
0:17:44|0:17:50|The group of four made a fake album of animal heads and arrived at a luxurious mansion.
0:17:51|0:18:7|The duo drove the sightseeing car to guide the four-person team's car into the estate. At this moment, [JC] sneaked into the estate and hid in the dark of the woods. He climbed a tree and found an excellent vantage point as the car drove through one gate after another.
0:18:7|0:18:17|At this moment, [JC] is sitting on a tree with a telescope set up. He takes out his phone and two pieces of gum. On the screen of the telescope, [Bonnie] and the castle's butler are having a conversation.
0:19:6|0:19:12|David and Bonnie are sitting in the car studying the surveillance of the manor.
0:19:21|0:19:28|[JC] climbed down from the tree upside down along the rope.
0:19:29|0:19:43|[JC] followed [David]'s instructions and started to act. A security guard looked puzzled at the suddenly malfunctioning monitor, while [JC] had successfully sneaked into the mansion. The surveillance equipment in the control room also returned to normal, and the guard had no suspicions at all.
0:19:43|0:20:11|Inside the castle, [JC] enters through the window, grabbing a piece of bread from the table and stuffing it into his mouth. At the same time, two cars pull up to the estate. [JC] quickly heads up the stairs, stealthily hiding behind a pillar. He puts on a pair of AR glasses for observation and spots fingerprints on the railing through the glasses.
0:20:13|0:20:25|[JC] followed the trail of fingerprints forward, while his teammates anxiously watched the surveillance footage and said, "Quickly run to the room, hide in the corner and scan the tall bookshelves for clues."
0:20:27|0:20:36|[JC] accidentally stepped on the floor and made a noise, he took a step back, looked around, and then sprinted up to the second level of the bookshelf.
0:20:38|0:20:49|He took out a flashlight and held it in his mouth as he groped forward, finding a hidden door but unable to push it open.
0:20:51|0:20:58|He then found a mechanism on the nearby bookshelf, covered with numbers.
0:21:3|0:21:14|Suddenly, someone walked in and [JC] quickly restored the mechanism to its original state. He ran forward closely against the bookshelf and crouched against the wall in a blind spot.
0:21:14|0:21:26|Two maids carrying vacuum cleaners walked in, [JC] looked at the ceiling, then at the maids downstairs. He gritted his teeth, climbed up the railing to the second floor, and hid at the top of the bookshelf.
0:21:26|0:21:41|The maid looked up at the sound, glanced at the dust on the table, and said, "[JC] was crouching on top of the bookshelf observing the books below, finally he noticed something wrong."
0:22:3|0:22:8|[JC] suddenly realized, muttering to himself.
0:22:18|0:22:27|The two maids walked out of the study and [JC] struggled to sit up from the top of the bookshelf.
0:22:28|0:22:34|He rolled over and jumped down, carefully taking out the mechanism that had just been set up.
0:22:52|0:23:5|[JC] successfully opened the password door, pushed it open, and then carefully closed the door. What came into view was a room filled with treasures.
0:23:5|0:23:24|Teammates outside were anxiously waiting, [JC] ran down the stairs and headed straight to a box. He squatted down and effortlessly opened the box, next to which was another wooden box that was also unlocked.
0:23:29|0:23:44|[JC] heard what [Bonnie] said, then looked at the table beside him and took off his glasses in surprise.
0:23:54|0:24:8|[David] and [Bonnie] happily high-fived each other upon hearing the news, while [JC] sneaked in with stolen artifacts on his back. Passing through a room filled with paintings, he hesitated for a moment before turning back.
0:24:8|0:24:16|He lay on the ground and opened the door a crack, carefully observing the painting on the wall in the sunlight coming through the crack.
0:24:30|0:24:37|[JC] placed two chairs against the wall, climbed up using the armchair, and took down the painting on the wall with a desk lamp.
0:25:10|0:25:32|He went downstairs from the other side but was scared back by the security guard walking a dog. [JC] was chased by two dogs to the end of the corridor, then jumped out of the window. Looking up, he saw the security guard chasing after him, so he immediately turned around and ran towards the roof. He jumped and leaped on the several meters high roof, moving forward along one window sill after another.
0:25:32|0:25:39|There was a distance of about one or two meters between the window sills, and [JC] didn't hesitate at all, smoothly jumping onto the roof opposite.
0:25:47|0:26:4|[JC] took a big leap onto a balcony, then bent down from the balcony and climbed down the wall step by step. Finally, he landed perfectly with a high-difficulty rotation, only to be greeted by several vicious dogs rushing towards him.
0:26:8|0:26:24|[JC] was chased by several vicious dogs into a garden. In order to avoid being caught by the dogs, he ran while erasing his tracks. After erasing all traces, he blindly felt his way into an entrance like a blind man touching an elephant.
0:26:26|0:26:45|Teammates outside watching the monitor said, "[JC] took out the paraglider, facing the four exits in front of him, at a loss."
0:26:59|0:27:22|Like a headless fly running around, several vicious dogs chased after, but running back and forth in circles, unable to escape no matter what. [JC] appeared exhausted, suddenly two vicious dogs circled in front of [JC] to block him, they hesitated for a moment and didn't dare to move.
0:27:24|0:27:47|[JC] turned around cautiously, ready to run, but the vicious dog immediately chased after him. Another vicious dog ran past him without noticing him, giving him the chance to sprint away. As the two dogs behind him closed in, he had no choice but to open the parachute and start running. The parachute lifted him up into the air.
0:27:49|0:28:12|But not long after flying, he fell down. The dog in the bushes stuck its head out and barked at [JC]. [JC] hurried forward, only to run into a dead end. In desperation, [JC] bit off a few leaves, then lay on the ground imitating a dog's bark, trying to scare off the vicious dog. Seeing this, two vicious dogs...
0:28:12|0:28:17|JC stopped in his tracks, not daring to move forward. His superb acting skills made the fierce dog retreat repeatedly.
0:28:19|0:28:31|[JC] spoke and a leaf fell down. Seeing this, the vicious dog suddenly pounced. [JC] immediately stood up to take off again, but because he was flying too low, he hit the trees and fell down.
0:28:31|0:28:40|JC swung around the head of the vicious dog and threw it to the ground, then turned and ran away before it could catch up.
0:28:57|0:29:14|Two more came in a flash, [JC] was at a loss, trying to take off again, and finally managed to fly over the walls of the maze. Several vicious dogs on the ground barked at him. At the same time, Pierre and [CoCo] walked out of the castle.
0:29:20|0:29:28|At this moment, [JC] has successfully flown out of the castle walls.
0:29:31|0:29:51|[JC] emerged from the bushes by the side of the road. At that moment, [Coco] was driving towards him. When she saw [JC], she stopped the car in surprise and exclaimed. [JC] widened his eyes, turned around, and ran. [Coco] quickly drove after him.
0:30:28|0:30:37|A bus came towards them head-on, the bus driver unable to brake in time. [JC] hit the glass head-on and the parachute carried him to the top of the bus.
0:30:38|0:30:45|After the car drove past, he landed steadily on the ground, and then [CoCo] hit the brakes and looked back at [JC].
0:30:47|0:30:58|[Coco] drove away, [JC] also turned and slipped into the bushes by the road, trekking over hills and valleys all the way to find [Simon].
0:31:0|0:31:31|[JC] dashed down the hill without hesitation and opened the glider, while [Simon] drove around looking for [JC]'s location. [JC] descended with the parachute, and [Simon] drove the car right to where he was landing. [JC] jumped into the car without missing a beat, while [Coco] was studying the rabbit head at the dock.
0:32:2|0:32:8|[Simon] recognized Mr. Pierre's bodyguard and quickly got out of the car. He walked up and patted one of them on the shoulder.
0:32:9|0:32:15|He suddenly started to throw them all into the water, while Mr. Pierre helplessly shook his head on the side.
0:32:21|0:32:37|Pick up the phone and call the police. [Simon] stands on the slope by the river, agilely dodging the enemy's attacks. He turns around, feints a punch at the enemy, and then pushes him into the river when he least expects it. [JC] hears the commotion at the dock and runs to the window to see what's going on.
0:32:37|0:32:44|Seeing a bodyguard who fell into the water trying to climb ashore, [JC] pulled him back into the water.
0:32:48|0:33:10|Simon was still locked in a battle of wits with the bodyguard when JC rushed over from a distance. He grabbed the bodyguard's clothes and covered his head, raising his hands while also pushing the black-clad person next to him into the water.
0:34:30|0:34:37|[Jia Fulian] leads [Coco] and [JC] into the castle, where two cars are parked not far away.
0:35:3|0:35:9|[JC] was surprised to find a chicken-headed bronze statue on the windowsill of the stairs, exclaiming:
0:41:2|0:41:23|[JC] and his teammates behind him exchanged frantic glances, as [Simon] and [Bonnie] walked over. [David] gestured to [JC] to come over, then revealed an expression of disbelief.
0:42:19|0:42:38|[JC] and [Simon] excitedly high-fived, the four of them were like they had been injected with chicken blood, starting to carry out their theft plan. They stayed in the castle openly under the guise of helping out, and the naive and just [Coco] was deceived by them into helping them obtain Professor Guan's data.
0:42:39|0:42:46|[David] got the data and was ready to start making counterfeits. To facilitate their actions, they became close with the castle's bodyguards.
0:42:47|0:42:53|[Simon] hid the chicken head bronze statue in a pile of balloons and successfully brought the fake chicken head inside.
0:42:54|0:43:4|[JC] flipped the window and threw the pilot down, [David] and [Simon] handed the fake to [JC], successfully completing the switcheroo.
0:43:6|0:43:12|Three of them sealed the real bronze chicken head statue, changed its packaging to colorful, and smuggled it out mixed in balloons.
0:43:18|0:43:40|Zongsheng flew in on a private jet to inspect the results. Seeing their spoils, Zongsheng gave a thumbs up in delight. After achieving their goal, [JC] began to fulfill his promise to help [Jia Fulian] find her great-grandfather. He looked at the painting of [Jia Fulian]'s great-grandfather thoughtfully, then took out his phone and snapped a photo.
0:43:40|0:43:55|Calm sea surface, a boat sailed by with the [JC] quartet, accompanied by [Coco] and [Jia Fulian]. They released a drone, preparing to search for traces of [Jia Fulian]'s great-grandfather at sea, while someone in the distance was observing them.
0:44:2|0:44:26|[Simon] seemed preoccupied, pouring out a ring from an envelope and then deep in thought as he took out another ring from around his neck. As the aerial search plane returned, on the other side, [Bonnie] shed tears in secret, missing her daughter.
0:44:27|0:44:40|The small plane captured a place that looked very similar to the scenery in the painting, and everyone's faces lit up with anticipation.
0:44:41|0:44:56|Six people full of anticipation, speeding towards their destination on a speedboat, finally arrived. Afterwards, [JC] took out a tablet and carefully compared, discovering that the scenery in front of them was identical to the painting of [Jia Fulian]'s great-grandfather.
0:47:20|0:47:38|[JC] grabbed [Jia Fulian]'s arm, but the two of them were too heavy, and [JC] was pulled down as well. The crack was filled with vines, and the three of them grabbed onto the vines but continued to fall. They shouted in panic as they fell, until the vines finally got stuck, and the three of them hung in mid-air, swaying back and forth.
0:47:54|0:48:1|[JC] caught her effortlessly, and [CoCo] fell down heavily on top of [JC].
0:48:27|0:48:42|[JC] moved his hand away, and [Jia Fulian] immediately couldn't support herself, she let go of the vine and pulled [Coco] down the cliff. She was blocked by a wooden board, and [JC] couldn't hold on and fell down, hitting [Jia Fulian] at the bottom of the cliff.
0:48:43|0:48:49|[JC] struggled to get up and found Miss [Jia Fulian] following the sound.
0:49:5|0:49:15|[JC] climbed up a high ground, looking around for [CoCo]'s figure. He took out a flashlight and shouted:
0:49:35|0:49:41|[Jia Fulian] stood up and glanced at [CoCo]'s feet, exclaiming in surprise.
0:49:48|0:49:55|Seeing [CoCo] dislocate her foot, [JC] and [Simon] cooperated to distract [CoCo]'s attention, saying:
0:50:35|0:50:41|[JC] discovered the wreckage of a ship.
0:50:48|0:51:6|[JC] shone a flashlight as [Jia Fulian] followed closely behind, entering a dilapidated cabin. [Jia Fulian] picked up a ring from the ground, gently brushing off the dirt on top, and exclaimed:
0:51:31|0:51:54|The two left with the remains of [Jia Fulian]'s great-grandfather. On the other side, [Simon] used a dagger to cut a small opening in a large tree, inside of which were shining pieces of gold. [Simon] and [David] stared at each other in disbelief, and they used a device to detect that every tree was filled with gold.
0:52:12|0:52:18|The captain took out the medicine chest and appeared at the edge of the cliff.
0:54:23|0:54:30|The four of them exchanged smiles, and [JC] instantly understood.
0:54:46|0:54:52|What surprised everyone was that Pierre brought people with him.
0:57:41|0:57:59|He pulled the trigger of the rocket launcher, the bald pirate carrying the rocket launcher stood still and watched as the rocket flew out, into the dense vines. The people on the ground raised their heads, only to see the rocket entangled with a vine, swinging back and forth due to inertia, before slowly coming to a stop.
0:57:59|0:58:6|The pirate quickly turned around, and the pirate behind him was blown up by a rocket launcher, with smoke billowing from his whole body.
0:58:17|0:58:29|[Simon] kicked away the pirate's gun, only to find him pulling out another one, but to his surprise, the gun was empty. [Simon] knocked him down to the ground, just as a flying knife grazed past his head, causing [Simon] to turn around and run in fear.
0:58:31|0:58:51|[David] is engaged in a battle of wits and courage with a pirate holding a dagger, while [JC] shouts to him. Pierre and his henchmen are watching on the side, with one pirate trying to reach for a gun on the ground. [JC] steps forward and gives him a slap, causing him to roll onto another pirate in the end.
0:58:51|0:58:59|One foot stepped on the pirate's hand, taking away his gun. [JC] and the remaining pirates struggled and fought.
0:59:5|0:59:15|[JC] moved the log under his feet, causing the pirate to slip and fall. The captain hesitated in front of a crevice, but [JC] quickly picked him up and threw him to the other side.
0:59:22|0:59:30|JC is still fighting with a pirate, the two of them are evenly matched.
0:59:31|0:59:51|A pirate threw the object under him, and [David] exclaimed in shock: [Simon] was fighting three opponents on the deck, swinging on a vine in mid-air. He finally grabbed another pirate's arm, trying to pull him down, but unexpectedly, he was saved by his comrade.
0:59:51|1:0:12|Below deck, a pirate slipped down and [Simon] rushed forward to punch him. The pirate got scared and ran away. [David] picked up a pirate and threw him out. [Simon] used a shoulder throw to knock down a pirate. Then, [Simon] threw a hand grenade towards [David] with his feet. Meanwhile, chaos broke out on the deck as a pirate grabbed [Coco]'s foot.
1:0:13|1:0:19|In desperation, [Coco] pulled out a bone from behind [Jia Fulian] and smashed it towards the pirate.
1:0:31|1:0:41|[Jia Fulian] also took out a bone and swung it towards the pirate's head. The pirate was knocked unconscious on the ground. Just as he was about to open his eyes, the two of them struck him again.
1:0:52|1:1:0|[JC] had one foot on the boat and the other on the edge of the cliff, grabbing [Jia Fulian]'s hand and pulling her to the other side.
1:1:21|1:1:28|[JC] picked up a boot and put it on [CoCo]'s foot.
1:1:35|1:1:50|A pirate suddenly emerged, while on the other side, [JC] encountered another pirate and swiftly cut the vine in his hand with a dagger.
1:2:22|1:2:52|[Jia Fulian] picked up the gun, closed her eyes, and wildly fired around. Everyone scattered and fled, hiding everywhere. They got up to prepare to escape, but the pirates behind them chased after them.
1:2:57|1:3:2|They were surrounded by pirates again, and the bald pirate looked at the rocket launcher.
1:3:13|1:3:33|The vine that was entwined with the rocket suddenly dropped down, leaving the rocket hanging and swaying on the vine. Everyone stared at the rocket, holding their breath, watching quietly as it swayed. The precarious rocket tugged at the hearts of everyone present, and their eyes followed the rocket's movements. Just as the situation was about to reach a critical point,
1:3:33|1:3:48|A pirate climbed up from the bottom of the ship holding a vine, everyone's heart was in their mouth, all aiming rocket launchers at him. The pirate, just climbed up, looked at everyone in confusion, took a step forward inexplicably.
1:3:50|1:4:4|The rocket, under the pull of the vines, broke free from its restraints and plummeted towards the ground, causing everyone to scream and scatter. Upon impact, the rocket exploded, shattering everything around it.
1:4:17|1:4:24|[JC] unexpectedly discovered the bronze statue of a sheep's head in the chaos, and the pirate gang followed closely behind.
1:4:25|1:4:30|[JC] threw a smoke bomb over, scaring the pirates into turning and running away.
1:5:42|1:5:51|The group of four climbed up the big tree together, preparing to leave by riding on it, but the tree didn't budge at all.
1:5:55|1:6:11|They were preparing to unlock the iron chains binding the big tree, as the pirate gang got closer and closer to them. The pirates started shooting at the main characters. [JC] picked up a censer nearby and threw it at the pirates, only to have it shattered by a gunshot from the other side.
1:6:34|1:6:39|A swarm of bees flew towards the pirates, causing chaos among the pirate gang.
1:6:48|1:7:24|[JC] threw the grenade towards the iron chain. After the explosion, everyone looked at the iron chain that was stuck on the big tree, surprisingly it was not destroyed. Bees attacking the pirates in the distance started to fly back. [JC] shouted, "Everyone in the main group, smoke bombs ready!" and threw them towards the incoming bees. At that moment, the iron chain binding the big tree broke, and everyone lined up and rode on the tree.
1:7:24|1:7:38|The big tree slid down the hill but got stuck again. However, under the influence of gravity, the big tree broke free from the restraints, shaking off all the iron chains on its body, and tumbled down the mountain, raising clouds of dust around it.
1:7:43|1:7:54|The pirate gang relentlessly chased after them.
1:8:12|1:8:26|At this moment, the main characters are riding a big tree down the mountain, being hit by leaves and branches constantly. The mountain road is rugged, and everyone is being tossed around by the uneven slopes.
1:8:27|1:8:41|The big rock suddenly flew up as the tree passed by, causing everyone to lose balance and almost get thrown out. [JC] quickly grabbed [CoCo], who was about to be thrown out, and pulled her back.
1:8:45|1:9:7|Everyone cheered happily as they finally reached the bottom of the mountain. Ahead was a giant tree that seemed unstoppable, carrying everyone towards the sea. The tree crashed into the ocean, creating huge splashes of water. Due to inertia, everyone was thrown into the water separately.
1:9:15|1:9:32|The captain steered the boat towards them as they desperately shouted for help. The boat approached them, and they climbed onto the floating tree trunk. The captain stuck his head out and shouted at them.
1:10:18|1:10:40|Six people stood at the edge of the deck, holding wine glasses and bottles, facing the sunset and cheering in the sea breeze. A tree filled with gold was tied to the ship, floating on the sea. As night fell, everyone got drunk. [Coco] escorted [JC] back to the room and accidentally discovered a photo of him on the table, only then did she realize,
1:10:40|1:10:48|In the midst of a scam, [Coco] looked at [JC] in pain and shock. The next day,
1:14:24|1:14:35|[JC] ran to the stern of the ship, only to see the big tree soaked in water, starting to sink. His face changed, and he immediately flipped over the railing and jumped into the sea. One end of the big tree sank into the sea, with the gold nuggets inside falling to the seabed.
1:14:36|1:14:52|[JC] took a look at the sinking gold nuggets at the bottom of the deep sea, only to find that they had disappeared into the tree hole. [Simon] and [David] rushed over, and the three of them anxiously gestured to each other as they looked at the scattered gold nuggets on the seabed, but they were all at a loss.
1:14:52|1:14:58|The three of them struggled to surface from the sea.
1:15:55|1:16:7|[JC] threw the gold bars into the sea after speaking, then looked at [CoCo]. [CoCo] furrowed her brows and remained silent. Her teammates beside her inappropriately applauded, and [CoCo] turned around and left.
1:16:16|1:16:26|The priceless gold ingot was left in this sea, and everyone continued forward with a sense of loss. The turbulent sea surface was like the emotions of everyone at this moment.
1:17:3|1:17:11|At this moment, a group of people are fighting in a parking lot.
1:17:28|1:17:37|The police officer took out two photos of two young men with blood all over their faces.
1:18:12|1:18:22|The streets were filled with protesters and journalists from various countries protesting against the sale of cultural relics, and [Coco] joined them. A journalist said to [Coco]:
1:19:24|1:19:40|Reporters were bombarding the entrance of MP company with questions, while [Coco]'s younger brother Wu Qing and two colleagues were secretly filming near the MP company.
1:19:46|1:19:52|Suddenly a hand reached out from the bushes and grabbed Michelle's hair, causing Wu Qing to also be punched in the face and fall to the ground.
1:21:18|1:21:25|Picked up the letter left on the ground by [JC].
1:21:26|1:21:32|[JC] walked out of the room, [Coco] sat pale-faced on a chair. He stood up slowly, and [JC] asked softly:
1:22:34|1:22:50|[Coco] walked out without looking back after speaking. Beside her, [Bonnie] cried with red eyes after reading the letter from [Simon]. [JC] looked puzzled.
1:22:51|1:23:2|[JC] stood with hands on hips, then opened the surveillance footage to secretly observe [CoCo]'s actions after she left. He saw [CoCo] crouching in a corner, crying in pain, with [Bonnie] shedding tears beside her.
1:23:3|1:23:23|[JC] turned off the screen and fell into contemplation. As he turned around to look for his phone, he saw a letter from [Simon] on the coffee table and sat down. The letter contained a torn family photo in the middle, with a childish note written next to it: "Mom and Dad, do you really want it this way?"
1:23:23|1:23:29|At this moment, Bonnie, with her makeup smeared, walked in. Coco said:
1:25:0|1:25:7|Shortly after, [JC] and [Bonnie] drove to the MP company.
1:25:25|1:25:35|[JC] took off his leather jacket and carefully took out the painting of the bee to hand it to Michael.
1:25:50|1:25:56|Michael ignored [JC] and said to the staff:
1:27:48|1:27:57|The thief Nine-Headed Bird on the second floor greets [JC], who looks at him without saying a word.
1:28:21|1:28:29|[JC] accurately caught the wine thrown by the Nine-Headed Bird and said:
1:29:4|1:29:18|[JC] smiled and placed the wine bottle aside, provocatively saying: [JC] stepped on the foot that Nine-Headed Bird had just lifted, then used his right foot to control the other foot of Nine-Headed Bird. The two of them stood facing each other like this.
1:29:18|1:29:29|Suddenly, [JC] smashed the bottle in his hand towards [JC], who cleverly avoided it. Nine-Headed Bird kicked towards the chair where [JC] was sitting, giving [JC] the chance to flip onto the sofa. Nine-Headed Bird couldn't dodge in time.
1:29:34|1:29:56|Unexpectedly, the Nine-Headed Bird's foot was still on the edge of the sofa. The Nine-Headed Bird lifted the sofa and pushed [JC] down, and the two rolled over at the same time, facing each other in combat. [JC] grabbed the Nine-Headed Bird's arm, but the Nine-Headed Bird, unwilling to show weakness, forcefully turned and broke free from the restraint. [JC] flipped over, causing both to lose balance and fall to the ground. They quickly got up, and [JC] made a flip to dodge the Nine-Headed Bird's attack.
1:29:56|1:30:12|JC immediately grabbed Nine-Headed Bird's wrist and controlled him on the back of the sofa. Unable to break free, Nine-Headed Bird flipped over, throwing both of them to the ground. They quickly got up and sat back on the sofa, continuing to wrestle with each other, making it hard to determine the winner.
1:30:12|1:30:32|The Nine-Headed Bird stood on the sofa, and [JC] had a sudden inspiration to strike him from behind. The Nine-Headed Bird lost balance but managed to clamp [JC] with his legs around the waist. They both fell back to back to the ground, then propped themselves up with their hands on the ground, feet on the sofa, and continued fighting. They stood on the edges of two sofas, each grabbing onto the same sofa, starting an intense sofa-grabbing segment.
1:30:32|1:30:51|JC's teammate at Jiutou Bird hooked the sofa under JC's feet and pulled it back. With a kick, the sofa was sent back to its original position. JC jumped up and sat on the sofa. Jiutou Bird rushed over, and the two rolled on the ground in a tangle. Jiutou Bird took out the sofa cushion in his hand to indicate that JC had lost. JC also took out the sofa cushion behind him and said:
1:31:2|1:31:7|[Bonnie] suddenly noticed someone on the stairs across from her, wondering if Wu Qing and the others might be trapped here.
1:31:38|1:31:59|[JC] pointed to the spot just now, and the bodyguard quickly stopped [JC]. Michael hid the painting behind his back as he spoke.
1:32:6|1:32:29|[JC] turned around and ran towards the stairs to block him, with the security guard chasing after him. Suddenly, two security guards appeared in front to intercept. [JC] immediately ran towards the boiler next to the railing. On the iron railing leading to the top of the boiler, [JC] engaged in a struggle with the security guards, using the gap in the middle of the iron railing to maneuver flexibly around the enemies.
1:32:29|1:32:47|The reinforcements kept increasing, [JC] jumped down along the railing and landed on the ventilation box below. To maintain balance, he grabbed the security guard's clothes. After standing firm, he pushed the security guard down using the iron cover of the ventilation box, and [JC] watched the commotion from above.
1:32:49|1:33:7|The remaining security guards caught up. [JC] agilely jumped to an open space, shaking off the pursuing guards behind. Then [JC] ran into the laboratory, where two guards were waiting to catch him, and the two guards joined forces to attack [JC].
1:33:7|1:33:16|In the end, with his two fists no match for four hands, [JC] was heavily kicked in the chest. He used a push-pull technique to trap the enemy in the middle of the door, disarmed the enemy, and wedged the door shut.
1:33:20|1:33:36|Suddenly, another security guard appeared behind him. [JC] grabbed the handrail behind the security guard, leaped up, crossed over the security guard, slid down the handrail, and finally landed on the ground floor while holding onto a pillar. The security guards on the ground floor saw [JC] and rushed towards him. In an instant, [JC] was surrounded by a group of security guards.
1:33:36|1:33:44|[JC], whose strength was gradually failing, was continuously attacked by the security guards.
1:33:47|1:33:53|[Bonnie] saw the situation turning against her, she grabbed the water bottle from the side of Keel and smashed it on the heads of the two security guards holding [JC] down.
1:33:54|1:34:11|[JC] immediately launched a counterattack against the two, breaking free from the restraints. Unexpectedly, both [JC] and the security guards were hit on the feet by the falling wooden crate. Feeling dissatisfied about the stolen water bottle, Keir threw the cap at [Bonnie]'s face.
1:34:11|1:34:19|And downstairs, [JC] is still grappling with the security guards. Under [JC]'s relentless attacks, the guards are falling one by one and unable to get up.
1:34:25|1:34:55|[Bonnie] rubbed her fists and kicked the chair behind her, while Keel also took off his stance and prepared for battle. Keel launched the first attack, but was easily dodged by [Bonnie]. Seizing the opportunity, [Bonnie] counterattacked with a series of kicks, forcing Keel to retreat. Keel dodged two roundhouse kicks and found the right moment to attack with a foot strike from the ground, using the inertia of landing to target [Bonnie]'s lower body. Finally, both of them simultaneously executed roundhouse kicks, with Keel firmly pressing down on [Bonnie]'s foot with his own.
1:34:55|1:34:58|[Bonnie] found the opening and broke the deadlock with a flying kick.
1:34:58|1:35:16|On the other side, [JC] was entangled in a fight with a security guard, and another guard behind him joined in. [JC] agilely maneuvered through the gaps in the canvas rack, grabbed the guard's arm, and pulled him along with the canvas to the ground. The guards were unable to get up, and [JC] happily started chewing gum.
1:35:21|1:35:39|At this moment, [Bonnie] and JC were still evenly matched, flipping over a table and ending up at the railing on the second floor. JC flipped over the railing and grabbed [Bonnie]'s foot, pulling her outward. [Bonnie] forcefully kicked her foot free, causing JC to lose balance and get stuck in mid-air.
1:35:39|1:35:50|In a disadvantaged position, JC refused to give up, gesturing to Bonnie, who readily accepted the challenge. Flipping over the railing, the two slid down the pipeline to the first floor, where Bonnie launched the first attack with a flying kick.
1:36:3|1:36:18|Michael looked incredulously at the Nine-Headed Bird, as Keir and [Bonnie] kept attacking each other. Keir's ankle pinned her to the ground, while on the other side, [JC] was grappling with two security guards, using his legs to bring one of them down.
1:36:18|1:36:38|Continuing with a spinning kick that knocks another person down, then soaring with a scissor kick that hurls another security guard heavily to the ground, [JC] chewing gum, ready to leave, is confronted by another security guard who picks up a weapon and swings at [JC], accidentally hitting the nearby boiler. Steam continuously gushes out from the cracks as the boiler starts to operate in overload.
1:36:38|1:36:55|All the numbers kept malfunctioning one after another. [JC] was surrounded by security guards in the darkroom. He moved the rack filled with plastic pipes to the front as a cover, using his palm to knock down the plastic pipes one by one, heavily smashing them on the faces of the security guards, knocking them down and jumping onto the table to avoid the guards' attacks.
1:36:55|1:37:14|He performed a backflip, knocking down the security guard behind him, then rolled to the other side of the table on the ground. Across the table, he delivered a spinning kick to the opponent. [JC] grabbed an unopened light shade nearby and smashed it at the enemy. He also grabbed an umbrella and used it as a weapon, using the reflective side as a shield to block all attacks.
1:37:14|1:37:26|Due to excessive force, the umbrella canopy fell off, prompting a security guard to pick up a weapon and stand up. [JC] threw the broken umbrella frame at the enemy and turned to run, but the security guards relentlessly chased after.
1:37:26|1:37:39|[JC] picked up a tripod as a weapon, the camera on the tripod flashing continuously. With agile attacks, [JC] gradually gained the upper hand, jumping behind a picture frame and knocking down the enemy in front of him.
1:37:39|1:37:55|Another security guard snatched [JC]'s tripod, but accidentally took a photo of [JC] sitting on a picture frame. [JC] kicked him out, but the tripod got stuck in his crotch, capturing [JC]'s painful expression on camera. [JC] walked out of the photo studio gagging, only to suddenly see the just-taken photo being printed out.
1:37:59|1:38:5|He closed the printer and ran towards the stairs, while Michael shouted:
1:38:9|1:38:16|The security guards lying on the ground got up one after another, and at this moment, the boiler next to them started to release steam frantically.
1:38:22|1:38:42|The boss and Jiutou Niao stood in disbelief. The explosion of the boiler shattered all the porcelain in the room, and for a moment, metal, stone, and glass fragments flew everywhere. [JC] lay on the stairs to avoid the explosion, and a huge box was blown into [Bonnie] who was lying on the ground.
1:38:42|1:38:56|Kiel pushed the box away at a critical moment, saving [Bonnie]'s life. Just after the explosion, [JC] urgently ran upstairs and opened a small door to sneak in. It turned out that Wu Qing and the others were indeed trapped inside.
1:39:1|1:39:17|At this moment, Michael and [JC] got up from the ground, and just then [Simon] walked in, looking at the verification center in front of him that had been blown to ruins.
1:39:20|1:39:31|Father [JC] took Wu Qing and two others away.
1:42:44|1:42:53|[JC] led the team to jump out of the plane one by one, while the journalist's helicopter was recording everything not far away.
1:43:6|1:43:20|JC's team is skydiving, with JC's silhouette appearing behind them.
1:43:31|1:43:46|The team near [JC] broke their formation and engaged in a fight with [JC] carrying the dragon head. Seeing this, [JC]'s teammates rushed to help. [JC] then turned around and performed a backflip, kicking the person attacking him from behind away.
1:43:46|1:44:1|He desperately clung to [JC], successfully grabbing the dragon's head. [JC] almost let go, but then grabbed the dragon's head tightly again. The two of them held onto each end of the dragon's head and refused to let go. [JC] kept spinning in the air and threw [JC] out.
1:44:1|1:44:9|JC, who got the dragon head, hadn't had time to be happy yet, when someone grabbed his ankle. JC's teammates came running one after another.
1:44:10|1:44:30|[JC] held up the dragon head, with enemies following one after another behind him. The 4 people holding onto each other's ankles formed a straight line, looking like a dragon flying in the sky from afar. [JC] turned around and kicked the person behind him, finally shaking off the enemies.
1:44:30|1:44:40|[JC] took out a bag while falling and put the dragon head into it. The Nine-headed Bird, unwilling to show weakness, flew towards [JC] again.
1:44:40|1:44:56|[JC] found himself surrounded by three people, looking around in confusion. The Nine-Headed Bird stared fiercely at [JC], then suddenly charged towards the dragon head. [JC] quickly moved the dragon head to the other side, only to have it snatched away by another person.
1:44:56|1:45:6|[JC] grabbed his foot to prevent him from escaping, and cleverly kicked the dragon head out of the enemy's hand. The dragon head fell rapidly, with [JC] closely following behind.
1:45:6|1:45:36|Suddenly, a person rushed over and stopped [JC]. [JC] tried to break free from the person holding him, but the enemies kept coming at him one after another. [JC] kicked them away one by one. Keel rushed over and engaged in a fight with [JC]. [JC] grabbed his helmet, took it off, and smashed it against his head. Keel started to suffocate, lost consciousness, and fell down. [JC] immediately rushed forward upon seeing this.
1:45:36|1:46:2|He hugged the unconscious Kyle and shouted, "In this moment of danger, [JC] opened Kyle's parachute, handed his oxygen mask to Kyle's teammate, and said to him, holding out his helmet, flying towards Kyle. [JC] turned around to find the Nine-headed Bird."
1:46:3|1:46:10|JC immediately chased after the dragon head thrown by Jiutou Niao towards the volcano, which had slipped from his hand and was falling towards the mouth of the volcano.
1:46:12|1:46:26|The journalists on the helicopter were reporting the situation on the scene, while [JC] and Coco flew towards the dragon's head. The helicopter appeared untimely below them, and they quickly opened their parachutes to avoid a collision with the helicopter.
1:46:26|1:46:44|Watching the dragon head falling rapidly, [JC] gritted his teeth and released the parachute. Seeing this, the Nine-Headed Bird also released the parachute, accelerating towards [JC]. The dragon head was within reach, just as [JC] was about to grab it, the Nine-Headed Bird came forward and held him back.
1:46:51|1:46:57|The Nine-Headed Bird tied [JC] to himself, opened the reserve parachute, and the reporters on the ground watched anxiously.
1:47:9|1:47:15|[Coco] and her colleagues gathered around the TV watching the news about [JC], who was being controlled by the Nine-Headed Bird and unable to move.
1:47:37|1:47:55|JC's gaze was firm as the volcano's crater got closer and closer. At the last moment, he gritted his teeth and grabbed onto the dragon's head. The volcano emitted black smoke and occasional bursts of flames as JC tightly held onto the dragon's head, descending down the volcano.
1:47:57|1:48:15|He opened the airbag on his clothes, roaring as he rolled down the hillside. The excessive speed combined with the uneven terrain caused [JC]'s body to be repeatedly rubbed by the rocks on the mountain, and there was still a long distance to the ground. [JC] could only keep rolling down.
1:48:19|1:48:25|Lawrence father and son, [Jia Fulian] and [CoCo], who were watching the news, now had looks of astonishment, shock, and concern on their faces.
1:48:26|1:48:35|[JC]'s airbag was punctured one by one during the fall, and the dragon head in his hand flew out of control.
1:48:36|1:48:51|The journalist at the foot of the mountain looked at [JC] with concern, but no miracle happened at this moment. The airbags on [JC] had all been damaged. He landed heavily on a rock and immediately got up to search for the lost dragon head.
1:48:51|1:49:6|Taking off the goggles, eyes glaring red as he looked around, but with his strength failing, [JC] couldn't take a single step forward. [JC] knelt heavily on the ground, frowning in pain, and then fell to the ground unable to get up.
1:49:6|1:49:17|Simon and David, who arrived by helicopter, anxiously looked at him. Reporters also rushed towards JC. At this moment, everyone was shocked by the scene before them.
1:49:17|1:49:35|The just landed Nine-Headed Bird effortlessly found the Dragon's Head. He lifted the Dragon's Head and looked at it with a smile of relief. He walked towards the barely conscious [JC], placed the Dragon's Head beside him, and said.
1:49:36|1:49:43|The Nine-Headed Bird turned and left, [JC] showing a satisfied smile as his vision gradually blurred.
1:49:45|1:49:51|He lay on the ground trembling and struggling, watching [Simon] and [David] running towards him in the distance.
1:49:52|1:49:59|Watching the helicopters flying back and forth in the sky, JC closed his eyes and passed out peacefully.
1:50:3|1:50:8|In the end, [JC] was saved and everyone gathered in his hospital room watching the news.
1:52:5|1:52:24|[Simon] led his daughter towards [Bonnie], [JC] suddenly pulled out a ring and said to [Bonnie]:
1:52:39|1:52:54|David's wife lies on the hospital bed, with a happy smile on her face.
1:53:0|1:53:8|[JC] looked at his wife who suddenly appeared with surprise.
