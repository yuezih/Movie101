0:2:2|0:2:8|He then exerted force to prop up his upper body and sat up. He then walked outside the house.
0:2:21|0:2:34|Looking at the calm lake, the man looked up at the sky and lit a cigarette. With this, the movie "Extraordinary Mission" officially begins. The scene shifts, and he is washing his face, then hears a noise.
0:2:36|0:2:51|His name is [Lin Kai], who is now staring at a dirty mirror, gazing at himself. In the dimly lit room, the man with a beard took out several packages of something resembling flour from the cabinet, and handed the list in his hand to the young man opposite him.
0:2:52|0:3:7|The young man quickly put away the powdery small package and paper into his backpack. Then he bowed to the bearded man and turned around to leave the room. It seems that he is one of the bearded man's henchmen.
0:3:17|0:3:24|Lin Kai's henchman, carrying a bag, walked through the narrow passage towards them.
0:3:42|0:3:56|[Lin Kai] took the list from Bin Ge's hands. Seeing [Lin Kai] putting the powdery substance into the backpack, [Li Jianguo] ordered.
0:3:58|0:4:8|[Li Jianguo] smiled and watched as the others left, then walked over to [Lin Kai] who was packing up the trunk. After speaking, [Lin Kai] walked around to the driver's seat and got into the car.
0:4:10|0:4:18|On the other side, the bearded man sat on the boss chair, took out a phone from his pocket, put it to his ear, and spoke softly.
0:4:19|0:4:33|On the rugged and dark mountain road, only [Li Jianguo] and [Lin Kai]'s cars were driving one after the other. [Li Jianguo] was smoking, casually glanced at the rearview mirror, then reached out of the window to signal to [Lin Kai] to split up at the fork in the road ahead.
0:4:34|0:4:43|So [Lin Kai] made a sharp turn and headed downhill. [Li Jianguo] glanced at the rearview mirror, took a puff of smoke, and said.
0:5:3|0:5:17|Glancing at the rearview mirror, [Lin Kai] suddenly turned around and saw a police car approaching him. About to step on the gas and flee, he noticed a temporary roadblock ahead at the bridge. So he had no choice but to grit his teeth and drive forward.
0:5:33|0:5:42|[Lin Kai] raised his hands, turned around and lay on the car. The police searched him, while others checked the trunk and found a tire.
0:5:44|0:5:50|At this moment, the black bag slipped out, and one of the police officers walked towards [Lin Kai] holding something.
0:5:57|0:6:13|After speaking, the police officer took out handcuffs. At that moment, [Lin Kai] suddenly turned around, swiftly threw a punch, knocking the opponent to the ground. Then he quickly got into the car, smoothly shifted gears, and drifted in place.
0:6:16|0:6:32|[Lin Kai] took advantage of the chaos, pushed open the car door, bent down to pick up the small bag, accelerated to crash through the roadblock, and immediately rushed forward. The police, seeing this, first fired a warning shot, then started chasing in their car. On the narrow and dark mountain road, [Lin Kai] drove while keeping an eye on the rearview mirror.
0:6:32|0:6:49|At this moment, a police car accelerated and arrived on his right side, while another one ruthlessly crashed into the rear of the car. The three cars maintained a sandwiched appearance and sped forward. Suddenly, the police car on the right forcefully rammed to the left, and in an instant, the front of [Lin Kai]'s car was fiercely pushed onto the roadside curb.
0:6:50|0:7:5|The police pursued relentlessly, once again exerting force, and the left side of [Lin Kai]'s car was directly lifted up, resting on the cement guardrail, continuing to move forward. Just as it was about to flip off the cliff, [Lin Kai] forcefully turned the steering wheel to the right, stepped hard on the gas pedal, and broke free from the restraint.
0:7:6|0:7:17|Who knew, just as he entered the curve, his car was rammed on the left side by a police car, and then pushed towards the edge of the road. In the end, [Lin Kai], along with his car, uncontrollably was pushed off the cliff.
0:7:17|0:7:29|After a cloud of dust settled, the night returned to tranquility. Subsequently, several police officers holding flashlights cautiously slid down the hillside and approached the car of [Lin Kai].
0:7:33|0:7:45|The driver's seat was unexpectedly empty. The scene shifts to a dimly lit lumber mill, where two men are standing on the empty ground.
0:7:55|0:8:2|The man with short hair is roaring angrily at the man with a beard.
0:8:17|0:8:38|The man with short hair, also known as the leader, listened and then squinted at the man with a beard. He then turned away disdainfully, pursed his lips lightly, and spoke. The spotlight shone on the luxurious car behind the leader, and the man with a beard lowered his head in contemplation for a moment.
0:8:38|0:8:58|Stomping his feet in place, he then turned around and walked into the narrow passage behind him. After a while, he came out carrying a leather bag, slowly approaching the leader and unzipping it to show him what was inside. After seeing it, the leader took a step back.
0:9:1|0:9:6|The scene cuts back to the dimly lit room, where [Li Jianguo] is knocked over by a stool.
0:9:15|0:9:24|The man with a beard gritted his teeth and cursed angrily. Yige, also known as the man with a beard, squatted down.
0:9:39|0:9:53|[Li Jianguo] quickly got up, opened the door, and fled in panic. Late at night, Brother Yi gently opened the door and returned home, then dragged his weary body up to the second floor. His wife was sitting on the sofa, looking at him with pain in her eyes.
0:9:55|0:10:3|Yige first looked puzzled towards the room on the left, where he found his daughter sleeping soundly, then turned his head and looked at his wife in confusion.
0:10:6|0:10:11|Suddenly he stopped, at the end of the corridor, [Lin Kai] was devouring noodles hungrily.
0:10:12|0:10:25|Seeing [Li Jianguo] finally recognizing himself, [Lin Kai] slowly put down the bowl, then picked up the gun from the table and played with it. Then, he relaxed and leaned back on the sofa, staring intently at the other person.
0:10:25|0:10:34|Seeing [Lin Kai] looking indifferent, [Li Jianguo] cautiously moved his steps and sat on a chair a few steps away in the deep corridor.
0:10:58|0:11:22|Then, he slowly sat up from the sofa, leaning slightly forward. Next, [Lin Kai] put down the gun in his hand and picked up the small bag next to him, tossing it over. [Li Jianguo] caught it and opened it to take a look, inside was not something else, but exactly the powdery substance that Bin had given [Lin Kai] before.
0:11:22|0:11:38|It seems like drugs now. Seeing this, he raised his eyes in astonishment, then smirked at [Lin Kai]. The scene shifts, it's getting dark, in an abandoned building complex full of garbage and construction materials, a sedan,
0:11:38|0:11:45|Stopped in front of one of the dilapidated buildings. Then, a man wearing glasses got out of the driver's seat,
0:11:46|0:11:55|After looking around, [Lin Kai] walked towards the direction of the building. Inside the spacious and damp building, the ground was covered with puddles and potholes.
0:11:56|0:12:13|At this moment, rain was pouring down from the sky, passing through the abandoned building and hitting the man with glasses directly. As he looked around, a small stone was thrown to his feet. It turned out to be thrown by [Lin Kai] who was crouching on the second floor. [Lin Kai] then approached the man with glasses.
0:12:33|0:12:49|[Lin Kai] sat on a rock, took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, flicked the lighter, lit one, held it in his mouth, took a deep drag, and then stared blankly ahead. Seeing this, [Laoying] slowly squatted down beside him.
0:12:50|0:13:2|After speaking, [Lin Kai] glanced at the man in glasses, who nodded thoughtfully.
0:13:7|0:13:12|He then got into the car of the man with glasses and stopped in front of a shantytown.
0:13:13|0:13:20|After looking around, he bent down, opened the car door, and got out of the car, while the man with glasses was lost in memories.
0:13:29|0:13:37|Lin Kai, dressed in a police uniform, stood opposite him with a resolute and determined expression.
0:13:53|0:14:16|The memory ends, [Lin Kai] has disappeared at the end of the road. The camera shifts, Cheng Yi leads [Lin Kai] into a narrow corridor and arrives at the entrance of a chess room. A man inside notices and walks in. Ying Jie gets up from the table and approaches the two.
0:14:20|0:14:31|On the other side, Yang Bin and his friends were sitting in the car chatting. Suddenly, gunshots were heard not far away. He immediately opened the door and ran.
0:14:33|0:14:48|Cheng Yi then led [Lin Kai] into a vegetable market. He pointed to the vendors and said.
0:14:51|0:14:57|Yang Bin turned into an alley at this moment, saw the police aiming and shot, but was instantly surrounded and shot in the heart.
0:14:58|0:15:4|Cheng Yi led [Lin Kai] towards the depths of the alley, with his subordinates occasionally handing him cigarettes along the way.
0:15:5|0:15:12|On the side, the police officer touched Yang Bin's neck, repeatedly confirming whether he was dead.
0:15:29|0:15:34|Cheng Yi was actually walking around with [Lin Kai] to familiarize himself with the heads of the major strongholds, announcing his official takeover from Yang Bin.
0:15:36|0:15:44|Soon after, [Lin Kai] and [Laoying] arrived at a factory where neatly dressed workers were methodically separating drugs.
0:15:55|0:16:3|The two indulged in revelry in the nightclub.
0:16:8|0:16:15|[Lin Kai] left after receiving the cash, returned to the factory, and carefully inspected the packaged goods. He heard [Li Jianguo] calling his name.
0:16:17|0:16:26|Following him, [Lin Kai] walked towards the depths of the factory. As night fell, a car slowly drove by the riverbank.
0:16:42|0:16:59|[Lin Kai] leaned back in the back seat of the car, speaking to the man in glasses. Hearing this, the man in glasses fell into contemplation. Suddenly, the pained face of his comrade and a tombstone with the name Zhang Haitao entered his mind, but soon, these images disappeared.
0:17:7|0:17:13|[Lin Kai] and his men are eating, drinking, and smoking.
0:17:16|0:17:32|It's as if consciousness has detached. After three rounds of drinks, people gradually went crazy, with someone throwing a large amount of RMB into the air, causing a rain of banknotes in the room. However, [Lin Kai] sat by the bed with a lonely expression, looking at the smoke-filled light and the continuously falling RMB.
0:17:34|0:17:57|He numbly drank alcohol and smoked one cigarette after another, seemingly unaffected by the surrounding excitement. After a while, the drunken people fell asleep in all sorts of positions, some lying on the ground, some slumped in chairs. The only similarity among them was that they all held large amounts of cash in their hands. [Lin Kai] also fell asleep.
0:17:57|0:18:20|He was gasping in pain. In his dream, a young woman curled up her legs, leaned against the chair, clenched her teeth, and injected drugs into her arm through a needle. Suddenly, she began convulsing uncontrollably, breathing rapidly. Accidentally knocking over the table lamp beside her.
0:18:20|0:18:28|At this moment, a young boy hides behind a cabinet, quietly watching the scene in the room, not daring to make a sound.
0:18:29|0:18:38|Seeing the woman suddenly stiffen in her chair, not moving at all, he bit his lip, shuffled his feet, and when he reached her, he couldn't help but cry.
0:18:40|0:19:1|The woman turned out to be the boy's mother. The urgent ringing of the phone woke [Lin Kai] up instantly, and the little boy in the dream disappeared along with it. It turns out that was his childhood.
0:19:2|0:19:28|Lin Kai then turned and picked up the phone beside him. After listening, Lin Kai quickly got up and opened the door slightly, only to see Cheng Yi standing at the door looking at him seriously, and then shouted. Cheng Yi did not respond directly.
0:19:28|0:19:43|Instead, driving with [Lin Kai], arrived at a waste paper compactor station. Slowly, the car stopped in front of a large shovel, and the workers hurried over when they saw it. Then, [Cheng Yi] and [Lin Kai] got out of the car.
0:19:50|0:20:9|[Lin Kai] opened the trunk and suddenly stopped. Inside, there were bundles of US dollars. Seeing the workers skillfully carrying the money away, he stood still, quietly observing. [Cheng Yi] stood in front of the car, watching as the workers carried the money towards the depths of the compactor station. At this moment,
0:20:9|0:20:22|A person approached the machine, tapped on the screen a few times, and the conveyor belt immediately started. A forklift first put the waste paper on the conveyor belt, and then several workers threw bundles of US dollars into the paper pile.
0:20:25|0:20:43|Soon, the two of them disappeared at the end of the conveyor belt. After a while, a huge block of garbage emerged from the machine's exit. [Lin Kai] took a step forward, staring intently at everything, then turned his head and smiled at [Cheng Yi].
0:20:43|0:21:4|At this moment, the machine was still running steadily, while the forklift quietly transported the compressed garbage blocks. Suddenly, [Cheng Yi]'s phone rang. He looked down, then turned around and walked towards the narrow and dim passage behind. With no one around, he answered the call.
0:21:6|0:21:20|Hanging up the phone, [Lin Kai] cautiously looked around, then sent out the words "good weather" via text message. He quickly walked out of the corridor.
0:21:21|0:21:38|After giving instructions to the workers, [Cheng Yi] waved to [Lin Kai]. Then, leading two trucks, they drove away from the waste paper compactor station. Inside the car, [Cheng Yi] looked at the tense-faced [Lin Kai], smiled, and then asked him.
0:21:50|0:21:56|[Cheng Yi] took a deep breath after listening, then turned his head to look at [Lin Kai] and smiled with relief.
0:21:56|0:22:18|At this moment, the convoy arrived at the railway transportation transfer station. Among the densely packed piles of goods, [Cheng Yi] found a vacant space and slowly parked the car there. The two large trucks behind them stopped not far away. After speaking to [Lin Kai] who followed him, Cheng Yi then walked towards the small building inside the transfer station.
0:22:19|0:22:42|[Lin Kai] then lowered his head and lit a cigarette, standing in place to survey the area. At this moment, Cheng Yi arrived at the warehouse door and looked inside. Shortly after, there was a commotion behind them. Two cars and a truck drove through the containers towards the two of them. Shockingly, the police were ambushing from a vantage point.
0:22:43|0:22:50|In a boxcar at the transfer station, the leader from earlier was deploying the operation with a walkie-talkie.
0:22:52|0:23:9|Looking at the real-time monitoring on the screen, the leader saw the three cars passing by Cheng Yi and [Lin Kai], and stopped directly in front of the warehouse. Then, the man with a headscarf and a gloomy expression in the leading car opened the door first and got out.
0:23:9|0:23:36|Upon seeing the situation, Cheng Yi hurried forward, bending at the waist, warmly greeting him. When Luo Zong got out of the car, he furrowed his brow and stared at [Lin Kai]. Cheng Yi quickly put on a smile and explained to him.
0:23:52|0:24:8|After Mr. Luo finished listening, he nodded to one of his subordinates, indicating something. Then, [Lin Kai] led the subordinates to the side of the large truck, and had someone use a cutting machine to cut off a corner of the garbage block, revealing a bundle of US dollars.
0:24:8|0:24:16|Not far away, the police camera captured the entire process of the transaction between the two parties and the stolen money clearly.
0:24:17|0:24:26|Hearing that there are 28 packs of US dollars, [Laoying] signaled to his subordinates again. Then, his group of men uncovered the plastic sheet on the big truck.
0:24:29|0:24:43|At this moment, several large logs appeared in the carriage. A henchman used an electric saw to cut a rectangular hole from the top. After moving the cut-off wood pieces away, neatly packaged drugs were unexpectedly arranged inside.
0:24:44|0:24:56|At this moment, the henchman took out a package and threw it to [Lin Kai] standing by the car. After looking at it in his hand, [Lin Kai] immediately walked towards Cheng Yi and handed it to him.
0:24:58|0:25:6|Cheng Yi joyfully reached out his right hand, and the leader at this moment picked up the walkie-talkie.
0:25:7|0:25:26|In the boxcar, the police officers leaped up and rushed out. The sirens blared, causing the subordinates to scatter in fear. Director Luo quickly got on the car under the cover of his subordinates. Taking advantage of the scuffle between [Lin Kai] and his subordinates, Director Luo and Cheng Yi hurriedly escaped. At this moment, the police stopped the large truck.
0:25:27|0:25:32|As soon as [Lin Kai] drove out of the exit, he found himself surrounded by police cars in the front and back.
0:25:33|0:25:51|On the other side, Cheng Yi, upon seeing the police approaching in the car, suddenly turned the steering wheel and abandoned the car, then ran into the container group. Immediately, the police started shooting and chased after him. [Lin Kai] was wrestling with his subordinates, and upon seeing the police, immediately crawled under the police car.
0:26:35|0:26:52|After knocking down one of the police officers, he immediately dodged. Unexpectedly, just as he passed through an intersection, he ran into four police officers head-on. With no other choice, he had to turn back and hide in a crevice. Then he took out a hand grenade he carried with him and threw it at the feet of the police officers.
0:26:52|0:27:12|The deafening explosion and dazzling fire immediately caught the attention of [Lin Kai]. As Luo Zong tried to escape in the chaos, he was hit in the right calf. He then threw another grenade at the police. Following the explosion, [Lin Kai] approached Luo Zong and urgently said.
0:27:14|0:27:31|After identifying the incoming person, Boss Luo put away the gun and immediately got into the back seat of the car. Subsequently, [Lin Kai] accelerated out of the pile of goods, but unfortunately, the police car behind was still in hot pursuit. At this moment, another police car turned into the intersection ahead.
0:27:31|0:27:43|Seeing that he was about to be surrounded, [Lin Kai] suddenly turned the steering wheel and drove into the warehouse. In the chaos, the vehicle knocked down the goods along the way, while the police kept shooting from behind.
0:27:46|0:28:8|Soon, [Lin Kai] drove the vehicle crashing through the gate, landing on the railway tracks and swerving away crookedly. A leader, who appeared out of nowhere, was now wearing a police cap, looking in the direction where [Lin Kai] was escaping, and let out a deep sigh. Inside the car, Manager Luo was pointing a gun at the back of [Lin Kai]'s head while tending to the wound.
0:28:10|0:28:16|[Lin Kai] disdainfully glared at Manager Luo. Manager Luo ignored him.
0:28:17|0:28:25|Taking off the scarf around his neck, [Lin Kai] tightly wrapped it around his calf. After pausing for a moment, he then took out his phone from his pocket and made a call.
0:28:27|0:28:42|After the call connected, he shouted at the other party to come to the riverbank to pick him up after the accident. Soon, they arrived at the riverbank. [Lin Kai] followed suit, stopped the car. As he got out of the car and stood still, he turned around and saw,
0:28:42|0:29:3|Mr. Luo leaned against the door, still pointing the gun at himself. Looking at the loaded gun, [Lin Kai] felt helpless and had to comply. So, he walked step by step towards the direction of the river. Mr. Luo, seeing this, limped along behind him, holding the gun, maintaining a distance of three steps.
0:29:3|0:29:13|At this moment, the sky is already bright. In the murky river water, Luo Zong is holding [Lin Kai] hostage, making him carry him on his back and swim to the other side.
0:29:14|0:29:34|He held a gun in one hand and tightly embraced [Lin Kai]'s neck with the other, putting all his weight on top. Finally, the two of them swam to the shore. Luo Zong groaned in pain because of his wound. Under threat, [Lin Kai] supported him and they arrived at the dense jungle on the side. Then, they both collapsed from exhaustion.
0:29:35|0:29:57|During a moment of catching his breath, a rustling sound could be heard. As [Lin Kai] just opened his eyes, he saw a person approaching him with a gun. Before he could even get up, he was knocked unconscious. Later, a group of people arrived at the notorious Golden Triangle area. [Lin Kai] was blindfolded, his hands and feet tied, and thrown into the back of a vehicle.
0:29:57|0:30:7|In the front row, a woman wearing sunglasses occasionally looked back at him, then picked up the walkie-talkie and made a call.
0:30:14|0:30:23|After a brief response from the father of the woman in sunglasses, he hung up the phone. The camera then zoomed out to reveal that he was actually sitting in a room that looked like a prison.
0:30:24|0:30:44|On the exquisite redwood table, neatly arranged tea sets are placed. He picked up a bowl of hot water, tilted his head back and drank it all in one gulp. At this moment, a group of people led by the woman in sunglasses arrived at the lumber factory deep in the forest. [Lin Kai] was blindfolded and thrown to the ground. Soon after, two cars slowly drove up the narrow road from deep within the forest.
0:30:47|0:31:10|Shortly after, the car stopped in front of the gate of the lumber factory. Seeing this, the subordinates stood up straight to greet. Boss Luo, with a cigarette in his mouth, sat on a wooden stake, wiping his gun. At this moment, his fully armed men respectfully opened the car's back door, and a middle-aged man wearing a straw hat, waving a handkerchief, got out of the car. The woman in sunglasses stood up straight and went to meet him.
0:31:10|0:31:30|It turns out, he is the father of the woman in sunglasses. Ignoring Li Jianguo who approached him, he played with the matches in his hand and walked straight towards Lin Kai. Then, he sat directly on the chair opposite Lin Kai. His two henchmen stood behind him obediently.
0:31:48|0:31:55|The father of [Mo Jing] reached back and took the gun.
0:32:9|0:32:22|The father of the woman in sunglasses aimed a gun at [Lin Kai], seemingly contemplating something. Then, he leisurely stood up, and his two subordinates immediately grabbed [Lin Kai] and pressed him in front of him.
0:32:27|0:32:33|As soon as the words fell, the father of the woman in sunglasses emptied the bullets in the gun, leaving only one.
0:32:41|0:32:56|The trigger was pulled, but nothing happened the next second. Watching [Lin Kai] curl up into a ball, Sunglasses Dad raised an eyebrow and fired several more times in a row.
0:32:57|0:33:3|The father of the woman in sunglasses asked with a smile. [Lin Kai] responded through gritted teeth.
0:33:7|0:33:23|Shortly after, the father of the woman in sunglasses signaled to the men holding [Lin Kai]. [Lin Kai] was immediately dragged away. Seeing this, Manager Luo dropped the cigarette in his mouth, limped over to the father of the woman in sunglasses.
0:33:36|0:33:55|The woman in sunglasses, also known as [Qingshui], nodded after listening, then carefully glanced at Luo Dongfang. Seeing this, [Qingshui]'s father vigorously wiped Luo Dongfang's neck with a handkerchief, then turned and left. Before the sun set, Lin Kai...
0:33:55|0:34:8|[Lin Kai] was taken by [Qingshui] and Luo Dongfang in a car, and immediately headed towards the Chinese border. On a fresh morning in Yunlai City, a large number of police and journalists gathered inside the factory.
0:34:27|0:34:50|The leader who has a secret deal with Cheng Yi is now speaking in front of the public. His subordinates are lighting torches in front of the reporters to destroy the drugs. Looking at the leader on the stage, the man with glasses whispers instructions to his colleague. At this moment, Lin Kai and two others drive to the entrance of a vegetable market.
0:35:0|0:35:6|Later, looking at the expressions of [Qingshui] and [Luo Dongfang], he proposed this plan.
0:35:8|0:35:18|Sitting in the back seat, [Luo Dongfang] listened and then leaned forward to threaten him. However, [Lin Kai] ignored him and got out of the car, walking straight into the market.
0:35:18|0:35:35|At this moment, the man wearing a hat was trading with a vegetable vendor, exchanging drugs for money. After pocketing the drug proceeds, he took out a notebook he carried with him and started jotting something down. Just as he put the notebook back in his bag, he turned around and saw [Lin Kai].
0:35:36|0:35:44|[Lin Kai] ignored it and took the notebook. Then, he tore out a page.
0:36:11|0:36:26|[Lin Kai] just slipped a note into Xiaobei's shirt pocket and secretly took his phone. Inside the police station, the phone of the man with glasses rang, and he abruptly pulled open a drawer to reveal the least used emergency phone.
0:36:33|0:36:38|[Lin Kai] didn't wait for the phone to be answered, he pushed Xiaobei to the ground and returned the phone in one swift motion.
0:36:55|0:37:7|On the narrow road, [Cheng Yi] driving a luxury car suddenly received a phone call. Hearing the continuous ringing, he lowered his head to pick up the phone from the seat, glanced at it, and then answered the call.
0:37:11|0:37:24|As soon as the words fell, Lin Kai's car was violently hit from behind. Then, Laoying's men with guns arrived at the side of Lin Kai's car and forcefully dragged him out of the driver's seat.
0:37:25|0:37:34|[Luo Dongfang] took his phone from the seat. Seeing [Cheng Yi] pinned in the back seat of his car, [Lin Kai] stepped on the gas pedal and accelerated out.
0:37:35|0:37:42|Listening to the frightened gasps of [Cheng Yi], [Luo Dongfang] sitting beside him spoke.
0:38:9|0:38:17|Qingshui listened and then dialed Wang Bo's number, and then handed the phone to Cheng Yi.
0:38:24|0:38:36|With a gun pointed at his forehead, [Cheng Yi] could only comply. The scene shifts to an abandoned building where [Cheng Yi] and [Wang Bo] are hanging, with broken glass beneath their feet.
0:39:34|0:39:42|[Luo Dongfang] suddenly raised his hand and shot towards [Cheng Yi]'s thigh. Then, he walked up to [Wang Bo] with a phone in hand and pressed the play button.
0:39:56|0:40:2|Upon finishing speaking, [Lin Kai] slowly raised the muzzle and aimed at the side of [Laoying]'s face.
0:40:12|0:40:23|[Luo Dongfang] took back the gun, turned around, and looked at the coughing [Cheng Yi]. [Cheng Yi] answered cautiously.
0:40:24|0:40:46|Next, Laodongfang fired continuously, and Cheng Yi suddenly fell silent. At this moment, one of Laodongfang's men quietly approached Lin Kai from behind. Just as Wang Bo breathed a sigh of relief, he saw Laodongfang pointing in Lin Kai's direction. The man who had just approached immediately raised his gun and moved forward to confront Lin Kai.
0:40:47|0:41:3|Who knew, [Lin Kai] dodged and used his body to block Luo Dongfang's shots. Then, he quickly took care of the others and hid behind a cement pillar. At this moment, Luo Dongfang and [Qingshui], who were hiding behind their respective cement pillars, signaled each other with their eyes.
0:41:3|0:41:15|Lin Kai was the first to step forward, while Qingshui took a shot from the other side. They coordinated their attack, walking out from behind the pillar one after the other, strolling in Lin Kai's direction.
0:41:16|0:41:24|Seeing that Luo Dongfang was about to approach the cement pillar where [Lin Kai] was hiding, suddenly, [Lin Kai] noticed several gas tanks on the open space diagonally ahead.
0:41:25|0:41:43|After several consecutive shots, multiple leaking gas tanks spun and flew towards the corner where Lin Kai was standing. Lin Kai reacted quickly, crouched down and fired again. The explosion directly sent Luo Dongfang flying out. Then, seizing the opportunity, Lin Kai pursued him and shot him in the shoulder while he was unable to get up.
0:41:43|0:41:48|Later, [Laoying] approached [Qingshui] from behind and disarmed her of her pistol.
0:41:51|0:41:59|[Rodongfang] lay on the ground, clutching his wound, while [Lin Kai] threatened [Qingshui] with a gun.
0:42:0|0:42:15|[Lin Kai] did not answer, but pushed the muzzle forward again. Helplessly, [Qingshui] took out his phone, dialed a number, and handed it to [Lin Kai] behind him. His father's voice came through the phone.
0:42:32|0:42:55|Continuing, he calmly agreed to Lin Kai's conditions and hung up the phone first. Inside the building, Laoying held his injured shoulder, sweating profusely. Then, under Lin Kai's coercion, the three of them left. The scene shifted to a man eating instant noodles in the dormitory.
0:42:58|0:43:2|After the man with glasses was stripped naked by several police officers, they carefully searched his personal belongings.
0:43:24|0:43:35|After taking the note, Lin Kai found only a scribbled "wait" on it, so he nodded knowingly. On the other side,
0:43:39|0:43:53|He held a gun against the back of [Lin Kai]'s head, forcing him to drive obediently, while observing the surroundings. As they entered a dense forest, suddenly, he realized that his phone had completely lost signal, and he looked out the window.
0:43:53|0:44:11|There were many signal jammers covered with leaves not far away. At this moment, [Qingshui]'s father waved a handkerchief and walked into the lumber factory, followed by many henchmen holding guns. [Lin Kai] then pointed a gun at [Luo Dongfang] and looked at him quietly.
0:44:12|0:44:19|[Qingshui]'s father stood opposite [Lin Kai], casually waving the handkerchief in his hand, gently creating a breeze.
0:44:27|0:44:33|Qingshui's father lowered his head and smiled.
0:44:42|0:44:53|[Lin Kai] held a gun against [Laoying] as a threat, then smiled and looked at [Qingshui]'s father. [Laoying] hung his head in guilt.
0:45:6|0:45:13|Qingshui's father listened, one hand supporting the chair, the other using a handkerchief to cover his nose and sniffed, then said.
0:45:42|0:46:2|At this moment, [Lin Kai] suddenly smirked, turned the gun, pointing it at [Qingshui]'s father. Then, he loosened his right hand and handed the gun over. After [Qingshui]'s father took it, he forcefully aimed at Luo Dongfang's forehead, then walked over to [Qingshui].
0:46:8|0:46:23|After explaining with tears in his eyes, he turned around and returned to [Lin Kai], reaching out to forcefully slap him to the ground. The scene then shifts to the hospital. The man in glasses, accompanied by a few henchmen, walks through the corridor and enters Wang Bo's hospital room.
0:46:26|0:46:31|Then he showed his police officer badge to him. It turned out that his name was [Li Jianguo].
0:46:34|0:46:41|On the other side, [Qingshui]'s father, accompanied by two henchmen, arrived at the second floor of the lumber factory, then walked up to [Lin Kai].
0:46:42|0:47:3|At this moment, [Lin Kai] was tied to a chair, his limbs hanging limp, his skin torn and bleeding. Then, [Qingshui]'s father raised his hand as a signal, and his men immediately lifted a bucket of water and poured it over [Lin Kai]. The additional stimulation immediately brought [Lin Kai] back to consciousness, as he lifted his head and weakly swayed.
0:47:4|0:47:16|[Qingshui]'s father sat across and asked. Water kept flowing down [Lin Kai]'s injured cheek, but he just spat out a mouthful of water without saying a word.
0:47:17|0:47:42|Shortly after, [Qingshui]'s father gestured again, and a henchman immediately brought a piece of cloth to cover [Lin Kai]'s face. Another person poured wine into his mouth and nose. After the cloth was removed, [Lin Kai] continued to vomit out the wine. [Qingshui]'s father leaned forward, fanned the air with a handkerchief, and then spoke again.
0:48:18|0:48:34|[Qingshui]'s father gritted his teeth and walked away after speaking, while his men swarmed in and covered [Lin Kai] with a cloth again, pouring alcohol over him. [Lin Kai] struggled incessantly, but his limbs were firmly held down. [Qingshui] looked on with pity from the side.
0:48:35|0:48:44|At this moment, [Qingshui]'s father knelt in front of the Buddha hall. Looking at the portrait of the woman in the Buddha hall, he said contentedly.
0:48:45|0:48:50|The scene shifts to a wooden house by the river. [Lin Kai] is lying unconscious on the floor.
0:48:51|0:49:11|In a haze, he seemed to see an old man walking towards him. The man held a tray, squatted down beside [Lin Kai], placed things on the ground, lifted [Lin Kai]'s arm, tied a rubber tube around it. After tapping a few times to find the vein, he pulled out the syringe and injected medication into his arm.
0:49:12|0:49:17|The scene before him became chaotic, and [Lin Kai] was lost in memories.
0:49:30|0:49:49|There is also a scene of police training. Multiple images constantly interweave, and [Lin Kai] faints in pain. When he wakes up again, it is already night, and inside the room, the fan is still swaying from side to side. [Lin Kai] lies quietly on the ground.
0:49:50|0:49:59|A little girl first helped him remove the gauze from his arm and clean the wound. Then, she re-bandaged his arm with new gauze.
0:50:0|0:50:18|After the old man helped him up, the girl held a bowl and slowly fed [Lin Kai]. Meanwhile, [Qingshui]'s father was sitting in a room decorated like a prison cell, smoking next to a warm table lamp. A prominent photo of him kissing a beautiful woman in his younger days hung on the wall.
0:50:19|0:50:44|Upon closer inspection, the latter is the woman he referred to as Yunan in the Buddha Hall. On the other side, seeing Lin Kai fall asleep again, the old man once again tied his arms with a rubber tube, then scooped a spoonful of powdered substance from a large jar and mixed it into the medicine. Next, he pulled out a syringe and slowly pushed it into his arm.
0:50:44|0:50:50|[Lin Kai] seemed to realize something, he furrowed his brow and slowly opened his eyes.
0:50:51|0:51:6|But he just mechanically blinked, his eyes dull and unfocused, then he tilted his head and fell into a deep sleep. In the blink of an eye, it was morning.
0:51:19|0:51:36|Seeing that [Lin Kai] was awake, and noticing the car parked on the other side of the river, the old man helped him onto the boat and brought him across. [Lin Kai] looked around at his surroundings, but soon he was grabbed by two men and pulled off the boat.
0:51:36|0:51:45|Qingshui, who was originally sitting in the car, saw Lin Kai approaching and immediately opened the door, got out of the car, circled behind him, and blindfolded his eyes with a cloth.
0:51:46|0:51:54|After leaving the riverbank, the car arrived at a bustling market, drove through the crowded crowd, and continued to move forward.
0:51:56|0:52:1|Informants planted by [Qingshui]'s father are stationed all over the market, silently watching the direction the car is heading.
0:52:2|0:52:20|Blindfolded [Lin Kai] could only rely on his hearing to sense the surrounding noise, while [Qingshui] sat next to him expressionless. The car then arrived at the outskirts and slowly turned into a school. In the empty classroom, [Qingshui]'s father was loudly asking the children who wanted to play with him.
0:52:38|0:52:54|As [Qingshui] led [Lin Kai] in, the children cheered and surrounded [Qingshui]. [Qingshui]'s father sat nonchalantly in a chair, fanning himself back and forth, watching it all. Then, the three of them walked into the school cafeteria.
0:52:54|0:53:14|The children immediately stopped cleaning when they saw [Qingshui] leading the way, and approached her. [Qingshui]'s father then proudly said to [Lin Kai]. He then gestured for [Lin Kai] to sit across from him.
0:53:42|0:53:50|[Lin Kai] suddenly yawned heavily. [Qingshui]'s father then took a deep breath with a handkerchief.
0:53:58|0:54:11|[Qingshui]'s father listened with great interest and looked at him. Meanwhile, [Lin Kai] couldn't help but yawn again.
0:54:26|0:54:41|At this moment, [Lin Kai] uncomfortably moved his shoulder. Seeing this, [Qingshui]'s father reached out his right hand to him, and as soon as they shook hands, he forcefully pulled [Lin Kai] towards himself. Then, looking into his eyes, he softly said.
0:54:46|0:54:51|[Lin Kai] listened, his eyes widening in shock, his breathing becoming more rapid.
0:54:52|0:54:58|Later, he remembered the scene where the old man injected himself with a syringe in the wooden house by the river.
0:55:6|0:55:15|[Lin Kai] looked at the object in his hand, his whole face starting to tremble uncontrollably. Meanwhile, [Qingshui]'s father nonchalantly turned and walked away.
0:55:16|0:55:36|In order to stop his desire to take drugs, [Lin Kai] frantically hits his head, accidentally flinging the drugs away. Then, he tightly grips the table with both hands, trying to control himself. But the next moment, he acts like an unconscious puppet, standing up and searching for the drugs he flung away.
0:55:36|0:55:57|In a flurry of movement, the stools in the cafeteria and the utensils on the table were left in disarray. It was late at night, and the dormitory was quiet, with the children all sleeping soundly. In the next room, [Lin Kai] sat at the table with a piece of paper, drawing something. As he drew, he sniffled, forcing himself to concentrate.
0:55:59|0:56:17|On the way to school, Lin Kai kept tapping and counting with his hands and feet, and based on this, he drew a map on paper. However, the drug addiction made him breathe rapidly, and even the muscles on his face twitched. Therefore, he could only cover his head with his hands and force himself to focus.
0:56:17|0:56:39|At this moment, the paper in front of him became increasingly blurred, as if the words and patterns were walking down from above. [Lin Kai] clenched his hands tightly, trying hard to keep himself calm, but he couldn't hold back. On the bedside table, the package of drugs given by [Qingshui]'s father seemed to be magnified, making it easy for him to lock onto it with just a turn of his head.
0:56:40|0:56:52|But he forced himself to turn back, trembling as he took out two cigarettes and put them in his mouth. Just as he had taken two puffs, he looked at the small packet of drugs again. Finally, he turned around and clenched the items in his hand.
0:56:53|0:57:0|Staring at his fist for a moment, he then tapped his head again before tossing the drugs to the ground with a flick of his hand.
0:57:1|0:57:8|Then, he suddenly stood up, picked up the water pitcher and poured water into the cup. After finishing it in one gulp, he paced anxiously in the room.
0:57:10|0:57:26|At this moment, he saw a bundle of hemp rope and immediately used it to tie his hands, securing them to the head of the bed. In a daze, as he curled up on the bed, he saw a stick figure drawn with chalk on the wall not far away, walking down.
0:57:28|0:57:40|Then floating in the air, it transformed into the appearance of [Qingshui]'s father. [Lin Kai] was so scared that he shivered, and then he saw him waving a handkerchief and walking towards his direction.
0:57:49|0:58:5|Turning his head, [Lin Kai] saw [Li Jianguo] again, and then his mother appeared. Seeing his mother, he couldn't help but burst into tears. His mother then smiled, slowly approached, and sat beside him.
0:58:15|0:58:40|Looking at the suffering Lin Kai, his mother gently pats his back and then slowly nestles her head into his neck. Lin Kai cries like a child. But all of this is just Lin Kai's fantasy, the person holding him is not his mother, but Qingshui.
0:58:41|0:58:57|Seeing [Lin Kai] release himself, [Qingshui] unscrewed the medicine bottle and dripped a few drops of medicine by his lips. Then, she gently wiped his forehead with a towel. Soon, [Lin Kai] held onto her arms and gradually stopped struggling.
0:58:58|0:59:1|Upon seeing this, [Qingshui] wiped away the tears of pain from [Lin Kai]'s eyes.
0:59:2|0:59:20|It was as if she really took herself as his mother, gently stroking and patting him. Finally, [Lin Kai] fell into a deep sleep. And [Qingshui] sat by his side, accompanying him through the whole night. The next day, [Lin Kai] woke up drenched in sweat.
0:59:20|0:59:39|He blinked in confusion, turned his head, and found the hemp rope used to tie himself up last night on the pillow. Then he looked towards the head of the bed and saw the drugs still there, sighing. At the desk, [Qingshui] was tidying up the paintbrushes on the table.
0:59:39|0:59:56|[Lin Kai] then slowly approached her, asking in confusion. [Qingshui] stopped what she was doing, didn't answer the question, but stood up and walked past him towards the direction of the stairs. [Lin Kai] stared at her intently, then turned to look at her back.
0:59:57|1:0:12|After walking a distance, Qingshui suddenly stopped in his tracks and took out a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket. He then turned around and approached Lin Kai, holding up the paper ball.
1:0:13|1:0:31|Lin Kai immediately threw it to [Lin Kai] and left without looking back. Watching [Qingshui] who had already walked far away, [Lin Kai] opened the paper ball and was surprised to find that it was the map he had drawn. At noon, two cars drove through the winding forest road and moved forward.
1:0:31|1:0:48|[Lin Kai] sat in the back seat of the second car, with [Qingshui] sitting next to him, looking out the window expressionlessly. At this moment, [Lin Kai] noticed that the GPS on the car had been malfunctioning all along. After driving for a while like this, the convoy entered a hidden factory.
1:0:48|1:0:59|[Lin Kai] looked out through the window without making a sound. Downstairs in the factory, workers were processing the drug ingredients methodically.
1:1:0|1:1:7|[Qingshui] led [Lin Kai] through the crowd to the second floor. After lifting the door curtain, [Lin Kai] was instantly stunned.
1:1:8|1:1:24|In front of them appeared a three-story high greenhouse cultivation frame, growing the raw material of drugs, poppy flowers. Next to the flowers were not only a humidifier and a detector, but also guards armed with guns patrolling the aisle.
1:1:33|1:1:40|[Qingshui]'s father walked up to [Lin Kai] and showed off. [Lin Kai] leaned on the railing and responded.
1:1:52|1:2:7|The two then exchanged a smile, but soon after, [Qingshui]'s father looked back at the training frame, the smile on his face disappearing in an instant. The scene shifted back to Yunlai City, where [Lin Kai] was driving a car, carrying [Qingshui] forward. In the background,
1:2:7|1:2:23|Qingshui's younger brother drove the second car closely behind. Suddenly, Lin Kai noticed from the rearview mirror that a small car was attempting to overtake behind Qingshui's younger brother's car. He then took out a cigarette and put it in his mouth.
1:2:23|1:2:31|Next, he took out a lighter and lit it. [Qingshui] sitting beside him, impatiently rolled down the passenger window.
1:2:32|1:2:42|[Lin Kai] noticed behind him and also closed the window on his side. Then, he casually rested the hand holding the cigarette on the car door outside.
1:2:44|1:3:0|It turned out that in the car was [Li Jianguo], who took off his glasses, took out binoculars to observe carefully, and then discovered that [Lin Kai] was hiding and systematically tapping the car body. [Li Jianguo] immediately instructed his colleagues.
1:3:2|1:3:18|Then he casually glanced back. At this moment, the car accelerated and brushed past [Lin Kai]. As [Li Jianguo] drove parallel to him, he unintentionally rolled down the window. In the warehouse, a truck filled with logs slowly started and drove forward.
1:3:18|1:3:40|In the hotel, [Wang Bo] curled up on the bed, his hands handcuffed. Soon, plainclothes police officers woke him up, unlocked the handcuffs, and took him out of the room. On the other side, [Lin Kai] brought [Qingshui] to a dilapidated building, walked through winding and narrow corridors, and finally met [Wang Bo] holding a file bag.
1:3:41|1:3:49|At the border crossing, [Lin Kai] and [Qingshui] were stopped with a large truck carrying logs.
1:3:50|1:4:4|But when the armed police saw the permit, they immediately stamped it and let it pass. Later, the convoy arrived at a wood processing factory, where workers were continuously extracting drugs with the Double Eagle logo from the logs.
1:4:5|1:4:16|On the other side, [Qingshui] was watching as the workers loaded bundles of US dollars onto the truck. Then, he opened a nearby box and started counting the number of gold bars inside.
1:4:17|1:4:29|A few days later, [Lin Kai] once again brought the convoy to Yunlai City. This time, he made a deal with Xiaobei to transport drugs using trucks first, and then bring back cash to the Golden Triangle as before.
1:4:30|1:4:43|After exchanging the truck keys, [Lin Kai] left with his men first. Then, [Li Jianguo] slowly walked out from deep inside the factory, glanced at Xiaobei, and took out his phone from his pocket.
1:4:44|1:4:58|In the hotel, [Lin Kai] and two others quickly ate instant noodles and fell asleep. In the middle of the night, while he was sleeping soundly, he suddenly broke out in a cold sweat, his face twitching unnaturally. Obviously, this was a drug withdrawal.
1:4:59|1:5:21|So, in the midst of rapid breathing, he slowly woke up from a deep sleep. Just as he opened his groggy eyes, he saw wisps of smoke seeping in from under the hotel door. Before he could react, he fell back asleep. Suddenly, the door was gently pushed open, and then two people found [Lin Kai] and carried him out.
1:5:21|1:5:44|In the room, all the people including [Qingshui] were completely unaware. At this moment, [Lin Kai] was being forced into a water tank, the suffocation quickly brought him back to his senses. Then, he suddenly lifted his head. To his surprise, he could hear words of concern. Turning abruptly, [Lin Kai] found [Li Jianguo] standing beside him.
1:5:45|1:5:55|After that, he took the towel thrown to him and casually wiped his wet hair. Upon hearing this, [Lin Kai] stopped the action of drying his hair.
1:6:8|1:6:27|In a fit of rage, [Lin Kai] slammed the towel hard on the ground. Water trickled down his wet hair into his eyes, but he paid no attention, glaring fiercely at [Li Jianguo]. Seeing this, [Li Jianguo] slowly bent down, picked up the towel, and threw it back into [Lin Kai]'s hands.
1:6:29|1:6:39|After speaking, [Lin Kai] ran his hand through his hair, took big strides past [Li Jianguo], and walked to the edge of the rooftop. Then, [Li Jianguo] stepped forward and stood shoulder to shoulder with him.
1:7:14|1:7:23|[Li Jianguo] furrowed his brow, looking extremely shocked. After sighing, he explained to [Lin Kai].
1:7:47|1:7:54|In the woods, the car suddenly overturned, and [Li Jianguo] was thrown out directly.
1:7:57|1:8:3|In the car, his comrade [Zhang Haitao] hadn't climbed out yet when the whole car exploded directly.
1:8:4|1:8:10|Seeing the sorrowful and indignant Li Jianguo, Lin Kai stepped forward and asked solemnly.
1:8:16|1:8:30|After a moment of contemplation, [Li Jianguo] put on his glasses and spoke again.
1:8:40|1:8:59|[Lin Kai] sniffed, solemnly responded, then glanced at [Li Jianguo] before quickly leaving the rooftop. Everything was peaceful as they returned to the Golden Triangle. At that moment, [Lin Kai] was sitting outside the solemn temple, smoking one cigarette after another. Soon after, he was led into the temple by [Qingshui].
1:8:59|1:9:7|At this moment, the monk begins to pray. May the Buddha transform misfortune and eliminate illness.
1:9:17|1:9:25|To obtain longevity, beauty, happiness, and health. At this moment, the monk clasped his hands together and bowed deeply to the Buddha statue.
1:9:27|1:9:45|Turning around, indicating that everyone could now present the flower garland. The crowd first bowed to [Qingshui]'s father who was standing at the front of the line. Then, they gradually left the Buddhist hall. Seeing this, [Qingshui] silently walked up to the Buddha statue, gazing at the portrait of Yanan on the edge of the garland.
1:9:45|1:9:53|She looked deeply, then clasped her hands together, closed her eyes, and bowed sincerely. [Lin Kai] stood curiously behind.
1:9:55|1:10:7|At this moment, [Qingshui]'s father came to his side, looking at the memorial tablet, and slowly spoke. Looking at the photo of Yunan, he smiled gently.
1:10:8|1:10:15|Turning around, he fixed his gaze on [Lin Kai] with a sudden change in his eyes.
1:10:17|1:10:44|Qingshui's father listened, moved his burned left ear, then turned to look at Yunan, curled his lips, smiled mysteriously, and slowly walked towards the Buddha hall. Lin Kai watched his back, lost in thought. That night, he followed Qingshui to a spiral stone staircase.
1:10:44|1:11:1|Continuing on, they walked slowly downwards. Through the dim light on the wall, [Lin Kai] discovered that it was an underground base built with rocks. At that moment, [Qingshui] opened a door, and the two entered a place resembling a dungeon.
1:11:1|1:11:8|Next, [Qingshui] stopped in front of a gun-wielding guard, nodded slightly, and another door was pulled open.
1:11:10|1:11:22|Dad [Qingshui], dressed in a suit, is sitting at the head of the long table, drinking red wine. As [Lin Kai] enters the room, the iron door behind him immediately closes.
1:11:34|1:11:56|[Lin Kai] looked at the inquiring eyes of the elders, calmly met their gaze, and nodded politely. After speaking, [Qingshui]'s father wiped his mouth with a napkin, then stood up and walked towards [Lin Kai].
1:12:6|1:12:19|Lin Kai, with his shoulder embraced by Qingshui's father, looked meaningfully at him. The elders burst into laughter after hearing Li Jianguo's words that Laoying was actually Qingshui's father. At this moment,
1:12:19|1:12:26|He turned around and pulled out a chair for [Lin Kai], letting him sit down, and personally poured a glass of red wine that had already been prepared.
1:12:52|1:13:0|[Laoying] swayed the wine glass, walked to the table, and then took out a small bag of powder to show to the elders.
1:13:34|1:13:43|The elder in a suit unexpectedly refused directly. [Laoying], after swallowing a piece of pizza with interest, leisurely made his way back to his seat.
1:14:14|1:14:30|[Laoying] interrupted him, stood up, and used a fork to put the food into the plate in front of him. After leisurely placing the napkin on his lap, he lowered his head and started eating by himself. Soon after, the dinner table fell into a dead silence.
1:14:32|1:14:44|The scene shifts, and the flock of birds loses its direction due to the interference of the solar disruptor. Then, Lin Kai, in a suit, braves the scorching sun and arrives at a rooftop in the town.
1:14:47|1:14:56|[Laoying] seemed oblivious and picked up the poppies drying in the bamboo basket to smell. [Lin Kai] followed [Qingshui] through the corridor and arrived at the second floor hallway.
1:14:59|1:15:12|Just as he was about to go upstairs, Lin Kai saw the elder in a suit falling headfirst onto the terrace. After a burst of intense gunfire, he lay there lifeless. Qingshui watched and urged Li Jianguo.
1:15:13|1:15:19|[Laoying] stood at the edge of the rooftop, looking at the body, and wiped his face with a handkerchief. [Qingshui] called out to [Laoying].
1:15:24|1:15:31|[Laoying] turned around and pointed at [Lin Kai]. After speaking, [Laoying] gestured for [Lin Kai] to come forward.
1:15:48|1:15:58|Laoying flicks his handkerchief, gesturing for Lin Kai to come to his side.
1:16:10|1:16:14|After speaking, he paused for a moment and then turned around, his gaze fixed on the distant town.
1:16:23|1:16:31|[Laoying] said firmly. [Laoying] looked up at the sky, then covered his eyes with a handkerchief.
1:16:32|1:16:41|After giving orders to [Lin Kai], [Qingshui] walked straight past him and down the rooftop. [Lin Kai] turned around in confusion, only to see [Laoying] hurriedly leaving.
1:16:42|1:16:59|So he had to follow and ended up in the underground base. At this moment, [Laoying] stopped at the door of a cell, waited for the guard to leave, and decisively closed the small window on the door. The half-naked man inside immediately shrank into the corner upon hearing the noise.
1:17:0|1:17:10|His hair was all gone, covered in burns, [Lin Kai] looked inside in disbelief.
1:17:32|1:17:45|In the memory, [Li Jianguo], [Laoying], and the pregnant Yunan were busy in the drug manufacturing factory. After the explosion, half of the factory wall was blown up, and fully armed police quickly rushed in.
1:17:45|1:18:5|Laoying hurried to support his wife and, escorted by two drug dealers, ran towards the door. They were about to get in the car and leave when they heard Li Jianguo's warning voice behind them. The couple was shocked, so they turned around and stared at him intently.
1:18:6|1:18:25|Li Jianguo took out two drug dealers first, then hit Laoying's right shoulder with a blow. Unexpectedly, Yunan immediately counterattacked and hit his left arm. At this moment, Li Jianguo lost his balance, fell backwards, accidentally pulled the trigger, and the bullet pierced through Yunan's chest instantly.
1:18:25|1:18:35|[Laoying] dropped the gun and ran to Yunan's side. His trembling hand reached towards her swollen belly, then he bowed his head.
1:18:36|1:18:41|Buried into her neck. At this moment, Zhang Haitao quickly pulled [Li Jianguo] up.
1:18:43|1:19:1|Soon after, the two looked ahead together, with [Laoying] weakly kneeling beside Yunan, surrounded by special police aiming their guns at him. Then, he slowly stood up, turned his head, and stared gloomily at [Li Jianguo]. Everything seemed to have settled.
1:19:4|1:19:19|Two cars drove out of the factory, with [Li Jianguo] and Zhang Haitao sitting on the back seat of the leading car, one on each side of [Laoying]. Then, the convoy turned into a grove, suddenly, an off-road vehicle caught up from a side road. A drug dealer leaned out and kept firing.
1:19:21|1:19:30|The special police officer in the rear car quickly retaliated, shooting directly into the heart of the drug dealer in the driver's seat. At this moment, a second off-road vehicle appeared.
1:19:31|1:19:41|A drug dealer directly used a rocket launcher to blow up the special police vehicle. [Li Jianguo] looked back in shock, while Zhang Haitao firmly held onto [Laoying]'s body.
1:19:43|1:20:4|Suddenly, a sharp turn, the vehicle lost balance and rolled out. [Laoying] looked in horror at the leaking car, while Zhang Haitao was pinned to the seat, also unconscious. Subsequently, the drug traffickers hurriedly got out of the car, and first lifted [Laoying] out of the already burning vehicle.
1:20:6|1:20:14|Laoying almost frantically had his men pull out Zhang Haitao. And during this process, the car finally couldn't hold up anymore.
1:20:26|1:20:38|The memory ends, [Lin Kai] turns back to look into the cell. Zhang Haitao is leaning against the damp wall, shivering.
1:20:52|1:21:9|Then Lin Kai looked steadily at [Laoying]. At this moment, [Laoying] picked up a handkerchief and vigorously wiped his burnt left ear. In the dimly lit forest, two cars drove forward one after the other.
1:21:12|1:21:17|Sitting in the passenger seat, with his eyes covered, [Lin Kai] curiously asks [Qingshui] who is driving.
1:21:48|1:21:56|Shortly after, [Qingshui] furrowed his brow, recalling the words spoken by a man.
1:22:6|1:22:24|Next, a tear rolled down [Qingshui]'s eyes, but the vehicle still drove into the darkness. The scene shifted to a gloomy afternoon, with [Lin Kai] driving someone to the entrance of a KTV. In the indoor basketball court nearby,
1:22:26|1:22:43|Li Jianguo and several plainclothes police officers were watching through the monitor. Then, he sat down on a chair, put on the listening earphones, and placed them near his ears. At this moment, Lin Kai walked into the KTV with some people. In the spacious place, there was only a cleaning lady tidying up and Wang Bo.
1:22:43|1:22:58|Taking a deep breath, [Lin Kai] relaxedly leaned back on the fabric sofa next to [Wang Bo]. [Wang Bo] lit a cigarette, leaving [Li Jianguo] momentarily stunned.
1:23:15|1:23:27|[Lin Kai] stood up after listening, put his arm around [Wang Bo]'s shoulder, sat beside him, and said seriously.
1:23:33|1:23:37|Li Jianguo, who was listening in, incredulously pressed down on his headphones.
1:23:46|1:23:53|At this moment, the burning vehicle and Zhang Haitao's concern immediately rushed into [Li Jianguo]'s mind.
1:23:55|1:24:17|Everything made his heart ache. Then, he furrowed his brow and slowly took off his headphones. The process seemed to be slowed down, as if one more second would allow him to exert all his strength. After that, he stood up straight, suddenly roared, and fiercely picked up his chair, throwing it forward with all his might.
1:24:18|1:24:24|Attracting the attention of colleagues. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, and the days quickly pass.
1:24:25|1:24:37|In the gloomy weather, [Lin Kai] drove the car and stopped by the side of the road with [Qingshui]. Soon after, a sedan slowly approached. Then, [Wang Bo] opened the back door and came in front of [Lin Kai].
1:24:38|1:24:45|Qingshui, sitting in the passenger seat, listened attentively and then lowered his eyes thoughtfully.
1:25:19|1:25:31|[Li Jianguo] stood in the indoor gym, decisively ended the call with the director. Then he took off his glasses, left without looking back, his steps showing no hesitation at all.
1:25:32|1:25:41|Soon, he followed [Lin Kai] to a hotel room where he was searched by three drug dealers in a row. After confirming his identity, the two of them walked in.
1:25:42|1:25:50|Upon hearing the sound, [Qingshui], who was originally sitting at the table, immediately stood up and kept his eyes on [Li Jianguo]. Then Wang Bo spoke.
1:26:7|1:26:12|[Li Jianguo] stopped him, while [Qingshui] lowered his head and dialed [Laoying]'s phone number.
1:26:16|1:26:26|[Li Jianguo] glanced at [Qingshui], then took a deep breath and took the phone from her hand, putting it to his ear.
1:26:30|1:26:35|[Laoying] stood in the prison cell, with the barely conscious Zhang Haitao behind him. He answered with joy.
1:26:42|1:27:6|He then turned around, pulled the phone away, and when his subordinate understood, he picked up a stick and swung it towards Zhang Haitao. The painful groans passed through the receiver to the other end of the phone. [Li Jianguo] couldn't bear to close his eyes. Afterwards, [Laoying] hung up the phone.
1:27:6|1:27:14|Upon hearing Li Jianguo's request, Laoying suddenly trembled, then remembered his deceased wife and child.
1:27:17|1:27:42|Tears welled up in his eyes as he spoke. [Li Jianguo] was about to hang up the phone when he heard the words, and immediately turned to look at [Lin Kai].
1:27:45|1:28:0|[Qingshui] had just answered the phone when [Li Jianguo] pulled out a handgun from his waist. He then turned around and kicked [Lin Kai] in the chest, quickly fired the gun, causing [Lin Kai] to fall headfirst out of the window from the second floor.
1:28:1|1:28:17|After speaking, [Li Jianguo] stepped over [Qingshui] and walked out of the room first. Wang Bo also tried to follow, but was stopped by a drug dealer pointing a gun at his head. Soon after, the group quickly got into a car and drove away from the hotel.
1:28:17|1:28:30|When passing the intersection, [Qingshui] looked sorrowfully in the direction where [Lin Kai] fell, until he completely disappeared, then he withdrew his gaze. At this moment, plainclothes police officers quickly arrived, and [Lin Kai] lying on top of the van suddenly opened his eyes.
1:28:30|1:28:50|Staring in the direction where [Li Jianguo] left, breathing heavily in frustration. At this moment, sitting in the back seat of the vehicle, [Li Jianguo] has his eyes covered, and the special police are tracking his location through the watch on his wrist. The vehicle then crosses the paddy fields and enters a dense forest.
1:28:52|1:29:10|The car swayed from side to side, with [Qingshui] sitting beside [Li Jianguo], keeping her eyes downcast. A ray of sunlight suddenly poured into the car, she looked out the window, and then, remembered the past. [Laoying] pulled the trigger.
1:29:13|1:29:29|Little [Qingshui] hid under the floor, peeking through the cracks, and saw his father being shot by [Laoying] himself. After [Laoying] left, [Li Jianguo] suddenly looked through the crack and found little [Qingshui] tightly hugging a doll. At that moment, [Laoying] was standing devoutly on the rooftop worshipping.
1:29:41|1:29:56|On the other side, on the quiet mountain road, [Lin Kai] is driving a motorcycle speeding past. Meanwhile, [Li Jianguo] is being grabbed by the drug trafficker on the shoulder, pulled off the car, and then walks towards a small building. [Qingshui] stands by the car, looking at his back with a complex expression in his eyes.
1:29:58|1:30:6|On the rooftop, the birds that were originally circling around the jammer flew away, and then, [Li Jianguo] had the cloth removed from his eyes and walked over.
1:30:7|1:30:41|Laoying, who was originally worshipping, turned around and, upon seeing him, immediately walked up to him, with his eyes glued to him. Li Jianguo also kept staring. At this moment, Laoying stopped not far from Li Jianguo and then, like an old friend, smiled and spoke. Li Jianguo interrupted his reminiscing.
1:30:46|1:30:56|Laoying's upturned mouth froze, he glanced at Li Jianguo, then moved his mouth slightly. Next, he raised his left hand and bent his fingers.
1:30:57|1:31:6|Immediately, a drug dealer pressed down on [Zhang Haitao] and walked towards the two. Then, the drug dealer forcefully kicked his knee and pulled off his hat.
1:31:7|1:31:14|The unrecognizable [Zhang Haitao] looked up and saw [Li Jianguo], instantly covering his face with his hands, but helplessly, his arms were pulled apart by the drug trafficker.
1:31:15|1:31:22|[Li Jianguo] wanted to step forward, but was firmly held back by the drug dealer behind him.
1:31:35|1:31:51|Continuing, he raised his right hand, and the drug dealer behind him immediately handed him a revolver. Then, he unloaded all the bullets from the gun, picked out two, reloaded them into the magazine, and walked slowly to face [Zhang Haitao], squatting down.
1:32:4|1:32:10|[Zhang Haitao] instantly widened his eyes.
1:32:26|1:32:42|Zhang Haitao listened and his eyes became moist. Looking at [Li Jianguo], he trembled helplessly. Then, his right hand was forcibly placed into the pistol by [Laoying]. At this moment, the drug dealer released Zhang Haitao's arms, and he lowered his head to look at the gun in his hand, his right hand trembling uncontrollably.
1:32:43|1:32:55|Laoying was about to burst into laughter, but unexpectedly Zhang Haitao suddenly pressed against his own chin, and Laoying shot Li Jianguo in the left foot.
1:32:57|1:33:12|The drug dealer dragged Zhang Haitao in front of [Li Jianguo], forcing him to point the gun at the other's head, but he refused to shoot. [Laoying] pointed a gun at Zhang Haitao to threaten him.
1:33:14|1:33:32|In desperation, he tightened his index finger, trembling, and pulled the trigger. At the critical moment, [Lin Kai] used a rocket launcher to shoot down the signal jammer one after another. While everyone's attention was diverted, [Li Jianguo] and Zhang Haitao stood up at the same time. [Li Jianguo] first drew the drug dealer's knife and cut the throats of two people.
1:33:33|1:33:50|Zhang Haitao then rolled over and used his gun to take care of the other two. At this moment, the special police joyfully discovered that [Li Jianguo]'s location had reappeared on the map. [Lin Kai] threw away the rocket launcher and moved to the rooftop of another building, aiming his gun at the drug dealers and shooting.
1:33:50|1:33:57|At this moment, [Laoying] took advantage of the chaos and stabbed into the left shoulder of [Li Jianguo], but was then shot in the right knee by him.
1:33:58|1:34:6|The drug dealer lying in ambush on the rooftop immediately opened fire at [Li Jianguo], causing him to crouch down and drag [Zhang Haitao] as they ran downstairs.
1:34:7|1:34:14|Seeing [Laoying] pick up a gun and chase after him, [Lin Kai] immediately aimed and fired wildly, hitting his left shoulder.
1:34:15|1:34:25|So [Laoying] ran to the door and turned around to shoot, seeing [Lin Kai] hiding behind the wall. At the same time, with the drug dealer coming to help, he immediately chose not to fight, turned around, and left the rooftop.
1:34:26|1:34:39|At this moment, [Li Jianguo] and another person arrived at a wall, where they saw [Lin Kai] on the opposite side, exchanging a glance. Then, he pulled out the knife inserted in his left shoulder, lifted [Zhang Haitao] and leaped, stomping on the roof, and dropping into the bungalow.
1:34:43|1:34:48|Two drug dealers were just shot at from above, and they were all sniped by [Lin Kai] on the opposite rooftop.
1:35:2|1:35:6|After running into [Qingshui] head-on, he asks her to take away Yanan's urn.
1:35:7|1:35:13|In the factory, groups of drug dealers take out various weapons from the cabinets.
1:35:14|1:35:31|[Lin Kai] then found a rope on the rooftop, so he tied it to a wooden pole and made a knot. He then grabbed the rope, leaped off, and landed on the street. Meanwhile, [Li Jianguo] took care of a drug dealer with a raised hand.
1:35:32|1:35:50|Handing the pistol to Zhang Haitao behind him, Lin Kai picked up the drug dealer's submachine gun and arrived at an alley. The two of them aimed around, walking back to back, and then stopped in front of a door connected to the street. Looking through the small hole in the door, Li Jianguo saw Laoying leading a large group of drug dealers carrying submachine guns rushing forward.
1:35:50|1:35:54|The residents in the town saw the situation and hurriedly took refuge in their homes.
1:35:55|1:36:3|Shortly after, Zhang Haitao opened the car door and walked out first. Then, [Li Jianguo] led him, walking along the road, and continued forward.
1:37:7|1:37:18|Facing the rain of bullets, [Lin Kai] arrived at the rear of the team. Then, effortlessly took out a few drug dealers, finally, the team's drug dealers were almost cleared.
1:37:20|1:37:35|He took a slight aim, the bullet broke through the air from the muzzle, consecutively piercing through the shoulders of two drug dealers, and then once again straight into [Laoying]'s left shoulder. But [Laoying] seemed to have developed an invincible body, not stopping the shooting action at all.
1:37:36|1:37:48|Suddenly, a car drove up to the intersection ahead, and the drug dealers inside crazily shot at [Lin Kai]. Seeing an opportunity to catch their breath, [Li Jianguo] quickly pushed Zhang Haitao and darted into a small alley on the right.
1:38:3|1:38:17|[Li Jianguo] and [Lin Kai] arrived at a path filled with potted plants. With pursuers behind them, they quickly split up on either side of a low wall. As soon as the drug dealer showed himself, he was shot dead by [Li Jianguo]. Immediately after, Zhang Haitao smoothly took care of the second person who followed closely.
1:38:18|1:38:29|Upon discovering only two drug dealers, [Li Jianguo] quickly picked up the submachine gun on the ground. Suddenly, a gunshot was heard from behind, as [Lin Kai] had shot the attacker. Then he ran over.
1:38:34|1:38:44|Zhang Haitao nodded. Then, the three of them walked towards the intersection together. However, as soon as they showed their heads, they were shot at by the drug dealer on a motorcycle and forced back against the wall.
1:38:45|1:38:53|Seeing another car approaching, [Lin Kai] shot the driver in the heart and then turned around to take out the two people on the motorcycle.
1:38:56|1:39:0|Li Jianguo saw the situation and shouted loudly, causing Zhang Haitao to cover his head and run towards the direction of the car.
1:39:1|1:39:9|After opening the car door, he struggled to pull the drug dealer on the driver's seat to the ground. [Li Jianguo] and [Lin Kai] stood back to back, clearing the drug dealers in front of them.
1:39:10|1:39:29|Suddenly, [Laoying]'s car violently crashed into the rear of Zhang Haitao's car. The two men who were originally in front of the car each jumped into the alleys on both sides, while [Laoying] continued to suppress with firepower. At this moment, the eyes of [Lin Kai] and [Li Jianguo] met, and they quickly rushed towards the intersection. In an instant, their figures overlapped and killed two drug dealers.
1:39:30|1:39:35|Taking advantage of [Laoying] being pinned down by the dead drug dealer, [Li Jianguo] quickly climbed into the driver's seat.
1:39:36|1:39:41|[Lin Kai] saw that the vehicle was not starting, so he placed the gun on the car and pushed the back of the car with force.
1:39:42|1:39:56|At this moment, [Laoying] forcefully lifted the body, picked up the gun, and shot towards [Lin Kai]. Unfortunately, he missed due to his gunshot wound. Then, he turned around, got into the car, stepped on the gas pedal, and accelerated towards the direction of the three people.
1:39:57|1:40:12|The powerful impact provided just the right momentum for [Li Jianguo] to start the vehicle, so he quickly shifted gears and drove forward. Dodging into the roadside, [Lin Kai] saw them accelerating away, crossing over a motorcycle and closely following behind.
1:40:13|1:40:17|Zhang Haitao struggled to hold up his gun, aiming at the approaching drug trafficker in front of the car, ready to take him down at any moment.
1:40:20|1:40:27|[Laoying] stepped on the gas pedal fiercely, trying to overtake, but failed. He could only cover his left shoulder, which was bleeding continuously, in frustration.
1:40:28|1:40:39|At this moment, [Lin Kai] was chasing after them. When he arrived at the intersection and was about to turn, he ran into the drug dealers who came to reinforce. So he changed direction, drove into the nearby corridor, lifted the front of the car, and drove upwards.
1:40:44|1:40:56|Temporarily shaking off a group of gun-wielding thugs, he rode a motorcycle into a kitchen. Turning his head, he saw a gas tank on the ground, kicked the valve with his foot, then lifted the front of the bike to smash the window and flew towards the opposite side.
1:40:58|1:41:11|As if he had eyes on his back, [Lin Kai] suddenly pulled out a gun and shot the gas tank behind him. As a result, the drug dealers who had just entered the kitchen were immediately blown to pieces.
1:41:12|1:41:24|At this moment, he was hit by the explosion and crashed straight into the coffee table in the opposite hotel. After pausing for a moment to hold his stomach, he quickly got up, straddled the motorcycle, smashed through the door panel, and drove towards the corridor.
1:41:25|1:41:34|Lin Kai was about to go downstairs when suddenly a group of drug dealers rushed up. He stepped on the gas pedal, rushed up the stairs, and arrived on the rooftop.
1:41:35|1:41:59|Looking around, before he could decide which way to go, the drug dealer on the opposite rooftop spotted him. So, he had no choice but to grit his teeth and run straight ahead. Seeing this, the drug dealer on the opposite rooftop started shooting at him continuously. Helplessly, the bullets always grazed past him. Finally, the drug dealer got annoyed.
1:41:59|1:42:12|One person mounted the rocket launcher on his shoulder, aimed in the direction of [Lin Kai], and fired. The shell grazed the back of [Lin Kai]'s car, hitting the water tank beside him accurately, and the entire rooftop was quickly engulfed by flames and water.
1:42:13|1:42:20|Taking advantage of the drug dealer's line of sight being blocked by the explosion, [Lin Kai] stepped on the gas again, flew off the rooftop, and landed on the rooftop of another building.
1:42:22|1:42:35|Bowing his head, [Lin Kai] quickly chased after [Li Jianguo] and [Laoying] who were speeding away in their car. At that moment, the two cars collided in the market, with fruits from the stalls scattered all over the ground.
1:44:30|1:44:40|Seeing Laoying's car turning the corner and still closely following Li Jianguo, Lin Kai accelerated towards the car on the side of the road, using the force to leap into the air. Then, with a powerful leap, he grabbed onto the roof of Laoying's car.
1:44:42|1:44:55|Sensing someone above him, [Laoying] abruptly turned the steering wheel, throwing [Lin Kai] straight onto the hood of the car. The drug dealer in the back seat quickly opened fire, but was caught off guard when [Lin Kai] dodged and grabbed onto the car door, raising his hand to hit him in the chest.
1:44:55|1:45:11|Laoying shuddered all over, immediately steering the car towards the truck on the side of the road. Lin Kai, hanging on the side door, had just climbed onto the roof when he was slammed by Laoying's sudden brake into the wall in front of him. Then, Laoying quickly reversed, leaving Lin Kai on the ground, and then stepped on the gas pedal to ram into him.
1:45:12|1:45:29|Fortunately, [Lin Kai] quickly rolled over and managed to hide just under the wall and the front of the car. Unfortunately, he got stuck right at the front wheel. [Laoying] angrily gripped his gun and forcefully opened the driver's door, stepping out.
1:45:30|1:45:39|[Li Jianguo] kept looking at the rearview mirror, checking if there were any vehicles following. At this moment, [Laoying] roared at [Lin Kai].
1:45:41|1:45:52|Upon finishing speaking, he raised the submachine gun in his hand and aimed it at his head. Just as he was about to pull the trigger, he was hit by the high-speed vehicle driven by [Li Jianguo] and sent flying into the air.
1:45:52|1:46:11|Next, [Li Jianguo] kicked open the car door, aimed his gun at [Laoying] who was lying on the ground, then quickly approached [Lin Kai]. Without hesitation, [Li Jianguo] opened the car door. Unexpectedly, as soon as he got into the driver's seat, he was shot in the leg by the drug dealer who drove up behind him.
1:46:12|1:46:17|At this moment, the vehicle moved away, and [Lin Kai] quickly ran to his side.
1:46:20|1:46:31|The drug dealer driving towards them crazily sprayed bullets at the car blocking the road, with [Li Jianguo] hiding behind the car and demanding [Lin Kai] to leave. Therefore, he had to quickly evacuate with [Zhang Haitao].
1:46:32|1:46:39|Driving a distance away, [Lin Kai] saw through the rearview mirror that [Li Jianguo] was firmly guarding the back of the car and shooting forward.
1:46:40|1:46:54|[Zhang Haitao] turned around and watched as his figure gradually disappeared from sight. At that moment, [Li Jianguo] shot the drug dealer in the driver's seat in the head, then crouched down and quietly took out the approaching drug dealer.
1:47:45|1:47:51|At this moment, a drug dealer aimed at [Lin Kai] and fired a stray bullet, which happened to hit the vehicle in front.
1:47:52|1:48:3|But [Lin Kai] showed no fear in the face of the explosion, the blazing car rammed straight into the cars blocking the intersection, and the drug dealers behind dodged and quickly got into the car, accelerating to chase after [Lin Kai].
1:48:6|1:48:13|Back in the town, [Li Jianguo] was lying on the ground, clutching his chest, continuously spitting out blood.
1:48:13|1:48:31|Laoying, lying on the ground, suddenly woke up, struggled to lift his head and looked around, only to find a submachine gun not far from himself. At the same time, he also noticed Li Jianguo, who was eyeing the submachine gun. So the two faced each other and scrambled towards the submachine gun.
1:48:31|1:48:45|Unfortunately, the gun was closest to [Laoying], so when he grabbed it, he shot [Li Jianguo] directly in the left shoulder. Watching the painful [Li Jianguo], the bloodied [Laoying] excitedly asked.
1:49:8|1:49:27|[Laoying] listened, eyes wide open, left hand on the ground, while slowly raising the gun with his right hand. Then, aiming at [Li Jianguo]'s chest, he fired a shot. Seeing [Laoying] pointing the gun at himself again, [Qingshui] pulled the trigger without hesitation, only to have the bullet pass through his own chest.
1:49:27|1:49:50|In an instant, the urn slipped from her hands and she fell backwards on the road. At that moment, a gust of wind blew by, lifting the ashes directly into the air. Seeing this, [Laoying], who was spitting blood, desperately moved his head and hands. With tears in his eyes, he watched as the ashes were blown away bit by bit, continuously sobbing.
1:49:50|1:49:56|Trying every possible means, he climbed towards the direction of the urn, wanting to touch it again with his own hands, leaving a mark for himself from Yunan.
1:49:58|1:50:19|Suddenly, [Li Jianguo] opened his eyes again and looked at [Laoying], who had crawled to his feet. He took out a dagger from behind, knelt down, and plunged it straight into [Laoying]'s back. As [Qingshui] watched this [Li Jianguo], she was reminded of the scene from her childhood when she hid under a wooden board and saw her father being shot.
1:50:19|1:50:27|Li Jianguo gently patted her.
1:50:36|1:50:51|After speaking, [Li Jianguo] moved his hand away from her mouth, then tapped her nose, smiled, and then, bent over, left from under the wooden board. Now, seeing the man who once couldn't bear to harm himself, covered in blood.
1:50:52|1:50:57|[Qingshui] slowly closed his eyes, tears streaming down from the corners of his eyes.
1:51:12|1:51:34|As the sun sets in the west, three people lie on the ground for a long time. On the other side, [Lin Kai] drives through a field of waist-high rice paddies in a hurry. Even though the dust kicked up blocks the view of the drug dealers behind him, the bullets they crazily shoot make him remain vigilant. At this moment, the vehicle drives through the rice paddies and arrives in the woods.
1:51:34|1:51:41|After twisting and turning, he drilled deeper. But [Lin Kai] suddenly noticed that Zhang Haitao was no longer making any noise.
1:51:51|1:52:14|After speaking, [Lin Kai] stepped on the gas pedal hard, passing through another bend, while the drug trafficker behind him mounted a machine gun and chased relentlessly. At this moment, [Lin Kai] stretched his neck, looked up at the sky, observed the direction of the swaying leaves, and then took out a signal flare from his pocket. Subsequently, a signal flare with a special mark bloomed above the river.
1:52:20|1:52:38|In the helicopter, the pilot quickly reported the direction upon seeing the signal flare. The special police officers rushing to the river drove the airboat towards the target. At this moment, [Lin Kai] emerged from the woods, stomped on the gas pedal under the crazy gunfire of the drug traffickers, and headed straight towards the river.
1:52:38|1:52:48|Before falling into the water, [Lin Kai] threw himself towards [Zhang Haitao], using his body to block most of the impact from the rushing water, and then pushed him out of the car with all his strength.
1:52:49|1:53:7|At this moment, [Zhang Haitao] used both hands and feet to emerge from the water, breathing in fresh air deeply. Seeing that [Lin Kai] had not surfaced for a long time, it turned out that his shoelace was tangled on the clutch. So, he gritted his teeth and bent down to search. Finally, just before running out of breath, he successfully emerged from the water.
1:53:7|1:53:18|The two figures were quickly spotted by the armed police on the flying boat. Before the drug traffickers could shoot at them, they continued to suppress the firepower on the shore.
1:53:19|1:53:34|Seeing the reinforcements arrive, the drug dealers quickly retreated and rushed into their cars, preparing to escape. However, the special police had already locked down all of Laoying's strongholds in the small town. The drug manufacturing plant and transportation lines were all wiped out by a large number of armed forces.
1:53:34|1:53:44|Next, [Lin Kai] and Zhang Haitao were pulled onto the airship, escorted by multiple helicopters, turned a corner, facing the setting sun, and headed towards China.
1:54:14|1:54:22|[Lin Kai] in police uniform, arrived at the cemetery.
1:54:33|1:54:41|As soon as the director finished speaking, nearly 50 police officers holding police caps solemnly saluted.
1:54:43|1:54:49|Standing on both sides of the bureau chief, [Lin Kai] and Zhang Haitao, looking at the tombstone of [Li Jianguo], unwilling to put down the right hand saluting for a long time.
1:55:11|1:55:24|At this moment, [Lin Kai] recalled the instructions from the director in the office, and finally couldn't help but shed tears. Zhang Haitao sat in a wheelchair, looking at his 36-year-old comrade.
