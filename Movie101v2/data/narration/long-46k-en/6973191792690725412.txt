0:1:23|0:1:43|Three days later, [Debt-ridden Boss] and two bodyguards continued to climb the world's fifth highest peak, Mount Makalu. The three of them, dressed in thick climbing gear, were climbing in a staggered formation. The chubby bodyguard at the back heard a strange sound, looked back in confusion, and, after confirming that there was no one behind him, hurried to catch up with the team. As the three of them moved forward in a huddle, a sudden noise came from behind.
0:1:44|0:2:1|Three people heard strange noises and simultaneously stopped in their tracks, slowly turning to look at the cliff behind them. Suddenly, a hand holding a baseball bat emerged at the edge of the bottomless cliff, with the bat firmly planted in the snow. The three, taken aback by the unknown situation, were startled. When they regained their composure, they saw two legs without pants struggling to climb up from the cliff edge.
0:2:1|0:2:19|The three of them looked at each other in confusion. While they were still standing there dumbfounded, [Mo Feli] finally climbed up from the cliff edge. [Mo Feli] had an explosion hairstyle, wearing only a thin vest and shorts in the extremely cold snowy mountains. His eyebrows, beard, and the little clothes he had were all frosted, with long icicles hanging from his nostrils made of frozen snot.
0:2:20|0:2:38|With rolled eyes and a twisted body, trembling, [Mo Feli] walked towards the three people. When he reached [Lao Ding], he rudely opened Lao Ding's mink coat and slipped inside, taking a deep breath before regaining his composure. Unable to speak, [Mo Feli] used his thumb and index finger to gesture for money. Perplexed, [Lao Ding] asked:
0:2:44|0:2:49|[Mo Feli] gestured with his hands as if complaining, while also providing his own voiceover.
0:2:58|0:3:4|Before [Mo Feli] could finish laughing, the bodyguard knocked him unconscious with a punch.
0:3:16|0:3:37|The bodyguards then took turns stepping on it, and the three stopped and slowly turned to look at [Mo Feli], only to see [Mo Feli] slowly getting up with blood all over his face. At this time, the famous prelude of the Dolphin Opera II slowly sounded, and the three looked puzzled at [Mo Feli], who was swaying his neck and preparing to sing.
0:4:5|0:4:13|[Mo Feli]'s high-pitched voice reverberated in the rugged mountain peaks, the outrageous high notes causing the glacier beneath his feet to crack open, with the crevice shooting straight towards the summit.
0:4:16|0:4:36|Another high-pitched sound shook the earth, and the snow on the mountain peak cascaded down for hundreds of meters. The massive avalanche rushed towards the four people like a flood. While Lao Ding and the others panicked and fled, Mo Feli remained calm, singing. However, at this moment, all rescue measures were in vain as they were all engulfed by the avalanche.
0:4:36|0:4:51|After the avalanche, the majestic snow-capped mountains resembled a silver dragon lying on the clouds. At this moment, [Mo Feli] walked unscathed towards the cliff edge, watching as three people clung tightly to a rope suspended in mid-air. [Mo Feli] menacingly said:
0:5:0|0:5:12|[Mo Feli] watched as his boss, who called him a thug, provocatively blew him a kiss. In the blue sky behind him, the white clouds formed four big characters: Evil Angel. And thus, the title of the film appeared.
0:5:13|0:5:39|After the clouds were scattered by the strong wind, they also came from the snowy mountains to the sunny city. In a parking lot, a girl with short hair, wearing large-framed glasses, and showing two big front teeth like a rabbit, [Zha Xiaodao], was holding a stack of thick certificates. Every step she took was on the white lines of the parking spaces. Under her round appearance, she walked straight, looking very silly and cute. When there was a car blocking her way, she still followed the neat white lines to go around it.
0:5:39|0:5:57|When she encountered the white line on the manhole cover that was not connected to the one under her feet, she hesitated for a moment. After jumping over the manhole cover, she looked pleased, as if she had solved a major problem by herself. She continued to walk happily along the white line, but after only a few steps, she was blocked by a couple kissing against the red and green traffic light pole.
0:6:1|0:6:29|Watching the two people lost in their own world and the red light displayed, [Zha Xiaodao] helplessly stopped in his tracks. At this moment, a couple followed a group of pedestrians and ran the red light, crossing the road. Shortly after, when [Zha Xiaodao] saw the green light, he continued happily walking forward. Suddenly, a worn-out off-road vehicle rushed out and knocked [Zha Xiaodao] to the ground. The door opened, and a similarly tattered boot stepped heavily on the waterlogged road surface. At that moment, the sky changed abruptly, and dark clouds gathered in an instant.
0:6:29|0:6:39|Wearing sunglasses, the rough and unkempt thug [Mo Feli] strode menacingly towards [Zha Xiaodao], who was lying on the ground. As [Zha Xiaodao] struggled to sit up, holding onto the scattered certificates, he said to [Mo Feli]:
0:7:22|0:7:28|The camera captures a deep indentation on the side of [Zha Xiaodao]'s face in the car.
0:8:12|0:8:24|After Zha Xiaodao passed out from blood loss, Mo Feli also fainted due to blood loss and collapsed. Zha Xiaodao was taken to the hospital with a net-like bandage wrapped around his head and tissues stuffed tightly in his nostrils.
0:8:24|0:8:40|Sitting alone under the bridge with a thick certificate in hand, [Mo Feli] absentmindedly washed her glasses by the pool, wiped them casually with her hand, and then put them on in a daze. Occasionally, her head would ache faintly, and she would wipe the water droplets off the lenses with her hand, frowning and sitting listlessly on the steps.
0:8:40|0:8:48|At this moment, a dog walked up to her. Upon seeing the dog, [Zha Xiaodao] swept away the previous gloom and smiled with her long front teeth, saying to the dog:
0:9:7|0:9:28|As soon as the words fell, the dog squatted on the certificate and pooped. [Zha Xiaodao] quickly took out a tissue from his bag, picked it up stealthily, looked at the direction the dog ran in with a grievance, then lowered his head to look at the poop in his hand. Helplessly, he wrapped up the poop and put it in his pocket, then wiped the marks on the certificate.
0:9:28|0:9:36|At this moment, the dog came back with a flyer in its mouth. [Zha Xiaodao] looked at the flyer and slowly raised his head to look at the sky, as if he saw his own hope.
0:9:36|0:9:45|Following the address on the flyer, [Zha Xiaodao] arrived at an old residential area that looked like a construction site. She entered with a puzzled look, observing the dense scaffolding. Suddenly, a voice came from beside her,
0:9:57|0:10:5|The parrot then pressed the switch, and at that moment, the psychologist on stage was giving a speech to the audience in the room.
0:10:36|0:10:42|After the speech, Zha Xiaodao went to Zhe Ergen's office.
0:10:53|0:11:5|After [Zhe Ergen] finished speaking, he sniffed the mark left by the puppy's poop. Ignoring advice, he stuck out his tongue and licked the mark, then sighed:
0:12:8|0:12:14|Chairman [Hua Zong] laughed heartily, gave a thumbs up, and then exchanged a glance with Manager [Ji]. Subsequently, Manager [Ji] fired her.
0:13:7|0:13:18|[Mo Feli] rushed towards the spinning air conditioner unit with an iron rod in hand, but accidentally stepped into a hole and fell to the ground. He then used the rod to knock down the air conditioner unit. [Zhe Ergen] continued to describe the scene.
0:13:55|0:14:1|The child was scared by [Mo Feli] and ran back home crying.
0:14:18|0:14:29|Realizing the situation, [Zhe Ergen] leaped out of the second-floor window, while [Zha Xiaodao] was still worried. Outside the door, [Mo Feli] shouted:
0:14:33|0:14:50|Upon seeing Mo Feli enter, the parrot said: After listening to Mo Feli, he slowly turned around and looked at the many fluttering banners, then slowly approached, quickly lifting the banner with an iron rod.
0:14:56|0:15:4|After listening, [Zha Xiaodao] tightly closed his eyes and shivered, trying to please, saying: Then the two of them looked at each other for a moment,
0:15:10|0:15:22|After finishing speaking, [Mo Feli] covered with the banner on his head, fled in the office, and was soon pinned against the wall by [Mo Feli].
0:15:34|0:15:46|[Mo Feli] actually used his mouth to open the bottle cap shouted by [Zha Xiaodao]. Then, after [Zhe Ergen] finished stitching up [Mo Feli], he said to [Zha Xiaodao],
0:16:6|0:16:18|Twisting the needles on Mo Feli's head, hundreds of fine needles pierced [Mo Feli]'s body and head, like a hedgehog. [Zhe Ergen] turned the fine needles and whispered:
0:16:40|0:16:47|Zha Xiaodao, who was listening on the side, said angrily:
0:17:14|0:17:26|Hypnotized Zha Xiaodao happily walked along the straight road, Zhe Ergen looked at Zha Xiaodao's back with a cunning smile. The next day, Mo Feli was making a phone call outside the venue.
0:18:7|0:18:26|[Zha Xiaodao] hesitated as she tightly held onto her long coat. Reluctantly, she took off the coat to reveal a shirt with the same flamboyant pattern as [Mo Feli]'s. [Mo Feli] smirked satisfactorily as he took off [Zha Xiaodao]'s glasses, then handed her a pair of sunglasses.
0:18:42|0:19:9|[Zha Xiaodao] gritted his teeth, then made a motion of opening his mouth, after a moment of contemplation, he forcefully opened his mouth and stuck out his tongue. Then all his facial features squeezed together. [Mo Feli] took out a roll of tissue and asked in resignation. Holding a torch ice cream, [Mo Feli] shouted loudly across the street to [Zha Xiaodao]:
0:19:43|0:20:5|Desperate [Zha Xiaodao] rushed into the fast-moving traffic, stopping at the first dashed line to look around, then darting to the second dashed line. Startled by the vehicles speeding past, [Zha Xiaodao] spun in place several times. While [Mo Feli] was still in shock, [Zha Xiaodao] had already made it to the middle of the road. After looking left and right, [Zha Xiaodao] gathered courage, let out a loud roar, and charged towards [Mo Feli] with lightning speed.
0:20:17|0:20:46|Zha Xiaodao looked blankly at the overpass next to him, and said, "[Mo Feli]" with a torch in his hand, then turned away with a look of disdain. After building up their courage, the two of them arrived at the debt-ridden game hall. They wore sunglasses and flamboyant uniforms, striding aggressively down the corridor of the game hall. Xiaodao, who had just been trained, swaggered with Mo Feli's baseball bat, showing great momentum.
0:20:46|0:20:54|The fierce-looking duo scared away the customers around them, causing Zha Xiaodao to excitedly say to [Mo Feli].
0:21:2|0:21:18|Zha Xiaodao then swayed from side to side, holding a baseball bat in her hand, tossing it back and forth. As soon as she finished speaking, more than ten fierce-looking men with sticks in hand came from all directions in the room, standing behind Zha Xiaodao and imitating her movements.
0:21:21|0:21:27|Mo Feli turned around helplessly, noticing Zha Xiaodao slowly turning his head,
0:21:29|0:21:46|Unable to stand the noise, [Mo Feli] shouted at the woman on the drum next to him: After the noise stopped, [Mo Feli] took out a crumpled piece of paper and asked:
0:21:59|0:22:7|[Mo Feli] pretended to look at the words on the paper again.
0:23:2|0:23:12|Finishing speaking, he took off his sunglasses and stared at everyone. It was then revealed that [Mo Feli]'s left eyeball was made of machinery, constantly rotating in the eye socket and emitting a red light. The thugs looked at him in astonishment.
0:23:31|0:23:44|Rui Simo, who had just picked his nose, was about to charge at [Mo Feli], but he pulled out a bottle of wine and smashed it on his own head, the astonishing momentum frightening Rui Simo and the others away.
0:24:57|0:25:5|After listening, [Mo Feli] angrily threw down the bag, picked up a stick, and walked towards Rui Simo.
0:25:10|0:25:23|At the command of [Rui Simo], the thugs rushed forward without hesitation. Faced with the aggressive attackers, [Mo Feli] remained unusually calm, knocking down each oncoming thug with a single slap.
0:25:32|0:25:40|[Mo Feli] covered his hand and kicked the cash-filled box towards [Zha Xiaodao] in frustration, then proceeded to knock down several people in a row. Beside him, Xiaodao gazed dreamily and said:
0:25:50|0:26:16|After Zha Xiaodao pushed the box away, the thugs wielded their clubs and attacked Mo Feli. However, they couldn't harm Mo Feli at all due to his agile skills. Mo Feli took on ten opponents and gained the upper hand, leaping and dodging in the crowd, striking with force. In the end, one man cowered in fear, with four bloody marks on his left cheek from Mo Feli's blows. After knocking him down, Mo Feli turned to face the others, just as they were about to rush towards him.
0:26:17|0:26:38|Everyone stood still after hearing the news. At this moment, [Zha Xiaodao], who had taken the wrong path, walked through the crowd. While everyone was still in shock, [Mo Feli] took the initiative to attack, slapping each of the thugs in the face who happened to be standing in a row. With a final punch, he sent the thug at the end flying. On the other side, [Zha Xiaodao], holding a box, was still walking in a straight line inside the arcade.
0:26:39|0:26:50|After a moment, many thugs were knocked down to the ground, leaving only the fat man with a face full of bloodstains, trembling with a big drum in his hands. Finally, he shouted and smashed the drum on himself, fainting on the ground. Seeing this, [Mo Feli] raised his hand and turned to walk towards [Rui Simo].
0:26:57|0:27:9|With a masculine appearance, [Rui Simo] bit her hair coquettishly and said, "After Chen's debt was recovered, [Rui Simo]'s two subordinates, due to their incompetence, sat on the oven and cried out in pain."
0:27:10|0:27:18|[Hua Zong] sighed and said:
0:28:9|0:28:30|After collecting debts at the game hall, [Mo Feli] drove his rusty jeep back home. His residence was located in an old factory yard, where numerous pipes intertwined in the vast factory. The yard was overgrown with weeds and rarely visited. [Mo Feli] casually parked the car, got out, and knocked his head with a slightly pained expression.
0:28:30|0:28:53|At this moment, a little white dog ran towards him. [Mo Feli] set down the box containing cash and the baseball bat, sat on the roadside, took out prepared dog food to feed the dog. A rare smile appeared on his face. Just then, there was a noise from the nearby pipe. Cautiously, [Mo Feli] approached slowly, his footsteps lightly treading on the grass, making no sound. He arrived at the pipe, without even looking, kicked towards the inside.
0:29:0|0:29:10|At this moment, the disheveled [Zha Xiaodao] slowly crawled out, pointing at the shoe print on his face and said:
0:29:33|0:29:38|After speaking, [Mo Feli] followed to the filthy and messy basement.
0:30:16|0:30:35|[Zha Xiaodao] curiously followed [Mo Feli]'s instructions and walked forward, but bumped his head on a pipe after just a few steps. They then walked through the passage, with Zha Xiaodao in front and Mo Feli behind. At first, the entrance of the passage was small, but after walking for dozens of steps, it suddenly opened up, revealing a vast expanse of land with buildings scattered around.
0:30:35|0:30:48|[Zha Xiaodao] came out of the passage, unconsciously opening his mouth in surprise as he looked around. He saw pedestrians coming and going, chatting and laughing, leisurely and carefree. He never expected such a lively place beneath the appearance of the abandoned factory, like a paradise on earth.
0:30:48|0:31:3|[Zha Xiaodao] curiously asked [Mo Feli], but [Mo Feli] glanced at her without replying, and continued walking forward. At that moment, a woman with heavy makeup and exaggerated attire bumped into [Mo Feli].
0:31:32|0:31:38|Guo Sisi, feeling bored, noticed Zha Xiaodao standing aside and sarcastically remarked:
0:31:58|0:32:30|Standing in a row again, the neighbors watching the excitement said, "As soon as the words fell, the courtyard was empty of people. At this moment, [Mo Feli] also closed the door heavily and entered the room. [Zha Xiaodao] curiously looked at everything in the room, which was not small and filled with all kinds of strange things. [Zha Xiaodao] seemed to completely ignore [Mo Feli]'s warning just now and continued to explore his treasures with great curiosity."
0:32:48|0:32:53|Mo Feli walked up to a bell, about to reach out, when [Mo Feli] said to her with his back turned:
0:33:3|0:33:12|The whole room then shook as if in an earthquake.
0:33:37|0:33:44|At this moment, [Mo Feli] is sitting on the bed, wearing an eye mask and earplugs. After taking a sleeping pill and drinking a sip of beer, he is ready to go to sleep.
0:34:30|0:34:39|In the blink of an eye, [Mo Feli] lay down on the ground and fell asleep, while glaring with wide eyes, sat on the ground, watching [Zha Xiaodao] snoring.
0:34:53|0:34:57|Zha Xiaodao's snoring shook the water on the ground through the pipes,
0:34:59|0:35:15|Desperate [Mo Feli] brought out her trump card, the noisy little pig squealed loudly in her ear, the distraught [Mo Feli] frantically beat her own head, hearing the sound of a stick, Xiaodao muttered in her sleep.
0:35:22|0:35:48|[Mo Feli] slowly put down the stick, looking thoughtfully at Xiaodao. At this moment, another snore broke the brief silence, completely frustrating [Mo Feli], who banged his head against the wall. Meanwhile, in the next room, [Guo Sisi] heard the commotion and with a tearful voice said, "Seeing no more movement, [Guo Sisi] thought it was over."
0:35:48|0:35:56|The next day, [Manager Ji] brought his men to the slaughterhouse.
0:36:16|0:36:22|Later, known as "Pull Pants Pocket", was sharpening a knife under the pocket, raised his head and said:
0:36:45|0:36:50|After speaking, he raised the photo of [Mo Feli], looked at it in his pocket, and remembered what happened at Mount Makalu.
0:36:52|0:37:0|Quickly and neatly knocked the knife out of [Manager Ji]'s hand, and threw his own butcher knife, along with a photo, into the hanging pork. On the other side,
0:37:0|0:37:11|Yesterday, the basement was called Sisi Inn. [Guo Sisi] not only is the landlord here, but also runs a barber shop in the inn. The inn seems small, but many people live here. Their daily life is plain yet exciting.
0:37:32|0:37:44|After scanning the courtyard, they arrived at Mo Feli's home. The little white dog walked up to Zha Xiaodao, who was still sound asleep on the floor, and licked her face. The sunlight shone through the only window in the house onto Zha Xiaodao's face. She groggily opened her eyes and saw the vacant gaze of the dog.
0:37:48|0:37:54|[Zha Xiaodao] looked at the listless [Mo Feli] with a hint of guilt, lowered his head, and discovered that his pants were wet and emitting a strange smell, so he sniffed them.
0:37:58|0:38:17|[Mo Feli] remained motionless in the same position as before. Seeing this, [Zha Xiaodao] stood up and continued to ask. After a while, [Mo Feli]'s eyelids moved slightly, like a robot, inching his body forward step by step, walking to the shelf and throwing a pair of denim shorts at her.
0:38:19|0:38:38|[Zha Xiaodao] ran to change clothes and accidentally stepped on a squeaky toy pig. Startled, [Mo Feli] paused for a moment before picking up tissue paper and heading towards the restroom. At that moment, [Guo Sisi], with her makeup smudged from crying, stood at the door and asked:
0:38:48|0:39:17|Guo Sisi leaned against the wall, without turning her head, pretending to be calm. When she heard Mo Feli walking away, she let go of her facade and burst into tears. Guo Sisi saw Zha Xiaodao wearing Mo Feli's pants, unable to accept it, she screamed loudly, hugged her head, and ran out. Zha Xiaodao watched her run out in surprise, looking at the decibel meter that was blown off the charts by the screams.
0:39:27|0:39:29|After quickly going through the account book, she thought for a moment with a contemplative expression.
0:39:33|0:39:39|Later, [Mo Feli] drove with [Zha Xiaodao], who had not slept all night and was yawning constantly in the car. Seeing this, [Zha Xiaodao] reminded him:
0:40:11|0:40:18|Shortly after, [Mo Feli] pressed the button in the car, and the passenger seat slid out of the car.
0:40:50|0:41:3|[Zha Xiaodao], who was hit out of the car, crashed into the hanging fish.
0:41:16|0:41:23|Then the two of you arrived at Zhe Ergen's clinic, where Zhe Ergen boasted:
0:41:32|0:41:41|After [Zha Xiaodao] finished speaking, with his wind-blown messy hair, he took out [Mo Feli]'s account book from his bag and placed it on the table. Upon seeing the account book, [Zhe Ergen]'s face changed drastically.
0:42:16|0:42:23|Mo Feli stormed out angrily.
0:42:34|0:42:41|After the two left, [Manager Ji] and [Debt-ridden Boss] emerged from the roadside barrier.
0:43:0|0:43:5|In the wax museum, [Lao Ding] waited for [Mo Feli] while bowing his head and talking to the two turtles he brought.
0:43:29|0:43:38|Standing in front of [Lao Ding], unexpectedly, was [Zhe Ergen]. After listening, [Zhe Ergen] revealed an evil smile. Soon, [Mo Feli] arrived at the wax museum with [Zha Xiaodao].
0:43:50|0:43:56|She ran to the wax figure of [Empress Zhen Huan], lost in a trance as she stared at it. [Zha Xiaodao] bore a striking resemblance to the wax figure.
0:43:59|0:44:21|Here's an explanation for everyone. The actress who plays [Zha Xiaodao], Sun Li, once played [Empress Zhen Huan]. The wax figure in the wax museum is also made based on Sun Li's face. After looking at the wax figure, the two continue walking forward. At this moment, [Mo Feli] suddenly stops, puts down the backpack, hands the baseball bat to [Zha Xiaodao], and instructs:
0:44:41|0:45:1|Upon waking up, [Mo Feli] cautiously walked up to the second floor. The wax museum was an unfinished building with no guardrails or tiles. [Mo Feli] carefully examined the area where the wax figures were placed on the second floor. Each wax figure was incredibly lifelike. He passed by the wax figures as if on high alert, suddenly striking a combat pose. The wax figures around him did not move. After taking a few steps, he quickly turned around.
0:45:6|0:45:31|Highly nervous, [Mo Feli] kept looking around, inspecting one by one. After circling around, he came to a wax figure holding a cigar. Just as [Mo Feli] lowered his head to light the cigar, a flying knife flashed past from behind. The head of the wax figure fell to the ground like a ball. Immediately, [Zha Xiaodao] rushed over. [Mo Feli] agilely dodged, and [Zha Xiaodao] smashed the head of the wax figure with a punch. [Mo Feli] jumped onto [Zha Xiaodao]'s shoulders to prepare for a counterattack, but due to his heavy build, [Mo Feli] was knocked back against a wooden crate.
0:45:31|0:45:56|Above, [La Kuadou] dragged his leg back and forth on the box, finally lifting [Mo Feli] and throwing him heavily to the side. Downstairs, [Zha Xiaodao] was holding a baseball bat and practicing behind the wall. Upstairs, [La Kuadou] had already cornered [Mo Feli], leaving him nowhere to escape. However, he bumped into a wax figure, causing the spear in the wax figure's hand to fall beside [Mo Feli]. After picking up the spear, [Mo Feli] laughed and pointed it at [La Kuadou]. Seeing this, [La Kuadou] dared not make any rash moves. Subsequently, [Mo Feli] spun the spear twice and began to stab towards [La Kuadou].
0:45:56|0:46:12|Unexpectedly, the obese [Mo Feli] displayed agile movements, constantly twisting his body to evade the incoming spears. [Mo Feli] changed tactics and began wildly thrusting towards [Zha Xiaodao]. [Zha Xiaodao] continuously blocked the spears with his knife, and finally with a strong blow, he chopped off the spear of the wax figure. After a moment of awkward silence, [Zha Xiaodao] laughed and leaped towards [Mo Feli].
0:46:12|0:46:32|[Mo Feli] instinctively blocked with his spear, which was instantly split in half. Then [Zha Xiaodao] wildly attacked [Mo Feli] with his knife. [Mo Feli] had no choice but to continue blocking with the now broken spear. After a moment, the spear had turned into a candle. Just as [Zha Xiaodao] was about to strike with his knife, [Mo Feli] suddenly lit the candle in his hand.
0:46:46|0:47:2|While clutching his face in pain from being hit in the crotch, [Mo Feli] ran away, while downstairs [Zha Xiaodao] nervously practiced with a baseball bat, mimicking the pose of the nearby Bruce Lee wax figure. As [Mo Feli] turned a corner and disappeared, the angry [Zha Xiaodao] looked around at the wax figures in the vicinity.
0:47:2|0:47:18|Mo Feli, now in a different outfit, stood still among the wax figures, one hand covering his mouth and the other pointing to the left. As Zha Xiaodao slowly passed by, not noticing him, Mo Feli took a breath and tried to leave quietly. Suddenly, Zha Xiaodao turned around, causing Mo Feli to quickly change his pose and continue pretending to be a wax figure.
0:47:18|0:47:49|Pulling his pants pocket, it seemed like he thought that the person might be hiding in the wax figure. He then turned around and forcefully broke off the arm of a wax figure next to him. Upon seeing this, [Mo Feli] covered his mouth in panic and retracted his arm. Pulling his pants pocket looked at the puzzled [Mo Feli] who had changed his posture. Approaching and inspecting him, he tapped his belly with his hand. Hearing the hollow sound, he then leaned in to smell [Mo Feli]'s belly. [Mo Feli] looked down at Pulling his pants pocket with disdain. At that moment, he suddenly looked up, and [Mo Feli] quickly followed suit to adjust his posture. Pulling his pants pocket, who hadn't found any clues, went to pull [Mo Feli]'s arm that he was covering his mouth with.
0:47:49|0:48:6|[Mo Feli] exerted his strength, causing his upper body to bend down. Suddenly releasing his grip, [Mo Feli] bounced back to his original position like a rubber man, even shaking realistically. Then, he grabbed [Mo Feli]'s arm with more force, pulling it down. Releasing again, the arm bounced back to its original position once more.
0:48:6|0:48:32|Later, Pull Pants Pocket punched hard on his chest, seeing [Mo Feli] unmoved, Pull Pants Pocket then punched his stomach with force, followed by another punch towards his crotch, [Mo Feli] grimaced but held on. At this moment, Pull Pants Pocket pulled out a short sword, before [Mo Feli] could react, he stabbed towards his foot. [Mo Feli] gritted his teeth, writhing in pain, and couldn't help but let out a loud scream.
0:48:39|0:49:0|After attacking and robbing, [Mo Feli] ran out, chasing [Zha Xiaodao] desperately in the empty unfinished building. When they reached the stairs on the first floor, [Mo Feli] shouted: [Mo Feli] leaped out and landed on the ground, while [Zha Xiaodao] following closely behind was knocked unconscious by a stick. [Mo Feli] looked at the unconscious [Zha Xiaodao] with cold sweat, closed his eyes with his hand, and slowly reached out to [Zha Xiaodao].
0:49:3|0:49:14|Shortly after, [Mo Feli] and [Zha Xiaodao] hurriedly fled with a box full of cash. As they passed by a group of wax figures, the box accidentally slipped. When they turned back to pick it up, they suddenly felt a chill down their spines. Surrounded by the wax figures, they dared not make any sudden movements. At that moment, a wax figure behind them started to approach.
0:49:14|0:49:34|The two suddenly turned around, the wax figure still standing in place. At this moment, several wax figures behind them also approached. After exchanging a glance, [Mo Feli] grabbed Zha Xiaodao's arm and prepared to rush out. However, the wax figures surrounded them and burst into laughter.
0:49:34|0:49:48|The wax figure was originally played by [Manager Ji] and his subordinates. Meanwhile, [Guo Sisi] was watching TV at home. In the TV show, Shui Sheng was hit by a bullet while trying to protect his loved one. [Guo Sisi] was deeply immersed in it, crying uncontrollably.
0:49:50|0:50:10|The camera slowly turns to Shuisheng on the TV, whose face bears a striking resemblance to [Mo Feli]. Guo Sisi, upon seeing this, spits out the milk tea she was drinking. Shuisheng strikes a handsome pose at the camera, causing Guo Sisi to cry even harder at the sight of the Mo Feli look-alike. Just then, the commotion outside the door snaps the mesmerized Guo Sisi back to reality, where someone is picking the lock at the door of [Mo Feli].
0:50:26|0:50:31|With that, taking off the mask revealed [Zhe Ergen], the bruised and swollen [Zhe Ergen] continued speaking:
0:50:44|0:50:53|Upon hearing these words, [Guo Sisi] was overjoyed as if she had entered heaven, laughing and dancing with joy, and immediately underwent a 180-degree change in attitude towards [Zhe Ergen].
0:51:47|0:52:12|Meanwhile, in the wax museum, [Zha Xiaodao] and [Mo Feli] were surrounded at the edge of the third floor without a railing. On the side, [Manager Ji] made a video call to [Hua Zong], tearing off the fake beard on his face and then turning the tablet towards [Zha Xiaodao].
0:53:6|0:53:10|At this moment, Zha Xiaodao glared angrily at Mo Feli with furrowed brows and a fierce look.
0:53:25|0:53:53|After stopping the person about to attack, he took out a beer bottle from his bag and smashed it on his own head. Surprisingly, the bottle did not break. [Mo Feli] awkwardly smiled and then fiercely smashed it on his head again. Despite the forceful blow, the bottle remained intact in [Mo Feli]'s hand. It turned out that the prop bottle that was smashed by [Zha Xiaodao] earlier was replaced with a real one in the bag. Unaware, [Mo Feli] shouted loudly.
0:53:55|0:54:3|After being hit three times, [Mo Feli] saw stars and staggered.
0:54:12|0:54:21|[Zha Xiaodao] struck [Mo Feli] with a blow, causing him to crouch on the ground, holding his head and continuously vomiting.
0:54:31|0:54:48|Mo Feli, who gradually realized what was happening, asked, "Manager Ji placed the tablet in his hands in front of his chest, then handed it to the two people beside him."
0:55:42|0:55:50|Mo Feli, who was emotionally excited, finished speaking and also jumped down. While the other three were still in a daze, Mo Feli bounced back up.
0:55:54|0:56:7|On the first floor, there was a huge trampoline. [Mo Feli] was playing around with everyone, jumping up and down. At that moment, [Zha Xiaodao] arrived by car.
0:56:13|0:56:19|Upon hearing this, [Mo Feli] widened his eyes in astonishment and quickly drove away, with everyone chasing closely behind.
0:56:32|0:56:42|The two rushed out of the factory, speeding all the way. Outside the factory on the road, Manager Ji and his men also drove closely behind, with four cars side by side, sticking tightly to Mo Feli's car.
0:56:43|0:57:13|Mo Feli calmly drifted into the curve, reached out to pull down the mechanism above his head, and then the trunk opened. A large bag of rainbow candies poured out like a flood, covering the road. The rainbow candies caused the two cars behind to slide to the side. Before Mo Feli could be happy for long, Zha Xiaodao stumbled and chased after him from a small road. Zha Xiaodao drove alongside Mo Feli's car, gesturing provocatively with his men. Mo Feli watched as Zha Xiaodao took his hands off the steering wheel. Seeing this, Mo Feli also let go of the steering wheel. With a loud shout, Mo Feli forcefully pulled the steering wheel out.
0:57:13|0:57:35|Zha Xiaodao on the side looked at the two in horror. At this moment, Mo Feli also pulled out the steering wheel without backing down, looking smugly at Mo Feli. Mo Feli widened his eyes in surprise. Driven by his competitive spirit, Mo Feli shouted and threw the steering wheel out, then turned to yell at Mo Feli. Not willing to admit defeat, Mo Feli also threw the steering wheel out after gritting her teeth. Before she could feel triumphant, Mo Feli, who was prepared, took out a steering wheel the same size as a faucet from his pocket.
0:57:35|0:57:40|With a smug smile on his face, [Mo Feli] waved at [Menglu], then quickly moved forward, skillfully dodging the obstacles in front of him.
0:57:41|0:57:48|Without a steering wheel, [Mo Feli] could only watch helplessly as the car crashed into the obstacle, flipping in the air twice before landing heavily on the ground.
0:57:49|0:58:16|Regaining consciousness, [Zha Xiaodao] saw [Mo Feli]'s mechanical eye hanging on his eyelid. [Zha Xiaodao] cautiously took down the mechanical eye and held it in his hand, looking in horror at the eye still spinning non-stop. At that moment, the pants pocket and [Manager Ji]'s car caught up, after a spin, the vehicles arrived back on the road covered in rainbow candy sprinkles. Both cars simultaneously slid and spun 360 degrees before coming to a stop on the road ahead filled with obstacles.
0:58:20|0:59:2|At this moment, [Zha Xiaodao] reached out of the window, frowned and said, "[Mo Feli], after listening, calmly took a sip of yogurt, then stepped on the gas pedal and rushed forward. Just as the vehicle was about to reach the obstacle, it reached a speed of one hundred and fifty miles per hour. The car leaped up the slope of the obstacle, soaring two meters high in the air. The two people in the air widened their eyes in fear, waiting for the car to land.
0:59:15|0:59:23|After successfully escaping, [Mo Feli] said to [Zha Xiaodao] while relieving himself in the woods:
1:0:0|1:0:7|[Mo Feli] absentmindedly covered his head.
1:0:24|1:0:28|[Mo Feli] looked at [Zha Xiaodao] with moist eyes, but said nothing.
1:0:44|1:1:7|As soon as the words fell, [Mo Feli] drove away quickly. [Zha Xiaodao], who was left behind, walked desolately on the straight road. Her expression was blank, her eyes unfocused, feeling that she was still not accepted by others.
1:1:7|1:1:23|In the car, [Mo Feli] was casually whistling, but as he whistled, his expression became somewhat reluctant, yet he still pretended to be indifferent. On the other side, [Zha Xiaodao], who was accustomed to walking in a straight line, slowed down, faintly hearing the whistling and the sound of the car behind him.
1:1:24|1:1:36|At this moment, Mo Feli's car swayed and drove up to Zha Xiaodao. The passenger door popped open, and Mo Feli leaned out, spraying water on the roof of the car. He casually said,
1:1:39|1:1:58|Zha Xiaodao swept away the gloom and nodded happily, then sat joyfully in the passenger seat with the window open. Meanwhile, Mo Feli was driving along the winding path in the quiet forest. In another scene, Hua Zong was welding with an electric welding gun in a factory, while Manager Ji and Zhe Ergen, who were not doing their job well, stood in front of the table, forced to watch the sparks flying during the welding process.
1:2:10|1:2:30|[Hua Zong] put down the welding gun and walked behind the two of them. They were holding their red eyes in pain. After speaking, he raised the sign just welded with an iron wire pattern of a bun. After speaking, he turned towards [Manager Ji], who was too dizzy to see clearly.
1:2:47|1:2:54|The indistinct Manager Ji scolded Hua Zong, also barely visible, saying:
1:3:5|1:3:16|The three of them excitedly opened the box, only to find a countdown bomb inside. As the countdown reached zero, the bomb suddenly exploded.
1:3:58|1:4:8|Following that, [Mo Feli] began training [Zha Xiaodao], starting with the Iron Head technique. After demonstrating with a prop brick, he pointed to the real bricks stacked in front.
1:4:8|1:4:20|Zha Xiaodao turned his neck and bumped into something. The next move was Iron Sand Palm, with Mo Feli poking twice into a pot filled with sand, then gesturing to Zha Xiaodao. However, in front of Xiaodao was a huge hotpot emitting steam, not what they expected.
1:4:20|1:4:32|In three steps, [Mo Feli] showed Zha Xiaodao his baseball bat skills, accurately hitting the bottle in the air and then handing the bat to Xiaodao. Xiaodao happily took the bat and the first swing landed on [Mo Feli]'s face. The third step was to train Xiaodao's accuracy.
1:4:32|1:4:50|[Mo Feli] pressed her hand on the table and skillfully and quickly stabbed the knife into the gaps between her fingers. After the demonstration, Zha Xiaodao, seeing Mo Feli's unharmed hand, also began to imitate and quickly stabbed her fingers. After a series of actions, Mo Feli raised her hand, revealing holes all over it. After the training session, Mo Feli and Zha Xiaodao warmly called the neighbors to join them.
1:4:50|1:4:56|In the courtyard, they started eating hotpot. Zha Xiaodao continued to practice martial arts, using his right hand to pick up vegetables from the hotpot for the neighbors. Everyone chatted and laughed, having a great time.
1:4:59|1:5:20|At night, Xiaodao stood by the only small window in the house, watching the heavy rain outside. Mo Feli handed a pair of glasses to Xiaodao, who took off the glasses given by his mother and said to Mo Feli:
1:6:34|1:6:47|After speaking, Xiaodao looked sadly out the window, and Mo Feli asked insistently:
1:7:13|1:7:22|[Mo Feli] nodded thoughtfully after listening, while Zha Xiaodao put on his glasses and shifted his gaze from the window to Mo Feli, asking:
1:7:49|1:7:57|Mo Feli begins to recall his childhood experiences.
1:9:0|1:9:7|[Mo Feli] and Zha Xiaodao looked out the window with a hint of sadness. While Xiaodao was still lost in childhood memories, [Mo Feli] walked over to the phonograph.
1:9:10|1:9:18|[Mo Feli] takes off the protective cover on the turntable head, unlocks the tonearm, and slowly places the needle on the record on the phonograph, causing the record to automatically rotate.
1:9:50|1:10:14|The two lay on the carpet, closing their eyes and listening attentively to the sounds of their childhood. When they opened their eyes, they both traveled back to the childhood of [Mo Feli]. In his childhood, [Mo Feli] had a fishbowl on his head, walking in the alley full of life. He watched the old man playing chess in the alley, the neighbor aunt cutting hair, and his classmates playing with sticks. Every corner around him was filled with emotions and nostalgia.
1:10:14|1:10:33|In the blink of an eye, he climbed up the wall, took the bell hanging in the house, and happily shook it towards [Zha Xiaodao] and the adult [Mo Feli]. [Mo Feli] smiled, tapped his head to his childhood self, and the young [Mo Feli] also tapped his head in response. The soft sunlight shone in the hutong, gently spreading in every corner, evoking a strong sense of nostalgia.
1:10:33|1:10:54|It turned out that time travel was just a dream shared by the two. The next morning, the weather was exceptionally good, with clear skies and a gentle breeze. The swing in the courtyard creaked as the wind brushed by. The dripping of the faucet was easily overlooked, yet these were the sounds of life. Inside the house, the little white dog ran over and licked awake [Mo Feli], who was sound asleep.
1:11:57|1:12:7|[Mofeli], who was eating walnuts, suddenly froze, unwilling to believe as he looked at [Zha Xiaodao], then turned to the fruit peel on the table. His expression gradually became fierce, his body trembling, and he spat out the half-chewed walnut.
1:12:47|1:12:56|At this moment, La Kudou walked into the courtyard with a locator. [Guo Sisi] held a photo of [Zhe Ergen] and asked [Zha Xiaodao]:
1:13:3|1:13:12|In the next room, Mo Feli is playing games and eavesdropping on the conversation between the two from time to time, while at this moment, Zha Xiaodao has successfully found Mo Feli's car.
1:13:51|1:13:59|Zha Xiaodao, who was knocked down, stood up and continued speaking with his back to Guo Sisi:
1:14:15|1:14:20|When Xiaodao turned around, he found Guo Sisi being choked unconscious on the ground.
1:14:33|1:15:2|Playing the game, [Mo Feli] was completely unaware of what was happening. The calm Zha Xiaodao picked up the iron box next to him and smashed it towards him. Xiaodao subconsciously glanced at the bag, laughed loudly after seeing Xiaodao's small movements, then without even looking, threw the bag out of the window. Suddenly, an abnormal vehicle alarm popped up on [Mo Feli]'s phone.
1:15:2|1:15:9|After the fat man Mo Feli struggled to climb out of the small window, he found that his bag had been taken by Manager Ji. They then returned to Hua Zong.
1:15:14|1:15:22|During the argument between the two, [Hua Zong] happily opened the bag, only to find it filled with paper money. It turned out that the money had been swapped out by [Zhe Ergen].
1:15:45|1:16:28|When [Zhe Ergen] switched the money and left a note inside the bag, [Hua Zong] read it and burst into laughter. Pointing at the name on the note, he realized what had happened. [Mo Feli] packed up the equipment and said to Xiaodao, "Just as he finished speaking, he looked up to see his car overturned. In the distance, the roar of an engine could be heard, a deep sound that made adrenaline surge. They looked in the direction of the sound and saw a luxurious two-seater sports car pulling up in front of them."
1:16:28|1:17:3|A man in a suit stepped out and said, "Just as he finished speaking, the driver lifted a small motorcycle from the trunk and rode it out, asking, "The driver handed the motorcycle to [Mo Feli] with a look of disdain, and then [Mo Feli] put on a helmet and goggles and sped down the road. Sitting behind him with a helmet on, Zha Xiaodao closed her eyes in fear, with her hands resting on [Mo Feli]'s shoulders.
1:17:3|1:17:23|Thinking that [Mo Feli] was driving fast, but constantly being overtaken by the car next to him, at this moment, a sexy girl on a large motorcycle caught up from behind. After riding side by side with the two, she glanced at [Mo Feli] wearing a green helmet and then accelerated past him. [Mo Feli] shouted at the girl in front of him, twisted the throttle to the maximum, caught up with her, and when the girl stopped at a red light, [Mo Feli] slowly pulled up next to her.
1:17:23|1:17:41|After taking off his sunglasses, Mo Feli whistled at the sassy girl, who smiled and winked at him. "You're a little slow," she said. Mo Feli hesitated for a moment, then turned his head slowly to look behind him. He saw Zha Xiaodao lying on the ground, struggling to stand up with one hand on his waist. Zha Xiaodao limped towards him.
1:17:43|1:17:46|Downstairs at the clinic, Manager Ji and [Mo Feli] are interrogating the neighbors.
1:17:50|1:18:11|On the second floor, [Zhe Ergen] looked flustered as he pondered a plan of action. He then went to the clinic, holding a photo, and compared it to the faces of the employees, interrogating them. The female nurse timidly finished speaking and then compared the photo to another employee's face, and then to the face of [Zhe Ergen], who was already dressed up as a nurse. With heavy makeup on, [Zhe Ergen] nervously cleared his throat and said:
1:18:15|1:18:22|At this moment, La Kudou found Mo Feli's ID card in the drawer, and Manager Ji snatched it away.
1:18:29|1:18:34|While the two were fighting, [Zhe Ergen] quietly ran out and bumped into [Mo Feli], who had just arrived at the gate.
1:19:8|1:19:21|[Mo Feli] shook off [Zhe Ergen]'s hand and said, "[Zhe Ergen]" ran back into the house in fear. [Manager Ji] took out a knife and said:
1:19:36|1:19:51|Zhe Ergen ran into the room, pulled the trigger, and the bag full of cash fell to the ground. At this time, Manager Ji in the courtyard had already been beaten up easily, lying motionless in the car. Pulling the trigger clapped his hands, turned around and said to Mo Feli:
1:20:13|1:20:22|As soon as the words fell, Zhe Ergen jumped from the second floor and landed right on top of Mo Feli's head. When Zhe Ergen got up, he anxiously said:
1:20:31|1:20:46|Unexpectedly, [Zha Xiaodao] knocked Zhe Ergen unconscious with an old method of using a stick. Later, in the restaurant, Xiaodao picked up a plate and ate voraciously, shocking the customers nearby. [Mo Feli] thought for a moment and said:
1:21:12|1:21:29|Mo Feli, with rice still in his mouth, stood up and approached the boss lady who was chewing gum disdainfully. He deliberately moved closer and adjusted his jacket before striking a pose, saying:
1:21:43|1:21:47|[Zha Xiaodao] bowed to the rough-looking men around him, then picked up his motorcycle helmet and said to the boss lady:
1:22:4|1:22:23|In the classroom, Zha Xiaodao's mother is teaching elementary students a lesson. Students in the back row seem to sense someone behind them, slowly looking out the window. They see Mo Feli outside the window, wearing a school uniform, a red scarf, and carrying a small backpack, floating past the window. After a while, he changes his posture and floats back like a ghost.
1:22:23|1:22:30|The students were all drawn to the quirky Mo Feli, looking at the window in surprise, while Teacher Zhang was still concentrating on reading the text.
1:23:37|1:23:42|After finishing speaking, [Zha Xiaodao] turned and walked back to the classroom. Feeling dejected, he lowered his head to leave, and [Mo Feli] walked over from the side.
1:24:0|1:24:9|Encouraged and commanded by [Mo Feli], [Zha Xiaodao] walked towards the classroom, at which point a naked child shouted:
1:24:22|1:24:30|[Zha Xiaodao] looked at his angry mother, took a step forward, lowered his head, and said apologetically:
1:25:1|1:25:21|After finishing speaking, [Teacher Zhang] looked at his mother, still unresponsive. With a stern face, he looked to the side. Lowering his head, [Zha Xiaodao] said, "After a moment of silence, he raised his head and looked into [Teacher Zhang]'s eyes, repeating the words he had always wanted to say. With tears in his eyes, [Zha Xiaodao] finished speaking and then turned and left. Full of melancholy, he followed [Mo Feli] towards the school gate. At this moment, [Teacher Zhang] caught up.
1:25:28|1:25:36|The two silent figures stopped in their tracks upon hearing this, turned around slowly, and [Teacher Zhang] quickly walked towards them. Before [Zha Xiaodao] could say anything, she was handed a bundle of cash. Before the two could react, [Teacher Zhang] had already returned to the classroom.
1:25:38|1:26:1|Back in the classroom, [Teacher Zhang] picked up the eraser in a daze. After dropping it on the ground, she hesitated and picked up the chalk to write on the blackboard. However, after just a few strokes, she didn't know what to write anymore. At this moment, the resentment towards her daughter in [Teacher Zhang]'s heart had dissipated, and the usually strong [Teacher Zhang] could no longer hide her love. She sobbed on the blackboard, and her body trembled along with her emotions.
1:26:2|1:26:11|[Teacher Zhang] wrote the title of the lesson "A Mother's Love" in big letters on the blackboard, and at that moment, all the emotions that had been bottled up for years in her heart were released.
1:26:11|1:26:26|As a mother, [Teacher Zhang] squatted on the ground and cried loudly. [Zha Xiaodao] stood at the school gate, looking straight ahead in the direction where his mother was leaving, tears falling from his eyes one by one. On the side, [Mo Feli] watched the mother and daughter reconcile, showing a relieved smile.
1:26:26|1:26:35|Regaining consciousness, [Zha Xiaodao] also smiled through tears. Meanwhile, in the company, [Hua Zong] was jogging with everyone applauding. Two employees were laying out a red carpet in front, with [Manager Ji] and pulling up their pants pockets following behind.
1:27:0|1:27:15|After that, he continued to run forward, and the disguised [Lao Ding] heard [Hua Zong]'s words and muttered to himself: Then he lurked into Sisi's inn, where Sisi was washing a guest's hair. At that moment, [Mo Feli] and [Zha Xiaodao] returned.
1:27:50|1:28:20|Guo Sisi, who rushed over, was knocked unconscious by a turtle shell. She said she would throw the turtle at Mo Feli, but it was caught by Lao Ding. After explaining the situation, Lao Ding sat on the ground and cried out to everyone.
1:29:41|1:30:6|[Mo Feli] turned his head slowly, looking at Zha Xiaodao with a determined gaze as he remembered the words he once said to him. Beside them, a poster of the movie "The Old Man and the Sea" displayed the bold declaration. Guo Sisi stood up first, nodding at Mo Feli with certainty. Everyone looked at Mo Feli's increasingly resolute expression and took a step forward together. As they entered the room, leaving everyone else standing there in a daze.
1:30:7|1:30:19|After seeing the situation, everyone dispersed. In the afternoon at Hua Zong's factory, many security guards, in groups of five, were patrolling closely with batons in hand. In a corner, Zha Xiaodao and Lao Ding were quietly planning.
1:30:40|1:30:47|[Zha Xiaodao] swiftly shuttles through the high and low platforms, [Lao Ding] watches [Zha Xiaodao]'s agile movements and secretly rejoices.
1:30:52|1:31:10|As soon as the words fell, [Zha Xiaodao], who had just been somersaulting, fell on the ground with all four legs up in the air. After getting up in a sorry state, he quickly got into position, hiding behind a large machine part, cautiously observing the situation outside. Seeing a security guard just a wall away, he prepared to go around from the other side. As he walked over, he tilted his head and saw another security guard passing by in the corridor.
1:31:10|1:31:31|Seeing security guards everywhere, [Zha Xiaodao] nervously backed away. At that moment, a man in a security uniform stood behind her. When [Zha Xiaodao] turned around anxiously with her mouth open, he quickly used a knife's teeth to open the bottle cap. After calming down, [Zha Xiaodao] realized that the person was actually [Mo Feli]. Subsequently, [Mo Feli] also changed [Zha Xiaodao] into a security uniform.
1:31:46|1:31:54|After speaking, [Mo Feli] took out his phone and started playing games.
1:32:9|1:32:15|Watching as Guo Sisi rushed into the room with her phone, she froze in place, looking fearfully at Hua Zong and the other two. Then, she quickly pretended to be blind, using her wits.
1:32:33|1:32:53|[Guo Sisi] saw initial success and boldly turned her head towards them, continuing to pretend to be blind and shouted: After saying that, she turned and walked away, only to be grabbed by [Hua Zong].
1:33:1|1:33:10|Facing the severe torture of having 10 fingers clamped with bamboo sticks and forcefully pulled, [Guo Sisi] still refused to reveal a single word.
1:33:38|1:33:46|The scene of finger pinching just now was from a video.
1:34:8|1:34:24|On the other side, [Mo Feli] and [Zha Xiaodao] have sneaked into [Hua Zong]'s office. [Mo Feli] looks serious, slows down his movements, and takes a step forward with his leg raised slowly. Seeing this, [Zha Xiaodao] immediately follows suit and takes a step as well.
1:34:46|1:35:5|At this moment, [Hua Zong] and a few others dragged [Guo Sisi] out. Just as they stepped out, they froze in place, seeing the neighbors holding pots and pans, ready to fight, blocking the entrance to [Mo Feli]'s house. [Guo Sisi] immediately became arrogant upon seeing this.
1:35:25|1:35:38|Just as [Guo Sisi] finished retaliating against the four of them and turned around laughing, she suddenly saw a large group of black-clad people rushing in from the doorway. Before [Guo Sisi] could close her laughing mouth, the neighbors were already surrounded, and [Hua Zong] and the others, brushing off their previous fear, became imposing.
1:35:38|1:35:46|Guo Sisi, sensing the situation was turning unfavorable, quickly came up with a plan and took charge.
1:35:47|1:36:11|Everyone followed the gestures of [Guo Sisi] and rhythmically tapped their pots and pans. When the music started, [Hua Zong] became interested and began to sway his hands, conducting along. Soon, the music stopped with [Hua Zong]'s final gesture. While [Hua Zong] was still enjoying with his eyes closed, the little girl started playing the pipa again, causing everyone to panic and look at her in confusion.
1:36:11|1:36:42|[Hua Zong] opened his eyes and impatiently pointed at the little girl's pipa. He walked up, grabbed the pipa from her pants pocket, and threw it heavily onto the old pipe above his head. The worn-out pipe broke under the impact, and a large amount of thick smoke sprayed out from the crack. In an instant, the entire inn was shrouded in thick smoke. In the courtyard where you couldn't see your hand in front of your face, everyone scattered and ran away. Unable to catch anyone, [Hua Zong]'s men angrily smashed everything in the courtyard. The homes where everyone had lived for many years were ruthlessly destroyed, even the big geese in the courtyard flapped their wings.
1:36:42|1:36:50|It's as if protesting, at the same time, the two in the office sat on piles of account books, flipping through them one by one.
1:37:16|1:37:22|At this moment, [Mo Feli] recalled the tone of voice used by [Hua Zong] in the wax museum.
1:37:33|1:37:53|As the secret door slowly opened, a glass wall filled with dolls appeared in front of them. [Mo Feli] excitedly pulled [Zha Xiaodao] to walk in and take a look. Inside the archive room, the two of them looked bewildered at the dazzling array of dolls. From front to back, they found nothing else except for the dolls. Just when the two of them were at a loss, [Hua Zong] and his men found [Zhe Ergen] hiding in the warehouse.
1:37:53|1:38:14|After catching his parrot, [Hua Zong] lay down next to the sleeping [Zhe Ergen]. With a snore, he turned over and his arm naturally rested on [Hua Zong]. Half asleep, [Zhe Ergen] vaguely felt something beside him. He reached out and touched [Hua Zong]'s big beard, then opened his eyes in shock. [Zhe Ergen], [Guo Sisi], and the parrot were tied to a chair. Speaking softly, [Guo Sisi] said to [Zhe Ergen]:
1:38:23|1:38:28|At this moment, his henchmen also found the hidden cash.
1:39:9|1:39:29|Seeing [Manager Ji] and Lao Kudou walking towards them, smiling and flipping their hair, they said in surprise as they approached, "Lao Kudou threw a punch." At the same time, the two in the dark room also got a clue. [Zha Xiaodao] picked up a doll and opened its base, revealing a ledger inside. [Mo Feli] saw it and also found a ledger in his doll. After a quick look, Xiaodao exclaimed:
1:39:37|1:39:45|At this moment, outside the office, [Lao Ding] is hiding in a corner, peeking through a crack. He sees the security guard passing by and reports the situation outside to [Zha Xiaodao] using his phone.
1:39:53|1:39:58|At this moment, the security guard heard the noise and discovered [Lao Ding]. Immediately, the security guards in the warehouse quickly assembled and swarmed out.
1:40:26|1:40:36|At this moment, a familiar voice reached Mo Feli's ears,
1:40:54|1:41:10|[Zha Xiaodao] habitually raised her hand to shield her head, but [Mo Feli] did not hit her. Instead, his expression was filled with joy and relief. After quietly watching Xiaodao for a moment, he slowly reached out and held her hand. Xiaodao, feeling his touch, looked up at [Mo Feli] in disbelief. After a brief moment, [Mo Feli] earnestly said:
1:41:37|1:41:40|At this moment, lively music suddenly started playing.
1:41:42|1:41:53|[Mo Feli] heard it and began to sway his body along with the music, looking at the shy Zha Xiaodao with a smile. He reached out his hand inviting her to join, and Zha Xiaodao slowly extended her hand, her cheeks blushing slightly.
1:41:53|1:42:26|Led by [Mo Feli], the two danced recklessly on the rooftop filled with neon lights. As Xiaodao danced more and more excitedly, he said, "[Mo Feli], watching Xiaodao dance wildly without any rules, showed a gentleness that had never been seen before in his eyes. With a slight smile on his lips, after staring at the silly Xiaodao for a while, he also joined in, following Xiaodao's dance steps and dancing wildly together.
1:42:26|1:42:42|[Zha Xiaodao] saw [Mo Feli] following him in dancing randomly, which made him even happier. The two of them jumped up and down on the not-so-big rooftop, sometimes splashing in puddles, sometimes waving the mattress. At this moment, they threw all their worries behind and enjoyed this moment of happiness that belonged only to the two of them.
1:42:42|1:42:49|During the time they got to know each other, the two of them changed each other, from initially disliking each other to becoming indispensable in each other's lives.
1:42:49|1:43:11|As [Zhe Ergen] said, the two of them were each other's medicine. After dancing for a long time, they lay on the rooftop with exhaustion and joy. Under the moonlight and neon lights, it seemed particularly romantic. However, not long after lying down, [Mo Feli] fell asleep. [Zha Xiaodao] stared blankly at the stars in the night sky, and it took her a while to come back to her senses. She looked at the snoring [Mo Feli] beside her, confirmed that he was asleep, and gently took out a decibel meter from her pocket, blowing on it.
1:43:11|1:43:30|After seeing Mo Feli not making a sound, Zha Xiaodao confirmed in a low voice, not without concern: "Mo Feli is motionless." Putting down the decibel meter, Zha Xiaodao said happily.
1:43:52|1:44:7|After muttering to himself, he turned very carefully to lie on his side facing [Mo Feli], gazing foolishly at [Mo Feli]'s face. After a while, he smiled happily and said:
1:44:16|1:44:30|After speaking softly, she raised her head slightly and looked at [Mo Feli]'s face. The eyes of [Zha Xiaodao] were full of affection and shyness as she pouted and said:
1:44:44|1:44:56|[Zha Xiaodao], blushing after confessing quietly, was about to go to sleep. At this moment, [Mo Feli] slowly opened his eyes and looked to the side, lips tightly closed, suppressing a smile of happiness. Suddenly, the vibration of the phone interrupted the two of them.
1:45:7|1:45:24|Picking up the phone, [Mo Feli] had a serious expression on his face. Then the two hurried back home, [Mo Feli] and [Zha Xiaodao] walked heavily step by step in the yard that looked like a ruin. They looked at the mess in front of them, the once lively and peaceful yard now devoid of vitality, everyone lying on the ground with varying degrees of injuries.
1:45:28|1:45:44|[Mo Feli] picked up a large bag of account books and slowly picked up the bell that had been stepped on the ground. Looking at the bell and then at the neighbors who were affected, [Mo Feli] suppressed the anger in his heart and walked to the crying child to comfort him when the phone rang.
1:45:58|1:46:19|Mo Feli, who couldn't contain his anger, gave Zha Xiaodao a meaningful look after hanging up the phone. Zha Xiaodao immediately understood and changed into the appropriate gear. The two of them hid the account book and without hesitation, they rushed over. Their expressions were particularly serious, filled with anger and the determination to seek revenge for their neighbors. Even though they knew the odds were against them, there was not a hint of hesitation in their actions.
1:46:19|1:46:27|Suspiciously, as they reached the entrance of the factory, [Mo Feli] grabbed [Zha Xiaodao], snatched the baseball bat and backpack, and said to the bewildered [Zha Xiaodao]:
1:46:44|1:46:50|[Mo Feli] handed a cloth bag to Zha Xiaodao, then went off alone. Xiaodao watched his back with concern, and when he opened the bag, he found a handgun inside.
1:47:14|1:47:43|Before La Kudou could finish speaking, [Zha Xiaodao] fell from the sky in front of the three of them. Taking matters into his own hands, [Zha Xiaodao] slowly got up and cautiously surveyed the surroundings, completely unaware that the enemy was right behind him. As La Kudou carried the unsuccessful [Zha Xiaodao] past the bound Zhe Ergen and the others, Zhe Ergen, Guo Sisi, and Lao Ding were all gagged, anxiously watching [Zha Xiaodao]. After a moment, [Zha Xiaodao] and the others were all bound in different locations according to the plan, in the complex factory filled with a large number of steel pipes.
1:47:43|1:47:57|[Hua Zong] anxiously called [Mo Feli], and at that moment, [Mo Feli]'s voice came through.
1:49:36|1:49:49|With a command from [Hua Zong], his subordinates all emerged from the shadows. In an instant, the empty factory was crowded with people, but his subordinates were occasionally tricked by the traps left by [Mo Feli]. At that moment, the words spoken by [Mo Feli] lingered in [Zha Xiaodao]'s ears.
1:50:25|1:50:49|At this moment, [Mo Feli] crashed through the iron gate in a car, causing [Zha Xiaodao] to shout in excitement. Dozens of security guards rushed over, wielding batons and charging towards [Mo Feli]. However, [Mo Feli] activated the self-driving mode, climbed out of the car, stood on the roof, and held four bottles of processed cola, laughing as the crowd approached.
1:50:49|1:51:9|Approaching, Mo Feli opened the switch, causing the carbon dioxide in the cola bottle to rapidly rise and spray towards the enemies like bullets. The careless henchmen were seen being thrown out one by one, falling to the ground in pain. As the cola bottle was depleted, a large number of henchmen were knocked down. At this moment, Mo Feli, who was well prepared, pulled the trigger and the trunk opened immediately.
1:51:9|1:51:25|A large amount of rainbow candy poured out, instantly forming a rainbow-like road behind the car. At this moment, the remaining henchmen chasing behind the car were caught off guard, slipping and falling heavily to the ground. [Mo Feli] cleverly and effortlessly dealt with dozens of henchmen, then elegantly jumped out of the car, carrying a baseball bat, and slowly walked towards [Zha Xiaodao] on the steps.
1:51:27|1:51:53|Smirking at [Zha Xiaodao] and striking a cool pose, [Mo Feli] then rescued [Zha Xiaodao] and ran outside. At that moment, [Hua Zong] and his men blocked their way. When they saw [Zha Xiaodao] pulling out a gun, the men who had just rushed out quickly retreated back behind [Hua Zong]. Seeing everyone retreat, [Mo Feli] confidently walked up to [Hua Zong] playing with a baseball bat.
1:52:18|1:52:40|With a gunshot, [Hua Zong] and the others crouched in fear on the ground. After a moment, they realized that no one was shot. They slowly stood up and looked down at themselves to confirm. Feeling something wrong with his body, [Mo Feli] turned slowly and saw a long needle stuck in his shoulder. [Mo Feli] turned around slowly, frowning, looking helpless and puzzled, and asked the bewildered [Zha Xiaodao]:
1:52:52|1:53:6|Before the words had even fallen, another needle was stuck in Mo Feli's neck. Mo Feli turned around again, pointing at the needle on his neck in disbelief, and asked, "
1:53:31|1:53:39|The people across the way laughed and picked up the sticks on the ground, and [Hua Zong] also laughed and said to [Zha Xiaodao]:
1:53:43|1:53:49|After a moment of thought, [Zha Xiaodao] raised his gun and loudly exclaimed:
1:54:8|1:54:28|After speaking, he hid behind his men and kept changing positions to provoke [Zha Xiaodao]. At this moment, the BGM that belongs to [Zha Xiaodao] plays again. Her brain rapidly calculates the distance, range, wind direction, and angle, forming dozens of formulas in her mind in just a few seconds.
1:54:28|1:54:34|After the calculations were completed, Zha Xiaodao slowly raised his hands holding the gun above his head, forming a perfect parabola.
1:54:47|1:54:56|Seeing Zha Xiaodao's precise marksmanship, his subordinates dropped their clubs in fear. At that moment, Guo Sisi led the others to arrive.
1:54:58|1:55:10|Guo Sisi strode forward with a cup of milk tea in hand, followed closely by Lao Ding holding a turtle. The neighbors came next, carrying brooms, and bringing up the rear were employees of Hua Zong. Hundreds of people marched behind Zha Xiaodao.
1:55:34|1:56:5|Standing in the room, [Zhe Ergen] shouted loudly, then threw a bunch of company bills towards the crowd. The papers fell like snowflakes. Seeing this scene, [Lao Ding] tightly held the bills and cried out in pain. His years of unsuccessful debt collection mirrored these snow-like bills. At this moment, [Hua Zong] covered his throat and said strugglingly before fainting on the ground. The thugs, seeing this, also held their heads and crouched down. After the villains received their retribution, [Zha Xiaodao] held the fainting [Mo Feli], while [Zhe Ergen] removed the needle from his head. [Zha Xiaodao] said:
1:56:29|1:57:1|Neighbors took away the heartbroken Guo Sisi, leaving only Mo Feli and Zha Xiaodao in the courtyard. Zha Xiaodao looked happily at Mo Feli and said, gently moving Mo Feli's head from his lap to the steps, lying down next to Mo Feli on the ground. After lying down, Zha Xiaodao lovingly looked at Mo Feli, then closed his eyes with a happy smile.
1:57:2|1:57:15|The factory, which was originally filled with constant noise, was unusually quiet at this moment, accompanied by the faint snoring of [Mo Feli] and [Zha Xiaodao].
