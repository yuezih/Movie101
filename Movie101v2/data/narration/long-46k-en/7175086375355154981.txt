0:0:53|0:1:14|Father returned to the room first, mother looked at her son standing at the door, splashed the dirty water from the bowl next to the son, placed the bowl on the table, gave the boy a glare, then also went back into the room. Leaving a young man alone at the door, he had a backpack on his back, a suitcase in his hand, standing lonely at the door.
0:1:20|0:1:45|Looking from a distance, smoke was rising from the short tiled houses of the man's family. The wheat fields at the door and the trees in the mountain valley behind the house were shining brightly. The man watched his mother close the door, and could only pick up his suitcase and leave. Walking alone in the wheat fields, he would occasionally look back at the door of his home.
0:1:45|0:1:49|As they walked further away, the title of the film "Returning Home" gradually emerged in the wheat field.
0:1:52|0:2:8|In the quaint courtyard, [Wang Youzhi] dragged a heavy suitcase across the threshold and into the courtyard. Approaching midnight, all was silent, only a few distant barks could be heard. [Wang Youzhi] looked around and surveyed the yard, noticing a faint light coming from a small door beside him.
0:2:12|0:2:28|[Ding Xiuxiu] walked slowly forward and saw a girl washing her hair in the courtyard behind the small gate. The girl seemed to have heard someone approaching and quickly walked away. So when [Wang Youzhi] approached the small gate and looked inside, the courtyard was already empty, with only two basins left behind.
0:2:33|0:2:43|As soon as the door was pushed open, they were met with a surprise - a man and a woman sitting inside. [Han Ailin] felt a twinge of guilt.
0:3:11|0:3:15|Serving a bowl of nicely presented noodles, explained to [Wang Youzhi].
0:3:18|0:3:23|[Wang Youzhi] is tidying up the bed, then hears a noise and goes to the table, bending down to smell it.
0:3:28|0:3:34|Han Ailin was still standing beside him, while [Wang Youzhi] asked Han Ailin while eating.
0:4:5|0:4:22|But with a rooster's crow, the sensitive morning light illuminated the entire village. [Wang Youzhi] was still sleeping inside the mosquito net, half-dreaming, half-awake, when it seemed like some noisy voices were coming from outside, only to hear a sharp female voice ringing out.
0:4:52|0:4:58|The couple finally quieted down, with [Wang Youzhi] sitting silently on the side, his face bearing a clear palm print from the slap that was just mistakenly deleted.
0:5:6|0:5:15|The village chief waved his hand to urge the two to leave quickly, but Wang Youzhi didn't even look at them.
0:5:31|0:5:37|The two of them left quietly. The village chief looked at them, shook his head and sighed, explaining.
0:6:34|0:6:49|At the entrance of the village committee, [Ding Dapeng] is seen standing in the middle of the road, attracting the attention of passersby. Just then, [Wang Youzhi] comes out of the village committee and strikes up a conversation. Dapeng stops and hands the apple in his hand to [Wang Youzhi], who is overjoyed.
0:6:50|0:7:7|[Wang Youzhi] picked up the apple and quickly ran away. A beautiful woman was sitting by the river, with the bamboo and her graceful figure reflected in the river. In the distance, [Wang Youzhi] ran towards the beautiful woman, who was still immersed in the beautiful scenery and had not noticed anyone approaching.
0:7:7|0:7:10|[Wang Youzhi] quietly approached behind the beauty and pretended to cover her eyes.
0:7:44|0:7:46|The two held hands and sat down, with [Wang Youzhi] about to kiss his girlfriend.
0:8:13|0:8:21|A middle-aged woman carrying a stele tower passed by and saw this scene.
0:8:39|0:8:43|[Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother gave [Wang Youzhi] a stern look, then gave her own daughter a disappointed look.
0:8:49|0:8:53|Receiving affirmation, [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother spoke thoughtfully.
0:9:2|0:9:6|[Wang Youzhi] started his visiting work, asking questions while taking notes, and even visited the school.
0:9:17|0:9:22|[Wang Youzhi] visits during the day, organizes materials at night, and goes door-to-door to inquire, leaving no family behind.
0:9:25|0:9:42|When it comes to [Ding Xiuxiu]'s home, everything is strictly following the procedures, even if [Ding Xiuxiu] is his girlfriend. Sometimes they even encounter those who pretend to be poor, like the couple [Wang Liang], who stop [Wang Youzhi] on the way and [Wang Liang]'s wife even pretends to cry with a bit of saliva as tears, wailing and shouting at [Wang Youzhi].
0:9:44|0:10:0|But [Wang Youzhi] did not waver at all, still treating the situation realistically, even though [Wang Liang] and his wife were still relatives. Finally, [Wang Youzhi] inquired about his own home, where his parents were still working in the fields. His father stood up straight when he saw [Wang Youzhi], but then lowered his head to continue working.
0:10:0|0:10:10|The mother also saw Wang Youzhi, but she just looked at him quietly without saying a word. Although Wang Youzhi was not understood by his parents, he still conscientiously worked for the village's subsistence allowance.
0:10:13|0:10:35|After the visit, he immersed himself in the active discussions at the village committee. Instead of drawing direct conclusions, he synthesized the opinions of other committee members to reach a final decision. [Wang Youzhi] and [Ding Xiuxiu] continued to interact as usual.
0:10:39|0:10:49|Once, the two crossed the river without an umbrella, so they had to use a bamboo hat for cover. A young man behind them offered an umbrella to [Ding Xiuxiu], but [Wang Youzhi] and [Ding Xiuxiu] ignored him and ran off embracing each other.
0:10:49|0:11:5|When it was time to announce the first protected quota, the villagers crowded in front of the notice board to check. The first name on the list was [Zhao Xiao'e]. At that moment, [Ding Xiuxiu] was busy in the kitchen at home. She finished cooking the dishes, packed them into a box, placed it in a basket, and then carried the basket out.
0:11:6|0:11:11|Unexpectedly, as soon as he left the house, he ran into his own mother and quickly hid the basket behind him, explaining.
0:12:34|0:12:53|After finishing speaking, [Wang Youzhi]'s mother took his dirty clothes and walked out of the door, with [Wang Youzhi] getting up to see his mother off. At this moment, [Han Ailin] sneaked into [Wang Youzhi]'s room, looking at the meal brought by [Wang Youzhi]'s mother, couldn't help but pick up the chopsticks and took a bite, nodding in approval.
0:13:18|0:13:24|At that moment, [Ding Xiuxiu] arrived. Seeing the intimate interaction between the two, she turned her head in anger and walked away.
0:14:59|0:15:11|The young man looked at Ding Xiuxiu, who was spinning yarn, and ignored him. He lowered his head to think of a solution. Seeing a bench nearby, Wang Liang politely held it out for Ding Xiuxiu to sit next to her, and said to Ding Xiuxiu.
0:16:49|0:17:4|After finally calming down Wang Jianguo and his wife, it was already dark. Wang Youzhi was studying in his own room when he was startled by a brick smashing through the window. He quickly got up and chased out, but only saw a figure flashing through the courtyard, which also startled Han Ailin.
0:17:36|0:17:49|The villagers scattered, and [Wang Youzhi] did not notice that [Ding Xiuxiu] was also among the crowd. Instead of calling out to [Wang Youzhi], [Ding Xiuxiu] quietly went to the back of the courtyard, only to be met with a shocking sight.
0:17:49|0:17:55|She saw [Han Ailin] sitting on [Wang Youzhi]'s bed folding clothes, [Ding Xiuxiu] once again left the village committee in anger, completely ignoring [Wang Youzhi].
0:19:1|0:19:10|After listening to the village chief's words, [Wang Youzhi] lowered his head and looked at the brick in his hand, lost in thought. At the bridge over the river at the village entrance, [Wang Youzhi]'s mother met [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother.
0:19:48|0:19:59|[Wang Youzhi]'s father failed to intervene and instead fell into the river. [Wang Youzhi] hurried home, only to run into [Wang Youzhi]'s mother carrying a basin into the house.
0:20:29|0:20:44|[Wang Youzhi] watched helplessly as his mother closed the door firmly. He stood there, unsure of what to do, but could still hear his mother's sobbing through the door. Like a zombie, [Wang Youzhi] turned around, let out a deep sigh, and walked away from the door.
0:20:46|0:20:58|And unbeknownst to him, this scene was witnessed by [Ding Xiuxiu] who had just arrived. She wanted to call out to [Wang Youzhi], but didn't know how to start, so she could only stand there dumbfounded, watching [Wang Youzhi] walk away.
0:20:58|0:21:8|In the evening, [Wang Youzhi] sat at the table, recalling recent events. It seemed like he had made a decision, as he slowly took out a pen and paper, and wrote down a few words requesting a transfer report.
0:21:14|0:21:33|Under the cover of night, [Wang Youzhi] sat alone on the steps, recalling the village chief's recent response. Bathed in moonlight, [Wang Youzhi]'s figure appeared particularly lonely, but the village chief's words seemed to have an effect.
0:21:33|0:21:41|The next day, [Wang Youzhi] arrived at the mayor's office early in the morning. At that time, the mayor was still busy approving documents, explaining to [Wang Youzhi] while working.
0:22:9|0:22:28|[Wang Youzhi] is wiping the handrail of the stairs. When the mayor comes out of the office, [Wang Youzhi] is mopping the floor at the door of the office. Wherever the mayor goes, he follows. The mayor is so frustrated that he turns back to the office. Unexpectedly, this behavior also angers the cleaning lady enough, she quickly finds the mayor to complain.
0:22:46|0:22:54|The mayor turned to look at [Wang Youzhi], who was wiping something, then turned back to the office. A while later, [Wang Youzhi], who was mopping the floor, was called.
0:22:58|0:23:4|[Wang Youzhi] excitedly put down the mop and hurried to meet the mayor.
0:23:46|0:23:50|The village chief was nailed in place by Wang Youzhi's words, answering in disbelief.
0:24:9|0:24:13|The village director sat angrily at the table in front of the village committee.
0:24:30|0:24:47|Wang Youzhi and Han Ailin got busy at the riverbank near the village as soon as they decided to take action. Wang Youzhi's mother, passing by the bridge, was delighted to see her son working hard. Unexpectedly, Ding Xiuxiu's mother, who wasn't paying attention to the road, bumped into her, and the two women started quarreling again.
0:25:0|0:25:15|[Wang Youzhi] looked at Yongzhi and [Han Ailin] planting on the wooden board of [Ding Xiuxiu] with satisfaction, and left happily. With the help of the children, [Wang Youzhi] and [Han Ailin] were working hard. The [village head] also saw them from a distance, but just sighed deeply and shook his head before walking away.
0:25:17|0:25:39|Unexpectedly, [Ding Xiuxiu] and [Ding Dapeng] also passed by the riverbank. Seeing the intimate interaction between the two, [Ding Xiuxiu] looked at them with a hint of anger in her eyes. It turned out that [Han Ailin] was wiping sweat for [Wang Youzhi], and [Wang Youzhi] wiped it back, which happened to be seen by [Ding Xiuxiu].
0:25:41|0:25:45|Watching the two playing around, [Ding Xiuxiu] angrily twisted her hand on [Ding Dapeng].
0:25:54|0:25:59|And [Wang Youzhi] was focused on the board, completely unaware of what was happening on the bridge.
0:27:15|0:27:47|The villagers scattered, even the officials like [Village Chief] crossed over [Wang Youzhi] and left the village committee. [Wang Youzhi]'s father scolded his worried mother, [Wang Youzhi]'s mother turned back step by step, looking back reluctantly at her son standing alone.
0:27:47|0:27:57|[Ding Xiuxiu] was the last one to leave. Before leaving, she looked deeply at [Wang Youzhi]. [Wang Youzhi] also hesitated, wanting to call out to [Ding Xiuxiu], but he couldn't get the words out before [Ding Xiuxiu] had already left.
0:28:0|0:28:14|[Wang Youzhi] looked at the courtyard that was just bustling with firecrackers and excitement, now empty with only himself left. He turned to see the countdown sign he had worked hard to make, sitting helplessly on the steps of the village committee, reflecting on everything that had happened.
0:28:28|0:28:51|Ailin looked at Ding Xiuxiu sitting alone in the empty neighborhood committee courtyard, full of pity, so she walked up and sat beside [Wang Youzhi], warmly encouraging her. Youzhi turned to look at Ailin, his gaze becoming determined.
0:28:52|0:28:57|The two of them hit it off right away, so they decided to start with the parents of the school.
0:29:34|0:29:41|Parents of the school students left one after another, but Wang Youzhi and Han Ailin still didn't give up. When the villagers saw them, they started running away.
0:30:2|0:30:17|Two people went door-to-door knocking, either being rejected or the door not being opened at all. Some even let out vicious dogs to chase them away. The two fled in panic, with the dog in hot pursuit. Ailin tripped and fell, and Youzhi had to carry her on his back.
0:31:0|0:31:5|Unexpectedly, [Ding Xiuxiu] and [Li Xiaobao] crossed paths, Xiuxiu angrily left while holding Xiaobao.
0:31:25|0:31:46|Xiuxiu completely ignored Xiaobao and walked away. Xiaobao was feeling regretful one moment, but the next moment he remembered Xiuxiu intimately linking arms with him and smiled happily. Ailin returned to the village committee, quickly took a shower, and was drying her hair as she walked out of the house. Unexpectedly, as she was drying her hair, someone suddenly threw a raw egg at her.
0:31:51|0:32:7|He held his hand up high, even thinking about throwing a second one. Looking at [Han Ailin] staring at him, he put down the eggs in his hand and timidly said to [Han Ailin].
0:32:7|0:32:18|After saying that, [Ding Dapeng] arrogantly turned around and left, leaving [Han Ailin] standing in place full of questions, not knowing what to do, looking at the egg liquid all over her head, and said speechlessly.
0:32:23|0:32:37|A man crazily splashes water from the river onto his head to wake himself up. Ignoring the heavy rain, he stands bare-backed on the river bank. Unable to bear it, a mother walks up to Wang Youzhi with an umbrella.
0:34:2|0:34:7|The next contestant appeared at the entrance of the Li Xiaobao Restaurant. Li Xiaobao was training waiters at the front desk.
0:35:53|0:35:58|[Wang Youzhi] gave [Li Xiaobao] a punch directly, and the two of them started fighting. Luckily, a waiter stepped in to break it up.
0:36:0|0:36:11|In the evening, [Wang Youzhi] returned to the village committee with a face full of injuries, touching the prop stone tablet he made, feeling powerless. [Han Ailin] ran over to ask him urgently. After speaking, [Wang Youzhi] sat down on the steps.
0:36:29|0:36:35|[Han Ailin] sighed deeply and sat down as well.
0:37:0|0:37:16|Under the cover of night, [Han Ailin] smiled as she looked at [Wang Youzhi], believing that things would be resolved. The next day, under the shining sun, the village was peaceful and tranquil, and the mountains bathed in sunlight appeared particularly majestic.
0:37:16|0:37:38|Villagers gathered at the village committee as they looked at the countdown sign showing the tenth day. There was a lot of discussion among them, and [The Village Chief] furrowed his brow, pacing back and forth anxiously, but still no sign of [Wang Youzhi]. At that moment, [Wang Youzhi] was still in his room, splashing cold water on his face repeatedly, trying to become more alert.
0:37:38|0:37:57|He looked up at himself in the mirror, with scars around his eyes and mouth, but his gaze was firm. [Ding Xiuxiu] also came to the village committee today, standing in the crowd looking worriedly at [Wang Youzhi]'s room. Unexpectedly, her eyes met [Han Ailin]'s, and [Ding Xiuxiu] immediately turned her head in anger.
0:38:8|0:38:13|The crowd became more and more agitated, with everyone below discussing animatedly, especially the couple [Wang Liang].
0:38:39|0:38:56|In the room, [Wang Youzhi] was still making final preparations. He put on his suit, tied his tie, and repeatedly adjusted his clothes in front of the mirror, as if psyching himself up. After a deep sigh, [Wang Youzhi] finally stepped out of the room.
0:38:59|0:39:15|With a sound of the door opening, the villagers stopped their discussions and became quiet, looking towards the source of the sound. [Wang Youzhi] walked out from behind the door, looking at the earnest faces one by one, observing carefully as if he would never see them again after this moment.
0:39:19|0:39:38|Wang Youzhi slowly walked through the crowd towards the stage, smiling at his parents as he passed by, reassuring them not to worry. With all eyes on him, [Wang Youzhi] stepped onto the stage, his gaze steady, facing the villagers. Instead of speaking immediately, he bowed deeply to the villagers.
0:39:53|0:40:1|The villagers looked puzzled, but they quietly waited for [Wang Youzhi] to speak. [Wang Youzhi] stood up straight and slowly began to speak.
0:41:16|0:41:24|The villagers lowered their heads in silence. [Wang Youzhi]'s father looked at the silent crowd, raised his hand first, setting an example.
0:41:25|0:41:33|Wang Youzhi's father walked out of the crowd, stood in front of his son, took out the money carefully wrapped in a handkerchief, and said to Wang Youzhi.
0:41:41|0:41:54|[Wang Youzhi] took the money handed over by his father with tears in his eyes. Before he could say anything, his father turned and left. Holding the heavy money, [Wang Youzhi] handed it over to the [village chief] in front of all the villagers.
0:41:59|0:42:10|[Wang Youzhi] did not answer the village chief, but directly pushed the money into the village chief's arms. [Ding Xiuxiu] in the audience couldn't stand it anymore, stood up and walked towards the stage. [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother hurriedly reached out to stop [Ding Xiuxiu].
0:42:28|0:42:48|[Ding Dapeng] nodded beside, reaching out to hold [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother. [Ding Xiuxiu] went up to the stage with the money and handed it to [Village Chief]. [Wang Youzhi]'s gaze had been following [Ding Xiuxiu], but unexpectedly, [Ding Xiuxiu] didn't even pause, not even looking at her, and walked off the stage without permission.
0:42:51|0:42:59|The auntie in the audience watched as [Ding Xiuxiu] donated money, feeling a glimmer of hope, and then shakily stood up, ready to donate as well. [Village Chief] quickly stepped forward to support her.
0:43:40|0:43:46|The aunt took out the money she was holding in her arms, some in coins and some in bills, showing that it was saved up little by little.
0:44:12|0:44:29|The villagers were greatly inspired and came forward to donate money. The road construction was finally put on the agenda. The road roller arrived in the village, and truckloads of cement were poured into the village, and the workers began their work. As the road roller passed by, the newly constructed cement road looked exceptionally wide.
0:44:29|0:44:38|[Wang Youzhi] and [Han Ailin] led the children to watch the construction team from a distance, watching the new road gradually taking shape, smiles appearing on everyone's faces.
0:44:39|0:44:45|The children laughed loudly, shouted, held hands, stomped their feet, and [Wang Youzhi] also shouted excitedly.
0:44:50|0:45:4|[Wang Youzhi] and [Han Ailin] embraced each other to share their joy. [Han Ailin] shyly lowered her head, while [Wang Youzhi], immersed in the joyous moment, didn't even notice the change in [Han Ailin].
0:45:15|0:45:42|[Han Ailin] looked at [Wang Youzhi] with a smile. Just then, [Wang Youzhi]'s father also came to see the progress of the road construction. Ailin took the children and left. After watching the children leave, [Wang Youzhi]'s father slowly approached [Wang Youzhi].
0:45:47|0:45:51|Looking at the road being constructed in the distance, Ding Xiuxiu slowly spoke to Wang Youzhi.
0:46:22|0:46:43|Father and son stood side by side, looking at the road under construction. The silhouettes of the two, one tall and one small, appeared particularly upright at this moment. [Wang Youzhi] had tears in his eyes, looking into the distance with a determined gaze, his expression unusually serious. He made a silent vow in his heart, determined not to disappoint his father's expectations and to make the village prosperous as soon as possible.
0:46:43|0:46:45|With the support of his father, [Wang Youzhi] is full of confidence.
0:46:48|0:47:0|That night, [Wang Youzhi] was hunched over her computer desk, writing something while looking up information on the computer. She was so focused that she didn't even notice Ailing appearing at the door of her room.
0:47:0|0:47:16|Ailing, wearing pajamas and holding a large water cup, hesitantly crossed the threshold, then stopped, straightened her clothes and hair, before carrying the water cup and walking lightly to the side of [Wang Youzhi]. She placed the water cup on the table, smiled, and spoke to [Wang Youzhi].
0:47:26|0:47:40|[Wang Youzhi] was so engrossed in writing in his book that he answered Ailing without even looking up, not noticing Ailing's change in mood. Ailin, seeing that [Wang Youzhi] was not paying much attention to her, immediately lost the effectiveness of her speech.
0:47:40|0:47:44|She came to find [Wang Youzhi] happily, but he didn't appreciate her advances and dared to leave on his own.
0:47:47|0:48:8|Ailin was a little angry, but seeing [Wang Youzhi] not even looking at her, she could only turn around silently and leave. When Ailin reached the door, she couldn't help but turn around to look at [Wang Youzhi] again, but [Wang Youzhi] remained unmoved. Ailin felt disappointed and could only leave with a low spirit.
0:48:8|0:48:14|Early the next morning, [Wang Youzhi] took the proposal he had written and found the [Village Chief] and several other leaders of the village committee.
0:48:16|0:48:24|Everyone carefully read the proposal written by [Wang Youzhi], and they all thought it was great. [The village chief] even praised it continuously.
0:48:53|0:48:56|The village chief shook his head and sighed, while Wang Youzhi smiled and spoke up beside him.
0:49:3|0:49:16|After speaking, [Wang Youzhi] quickly ran to [Ding Xiuxiu]'s house. Unexpectedly, as soon as he arrived at the door, he was stopped by [Ding Dapeng], who was holding a wooden stick with a ribbon tied to it. Seeing [Wang Youzhi] approaching, he directly pointed the stick at him.
0:49:20|0:49:31|[Ding Dapeng] arrogantly turned his head away and ignored [Wang Youzhi]. Wherever [Wang Youzhi] went, [Ding Dapeng] pointed his stick at him. [Wang Youzhi] came up with a plan and took out corn, [Ding Dapeng]'s favorite, from his bag.
0:49:34|0:49:53|[Ding Dapeng] saw the corn and his eyes lit up, [Wang Youzhi] approached step by step. Suddenly, the sound of a stick falling down came, [Ding Dapeng] quickly snapped out of it. He shook his head vigorously, then held the stick towards [Wang Youzhi], seeing no other way, [Wang Youzhi] had to shout loudly.
0:49:58|0:50:12|[Wang Youzhi] looked towards [Ding Xiuxiu]'s house, but heard no sound coming from inside. Feeling disappointed, [Wang Youzhi] saw no other way, especially with [Ding Dapeng] blocking the way. After some thought, he had no choice but to give up.
0:50:12|0:50:22|[Wang Youzhi] took out a plastic bag from his bag, wrapped the corn in it and placed it on the ground, indicating that [Ding Dapeng] would eat it later. After everything was done, [Wang Youzhi] reluctantly left [Ding Xiuxiu]'s house.
0:50:24|0:50:44|[Ding Dapeng] saw [Wang Youzhi] leaving, then looked at the corn cob he had already gnawed clean in his left hand and the fresh one on the ground. He happily threw away the one in his left hand, turned around, and picked up the corn on the ground. He started gnawing on it, making continuous chewing sounds, showing that he was enjoying the food.
0:50:44|0:50:49|He continued to guard his home while eating corn, holding a wooden stick as he stood watch.
0:51:2|0:51:17|[Wang Youzhi] didn't go far. He picked up corn in the greenhouse, but no one came out of the house. He was sure [Ding Xiuxiu] wasn't home, although he remembered something and took out his phone from his bag to make a call, only to hear the voice of an unreachable line on the other end.
0:51:28|0:51:40|However, at this time, [Ding Xiuxiu] arrived at the riverside where [Wang Youzhi] often had dates. [Ding Xiuxiu] stood there alone, looking upset, clearly angry with [Wang Youzhi].
0:51:40|0:51:47|[Ding Xiuxiu] had been alone for a while, and as she turned to leave, she unexpectedly ran into [Wang Youzhi] who had been looking for her.
0:51:54|0:52:9|[Ding Xiuxiu] saw [Wang Youzhi] and tried to run away. [Wang Youzhi] and his allies caught [Ding Xiuxiu] and didn't let her go. [Ding Xiuxiu] stopped struggling and let [Wang Youzhi] hold her.
0:52:51|0:53:0|[Ding Xiuxiu] stepped back, [Wang Youzhi] grabbed her hand and turned around with his back facing [Ding Xiuxiu]. [Wang Youzhi] gently touched [Ding Xiuxiu]'s nose bridge and explained.
0:53:47|0:54:6|The two had their previous grudges in the military, but finally made up. The sunlight at this moment was just right, shining through the kissing couple, spreading warmth, and everything was moving in a positive direction. The villagers' lives were becoming more prosperous, village facilities were constantly improving, and even the river at the village entrance became exceptionally clear.
0:54:8|0:54:26|The lush trees are reflected in the river, with sloping mountains in the distance complementing each other, resembling a picturesque pastoral painting from afar. [Wang Youzhi], inspired by [Ding Xiuxiu], also starts preparing for the issue of greenhouse vegetables.
0:54:26|0:54:37|[Wang Youzhi] shuttles between the township government and the village committee, working day and night to promote the success of the project. He handles everything with a light touch, such as going to the bank to secure loans and other series of small matters.
0:54:42|0:54:55|Finally, the village committee posted notices again. This time, the villagers became proactive, and the village committee became particularly lively, in stark contrast to the previous desolation.
0:54:55|0:55:8|That day, [Ding Xiuxiu] and [Wang Youzhi] came to the riverbank at the village entrance again. The two sat side by side on a stone, with clear river water in front of them and a crisp bamboo forest beside them. [Ding Xiuxiu] leaned on [Wang Youzhi]'s shoulder, and the two were talking.
0:56:30|0:56:38|[Ding Xiuxiu] could only find [Li Xiaobao], and the two sat in [Li Xiaobao]'s restaurant talking, with a hint of reluctance in [Li Xiaobao]'s expression.
0:57:20|0:57:37|In the greenhouse, after being asked by [Wang Youzhi]'s father, he nodded in satisfaction. In the evening, [Han Ailin] was washing clothes in the room. She finished washing and was about to go to the yard to hang the clothes when she met [Ding Xiuxiu] coming in with a basket of vegetables.
0:58:49|0:59:3|As the words fell, the spectacular cooking competition officially began. In a courtyard, ingredients and various kitchen utensils and seasonings were laid out in the center. Villagers sat around the courtyard, with the judges seated on a high platform. The competition was officially announced to start by [Village Chief].
0:59:47|0:59:58|Amidst the applause, [Han Ailin] and [Ding Xiuxiu] dressed in chef uniforms and chef hats, walked onto the stage with their assistants, [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother and [Wang Liang]'s wife.
0:59:58|1:0:7|[Li Xiaobao] and [Wang Youzhi]'s mother stood up first at the judges' table and applauded. [Wang Youzhi] was pulled up in a daze, staring wide-eyed at the two entering, extremely surprised.
1:0:10|1:0:22|Upon reaching their designated positions, Ah Ling and [Ding Xiuxiu] glared at each other disapprovingly, both turning their heads away in a huff.
1:0:35|1:1:7|The deceivers win this competition without a set theme, allowing the contestants to freely showcase their skills. I now announce that the competition has officially begun. With the command of the [Village Chief], the competition officially starts. Both sides immediately enter into intense preparation. From their chopping techniques, it is evident that both are seasoned hands, slicing the carrots as thin as cicada wings.
1:1:7|1:1:29|Even the green vegetables are finely chopped like hair strands. [Ding Xiuxiu] here prepared the jelly noodles, only to see the tempting jelly noodles being carefully cut into a small strip by [Ding Xiuxiu]. Xiuxiu's mother is also helping [Ding Xiuxiu] prepare the side dishes, finely chopping the green onions, then sprinkling them on the jelly noodles, accompanied by the appropriate sauce, just the thought of it makes one's mouth water.
1:1:29|1:1:38|Ailin chose apples, peeled and cut them into pieces, added other fruits, cooked them, added suitable sauce, and it looked sour and sweet.
1:1:42|1:2:6|Although it was a competition, everyone was at ease and in good order. The most nervous one turned out to be [Wang Youzhi]. Finally, the two finished the competition, plated their dishes, and presented them to the judges on the stage. [Li Xiaobao] was the first to taste, and he chose [Ding Xiuxiu]'s cold jelly in the inner plate.
1:2:6|1:2:9|The moment he entered, [Wang Liang] was stunned and couldn't help but praise.
1:2:14|1:2:30|Ding Xiuxiu's mother, after tasting the jelly noodles, did not speak, but instead tasted Ailing's fruit, and began to praise it the moment it entered her mouth.
1:2:30|1:2:43|[Wang Youzhi] looked at the two dishes in front of him, feeling indecisive. He glanced at [Ding Xiuxiu] and Ailin standing beside him. Just as he was about to taste Ailin's dish, [Ding Xiuxiu] coughed, and [Wang Youzhi] immediately switched his chopsticks.
1:2:43|1:2:50|Unexpectedly, Ailing coughed, causing [Wang Youzhi] to pause with his chopsticks, making the situation more difficult.
1:3:7|1:3:21|[Ding Xiuxiu] and [Han Ailin] returned to their seats, with [Han Ailin] looking nervous and [Ding Xiuxiu] looking expectantly towards the stage, both anticipating the final outcome. On stage, [Li Xiaobao] was the first to cast his vote.
1:3:37|1:3:44|[Wang Youzhi] threw one dart and actually lifted up the signs of two people.
1:3:56|1:4:15|After the [village chief] announced a tie, the second round of the competition started in full swing. Both sides chose to stir-fry this time, heating up the oil and sautéing the ingredients before adding the carefully selected ingredients. Soon, the aroma filled the entire courtyard. On the stage, [Wang Youzhi] watched the two busy figures and felt conflicted.
1:4:16|1:4:35|Without a word, the dishes from both sides were ready again and brought to the judge's table. This time, [Wang Liang] once again chose [Ding Xiuxiu], while [Wang Youzhi]'s mother chose [Han Ailin], putting the pressure on [Wang Youzhi]. After hesitating for a while, she finally crossed her hands and shouted out.
1:4:35|1:4:40|[Han Ailin] and [Ding Xiuxiu] both showed disappointment upon seeing [Wang Youzhi]'s choice, but they had to start preparing for the third round.
1:4:42|1:4:59|In the third round, both of them prepared soup. The audience couldn't sit still when they smelled the aroma, and they stood up one after another to peek into the pots of the two. In [Ding Xiuxiu]'s pot, eggs and tomatoes were mixed with a fragrant scent, topped with finely chopped green onions, looking tempting and increasing one's appetite.
1:5:2|1:5:17|While [Han Ailin] prepared a white bone broth, the aroma wafted through the air as she stirred, rich and refreshing, pleasing to the senses. Once seated at the judges' table, [Wang Youzhi] had not opened a single book, as the delicious food had not distracted her in the slightest.
1:5:17|1:5:24|But the audience below the stage was different. Around [Ding Xiuxiu], there were already villagers who couldn't resist the temptation, praising her.
1:5:34|1:5:48|The dish was successfully completed after the two of them carefully cooked it. After serving the soup, they once again brought it to the judges' table. The three judges tasted the masterpieces of the two in turn, all showing satisfied expressions.
1:5:48|1:5:59|Of course, except for [Wang Youzhi], who seemed frozen, expressionless, maintaining the posture of holding the bowl, sitting quietly in place, forming a stark contrast with the expressions of others enjoying the food.
1:6:1|1:6:17|This time, [Ding Xiuxiu] and [Han Ailin] were particularly nervous, their eyes following every move of the judges on the stage. They both knew that the result this time would determine the victory or defeat. As the voting began, [Li Xiaobao] unsurprisingly voted for [Ding Xiuxiu], while [Wang Youzhi]'s mother also voted for [Han Ailin].
1:6:17|1:6:24|The result was the same as the previous two rounds, and the difficult problem was once again given to [Wang Youzhi]. [Wang Youzhi] lowered his head and pondered, but after a long time, he still couldn't come up with a solution.
1:6:39|1:6:48|[Wang Youzhi] looked at [Han Ailin] with a puzzled expression. Unfazed, [Han Ailin] stood up and walked to the center, facing the judges' table, and spoke loudly.
1:7:4|1:7:29|The crowd was shocked, [Wang Youzhi] was also surprised, and [Li Xiaobao] even stood up directly and pointed at [Wang Huilan]. The people below all looked at [Wang Youzhi] as if they were watching a show, and [Wang Youzhi]'s mother was delighted. But [Wang Youzhi] was not happy at all, with his brow still furrowed.
1:7:32|1:7:51|At that moment, a torrential rain poured down, and everyone scattered to take cover from the rain. [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother also pulled [Ding Xiuxiu] away. Xiuxiu still wanted an answer, but she was dragged away by her mother. [Wang Youzhi] suddenly stood up, looking at the pouring rain as if facing a formidable enemy.
1:8:25|1:8:32|[Wang Youzhi] eventually fell ill, and all the villagers gathered at the village committee, shouting loudly.
1:9:6|1:9:9|Wang Youzhi's father, who was squatting on the side, stood up and spoke to everyone.
1:9:45|1:9:53|[Wang Youzhi]'s mother sat in the room, Xiuxiu and Ailin took turns changing the wet towels for [Wang Youzhi], looking worriedly at him lying on the bed.
1:9:57|1:10:5|After a while, the sick [Wang Youzhi] finally opened his eyes and struggled to sit up. Despite his mother's persuasion, he could only be supported by Xiuxiu as they helped him out.
1:11:18|1:11:24|[Wang Youzhi] fainted again, and Ding Xiuxiu sat by the bed taking care of [Wang Youzhi], only to hear [Wang Youzhi] murmuring.
1:11:45|1:11:52|Sitting by the bed taking care of [Wang Youzhi], Xiuxiu was moved to tears by Wang Youzhi's whispers, and she had already made a decision in her heart.
1:11:55|1:12:17|The next day, Xiuxiu came to the entrance of Xiaobao Restaurant, walked in and then walked out, hesitating at the entrance, pacing back and forth, unable to make up her mind. Coincidentally, Wang Xiaobao saw Ding Xiuxiu standing at the entrance, hurriedly and joyfully approached Ding Xiuxiu.
1:12:17|1:12:21|[Li Xiaobao] immediately understood the purpose of [Ding Xiuxiu]'s visit, and his smile disappeared instantly.
1:14:49|1:14:55|[Wang Youzhi] turned around angrily, but then turned back with a determined look and said.
1:15:3|1:15:18|[Wang Youzhi] left without a second thought after speaking, while [Ding Xiuxiu] had lost her previous arrogance and suddenly seemed deflated, like a balloon losing air, devoid of spirit. The sadness in her eyes could no longer be concealed, tears instantly filling her eyes.
1:15:18|1:15:28|In unbearable grief, but for [Wang Youzhi], she couldn't think of any other way. Chasing after them, [Han Ailin] watched the two figures getting farther and farther away, a hint of reluctance in her eyes.
1:15:33|1:15:48|Since [Ding Xiuxiu] decided to marry [Li Xiaobao], [Li Xiaobao] has been busy preparing for the wedding with [Ding Xiuxiu] and her mother. They first went to see the new house, and as soon as [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother entered, she looked around curiously, from the second floor to the first floor, with a smile on her face.
1:15:52|1:16:6|It is clear that Ding Xiuxiu's mother is very satisfied with this marriage, and Li Xiaobao is also diligent, always making Ding Xiuxiu's mother smile. Although Ding Xiuxiu has never smiled from beginning to end, she remains indifferent, unmoved by the beautifully decorated new house.
1:16:9|1:16:23|Later, the three of them went to see the diamond ring. [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother chose a big and shiny diamond ring, holding it in her hand and reluctant to let go. She called [Ding Xiuxiu] over to see, but [Ding Xiuxiu] showed no smile on her face, not even looking at the ring, as if she wasn't the one getting married.
1:16:28|1:16:43|[Li Xiaobao] and [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother took [Ding Xiuxiu] to try on wedding dresses again. [Ding Xiuxiu] walked past one wedding dress after another, without any hint of joy about getting married. Seeing her unhappy daughter, [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother's smile gradually disappeared, replaced by a touch of heartache.
1:16:43|1:16:56|She knew that marrying [Li Xiaobao] was not what [Ding Xiuxiu] willingly wanted. [Wang Youzhi] finally recovered from his illness, and the matter of the greenhouse vegetables was back on the agenda. She led the villagers to replant new vegetables.
1:17:2|1:17:20|[Wang Youzhi] has become busy again, as if [Ding Xiuxiu]'s marriage had no impact on him. He works during the day in the greenhouse, and at night he tirelessly handles various village matters. Finally, the greenhouse vegetables are showing progress. On this day, [Wang Youzhi] walked out of the greenhouse while talking on the phone.
1:17:33|1:17:39|[Han Ailin] walked over and looked at [Wang Youzhi], who had hung up the phone, and asked.
1:17:49|1:18:1|[Wang Youzhi] smiled and answered [Han Ailin], but the worried look in [Han Ailin]'s eyes quickly shifted. [Han Ailin] stood in place for a long time, while [Wang Youzhi] found [Li Xiaobao] with the advance salary and pushed piles of money in front of [Li Xiaobao].
1:18:26|1:18:42|On the day of the wedding, [Ding Xiuxiu] wore a white wedding dress, with a pure white veil covering her eyes, resembling a cold goddess statue, slowly walking into the church. At the end of the church stood [Li Xiaobao] in a white suit, with guests already seated on both sides.
1:18:45|1:19:6|[Wang Huilan] and [Ding Dapeng] sat in the front row, watching Xiuxiu pass by with joy on her face. Xiuxiu walked expressionlessly to the side of [Li Xiaobao], whose nervousness and excitement were all over his face. Unable to resist, he adjusted his suit jacket again and shouted.
1:19:6|1:19:10|Once the two of them stood still, the priest officially began the procedure.
1:20:3|1:20:18|[Ding Xiuxiu] can no longer hear the priest's words at this moment. Tears well up in her eyes as memories of the beautiful moments with [Wang Youzhi] flood her mind. The two of them used to hide from the rain under clothes, embracing each other, kissing, and all kinds of sweet memories come rushing back at this moment.
1:20:26|1:20:37|Perhaps it was the answer from [Ding Xiuxiu] after a long absence that made the guests feel something was wrong, and they all put on a serious expression. The smile on [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother's face also faded, and her eyes became watery.
1:20:37|1:20:45|[Li Xiaobao], who was originally praying with his eyes closed, became anxious when he didn't hear [Ding Xiuxiu]'s "I do" and tugged at [Ding Xiuxiu] in impatience.
1:20:50|1:21:15|[Ding Xiuxiu] turned to look at her mother, tears welling up in her eyes. Her mother's face was filled with worry. Meanwhile, [Wang Youzhi] had already packed his bags and was leaving home. He stood not far from home, waving goodbye to his parents, ready to head to a new city for development.
1:21:15|1:21:34|[Han Ailin] rushed over at this moment. She seemed to say something to [Wang Youzhi], who immediately dropped his backpack and ran off without looking back. Watching [Wang Youzhi] run away without any hesitation, [Han Ailin] displayed her sorrow vividly at that moment.
1:21:34|1:21:46|She stood still as tears rolled down her cheeks, knowing that her love was also falling apart. In the church, [Li Xiaobao] looked at [Ding Xiuxiu] with tears in her eyes, turned his back on her and said.
1:22:23|1:22:52|[Ding Xiuxiu] handed the bouquet to [Wang Liang], then quickly grabbed her skirt and ran out of the church towards her own happiness. Without looking back, Liang also saw Xiuxiu as a person. As [Wang Youzhi] ran towards the wedding venue, he recalled what [Han Ailin] had said earlier.
1:24:36|1:24:43|Both of them arrived at the place where the other had just been, only to miss each other again, unexpectedly even calling each other at the same time.
1:27:4|1:27:12|[Wang Youzhi] and [Ding Xiuxiu] finally met and got married. Meanwhile, [Wang Youzhi]'s university student village official professional cooperative society officially opened amidst the sound of firecrackers.
