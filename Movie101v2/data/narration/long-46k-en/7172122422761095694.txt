0:0:53|0:1:22|The chubby [Sun Yue] is wearing a Fuwa headgear, lying on the sofa covered with a blanket. She impatiently takes off the headgear and glances up and down. Standing at the corner of the stairs, [Guo Degang] peeks out with a book in his arms. Their contrasting personalities form the newly formed team.
0:1:22|0:1:24|The life of "Happy Comedy Man" begins.
0:1:40|0:1:43|On the stage, [Tai Wei] slowly turns around.
0:1:52|0:1:59|Tai Wei sat on the sofa and casually pressed the button on the remote control.
0:3:1|0:3:8|After switching channels, [Zhang Xiaofei] and [Ai Lun] stood on both sides wearing magician costumes, while [Sun Yue] was trapped inside a cardboard box in the middle.
0:3:58|0:4:1|And drew inspiration from some performance techniques in Southeast Asia.
0:7:3|0:7:16|The plane slowly landed, its wheels gliding slowly on the tarmac. Just now, the team accepted an invitation to come to Macau, starting a four-day, three-night trip. The team walked out of the airport handsomely, coordinated with the music.
0:7:16|0:7:22|The camera pans across, each of them walking confidently, all wearing sunglasses and pushing suitcases, each with their own style.
0:7:24|0:7:37|At this moment, two beautiful women walked towards them. They couldn't help but look at the women. [Zhang Xiaofei], however, refused to be outdone and compared herself to the women. Reluctantly, [Ai Lun] followed the women as they left. Seeing this, [Zhang Xiaofei] quickly pulled [Ai Lun] back.
0:7:39|0:8:5|The luxurious car parked at the entrance of the chicken farm had been waiting for a long time. The driver greeted them as they approached and took their luggage. As the team just got into the car, it smoothly shuttled through the streets of Macau, heading towards the luxury hotel. Inside the car, the team members enjoyed the luxury car and fine wine, raising their glasses to celebrate.
0:9:10|0:9:12|At this moment, someone in the co-pilot seat is holding a camera.
0:9:39|0:9:53|The team members looked at the camera, paying attention to their personal image. They put down their raised legs, pretended to be harmonious, clinked glasses to celebrate, and the sedan drove into the hotel, shuttling on the winding road. The exterior of the hotel was both luxurious and grand, standing proudly in the center of Macau.
0:10:24|0:10:36|At this moment, a hand holding a phone is secretly taking photos. The person squatting stands up, and it turns out to be the comedy master [Guo Degang]. He looks around with his phone raised, then suddenly, he looks towards the crowd surrounding the just-formed line.
0:10:41|0:11:2|Fans noticed that Mr. [Guo Degang] excitedly turned and ran out. The team members who had just lined up were no exception, they all excitedly ran to take photos with Mr. [Guo Degang], except for [Yue Yunpeng], who smiled and walked to the master's side while dragging his luggage.
0:11:28|0:11:44|Guo Degang left the reporters he had arranged for the shoot and walked away. The bustling streets of Macau were filled with people. In a magic shop, [Ai Lun] clumsily performed a magic trick, pretending to put a dove into his clothes and then taking it out again. The awkward magic trick didn't seem very clever, and the boss gestured to [Ai Lun].
0:11:52|0:12:8|A handsome guy is stretching his arms, showing off his figure. [Zhang Xiaofei] glances back and unexpectedly sees the guy showing his muscles, then she lowers her sunglasses, hoping to see more clearly. Meanwhile, [Guo Degang] is eating samples in the food area.
0:12:16|0:12:26|[Yue Yunpeng] looked at the salesperson with a face full of illusions, then took out a shopping list from his pocket. He showed off the list that couldn't be seen on camera to the clerk, who stared at him intently.
0:12:26|0:12:39|Arriving in Macau, Mr. Bean was curious about everything, picking up his phone and snapping away. Following Mr. Bean's camera, he arrived at the famous casino in Macau. [Tai Wei] was showing off his skills, all of which were secretly captured by a reporter.
0:12:52|0:13:6|On the other side, the manager did not teach [Ai Lun] how to do magic tricks, but instead tricked him into buying many expensive magic props. Inside the hotel, [Guo Degang] suddenly noticed someone taking photos behind him. He stopped and cooperated, but Mr. Handan unexpectedly pushed him away.
0:13:6|0:13:16|In fact, he was shooting the exhibit behind [Guo Degang], who awkwardly covered his face with a hat.
0:13:31|0:13:48|The handsome man groped for his party stick and got up to leave, [Zhang Xiaofei] pursed her lips awkwardly, while [Guo Degang] was busy shopping like crazy. At the casino, Zhang Tai lost all his chips, and inside the hotel, [Sun Yue] the journalist held up a camera to film the ice climbing tower. They stared into each other's eyes without any intention of admitting defeat.
0:13:48|0:13:51|At this moment, journalist [Sun Yue] took the initiative to break the meaningless confrontation.
0:14:1|0:14:3|Sun Yue, the journalist, quickly moved his neck.
0:14:12|0:14:20|[Pan Binlong] also took off his guard, slowly stood up, but due to not moving for too long, he directly knelt on both knees, so he simply crawled forward.
0:14:36|0:14:59|In the room, [Guo Degang] tears off a face mask and sticks it on the mirror, then writes on the mirror with his hand. In the bar, two beautiful women are sitting on a sofa, with the long-haired woman waving at her phone, while the short-haired woman next to her looks around with [Guo Degang]'s photo in hand.
0:16:54|0:17:5|Just then, the elevator door opened and Mr. Bean walked in as if nothing had happened. [Guo Degang] signaled to Mr. Bean for help, but Mr. Bean just gave him a thumbs up.
0:17:13|0:17:35|The beauties were very excited to see Mr. Bean. The long-haired beauty took out her phone and walked to Mr. Bean. Then, the short-haired beauty was responsible for grabbing [Guo Degang] in place with both hands. After getting Mr. Bean's permission, the two of them took a selfie.
0:17:35|0:17:40|The beauties changed positions, the short-haired beauty stepped forward to take a photo with Mr. Bean, while the long-haired beauty held onto [Guo Degang].
0:17:56|0:18:11|At this moment, [Guo Degang] appeared to be taking a group photo with the three people, but secretly pressed the elevator floor button. When the elevator doors opened, he threw away his phone and turned to run. As [Guo Degang] escaped from the elevator, he breathed a sigh of relief, but when he turned around, he bumped into the journalist Sha Wujing who was back to back with him.
0:18:25|0:18:43|Sandy the journalist, with his professional instincts, sensed something was amiss and immediately turned on his video camera to secretly record. He changed positions multiple times while recording, bored and dozing off on the sofa. Suddenly, a group of people marched up the stairs aggressively, led by a man in white with many bodyguards behind him.
0:18:44|0:19:3|Mr. Bean walked in front of them, accidentally spilling rainbow beans all over the ground. The group behind happened to be blocked by Mr. Bean, [Ai Lun] was quite impatient, so he decided to go around. But Mr. Bean seemed to anticipate the man's movements, always managing to block him in advance.
0:19:3|0:19:17|[Ai Lun] casually gestured to the bodyguards, who obediently took Mr. Bean away. Unbeknownst to the men, following behind were the two women who had just kidnapped [Guo Degang], while the cornered journalist Sand Monk captured everything on camera.
0:19:44|0:19:49|At night, the hotel lights were bright, but beneath this beautiful glow, there was a hint of danger.
0:21:45|0:21:49|Upon seeing them leave, [Zhang Xiaofei] immediately pressed the voice key on her phone and said:
0:22:18|0:22:40|[Yue Yunpeng] and [Pan Binlong] came to the massage parlor looking for [Guo Degang]. When [Yue Yunpeng] touched the massage bed, on the other side, [Zhang Xiaofei] went to the bathroom and stuffed all of [Guo Degang]'s face masks into her pocket. Then she picked up the expensive skincare products on the table and examined them carefully.
0:22:40|0:22:44|He then squeezed some onto his face, looking satisfied at his reflection in the mirror.
0:23:40|0:23:42|Pan Binlong opened up his imagination.
0:24:16|0:24:21|The beauty Mei Zhangwen fell to the ground, and another beauty was awakened and got up to check.
0:24:57|0:25:5|The male police officers went to check on the fainting beauty, while the female police officer drew her baton and knocked [Guo Degang] down on the chair with a blow, returning to reality under the female officer's reprimand.
0:26:19|0:26:28|[Ai Lun] got up and walked towards the bathroom, leaving the team members behind contemplating why [Guo Degang] had disappeared. Little did they expect that [Ai Lun] was actually taking a shower in the bathroom.
0:26:29|0:26:37|The water heater floats up, and then he notices the gradually appearing characters on the mirror, and then gets up to check.
0:26:42|0:26:45|He quickly called his teammates over for help.
0:28:18|0:28:26|The team members gathered around, looking at the keys they had just found in silence. Suddenly, [Ai Lun] slammed the table and said.
0:29:53|0:30:7|Seeing them getting up to leave, [Ai Lun] planned to follow, but [Zhang Xiaofei] firmly pressed him down on the sofa. The flashing lights in the bar, the beautiful women singing on stage, and the strong sense of rhythm made everyone involuntarily move their bodies to the music.
0:30:7|0:30:13|Meanwhile, [Yue Yunpeng], [Pan Binlong], and [Zhang Taiwei] also arrived at the bar, feeling the joyful atmosphere inside.
0:31:24|0:31:27|[Pan Binlong] shook the money in his hand as the waiter looked around.
0:31:43|0:31:49|After receiving the clue from the waiter, [Ai Lun], [Zhang Xiaofei], [Pan Binlong], [Tai Wei], [Sun Yue], and [Guo Degang] swayed their bodies to the music and walked towards the dressing room.
0:32:45|0:32:55|Ai Lun and Tai Wei, who were stopped by the security guard, were startled. Tai Wei turned around and knelt on the ground in fear. Ai Lun adjusted his mood, turned around and smiled, saying,
0:33:23|0:33:38|Shortly after, the two split up, and while the chaos ensued, [Pan Binlong] sneaked into the dressing room to search for the corresponding locker key. Just then, a sound suddenly made him quickly hide. He slowly moved along the wall, peeking out to see what was going on.
0:33:54|0:34:4|On the other side, [Yue Yunpeng], who was getting ready to go to the bathroom, kicked off the toilet seat cover and let out a sigh. On the stage, the performance by the beautiful female duo came to an end.
0:34:37|0:34:41|Zhang Xiaofei and the beauties followed the man to greet the boss.
0:35:25|0:35:30|Hu Zinan looked at [Tai Wei] seriously. In the bar, the lights kept changing and flashing.
0:36:34|0:36:51|[Tai Wei] was having a great time at the bar. Meanwhile, [Pan Binlong] finally waited until everyone in the changing room had left. He cautiously peeked out, looking around. [Pan Binlong] made sure the surroundings were safe. Only then did he follow the numbers on the keys and successfully found the corresponding locker.
0:36:51|0:36:58|He opened the cabinet and found a plan book, on which it was written prominently, I said [Guo Degang]'s plan book.
0:37:3|0:37:24|[Pan Binlong] opened the plan book and saw the contents inside, he quickly took out his phone. [Pan Binlong] carefully took photos of each page of the plan book with his phone. He found a suspicious receipt on the last page, which read "Macau Chef School".
0:37:24|0:37:30|[Ai Lun], who was in the bathroom, took out his phone and wiped it. He then opened the photo sent by [Pan Binlong] and carefully looked at it.
0:37:42|0:37:46|Suddenly, [Pan Binlong] found himself surrounded by the people who had just left the dressing room.
0:38:52|0:38:55|The daring [Yue Yunpeng] also escaped unharmed and was chased and beaten together.
0:39:39|0:40:4|[Yue Yunpeng] opens the fireworks machine, and the fireworks instantly spray out, scattering in the bar. The three quickly take advantage of the chaos to escape. [Pan Binlong], who escapes alone, casually picks up a bottle of mineral water from a roadside stall.
0:40:8|0:40:36|He ran while swinging the bottle of mineral water in his hand. [Yue Yunpeng] and [Zhang Xiaofei] hiding behind the stage took the opportunity to slip out and walk towards the middle of the dance floor. They found Haige lying on the ground, and [Zhang Xiaofei] reached out to feel Haige's breath.
0:40:47|0:40:58|[Yue Yunpeng] knelt beside Haige, checking his condition. [Yue Yunpeng] clasped his hands together, took a deep breath, and leaned down. He did not pour his mouth into Haige's mouth, just exhaled a breath.
0:41:34|0:41:39|They helped Haige up from the ground, and Haige put his hand on [Yue Yunpeng]'s shoulder. The next day, the weather in Macau was fine, and the team members in the restaurant were pondering over the receipt photo sent by [Pan Binlong] yesterday, which showed an amount of 56,000.
0:44:2|0:44:21|Pan Binlong was afraid that Tai Wei hadn't eaten enough, so he took another plate from the table. The scene shifted. They heard a noise and began to disguise their identities.
0:44:30|0:44:33|[Zhang Xiaofei] and [Guo Degang] listened uneasily to the chef's words.
0:45:15|0:45:19|[Yue Yunpeng] pushed open the door and picked up the shovel on the table, pressing it against the chef's neck.
0:45:49|0:45:59|The chef, under the coercion of [Guo Degang], moved to the side in fear, lifted the black cloth covering the cage, revealing two small piglets inside. [Guo Degang] froze in place for a moment.
0:46:39|0:46:44|The brothers threw vegetable leaves at [Zhang Xiaofei], who held back her anger and brushed off the leaves with her hand.
0:47:6|0:47:29|[Yue Yunpeng] had just finished speaking when he was also hit with vegetable leaves. [Zhang Xiaofei] and [Yue Yunpeng] were once again targeted with vegetable leaves, igniting [Zhang Xiaofei]'s anger to its peak.
0:47:39|0:47:53|[Zhang Xiaofei] fought with [Yue Yunpeng] and the chefs in the kitchen, vegetable leaves flying everywhere. At that moment, [Pan Binlong] arrived at the door. [Zhang Xiaofei] performed a sweeping kick, knocking down a chef. Suddenly, a cast-iron pot was thrown at him. [Zhang Xiaofei] used the force to send it back directly.
0:47:57|0:48:10|On the other side, [Yue Yunpeng] was sprinkled with pepper. While he and the chef were both coughing, the range hood sucked in all the dust, leaving them surprised. Hearing the commotion, [Pan Binlong] quickly left.
0:48:10|0:48:23|A group of people dressed in suits, wearing masks with [Guo Degang]'s face on them, blocked [Pan Binlong]'s path. Walking out from the middle was the short-haired beauty. In the kitchen, [Yue Yunpeng] was still dodging the flying vegetable leaves.
0:48:30|0:48:41|[Pan Binlong] was forced into a corner, and a short-haired beauty pushed him, then turned around and said. The masked person was about to put a bag over [Pan Binlong]. [Pan Binlong] quickly packed himself into the bag.
0:48:48|0:49:3|[Pan Binlong] was still captured, but his phone fell on the ground. Meanwhile, [Guo Degang] was still in the kitchen, engaging in a battle of wits. He was cunning, but accidentally fell onto the pig-killing table, where his feet and hands were firmly locked by the machine's iron clasps.
0:49:18|0:49:28|At this moment, the door opened and a big man walked out. [Zhang Xiaofei] also noticed the arrival of the head chef. The head chef slowly walked up to [Zhang Xiaofei] and said contemptuously.
0:49:34|0:49:43|[Zhang Xiaofei] replied without hesitation. "Go ahead," she said, clasping her hands together, ready to test the head chef's true skills.
0:49:45|0:49:58|Suddenly, the head chef's clothes were torn apart, revealing a golden belt tied around his waist. [Zhang Xiaofei] kicked a table over, and the head chef extended his fist to push another table, forming a rectangular shape with the tables.
0:49:58|0:50:8|At this moment, the two seemed to be in a boxing ring. [Zhang Xiaofei] took the initiative to attack first, but his punches and kicks were all blocked by the head chef, who then seized the opportunity to strike back.
0:50:9|0:50:31|The fist stopped just 10 centimeters in front of [Zhang Xiaofei]'s face. Zhang Xiaofei, unwilling to back down, kicked a carrot off the ground with her foot, only to be punched by the head chef and accidentally activate the machine. Other chefs quickly ran over to help.
0:50:34|0:50:53|The sharp knife kept moving upward, [Guo Degang] was in great danger, the chef alliance who bit the ear gestured to [Zhang Xiaofei] not to touch him. The chef pushed [Zhang Xiaofei] away, punched the machine, causing it to malfunction, and finally stopped.
0:50:57|0:51:10|Everyone cheered as the machine stopped, [Zhang Xiaofei] and the head chef also let go of their grievances and embraced each other. Still in shock, [Sun Yue] slumped on the stage. The door slowly opened, and [Zhang Xiaofei] and [Sun Yue] emerged from inside.
0:51:46|0:52:1|[Zhang Xiaofei] and [Guo Degang] found the phone that [Pan Binlong] had just dropped on the ground. They realized something was wrong, and at that moment [Sun Yue] arrived in Macau.
0:52:43|0:52:57|Suddenly, a business van stopped by the roadside, and the people who got off the car were also in suits, wearing masks with the image of [Guo Degang], with a long-haired beauty in the middle. The beauty gestured for them to walk towards [Ai Lun], [Sun Yue], and [Tai Wei].
0:52:57|0:53:5|Sun Yue slowly turned her head and looked at where [Ai Lun] was pointing, her eyes widened in surprise as they stopped in front of the three people.
0:53:9|0:53:22|[Ai Lun] and Zhang Xiaofei pointed directly at Sun Yue on the opposite side, the masked men received the instructions and immediately went forward to take Sun Yue away. [Ai Lun] and Zhang Xiaofei smoothly took Sun Yue's suitcase and cane, they watched as Sun Yue lay down.
0:53:35|0:53:52|The masked men first carried away the person on the top. The car started, and through the car window, [Guo Degang] in a bound mask was visible. The two lying on the ground looked around, then saw a bicycle being pulled not far away.
0:54:11|0:54:14|Ai Lun pedals the bicycle with all his might, struggling to stand up.
0:54:40|0:55:0|But whenever there is a woman in the house... Zhang Taowei in the car is warned by a woman. Suddenly, [Ai Lun] sees the business car taking Zhang Taowei away passing by in front, and he quickly pedals his bicycle to chase after from behind.
0:55:4|0:55:12|Suddenly, the front wheel rose together, it turned out that the bicycle fell backwards due to the heavy load. Sun [Yue Yunpeng] saw this and used his weight advantage to stabilize the bike as it landed.
0:55:35|0:55:56|[Ai Lun] looked pained, but still pedaled the bicycle with all his might. The man on the back seat and Sun [Yue] kept cheering [Ai Lun] on. On the other side, a black business car suddenly braked, and an elderly couple in wheelchairs were crossing the road. The long-haired beauty in the car fiercely elbowed the talkative Zhang [Tai Wei].
0:55:56|0:56:25|The rearview mirror in the car reflects [Ai Lun] who is desperately chasing. [Ai Lun] and Zhang Taifor observe the stopped business car. Zhang Taifor feels stupid for saying the wrong thing, and she slaps her mouth hard. The driver shifts to reverse, turns the steering wheel, and heads towards the three-wheeler to crash.
0:56:40|0:56:49|The business car accelerates forward, and at this moment, the camera slows down. [Ai Lun] faces the accelerating car, lifts the front wheels of the tricycle off the ground, makes an emergency U-turn, and the car lands smoothly on the ground.
0:56:53|0:57:11|The business car started chasing after [Ai Lun] and he had to continue pedaling the tricycle non-stop. The business car did not slow down at all and headed towards the tricycle. The tricycle was forced onto the steps out of control, and a brick on the road caused [Sun Yue] and the driver to fall off the back seat.
0:57:11|0:57:21|At this moment, the trunk and sunroof of the car opened together. The rickshaw driver who fell from the tricycle slid into the trunk, while [Sun Yue] landed accurately from the sunroof, dropping into the arms of [Zhang Xiaofei] inside the car.
0:57:25|0:57:42|[Zhang Xiaofei] in the car was grimacing under the sudden weight of [Sun Yue]. [Sun Yue] awkwardly greeted the people in the car, while the driver rolled out of the trunk onto the ground.
0:57:42|0:57:50|[Ai Lun] helplessly fell to his knees and wailed in despair, while on the other side, the frustrated team members returned to the hotel to discuss what to do next.
0:58:4|0:58:29|[Yue Yunpeng] picked up the golden hair gall on the ground, [Ai Lun] casually grabbed a vase, while [Zhang Xiaofei] hid behind him. They cautiously stood up and looked out of the room. [Yue Yunpeng] took the lead in poking his head out, with [Ai Lun] and [Zhang Xiaofei] following closely behind. [Yue Yunpeng] gestured for [Ai Lun] to go ahead.
0:58:36|0:58:48|The timid [Yue Yunpeng] nervously pokes the innocent bathtub with a chicken-hearted attitude. The three of them cautiously move forward to inspect the room, when suddenly a loud noise comes from the cabinet.
0:58:53|0:59:3|[Ai Lun] fearfully untied the rope on the cabinet. [Guo Degang] gathered up his courage and opened the cabinet door. Inside the cabinet was journalist [Pan Binlong], his hands and feet tied with rope, and his mouth gagged with a towel.
0:59:6|0:59:13|The three of them watched as the rescued journalist [Pan Binlong] voraciously devoured the sandwiches on the plate.
0:59:18|0:59:22|[Ai Lun] cautiously approached the sandwich on the table.
0:59:40|0:59:43|[Zhang Xiaofei] and [Guo Degang] immediately stood up straight.
0:59:45|0:59:53|[Pan Binlong] the journalist opened his phone and showed the team photos and videos of Chen Guokun going to find [Guo Degang].
1:0:58|1:1:9|The reporter nodded in agreement, with [Yue Yunpeng] in the front holding a phone, illuminating the surroundings. [Ai Lun] and [Zhang Xiaofei] followed behind, [Yue Yunpeng] checked the phone and found an address. They quickened their pace.
1:1:13|1:1:17|[Yue Yunpeng] and [Zhang Xiaofei] heard [Ai Lun]'s words and stopped. The three of them arrived at the door.
1:1:54|1:2:9|[Ai Lun] took off the backpack and unzipped it to find something inside. [Ai Lun] handed things to the other two. [Guo Degang] had a fierce expression as he struggled to put the stockings on his head.
1:2:26|1:2:35|The security guard on duty is Chen Guokun, who is dressed in a Pharaoh costume. Three people work together to tie up Chen Guokun, and they sit him on the sofa, looking bewildered.
1:2:51|1:2:54|Chen Guokun tried to escape, [Yue Yunpeng] stretched out his leg to trip him.
1:3:10|1:3:18|[Ai Lun] handed a big knife to [Guo Degang], who was sharpening the knife on his jeans.
1:3:41|1:4:1|[Yue Yunpeng] threatened Chen Guokun with a knife, who was frightened and quickly tried to please him. Chen Guokun, in despair, closed his eyes. [Yue Yunpeng] licked the blade with his tongue and accidentally cut his tongue. They looked in the direction of the sound.
1:4:16|1:4:32|Turning around, they were shocked to see a man dressed as Cleopatra, with heavy makeup on. [Guo Degang], [Ai Lun], and [Zhang Xiaofei] were all stunned and tears welled up in their eyes at the sight. They stood frozen in place as Cleopatra suddenly covered her mouth.
1:4:35|1:4:40|Chen Guokun regretted the situation and then they tied up the Egyptian queen.
1:5:12|1:5:17|[Yue Yunpeng] pushed them into the water, and their figures could be seen faintly outside the villa.
1:5:33|1:5:57|[Yue Yunpeng] is still torturing Chen Guokun and the Egyptian Queen. [Yue Yunpeng] wiped his hands and answered a video call, and on the other end of the call was the journalist Sha Wukong. The man on the video call looked exactly like Chen Guokun.
1:6:30|1:6:37|Ai Lun suddenly realized and clapped his hands. [Guo Degang] quickly helped them float up from the water.
1:7:3|1:7:18|Ai Lun and Zhang Xiaofei, who were soaking in the water, felt relieved. They then wearily collapsed into the water, while the three who had mistakenly grabbed the wrong person hurriedly fled.
1:7:22|1:7:24|[Yue Yunpeng] patted Ai Lun on the shoulder.
1:7:47|1:7:58|A pair of speeding jet skis broke the calm sea surface, gliding like a well-trained team in formation. The jet skis left water marks on the sea surface as they zoomed past.
1:7:58|1:8:10|[Zhang Xiaofei], Ai Lun, and [Guo Degang] were sitting on the back seats of a speedboat, the roaring engine creating huge noise as it sped across the sea. The splashing water beneath the speedboat, rolling continuously, seemed to foreshadow that all was not calm.
1:8:15|1:8:29|They ran to the bushes for cover. Ai Lun accidentally hit his glasses on [Zhang Xiaofei] while gesturing. [Zhang Xiaofei] looked at Ai Lun, pushed him hard. It was then that Guo Degang arrived panting, leaving under Haige's cover.
1:8:29|1:8:39|[Zhang Xiaofei] and [Ai Lun] arrived at the entrance of the villa. They crouched down to check the surroundings. At this moment, the exhausted [Yue Yunpeng], supported by Haige, also arrived at the entrance of the villa.
1:8:39|1:8:45|[Ai Lun] signaled everyone to keep moving forward, suddenly, many people ran out of the villa, all dressed in neat suits and wearing sunglasses.
1:8:51|1:8:57|Hai Ge, a younger brother, stepped forward and engaged in a fight with the men in suits, with both sides evenly matched.
1:9:6|1:9:19|[Yue Yunpeng], [Zhang Xiaofei], and [Ai Lun] screamed as they left. Haige coolly took off his sunglasses and threw them aside. On the other side, [Zhang Xiaofei] and [Ai Lun] finally found the villa where [Guo Degang] was located.
1:9:29|1:9:41|[Zhang Xiaofei] vigilantly observed the surroundings, while [Ai Lun] took off his backpack and surprisingly pulled out an ear scoop from inside.
1:9:55|1:9:58|Before long, [Zhang Xiaofei] was covered in all sorts of strange things.
1:10:4|1:10:12|The two beauties who kidnapped [Guo Degang] are now coming out of the villa, followed by two bodyguards.
1:10:16|1:10:21|[Zhang Xiaofei] overturned everything on her body and took care of the bodyguards rushing towards her with kicks and sticks.
1:10:22|1:10:36|[Ai Lun] watched as [Zhang Xiaofei] displayed amazing fighting skills and couldn't help but applaud. [Zhang Xiaofei] provocatively stared at the two beautiful women, who were not to be outdone and jumped off the steps. They split up, with the long-haired woman chasing after [Ai Lun] and the short-haired woman staying behind to fight with [Zhang Xiaofei].
1:10:36|1:10:44|[Zhang Xiaofei] and the short-haired beauty were at a stalemate, evenly matched and unable to determine a winner. Meanwhile, [Ai Lun] was forced to the entrance with no way out.
1:10:58|1:11:5|[Ai Lun] kept shuffling the cards in his hand, sending them flying towards the long-haired beauty. The long-haired beauty impatiently swatted away the flying cards.
1:11:16|1:11:31|On the other side, [Zhang Xiaofei] and the short-haired beauty were still fighting. They kicked each other's legs simultaneously and then tripped each other's upper bodies. The short-haired girl took the initiative and managed to trip [Zhang Xiaofei]'s leg first, causing [Zhang Xiaofei] to flip over her back in response.
1:11:31|1:11:36|[Zhang Xiaofei] and the short-haired beauty both let go of each other at the same time, they stood still, raised their fists and faced each other in battle.
1:11:45|1:11:53|The short-haired beauty shook her left hand. [Zhang Xiaofei] lifted her right foot and felt her painful left leg.
1:12:25|1:12:48|In the villa, a man who looks very much like Chen Guokun just came down the stairs. [Yue Yunpeng] suddenly grabbed the man from behind, tightly covering his mouth and preventing him from speaking. The man patted [Yue Yunpeng]'s hand on his mouth, signaling him to let go.
1:12:48|1:12:54|[Yue Yunpeng] covered the man's mouth again, at this moment [Zhang Xiaofei] and [Ai Lun] arrived in time and went forward to help.
1:13:5|1:13:25|Three people brought a man into a room, where captured team members lay on the bed. In front of one bed, someone with their back turned was well covered. [Guo Degang] rushed towards the person. [Guo Degang] delivered a flying kick to knock down the person, then ruthlessly kicked them several times, looking at the three people on the bed with sorrow.
1:13:29|1:13:32|Three people lying on the bed woke up one after another. [Guo Degang] slowly got up from the ground.
1:14:21|1:14:39|[Guo Degang] sat on the chair, waving his hand wearily. [Guo Degang] took a deep breath and started to reminisce. Inside the villa, [Guo Degang] and Chen Guokun sat on the sofa. [Guo Degang] glared angrily at Chen Guokun.
1:15:44|1:15:48|Later, Chen Guokun returned home to explain to his father.
1:15:58|1:16:4|Chen Guokun sighed and said, "Father said."
1:16:9|1:16:16|Hurry up and send the person back, [Guo Degang] stood outside the door and accidentally overheard the conversation between the father and son.
1:17:26|1:17:33|[Guo Degang] finally explained the misunderstanding, and the team members suddenly realized. [Guo Degang] explained that his subordinate handed a long spear to Chen Guokun.
1:17:58|1:18:8|Chen Guokun twirls a long spear, then thrusts it towards [Guo Degang], followed by [Guo Degang] pretending to be stabbed in the stomach.
1:18:21|1:18:37|The misunderstanding is finally resolved and the truth is revealed. Happy music is playing at the gathering, with the girls in gorgeous dresses making a beautiful entrance. Guests are chatting harmoniously on the grass, and men are expressing gratitude to the guests with clasped hands. Reporter Sha Song is still maintaining his professional integrity, sneaking around to take photos.
1:18:41|1:18:49|Mr. Bean walked over in long socks. Guo Degang gestured for Mr. Bean and Yue Yunpeng to learn Chinese.
1:19:10|1:19:21|[Mr. Bean] waved goodbye to [Guo Degang], as [Yue Yunpeng] maliciously walked up to him. [Mr. Bean] shook his head.
1:19:35|1:19:40|Mr. Han looked puzzled at [Guo Degang], then [Guo Degang] shyly said.
1:19:53|1:19:59|Saying that, [Yue Yunpeng] immediately bent down and bowed to Mr. Han Dao, who then affectionately patted his lowered head.
1:20:6|1:20:26|Mr. Han spread his hands, dancing with [Guo Degang], who disdainfully avoided his hands. Mr. Han looked at [Guo Degang] in confusion, then suddenly, as if remembering something, he searched his body and actually pulled out a pair of clappers from his pocket.
1:20:26|1:20:31|Following that, Mr. Han Dao proudly started to perform a fast-paced comic dialogue, with [Guo Degang] helplessly saying.
1:20:31|1:20:59|This is useless, you don't understand Chinese anyway. Mr. Hanno in Huaying Mountain Town... ignores [Guo Degang]'s advice and continues to perform his fast-paced routine. However, the board accidentally slips from his hands and hits [Guo Degang] in the chest. Seeing this, Mr. Hanno immediately flees.
1:21:1|1:21:29|On the other side, [Zhang Xiaofei] seemed to have learned his lesson this time. He reached out his hand and waved it in front of the handsome guy in sunglasses. The man slowly put down his glass, coolly took off his sunglasses, and asked. [Zhang Xiaofei] was captivated by the handsome guy, but it was okay. [Zhang Xiaofei] awkwardly smiled, then turned around and excitedly opened his mouth wide.
1:21:46|1:21:54|[Zhang Xiaofei] was about to take the business card when Mr. Handou suddenly snatched it away. [Zhang Xiaofei] had no choice but to chase after Mr. Handou with [Yue Yunpeng].
1:21:54|1:22:4|At this moment, [Ai Lun] next to him is watching the little boy in front of him perform magic. The boy makes the cloth in his hand disappear directly. [Ai Lun] is attracted by the boy's magic and can't help but clap his hands, even kneeling down and shouting.
1:22:34|1:22:41|Tai Wei and Sun Yue reached out to grab the camera from the journalist Sha Sun, Mr. Hano pushed Sun Yue from behind.
1:23:3|1:23:11|The team just disrupted the joyful atmosphere at the gathering. They chased Han Dou around at the party.
1:23:33|1:23:51|[Guo Degang] and Manager Wang looked helplessly at the team members. Mr. Handou fell to the ground, and Yueyunpeng pressed down on him. The team members and the journalist Sha Seng also piled on top. Sun Yue, who was at the bottom, was pressed down the most by Yueyunpeng and kept shouting in pain. Zhang Xiaofei was the last one to be pressed on top. [Guo Degang] looked shocked at the mischievous team members.
1:23:51|1:23:58|Mr. Hando, who should have been at the bottom, ran to the front of the camera instead, smiling cunningly, and then turned around gracefully.
