0:2:2|0:2:14|[Liu Yue'e] suddenly placed the sign tube on the ground, and a wooden sign popped out, flying into the air. She looked up, stood up, and caught the wooden sign, as the group walked out of the shop.
0:2:33|0:2:42|The title "There's a River East Lion in My Family" appears on the screen.
0:3:52|0:4:5|Chen Jichang watched the five girls leave thoughtfully. The scene shifted to Liu Yue'e, who was on a blind date at a restaurant with her brother and a man with a burly build and two twisted braids.
0:4:32|0:4:40|The two pushed the cup with force, spilling the wine.
0:5:1|0:5:7|[Liu Yue'e] also exerted force to splash the wine, and the two of them drank it all in one gulp. Yun Feiyang smiled and said,
0:6:29|0:6:40|[Liu Yue'e] turned around and glared at Yun Feiyang. The two of them locked eyes, creating a tense atmosphere in the tavern. Suddenly, the eldest brother raised his glass in an attempt to ease the tension.
0:6:46|0:6:55|[Liu Yue'e] knocked Yun Feiyang to the ground, left the tavern, and then jumped on Yun Feiyang's back to beat him forcefully.
0:7:0|0:7:5|Outside the tavern, chaos ensued as Liu Yue'e was lifted above the crowd by Yun Feiyang.
0:7:20|0:7:45|Yun Feiyang threw [Liu Yue'e] into the small river, but unexpectedly she landed on a small boat in the river. Yun Feiyang and his guards jumped into the river to continue the pursuit, while [Liu Yue'e] looked around. She picked up a washboard and threw it into the river, then leaped onto it, swiftly gliding forward by paddling with her right foot.
0:7:45|0:8:3|The spectators around the tavern applauded, [Liu Yue'e] waved in response, while Yun Feiyang and other guards behind her struggled to keep up, but the two were far apart in speed. This water chase extended from the side of the tavern to the Sanqiao Bridge.
0:8:3|0:8:12|The surrounding audience cheered and clapped continuously. [Liu Yue'e] stepped on the washboard with her feet, about to glide out from the middle bridge tunnel.
0:8:14|0:8:23|Suddenly, a guard emerged from the river in front of her, and [Liu Yue'e] swiftly flipped onto the stone bridge. She swung the washboard horizontally towards the side of the bridge, hitting the approaching guard and knocking him into the water.
0:8:24|0:8:31|[Liu Yue'e] chuckled lightly a few times, and the other guards continued to chase after her. She lifted the hem of her skirt and ran towards the bridge.
0:8:38|0:8:58|With a wicked smile, he lifted the lamp post and charged towards the guards. Swinging the lamp post horizontally, he knocked down many guards. [Liu Yue'e]'s elder brother and his servants arrived at the scene, drew their blades and swung them. Yun Feiyang then captured the elder brother from behind.
0:9:12|0:9:19|Yun Feiyang, after some consideration, took his big brother hostage and headed towards [Liu Yue'e].
0:9:27|0:9:35|He chopped at his older brother's arm, blood continuously spurting out. [Chen Jichang] walked forward to watch the commotion.
0:9:45|0:9:50|[Liu Yue'e] picked up the lantern pole and angrily rushed onto the stone bridge, causing everyone to dodge out of the way.
0:10:27|0:10:33|[Chen Jichang] opened the fan to cool himself down, suddenly heard a creaking sound behind him, and quickly turned around to look.
0:10:44|0:10:53|Chen Jichang suddenly fell down, and [Liu Yue'e] threw the lamp post aside, reaching out with both hands to catch Chen Jichang steadily, spinning around and embracing him, the two gazing into each other's eyes with tender affection.
0:10:55|0:11:17|[Liu Yue'e] looked up and down at Chen Jichang, showing a pleased expression. Chen Jichang then fell into her arms, and at that moment, time seemed to freeze, like a dream. They turned their heads and saw Yun Feiyang chopping at his big brother's other arm, causing blood to flow.
0:13:23|0:13:35|Chen Jichang bid farewell and left, while [Liu Yue'e] looked joyful, gazing deeply at his departing figure. The cool evening breeze brushed past the heat, as the palace was about to host Su Yongbang's recitation event.
0:14:2|0:14:16|With the crowd, [Liu Yue'e] entered the event venue carrying her nanny. As night fell and the lights came on, under the weeping willows, the [Emperor] sat in the main seat, waiting for the event to begin.
0:14:35|0:14:47|The event begins, the host dances and runs, goes on stage to start, waves and gestures for the audience to keep quiet.
0:15:0|0:15:26|Accompanied by the buzzing voices on the sidelines, numerous war drums resounded as the strongmen pounded them. On the wooden bridge, graceful and charming young girls, dressed in red with red drums around their waists, made a stunning entrance. Amidst the cheers of the fans, Chen Jichang, wearing a white robe, quietly appeared on stage.
0:15:31|0:15:37|Making a grand entrance, [Chen Jichang] greeted in different directions, causing a stir.
0:18:31|0:18:45|The Emperor also threw a stone, hitting Chen Jichang on the forehead. Dongpo stopped Chen Jichang, turned and ran towards the backstage, while Chen Jichang awkwardly started to perform.
0:19:37|0:19:46|[Chen Jichang] gazed intently at the only person interacting with him below the stage, [Liu Yue'e], ignoring the complaints of other audience members below. In his eyes, there was only [Liu Yue'e].
0:19:48|0:19:53|Chen Jichang was slightly moved, with tears shimmering in his eyes. He nodded slightly and began to sing slowly,
0:20:11|0:20:22|[Chen Jichang] also stood in the front, forgetting to sing.
0:20:34|0:20:52|The scene shifts to the celebration banquet, where the [Emperor], Dongpo, and many officials are mingling. [Chen Jichang] sits slightly apart from the group, and [Liu Yue'e] walks over to him. They nod to each other and awkwardly start a conversation.
0:21:17|0:21:23|Liu Yue'e seemed to sense his desolation, and after a moment of contemplation, sincerely said,
0:21:37|0:21:42|Chen Jichang looked at Liu Yue'e and smiled gratefully, casting a thankful glance.
0:22:15|0:22:20|Just as [Chen Jichang] embraced [Liu Yue'e] by the neck and launched the final attack, a voice sounded,
0:22:45|0:23:8|[Liu Yue'e] thought for a moment, with a slight smile on her lips, she looked up and said, "I am Liu Yue'e." As the suona music started playing, the two of them changed into wedding attire that evening and held a wedding ceremony. Under the escort of the guards, they walked to the wedding venue and paid respects to the [Emperor] and the dignitaries. They sat in the main seats one by one, seemingly enjoying the spectacle and receiving the bows.
0:23:8|0:23:23|[Chen Jichang] had a pained expression on his face, tears streaming down, while [Liu Yue'e] had a radiant smile, looking very happy. In the bridal chamber, one was full of joy, the other sat dazed at the edge of the bed. The scene then shifts to the next day,
0:23:39|0:23:50|Elder brother, cousin, and others were all stunned, looking at each other, while [Liu Yue'e] blushed and ran away shyly.
0:25:12|0:25:20|Liu Yue'e fell down stiffly with bandages wrapped all over her body.
0:25:25|0:25:35|[Chen Jichang] returned home with a group of people, when suddenly three women ran up and pulled [Chen Jichang] away.
0:25:52|0:26:3|Liu Yue'e angrily grabbed a person's headdress and threw them into the courtyard behind her. The other two people screamed and ran away. Liu Yue'e glanced at the stunned Chen Jichang and angrily walked into the courtyard.
0:27:20|0:27:25|Chen Jichang's mouth dropped open in astonishment,
0:28:8|0:28:15|In the market, [Chen Jichang] and his wife, Dongpo, along with a group of friends, sat together drinking and chatting.
0:28:23|0:28:28|[Liu Yue'e] looked at [Chen Jichang], who immediately restrained his expression.
0:29:36|0:29:50|Dongpo handed the feather fan to [Chen Jichang], pushing him towards [Liu Yue'e]. [Chen Jichang] timidly approached her. He looked back at Dongpo, who gave him a look signaling him to act.
0:29:51|0:29:56|[Chen Jichang] seemed to gather all his courage and gently tapped [Liu Yue'e] with a feather fan.
0:30:3|0:30:8|Dongpo dragged [Chen Jichang] away, then turned around and gave [Chen Jichang] a slap, saying,
0:31:5|0:31:31|Liu Yue'e walked subtly in the market, as if thinking about something, while Chen Jichang and others continued to enjoy themselves in the tavern. The scene shifted to the Su Mansion, where Liu Yue'e kicked open the door, and that night Su Yongbang arrived at Chen Jichang's doorstep.
0:31:44|0:31:51|The steward opened the door first and asked, [Chen Jichang] jumped out and said,
0:32:1|0:32:18|Dongpo stepped aside, with the Su family members behind him, all bound with bandages and bloodstained, standing unsteadily. [Chen Jichang] stood still, his brows slightly furrowed, scanning the people in front of him. He took a slightly heavy step past Dongpo and walked towards the crowd.
0:32:21|0:32:36|Su's family members were moaning in pain, some even fell to the ground due to exhaustion. Chen Jichang walked over one by one, carefully examining their injuries, and extended his hand with a look of apology, gently touching the injured areas.
0:32:36|0:33:2|With the broken arm girl in his arms, [Chen Jichang] gently patted her back. Family members were either wrapped in bandages or carried on bamboo chairs on their heads, but without exception, they all had varying degrees of swelling and bruising on their bodies. Some even had broken legs and were being carried on stretchers. He hurried forward, supporting and placing the person on the stretcher.
0:33:5|0:33:22|A chubby little boy with his head wrapped in bandages stood there looking aggrieved. Chen Jichang hugged him apologetically and tenderly, comforting him. Suddenly, he turned his head and saw his childhood beloved dog, Cuihua, also wrapped in bandages from being beaten.
0:33:24|0:33:30|He could no longer control his emotions, tears streaming down his face.
0:33:52|0:34:4|Su Dongpo handed a vine to Chen Jichang, who held it in his hand and walked into the room. Inside, Chen Jichang looked at Liu Yue'e with sorrow, waving the vine in his hand with force.
0:34:28|0:34:32|Accidentally, Chen Jichang really hit Liu Yue'e, causing him to retreat in fear.
0:34:50|0:34:53|[Liu Yue'e] raised a rattan cane and chased [Chen Jichang] out of the house.
0:36:28|0:36:36|Later, she began to recall the morning's experience, where in the chaos of the morning, [Liu Yue'e] overturned the dining table on the ground.
0:36:42|0:36:50|The crowd pointed fingers at the real culprit, while [Liu Yue'e] could only watch the chaos at the door and helplessly walked away.
0:37:20|0:37:40|[Chen Jichang] tremblingly took the knife handed to him, his lips quivering, and said with a sorrowful expression. Then he picked up the knife, jumped to the side of the bamboo mat, and accidentally threw it in front of [Liu Yue'e]. [Liu Yue'e] picked up the knife and split the bamboo mat with one stroke, also tearing open Madam Nine's clothes.
0:37:41|0:37:49|Liu Yue'e, with a clever look in her eyes, turned around and saw everyone picking up their belongings and fleeing.
0:38:4|0:38:11|Chen Jichang picked up the cane helplessly, raised it above his head, and handed it to Liu Yue'e, who then pretended to strike.
0:38:42|0:38:58|The butler closed the door, finally bringing an end to the matter. As the day broke, [Chen Jichang], who was confined at home, picked up his brush to start creating again. With a bandage on his head that read "inspiration", he struggled to find any inspiration to write.
0:38:59|0:39:22|Under the moonlight, [Chen Jichang] couldn't contain his desire to go out, howling at the moon. Upon hearing this, [Liu Yue'e] walked over holding a dog. [Chen Jichang] seized the opportunity and pretended, saying,
0:39:28|0:39:32|Liu Yue'e joyfully spoke to the dog,
0:39:36|0:39:51|In the room, [Liu Yue'e] took the stack of books handed over by the servant, and in a blink of an eye, she fell asleep holding the books. [Chen Jichang] came over and said to his wife,
0:39:56|0:40:8|[Chen Jichang] placed his wife on the bed, covered her with blankets, and laughed softly. He sneaked out of the room, closed the door, and ran towards the outside of the house.
0:40:31|0:40:39|[Chen Jichang] embraces the steward,
0:41:7|0:41:28|[Chen Jichang] ran out of the mansion, while the steward went to the room to release the smoke. He aimed the blowpipe at the smoke, but ended up fainting himself on the ground. The Arabian Night was in full swing, with dazzling fireworks, women in Arabian attire coming and going, creating a lively scene.
0:41:28|0:41:36|[Chen Jichang] walked through the crowd with a smile on his face, greeting the passing ladies. Suddenly, someone tapped him on the shoulder from behind.
0:42:50|0:43:6|Wildflowers blooming all around, [Liu Yue'e] weaves through them, searching for [Chen Jichang]. Among the tables and crowds, an Arabian girl in exotic attire dances with her belly exposed. [Liu Yue'e] watches the Arabian girl among the crowd, her face showing confusion and disdain.
0:43:6|0:43:19|Accompanied by music and dance, amidst the noise and laughter, it was truly lively. Unable to find what she was looking for, [Liu Yue'e] passed by an Arabian girl dancing inside the house. With a slightly angry expression, she turned back into the house, knocked the girl to the ground, and changed into exotic Arabian attire.
0:44:1|0:44:18|He happened to push [Liu Yue'e], who was wearing a veil, into [Chen Jichang], and [Liu Yue'e] pretended to be an Arabian girl, dancing in front of him.
0:44:38|0:44:55|The crowd scattered again, with [Chen Jichang] hiding under the table in fear. He cautiously peeked out and looked around before sitting back on the chair.
0:45:2|0:45:16|[Chen Jichang] tilted his head back and drank all the wine in the bottle, suppressing his shock. [Liu Yue'e] smiled with a hint of anger on her face. Turning around, the heavily intoxicated [Chen Jichang] was unconscious, being supported by two servants as they walked into the guest room of the tavern.
0:45:16|0:45:24|[Liu Yue'e] followed behind, swaying her hips as she entered the room. [Chen Jichang] was helped onto the bed, muttering to himself,
0:45:43|0:45:51|Liu Yue'e stopped helplessly upon hearing this.
0:46:27|0:46:36|[Liu Yue'e] placed her leg on [Chen Jichang]'s body, gently massaging his temples.
0:47:3|0:47:15|[Chen Jichang] frowned slightly, persistently speaking drunken words, while [Liu Yue'e] smiled at the corner of her eyes, gently stroking [Chen Jichang]'s head. She then leaned her head against [Chen Jichang]'s head, closing her eyes gently.
0:47:15|0:47:24|The next morning, the servants at home were cleaning the courtyard in an orderly manner. [Chen Jichang] rushed out of the house in a panic and ran towards the steward stumbling.
0:47:35|0:47:45|Liu Yue'e walked by, Chen Jichang quickly hid behind the steward, his eyes almost popping out in fear.
0:48:7|0:48:13|[Chen Jichang] hurriedly climbed the pillar and tried to escape outside the room. [Liu Yue'e] laughed at his silly appearance, and [Chen Jichang] quickly dodged away.
0:48:22|0:48:30|The steward handed over the cane,
0:49:22|0:49:29|In the palace, an [Imperial Physician] has been selected to test the medicine. [Emperor], the experiment report has been completed.
0:49:53|0:49:56|Adi placed the tea eggs in front of Afu,
0:50:30|0:50:35|[Su Yongbang], dressed in a purple robe, walked alongside the [Emperor] while fanning himself.
0:51:9|0:51:15|[Liu Yue'e] took the broadsword and was about to set off, but with just one word from [Chen Jichang], [Liu Yue'e] had to abandon the sword and return.
0:51:22|0:51:28|[Liu Yue'e] turned back angrily, while her elder brother and his servants timidly turned around and went back into the house.
0:51:57|0:52:18|[Liu Yue'e] placed her protective jade on the ground, lifted a brick, and smashed it down. The protective jade was directly crushed into powder, scattered by the wind, while the brick split into two, falling on the ground. Each person held one half of the brick, combined them into one, and chuckled foolishly.
0:52:27|0:52:36|[Liu Yue'e] turned and ran towards the carriage, while [Chen Jichang] held the brick against his chest, watching her leave.
0:52:41|0:52:48|[Chen Jichang] sits in the study, penning the title of his novel. He strokes his chin, deep in thought.
0:52:49|0:53:7|At this moment, in the deep night, there was no one outside, only the chirping of a few cicadas. Inside the room, [Chen Jichang] was deeply focused on his creation. Suddenly, a gust of eerie wind blew in, causing the papers beside him to rustle, the window to slam open, and the items on the table to scatter on the floor. [Chen Jichang] collected himself, rearranged the items,
0:53:7|0:53:24|He bent down to pick up the scattered manuscript on the ground, only to be surprised by a rabbit with its right foot injured and stained with blood. He gently picked up the rabbit, carefully examined its injured foot, and slowly looked up. After a moment of contemplation, he suddenly looked around.
0:53:24|0:53:54|As if suddenly remembering something, he suddenly shouted loudly, Chen Jichang called Dongpo over, Su Yongbang walked in, picked up the rabbit, set up the tableware on the table, and a Taoist priest lit straw with yellow talisman paper.
0:54:7|0:54:19|[Chen Jichang] went out to catch a rabbit, only to find the hemp rope on the ground had been broken free. He was very surprised, when suddenly a figure in white appeared behind him.
0:54:20|0:54:39|[Chen Jichang] turned around nervously and saw a woman with long hair covering her face and a right foot injury appearing behind him. He suddenly remembered the injured rabbit's foot, quickly looked her up and down, and stared at her carefully. In an instant, his brows furrowed and a look of distress appeared on his face.
0:54:53|0:55:2|Several people were about to go out to search, but they collided with the rabbit demon at the door and hurried back inside. The rabbit demon appeared again in front of them, and the group panicked and fled into a corner.
0:55:12|0:55:33|The Taoist sneaked in through the window alone, while the others were peering into the room at the door. Unexpectedly, the Rabbit Demon appeared behind them, but they were completely unaware. Upon seeing this inside the room, the Taoist quickly turned and ran, causing the others to nervously turn their heads to look behind them.
0:55:42|0:55:46|[Chen Jichang] shivered and huddled in the corner of the bed, as the rabbit demon approached the bed.
0:56:21|0:56:29|[Chen Jichang] looked somewhat reluctantly at the rabbit demon crying with tears in her eyes.
0:57:5|0:57:11|[Chen Jichang] stared blankly at the rabbit demon approaching closer and closer, until she pressed against his chest and lay down on the bed.
0:57:18|0:57:30|The next morning, the sky was bright, birds were chirping. Light gauze and shoes were scattered on the floor of the study, and two figures were lying flat on the bed. [Chen Jichang] suddenly woke up.
0:58:5|0:58:15|Princess Ping'an, dressed in exquisite attire after changing, walked slowly out of the room. Chen Jichang was stunned to see the courtyard filled with guards, his jaw dropping in disbelief.
0:58:42|0:58:53|During the break, the four guards have been standing outside the house on guard duty. The princess bent down, picked up a basin of wild flowers, and walked over to [Chen Jichang], handing it to him, saying,
0:59:6|0:59:17|Princess Ping'an turned away with a sorrowful expression. [Chen Jichang] put on his clothes in the room, picked up the half piece of stone, and returned home, leaving a pot of wildflowers on the desk.
0:59:22|0:59:33|[Chen Jichang] walked to the doorstep with a bag on his back, tidying his clothes as he walked, sniffing to see if there was anyone else's scent on him.
0:59:41|0:59:49|[Liu Yue'e] took off her bamboo hat, her face full of smiles, [Chen Jichang] looked at her affectionately and couldn't help but take two steps forward.
1:0:31|1:0:41|As the two walked towards the house, they were stopped by the steward holding wildflowers. Outside the house, Princess Ping'an and her servants stood waiting. Liu Yue'e was full of confusion.
1:1:12|1:1:17|Chen Jichang calmly replied,
1:1:49|1:1:54|Chen Jichang remained silent, bowing his head as the answer was about to be revealed.
1:1:56|1:2:8|Suddenly, the gate of the Chen family was kicked open by the guards of [Princess Ping'an]. [Princess Ping'an] walked in, but [Liu Yue'e] seemed to have not heard, with only red eyes, looking at the man she deeply loved in front of her.
1:2:15|1:2:32|Seemingly unbelievable, seemingly unwilling to accept, and deeply disappointed. [Liu Yue'e] gave [Chen Jichang] a deep look, then turned towards [Princess Ping'an]. The guard grabbed [Liu Yue'e]'s arm, and [Princess Ping'an] took the opportunity to retreat back into the courtyard. Despite the difference in strength, [Liu Yue'e] retreated back into the courtyard after a few moves.
1:2:32|1:2:52|She steadied herself and looked at her husband, but [Chen Jichang] did not speak up for his wife, only supporting his forehead with his hands, unmoving. Disappointed, [Liu Yue'e] turned and glared at [Princess Ping'an] in the distance. [Princess Ping'an] seemed somewhat aggrieved, standing among the guards. The two of them stared at each other from a distance, the atmosphere becoming somewhat tense.
1:2:53|1:3:7|The elder brother saw his sister being bullied, picked up a broom nearby, and flew towards [Princess Ping'an]. However, he was kicked aside by a guard, hit his head on the stone steps, and passed out.
1:3:9|1:3:16|Upon seeing his older brother injured, [Liu Yue'e] was immediately grabbed by the collar by the guards and thrown backwards out of the courtyard, kicking up a cloud of dust.
1:3:18|1:3:36|Outside the courtyard, [Liu Yue'e] stood up shakily with a disheveled appearance. She walked heavily, step by step, looking towards [Chen Jichang]. Anger, unwillingness, disappointment, all turned into two clear tears on her cheeks. Just as she was about to enter the door, she was stopped by the guards.
1:3:36|1:3:52|Chen Jichang seemed to want to escape from everything, just whimpering and squatting down, covering his ears, as if he was out of touch. Looking at the guards in front of him like a human wall, the angry Liu Yue'e clenched her hands tightly, with bulging veins, took a deep breath, and suddenly threw a punch.
1:3:52|1:4:11|Four guards made their move simultaneously, leaving [Liu Yue'e] outnumbered and forced onto the street. Facing the wall of people in front of her, she steadied herself, took a few steps forward, approached the guards, swiftly moved her feet, and stared straight ahead at the courtyard, hoping to find a breakthrough and return to her home.
1:4:11|1:4:30|She suddenly made a move, exchanging blows with four guards. After breaking through with difficulty, she was stopped by the guards. Unable to withstand the eight hands with her two fists, [Liu Yue'e] was barely defeated. After a series of fights, [Liu Yue'e] was running out of energy, leaning against a lamp post and panting heavily, while the street was crowded with onlookers.
1:4:30|1:4:44|[Liu Yue'e] looked at the guards in the distance, then glanced at the lamp post beside her. The confident [Liu Yue'e] seemed to have returned. She raised her eyebrows slightly, bent down to embrace the lamp post, and with both hands, she forcefully pulled it out, holding it in front of her as she charged forward.
1:4:47|1:5:1|Two guards flew onto the lamp post and kept spinning. [Liu Yue'e], being a woman, gradually lost control of the lamp post and was thrown out herself. The guards then put the lamp post back in its original position.
1:5:1|1:5:9|The other two guards acted together to capture [Liu Yue'e], rendering her unable to move, with a loss of spirit in her eyes.
1:5:12|1:5:26|In the prison cell, the disheveled [Liu Yue'e] sat on the ground, with sunken eyes and looking extremely miserable. A fellow prisoner beside her asked,
1:5:56|1:6:3|Liu Yue'e turned around and asked softly,
1:6:16|1:6:27|Deep in the palace, heavily guarded, a eunuch hurried over in the imperial garden and whispered something in the ear of the [Emperor]. After hearing it, the [Emperor] stood up slowly, looking slightly surprised.
1:6:27|1:6:44|The scene shifts to the entrance of the Golden Luang Palace of the [Emperor], with imperial guards in armor and carrying precious swords visible everywhere from the palace passageway to the outer square. They line up on both sides, all the way to the side of the [Emperor], exuding an imposing aura.
1:6:45|1:7:1|Walking through the gate and arriving at the square in front of the palace, the weary [Liu Yue'e] stood in the center, looking around with a tired expression. The Emperor and Empress sat on the main seats, with maids and eunuchs standing by their sides. On both sides of the square, the Imperial Physician cousin anxiously looked towards [Liu Yue'e].
1:7:1|1:7:16|[Chen Jichang], the eldest brother, stood slightly calm on the side. [Princess Ping'an] took the teacup and stood by the square, looking at [Liu Yue'e]. Dongpo walked up and said,
1:7:34|1:7:43|Princess Ping'an came to offer tea, and Dongpo quietly instructed her,
1:7:45|1:8:2|Princess Ping'an looked at Liu Yue'e with a smug smile. Under everyone's gaze, Liu Yue'e knocked over the teacup with a backhand, then stared blankly at the shattered cup on the ground. Princess Ping'an gave Liu Yue'e a disdainful look and angrily walked back to the Emperor's side.
1:8:2|1:8:10|[Emperor] looked on coldly at everything that was happening, then gestured for the Empress to speak.
1:8:37|1:8:43|Dongpo turned to look at [Chen Jichang], and the [Emperor] replied,
1:9:8|1:9:17|[Liu Yue'e] was on the verge of tears, sniffing back her emotions.
1:10:6|1:10:14|Suddenly, with yellow sand filling the sky, all the officials bowed down in submission, and [Chen Jichang] was pulled down to his knees by Dongpo.
1:10:17|1:10:38|[Liu Yue'e] stared defiantly at the [Emperor], only calming down after being comforted by the Empress. [Princess Ping'an] also offered consolation on the side, while the officials had to carefully observe and interpret the situation until everything settled down.
1:10:40|1:10:53|The crowd stood up one after another, only [Chen Jichang] remained kneeling on the ground. [Liu Yue'e] still stared straight at the [Emperor], who was momentarily stunned, and the atmosphere became tense again.
1:10:53|1:11:16|Dongpo saw [Liu Yue'e] in the square and exclaimed. Suddenly, a strong wind rose, sand and stones flew, and the entire hall was filled with sand and wind. The surrounding imperial guards raised their weapons and surrounded [Liu Yue'e]. [Liu Yue'e] clenched her fists tightly, stood in the field, and howled to the sky.
1:11:18|1:11:29|[Chen Jichang] just buried his head in the ground. In the raging wind, [Liu Yue'e] looked almost crazy, her hair dancing in the wind, and the surrounding imperial guards dared not approach to capture her.
1:11:30|1:11:53|The howling wind swept up dry branches, and fallen leaves danced in the air. The [Emperor] squinted his eyes as the royal umbrella beside him was blown down. [Liu Yue'e] became even more frantic, tearing at her hair as if trying to release all her grievances, tears streaming down her face. The roar dispersed in the wind, gradually fading away.
1:11:54|1:12:21|[Chen Jichang] buried his head even lower, as if he could no longer face [Liu Yue'e]. The square gradually returned to calm, with [Liu Yue'e] sobbing and shrinking her body, looking even more frail. Her tear-filled eyes were full of desolation, as she no longer held any hope for Chen Jichang.
1:12:52|1:13:11|[Chen Jichang] blended a thousand regrets into this sentence, leaving [Liu Yue'e] speechless and choked with tears streaming down her face.
1:13:27|1:13:35|Cousin [Imperial Physician] couldn't bear it in his heart, so he spoke up,
1:13:42|1:13:55|[Liu Yue'e] stood still, with a look of sorrow and indignation on her face. A maid held a tray and brought the Forgetfulness Water, pouring it into a cup. From afar, her elder brother shouted to her,
1:14:7|1:14:21|Liu Yue'e slowly closed her eyes, as if making a determined decision, glanced at the Forgetfulness Water, and held it in her hand. It was like a final farewell as she looked towards Chen Jichang.
1:15:43|1:15:50|[Chen Jichang] had a complex expression on his face, with a furrowed brow, but he raised his head firmly and said,
1:16:55|1:17:0|The eldest brother sat on the steps holding the dog, while the nanny leaned against the pillar, wiping away tears with a handkerchief.
1:17:1|1:17:17|Outside the courtyard, flowers are blooming in competition. The scene shifts to the room of [Liu Yue'e], who slowly wakes up and sits up in bed. Perhaps not fully awake yet, she then sits on the edge of the bed. A gentle breeze blows outside the window.
1:17:19|1:17:36|She stretched lazily with her hands behind her back. Perhaps the Forgetfulness Potion had taken effect, as she looked around with a hint of confusion, then dressed and walked out of the room. She saw her elder brother sitting dejectedly in a chair, and he was surprised to come to his senses.
1:17:37|1:17:50|Everyone looked at her in surprise, and they all gathered around her. She asked in confusion,
1:18:2|1:18:9|Upon opening the door, everyone's faces were filled with anger, except for [Liu Yue'e] who remained calm. [Chen Jichang] was seen standing at the doorway.
1:18:10|1:18:31|[Liu Yue'e] awkwardly patted the wet nurse, and upon hearing the call, a look of reminiscence appeared in her eyes. [Chen Jichang] anxiously looked at Yue'e, then took out the half brick from behind and handed it over, eyes full of anticipation, with a smile on his lips, hoping to awaken her.
1:18:31|1:18:44|Yue'e. [Liu Yue'e] seemed to remember something, she lightly stepped forward, walked towards [Chen Jichang], reached out and took the half brick, carefully examining it. However, [Liu Yue'e] suddenly smashed it towards [Chen Jichang].
1:18:47|1:18:54|Mr. Dongpo hurried over to support him.
1:19:14|1:19:28|[Liu Yue'e] seemed to have truly forgotten, casually throwing the brick on the ground, splitting it in half. [Chen Jichang] rubbed his forehead, picked up the broken brick, walked towards the tightly closed gate, and then helplessly turned back.
1:19:28|1:19:35|The crowd looked anxiously at the rejected Chen Jichang, but he suddenly had an idea and turned to place the ladder against the courtyard wall.
1:19:40|1:19:50|He hurried in with quick steps, climbing in through the ladder in just a few steps. As soon as he entered the courtyard, his elder brother led the family guards, brandishing weapons and surrounding him in the middle.
1:19:55|1:20:10|The courtyard door slowly opens, and [Chen Jichang] walks out with a dejected look. Dongpo and his friends watch [Chen Jichang], but he turns and runs away. Soon after, [Chen Jichang] joyfully throws a flying claw and then climbs into the courtyard.
1:20:11|1:20:25|He tugged on the rope to make sure it was secure, but the flying claw fell down, with his big brother's wig still attached to it. His big brother, feeling both embarrassed and angry, came out from the main gate, walked towards [Chen Jichang], and snatched the wig from his hand.
1:20:26|1:20:31|Big Brother rushed back to the courtyard, and a group of people including Chen Jichang gathered around.
1:20:55|1:21:15|People spread out a mat at the entrance of the escort agency, sitting on the ground and taking out roast duck and wine they brought, chatting and laughing. [Chen Jichang] looked at the tightly closed gate of the agency, sat down slowly, looking very out of place among the crowd with a heavy heart. He was determined to wait here until the end.
1:21:16|1:21:22|After an unknown period of time, the gate of the escort agency slowly opened, and a maid walked out and said,
1:21:26|1:21:39|[Chen Jichang] stood up in surprise among the crowd, who were sitting in all sorts of positions. In the living room, servants stood around, while [Chen Jichang] and [Liu Yue'e] sat facing each other.
1:22:32|1:23:7|[Liu Yue'e] walked away disdainfully, while [Chen Jichang] rushed towards Master Tian. However, he fell down when stepping off the stairs, and even his maid Xiaohu and the dog Beibei turned to follow the elder brother. [Chen Jichang] stood up abruptly, [Liu Yue'e] smiled politely, and the elder brother grabbed Master Tian and walked inside.
1:23:16|1:23:31|The group left the escort agency awkwardly. In the evening, accompanied by the distant chirping of cicadas, all the troubles seemed to have passed, only the rattan cane on the bed of [Liu Yue'e] still remembered the stories that had happened.
1:23:31|1:23:56|Wearing a red wedding dress, [Liu Yue'e] leaned against the window, looking outside, then turned back into the room. She gazed at her reflection in the water basin, gently touching her cheek, examining herself carefully. The next day, under the bright sun and gentle breeze, on the streets, groups of people in red attire carrying red silk walked in procession for a wedding. Onlookers quickly gathered around, basking in the joyous atmosphere.
1:23:57|1:24:14|The bride's sedan chair is being carried, positioned in the center of the procession, heading towards the destination with drums and gongs. In a room, the [Imperial Physician] is sitting in a wooden tub being bathed. [Chen Jichang] and his group arrive behind him with their faces covered.
1:24:16|1:24:21|The maid on the side was also scared and ran away.
1:24:23|1:24:42|Amidst the sound of firecrackers, the wedding procession arrived at the destination. [Su Yongbang] and his family stood outside the courtyard, beaming with joy. As the curtains of the bridal sedan chair were lifted, the bride stepped out, while [Liu Yue'e], [Chen Jichang], and others watched from afar sneakily.
1:24:42|1:24:59|[Chen Jichang] and the bailiffs, dressed in official robes, arrived at the sedan chair. The crowd hurriedly knelt down to receive the decree. On the side, [Liu Yue'e] pushed her friend, disguised as a matchmaker, forward. Clearing his throat, he approached the bride.
1:25:1|1:25:19|Turning around and carrying the bride on his back to avoid the gaze of the crowd, [Chen Jichang] walked unsteadily into the courtyard, relieved to see the plan proceeding smoothly. Inside the courtyard, after someone set the bride down, they immediately released smoke to make her faint. Outside the courtyard, [Su Yongbang] asked,
1:25:26|1:25:32|Young Master Tian nodded helplessly and continued to bow his head, only to see [Chen Jichang] running over with a plate of razor clams.
1:26:15|1:26:32|Chen Jichang hurriedly ran to the Daxiangguo Temple, made Liu Yue'e drink the antidote, but accidentally tripped on the way, the antidote flew out of his hand, Chen Jichang looked at the spilled medicine on the ground in despair.
1:26:38|1:27:1|[Chen Jichang] hurriedly got up and ran towards the Great Xiangguo Temple, clinging to the last glimmer of hope. The others followed, leaving [Imperial Physician] alone on the bridge. Just as they arrived at the temple, they were stopped by the guards outside. [Liu Yue'e] carefully identified them through the gauze window, finally recognizing them.
1:27:48|1:27:58|The crowd started to fight, almost overturning the registration desk. [Chen Jichang] took advantage of the chaos to grab a registration card and ran towards the preparation area, but the scene of powerful martial arts and large numbers of people shocked them.
1:28:3|1:28:9|Participants entered the scene one after another, with only Chen Jichang climbing using both hands and feet.
1:28:20|1:28:35|Watching the burly men in the arena wielding various weapons, [Chen Jichang] appeared visibly uncomfortable and nervous. He clumsily swung a short wooden stick, often dropping it. As the bell rang, the elder brother announced the rules of the competition.
1:28:54|1:29:10|The rules of the competition have changed suddenly, clearly targeting [Chen Jichang]. The group fight for marriage proposal has officially begun, with everyone on the field fighting together.
1:29:11|1:29:25|[Chen Jichang] shouted and rushed towards a muscular man, but he dropped his short stick and could only pat around with his hands. The man rubbed his wrist, knocked [Chen Jichang] to the ground, and knocked him out with a punch.
1:29:28|1:29:45|[Chen Jichang] staggered to his feet, his head still feeling heavy from the blow. He looked around at the chaotic scene, weapons swinging blindly, one after another falling down. He picked up the circular double-edged blade in front of him and attacked wildly as if he had gone mad.
1:29:45|1:29:56|The saying goes, "When brave men meet on a narrow path, the brave one wins." At this moment, [Chen Jichang] seems to have no fear, charging and cutting down one after another on the arena.
1:29:59|1:30:12|Suddenly stopping, he looked back at everyone. The scene was very quiet, and the others slowly stood up, glaring angrily at Chen Jichang, only to realize that their bodies, faces, and even their buttocks were covered in bruises.
1:30:12|1:30:28|Calm down, [Chen Jichang] once again felt fear, he turned to look at [Liu Yue'e], and sang,
1:30:36|1:30:55|On the stage, someone punched [Chen Jichang], followed by a two-person beating that knocked him to the ground. Surrounded by the crowd, [Chen Jichang] completely lost his ability to fight back. His eyes widened, seeming somewhat unwilling. He was not willing to stop at the last moment, and even more unwilling to give up [Liu Yue'e].
1:31:4|1:31:25|Dongpo and the steward saw the beaten Chen Jichang, calling out loudly, but Chen Jichang seemed to have not heard, slowly bending his body, tremblingly standing up again. Seeing this, the people around him delivered several punches that knocked him down to the ground again.
1:31:25|1:31:50|This time, even his willpower couldn't support him to stand up again. A chubby man in white clothes was applying foundation while speaking, then the fighting in the arena resumed. [Liu Yue'e] suddenly stood up and walked towards the edge of the arena, looking at [Chen Jichang] on the stage. In the distance, [Imperial Physician] and the general rode to the scene on horseback, and [Imperial Physician] spoke,
1:32:3|1:32:9|After hearing this, everyone quickly jumped off the stage, and Dongpo walked to the side of [Imperial Physician].
1:32:26|1:32:35|Perhaps it was Chen Jichang who touched his elder brother, and at this moment, his elder brother also helped him. Liu Yue'e and the audience below looked at Chen Jichang on the stage.
1:32:36|1:33:2|He slowly got up, still looking like a weak scholar, but his clothes were disheveled, with blood on his face. His elder brother began the countdown. He recalled the day when [Liu Yue'e] took the cane, and it seemed like [Liu Yue'e] also remembered that night, reminiscing with a turn of her head. [Chen Jichang] walked weakly on the stage.
1:33:2|1:33:12|Memories of the past come flooding back. As early as the storytelling event, the two of them were already chatting happily.
1:33:17|1:33:37|From that day on, the two seemed to have found the most compatible souls, even though there were unexpected events in life and vast differences in personality. But undoubtedly, their future had long been deeply intertwined, making it difficult to separate. With a naturally weak constitution, coupled with high-intensity exercise and physical injuries,
1:33:37|1:33:53|[Chen Jichang] took a step towards [Liu Yue'e], his eyes almost unable to stay open, relying solely on his determination. His elder brother, the wet nurse, and the maidservant all shed tears, hoping that [Liu Yue'e] could return to her original self.
1:33:53|1:34:10|Liu Yue'e gazed at Chen Jichang with affection, as if the frozen memories were gradually unfolding. Suddenly, the exhausted Chen Jichang knelt down and, using the last of his strength, whispered heartfelt words to Liu Yue'e.
1:35:10|1:35:26|The memories of the past came to mind, and he chuckled at the silly look of [Chen Jichang].
1:35:37|1:35:56|[Chen Jichang] had red eyes, tears welling up as he looked at Liu Yue'e. Hearing those words, tears streamed down Liu Yue'e's face.
1:36:3|1:36:10|With these words, [Liu Yue'e] cried uncontrollably, her resentment slowly dissipating.
1:36:29|1:36:36|Liu Yue'e rushed to the stage eagerly and embraced the fainted Chen Jichang in her arms.
1:37:10|1:37:16|Dongpo turned his head and asked the [Imperial Physician].
