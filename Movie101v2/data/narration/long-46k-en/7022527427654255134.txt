0:1:57|0:2:12|After the phone call ended, [Yang Fangfang] seemed to have lost her soul. She slowly lowered her phone, closed her eyes, and stared blankly ahead. Hearing that familiar voice again, her heart started to ache once more. What did this long-awaited phone call represent?
0:2:31|0:2:49|Outside the window, the street was brightly lit, with cars whizzing by. At this moment, [Yang Fangfang] looked at her reflection and was already immersed in that youthful memory. The high school student [Yang Fangfang] in school uniform was trying hard to reach for the tree branch outside the school building. She stretched her hand as far as she could, but still couldn't reach it.
0:2:58|0:3:6|She put away the letter and walked straight to the classroom.
0:3:35|0:3:42|Yang Fangfang, who immediately put away the letter, caught the attention of her desk mate, Guo Yang.
0:4:58|0:5:15|In her memory, she slowly walked down the stairs, feeling like a deer in headlights. When she reached the corner of the stairs, she stopped and peeked out. At that moment, [Guo Yang] was still standing at the intersection. She then tidied up the stray hair by her ear and walked out with her head down.
0:5:19|0:5:26|The two male classmates standing with [Guo Yang] immediately nudged him over when they saw [Yang Fangfang] coming out.
0:5:31|0:5:44|She walked straight ahead, listening to the faint footsteps behind her, feeling nervous. Then she quickened her pace, taking a few more steps until she heard no more sound behind her.
0:5:44|0:5:56|[Yang Fangfang] glanced back slightly, then turned around. [Guo Yang] who was following behind had already disappeared at this moment. She stood in place for a long time, feeling a sense of loss in her heart.
0:5:57|0:6:18|At this moment, [Yang Fangfang], who had just come to her senses from her memories, looked downstairs and suddenly saw her classmate Wu Xiaoyu being surrounded by a group of female students. They were pushing Wu Xiaoyu towards the direction of the woods. [Yang Fangfang] anxiously leaned out to check, then hurriedly ran out. Halfway there, she suddenly realized that she wouldn't be of much help on her own, so she ran back to the classroom to find reinforcements.
0:6:27|0:6:38|Hearing the news of Wu Xiaoyu's accident, Li Lin quickly ran down the stairs with [Yang Fangfang], while on the other side, the female thug was questioning.
0:7:24|0:7:38|At noon, all the students were doing radio calisthenics on the playground. After the activity ended, the sound of the school's loudspeaker could be heard.
0:7:58|0:8:10|In high school, student relationships always give the school a headache, but at this moment, [Yang Fangfang] even feels a bit envious. When she gets home at night, she takes out the letter written by [Guo Yang] and savors it again.
0:8:16|0:8:33|After instructing [Yang Fangfang], Mom turned around and gently closed the door, then walked to the living room. She pointed to [Yang Fangfang]'s room, glanced at Dad, and the loud laughter in the living room immediately stopped.
0:8:34|0:8:40|The next day, [Yang Fangfang] was accompanying Wu Xiaoyu to the restroom when the male classmate who had delivered the letter stopped her.
0:8:50|0:9:18|She snatched the envelope back from her male classmate, immediately opened it and smiled broadly. Reluctantly taking back the letter, [Yang Fangfang] walked towards the women's restroom while reading. During physical education class, the two of them rested in a shady spot by the wall. The smile on [Yang Fangfang]'s face was now replaced with worry, so she had to turn to Wu Xiaoyu beside her for help.
0:9:56|0:10:8|The only group photo came from a chance encounter during the National Day performance. The familiar profile in the photo triggered memories for [Yang Fangfang], while on stage, [Guo Yang] was wearing a white shirt, showcasing his talent to the fullest.
0:10:8|0:10:30|The perfect performance earned continuous applause from the audience. At this moment, [Yang Fangfang] lying on the bed tightly hugged her own photo album, already immersed in the memories of her crush on a boy, with a silly smile on her face. The next day during break, the inseparable sisters were eating snacks together, and Wu Xiaoyu leaned over to say to [Yang Fangfang],
0:11:20|0:11:28|On the way home in the car, Wu Xiaoyu's secret kept lingering in the ears, while [Yang Fangfang] secretly made up her mind.
0:11:57|0:12:21|Mom handed over a piece of paper while crying, [Yang Fangfang] took it and read the content on the paper, which was unbelievable. She turned around and asked, the mom in front of her was already in tears, and [Yang Fangfang] knew the answer in her heart. The sudden departure of her brother had brought a huge blow to this family.
0:12:21|0:12:29|Mom lay on the bed all day, washing her face with tears. Dad sat in front of the bed with untouched food in his hands, while [Yang Fangfang] stood by, at a loss.
0:12:38|0:12:52|At this moment, [Yang Fangfang] was too preoccupied to answer Wu Xiaoyu's question, anxiously looking around outside the taxi for her brother's figure. As time passed day by day, [Yang Fangfang] temporarily forgot about these troubling matters and a long-lost smile appeared on her face while playing with friends.
0:12:52|0:13:21|One day after school, [Yang Fangfang] walked home with an umbrella as usual. The rain was getting heavier, but she didn't quicken her pace. Slowly passing by a pavilion on the roadside, she glanced inside and unexpectedly saw a familiar figure. Her brother, who was curled up in a chair, slowly opened his eyes. [Yang Fangfang] forcefully pulled her brother's clothes, and he sat up grumpily.
0:13:21|0:13:36|Anxiously looking up at [Yang Fangfang], but seeing her tearful eyes, [Guo Yang] felt ashamed. After days of searching, they finally got a good result, and the burden in [Yang Fangfang]'s heart was finally lifted.
0:13:36|0:13:44|After the brother returned safely, life at home finally returned to normal, and [Yang Fangfang]'s thoughts also changed.
0:14:21|0:14:25|The form of the girl's secret crush is temporarily put on hold, only to become a better self.
0:14:53|0:15:16|During self-study class, bored Wu Xiaoyu poked [Yang Fangfang] in front of her with a pen, but [Yang Fangfang] was focused on studying and ignored her. The sudden power outage broke the silence, causing cheers and sighs when the power came back on.
0:15:46|0:15:54|[Yang Fangfang] insisted on having the myopia surgery, and no one could stop her. This fearless courage might be the strength given to succeed in becoming beautiful.
0:16:14|0:16:20|After the college entrance examination, [Yang Fangfang] finally came to the hospital for surgery.
0:16:43|0:16:53|[Yang Fangfang] sat on the operating table, silently encouraging herself. Then she immediately lay down, smiling as she stared at the machine above. The transformation surgery of the ugly duckling is about to begin. Step two, turn white.
0:17:2|0:17:9|[Yang Fangfang] chooses to believe in the effectiveness of the facial mask for now, closing her eyes and quietly enjoying it.
0:18:23|0:18:46|[Yang Fangfang] sighed softly, lowered her head in contemplation, obviously her brother lacked courage in this aspect. Perhaps she was just one step away from it herself. The girl on the platform watched her brother by the window from afar, but the train was already slowly moving away.
0:18:57|0:19:15|The platform gradually disappeared from view, leaving only the helplessness in the heart. No matter how reluctant the older brother was at the time, if he hadn't gotten off the train, there would have been no outcome. Time does not turn back, the train does not stop, hesitating to do what you want will make it difficult to have the initial enthusiasm, and not making efforts to see the person you want will ultimately become a missed opportunity.
0:19:15|0:19:48|[Yang Fangfang] may have known the answer in her heart. At this moment, [Yang Fangfang] is sitting on the bus back to the town, leaning her head against the window, looking at the green mountains and clear waters outside. A faint smile hangs on her lips as the village gradually comes into view. [Yang Fangfang] sits up straight and looks around, then she smiles and waves outside. The bus slowly stops by the roadside, and [Yang Fangfang]'s face is full of smiles. She has already picked up the backpack on her lap, ready to get off.
0:19:53|0:20:10|After exchanging pleasantries, [Yang Fangfang] and her friend walked towards the village carrying things. Passing by her childhood home, [Yang Fangfang] stopped and looked from a distance. Then she walked up the steps, looked through the window into the house for a long time, and turned to her friend beside her, saying,
0:20:12|0:20:19|The friend gave a perfunctory response, looking at the still reluctant Yang Fangfang, she quickly ran down the steps.
0:20:50|0:20:56|At night, while her friends were already fast asleep, [Yang Fangfang] was writing in her diary.
0:21:31|0:21:39|The boy who made faces at her from the back seat of the bicycle in her memory is [Guo Yang]. Only he knows the secret of leaving at one o'clock.
0:21:40|0:21:47|At this point, [Yang Fangfang] stopped writing and rested her head on the table.
0:21:51|0:22:22|She looked steadily at the diary in front of her, immersed in beautiful anticipation. [Yang Fangfang] stood on the dock, gazing at the calm lake in front of her. Whenever someone passed by her side, she would turn around to confirm if it was [Guo Yang]. Wearing a white dress, she looked around on the shore, hoping to see that long-awaited face at some moment.
0:22:29|0:22:40|Her eyes never left every corner of the shore, a few lights were visible in the windows of the houses by the lake, she had looked carefully, but she couldn't see the figure of [Guo Yang].
0:24:49|0:25:6|The questioning from her friend made [Yang Fangfang] flustered. She mumbled a few words, but her friend didn't pay much attention. Later that night, the two of them arrived at the snack street.
0:25:16|0:25:32|Upon hearing someone calling for a friend, [Yang Fangfang] turned her head and found the person standing opposite to be the long-awaited encounter. Following her friend, [Yang Fangfang] walked while using her hand to wipe away the residue on her face.
0:25:47|0:25:54|[Yang Fangfang] didn't know how to respond, she exchanged glances with her friend.
0:26:51|0:27:10|Inexperienced Yang Fangfang scratched her head in confusion, and in order not to dampen the mood, she bravely raised her glass and took a sip.
0:27:47|0:27:51|After a night of drinking and chatting, the next morning everyone got into a car together for a day trip.
0:28:11|0:28:25|The water rafting made everyone cheer and scream, [Yang Fangfang] sat in the boat tightly holding the handle, while [Guo Yang] was sitting opposite paddling gracefully.
0:28:30|0:28:36|During the conversation, their small boat accidentally hit the shore. With [Guo Yang] around, [Yang Fangfang] didn't feel scared.
0:28:59|0:29:21|As they reached the narrow passage, the water suddenly became turbulent. The small boats of the group rushed down the stream, creating waves and screams that filled the entire valley. At this moment, the last boat was also approaching a steep slope. [Guo Yang] smiled and said to [Yang Fangfang],
0:29:23|0:29:53|Accompanied by the screams of the two, the small boat plummeted down with the rapids. [Yang Fangfang] was already so scared that she didn't care about her image, her fearful screams echoing through the valley. Just as they reached a calm spot, the small boat started to lose control. A sudden accident occurred as the boat got stuck in a whirlpool and capsized, sending [Yang Fangfang] drifting along with the water flow.
0:29:53|0:29:55|Guo Yang hurriedly swam over and lifted her up.
0:29:55|0:30:17|At this moment, in a panic, [Yang Fangfang] clung to [Guo Yang] like clutching at a life-saving straw, tightly holding onto his neck and leaning her body upwards. [Guo Yang] held her around the waist and swam towards the shore. In her most desperate moment, [Guo Yang]'s strong protection gave [Yang Fangfang] a sense of security. Her inner vulnerability and grievance couldn't help but burst forth at this moment.
0:30:17|0:30:32|Guo Yang was already exhausted by the time they reached the shore, he staggered to carry Yang Fangfang ashore, but the hands around his neck refused to let go.
0:31:3|0:31:12|After the emotions calmed down, [Guo Yang] carefully reminded and supported the petite [Yang Fangfang] to the bridge. The smiles returned to their faces.
0:31:22|0:31:31|But as long as she could follow him, [Yang Fangfang] felt at ease. She was shy and didn't dare to look up on the way, while [Guo Yang] broke the silence first.
0:32:31|0:32:37|The rhythmic guitar sound plays, [Yang Fangfang] smiles as she looks at [Guo Yang] on the stage.
0:33:0|0:33:6|On the stage, [Guo Yang] shone brightly under the spotlight, while [Yang Fangfang] sat below, mesmerized by the profile of [Guo Yang].
0:33:54|0:34:0|Yang Fangfang in the audience had a smile on her face, perhaps she had already found that extraordinary lover.
0:34:13|0:34:45|[Guo Yang] held a wine glass in one hand, grabbed [Yang Fangfang]'s glass in the other hand, then tilted his head back and poured all the wine into his mouth. His friends around him teased him. After the party, [Guo Yang] and [Yang Fangfang] took a walk together. As the alcohol started to take effect, [Guo Yang]'s body began to sway from side to side. [Yang Fangfang] sneakily glanced at him and couldn't help but burst into laughter. At this moment, [Guo Yang] looked dazed and started to stagger as he walked.
0:34:48|0:35:11|[Guo Yang] sat down on the steps, supporting himself with his hands behind him. He then looked up at [Yang Fangfang], gesturing for her to sit next to him. After [Yang Fangfang] sat down, she tightly held onto her skirt, keeping her head down and avoiding eye contact with [Guo Yang]. [Guo Yang], on the other hand, kept staring at [Yang Fangfang], perhaps sensing her intense gaze. In a moment when [Yang Fangfang] lifted her head, she caught a glimpse of his eyes that he couldn't dodge in time.
0:35:12|0:35:28|Guo Yang turned his head and saw Yang Fangfang smiling at him. She then shyly buried her face down. Guo Yang's eyes were fixed on Yang Fangfang, his hands on his lap fidgeting back and forth. He moved his lips as if wanting to speak, but felt like something was blocking his throat.
0:35:28|0:35:36|The night was so quiet that one could hear their own nervous breathing. Finally, he mustered up the courage to say to [Yang Fangfang],
0:35:41|0:35:54|Upon hearing these words, [Yang Fangfang] became even more shy, her smile on her face unable to hide. Without a clear rejection from [Yang Fangfang], [Guo Yang] felt relieved. He let out a long sigh and then placed his hands back behind him.
0:35:54|0:36:1|Next, he moved closer to [Yang Fangfang], who kept her head down and didn't move. [Guo Yang] took the initiative to lower his head and said,
0:36:12|0:36:32|[Yang Fangfang] smiled and replied, but [Guo Yang] couldn't resist anymore as he embraced [Yang Fangfang] and kissed her. The sudden kiss was like a storm catching [Yang Fangfang] off guard, leaving her with wide eyes and a blank mind as she looked at the face so close to hers, smelled his faint scent, and felt his breath.
0:36:32|0:36:42|[Yang Fangfang] felt a sense of dream come true, not sure if it was because she was too nervous or [Guo Yang]'s kiss was too tight, she felt like she couldn't breathe.
0:36:42|0:37:2|Sensing something unusual from [Yang Fangfang], [Guo Yang] stopped and asked. [Yang Fangfang] blushed and stared at the person in front of her, but when she saw his flustered expression, she smiled again, her eyes narrowing into slits. Then she shyly lowered her head. [Guo Yang] looked at her happily and also started to smile.
0:37:2|0:37:11|In the early morning, Zhenyuan seemed to be covered in a layer of fine sand. The two held hands and came to the lakeside.
0:37:37|0:37:43|The emerald green lake came to a stop with a small boat, [Guo Yang] raised his hand on one side, signaling [Yang Fangfang] to grab onto him.
0:38:10|0:38:23|[Yang Fangfang] sat on the boat, hands holding onto the sides, while [Guo Yang] skillfully rowed at the bow. The tranquil atmosphere created a sense of contentment for [Yang Fangfang].
0:38:31|0:38:43|In the early morning, the two of them held hands and came to the top of the mountain to overlook the scenery of Zhenyuan. The gentle sunlight shone on [Guo Yang]'s face, and [Yang Fangfang] looked up at his sharply defined profile. She couldn't help but tiptoe and gently kissed his cheek.
0:39:11|0:39:18|She wished so much that time could stop, holding hands with [Guo Yang] becoming tighter and tighter.
0:40:4|0:40:9|[Yang Fangfang] reproachfully said a sentence to Wu Xiaoyu, then uncomfortably scratched her face with her hand.
0:40:59|0:41:8|Wu Xiaoyu finished speaking with a meaningful look at the two people opposite. [Yang Fangfang] rested her chin on her hand, pretending not to understand. After the dinner, the two of them went to the street to play a game of whack-a-mole.
0:41:11|0:41:25|The sky darkens, with a few lights flickering on the square. [Guo Yang] carries [Yang Fangfang] on his back, running and cheering on the square. Passersby look on curiously as the joyful time flies by. [Yang Fangfang] walks to the bus stop sign, while [Guo Yang] slowly follows behind with something in his hands.
0:41:38|0:41:46|[Yang Fangfang] finished speaking and shyly lowered her head. Seeing this, [Guo Yang] didn't say anything more. The two of them then stood in place and started playing the game of "You Draw, I Guess".
0:42:7|0:42:15|[Yang Fangfang] lowered her head and pondered for a moment after hearing it, then turned around and smiled at [Guo Yang], saying,
0:43:9|0:43:30|[Guo Yang] didn't answer, one hand holding [Yang Fangfang], the other hand picking up the luggage placed on the side. The light in the hotel corridor revealed a hint of ambiguity, [Guo Yang] led [Yang Fangfang] towards the room, when a couple came towards them, [Yang Fangfang] awkwardly turned her head away.
0:43:30|0:43:37|Strange sounds could be heard from the corridor from time to time, gradually causing disgust in [Yang Fangfang]. Looking at the unfamiliar surroundings, her face turned very unpleasant.
0:43:37|0:44:5|At this moment, [Guo Yang] was looking up intently searching for the room, while [Yang Fangfang] was walking faster in the opposite direction. [Guo Yang] quickly caught up and they walked side by side without saying a word. Suddenly, [Guo Yang] stopped, turned around, and looked at [Yang Fangfang], whispering,
0:44:9|0:44:15|Looking at the sincere eyes of [Guo Yang], her heart began to waver, and the thought of leaving ruthlessly drifted away one by one.
0:44:15|0:44:30|The two then entered the room, the sound of running water coming from the bathroom. [Guo Yang] sat on the bed watching TV, irritably pressing the remote control in his hand. His eyes involuntarily glanced towards the bathroom, then he turned his head, trying hard to control his actions.
0:44:30|0:44:48|The bathroom door suddenly opened, startling [Guo Yang]. After a quick glance, he immediately turned his head towards the TV. [Yang Fangfang] spoke to him. [Guo Yang] pretended to be calm and responded, then walked towards the bathroom.
0:44:48|0:44:59|Yang Fangfang on the side looked at his embarrassed expression, chuckled secretly, suddenly the footsteps behind stopped, Yang Fangfang turned around and found Guo Yang carefully holding his change of clothes.
0:44:59|0:45:19|To avoid embarrassment, [Yang Fangfang] quickly averted her gaze, while [Guo Yang] swiftly grabbed his clothes and headed towards the bathroom. That night, they each slept on a separate bed, but [Guo Yang] couldn't calm his inner turmoil. He kept staring at [Yang Fangfang]'s back, wanting to say something but hesitating. After much internal struggle, he finally lifted his head and asked,
0:45:24|0:45:50|[Yang Fangfang] was not actually asleep. She responded softly, and then [Guo Yang] lifted the covers and sat up in bed. Suddenly, [Yang Fangfang] felt someone gently pulling down the collar of her back. She immediately closed her eyes, feeling the warm breath on the back of her neck. Every nerve in [Yang Fangfang]'s body seemed to be electrified as the two bodies pressed closer on the narrow single bed. [Guo Yang] could not hide the heat in his heart as he gently kissed [Yang Fangfang]'s neck.
0:45:50|0:46:7|The following kiss became more intense, with [Yang Fangfang] tightly furrowing her brows without moving. Then, [Guo Yang] propped up his upper body with one arm, and each kiss fell on [Yang Fangfang]'s shoulders and arms. [Guo Yang]'s breathing also became increasingly heavy.
0:46:13|0:46:28|When emotions ran deep, [Guo Yang]'s hands moved uncontrollably, causing [Yang Fangfang] to sit up in fear. She lowered her head, unable to face him, and involuntarily shifted her body away. With a hint of apology, [Guo Yang] spoke.
0:46:28|0:46:41|The two of them lay on the bed again, but a bit further apart. [Yang Fangfang] looked at the guilty [Guo Yang] without saying anything more. After a while, she slowly closed her eyes. Although [Guo Yang] promised not to make any moves, his inner desire did not diminish at all.
0:46:45|0:46:58|He couldn't help but lean over and gently kiss Yang Fangfang's forehead, then retreated to a safe distance. Guo Yang quietly looked at the cute and lovely face in front of him, feeling helpless and frustrated by this unattainable feeling.
0:46:58|0:47:7|At this moment, the faint scent on [Yang Fangfang]'s body also lingered in his nostrils from time to time, as if the desire that had just subsided in his body was reignited.
0:47:7|0:47:29|After a while, [Guo Yang] could no longer bear the restlessness in his body. He pushed aside the blanket and dove into his own quilt as if escaping. He turned his back and dared not look at [Yang Fangfang], while his other hand tightly gripped the corner of the blanket. For anyone involved, this was destined to be a difficult night.
0:47:29|0:47:52|The next morning, [Yang Fangfang] groggily opened her eyes. With a hint of morning grumpiness, she let out a soft hum and then turned her head to see if [Guo Yang] had woken up. However, the bed opposite hers was empty, and the room was quiet. She immediately got up from bed and peeked towards the bathroom, nervously calling out,
0:47:52|0:48:7|The room was empty and silent, [Yang Fangfang] suddenly felt afraid, her heart beating rapidly. She quickly got out of bed and opened the curtains. Just as she was looking out the window for [Guo Yang], a knocking sound suddenly came from behind her.
0:48:17|0:48:47|Outside the door was the voice of [Guo Yang]. [Yang Fangfang] felt relieved and immediately ran to open the door. After closing the door, [Yang Fangfang] obediently followed behind [Guo Yang], finding it a bit funny how flustered she had been earlier. The two of them then sat down on chairs to enjoy breakfast.
0:48:52|0:49:10|Upon hearing [Guo Yang]'s words, [Yang Fangfang] shyly lowered her head, stirring her breakfast with chopsticks. The two then held hands and visited the scenic spot together, with [Guo Yang] standing in front of a locked gate while [Yang Fangfang] stood beside him with her eyes closed.
0:50:5|0:50:20|[Guo Yang]'s words made [Yang Fangfang] feel cared for. She hugged [Guo Yang] and rested her head on his shoulder, saying she wouldn't miss him is a lie.
0:51:54|0:52:15|Latecomer [Yang Fangfang] quickly found a seat, opened her notebook, but then her daughter and boyfriend's photo appeared on the foreign language teacher's PPT. Classmates started to make a commotion. [Yang Fangfang] looked at the photo and began to ponder.
0:52:52|0:53:8|[Yang Fangfang] pressed the end call button heavily, the anger in her heart rising rapidly. The impatient tone of [Guo Yang] on the phone kept echoing in her ears. She walked dejectedly towards the dormitory, then suddenly stopped as if she remembered something. Soon after, a smile reappeared on her face.
0:53:13|0:53:22|[Yang Fangfang] paid no attention to her roommate's surprise, and her actions of packing her luggage became faster and faster. At this moment, she wished she could fly back to Kaili directly to meet her beloved.
0:53:22|0:53:52|On the train to Kaili, [Yang Fangfang] sat by the window, admiring the scenery outside. A happy smile appeared on her face from time to time as familiar buildings gradually came into view. Unable to contain her excitement, [Yang Fangfang] stood up. Several hours later, she arrived at [Guo Yang]'s school, pulling her luggage.
0:53:56|0:54:3|Yang Fangfang then walked towards the direction pointed by the boy. The thought of soon seeing Guo Yang made Yang Fangfang's steps quicken.
0:54:3|0:54:17|At the bottom of the dormitory building, [Yang Fangfang] picked up her phone and called [Guo Yang]. She eagerly told [Guo Yang] about her arrival and then sat on the steps waiting for him.
0:54:17|0:54:37|On a chilly night, [Yang Fangfang] tightly hugged her arms and looked at the path ahead. The people passing by the dormitory were scattered, but she never saw a familiar face. She stood up, rubbed her cold hands, and turned around to see her shadow on the wall. She gestured with her fingers to resemble a small dog and played with it absentmindedly.
0:54:37|0:54:42|Suddenly, another little dog appeared on the wall,
0:55:30|0:55:45|Yang Fangfang and Guo Yang returned to the hotel again. At this moment, Yang Fangfang, who had just finished showering, was blow-drying her hair with a hairdryer, while Guo Yang walked out of the bathroom after finishing his grooming.
0:55:48|0:56:2|[Guo Yang] took the hairdryer from [Yang Fangfang]'s hand, pressed the button somewhat clumsily. [Yang Fangfang] shyly lowered her head as he played with her hair. After finishing one side, [Guo Yang] turned to the other side. [Yang Fangfang] felt his care and protection from the bottom of her heart.
0:56:2|0:56:10|The corners of her mouth curved into a happy smile. She then looked up at [Guo Yang]'s face, who was earnestly taking care of her hair.
0:56:11|0:56:21|[Yang Fangfang] knew she was already immersed in [Guo Yang]'s thoughtfulness. She raised her hands and tightly embraced this warmth that belonged to her, feeling [Yang Fangfang]'s response. [Guo Yang] smiled even more happily.
0:56:23|0:56:47|In the embrace, [Guo Yang] passionately expresses his longing, pausing the hairdryer in his hand to gently stroke her hair. Then, he pinches her cheek and as [Yang Fangfang] slowly lifts her head, [Guo Yang] gently supports the back of her head and leans down. [Yang Fangfang] closes her eyes slowly, and [Guo Yang]'s kisses land on her forehead, nose, and finally on her lips.
0:56:47|0:57:5|[Yang Fangfang] opened her eyes and looked at the man who fascinated her, closing her eyes contentedly to savor the moment. At this point, [Guo Yang]'s kiss became more intense, and [Yang Fangfang] was already immersed in this wonderful sensation, unable to extricate herself. She eagerly tilted her head back, longing for the meeting of their tongues.
0:57:5|0:57:21|At this moment, [Guo Yang] pressed his body down, overpowering [Yang Fangfang] on the bed. [Yang Fangfang] opened her eyes and met his confused and infatuated gaze. The strong scent of hormones began to fill the room, followed by [Guo Yang]'s kiss attacking once again, leaving no chance to catch a breath.
0:57:21|0:57:43|[Yang Fangfang] once again lost consciousness in the wild invasion, unknowingly the clothes on both of them had already been stripped off. [Guo Yang] looked at [Yang Fangfang] beneath him with love in his eyes. At this moment, [Yang Fangfang]'s hand rested on [Guo Yang]'s shoulder, then she slowly closed her eyes. [Guo Yang]'s kiss started to become gentle, as he slowly moved his body to occupy this tenderness.
0:57:43|0:57:58|[Yang Fangfang]'s tense body is gradually relaxing at this moment. She is starting to get used to [Guo Yang]'s gentle yet intense advances. Instead of feeling the pain on her body, she feels that this is a sincere mutual surrender.
0:57:59|0:58:24|In the classroom, the melodious sound of the piano can be heard. [Guo Yang] is sitting in front of the piano, his well-defined fingers skillfully moving on the black and white keys. He then turns his head to look at [Yang Fangfang] sitting beside him. [Yang Fangfang] immediately understands and smiles sweetly. She slowly raises her hand, and her small fingers play crisp chords. [Guo Yang] follows the rhythm and starts playing along.
0:58:24|0:58:30|The beautiful sound of the piano echoed in the classroom. The affection in their eyes deepened even more.
0:58:31|0:58:37|The harmonious duet once again brought them closer, the silhouette of the two of them leaning tightly against each other looked so sweet.
0:58:37|0:58:58|After a night of passionate revelry, [Yang Fangfang] lay beside [Guo Yang], gently caressing his forehead and nose with her fingers. The love in her eyes deepened as her fingers eventually landed on [Guo Yang]'s lips, repeatedly caressing them. Suddenly, as if waking up from a pretend sleep, [Guo Yang] opened his eyes and swiftly grabbed [Yang Fangfang]'s hand, rolling over on top of her.
0:58:59|0:59:20|The next day, [Guo Yang] took [Yang Fangfang] to the cinema. Watching the poignant love story in the film, [Yang Fangfang] was moved to tears. Suddenly, [Guo Yang] leaned on her shoulder, and [Yang Fangfang] looked down at his sleeping face and smiled. Then she looked up again to appreciate the precious love story in front of her. In the evening, the two of them played a game of "You Draw, I Guess".
0:59:21|0:59:31|[Yang Fangfang] knew [Guo Yang]'s thoughts and gave him a disapproving look, saying,
0:59:48|1:0:3|[Yang Fangfang] lied to her mother, while [Guo Yang] sat beside her, laughing and joking. She quickly put her finger in front of her mouth to signal [Guo Yang] to be quiet. The young love dared not easily let family members know, and [Yang Fangfang] gave this impulsive courage for love to her only first love.
1:0:3|1:0:16|Days passed by, every minute and every second spent with [Guo Yang] by her side brought joy to [Yang Fangfang]. The next day, the two of them arrived at the lakeside, with [Guo Yang] riding a bicycle and [Yang Fangfang] sitting on the back, holding onto him.
1:1:2|1:1:12|[Yang Fangfang] said nothing, just shook her head silently. [Guo Yang] pedaled the bicycle again, but this time [Yang Fangfang] did not put her hands on his waist, instead she gripped the bottom of the seat.
1:1:22|1:1:28|At noon that day, the two of them came to the school cafeteria to eat. [Yang Fangfang] put all the meat from the dishes into [Guo Yang]'s bowl.
1:2:8|1:2:19|[Guo Yang] hurriedly caught up, [Yang Fangfang] wiped away a tear and turned around to speak.
1:2:31|1:2:41|[Yang Fangfang] shook off [Guo Yang]'s hand while speaking, leaving [Guo Yang] feeling confused and at a loss on how to salvage the situation. As he watched [Yang Fangfang] walk away resolutely, he couldn't help but start sobbing.
1:2:41|1:3:5|At this moment, [Yang Fangfang] turned around and stood in silence, clearly upset and ignoring [Guo Yang] behind her. When [Yang Fangfang] heard him crying like a child, her heart ached as well. Reflecting on the hurtful words she said in anger, [Yang Fangfang] realized she had gone too far. She slowly approached and embraced [Guo Yang] once again.
1:3:5|1:3:10|The beautiful love story encounters its first setback, maybe they should give each other some time.
1:3:14|1:3:21|[Yang Fangfang] stood at the stairs of the waiting hall and looked back. Down below, [Guo Yang] was making faces at her, but she still couldn't bring herself to smile.
1:3:22|1:3:36|Shortly after, she turned around to continue carrying her luggage up the stairs. After a few steps, she turned back again, only to see [Guo Yang] still standing motionless in place, watching her leave. Seeing [Guo Yang]'s smile, [Yang Fangfang] couldn't help but smile along.
1:3:36|1:3:52|Farewell is to meet again better, [Yang Fangfang] silently persuaded herself in her heart. She picked up her luggage and walked up the stairs again, this time without looking back, she dared not look back. Shortly after, she sat on the bus back to school, with no expression on her face.
1:4:56|1:5:6|The mysterious person that Wu Xiaoyu mentioned is the man who struck up a conversation with [Yang Fangfang] on the train in Guangzhou. [Yang Fangfang] was focused on eating and didn't want to say much more, so the unpleasant meal ended like that.
1:5:6|1:5:27|That day, [Yang Fangfang] left the evening self-study and walked towards the dormitory. Everywhere on the road leading to the dormitory were hugging couples. [Yang Fangfang] stood in place watching others cuddle, thinking once again of the time spent with [Guo Yang]. Then she slowly moved her feet forward, but her eyes never left the couples stuck together.
1:5:27|1:5:42|In her eyes, there was envy mixed with a hint of jealousy. Then she quickly ran towards the dormitory with her head down. Upon returning to the dorm, [Yang Fangfang] started packing her luggage. Her roommate, who came back after washing up, saw her and asked,
1:5:53|1:6:11|[Yang Fangfang] caught the last train back to Kaili. Standing in the corridor, she waved away the smell of smoke with her hand. Overcome by drowsiness, she could only crouch in the corner of the aisle, resting her head on her elbow. When she arrived at the dormitory building, she called [Guo Yang].
1:6:34|1:6:46|Upon seeing [Yang Fangfang] appear with a suitcase, the smile on [Guo Yang]'s face abruptly disappeared. [Yang Fangfang] stared at [Guo Yang] with red eyes for a long time, then she turned and walked away, with [Guo Yang] following after her.
1:6:48|1:7:13|No matter how much [Guo Yang] shouted, [Yang Fangfang] still didn't stop and walked straight towards the teaching building. A timely apology temporarily calmed the anger in [Yang Fangfang]'s heart. She looked up at the aggrieved [Guo Yang] in front of her, and unknowingly, her heart softened again. Then the two of them returned to the hotel to rest.
1:7:13|1:7:31|In the room, [Yang Fangfang] lay on the bed sulking, while [Guo Yang] sat on the other side of the bed watching a game. She forcefully pulled back the covers, making an angry noise, but he didn't pay any attention. [Yang Fangfang] stood up and deliberately walked past him, but [Guo Yang] turned his head away, still watching the TV without looking at her once.
1:8:42|1:8:59|The busy voice of [Guo Yang] on the phone echoed in her ears, [Yang Fangfang] looked at the disconnected interface with a mix of anger and helplessness. Sitting in the library, [Yang Fangfang] felt restless and had no intention to study. She glanced out the window and at the students studying around her, the quiet atmosphere only added to her sense of inner oppression.
1:8:59|1:9:12|She reached out and picked up the phone at the corner of the table, but saw no messages. Faced with [Guo Yang]'s indifference, [Yang Fangfang] could no longer bear it. She slammed the pen on the table and walked out with the phone in hand. As she walked, she dialed [Guo Yang]'s number.
1:9:17|1:9:39|Yang Fangfang, who hung up the phone, couldn't calm down for a long time. Guo Yang's neglect and indifference towards her were not once or twice. The more she thought about it, the angrier she became, her chest heaving up and down uncontrollably. As the winter vacation arrived, Yang Fangfang and Wu Xiaoyu sat on the train heading home.
1:9:39|1:9:47|[Yang Fangfang] couldn't believe her ears. She turned to look at Wu Xiaoyu and asked,
1:10:32|1:10:39|[Yang Fangfang] turned her head and said nothing more. The way Wu Xiaoyu let go so freely was probably something she could never achieve.
1:10:41|1:11:4|The phone rang again, and [Yang Fangfang] immediately jumped out of bed to grab the phone. Looking at the call from [Guo Yang], her originally excited heart was filled with an unnamed anger. She pushed the chair away and sat at the desk, glancing at the phone screen before putting it down. The phone kept ringing, and [Yang Fangfang]'s conflicted heart gradually became restless.
1:11:29|1:11:54|[Yang Fangfang] slammed down her chopsticks, picked up the nearby phone and returned to her room. Her brother brought his girlfriend home for dinner, a feeling of being ignored by her family completely infuriated [Yang Fangfang]. She held the phone in her hand, waiting for [Guo Yang] to call again. Before long, her brother pushed the door open and entered. [Yang Fangfang] glanced at the door without saying anything.
1:12:11|1:12:21|After her brother left the bedroom, [Yang Fangfang] let out a deep sigh, resting her head on her hand on the desk. Her mind was in turmoil, with no room to think about anything else.
1:12:23|1:12:41|The phone rang again, and [Yang Fangfang] pressed the answer button. After resolving the conflict, the next day [Yang Fangfang] immediately came to the school to look for [Guo Yang]. The door of the hotel room opened, [Yang Fangfang] smiled at [Guo Yang] outside the door, and the two who hadn't seen each other for a long time embraced tightly.
1:12:42|1:12:53|Guo Yang let go of his arm and looked at Yang Fangfang in his arms, asking. Emotions came and went quickly.
1:12:53|1:13:17|The previous conflicts and issues were all thrown aside by the two, [Guo Yang]'s kiss gradually broke down [Yang Fangfang]'s defenses, the long-missed affection burst forth at this moment, the two of them passionately kissing without a care in the world, [Yang Fangfang] closed her eyes and savored [Guo Yang]'s longing for her, then a gentle kiss landed on her forehead, a smile unconsciously appeared on her lips, [Yang Fangfang] felt at this moment that she was the happiest person in the world.
1:13:17|1:13:39|[Guo Yang] smiled as he carried her towards the bed, and [Yang Fangfang] understood her intentions. She shyly lowered her head, then fell onto the soft mattress, feeling the weight that followed completely conquer her. In the bathroom, [Yang Fangfang] was taking a shower when [Guo Yang] quietly pushed the door open and peeked in halfway.
1:13:44|1:14:1|[Yang Fangfang] smiled and pushed [Guo Yang], who was deliberately pouting, out of the door. Turning around, she couldn't help but secretly laugh as she remembered the pitiful look in [Guo Yang]'s eyes. After a while, [Yang Fangfang] walked out of the bathroom with a smile on her face. She saw [Guo Yang] sitting neatly on the edge of the bed, looking puzzled.
1:14:15|1:14:23|[Yang Fangfang] raised her head and looked at [Guo Yang]'s expectant eyes, then slowly lowered her head and said,
1:14:33|1:14:54|[Yang Fangfang] watched as the excited [Guo Yang] hesitated to speak, but he just walked away without looking back. She could only stand in place, staring at his departing figure. As she watched the closed door, her heart was filled with loneliness. Looking at the room that had just been filled with tenderness, her heart felt as cold as an ice cellar. Clearly, she didn't want him to leave, so why couldn't he see through her sadness?
1:14:54|1:15:13|As the time grew later, [Yang Fangfang] picked up her phone and dialed [Guo Yang]'s number, but it was unreachable. Growing even angrier, she threw her phone aside and started getting dressed. Since the other party seemed completely indifferent, she saw no reason to stay any longer.
1:15:20|1:15:38|[Yang Fangfang]'s hand hesitated in the air as she opened the door, afraid that she might miss something if she left now. Perhaps [Guo Yang] was on his way back at this moment. She returned to the sofa and sat down again, waiting slowly for the grievances and fears in her heart to turn into tears.
1:15:38|1:15:45|[Yang Fangfang] doesn't understand the meaning of her long journey here.
1:15:48|1:16:6|In the morning, [Yang Fangfang] was awakened by the knocking on the door. Hearing [Guo Yang]'s voice outside, she eagerly got up to open the door. When she realized that [Guo Yang] had not returned all night, she angrily threw off the covers, grabbed her backpack, and walked out with her packed suitcase.
1:16:11|1:16:18|[Guo Yang] impatiently asked when he saw the luggage in [Yang Fangfang]'s hands.
1:16:24|1:16:41|[Guo Yang] watched as [Yang Fangfang] stormed out of the door, feeling a sense of agitation rising within him. As he watched her disappearing down the corridor, [Guo Yang] felt a surge of anger building up inside him. Leaning against the door, he remained motionless, with no hint of nostalgia in his eyes. [Guo Yang] felt that in this relationship, he had had enough of [Yang Fangfang]'s antics.
1:16:43|1:16:49|At this moment, [Yang Fangfang] was running forward quickly with a suitcase in hand, panting heavily but never stopping.
1:16:49|1:17:14|From coming out of the room until now, she hasn't heard any retention from [Guo Yang]. Slowly, she stopped and looked back, but there was no familiar figure behind her. Looking at the vast square, the grievance surged in [Yang Fangfang]'s heart. [Guo Yang]'s heartlessness deeply pierced her heart. Back home, [Yang Fangfang] lay on the bed listlessly.
1:17:14|1:17:28|Thinking of her helplessness in the square, tears flowed uncontrollably. Remembering the happy moments with [Guo Yang], her heart ached as if being cut by a knife. She tightly clutched a corner of the pillow, trying hard not to cry out loud.
1:17:28|1:17:44|Since the day he came back until now, [Guo Yang] has never contacted her. It was she who initiated the breakup, and it seems like she's the only one feeling sad. It's not a solution to be sad alone like this. Holding back her tears, [Yang Fangfang] decides to go to the school to look for [Guo Yang].
1:17:44|1:17:54|She immediately lifted the blanket and got out of bed, picked up the clothes hanging on the wall and ran out. [Yang Fangfang] came to [Guo Yang]'s school without hesitation, and she began to search for [Guo Yang]'s figure everywhere.
1:17:54|1:18:14|Once again, standing by the lake where they used to ride bicycles together, looking around, with only a few pedestrians passing by, [Yang Fangfang] stood on the bridge, afraid of missing any corner. She anxiously looked around, feeling like ants on a hot pan, hoping to see [Guo Yang] and longing for reconciliation, memories of the past flooding back.
1:18:14|1:18:20|[Yang Fangfang] was determined to find [Guo Yang], but she searched for him all day without success.
1:18:20|1:18:39|At night, [Yang Fangfang] came to the bottom of the boys' dormitory, silently waiting for the appearance of [Guo Yang]. Her eyes, swollen from crying, stared at the door, and the cold autumn wind blew through. [Yang Fangfang] was already numb from the cold. Just as she was thinking about how to speak to [Guo Yang], a figure appeared at the door, the person she had been longing for was right in front of her.
1:18:39|1:18:52|[Yang Fangfang] instantly smiled when she saw [Guo Yang] coming out of the building, but he didn't even notice her. She was about to greet him when she was heartbroken by what happened next - [Guo Yang] walked straight to another girl.
1:18:52|1:19:10|[Yang Fangfang]'s smile suddenly disappeared, the name she was about to shout out also swallowed back into her mouth, watching their figures getting farther and farther away until they disappeared. It was only then that [Yang Fangfang] slowly recovered from the sadness. She still couldn't believe it as she watched in the direction where [Guo Yang] and the unfamiliar girl had disappeared, her eyes starting to turn red.
1:19:10|1:19:32|After leaving school, [Yang Fangfang] walked aimlessly on the street, tears streaming down her face. Passersby looked at her as she wiped her tears away, the bustling street filled with people. The streetlights seemed to illuminate every corner of the city.
1:19:32|1:19:49|[Yang Fangfang] walked alone on the street, recalling the moments with [Guo Yang], and then thinking about the scenes she saw today, [Yang Fangfang] felt even more suffocated in her heart. It turned out that in [Guo Yang]'s eyes, she could be replaced by someone else at any time. Thinking about this, tears uncontrollably welled up in her eyes.
1:19:53|1:20:11|Alone on the street, [Yang Fangfang] squatted down and cried, attracting the attention of passersby. On the bus ride home, [Yang Fangfang] had stopped crying, with red eyes she sat there blankly, lost in thought. No one knew what she had been through, and no one knew what was on her mind.
1:20:11|1:20:25|The bus moved forward slowly, and [Yang Fangfang]'s heart also gradually calmed down. She pursed her lips silently digesting the pain of heartbreak, tears slowly welling up in her eyes. She immediately lifted her head, stubbornly preventing the tears from flowing.
1:21:25|1:21:37|[Yang Fangfang] came to Wu Xiaoyu's house, the two of them picked up the red wine glasses on the table and drank them up, then she leaned on the balcony looking into the distance, while Wu Xiaoyu behind her was coaxing the child.
1:21:57|1:22:7|Wu Xiaoyu's question is exactly the same as the question in [Yang Fangfang]'s heart. She doesn't know if she should go see this man who once caused her pain, and what kind of scene it would be if she saw him again.
1:22:7|1:22:28|At this moment, [Yang Fangfang] has already boarded the taxi heading to the agreed meeting point. The tunnel lights are reflecting on her face. The [Yang Fangfang] who used to run for love with long hair now looks like a grown-up, with neat short hair, a calm expression, and a cool gaze looking straight ahead. She is about to go meet that man.
1:22:28|1:22:34|She walked on the street, looking at the shops with lights on the roadside, with a hint of joy in her eyes.
1:22:34|1:22:58|[Yang Fangfang] walked in the alley wearing a pink suit and a floral dress, the clacking sound of her high heels accompanying her steps. She looked around searching for that coffee shop, and as she turned around, she saw the familiar profile in the glass window. In that instant, the same smile that appeared on [Yang Fangfang]'s face when she saw [Guo Yang] before reappeared. Realizing she had lost control, she immediately suppressed the smile.
1:22:58|1:23:14|She understood that this meeting didn't mean much, he was no longer the original [Guo Yang], and she was no longer the original [Yang Fangfang]. Thinking of this, she smiled bitterly to herself, then composed herself and walked towards the coffee shop. At that moment, [Guo Yang] was still casually flipping through books in the coffee shop.
1:23:14|1:23:21|This meeting also made him feel a little nervous, the impetuosity of his youth putting an end to this immature love.
1:23:21|1:23:40|This time's proactive invitation may be seen as making up for past mistakes. As [Yang Fangfang] walked into the store, her heart couldn't help but beat faster. At this moment, she was one step closer to [Guo Yang], and his profile became clearer. [Guo Yang]'s thick eyebrows and high nose bridge remained unchanged from before, except for a new sense of maturity and steadiness.
1:23:40|1:23:47|She walked slowly towards the dining table, smiling and greeted [Guo Yang] proactively. The seated [Guo Yang] immediately stood up and responded with a smile.
1:24:0|1:24:12|No one wants to dwell on the right or wrong of the past, just cherish the present time. When we were young, we didn't know how to love, we just stuck to each other tightly. We also didn't know how to protect love when we were young.
1:24:24|1:24:31|[Yang Fangfang] walked out of the coffee shop, looking at the street singer, recalling the day she broke up with [Guo Yang], she also let go in her heart.
