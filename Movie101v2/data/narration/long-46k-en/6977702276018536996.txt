0:3:46|0:4:6|As the breakup farce between [Meng Yun] and his girlfriend [Lin Jia] unfolds, the title of the movie appears. Listening to [Meng Yun] pouring his heart out, Yu Fei calmly bites into a skewer, chewing on grilled meat absentmindedly while nodding along.
0:4:8|0:4:14|[Meng Yun] paused with the wine glass in hand, furrowing his brows, and after a moment of contemplation, [Lin Jia] turned to her best friend and said,
0:5:0|0:5:29|The scene cuts to [Meng Yun]'s home, where he sits on the sofa absentmindedly playing with a lighter. He occasionally glances sneakily towards the bedroom, while [Lin Jia] sits angrily on the bed looking towards the door. [Meng Yun] lights a cigarette and watches TV, both of them refusing to speak. Frustrated, [Lin Jia] gets up from the bed. [Meng Yun] stealthily walks to the bedroom door to eavesdrop, but the door suddenly opens. He quickly turns back to the sofa, picks up the cigarette, pretending as if nothing happened.
0:5:30|0:5:36|[Lin Jia] walked out and crossed the corridor, heading straight to another room, ignoring [Meng Yun].
0:5:36|0:5:49|[Meng Yun] pretended to watch TV while smoking, but couldn't help turning his head to sneak a peek when he heard a noise. He saw [Lin Jia] coming out with a suitcase. Immediately, [Meng Yun] turned back to the TV, while [Lin Jia] walked back to the bedroom with the suitcase without looking back.
0:5:49|0:6:12|[Meng Yun] looked at her back with an incredulous expression, [Lin Jia] closed the bedroom door and stood at the doorway sighing, then sat on the bed sulking, her face full of grievances. She glanced outside the door, at this moment [Meng Yun] sneaked back to the bedroom door again, hearing the sound of the door opening, [Meng Yun] panicked and quickly sat at the TV cabinet pretending to search for something.
0:6:13|0:6:19|[Lin Jia] walked past and was startled by [Meng Yun] sitting on the ground. She then flipped her hair and pretended to walk away calmly.
0:6:20|0:6:34|[Meng Yun] sneaked a peek while continuing to search through things, as [Lin Jia] dragged another suitcase from another room back to the bedroom. [Meng Yun] peeked towards the bedroom again, only to be met with the heavy sound of the door closing once more.
0:6:34|0:6:59|[Lin Jia] is in the room, [Meng Yun] is lying on the floor. At this moment, the door opens again, and [Meng Yun] pretends to go to the kitchen. He pretends to pour water with his back to [Lin Jia]. [Lin Jia] walks out and habitually looks towards the living room. It's only when she hears some noise that she notices [Meng Yun] in the kitchen. [Lin Jia] walks straight to the small bedroom. [Meng Yun] drinks water while looking back to check the situation. [Lin Jia] comes out again pulling the suitcase, pretending to walk towards the living room as if she doesn't care.
0:6:59|0:7:23|[Lin Jia] dragged the suitcase back to the bedroom and forcefully closed the door. [Meng Yun] sat on the sofa, helplessly biting his lip. In the bedroom, [Lin Jia] sat on the bed, staring blankly at the three empty suitcases on the floor. [Meng Yun] placed the water glass on the coffee table, hurriedly got up clutching his stomach, and even remembered to light a cigarette before leaving. Afterwards, as he habitually turned to the drawer, he found the paper tube empty.
0:7:24|0:7:34|He reached out to the drawer next to him with great effort, but found not a scrap of paper when he opened it. Helpless, he picked up the trash can next to him, but the smell overwhelmed him and he had to give up.
0:7:35|0:7:55|[Meng Yun] frowned and stared at the tiny scrap of paper in his hand, shaking his head. He picked up the cigarette in his hand and placed it near his mouth. Suddenly, a light bulb went off in his head as he thought of an idea involving the cigarette. After some contemplation, he realized it wouldn't work, so he reluctantly and angrily threw the cigarette to the ground. Finally, he made up his mind and reached behind him with the remaining scrap of paper.
0:7:55|0:8:8|After a while, [Meng Yun] stood solemnly by the sink, frantically washing his hands with soap. The camera then cut to him sitting on the sofa, meticulously cleaning his nails, occasionally sniffing his hands to check for any odor.
0:8:8|0:8:16|The bedroom door suddenly opened, and [Lin Jia] walked out, took a roll of toilet paper from the cabinet, glanced at [Meng Yun], and left without saying a word.
0:8:16|0:8:35|Seeing the indifferent [Lin Jia], [Meng Yun] showed an expression of unbearable frustration, went back to the bedroom. [Lin Jia] sat on the floor sorting out clothes, she never got the reconciliation from [Meng Yun]. The endless cold war between them had made [Meng Yun] powerless to resist. He no longer paid attention to [Lin Jia]'s actions, and started lying on the sofa drinking beer.
0:8:35|0:8:44|It's late at night, both of them have settled down. [Meng Yun] is lying on the sofa, holding a cushion in his hands. He is watching TV expressionlessly, lost in his thoughts.
0:8:44|0:8:58|[Lin Jia] lay on the bed in the bedroom, constantly playing with the wind chimes hanging on the wall with her fingers. She stared at him intently, the dim light at the head of the bed shining on her face. Slowly, she put her hand down, her face filled with sorrow.
0:8:58|0:9:18|She turned to look at the dolphin plush toy on the bed, perhaps out of loneliness, she held the toy tightly in her arms. In the living room, Meng Yun lay on the sofa, covered with a blanket, his gaze blankly staring ahead. Tonight made him feel exhausted, and in the living room, his figure appeared particularly lonely.
0:9:18|0:9:32|After a night passed, the next morning, Meng Yun lay on the sofa, watching the finals on TV with her eyes open. At this moment, Lin Jia came out of the bedroom pushing two suitcases and said,
0:9:39|0:9:43|[Meng Yun] ignored the last step offered by [Lin Jia], who turned her head in disappointment.
0:9:54|0:10:11|Watching Meng Yun's indifferent attitude, Lin Jia suppressed her emotions and quickly walked to the door, pushing the neatly packed luggage. Meng Yun lay on the sofa, indifferent, glancing at Lin Jia. As Lin Jia walked to the door to change her shoes, Meng Yun placed her hand on the doorknob, hesitating to make a move.
0:10:11|0:10:24|She gave a last glance at [Meng Yun], but when [Meng Yun] turned around, she had already turned and pushed the door open. [Meng Yun] felt nervous and quickly got up to look towards the door. [Lin Jia] hesitated outside the door for a long time, as if waiting for [Meng Yun] to change her mind.
0:10:24|0:10:29|But [Meng Yun] was too stubborn, so [Lin Jia] had no choice but to close the door and leave.
0:10:29|0:10:52|[Meng Yun] saw [Lin Jia] leaving, he sighed heavily, his face filled with worry. He pulled back the blanket on him, frowned at the TV, not expecting things to escalate to this point. He rubbed his face harshly with his hand, trying to wake himself up. Meanwhile, [Lin Jia] had already reached downstairs, hesitating to take another step forward.
0:10:52|0:11:13|[Meng Yun] stood at the window, staring down at [Lin Jia]. [Lin Jia] involuntarily looked up at [Meng Yun] but quickly hid behind. [Lin Jia] walked away disappointed and determined. In the evening, Yu Fei and [Ding Dian] were eating hot pot at a hot pot restaurant. Yu Fei kept texting on his phone.
0:12:33|0:12:47|Yu Fei was chewing on something while typing quickly on his phone. [Ding Dian] stared at Yu Fei with a look of suspicion, put down his chopsticks and said, Yu Fei raised his head with a distracted look, and calmly said
0:13:17|0:13:25|[Ding Dian] raised an eyebrow and reached out towards Yu Fei. Yu Fei held his breath and deliberately handed over the phone slowly. Just then, the phone rang, and Yu Fei suddenly looked up, struck by a sudden inspiration.
0:13:44|0:13:49|In the next scene, Meng Yun and Lin Jia arrived at the bar. Ding Dian poured the drinks with a serious expression on his face.
0:15:15|0:15:31|Yu Fei stood up suddenly, angrily pointing at [Ding Dian]. [Ding Dian] smirked smugly, causing Yu Fei to suppress his anger and sit back down. He forced a smile, picked up a glass of wine and drank it, to which [Ding Dian] nodded in satisfaction.
0:16:25|0:16:31|Nodding and sneering, Meng Yun looked up at [Ding Dian], who widened his eyes in confusion.
0:16:45|0:16:57|[Ding Dian] couldn't help but stand up, waving her hand to hit [Yu Fei]. She picked up the small night light on the table and tried to smash it towards [Yu Fei]. [Ding Dian] solemnly dropped the night light on the table, sat down, and looked at [Yu Fei] angrily, unable to speak, then kicked the table hard.
0:16:57|0:17:4|The next day, as the sky began to brighten, Meng Yun was sleeping on the sofa in his coat. He was awakened by the sound of someone brushing their teeth.
0:17:16|0:17:21|Meng Yun looked up and saw two suitcases on the ground. He sighed and asked him,
0:18:15|0:18:21|Night falls, the city is brightly lit, and [Meng Yun] is still working overtime at the company.
0:18:30|0:18:47|[Meng Yun] listened to his colleagues' conversation and smiled, then looked down at the calendar on the table. It read Tuesday, August 16th. His mind drifted back to the past, remembering another Tuesday many years ago. [Lin Jia] was waiting for [Meng Yun] at the movie theater entrance, with her hair tied in a ponytail and wearing sneakers.
0:19:19|0:19:46|[Lin Jia] was also staring at the calendar, thinking back to their past Tuesday appointment. With a heart in turmoil, [Lin Jia] disappointedly lowered his eyes, unable to hide the sadness on his face. In the dark room, the books on the table were illuminated by the desk lamp, casting light on [Lin Jia]'s pale face. Unable to resist any longer, she picked up her phone and took the initiative to contact [Meng Yun]. [Meng Yun] was resting on the sofa when he heard his phone ring. He was momentarily stunned, then opened the message to find [Lin Jia]'s new address.
0:19:46|0:19:55|[Meng Yun] watched as the emotions of missing someone on his phone disappeared completely. All that was left was stubbornness, and he coldly replied with a curt "okay."
0:20:18|0:20:36|[Lin Jia] fell silent, unwilling to admit her hidden thoughts. She denied it vehemently, but [Ding Dian] looked at her with disbelief, disdainfully pursing his lips. [Lin Jia] remained silent, focusing on eating the noodles in her bowl. Seeing this, [Ding Dian] reached out and hugged [Lin Jia].
0:20:38|0:20:49|[Ding Dian] looked aggrieved, [Lin Jia] sighed and looked up, while on the other side [Yu Fei] walked towards [Meng Yun] who was sitting on the sofa lost in thought. [Yu Fei] sat down next to [Meng Yun] as he spoke.
0:21:26|0:21:52|[Meng Yun] picked up his clothes and got up to leave. Everyone in the bar was swaying their bodies on the dance floor, sparks flying indoors, lights flashing continuously. Every person on the scene was happily dancing. [Meng Yun] moved his stiff body, with a beautiful woman swaying behind him. He glanced back, almost losing control, then lowered his gaze and looked away. [Yu Fei], on the other hand, was having a great time, shouting continuously.
0:22:18|0:22:45|At this moment, everyone raised their glasses and cheered loudly, lifting the glasses above their heads and clinking them in the air, then everyone drank up. Meng Yun gradually got into the mood after finishing a glass of wine, following the beautiful women at the scene and swaying constantly. Meng Yun and Yu Fei got tipsy, following the music and interacting with the beautiful women around them. The two of them played more and more excitedly, entering a state of revelry. Then Yu Fei took out a stack of white paper and kept handing it out to everyone. Meng Yun asked in confusion,
0:22:56|0:23:11|After a night of revelry with [Yu Fei], the next morning, [Meng Yun] placed a cardboard box on the table and held a photo frame in her hand. After hesitating for a moment, she reluctantly put the photo frame into the box and hoarsely said to the aunt beside her,
0:23:19|0:23:34|Aunt nodded, [Meng Yun] continued to lower her head to tidy up things. At this moment, [Yu Fei] walked out of the bedroom shirtless. [Meng Yun] excitedly moved her body along with [Yu Fei]'s words. Aunt looked at the expressions on their faces, feeling speechless.
0:23:34|0:23:46|[Yu Fei] pointed directly at [Meng Yun], giving a thumbs-up to Auntie. He picked up a glass of water and walked into the bedroom, supporting his waist. [Meng Yun] paused, nodded at the action in his hand, looking puzzled.
0:23:49|0:23:56|The aunt misunderstood the relationship between [Yu Fei] and [Meng Yun], her face filled with curiosity.
0:24:4|0:24:21|[Meng Yun] nodded in agreement and gave a thumbs up to [Yun Fei]. The two of them then went surfing in the river, with the staff in front driving a speedboat, pulling [Meng Yun] along the water surface. Two motorboats followed on both sides of the speedboat, filled with bikini-clad beauties. [Meng Yun] and [Yun Fei] each rode a motorboat, with beauties behind them.
0:24:22|0:24:38|At night, [Meng Yun] drove [Yu Fei] and the beauties to the next event. Meanwhile, [Lin Jia] was cooking noodles alone at home, lost in thought. She didn't notice the water in the pot had dried up. Suddenly realizing this, she hurriedly found a cup of water and poured it into the pot, then fell into contemplation again.
0:24:38|0:24:48|On the other side, [Ding Dian] sat alone on the sofa, holding a bottle of red wine and pouring it into his mouth. He then put down the bottle and lay on the sofa, venting his emotions.
0:24:49|0:25:8|[Meng Yun] and [Yu Fei] were back at the bar, with the table full of glasses. They then each escorted a beautiful woman into the casino, pushing piles of chips to the center of the table. As they won big, the scene shifted to [Ding Dian] rear-ending a big brother's car, continuously bowing and apologizing. Meanwhile, [Lin Jia] was being criticized by the boss for a work mistake.
0:25:9|0:25:26|While [Meng Yun] and Yu Fei were cheering wildly at work, they went to the internet cafe to high-five each other for winning a game. Later that night, they went to a bar to chat with a group of beautiful women and added them as friends by scanning QR codes. [Lin Jia] flipped through the photos on her phone, looking at the pictures of herself and [Meng Yun]. [Ding Dian] lay next to [Lin Jia], feeling downcast and staring blankly ahead.
0:25:26|0:25:39|[Lin Jia] looked at the photo with a slight smile on her face. The next day, [Meng Yun] and Yu Fei were by the pool with water guns, shooting at the girls in swimsuits. The two were pushed into the pool by the screaming girls in groups, falling heavily into the water.
0:25:39|0:25:54|Shortly after, Meng Yun and Lin Jia lay quietly on the beach sunbathing, while a few men behind them chased a beautiful woman with water guns as she ran and laughed.
0:26:31|0:26:38|As soon as the words fell, a group of girls holding water guns ran past them laughing, and the two people turned back at the same time.
0:26:51|0:27:0|[Meng Yun] turned his head and pulled down his sunglasses, revealing his eyes as he looked at Yu Fei and said, "Today, the two of them locked eyes for a moment, then he took out a water gun from behind."
0:27:48|0:27:54|Yu Fei picked up the phone in disbelief,
0:28:14|0:28:20|Everyone showed a gossipy look, listening attentively.
0:28:55|0:29:5|At the dining table, everyone raised their glasses. Yu Fei finished his drink in one gulp, slammed the glass heavily on the table, and said fiercely,
0:29:33|0:29:37|[Meng Yun] stood beside Yu Fei, watching him deep in thought.
0:29:46|0:30:10|The scene shifts, [Meng Yun] and Yu Fei are sitting in the back seat of a car, with Yu Fei sleeping on [Meng Yun]'s shoulder. [Meng Yun] looks down at the sleeping Yu Fei, who looks lonely leaning against the seat. On the other side, [Ding Dian] is also sound asleep. Beside her, [Lin Jia] looks at her phone placed aside, longing for a message from [Meng Yun] that never comes, while [Meng Yun] is also waiting for a message from [Lin Jia].
0:30:10|0:30:22|He also looked down at his phone, confirmed that he had not received any messages, and then closed his eyes in disappointment. The next day, [Lin Jia], [Ding Dian], and Ke'er sat in the coffee shop.
0:31:11|0:31:19|[Lin Jia] looked at [Ding Dian] without saying a word, [Lin Jia] helplessly turned to look at Ke'er, and [Ding Dian] put down the cup and said,
0:32:45|0:32:52|Meng Yun and Lin Jia each picked up a glass of wine, clinked glasses, drank it down in one gulp, and then simultaneously put down their glasses.
0:33:2|0:33:9|Yu Fei lowered his head and fell silent for a moment before saying, [Ding Dian] nodded, turned and took something from beside him.
0:33:23|0:33:30|[Ding Dian] realized that he had let slip some information and quickly corrected himself.
0:34:7|0:34:13|Yu Fei looked helplessly at [Ding Dian], then turned his head to continue searching for things.
0:34:39|0:34:55|Yu Fei was choked and couldn't speak, he bowed his head and pressed a series of numbers. The two turned around at the same time to find something, only to find that they both took out a cup at the same time. They looked at each other's things and fell silent for a moment.
0:35:1|0:35:23|A pair of couple cups suddenly broke the tense atmosphere just now. The two fell silent, their expressions becoming lonely. [Ding Dian] uncomfortably bit her lip. Yu Fei broke the silence first, raising his cup. [Ding Dian] followed suit and clinked glasses with him. Meanwhile, [Meng Yun] had fallen asleep on the sofa. He woke up, moved the pillow aside, and took out his phone.
0:35:40|0:35:47|Meng Yun made a few phone calls but couldn't make any appointments. He slumped on the sofa in despair, while at this time Yu Fei and Ding Dian were already drunk.
0:36:18|0:36:34|As soon as Yu Fei finished speaking, Ding Dian suddenly felt nauseous, turned his head and was about to vomit. The waiter next to him immediately grabbed a trash can and rushed forward. Seeing the shocked expression on Yu Fei's face, the waiter hurriedly explained that it was late at night, Meng Yun was driving home, and his thoughts were pulled back to the past.
0:36:40|0:36:46|[Lin Jia] poured an egg into the pot of boiling noodles, then gently broke it with chopsticks.
0:36:49|0:36:58|[Lin Jia] finished speaking with a proud expression, while [Meng Yun] stood by watching her with a face full of indulgent smiles. As [Meng Yun] was eating noodles, [Lin Jia] asked
0:37:2|0:37:16|At this moment, [Meng Yun] was feeling a mix of emotions. When he got home, he couldn't help but start browsing [Lin Jia]'s Weibo. As he looked at the photos on Weibo, memories flooded his mind.
0:37:25|0:37:49|[Meng Yun] stared at the computer, his thoughts pulled back to reality. He closed the computer in disappointment, took off his glasses and put them on the coffee table. Rubbing his tired eyes, he leaned back on the sofa, closed his eyes. On the other side, [Lin Jia] had already boarded the plane to Dolphin Bay. It was still dark outside, and everyone on the plane was asleep in their seats.
0:37:49|0:38:9|[Lin Jia] sat by the window, her head leaning against the window lost in thought, with a desolate expression on her face. The next morning, a messy hotel room floor was strewn with clothes and shoes, [Ding Dian] and Yu Fei lay on opposite sides of the double bed, their naked bodies wrapped in blankets with blank expressions.
0:38:17|0:38:52|[Ding Dian] nodded in agreement, looking ahead with a vacant gaze. The two of them avoided each other's eyes, creating an atmosphere filled with awkward ambiguity. Just as [Ding Dian] was about to say something, she saw that Yu Fei had already closed his eyes and gave him a big eye roll. The scene then shifted to [Lin Jia], who had arrived at Dolphin Bay. The blue sea shimmered under the sunlight, and looking down from above, a small island came into view. Its shape resembled a small fish swimming in the middle of the sea.
0:38:57|0:39:6|The scene shifts to above the town, with the jungle surrounding the town. In the town stands a sign with the words "Welcome to Menado" written in English.
0:39:6|0:39:36|In the town, there is a famous landmark called the Flying Jesus Statue. [Lin Jia] is praying under the sculpture, then she walks to a corridor with triangular frames, admiring and taking photos back and forth. Afterwards, she goes to the boat, puts on diving equipment, and jumps into the water upside down from the boat. The seaweed underwater keeps floating with the seawater, and the underwater world is full of coral and small fish. Under the sunlight, the seabed becomes particularly vibrant and lively. Groups of dolphins swiftly twist their bodies and swim forward. [Lin Jia] sits on the edge of the boat watching the dolphins.
0:39:36|0:39:48|Lin Jia's hair danced in the sea breeze, the sunlight shining down on the dolphin's body as it continuously surfaced at the bow of the boat. Lin Jia enjoyed the comfort brought by the sun and sea breeze at the bow.
0:39:51|0:39:59|She was attracted by a fish tail pendant at a roadside stall, she picked up the necklace and it sparkled in the sunlight.
0:40:2|0:40:11|Receiving a call from [Lin Jia], [Ding Dian] felt guilty and had to lie.
0:40:44|0:40:51|[Lin Jia]'s smile froze on her face.
0:41:26|0:41:43|[Meng Yun] flipped through [Lin Jia]'s moments with a furrowed brow, his face filled with worry. He couldn't help but click on every photo, carefully examining them, afraid of missing any information related to her. At that moment, [Yu Fei] walked over with a water cup.
0:41:54|0:42:9|[Yu Fei] sat up straight, feeling guilty, so he changed the subject. [Meng Yun] furrowed his brow and handed the phone to [Yu Fei] to see for himself. [Meng Yun] looked serious and took a sip of water.
0:42:31|0:42:40|[Meng Yun] pointed at the photo on the phone and showed it to [Yu Fei]. Taking a closer look, [Yu Fei] looked puzzled and said, while [Meng Yun] nervously swallowed saliva beside him.
0:43:2|0:43:8|Meng Yun's eyes gradually became uncertain, seeking help as he looked at Yu Fei. Yu Fei understood his thoughts.
0:43:28|0:43:43|The two of them were leaning on the table, earnestly studying [Lin Jia]'s Moments. At this moment, [Lin Jia] was standing on the hotel balcony, supporting herself in a dress, wearing a newly bought necklace around her neck. In the distance, the setting sun had already dipped below the sea level, and the sky was gradually darkening.
0:44:5|0:44:27|He casually picked up the coffee bag on the table, and what caught his eye was a sticky note from [Lin Jia] with a message reminding to buy coffee when it runs out, signed by "wife". [Lin Jia] finished her trip and reunited with [Ding Dian], who curiously touched the new necklace on [Lin Jia]'s neck. [Lin Jia] then explained the origin of the necklace to the two. Meanwhile, [Meng Yun] was getting his hair done at the barber shop.
0:44:27|0:44:41|The receptionist handed Meng Yun the bill and gestured for him to sign. He lowered his head but froze when he saw Lin Jia's name all over the bill. After a long silence, he signed his own name, put down the pen slowly, and left.
0:44:41|0:44:56|Back home, Meng Yun took out all the toilet paper rolls from the bag and placed them in the bathroom. At this time, Lin Jia was attending a classmate gathering. When Wang Xin, who had a secret crush on Lin Jia, saw Lin Jia arriving late, he hurriedly stood up. The classmates pulled Lin Jia to sit next to Wang Xin.
0:44:58|0:45:13|The crowd cheered and raised their glasses, [Lin Jia] turned around and clinked glasses with [Wang Xin], whose gaze remained fixed on [Lin Jia]. After the party, [Wang Xin] insisted on taking [Lin Jia] home.
0:45:32|0:45:48|[Wang Xin]'s words stung [Lin Jia], causing her to fall silent. She turned to look out the window, and [Wang Xin] nervously asked her. [Lin Jia] remained silent, then slowly turned back and said,
0:45:59|0:46:5|[Lin Jia] leaned against the car window and stopped talking, and [Wang Xin] didn't dare to disturb her.
0:46:5|0:46:31|At night, it suddenly started to rain heavily outside. [Lin Jia] lay in bed tightly wrapped in a blanket, the lamp on the bedside was on. She kept coughing due to a cold from the changing season, with a blanket outside the quilt. She, with a pale face, closed her eyes and reached out to touch her forehead, seeming to have a fever. The thunder outside woke up [Meng Yun]. As he put on clothes, he walked towards the window. After putting on his clothes, he looked at the heavy rain outside and quickly closed the window.
0:46:31|0:46:51|He looked out the window, pondered for a moment, then quickly took out his phone. Opening the calendar, he realized today was the Autumn Equinox, his eyes filled with worry. Slowly lifting his head to look outside, he recalled that in previous years, Lin Jia always caught a cold and fever during the change of seasons, and he was always by Lin Jia's side.
0:47:26|0:47:47|[Meng Yun] touched [Lin Jia]'s face and affectionately said, while on the other side, [Lin Jia] searched the entire room but couldn't find the medicine. She had no choice but to go back to bed and lie down. Weakly, she picked up her phone, wanting to call [Meng Yun], but hesitated with her finger hovering over the number.
0:47:47|0:47:55|At this moment, [Meng Yun] also opened [Lin Jia]'s WeChat, mustered up the courage and typed a line, "The season has changed, how have you been?"
0:47:55|0:48:21|When he was about to send it, [Lin Jia] hesitated. She looked at her phone, unwilling to let go of her pride. She closed her eyes in disappointment. After some contemplation, [Meng Yun] deleted the message. Angrily, he exited WeChat, turned off his phone, and got up to find the medicine he had prepared for [Lin Jia] earlier. He opened a drawer, took out one medicine bottle after another to confirm, then found a medicine box where various types of medicine were neatly organized, including cold medicine and fever reducers.
0:48:22|0:48:30|He sat back on the sofa, took out a plastic bag, put the pills in one by one, packed them up, dialed a number on his phone, and then put it to his ear, waiting.
0:48:30|0:48:47|On the other side, [Lin Jia] had already fallen asleep when her phone suddenly rang. She groggily opened her eyes to find an incoming call. Slowly waking up, she hurriedly reached for her phone. However, upon seeing the screen, her expression darkened. It turned out to be a call from [Wang Zi].
0:49:9|0:49:16|[Meng Yun] was asked a question and was left speechless, not knowing how to answer, so she remained silent.
0:49:36|0:49:55|[Meng Yun] pretended to be relaxed and said, hanging up the phone. He casually threw his phone on the coffee table in front of him, sat on the sofa, clasped his hands together, and fell into contemplation. He turned his head to look outside the window where the rain was pouring down. The camera then shifted to the hospital, where [Wang Zi] was standing by the bedside, with [Lin Jia] receiving an IV drip on the bed.
0:49:55|0:49:59|[Wang Zi] looked at [Lin Jia] with an unstoppable worry in her eyes.
0:52:4|0:52:18|[Ding Dian] nodded as if understanding, picked up the phone and took a picture, the smiles on the faces of the three people disappeared without a trace.
0:52:36|0:52:56|The scene shifts to three people arriving at a bar for a gathering. A group of people surrounded a table filled with red wine, chatting and laughing. [Lin Jia] and [Ding Dian] live together, she is painting the walls with a brush, sticking new wallpaper on them. They hang clothes together and tidy up the living room. After the bar gathering, they finally took a photo together for memory, and even added each other as friends.
0:52:56|0:53:14|[Lin Jia] is busy setting up the new home, with windowsills filled with green plants. He and [Ding Dian] cook together in the kitchen, enjoy meals together at the dining table, and use a camera to capture moments of life. [Lin Jia] also no longer rejects [Wang Zi]'s advances, trying to accept him. She holds a painting in her hand, looks at it for a long time, and then hangs it on the wall.
0:53:14|0:53:20|[Meng Yun] and Yu Fei were drinking in the bar,
0:53:35|0:53:42|Yu Fei opened his mouth but couldn't say anything, turned his head and sighed deeply.
0:53:46|0:53:55|[Meng Yun] frowned and bit her lip, when a man with glasses walked over.
0:56:16|0:56:24|[Meng Yun] finished speaking with a disdainful curl of her lip.
0:57:7|0:57:22|In front of Yu Fei appeared two supercars, [Meng Yun] showed a proud smile, looking at Yu Fei.
0:57:37|0:57:50|Yu Fei quickly took the key of a sports car while [Meng Yun] wasn't paying attention, and the two of them sat side by side in the restaurant, eagerly waiting.
0:58:17|0:58:25|The two of them high-fived in sync, and Meng Yun suddenly thought of something, setting down his glass and saying,
0:58:35|0:58:48|Yu Fei turned his eyes around, thinking and looking, when [Meng Yun] suddenly smiled evilly. The two of them laughed heartily, then felt it was inappropriate, and looked around pretending to be serious.
0:58:48|0:59:12|Two beautiful women walked out of the restaurant at this moment, causing all the men in the room to turn their heads to admire. They were wearing short skirts and knee-high socks, holding hands and swaying their hips dramatically as they approached Yu Fei and [Meng Yun]'s table. Without any hesitation, they sat down, casually throwing their bags on the chairs. The camera then focused on the two of them. These twins looked completely different. [Meng Yun] and Yu Fei's expressions became very unnatural, awkwardly forcing out a smile.
0:59:12|0:59:28|They exchanged a glance, the atmosphere becoming awkward, as the twin sisters quietly waited for their cue. [Meng Yun] forced a awkward smile, looking at the twin sisters and asking, the scene once again plunged into awkwardness.
0:59:54|0:59:58|[Meng Yun] and Yu Fei's smiles gradually disappeared. [Meng Yun] gestured for Yu Fei to say something.
1:0:10|1:0:28|After cautiously asking, Yu Fei's smile turned tense. The two held hands tightly, waiting for the outcome. Yu Fei covered his face in despair, while [Meng Yun] joyfully clenched his fist. Yu Fei looked at his sister's sturdy appearance, feeling hopeless.
1:0:39|1:0:56|Four people arrived at the KTV. The elder sister stood on the table singing, wildly flipping her hair. [Meng Yun] and Yu Fei stared at the sister with their wine glasses, not daring to move. The rough-looking younger sister sat quietly on the sofa, her voice sweet and melodious.
1:1:1|1:1:5|Meng Yun turned back to look at the twin sisters, pondered for a moment, and then said,
1:1:10|1:1:16|[Meng Yun] glanced at his sister and couldn't bear to look directly at her. He closed his eyes, put down his glass, took off his glasses, and looked at Yu Fei, saying,
1:1:25|1:1:30|Yu Fei turned back to look at his sister, then turned back with a helpless look at Meng Yun, who widened her eyes and said,
1:1:38|1:1:56|[Meng Yun] looked to Yu Fei for help, deliberately making a pitiful expression. Yu Fei frowned tightly, showing a pained expression, and sighed deeply. [Meng Yun] clenched her fist to encourage him. Yu Fei could only grit his teeth and forced a smile as he walked towards his sister, picking up a glass of wine and handing it to her.
1:2:14|1:2:34|Yu Fei and his sister left, with his right hand behind his back gesturing "ok" to [Meng Yun]. His sister leaned on [Meng Yun]'s chest, and [Meng Yun] helped her to the passenger seat while distractedly watching the sports car drive away.
1:2:37|1:3:4|[Meng Yun] forgot that there were only two seats in the car, feeling awkward and at a loss. He pursed his lips and had to call a taxi. As soon as he finished speaking, the sports car ahead had already driven far away. The driver turned around and said that the designated driver had already arrived at the destination ahead of time. He was smoking leisurely leaning against the car, with several cigarette butts piled up under his feet.
1:3:9|1:3:18|[Meng Yun] looked at the designated driver in confusion, only to find his face covered in lipstick marks. The designated driver smiled and wiped off the lipstick from his face.
1:3:24|1:3:34|The driver flicked his hat brim with his hand and left energetically. Meng Yun opened the car door and looked inside, only to see her sister lying on the seat in disarray, completely disregarding her own image.
1:4:17|1:4:31|Yu Fei's half face was swollen, one eye completely unable to open, [Meng Yun] hesitated to speak, organizing his thoughts in his mind, Yu Fei nodded to indicate him to continue speaking, especially curious.
1:6:32|1:6:55|Yu Fei swelled up half of his face and pretended to look fierce at [Ding Dian]. Faced with Yu Fei's aggressive questioning, [Ding Dian] shamefully lowered his head. The big brother at the next table couldn't help but give Yu Fei a thumbs up. [Ding Dian] looked up at him with a grievance. [Ding Dian] was scared by Yu Fei, his eyes widened in confusion, and then he cried in grievance.
1:8:2|1:8:13|As soon as the words fell, Ding Dian's phone rang. Without hesitation, Ding Dian picked up a glass of wine and drank it all.
1:8:30|1:8:43|Ding Dian, with a disdainful look, watched as Yu Fei received the notification right after showing off.
1:8:50|1:9:15|[Ding Dian] brought a whole bottle of wine to Yu Fei at the table, tapped the bottle twice to signal Yu Fei to finish it. The night's streetlights illuminated the leaves. [Meng Yun] sat slouched on the sofa, flipping through his phone. The chat history between him and Lin Jia when they confessed their feelings was displayed on his phone. He looked at their ambiguous interactions and fell into contemplation. Then he started to laugh foolishly at his phone. Suddenly, as he was looking at it, he stopped. Lin Jia messaged him asking where he was.
1:9:15|1:9:37|He coldly replied, saying that he was socializing. Seeing this, he put down his phone and seemed to understand why he and [Lin Jia] had reached this point. Suddenly, he turned his head to look at a table not far away covered with a tablecloth. He walked over, pulled back the tablecloth, revealing design sketches and unfinished drafts. He turned on the desk lamp above the table and began flipping through the design drafts that [Lin Jia] had not taken away.
1:9:37|1:9:44|The last one is a rough sketch of two dolphins swimming together. He remembered holding Lin Jia's hand behind her while drawing.
1:9:56|1:10:10|[Lin Jia] was alone in the dark house, reminiscing about the past without turning on the lights, making the room feel particularly desolate. She looked out at the empty street, while inside the house, there was only her. The painting of two dolphins hung on the wall.
1:10:13|1:10:29|The city lights gradually fade away, and the sky is getting brighter. [Yu Fei] and [Ding Dian] are lying on a double bed again. Wrapped in a blanket, they stare blankly like last time. [Ding Dian] shakes her head and says,
1:10:44|1:10:49|In the evening, [Meng Yun] and [Yu Fei] were having dinner at a hotpot restaurant.
1:12:8|1:12:19|[Meng Yun] pointed to the sign of the hotpot restaurant behind him with chopsticks, [Yu Fei] followed his direction and saw the words "Next Door Lao Wang" written on it. [Lin Jia] sat in the car looking out at the open KTV across the street.
1:12:24|1:12:41|The driver, [Wang Xin], smiled warmly and shook his head quickly to indicate no need to thank. On the other side, [Meng Yun] was driving with [Yu Fei] in the car. When [Yu Fei] received a call from [Ma Gou], his face lit up with a smile. Suddenly, his tone became serious, and he glanced nervously at [Meng Yun] who was driving beside him.
1:12:54|1:13:6|[Meng Yun] glanced at [Yu Fei] while holding the steering wheel, with [Yu Fei] sitting next to him waiting for his decision. [Meng Yun] scratched his head with his hand, pondered for a moment, and then casually said to sharply turn the steering wheel and make a U-turn.
1:13:7|1:13:16|[Meng Yun] drove recklessly, feeling extremely anxious, as the speed of the car kept increasing.
1:14:24|1:14:45|[Meng Yun] turned her eyes as if thinking of a solution, then looked at [Yu Fei]. The scene shifted to [Ma Gou] holding a glass of wine as he sneaked into the private room of [Lin Jia] and [Ding Dian]. He pretended to be familiar, sitting next to a man and whispering mysteriously. [Lin Jia] and [Ding Dian] looked at them in confusion, and the man, shocked, raised his head with shining eyes and followed [Ma Gou] without a word.
1:14:45|1:14:55|In another private room, [Meng Yun] and [Yu Fei] sat on the sofa, smiling and waving at the men brought in by [Ma Gou]. Around them, a dozen beautiful women sat, all turning their heads to stare at him together.
1:14:58|1:15:18|At one point, Meng Yun and Ding Dian's private room was empty of men. They moved to another room, where they were immersed in laughter and joy. Each person was surrounded by five or six beautiful women playing games with them. In the midst of this interaction, the men seemed to have forgotten about Meng Yun and Ding Dian. They were happily toasting, busy drinking and exchanging contact information with the ladies around them.
1:15:54|1:16:5|[Ding Dian] pulled [Lin Jia] out and prepared to inspect each private room along the corridor. The lights in the hallway changed colors, with [Lin Jia] following [Ding Dian] slowly, her face maintaining a calm expression throughout.
1:16:5|1:16:17|Meng Yun and Lin Jia searched several private rooms but found nothing. They continued to search forward and happened to meet Ding Dian coming out of a room. Ding Dian immediately turned back upon seeing them, realizing he couldn't hide anymore. He then turned around and forced a smile.
1:16:44|1:17:7|[Lin Jia] couldn't help it and hurriedly interrupted Yu Fei. Yu Fei paused for a moment and replied. Upon hearing Yu Fei's response, [Lin Jia] showed a hint of disappointment in her expression. Yu Fei gestured towards the door of the private room, indicating [Lin Jia] to look for herself. [Lin Jia] quickly went forward and peered at the door to search for [Meng Yun]'s figure, while [Meng Yun] was not far away watching everything. With her hopes dashed, [Lin Jia] dejectedly lowered her arm and sadly ran away.
1:17:8|1:17:17|[Ding Dian] hurriedly followed, not forgetting to turn back and glare at Yu Fei. [Meng Yun] stood at the corner, watching everything in front of her but never coming out.
1:17:31|1:17:44|[Lin Jia] looked very dejected. She pulled up [Ding Dian]'s off-the-shoulder top, forced a smile, then pushed her onto the sofa. Turning around, [Lin Jia] walked away. [Lin Jia] watched [Ding Dian] leave, feeling uneasy, and stood up.
1:18:4|1:18:22|[Meng Yun] picked up a glass of wine and placed it near his mouth, shaking his head helplessly. He then drank up the wine in the glass. [Lin Jia] curled up alone on the outside stairs, feeling sad. She hugged herself tightly with her hands, feeling weak and helpless. She lifted her head buried in her knees, tears welling up in her eyes. Looking up at the sky, she tried to hold back her tears.
1:18:22|1:18:28|The neon lights behind flicker constantly, illuminating the loneliness of [Lin Jia] at this moment.
1:18:36|1:19:1|Upon hearing Ma Gou's words, [Meng Yun]'s expression changed slightly, but soon he pretended to be calm. He avoided the gazes of Ma Gou and Yu Fei, trying to appear indifferent. With a bitter smile and a conflicted look, he put down his glass, said nothing, and walked away. Ma Gou was still shocked, while Yu Fei remained calm as if he had known it would end this way. [Meng Yun] walked alone in the corridor, his face full of worry and reluctance.
1:19:1|1:19:11|He quickened his pace towards the exit, while glancing back to see if there was any sign of [Lin Jia] around. The closer he got to the exit, the more anxious [Meng Yun] became, at this moment he desperately wanted to see [Lin Jia].
1:19:11|1:19:19|At this moment, [Lin Jia] was still sitting on the steps at the door, staring into the sky absentmindedly. Suddenly, a message came in. [Lin Jia] lowered her head, wiped away tears, and picked up her phone to read it.
1:19:21|1:19:45|On Meng Yun's phone was a message from [Wang Zi], who told her that he had never left. Lin Jia then came to her senses, looked around to find Wang Zi's location, and soon Meng Yun ran out from the entrance of Haoledi. After looking around, Meng Yun immediately ran towards the stairs. When he reached the stairs, Meng Yun looked ahead in shock, only to see a car parked on the road.
1:19:45|1:20:5|[Wang Zi] opened the car door and escorted [Lin Jia] to sit in the passenger seat. [Meng Yun] smirked self-deprecatingly, as if he were a clown at this moment. He watched as [Wang Zi] took away [Lin Jia], feeling like he didn't even have the right to question. He could only grit his teeth and remain silent.
1:20:55|1:21:17|[Lin Jia] finished showering and changed into clean clothes. Upon hearing the notification sound, she sat on the edge of the bed, picked up her phone, only to see that [Meng Yun] had already retracted the message. [Lin Jia] looked at the screen thoughtfully, unsure of [Meng Yun]'s intentions. She pondered how to respond to [Meng Yun]'s sudden initiative. After a moment, she replied to [Meng Yun], asking if he was at the KTV just now.
1:21:18|1:21:43|After typing the message without hesitation, she eagerly wanted to know if [Meng Yun] still cared about her. After sending the message, she put down her phone and fell into contemplation again. For some reason, she changed her mind and retracted the message she had just sent. The scene shifted to Meng Yun, who was drunk and crying uncontrollably in the KTV, with [Yu Fei] gently patting his back to comfort him.
1:21:45|1:21:58|[Lin Jia] was touched by the recent news, falling into contemplation. She lay on the bed, resting her head against the headboard, let out a deep sigh. The streetlights outside and the light shining through the windows echoed each other, illuminating the lonely night.
1:22:52|1:23:11|[Yu Fei] hung up the phone with a frown, sighed helplessly, turned to look at [Meng Yun], who smiled back. [Yu Fei] patted [Meng Yun]'s shoulder with a sigh, slapped his own waist, and walked away. [Meng Yun] watched [Yu Fei] leave with an envious look unconsciously.
1:23:20|1:23:26|[Meng Yun] came to a social gathering for work and drank the wine offered by the client. He carefully said,
1:24:11|1:24:18|The girl smiled sweetly at everyone, and Mr. Zhou indulgently said to the girl,
1:24:53|1:24:57|[Wang Zi] opened his big talking eyes and smiled playfully at [Meng Yun],
1:25:17|1:25:27|[Wang Zi] sneaked into [Meng Yun]'s meeting room and tapped his shoulder. [Meng Yun] was pleasantly surprised to see [Wang Zi] in front of him, looking completely different from the person at the wine table. He couldn't help but stare at [Wang Zi] from head to toe.
1:25:34|1:25:43|[Meng Yun] accompanied [Wang Zi] to visit the company's design drawings. The two stood by the window flipping through the design drawings. [Meng Yun] explained them carefully to her, and then introduced [Wang Zi] to Yu Fei.
1:26:0|1:26:5|The two of them slowly got closer and closer,
1:26:25|1:26:32|On the other side, the relationship between [Lin Jia] and [Wang Xin] is getting closer, just like how [Wang Zi] is around [Meng Yun] at this moment.
1:26:40|1:26:48|It's not because of fear, but because of loneliness. The scene shifts, [Meng Yun] looks at [Wang Zi] who is cooking instant noodles for him, and can't help but think of [Lin Jia].
1:27:8|1:27:20|The scene shifts, [Wang Xin] brings a small dog to find [Lin Jia], and the two happily take care of the dog together. Meanwhile, [Meng Yun] is explaining a new design proposal to the client, with [Wang Zi] sitting below, looking up at her with admiration and appreciation.
1:27:21|1:27:28|After the meeting, everyone walked out,
1:27:37|1:28:4|[Wang Zi] suddenly turned around and stuck out his tongue at [Meng Yun]. Yu Fei and his subordinates stood aside, watching as Zhou Zong and his group left. Meanwhile, [Wang Xin] and [Lin Jia] arrived at a small restaurant. [Wang Xin] looked at [Lin Jia] and grinned foolishly, asking her to stand in front. They found a seat and sat down. The restaurant owner greeted them warmly, and after a quick glance, [Lin Jia] immediately understood. The owner turned and walked into the kitchen.
1:28:44|1:28:52|[Wang Xin] felt even more embarrassed, laughing uncontrollably, when the boss walked in with the food.
1:28:57|1:29:18|Wang Xin handed a bowl of rice to [Lin Jia], who took a spoonful and tasted it. Wang Xin waited for [Lin Jia]'s feedback. [Lin Jia] looked up with a surprised smile, causing Wang Xin to smile involuntarily with a look of indulgence. In the evening, [Meng Yun] and [Wang Zi] were taking a walk. [Wang Zi] casually pushed aside a tree branch in front of them.
1:29:22|1:29:38|[Wang Zi] didn't respond to [Meng Yun] and looked up to ask him. Upon hearing this, [Meng Yun] stopped in his tracks and stood still, giving [Wang Zi] his back. After a while, he slowly turned around, furrowing his brows, and looked at [Wang Zi] seriously. He didn't want to deceive [Wang Zi], so after some contemplation, he nodded.
1:29:39|1:30:1|[Wang Zi] seemed to have already guessed the answer, he asked persistently, looking nervously at [Meng Yun], a hint of anticipation flashing in his eyes. [Meng Yun] smiled at [Wang Zi], and without hesitation, nodded in agreement, not wanting to deny it. [Wang Zi] looked at [Meng Yun], waiting for his response, but [Meng Yun] remained silent. The smile on his face gradually faded, as he did not provide an answer, only a smile.
1:30:3|1:30:6|[Meng Yun] was touched in her heart, but still asked knowingly.
1:30:9|1:30:22|Waiting for the other party to let go first, when [Wang Zi] bluntly pierced through the knot in his heart that he didn't want to mention, [Meng Yun]'s face instantly changed, tears welled up in his eyes. He realized he had lost control and quickly avoided [Wang Zi]'s gaze, looking to the other side.
1:30:22|1:30:30|He didn't deny that the atmosphere was too oppressive, [Wang Zi] had to be the first to break the silence.
1:30:50|1:31:5|[Wang Zi] returned home and couldn't contain her curiosity about [Lin Jia]. She lay on the bed holding her laptop, wanting to search for any clues about [Lin Jia]. Fortune favors the prepared mind, and she finally found [Lin Jia]'s Weibo. [Wang Zi] looked at the computer screen and rolled her eyes.
1:31:5|1:31:23|The next day, [Wang Zi] came to the café downstairs from [Lin Jia]'s company hoping for a stroke of luck. She wondered if she could run into [Lin Jia] here, so she pushed the door open and walked in. As she walked in, she looked around, [Ding Dian] was sitting at the front desk playing with her phone, while Ke'er greeted [Wang Zi] with a polite smile.
1:31:23|1:31:42|[Ding Dian] glanced at [Wang Zi], who smiled back at him. [Wang Zi] then looked around absentmindedly, until his gaze landed on a table behind the front desk. There was a package on the table with the name [Lin Jia] written on it. Upon receiving confirmation, [Wang Zi] found what he was looking for and smiled contentedly.
1:31:44|1:32:6|[Ding Dian] felt something was wrong, furrowing her brows as she looked at [Wang Zi] with suspicion. [Wang Zi] walked to the window by the door and placed her small backpack down before sitting. She gazed at the stickers on the wall, then glanced around with [Meng Yun] staring at her from the side, his eyes full of doubt. After a while, [Lin Jia] elegantly entered in high heels. At that moment, [Wang Zi] didn't know she was [Lin Jia], but couldn't help being drawn to her gaze.
1:32:14|1:32:23|[Lin Jia] turned her head towards the door following [Ding Dian]'s words, [Wang Zi] looked at [Lin Jia] with a pair of innocent big eyes, her gaze fearless, filled with conviction and confidence.
1:32:23|1:32:31|The two of them stared at each other like this, and [Lin Jia] was the first to look away, her eyes full of a sense of crisis. She calmed herself down and turned to [Ding Dian], saying,
1:32:34|1:32:57|Ding Dian hadn't reacted yet, Lin Jia turned and walked away. She was slowly walking with a coffee in her hand, her gaze unwilling to move away from Wang Zi. Wang Zi also stared at Lin Jia without flinching, the two of them looking at each other as if engaging in an invisible game. They were evenly matched, not giving in, probing each other's confidence, until Lin Jia walked past Wang Zi and out of the coffee shop.
1:32:57|1:33:17|[Wang Zi] breathed a sigh of relief when she saw [Lin Jia] leave, slumping into a chair. In the quiet of the night, [Lin Jia] sat at the office desk staring blankly. The entire company was empty except for [Lin Jia], with only a dim light shining in the dark office. Tears welled up in her eyes as she sat there, looking as if she had lost her soul.
1:33:17|1:33:23|She took off the necklace around her neck and held it in her palm, gently stroking it. The fish-tail shaped silver pendant looked particularly dazzling under the light.
1:33:25|1:33:42|[Lin Jia] tightly clenched it in her hand, then ruthlessly threw it on the table. The necklace fell onto the tabletop, making a crisp sound. [Lin Jia]'s emotions at this moment were like the discarded necklace. She buried her head in her hands on the table, tears hanging down like beads with broken strings.
1:33:42|1:34:2|At this moment, [Meng Yun] was working overtime at the company, staring at the computer screen while drinking coffee. Suddenly, his phone rang, causing him to stop his work and turn to look at it. He answered the phone, his expression changing immediately. He stood up and went to find [Lin Jia].
1:34:31|1:34:52|Ding Dian's words woke Meng Yun up, piercing his heart like a knife. He put down all his pride and self-esteem, frantically called Lin Jia. At this moment, Lin Jia was already disheartened, drinking at home with Wang Xin. When she saw Meng Yun's call, there was no ripple on her face. She raised her wine glass and drank heavily, getting herself drunk.
1:34:52|1:35:6|Tears suddenly welled up in her eyes, she closed them in pain, lowered her head and took a deep breath, wiping away the red wine from her lips. [Wang Xin] looked at [Lin Jia] with concern, as [Lin Jia] hung her head.
1:35:38|1:35:45|[Lin Jia] looked up at [Wang Xin] with slightly red eyes, then shifted her gaze away and said
1:36:28|1:36:36|[Lin Jia] poured out her heart, tears filling her eyes as she lowered her head and sobbed silently.
1:37:2|1:37:21|[Lin Jia] buried her head even lower, tears streaming uncontrollably. These words, which had been pent up in her heart and never spoken to anyone, were now pouring out because of [Wang Zi]'s appearance. [Meng Yun] had been unable to reach [Lin Jia].
1:37:29|1:37:34|In the neighborhood, the dim lighting made [Meng Yun] run around in circles, unable to find [Lin Jia]'s residence.
1:37:42|1:37:51|The scene shifts to the bedroom of [Lin Jia], where [Wang Zi] tucks her in. As he stands up to leave, his hand is grabbed by [Lin Jia].
1:37:58|1:38:5|[Wang Zi] grabbed [Lin Jia]'s hand without saying a word, while at this moment [Meng Yun] finally arrived at [Lin Jia]'s house. He stood at the door, his expression changed.
1:38:25|1:38:36|After venting his emotions, Meng Yun gradually calmed down. He leaned against the wall, still breathing heavily with his eyes closed. He tried to digest the pain, then opened his eyes and looked at the shoes by the door.
1:39:13|1:39:34|Gently wiping away the tears from the corner of his eye, [Lin Jia] looked at [Wang Zi] with a hint of strangeness in her eyes. [Meng Yun] stood up and walked to [Wang Zi]'s side, who looked like a child who had done something wrong and was at a loss. Before anyone could speak, [Meng Yun] embraced [Wang Zi] and kissed him, while on the other side [Lin Jia] also hugged [Wang Zi] and kissed him. The scene then shifted back to the past, with [Meng Yun] and [Lin Jia] leaning on each other on the sofa.
1:40:12|1:40:19|After today, [Meng Yun] and [Lin Jia] entered a new life.
1:40:59|1:41:23|[Meng Yun] pulled his arm out from under [Wang Zi]'s head and got up to leave. [Wang Zi] was sleeping soundly on the bed, completely unaware of [Meng Yun]'s departure. [Meng Yun] stood alone on the balcony smoking a cigarette. [Wang Zi] woke up and quietly walked to the living room, watching [Meng Yun]'s melancholic figure. [Meng Yun] was oblivious to [Wang Zi]'s presence, still staring out the window as if missing someone.
1:41:23|1:41:28|[Wang Zi] seems to see through [Meng Yun]'s mind, empathizing with his pain.
1:41:28|1:41:43|She silently leaned her head against the wall, digesting the torment in her heart alone. It's because she understands Meng Yun too well that she feels this pain at this moment. Like a lost soul, she turned around and leaned against the wall. The two of them stayed in the same room, but their minds were in different places.
1:41:43|1:41:56|[Wang Zi] accompanies [Meng Yun] in this way, this love has already left her breathless. On a quiet night, [Wang Zi] and [Meng Yun] walk on a deserted path, the ground damp as if it had just rained.
1:41:58|1:42:4|[Wang Zi] suddenly stopped. [Meng Yun] looked back at her in confusion. He turned around and asked her with concern,
1:43:6|1:43:10|[Wang Zi] looked up at [Meng Yun], tears swirling in her eyes.
1:43:17|1:43:22|[Meng Yun] looked at the girl in front of him, who he had treated with care, feeling too upset to say anything.
1:44:8|1:44:39|[Wang Zi] forced back tears and still smiled at [Meng Yun]. [Meng Yun] hesitated, unsure of how to respond to [Wang Zi]. He didn't want to disappoint the girl in front of him who loved him wholeheartedly, but he couldn't deny what [Wang Zi] said - he couldn't deny that he still had feelings for [Lin Jia]. [Wang Zi] reached out a finger and smiled at [Meng Yun], then pointed to the empty street ahead.
1:44:42|1:44:46|[Wang Zi]'s emotions are slowly breaking down, tears swirling in his eyes.
1:45:7|1:45:35|[Wang Zi] had tears welling up in her eyes, she gave a faint smile to [Meng Yun]. She watched [Meng Yun] slowly step back, and as he turned around, tears streamed down her face. She deliberately slowed down her pace, tears flowing, while [Meng Yun] stood still in place. Since [Wang Zi] didn't confront the situation, he could naturally continue to deceive himself and [Wang Zi] could go on like this.
1:45:36|1:45:50|He now realizes that he can't let go of [Lin Jia] while also hurting [Wang Zi]. His hesitation is not just because of his obsession with [Lin Jia], but also because he lacks the confidence to give [Wang Zi] one hundred percent of his love. He doesn't want to disappoint another good girl again.
1:45:51|1:46:15|[Meng Yun] resolutely closes her eyes and dares not face [Wang Zi]. [Wang Zi] stands at the intersection, leaving [Meng Yun] a back view. She is aware of [Meng Yun]'s thoughts but is unwilling to give up any hope. [Meng Yun] struggles in his heart to the extreme, unable to help but look back. He has made a choice, choosing to face his own feelings, choosing to let go of this self-deceiving happiness.
1:46:15|1:46:42|[Wang Zi] understood, turned and ran towards the corner. [Wang Zi] couldn't hold back anymore, bursting into tears. The sound of her crying echoed from around the corner in the dim light. [Meng Yun] stood straight in place, staring blankly in the direction where [Wang Zi] was. The scene fades to black, then transitions to [Meng Yun]'s home where he and Yu Fei are sitting on the sofa watching TV.
1:47:12|1:47:32|[Meng Yun]'s eyes dimmed, as if he had made a decision. Meanwhile, [Lin Jia] was packing at home. She picked up a painting, gently caressed it, and sat quietly on the sofa. Something in her heart couldn't let go. The night was bright with lights on the street, and vehicles were constantly passing by.
1:47:32|1:47:40|[Meng Yun] drove fast on the road, with a serious expression. [Lin Jia] put the flowers back in the box, realizing that everything could not go back to how it was.
1:47:40|1:48:4|At night, the square is bustling with people, a young man on a bicycle showing off his skills by the roadside, and a singer playing the guitar freely on the side. [Meng Yun] walks straight to the center of the square with a bag on his back, passing by one couple after another. He stops in the center of the square, puts his backpack on the ground. The scene shifts to [Lin Jia]'s home, the room is empty and tidy, [Lin Jia] crouches behind the coffee table, where there are several cardboard boxes.
1:48:4|1:48:25|[Lin Jia] looked serious, as if she had made a decision. She gathered her courage and tore off the tape on the box. On the other side, [Meng Yun] took out a burlap robe from his bag, which belonged to the Monkey King. He put on the robe and tied the belt around his waist. [Lin Jia] turned the box upside down, emptying its contents onto the coffee table. What caught their eyes was a pile of mangoes.
1:48:25|1:48:47|She poured out the mangoes from another box, and for a moment the coffee table was piled with mangoes. [Meng Yun] took a tight hoop from the bag at his feet with bare feet, and there was a hint of sadness on his cold and indifferent face. He smiled bitterly, slowly lifted the tight hoop and put it on his head. Passersby occasionally looked at [Meng Yun] curiously, wondering what he was doing.
1:48:47|1:49:6|[Meng Yun] closed his eyes tightly and put on the tight headband curse, while at this moment, [Lin Jia] gathered up courage and started peeling a mango. She cried bitterly, with determination and stubbornness written on her face. She couldn't control her tears, but her hands kept moving. [Meng Yun] looked into the distance, then lowered his head. He gritted his teeth and shouted,
1:49:44|1:49:53|Pedestrians in the square stopped in their tracks and watched Meng Yun. Soon, a crowd gathered around her, and Lin Jia, after finishing one mango, went for another, losing her composure.
1:49:54|1:50:5|She crazily gnawed on the mango on the table, soon her body started to have an allergic reaction, her face turned red, she reached out to grab the sheep while continuously gnawing on the mango.
1:50:8|1:50:42|[Meng Yun] was surrounded by more and more people, some even started taking photos with their phones. [Meng Yun] shouted regardless, tears flowing freely down her face. [Lin Jia] began to break out in hives on her neck and arms, still crazily biting into a mango. [Lin Jia] reached out to scratch the hives on her arms, with a look of unbearable pain on her face, mango pulp smeared around her mouth. [Meng Yun] also gradually became hysterical, releasing the emotions that had been building up inside her during this time. [Lin Jia] uncontrollably started scratching the hives on her body.
1:50:44|1:51:15|Her allergic reactions were getting worse, her face swelling as she chewed on the mango. [Meng Yun] cried until she choked, tears streaming down her face, while [Lin Jia] weakly coughed. Finally, a group of security guards surrounded [Meng Yun], watching the lively crowd around them. Some people were cold and indifferent, some covered their mouths with red eyes, and others showed worried looks.
1:51:15|1:51:39|[Meng Yun] struggled to stay, being dragged by four security guards, while [Lin Jia] lay on the table, her allergic reaction making it unbearable for her, she gradually lost consciousness and fell on the table, passed out in a pile of mangoes. [Meng Yun] had completely lost his mind, crying and howling, the security guards had to press him to the ground, forcibly covering his mouth with their hands, forcing him to be silent. Suddenly, [Ding Dian] and [Wang Zi] burst in with medical staff.
1:51:39|1:52:3|On the other side, [Meng Yun] was pressed to the ground by the security guards, the headband on his head fell off. Meanwhile, everyone helped [Lin Jia] up from the table and laid her on the sofa. The doctor hurried forward to check the situation. [Meng Yun] was struggling in pain, with the security guards covering his mouth and pressing his head. He stubbornly reached out to grab the fallen headband on the ground, but his arm was held down by the security guard. [Lin Jia] was lying on the sofa, still holding something in her hand.
1:52:3|1:52:22|Unfinished mango, densely packed red rashes and scratch marks on the arm were a shocking sight. The two bid farewell to their relationship in such a tragic way. A year has passed, and [Lin Jia] is sitting on the lawn with the child of [Wang Zi] in her arms.
1:53:11|1:53:21|[Meng Yun] sorted through the design drawings in his hand, looked up, and the person in front of him froze. He smiled with joy, glanced at the design drawing, then looked up at [Wang Zi] and said,
1:53:21|1:53:43|[Wang Zi] replied, the sunlight shining in from the window, casting on their faces. They smiled at each other, as if the story had entered a different ending. The scene transitioned to a blackout, and time rewound six years ago. The girl by [Meng Yun]'s side back then was [Lin Jia], with [Meng Yun] wearing black-framed glasses. They walked hand in hand, [Lin Jia] with a ponytail.
