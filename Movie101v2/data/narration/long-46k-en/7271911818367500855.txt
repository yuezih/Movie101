0:1:7|0:1:25|The camera slowly pans across, revealing the picturesque waterside scenery unfolding like a scroll. The distant village appears particularly tranquil, with a few children playing in the pond, while adults gather at [Wang Zhao]'s house to play mahjong. At the mahjong table, a person directly facing [Wang Zhao] speaks up.
0:2:0|0:2:2|Relatives visit with children and gifts.
0:2:17|0:2:41|To entertain the relatives who came from afar, [Wang Zhao] started paddling the boat again. He planned to catch some fish to bring back home for the dinner with guests. On the way to catch fish before paddling the boat, [Wang Zhao] greeted his neighbors. After catching the fish, [Wang Zhao] returned to the village. At this moment, the old village chief suddenly ran over in a hurry.
0:2:57|0:3:21|After getting off the boat, the two hurried to the scene. By the pond, a crowd had already gathered. [Wang Zhao] went forward to check the situation, and found a child who had been in the pond where water was stored. [Wang Zhao] turned the child over and patted him firmly and gently.
0:3:41|0:3:48|At night, the old village chief celebrated at Wang Zhao's home with baijiu, and he was the first to speak.
0:5:28|0:5:45|During the casual conversation, dinner came to an end. The next morning, [Wang Zhao] was surprised to find countless dead fish floating in the pond in front of the door while getting up to wash. Looking at the muddy pond water and the countless fish stirring up white clay, [Wang Zhao] was filled with resentment.
0:5:45|0:5:51|Early risers noticed this strange phenomenon and began to gather together to help [Wang Zhao] retrieve the dead fish from the pond.
0:5:59|0:6:4|The angry villagers all crowded into the village chief's house, wanting to seek justice for the matter.
0:6:22|0:6:26|Unsatisfied with the results, the group angrily got into the car and drove towards the chemical factory.
0:8:49|0:9:0|At this moment, Wang Zhao also rode over on a bike. He scolded the crowd and managed to calm the situation down.
0:9:12|0:9:26|At the persuasion of the village chief, the matter was left unresolved. Reluctantly, everyone pushed the cart away, many unwilling to let the chemical plant off so easily. On the way back to the village, the villagers started gossiping again.
0:9:46|0:9:53|The village chief took three people to the township to report issues. In the township mayor's office, the atmosphere was particularly tense. The township mayor spoke up.
0:10:7|0:10:32|After listening to the villagers' grievances, [Wang Zhao] also felt helpless. After a moment of silence, he picked up the phone on the table and called the health center, trying to solve the current problems for the villagers. The village chief and the people in the village came to the water's edge to take samples for inspection.
0:10:39|0:10:51|During the sampling process, [Wang Zhao] squatted by the water for inspection. The village chief pondered for a moment, stood up, and turned to the villagers.
0:11:20|0:11:39|The crowd left satisfied with the answer, only [Wang Zhao] continued to paddle the boat, fishing dead fish in the reeds. This pond used to be everything in his life, but now he felt lost. He brought all the hard-earned dead fish to the entrance of the chemical plant, silently expressing his anger.
0:11:44|0:12:1|After speaking, [Wang Zhao] set down the dead fish and turned to leave. He once again busied himself in the pond without stopping for a moment, just like before. Every day, he would tirelessly catch fish on the boat, but this time, it was not for a living like before, but to vent the bitterness in his heart.
0:12:1|0:12:20|The pond that the villagers rely on for survival has been polluted by the discharge from the chemical factory. [Wang Zhao] couldn't bear this anymore. This time, he scooped up a basket full of dead fish again. Just like before, he took the dead fish to the entrance of the chemical factory, where the security guard turned around to see him bringing another basket of dead fish.
0:12:22|0:12:34|But [Wang Zhao] put down the dead fish this time and turned around to leave, without saying a word. Like this, one net after another, one basket after another, he seemed tireless, shuttling back and forth between the pond and the chemical factory.
0:12:35|0:12:56|And this time, even the factory director wanted to personally see what this person was up to. After a few more days passed without any news from the village, even the villagers couldn't sit still. They beat drums and gongs to gather everyone, wanting to ask whether the village's issues could be resolved.
0:13:44|0:13:52|Not long after, [Wang Zhao] rode his bike to the mayor's office in a hurry, anxiously asking the mayor how the problem had been resolved.
0:14:36|0:14:47|The village chief waited outside the office, while the township head was on the phone, seemingly communicating something. After a while, the township head nodded repeatedly with a happy expression, indicating that they had reached an agreement on certain matters or plans.
0:14:49|0:15:2|The village chief hung up the phone, tidied up quickly, and went out to greet the old village chief who was waiting outside the door.
0:15:2|0:15:14|Wang Zhao and [Ma Dongmei] left together. The scene shifted to a group of children playing in the pond. It seemed that the pollution from the chemical factory had not had a significant impact on people. The gloom of the dead fish from before had disappeared from the children's minds.
0:16:29|0:16:38|It's another early morning, [Wang Zhao] went out to wash up as usual. This time, he hesitated for a moment in the courtyard, then turned and walked towards the edge of the pond.
0:16:43|0:16:53|Life seems to have returned to the previous scene, with people gathering around the pond again, chatting and laughing. The pond is still the center of everyone's life.
0:17:11|0:17:37|Two of them wearing blindfolds plunged into the water, watching the rippling surface. It was uncertain who would emerge victorious in this competition. After a while, the challenger surfaced first, while everyone was still searching for [Wang Zhao]. After the match, [Wang Zhao] returned home.
0:18:44|0:18:47|On this day, [Wang Zhao] noticed a commotion on the shore while fishing.
0:18:53|0:19:9|He didn't have time to think much, quickly putting down the work in his hands and following the shouts. When he arrived at the scene, he found that two people had fallen into the water at the same time, greatly increasing the difficulty of the rescue. In a moment of urgency, [Wang Zhao] stabilized the boat, grabbed the nearby fishing net, and threw it down.
0:19:9|0:19:13|After trapping the two with a fishing net, [Wang Zhao] began to drag them towards the side of the boat.
0:19:17|0:19:29|The two people who fell into the water were eventually rescued with the efforts of [Wang Zhao] and others. After getting on the boat and taking a closer look, it turned out that one of the people who fell into the water was Director Lu from the chemical factory. After regaining consciousness, Director Lu quickly thanked the people who saved him.
0:19:34|0:19:41|[Wang Zhao] said, then turned and got off the boat. After returning home, Director Lu's family prepared a sumptuous dinner.
0:20:48|0:20:50|He has been living for over ten years, in which year did he not save one or two people?
0:21:59|0:22:4|Wang Zhao had no choice, while at this time, a different scene was unfolding at the factory director's home.
0:24:3|0:24:13|[Wang Zhao], surrounded by the crowd, slowly walked forward. He took hesitant steps, looking a bit shy, but little did he know that he would be tripped by the steps at the end, causing laughter among the crowd.
0:24:31|0:24:42|The one presiding over the county government meeting is Director Zhang, who had dinner with Chief Lu. [Wang Zhao] from Xiaogang Village is like a traditional fisherman casting his net.
0:24:51|0:24:57|At this moment, [Wang Zhao] happened to be in town looking for a fellow villager to cut his hair.
0:25:26|0:25:29|At the same time, at the county government meeting, everyone was still deadlocked.
0:25:36|0:25:42|It is explained that he still lacks the spirit of self-sacrifice to save others deep down.
0:26:2|0:26:9|It's all about courageous actions. He has seen many people.
0:26:42|0:27:1|After the officials at the county government finished their discussion, they ultimately decided not to commend [Wang Zhao] for his courageous proposal. At that moment, [Wang Zhao] was still at home with his wife Meilian, completely unaware of what was about to happen. On this hot summer night, the two of them lay quietly in bed, with Meilian fanning herself by the side.
0:27:2|0:27:13|The slight breeze made Wang Zhao turn his back, the two remained silent, but his wife secretly smiled, as if she had thought of something, her smile getting bigger and happier, causing Wang Zhao to turn back.
0:27:35|0:27:47|Marianne covered her face shyly while laughing. Gradually, this gentle laughter turned into a hearty chuckle. [Wang Zhao] noticed something unusual and turned to inquire.
0:27:56|0:28:0|Mellian turned over and hugged the sleeping Wang Zhao beside her.
0:28:22|0:28:30|The two of them spent the night together like newlyweds. The next day, at the awards ceremony, the venue was packed with people, and many media reporters rushed over upon hearing the news.
0:28:58|0:29:12|And among this group of role models, everyone is wearing silk with the words "act bravely in a just cause" printed on them. The meeting officially began, as if everything had been arranged properly. Only [Wang Zhao] was sitting at the very edge, and not wearing anything.
0:29:14|0:29:25|Wang Zhao noticed something unusual and stood up, intending to leave. However, when he turned and walked towards the villagers, he was stopped.
0:29:43|0:29:48|The style of the new era farmers, portrayed by [Wang Zhao].
0:30:2|0:30:10|Later, during the media coverage, [Wang Zhao] also entered the frame, but the reporters had doubts about [Wang Zhao]'s identity.
0:30:23|0:30:35|Faced with the demands of the reporters, [Wang Zhao] didn't know how to explain, so he just left cheerfully. He didn't go far, just squatted on the side. After the reporters left, he returned to his seat and sat down.
0:30:35|0:30:47|All the villagers of Xiaogang Village, including [Wang Zhao] himself, firmly believe that [Wang Zhao] should be the role model hero. When the reporter filmed for the second time, he walked slowly over and once again captured [Wang Zhao] who was not wearing anything.
0:30:48|0:31:16|The reporter raised his hand this time, gesturing to the police officers maintaining order behind. Upon seeing the situation, the police officer on the scene quickly approached, questioned [Wang Zhao] about the situation, and asked him to leave. [Wang Zhao] remained unfazed by this.
0:32:6|0:32:29|Upon hearing this, [Wang Zhao] was completely stunned, and the old village chief quickly stepped forward, using both hands to support him and leading him away from the scene. The villagers of Xiaogang Village all hung their heads in shame, as the award ceremony proceeded vigorously, but the villagers could not find any joy in it.
0:32:45|0:33:9|Watching the role models holding flowers, everyone felt uneasy. [Wang Zhao] returned home and started drinking alone, while Meilian sat at the door wiping away tears. At that moment, the village chief suddenly visited, and the couple invited him to sit down.
0:33:18|0:33:30|Mellian added a pair of chopsticks for the village chief, poured wine, and took the opportunity to complain. Mellian stood beside the village chief and whispered.
0:34:16|0:34:32|After leaving the home of [Wang Zhao], the old village chief once again arrived at the office door of the township mayor. This time he didn't know how to speak up, standing outside the door hesitantly, only able to keep glancing inside. His not-so-subtle actions still caught the attention of the township mayor, who warmly invited him in.
0:36:15|0:36:22|The old village chief who received the reply hurried back to the village and found [Wang Zhao] fishing, informing him of the uplifting news.
0:36:39|0:36:45|The situation became clear, and the two of them couldn't contain their joy.
0:38:51|0:38:56|The matter ended unresolved, and when Wang Zhao was having dinner at home, suddenly a visitor arrived.
0:39:58|0:40:6|After Meilian left, Wang Zhao began to consider this issue. After the meeting, Wang Zhao waited at the door for the village head to come out.
0:40:9|0:40:15|The village chief was rebuked into silence. In such a serious meeting with the presence of the provincial TV station reporter, he disrupted the order and tarnished the reputation of our village for the sake of his own fame and fortune.
0:40:45|0:41:4|The village chief vented all the grievances he had received from the director on [Old Village Chief]. [Old Village Chief] was momentarily unable to understand the village chief's emotions and the contrast in his attitude. After greeting, [Wang Zhao] sat down next to the village chief's table.
0:41:21|0:41:34|Facing the visit of [Wang Zhao], the village chief had nothing good to say. This resentment was passed down level by level, and in the end, it all fell on [Wang Zhao], leaving him sitting there at a loss.
0:41:37|0:41:42|The village's recommended model of bravery ultimately ended up being shunned by everyone, taking small steps.
0:42:41|0:42:59|Even though even his family has started to take advantage of his resignation, for [Wang Zhao], he can't swallow this anger. The next day, he went to the county and found the petition office, and then resolutely walked in. Standing at the front desk of the petition office, he began to inquire about the person on duty here.
0:44:7|0:44:33|Realizing that this was the only way, [Wang Zhao] did not dwell on it too much, turned around and sat down to start filling out the form. As she was filling out the form, another petitioner walked into the office. Comrade Xiao Su took the materials, looked through them, and handed a blank form from the desk to the petitioner. After finishing the form, [Wang Zhao] stood up and handed the form to the front desk.
0:44:36|0:44:48|He wanted to say something more, but didn't want to trouble unrelated people, so he had to give up. Sun Ming and the others were discussing together.
0:44:51|0:44:57|At this moment, [Mei Lian] appeared. Hearing her husband being talked about like that by others, [Mei Lian] felt very uncomfortable, but there was nothing she could do.
0:45:19|0:45:44|The shopkeeper turned around and placed the goods on the table. [Mei Lian] counted out enough money from her hand and handed it to the shopkeeper. It seemed as if the previous incident had never happened, and [Mei Lian] didn't want to discuss it further. But [Wang Zhao] was particularly concerned about the outcome of the petition she had filed. A few days later, she went to the petition office again to inquire about the situation.
0:46:49|0:47:3|The people in the office made a reasonable point with their words. [Wang Zhao] left once again in disappointment. Back in the village, he always seemed gloomy, wondering if it was just his imagination. The way the villagers greeted him was also different from before.
0:47:8|0:47:26|Almost everyone had some criticisms about his previous actions. For a while, he became the opportunistic figure who chased after personal gain and had low ideological awareness. At the street corner, he encountered those villagers who loved to gossip.
0:47:37|0:48:6|[Wang Zhao] once again came to the county to inquire about his own affairs. This time he finally got a response and happily went home to wait for further notice. While having dinner at home, he seemed to be in a much better mood, knowing that he would soon meet with the leader. At that moment, his wife [Mei Lian] walked over with the meal.
0:48:15|0:48:30|Say it, [Mei Lian] finished cleaning up the empty bowls and left. She gradually lost interest in [Wang Zhao]'s affairs. She didn't believe that the leader would eventually meet [Wang Zhao] at all. [Wang Zhao] seemed to sense something unusual, but she still chose to trust the leader.
0:48:30|0:48:38|Time passed day after day, and [Wang Zhao] still sat at the door, eagerly waiting for the notification that may or may not come.
0:48:54|0:49:11|On this scorching summer day, the simmering anger in the heart is constantly being provoked. The next day, in the office, [Wang Zhao] once again arrived at the petition office, but today there was a different receptionist.
0:49:39|0:49:41|He had no choice but to find another way.
0:52:9|0:52:23|Finally, [Wang Zhao] managed to catch a leader at the government entrance. In a great mood, he even started singing on his way home. Sitting beside him, [Wang Zhao] quietly picked up his chopsticks and started eating.
0:52:44|0:52:59|After listening to what [Wang Zhao] said, the atmosphere at the dining table started to become awkward and heavy. The words from Meilian seemed to awaken [Wang Zhao], when will this verbal promise finally be fulfilled?
0:52:59|0:53:10|These days, [Wang Zhao] lives and works as usual, spraying pesticides on crops during the day and catching fish in the evening. What's different from before is that he seems preoccupied with something.
0:53:12|0:53:29|But after days of constant contemplation and consideration, he had already made a decision in his heart. [Wang Zhao] and his wife Meilian at the dining table were always silent. She picked up the porridge on the table and drank it in one gulp, then turned to Meilian sitting next to her.
0:53:33|0:53:53|After hearing this, Meilian let out a long sigh, but no matter what, she still supported her husband's decision, hoping that this matter would have a good outcome in the end. At night, Meilian prepared the luggage her husband needed to bring to the county. [Wang Zhao] had made up his mind this time and was determined to seek justice for himself.
0:53:53|0:53:59|The two of them packed their luggage in silence. With everything ready, [Wang Zhao] solemnly bid farewell to his wife.
0:54:6|0:54:27|Speak, [Wang Zhao] turned and walked out the door, stepping firmly onto the road. The next morning, he stood at the county government's gate with his luggage, watching one person after another come and go. Basically, no one paid any attention to him, as everyone was busy with their own affairs.
0:55:22|0:55:41|Unable to get any answers, [Wang Zhao] was driven away by the security guards, leaving him with no choice but to retreat to a distance. The bustling traffic on the street drowned out his plea for justice. In front of the grand government gate, [Wang Zhao] appeared particularly small and helpless, sitting quietly by the flower bed, waiting.
0:55:41|0:55:43|Suddenly, he spotted a familiar figure.
0:55:50|0:55:56|[Wang Zhao] quickly caught up, but the other party showed no intention of stopping. The next morning.
0:56:3|0:56:16|Wang Zhao was met with the cold gaze of the security guard, so he could only turn around and leave dejectedly once again. He dragged his weary feet up the stone steps by the roadside, sat down cross-legged, wondering if this would be another fruitless day.
0:56:16|0:56:25|And at that moment, a familiar figure drove towards the gate. [Wang Zhao] looked up and recognized the person as the leader Li who had promised to help him before.
0:56:47|0:57:6|Upon hearing the phrase "wait for notification," he had heard it countless times. Can this so-called notification really be awaited? At night, [Wang Zhao] returned to the rental house he lived in. Inside the house was a large bunk bed where three people slept, the environment extremely poor. He lay on the bed unable to sleep, constantly pondering the events of the day.
0:57:6|0:57:14|With the continuous snoring of the person in the same bunk, he could only sit up. The next morning, he was still sitting at the government gate as usual.
0:57:15|0:57:26|When Leader Li rode by this time, he didn't even acknowledge him. He could only stare blankly at the leader's departing figure. Back in the rental house, even the neighbors started to show concern for him.
0:57:50|0:58:3|Wang Zhao's house lease expired at this time, and he was forced into a corner. However, he did not give up and still sat outside the government office in the morning, waiting. At that moment, Leader Li rode by on his bike and noticed Wang Zhao sitting on the roadside with his head down.
0:58:3|0:58:10|For some reason, Leader Li turned back with his bicycle and greeted [Wang Zhao].
0:58:32|0:58:46|After a long wait, [Wang Zhao] finally followed Leader Li into the county government, marking his first time entering the government's doors. Inside the office, Leader Li took out a certificate of honor from the cabinet and handed it to [Wang Zhao] sitting beside him.
0:59:14|0:59:42|At the dining table, [Wang Zhao] placed the certificate beside her, drinking and admiring it. Looking at this hard-earned honor, she couldn't help but smile with joy. Meilian used [Wang Zhao]'s towel to wipe her hands. She took the certificate as if it were a treasure, carefully admiring the cover first, then flipping it open and reading every word aloud.
1:0:1|1:0:13|Melian also looked at the certificate with joy, but soon her brows furrowed. She stood up and brought the certificate closer to the lamp above her head to examine it more closely.
1:0:24|1:0:34|Huang Zhao, with the certificate in hand, proudly walked out the door, thinking he could show off a bit. He first went to the house of the old village chief and shared the good news with him.
1:1:10|1:1:18|The village chief watched as [Wang Zhao] left with satisfaction, sighed deeply, and then [Wang Zhao] went to the mahjong place.
1:1:35|1:1:38|The crowd gathered together, examining Wang Zhao's certificate of honor.
1:2:5|1:2:18|The next day at mealtime, he continued to hold the certificate and look at it non-stop. Suddenly, Wang Zhao heard the broadcast outside, so he put down his chopsticks and planned to leave.
1:2:28|1:2:32|[Wang Zhao] happily walked out of the door, in the village committee, everyone sat together preparing for a meeting.
1:3:42|1:3:59|Things seemed to have come to an end, and life returned to its usual calm. [Wang Zhao], as usual, set out on a boat to fish, pushing the boat away from the small dock in front of his home with a pole. Following his usual routine, he began a day of work, just like he did every year at this time.
1:4:12|1:4:23|After Meilian finished speaking, she turned and went home, ending a day of work. [Wang Zhao] went to the village shop to buy wine. The villagers started discussing animatedly after [Wang Zhao] left.
1:4:44|1:4:48|When Wang Zhao returned home, a group of children followed noisily.
1:5:16|1:5:32|Wang Zhao was furious when he heard about it. He could sense that the villagers still had opinions about him. After thinking it over, he went straight to the village chief's house to demand an explanation, holding a newly bought bottle of wine in his hand.
1:6:29|1:6:48|The village chief's attitude towards [Wang Zhao] also changed. He returned home in anger, took out his certificate and carefully checked it. As soon as he opened the certificate, it was just as the village chief had said. There was no official seal on the certificate, and a sense of shame and indignation from being deceived suddenly surged in his heart.
1:6:51|1:7:1|He angrily threw the certificate on the ground, but no matter how hard he threw it, it couldn't solve his problem. The old village chief rushed over upon hearing the news, seeing the couple sitting in the house with worried expressions on their faces.
1:9:9|1:9:19|Things have come to this point, and no matter how hard [Wang Zhao] tries, he can't control his stubborn temper. The old village chief, seeing that he can't be persuaded, leaves in anger. The next day, [Wang Zhao] goes to find a lawyer.
1:9:36|1:9:42|After listening, [Wang Zhao] began to lower his head and rummage through the bag. He first took out a stack of bills, counted them, and found there were only three hundred.
1:10:0|1:10:14|He then started to search for change in his pockets, first in his pants pockets and then in his jacket pockets. However, no matter how hard he tried, he could only come up with a little over three hundred. Faced with this situation, [Wang Zhao] had no choice but to tell the truth.
1:10:21|1:10:33|This way, he put all his money in the lawyer's hands. When he went home, he didn't even have any change to take a bus, so he had to walk home.
1:10:37|1:10:44|The road ahead is long, but [Wang Zhao] strides forward with determination, believing he has done the right thing.
1:10:49|1:10:56|Night falls, with his wife Meilian waiting at the door for her husband to return. [Wang Zhao] enters the door with a weary body.
1:11:11|1:11:38|Mellian helped [Wang Zhao] lie down slowly on the bed, picked up the fan next to her and started fanning. As Mellian busied herself, she sat on the edge of the bed and asked how [Wang Zhao] was feeling today. [Wang Zhao] turned her head away, unwilling to speak.
1:11:56|1:12:7|[Wang Zhao] was also very angry, picked up the pillow and threw it out.
1:12:28|1:12:37|Every year he leaves like this. The next day, the lawyer and the village chief, along with a group of villagers, arrived at the village committee. Along the way, everyone was talking and discussing, not knowing what it was all about.
1:13:13|1:13:20|Lawyer Yang began to question the villagers one by one about some trivial matters concerning [Wang Zhao], while the others waited outside.
1:13:42|1:13:47|The lawyer nodded after listening, and the village chief, who was waiting outside anxiously, prioritized letting in a person who had received favor from [Wang Zhao].
1:14:35|1:14:46|After asking the villagers, Lawyer Yang went to the county government and questioned Director Li, who had issued the certificate to [Wang Zhao] before. Director Li calmly pushed the door open and sat down across from him.
1:15:3|1:15:6|Later, he also inquired about the county government leaders who had previously revoked Wang Zhao's model citizen status.
1:16:29|1:16:32|After a fruitless inquiry, [Wang Zhao] had to return to the law firm.
1:17:34|1:17:39|After leaving the law firm, [Wang Zhao] began to consider his next plan.
1:17:41|1:17:53|It's no longer just a simple certificate, but a way to seek an explanation for the humiliation he has endured for so long. Back in the village, he starts shuttling between households.
1:18:6|1:18:20|The first place they found was Xingye, and the two entered the house together. Xingye carefully examined the document in his hand, which was a joint application form that Wang Zhao wanted to submit.
1:18:21|1:18:27|[Wang Zhao] took out the seal and had Xingye press his fingerprint, but at that moment, Xingye's wife walked in.
1:18:41|1:19:2|[Wang Zhao] left the Xinye family and started traveling on the road again, searching for his next witness. He walked on foot along the rural road to the neighboring village, and this perseverance and determination could not be stopped by anyone.
1:19:2|1:19:11|[Wang Zhao] found the second person willing to prove himself for him. After arriving at the Da Yong family, he also successfully stamped his handprint. Upon completion, [Wang Zhao] accepted it with joy.
1:19:22|1:19:38|Even after experiencing so much, there are still people willing to testify for [Wang Zhao], but the long journey and hardships, even with a strong will, are hard on the body. No matter how difficult it is, [Wang Zhao] gritted her teeth and made it through. By the time she found the third house, it was already evening.
1:19:46|1:20:3|Wang Zhao could only give up without any results. Returning empty-handed, he had to go to the fourth house. Despite feeling exhausted, he continued on in the dark of night. By the time he reached the door, it was late at night, and he wasn't sure if the owner was asleep, so he went up and knocked on the door.
1:20:12|1:20:19|The lights came on in the room, but the people inside remained silent for a long time. [Wang Zhao] was rejected once again, after all, it was late at night.
