0:1:55|0:2:20|In the land of the Five Mountains, deep in the mountains, the bamboo forest grows lushly, with no trace of winter snow. Inside a small building, there is the melodious sound of silk and bamboo music, with about a dozen actors standing or sitting in white linen costumes. Their true faces are concealed by masks, dancing to the music with the grace of opening crystal stones, intertwining with sorrow in their every move.
0:2:20|0:2:28|Amidst the bitter cold of the Wu and Yue regions, the desolation and chilliness, one can sense the hidden worries and unspoken thoughts of the people here, hence the melancholy and sorrow.
0:2:30|0:2:39|Several light cavalrymen with capes were galloping through the mountains and heading towards the bamboo building at the same time.
0:3:21|0:3:42|In the small building, [Li Di] and the Ling people were still unaware. The words and songs danced on the bamboo couch, sometimes pulling the sleeves in front of them, looking pitiful, sometimes showing resentment and anger without complaint or regret, completely unaware that someone would visit the bamboo forest. After trekking through mountains, forests, and rivers, the court officials and guards arrived with the empress's decree.
0:3:42|0:3:57|The performer then covered his true face with a mask, the eunuch not knowing where [Li Di] was, so a group of people pushed the door and entered, walking to the spacious center of the building. Then they unfolded the imperial edict in front of them and read it aloud.
0:4:16|0:4:40|Behind the mask, Wan Hou sighed as he listened to the flowing water, reflecting on the customs of the late emperor. Although Li Di was close to his friend, the bond between ruler and subject, father and son, was hard to sever. Thus, the words of the palace eunuch made Li Di's eyes brim with tears, as he rode swiftly through the old city, his soul lost in his hometown, overflowing with emotions of returning home.
0:4:40|0:4:58|Li Di, also known as Wu Luan, the phoenix symbolizes peace and tranquility in the world. The name "Wu Luan" is a metaphor, indicating the ongoing wars and conflicts at that time. The scene shifts to a painting on the shore, where Yin Taichang is leading a procession. The emperor sits majestically under a luxurious canopy.
0:4:58|0:5:7|Among the countless palace maids in the entourage, there was one who was unparalleled in beauty. However, a poisonous scorpion suddenly leaped onto the paper, stopping at the place where [Yin Taichang] was. It touched the poison and spread it, corroding the painting.
0:5:8|0:5:21|After a moment, only the queen remained under the umbrella, indicating that there was a hidden agenda behind [Yin Taichang]'s pomp. The scene shifted to the capital city, where the imperial palace was illuminated by candlelight, casting a gloomy atmosphere all around.
0:5:22|0:5:39|In the grand hall, a woman in exquisite attire walks slowly. Observing her back, one can only feel that her cloud-like hair and graceful figure are as elegant as orchids and jade trees. Her form seems ethereal like a deity, with a demeanor that transcends mortal virtues. Her clothing is as ethereal as snowflakes in a moonlit night, exuding an aura of ethereal beauty.
0:5:39|0:6:4|The woman walked to the end of the main hall and saw a pair of feathered guards standing here, dressed in seven Kai with animal head masks, holding the original fire torch in one hand to observe the Tang clan, and boiling a black iron spear in the other hand to guard the electric gate. The solemn killing intent permeated the palace, making all who saw it feel awe. Behind the gate, there was a bronze giant gate, decorated luxuriously with golden animal head door handles.
0:6:4|0:6:24|Carving the grass and trees, the fish and insects are meticulously engraved with fine lines, without any gaps, as if there is light but the bottom is not visible, and it is unknown where this place is. The woman stands in front of the spirit tablet of [Wan Hou], calm and composed, showing no signs of panic. Such behavior has already established her status as a respected woman.
0:6:24|0:6:40|After she stood still, she saw that the guards showed no intention of giving way. She neither got angry nor anxious, but maintained a dignified posture, gazing calmly at the crowd, and then remained motionless. Seeing the woman stop in front of her, she stood silent and still like a mountain.
0:6:40|0:6:56|The crowd of Yulin guards were at a loss for a moment, and after a brief stalemate, they heard Gao Bingjia's curse clang, and then split into two left and right, leaving a passage for one person to pass through and watch the changes quietly. Seeing the woman without fear, she stepped into the Yulin guards.
0:6:56|0:7:16|In a procession, the women walked gracefully, unaffected by the nearby weapons and torches. They moved calmly through the narrow path, seemingly oblivious to the atmosphere of tension and death. As they approached the gate, several eunuchs and court officials bowed and opened the door, revealing the scene inside.
0:7:16|0:7:20|Every corner of the store was filled with lodgers.
0:7:20|0:7:42|Wan Hou realized that this was the late emperor, who had countless people placed on the platform, swaying with the Tang Dynasty style. He then saw a figure in golden armor among them. As a woman approached, following the gaze of the person in the golden armor, he finally saw the true face of the woman. She appeared as if the moon hidden in the blue clouds, drifting like the falling snow in a graceful manner.
0:7:42|0:7:48|Thus it was that the woman stood before him for a long time, gazing at him, before finally speaking with a hint of hostility,
0:8:6|0:8:11|Upon hearing the woman's words, the new emperor took off his helmet, carefully examined the mask in front of him, and then bent down to sniff it with his nose. This was an item belonging to the former emperor.
0:8:12|0:8:20|The woman, seeing her frivolous behavior, showed displeasure on her face, but then saw the new emperor slowly stand up and say in a low voice
0:8:22|0:8:56|Wan Hou carefully placed the helmet back on the wooden frame, then turned and walked towards the door of the shop. As he approached the woman, the new emperor whispered by her sickbed, and then continued walking towards the palace. The woman became a little flustered, her earrings swaying gently with her trembling body. The new emperor took a step forward and walked outside the palace, noticing that there was no movement from the person behind him. He then spoke to the eunuch Zhou Shen.
0:8:56|0:9:5|As the words were spoken, the bronze gates gradually closed, revealing a clear palace. The sound of the cold door axis breaking echoed in the air, lasting for a long time.
0:9:5|0:9:33|Tang Feng arrived in time, holding a torch aloft, the balance of yin and yang shifting like the unsettled emotions of a woman in the palace. Just as the fellow martial artists were still present, the new emperor turned around and raised his hand to halt the illusionary movement. The sound of the rotating mechanism abruptly ceased as the former emperor reached out and softly redirected the switch. A delicate jade head was then slowly placed on the palm of the hand, and finally the woman spoke.
0:9:35|0:9:54|The two held hands and listened to the words of the woman just now, knowing the situation in this room. Following the customs of the late emperor, the new emperor was predicted to make his elder brother's wife the empress. If not, the late empress would have to follow the late emperor in death. The woman pondered repeatedly and finally decided to protect herself by marrying the younger uncle.
0:9:54|0:10:18|At the same time, Emperor Qing dispatched the Yulin Guards to secretly rush to the Moon Bamboo Tower. They saw a group of people breaking through the obstacles, with beast heads and bird eyes, stepping on the grass and flowing to the west, relentlessly searching for [Wan Hou] sent by, tracing the whereabouts of the eunuchs, and forcing their way to where the Crown Prince was located, under the starry night. [Wan Hou] sat alone in the palace, holding the memorial tablet in front of her eyes, mourning the late Emperor.
0:10:18|0:10:33|The new emperor, who arrived quietly, snatched the plain silk from her hand and threw it aside onto the burning candle. The smell of burning and the flames attracted a group of eunuchs and palace maids, who hurriedly rushed forward to extinguish the fire. The new emperor, indifferent, stood behind [Wan Hou].
0:10:33|0:10:41|The scorching hand spreads to the countryside and reaches the Qinglong, feeling the fragrance of its flowers, but [Wan Hou] is heard saying
0:10:42|0:10:51|Hearing [Wan Hou] say so, the new emperor lifted his chin and spoke coldly.
0:10:56|0:11:6|The new emperor took out a small bottle from the Linlang Red Powder Pendant and handed it to [Wan Hou], then said,
0:11:14|0:11:26|The new emperor remained silent, only his assistant and [Wan Hou] intertwined to push away the light killing, soothing and calming down, squeezing towards the delicate and plump body, and then biting and tearing at her ear, with only the words written
0:11:33|0:11:56|[Wan Hou] protected her chest, stopped the new emperor's movements, and asked solemnly. The new emperor did not answer. After a moment of contemplation, he brought his lips close to [Wan Hou]'s delicate hair, and then asked softly. [Wan Hou] understood his intentions upon hearing this, and allowed the new emperor's hand to roam freely among the powder and rouge, as a kind of mist rose at some unknown time, lingering above the delicate beauty.
0:11:57|0:12:14|On the other side of the Wu and Yue bamboo forest, [Wan Hou] leaned to the left, the guard was unstable, and there was a sound of bamboo leaves falling in the distance. Looking up, she did not notice anything and continued to guard the small building where the prince was located. Little did she know that this disturbance was caused by the sight of a fierce wind roaring in the bamboo forest.
0:12:14|0:12:46|The new emperor, hidden in the rainforest, shot arrows from a hundred meters away, instantly killing the guards outside the building. The group moved forward in unison towards the bamboo building, but suddenly two figures flew out of the river, their splashes like dragons, intimidating the [Feather Guards] and others. The two, undaunted by the outnumbered situation, wielded their long swords, attacking instead of defending, demonstrating the essence of close combat.
0:12:46|0:13:14|Between the flash of lightning and the flint, several [Imperial Guards] were injured and retreated. In the close combat, although the two of them were able to hold off the [Imperial Guards], they were also seriously wounded, blood flowing profusely, seeping under their feet. The bamboo bridge was dyed red by the river water, a trickle of red flowing. Despite their struggle for breath, they still stood on the bridge with their swords, blocking the way. At the beginning of the fierce battle against the enemy, the [Imperial Guards] suffered a hidden loss.
0:13:14|0:13:43|As the emperor, the imperial guards are all seasoned warriors. [Wan Hou] quickly regained his composure and thought of a strategy. He saw a guard from the Feather Forest withdrawing while another guard, [Wu Luan], attacked with a whip. With just one exchange, the two guards felt the pressure increase significantly, finding it difficult to defend. The Feather Forest guard's tactics were indeed effective, showing a deep understanding of military strategies. After a moment, the battle whip pierced through the mountain.
0:13:43|0:14:7|Two guards were powerless to resist and were killed on the bridge. Just as Wan Hou was about to win by defeating three opponents, a figure holding a broadsword descended from the bamboo leaves, striking unexpectedly at the back of the Imperial Guards. This move caught them off guard, causing chaos in their formation. With a swift and fierce attack, the guards fell one after another, blood splattering on the bamboo bridge.
0:14:7|0:14:26|After reorganizing their formation, the two sides continued to fight. At the same time, during the previous struggle, the one who withdrew was already sneaking into the bamboo building. Inside, the masked performer had no weapons, yet still danced and sang as if fearless of life and death, seemingly oblivious to everything around, allowing [Yulinwei] to kill without resistance.
0:14:26|0:14:45|Outside the building, the guards of the Gate of the Tower were overwhelmed by the crowd and defeated. [Feather Guards] led by Binghe launched a massacre in the bamboo building, splashing blood three feet high from time to time. Amidst the enchanting music and elegant dances, masked performers danced between the floors of the building, causing the [Feather Guards] to rush around the building, killing.
0:14:45|0:15:9|In the center of the bamboo building hangs a white robe, with several words in the language of the Yue Kingdom written on it. It was personally passed down by the Crown Prince [Wu Luan], now stained with blood, resembling a winter plum with a wound, shocking to the eye. Yet the killings continue unabated, with countless people dead or injured, their bodies scattered throughout the bamboo building. The wounds they received, whether from slashing, hacking, or piercing, were all fatal with blood and flesh blurred, a sight too gruesome to bear.
0:15:10|0:15:38|At this moment, a masked performer stood out among the others, breaking free from the surrounding [Imperial Guards], and flew to the top of Mount Xiaolu to overlook the crowd. He spoke loudly, his voice reaching the depths of his dantian, resonating throughout the world. As the sound entered the ears, it was evident of the depth of his skills. Inside the building, [Zhong Yuling] heard the sound and looked up to see the performer, standing tall at eight feet, like a solitary pine tree.
0:15:38|0:15:58|Although his true face was covered by a mask, there was still a world-shaking illusion of extraordinary grace and elegance. The [Imperial Guards] present immediately felt that this person was none other than the current crown prince [Wu Luan]. Acting swiftly to assess the situation and eager to show his superiority, he leaped to the top of the small building. There, the eight-foot-tall opponent, despite being unarmed, showed no signs of weakness.
0:16:1|0:16:13|Several people holding weapons cannot approach him, confirming that he is indeed the Crown Prince. The guards then move in to capture the entertainer in the arena.
0:16:13|0:16:36|Little did they know, the Crown Prince not only had profound martial arts skills, but also unparalleled body awareness. Twisting between the floors, without a weapon in hand, he defeated each of the scattered Feather Forest Guards. The Guards did not dare to delay, leveraging their numerical advantage to force the Crown Prince to the central platform of the bamboo building, where they all attacked him together. The Crown Prince remained fearless, snatching a long knife and engaging in a tangled exchange of moves with the others.
0:16:37|0:16:57|Seizing the opportunity to wield his weapons, [Li Di] forced [Wan Hou] back with awe before leaping into the air. With all his strength, he used his sword as a dagger, thrusting out and directly breaking through the armor of the Feathered Forest Guards, piercing through them. The one who received this blow was on the verge of death at that moment, and all the onlookers were terrified. However, it was a difficult command from the emperor.
0:16:57|0:17:13|The crowd of imperial guards had no choice but to fight against the crown prince. Just as everyone was deadlocked, a figure appeared hidden in the blind spot of the crown prince's vision, attacking from behind and striking a blow to his back. Blood stained the white clothes immediately, the wound so deep that bones and flesh were visible.
0:17:13|0:17:22|The Crown Prince, in pain but not daring to be careless, turned with his sword and struck down the Feather Guards, taking advantage of the moment when the surrounding guards were distracted, he leaped to the top of the bamboo building to avoid the battle.
0:17:22|0:17:41|The crowd of imperial guards approached, following the prince to the top of the bamboo tower. The prince intended to use his younger brother to capture the enemies, but suddenly the bamboo forest on both sides stood tall without any wind, giving a sense of hidden danger. As expected, the guest who kept fish showed respect to the three people and rushed out from the dense bamboo forest, heading straight towards the bamboo tower.
0:17:41|0:18:3|The Crown Prince immediately defended himself upon seeing the situation, but the movement of his back injury hindered his actions. It was this slight hesitation that allowed the two Feather Guards to strike their blades against the Crown Prince's weapon. The tremendous force made it difficult for the Crown Prince to move, and as one of the Feather Guards swung his blade from behind, the Crown Prince, already powerless to resist, could only close his eyes slowly and await the blade.
0:18:3|0:18:7|The long sword swept past in an instant, leaving [Li Di] decapitated.
0:18:7|0:18:26|The powerful swordsmanship of the Imperial Guards caused the prince's head to fly into the air, spinning countless times before finally falling into the river outside the building, oozing blood. The river was clear and intentional, with [Yin Taichang] hiding in it, watching respectfully. It turned out to be the prince's entertainer from earlier, just delaying time for the prince to escape.
0:18:26|0:18:36|At the same time, a woman in a hurry is seen fleeing in the imperial city corridor. She is dressed in luxurious clothing, with a weaving and dyeing workshop in the background. She speaks,
0:18:43|0:18:58|Empress Wan pointed out, the weaver girl stood by her side, hanging the chosen fabric on the wooden frame. The Empress looked up and then dropped the fabric in her hand, speaking to [Qing Nv].
0:20:4|0:20:31|[Li Di] and [Wu Luan] were childhood sweethearts, destined to be together for life. However, due to the late emperor choosing [Wu Luan] as his concubine and later as his empress, their love was never able to come to fruition. Meanwhile, [Qing Nv] harbored a fleeting affection for the crown prince. When these two women meet again, there is a palpable sense of animosity. [Qing Nv] reveals the true feelings between the crown prince and [Wan Hou], while [Wan Hou] admires [Qing Nv]. As the crown prince and [Wan Hou] prepare to meet for their marriage, dreams of returning to the palace haunt them. The empress and the new emperor engage in a forbidden affair, their graceful bodies entwined on the bed.
0:20:31|0:20:50|Firm as if transforming into a demon like restraint, meticulous in creating a good image, revealing tenderness and grace, ambiguous in speech, the new emperor sees his family members in this way, with a playful mood, takes a jade dragon and soaks it in the cabin, waiting for it to be nourished and moistened, then places it on the family members one after another, lightly pushing and gently wiping with a sense of strength and weakness.
0:20:50|0:21:6|The Empress Wan Hou, with an air of laziness, spoke slowly. Inside the light gauze canopy, the new emperor's residence was as peaceful as snow, as she began to speak.
0:21:50|0:22:8|After a pause, the new emperor Li Di whispered in Wan Hou's ear, praising her beautiful jade arms. He then continued with a smile, saying that the colorful clouds were even more enchanting.
0:22:53|0:23:19|The new emperor then pressed the plum jade dragon on the empress's jaw. After this blow, the empress's body softened, turning into a mixture of jade liquid, entwining and stepping onto the other side. The prince [Wu Luan] luckily survived and had already sneaked into the imperial city. He chatted with the late emperor's golden armor, warning about the unguarded intercourse between yin and yang, and closed the empress to the palace bath to cleanse her body. But he found that the interior decoration here was very different from the imperial palace, where the emperor resided in darkness.
0:23:19|0:23:37|Here the candles are lit as bright as daylight, with blue stones piled up, walls built, white jade carvings surrounding the pillars of the bath placed in the main hall. After pouring in the hot spring water and sprinkling flower crowns, the queen retreats her clothes into the pool under the reflection of the candlelight, making the water shimmering. She washes away her exhaustion in the clear spring water.
0:23:37|0:23:54|In the late night, the Crown Prince summoned [Qing Nv] to the sleeping hall to discuss his inner confusion. In the quiet corner of the hall, [Qing Nv] held the candle to illuminate where the Crown Prince was. With fortune and nobility, she slowly spoke as the Crown Prince lay on the strange rock.
0:24:0|0:24:6|The Crown Prince pondered for a moment and asked slowly,
0:24:33|0:24:57|The current emperor's crown prince Ting is unable to control his emotions. His childhood sweetheart and cousin has become his mother after marrying someone else, and now, with the recent passing of the former emperor, his uncle wants to marry his brother's widow and crown her as the empress dowager during the mourning period. Seeing his beloved treated in such a manner, the crown prince is filled with mixed emotions. Just as the scene shifts,...
0:24:57|0:25:4|The scene shifts to the imperial palace, after finishing grooming, [Wan Hou] changes into a light veil with the help of the palace maids and heads towards the bedroom upstairs.
0:25:5|0:25:14|In this place, [Wan Hou] has already changed the candles, lit the incense burner, and quietly waited for the empress to arrive, entering the bedroom and sitting on the cushion.
0:25:14|0:25:35|The empress, with her elbows on the candle holder, her eyes bright from the incense, and her stingy nature, heard a strange noise behind her and quickly called out: [Wan Hou] ran towards [Wu Luan] cheerfully, but was stunned in place by the prince's call of "mother".
0:25:52|0:26:1|Wan Hou, after listening, took a few steps back in restraint and asked softly:
0:26:21|0:26:56|With a burning gaze fixed on [Wan Hou], [Li Di] unexpectedly knelt down and stared at [Wan Hou], solemnly saying: "Listening to [Wu Luan]'s earnest plea." [Wan Hou]'s eyes were misty as she slowly looked at the wealthy man in front of her. As their eyes met, [Wu Luan] asked: "The exchange of glances between the two filled [Wan Hou] with unbearable sorrow and joy." With a flash of light, a pair of jade bi was used to embrace [Wu Luan], and a plan began to take shape.
0:26:58|0:27:2|[Wu Luan] softly called out to [Wan Hou], resting her chin on [Wu Luan]'s forehead, and continued speaking,
0:27:33|0:27:39|In the depths of emotion, [Wan Hou] became more elusive, with lowered eyes, just as she was about to kiss [Wu Luan], she was suddenly pushed away.
0:27:49|0:27:54|Seeing [Wu Luan] so indifferent, [Wan Hou] took advantage of her own chaotic breathing to create some distance between them.
0:27:54|0:28:22|At this moment, as the new emperor's procession was about to report to the queen's daughter in the palace, the new emperor waved his hand to stop them. Wan Hou walked to Wu Luan's side, slapped his shoulder, and her beautiful eyes showed a complex mix of sorrow and cunning, finally bursting into a silly laugh and said:
0:28:26|0:28:40|[Wu Luan] did not know what [Wan Hou] intended, but she went along with it. She stood up, took the bamboo tube off her back, held it in front of her with both hands, and watched as [Wan Hou] pushed open the quiver and held the plain scroll in her hand, smiling as she glanced at [Wu Luan].
0:28:40|0:29:2|Wan Hou's hands swiftly moved the scroll like the wind, then suddenly stopped. With a kick, the delicate figure of Qing Nv emerged from under the blue veil, her embroidered legs dancing as she kicked out the short sword from the scroll and gracefully danced in the air to avoid Wu Luan's bamboo tube. Wan Hou spoke, comparing the short sword to the wings of the Yue Nu sword in front of her, her face turning cold.
0:29:2|0:29:21|Continuing with the drunken close combat, he then recommended [Wu Luan] to come forward. [Wu Luan] used the scroll in his hand to counter [Wan Hou]'s attack. The two moved around the sleeping hall, their steps in perfect harmony, dancing under the Tang family's roof, seemingly weakening everything around them into nothingness. [Wu Luan] then spoke.
0:29:24|0:29:39|Hearing what [Wu Luan] said, [Wan Hou] just nodded slightly, then calmly turned the stab into a chop towards [Wu Luan]'s tool. The two exchanged similar moves in the chase inside the shop, one draped in green gauze, dancing like a fairy phoenix, the other holding gambling chips in the mouth, with a posture like a pine tree.
0:29:39|0:29:56|[Wan Hou] seems to use sword practice as a way to awaken the memories of [Wu Luan]'s past, but [Wan Hou] is sharp and relentless. On the other hand, [Wu Luan] dodges confidently, unwilling to be entangled. Eventually, [Wan Hou] finds a flaw, with a sword pointed at [Wu Luan]'s throat, who then smiles and says.
0:30:2|0:30:17|Having said that, the ropes binding the scroll were picked open, gradually falling down, revealing the blood-stained musician's song in the Wu Yue small building. [Wu Luan] carefully spread it out, only to see the bloodstains and desolation on it, and then heard [Wan Hou] speaking.
0:31:31|0:31:38|Outside the sleeping hall, the new emperor heard the words of the empress, clenched the scepter in his hand, and then bound his hands to his arms before suddenly leaving.
0:31:42|0:32:0|Hearing [Wu Luan] say that [Wan Hou] almost blurted out a word "him", anyone who heard it could feel the contempt and disgust contained in it. Even though in the imperial city, one still needs to be extremely careful. [Wan Hou] ultimately only uttered this word and said no more. Tonight is long, the few people entangled in fate are destined to have a sleepless night.
0:32:0|0:32:17|The Crown Prince is safe, but his relationship with his beloved is ambiguous. The new Emperor Li Di is troubled and indecisive, not returning this year. He is upset and frustrated, feeling alienated from people and things. He gazes at the imperial city with resentment, suddenly realizing that he is constantly thinking about someone who worries about him day and night, calling for his mother Wan Hou.
0:32:17|0:32:27|[Wan Hou] weeps on the jade bi, tears like pearls, the sword pond clear and fresh, cherishing you in my brilliance in the dream. [Qing Nv] foolishly prays for blessings for [Wu Luan] under the moon.
0:32:27|0:32:46|As the Feather Guards who attempted to assassinate the Crown Prince in the early morning rushed back to the imperial city to report, only 9 of the original group remained alive, a result of the performers fighting desperately to protect the unharmed Crown Prince. When they reached a narrow passage, they encountered an eunuch standing on a wooden bridge, blocking their way with an icy demeanor.
0:32:46|0:32:56|The leader of the Imperial Guards, followed by ordering his subordinates to stop the horses, and both sides held a strategy on the bridge, then listened to the eunuch speaking.
0:33:18|0:33:47|Even the good can set up a banquet for the Emperor Zhuque, facing the Emperor's location, bowing to thank the Emperor, the leader pulled out a short knife from his waist, followed by the Linwei who imitated one after another, for a time the weapons competed for fame, the extremely spiritual power only saw the crowd of Yulin Guards pulling the short knife towards the chest armor, cutting off the connecting ropes, taking off the heart-protecting mirror, throwing it into the river, waiting for the subordinates and horses to be like the leader, baring their chests,
0:33:47|0:34:8|The figure transformed into a guardian, holding a short knife in mid-air, paused for a moment before stabbing fiercely between the chest, both the kneeling man and horse did the same, using the short knife to end their own lives. Blood splattered in a circular pattern, revealing nine individuals and one person sitting on a tall horse. With a sword across the chest, blood gushed from between the chest and abdomen, flowing down the mane of the warhorse, seeping onto the bridge surface, and dripping into the water.
0:34:8|0:34:14|Just now, after removing the military forces blocking the bridge, there were also soldiers with long spears buried under the bridge.
0:34:14|0:34:38|The Imperial Guards committed suicide, causing a commotion. The eunuch ordered the troops to rush to the bridge and pour clear spring water on the ground. The guests who were fishing saw that the river water had turned into red blood, flowing towards the distance. Inside the imperial city, the candlelight shone brightly, occasionally allowing sunlight to filter through the dome. In the Tang family residence, despite its grandeur, there was a lack of extravagance and luxury.
0:34:38|0:34:49|In the new imperial mausoleum, Wan Hou was accompanied by civil and military officials. Looking up at the hall, Li Di spoke after a while.
0:35:40|0:35:50|The crowd walked to the hall, where the head was removed to reveal a stone carved screen. If the emperor did not like this snowy mountain, Xuan Bao would immediately send someone to replace it.
0:36:44|0:36:58|Should this snow mountain black panther be bestowed upon Lord Taichang [Pei Hong Thunder], the new emperor asked. As soon as these words were spoken, the courtiers couldn't help but chuckle and cover their mouths to hide their smiles.
0:36:58|0:37:13|Being the son of Taichang, [Yin Jun] glared at [Pei Hong] who was about to draw his sword, but was stopped by Taichang. The new emperor, seeing this, calmly said, "I shall bestow this snow mountain black panther to Taichang."
0:37:26|0:37:41|The carved flying dragon soars in the sky, [Wan Hou] suddenly arrives, speaking loudly, causing the courtiers to look sideways. The new emperor turns his head to look. Seeing the empress approaching the hall, the ministers quickly bow and greet, while [Yin Taichang] speaks loudly, secretly listening to the grand ceremony of His Majesty.
0:37:48|0:38:5|The grand hall was empty, with Wan Hou standing on the bright hall, surrounded by courtiers. Even the palace maids and eunuchs in the field could hear his words, but none dared to speak. The new emperor saw everyone in such a state, so he exchanged glances with the attendants around him, took a grape from the tray they held, and slowly walked towards the prince before speaking.
0:38:17|0:38:40|After a moment of silence, someone among the courtiers hesitantly replied to the new emperor's question about what he had heard. No one dared to speak up, but the powerful minister Gongshan bowed before the empress Wan Hou, while [Pei Hong] remained motionless on the ground. The new emperor entered the hall, his eyes scanning the various courtiers before the angry son finally spoke up.
0:40:1|0:40:16|These words were so powerful that they made the courtiers and the imperial guards stand up straight in their armor. Upon hearing this, the Empress Wan Hou did not hesitate, she knelt down and respectfully said to the Emperor Li Di, "I pay my respects to Your Majesty."
0:40:18|0:40:27|[Pei Hong] laughed heartily at the courtiers.
0:41:8|0:41:22|With a look of reluctance on her face, but also not daring to say more, the Imperial Guards stepped forward to capture [Pei Hong]. However, they saw [Pei Hong] commanding respect and fear in the surroundings, and took off their headgear to glare at [Wu Luan] before following the Imperial Guards away.
0:41:22|0:41:31|Brought to the ceremony by [Pei Hong], the new emperor turned around and helped the empress up, saying, as the empress looked at the screen,
0:41:36|0:41:51|The dragon soars in the sky, Wan Hou and Li Di exchange a smile, then lead the officials to the city tower to watch the execution ground where Pei Hong and others are about to arrive. The city tower is surrounded by four sides, with narrow sand fields below, and the passages are guarded by the Imperial Guards, making it difficult to access the waterside pavilion.
0:41:51|0:42:1|Ten executioners stood in the field, holding torches, with [Pei Hong] among them, while their nine families were stripped of their long robes and bound hand and foot, kneeling on the sand.
0:42:1|0:42:21|But seeing the executioner wielding the cudgel forcefully, he sent the seven-foot tall man Pei Hong flying in the air, the sound of the cudgel cracking the valley incessant. The shattered soul did not fall to the ground, enduring the ordeal in mid-air, with bones and flesh torn apart, abdomen swollen and shattered, fresh blood spraying from his throat, splashing on the sandy ground, dust flying, above the walls of the city in all directions.
0:42:22|0:42:41|When the civil and military officials saw the tragic scene of the guilty, they all actively felt threatened. On both sides of the road, at the edge of the sandy land, the soldiers were in a state of shock and fear when they heard Pei Hong's wailing. [Wan Hou] sat under the Pengge, where the elderly with gray hair in the field were seeking medical treatment with blood-stained bodies, seeming unable to bear to look again.
0:42:41|0:42:49|The new emperor caught a glimpse of [Wan Hou] deep in thought, then glanced at Pei Hong and softly spoke,
0:43:0|0:43:8|The new emperor, with the crown adorned with pearl curtains swaying, just opened his mouth and said.
0:43:10|0:43:30|But [Wan Hou] was seen with lowered brows and eyes, saying, "What the new emperor just said was to ask whether [Wan Hou] would repent. If [Wan Hou] agrees, then the words spoken in the court earlier would be deceiving the emperor. Therefore, [Wan Hou] can only let her brother accompany her to the screen, silently watching the tragic scene without saying a word."
0:43:30|0:43:47|Below, the guards used bamboo sticks to push Pei Hong into the hidden chamber, then another person swung a club, striking Pei Hong's head and causing him to fall to the ground, raising a cloud of dust. After this blow, Pei Hong was unable to move and tragically died under the club.
0:43:59|0:44:7|Does Wan Hou regret this? Hearing his brother's proud question, [Wan Hou] then whispered softly.
0:44:10|0:44:15|Seeing the calm expressions of his family, but with lips and teeth intertwined, [Li Di] smiled on his face and said,
0:44:23|0:44:31|Upon hearing what [Li Di] said, it seemed like they were eager to present a grand gift to him. One of the eunuchs spoke up,
0:44:37|0:45:0|At the time when the blood on the hands of the traitor Fu Zhuchi had not yet dried, [Li Di] took the empress to the horse field to accumulate chariots. The so-called accumulation was a move to show off official status and play games. People played with horses on the sandy field, swinging clubs to hit the ball. The one who first got the ball and passed through the goal was the winner. [Li Di] used this method to make up for his regret of not personally killing Pei Hong. The two sides galloped back and forth, raising dust to the sky.
0:45:0|0:45:11|[Li Di] and the Empress each led their troops, waving long poles, competing for the hollow silver ball. The swift horses were as lively as thunder, the iron-clad chariots raced like the wind, and the convergence of wind and thunder made the scene even more spectacular.
0:45:11|0:45:25|During the exchange, [Li Di] and the Empress Wan Hou were driving side by side. As they approached the silver ball, it rolled between them. The Empress hurriedly reached out to grab it, but was blocked by [Li Di]. Puzzled, the Empress turned to look at [Li Di], and then heard the base say.
0:45:30|0:45:55|The empress was shocked by the words, [Li Di] was relentless, and after speaking, he waved the wooden stick in his hand and fiercely hit the silver ball on the ground, forcing the guards at the ball hole to fall off their horses due to the great force. Then, looking at the winning ball, it bounced back to the starry ground for practice. [Li Di] then swung the stick to knock the silver ball into the hole, and then turned his horse and left.
0:45:55|0:46:0|At the same time, [Yin Jun] glared angrily, faced the screen, and then drew his sword to strike down.
0:46:2|0:46:15|Taichang hurriedly spoke out to stop him, asking Yin Jun who held the sword in mid-air with a trembling voice.
0:46:33|0:46:48|He knew nothing, the daughter of Taichang [Yin Jun]'s sister [Qing Nv] was engaged to the Crown Prince, overseeing the weaving, he was embroidering the queen's attire. When his father arrived, he did not get up to greet him, only saying,
0:47:14|0:47:23|Taichang saw [Qing Nv] but still didn't understand her intentions, and no longer beat around the bush, speaking directly.
0:47:44|0:48:0|[Qing Nv] inserted the sleeve needle into the fabric, looking at the silver phoenix slowly shaking its head. After a while, she said indifferently, tears shimmering in her beautiful eyes. The next night, she went to the royal palace to invite the queen to try on the royal attire.
0:48:22|0:48:45|Qing Nv and the palace maid carefully took off the phoenix robe together, then left the palace. After they walked away, the empress swayed her delicate body gracefully, leaned towards the new emperor and asked. The new emperor pondered for a moment upon hearing her words, then lowered his eyes and replied to the empress.
0:48:58|0:49:20|[Wu Luan] walked to the center of the hall, gradually inspecting the weapons in the hands of the Imperial Guards, confirming their accuracy. She then recommended herself in front of the new Emperor and Empress on the platform, and spoke loudly, "I have heard that Your Highness is a master swordsman, with skills surpassing those of mere youths."
0:49:31|0:49:51|Upon hearing the leader of the Feather Guards speak, the guards raised their swords in front of [Wu Luan]. [Wu Luan] also showed his short weapon on his chest in return. The great hall was dimly lit, with candlelight flickering on the armor, making it feel even colder.
0:49:51|0:50:16|Guests from afar, everyone brandishing their swords, the Imperial Guards attacking relentlessly, paying no heed to those in front of them. The current Emperor's nephew, the former Crown Prince, is fiercely determined, seemingly intent on spilling [Wu Luan]'s blood on the spot. The clash of blades echoes through the hall, with Wan Hou wielding her Yue Maiden short sword, holding her own against two opponents. Even the Empress on the throne remains unfazed, appearing calm with a faint smile on her lips.
0:50:16|0:50:35|Watching Wu Luan single-handedly knock down two Feather Guards, if not for the fact that the weapons in their hands were all made of wood, these two would have already been standing. In the current situation, the Feather Guards surrounded Wu Luan, attacking together to overwhelm her. Facing a dozen Feather Guards alone, [Wu Luan] felt the pressure increase significantly, finding it difficult to defend herself.
0:50:35|0:50:52|[Wu Luan] saw the situation was unfavorable, switched from offense to defense, relied on her unparalleled body skills to move around the hall, engaged with the Lin guards, but facing four opponents with only two fists, [Wu Luan] was powerless to fight back. She had to rely on instinct to wield the short sword in her hand to block the unknown attacks from the heavy feathered armor.
0:50:52|0:51:3|Standing at this moment, [Wu Luan] felt the dissipation of her strength throughout her body. Most likely, her breathing was pulling at her lungs, causing excruciating pain. If this continued, she would surely be defeated and might even perish in the process.
0:51:3|0:51:11|During a moment of confusion for Wu Luan, numerous imperial guards swiftly drew their long swords and passed them under his armpits, lifting Wu Luan into the air where he was unable to move.
0:51:12|0:51:25|Another member of the Imperial Guards fiercely struck [Wu Luan] in the chest with the hilt of his sword, sending her flying off the main hall. In response, [Wan Hou]'s expression immediately changed. The calm and smiling demeanor vanished, replaced by deep concern and worry.
0:51:25|0:51:50|Watching [Wu Luan] in the field again, her steps are not floating, showing no signs of weakness. She launches a strong attack without anger, displaying a strong will to survive. Her body barely withstands the attacks of the heavy Feather Forest Guards. The Guards fail to break through after a long attack, showing signs of impatience. Their coordination is not tight, giving [Wu Luan] a chance to exploit. In a life-threatening confrontation, she once again repels several Guards. Seeing how difficult [Wu Luan] is to deal with, someone among the Guards seeks a gap to challenge her.
0:51:50|0:52:5|Behind a stone pillar in the hall, [Wan Hou] retrieved wooden weapons hidden there in advance and replaced them with steel ones from the armory, waiting for the opportunity to enter the battle. Stepping on his comrades, he leaped into the air with force, wielding his long sword and striking towards [Wu Luan].
0:52:5|0:52:16|[Wu Luan] saw the fierce attack coming, quickly moved a few steps back, raised a defense in front of the forehead, but as the short weapons clashed, the sound of impact lightly carved into his hand, and the arrow in his hand broke with a snap.
0:52:16|0:52:37|Seeing such ignorance, it was clear that today's swordsmanship practice was fake. Uncle's killing of himself seemed real, so I looked angrily at the big shots in the palace, only to see the new brother, who was supposed to be a fake sister, as if everything in the field had not entered his eyes. In a moment of distraction, [Wu Luan] was once again knocked down by a group of Feather Forest Guards, the broken sword in his hand flying away, leaving him defenseless and unable to fight again.
0:52:37|0:52:46|Once again, the Feather Scale Guard wielding a long sword swoops down from the sky, intending to put [Wu Luan] in a life-threatening situation. At this critical moment, [Wan Hou] rises from her seat.
0:52:46|0:53:4|Floating in mid-air, Wan Hou caught the broken sword. The prince knocked the long sword out of the hands of the Feather Guards and Lu Luan, lying on the ground, was unharmed. Wan Hou turned around and looked around at the cold-faced Feather Guards, saying, "0:53:5-0:53:12, the Feather Guards hurriedly bowed and said, 'Your Majesty.' The queen raised her eyes and looked behind her, only to see the new emperor entering the hall.
0:53:13|0:53:19|Approaching [Wan Hou], she softly spoke.
0:53:42|0:53:59|When the Empress saw [Wu Luan] walking away, Wan Hou suddenly drew her sword and turned around, thrusting the sword into the throat of the Yulin Guard who had dropped the precious garment on the ground. The sudden killing, whether out of anger for disrupting the swordplay performance or for failing to kill [Wu Luan], was a mystery.
0:54:0|0:54:9|On the other side, the Empress went to the Crown Prince's sleeping quarters to comb his long hair.
0:54:17|0:54:25|Feeling the delicate jade fingers of [Wan Hou], [Wu Luan] softly replied.
0:54:52|0:55:8|Dipping his hands into the pool to wash away the guilt, he then gently touches the neck of [Wan Hou], turning her delicate body towards him, leaning in close and asking, as [Wu Luan] looks up and responds to [Wan Hou].
0:56:6|0:56:23|[Wan Hou] finished speaking, threw the plain mask onto [Wu Luan]'s chest, and then dragged her skirt away from the prince's bedroom in a huff, returning to silence. The moonlight washed over, enveloping Wu Luan in the courtyard, adding to the loneliness. He covered the mask on his face, seemingly unwilling to admit what Wan Hou had just said.
0:56:23|0:56:50|At this moment, a piece of silk floated down from the sky, [Wu Luan] reached out and grabbed it. Upon closer inspection, there were patterns on it, so she slowly unfolded it. Sure enough, on the plain silk were two figurines, one with a majestic appearance, dressed in imperial robes with dragon patterns, resembling an emperor, but with blood on the back of the head. Looking at the side, the other figure had a sinister and outstanding assassin appearance.
0:56:51|0:57:6|[Wu Luan] watched as the hand holding the scroll trembled uncontrollably, the long night slowly passed, and the next day in the early capital market, whether the imperial court was placed in a foreign country, all clans traded here.
0:57:6|0:57:22|In the midst of chaos, a figure in white robes shuttles through the crowd, walking across a hidden barrier to avoid detection, heading towards a dark and dimly lit small building under the city wall. Upon entering, they see a person sitting on the wooden platform of the second floor. Seeing someone approaching, the person speaks.
0:57:33|0:57:39|After [Wu Luan] caught it, she held it in front of her eyes to examine it closely, intending to sniff it with her nose, but then she heard the person say:
0:58:27|0:58:42|Continuing to mutter incessantly even after returning to the palace.
0:58:48|0:59:5|I heard the Empress Dowager say that, [Wu Luan] looked at [Qing Nv] upon hearing the words, as if there was reproach in the tomb. [Qing Nv] panicked and quickly lowered her eyes, not daring to meet the gaze of her beloved. The palace was not lit by candles, only the moonlight washed over, making the silent moment even colder.
0:59:5|0:59:26|Qing Nv took the scroll inscribed with the Yue people's song from Wu Luan's hand and pushed it open, softly reciting.
1:0:20|1:0:41|Wu Luan, while pulling at the clothes of Wan Hou in the spacious hall, chased after Qing Nv, who was also tearing off his already thin clothes, revealing the delicate jade body to Wu Luan, his eyes filled with confusion and the fiery gaze, forcibly pulling Qing Nv into his arms, feeling the teasing sensation of their skins rubbing against each other.
1:0:43|1:1:0|[Qing Nv] trembling and helpless cries, along with the dripping wet Feifei prostitute through the skylight, holding a person as warm as jade, [Wu Luan]'s unbearable decoration, took away [Qing Nv] on the cold floor, never expecting to lose something in this way.
1:1:0|1:1:17|The dense rain flowed along the eaves, turning into a water curtain that quietly concealed the bustling crowd inside the shop. Under the skywell, Jin Nv cradled the naked [Wu Luan], like a mother caressing a playful child, water droplets lingering on the two figures, outlining the softness and firmness just now.
1:1:26|1:1:44|One morning, the rare light of the sky shone, with continuous mountains in the outskirts of the city, stretching for thousands of miles. Inside the city, clouds and mist lingered, making it difficult to distinguish between yin and yang. The imperial city towered high, connecting with the sky, dominating the clouds and mist. The rivers and lakes lined up outside the palace walls, with lush vegetation surpassing that of the mountains and forests. The power and influence of the imperial court and its officials were immeasurable.
1:1:44|1:2:14|The resounding voice of the Sui Dynasty's interior decoration spread, and the grand ceremony of the enthronement of [Wan Hou] was just beginning. In the middle of the imperial city's corridor, black-armored imperial guards split to the left and right, guarding the empress on her journey without incident. Ahead, there were those who skillfully wielded the reins of spirited horses, leading the procession with awe-inspiring grace. Following the sound of the Five Sacred Mountains, they slowly made their way to the court where the new emperor resided. Behind them, there were others carrying golden ceremonial instruments, proceeding smoothly. Six tall horses with towering heads and bodies clad in golden armor were led by dedicated individuals.
1:2:14|1:2:29|Driving the carriage of [Wan Hou] slowly forward, the carriage was seen to be over ten feet long, entirely made of purple sandalwood. Under the seat was pure gold cloud patterns, providing enough space for [Wan Hou] and other commoners to sit comfortably.
1:2:29|1:2:39|Looking up, the canopy on top is made of pure gold, shining brightly even under rare sunlight, exuding richness and splendor. Silk curtains hang down, displaying utmost luxury and extravagance.
1:2:40|1:2:50|[Wan Hou] is now dressed in a phoenix robe made of crimson silk, sitting in the carriage of the phoenix, passing through the corridor and placed in the main hall. All civil and military officials and ceremonial guards are performing their duties.
1:2:50|1:3:23|As for the Feathered Guards, eunuchs, and princesses, they all split up and lined the sides of the road to welcome [Wan Hou]. She was adorned in the brilliance of Royalty, with swaying arm movements and a dazzling aura. Wearing golden and jade ornaments with pearls adorning her hair, it was evident that her makeup for today's enthronement was different, exceptionally glamorous. As she approached the new Emperor, a eunuch presented a rare treasure to [Wan Hou], which the new Emperor personally opened to reveal a jade seal engraved with the characters "Joy of Wan Hou".
1:3:24|1:3:34|[Wan Hou] smiled and summoned the palace maids to collect the imperial seal. Then, hand in hand with the new emperor, she graciously greeted the courtiers.
1:3:48|1:4:18|The Imperial Guards, a strategy of the new emperor, were summoned by the internal supervisor. They appeared in the rainforest robes on both sides of the Great Hall, clanging their armor as they walked to the center. In front of the new emperor and [Wan Hou], they bowed and showed respect. The arena was split, with only the crown prince coming forward. After a while, [Wu Luan] was nowhere to be seen. The eunuch anxiously looked at [Wu Luan], whose gaze was extremely cold. Just then, the crown prince appeared wearing a mask, holding a stool in front of him.
1:4:18|1:4:39|Walking slowly to the stage, bowing respectfully, a black-clothed masked figure leaped out from behind, crouching in front of the prince, speaking for [Wu Luan]. With hands clasped to the chest, he spoke to the officials in the field.
1:4:41|1:4:47|Wan Hou then somersaulted in the air a few times and said to the Feather Guards on both sides of the arena.
1:4:49|1:5:5|After pushing all the Feather Guards off the stage, leaving only himself and [Wu Luan], he walked up to the stage with [Wu Luan], lit the candles around her, led the people away from [Wu Luan], and with a drumstick pointed at the person in the black robe, the performance began.
1:5:12|1:5:37|The sound of drums is heard, a sword is drawn, and a handsome man enters the stage with a drunken demeanor, dancing upon seeing this. Then a person in black stands on the stage upside down, pretending to be a palace wall. [The handsome man] leans against the person in black and dances along with the drumbeat, spinning around. The scene is so vivid that it's hard to distinguish between east and west, then he lies down next to the person in black and falls into a deep sleep.
1:5:37|1:5:55|At this moment, the man in white suggested lifting the hem of his pants and walking slowly on the stage, looking around with his companions, and quietly approaching the torture device where [Li Di] was. [Wu Luan] sat in the hall, watching this action with a pensive look, and saw the man in white slowly moving forward with the sound of drums.
1:5:55|1:6:1|Huddled near [Wan Hou] on the carpet, feeling around, thus interacting with [Wan Hou]'s ankle.
1:6:1|1:6:22|Both of them trembled, [Wan Hou] stood up in surprise, while the man in white acted like a startled bird. The empress's eyes were cold and stern, showing her relationship with the court. [Wu Luan]'s intentions were clear, so [Yin Taichang] remained silent and observed quietly. Despite the commotion between the two, they did not notice each other's presence due to the dim moonlight.
1:6:22|1:6:39|The two were only inches apart, yet they remained strangers to each other. After [Huawei Man] probed for a while and found nothing of interest, he became angry and brushed his sleeves, causing the man in white to hurriedly avoid it and stumble to the ground. He got up in a sorry state only to realize that [Huawei Man] had already fallen asleep on the ground.
1:6:39|1:7:4|The empress in the palace saw this, as if all memories were difficult to calm, her heart seemed to want to protect the fairy placed on the phoenix robe, sometimes tightly grasping, sometimes trembling, completely immersed in it. Suddenly hearing the drumming, she saw a man in white clothes flipping around on the stage and circling behind [Wan Hou], slowly reaching out his right hand, as if about to strike at [Wan Hou]'s neck, but then hesitated as if having some concerns.
1:7:4|1:7:15|Avoiding the body, Wan Hou took out a screen and a goose feather from her arms. The new emperor in the palace was indifferent, without any brilliance. Then a cold smile appeared, even the pearl curtain above her head trembled slightly.
1:7:15|1:7:29|In the scene, the white-robed man is seen using a feather to open the bottle, then pouring white powder from the bottle onto the feather. The new emperor, seeing how skilled he is compared to his father, lightly taps his fingers to the sound of the music with an indifferent expression.
1:7:30|1:7:41|Shortly after, the drumbeats grew darker, and a man in white placed a goose feather near the ear of a man in a colorful robe, then gently blew some powder, causing it to slowly drift towards the man's ear.
1:7:41|1:8:5|At this moment, the new emperor saw a pair of golden fake weights in front of him, which was an old item of the late emperor. The iron-faced eyes seemed to still have traces of blood at the corners. When the new emperor came to his senses, he saw a man lying on the ground in the field, motionless. Witnessing this, the new emperor found it difficult to calmly look at the extremely stern face of the man in the field.
1:8:5|1:8:29|It seems that the play touches on the deep secrets of her heart. Thinking of this, the late emperor stayed on the iron surface, with a trickle of red blood flowing from the corner of his eye endlessly. The new emperor's strategy, [Wan Hou], seeing the play like this, once again fell into memories. The scene of the late emperor's death on that day is vividly remembered, just like the play being performed in front of her. As a result, her expression collapsed, her delicate body trembling uncontrollably.
1:8:29|1:8:55|Adorned with a golden hairpin and dangling earrings that swayed with her every breath, the court officials and military officers all appeared pensive, yet no one dared to speak. The court fell into silence, and after the audience, the new emperor finally regained his composure and pretended to be calm. He glanced at [Li Di] who was performing on stage, then put on a smile and walked towards the imperial seat. [Li Di] also stood up and accompanied the emperor.
1:8:55|1:9:22|The two walked slowly in the hall and entered the stage where the new emperor was dressed in luxurious attire. He then slowly raised his hands, lightly clapped his palms, and then turned to the civil and military officials below the stage, applauding. The officials followed suit, and the applause in the hall thundered, dispelling the previous coldness. However, Taichang had a plan in mind and remained unmoved, watching coldly from the side.
1:9:22|1:9:42|During this interval, the actors on stage took the opportunity to excuse themselves and disappeared into the crowd. [Wu Luan] saw this and got up to leave as well, but the mask of a performer still adorned his face, never removed. After the officials applauded and the new emperor turned to walk towards [Wu Luan], he spoke.
1:9:50|1:10:4|Upon hearing the words of the new emperor, the crown prince [Wu Luan] took off his mask, revealing his eyes devoid of spirit, tears and sweat, as if completely immersed in the play and unable to extricate himself. Seeing this, the new emperor took a step forward and spoke.
1:11:15|1:11:23|Yin Taichang slowly retreated back into the ranks of courtiers, while Li Di turned to look at the empress and then faced the courtiers.
1:11:39|1:11:46|Upon hearing the resolute words from the Empress, the new Emperor's assistant, [Wu Luan], slowly approached with a puzzled expression, staring at him coldly and questioning him.
1:12:2|1:12:11|The Empress Dowager suddenly realized her previous loss of composure, hurriedly lowered her eyes, gathered her thoughts, and then listened to the new prince Chen Sheng's question.
1:12:50|1:13:8|Accompanying the Crown Prince on his journey, the new emperor briefly mentioned in the court that [Wu Luan] would be sent as a hostage to the cold land of the Khitans. It was disguised as a noble mission, but in reality, it was to eliminate her thoughts of revenge and to safeguard the imperial power.
1:13:8|1:13:30|The empress, without desire, walked slowly to [Wu Luan]'s side, reaching out to smooth the wrinkles on his clothes. Tears welled up in her eyes, but she forced herself to remain calm and managed a faint, sorrowful smile as she softly said, "Wu Luan, your heart will break when we meet again."
1:13:32|1:13:50|As he was about to leave, he heard a girl in the shop blocking his way. [Wu Luan] followed the sound and saw [Qing Nv] walking towards the stage among the courtiers' gazes. When she reached the stage, [Qing Nv] respectfully bowed to the new emperor and empress, and then spoke.
1:14:5|1:14:17|Qing Nv, innocent and outspoken, did not expect the empress's anger to burn inside. With a chilling smile on the surface, she looked at Qing Nv and coldly said, "..."
1:14:30|1:14:39|[Wu Luan] blurted out upon hearing Empress Wan Hou's words, not hiding her complaints about [Qing Nv] kneeling on the ground and appearing disrespectful, and she couldn't understand why the Empress was so angry.
1:14:39|1:14:51|This is the end of the story. The emperor's words are like gold and jade, and the princess [Wu Luan] is to accompany the Imperial Guards to the Khitan. [Wu Luan] knows full well the purpose of the new emperor's arrangement, but he is completely indifferent.
1:14:51|1:15:9|The city of Meng is filled with gloom and favoritism, being here only adds to the pain. It's better to leave and find peace. However, it's a pity that [Qing Nv], who has not yet married, revealed her feelings in front of the Empress and the courtiers, only to be punished by the new Emperor for his jealousy and the Empress's resentment.
1:15:9|1:15:32|At this moment, [Yin Taichang] was kneeling down, looking at the bloody scar on his daughter's back, while applying Jiang's wound medicine on his hands.
1:15:41|1:15:50|At this moment, a eunuch shouted loudly, making [Yin Taichang] flustered. He hurriedly went to the tomb and shed tears as he respectfully welcomed the queen to move her carriage outside the Taichang Mansion.
1:15:52|1:16:15|Leading everyone into the palace, Wan Hou quickly walked to the Taichang Mansion, where they were forbidden to approach Qing Nv. Reaching out and brushing past the window on her back without any mercy, Qing Nv endured in silence. The Empress then spoke up and asked.
1:16:38|1:16:59|Seeing [Qing Nv] not responding to him, the Empress pressed [Qing Nv]'s face against hers, turning his face towards herself, with a cold smile on her face as she asked.
1:17:34|1:17:51|After speaking, Wan Hou smiled and turned to leave, kneeling before Taichang. A hint of pleasure flashed discreetly across the Empress's face.
1:17:52|1:18:0|The scene shifts to the vast snowy plain, where [Wu Luan] speaks up to inquire the accompanying Imperial Guards.
1:18:23|1:18:44|After finishing speaking with Lin Wei, Wan Hou continued to lead the way, while the Crown Prince, feeling a sense of melancholy, noticed the disrespectful behavior of the Imperial Guards beside him. Showing his displeasure, he had no choice but to continue on towards the Khitan border with the new emperor in power. When they reached the snowy plains, everyone took a short rest.
1:18:44|1:18:59|Wu Luan looked around and happened to see a team dressed in a very similar way to their own, walking ahead on the snowy road. Perplexed, Wu Luan turned around and asked the leader of the Imperial Guards about it.
1:19:15|1:19:23|Hearing what the Crown Prince said, the guards including Yu and Lin drew their long swords from their waists and threw down the weapons in their hands. The Crown Prince, with a cold and stern gaze, spoke.
1:19:33|1:20:0|During the conversation of the Imperial Guards, [Wu Luan] secretly pulled out a dagger from under the horse, preparing to fight to the death. The leader seemed to have sensed something, immediately swinging his long knife towards [Wu Luan]. Just then, a sound of a throat being cut was heard from the ground, followed by splattering blood. A person leaped from the snow behind, wielding a long knife and splitting the chest of the leader of the Imperial Guards. Blood splattered on the spot, the body turned cold, while the warm sun shone nearby.
1:20:0|1:20:30|Upon this sudden turn of events, before the guards of the Imperial Feather Guards could react, numerous soldiers in white robes leaped out from the snowy ground, surrounding the guards with powerful crossbows in hand. Swords were drawn and arrows were shot without mercy, piercing through the hearts of the guards, leaving them no chance to fight back. As the white-robed soldiers collected the spoils and regrouped, [Wu Luan] finally opened his eyes, only to see the bodies of the guards lying around him in the snow, all dressed in black robes. At that moment, lying in the blood-soaked snow, the scene was incredibly vivid.
1:20:30|1:20:36|The leader in white robes spoke again.
1:20:38|1:20:50|The man in white lifts the muscles on his face, revealing himself to be the son of the current Taichang [Yin Jun]. Acting on his father's secret order, he leads elite troops to ambush at the border between Youzhou and the Khitan, rescuing [Wu Luan] from the hands of the Imperial Guards.
1:20:50|1:21:15|The bloodstains cleaned by the crowd sat on the lion-shaped wooden raft, galloping on the snowy plain pulled by a spirited horse. [Wu Luan] and [Yin Jun] sat together, but they looked at each other in silence. [Yin Jun] remained calm and never smiled, while [Wu Luan] was full of doubts but found it hard to ask. After hesitating for a while, she finally struggled to speak and asked.
1:21:25|1:21:31|Prince Wen [Yin Jun] listened to him for a long time, feeling guilty in his heart, and sat down on the Mu Hua to avoid his gaze.
1:21:37|1:21:57|After a brief response from [Yin Jun], he fell silent. [Wu Luan] also remained quiet for a moment. As the group moved forward, they entered deeper into the distant mountains and forests. [Yin Jun]'s men lit a bonfire, burning all the unknown corpses and clothing from the rainforest. Seeing the flames rising, [Wu Luan] spoke again.
1:23:2|1:23:15|[Yin Jun], with fluctuating emotions, after questioning [Wu Luan], unexpectedly drew his sword and placed it at [Wu Luan]'s neck, glaring angrily. Hearing [Yin Jun]'s remarks, [Wu Luan] seemed to be moved as well, allowing him to act offensively without saying a word.
1:23:15|1:23:30|The scene shifts to the imperial palace in the capital city, where [Yin Taichang] brings the chess pieces to attack the military governor Yin Jun. Seeing his brother holding the blood-stained mask of the mysterious performer, both father and son are extremely nervous.
1:23:31|1:23:41|After an unknown period of time, the new emperor finally spoke, following the mask.
1:23:54|1:24:0|You are probably the one talking to someone else.
1:25:8|1:25:14|Upon hearing the eunuch's words, the new emperor took a deep breath, gazing into the void. After a long while, he sighed and said, "..."
1:25:38|1:25:44|The scene shifts to the mansion of the Taichang family. After the Taichang has paid respects to his ancestors, he turns and walks towards [Yin Jun], saying,
1:26:24|1:26:41|Where [Qing Nv] was heading was the boudoir of [Qing Nv], and [Yin Jun] was walking on it. Faintly hearing [Qing Nv] singing, he stopped in his tracks. [Qing Nv] turned around with a smile, playfully placing a performer's mask in front of her eyes. [Qing Nv] seemed to not believe that [Wu Luan] was already dead, and slowly said.
1:26:55|1:27:2|Seeing Wan Hou lightly brushing her hand, the mask immersed in a dream, talking to herself.
1:27:3|1:27:36|Seeing the gradually thinning figure of the younger sister, [Yin Jun] felt heartbroken for a long time. Slowly approaching, he stood behind her, embraced her in his arms, and comforted her. Upon hearing the resolute words from the younger sister, [Yin Jun] felt extremely distressed. With a surge of emotions, he tightened his embrace and then poured out his heart,
1:27:42|1:27:56|Upon hearing him say so in her ear, [Qing Nv] was graceful, with her eyes sparkling and a slight chill. Her chin lifted with a subtle smile, and with this smile, her rosy cheeks and the downward curve seemed to shimmer with radiance.
1:27:56|1:28:9|Watching him tie his hands and gently press the spiritual mask against his chest, caressing the patterns on it, as if embracing [Wu Luan] after the rain, feeling the remaining tenderness.
1:28:9|1:28:32|At the same time, [Qing Nv] hesitated repeatedly as the person she was concerned about rode a white horse on the snowy plain, but eventually galloped towards the mountains. The imperial city was shrouded in mysterious clouds, while the market was bustling as usual. A figure in black robes moved through the crowd, heading towards a dark building under the city wall. When the gentle breeze blew, it revealed that under the veil was the current empress.
1:28:32|1:28:55|In the building, [Wan Hou] played with the screen in her hand, then spoke and asked, [Wan Hou] suddenly turned her head to look at the person, and then said, hearing what the pharmacist said,
1:28:57|1:29:14|Under the veil, [Wan Hou]'s pretty face appeared even colder. She took out a paper package from her bosom and then walked to the pharmacist's side, squatting down. Gently and tenderly, she lifted the pharmacist's hand and handed over the paper package. With a pair of innocent eyes, she looked at him and then said,
1:29:27|1:29:45|The emperor did not hesitate to reveal the subtle hints in his words. After giving the imperial decree, he quickly handed a paper package containing arsenic to the pharmacist, knowing that there were countless attendants and guards around [Wan Hou], and the pharmacist was alone. After dealing with this matter, [Wan Hou] did not leave.
1:29:45|1:30:4|Sitting quietly in the small building. Waiting for a while, a person walked on the road towards the small building. Observing respectfully, it was indeed the military governor of Youzhou, Yin Sun, who walked to Wan Hou and then knelt down to report to Wan Hou. Seeing this, Wan Hou knew that Wu Luan was safe.
1:30:4|1:30:13|The filial daughter of sin left, returned to the palace, and saw her little table clothes, exposing the jade seal of the countryside, in a panic in the hall. It seems that there is a plan.
1:30:13|1:30:39|Upon hearing the call from inside, [Wan Hou] hurriedly left the Tang residence in disarray, collapsing on the bed in a state of disarray. The maids in the shop also dressed in fine clothes and respectfully welcomed the emperor's arrival. The new emperor dismounted and walked up the steps, leaving the maids behind. Mistakenly, he went towards where [Wan Hou] had collapsed, and used a cue stick to push aside the killing cane.
1:30:39|1:30:51|Wan Hou's breath was ethereal, her long hair cascading over the imperial seal, outlining her graceful figure. The new emperor, puzzled by her demeanor, then asked.
1:31:18|1:31:39|Hearing what [Wan Hou] said, and seeing her winding through the light gauze, wearing few clothes, the new emperor waved his hand to dismiss the eunuchs and walked to [Wan Hou]'s bed, sat down and continued, following the new emperor's intention, [Wan Hou] sent to the suburbs of Ruhuai, while applying makeup, a red thread tied around her jade spine, complementing each other, making her look even more delicate.
1:31:39|1:31:48|The new emperor, with a baby in his arms, was spoken to by [Wan Hou].
1:32:28|1:32:46|Without paying attention to the words being passed on, hot tears lingered on the cheeks of [Wan Hou], then heard her say she felt the warmth of the new emperor's palm, pausing slightly on her back, [Wan Hou] then continued to speak.
1:33:2|1:33:8|The new emperor lowered his head and looked at the charming figure in his arms. [Wan Hou] then withdrew from his embrace, and they gazed into each other's eyes for a long time before speaking.
1:33:28|1:33:42|Upon hearing the words of the new emperor, [Wan Hou] seemed to be moved. She nurtured the Mingye Tomb with tears brimming, then rushed into the arms of the new emperor, a pair of jade hairpins intertwined behind her head, tears flowing freely without constraint.
1:33:42|1:33:51|Before becoming the empress, she was just a child longing for love, imprisoned by the late emperor without receiving his affection.
1:33:51|1:34:17|[Wu Luan], childhood friend of his, never took a step for him, but the person in front of him poisoned the former emperor, even slaughtered the courtiers, just to make herself the empress, perhaps at this moment [Wan Hou] vaguely felt the new emperor's strong love for him, so she let him be so reckless on her body for the last time. He listened to what [Yin Jun] said, and [Yin Taichang] continued to ask in front of the dressing mirror.
1:34:17|1:34:35|[Wan Hou] said that since the moment the Crown Prince was forced to be a hostage, he had made up his mind. Even though the Emperor was suspicious, with all the favor he received,
1:34:59|1:35:6|He publicly announced the crime of the Emperor's senior brother usurping the throne. He did this to uphold justice for the late Emperor.
1:35:14|1:35:26|Yin Jun's words once again confirmed Yin Taichang's shock. However, in addition to his surprise, he had already walked to the snow leopard screen given by the new emperor and leaned against it, feeling emotional.
1:35:50|1:36:10|Yin Taichang finished speaking, his mind filled with countless thoughts. His strategies in the tomb were profound, as he paced back and forth in the hall, then continued speaking.
1:36:25|1:36:59|Yin Taichang greeted his son's surprised gaze and asked, the two of them facing each other, their eyes becoming more resolute. Yin Jun firmly held his deputy leader's arm for support, and decisively spoke. After that, he walked with his father to the secret chamber in the mansion. Yin Jun sat on the couch holding a dagger, and his father took out a black box from a hidden place, containing a dark liquid resembling ink.
1:36:59|1:37:14|With his father's approval, [Yin Jun] placed the blade of the dagger in it, and when it was soaked in poison, black smoke rose up. Only then did he realize that the black liquid in the box contained a deadly poison. To ensure the success of their plan, father and son decided to hide the poisoned dagger and bring it to the banquet, prepared for any eventuality.
1:37:14|1:37:33|At the same time, Wan Hou was also preparing, dressed in a delicate red phoenix robe in front of the dressing table, looking like a recovered fire, wrapping herself up gracefully. She no longer had the innocent appearance of the past, sitting in front of the bronze mirror, adjusting the pure paper, making the red makeup perfect, even more dazzling than on the day of her enthronement.
1:37:33|1:37:52|Now in the mirror of the empress dowager's tomb, Wan Hou's smile is no longer gentle as before, but rather cold and chilling. After a while, she is seen inserting a long needle into the screen, taking out some poisonous powder and carefully placing it on the inside of her fingernail. After preparing everything, she gazes at the mirror for a long time before speaking in a stern voice, Li Di said,
1:38:39|1:38:50|The new emperor spoke eloquently, saying that after this there would be eunuchs, who recorded his words on the scroll of vengeance. The new emperor's intentions were clear, but his mind was preoccupied with important matters, smiling unknowingly at that moment.
1:38:50|1:39:7|[Wu Luan] led a white horse through the mountains, gazing at the imperial capital in the distance. As various forces stirred in the shadows, the night banquet began. Eunuchs and palace maids moved about the court, preparing delicious food and fine wine, holding up bright lanterns. Civil and military officials gradually joined the feast.
1:39:7|1:39:13|There are imperial guards from the palace coming, disarming them to ensure the safety of the emperor.
1:39:13|1:39:39|[Yin Jun], as a military officer, casually accepted the jade token from General [Yin Jun] and handed over his waist accessories to the interior decorator for safekeeping. Only then was [Yin Jun] allowed to enter the court for the night banquet. Even though all the officials were dressed in formal attire, they walked into the court. After the officials entered the banquet, they could be seen walking around the court, along the corridor.
1:39:39|1:40:6|With the Forbidden Army secretly guarding, the new emperor was about to eliminate the Yin Taichang lineage from the court during the night banquet. To ensure nothing went wrong, the court was brightly lit up unlike its usual gloomy appearance. The officials took their seats, dividing the court into left and right. Musicians and dancers slowly made their way into the hall, their performance spanning inside and outside the court, showcasing the grandeur of the night banquet. The musicians and dancers each performed their duties.
1:40:6|1:40:35|In front of the hall, the officials bowed to the new emperor, and as they did, the musical instruments played, creating a lively atmosphere like a night banquet. The new emperor and the empress sat on the throne, with a palace maid holding a golden silk peacock feather umbrella behind [Li Di], symbolizing the solemnity. Behind the umbrella, there was a golden screen carved with dragons and phoenixes surrounded by auspicious clouds.
1:40:35|1:40:52|It was on that day when the new emperor accepted the dragon and phoenix screen from the empress, indicating the new emperor's deep love for the empress without a doubt. It was known that the late emperor, during his reign, placed the snow mountain black panther jade screen here to remind the successor to be patient and restrained in order to seek the world.
1:40:52|1:41:18|Now that the country is easy to defend, the Empress Dowager is once again in harmony with her younger brother, comparing themselves to a dragon and phoenix. They are enjoying themselves under this magnificent screen, toasting and exchanging cups. I wonder what the late emperor would feel if he knew. When the officials and ministers see [Li Di] like this, they also relax, smile happily, some chatting freely with each other, some dancing and singing, fully indulging in the joy of the court, presenting a harmonious scene of unity between the ruler and his subjects.
1:41:18|1:41:45|In the midst of this flourishing era, unbeknownst to many, hidden currents were already stirring beneath the surface. Among the civil and military officials, only [Yin Taichang] and his son [Yin Jun] refrained from practicing music and dance, indulging in fine wine. They cautiously observed the movements of the empress in the court, while at this moment, the court dancers gathered together, their graceful figures swaying in front of the empress and the officials, immediately capturing everyone's attention and leading the courtiers into a state of bliss.
1:41:45|1:41:53|The empress Wan Hou secretly put a gold cup into her bosom, sprinkled it with a deadly powder, and then pretended to chat and laugh with the new emperor Li Di beside her, causing him to relax his guard.
1:41:53|1:42:7|His Highness Taichang, [Yin Jun], with sharp eyes like torches, noticed the Empress's intentions. He realized that the golden goblet contained a deadly poison. Although his expression remained unchanged, he quietly observed the situation as the Empress proceeded to drink from the goblet.
1:42:15|1:42:32|Hearing the Empress's words, Wan Hou gestured in the great hall, dismissing the musicians and dancers. She then instructed the eunuch to bring a wine jug to the Empress, who raised a golden goblet in a toast. As she tapped the chopping board, the Empress spoke out loud.
1:42:53|1:43:1|The queen then received the golden statue from the new emperor, knelt down before him, was helped up by the new emperor, and whispered something mysterious in his ear.
1:43:6|1:43:22|With this blow, the new emperor, [Li Di], smiled with joy and anticipation. Taking the golden cup from [Wan Hou], he held it in front of him and spoke.
1:43:28|1:43:34|All raised their cups in unison, with both civil and military officials responding. At that moment, from the emperor and empress dowager to the courtiers, all showed joyful expressions.
1:43:34|1:44:2|The new emperor smiled as he gazed at the splendid scene for a long time, about to eavesdrop while dining. A female voice was heard in the restaurant, a young girl [Qing Nv] was performing songs and dances for the emperor and empress in the county town. Following the sound, the new emperor saw [Qing Nv] dressed in white leading a group of performers on stage to bow to the emperor and empress. The new emperor temporarily refrained from drinking, and turned to [Yin Taichang] to ask, and Taichang praised.
1:44:40|1:44:46|Seeing [Qing Nv] and [Wan Hou] blending together, the Empress showed no emotion in her eyes, while the new Emperor couldn't help but sigh with emotion.
1:45:12|1:45:31|Seeing the new emperor decisive, the empress couldn't help but show a consistent expression. The eunuch who saw the situation took the golden cup from the new emperor's hand and gave it to [Qing Nv] on the platform to thank the imperial concubine [Qing Nv]. [Qing Nv] doesn't drink, the imperial intention cannot be violated. Hearing this, the eunuch said so, and [Qing Nv] took the golden cup and spoke.
1:45:41|1:46:3|Taking it as a rebuke for her own decision, Wan Hou smiled and sipped from the golden goblet. As the cup was returned to its place, Yin Jun, seated as a guest, could only watch as she drank the poisoned wine. Qing Nv, unaware of her own fate, would later don the mask once worn by the prince after departing from the mortal world. Then, the emperor and empress took their seats.
1:46:7|1:46:14|Unnoticed by everyone present, behind [Qing Nv], there was a spiritual person with eyes that were particularly intense beneath the mask.
1:47:32|1:47:37|Not to mention at this moment, [Qing Nv] led several beautiful women to dance and sing on the stage to commemorate the deceased son of the former emperor.
1:48:26|1:48:52|Wan Hou gazed at the electric puppet in silence, her eyes shimmering. It was unclear whether she was grieving for Qing Nv's death or angry about the exposure of the plan. In the scene, the performer laid Qing Nv on the stage and anxiously revealed her true face by removing the mask, revealing Wu Luan who had died and come back to life. The new emperor couldn't believe his eyes.
1:49:2|1:49:14|Seeing [Wan Hou] struggling in front of him, wanting to say something, but coughing up blood that flowed into his ear along his cheek, it took a while before he recovered and smiled with tears.
1:49:28|1:49:56|Upon hearing [Wu Luan] sobbing and speaking in such a manner, [Qing Nv] finally satisfied, with her strength depleted, quietly lay in [Wu Luan]'s arms as a guest, [Yin Jun] could not bear it any longer, pushed away the precious jade plate in front of him, and was overwhelmed by the divine rush onto the stage.
1:49:56|1:50:24|Kneeling before the body of [Qing Nv], [Yin Jun] seemed unable to believe it, watching the blood flowing from his younger sister without daring to move. After a while, he pushed [Wu Luan] away as if going mad, and pulled [Qing Nv] into his arms. Losing his voice, he saw his younger sister dying from poison. [Yin Taichang], also overwhelmed with sorrow, only trembled while holding onto Changfu. Witnessing this tragic scene, the civil and military officials in the court knew that there was poison in the wine, but at this moment, no one dared to speak up.
1:50:24|1:50:44|In the court, as the new shoots emerge, holding the little sister in his arms and speaking softly, when the depth of the Kokoxili is a bit deep, on the stage [Yin Jun] has already lost his mind, completely ignoring the empress in the palace, indulging in the pain of losing the little sister, the new emperor sits on the dragon throne, quietly observing the situation in the palace.
1:50:44|1:50:53|Although Wan Hou appeared desolate, tears welled up in her eyes. She turned slowly like a dying person and looked at the Empress Dowager standing by her side.
1:50:53|1:51:9|The woman who should have been the mother of the world, at this moment, tears stained her makeup and fell down, trembling along with the queen's body. The new emperor was greatly shocked, knowing the truth in his heart, but still hesitated to speak and asked the queen.
1:51:14|1:51:35|The queen Wan Hou raised her gentle voice, not meeting the eyes of the new emperor Li Di. She stubbornly replied that even the queen herself did not want to see her. The new emperor slowly stood up, half kneeling in front of her, trembling as he reached out his hands to hold the queen's cheeks. Although the action was simple, it seemed to drain all the strength from the new emperor's body. As he forced the queen to look at him.
1:51:35|1:51:40|When their eyes met, they trembled and asked.
1:51:48|1:52:17|The new emperor asked the empress for permission, and she answered affirmatively. After a moment of silence, the new emperor said he heard that the empress said so. The empress looked at him for a long time and then said coldly. The new emperor almost tremblingly stood up, tears already streaming down his face, with his back to the courtiers, he spoke loudly.
1:52:21|1:53:3|Upon hearing this, the eunuch glanced at [Li Di], the two of them did not see eye to eye, each shedding tears. The new emperor looked up at the sky and sighed, "The woman who seeks independence is right here on the stage." [Wu Luan] then shook the Yue Maiden Sword from her sleeve, its blade emitting a fierce aura. [Li Di] shouted out, and [Wu Luan] naturally knew that the new emperor had set up the banquet beside him. However, she was torn between her deep feelings and the pain of losing her words. At this moment, she completely disregarded her own safety.
1:53:11|1:53:39|In the dimly lit dome, under the moonlight, [Wu Luan] was blocked by several Linwei soldiers and trapped within the formation. Wu Luan halted his steps, raised his spear in defense, and confronted the remaining soldiers with Linwei. At this moment, the new emperor's voice echoed loudly from the inner chamber, calling for the Imperial Guards to protect the emperor. Without hesitation, countless Imperial Guards rushed in, clad in armor and wielding spears, standing in the grand hall leading to where the new emperor was held on the long street.
1:53:39|1:54:9|To ensure his safety, [Wu Luan] did not dare to take any risks. As he pondered how to respond, he heard the Imperial Guards rushing towards him from behind. He leaped into the air and forcefully kicked out, forcing the two men back. Upon landing, he swiftly turned around and thrust his short sword forward, shattering the masks of the guards in front of him. The force was so great that the guards fell to the ground, unable to get up. Meanwhile, [Wu Luan] used a rope to connect the sword hilt, turning the short sword into a long whip, displaying great skill and determination.
1:54:9|1:54:29|The limited time is like a fierce tiger, driving forward and backward like a dragon, and the soft sword of the Yue maiden is already proficient in close combat. Now, [Wu Luan] uses the long sword to control and defeat the enemy three feet away, making it difficult for the enemy to get close, and the short sword of [Wu Luan] may either splash like a rainbow, pointing directly at the new emperor, and then
1:54:50|1:55:4|The new emperor in the palace ordered the Imperial Guards to make way, took a golden goblet from the table, looked back at [Wu Luan] below the hall, and then spoke loudly.
1:55:6|1:55:20|The new emperor raised the golden goblet and walked through the Feather Forest Guards from left and right, steadily climbed the steps, and sat on the throne. The empress had wiped away her tears and restored her composure, but her face turned cold as she saw the situation change drastically. She also saw her brother handing over a handkerchief with poisoned wine.
1:55:20|1:55:36|Approaching [Wu Luan], the atmosphere became tense, and for a moment, the new emperor, fearless, stood beneath the sword, gazing at [Wu Luan], and spoke.
1:56:15|1:56:29|With his eyes fixed on this spot, the new emperor seemed to have thought of something. He slowly raised his head to look up at the dome of the hall, tears shimmering in his eyes. After a long pause, he swallowed the lump in his throat and finally spoke.
1:56:43|1:56:50|With that, she lowered her eyes, paying no attention to the wind in front of her, avoiding looking confused, and then sighed deeply.
1:57:3|1:57:20|After saying so, the new emperor took the golden goblet under the sword of [Wu Luan], placed it to his lips, and swallowed the poisoned wine forcefully. [Wu Luan] did not understand, but did not stop him either, only silently watching his uncle swallow the poisoned wine. After a moment, the new emperor threw the goblet aside, feeling uncomfortable, with a sense of breathlessness and unsteady steps.
1:57:20|1:57:30|The Empress saw the new Emperor in such a state, her shoulders trembling, tears welling up in her eyes. It was unclear whether she was saddened by not wanting to part with the new Emperor, or if she was overjoyed at having her wishes fulfilled.
1:57:30|1:57:59|Feeling that he was at the end of his life, the new emperor turned and walked towards the palace. Along the way, the officials on the street were removed by the imperial guards and brought to the side of the empress. They were then placed at her feet. The new emperor, feeling weak, lay down in the empress's arms and looked at her.
1:57:59|1:58:23|With a pair of jade hands covering her face, tears streaming down, Wan Hou's previous calm and stern demeanor had completely disappeared. It seemed that witnessing the new emperor's deep affection had caused her to shed tears uncontrollably. The new emperor, after drinking poison and collapsing, suddenly knelt down and cried out that the emperor had passed away. The entire court, both civil and military officials, all showed their respect to mourn the emperor's passing.
1:58:23|1:58:30|The Imperial Guards are no longer on guard against division, His Highness remains unmoved like a mountain, as if witnessing the new emperor's death from poison.
1:58:32|1:58:45|[Wu Luan] removed the rope from his wrist and dropped it along with the short sword to the ground to avenge his great enemy. He looked up at the sky. Just as he was mourning the spirit of the late king in heaven, he saw the empress kneeling behind him and speaking, "Your Majesty,"
1:58:56|1:59:3|No matter how you handle it, the Empress Dowager spoke up in front of him and listened to [Wu Luan]. She said to call this evil name.
1:59:16|1:59:40|[Wu Luan] grabbed the sword blade, only to hear [Yin Jun] say that it was poisoned. In just a moment, the wound where [Wu Luan] was cut by the dagger had already festered. In the blink of an eye, the Empress remained cold-faced, using a short sword to pierce through the throat of the assassin, and then turned to examine [Wu Luan]'s wound.
2:0:9|2:0:30|The dagger's poison was fierce, and [Wu Luan] had no desire to live on. Now that the great revenge has been avenged, she chose to die as the poison took effect.
2:0:33|2:0:49|[Wan Hou] hoarsely called out for her lover's life, never expecting such an outcome despite all her calculations. In the grand hall lay the bodies of the four children of the former emperor and the current emperor, [Yin Taichang], surrounded by court officials and military officers who turned a blind eye.
2:0:49|2:0:57|Sitting as a guest, [Wan Hou] calmly observed the situation in the court, while the ministers were all stunned. Such composure was rare. Tonight at the banquet,
2:0:57|2:1:32|In the morning hall, the candles were bright like daylight, with silk and light interweaving, birds singing and dancing. But now it is extremely desolate and cold, with a gloomy atmosphere. [Wan Hou] is in this cold forest, embracing [Wu Luan] who has lost her body. Just as she is struggling to heal herself, a sudden realization echoes in the hall, with people bowing to [Wan Hou] and shouting, "Long live the Empress!" The night banquet ends here, and [Wan Hou] ascends to the throne alone.
2:1:32|2:1:36|Only those he loved and those who loved him have already left.
2:1:51|2:2:8|In the midst of this heavy snowfall, [Yin Taichang] is seen, disheveled and covered in frost and snow, walking in the world at the twilight of his life. Only the Xuanbao Jade Screen from the snowy mountains accompanies him, seemingly mocking [Yin Taichang], as he lies in wait for the long-awaited moment in the ice and snow.
2:2:8|2:2:15|The clear sky and boundless horizon only witnessed the tragic scene of the old bidding farewell to the young. In the midst of the weaving and dyeing, [Wan Hou] appeared desolate and sorrowful, with no words spoken by her son.
2:3:21|2:3:43|At this point, [Wan Hou] actually smiled foolishly. Today, without any makeup, he looked as if he had regained the appearance of Wan'er. He almost knelt on the ground, trembling with both hands. He touched the scarlet silk fabric that had shaped his current appearance, touching the desires that were once fiery and now silent.
2:4:32|2:4:52|With that said, the sword's edge clashed, and a short sword from an unknown origin, along with the falling snow, pierced through the hall and into the residence of [Wan Hou]. As the surrounding maids and women fled in panic, not a single one stepped forward to help. [Wan Hou] felt a burning sensation on her chest as she dropped the red cloth from her arms.
2:4:52|2:5:4|[Wan Hou] endured the sharp pain in her chest and abdomen as she saw the soft sword of the Yue woman pierce through where her heart was supposed to be. Just as she was about to investigate further, the short sword was suddenly pulled out and disappeared without a trace.
