0:2:12|0:2:18|With only a black cat present, just as she looked incredulous, the black cat spoke again.
0:2:19|0:2:28|[Chun Qin] was quite frightened by this strange occurrence. She quickly placed a whole plate of melons not far from the demon cat, and took the opportunity while it was stretching to make her escape.
0:2:29|0:2:44|Upon seeing [Chun Qin] leave, the talking cat did not chase after her, but remained in a lazy manner. [Chun Qin] was in a panic and hurried to the room on the third floor. Just as she was recalling how the cat could speak human language, suddenly another meow broke her thoughts.
0:2:44|0:2:58|She couldn't care about her fear and hurried to the window to check. Suddenly, the voice of the demon cat came from behind again. [Chun Qin] was startled and turned around abruptly.
0:3:13|0:3:20|The demon cat, despite limping on its left hind leg, effortlessly leaped onto the front window before leaving with a parting remark.
0:3:22|0:3:32|After the demon cat finished speaking, it jumped out of the window. However, [Chun Qin] stood still in place. Suddenly, her eyes flashed, as if they had turned into cat eyes.
0:3:33|0:3:51|Fortunately, [Chun Qin] soon regained consciousness. She peeked out from behind the rockery and, after confirming that the demon cat had left, returned to the lakeside where she had been eating melons earlier. She saw melon peels scattered on the deck, along with a pool of blood. Following the blood trail, she found a fish with its eyeballs eaten.
0:3:51|0:4:0|Struggling desperately on the deck, blood splattered everywhere. She arrived under the pomegranate tree and, following the words of the demon cat, indeed started digging with a hoe.
0:4:1|0:4:8|Under the tree, [Chun Qin] heard her husband returning and hurried forward to greet him. Her husband, [Chen Yunqiao], is the commander of the Jinwu Guard.
0:4:10|0:4:24|She walked arm in arm with her husband and couldn't wait to get back to the room. On the way, she recounted the encounter with the demon cat and the digging for money under the tree from beginning to end. [Chen Yunqiao] found this matter too bizarre, and as soon as he entered the room, he asked [Chun Qin].
0:4:25|0:4:40|[Chun Qin] turned back to look at her husband without saying a word. She slowly opened the door and then lifted a jar from the table, pouring it out. With a clatter, gold coins covered the entire table. [Chen Yunqiao] picked up a gold coin in surprise and looked at [Chun Qin], who was looking at him with a proud expression.
0:4:41|0:4:50|The cawing of crows and the sound of wooden drums intermingled in the air above the Great Wall, entering [Kong Hai]'s ears as he sat in the sedan chair, silently contemplating.
0:4:54|0:5:12|[Kong Hai] is a monk from Japan who has come a long way to lift the curse for the emperor. He has a kind face with a faint smile at the corner of his mouth. It's hard to tell what he is really thinking from his calm expression. At this moment, he is being escorted by the royal guards to the depths of the imperial city.
0:5:12|0:5:20|The sky gradually darkened, bats kept circling low in the sky, and the lanterns under the eaves emitted a faint light.
0:5:29|0:5:48|The attendant [Bai Letian] wrote down on paper the date and purpose of [Kong Hai]'s visit to the palace. Following numerous royal guards, they passed through layers of gates and arrived at the emperor's sleeping chamber. The magnificent hall appeared even more splendid under the flickering candlelight, yet the emperor's wailing echoed in the air, making it particularly desolate.
0:5:48|0:6:1|The guard hurriedly brought [Kong Hai] to the Emperor's bedside. At this moment, the Emperor was lying face up, hands slightly bent in a surrendering posture, with no trace of blood on his face. His eyes were staring straight up, breathing heavily.
0:6:2|0:6:8|[Master Konghai] noticed the situation and asked the young minister standing beside him.
0:6:12|0:6:20|[Master Konghai] listened and vaguely sensed that something was wrong. Suddenly, a sharp meow came from above.
0:6:21|0:6:41|The demon cat strikes again. [Master Konghai] vigilantly scans the hall, about to investigate, when suddenly a piercing scream comes from behind. The Emperor's face, once lifeless, flushes with blood, his eyes turning gray. He leaps up, then falls heavily back onto the bed. At this moment, [Master Konghai] is certain that the Emperor's illness is the work of the demon cat.
0:6:41|0:6:45|Suddenly, the sound of the bell rang out, and the courtiers all knelt down.
0:6:50|0:7:6|[Bai Letian] hesitated and didn't start writing. Just as the imperial physician urged him to write, [Kong Hai] noticed footprints on the ground. A junior official at the door cautioned.
0:7:11|0:7:19|Kong Hai made a soft exclamation. Looking down, Kong Hai realized that his feet were covered with many shiny things.
0:7:25|0:7:33|Just as [Kong Hai] was puzzled in silence, lost in thought in the distance, he suddenly heard someone calling him from behind.
0:7:34|0:7:41|[Master Konghai] turned around and unexpectedly saw [Bai Letian] walking towards him.
0:8:14|0:8:26|[Bai Letian] took the hair from [Master Konghai] and examined it carefully before saying something. Suddenly, as if [Master Konghai] had discovered something, he quickly walked forward. Following the direction pointed by [Master Konghai's] finger,
0:8:28|0:8:34|Under the moonlight, [Bai Letian] discovered fluorescent cat footprints on the ground of the imperial city.
0:8:50|0:8:57|Between the two of them talking, a wooden sign suddenly appeared on the ground. [Kong Hai] bent down to pick it up, but the wooden sign moved on its own, startling [Bai Letian]. [Kong Hai] picked up the wooden sign, and there was writing on it.
0:9:8|0:9:13|As soon as the palace courtyard was mentioned, thunder roared, as if something bad was about to happen.
0:9:13|0:9:28|That night in the mansion of [Chen Yunqiao], he was enjoying a romantic moment with [Chun Qin]. The two were in bed together when they suddenly heard the sound of broken tiles outside. Sensing it was the work of a demon cat, [Chun Qin] whispered to [Chen Yunqiao]'s ear.
0:9:40|0:9:47|But at this moment, [Chen Yunqiao] only wanted to be in the land of tenderness, he pounced on [Chun Qin], with no thoughts of anything else in his mind.
0:9:48|0:9:57|Little did he know that, through the moonlight, the shadow of a cat was cast on the wall inside their house, watching their every move.
0:9:57|0:10:15|In the middle of the night, [Bai Letian] sneaked into the Imperial Library in the Imperial Hall. The hall was filled with boxes of all sizes. He stepped on a wooden box and reached for a small box on top labeled "Phoenix Perch Tower." After grabbing it, he looked around cautiously to make sure no one was watching before carefully opening the box.
0:10:15|0:10:19|Inside the box is a key carved with a phoenix and the words "Death upon intrusion".
0:10:20|0:10:37|Suddenly there was a sound of the door opening, and he quickly blew out the candle and sneaked out. Taking advantage of the night, he hid in the artificial mountain in the palace, and when he saw no one chasing after him, he headed towards the Phoenix Pavilion. He swiftly passed through the secret passage hidden in the artificial mountain, and from the way he moved so skillfully, it was clear that he had been there before.
0:10:37|0:10:53|Before long, he arrived at the Phoenix Perch. Pushing open the heavy door, he found it empty inside. Walking up the towering cloud ladder, he finally reached the inner hall. Looking up, he saw various constellation patterns embedded on the dome.
0:10:54|0:11:5|In the middle of the hall stood a round cloisonné box three people high. Unfortunately, he didn't have time to admire the scenery in the hall carefully. He took three steps and stepped onto the steps in front of the cloisonné box, taking out the key he had stolen from the Imperial Hall.
0:11:5|0:11:14|He carefully opened the box with a portrait of the empress. To his surprise, inside was a box with a dragon head painted on it. Upon opening that, there was another box with a sea pattern on it.
0:11:14|0:11:25|Upon opening the patterned box, Bai Letian finally saw what was inside the cabinet. Just as he was about to reach for it, a pipa suddenly appeared behind him and started playing on its own.
0:11:26|0:11:36|To avoid alarming the patrolling soldiers outside, he quickly went to grab the pipa. After some maneuvering, he finally managed to grab hold of the pipa, but still made some noise in the process.
0:11:41|0:11:53|Just as the soldiers outside were puzzled, suddenly the mechanism inside the house was triggered again. At the critical moment, [Bai Letian] took a big step forward to the cabinet, took out the sachet from it, and iron arrows poured down from the roof, deeply piercing into the ground.
0:11:53|0:12:3|Luckily he reacted quickly and escaped. Just as he rushed down the ladder, he suddenly heard the voices of the soldiers. He hid behind the door, and then a cat's meow suddenly sounded.
0:12:5|0:12:12|The guards outside the house saw a cat appearing on the railing of the gap, thinking that the noise just now was made by the cat, so they didn't investigate further.
0:12:13|0:12:17|Bai Letian, hiding behind the door, thus escaped unscathed.
0:12:18|0:12:24|The next morning, [Bai Letian] went to visit [Master Konghai], only to find [Master Konghai] packing his bags at home. He bowed to [Master Konghai].
0:12:37|0:12:48|He sat down on the couch while speaking, and added.
0:14:54|0:15:6|[Bai Letian] said triumphantly, then turned around and walked away. [Kong Hai] smiled and followed suit. The two of them walked and chatted along the bustling streets of Chang'an.
0:15:31|0:15:46|The distant sound of the bell from the Great Blue Dragon Temple was heard as they were talking. Accompanied by the melodious bell sound, the two passed through the bustling acrobatic performance and were finally attracted by the shouting of a melon farmer.
0:15:54|0:16:6|The two walked through the crowd to the melon farmer. He first showed the watermelon seeds to everyone, then bent down to plant the seeds in the ground, and covered them with soil using his feet. He then took out a water bottle to show to everyone, and proceeded to water the newly planted watermelon.
0:16:6|0:16:21|In front of everyone's eyes, something magical happened - the watermelon seeds sprouted. Not only did they sprout, but they grew taller and taller. Soon, the watermelon vines extended and began to entwine around the trellis.
0:16:22|0:16:45|Some were puzzled, some were surprised, with various expressions. Following the instructions of the farmer, the watermelon quickly climbed the entire trellis, bloomed, and eventually bore a large watermelon. While Bai Letian and the others cheered and applauded, Kong Hai remained indifferent.
0:16:56|0:17:5|Just as [Bai Letian] felt that [Kong Hai] was unreasonable, a melon farmer picked a watermelon, cut it with a knife, revealing the flesh inside, and the crowd applauded again. Reluctantly, [Bai Letian] followed [Kong Hai] as they left, when suddenly the melon farmer rushed up to them.
0:17:44|0:17:50|After the melon farmer finished speaking, he stuffed the watermelon into [Kong Hai]'s arms, laughed heartily, and turned away. [Kong Hai] walked through the market holding the melon, when suddenly [Bai Letian] noticed something was wrong.
0:17:59|0:18:3|After saying that, Bai Letian snatched the fish head from Kong Hai's hand and ran off. Kong Hai stared at the fish blood on his hand.
0:18:23|0:18:31|The two arrived outside the imperial city to find [Chen Yunqiao], and happened to see him finishing his duty, chatting with his men about having fun tonight.
0:18:32|0:18:38|A group of people set off on horseback, whistling as they go, with [Bai Letian] pointing at the receding figures and saying to [Kong Hai].
0:18:39|0:18:52|[Chen Yunqiao] was seen hunched over, squinting, sitting on a horse looking rather unhappy. [Bai Letian] and [Kong Hai], without horses, could only take shortcuts to chase after them as much as possible. After a chase, [Chen Yunqiao] and the others dismounted at the ferry crossing, preparing to change boats.
0:19:19|0:19:32|Upon hearing that [Kong Hai] was going to the brothel, [Bai Letian] couldn't help but laugh. The Hu Yulou was built by the water, accompanied by the sound of the river waves, as the sky gradually darkened. Soon, the twinkling lights formed a cluster, and beautiful singing could be heard coming from the building.
0:19:42|0:19:57|At this moment, [Chen Yunqiao] stood unmoved at the bow of the boat despite the soft calls of the girls. It turns out he has a lover named [Bai Ling] at the Hu Yulou. Just as [Bai Ling] was about to go find her lover [Chen Yunqiao], she suddenly bumped into [Chen Yunqiao] who was scrutinizing [Yu Lian] up and down.
0:20:0|0:20:6|Chen Yunqiao was immediately attracted to the beauty of Yu Lian.
0:20:17|0:20:32|After saying that, [Yu Lian] was taken away, completely forgetting about her lover [Bai Ling]. Enraged, [Bai Ling] viciously stabbed the jade hairpin into the nearby armrest. She stormed back to her room, only to be surprised to find the jade hairpin she had just stabbed into the armrest, miraculously intact on the table.
0:20:35|0:20:41|She picked up the jade hairpin and examined it carefully, confirming it was hers. Just as she was puzzled, she suddenly heard a strange voice.
0:20:42|0:20:54|Mysterious things happened again, the wine pot on the table poured wine into the cup by itself, startling [Bai Ling] who kept retreating. As the wine in the cup was filled, [Bai Ling]'s expression also changed.
0:20:55|0:21:12|A gust of demonic wind surrounded her, and she casually tossed aside a jade hairpin. Her eyes stared straight ahead, with dark eye sockets and glowing eyeballs, as if possessed by a demon. The scene shifted to outside the house, where a bright moon was reflected on the lake, and [Bai Letian] and [Master Konghai] approached in a boat.
0:21:20|0:21:36|After the two of them finished speaking, they burst into laughter. At this moment, [Chen Yunqiao] was focused on watching [Yu Lian] dance, thoroughly enjoying it. Wearing a flowing robe and with waist-length hair, her graceful movements, accompanied by the lingering sound of the pipa, captivated everyone, leaving them entranced by the dancing [Yu Lian].
0:21:36|0:21:48|With the rhythm of the music, she gracefully moves her wrist and lowers her brows, captivating the audience with every gesture. Suddenly, a seductive and charming woman with enchanting smiles also joins in, stirring the hearts of everyone present, including [Yu Lian].
0:21:48|0:22:0|Enter. Suddenly, his eyes furrowed as if filled with endless sorrow. Then, a radiant smile appeared on his face as if filled with boundless joy. Truly embodying the saying, "Such a scene exists only in heaven, rarely seen in the human world."
0:22:1|0:22:8|On the other side, [Bai Letian] and [Master Konghai] also arrived. As the two of them were going upstairs, a constable stopped [Bai Letian].
0:22:21|0:22:30|[Bai Letian] and [Master Konghai] arrived at the hall with ease, just in time to see [Yu Lian] gracefully spinning in the center of the hall with her veil, indicating that this exquisite and unparalleled dance performance was finally coming to an end.
0:22:30|0:22:39|But Master Konghai suddenly became interested and quietly walked behind Yu Lian. Yu Lian pretended to fall, and Master Konghai supported her with his long sleeves, and the two of them jumped up again.
0:22:40|0:22:50|I didn't expect the Japanese monk to dance. His hand movements were like a butterfly fluttering around [Yu Lian]. The two interacted frequently, and with his accompanying dance, [Yu Lian]'s dance gained a different kind of charm.
0:22:50|0:22:59|[Chen Yunqiao] and the others were watching with great interest. After another dance, [Bai Letian] pulled [Master Konghai] to a corridor and started mocking him.
0:23:6|0:23:20|[Kong Hai] laughed heartily. During the conversation, Lixiang walked over with a wine glass. [Kong Hai] noticed something unusual about Lixiang's hairpin and took a closer look. When Lixiang realized this, she coldly snorted at [Kong Hai], then turned on her heels and walked straight towards [Chen Yunqiao], respectfully handing the wine to him.
0:23:21|0:23:33|[Chen Yunqiao] didn't even glance at Lixiang, just coldly took the wine glass, then leered at the dancing [Yu Lian]. After the song ended, he stood up unsteadily and casually said to everyone.
0:23:47|0:23:52|[Yu Lian] looked at Lixiang, knowing that Lixiang was angry with her for stealing her lover. She was momentarily at a loss for how to respond.
0:23:52|0:24:10|At this moment, [Chen Yunqiao] handed himself a drink, and [Yu Lian] happened to finish it in one gulp. Just as everyone was enjoying themselves, suddenly [Kong Hai] felt like there was something upstairs, and the laughter around him seemed to become sharp and eerie. The painted sea on the screen turned into a real sea, and in an instant, the waves surged.
0:24:10|0:24:15|Suddenly, the shadow of a cat appeared on the screen.
0:24:16|0:24:23|It turns out to be that talking cat demon again. At this moment, [Chen Yunqiao] hears someone calling his name and looks around drunkenly.
0:24:44|0:24:50|[Chen Yunqiao] felt uncomfortable hearing this and immediately stood up to address everyone.
0:25:5|0:25:22|As soon as the demon cat finished speaking, Bai Letian's dagger stabbed into the screen, and the shadow of the demon cat disappeared instantly, with a sudden burst of firelight from the candles on the wall. The dancers were so scared that they dared not move.
0:25:22|0:25:43|The Jinwu Guards drew their swords in defense, but at this moment, Li Xiang quietly stood up from behind [Chen Yunqiao]. Suddenly, a shadow passed through the neck of [Chen Yunqiao]. He touched his neck and found blood on his hand, with three deep scratch marks appearing on his face. He quickly drew his sword, and a fierce battle was about to begin. The girls from the Huyu Tower had never seen such a scene before and all fled in all directions.
0:25:46|0:25:56|At this moment, a black shadow swept across the top of them, one step, two steps, extinguishing the candlelight wherever it went. An observant [Jin Wuwei] spotted the whereabouts of the demon cat.
0:25:57|0:26:10|As soon as the words fell, the sword stabbed towards the demon cat. The demon cat leaped down, passed by the feet of the Jinwu Guards, and everyone fell to the ground. Fortunately, [Bai Letian] quickly closed the door and was not discovered by the demon cat, escaping a disaster. But the people inside were not so lucky.
0:26:10|0:26:31|Some were scratched and fell to the ground by the cat demon, some were knocked and fell off the building, and others were thrown high in the air by the cat demon and then fell heavily. However, the cat demon did not harm the powerless girls. It jumped onto the table and then called out to Chen Yunqiao.
0:26:32|0:26:51|After the demon cat finished speaking, it swaggered past the Jinwu Guards. None of them dared to move, all watching as the demon cat leaped over the fence outside the door. The demon cat looked back at the collapsed Jinwu Guards, leaving in a victorious manner.
0:26:51|0:27:0|The demon cat fled in a panic as soon as [Chen Yunqiao] left, and Li Xiang seemed to be acting guilty, lowering her head sneakily as if she had done something wrong. At this moment, she suddenly encountered a Jinwuwei whose eyes had been gouged out by the demon cat.
0:27:4|0:27:17|Seeing Jin Wuwei's eyes bloodshot and terrifying, causing Lixiang to scream in fear. At the same time, [Chun Qin] also fainted on the ground. On the other side, [Chen Yunqiao] ran back home with sweat on his forehead, pushed open the courtyard door to find nothing unusual, finally breathed a sigh of relief, and was about to run into the house.
0:27:17|0:27:25|Suddenly he saw [Chun Qin] sitting by the lake with her back to him. When [Chun Qin] didn't respond, he felt a bit worried and ran through the long corridor to where she was.
0:27:25|0:27:41|When he arrived, [Chun Qin] had disappeared without a trace. Just as he was puzzled, he suddenly noticed that the lake seemed different from usual. He walked to the edge of the lake to investigate and found that dead fish with their eyes gouged out were floating all over the lake, which scared him so much that his legs went weak and he almost fell into the water.
0:27:42|0:27:49|The next morning, [Master Konghai] and others arrived at the crime scene of Hu Yulou with the officials and soldiers.
0:28:28|0:28:33|Li Shaojian realized that he had wrongly accused Bai Letian before, so he walked up to him to apologize for what happened before.
0:28:48|0:28:53|[Master Konghai] was moved by [Bai Letian]'s unyielding attitude and grabbed him, bowing to him.
0:29:0|0:29:8|Li Shaojian stood by the lake and talked to the two people.
0:29:19|0:29:26|Bidding farewell, [Li Shaojian] and the two walked back on the road.
0:30:14|0:30:27|Master Konghai's myriad thoughts could not find an answer. Bai Letian brought him to a city tower.
0:30:30|0:30:50|[Master Konghai] listened and then turned to gaze at the distant imperial city. Suddenly, the weather changed dramatically, and [Master Konghai] snorted coldly.
0:30:52|0:31:1|As the sky darkened, finally arriving at the second night agreed upon with the demon cat, [Chen Yunqiao] and [Chun Qin] lay on the bed with anxious hearts.
0:31:8|0:31:17|As soon as the two finished speaking, a black shadow swiftly leaped over the courtyard wall.
0:31:24|0:31:39|Just as the two were shifting blame onto each other, a cat's shadow appeared on the lantern of the Chen family's night patrol servant. The Taoist priest in the courtyard, holding peach wood and reciting sutras with his mouth, was completely unaware. And so, the demon cat easily made its way into the inner courtyard hidden in the servant's lantern.
0:31:39|0:31:57|At the entrance of the inner courtyard, another Taoist priest is performing a ritual with peach wood. The shadow of the demon cat is directly printed on the wall behind the Taoist, but unfortunately, he still hasn't noticed. And so, the demon cat enters the room again, walks up the stairs, and passes through the door crack to the second floor. The corridor is empty, and the demon cat struts through it confidently.
0:31:57|0:32:16|Arriving at the staircase, with only the last flight of stairs remaining, the demon cat would soon meet the couple [Chen Yunqiao]. It quietly climbed the final step and encountered a Taoist priest. The priest sat at a table with his eyes closed, continuously chanting a spell. The demon cat leaped lightly onto the table.
0:32:16|0:32:25|The Taoist priest Bai Letian slowly opened his eyes upon hearing a noise, only to find the demon cat staring at him. The demon cat extended its sharp claws, ready to take the priest's life in an instant.
0:32:25|0:32:43|In the room, [Chen Yunqiao] was awakened and hastily picked up his sword. Without bothering to put on his clothes properly, he opened the door to look around. Large bloodstains on the ground caught his eye, and he knew it was the work of the demon cat. With his clothes disheveled, he tightly gripped the sword and carefully followed the bloodstains downstairs to investigate.
0:32:43|0:33:5|As he pushed open the door, he suddenly found the bodies of two Taoist priests lying at his feet. He was so scared that he scrambled upstairs to find [Chun Qin]. Suddenly, he heard [Chun Qin]'s miserable cry and rushed into the room. As soon as he entered, he was stunned. It turned out that the demon cat was lying on [Chun Qin]'s legs at this time, and [Chun Qin] seemed to have changed. She was actually playing with the cat.
0:33:5|0:33:25|The demon cat spoke to [Chen Yunqiao]. With a swipe of its claws, it left a scratch on the snowy white neck of [Chun Qin]. [Chen Yunqiao] fled in panic, no longer caring to save [Chun Qin]. In an instant, he ran to the gate and shouted at the guards.
0:33:36|0:33:45|[Chun Qin] stood by the bed calling for help to her husband, but suddenly she was dragged into the room by the demon cat. Seeing this, [Chen Yunqiao] quickly ran towards [Chun Qin], but suddenly he closed the door and locked it from the outside.
0:33:45|0:34:0|A strange laughter was heard, and looking towards it, it turned out to be [Chun Qin]. Oddly, wasn't she just upstairs? How did she appear in front of him now? [Chen Yunqiao] staggered to [Chun Qin] and cautiously said in a low voice.
0:34:4|0:34:18|The woman with the appearance of [Chun Qin] suddenly took out a fish and ate its eyeball in front of [Chen Yunqiao], frightening him to flee in panic.
0:34:33|0:34:44|Peony followed Master Konghai's instructions to fetch fresh meat with blood on it, while Bai Letian couldn't help but step forward to check Yu Lian's injuries. Seeing Yu Lian's festering leg, Bai Letian was greatly shocked.
0:34:47|0:34:53|At this moment, [Chen Yunqiao] also arrived at the Hu Yulou. He knocked hard on the door of his old friend Lixiang, hoping to hide here for a while.
0:34:56|0:35:7|In Lijiang, the cold-hearted [Chen Yunqiao] took one look and huffed before shutting the door. Suddenly, he saw Peony carrying raw meat and decided to follow her. Meanwhile, [Kong Hai] was writing densely packed words on [Yu Lian]'s calf.
0:35:10|0:35:17|[Master Konghai] spoke as he lifted the skirt covering [Yu Lian]'s knees.
0:35:31|0:35:38|Following Master Konghai's orders, Mudan held Yu Lian, Bai Letian carried raw meat, and he pierced Yu Lian's toes with a needle, causing blood to flow instantly.
0:35:39|0:35:49|[Bai Letian] quickly caught the blood flowing from [Yu Lian]'s toe with raw meat, and the meat in the bowl turned into millions of worms wriggling in an instant. At this moment, [Chen Yunqiao] hiding behind the door saw [Kong Hai] detoxifying with raw meat.
0:36:18|0:36:25|Chen Yunqiao, hiding behind the door, saw Kong Hai's superb magic skills, so he pushed the door open and knelt directly on the ground, begging Kong Hai for help.
0:36:27|0:36:46|Upon learning about the strange occurrences at the Chen residence from [Chen Yunqiao], [Kong Hai] and [Bai Letian] hurried there under the moonlight. The Chen residence was shrouded in a eerie atmosphere under the moonlight, and suddenly the two noticed [Chun Qin] appearing on the roof, reciting poetry.
0:36:51|0:37:1|Suddenly, [Chun Qin] slipped and almost fell, [Kong Hai] immediately walked forward. Realizing what happened, [Bai Letian] hurried to catch up, and the two finally found [Chun Qin]'s bedroom, only to see her lying on the bed.
0:37:32|0:37:50|After that, [Kong Hai] left the Chen residence with [Bai Letian]. At this moment, the shadow of the demon cat appeared again. As the sky gradually brightened, [Bai Letian] sneaked into the imperial city with [Kong Hai]. Fortunately, it was the time for the guards to change shifts, so they took advantage of the timing to sneak into a palace.
0:37:50|0:37:57|The books in the hall cover the entire wall, with bookshelves neatly arranged in the middle. Asked [Master Konghai].
0:38:7|0:38:17|Climbing up the ladder while talking. [Kong Hai] pushes from below, [Bai Letian] searches above, and finally the two stop in front of the history section bookshelf. Just as [Bai Letian] is searching around.
0:38:17|0:38:26|[Master Konghai] suddenly noticed a firefly flying below, and it landed right on the daily record of Emperor [Tang Xuanzong]'s life during the Kaiyuan era that [Bai Letian] was looking for.
0:40:16|0:40:24|[Bai Letian] excitedly describes to [Kong Hai] the love of [Li Longji] for [Yang Yuhuan].
0:40:38|0:40:45|Although [Bai Letian] spoke passionately, [Kong Hai] remained unmoved.
0:41:2|0:41:21|[Bai Letian] spoke as if he had really traveled back to the time of [Tang Xuanzong]. The gate of the Huaye Xianghui Tower opened to him, and the stunning beauty [Yang Yuhuan] slowly walked towards him. With a slight smile towards [Bai Letian], he was completely captivated. Beside him, [Kong Hai] knew that [Bai Letian] had succumbed.
0:41:21|0:41:26|Bai Letian] was immersed in his own fantasy as he spoke, and was interrupted by someone who couldn't bear it.
0:42:10|0:42:18|The melon farmer turned around and saw [Kong Hai].
0:43:12|0:43:26|In the distance, the bell of Qingyun Temple rang again. [Master Konghai] bid farewell to Guaweng, and went to find [Bai Letian] to visit the Chen Mansion again. This time, [Bai Letian] was not happy, muttering all the way, worried that he might also have his eyeballs eaten by the demon cat.
0:43:39|0:43:48|[Kong Hai] had just finished speaking when the sky suddenly changed, and in front of [Chen Yunqiao]'s house appeared a blooming cherry blossom tree, with a woman standing underneath it.
0:44:2|0:44:14|Just as they finished speaking, a mist rose behind them, but when they turned around, they found nothing unusual. [Bai Letian] approached the woman under the tree and recognized her as [Yang Yuhuan] from 30 years ago. He wanted to get closer to [Yang Yuhuan], but [Master Konghai] behind him reminded him.
0:44:16|0:44:21|After [Kong Hai] finished speaking, the noble consort disappeared along with the tree in front of [Bai Letian], and the sky cleared up again.
0:44:21|0:44:32|It turns out that everything just now was an illusion. After pushing open the door of [Chen Yunqiao]'s house for just one night, [Chen Yunqiao]'s house seemed to have passed many years. Weeds grew in the courtyard, making it look like an abandoned desolate house for many years.
0:44:33|0:44:52|As they were talking, suddenly the voice of [Chun Qin] came, and they saw her sitting by the window shouting at the two. [Bai Letian] and [Kong Hai] went upstairs, and [Chun Qin], in a long dress, looked particularly beautiful.
0:44:56|0:45:12|[Bai Letian] saw that the tea on the table was covered with silk nets, and looked uneasily at [Kong Hai]. At this moment, [Kong Hai] calmly took a seat, although he was full of doubts in his heart, he had no choice but to sit down as well. Little did he know that as soon as [Kong Hai] sat down, he picked up the tea cup covered with silk nets and took a sip, and no one could stop him.
0:45:29|0:45:45|After [Kong Hai] and [Chun Qin] finished speaking, they burst into laughter. [Bai Letian] awkwardly chuckled along a few times. As they chatted, he picked up a teacup, and suddenly a large spider crawled out from inside. Luckily, [Kong Hai] acted quickly and tapped him twice, making the spider disappear.
0:48:39|0:48:48|[Chun Qin] did not answer, turned her back to the two of them, a tear slid from the corner of her eye.
0:48:56|0:49:9|[Bai Letian] wanted to ask further, but at this moment, [Chun Qin] had already fainted and couldn't wake up. Suddenly, a demonic wind blew through the room, sweeping away all the dried leaves inside. In an instant, [Chen Yunqiao] returned to his original appearance, and the two realized that it was another illusion created by the demon cat.
0:49:9|0:49:16|Although it was an illusion, what it said was true. The two of them did find a dried cat skin under the bed.
0:49:19|0:49:36|[Bai Letian] picked up its body and discussed with [Master Konghai] to burn it in the courtyard, which could be considered as comforting its soul. Finally, the case of the demon cat was resolved. [Chen Yunqiao] survived the crisis and then hosted a banquet for many guests, with [Chun Qin] performing a dance for the guests.
0:49:36|0:49:41|[Chen Yunqiao] raised his glass to thank [Kong Hai] and [Bai Letian].
0:49:46|0:49:53|Three people were drinking heartily below the stage, with [Chun Qin] tied to copper bells on her feet, draped in thin gauze, dancing gracefully on the drum. The guests couldn't help but applaud and cheer.
0:49:54|0:50:5|During the banquet, [Chun Qin] flung the thin veil on her shoulders in front of [Chen Yunqiao], who grabbed it and pulled her towards him with a little force. The two then started dancing, pushing the atmosphere of the banquet to a climax.
0:50:5|0:50:13|The accompaniment became more and more intense, and as the two performed more brilliantly, the intrigued Bai Letian introduced Kong Hai to the origins of this dance music.
0:50:19|0:50:29|Dancing [Chun Qin] and [Chen Yunqiao] are just like the imperial concubine and [Tang Xuanzong] from the past.
0:50:29|0:50:48|At this moment, [Chun Qin] led [Chen Yunqiao] behind the screen with a thin veil. However, when the two came out, the veil was unexpectedly wrapped around [Chun Qin]'s neck by [Chen Yunqiao]. [Kong Hai] and [Bai Letian] hurried to intervene, but [Chen Yunqiao], as if possessed by a supernatural power, leaped up and pulled [Chun Qin] onto the guests' table with the veil, shattering the dishes and utensils.
0:50:48|0:50:55|Suddenly the curtains rolled up, the doors and windows closed, red smoke rose, and the guests were scared and fled in all directions, leaving only the musicians playing more and more intensely.
0:50:56|0:51:11|[Chen Yunqiao] dragged [Chun Qin] onto the drum. The drum seemed to have a magical power, as it sucked the table over and arranged it neatly. He pushed [Chun Qin] down, his body pressing tightly against hers, and said.
0:51:21|0:51:28|[Master Konghai] stood quietly on the side, observing everything with a cold gaze. The more frenzied the musicians played, the more [Chen Yunqiao] went crazy and strangled [Chun Qin].
0:51:28|0:51:37|[Kong Hai] arrived at the musician and gently tapped the musician who was holding the pipa. The musician immediately turned around, the strange light in his eyes disappeared instantly, obviously they were both under the illusion of the demon cat.
0:51:37|0:52:4|The musician fainted, the music stopped, and [Chen Yunqiao] finally regained his senses. He suddenly realized that he was tightly gripping [Chun Qin]'s neck. Seeing [Chun Qin] lying on the drum struggling for breath, he panicked and quickly let go. Unfortunately, it was too late. With her last weak voice, [Chun Qin] said.
0:52:8|0:52:15|She stared with her eyes wide open as she was strangled to death by her own husband. [Chen Yunqiao] wiped away her tears with the hem of her clothes, as if speaking to herself and to others at the same time.
0:52:17|0:52:23|After saying goodbye to [Chen Yunqiao], he left as if nothing had happened. Suddenly, another cat meow was heard.
0:52:28|0:52:38|Outside the house, Bai Letian saw Chen Yunqiao sitting on a tree, throwing money down. Watching the tragic end of the Chen family, Bai Letian said indignantly.
0:52:48|0:52:57|But [Kong Hai] was inspired by this and questioned [Bai Letian].
0:53:18|0:53:24|Upon hearing Master Konghai's judgment, Bai Letian's face turned extremely ugly.
0:53:27|0:53:51|He angrily interrogated [Kong Hai], who remained silent. [Bai Letian] turned and walked away. Looking at [Bai Letian]'s almost frantic accusations with pity in his eyes, [Kong Hai] suddenly saw [Bai Letian] return and continue speaking. [Bai Letian] slammed the door and left [Kong Hai] alone.
0:53:52|0:54:4|The sky above Chang'an City is still shrouded in dark clouds. To uncover the truth, [Kong Hai] once again visits the home of [Bai Letian]. As soon as he enters, he sees the unwashed dishes of [Bai Letian] on the stove, with spoiled leftovers attracting flies buzzing around.
0:54:4|0:54:13|[Bai Letian] is sitting at his desk, lost in thought. His room is filled with books, and even the walls are covered with paintings.
0:54:20|0:54:36|[Master Konghai] saw a painting on the ground and picked it up casually. Looking around, he realized that the entire wall was covered with a portrait of that woman, who was [Yang Yuhuan]. [Bai Letian] hurriedly stood up, wanting to tear down the painting on the wall.
0:55:27|0:55:43|After [Kong Hai] took the painting of [Yang Yuhuan] from [Bai Letian] and left the room, hoping to give [Bai Letian] some time alone, but [Bai Letian] was not grateful. As soon as [Kong Hai] left the room, [Bai Letian] closed the door behind him. The more he thought about it, the angrier he got, and finally couldn't help but shout at [Kong Hai] through the wall,
0:57:18|0:57:36|[Kong Hai]'s love story of the long ballad is fake, completely breaking down the last defense line in [Bai Letian]'s heart. He stood in front of the door, only turning around to face [Kong Hai] after a long time, tears in his eyes as he said.
0:58:44|0:58:52|The master looked at [Kong Hai] with a reassuring gaze.
0:59:16|0:59:34|[Kong Hai] bid farewell to his deceased master, shouldered his bag, held his cane, wore wooden clogs, and stepped on the snowy road, starting his journey to the Tang Dynasty. Along the way, he had to climb steep mountains and cross vast oceans on small boats. Unfortunately, he encountered a strong storm at sea, with waves as high as 10 meters.
0:59:43|0:59:55|The wailing cries filled the air. Faced with the threat of death, [Kong Hai] showed signs of panic, but a woman beside him remained calm, soothing the child in her arms with a peaceful expression. Unable to hold back, [Kong Hai] asked.
1:0:4|1:0:19|As [Kong Hai] looked at the woman in confusion, suddenly the sea water rushed into the boat. Eventually, the small boat couldn't withstand the sea storm and sank to the bottom of the sea, with everyone being swept into the sea. Fortunately, [Kong Hai] was skilled in swimming. He struggled to swim out of the boat, but the storm did not stop, instead becoming even more violent.
1:0:19|1:0:27|The waves crashed heavily layer by layer on the sea, and due to exhaustion, he was still swept into the sea.
1:0:36|1:0:43|Just as [Kong Hai] was about to be drowned, a sudden thought crossed his mind.
1:0:56|1:1:4|[Bai Letian] was moved by [Kong Hai], and the two set out on a journey to find the truth once again.
1:2:43|1:3:0|After the two bid farewell, as usual, Nanny came to the loom to weave white silk. As she was weaving, suddenly a cat jumped onto the frame. Nanny was startled at first, then she stopped her work. She was puzzled by the sudden appearance of the cat. The cat turned its head and stared at her intently.
1:3:0|1:3:19|After a while, a fierce voice came out of the mouth. The demon cat then used its sharp claws to cut the white thread on the loom, and all the threads wrapped around the nanny's neck. In this way, the nanny was strangled to death by the white silk she had woven herself. At the same time, Bai Letian and Kong Hai were discussing the suspicious points of the death of the imperial concubine on the road.
1:3:43|1:3:49|In the midst of the conversation, the two suddenly realized that Nanny might be in danger and hurried back.
1:3:50|1:3:57|Surely at this moment, the nanny had fallen in front of the loom, her neck wrapped in white thread. Seeing the tragic death of the nanny, [Bai Letian] couldn't help but blame [Kong Hai].
1:4:0|1:4:7|Another life was taken by the demon cat, and [Bai Letian] angrily pounded his hand against the wall.
1:4:10|1:4:18|To uncover the truth, [Bai Letian] brought [Kong Hai] back to the Imperial Library. [Bai Letian] handed the documents to [Kong Hai], but he accidentally dropped them.
1:4:19|1:4:26|With a loud noise, the documents scattered all over the floor, catching the attention of [Master Konghai] with a list of missing names waiting to be filled in.
1:4:59|1:5:5|[Bai Letian] blurted out, and [Master Konghai] quickly stopped him to prevent the demon cat from hearing. In order to arrive at [Bai Ling]'s house before the demon cat could strike, the two hurried through the rain.
1:5:6|1:5:15|[Bai Ling] is a Japanese woman, standing in front of the house with a friendly expression to greet them.
1:5:17|1:5:24|[Master Konghai] walked into the room and bowed to [Bai Ling], then started conversing with her in Japanese.
1:5:57|1:6:5|[Bai Ling] lowered her head and hesitated for a long time before finally speaking.
1:6:51|1:7:8|[Bai Ling] finished speaking and then smiled bitterly. Seeing the helplessness and sadness in [Bai Ling], [Kong Hai] spoke. She didn't answer, silently turned around and led the two into the courtyard. The rain outside had stopped at some point.
1:7:8|1:7:15|[Bai Ling] walked to the grave of her husband, Mr. [Abe Nakamaro], with [Master Konghai] behind her, bowing respectfully towards [Nakamaro]'s tomb.
1:7:32|1:7:38|Perhaps it was Bai Ling who was moved by Kong Hai's words. She returned to her room and took out her husband's diary to give to Kong Hai, telling him about the contents of the diary.
1:8:4|1:8:19|[Kong Hai] and [Bai Letian] sat on the city tower and began to read, following the diary as if they had traveled back to the Xuanzong era 30 years ago. The crowd in Chang'an city that day was bustling and lively. [Abe Nakamaro] rode a spirited horse through the crowd, shining brightly.
1:8:55|1:9:3|At this moment, [Yang Yuhuan] was draped in a light gauze, wearing a splendid peony on her head, swaying on a high swing in the lingering sunset.
1:9:3|1:9:17|She not only received the admiration of the people in Chang'an City, but also stirred the heart of [Abe Nakamaro], all because of a glance at [Yang Yuhuan], planting a seed of love in his heart. [Abe Nakamaro] decided to confess his love to [Yang Yuhuan].
1:9:26|1:9:41|Following Abe Nakamaro's diary, Bai Letian and Kong Hai discovered the extravagant feast held by Tang Xuanzong 30 years ago to celebrate Yang Yuhuan's birthday. The city of Chang'an was brightly lit at that time, with fireworks bursting in the sky.
1:9:41|1:10:0|The tinkling laughter echoed in the ears. A dreamlike phoenix carriage slowly moved along Chang'an Street in the city. Even before the grand feast began, [Abe Nakamaro] was already seen following it with great excitement. He hurried through the crowded streets and soon arrived at the banquet venue, the Flower Brilliance Pavilion.
1:10:0|1:10:16|[Abe Nakamaro] is about to meet [Yang Yuhuan] here, and he can hardly contain his excitement. Suddenly, two mischievous girls appear in front of the building. They draw whiskers on their mouths to disguise themselves as men, peeking out from the doorway with a smile, watching the continuous stream of visitors outside.
1:10:16|1:10:28|[Abe Nakamaro] was amused by the two young girls and followed them through the crowd, finally arriving at the banquet hall. Above the hall, there were dancers with various expressions, like a painting unfolding before everyone's eyes.
1:10:29|1:10:43|Just as everyone marveled at how the dancer was flying in the sky and staying still, suddenly the wine pot hanging in the air poured out fine wine on its own, which flowed into the dancer's mouth in an instant. Before the dancer could savor it, the wine pot crashed to the ground and shattered.
1:10:43|1:10:48|Strangely, the fragments slowly grew into flowers. Then even more miraculous things happened.
1:10:48|1:11:3|The sea of flowers on the ground unexpectedly turned into a canvas, which was lifted by someone, and red wine slowly overflowed from underneath. In no time, a wine pool appeared. Above the wine pool, a flute suddenly appeared and lightly tapped it twice. A [White Robed Maiden] leaped out of the wine pool.
1:11:3|1:11:16|[White-robed Maiden] reached out to grab the flute, but the mischievous flute flew higher and higher. Unwilling to give up, [White-robed Maiden] stepped on a auspicious cloud and followed it up. They flew higher and higher, until they reached the sky. Finally, she managed to grab the flute in the clouds.
1:11:16|1:11:24|The flute had no choice but to obey, and soon the sound of the flute came from the sky, accompanied by the gentle patter of raindrops.
1:11:25|1:11:35|Some people were suddenly startled by the rain, some clapped and cheered, while others danced in the rain. [Abe Nakamaro] was once again amazed by the fantastic performance before his eyes.
1:11:35|1:11:48|It's strange, the [White-robed Maiden] playing the flute is clearly in the clouds, how could there be a shadow reflecting on the water surface, and the shadow is even separating from the [White-robed Maiden], suddenly turning into a water droplet falling rapidly downwards. Just before hitting the ground, it transforms back into a man.
1:11:48|1:11:56|The crowd was startled, thinking the man had accidentally fallen from above. Suddenly, the man somersaulted and landed steadily on a red line.
1:11:56|1:12:13|Using the bouncing power of the rope, the man soared into the sky again and pulled the girl playing the flute down. The two of them suddenly plunged into the wine pool, and the dancers beside the wine pool waved their sleeves together. The two of them transformed into two golden carps and dashed out. They intertwined in the air, gradually turning into two graceful young men.
1:12:13|1:12:32|The most amazing thing was that the boy's clothes changed from the red Ni Chang to the white feather robe. Their wonderful performance pushed the atmosphere to a climax, and everyone applauded. Abe was completely impressed by this fantastic performance. Just as he reached out to touch the dancer, the dancer suddenly turned into a wisp of green smoke and disappeared.
1:12:32|1:12:41|The performance came to an end, but the more exciting moment began as [Yang Yuhuan] appeared.
1:13:8|1:13:18|[Yang Yuhuan] did not answer, but instead asked [Gao Lishi]. As she walked forward, suddenly her skirt was stepped on, and when she turned around, she saw that it was the Emperor.
1:13:18|1:13:26|The emperor covered half of his face with his skirt, making everyone laugh heartily. The empress was also amused by the emperor, and the two of them walked to the center of the hall together.
1:13:29|1:13:40|A Taoist priest stood in front of the emperor and the empress, tossing a piece of origami into the air. The origami instantly transformed into a fierce tiger, causing the guests to flee in all directions.
1:13:42|1:13:56|As the fierce tiger leaped into the crowd, it suddenly transformed into pink petals floating in the air, shocking everyone once again with the scene before them. The Taoist performer concluded the act and explained to the Emperor and the Empress.
1:14:20|1:14:24|They would snatch the grapes that were almost in someone's mouth when no one was paying attention, and then take away the fine wine from a rich man's hands.
1:14:26|1:14:40|After finishing the wine, he casually threw the wine glass into the Taiye Pool, unexpectedly turning the glass into a magpie that flew away. As they ran past [Abe Nakamaro], they even threw him a bunch of grapes.
1:14:47|1:14:55|The two young men transformed into white cranes as they soared above the Huaye Xianghui Tower, undoubtedly adding a vivid touch to the feast of paradise.
1:14:56|1:15:10|Watching the white crane youth flying in the air, everyone was surprised, even the noble concubine. Reading this, [Bai Letian] was surprised to find that the demon cat had also appeared at the banquet.
1:15:22|1:15:28|[Li Bai] got drunk and was forcibly carried by [Gao Lishi] to the side of the Taiye Pool.
1:16:40|1:16:54|Gao Lishi didn't want to be framed by Li Bai, so he grabbed Li Bai's boots and pulled them off. Seeing his plan succeed, Li Bai happily crawled to the nearby wine pool and stuck his head in to drink.
1:17:3|1:17:14|The two were discussing the Empress's emerald hairpin when, upon turning around, they found the Empress standing behind them. In order to prove his identity and to show off, [Dan Long] intentionally transformed into a white crane in front of the Empress.
1:17:24|1:17:33|The noble concubine admired the handsome young man in front of her. [Dan Long] could only reluctantly offer his hands.
1:18:55|1:19:8|He recited while writing, slowly leaning back as if his thoughts flew to the sky nine thousand miles high. Tears welled up in his eyes as he continued to recite.
1:19:18|1:19:33|After reciting these two lines of poetry, a tear suddenly fell from the corner of his eye. He lifted his pen and continued writing behind [Gao Lishi]. [Li Bai]'s sometimes crazy and sometimes frantic state attracted many guests to watch. Finally, with a big stroke of his pen, he said to [Gao Lishi].
1:19:37|1:19:43|Li Bai threw his brush into the wine pool.
1:19:50|1:19:54|After finishing speaking, he left [Gao Lishi] aside and leaned against a rock to sleep, soon snoring loudly.
1:19:55|1:20:8|On this side, [Bai Letian] and [Kong Hai] have also found the Huaye Xianghui Building 30 years later. Time flies, and the once magnificent palace has now become overgrown with weeds and deserted.
1:20:8|1:20:17|The two pushed open the long-sealed door, searching around the hall. Finally, [Kong Hai] found something in the dried-up Taiye Pool and quickly called [Bai Letian] over.
1:20:19|1:20:26|It's a broken pen. [Bai Letian] carefully picked it up and showed it to [Kong Hai] excitedly, tears welling up in his eyes.
1:20:34|1:20:46|In his dream, [Li Bai] was awakened by [Gao Lishi]. In a daze, he suddenly realized that Yang Yuhuan was approaching him, which startled him. Fortunately, Yuhuan didn't mind [Li Bai]'s disheveled appearance and instead spoke to him gently.
1:21:25|1:21:32|The concubine was not angry, but instead walked over to him to remind him. It was when Li Bai was putting on his shoes.
1:21:43|1:21:48|Li Bai was stunned by the Empress's praise, watching her departing figure, Li Bai suddenly recited the poem he had just written.
1:22:36|1:22:41|The bright moon was already hanging high in the sky at some point, and in the blink of an eye, the feast of bliss was coming to an end.
1:22:42|1:22:50|At this moment, the Empress is accompanying the Emperor in the waterside pavilion by the lake, practicing calligraphy away from the bustling banquet, enjoying the wonderful time together.
1:22:51|1:22:59|The moment was interrupted by the sudden visit of [Abe Nakamaro], causing the Emperor to stop his pen and look at [Abe Nakamaro] in surprise, creating a tense atmosphere.
1:23:41|1:23:58|The Emperor put down his pen, walked up to [Yang Yuhuan], grabbed her shoulder, and looked at her face. [Abe Nakamaro] watched the Emperor gaze at [Yang Yuhuan] with such affection, feeling a myriad of emotions but not knowing where to begin.
1:25:1|1:25:9|The emperor drummed vigorously and engaged in combat with An Lushan, who wielded a curved knife. Everyone was worried that he would be injured by An Lushan, but he remained indifferent.
1:25:18|1:25:26|Indeed, An Lushan did not harm the emperor at all, but engaged in a passionate martial arts battle with His Majesty. The feast of extreme joy came to an end in such revelry.
1:25:29|1:25:45|The scene shifts to 30 years later, where [Bai Letian] and [Kong Hai] are following the diary of [Abe Nakamaro] to continue exploring the truth of the past. They row a boat to Yanqiu Gate, and before the boat even stops, [Bai Letian] excitedly runs ashore. Standing in front of Yanqiu Gate, he points ahead and says to [Kong Hai].
1:25:59|1:26:15|Following the direction pointed by [Bai Letian], the time has once again returned to 30 years ago. In the distant sky, billowing smoke filled the air, soldiers with long spears in hand were fleeing with their families from all directions, among them was Emperor Li Longji.
1:26:15|1:26:22|Who would have thought that the proud emperor at the feast of paradise would only last for ten days and then flee from the imperial palace in such a sorry state.
1:26:22|1:26:40|Walking forward with the support of the guards, he suddenly stopped for no apparent reason, remained silent for a while, then slapped the hat off the guard next to him. The guard quickly bowed in a gesture of apology, but he knew in his heart that the emperor was venting his anger on him.
1:26:41|1:26:50|This sentence is both addressed to the 100,000 soldiers and to oneself. Finally, they arrived at Ma Wei Inn overnight.
1:27:5|1:27:24|At this moment, the Emperor is standing on the dilapidated city wall, looking at the soldiers in the distance. Upon hearing the report from [Huang He], he slowly turns around, his gaze sharp, and as soon as he enters the room, he gives orders to the guards. With one command from the Emperor, the guards opened all the doors.
1:27:24|1:27:42|[Master Gao Lishi] was seen briskly walking towards the emperor with a plate in his hands, which he soon placed in front of the emperor. The emperor lifted the red silk cloth, revealing the blackened head of [Yang Yuhuan]. [Master Gao Lishi] forced himself to remain calm and continued to convey the message.
1:27:59|1:28:3|Abe Nakamaro behind him hurried forward when he heard the conversation between the two.
1:28:7|1:28:18|Abe approached the Emperor and whispered something. The Emperor looked towards the direction of the Empress upstairs, his eyes filled with sadness but a hint of a smile at the corner of his mouth.
1:28:21|1:28:26|The emperor turned around and asked [Huang He] to leave the hall. Abe, unwilling to give up, decided to try his luck and headed towards the direction of the second floor where the concubines were.
1:28:27|1:28:39|At this moment, she was sitting on a broken chair, quietly listening to Bai Long playing music. Hearing footsteps, she suddenly turned her head and noticed Abe.
1:28:42|1:28:48|She agreed to Abe's request, and the two of them moved to the side.
1:28:56|1:29:3|She remained silent for a moment before turning around and saying.
1:29:13|1:29:40|Instead of meeting Abe's gaze, she slowly walked past him. Just as the Emperor said, he lost. [Yang Yuhuan] rejected his plea. Abe said no more, bowed and turned to leave. Suddenly, [Yang Yuhuan] called out to him, tears welling in her eyes.
1:31:50|1:32:11|When everyone was at a loss, [Huang He] presented a plan to the emperor. In front of everyone, he ordered [Dan Long] to lie on a stone slab, then took out a silver needle and inserted it into [Dan Long]'s neck. Soon, [Dan Long] fell into a deep sleep, as if dead. [Huang He] explained to everyone.
1:33:10|1:33:16|While the Emperor was talking to [Yang Yuhuan], [Huang He] pulled out the silver needle from the neck of [Dan Long], and Dan Long's eyelids immediately twitched.
1:33:19|1:33:31|Huang He said that Dan Long could indeed get up after speaking, but he fell to the ground before taking a few steps. Bai Long quickly helped Dan Long up. Huang He explained to everyone.
1:33:35|1:33:41|Although Huang He said there was no major problem, Bai Long had some doubts in his heart. At this moment, Gao Lishi hurriedly offered his advice.
1:33:58|1:34:9|In the distance, a long sobbing sound could be heard. [Yang Yuhuan] looked at the Emperor expressionlessly. The Emperor dared not look at her, avoiding her gaze and softly asking [Huang He].
1:34:13|1:34:20|Huang He's response was like a reassuring needle, the emperor walked up to Yang Yuhuan.
1:34:36|1:34:52|[Bai Long] heard their discussion and immediately stepped forward to stop everyone. However, [Huang He] unexpectedly struck his left leg heavily with a stick, causing him to lean against a stone slab. He hoped [Yang Yuhuan] would resist her fate, but she seemed to be a bystander, calmly watching everything.
1:34:59|1:35:13|[Kong Hai] was convinced that they were going to bury the noble consort alive, which [Bai Letian] couldn't accept. While 30 years ago, [Yang Yuhuan] looked at the man she loved in front of her and just made a soft sound of agreement, even trying to force a smile.
1:35:13|1:35:22|After obtaining her consent, the Emperor immediately poured her a glass of wine. Without any hesitation, she picked up the glass and drank it all in one gulp before turning and heading upstairs.
1:35:23|1:35:36|Just as she took a few steps, she suddenly stopped, as if remembering something. She took out a sachet embroidered with the words "Jade Slave" from her sleeve and handed it to the Emperor. Her gaze followed the sachet to the Emperor, then to the crowd, filled with love and reluctance.
1:35:36|1:35:49|She immediately withdrew her gaze, afraid that if she looked for too long, she would no longer be willing to accept her fate.
1:35:59|1:36:18|Just like she's dead, [Yang Yuhuan] lies on the cold stone slab, just as the old lady said, she looks like she's asleep, even more beautiful than when she was awake. Looking at her body, [Huang He] asks [Gao Lishi].
1:36:32|1:36:36|Huang He finished speaking and Gao Lishi pointed at him anxiously.
1:36:43|1:37:2|[Gao Lishi] turned around, intending to plead with the Emperor for justice. However, when he saw the Emperor's expression, he knew that it was actually the Emperor's intention, so he had to bow his head and remain silent. The next morning, the commander of the Jinwu Guard, [Chen Xuanli], who is [Chen Yunqiao]'s father, was summoned to examine the body of [Yang Yuhuan].
1:37:2|1:37:12|He walked into the dilapidated palace where the emperor resided at the moment, holding his sword, under the gaze of thousands of generals. The tiles did not shield the rain, the walls did not block the wind, and the floor beneath his feet creaked, with the possibility of collapse at any moment.
1:37:13|1:37:30|He arrived on the second floor under the gaze of [Bai Long] and [Dan Long]. There lay [Yang Yuhuan] in a long dress, peacefully on the stone slab, as if she had not yet woken up. He couldn't help but admire her beauty and at the same time doubted her death. He glanced at [Dan Long] and [Bai Long] who were accompanying the noble consort.
1:37:30|1:37:37|Just then, the screams of [Gao Lishi] came from downstairs.
1:37:39|1:37:50|He looked in the direction of the sound and saw that the Emperor was beating [Gao Lishi] with a stick. Each strike made [Gao Lishi] roll on the ground. Amidst [Gao Lishi]'s cries,
1:37:59|1:38:4|Finally, after repeated strikes, Gao Lishi fell unconscious, leaving Tang Xuanzong stunned by the scene before him.
1:38:11|1:38:28|Emperor [Tang Xuanzong] was taken aback by the scene and panicked. He rushed downstairs, threw away his sword, and knelt in front of the Emperor, embracing his legs, begging for forgiveness.
1:38:37|1:38:44|He hysterically roared at [Master Konghai].
1:39:9|1:39:17|The rebellion ended with the death of [Yang Yuhuan].
1:39:56|1:40:4|Accompanied by the mournful meowing, the door of the ancient tomb was shut heavily, and [Bai Letian] stared blankly, asking with sadness in his voice, "Why is it raining so heavily?"
1:41:0|1:41:16|[Kong Hai] wanted to find the tomb of [Yang Yuhuan], so the two followed the clues left in [Abe Nakamaro]'s diary and crossed a forest in the water, and sure enough, they found an ancient tomb. Just as [Bai Letian] arrived at the entrance, a large group of flies swarmed out, and [Kong Hai] behind him decisively said.
1:41:28|1:41:40|Just as the two were puzzled about why the stone door was opened, the eyes of the stone statue on the wall suddenly moved. [Bai Letian] sensed something was wrong, so he quickly ran to the statue to check, but found nothing unusual. He was scared and hurried to call [Master Konghai].
1:42:6|1:42:14|The coffin was empty, and [Bai Letian] excitedly said to [Kong Hai].
1:42:18|1:42:23|Just as [Bai Letian] was getting excited, [Kong Hai] suddenly lay down in the coffin, leaving [Bai Letian] puzzled as he asked him.
1:42:33|1:42:43|Watching the determined look in [Kong Hai]'s eyes, [Bai Letian] had no choice but to follow suit. He struggled to close the coffin, leaving [Kong Hai] alone inside. Holding up a candle, [Kong Hai] carefully examined as if he had discovered something, suddenly a sound came from inside the coffin.
1:42:43|1:42:55|The sound of heavy blows. This scared Bai Letian outside the coffin, he exerted all his strength to finally push open the coffin lid, Kong Hai rushed out from inside, and then quickly hid behind the stone coffin.
1:42:56|1:43:13|He, who was puzzled, came to [Kong Hai] with a lantern and suddenly found that [Kong Hai] was crying at this moment. [Kong Hai] immediately avoided his gaze, turned his back and pushed the coffin lid. Without asking too much, [Bai Letian] had to help him push it together. The coffin lid was overturned to the ground by the two of them, revealing streaks of blood inside.
1:43:24|1:43:32|Both [Bai Letian] and [Kong Hai] cried as they looked at the bloodstains on the stone coffin lid.
1:43:33|1:43:49|The two looked in the direction of the sound and saw that the demon cat had also appeared in the ancient tomb at some point. The demon cat spoke as it jumped onto a coffin. Without answering Kong Hai's question, Bai Letian asked at this moment.
1:44:5|1:44:21|Listening to the narration of the demon cat, [Bai Letian] and [Master Konghai] were already in tears. At this moment, the demon cat turned around, and following its gaze, the two saw the scene of [Bai Long] limping with a torch, and [Dan Long] entering the ancient tomb 30 years ago.
1:44:21|1:44:32|They hurried forward, and after Bai Letian, Kong Hai, Bai Long, and Dan Long crossed gazes across time and space, Bai Letian finally realized that this was just another illusion created by the demon cat.
1:44:41|1:44:51|Just as [Bai Long] and [Dan Long] approached [Bai Letian] and [Kong Hai], the illusion of the young [Huang He] suddenly disappeared, and at this moment, a hint of sadness appeared on the face of the demon cat.
1:44:52|1:44:58|[Bai Letian] and [Kong Hai] are searching everywhere for the missing [Bai He] youth. At this moment, the demon cat behind them speaks again.
1:45:15|1:45:21|The demon cat once again uses illusion, and the scene returns to 30 years ago. Inside the ancient tomb, [Yang Yuhuan] lies covered in blood.
1:45:22|1:45:39|Bai Long and Dan Long looked at each other in shock, without much time to think. Bai Long quickly pulled Yang Yuhuan out of the tomb, and the illusion disappeared. The demon cat jumped in front of the two, Bai Letian asked excitedly. The demon cat did not answer.
1:45:41|1:45:56|The scene shifts to a waterfall hanging on the edge of a cliff, with a cave on the side of the cliff, where [Bai Long] is hiding [Yang Yuhuan]. [Bai Long] carefully feeds water to [Yang Yuhuan] with tree leaves, and behind him, [Dan Long] can't bear it and steps forward to speak.
1:47:39|1:47:47|After Bai Long finished speaking, he dragged his left foot and turned to walk into the cave. Dan Long called out to Bai Long from behind.
1:48:0|1:48:12|[Bai Long] looked at [Yang Yuhuan] lying on the stone bed and answered confidently. When [Kong Hai] inquired about [Dan Long], the demon cat showed a look of loss, and the scene returned to 30 years ago.
1:48:28|1:48:37|After [Dan Long] bid farewell to [Bai Long] in the sunset, the white crane youth was never seen in this world again.
1:48:38|1:48:42|[Bai Long] returned to the cave disappointedly, staring blankly at the body of [Yang Yuhuan] for a long time.
1:48:43|1:48:48|He knew that in this world, besides the corpse of [Yang Yuhuan], there was still that royal cat that could accompany him.
1:48:49|1:48:58|Seeing this, [Kong Hai] couldn't help but want to comfort the cat demon in front of him with his hand, but the demon cat was not grateful and turned away after leaving claw marks on [Kong Hai]'s hand.
1:49:0|1:49:19|Kong Hai did not blame the demon cat, because he knew it carried too much bitterness in its heart. Kong Hai further approached to ask about what happened next. Later, Yang Yuhuan's body began to decay, just like what had happened to Yu Lian at that time.
1:49:19|1:49:34|This really scared Bai Long. He nervously checked Yang Yuhuan's body and, upon seeing her festering wound, couldn't help but touch it. To his surprise, he was bitten by the insects inside.
1:49:35|1:49:50|[Bai Long] needed a piece of raw meat, so he looked at the imperial cat next to him and pulled out a dagger. The imperial cat seemed to sense its fate and closed its eyes. As [Bai Long]'s knife slowly approached the cat, at the last moment, [Bai Long] softened his heart and put away the dagger.
1:49:51|1:50:8|Suddenly he felt like there were worms wriggling in his hand. Oh no, he realized he had just touched the body of [Yang Yuhuan], he was also poisoned. He panicked and stood up, his survival instinct told him to leave quickly to find fresh meat, maybe he could still survive. But as he was about to leave, what about [Yang Yuhuan]?
1:50:8|1:50:17|Finally, he made a bold decision, taking out a dagger to cut open the skin of [Yang Yuhuan], and then using his mouth to suck out the worms on her body.
1:50:18|1:50:40|It turns out that [Bai Long] was using his own body as live bait to draw out the gu worms in [Yang Yuhuan]'s body. After a heart-wrenching scream from [Bai Long], the gu poison in [Yang Yuhuan] finally disappeared. He excitedly reached out to touch [Yang Yuhuan]'s face, only to find that his hand had already decayed.
1:50:40|1:50:55|He quickly tore open his shirt in fear, his body already gnawed by the insects until it was a bloody mess. Looking at his decaying body, he was extremely scared, but he only had one thought in his mind.
1:50:59|1:51:15|A strong wind blew, causing [Bai Long] to be bitten painfully by the venomous insects. Looking at Yumao, he realized that in order to survive and continue to accompany [Yang Yuhuan], he had to give up his own body. So he decided to discard his youthful body and transfer his soul into Yumao's body.
1:51:18|1:51:32|It seems that Bai Letian sensed the deep love for Yang Yuhuan behind his crazy behavior. So Bai Letian willingly came to his side, and they together completed this soul's journey. Bai Long succeeded.
1:51:32|1:51:42|He infused his soul into the body of the Imperial Cat, and from then on, the graceful and handsome youth [Bai Long] no longer existed in this world, nor did the Imperial Cat. They merged into one and became the present-day Demon Cat.
1:51:42|1:52:2|The demon cat approached [Bai Long], touched him with its claws, still holding hope that [Bai Long] would wake up, but there was no response. He turned into a lifeless body lying quietly on the ground. The demon cat stared at [Bai Long] with tears in its eyes. Upon hearing his narration, [Master Konghai] said sadly.
1:52:18|1:52:51|With a rush of water, [Bai Long]'s body was carried downstream into the water, as he stood at the edge of the cliff looking on, bidding farewell to his physical form. He turned back into the cave, continuing to accompany [Yang Yuhuan] day and night. How he wished the woman before him could wake up, could ask again. Unfortunately, he never heard it again.
1:53:13|1:53:28|He longed to help [Yang Yuhuan] open the heavy lid on the stone tomb, but he couldn't do it. He could only listen to [Yang Yuhuan]'s desperate screams over and over again. He was furious, he roared, and finally decided to seek revenge on Emperor [Tang Xuanzong].
1:53:28|1:53:40|The demon cat arrived at the Seven Star Pavilion. At this moment, the Emperor was looking at the final token left to him by [Yang Yuhuan], the sachet containing her hair. His reverie was interrupted by a cat's cry.
1:53:40|1:53:52|He has aged, his back is no longer as straight as before, his hair has turned white. He finally recognized that this was his imperial cat, hurried forward, and ended up slipping on the stairs by accident.
1:53:54|1:54:0|The emperor awkwardly lay on the stairs and asked the imperial cat, who immediately jumped in front of the emperor. The emperor then touched the cat's head and asked again.
1:54:14|1:54:37|He was extremely frightened, quickly got up, and stared at the demon cat, which also stared back at him. Terrified, he tried to escape by crawling away, but how could an old man escape from a demon cat? With a gentle leap, the demon cat pounced on the emperor. It bared its claws and scratched at the emperor's eyes, leaving him blind.
1:54:37|1:54:45|Hearing the emperor's screams of agony, the demon cat gleefully completed the first step of revenge. It turned out the emperor was blinded by the demon cat, and upon hearing the truth, Bai Letian was in a panic.
1:55:38|1:55:50|Faced with the roar of [Bai Letian], the demon cat just weakly responded and then left. The words of [Kong Hai] made it pause, but it did not answer, and finally it left with its head drooping.
1:55:51|1:56:3|It returned to the cave at the cliff edge in a daze, and as it reached the entrance, it seemed to see [Yang Yuhuan] standing elegantly under the cherry blossom tree, smiling. It was extremely excited, too overwhelmed to consider if this was real.
1:56:4|1:56:11|It rushes towards [Yang Yuhuan]. One step, two steps, then a leap, at this moment it only wants to fall into [Yang Yuhuan]'s arms, gently comforting her.
1:56:12|1:56:16|When it touched [Yang Yuhuan], she disappeared.
1:56:18|1:56:31|It let out a mournful cry, the sound echoing for a long time at the edge of the cliff. Suddenly, it rushed into the cave, and [Yang Yuhuan] was gone, she was actually gone, leaving only the jade hairpin picked up by [Bai Long] at the feast of paradise, and then disappeared.
1:56:31|1:56:42|The demon cat felt sorrow, anger, pain, and despair. All emotions surged up at once, and it let out a long roar towards the sky, then spat out a mouthful of blood.
1:56:42|1:56:51|The next morning, a watermelon and a box appeared in front of Master Konghai's house. Bai Letian picked up the watermelon, while Kong Hai held the box. The two of them entered the house, expressing their confusion.
1:56:54|1:57:6|[Bai Letian] was very puzzled, so he opened the box placed on the table by [Master Konghai]. Inside the box was a piece of paper with only four words written on it: "Feast of Paradise".
1:57:7|1:57:14|The two pushed open the door of the Huixi Building as agreed, and as soon as the door opened, they saw the [Demon Cat] crouching at the entrance.
1:57:18|1:57:27|Just as [Bai Letian] lazily stretched his ribs, a bright light suddenly appeared behind him, accompanied by joyful voices in his ears. In an instant, they were transported back to the magnificent and splendid feast of paradise 30 years ago.
1:57:27|1:57:43|[Bai Letian] was extremely excited as he watched the guests frolicking in front of him, dancers performing aerial dances, and the Taiye Pool filled with 7000 catties of fine wine. [Yang Yuhuan] and [Tang Xuanzong] were caressing the imperial cat while chatting and laughing, and the spirited young Baihe was chasing around in the hall.
1:57:45|1:57:58|Chasing and playing. The [Demon Cat] is leaping around in the hall, wanting to carefully examine each frame, wanting to return to the feast of paradise 30 years ago. [Bai Letian] is also pleasantly surprised by each frame before him. In the crowd, he finally sees that arrogant and unruly poetic immortal [Li Bai].
1:57:58|1:58:8|He saw him lying next to Taiye Pool, drinking wine leisurely with his legs crossed, and he also saw [Yang Yuhuan] looking back and saying that to [Li Bai].
1:58:27|1:58:36|The scene of the feast in paradise suddenly disappeared.
1:58:59|1:59:12|Following Guaweng's gaze, passing through the now overgrown and desolate Taiye Pool, on a stone slab lies the body of [Yang Yuhuan], lying peacefully. [Bai Letian] immediately ran over.
1:59:12|1:59:28|He finally saw Yang Yuhuan, the woman who haunted his dreams, appearing before his eyes. Just as the old lady had said. Bai Letian ran up to Kong Hai almost in tears, asking.
1:59:57|2:0:6|The demon cat stared at its own body and the imperial concubine for a long time, tears welling up in its eyes.
2:0:19|2:0:38|Kong Hai's words awakened the demon cat, and it finally admitted that Yang Yuhuan was dead, and its obsession was completely shattered.
2:0:39|2:0:55|The old man lying on the ground begged the demon cat to kill him, but the demon cat showed its claws and then retracted them, choosing not to kill him. At that moment, it let go of its desire for revenge, turned around, and walked past the feet of [Bai Letian] and [Kong Hai], because it didn't want them to see the tears in its eyes.
2:0:55|2:1:12|It slowly walked towards [Yang Yuhuan], no longer the demon cat that had harmed countless people, but just an ordinary cat. Gasping for breath, it finally reached the edge of the stone slab. It leaped, trying to jump to the side of the noble consort, but it had no strength left and fell down.
2:1:12|2:1:27|It refused to accept defeat and jumped again, only to fall even harder, rolling several meters away. It lay on the ground gasping for breath, barely clinging to life. [Bai Letian] and [Kong Hai] quickly rushed to its side. Looking at the two, the demon cat finally spoke its mind.
2:1:29|2:1:44|The two of them looked at it sorrowfully, when suddenly a crane's cry came from above. The demon cat struggled for its last breath, lifted its head to see the [Huang He]. It kept hovering in the dome of the palace, flapping its wings and shuttling in the golden sunlight.
2:1:45|2:2:7|Gazing at the sudden appearance of the White Crane, the three individuals had different expressions. Bai Letian was puzzled, Kong Hai was relieved, while Guaweng clasped his hands together devoutly as he looked at it. The demon cat lying on the ground seemed to be influenced, as it lifted its head and stared at the White Crane flying in the sky for a long time, then quietly closed its eyes and peacefully fell to the ground.
2:2:7|2:2:18|Under their gaze, [Bai He] flew higher and higher, disappearing into the sunlight. It flew away, taking the soul of the demon cat with it.
2:2:19|2:2:33|When Bai Letian and Kong Hai regained consciousness, they found that the demon cat lying on the ground had already breathed its last breath, and strangely, the body of Bai Long had also disappeared. Kong Hai picked up the demon cat's body and gently placed it next to Yang Yuhuan's body.
2:2:33|2:2:52|The story of the 30-year-old demon cat and [Yang Yuhuan] came to an end. The next day, [Bai Letian] and [Kong Hai] walked once again on the bustling streets of Chang'an, and [Kong Hai] said.
2:3:16|2:3:32|[Bai Letian] finally confirmed his "Changhen Ge" without changing a word. The two soon arrived at a tavern, where [Bai Letian] drank it all in one gulp. Unable to resist, [Kong Hai] spoke up.
2:3:41|2:3:46|[Master Konghai] put down the wine in his hand, watching [Bai Letian] disappear into the crowd, and gave a heartfelt praise.
2:3:47|2:4:8|The ruthless and unscrupulous [Bai Letian] is now walking towards the sunset on the head of Chang'an Bridge, finally dispelling the shadows in his heart and no longer living under the shadow of [Li Bai]. The bell of the Great Blue Dragon Temple rings again, and [Master Konghai] comes to the temple again before parting.
2:4:14|2:4:30|He entered the Great Blue Dragon Temple as he wished, where the monks stood humbly with their hands clasped together on both sides of the hall. In the center stood a towering Arhat with a distinctive expression. After passing through the hall and exchanging greetings with the monks who welcomed him in the inner hall, the monk said.
2:4:34|2:4:52|[Master Konghai], with a look of doubt, bid farewell to the monk and came alone to the staircase. The staircase was just behind a golden Buddha over 10 meters high. As he reached the second floor, Master Huiguo appeared behind him. Sensing someone behind him, [Konghai] stopped in his tracks, and the master stepped forward, gazing at [Konghai]'s back, and asked.
2:4:54|2:4:58|[Master Konghai] smiled knowingly, indeed Master Huiguo is [Dan Long], he turned around.
2:5:2|2:5:8|He took out the box that Master Konghai left at their doorstep last time, with "Feast of Paradise" written on it.
