0:0:26|0:0:37|The family has a total of thirteen members, and today is the annual New Year's Day. [Uncle Cheng] has been traveling outside for half a year, and he returns home full of joy to reunite with his family.
0:0:37|0:0:47|The children and grandchildren didn't start coming home until the first day of the Lunar New Year. They thought they could finally enjoy a happy reunion dinner with the family, but one unpleasant incident after another occurred.
0:0:48|0:0:59|Father and Mother also lost interest in celebrating the New Year. Everyone kept talking about money, and the reunion dinner that only happened once a year ended in embarrassment and awkwardness.
0:0:59|0:1:10|The scene of breaking up without spending money has always haunted [Father], so one day after the farce, he and his wife flew away, leaving the home where they had lived for a lifetime.
0:1:13|0:1:23|The [Big Brother] of the elderly couple idolized Teacher Muna since childhood, but ended up with a fierce and domineering daughter-in-law. Although [Second Sister's Husband] is a well-known official, he finds it hard to change his habit of being flirtatious.
0:1:23|0:1:32|There is [Second Sister], who was once determined to marry a man with status, causing a lot of trouble at home. The couple now supports themselves and live a peaceful life.
0:1:33|0:1:46|But the worst was yet to come. His [Younger Son] indulged in all kinds of pleasures without working, and even found a girlfriend who was also unemployed and notorious. All she did every day was ask for money and seek pleasure.
0:1:46|0:1:55|[Father] and [Mother] recalled the scene of last year's New Year's Eve dinner, with [Sister-in-law] angrily smashing a mirror, everyone else arguing loudly, and the dinner ending in an unhappy manner.
0:1:56|0:2:7|Chinese families may be the most intriguing, a reality that people are reluctant to admit but have to face. The annual reunion dinner is also a mirror reflecting the essence of a Chinese family.
0:2:7|0:2:25|At the dining table, behind the filial piety of [Father] and the mutual love between brothers, is actually a group of relatives who have been at odds with each other for generations. Fortunately, not all families are like this. After watching this movie, you will have a deeper understanding of the rural folk life in China after the reform and opening up.
0:2:26|0:2:40|Actress [Zhao Lirong] won the Best Actress award at the 4th Tokyo International Film Festival and the 15th Hundred Flowers Awards for this film. Even though it was filmed in the 1990s, it is still considered a classic today.
0:2:42|0:2:59|At the beginning of the story, in the bustling market, the crowd is noisy, with people everywhere shopping for New Year goods. A woman is rushing home, panting heavily, her face tired, dragging a cart full of meat and other New Year goods behind her. She can't move it alone, so there are helpful children pushing the goods behind her.
0:3:8|0:3:14|The sound of bargaining in the market seemed out of place, with smiles on everyone's faces around.
0:3:16|0:3:33|The woman is [Mrs. Cheng], with the children following behind her, exerting all their strength to help her push the cart. She awkwardly opens her wallet while walking towards home. As soon as [Mrs. Cheng] arrives home, there is the elderly [Father] of the Cheng family, welcoming her back.
0:3:34|0:3:53|He skied down the snow-covered mountain with a hunched back, free and easy. This was his first time returning home after more than half a year away. This time, he brought a pile of New Year goods with his homemade climbing pear, ready to celebrate the New Year with his children. [Uncle Jiancheng] stumbled down the high snow slope, and the two lanterns after the climbing pear swayed in the wind.
0:3:53|0:3:56|He cheered himself on as he descended the mountain.
0:4:3|0:4:10|Even though he fired a shot, he still burst into laughter. Dragging the pear tree, he was almost home when he heard a burst of fast-paced clapping coming from the courtyard.
0:4:28|0:4:52|It turned out that there were three or five comic actors trying to please the audience. I saw [Middle-aged Woman] reluctantly take out a five yuan note from her small cloth bag. She then took out a ten yuan note.
0:5:8|0:5:20|He didn't know that [Uncle Cheng] was already at the doorstep, when a familiar voice came from not far away. As he turned his head, all the wrinkles on his face relaxed at once, it turned out that [Uncle Cheng] had returned.
0:5:34|0:5:47|Uncle Cheng raised his hand and put it back on, his eyes full of indulgence. Uncle Cheng took out the prepared silver goods.
0:5:53|0:6:18|[Mrs. Cheng] asked in confusion. Then, [Mrs. Cheng] turned around and added another sentence. [Mr. Cheng] looked disdainful. He then packed up the New Year goods. He awkwardly unloaded a bicycle from the pear tree, his face filled with disappointment and anger, and asked.
0:6:27|0:6:32|[Mother] walked back home in a daze.
0:6:48|0:7:1|The two of them just arrived, making an appearance. As the sky darkens, on the kitchen table is the New Year's Eve dinner already prepared by [Mrs. Cheng]. [Mr. Cheng] sits alone at the table, lost in thought, with his eyes downcast, seemingly uninterested in this meal.
0:7:1|0:7:10|Father Cheng didn't start by picking up the chopsticks to taste the New Year's Eve dinner, but instead picked up a bottle of wine first, filling up the glasses for the two of them while talking.
0:7:19|0:7:31|Chen [Father] was both surprised and delighted. The couple exchanged a smile.
0:7:43|0:7:54|After a moment, the atmosphere suddenly quieted down, and the faces of the elderly couple darkened. To ease the awkward silence, Cheng [Father] smiled and set the wine aside.
0:8:26|0:8:42|Mother Cheng looked gloomy, followed by Father Cheng speaking. In the darkness, Father Cheng finished his drink in one gulp. The dishes on the table seemed untouched, but Father Cheng had already had several glasses. Mother Cheng watched her husband drinking alone, with a serious expression.
0:8:52|0:9:7|The wine glass was placed down, and the two of them sat in silence facing each other. Outside the window, colorful fireworks lit up the sky, making the house feel even more desolate. As the fireworks burst in the sky, inside the house were the silent elderly couple, locked in a gaze. At that moment, Father chuckled, clutching his stomach.
0:9:9|0:9:24|On one side, he carefully untied the tightly wrapped clothing package, revealing several stacks of thick banknotes inside, totaling about 100,000 yuan. He took out all the banknotes with a rather imposing manner, Father placed the banknotes on the table, one stack, two stacks, three stacks.
0:9:25|0:9:29|This is all his hard-earned money from the past half year, already occupying the entire table.
0:9:30|0:9:42|[Mrs. Cheng] looked terrified and puzzled, never having seen so much money before, feeling at a loss. [Mr. Cheng] held a stack of banknotes in his hand, with a contemptuous look, as if he didn't consider the money as money.
0:9:42|0:9:57|He smiled warmly, while [Mrs. Cheng] remained silent on the side. He then pushed all the money directly in front of [Mrs. Cheng]. With hands that showed signs of aging over the years, it was clear that they had weathered many hardships. Seeing the dilemma on his wife's face, [Father Cheng] spoke up.
0:10:0|0:10:16|At this moment, Cheng's [Mother] completely couldn't hold back anymore. Her brows furrowed, and a tear suddenly flashed in her eyes that had been weathered by wind and sun for years, with deep wrinkles etched into her skin and sagging cheeks forming distinct laugh lines. Faced with this situation, she choked up, and with difficulty, squeezed out a few words.
0:10:26|0:10:39|As soon as the words fell, she began to cry loudly, wiping away a few tears with one hand covering her face. Perhaps thinking of the home she had been guarding alone for most of the year, she finally saw a glimmer of hope. Seeing her like this, Cheng [Father] softly comforted her.
0:10:46|0:10:51|Mother Cheng's chin slightly tucked in at this moment, and her sense of grievance reached its peak in an instant.
0:11:1|0:11:12|The couple remained silent, but their hearts were like clear mirrors. Seeing this, Cheng [Father] took out a matchbox to light a cigarette, while the steam rising from the burning firewood behind him continued to surge in the darkness.
0:11:12|0:11:20|With a flick and a puff, the smooth and continuous movements were no different from an old smoker, the drifting smoke rings floating in the air, [Mrs. Cheng]'s face slowly becoming blurred.
0:11:21|0:11:38|Amidst the swirling smoke, tears streamed down [Mother Cheng]'s face, her brows furrowed in anguish and confusion. Sensing her distress, [Father Cheng] gestured for her to take a puff as well. [Mother Cheng] took the cigarette, expertly blowing smoke rings. [Father Cheng] asked, and [Mother Cheng] nodded cautiously.
0:11:44|0:11:55|He saw only a few circles of smoke lingering, and handed the cigarette back to [Uncle Cheng]. At this moment, [Uncle Cheng] appeared profound and serene. In no time, a single sentence brought the two back from their reverie to reality.
0:12:3|0:12:11|[Mrs. Cheng] looked fearful and conflicted, avoiding her husband's gaze, while [Mr. Cheng] remained silent, just taking a deep drag of his cigarette.
0:12:14|0:12:25|At this moment, firecrackers and the noise of children could be heard outside the window. In the rural northeast, they would also smash bowls filled with coins, symbolizing a safe and prosperous year ahead. The children would then rush to grab the coins.
0:12:25|0:12:37|However, the hustle and bustle outside the window seemed unrelated to [Father] and [Mother]. Inside their own home, [Big Brother] is helping [Sister-in-law] with cupping therapy. Perhaps due to the biting cold, [Sister-in-law]'s rheumatism has flared up again, as she is seen wrapping a blanket around her exposed body.
0:12:38|0:12:44|[Big Brother] lit the cotton ball and quickly pulled the can off his back, forming craters of various sizes in no time.
0:12:52|0:12:56|Still talking while not forgetting to tap the fire pot, checking it.
0:12:57|0:13:8|[Sister-in-law]'s helpless response made [Big Brother] look even more guilty, after all, it was his departure that left all the heavy burden on [Sister-in-law] alone.
0:13:8|0:13:16|Perhaps due to the tacit understanding between husband and wife, [Sister-in-law] sensed his self-blame. He slightly turned his head to signal to [Big Brother] that everything would be fine.
0:13:17|0:13:35|Shortly after, [Big Brother] draped a blanket over [Sister-in-law], and the two of them leaned on each other affectionately, their eyes full of tenderness and sorrow. The wrinkles on [Big Brother]'s forehead were tightly pressed into lines, as the festive atmosphere outside the window grew stronger. [Big Brother] invited [Sister-in-law] to go out and take a look together, so [Sister-in-law] reluctantly walked out onto the street.
0:13:35|0:13:39|The scene is filled with children happily playing with fireworks everywhere.
0:14:9|0:14:11|On the road, they encountered a young man selling fireworks.
0:14:43|0:14:58|In the open space around, a group of spirited children gathered, all waiting for the centerpiece firework to appear. [Father] stood in the center of the crowd, as the firework ignited, he was the most eye-catching figure at that moment. As the firework lit up, the children all excitedly jumped up.
0:15:4|0:15:11|As the fireworks faded away and the children's cheers dissipated, the next morning arrived in an instant.
0:15:11|0:15:24|The first light of dawn brought this small town closer and farther away, the sky no longer so clear, with a thin mist enveloping the ever-changing tree trunks. Through the gaps between the mist, the mountains, forests, and buildings only revealed a faint sunlight.
0:15:25|0:15:39|There is no festive atmosphere like during the New Year, no lively banter, and the outdoors are already covered in thick ice that can be used as a natural refrigerator. At the entrance of the [Cheng family], the neatly arranged cured meat is very eye-catching.
0:15:39|0:15:48|Inside the house, [Mother] is busy making dumplings, rolling out the dough, preparing the ingredients, and mixing the meat filling. These complex operations and procedures require time to accumulate and settle.
0:15:48|0:16:5|The rolled dumpling wrappers are as thin as cicada wings, with the meat filling gently wrapped inside. Using a bit of water on the edges of the wrapper, [Father] carefully pinches them together with just the right amount of pressure to form beautiful round dumplings. Meanwhile, [Father] is smoking a cigarette, watching [Mother] bustling around tirelessly.
0:16:16|0:16:20|Uncle Cheng took a puff of his cigarette and chatted with his children.
0:16:54|0:17:12|Yes, as soon as you planned me, the first figure returning home was seen on the hillside in front of the house. The first to return home were Second Son [Cheng Yuan] and his new girlfriend [Tian Ge]. [Cheng Yuan] got into a graduate program in Beijing, and this time he brought his girlfriend home for the Chinese New Year.
0:17:12|0:17:23|The wide ten-mile long street, with [Tian Ge] and [Cheng Yuan] sitting behind the carriage, not far from the hillside, is the newly built villa of the [Cheng family]. [Cheng Yuan] pointed in the direction of the house, proudly telling [Tian Ge].
0:17:36|0:17:50|[Tian Ge] is dressed very stylishly, wearing a fur hat and holding the latest camera, taking photos of a villa not far away. [Tian Ge] is full of smiles and anticipation, and [Cheng Yuan] sees the newly renovated home, which is clearly more grand than before.
0:17:50|0:18:1|He couldn't wait to show his girlfriend around his new home, urging the coachman on. The horse galloped faster and faster, stumbling along the way, and soon the carriage arrived at the entrance of the new villa.
0:18:9|0:18:13|In the room at this moment, the silent elderly couple heard the voice of [Cheng Yuan].
0:18:16|0:18:25|Looking towards the sound, [Father], who just said not to come back, is more excited than anyone else at the moment. [Mother], with an apron on, immediately gets up to greet the first son who is coming home.
0:18:45|0:18:54|Uncle Cheng turned his head to the side, with a look of resistance on his face, pursed his lips, and looked a bit embarrassed. Tian Ge took a photo of them, then adjusted his hat and paid New Year's respects to the elderly couple.
0:19:24|0:19:29|[Mrs. Cheng] enters the room with [Tian Ge], and [Mrs. Cheng] begins psychological negotiations.
0:20:28|0:20:32|Mrs. Cheng was kind, but Brother Tian kept sizing up Brother Yun's family.
0:20:55|0:20:57|[Cheng Yuan] pulled Mother aside and asked quietly.
0:21:55|0:21:59|[Cheng Yuan] closed the door at this moment to prevent Father from hearing the conversation between the two.
0:22:25|0:22:40|Mrs. Cheng went back to the room, Mr. Cheng felt relieved, knowing that she was going to persuade Father Cheng. With a turn, she tightly embraced Brother Tian.
0:22:40|0:22:53|[Mrs. Cheng] lit a pipe, only to have it extinguished by [Mr. Cheng]. Outside the door, there were sounds of laughter from the young couple, while inside the room, [the elderly Cheng couple] looked worried. Just then, [Tian Ge] walked into the room with a mattress, wearing a smile on his face.
0:23:16|0:23:18|[Tian Ge] helped [Cheng Yuan] lay out the mattress.
0:23:37|0:23:44|Saying that, [Father] helped him onto the bed and urged him. [Big Brother] dragged him sideways, kicked his feet, and lay down carefully.
0:23:48|0:23:58|[Susu's Mother]'s feeling penetrated deep into [Cheng Uncle]'s marrow. He stuck his head out and carefully observed this mattress. This wonderful feeling got him excited, and he chuckled with [Cheng Yuan].
0:24:55|0:25:2|[Cheng Yuan] shifted the gear to a higher position, catching [Cheng Mother] off guard and almost causing her to fall off the bed. Afterwards, [Cheng Mother] took out some snacks to treat [Tian Ge].
0:25:23|0:25:29|When it came to this point, [Father] took a puff of his cigarette, the smoke running out of his nose, and began to interrogate the young couple.
0:25:48|0:25:51|Uncle Cheng immediately showed confusion and puzzlement.
0:25:52|0:25:58|Upon hearing this, [Big Brother] felt a bit embarrassed, then shifted his gaze to [Cheng Yuan], talking about his own family.
0:26:25|0:26:39|The atmosphere instantly dropped to freezing point when these words were spoken, [Sister-in-law] dared not speak, clearly looking towards [Big Brother], [Cheng Yuan]'s face was filled with tension and anticipation, while [Big Brother] could only casually flick the cigarette ash, everyone was waiting for him to speak.
0:26:39|0:26:52|He put out the cigarette and got up from the kang, not forgetting to kick [Cheng Yuan] before leaving. [Cheng Yuan] probably understood Father's intention, raised his head, and tentatively asked again. [Big Brother] impatiently replied, "What's up?"
0:27:4|0:27:21|Shortly after, the door was ruthlessly shut. At that moment, the [Big Sister] Cheng Rong family was also getting ready to leave. [Second Sister's Husband] Ding Tu was a middle-aged bald man, and Cheng Rong was picking up a wig to put on Ding Tu. As he looked in the mirror, his wife's expression was elusive, and Ding Tu scolded her.
0:27:21|0:27:33|Cheng Rong hesitated to speak, just continued combing his hair. Ding Tu glanced at him, Cheng Rong didn't answer, then forced a bitter smile, which made Ding Tu even more impatient.
0:27:40|0:27:53|Later, Cheng Rong and Ding Tu were on their way to Father's house when they were blocked by a lively drum team formed spontaneously by the locals. A group of people dressed in various ancient costumes, waving fans, carrying lanterns, carrying loads, and swinging wooden frames.
0:27:53|0:28:11|The entire street was packed with people, all common folks stopping to watch, after all, this was a rare lively scene of the year. Drums were beating loudly, firecrackers were going off, and the [Father] and [Mother] were singing and dancing, along with a group of actors on stilts. Each stilt walker was holding a fan, and after getting on the stilts, they led the dance on the street.
0:28:11|0:28:28|Not far away, Cheng's [Big Brother] Cheng Zhi was also attracted over, along with his son [Younger Son] Nao Nao. Cheng [Big Brother] happened to be out.
0:28:45|0:29:0|He saw Nao Nao and waved to him. It was really difficult to find each other in the stilt walking team. Facing the giants who were two to three meters tall, Cheng [Big Brother] still had to pass through them to find Nao Nao.
0:29:0|0:29:17|Cheng [Big Brother] could only pass through under the stilts, which were a pile of long wooden sticks. He even danced along with the cheerful music, feeling no danger at all, just like a mischievous old child. After passing through the crowd, he finally reunited with Naonao. The affectionate Cheng [Big Brother] didn't forget to buy gifts for Naonao.
0:29:22|0:29:24|Nana leaned in close to his ear.
0:29:41|0:29:55|Glancing back, behind the line was [Wang Mei], Cheng Zhi's wife, a burly and fierce-looking woman. Uncle Cheng lost interest all of a sudden, carried his grandson on his back, and walked back home through the bridge. Nana sat on Uncle Cheng's shoulders, dancing to the rhythm of the bridge procession.
0:29:55|0:30:9|The grandfather and grandson looked up and saw the makeup on the face of the actor Gaoqiao. They immediately joined the crowd and started swaying together. The child who had just said that his mother wouldn't let him go to his grandfather's house now completely forgot about it.
0:30:9|0:30:14|Uncle Cheng's face, which had always been stern, finally broke into a smile. Not far away, Cheng Yuan and [Mrs. Cheng] were standing.
0:30:15|0:30:31|Uncle Cheng is interacting with the actors. With a round and fair face, his clear and bright eyes reveal curiosity about things. Soon, the grandfather and grandson are surrounded by the Takahashi team. [Mrs. Cheng] watches enthusiastically from the side, hands clasped, sweeping away the unhappiness of her children missing the New Year's appointment.
0:30:31|0:30:36|[Tian Ge] also joined them, casually picking up the camera and starting to operate it, and even picked up a fan to interact with them.
0:30:50|0:31:5|Mrs. Cheng covered her mouth and laughed heartily. Meanwhile, the menacing Wang Mei was planning to intercept Cheng Zhi on his way to visit a family. Following him all the way, he finally called out to Cheng Zhi.
0:31:18|0:31:25|Chengzhi and [Wang Mei] are riding their bicycles back. At this moment, [Naonao] is learning how to ride a bicycle.
0:31:44|0:31:52|[Mrs. Cheng] complained with a sense of grievance, but could only swallow her anger, as [Wang Mei] was approaching them at this moment.
0:32:10|0:32:22|[The Middle-aged Woman] was disheveled in the wind, [Mr. Cheng] had long disappeared, and behind them, [Wang Mei] was staring at them intently, with a contemptuous and angry expression on her face, then she gave [Cheng Zhi] a shove.
0:32:27|0:32:43|After finishing speaking, [Cheng Zhi] could only timidly follow him and continue on the way to find their parents-in-law. [Wang Mei] kept pulling [Cheng Zhi] along while being affectionate, which was truly puzzling. He arrived behind the [elderly couple] and reluctantly spoke up.
0:32:57|0:32:59|Nana mistakenly thought that it was [Wang Mei] who wanted to take her home.
0:33:29|0:33:46|As soon as the words fell, [Father] turned the car back home without looking back. Shortly after, [Big Brother] and his family arrived. In the car, [Sister-in-law] was anxiously thinking about something, and her husband [Big Brother] spoke up. Along the way, they met [Second Brother] and [Second Brother's Friend], and [Big Brother] immediately asked the driver to stop the car.
0:33:49|0:33:52|Father, Mother, Big Brother, and Sister-in-law got off the car and warmly greeted each other.
0:34:51|0:34:58|As the conversation came to an end, [Big Brother] kept holding onto [Second Brother]'s hand and only got on the car after being urged by [Second Brother's Friend], then drove away.
0:35:7|0:35:26|Walking away while waving, after the hustle and bustle of the car, the movie of [Big Brother]'s family and [Younger Son] Cheng Yong has just ended. The staff are urging the last audience members who haven't left to exit. That includes [Younger Son] Cheng Yong and his girlfriend [Younger Son's Girlfriend].
0:35:35|0:35:56|Coming out of the cinema, [Younger Son's Girlfriend] was still half asleep, with her eyes half-closed. Cheng Yong zipped up his jacket while supporting [Xiao Feng]. [Xiao Feng] let out a deep yawn and lazily leaned against Cheng Yong. Cheng Yong grabbed his hat, and the two of them got into the car.
0:35:56|0:36:1|At the gate of the Cheng family, two women were shoveling snow into a pile, which is a natural refrigerator unique to Northeast China.
0:36:4|0:36:14|Mrs. Cheng patted her pants leg as she spoke, and [Wang Mei] wanted to help support her and continue to flatter her.
0:37:34|0:38:1|Mother's words struck Cheng Rong's heart, and his face began to look aggrieved. Once inside the house, Mother led him back to the room to sit down, intending to question him thoroughly. Mrs. Cheng put away the wine, but unexpectedly found Cheng Rong's hands were unusually cold, perhaps a sign of physical weakness.
0:38:27|0:38:33|[Wang Mei] seemed to know Ding Tu's secrets, making Ding Tu flustered. [Wang Mei]'s expression became even more animated.
0:38:42|0:38:53|[Mrs. Cheng] is inviting [Cheng Rong] to experience the massage parlor. She gestures for [Cheng Rong] to come closer, but he smiles and politely declines. Unexpectedly, the conversation from the neighboring kitchen is overheard by him.
0:40:0|0:40:23|Ding Tu gestured to [Cheng Rong] when he wasn't paying attention, signaling him not to speak out of turn. Hearing this, [Wang Mei] felt jealous and lashed out at her husband [Cheng Zhi], snatching the book from his hand.
0:40:30|0:40:33|On the other side, [Uncle Cheng] and [Naonao] are skiing, having a great time.
0:40:50|0:41:2|Grandfather and grandson are walking on the snow, enjoying the freedom and pleasure of nature. Meanwhile, [Cheng Yong] and [Xiao Feng] are dozing off in the car, which happens to be parked in front of the [Cheng family] house, where they coincidentally meet [Uncle Cheng] bringing [Nao Nao] home.
0:42:44|0:43:1|[Younger Son] Cheng Yong ignored advice, so [Mother Cheng] had to lean against the window and peek inside. Unable to persuade [Younger Son], [Mother Cheng] got so frustrated that she stomped her feet helplessly, pounded her own back outside the door, and stretched her muscles, perhaps aggravating an old ailment. As she prepared to leave, she couldn't resist stealing one last glance through the window.
0:43:1|0:43:4|Before long, Nao Nao and [Father] also returned home.
0:44:49|0:44:54|Cheng Yong got up and opened the door slowly. [Father] immediately started scolding him harshly.
0:45:24|0:45:40|Saying that, Cheng Yong picked up his clothes and quilt and walked out, looking defiant, and still reminding Xiao Feng. Seeing Cheng Yong leave the room, [Father] finally walked out with relief. Back in the living room, [Mother] cautiously grabbed his arm.
0:45:45|0:45:53|After entering, Wang Mei sneakily approached the door and then pulled Big Brother [Big Brother] Cheng Yuan behind her to whisper in secret.
0:45:55|0:45:58|[Mother] closed the door carefully and said softly.
0:46:19|0:46:36|[Mother] watched as [Father] sat there in silence, slowly sitting down beside him, perhaps realizing she had touched a nerve. Both of them remained silent for a long time, until [Mother] slowly took out a pack of cigarettes from her sleeve, pulled one out, and timidly handed it to him. Little did she expect that [Father], faced with [Mother]'s gesture of goodwill,
0:46:39|0:46:46|Big Brother hung his head dejectedly, creating a tense atmosphere that made Sister-in-law shudder. She took out matches and a lighter, and said to herself.
0:46:52|0:47:0|Cheng [Big Brother] finally looked up at Cheng [Sister-in-law], with a frown forming a character "川" on his forehead, but Cheng [Sister-in-law] continued to calmly light a cigarette for him.
0:47:0|0:47:9|Cheng [Big Brother] took the cigarette, his eyes lowered as if hiding something, his mouth slightly twitched, looking a bit at a loss. He took a deep drag on the cigarette and slowly uttered a few words.
0:47:17|0:47:20|Ding Tu gently closed the door and asked.
0:47:52|0:47:54|He is really a skilled technician.
0:49:4|0:49:13|Cheng [Sister-in-law] put down the vegetables in her hand and left, Cheng [Big Brother] poured a glass of wine, and Ding Tu continued to speak. Ding Tu gestured as he spoke.
0:49:28|0:49:32|Cheng [Sister-in-law] turned back at the sound, and the three of them listened as if Ding was telling a story.
0:49:44|0:49:52|The scene shifts to Qian Dachuan and their second daughter [Cheng Ping] getting ready to visit the wife's family.
0:50:16|0:50:35|The members of the construction team insisted on giving money to the couple, Mr. and Mrs. Da Chuan. Unable to resist the group, [Cheng Ping] had to get on the car. As soon as he stepped in, everyone tacitly put on their helmets, started the motorcycle, and all disappeared in a cloud of smoke. After a while of noise, they returned to Cheng's house, where Wang Mei was gathering firewood and gossiping with Ding Tu.
0:50:40|0:50:43|Ding Tu continued to help him support the wood.
0:51:8|0:51:28|Wang Mei lifted the sawn wood and Ice Tu made way for him. At the same time, the motorcycle team of Second Daughter [Cheng Ping] and Qian Dachuan also arrived late. They drove on the wide road and then onto the snow-covered hillside. There were probably fifty to sixty motorcycles, and the roaring exhaust sounds echoed throughout the village.
0:51:29|0:51:41|Suddenly, Qian Dachuan's motorcycle came to a stop on the flat ground not far away. After the bike stopped, he extinguished the fire and the landlady [Cheng Ping] also got off the bike. Qian Dachuan turned around, took off his helmet, and spoke.
0:52:22|0:52:34|Cheng Zhi gave a perfunctory smile and continued flipping through the book in his hand. Cheng [Mother] widened her eyes and continued to search through Cheng Zhi's hair. [Mother]'s expression and tone were full of tenderness. She asked.
0:52:43|0:52:47|Cheng Zhi completely ignored the concern of Cheng [Mother]. Cheng [Mother] asked again.
0:53:24|0:53:27|On the other side, the assertive Wang Mei was chatting with Cheng Rong.
0:53:55|0:54:16|Saying that, Wang Mei dropped the cloth in her hand and sat down next to Cheng Rong. She was shocked to find two scars on Cheng Rong's face, and she lifted his hair to take a closer look. Cheng Rong quickly pushed her away. Feeling guilty, Cheng Rong glanced at her, and Wang Mei continued talking to herself.
0:54:20|0:54:25|Just then, [Cheng Yuan] and [Tian Ge] returned, and exchanged greetings with [Wang Mei].
0:54:55|0:55:1|At this moment, at the door of the [Cheng Family], [Qian Dachuan] patted [Cheng Ping]'s head, signaling him not to continue the stalemate.
0:55:10|0:55:25|Suddenly, [Chengping] froze. It turned out that [Cheng Yuan] was slowly walking out with [Cheng Da Niang], and when she saw her second daughter, [Cheng Da Niang] couldn't hold back anymore. She pursed her lips, looking a bit absent-minded and unsteady on her feet. From a few meters away, tears streamed down [Chengping]'s face.
0:55:36|0:55:54|[Mother] tightly hugged her daughter, too excited to speak clearly, only managing to utter three words with a sob. [Father] stood awkwardly to the side, watching the mother and daughter finally reunited. Despite his usual tough demeanor, he dared not say a word. [Mother] cupped [Ping]'s face, but her gaze was fixed on [Chuan].
0:56:14|0:56:28|[Cheng Rong] and others rushed over when they heard the sound.
0:56:33|0:56:44|Mrs. Cheng remained silent, [Cheng Ping] glanced at [Qian Dachuan], and [Uncle Cheng] was probably still sulking. At this moment, [Big Brother] Cheng Zhi stepped forward to break the awkward silence.
0:57:8|0:57:22|[Cheng Ping] walked into the room as he spoke. [Uncle Cheng] didn't even look up when he heard the commotion, and Commotion had never seen Grandpa so indifferent, so he could only weakly say a sentence.
0:57:24|0:57:42|Just then, [Chengping] walked to the door, followed closely by [Big Brother] and [Big Sister]. Seeing no response from [Father], he straightened his clothes, stared at [Uncle Cheng] intently, and tentatively called out.
0:57:42|0:57:48|Saying that, [Father] walked into the house, followed by [Mother] and [Ding Tu], all staring at [Second Sister] with a look of unease.
0:57:51|0:58:1|Uncle Cheng remained silent, everyone waited outside the door for him to speak. The wrinkles on his face became more pronounced, and Sister Cheng Rong couldn't bear to watch as she leaned against the door frame.
0:58:8|0:58:23|At this moment, [Mrs. Cheng] came to find her husband. She walked into the room and glanced back at her children. [Mr. Cheng] was stubborn and cared about his reputation, and [Mrs. Cheng] knew it best. Worried that her daughter's self-esteem would be hurt, [Mother] Mrs. Cheng spoke up for her daughter first.
0:58:40|0:58:52|Cheng Ping's tone was mixed with pleading and helplessness. At this moment, [Mother] Mrs. Cheng also spoke up for him.
0:59:3|0:59:12|In the face of their children's persuasion, [Father] Cheng remained indifferent throughout, not even changing his posture. At this moment, [Younger Son] Cheng Yong woke up and quickly ran to another room to wake up Xiao Feng.
0:59:19|0:59:32|Xiaofeng slowly got up in a daze, poking her head out from under the covers. Then, Ding Tu walked into the room and took out something from his hand, intending to give it to Xiaofeng. He sneaked in while Xiaofeng was combing her hair, taking out two round boxes from his suit pocket.
0:59:36|0:59:49|Xiaofeng shook off and ran out in a hurry, while Bingtu secretly placed two round boxes on the table. Inside the house, the innocent Naonao didn't know what had happened, so he quietly whispered in the ear of [Mother] Mrs. Cheng.
0:59:51|1:0:3|Mrs. Cheng looked up and saw a few tears sliding down Mr. Cheng's face, forming a clear boundary with his dry skin. Mr. Cheng spoke, his tone mixed with shock.
1:0:3|1:0:11|The other family members were all extremely happy. Cheng Yuan was the first to run out to inform Father Qian, who had been standing outside for a long time and was frozen stiff.
1:0:12|1:0:29|Chengyuan hurriedly ran towards [Dachuan]. [Dachuan] threw his hat and quickly led the motorcycle into Cheng's home. He had been waiting for this moment for too long, and the heavy motorcycle now seemed incredibly light. Chengyuan helped [Dachuan] carry things, and as soon as he parked the motorcycle, [Dachuan] walked into Cheng's home.
1:0:41|1:0:52|Uncle Cheng heard the sound and walked out of the room. Although it wasn't a long distance, Uncle Cheng's steps seemed heavier. He stopped for a moment, then walked to the middle of the crowd.
1:0:57|1:1:15|As soon as the words fell, there was a sudden burst of cheerful firecrackers on the roof, which turned out to be lit by [Father] and [Mother]. With [Uncle Cheng]'s knot finally untied, the family took a group photo in front of the chessboard. After the laughter and joy, everyone rushed to the wedding hall and embraced each other.
1:1:15|1:1:21|[Cheng Ping] and [Da Chuan] then took out a coat they had prepared in advance to give to [Cheng's Mother], who felt a little embarrassed as she held the coat.
1:1:41|1:1:45|Everyone praised [Mother Cheng] for looking good, and then [Father Chuan] took out two bottles of wine.
1:1:55|1:2:0|Afterwards, [Father] took out two pieces of top-quality fabric.
1:2:48|1:2:51|Uncle Cheng slammed the table, leaving everyone stunned.
1:3:1|1:3:11|Everyone felt puzzled and dared not disobey his orders, so they could only retreat quietly. [Middle-aged Woman] was still worried, afraid that [Middle-aged Man] would scold the Second Daughter again.
1:3:11|1:3:29|Mrs. Cheng closed the door and stood outside, struggling to tiptoe. Unfortunately, the window was covered with paper, so she couldn't see or hear anything. She had to take off her coat and leave. Inside the house, Mr. Cheng spoke first, and Cheng Ping and Da Chuan sat down on his left and right with their backs to him.
1:3:32|1:3:40|Glancing back from time to time, the expression on [Mother]'s face was solemn and fearful.
1:4:0|1:4:17|Uncle Cheng immediately asked. Qian [Dachuan] confidently replied. Hearing this number outside the door, [Sister-in-law] couldn't help but exclaim in amazement.
1:4:23|1:4:48|Although everyone was sitting in the living room, they all unconsciously paid attention to the conversation in the room. [Father] raised his hand and placed it on the table. Unable to bear it any longer, [Father] suppressed his anger and responded. Chong [Uncle] lowered his head somewhat dejectedly.
1:4:54|1:5:12|This speech left Father Cheng speechless, as he nodded in self-reproach, pursed his lips, and raised a corner of his mouth in a bitter smile. Father Cheng's face was full of doubt.
1:5:20|1:5:32|Cheng [Uncle] turned his back, at a loss for words, and had to bring in reinforcements. At this moment, [Ding Tu] was examining the small objects in the living room, and immediately got up, walking towards the room with a serious and measured pace.
1:5:42|1:5:51|Uncle Cheng was obviously dissatisfied with [Ding Tu]'s answer, his mouth moved slightly, indicating frustration. [Ding Tu] put his hands in his pockets and swaggered out.
1:5:54|1:6:9|In the living room, [Mrs. Cheng] stood up, while Xiaofeng couldn't help but laugh. Seeing no movement in the room, [Mrs. Cheng] shrugged off her coat and walked unsteadily into the room. No one in the living room paid any attention, everyone continued doing their own thing, but she called [Ding Tu] over, and he followed her in.
1:6:9|1:6:15|Inside the house, [Father] sat cross-legged, while [Big Brother] looked curiously at the new son-in-law, a gentle smile on his face.
1:6:32|1:6:42|[Qian Dachuan] didn't hide his feelings, [Cheng Dashu] just smiled without saying anything, picking up the cigarette box next to him and shaking it.
1:6:48|1:7:5|Chen Ping took out a match and gently struck it against the flint. [Uncle Chen] lit a cigarette with it. Then, Chen Ping passed the fire to [Da Chuan], while [Uncle Chen] took a puff of smoke and started checking the household registration. The wrinkled face of [Uncle Chen] broke into a smile.
1:7:17|1:7:39|Da Chuan was relaxed, and a small figure appeared, it turned out to be [Nao Nao]. [Nao Nao] happily took the toy, the scene shifted, Mrs. Cheng was inquiring about the true situation of Ding Tu [Da Chuan].
1:7:52|1:7:59|Ding Tu carried the New Year goods, draped in a British coat. Before he went far, he turned back and called out to Mother Cheng.
1:8:10|1:8:22|With the promise from his mother-in-law, Ding Tu finally felt relieved and walked confidently towards the outside, occasionally looking back at Cheng Da-niang. In the snowy field, [Da Chuan] was diligently chopping the firewood to be burned tonight.
1:8:22|1:8:32|[Da Chuan], tall and strong, split the firewood into two pieces with one swing of the axe, while the women inside the house were eating fruit and admiring the robust figure of [Da Chuan] in front of them.
1:8:33|1:8:46|The women's faces revealed a hint of fascination inadvertently, while [Father], who was focused on chopping firewood, completely did not notice the several women standing by the window. In the kitchen, Mother was preparing the once-a-year reunion dinner for everyone.
1:8:53|1:9:5|Wang Mei offered to help, which was initially comforting, until she noticed something in Madam Cheng's hand - a gold ring. Wang Mei shook the water off her hand, then grabbed Madam Cheng's hand.
1:9:22|1:9:28|Mom, this is great, [Wang Mei] is holding onto Sister-in-law Cheng without letting go, at this moment, Cheng Ping goes outside and calls out to Big Brother [Cheng Zhi].
1:9:32|1:9:45|[Big Brother] hurried off, leaving Da Chuan alone to handle the meat. Their figures grew smaller and smaller, while Da Chuan efficiently packed the meat into baskets. The scene then cut back to the kitchen, where [Wang Mei] was trying hard to contain her excitement.
1:10:20|1:10:49|Chengzhi left dejectedly with his hands behind his back and his head bowed. [Wang Mei] began to talk about the shop in a secretive manner. Chengrong and Chengping were next door and they both understood [Wang Mei]'s intentions. As soon as they heard [Wang Mei]'s voice, Chengping couldn't sit still. Chengrong also joined the conversation.
1:10:55|1:10:59|Xiaofeng and Cheng Yong leave the kitchen.
1:11:23|1:11:48|In the next room, Cheng Yong brought in a radio to stop the conversation between [Wang Mei]. Cheng Yong turned the music up to the maximum, causing both Cheng Yong and Xiao Feng to cover their ears and flee. In the snowy field, [Qian Dachuan] was still diligently chopping wood, while [Ding Tu] walked into the house and exchanged a few words with him.
1:11:48|1:11:51|In the gap of the conversation, [Cheng Ping] walked out of the gate.
1:12:15|1:12:31|[Ding Tu] looked disdainful, showing no intention of backing down. After [Ding Tu] finished speaking and turned to leave, [Qian Da Chuan] grabbed his British-style trench coat.
1:12:36|1:12:53|[Qian Dachuan] exerted a little force, and [Ding Tu]'s skinny figure was pushed a meter away. His defiant expression was seen by [Cheng Ping] not far away. [Cheng Ping] carefully walked towards the snowy slope, with [Ding Tu] still showing concern. Ignoring him, [Cheng Ping] just glanced back and walked straight towards [Dachuan].
1:13:13|1:13:26|[Da Chuan] walked home with [Cheng Ping], while [Wang Mei] was lying on the kang cracking melon seeds, as if thinking about something. She casually spat out the melon seed shells on the ground. At that moment, [Cheng Ping] approached [Wang Mei].
1:13:32|1:13:36|[Wang Mei] helps [Cheng Ping] take off his shoes while smoothing out the bedding for him.
1:14:42|1:14:54|Welcome, [Wang Mei] gestured for [Cheng Ping] to lie down, slowly bending over with her ear gently pressed against [Cheng Ping]'s belly. Meanwhile in the kitchen, [Da Chuan] quietly approached [Cheng Da Niang].
1:15:31|1:15:36|[Wang Mei] just said "sorry" a second ago, and the next second she opened the box, exclaiming in amazement.
1:15:58|1:16:15|[Qian Dachuan] had a big smile on his face, took off his clothes and put them on the chair. [Wang Mei] watched him walk out of the room, touched the gold ring that couldn't be taken off with her hand, then leaned over and whispered to [Cheng Ping], giggling uncontrollably and even jokingly patted [Cheng Ping] on the back.
1:16:15|1:16:24|In the kitchen, [Father] appeared to be the image of a househusband, bustling around in an apron, tending to the fire and chopping vegetables. [Mother] stood behind him and asked.
1:16:28|1:16:44|Mrs. Cheng cracked eggs while chatting with Mr. Qian. After a pause, Mrs. Cheng added.
1:17:23|1:17:41|The [Big Brother] in front didn't forget to chat while cutting vegetables. He looked up with gratitude and sincerity. In the living room, everyone was lively, not just a festive atmosphere. Nana and Xiaofeng hung lanterns together, and after the adults set up the round table, a move by [Wang Mei] caught everyone's attention.
1:18:24|1:18:27|In the kitchen, [Big Brother] is stirring the pot over a high flame.
1:18:44|1:19:6|Mom, let's have a peaceful and harmonious year this year, and do it well. Outside the house, the grandfather and grandson are setting off firecrackers. Father [Father] always has a friendly smile for the children. Before long, everyone is sitting around, welcoming the arrival of the new year. Soon, Big Brother [Big Brother] brings his specialty dish to the table.
1:19:10|1:19:28|Xiao Feng led the applause, brought Da Chun to sit down, and finally everyone was present. Cheng [Father] leisurely lit a cigarette. When Nao Nao was about to pick up some dishes, [Wang Mei] moved her hand away and quietly reminded her. Nao Nao agilely jumped off the table to pay New Year's greetings.
1:20:20|1:20:34|[Cheng Yong] took out a set of landlord's robes for him to wear, along with a cute little hat. Nao Nao kowtowed to everyone for half a year.
1:20:52|1:20:59|Naonao stood on the kang with a proud look, causing everyone to burst into laughter. At this moment, [Cheng Yong] raised his glass.
1:21:10|1:21:15|He paused, pretending to be relaxed.
1:22:8|1:22:14|[Ugly Mother-in-law] had a flush on her face, raised her glass and drank it all, then covered her mouth and chuckled. The glasses of the elderly couple had just emptied.
1:22:42|1:22:56|He poured wine for the elderly couple, amidst a mix of worries and lights. [Father] held up his wine glass, his hand slightly shaking, while [Mother] smiled kindly. [Father] took the lead in the conversation, opening up his heart.
1:23:12|1:23:20|[Mrs. Cheng] watched anxiously from the side as the adults drank and made a commotion. She took a sip secretly and then [Cheng Yong] spoke up.
1:23:44|1:23:48|At this moment, [Cheng Yong] gestured for Xiao Feng to go to the room and get something.
1:24:7|1:24:11|[Cheng Yong] joked around with everyone while holding a box with a national flag and the words "donation" on it.
1:24:18|1:24:26|Unfortunately, no one responded, leaving [Cheng Yong] feeling embarrassed. As he spoke, [Cheng Yong] pointed to the comical donation box.
1:24:33|1:24:54|It's [Wang Mei]'s turn. Da Chuan shyly hands over the wine glass, while [Wang Mei] flatteringly toasts him. The three of them finish their drinks in one gulp, and [Wang Mei] wipes her mouth directly with her hand. Just as Da Chuan is about to say something, [Wang Mei] interrupts him.
1:25:0|1:25:7|Cheng Zhi was drinking alone, and Cheng Yuan also stood up.
1:25:21|1:25:30|As soon as these words were spoken, the crowd began to discuss it. [Uncle Cheng] seemed to perk up, slowly exhaling smoke, and asked disdainfully.
1:25:50|1:25:59|At this moment, [Big Brother] stepped forward. Cheng Yuan defended himself indignantly.
1:26:45|1:26:48|The two brothers started to argue, with neither willing to give in to the other.
1:27:7|1:27:14|[Big Brother]'s originally kind face darkened, Ding Tong spoke. Cheng Yuan looked unconvinced.
1:27:31|1:27:39|Father's words had just fallen, and Big Brother's eyes, lowered, revealed a hint of sharpness. His face, originally tanned dark, couldn't hold back a smile, only pursing his lips.
1:27:41|1:27:50|Cheng Ping echoed in agreement, the wrinkles on Father's face becoming more pronounced. Everyone remained silent, and Big Brother, sensing the situation was not right, stood up first.
1:28:14|1:28:23|Father was seen holding an empty plate, rummaging through a drawer in the room. On the other side, everyone watched as Younger Son, drunk, fell asleep in a daze.
1:28:23|1:28:32|Before long, [Uncle Cheng] came out carrying a plate with money scattered on it, placing it right in the center of the table. Everyone stared in astonishment at the money.
1:28:40|1:28:50|Uncle Cheng sat down heavily, not answering his question. Everyone looked at each other, no one dared to speak. Only Sister-in-law Wang stared at the money on the plate, licking her lips and blinking.
1:28:57|1:29:12|Speak up, [Father] poured himself a full glass of wine. At this moment, there was a noise outside the door, [Mother] pointed to the window, indicating for [Big Brother] to open the door. In the dark night, only an old woman holding a basket could be seen standing outside the door.
1:29:25|1:29:48|[Ding Tu] walked out in confusion. Upon hearing the noise, [Cheng Rong] abandoned his pity and walked to the door, his face showing pain and unease. As he reached the doorway, he caught a glimpse of [Cheng Rong] eavesdropping on the side, while the old woman remained kneeling. Seeing this, Cheng Rong quickly helped her up.
1:30:21|1:30:40|Cheng Rong looked at the New Year goods in the hands of [Middle-aged Woman], realizing that they were prepared by his own family. His chest felt as if it was being pressed by an invisible boulder, his mouth trembling uncontrollably, wanting to hold back tears and run into the house. Cheng Rong forcefully closed the door, and [Middle-aged Woman] let out a heavy sigh.
1:30:40|1:30:45|Upon returning to the room, [Cheng Rongyi] collapsed on the sofa and burst into tears.
1:31:7|1:31:9|And at this moment, [Mother] stood outside the door, at a loss.
1:31:14|1:31:23|Cheng Yong couldn't swallow this anger and started fighting with [Ding Tu]. [Ding Tu], who used to dress in suits and leather shoes, was directly pressed to the ground and rubbed in the snow. The two rolled around in the snow, while [Xiao Feng] watched from the side.
1:31:31|1:31:39|The onlooker [Xiao Feng], who doesn't mind getting involved in big matters, originally wanted to help Cheng Yong. Unexpectedly, as he leaped forward, he lost his balance and all three of them fell into the snow together.
1:31:39|1:31:51|[Ding Tu] took the opportunity to press Cheng Yong and [Xiao Feng] to the ground, [Xiao Feng] cried loudly, the three of them stacked up like Arhats, with Cheng Yong at the bottom being pressed and unable to get up, so he had to use the snow at hand to hit [Ding Tu]'s eyes.
1:31:54|1:32:3|Hearing the commotion outside the door, [Father] and the others all rushed out. Qian Dachuan first separated [Ding Tu] and the two, then [Cheng Ping] quickly pulled up Xiaofeng.
1:32:40|1:32:43|[Ding Tu] looked down at the wig that had been pulled off the ground.
1:32:56|1:33:16|When Teng Yong and [Ding Tu] were about to fight, [Uncle Cheng] walked out from the house. The sound of him closing the door made everyone freeze in place. The angry voices and persuasions all stopped abruptly, as if the world had been frozen. He slowly walked down the snowy slope, hands behind his back, and bent down to pick up [Ding Tu]'s wig.
1:33:16|1:33:20|His suit jacket also shook as he walked up to [Ding Tu], then said.
1:33:26|1:33:52|[Ding Tu] took the wig and coat with a look of regret, then left without looking back, leaving [Uncle Cheng] standing there puzzled. Inside the house, [Cheng Ping] was already in tears. He sobbed a few times, looking at [Aunt Cheng]. He pursed his lips.
1:34:12|1:34:23|[Cheng Ping] raised his absent-minded eyes and looked at [Mrs. Cheng], she didn't say anything, just held her daughter. At this moment, the eldest son [Cheng Zhi] walked out unsteadily, holding a glass of white wine.
1:34:33|1:34:50|[Cheng Rong] leaned on [Mother Cheng]'s shoulder, crying. [Mother Cheng]'s eyes gradually became dull and cloudy. [Cheng Zhi] finished the white wine in his hand, was about to say something to [Cheng Rong], but hesitated, and went back alone.
1:35:18|1:35:25|At this moment, [Cheng Zhi] sat at the table, looking at the dishes on the table, wiped his nose, feeling really uncomfortable in his heart.
1:35:33|1:35:37|Shortly after, [Cheng Rong] walked straight out of the house.
1:35:50|1:36:4|[Cheng Rong] pushed away the hands of [Cheng Yuan] and [Tian Ge], walking out of the house on his own, while everyone tried to stop him. Walking down the snowy slope, [Wang Mei] tried to support him, but was pushed away. [Cheng Yong] and [Cheng Ping] stood on either side, about to reach out and grab his hand, but were also pushed away.
1:36:4|1:36:16|[Cheng Yuan] and [Tian Ge] were worried about him walking alone, so they ran forward to send him back. The scene shifted, [Cheng Zhi] was still holding onto the bottle of alcohol, [Wang Mei] felt uneasy and snatched the bottle from his hand.
1:36:22|1:36:46|[Wang Mei] began to search the house for the dish that was just made. Cheng Zhi grabbed [Wang Mei]'s collar. The elderly couple from the Chu family rushed over to pull Cheng Zhi away. Cheng Zhi struggled with all his might, but [Wang Mei] looked pleased, calmly adjusting her collar.
1:36:49|1:37:6|Cheng Zhi, who had always been obedient, unexpectedly started a fight this time and gave him a loud slap. Just as one wave subsided, another wave rose, how could Wang Mei bear this anger, she picked up the dishes and smashed them on the ground, looking ferocious as she moved forward, wanting to grab Cheng Zhi's hair.
1:37:6|1:37:12|Cheng Yong stood in front, holding his hands, but unexpectedly Cheng Zhi wanted to scratch [Wang Mei]'s face, pushing Cheng Yong aside.
1:37:17|1:37:26|It was clear that the adults' chaotic voices were of no use, disturbing Nao Nao who was sleeping next to them. He simply rubbed his eyes and went back to sleep.
1:37:44|1:37:51|[Wang Mei] was thoroughly enraged and started smashing things again. After smashing for a while, she sat down to catch her breath, and Cheng Yong continued to provoke her.
1:38:2|1:38:16|Wang Mei, like a clown being toyed with, really picked up a plate and, amidst screams, completely smashed the mirror that only had a crack in it, along with the table of reunion dinner, causing the exquisitely framed family portrait on the wall behind her to tilt and fall.
1:38:16|1:38:21|After the curtain falls, this farce comes to an end, and the families disperse amidst grumbling and complaints.
1:38:22|1:38:34|Only [Middle-aged Woman] was left standing in the midst of this mess, with the ground completely impassable, making it difficult to find a place to stand. At this moment, [Chengping] and [Qian Dachuan] brought brooms to clean up, but [Middle-aged Woman] said.
1:38:46|1:39:6|Upon hearing this, [Father] and [Mother] exchanged a glance, remaining silent. [Sister-in-law] swallowed slowly, looking at the leftovers on the ground, with the lantern on the wall still shining. The next morning, a figure appeared at the entrance of [Father's] house. He kept walking towards the door, the figure getting smaller and eventually disappearing.
1:39:6|1:39:12|Early in the morning, the [Father and Mother] decided to leave home. Before they left, [Big Sister-in-law] tearfully said goodbye to [Big Brother].
1:39:17|1:39:26|[Mrs. Cheng] was still wearing the coat that [Mr. Cheng] had given her. The elderly couple both looked back at the small western-style building from the carriage. Then, [Mr. Cheng] instructed the coachman without looking back.
1:39:29|1:39:45|[Mrs. Cheng] still leaned on the railing and looked into the distance, her gaze lingering, unable to move away from the home where she had lived her whole life. Mr. Cheng, on the other hand, didn't even glance back, the silhouette of the carriage gradually disappearing into the snowy landscape, obscured by layers of trees, making it even harder to see the trace of the elderly couple.
1:39:45|1:39:50|The [Father and Mother] of the family swayed on the carriage, while the small western-style building was slowly covered by snow and ice.
1:39:51|1:40:9|The originally magnificent walls were wrapped in silver decorations, blending with the surroundings. In fact, what [Father and Mother] looked forward to the most was this New Year's Day. Especially after the big commotion last year, this year's anticipation brought even more joy to them. Regardless of everyone's individual motives, today the whole family finally gathered together.
1:40:10|1:40:29|This is the happiest day for [Mother], but in the end, only [Naonao] in the family had a good New Year. This absurd farce ended with [Mr. and Mrs. Cheng] bravely pursuing their own happiness in old age. Although the plot is somewhat exaggerated, it realistically makes people dare not face it.
1:40:29|1:40:32|At the end of the story, there is a conversation between the [Old Couple].
