0:4:0|0:4:6|[Zhong Xiaonian], who had already prepared for all possibilities, stared closely at [Liu Wenshi], while [Liu Wenshi] pretended to be calm and said,
0:4:47|0:4:56|In the enclosed sauna room filled with steam, the sweating [Liu Wenshi] suppressed the heat and said to [Zhong Xiaonian],
0:5:0|0:5:14|[Zhong Xiaonian] watched as [Liu Wenshi] stood up helplessly, then walked to the fire pit in the sauna room. Bending down, [Zhong Xiaonian] picked up a ladle and extinguished the burning charcoal, causing wisps of white smoke to rise above the extinguished charcoal.
0:5:15|0:5:26|Turning around and walking to their positions, they picked up a towel to wipe their faces. At that moment, the screen showed the three of them standing up one after another, shaking hands and saying
0:5:33|0:5:50|The scene then shifts to the central screen, where a room covered in iron mesh is filled with multiple monitors and photos. A man sits in front of the screen, observing everything. On the wall outside the room, the title "The Players Behind the Scenes" is displayed in LED lights, shining brightly.
0:5:51|0:5:56|At night, a door suddenly opened from inside and [Zeng Guangwen] walked out.
0:5:57|0:6:26|He walked with heavy steps on the spacious rooftop, then took out his phone from his pocket and dialed a number with a heavy heart. [Zhong Xiaonian] responded expressionlessly, then put down the phone and shifted his gaze from the distance to the phone, unhesitatingly closing it.
0:6:26|0:6:39|Standing on the edge of the corner of the rooftop, looking at the towering skyscrapers, [Zhong Xiaonian] deeply understood that their actions had violated the legal taboos. At this moment, the attitude of the disciple also confirmed his suspicions.
0:6:39|0:6:49|Reluctant to face the legal consequences and wanting to escape it all, Zeng Guangwen chose a path of no return. Looking at the dizzying abyss beneath his feet, he took that desperate step.
0:6:50|0:7:1|In the dim moonlight, the atmosphere on the rooftop became particularly eerie. [Zhong Xiaonian], who was sound asleep in the early morning, was suddenly awakened, with a vacant look in his eyes, clearly still not fully recovered from the nightmare.
0:7:1|0:7:17|He sat up with difficulty, supporting his head with his hand. His wife [Wei Simeng] slowly opened her eyes by the pillow, listening to the movements of [Zhong Xiaonian] without saying a word. [Zhong Xiaonian] got up and walked towards the bathroom, while [Wei Simeng] just glanced at him with her peripheral vision. After washing his face, [Zhong Xiaonian] picked up a towel to dry off the water droplets.
0:7:17|0:7:24|Yu Guang saw [Wei Simeng] in the mirror, and [Wei Simeng] said in confusion
0:7:32|0:7:45|[Zhong Xiaonian] disdainfully threw the towel on the sink, brushed past [Wei Simeng], leaving [Wei Simeng] standing there, hugging her thin arms. Early in the morning, [Zhong Xiaonian] arrived at the wonton shop. The boss said,
0:7:58|0:8:13|[Zhong Xiaonian] took the lunch box from the boss and walked out of the wonton shop. What came into view was a tree-lined path leading deep into the forest, with tall pine and cypress trees on both sides. The grass on the lawn was still lush, and the path was littered with fallen yellow leaves.
0:8:13|0:8:33|[Zhong Xiaonian] drove a luxurious car on the narrow road, attracting attention. His fingers lightly touched the password lock set up on the side of the road, adding a touch of solemnity to the villa with the integration of smart technology. The luxury car continued to drive on the winding road, shrouded in the autumn atmosphere, creating a hazy scene around.
0:8:33|0:8:46|The wealthy Zhong Xiaonian is approachable, even greeting workers familiarly while sitting in his luxury car. The car then stops in front of a modern-style villa, located next to a small lake, with a unique and distinctive design.
0:8:46|0:9:4|[Zhong Xiaonian] got off the car and casually closed the door, scanning everything around with a relaxed look, and strolled into the villa. The decoration inside the villa was simple yet elegant, [Zhong Xiaonian] and [Wei Simeng] absentmindedly had breakfast while listening to the latest financial news on the screen.
0:9:56|0:10:12|Watching Liu Wenshi on the screen, [Zhong Xiaonian] responded contemptuously, while [Wei Simeng] turned off the screen and asked penetratingly, [Zhong Xiaonian] did not directly answer [Wei Simeng]'s question, but instead used the example of a long-term wonton shop to explain.
0:10:27|0:10:43|[Zhong Xiaonian] didn't want to explain too much, looking helplessly at [Wei Simeng], who angrily picked up the thermos and stood up to walk towards the sink. [Zhong Xiaonian] puzzledly threw the bread with sauce already spread on it onto the plate, stood up and watched [Wei Simeng]'s back, saying,
0:11:10|0:11:16|After [Zhong Xiaonian] finished slurping up a spoonful of wonton, [Wei Simeng] turned off the tap and calmly said,
0:11:21|0:11:29|[Zhong Xiaonian] was feeling a mix of emotions, his eyes fixed on [Wei Simeng]'s figure. On the other side, inside the luxurious auction room,
0:11:30|0:11:37|[Tang Wanwan] proudly raised his hand to signal, while [Zhong Xiaonian] looked at him helplessly.
0:12:45|0:12:53|At this moment, [Tang Wanwan] pushed the door open, breaking the ambiguous atmosphere between the two, making it extremely awkward. He looked at [Zhuang Yi], who was pretending to be nonchalant, and sarcastically said,
0:13:21|0:13:44|The three of them looked at the map in the mirror thoughtfully. [Zhong Xiaonian] expressionlessly returned the lipstick to [Zhuang Yi], who responded with a cold smile as if awakening from a dream. The focus of the three was on [Zhuang Yi], who then threw down the lipstick and arrogantly turned to leave. At this moment, [Tang Wanwan] spoke,
0:14:1|0:14:7|[Zhong Xiaonian], who was wiping his hands, suddenly turned around and grabbed [Tang Wanwan] by the neck.
0:14:14|0:14:27|[Zhu Nan] puzzledly closed the door, while [Zhong Xiaonian] calmly lowered his hand. In a flash, [Zhong Xiaonian] appeared at the venue, walking down the stairs and observing the people chatting over drinks. A waiter handed him a glass of champagne, quickly immersing him in the atmosphere.
0:14:27|0:14:42|In the distance, [Zhu Nan] also noticed [Zhong Xiaonian], while [Tang Wanwan] moved through the crowd with a raised glass. [Wei Simeng] glanced at [Zhong Xiaonian] from the corner of her eye, but he did not approach her. Instead, he raised his glass in a simple gesture from afar, indicating a toast before taking a sip.
0:14:42|0:14:58|The scene shifts from the party to the bustling streets of the city center, with [Zhu Nan] driving and occasionally glancing back at [Zhong Xiaonian] sitting in the back seat. [Zhong Xiaonian] rests his head on his hand against the car window, looking at the colorful lights outside, furrowing his brow, lost in deep thought.
0:14:58|0:15:12|Before long, a luxury car arrived at the entrance of the villa, with [Zhu Nan] supporting [Zhong Xiaonian]. At that moment, [Zhong Xiaonian] said,
0:15:27|0:15:44|With a vacant look in his eyes, [Zhu Nan] listened to his orders, suppressing his inner discontent, while [Zhong Xiaonian] dragged his heavy feet up the stairs. At this moment, the lights on either side of the door dimmed, and as he opened the door and staggered into the room, facing the spacious living room, he shouted loudly,
0:16:4|0:16:15|Facing the empty bedroom, [Zhong Xiaonian] fell silent. Feeling troubled, he lowered his head and dejectedly took off his suit jacket, draping it over his arm. With a heavy heart, he turned around and walked out of the bedroom.
0:16:34|0:16:48|The wall, adorned with glasses and earrings, opens from the middle, revealing a metal safe. [Zhong Xiaonian] enters the safe code while the safe also scans his iris. With a mechanical sound, the safe is opened, revealing important documents inside.
0:16:48|0:17:3|[Zhong Xiaonian] picked up the mobile U disk on top and the computer below, then inserted the hard drive into the computer. The computer screen displayed four particularly prominent words of Union Bank. After entering the password, the computer screen unexpectedly showed a huge number of 2 billion.
0:17:4|0:17:16|[Zhong Xiaonian] turned his eyes, verifying the numbers in his mind, blending with the luxurious dressing room. He then closed the laptop and put it in the safe, closed the safe, and the wall returned to its original state.
0:17:16|0:17:28|He walked out of the dressing room, unbuttoning his clothes as he walked, sat on the edge of the bed, picked up a glass and gulped it down, then placed the glass heavily on the bedside table. He buried his head in the soft bed, the alcohol numbing his brain, making him dizzy.
0:17:28|0:17:47|In his consciousness, the subconscious made him reach into his pocket, and his right hand took out a ring from his pants pocket. He held the ring in both hands, trying hard to see it clearly. The ring sparkled in the light, but due to the numbness from alcohol, his eyesight became blurry. With the last bit of strength, he turned sideways and fell into a deep sleep.
0:17:47|0:18:3|Accompanied by Zhong Xiaonian's deep sleep, the entire villa also entered its resting time with him, lights went out one by one, curtains slowly closed, enveloping the bedroom, and the calm lake surface reflected the villa.
0:18:3|0:18:20|The night enveloped everything in its embrace, as if the whole earth had fallen asleep. Only this man, intoxicated and deeply asleep, was filled with loneliness, longing to be comforted and understood. The person who could have been in his arms has now also drifted away.
0:18:20|0:18:39|At 9:15 in the morning, the alarm clock woke up the sleeping [Zhong Xiaonian] as usual. He turned over and turned off the alarm. The moment his hand touched the alarm clock, the lights in the entire villa also woke up. Exhausted, [Zhong Xiaonian] turned over again, slowly opened his eyes, wanting to see if [Wei Simeng] had returned.
0:18:39|0:18:48|He touched the blanket, feeling no warmth left, and with a hoarse voice, called out again. [Zhong Xiaonian] looked around in astonishment, searching for [Wei Simeng]'s figure.
0:19:41|0:20:0|Seeing no response outside the door, he lowered his head and picked up his phone to dial [Wei Simeng]'s number. Suddenly realizing there was no signal on his phone, he anxiously raised his phone and searched for a signal in every corner of the room. Back in the bedroom, he put down his phone in frustration. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that something was wrong. What on earth was going on?
0:20:0|0:20:8|When he couldn't figure it out and wanted to open the curtains to let in some fresh air, but at the moment he pressed the button, the curtains didn't open as quickly as usual.
0:20:10|0:20:17|[Zhong Xiaonian] sensed a hint of danger, and the scene in front of him made his pupils dilate, prompting him to move forward involuntarily.
0:20:18|0:20:34|The curtain pulled back is not made of transparent glass, but a wall formed by overlapping short wooden strips, with no breathing space in the messy wall. The luxurious room contrasts sharply with this wall, and at this moment, Zhong Xiaonian finally realizes the seriousness of the situation.
0:20:34|0:20:44|The rapid pounding sound reflects the fear of [Zhong Xiaonian], who repeatedly punches and kicks the door. At this moment, the wall-mounted Tianzi grid display screen emits the sound of financial news.
0:21:14|0:21:26|Upon hearing it, [Zhong Xiaonian] looked in astonishment at the phone in his hand that had no signal, without hesitation he walked into the locker room, took out a golf club, and fiercely approached the door, viciously smashing the doorknob.
0:21:27|0:21:46|The doorknob fell to the ground with each knock, but the door remained motionless. So [Zhong Xiaonian] used his body to forcefully hit the door, but it still didn't open. Looking at the hole where the doorknob was installed, he squatted down to try to see what was outside through the hole, only to find an endless darkness.
0:21:46|0:22:3|The monitor playing financial news made a sizzling sound, followed by different icons appearing on each screen, including a microphone, address book, letter, and data. Below the icons were indications of whether to play or not. [Zhong Xiaonian] picked up the remote control and pressed the play button, and the screen showed his conversations with different people.
0:22:52|0:23:11|The screens of the four monitors all revealed the various crimes of [Zhong Xiaonian]. He stared at the screens intently, as if everyone's words were about to engulf him. Just as he was about to fly into a rage and smash the screens, the picture switched to his current situation in the room.
0:23:11|0:23:26|He, under surveillance, searched for the camera along the screen and finally his gaze fell on the face of the broken-arm statue of the Greek goddess. The left eye of the goddess was shining blue, and as he was staring intently at the left eye of the goddess, another sound came from the room.
0:23:26|0:23:49|So [Zhong Xiaonian] followed the sound and found it coming from under the leather sofa. He lay on the ground and used a golf club to hook it out from under the sofa. A pager's packaging box appeared in front of him. [Zhong Xiaonian] opened the box, inside were a walkie-talkie and a charger placed side by side. He first picked up the charger with a puzzled look, then directly held the walkie-talkie to his mouth.
0:23:49|0:23:54|Said by [Zhong Xiaonian] next to the button,
0:24:35|0:24:52|As soon as the mysterious person finished speaking, two multiple-choice questions appeared on the screen in the living room. Option a was to announce a divorce with his wife, and option b was to expose a massive tax evasion. [Zhong Xiaonian] angrily pressed the intercom to inquire, but receiving no response, he directly spoke to the camera,
0:24:58|0:25:11|The radio signal was interrupted, [Zhong Xiaonian] angrily twisted the buttons on the radio, and then threw it towards the seat in anger. The seat bounced the radio to the ground. Fuming with anger, he sat down on the seat and lowered his head in confusion.
0:25:12|0:25:26|Suddenly he thought of the wooden wall in the bedroom, perhaps he could find a surprise from it. He stacked the golf club in the gap of the wooden boards, trying his best to pull the boards down, but the boards remained motionless as if they were grown on the wall.
0:25:27|0:25:43|He then noticed the treadmill beside him and decided to use its power to pull down the wooden board. He found a strong belt, fixed it on the treadmill track, plugged in the power, started the treadmill, wrapped the strong belt around the track, and tied the other end of the strong belt to the wooden board. With everything ready,
0:25:43|0:25:47|Start the treadmill, [Zhong Xiaonian]'s strong belt becomes taut as the treadmill operates.
0:25:48|0:26:5|When [Zhong Xiaonian] increased the speed, the treadmill was pulled backwards. Seeing this, he quickly stepped on the treadmill to increase the gravity, but it was still of no use. The strong force pulled the treadmill and [Zhong Xiaonian] backwards at the same time. [Zhong Xiaonian] immediately adjusted his standing posture to enhance the friction between the treadmill and the ground.
0:26:6|0:26:19|The treadmill suddenly stopped, [Zhong Xiaonian] turned back to check the power belt and the treadmill, then increased the speed of the treadmill again. [Zhong Xiaonian] tightly gripped the treadmill with both hands, glancing back. At this moment, the power belt suddenly retracted.
0:26:19|0:26:36|The torn wooden strip caught at the end of the treadmill flew towards [Zhong Xiaonian]. He turned around in horror, but the broken strip still cut his forehead, the pain making [Zhong Xiaonian] couldn't help but reach out to touch the wound. In the afternoon, [Zhu Nan] brought toiletries to [Wei Simeng].
0:26:53|0:27:2|[Zhu Nan] looked earnestly at [Wei Simeng], hoping to get a satisfactory answer. However, [Wei Simeng] nonchalantly lowered his head, and at that moment, a phone call interrupted the awkward atmosphere between the two.
0:27:3|0:27:8|[Wei Simeng] sat on the chair next to her as if a great weight had been lifted off her shoulders. At that moment, [Zhu Nan] standing at the door, said,
0:27:10|0:27:25|Shortly after, [Zhu Nan], feeling agitated, closed the door. Inside the secret room, with broken wooden pieces scattered on the floor, [Zhong Xiaonian] broke a hole in the wall with the wooden pieces. At that moment, [Zhong Xiaonian], sitting on the bed adjusting the time on his watch, seemed to hear a sound from the display screen. With a sense of doubt, he walked out of the bedroom.
0:27:26|0:27:32|Just as he walked through the corridor into the living room, the screen was broadcasting the latest financial news of the day.
0:28:0|0:28:8|[Zhong Xiaonian] found the news report absurd, which only confirmed his suspicions. He picked up the fallen walkie-talkie and said,
0:28:37|0:28:43|[Zhong Xiaonian] stood up angrily, but the other party paid no attention and turned off all the lights in the room.
0:28:45|0:29:3|The dark fear did not deter [Zhong Xiaonian], he reached out his hands to feel for the light switch installed on the wall, but pressing it repeatedly had no effect. Suddenly, a red light lit up above his head, [Zhong Xiaonian] looked up in surprise. Then a hole appeared in the corner of the ceiling, hot air rushed into the room.
0:29:3|0:29:7|[Zhong Xiaonian] frowned and waved away the hot air coming towards him.
0:29:8|0:29:15|On the other side, due to the exposure of financial news, a large number of reporters were waiting at Zhuang Yi's company gate. With the protection of bodyguards, Zhuang Yi appeared.
0:29:47|0:29:56|[Zhu Nan] showed the retinal photos stored in his phone to the vendor, and he was satisfied with the vendor's response. He then called [Tang Wanwan] to report.
0:29:58|0:30:23|Tang Wanwan in the parking lot believed in what her assistant Zhu Nan said without any doubt. After hanging up the phone, she walked straight to her car. Meanwhile, Wei Simeng sitting by the hotel window also received a call from a mysterious person. Wei Simeng remained silent as the voice on the other end used a voice changer. Instead of feeling scared, Wei Simeng slowly lifted his head and listened carefully to what the person was saying.
0:30:23|0:30:34|The temperature inside the secret room then reached 65 degrees Celsius, causing [Zhong Xiaonian] to sweat profusely from extreme dehydration. Despite twisting every knob of the bathtub's water release mechanism, no water was released.
0:30:35|0:30:48|He then looked at the glass placed on the bedside table, lifted it above his head, tilted it back, and the remaining water at the bottom of the glass flowed into his mouth. Then he sat on the edge of the bed, taking off his completely soaked clothes.
0:30:48|0:31:6|After he took off all his clothes, the lights suddenly went out. [Zhong Xiaonian] raised his head in confusion, and suddenly the light above the bedroom turned on. In the center of the light, a hole appeared, accompanied by a rush of cold air. He reached out his hand to test the temperature, but the cold air coming towards him made him shiver.
0:31:6|0:31:21|A continuous stream of cold air entered the room, lowering the temperature to 3 degrees Celsius. [Zhong Xiaonian] moved from the bedroom to the living room, away from the source of the cold air. He helplessly wrapped himself in a blanket, curled up on the living room sofa, his blood congealing on his forehead in the low temperature.
0:31:42|0:31:48|Hearing the news about Wei Simeng, the emotionally exhausted Zhong Xiaonian was once again deeply affected.
0:31:48|0:32:2|He stood up slowly and walked towards the screen, where [Wei Simeng] was being carried down from the ambulance by medical staff. He stared at the screen intently, confirming repeatedly. He suppressed the grief in his heart, turned around, picked up the walkie-talkie and asked,
0:32:11|0:32:33|[Zhong Xiaonian], who received no response, was physically and mentally exhausted, instantly losing his support and collapsing to the ground. He angrily pounded the ground with his hands, lying on the ground sobbing uncontrollably, with [Wei Simeng] being his last bottom line. Meanwhile, in the hospital, [Tang Wanwan] walked through the corridor holding flowers, when suddenly a large group of reporters surrounded [Tang Wanwan].
0:32:41|0:32:48|Tang Wanwan, escorted by security guards, calmly walked to Wei Simeng's bedside in the intensive care unit as if nothing had happened.
0:32:48|0:33:8|[Wei Simeng], lying on the hospital bed, suddenly took a deep breath, frowned, and opened his eyes. At 9:30 the next morning, [Zhong Xiaonian], who was sleeping on the floor, was awakened by the sound of the walkie-talkie. He walked to the walkie-talkie, picked it up, and said,
0:33:8|0:33:17|a exposed market manipulation, b exposed [Zhu Nan] as a corporate spy. [Zhong Xiaonian] chose the self-serving option without hesitation.
0:33:18|0:33:31|[Zhong Xiaonian] lowered his head in shame, and the mysterious person immediately closed the screen after getting the answer, restoring peace to the room. At this moment, [Zhong Xiaonian] noticed that the intercom was still receiving signals, sparking a bold idea.
0:33:31|0:33:46|He glanced sideways to check the hidden camera with his peripheral vision, and seeing no movement, he brought the walkie-talkie to his chest and quietly turned the knob. The walkie-talkie's channel was fixed, so [Zhong Xiaonian] turned around and quickly left the living room, swiftly entering the bathroom and closing the door.
0:33:46|0:33:58|Continuing to check the screws on the walkie-talkie, he then opened the mirror, took out the hanging razor, and skillfully disassembled the razor blade inside with quick movements. Then he inserted the sharp corner of the blade.
0:33:58|0:34:9|Twisting hard at the screw mouth, then taking out the tiny screws one by one, prying open the battery, and slowly opening the walkie-talkie. To prevent the circuit board from being damaged, [Zhong Xiaonian] became extra careful.
0:34:9|0:34:29|While carefully examining the circuit board, he noticed a copper wire in the middle of it. He used a blade to remove it, then reassembled the walkie-talkie. Tentatively, he asked if anyone was there, but received no response. Frustrated, Zhong Xiaonian turned the dial, wiped his eyes in disappointment, but had no intention of giving up.
0:34:29|0:34:41|[Zhong Xiaonian] still held onto hope. Just as he was about to press the button, the walkie-talkie crackled with the sound of a car's handbrake being pulled and the door closing. [Zhong Xiaonian] gripped the walkie-talkie tightly, listening carefully.
0:34:43|0:35:0|The vision is blurry here, but it can be confirmed that it is outdoors. The shaking of the camera makes people feel dizzy, and suddenly the picture stops, showing a truck. Once again, as the camera moves, a man appears in the picture, tidying up the instruments in front of the camera, then standing in the center of the frame.
0:35:57|0:36:3|[Tian Yu] felt like she was being played, so she turned and walked away, while [Zhong Xiaonian] angrily threw the walkie-talkie onto the sink.
0:36:4|0:36:15|With his head hanging low, [Zhong Xiaonian] found a hairdryer in a basket nearby, which sparked his inspiration once again. He then went to the dressing room, took off his coat, and straightened the hanger with force.
0:36:15|0:36:32|Walking into the living room, he covered the camera with a blanket, brought out a stool, inserted a straightened clothes hanger into the hair dryer, plugged in the heat source, covered the back air vent of the hair dryer, causing the electric heating element to heat up quickly. When the metal bar turned red, [Zhong Xiaonian] inserted it into the gap in the door.
0:36:32|0:36:45|As the metal bar penetrated the gap, on the other side, [Zhu Nan] stood outside the villa to greet [Tang Wanwan]. With the arrival of the black car, the imposing [Tang Wanwan] got out of the car and took the villa key handed to him by [Zhu Nan].
0:36:45|0:36:52|Tang Wanwan surveyed everything in the villa as they entered. Zhu Nan followed behind silently and closed the door.
0:36:52|0:37:8|Continuing, the two of them walked towards the room on the second floor. Just as Tang Wanwan was about to open the door, Zhong Xiaonian in the secret room had already burned a square on the door. Then he stood up and kicked with all his strength, kicking a big hole in the door, and he crawled out through the hole.
0:37:8|0:37:19|In the pitch-black world outside the door, [Zhong Xiaonian] walked forward with his hand on the wall. Just as he was about to continue walking forward, he unexpectedly stepped into a void. He looked down and then glanced around.
0:37:19|0:37:28|The room was surrounded by endless stone walls, pitch black with only a faint light coming from the doorway.
0:37:28|0:37:44|[Zhong Xiaonian] stood under the steps at the doorway, unable to see the whole picture. The room, enveloped by the stone walls, appeared faint, but its structure was clear at a glance. Above the rectangle, many cylindrical pipes were inserted, and on the left, there was a structure resembling an arch bridge, spanning the middle between the stone walls and the room.
0:37:44|0:37:55|Standing in the room on the second floor, [Tang Wanwan] walked forward with his hands on his waist, looking around. [Zhu Nan] closed the door and observed every move of [Tang Wanwan].
0:37:55|0:38:7|Tang Wanwan then walked straight into the dressing room, took out a sample of Zhong Xiaonian's retina, put it into his eyes and opened the secret compartment. While entering the password, he scanned the retina on the safe.
0:38:7|0:38:17|The crisp sound made [Tang Wanwan] extremely excited. However, after all the safes were opened, the empty safes left him dumbfounded, and he repeatedly checked every layer of the safe.
0:38:17|0:38:29|Disappointed to the core, he suppressed his anger and walked out of the dressing room. Meanwhile, [Zhu Nan] entered the bedroom and looked around. Then he opened the cabinet beside the bed, took out [Zhong Xiaonian]'s passport and ID card.
0:38:29|0:38:38|He flipped through it and held it in his hand, then walked out of the bedroom. Upon entering the hallway, he bumped into [Tang Wanwan] coming out of the dressing room.
0:38:38|0:38:57|So he handed [Zhong Xiaonian]'s passport and ID card to [Tang Wanwan]. [Tang Wanwan] just took a quick look, then the two of them looked at each other. Just as [Tang Wanwan] was standing with hands on hips, lost in thought, the phone in his pocket rang.
0:40:5|0:40:18|Upon learning the truth, [Tang Wanwan] was furious and forced [Zhu Nan] to the side of the sofa, suddenly exerting force, pushing [Zhu Nan] down on the sofa, and using one hand to tightly grip [Zhu Nan]'s neck. Unable to resist, [Zhu Nan] caught a glimpse of the conical ornament placed beside the sofa.
0:40:18|0:40:34|He reached out his hand, stretching as far as he could to grab the ornament, and finally smashed it in the direction of [Tang Wanwan]. [Tang Wanwan] was hit on the forehead and collapsed on the sofa from the strong impact. [Zhu Nan] got up from the sofa, clutching his hand.
0:40:34|0:40:49|The place where [Tang Wanwan] was pinched, he gasped heavily and then staggered away. At this moment, [Tang Wanwan] regained his senses, stood up with his hand covering his injured forehead, and looked around for [Zhu Nan]'s figure. Upon hearing the sound of the door closing, he immediately chased after.
0:40:49|0:41:9|On the other side, [Zhong Xiaonian] overcame his inner fear, took out his phone and turned on the flashlight, observing the surroundings along the walls of the room. Suddenly, he looked up and found the rusty pipes. He extended his phone and carefully examined with the flashlight. Meanwhile, on the highway, [Tang Wanwan] and [Zhu Nan] were driving on the road, racing each other without any obstacles.
0:41:9|0:41:24|As the car entered the curve, [Zhu Nan] used the rearview mirror to observe [Tang Wanwan]'s car, then stepped on the gas pedal. Meanwhile, [Tang Wanwan] intended to overtake by driving towards the outside of the curve, and [Zhu Nan] noticed his intention and immediately adjusted the steering wheel to move in front of him.
0:41:24|0:41:30|[Zhu Nan] repeatedly presses down on [Tang Wanwan]'s car, but [Tang Wanwan] has no intention of giving up and continues to look for opportunities to overtake.
0:41:30|0:41:40|When entering the next turn, [Tang Wanwan] planned to change strategy and overtake from the inside of the curve. However, as he turned the steering wheel, a car driving in the opposite direction appeared in front of him, forcing him to give up the overtaking.
0:41:41|0:41:55|He angrily stepped on the gas pedal and crashed into the back of [Zhu Nan]'s car. Inside the car, [Zhu Nan] was thrown forward by the impact, and the unprepared [Zhu Nan] looked up in the rearview mirror to see [Tang Wanwan] parallel to him. [Zhu Nan] looked at [Tang Wanwan] in horror as he cast a sharp gaze at him.
0:41:56|0:42:7|[Zhu Nan] shifted his gaze back to the front of the car, while [Tang Wanwan] immediately turned the steering wheel after retracting his gaze, squeezing [Zhu Nan]'s car to the edge of the road. Fortunately, there was a wall on the edge to prevent the car from falling off.
0:42:7|0:42:21|Suddenly, as they were turning a corner, a truck appeared driving in the opposite direction. The two of them frantically turned the steering wheel to avoid the truck, while [Zhu Nan] crashed into the roadside wall while trying to dodge the truck, flipping over with the car.
0:42:21|0:42:37|The car rolled over and crushed the fuel tank, causing gasoline to flow onto the ground. Inside the car, [Zhu Nan] had a bloody face and was pinned inside. Unscathed, [Tang Wanwan] smoked a cigarette and played with a lighter as he walked towards [Zhu Nan].
0:42:37|0:42:56|Struggling [Zhu Nan] noticed the gasoline leaking out of the car, with [Tang Wanwan] standing at the end of the gasoline. Terrified, [Zhu Nan] immediately threw [Zhong Xiaonian]'s key at [Tang Wanwan's] feet. Seeing [Tang Wanwan] crouching down to pick up the key, the weak and helpless [Zhu Nan] pleaded,
0:43:28|0:43:37|While in the enclosed environment, [Zhong Xiaonian] noticed the screen showing [Zhu Nan] with blood all over his face as soon as he crawled through the door, just as he was puzzled,
0:43:47|0:43:53|The titles on the screen are "a silence b account password",
0:44:21|0:44:34|[Tang Wanwan] showed a sinister smile upon learning the password, then calmly stood up, turned around, and walked away. Just as everyone let their guard down, [Tang Wanwan] took a deep drag of the cigarette in his hand and threw it behind him.
0:44:35|0:44:53|The cigarette with a spark was thrown into the gasoline at the end, igniting the gasoline instantly. The flame burned along the direction of the gasoline flow, eventually causing an explosion in Zhu Nan's car. The ruthless Tang Wanwan also used a lighter to ignite Zhong Xiaonian's passport and threw it towards the location where Zhu Nan's car exploded.
0:44:53|0:45:5|In the locked room, [Zhong Xiaonian] watched the entire process of [Tang Wanwan] detonating [Zhu Nan]'s car on the screen. As the explosion occurred, the screen went blank, leaving [Zhong Xiaonian] sitting on the sofa in shock.
0:45:6|0:45:20|He still had the whole process of [Tang Wanwan] killing [Zhu Nan] floating in his mind, the scenes in front of him made [Zhong Xiaonian] incredulous. He blamed all these sins on the mysterious person. So he pulled the blanket covering the Greek goddess.
0:45:26|0:45:40|The enraged [Zhong Xiaonian] pushed the armless Greek goddess to the ground. At the moment of contact with the ground, the Greek goddess shattered into countless pieces, but her head remained intact. [Zhong Xiaonian] then picked up the goddess's head and threw it towards the one-way glass next to the living room.
0:45:41|0:45:55|As the camera in the eyes of the Greek goddess shattered, the screen in the center of the control room started showing static. A man sitting in the center of the control room was enjoying all of this, and his blurred face seemed to reveal a satisfied smile.
0:45:56|0:46:10|After venting in the locked room, [Zhong Xiaonian] gradually calmed down and looked down at the scattered fragments on the floor. Just then, the warm light suddenly turned into cold light. Meanwhile, in the hospital, Zhuang Yi stirred chicken soup and said to [Wei Simeng] lying on the sickbed,
0:46:36|0:46:45|At this moment, [Zhong Xiaonian] used a golf club to remove the partition above the bedroom hole, then climbed to the top of the bookshelf on a treadmill, reaching out with both hands to explore the hole.
0:46:46|0:46:55|On the other side, lying on the hospital bed, [Wei Simeng] was weak but didn't pay much attention to Zhuang Yi. Instead, she took out her phone and said to Zhuang Yi in a video,
0:47:34|0:47:43|Unaware, [Zhong Xiaonian] is climbing up the pipe above the bedroom. The pipe twists and turns, with limited space, forcing him to crawl forward slowly, getting closer to the source of light.
0:47:43|0:47:52|Climbing up the not very long ventilation duct was particularly difficult, the last section of the slope had a large incline, with [Zhong Xiaonian] using his hands to support the wall as he moved forward.
0:47:52|0:48:10|Sitting on the hospital bed, [Wei Simeng] unhesitatingly drinks the chicken soup brought to her by Zhuang Yi. Obviously, she is not afraid that Zhuang Yi will harm her. After finishing the chicken soup, she suppresses her inner reluctance and tearfully says to Zhuang Yi,
0:48:11|0:48:18|After [Wei Simeng] finished speaking, she looked up and stared directly at Zhuang Yi, who was full of admiration upon hearing her words. The scene suddenly shifted to a vast mountain.
0:48:27|0:48:40|[Zhong Xiaonian] tightly gripped the iron frame of the ventilation opening and kept hitting it. A butterfly flew in the air with the wind, not only unaffected by the sound of [Zhong Xiaonian]'s hitting, but also flew towards the iron frame where [Zhong Xiaonian] was.
0:48:40|0:48:47|At this moment, [Zhong Xiaonian] was pleasantly surprised, moving the hand caught on the iron ore slightly, and a small butterfly slowly landed on the iron ore.
0:48:48|0:48:58|He watched the little butterfly flying freely, longing for freedom deep in his heart. On the contrary, in the magnificent Tengyuan Fund, [Tang Wanwan] eagerly walked into the office.
0:48:58|0:49:12|Inserting the key into the computer, [Zhong Xiaonian] furrowed his brow and stared at the scanning process on the screen. The screen then displayed a scanning failure, causing him to slump back in his chair in frustration. He then made a phone call to ask the mysterious person for help.
0:49:23|0:49:33|[Tang Wanwan] threatened the mysterious person, but the mysterious person didn't take it seriously. After putting down the phone, he directed all his anger towards the computer, smashing the keyboard against the monitor.
0:49:33|0:49:44|The mysterious person inserted the real key into the computer, entered the password, and clicked confirm. However, the balance displayed on the screen was only 5 yuan. He repeatedly pressed the enter key, but it always showed 5 yuan.
0:49:45|0:49:48|The voice came from the cluttered phones next to the mysterious person's computer.
0:50:19|0:50:36|[Tian Yu]'s words pierced [Zhong Xiaonian]'s heart. He failed to protect his wife and allowed her to be harmed. Now she was in the hospital, and he couldn't take care of her personally. Locked in this room, cut off from any news from the outside world, [Zhong Xiaonian] felt helpless, clutching the walkie-talkie tightly.
0:50:38|0:50:54|[Zhong Xiaonian], sitting on the edge of the bed covered with a blanket, looked extremely desolate from the back. The once tidy room became a mess, with a big hole in the door, a hairdryer thrown aside, fragments of the broken arm of the Greek goddess scattered everywhere, the glass in the bathroom shattered, and the bedroom in a state of disarray.
0:50:54|0:51:13|Wooden splinters are scattered everywhere, with bookshelves and treadmills forcibly squeezed together, books scattered on both sides of the bookshelf. [Zhong Xiaonian] has been locked in the secret room for the third day, sitting in the corner without any sleepiness, with a small robot in front of him, rotating its body under the drive of electricity.
0:51:14|0:51:28|At 9:30, [Zhong Xiaonian] entered the living room and looked at the two multiple-choice questions that appeared on the screen on time: a. Expose the murder of former CEO Zeng Guangwen of Tengyuan Fund, b. Expose money laundering at Tengyuan Fund.
0:51:30|0:51:38|[Zhong Xiaonian] walked towards the intercom, unplugged the charging intercom and said,
0:52:4|0:52:22|[Zhong Xiaonian] was a bit at a loss. Just as he sat down on the sofa, the screen switched to option B, asking about the whereabouts of the money in the private account. Without hesitation, [Zhong Xiaonian] answered the question and then immediately changed the channel of the walkie-talkie to seek help again, holding the walkie-talkie in both hands.
0:53:51|0:54:2|Shortly after, [Tian Yu] set off in the car to find the direction of [Zhong Xiaonian]. Meanwhile, in the hospital, [Wei Simeng] learned about the cause of [Zhong Xiaonian]'s death through the financial news on TV.
0:54:11|0:54:23|[Wei Simeng] stared at the TV in shock, and when [Tang Wanwan] sat down on the chair next to the hospital bed, [Wei Simeng]'s penetrating eyes left no room for [Tang Wanwan].
0:54:43|0:54:50|Wei Simeng couldn't believe his ears. He didn't even know about the private account, how did he find out?
0:55:3|0:55:18|The boisterous [Wei Simeng] immediately calmed down upon hearing [Tang Wanwan]'s words, her mind went blank, but she still kept hitting [Tang Wanwan]. Then [Tang Wanwan] took out a report from his pocket, the incredulous [Wei Simeng] snatched it away and examined it carefully.
0:55:39|0:55:50|After finishing speaking, [Tang Wanwan] stared at [Wei Simeng] with a gaze that changed from threatening to sinister, then turned and left, leaving [Wei Simeng] sitting on the bed staring intently at the report. Then her fingers touched the ultrasound image on the report, tears streaming down her face.
0:55:50|0:55:57|Thinking of Zhong Xiaonian in his heart, but not having the chance to see this scene. And the voice from the screen in the secret room sounded again,
0:56:52|0:57:5|After saying that, [Zhong Xiaonian] ran to the bedroom, picked up the books on the floor and threw them on the bed. Then he took out a lot of clothes in the dressing room, plugged in the hairdryer, wrapped it with clothes, and then stuffed it into the bed full of clothes and books.
0:57:5|0:57:23|After a while, smoke rose from the bed, and flames ignited at the center of the bed. [Zhong Xiaonian] hoped the fire would become more intense, tearing books apart and throwing them towards the center of the flames. The thick smoke drifted out through the hole directly above the bedroom. Meanwhile, [Tian Yu], who was driving, was frantically weaving through the narrow mountain roads.
0:57:23|0:57:25|Searching for the signal given by [Zhong Xiaonian].
0:57:25|0:57:59|The fire gradually grew larger, thick smoke filled the entire room, and [Zhong Xiaonian] stood next to the fire pit, fanning the smoke towards the opening. At this moment, the walkie-talkie sounded, and dense black smoke drifted into the air from the towering mountains. [Zhong Xiaonian] then climbed up the bookshelf on a treadmill, and crawled out through the ventilation hole, but the thick smoke made it difficult for him to move.
0:57:59|0:58:4|He suddenly remembered something he had forgotten to bring, and angrily climbed down the pipeline.
0:58:6|0:58:26|The thick smoke made him cough repeatedly. After going down, he searched around on the bed, then picked up a pair of pants by the bed and found a ring in the pocket, which he bought at a high price at the auction intending to give to [Wei Simeng]. He then covered his mouth and nose with a handkerchief to block the smoke from entering his nostrils, and climbed up the pipe again, struggling to climb to the top of the pipe.
0:58:26|0:58:44|Just as he propped up his body and reached out to grab the iron frame of the ventilation opening, his feet slipped, causing his whole body to slide down. Suddenly, a section of the long-standing pipeline behind him fell off due to uneven force. [Zhong Xiaonian] quickly grabbed the protruding edge inside the pipe above, which prevented him from falling down.
0:58:47|0:58:57|At this moment, [Tian Yu] quickly locked onto the location upon seeing the thick smoke, and when he noticed a large amount of black smoke coming from the ground, he immediately parked the car on the side and got out to look for [Zhong Xiaonian].
0:59:6|0:59:23|In the pipeline, [Zhong Xiaonian] heard hope and tried his best to climb out. When [Tian Yu] heard the sound, she immediately ran to the car's trunk, took out the towing rope, first fixed one end in front of the car, and then quickly returned to the vent where [Zhong Xiaonian] was located, securely tying the towing rope to the iron frame.
0:59:24|0:59:40|Continuing, [Tian Yu] started the car and reversed, causing the towing rope to tighten in the pull of the power. Inside the ventilation duct, [Zhong Xiaonian] tapped the iron frame with his arm. The thick smoke made it hard for him to breathe, and in desperate need of rescue, he reached out his hand. However, at the moment his hand touched the iron frame, he lost all strength.
0:59:43|0:59:51|[Zhong Xiaonian], who was on the verge of death, fell just one step away from the iron frame. It was so difficult for him, who had no strength left, to take this step now.
0:59:53|1:0:2|Suddenly, with the efforts of [Tian Yu], the iron frame was forcefully pulled open by the strong pulling force of the car. Smoke billowed out of the opening continuously. And at this moment, [Zhong Xiaonian] was still lying inside.
1:0:4|1:0:14|At this moment, [Wei Simeng] sat under the window in the hospital, watching the sun sandwiched between two tall buildings outside the window. After the sunset crossed her face, she slowly lowered her head.
1:0:15|1:0:31|The spacious room, devoid of sunlight, felt lifeless. [Wei Simeng] remained seated by the window, her emotions in turmoil. Suddenly, her phone, placed on the nearby cabinet, vibrated. She picked it up wearily to check the notification.
1:0:31|1:0:38|Although the number was unfamiliar, she still chose to answer the call. So she slowly slid her finger across the screen and put the phone to her ear.
1:0:42|1:0:58|The voice on the phone was [Zhong Xiaonian], causing [Wei Simeng] to cover her mouth in excitement. The person she had been worried about all this time had finally returned. She quickly adjusted her emotions and calmly said,
1:1:20|1:1:27|Wei Simeng, who hung up the phone, was reluctant to put down the phone, immersed in the joy of seeing Zhong Xiaonian, and finally the suspended heart was put down.
1:1:27|1:1:39|At this moment, [Zhong Xiaonian] drove [Tian Yu]'s car on the way home. Skillfully entering the password, he opened all the lights in the room after entering the villa, looking at everything that was both unfamiliar and familiar, filled with regret.
1:1:39|1:1:52|[Zhong Xiaonian] thought to himself that the mysterious person must be after money, so he walked straight into the dressing room. [Tian Yu] followed behind [Zhong Xiaonian] and started recording with a camera.
1:1:53|1:2:14|Sure enough, [Zhong Xiaonian] looked at the empty safe in front of him and felt that his guess was correct. As he checked the safe repeatedly, he suddenly heard the sound of the door. He turned around and walked out of the dressing room to investigate, with [Tian Yu] following behind him using a camera to record, not missing any details.
1:2:14|1:2:24|[Zhong Xiaonian] walked to the corner of the second floor and saw [Wei Simeng] closing the door, but he didn't immediately call out to her. Instead, he watched her anxiously searching for her own figure, his eyes and heart filled with tenderness.
1:2:25|1:2:33|When Wei Simeng didn't see Zhong Xiaonian on the first floor, she decided to go to the second floor. Just as she turned around, she saw Zhong Xiaonian standing on the stairs.
1:2:34|1:2:45|When [Zhong Xiaonian] saw her noticing him, he immediately hid the excitement in his heart and slowly walked down the stairs. Stubborn [Wei Simeng] strode forward and gave [Zhong Xiaonian] a slap, crying as she pounded on his chest.
1:2:47|1:2:53|[Zhong Xiaonian] tightly grabbed [Wei Simeng]'s wrist, calming her down. Finally, [Wei Simeng] spoke up,
1:3:38|1:3:59|[Wei Simeng] turned around disappointedly and faced away from [Zhong Xiaonian], saying insincerely. As [Wei Simeng] sat on the sofa disappointedly, supporting his head with his hand and feeling particularly agitated, a mechanical voice made him look up and he saw [Tian Yu] standing on the stairs.
1:4:3|1:4:14|In the blink of an eye, they appeared at the entrance of an old house. [Zhong Xiaonian] pushed open the door and turned on the lights. [Wei Simeng] then slowly walked in. This was the place where he and [Zhong Xiaonian] lived before they became wealthy.
1:4:16|1:4:32|In the room, everything remained the same, [Wei Simeng] carefully observed the room that held their beautiful memories. She suddenly stopped in her tracks, met eyes with [Zhong Xiaonian], realizing that this man loved her. She then spoke to him,
1:4:44|1:4:56|[Wei Simeng] nodded after listening, then turned and entered the bedroom. She switched on the lights, making the whole room cozy. The bedside lamps illuminated the photo placed on the bedside table, showing the two people in the photo being very close to each other.
1:4:57|1:5:28|Quietly, [Tian Yu] followed behind [Zhong Xiaonian] and placed a bug in his pocket. After speaking, [Zhong Xiaonian] turned his gaze back to [Wei Simeng]. Inside the bedroom, [Wei Simeng] looked at the past with a pensive expression, then turned around to look at [Zhong Xiaonian] standing behind her in tears. On the other side, [Tian Yu] entered the room, turned on the computer, put on headphones, and eavesdropped on the conversation between [Zhong Xiaonian] and [Wei Simeng].
1:6:17|1:6:33|The memories of the past flooded into Wei Simeng's mind, so she set down the lunchbox and hugged Zhong Xiaonian's shoulder, saying,
1:7:16|1:7:26|Suddenly a iron gate was opened, [Zhong Xiaonian] and [Tian Yu] sneaked in. Inside the gate were all kinds of furniture, with [Tian Yu] holding a camera interviewing [Zhong Xiaonian].
1:8:11|1:8:40|Zhong Xiaonian and Tian Yu were flipping through various orders everywhere, making a mess of the orders displayed on the shelves. Suddenly, Tian Yu found Zhong Xiaonian's order and excitedly checked it with him. Zhong Xiaonian took the stack of orders from Tian Yu's hand, sat down on a chair, and carefully examined them. When he turned to the next page with his name, he saw Zeng Guangwen's name instead, and he looked up in shock.
1:9:15|1:9:19|Due to commercial secrets involved, [Zhong Xiaonian] stood up and closed [Tian Yu]'s camera before continuing to speak.
1:9:52|1:10:1|Because the order from Zeng Guangwen was written as Maoyan Hutong, the two of them drove through the rain to the hutong. Due to the narrow space in the hutong, they could only park the car at the corner.
1:10:4|1:10:16|Watching the figure of [Zhong Xiaonian] leaving in the rain, [Tian Yu] sat in the car and put on headphones. [Zhong Xiaonian] walked in the alley that had experienced vicissitudes, and there was an old man burning paper in front of a house, making him feel inexplicably eerie. He quickened his pace and walked towards the innermost part of the alley.
1:10:20|1:10:34|Walking through alleyways, Zhong Xiaonian couldn't find the place he was looking for. However, he noticed a house number on a door and started searching house by house following the numbers. Behind a utility pole, he finally found the house number he was looking for.
1:10:34|1:10:40|Standing in front of the main entrance, [Zhong Xiaonian] first looked around, then walked straight ahead and pushed open the door to walk inside.
1:10:41|1:10:48|Behind the door is a long and narrow corridor, with idle items piled up along the side, while [Zhong Xiaonian] strides forward with agile steps.
1:10:49|1:11:2|He then found himself in a pitch-black courtyard, standing in the center and looking around. The night grew darker, heavy rain poured down recklessly, hitting the black tiles on the roof and making a dripping sound.
1:11:3|1:11:20|At this moment, [Zhong Xiaonian] furrowed his brows in great astonishment. There was not a single person in the spacious courtyard. Could it be that this address was fake? Unwillingly, he looked around repeatedly. After confirming that there was no movement after searching repeatedly, [Zhong Xiaonian] decided to call [Tian Yu] who was sitting in the car.
1:11:20|1:11:26|Just as he took out his phone to make a call, the room behind him suddenly lit up.
1:11:28|1:11:39|He turned his head in surprise to look at the room, and suddenly the lights went out again. Zhong Xiaonian rushed in without stopping, kicking the door open with one foot. Instead of going straight in, he stood at the doorway and looked inside.
1:11:42|1:12:3|He slowly moved towards the room, cautiously observing his surroundings. Then he looked up and found the light switch. Curiosity led him to turn on the light, and as the room was illuminated, everything inside was revealed to him. What he saw shocked him - on the messy table next to the door was a model of the second floor of his villa.
1:12:3|1:12:11|He continued to move inside, and the photos hanging above were all related to him, along with the voice changer device that the mysterious person used to talk to him.
1:12:11|1:12:33|Behind the spinning chair are two rows of screens, all showing static at the moment. Then he saw numerous colorful lines on the wall, intricately pinned with a brush on a portrait of himself. As he was closely observing this astonishing scene, suddenly there was the sound of a bottle falling behind him.
1:12:33|1:12:38|Zhong Xiaonian immediately chased after the mysterious person running out from the room behind.
1:12:39|1:12:51|Just as the mysterious person was about to run out of the room, he tightly embraced the mysterious person from behind, who struggled fiercely in his arms, and then suddenly pushed him down to the ground before running out of the room.
1:12:52|1:13:3|The mysterious figure scattered the idle items on both sides of the aisle onto the road, and at this moment, [Zhong Xiaonian] navigated through each obstacle in the dimly lit aisle, then the two entered the alley to continue the chase.
1:13:4|1:13:13|At the corner of the alley, Zhong Xiaonian tripped over the roadblock in front of him. Seeing this, Wei Simeng accelerated and ran towards Zhong Xiaonian, pinning him down, but ultimately the mysterious person managed to break free.
1:13:16|1:13:30|Tian Yu, who stopped at the corner, tried to block the way with the car, but the mysterious person escaped through the gap. Zhong Xiaonian, who was furious and embarrassed, stood in the rain with hands on hips, panting heavily.
1:13:31|1:13:45|He then took [Tian Yu] to the mysterious room, where she took down a close-up photo of [Zhong Xiaonian]. Meanwhile, [Zhong Xiaonian] picked up a box and looked through the documents inside, but they were of no use to him. Angry, he threw down the documents and looked around.
1:13:45|1:13:51|In the morning of the fourth day, [Zhong Xiaonian] stood by the window, staring blankly outside, listening to the financial news report on TV.
1:14:25|1:14:39|At this moment, [Zhong Xiaonian] stood up straight by the window, lowered his head in shame, then he walked to the dining table where [Wei Simeng] was already waiting. He sat directly across from [Wei Simeng], and then [Wei Simeng] spoke,
1:14:42|1:14:50|After finishing speaking, [Wei Simeng] picked up the noodles in the bowl. However, [Zhong Xiaonian] looked solemnly to the side, and after a glance at [Wei Simeng], he started using his chopsticks.
1:14:54|1:15:8|He first picked up the coriander from the bowl next to him, ready to put it into his own bowl. However, guilt stopped him, and he looked at [Wei Simeng]'s bowl and put the coriander in there instead. But [Wei Simeng] picked up the coriander and put it into the empty bowl next to him. [Zhong Xiaonian] exclaimed in surprise, "..."
1:16:27|1:16:33|Upon hearing these words, [Zhong Xiaonian]'s heart felt even more guilty, as if he really didn't understand [Wei Simeng] well enough.
1:16:52|1:17:7|[Wei Simeng] pours out her heart, trying to persuade the stubborn [Zhong Xiaonian], who hangs his head in silence. It is 9:30 in the morning. At the dining table, [Zhong Xiaonian]'s phone rings, displaying a private number on the screen.
1:17:8|1:17:13|[Zhong Xiaonian] turned away from the dining table to avoid [Wei Simeng], while on the other side, [Tian Yu] put on headphones and eavesdropped on [Zhong Xiaonian] through a bug.
1:18:27|1:18:46|As a wife, [Wei Simeng] decided to help [Zhong Xiaonian] retrieve the money. She came alone to a Japanese restaurant, where [Tang Wanwan] was enjoying the food in a private room. Guided by the waiter, [Wei Simeng] entered the room, and [Tang Wanwan] greeted her with a look of relief and said,
1:18:54|1:19:5|Fearless Wei Simeng pushed the new contract he carried to Tang Wanwan, and after carefully reading the contract, Tang Wanwan's face changed suddenly, and she said sharply,
1:19:46|1:19:53|At this moment, [Tang Wanwan] was silently contemplating. Then [Wei Simeng] found [Zhuang Yi], who was giving a massage.
1:20:34|1:20:39|[Zhuang Yi] lying on the massage bed suddenly turned to look at [Wei Simeng],
1:21:44|1:21:56|In the spacious parking lot, a van slowly moves forward and parks in a spot. A young man gets off the van, looks around, and then throws the car keys in his hand into the nearby trash can.
1:21:56|1:22:12|Hidden in the shadows, [Zhong Xiaonian] watches the young man's every move. Once he leaves, she quickly approaches the trash can where the car keys were thrown, retrieves the keys, and heads towards the back of the van. She opens the trunk, revealing a tightly sealed password-protected door.
1:22:12|1:22:21|[Zhong Xiaonian] then took out his phone and unlocked the password door according to the password displayed on the phone. As the password door opened, a clear view of the gold was revealed.
1:22:21|1:22:32|[Zhong Xiaonian] looked proudly at the car full of gold, then quickly locked the car door. But he didn't realize that things were not that simple. There was something flashing red under the car's tire.
1:22:33|1:22:50|On the other side, in the magnificent and luxurious Tengyuan Fund, the cunning and sly [Tang Wanwan] strides arrogantly along the spacious corridor. He is willing to do whatever it takes for his own benefit. At this moment, he decides to press his advantage, convening an emergency meeting to negotiate stock prices with the company's senior management.
1:22:50|1:22:59|In the meeting room, each screen standing against the wall displayed different data, while [Tang Wanwan] wrote on the whiteboard in the middle and said,
1:23:7|1:23:20|Suddenly, the scene of [Zhu Nan] being murdered appeared on the screen. [Tang Wanwan] looked at the screen in shock, he did not expect his crime to be exposed in this way, while every employee sitting in the middle stared at the screen in astonishment.
1:23:22|1:23:37|In a panic, [Zhong Xiaonian] hurried out of the meeting room to the parking lot, looking around while running to see if anyone was following. As he approached his car, his phone rang. He took out his phone and saw it was a call from [Zhuang Yi]. Without hesitation, he answered.
1:24:9|1:24:16|At this moment, [Zhong Xiaonian] arrived at the agreed place with the mysterious person. He stood on the railway bridge, watching the passing freight trains below, with no emotions in his heart.
1:24:17|1:24:30|Suddenly, footsteps were heard from the other end of the bridge. [Zhong Xiaonian] slowly turned around with his hands in his pockets, looking very calm and composed as he watched the mysterious figure approaching. The mysterious figure kept a safe distance from [Zhong Xiaonian], reaching out to take off the hat on their head.
1:24:33|1:24:42|Now his appearance is completely exposed, holding out the sealed bag in his hand, saying to [Zhong Xiaonian],
1:24:55|1:25:9|After the mysterious person finished speaking solemnly, [Zhong Xiaonian] stepped forward to take the sealed bag, then turned and walked to the other end of the bridge to open the bag and check his information. A loud noise came from the direction where the mysterious person was standing.
1:25:12|1:25:22|[Zhong Xiaonian] turned around and saw a brutal scene. [Tang Wanwan] appeared behind the mysterious person at some point, using an iron rod to strike the mysterious person's head, causing the mysterious person to instantly fall to the ground.
1:25:24|1:25:51|As the passing train lights shone on [Tang Wanwan]'s face, he revealed an evil smile. He then proceeded to repeatedly strike the mysterious person's body with an iron rod. Suddenly, a bold idea struck him. He lifted the barely conscious mysterious person and threw them over the railing of the railway bridge, causing them to fall into a passing train carriage below. With a satisfied smile on his face, [Tang Wanwan] stood at the railing. At that moment, [Zhong Xiaonian] spoke up, saying,
1:25:55|1:25:59|[Tang Wanwan] turned his sinister and cunning face, then bent down to pick up the iron rod on the ground and said,
1:26:50|1:26:57|Upon hearing the sound of the police car, [Tang Wanwan] panicked and dropped the iron rod resting on [Zhong Xiaonian]'s neck, fleeing in a panic.
1:27:12|1:27:36|Tang Wanwan, who is in imminent danger, jumps off the railway bridge and walks on the railway with fences on both sides. Zhong Xiaonian stands on the bridge watching the fleeing Tang Wanwan, feeling heartbroken. Tian Yu, holding a police light, walks up to the bridge and says,
1:27:39|1:27:45|Tian Yu nodded quickly upon hearing this, while Wei Simeng sat on the sofa in the room, anxiously waiting for Zhong Xiaonian to return.
1:27:45|1:28:0|The door suddenly opened, and [Zhong Xiaonian] rushed in from outside. Seeing his lover safely back, [Wei Simeng] stood up excitedly. [Zhong Xiaonian] couldn't wait to share the good news with [Wei Simeng], and the two embraced tightly.
1:28:9|1:28:18|Shortly after, [Zhong Xiaonian] released [Wei Simeng], the two gazed deeply into each other's eyes. Then he took out a ring from his pocket, intending to give this item that had been through life and death with him to [Wei Simeng].
1:28:20|1:28:28|He then lifted [Wei Simeng]'s delicate hand and slowly put the ring on her ring finger. Holding [Wei Simeng]'s hand, he hesitated to let go and said,
1:28:28|1:28:46|[Wei Simeng] nodded with tears in her eyes, seeing her cry so sadly, [Zhong Xiaonian] felt heartbroken and then embraced [Wei Simeng], the two of them deeply snuggled together. At that moment, [Zhong Xiaonian] felt an unprecedented sense of relief.
1:28:46|1:29:0|The mastermind behind the scenes was killed by [Tang Wanwan], and his wife also returned to his side. On the fifth day at 9:11 in the morning, the press conference was held as scheduled. [Zhong Xiaonian] walked up to the platform with heavy steps, while the seats below were filled with buzzing reporters.
1:29:0|1:29:8|Stepping onto the stage, [Zhong Xiaonian] first bowed to the reporters, then said, "I am [Zhong Xiaonian]."
1:30:23|1:30:32|[Zhong Xiaonian] thanked the reporters and turned to leave, it was exactly 9:30. Suddenly the lights went out, and at that moment, [Zhong Xiaonian]'s phone rang.
1:30:32|1:30:46|He had not yet stepped off the stage when he took out his phone to check the messages. The screen showed a bound [Wei Simeng] with a bomb strapped to her. Shocked, he looked up as the phone rang again.
1:30:48|1:30:57|This time, [Zhong Xiaonian] was presented with two new multiple-choice questions sent from a private number: option a, to leave, or option b, to continue the game. Without hesitation, he chose option b.
1:30:57|1:31:16|After making the choice, the lights came on again. The journalists were about to leave, but [Zhong Xiaonian] immediately picked up his phone to check a text message: "Game upgraded. You have only 90 minutes to take off the suit." [Zhong Xiaonian] stood on the platform with a vacant look in his eyes, while the journalists below were all heading out, except for [Tian Yu], who stood in the crowd holding up a camera.
1:31:16|1:31:24|At this moment, [Zhong Xiaonian] looked like a walking dead, returning to the center of the stage.
1:31:24|1:31:47|Reporters gradually turned their attention to [Zhong Xiaonian] in front of them. He took off his coat and threw it aside, then immediately checked the phone placed on the podium. The message instructed him to take off his pants, which puzzled him, but he had no choice but to comply. He unbuckled his belt, unzipped his pants, and directly took them off, throwing them aside.
1:31:47|1:32:5|The journalists in the audience didn't miss any details, watching [Zhong Xiaonian] and constantly asking questions. [Tian Yu] recorded the whole process, while the disheveled [Zhong Xiaonian] gradually became numb, not caring at all about the journalists' gazes. The text messages became even more audacious, even asking him to take off his underwear.
1:32:6|1:32:15|He couldn't bear to imagine the scene that would unfold with only his underwear left on his lower body, let alone think about his future, but he had no other choice but to carry out the task.
1:32:15|1:32:29|When he was about to take off his pants with his hands lifting up his shirt, his action was interrupted by the ringing of his phone, which startled the female journalists present. He immediately checked the message and didn't need to take off anymore, taking something out from under the table.
1:32:29|1:32:43|He gestured to the reporter to stop, then squatted down and pulled back the curtain behind the lectern, revealing a bomb ticking down inside. He furrowed his brow, carefully put on the vest containing the bomb, and fastened the straps securely.
1:32:43|1:32:51|All the reporters present were staring intently at [Zhong Xiaonian], the sound of the interview becoming muffled, and no one could understand his current mood.
1:32:53|1:33:8|On the phone screen, there is a view of a trash can in the square. [Zhong Xiaonian] picks up the phone and runs into the backstage, passing through the security door, and strides outside. The sunlight makes him squint as he looks around for the trash can.
1:33:9|1:33:20|At this moment, the reporter also found [Zhong Xiaonian] backstage. He hurriedly ran to the sides of the square, flipping through the trash cans. He completely ignored the onlookers, with a large number of reporters following closely behind, capturing every exciting moment.
1:33:20|1:33:33|[Zhong Xiaonian] standing in the crowd, overturned the trash can on the ground, pulled out the plastic bag and searched through it barehanded, taking out all the garbage from the bag without finding anything special. Then he stood up to look for other trash cans around.
1:33:35|1:33:48|He then saw a trash can not far away through the crowd, and rushed forward with all his might. A large number of reporters chased after him, but he didn't have time to pay attention. He placed the trash can on the ground and searched carefully, but still found nothing.
1:33:48|1:34:0|He looked despairingly at the sky, then immediately pushed away the reporters surrounding him and ran outside. His only goal now was the trash can. He bypassed the fountain and found a trash can, but this time he didn't lay it flat on the ground.
1:34:0|1:34:13|Instead of searching with his hand, he directly reached in and suddenly felt a bag. He then took out the bag, on which was written "a journalist's life" and "b your wife's life". He immediately hugged the bag to prevent the journalists from taking photos.
1:34:14|1:34:25|As he grasped what was inside, the bag slipped down vertically, revealing the gun held by [Zhong Xiaonian], causing the journalist and passersby to retreat in fear, while [Zhong Xiaonian] himself looked bewildered.
1:34:26|1:34:38|Soon after, he saw his own figure appear on the screen in the square. Just as he helplessly lowered his head, with a loud noise, [Tian Yu] fell into a pool of blood.
1:34:55|1:35:6|This incident unexpectedly resulted in a fatality in public. [Zhong Xiaonian] raised his gun to warn the reporters not to follow him anymore. As he turned around, he saw a van filled with gold parked outside the square, and he ran towards it without hesitation.
1:35:6|1:35:20|In the midst of chaos, he decided to throw away the gun and get into the car. The navigation system in the car showed him a location and asked if he wanted to go there. Without hesitation, he pressed "yes" and the car started moving. Sitting in the car, [Zhuang Yi] listened to the radio.
1:35:33|1:35:54|The ambulance drove away with [Tian Yu] under the gaze of the crowd, while [Zhong Xiaonian] in a van arrived at the target location. Surprisingly, the target location turned out to be a spacious parking lot. After parking the car in the designated spot, he got out to inspect. Anxiously, he searched every corner of the parking lot, but found no one.
1:35:54|1:36:6|At this moment, in a panic, he took out his phone urgently wanting to get new information. What he didn't know was that at the same time, a car also drove into the parking lot where he was. Before long, [Zhong Xiaonian] heard the sound of a car door closing in the distance.
1:36:7|1:36:12|He approached slowly, and as he circled around the pillar to see who it was,
1:36:14|1:36:34|He frowned in disbelief, the person who professed love to him was secretly tormenting and hurting him, now even using his most beloved person to threaten him. [Zhuang Yi] happily walked slowly in high heels to the front of [Zhong Xiaonian], she had come to rescue [Zhong Xiaonian] after learning about this location from the tracker on the van.
1:36:34|1:36:45|Zhong Xiaonian furrowed his brows and said to Zhuang Yi in astonishment,
1:36:50|1:36:58|Approaching the brink of collapse, [Zhong Xiaonian] suddenly hears his phone ringing.
1:37:4|1:37:23|On screen, [Zhuang Yi] and [Zhong Xiaonian] leave the safe box password. [Zhong Xiaonian] pushes [Zhuang Yi] aside and quickly enters the password. The screen displays, "Go to the rooftop, take the stairs."
1:37:27|1:37:34|Suddenly a car rushed out, at this critical moment, [Zhuang Yi] who was holding [Zhong Xiaonian] pushed him out, and she herself was knocked down to the ground.
1:37:35|1:37:54|[Zhong Xiaonian] stared in shock at the dying [Zhuang Yi], then a person got out of the car that hit her, and that person was none other than the escaped [Tang Wanwan]. [Tang Wanwan] calmly turned around to look at the fallen [Zhong Xiaonian], seeming to be thinking about something, then forcefully closed the car door.
1:37:55|1:38:13|[Tang Wanwan] closed the car door and walked straight towards [Zhong Xiaonian], who was petrified and collapsed on the ground. [Tang Wanwan] grabbed the vest he was wearing and dragged him towards the van. Despite his desperate resistance, the strong [Tang Wanwan] didn't give him a chance to catch his breath, and directly threw him into the back of the van.
1:38:13|1:38:24|Zhong Xiaonian struggled to get up and walked into the back of the van. In front of Tang Wanwan, he opened the rear hatch and then put the phone in his hand into the pocket of his vest, sighing.
1:38:29|1:38:40|After speaking, he supported the car body with his hands, entered the password, and then exerted all his strength to open the password door. While opening the door, he secretly hid a piece of gold, and at this moment, Tang Wanwan's eyes were full of gold.
1:38:40|1:38:50|He didn't even notice his small movements. When Tang Wanwan approached to inspect the gold, he used the gold in his hand to hit Tang Wanwan's head.
1:38:54|1:39:7|For the first time, he didn't knock out Tang Wanwan, so he gritted his teeth and swung the gold in his hand towards Tang Wanwan's head again. When Tang Wanwan fell to the ground motionless, he threw the gold into the car, locked the password door, and closed the car door.
1:39:8|1:39:19|Turning around to leave, his gaze swept over [Tang Wanwan], stopping at Zhuang Yi. He stood there feeling sorry for Zhuang Yi, knowing she didn't deserve to do this for him. Then he immediately rushed into the stairwell.
1:39:20|1:39:31|He didn't dare to waste a moment. He didn't know how many floors he had climbed. When his legs were sore and weak, he stuck his head out and looked at the approaching ceiling. With heavy steps, he pushed open the iron door of the rooftop.
1:39:31|1:39:40|[Zhong Xiaonian] rushed out from inside, standing on the rooftop he gasped for breath, his eyes scanning around looking for [Wei Simeng].
1:39:42|1:39:49|Finally, in the middle of the rooftop, Zhong Xiaonian found Wei Simeng. Anxious Zhong Xiaonian immediately ran over and untied the gag from Wei Simeng's mouth.
1:39:55|1:40:4|[Wei Simeng] looked at the bomb on [Zhong Xiaonian] in shock, while [Zhong Xiaonian] crouched next to [Wei Simeng], helping her untie the iron chain that was wrapped around [Wei Simeng] and the chair.
1:40:4|1:40:17|He tried repeatedly without success, so he stood up angrily. Suddenly, he noticed a screen on the side, and then he picked up the remote control placed on the steps and pressed the power button. The two of them stared at the screen, from which came two.
1:40:17|1:40:22|The audio of the conversation between people, you forgot how Zeng Guangwen died, it was his own fault, he didn't do those things, can I catch him with evidence?
1:40:37|1:40:46|A young man walked in slowly, sitting on the sofa facing the camera before revealing his full face. This person is [Tian Yu], who then spoke,
1:41:25|1:41:33|The scene shows [Tian Yu] being taken into the parking lot by an ambulance. He bribed the driver to take away Zhuang Yi on the ground, but then he viciously kicked [Tang Wanwan] next to the van.
1:42:3|1:42:12|[Wei Simeng], who was tied up, quickly shook her head. At this moment, [Zhong Xiaonian] squatted down to study the bomb on [Wei Simeng]'s body. He was trying to remove the bomb, but [Wei Simeng] didn't want him to take this risk.
1:42:24|1:42:35|[Wei Simeng]'s bomb is counting down, with 1 minute and 17 seconds left. [Zhong Xiaonian] kneels down and confesses,
1:43:3|1:43:18|[Zhong Xiaonian] looked sincerely at [Wei Simeng], holding her face in his hands and kissing her deeply. At this moment, the bound [Wei Simeng] was crying bitterly. Seeing that there were only 55 seconds left on the countdown timer around [Wei Simeng]'s waist, [Zhong Xiaonian] said to her with great reluctance,
1:43:20|1:43:27|[Zhong Xiaonian] stood up slowly after finishing speaking, looking at [Wei Simeng] with reluctance, while the tearful [Wei Simeng] spoke in a choked voice,
1:43:27|1:43:48|[Zhong Xiaonian] slowly moved his feet backward, but his eyes remained fixed on [Wei Simeng], pointing a finger at her abdomen. Meanwhile, [Wei Simeng], who was struggling on the chair, kept calling out [Zhong Xiaonian]'s name.
1:43:56|1:44:6|Unable to choose, [Zhong Xiaonian] gradually approached the edge of the balcony. The moment his foot touched the edge of the step, he knew it was time to end it all. Slowly, he lifted his leg and stepped onto the platform.
1:44:7|1:44:14|Standing at the final step of his life, he wanted to take another good look at [Wei Simeng]. As his gaze swept across the waist of [Wei Simeng], he knew he only had 32 seconds left.
