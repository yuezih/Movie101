0:0:49|0:0:56|At the beginning of the film, in an upscale Western restaurant, a lady casually twirls the noodles on her plate with a fork.
0:1:11|0:1:18|The head chef nodded, and the lady invited him to taste. The chef picked up a piece of smoked sausage with a fork and put it in his mouth, while the lady continued to ask.
0:1:22|0:1:25|The woman questioned, turning her head to the group dining together.
0:2:9|0:2:14|The lady proudly took a deep breath and then looked up at the chandelier not far above.
0:2:33|0:2:42|The head chef personally instructs the waiter beside him. The waiter brings over a ladder and climbs up carefully.
0:3:6|0:3:16|Everyone shook their heads. Cheng Yumeng leaned forward and backward, the light bulb no longer reflecting dots of light on the plate. The head chef suddenly realized.
0:3:28|0:3:35|Li Meiling waved her hand nonchalantly. The head chef bowed and left, while Li Meiling sat proudly.
0:4:9|0:4:13|[Cheng Yumeng] smiled sweetly, and after the meal, everyone prepared to leave.
0:4:27|0:4:29|Cheng Yumeng elegantly got into the car.
0:4:32|0:4:44|In the business car, Cheng Yumeng turned her head to look at the people outside the restaurant getting further and further away. She then wearily closed her eyes and rested against the seat.
0:4:56|0:5:16|[Cheng Yumeng] opened his wallet, which only had a few hundred yuan inside. He handed the money to the driver. Then he leaned back in his seat again, closed his eyes to rest, but his heart felt heavy as if weighed down by a stone.
0:5:18|0:5:43|Not long after, he opened his eyes and looked out the window. The city's night was colorful, with lights shining on his face. Inside the subway station, Cheng Yumeng inserted a few coins to buy a subway ticket, and his backpack slowly passed through the luggage security machine. He took the backpack, passed through the ticket check, and walked up the stairs to the waiting area.
0:5:43|0:6:4|A train pulls into the station. Cheng Yumeng steps into the now less crowded late-night subway, sits down expressionless, and the doors close. Getting off the subway, he enters a convenience store and buys a few skewers of oden with some loose change.
0:6:4|0:6:14|Later, he walked slowly and wearily back home, the high heels tapping on the pavement. There were few vehicles on the road, and under the dim lights, there was only [Cheng Yumeng] alone.
0:6:16|0:6:40|Under the residential building, the dark alley is filled with bicycles, and someone is leaving while pushing a bicycle. He walks into the building, through one dim staircase after another, passing by the stove on the side of the corridor, and returns to his own room. Turning on the light, taking out the key, and closing the door.
0:7:18|0:7:27|The chief editor stopped directing the staff shooting and walked forward. The chief editor glared at the staff member eating instant noodles. A boy was handing breakfast to a girl, and the chief editor raised an eyebrow at their office desk.
0:7:44|0:7:51|Arriving at the editor-in-chief's office, the editor first opened the first piece of paper on the office whiteboard, which was filled with many photos. Looking at these photos, [Cheng Yumeng] couldn't help but smile.
0:8:48|0:9:3|You suddenly tell me to go to Nepal. Even if you describe the place so well, isn't the gap too big? The editor-in-chief, expressionless, looked at Cheng Yumeng, then put down the biscuit in his hand and stood up.
0:10:3|0:10:13|The editor pointed to the four big characters on the whiteboard that read "I am very happy", then he walked to the table and opened a can of Red Bull.
0:10:18|0:10:21|He took a sip of Red Bull and continued speaking.
0:11:3|0:11:19|[Cheng Yumeng] gave a sweet smile to the editor-in-chief, but the next moment she put away the smile, showing a sense of loss and helplessness, turning around to look at the words "I am very happy" on the wall. The day of departure has arrived, inside the airport terminal, several older sisters from the tour group were eating oranges and chatting.
0:11:31|0:11:46|[Cheng Yumeng] walked disgustedly to the airport bookstore, picked up a book and flipped through it. At the airport exit, the tour group leader pointed at the sign for the "Journey of Happiness" and waited. [Wang Can] came out pushing his luggage, looking drunk, swaying with his phone in hand, and greeted the tour leader.
0:11:50|0:12:13|The older sisters placed their luggage in the back of the tour bus and quickly got on board. When Na Jie got on the bus and pushed the door, she accidentally stepped on [Wang Can]'s foot who was lying on the seat, causing him to wake up groggily. [Wang Can] then casually grabbed a short-haired girl who had just boarded the bus.
0:12:13|0:12:17|The girl took out a towel from her bag, got off the car, and poured the mineral water in her hand onto the towel.
0:12:55|0:13:12|[Cheng Yumeng] glanced at everyone, showing dissatisfaction towards [Wang Can]. The helpful [Restaurant Girl] kept her head down, looking at her phone with photos of Nepal, each captioned with serene and profound, temple spiritual power, Buddha's light enveloping. The look in [Restaurant Girl]'s eyes revealed her anticipation for this trip.
0:13:13|0:13:37|During the bus ride to transfer to the plane, [Restaurant Girl] kept browsing everything about Nepal on her phone. In the blink of an eye, they had arrived at Kathmandu International Airport. The tour guide, Rajin, kept waving a paper that read "Happy Journey".
0:13:42|0:13:49|The journey of happiness begins here, [Cheng Yumeng] opens QQ space and writes in the caption.
0:15:12|0:15:20|[Wang Can] walked out of the shop that the two had just passed, he looked at the two walking ahead with a disdainful expression, then turned and walked in the opposite direction.
0:15:24|0:15:35|Tour guide La Xing stood in front of a statue in Duba Square. The elder sisters played with hundreds of pigeons on the square, while La Xing led the tour group and explained as they walked.
0:15:41|0:15:57|Li Meiling takes photos with her phone, capturing the monks, foreign tourists, and Buddha statues that make up this place. Photography enthusiasts in the tour group aim their DSLR cameras at local children and various unique features, snapping away. Cheng Yumeng writes in the unreliable travel companion group.
0:16:5|0:16:20|Cheng Yumeng and the others visited local jewelry stores, clothing stores, and street vendors. Cheng Yumeng walked on the street, observing the people coming and going, when an old man passed by and made eye contact with him.
0:16:44|0:16:57|The next day, the journey continued. Wang Can tried on various gloves, while Cheng Yumeng stood in the middle of the street holding a map, frowning as he watched the cars and people passing by. He sighed and put down the map, then looked up at the sky.
0:16:57|0:17:3|In the afternoon, Cheng Yumeng brought everyone to a hotel courtyard, where they left their shoes and luggage on the entrance carpet.
0:17:18|0:17:31|[Wang Can] also arrived at the entrance. He didn't take off his shoes, but stepped over everyone's shoes and luggage. Everyone sat down on the cushions one by one, and when they crossed their legs, there would be occasional sounds of bones folding.
0:18:0|0:18:5|La Xing sat cross-legged next to the Zen master, translating for everyone.
0:18:21|0:18:23|[Cheng Yumeng] is absent-minded.
0:18:34|0:18:46|Laxin leaned in and whispered to the Zen master, who nodded slightly with a smile. Laxin put his hands together in a prayer gesture.
0:18:48|0:18:52|Cheng Yumeng nonchalantly pursed her lips, while the Zen master noticed Wang Can.
0:19:29|0:19:33|In the memory, Wang Can's father and friends reached an agreement at the golf course.
0:19:59|0:20:1|Wang Can walks in the yard while talking.
0:20:11|0:20:18|He placed both hands on the Zen master's shoulders, with only one thing in mind, to pull his heart and move his hands away.
0:20:51|0:20:59|Laxin pushed [Wang Can] back to the cushion and sat down, then hurried back to the side of the Zen master, clasped his hands together, bowed, and then knelt down to continue translating for the Zen master.
0:21:4|0:21:24|In the memory, at the wedding of [Wang Can], the bride was entering with her father. The wedding invitation stated, "Whoever comes is a true friend." The flower girl was happily scattering petals in front, but as the bride entered, she saw [Wang Can]'s ex-girlfriends all dressed in black, sitting in a row, glaring at her.
0:21:24|0:21:30|The bride, with a displeased expression, stopped walking and whispered to her father just as [Wang Can] reached out a hand.
0:21:35|0:21:40|The choir members were also in a panic, not knowing what to do, so the bride and her father turned and left.
0:22:13|0:22:18|At this moment, [Wang Can] sat down next to the Zen master and grabbed his hand.
0:22:51|0:23:2|The monk angrily pulled away his hand caught by [Wang Can], and demonstrated by placing his hand on his knee, then clasping his hands together.
0:23:22|0:23:36|[Wang Can] listened intently, by now the sky had turned dark, a gust of wind blew out half of the candles placed in the courtyard, leaving only a few flickering. It was only then that [Wang Can] came back to his senses, and the next day they continued their happy journey under the guidance of Lixin.
0:23:42|0:23:45|It's the goddess temple in Nepal where the living goddess is worshipped.
0:24:12|0:24:20|The chosen girl at the end is worshipped by everyone. During the festival, she will also be invited to parade.
0:24:24|0:24:34|The origin of the goddess is presented in animation on the screen. When the little goddess grows up, her term ends, she will be given a sum of money, and then sent back to the mortal world.
0:24:40|0:24:43|But the goddess only accepts worship from Hindus.
0:25:24|0:25:47|It's [Wang Can]'s turn to look into the house. He turns around to find Laxin. [Cheng Yumeng] is also curious, and as she watches, she overhears the conversation between [Wang Can] and Laxin, causing her to furrow her brows slightly. Laxin and [Wang Can] suddenly start fighting in the courtyard, and members of the tour group quickly step forward to intervene.
0:25:50|0:26:3|Everyone thought La Xing was bullying others, so they helped Wang Can fight back. Cheng Yumeng rushed over. The two didn't stop, and the scene was chaotic. Wang Can wanted to step forward, but Cheng Yumeng stood in front of La Xing.
0:26:12|0:26:22|Li Rexue was anxious on the side, everyone looked at [Wang Can]. [Wang Can] was at a loss for a moment, he walked to the side to calm down, then walked forward again, pointing at La Xing.
0:26:25|0:26:30|La Xing held back his anger and didn't approach, [Wang Can] defiantly walked to the side and sat down.
0:26:32|0:26:35|[Wang Can] tidied up his hair, while the others looked at [Cheng Yumeng] in confusion.
0:26:39|0:27:4|Everyone turned in shock to look at [Wang Can], who still had a defiant look on his face. Tears welled up in Laxing's eyes, but he held back, trying hard to keep a dignified expression and gradually calm his anger. He walked slowly towards the front. Laxing glanced at [Wang Can], then turned to look at the rest of the tour group.
0:27:7|0:27:30|He slowly spoke. Everyone stood still, feeling embarrassed about their impulsive actions just now. La Xing felt helpless at everyone's misunderstanding. He turned around, stood up straight with his feet together, straightened his clothes, and then knelt down in front of the goddess temple.
0:27:32|0:27:41|Several people in the tour group looked ashamed, Cheng Yumeng clasped his hands together and silently recited something, then they started bowing one after another.
0:27:41|0:27:55|[Wang Can] thought that La Xing's behavior was overreacting, everyone felt helpless. Nuo Bai gestured to the people around, and gradually everyone dispersed, leaving only [Li Meiling] looking at La Xing with reluctance, while [Cheng Yumeng] glared angrily at [Wang Can].
0:28:5|0:28:17|Laxin kept bowing repeatedly, slowly and forcefully, as if apologizing to the goddess for the commotion in the courtyard just now. This is the devout faith of Nepal, which tolerates no blasphemy.
0:28:18|0:28:27|The journey continues, with everyone sitting on the bus, not in high spirits. Outside the bus, people holding flags can be seen marching. The broadcast inside the bus plays.
0:28:39|0:28:45|The tour group climbed a long flight of stairs to reach the Monkey Temple on the western hilltop of Kathmandu, where monkeys were everywhere.
0:29:8|0:29:12|Many people are burning incense and worshipping Buddha. [Cheng Yumeng] and [Li Meiling] are resting on a high platform.
0:29:22|0:29:24|[Cheng Yumeng] smiled slightly.
0:29:34|0:29:37|[Cheng Yumeng] nodded, listening attentively.
0:29:41|0:29:43|Seeing the bag of blood raised by [Li Meiling], her boyfriend almost lost his balance.
0:30:52|0:30:55|Innocent and passionate, guessed by [Cheng Yumeng].
0:31:2|0:31:9|But he needs time to digest this. [Cheng Yumeng] nodded with a worried expression.
0:31:32|0:31:40|Li Meiling stared at Cheng Yumeng with innocent eyes, while Cheng Yumeng gazed into the distance as if contemplating something, as if she had already seen through everything in her heart.
0:31:47|0:32:3|In the distance, densely packed buildings nestle at the foot of the mountain, and the evening bells ring in the surrounding temples. Behind them is a pagoda with a white tower body and a golden tower top, with four Buddha eyes on the tower body overlooking all beings.
0:32:3|0:32:15|The pagoda is surrounded by a row of prayer wheels, with a group of monks spinning the wheels clockwise while chanting blessings. Devout followers also gently touch the pagoda with their foreheads.
0:32:17|0:32:36|A bus is driving on a rural road, traveling from Kathmandu to Chitwan, a five-hour journey. The bus is packed with passengers, some seats even have luggage on them. The camera pans up to show many pieces of luggage on the bus roof, and a few people sitting on top, holding onto the railings on both sides, including [Cheng Yumeng].
0:32:36|0:32:42|He stared ahead blankly as the bus swayed and rumbled through the mountains, the roof shaking violently.
0:32:43|0:33:5|[Cheng Yumeng] turned around and frowned at the woman sitting next to her, holding a child. The woman, who had been lost in thought, noticed her and smiled at her. [Cheng Yumeng] responded with a gentle smile. After watching the boy being tightly embraced by his mother for a while, [Cheng Yumeng] gradually felt sad as memories flooded back.
0:33:30|0:33:35|At that moment, watching another family gathering in the restaurant, [Cheng Yumeng] couldn't hide her longing.
0:33:44|0:34:1|On the roadside, [Cheng Yumeng] was still lost in thought. Gradually coming back to reality, [Cheng Yumeng] looked up at the distant sky, glanced at her watch, and saw a motorcycle approaching her from afar.
0:34:17|0:34:32|[Cheng Yumeng] arrived at the hotel, frowning at the animal specimens soaked in formalin in the lobby. There were also decorations of rhinoceroses, crocodiles, and other animals in the lobby. [Cheng Yumeng] walked up to the second floor and looked down from the window. There was an outdoor swimming pool below, and at this moment, [Cheng Yumeng] was deeply troubled.
0:34:33|0:34:39|At night, the ceiling fan in the room is slowly spinning. [Cheng Yumeng] is on the phone with the editor, sitting on the edge of the bed and opening her laptop.
0:38:14|0:38:19|Here, [Cheng Yumeng] sits on the bed, staring blankly at the title of the manuscript on the computer, shouting at the center of the world, I am so happy.
0:38:38|0:38:53|Suddenly, all the lights went out, leaving only the computer screen lit up, with darkness outside the room. In the hole in the wall, the flames of two candles flickered in the wind, as [Cheng Yumeng] cautiously walked towards the door with a flashlight. She leaned out, shouting loudly.
0:39:0|0:39:3|"The surroundings were too quiet, any movement was amplified."
0:39:4|0:39:29|He swept around with a flashlight, and in the distance, a toad was slowly hopping on a stone pedestal. [Cheng Yumeng] cautiously moved forward, occasionally startled by noises from the trees, shining the flashlight around. The surroundings were pitch black, shrouded in thick fog. He was timid and tense, walking along the edge of the swimming pool.
0:39:29|0:39:54|He closely observed the surrounding environment, his eyes filled with fear. Suddenly, several frogs jumped to his feet. He took a few steps back. It was only then that he noticed that on this road, by the side of the pool, there were frogs everywhere. Some were lying still, some were jumping around.
0:39:54|0:39:58|He dodged the toads and quickly ran towards the hotel lobby.
0:40:2|0:40:27|He looked through the glass window from outside the hotel lobby to observe the inside of the house, then walked to the door. He tried to push the door open, but it was locked from the inside with a chain. He kept calling for the tour guide, but no one answered. He stomped his feet in frustration and helplessness before reluctantly leaving. [Cheng Yumeng] felt scared and helpless, and walked around the nearby streets in a daze.
0:40:29|0:40:34|Suddenly, he saw someone in a room lighting candles with a lighter, and then closing the curtains.
0:40:37|0:40:40|He ran to the door of this room and spoke from inside the room.
0:40:49|0:40:51|The people in the room looked at him with a candle in hand, then pulled the curtain closed.
0:41:10|0:41:22|He slowly turned around, helplessly crouching at the door, tightly gripping a flashlight.
0:41:58|0:42:3|While filling out the transfer form, I cried.
0:42:48|0:42:53|Shanghai is especially bright, with light everywhere.
0:43:49|0:44:16|He poured out all his grievances here, suddenly a bell sound caught his attention. He turned to look in the direction of the bell sound. He walked into the woods, bowing his head to avoid the tangled branches. He saw a row of copper bells hanging on the branches, swaying in the wind.
0:44:19|0:44:44|Under the tree, there is a small Buddha statue with five candles lit in front of it. He looks at the statue, tears falling down his cheeks. The sound from afar startles Cheng Yumeng. A baby elephant emerges from the woods and slowly walks towards him.
0:44:47|0:45:17|The small elephant, slightly taller than Cheng Yumeng, with painted patterns on its forehead, stands still staring at the baby elephant. The baby elephant slowly stops in front of it. It reaches out to touch the baby elephant's forehead, then leans its own head against it, gently touching the baby elephant's forehead.
0:45:26|0:45:49|At this moment, he gradually eased his fear, and in the darkness, the baby elephant quietly stayed by his side. The next morning, with the owner riding in front controlling the baby elephant, [Cheng Yumeng] sat in the howdah on the elephant's back, while KC walked on the ground.
0:45:51|0:46:2|They walked through the wilderness, passing by students on their way to school, and finally arrived at the riverbank. The baby elephant was lying in the river, spraying water with its trunk, playing with [Cheng Yumeng].
0:46:4|0:46:19|[Wang Can] slipped from the elephant into the water, scooping up water and splashing it onto the elephant. [Wang Can]'s hair was wet and sparkling, she looked as happy as a child. Several local women washing clothes by the river also smiled at the scene.
0:46:19|0:46:34|She was playing with water guns with KC by the river, then gently cuddled a baby elephant, caressing its trunk. At the entrance of the hotel lobby, tourists on a minibus were unloading luggage in preparation for check-in.
0:46:38|0:47:6|[Wang Can] covered in mud, was dragged back to the hotel entrance in the alley. The passing vehicles raised dust, and a red convertible sports car drove towards the hotel. A person stood in the back seat of the car, facing the dust head-on, and turned to avoid it. Through the swirling dust, the sports car drove into the hotel.
0:47:9|0:47:31|The man was lying on the back seat, slowly sat up with his head full of dust. It turned out to be [Wang Can]. He jumped out of the car, took off his sunglasses, stomped his feet, and patted the back of his head.
0:47:31|0:47:38|Cheng Yumeng came out of the hotel lobby and saw Wang Can hesitate for a moment. Wang Can sneered and casually approached him.
0:48:11|0:48:17|During the day, they went into the forest to have tea, drink water, take a shower, and in the evening, when the host rang the bell, they all went home.
0:48:36|0:48:39|Cheng Yumeng was speechless and stopped in her tracks.
0:48:44|0:48:50|[Cheng Yumeng] glared at him and continued walking forward. [Wang Can] laughed.
0:48:53|0:49:5|[Wang Can] angrily glanced at the group of water buffaloes being driven by the owner behind him, and then continued to follow them. As the sun set in the west, [Cheng Yumeng] was still driving his own water buffaloes home.
0:49:7|0:49:14|Next to two straw sheds, people lit a bonfire, musicians played local folk songs, and a peacock was displaying its feathers.
0:49:19|0:49:40|Local residents and tourists formed a circle, with bonfires, musicians, and peacocks inside. Some people waved sticks, locals played flutes and drums, and everyone swayed to the rhythm. Cheng Yumeng and Wang Can also joined in, with everyone showing bright smiles.
0:49:49|0:50:8|Night falls, a straw shed turned into a small bar, with a circular bar surrounded by tourists drinking and chatting. [Cheng Yumeng] sits alone, sipping on a drink and lost in thought. [Wang Can] walks over with a drink in hand and sits next to [Cheng Yumeng]. KC is on the other side of the bar, instructing everyone to pass their passports to the two of them.
0:50:21|0:50:29|The two of them picked up the wrong passports. [Wang Can] couldn't stop laughing when he saw the name on Cheng Yumeng's passport, leaving the foreign tourists puzzled. Cheng Yumeng caught up with [Wang Can].
0:50:33|0:50:40|Cheng Yumeng snatched back the Edo lantern and sat back at the bar, with Wang Can laughing and covering his stomach as he followed her.
0:51:0|0:51:8|I warn you, Cheng Yumeng angrily leaves the bar, sits down at a table in the grass, with Wang Can sitting next to her.
0:52:14|0:52:21|[Wang Can] looked proud. [Cheng Yumeng] kicked over [Wang Can]'s chair, trapping him underneath.
0:52:42|0:52:45|[Cheng Yumeng] stood on a stool and glared at him fiercely.
0:53:24|0:53:40|[Cheng Yumeng] stomped on a stool before finally sitting down on the side. [Wang Can] moved the stool on him to the side, sat up with a displeased look on his face, pointed at [Cheng Yumeng] with his hand, but didn't know what to say.
0:54:0|0:54:7|Cheng Yumeng still had tears on her face, Wang Can supported his waist and was about to leave, but then turned back as he walked.
0:55:27|0:55:30|At that moment, Li Meiling overturned things on the table.
0:55:36|0:55:38|She tore off the information on the wall.
0:55:51|0:55:59|[Cheng Yumeng] is a kind of monster in the Classic of Mountains and Seas. It has a human-like appearance, but with a pair of very short wings.
0:56:5|0:56:9|[Cheng Yumeng] lives in [Cheng Yumin Republic] Ridge, which is located next to the mountain.
0:56:54|0:56:59|Cheng Yumeng, with tears in her eyes, slowly turned around and stood up, looking at [Wang Can].
0:57:16|0:57:20|After speaking, Cheng Yumeng left. Wang Can stood in place watching him leave.
0:57:23|0:57:41|On the way back, there was a narrow bridge over the river, surrounded by darkness. [Cheng Yumeng] walked quickly ahead, with [Wang Can] closely following him with a backpack. After crossing the bridge, they heard the sound of bells on a water buffalo along the path they had taken earlier. [Cheng Yumeng] stopped in his tracks, and [Wang Can] noticed a water buffalo.
0:57:45|0:58:7|At this moment, the night sky is filled with twinkling stars. [Cheng Yumeng] seems to be lost like a water buffalo. On the other side, [Wang Can] is still sitting by the campfire, playing with a peacock feather in his hand, lost in thought.
0:58:12|0:58:24|In the hotel room, [Cheng Yumeng] kept looking at herself in the mirror. She sat on the edge of the bed for a while, then turned off the light and went to sleep.
0:58:32|0:58:55|Before long, there was singing outside the house. In the darkness, [Cheng Yumeng] checked the time on her phone and saw that it was 1 a.m. She turned on the light, got up, walked to the door, and pulled back the curtain, squinting as she looked outside. Identifying the source of the music, she opened the door, leaned out, and with one hand on her hip, spoke out towards the outside.
0:59:3|0:59:12|In the swimming pool, a few people are playing in the snow. Two women by the pool are dancing to the music, and as they approach, he calls out to these Indians again.
0:59:13|0:59:21|Finally, the Indians stopped and looked at her. Cheng Yumeng politely asked. The woman didn't understand, Cheng Yumeng added.
0:59:22|0:59:35|The woman still didn't understand why the man in the pool, and the man didn't understand either. The old man sitting on the lounge chair lowered his voice. [Cheng Yumeng] then turned and left, she returned to the room, drew the curtains, lay down, and covered herself with a blanket.
0:59:37|0:59:56|Just a couple of seconds later, the music was turned up again, and the group cheered and became more lively. [Cheng Yumeng], with her face covered, found it hard to fall asleep. She unhappily lifted the blanket covering her face. Then, in anger, she pulled back the curtain and returned to their side.
1:0:6|1:0:22|Others also mocked him, and he angrily left and walked back. On the way, he saw [Wang Can] pause for a moment, then continue walking back to the room. [Wang Can] also looked like he hadn't slept well, staggering towards the pool, and even bumped his head on a children's clothing hanging under the eaves.
1:0:24|1:0:31|[Cheng Yumeng] pulls down the curtain and sulks. [Wang Can] arrives at the edge of the pool. The man in the water says.
1:0:34|1:0:54|Hearing the noise, [Cheng Yumeng] lifted the curtain and looked outside. [Wang Can] walked past the woman who despised him, while several Indians were still enjoying themselves. At this moment, [Wang Can] pushed a cart slowly towards them. The cart was piled with steaming cow dung.
1:0:56|1:1:20|The woman avoided the car. [Wang Can] pushed the cow dung and the car into the pool. The man in the water quickly climbed out, and [Wang Can] turned and walked back. The Indians were very angry, but [Wang Can] ignored them. On the way back, [Wang Can] saw [Cheng Yumeng] watching them from the room.
1:2:0|1:2:15|KC helped [Cheng Yumeng] put the luggage in [Wang Can]'s sports car. [Wang Can] was lying in the back seat with his feet on the body of the car, and [Cheng Yumeng] pushed his feet down. [Wang Can] sat up, and [Cheng Yumeng] got into the car and sat in the back seat.
1:2:19|1:2:39|[Wang Can] continued to lie down, with his feet propped up behind [Cheng Yumeng]. [Cheng Yumeng] waved goodbye to KC. The shops along the street had already closed, and some people were riding motorcycles with flags attached to the back. The motorcycles passed by them one after another, as [Cheng Yumeng] rested with his head supported by his hand, eyes closed.
1:3:48|1:3:52|I'll have Xiao Lin from the advertising department cover for you.
1:4:26|1:4:36|Xiao Chen, stop asking me for a sense of security all the time. Hanging up the phone, [Chen Yumeng] looked particularly melancholy, as the sports car drove onto a road next to the farmland, where a long line of cars was already stuck ahead.
1:5:6|1:5:14|[Wang Can] struggled to sit up, then jumped out of the car from the side. He furrowed his brow and looked curiously into the distance.
1:5:18|1:5:32|Many people were waving flags and shouting. Men stood on tractors holding up flags, while women surrounded them or stood behind them. Wang Can also joined them, standing in a higher position, filming with his phone and shouting along.
1:5:32|1:5:43|In the car, [Cheng Yumeng] put on headphones to listen to music, opened her computer to start writing, with a serious expression. She looked up to think, but was distracted by a voice from the side.
1:5:47|1:6:12|In the side field, there is a bamboo swing set up, with two children standing on it happily swinging, while several girls are kicking a soccer ball in the field. Watching the innocent children, [Cheng Yumeng] gradually smiles, but immediately falls into sadness. She shakes her head and continues to focus on writing.
1:6:19|1:6:34|On the other side, [Wang Can] was still having a great time in the crowd, holding his phone and taking selfies with many people. Meanwhile, [Cheng Yumeng]'s computer showed a low battery warning and randomly went black. She became anxious and frustrated, hitting the computer and pulling off her headphones, looking into the distance.
1:6:34|1:6:46|She stood up on the car, a row of motorcycles with chess pieces inserted passed by her. On the distant bridge, vehicles were stuck in a traffic jam.
1:6:49|1:6:58|Some women and children grew weary while waiting. [Wang Can] returned with the driver, and [Cheng Yumeng] stepped forward.
1:7:4|1:7:11|[Cheng Yumeng] turned around and walked to the back of the car to open the trunk, preparing to take the luggage down, but was stopped by [Wang Can].
1:7:35|1:7:39|[Cheng Yumeng] frowned and turned around to look at [Wang Can] helplessly.
1:7:52|1:8:5|They then drove away from the protest-caused traffic jam and took another route to Bokala. At night, they lit a bonfire in the wilderness to rest.
1:8:10|1:8:14|There is no one in the wilderness at night.
1:8:21|1:8:28|[Wang Can] opened two suitcases and propped them up together to form a tent-like structure, then carefully crawled inside and lay down, with [Cheng Yumeng] wrapping a shawl around him.
1:8:44|1:8:54|[Wang Can] looked up at him defiantly, then slumped back down. [Cheng Yumeng] sat by the tree, opened the suitcase and covered her legs with it, staring blankly at the bonfire.
1:9:17|1:9:33|Wang Can turned to look at the sky, lost in thought. He opened the luggage that was placed together and then sat down next to [Cheng Yumeng].
1:10:35|1:10:41|[Cheng Yumeng] was speechless, leaning back against the tree with her eyes closed. Wang Can could only leave uninterestingly.
1:10:44|1:10:54|At this moment, Wang Can put on a snake-shaped glove, hid behind the luggage and extended a hand, opening and closing it in sync with his words.
1:11:9|1:11:11|He hid behind the luggage again.
1:12:14|1:12:31|Cheng Yumeng couldn't help but lower his head and smirk on the suitcase, while Wang Can sang and danced vigorously in front of him. The night sky in Nepal was clear, with stars shining densely in the sky, and Cheng Yumeng's tense nerves finally relaxed a bit.
1:12:39|1:12:54|The next day they continued on their journey, with Wang Can still singing loudly in the mountains.
1:13:16|1:13:20|At this point, they have bypassed the congested area and are only forty kilometers away from Bokara.
1:13:26|1:13:43|Outside of Bokala City, a long line of cars is stuck on the road between rural terraces. Police officers, armed with guns and shields, stand in formation at the far end. Protesters also line up, holding signs and banners, shouting loudly the words on the banners, fighting for their dreams and securing their livelihoods.
1:13:46|1:13:59|[Cheng Yumeng] and [Wang Can] have successfully met up with the tour group and are now stuck here. The photography enthusiasts in the group have been busy taking pictures. Laxin rushes back from a distance, and Cheng Yumeng stops him.
1:14:24|1:14:28|On the hillside in the distance, the older sisters in the tour group have been watching the protest scene in the distance.
1:14:30|1:14:35|Protesters are getting closer to the police, who are prepared with determined looks in their eyes.
1:14:38|1:14:56|Wang Can sat on the hilltop, looking out, and Lily handed him a can of Red Bull. Cheng Yumeng sat under the pavilion behind Wang Can, Li Meiling handed him a Red Bull. Cheng Yumeng smiled and accepted it, and Li Meiling sat down next to him. Suddenly, a group of people shouting slogans approached them.
1:14:56|1:15:1|[Li Meiling] quickly stood up and used her phone to record as this group of people handed out small pieces of paper to each person in the tour group.
1:15:10|1:15:14|Above is printed in English "Fighting for Dreams, Securing Life".
1:16:10|1:16:26|With Cheng Yumeng staring at him with furrowed brows, the protesters continued to shout loudly. On a platform downwind from the protest site, children were happily kicking a soccer ball.
1:16:55|1:16:59|Cheng Yumeng's eyes were already red, and Li Meiling listened quietly, feeling a bit downcast.
1:17:32|1:17:48|At this point, the protesters became more agitated. Several men brought many rubber tires, lit them on fire in the middle, and threw them at the police. The members of the tour group became tense, watching the protest scene in the distance.
1:17:52|1:18:9|Protesters pushed aside the iron wire barriers set up by the police and charged forward. The front row of police officers stood shoulder to shoulder, holding long sticks to block the protesters, while some confronted the police with shields. At that moment, two police officers knelt down and fired smoke bombs into the sky, causing the protesters to retreat.
1:18:9|1:18:17|A group of protesters holding signs and banners passed by the tour group and ran towards the protest site. [Wang Can] kept watching them.
1:18:19|1:18:41|At this moment, the protest scene descended into chaos as protesters began to clash with the police. Watching this unfold, [Wang Can] crushed the can of Red Bull in his hand, further adding to the chaos. Angered, he threw the can to the ground and then walked towards Cheng Yumeng.
1:18:49|1:18:59|[Wang Can] smiled, turned around, and took off his shirt, leaving only the vest inside. He picked up a thick wooden stick from the ground and tied the shirt to one end of the stick, leaving Cheng Yumeng puzzled.
1:19:7|1:19:16|[Wang Can] smiled slightly, then lit the shirt on the stick. He raised the torch.
1:19:36|1:19:41|Cheng Yumeng hands the bag to Lily. Then, in a hurry, Li Meiling excitedly follows and runs ahead.
1:19:49|1:20:7|Li Meiling followed suit. Na Jie and the rest of the tour group didn't know what to do. Wang Can had already rushed to the protest site with a torch. Protesters picked up fruits from the ground and threw them at the police before running away. Some police officers subdued the protesters, while Wang Can vigorously threw the torch into the scene.
1:20:10|1:20:31|The police chased protesters running past them, panic filled the air. Rushing to the scene, [Wang Can] was helping a protester break free. [Li Meiling] followed closely behind, a protester fell to the ground, clutching his waist in pain. [Li Meiling] ran through the crowd and squatted beside him, asking if he was okay.
1:20:33|1:20:45|Na Jie and the rest of the tour group arrived here one after another. They ran forward against the direction of the police chase, making way for the protesters. The men stopped the police in front, while the women helped the injured protesters from behind.
1:20:45|1:20:57|Li Meiling and La Xing helped the protester who fell on the ground, the banner dropped to the ground, and feet stepped on it. Na Jie and others helped the injured protesters run together, with Wang Can running to the front.
1:21:0|1:21:19|The protester being supported was crying out in pain, causing chaos on the scene. At this moment, the tour bus arrived at the scene, and the crowd surrounding the scene made way for the bus. [Cheng Yumeng] stood at the door of the bus, looking out, holding up a Chinese flag and reaching it outside the bus. The tour group members ran towards the bus.
1:21:26|1:21:41|Reluctant to leave, [Li Meiling] was carried by the men in the group to the bus, with Wang Can following behind. The bus slowly moved forward as Cheng Yumeng kept waving a flag, while Wang Can and [Li Meiling] stuck their heads out of the window.
1:21:41|1:21:53|Protesters ran past the car holding flags, while [Wang Can] struggled to block between the police and the protesters. Some tourists ran and climbed up the ladder at the back of the bus to the roof, leaving together.
1:21:55|1:22:22|Reporters with cameras were on the scene recording everything. The bus pulled up next to [Wang Can]. [Wang Can] and everyone from the tour group got on the bus. The bus drove away from the crowded crowd. La Xing closed the bus door. Some foreign tourists climbed onto the roof of the bus.
1:22:22|1:22:24|Foreign tourists who didn't make it up followed the bus and ran.
1:22:27|1:22:34|In the evening, the news reported that today a few Chinese people led a group of foreign tourists safely through the protest demonstration site.
1:22:57|1:23:12|Wang Can came to Cheng Yumeng, who was drunk, and put his arm around her shoulder. Cheng Yumeng smiled shyly. Li Meiling sat on the side editing information.
1:23:34|1:23:44|After clinking glasses and finishing the drink, [Wang Can] left the group and approached [Cheng Yumeng], who was sitting alone at another table lost in thought. [Cheng Yumeng] noticed him, and [Wang Can] put down his glass and sat down.
1:24:27|1:24:30|[Cheng Yumeng] smiled helplessly.
1:24:35|1:24:51|At this moment, the older sisters came to their table and sat down, singing a song. Wang Can drank the glass of wine, and the two looked at the older sisters. Na Jie stared at Cheng Yumeng singing happily. Cheng Yumeng smiled, and Na Jie invited the men at the table to sing along.
1:25:3|1:25:11|When it was just getting light, the tour group, drunk and arm in arm, left the bar singing and making a commotion.
1:25:26|1:25:39|Houses sit by the side of Lake Feiwa, with snow-capped mountains behind them appearing magnificent and beautiful in the light of the rising sun. The lake reflects the beautiful mountains, creating a stunning picture of the lake and mountains.
1:25:46|1:26:11|The snow-capped mountains were shining golden in the sunlight, as the sun gradually rose from behind the mountains. [Wang Can], carrying a large bag on his back, ran to the outside of [Cheng Yumeng]'s room. [Cheng Yumeng] opened the door to look outside, and [Wang Can] took a few steps back.
1:26:23|1:26:38|[Cheng Yumeng] closed the door again. [Cheng Yumeng] sat wearily on the bed, staring at the door with a look of annoyance. He closed his eyes and lay down on the bed, but he got up to brush his teeth.
1:26:46|1:26:56|He put down his phone, opened the computer, and downloaded Xiaolin's manuscript. The cover of the manuscript is the largest stupa in Nepal, and the title is still "Shouting at the Center of the World, I Am So Happy".
1:27:0|1:27:15|Before long, two off-road vehicles were driving in the mountains, with one of them carrying equipment on the roof. The vehicles first traveled on the main road, then turned onto a small mountain path, climbing uphill. The journey was bumpy, passing through the woods, and finally arrived at a flat plateau at the mountaintop and stopped.
1:28:6|1:28:15|Cheng Yumeng was helpless, while Wang Can looked aggrieved. A foreigner placed their paragliding equipment next to Wang Can, who then sat down on it.
1:28:18|1:28:25|He looked up at [Cheng Yumeng] in confusion, then gradually became despondent, and [Cheng Yumeng] couldn't help but grit his teeth.
1:28:31|1:28:39|Wang Can grinned. He stood up, shouldered his gear, looked at [Cheng Yumeng], nodded, and [Cheng Yumeng] smiled and followed him.
1:28:45|1:29:8|Arriving at the mountaintop for paragliding, [Cheng Yumeng] cautiously stands at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the steep cliff bottom with fear on her face. The foreigner helps [Wang Can] unfold the paraglider and then shakes hands and walks away. [Cheng Yumeng] turns around and runs to his side.
1:29:9|1:29:33|[Wang Can] has already fastened the safety rope on his body. [Cheng Yumeng] turned around and took a few steps, looking into the distance and stretching his body. [Wang Can] equipped [Cheng Yumeng]'s back, fastening every safety rope connection. [Cheng Yumeng] held the safety rope in front of his hips and took a look.
1:30:3|1:30:11|He turned to look at [Wang Can] sitting on the railing next to him. [Wang Can] looked at him calmly.
1:30:21|1:30:26|[Cheng Yumeng] was still nervous, while [Wang Can] looked at the wind vane beside him without moving.
1:30:33|1:30:54|[Cheng Yumeng] stood there blankly, with many images flashing through her mind. The bustling and busy Shanghai, the office workers rushing for work, the sleepless nights in the tall buildings and streets. The dwindling balance in her bank card, the numbers jumping on the meter. Pages of the calendar flipping over, days passing by in repetition.
1:30:56|1:31:17|[Cheng Yumeng] gradually closed her eyes, the bustling and restless scenes of the big city contrasting sharply with the tranquility of the mountain top beside her. As the last page of the calendar fell, everything seemed to return to calm.
1:31:22|1:31:50|Surrounded by silence, time seemed to stand still. [Cheng Yumeng] slowly opened her eyes and quietly observed everything in front of her. She released her tightly gripped safety rope, and all fear had dissipated.
1:31:50|1:32:11|In the tranquil mountains, the small trees and wheat fields swayed gently. [Cheng Yumeng] looked up at the sky, and the camera slowly moved behind her, showing only her hair slowly being blown by the wind.
1:32:17|1:32:43|The ripples appeared on the lake, the wind vane began to sway, the wheat swayed with the wind, the wind horse rode with the wind, and the wind grew stronger. [Wang Can] looked at the wind vane, and [Li Meiling] also happily looked at the wind vane. There were traces of wind blowing everywhere, and eagles soared in the wind.
1:32:46|1:33:10|[Wang Can] and [Cheng Yumeng] ran forward with a tandem paraglider, the wind blowing the canopy open. They leaped into the air, with many paragliders soaring above them. Below their feet were snow-capped mountains, rivers, valleys, and farmland. The familiar scent of the homeland's forests lingered in the air.
1:33:27|1:33:38|At this moment, the scene shows people dancing around the bonfire, with happy children by their side, capturing the everyday life and innocent smiles of the locals in Nepal.
1:33:43|1:34:2|Buffaloes lie in groups across the small river, while elephants and hippos stay quietly. The most ordinary life of Nepalese residents is happiness.
1:34:10|1:34:16|The trip is over, [Cheng Yumeng] returns to her home country, dragging her luggage through the airport terminal.
1:34:17|1:34:32|[Cheng Yumeng] stopped, turned around, and [Wang Can] walked towards her from a distance. [Wang Can] shook the cloth bag in his hand and then threw it to [Cheng Yumeng]. She reached out and caught it, looking at the cloth bag with a puzzled expression before glancing back at [Wang Can].
1:34:33|1:34:59|[Wang Can] just waved his hand and turned away. [Cheng Yumeng] glanced at the bag, smiled, and then left as well. Back at the residential building, she carried her heavy luggage up flight after flight of stairs. In the hallway, a neighbor was cooking by the stove.
1:35:6|1:35:27|He opened the door, carried the luggage in, and after entering the room, he took out the key and closed the door. He placed the luggage on the bed, ready to unpack, and noticed the cloth bag given by [Wang Can]. He picked it up and looked at it curiously.
1:35:33|1:36:2|Later, he came to the balcony, stepping on a stool to hang something up, then walked back into the room and quietly looked up at the balcony. It turned out that what [Wang Can] gave him was a copper bell to guide the water buffalo home. Looking at this copper bell, [Cheng Yumeng] gradually smiled, as if this copper bell would guide him in the right direction and he would never get lost again.
1:36:12|1:36:22|In the Western Xia era, herds of water buffalo roamed the wild, lounged by the creek, and followed the sound of the bell towards home.
