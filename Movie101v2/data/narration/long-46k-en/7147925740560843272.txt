0:1:18|0:1:36|The woman lying on the ground slowly opened her eyes, but in her mind, scenes of falling into the water appeared hazily. She stared around with wide eyes, different fragments of memories constantly surfacing before her. The uncontrollable circuit lines made crackling sounds, and after a noisy commotion, a scream followed.
0:1:37|0:1:55|The woman's painful expression appears on the screen, and the blood on the ground evaporates quickly with the passage of time, gradually disappearing. At this moment, a man's figure appears in the woman's mind, but she can't see his face clearly, only seeing him lying motionless on the ground, his chest rising and falling continuously.
0:1:55|0:2:14|At this moment, a sound of footsteps could be heard in the distance. A bald man in a white coat cautiously walked towards the iron fence. With lightning and thunder outside, he shrunk his head, looked around, and quickly opened the door to enter. The woman was startled and sat up, continuously moving backwards. He bent down, looking at the woman, and approached step by step.
0:2:14|0:2:19|The woman stepped back and accidentally bumped into the man in a suit sitting behind her, [Li Zheng].
0:2:33|0:2:50|The man in suit [Li Zheng] looked around, his expression becoming anxious. He fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a seal. Suddenly, a pair of glasses was thrown not far away, and the sound of an argument came from the aisle.
0:2:53|0:3:12|The bald man pushed open the door, stuck his head out to check the situation, only to see a figure flying out directly from the corridor and crashing heavily on the ground. The old man on the ground propped up his upper body, angrily accusing, while the leather jacket man who chased out glanced at him, then turned to look at the two timid people by the door.
0:3:33|0:3:41|After the group quieted down, they heard a faint sound of pain coming from not far away. Everyone looked in the direction of the sound, but couldn't see anyone there.
0:3:52|0:4:11|The woman heard a sound, and everyone inside was so scared that they didn't move. Outside, the lightning kept flashing, making the pitch-black room alternately bright and dark. Except for the woman hiding in the corner, everyone else crouched down and slowly walked towards the direction where the sound was coming from. The man in the leather jacket was holding a fire extinguisher and walking at the front, with the rest of the people following behind.
0:4:11|0:4:28|The woman, without anyone noticing, followed behind them, slowly walking forward while leaning against the wall. The sound of the movie became clearer and clearer, and at the end of the corridor by the stairs, a woman with disheveled long hair was crawling upwards. Seeing this scene, everyone involuntarily took a few steps back.
0:4:32|0:4:49|The woman with long hair stood up, raised her hand to tidy her hair, and looked at them fearfully. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief when they heard her speak. The man in the leather jacket also put down the fire extinguisher. The woman with long hair lowered her head, and forcefully pulled up the bathrobe that had slipped off her shoulders. Then, everyone slowly walked down the stairs.
0:4:49|0:5:4|The man in the leather jacket walked behind, once again raising the fire extinguisher beside him. He walked while looking around the environment. The bald man supported his waist, leaned forward, trying hard to see things around him. In the flickering light, a heavy iron door appeared in front of everyone.
0:5:4|0:5:13|Everyone stood in place, looking at the iron gate that pierced the ceiling. At this moment, the man in the leather jacket dropped the fire extinguisher in his hand and ran over. The man in the suit, strong and fit, also followed suit.
0:5:14|0:5:31|The two of them tightly pulled the door handle and yanked it hard, while the bald man pounded the iron door with his fist. Hearing the shouts, the crowd turned to look, only to see the back of a host appearing upstairs. The people below all raised their heads, looking at this mysterious figure. The man in the leather jacket couldn't help but ask,
0:5:31|0:5:38|The man with a cane arrived at the corner of the stairs, he glanced at the people below without answering. The man in the leather jacket asked again,
0:5:45|0:6:5|Hearing this, the man in the leather jacket quickly ran up and stood in front of the man. After speaking, he pushed aside the man in front of him and ran up, eagerly trying to find a way out, but almost stepped into the void as a result.
0:6:12|0:6:33|The man in the leather jacket gradually calmed down and turned around, pointing behind him. At that moment, a bright light appeared from the camera on the wall. After the woman with long hair finished speaking, everyone looked around vigilantly.
0:6:49|0:7:1|Upon hearing the man's words, everyone fell silent. They stood together, looking at each other, unsure of what to do next. Suddenly, a crisp sound of a switch being flipped broke the silence.
0:7:1|0:7:10|The dark house suddenly lit up, everyone puzzled, looking up at the strange structure of the environment, then all looked at the woman standing in front of the switch.
0:7:11|0:7:28|Soon, everyone was quickly drawn to a brightly lit room. [Ma Rui], with his hands in his pockets, peeked through the door and accidentally stumbled as he stepped over the threshold. The old man behind him was startled by this action and stood still for a moment, only to see [Ma Rui] walk inside.
0:7:28|0:7:33|An Xi kept flipping through the things on the table, while others also walked in one after another, paying attention to everything around them.
0:7:34|0:7:57|The old man looked at the dusty book on the table in confusion, while the supervisor rushed to the TV on the other side. The long-haired woman who had just entered the room was attracted by the clothes in the wardrobe next to her. Just as she was about to take the clothes down, [Li Zheng] raised his hand to stop her. [Li Zheng] opened the clothes.
0:8:3|0:8:6|Everyone listened with fearful expressions.
0:8:11|0:8:24|The woman with long hair widened her eyes, looking around anxiously. A chill crept from the bottom of her heart, causing her to instinctively hold her thin bathrobe tightly. Seeing this, the man took off his own coat and walked over, covering her with it, step by step.
0:8:35|0:8:55|At this moment, the man in the frame is holding a camera, filming an accident. In the shot, firefighters and police officers are also busy. Soon after, the old man starts to speak. Then, [Xiao Nai'en] takes out a book and walks into the classroom.
0:8:58|0:9:11|The noise was incessant, [Xiao Nan] slammed the textbook hard, but the dust from the powder made her choke. After speaking, [Li Zheng] looked at the man in the suit behind him. At this moment, a group of reporters surrounded [Ma Rui].
0:9:23|0:9:39|The bald man continued, walking into the operating room. [Han Mushan] corrected him upon hearing this, as [Ma Rui] pointed to the long-haired woman standing beside him.
0:9:59|0:10:8|In this scene, a man is hugging [Lily] from behind by her slender waist, and they are hurriedly taking off their clothes and lying on the bed.
0:10:8|0:10:25|After Lily finished speaking, Xiao Nan let out a meaningful howl, and the others didn't say anything. They turned to look at the man in the leather jacket sitting on the stool. The man in the leather jacket, who hadn't reacted yet, lowered his head to look at the ground. Perhaps sensing the gaze above him, he raised his eyelids and glanced around, only to find everyone looking at him.
0:10:25|0:10:39|An Xi's face showed a somewhat reluctant expression. In the scene, Ma Rui, wearing a leather jacket, sat in the car and tapped on the steering wheel.
0:11:19|0:11:35|[Ma Rui] walked out of the courtroom with a smile, but the next moment he felt like he couldn't breathe. His face turned pale as he gasped for air, leaning against a nearby pillar. Meanwhile, [Lily], who had just finished the sauna, was drying her hair with a towel. [Li Zheng] quietly jumped out of the car with a camera in hand, ready to leave.
0:11:40|0:11:44|Students were making a lot of noise in the classroom, making [Xiao Nai'en] so angry that he slammed the blackboard.
0:11:48|0:11:59|[Han Mushan] had just finished speaking when the elevator started making unusual noises. Meanwhile, [Yang Meng], who was driving at the time, accidentally left his phone hanging in front of the passenger seat. He stared at the road ahead, leaning down to pick up the phone.
0:11:59|0:12:12|[Lily] put on a bathrobe and tried to go out, but found that she couldn't push the door open. She anxiously knocked on the glass door of the bathroom. Outside the courtroom, [Ma Rui] took out the potion to save himself, but eventually collapsed on the ground.
0:12:17|0:12:26|[Lee Zheng], discovered by the police, heard a shout from behind while escaping. He raised the camera again to capture the news in front of him, and the explosion happened in an instant.
0:12:28|0:12:46|The elevator in the hospital plummeted rapidly, [Han Mushan] let out a scream, while [Lily] in the bathroom couldn't hold on and slipped to the ground. At this moment, [Yang Meng], who had just picked up his phone, crashed into the car, and the glass of the windshield splintered all around. His head hit the deployed airbag hard.
0:12:46|0:12:50|After finishing her story, everyone looked silently at An Xi.
0:13:9|0:13:13|[Han Mushan] stepped forward to break up the fight, while [Lily] quietly walked to [An Xi]'s side to comfort him.
0:13:33|0:13:51|After bringing the sun out, everyone lifted the paint bucket and placed it against the wall. The men hoisted [Lily] onto the paint bucket, and soon she saw outside through the window. The [Lily] outside the window was lost in thought, while [An Xi] stood at the room's doorway watching them from afar.
0:13:51|0:14:12|Later, [Lily] got off the paint bucket, [Xiao Naie] asked anxiously. Upon hearing [Lily]'s words, the people around her were so scared that they took a step back, and [Lily], who couldn't help but shiver, walked forward silently. [Han Mushan] couldn't believe it and caught up to ask a question.
0:14:39|0:14:50|[Yang Meng] cursed, then turned and climbed onto the paint bucket. He firmly pressed down on the chair that was swaying at the top, digging hard at the window, trying to get a clear view of this ghostly place that trapped him.
0:14:50|0:15:8|At this moment, as the rain started to drizzle outside, the sign of the Green Mountain Mental Rehabilitation Center at the door appeared particularly clear. The scene was then enveloped by the deep sea, with [An Xi] slowly sinking to the bottom of the sea with eyes tightly closed, but a voice beside him was calling out to wake him up.
0:15:53|0:16:5|Yao Meng was speechless after being criticized. Han Mushan walked out with a dark expression, took off his white coat, and threw it aside. At that moment, a food box was put through the small window on the door, and then immediately closed.
0:16:11|0:16:30|Everyone vigorously pounded on the window and shouted for help, but outside was silent. At this moment, [Xiao Nai'en] picked up a lunchbox and turned around, with everyone around him gathering closely. No one spoke, silently watching this strange lunchbox. [Xiao Nai'en] looked up and gazed at [Li Zheng] standing not far away, confusion in his eyes.
0:16:30|0:16:38|Following that, everyone gathered in the room. Han Mushan set aside the medicine on top of the lunchbox, gently lifted the lid, revealing nothing but a very ordinary boxed meal.
0:17:9|0:17:16|[Xiao Nai'en] had just handed out the boxed lunch, but [Li Zheng] snatched it away from the middle and poured the food directly on the ground. This made [Yang Meng] so angry that he pushed the chair away and stood up.
0:17:25|0:17:34|Pushed hard by [Li Zheng], Liang Liang staggered back a few steps. Looking at the furious [Yang Meng], he walked forward with crutches in hand, staring into Yang Meng's eyes.
0:17:38|0:17:44|He then turned around and looked at the crowd behind him.
0:18:37|0:18:45|[Xiao Nai'en] then took a screw and drew a line on the wall.
0:19:19|0:19:24|[Han Mushan] had just finished speaking when suddenly music could be heard from outside, leaving everyone in the room looking bewildered.
0:19:32|0:19:40|[Li Zheng] took the lead and walked out, the other men followed behind. [Lily] also wanted to go out, but [An Xi] stood up to stop her. She comforted [An Xi] and then walked out.
0:20:22|0:20:27|[An Xi], who was hiding under the table, grabbed the connecting wire near her feet and pulled the phone towards her to answer it.
0:20:35|0:20:44|[An Xi] held the phone in her hand, but her body kept twitching. She was breathing heavily, her eyes fixed on the silent door outside, with her messy hair covering half of [An Xi]'s face.
0:20:44|0:20:53|The scene then cuts to [An Xi] being bound to a chair, with a machine operating beside her. She opens her mouth in a scream of terror, but no sound comes out.
0:20:53|0:21:2|At this moment, [Li Zheng] sitting in the electric chair gradually regained consciousness. He glanced at the doctor sitting in front of him, then lowered his head to look at his hands that were locked, and couldn't help but struggle.
0:21:20|0:21:24|The doctor frowned at him, and [Li Zheng] didn't know how to refute.
0:22:4|0:22:6|The scene returns to the game.
0:22:38|0:22:52|After speaking, [Yang Meng] smiled helplessly, and the doctor also smiled at him. Then, [Li Zheng] reached out his hand towards [Lily] beside him, and [Lily] held his hand, the two gazed affectionately at each other.
0:23:1|0:23:14|At this moment, the isolated [Han Mushan] and [Xiao Nai'en] stood still in a daze. [Li Zheng] cleared his throat, hands on hips, looking at them. [Han Mushan] had no choice but to slowly approach [Xiao Nai'en], raising his hand in confusion, then gently patting Xiao Nai'en's shoulder.
0:23:14|0:23:25|On the other side, although [Xiao Nai'en] looked pained, one hand was already placed on [Han Mushan]'s waist. [Li Zheng] lowered his head and said something, then the scene cut back to the treatment room.
0:23:47|0:23:50|Soon after, several of them struck poses representing the evolution of humans.
0:24:4|0:24:11|After Xiao Nan finished speaking, he slowly extended his middle finger. The doctor immediately pressed the defibrillator button, and the sound of the electric current crackled. The people in the chairs groaned in pain.
0:24:16|0:24:27|Accompanied by a burst of sweet and tough shouting from Yang Meng, the screen gradually shows An Xi's empty and lifeless eyes. He sits straight on the stairs, his eyelids trembling slightly, looking helplessly ahead.
0:24:27|0:24:45|At this moment, the shocked crowd returned to their original positions. The others sat listlessly, resting. [Ma Rui] bent over, coughing heavily. Then, [Han Mushan] walked towards [An Xi] and squatted in front of him, supporting himself on the stairs.
0:25:7|0:25:18|Everyone looked up in confusion after hearing that, [Ma Rui], who was sitting on the ground, stood up directly. [Li Zheng] asked. The pale-faced [An Xi] turned to look at everyone.
0:25:23|0:25:42|[An Xi] recalls the scene in the treatment room. Locked to a chair, [An Xi] looks at the doctor sitting across under the light, crying softly in fear. The doctor frowns, moving his legs back and forth continuously.
0:25:48|0:26:6|After speaking, the doctor unlocked the handcuffs restraining [An Xi]'s hands. She slowly lifted her head and picked up the medicine placed in the iron basin. After taking the medicine, upon hearing these words, [Yang Meng] also immediately stood up.
0:26:10|0:26:14|[Li Zheng] leaned on the railing with one hand and picked up the cane to stand up.
0:26:35|0:26:46|Bending down, [Ma Rui] stared at An Xi. [Li Zheng] gritted his teeth and forcefully slapped An Xi's shoulder.
0:27:44|0:28:4|After speaking, he looked at [An Xi], raised his hand and pointed to the iron railing at the end of the corridor. [An Xi], with tears in her eyes, supported herself on the stairs and stood up, looking at the furious [Li Zheng]. [Xiao Nai'en] stood aside with a troubled expression, while [Han Mushan] turned to look at the others. The dim light seeped through the cracks and cast a hint of sadness on the wall.
0:28:4|0:28:17|The dimly lit corridor still had lights on both sides. At this moment, [An Xi]'s bright and straight back appeared in the corridor, and he locked himself in the iron fence without looking back, everyone stood still silently watching him walk in.
0:28:18|0:28:34|Not long after, the sky suddenly thundered, and the mental hospital was once again shrouded in dark clouds. In the prison, [An Xi] squatted by the wall, constantly writing and drawing on it. Slowly, her crouching figure gradually stood up, but the stone in her hand accidentally fell.
0:28:34|0:28:40|She bent down to pick it up, then immediately started writing on the wall, making a sizzling sound with her mouth.
0:28:42|0:28:55|At this moment, the scene shows the back of [Xiao Nai'en], who is holding a nail and drawing another line on the cement wall. Sitting at the table, [Ma Rui] rests his elbows on the table and stares blankly, while [Yang Meng] puts his feet up on the table, looking at the drawing on his lap.
0:28:55|0:29:4|[Lily] tilted her head and stared blankly ahead, while [Han Mushan] sat on the other side with a furrowed brow. At that moment, [Yang Meng] threw the painting off his lap, and [Li Zheng] turned to look at him.
0:29:18|0:29:21|[Yang Meng] crossed his hands and stared at the ceiling without saying a word.
0:31:8|0:31:20|Seeing everyone starting to sing along, [Ma Rui] didn't say anything more. [Li Zheng] looked up, glanced at the camera, and then pointed. Everyone immediately understood his meaning, walked towards the area visible to the camera, and started singing loudly again.
0:31:21|0:31:54|Who is calling out for deep love, letting my desires drift like white clouds. Teacher Xiao, what are you doing? Old man, what song are you singing? Come on, let me keep the beat for you. Just that line, one two three. Who is calling out. Everyone obediently started singing, but [Li Zheng] walked over, knocked down a chair beside him, and the singing abruptly stopped.
0:32:19|0:32:26|The words were not finished yet, and the camera started to rotate. Everyone looked at the camera in unison.
0:32:34|0:32:50|Li Zheng sang while gesturing with his arms, urging everyone to sing louder. Then he picked up his cane and glanced at [Xiao Nai'en] standing in front. Reluctantly, [Xiao Nai'en] nodded heavily and moved his mouth along. The others sang as if they were going to shout their lungs out, looking at the camera and singing with all their might.
0:34:1|0:34:19|[Lily] sings an Indian song, with a few people following behind humming the melody. Everyone stands in front of the camera, with all of them standing behind [Lily], raising their hands to perform the Guanyin hand-holding gesture. Then, they start dancing in circles around the staircase, with the camera in the corner of the wall rotating along with their formation changes.
0:34:22|0:34:34|[An Xi], who was locked in prison, heard the commotion outside and turned to look at them. At that moment, [Lily] stood at the front of the line, twisting her body and waving her arms, while the men behind her clumsily danced, their movements looking quite comical.
0:34:42|0:34:59|After a few rounds of jumping, everyone's movements became more chaotic, but the camera still followed the formation as it spun. [Ma Rui] was exhausted and stopped, leaving the team. [Li Zheng] grabbed him, but [Ma Rui] shook off his hand, unwilling to say more, as [Li Zheng] turned to call out to the others.
0:35:4|0:35:9|Forget it, [Li Zheng] scratched his head and walked towards [Ma Rui].
0:35:40|0:35:47|At this moment, [Li Zheng] suddenly grabbed [Ma Rui]'s hand. Upon hearing the fight was about to break out, [Yang Meng] immediately stood up, while [Li Zheng] smiled and said.
0:36:7|0:36:24|[Ma Dongmei] approached with cautious steps, while [Xiao Nai'en] kept stepping back. [Xiao Nai'en] quickly waved his hand, and [Ma Dongmei] walked over and said.
0:36:35|0:36:38|At this moment, [Lily] rushed over and grabbed [Xiao Nai'en]'s hand, placing it on her chest.
0:36:57|0:37:12|[Han Mushan] pretended to lightly punch [Xiao Nai'en], who then mustered up the courage to push [Han Mushan] back. The two of them started playfully exchanging punches, while [Yang Meng] on the side couldn't bear to watch.
0:37:12|0:37:18|[Ma Rui], with his hands in his pockets, immediately reacted and strode over aggressively, rolling up his sleeves and forcefully pushing [Xiao Nai'en].
0:37:38|0:37:40|Hearing the noise, [An Xi] turned to look at them.
0:37:59|0:38:9|At this moment, a bright light suddenly appeared on the camera, but An Xi was looking at the crowd pretending to fight each other. Seeing everyone's poor acting, An Xi's eyes suddenly became fierce.
0:38:12|0:38:32|He walked over, angrily throwing away his cane. At this moment, the camera started operating again, with [Li Zheng] reaching through the railing to grab [Xiao Nai'en]. [Xiao Nai'en] struggled for breath, struggling hard.
0:38:34|0:38:46|Panicked, [Ma Rui] hurriedly supported [Xiao Nai'en]'s arm. Seeing [Xiao Nai'en] struggling, [Yang Meng] quickly jumped down from the paint bucket, while [Lily] beside him covered her mouth in shock.
0:38:46|0:39:1|[An Xi] saw this scene and immediately opened the gate to run out, controlling the three people around [Xiao Nai'en], all with a fierce look in their eyes. [Xiao Nai'en], who was being choked, widened his eyes, saliva uncontrollably spraying out, as [An Xi] ran over shouting. He immediately ran down the stairs and grabbed [Li Zheng].
0:39:4|0:39:18|[Yang Meng] also rushed over and pulled [Li Zheng] up with force. Ma Rui and [Han Mushan] were both scared and immediately stepped back when they saw it. [Li Zheng] lay on the ground looking puzzled.
0:39:26|0:39:37|Seeing [Yang Meng] angrily, [Li Zheng] stood up from the ground, and Xiao Nan, who survived the disaster, came to his senses and cried in fear. However, [Li Zheng] still looked puzzled.
0:39:37|0:39:52|At this moment, [Yang Meng] stared straight at [Li Zheng] as he walked over, looking him up and down before pointing a finger behind [Li Zheng]. Following his gesture, [Li Zheng] turned his head and saw the slightly eerie prison at the end of the corridor. [Li Zheng] then looked back at [Yang Meng].
0:40:6|0:40:18|Li Zheng stared at him defiantly, while Yao Meng also took a few steps back and stood beside the others. At this moment, everyone's gaze turned to Li Zheng, even the usually gentle An Xi was staring at him intently.
0:40:18|0:40:35|Seeing everyone's indifferent eyes, [Li Zheng] didn't say anything more. Soon, a new figure appeared in the prison. [Li Zheng] was leaning on a crutch, his upper body hunched over, his gaze fierce as he looked towards the other end of the corridor. Amidst the lightning and thunder, [Li Zheng] suddenly caught sight of the words on the wall.
0:40:35|0:40:58|He fixed his gaze and saw almost the entire wall covered with the words "only me". The next day, as usual, the hospital opened the window, placed a bowl of boxed meal inside, and quickly closed it. [Yang Meng] walked over, took the bowl of boxed meal, and the other men stood still watching him, only to see him happily walking away with the meal.
0:41:29|0:41:38|[Yang Meng] handed over the medicine, [Ma Rui] on the opposite side smiled kindly while shaking his head, afraid of angering [Yang Meng]. Then he looked at [Han Mushan], only to see the latter turn his head away, with a blue expression on his face.
0:41:51|0:42:2|In the middle of the conversation, he handed the lunchbox to [Xiao Nai'en], then picked up the medicine and headed straight to the prison. As he passed by the staircase, he stopped and glanced at [Lily] standing beside it.
0:42:5|0:42:17|[Yang Meng] smiled triumphantly, took the medicine and walked back to the prison. [An Xi] stood up anxiously, craning her neck to look. Everyone looked towards the direction of the prison in confusion. They saw [Yang Meng] open the door and walk in.
0:42:33|0:42:51|Others were so scared by the commotion that they dared not say a word. [Lily] carefully took off the coat that [Li Zheng] had given her. Before long, [Yang Meng] strode out aggressively with a cane in hand. He swaggered through the corridor and stood at the top of the stairs, leaving a pool of blood with his cane.
0:42:51|0:42:54|[Yang Meng] didn't care at all and threw the crutch aside.
0:42:55|0:43:10|[Ma Rui] saw him and smiled kindly, then [Yang Meng] turned to look at the stairs. [Lily] was lowering her head, tightly wrapped in a thin bathrobe. He immediately took off his coat and threw it to [Lily]. Looking at [Lily]'s pitiful eyes, the satisfaction in [Yang Meng]'s eyes became even more apparent.
0:43:10|0:43:15|In the afternoon, everyone found a piece of iron plate and placed it between the broken stairs. [Yang Meng] was the first to step on it.
0:43:17|0:43:31|Upon hearing Lily's concern, Yang Meng turned his head and smiled, then ran over with determination. The hopeful iron gate was within reach, and the others looked on with anticipation. Yang Meng slowly moved the door handle, and the iron gate made a unlocking sound.
0:43:31|0:43:39|He smiled and glanced at her, giving a gentle push, but the door didn't open. [Yang Meng]'s face suddenly changed, he pushed harder, but the door remained unmoved.
0:43:42|0:43:55|Emotionally out of control, [Yang Meng] kept kicking the iron door, and others dared not approach. It wasn't until [Yang Meng] gradually calmed down that [Ma Rui] dared to walk over and try. He moved the handle, then gently pulled it inward, and the iron door slowly opened.
0:43:57|0:44:12|[Yang Meng] tilted his head and looked through the crack in the door, with others also peeking out from behind. The closest to the door, [Ma Rui], squinted his eyes against the bright light outside. Then, [Yang Meng] was the first to step out of the door, his eyes wide open as he looked around at everything.
0:44:12|0:44:25|Following closely behind, [Ma Rui] glanced to both sides, then immediately leaned against the balcony and looked down. The raindrops the size of soybeans kept hitting his face as he did so. After the others looked around, the confusion on their faces turned into shock.
0:44:26|0:44:44|With the rotation of the camera, the shocking scenery gradually unfolds, leaving everyone in awe. The distant mountain peaks stretch endlessly, as if there is no end in sight. Mist surges from hidden valleys, drifting to the mountaintops, resembling a green hat. The mental hospital is surrounded on all sides, appearing even smaller.
0:44:44|0:44:46|At night, the sound of Lily could be heard coming from the bathroom.
0:44:52|0:45:1|Standing outside the door, [An Xi] had a cold expression, staring intently at the closed bathroom door. Her eyes gradually became desolate, and suddenly, she picked up a small bucket next to her and placed it under the faucet.
0:45:13|0:45:26|[An Xi] threw away the bucket and ran out, pushing open the door of the bathroom. [Yang Meng] was angrily tidying up his clothes when he saw the panicked figure of [An Xi], and everyone gathered around.
0:45:26|0:45:38|Everyone turned their heads at the sound, only to see [Yang Meng] walking out with [Lily], his arm around her shoulder, still carrying the bucket in his hand. Finally, he threw it on the ground with a flick of his hand.
0:45:53|0:46:8|Under the pressure from Yang, no one dared to stop him. He walked straight towards [An Xi] who was hiding behind a pillar. [An Xi] turned around and met his fierce gaze. Yang stared at [An Xi] without saying a word, and the tension reached its peak at that moment.
0:46:11|0:46:13|Yang Meng looked at [An Xi] and asked again.
0:46:50|0:47:1|After speaking, [Yang Meng] grabbed [Lily]'s hand and headed towards the second floor, but [Han Mushan] followed and called out to him. [Yang Meng] turned around and glared at him, so [Han Mushan] had to leave.
0:47:19|0:47:28|[Yang Meng] turned around in surprise, glanced at [Han Mushan], and then waved at him. As [Han Mushan] approached, he leaned down and whispered to him.
0:48:36|0:48:45|Yang Meng's smile disappeared instantly, and he tightly held Lily. Lily didn't answer, but laughed like a crazy infatuated person.
0:49:0|0:49:10|Enraged, [Yang Meng] turned around and gave [Han Mushan] a kick, causing him to step back and fall to the ground. [Yang Meng] walked over and stepped on his hand.
0:49:17|0:49:39|[Xiao Nai'en] couldn't stand it, grabbed [Yang Meng]'s hair from behind. Yang Meng grimaced in pain, but he turned around and grabbed Xiao Nai'en's hand, bending it backwards, causing Xiao Nai'en to scream in pain. Xiao Nai'en had a pained expression with his mouth open, and [An Xi] immediately grabbed Yang Meng's hand.
0:49:49|0:49:53|Upon hearing this, [Yang Meng] pushed [An Xi] away in one swift motion.
0:50:4|0:50:24|Yang Meng shouted desperately, tearing at his bathrobe with all his might. Suddenly, a chair came down on the back of his head. Soon, Yang Meng collapsed to the side, while [Li Zheng] limped up the stairs and then threw the broken chair aside. In the blink of an eye, Yang Meng was already lying in the prison cell.
0:50:24|0:50:31|[Ma Rui] quickly closed the iron gate and put a lock on it. Yang Meng, upon hearing the noise, groggily looked around.
0:50:35|0:50:39|The moment the lock was pressed, [Xiao Nai'en] immediately started lecturing.
0:51:3|0:51:17|Yang Meng, sitting on the ground, mustered up his strength and lunged forward. He grabbed onto the fence gate, glaring fiercely at Ma Rui standing on the other side. But a sudden dizziness caused him to involuntarily close his eyes. Han Mushan, standing not far away, ran over to urge him on before quickly walking away.
0:51:17|0:51:27|[Xiao Nai'en] also spat behind him, then quickly retreated. Seeing [Yang Meng] squinting in silence, [Ma Rui] tentatively leaned forward.
0:51:29|0:51:53|Enraged [Yang Meng] is lying on the fence, trying to grab [Ma Rui]. Seeing the crazed look of [Yang Meng], everyone quickly leaves. [Yang Meng] looks at their fearful expressions and starts laughing maniacally.
0:52:2|0:52:17|At this moment, [An Xi] is kneeling on the ground praying, while inside the prison, [Yang Meng] is angrily grabbing the iron bars and shaking them continuously, roaring in anger. The shadow of the fan on the wall is reflected on the floor, making [An Xi]'s frail figure appear even smaller.
0:52:17|0:52:22|A bolt of lightning struck, illuminating the prison and making the Jesus statue on the wall stand out even more.
0:53:46|0:54:3|Upon seeing [Xiao Nai'en] bowing and apologizing, [Li Zheng] stood up in a fluster. [Ma Rui] looked up at [Li Zheng] and gave a embarrassed smile. Standing across from him, [Li Zheng] looked at his outstretched hand, feeling a bit embarrassed.
0:54:9|0:54:25|After speaking, [Han Mushan] walked towards the wardrobe with a smile, and took out the hospital gown in front of everyone.
0:54:37|0:54:56|[Xiao Nai'en] removed the gauze on his head and threw it on the table. Suddenly, the glass door was pushed open. [Lily] turned around and saw the imposing [Yang Meng], immediately scared and ran to the other side. [Li Zheng] picked up his cane and stood up glaring at her. Beside him, [Xiao Nai'en] legs went weak and took a few steps back.
0:54:57|0:55:8|At this moment, [Yang Meng] unexpectedly bent down and bowed to everyone. The others looked at each other in confusion. Then he stood up straight and removed the neck protector.
0:55:25|0:55:42|He threw the broken lock heavily on the table, at this moment, the surveillance in the corner was silently watching everything. Soon, everyone put on the hospital gowns, posted the written big-character poster on the pillar, accompanied by a round of enthusiastic applause, "Happy Healing, Get Well Soon" appeared in front of them.
0:55:42|0:55:44|[Ma Rui] clapped his hands and exclaimed excitedly.
0:56:2|0:56:6|Seeing the change in the expressions of the people around him, [Yang Meng] immediately changed his tone.
0:56:39|0:56:46|With a bewildered look, [Li Zheng] ignored the expectant gazes of everyone and sighed, raising his hand towards the distance.
0:57:20|0:57:25|[Han Mushan] finished speaking, and the surveillance camera suddenly turned towards [Ma Rui], who quickly coughed a few times.
0:57:52|0:57:59|The window was suddenly closed, and everyone fell into silence. [Ma Rui] picked up the medicine.
0:58:45|0:58:47|While others were fighting over medication, [Li Zheng] started singing.
0:59:11|0:59:19|He slapped himself after each line he sang, surprising the people around him. But soon they began to imitate [Li Zheng], fiercely slapping their own faces.
0:59:37|0:59:40|Seeing everyone's crazy behavior, [An Xi] ran over.
0:59:52|1:0:5|[An Xi] screamed and held her head, with the image of her struggling in the water flashing through her mind. The people around saw [An Xi].
1:0:24|1:0:43|Seeing [An Xi] stomping her feet and crying, everyone stood still in shock, looking at her with strange eyes. She trembled, placed her hand on her chest, pointed, then bent down to pick up the medicine next to the pillar. After looking at everyone in front of her, she immediately poured all the medicine into her mouth.
1:0:46|1:0:54|An Xi then threw away the box of pills and started chewing the medication in her mouth, capturing everyone's attention.
1:0:54|1:1:7|At this moment, [An Xi] kept making choking sounds, tears streaking down her face, yet she still struggled to swallow the medicine. The others seemed frozen, silently watching everything [An Xi] was doing, while [Ma Rui] and [Xiao Nai'en] stood by with their mouths half open in shock.
1:1:9|1:1:25|The phone on the stairs suddenly rang, breaking the silence. The scene then cuts back to the treatment room. [The doctor] opens the blinds, and a beam of light instantly shines through the window, illuminating the room. [An Xi], with a pale face, is sitting in a chair with her head down.
1:1:38|1:1:45|My treatment plan. At this moment, the scene returns to the mental hospital, with [An Xi] answering the phone, while the others gather around her.
1:2:13|1:2:29|After the dean hung up the phone, everyone looked at each other in confusion. [An Xi] quietly put down the phone in her hand, tears welling up in her eyes once again, and the atmosphere fell into a stalemate. Soon, everyone gathered together to discuss. After a round of applause, [Ma Rui] spoke.
1:2:42|1:2:46|[Xiao Nai'en] and [Ma Rui] raised their hands, and [Han Mushan] also raised his hand.
1:3:5|1:3:10|[Lily] lowered her head and fell silent after hearing this, quietly taking a step to the side.
1:3:32|1:3:34|[An Xi] looked up and calmly stared at them.
1:4:41|1:4:50|[Li Zheng] suddenly bent over, clutching his stomach and laughing. [Ma Rui] standing on the stairs looked surprised. After being mocked, [Ma Rui]'s face gradually darkened.
1:5:32|1:5:44|After speaking, Ma Rui took a few quick steps and climbed up the stairs along the railing. In the treatment room, An Xi stared at the hospital director and tearfully questioned him.
1:5:53|1:6:7|[An Xi] clenched her fists, furrowed her brows, tears streaking down her face. At this moment, inside the mental hospital, [Ma Rui] and others were so scared that they ran down the stairs.
1:6:29|1:6:48|[Yang Meng] hadn't finished speaking when [Han Mushan] walked over and slapped him. On the side, [Xiao Nai'en] raised his arm to strike, but was stopped by [Li Zheng]. Enraged, [Yang Meng] lifted his leg to kick [Han Mushan]. [Ma Rui] rushed over to help, but was pushed away by him.
1:6:48|1:6:53|[Lily] protected [An Xi] behind her, rushed forward, and pulled [Ma Rui], who was about to hit someone, aside.
1:7:5|1:7:13|The dean's words kept echoing in An Xi's mind. Watching everyone fighting each other, An Xi wanted to step in, but was pushed to the ground from behind.
1:7:25|1:7:49|[An Xi] slowly got up from the ground, looked up at the dark clouds outside the skylight. After a flash of lightning and thunder, pouring rain came down, the cold rain hitting his face, mixing with tears. At this moment, the person next to him was still in a tangle, roaring angrily with a red face.
1:8:29|1:8:46|At this moment, a siren blares and the tightly closed inner door finally opens automatically. The dazzling beam of light unexpectedly squeezes into the long-unseen mental hospital, and the entangled group of people finally stops. They look at the open door with a hint of disbelief.
1:8:46|1:8:53|At this moment, [An Xi], kneeling on the ground with a weary face, finally showed a faint smile, while the others stared at the door for a long time before reacting.
1:9:6|1:9:14|Everyone rushed out in a panic, leaving only [An Xi] kneeling in place. At that moment, the figure of the dean appeared at the door.
1:9:25|1:9:41|With wet hair sticking to his face, [An Xi] smiled as if relieved. Then, his body slowly tilted to the right and fell still. After fainting, [An Xi] seemed as if his whole body was sinking into the deep sea, yet he didn't struggle, but instead slowly sank with gravity.
1:9:42|1:9:59|A beam of strong light pierced through the deep sea, casting a paler shadow on [An Xi]. Suddenly, the dim sea surface gradually became clear, and the figure of a man in a suit jacket appeared on the water. At this moment, [An Xi] took a deep breath and woke up, his eyes filled with fear and tears streaming down his cheeks.
1:10:0|1:10:15|He stared at the spinning fan on the wall, then looked around. [An Xi] lay on the ground for a while, and then footsteps from outside the prison could be heard. He struggled to get up from the ground, only to see [Han Mushan] in a white coat walking in.
1:10:15|1:10:19|He took a few steps back in fear, only to bump into [Ma Rui] crouching in the corner.
1:10:24|1:10:29|[An Xi] tried hard to stifle her sobbing, stood up and grabbed [Ma Rui]'s hand to comfort him.
1:10:35|1:10:46|The other person shook off [An Xi]'s hand and pointed at him. [An Xi] cried and tried to explain, when suddenly a pair of glasses flew out in the alley, and [Yang Meng] kicked [Xiao Nai'en] to the ground.
1:11:1|1:11:11|An Xi quickly ran over and pulled apart Yang Meng, who was about to hit someone. At the same time, Ma Rui and Han Mushan, who did not know each other, also ran out.
1:11:23|1:11:26|[An Xi] stepped forward again to stop him, but was pushed away by [Yang Meng].
1:11:59|1:12:9|The crowd turned to look. The dean stood on the second floor watching them.
1:12:27|1:12:37|[Li Zheng] then tried to bend his injured leg, [Yang Meng] raised his hand ready to grab the neck collar, [Ma Rui] took out the medicine for stopping laughter and checked it, [Xiao Nai'en] also took off the gauze on his head with a puzzled look.
1:12:58|1:13:2|Han Mushan stood still for a long time after hearing this, while the others looked at him one after another.
1:13:16|1:13:20|[Xiao Nai'en]'s memory of the classroom has now turned into an unfinished building.
1:13:42|1:13:49|[Ma Rui] recalled the scene in the courtroom but couldn't see the face of the person involved clearly. He tried to attract the other party by shouting, but the person gradually disappeared, which greatly shocked [Ma Rui].
1:14:36|1:14:43|You are always complaining about the congested road, [Yang Meng] closes his eyes and tries hard to recall, but the pain in his head makes him unable to help but squat on the ground.
1:15:51|1:15:59|In the scene, [An Xi] is looking in the mirror, but her clothes keep changing, from a leather jacket to a suit, and then from a bathrobe to a white coat.
1:16:15|1:16:29|After listening to these words, [An Xi] sitting in the therapy room lowered his head in pain. Suddenly, he picked up the steaming cup of water in his hand and placed it in the middle of the table. He then pointed directly at the director sitting opposite him with his index finger, slowly raised his head and said.
1:16:41|1:16:47|At this moment, [An Xi] had half of his face covered by his hair, with his hands crossed over his chest as he pondered.
1:17:5|1:17:17|[An Xi] tried to explain in a hurry, but suddenly couldn't catch her breath. She opened her mouth wide, struggling to breathe, and her eyes turned fierce. She stared at the dean.
1:17:28|1:17:42|After speaking, he turned his head with a resentful look, staring at the dean sitting across from him. He frowned at the dean, but soon nodded slightly in agreement, then raised his hand and pointed at him.
1:17:42|1:17:52|At this moment, [An Xi] had a look of anger on his face, tightly pursing his lips and raising his chin defiantly at the dean. However, soon his expression gradually turned despondent.
1:19:37|1:19:43|[An Xi] raised her hand and slammed it heavily on the table, lifting her head to look at the dean. She sniffed, then turned to the other side.
1:21:20|1:21:32|After speaking, [An Xi] in the treatment room grabbed her own neck and fell to the ground. Then, the [An Xi] in the bathtub submerged her whole body in the water. Suddenly, [Ma Rui] and others all looked at the scars on their wrists.
1:21:45|1:22:1|Unable to accept the reality, [An Xi] hurriedly fled. But as she ran towards the corridor near the prison, a sudden sound of objects falling could be heard. With tears in her eyes, she turned around to see the buildings behind her collapsing one by one, and the walls around her gradually peeling off, floating in the air.
1:22:1|1:22:5|[An Xi] looked at everything in front of her with fear, but could only watch them disappear helplessly.
1:22:8|1:22:26|At this moment, the ground near him also began to crack and split apart. [An Xi] hesitated and took a few steps back. Soon, the ground turned into pieces and slowly flew into the air. The surrounding walls also started to explode more violently. [An Xi] walked along the edge of the wall, slowly moving forward, while reaching out to touch the wall.
1:22:26|1:22:42|The wall cracked open as he touched it and walked forward. The surrounding wall fragments increased. He couldn't help but look back at the path he had walked. At this moment, the walls on both sides burst instantly, and large and small fragments gathered in the air.
1:22:42|1:22:58|At this moment, [An Xi] also felt a sharp pain in his head. He opened his mouth wide, raised one hand to hold his head, and the walls around him occasionally made exploding sounds. [An Xi] now had both hands covering his head, the recurring pain making her unable to stop her movements.
1:22:58|1:23:12|With the pain intensifying, [An Xi] couldn't help but start wailing uncontrollably. She held her head and slowly leaned back, only to find herself sitting on a hospital bed. Helpless, [An Xi] curled up her whole body, letting out agonizing screams.
1:23:12|1:23:18|The surrounding wall fragments gradually disappeared, and [An Xi], nestled in the arms, finally dared to slowly raise her head to observe carefully.
1:23:19|1:23:33|At this moment, he was in a tidy hospital room, with a dim light casting a faint glow in front of the bed. Sitting on the bed, [An Xi] hugged his legs, his body trembling uncontrollably, even his breathing becoming rapid.
1:23:33|1:23:50|He looked around and saw various pieces of furniture in the spacious ward. After a while, his emotions gradually calmed down. He opened his eyes wide to observe everything around him. There were cabinets at both ends of the hospital bed, each with a teapot on top, and a painting standing on the table.
1:23:50|1:23:52|Next to it are different colored dyes.
1:23:53|1:24:10|There are other paintings of various styles, scattered in the corner, and these paintings are exactly the same as those seen in the mental hospital at that time. The blackboard-style walls are filled with regular characters, just like the marks made by [Xiao Nai'en] on the wall every day. On the sofa opposite, there is a cute teddy bear doll placed.
1:24:11|1:24:25|Soon, [An Xi] noticed the camera installed in the corner of the wall. He covered it with his hand, quietly observing for a while before slowly lowering his head. Then, he turned to look above the head of the bed, only to see the words "only me" written all over the wall.
1:24:28|1:24:39|[An Xi] was startled by the sudden ringing of the phone, before he could react, the urgent ringing sounded again. He slowly approached the phone, preparing to answer.
1:24:39|1:24:50|The scene shifts, showing the Dean's back in the frame. He opens the blinds, looks back at [An Xi], then takes out a handgun and places it on the table. He then turns the gun handle towards [An Xi] and pushes it towards her.
1:24:50|1:25:10|After the conversation, [An Xi] went to the bathroom. He was seen leaning over the sink, continuously washing his face, then covering his face and starting to cry. After a while, he reached out to turn off the tap, trying to calm himself down. Then, he slowly lifted his head, staring at his disheveled self in the mirror.
1:25:22|1:25:33|[An Xi] recalled the words of the dean in his mind, looking at himself in the mirror with a hint of unfamiliarity. Then, he slowly stood up straight, and his eyes became firm.
1:25:43|1:25:53|The dean's words were vivid in his mind. After hesitating for a moment, [An Xi] lowered his head and picked up the handgun placed above the sink. He held it in his hand for a long time, unable to help but start crying again.
1:25:54|1:26:7|The presence of multiple personalities has made [An Xi] suffer greatly, but he has already regarded them as family. Now, summoning the courage to pick up this gun, [An Xi] is powerless to dilute the pain and conflict in his heart.
1:26:7|1:26:21|He had no choice but to bear the endless pressure, holding the gun in his hand as he walked out of the bathroom. Each step he took at this moment felt as heavy and sluggish as if he had a thousand pounds on his feet. And so, slowly, he walked out of the bathroom and into the corridor.
1:26:22|1:26:42|At this moment, [An Xi] had water droplets on her face, tears shimmering in her eyes. However, her gaze gradually became resolute as she walked towards the ward with quickened steps. When she was about to reach the ward, she suddenly stopped at the door, a fierce determination in her eyes. With a strong push, [An Xi] entered the room, her eyes wandering around.
1:26:42|1:26:45|At this moment, [Yang Meng] and others surrounded from behind.
1:27:31|1:27:44|[An Xi] picked up the gun, turned around and pointed it at them, the crowd gathered around instantly scattered. After firing a round, he pointed the gun at [Han Mushan] standing on the left. The other party was at a loss, waving his hands in panic, but [An Xi] still kept the gun pointed at him.
1:28:10|1:28:18|Han Mushan frowned and lowered his head after hearing it, not knowing what to say. An Xi, with tears in her eyes, moved the gun towards Xiao Nai'en standing aside.
1:28:49|1:28:55|[Xiao Naien] suddenly remembered the painting he had seen before, with the figures in the painting being himself and [An Xi].
1:29:24|1:29:29|[Ma Rui] felt extremely uncomfortable after hearing this, turned his head away, unwilling to look at [An Xi].
1:30:19|1:30:29|[Li Zheng] frowned, not daring to meet [An Xi]'s eyes. In the memory, [An Xi] was placing her hand on the bookshelf in a poised manner, while [Li Zheng] was taking pictures of her with a camera, both of them having a great time.
1:30:32|1:30:46|[An Xi] finished speaking, [Li Zheng] turned his head and looked at him with a heartache. At this moment, [An Xi] was already in tears, leaning on [Li Zheng]'s shoulder with a face full of grievances. [Li Zheng]'s mouth moved, but he couldn't say anything, so he sadly closed his eyes.
1:30:46|1:30:53|An Xi then let go of Li Zheng and walked towards Yang Meng, who had his back turned. He wiped away his tears and then pulled him over with one hand.
1:32:21|1:32:29|Lily lowered her head, trying hard to control her emotions. Li Zheng raised his head and closed his eyes, while Xiao Nai'en tightly pursed his lips.
1:32:40|1:32:56|The crowd was completely moved by the words of [An Xi], and [Ma Rui] couldn't help but cry along with him. But at this moment, a piercing sound rang in [An Xi]'s head, causing him to grimace in pain, clutching his head tightly. The pain intensified, and [An Xi] couldn't help but bend over to ease it, but at that moment,
1:32:56|1:32:59|A hand suddenly picked up the gun in [An Xi]'s hand.
1:33:6|1:33:11|The dean tightly held the hand of [An Xi] holding the gun, looking at the people standing opposite.
1:33:43|1:33:54|[An Xi] put down the gun, reluctant to look back. [Li Zheng] and [Yang Meng] stood still, silently watching her. Then, she tried to hold back her tears, raised the gun, and turned her head absentmindedly to look ahead.
1:34:1|1:34:18|He looked at the dean with tears in his eyes, then raised the gun to his own temple. As the gunshot rang out, the screen plunged into darkness. After a while, a bullet casing fell to An Xi's feet. Li Zheng raised An Xi's arm from behind and pointed the gun towards the ceiling.
1:34:19|1:34:33|With her head down and eyes tightly closed, [An Xi] slowly opens her eyes. [Li Zheng] slowly lowers his arm, and the now aware [An Xi] looks around to see everyone looking at him with concern. Then, he turns to look at [Li Zheng] standing behind him, revealing a happy smile.
1:34:34|1:34:50|Not long after, he fainted in [Li Zheng]'s arms. At that moment, [An Xi] felt as if she was in the quiet depths of the sea, with the sound of gentle waves in her ears and the continuous melody of the moon's whistle. Upon hearing it, [An Xi] immediately opened her eyes and looked around.
1:34:50|1:35:5|Surrounded by others in the mental hospital, [An Xi] lay on [Lily]'s lap with a peaceful expression, sleeping soundly. [Lily] gently stroked [An Xi]'s hair, while [Yang Meng] squatted opposite, humming a familiar tune. [Han Mushan] smiled as he looked at the sleeping [An Xi].
1:35:32|1:35:41|[Han Mushan] lowered his head silently behind the hall, [Xiao Nai'en] turned around, reluctant to look at the place where everyone had once been together, while [Yang Meng] picked up the handgun on the ground decisively.
1:36:10|1:36:19|Maybe when he gets old, he will have a house of his own on the beach.
1:36:33|1:36:48|After speaking, [Yang Meng] and [Li Zheng] both squatted beside [Lily], looking reluctantly at the peacefully sleeping [An Xi]. [Ma Rui] couldn't help but let out a sigh, then stubbornly turned his head to the other side. [Yang Meng] nodded with a smile, and [Lily] instantly understood his meaning, giving a playful smile.
1:36:48|1:36:59|Shortly after, everyone turned around and smiled at [Ma Rui] standing in the distance, only to see him sniff and turn his head to the other side. Then, he pretended to be indifferent and walked past [Li Zheng].
1:37:11|1:37:27|Ma Rui lowered his head and smiled quietly after hearing it. Yang Meng stood up from the ground and kept looking at the sleeping An Xi, unwilling to open his eyes. Then he looked at Xiao Nai'en standing beside him, nodded in agreement, and immediately everyone surrounded An Xi in the middle.
1:37:27|1:37:43|At this moment, [Yang Meng] once again played the familiar melody. [An Xi], lying on [Lily]'s lap, hugged himself with both hands. At this moment, he no longer frowned, but fell asleep with a faint smile. Accompanied by a loud gunshot, the melody on his lips also stopped.
1:37:43|1:37:50|At this moment, [An Xi], who is in the deep sea of consciousness, is awakened by the consecutive gunshots. She struggles incessantly but can't open her eyes.
1:37:50|1:38:2|Just as the final gunshot rang out, [An Xi] suddenly opened her eyes, then she raised her hand to slowly push aside the hair on her face, looking around cautiously. At this moment, she was already lying on a hospital bed.
1:38:3|1:38:19|Looking at the familiar surroundings, [An Xi] slowly sat up in bed, the environment around her was eerily quiet. She turned slowly and looked behind her, at that moment, the sunlight outside the window illuminated the entire ward. [An Xi], who was unsure of what was happening, felt a bit at a loss.
1:38:19|1:38:26|She blinked and turned her head, showing no emotion on her face. At that moment, [An Xi] was captivated by a painting across the room.
1:38:27|1:38:40|The seven people in the conversation were all smiling happily, chatting and laughing on the bus. Sitting on the hospital bed, [An Xi] looked at this scene, tears welling up in her eyes. Afterwards, she packed her bags and stood in front of the gate of the psychiatric hospital.
1:38:44|1:39:1|The sturdy iron gate opened for [An Xi] at this moment. He had changed into clean clothes and walked out of the gate. The sky was filled with snowflakes floating freely like goose feathers. He stood alone in the snow, looking particularly small. The mental hospital behind him had also been transformed by the camouflage, giving it a touch of coldness.
1:39:1|1:39:18|Soon, the gates of the mental hospital slowly closed, and [An Xi] with a scarf around her neck looked up at the snowflakes dancing in the air. She tried to tilt her face up, feeling the snowflakes gently melting on her cheeks, and carefully experiencing the coldness of the strands of cold wind penetrating her body through the gaps in her clothes.
1:39:18|1:39:33|At this moment, [An Xi] had no joy on her face, instead, she looked sad. Not long after, she walked alone by the road with a suitcase in hand. By now, the snow on the road had already melted, while the small trees beside it were still covered in white snow.
1:39:33|1:39:44|[An Xi] approached closer, her eyes shining as bright as snow. Suddenly, a bus appeared behind her. She stopped and turned around to see [Lily] waving at her.
1:40:49|1:40:55|The film ends here, thank you for listening. Stay tuned for a post-credits scene.
1:42:41|1:42:57|The sudden voice in her mind made [An Xi]'s smile disappear instantly, but at this moment, [An Xi] seemed to once again fall into a deep sea. However, she was unwilling to sink again, instead she followed the shining sunlight and swam upstream, the dazzling light almost within reach.
1:42:57|1:43:7|[An Xi] struggled to kick her legs, trying to reach the bright shore quickly. But just as she was about to emerge from the water, everything around her was enveloped in a beam of light.
1:43:7|1:43:24|[An Xi] was seen lying in the bathtub, slowly opening her eyes. In a daze, she saw a figure in a suit appearing near the bathtub. Startled, [An Xi] sat up from the bathtub. The dean in a suit stood with his hands in his pockets, took a glance at her struggling to breathe at the moment, and then slowly sat down beside the bathtub.
1:43:24|1:43:33|[An Xi] with wet hair hanging down, looked up at him, her eyes filled with fear and helplessness.
1:45:0|1:45:7|In the turbulent world, disappearing without a trace, moving into the darkness.
