0:3:12|0:3:25|[Hu Bayi] threw stones into the tomb, triggering the mechanism. Burning arrows shot up like sparks from the ground, and the three of them dodged the arrows with their entrenching tools.
0:3:43|0:4:12|[Shirley Yang] is hanging above the suspended coffin, preparing to install the hook for the coffin. [Wang Kaixuan] is manipulating the tombstone statues on the side, accidentally triggering a mechanism. Suddenly, the suspended coffin shoots out large crossbow arrows in all directions. Seeing the danger, [Wang Kaixuan] inadvertently breaks the rope in his hand, causing [Shirley Yang] to fall onto the suspended coffin.
0:4:12|0:4:17|On the other hand, [Wang Kaixuan] lost his balance while dodging arrows and was about to fall into the tomb.
0:4:17|0:4:46|[Hu Bayi] saw the situation was critical, he quickly threw out the Flying Tiger Claw. The three claws of the Flying Tiger Claw opened and got stuck in the gap of the railing, catching [Wang Kaixuan] who was falling. [Hu Bayi] quickly stabilized his stance, one hand hanging low at the abdomen, the other hand raised high over the shoulder, as if catching an eagle, firmly holding [Wang Kaixuan]. The crisis was averted, and the three continued to open the coffin. [Hu Bayi] and [Wang Kaixuan] held the rope at both ends.
0:4:46|0:5:9|The two of them struggled to pull up the rope, only to hear the bell on the coffin suddenly ringing. A strange dark purple flame burst out from the hanging coffin, and when the eerie flame dispersed, the female corpse inside the coffin was unexpectedly covered with a red veil. [Hu Bayi] climbed onto the coffin, and through the red veil, he discovered that the female corpse had skin like jade, seemingly not a dead person, suddenly.
0:5:9|0:5:18|In the tomb chamber, a chilling wind blows, causing the candlelight to change from red to green.
0:5:28|0:6:0|With a heavy heart, [Hu Bayi] sighed inwardly. He reached out and lifted the red veil from the woman's body, only to see the corpse suddenly open its eyes as if trying to steal [Hu Bayi]'s soul. At that moment, the coffin creaked and cracked open, sending wood chips flying as both he and the woman were thrown into the air. Unexpectedly, the two seemed like old friends reuniting, reaching out their arms trying to touch each other, yet just a fingertip away.
0:6:0|0:6:8|[Hu Bayi] was unable to save the female corpse and could only watch as it fell, causing the surrounding graveyard to collapse.
0:6:10|0:6:26|The dream is here, waking up Hu Bayi leaning against the door frame. He is pale, breathing heavily. The trio of tomb raiders has already moved to New York, with Wang Kaixuan selling antiques on the street.
0:6:30|0:6:52|[Wang Kaixuan] enthusiastically shouted at the foreigners, his face full of disdain, then he patted his chest.
0:7:24|0:7:50|[Wang Kaixuan] pretended that someone was behind him, causing the foreigner to turn around. [Wang Kaixuan] accidentally bumped into piles of cardboard boxes.
0:7:51|0:8:13|[Hu Bayi] had just pulled [Wang Kaixuan] up and was about to continue running when [Shirley Yang] drove up and stopped in front of them. She pointed at [Hu Bayi], prompting [Wang Kaixuan] to stick his head out. Seeing Detective Du Han and his men approaching, [Hu Bayi] quickly opened the car door and got into [Shirley Yang]'s car, only to hear a loud roar.
0:8:13|0:8:31|[Shirley Yang] stepped on the gas pedal, turned the steering wheel with both hands, and shook off the pursuit of the immigration officers. Looking down, the Leisler Building sparkled in the sun. Suddenly, a cloud of sand and dust rose in the city. When the golden sand settled, the three words "Seeking the Dragon" appeared in the air.
0:8:33|0:9:19|[Shirley Yang] drove the two to under the bridge. Upon hearing this, [Hu Bayi] remained unusually indifferent. [Shirley Yang] spoke with hesitation.
0:10:6|0:10:14|[Hu Bayi] looked angry, then opened the car door and walked away in a huff, before standing alone by the river in a daze.
0:10:49|0:11:16|[Shirley Yang] listened to [Wang Kaixuan], but her attention was focused on [Hu Bayi]. [Wang Kaixuan] grabbed the touch gold talisman on [Hu Bayi]'s chest, feeling very resentful in his heart. He quickly walked up to [Hu Bayi].
0:11:17|0:11:42|Unexpectedly, when [Hu Bayi] heard this, without even looking, he grabbed the ghost-catching talisman, wrapped the rope around it, and swiftly walked to the riverbank. Without any hesitation, he threw the talisman into the river, leaving [Wang Kaixuan] stunned by his actions.
0:11:42|0:11:57|[Hu Bayi] just nodded and chose to leave. As night fell in New York, the city lights came on, illuminating the entire city. [Da Jinya] didn't hesitate to show off his shiny gold tooth.
0:12:28|0:12:42|With great effort, the translation continued, when suddenly there was a loud bang, and [Wang Kaixuan] pushed the door open.
0:15:3|0:15:30|The next day, the reflection of trees and houses was cast on the window of [Hu Bayi] by the sunlight. Anxious [Shirley Yang] came to his house looking for him. [Shirley Yang] searched the first floor but couldn't find him, so she quickly climbed the stairs to the second floor, only to see [Hu Bayi] sleeping in the tent.
0:15:48|0:16:27|[Hu Bayi] couldn't help but stop in his tracks. Upon hearing this, [Shirley Yang] quickly walked towards [Hu Bayi]. [Hu Bayi] continued to act dumb and walked down the stairs. As soon as [Shirley Yang] finished speaking, she threw the document bag in her hand to [Hu Bayi]. He took the bag, opened it, and found a videotape inside.
0:16:28|0:16:35|Shirley Yang just responded with a contemptuous smile.
0:17:12|0:17:34|[Shirley Yang] was curious when she first heard about [Ding Sitian], so she sat down next to [Hu Bayi]. With that, [Hu Bayi] began to tell [Shirley Yang] the story of [Ding Sitian] from years ago.
0:18:28|0:19:7|The sun gradually dissipated, and the grassland was about to welcome the night. The pickup truck was driving on a bumpy road, and the young people in the car were unusually restless. The driver quickly got out of the car to check the situation, leaving the young people puzzled for a moment.
0:19:58|0:20:19|The young people looked puzzled, [Hu Bayi] took out a compass for exploration, and the compass needle spun wildly.
0:21:18|0:21:24|With the collapse of the stone statue, the young intellectuals were filled with momentum and continued to conquer other stone statues.
0:21:27|0:22:8|Hu Bayi quickly bent down and pressed his ear to the ground. The buzzing sound kept coming from the depths of the earth. After the stone statue was pushed over, a towering black pillar instantly surged up from the remaining hole in the ground. The black pillar scattered and spread out, resembling a city shrouded in black clouds.
0:22:8|0:22:45|A young intellectual waved a shovel to drive away grasshoppers, but was still covered by them. When the grasshoppers dispersed, the young intellectual had become a dried corpse. The grasshoppers seemed to have not tasted human blood for many years, but now they were extremely ferocious after their first taste. Each young intellectual killed by the grasshoppers looked like a terrifying dried corpse. The pursuit of the grasshoppers continues, and [Wang Kaixuan] accidentally falls while trying to avoid them, but in doing so, he discovers a refuge.
0:22:45|0:23:16|Ding Sitian accidentally sprained his ankle and fell down. Seeing the grasshoppers approaching, [Hu Bayi] quickly carried the injured Ding Sitian to find shelter. [Hu Bayi] hurriedly used a piece of wood to block the door, while the young people took out their clothes to seal the gaps in the door. The sound of impact was incessant, but the grasshoppers ultimately returned without success.
0:23:17|0:23:50|When the grasshoppers dispersed, the educated youth in the shelter lit torches. Just as everyone was immersed in sorrow, a loud noise suddenly startled them.
0:23:53|0:24:0|[Hu Bayi] quickly got up to comfort everyone.
0:24:2|0:24:42|[Hu Bayi] opened the door in [Wang Kaixuan]'s mouth. [Wang Kaixuan] held a torch but almost tripped. He walked up the iron ladder, stepping around with his feet. Little Ding led the female educated youth down the stairs, but the stairs were so old that they collapsed upon touch, falling heavily into the depths. The torch illuminated [Hu Bayi]'s profile as he pushed open another iron door.
0:24:43|0:25:10|But still couldn't find a way out. The educated youth were holding torches and searching everywhere for an exit, while Ding Sitian followed closely behind [Hu Bayi].
0:25:45|0:26:9|[Hu Bayi] extended the torch downwards and unexpectedly found an explosive package. He quickly moved the torch away. Meanwhile, [Wang Kaixuan] continued to hold the torch and led everyone through the underground works, searching for a way out. He led the way through a passage with exposed steel bars, with the others following behind, feeling somewhat scared. [Wang Kaixuan] looked up and spotted a scrapped mechanical device.
0:26:50|0:27:45|[Wang Kaixuan] exerted all his strength to turn the generator. As soon as the generator started successfully, he closed the circuit breaker, and the light bulb switched from dim to bright, indicating the arrival of electricity. However, a female educated youth was frightened by a skeleton at her feet. [Hu Bayi] saw the dried corpse on the ground and couldn't help but look around at the situation in the underground construction. Hearing this,
0:27:45|0:28:19|[Hu Bayi] looked into the distance and seemed to have discovered something. He raised his hand and pointed towards the distance, where the female educated youth stood on the high platform.
0:28:19|0:29:0|[Wang Kaixuan], [Hu Bayi], and [Ding Sitian] were exploring the underground construction site. [Hu Bayi] casually took out a knife, wiped it clean, and handed it to Ding. Seeing this, [Wang Kaixuan] picked up a shovel, determined to protect Ding.
0:29:38|0:29:55|[Hu Bayi] chased after the educated youth, who were completely ignoring him and just shouting slogans as they rushed deeper. When [Hu Bayi] caught up with them, he was stunned by the scene in front of him.
0:29:57|0:30:23|Suddenly, a purple light descended from above, and purple mist rose from the ground. [Hu Bayi] and the others couldn't bear the strong light and immediately raised their hands to shield their eyes. As the purple light gradually dissipated, large chunks of dust and debris floated down from the sky. [Hu Bayi] and the others lowered their arms and struggled to open their eyes.
0:30:23|0:30:37|As soon as the words fell, the male educated youth, Hu Bayi, suppressed his fear, holding a Type 38 rifle and firing two shots, but the zombie was already dead, and the bullets couldn't harm it in the slightest.
0:30:37|0:31:0|With a slash of the samurai sword, [Hu Bayi]'s arm fell off, and the surrounding dried corpses were stimulated by the blood, their originally sunken eyes flashing with blood. The tragic scene continued as the young intellectuals picked up various weapons and fought desperately against the attacking dried corpses. Seeing the situation turning dire, they fought their way out of the encirclement of the dried corpses.
0:31:1|0:31:27|[Hu Bayi] and [Wang Kaixuan] were eager to pull Ding Sitian away. Meanwhile, the mummy seized the opportunity to raise the samurai sword high and strike down. Seeing this, [Hu Bayi] seized the mummy's weapon, only to have it turn into ashes in an instant when he swung it towards the mummy. [Hu Bayi] stood still in shock, while the mummy engaged in a struggle with him. Ding Sitian tried to rescue [Hu Bayi], but was instantly grabbed by the mummy by the collar.
0:31:27|0:31:57|[Hu Bayi] broke free from the dried corpse, leaped forward, kicked the dried corpse away, and then pounced towards [Wang Kaixuan]. [Wang Kaixuan], unable to dodge in time, was knocked down by the dried corpse. Ding Sitian tried to pull [Wang Kaixuan] away, but was unexpectedly pinned down by the dried corpse on top of the underground explosive device. With a deafening roar, a huge explosion erupted, accompanied by endless flames and billowing smoke.
0:31:57|0:32:14|Countless dried corpses were instantly engulfed by flames. [Hu Bayi] quickly cleared a path, leading [Wang Kaixuan] and Ding Sitian to escape. Explosions were happening everywhere, and the passageway had already been taken over by flames and dust.
0:32:21|0:32:37|[Hu Bayi] and [Wang Kaixuan] escaped from the underground tunnel and sat on the grass, watching the raging fire burning for a long time without dispersing.
0:32:37|0:33:9|Looking out, the two of them saw the rising sun between the clouds in the distance, dyeing the sky red, a spectacular scene. [Hu Bayi] was lost in his own thoughts about what happened 20 years ago, pouring himself a glass of wine and offering it to the ancestral portrait on the altar. After toasting to the ancestral portrait, [Hu Bayi] stood there, lost in contemplation.
0:33:10|0:33:53|[Shirley Yang] looked at [Hu Bayi] for a long time, while [Hu Bayi] stood still, trying hard to recall his own firsthand experience 20 years ago. As he spoke, he walked to the window.
0:34:12|0:34:47|[Hu Bayi] sneered, his expression full of disdain for [Shirley Yang]'s words. He turned his head to look at [Shirley Yang], who immediately saw through [Hu Bayi]'s hidden agenda.
0:34:48|0:35:28|[Hu Bayi] gave a guilty response to [Shirley Yang], who gritted her teeth with anger. Without looking back, [Hu Bayi] left, and the closing door seemed to signal [Shirley Yang]'s complete departure.
0:35:28|0:35:56|Sitian's words fell, [Shirley Yang] stood still and gazed at [Hu Bayi], saying little before moving on to the lush greenery. [Wang Kaixuan] couldn't help but recite a poem.
0:39:45|0:40:3|[Wang Kaixuan] saw the same scene as 20 years ago, recalling the moment when he saw the sunrise, while he was sitting on the ground crying uncontrollably.
0:40:4|0:40:43|[Wang Kaixuan] turned around and looked back. The distant mountain peaks still resembled the image in his memory. At this moment, a dilapidated open-top jeep was driving on the rugged grassland road, with melodious Mongolian folk songs playing from the car.
0:43:28|0:43:39|At this moment, the sound of the grassland folk song caught the attention of [Shirley Yang], but what caught [Shirley Yang]'s attention was a motorcycle next to the small wooden horse.
0:43:39|0:43:55|[Shirley Yang] couldn't help but feel anxious, quickly walking towards Aji, squatting in front of him, taking out a toy from her pocket and placing it in front of Aji. At this moment, with the sun setting in the west, [Hu Bayi] rode a horse galloping across the grassland.
0:43:55|0:44:10|As the sound of the horn approached, [Shirley Yang] rode a motorcycle closely chasing after [Hu Bayi]. When he turned his head, he was suddenly surprised to see [Shirley Yang], who was driving the motorcycle carelessly, even waving her hand provocatively at him.
0:44:52|0:45:31|[Wang Kaixuan] patrolled around the giant pit where the workers were working, holding a rope and slowly lowering a birdcage into the deep pit, trying to determine if the air underground was normal. Unaware that [Mark]'s men were retrieving the signal receiver, [Wang Kaixuan] heard this and couldn't help but look up at [Mark].
0:46:6|0:46:34|A loud noise struck, followed by the sound of stones rubbing against each other. The stone door opened with a creak, revealing a deep corridor behind it. The light shone into the corridor, but couldn't illuminate the darkness inside. At this moment, [Hu Bayi] led two subordinates towards the stone door. However, all they heard from inside the door was the howling wind, and when the flashlight shone in, they only saw a swirling mist in the darkness.
0:46:35|0:47:6|It seems like a monster is rushing towards [Hu Bayi], instantly surrounding [Hu Bayi] and the other two. Unable to bear the fear, [Hu Bayi] and the others hurriedly retreat, waving their scabbard sticks in the air.
0:47:22|0:48:0|[Da Jinya] looked at the exquisite murals in the corridor and felt that his life was more important. He quickly picked up the helmet and skillfully put it on his head, then followed [Wang Kaixuan] through the dim corridor into a spacious stone cave.
0:48:0|0:48:30|[Wang Kaixuan] was extremely disgusted by the skeleton riding a horse in [Da Jinya]'s mouth. Feeling like he was in his own territory, [Wang Kaixuan] took [Da Jinya] to a crevice to investigate. As he squeezed into the crevice, he found the top covered with cloth strips.
0:48:30|0:49:3|Below the cloth strip is tied with a bell, [Wang Kaixuan] and [Da Jinya] walked past the cloth strip, while [Ying Caihong] was curious about the skeleton standing in the grotto, so she carefully approached to take a closer look. [Ma Dongmei] climbed onto the platform, climbed onto the horse, reached out to the skeleton's abdomen, and took the copper plate from the skeleton's abdomen.
0:49:3|0:49:25|Gently wiping off the dust on the copper plate, feeling quite pleased with himself, Hu Bayi then dismounted and wrapped the copper plate in white cloth. He handed the copper plate to Ying Caihong with almost flattering manner. Ying Caihong took the white cloth and the copper plate, holding it in her hands and carefully examining the mystery of the copper plate. A sudden noise interrupted Ying Caihong's contemplation.
0:49:27|0:49:51|The stone base under the skeleton slowly rose, and the subordinates quickly protected [Ying Caihong] away from the base. Suddenly, the strange noises became more intense. [Ying Caihong] followed the sound and saw many sealed stone doors slowly opening in the stone cave. Suddenly, strong winds blew out from the opened stone doors. [Ma Dongmei] quickly raised his arms, trying to block the dust blowing towards him.
0:49:51|0:50:4|The skull has turned into ashes, penetrating everywhere. [Da Jinya] and [Wang Kaixuan] are completely unaware of what's happening outside, still searching in the stone crevices.
0:50:4|0:50:30|At this moment, [Hu Bayi], [Hu Bayi] advised the other two not to worry about the flying ashes at all. However, the two of them coughed more and more violently, pounding their chests and stamping their feet. [Hu Bayi] seemed to feel something as well, as he stood still and started coughing violently, his throat moving up and down as if trying to cough out his internal organs.
0:50:30|0:50:39|The bizarre actions of Mark and the others caused astonishment among [Ying Caihong] and the rest, who were eager to investigate their situation. The three of them continued to cough persistently.
0:50:39|0:51:15|Mark, seemingly unwilling, quickly tore open his sleeve, only to find the same dark veins appearing on his arm. [Ying Caihong] and the others were shocked by the scene before them, stopping to watch. Mark couldn't hide his fear and screamed out.
0:51:15|0:51:48|Yangzi waved the dagger in her hand, trying to kill Mark and the other two. Wang Kaixuan went back to the cave to explore. Before Wang Kaixuan could finish speaking, Mark, who had just been killed by Yangzi, stood up from the ground.
0:51:49|0:52:3|Witnessing Mark standing up again, his colleague on the ground let out a piercing scream, only to see dark blue veins spreading across his palm like Mark's in an instant.
0:52:3|0:52:29|Yangzi quickly cut off the poisoned man's arm. Wang Kaixuan and Da Jinya, in a panic, found a crevice and squeezed into it. Inside the cave, Mark's attacks continued relentlessly. Despite everyone wielding batons to surround and attack Mark, it was to no avail. Instead, Mark, with his strange strength, easily knocked them to the ground.
0:52:30|0:53:6|At this moment, while [Wang Kaixuan] and [Da Jinya] were busy walking with their heads down, they unexpectedly ran to the edge of a crack in the ground. When [Wang Kaixuan] and the others stopped, with a command from [Wang Kaixuan], [Da Jinya] couldn't hide his fear and immediately ran off, wishing he had more pairs of legs. As soon as [Da Jinya] was the first to rush out of the crack, [Wang Kaixuan], who followed closely behind, quickly pulled out the black donkey hooves and started dancing with them.
0:53:6|0:53:37|[Wang Kaixuan] finished reciting the spell, then directly stuffed the black donkey hoof into Mark's mouth. Mark instantly stood still, not moving at all, his neighing becoming more piercing. He then took out the black donkey hoof from his mouth.
0:53:37|0:54:16|The two clenched their teeth and pushed forward, knocking Mark to the ground. Suddenly, a monster rushed out and pushed [Wang Kaixuan] down. [Wang Kaixuan] used a military shovel to wrestle with the monster on the ground. Suddenly, a flying tiger claw flew from a distance and hooked onto the monster's clothes. Upon hearing [Wang Kaixuan] give the secret signal, [Hu Bayi] couldn't help but smile knowingly, but [Wang Kaixuan] was not pleased.
0:54:17|0:54:49|[Shirley Yang] speaks up for [Hu Bayi], who leaps across a deep crevice to knock down the monster. Meanwhile, [Wang Kaixuan] struggles in a fierce battle with Mark. The three, [Hu Bayi], [Shirley Yang], and [Da Jinya], fight the monster with all their might and manage to escape, but unfortunately, one of [Ying Caihong]'s men accidentally detonates a bomb on himself.
0:55:25|0:56:1|[Shirley Yang] and [Wang Kaixuan] wield their weapons, buying time for [Hu Bayi], while [Da Jinya] quickly legs it away.
0:56:1|0:56:35|Shirley Yang inadvertently got entangled by the surrounding monsters. At this moment, she passed by Ying Caihong, her eyes coldly staring at her. Hu Bayi led the remaining people in the stone cave to rush into the stone gate of the virtual dog. When everyone ran out of the passage and arrived on the stone platform, they found themselves in a desperate situation.
0:59:33|0:59:59|With a gunshot, [Da Jinya] stood frozen on the spot, looking incredulously at his feet. [Ying Caihong] smiled knowingly upon hearing it, on the wooden plank path along the cliff.
0:59:59|1:0:14|[Hu Bayi] led the way with a flashlight, while [Wang Kaixuan] carried [Da Jinya] who was shot in the leg. The three of them walked on the narrow plank path, and [Da Jinya] accidentally bumped his head.
1:0:22|1:0:55|[Hu Bayi] reached into his shoe and slowly pulled out a rope, with a piece of gold-touching talisman tied to the other end. [Wang Kaixuan] exclaimed when he saw it.
1:0:55|1:1:34|In this place, there is a huge underground space, but it is in ruins with broken tiles and collapsed walls. A bridge made of iron cables and wooden planks is guarded by two eerie stone pillars. Upon arriving here, everyone began to survey the surroundings.
1:1:34|1:1:42|[Shirley Yang] cautiously stepped onto the iron cable bridge with a flashlight in hand, slowly lowered her body, and extended a foot to test the safety of the bridge.
1:1:43|1:1:59|[Hu Bayi] saw that she was about to take a risk, so he quickly reached out to stop her, but ended up walking alone on the long-neglected iron cable bridge.
1:2:3|1:2:10|The group followed in the footsteps of [Hu Bayi] across the iron chain bridge, only to be greeted by a vast underground cavern.
1:2:30|1:2:58|Among the countless dark green stone pillars standing upright in the water, connected by iron rope bridges, at this moment, [Ying Caihong]'s two subordinates are eager to step onto the iron rope bridge. Upon seeing this, [Hu Bayi] quickly speaks out to stop them. However, the two pay no attention to his advice, seeing no danger on the iron rope bridge, they let down their guard. Unbeknownst to them, eerie green ghostly fire is rising beneath their feet.
1:3:1|1:3:17|The two had never encountered such a bizarre formation. In a panic, they used both hands and feet to beat the dark fire beneath them. However, the dark fire, as they beat it, grew more and more intense, spreading in an instant to their legs and eventually engulfing their entire bodies.
1:3:21|1:3:41|[Shirley Yang] took off the bracelet and threw it onto the bridge, only to see the spot where the bracelet passed by igniting eerie green ghostly fire. Upon hearing this, [Hu Bayi] turned his head and gave a disdainful look. [Shirley Yang] met his gaze provocatively, knowing that the bridge would catch fire with just a touch.
1:3:43|1:3:53|[Hu Bayi] picked up a piece of cloth and wiped it on the bridge surface. With a crackling sound, the cloth in his hand ignited a dark green ghostly fire. [Hu Bayi] casually threw away the cloth.
1:4:35|1:4:42|[Hu Bayi] immediately took out the compass,
1:5:22|1:5:37|[Hu Bayi], [Wang Kaixuan], and [Shirley Yang] were the first to step onto the iron cable bridge. [Da Jinya] was worried, but the three of them paid no attention to his words, cautiously feeling their way forward on the bridge.
1:5:37|1:6:6|[Ying Caihong] and others on the shore watched as [Hu Bayi] and his group successfully crossed the iron cable bridge. Seeing [Hu Bayi] and the others pass safely, [Ying Caihong] and her group also stepped onto the iron cable bridge. [Hu Bayi] and his group, along with [Ying Caihong] and her team, stepped onto the maze-like iron cable bridge one after another, advancing in the underground ancient ruins where few had tread before. All around, only the sound of gurgling water and the swaying of people crossing the iron cable bridge could be heard.
1:6:6|1:6:11|The ancient ruins were crowded, yet still appeared very desolate.
1:6:16|1:6:31|As soon as [Hu Bayi] finished speaking, everyone left the eerie statue. [Ying Caihong] and her group approached, stepping onto the stone pillar and carefully examining the statue sitting on the skull base.
1:6:36|1:7:5|[Yangzi] received orders from [Ying Caihong], and immediately removed the copper emblem from the sculpture's chest and handed it to [Ying Caihong]. Before [Ying Caihong] could examine it closely, the sculpture suddenly underwent a transformation. Eerie green flames burst out from the sculpture's eyes and mouth, startling [Ying Caihong] and her companions. The flames quickly intensified, spreading across the entire stone pillar in an instant. [Yangzi] quickly shielded [Ying Caihong] and helped her escape. The green flames grew larger and seemed to have a spreading wildfire effect.
1:7:10|1:7:47|In the distance, Hu Bayi and his group noticed the abnormality of the stone pillar. The pillar was now unbearable under the blazing fire, cracking and breaking apart. Da Jinya urged Wang Kaixuan and the others to escape quickly. As the stone seats collapsed one by one, Hu Bayi and his group ran for their lives. Da Jinya lay on Wang Kaixuan's back as the four-person team successfully rushed to the exit. Hu Bayi looked back and saw that Ying Caihong's group was still trapped on the iron cable bridge.
1:7:50|1:7:56|Da Jinya's helmet was on fire, [Shirley Yang] acted quickly and slapped off Da Jinya's helmet.
1:8:1|1:8:10|[Hu Bayi] and the others made up their minds and headed towards the exit. Yangzi took out a fireproof asbestos suit for [Ying Caihong] to put on, marking the end of the fire crisis.
1:8:12|1:8:46|[Hu Bayi] and his group turned around and arrived at a spacious underground square. The square was filled with scattered rocks and countless white mists floating on the ground. Before Da Jinya could finish speaking, [Wang Kaixuan] directly threw Da Jinya off his back onto the ground.
1:8:47|1:9:25|[Hu Bayi] turned around and looked at [Wang Kaixuan] sitting on a rock. [Wang Kaixuan] took out a cigarette, and [Hu Bayi] looked at the cigarette in his hand, his expression changing instantly. [Wang Kaixuan] raised his head and stared at [Hu Bayi] beside him, with [Shirley Yang] in between the two. [Wang Kaixuan] stood up.
1:9:25|1:9:50|With an angry expression, [Hu Bayi] walked towards [Wang Kaixuan]. Upon hearing this, [Hu Bayi] stepped towards [Wang Kaixuan] and glared at him angrily. [Shirley Yang] seemed like a resentful young wife, with a face full of dejection, lost in thought. The two couldn't help but reminisce about the beautiful times 20 years ago, with herds of cattle and sheep running on the grassland under the setting sun.
1:9:50|1:10:24|[Hu Bayi] ignored [Wang Kaixuan]'s request, took a deep drag of his cigarette, and snatched the letter from [Wang Kaixuan]'s hand. [Wang Kaixuan] had written a love poem, then he grabbed [Hu Bayi] from behind. After releasing him, [Hu Bayi] finally began to carefully read the poem in his hand.
1:10:24|1:11:7|[Wang Kaixuan] was feeling extremely awkward for a moment. [Hu Bayi] couldn't help but laugh as he read the contents of the love poem in his hand. He stared at [Wang Kaixuan] in front of him. Ding Sitian pinned the military star that [Hu Bayi] gave her to her chest, serving it delicately with both hands, looking extremely awkward.
1:11:8|1:11:42|[Hu Bayi] gazed affectionately at Ding Sitian beside him. When Ding Sitian suddenly looked up and met his gaze, [Hu Bayi] quickly turned his head away. Ding Sitian didn't respond to his words, but looked at [Hu Bayi] with deep affection in her eyes, eagerly awaiting his next words.
1:12:17|1:12:53|[Wang Kaixuan] seemed to have noticed something? After speaking, [Wang Kaixuan] stood still on the spot, finished his words, chuckled self-deprecatingly, looked up and down at the [Hu Bayi] in front of him, his voice choked up.
1:12:53|1:13:26|[Hu Bayi] stared at [Wang Kaixuan]. After [Wang Kaixuan] finished speaking, [Hu Bayi] suppressed the sadness in his heart. Adjusting his emotions, [Wang Kaixuan] looked [Hu Bayi] up and down. With the conversation reaching this point, [Hu Bayi] recalled the cause of Little Ding's death 20 years ago. The accidental explosion of the mummy triggered the underground explosives, causing a deafening roar and a burst of endless flames and smoke.
1:13:27|1:13:49|Explosions were happening everywhere inside the underground construction, with flames shooting up and smoke filling the air. Countless rocks were flying around due to the shockwaves from the explosions. The underground construction was exploding more intensely, and raging fires were gushing out from all directions. [Wang Kaixuan] quickly pulled Ding Sitian into the elevator for cover.
1:13:49|1:14:19|[Hu Bayi] quickly started the elevator, which slowly ascended. The three of them thought they had escaped, but the flames chased after them along the elevator shaft. Suddenly, the elevator jammed, and Ding Sitian accidentally stepped through a wooden board and fell. [Hu Bayi] quickly bent down to grab Ding Sitian who was falling, shooting around. Ding Sitian made up his mind and then pulled out a knife.
1:14:19|1:14:28|Attempting to chop the wood with a knife, Ding Sitian accidentally drops the knife, leading to an explosion below. Ding Sitian is determined to go through with it.
1:14:29|1:14:52|With both hands breaking free from Hu Bayi's pull, Ding Sitian stood alone on the beam. Ignoring all advice, she listened to the calls of Hu Bayi and Wang Kaixuan, reaching out her arm and leaping into the air. Yet, just an inch short, Hu Bayi couldn't save Ding.
1:14:55|1:15:24|Ding Sitian accidentally fell into the fire below and was instantly engulfed by flames. With Ding Sitian's sacrifice, Hu Bayi and Wang Kaixuan managed to escape at the critical moment. Hu Bayi dragged the crying Wang Kaixuan to safety, but at the exit, flames shot up and thick smoke filled the air. Wang Kaixuan, struggling to accept Ding Sitian's sacrifice, was torn between wanting to rescue him from the fire and collapsing on the ground in tears.
1:15:24|1:15:39|[Hu Bayi] was also in great pain, only to see him holding back tears, standing still looking towards the raging fire, while [Wang Kaixuan] watched the incense burning quietly on the rock, feeling extremely heavy-hearted.
1:15:41|1:16:27|[Wang Kaixuan] pursed his lips slightly, calming his emotions. Upon hearing what [Wang Kaixuan] said, [Shirley Yang] was at a loss for words for a moment, not knowing how to console. [Wang Kaixuan] felt full of resentment in his heart, leaving [Shirley Yang] speechless and standing there.
1:16:27|1:16:55|[Hu Bayi] contemplated for a long time before making up his mind. He walked slowly to [Wang Kaixuan], smiling at him. Upon hearing this, [Wang Kaixuan] was extremely moved, choked up and almost unable to speak. [Wang Kaixuan] patted [Hu Bayi] heavily on the shoulder.
1:16:55|1:17:19|To make sure he wasn't mistaken, [Shirley Yang] beside him turned her head, saying so with her mouth, but her eyes were red, chewing gum quickly in her mouth. Her emotions were getting more and more excited, and it seemed like she was about to lose control.
1:18:32|1:19:7|[Hu Bayi] saw the compass on the ground behaving strangely. [Wang Kaixuan] kicked him away, and [Hu Bayi] took the opportunity to kick back fiercely while [Wang Kaixuan] was talking. He kicked him back repeatedly, but then heard a cracking sound. [Wang Kaixuan] stopped, lifted his foot to look down, and found that he had crushed [Hu Bayi]'s compass. [Hu Bayi] watched as his compass met this great misfortune.
1:19:7|1:19:32|Hu Bayi stood up quickly and walked forward to check the compass. He found that the compass had been broken into two pieces. He lifted his head, full of anger, and stared at Wang Kaixuan. Then he grabbed his collar. At this moment, a gunshot sounded in the distance, catching Hu Bayi's attention. He rushed to the source of the gunshot, but couldn't find Shirley Yang.
1:19:32|1:19:55|[Da Jinya] lay on the ground, unexpectedly [Ying Caihong] and her group appeared from all sides, surrounding the two. Before a word was spoken, [Wang Kaixuan] rushed out from the side.
1:19:55|1:20:11|[Hu Bayi] took the opportunity to join the battle, using his fists to knock down the enemies one by one. [Wang Kaixuan] was captured with both arms restrained by the enemy. At this moment, [Hu Bayi] arrived in time, kicked the enemy, and rescued him.
1:20:11|1:20:29|[Yangzi] leaped down from the rocks with a mountaineering axe in both hands, soaring through the air to strike towards the side of [Hu Bayi]. Seeing the axe coming down, [Hu Bayi] quickly dodged to the side, while [Yangzi] swiftly changed her moves, twisting her body. On the other hand, [Wang Kaixuan], though his arms were bound, gradually adapted. At this moment, [Hu Bayi] stood up.
1:20:29|1:20:35|[Yangzi] swung the ice axe, the two of them determined to fight again, [Yangzi] swung the axe horizontally.
1:20:35|1:20:58|[Hu Bayi] twisted his body and threw [Yangzi] to the ground, [Yangzi] rolled a few times and half sat up before throwing the axe at him. [Hu Bayi] reached out and grabbed [Yangzi]'s neck to subdue her, but [Yangzi] unexpectedly bit his arm and took the dagger from his leg. With a sudden turn, she broke free from [Hu Bayi]. Just then, [Wang Kaixuan] leaped high into the air and kicked out.
1:20:59|1:21:30|Kicking down [Yangzi] who was attacking with a knife, [Ying Caihong] shouted to halt the fight. In her hands, [Hu Bayi], [Wang Kaixuan], and [Shirley Yang] were subdued by [Ying Caihong]'s men. Still filled with anger, [Yangzi] pulled out an axe from the rocks and ran to assault [Shirley Yang].
1:22:37|1:23:10|One of the men took out a damaged compass from [Hu Bayi]'s backpack, enraging [Ying Caihong] who brandished her sword and gun in anger.
1:23:42|1:24:15|[Wang Kaixuan] and [Da Jinya] took advantage of [Hu Bayi] attracting the enemy's attention, trying to cut the ropes with rocks. Unexpectedly, many ancient artifacts fell from [Da Jinya]. Seeing the artifacts on the ground, [Wang Kaixuan] couldn't help but curse loudly.
1:24:15|1:24:32|[Da Jinya] quickly realized that he had been exposed and hurriedly picked up [Wang Kaixuan] to move to the side.
1:24:40|1:25:6|[Wang Kaixuan] and [Da Jinya] accidentally triggered a mechanism during their fight, leading [Hu Bayi] and his team to a new underground palace.
1:25:6|1:25:22|In this place, rugged rocks are seen, surrounded by a bottomless abyss with extremely eerie purple mist drifting around. Only a suspension bridge connects to the distance, at the bottom of the valley. [Hu Bayi] and his team take the lead, holding flashlights as they walk out of the passage.
1:25:41|1:25:48|[Shirley Yang] opened her mouth in astonishment,
1:25:57|1:26:9|Turning around with a sigh, he asked [Ying Caihong],
1:26:26|1:26:50|[Hu Bayi] and his team, under the coercion of [Ying Caihong], set foot on the iron cable bridge. [Shirley Yang] took the lead cautiously leading everyone onto the bridge, only to hear the bells on the bridge ringing loudly. [Hu Bayi] shone his flashlight onto the bridge, only to see it covered with patterns of the other shore flower. The rest of the team shone their flashlights outside the bridge, but the light was all blocked by this purple mist.
1:26:50|1:27:16|In front is still pitch black, not knowing when it will come to an end. [Da Jinya] felt a sense of horror here, and had to follow [Shirley Yang] ahead, walking cautiously. [Shirley] held up a flashlight and led the way. Suddenly, she stopped in her tracks, and in front of them, the purple mist gradually dispersed, revealing a circular passage.
1:27:17|1:27:33|Through the circular passage, a coffin resembling a flower bud can be seen in the distance. [Shirley Yang] and the others pass through the circular passage, stand on the stairs, and can't help but be amazed by the scene before them.
1:27:39|1:27:48|[Hu Bayi] and others strolled down the stairs and arrived at the huge circular platform where coffins were stored, exploring the dangers lurking in this place.
1:27:50|1:28:11|In the middle of the circular platform, there was a huge coffin resembling a flower bud, with thick iron chains attached to it. The base was intricately carved with images of amaryllis flowers and skull patterns, surrounded by scattered rocks, giving it an eerie appearance. Upon arriving, [Ying Caihong] saw the indentation of a skull on the base of the coffin, which excited her and made her rub her hands together.
1:28:11|1:28:36|Hastily taking out the three bronze plaques collected in the underground palace, [Ying Caihong] barely finished speaking when her men threw [Hu Bayi]'s equipment in front of them. [Hu Bayi] took out a candle from the equipment, solemnly placing it in the southeast corner of the tomb chamber, and slowly lit it with a lighter.
1:28:37|1:28:41|[Hu Bayi] saw that the candle was unharmed and stood up, walking towards [Shirley Yang].
1:28:42|1:29:2|[Shirley Yang] took out the touch gold talisman from her chest and solemnly put it around her neck. Seeing this, [Hu Bayi] couldn't help but smile. [Shirley Yang] glanced at [Wang Kaixuan] beside her. [Wang Kaixuan] couldn't resist blowing on his own hair. Then the three of them stood in a triangular formation, extending their left hands to touch each other's fingertips.
1:29:6|1:29:10|After the three of them finished reciting the slogan, they stacked their thumbs on top of each other, signaling the end.
1:29:15|1:29:34|[Ying Caihong] saw the three of them and couldn't help but show a smile. Then the three picked up the bronze emblem and walked towards the coffin. It could be seen that the three stood at three ends, surrounding the coffin in a triangular formation. [Hu Bayi] stood in front of the skull at the base of the coffin, staring at the groove on top, his face filled with unease.
1:29:35|1:29:57|[Wang Kaixuan] carefully examined the bronze emblem in his hand, while [Shirley Yang] held the touch gold talisman, looking uneasy. Shortly after, the three of them stepped forward, one foot on the base of the coffin, one hand holding the bronze emblem. The three of them stood nervously in front of the coffin, causing great anxiety to [Ying Caihong] in the distance.
1:29:57|1:30:14|[Hu Bayi] nodded to the other two, [Wang Kaixuan] and [Shirley Yang] were the first to place the bronze emblem into the recess, followed closely by [Hu Bayi], who placed his bronze emblem into the recess and slowly turned it.
1:30:15|1:30:38|The coffin suddenly made a loud noise, [Hu Bayi] couldn't help but look up at the coffin. [Hu Bayi] and the other two retreated from the base of the coffin, only to see the base slowly sinking. The bud-like coffin gradually opened as it rotated, revealing the corpse inside. The movement of the coffin made [Ying Caihong] and others unable to help but move forward to investigate, until the strange noise disappeared.
1:30:38|1:31:2|The coffin, resembling a bud, was completely opened, revealing the female corpse inside to everyone. The female corpse was dressed in a crimson silk butterfly skirt, holding a dark green disc with blood-red patterns. Suddenly, the candle in the southeast corner flickered, changing from bright red to a ghostly green. Just as the three were about to flee, a loud noise was heard.
1:31:7|1:31:25|[Shirley Yang] tried to grab the rock wall but failed. Seeing the danger, [Hu Bayi] leaped down and caught [Shirley Yang] who was falling. Ignoring their intimate embrace, he roared and shot out the Flying Tiger Claw, then swiftly pulled out the Diamond Umbrella and stuck it into the cliff, anchoring them in place.
1:31:26|1:31:51|[Hu Bayi] and [Wang Kaixuan] managed to stabilize their falling bodies, but the Flying Tiger Claw dropped downwards. Using the Golden Umbrella, they were pinned to the cliff face, watching the Flying Tiger Claw plummeting below. [Hu Bayi] looked up at [Wang Kaixuan], only to see corpses scattered below. [Hu Bayi] gazed down below and muttered to himself,
1:32:12|1:32:24|[Da Jinya] was hit back by [Yangzi] and fainted directly on the ground. Seeing [Da Jinya] faint, [Ying Caihong] then propped up a ladder and stepped towards the coffin.
1:32:35|1:32:42|Not only did he quicken the pace of climbing, but it wasn't until all three of them were out of danger that [Hu Bayi] spoke up.
1:33:7|1:33:22|[Ying Caihong] sat in front of the coffin, getting more and more excited as she spoke. At that moment, the disc in the hands of the female corpse was responding to [Ying Caihong]'s words.
1:33:30|1:33:57|Unexpectedly, a glaring blood-red light shone from the disc, leaving everyone stunned in place. A towering blood-red pillar shot out from the disc, dyeing the entire underground palace in a bloody hue, appearing eerie from afar. The blood-red pillar pierced through the dome of the underground palace, only to be absorbed by it and then burst out again. Startled by the scene before him, [Da Jinya] woke up.
1:34:3|1:34:22|Countless zombies holding swords were approaching [Da Jinya] and others. Seeing the situation, [Da Jinya] ran away, while [Ying Caihong] stood still. Dazed, [Ying Caihong] turned around and saw Mark, who had long been dead.
1:34:29|1:34:44|[Ying Caihong] pulled out a gun and fired several shots at the approaching Mark, but to no avail. In desperation, [Ying Caihong] pressed a ring, and countless tiny powders flew out from the ring. Meanwhile, [Yangzi] was still locked in a fierce battle with the zombies.
1:35:10|1:35:18|[Ying Caihong] casually took off the wig on her head as she spoke, revealing the hideous scar on her head.
1:35:26|1:35:56|[Yangzi] was attracted by the anomaly of [Ying Caihong], and the monster swung its arm directly knocking [Yangzi] into the abyss. Beside the high platform, [Ying Caihong] watched the continuously falling [Yangzi] with extreme sorrow. She then danced with the Kong Kong umbrella to clear the way for [Hu Bayi]. [Hu Bayi] immediately took out another Flying Tiger Claw and threw it towards the stone pillar. Standing on the stone pillar, [Hu Bayi] looked at the female corpse lying in the coffin and the disc in his hand with determination in his eyes.
1:35:56|1:36:14|[Hu Bayi] immediately pulled up the rope and swung towards the coffin, only to see numerous monsters leaping up from below, reaching out for the round plate in the hands of the female corpse. Unexpectedly, an arm extended from the plate, and the owner of the arm was the long-deceased Ding Sitian.
1:36:16|1:36:40|Upon hearing Hu Bayi's words, Ding Sitian felt a surge of strength in her heart. She tightly grabbed his arm as Hu Bayi exerted all his strength to save her. The two managed to escape before the explosion, and now they lay exhausted on the grass. Ding Sitian turned her head to look at Hu Bayi beside her.
1:36:47|1:37:1|Ding Sitian couldn't help but smile with happiness on her face, [Hu Bayi] also couldn't resist holding Ding Sitian's hand. Ding Sitian shyly turned her head away, but was captivated by a flower in front of her.
1:37:12|1:37:19|Ding Sitian reached out to pick the amaryllis flowers, but her hand was held by [Hu Bayi], who grasped Ding's hand.
1:37:22|1:37:34|Ding Sitian couldn't help but smile, and Hu Bayi was captivated by the badge on her chest, staring as if he had discovered a secret within it.
1:37:40|1:38:9|[Hu Bayi] looked at the badge in front of him and Ding Sitian, feeling particularly unfamiliar. However, he noticed that Ding Sitian's smile at this moment seemed particularly eerie. Ding Sitian then stood up and walked towards the distance. [Hu Bayi] reached out his hand trying to hold Ding Sitian, but it seemed like there was an invisible wall between them, separating the two. [Hu Bayi] kept tapping on the invisible wall between them, but seeing no effect, he directly used his head to hit it.
1:38:9|1:38:36|With the sound of shattering, the space shattered as well, [Hu Bayi] arrived in a blood-red chaotic space, where he also saw the true form of Ding Sitian, only to find it was the female corpse in the underground palace coffin. [Hu Bayi] desperately roared in the chaotic space, as soon as the female corpse finished speaking, the red-gold mask on her face dissolved, revealing Ding Sitian's face.
1:38:36|1:39:19|[Hu Bayi] calmed down instantly when he saw Ding Sitian's face. As Ding Sitian walked towards him, she spoke but received no response from [Hu Bayi]. He opened his hands and placed a round plate in the middle. However, he had a blank expression on his face, closed his eyes, pondered for a long time, seemed to have made a decision in his heart, and closed his eyes after hearing these words.
1:39:22|1:39:28|With these words, [Hu Bayi] had red eyes, tears already covering his face.
1:39:38|1:40:5|[Hu Bayi] quickly grabbed the disc in front of him, narrowly snatching it from the hands of the female corpse, and safely returned to his position using the rope. [Hu Bayi] steadied himself, raised his arm,
1:40:34|1:40:53|[Wang Kaixuan] listened to Xiaoding's words and conscientiously handed the round plate to Xiaoding. When [Wang Kaixuan] looked up, he found the plate in [Hu Bayi]'s hand, and Xiaoding was nowhere to be seen. After a long silence, [Hu Bayi] finally explained the truth to [Wang Kaixuan].
1:41:3|1:41:22|[Hu Bayi] spoke with tears in his eyes again at this point, only to see him tightly holding the disc and throwing it fiercely towards the base of the distant coffin. The disc flew slowly in the air, but it was bounced off by the base, and suddenly it slowly cracked from the center, leaving [Wang Kaixuan] stunned on the side.
1:41:27|1:41:44|As the cracking sound intensified, the cracks on the disc grew larger and larger. At this moment, [Shirley Yang] was pinned to the wall by a monster, but suddenly exploded into powder, saving [Shirley Yang]. The monsters attacking [Da Jinya] also exploded into powder.
1:41:44|1:41:50|Countless monsters around also turned into dust and disappeared as the disc was damaged.
1:41:51|1:42:20|Suddenly, the disc emitted a powerful suction force, transforming into a miniature black hole that swallowed up all the flying debris around it. As the debris was consumed, the disc could no longer hold together and shattered apart. [Hu Bayi] gazed at the shattered pieces of the disc, tears swirling in his eyes. The group watched the fragments of the disc, feeling a sense of unease in their hearts.
1:42:23|1:42:33|[Wang Kaixuan] shed tears directly, crying very sadly. At this moment, what did [Hu Bayi] seem to see? He hurriedly ran over.
1:42:36|1:42:58|Facing Shirley Yang's call, Da Jinya did not respond. At this moment, Hu Bayi quickened his pace and walked up to Shirley Yang, reaching out his hands to embrace her. Beside the coffin, Ying Caihong frantically picked up the broken pieces of the disc.
1:43:15|1:43:40|Accidentally, the newly found disc fragment was hung over the abyss. [Ying Caihong] reached out to grab it, but ended up falling down herself. As the underground palace was about to collapse, countless rocks fell from the dome, crashing down towards the fleeing crowd. [Wang Kaixuan] urged [Da Jinya] ahead.
1:43:41|1:43:50|As soon as they stepped onto the iron chain bridge, rocks fell and smashed the coffin, causing the broken iron chain bridge to rapidly slide and slam heavily against the cliff.
1:43:51|1:43:58|[Hu Bayi] and the others quickly stabilized their bodies and continued to climb upwards, as more and more rocks fell from the underground palace.
1:44:0|1:44:8|Seeing the situation becoming critical, [Hu Bayi] quickly called everyone to jump down. Several people immediately responded to [Hu Bayi]'s call and leaped down.
1:44:10|1:44:19|The group fell into the newly formed pool along with the falling rocks.
1:44:25|1:44:37|At this moment, Hu Bayi is singing folk songs by the lake on the grassland. He reaches into the lake, picks up a stone, and throws it vigorously towards the center of the lake. The stone spins rapidly on the surface of the lake, hitting four water floats before disappearing.
1:44:38|1:44:54|The originally calm lake surface suddenly generated a huge vortex, which greatly shocked Hu Bayi. The vortex became more turbulent, and the hole formed under the vortex seemed bottomless, as if directly connected to the core of the earth, it seemed to be about to swallow the entire lake.
1:44:58|1:45:10|Aji hurried back home in a panic, unaware that it was Hu Bayi and his team at the bottom of the lake, the flowing water on the dome continued, Hu Bayi and the others still couldn't find a way out, Da Jinya frantically thrashed his body next to Wang Kaixuan.
1:45:25|1:45:39|[Hu Bayi] and his team swam towards the distant coffin. [Shirley Yang] inserted the diamond umbrella under the coffin lid, exerted all her strength to pry it open. [Wang Kaixuan] also successfully pried open the coffin lid and threw the corpse inside out.
1:45:42|1:46:3|Hu Bayi then turned and swam towards Shirley Yang. Seeing Hu Bayi approaching, Shirley Yang quickly reached out and pulled him into the coffin. At this moment, the surrounding rock walls could not withstand the immense water pressure and shattered, allowing water to rush in. Hu Bayi and the others quickly closed the coffin lid, and the coffin drifted around in the water.
1:46:16|1:46:25|A mouthful bit into Wang Kaixuan's arm, the coffin swayed with the water flow, making Hu Bayi and Shirley Yang hiding inside extremely uncomfortable.
1:46:25|1:46:54|After a long time, the coffin carrying [Hu Bayi] and [Shirley Yang] suddenly emerged from the water, no longer swaying. The two hidden inside seemed to sense something, as [Hu Bayi] lightly tapped the coffin as if they had reached the surface. [Hu Bayi] and [Shirley Yang] struggled to push open the coffin lid, only to find the same dome above their heads. They did not escape with the water flow. [Hu Bayi] looked at the stone wall above.
1:46:55|1:47:5|With faces full of disappointment, [Hu Bayi] and [Shirley Yang] sat dejectedly on the coffin, looking around.
1:47:13|1:47:42|[Hu Bayi], faced with such a dangerous situation, actually smiled and turned to look at [Shirley Yang]. Seeing this, [Shirley Yang] couldn't help but walk up and embrace the dejected [Hu Bayi]. Upon hearing these words, [Hu Bayi] couldn't help but feel sorrowful, holding [Shirley Yang] tighter with both hands.
1:47:42|1:48:3|For a long time, the two separated, [Hu Bayi] smiled as he looked at [Shirley Yang] in front of him, still tightly holding [Shirley Yang]'s hands. [Shirley Yang] smiled and shook her head at [Hu Bayi], who gazed affectionately at her and couldn't help but reach out to stroke her hair and face.
1:48:3|1:48:12|The two of them looked at each other, and suddenly he grabbed [Shirley Yang]'s hands and tied them up.
1:48:13|1:48:21|[Hu Bayi] pulled out the Diamond Umbrella and stuffed [Shirley Yang] into the coffin.
1:48:36|1:49:14|[Hu Bayi] waved the Konggang umbrella and smashed the stone wall above his head, causing water to flow out. As [Shirley Yang] encouraged him, [Hu Bayi] became more determined in his chiseling. With [Hu Bayi]'s movements, the water instantly broke through the stone wall, and he was washed into the water. [Hu Bayi] floated aimlessly with the water flow, being ruthlessly battered by the scattered coffins around him.
1:49:14|1:49:18|But as the water flowed deeper and deeper, their traces gradually disappeared.
1:49:18|1:49:38|On the other hand, [Shirley Yang] was swaying in the coffin but not in danger. The coffin gradually floated to the surface, and a coffin suddenly emerged from the calm lake. [Wang Kaixuan] struggled to open the coffin from the inside and finally escaped from the underground palace. [Wang Kaixuan] could hardly bear the appearance of [Da Jinya].
1:49:48|1:49:58|He knocked him out directly, and another coffin appeared next to [Wang Kaixuan]. [Wang Kaixuan] pulled the coffin closer and knocked on it a few times.
1:50:5|1:50:38|It was not the coffin that [Hu Bayi] was riding in. At this moment, a noise caught the attention of [Wang Kaixuan]. He turned around and saw a new coffin. [Wang Kaixuan] focused his gaze and found [Hu Bayi]'s Flying Tiger Claw tied to the coffin. With a big laugh, [Wang Kaixuan] opened the coffin in front of him, only to find [Shirley Yang] lying inside, with no trace of [Hu Bayi]. This discovery excited [Wang Kaixuan].
1:50:40|1:50:53|Faced with Wang Kaixuan's inquiry, Shirley Yang did not answer him. Upon hearing Wang Kaixuan's words, Shirley Yang, who was curled up in the coffin, cried even more sadly. Wang Kaixuan, seeing Shirley Yang's expression, couldn't help but guess what was going on.
1:50:53|1:50:56|The expression immediately turned sad.
1:50:57|1:51:30|[Wang Kaixuan] stood up, his emotions particularly agitated. As soon as [Wang Kaixuan] finished speaking, he leaped into the water, trying to search for [Hu Bayi]'s whereabouts. Left behind were [Shirley Yang], who was crying uncontrollably in the coffin, and the unconscious [Da Jinya]. After a while, a strange sound came from the water's surface. At this moment, [Shirley Yang] was too preoccupied to notice. Suddenly, a figure swam towards the coffin and patted the crying [Shirley Yang].
1:51:32|1:51:49|[Shirley Yang] widened her eyes and couldn't help but slap [Hu Bayi], who was covered in water plants in front of her. [Shirley Yang] spoke,
1:51:58|1:52:8|[Wang Kaixuan] suddenly emerged from the water, looking extremely agitated.
1:52:32|1:52:46|[Hu Bayi] lightly brushed [Shirley Yang]'s ear and suddenly produced a ring, holding it between his fingers and placing it in front of [Shirley Yang].
1:53:11|1:53:40|Da Jinya was pushed into the water by [Shirley Yang]. He thrashed wildly in the water. [Shirley Yang] handed the ring she had taken from Da Jinya to [Hu Bayi], then extended her hand, indicating for him to put it on her finger. However, [Hu Bayi] hesitated at this moment, with a look of indignation on his face, gazing at [Shirley Yang]. He then put the ring on [Shirley Yang]'s hand and bent down to kiss her palm.
1:53:41|1:53:49|[Wang Kaixuan] is very disgusted by [Hu Bayi]'s lovey-dovey appearance, while Da Jinya floats on the water with a look of confusion on his face.
