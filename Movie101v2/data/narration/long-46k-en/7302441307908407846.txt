0:1:11|0:1:21|In the grassland pasture, Uncle Aken is playing the guitar and singing leisurely on horseback, while the two doctors at the medical station are airing out blankets. Uncle Aken sees the two doctors and speaks to them.
0:1:35|0:1:56|Dr. Gamilah waved goodbye to Uncle Aken with a smile. In the woods, three police officers from the Qingshan team, dressed in uniforms, were chasing two suspects non-stop. The galloping horses kicked up dust and mud on the ground. The two suspects, carrying packages, kept a close eye on the police behind them as they ran through the dense forest and entered the vast pasture.
0:1:56|0:2:2|They galloped away without leaving a trace, and the three policemen chased after them relentlessly, unwilling to give up.
0:2:3|0:2:16|They reached for the weapons behind them and issued a final warning to the suspects. The two suspects ignored the police's warning and continued to flee forward with the package in hand.
0:2:37|0:3:0|The police's rope accurately caught their necks, and after throwing the package to his teammate, he fell off the horse and landed heavily on the ground. Another suspect was successfully intercepted, and the police took the two back to the rescue station for questioning.
0:3:45|0:4:3|The police officer took down the lantern from the wooden pillar in the house and poured the kerosene inside onto the clothes. The captain shouted for [Fang Ming] to take out a match and light the clothes, using a tool to gently flip them to accelerate the burning. Before long, the clothes were reduced to ashes, [Jin Ye], it's your turn to go over.
0:4:53|0:5:23|Setting off with the Qing Shan team members riding horses towards Ha Xiong Gou. Ha Xiong Gou is located in a canyon where gold sand is produced by gold prospectors. They decide to go there to find out more. The gold prospectors in Ha Xiong Gou have clear division of labor and are well-organized. First, they will remove the stones from the riverbank, then put the mud and sand into baskets for the first screening and filtering, then transport it to the riverbank for simple washing through a wooden channel, and finally hand-wash it in the river by a specialist. The flowing river water carries away the fine mud and sand.
0:5:23|0:5:42|They finally obtained the precious gold sand. They were dressed in simple clothes and long rubber boots, standing in the cold river water, carefully panning for gold. Not far away, there was an old man with a white beard, a prospector with 30 years of gold panning experience. On a large rock in front of him, a fake gold nugget was solemnly placed.
0:5:42|0:5:47|He was devoutly using his homemade brush to draw on it [Jin Wang]. After finishing the drawing, he quickly knelt down.
0:5:48|0:6:2|From the bag he carried with him, he took out a gold drilling tube and began to pray. The dominant [Jin Wang] woman, wearing a leather jacket, was making new gold panning tools out of wood. At this moment, an uncle hurried over to him and said,
0:6:17|0:6:36|[Hei Pi] gathered three batches of gold and ran towards the Haixiong Valley. As he ran, he looked back to check the situation, never expecting someone to be waiting ahead. The old man mercilessly struck him with a stick, causing [Hei Pi] to fall heavily to the ground. The two immediately searched for the gold.
0:6:46|0:7:11|Without any warning, [Hei Pi] suddenly woke up and snatched the gold again. Even though he was knocked down, he refused to let go. Just as the old man was about to pick up a stick to strike again, [Fang Ming] arrived in time and stopped them. Seeing this, the two of them ran away, and the injured [Hei Pi] quickly took [Jin Wang] with him.
0:7:24|0:7:28|On the other side, a sweet photo of Dr. [Jiagamina] and [Hailati] hangs on the wall of the rescue station.
0:8:1|0:8:11|[Gamila] picked up the bag of gold on the table, glanced at [Hei Pi], and casually put the gold into the drawer of the bedside table. After [Leida] and [Alimu] walked out of the rescue station, they mounted their horses and left.
0:8:11|0:8:24|Under the influence of drugs, [Hei Pi] gradually regained consciousness. He opened his eyes to see the unfamiliar surroundings, the clean hospital bed, and [Jia Mila] in doctor's attire beside him, making him realize that he was lying in a medical station.
0:8:24|0:8:42|He quickly felt for the gold on his body, only to find it empty. As he turned his head, he saw the familiar cloth bag in the drawer, the very bag where he kept his gold. At that moment, [Jin Wang] was squatting on the ground, scrubbing clothes in a ceramic basin, completely unaware that danger was approaching.
0:8:42|0:8:44|[Hei Pi] picked up the firewood on the ground and glared fiercely at [Jin Wang].
0:8:45|0:8:57|He walked with a face full of shame, step by step, just as Jin Wang was about to turn around, Hei Pi picked up firewood and fiercely smashed it towards his head. After a scream, he fell to the ground and passed out, leaving Hei Pi in a state of panic.
0:8:57|0:9:4|He dropped the firewood and prepared to escape, but the ring on Kagmira's hand caught his attention. He quickly took off the ring and left in a panic.
0:9:5|0:9:16|Unexpectedly, [Jin Wang] and the others encountered [Hei Pi] halfway and had to return to the medical station. [Jin Wang] made a quick decision and changed the route to run in the opposite direction. When [Hei Pi] returned to the medical station, he saw a mess on the ground and felt that something was wrong.
0:9:50|0:10:5|The team member's words gradually calmed [Jin Wang] down. Ghamila was taken to the hospital, with various instruments inserted all over her body, lying on the sickbed on the verge of death. After adjusting the instruments, the nurse left the ward, leaving [Jin Wang] sitting by the sickbed, gently holding Ghamila's hand.
0:10:6|0:10:23|He caressed the middle finger of Gamilah, which should have had a ring on it, feeling extremely sorrowful. Holding Gamilah's hand, he pressed it against his cheek, unable to hold back the tears streaming down his face. He stared fixedly at his wife on the sickbed, tears rolling down his cheeks uncontrollably, with no time to spare for anything else.
0:11:7|0:11:21|[Hailati] hesitated to speak, looking disappointed. [Hei Pi] covered his wounds and walked unsteadily into the woods. Just as he was exhausted and in a sorry state, a girl with double ponytails, [Tutu], walked through the stones towards him.
0:11:21|0:11:31|He looked at [Hei Pi] with a puzzled expression, not saying a word. Soon after, [Hei Pi] was discovered by the gold prospectors. Inside the house, [Jin Ye] heard the commotion and quickly picked up the crystal tube and headed outside.
0:12:0|0:12:7|Hei Pi's answer undoubtedly sparked anger, and the fleeing guests punched and kicked him. Jin Ye, seeing this, expressed his own idea to Jin Wang.
0:12:22|0:12:32|[Hei Pi] was tied up by the crowd and dropped in mid-air. [Jin Wang] took off his leather jacket, casually threw it on the rocks, picked up a thick wooden stick, and slowly walked towards him.
0:12:32|0:12:40|[Jin Ye] sat on the side with his eyes closed, spinning the baton. [Jin Wang] picked up a wooden stick and fiercely stabbed [Hei Pi] in the abdomen with the thick end.
0:12:42|0:13:9|[Hei Pi] suddenly began to vomit violently. The vomit on the ground caught the attention of the gold prospectors. [Jin Ye] put away the gold panning bucket, picked out a piece of gold from [Hei Pi]'s vomit, and said to him with great seriousness.
0:14:33|0:14:45|Making everyone aware of the seriousness of the problem, a scale, a table, and a large tray were set up in the gold panning area. The fleeing gold diggers took out the gold they had panned and placed it in the tray.
0:14:45|0:14:57|[Jin Wang] prays in front of the golden lump, taking off his hat, clasping his hands together, closing his eyes, bowing his head in worship towards the golden lump. [Jin Ye] stands beside him, shaking a golden cylinder and muttering words under his breath.
0:14:57|0:15:15|Maintaining the order of the gold mining, the prospectors orderly approached, handing over their gold, and even shook their bags, afraid of missing a speck of gold. With everyone's efforts, the gold in the pan grew more and more, while the bound [Hei Pi] stared straight at the gold.
0:15:15|0:15:23|After escaping and being beaten, his clothes were covered in mud and sand, the bandage on his head was no longer clean, and the pain made his expression become fierce.
0:15:24|0:15:41|The gold in the pan is increasing, forming a small mountain. The riverbank where they used to work is now empty. The gold prospectors' year-long efforts are about to pay off. Through this final gold rush, they will receive their rewards and be able to pack up and head home.
0:15:43|0:15:58|As the sky darkens, the burning torches bring a glimmer of light to everyone. [Jin Ye], under the gaze of the crowd, wraps the gold into small packages and then weighs them to ensure each package has the same weight for fair distribution. [Jin Wang] also shares his thoughts with everyone.
0:17:10|0:17:29|The next day, a vast grassland stretched endlessly, with herds of cattle and sheep leisurely grazing. Camels carrying heavy goods obediently knelt on the ground, while the old herdsman unloaded his luggage from the camel and prepared to set up a tent. Not far away, the daughter shouted loudly.
0:17:32|0:17:36|Uncle Aken waved to his daughter and walked towards everyone with a straw mat in his arms.
0:17:51|0:17:56|Looking up, a large group of birds darkened the sky as they flew towards the crowd.
0:18:31|0:18:49|[Hailati] explained the situation to the chief and was waiting for his reply. Unexpectedly, at this moment, a large number of black birds in the sky caught his attention. He lowered his head thoughtfully, sighed deeply, and the warm sunlight shone on the vast grassland. Upon hearing [Jin Ye]'s advice, the herdsmen began to move their livestock to a new pasture.
0:18:49|0:19:4|They rode on tall steeds, wielding whips to drive the animals towards the right path. The migrating flock of sheep formed a beautiful sight, but the herdsmen had no time to appreciate it. They had to move to a safe place before the blizzard arrived.
0:19:4|0:19:23|As the sun sets and the sky darkens, a strong wind blows across the grassland, causing trees to bend and leaves to swirl in the air. The tools of the gold prospectors in Axiong Gully are blown off the ground, with iron buckets and tires rolling around. The tent made of reeds is also torn apart by the wind, prompting the prospectors to wrap themselves tightly in their clothes.
0:19:23|0:19:32|Jin Wang took shelter in the house of Jin Ye. On the other side, the herdsmen also faced a huge ceasefire, with sudden weather changes, dropping temperatures, and sandstorms filling the sky, making it impossible to keep their eyes open.
0:19:32|0:19:45|The short time made it extremely difficult for the herds of cattle and sheep to migrate. They put on their thick winter clothes and rode on horses to drive them away. They raised the whips in their hands to lash out, and the exhausted cattle also let out painful moans.
0:19:45|0:20:4|The next day, the mountains were covered with snow as far as the eye could see, only tall trees were visible, while the rest of the grass and shrubs had disappeared. Snowflakes fell like cotton from the sky, dressing the grassland in a cold coat. The herdsmen suffered major losses, and Uncle [Heilati] led his family in praying to the heavens.
0:20:4|0:20:8|They knelt in the cold snow, extending their hands in devout prayer.
0:20:37|0:20:52|Upon learning about the situation of [Hailati], [Fang Ming] looked worried. After a day and a night, the snow in Haxiong Gou finally stopped, and the gold prospectors began to emerge from their homes. [Jin Ye] also emerged from his small house. Covered in snowflakes, he carefully observed his surroundings.
0:20:55|0:21:1|[Jin Wang] found his door blocked by heavy snow, so he cleverly ran to the window to check the situation.
0:21:43|0:21:48|Jin Wang from the alliance approached Jin Ye, who was acting suspiciously, wanting to find out the truth.
0:22:45|0:22:50|At the same time, the sudden heavy snowfall also trapped the police officers at the checkpoint.
0:24:24|0:24:28|The rare blizzard that started at 19:00 yesterday has swept through the entire Ashan region.
0:24:29|0:24:42|In some sealed-off areas, the temperature has dropped to minus 45 degrees Celsius. A bigger blizzard is expected to hit in two to three days, possibly setting a new historical record. Currently, many roads leading to the mountainous regions have been blocked by heavy snow.
0:24:42|0:24:54|The government and the stationed troops in Ashan region have set up relief stations in the pastoral areas and towns where vehicles can pass through. The government requires the herdsmen to move to the relief stations as soon as possible for timely assistance. At the same time, those herdsmen who cannot be gathered are required to persist in self-rescue.
0:24:55|0:25:14|Do not give up hope of survival. The government and the stationed troops will do their best to conduct search and rescue. Customer number 24 is stranded on the road in the wilderness, the situation is very dangerous. Lane 26 is blocked with a large number of vehicles, people need to be rescued. Customer number 24 is stranded on the road in the wilderness, the situation is very dangerous.
0:27:11|0:27:28|After the meeting, [Jin Wang], the leader of the Qingshan team, immediately set off with his team members. They rode their new snowmobiles equipped with radios and headed non-stop towards the Heifengkou checkpoint. The snowmobiles left tracks in the snow as they braved the harsh wind and snow, determined to reach their destination.
0:27:28|0:27:45|At this moment, the Black Wind Pass checkpoint was quiet, with an eagle perched on a stone at the entrance, squawking incessantly. The alliance of people emerged from the tents to investigate, and a note tied to the eagle's foot by [Hailati] brought hope to everyone. Captain Liu took the note and examined it.
0:28:43|0:29:0|[Jin Wang] and his small team reached a consensus and formed a mighty team, then set off towards the Black Wind Pass inspection station. The thick chicken blood reaching their knees was nothing to them, as they held shovels and hoes, advancing aggressively towards the inspection station.
0:29:0|0:29:6|They were wearing hats, scarves, and coats, with a thick blanket on their backs. Their eyes were firm and their spirits were high.
0:29:14|0:29:21|Captain Liu realized the situation was dire, so he quickly brought Xiao Zhang to the entrance of the checkpoint and called for his brothers to start setting up defenses.
0:29:29|0:29:52|Ali Mu heard Liu Zhanchang's orders and quickly locked the gate with an iron chain, then drove the only car to the front of the checkpoint, just to stop the escaping passengers from Beijing. With a command from Auntie, the girls all lined up in front of the queue.
0:30:14|0:30:20|The gold prospectors spread the blankets on the iron wire pattern, cooperated to climb over the gate, and threw their tools inside.
0:30:30|0:30:34|Together, Jin Wang, Fang Ming, Jin Ye, and Hei Pi worked together to move the car and used a utility pole to break open the gate of the checkpoint.
0:30:55|0:31:2|The persuasion of several police officers was completely ineffective, meanwhile, Jin Wang and the team were urgently trying to control the situation and were doing their best to handle it.
0:31:4|0:31:23|[Jin Wang] kept urging everyone to move towards Death Valley. The kind-hearted guests rushed towards the mountaintop. At this moment, halfway up the mountain, [Jin Ye] suddenly stopped. He adjusted his hat and subtly signaled to [Jin Wang] to stop moving forward. Lao Mao appeared to be cheering everyone on and leading the way, but in reality, he also stopped in his tracks.
0:31:25|0:31:29|[Hailati] and the team rode snowmobiles to the top of the mountain.
0:31:37|0:31:49|The gold prospectors rushed towards the mountains along the main road, completely unaware that [Jin Wang] and [Jin Ye] had already taken a small path up the mountain with their gold panning team. They passed through the forest, trudging through thick snow, making their way towards the mountaintop.
0:31:49|0:31:59|The gold prospectors have been blinded by the legend of the Snowy Grand Realm, roaring faithfully as they set off into the mountains. Fortunately, [Heilati] and the team stopped them.
0:32:2|0:32:8|The appearance of Team Qingshan made everyone stop in their tracks, filled with questions.
0:32:38|0:32:45|Kang Xue has already decided at the command post that he will never risk going down the mountain to mine for gold in the Kuzi Jinsha, nor will he forcibly acquire it.
0:34:2|0:34:19|[Hailati] listened and a hint of ruthlessness flashed in his eyes. The government set up a relief point on the grassland, where relief supplies brought by military vehicles were distributed through the river and then transported to the relief station in the mountains by horse-drawn carriages. Inside the tents was a temporary medical station, providing free physical examinations for the herdsmen.
0:36:11|0:36:22|Hundreds of carriages carrying supplies set off in a grand procession. They were adorned with bright flags, dressed in thick military coats, and divided into three groups heading towards the relief station in the mountains.
0:36:29|0:36:38|The orderly line in the snow forms a beautiful scenery. The experienced herdsman, [Hei Pi], raises the whip in his hand, leading the team towards the right path.
0:37:18|0:37:25|The crowd immediately ran towards the tent upon hearing the news. [Hei Pi] quickly walked to the radio station, took off his leather gloves, and put them to his ear to respond.
0:38:20|0:38:29|[Jin Wang] led the gold panning team to continue moving forward, with the endless scenery of the mountains in sight, no trees, only vast snow-covered land. [Jin Ye] spoke to everyone.
0:38:33|0:38:59|Tonight, with the support of [Jin Wang], leading the way ahead, the others followed them as they continued to move forward. Uncle [Aken] is leading the rescue team and rushing towards the Black Wind Pass checkpoint. The grand procession stands out in the vast snowy field, with running horses kicking up snowflakes. Experienced herdsmen crack their whips and drive the horse-drawn carriages. [Heilati] has also set out on the search for people.
0:39:16|0:39:23|[Uncle Aken] led the rescue team to the Feihonghou checkpoint, where over a hundred refugees trapped there cheered happily upon seeing them.
0:40:7|0:40:12|This is the place where the legendary pillowcase was found, and the guests here call it Golden Valley.
0:40:23|0:40:33|By the following spring, the bodies began to decay, infecting all living creatures in the valley with a plague, even the wolf packs were not spared. Since then, the locals have referred to this place as Death Valley.
0:40:41|0:40:46|The footprints in the snow were blown away by the strong wind, and [Fang Ming] got out of the car and raised his own question.
0:41:51|0:41:54|Later I blamed him, but he said.
0:42:11|0:42:22|[Hailati] shared his thoughts with his teammates and decided to continue moving forward. [Uncle Aken] was worried about everyone's safety and decided to bring supplies with a snow shovel pear to rescue them.
0:42:22|0:42:33|The weather in the Land of Death became increasingly severe, with howling winds and snow filling the sky. Even the wolf pack in the valley lost their way, as the biting wind kept the three of them huddled together.
0:42:38|0:42:53|[Hailati] looked at the snow in front of him and sensed a hint of danger. He squatted down, picked up a handful of snow, formed it into a snowball, and threw it into the snow. The snowball hit the ground and created a large pit, which was soon filled up by the blowing snow.
0:43:23|0:43:36|The gold mining team stood on the hillside, throwing stones at Jin Wang, Fang Ming, and Jin Ye. In order to avoid the attack, they had to roll down the hillside. As soon as Hei Pi stood up, his leg was hit by a stone and he fell heavily to the ground.
0:43:51|0:43:58|Sadik opened his backpack and found the radio inside shattered into pieces. Looking at the damaged radio, everyone was furious.
0:44:2|0:44:12|[Hailati] looked at the broken radio in silence, as the rescue team led by Uncle Aken and the Green Mountain team members, along with supplies, had already set off.
0:44:27|0:44:50|The situation in Death Valley is very dangerous. The two of them brought branches and did a simple bandage for Radar. Radar sat in the snow, grimacing in pain. Sadik lifted his leg, placed a stick underneath, and [Helati] took out a rope to help bandage him. The intense pain made Radar unable to help but cry out, and they built a fire in the snow.
0:44:50|0:44:56|On the distant hillside, a pack of wolves is staring at them. This is the only way to Death Valley.
0:45:23|0:45:31|Defense Bureau, we have lost contact with [Jin Wang] and his team for over three hours. In addition, the recent weather forecast indicates that...
0:45:34|0:45:42|If they can't come out before 4 p.m. tomorrow, the temperature in Death Valley will drop to more than fifty degrees below zero since the blizzard. By then, no one will survive.
0:45:44|0:45:55|[Hailati] set out alone on the road to find gold prospectors. Along the way, he used a knife to pierce the bark of trees to leave marks. With a bundle on his back, he proceeded towards Death Valley following the route from his memory.
0:45:55|0:46:10|[Jin Ye] led the gold panning team to arrive at Death Valley. He was very excited when he saw the scene in front of him. He quickly signaled the young man to put him down, adjusted his hat, and hurriedly ran into Death Valley. Seeing this, everyone immediately followed suit.
0:46:11|0:46:17|The scene in front of them stunned everyone present, with the stone path stretching neatly to the foot of Death Valley.
0:47:31|0:47:42|After Sadiq finished speaking, he turned and walked towards the woods. The gold mining team set up a bonfire and continued digging. Jin Ye and Jin Wang kept picking up stones, distinguishing them carefully, afraid of missing the pillowcases.
0:47:44|0:48:2|At night, as the temperature in the canyon dropped, the gold panning team followed [Jin Ye] to a cave. Holding torches for light, they cautiously entered. The cave was overgrown with weeds, a desolate scene. With the torches, they gradually saw the situation inside the cave.
0:48:2|0:48:6|They stepped on the dry weeds and walked step by step towards the depths of the cave.
0:48:7|0:48:16|Following the footsteps of [Jin Ye], everyone walked cautiously, not daring to make a sound. [Jin Ye] looked at the familiar things in the cave and couldn't help but sigh.
0:48:33|0:48:51|In the snowy fields outside the east, everyone quickly picked up torches and went to investigate. Several bone frames on the ground shocked everyone.
0:49:9|0:49:19|Hei Pi, strong and agile, gradually came to his senses. He adjusted his hat and, along with everyone else, began to carefully move the bone frame on the ground.
0:49:27|0:49:32|The gold prospectors took out lanterns and bedding from their packages, preparing to camp in the cave.
0:49:48|0:50:0|While everyone was busy burying the bone frame, [Jin Ye] sneaked away. [Hei Pi] was carrying a bundle of firewood in the snow, but in the next moment, she slipped and had an accident.
0:50:21|0:50:29|A huge snow pit flowed into the man-eating black hole, swallowing Jin Wang. A gust of snowstorm blew in, and there was no trace of the fall.
0:50:34|0:50:45|Radar crawled towards Sadik with his injured right leg. Unfortunately, the snow pit was nowhere to be found at this point, and the clearance team continued to search tirelessly for the pillowcase.
0:51:53|0:52:2|Rabbit squatted beside the tiger pile, adding firewood, completely unaware that [Hei Pi] had been staring at him, while the gold prospectors continued to search for the pillowcase with their tools.
0:52:2|0:52:19|In the basket were everyone's rations, with only Tu Tu left in the cave. He filled the teapot with water and placed it on the tiger pile to heat up, then brought a towel to the hot spring. Taking off his warm hat, he looked at his reflection in the water, tidied his braided hair, and prepared to wash up.
0:52:19|0:52:39|[Hei Pi] quietly entered the cave with a bundle of firewood in his arms, his eyes fixed on the back of the rabbit. He slowly approached the tiger's den and set down the firewood. The sudden noise startled the rabbit, who quickly stood up and looked at [Hei Pi] with a wary expression as he approached.
0:52:53|0:53:0|Hei Pi took out the ring he snatched from Gamila and said affectionately to Tu Tu.
0:53:22|0:53:33|At this moment, [Jin Ye] walked into the cave holding a stone, [Hei Pi] immediately stood up strong and ran away in a panic. [Jin Ye] looked at his strange behavior and already had an answer in his heart.
0:53:33|0:53:41|Rabbit Rabbit slowly came to his senses, quickly putting away the ring. [Jin Ye] looked at the flustered Rabbit Rabbit, leisurely walking to his side, and said with great emphasis.
0:53:44|0:53:55|Rabbit was at a loss and dared not answer, so he ran out of the cave with his head down. [Jin Ye] watched his departing figure, then looked at the stone in his hand, walked quickly to the hot spring and squatted down to start washing the stone.
0:53:58|0:54:9|[Jin Wang] also entered the cave at this time. [Jin Ye] sensed movement behind him, quickly threw the stone aside, casually picked up another stone to inspect, muttering to himself. [Jin Wang] slowly approached him.
0:54:29|0:54:41|[Jin Ye] heard this and turned to look at [Jin Wang], without answering. The weather was cold, and he couldn't help but cough. Seeing this, [Jin Wang] smiled and patted his back. The two of them didn't notice at all that [Hei Pi], hidden in the shadows, was watching them.
0:55:5|0:55:19|Uncle Aken led the rescue team through the heavy snow towards Death Valley. Inside the cave, [Jin Ye] was sitting on the ground smoking, carefully recalling the events of the past few days, trying to find clues about the pillowcase.
0:55:19|0:55:34|He suddenly recalled the sound of the stone falling to the ground when he was moving the bone frame that day, and suddenly realized. He walked quickly towards the stone, reached out a hand to pick it up, but the pillowcase slipped from his hand and fell heavily to the ground.
0:55:35|0:55:49|He excitedly held up the pillowcase with both hands, wiping away the surface dust, his eyes filled with disbelief. He took the stone to the riverbank to clean it. After scrubbing for a moment, the pillowcase gradually revealed its original appearance.
0:56:2|0:56:17|Suddenly, a figure flashed at the entrance of the cave, [Jin Ye] immediately changed his expression, quickly throwing the pillow into the hot spring. On the other side, [Hei Pi] had been moving in the snow all night, the situation was very dangerous. Fortunately, Uncle Aken and the rescue team arrived in time and found him.
0:56:25|0:56:31|The radar's badge was very conspicuous in the snow. The police immediately turned him over and recognized his identity.
0:56:57|0:57:10|Everyone untied the radar's clothes, exposing his limbs, and began rubbing his body with cloth non-stop, hoping to revive him. After rubbing for a while, Uncle Aken spoke out his thoughts.
0:57:23|0:57:43|Upon hearing Captain Liu's explanation, Uncle Aken stopped talking. He continued to help Radar massage his body. Xiao Zhang looked at the horse on the hill with some reluctance. After hesitating for a moment, he still fired the gun. Uncle Aken prayed devoutly to the sky, while [Fang Ming] swiftly raised his knife and cut open the horse's belly.
0:58:2|0:58:23|Just received the horse blood, and it had already frozen into ice in no time. [Fang Ming] used a knife to crush the horse blood and fed it to Radar by hand. Uncle Aken also considerately took out a felt, but Radar, who was frozen stiff, couldn't open his mouth and remained unconscious. In desperation, [Fang Ming] pried open his mouth and fed him the horse blood bit by bit.
0:58:23|0:58:29|With the careful care of everyone, Jin Wang gradually regained consciousness, and everyone showed a satisfied smile at the scene.
0:58:44|0:58:47|Looking along the radar's line of sight, Jin Wang saw only a bundle of firewood.
0:58:52|0:59:7|[Fang Ming] and two team members hurried towards the hill where the firewood was located, only to be heartbroken by the scene before them, a huge slope appeared in front of them, [Hei Pi]'s hat lay lonely in the snow.
0:59:7|0:59:15|[Hailati] has been buried by heavy snow, leaving no trace behind. The pure snowflakes have turned into sharp blades, taking away [Hailati]'s life.
0:59:16|0:59:24|The three of them were deeply saddened by the situation, they sorrowfully took off their hats and paid a solemn tribute to [Hera].
1:0:48|1:1:5|[Jin Ye]'s words undoubtedly sparked controversy. He was grabbed by a man, punched to the ground, and then a fight broke out among the crowd. Seeing his fellow villager being attacked, [Jin Wang] picked up a stick and joined the battle. [Jin Ye] was terrified and quickly hid to the side, as the fight between people from Gansu and Ningxia officially began.
1:1:12|1:1:24|Lao Meng said as he grabbed Jin Wang from behind and wrestled him to the ground, the two struggling in the dark alley. The dim cave was a mess, and as the situation grew tense, Ma Dongmei quickly grabbed the package and ran towards the rabbit hole.
1:1:39|1:1:50|Auntie Ma screamed and ran back into the cave, causing panic among the others who looked vigilantly at the cave entrance. Uncle Ken and the rescue team also noticed the markings on the tree ahead.
1:3:4|1:3:21|A swirling sound came from above, and everyone looked up curiously. Despite the lack of rain, a powerful airflow rushed into the cave, frightening everyone who quickly retreated into the cave. At the same time, [Jin Ye] took advantage of the chaos to run to the hot spring to fetch a towel, but was spotted by [Jin Wang].
1:3:21|1:3:28|The strong wind extinguished the bonfire, leaving the cave pitch black. Outside the cave, the collapsing snow cascaded down like a flood.
1:3:29|1:3:43|The entrance was completely blocked by heavy snow. The people inside the cave were still puzzled at this moment. After the avalanche ended, they all raised their inner questions.
1:4:16|1:4:21|[Jin Wang] knocked [Hei Pi] unconscious with a stone and took away his flashlight.
1:4:33|1:4:39|[Jin Wang] quickly crouched down and searched [Hailati] thoroughly, but found nothing in the end.
1:4:53|1:5:0|The uncle lit a torch with a match, and [Hei Pi] gradually regained consciousness in the light of the fire.
1:5:45|1:6:19|We should listen to him. Our lives are more important. Everyone took tools and started digging at the entrance of the cave. [Jin Ye] stood aside holding a flashlight to illuminate for everyone, while [Jin Wang] directed everyone's actions with a flashlight.
1:6:26|1:6:31|Ma Er Gu held a shovel and approached [Fang Ming] quietly.
1:6:47|1:6:58|[Rabbit] scooped water from the hot spring into a pottery jar and brought it to [Hera]. Seeing this, [Hera] graciously thanked him and said to him.
1:7:32|1:7:36|The Rabbit Gang helped [Hailati] untie the rope, and accidentally the ring fell out.
1:8:14|1:8:19|Tu Tu looked at [Hei Pi] in a panic, not knowing what to do, and [Hailati] quickly ran towards [Hei Pi].
1:8:43|1:8:57|[Hailati] pressed [Hei Pi] onto the snow pile, looking at him fiercely, angrily pointing a gun at [Hei Pi]'s head. [Jin Ye] on the side was also shocked. Uncle Aken led the rescue team, which had already arrived at the valley entrance, the cave.
1:8:57|1:9:11|[Hailati] also picked up a shovel and joined the team digging through the snow. They dug out a passage, feeling their way forward bit by bit with the shovel. Meanwhile, [Hei Pi] was tied up and thrown into the cave, frantically looking around, trying to break free from the ropes.
1:9:12|1:9:23|Not far away, [Jin Wang] and [Jin Ye] are sitting together talking. Half of the snow has been dug out by everyone, and they are throwing the snow they dug out into the cave, step by step exploring towards the cave entrance.
1:9:32|1:9:45|A small hole was slowly poked open, and [Jin Wang] struggled to crawl out from inside. He widened the hole with a shovel, and then the fugitives also struggled to climb out from inside one after another.
1:9:45|1:9:54|Looking at the magnificent snow-covered scenery outside, everyone was successfully rescued. [Fang Ming] pulled them out one by one and kindly reminded them.
1:10:9|1:10:23|In the midst of the battle, [Jin Wang] approached [Hei Pi], took off his padded jacket, and cut the rope binding him with a knife. [Hei Pi], strong and somewhat surprised by the favor, looked at [Jin Wang] as he squatted in front of him and spoke.
1:11:11|1:11:17|[Jin Wang] did not respond to [Hei Pi]'s words, picked up the cotton coat and left quietly. [Hei Pi] gazed at his back for a long time.
1:11:22|1:11:31|It's already past 1 o'clock now, and the rescue team still hasn't found Jin Wang and Fang Ming. If there's no better way, they will both be trapped and die in Death Valley.
1:11:35|1:11:53|A blizzard is about to trigger Death Valley. In order to timely rescue the gold prospectors and police in Death Valley, [Fang Ming] decides to send out two helicopters for the rescue mission. The staff prepares supplies and stretchers for the helicopters, and two medical personnel are also on board. [Hei Pi] leads the gold prospectors to start the return journey.
1:12:0|1:12:15|After walking out of the woods, [Jin Wang] gave a signal to [Hei Pi]. Understanding immediately, [Hei Pi] broke free from the ropes, took out a dagger, walked quickly towards the rabbit, and kidnapped it with the dagger.
1:14:7|1:14:13|[Jin Ye] saw everyone rescuing Tu Tu, so he left the team alone. [Jin Wang] immediately followed suit.
1:14:56|1:15:9|[Hei Pi] secretly hid the pistol in his sleeve and cunningly followed the crowd towards the rescue team. [Hailati] breathed a sigh of relief as she watched the gold digger return to his senses, then turned to search for her own pistol in the snow.
1:15:9|1:15:25|The gold prospectors looked at the two trucks as if they had seen the dawn of hope, carrying their luggage and running towards the rescue team. Uncle Aken drove the truck but stopped halfway down the slope. The rescue team, eager to save people, had no awareness of the danger, and Uncle Aken quickly intervened.
1:16:20|1:16:33|[Jin Ye] squatted down and took out a clean floral cloth from his shoulder bag. He took off his gloves, trembling hands carefully unfolding it. A pink and delicate handkerchief appeared in front of the two.
1:16:36|1:16:46|[Jin Ye] was distracted by the helicopter in the sky, and [Jin Wang] followed his gaze. After a moment, he came back to his senses and said to [Jin Ye].
1:16:57|1:17:13|[Jin Ye] subconsciously stepped back, only to anger [Jin Wang]. He took out a dagger and slowly advanced towards [Jin Ye]. Seeing this, [Jin Ye] quickly ran towards the hillside. [Jin Wang] followed and tackled him in the snow, wielding the dagger in an attempt to kill him.
1:17:39|1:17:58|At a critical moment, [Hailati] tackled [Jin Wang], while [Jin Ye] looked at his injured right hand and sighed. The helicopter successfully locked onto the position of the crowd and prepared to land. The huge rotor stirred up a gust of snow, causing everyone to be unable to open their eyes. They quickly covered their cheeks with their sleeves.
1:18:22|1:18:33|[Hailati] and [Jin Wang] are wrestling together, he kicks [Jin Wang] in the abdomen, then punches him down to the ground. [Jin Wang] picks up a dagger dropped in the snow and stabs towards [Hailati].
1:18:33|1:18:49|[Hailati] quickly made a defensive posture to resist, but he was still cut through his clothes and knocked down by a punch. As he was about to get up, he was kicked in the head by him, letting out a painful scream. [Jin Wang] looked at [Hailati], pointing a knife at him, and issued the final warning.
1:19:15|1:19:29|[Hailati] dropped his backpack and pounced on [Jin Wang]. He grabbed [Jin Wang]'s arm and threw him over his shoulder, slamming him to the ground. Just as [Jin Wang] was trying to get up, he grabbed his collar, hit him on the head, and knocked him down hard.
1:19:29|1:19:41|[Jin Wang] was beaten to the point where he couldn't fight back, and the dagger in his hand had already fallen into the snow. [Hei Pi] hit every vital point with precision in each move. After a few rounds, [Jin Wang] was knocked down to the ground.
1:19:44|1:19:51|From a distance on the hillside, [Hei Pi] quietly watched everything. [Hailati] looked at [Jin Wang] on the ground.
1:20:2|1:20:18|[Jin Wang] took the opportunity while [Fang Ming] was speaking to pick up the dagger on the ground and fiercely stabbed towards him. Although [Fang Ming] reacted quickly and discovered it in time, he was still knocked to the ground by [Jin Wang]. [Jin Wang] used all his strength to stab the dagger towards [Fang Ming].
1:20:18|1:20:28|[Jin Ye] saw [Jin Wang] being so ruthless and crazy, and viciously smashed him on the back of his head with the pillow tendon in his hand. After a painful howl, [Jin Wang] fell to the ground.
1:20:29|1:20:35|[Jin Wang] slowly stood up with a dagger in hand, [Jin Ye] gestured for [Hei Pi] to leave first, but unexpectedly faced rejection.
1:20:51|1:21:11|The two pushed each other down the hill. [Jin Wang] was about to chase after them when a stone caught his attention. He squatted down, stuck his dagger into the snow. As he picked up the stone, before he could be happy, a gunshot rang out behind him. [Hei Pi] appeared in the snow with a pistol.
1:21:11|1:21:19|[Jin Wang] stood up, looking at him incredulously. Unexpectedly, the ruthless [Hei Pi] fired again, hitting [Jin Wang] directly in the heart.
1:21:24|1:21:39|The stone finally slipped from [Jin Wang]'s hand and fell heavily into the snow, triggering two gunshots that caused a massive avalanche. A large amount of snow poured down from the top of the mountain in an instant, rushing down the mountain.
1:22:17|1:22:25|Greedy [Hei Pi] approached [Jin Wang], picked up a stone, and laughed happily, completely unaware that a massive avalanche was heading towards him from behind.
1:22:32|1:22:47|[Hailati] looked at the large amount of snow falling lightly, turned around, and ran towards the helicopter's position. The snow quickly flowed, and the strong airflow immediately blew [Jin Wang] and [Hei Pi] out. The police officer on the helicopter quickly threw down the rope ladder.
1:22:48|1:23:6|The rope ladder swayed in the air, [Jin Wang] gasping for breath, took a big step onto the ladder, with blood flowing behind him, instantly flooding the valley. The helicopter officially took off, and [Jin Wang] was successfully rescued at the last moment, the helicopter taking them away from this dangerous area.
1:23:6|1:23:22|The soft rope ladder swayed back and forth in the wind, [Hailati] held onto it tightly, feeling relieved. [Hailati] looked down and saw the milky white clouds surging forward. The trees in the canyon were also engulfed by countless snowflakes.
1:23:22|1:23:33|The helicopter flew over the treacherous Death Valley, with the flowing snow below resembling a rushing Yellow River, majestic and grand. Tonight, [Jin Wang] looked down at the flowing snow beneath his feet, lost in thought.
1:23:39|1:23:53|Captain Liu successfully pulled [Hailati] back onto the helicopter. Then, they quickly retracted the rope ladder and closed the cabin door. The helicopter flew smoothly in the air, and two medical staff came to urgently treat everyone's wounds.
1:23:56|1:24:3|[Jin Ye] thanked the medical staff with a look of sorrow on his face, while Uncle Aken, who was familiar with him, walked up to him and spoke to him.
1:24:21|1:24:38|Tonight, Jin Wang took the pancake handed over by Uncle Aken, his eyes filled with gratitude. He looked at the pancake in his hand, feeling guilty as he glanced at the exhausted Fang Ming beside him. After a moment of contemplation, he handed the pancake to the old man next to him and carefully took out a piece of handkerchief from his pocket.
1:24:38|1:24:47|Under the astonished gaze of the crowd, he caressed the pillowcase in his hand, then lifted his head and said to [Hailati].
1:24:50|1:25:0|Tonight, [Hei Pi] knelt in front of [Jin Wang], tremblingly handing over a pillowcase to him.
1:25:21|1:25:36|Uncle Aken helped Jin Ye up and put him back in place, while Hailati took the heavy pillow from Captain Liu's hands and looked meaningfully at Jin Ye. The helicopter returned to the rescue station along the route, and the snow in the sky was falling heavier and heavier at this moment.
1:25:38|1:25:48|On that day, the A Mountain area experienced the heaviest snowfall in 50 years. With the assistance of the local government, all the disaster victims were properly resettled.
