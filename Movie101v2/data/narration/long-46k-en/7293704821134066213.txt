0:0:59|0:1:19|In a misty forest, towering ancient trees reach high into the sky as if they have existed for hundreds of years. However, not far away, three people with chainsaws are moving through the woods, constantly looking around and selecting the most suitable targets.
0:1:20|0:1:36|The mist in the forest was thick, as if nature was trying to stop the three of them. However, determined in their mission, they only focused on searching for valuable trees. Before long, they arrived at a tall and sturdy tree, and [Su Lin], who was leading the way, spoke up.
0:1:39|0:1:50|[Yang Tianfang] watched as his father walked up and carefully observed the tree. It was indeed larger than the others, with a thick trunk towering into the sky. Just as he was about to take action, he heard someone next to him say.
0:1:53|0:2:7|Looking ahead, there are also several good-looking targets in the distance. Once the targets are identified, [Yang Tianfang] starts up the chainsaw and begins preparing to fell the trees, continuously emitting the roaring sound of the chainsaw, creating a stark contrast with the tranquil and peaceful forest.
0:2:7|0:2:14|[Tan Qing] slowly pushed the high-speed running chainsaw into the tree trunk, causing the sap to gradually seep out from the bark and flow down the chainsaw.
0:2:15|0:2:31|Using a chainsaw to fell trees was as easy as cutting tofu, without any obstacles. In no time, a large tree as thick as a person fell with a loud crash. One after another, the three of them took down the previously stained wood, and this not-so-secret operation gradually caught the attention of someone.
0:2:32|0:2:46|In another office, a mysterious person is tapping on the table, deep in thought. After some hesitation, he picks up the phone and dials 110. Meanwhile, three people are leisurely loading the felled wood onto a van.
0:2:51|0:3:8|After finishing loading the car, they did not leave immediately, but rested in place. What they didn't know was that the police department had responded promptly to the report and was driving quickly to the scene. At this moment, the three of them, unaware of the situation, were leisurely resting in place.
0:3:35|0:3:40|[Ding Shun] that guy, bought a batch of wood from Manzhouli and just left it there without moving it.
0:3:46|0:3:53|If he can't get enough quality wood from outside, he will process the internal memory, and the production won't stop at all.
0:4:40|0:4:56|After playing around for a while, the three of them walked towards the car parked on the side of the road. It was a large jeep with plenty of space for things. The three of them, carrying the freshly cut wood, drove off in the car. They had no awareness of the consequences they were about to face.
0:4:56|0:5:6|At the same time, outside the office, a man is carefully examining a photo. The photo shows a pretty girl, and the man looks at it with a lecherous smile.
0:5:7|0:5:14|At this moment, the three people who escaped from the scene are still driving away. Suddenly, they spot the police on the road.
0:5:18|0:5:21|The crowd rubbed their eyes and took a closer look.
0:5:41|0:5:44|The car screeched to a sudden stop, and [Yang Tianfang] said to his friend.
0:5:55|0:6:11|The two friends left first, leaving [Yang Tianfang] to continue driving alone. Before the car had gone far, they encountered the police coming towards them. [Yang Tianfang] accelerated past the police car, and the police noticed something was wrong and turned around to chase after them.
0:6:11|0:6:25|The two cars raced one after the other on this narrow country road, the intense chase breaking through the bottleneck of the forest. Under the pursuit of the police, [Yang Tianfang] was finally captured. Afterwards, his girlfriend [Tan Qing] and mother received the news of [Yang Tianfang]'s arrest.
0:6:29|0:6:33|[Tan Qing] took the notification letter and examined it carefully.
0:6:52|0:7:7|After settling [Yang Tianfang]'s mother, she set out to find an acquaintance for help. [Tan Qing] arrived at a run-down factory that seemed poorly managed and desolate. However, inside the factory was a finely decorated office, creating a strong contrast between the two.
0:7:9|0:7:29|[Tan Qing] hesitated at the door for a long time, but finally made up his mind to walk in. The so-called acquaintance inside was none other than the factory director [Ding Shun], who had been pestering him for years. [Ding Shun] arranged for [Tan Qing] to sit down.
0:7:30|0:7:38|[Tan Qing] sat down slowly, looking a bit awkward and constrained. [Ding Shun] brought over a glass of water, handing it to him with a smile on his face.
0:7:51|0:7:54|Upon hearing this number, he appeared somewhat hesitant.
0:8:11|0:8:30|Upon hearing that it was for the old lady's medical treatment, he immediately changed his attitude and prepared to withdraw money. At this moment, [Tan Qing] was also very embarrassed, lying was not good, but at least he managed to borrow the money. After [Tan Qing] left the factory, he went to the police station to pay the fine. The police officer took the receipt, checked the information, and confirmed it.
0:8:32|0:8:45|After understanding the basic situation, the police officers began to fill out the form for the fine payment. The whole process was handled efficiently, just requiring basic information to be filled out and confirmed before taking the form to the bank for the fine payment.
0:8:50|0:9:5|After leaving the police station, [Tan Qing] looked at the fine ticket with a serious expression. It was for himself that [Yang Tianfang] took the risk to steal from the neighbor's tomb. And now, this money seemed to have become his own debt. He also had to consider how to face [Ding Shun] in the future.
0:9:5|0:9:9|After paying the fine and undergoing educational reform, [Yang Tianfang] was finally released.
0:9:11|0:9:25|He went to the mountains with [Tan Qing] to relax and relieve some recent worries. The two of them chatted and laughed along the way, creating a relaxed atmosphere. During the conversation, [Su Lin] mentioned wanting to work outside to ease the financial pressure at home.
0:9:35|0:9:39|[Yang Tianfang] turned around and looked at his beloved girlfriend, [Tan Qing], saying gently.
0:9:43|0:9:59|Tan Qing, Yang Tianfang gently kissed Tan Qing's forehead, then the two embraced each other, with Tan Qing leaning on Yang Tianfang's shoulder. After speaking, they looked at each other and smiled happily.
0:10:0|0:10:16|The setting sun behind them outlined their figures, as if blessing this couple with mutual affection. As the sun sets in the west, its rays also spread over the city below the mountain. [Yang Tianfang] resolutely left the land that nurtured him, as well as his closest companion.
0:10:22|0:10:40|Time flies, it has been several years since [Tan Qing] went out to work. For various reasons, [Tan Qing] may have not been in contact with his mother and girlfriend for a long time. At this moment, a train slowly pulls into the platform, and waiting outside to greet it are the two brothers who went to the neighbor's house with [Tan Qing] before.
0:10:40|0:10:49|They kept sweeping the inside of the car on the platform, waiting for the train to slowly come to a stop. Just then, they saw [Yang Tianfang] standing by the door ready to get off early.
0:10:53|0:11:8|The crowd took the heavy luggage from [Tan Qing]'s hands. At this moment, they noticed the woman who was traveling with [Tan Qing]. [Tan Qing] looked at Tang Xiaojuan and awkwardly smiled.
0:11:35|0:11:39|Friends helped [Yang Tianfang] carry his luggage, preparing to welcome him and clean up, and they arrived at the restaurant.
0:11:43|0:12:0|Long time no see, everyone ordered a table of dishes and sat around it. They all raised their glasses and drank heartily.
0:12:40|0:12:44|Another round of drinks down, but the conversation at the table always seems to be hiding something.
0:13:10|0:13:24|Upon hearing this, [Yang Tianfang]'s face immediately changed. The atmosphere became awkward in an instant, and everyone looked at each other helplessly.
0:13:30|0:13:45|In the middle of the night, [Tan Qing] couldn't fall asleep no matter what. Even after so many years, he still always recalls various things that happened in the past at night. Helplessly, he can only sit up and struggle through this cold night.
0:13:45|0:14:3|Gradually, his thoughts drifted back to the time when [Yang Tianfang] had just left for another place, leaving him alone and helpless in his hometown. At the same time, his mother passed away due to illness, plunging [Tan Qing] into immense sorrow. He spent his days in tears, barely getting by with the help of [Ding Shun].
0:14:20|0:14:32|[Tan Qing] watched as his father turned around and placed the portrait on the table. After wiping away his tears, he turned to [Su Lin] sitting behind him and said.
0:15:16|0:15:19|[Tan Qing] writes letters to [Yang Tianfang] whenever she has time.
0:15:39|0:15:49|Even so, [Yang Tianfang] has never responded to [Tan Qing]'s yearning. Perhaps it's because of his busy work schedule, or perhaps it's due to the long-term separation, the feelings between the two gradually faded.
0:15:51|0:16:6|[Yang Tianfang] went for a walk by the river alone after the drinking session dispersed. On this quiet and chilly night, he leaned on the bridge and gazed at the cold and calm river. Faced with his feelings towards [Tan Qing], his heart was filled with resentment and dissatisfaction.
0:16:7|0:16:24|After this reunion with an old friend, he recalled the past memories and the unexpected development of their relationship. In the dense forest outside the city, there was a thatched hut where [Yang Tianfang]'s father often stayed, as if isolated from the world.
0:16:24|0:16:31|As soon as the day broke, Tan Qing's father woke up. He quickly tidied up and grabbed a few necessary items before heading out.
0:16:32|0:16:49|Outside the door, there are many saplings piled up, which has been the persistent career of the father for many years. He bent down and lifted a small sapling, then walked towards the depths of the forest, leaving behind an aging yet very resolute figure. [Yang Tianfang], who has not been home for many years, is now planning to find his father in the woods.
0:16:50|0:16:57|The rugged mountain road and lush vegetation made it difficult for [Yang Tianfang] to walk, he had to stop and catch his breath after just a few steps.
0:17:1|0:17:4|After taking a break, he regained his energy and continued to move forward.
0:17:14|0:17:28|Not long after, [Yang Tianfang] found the thatched cottage where his father lived. He lifted the door curtain and looked inside, but did not see his father. Just as he looked around in confusion, he finally saw that busy figure on the mountainside.
0:17:28|0:17:33|Seeing this situation, [Yang Tianfang] smiled knowingly and quickly picked up the shovel next to him to follow.
0:17:34|0:17:39|Years of not seeing his father, the longing pushed him to run all the way.
0:17:44|0:17:49|After planting the sapling, the father looked up and saw his son walking towards him from a distance.
0:18:8|0:18:12|Tan Qing and Su Lin sat down in place and started to talk.
0:18:41|0:18:45|Upon hearing his father's words, [Yang Tianfang] immediately showed a look of difficulty.
0:19:12|0:19:32|The father didn't understand his feelings, [Tan Qing] could only sigh and look into the distance helplessly. When he got home, [Tan Qing] was chopping wood in the yard. Taking the gift, [Tan Qing] led the guests into the house.
0:20:32|0:20:34|[Tan Qing] and [Su Lin] are outside the house with their friends.
0:21:25|0:21:27|Tan Qing also joined the two of them.
0:23:27|0:23:29|Su Lin finds Juanhua after leaving.
0:23:48|0:24:5|Listen, [Su Lin] turned around and left. Although she was leaving, she kept looking back every three steps, prompting Juanhua to urge her on. The next day, [Yang Tianfang], [Su Lin], and Tang Xiaojuan went to the city together. As they walked down the street, they chatted about some things in their respective lives.
0:24:10|0:24:13|Three of them stopped by a stone stele.
0:24:19|0:24:29|[Yang Tianfang] watched absentmindedly on the side. [Ding Shun] pushed the door open and returned home. At this time, [Tan Qing] had already married [Ding Shun] and they had a son together.
0:25:27|0:25:44|After speaking, [Tan Qing] dragged her son away on her own. At this moment, a competition was taking place on the riverbank. This lake is an artificial lake, and in the winter, the lakefront will become the testing ground for the chassis of the German Dr. Group's cars.
0:26:13|0:26:17|After hanging up the phone, [Yang Tianfang] and his group continued to stroll around the streets.
0:26:34|0:26:37|[Tan Qing] and [Su Lin] made the scene very awkward.
0:26:55|0:27:3|Upon hearing [Yang Tianfang]'s words, [Tan Qing] didn't know how to refute and could only lower her head.
0:27:4|0:27:32|Tan Qing remained silent, creating an awkward atmosphere where no one knew what to say. The words spoken only added to the awkwardness of the situation. At that moment, Yang Tianfang's phone suddenly rang, and he answered it smoothly.
0:27:41|0:27:48|Su Lin chased after Yang Tianfang, leaving Tan Qing standing still. The rest of the people discussed for a moment before heading to the tavern.
0:28:33|0:28:37|[Bat'er] didn't listen to advice, and everyone had no choice but to let him do as he pleased.
0:29:5|0:29:8|The group gathered in the office to discuss.
0:29:20|0:29:22|Tan Qing nodded repeatedly after listening.
0:29:41|0:29:43|[Yang Tianfang] and [Tang Xiaojuan] exchanged a smile.
0:30:12|0:30:17|Back home, [Yang Tianfang] sat down with his parents to have dinner.
0:31:27|0:31:36|The father's words made [Yang Tianfang] lost in thought, not knowing how to deal with his father, so he could only lower his head and continue eating. The next day, he discussed with his friends.
0:32:21|0:32:24|Everyone is very satisfied with [Tan Qing].
0:33:11|0:33:19|[Ba Teer] and his wife had a very unpleasant conversation, each with their own opinions about starting a business. Meanwhile, [Yang Tianfang] and Tang Xiaojuan were chatting on the bridge.
0:34:16|0:34:27|As they were talking, a person walked across the bridge. They turned around and made eye contact with the person. Tan Qing's face instantly darkened.
0:34:40|0:34:59|[Yang Tianfang] was still full of anger about this. In the evening, [Ding Shun] returned home reeking of alcohol.
0:35:6|0:35:23|Seeing her husband passed out drunk again, [Tan Qing] helplessly sat up from the bed. It seemed she had lost count of how many times she had gotten angry about this, gradually feeling drained. After sighing, she got out of bed and walked into the kitchen, poured a glass of water and placed it in front of her intoxicated husband.
0:35:34|0:35:44|[Tan Qing] now only thought he was drunk, with no intention to argue, gave him a disdainful look and turned his head away. After finishing the water, [Ding Shun] put down the cup and lay down again.
0:36:14|0:36:23|[Ding Shun] was indifferent to this and fell asleep. Seeing her husband finally calm down, [Tan Qing] also turned over and went to sleep. The next day, [Yang Tianfang] and his friends discussed together.
0:36:30|0:36:33|[Batuer] put a lot of effort into the project.
0:37:4|0:37:8|[Su Lin] went there, closed his mouth, and turned around.
0:38:24|0:38:29|After implementing the plan for a period of time, [Tan Qing] and [Su Lin] have achieved some success.
0:38:56|0:39:1|[Su Lin] got up and left, while at the same time, in a restaurant, [Ding Shun] was having dinner with a group of friends.
0:39:10|0:39:14|The crowd raised their glasses, clinked them together, and then all drank up.
0:40:29|0:40:31|After a moment of contemplation, [Tan Qing] said to her friend.
0:41:2|0:41:8|Upon hearing his friend's statement, [Ding Shun] appeared very happy. After listening to the introduction of Guiyuan from [Tan Qing], he took the phone.
0:41:24|0:41:49|On the other side, [Su Lin] had an accident while working at the construction site. Upon hearing the news, the two immediately headed to the scene. Assistant Zhang, leading the way, pushed [Su Lin] aside.
0:41:53|0:41:57|Assistant Zhang did not give [Su Lin] a good look. He looked puzzled and pondered for a while.
0:42:32|0:42:49|The incident happened suddenly, and [Batel] immediately thought of going to find the mayor after learning the news. The project, which was progressing smoothly, encountered a setback, causing the two to panic. The excavator mercilessly destroyed the newly built factory building, with countless bricks and stones piled up on the ground like small mountains, undoing days of hard work in an instant.
0:42:49|0:42:51|[Bat'er] knocked on the mayor's door, but there was no response.
0:43:2|0:43:11|Seeking help from the mayor for Wei Guo, [Batel] could only temporarily return to his own home. That day, while [Batel] was sorting through documents at home, someone rang the doorbell.
0:43:13|0:43:18|He put down the documents in his hand and got up to open the door. Outside the door was a familiar face.
0:44:37|0:44:41|After Tan Qing left, Batel's wife started talking again.
0:45:3|0:45:19|In another office, Assistant Zhang put down his work with a helpless look on his face and took the application. He glanced through it disinterestedly and then said to [Su Lin] standing beside him. [Su Lin] looked puzzled.
0:45:48|0:46:14|Assistant Zhang returned the application, leaving [Su Lin] no choice but to turn around and leave in resignation. Inside [Bartle]'s office, after hanging up the phone, Bartle's wife, Sichen, walked over.
0:46:44|0:46:53|Siqing smoothed her hair and left the office. At this time, [Yang Tianfang] also returned from out of town.
0:48:7|0:48:17|[Bat'er] listened, took out the previous phone from behind. [Yang Tianfang] couldn't help but smile. [Su Lin] winked. The two looked at each other and smiled.
0:48:36|0:48:43|[Yang Tianfang]'s face changed, hearing this name, he immediately put his phone back.
0:49:15|0:49:29|[Yang Tianfang] was furious upon hearing the news, but his hostility towards [Tan Qing] also lessened a bit, and the conflict between the two could be resolved more easily when discussed openly. On a beautiful riverbank, [Ding Shun] was camping with a few of his friends.
0:49:29|0:49:44|He stood up, took off his coat, and put on waterproof clothing to prepare for fishing in the river. He picked up the pre-prepared fishing net, spread it out neatly on the surface of the river, and waited quietly. At this moment, Assistant Zhang on the shore shouted to him.
0:49:55|0:49:59|[Ding Shun] was not impressed by this, chuckled and went back to work, while Assistant Zhang invited everyone to have some fish.
0:50:10|0:50:13|Assistant Zhang didn't care about it. [Tan Qing] was hanging out with friends at this time.
0:50:50|0:50:52|[Tan Qing] sighed helplessly.
0:51:2|0:51:18|[Su Lin] and [Battelle] learned their lesson from this setback and kept it in mind. The next day, while [Yang Tianfang] was studying at home, [Tan Qing] suddenly paid a visit. After hesitating for a moment, [Tan Qing] finally spoke up. Upon hearing this voice, [Yang Tianfang] was first stunned, then slowly turned around.
0:51:23|0:51:30|[Yang Tianfang]'s attitude towards [Tan Qing] has softened a lot at this moment. He stands up and turns his back to [Tan Qing].
0:51:31|0:51:37|Hearing Tan Qing following behind, she could only turn around and sit on the bed, still deliberately avoiding Tan Qing's gaze.
0:51:43|0:51:54|She took a deep breath and continued speaking. [Yang Tianfang] heard it and turned to look at [Tan Qing].
0:51:59|0:52:8|When it comes to the favor you showed me back then, Tan Qing, Yang Tianfang stood up slowly. Hearing this, Su Lin, with tears in her eyes, pursed her lips.
0:52:31|0:52:37|[Tan Qing] was now in tears. [Yang Tianfang] continued speaking.
0:52:54|0:53:7|At this moment, Tang Xiaojuan also walked in, and [Tan Qing] couldn't hold back anymore, starting to cry uncontrollably. Unable to keep [Tan Qing] from running away, Tang Xiaojuan could only turn around and start comforting [Yang Tianfang].
0:53:7|0:53:14|[Yang Tianfang] looked up, trying hard to suppress his emotions. When he heard Tang Xiaojuan approaching, he turned his head and bent down to sit on the sofa.
0:53:17|0:53:25|[Yang Tianfang] still turned his back and remained silent. After some persuasion from Tang Xiaojuan, [Yang Tianfang] seemed to have some peace of mind. The next day, he went to see Mayor Zhu for inquiries.
0:54:22|0:54:31|After a conversation with the mayor, [Yang Tianfang] gained confidence. [Bartel] and Tang Xiaojuan were discussing with [Yang Tianfang] at the restaurant when Bartel's phone rang.
0:54:34|0:54:52|Siqin is very worried about [Bartle]. The couple do not trust each other, and their conflicts are becoming more apparent. [Bartle] puts down his phone. He also knows in his heart that what [Tan Qing] said makes sense.
0:55:18|0:55:37|[Su Lin] turned to chase Xiao Juan, while [Tan Qing] turned and left. This is how [Tan Qing] and Siqin often are, temporarily setting aside their conflicts. With the permission of Mayor Zhu, the beverage factory project is progressing rapidly. Everyone has clear division of labor, and the efficiency is considerable.
0:55:37|0:55:49|[Batuer] and [Su Lin] are supervising the construction site, while [Yang Tianfang] is running around to make connections, paving the way for the opening of the beverage factory. After coming out of the office, [Yang Tianfang] heaved a sigh of relief, as if everything was finally falling into place.
0:55:49|0:55:55|In a hospital, [Tan Qing] is taking care of her sick son, while Tang Xiaojuan also comes to visit.
0:56:35|0:56:39|[Tan Qing] couldn't believe it for a moment.
0:56:45|0:56:55|It turns out that [Tan Qing] has been misunderstanding the relationship between Tang Xiaojuan and [Yang Tianfang]. One night, while resting at the hotel, [Yang Tianfang] received a call from [Tan Qing].
0:57:26|0:57:29|The two have now resolved their past grievances.
0:58:9|0:58:13|Faced with Tan Qing's kindness, Yang Tianfang hesitated for a moment, not knowing what to say.
0:58:23|0:58:40|[Tan Qing] sincerely wanted to help [Yang Tianfang], but he also acted within his means. He did not deplete his savings for this cause, avoiding financial difficulties. Later on, he often took his son to the science museum for shows, and their lives were not affected by this.
0:58:41|0:58:59|[Su Lin] When the three of them were discussing engineering matters, Siqin always called in, but [Bartle] hung up every time and ignored her. Although [Yang Tianfang] noticed something was wrong, he felt awkward to meddle in his friend's family affairs, so he pretended nothing had happened and continued discussing the matters at hand.
0:58:59|0:59:3|[Su Lin] and [Battelle] walked into [Yang Tianfang]'s office and gathered together to discuss.
1:0:22|1:0:29|Su Lin gestured in agreement, while Tan Qing sat in the office with a worried look on her face, staring at the computer screen.
1:0:46|1:1:2|In this matter of running the beverage factory, he was also busy and worked hard, not only taking care of his own work over there, but also feeling the pressure from both sides, which made him anxious. In terms of the company, he also tried his best to make connections and facilitate more investments for [Yang Tianfang]'s beverage factory.
1:1:3|1:1:19|Even so, [Tan Qing]'s wife, Siqin, always stares at herself, misunderstanding her relationship with [Tan Qing], causing her to lose face in front of her friends. All these things weigh heavily on Tang Xiaojuan, making her breathless and frowning all day long. She can only digest it herself.
1:1:19|1:1:23|And at this moment in [Tan Qing]'s home, [Ding Shun] is in the yard drying fishing nets.
1:1:25|1:1:30|Upon hearing this, [Tan Qing] walked out of the kitchen with a basin and questioned [Ding Shun].
1:1:54|1:2:0|[Tan Qing] threw the fishing line to him, and [Ding Shun] picked up the fishing line. Inside the train station.
1:2:53|1:3:8|Su Lin took out a wooden carving from the bag on the side. As the train started moving, Tan Xiaojuan returned to the company, with Yang Tianfang accompanying the mayor to visit the site.
1:3:19|1:3:25|At the same time, on a river bank, [Ding Shun] is running ashore in a hurry, needing to use the restroom. Assistant Zhang speaks at this moment.
1:3:51|1:3:57|[Ding Shun], after changing clothes, hurriedly took out a tissue from his bag and clenched it in his hand, then turned and ran towards the distant woods.
1:4:3|1:4:20|The people who were barbecuing watched as [Tan Qing] walked away, planning to take a break and play cards before continuing preparations when [Tan Qing] returned. At this moment, in a panic, [Tan Qing] ran into the woods and found a secluded spot to crouch down. Little did he know, the old woods were full of dangers.
1:4:20|1:4:30|While Tan Qing was relieving himself in peace, he suddenly heard something unusual behind him. With a look of horror on his face, he saw a huge and ferocious bear rushing out from behind. In the end, Tan Qing was either killed or injured in the attack.
1:4:34|1:4:43|[Yang Tianfang] welcomed Siqin and [Bartle] in the office. After Siqin sat down, [Siqiu] looked around and spoke.
1:4:47|1:4:49|Siqin listens to her father, glaring at [Bartle].
1:5:32|1:5:37|Since receiving the gold chain and implementing the Tianbao Project, there have been more wild animals.
1:5:58|1:6:0|In the hospital, [Ding Shun] is lying on the bed.
1:6:5|1:6:8|Yang Tianfang and his group came to visit Ding Shun.
1:6:25|1:6:31|[Su Lin] takes the money from [Tan Qing]. In response, [Tan Qing] doesn't refuse too much and can only accept it.
1:6:34|1:6:39|In the old farm, [Yang Tianfang] and a group of friends who grew up together gathered together.
1:7:4|1:7:11|Juanhua smiled and looked up at Siqin, everyone was very happy about it. [Yang Tianfang] and Siqin discussed the matter of setting up a factory in their hometown.
1:7:21|1:7:35|Tan Qing took out a passbook from her pocket. Batel took it from Tan Qing and handed it to Yang Tianfang. Faced with such a generous gift, Yang Tianfang could only express his thanks repeatedly.
1:8:7|1:8:11|In the office, [Yang Tianfang] received a phone call. He received a response over the phone.
1:8:22|1:8:40|After hanging up the phone, [Yang Tianfang] began to busy himself, and later went to visit [Ding Shun] specifically. Putting down the gift in his hand, [Yang Tianfang] looked at [Ding Shun] lying on the hospital bed with a worried expression.
1:8:40|1:8:54|[Tan Qing] arranged for [Yang Tianfang] and [Su Lin] to sit by the bed, looking at [Ding Shun] who had no reaction and couldn't move, sighed and said slowly. [Ding Shun] struggled to open his eyes, for Niu Niu, and also for [Tan Qing].
1:9:3|1:9:17|Seeing his former enemy putting in so much effort to help him, [Ding Shun] was deeply moved. He slowly reached out his hand, which was also grasped by [Yang Tianfang]. At this moment, all the conflicts between them had been completely resolved, leaving only mutual respect.
1:9:21|1:9:33|[Ding Shun] heard what [Yang Tianfang] said, tears welled up in his eyes. At the same time, he felt ashamed for his previous misdeeds towards [Yang Tianfang]. [Tan Qing] was also moved by the scene, standing aside trying hard to hold back tears.
1:9:33|1:9:45|Although Tan Qing used to dislike Su Lin, all the past conflicts have been resolved now. Everything has improved, and Siqin has also started working at the beverage factory to ensure the quality of the products.
1:9:46|1:9:54|Although the beverage factory appeared to be thriving on the surface, there were actually hidden undercurrents. Before long, the police came knocking on the door. The police officer took out a beverage.
1:10:15|1:10:19|[Tan Qing] witnessed, and quickly pushed aside the excited [Su Lin].
1:10:41|1:11:0|After seeing off [Su Lin], [Yang Tianfang] continued to discuss with the police. In the end, there was no way to resist, the huge wind on the door also sealed the enthusiasm of everyone for entrepreneurship.
1:11:9|1:11:19|Batel said to [Su Lin]. It's no use being anxious, at this moment the three of them fell into silence.
1:12:3|1:12:24|Everyone stood up to toast and drank up their glasses. After some pleasantries, everyone sat down. However, at this moment, [Ding Shun] filled the glasses with wine, stood up and said. Now he was no longer as carefree as before, even a little shy. After a moment of contemplation, he spoke with a calm expression.
1:12:57|1:13:18|Hearing this, [Yang Tianfang] sitting next to them also stood up, wanting to express his gratitude in a thousand words. The banquet ended, and soon came the day when the field was reduced to a desolate state.
1:14:56|1:15:6|In the applause of the crowd, the beverage factory opened smoothly, leasing and donating beverages for external sales. During the sales process, they received positive feedback.
1:15:21|1:15:37|Receiving a disdainful look from Juanhua, [Su Lin] could only keep quiet and the two of them then started the car, leaving the mountain where drinks were being sold. The sales of the beverage factory had unexpectedly been doing well during this period, with many large orders. [Yang Tianfang] sat in the office at all times, smiling as he contacted the merchants.
1:16:3|1:16:10|Just finished dealing with an order, and his phone rang again. Glancing at the caller ID, [Yang Tianfang] answered the call.
1:16:21|1:16:32|After hanging up the phone, he stretched lazily to loosen his stiff limbs, and then plunged back into his intense work. In the factory at this moment, bottles of drinks were neatly arranged on the assembly line.
1:16:59|1:17:3|After introducing each other, everyone took their seats, and [Yang Tianfang] stood up to give a speech.
1:17:27|1:17:40|Amidst the enthusiastic applause, [Tan Qing] stood up and solemnly spoke. Then, [Tan Qing] reached for the drink on the table and continued talking. Hearing this, everyone's faces lit up with joy.
1:18:3|1:18:10|Upon receiving the news, the whole audience erupted into applause. After Zhang Guang took his seat, [Yang Tianfang] took over the topic and continued speaking.
1:18:25|1:18:40|Zhang Guang also stood up at this time, clinked glasses with [Yang Tianfang], and nodded in agreement. Another round of toasts was made, and the atmosphere at the table gradually became more lively. After sitting back down, Zhang Guang picked up the wine on the table and spoke to everyone.
1:19:41|1:19:59|The crowd raised their glasses again, thanking Zhang Guang for his support to the beverage factory. After the meal, [Yang Tianfang] and his group took Zhang Guang to visit the production line of the beverage factory. [Yang Tianfang] gave detailed explanations about the current output efficiency and hygiene conditions, and Zhang Guang was very satisfied during the visit, nodding frequently.
1:19:59|1:20:16|After this visit, [Zhang Guang] was completely reassured about the attractions at Lama Mountain. After the visit, the group went to Lama Mountain again, where [Yang Tianfang] grew up. He showed [Zhang Guang] the stunning natural scenery here and also experienced the unique ecological environment of Lama Mountain.
1:20:21|1:20:36|They continued on their way, enjoying the scenery along the way while listening to [Yang Tianfang]'s explanations. Time passed quickly, and the group unknowingly arrived at the foot of the main peak of Lama Mountain. At this moment, [Yang Tianfang] stopped in his tracks, turned around, and said to [Zhang Guang].
1:20:48|1:20:51|[Zhang Guang] nodded and continued to climb up.
1:21:2|1:21:12|The towering peaks rose into the clouds, with a unique shape. The group continued to move forward, and soon arrived at a large forest halfway up the mountain.
1:21:19|1:21:36|The crowd lowered their bodies, passed through a narrow passage, reached the mountaintop, and what awaited them was a breathtaking view, overlooking all the other mountains. Tan Qing's creative journey, just like this long climb, although the road ahead is full of difficulties and obstacles, after enduring hardships, they will eventually reach the summit.
