0:2:33|0:2:40|The man who was wearing a white headscarf and holding a microphone wrapped in red cloth said these words. The surroundings quieted down as he walked through the snow and lifted the door curtain to enter the house.
0:2:59|0:3:13|The snow on the ground has been swept away, a pair of wrapped-up little feet, leaning on a cane, walking slowly. The grandmother has a scarf on her head, holding a scarf around her neck to protect her face, finally reaching the front of the house. Following behind is a younger aunt who helps her open the door.
0:3:13|0:3:23|Through the glass window, you can see the old lady who entered the room sitting on the heated brick bed, taking out a pack of medicine from the medicine box. This old lady is named [Zhang Xiantu], born in 1926 and passed away in 2015.
0:3:23|0:3:37|She scooped out some pills and put the rest back into the pill box, then picked up a small medicine bottle, unscrewed the cap and poured it into her palm. After pouring it several times without seeing anything, it seemed that the bottle was empty. The old lady looked at the bottle, then put the pills in her palm into her mouth.
0:3:37|0:3:49|She, who is getting older, pursed her lips and swallowed, then poured out the medicine bottle and wanted to see if there was any medicine. The scene switched to two side-by-side photos, the old man on the left holding a cigarette sitting in front of the house, and the old lady on the right in a close-up photo.
0:3:49|0:4:4|The scene cuts to the old lady sitting on the kang in the room. Her name is [Li Xiumei], born in 1928 and passed away in 2014. Her mouth opened a few times but no sound came out. She looked outside the window, then at herself, and her gaze turned back to the window again.
0:4:4|0:4:13|Through the reflection, we can see [Li Xiumei] sitting on the kang, the second hand of the old clock on the wall moving slowly. The screen gradually darkens, and a piece of text appears.
0:4:13|0:4:28|During the 8 years of the Japanese invasion of China, a total of 200,000 Chinese women were forced to serve as comfort women for the Japanese army. Most of the women were either brutally killed or could not bear the humiliation and committed suicide, with only a small number surviving. The text gradually fades away.
0:4:28|0:4:47|The scene shifts to Jingui Village in Meng County, Shanxi Province, where the dilapidated houses are piled with wire mesh at the door. Apart from trees, there are also trenches around. The low wooden door is half open, with only a corner of the painting left on it. Through the gate, you can see a tree surrounded by stones in the courtyard, with a cave dwelling behind it.
0:5:58|0:6:8|From a high angle overlooking this former comfort station, it is now covered with trees and weeds. Inside a cave dwelling, the whole room is very dark due to the lack of light.
0:6:32|0:6:46|Her name is [Pian Huanying], born in 1928. In the dim cave, she moved her cheeks slightly, swaying her body silently. The scene shifts to another room, where a man in a striped shirt pours water into a basin and then walks out.
0:6:46|0:7:2|Sitting on the kang is an old lady with white hair, next to her is a radio. The old lady is sitting along the edge of the kang, holding a book in one hand, rubbing her eyes with the other hand, then putting it down and turning a page of the book. Her name is [Hao Juxiang], born in 1922 and passed away in 2016.
0:7:2|0:7:20|A head full of white hair is styled with an old-fashioned hairpin, sitting quietly with the head lowered. The camera shifts to a chopping board, where a pair of strong hands is cutting noodles with a knife. The chopping board is placed on the edge of the heated brick bed, next to the wall, with a pot already on fire. There is also an old lady sitting cross-legged on the brick bed, supporting one leg.
0:7:21|0:7:35|An arm rested on the folded blanket, head bowed, fiddling with the paper in hand. She is called [Wei Shaolan], born in 1931 and passed away in 2016. Due to her old age, she could see the green hands repeatedly folding the paper, creating creases and smoothing them out.
0:7:36|0:7:52|The scene shifts to another room, where a middle-aged woman is removing the small chairs used as a table from the kang. She drags the chairs with four fingers while holding two bowls with her thumbs, then walks out of the room. The elderly lady who just finished eating on the kang is called [Zhao Lanying], born in 1925 and passed away in 2016.
0:7:52|0:8:6|She sat cross-legged with one hand on her leg and the other propped on the heated brick bed, still chewing. On the windowsill of another house, medicine bottles were neatly arranged from low to high, and the old lady on the heated brick bed was covered with a thin quilt, leaning to the side while adjusting the pillow.
0:8:6|0:8:23|After tidying up, she pulled up the thin blanket and covered herself, placing one hand on her forehead and closing her eyes. She is called [Liu Gailian], born in 1925. The old lady's nasal breathing sound accompanied the rise and fall of her body. The scene shifted to outside a house, where a sparrow flew by in the air.
0:8:23|0:8:39|The old lady living here is called [Liu Fenghai], born in 1924 and passed away in 2017. There are two stacks of bricks and some firewood piled up at the door. The old lady lives with her second son and daughter-in-law. She is afraid that her experiences will bring trouble to their lives, so she does not want to appear on the screen.
0:8:39|0:8:46|The text fades away, and the camera turns to a cave dwelling. The walls inside the cave are painted white, the door is new, and there is even a curtain added to it.
0:8:46|0:9:1|An old lady sat by the kang drinking water from a cup. She is called [Cao Heimao], born in 1922. Due to her old age, her eyes are sunken and her mouth is drawn in. Although her forehead is covered with wrinkles, you can still see a fingernail-sized dent.
0:9:1|0:9:17|Outside the house at this moment, a South Korean photographer arrived with two people. The three walked through the courtyard and went straight to the front of the cave dwelling. The South Korean photographer opened the door curtain and walked in, heading straight to [Cao Heimao] who was still on the kang inside the cave. He sat on the edge of the kang, and [Cao Heimao] handed him a cigarette. The interpreter said to [Cao Heimao]:
0:9:42|0:9:50|Saying that, [Cao Heimao] lit a fire for the Korean photographer, who exhaled a puff of smoke because he couldn't understand Grandma's words.
0:10:12|0:10:17|Grandma looked at the camera and asked if it could be used, wanting the photographer to see if it was different. Then, she showed him the photo on her ID card.
0:10:18|0:10:27|Let the photographer see if he can take a picture. The photographer held a photo in one hand and a camera in the other, and pressed the shutter a few times towards [Grandma Cao Black Hair].
0:10:36|0:10:40|Pointing at the camera, [Ma Dongmei] asked the photographer, "This thing is amazing, right? It can capture everything."
0:10:42|0:10:49|The photographer could only nod in agreement as he couldn't understand what his grandmother was saying. The Korean photographer, named [An Shihong], said,
0:11:9|0:11:14|The scene shifts to the Dongning County Social Welfare Home in Mudanjiang City, Heilongjiang Province. [An Shihong] continues to speak.
0:11:42|0:11:55|So he came to visit these grandmothers. One of the grandmothers in the scene is holding a fake baby. He is called [Li Fengyun], born in 1922 and passed away in 2016. His original name was Li Shouduan, a Korean. [An Shihong] continued to say, especially in China, is the country that has suffered the most aggression.
0:13:16|0:13:30|The wall has obviously been painted, with dolls dressed in Korean clothing and a map of Korea on the wall. Outside the door, an auntie is washing clothes in a basin.
0:13:51|0:14:0|The narrator is the adopted daughter of [Park Chul-soon], sitting on a bench with her family eating by the cement road outside Grandma [Park Chul-soon]'s house.
0:14:6|0:14:9|The neighbor's child is playing in front of the door by himself.
0:14:10|0:14:20|The narrator's child is on the other side of the door, sitting on a small stool playing with a phone. The mother brings food to her mouth, while the narrator watches her and talks to her.
0:14:24|0:14:36|Park Chul-soon's grandmother walked slowly into the courtyard with her hands behind her back. She stepped up the stairs, pushed aside the blue door curtain at the entrance, and entered the house.
0:14:40|0:14:48|She is now called [Mao Yinmei], born in 1922 and passed away in 2017. Her original name was Park Cheshun, a Korean.
0:15:11|0:15:18|In Grandma Mao Yinmei's room, there are fake flowers prominently displayed, as well as dolls dressed in Korean costumes.
0:17:16|0:17:23|Grandma leaned against the cabinet, recounting stories from her childhood.
0:18:42|0:18:57|From Grandma Mao Yinmei's house, you can see an old man walking towards it. He stops in front of the house, looks at the vegetable garden in front, bends down to touch it with his hands, then hunches his back, lowers his head, and steps to the side to inspect it.
0:18:58|0:19:12|On the road in front of the steps, a person rode a motorcycle past, with a pair of legs and a bucket of water appearing in front of the camera. It was [Ma Yinmei], Grandma Mao's adopted daughter, returning. She tightly held the rope and carried the shoulder pole into the house.
0:20:10|0:20:30|[Ma Dongmei]'s adopted daughter is named [Huang Meirong]. After she cooked the dishes in the kitchen, the whole family sat around the dining table eating. Grandma Ma Dongmei held a bowl in one hand and picked up a piece of potato with the other hand, chewing slowly.
0:20:33|0:20:57|The scene shifts to Wuhan, Hubei Province, where a wall is marked with the words "Jiqingli No. 1". Above the alleyways, tangled electrical wires hang, with clothes drying outside the windows. In the dim cement corridor, some light filters in through the windows. The sound of a horn collecting recyclables can be heard on the street. This is a city that has been invaded.
0:21:0|0:21:17|From October 25th to 27th, 1938, the Japanese invading army successively occupied [Hankou], [Wuchang], and [Hanyang]. After the fall of [Wuhan], the Japanese army massacred Chinese soldiers and civilians in the three towns of [Wuhan], and quickly established more than 20 different types of comfort stations.
0:21:23|0:21:34|Looking up at the top of [Jiqingli], the bright sunlight makes the alley appear even darker. The scene shifts to the sky above [Jiqingli], in front of a tall building, a low building with a yellow roof.
0:21:34|0:21:49|[Hankou Jiqingli] This Japanese comfort station was the first to open on November 8, 1938, with 9 comfort stations operated by brothel owners from Osaka, Kobe, Hiroshima, and other places in Japan, with about 130 Japanese comfort women.
0:22:2|0:22:18|As an old lane, [Jiqing Lane] has the largest area, and the residential houses still retain the old heavy and mottled wooden doors. Now, this relic burdened with heavy historical memories is quiet and out of place in the bustling modern city center.
0:22:18|0:22:34|The scene returns to the grandmother's house of [Ma Yimei], she is sitting in the inner courtyard, looking down at her wrist, pressing it twice and then letting go, sitting up straight, rubbing her arms. Her eyes look up for a while, then look down at her arms.
0:22:35|0:22:46|Facing the camera, [Mao Yinmei] did not look directly at it, but instead gazed off to the side, with wrinkles already covering her face.
0:22:47|0:22:57|Her mouth was muttering, frowning, and she turned around, saying:
0:23:38|0:23:46|She repeated these welcoming words, focusing on the well-preserved site of the Comfort Station [Jiqingli], where such voices had echoed countless times.
0:23:47|0:24:3|The scene transitions from the dim alley of Jiqingli to a brightly lit house next to it. Even though it's daytime, [Grandma Mao Yimei] is already lying in bed resting, with a radio playing by her side.
0:24:6|0:24:14|When it came to this point, the adopted daughter [Huang Meirong] paused.
0:24:50|0:25:6|At the doorstep, [Ma Yinmei] sat on a chair, supporting her head with her hand. On the other side, her own child and the neighbor's child sat on chairs, with another girl standing beside them. A younger child ran out from the house, and a woman pointed to the steps, telling him to go get some food from the girl standing there.
0:25:6|0:25:21|The child looked at the plastic bag, then ran inside to find the woman who had just left, that is, his mother. His mother stood inside talking to him, while [Ma Yinmei] watched the child running around. The child ran to the plastic bag to get some food.
0:25:21|0:25:37|After pinching a few, he walked towards [Ma Yinmei], saying as he walked, "Here." [Ma Yinmei] initially thought he wanted the toy in her hand, then realized and reached out to catch it, looking to see what it was. She placed the toy on her lap and looked at the food in her hand.
0:25:37|0:25:41|The adopted daughter [Huang Meirong] and her husband came out with food to look for her.
0:26:0|0:26:6|In the inner courtyard, [Mao Yinmei] watches her adopted daughter washing clothes.
0:29:54|0:30:2|[Ma Yinmei] sang the songs "Arirang" and "Bellflower Ballad", both of which are traditional Korean folk songs. The scene shifts to a white building, with the building behind it still under construction.
0:30:4|0:30:26|In the completed building, people have already moved in. Various buckets are piled in front of the building. This is LingShui Li Autonomous County, Hainan Province, with a red cross sign indicating the Central Health Center. The patient's name is written on the IV drip bag in the health center, and the medicine drips slowly. An elderly person lying on the sickbed with one arm on the forehead, looking up at the ceiling.
0:30:26|0:30:42|She is called [Chen Yabian], born in 1927 and passed away in 2017, a member of the Li ethnic group. [Chen Yabian] stared at the ceiling for a while, then closed her eyes to rest. The scene shifted to a forest, which is in Baoting Li and Miao Autonomous County, Hainan Province.
0:30:43|0:30:53|A man walked into the woods and knelt down in front of a tombstone.
0:31:47|0:32:3|The scene shifts to a cement windowsill, through which we can see an elderly person sitting on a simple bed inside the house. She is called [Huang Youliang], born in 1927, a member of the Li ethnic group. The house is built with bricks and cement, without any further decoration.
0:32:3|0:32:11|The wooden single bed is propped up with a bed curtain, and the old woman lies on the bed fanning herself with a straw hat. Her name is [Chen Liancun], born in 1926.
0:32:28|0:32:42|In another house, an old woman is sitting. She is called [Fu Meiju], born in 1928 and passed away in 2017. Outside the house, a man and a woman are busy by the pool, accidentally knocking over a small knife. Hearing the sound, [Fu Meiju] looks around with concern.
0:32:42|0:32:49|On the other side, an old man walked out of the house, holding a stick as a cane in one hand, and wearing a straw hat on the other hand.
0:33:15|0:33:29|The old woman is called [Wang Zhifeng], born in 1928. In a dimly lit room, an old woman with a hunched back slowly moved, reaching the chair at the door and sitting down. Due to her age, she supported herself with a cane in one hand and reached for the chair with the other hand very slowly.
0:33:29|0:33:42|Bend down and sit. He is called [Fu Guiying], born in 1919 and passed away in 2015. In another room, a girl walks on the road, and a woman comes up from below, touching her hair.
0:33:44|0:33:58|The two arrived at a iron gate, this is the home of [Wang Yukai], born in 1920 and passed away in 2014. The woman opened the door and the two walked in.
0:34:21|0:34:29|The girl picked up the notebook on the table and leaned back to read it, while the two of them continued their conversation.
0:35:11|0:35:32|The two sat on the bed, the woman telling the girl about the day [Luo Shanxue] passed away. As she listened, the girl started to cry, and the woman fell silent, reaching up to scratch her back. The girl wiped away her tears with the back of her hand, and the woman put her hand down and said,
0:35:32|0:36:0|The mouth opened and closed before speaking again: The woman turned her head to look at the bed, and the girl couldn't help but cry again, her back shaking. The woman reached out and touched the girl's arm to comfort her.
0:36:11|0:36:20|The girl recalls the day she learned of the death of [Luo Shanxue].
0:36:28|0:36:41|The woman took out a pile of daily necessities, all of which were bought by the girl for [Luo Shanxue]. The girl turned around crying, picked up these unopened items and looked at them. The woman turned around and sat back next to him, the girl turned her face away, wiping her tears on the short sleeves.
0:36:41|0:37:5|The woman picked up a bag and unzipped it, revealing a set of brand new bedding inside. She unfolded the bedsheet, which had a floral pattern on it. The girl also helped to fully spread out the bedsheet.
0:37:32|0:37:48|In the house where [Luo Shanxue] used to live, a girl is narrating what she knows. The scene shifts to Lingshui County, Hainan Province, where a not-so-wide cement road is lined with sparsely planted trees on both sides. The cement road extends to the outside road, with a narrow stream separating the yard from the road.
0:37:49|0:37:54|Vice director of the Nanbao Town Elderly Care Home, [Liang Chaosheng], rode a tricycle into the courtyard.
0:38:23|0:38:46|In the scene, an old woman moves a chair outside and sits down. She is called [Lin Ailan], born in 1925 and passed away in 2015. Through the security bars, you can see the old woman's gray hair with a black headband, as she just exerted some effort to move the chair outside.
0:38:46|0:39:4|Sitting down, she was still breathing rapidly. [Lin Ailan] grandmother's eyes had sunken deeply, she licked her rapidly trembling lips. There was a cool mat on the bed in her room, with two small daggers placed next to the pillow. The fan was spinning towards the door, and the wall on one side was covered with small insects.
0:39:4|0:39:12|Outside the door, [Lin Ailan] grandma slightly leaned her body, with her arms resting on the armrest of the chair, crossing her legs as she sat outside.
0:40:2|0:40:18|In the battle in Haikou, two Japanese devils were killed, with a machine gun hanging on their bodies and a pistol in their hands, both loaded with bullets. The grandmother pointed to the top of her head and said, "There is a hole here. If the bullet grazes past here a little bit, I would have been dead." In the nursing home, a man with bare upper body called someone over to drink.
0:40:48|0:41:0|The seated man extended a hand, gesturing with a palm about that size, not very big, just this small, eating so little, not enough for me to eat. The man with bare arms imitated him, extending a hand and gesturing.
0:41:0|0:41:16|Three cups of wine are not enough for me to drink. Grandmother [Wei Shaolan] smiled at this remark, and the man no longer insisted on drinking more. After that, the man rode away on his bicycle.
0:42:11|0:42:26|The man who was just talking to [Wei Shaolan]'s grandmother is Yan Xuezhan, a retired teacher from Nanbao Town. On the other side, [Wei Shaolan]'s grandmother has returned to the house, sitting on a stool and peeling fruit. The dustpan is placed next to the chair, with the peeled fruit skins falling directly into it, and she started coughing while peeling.
0:42:26|0:42:39|In the nursing home, several elderly people sit by the wall at the door chatting. An elderly man in a white short-sleeved shirt enters Grandma [Wei Shaolan]'s room. Grandma asks him how many photos he has taken after filming for so long.
0:43:8|0:43:16|"No theft, found it." She said, showing her grandmother the things in her hand, and then took out a red medal box to show her grandmother. The old lady scolded her.
0:45:5|0:45:14|Tied up and thrown into the river. Gesturing with both hands to show being tied up, as she spoke, the grandmother's voice choked up and she lowered her head.
0:45:15|0:45:17|Covering her eyes with her hands, her chin trembling.
0:45:26|0:45:41|The one who captured my mother was a Japanese soldier. Grandma blinked her eyes, her features wrinkled together, she propped up her head with her hands, couldn't help but cry, first breathing rapidly through her mouth, then her whole body started shaking visibly with emotion.
0:45:41|0:45:57|The grandmother fell silent in front of the camera, never showing her eyes. The bright sunlight of Hainan shone through the leaves of the nursing home, with 6 elderly people, 4 sitting together and 2 sitting at the door of their rooms, all on the same red stool.
0:45:57|0:46:15|On the other side, [Grandma Wei Shaolan] sat sideways in her chair with a backrest. The chair, now faded and turning white, had her coat draped over the armrest. She held a radio in her hand, playing traditional opera. Grandma glanced at the radio in her hand and started singing along softly.
0:46:15|0:46:21|In the sky, the clouds roll and unfold, in the quiet nursing home, the voice on the radio is strong and powerful.
0:46:22|0:46:29|The scene cuts back to the room, with [Wei Shaolan] sitting on a chair, recounting her youth.
0:46:47|0:46:59|[Wei Shaolan]'s cheeks trembled slightly, she turned her head slightly and continued: "On the surface, it seems like I oppose him after marrying him," pausing for a moment, [Wei Shaolan] said:
0:47:8|0:47:19|The Japanese man crippled me, and he's dead now. On this day, [Wei Shaolan] supported and pulled with both hands, gripping the armrest of the chair, wearing a pair of equally faded slippers on her feet, moving step by step towards the outside of the house.
0:47:20|0:47:27|Hanging on the chair is a large bunch of keys, swaying with every move. Vice director [Luo Shanxue] of the nursing home sits in the yard and says:
0:47:58|0:48:10|Because she was tortured by the Japanese to the point of disability, [Wei Shaolan] grandmother's daily routine involved moving in and out with the help of a chair. As Vice Dean [Luo Shanxue] put it, at mealtime, a female nurse walked out of the dining room with a bowl of rice in her hand.
0:48:10|0:48:16|Walking down the steps, [Wei Shaolan] slowly approached the door of Grandma's room, calling out as she walked, "Dinner is ready."
0:48:16|0:48:33|After walking to the doorway, [Ma Dongmei] placed the bowl in her hand on the stool by the door. After putting down the bowl, she carefully moved the stool a bit, then rearranged the bowl, said a few words to her grandmother [Wei Shaolan] inside the house, and walked in. During mealtime, [Wei Shaolan] and an elderly neighbor sat on the steps in front of the house eating their meals separately.
0:48:33|0:48:42|Grandma did not bend over, but propped up her knee with one hand, while the other hand reached the spoon into the bowl on the stool. Retired teacher Yan Xuezhan then said:
0:49:24|0:49:45|After finishing speaking, [Grandmother] curved her fingers and propped them beside her cheek. After taking a deep breath, she fell silent again, her eyes looking in one direction, lost in memories and thoughts. [Grandmother] blinked her eyes, her chest rising and falling noticeably. After a moment of silence, [Grandmother] moved her lips twice and said she didn't want to talk about it anymore.
0:49:48|0:49:59|As she spoke, the hand of [Grandmother] that propped up her cheek wiped under her nose, then moved up to her forehead. At night, half of the moon was already covered by dark clouds, which were continuously shifting towards the remaining half.
0:50:0|0:50:8|The next day it rained, and [Grandma Wei Shaolan] could only sit in the house watching the rain outside, the wind blowing her white hair by her temples.
0:50:9|0:50:15|In the dimly lit room, [Grandma] sat with her head down, and the lightning flashed twice.
0:50:20|0:50:28|Hearing a sound, [Grandma] lifted her head again and looked outside, rain falling on the window sill with a security net, splashing water continuously.
0:50:28|0:50:43|Grandma turned the chair from facing the door to facing outside, then bent down to pick up the fallen stick. She placed it against the door, stood up with the support of the chair's armrests, moved the chair into the room, sat down, and picked up the stick next to her.
0:50:43|0:50:56|Raindrops the size of beans fell delicately on the windowsill, the rain getting heavier and heavier. Inside the room, the lights were not turned on. Grandma Lin Ailan retreated into the room, closed the door, wiped her face with a towel, and leaned against the door's stick, falling to the ground.
0:50:56|0:51:5|Grandma bent down while closing the door tightly, picking up a stick and leaning it diagonally against the door. There was a narrow gap on the door, through which a faint light shone.
0:51:5|0:51:18|Outside, the rain started pouring down heavily. The doors of the nursing home were all closed. Turning to the entrance of the nursing home, in the empty courtyard, there were only the open iron gate and the pouring rain. Through a door, a view of an old-fashioned building was revealed.
0:51:18|0:51:32|The roof is made of tiles, with three red envelopes pasted in front of the door. The rain here is not heavy, but it is drizzling. An old man sits inside the house near the door, looking at the rain outside, with his arms on his legs and hands rubbing in the middle.
0:51:32|0:51:51|The old woman is called [Wei Shaolan], born in 1926. Following her gaze, one can see that the house in front is already very old, with large gaps appearing between the bricks and mud of the walls, and a few wooden sticks placed together barely serving as a door. After the rain, the puddles on the ground reflect the shadows of trees and the sun.
0:51:51|0:52:7|The droplets from the tree gently fell onto the stagnant water, creating ripples. The sky in Chengmai County, Hainan Province, was as clear as can be, with large white clouds slowly drifting by. Behind the roof, you could see distinctive coconut trees. Inside the simple house, [Grandma Wei Shaolan] was busy bending over on the ground.
0:52:7|0:52:23|Two legs, one with a rolled-up pant leg and the other not, support the body. He straightens his back, walks towards the low wooden stool in the middle of the room, bends his knees, and pulls the stool forward. After sitting down, he picks up the bowl on the table in front of him, stirs it with chopsticks, and then puts the rice into his mouth.
0:53:5|0:53:20|Grandma Li Meijin went out to find some firewood to cook rice. In the scene, [Grandma Li Meijin] was sitting on a stool holding a bowl, eating until the bowl was almost empty. She even scraped the bowl with chopsticks to finish every last bit without wasting any food.
0:53:20|0:53:38|In the outdoor afternoon, an old tree blocked the sunlight, and underneath it were people enjoying the cool breeze. [Grandma Li Meijin] was sitting among them. On the stone table were a water kettle and cups, with children playing nearby. [Grandma Li Meijin] and others were playing cards on the sturdy wooden table.
0:53:38|0:53:44|Several neighbors gathered together to chat, with one person constantly fanning themselves with a fan.
0:53:46|0:53:56|A woman holding a cup temporarily walks away, [Grandma Li Meijin] and the person at the same table successively picked up a card, the leisurely people's heads were visible in the sunlight among the leaves.
0:53:57|0:54:14|Night fell in the blink of an eye, with street lights shining like the moon hanging in the sky. The dust in the air was visible under the light. As the daytime bird chirping, children's laughter, and people's chatter gradually quieted down, [Grandma Li Meijin] began to recount her experiences from her youth.
0:55:6|0:55:21|The tips of their guns are not knives, right? In the scene, a knife quickly chops a coconut, the hands of two adults are peeling a jackfruit, and two children are also using knives to peel jackfruit. Under the same tree, an old man wearing a straw hat watches people busy at work.
0:55:21|0:55:37|Before long, a row of pineapples was displayed. The man picked out the clean ones in plastic bags, while the elderly man at the table poured coconut juice into a basin. The child held a coconut and drank straight from it, while the little girl squatted on the ground and gnawed on one. An old lady held a piece of coconut shell and handed it to the old man sitting by the tree.
0:57:44|0:57:56|From outside, you can see that [Luo Shanxue]'s grandmother lives in a self-built one-story building, with tiles pasted under the white walls and a rope pulled up at the edge for drying clothes. Inside the house, [Luo Shanxue]'s grandmother and her family are having a meal.
0:58:40|0:58:47|In the bright sunlight, [Grandma Luo Shanxue] stood at the door, continuously pumping water while fiddling with her hands.
0:58:48|0:58:57|With Grandma's pressing, water kept flowing into the bucket. After nearly half a bucket of water was drawn, Grandma lifted the handle and moved the bucket aside, then slowly squatted down.
0:58:58|0:59:8|After rinsing the clothes in the bucket twice, she took them out and placed them on the floor to scrub. Her body leaned against one leg as she vigorously rubbed and scrubbed with both hands.
0:59:9|0:59:18|The yellow dog behind walked into the room, the foam from washing clothes gradually increased on the bluestone, and the water in the bucket also decreased a bit.
0:59:19|0:59:21|[Grandma Luo Shanxue]'s voice rang out again,
1:0:18|1:0:35|That day, there was a young man chopping meat by the roadside. The young man held a knife in each hand, one to hold the meat steady and the other to chop. A woman, hearing the sound of chopping, covered her ears and stood up to move further away. Sitting next to her was an old man watching.
1:0:35|1:0:44|The person who was cooling off also cast a sidelong glance. One person even walked behind the young man and watched. [Luo Shanxue]'s grandmother was sitting not far behind the young man.
1:0:45|1:0:59|He leaned his arm on the armrest, with a silver bracelet slipped down to the middle of his forearm, fingers clenched into a fist resting beside his cheek, slightly turned to look at the young man. When they were on the mountain, [Luo Shanxue]'s grandmother wore a straw hat, bent over to chop some firewood.
1:1:24|1:1:31|In the scene, [Grandma Luo Shanxue] picks up the chopped firewood and looks around to find more wood to continue chopping.
1:1:48|1:1:54|When her husband got old, he had a stroke. After chopping the firewood, [Grandma Luo] tied the firewood into a bundle with branches.
1:2:21|1:2:29|[Grandma Luo Shanxue] sat in front of a low stool, lighting a fire with dry leaves and then stuffing it into the firewood pile, before going to the cutting board to chop vegetables.
1:2:53|1:3:9|Grandma picked up the cutting board, poured the vegetables into the pot, stirred them with a spatula, placed the cutting board on the table behind her, the fire under the pot burned more vigorously, smoke rose from the pot and wafted towards Grandma [Luo Shanxue]'s face. After stirring for a while, a simple meal was ready.
1:3:9|1:3:16|In the shabby kitchen, the rice cooker lid reflects the sunlight, and a rice ladle rests along the edge of the pot on the table.
1:3:29|1:3:52|In a dimly lit room, a beam of light shines through a circular hole in the wall, faintly revealing a dusty mooncake box hanging on the wall. Dust particles and lingering smoke float in the air within the beam of light, while [Luo Shanxue]'s grandmother sits next to the table, taking out a coin from her pocket and placing it on the table, playing cards with the old man across from her.
1:4:18|1:4:36|The camera turns to the wall with posters, one showing Chairman Mao giving a speech, the other showing Chairman Mao standing in front of a pine tree. "Every household in our village has Chairman Mao's photo posted," said [Grandma Li Meijin]. Next to the calendar with Chairman Mao's image, there are several large photo frames with family pictures.
1:4:37|1:4:54|In the frame, there is a black and white photo of a mother holding a child, an old-fashioned personal ID photo with lace edges, a solo color photo of a child, and a family color group photo. Various calendars are pasted on the mottled wall, and a tablecloth with red checkered patterns is spread on the table in the corner.
1:4:56|1:5:12|A framed photo hangs directly above the table, with a grandmother wearing a vest bending over in front of the table, tidying up something underneath. She is called [Li Ailian], born in 1928. After finishing tidying up, she pushes the chair at the edge of the table to move to the other side.
1:5:14|1:5:26|The scene shifts to outside the house, where the old earthen house's original door is no longer in use and has been blocked up with bricks. This is in Wuxiang County, Changzhi City, Shanxi Province.
1:5:44|1:6:3|She was asked if her leg still hurt, if she had taken any medicine, and if she could walk. A woman walked by talking on the phone, and there was a blackboard on the wall inside the room. At the top of the blackboard were pinyin letters, followed by numbers for comparison, arithmetic problems, and phonetic recognition of whole syllables. This woman is the daughter-in-law of Li Ailian, [Li Xiuping].
1:6:41|1:6:48|[Li Xiuping] paused and rubbed his hands in front of his nose.
1:7:37|1:7:45|Li Ailian sat on the kang and said, [Li Xiuping] lifted the door curtain and walked out. After speaking, [Li Xiuping] walked away.
1:7:46|1:8:3|In a room without the lights on, only the light from the door and windows, [Grandma Li Ailian] sat on the heated brick bed, one leg stretched out, the other bent, constantly rubbing her face with both hands, then looking out the window.
1:8:4|1:8:17|Through the window, you can see that it is starting to rain outside. The two windows above are still open inward, and [Grandma Li Ailian] is rubbing her chin, looking down in silence.
1:8:18|1:8:36|The sudden sound of thunder made her look up and gaze out the window. Only after the Japanese surrendered did she return, no longer fighting or bullying.
1:8:37|1:8:50|Outside the window, the rain is still falling, dripping onto the iron wire, forming droplets that hang and then slowly fall. [Grandma Li Ailian] is sitting by the bed, crying, and after a sob, she continues to speak:
1:8:58|1:9:20|It was probably the husband comforting himself at the time. The more Grandma talked, the sadder she became, shaking her head and whispering that she couldn't go on. After taking a deep breath, she picked up the tissue in her hand, gestured and said, "After I finish speaking, she placed the unfolded tissue on her face with both hands, slowly lowered her head, and pressed her index finger against her forehead."
1:9:20|1:9:24|Outside the window, the rain is still falling, and raindrops are dripping down from the eaves.
1:9:28|1:9:44|The rain was very fine and soft, but the raindrops falling from the eaves were large and heavy. Inside the house, [Li Ailian]'s grandmother was still quietly crying, accompanied by the sound of thunder, the scene gradually darkened.
1:9:45|1:10:0|The next day, the crops in the cornfield were growing well, and the sun was shining. There were thin clouds in the sky. [Li Ailian]'s grandmother was busy in the kitchen, cutting green onions and putting them in a bowl, then lifting the lid to check the situation in the pot.
1:10:1|1:10:8|Seeing that the water was boiling, [Ma Dongmei] picked up the ladle containing cold water and added some more.
1:10:40|1:10:59|After cutting another tomato, [Li Ailian] grabbed some noodles from a plastic bag and threw them into the pot. She stirred with chopsticks, then poured in the freshly cut tomatoes, quickly stirred again, covered the pot, and added two corn cobs into the fire. Before long, Grandma [Li Ailian] sat at the table and started eating the noodles herself.
1:11:56|1:12:10|She sat on the heated brick bed, refusing to bring up the past. When the interviewer arrived, she didn't speak the truth either. In the courtyard, [Grandma Li Ailian] stood under a tree next to the vegetables she had planted, suddenly spotting a cat.
1:12:23|1:12:39|Daughter-in-law [Li Xiuping] heard the sound and walked over. Seeing the kitten trying to enter the house, she quickly shouted and then pretended to approach, scaring the cat away from the door. She then walked back, bent down to pick some vegetables, and after picking enough, she held them with both hands and placed them aside.
1:13:35|1:13:50|Several cats lay outside the door meowing. [Li Ailian Grandma] leaned against the door frame and stepped out. She broke the food in her hand and threw it on the ground. The cats immediately ran over to eat it, and Grandma smiled.
1:14:2|1:14:7|Grandma asked why the cat didn't bring the child to eat together, and the other foot also stepped out of the door frame.
1:14:8|1:14:23|Back in the room, the TV was already on. [Li Ailian's grandmother] sat on the kang, then slowly moved to the edge of the bed, took something from the windowsill, held it in her hand, and sat back down. A TV set was placed on the cabinet, playing an old movie.
1:14:23|1:14:40|Above the television set, there is a cabinet with a sliding door. The camera shifts to the front of the TV, where a boy is leaning on the table with his arms, staring at the TV. Since the table is a bit far from the heated brick bed, the boy chooses to stand closer to watch TV.
1:14:41|1:14:57|[Grandma Li Ailian] on the kang leaned against the quilt, one leg crossed over the other, hands crossed in front, smiling as she looked at the boy. Grandma lowered her head, lifted one leg slightly, pulled the pant leg, then shifted her leg to the other side.
1:14:58|1:15:10|In this way, with both hands interlocking on the knees, [Grandma] unconsciously shakes her legs, obviously quite pleased.
1:15:40|1:15:56|In the scene, [Grandma Li Ailian] is carrying a bucket, slowly stepping over the wooden door, walking to the faucet, and turning on the tap to fetch water. As night falls, a cat lies on the roof, and through the windows and doors of [Grandma Li Ailian]'s house, a yellow light can be seen.
1:16:8|1:16:30|The wardrobe is half frosted glass and half mirrored. You can see [Grandma Li Ailian] on the kang stretching her legs to rest. The scene shifts to a lotus pond with many low hills in the distance, this is Lipu County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Inside a local household, a grandma sits by the door, fanning herself.
1:16:30|1:16:48|On the other side, an old man and a girl were talking. The old man had rolled up pant legs, hands resting on his knees, gesturing with his arms as he spoke, holding a cigarette in one hand. The girl was a journalist from a magazine in Beijing, nodding frequently as she listened, while a tricycle drove past the door.
1:16:48|1:16:54|The man being interviewed is [Luo Shanxue], born in 1945, of Chinese-Japanese descent.
1:17:24|1:17:34|The camera pans to the uneven ground, showing the feet of three people. A line of text appears on the screen, stating that due to his identity, 70-year-old [Luo Shanxue] has never been able to marry, and remains single to this day.
1:17:38|1:17:51|The reporter mentioned that a volunteer was helping [Luo Shanxue] find a wife. [Luo Shanxue] shook his head while smoking, and both of them laughed. The reporter was jotting down notes in his notebook, while a photographer was taking pictures of the grandma by the door.
1:17:51|1:18:8|Grandma is now sitting on a worn-out sofa, with a chair next to her serving as a table. On the makeshift table are a rice cooker and bowls, while a brand-new fan is placed on another table next to the sofa. Grandma sits on the sofa, crossing her legs and holding a bowl, eating while facing the camera.
1:18:8|1:18:24|The grandmother is called [Wei Shaolan], born in 1920, a Yao ethnic. Flies are crawling on the rice cooker and around the bowls on the table, but no one seems to care. Grandma [Wei Shaolan] holds a bowl and keeps putting rice into her mouth, using chopsticks to push it in bit by bit when it's at the edge of her mouth.
1:18:24|1:18:34|In another courtyard, a person is sunning a quilt on a pile of bricks. In front of a wall made of cement bricks, on a wooden sofa, an old woman is sitting hunched over, breaking something in her hands.
1:18:34|1:18:40|Accidentally dropping a piece, she searches for it on her own pants. The camera slowly moves up, revealing information about the old woman, her name is [He Yuzhen], born in 1921.
1:18:42|1:18:55|In 2014, he passed away. A small hole in the roof let in a beam of light into the dark room. The man who went to sweep the tomb of [Huang Yufeng] appeared again in the frame.
1:19:25|1:19:42|The man sat in the woods where the tombstone was and finished his speech. This man, named [Chen Houzhi], is an employee of the farm. Since 1996, he has been helping the victims in Hainan. After speaking, he took out his phone and flipped open the phone cover.
1:19:42|1:20:5|After dialing the phone, she put it to her face and spoke in Hainan dialect. The trees and grass behind her swayed in the wind. In the mountains on the other side, the girl who had visited [Wang Yukai]'s grandmother's house used a lighter to ignite the paper money. There were also several incense sticks in front of it. The stacked paper money was difficult to ignite, and the girl tried several times to light it.
1:20:56|1:21:19|The burning joss paper was finally lit, emitting smoke. The girl squatted on the ground with her chin in her hands, then stood up, poured out the wine from the bottle, and walked down the mountain with a black bag in hand. An old man carrying a shoulder pole passed by and glanced at her. A woman behind the old man was carrying a basket.
1:21:19|1:21:28|The old man took two steps and then turned around to look at the girl.
1:22:19|1:22:25|In the woods, the incense has burned out and the paper money is reduced to ashes.
1:22:40|1:22:46|Her name is [Mitan Mai], a Japanese exchange student who has been helping the victims in Hainan since 2009.
1:22:47|1:22:51|[Mai Tian Mai]'s figure gradually blurred, leaving only the grass swaying slightly at the edge of the field.
1:22:52|1:23:1|At the beginning of the film, the man giving a speech at the funeral walks into a room, rubbing his hands.
1:23:9|1:23:16|Sitting on the kang in the room is an old man, with a thin blanket covering his legs.
