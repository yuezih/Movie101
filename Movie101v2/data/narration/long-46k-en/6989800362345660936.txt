0:2:20|0:2:43|In the city, tall buildings stand densely, with crowds of people flowing continuously. At a traffic light intersection, a group of young people with blank expressions are standing. A girl with ear-length hair, wearing a smart suit and high heels, emerges in the crowd. With a calm expression and a face exuding confidence that can conquer the world.
0:2:43|0:2:59|The girl, [Xiong Dun], walked calmly towards the intersection as the green light lit up and the crowd surged towards the zebra crossing. When she reached the middle of the intersection, she suddenly stopped, hesitated for a while, and finally, let out a big sneeze. The ground suddenly cracked and collapsed downward.
0:3:7|0:3:19|On the ground, vehicles and crowds were suspended in mid-air due to inertia, with only [Xiong Dun] standing in the middle of the road. Like a superhero, she watched everything happening in front of her, feeling satisfied as she admired her masterpiece, a mischievous smile on her face.
0:3:19|0:3:31|She lowered her head, and the floating object in the air fell heavily to the ground. She moved forward and made a striking gesture. Then, the title of the film appeared. [Xiong Dun] maintained this posture, her thoughts pulled back to reality.
0:3:34|0:3:40|[Xiong Dun] snapped out of his daydream just now, standing in the middle of the road, bewildered and darting around aimlessly.
0:3:45|0:3:53|[Xiong Dun] patted her head in frustration, standing still on the street. She looked around in embarrassment.
0:4:0|0:4:7|At this moment, a wedding is taking place in a church. The groom is looking at the bride walking slowly towards him, with a happy smile on his face.
0:4:23|0:4:37|The church door was pushed open by someone, and [Xiong Dun] cautiously walked in. The guests turned their heads to look at [Xiong Dun], whispering about this intruder. The bride and groom looked puzzled, clearly not recognizing [Xiong Dun], who ran in with his head down.
0:4:37|0:4:45|Xiong Dun's boyfriend Xiao Chuan sat in the guest seat, looking at Xiong Dun running towards him with a look of despair. The priest, seeing this, breathed a sigh of relief and said.
0:5:23|0:5:29|[Xiong Dun] suddenly stared at the bride's shoulder. She said something and then reached out to tear it off.
0:5:37|0:5:44|Xiao Chuan dragged [Xiong Dun] expressionlessly by her arm to a table filled with desserts.
0:5:49|0:5:55|[Xiong Dun] picks up a cake and eats it while turning his head.
0:6:17|0:6:32|Xiong Dun was forcefully pressed a cake onto his mouth by Xiao Chuan, who then turned and left. Not long after, Xiong Dun started drinking at the table. Supporting his drowsy head, he looked around and saw that the table was already filled with empty glasses, at least a dozen of them. Overwhelmed by the alcohol, Xiong Dun soon got drunk.
0:7:29|0:7:33|[Lao Zheng] stands on the boxing ring, the audience below cheering and rooting for him. [Lao Zheng] easily dodges a punch and finally delivers a fatal blow to his opponent.
0:7:54|0:8:3|[Ai Mi] was scared by the monster in the movie, screamed, quickly dropped what she was holding, and covered her eyes.
0:8:12|0:8:17|[Ai Mi] looked at her colleague who was being scolded by the boss, taking a deep breath in shock.
0:9:2|0:9:17|[Ai Mi] sat on the sofa, looking at [Xiong Dun] with a helpless expression. A whole night had passed, [Xiong Dun] was still wearing yesterday's clothes, with messy hair. Her head was against the wall, sleeping soundly. She struggled to open her eyes, only to find herself sitting on the toilet, holding a plastic bucket in her hands.
0:9:17|0:9:24|Shortly after, she got up and started washing up, splashing cold water on her face. Just as she lifted her head, [Ai Mi] suddenly appeared behind her.
0:9:36|0:9:42|Xiong Dun's boss was touching up her makeup while getting angry. Xiong Dun kept his head down, doodling on a notebook.
0:10:22|0:10:33|[Xiong Dun] angrily tried to flip the table, but it didn't budge. Her colleagues around couldn't help but cover their mouths to stifle their laughter, while her boss was left speechless by her anger. Feeling embarrassed, [Xiong Dun] kicked the chair away and stormed out.
0:10:38|0:10:43|Halfway there, [Xiong Dun] suddenly stopped, a wicked expression on her face. She licked her thumb and headed straight for her boss.
0:10:43|0:10:52|She grabbed her boss's chin and rubbed it hard. A mole suddenly appeared on the boss's chin, looking around in panic. [Xiong Dun] smirked, satisfied, and turned away.
0:10:54|0:11:9|[Xiong Dun] ordered a table full of delicious food, eating the meat in her hands hungrily, trying to forget about the shadow of losing her job. Suddenly, her boyfriend [Xiao Xia] appeared at the entrance of the restaurant.
0:11:21|0:11:29|Xiong Dun, who was still in a daze, suddenly panicked. She dropped the bone in her hand, grabbed her bag, and ran off. After running a few steps, she realized she had forgotten her phone.
0:11:31|0:11:46|[Xiong Dun] had nowhere to go, so he simply hid under the table. The waiter took away the unfinished meal of [Xiong Dun]. The girl took the menu handed to her by Xiao Chuan and flipped through it. Suddenly, [Xiong Dun] noticed that his scarf was still on the bench, so he reached out to grab it.
0:11:47|0:11:54|She quickly pulled the scarf over and accidentally touched the girl's leg.
0:12:9|0:12:13|Xiong Dun's phone ringtone gave away her location, causing her to panic for a moment.
0:12:23|0:12:32|[Xiong Dun] lifted the table over her head, blocking her face, not wanting to be discovered. She frantically felt for direction, trying to escape forward, only to be blocked by the glass door. The table was hit and fell to the ground.
0:12:32|0:12:46|[Xiong Dun] rushed out of the door, with Xiaochuan anxiously calling out behind her. However, no matter how Xiaochuan shouted, [Xiong Dun] didn't want to look back anymore. She threw the scarf around her neck back, pretending to stride forward nonchalantly, her mood plummeting to the bottom of the valley.
0:12:46|0:13:2|The cold atmosphere turned the surrounding environment into a snowy world. The tall buildings around her were gradually surrounded by ice, and even the trash cans and fire hydrants on the roadside were not spared. The billboards on the skyscrapers all turned into photos of Xiao Chuan and [Xiong Dun], and eventually, they were slowly consumed by the ice.
0:13:2|0:13:16|A boy skateboarding past [Xiong Dun] suddenly freezes into a sculpture in mid-air. The mall has turned into a frozen wasteland, with shoppers gradually being encased in ice. A newspaper is blown by the wind and flies past.
0:13:16|0:13:34|Walking past [Xiong Dun], there was a photo of him and Xiao Chuan printed on it. He was instantly frozen in place. Someone fell on the street, their coffee and newspaper flying out of their hands, but they were frozen in ice and stuck on the roadside. [Xiong Dun] walked forward like an Ice Queen, freezing everything around him.
0:13:34|0:13:49|The ice crackled, [Xiong Dun] stopped, her face expressionless. She looked up and saw the buildings around her covered in snow and the sky turned cold grey. The path she walked on instantly turned into ice.
0:13:49|0:14:4|At that moment, the whole world was frozen. [Xiong Dun], who was unemployed and heartbroken, felt just like this cold icy world. That night, [Xiong Dun] didn't go home.
0:14:16|0:14:37|[Xiong Dun] sat on a bench by the street, listening to her friends' voices, pouting with grievances, her eyes red, but stubbornly holding back the tears. At this moment, her phone rang, she lowered her head to look, it was her mother calling, she placed her hand on the answer button, took a deep breath.
0:15:34|0:15:51|[Xiong Dun] didn't want to worry her parents, so she lied without a trace. After hanging up the phone, the tension in her heart also eased. As night fell, the shops behind [Xiong Dun] lit up with lights, people coming and going, casting a lonely figure of [Xiong Dun]. She sighed and swallowed back the sadness in her heart.
0:15:51|0:16:3|The scene cuts to Xiong Dun stepping out of the elevator, looking down to fish out her keys while glancing towards the door. A sticky note on the door reads "See you at the usual place." As she returns home, the lights suddenly come on.
0:16:35|0:16:44|In front of [Xiong Dun] was a dartboard with a photo of Xiao Chuan on it. She turned around and glared at the three people, asking.
0:16:58|0:17:3|[Xiong Dun] threw a dart while speaking.
0:17:54|0:18:2|[Xiong Dun] opened the red envelope with a joyful expression on her face, only to find a stack of lottery tickets inside. Her expression changed immediately.
0:18:34|0:18:48|The four of them stood up in unison, raised their glasses, and drank in one gulp. [Xiong Dun] suddenly put down the food in her hand, turned and ran towards the rooftop. She pushed open the glass door leading to the rooftop, and the four of them leaned over the edge, shouting loudly into the distance.
0:19:2|0:19:18|Four people are playing wildly on the rooftop, spraying champagne on each other. Even the birthday cake is used as a weapon, with everyone's face covered in cream. The scene shifts to Xiong Dun carefully unraveling a scarf knitted from wool.
0:19:30|0:19:37|[Xiong Dun] couldn't help but recall the painful memory of breaking up with her first boyfriend, who pointed at the plain-dressed [Xiong Dun].
0:19:51|0:19:58|She dressed herself up as an artistic girl again, but her third boyfriend chose a tall stewardess.
0:20:6|0:20:13|[Xiong Dun] ran happily towards the bedroom. Suddenly, there was a strange noise coming from the bedroom.
0:20:19|0:20:33|Immediately, nervously looking at [Lao Zheng] and [Xiao Xia] beside him, the three of them got up and ran towards the bedroom. They saw [Xiong Dun] lying flat on the ground. The screen went black, and then,
0:20:33|0:20:51|[Xiong Dun] lay on the hospital bed with an oxygen mask on. She tightly closed her eyes, but soon slowly opened them to find herself in the hospital. The sunlight shone on her face, and it was unusually quiet around, with only the sounds of machines operating and water dripping. She took off the oxygen mask and sat up.
0:20:51|0:21:9|Bewildered, she looked around and found that besides herself, there was no one else in the room. She got up and walked out of the ward, only to be greeted by a dilapidated corridor with eerie flickering lights. Her gaze fell on a security door not far away. On the door, it was written in bold letters, "Danger, do not approach."
0:21:9|0:21:25|In bold red letters. [Xiong Dun] refuses to believe in superstitions, bravely moving forward step by step. The surrounding facilities are already in ruins, with telecommunication cables tangled messily. In the corridor, eerie singing can be heard, she stands still, staring intently at the security door not far away. At this moment,
0:21:25|0:21:38|Outside the door, several zombies with gaping mouths suddenly appeared. Through the glass, the zombies saw [Xiong Dun] not far away and began to fiercely pound on the door. [Xiong Dun] retreated in fear, but before he could take a few steps back, the zombies broke open the door blocked by a baseball bat.
0:21:38|0:21:58|Before long, hordes of zombies poured in from the doorway. However, [Xiong Dun] was already scared stiff, only retreating backwards and accidentally stepping on a belt, causing the metal on the belt to make a noise that caught the attention of the zombie horde. They suddenly started rushing towards [Xiong Dun], who didn't run away but instead stood still. The fear on his face disappeared in an instant, replaced by a resolute and fierce look in his eyes.
0:21:58|0:22:10|She kicked the belt on the ground with her foot and tied it around her waist, with two pistols hanging on her waist. She grabbed a piece of cloth, tied it around her shoulders as a cape, quickly took out the pistols, and shot at the approaching zombies.
0:22:10|0:22:19|[Xiong Dun]'s marksmanship is steady and fierce, with clean and swift movements. In a moment, she has taken out many zombies. She jumps down, stepping on a zombie's shoulder, and performs a magnificent spin in the air.
0:22:19|0:22:28|Riding on top of the zombie, she aimed a shot at its head. With a gun in each hand, she charged into the zombie horde, and soon ran out of bullets. Just then,
0:22:28|0:22:41|At the other end of the corridor, a large number of zombies appeared. [Xiong Dun], however, remained calm and took out two new magazines from her waist, threw them into the air, and quickly replaced them. She raised her gun, spread her arms, spun in place, and shot at the zombies on both sides, causing them to fall one after another.
0:22:41|0:22:51|[Xiong Dun] kicks a zombie away, then jumps in place, flying onto the nearby wall. She runs forward along the wall, shooting as she goes, then performs a mid-air spin before landing on the ground.
0:22:51|0:22:59|She lifted her head, looking at the remaining three zombies, with a victorious smile on her face. She stood up to continue shooting, only to find that the bullets had run out, [Xiong Dun] clenched his fists.
0:22:59|0:23:8|Aiming at the zombie's head, she used all her strength to charge forward. At this moment, the scene shifted, and [Xiong Dun] was lying on a hospital bed in reality. She suddenly roared and sat up straight.
0:23:14|0:23:21|[Xiong Dun] slowly opened his eyes, with [Doctor Liang] wearing a mask standing by the bedside.
0:23:23|0:23:44|[Doctor Liang] felt the burning gaze of [Xiong Dun], so [Doctor Liang] quickly put the pen in his pocket and lowered his head to check on [Xiong Dun].
0:23:59|0:24:10|[Xiong Dun] suddenly sat up excitedly. The smile on her face disappeared instantly and she lay back down. As [Doctor Liang] examined her, [Xiong Dun] cried out in pain. [Lao Zheng], [Ai Mi], and [Xiao Xia] walked in.
0:24:11|0:24:21|[Lao Zheng] is teasing [Xiong Dun] at the foot of the bed. [Xiong Dun] extends his finger and makes a threatening gesture towards [Lao Zheng]. [Doctor Liang] is looking through [Xiong Dun]'s test results while slowly taking off his mask.
0:24:21|0:24:35|[Xiong Dun] stared at [Doctor Liang]'s face, his eyes shining. He had a meticulously sculpted face, a high nose bridge, and delicate lips. [Xiong Dun] was dumbfounded. [Doctor Liang] was completely unaware of [Xiong Dun]'s gaze.
0:24:52|0:24:58|[Doctor Liang] settled everything and walked away with the list in hand, as [Xiong Dun] exclaimed excitedly.
0:25:27|0:25:34|Shortly after, [Xiong Dun] entered the room where the biopsy was being performed.
0:25:58|0:26:15|[Xiong Dun] stopped undressing and lay back. She couldn't contain her excitement, propping her head with her hand and raising one foot. Then she lay on the bed to fix her hair, holding her chin with her hand, lost in thought. At that moment, a nurse walked in.
0:26:20|0:26:32|[Xiong Dun] hadn't reacted yet when a white-haired, already balding [Doctor Liang] walked in. Holding a huge syringe, the [doctor] smiled kindly at [Xiong Dun]. [Xiong Dun] widened his eyes and then fainted in fear.
0:26:32|0:26:39|After the examination, [Xiong Dun] groggily opened his eyes. Suddenly, a [Xiao Xia] holding a pen appeared in front of him.
0:26:50|0:26:58|[Xiao Xia] smirked, revealing his missing front tooth. [Xiong Dun] looked at the unresponsive [Xiao Xia], stood up angrily, grabbed his leg and put him down.
0:26:59|0:27:7|She got out of bed, put on her shoes, and walked out while moving her shoulders. [Xiao Xia] sat on [Xiong Dun]'s bed, watching her leave.
0:27:9|0:27:21|With a strange smile on his face, [Xiong Dun] walked out of the ward, hands in his pockets, pacing in the hallway. People around him looked at [Xiong Dun] with strange eyes, some even laughed. [Xiong Dun] felt the strangeness of the people around him, but didn't know what had happened.
0:27:21|0:27:33|Uncomfortably scratching his head, Xiong Dun ran to the bathroom. In the mirror, Xiong Dun's face was painted with a black watercolor pen. It had a little mustache and an eye patch, making him look like a pirate. Xiong Dun was so angry that he huffed and puffed.
0:27:38|0:27:50|A rural man walked in, the little boy's father turned his head and greeted [Xiong Dun] expressionlessly.
0:28:8|0:28:15|[Mao Dou's Dad] turned and walked out. Seeing this, [Xiong Dun] quickly pulled [Mao Dou] in front of him and asked.
0:28:19|0:28:34|[Xiong Dun] stared at [Mao Dou], biting his lip and rolling his eyes, then his imagination ran wild. In his imagination, [Mao Dou's Dad] stood in a dim corridor, surrounded by smoke, wearing sunglasses, with a cigarette in his mouth and a machine gun in his hand, continuously firing ahead.
0:28:34|0:28:47|The firepower gradually increases, continuously shooting towards the camera. [Doctor Liang] suddenly bursts in through the door.
0:29:23|0:29:35|[Doctor Liang] suppressed a smile and glanced at [Mao Dou]. [Xiong Dun] nodded obediently and watched [Doctor Liang] leave. Then he turned his head and glared at [Mao Dou] who was smirking on the side.
0:29:41|0:29:48|[Lao Zheng] and [Xiao Xia] came to see [Xiong Dun]. [Mao Dou] pointed at [Lao Zheng]'s chest, insisting that he was his brother, which made [Lao Zheng] quickly stand up to prove otherwise.
0:30:8|0:30:15|[Xiao Xia], influenced by [Mao Dou], stared at [Lao Zheng] on the side. [Xiao Xia] was startled and quickly averted her gaze.
0:30:16|0:30:24|[Lao Zheng] wrapped his coat tightly. [Xiao Xia] accompanied [Mao Dou], playing on the side. In the corridor.
0:30:53|0:31:9|[Xiong Dun] stood aside, watching everything. When the woman walked over, he quickly turned his head and looked away. The woman threw the cigarette butt into the trash can at [Xiong Dun]'s feet. Curious, [Xiong Dun] couldn't help but look, but the woman gave him a disdainful look.
0:31:12|0:31:27|[Doctor Liang] examined [Xiong Dun] and, at the same time, comforted her with a gentle tone. [Xiong Dun] bit her hand tightly in pain, holding back tears. In the hospital room, [Mao Dou] touched [Xiong Dun]'s head.
0:31:48|0:31:56|[Xiong Dun] was touched on the wound and instinctively waved his hand towards [Mao Dou].
0:31:57|0:32:4|[Mao Dou] suddenly started to have a nosebleed, [Xiong Dun] quickly pressed the call button. [Doctor Liang] and the nurse rushed over with a gurney.
0:32:12|0:32:18|[Xiong Dun] lowered his head guiltily. He looked like a child who had done something wrong, with a worried expression as he gazed at [Mao Dou].
0:32:30|0:32:42|[Xiong Dun] 's face changed, he swallowed hard, thinking about his illness, and couldn't help but start to have wild thoughts.
0:32:51|0:33:8|With wide eyes full of fear, she collapsed on the bed, her mind racing with new fantasies. In her fantasy, [Xiong Dun] was wearing a wool coat and fluffy earmuffs, standing by a lake. It was snowing heavily, her face pale and her body weak. Before long, she couldn't hold on any longer, closed her eyes, and fell backwards.
0:33:8|0:33:22|But before she could fall to the ground, the scene suddenly froze, her body suspended in mid-air. The snowflakes floating in the air also stopped moving, as if time had come to a standstill. In the distance, the figure of Doctor Liang appeared suddenly, walking slowly towards Xiong Dun.
0:33:22|0:33:34|His eyes were filled with worry and reluctance. He walked up, his eyes red, his brows furrowed tightly, looking at [Xiong Dun]. He reached out his hand, embraced her around the waist, but [Xiong Dun] kept her eyes tightly shut, unaware.
0:33:34|0:33:48|Doctor Liang held Xiong Dun tightly and raised one arm, casting a spell into the air. The world immediately returned to its original state, time began to flow again, and snowflakes started falling once more. Xiong Dun woke up and locked eyes with Doctor Liang. Doctor Liang spoke in Korean.
0:34:3|0:34:20|One hundred, one thousand, ten thousand, I am satisfied with all. [Xiong Dun] was stunned, before he could answer, [Doctor Liang] slowly leaned in. The two closed their eyes tacitly and passionately kissed in the snowy landscape. [Xiong Dun] was immersed in this beautiful dream and refused to wake up.
0:34:20|0:34:36|Lying on the hospital bed with her mouth pouted, she then revealed a dreamy smile and gradually woke up. She rolled her eyes and looked to the side, meeting the gaze of [Doctor Liang]. [Doctor Liang] furrowed his brow, looking at her with a strange expression. There were about ten people gathered around the hospital bed.
0:34:36|0:34:44|[Xiong Dun] covers his face, avoiding the gaze of the crowd.
0:35:15|0:35:26|[Xiong Dun], wearing heavy makeup and a low-cut dress, walked back and forth in the hospital building. Just as she walked down the escalator, she saw [Doctor Liang] approaching with two other doctors. [Xiong Dun] gave a sly smile.
0:35:26|0:35:35|Wearing high heels and full of confidence, she walked up and pretended to pass by. Doctor Liang, however, frowned, looked through the documents in his hand, and didn't even see Xiong Dun.
0:35:42|0:35:57|The scene shifts to a room where Doctor Liang and another doctor are examining the patient's films. Xiong Dun, like a shadow, follows behind Doctor Liang, leaning against a table not far away, trying to catch Doctor Liang's attention with all his might.
0:35:57|0:36:8|[Doctor Liang] was so engrossed in his work that he didn't even notice [Xiong Dun] standing beside him. He turned around and walked away, leaving [Xiong Dun] rolling his eyes in resignation before determinedly following after him. [Doctor Liang] continued his rounds in the ward.
0:36:8|0:36:24|[Xiong Dun] stood outside the glass window, swaying back and forth. When the nurse saw [Xiong Dun], she quickly pulled up the curtain. At that moment, three men dressed as farmers were discussing [Doctor Liang] in the hallway.
0:36:28|0:36:35|[Doctor Liang] pushed open a door and walked out. [Xiong Dun] rushed forward and dragged him away.
0:36:37|0:36:44|[Doctor Liang] was startled by [Xiong Dun], who pushed open the door of a storage room and pulled [Doctor Liang] inside to hide.
0:36:56|0:37:4|Face to face, squeezed into a small storage room, they involuntarily get closer. [Xiong Dun] widens his eyes and lifts his head.
0:37:10|0:37:18|[Xiong Dun] suddenly stopped and changed the subject. She blinked her eyes, asking [Doctor Liang] to look.
0:37:33|0:37:39|[Doctor Liang] paused for a moment, feeling that he was not serious enough. Then he continued.
0:37:48|0:37:56|Upon hearing Doctor Liang's explanation, Xiong Dun's smile disappeared instantly. Doctor Liang's expression, on the other hand, began to look unnatural and his heartbeat started to accelerate.
0:38:18|0:38:29|[Xiong Dun] didn't want to part with [Doctor Liang] yet, so he deliberately delayed. He buried his head on [Doctor Liang]'s shoulder, unable to hold back his laughter. After succeeding, [Xiong Dun] couldn't help but start to daydream again.
0:38:29|0:38:43|She fantasized that she and [Doctor Liang] were on a beach, with the crutch that [Doctor Liang] was leaning on turning into a coconut tree. The bright sun shone on their faces and the beach beside them. [Xiong Dun] nestled against [Doctor Liang]'s chest, shyly covering her face.
0:38:43|0:38:59|[Doctor Liang] looked around and rested his chin on top of [Xiong Dun]'s head, extending his other arm to embrace [Xiong Dun]. [Xiong Dun] placed his hand on [Doctor Liang]'s chest, closing his eyes contentedly. Startled by his own fart, [Xiong Dun] was brought back to reality, making the atmosphere extremely awkward.
0:39:5|0:39:11|The two walked out, only to be tripped by the clutter on the floor, with [Doctor Liang] quickly catching the unsteady [Xiong Dun].
0:39:55|0:39:57|[Doctor Liang] did not take the money and lowered his head in shame.
0:40:4|0:40:12|[Doctor Liang] gathered up the courage and said this sentence, the air suddenly quieted down. Several people fell silent, their faces filled with undeniable sadness.
0:40:21|0:40:36|Lao Cui was stunned, looking at the innocent and naive [Mao Dou], not knowing how to respond for a moment.
0:40:46|0:41:8|[Xiong Dun] half lying on the bed, holding a pen and notebook in her hand, watching the lively [Mao Dou] with a fond smile. Lao Cui looked at his son's figure, sighed softly, met eyes with [Xiong Dun] for a moment, then immediately shifted his gaze, stood up, and slowly started packing his luggage.
0:41:17|0:41:28|Turning around and standing by the window, crying heartbreakingly, his shoulders shaking uncontrollably, he buried his head lower and lower, unable to straighten up. The sunlight streamed in from the window, illuminating the desolate figure of this father.
0:41:30|0:41:42|The hospital was bustling with people coming and going, all seeking medical help. There were [Doctor Liang] and nurses hurrying around, as well as the hopeful family members of the patients. But Lao Cui's hope was already gone.
0:41:56|0:42:1|[Xiong Dun] stopped the pen she was drawing with, turned her head to look at [Mao Dou], and asked as she put down the pen.
0:42:9|0:42:29|[Mao Dou] looked at [Xiong Dun] expectantly. [Xiong Dun] couldn't help but burst into laughter.
0:42:31|0:42:37|She tidied up the things in her hands. [Mao Dou] lay on the bed, unable to hide his joy.
0:43:26|0:43:45|[Mao Dou] listened to [Xiong Dun]'s story and suddenly felt drowsy. She closed her eyes and fell asleep. The next day, everyone sent [Mao Dou] out of the hospital together. [Xiong Dun] gave [Mao Dou] a handmade flipbook and squatted on the ground, vividly demonstrating it to [Mao Dou].
0:44:11|0:44:25|[Mao Dou] patted [Xiong Dun] on the shoulder like a little adult, then turned around to playfully fight with [Xiao Xia] behind him. [Xiong Dun] turned his head and shared a smile with [Lao Zheng], while the nearby Lao Sun shouted with a smile. Hearing his dad's call, [Mao Dou] ran off.
0:44:33|0:44:38|[Mao Dou] happily lay on his father's shoulder. [Xiong Dun's Mother] and the others looked at [Mao Dou].
0:44:50|0:45:2|[Xiong Dun] leaned on [Lao Zheng]'s shoulder, and [Lao Zheng] comfortingly patted her back. At night, [Doctor Liang] stood at the edge of the rooftop wall lost in thought, while [Xiong Dun] wrapped herself tightly and silently walked over.
0:45:31|0:45:37|[Xiong Dun] pretended to ask casually, anxiously waiting for an answer, but [Doctor Liang] did not give her a direct response.
0:46:10|0:46:16|The two people joked around, and the atmosphere became more cheerful.
0:47:19|0:47:26|She imagined giving herself a slap. The beaten [Xiong Dun] covered her face in grievance.
0:47:30|0:47:39|[Xiong Dun] was caught off guard, slowly turning his eyes and awkwardly grimacing, wishing he could fly away immediately. A sudden ringtone from a cellphone broke the awkward silence.
0:47:48|0:47:56|[Xiong Dun] nodded obediently and watched [Doctor Liang] leave out of the corner of her eye. She felt too embarrassed and banged her head against the nearby wall.
0:47:56|0:48:17|Then he made a gesture of shooting himself in the head with his hand, followed by a stabbing motion towards his abdomen, and finally collapsed against the wall pretending to be dead. [Doctor Liang] was not far away, watching her with a smile in his eyes. The next day, [Xiao Xia] and [Lao Zheng] were sitting in [Doctor Liang]'s office.
0:48:39|0:48:53|[Lao Zheng] snatched the file from [Doctor Liang]'s hand, and after seeing the results, [Lao Zheng] had an expression of disbelief, sitting in a daze on the chair, unable to come to his senses for a long time. Seeing [Lao Zheng]'s reaction, [Xiao Xia] panicked, only to see the diagnosis results written on it.
0:48:53|0:48:59|Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Later, the two of them found [Ai Mi] and the three of them sat in the hospital cafeteria.
0:49:32|0:49:41|[Xiao Xia] looked at [Ai Mi] speaking earnestly, and then raised her hand. At this moment, [Xiong Dun] suddenly walked in, and the conversation among the three came to a sudden halt.
0:49:58|0:50:12|[Xiong Dun] said casually. Lao Zheng immediately lowered his head to avoid [Xiong Dun]'s gaze. [Ai Mi] glanced at Lao Zheng, hesitated to speak, her eyes wandering.
0:50:58|0:51:4|[Xiong Dun] puts his hands together and closes his eyes, but [Ai Mi] and the other two are not happy.
0:51:22|0:51:38|[Xiong Dun] pushed the chair back and stood up, patting [Xiao Xia] on the shoulder. She happily spread her arms, humming a song, and ran out. Lao Zheng sighed, and [Ai Mi] also looked worried.
0:51:50|0:52:3|[Xiao Xia] was caught off guard and stood there in a daze. Lao Zheng sat angrily against the backrest, and the three of them fell silent. That evening, [Xiao Xia] sat on the sofa eating noodles from a lunchbox, while Lao Zheng anxiously searched for something nearby.
0:52:16|0:52:21|Lao Zheng suddenly slammed the drawer shut and sat down on the floor heavily.
0:52:30|0:52:40|Sitting at the dining table, [Ai Mi] couldn't control herself and started to cry. Lao Zheng waved his hand, trying hard to restrain his emotions.
0:52:41|0:52:51|[Xiao Xia] lowered her head with red eyes, slurping noodles in an attempt to escape the grief. Lao Zheng continued searching for the disc, but suddenly stood up and knocked over [Xiao Xia]'s lunchbox on the ground.
0:52:54|0:52:58|[Xiao Xia] was startled by [Lao Zheng]'s sudden movement, her hands frozen in midair.
0:52:58|0:53:9|The noodles in his mouth, not yet swallowed, he looked up at [Lao Zheng] with tears in his eyes. [Lao Zheng] looked down at [Xiao Xia], and finally, like a deflated ball, he slumped onto the sofa.
0:53:9|0:53:23|On the side, [Ai Mi] couldn't help but shed tears. The three of them fell into silence, and [Xiao Xia] finally couldn't hold back her tears either. At this moment, [Xiong Dun] sat in the hospital corridor, holding a tablet in his hand with the comic strips he created displayed on it.
0:53:23|0:53:40|The protagonist in the comic is wearing a patient gown, with a group of devils behind him. Unable to escape, the protagonist turns around and unleashes a fireball, driving away all the devils. Then, a line of text appears on the screen, "Get lost, Tumor King." The next day, Xiong Dun is sitting on the toilet, searching for information on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
0:53:40|0:53:44|In the restroom stall, there was suddenly a commotion.
0:53:54|0:54:8|[Xiong Dun] opened the toilet door and walked out, looking curiously to the side. As she washed her hands, the person from the next stall walked out, turning out to be the glamorous woman who was smoking in the hallway earlier. [Xiong Dun] couldn't help but glance at her sideways, and both reached for the hand soap at the same time.
0:54:8|0:54:16|The woman turned her head, staring coldly at [Xiong Dun], who was a little scared and more like a servant, taking the initiative to help her squeeze the hand sanitizer.
0:54:44|0:54:55|[Xia Meng] stood by the window and hung up the phone, then turned around. [Xiong Dun] sat on the bed, biting his finger, staring blankly at the fruit on the table placed by [Xia Meng]. Seeing this, [Xia Meng] picked up the fruit basket and brought it in front of [Xiong Dun].
0:54:57|0:55:4|[Xiong Dun] bit his finger, showing a look of being pleasantly surprised, and tremblingly took out a small bunch of grapes.
0:55:6|0:55:23|[Xiong Dun] once again falls into her own fantasy. She imagines herself in an ancient palace, wearing Qing Dynasty clothing, kneeling on the ground, carefully aiming ahead. [Xia Meng] is dressed in gorgeous attire, with two palace maids standing beside her, her fingers elegantly raised.
0:55:23|0:55:39|Picking up a bunch of grapes from the table, [Xiong Dun] threw it on the ground. He looked up and saw Xia Meng, startled, he quickly bent down and crawled over to pick up the grapes.
0:55:42|0:55:52|[Xia Meng] rolled her eyes disdainfully, the scene shifted back to reality. [Xia Meng] was lying on the bed wearing headphones and reading a book. [Xiong Dun] felt [Xia Meng]'s gaze and smiled as he handed her a bunch of grapes.
0:55:52|0:56:8|[Xia Meng] coldly turned her head away from her. Due to the chemotherapy, [Xiong Dun] began to vomit continuously. She crouched by the toilet, coughing from being choked by her own vomit, curling up into a ball, her face as white as paper. After emptying her stomach, [Xiong Dun] walked out of the bathroom looking haggard.
0:56:8|0:56:13|She walked forward weakly, but a familiar voice appeared in her ears.
0:56:22|0:56:27|[Xiong Dun] saw his parents carrying big and small bags, holding back tears and smiling. The scene then shifted to a few days ago,
0:56:52|0:57:0|[Xiong Dun's Father] and mother saw their daughter, the three of them looked at each other in silence.
0:57:35|0:57:47|Doctor Liang explained Xiong Dun's condition to Xiong Dun's parents. They sat in silence on the chairs, Xiong Dun's mother with tears in her eyes, not saying a word. Xiong Dun's father also looked lost.
0:57:47|0:57:53|[Xiong Dun's Parents] walked out of the office, with [Xiong Dun]'s mother looking dazed, as if she had lost her soul, and she left first.
0:57:53|0:58:8|[Xiong Dun's Father] nodded slightly to [Doctor Liang] and followed. [Doctor Liang] stood at the office door, watching the lonely figures of the two elderly people, feeling sorry in his heart. Halfway there, [Xiong Dun's Parents] stopped, both trying hard to control their tears.
0:58:10|0:58:22|[Xiong Dun's Father] with red eyes, found an excuse to turn and leave. [Xiong Dun's Mother] stood still, unable to control herself anymore, and started to sob. Then, she quickly wiped away her tears, forced herself to calm down, and walked forward. Inside the supermarket,
0:58:22|0:58:35|[Xiong Dun's Father] stood in front of a row of shelves, carefully selecting snacks for his daughter. Various bags of chips were displayed on the shelves, he picked up one casually, squinted his old eyes, furrowed his brows, and scrutinized the words on it repeatedly.
0:58:35|0:58:46|After watching for a while, he finally put it into the shopping bag with relief, then picked up the next one. He picked up another bag of potato chips, slowly placed it in front of his eyes, studied the words on it, and couldn't hold back anymore.
0:58:46|0:59:1|The moment of strength he had previously built up crumbled, as he slowly lowered the hand holding the potato chips and began to cry silently. His other hand, weakly propping up the nearby shelf, as if afraid that if he didn't do so, he would collapse. He sobbed, his shoulders shaking violently with each cry.
0:59:1|0:59:14|He seemed to age a lot in an instant. The little girl next to him saw Xiong Dun's Father, who was choked with sobs, and cast a concerned look at him, but didn't dare to approach. She could only turn around and leave, afraid of disturbing him. People around also turned back curiously.
0:59:14|0:59:23|I don't know why this old man is crying. [Xiong Dun's Father] cried for a while, then wiped his tears, put the potato chips back into the basket, composed himself, and turned to leave.
0:59:43|0:59:52|[Xiong Dun] nodded perfunctorily. [Xiong Dun] turned his head to look at his mother with a pretended calmness, stuck out his tongue to lick the candy stains off the corners of his mouth, and his mother angrily pushed [Xiong Dun's Mother] away.
1:0:32|1:0:38|[Doctor Liang] entered the room with a group of interns. Upon seeing [Doctor Liang], [Xiong Dun] immediately sat up straight, pretending to be a lady.
1:0:40|1:0:53|A young doctor picked up the file. [Xiong Dun] sat on the hospital bed, feeling secretly delighted.
1:2:58|1:3:13|The man rode away on a motorcycle without mercy, with [Xia Meng] shouting behind him. Pedestrians hurriedly passed by on the street, while [Xiong Dun] lay by the window, shocked by everything. At night, [Xia Meng] sat dejectedly by the window, with a pile of beer cans on the windowsill.
1:3:13|1:3:28|She cried while picking up a beer to drink. [Xiong Dun] slept soundly with an eye mask on, but was awakened by the movement of [Xia Meng]. [Xiong Dun] lifted his eye mask and glanced at [Xia Meng]. Sensing [Xiong Dun]'s gaze, [Xia Meng] covered her eyes, put down the beer in her hand, and stood up again.
1:3:28|1:3:32|Carrying several unfinished cans of beer in his arms, he turned around and walked out.
1:3:32|1:3:48|[Xiong Dun] stared intently at [Xia Meng]'s every move, feeling uneasy. She immediately lifted the blanket, got out of bed, grabbed the coat on the chair, and hurried out without even taking off her eye mask. She followed [Xia Meng] stealthily to the rooftop. [Xia Meng] placed the beer can by the railing, preparing to climb up.
1:4:6|1:4:12|[Xia Meng] finished speaking and started drinking by herself. [Xiong Dun] looked on eagerly. Xia Meng glanced at Xiong Dun and said.
1:4:15|1:4:26|[Xiong Dun] grinned widely, infecting [Xia Meng] as well. The two of them hit it off immediately and started their own night of revelry. The scene shifted to [Xia Meng] dressed in a cool leather jacket, wearing a helmet, riding a motorcycle.
1:4:26|1:4:41|[Xiong Dun] sat behind her, excitedly opening her arms and shouting. The two of them swiftly drove through a tunnel filled with parked cars, releasing long-suppressed emotions, throwing away pain and worries, indulging themselves on this special night.
1:5:0|1:5:7|[Xiong Dun] was at a loss for words and could only pick up a beer can, drinking continuously.
1:6:18|1:6:34|Pouring out their innermost thoughts, they gradually established a friendship. After finishing his drink, [Xiong Dun] leaned against the railing of the overpass, looking up at the sky and joyfully shouting. The camera slowly pulled back to reveal a large pile of empty beer cans at their feet, with the cold wind blowing their scarves.
1:6:34|1:6:41|The next day, [Xiong Dun] sat in front of the mirror in the dressing room, reluctant to touch his thick hair, sighing.
1:7:5|1:7:9|[Xia Meng], with a shaved head and holding a pair of scissors, gently touched [Xiong Dun]'s head to comfort her.
1:7:9|1:7:28|[Xiong Dun] pouted in grievance, although her tone was light, her heart was reluctant. She closed her eyes and imagined herself with long flowing hair, tossing a beautiful red curly hair, happily running on a grassland. [Xia Meng]'s skillful hands quickly transformed [Xiong Dun]'s hair into a short bob.
1:7:28|1:7:43|Cut-off stray hairs falling down one by one, lightly landing on the ground. [Xiong Dun] tightly closed his eyes, unable to help but start to imagine what he would look like with various hairstyles. It was as if at this moment of losing his hair, he suddenly realized that he had never taken good care of it.
1:7:43|1:7:56|In Xiong Dun's imagination, she switches between having elegant big waves, neat short hair, and handsome silver-gray hair. The imagined self is confident and beautiful, laughing happily and running forward.
1:7:56|1:8:5|The sunlight shines through the trees onto the grass, illuminating the bright and lively Xiong Dun, who in reality has grown up with short hair, resembling a young man.
1:8:5|1:8:21|Xiong Dun, who usually appears carefree, is not afraid of taking medicine, injections, or chemotherapy. However, when faced with the prospect of losing her hair, she becomes less relaxed and calm. In her imagination, Doctor Liang is standing in front of her, raising his hand to gently stroke her hair. There is a look of love in Doctor Liang's eyes.
1:8:23|1:8:30|[Xiong Dun] slowly opened his eyes, and in the mirror, he saw five bald heads, with [Lao Zheng], [Ai Mi], and [Xiao Xia].
1:8:45|1:8:55|In this way, [Xiong Dun], [Xia Meng], [Ai Mi], [Lao Zheng], and [Xiao Xia], all shaved their heads, and the five of them walked confidently on the street, not afraid of the eyes of the people around them.
1:8:55|1:9:15|They arrived at a bridal shop, looking at the various wedding dresses inside with excitement. [Xia Meng] was the first to pick a wedding dress to try on. As she lifted the curtain, everyone was amazed and opened their mouths wide. Looking at [Xia Meng] standing in front of them, elegant and noble in the wedding dress, even [Ai Mi] also put on a wedding dress and struck a sweet pose. Even the tomboy [Lao Zheng] wore a dress for the first time.
1:9:15|1:9:28|Later, [Xiong Dun] changed into a stylish wedding dress and playfully stuck out her tongue at [Lao Zheng] and the others. In the underground passage, a group of young people were singing and playing guitar. When [Xiong Dun] and her group passed by, they excitedly joined in and started dancing.
1:9:28|1:9:38|Later, the five of them arrived at a wig shop, ready to dress up. [Xiao Xia] took on the role of photographer, capturing their various strange outfits with her camera.
1:9:38|1:9:48|[Xiao Xia] was not content with just being a photographer, so she quickly ran forward and joined them, setting the camera timer. The five of them laughed heartily in front of the camera. As night fell, the five of them arrived at a high-end restaurant.
1:10:16|1:10:30|[Xiao Xia] finished using the restroom and was washing her hands at the sink when a man walked past behind her. Upon closer look, [Xiao Xia] realized that the man was actually Xiong Dun's ex-boyfriend, Xiao Chuan. Xiao Chuan was admiring himself in the mirror, running his greasy fingers through his hair and whistling, while [Xiao Xia] watched him thoughtfully.
1:10:36|1:10:43|[Ai Mi] paused with the bottle in her hand, shocked as she glanced at [Lao Zheng] beside her. She put down the bottle and looked around with [Lao Zheng].
1:10:52|1:10:58|[Xia Meng] raised the glass and took a sip, with a meaningful expression.
1:11:0|1:11:7|[Xia Meng] stood up, hugged the bewildered [Xiao Xia], and turned to leave. [Xia Meng] and [Xiao Xia] found a foreign waiter and the three of them huddled together, discussing something in low voices.
1:11:17|1:11:31|[Xia Meng] cautiously pushed open the door of the men's restroom. The waiter stood on either side of the door, watching out for her. [Xia Meng] slipped in, and the waiter pretended to be serious, crossing his arms and standing at the door. [Xia Meng] hid by the wall and looked into the restroom, finding it empty, so she walked in confidently.
1:12:35|1:12:40|Xiao Chuan's girlfriend looked at [Xiao Xia] with a mixture of belief and doubt, her face turning ugly. [Xiao Xia] continued speaking.
1:12:44|1:12:47|[Xiao Xia] showed an expression that was hard to describe, and Xiao Chuan's girlfriend was scared and lost her color.
1:12:47|1:13:3|On the phone, [Xiong Dun] was amused by [Xiao Xia]'s superb acting, while on the other side, [Xia Meng] walked out, squeezed a bunch of hand sanitizer into her hand, and while Xiao Chuan wasn't paying attention, [Xia Meng] smeared the hand sanitizer on Xiao Chuan's pants, revealing a malicious smile. Xiao Chuan widened his eyes, at a loss.
1:13:5|1:13:19|At this moment, Xiao Chuan's girlfriend completely believed Xiao Xia's words. With a murderous look in her eyes, she stood up and left her seat. Xia Meng walked out of the men's restroom and said to the waiter. The waiter nodded confidently and walked into the restroom.
1:13:19|1:13:28|Xiao Chuan's girlfriend marched aggressively towards the men's restroom, while Xiao Chuan was struggling to wash the hand sanitizer off his pants at the sink.
1:13:29|1:13:36|The waiter on the side was playing with his cuffs, teasingly smiling at Xiao Chuan. [Xia Meng] was deliberately making things difficult for Xiao Chuan's girlfriend at the door.
1:13:39|1:13:45|Xiao Chuan's girlfriend pushed [Xia Meng] aside and rushed into the men's restroom. [Xia Meng] disdainfully pursed her lips, shook her head, and walked away.
1:13:45|1:14:1|Xiao Chuan's girlfriend walked into the restroom and saw Xiao Chuan with the waitress. The waitress turned shyly to glance at Xiao Chuan's girlfriend, then turned back to Xiao Chuan, patted his butt, whispered "you naughty boy" in his ear, and left with a mischievous smile. As she walked away, she even bumped into Xiao Chuan's girlfriend's shoulder.
1:14:8|1:14:32|The girlfriend saw everything and no longer believed Xiao Chuan's explanation. The five of them walked out of the hotel door cheering and jumping with joy. Suddenly, everyone looked outside with a pleasantly surprised expression, their eyes shining. In just the time of a meal, heavy snowflakes began to fall outside, and a thick layer of snow covered the ground.
1:14:32|1:14:46|Everyone laughed and ran forward together, rushing into the heavy snow as if trying to shake off all the unhappiness of this period of time. She stood in the snow and started a snowball fight with [Ai Mi], [Lao Zheng], and [Xia Meng].
1:14:48|1:15:1|[Xiao Xia] stood at the door, watching the four of them playing around. She couldn't help but laugh, tears glistening in her eyes. But the next moment, she shouted and rushed into the snow, leaping down the steps and landing straight on the snow, using her hands to draw and pull the snow around her.
1:15:1|1:15:8|[Xiong Dun] and the sisters were playing around, throwing the snow in their hands towards [Xiao Xia]. The five of them were having a great time in this world of ice and snow.
1:15:20|1:15:31|[Xiong Dun] looked up at the sky, snowflakes falling on her face, hair, and scarf. She opened her arms, closed her eyes, and had a happy expression on her face, savoring the joy of the moment.
1:15:31|1:15:42|The scene fades into darkness, entering [Xiong Dun]'s nightmare. In the dream, [Xiong Dun] is wearing hospital clothes, panting heavily as she runs through a forest as if something is chasing her from behind.
1:15:42|1:15:50|Just then, in the mist of the forest, a zombie appeared. [Xiong Dun] was so frightened that he stumbled and fell, and at that moment, the heart rate monitor suddenly started to sound an alarm.
1:16:3|1:16:11|Xiong Dun's nightmare continues as the zombie lunges at her while she's lying on the ground, gnashing its teeth and gripping her neck. Xiong Dun struggles in pain.
1:16:20|1:16:30|Doctor Liang started to resuscitate Xiong Dun, while anxiously watching the electrocardiogram on the side. He put down the defibrillator and began performing CPR directly. Finally, a slight fluctuation appeared on the electrocardiogram.
1:16:38|1:16:54|[Doctor Liang] once again defibrillated [Xiong Dun], his eye sockets slightly reddened, looking anxious. However, every time he looked up, the ECG showed no response. He pounded on [Xiong Dun]'s chest with all his might, desperately trying to save his life. [Xiong Dun] was still trapped in her own nightmare, unable to break free, being choked by a zombie and unable to move.
1:16:54|1:17:11|In the dream, [Doctor Liang] held a crossbow, stood behind a tree not far away, aimed at the zombie's head, and shot. The zombie was hit in the forehead by the arrow, released its grip on [Xiong Dun]'s hand, rolled its eyes, and fell to the ground. [Doctor Liang] slowly put down the crossbow, and the rescued [Xiong Dun] kept coughing.
1:17:13|1:17:21|[Xiong Dun] sat up, breathing heavily in shock, looking at [Doctor Liang] in the distance. [Doctor Liang] looked at her and smiled.
1:17:28|1:17:40|[Doctor Liang] was panting, unable to even find his pen. The nurse beside him reminded him, and he took the pen down, but his hand trembled uncontrollably as he signed. The nurse beside him was also frightened by his appearance.
1:17:40|1:17:52|[Xiong Dun]'s condition has stabilized, lying on the nearby hospital bed. A nurse is holding an oxygen mask over her face to help her breathe. [Doctor Liang] hurriedly exits the emergency room, still trying to catch his breath.
1:17:52|1:17:58|He walked unsteadily in the corridor, his eyes unfocused, as if the one who had just experienced life and death was himself.
1:18:2|1:18:17|Finally, he pushed open the door of the bathroom and stumbled in. Inside, a man smoking a cigarette was startled by [Doctor Liang]. Ignoring the man's greeting, [Doctor Liang] quickly washed his face. He asked the man for a cigarette, wanting to ease the tension he had just experienced.
1:18:17|1:18:30|The usually dignified [Doctor Liang] has now turned into a disheveled middle-aged man. Leaning against the toilet door, [Doctor Liang] was smoking, but suddenly found it unbearable. He coughed, then immediately turned and rushed into the toilet cubicle, kneeling in front of the toilet, and started vomiting.
1:18:30|1:18:42|The man smoking was startled, standing cautiously at the door and asking. [Doctor Liang] quickly waved at him, indicating that everything was fine. The camera then shifted to the ward.
1:18:44|1:18:50|[Xia Meng] bites into an apple and asks the pale-faced [Xiong Dun]. [Xiong Dun] lies weakly on the bed, shaking his head.
1:19:10|1:19:22|[Xiong Dun] flashed a dreamy smile, turned her head to look at the ceiling, recalling the nightmare she just had. She imagined herself still in that forest, facing [Doctor Liang] who had saved her, standing still and locking eyes, sparking the flame of love.
1:19:34|1:19:42|[Xiong Dun] immediately turned her head to adjust her wig, holding an unfinished lollipop in her hand. [Doctor Liang] raised his hand to touch her head.
1:19:46|1:19:53|[Doctor Liang] smiled indulgently, as [Xiong Dun] asked. [Xiong Dun] extended an invitation to [Doctor Liang].
1:20:27|1:20:34|[Xiong Dun] said, looking at [Doctor Liang] with a proud expression on his face.
1:20:51|1:20:58|[Xiong Dun] looked at [Doctor Liang] beside him, and their eyes met. At that moment, [Doctor Liang]'s phone suddenly rang, displaying a message that said,
1:21:5|1:21:11|[Xiong Dun] took the disinfectant handed by [Doctor Liang] and rubbed his hands. He looked up and said to [Doctor Liang].
1:21:17|1:21:22|[Doctor Liang] smiled shyly as he let [Xiong Dun] apply hand cream on his hands.
1:21:24|1:21:30|[Doctor Liang] did not refuse and gladly accepted the gift from [Xiong Dun]. He stuffed the hand cream into his own pocket.
1:21:36|1:21:43|Doctor Liang did not answer her, just kept smiling. He suddenly looked up and gazed into the distance. Xiong Dun followed his gaze.
1:21:43|1:21:52|A group of nurses in the distance were seen standing together, sneakily watching Xiong Dun and Doctor Liang. Doctor Liang cleared his throat uncomfortably, patted Xiong Dun on the shoulder, and then turned and walked away.
1:21:58|1:22:11|[Xiong Dun] watched [Doctor Liang] walk away and started to daydream again. As [Doctor Liang] entered the elevator, the doors closed slowly. He saw his reflection on the side of the elevator doors and bent down to observe carefully. He remembered what [Xiong Dun] had once said to him,
1:22:11|1:22:25|He grinned and made faces in front of the mirror for no reason. Then he practiced his smile in front of the elevator door. Suddenly, the elevator door opened, and [Doctor Liang] immediately resumed a serious expression and walked out.
1:22:27|1:22:33|[Xiong Dun's Mother] stood outside the ward making a phone call with an anxious tone, then walked in with a worried look on her face.
1:23:7|1:23:22|[Xiong Dun] looked at his mother, feeling his heart sink instantly. The next day, [Xiong Dun] showed up at the door of [Doctor Liang]'s office with a bowl of dumplings in hand. He knocked carefully, but there was no response.
1:23:22|1:23:38|She had just placed the bowl of dumplings on Doctor Liang's table when voices could be heard outside the corridor. Xiong Dun quickly picked up the dumplings and hid in the corner of the office, drawing the curtain.
1:24:46|1:25:2|She took off her hat and wig without any hesitation, revealing her bald head. Finally, like an injured kitten, she lay on the bed with her back to Lao Zheng and the others. Doctor Liang's words were like a slap in the face, waking her up.
1:25:38|1:25:56|The scene shifts, [Xiong Dun] is alone on the street. She stands by a stall selling roasted sweet potatoes, holding a steaming hot sweet potato in her hand, eating it while staring into the distance. Back in the hospital room, she takes out the scarf she knitted for [Doctor Liang].
1:26:14|1:26:25|The atmosphere became awkward, [Doctor Liang] nodded slightly and then turned to leave. [Lao Zheng] and [Xiao Xia] helped [Xiong Dun] pack his bags to prepare for discharge. [Xiong Dun] couldn't help but look towards the door. At that moment, [Xia Meng] walked over and sat by the bed.
1:26:27|1:26:35|Hugging [Xiong Dun], he looked at [Xia Meng] and smiled.
1:26:41|1:26:49|[Doctor Liang] and a nurse were talking about something as they walked by. [Xiao Xia] and [Lao Zheng] waved enthusiastically at [Doctor Liang], who waved back in response.
1:26:52|1:27:2|[Xiong Dun] coldly glanced at him, then quickly looked away and turned his gaze elsewhere. [Doctor Liang] didn't know why [Xiong Dun] was ignoring him, stood there foolishly, watching them leave.
1:27:2|1:27:17|[Xiong Dun] and his group entered the elevator, with [Doctor Liang] not far away, looking at [Xiong Dun]. When he saw [Xiong Dun] raise her head, he quickly waved at her, trying hard to get her response. The elevator door was about to close, but [Xiong Dun] just looked at him, her eyes full of resentment and reluctance.
1:27:17|1:27:32|[Xiong Dun] was deeply hurt by the words she heard in [Doctor Liang]'s office, stubbornly believing that [Doctor Liang] only saw her as a regular patient. That night, [Lao Zheng] drove the car with [Xiao Xia] sitting in the passenger seat, while [Xiong Dun] sat alone in the back seat.
1:27:32|1:27:39|She leaned against the window, chin in hand, enjoying the long-lost night view, her gaze drawn to the person on the street holding a red balloon.
1:28:8|1:28:16|At this moment, [Xiong Dun] barged in with [Lao Zheng] and [Xiao Xia], ignoring the security guard at the door. Do you speak Chinese?
1:29:8|1:29:13|In the corridor, [Xiong Dun] held [Xiao Xia]'s arm and listened silently to [Ai Mi]'s accusations.
1:29:47|1:29:54|[Xiong Dun] looked at [Ai Mi] with red eyes, unbelievably. She suppressed her grievances and anger, turned around without looking back, and quickly walked away.
1:30:3|1:30:16|At that moment, only [Ai Mi] was left in the hallway, standing still. Back at home, [Ai Mi] was alone packing her luggage, while [Xiong Dun] was in another room holding a doll, lying on the bed drawing, listening to [Ai Mi]'s movements.
1:30:16|1:30:25|[Ai Mi] pulled the suitcase and stopped at the door of [Xiong Dun]'s room, reaching out to knock. [Xiong Dun] put down the paintbrush, sitting up excitedly.
1:30:25|1:30:38|Xiong Dun waited expectantly for Ai Mi's next move, but Ai Mi hesitated, put her hand down, picked up her luggage, and left. Xiong Dun heard Ai Mi leaving, her expression gradually becoming lost. She looked serious, as if she had made a decision.
1:30:38|1:31:0|Picking up the phone and dialing, she had a mournful face as she put the phone to her ear. In the blink of an eye, the plane landed. [Xiong Dun] returned home, where his parents had prepared a feast to welcome him back. The whole family sat around the table happily raising their glasses, while [Xiong Dun] sat in the middle absentmindedly.
1:31:0|1:31:11|She forced a smile to accompany her family, trying to make herself happy. She started exercising, wrapping herself up tightly, wearing a cotton hat and gloves, hanging earphones, and going out for a morning run early in the morning.
1:31:11|1:31:23|She returned home and saw the door frame covered with wood grain, marking her childhood height. She couldn't help but reach out to touch it, lost in thought. She then found her childhood pencil case, filled with various erasers and small toys.
1:31:23|1:31:38|She took out an old cassette tape, with "Michael Jackson" written on it. After flipping through it, she took out a strawberry-shaped eraser from the box, placed it under her nose, and then under the desk lamp, where it emitted a faint light. While [Xiong Dun's Mother] was preparing the meal,
1:31:38|1:31:46|Turning her head with a smile, she looked at [Xiong Dun]. [Xiong Dun] stood by the door, measured her current height, and wrote down, 29 years old. Shortly after, she returned to Beijing.
1:31:54|1:32:10|[Xiao Xia], [Lao Zheng], and [Xia Meng], holding flowers, congratulated [Xiong Dun] on his return. The room was filled with balloons, ribbons, and colorful paper. [Xiong Dun] embraced his friends with a happy smile on his face. Everyone's life has returned to normal, even [Xia Meng] has started her career as a model.
1:32:10|1:32:18|At this moment, [Ai Mi] was sitting alone in a small restaurant in Japan, looking vacant, while [Xiong Dun] absentmindedly lay on the table drawing.
1:32:21|1:32:35|She opened the email, it was an animated video made by [Xiong Dun]. In the video, the little girl with the same hairstyle as [Xiong Dun] was beaten by a cactus and a stick in turns, lying on the ground crying, with the words written above, "I can have my heart broken 10 times, but I can't lose you once."
1:32:36|1:32:43|[Ai Mi] had tears in her eyes, revealing a long-lost smile. [Xiong Dun] leaned against the window, with a solemn face, waiting for [Ai Mi]'s reply.
1:32:45|1:32:58|She picked up her phone, and [Ai Mi] replied to her, "You better live well for me." Reading this message, [Xiong Dun] felt a sudden sense of relief. With tears in her eyes, she held the phone close to her chest. The two good friends thus untied the knot in their hearts.
1:32:58|1:33:7|The scene cuts to [Xiong Dun] lying on the bed drawing cartoons, suddenly, he starts coughing violently.
1:33:17|1:33:35|The constant coughing made it difficult for her to breathe. She staggered to her feet and walked towards the living room. Gradually losing her balance, she leaned over the shelf holding the fish tank. The shelf swayed under her weight, and soon couldn't hold on. It toppled to the ground, sending the fish tank crashing down.
1:33:35|1:33:47|The fish tank shattered on the ground, Xiong Dun began to feel weak and lost consciousness. At this moment, Lao Zheng rushed in, grabbed the almost falling Xiong Dun, Xiong Dun glanced at Lao Zheng, then closed his eyes and passed out.
1:33:47|1:33:56|[Lao Zheng] kept shouting [Xiong Dun]'s name loudly, but [Xiong Dun] couldn't hear. The scene transitioned to a black screen, and then [Xiong Dun] was once again taken to the hospital.
1:33:56|1:34:11|In the hospital corridor, [Xiong Dun's Father], [Xiong Dun's Mother], and [Lao Zheng] sit on chairs, while [Xiao Xia] stands silently by the wall. All four of them are anxiously waiting for [Xiong Dun] in the emergency room. [Xiong Dun's Mother] is huddled in the chair, unable to hold back her tears. Inside the ward,
1:34:11|1:34:28|[Xiong Dun] lay on the hospital bed, unconscious, while [Doctor Liang] fiddled with the chemotherapy equipment beside the bed. At that moment, [Xiong Dun] opened his eyes, enduring fatigue and pain, and looked at [Doctor Liang] in front of him, saying.
1:35:8|1:35:24|[Doctor Liang] smiled and reached out his hand to signal [Xiong Dun] to fist bump with him. [Xiong Dun] weakly raised his arm and extended his fingers towards [Doctor Liang], a smile appearing on his pale face. [Doctor Liang] looked at [Xiong Dun] with a smile on his face.
1:35:26|1:35:40|[Doctor Liang] finished speaking and then turned to continue working busily. [Xiong Dun] weakly opened his eyes, but his gaze kept following [Doctor Liang]. While [Doctor Liang] was busy recording data, [Xiong Dun] was busy observing him. As he watched, [Xiong Dun] fell asleep with a satisfied smile.
1:35:40|1:35:53|Shortly after, [Xiong Dun] was pushed into the MRI room for examination. [Doctor Liang] and another doctor were outside observing the imaging on the computer. [Doctor Liang] furrowed his brow, looking at the computer screen, then worriedly raised his head, gazing through the glass at [Xiong Dun] inside.
1:35:54|1:36:2|The scene cuts back to the hospital room, where Doctor Liang is flipping through Xiong Dun's sketchbook. In the sketchbook, Xiong Dun has drawn Doctor Liang with remarkable accuracy.
1:36:2|1:36:16|With his serious and unsmiling demeanor, as well as his exhausted look leaning against his forehead while sleeping, [Doctor Liang] turned his head to glance at [Xiong Dun] lying on the hospital bed, sitting cautiously on a stool. [Xiong Dun] slept restlessly, breathing heavily, occasionally tossing and turning.
1:36:16|1:36:25|[Doctor Liang] watched her attentively, paying attention to her every move, while continuing to flip through her sketchbook. The sketchbook featured balloons and little figures again. After admiring the drawings, [Doctor Liang]
1:36:26|1:36:44|He lovingly touched the cover of the brochure, then turned and placed it on the bedside table. [Xiong Dun] gradually woke up and noticed someone beside her. She saw [Doctor Liang] and immediately smiled happily.
1:37:6|1:37:16|Upon hearing Xiong Dun's words, Doctor Liang fell silent. Xiong Dun noticed this.
1:37:19|1:37:31|Doctor Liang glanced at the handbag filled with balls of yarn and handed it to Xiong Dun.
1:38:22|1:38:31|[Xiong Dun], with red eyes and a choked voice, gathered up the courage to ask this question.
1:39:15|1:39:31|Doctor Liang's voice trembled uncontrollably, tears swirling in his eyes. Upon hearing this answer, Xiong Dun's tears welled up.
1:40:48|1:40:57|Upon hearing Xiong Dun's words, Doctor Liang fought back tears and nodded slightly.
1:41:20|1:41:37|The two people who opened their hearts are no longer holding back at this moment, laughing heartily. [Xiong Dun] bites his lip, looking at [Doctor Liang] with joy in his eyes. Doctor Liang is the same, never before has he laughed so openly. The next day, [Xiong Dun] sits on the bed, watching a boxing match with [Xiao Xia] featuring [Lao Zheng].
1:42:15|1:42:24|[Xiong Dun] is standing on the stage in a beautiful dance costume. She is holding the hem of her skirt and gesturing a beautiful dance move.
1:43:11|1:43:28|[Xiong Dun] is dressed in travel gear, carrying a large backpack, looking at the colorful and magnificent aurora in front of him. The ever-changing beautiful light bands streak across the night sky, mysterious and dreamlike. Finally, [Xiong Dun] climbs to the top of a mountain.
1:43:30|1:43:43|The rising sun cast a golden hue over the mountains, enveloping [Xiong Dun] in sunlight. [Xiong Dun] gazed into the distance, his eyes sparkling with a longing for life.
1:43:43|1:43:57|Even if fate played a huge joke on her, [Xiong Dun] managed to turn it into motivation. She boldly pursued her dreams, love, and everything she was passionate about, living vividly and passionately. As the scene shifts,
1:43:57|1:44:10|[Xiong Dun] nestled in his mother's arms, his mother wearing reading glasses, knitting a sweater. Suddenly, he reached out and touched his mother's lips, his mother smiled kindly, and [Xiong Dun] also smiled, saying.
1:44:14|1:44:21|His mother smiled indulgently and said.
1:44:38|1:44:44|The two exchanged a smile, and Mom adjusted her reading glasses, knitting a sweater with her hands.
1:45:2|1:45:8|Mom's eyes suddenly turned red, she said to [Xiong Dun].
1:45:13|1:45:27|[Xiong Dun] obediently agreed, and his mother lowered her head to touch [Xiong Dun]'s shoulder with concern. [Xiong Dun] stared at his mother, pouting with a sense of grievance, his eyes red, mustering up the courage to speak. His mother, holding back tears, kept her eyes down and did not look at him.
1:45:28|1:45:32|[Xiong Dun] restrained his emotions, tears shimmering in his eyes as he spoke.
1:45:44|1:45:50|Hearing these words, Mom couldn't control her tears anymore, sobbing uncontrollably. [Xiong Dun] continued.
1:46:19|1:46:25|[Xiong Dun]'s mother's mouth kept twitching, reaching out to hold [Xiong Dun] even tighter.
1:46:26|1:46:31|The mother and daughter held each other tightly, releasing all the painful emotions.
1:46:34|1:46:53|[Xiong Dun] buried her head deeply in her mother's arms, sobbing like a child. Since falling ill, it was the first time [Xiong Dun] cried out loud without any care. At this moment, [Xiong Dun] realized that the greatest torment the illness brought her was the separation from her family.
1:46:53|1:47:13|In the city, everything remains the same, factory chimneys billowing thick smoke. Vehicles on the streets come and go incessantly, no matter how tough life is, the world keeps on turning. No matter what life throws at her, [Xiong Dun] always manages to smile and face it without being defeated. Even when life tosses her around, ups and downs,
1:47:13|1:47:29|She can also stand up and resist stubbornly. The scene shifts to the hospital, where [Doctor Liang] opens the drawer in the office and puts the file in his hand inside. He suddenly notices the hand cream in the corner of the drawer, picks it up and looks at it, remembering that it was a gift from [Xiong Dun].
1:47:29|1:47:42|He held it in his hand, turning it over and over, lost in thought. Xiong Dun's condition was better understood by him than anyone else, but the sudden deterioration caught everyone off guard. He couldn't control his tears and started crying.
1:47:42|1:47:59|With his hands covering his eyes, letting tears slide down his fingers, he decided to take off his glasses and sobbed with his nose covered. At night, [Xiong Dun] stood on the rooftop, wearing a hat, gloves, and a scarf. She listlessly exhaled white mist into the air, feeling the cold of this winter.
1:47:59|1:48:8|A gust of wind blew a plastic bag onto the rooftop, flying past [Xiong Dun] and eventually hanging on the railing, making a rustling sound in the wind.
1:48:8|1:48:21|[Xiong Dun] walked over and rescued the struggling plastic bag from the railing, then threw it into the sky. It flew further and further with the wind, eventually becoming a small dot. [Xiong Dun] stood still, watching the plastic bag fly away.
1:48:21|1:48:34|It's as if the one who just regained freedom is [Xiong Dun] himself. [Xiong Dun]'s condition is getting worse, and everyone is busy with their own tasks. [Xiao Xia] is busy working, turning into a workaholic, standing in the conference room, confidently presenting the plan to everyone.
1:48:34|1:48:39|[Xia Meng] is dressed in a handsome suit, standing in front of the spotlight and camera.
1:48:40|1:48:58|[Xiong Dun's Mother] sat in front of the hospital bed, tears in her eyes as she looked at [Xiong Dun] and nodded at her. [Xiong Dun] knew she was running out of time, so she forced a smile at her mother. [Xiong Dun's Mother] understood that her daughter was bidding her final farewell, and she held back her tears, unable to hide the pain and sorrow.
1:48:58|1:49:7|Xiao Xia, who is in a meeting at the company, suddenly seems to sense something and stops her actions. Lao Zheng, who is in the middle of a boxing match with his opponent, suddenly becomes distracted.
1:49:9|1:49:26|The opponent took advantage of the opening and landed a punch on her face. She closed her eyes in pain and fell backwards. The back of her head hit the ground heavily on the boxing ring. Sweat from her hair scattered on the floor. Filming [Xia Meng], she stood still in a daze as if her soul had left her body.
1:49:26|1:49:38|Just back from a business trip, [Ai Mi] sat in the car and suddenly looked up to see a red balloon floating in the sky. It was light and inconspicuous, drifting wherever the wind blew it.
1:49:38|1:49:51|It was as if they had a telepathic connection, sensing [Xiong Dun]'s call in his final moments. [Ai Mi] carried bags and ran down the hospital corridor. As she approached the door of [Xiong Dun]'s ward, she involuntarily slowed down.
1:49:51|1:50:5|She slowly walked forward, only to see the scene she least wanted to see. The devastated look on [Xiong Dun's Parents], and the heart monitor next to them flatlining, announced [Xiong Dun]'s departure. The things in [Ai Mi]'s hands instantly scattered on the ground.
1:50:5|1:50:21|The sunflower plush toy previously given to [Xiong Dun] fell to the ground, still playing [Xiong Dun]'s song. [Ai Mi] sat down, hesitating to enter the ward. She bit her finger, tears streaming down her face silently. The scene then shifted to [Xiong Dun]'s funeral.
1:50:21|1:50:28|The projector on the wall displays a cartoon image based on [Xiong Dun], with the words "Xiong, we miss you" written in a cute font below.
1:50:29|1:50:37|[Xiao Xia] stood on the stage, bowed to the audience below, and said.
1:50:47|1:50:52|[Xiao Xia] turned around and turned on the projector behind her.
1:51:6|1:51:12|[Xiong Dun] couldn't control his tears and stopped.
1:51:42|1:51:59|[Xiong Dun] turned her head, trying hard to hold back her tears. She then used her hand to cover her face, afraid that tears would fall, but the tears still stubbornly rolled down. She had to use her hand to wipe them away. Sitting in the audience, [Xiong Dun's Mother] also shed tears silently along with [Xiong Dun]. After wiping away her tears,
1:51:59|1:52:2|Struggling to control her emotions and trembling voice.
1:52:15|1:52:22|[Xiong Dun] puts his hands together. [Xiong Dun's Father] couldn't help but cry.
1:53:20|1:53:25|[Xiong Dun] covered her nose, tears streaming down again. She sniffed and forced a smile, saying.
1:53:29|1:53:35|[Xiong Dun] laughed and cried at the same time, facing the camera, making a big scissor gesture with his hand.
