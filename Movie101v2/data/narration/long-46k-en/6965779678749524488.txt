0:2:41|0:2:45|Everyone looked disappointed, except for one person who couldn't stop laughing.
0:3:19|0:3:26|The female tourist put the gnawed chicken wing back, while one of the tourists laughed happily beside her.
0:4:12|0:4:38|A tattered wooden door was opened, and everyone curiously gathered around, stepping into the room one by one. In a bathtub filled with water floated some green plants. People gradually approached the bathtub and then saw a person with golden hair gradually floating up from the bottom of the tub. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be the curator who had just dressed up as a mermaid, sitting up from the bathtub.
0:4:38|0:4:49|Tourists, with terrified expressions, all leaned back in unison. [Liu Xuan], with exaggerated golden hair on top of his head and wearing a cheap fake fishtail, sat by the bathtub striking a seductive pose.
0:4:52|0:5:4|A tourist looked at the curator dressed as a mermaid and laughed so hard that his heart condition acted up. The tourists looked speechlessly at the fake mermaid in the bathtub.
0:5:28|0:5:38|The scene shifts to an auction, where everyone is bidding for the Qingluo Bay. People are raising their paddles one after another, and the auction price keeps rising.
0:6:14|0:6:33|A luxurious red sports car is driving on an empty road, then pulls into a round mansion. The car drifts to a stop in the courtyard, and a sexy woman with a voluptuous figure and red high heels steps out of the car as the black-clad bodyguards open the door for her.
0:6:33|0:6:40|This beauty is the famous female tycoon [Li Ruolan], followed by a group of bodyguards running ahead to clear the way for a red luxury car.
0:6:40|0:6:57|A black luxury car slowly drove into the courtyard, with the guards quickly splitting into two rows and standing in position as the car doors opened. [Li Ruolan]'s father, Fourth Master, stepped out of the car with a smile on his face, followed by a guard who whistled, prompting the rest of the guards to form a circle as instructed.
0:6:57|0:7:13|Zheng Zong, dressed in leopard print attire, descends from the sky with a flying apparatus on his back. Several bodyguards quickly surround him to help him unload his equipment. The mansion is brightly lit, with maids each performing their duties in their respective positions. A group of wealthy elites stride down the steps together, exuding an imposing aura.
0:7:14|0:7:27|The owner of the mansion, [Liu Xuan], stood inside the house, watching the wealthy guests approaching closer and closer. He took a few steps forward, smiled, opened his arms, and welcomed everyone who came to visit.
0:10:11|0:10:28|Liu Xuan handed the stamped paper to General Zheng, Brother Ba and Li Ruolan widened their eyes at the same time, but Liu Xuan remained indifferent. After General Zheng put on his glasses and finished reading, he forcefully tossed the approval to the side.
0:10:54|0:11:6|[Liu Xuan] opened a bottle of champagne, and the cork suddenly popped onto the switch of Director Zheng's aircraft. Director Zheng's body then flew off the ground towards the second floor, hit the wall, and fell to the ground again.
0:11:37|0:12:5|Liu Xuan pretended to shake hands with the Fourth Prince, dodged his hand, and then patted him on the shoulder. The Fourth Prince stood there stunned with his hand still outstretched. The scene then shifted to the party by the pool, where many guests gathered. Several beautiful women dressed as mermaids danced to the music. Suddenly, Li Ruolan's appearance caught everyone's attention, and all the men at the scene flocked to her.
0:12:5|0:12:28|However, Li Ruolan ignored them and walked directly towards Liu Xuan. At that moment, Liu Xuan was surrounded by many beautiful women in his convertible. Li Ruolan stopped by Liu Xuan's luxury car, took off her watch, and threw it into the swimming pool in front of everyone.
0:12:36|0:12:43|The beauties immediately got up and jumped out of the pool to search for the watch.
0:13:40|0:13:49|[Liu Xuan] looked at [Li Ruolan] in front of him, pulled her into his arms, gazed at her for a moment, and then kissed her on the lips.
0:13:54|0:14:10|[Liu Xuan] and [Li Ruolan] reached an agreement, preparing to kiss again. [Shan Shan], with heavy makeup on, suddenly interrupted the two who were about to kiss. The bodyguard pushed [Shan Shan] away and then threw her to the ground with a shoulder throw.
0:14:22|0:14:26|[Li Ruolan] has no lingering feelings for [Liu Xuan] and walks away without looking back.
0:15:2|0:15:26|[Liu Xuan] turned around and saw [Shan Shan] wearing an extravagant fake fishtail, bouncing step by step outward. The scene shifted from the party to the street, with [Shan Shan] carrying a large backpack and skateboarding on the road. She skated to a bustling food street, placed her backpack and skateboard on a bucket at a roast chicken shop, and stared intently at the chef holding the just-out-of-the-oven roast chicken.
0:15:30|0:15:36|[Shan Shan] personally cooked the fairy chicken in the stove, then sat at the table and ate heartily.
0:15:42|0:16:4|[Shan Shan] rode her skateboard alone on the road by the sea, as the sky grew brighter. She stopped, jumped off the skateboard, took out a yogurt drink, took a few sips, and looked up at the house on the hilltop. The small house was empty. [Shan Shan] rode her skateboard into the house, bypassed the furniture, and then lifted the iron plate on the floor.
0:16:4|0:16:15|Shan Shan stood on the skateboard again, slid down the tunnel hidden under the iron plate, the environment inside the tunnel was extremely damp and the road was muddy and difficult to navigate.
0:16:16|0:16:42|[Shan Shan] rode a skateboard across a waterfall and stopped on an old, rusty ship. The ship was docked in a deserted area, [Shan Shan] slowly moved the skateboard to the side of a hole in the middle of the ship, then jumped into the u-shaped pool in the cabin and slid back and forth several times. After that, she jumped from the u-shaped pool to the central trampoline, and finally used the trampoline's bounce to jump onto a nearby wooden plank.
0:16:44|0:17:12|She stood firm, took off the backpack from her back, turned her head to look at the old lady by the pool, the old lady was resting on the side of the iron bucket with one hand supporting her head, [Shan Shan] did not say anything, but took small steps forward, moving towards a bathtub with seaweed floating in it. A child sat up from the bottom of the bathtub, smiled at [Shan Shan], and the child's small body was covered with grim wounds.
0:17:12|0:17:23|[Shan Shan] looked at the child, then picked up a bottle of medicine from the ground and poured some into the bathtub. The child, with a smile on his face, turned around and buried his head in the bathtub, and a large tail jumped out of the water.
0:17:45|0:17:59|The scene shifts to an office, where a commercial for Haichang Holdings Limited is playing on the TV.
0:18:54|0:19:2|The Japanese female assistant pressed the switch on the remote control, and a metal device reached into the fish tank. The goldfish inside the tank thrashed around, then suddenly its body exploded.
0:19:8|0:19:14|[Li Ruolan] handed her phone to the female assistant next to her, who took a few photos of the fish tank.
0:19:42|0:19:59|The camera gradually zooms in on the model of Qingluo Bay, then transitions to the actual Qingluo Bay. [Shan Shan] stands in the dilapidated cabin, unzips the tracksuit she is wearing, takes it off and casually throws it aside. Then she moves forward, dragging down the two skirts around her waist.
0:19:59|0:20:23|The tightly wrapped fish tail was suddenly exposed, and [Shan Shan] jumped out of her shoes, slowly shaking off the socks wrapped around her fins. She leaped from the floor into the water, where many mermaids like [Shan Shan] were hidden. Everyone danced and sang freely in the water. [Shan Shan] emerged from the water.
0:20:23|0:20:33|Many mermaids, like her, also surfaced with their heads, all looking in the same direction, where sat an old mermaid granny with white hair.
0:20:51|0:20:57|The grandmother danced with her colorful tail, creating a flying monkey soaring upwards.
0:21:38|0:21:48|Grandma's tail flicked again, and the water splashed into a plane flying forward. The plane flew over the mermaids' heads and then dropped a bomb with a roar.
0:21:52|0:21:57|The shell fell into the water, creating a huge splash, scattering water droplets.
0:22:6|0:22:13|After saying these two words, [Ma Dongmei] fell silent and stared blankly to the side.
0:23:12|0:23:20|[Brother Ba] swam through the water and then emerged on the side. The other mermaids formed a circle around him.
0:23:40|0:23:46|[Brother Ba] took out a bottle of wine from behind and took a sip.
0:24:30|0:24:44|[Brother Ba] came to [Shan Shan], embraced her, and kissed her on the lips. The two embraced in the water, seeming deeply engrossed in the kiss. [Brother Ba] then took a step back and gazed affectionately at [Shan Shan].
0:25:21|0:25:29|[Liu Xuan] knelt in front of [Li Ruolan], sat on her sofa, and started playfully wrestling with her hand.
0:25:38|0:25:44|The scene shifts back to the dilapidated cabin, where the mermaids gather around a cellphone on the floor.
0:26:51|0:27:8|Liu Xuan remained silent for a long time after hearing Li Ruolan's mockery. Meanwhile, the phone finally rang as the mermaids eagerly anticipated it. Shan Shan picked up the phone.
0:27:37|0:27:43|[Liu Xuan] stood up gracefully, threw his clothes back, and walked out without looking back.
0:27:50|0:28:5|On the other side, the mermaids were very excited when they learned that [Liu Xuan] was coming. They used the catapult on the ship to launch the octopus and [Shan Shan] out of the cabin. They passed through the turbulent waterfall one after another and crashed into the large swim ring hanging on the wall.
0:28:6|0:28:26|Following that, other mermaids also arrived in the cave through the launching device. The octopus, Brother Ba, proudly manipulated its tentacles and walked forward. The mermaids followed it, jumping and hopping. The octopus lifted the lid on the ground, moved step by step, and then sat in the hut, its tentacles holding various weapons.
0:28:26|0:28:39|Liu Xuan's luxury car is now parked at the foot of the mountain. He gets out of the car and looks into the distance, completely unaware of what is about to happen next. The mermaids and octopus are already fully armed inside the house, waiting for Liu Xuan to arrive.
0:28:39|0:29:7|Brother Ba climbed agilely to the ceiling with his weapon, [Shan Shan] moved her fish tail step by step to the door. She looked back at the octopus on the roof, who nodded at her. Seeing this, [Shan Shan] also nodded, and in a blink of an eye, she changed into a white dress and walked to the door of the cabin. Standing in front of the door with her hands on her hips, she smiled and struck a seductive pose, only to find out that the person outside the door was not Liu Xuan.
0:29:10|0:29:30|Inside the house, the octopus saw [Shan Shan] being taken away by three black-clad bodyguards. He quickly opened the door, put a bag on his back, and rushed outside anxiously. He struggled through the grass and then stopped in front of [Shan Shan] before she got into the car. [Shan Shan] saw the octopus and hurried towards him.
0:29:39|0:29:55|[Shan Shan] took the backpack from Octopus's hands, then turned and got into the car with the bodyguard. The bodyguard stepped on Octopus's exposed tentacle, took out a small knife from his pocket,
0:30:48|0:31:2|The bodyguard returned the octopus's legs to the octopus, then drove away. [Shan Shan] was taken to a high-end hotel by the bodyguard. She sat in a chair, frowning, while the female assistant placed two glasses of water on the table and then left.
0:31:2|0:31:14|Shan Shan saw the female assistant leave, quickly turned around and took out a green plant, squeezed out a drop of juice into the cup, the juice dissipated in the water, Shan Shan pushed the cup of water towards the opposite side.
0:31:14|0:31:37|She was about to bring over another glass of water when [Liu Xuan]'s male assistant sat down, startling [Shan Shan]. The assistant looked at the two glasses of water in front of him and set them aside. [Shan Shan] nervously stood up next to the chair, while the bodyguard scanned her from head to toe with a scanner. [Shan Shan] tightly held the hem of her skirt, not daring to move.
0:31:37|0:31:43|When the scanner suddenly beeped as it scanned the foot,
0:31:52|0:32:9|The burly bodyguard took a step forward, looking down at [Shan Shan]. Startled, [Shan Shan] took a step back and sat down on the chair. The male assistant pointed to the table with his index finger, and [Shan Shan] frowned as she slowly lifted her foot and placed it on the table. The male bodyguard placed the scanner aside, reached out, and untied her shoelace.
0:32:9|0:32:22|Shan Shan watched the male bodyguard's movements, her expression becoming more and more frightened. The male assistant interrupted the bodyguard, then pulled out a nail from Shan Shan's shoe sole. The bodyguard picked up a scanner and scanned the nail.
0:32:26|0:32:43|[Shan Shan] breathed a sigh of relief instantly. The bodyguard casually opened Shan Shan's large backpack, while the male assistant pulled out a black ball covered in spikes with a puzzled expression. Then, the male assistant took out something resembling a dagger. Shan Shan hesitated for a moment.
0:33:30|0:33:48|[Shan Shan] and the male assistant each drank the water in their hands, then placed the cups on the table. The two looked at each other, and [Shan Shan]'s expression became increasingly strange and fierce, with all her features wrinkled together. Then she took out a piece of lemon from her mouth.
0:33:59|0:34:8|The male assistant foamed at the mouth and collapsed on the ground. [Shan Shan] picked up a bottle of alcohol and poured it into his mouth.
0:34:17|0:34:24|The male assistant finished the water handed to him by the bodyguard, then collapsed on the ground again. At that moment, [Shan Shan] suddenly saw [Liu Xuan] walking out from the side.
0:34:38|0:34:58|[Liu Xuan] slapped his subordinate, then stood in front of the mirror and touched his beard. [Shan Shan] turned around to dodge, then continued to follow [Liu Xuan]. [Liu Xuan] made a phone call by the glass, while [Shan Shan] hurriedly hid on the side, afraid of being discovered by him.
0:35:2|0:35:40|[Liu Xuan] walked forward while talking on the phone. [Shan Shan] took the opportunity to follow him closely when no one was around. She peeked inside quietly and found no one there. The office was decorated very luxuriously. As [Shan Shan] walked in, she put on gloves and took out a sea urchin covered with spines, took a deep breath, and prepared to throw it at [Liu Xuan]. Not only did [Shan Shan] fail to hit [Liu Xuan], but she was also hit several times by things thrown out by him.
0:35:45|0:36:11|[Shan Shan] sneaked out from under the table, ready to attack him again. The sea urchin she threw bounced back and stabbed Shan Shan in the head. She endured the pain and prepared to attack Liu Xuan again. Shan Shan's second attack was disrupted by a repairman, but she still ended up stabbing herself in the face with the sea urchin.
0:36:12|0:36:35|[Shan Shan] rolled her eyes, foamed at the mouth and fell to the ground. She looked at [Liu Xuan] in front of her, struggled to get up, then shook her head and crawled forward with all her strength. Immediately, [Shan Shan] raised a dagger trying to stab [Liu Xuan]'s foot, but [Liu Xuan] started dancing to the music. Every dodge of [Liu Xuan] was just right to avoid [Shan Shan]'s attacks.
0:38:34|0:38:41|[Liu Xuan] was frightened by [Shan Shan]'s words and almost fell to the ground.
0:38:53|0:38:59|[Liu Xuan] suddenly stopped in his tracks, turned around, and walked back to [Shan Shan]. He reached out and took off the hairband from [Shan Shan]'s head.
0:39:48|0:40:2|The male assistant and three bodyguards rolled on the ground together, while [Liu Xuan] and [Shan Shan] sat in the car facing each other. [Shan Shan] flirted desperately on the side, but [Liu Xuan] took out a stack of money and threw it at her.
0:40:23|0:40:52|The luxury car slowly stopped by the roadside, [Shan Shan] got out of the car, and [Liu Xuan] quickly closed the door. Angrily, [Liu Xuan] kicked the driver, who quickly started the car. The scene shifted to the market, where [Shan Shan] took a roasted fat chicken and turned around to look for [Liu Xuan]. She looked around in confusion, but there was no sign of [Liu Xuan] anywhere.
0:40:53|0:40:59|At that moment, [Liu Xuan] suddenly walked towards her with his hands on his waist and accompanied by bodyguards.
0:41:20|0:41:41|[Liu Xuan], who was full of resistance a second ago, turned around and started eating roast chicken with [Shan Shan]. The two of them ate one roast chicken after another at the table, with chicken bones piling up like a mountain. As the sky gradually darkened, [Liu Xuan] suddenly slowed down his eating speed, stopped chewing, and soon sat on the side, his face collapsed, silently crying.
0:42:6|0:42:13|[Liu Xuan] raised the leftover chicken leg in his hand, watching it choke continuously.
0:42:15|0:42:29|[Shan Shan] picked up a tissue and wiped away the tears for [Liu Xuan]. [Liu Xuan] turned his head to look at Shan Shan, who was helping him wipe his tears, waved at her, then sniffed and chewed on the chicken in his mouth.
0:42:32|0:42:38|[Shan Shan] continued to raise her hand to help [Liu Xuan] wipe his mouth, and [Liu Xuan] seemed to be startled by [Shan Shan]'s actions.
0:43:8|0:43:42|He stared blankly at Shan Shan in front of him, not saying a word for a long time. He took out a pen, and a bodyguard brought him a check. Liu Xuan put down the check and stood up to leave. Shan Shan picked up the check on the table and walked towards the fireplace. Liu Xuan suddenly stopped in his tracks, turned around, and watched as Shan Shan threw the one million check into the fire, burning it instantly. Seeing this, he immediately turned back and sat with Shan Shan at the table where they had just eaten chicken.
0:45:59|0:46:18|Liu Xuan turned around and started playing spaceship with Shan Shan. Their voices were getting louder and louder as they played many games together, even fishing for ping pong balls and riding the mini train with the children. They were very happy, laughing loudly, while the bodyguards stood not far away watching the boss having a great time.
0:46:19|0:46:29|[Liu Xuan] and [Shan Shan] were dizzy from the big turntable, lying on it and vomiting everywhere.
0:46:59|0:47:37|Shan Shan's smile froze on her face, Liu Xuan looked at her with a raised eyebrow, it turned out the call was from Brother Ba. At this moment, Brother Ba, holding a weapon, was squatting in the house with other merfolk. Liu Xuan accompanied Shan Shan towards the direction of the cabin. Shan Shan accidentally stumbled, and Liu Xuan quickly caught her, then grabbed Shan Shan's arm. Liu Xuan's hand gradually slipped from Shan Shan's arm.
0:47:37|0:48:7|Moving her hand to his, [Shan Shan] glanced at it, [Liu Xuan] held her hand and then looked at her, the two of them walked side by side with fingers intertwined. Inside the cabin, danger lurked as [Brother Ba] and the mermaid held weapons, ready to strike. [Shan Shan] took steps towards the cabin, then turned back and playfully flipped her hair at [Liu Xuan], who looked back at her and agreed without hesitation.
0:48:8|0:48:22|[Liu Xuan] followed [Shan Shan] towards the cabin. [Shan Shan] lowered her head and took out a key from her bag, inserting it into the lock. [Brother Ba] was on the wall holding a weapon, waiting for [Liu Xuan]. Just then, [Shan Shan] suddenly hesitated.
0:48:32|0:48:49|[Shan Shan] listened to [Liu Xuan]'s love words, slowly took off her backpack from her shoulder, then slowly unbuttoned her clothes, standing naked with a blank expression, looking at [Liu Xuan]. [Liu Xuan] was stunned by [Shan Shan]'s actions, as the breeze gently moved her hair.
0:49:0|0:49:8|[Shan Shan] listened to [Liu Xuan]'s confession without saying a word, then picked up the backpack on the ground and walked into the house. [Liu Xuan] tried to follow her in, but was locked out by [Shan Shan].
0:49:11|0:49:16|[Liu Xuan] chuckled at the sound of [Shan Shan]'s voice, then turned around and walked away.
0:49:18|0:49:36|Shan Shan, leaning against the door, suddenly Brother Ba falls from the ceiling into the water. Shan Shan jumps into the water and after a moment, she stands up and looks at Brother Ba.
0:49:49|0:49:53|Brother Ba hit the ball coming towards him hard with a punch.
0:50:20|0:50:43|The mermaids here are collectively planning to kill [Liu Xuan], while on the other side, [Liu Xuan] is carrying a carefully prepared gift and heading for a date with [Shan Shan]. [Shan Shan] sits at the dining table with her hair down, watching as [Liu Xuan] approaches with roses. She smiles as she takes the roses from him, and [Liu Xuan] sits beside her, placing his hand on her shoulder. Just then, [Brother Ba] walks in confidently in a chef's outfit.
0:50:43|0:51:4|He hid his claws under the apron, looking very burly. Then he walked to the dining table, clenched his fists on both sides of his body, glared at them aggressively, roared, and revealed the claws holding the weapon.
0:51:32|0:51:56|Brother Ba threw his own claws onto the scorching iron plate, his expression instantly twisted in pain. Shan Shan looked at Brother Ba in horror, as two chefs began to cook Brother Ba's claws. Brother Ba's expression became more and more agonized as the chefs cut his claws off one by one.
0:52:5|0:52:13|The claws were put into the meat grinder,
0:52:26|0:52:55|[Liu Xuan] looked indifferent, while [Shan Shan] frowned. In the end, [Brother Ba] couldn't bear the pain anymore, he couldn't help but spray a large amount of ink forward, then got up and flew out of the window to escape. The bodyguards were all covered in black ink, [Liu Xuan] drove everyone out, then turned around and looked at [Shan Shan].
0:52:57|0:53:16|Shan Shan sat still for a moment, then turned her head with a smile to look at Liu Xuan. Shan Shan widened her eyes, put away her smile, and after a few seconds of daze, slowly took out a dagger from her bag. Liu Xuan grabbed Shan Shan's hand and took out a huge diamond ring from the box, putting it on Shan Shan's ring finger.
0:53:22|0:53:26|[Shan Shan] hesitated for a few seconds, then forcefully pulled her hand out of [Liu Xuan]'s hand.
0:54:40|0:55:0|Liu Xuan knocked the dagger out of Shan Shan's hand, then held her tightly to steady her. The two embraced tightly in the empty hall, kissing deeply. Shan Shan was intoxicated by Liu Xuan's kiss, tears slowly falling down her face. Just then, Li Ruolan suddenly walked in from the door.
0:55:0|0:55:28|Three people stood in silence in the room. [Shan Shan] glanced at [Liu Xuan] and immediately turned and left. My patience has its limits. [Liu Xuan] glanced at [Li Ruolan] and took out the bugged phone from his pocket.
0:55:44|0:55:57|[Liu Xuan] left [Li Ruolan] in the room without looking back, while on the other side, [Brother Ba] who had escaped was lying on the sofa, bandaging his battered feet.
0:56:29|0:56:48|[Brother Ba] squatted down and looked at the silent [Shan Shan]. Suddenly, [Brother Ba] started spinning in circles while doing a handstand, leaving [Shan Shan] completely bewildered.
0:57:4|0:57:16|[Shan Shan] angrily opened the door, only to find Liu Xuan outside. Liu Xuan looked at Shan Shan's fishtail, then at the mermaids filling the room and Brother Ba dancing on the fan.
0:57:21|0:57:38|[Liu Xuan] regained consciousness and looked at [Shan Shan]. [Shan Shan] also looked at him in horror. [Liu Xuan] turned around to run, but before he could take a step, he was knocked unconscious by Brother Ba. He woke up on the ground being splashed with cold water.
0:58:34|0:58:48|[Brother Ba] reached out his claws and wrapped them around [Liu Xuan]'s neck, pulling him to the ground and dragging him towards himself, using all his strength to try to strangle [Liu Xuan] with his claws.
0:58:48|0:59:9|Just then, [Shan Shan] suddenly appeared and used a dagger to cut off [Brother Ba]'s claws. [Liu Xuan] collapsed on the ground, gasping for breath, then jumped into the water to escape the danger.
0:59:9|0:59:18|Everyone looked at [Shan Shan] in astonishment. [Brother Ba] bent down to take the dagger from [Shan Shan]'s hand. [Shan Shan] was lying on the ground, bowing her head, tears streaming uncontrollably.
0:59:23|0:59:48|Shan Shan kept crying without saying a word, Brother Ba looked at her with disappointment, slowly raised the dagger in his hand. His hand holding the dagger was trembling, then he trembled and fell backwards. Meanwhile, Liu Xuan, who had just escaped, went straight to the police station, panting heavily as he sat in a chair.
1:0:17|1:0:41|The police drew a picture for [Liu Xuan] with the left half being a person and the right half being a fish, then drew another one with a tail on top and legs on the bottom, where the top was a person. The police turned the picture upside down and drew another one with a human face on top and a fish face on the bottom.
1:0:42|1:0:50|Another police officer gestured to [Liu Xuan], then took the paper and pen, adding thick hair to the sketch just now.
1:1:19|1:1:29|[Liu Xuan] excitedly recounted his experience, causing one of the police officers to burst into laughter.
1:1:42|1:1:49|Both police officers were trying hard to hold back their laughter as they covered their faces.
1:2:47|1:3:12|[Liu Xuan] suddenly pushed open the door, [Liu Xuan] helplessly left the office, laughter once again brought [Liu Xuan] back to the office, [Liu Xuan] looked at the two serious police officers with anger, turned around and left.
1:3:38|1:4:4|[Liu Xuan] looked at [Li Ruolan] at the door, walked over to her excitedly and hugged her. [Li Ruolan] reached out to hug [Liu Xuan] back, her smile growing bigger. [Liu Xuan] then stepped back from [Li Ruolan]'s embrace and held her arms up and down, examining her.
1:4:18|1:4:24|The scene shifts back to the dilapidated cabin, where [Shan Shan] looks at the mermaid gasping for breath in the glass tank.
1:4:32|1:4:45|[Shan Shan] leaned against the glass tank, silent, but her eyes were fixed on the dagger on the ground. She picked up the dagger, preparing to commit suicide, but her mother-in-law suddenly stopped her.
1:5:40|1:5:59|Grandma was talking, but her eyes were fixed on a painting on the wall depicting a mermaid and a human in love. The scene shifted to [Li Ruolan] lying on the bed in sexy lingerie, holding a cigarette in one hand, while [Liu Xuan] sat at the table, staring intently at the screen searching for information about mermaids.
1:6:5|1:6:19|Liu Xuan ignored Li Ruolan's calls and continued to stare at the screen, watching various materials and videos of ecological destruction online.
1:6:43|1:6:58|[Liu Xuan] walked step by step towards [Li Ruolan], then reached out and grabbed one of her feet. [Li Ruolan] leaned back, thinking that [Liu Xuan] was going to do something to her, but to her surprise, [Liu Xuan] just pulled out the clothes that were pressed under her.
1:7:11|1:7:35|[Li Ruolan] watched as [Liu Xuan] walked away, tears filling her eyes. She was trembling with anger. [Liu Xuan] hurried into the laboratory, passing by the staff, and entered the control room. Following the staff, [Liu Xuan] arrived at the sonar simulation room.
1:7:45|1:7:52|The sonar simulator slowly descended from above Liu Xuan's head as he stood alone in the empty room.
1:7:55|1:8:14|[Liu Xuan] hesitated for a moment as he looked at the sonar simulator. The staff turned on the switch of the simulator, and under the simulator's attack, [Liu Xuan]'s face contorted.
1:8:31|1:8:37|Liu Xuan pointed outside at the shareholders in front of him.
1:9:6|1:9:20|[Liu Xuan] was stunned by [Li Ruolan]'s words. He turned to look at [Li Ruolan], who smiled at him. The staff in the lab turned off the sonar. [Liu Xuan] raised his hand and patted [Li Ruolan]'s arm.
1:9:41|1:9:49|[Liu Xuan] pulled [Li Ruolan] aside with a raised hand,
1:10:7|1:10:15|[Li Ruolan] finished speaking and then turned around, pushing open the large door to her right and walked away.
1:10:23|1:10:28|Liu Xuan stood in the unfamiliar laboratory, completely stunned.
1:10:50|1:11:4|[Liu Xuan] was stunned by the scene before him. In the glass cabinet of the laboratory were the bodies of two mermaids, and he took a few steps forward, staring at everything in front of him, unable to speak for a long time.
1:11:19|1:11:26|[Li Ruolan] turned around to leave, but [Liu Xuan] grabbed her firmly.
1:12:19|1:12:31|[Li Ruolan] slapped [Liu Xuan], then turned and walked away. As she walked, she took off her red coat to reveal a tight leather bodysuit underneath. [Li Ruolan] quickly arrived at the mermaid's resting place with her fully armed subordinates.
1:12:53|1:12:58|[Li Ruolan]'s boat is getting closer to the mermaids, while [Liu Xuan] on the other side is waiting for his assistant to pick him up.
1:13:30|1:13:54|[Liu Xuan] drove away in a luxury car, while [Li Ruolan] and her subordinates arrived at the cargo ship where the mermaids lived. Many men in black used ropes to jump down from a hole in the ship, while others broke in through different entrances. The spacious cabin gradually filled with people holding weapons. The foreign man from the laboratory saw a painting in the cabin depicting a couple.
1:13:55|1:14:1|The wife is a mermaid, while the husband is a human. He then pointed underwater,
1:14:2|1:14:34|A man in a diving suit walked out from the crowd, turned on a powerful flashlight, and then dropped into the water from a plank. As soon as he jumped into the water, he used the flashlight to scan around the bottom of the boat. All the mermaids were seen below. The man slowly surfaced, then pointed underwater to the people on the shore and gave a thumbs-up. The people on the shore collectively aimed their guns at the water below.
1:14:36|1:14:56|On the shore, humans mercilessly fired at the underwater, injuring many mermaids. Everyone panicked and fled, the bright red blood gradually staining the bottom of the water. Meanwhile, [Liu Xuan] was stuck in traffic on the road in his luxury car.
1:15:1|1:15:27|The scene returns to the broken ship, where humans on the shore are still crazily shooting with guns. Many mermaids are forced to leave the water and jump onto the shore. One mermaid lies helplessly on the ground, holding a weapon that looks like a hammer. Several people around her take a step back, then raise their weapons together and stab fiercely towards her.
1:15:29|1:15:37|Blood stained the worn-out floor, all the mermaids were suffering from the ruthless hunting of humans, a young mermaid was captured.
1:15:37|1:15:57|The foreign man hurriedly scanned him with a scanning device, and the internal skeletal structure of the mermaid appeared clearly in front of the human. The foreign man waved his hand, and the person next to him immediately came over with a sack, then put the dying mermaid on the ground into it and threw it onto the nearby empty space.
1:15:58|1:16:11|Just then, as [Shan Shan] emerged from the water, she was immediately grabbed by the neck and pulled to the ground. A sickle was swung towards her head, but [Shan Shan] quickly dodged to the side and then desperately rushed into the water.
1:16:11|1:16:33|Two men with waterproof devices and crossbows jumped into the water closely following, [Shan Shan] swam desperately forward, with the humans behind in hot pursuit. [Shan Shan] agilely swung her body, dodging the crossbows shot from behind, then once again burst out of the water. She desperately avoided the weapons falling onto the spring bed, intending to escape with the help of the spring bed's force, but was still intercepted.
1:16:33|1:16:48|[Shan Shan] was forced to jump back into the U-shaped pool. Looking up, she saw many people rushing towards her with weapons. She used her fish tail to forcefully slap the ground, leveraging the force to fly in the air. The people coming to catch her all collided with each other and fell to the ground.
1:16:48|1:17:17|Shan Shan fell from the sky onto a human body, and the human seized her neck. At that moment, the octopus suddenly reached out its tentacles to rescue Shan Shan. After looking at Shan Shan and the humans in the cabin, it hurried to the launcher and shot Shan Shan out. The octopus itself fell into the water. People watched as Shan Shan in the air was once again targeted with weapons. Shan Shan luckily dodged all the weapons, but as she was about to escape from the cabin,
1:17:17|1:17:33|Being ambushed from above, [Shan Shan] was knocked back into the cabin, falling heavily to the ground and unable to get up. The humans around her watched as she lay helpless on the ground, weapons in hand, closing in on her step by step. Just as [Shan Shan] was on the brink of death, the human next to her was suddenly knocked down by a rush of water.
1:17:37|1:17:59|The water gradually calmed down, and the old lady appeared by [Shan Shan]'s side like a guardian angel. [Shan Shan] turned to look at the old lady by the pool, while the humans on the shore also looked on in surprise at this sudden appearance. The old lady slowly lifted her colorful tail from the water, then pressed down forcefully, causing the water in the pool to churn to the sides instantly.
1:17:59|1:18:23|All eyes were drawn to the churning waves in front of them. Some people standing on the shore were also swept out by the waves. Granny once again lifted her large tail and stirred up the water, repeatedly hitting the people nearby. All the humans on the shore were swept into the pool by the water flow, without any chance of resistance. Each of them danced in the air in a sorry state.
1:18:32|1:18:55|Grandma sat back in her original position, the pool in a mess with mermaid bodies everywhere. The remaining mermaids swam to the surface, those just put into sacks also struggled out. The foreign man who had been beaten and dropped by the water's edge still didn't give up. He watched as Grandma on the shore reached for the gun in front of her and pulled the trigger towards her.
1:18:55|1:19:4|Although the grandmother noticed the actions of the foreign man, she was still hit by a shell and thrown out of the cabin. The foreign man retracted his gun and struggled to crawl forward.
1:19:14|1:19:27|[Shan Shan] weakly lay in the cabin and let out a sigh, while the rest of the mermaids hurriedly escaped from the cabin and swam into the sea, and the humans on the boat launched another attack.
1:19:52|1:19:56|[Shan Shan] glanced back at the foreign man on the boat, ignoring the crossbow on her tail.
1:20:0|1:20:13|The foreign man on the boat tracked [Shan Shan]'s footsteps, then ran a few steps and jumped onto a nearby speedboat with a gun in hand. [Shan Shan] swam forward with all her strength, while the human speedboat behind her relentlessly pursued.
1:20:13|1:20:20|However, because of the buoy's presence, no matter where she runs, humans can find her based on the buoy's location.
1:20:20|1:20:45|Watching the speedboat getting closer and closer, she made a sudden turn, causing everyone on the speedboat to fall on the deck. The foreign man threw down his crossbow, aimed his gun at the sea, feeling frustrated. Suddenly, a helicopter flew overhead, it was Li Ruolan. Li Ruolan was searching for Shan Shan on the helicopter, while Shan Shan continued to swim forward.
1:20:45|1:20:57|Li Ruolan's helicopter followed Shan Shan's buoy to locate her, getting closer and closer. Li Ruolan looked at Shan Shan, who was within arm's reach, and without hesitation, raised the rocket launcher and fired it towards Shan Shan.
1:20:57|1:21:17|Li Ruolan was shaken by the power of the rocket, and the shell shot out straight towards Shan Shan. Shan Shan was directly hit by the shell and was blasted out of the water, with her body covered in wounds. She heavily fell on the land by the sea, struggling with all her strength to lift her head, only to see the museum curator she had once met.
1:21:17|1:21:40|He wore a wig, dressed in a cheap fishtail costume, and held a camera taking pictures of the children. The curator stared at [Shan Shan], raised the camera and took a picture of the blood-covered [Shan Shan] who was lying on the ground without saying a word. The people who were chasing him had already reached the shore. The curator saw someone running towards him with a gun and quickly ran away.
1:21:47|1:21:55|[Liu Xuan] threw a stack of money on the driver's face next to him.
1:22:24|1:22:46|[Liu Xuan] looked at the laughing Mr. Zheng, a smile appearing on his own face. The scene shifted, [Li Ruolan] in high heels, glaring fiercely at the disheveled [Shan Shan]. A foreign man with a gun turned to look at [Li Ruolan], her face showing no doubt. The foreign man had no choice but to aim the gun at [Shan Shan].
1:22:48|1:23:16|At that moment, [Liu Xuan] suddenly descended from the sky in Zheng's aircraft. [Li Ruolan] glared angrily at the approaching [Liu Xuan], who in turn stared back at her. Ignoring the hesitation of the gunmen next to Zhao Da, [Li Ruolan] snatched the gun from the foreign man's hand. While [Liu Xuan] threw himself on [Shan Shan], [Li Ruolan] disregarded everything and fired the gun again.
