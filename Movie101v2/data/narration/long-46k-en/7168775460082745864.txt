0:0:58|0:1:6|In the early morning, the sun rises over the city as a car is suddenly lifted in the parking lot. Inside a construction site, the sound of a man making a phone call can be heard.
0:1:12|0:1:30|The scene shifts, a woman opens a filing cabinet and skillfully turns on the computer. The man on the phone looks nervous, while in the conference room, two women are discussing in low voices in front of a desk piled with documents. With the sound of an engine revving, the scene moves into the conference room, where a cup of tea is placed heavily next to the woman.
0:1:37|0:1:51|[Jin Lanlan] politely thanked without lifting her head, her mind entirely focused on the documents in front of her. [Huang Longbiao] took a deep breath and stared straight at the diligently working [Jin Lanlan]. She slowly walked out of the meeting room, then turned back, looking nervous.
0:1:51|0:2:1|[Huang Longbiao] walked out helplessly, and as soon as she looked up, the sunlight made her sneeze. She looked around the construction site in front of her and then glanced back at [Jin Lanlan].
0:2:3|0:2:6|She shouted loudly in the empty space.
0:2:26|0:2:33|The scene cuts to [Jin Lanlan] and her group being taken to the construction site by [Huang Longbiao].
0:2:48|0:2:53|Huang Longbiao boasted for a while, but Jin Lanlan stared at the steel bars without saying a word, touching them with a look of doubt.
0:3:6|0:3:23|[Huang Longbiao] was caught in a lie and awkwardly lowered his head. In the hall, with a thunderous applause, [Jin Lanlan] walked up to the stage with a smile. A banner was hanging on the stage to warmly send off Comrade [Jin Lanlan] to the rural base. The applause continued as [Jin Lanlan] looked at the audience below and bowed deeply.
0:3:24|0:3:41|At night, the city is brightly lit with countless lights, a little girl sits quietly at a table playing with building blocks. [Jin Lanlan] is typing on the keyboard, creating a daily routine schedule for her daughter Qiaoqiao. Holding the printed schedule, she looks at it with a content smile and shouts loudly inside the house.
0:3:48|0:4:5|The husband put down the kitchen knife, looked at the menu, pushed his glasses up and said. As the husband was speaking, [Jin Lanlan] turned around and laughed. The husband walked towards [Jin Lanlan] with the menu in hand.
0:4:13|0:4:30|The scene shifts to a village covered in light mist, with the distant hillside faintly visible and houses neatly arranged. [Huang Longbiao], dressed in a suit and carrying a briefcase, leisurely walks along a country road whistling. As he turns a corner, he encounters a woman coming from the opposite direction, prompting him to immediately turn back.
0:4:37|0:4:50|[Huang Longbiao] ran while looking back, took out the car keys to open the door, and with a heavy slam of the door, he left. The woman watched [Huang Longbiao] running away, and said angrily.
0:4:50|0:5:0|A woman walks briskly on a deserted country road, occasionally using her hand to push back the bangs blown by the wind. She runs into the village committee, pushes open the door of the broadcasting room, and turns on the microphone.
0:5:24|0:5:34|The man put down his chopsticks and went out, only to run into [Luo Shanren] wearing a jacket with a worried look on his face. From a distance, [Luo Shanren] was so anxious that he even walked out of his shoes. The man mocked.
0:5:43|0:5:49|The mist-covered countryside, with the ground damp, [Luo Shanren] made a turn and arrived at the entrance of the village committee.
0:6:43|0:6:54|[Tao Hua] looked ferocious, stood up and said to [Luo Genxin]. [Tao Hua] left in anger, and [Luo Genxin] followed her out. [Luo Shanren] stood still, watching the two leaving.
0:6:57|0:7:3|The scene shifts, [Tao Hua] arrives at the village stream on a tractor, determined to leave the village and seek justice.
0:7:58|0:8:3|At this moment, Director [Fang] received a phone call and spoke to everyone.
0:8:18|0:8:25|Director Fang's face changed, he beckoned to a colleague beside him, pointed to the phone, then walked out of the meeting room and spoke into the phone.
0:9:3|0:9:9|The phone call was disconnected, [Luo Shanren] felt helpless and frustrated. [Tao Hua] arrived at the township government and spoke to the people behind him.
0:9:22|0:9:26|[Luo Genxin] stared at the sign of the township government and said to [Tao Hua].
0:9:41|0:9:50|Director Fang gave a few instructions, dismissed his subordinates, and with a worried look on his face, turned around to see Jin Lanlan and her group standing behind him.
0:10:9|0:10:17|In the small courtyard of the township government, [Jin Lanlan] and the village chief welcomed [Tao Hua] who came from the village. [Tao Hua] sat on a stone stool without saying a word, and the village chief broke the awkward silence.
0:12:13|0:12:20|Jin Lanlan sits on a tractor and returns to Luotang Village with Tao Hua.
0:13:13|0:13:22|A new life is about to begin, [Jin Lanlan] looks at a photo of her and her daughter, full of energy. Meanwhile, [Luo Shanren] arrives at a small house on the second floor.
0:14:18|0:14:36|As the sun gradually sets, the time slowly reaches 7 o'clock in the evening. The village committee is unusually quiet, with only the sound of the clock ticking away. [Jin Lanlan] glanced at the clock, then looked at the empty meeting room with a serious expression. Outside the door, [Luo Shanren] checked his watch anxiously, waiting impatiently.
0:14:36|0:14:46|After a while, she adjusted her jacket and cleared her throat before heading towards the meeting room. As soon as she walked in, [Luo Shanren] saw [Jin Lanlan] standing with her back to her and immediately changed his expression.
0:14:50|0:14:53|[Luo Shanren] was somewhat surprised by [Jin Lanlan]'s attitude.
0:15:17|0:15:24|Watching [Jin Lanlan] leave, the person upstairs muttered to themselves. After a moment of contemplation, she stuffed her hands in her pockets and hurried to catch up.
0:15:53|0:16:0|[Luo Shanren] brought [Jin Lanlan] to the door, he knocked on the latch, and the person inside responded.
0:16:17|0:16:20|In the house, [Tao Hua] slapped his thigh, looking fierce.
0:16:28|0:16:37|In the courtyard, [Tao Hua] leaned against the wall and called Shan Shan back, gently pulling her away from the door. Outside the door, [Jin Lanlan] listened quietly, looking puzzled.
0:17:11|0:17:29|[Luo Shanren] took a deep breath and took the opportunity to leave quickly. Watching [Luo Shanren] leave, [Jin Lanlan] looked through the crack of the door at [Tao Hua]'s house, shaking her head with a bitter smile. As the night grew darker, [Jin Lanlan] walked alone in Luotang Village, looking at the unfamiliar houses around her. She stopped in her tracks, her eyes moistened.
0:17:29|0:17:35|After a moment of contemplation, [Jin Lanlan] continued to walk forward. It was late at night, and the only sound on the country road was the continuous chirping of insects.
0:17:36|0:17:53|[Jin Lanlan] dragged her weary body, head down and pace slow, guided by a bright street lamp back to the house. In the moment she crossed the threshold, a sense of powerlessness struck her, and she could only use her hand to support the door frame as she slowly entered. Dragging her heavy body, [Jin Lanlan] closed the door behind her.
0:17:53|0:18:0|At this moment, a sudden ringing of the phone broke out, and [Jin Lanlan] leaned against the wall to take out her phone to check.
0:18:14|0:18:18|[Jin Lanlan] took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and said.
0:18:46|0:18:49|Alright, since you're not willing to back down.
0:19:9|0:19:28|In the early morning, a thin mist hung in the air, the sound of attacks echoing throughout the village. Most villagers were still asleep, and the village roads were deserted. [Jin Lanlan] was wearing comfortable sportswear as she jogged in the village of Luotang. She passed through houses and alleys, crossed winding streams and stone bridges covered with plants.
0:19:28|0:19:33|[Jin Lanlan] adjusted her emotions, walked lightly, and arrived at the old secretary's second-floor attic.
0:19:40|0:19:44|[Jin Lanlan] praised the flowers, smelling and looking at them, while the old secretary was busy watering the plants.
0:20:22|0:20:32|The old secretary stared at Jin Lanlan in front of him, then turned and walked downstairs. Jin Lanlan playfully looked at the angry old secretary leaving, smiling as she placed her hand on the railing and shouted down to the old secretary below.
0:20:36|0:20:58|Yu Bi's face changed from anger to surprise. She turned her head to look at [Jin Lanlan] upstairs. The [Jin Lanlan] on the attic still had a smile on her face, then turned and walked downstairs. The old secretary walked towards the small wooden table with her hands behind her back, deep in thought. [Jin Lanlan] coming down from the second floor called out to her and placed a hand on the old secretary's shoulder.
0:20:58|0:21:5|He patted her on the back, gesturing for her to sit down. They sat side by side, and the old secretary turned his head to the side. [Jin Lanlan] took the opportunity to speak.
0:21:46|0:22:1|The old secretary looked at the furrowed brow of [Jin Lanlan], pondered for a moment, and said to her. The old secretary sighed helplessly, lost in thought.
0:23:39|0:23:45|The scene cuts to Luo Shanren finishing a large jug of water, making a sound of enjoyment. He sets down the cup.
0:26:33|0:26:36|It's when the strawberry needs water.
0:28:17|0:28:23|Yu Bi, [Jin Lanlan] with a determined look in her eyes, is determined to resolve this matter. In the park, [Huang Longbiao]'s phone rings.
0:29:13|0:29:20|The scene shifts, and the banknote printing machine hums loudly. Inside the teahouse, [Huang Longbiao] hands the cowhide paper containing the banknotes to [Jin Lanlan].
0:29:40|0:29:46|[Jin Lanlan] picked up the paper bag and opened it, only to see [Huang Longbiao] gesturing with his hands. [Jin Lanlan] looked at him and spoke.
0:29:58|0:30:7|[Huang Longbiao] looked at [Jin Lanlan] in astonishment, his body stiffening as he leaned back. [Jin Lanlan] smiled at him. [Huang Longbiao] let out a cold laugh.
0:30:29|0:30:32|[Huang Longbiao] looked aggrieved, sighed, and continued speaking.
0:30:52|0:31:13|In the early morning, birds chirped outside as the sun shone brightly. Early riser [Jin Lanlan] pulled up the curtains and tidied up the bed. The interior was simple and plain, with just a table and a shelf as the only furniture. [Jin Lanlan] soaked a towel, carefully wiped her cheeks, and then quickly fixed her hair in front of the mirror.
0:31:14|0:31:25|Sent to deal with the excess water, she busied herself with eating. She casually picked up a packet of instant noodles from the table, sat on the edge of the bed, and opened it. Suddenly, as if she remembered something, her hands stopped moving.
0:31:25|0:31:37|After a moment of contemplation, [Jin Lanlan] placed the instant noodles back on the table and got up to leave. Her figure grew increasingly distant, gradually becoming blurred. The instant noodles on the table and the photo of her daughter beside it remained untouched, with no one else coming near them.
0:31:37|0:31:52|In the quiet village, [Jin Lanlan] walked briskly, looking around as she walked. Just around the corner, she saw a house with a slightly ajar door. She smiled and gently pushed open the door, walking closer. The courtyard was quiet and empty, with various plants growing.
0:31:53|0:32:8|Walking further in, [Jin Lanlan] saw the serious Shan Shan sitting in the small courtyard, writing something. Her steps were light, slowly approaching, unwilling to disturb the focused Shan Shan in front of her. Then she bent down, leaned close to Shan Shan's ear, and the concentrated Shan Shan was startled.
0:35:47|0:35:53|Luo Genxin watched Luo Shanren walking away, feeling a mix of emotions and tightening his lips, a thought forming in his mind.
0:35:53|0:36:10|At night, a bag was hung on the door of [Jin Lanlan]'s room, containing a square gift box. It looked very valuable. He opened the door, took the bag and looked at it for a long time without any clue. Then he walked out, looking around. In the distance, a man was standing with his hands behind his back in the darkness.
0:36:10|0:36:21|Strolling on the deserted road, looking at the man's back, he seemed to understand something, smiled slightly, then turned around and saw the bag on the door. After a moment of contemplation, he took down the bag and walked into the house.
0:36:21|0:36:39|The night was deep, and the village of Luo Tang was very quiet, with only the sound of frogs still chirping. [Luo Genxin] walked home with his hands in his pockets, looking relaxed. Inside the house, his daughter was diligently doing her homework. Hearing some movement outside the door, she stopped writing and looked up. Seeing [Luo Genxin] returning, she complained to him.
0:36:42|0:36:50|The daughter saw [Luo Genxin] not responding for a long time, then turned her head and put down the pen in her hand, walking towards him.
0:37:10|0:37:14|The daughter nodded heavily at [Luo Genxin] and then there was a knock on the door from outside.
0:37:33|0:37:51|[Luo Genxin] walked out with his hands behind his back, and as soon as he stepped out of the door, he saw a bag on the ground with square gift boxes inside, all intact. He looked around with the bag in his hand, only to see [Jin Lanlan]'s figure getting further and further away in the distance. He couldn't believe it, and turned around blankly to walk back into the house.
0:37:51|0:37:57|In front of the table, [Luo Genxin] held the bag for a long time, then put it down heavily, supporting the table with both hands while deep in thought.
0:37:59|0:38:3|The doctor's train of thought was abruptly interrupted by a text message alert.
0:38:37|0:38:54|With a resounding clang that echoed through the sky, Luo Shanren's day began once again. The thin morning mist shrouded the countryside, and Jin Lanlan, as usual, got up early for a morning run. She passed through the alleys of the houses and eventually disappeared at the end of the road. The scene shifted, and Huang Longbiao arrived at the village committee of Luo Tang Village.
0:38:54|0:39:3|He stood outside the conference room door knocking for a long time, but no one opened it. He pressed his ear against the door, confirmed there was no sound, and then began to look around and wander aimlessly.
0:39:10|0:39:20|He walked while observing if there were any familiar faces around, acting very cautiously. [Huang Longbiao] opened the car door, started the car in one go, without any intention of staying longer.
0:39:21|0:39:36|At this moment, [Luo Genxin] happened to come out from the corner and saw [Huang Longbiao], so he hurriedly chased after him. However, the timing was not right, so he could only helplessly sniff the dust. Without hesitation, [Luo Genxin] immediately turned around and ran back to the village. At the next intersection, he arrived at the door of [Tao Hua]'s house.
0:40:40|0:40:46|[Tao Hua] took off her apron and turned to leave. [Luo Genxin] was so scared by [Tao Hua] that he stood still, watching her leaving and muttering softly.
0:41:0|0:41:15|After some self-suggestion, [Luo Genxin] happily turned around and left. [Huang Longbiao] parked the car in the strawberry field, just as the old secretary passed by. He shielded the light with his hand, trying to see if there was anyone in the car. When he turned his head again, he saw [Huang Longbiao] squatting alone in the strawberry field.
0:41:15|0:41:32|The old secretary hurriedly went down to the field, but unexpectedly he fell into the ground. He dusted off his clothes and the dirt in his hands, and with a single-minded focus, he walked towards [Huang Longbiao]. [Huang Longbiao], who was squatting on the ground, was busy playing with the strawberry seedlings in front of him, completely unaware of the old secretary's arrival. The old secretary slowly approached him, bent over, and spoke to him.
0:41:34|0:41:40|Oh, the old secretary has a serious expression, staring straight at [Huang Longbiao].
0:43:41|0:43:59|The scene shifts to inside Luo Tang Village, where [Luo Genxin] has gathered a group of people and is striding aggressively along the path towards the fields. [Tao Hua] is at home drying grains when [Luo Shanren] rushes over, nearly tripping over. He gasps for breath and says.
0:44:25|0:44:43|On the other side, [Jin Lanlan], upon hearing the news, became even more anxious. While the sun was shining brightly in Luotang Village with clear skies for miles, [Jin Lanlan] was feeling extremely worried. She ran non-stop, not daring to take a moment's rest. The quiet village only heard the sound of her footsteps, and the sound of flowers absorbing water seemed to be urging her on.
0:44:43|0:44:46|[Tao Hua] leisurely drinks tea at home, while [Luo Shanren] is in a dilemma.
0:45:24|0:45:42|The scene shifts, with Luo Genxin directing two tractors to slowly break the iron net in the strawberry field, while the levelling machine in the middle is used to remove the strawberry seedlings. At this moment, Jin Lanlan runs over from a distance, shouting and waving her hands to signal them to stop. She blocks the tractors with her body and shouts at Luo Genxin on the vehicle.
0:46:26|0:46:37|Taohua and [Jin Lanlan] looked at the aggrieved [Luo Genxin] in front of them, feeling both angry and helpless. [Luo Genxin] realized his mistake, turned his head to the side, and squatted on the ground in shame. In another room, [Huang Longbiao] slammed the contract on the table.
0:48:22|0:48:26|In a warm and harmonious atmosphere, we reached a consensus while being friendly and amicable.
0:49:31|0:49:40|[Luo Shanren] was so angry that he could only pace back and forth in front of the village committee, hands on hips and shaking his head repeatedly, but he could only console himself.
0:50:24|0:50:28|On the construction site, [Huang Longbiao] walks while talking on the phone.
0:51:4|0:51:8|[Luo Shanren] answered the phone casually, picked up the teapot and took a sip, then continued speaking.
0:53:27|0:53:41|The scene shifts, the sky is very gloomy, thunder rumbles, and pouring rain falls from the sky, shaking the surrounding trees. [Jin Lanlan] hurriedly runs out of the taxi, but still ends up drenched.
0:54:48|0:55:6|The rain chased by the hornet, like countless whips, lashing the houses of [Luo Tangcun]. Inside the house, [Jin Lanlan] at the desk was dealing with official business under the light of the only desk lamp. For some unknown reason, the light suddenly went out. [Jin Lanlan] quickly got up to open the door to check, and at that moment, the phone rang.
0:55:6|0:55:9|[Jin Lanlan] looked outside, where the torrential rain continued unabated.
0:55:11|0:55:28|After hanging up the phone, [Jin Lanlan] put on a plastic raincoat, grabbed a flashlight, tightened her collar, and ran into the rain. The heavy rain became more and more intense, with thunder constantly coming from the sky, and the strong wind hindered [Jin Lanlan]'s progress. She could only rely on the faint light of the flashlight to walk laboriously in the rain.
0:55:28|0:55:31|Turning around again, she saw Aunt [Luo Genxin] sitting in a wheelchair, gazing into the rain.
0:55:56|0:56:0|Outside the house, the heavy rain continued, and all the pots at [Luo Shanren]'s house were used to collect rainwater.
0:56:1|0:56:16|[Jin Lanlan] shone her flashlight towards the roof, only to find a large hole above. Without hesitation, she picked up the ladder outside and climbed up to the roof. Thunder roared, and the heavy rain washed over [Jin Lanlan]'s face as she struggled to climb with an umbrella in hand. [Director Fang] was worried about her and shouted loudly.
0:56:20|0:56:33|[Jin Lanlan] had just climbed onto the roof when the ladder beneath her fell. She quickly looked back, but without much thought, continued to climb towards the hole in the roof. Lowering her head to adjust her position, [Jin Lanlan] pushed aside the broken tiles and turned back to comfort the more spirited.
0:56:39|0:56:56|Jin Lanlan took a deep breath, accelerated her movements, and lifted the damaged tiles one by one. Then, she neatly laid out the rain canopy, completely covering the hole, and secured the four corners with nearby tiles. Despite wearing clothes, she continued to be drenched by the relentless rain.
0:56:57|0:57:15|The rain washed the tiles making them extremely slippery. [Jin Lanlan] was focused on her hands, almost slipping and falling due to the slippery surface. Below, [Luo Shanren] sat in a wheelchair, holding a flashlight and closely watching [Jin Lanlan] with a tense and worried expression. Gasping for air, [Jin Lanlan] lay on the roof, rain mercilessly beating down on her.
0:57:15|0:57:29|Constantly testing her endurance, [Jin Lanlan] pushed aside the wet hair covering her cheeks. After taking a short break, she continued with the task at hand, repositioning the canopy. This time, her speed noticeably slowed down, taking a break after securing the canopy each time.
0:57:29|0:57:46|He held down the umbrella being lifted by the strong wind with one hand, and pushed aside the broken flower petals with the other hand, repeating this action countless times. He secured the umbrella again, and was startled by a sudden thunder, almost slipping and falling. Finally, he successfully secured the umbrella.
0:57:46|0:57:54|Looking at the eaves behind him, [Luo Shanren] subconsciously climbed up a few centimeters, then collapsed limp on the chair, letting the rain beat down on him.
0:57:57|0:58:17|In the early morning, as the dark clouds dispersed in the sky, birds chirped loudly. [Jin Lanlan]'s bed was neatly made, with the clock on the bedside showing 6:05. Next to the clock was a photo of [Jin Lanlan] with her daughter. Inside the room, clothes on the hanger were still dripping with rainwater, but [Jin Lanlan] was not in the room. The scene then shifted.
0:58:17|0:58:21|[Jin Lanlan] is running along the stream, and [Luo Shanren] sees her and quickly calls out to her.
0:59:16|0:59:19|It was him who brought your strawberry seedlings back to life.
1:1:50|1:1:55|Plant the strawberries you grow using modern planting techniques to increase production.
1:3:24|1:3:26|The average income per capita is 496.79 yuan.
1:3:44|1:3:49|Before the words were finished, the door was kicked open, and [Luo Genxin] walked into the meeting room with a serious expression, hands behind his back.
1:4:22|1:4:38|[Luo Genxin] brought [Jin Lanlan] to a old tree in Lotang Village, with her back facing [Jin Lanlan], he swiftly took off his jacket and made a series of martial arts moves in the air. [Jin Lanlan] playfully watched [Luo Genxin], who slowly turned around.
1:5:23|1:5:30|The atmosphere gradually eased, [Luo Genxin] picked up the coat on the ground and sat on the steps, with [Jin Lanlan] following suit.
1:7:33|1:7:45|[Jin Lanlan] smiled as she watched the old secretary leave, feeling relieved that she had finally gained his approval. In the distance, there came a loud shout from Jiaojiao in the village of Luotang.
1:8:9|1:8:17|Jiao Jiao waved the acceptance letter and ran towards [Luo Genxin]. [Luo Genxin] sat at the door, staring at the letter, looking incredulous.
1:10:15|1:10:40|To eat a Di Bao, you have to look at someone's smiling face and get hit by someone. What are you saying? Slow down, slow down, slow down. Luo Tang Village's ancestors have been in the position of a thousand miles immortal. [Luo Genxin] puts the plump fish into the oil pan, ready to show off his skills. Jiaojiao walks into the kitchen and says, "Dad, Dad, Dad, have you watched the prelude?"
1:11:23|1:11:27|Upon hearing the high tuition fees, Luo Genxin fell into contemplation, while Jiaojiao waved her hand.
1:11:33|1:11:52|[Luo Genxin] said it was nothing, but his expression became somewhat embarrassed. The high tuition fees made him headache, and he had no interest in the sizzling fish in the pot. As night fell, the lively Luo Tang Village became quiet. [Luo Genxin] sat alone by the window, one hand on the windowsill, the other propping up his chin, staring blankly at the roof.
1:11:52|1:12:11|He got up again and looked at the moonlight outside the window, his face full of heavy thoughts. Before long, he sat by the flowerpot, playing with the leaves inside, looking very melancholic. Finally, he returned to the desk, took his beloved brush and contemplated for a long time. He wrote down the four characters of "urgent housing" with a blank expression, then stared ahead blankly.
1:12:11|1:12:18|With a look of helplessness and reluctance in her eyes, [Jin Lanlan] quietly approached the back of [Luo Genxin], wanting to give him a surprise.
1:13:55|1:14:13|[Luo Genxin] pushed [Jin Lanlan] out of the room, quickly closed the door, and leaned against the door lock. At this moment, a myriad of emotions surged in his heart, her eyes gradually moistened, and she sat weakly on the edge of the bed, looking at everything in the room. Although the house was not big, it was full of joy and warmth, and the memories of the past were still vivid.
1:14:13|1:14:24|[Luo Genxin] thought this way in her heart, tears streaming down unexpectedly. She quickly wiped them away with her hand, controlling her emotions. The next day arrived, with the warm sunlight enveloping the village of Luotang. [Huang Longbiao] went for his morning run as usual.
1:14:25|1:14:40|Passing by the door of Luo Genxin's house, Jin Lanlan saw a notice posted there. She stopped and went forward to check it out. The notice stated that the house was for urgent sale, the owner wanted to sell the old house quickly, it was a feng shui treasure land, with a discounted price. Interested parties could negotiate in person, insincere parties were not welcome. Luo Genxin.
1:14:40|1:14:48|Jin Lanlan walked up to the notice privately, her eyes flickered, a thought suddenly appeared, she folded the notice simply, smiled and continued to run towards the village.
1:14:50|1:15:0|The camera slowly moves up, the sun is shining brightly outside, and the birds are chirping happily. However, inside the house is very dark, with [Luo Genxin] sitting by the window, lost in thought after a sleepless night.
1:15:5|1:15:8|[Jin Lanlan]'s husband rushed over in an apron and was very happy to see the incoming call.
1:15:16|1:15:19|Upon hearing this, [Jin Lanlan] suddenly remembered something, instantly regretting it. She felt a bit embarrassed and started speaking incoherently.
1:16:5|1:16:8|Jin Lanlan's tears fell instantly, and she quickly covered the phone's microphone.
1:16:39|1:16:50|The scene shifts, [Jin Lanlan] walks with a light step, holding a sign for a house on urgent sale, and arrives at the building where [Luo Genxin] lives. She looks up and sees [Luo Genxin] sitting by the window in a daze, and shouts to him.
1:17:0|1:17:7|[Luo Genxin] turned his head to the side while speaking. Seeing this, [Jin Lanlan] took out a flyer for a house on urgent sale and showed it to him. [Luo Genxin] was impatient.
1:17:23|1:17:34|[Luo Genxin] instantly perked up, and after speaking, he slowly walked down the stairs with his hands behind his back. [Jin Lanlan] lowered her head and smiled, teasingly watching him. She saw [Luo Genxin] point to the chair and say to [Jin Lanlan].
