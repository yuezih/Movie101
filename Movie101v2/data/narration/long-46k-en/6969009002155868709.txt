0:1:2|0:1:8|The sky was gray, and several robust Hex Maniacs flew into the valley, where thousands of monsters had gathered on the ground.
0:1:10|0:1:18|The scene fades out, entering a quiet forest.
0:1:27|0:1:33|The [Old Demon Queen] looked around in the bushes.
0:1:40|0:1:58|The short and fat [Pawnshop Mistress] and two followers heard a low growl, immediately stopped in their tracks. One follower said, "[Pawnshop Mistress], flee in panic!" The two followers exchanged a glance and charged towards the two giant blood demons behind them. One follower was thrown onto a tree trunk by the blood demon and instantly fainted, while the other was knocked unconscious on the spot.
0:1:58|0:2:14|[Grandma] hid behind a tree and peeked, the blood demon kicked towards the follower, who howled in pain. [The demon queen] fled in a panic and stopped, facing a tree almost as tall as her. She didn't know where to go, and the blood demon descended from the sky, staring at [the demon queen], spreading its wings with a furious roar.
0:2:14|0:2:25|The [Demon Queen] fearfully used two tentacles to block in front of her, while the little demon dragonflies watched from afar. The [Demon Queen] was scared by the roar of the blood demon and turned to run, but was caught by the blood demon after only a few steps.
0:2:26|0:2:32|The four ears of the Blood Demon shook, shooting the [Demon Queen] towards the ground, scaring the onlookers into the ground in an instant.
0:2:32|0:2:47|The demon queen was caught by the blood monster and couldn't move. She begged him and then said, "Zhu Gao suddenly appeared and pounced on the blood demon's head, tearing at its upper eyelid. The blood demon was furious, gnashing its teeth, and reaching out with its huge palm but couldn't hit him."
0:2:52|0:3:2|Pang Ying, who is round and plump, hits the Blood Demon on the head, causing it to crash solidly onto the ground. The Blood Demon shakes its head to regain consciousness, and Zhu Gao warns the Queen to be careful. Zhu Gao and Pang Ying quickly flee with the Demon Queen.
0:3:2|0:3:14|The blood demon crashed into a tree and chased after it. The demon queen collapsed to the ground holding her stomach, gasping for breath. The blood demon let out a triumphant roar but froze in place. [Pang Ying] licked her lips, tossed her hair, and blew a string of kisses.
0:3:15|0:3:21|The blood demon suddenly spurted nosebleed, [Zhu Gao] saw [Pang Ying] and the blood demon flirting, immediately launched a heavy punch at the blood demon.
0:3:23|0:3:28|He said that [Zhu Gao] was bouncing to attack the Blood Demon, but was caught by the Blood Demon.
0:3:29|0:3:45|[Zhu Gao] used his four arms to forcefully hold open the blood demon's huge palm. Not far behind the blood demon were four closely spaced trees. [Pang Ying] spun rapidly and rammed into the blood demon's belly. The blood demon grunted and fell backwards, getting stuck perfectly between the four trees.
0:3:47|0:3:56|[Zhu Gao] hurriedly protected the demon queen and fled, while the blood demon was trapped in a tree unable to escape. A little demon [Zhu Dragonfly] furrowed its brow and flew towards the distance above the forest.
0:4:0|0:4:19|The green tentacles on the ground form the stone characters of the movie title, "Monster Hunt". [Huo Xiaolan] slowly gets up from the ground, with four trees collapsed beside her, their roots exposed. The scene transitions to Yongyun Village.
0:4:56|0:4:58|Xiao Wu was also thrown out by Aunt Li.
0:5:7|0:5:15|As they were talking, a pile of clothes was thrown onto the two of them, and inside the house, [Song Tianyin] and [Xiao Wu] happily folded the clothes.
0:5:20|0:5:27|[Song Tianyin] adjusted the brace on his right leg and limped into the inner room.
0:5:50|0:5:56|He blocked the sticks with a carrying pole.
0:6:57|0:7:15|After [Grandma] left, [Song Tianyin] immediately turned around and slammed the door in frustration. In the center of the ancient city, a towering square pagoda-style building stood out conspicuously, with a magnificent and intricate structure, appearing mysterious and solemn. [Ge Qianhu] touched his eyebrows in front of a bronze mirror and smiled with satisfaction.
0:7:15|0:7:22|The little demon dragonfly by Huo Xiaolan's side immediately flew away.
0:7:31|0:7:36|A small copper chair followed [Ge Qianhu] obediently, stopping promptly when signaled.
0:7:55|0:8:10|The maid served the chefs standing with wine glasses. The chefs nodded in thanks, but [Ge Qianhu] felt a bit uncomfortable sitting on the chair. He pursed his lips, turned his head, and glared. The chair immediately rose significantly upon receiving the command.
0:8:34|0:8:43|The chefs were drinking, [Ge Qianhu] sipped his wine and looked around at everyone. By the green river, [Song Tianyin] was boredly throwing stones into the water.
0:8:50|0:9:4|Transformed into human form, [Pang Ying] saw [Song Tianyin], dressed in pink sand, [Pang Ying] held a daisy and walked towards [Song Tianyin], getting close to his chest, intoxicated as she took a sniff.
0:9:6|0:9:12|[Pang Ying] glanced at [Song Tianyin] and walked around him in a circle.
0:10:5|0:10:26|Not far away, the bamboo dragonfly wanted to catch up with them. The three of them entered the hut of [Song Tianyin]. [Song Tianyin] tied [Zhu Gao]'s donkey to the door pillar outside the hut. [Zhu Gao], behind [Pang Ying], struggled to carry the basket. [Zhu Gao] quickly moved aside with the basket, refusing [Song Tianyin]'s help.
0:10:29|0:10:40|[Huo Xiaolan] walked in with a fierce look, staring straight at [Pang Ying] and the others. [Zhu Gao]'s face twitched quickly as [Huo Xiaolan] fixed her gaze on them, then she boldly sat down after throwing her coat aside.
0:10:41|0:11:6|He had two copper coins strung together with red thread hanging on his chest, and [Pang Ying] snorted disdainfully. At that moment, [Song Tianyin] walked in with a teapot, nodded and smiled at [Huo Xiaolan]. [Pang Ying] and [Zhu Gao] were both stunned, while [Huo Xiaolan] looked at them calmly. [Pang Ying] and [Zhu Gao] exchanged glances.
0:11:6|0:11:10|At this moment, [Song Tianyin] suddenly clapped his hands.
0:11:12|0:11:16|[Huo Xiaolan] looked at [Song Tianyin] as if he were a fool, [Song Tianyin] forced a smile, while [Zhu Gao] chuckled without saying a word.
0:11:24|0:11:32|[Zhu Gao] threw the slingshot in his hand, and it flew around the house, closing all the windows and doors.
0:11:45|0:11:51|Huo Xiaolan flew straight towards [Huo Xiaolan]. [Huo Xiaolan] dodged, and then Pang Ying and [Huo Xiaolan] immediately started a fierce fight.
0:11:59|0:12:17|[Pang Ying] crossed the roof and stood with her hands in a claw-like position, her bones creaking. [Huo Xiaolan] cracked her whip to firmly bind [Pang Ying], who was then slammed heavily to the ground. Upon seeing this, [Zhu Gao] quickly grabbed the chopsticks from the chopstick holder and threw them at [Huo Xiaolan], who easily blocked them.
0:12:20|0:12:29|[Huo Xiaolan] flew around a pillar, threw out a whip tied to [Zhu Gao], and [Zhu Gao] could only swing along with it.
0:12:31|0:12:37|[Zhu Gao] was stabbed and fell to the ground in pain, while [Song Tianyin] fled in panic.
0:12:46|0:12:54|[Zhu Gao] bumped [Huo Xiaolan] back several steps. He smirked slyly, took off his human skin, revealing a tall and skinny green leafy form.
0:13:2|0:13:10|[Pang Ying] also shed her human skin, instantly reverting to the short and chubby Pang Ying, with red leaves in her hair, looking adorable and naive.
0:13:27|0:13:35|[Zhu Gao] suddenly kissed [Pang Ying], seeing this scene, [Huo Xiaolan] turned her head and used a whip to separate the two demons.
0:13:43|0:13:58|[Huo Xiaolan] was knocked back, [Zhu Gao] rapidly struck [Huo Xiaolan], [Huo Xiaolan] then lunged forward and kicked [Zhu Gao] down.
0:14:5|0:14:20|Then carefully sniffing the scent on [Song Tianyin], seeming curious about him, [Song Tianyin] dared not move at all, while [Zhu Gao] firmly pressed down on [Huo Xiaolan].
0:14:25|0:14:37|He was pinned down, [Pang Ying] lunged at [Huo Xiaolan] but she dodged it, and [Pang Ying] took away the talisman.
0:14:49|0:15:3|[Song Tianyin] raised his hands above his head and slowly walked out, with the demon queen holding a stick behind him. [Luo Gang] suddenly attacked the demon queen, and [Huo Xiaolan] immediately blocked him. After spraying water on [Song Tianyin]'s face, the demon queen broke through the door and escaped.
0:15:12|0:15:18|[Song Tianyin] cautiously lifted the stool closer to [Huo Xiaolan].
0:15:44|0:16:4|[Huo Xiaolan] turned to look at him with a sly smile, reaching towards her neck with her left hand as if to peel off someone's skin. She forcefully kicked her legs, signaling to [Song Tianyin] to put down the stool, and [Song Tianyin] obediently complied.
0:16:19|0:16:27|[Song Tianyin] was frightened and staggered away silently, while [Huo Xiaolan] brandished a knife and threatened. [Song Tianyin], with a fearful expression, nodded vigorously and limped away.
0:16:34|0:16:41|[Huo Xiaolan] looked at herself in the mirror with satisfaction, while smoke still rose from the village at night. Inside the house, [Huo Xiaolan] slurped the noodles in her bowl.
0:16:58|0:17:8|[Huo Xiaolan] looked up at [Song Tianyin], who quickly wiped the smile off his face. [Huo Xiaolan] continued to eat her noodles with her head down, while [Song Tianyin] sat down disheartened, watching her.
0:17:22|0:17:29|Song Tianyin was startled and picked up his chopsticks to pick up some food. Huo Xiaolan slammed the table and warned him with her eyes not to touch it.
0:17:31|0:17:43|Song Tianyin got up with a sense of grievance. Huo Xiaolan raised her eyes, supported her chin with her hand, and looked at him with a smile.
0:17:52|0:18:12|The night enveloped the village, inside the house, [Song Tianyin] tried to touch [Huo Xiaolan] but was slapped away. [Huo Xiaolan] pushed [Song Tianyin] down, who shyly tried to undress but had his hands tied by [Huo Xiaolan], who smirked and wrapped a rope around [Song Tianyin]'s wrist.
0:18:14|0:18:29|[Song Tianyin] watched [Huo Xiaolan] eagerly twisting and blushing shyly to the side, but his feet were tightly bound. The upper room of the bed had already set up a net with bells tied to it, [Huo Xiaolan] leaned over by the door, and the two of them chuckled foolishly.
0:18:33|0:18:43|[Huo Xiaolan] suddenly turned fierce, then quickly put on a smile and pouted as if she was going to kiss him. She quickly wiped [Song Tianyin]'s mouth, which she had firmly sealed.
0:18:53|0:19:13|[Huo Xiaolan] explained and then turned over to sleep, ignoring him. [Song Tianyin] looked down at his toes, his whole body already tied up. Under the ancient tree, a person rested against a rock, with a pile of bonfire in front of him. [Luo Gang] untied the cloth bundle, picked up a piece of dry food from inside and stared at it.
0:19:15|0:19:37|After some thought, he broke the dry rations into two pieces. Beside him, [Pang Ying] and [Zhu Gao] were drooling with desire. [Luo Gang] glanced at the dry rations, put half of them in his pocket, and started enjoying the other half. As he chewed, he watched the two little demons. The two little demons, feeling dejected, suddenly burst into song.
0:22:9|0:22:22|In [Song Tianyin]'s small house, two people were sleeping soundly. A small knife was quietly sawing the wooden board under [Song Tianyin] while he was asleep, which seemed to disturb [Huo Xiaolan]. She frowned, turned over, crossed her arms, and went back to sleep.
0:22:23|0:22:38|The knife paused for a moment before resuming work. [Song Tianyin] leaned over and accidentally bumped into the knife, instantly waking up. He looked sideways to observe behind him, but the knife suddenly accelerated wildly. He tried to wake up [Huo Xiaolan], but the bed beneath him began to sink.
0:22:39|0:22:48|[Huo Xiaolan] rubbed her face with her arm, but she didn't wake up. [Song Tianyin] sank to the bottom, staring with wide eyes but unable to make a sound, only to be dragged into the darkness.
0:22:50|0:23:12|The light gradually came in, [Song Tianyin] was dragged forward. The demon queen dragged him out of the cave, [Song Tianyin] opened his eyes to observe the surroundings. He looked around blankly with his mouth closed, and the demon queen pushed him to the side of a tree trunk, extending her claws to remove the spell on his mouth. [Song Tianyin] quickly took a deep breath.
0:23:14|0:23:23|The demon queen held his hand, caressing her own swollen belly slowly and raised her eyes, saying:
0:23:32|0:23:57|While talking, the demon queen used her claws to open the abdomen, [Song Tianyin] looked terrified. The demon queen reached out her tentacles to pry open his mouth, reluctantly glanced at the dragon egg, and stuffed it into his mouth. [Song Tianyin]'s belly quickly swelled, and the usually gentle demon queen suddenly revealed her fangs.
0:23:57|0:24:12|Behind the tree, there is a huge blood demon. It growls lowly and swings its giant fists. The demon queen shows no fear, snarls back, then bravely rushes forward, crazily scratching the blood demon. However, she is knocked away, falling to the ground along with [Song Tianyin].
0:24:13|0:24:19|The blood demon leaped into the air, about to deliver a heavy blow to the two, but [Huo Xiaolan] used a spell to confuse the blood demon.
0:24:21|0:24:27|[Huo Xiaolan] ran forward, a beautiful flying kick made the Blood Demon stagger backwards, then she took out two talismans.
0:24:29|0:24:47|The blood demon's forelimbs were restrained, [Huo Xiaolan] raised her eyebrows triumphantly. The blood demon violently swung its huge tail, narrowly missing [Huo Xiaolan], its forelimbs broke free from the spell and viciously pounced towards [Huo Xiaolan]. [Huo Xiaolan] tied the whip to a big tree, skillfully dodging the attack. She leaped under the tree, making the blood demon furious.
0:24:48|0:24:55|The blood demon wanted to leave, but was caught by a flying whip that tied its feet. [Huo Xiaolan] used a tree trunk to secure the whip, causing the blood demon to fall face down in the mud.
0:24:58|0:25:7|The demon queen cut the rope on [Song Tianyin]'s hand, held his hand, and let him gently stroke her belly.
0:25:11|0:25:34|The demon queen, exhausted, lowered her head. [Song Tianyin] shook her vigorously but got no response. At that moment, [Huo Xiaolan] was being beaten by the blood demon, struggling to catch her breath. [Song Tianyin] hurriedly picked up the whip from the ground to throw to her, but it got tangled around her neck. [Huo Xiaolan] shouted and fiercely stabbed the blood demon's head with her hand, and the blood demon swung its fist.
0:25:34|0:25:51|[Huo Xiaolan] landed in agony after hitting a tree trunk hard, with the Blood Demon closing in on [Song Tianyin]. A slap knocked him down. [Huo Xiaolan] pulled out a knife, flicked the demon away, and grabbed [Song Tianyin]'s leg, hoisting him into the air. [Song Tianyin] screamed in terror: [Huo Xiaolan] rushed forward and fiercely stabbed the knife into the Blood Demon's tail.
0:25:52|0:25:57|[Song Tianyin] fell to the ground, and Blood Demon quickly checked his tail. When he turned back, the two had already escaped.
0:25:58|0:26:2|They rushed towards the entrance they had just arrived from, slipping in just before the blood demon pounced.
0:26:3|0:26:24|The blood demon's head was stuck in the cave entrance and couldn't be pulled out. He reached out to scratch an itch but accidentally touched the wound on his tail, helplessly lying on the ground. In the village, everyone was busy and peaceful. [Ge Qianhu] rode a white horse, grandly entering the village with several Taoist priests following behind. The villagers curiously watched.
0:26:26|0:26:40|Xiao Wu looked around, not knowing the identity of the person. As night fell, Song Tianyin and Luo Gang crawled out of the bed cave exhausted. Song Tianyin, with a big belly, approached Huo Xiaolan and asked. Huo Xiaolan pressed his ear against his belly, furrowing his brow.
0:27:7|0:27:15|[Huo Xiaolan] brought a straw shoe to his mouth, [Song Tianyin] bit the shoe head in confusion, and [Huo Xiaolan] drew a knife towards his neck.
0:27:41|0:27:45|[Song Tianyin] struggled to get up with her belly, while [Huo Xiaolan] satisfactorily sheathed the knife.
0:27:52|0:28:1|[Huo Xiaolan] just stepped in and triggered the mechanism on the floor. Suddenly, darts flew everywhere in the room. She quickly dodged the darts, but before she could steady herself, she was caught in a big net and lifted up to the rafters.
0:28:5|0:28:12|[Huo Xiaolan] grinned as she pulled the net.
0:28:25|0:28:30|[Song Tianyin] left alone with the sack, leaving [Huo Xiaolan] hanging in mid-air, gasping for breath.
0:28:47|0:28:54|The door slowly opens, the camera moves down, and a green little demon looks at her.
0:29:8|0:29:25|Chef Tian Shi, holding a hammer, suddenly appeared and knocked down Xiao Wu. He used an electric hammer to strike Xiao Wu heavily, sending him flying into the air and then falling back down. Song Tianyin hid behind a wooden rack, peeking out and feeling guilty as he made eye contact with Xiao Wu.
0:29:29|0:29:34|Chef Tian Shi approached [Xiao Wu] and carefully examined him, while [Song Tianyin] took the opportunity to leave quietly.
0:29:35|0:29:56|In the room, [Huo Xiaolan] is chanting a spell in the net, and under her body emerges a red paper figure like a window flower. The paper figure calls out several companions and climbs up the big net. They make childlike laughter all the way to the top of the net.
0:29:57|0:30:11|The scene cuts to outside the house, with [Song Tianyin] peeking behind the wall at the gathered villagers, while [Ge Qianhu] sighs in front of the villagers.
0:31:20|0:31:36|[Ge Qianhu] pointed the sword handle at the monster. The short pawnshop mistress smiled and said. A fart came out of the mistress's mouth, followed by a loud, smoky fart. She had already transformed into a monster and burst into laughter, making all the villagers laugh heartily.
0:31:36|0:31:45|Ge Qianhu's henchman released a yellow and black beetle, and the scorpion crawled up the villager's pointed head along his fingertips.
0:31:47|0:31:59|The fire beetle pierced into the villager's temple with its pincers, causing the villager to fall to the ground with half of his head already transformed into a demon. As the fire beetle slowly crawled out from the wound on his head, [Song Tianyin] exclaimed, only to have [Huo Xiaolan] cover her mouth.
0:32:10|0:32:14|His henchmen approached the villagers with weapons, and they used torches to set fire to the plaques and beams in the village.
0:32:20|0:32:36|[Song Tianyin] and [Xiao Wu] watched from the shadows as the villagers were taken away by the celestial masters. [Xiao Wu] fell behind the group and was kicked by Fire Celestial Master for slowing down.
0:33:4|0:33:12|[Song Tianyin], with a big belly and carrying heavy luggage, limped behind [Huo Xiaolan] as they walked out of the village where he was born and raised.
0:33:18|0:33:52|After crossing the river, he stood at the bridgehead, looked back at the houses in the village still emitting smoke, and then turned away. The scene showed a map-like view, with two people walking side by side on a mountain road among towering mountains. After trekking through mountains and rivers, the two rested at an inn, with a tall empty bowl placed in front of [Song Tianyin].
0:33:56|0:34:4|The shopkeeper picked up a bowl of noodles and walked over.
0:34:11|0:34:20|[Huo Xiaolan] awkwardly smiled at the shopkeeper, but then widened her eyes as [Luo Gang] strolled leisurely outside the inn. [Song Tianyin] looked at [Huo Xiaolan] in shock.
0:34:26|0:34:41|[Song Tianyin] buried himself in eating, and was suddenly slapped by [Huo Xiaolan]. With his mouth full of noodles, he left after [Huo Xiaolan] gestured for him to go left, carrying his luggage as he squatted down. [Luo Gang] walked into the shop, glanced at [Huo Xiaolan], then abruptly tried to turn and run out of the shop, only to be stopped by [Huo Xiaolan].
0:35:28|0:35:47|[Huo Xiaolan] decisively left, [Luo Gang] could only sit down at the table, but he noticed a stack of empty bowls on the table. He mocked [Song Tianyin] for his belly, but he still just focused on eating. [Huo Xiaolan] ran over to check on [Song Tianyin] and angrily patted his back.
0:36:5|0:36:13|[Huo Xiaolan] pulled [Song Tianyin] away in a hurry, followed closely by [Luo Gang] with a wicked smile. [Luo Gang] threw the axe towards the two, causing the wooden pole inside the house to collapse.
0:36:14|0:36:18|Huo Xiaolan turned around to see Luo Gang holding an axe to Song Tianyin's neck as everyone started to scatter and flee.
0:36:19|0:36:33|At this moment, [Huo Xiaolan] flew up and kicked, causing [Luo Gang] to hold his leg and howl in pain. [Luo Gang] leaped up to fight back against [Huo Xiaolan], and [Song Tianyin] caught in between was accidentally injured multiple times.
0:36:46|0:36:56|[Luo Gang] turned his head, [Huo Xiaolan] took the opportunity to hit him, but he saw through her plan. [Song Tianyin] quickly covered him. [Huo Xiaolan] kicked [Luo Gang] away, then helped up [Song Tianyin] and protected him behind her.
0:37:0|0:37:14|The rooftop blood demon landed with a bang, aiming to attack [Luo Gang]. After being kicked away, [Luo Gang] crashed through the courtyard wall. [Huo Xiaolan] tried to whip the blood demon, but ended up having her whip thrown aside, breaking a table. As [Luo Gang] regained consciousness amidst the chaos, the blood demon was approaching [Huo Xiaolan].
0:37:15|0:37:38|[Song Tianyin] rushed forward and used his foot to resist the Blood Demon's giant palm. Veins popped on his face, and the protective gear on his leg was shattered by brute force. [Huo Xiaolan] quickly got up and exerted force together. She turned to [Luo Gang] for help, saying, "With one strong push from the Blood Demon, the two of them instantly collapsed." [Luo Gang] broke through the roof and landed behind the Blood Demon, using a net to control its head.
0:37:38|0:37:53|[Huo Xiaolan] supported [Song Tianyin] and staggered backwards, saying directly: She pulled [Song Tianyin] and fled towards the courtyard.
0:37:58|0:38:21|[Huo Xiaolan] turned around and said, then dragged [Song Tianyin] away. The blood demon was jumping around in the courtyard, making a mess of the place. [Luo Gang] shouted in anger: The blood demon was beaten up, with a swollen nose and bruised face, teeth scattered on the ground. He covered his face with his claws, whimpering as he moved away. When he saw [Luo Gang] raising the axe, he immediately fluttered and ran away.
0:38:21|0:38:41|The camera then turned to face [Luo Gang], with half of his face swollen high, as he slowly dropped the axe and collapsed. The sunlight was glaring in the wilderness, with [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] sitting on the carriage like a married couple.
0:38:41|0:39:1|[Song Tianyin] was whistling while mending clothes when he suddenly had a bout of morning sickness. [Huo Xiaolan] quickly patted his back. At that moment, a flock of sheep appeared not far away, creating a serene scene in the mountain night. The map suddenly appeared, showing that the next stop was Shuntian Mansion.
0:39:12|0:39:18|In the hall, after [Pang Ying] and [Zhu Gao] withdrew their gazes, they smiled at each other.
0:39:34|0:39:40|[Huo Xiaolan] walked out of the room gracefully, while [Song Tianyin] leaned against the bed, rubbing his belly.
0:39:42|0:39:49|[Huo Xiaolan] sat down in the lobby and said to the waiter: "A cute little kid suddenly appeared."
0:40:47|0:41:4|[Huo Xiaolan] looked around at the chefs surrounding her, each adorned with many copper coins. Silently, [Huo Xiaolan] put away the only two copper coins she had on her. Inside the room, [Song Tianyin] lay on his side, groaning and clutching his stomach. Behind him, [Pang Ying] and [Zhu Gao] quickly hid as soon as he turned over.
0:41:4|0:41:15|[Song Tianyin] writhed in pain, [Pang Ying] and another person approached with joy on their faces. [Song Tianyin] was shocked to see them, [Zhu Gao] struck [Song Tianyin] unconscious with a palm, and the two carried him out the door.
0:41:21|0:41:23|[Huo Xiaolan] stood at the door and quickly immobilized the two of them with a talisman.
0:41:24|0:41:38|[Huo Xiaolan] locked the two of them in the cabinet, quickly waking up [Song Tianyin]. [Huo Xiaolan] vigilantly looked outside the door, while [Song Tianyin] struggled to sit up, only to be hit by a wave of pain that made him grit his teeth and groan.
0:41:57|0:42:4|Song Tianyin struggled to prop himself up in pain, while Huo Xiaolan rushed to the door but then turned back.
0:42:8|0:42:16|[Huo Xiaolan] was so anxious that she scratched her head, while the demon egg in her belly was tossing and turning, making [Song Tianyin] roll back and forth in distress.
0:42:25|0:42:30|[Huo Xiaolan] brought hot water and a bundle of scissors, professionally wiping the sweat off [Song Tianyin].
0:42:48|0:43:1|[Song Tianyin] was in so much pain that his features were all scrunched up. [Huo Xiaolan] knelt at the foot of the bed, supporting [Song Tianyin]'s legs and pulling down his pants.
0:43:9|0:43:17|[Huo Xiaolan] approached [Song Tianyin] but couldn't bear to look directly at him, she squinted again under the burlap to search.
0:43:30|0:43:35|[Huo Xiaolan] buried her head in the blanket, holding the scissors close to herself.
0:43:44|0:43:48|[Song Tianyin] suddenly took a deep breath and bit his finger hard, struggling.
0:43:56|0:44:3|[Zheng Tao] and Mrs. Zheng, holding Niu Niu, arrived at the door.
0:44:15|0:44:20|Mrs. Zheng pushed the door open a crack.
0:44:55|0:45:14|[Song Tianyin] tilted his head back and spat out an egg-shaped object from his mouth. [Huo Xiaolan] swiftly knocked out Mrs. Zheng who was about to speak. The egg-shaped object bounced around in four places in the room. It evaded Huo Xiaolan who was waiting under the chair, then popped out legs and a tail, dashed towards the door but was knocked down.
0:45:14|0:45:24|[Huo Xiaolan] lifted the tail and carefully observed it. The egg-shaped object sprouted four tentacles and a baby-like head with green leaves.
0:45:26|0:45:53|[Huo Xiaolan] carried it into the room with one hand, the cute little demon king blinked its eyes. Tianyin turned and asked [Huo Xiaolan], who reluctantly said: [Huo Xiaolan] tentatively reached out her index finger and touched the little demon king's hand. The little demon king suddenly sprayed water on her shoulder.
0:45:54|0:45:57|The inquiry at the door left [Song Tianyin] and the other person looking at each other in surprise.
0:46:50|0:46:57|[Song Tianyin] quickly learned two cries of a baby and called for [Zhu Gao] to be dragged into the room.
0:47:4|0:47:20|At this moment, [Niu Jieshi] was squatting in the room playing with the little demon king. Suddenly, he slapped the little demon king, [Song Tianyin] rushed up to quickly hold [Niu Jieshi] back, but when she turned around, the little demon king had disappeared.
0:47:21|0:47:29|[Niu Jieshi] lay on his back tightly holding onto the tail of the Little Demon King as he was dragged around, while [Song Tianyin] crawled closely behind but was bumped into the bed frame.
0:47:30|0:47:49|[Niu Jieshi] was stopped by [Song Tianyin] when he picked up the scissors. In the struggle, the scissors were accidentally flung and stabbed right into [Pang Ying]'s right shoulder. [Zhu Gao] was heartbroken to see this, his face twitching in pain. Little did he know that the scissors flung by [Song Tianyin] immediately pierced into his own chest.
0:47:51|0:48:7|The little demon king dragged [Niu Jieshi] up to the roof beam, [Song Tianyin] was in a panic, and [Zheng Tao] smiled reassuringly. [Song Tianyin] placed a chair on the table and climbed up to the roof beam, [Niu Jieshi] threw the little demon king onto a distant beam, and walked alone to the middle of the roof beam.
0:48:8|0:48:22|Outside the house, [Zheng Tao] stared at the dark figure climbing on the beam. [Huo Xiaolan] immediately used acupressure to make her faint.
0:48:25|0:48:39|[Song Tianyin] accidentally slipped from the beam, [Niu Jieshi] intercepted the little demon king on the beam. The little demon king was scared and ran back and forth on the beam. Unexpectedly, while running, it accidentally stepped on [Song Tianyin]'s arm and bumped into [Niu Jieshi]'s leg.
0:48:39|0:48:57|[Song Tianyin] struggled to climb back onto the beam, while [Niu Jieshi] was bouncing on the beam, gradually moving towards the center. [Song Tianyin] stealthily approached him. Suddenly, [Niu Jieshi] slipped and fell, and [Song Tianyin] quickly grabbed him, leaving both of them hanging upside down on the beam.
0:48:58|0:49:6|Song Tianyin's feet slipped on the cow dung and fell to the ground, Zheng Tao rushed towards the door upon hearing the noise.
0:49:7|0:49:12|[Song Tianyin] quickly handed [Niu Jieshi] to him and closed the door, while [Huo Xiaolan] watched as [Zheng Tao] carried [Niu Jieshi] away.
0:49:13|0:49:30|[Song Tianyin] sat panting next to the door, and the little demon king ran over to lean against him, creating a warm scene. Beside the sheep pen at night, someone was whispering secretly.
0:49:40|0:49:53|[Pang Ying] and [Zhu Gao] blinked wildly. [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] continued on their way with their luggage, arriving at an abandoned stone house where [Huo Xiaolan] pushed open the door.
0:49:54|0:50:8|Sunlight streamed into the room, illuminating the deity on the stone wall. [Song Tianyin] opened the swaddle, revealing the little demon king in his arms with tightly closed eyes.
0:50:9|0:50:15|He hurriedly ran towards [Huo Xiaolan], who took the little demon king and touched its forehead.
0:50:17|0:50:24|Song Tianyin hurriedly pulled out a piece of blue cloth from the luggage and handed it over.
0:50:26|0:50:51|He hurried to the water pool inside to fetch water, put a wet cloth on the head of the little demon king, and steam immediately rose. [Song Tianyin] shuttled back and forth between the water pool and the bed, while [Huo Xiaolan] wrung out the linen to apply to the little demon king's head. The little demon king suddenly sprayed saliva on himself.
0:50:54|0:51:9|The little demon king slowly opened his eyes, and [Huo Xiaolan] smiled with relief. [Song Tianyin] sat down next to the weak little demon king and made faces at it.
0:51:14|0:51:31|Song Tianyin's cockeyed look made the little demon king giggle, while Huo Xiaolan looked at the playful Song Tianyin thoughtfully. At this moment, the drowsy little demon king was gestured by Huo Xiaolan to stop making noise, and soon the little demon king fell asleep soundly. Song Tianyin and Huo Xiaolan quietly watched it.
0:51:32|0:51:56|Outside the house, two horses were lazily sunbathing, while the little demon king inside the house was making gestures at the edge of the bed in his sleep. Sitting by his feet were three little window flower people. The little demon king accidentally fell off the bed. [Song Tianyin] hurried over to catch him, and [Huo Xiaolan] touched his head and said:
0:52:39|0:53:8|[Huo Xiaolan] took the little demon king and held him in her arms, taking a deep breath. [Song Tianyin] turned around and smiled with relief. Seeing the window puppet people watching around, [Huo Xiaolan] frowned in worry. Suddenly, she had an idea as her eyes lit up, and she turned around and said:
0:53:22|0:53:33|She suddenly opened [Song Tianyin]'s clothes, allowing the little demon king to suck blood, and the screams of [Song Tianyin] could be heard outside the house. Mrs. Zheng sat in the moving sedan chair, with a vacant look in her eyes, saying:
0:53:58|0:54:15|He saw [Luo Gang] with four broken copper coins hanging from his chest, a slight smile on his lips. The midday sun shone through the leaves as [Song Tianyin] picked wild fruits in the woods, tasting and picking at the same time.
0:54:18|0:54:24|The camera cuts to two horses falling to the ground, with [Huo Xiaolan] standing with crossed arms on the side saying:
0:54:27|0:54:50|The little demon king turned his tentacles to please with a smile. [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] both glared at it angrily. It shrank into an egg shape on the spot, looking wronged, and [Song Tianyin] patiently squatted down to instruct it, saying:
0:55:22|0:55:35|The little demon obediently ate the wild fruit, looking very happy. It happily ate the second fruit, as [Song Tianyin] looked at the horse and said.
0:55:37|0:55:52|[Song Tianyin] fed the wild fruit to the little demon king one after another, making the demon king's cheeks bulging. [Song Tianyin] watched with delight. Suddenly, a wild fruit shot out of its mouth, hitting a hole in the pillar on the lawn.
0:55:54|0:56:14|Its mouth sprayed wild fruits like a machine gun, [Song Tianyin] hid beside [Huo Xiaolan] and the grass pavilion collapsed with a bang. [Huo Xiaolan] stood with hands on hips, looking at [Song Tianyin], who silently withdrew his hand, while the little demon king laughed heartily. The two of them looked at it in silence.
0:56:14|0:56:34|In the stone cave, the little demon king was jumping and playing with the window flower figurines. [Huo Xiaolan] was wiping the peach-shaped object on the stone table, which was yellow with branch-like patterns on the surface. [Song Tianyin] curiously walked up to her and sat down.
0:57:2|0:57:9|The mischievous little demon king suddenly stopped playing and looked at [Huo Xiaolan]. [Song Tianyin] recalled:
0:57:34|0:57:45|The little demon king quickly stole a piece of cloth from the table. [Huo Xiaolan] noticed and scolded it, while [Song Tianyin] pointed at the peach heart and reached out his hand.
0:57:46|0:58:6|[Huo Xiaolan] handed it to him with half belief, and [Song Tianyin] took the peach heart and blew it up. The little demon king shrank in the corner, looking extremely cute as if he was about to excrete.
0:58:44|0:58:52|The little demon king still refused to eat the pear fed to him by [Song Tianyin]. [Huo Xiaolan] brought [Song Tianyin]'s hand to its mouth, and just as it was about to bite, it saw [Song Tianyin]'s expression and closed its mouth.
0:59:38|0:59:44|The little demon king slept between [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan], lifting [Huo Xiaolan]'s hand and covering it with [Song Tianyin]'s hand while in a dream.
0:59:45|0:59:54|The night was quiet in the valley. The river of Shuntian Mansion meandered, with houses lined up in order.
1:0:0|1:0:17|In front of the Hongyun Teahouse, bustling with noise and excitement, a parade is passing by. In the parade, a person carrying a huge horn and wearing a painted mask walks by. Another person, dressed as a crane with tassels all over, walks on stilts and waves his arms. The little demon king in the basket watches them through the cracks.
1:0:18|1:0:34|[Huo Xiaolan] and [Song Tianyin] walked beside the team, looking around. They walked one after the other in the market. As [Song Tianyin] walked, he saw children sitting on the roadside stalls, showing off as they ate sugar paintings.
1:0:34|1:0:41|He thought for a moment and couldn't help but look at the little demon king in the basket. [Huo Xiaolan] patted [Song Tianyin] and gestured for him to hurry along.
1:1:5|1:1:18|[Pawnshop Mistress] looked under the table again, but the bald men were swapping cards on the table. She picked up a card, saw the pattern on it, and smugly added it to her own hand.
1:1:19|1:1:24|Three bald men are celebrating, while [Huo Xiaolan] and [Song Tianyin] are watching on the side.
1:1:25|1:1:32|The Pawnshop Mistress noticed the bald men avoiding eye contact and went to check the cards on the table.
1:1:35|1:1:40|Extend all hands, the three bald men each raise four hands, and the mahjong tiles in their sleeves are all hanging on the table.
1:1:42|1:1:48|Three bald men with ankle chains were reluctant to go upstairs, [Huo Xiaolan] deliberately coughed.
1:1:52|1:2:6|The Pawnshop Mistress raised her eyebrows and smiled when she saw the two copper coins on Huo Xiaolan's chest. Song Tianyin placed the little demon king in front of the Pawnshop Mistress.
1:2:8|1:2:30|The Pawnshop Mistress opened the wanted poster which described the features of the demon fetus: round head, pointed ears, golden eyes, moss on top, and so on. Song Tianyin chuckled as he picked up the little demon king, but the Pawnshop Mistress quickly stopped him.
1:2:36|1:2:54|The pawnshop mistress looked at him in disbelief, then casually said: She used a fan to mark a spot, then walked out of the room and closed the iron door. Huo Xiaolan extended her arms to Song Tianyin.
1:2:58|1:3:10|She rolled her eyes and put down her arms. [Song Tianyin] looked at the little demon king in his arms and said regretfully. [Huo Xiaolan] lowered her eyes and stretched out her arms again.
1:3:11|1:3:19|Huo Xiaolan deftly turned around as the little demon king reached out his tentacles for a hug, and Song Tianyin carefully placed the little demon king on the ground.
1:3:32|1:3:44|[Huo Xiaolan] remained silent as [Song Tianyin] took a deep breath and said, "[Song Tianyin] rushed towards the cage, the little demon king chased after him, shaking his body, seeking praise."
1:3:50|1:4:19|[Song Tianyin] demonstrated for the little demon king by squeezing his whole body into the cage, but unexpectedly, he was locked inside by the little demon king. [Huo Xiaolan] almost burst out laughing. [Song Tianyin] squatted by the cage again and said, "I didn't expect [Huo Xiaolan] to kick it into the cage with one foot, quickly close the door, and sit in the cage with the little demon king looking all dejected."
1:4:25|1:4:36|[Huo Xiaolan] took a few steps and then stopped, [Song Tianyin] glanced at the cage and said, "Turn around, the little demon in the cage is full of energy."
1:4:37|1:4:46|[Huo Xiaolan] chuckled lightly and quickly suppressed her smile.
1:5:19|1:5:36|The pawnshop mistress pasted a talisman on the cage. She handed the heavy silver to [Huo Xiaolan], who glanced at [Song Tianyin]. He took the silver, and [Song Tianyin] looked back at the cage.
1:5:39|1:5:46|The little demon king rushed forward, only to be shocked by the cage and smoke. [Song Tianyin] was about to step forward but was stopped by the Pawnshop Mistress.
1:5:52|1:5:58|[Huo Xiaolan] turned decisively and walked away, while [Song Tianyin] also shouldered his luggage to leave.
1:5:59|1:6:20|The little demon king hurriedly grabbed the cage, but was shocked and powerless. [Song Tianyin] walked to the door and then turned back. The little demon king seemed to see hope, [Song Tianyin] left with a frown, and the little demon king burst into laughter, crying loudly.
1:6:30|1:6:36|In the restaurant, a sumptuous meal was laid out in front of [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan].
1:6:38|1:6:51|[Song Tianyin] looked at the child at the next table eating with his parents and suddenly said, "[Huo Xiaolan]" bowed her head and remained silent, and neither of them touched their chopsticks.
1:6:53|1:7:18|The bright moonlight shines through the window of the pawnshop, illuminating the room where Huo Xiaolan sits alone in a cage. Looking out the window, she hugs herself tightly, feeling lonely in the cage. The darkness of the night cannot hide the sadness on Huo Xiaolan's face. The next day,...
1:7:18|1:7:25|The sky was getting bright, and the [Pawnshop Mistress] approached the cage of Huoba and revealed two cards.
1:7:26|1:7:45|Huo Ba hesitantly used his tentacles to play mahjong, awkwardly smiling, while [Pawnshop Mistress] rolled her eyes in silence. The market was crowded, with monkey vendors shouting as monkeys, squirrels, and dogs were locked in cages.
1:7:45|1:8:12|[Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] walk through the market, where stalls are filled with freshly slaughtered animals. [Huo Xiaolan] suddenly notices a piece of torn cloth hanging on a basket on someone's back. He pulls out the cloth and unfolds it, and the camera cuts to the scene where Hoba was biting this piece of cloth in the corner, revealing a hollow pattern of a family of three.
1:8:12|1:8:21|[Huo Xiaolan] and [Song Tianyin] looked at each other in embarrassment as a vendor sliced white radishes on the cutting board, each cut making them tremble with guilt.
1:8:43|1:8:52|[Huo Xiaolan] and the Pawnshop Mistress wait anxiously.
1:9:12|1:9:20|The majestic Mountaineering Tower is guarded by two small attendants at the front. As the camera moves up, the building is a mix of yellow and green with intricate patterns.
1:9:26|1:9:36|In the building, the five big characters of "Exterminate Demons First" are prominently displayed, and the chefs are busy. The corner is filled with cages, and two children are watching from inside the cages.
1:9:53|1:10:0|Huo Xiaolan also puffed up her cheeks like her. A chef opened the cages of two children.
1:10:9|1:10:22|Chef Tian Shi from Dengxian Building walked over confidently, combing his hair in front of the mirror.
1:10:52|1:10:58|Chef Tian Shi took the double knives and spun them in the air before stopping.
1:12:9|1:12:20|The scalding hot oil pan made Huoba feel scared, and the chef let it slip into the oil pan.
1:12:23|1:12:31|On the street, [Zhu Gao] and [Pang Ying] exchange glances with each other, swaggering towards the De Xian Tower.
1:12:38|1:13:3|Two people happily enter the building. In the kitchen, Chef Tian Shi and the chefs look on in confusion as oil bubbles slowly rise from the center of the pot. Suddenly, Huoba spits out a mouthful of oil, laughing and splashing around in the pot. Huoba joyfully swims in the oil pot, and several chefs are burned by the splattering oil.
1:13:22|1:13:29|Luo Gang carried a dog over to Pang Ying.
1:13:50|1:13:59|[Huo Xiaolan] and [Song Tianyin] peeked out from behind the wall, carefully observing. [Huo Xiaolan] signaled for [Song Tianyin] to move out, and the two of them cautiously approached a wall.
1:14:0|1:14:13|On the wall, there is a demon face with numbers on its four sides, with a hand-held ring. [Song Tianyin] cautiously knocks on the ring, then suddenly inserts her two fingers into the closed demon eye.
1:14:26|1:14:41|Slowly rotating, it points to three numbers in turn, 438. [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] cautiously enter, and the wall slowly closes again.
1:14:42|1:14:55|Chef Tian Shi looked proudly at the smoking jar in front of him after bandaging his burn. Suddenly, he felt something was wrong, and the jar exploded instantly.
1:14:58|1:15:8|Inflated Hu Ba flew around the room like a deflating balloon. The chefs were covered in pieces of broken jars, and the head chef was lying on the ground shaking his legs.
1:16:7|1:16:12|The master washed his hands and picked up two knives.
1:16:14|1:16:32|Huo Ba saw the sharp knife and immediately curled up into a ball. [Pawnshop Mistress] confidently closed her eyes and chopped Huo Ba on the cutting board. Huo Ba was chopped into a scallion pancake.
1:16:33|1:16:56|Huo Ba was put into the steamer, [Pang Ying] hurriedly came to meet with [Zhu Gao], the two looked around cautiously and left. Unexpectedly, [Luo Gang] holding a dog, followed closely behind them, the unrecognizable [Pawnshop Mistress] and others guarding the steamer ready to be cooked.
1:16:58|1:17:8|The Pawnshop Mistress stepped forward to take a look, only to see Hu Ba sticking out his tongue and jumping around.
1:17:16|1:17:22|Huo Ba sprayed out a puff of steam, leaving [Pawnshop Mistress] covered in flour on her face.
1:17:28|1:17:41|The two childlike demons are still marinating. They sneakily discover that no one is around and escape with the marinating pot.
1:17:51|1:18:9|The two kitchen chefs looked at each other, Hu Ba was stuck on the special food cart for raw demon brains. [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] cautiously sneaked into the kitchen. The room was dim and eerie, with slaughtered demons hanging everywhere.
1:18:14|1:18:21|[Song Tianyin] suddenly saw a demon hanging on the ceiling, and he walked forward with sadness in his eyes.
1:18:25|1:18:27|Song Tianyin immediately rushed into the kitchen.
1:18:29|1:18:38|[Song Tianyin] saw Xiao Wu was still alive, immediately grabbed a big shovel to drive away the henchmen, and joyfully unlocked Xiao Wu's chains.
1:18:46|1:19:0|A hammer flew straight at Song Tianyin, and he dodged it by crouching down. Chef Tian Shi appeared, wielding the hammer and striking at Song Tianyin, who struggled to defend himself against Chef Tian Shi's attacks.
1:19:3|1:19:12|Chef Tian Shi dodged the copper furnace thrown by Song Tianyin. At this moment, Xiao Wu grabbed Chef Tian Shi's leg, and Aunt Li knocked him down with a fierce push.
1:19:23|1:19:40|[Song Tianyin] tried to turn around but accidentally stepped on a stick, causing him to lose balance and fall towards [Huo Xiaolan]. Their lips met as their eyes locked. [Huo Xiaolan] quickly withdrew her hand from [Song Tianyin]'s shoulder, and they innocently blinked their eyes as they slowly separated.
1:19:40|1:19:55|[Huo Xiaolan] seemed to have not reacted yet, [Song Tianyin] sweetly smiled and turned away. In the kitchen, both [Aunt Li] and [Song Tianyin] were no match for [Chef Tian Shi]. [Huo Xiaolan] rushed over and grabbed the hammer with a whip.
1:20:6|1:20:22|[Huo Xiaolan] was kicked down by [Chef Tian Shi], [Song Tianyin] took the opportunity to knock out [Chef Tian Shi]. He kicked him onto the fruit and vegetable stand. [Song Tianyin] crawled towards [Huo Xiaolan] and Xiao Wu helped Aunt Li to leave slowly.
1:21:7|1:21:12|The firewood in the stove gradually rose into the air, transforming into a large fireball with sparks flying.
1:21:16|1:21:26|Chef Tian Shi manipulated a fireball chasing Song Tianyin and Huo Xiaolan, the fireball roared like a giant beast's gaping mouth, knocking over the braziers at the door.
1:21:27|1:21:36|[Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] split up after running into the prison cell. Fireball decisively chased after [Song Tianyin] and cornered him against the wall, but he managed to dodge and escape in a panic.
1:21:40|1:21:47|[Huo Xiaolan] discovered the fire talisman on [Song Tianyin]'s back and immediately removed it, throwing it onto Chef Tian Shi who happened to arrive just in time.
1:21:54|1:22:2|Chef Tian Shi was knocked down by a fireball, Huo Xiaolan took the opportunity to grab the key from him and opened the cell door for the Pawnshop Mistress.
1:22:4|1:22:12|[Song Tianyin] solemnly handed the key to [Pawnshop Mistress], who watched them leave.
1:22:14|1:22:25|The locked food cart with Huo Xiaolan inside was sent into the elevator, and the chef helped to push the gate. Huo Xiaolan slowly ascended with the elevator.
1:22:27|1:22:40|[Zhu Gao] and [Pang Ying] cautiously walk in the corridor, they open the door of the elevator. The cargo box is slowly rising in the aisle, and the two smile at each other.
1:22:41|1:22:49|While [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] were sneaking into the kitchen, [Pang Ying] and the two transformed back into their demon forms, slowly climbing up to the loft.
1:22:52|1:23:10|Two demons saw Hu Ba and their faces lit up with joy. The two demons grabbed the bottom of the ladder. [Luo Gang] noticed the human skin left behind by [Pang Ying] and set down the little dog in his arms, standing on the straight ladder and looking down.
1:23:15|1:23:24|He leaped down, landing heavily in the stairwell, and Zhu Gao peeked out and saw Luo Gang.
1:23:25|1:23:40|[Luo Gang] pulled the rope to the two monsters, [Luo Gang] swung his knife towards [Zhu Gao], and the ladder compartment moved accordingly.
1:23:42|1:23:59|[Zhu Gao] climbed with [Pang Ying] on his back, only to find [Luo Gang] right above them. They took turns attacking [Luo Gang], who used his legs to hold onto the wall and prevent himself from falling. Just then, the elevator arrived and Hu Ba was pulled out by a maid.
1:24:2|1:24:10|[Luo Gang] is no match for [Zhu Gao] and [Pang Ying]. The two demons coordinate perfectly, pushing [Luo Gang] back step by step. [Pang Ying] sits on [Luo Gang]'s shoulders and pounds him.
1:24:10|1:24:28|Jumping to a high place, giving him a fierce push, they were fighting, and all three fell in the straight ladder passage. Two of them saw the box ladder falling and jumped out of the passage, but unexpectedly [Luo Gang] was still in the passage.
1:24:34|1:24:53|At the critical moment, two demons dragged out [Luo Gang], who was rescued and showed a smile. Meanwhile, not far away, Chef Tian Shi woke up and used a big hammer to strike [Zhu Gao].
1:24:54|1:24:58|[Luo Gang] took the axe from [Zhu Gao] and assumed a fighting stance.
1:25:1|1:25:20|Luo Gang and Chef Tian Shi fought, while the two demons took turns attacking nearby, cooperating seamlessly. As they battled on one side, a maid pushed a food cart slowly carrying Hu Xiaolan in on the other side.
1:25:54|1:26:10|On the other side, Song Tianyin and Luo Gang arrived in the kitchen and found some movement in the basket of vegetables. The two of them helped Grandma out of the basket.
1:27:22|1:27:33|A bug crawled on top of [Huo Xiaolan]'s head, followed by a group of window flower little people flying into the shop. After they stood in front of [Huo Xiaolan], they threw the live beetle into the air and beat it up.
1:27:34|1:27:42|But unexpectedly, Chef Tian Shi waved his fan and sent them flying. Huo Xiaolan and Luo Gang rushed into the hall, she used a hook to pull back Hu Ba.
1:27:43|1:27:48|The turn-around attack was blocked.
1:27:49|1:28:13|[Huo Xiaolan] rushed to the dining table and fought with [Chef Tian Shi] in two steps and three steps. [Song Tianyin] patted [Ge Qianhu]'s face, who was already drunk and disoriented. [Song Tianyin] first unfastened the buckle of the food cart and picked up [Ge Qianhu], while [Huo Xiaolan] was kicked and sent flying to the ground.
1:28:23|1:28:43|[Huo Xiaolan] threw a smoke bomb, causing everyone to lose their direction in the smoke. Suddenly, [Chef Tian Shi] was pulled back and he quickly counterattacked. [Huo Xiaolan] was unable to move in the swirling wind, but [Ge Qianhu] laughed.
1:29:39|1:29:52|[Grandma] recited a spell with her mouth and made a move with her hand, causing the utensils on the table to float in mid-air. After a few seconds, all the utensils fell down, and [Chef Tian Shi] waved at her.
1:30:41|1:30:47|[Song Tianyin] slowly walked out, covering [Huo Xiaolan]'s mouth.
1:30:56|1:30:59|[Song Tianyin] looked at [Grandma] and [Huo Xiaolan], both of them gazing at [Song Tianyin] with difficulty.
1:31:1|1:31:18|[Song Tianyin] suddenly smiled and said, uncovering [Huo Xiaolan]'s mouth, which was shooting fruits like a machine gun. [Grandma] and [Huo Xiaolan] landed safely, while [Chef Tian Shi] and the guests scattered to avoid them.
1:31:19|1:31:34|[Huo Xiaolan] spits out fruit while making a face, propelling [Song Tianyin] parallel to the ground. [Song Tianyin] attacks while sliding on a chair with [Huo Xiaolan] on his back, causing both Grandma and [Huo Xiaolan] to cover their heads and crouch down, while Chef Tian Shi leaps to the second floor.
1:31:35|1:31:51|Just as he reached the second floor, he was hit in the face by a durian and fell to the ground. [Song Tianyin] instructed Hu Ba to continue eating fruit as ammunition, and shortly after, he came out again to fire. Ge Qianhu's headgear was knocked off by the fruit, and he spun into the air, landing firmly on the table.
1:31:51|1:32:8|Huo Ba, exhausted and sticking out his tongue, was taunted by [Ge Qianhu]. A cut suddenly appeared on his left cheek, and [Ge Qianhu], with an incredulous look, touched it. Just as he was about to react, a blood mark also appeared on his right cheek.
1:32:11|1:32:29|[Song Tianyin] looked at him puzzled, and everyone stood up to watch. At that moment, [Ge Qianhu]'s face twitched and began to change wildly. One face after another popped out on his face, and after he put out 5 faces in a row, he fell down weakly.
1:32:34|1:32:44|[Ge Qianhu] turned into a gray-skinned monster covered in mushrooms. He timidly curled up and then suddenly expanded.
1:32:51|1:32:58|Song Tianyin shattered the stone pillar.
1:33:0|1:33:9|He overturned the banquet, causing [Song Tianyin] and others to fall heavily to the ground. [Chef Tian Shi], holding a musical instrument, gathered together and launched a sonic attack against [Ge Qianhu].
1:33:10|1:33:20|He roared and smashed the long table, throwing all the [Chef Tian Shi]s out.
1:33:22|1:33:39|[Grandma] rushed up and fiercely stomped on [Ge Qianhu]'s small paw, then stood with hands on hips glaring at him. [Ge Qianhu] slapped her, sending her flying. [Grandma] crashed through the fence. The little demon who usually followed [Ge Qianhu] closely flew over, but was immediately scared away by his madness.
1:33:40|1:33:47|[Huo Xiaolan] used a whip to tie [Ge Qianhu]'s neck to a stone in an attempt to control him.
1:33:51|1:34:9|Who would have expected that the stone pillar was shattered by [Ge Qianhu] with brute force. [Song Tianyin] used a pipa to hit him, but the pipa was broken in the process. Throwing a banana, it landed in [Ge Qianhu]'s nostrils, causing him to spray out the banana, which unexpectedly sent [Song Tianyin] flying.
1:34:10|1:34:19|[Ge Qianhu] grabbed four [Chef Tian Shi], exerted force to slam them against the wall, while [Grandma] approached [Song Tianyin] with a sword.
1:34:28|1:34:45|Tianyin watched as Ge Qianhu caused a commotion. He jumped onto the roof beam, spun around, and landed, kicking Chef Tian Shi who was flying towards him. Tianyin, holding a rusty sword, attempted to strike Ge Qianhu, but Ge Qianhu held the sword with both hands, rendering him unable to move.
1:34:45|1:34:54|He immediately punched him against the pillar, Tianyin groaned in pain, [Huo Xiaolan] rubbed his face in confusion, and [Ge Qianhu] began laughing hysterically.
1:34:56|1:35:2|The sword struck Song Tianyin's chest directly.
1:35:48|1:36:20|[Huo Xiaolan] could no longer contain her hatred. [Huo Ba] cautiously approached Tianyin and saw the sword stuck in his body. Trembling, [Huo Ba] climbed onto him. [Huo Ba] carefully walked over and stood firmly on Tianyin. Using its delicate tentacles, it pulled out the rusty sword, getting wounded in the process.
1:36:21|1:36:37|The sword was finally pulled out, and Huoba's blood was spilled on the ground. Song Tianyin's meridians suddenly surged, revealing a faint golden color. The sword on the ground absorbed Huo Xiaolan's blood, and all the rust disappeared.
1:36:37|1:36:56|In an instant, the light shone brightly, and the bloodstains on the ground sprouted tender grass. [Song Tianyin] suddenly jerked awake. Mrs. Zheng protected Zheng Tao underneath her, holding up a wooden board to warn [Ge Qianhu]. In the chaos, she even released a hidden weapon that injured Ge Qianhu's eye.
1:36:57|1:37:4|[Huo Xiaolan] leaped into the air and stabbed towards [Ge Qianhu]'s eyes with a dagger, but was thrown back to the ground by him.
1:37:8|1:37:14|At a critical moment, [Song Tianyin] slashed with a sword and pierced its claw, while [Ge Qianhu] jumped frantically while holding his foot.
1:37:17|1:37:21|[Song Tianyin] immediately displayed his moves, completing the entire Song Family's Ten Moves.
1:37:22|1:37:41|The sword immediately glowed red, as if it had just been forged, and [Song Tianyin] rushed towards [Ge Qianhu] with the sword. The sword, emitting hot flames, stabbed straight into [Ge Qianhu]'s belly.
1:37:42|1:37:49|[Song Tianyin] kicked up his feet, kicking [Ge Qianhu] in the belly and drew out his sword.
1:37:50|1:37:59|Ge Qianhu's belly was burned bright red, he howled and crashed into the pillar, falling heavily to the ground. Huo Xiaolan helped Song Tianyin up.
1:38:0|1:38:16|After saying that, [Ge Qianhu] gasped for breath. In the cell, [Luo Gang] and the others worked together to push Chef Tian Shi into the cage. Exhausted, [Luo Gang] sat on the ground, while [Pang Ying] and [Zhu Gao] also gathered around.
1:38:17|1:38:28|The two demons exchanged a glance and both kissed Luo Gang's cheek together.
1:38:32|1:38:47|[Luo Gang] chuckled foolishly as he watched the two demons disappear from sight. Inside the shop, [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] helped up [Grandma].
1:38:50|1:38:58|[Huo Xiaolan] pointed silently at [Song Tianyin], leaving [Grandma] feeling awkward.
1:39:28|1:39:35|The little demon was startled and quickly flew away. [Grandma] pulled back the intricate patterned curtains and leaped down.
1:39:39|1:39:42|[Huo Xiaolan] and [Song Tianyin] smiled at each other as they watched [Grandma] walk away.
1:39:43|1:39:50|In the Lantern Tower, the lanterns were askew, and the banquet hall was filled with corpses. [Pang Ying] and [Zhu Gao] saw the mess in the dining car.
1:39:56|1:40:15|[Pang Ying] and [Zhu Gao] embraced each other, crying in pain. The villagers of Yongning Village in the valley stood at the intersection, looking at [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan].
1:40:21|1:40:28|Xiao Wu and two older ladies stood at the front of the line, [Huo Xiaolan] blinked and turned to [Song Tianyin].
1:40:54|1:41:11|[Huo Xiaolan] instantly disappeared, [Huo Xiaolan] suddenly popped out from behind [Song Tianyin] happily spinning in circles. [Song Tianyin] smiled at it and then patted its shoulder.
1:41:22|1:41:30|[Huo Ba] heard his name and extended his tentacles, shaking his body. [Song Tianyin] slowly stood up and said:
1:41:41|1:41:59|[Huo Ba], who reached out his tentacles wanting a hug, was instantly scared silly by [Song Tianyin]. [Song Tianyin] drew a circle of flames with his sword, forcing [Huo Ba] to leave him.
1:42:7|1:42:14|Memories resurface, the way his father drove him away years ago, mirroring the current situation with [Song Tianyin].
1:42:16|1:42:33|[Huo Xiaolan] reached out tentacles to wipe away tears, turned around and walked away silently. At the corner leading into the mountains, it quietly glanced back at [Song Tianyin], wiped away tears, and left. [Huo Xiaolan] walked to [Song Tianyin]'s side, looked at [Huo Xiaolan], and said:
1:43:3|1:43:9|[Huo Xiaolan] carried the luggage on her back and sighed as she swung her arms.
1:43:25|1:43:34|[Huo Xiaolan] grabbed [Song Tianyin]'s arm as if to bite him, then playfully let go.
1:43:43|1:43:50|Huo Xiaolan and Aunt Li are walking together on the grass, with Aunt Li saying in the distance:
1:45:16|1:45:26|A group of little trumpet monsters are dancing neatly in the valley.
