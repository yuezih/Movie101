0:1:59|0:2:8|The racing car, speeding along the forest road, roared loudly. Guided by the navigator, [Xu Tailang] smoothly passed one dangerous curve after another.
0:2:16|0:2:34|[Xu Tailang], wearing a heavy helmet, stared ahead earnestly, while the staff on the track were busy directing. Data on the computer kept updating, but [Xu Tailang] was not distracted by the people around him, his eyes fixed on the screen. The high-speed racing car kicked up a cloud of dust and gravel as [Xu Tailang] inside the car focused intently on the road ahead.
0:2:34|0:2:39|Skillfully drifting through every huge curve in the race car, [Xu Tailang] showed no sign of slowing down with his hands and feet.
0:2:39|0:3:2|With the changing road conditions, deftly switching between the brake and the accelerator, the race car quickly drove down the mountain road and entered a section of track filled with sand and rocks. The blue Subaru race car raced on this extremely uneven mountain road, with the scenery on both sides quickly receding backwards. The mountain road was rugged and steep, and even a small mistake could lead to the race car veering off the narrow road and plummeting off the cliff.
0:3:2|0:3:19|Even in such thrilling road conditions, [Xu Tailang] drove the race car without slowing down at all. The car was tossed left and right by the gravel, the rapidly spinning wheels kicked up a cloud of dust, making the sun less glaring. The car continued to race on the sandy road among the bushes.
0:3:19|0:3:34|The road under the wheels is constantly changing, sometimes smooth asphalt, sometimes gravel road, sometimes even in the middle of the grass. [Xu Tailang] looks ahead firmly, as colorful fireworks burst at the finish line of the race track.
0:3:34|0:3:43|[Xu Tailang]â€™s racing car crossed the finish line, and the team members were all smiles, expressing their inner joy and happiness by clapping and fist bumping.
0:3:44|0:3:59|The racing car drove through the cheering crowd on both sides and stopped. The door was surrounded by people, and [Xu Tailang] took off his helmet, cheered, got out of the car, and hugged his teammates. At that moment, a reporter handed the microphone to [Xu Tailang].
0:5:6|0:5:20|Amidst the cheers of the crowd, the father covered his mouth and turned away, while [Xu Tailang] also raised his hands in joy and looked at the people around him celebrating together. He stood excitedly on the roof of the car, savoring the victory that belonged to him at this moment.
0:5:20|0:5:28|After the hustle and bustle, [Xu Tailang] walked towards his father on the terrace, who was about to light a cigarette but stopped the motion.
0:5:29|0:5:37|Father then noticed a streamer hanging on his shoulder, he took it off and stuffed it into his pocket.
0:6:7|0:6:32|Father paused, took the cigarette out of his mouth. [Xu Tailang] started the race car and drove out of the parking lot. In the middle of the road, Father twisted his mouth, watching the racing car speeding towards him, he remained motionless, until the car made a sudden brake in front of him, he couldn't help but stagger.
0:6:32|0:6:36|[Xu Tailang] knocked on the car window and made a gesture to signal his father to get in.
0:6:37|0:6:44|The racing car speeds along a gravel road, with [Xu Zhengtai] wearing a helmet inside, looking very nervous.
0:6:46|0:7:1|[Xu Tailang] sneered at his nervous father, ignoring his pleas. He drifted around a sharp turn, kicking up a cloud of dust as the vehicle continued down a rural path. The mud and water did not slow down [Xu Tailang] at all, while [Xu Zhengtai] kept his eyes closed, feeling uncomfortable.
0:7:5|0:7:23|[Xu Tailang] fiercely turned the steering wheel, and the racing car made another sharp turn. With a half-smile on his face, [Xu Tailang] looked at his father in pain. He skillfully operated every button, and the speed of the car kept increasing. The racing car flew towards the center of the tracks, just as a speeding train was approaching head-on. Everything went black before [Xu Tailang]'s eyes.
0:7:24|0:7:33|When [Xu Tailang] opened his eyes, he saw a doctor continuously patting himself, and it seemed like he was saying something.
0:7:44|0:7:49|At this moment, every detail of Xu Tailang's life flashes through his mind.
0:7:49|0:8:12|At the age of two, Xu Tailang first met his father in the prison visiting room. His father tried to reach the milk bottle through the barrier to feed his son. When the visiting time was up, his father left. At the age of five, at home, his father kicked over the neatly stacked building blocks made by Tailang, looking at Xu Tailang with a face full of disappointment, saying, "Playing with these every day, what future can you have?" After saying that, he staggered out.
0:8:12|0:8:27|At the age of 10, the teacher questioned the father, "Did you sign the paper?" The father mercilessly kicked Xu Tailang, then kicked him again while watching a car race, saying, "What are you, a child, watching a car race."
0:8:27|0:8:45|[Xu Tailang] picked up a photo frame, the woman's face on it was blurry. He held the album and called out "Mom". At the age of 18 at the skating rink, a girl skated towards [Xu Tailang], he smiled and said, "Ah Lang, I love you." Soon, the girl sat in the back seat of someone else's car and apologized to [Xu Tailang], saying, "I'm sorry, I've fallen in love with someone else."
0:8:45|0:9:0|Watching the silhouette of the motorcycle fading away, [Xu Tailang] threw the rose in his hand onto the road. Injured, [Xu Tailang] arrived at a hair salon filled with a sensual atmosphere. After a passionate encounter, the proprietress sat by the bed and gently asked [Xu Tailang], "How do you feel?"
0:9:0|0:9:22|At the age of 23 at the racing scene, [Xu Tailang] hung up the gear and told the coach that he felt nervous for the first time. The coach gestured outside the car to countdown. However, after the start, [Xu Tailang] drove the car into a ditch. The navigator angrily threw a glove and said, "Are you stupid? How can you drive into a ditch on a straight line? I will never be your navigator again." The sponsor pointed at [Xu Tailang]'s nose and said, "You will never have another chance."
0:9:22|0:9:28|The person in charge of the repair shop only gave him one word: leave.
0:9:31|0:9:50|Father opened the car door for [Xu Tailang] to get in. Then the ambulance overturned. [Xu Tailang] called 120, "Hello, this is the ambulance. We need an ambulance." Father stood outside the clinic, hands on hips in anger. He couldn't help but step forward and slap [Xu Tailang]. Only the boss lady from the hair salon comforted him, saying, "Don't be sad."
0:9:50|0:10:9|Late at night, [Xu Tailang] was waving a bottle on the rooftop and slipped and fell. The next day, [Xu Tailang] lay on a hospital bed, with the owner of a hair salon sitting on a chair beside him. He was eating a banana and said, "Drink less and go drive for my big brother." That day, his big brother rushed to the car panting and instructed [Xu Tailang].
0:10:9|0:10:24|Behind the eldest brother, a group of people carrying sticks closely followed, while [Xu Tailang] skillfully reversed the car, never being caught by them. Seeing that the group of people could no longer catch up with the car, the eldest brother in the back seat looked pleased and said, "You drove well."
0:10:24|0:10:42|The eldest brother pointed proudly at a white sports car behind him, while [Xu Tailang] was doing sit-ups on the bed, with posters of beautiful women and race cars flashing before his eyes. [Xu Tailang] then appeared again at the race track to participate in the competition. During the race, the navigator encouraged him to stay steady until he reached the finish line.
0:10:43|0:10:52|[Xu Tailang], who crossed the finish line, was surrounded by the crowd. Amidst the flashlights and flower garlands, [Xu Tailang] received the first championship trophy. He kissed the trophy deeply.
0:10:53|0:11:6|He then placed the trophy in front of his mother's grave [Zhang Suzhen], sharing the joy of his championship. Returning to the scene of the accident once again, the racing car soared into the air, about to fly over the railroad tracks, the scene slowed down countless times.
0:11:6|0:11:29|When Xu Tailang's racing car flew into the center of the railway track, he turned his head and watched the approaching train step by step, while his father sitting in the passenger seat also stared in shock. With a strong impact, the racing car spun two circles in the air.
0:11:29|0:11:34|As the car flipped over and crashed heavily onto the side of the road, it rolled over several times.
0:11:39|0:12:1|The unbearable weight caused the car window to shatter, scattering around the car body. Father and son inside the car tightly closed their eyes, secured by the seat belts, as the car kept flipping. The huge impact prevented them from making any protective moves. The champagne inside the car was also shattered by the collision. The trophy fell down as well.
0:12:2|0:12:22|A fragment grazed the cheek of [Xu Tailang], leaving a long bloodstain. The car was thrown tens of meters away by the impact before crashing heavily into a wall and finally coming to a stop. Despite the car's mangled appearance, the high-strength anti-collision beams inside the professional racing car kept the cockpit relatively intact.
0:12:22|0:12:38|The two unconscious people in the car were rescued in time. [Xu Tailang], wearing a heart-saving mask, opened his eyes in confusion, having recalled his entire life. Through [Xu Tailang]'s eyes, he seemed to see the blue sky and white clouds.
0:12:38|0:12:57|In his eyes, it seemed as if he was slowly rising into the air, passing through the thin mist and entering the thick clouds. The white clouds constantly changed colors under the sunlight, and as he navigated through the dense clouds, the words "riding the wind and breaking the waves" slowly appeared on the screen.
0:12:57|0:13:18|[Xu Tailang] pushed open a wooden door and walked out, looking around curiously. The streets here were filled with the quaintness of the 90s, and even though it was night, the huge neon signs of the beloved KTV illuminated the whole street brightly. [Xu Tailang] was a bit puzzled, looking around at the passersby and the street.
0:13:18|0:13:32|He looked very unfamiliar and full of doubts at all this seemingly familiar. [Xu Tailang] suddenly saw a familiar figure. At this moment, a middle-aged woman in simple clothes with a long ponytail looked at him.
0:13:53|0:14:6|At this moment, hearing someone shouting, [Xu Tailang] didn't hesitate to chase after, closely following the thief without letting go. The thief agilely turned through one alley after another, but still couldn't shake off [Xu Tailang].
0:14:6|0:14:20|Watching as [Xu Tailang] was about to catch up to the thief, the thief suddenly stopped and turned around, pulling out a dagger from his leg. The previously aggressive [Xu Tailang] immediately backed off, turned around, and started walking back. After a few steps, he suddenly muttered to himself.
0:14:21|0:14:39|[Xu Tailang] turned around and faced the thief charging at him with a knife, remaining calm. Suddenly, a motorcycle rushed straight between the two, and a masked man in a black cloak descended from above, with two swords inserted behind his back.
0:14:40|0:14:48|The masked man casually threw the cloak aside while staring warily at the thief, and at the same time, pulled out another dagger and pointed it at [Xu Tailang].
0:14:49|0:14:56|The three individuals stared at each other for a long time, and the masked man slowly drew two one-meter-long swords from behind him, pointing them at the thief.
0:14:59|0:15:2|The thief looked at the small dagger in his hand and said.
0:15:4|0:15:25|After saying that, the thief threw away the dagger in his hand. The masked man also threw his long sword on the ground. Seizing the opportunity, the thief quickly picked up both swords. With a swing of one sword, [Xu Tailang] hurriedly grabbed the thief from behind. The masked man quickly kicked the thief down. The thief struggled to escape, but was held by [Xu Tailang], who dragged him to the ground by his leg. He kicked [Xu Tailang] away, only to be knocked down again by the masked man.
0:15:35|0:15:46|After tying up the thief, the masked man stood up. He took off his helmet, pulled down his mask, revealing his true face. Xu Tailang was stunned, staring in disbelief at the masked man, and shouted in surprise.
0:15:49|0:15:54|The masked man said in confusion, "The two of them lost their belts, and their pants fell to the ground, when the police arrived."
0:16:3|0:16:12|[Xu Zhengtai] picked up the long sword on the ground and walked forward without looking back. Later, [Xu Tailang] was taken back to the police station by the police.
0:16:37|0:16:43|[Xu Tailang] looked at the 1998 calendar on the table, while the two police officers stared at him expressionlessly.
0:17:14|0:17:19|[Xiao Hua] sighed and drew the final stroke of the character "æ­£" on top of [Xu Zhengtai]'s head.
0:17:20|0:17:37|With a serious expression on his face, [Liu Yi] was playing cards and laughing, when suddenly he seemed to see something, he put down his pager and jumped into the river next to him. [Xiao Hua] and [Xu Zhengtai] looked at [Liu Yi] in the river with puzzled expressions.
0:18:9|0:18:15|[Xu Zhengtai] saw [Xu Tailang] next to Director Jin, and Director Jin asked again.
0:18:17|0:18:25|[Xu Zhengtai] looked bewildered, while [Xu Tailang] quickly gave him a signal with his eyes. The two of them simultaneously said, and Director Jin rolled his eyes at them.
0:18:56|0:19:4|[Xu Tailang] quickly came up with a clever idea and said.
0:19:36|0:19:42|Director Jin and police officer Xiao Sun immediately went upstairs to check.
0:19:55|0:20:7|[Xu Tailang] was stunned, thinking hard. Director Jin shouted towards Sun upstairs.
0:20:15|0:20:24|Xu Tailang put away his smile, and then Jin Suozhang left. After confirming that the police had left, [Xu Zhengtai] turned around and looked at [Xu Tailang].
0:20:26|0:20:42|[Xu Zhengtai] picked up the walkie-talkie on the table and walked towards the second-floor terrace, with [Xu Tailang] following closely behind, looking around joyfully at everything, full of curiosity about every plant and flower. [Xu Zhengtai] looked puzzled at the curious [Xu Tailang] beside the terrace and asked seriously.
0:20:45|0:21:1|[Xu Tailang] was somewhat speechless, he glanced into the distance and, unable to explain, obediently said.
0:21:7|0:21:30|[Xu Tailang] looked at the smiling [Xu Zhengtai] with a hint of helplessness, then turned around and sighed towards the distance. [Xu Tailang] suddenly realized and muttered to himself.
0:22:7|0:22:14|[Xu Tailang] agreed without hesitation.
0:22:55|0:23:1|Zhengtai grabbed Liu Yi.
0:23:3|0:23:15|Soon, the exhausted group of four arrived at the riverside, shouting weakly. Upon hearing a dog barking, [Xu Zhengtai] immediately made a gesture to stop and identified the direction to chase after, with the other three following closely behind.
0:23:16|0:23:23|Four people struggled to climb onto the roof, hiding under the eaves and looking down. [Liu Yi] looked at the puppy tied to the car and said.
0:23:50|0:23:55|Seeing [Luo Li] walking towards them, the four of them instinctively ducked their heads back in unison.
0:24:0|0:24:18|[Xiao Hua] left, leaving the remaining three to discuss. Later, they arrived at [Xu Zhengtai]'s house, where [Xiao Hua] was cooking in the kitchen.
0:24:19|0:24:26|[Xu Tailang] looked at the kitchen with anticipation on his face. [Xiao Hua] turned around and walked back.
0:24:33|0:24:39|The elder sister-in-law [Xiao Hua] lifted the door curtain and came out with a fish. [Xiao Hua] had a good complexion and a very delicate appearance.
0:26:27|0:26:36|[Xu Tailang] turned his head with a smile.
0:26:40|0:26:48|[Xiao Hua] continued to look towards the kitchen, while [Xu Tailang] calmly served [Xiao Hua] some dishes.
0:27:4|0:27:10|[Xu Tailang] smiled contentedly, then turned to [Xu Zhengtai] in the kitchen.
0:27:13|0:27:31|[Xu Tailang] waved goodbye to [Xiao Hua] and headed home. On a rainy night, [Luo Li]'s car swayed on the side of the road, and another car crashed into it, the huge impact interrupting the intimacy between [Luo Li] and his wife. He looked impatiently out the window.
0:27:32|0:27:40|Luo Li angrily got out of the car and cursed, feeling guilty when he saw the culprit.
0:28:2|0:28:10|Luo Li turned around and saw the high heels in front of the glass window. He took off the high heels and carefully put them on his wife's feet.
0:28:16|0:28:31|On the other side, [Xu Tailang] stood straight in a white floral shirt at the bridge, with a rose in his mouth. As he slowly turned around, he saw not only [Xiao Hua] but also [Xu Zhengtai] and [Liu Yi] approaching. Witnessing this scene, the rose in his mouth withered.
0:28:31|0:28:48|[Xu Tailang] sat at the front of the motorcycle with a look of despair, while [Xu Zhengtai] confidently rode the motorcycle with a flower in his mouth. [Xiao Hua] hugged [Xu Zhengtai]'s waist, looking very happy. Following closely behind them was [Liu Yi] on another motorcycle. [Liu Yi] focused on the road ahead, with his goddess Jia Yi sitting behind him.
0:28:48|0:29:6|Jiayi enjoys the feeling of riding a motorcycle. [Liu Yi] couldn't help but smile as he took his goddess for a ride. The group soon arrived at the entrance of the cinema, locked the bike, and watched a tense and exciting Hong Kong movie at the cinema.
0:29:12|0:29:21|[Xiao Hua] brought back several bags of snacks to share with everyone.
0:29:50|0:29:57|[Liu Yi] sneaked out of the theater and picked a rose from a rose bed.
0:30:15|0:30:24|Liu Yi, who was still unaware of the situation, ran over and asked, only to discover that the rose petals had already been squeezed off.
0:30:26|0:30:32|Jia Yi looked at the infatuated [Liu Yi] and refused. Jia Yi glanced at her watch.
0:30:49|0:31:0|[Xu Tailang] waved his hand and pulled [Liu Yi] over, looking at the dejected [Liu Yi] and comforting him. [Xu Zhengtai] sat on the back of the chair and said.
0:31:12|0:31:28|[Xu Zhengtai] took out a ring and handed it to [Xiao Hua]. [Xiao Hua] smiled and took the ring. She put the ring on her ring finger.
0:31:29|0:31:36|[Xu Zhengtai] joyfully embraces [Xiao Hua], while [Xu Tailang] pounds on the chair beside them, looking somewhat frustrated.
0:31:37|0:31:52|Early in the morning, [Xu Zhengtai], [Xu Tailang], and [Liu Yi] sat at a noodle stall. The noodle master spat into his hands and vigorously kneaded the dough.
0:32:39|0:32:47|[Xu Zhengtai] quickly picked up the noodles that the master had placed on the book.
0:33:12|0:33:26|At night, the three of them arrived at the Beloved Song and Dance Hall, with [Xu Tailang] following [Xu Zhengtai] and [Liu Yi] inside.
0:34:47|0:34:54|Jiayi looked puzzled, but still followed her sisters out. [Xu Tailang] talked about negotiation skills.
0:35:30|0:35:43|Xu Tailang pointed at Xu Zhengtai's crossed hands, while Xu Tailang also crossed his hands. They gestured opening and closing their fingers a few times, and the three of them synchronously performed the same opening and closing movements. Then, they intuitively intertwined their fingers with each other.
0:35:44|0:35:50|At this moment, [Luo Li] burst in with three henchmen, one of whom harassed Jia Yi outside the door.
0:36:1|0:36:20|[Luo Li] sneered disdainfully. After hearing this, [Liu Yi] strode aggressively to [Luo Li]'s front, muttering something under his breath. Not hearing anything from [Liu Yi], [Luo Li] impatiently slapped him across the face.
0:36:22|0:36:32|[Luo Li] pulled out a gun to signal the two to sit back, then [Luo Li] sat on the sofa on the other side.
0:37:8|0:37:16|Xu Tailang sat down next to [Luo Li] upon seeing the situation.
0:37:35|0:37:45|After speaking, [Luo Li] stood up with a sneer and walked away under the gaze of Xu Zhengtai's group.
0:37:47|0:38:8|[Xu Zhengtai] smashed the glasses on the table with one kick, [Xu Tailang] followed up without hesitation with another kick, and [Liu Yi] also stepped on them without hesitation. On the other side, [Luo Li] pulled the eye mask over Xiaoma's eyes.
0:38:12|0:38:27|Xiao Ma was tied to a chair and unable to move. [Luo Li] squatted in front of him, feeding him spoonful by spoonful. [Luo Li]'s henchmen watched in disbelief, forgetting to eat their own food.
0:38:30|0:38:40|[Luo Li] and Xiao Hua locked eyes, placed the food tray on Xiao Hua's legs, [Luo Li] walked to his subordinate and analyzed, then he glanced at Xiao Hua again.
0:39:14|0:39:30|Seeing Xiao Ma's reaction, [Luo Li] realized and covered his face, saying. [Luo Li] looked regretful as he stared at his henchman who had just suggested tearing the ticket, and pulled out a gun.
0:39:33|0:39:51|The henchmen cowered in the corner, scared. After scaring his henchmen, [Luo Li] calmed down a bit, furrowing his brow and scratching his head as he slammed the gun on the table. Suddenly, the gun went off, startling everyone.
0:39:51|0:40:6|[Luo Li] looked around in a panic, then pretended to calm down and straightened his clothes. Meanwhile, his subordinate pointed the muzzle of the gun on the table towards [Luo Li].
0:40:53|0:41:8|[Luo Li] looked thoughtfully at his subordinate, while on the other side, [Xu Zhengtai] led [Xu Tailang] and [Liu Yi] into his recording studio. [Xu Tailang] looked around curiously.
0:41:22|0:41:28|He then took Xu Zhengtai's sunglasses and put them on, with Xu Tailang following Xu Zhengtai out of the recording studio.
0:42:28|0:42:33|[Xu Zhengtai] and [Liu Yi] quickly ran towards the restroom, while [Xu Tailang] lazily followed behind, leaning against the wall.
0:42:44|0:43:13|Xu Tailang's sack on his head was taken off, and he found himself in a car. Gritting his teeth, Xu Tailang shook off his sunglasses. He calmly observed the situation around him, then suddenly stretched his foot to hook the handbrake. The car made a sharp turn without warning, and [Xu Tailang] took the opportunity to punch the kidnapper next to him, then opened the door and kicked him out. [Xu Tailang] stepped on the driver's right leg, causing the car to start swerving wildly.
0:43:17|0:43:28|[Xu Tailang] stepped on the driver's hand on the steering wheel with another foot, and used his foot to turn the steering wheel. Then [Xu Tailang] lunged forward to give the driver an elbow strike, and threw him out of the car. [Xu Tailang] quickly climbed into the driver's seat and took control of the car.
0:43:28|0:43:36|[Xu Zhengtai] revved the motorcycle engine forcefully, and [Xu Tailang] brought the bike to a stop in front of him.
0:43:46|0:43:56|Two people drove away in a car, at this moment Jin and Xiaosun walked out of a warehouse. They were about to ride a motorcycle when they were splashed all over by the car driven by [Xu Zhengtai].
0:43:57|0:44:1|Director Jin hurriedly sat on the sidecar motorcycle.
0:44:5|0:44:14|At this moment, [Luo Li] is on a date with his wife Matsuko. It is very quiet here, with a scenic picture of Mount Fuji in the background, and a table full of delicious Japanese cuisine.
0:44:53|0:44:56|Matsuko looked affectionately at [Luo Li] and raised her glass.
0:44:58|0:45:19|After speaking, she took the initiative to touch [Luo Li]'s wine glass and drank it all in one gulp. Feeling embarrassed, [Luo Li] lowered his head and also finished his drink in one go. After putting down the glass, he said to his wife.
0:46:14|0:46:22|[Xu Tailang] was outnumbered and knocked down to the ground. Just as [Xu Zhengtai] stood up, he was pushed onto the sofa by his henchman, and the two started grappling with each other. [Xu Zhengtai] quickly dealt with the lackey beneath him with a punch, when suddenly another henchman swung a metal rod towards him.
0:46:40|0:46:57|Blindfolded and tied to a chair, Xiao Ma helplessly listened to the intense fighting around him. Before long, Luo Li's men were knocked down by the combined efforts of two people. Seizing the opportunity while they were still groaning in pain, Xu Tailang, without hesitation, rushed to Xiao Ma's side.
0:46:57|0:47:6|He shouted and called for [Xu Zhengtai], and the two of them carried Xiao Ma and the chair out, until then [Luo Li] in the nearby warehouse received the message.
0:47:7|0:47:16|The frightened Xiao Hua was tied up and sitting in the trunk. The two men rushed out without even closing the trunk door, while Director Jin and Xiao Sun were still squatting outside the warehouse door.
0:47:17|0:47:24|[Xu Zhengtai] drove out of the gate in a swift manner, leaving Director Jin shocked. He quickly asked Xiaosun to chase after.
0:47:24|0:47:44|Xiao Sun stepped on the gas pedal with all his might, but the motorcycle still wouldn't start. Just then, [Luo Li] angrily ran out of the gate with a gun in hand, while Xiao Sun quickly crouched behind the motorcycle. Seeing the police standing awkwardly in place, [Luo Li] turned back and [Xu Zhengtai] was celebrating in front of the hotpot that evening.
0:49:31|0:49:38|[Xu Tailang] stood up, feeling a bit at a loss for words.
0:50:47|0:50:57|[Liu Yi] pointed at [Xu Zhengtai] as if remembering something, then quickly ran to the second-floor terrace. Once on the terrace, [Liu Yi] leaned forward with hands on knees and shouted loudly towards the distance.
0:51:18|0:51:21|[Xu Tailang] encouragedly patted Xiao Ma's shoulder, and Xiao Ma seemed lost in thought.
0:51:21|0:51:35|On the terrace, [Xu Zhengtai] handed a cigarette to [Liu Yi], comforting him by patting his head. [Liu Yi] took a deep drag, then choked and leaned against [Xu Zhengtai] beside him. In the early morning, four people were sprawled on the terrace in a tangled mess.
0:51:37|0:51:45|The next day, Xu Tailang went to Xiao Hua's house. Xiao Hua was sitting on the bed watching TV with her head in her hands when Tailang opened the door and walked in.
0:51:49|0:51:58|[Xu Tailang] answered with a sound, then he squatted down next to the TV and tried to press the switch, but the TV turned on just fine.
0:51:59|0:52:7|[Xu Tailang] couldn't help but glance at [Xiao Hua], trying to figure out what she meant. [Xu Tailang] squatted on the ground, stood up slowly, lost in thought.
0:52:8|0:52:13|After getting up, Xu Tailang looked around uncomfortably, and finally sat awkwardly on the TV cabinet, trying to maintain a deliberate distance.
0:52:33|0:52:40|[Xu Tailang] stood with his hands on his hips, looking at [Xiao Hua] on the bed, and then walked slowly towards her while muttering to himself.
0:52:53|0:53:8|[Xu Tailang] sat on the edge of the bed and awkwardly touched his neck, while [Xiao Hua] opened the window. A gentle breeze brushed through her hair, causing the side strands to sway in the wind. The sunlight lightly sprinkled on [Xiao Hua]'s face, making her look particularly charming. She turned around and slowly sat down next to [Xu Tailang].
0:53:10|0:53:24|[Xu Tailang] leaned back slightly, supporting his body with both hands, looking at [Xiao Hua] with a half-smile. [Xiao Hua] took off her hair tie, letting her hair gently brush against [Xu Tailang]'s face. Feeling teased, [Xu Tailang] gazed affectionately at the nearby [Xiao Hua], who whispered softly.
0:53:27|0:53:36|[Xu Tailang] stiffly turned his body to find the remote control. He gently brushed over [Xiao Hua]'s translucent coat with the hand holding the remote control, switching TV channels.
0:53:40|0:53:53|With one hand already placed on Xu Tailang's thigh, Xiao Hua looked deeply into Xu Tailang's eyes. The remote control in his hand slipped involuntarily as he gently placed Xiao Hua's head on the bed.
0:53:57|0:54:2|[Xiao Hua] calmly closed her eyes as [Xu Tailang]'s hand gently brushed the hair beside her cheek.
0:54:6|0:54:13|[Xu Tailang] kept playing with the hair beside [Xiao Hua]'s cheek repeatedly.
0:54:26|0:54:44|He listened to Xiao Hua while taking off his own shirt, and Xiao Hua continued to speak with her eyes closed. Xu Tailang closed his eyes and kissed her slowly.
0:54:49|0:55:3|In the next second, just as he was about to kiss [Xiao Hua], [Xu Tailang] abruptly stopped his movement. He twisted to support himself, stunned for several seconds before coming to his senses. He quickly got up and retreated to lean against the window.
0:56:7|0:56:17|[Xu Zhengtai] walked over and patted his shoulder, then [Xu Tailang] hesitated and said.
0:56:31|0:56:49|On the other side, the cabinet suddenly opened, [Liu Yi] climbed out with a gloomy face. He looked around in despair, his gaze finally resting on [Xu Zhengtai]'s face. Wiping away tears, he slammed the door and stormed out.
0:56:50|0:56:56|[Xu Zhengtai] chased out and found [Liu Yi] on a rooftop.
0:57:15|0:57:23|Zhengtai stood with his hands on his hips, looking at Liu Yi with his head down, and said somewhat helplessly.
0:57:25|0:57:31|Zhengtai looked at [Liu Yi], touched the back of his neck, and said thoughtfully.
0:57:38|0:57:45|Xu Zhengtai scratched his head for a long time after listening, frowned helplessly, turned away to deal with him. Liu Yi then turned to Xu Tailang.
0:57:49|0:57:55|[Xu Tailang] looked coldly into the distance without saying a word.
0:58:0|0:58:11|Fireworks suddenly burst not far away, and three people watched quietly. [Xu Tailang]'s expression also became slightly happier. At this moment, [Liu Yi] looked at the two silent individuals and said to [Xu Zhengtai].
0:58:27|0:58:38|[Xu Tailang] looked into the distance as [Xu Zhengtai] walked over. Watching the fireworks, he asked without knowing the reason.
0:59:24|0:59:41|[Xu Tailang] turned around and looked at [Xu Zhengtai] for a long time. Then [Xu Tailang] rushed into [Xiao Hua]'s house, but did not find her. Looking at the empty house, [Xu Tailang] seemed a bit at a loss. He then ran along the riverside path, passing through one small alley after another.
0:59:41|0:59:50|Xu Tailang looked around everywhere for the figure of Xiao Hua. He almost ran through every building and every corner of the town, not even the most remote place was left out.
0:59:52|1:0:12|The sun gradually moved towards the west, casting its light on the water surface. A gentle breeze rustled the tree branches, creating a peaceful atmosphere in the small town. [Xu Tailang] stood in the middle of the bridge, feeling disheartened as he had gained nothing, looking around unwillingly. As the sky darkened, [Xu Zhengtai] remained on the rooftop, pacing back and forth with one hand in his pocket.
1:0:12|1:0:24|He took a deep drag on his cigarette, looking into the distance, faithfully waiting for [Xu Tailang]. [Xu Tailang] sat on the bus, leaning against the window, unconsciously falling asleep, with a visible weariness and sense of loss on his face.
1:0:24|1:0:42|It's late at night, [Xu Zhengtai] blending into the darkness, still standing on the rooftop. The small town is quiet in the deep night, [Xu Tailang] sits wearily and helplessly by the wooden wall, watching the passersby. The exhaustion of the day has drained him of all strength, and he buries his head deeply into his knees.
1:0:42|1:0:50|The next morning, [Xiao Hua] woke up [Xu Tailang] who was sleeping on the side of the road.
1:1:50|1:2:0|[Xu Tailang] reminisced about his childhood experiences while [Xiao Hua] nodded gently, showing that she could relate.
1:2:13|1:2:32|[Xiao Hua] looked up at the sky, and [Xu Tailang] followed her gaze. After a moment of anticipation, [Xu Tailang] spoke.
1:2:40|1:2:49|She comfortingly patted Xu Tailang's cheek, as Xu Tailang stared intently at Xiao Hua.
1:2:57|1:3:5|[Xu Zhengtai] took a sip from the bottle of wine, walked shoulder to shoulder with [Xu Tailang] to the riverside. Without responding, [Xu Tailang] spoke with a serious expression on his face.
1:3:56|1:4:5|[Xu Tailang] took the bottle of wine and took a sip while looking into the distance.
1:4:12|1:4:33|In the distance, a black smoke rose, and the fireboat was on its way. Xu Zhengtai ran ahead, leaving Xu Tailang and the fireboat far behind. The two of them ran to Xu Zhengtai's house, where they stopped and looked inside, only to see the raging flames lighting up the entire house.
1:4:33|1:4:41|[Xu Zhengtai] rushed in without hesitation, [Xu Tailang] hesitated for a moment, then quickly followed. [Xu Zhengtai] pulled open the security door, kicked open the wooden door inside fiercely, and squeezed into the raging fire.
1:4:42|1:4:56|[Xu Tailang] awkwardly covered his mouth and nose, used his clothes to shield his head, and rushed in. The raging flames filled the entire room, and thick smoke could be seen even in the farthest part of the small town. Two figures in black clothes, holding black umbrellas, watched the thick smoke in the distance and then turned and walked away.
1:4:57|1:5:5|[Xu Zhengtai] and [Xu Tailang] are leaning against the bridge with a portrait and an urn in their arms, their faces covered in soot.
1:5:41|1:5:52|[Xu Zhengtai] turned the frame in his hand to the back, opened the back panel, and inside were neatly arranged banknotes of different denominations.
1:6:11|1:6:19|[Xu Zhengtai] [Xu Tailang] and [Liu Yi] walked to a small alley, and when [Xu Tailang] noticed that there was no one around, he stopped and said to the other two.
1:6:27|1:6:35|[Xu Tailang] resisted the urge to roll his eyes and pulled out a chopstick from the nearby window.
1:6:37|1:6:45|[Xu Tailang] exerted force to break the chopsticks, but they didn't budge until he used all his strength. [Xu Tailang] held up the chopsticks that had been broken into two pieces.
1:6:46|1:6:52|[Xu Tailang] pulled out three chopsticks from the window again.
1:6:54|1:7:6|[Liu Yi] took the chopsticks in confusion and gently broke them. [Liu Yi] looked at [Xu Zhengtai], then at [Xu Tailang]. [Xu Tailang] embraced the two of them.
1:7:22|1:7:29|The man in front of them turned his back and lit a cigarette.
1:7:40|1:7:43|The man stood with one hand in his pocket, flicking the cigarette butt onto the ground.
1:8:58|1:9:4|The man lifted his head and slowly turned around, [Xu Tailang] couldn't help but move forward and stared at the man.
1:9:40|1:9:53|The thug swung the stick fiercely towards Xu Zhengtai's leg, causing his face to contort in pain, unable to speak. Xu Tailang lay on the ground unconscious.
1:10:13|1:10:21|[Xu Tailang] couldn't help but stand up, and somewhat dazedly pulled over [Xiao Hua], who was standing next to him with a hint of annoyance.
1:11:44|1:11:52|At this moment, [Xiao Hua] was already looking out the window on the train.
1:14:12|1:14:18|The couple ignored the argument between [Xu Tailang] and the photographer, and intimately kissed each other. Xiao Ma sat on the train.
1:14:23|1:14:28|The train shuttles through a dense forest towards the distance.
1:14:31|1:14:50|Today is the wedding day of [Xu Zhengtai], and the wedding ceremony is held at the beloved KTV, with a very romantic decoration. The venue is full of guests, very lively, even those without seats are standing and eating without complaint. Occasionally, there are girls accompanying the guests, but the couple is discussing in the corridor.
1:15:6|1:15:17|Zhengtai furrowed his brows, while [Xu Tailang] anxiously scanned the crowd still eating.
1:15:24|1:15:40|At this moment, [Liu Yi] still at home, wearing a white tank top, decisively put on the suspenders that [Xu Zhengtai] wore when he caught the thief. After adjusting the tightness, he even inserted two long swords into them. [Liu Yi] rarely had such a serious expression, and he walked out with a resolute stride.
1:15:40|1:15:51|Carrying a bundle of rope in his hand, wearing a white tank top that revealed the tattoos on his arms, and empowered by the twin swords, [Liu Yi] strode aggressively down the hallway filled with elderly people.
1:15:51|1:16:9|He stood on a rooftop, looking expressionless towards the distance. He secured one end of a rope, and threw the other end off the rooftop. After putting on gloves, he stood at the edge of the rooftop, holding onto the rope and looking down. The towering building made [Liu Yi], who exuded a strong aura, involuntarily gasp for breath, then he leaped down.
1:17:57|1:18:2|Huang Zhiqiang is discussing work with the lawyer in the office, while [Liu Yi] is hanging in mid-air, desperately hitting the office window.
1:18:4|1:18:12|The bodyguard immediately put down the newspaper and brought [Liu Yi] to Huang Zhiqiang.
1:18:49|1:18:55|After saying that, [Liu Yi] prepared to draw his sword and make a big move, but it took him a long time to pull out the sword.
1:19:2|1:19:14|Huang Zhiqiang swiftly pulled out an umbrella as Liu Yi rushed over. Xiao Hua and Xu Zhengtai stood hand in hand in front of the stage, while Xu Tailang danced joyfully on the side.
1:19:40|1:19:46|On the other side, [Liu Yi] glared with a ferocious expression as Huang Zhiqiang's umbrella plunged straight into his heart.
1:19:48|1:19:53|[Liu Yi] still stubbornly raised his head and said.
1:20:25|1:20:32|The body of [Liu Yi] lay on the ground, surrounded by bodyguards who seemed accustomed to such scenes.
1:20:34|1:20:42|[Xu Zhengtai] excitedly danced on stage, giving a big hug to [Xu Tailang], who then tightly embraced the couple.
1:20:42|1:21:0|[Xu Tailang] held onto [Xiao Hua] unwilling to let go, [Xiao Hua] and [Xu Zhengtai] lovingly patted [Xu Tailang] on the back. The scene then cut back to the office. [Liu Yi]'s body lay on the cold floor with eyes wide open. The body was then taken to the morgue.
1:21:1|1:21:6|[Jia Yi] wore a black dress and went to the morgue to see [Liu Yi] for the last time.
1:21:6|1:21:38|In the pouring rain, the golden retriever Mumu sat at the entrance of the morgue unwilling to leave for a long time. It seemed to see the confident Liu Yi under the street lamp, the admiring Liu Yi watching Chow Yun-fat in the movie, the bragging Liu Yi at the dining table, the cautious Liu Yi touching Xu Zhengtai's motorcycle, and the Liu Yi who rode the motorcycle into the cinema with a twist of the throttle.
1:21:41|1:22:0|The one who trains hard by punching sandbags upside down, in order to fight alongside [Xu Zhengtai] against the world with [Liu Yi]. The one who is chased and runs to find his big brother, the miraculous [Liu Yi], happily riding a motorcycle to take [Jiayi] for a ride.
1:22:4|1:22:29|[In the scene, Liu Yi, who was demonstrating the secret code with his brothers, froze in that moment. Back in reality, Xu Zhengtai and Xu Tailang arrived at the morgue, with Xu Zhengtai squatting on the ground crying loudly. That night, Xu Zhengtai squatted at the door and burned paper money for Liu Yi.]
1:22:30|1:22:47|He took the cigarette behind his ear, looked at it, and gently threw it into the fire. [Xu Zhengtai] stood up, exchanged a glance with [Xu Tailang] beside him, and the two of them confidently left. The next day, the two of them, with unspoken understanding and full of anger, arrived at the office.
1:22:47|1:23:8|Huang Zhiqiang's office is in a mess, already deserted. [Xu Zhengtai] and [Xu Tailang] barge into the office, but find nothing but scattered blueprints on the floor. They run outside, where two cars belonging to Huang Zhiqiang are sealed off at the entrance. [Xu Zhengtai] casually opens the door of one of the cars.
1:23:20|1:23:31|[Xu Tailang] smiled without saying a word, and opened the car door. The two of them searched around in the car, but couldn't find any trace of the keys.
1:23:32|1:23:35|Suddenly, a hand holding a key reached out from the window.
1:23:36|1:23:43|[Xu Tailang] looked at [Luo Li] in confusion, then glanced at [Xu Zhengtai]. Seeing that [Luo Li] meant no harm, [Xu Tailang] hesitated for a moment before accepting the key.
1:23:50|1:23:56|[Xu Zhengtai] took the note, silently read the address once, and then glanced at [Luo Li]. He pretended to be calm and said.
1:24:15|1:24:39|[Luo Li] stared blankly as the racing car swiftly drifted through two corners and disappeared from sight. He remained silent. [Xu Zhengtai] was wide-eyed and frightened by Tailang's speed, the inertia of the drift throwing him against the window. Another sharp turn, the wheels scraping against the roadside, sending dust flying in an instant.
1:24:39|1:24:47|The car sped through bridges, riversides, and town streets, maneuvering through the narrow streets of the small town, with all kinds of road conditions calmly handled by [Xu Tailang].
1:24:49|1:24:59|After being directed the wrong way by [Xu Zhengtai], [Xu Tailang] quickly turned the car around. At that moment, a Suzuki Alto came towards them, and [Xu Tailang] actually lifted half of the car sideways, scraping the chassis against the nearby bus as they passed by.
1:25:1|1:25:11|[Xu Tailang] raised the corners of his mouth and continued to drive the car, swiftly shuttling through the streets. In the narrow alley where only one small car could pass through, [Xu Tailang] was actually speeding along.
1:25:11|1:25:21|[Xu Zhengtai] cautiously glanced at [Xu Tailang]'s skillful operation, then quietly looked away. After crossing the last street, the car made a sharp turn and stopped in front of an alley, and the two got out of the car.
1:25:21|1:25:36|At this moment, Huang Zhiqiang casually walked out with two bodyguards, while [Xu Zhengtai] and [Xu Tailang] aggressively blocked the alley. Seeing Huang Zhiqiang, the two rolled up their sleeves and walked into the alley, with the bodyguards following suit.
1:25:37|1:25:46|[Xu Tailang] picked up the washboard next to him, and [Xu Zhengtai] quickly knocked Huang Zhiqiang's bodyguard to the side. Unexpectedly, more thugs appeared in the corridor on the second floor, instantly enveloping the two of them.
1:25:47|1:25:53|[Xu Zhengtai] and [Xu Tailang] charged forward without showing any weakness, the two of them fighting their way from the beginning to the end of the alley as if completing a level in a video game.
1:25:54|1:26:7|[Xu Zhengtai] grabbed a bamboo basket and smashed it forward, while [Xu Tailang] threw over his shoulder and knocked down the four thugs behind him. Tailang picked up a window frame and smashed it on the head of a thug, then turned around and crouched down to face the enemies behind him.
1:26:7|1:26:15|[Xu Zhengtai] blocked the people in front, while [Xu Tailang] stopped the people behind. The two of them, in perfect coordination, were not harmed at all even though there were many enemies.
1:26:15|1:26:30|[Xu Zhengtai] asked [Xu Tailang] to quickly go after Huang Zhiqiang, attempting to stop the group alone. Soon, [Xu Zhengtai] was outnumbered and fell to the ground, being surrounded and beaten by the group. He seized the opportunity to struggle to get up, then hid in a room and tightly blocked the door.
1:26:30|1:26:36|On the other side, [Xu Tailang] shuttles through various alleys, searching for the whereabouts of Huang Zhiqiang.
1:26:40|1:26:50|[Xu Zhengtai] limped up the stairs, only to be kicked down by a foot coming towards him. In the narrow corridor, thugs walked towards [Xu Zhengtai], who quickly dodged backwards.
1:26:50|1:27:5|[Xu Tailang] was surrounded by several thugs, using a plastic basin to resist desperately, but was still kicked hard to the ground. On the other side, things were not going well for [Xu Zhengtai], he was trapped in the kitchen, and the fierce attacks left [Xu Zhengtai] powerless to fight back.
1:27:5|1:27:21|Suddenly, [Xu Zhengtai] grabbed a piece of meat from the ground, found the right moment, and fiercely slapped the thug's face, causing him to stumble and fall to the ground. [Xu Zhengtai] used the meat to tightly strangle the thug's neck, making it difficult for him to breathe. [Xu Tailang] grabbed a wet mop.
1:27:22|1:27:36|Xu Tailang knocked down three people. On the other side, the thug was choked unconscious by [Xu Zhengtai]. An angry [Xu Zhengtai] lifted the unconscious thug and was about to punch him when he stopped. After hesitating for a moment, he got up and ran out to continue searching for Huang Zhiqiang.
1:27:36|1:27:54|The thug who was knocked out slowly got up and chased after [Xu Zhengtai]. [Xu Zhengtai] ran to a corridor, with several thugs in hot pursuit. He agilely flipped over a railing and threw a flower pot at a thug's face. He then kicked another thug away and hurriedly ran through the corridor.
1:27:54|1:28:6|[Xu Tailang] desperately climbed up the stairs, but was tackled from behind and grabbed by the ankle. The two wrestled on the ground, with [Xu Tailang] gaining the upper hand briefly before being kicked off balance by the thug.
1:28:6|1:28:19|[As Xu Tailang, who hadn't stabilized yet, picked up a chair and smashed it over, the thugs also kicked towards Xu Tailang. Xu Tailang unexpectedly flipped over the railing. Xu Tailang hung in mid-air, tightly gripping the railing with both hands. At this moment, Huang Zhiqiang appeared, taking out a beer bottle from the side.]
1:28:19|1:28:36|He walked slowly towards [Xu Tailang], and forcefully smashed his hand towards [Xu Tailang]. Huang Zhiqiang frowned, [Xu Tailang] desperately grabbed onto the railing, his fingers covered in broken glass. As Huang Zhiqiang prepared to stab [Xu Tailang] with the broken bottle neck,
1:28:36|1:28:43|[Xu Zhengtai] arrived just in time and was pierced by wooden spikes. Huang Zhiqiang pulled [Xu Zhengtai] and flipped him off the bridge.
1:28:45|1:29:8|[Xu Tailang]'s hand holding onto the railing couldn't hold on any longer and let go. Fortunately, he and [Xu Zhengtai] landed on the middle platform together, while Huang Zhiqiang fell to the bottom floor, completely lifeless. After a brief rest, the two of them struggled to recover.
1:29:15|1:29:24|Two people covered in blood leaned against the railing.
1:30:18|1:30:36|At this moment, the roar of the plane came from above. [Xiao Hua] looked up and three planes flew past overhead, leaving long trails in the sky. Her eyes instantly welled up with tears, but she held them back and turned to help [Xu Zhengtai] back. A few days later, a black umbrella floated away into the distance along the water.
1:30:48|1:31:8|With Xu Zhengtai sentenced by the court, precious memories of Xu Zhengtai flash on the screen. On the nostalgic rooftop, they rode motorcycles together, went to the cinema, with Xiao Hua and Xu Tailang sleeping beside him, while Xu Zhengtai alone stared intently at the Hong Kong film.
1:31:11|1:31:19|On the bed, the box was opened, filled with pagers belonging to [Xu Zhengtai]. In the video store, they ultimately couldn't keep it open.
1:31:25|1:31:40|Without the cajoling of [Xu Zhengtai], the beloved KTV also had its sign taken down, and the unemployed hostess stood silently at the door. [Xu Tailang] anxiously paced outside the hospital delivery room, hoping to face his younger self, and a few hours later the child was born.
1:31:40|1:31:56|[Xu Tailang] squatted in front of the child, looking at the weak [Xiao Hua]. [Xiao Hua] closed her eyes, with a tear still lingering at the corner of her eye. [Xu Tailang] timidly grabbed the tiny hand flapping in the swaddle. The hospital corridor swiftly tilted backwards, as if a time machine.
1:31:56|1:32:2|Walking through the long corridor, a beam of light at the end was so bright that it made it hard to open one's eyes.
1:32:5|1:32:17|In the next moment, [Xu Tailang] slowly opened his eyes while lying on the hospital bed, then he turned his head towards the other side. His father was sitting on another bed, hunched over, eating a meal, with four playing cards laid out on the table.
1:32:17|1:32:27|Sensing his son's gaze, [Xu Zhengtai] turned to look at him. Seeing his son wake up, [Xu Zhengtai] smiled slightly with relief as he looked at him.
1:32:28|1:32:51|The son lying down with tears in his eyes, looking at his father with white hair beside him, he struggled to open his mouth and weakly let out a sound. Then [Xu Tailang] laboriously raised his hands, his ten fingers weakly interlocked and looked at his father. He gently grasped and then released, repeating it twice. The two of them gazed at each other slowly like this.
1:32:52|1:33:1|[Xu Zhengtai] seemed to be reminded of something by this movement. After a moment of hesitation, he tugged at the corners of his mouth and slowly extended his hands to make the same gesture.
1:33:2|1:33:16|The scene cuts back to Xu Tailang traveling back to 1998, driving through the woods with a young Xu Zhengtai. Impressed by Tailang's driving skills, Xu Zhengtai remarks.
1:33:33|1:33:41|The film is about to say goodbye to you here. Thank you for listening. The final part of the film will bring you a post-credits scene.
1:33:41|1:34:2|Now I will tell you about the post-credits scene. [Xu Tailang] travels back to before the two got married, but with some changes. In the KTV, [Xu Zhengtai] and [Tailang] watch as the hostess sings, with [Tailang] holding the microphone and [Zhengtai] tapping along to the beat.
1:34:7|1:34:17|After singing, [Xu Zhengtai] clapped his hands.
1:34:19|1:34:34|[Xiao Hua] appeared with exquisite makeup and attire, wearing a stylish and understated off-the-shoulder gown. Upon seeing her, the [Misses] all exclaimed together.
1:34:37|1:34:49|The charismatic [Xiao Hua] walked out slowly, approaching a singer beside her and carefully adjusting her collar. Then she walked to the two of them and said to the ladies.
1:35:24|1:35:33|[Xu Tailang] listened, half opening his mouth, silently looking at his own mother [Xiao Hua], and whispered.
1:35:34|1:35:40|After calling out, [Xu Tailang] excitedly hugged [Xiao Hua]'s waist and started crying.
