0:4:44|0:5:2|Watching the massive demonstration procession, the reactionary troops stationed at the Baoshan intersection appeared extremely cold-blooded. At the moment when the crowd broke through the barricades, the officers fired into the air, prompting the reactionary troops crouched behind sandbag bunkers to pull the triggers, and in an instant, countless bullets were unleashed.
0:5:2|0:5:23|The deafening and continuous gunfire echoed throughout the entire city of Shanghai. Within moments, the civilians who couldn't dodge in time fell like grass being cut down. In the darkness, wisps of flames lingered, and a flash of lightning revealed four distinct characters emerging from the depths of the flames: "The Founding of an Army."
0:5:23|0:5:41|The movie officially begins. The scene is set on the eve of the 412 Coup in Shanghai's Jing'an District, where a sedan hurriedly drives towards the Catholic church on Baoshan Road, now serving as the headquarters of the 2nd Division of the 26th Army of the National Revolutionary Army. A middle-aged man in a suit and leather shoes steps out of the sedan.
0:5:41|0:5:48|He is [Zhou Enlai], who was the 29-year-old overall commander of the Shanghai Workers' Armed Uprising at that time.
0:5:54|0:6:12|Outside the headquarters, more than a hundred soldiers with guns were on guard. The officer who responded was named Si Li, the younger brother of the Second Division commander Si Lie. [Zhou Enlai] had served as the director of the political department of the Whampoa Military Academy, where the commander had also studied, hence the respectful address as teacher.
0:6:12|0:6:19|The scene shifts to the Huageluo Mansion, where a young man is welcomed down from a sedan by a guard in a suit.
0:6:24|0:6:33|The young man full of arrogance is none other than [Wang Shouhua], who was then the acting director of the Shanghai General Workers' District. On this day, he was invited by the leader of the Green Gang, [Du Yuesheng], to discuss matters at the Du family mansion.
0:6:33|0:6:52|At the same time, in the Commercial Press located in Zhabei District, workers were busy at work, printing out notices one by one and neatly arranging them. Unbeknownst to the workers who were fully focused on their tasks, danger was silently approaching them at this moment.
0:6:52|0:7:15|In the narrow streets and alleys, a group of 10 men in black gathered and surged into the main street, glaring at the militiamen guarding outside the bookstore. Similar scenes could be seen outside the various worker picket stations in the Shanghai urban area, with numerous trucks patrolling the main roads. The scene then shifts back to inside the Catholic church.
0:7:40|0:7:53|The speaker is [Zhou Enlai], accompanied by the commander of the 2nd Division of the 26th Army, Silei. As Silei shakes his head in denial, the scene shifts to the misty city of Nanjing. Inside a luxurious building, a middle-aged man leans against a table.
0:7:53|0:8:8|Looking out at the flashing lightning outside the window, it was as chaotic as the rain in Nanjing. The once lively Shanghai city now saw a large number of soldiers and police disarming and detaining the workers' picket teams everywhere.
0:8:10|0:8:16|In the mansion, [Du Yuesheng] ignored [Wang Shouhua] and simply peeled the fruit in his hand.
0:8:18|0:8:32|He said slowly. After that, he placed the pear in front of [Wang Shouhua], and saw [Wang Shouhua] handing the pear back.
0:9:22|0:9:45|[Du Yuesheng] finished speaking and picked up the yellow wine to offer it. [Wang Shouhua] still aloof, refused to take it and left him hanging. [Du Yuesheng]'s face turned cold and consistent, he then flipped his hand in front of him with a hint of mercy, the yellow wine in the cup spilled down, and three guards in the room immediately stepped forward, two of them restraining [Wang Shouhua],
0:9:45|0:9:57|He couldn't move. One person grabbed his throat and ruthlessly stabbed a small knife into his neck, blood gushing out at that moment, his life slowly fading away, and the death of [Wang Shouhua] also opened the prelude to the 412 coup.
0:9:57|0:10:21|In the chaotic streets of Shanghai, reactionary soldiers and police are arresting Communist Party members and progressive workers with impunity. They are either physically assaulted or subjected to brutal interrogations, and countless compatriots are being shot on the spot, with no regard for human rights or humanity. In no time, the white terror spreads throughout the entire city of Shanghai, engulfing the innocent in the midst of the chaotic gunfire.
0:10:21|0:10:37|The exclamation of the Shanghai people filled the air and lingered for a long time, unable to disperse. Amidst the chaos of killing in the city, [Zhou Enlai] inside the Catholic church was also under tight control. Counter-revolutionary soldiers emerged from all corners, surrounding [Zhou Enlai] with firearms.
0:10:37|0:10:44|On the Huangpu River, a large warship slowly moves forward, thick smoke billowing from its towering smokestacks.
0:10:44|0:11:6|With a loud bang, the turret at the bow of the ship twisted its steel body, aimed at the coordinates, and then, a huge flame burst out from the front of the cannon barrel. In the next second, the shell whistled out, heading straight towards the bustling city of Shanghai on the opposite bank, breaking through the air around it, tearing apart the peaceful facade of Shanghai. The shell accurately hit the Commercial Press.
0:11:6|0:11:31|The deafening explosion rang out, and the windows facing the street of the bookstore burst into a blazing fire. Countless bricks and wood chips were lifted into the air, and the dust and smoke billowed in the streets and alleys. The massive shockwave knocked the workers inside the bookstore to the ground, and the scorching firelight, for a moment, consumed all the air in the building, making it difficult to breathe.
0:11:31|0:11:51|The paper and ink in the printing house were engulfed by flames, burning uncontrollably. Before the workers could react, black-clad individuals ambushed the surroundings, wielding knives and axes, rushing into the printing house and indiscriminately attacking. Some of them even viciously hammered the curator's arms with a hammer.
0:11:54|0:12:10|These black-clad individuals have clear division of labor. Some are indiscriminately killing the staff, while others are wielding hammers to smash the printing press into pieces. The remaining people are carrying gasoline tanks, pouring them on the already packaged newspapers, and setting them on fire. Their only goal is to make the Commercial Press completely disappear.
0:12:11|0:12:32|The explosion was like a signal, causing the reactionary soldiers and police hidden in the entire city of Shanghai to swarm out. They swept through like locusts, rushing into residential and commercial shops, even on the streets without any basis, without any reason, arbitrarily arresting the people of Shanghai, plunging the entire city into the most helpless chaos.
0:12:32|0:12:38|By the time the reactionary soldiers and police finished their operation, the truck was already filled with men, women, and children with bound hands and feet.
0:12:39|0:12:46|On the other side, inside the Catholic church, security personnel were seen being disarmed, and [Zhou Enlai] stood up straight and said.
0:12:49|0:13:8|Finishing speaking, he reached for the holster at his waist, causing the surrounding reactionary soldiers to be on high alert. But seeing [Zhou Enlai] calm and composed in the face of danger, he simply opened the holster, showing it to Strel as empty. Slapping the holster on the table, he continued speaking.
0:14:16|0:14:42|At this moment, Strel finally hesitated and spoke. [Zhou Enlai], after hearing this, disregarded the soldiers around him who were aiming their guns, walked to Strel's side, leaned over the back of a chair, and whispered slowly in his ear.
0:14:47|0:15:6|Chiang Kai-shek served as the principal of the Whampoa Military Academy before the Northern Expedition, and his temperament was well understood by [Zhou Enlai], who served as the director of the political department of the military academy. Upon hearing this, Stilwell was somewhat shaken. He stood up from his seat, turned his back to the soldiers, his face dark and frightening. Although he did not personally participate in the atrocities committed by his soldiers,
0:15:6|0:15:23|Those actions were ultimately authorized by themselves. As [Zhou Enlai] said, once the situation changes, they will find it hard to escape blame. Thinking of those workers and masses who were killed or mistakenly killed, thinking of the bloody arrests being carried out by soldiers under their command, and then thinking of the Shanghai Green Gang forces cooperating with them.
0:15:23|0:15:42|In Shanghai, the Green Gang was already dominant, and now with their military backing, the gang members acted without any restraint, even more so than the reactionary military and police. Thinking of this, Stilwell suddenly felt a bit parched, so he loosened his collar, turned around, and said to [Zhou Enlai].
0:15:43|0:15:52|After a pause, he finally made up his mind and continued speaking.
0:16:0|0:16:13|[Zhou Enlai] relaxed his expression, looking dignified, smiled and nodded, then turned and walked towards the church. Opening the door, despite the pouring rain in Shanghai at that moment, [Zhou Enlai] stepped forward without hesitation.
0:16:14|0:16:21|The teacher waved his hand lightly to signal that Stilwell didn't need to say more, and [Zhou Enlai] hurriedly left the Second Division Headquarters with security.
0:16:21|0:16:35|When he was just detained, there were clear sounds of gunfire and continuous cries in the city of Shanghai, which were heard inside the church. Alert as Zhou Enlai, he quickly understood why Stilwell had invited him to control himself tonight.
0:16:35|0:16:52|During the Shanghai workers' uprising, the chief commander of the armed forces suddenly lost contact. [Zhou Enlai] dared not imagine what chaos the city would be in at this moment. He walked on a street in complete disarray, the icy rain completely soaking his clothes, clinging tightly to his skin, making [Zhou Enlai] appear particularly gaunt.
0:16:52|0:17:5|After this catastrophe, the streets were littered with the lifeless bodies of innocent civilians, their horrifying wounds oozing blood, intertwining with the pouring rain in the crevices of the cobblestones. Outside the Commercial Press, [Mao Zedong]...
0:17:5|0:17:24|The remaining warning to the people of Shanghai has been soaked in blood, with raindrops tapping on the blood and paper, just like the furious heart of [Zhou Enlai] at this moment. A wave of infinite turmoil surged. Overthrow military dictatorship, eliminate all reactionary forces, the words on the blood-stained paper are like pearls, yet to be distributed to the public.
0:17:24|0:17:47|The revolutionary movement has been stifled in its infancy by the joint efforts of reactionary military police and gang forces, which is regrettable. Some time later, in the luxurious mansion of Nanjing Hospital, [Jiang Jieshi] sat on the sofa, watching the graceful dance of foreign men and women in front of him. He waved his hand to dismiss two foreigners, then turned to [Yu Jishi] and spoke.
0:18:28|0:18:45|[Chiang Kai-shek], at this time serving as the Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army, was secretly communicating with the warlord aligned with the Fengtian clique, [Zhang Zuolin], indicating that he had completely betrayed the teachings of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the revolution. Meanwhile, the Communists were convening the Fifth Plenary Session.
0:19:22|0:19:32|Amidst the applause of the many delegates, [Chen Duxiu], seated at the main seat, stood up and gazed into the air, saying.
0:20:59|0:21:8|Chen Duxiu, who received the telegram, sat down weakly without caring about the chaotic meeting room.
0:21:19|0:21:28|The moment these words were spoken, the entire assembly was shocked beyond belief, leaving everyone speechless and the room suddenly silent, only hearing [Chen Duxiu] crying uncontrollably, heartbroken.
0:21:29|0:21:41|[Qian Dajun] was one of the earliest communists in China and also the representative of the Communist International in China. [Zhang Zuolin], incited by [Jiang Jieshi], falsely accused him of colluding with the Soviet Union to overthrow the Beiyang government of the Republic of China.
0:21:41|0:22:1|Cruelly strangled him. Everyone present was deeply influenced by Mr. Li's ideology. After a moment of shock, they stood up and took off their hats to show their respect. The only person sitting on a bench in the meeting room was dressed in coarse robes, with a center-parted hairstyle. His cheeks were extremely red and swollen with anger, and the fingers holding the cigarette butt were trembling slightly.
0:22:1|0:22:10|While everyone was still immersed in grief, he viciously stubbed out his cigarette on the ground, stood up abruptly, and shouted loudly.
0:23:14|0:23:22|The one who was extremely angry because Comrade Li Dazhao was killed and argued with the then Secretary of the Central Bureau of the CPC, [Chen Duxiu], is the future leader of China.
0:23:25|0:23:43|[Chen Duxiu] at this moment was already in a rage and unable to communicate. [Mao Zedong] had to leave the venue despite the attempts of those around him to stop him. Little did he know that his concise and forceful speech that day had already captured the attention of numerous party comrades. Several of those who resonated the most with his words would go on to leave a significant mark in history.
0:23:44|0:23:50|For example Xiang Jingyu, for example Chen Geng, for example [Su Yu].
0:24:10|0:24:17|On the other side, in Shanghai, [Zhou Enlai] looked out the window towards the sky, silently making a vow in his heart.
0:24:25|0:24:32|The woman speaking is [Deng Yingchao], who was the Secretary of the Political Department directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at the time, and also the wife of [Zhou Enlai].
0:25:9|0:25:27|Deng Yingchao walked up to him worriedly and asked. By June, the attitude of the Wuhan government towards the Communists had deteriorated significantly, understanding his wife's concerns, but revolution always comes with danger. The two of them resolutely went to Wuhan. The scene shifted, with Mao Zedong who had just finished swimming, buttoning his shirt and saying.
0:25:48|0:25:59|[Zhou Enlai] saw [Mao Zedong] handing him the cigarette, so he took it and had a puff.
0:26:3|0:26:10|Hearing the hidden meaning in Mao Zedong's words, Zhou Enlai smiled and said.
0:27:28|0:27:34|Seeing the spirited Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai had an inexplicable trust in him and asked.
0:27:39|0:27:50|Deeply looking at [Mao Zedong], [Zhou Enlai] said, and after that, the two of them smiled at each other, tightly holding hands, [Zhou Enlai] continued passionately.
0:28:7|0:28:17|Unfortunately, these words were not needed to express their deep feelings. The two of them swept away the recent gloom, embracing each other as if they had found a kindred spirit, standing together under the Wangjiang Pavilion.
0:28:25|0:28:40|[Wang Jingwei] and a group of senior military officers are in a meeting. In the midst of their conversation, a soldier enters and hands over a recently intercepted confidential report to [Wang Jingwei].
0:28:42|0:28:48|So, a nearby military officer stepped forward, read the confidential report, and [Wang Jingwei] said to him.
0:28:49|0:28:55|Watching the confidential report, a general on the field had a deep and somewhat worried look in his eyes.
0:29:2|0:29:10|As an underground Communist Party member, [Ye Ting] informed [Zhou Enlai] of the secret report.
0:29:37|0:29:47|The situation is urgent. While [Zhou Enlai] and others were busy in Wuhan, [Jiang Jieshi] in Nanjing was dancing gracefully with [Song Meiling] at a lively banquet.
0:31:7|0:31:15|Seeing [Jiang Jieshi] looking at her, she smiled brightly. On the other side, [Zhou Enlai] also paid a visit to [He Long].
0:31:51|0:31:59|Zhou Enlai waved his hand and said. [He Long] approached with excitement.
0:32:6|0:32:13|Zhou Enlai smiled, stood up from his chair, and walked over to [He Long], speaking.
0:32:51|0:33:14|[He Long] looked solemnly into the distance, the two of them chatting happily. Emotions surged as they stood by the window, hands clasped firmly. Meanwhile, in a warehouse in Wuhan, [Mao Zedong] was selecting weapons and firearms.
0:33:35|0:33:41|Looking at the silver dollar handed over by [Mao Zedong], he said. After a moment of hesitation, [Mao Zedong] handed over his pocket watch.
0:33:54|0:33:59|Nodding, [Mao Zedong] continued speaking.
0:34:10|0:34:17|On the other side, Zhou Enlai visited the widow of Mr. Sun, [Song Qingling].
0:35:27|0:35:35|She finished speaking and smiled as she shook hands with [Zhou Enlai], admiring the young man in front of her. The scene then shifted to the office building of the Wuhan government.
0:36:17|0:36:23|At this moment, another log was added in front of everyone.
0:36:36|0:36:45|Before he could finish speaking, [Zhang Fakui] was so certain that [Wang Jingwei] decided to retreat in order to advance, putting on a caring appearance and saying.
0:36:46|0:37:3|[Zhang Fakui] was somewhat helpless. He led the Fourth Army with [He Long] to fight in the north and south, with a deep friendship. He himself did not oppose the Communist Party, and a large part of his senior officers were Communist Party members. [Wang Jingwei] was pressing on step by step, and as a subordinate, he could only obey orders.
0:37:3|0:37:7|The scene shifts to the training camp of the 24th Division in Jiangxi.
0:37:38|0:37:51|On the other side, [Ye Ting] invited [He Long], [Ye Ting], and [Zhou Enlai] to discuss the response strategy for the Lushan Conference on a boat on the river. The group sat around a table eating freshly caught fish and drinking fish soup, as [Zhou Yiqun] spoke.
0:38:20|0:38:26|The fish is fresh and delicious, all thanks to [him].
0:38:33|0:38:41|[Ye Ting] called over [Su Yu], who was on duty, took the bowl from [Su Yu], who quickly said thank you and sat back on the bench. [Ye Ting] habitually chatted with [Ye Jianying] in Cantonese.
0:39:57|0:40:4|[Zhou Enlai] nodded with a smile.
0:40:13|0:40:33|After the boat meeting, [Zhou Enlai] gathered the important party leaders in the training ground to inform them of the central decision. The next morning, [Ye Ting] led his troops to station in Nanchang. His soldiers were dressed neatly and upright, sitting on horses leading the way. The soldiers were fully armed, with a strong military presence and high morale.
0:40:33|0:40:50|Outside the city, residents watched curiously along the streets, discussing animatedly. The troops marched forward and arrived outside Nanchang. The commander of the defending troops led his soldiers to block [Ye Ting] and his group within Wengcheng, and only after performing a military salute did he speak.
0:41:8|0:41:26|Ye Ting, who was standing nearby, saw that Chen Feng was being disrespectful, so he took out a notebook from his pocket and a pen from his chest, and wrote two big characters on the paper. He ordered the paper to be torn off and handed to Chen Feng by Su Yu, then spoke proudly. Just as Chen Feng was about to say something, Ye Ting shouted loudly.
0:41:32|0:41:50|Beside [Su Yu], shouting loudly, the surrounding people were inspired by him, raising their arms and cheering, welcoming the Iron Army into the city. [Ye Ting] rode his horse and led his troops rushing through the city gates. On the other side, [Jiang Jieshi] was in his office talking to his subordinates.
0:42:40|0:42:48|The scene shifts to Tongcheng County, Hubei Province, where Luo Ronghuan successfully received a large amount of military supplies. Watching the comrades busy in the courtyard, [Mao Zedong] said.
0:42:52|0:42:57|Meanwhile, in the city of Nanchang, [Zhou Enlai] also successfully met with [Zhu De].
0:44:4|0:44:13|The officer who had eaten the rice noodles first heard it and questioned Zhao Fusheng. The officer stood up with a cold face and asked Zhao Fusheng to repeat it again.
0:44:14|0:44:22|At that moment, [Ye Ting] sitting in the corner slammed the table and walked over.
0:44:36|0:44:42|He viciously struck Zhao Fusheng and then said.
0:44:48|0:44:55|The little incident here was just caught by the patrolling [Chen Feng].
0:45:58|0:46:5|[Chen Feng] held a silver dollar and knocked on Zhao Fusheng, confirming that he had accepted it, then smiled and said.
0:46:11|0:46:21|With a respectful expression, [Chen Feng] was seen off, causing a sudden change in Zhao Fusheng's face. He angrily slammed the bowl and chopsticks on the table before storming off. The scene then shifts to the military academy in Nanchang city.
0:46:32|0:46:48|The troops stationed here are well-trained, proficient in melee combat and shooting. [Zhu De] is analyzing and introducing the distribution and situation of armed forces in various locations within Nanchang city.
0:46:58|0:47:8|At the same time, [Chen Duxiu] led a group of soldiers, pretending to be filming scenery inside Nanjing city, recording the weapons configuration and personnel distribution of the stationed troops in various locations.
0:47:13|0:47:19|[Zhu De] and a group of senior generals gathered in the conference room to allocate tasks.
0:47:32|0:47:42|After the operation was swiftly carried out, cutting off the enemy's retreat, [Zhu De] placed the flag at the location of Niuxing Train Station on the map and issued a stern order. Then, looking at the surrounding generals, he pointed at the Fanta Yamen on the map with a wooden stick and said solemnly.
0:48:14|0:48:37|For a long time without any movement, [Liu Bocheng] suddenly mentioned the key point, and everyone's faces became serious. At this moment, [Zhang Guotao], a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, arrived in Nanchang and met with various generals at the Jiangxi Dajuyuan Hotel. He handed a secret letter to [Zhou Enlai] and spoke ambiguously.
0:49:39|0:49:47|[Zhang Guotao] looked at him coldly, but [He Long] didn't mind and instead turned to ask [Zhou Enlai].
0:50:42|0:50:56|Sensing the firmness of the crowd here and the subtlety of the situation, [Zhang Guotao] scrutinized his subordinates with his eyes. From their faces, [Zhang Guotao] only saw a resolute determination and fearless spirit that was bound to be carried out.
0:50:58|0:51:5|Watching [Zhang Guotao] sitting down nervously, his hand shaking as he held the cup, [Tan Pingshan] stood up and said a few words to ease the tension.
0:51:8|0:51:13|Seeing [Zhou Enlai] leading the group, raising their arms high,
0:51:28|0:51:44|At this point, there was no doubt about the Nanchang Uprising, just waiting for the right time. In the early morning of August 1, 1927, [He Long]'s stationed troops received urgent orders to assemble. All soldiers were fully armed, carrying firearms and ammunition, lining up on the training ground.
0:51:48|0:52:5|At 4 o'clock in the morning, [Zhao Fusheng] took the red scarf and white towel handed to him by the company commander. Seeing the soldiers around him earnestly tying them on, he knew that something big was going to happen in Nanchang tonight. So, he rubbed the towel on his mouth haphazardly and left the barracks while everyone was busy.
0:52:5|0:52:11|Meanwhile, [Zhu De] hosted a banquet at the guesthouse in the city, entertaining senior military commanders stationed in Nanchang.
0:52:46|0:52:56|[Zhu De] clapped his hands twice, and amidst the excited cheers of the officers, a group of beautiful and charming singers walked in gracefully.
0:53:36|0:53:55|The sudden turn of events made the faces of everyone in the council chamber even more serious. As the agreed time approached, preparations for the uprising had already begun. [Su Yu] led a small team of soldiers under the cover of night, quietly infiltrating the Niuxing Station, removing the sentries from high positions and replacing them.
0:53:55|0:54:4|They vigilantly aimed at the inside of the station, monitoring every move of the stationed troops, [Su Yu] spoke up to remind the soldiers.
0:54:13|0:54:28|As feared by [Zhou Enlai] and others, Zhao Fusheng eventually leaked the news of the uprising to Chen Feng. Outside the Gongyuan where the 23rd Regiment was stationed, the uprising soldiers had already taken care of the sentries and were ambushed in the surroundings waiting for the signal to start the uprising. On the other side,
0:54:28|0:54:36|Chen Feng, who received a secret report from Zhao Fusheng, wasted no time and hurriedly strode into the local government office, shouting at the subordinates inside.
0:54:41|0:54:49|However, the idle soldiers, accustomed to leisure, paid no attention to the commander's words. The chatting continued unabated, and those playing cards acted as if they hadn't heard a thing.
0:54:49|0:55:5|Chen Feng watched as the soldier who rushed out of the dormitory upon hearing the order, with his uniform in disarray and knocking over a basin, soaked from head to toe. He couldn't help but feel sorrow in his heart, took off his military cap and burst into laughter, waving to call the soldier over to him.
0:55:5|0:55:26|Chen Feng waved his hand and slapped it up, surprising the people around [Chen Feng], who stopped laughing and looked at [Chen Feng], only to see him bend down and say to the soldier in front of him.
0:55:32|0:55:40|With this example, the soldiers finally realized the seriousness of the situation and armed themselves in a hurry. Inside the conference hall on the other side, [Zhou Enlai] asked. Ready.
0:55:52|0:56:5|The time for the uprising is approaching. The perimeters of the garrisons in the city have been infiltrated and surrounded by the rebels. They only await a signal from headquarters to swiftly attack and capture the positions before the enemy can react.
0:56:5|0:56:19|At this moment, in the quiet and tense atmosphere before the big battle, enveloping the Jiangxi Grand Hotel, everyone was serious, especially [Zhou Enlai]. He was repeatedly going over the plan in his mind, determined to ensure the success of the uprising.
0:56:20|0:56:31|Finally, he stood up and walked towards the door, with everyone following closely behind. When they reached the entrance of the inn, [Zhou Enlai] pulled out his handgun from his waist and fired three shots into the night sky.
0:56:34|0:56:41|Due to Zhao Fusheng's reasons, the Nanchang Uprising officially broke out at 2 a.m. on August 1st.
0:56:46|0:56:59|Upon hearing the signal, [He Long], although unaware of the reason for the early plan, acted decisively and immediately commanded his soldiers to prepare to capture the local government office. At the same time, the artillery units outside the city received the signal and provided immediate fire support.
0:57:1|0:57:6|The artillery fire covered the garrisons' positions everywhere except for the provincial yamen. The provincial yamen was located in the city, adjacent to residential areas.
0:57:7|0:57:19|The rebel army spared civilian casualties and did not shell this area. The defending troops in other places were powerless against the bombardment and fled in haste. Before long, [Zhou Enlai] received the news of victory.
0:57:21|0:57:34|On the other side, the soldiers ambushed outside the train station advanced to the barracks, threw grenades into the room, and then rushed in, effortlessly subduing the dizzy and confused enemies.
0:57:47|0:58:3|In the command post of the provincial yamen, [Chen Feng] was furious upon learning that Niuxing Railway Station had fallen, and he angrily slammed the phone in front of him to the ground. On the side of the revolutionary army, after the dispersal of the artillery fire, the soldiers hidden everywhere rushed into the residence of the Gong Academy.
0:58:3|0:58:20|Keeping an eye on the armband and scarf, the battle was quickly resolved. With the city engulfed in continuous artillery fire and the sound of gunfire, the massive commotion finally reached the elegant atmosphere of the guesthouse. [Zhu De] looked at the quiet crowd and smiled, saying.
0:58:24|0:58:37|The enemy generals present were not fools. Sensing the commotion, they immediately pushed aside the soft and fragrant beauty beside them and hurriedly ran out of the building. However, they were shocked back by a shot fired by [Zhu De] into the air. Looking around, they found themselves already surrounded by armed soldiers of the uprising.
0:58:37|0:58:56|They only realized that the so-called banquet reception was just to disrupt the command system of the Kuomintang army. Occupying the positions of the garrison troops, all units gradually converged and rushed to the vicinity of the city gate tower to start the assault. The enemy here, holding the high ground and well-equipped, put up a very stubborn resistance.
0:58:56|0:59:12|Enemy generals commanded their soldiers to set up machine guns on the high buildings in the city, madly shooting at the uprising forces below. Under the cover of night, countless streaks of fire resembled snakes spitting venom, instilling fear in all who beheld them. The exploding flames were like a second sun, illuminating the city as if it were daytime.
0:59:14|0:59:29|Rebel soldiers charged forward with their flesh and blood, fearless of death. However, the terrain here was treacherous and difficult to attack, and due to concerns for civilians, the artillery outside the city could not provide full support, resulting in a stalemate in the battle.
0:59:31|0:59:39|In the command post of the provincial government office, [Chen Feng], after receiving the battle report, was exhausted and sat at the table with a water cup in hand, lowering his head.
0:59:39|0:59:54|He knew that if any part of the main street and city gate were lost, his yamen would be captured by the rebels, it was only a matter of time. So, he cleared his mind, somewhat tired yet very determined, and ordered decisively.
1:0:6|1:0:18|The scene shifts to the main street battlefield. [He Long] leads his troops deep into the battlefront, charging at the forefront. His soldiers, known as the Iron Army, sweep through the enemy ranks like a sharp blade cutting through their core.
1:0:20|1:0:44|However, this iron army was blocked near a clock tower on the main street. [He Long], who loved his soldiers like his own children, saw a soldier fall to the ground with a gunshot wound near the clock tower. He ordered his deputy to throw a bag of flour, then he raised his gun and shot, causing a cloud of dust to rise and obscure the enemy's view on the clock tower. [He Long] quickly ordered the injured soldier to be dragged back to cover. Taking advantage of this distraction, the deputy picked up an explosive pack and charged towards the base of the clock tower.
1:0:44|1:0:55|He Long immediately ordered the entire army to provide cover fire, and finally a huge explosion shattered the bell tower, losing the high ground firepower point. The enemy forces could no longer resist the assault of [He Long]'s troops and were defeated one after another.
1:0:56|1:1:2|Meanwhile, [Su Yu] inside the train station led his troops towards the city gate.
1:1:29|1:1:42|On the other side, the Jiangxi Bank controlled by foreign forces was also occupied by the rebel army. They wrote receipts and used gold bars and other items as military funds. [Chen Feng] saluted the staff and then led the troops away.
1:1:49|1:1:56|Remembering to tie a red ribbon on the collar and a white towel on the arm, the isolated [Chen Feng] had no choice but to disguise himself and slip out of the city to request support. Little did he know, the small team of soldiers he sent out,
1:2:2|1:2:10|Suddenly remembering the order from [Zhou Enlai], Su Yu's gaze fell on the opponent's arm.
1:2:13|1:2:24|Seeing the six people with white towels wrapped neatly around their left arms, he knew they were enemies, not friends, so he decisively opened fire and shot them on the spot. [Chen Feng] clung to the fantasy of waiting for reinforcements.
1:2:24|1:2:35|The illusion was shattered. The high alertness and the deafening close-range gunfire made the newly arrived young soldier collapse on the ground, screaming in fear. [Su Yu] snapped out of it and walked up to him, roaring.
1:2:47|1:2:54|Hearing that the allied forces at the front were blocked, [Ye Ting] in the council chamber took command to go into battle, quickly organizing his subordinates to rush to the main street for support.
1:2:59|1:3:12|With the war intensifying, the provincial government office was already in chaos, with injured soldiers being carried in one after another. Only [Chen Feng] remained at the command table, with all manpower sent to the front lines to block the rebel army.
1:3:12|1:3:24|At this time, [Chen Feng] was already at his wit's end, and upon hearing the report from his deputy, he felt a deep sense of sorrow. Knowing that defending the city was hopeless, he couldn't contain his anger, and he let loose, preparing for a desperate fight to the death.
1:3:24|1:3:34|He rushed to the front line with his aide without saying a word, pulled the soldier operating the machine gun, crouched behind the sandbag cover himself, operated the machine gun, and fired wildly at the troops of [He Long] in front.
1:3:35|1:3:50|Suddenly, a large number of rebel soldiers were splattered with blood and fell to the ground. [He Long] quickly ordered everyone to find cover and take cover, while he took the opportunity when [Chen Feng] was reloading to spray a burst of bullets from his submachine gun at the enemy machine gun.
1:3:50|1:3:57|[Chen Feng] was shot in the left shoulder, but with sheer determination, he quickly reloaded and continued firing at the rebel army, forcing [He Long] to retreat.
1:4:10|1:4:25|The bugle sounded, and countless rebels raised their flags, braving the enemy's fierce gunfire and charging towards the battlefield. At this moment, the main street of Nanchang was ablaze, with explosions throwing up sand and rocks, leaving the entire street unrecognizable.
1:4:26|1:4:44|The rebel forces each found good cover and engaged in bloody battles with the defending troops in front of them. However, the elite troops defending this position are all under the command of [Chen Feng]. At this moment, [Chen Feng] himself is on the battlefield, severely wounded but refusing to leave the front line. Although the defending troops at the outpost are usually lax, they are now fighting to the death, with even the commander engaging in the battle.
1:4:44|1:5:5|In the face of gunfire and bullets, the army led by [Ye Ting] launched multiple attacks but was repelled by the enemy, leaving countless bodies on the main street, blood flowing everywhere, and heavy casualties among the rebels. Upon hearing the news, [Zhou Enlai] couldn't help but furrow his brow, feeling endless worry in his heart. On the other side,
1:5:5|1:5:10|On the bloody battlefield, countless wounded soldiers are waiting for rescue.
1:5:23|1:5:41|Just as Peng Yuanhua hurriedly rescued the wounded, the rebel soldiers finally advanced within mortar range. The close-range shooting was precise enough not to cause harm to civilians. The soldiers set up the mortar, aimed at the trenches, and adjusted the firing angle.
1:5:43|1:6:0|With a command from [He Long], three mortars fired simultaneously, and the shells whistled towards the enemy trenches. In the distance, [Chen Feng] was still engaged in combat with the frontal troops. Suddenly, he seemed to hear the muffled sound of the cannons, slowly turned his head, and the next moment, three shells exploded in the middle of the trench.
1:6:0|1:6:8|[Chen Feng], along with his stubborn soldiers, were engulfed by the raging flames. On the other side, at the Deshengmen battlefield,
1:6:8|1:6:26|After experiencing bloody battles, the rebel army finally advanced and stabilized their position. After ensuring that civilians were not harmed, they brought in mortars and field guns. [Ye Ting] remained calm in the face of danger, standing behind the artillery, ordering the troops to load ammunition and adjust the firing angle.
1:6:29|1:6:34|Upon hearing the news, [Zhou Enlai] turned around and gazed intently at the map of Deshengmen.
1:6:36|1:6:49|On the battlefield, [Ye Ting] fired his gun as a signal, and more than ten cannons erupted with smoke and sparks, causing the soldiers present to feel the ground trembling slightly. Following that, the shells shot out of the barrels, accurately smashing towards the city gate tower.
1:6:52|1:7:5|Receiving the military order, the troops continuously changed ammunition and fired towards the city gate tower. For a moment, in this area, the smell of gunpowder was so strong that it seemed to ignite the air, and the enemy troops were suppressed in the city tower, unable to move.
1:7:11|1:7:28|Taking advantage of the cover of artillery fire, [Su Yu] led a small team of soldiers to sneak into the trenches outside the city wall. As the shells touched the wall and raised countless dust and smoke, [Su Yu] waved his big knife and leaped up, directly chopping off the enemy's arm operating the machine gun. He locked eyes with [Ye Ting], understanding each other without words.
1:7:32|1:7:42|When [Su Yu] temporarily withdrew, [Ye Ting] signaled the troops to continue shelling Deshengmen, while [Su Yu] led a small team to bypass to the side of the city gate, braving the artillery fire to defeat the remaining enemies.
1:7:43|1:7:55|The two of them cooperated seamlessly, making it difficult for the enemy to defend. Without much effort, [Su Yu] led his men to charge up the city tower.
1:7:56|1:8:7|The bombardment continued, and after the machine gunner on the city tower was taken care of, [Ye Ting] shifted his artillery fire towards the trenches near the tower, because he knew that the remaining enemy soldiers were no match for [Su Yu].
1:8:7|1:8:15|Sure enough, at the moment when the artillery fire shifted direction, [Su Yu] knew his opportunity had come. Leading by example, he charged forward with a rifle in hand.
1:8:23|1:8:34|The Deshengmen Gate has finally been captured, the great battle is won. [Ye Ting] excitedly roared, his soldiers raised the flag high and rushed into the city tower to assist [Su Yu] in dealing with the enemy prisoners.
1:8:34|1:8:59|On the other side, the good news was also relayed back to the council chamber. Upon hearing the news, [Zhou Enlai]’s face showed a hint of joy for the first time, but it quickly disappeared. Perhaps he was thinking of the comrades who bravely sacrificed in this battle, or perhaps he was contemplating the arduous journey of struggle after the success of the uprising.
1:8:59|1:9:5|As a key figure of the Communist Party, he had to force himself to see further, even further.
1:9:8|1:9:24|In the chaotic feudal yamen, Zhao Fusheng, who saw the situation was already lost, harbored a fluke mentality. He changed into the armband and scarf of the rebel army, pretended to be one of the soldiers, and escorted the prisoners along with others.
1:9:29|1:9:43|In the dimly lit command post, the soldiers did not notice the nervousness and guilt on [Zhao Fusheng]'s face. However, when he arrived at the open square illuminated by the fire, his cautious demeanor seemed out of place compared to the victorious soldiers.
1:9:43|1:9:58|He Long, who respected Chen Feng for sacrificing himself, silently saluted in front of the trench, paying tribute to this dedicated man. Then he turned around and saw the slightly shrinking Zhao Fusheng. With a cold face, he slowly walked towards him.
1:9:58|1:10:8|Zhao Fusheng, feeling guilty as a thief, knew from the stern expression on [He Long]'s face that his secret had been exposed. He hurriedly knelt on the ground, ready to beg for mercy.
1:10:12|1:10:19|However, the stern [He Long] did not give him a chance to speak, aiming and shooting a single shot to end the traitor.
1:10:20|1:10:39|After hours of bloody fighting, Nanchang City was finally taken down completely. By the time the rebel army cleaned up the battlefield, the sky was already getting light. People gathered outside the Grand Hotel, and with [Zhou Enlai] raising his arms and shouting, all the soldiers present cheered excitedly.
1:10:39|1:10:56|They raised their rifles high and waved the big flag in their arms. [Zhou Enlai] was also deeply moved, he almost trembled as he walked outside to greet [Ye Ting] and others who were equally excited. They embraced tightly, laughed heartily, and released the long-held resentment of being at the mercy of others.
1:10:58|1:11:6|The Chinese Communist Party finally established its own armed forces.
1:11:11|1:11:25|The soldier who arrived late and had a heated conversation with [Su Yu] is named [Lin Biao], they met at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party. At that time, they were Nationalist soldiers guarding outside the council chamber, but now they are Communist soldiers who have experienced the baptism of war.
1:11:27|1:11:34|Squeezed in the crowd, they cheered and celebrated the victory of the struggle together with numerous rebel soldiers and the people of Nanchang.
1:11:35|1:11:43|While [Zhou Enlai] resumed his usual serious demeanor, he continued to plan and worry about the future of the revolution.
1:12:51|1:12:58|[Jiang Jieshi] placed his chess pieces down and spoke slowly.
1:14:45|1:14:53|Nie Rongzhen came this time to organize more than two regiments of the 25th Division of Zhang Fakui's troops to join the uprising army, strengthening the armed forces of the Communist Party.
1:14:53|1:15:4|The morale of the guerrilla army was unprecedentedly high. When all affairs were in order, on August 3, 1927, [Zhou Enlai] led the rebel forces to withdraw from Nanchang, Jiangxi, and headed south along the Fu River.
1:15:4|1:15:14|Advanced towards Guangdong Chaoshan and Shantou. On August 7 of the same year, in an apartment in Hankou, the Chinese Communist Party held an emergency meeting of the Central Committee. The Communist International believed that the mistakes of Borodin and [Chen Duxiu] were serious.
1:15:20|1:15:28|Qu Qiubai, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, was diligently taking notes and translating the speech of the Comintern representative, Lozovsky.
1:15:41|1:15:49|As Qu Qiubai finished speaking, the delegates couldn't wait to applaud. Meanwhile, outside the door, [Mao Zedong]...
1:17:18|1:17:28|The meeting ended, Qu Qiubai and [Ren Bishi] came to the outside of the room and stopped [Mao Zedong], who was about to leave.
1:18:11|1:18:33|On a rainy autumn day in Hankou, three people stood in the rain, soaking their backs. After listening to the two, [Mao Zedong] spoke. He ultimately did not agree to the requests of the two comrades, because in [Mao Zedong]'s heart, a new path of struggle was brewing, a path that no one had yet taken, and he firmly believed that this path was exactly what China urgently needed.
1:18:33|1:18:49|After finishing speaking, he left Hankou, walking in the rain with an umbrella. While the rebel army was marching south with great momentum, [Mao Zedong] returned to Changsha, where had already been tormented by the reactionary warlords and lost its vitality.
1:18:49|1:19:6|Reactionary military forces are freely killing Communist Party members in the streets and alleys, not hesitating to make mistakes. Everywhere on the road, there are bloody and mutilated corpses, who may be comrades or just ordinary people. The people in Changsha are in panic, and [Mao Zedong] returns home with complex worries.
1:19:6|1:19:15|Sitting on a bench in the courtyard, Mao Zedong watched the three young children for a while, and finally said to his wife [Yang Kaihui] who was inside helping him pack his luggage.
1:19:34|1:19:53|With a worried look on his face, [Mao Zedong] finally showed a hint of a smile upon hearing [Yang Kaihui]'s words. Inside the room, [Yang Kaihui] noticed her husband's dilemma and hesitation. She walked out and gently sat beside [Mao Zedong], looking at her somewhat tall and slender wife. [Mao Zedong] felt an indescribable sense of guilt in his heart.
1:20:17|1:20:27|Without waiting for [Mao Zedong] to finish speaking, [Yang Kaihui] gently and firmly took her husband's arm, soothing Mao Zedong's restless mind with the most sincere words of affection.
1:20:27|1:20:46|When the comrades from the party came to pick him up, [Mao Zedong] had to leave again. The family stood at the village entrance, with two slightly older children holding onto their mother's clothes. The young children couldn't stop crying, and [Yang Kaihui] held them in her arms. This scene was what [Mao Zedong] saw in his eyes. He stepped forward, rubbed the children's heads, and was about to speak.
1:20:49|1:20:58|[Mao Zedong] knew his wife's good intentions, but the more [Yang Kaihui] was like this, the more he couldn't let go. He dared not look at his wife's thin cheeks, hesitated, and turned away.
1:21:15|1:21:29|[Mao Zedong], who was about to turn back, was being scolded by his wife. He turned around again and walked forward slowly, as if reluctant to leave his beloved family. In this empty village,
1:21:31|1:21:48|The traces of their past lives, at this moment, are pulling at the soul of [Mao Zedong], leaving a part of it forever in Banchang Village. And the woman who has been by his side since the beginning of the revolution, silently supporting him, finally shed tears when she saw her husband's increasingly distant figure.
1:21:48|1:22:1|[Yang Kaihui] tightened her grip on her child's arm, the warmth in her embrace being her only solace. The loving couple never imagined that this separation would become their final farewell.
1:22:11|1:22:18|With the voice of [Wang Jingwei]'s aide, the screen shows the fierce scene of [Ye Ting] leading the uprising army in battle.
1:22:27|1:22:37|[Wang Jingwei] practiced calligraphy, seemingly unaffected by the bloody battles in the early morning, where the lives of those dead Chinese children and women were lost.
1:22:41|1:22:46|[Qian Dajun] was the commander of the 32nd Army and one of [Jiang Jieshi]'s key aides.
1:23:48|1:23:54|Presenting the application letter, and saluting [Zhou Enlai] with a standard military salute, [He Long] officially applied to join the party.
1:23:54|1:24:8|The crowd on the scene was deeply moved. In the face of the crisis facing the revolutionary army, their firm decision to join the party undoubtedly injected a strong dose of encouragement to everyone. [Zhou Enlai] was also greatly moved, to the extent that at this moment he did not adhere to military discipline and regulations.
1:24:8|1:24:26|He extended his right hand and tightly shook hands with [He Long], then embraced each other, expressing their excitement beyond words. The scene then shifted to the Tungkung Mountains in Jiangxi, where [Mao Zedong] was unexpectedly captured by bandits in the mountains.
1:24:40|1:24:44|Glancing at the leader who went to relieve himself, [Mao Zedong] pointed to his own crotch with his chin.
1:24:56|1:25:12|Two bandits, somewhat decent, untied the rope binding [Mao Zedong]'s hands after receiving the money, gesturing for him to run forward quickly. After [Mao Zedong] had run a distance, the bandits fired a shot into the air, pretending to shout in panic.
1:25:13|1:25:24|Hearing the gunshots and shouts, [Mao Zedong] didn't dare to delay, he ran swiftly through the bamboo forest, accidentally fell into a shallow pit, and then hid and lurked down, cautiously peeking out to look around.
1:25:25|1:25:42|Suddenly, three rifles were pointed at [Mao Zedong]'s face. Helplessly turning around, the first thing he saw was several soldiers in military uniforms of the Kuomintang, with red and white armbands on their collars and left arms. [Mao Zedong] weakly leaned against a pile of soil and smiled, because he knew he was finally safe.
1:25:42|1:25:50|So they arrived at the base of the rebel army together with the soldiers. The soldiers, who did not yet know their identities, reported to the officer.
1:25:57|1:26:6|The officer walked slowly to [Mao Zedong]'s front and sat down, paused for a moment, and asked him.
1:27:7|1:27:22|[Mao Zedong] did not answer, but walked to the front of the Kuomintang flag, lit the cigarette at the corner of his mouth, furrowed his brow, as if thinking about something. The crying next door kept touching his heart, making him unable to speak for a long time. So, an officer explained.
1:28:0|1:28:20|Upon hearing Lu Deming's question, Mao Zedong pondered for a moment, then quickly returned to the table, dipped his brush in ink and wrote down a few large characters on the paper. He lifted the paper and showed it to everyone, revealing a banner with the words "First Army, First Division of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army" written from top to bottom. Mao Zedong spoke,
1:28:22|1:28:33|After gaining everyone's approval, the group began to design a new flag for the uprising army. After much discussion, they finally decided to choose red as the base color for the flag, completely different from the flag of the Kuomintang.
1:28:33|1:28:51|In the center is a five-pointed star representing the leadership of the Communist Party, with a sickle and hammer embedded inside the star symbolizing the alliance of workers and peasants. A cloth strip is sewn on one side of the flag near the flagpole, with eleven characters in regular script vertically written, "1st Army, 1st Division of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army". This is the first military flag of the Chinese Communist Party.
1:28:51|1:29:14|On September 9, 1927, waving the newly designed military flag, [Lu Deming] and [Mao Zedong] led a group and set off to the border of Jiangxi and Hunan. Ten days later, in most counties of Guangdong Province, the rebel army led by [Zhou Enlai] established a temporary command post here. It was mealtime, and the kitchen staff in the courtyard were busy preparing food.
1:30:15|1:30:24|Although the words were spoken like this, everyone knew the difficulty of this battle. [Zhou Enlai] solemnly walked up to [Zhu De] and before he could speak, he heard him speak first.
1:30:28|1:30:45|Upon hearing this, [Zhou Enlai]'s facial muscles twitched slightly, as he gazed at the old comrades and senior leaders in front of him. He slowly reached out his hand to shake hands with [Zhu De]. Colleagues beside him were also extremely serious, with determination like [He Long] causing his eyes to well up, and boldness like [Ye Ting] cooling his countenance.
1:30:45|1:30:51|On the other side, in Shangping Village, Hunan Province, [Lu Deming] gathered the soldiers together.
1:31:41|1:31:48|In the middle of the square, [Mao Zedong] looked around at the soldiers shouting with all their might, his eyes filled with severity and his face showing concern.
1:31:50|1:31:57|Walking down from the high platform, [Mao Zedong] approached [Lu Deming] and patted his shoulder, saying heavily.
1:32:4|1:32:14|The reactionary forces showed no sign of retreat, with troops continuously closing in, seemingly intent on wiping out the revolutionary army. As the two of them reached halfway, the rear guard of the Third Division suddenly found themselves ambushed by enemy forces from multiple directions, hastily engaging in battle and suffering heavy losses.
1:32:18|1:32:26|To cover the retreat of the main force, [Lu Deming] personally led a platoon to ambush the enemy, while the scattered soldiers of the third regiment quickly closed in on the vanguard.
1:32:26|1:32:46|However, at that moment, a bullet tore through the air and struck [Lu Deming] directly in the right chest, causing a horrifying gush of blood to flow from the wound, staining his clothes in an instant. Soldiers shielded and dragged [Lu Deming], who had fallen to the ground, evacuating him from the battlefield.
1:32:47|1:33:2|The scene of living and fighting together with [Lu Deming] still lingers in [Mao Zedong]'s mind, but now they are worlds apart.
1:33:12|1:33:38|Comrade [Lu Deming], covered with the flags of the revolutionary army of workers and peasants and the vast sky, lying on a simple yet solemn and sacred straw mat on the ground, slept deeply at this most solemn memorial ceremony. He slept until the scorching and relentless flames enveloped him, turning his flesh and bones into revolutionary sparks, entrusted in the hearts of every soldier, forever wandering on the land of China.
1:33:38|1:34:0|At the same time, at Sanheba in Guangzhou, [Zhu De] was leading three thousand rebel soldiers to dig trenches. He arrived at the front line and personally supervised the preparations before the battle. Facing an enemy ten times larger than his own forces, even [Zhu De] couldn't help but feel immense pressure. He reminded the busy soldiers, saying:
1:34:16|1:34:39|[Su Yu] sat on the sandbags on the high ground, casually picked up a dry branch, and sketched the terrain of the entire Sanhe Dam on the ground, greedily craving for the cigarette at the corner of his mouth, frowning, occasionally looking around at the mountains, rivers, and comparing them with the map he drew, perfecting the ambush plan in his mind, and finally summoning his subordinates and generals.
1:35:16|1:35:27|Assigned with their tasks, the serious and solemn demeanor of the generals made [Zhu De] feel somewhat reassured. However, as he watched their young and inexperienced figures, [Zhu De] couldn't help but stand up to remind everyone.
1:35:46|1:35:54|The next to face [Zhu De] and the 3000 uprising soldiers will be a fierce attack from the former Grand Army.
1:36:46|1:37:6|On the other side, [Mao Zedong] has successfully led the revolutionary army to break through and establish a base in Jinggangshan. Here, he will guide his soldiers and the local people to establish the first revolutionary base of the Communist Party of China, exploring the correct path of surrounding the cities with rural areas and seizing power through armed struggle, a path that previous revolutionaries had not taken.
1:37:6|1:37:19|Compared to Mao Zedong's revolutionary army, the situation of Zhu De and Zhou Enlai's rebel army is much more difficult. Leading a large force retreating to Guangdong, Zhou Enlai is constantly worried about the safety of Zhu De and his 3000 soldiers.
1:37:19|1:37:35|Looking at the completed trench works at Sanheba, the young soldiers on high alert, and the heavily guarded enemy camp across the river, [Zhu De] felt the same level of concern. Unlike [Zhou Enlai], [Zhu De] was not worried about his own life, but whether they could withstand the pressure.
1:37:35|1:37:41|Defend the Sanhe Dam until the main forces withdraw. How many of the soldiers who fought together against the enemy can survive,
1:37:42|1:38:2|He dared not dwell on it, only firmly telling himself, "I must hold on, and I will hold on." On October 1, 1927, the former General Headquarters on the opposite side of the river was fully assembled. [Zhu De] immediately ordered the soldiers to be ready for battle, while across the river, [Qian Dajun]'s troops were observing the positions of the uprising army through binoculars.
1:38:2|1:38:6|The aide reported to him that the enemy had defenses set up all along the opposite bank for over 10 miles.
1:38:24|1:38:33|The military order was as solid as a mountain, and the deputy general immediately dispatched his fourth regiment to cross the cold river on bamboo rafts. Upon noticing this, the rebels quickly reported to Zhu De.
1:38:34|1:38:56|The enemy forces have begun to attack. Upon hearing the battle report, [Zhu De] did not show much emotional fluctuation. After several days of preparation, he, who had already set life and death aside, must now face the impending fierce battle with enough composure. Whether there are 30,000 or 300,000 enemy troops in front of him, he must defend Sanheba for three days, ensuring that the revolutionary spark is not extinguished here.
1:38:56|1:39:15|With such determination and fighting spirit, [Zhu De] had already set up a small ambush on the mudflats where the enemy might land, waiting for the right moment. In the nearby rocky cave, [Chen Yi] and [Lin Biao] led troops in ambush, covered with grass mats, hidden among the dense trees, holding their guns alertly.
1:39:15|1:39:23|Even though the enemy had entered shooting range, they still did not open fire, quietly waiting for [Zhu De]'s command.
1:39:26|1:39:35|Lowering his binoculars, [Zhu De] said. [Zhu De] did not order an attack, knowing that this small group of troops could not be the main force of [Qian Dajun]'s army.
1:39:35|1:39:46|At the beginning of the conflict, the enemy sent a troop to land, most likely to probe the strength of the rebel army, so the first battle had to be fought steadily and fiercely.
1:39:48|1:40:5|The enemy vanguard has landed at Shizi'an, slowly advancing towards the ambush circle. The soldiers' palms are sweating, their breathing quickens, and their hearts race, but still not a single shot is fired. Finally, [Zhu De] shouts out, giving the command to open fire with both light and heavy weapons.
1:40:6|1:40:28|Upon receiving the order, [Lin Biao] lifted the grass mat and swung his arm, continuously throwing grenades towards the enemy troops. With no cover on the narrow beach, the enemy soldiers had nowhere to hide, only able to watch as the grenades exploded in the crowd, causing numerous casualties, lying on the shore. Ahead was the fierce gunfire of the rebels, while behind was the icy cold river.
1:40:28|1:40:35|On the other side, [Qian Dajun] saw the Fourth Division in a dilemma, with bodies lying on the river. He put down his binoculars and gave the order.
1:40:48|1:40:55|After careful adjustments, numerous field guns on the enemy artillery positions opened fire together, and the shells were heading straight towards the rebel positions.
1:40:56|1:41:16|Feeling the vibration of the earth and the whistling sound of the air, [Lin Biao] shouted loudly, ordering the soldiers to retreat. The next moment, the shells fiercely hit the stone cave. Whether it was the enemy's 4th regiment or the rebel soldiers, facing such a large-scale and indiscriminate bombing, they had no time to think about anything else but to dodge and avoid.
1:41:16|1:41:22|[Zhu De] saw the situation and anxiously jumped down from the high ground, roaring to order the soldiers to enter the trenches to avoid the bombing.
1:41:25|1:41:40|The artillery on the opposite bank is still firing without any intention of stopping, while on the other side of the stone cave, it has become indiscriminate between friend and foe, with people doing their best to avoid the bombing. Thanks to [Lin Biao]'s reminder, some of the rebel soldiers retreated backwards, and the impact on them was not significant.
1:41:40|1:41:58|However, the soldiers on the front line fighting against the enemy had no time to react. They were overturned by the explosion of shells, blood flowing out from their wounds, wrapping their bodies entirely. The dust raised by the shockwave scattered over the stone cave, flames ignited by the explosion,
1:41:58|1:42:8|The uprising soldiers were tortured and let out painful screams. While [Zhu De]'s position was also under artillery fire, he did not slack off at all as the soldiers scrambled to take cover.
1:42:18|1:42:38|The number of troops on both sides was already vastly different. If they were to be defeated by this artillery barrage, holding onto Sanheba would be nothing but a pipe dream. Just as [Zhu De] anxiously directed the soldiers to take cover, [Lin Biao] on the other side also came under bombardment from follow-up shells. With no place to hide on the exposed mudflat, he had no choice but to order the soldiers to seek shelter in the shell craters.
1:42:38|1:42:46|The deafening artillery fire finally ceased after a period of time, but [Qian Dajun] discontentedly asked.
1:42:54|1:43:13|After listening to the report, [Qian Dajun] said nothing more, just handed the binoculars to his deputy and left the front line in a huff. After the devastating shelling, [Qian Dajun] also gave up the plan to continue the attack. On the ambush circle and positions of the uprising army, the bodies of both enemy and friendly forces were scattered.
1:43:13|1:43:31|The scene is littered with craters, with flames still flickering sparsely on the bomb craters, like hollow eyes staring fiercely at the sky. The river adjacent to the mudflat has been thoroughly soaked in blood, as if the life source of the rebel soldiers has made this icy river boiling hot.
1:43:31|1:43:45|After the shelling, the position where [Zhu De] was located also suffered heavy losses, with a large number of soldiers who did not have time to retreat into the trenches dying miserably on the mounds. Countless soldiers affected by the explosion were ragged and had limbs severed.
1:44:1|1:44:26|He walked heavily beside the wounded soldiers, silent. Looking up, he saw the densely packed bodies piled in the tunnel, [Zhu De] paused. The soldiers' blood mixed with the river water and mud flowed in the gullies, the originally designed drainage ditches now filled with blood, a shocking sight.
1:44:26|1:44:47|The young bodies lay quietly on the ground, also lying bloodily in [Zhu De]'s heart. The soldiers who could still move slowly took off their military caps with [Zhu De], and even the toughest men shed muddy tears at this moment. At this moment, Sanheba was eerily quiet.
1:44:58|1:45:10|After hearing the reports of the losses from the generals, [Zhu De] could not hide his anger. He pounded the table fiercely, then stood up and walked to the sand table in front of him, calculating the strategies for the future coldly.
1:45:10|1:45:27|The next day, to replenish ammunition, [Lin Biao] led a small team back to the stone bank, cleaning up the battlefield, collecting supplies. The strong smell of gunpowder and the burning odor of corpses constantly stimulated the rebel soldiers.
1:45:27|1:45:42|And at that moment, the enemy's attack resumed, with a large amount of bullets and artillery pouring down on the rocky shore. [Lin Biao] had no choice but to do his best to cover the retreat of the small team. Across the river, the main army was observing everything through binoculars.
1:45:44|1:45:51|[Lin Biao] led his troops to quickly evacuate to the vicinity of Longhukeng, and said to [Chen Yi] who was ambushed here.
1:45:52|1:46:5|The handover is completed, [Lin Biao] rushes back to the original front line without stopping, while [Chen Yi] sets up a machine gun at the forefront of the ambush circle in the Longhukeng with grass covering, looking from afar, the enemy is densely advancing towards the rebel army.
1:46:5|1:46:15|When the enemy got close enough, [Chen Yi] was the first to pull the trigger, and a stream of fire burst from the muzzle. The next second, the bullet pierced through the enemy's body, blood splattering everywhere.
1:46:27|1:46:40|Following the voice of the adjutant, the scene shifted to the frontline position of the rebel army. Sure enough, under the command of [Qian Dajun], all soldiers of the Third Regiment were marching towards the position on foot. As the battle approached, only to hear a shout from [Zhu De],
1:46:40|1:46:48|In an instant, the entire front line was filled with continuous gunfire. When the enemy got close enough, [Zhu De] seized the opportunity and shouted loudly. Upon hearing the command,
1:46:50|1:46:56|The soldier threw the grenade without hesitation, and the explosion instantly engulfed the enemy troops charging ahead.
1:46:59|1:47:11|Seeing the machine gunner being killed by the enemy's grenade, [Zhu De] felt both distressed and anxious, shouting for someone to take over. [Lin Biao], who had just rushed back to the front line, happened to witness this scene and did not dare to hesitate at all.
1:47:11|1:47:23|Leading the soldiers, [Zhu De] ran non-stop to the tunnel to operate the machine gun. As the commander, [Zhu De] also picked up a rifle to cover [Lin Biao] who was reloading, countless enemy soldiers trying to take advantage of the situation and rush into the position.
1:47:23|1:47:39|All of them were accurately shot dead by him. When all the machine guns opened fire again, the enemy's hard-won advance line was forced to retreat, leaving only blood and corpses on the ground. With such shocking casualties, [Qian Dajun] had to temporarily halt the attack of the Third Battalion.
1:47:39|1:47:45|In the Longhukeng battlefield, [Chen Yi] also repelled a group of enemy troops and is now cleaning up the battlefield.
1:48:2|1:48:10|After the Third Division retreated, [Zhu De] also commanded the cleaning of the battlefield during the war. The trenches were filled with bodies, blood soaking into the soil.
1:48:24|1:48:44|Looking at the battlefield that was already riddled with holes, and at the soldiers who were cleaning up the battlefield with their faces covered in dirt, [Zhu De] fell into contemplation. Finally, he made a difficult and risky decision. By nightfall, under the moonlight at Sanheba, a small team of rebel soldiers were fully armed.
1:48:44|1:48:56|[Zhu De], [Chen Yi], and others are tying hand grenades to themselves. When they are fully equipped, [Zhu De] and other generals take a step back and watch as the young soldiers in front of them salute solemnly.
1:48:56|1:49:19|The scene shifts, and the time is early morning on the third day. Soldiers in full gear emerge from the icy river, their soaked clothes sticking to their bodies. Despite the cold wind causing ripples in the river, these soldiers seem oblivious to the piercing cold, their eyes fixed firmly on their target - the command post of [Qian Dajun] under the flag of the Nationalist Army on the opposite bank.
1:49:19|1:49:25|They cautiously rushed into the tent, but exclaimed in surprise.
1:49:26|1:49:43|When the soldiers were at a loss, a sudden burst of gunfire outside the tent rang out. The next second, bullets pierced through the canvas, mercilessly nailing the soldiers. The 8 brave warriors without cover were instantly swept with bullet holes, their bodies bloody and mangled, lying stiffly on the floor.
1:49:43|1:49:48|The lurking Nationalist Army immediately moved forward and surrounded the command post.
1:49:55|1:50:4|Ultimately died under the gun of [Qian Dajun], it's a pity for the iron-willed warrior who sacrificed his life for righteousness, all his passionate blood turned into a gentle breeze.
1:51:32|1:51:38|The alternating shouts on the battlefield are calling upon every soldier.
1:51:47|1:52:4|[Cai Qingchuan] pushed [Chen Yi] and roared at him to follow the main force to retreat. [Zhu De] looked fearless in front of him, and the passionate soldiers were deeply moved. He took off his military cap, removed the Kuomintang emblem on it, and threw it on the ground fiercely. The soldiers followed suit one after another.
1:52:4|1:52:15|And so, countless Blue Sky White Sun badges were discarded, and a military force that belonged entirely to the Communist Party of China was born at that moment.
1:52:21|1:52:29|[Zhu De] tightly held [Cai Qingchuan]'s hand and said so. Then, with moist eyes, he walked up to the high ground, saluting like the brave warriors marching at the rear.
1:52:30|1:52:42|As [Zhu De] swung his right arm and placed his palm steadily on the side of his temple, the soldiers inside the position all saluted solemnly, including the wounded who couldn't stand and those who had lost their arms.
1:52:42|1:53:4|Countless battle scars, yet the figures standing tall on Sanheba seem particularly upright. From a distance, they look like the Great Wall on the mudflat, incredibly majestic. The battle is about to begin, even the warriors who have experienced bloody battles cannot help but shed tears when facing the separation of life and death. They embrace each other in farewell, releasing their pain.
1:53:4|1:53:22|At the same time, gritting their teeth and waiting for the arrival of [Qian Dajun] with resentment. On one side of the river, soldiers shed unparalleled blood, forging a military spirit with unwavering loyalty. On the other side of the river, the iron-clad cavalry pressed forward, shrouding the clear sky in dust.
1:53:38|1:53:55|The order to defend was about to be announced. The 200 rebel soldiers left behind to hold the line each took ammunition, pulled the fuses, placed bombs all over the position, and finally stepped into the trench, ready to fight to the death, calmly facing the oncoming enemy.
1:53:55|1:54:12|Not long after, the enemy's 32nd Army approached the rebel positions. Faced with tens of thousands of well-equipped troops, not a single one of the 200 soldiers fled the battlefield. They knew they carried the heavy burden of uniting the country, with China's blood and backbone behind them.
1:54:12|1:54:27|Watching the enemy forces continuously surging towards the battlefield, he knew that once the war started, the brutal enemy would charge forward like mad dogs and tear them to pieces.
1:54:27|1:54:38|He knew that no matter what, he and the 200 soldiers would be buried in Sanheba today, but even so, his hands remained steady on the machine gun handle.
1:54:38|1:54:58|At the moment when the enemy troops entered the firing range, he pulled the trigger, and the bullets gushing out of the muzzle seemed to carry the sorrow of Cai Qingchuan losing his comrades and the long-suppressed anger. At this moment, finally, the pent-up emotions found release on the enemy, as 200 soldiers fired in unison, shooting down every enemy daring to invade their position.
1:54:58|1:55:10|When the bullets ran out, he drew the big knife from his back and charged out of the trench to hack at the enemy. When the blade of the knife broke, he swung his fists to knock down the enemy and engage in hand-to-hand combat. If he was shot and unable to move,
1:55:47|1:56:2|He gradually came to his senses and saw Sun Shucheng, who was on the verge of death, constantly gesturing with his hands. Following the direction of his fingers, he saw a detonator.
1:56:7|1:56:20|The soldier named [Liu Song] has lost consciousness, but he is still moving towards the detonator, swaying slowly yet fearlessly and resolutely. When the enemy notices, they immediately raise their guns and shoot Liu Song down.
1:56:20|1:56:36|Witnessing the scene, [Cai Qingchuan] forcefully supported his broken body, disregarding everything as he lunged towards the detonator. After being shot again, he finally lost the strength to stand up, lying down on the ground. With all his might, he shot at the enemies around him and struggled to embrace the detonator into his arms.
1:56:36|1:57:2|He was completely out of strength at this moment, he threw away the pistol, rolled behind the sandbags with the detonator, gritted his teeth, pressed the detonation switch, and the explosives placed in various corners of the position were immediately activated. The explosion started from the central position where [Cai Qingchuan] was located, quickly spreading across the entire battlefield. Countless explosives almost lifted the entire ground, soil and flesh rushing into the air, mixed with debris and sandstone falling heavily.
1:57:2|1:57:20|The huge explosion caused the river to surge, the mountains to shake, and two hundred soldiers to sacrifice heroically. The green hills, the misty haze, the brave warriors buried on the river dam, valiant in a hundred battles, the iron army, tears of blood flowing in all directions for four thousand miles.
1:57:22|1:57:39|On a mountain path, more than 2000 soldiers turned around to look at the Three Gorges Dam position where a deafening explosion was heard. [Zhu De] was in tears, his lips trembling as if wanting to say something, but choked up, he slowly raised his right arm once again towards those sacrificed comrades.
1:57:42|1:58:3|The scene shifts to Sanheba, and after the explosion subsides, [Qian Dajun] finally achieves his goal of occupying the position with his troops. Looking at the scorched earth of Sanheba, the battlefield filled with raging fires and smoke, and the rebel soldiers who, despite wearing Nationalist Army uniforms, are fearless in battle, [Qian Dajun]'s expression becomes solemn.
1:58:3|1:58:23|He didn't know what was supporting [Cai Qingchuan] to swear to live and die with the position, even at the cost of using his body to block the enemy's advance. He couldn't help but wonder if he would be able to do the same if sent to carry out such a mission. Unable to dwell on it, he could only say to his adjutant beside him.
1:58:26|1:58:49|He took off his military cap and threw it into the trench, seemingly regretting the loss of such an iron army in the civil war. As time passed slowly like the cold river water, the scene shifted to Raoping, Guangdong, several days later. [Su Yu] and Peng Yuanhua led a small team of soldiers to Maoshi Village to search for the main force of the army.
1:59:54|2:0:11|Upon hearing this, [Zhu De] and others were somewhat dazed, with [Lin Biao] even twisting his neck. Eventually, unable to hold back, tears streamed down his face. After calming down for a while, he took off [Su Yu]'s military cap and removed the Kuomintang emblem from the top.
2:1:29|2:1:56|While the revolutionary army continued to train and temper themselves in the flames of war, [Jiang Jieshi] in Nanjing felt that the overall situation was already determined. He believed that the members of the Communist Party whom he had once feared were no longer a threat. Therefore, he began to prepare for his wedding with [Song Meiling] early on. As he tidied up his crisp tailcoat, he said.
2:2:55|2:3:3|In the confident back view of [Jiang Jieshi] and [Song Meiling], the scene gradually fades away, arriving at the residence of [Zhou Enlai] who is recuperating in Hong Kong.
2:3:3|2:3:28|After the Nanchang Uprising, [Zhou Enlai] led his troops south to Guangdong. Due to continuous fighting and numerous affairs, he became seriously ill with typhoid fever. He had to move to Hong Kong for treatment. Comrade Fan Guixia, who was responsible for taking care of his daily life, had just cooked the medicinal soup. As soon as she entered the living room, she saw [Zhou Enlai] wearing a coat and burning secret letters. She quickly spoke up.
2:4:46|2:4:52|[Zhu De] led his soldiers to arrive at Jinggangshan.
2:5:0|2:5:9|[He Changgong] excitedly informed everyone of the news, [Mao Zedong] heard it and was extremely excited, leading the soldiers and civilians of Jinggang Mountain to rush to the mountainside to welcome [Zhu De].
2:5:34|2:5:43|Upon finishing speaking, [Mao Zedong]'s expression suddenly turned serious as he looked at the fluttering banners around him and the youthful yet powerful faces.
2:5:48|2:5:57|[Mao Zedong]'s boldness completely infected all the soldiers and civilians present, they cheered and waved flags together, their hearts filled with longing for the future.
2:5:58|2:6:4|Seeing [Su Yu] leading [Lin Biao], Chen Yi, and others saluting to him, [Mao Zedong] spoke.
2:6:8|2:6:20|Having received the affirmation and expectations from [Mao Zedong], everyone was extremely excited. They embraced each other and shouted recklessly. The meeting at Jinggang Mountain greatly struck the arrogant arrogance of the reactionary Kuomintang.
2:6:20|2:6:35|Preserved a large number of steadfast political and military cadres of the Red Army, gathered the essence of armed forces on the Hunan-Jiangxi border, and strengthened the armed forces of the revolutionary base areas, which had extremely profound significance in the history of the Chinese revolution.
2:6:35|2:6:50|The scene gradually fades away in the warm atmosphere after the meeting, and then a line of text gradually appears in the darkness, dedicating this film to the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
