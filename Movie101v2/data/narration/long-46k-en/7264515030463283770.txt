0:0:34|0:0:41|The film begins with people orderly checking tickets and entering the circus venue, where the audience is constantly coming and going, creating a lively atmosphere.
0:0:43|0:1:0|After the audience took their seats, Changfu Circus began the show with a lively welcome ceremony, as two large flags were unfurled to kick off the performance. Following that, two lion dancers appeared on stage, their heads, limbs, and bodies moving agilely, galloping powerfully and leaping lightly.
0:1:0|0:1:19|On the side of the stage, several people are performing somersaults, with a set of movements that flow like water, very beautiful. Later, the ancient horn team came on stage, holding small horns while walking and blowing, circling the stage once to surround it. Following them were four children who performed a Diabolo acrobatics routine for everyone.
0:1:19|0:1:27|The acrobat at the bottom effortlessly lifts the three people and circles the field, very impressive. The atmosphere in the venue is cheerful, and the whole warm-up event is very lively.
0:1:28|0:1:33|Behind the scenes, [Han] lifts the curtain and walks out of the dressing room, looking around as if searching for someone.
0:1:51|0:1:59|After [Xiao Ding] left, his father [Master Shen] also put his hat back on, and the serious expression on his face was replaced with a smile.
0:1:59|0:2:13|After that, the aerial rope act began, with [Chiang Yitien] emerging from backstage with great enthusiasm, taking the lead by grabbing the rope, followed closely by the other two. The three of them quickly performed somersaults in the air, moving at such a speed that it resembled spinning tires in motion.
0:2:14|0:2:28|They then began to do the splits, with their legs constantly changing positions between the ropes, performing a variety of dazzling movements comparable to today's gymnasts on the rings. The ropes wrapped more and more around their wrists, lifting them further and further from the ground.
0:2:28|0:2:34|At this moment, [Chiang Yitien] suddenly let the rope out, and the audience below thought he was going to fall, all of them gasping in shock.
0:2:47|0:3:0|Backstage, [Han] in clown makeup, discreetly slipped some money to [Xiao Mei]. Meanwhile, on stage, [Lung] and his partner were performing a duo aerial act. His partner held onto the swing frame with their left hand and pulled [Lung] with their right hand.
0:3:0|0:3:17|[Xiao Ding] is spinning in the air, performing high-difficulty moves such as a one-handed handstand and a hanging hook. The performance is not only spectacular but also dreamlike. The audience is deeply moved by this amazing performance, and applause fills the air for a moment. The show at the racecourse is also in full swing.
0:3:17|0:3:31|Two actors are performing acrobatics on horseback, with [Han] in the middle of the stage holding a whip to drive the horse. At this moment, the actress with a high ponytail, [Xiao Lan], rushes in from the outside wanting to get on the horse. However, both of them ignore her, leaving her frustrated as she pushes to the side and angrily swings her arms.
0:3:34|0:3:47|While resting on the bed, [Han] walked out of the field, wiping the sweat off his hands and adjusting his clothes for better ventilation. He sat down next to the tent, where his lover [Xiao Mei] looked at him helplessly.
0:4:22|0:4:39|[Xiao Ding] took the clown nose from [Xiao Mei]'s hand and turned back to the stage. She walked to the center of the stage with a funny gait, choosing the act she wanted to perform. She went through the iron wire to the swing performance area, pretending to be hit by the swing on purpose. The performance in gray shoes made the audience burst into laughter.
0:4:39|0:4:49|She then grabbed the swing board, wrapped herself around it, and swung back and forth. Unexpectedly, the next second, she flipped directly onto the board, performing a 360-degree rotation with the swing.
0:4:51|0:5:4|The swing kept spinning in the air, and as it descended on its final rotation, Han was thrown out by the person behind him. He thought he would fall to the ground, but unexpectedly he was caught by the person performing the reverse hanging hook on the opposite side. The three of them experienced a sweaty fall in the air.
0:5:5|0:5:21|A series of performances were truly exciting, leaving the audience wanting more. Next up was a children's acrobatics show, where [Xiao Lan] balanced five bamboo stools on her hands, feet, and forehead, while three other [Xiao Lan] were busy crawling through hoops.
0:5:21|0:5:34|As the performance progresses, [Xiao Lan] performs tasks such as flipping and bending over while balancing on a bamboo platform. Meanwhile, two of the other [children] take turns lifting each other up inside a cylinder with their backs against each other, while the third one stands and bends their leg over their head.
0:5:36|0:5:47|Following is the bamboo pole performance. Six men, divided into three groups, balance on two poles. Their movements are synchronized, as if copied and pasted, even the youngest man can complete it smoothly.
0:5:49|0:5:58|The audience cheered continuously, then everyone stepped back, leaving [Chiang Yitien] alone to climb up the pole. With just the strength of his arms, he climbed to the very top using only his hands.
0:5:58|0:6:8|He then leaped onto another pole, jumping back and forth between the two poles. Finally, he slid down the pole headfirst and took a bow with his companions to end the performance.
0:6:10|0:6:23|[Xiao Ding] played a child with a blank expression. After everyone stepped back, he walked onto the stage in a daze, looking around, and then made a big leap forward.
0:6:45|0:6:53|Only [Chiang Yitien] was fighting two opponents, agile and powerful, catching them off guard with every punch.
0:7:19|0:7:31|After returning the money, [Shen Tinyi] gave [Chiang Yitien] a glare and then left coldly. In the afternoon, [Shen Tinyi] and [Xiao Ding] returned to the inner courtyard again. They performed the magic flying knives.
0:7:31|0:7:45|[Xiao Ding] strapped himself onto the disc, and [Shen Tinyi] started spinning it. Standing at a distance, [Shen Tinyi] threw throwing knives at the disc, and the knives seemed to have eyes as they perfectly avoided [Xiao Ding]. The audience was on edge, holding their breath.
0:7:46|0:8:1|After seeing the person not shooting, the audience erupted into applause. Before the three finished their performance and caught their breath, [Han] dealt with the matter in a different place.
0:8:22|0:8:27|[Shen Tinyi] is putting on the costume of a skydiver in front of the mirror, and [Xiao Ding] walks in quickly to persuade him.
0:8:40|0:8:57|However, [Shen Tinyi] was still somewhat worried. The aerial acrobatics finally began after many setbacks. [Chiang Yitien] appeared in a cloak, shining as he unveiled the curtain. The audience had been eagerly anticipating this moment, and the scene was filled with cheers and laughter. He remained calm and composed, showing no signs of panic.
0:8:57|0:9:4|[Chiang Yitien] stands up and excitedly spreads his arms to salute the audience. He then grabs the horizontal bar and swings forward with force.
0:9:5|0:9:19|Suddenly, a shell dropped from the sky and exploded in front of him. Han fell from the crossbar, but luckily he reacted quickly and caught the safety rope in time. However, the bomber continued to drop shells, turning the circus into a sea of fire in an instant.
0:9:20|0:9:38|The audience fled the circus in a panic, those who couldn't escape were blown away by the shells. What should have been a place filled with laughter was instantly filled with screams. The circus turned into a sea of fire in an instant, with mushroom clouds rising above. [Master Shen] protected his daughter and apprentice as they ran out of the circus.
0:10:11|0:10:13|Everyone split the money and went their separate ways.
0:10:46|0:10:52|Yitien glanced at Chiang Yitien, turned away and didn't want to take the money, but Chiang Yitien still stuffed the money into his pocket.
0:11:28|0:11:47|After bidding farewell to his companions, Han left without hesitation. The sound of war echoed through the sky, as the Japanese occupied the three provinces in the east and established the puppet state of Manchukuo. They ravaged and plundered across China, causing great suffering. The scene shifted to the docks, where the crowds were dense and everyone was trying to escape by any means possible.
0:11:47|0:11:57|Master Shen's family is also here. He walks in the middle protecting Xiao Ding and Captain Ding, with Yitien and Xiao Mei leading the way. The five of them are being pushed forward by the crowd, facing great difficulties.
0:12:34|0:12:39|Soon, [Han] led everyone to the side of the ship and pointed to the window, saying.
0:12:41|0:12:59|Leading the way, [Han] rolled up the hem of his long robe and secured it around his waist with a belt. He then stepped onto the fixed rope of the boat, using the skill of tightrope walking to slowly make his way to the deck. At the same time, three children, [Xiao Lan], [Captain Tang], and [Xiao Mei], rolled over with barrels, picked up wooden planks, and created a makeshift springboard.
0:12:59|0:13:11|At this moment, the sailor is watching the crowd boarding the ship ahead, so [Master Shen] is temporarily safe here. [Yitien] walks cautiously and finally boards the ship safely, then hurriedly catches the luggage thrown up by [Yixi].
0:13:11|0:13:25|Following that, [Han] lifted [Xiao Lan], and with a strong jump, [Xiao Lan] was propelled onto the boat. Following this method, soon, all three children successfully boarded the boat. Big sister [Xiao Mei] used the same method.
0:13:27|0:13:38|Next up is [Master Shen]. One day, a rope was thrown down from the ship, and [Master Shen] pulled himself up to the deck like rock climbing. Ding Ju followed closely behind.
0:13:42|0:13:48|[Ding Lan] was about to go up, but was stopped by the arriving sailor. Just as he was about to be taken away, [Chiang Yitien] arrived.
0:13:56|0:14:10|Chiang Yitien raised his sword and took a step, holding a bamboo pole with both hands. Xiao Lan stepped on his leg and climbed up the pole. When she reached a certain height, Chiang Yitien tilted the pole towards the boat. Xiao Lan flipped and leaped onto the boat. Once she stood firm, she quickly signaled to Chiang Yitien.
0:14:10|0:14:24|[Chiang Yitien] dropped the bamboo pole, extended two spring ropes from his sleeves, and fixed them on the railing with a flick. He then exerted force to pivot, causing the ropes to naturally retract forward. [Chiang Yitien] was pulled onto the boat by the ropes, and he joyfully reunited with everyone after retracting the ropes.
0:14:32|0:14:49|[Master Shen] helplessly looked at [Chiang Yitien], who lowered his head guiltily and dared not meet the master's gaze. The sound of the whistle rang out as the ship slowly started moving.
0:14:49|0:14:52|[Chiang Yitien] carefully supports [Xiao Lan] and helps him carry the luggage.
0:15:4|0:15:11|[Chiang Yitien] dropped his luggage and charged forward like a released arrow, with [Xiao Lan] closely following behind.
0:15:11|0:15:21|But before [Chiang Yitien] could arrive, Captain Tang flew out of the tent and kicked the thief in the face, causing the thief to fall straight back.
0:15:25|0:15:38|The thief took the opportunity to escape quickly, [Captain Tang] hurriedly stood up to chase, accidentally bumping into [Xiao Lan] who came over. [Xiao Lan] was captivated by his handsome face, and [Captain Tang] also turned back to take another look at him.
0:15:38|0:15:43|On the other side, [Chiang Yitien] took a shortcut and caught up with the thief, diving onto the thief's neck.
0:15:48|0:16:7|[Chiang Yitien] is in pain, clutching his wound and rolling on the ground. At this moment, [Captain Tang] arrives and kicks the thief down. [Captain Tang] orders his men to beat the thief severely, prompting [Chiang Yitien] to quickly get up and intervene.
0:16:7|0:16:17|Captain Tang ignored him and, coincidentally, the police arrived and shot the thief dead. Chiang Yitien, frightened, hid behind a tree and his men found something in the thief's pocket and handed it to Captain Tang.
0:18:8|0:18:10|Ma Li walked out of the warehouse and asked.
0:19:5|0:19:16|[Chiang Yitien] was kicked by Mary and unwilling to accept it, then turned around and started fighting with her. Mary showed no fear of him, and for a moment, it was hard to tell who had the upper hand. Just as [Chiang Yitien] was about to make his next move, an old man unexpectedly shouted.
0:20:29|0:20:32|Master Shen and his team found a dilapidated house and were working on repairing it.
0:20:57|0:21:9|[Ding] sat aside, not wanting to pay attention all day. When they returned, he gave [Chiang Yitien] another reminder.
0:22:46|0:22:58|[Chiang Yitien] heard his master calling him and instantly became at a loss. He turned back slowly, only to see his master shaking his head at him. The scene then shifted to the street, where [Xiao Lan], [Xiao Mei], and three young disciples were huddled together whispering.
0:23:48|0:23:58|Who knew the children were not interested in this program and left one after another. [Chiang Yitien] was about to perform, but turned around to find no one there.
0:24:0|0:24:25|[Ding Lan] on this side, the situation is quite the opposite, their handsome martial arts skills and exciting acrobatic performances attract many onlookers. After speaking, [Captain Tang] and [Ding Lan] both performed their special skills, the youngest [Xiao Lan] went to ask for money with a bowl, and everyone was quite generous, giving a lot.
0:24:30|0:24:46|One day, [Chiang Yitien] squeezed into the crowd, only to see [Xiao Ding] and his three apprentices performing their acrobatics skillfully. [Xiao Lan]'s acrobatic performance was thrilling, and the audience applauded and cheered. [Xiao Mei] saw the two of them and exchanged a proud look.
0:24:46|0:24:56|The two smiled at each other and joined the audience in applauding. Suddenly, someone played a trick and threw a string of firecrackers into the crowd, causing the acrobatic little girl [Ding Lan] lifted by Xiao Lan to be frightened and fall down.
0:25:29|0:25:33|After seeing Xiao Lan and Xiao Ju leave, Han turned to Shen Tinyi and said.
0:25:35|0:25:48|[Shen Tinyi] shook his head and stepped back. Meanwhile, [Han] tossed the money in his hand up and knocked them down one by one while his brother wasn't paying attention. [Shen Tinyi] caught the money in his pocket.
0:26:4|0:26:10|The sound of fighting attracted Captain Tang, causing Han to flee in a panic, while Lung continued to beat them up without knowing.
0:27:30|0:27:44|Captain Tang walked up to Xiao Lan and looked at her. Xiao Lan turned around and saw him too. Their eyes briefly met and quickly separated. Captain Tang didn't leave until Xiao Lan was out of sight. The camera then moved to a boat.
0:29:50|0:30:8|In order to earn more money to reorganize the circus, Han came to the recruitment factory. He squatted by the factory wall waiting for work, his mind couldn't help but recall the performance of "The Aerialist" that was terminated by gunfire. His face was full of sadness, sighing with melancholy. How he longed to return to the circus and continue his acrobatic dream.
0:30:8|0:30:19|The voice from the side interrupted his reminiscence. Before he knew it, a crowd had gathered at the door. Li Dong quickly stood up, looking puzzled at everyone. It turned out that the workers from the recruitment factory had come out.
0:30:20|0:30:33|They looked at the poster of today's unsuccessful operation on the wall, the crowd dispersed in an uproar. Yitien stepped forward to carefully examine the poster, sighed in frustration, and was about to leave with his hands in his pockets when he was stopped by a man in a yellow carriage.
0:31:19|0:31:34|Yitien surveyed the surroundings and finally chose a large tree right next to the police station window. With agile movements, he climbed up the tree trunk. Despite it being a towering tree, he quickly reached the top and then made a turn, jumping safely onto the window ledge.
0:31:34|0:31:40|[Lung] saw that he had arrived, immediately showing a triumphant smile, while Yitien foolishly ran to the other side to greet them.
0:31:42|0:31:55|[Lung] and his men climbed onto the windowsill, sneaking into the interior of the police station. [Lung] took the lead and approached a door, looking inside before turning to Yitien and saying.
0:31:55|0:32:11|Han and the others arrived at the detention room, Han knocked on the door, and the person inside rushed over upon hearing the sound. Han turned around and pressed him against the wall. Lung reminded him, Han took the key and rushed inside, only to find out.
0:32:17|0:32:33|Yitien was surrounded and blocked by a group of police officers, with no way to escape, as Han opened the door to the next room where a group of police officers were playing cards. Lung and his men had already hurriedly taken people to escape.
0:32:33|0:32:40|Unable to do anything else, he started fighting with the police. Captain Tang couldn't catch up, so he went downstairs to block Chiang Yitien and glanced at him to make a judgment.
0:32:55|0:33:6|[Chiang Yitien] ran away while anxiously trying to explain, but [Captain Tang] didn't want to talk to him. The two of them went down the stairs from the first floor, evenly matched, and for a moment, it was hard to tell who would win.
0:33:6|0:33:19|At this moment, [Chiang Yitien] grabbed the handrail of the stairs on the second floor, attempting to escape. Captain Tang reacted quickly and caught up immediately. Just when [Chiang Yitien] thought he was about to succeed, two guns were pointed at his chest, and Captain Tang nodded.
0:33:24|0:33:28|Soon, [Shen Tinyi] and [Xiao Ding] were called to the police station.
0:34:4|0:34:13|[Shen Tinyi] immediately accompanied Xiao to sign, while at this moment, three children, one from the south, one from the west, and one from the north, holding hands and wanting to board the flower boat to play, were stopped by the guards.
0:34:32|0:34:40|Three children were getting ready to board the ship, and [Xiao Ding] also arrived here, looking around as if searching for something. At this moment, [Captain Tang] patted him on the shoulder.
0:34:51|0:35:15|Speak up, [Han] is searching again. At this moment, the innkeeper noticed the three of them and shouted. [Xiao Lan] provided cover for them. Upon hearing this, [Captain Tang] immediately jumped off the bridge to chase after them.
0:35:21|0:35:28|Captain Tang mentioned the righteousness and shook it, the righteous man turned back to try to save the righteousness. Captain Tang then caught up with Yitien, who was running at the back.
0:36:50|0:37:2|[Master Shen] and his family started eating, with Master Shen coughing continuously at the dining table. [Mei Ding] still looked worried, while [Xiao Dong] brought a teacup to Master Shen.
0:38:15|0:38:23|[Master Shen] finished speaking and then brought one person from the south and one person from the north onto the ship. When the crew on the ship saw them, they asked.
0:38:29|0:38:37|Master Shen nodded to his assistant in gratitude, and then led three children into the cabin. The assistant shouted inside, "Boss, someone is looking for you, please come in."
0:38:40|0:38:57|Master Shen continued to walk in, and [Madame Boss] came out to open the door. When she saw Master Shen, her eyes widened, and Master Shen, upon seeing her, had a smile frozen on his face. It turned out that these two were former partners of the Magic Flying Knife, they were senior brothers in the circus, had known each other for a long time, and could be considered old acquaintances.
0:38:57|0:38:59|[The landlady] smiled faintly and spoke first.
0:40:9|0:40:11|Jumping around all day, very mischievous.
0:40:56|0:41:10|[The landlady] finished speaking and walked towards the door, while Master Shen's family's gaze remained on her. Soon, Master Shen was the first to come back to his senses and said to the children. Then, he looked embarrassed.
0:41:13|0:41:17|[Xiao Ding] and Chiang Yitien looked mischievous.
0:43:13|0:43:21|The landlady arranged a big house for Master Shen's family. At this moment, Chiang Yitien looked at the landlady going upstairs and sighed.
0:43:27|0:43:31|Xiao Lan looked at the back of Chiang Yitien, her expression unclear as she thought about something.
0:43:57|0:43:59|[Shen Tinyi] put the wooden pillow back on the bed.
0:44:27|0:44:29|The scene shifts to the office of Zhang's factory.
0:45:59|0:46:15|With the help of the landlady, the three apprentices finally found a job. They walked out of the factory manager's office happily, ready to start working. Although the work was not easy, they always had smiles on their faces, not complaining about the unfairness of life, but instead feeling grateful. One day, the master who was cutting something seemed a bit worried.
0:46:23|0:46:43|Suddenly, a group of police officers burst in and shouted at everyone inside. Everyone stopped what they were doing and stood still, as Captain Tang came down to inquire.
0:47:6|0:47:25|Several workers got into a fight with the police out of anger, and ended up being beaten up. They were left on the side, and [Shen Tinyi] helped them up, speaking out with righteousness. Standing on the side, [Captain Tang] gestured with his hand for them not to speak out.
0:47:25|0:47:29|[Master Shen] and his group looked at the police indignantly, saying that this was a matter of principle.
0:47:37|0:47:44|[Master Shen], Han, Xiao Lan, and Captain Tang looked at each other helplessly upon hearing the words. At that moment, three children were playing on the street.
0:48:1|0:48:5|Once again out of work, [Master Shen] looked worried and hesitant, keeping to himself and not daring to approach.
0:49:31|0:49:37|The next day the factory resumed operation, with Han wearing the foreman's clothes and ringing a bell to address everyone.
0:50:22|0:50:35|A familiar voice entered Yidong's ears, and he looked towards it, only to see [Lung]. He slammed down his chopsticks, his expression full of resentment. [Master Shen] and Yitian, unaware of what had happened, looked at him in confusion.
0:50:38|0:50:48|[Lung] and Uncle Seven were chatting and laughing in the courtyard, but the sound was extremely grating to Han. Afraid that his master would worry, he kept stuffing food into his mouth until he couldn't fit any more in.
0:51:8|0:51:14|Master Shen took Yitien to settle accounts at the factory. Yitien kicked open the door of the factory director's office and rushed in.
0:51:46|0:51:53|After a round of persuasion, [Lung] couldn't bear the pressure and was about to be taken to the police station by Yi Dong. However, he suddenly brightened up when he saw someone approaching at the door.
0:52:0|0:52:12|[Lung] Wu saw the savior and immediately perked up. He exerted himself to open a door and hid behind [Lung] Wei.
0:52:18|0:52:22|Master Shen angrily walked out of the scene in his apron, and [Xiao Ding] quickly followed after him.
0:52:34|0:52:38|[Xiao Ding] sent Yitien and the others out with a worried look on his face, while Master Shen coughed violently in the night.
0:54:37|0:54:43|The landlady left with a happy face, just as Captain Tang was feeling pleased, Lung suddenly appeared.
0:55:5|0:55:21|[Ding Ju] heard the words and quickly ran back to see what they were up to. He took his junior martial siblings to run to Master Shen's room. He blew out the candle, made sure Master Shen was already asleep, and excitedly said to Han and Lung.
0:55:29|0:55:39|Just as the arrangements were made, [Lung] and his group began knocking on the door. A rubber band was placed on the door by one person from the south and one from the west. The door was instantly knocked open by [Lung], and he fell backwards in a somersault.
0:55:41|0:56:1|The two of them were amused by his awkward appearance, when suddenly, henchmen cut the rubber rope and rushed in. [Han] and [Xiao Lan] quickly climbed the stairs to prepare for the next trap. Those who were not knocked down continued to charge forward, while [Lung] alone arrived at a house, where [Xiao Mei] had long been lying in ambush under the bed.
0:56:1|0:56:8|He used a rope to tie up Lung's feet, causing him to fall to the ground instantly. Han kicked him in frustration and ran out laughing.
0:56:10|0:56:25|[Ding Juxi] and [Yi Bei] set up another mechanism in the room. At this moment, a group of people chased after [Yi Nan], who climbed onto the horizontal bar and used the swinging force to kick hard on the chests of several people. The men were not convinced and ended up being beaten again.
0:56:33|0:56:47|[Yixi] climbed onto the stone railing of the balcony, [Lung] Lung tried to grab him, but [Yixi] dodged with a leap. He then grabbed the hanging cloth rope, wrapped it around his arm, and swung down to kick [Lung] Lung's face hard. As [Lung] Lung tried to get up and chase after him, [Yixi] had already disappeared without a trace.
0:56:49|0:57:2|Han is not done yet, as he swiftly jumps between the bamboo poles while his men clumsily try to chase after him below. Unable to catch Han, they angrily chop down the poles until Han jumps to the other side gracefully and taunts them.
0:57:9|0:57:30|This group of people, unwilling to give up, continued to chase, unaware that a trap set by the surveillance team was waiting for them. Suddenly, [Shen Tinyi], one from the south, one from the west, and one from the north, emerged from the shadows and started punching and kicking at them. After the attack, they disappeared back into the shadows, leaving the group stunned and clueless about who had just attacked them.
0:57:39|0:57:57|[Xiao Ding] and a few others surrounded [Lung Wu], igniting a rocket launcher. Sparks exploded at their feet, and they dodged the sparks like a tap dance. Unable to withstand it any longer and wanting to escape, [Xiao Ding] decided not to let this group off so easily. He led everyone to drill out of the circle and block their way, leaving [Lung Wu] in a tough spot.
0:58:8|0:58:13|[Xiao Ding] stuffed them all into the rocket barrel, with a wicked smile on his face, ready to light the fuse.
1:0:4|1:0:20|Yitien heard the words of his master, feeling guilty and unsure whether to leave or stay. He looked at [Xiao Lan], memories flooding back of the days when they rehearsed circus acts together. Back then, he was so full of spirit, and the coordination between him and [Xiao Lan] was so seamless.
1:0:21|1:0:36|Now, she has not completed a formal aerial acrobatics performance. She doesn't want to give up, [Chiang Yitien] decides to stay and reorganize the circus together. She puts down her luggage, dispelling the thought of leaving. In the room, [Xiao Mei] sits on the bed with a worried look on her face.
1:1:34|1:1:41|[Xiao Ding] covered himself with a blanket, sighed helplessly, and the scene shifted to the factory.
1:2:14|1:2:26|Despite this, [Chiang Yitien] began the experiment without hesitation. He lit the cigarette with the candlestick on the table, exhaled a puff of smoke, and his face started to contort. However, [Chiang Yitien] still managed to swallow that breath.
1:2:26|1:2:29|The next morning, [Han] said to [Chiang Yitien].
1:2:53|1:2:58|A luxury car drove into the recruitment factory, and the workers opened the door for them, nodding and bowing in question.
1:3:2|1:3:16|Just as the gate was about to close, [Han] rushed over. He squeezed through the gate and began his experiment again. Smoke filled the laboratory, and at that moment, someone started coughing violently. [Han] quickly ordered his subordinates.
1:3:21|1:3:33|[Xiao Mei] continued to persevere with a pained expression, but her hard work finally paid off as she bought the dressing table that [Xiao Ding] had always dreamed of. She joyfully and proudly moved forward with the dressing table on her back, taking small steps.
1:3:46|1:3:50|After speaking, [Xiao Mei] turned around. At this moment, [Ding Lan] walked over and handed her a letter.
1:3:56|1:4:9|[Xiao Mei] caught it with her mouth, then carried the dressing table into the room. She set up the dressing table and carefully wiped the mirror. After finishing her work, [Xiao Mei] sat down and opened the letter to read.
1:4:17|1:4:30|Xiao Mei's expression became panicked, tears welled up in her eyes. Over here, Han led everyone to the street to find Xiao Mei, they walked around cluelessly. At this moment, Han stopped in his tracks, lost in thought.
1:4:41|1:4:45|[Xiao Ding] left alone after giving instructions.
1:4:47|1:4:57|[Xiao Ding] wanted to go to the police station to ask for help from [Captain Tang]. When he arrived at the entrance, the passing police officers slowed his steps, but he mustered up the courage to walk through the gate in the end.
1:5:42|1:5:55|After speaking, [Captain Tang] immediately went to make arrangements. Meanwhile, [Chiang Yitien] walked alone on the street, hands in pockets with a worried look on his face. As he passed by a factory, he happened to see a person covered in white cloth being pushed out, with the person pushing the cart complaining as they walked.
1:6:3|1:6:18|[Chiang Yitien] felt something was wrong and wanted to investigate, but the door was locked. He glanced at the surrounding wall and decisively climbed up. After entering the gate, he crawled into the factory through the passage used for transporting goods. He carefully observed his surroundings first to ensure safety before climbing down.
1:6:18|1:6:24|He then lifted a bag onto his head, pretending to be a worker here, and quietly walked inside.
1:6:28|1:6:41|After entering a room and hiding behind the door, [Chiang Yitien] came out and opened the boxes stacked here. Inside, various types of firearms were neatly arranged, while another box was filled with grenades.
1:6:41|1:6:47|[Chiang Yitien] was shocked and felt that there must be other secrets in this factory, so he quickly closed the box and walked out.
1:6:49|1:7:3|Next, [Chiang Yitien] entered a room divided into compartments. He gently pushed the door open a crack and saw a foreigner conducting experiments with a retort. The retort was filled with an unknown liquid, giving off a very eerie vibe.
1:7:3|1:7:5|[Chiang Yitien] closes the door and continues walking inside.
1:7:6|1:7:14|There was a secret door in the room, and [Chiang Yitien] wanted to investigate it, but someone walked in. [Chiang Yitien] pretended to be casual and greeted him, but he still noticed something was amiss.
1:7:20|1:7:34|Suddenly, the people around wielded knives and axes towards [Chiang Yitien], who was surrounded by them. I was in charge, and for a moment the situation was quite passive. At this moment, he saw a crane used to transport things above his head, and he became suspicious.
1:7:34|1:7:40|He first swept through, clearing the surrounding enemies, then made a strong leap, grabbing onto the crane and lying on top of it.
1:7:44|1:8:1|Yitien moved too fast, the people below hadn't reacted yet. The group of people crazily rushed towards the crane rope, pulling the crane that was moving forward to a standstill. Yitien jumped onto a large rack again, grabbed the rope he came on, and successfully escaped.
1:8:1|1:8:6|At this moment, Captain Tang joyfully called Xiao Ding to the prosecutor's office.
1:8:26|1:8:36|Han is searching for the boss's transmitter. At that time, Captain Tang is leading Master Shen's family over here. His men saw it and informed Han.
1:8:41|1:8:59|Master Shen and Xiao Lan entered the boat, only to be shocked by the scene in front of them. Xiao Lan hurried in to take a look. They saw Mary holding the boss lady hostage, Lung holding Xiao Lan, walking out of the cabin, and angrily said.
1:9:11|1:9:27|At this moment, Captain Tang quickly went around to the back door, caught Lung off guard, and the two of them hurried to deal with the situation, releasing the boss lady and Xiao Ding. The boss lady saw Master Shen and shook her head in gratitude. Captain Tang was then surrounded by several people, but he managed to subdue them all with his strength.
1:9:30|1:9:43|[Mary] and [Chiang Yitien] engage in a one-on-one fight, moving from the cabin to the deck. [Chiang Yitien]'s martial arts are agile, countering each move skillfully. Although [Mary] can defend herself, she appears to be at a disadvantage and gradually falls behind.
1:9:43|1:9:49|Facing three opponents, they were no match for her at all. With a swift kick, she easily knocked them to the ground.
1:9:50|1:10:5|Captain Tang's situation is even more optimistic here. Lung is like a wooden dummy in front of him, easily beaten to a pulp without much effort, getting hit all over. Xiao Lan is gradually at a disadvantage, and his strong men immediately rush to protect him.
1:10:7|1:10:22|Several henchmen responded, although [Chiang Yitien] was highly skilled in martial arts, but facing a large number of enemies, it was a bit difficult to fight. Just as [Han] had just dealt with one wave, another wave came. He agilely dodged, took advantage of the enemies' unpreparedness, jumped onto the table, stepped on their hands with one foot, and then added two more rounds.
1:10:23|1:10:42|Yidong was in chaos here, amidst flashes of blades and shadows, he and the enemy's figures intertwined at high speed. The enemies kept coming one after another, Yidong grabbed the rope and swung to the second floor window, gaining the advantage of terrain, he became even more at ease. One by one, his subordinates were dealt with by him, forcing Xiao Lan to personally fight him.
1:10:42|1:10:59|The two of them moved like lightning, with their techniques changing rapidly, but it was clear that Han had the upper hand. On the other side of the boat, Han lured the enemy to the corner, where Xiao Ding had already ambushed them. With a sweeping kick, Xiao Ding knocked the enemy to the ground, and he proudly peeked out to take a look.
1:10:59|1:11:11|[Ding Lan] was about to leave when he saw three people coming in from outside. He skillfully used a set of left and right hooks, plus a back kick, and the three people were instantly knocked to the ground. Even though Yixi was young, he also subdued one of the enemies.
1:11:13|1:11:29|On the other side, [Lung] was heavily slammed against the railing, with no chance to catch his breath by [Captain Tang]. He quickly stepped forward and delivered another punch, sending the opponent spinning in the air before crashing straight to the ground. In a panic, [Lung] tried to escape, disregarding his dignity as he crawled forward quickly.
1:11:29|1:11:40|[Captain Tang] caught up, but was caught by the police officers, so he had to deal with the enemies first. Han was still fighting with Chiang Yitien, who pushed him to the railing. However, Han was not discouraged and instead jumped onto the mast of the ship.
1:11:41|1:11:58|Yitien immediately reacted, grabbing the rope at the mast and continuing to struggle with him. Lung was chased by Captain Tang with no way out, and jumped into the river with a brave face. Mary saw the situation was lost, slid down the mast trying to retreat, but Yitien was one step ahead and caught her. She was still trying to break free, hoping to escape.
1:11:58|1:12:21|Captain Tang rushed to help when he saw the situation, completely suppressing her. Yitien breathed a sigh of relief, while Mary looked unwilling. Captain Tang and Master Shen helped the boss lady out of the cabin. The scene shifted to the factory, where Yitien was still conducting experiments. However, his face no longer showed pain, and he seemed to enjoy taking a puff of the cigarette.
1:12:21|1:12:23|On the other side, Captain Tang sent Xiao Ding home.
1:12:34|1:12:41|In the midst of their conversation, the two stopped in their tracks and saw Han sleeping soundly against the wall. Captain Tang said to Xiao Lan.
1:12:51|1:13:1|After waking up, Han got up and chased after her. After speaking, Han walked towards [Xiao Lan] with a rough look on his face. [Xiao Lan] leaned against the wall, looking at him carefully.
1:14:28|1:14:33|Han slowly walked to Chiang Yitien's side and squatted down, comforting him in a soft voice.
1:14:56|1:15:1|At the end of the day, [Han] collapsed here and fell asleep. At this moment, the police station is in a state of crisis.
1:15:21|1:15:27|Captain Tang looked around as he entered, with Lung and Owen both turning to him. He paused for a moment, then saluted the chief.
1:16:16|1:16:25|Both of you calm down for now. If you don't release the person, you will be responsible for all consequences. Without explaining, [Captain Tang] turned around and left.
1:16:31|1:16:33|Captain Tang's expression turned serious after listening.
1:16:34|1:16:52|The scene shifts to the laboratory, where the chain-smoking [Chiang Yitien] stealthily reaches for a cigarette on the neighboring table. Suddenly, a hand grabs him and roars in anger. [Chiang Yitien]'s hand is forcefully twisted behind his back, and shortly after, he is thrown out by someone.
1:16:52|1:17:2|[Chiang Yitien], who was kicked out of the laboratory, leaned on the railing in despair. The scene then shifts to the office, where Mary is choosing cigarettes. She picks two and hands them to [Han]. After smelling them, [Han] says to Captain Tang.
1:17:20|1:17:30|[Chiang Yitien], who was kicked out, is still not giving up. He sneaks back into the lab to look for cigarettes when no one is around. Despite never having done anything wrong, he is unusually cautious and observes the entrance for a while before rushing in.
1:17:31|1:17:52|He sneaked in quietly, looked on the table and then bent down to search the empty cigarette case under the table. His movements were reckless, the former gentleness was gone. He finally found one. Before he could put it in his mouth, the door opened and a group of people walked in and saw him. They started punching and talking.
1:17:56|1:18:18|After Lung found out, he kicked heavily, the sound alarming Mary. He pulled back the curtain to check, and Han asked. After being beaten by Lung and his gang all day, Mary calmly opened the window and shouted.
1:18:24|1:18:44|One day, he was dragged out of the factory by two henchmen. He fell heavily on the iron cart at the door, struggling to get up but too injured. He rolled down the cart and fainted on the ground. At home, [Shen Tinyi] walked into the room to greet everyone.
1:19:23|1:19:28|One day, reminiscing about the days when he used to play the clown in the circus.
1:20:5|1:20:23|Shen Tinyi sat at the table with a worried look on his face, while Xiao Ding paced outside the window for a while before walking in with heavy steps. Xiao Ding hesitated to speak, shook his head with a serious expression, and Shen Tinyi already understood in his heart.
1:20:25|1:20:30|[Xiao Mei] pushed open the door excitedly, but the heavy atmosphere in the room made her feel uneasy.
1:20:32|1:20:45|He suddenly realized, looked up at the building, took three steps and sat down two steps up, anxiously asking [Xiao Lan]. Xiao Lan glanced at him, did not answer, and Xiao Mei quickly ran towards the room.
1:20:45|1:20:55|One day, memories of the circus days flashed through his mind like a carousel. Back then, the clown would lie on the ground playing dead, only to get up with a laugh after the joke. But this time, the joke became reality.
1:21:4|1:21:21|The quiet night was broken by a mournful erhu sound, and the day finally couldn't make it through, passing away in the arms of [Xiao Mei]. Master Shen played the erhu with a sorrowful expression, looking up at the sky with sadness in his eyes. After a while, he closed his eyes, seemingly reminiscing about the bits and pieces of the day.
1:21:22|1:21:34|At the table, Han was full of spirit, while lying on the bed, she looked pale and lifeless. [Xiao Mei] was burning paper money next to the stove, tears streaming down her face, using her crying to suppress the pain in her heart.
1:21:36|1:21:49|Suddenly, Han stood up with a look of anger on his face, and the others also responded one after another. Captain Tang put down the erhu and led the group out of the house with a strong momentum. They looked determined, without a trace of fear.
1:21:49|1:21:59|Captain Tang and dozens of police officers quietly caught up, but stopped at the corner. At this moment, a police officer wanted to continue chasing forward, but was stopped by Captain Tang. He asked in confusion.
1:22:8|1:22:13|Captain Tang picked up the praise from the team members and lowered his head in thought, then the scene shifted to the landlady.
1:22:27|1:22:42|The landlady had a determined look in her eyes. At this moment, Master Shen's family had already arrived at the tobacco factory. One person went in from the south and one from the west, opening the lock on the gate. The rest of the group entered through this gate in broad daylight. Ding Mei walked at the front, with a resolute gaze, determined to avenge her husband.
1:22:42|1:22:53|At the same time, the landlady is having people tie all sorts of explosives to the boat, which is of no importance to her. Right now, all she wants to do is to help her senior brother's family seek revenge in any way she can.
1:22:54|1:23:9|Master Shen and his family entered the venue, and in an instant, a group of people surrounded them. However, the cold light in their eyes made those people retreat step by step. Han, [Lung], and Owen on the second floor looked down at them disdainfully. At this moment, the thugs in the venue rushed out with big knives.
1:23:15|1:23:30|Chiang Yitien moves towards Lung aggressively, while Master Shen is in charge of the ground. Ding Lan, Ding Ju, and three other kids are responsible for clearing out the other people in the area. Ding Lan swings his right arm, his fist fiercely smashing into the enemy's face, his strikes are fast and fierce, the sound of his punches echoing.
1:23:30|1:23:47|Ding [Xiao Ding] raised his hands to the west and north, the three of them spinning like a whirlwind of fire and wind, leaving no enemy unscathed. With one man supporting the table with both hands, he flipped it with force, cleanly taking out one enemy with a kick. In an instant, all the surrounding enemies were dealt with by them.
1:23:47|1:23:52|Next, Ding [Xiao Ding] and three children worked closely together to make a large slingshot with rubber bands.
1:23:53|1:24:6|At the command, three large crates were ejected and slammed heavily onto the enemy's faces. [Han] was strong and struggled dangerously against Chiang Yitien. He was punched against the railing, but he countered every move, not allowing Chiang Yitien to gain the upper hand.
1:24:6|1:24:19|Ding [Xiao Mei] and [Lung] started fighting. Despite his lack of martial arts skills, his legs seemed a bit weak, but his extreme anger made him very brave. He didn't suffer any losses during the fight. Uncle Seven wanted to escape when he saw the situation, but he was cut in half by Master [Shen].
1:24:20|1:24:32|Lung was pushed back by Ding [Xiao Ding], stumbling backwards. Xiao Mei seized the opportunity to grab a glass bottle from the table, smashed it into two halves, and chased after Lung with it raised. The sharp glass cut his face, causing blood to gush out instantly.
1:24:32|1:24:43|Ding Mei chased heavily, overturned the table trying to pin down [Lung], but accidentally made him fall into the weapons room. [Lung] opened the box, grabbed a gun and aimed at Ding Mei, smiling sinisterly and terrifyingly.
1:24:44|1:24:59|Just as he was about to pull the trigger, a flying knife pierced [Lung]'s artery. Master Shen arrived in time to save his daughter. [Lung] struggled for a moment before falling silent. At this moment, the landlady's boat was fully loaded, the sailors pulled in the ropes, and the boat slowly started moving.
1:24:59|1:25:7|Here, Lung restrained Han's hand, making him unable to move. But the next second, Han struggled against the restraint and kicked him out several meters away.
1:25:7|1:25:24|Yidong's mouth was full of blood. Arrogant [Lung] was ready to pursue the attack, while Yidong grabbed a nearby chair and smashed it towards [Lung]'s leg. This made [Lung] even more furious, grabbing Yidong and punching him several times. Meanwhile, Mali punched Master Shen in the stomach, and [Xiao Lan] hurriedly kicked him away.
1:25:27|1:25:42|Master Shen hadn't had a chance to speak before being ambushed by [Owen], falling heavily down the stairs. [Owen] then tried to take advantage of the situation to deal with [Ding], but he managed to evade all his attacks. Seizing the opportunity, [Mary] fiercely kicked Master Shen, who was still recovering, and he struggled to dodge the blows.
1:25:42|1:25:49|[Chiang Yitien] turned around to resume the fight. Seeing his determination, [Han] contemptuously took off his sunglasses, clenched his fists, ready to completely subdue him.
1:25:49|1:26:0|[Chiang Yitien] takes the lead in using the bow, facing the fierce attacks from [Han]. He easily dodges using the shooting props in the field. Unable to harm him, [Han] becomes furious and unleashes a series of kicks, all of which [Chiang Yitien] effortlessly avoids.
1:26:0|1:26:12|But in the end, with the final kick, [Han] played unexpectedly, catching [Chiang Yitien] off guard. The table behind him was kicked several meters away. [Han] poised himself, ready to strike with his leg, looking arrogant as he planned to defeat [Chiang Yitien] in one fell swoop.
1:26:15|1:26:27|[Chiang Yitien] angrily rushed forward, embracing [Han] around the waist in an attempt to control his movements. However, he was met with a sharp elbow strike to the back and then grabbed by the neck, causing him to be pushed away and fall to the ground, looking completely disheveled.
1:26:27|1:26:32|On the other hand, [Lung] is calmly adjusting his suit, with a look of arrogance and domineering.
1:26:32|1:26:48|Faced with such provocation, [Chiang Yitien] was filled with anger. Suddenly, he had a bright idea and extended a spring rope from his sleeve, using it to fling a wooden stick towards [Han], then wrapping the spring rope around [Han]'s wrist, leveraging the force to fly towards him and kicking fiercely at his chest.
1:26:48|1:27:4|[Lung] reacted quickly and tried to counterattack using a spring rope. He pulled the rope to bring [Chiang Yitien] closer, but [Chiang Yitien] had a countermeasure ready. He skillfully extended the rope and [Lung] failed to harm the enemy, instead getting hit by the rope on his chin. Angered, he charged towards [Chiang Yitien] for another fierce attack.
1:27:6|1:27:22|Yitien, like a tiger with wings, used a spring rope to wrap around Lung's ankles, hips, and waist. With a strong pull, Lung fell straight to the ground. He tried to stand up and fight back several times, but every time he made a move, he was pulled down. He was thrown to the ground three or four times in a row, his expression gradually becoming fierce.
1:27:23|1:27:37|Owen closely pursued [Han], not giving him any chance to fight back. Knowing he couldn't beat him, [Han] just kept dodging. Just as Owen was about to make a fatal blow, [Captain Tang] burst in and quickly kicked Owen to the ground, reminding [Han].
1:27:38|1:27:49|[Xiao Ding] was worried about his father, so [Han] hurried out the door. Owen was forced to the wall by [Captain Tang]. He arrogantly believed he could defeat the opponent, so he adjusted his posture and charged towards [Captain Tang].
1:27:49|1:28:1|However, he was no match for her. [Mary] thought she had the upper hand and launched a series of attacks on [Master Shen]. In fact, [Master Shen] had a plan all along. He kicked over the tobacco on the cigarette maker.
1:28:2|1:28:15|[Mary] was blinded, her fighting ability plummeted, [Master Shen] took the opportunity to grab her leg and push it under the cutting machine. She then dodged to the side, pressed the start button, and as the machine started, a scream pierced the sky.
1:28:15|1:28:24|At this moment, the landlady ordered the servants to pour the alcohol in various corners of the boat. She held the fuse in her hand, exerting force at the bow of the boat, eagerly waiting to set off, excitement overflowing in her eyes.
1:28:26|1:28:40|On the other side, Yidong secured the spring rope to the wooden beam and swung back and forth holding onto the rope. Longwei couldn't hit him, couldn't kick him, and was repeatedly kicked down by [Chiang Yitien]. The once arrogant big guy was now completely defenseless after being beaten.
1:28:40|1:28:52|[Chiang Yitien] delivered a series of kicks, sending Han into a pile of teapots. He quickly followed, attempting to tie him up with a rope. However, Han, feeling humiliated, grabbed onto the spring rope and refused to let go. The two of them were locked in a fierce tug-of-war, neither willing to back down.
1:28:54|1:29:4|Captain Tang was about to take down Owen with a straight leg kick, but Owen saw through it and forced him to change his move, performing a handstand instead. However, immediately after, a leg sweep knocked Owen down to the ground.
1:29:4|1:29:17|Owen tried to sweep the legs of Captain Tang, but each move was countered. As he stood up, he attempted to use a two-finger wrap to blind Captain Tang. However, Captain Tang didn't give him the chance to get close, delivering a powerful kick that sent him flying.
1:29:21|1:29:35|Owen wanted to counterattack, but was sent flying back by a series of kicks from [Captain Tang]. Just as he was preparing his boxing and kicking stance, [Captain Tang] had already set up the situation. However, Owen rushed forward and intentionally used the leg technique that had been seen through by him earlier.
1:29:35|1:29:48|Owen wanted to continue using the old method to deal with him, but [Captain Tang] had already quietly taken off his shoes. He quickly pulled his leg back and stepped on Owen's hand that was holding the shoe in place. Before Owen could react, he was kicked out of the room by [Captain Tang] and fell to his death.
1:29:50|1:30:0|At this moment, [Chiang Yitien] has already tied the spring rope around [Han], but the two have a huge gap in strength. [Chiang Yitien] is kicked down by him again. [Han] uses the rope to pull him closer and continues to block.
1:30:0|1:30:5|[Chiang Yitien] quickly wrapped another rope around the wooden beam to counterbalance the situation.
1:30:5|1:30:11|But Lung pulled hard, the wooden beam broke, and Chiang Yitien fell heavily to the ground, looking at Shen Tinyi, who was caught off guard for a moment.
1:30:15|1:30:29|He first wildly swung the rope, making the opponent roll back and forth, then pulled him up and kicked him hard in the stomach. Taking advantage of the opponent's lack of response, he wrapped the rope around the opponent's neck, swiftly tied the remaining rope to a wooden beam, and then pulled the rope to ascend to the upper floor.
1:30:31|1:30:42|[Chiang Yitien] had his arms tied up, rendering his martial arts skills useless. As [Lung] made his move, [Chiang Yitien] gradually left the ground with both feet, struggling desperately to break the spring rope but to no avail.
1:30:42|1:30:50|Han exerted all his strength, pulling the rope tightly, even using his feet to push against the railing for leverage, as he watched [Chiang Yitien] being lifted higher and higher, his face turning pale and almost suffocating.
1:30:51|1:31:3|The rope broke under the strain, causing [Chiang Yitien] to fall to the ground, while Lung, due to inertia, tumbled into the large boiler behind him and was engulfed in flames.
1:31:3|1:31:13|[Chiang Yitien], who was lucky to be saved, sat on the ground, covering his neck and breathing fresh air heavily. At this moment, Lung ran out screaming and instinctively threw himself at [Chiang Yitien], wanting to die with him.
1:31:13|1:31:18|But [Chiang Yitien], seeing him burned so badly, picked up the bag and risked his life to help put out the fire.
1:31:19|1:31:31|At that moment, the landlady smashed the kerosene lamp and left gracefully. The explosives on the flower boat instantly ignited the oranges, and the explosion was deafening. It was then that [Lung] took his last breath.
1:31:31|1:31:38|[Shen Tinyi], [Captain Tang] and his family quickly evacuated upon hearing the sound, while Lung and others ultimately perished in the fire, getting their just deserts.
1:31:43|1:31:56|The factory buildings exploded one after another like dominoes. For a moment, flames shot up into the sky and black smoke billowed. Master Shen's family and the robust alliance ran out, followed by others from the factory.
1:32:1|1:32:11|[Master Shen] led a man and a woman running at the front, with a team following behind. As they ran out, they saw the flower boat belonging to the boss, which was burned down to just the windows, and suddenly everything became clear.
1:32:15|1:32:33|The absurd incident finally came to an end with everyone's joint efforts. As the situation calmed down, the Changfu Circus received support and returned to the stage. [Master Shen] led everyone to the stage as they did at the beginning, waving and smiling under the spotlight to the audience, their faces filled with joy.
1:32:33|1:32:50|The audience welcomed them back with enthusiastic applause. At this moment, in the circus, Xiao Mei took over as the clown instead of Yitien, the boss lady and Master Shen collaborated again to perform the magic flying knives, while Han and Xiao Lan performed the aerial acrobatics together, everyone's wishes were fulfilled.
1:32:50|1:33:2|[Xiao Mei] stood on the spot where her husband once performed, recalling the scene of Yitien falling down pretending to be dead. She wished it was all just a dream, and that after waking up, the clown would just laugh and stand up again.
1:33:3|1:33:14|But it all seems like a fantasy. [Xiao Mei] wakes up from her memories and starts performing with a smile. She begins to mimic the day, playing the clown to bring joy to others.
