0:0:50|0:1:6|[Ken Iguchi] has loved music since he was young. Walking on the street, he often immerses himself in the world of music, paying no attention to what is happening around him. When he arrives at the company's entrance, he accidentally knocks the head of the window-cleaning lady into a bucket of water without noticing. As he enters, he is surrounded by a group of reporters for an interview.
0:1:48|0:1:56|In the blink of an eye, [Jin Guzhi] cautiously arrived at the door of the boss's office. With a big house-like forehead, the boss's face was full of anger as he spoke.
0:2:49|0:2:57|The boss, furious, clenched his teeth and manually squeezed the oranges in his hand into orange juice. [Jin Guzhi], seeing this, nodded timidly and said with a guilty look on his face.
0:3:13|0:3:19|The boss, now with an impatient look on his face, closed his eyes and started to drive people away. Faced with the boss's ruthless expulsion, [Jin Guzhi] could only look resentful and slowly walk towards the door.
0:7:50|0:8:1|Wearing a high-end suit, the boss struggled to push [Igenzhuang] sitting in the car. Despite his best efforts, the boss, in a fit of anger, took off his coat and threw it onto the car, pointing at [Igenzhuang] inside and speaking.
0:8:4|0:8:22|[Igen Ken] looked at the angry boss in the rearview mirror, then quietly pushed the mirror down. On this side, the boss was still grimacing and pushing the car, until with a roar, the car started smoothly. The sudden start of the car also caused the boss to fall flat on his face as usual.
0:8:22|0:8:27|The boss got up from the ground with a bewildered look on his face, his expression spelled out four words - disbelief.
0:8:28|0:8:48|He spat out a mouthful of sand, his eyes burning with anger. He walked to the front of the car, opened the door in a grand manner, then suddenly remembered his coat that he had just dropped behind. He turned around to close the car door and retrieve the coat, but before he could get back in, the car slipped away.
0:8:48|0:8:53|No matter how he shouted and chased from behind, the car showed no intention of stopping.
0:9:2|0:9:9|And at this moment, [Jin Guzhi] was still walking on foot outside the car.
0:9:23|0:9:36|At this moment, the boss chasing the car was actually blocked by an iron fence, making the already difficult journey even more challenging. Meanwhile, [Jin Guzhi] in the car continued to drive forward with a silly smile on his face, completely unaware that the boss had not yet gotten in the car.
0:9:38|0:9:56|At this moment, the boss who was climbing over the iron fence fell down. With a crisp tearing sound, he flipped over, but his pants were left on the fence. The floating fragments of the pants in the wind seemed to be mercilessly mocking the boss lying on the ground with a big hole in his pants, looking utterly dejected.
0:9:57|0:10:9|The boss was thrown to the ground and dazedly looked around. Perhaps facing too many hardships today, he quickly pulled himself together, without complaining, just rubbed his butt, and struggled to get up.
0:10:9|0:10:26|He was wearing those thigh-high slit trousers, standing on the roadside looking around, raising his arm and thumb up, trying to flag down passing vehicles. Hoping for a kind soul to give him a ride back home to end this nightmare, but fate had other plans. The boss, unsuccessful in flagging down a car, lay despairingly on the roadside.
0:10:27|0:10:38|The scene cuts to Jin Guzhi, who miraculously comes back to life, standing on a tricycle holding the national flag. His face, originally covered in dirt, combined with his wind-blown messy hair at this moment, makes him look even more disheveled.
0:10:41|0:10:57|After enduring numerous hardships, Jin Guzhi finally got into the car, escaped from the highway, and returned to the city, sitting in the office. With a band-aid on his face, he angrily peeled an apple in front of the trembling culprit, [Yigen Jian].
0:10:57|0:11:3|He looked at the boss, swallowed nervously, hesitated, and finally mustered up the courage to speak to the boss.
0:11:9|0:11:13|The boss remained silent, continuing to peel the apple in his hand.
0:11:28|0:11:36|The boss glared at [Jin Guzhi], took a bite of the apple fiercely, panting heavily, still not speaking. [Jin Guzhi] glanced at the boss and spoke.
0:12:3|0:12:18|The boss was so angry that his lips trembled, he squatted down and took out a pair of leather shoes. After venting, the boss seemed to have lost all his strength and slumped down in the chair.
0:13:2|0:13:11|The next morning, [Jin Guzhi], who had lost his driving privileges, hurriedly carried a large box filled with discs and got on the bus in a long line.
0:13:14|0:13:26|Under the scorching sun, with only a few pedestrians on the street, [Jin Guzhi] carried a box on his shoulder, shuttling through the streets and alleys of the city, panting heavily and sweating profusely.
0:13:26|0:13:36|After a busy half day, [Jin Guzhi] found a place with a few vendors setting up stalls, sat down, took out a piece of bread and a bottle of mineral water from the box, and ate them hungrily.
0:13:38|0:13:47|But at this moment, the nearby [vendor] went crazy, rolled up the stall and ran away, leaving [Jin Guzhi] looking confused and unable to figure out the situation.
0:14:7|0:14:18|[Jin Guzhi] seized the box while the urban management officers were not paying attention, then ran off. And so, a city chase began between [Jin Guzhi] and the officers, but he didn't notice the cassette tapes falling behind him.
0:14:20|0:14:39|When [Jin Guzhi] successfully shook off the pursuers and ran into a narrow alley, panting heavily, he opened the box and looked down, only to find that the CDs in the box were long gone. With only an empty box left, [Jin Guzhi] threw the box on the ground, covered his face, and completely broke down. His sister [Yi Li] looked at her brother who had returned home and said.
0:14:57|0:15:10|[Igen Ken] watched as his sister handed him the money, then turned and walked away. He looked at the two hundred yuan in his hand, patted it against his chest, and stared blankly ahead, lost in thought.
0:16:33|0:16:38|The boss who doesn't mince words finished talking about [Yili], and then patiently checked his twisted ankle.
0:17:18|0:17:33|In this way, wearing high heels, [Yili] and the boss stood in front of the car, starting a fierce battle mode of not giving in to each other. The verbal battle ended with the boss lacking fighting power, driving away in embarrassment. Watching this, [Yili] was so angry that she shouted loudly.
0:18:41|0:18:58|Early the next morning, just as the sky was beginning to light up, [Jin Guzhi] arrived at the park with a clock and a guitar. The park was still quiet at this time. [Jin Guzhi] placed the clock on a rockery and sat cross-legged on the opposite side with the guitar in his arms, setting up a posture and staring motionlessly at the clock.
0:18:59|0:19:15|The clock kept ticking, time passing by second by second. [Jin Guzhi] remained in a pose, sitting there motionless. An old man passing by was intrigued by [Jin Guzhi]'s strange behavior. He bent down, curiously looking at [Jin Guzhi] holding a guitar, not knowing what he was up to.
0:19:16|0:19:35|Glancing at the ordinary clock across the way, the baffled old man walked up to the artificial rockery and leaned in for a closer look. After staring intently for a while, he still couldn't make heads or tails of it. Frustrated, he decided to approach it directly, imitating the manner of Jin Guzhi, and sat there motionless, staring blankly at the clock.
0:19:35|0:19:42|As time passed, more and more people were drawn to this strange scene, and there were more and more heads around observing the clock.
0:19:43|0:20:9|[Jin Guzhi]'s figure gradually disappeared in the crowded sea of people. With a sudden alarm clock ringing, the motionless [Jin Guzhi] finally spoke. As [Jin Guzhi] spoke, the onlookers scattered.
0:20:19|0:20:38|At this moment, [Jin Guzhi] lowered his head and stopped speaking, sighing heavily. He looked into the distance with a complex expression on his face, then drifted into a daydream. In the daydream, a group of burly men wearing sunglasses were beating up their boss in a secluded forest.
0:20:38|0:20:45|At this moment, [Jin Guzhi] descended like a hero, spreading out his cloak, holding a sword in his hand, and shouting loudly.
0:20:52|0:21:6|Originally, all the bad guys who were the boss's henchmen rushed towards [Jin Guzhi], raining punches down on the heroically saving [Jin Guzhi]. After a fierce fight, [Jin Guzhi] was defeated and lay on the ground, barely breathing.
0:21:6|0:21:14|The boss, trembling, crawled over and lay beside [Jin Guzhi], slowly lifting his head and looking at him affectionately.
0:21:26|0:21:34|Hearing what the boss said, [Jin Guzhi] nodded in satisfaction and went back to work. Back in reality, [Jin Guzhi] smiled as if he had come up with a good idea.
0:21:40|0:21:56|The scene shifts, the boss's daughter [Jin Guzhi] and a little dog are playing on the grass in the park, while the boss is exercising nearby, swinging his arms loudly. Meanwhile, [Yigen Jian] is hiding behind a trash can with a few people, secretly observing every move of the boss.
0:21:56|0:22:0|At this moment, a relatively cautious man spoke up.
0:22:7|0:22:26|During the discussion among the group, a passerby picked his nose and accurately threw the trash onto the head of one of the bald men. After that, everyone saw the boss take out two seemingly small dumbbells from behind a seemingly heavy dumbbell, and lifted them up. [Jin Guzhi] saw this and easily chuckled.
0:22:34|0:22:40|And at this moment, the bald man who was peeking was hit by a melon seed shell thrown by a passing middle-aged woman.
0:23:7|0:23:19|Suddenly, an old man who was gargling walked towards us. He spat the mouthwash into the trash can, splashing it all over Jin Guzhi's face. Everyone looked at him with disgust, and he could only helplessly wipe his face and say.
0:24:25|0:24:39|The boss looked at the two unexpected guests in confusion. He rolled up his sleeves and walked slowly towards them. But the next moment, the boss raised his hand and kicked Jin Guzhi to the ground. The other person, seeing this, limped away in panic.
0:24:41|0:24:53|At this moment, [Jin Guzhi], hiding behind the trash can, looked at everything in front of him in disbelief. Seeing the plan fail, [Jin Guzhi] turned and walked away, while his sister looked at the little dog in front of the boss's house.
0:25:14|0:25:20|The boss squinted his eyes, furrowed his brows, wrinkling his whole face into a ball, and glared at the puppy.
0:26:4|0:26:15|[Jin Guzhi] looked at [Jin Guzhi] with a disdainful expression, and smirked. The scene then shifted to the precious dog of the boss, who was anxiously barking in its cage outside the door.
0:26:47|0:27:0|After Jin Guzhi and Jin Guzhi left the court, they rushed out of the door. As soon as they stepped out, they saw the boss and Jin Yue looking at the precious dog locked in a cage. Jin Guzhi met the boss's angry face and guiltily lowered his head.
0:27:23|0:27:32|The boss finished speaking, put down his crossed legs, stood up from the sofa, hands on hips, angrily walked towards [Igen Ken], staring into his eyes.
0:27:42|0:27:51|After the boss left, the three siblings were left at home, looking at each other in silence. The younger brother looked around, sighed, and said angrily.
0:28:45|0:28:57|After the younger brother finished speaking, he looked at the unreliable duo in front of him and left. As the night grew darker, [Igen Ken] lying on the bed tossed and turned, unable to sleep. He turned off the light, and the words his younger brother said before leaving gradually appeared in his mind.
0:29:4|0:29:18|In the dim light of dawn, Jin Guzhi, who had not slept all night, arrived at a secluded place with swollen eyes. Surrounded by abandoned European-style buildings, the once magnificent structures had become dilapidated after enduring the wind and rain day after day.
0:29:19|0:29:35|The streets were deserted, with no one in sight. [Jin Guzhi] looked around, the walls were uneven and the wall paint had long peeled off. Cobwebs filled the corners, and as the cold wind blew, the pearl net between the broken walls swayed with the wind. The inner walls still bore the marks of rain.
0:29:35|0:29:43|Further ahead, scattered gravel and debris covered the ground, with wild grass growing everywhere and wild vines twining up the broken door lintel.
0:29:44|0:30:0|Jin Guzhi walked slowly into one of the buildings, looking around and carefully examining everything. The walls were already delicate and spotted. Seeing everything in front of him, he seemed to relax, drinking water heavily. After finishing the water, he continued to move forward.
0:30:0|0:30:13|Upstairs, in the dim light shining through the poor hole, the sunlight revealed the fine dust floating in the air. [Jin Guzhi] saw a dirty-faced, long-haired [vagabond] surrounded by smoke.
0:30:14|0:30:30|The homeless man [Jin Guzhi] who was eating, saw someone approaching but didn't pay much attention. He just glanced casually, then continued gnawing on the chicken leg, occasionally taking a sip of beer on the side. Behind the homeless man were some simple daily necessities, looking like he had made a home in this abandoned building.
0:30:30|0:30:35|[The homeless man] looked up in confusion as [Jin Guzhi] approached, and [Jin Guzhi] immediately spoke.
0:32:9|0:32:13|The homeless man glanced up and down, Jin Guzhi said.
0:34:48|0:35:2|[Iken Ken] looked at the man in front of him, took out a few hundred yuan from his pocket, counted a few bills, but hesitated a bit. Just as he was about to take it back, the quick-eyed [Jin Guzhi] reached out and snatched it away.
0:35:44|0:35:51|At night, [Jin Guzhi], who had planned everything, sneakily approached the boss's car and peeked inside through the window.
0:36:45|0:36:49|The rejected siblings took out two pig head masks from their bag and put them on.
0:37:22|0:37:38|The two looked at the boss who agreed to let them help passively, and hurriedly ran all the way to the back of the car, pushing the boss sitting in the car. The boss looked at the two who were pushing the car with all their heart and smiled with relief, but as soon as the car was pushed a little distance, it couldn't be moved no matter what.
0:38:9|0:38:13|The brother and sister were delighted and opened the car door hastily to follow [the boss] into the car.
0:38:15|0:38:36|The car slowly started moving and soon arrived at a deserted place. In front of the building, the steps were covered with weeds, looking eerie under the moonlight. As the car stopped, Jin Guzhi was the first to get out and rushed into the building. The boss poked his head out and asked about the building in front of him.
0:39:8|0:39:26|[Igen Ken] closed the car door, ran to the back of the car and stuffed the banana in his hand into the exhaust pipe, then slipped away. Meanwhile, [Boss], who was sitting in the car, was completely unaware and ready to set off. However, he found that the car wouldn't start no matter what, and shouted desperately for [Igen Ken].
0:39:38|0:39:52|Unable to call out for [Jin Guzhi], [the boss] opened the car door with a look of resentment, ready to go in search of [Jin Guzhi]. Just as he saw [the boss] inside the building, he was startled by the pitch-black environment.
0:39:52|0:40:2|In the dark building, unable to see a thing, [Jin Guzhi], the boss who entered the building, complained while waving his arms to find his way, cautiously feeling his way forward.
0:40:4|0:40:18|Wearing a mask, [Igen Ken] sat in the back holding a guitar, watching the anxious [boss] with widening eyes. At this moment, a beam of light suddenly lit up behind the boss. Turning around, he saw the siblings [Igen Ken] who had suddenly appeared wearing masks.
0:41:54|0:42:3|[Jin Guzhi] and his sister exchanged a glance, and the next moment, the boss was taken into the building and tied up. The two siblings looked at each other, and the boss, with a look of resentment, spoke.
0:44:12|0:44:19|The two of them, whether to explain first or listen first, started an endless debate. Meanwhile, [Jin Guzhi] was completely unaware at home.
0:46:44|0:46:53|Upon hearing this, Jin Guzhi's eyes flickered as if he had just realized something. The scene then shifted to Gongzhuang, who was about to leave to find his boss when the phone rang.
0:47:42|0:47:45|Upon hearing his wife's words, the boss, who had originally closed his eyes, suddenly widened them.
0:48:5|0:48:8|After Jin Guzhi finished speaking, [Igen Ken] turned his head, covered his ears, and went back to sleep.
0:49:1|0:49:7|Upon hearing this, Jin Guzhi, who had a determined expression on his face, gradually collapsed and said with a flicker in his eyes.
0:49:49|0:49:51|[Jin Guzhi] said her parents went missing.
0:49:59|0:50:14|In the abandoned building, the boss and a [Igen Ken] were facing off against two aggressive opponents, each refusing to back down. Before long, the younger brother [Igen Zhuang] arrived with his girlfriend [Jin Guzhi] in a taxi.
0:50:18|0:50:21|[Jin Guzhi] walked in and saw four people sitting together, each refusing to yield to the other.
0:51:19|0:51:32|The boss and his family were all tied up with swords in a bizarre way, fulfilling the request for a family reunion. The boss opened his eyes wide, trying to see clearly the absurdity in front of him, feeling incredulous.
0:51:32|0:51:47|A [Jin Guzhi] holding a steaming kettle, poured a basin of hot water for the boss's family to wash their faces. The boss pushed it aside directly upon seeing it, speaking as if scolding. Waking up his sleeping wife next to him, the boss's wife looked at the hot water in front of her and shook her head, saying.
0:51:47|0:52:4|[Jin Guzhi] looked around and saw that no one was responding. With a sigh, she shook her head, placed the basin on a nearby chair, and silently sat down next to the also bound [Jin Zhuang]. As the older sister, [Jin Guzhi] couldn't help but feel heartbroken seeing her younger brother [Jin Zhuang] sitting there despondent and silent.
0:52:4|0:52:9|Unable to bear watching his younger brother suffer, [Jin Guzhi] pulled on the rope in [Igenzhuang]'s hand and said to him.
0:52:15|0:52:24|[Igen Zhuang] shook off [Igen Jian]'s hand and turned his head to the side. At this moment, [Igen Jian] curled his arms and walked to the boss's side, trying to please him.
0:54:37|0:54:47|Just as Jin Guzhi was buying fried dough sticks, the homeless man who used to live in this abandoned building suddenly returned. The homeless man walked over, smiling and touching his face.
0:55:19|0:55:24|The young man selling fried dough sticks didn't hear Jin Guzhi's call, so he hopped on his bicycle and chased after Jin Guzhi.
0:56:23|0:56:38|Just like that, the homeless man [Jin Guzhi], who thought he was just acting, also had his hands tied. He looked at the boss's family who were also tied up, and greeted them with a smile. Bro, let me tell you the truth, said the homeless man, looking around, finally realizing that something was not quite right.
0:57:10|0:57:15|When [Jin Guzhi] returned with breakfast, looking exhausted, the [vagrant] looked at him with a face full of surprise.
0:57:26|0:57:41|The boss glanced at the breakfast placed in front of him by [Igen Ken], scratched his nose, and closed his eyes. [Igen Ken] sighed and placed the breakfast next to the boss. When he turned around, he realized that the person next to him was actually a [vagabond].
0:58:31|0:58:42|At this moment, the fried dough stick vendor also closely followed [Jin Guzhi] to the vicinity of the building. Riding a bicycle, the fried dough stick vendor was not much slower than [Jin Guzhi], and quickly chased after him.
0:58:42|0:58:56|The oil stick guy, who had already ridden past the building, suddenly saw Jin Guzhi's car reversing back, stopping at the entrance and looking around as if not believing anyone would live here. After confirming for a while, he finally parked the car and entered the building.
0:58:58|0:59:6|On the other side, the boss's wife in the building was still holding a youtiao, trying to feed the boss. The boss, who had his eyes closed, was startled by the youtiao being brought to his mouth.
0:59:8|0:59:14|After going through all kinds of hardships to deliver the money, the oil stick delivery guy, [Jin Guzhi], suddenly appeared in front of everyone, catching them off guard.
0:59:57|1:0:4|The fried dough stick vendor looked at the crowd behind him and finally sensed something was amiss. Seizing the opportunity, the boss gave a meaningful look to the vendor.
1:0:22|1:0:32|Hearing this, Jin Guzhi ran off in a hurry, but to his frustration, he ended up running in circles along the corridor, unable to find the door.
1:0:45|1:0:53|Thus, the hostage group gained a new member as the fried dough stick guy was also tied up. [Jin Guzhi], seeing this, reached out and handed his own fried dough stick to him.
1:1:18|1:1:34|With a face full of grievances, [Jin Guzhi] looked at the eager oil stick boy and then glanced at the serious [Jin Zhaung], and could only reluctantly give him half of the hamburger. The oil stick boy took the hamburger without a care and started eating, making the nearby [vagrant] drool.
1:2:55|1:3:4|The scene shifts, with Jin Guzhi wearing leather shoes, struggling to pedal a tricycle. On the tricycle are the two pots of flowers and a duck that the fried dough stick vendor mentioned had just been bought.
1:3:7|1:3:22|In the blink of an eye, Jin Guzhi rode through the desolate streets on a bike. He returned to the building with something in hand. Inside the building, everyone looked puzzled as they watched a person squatting there feeding the ducks.
1:3:37|1:3:52|After speaking, a person slung the sword over his shoulder. A person slightly smaller than the sword, surprisingly looked effortless, even swaying it a couple of times. The person who made it to the top floor couldn't stand steadily, and brightly put his younger brother down.
1:3:57|1:4:2|After scratching his head and chin in contemplation, [Jin Guzhi] spoke.
1:4:30|1:4:39|Unsuccessful in persuading, a helpless Jin Guzhi carried the sword on his shoulder. Walking downstairs, he looked at Igen Ken, who was arranging flowers, and said to himself.
1:5:32|1:5:48|The boss, like Jin Guzhi, passionately scolded the sword-shaped object. The sword-shaped object listened with a pained expression, wanting to interrupt the boss's incessant chatter several times but never finding the opportunity to speak. The boss became more and more excited as he spoke, his facial expressions gradually contorting, sometimes smiling happily, sometimes filled with sorrow.
1:7:3|1:7:18|[Igen Ken] glared angrily at the smirking oil stick guy, not saying a word, just holding up the stinky sock in his hand in front of him. The oil stick guy, seeing this, was so scared that he opened his mouth wide, widened his eyes, swallowed hard, and dared not make a sound again.
1:7:19|1:7:31|Jin Guzhi took the socks from Iguchi Ken's hand and looked at him, then stuffed them into his own mouth with a pained expression, indicating that he would no longer make any noise. The homeless man next to him caught on quickly and also showed a strong will to survive.
1:7:32|1:7:46|Taking the initiative to take off his socks, Jin Guzhi obediently stuffed them into his mouth, looking pitifully at [Yigen Jian]. Meanwhile, the boss here was still stubbornly gesturing to his wife, planning an escape. Yigen Jian and Yigen Jian next to him completely ignored him, busy organizing toiletries.
1:7:46|1:7:53|[Igen Ken] took out a set of dentures from the bag and handed them to the boss's wife. Then he walked up to the boss, took out a toothbrush cup, and said to the boss:
1:8:8|1:8:20|The boss's wife accepted the dentures on behalf of the boss who refused, while [Jin Guzhi] continued to smile and distribute them one by one without missing anyone.
1:8:26|1:8:43|The boss remained silent upon seeing [Jin Guzhi]. The boss's wife glanced around, then pulled the sock out of the boss's mouth. With the sock removed, the boss let out a deep sigh and remained silent, staring ahead with a numb expression. The boss's wife took the mouthwash cup handed by [Igen Ken] and placed it in front of the boss.
1:8:43|1:8:49|The boss took a look and finally opened his mouth. Unexpectedly, the next second he actually pressed down the mouthwash.
1:9:13|1:9:22|After speaking, [Jin Guzhi] stood up and walked out. Sitting on the steps, [Jin Guzhi] looked melancholic, lowered his head and pulled out a weed, fidgeting with it irritably.
1:11:21|1:11:31|The crowd was startled and looked at the suddenly enraged and breathless [Igen Zhuang]. At this moment, [Jin Guzhi] stood up and came to comfort [Igen Zhuang].
1:13:35|1:13:42|Listening to everyone's persuasion, the boss fell into contemplation. After a long pause, he opened his mouth and said to [Jin Guzhi].
1:13:49|1:13:59|And at this moment, [Jin Guzhi], who was standing on the rooftop, suddenly heard his sister's voice. He turned around, furrowed his brow, and looked at his sister, saying.
1:14:26|1:14:32|Upon hearing Jin Guzhi's words, Jin Guzhi paused for a moment, shook his head with a bitter smile, and said.
1:14:50|1:15:13|Hearing this, [Jin Guzhi] widened his eyes and looked at his sister in disbelief. Downstairs, the people who had been untied were massaging, arm wrestling, all looking like they wanted to die. Looking down, the boss spoke.
1:15:21|1:15:41|[Ken Iguchi] looked around and immediately sat down obediently. A moment later, [Ken Iguchi] also looked at the boss and found an empty seat to sit down. The boss, after looking at everyone who had already settled down, finally felt satisfied and continued to speak.
1:15:52|1:16:8|The homeless man [Jin Guzhi] suddenly burst into laughter, which almost made the boss fall off his chair. He looked at the frowning [Yili] and fearfully stuffed his socks into his mouth. Upon hearing this, the two of them formed an alliance and spat out the socks.
1:17:0|1:17:13|[Ken Iguchi] looked surprised as he smiled and reached out his hand towards the boss in front of him. Just as they were about to shake hands and make peace, they were suddenly interrupted by the sound of police sirens. Everyone looked outside together and saw several police cars heading towards them.
1:17:13|1:17:33|The car stopped downstairs, and a group of police officers from the training camp got out of the car. They held guns and aimed them at the building. Inside the building, [Yili] was scared and covered her ears. She comforted him and reported the situation. Looking back, [Jin Guzhi] and the fried dough stick guy followed with a small stool.
1:17:33|1:17:40|[Jin Guzhi] and his mother huddled together, and the boss unexpectedly had a gun pointed at his head.
1:18:45|1:18:49|Upon hearing the captain's orders, the police officers swiftly surrounded the entire building with their guns.
1:19:27|1:19:38|The boss's wife here was just about to turn around when she was pulled back by [Jin Guzhi]. After finishing speaking, the thug looked at the people in the building again, staring at [Yigen Jian] intently, and after thinking for a while, he spoke.
1:19:46|1:19:58|[Igen Ken] slowly walked towards the thug holding a gun, approached him, and the thug kicked the boss onto the bed. The boss, who was kicked onto the bed, sat up and pointed back at the thug to shield himself.
1:20:25|1:20:34|The thugs were dumbfounded as they looked at the crowd unwilling to leave, holding their guns, not knowing who to aim at for a moment. Meanwhile, the police downstairs had quietly surrounded the area.
1:21:25|1:21:36|After saying this, [Jin Guzhi] raised his head high, looking straight at the villain. The villain, feeling nervous, licked his lips and tightened his grip on the gun pointed at him.
1:22:15|1:22:19|[Jin Guzhi] swallowed and continued speaking.
1:22:43|1:23:2|[Igen Zhuang] and [Ili] watched the two of them nervously. Behind the Dai Hall, Jin Guzhi widened his eyes in disbelief. He turned his head towards the direction pointed by [Igen Jian], and the homeless man and the fried dough stick vendor nodded in response.
1:23:44|1:23:50|Pressed tightly against us with his own body.
1:24:7|1:24:25|The crowd here was deeply moved, tears welling up in their eyes. When it came to Jin Guzhi, a faint smile suddenly appeared on his face. He looked at Iguchi and Iguchi Zhuang, trembling lips as he spoke.
1:25:38|1:25:52|At the thought of all this, [Jin Guzhi] felt like there was a sharp and merciless knife in his heart, cutting his heart one by one, with blood dripping drop by drop. The pain was so sharp and profound.
1:26:12|1:26:33|The silent criminal was engaged in a fierce internal struggle. He lowered his gun and looked at the sincere face of [Igen Ken]. As he gazed at the hand reaching out before him, the expression on the criminal's face rapidly changed. His pale lips trembled, but no sound came out.
1:26:33|1:26:38|As the sound of the gun hitting the ground rang out, the criminal slowly reached out his hand and placed it on [Jin Guzhi]'s hand.
1:26:42|1:27:5|The police turned around in surprise after hearing the words. Another police officer who heard it hurriedly walked towards the building, while the sniper upstairs was also closely watching the movements of the criminals. [Igen Ken], who was also being held by the police, turned his head and smiled at the criminal. After speaking, he followed the police and the people inside the building also followed suit.
1:27:8|1:27:26|Upon hearing the shout from behind, [Jin Guzhi] turned around and saw the person who had just shared a life-and-death experience with him standing behind him. Watching as [Jin Guzhi] was taken away by the police, the boss said with tears in his eyes.
1:27:56|1:28:11|With the closing of the door, [Jin Guzhi] was taken away in a police car to face his unknown fate. The siblings, [Jin Guzhi]'s brother and sister, knelt on the ground watching their brother's figure disappear into the distance. At this moment, this grand kidnapping incident came to an end.
