0:2:56|0:3:10|After bowing and taking his leave, the scene shifts to a misty rain setting, where [Yang Cang] is already standing outside the [Pei State Governor's Mansion]. The mansion is built against the mountains, nestled among the rocks, with mountains at its back and water surrounding it, presenting a formidable defensive position.
0:3:10|0:3:25|In the court, a young girl and a woman sat on either side of the hanging platform. The woman remained silent, picking up coins and tossing them into a tortoise shell, then placing it in front of her forehead and shaking it again.
0:4:7|0:4:14|The girl called out to [Pei Liang] behind the screen. The girl, named [Qing Ping], is the eldest princess of [Pei Country].
0:5:0|0:5:6|[Pei Liang] stood in the center of the court, pointing a finger at the Grand Commander [Ziyu]. Seeing him not responding, he actually condescended to step forward.
0:5:59|0:6:8|The spacious court reverberated with lingering echoes, as the hall wind passed through with a sound. The strands of hair beside the temples of the crowd stirred with the intense atmosphere of the moment.
0:7:24|0:7:36|[Qing Ping] raised her hand and with a wave, a rustling sound was heard in the hall. In a moment, a zither and a lute were placed in front of everyone. It was only then that they realized the woman was actually the Grand Marshal of [Pei Kingdom], the wife of [Ziyu], named [Xiaoai].
0:7:36|0:8:10|[Pei Liang] bent down to gently stroke the strings of the zither, then gestured towards [Ziyu] and spoke of the golden words of a sovereign, as a loyal subject, one should respect the will of the emperor. However, despite [Pei Liang]'s repeated requests, this couple remained unmoved. Beside them, [Yang Cang] stood with a bowed head, and upon seeing [Xiaoai] already seated in front of the ancient zither, he softly advised.
0:8:10|0:8:27|[Ziyu], standing still, with a stern look in his eyes, stood in front of everyone with his hands behind his back. Although not wearing armor, the chilling aura of long-held power still made people shudder. After much consideration, [Ziyu] finally walked slowly to [Xiaoai]'s side and sat down.
0:8:28|0:8:35|Pei Liang also breathed a sigh of relief, standing in front of the couple in a long robe, listening attentively.
0:9:2|0:9:8|Pei Liang found Xiaoai's responses amusing, and he bent down in front of her with a smile.
0:9:31|0:9:42|Qing Ping finished speaking and turned to leave. The four people in the hall seemed to be in a trance, their bodies motionless, only the incense burner next to [Xiaoai] emitting blue smoke. Plucking the strings with her fingers, she listened as the silver bottle suddenly broke, and the zither played the Seven-Character Poem.
0:10:2|0:10:10|After playing the guqin, [Ziyu] remained sitting upright, showing no intention of playing the instrument.
0:10:19|0:10:28|In a flurry of rolling and tumbling, [Xiaoai] unexpectedly snatched the bow knife and, panting, swung it towards her own hand.
0:10:30|0:10:39|[Ziyu] turned over and grabbed his wife's wrist, taking the string knife off and holding it in his hand as he said, turning his head.
0:10:43|0:11:10|The sharp blade edge, too late to stop, the cut hair has fallen onto the strings. It is said that the body's skin and hair are given by the parents, and one dare not destroy or harm them. Filial piety begins with this. Today's actions first disregard the distinction between ruler and subject, and then violate the norms of propriety and law of the family and society.
0:12:14|0:12:39|Lu Yan immediately leaned in to listen to [Pei Liang] beside him. Seeing Lu Yan bowing and leaving, there was a hint of coldness in [Pei Liang]'s eyes, completely different from the previous debauched king. The scene then shifted to the Governor's Mansion, which was completely different from the surrounding mountains and waters. Inside the mansion, there were numerous screens, with dim lighting casting shadows. Walking between pavilions, [Xiaoai], as the mistress of a prestigious family, was unexpectedly guarded, coming alone to a side hall.
0:12:39|0:12:53|In front of the wall painted with a picture of the Qing Song River water and strange rocks, [Xiaoai] confirmed that there was no one around, then she squatted down and skillfully opened the mechanism controlling the wall. With a light push of her palm on the strange rock picture, the wall slightly popped outwards, revealing a secret passage behind.
0:12:53|0:13:10|[Xiaoai] walked in sideways, and the outer wall returned to its original state. The secret passage was deep and dark, without any candles, but with a faint light shining down from above. It seemed to be a hidden and narrow place in the mountains where the Governor's Mansion was located. The passage led to a cave.
0:13:10|0:13:22|Two men sat cross-legged on the platform with their bare upper bodies. Looking closely, they both had the face of [Ziyu], one robust and the other weak.
0:13:47|0:14:2|Without discussing the identities of the two, the weak Ziyu wielded the knife back and forth on the robust Ziyu's chest. The person being cut by the knife showed no resistance at all. This alone is enough to be shocking. The tip of the knife stained with blood, Ziyu was already in so much pain that he couldn't speak.
0:14:11|0:14:18|Ziyu, weak and feeble, applied the ointment to the wound, only to hear a scream.
0:15:10|0:15:26|A series of wheezing sounds like a broken bellows, the frail Ziyu seemed as weak as if suffering from a serious illness. He immersed his hands in a copper basin, washing away the bloodstains.
0:15:51|0:16:9|Frail [Ziyu] fiercely smashed the towel into the basin, splashing water everywhere, and then stared at the person in front of him panting heavily. The scene shifted, and the two were already separated. Frail [Ziyu] sat under the stone wall, with a Tai Chi Yin Yang board in front of him, holding black and white pieces, contemplating. Meanwhile, [Xiaoai] was tending to the wounds of the burly [Ziyu].
0:16:9|0:16:25|The two bodies were close, their eyes locked in a moment of panic. Ziyu coughed weakly, prompting Xiaoai to come to his side.
0:16:48|0:16:55|After a few words, it became clear that the weak one is the commander, while the strong one is just a fake Ziyu replaced by Jingzhou.
0:16:58|0:17:6|Upon hearing these words, [Jingzhou] looked at the commander in front of him, repeating resolutely. [Ziyu] looked at [Jingzhou] with disheveled hair, nodding vigorously.
0:17:26|0:17:43|He did not answer as [Jingzhou] reached out to help [Xiaoai] down. He walked over to [Jingzhou], who was dressed in a black robe that almost blended with the dark cave walls. He slightly bowed his body, his gaze coldly fixed on [Jingzhou].
0:17:49|0:18:3|[Ziyu] placed his hand on [Jingzhou]'s shoulder to show his concern. When the bleeding on [Jingzhou]'s chest stopped, and [Xiaoai] helped [Ziyu] lie down to rest, the two of them then left the secret chamber one after the other.
0:18:3|0:18:17|In the Prefectural Government House, the zither and the se are playing together. Following Ziyu's instructions, Xiaoai begins to guide Jingzhou in playing the zither. Jingzhou by his side does not understand the meaning, just looks at Xiaoai sideways. Seeing this, Xiaoai gets up and sits closer.
0:18:22|0:18:34|While plucking the strings and adjusting the knobs, he did not notice that [Jingzhou] was not looking at the zither, but at the mistress.
0:18:42|0:18:54|After the sound editing was finished, [Xiaoai] cast a demure glance at [Jingzhou] who was sitting in front of the zither. [Jingzhou] averted his gaze, never daring to overstep, yet constantly feeling the warmth on his clothes.
0:19:0|0:19:21|The so-called harmony of qin and se, mutual understanding, although this duet does not have such skill, under the mutual resonance, it has also brought the distance between the two closer. At the entrance of the secret passage, [Ziyu] changed into a white robe, standing under the narrow and dangerous place, the mountain wind blowing, his flying hair like rain.
0:19:21|0:19:38|[Jingzhou] is not proficient in music, but [Ziyu] and [Xiaoai] are like a qin and se in harmony. Even in the fighting room, [Ziyu] can still feel the outside sound of the qin. His eyes are sharp, but with a hint of coldness, as if he can see through the walls and stare at the two outside.
0:19:38|0:19:50|As night fell, the already dim Governor's Mansion felt even more gloomy, with only a few bamboo lamps struggling to emit light. Fortunately, the cold moonlight seeped through the curtains and draped over the furnishings in the mansion, revealing a desolate atmosphere.
0:19:52|0:20:7|In the interior, [Xiaoai] and [Jingzhou] undressed and sat behind the screen and bed. Two maids spread out the bedding and then left without looking back. When they were gone, and there was no one else in the room, [Jingzhou] cautiously took a glance.
0:20:7|0:20:26|Ziyu then stood up and bowed to Xiaoai, who nodded slightly in response. The two of them were truly respectful to each other. For over a year, they had been secretly sleeping in separate beds without anyone in the mansion knowing. Jingzhou left the attendants and walked into the courtyard, skillfully pulling out a mattress from the corner.
0:20:26|0:20:45|Beside a bamboo lamp in the corridor, [Xiaoai] was lying on the ground, gently touching his chest soaked with ointment. During this time, her beautiful eyes also looked through the light gauze canopy from afar, with moonlight shining like water, flowing into the world. On the screen, clusters of snow plum blossoms were hidden among the green bamboo.
0:20:45|0:21:8|However, this beautiful scenery is no match for the beauty of [Xiaoai], who is as delicate as powder and as pure as snow. She looks at [Jingzhou] with a look of worry in her eyes. The moonlight gently falls on [Xiaoai]'s face, with a hint of sadness in her tranquility, like the moon shadow washing the green gauze with the wind, her worried expression forever youthful.
0:21:8|0:21:22|Seeing her husband becoming increasingly crazy due to his obsession, and with someone as similar to Ziyu as Jingzhou by her side, Xiaoai, like the passing years, blooming like flowers, hesitated to act on her springtime heart.
0:21:24|0:21:39|In the morning, two maids helped [Jingzhou] change into court attire and then were sent out, leaving only him and [Xiaoai] in the room. [Jingzhou] looked majestic, and [Xiaoai] seemed a bit dazed when she saw him. She walked slowly to [Jingzhou], took out something from her sleeve, and spoke.
0:21:45|0:21:51|After Xiaoai finished speaking, she took Jingzhou's hand and placed a plain silk sachet embroidered with three clusters of white plum blossoms and cloud patterns in his palm.
0:22:12|0:22:20|Turning his head, Xiaoai looked at Jingzhou for a while before speaking.
0:22:34|0:22:39|Upon hearing this, [Jingzhou] slumped onto the table, his eyes losing focus, and began to speak.
0:23:47|0:23:54|[Jingzhou] spoke with a heavy heart, and [Xiaoai] listened with discomfort, then gently placed her slender hand on his shoulder.
0:24:5|0:24:13|Jingzhou, under Hong Su's command, felt the pent-up emotions dissipating, sensing the warmth around him. He daringly rested his head gently on the chest of the person beside him.
0:24:14|0:24:24|[Xiaoai], a few years older than him, has watched him grow up since he entered the mansion of [Jingzhou]. At this moment, a sense of tenderness inevitably arises in her heart, so she allows him to be reckless this time.
0:24:24|0:24:40|Holding [Jingzhou] in a daze, he unexpectedly hugged [Xiaoai] around the waist and hips, startling him to immediately push away. [Xiaoai] turned his back, leaving behind a long waist-length hair, and the scene shifted to outside the Pei Kingdom palace, where civil and military officials were disembarking from two boats one after another.
0:24:40|0:24:55|In the midst of wind and rain, everyone stood in line on the platform outside the hall, as if it had become a common sight in the continuous rain of Pei Kingdom. [Pei Liang] lay on the main seat of the hall, although his physique was strong, the words he spoke were full of laziness.
0:25:24|0:25:30|Lu Yan listened, bowed and stood beside [Jingzhou], and said.
0:25:44|0:25:50|Tian Zhan drove away four palace eunuchs and bowed to the palace from a distance.
0:25:52|0:26:12|Led by him, the civil and military officials pleaded with [Pei Liang] to withdraw the decree, but [Jingzhou] stood up straight and opened his arms. Then four eunuchs behind him stepped forward to take the seal from his waist, remove the court cap from his head, and help him out of his armor and long robe, not long after.
0:26:12|0:26:19|With only a shabby robe left, [Pei Liang] stood alone in the court, overlooking the officials and slowly spoke.
0:27:0|0:27:23|Jingzhou, who was already leaving in plain clothes, was stopped by Pei Liang calling out Qing Ping to stop her mischief. Pei Liang, with his clothes hanging like ink, walked towards Jingzhou. He walked down the steps with his head lowered, and said:
0:28:4|0:28:19|[Pei Liang] presented himself with the majesty of an emperor in this debate, causing a stir among the civil and military officials in the court. Standing behind the screen in full armor, [Qing Ping] furrowed her brows as she watched her brother [Jingzhou] being pressured.
0:28:24|0:28:48|[Jingzhou] tore off the bandages on his body, revealing the chest wound, the wound of the Governor is the wound of the country. After saying this, [Pei Liang] used a silver spoon to scoop up the ointment from the bottle and approached the bare back of [Jingzhou], focusing on the wound without looking away. However, the spoon in his hand hesitated and did not apply the ointment to the wound. [Pei Liang] asked,
0:28:52|0:29:4|Upon hearing these words, the officials were shocked. The Yang family's knife skills were powerful and fierce, and those who were injured by their knives were all unable to resist their dominance. If it weren't for extraordinary talent, the wounds would never have healed on their own.
0:29:50|0:30:1|Hearing the former top general's words, [Pei Liang] was burning with anger, his face instantly turning extremely grim. Only to see [Jingzhou] putting on sacrilegious clothes, decisively leaving amidst the stunned silence of the civil and military officials.
0:30:1|0:30:14|Pei Liang, the dignified ruler of a country, was unexpectedly ignored by him in the court, throwing the ointment into Lu Yan's hands. [Pei Liang] then turned around and faced away from the courtiers, looking at his own throne, with a hint of real fire in his eyes.
0:30:16|0:30:22|The misty rain drifts, the river is wide, and under the tranquility, there always seems to be an undercurrent surging within.
0:30:22|0:30:45|[Jingzhou] lay on the blackwood boat, his sacrificial robe stained with blood. Opening the sachet given by [Xiaoai], he applied the medicinal powder to his wound. The powder mixed with blood, causing intense pain. Even the seven-foot-tall [Jingzhou] couldn't help but cry out in pain. When the medicine's effects wore off, he was drenched in sweat. Despite this, [Jingzhou] continued to support himself, caressing the sachet given by [Xiaoai].
0:31:3|0:31:11|In the confined room, the warmth of the candlelight reflected on Xiaoai's face as she listened to Ziyu's words, but her expression remained starkly pale.
0:31:19|0:31:28|In the grand hall, the plain silk hung from the beams and lay on the ground, with the newly written "Ode to Peace" on the surface, the majestic and grandiose strokes resembling dragons and snakes, witnessing the extraordinary ink treasures of [Pei Liang].
0:32:3|0:32:21|Separated on either side of the screen, the siblings locked eyes, and [Qing Ping] suddenly felt that she had never been so estranged from her brother. The scene shifted to the Tai Chi battle formation in the secret chamber.
0:32:35|0:32:51|[Ziyu] and [Jingzhou] stood in the center of the Yin-Yang formation, with [Xiaoai] solemnly holding an umbrella outside the formation. A half-height bamboo pole was waved by [Ziyu], creating numerous splashes of water in the formation. On the other side, [Jingzhou] held a mysterious umbrella in front of him for defense. Without hesitation, [Ziyu] moved the bamboo umbrella forward, and the sound of their umbrellas clashing was like muffled thunder.
0:32:55|0:33:17|With just three moves, [Jingzhou] was forced back ten steps, feeling unsettled. He then used a long pole as a staff, walked back to the Yang Fish Formation, inhaling like the wind and exhaling like a crack, intending to break [Yang Cang]'s sword technique and find a way to defeat the enemy. When the two of them stood still, [Jingzhou] wielded his umbrella and attacked, reversing the offense and defense. Only to see [Ziyu] using a bamboo staff as a blue blade, opening and closing widely.
0:33:17|0:33:25|With the momentum of a fierce tiger, in a split second [Jingzhou] was overturned to the ground, leaving [Ziyu] struggling to stand with shortness of breath.
0:33:42|0:34:0|[Ziyu] was seen going crazy, cutting off his arm and pushing his wife away to urge [Jingzhou] lying on the ground. Without waiting for him to stand firm, he rushed forward with a knife. Although [Ziyu] was disheveled and weak, his stance of leading the charge with a knife exuded a masculine aura, as if he was holding a long knife to pacify the chaotic world and establish his dominance over the land.
0:34:0|0:34:14|[Jingzhou] felt that all he could see was a murderous intent, knowing [Ziyu]'s determination at this moment. He resolutely placed the umbrella in front of him to face the force of [Ziyu]. The two of them moved and dodged, [Jingzhou] had made great progress, but he was still no match for the bamboo staff in [Ziyu]'s hands.
0:34:14|0:34:18|[Ziyu] found a flaw in the midst of the offensive and struck at the neck.
0:34:34|0:34:49|After he finished speaking, leaning on his cane and panting heavily, [Xiaoai] quickly stepped forward and, with great effort, supported [Ziyu]. Little did she know, he pushed himself away again and staggered behind [Jingzhou], leaning on his cane, and spoke.
0:35:19|0:35:27|[Jingzhou] knelt on the ground and received three strikes from [Ziyu]'s staff, but remained motionless.
0:35:37|0:35:56|His voice echoed in the cave, penetrating the thoughts of [Jingzhou]. The mountain wind and drizzle were as dense as silk, with the minds of the three master and servants each in their own thoughts. On the other side, for some unknown reason, [Pei Liang] hosted a banquet for the courtiers in the main hall, with silk and bamboo music placed in the hall, encountering fate and controlling the wind on paper.
0:35:56|0:36:16|The civil and military officials sat behind the stage, exchanging cups and dancing girls in blue clothes showed off their skills in front of the emperor. Pei Liang, on the other hand, was leisurely and relaxed, with a hint of drunkenness, swaying to the music on the huge paper in the hall. Behind him, Qing Ping poured herself a drink, sneering at the pretense of peace.
0:36:28|0:36:44|In the court, the civil officials were all flattering, while Tian Zhan and other generals remained silent, showing disdain in their eyes. Pei Liang, indifferent, casually wrote a character "Pei" with a brush, then turned to Qing Ping and said.
0:36:47|0:37:5|[Qing Ping] refused to answer, [Pei Liang] smiled and continued to admire the calligraphy, with a report to announce Lu Yan's entrance into the hall, waving his sleeves to dismiss the musicians and dancers, then hurriedly bowed before His Highness.
0:37:36|0:37:43|He did not entangle with [Qing Ping], nor did he explain to the officials. He pointed to [Jingzhou]. Both civil and military officials all looked towards [Jingzhou].
0:38:24|0:38:43|This statement was made in the court, causing chaos even among the civil officials, and the military commanders were even more furious. Your sister, the dignified Princess, is actually going to be a concubine to the son of an enemy general. The arrogance of [Yang Cang] and his son is evident.
0:39:31|0:39:47|Tian Zhan's remonstration failed, but he ended up being demoted to a commoner, shouting to drive away the eunuchs around him. He also took off his court cap and threw it to the ground. At this moment, with his back facing the court officials, [Pei Liang] looked particularly gloomy. Tian Zhan stepped back, grabbed his court robe haphazardly, and smashed it onto [Jingzhou] in anger, then left the seat.
0:39:53|0:40:19|[Pei Liang] remained silent, but unexpectedly Tian Zhan suddenly shouted loudly, then swiftly kicked and broke a screen frame beside him. [Pei Liang] turned around and gazed bitterly at Ying Ling, his face covered in dust that was hard to dissipate. He quickly stepped onto the platform, drew his bow and shot an arrow at the full moon. The arrow missed, but pierced into the gap between the blue bricks under Tian Zhan's feet. He then bent down to pull out the arrow.
0:40:21|0:40:38|In front of the civil and military officials, as the arrow pierced into his right chest staining his white robe with blood, [Pei Liang] let out a furious laugh, then he took the arrow from the pot, drew his bow and charged straight towards Tian Zhan. Just as he was about to kill him, he saw [Qing Ping] blocking his line of sight.
0:40:42|0:40:53|Upon hearing the words of Tian Zhan behind her and witnessing Pei Liang's actions in front of her, Qing Ping was furious. She pressed down the longbow in Pei Liang's hand and picked up the dagger that Yang Ping had given to Jingzhou, saying.
0:40:56|0:41:17|Shortly after, [Qing Ping] turned around menacingly with a dagger and left. The scene then shifted to the training ground in the city of [Jingzhou], where two men in black robes stood in the pouring rain, each wielding a large knife. One attacked with a long knife while the other calmly twisted the handle to deflect the attacks, and in a flash, the long knife in the opponent's hand was knocked to the ground.
0:41:18|0:41:39|The two individuals, one old and one young, are none other than [Yang Cang] and his son [Yang Ping]. [Yang Ping] picked up the long knife dropped by his father and walked to the opposite side of [Yang Cang]. Holding the knife handle against his chest and abdomen, he brandished the blade towards the sky and faced [Yang Cang] fearlessly in battle. His youthful vigor and swift movements impressed [Yang Cang], who leaned on his long knife and spoke.
0:42:1|0:42:9|After the martial arts competition, father and son stood under the solitary pavilion in the school field, watching as [Jingzhou] discussed the wind and clouds with [Pei Liang] in the dense rain.
0:44:22|0:44:28|[Ziyu] was lost in thought, repeating [Xiaoai]'s words softly while [Jingzhou] also glanced sideways with some consideration.
0:44:42|0:44:56|Therefore, [Xiaoai] arrived at the formation before [Jingzhou], holding the umbrella of [Pei Liang] on her shoulder, facing [Ziyu]. As she set up her posture, [Ziyu] attacked with a bamboo staff. [Xiaoai] remained calm and composed, advancing with the umbrella of [Pei Liang], showcasing the subtlety of a woman's movements with each step.
0:44:56|0:45:10|During the close combat, whenever Xiaoai and Pei Liang's umbrellas touched the bamboo staff, they were effortlessly deflected by the spinning motion. Ziyu, who deeply understood the essence of Tai Chi, was amazed and momentarily speechless. He looked at Xiaoai and said, "..."
0:45:16|0:45:50|After finishing speaking, Ziyu walked back to the formation and waited with his cane. Across from him, Xiaoai and Jingzhou locked eyes briefly before quickly looking away. Then, turning around and facing Ziyu, Jingzhou hesitated slightly while holding an umbrella outside the formation. Concerned about the relationship between master and servant, Ziyu spoke passionately, leaving Jingzhou feeling helpless. Jingzhou directly took the umbrella from Pei Liang's hand and walked towards Xiaoai, standing behind her. Although the two were under the same umbrella, there was still a gap between them. Ziyu couldn't contain his impatience and began to speak.
0:46:9|0:46:21|Then, with one hand supporting Xiaoai's soft body as they shook hands, and the other hand hooking around her slender waist, the sound of qin and se stirred. Ziyu, in a flowing black robe, swung the bamboo staff like a long knife, his gaze fierce like thunder, stepping out of the formation of Yuyang.
0:46:21|0:46:30|Watching [Xiaoai] and [Jingzhou] on the opposite side, their movements are in perfect harmony, like the snow on the Su Mountain. Dancing with the umbrella, [Pei Liang] moves like the flowing clouds, just like the gentle breeze, facing the overwhelming enemy forces.
0:46:32|0:46:51|The bamboo umbrellas connect as if thunder striking the wind and clouds. Even with supreme power, if it is lost like flowing clouds and water, it is as insignificant as stepping on a goose feather. Mastering the void, it seems like the void is full of energy, but there is no response, making people frustrated. In an instant, the three combinations are brought together, [Ziyu] does not dare to slack off, directly using [Yang Cang]'s move to injure himself.
0:46:51|0:47:11|The oil-paper umbrella surface was split by force, while the bamboo staff was bound by the umbrella ribs, making it difficult to pull away. [Xiaoai] manipulated the umbrella skillfully, swirling the bamboo staff like river waves. Her movements, resembling the powerful Yang Family Sword Technique, turned the combined forces of the umbrella and staff into her own. She shook the bamboo staff out of [Ziyu]'s hand, causing it to fall outside the formation.
0:47:26|0:47:33|Ziyu lay on the damp ground, and Xiaoai hurried to help him up.
0:47:45|0:47:51|[Ziyu] sat up and leaned under [Xiaoai]'s umbrella to speak.
0:47:55|0:48:3|[Jingzhou] responded with a sound and then left the cave through a dangerous passage. [Xiaoai] looked around with her eyes, and it took a while before she could tear herself away from the departing figure of [Jingzhou].
0:48:32|0:48:52|Seeing [Ziyu] with such an attitude, [Xiaoai] frowned slightly and looked flustered. The scene then shifts to a bamboo forest, where raindrops fall delicately on the rugged rocks, and a figure in the distance approaches following the sound of the flute. He is dressed in a robe, his true appearance difficult to discern among the bamboo and rocks. Following the sound leads to a low stone forest.
0:48:52|0:49:11|A man dressed in a black robe, wearing a bamboo hat, sat on a rock. It was [Jingzhou]. He looked up, revealing his face. It turned out to be the warrior who had caused a scene in the court, General Tian Zhan, who was furious but retreated, slowly approaching and standing opposite [Jingzhou], listening quietly to the sound of the flute.
0:49:19|0:49:27|[Jingzhou] remained silent, placing the ancient flute on his knee and gazing into the depths of the bamboo forest, then turned to ask Tian Zhan.
0:50:6|0:50:20|Upon hearing the words from [Jingzhou], Tian Zhan turned back in confusion and looked at him. Without much explanation, [Jingzhou] led him back to the Governor's Mansion to avoid the servants, and directly showed Tian Zhan how to open the entrance to the secret chamber.
0:50:20|0:50:32|It seems that after Ziyu caused a scene in the court, he regarded Tian Zhan as his own ally. Without Ziyu's signal, Jingzhou would never dare to reveal the secret mechanism of the fighting room to others at that time.
0:50:32|0:50:56|[Jingzhou] sent Tian Zhan into the secret passage and stood guard in the inner room. Tian Zhan groped his way through the narrow passage and finally entered the dark cave. As he pushed the door open, he saw a frail figure hunched over in the dimly lit cave. In front of a crack where a faint light shone through, the person slowly turned around. It was none other than the ailing [Ziyu].
0:51:2|0:51:8|Ziyu looked at Tian Zhan kneeling on the ground, his eyes fixed on him for a while before nodding slightly and saying.
0:52:59|0:53:7|Tian Zhan watched as [Ziyu] trembled while lifting the teapot, quickly reaching out to take it into his own hands to pour tea for the commander, then spoke.
0:53:43|0:53:49|Tian Zhan bowed apologetically, but little did he know that [Ziyu] would gently pat his fist with the palm of his hand and say softly.
0:54:36|0:55:3|Tian Zhan was surprised to find that Ziyu had long harbored rebellious intentions. The boldness he displayed earlier was just a temporary expedient. The reason he kept Pei Liang around was simply to make the most of him. Leaving the arena, Tian Zhan walked out of the secret passage, carefully closing the hidden door. Turning around, he saw Jingzhou bowing solemnly, standing behind the screen. In the dimly lit Governor's Mansion, illuminated by moonlight, Tian Zhan's gaze kept wandering on Jingzhou's face.
0:55:3|0:55:9|He then bypassed the screen and came to [Jingzhou], carefully examining, while [Jingzhou] lowered his head and nodded.
0:55:11|0:55:21|Tian Zhan did not answer, but just shifted his gaze away from [Jingzhou]'s face, continuing to roam over his figure. After a while, he pursed his lips, shook his head, and then slowly spoke with emotion.
0:55:30|0:55:55|Tian Zhan nodded slowly, agreeing to what Jingzhou had said. The camera then shifted to a deep bamboo forest, where the 100 death row prisoners mentioned earlier were standing with bamboo poles, their faces showing varying degrees of malice, but all eyes were focused on Tian Zhan holding Pei Liang's umbrella.
0:55:55|0:56:12|At this moment, he took the opportunity to fight with a dead prisoner to teach others how to restrain [Pei Liang] and his soft knife skills against [Yang Cang]. After defeating the dead prisoner, Tian Zhan looked at everyone and shouted in the bamboo forest.
0:57:11|0:57:30|Qing Ping now realizes that Pei Liang has been hiding his feelings for many years. As a mere daughter, she is heartbroken by her brother Yang Ping's promise to her. Meanwhile, in a secret room, the three master and servants are plotting together, all except Xiaoai appear to be drunk.
0:57:31|0:57:38|[Ziyu] is about to get what he wants, so he swallows the jade and enjoys it to the fullest.
0:58:15|0:58:22|[Jingzhou] heard these words and felt a little guilty. He glanced at [Xiaoai], then quickly moved away, took a sip of wine and said.
0:58:29|0:58:57|Hearing Ziyu's emotional words, Jingzhou dared not ask, only watching him pour and drink, intoxicated. As the banquet ended, Jingzhou was about to leave when Ziyu, barely standing with Xiaoai's support, managed to say these four words. Jingzhou solemnly bowed outside the cave entrance, then walked back to the inner room with Xiaoai.
0:58:57|0:59:9|Ziyu and Jingzhou sat cross-legged between the bed, two maids finished arranging the bedding and then left with a bow, everything seemed as usual, proper and uneventful.
0:59:12|0:59:18|[Jingzhou] spoke softly, different from before. [Xiaoai] lowered her head and nodded, asking in a soft voice.
0:59:57|1:0:7|[Jingzhou] only spoke a few words, but [Xiaoai] had already teared up, it was the moment of parting that brought out deep emotions and expressions in their eyes.
1:0:18|1:0:34|[Jingzhou] stood firm and met the tender gaze of [Xiaoai]. As their eyes locked, the two remained speechless for a long time. Avoiding [Jingzhou]'s intense gaze, [Xiaoai] lowered her head and let out a long sigh.
1:0:44|1:0:59|[Xiaoai] tears rolled down the delicate fuzz at the bottom of her eyes, looking pitiful under the moonlight. On the other side, [Jingzhou] also had red eyes, looking at [Xiaoai] with a complex gaze, hoping she would say something.
1:0:59|1:1:13|However, [Xiaoai] just kept crying without any intention of speaking. After a moment of silence, [Jingzhou] stood up facing [Xiaoai], with tears still wet on his nose bridge. His eyes were filled with restraint and reluctance as he looked at [Xiaoai].
1:1:18|1:1:25|After a word of thanks, [Jingzhou] bowed deeply to [Xiaoai], then walked out of the room under the mottled moonlight.
1:1:25|1:1:50|Beside the bed, [Xiaoai] was already in tears, looking in the direction where [Jingzhou] had left, unable to come back to her senses for a long time. As the night grew deeper, on the blue stone floor of the Governor's Mansion, a pair of slender and delicate bare feet moved gracefully, with a fair and tender skin, like white camels supporting red silk, those were a woman's jade feet, lightly and carefully moving swiftly, silently swirling the hem of her skirt.
1:1:50|1:2:8|Through the screen, [Xiaoai] appeared in the main hall of the mansion with graceful figure, quietly entering the dim light inside the mansion like a light veil. The hidden passage, [Ziyu], lifted a corner of the broken bricks and stones in the corner, revealing a small hole connecting to the inner room.
1:2:8|1:2:18|In the crevice, a faint light seeped through, while the room was dimly lit. [Ziyu], hunched over, appeared even more gloomy with the interplay of light and shadow on his body, as he peered through the small hole.
1:2:18|1:2:36|Watching as [Xiaoai] barefoot searches for [Jingzhou] in the hall, it becomes clear that ever since being imprisoned in the fighting room, [Jingzhou] and [Xiaoai] have been completely under the surveillance of [Ziyu]. Like a worm expeller, [Ziyu] twists his body to adjust his angle, eager to know the purpose of [Xiaoai]'s visit.
1:2:36|1:3:1|Outside, the bed of [Jingzhou] was empty. Startled, [Xiaoai] frantically searched around and in the corner of the screen, she saw [Jingzhou] curled up and shivering. [Xiaoai] was both surprised and heartbroken, looking at [Jingzhou] as if he had fallen into a nightmare from childhood, panicked and helpless. She couldn't help but bend down, gently placing her hand on [Jingzhou]'s shoulder.
1:3:2|1:3:18|Sensing someone approaching from behind, [Jingzhou] suddenly turned around and sat up, with a fierce and fearful expression on his face. After seeing the person clearly, he slowly calmed his breath, with a hint of doubt and excitement, leaning against the screen and looking towards [Xiaoai] as if in a dream.
1:3:18|1:3:35|[Jingzhou] saw [Xiaoai] slowly approaching, and even lifted the embroidered handkerchief to cover his cheeks, soft like a dragonfly touching the water, with a heart as calm as water ripples. [Jingzhou] had never seen [Xiaoai] so gentle before, as if in an instant, his whole body was immersed in warm spring water, soaking his flesh into red fragrant mud.
1:3:35|1:3:52|The two are now intimately close, with one secretly spitting out orchids, causing confusion in the heart of [Jingzhou]. Then [Xiaoai] uses her arms as a pillow, embracing the reflection in her arms, gentle like a hero, feeling the softness of the delicate body in front of her, [Jingzhou] completely succumbs without resistance.
1:3:52|1:4:8|Sniffing the warmth in [Xiaoai]'s arms, inhaling the fragrance of orchids and musk from the jade-like lips. [Jingzhou] gently strokes the exposed chest and kisses the fair neck amidst the chaos. The two have long been immersed in the sweetness, where distinctions of status and societal norms are all cast aside, leaving only the entanglement of love and affection.
1:4:8|1:4:26|The intense desire colludes and infiltrates the mind and body. [Jingzhou] uses his lips to capture the delicate and tender body, while [Xiaoai]'s red lips gently explore the cleverness, just like a night of river cruise listening to the spring rain, not merely a simple act. [Jingzhou]'s warm and powerful hands are now firmly on [Xiaoai]'s jade neck.
1:4:26|1:4:47|The brief separation of lips and teeth was unbearable for [Jingzhou], he disregarded everything and met [Xiaoai] with a shallow embrace, feeling the magnificence of the man's lips. [Xiaoai] also became more immersed, her bright eyes dimming gradually, becoming increasingly hazy. The dim light and candlelight intertwined, spreading the spring scenery through the screen in the mansion.
1:4:47|1:4:55|Watching the intertwining of spirits and flesh between the two, [Ziyu] had a complex expression on his face in the dim light. The fleeting night of passion quickly passed, and the scene shifted to [Jingzhou].
1:5:0|1:5:13|In the lonely pavilion of the training ground, [Yang Cang] sat on a horse stool, sipping tea to rest. His son [Yang Ping] stood aside, listening to the messenger reporting. With a glance exchanged between father and son, they then changed into armor and led the soldiers to rush to the city gate of [Jingzhou].
1:5:13|1:5:43|[Jingzhou] is nestled among the mountains, surrounded by rivers and perched on a treacherous terrain. There is only one narrow pass, stretching between two steep peaks, wide enough for only four warships to pass side by side. Given such a perilous situation, it's no wonder that [Yang Cang] only left eight hundred soldiers and dared to claim that no one could break through the city gates of [Jingzhou]. Looking around, one could see two moving pavilions within the peaks, carrying a massive object. It was a platform made of bamboo poles, adorned with the Yin-Yang Bagua diagram, mirroring the battle formation in the secret chamber of the mansion.
1:5:43|1:5:54|Amid the exclamations of the guards in Jingzhou, the bamboo platform approached the city gate of Jingzhou, completely ignoring the underwater pitfalls.
1:6:2|1:6:26|Within the city gates, the soldiers are clad in black armor, wielding long knives, all trained in the Yang Family's swordsmanship. The eight hundred defenders in the city are all young soldiers from the Yang Family. On the pavilion, Jingzhou is dressed in plain clothes, wearing a bamboo hat and carrying Pei Liang on his back. Looking up, Yang Cang gazes at the swaying rain as if it were nothing, then lets out a shout.
1:6:35|1:6:40|Yang Ping stared at Jingzhou and the Yin-Yang Tai Chi diagram for a while before speaking.
1:7:23|1:7:43|Then he swung his long knife and walked down the city gate, arriving at the opposite platform. [Jingzhou] turned the mechanism on the platform, causing the electric bamboo bridge to fall under the steps of Chongguan, right at [Yang Cang]'s feet. The precision of the river crossing plan was evident.
1:7:43|1:8:9|The intertwining sounds echoed beneath the platform, coming from the two warships. In the dark hold of the ship, among the two warships, were [Tian Zhan] and the 100 death row prisoners. Apart from wearing armor on their backs, they all carried weapons, standing in formation, ready. Feeling the warship beneath their feet gradually stabilizing, as soon as they heard the loud noise of the bamboo bridge touching the city gate above their heads, [Tian Zhan] slowly stood up, ordered to open the hatch at the bottom of the ship to reveal the river water, and then waved his hand to give a quiet command.
1:8:9|1:8:21|The condemned prisoners, apart from their weapons, also have three bamboo tubes strapped to their backs with leather for storing oxygen. They are seen biting on the breathing tubes connected to the bamboo tubes, jumping into the water one by one, showing no fear.
1:8:21|1:8:53|In the crowd, [Tian Zhan] spotted a figure he was extremely familiar with. Before [Tian Zhan] could shout to stop her, [Qing Ping] had already disappeared into the icy river. On the other side, [Yang Cang] was dressed in armor, with a tiger-head helmet on his shoulder, high boots on his feet, and a long knife in his hand as he stepped onto the platform. Little did he know that at that moment, [Tian Zhan] was leading a hundred death row prisoners into the river, taking advantage of the continuous rainy weather to break through the Chongguan underwater passage.
1:8:53|1:9:0|Enter the city of [Jingzhou]. Without much talk on the platform, the two of them step into the Tai Chi diagram, each taking a stance and facing each other.
1:9:1|1:9:12|Yang Cang gazed at [Jingzhou] without speaking, then raised his knife and stood on the platform, waiting quietly for his actions. Just by hearing the sound, one could tell that Yang Cang's knife was as heavy as ten thousand catties, truly extraordinary.
1:9:13|1:9:32|On the other hand, [Jingzhou] took the burden of Pei umbrella, removed the ropes, pressed the top of the hangar, and unfolded one after another, a total of forty-eight diamond blades embedded in front of him, twisting and turning, shining like a wind-cutting and rain-extinguishing umbrella surface, extremely sharp. [Yang Cang] also glanced at it.
1:9:36|1:9:50|[Jingzhou] displayed his stance, [Yang Cang] stood with a long knife in hand. After a light laugh, he swung the knife with full force, as if it had a spirit. With a buzzing sound, [Jingzhou] shook his shoulder, twisted the straight handle of the umbrella on his shoulder, and three sharp blades shot out, forcing [Yang Cang], who was about to engage in close combat, to stop and defend with his knife.
1:9:51|1:10:24|When [Jingzhou] and a woman entered with graceful steps, [Yang Cang] felt ashamed and angry, ready to attack with his sword. However, the woman used a golden oil to dissolve the attack, with the sharp blade pressing against his throat for a moment. The brief exchange ended with [Jingzhou] slightly gaining the upper hand. Both then retreated to their positions, on guard. [Yang Cang] also put away his arrogance.
1:10:24|1:10:43|At the same time, in the sewer, Tian Zhan led a hundred death row prisoners to finally sneak into the city of [Jingzhou]. The rain poured down heavily, the sound of water deep within the city, and no one noticed the slight noise coming from the waterway. Tian Zhan raised his hand, moved the blue stone cover aside, and led the crowd onto the streets of [Jingzhou].
1:10:43|1:10:54|The condemned prisoners were on guard while the passersby were armed with weapons. At this moment, [Qing Ping] also crawled out from the waterway, her face and body covered in filth, no longer showing any trace of princess-like demeanor.
1:10:54|1:11:10|Over a hundred people, all looking disheveled, yet unable to hide the aura of death on them, the group of death row prisoners, armed with crossbows, followed Tian Zhan as they crouched and made their way to the main street of [Jingzhou] city. Taking advantage of the sound of rain and the mist to avoid being seen, they bypassed the blind spot of the arrow tower.
1:11:10|1:11:28|Tian Zhan waved his arm to signal everyone to stop, then raised his hand forward with [Qing Ping], and four cold lights suddenly appeared from the double crossbows. The Yan Kingdom soldiers guarding the arrow tower were instantly killed and fell to the ground. Just as Tian Zhan's surprise attack was starting to take effect, the situation on [Jingzhou]'s side was not optimistic.
1:11:28|1:11:40|In their second encounter, Ziyu sparred with Yang Cang countless times, but still couldn't harm him at all, feeling like he was in a dangerous situation. Finally, he was accidentally cut on the chest by the long knife. After that, Yang Cang turned around and walked back into the formation.
1:11:43|1:11:51|After Jingzhou finished cooking in the city and guarding the sword tower, someone took Pei Liang from his hand, and a handle was turned upside down on the ground and then grabbed.
1:11:51|1:12:10|A shield held in front of the body, with bamboo from the city used as support and connected by ropes, set up a slingshot and lay among [Pei Liang], the umbrella surface closed up and down, resembling golden waves, [Yang Ping] and the others were all like this.
1:12:10|1:12:24|When the people under the umbrella are ready, several death row prisoners exerted their strength to bend the tough bamboo and pull the rope of [Pei Liang], using the slippery rainwater to rotate up and down the umbrella surface, rushing towards the city gate from the main road in the city.
1:12:25|1:12:43|[Jingzhou] The city guards were puzzled by the appearance of these golden wave-like figures, and in their confusion, sounded the alarm. After the signal was given, a large number of soldiers in black armor with longbows appeared on the main road, under the eaves of the rain-soaked tiles. As Tian Zhan and others approached, the soldiers bent their bows and shot, filling the air with a sudden rain of arrows.
1:12:43|1:13:0|However, Tian Zhan and others used the diamond-like blade of [Pei Liang] as a shield. Few of the defending soldiers could hit the bullseye from a hundred paces and shoot arrows into the gaps. On the other hand, half of the death row prisoners hid among [Pei Liang], using Zhuge's first crossbow to shoot countless defending soldiers with short swords, sending chills down everyone's spine.
1:13:0|1:13:13|Time has passed, and there have been casualties, but compared to the soldiers of the Yan Kingdom, the difference is far greater. Especially when facing 800 soldiers from the Yang family with just over a hundred death row prisoners, they defended the city of [Jingzhou], a historic stronghold, which is truly unprecedented.
1:13:14|1:13:45|If we can really take down the city gate of [Jingzhou], it may not be a feat that will go down in history, but it will definitely be a remarkable achievement. Upon hearing this, [Yang Ping] had a drastic change in expression, immediately leading troops to reinforce. Facing [Yang Ping] in the field of battle, he did not show any fear, calmly giving orders and shouting loudly. Following his lead, everyone together held up [Pei Liang] above their heads, with both hands gripping the handle of the umbrella mechanism.
1:13:46|1:14:6|Under Tian Zhan's command, everyone launched a row of flying blades, then crouched down and launched another row, repeating this process. Seeing this, Yang Ping, who was leading the charge, also ordered his subordinates to wield their swords for defense. After a round of simultaneous shooting, the invincible Yang family army suffered several casualties. Yang Ping felt heartbroken, but had no choice but to lead the soldiers to continue the charge.
1:14:6|1:14:21|Just now, as he rushed forward, he saw the crowd on the opposite side carrying umbrellas on their shoulders, moving forward like a woman, with a graceful and agile demeanor. Princess Chang recognized [Yang Ping], her eyes widened in anger and she shouted, then she quickly rushed forward.
1:14:21|1:14:34|[Yang Ping] still doesn't understand the subtleties of Pei San's tactics. In the confrontation with [Qing Ping], he unexpectedly suffered losses, leaving him with nowhere to vent his anger. The forces of Yan and Pei are entangled within the city, while the battle of the main generals outside the city has also reached a critical juncture.
1:14:35|1:14:45|In the third round of the battle, Yang Cang did exactly as Ziyu had predicted and used the upward sword technique, while Jingzhou countered with the umbrella technique learned from Xiaoai. The sword was thrown into the umbrella, harnessing the power of Cang's sword.
1:14:45|1:14:57|Twisting his body to move the umbrella, the long knife slipped out of Yang Cang's hand, fighting as Ziyu expected to this point, only to find that Yang Cang still had the strength for one more battle, flying to retrieve the weapon and swinging it towards Jingzhou.
1:14:57|1:15:6|At this moment, suspended in mid-air, [Jingzhou] had no way to avoid the force of the sword and could only take a blow from [Yang Cang]. His thigh was cut, blood flowing freely, a desperate situation.
1:15:25|1:15:32|[Jingzhou] looked up and saw the flag of the Yang family army still standing on the pass, knowing that the fighting in the city was not over yet, and spoke.
1:15:42|1:15:54|[Yang Cang] saw that he was unwilling to accept the offer, feeling greatly regretful in his heart. He picked up his long knife and walked back to the formation, preparing for the next move. The outcome of the battle between the main generals was still uncertain, but as [Ziyu] had predicted, the city was already at the final critical moment.
1:15:54|1:16:13|A death row prisoner swung his umbrella and roared at the military flag, but unfortunately failed to damage it even a bit. He was then killed with a single slash by [Yang Ping] who flew over. Seeing this, the Princess quickly rotated her umbrella to shoot knives, but all were dodged by [Yang Ping]. In a moment of panic, she was struck across the chest by [Yang Ping]'s horizontal slash.
1:16:13|1:16:29|Enduring the pain in her chest and abdomen, Princess Chang continued to fight against [Yang Ping]. However, the two were vastly mismatched in martial arts skills. In a moment, Princess Chang was injured again by a kick from [Yang Ping], relying on a rock for support to catch her breath. At this critical moment, [Tian Zhan] stepped in to rescue her, engaging in a fierce battle with [Yang Ping].
1:16:29|1:16:51|At this moment, he was also at the end of his strength, relying solely on the determination to win as he swung his fists and feet, challenging [Yang Ping] on horseback with every punch landing on his body. He was beaten to a pulp, but unexpectedly, [Yang Ping] felt a weapon within reach, grasping the blade and stabbing it directly into the lower back of [Tian Zhan]. The intense pain struck, causing the already bloodied and defeated [Tian Zhan] to be unable to bear it and faint. The Princess Consort quickly rushed forward with an umbrella, engaging in another fierce battle with [Yang Ping].
1:16:51|1:17:3|[Yang Ping] took up his weapon, letting the Princess chase after him. He dragged the blade on the ground, splashing countless blood. Seeing the Princess leaping into the air, he knew the timing was right, and he delivered a powerful upward strike to her waist and abdomen.
1:17:5|1:17:23|The body lies in an endless sea of corpses, blood flowing from the blade, truly displaying extreme dominance. Struck by this blade, Princess Ziyu falls to the ground, her long hair scattered, rain washing away the blood on her face, revealing her original gentle features. At this moment, she is no longer able to fight, lying on the ground with blood flowing profusely.
1:17:23|1:17:31|[Yang Ping] saw the situation and picked up his sword, also covered in blood and panting heavily. He looked at the revealed face of the princess and sarcastically spoke out in confusion.
1:17:44|1:18:7|Then Yang Ping approached the Princess slowly, squatted down and said, recalling the words of the woman in front of him. It was then that Yang Ping realized that this person was the younger sister of the Lord of Pei, Qing Ping, who almost became his concubine, the Princess of the enemy country.
1:18:8|1:18:24|Just as he leaned in to listen, the Princess suddenly pulled out the dagger given by [Yang Ping], and with all her strength, she stabbed it into his neck. With a muffled groan from [Yang Ping], the Princess forcefully pulled out the dagger, only to see blood gushing out like a spring, beyond saving.
1:18:25|1:18:34|Within moments, [Yang Ping] bled to death, while on the other side, the Princess Consort also lost the strength to hold the weapon in her hand, dropping the sword to the ground with a smile before passing away.
1:18:35|1:18:49|The scene shifts to the Governor's Mansion, where [Xiaoai] is lying against the wall leading to the secret chamber, feeling for something. Moving into the secret chamber, [Xiaoai] quietly looks back towards the depths of the cave to confirm no movement before turning back to flip over the broken stones and tiles on the wall.
1:18:50|1:19:1|After some fiddling, she finally discovered the crevice that Ziyu had been using to spy, Xiaoai couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat. Looking out through the crack, the entire inner courtyard was in full view.
1:19:2|1:19:7|Upon reflection, he knew that the scene of the secret meeting with [Jingzhou] last night had already entered [Ziyu]'s eyes.
1:19:8|1:19:23|Once thought to be a man above tens of thousands with extraordinary demeanor, Ziyu, turned into a strange man who imprisoned himself in a fighting room to spy on his wife after a year or so.
1:19:38|1:19:57|Sensing that Ziyu's questioning had a hidden meaning, Xiaoai did not avoid or retreat. The words she spoke were also ambiguous. As someone who had spent a year setting up this big picture, how could Ziyu not hear the implications in Xiaoai's words? He repeatedly took heavy breaths as he stepped in front of Xiaoai, his gaze coldly fixed on his own wife, remaining silent for a long time.
1:20:2|1:20:15|It was Xiaoai who spoke first. The so-called harmony in music and hearts resonating, Xiaoai also wanted to take the opportunity of playing together to explore Ziyu's current concerns.
1:20:15|1:20:34|The couple sat in the center of the Yin-Yang formation, each holding a qin or se, with [Xiaoai] taking the lead in plucking the strings. The music sounded natural, the sword blade fierce, mirroring the struggles in their hearts. On the other side, [Ziyu] scattered his hair like a storm, playing the strings like a warrior, the music dark and chilling.
1:20:34|1:20:48|In the depths of the secluded cave, two people harmonized on the zither and flute, their hearts swaying with the music, intertwining in each other's hearts. As the music deepened, [Ziyu] still wore a look of madness on his face, while [Xiaoai]'s gaze became more complex.
1:20:48|1:20:56|During the harmonious music performance and the day when the strong crossbows were put away, the battle for the chief position on the Taiji platform ended with [Jingzhou] losing.
1:20:56|1:21:9|In the pouring rain, Tian Zhan woke up and saw the bodies of Princess Chang and [Yang Ping] in front of him. Drenched in the rain, he looked at the two blood-stained corpses, feeling indescribable in his heart. After a while, he let out a loud cry.
1:21:29|1:21:41|In the city, the death row prisoner Yu Li is still shouting loudly, trying to disrupt the enemy's morale. He clings to the wooden stake attached to the military flag, falls from the cliff corner of Shuncheng Pass, and lands heavily on the platform below.
1:21:44|1:21:49|Upon hearing the farewell words "As long as the flag stands, the man remains", [Yang Cang] knew that his son had died in battle.
1:21:49|1:22:5|He roared in anger and threw his long knife, intending to kill [Jingzhou] on the spot. Dodging the knife, [Jingzhou] got up and continued to fight with [Yang Cang]. At this moment, [Yang Cang] fought bare-handed, but with a heart full of anger and strong martial arts skills, he suppressed [Jingzhou] so that he couldn't lift his head.
1:22:5|1:22:28|Ziyu forcefully snatched Pei Liang from Jingzhou's hands, then threw him to the ground. Just as he was about to continue his brutal attack on Jingzhou, he was stabbed in the abdomen by the last page umbrella blade. Yang Cang, in pain and uncontrollably angry, kicked Jingzhou, sending him flying and crashing onto the broken bamboo platform. A slender bamboo pole pierced deeply into Jingzhou's lower back, causing unbearable pain. Yang Cang, at this point, had gone completely insane.
1:22:28|1:22:39|The armor was scattered, with a weapon at the waist and blood flowing profusely. He grabbed [Jingzhou] by the neck, intending to kill him in front of everyone. He reluctantly drew the sword from his waist, raised it high, and was about to strike down.
1:22:39|1:22:49|[Jingzhou] fought to resist [Yang Cang]'s arm with his last breath, leading to a stalemate. [Yang Cang] was determined to avenge his son, ignoring the pain and using all his strength to press the blade down.
1:22:49|1:23:3|At the critical moment of life and death, [Jingzhou] remained calm, using the flexibility of the handle provided by [Pei Liang] to flick the blade, cutting open [Yang Cang]'s throat directly. A fierce general like him should not die in battle, but instead exhausted in hand-to-hand combat, a tragic and lamentable end.
1:23:3|1:23:11|[Yang Cang] reached out and flipped onto the Tai Chi platform, taking a deep breath in the mirror, enduring the severe pain in his lower back, and pulling himself away from the bamboo pole.
1:23:13|1:23:31|After this life-and-death battle, [Jingzhou] was covered in wounds, blood staining his broken body, his clothes tattered and unable to cover him. Nevertheless, [Jingzhou] still looked up at the pouring rain, laughing towards the sky. As the fierce battle came to an end, the husband and wife in the fighting room finally finished their music performance.
1:23:31|1:23:37|Xiaoai's face was full of astonishment, as if she had heard some cruel plans from Ziyu's music.
1:23:37|1:24:3|Time flies, and as night falls, in the deep alleys of Jingzhou city, [Jingzhou] sits on a horse, unable to tend to his wounds. Relying on his memories, he wanders on the way home. Pausing by a stone bridge, memories deep within him seem to stir. Dismounting, he walks towards the old house ahead. The deeper he goes into Jingzhou, the more convinced he is that this is the place he has been longing for, his hometown that has haunted him for over a decade.
1:24:3|1:24:9|He walked unsteadily in the alley, desperately trying to retrieve the memories about this in the depths of his mind.
1:24:9|1:24:35|Walking into a deserted courtyard, rainwater dripped from the eaves, sometimes converging into threads, sometimes condensing into clusters, just like the current state of [Jingzhou]'s troubled and disorderly thoughts. Pushing open the door into the dark room, gently lifting the tattered door curtain, a lonely elderly woman with white hair lying on the bed could be seen in the mirror. He walked to the bedside with his own hands and feet, silently squatting down to observe the old woman's weathered figure.
1:24:35|1:24:43|[Jingzhou] felt a deep sense of sorrow and anger in his heart. He moistened his eyes and reached out to gently pull the old woman's shoulder, causing his mother to turn around.
1:24:43|1:24:57|The first thing that caught Ziyu's eyes was a dagger deeply embedded in his mother's chest. The blood at the wound had already dried up, and his mother's face showed no signs of fear. Ziyu's eyes widened in anger and he let out a loud cry.
1:24:58|1:25:17|As soon as the words fell, a flying knife broke through the window, followed by a dark figure rushing towards him. [Jingzhou] blocked the flying knife with his arm, then quickly dodged the attack of the dark figure. As he stood up again, three men in black surrounded him in the narrow room. [Jingzhou] glared fiercely, ignoring the pain.
1:25:17|1:25:25|Pulling a throwing knife directly from his wrist, [Ziyu] clenched it in his hand, his eyes widened as he looked around at the three assassins nearby, and said,
1:25:35|1:25:57|However, the assassin did not explain and attacked with a long sword. [Jingzhou], already at the end of his strength, witnessed his mother's death at home. With sheer determination, he managed to kill one assassin, but left himself vulnerable to the other two. The two assassins then kicked him together, sending [Jingzhou] flying through a wooden board and crashing to the ground. The two assassins continued to press forward, giving [Jingzhou] no chance to catch his breath.
1:25:57|1:26:23|Finally, they each thrust their long swords into the ribs and waist of [Jingzhou], pinning him to the wall. Just as the two assassins were about to finish off [Jingzhou], a sudden noise came from behind them. In an instant, the two assassins were found dead on the ground with their throats slit, the sound of blood gushing incessantly. [Jingzhou] couldn't even see the rescuer's face clearly, only sensing a flash of sword light breaking the deadlock. Removing the weapon from his shoulder, [Jingzhou] looked at the person hidden behind the curtain.
1:26:39|1:26:43|If you believe what this person says, it means that the three assassins were sent by [Ziyu].
1:26:56|1:27:4|In the pouring rain, soldier [Pei Liang] is stationed in the city of [Jingzhou], calling out alone in search of his sister [Qing Ping].
1:27:40|1:28:0|Pei Liang took the dagger, looked at the bloodstains on it with a sad expression, then angrily threw it to the ground, feeling a sense of regret and sorrow. He was filled with remorse, knowing that it was too late to repent for the departed.
1:28:0|1:28:15|With a long roar from [Pei Liang], the scene shifts to the grand hall of the Kingdom of Pei, where the same gathering of officials is seen celebrating. However, this time [Pei Liang] is seated on the throne, dressed in a black robe and wearing a nine-pronged crown, looking solemn.
1:28:15|1:28:32|Beside him, four jade thrones were bestowed upon Tian Zhan, Lu Yan, and [Xiaoai], each holding their own position. The seat between [Pei Liang] and [Xiaoai] remained unoccupied, watching the courtiers enjoy the music and dance. Gracefully, [Pei Liang] tapped the seat and then raised his cup.
1:28:32|1:28:36|When all the officials' eyes were on him, [Pei Liang] remained expressionless and slowly said
1:29:1|1:29:15|Hearing Pei Liang's words, Xiaoai knew that Jingzhou was not completely at peace in death. On the other side, three soldiers clad in armor and with evil iron masks covering their faces stormed into the Commander's Mansion, ready to kill anyone who dared to stand in their way.
1:29:15|1:29:23|Entering the inner courtyard, it seemed as if there was no one there. The three of them were highly skilled in martial arts, definitely not opponents that the household guards of the Governor's Mansion could match.
1:29:23|1:29:35|Two of them distracted the obstacles in the mansion, while one of them came to the wall where the secret chamber was located and felt around a bit, then opened the secret door. When there was no more resistance in the mansion, they entered the narrow and dangerous secret passage.
1:29:35|1:29:50|Three people with double swords in hand arrived at the entrance of the cave, but just as they were about to push the door to enter, a long sword stabbed out along the door crack, directly piercing the throat of the middle soldier. Then the door of the mansion opened, and [Ziyu] stood with a long sword ready to meet the challenge.
1:29:53|1:30:4|The soldier presented the jade pendant and said, then rushed forward to fight with [Ziyu]. This group of people was sent by [Pei Liang] to kill him in the fighting room. However, [Ziyu] had planned everything out, but did not know that the lord had already been prepared.
1:30:13|1:30:24|In the court, a eunuch hurriedly ran in and reported to His Majesty. [Pei Liang] then showed a hint of joy, stood up to greet, and all the civil and military officials stood up, bowing towards the outside of the main hall.
1:30:24|1:30:40|[Xiaoai] also stood up in a panic, looking at the door with deep thoughts. Only to see [Jingzhou] entering the main hall, still wearing the blood-stained blue cloth with holes, his body showing signs of injury, walking unsteadily, slowly approaching [Pei Liang]. Civil and military officials, musicians and dancers all bowed and greeted him.
1:30:40|1:31:3|[Xiaoai] looked at [Jingzhou]'s appearance and clothing, knowing that yesterday's battle must have been extremely fierce. Unable to contain her emotions, she felt heartbroken. [Jingzhou] came to His Highness with a pensive look, gazing at [Pei Liang] for a long time. Then, he suddenly examined the two men, Tian Zhan and Lu Yan, who were covered in rain and blood stains, before they knelt down in difficulty and weakness, saying:
1:31:14|1:31:30|[Jingzhou] endured the pain, supported himself with the floor, slowly got up, and walked towards the empty seat next to [Xiaoai]. The civil and military officials glanced over, as they seemed to have never seen the current Grand Marshal in such a miserable state. [Jingzhou] didn't care, as he had experienced great sorrow and joy overnight, and had long been numb.
1:31:30|1:31:46|Choosing to return to [Pei State] was also because there were still mysteries in his heart that needed to be solved. In addition, the presence of [Xiaoai] was also a major reason he couldn't let go of [Pei State]. As he walked to Lady's side, he took off his hat, threw it aside, and then sat down, looking at [Xiaoai] and said slowly.
1:31:53|1:31:59|Lu Yan saw the two finish their conversation and felt the hall was a bit stuffy, so he stood up and raised his cup.
1:32:19|1:32:33|Although not knowing what [Pei Liang] meant, but unable to defy the imperial decree, the officials rose and took their leave in confusion. In the hall, [Pei Liang] waved his hand, stopping [Jingzhou] and [Xiaoai] who were also preparing to leave, indicating for them to remain seated and not to depart.
1:32:33|1:32:57|Watching Lu Yan, who left nervously, [Pei Liang] called him back, and Lu Yan stopped and stood in front of him, bowing and waiting. After a moment of contemplation, Tian Zhanlue understood the intention of the lord, and then left the main hall. Lu Yan seemed to have concerns, standing in the hall, no longer as relaxed as before.
1:32:57|1:33:4|As the palace gates closed, [Pei Liang] walked slowly towards Lord Lu Yan with a bowl of imperial wine in hand, and spoke.
1:33:45|1:33:58|At the moment when Lu Yan was speechless, [Pei Liang] flashed his knife and sealed the throat with a sword, killing him in the hall. It was only then that it was known that the father and son [Yang Cang] could sense any movement as soon as it happened, and this sentence was referring to Lu Yan.
1:33:58|1:34:11|Watching the treacherous man lying on the ground gasping for breath, [Pei Liang] chuckled and turned to look at [Jingzhou] and [Xiaoai] on the platform, then he spoke.
1:34:32|1:34:39|[Pei Liang]'s pent-up frustration found its release on this treacherous minister, as he repeatedly wielded his sword to extinguish the last glimmer of hope for Lu Yan.
1:36:59|1:37:7|While Pei Liang was teasing the two, a ghost-faced soldier carried a black box and walked behind the screen in the hall.
1:37:18|1:37:36|Seeing the object in the soldier's hand, the three individuals had different thoughts. [Pei Liang] was obviously excited. While [Xiaoai] did not despise what [Ziyu] had done, she found it hard to let go of the past, feeling more sorrowful. The ghost-faced soldier placed the black box on the table and then stood aside.
1:37:37|1:37:50|[Jingzhou] watched coldly, with no joy or sorrow in his eyes. [Pei Liang] walked to the edge of the black box, then turned to look at [Jingzhou] beside him, took a deep breath and slowly spoke.
1:38:1|1:38:28|After saying that, he extended his sleeve and asked to open the black box, only to find it empty. Almost at the same time, a long sword pierced through his chest and abdomen, blood gushing out, arrows shot into the black box. [Pei Liang] staggered and fell to the ground. Behind him, the ghost-faced soldier held a long sword, hunched over, looking at him helplessly gasping for breath. Watching [Pei Liang] spitting out blood, the ghost-faced soldier leaned on the sword and stood, letting out a sinister laugh.
1:38:28|1:38:41|[Xiaoai] looked at the appearance and smiled, knowing that this person must be [Ziyu]. For a moment, she was stunned and speechless. The soldier staggered and almost fell, hurriedly took off the ghost mask on his face and gasped for breath, just as [Xiaoai] had expected, it was indeed [Ziyu].
1:39:48|1:39:58|Pei Liang, who was on the verge of death, trembled all over upon hearing Ziyu's words, opening and closing his mouth as if he wanted to explain but was unable to speak.
1:40:10|1:40:19|[Jingzhou], lost in thought, was interrupted by [Ziyu].
1:40:26|1:40:42|Listening to his difficult description, watching the long sword thrown to his side, [Jingzhou] suddenly felt a hint of conspiracy permeating the hall, and couldn't help but be extra cautious. Seeing [Jingzhou] standing still, [Ziyu] calmed his breath, lowered his head without revealing his thoughts, and slowly spoke.
1:41:5|1:41:9|Xiaoai and Jingzhou exchanged a glance, both unaware of Ziyu's intentions.
1:41:12|1:41:31|With another loud shout, [Jingzhou] struggled to get up and dragged himself towards [Pei Liang]. In the astonished gaze of [Xiaoai], [Jingzhou] limped to [Pei Liang]'s side. Behind him, [Ziyu] sat on the throne, clutching his chest and gasping for breath, his face obscured from view as he looked down.
1:41:31|1:41:43|[Pei Liang] beneath him was already soaked in blood, unable to speak with blood pulsing in his throat, only staring in terror. Just as [Jingzhou] picked up the long sword at his feet, he suddenly felt a strong killing intent behind him.
1:41:43|1:42:9|Just crawled out from the sea of blood and corpses, he knew clearly that the murderous aura came from [Ziyu]. Sure enough, as he pretended to be about to strike down [Pei Liang], [Ziyu] behind him fiercely stabbed towards him with a long sword. Fortunately, he was on guard and counterattacked with a sword, piercing through [Ziyu]'s chest and abdomen. Then he turned around and stabbed 5 more times, killing [Ziyu] in a bloody mess, causing [Xiaoai] to gasp in shock. Gently pulling out the sword,
1:42:9|1:42:25|[Ziyu], who was already like rotten mud, collapsed on the ground. [Xiaoai] covered her eyes, nose, and mouth with her long sleeves, looking at the scene in disbelief. [Jingzhou] watched the two in front of him, a plan forming in his mind. He picked up the eerie mask at his feet and slowly pressed it towards [Ziyu]'s face.
1:42:25|1:42:40|[Jingzhou] ignored his hoarse and frantic growls, locking the ghost mask tightly above the hangar. Then he bent down and said, "Even without a real body, there is still a shadow."
1:42:42|1:42:58|[Ziyu], who was already weak due to a hidden illness, first fought against the soldiers sent by [Pei Liang] today, barely surviving. Then he forced himself to the main hall to ambush [Pei Liang], and finally was hit by 6 swords from [Jingzhou].
1:42:58|1:43:13|At this moment, he was already fading away, his breath was shallow under the ghostly face, [Ziyu] struggled to breathe and soon passed away. Before his death, scenes of last night with [Jingzhou] and [Xiaoai] entangled in passion flashed before his eyes, perhaps this was the main reason for his fatal shadow.
1:43:13|1:43:21|Jingzhou then staggered to Pei Liang's side and crouched down on the ground, whispering softly.
1:43:24|1:43:30|After speaking, Jingzhou grabbed Pei Liang's head and dragged it towards Ziyu, without any intention of calling for a doctor.
1:43:30|1:43:45|[Pei Liang], despite his resistance, was already numb from the wound that pierced his chest and abdomen. He had no choice but to let [Jingzhou] do as he pleased, sitting on the ground with [Pei Liang] leaning against his chest. [Jingzhou], at the end of his strength, struggled to drag him to [Ziyu]'s side.
1:43:45|1:43:58|Xiaoai sat dumbfounded on the side, seemingly still unable to break free from the shadow of [Jingzhou] killing her own husband. Although she did not know what [Jingzhou] intended to do, seeing him in blood-stained clothes with a fierce look in his eyes, she knew that his intentions must be bloody.
1:43:58|1:44:10|Jingzhou crouched between Pei Liang and Ziyu, picked up the long sword, gestured a few times towards Pei Liang. Seeing Jingzhou's actions, how could Pei Liang not know what Jingzhou was thinking at the moment.
1:44:10|1:44:24|He struggled immediately, only to see [Jingzhou] grabbing his throat, stabilizing his body, and slowly thrusting the long sword into [Pei Liang]. Xiaoai on the side had never seen such a scene before. She had long crouched on the ground, avoiding the sight, not daring to look any longer.
1:44:24|1:44:31|[Jingzhou] at this moment had a clear understanding in his heart, realizing that the black-clothed assassin who tried to kill his mother and himself was likely sent by [Ziyu].
1:44:31|1:44:45|Pei Liang, upon learning of this news, made some arrangements and dispatched his soldiers to secretly spy on and protect the old mansion in Jingzhou. However, if Ziyu's mother does not die and the assassins sent by Ziyu do not appear, Pei Liang's words will lack credibility.
1:44:45|1:44:55|The poor mother died inexplicably at home, becoming a victim of the power struggle between the ruler and his officials. At this moment, [Jingzhou] sets the scene to make it appear as if ghostly soldiers are assassinating [Pei Liang].
1:44:55|1:45:13|Then he stood up, took a deep breath, and walked towards Xiaoai. Seeing Jingzhou, who was covered in blood and almost unrecognizable, limping towards him, Xiaoai was so scared that he could hardly speak. Jingzhou looked at Xiaoai avoiding him in panic, the hand that wanted to touch his cheek froze with a smile on his face.
1:45:13|1:45:28|He also knew that his body was full of blood at the moment, which scared Xiaoai. So he hurriedly searched for something from his chest. Finally, he pulled out the snow plum sachet that Xiaoai had given him from his close pocket, only to find it already soaked in horrifying blood.
1:45:28|1:45:40|[Jingzhou] quickly wiped the blood on the top with his palm and handed the sachet to [Xiaoai]. Feeling the warmth of the sachet in her hand, [Xiaoai] was speechless. Facing [Jingzhou], she felt extremely complicated inside.
1:45:40|1:45:58|Looking at the broken and blood-stained body in front of her, tears silently fell from the corner of her eyes. [Jingzhou] gave [Xiaoai] a deep look, then forced herself to stand up. He knew that things were not yet finished here, and he still needed to do something. With the King of Pei gone, there was no longer [Ziyu] in this world.
1:45:58|1:46:13|There was only one commander in the world from now on, and his life of being controlled by others finally came to an end. He picked up the seven-foot-long sword brought by [Pei Liang] and walked unsteadily towards the hall. Behind him, [Xiaoai] tightly held the embroidered pouch to her chest.
1:46:13|1:46:25|The gaze followed [Jingzhou] as he gradually moved away, with a determined and weary figure. The person in front of them killed the ruler of the Pei Kingdom, killed her own husband. Thinking of this, [Xiaoai] felt her heart in turmoil, not knowing how to face it.
1:46:26|1:46:45|[Jingzhou] pushed open the palace door and walked out, attracting the attention of both the officials and courtiers. When they saw the blood-stained long sword in [Jingzhou]'s hand, which belonged to [Pei Liang], discussions broke out. [Jingzhou] stared at [Tian Zhan] in front of him, took a deep breath, and loudly declared.
