0:3:51|0:4:13|The voice gradually lowered, [Li Zhongzhi] arrived at a gift shop, approached a display case, then picked up a silver bracelet on the glass counter, wrapped it in a paper bag, and then went to a restaurant where his daughter was sitting across from him.
0:4:14|0:4:23|After Li Yongzhi finished speaking, she continued to lower her head and play with her phone, looking very unnatural. Just as Li Yongzhi was about to speak, a boy walked in from the restaurant aisle.
0:4:27|0:4:38|Henry sat next to [Li Yongzhi], with [Li Zhongzhi] staring at Henry. Seeing the interaction between the two, [Li Zhongzhi] sighed and asked Henry,
0:5:16|0:5:30|[Li Yongzhi] looked earnestly, seeing his daughter tearfully expressing her desire to have a child. [Li Zhongzhi] clenched his teeth and stared at her intently, not speaking for a long time. The scene then shifted to an ultrasound image showing a baby.
0:5:37|0:5:46|The couple smiled happily, and the scene shifted to a very romantic restaurant. At this moment, the husband and wife heard the middle-aged man across from them asking if they had chosen a name for the child.
0:6:43|0:7:2|The scene shifts, [Li Yongzhi] arrives in Pattaya, Thailand. She is walking slowly along a seawall in Pattaya, the weather is gloomy, and her expression is very dark. Suddenly, a man with his face covered approaches [Li Yongzhi] from behind and covers her mouth and nose with a towel.
0:7:3|0:7:10|And dragged her into the vehicle parked by the riverbank. The car, with [Li Yongzhi] abducted, drove along an uninhabited path.
0:7:11|0:7:24|The latter slowly opened her eyes as the car shook, reaching into her bag for her phone while lying in the back seat. Before she could press any keys, the car stopped in front of a secluded bamboo house, the door.
0:7:24|0:7:49|The scene opens with [Li Yongzhi] hurriedly stuffing his phone under the carpet and closing his eyes. The scene shifts to a dark room where [Li Yongzhi] is shackled with handcuffs and leg irons, crying and sweating as he screams towards the end, mouthing the word "dad." Fortunately, this is just a nightmare of [Li Zhongzhi]. Startled, he gets up from bed and walks into the kitchen to make juice with a blender.
0:7:50|0:8:2|The phone placed on the dining table kept vibrating at this moment. He picked up the freshly made juice, took a sip, made a face, and then answered the phone.
0:8:6|0:8:33|Upon hearing this, [Li Zhongzhi] stopped chewing on his fruit bits, immediately hung up the phone, and then arrived in Thailand. The weather on that day was as gloomy as when [Li Yongzhi] was abducted. In the bustling streets of Thailand, a taxi slowly pulled up in front of a hotel. After the car came to a stop, [Li Zhongzhi] got out of the back seat carrying a bag. A girl who was originally waiting at the hotel entrance walked up to him.
0:8:35|0:8:41|He turned out to be a friend of [Li Yongzhi], Jenny. [Li Zhongzhi] put his arm around her shoulder and they walked into the hotel together.
0:8:41|0:8:55|The waiter opened a door, and [Li Zhongzhi] and Jenny rushed in. After throwing down the bag, [Li Zhongzhi] glanced at the door and windows, shook them hard, found them locked, took two steps back, and then walked towards the small desk by the window.
0:8:55|0:9:14|Li Zhongzhi first picked up a book on the desk and flipped through it, finding nothing. Then he noticed a piece of paper with a butterfly print on the side, followed by a photo that seemed to be taken casually. Finally, he picked up a small booklet with only promotional graphics on it, containing no useful information.
0:9:14|0:9:25|After leaving the desk, he came to the dressing table, pulled out a suitcase from below, couldn't unlock it, so he forced it open, pulled the latch, flipped out a camera from inside, and then there was nothing left.
0:9:26|0:9:48|Li Zhongzhi, who had found nothing, dropped the box and sat down on a chair with his sleeves rolled up, observing the room intently. Meanwhile, a car drove up the small road and stopped at the hotel entrance. The people next to the police car immediately tried to be friendly towards the man who got out of the car wearing sunglasses, the husband of the pregnant woman from before, as he walked into the hotel.
0:10:15|0:10:28|[Cui Jie] looked into the room, where [Li Zhongzhi] was sitting by the window lost in thought. She then walked slowly into the room, glanced at the hotel bed, picked up the broken lock from the suitcase, looked around, and then heard...
0:10:34|0:10:41|[Li Zhongzhi] stood up from the window, [Cui Jie] walked to his side. After listening, [Cui Jie] reached out his right hand.
0:10:54|0:11:2|[Cui Jie] walked out the door, nodded to [Li Zhongzhi], and followed him. Jenny was waiting at the door, and [Li Zhongzhi] and Jenny arrived at the police station.
0:11:54|0:12:10|The scene shifts to the restaurant where [Li Zhongzhi] had previously given his daughter a birthday gift. He pulls back the curtain, exits the restroom, and returns to his seat. Sitting down, he stares at Henry intently and swallows hard. At this moment, a man and a woman approach their table.
0:12:46|0:13:1|[Li Zhongzhi] shook his head helplessly and replied, while [Cui Jie] glanced at the other party and then handed over the transcript. [Li Zhongzhi] didn't take it, but instead asked,
0:13:12|0:13:31|[Li Zhongzhi] sat up straight after listening, signed his name with his right hand three times, then walked out of the room. As he passed the gate, the police officer Ade was escorting a male prisoner in. [Li Zhongzhi] sat on a chair by the door, waiting for [Cui Jie]'s response. Suddenly, the prisoner turned around and knocked Ade's sunglasses off, landing at [Li Zhongzhi]'s feet.
0:13:31|0:13:35|Ade lifted his knee and pressed towards the male prisoner's legs.
0:13:41|0:13:55|Seeing the sunglasses drop at his feet, [Li Zhongzhi] picked them up and handed them back to Ade, who touched his shoulder in gratitude. Suddenly, images of [Cui Jie] with a bleeding head flashed in his mind. Ade then walked into the room and saw [Cui Jie] making a copy of [Li Zhongzhi]'s passport, and asked him about it.
0:14:22|0:14:39|After patting Ade's shoulder, he walked towards the waiting area outside the door, and then returned the original passports to Jenny and [Li Zhongzhi] who were there to record statements. After being given permission to leave, [Li Zhongzhi] followed Jenny to the tattoo shop where her boyfriend worked.
0:14:40|0:14:46|Jenny handed a piece of paper to [Li Zhongzhi] sitting on the stool.
0:15:10|0:15:25|Seeing Li Yongzhi's determination, Jenny turned on the machine and started working on the design. Feeling a little pain, Li Yongzhi shifted her gaze from the tattoo to the window. As the memory faded, Li Zhongzhi sat on the stool and spoke to Jenny.
0:15:26|0:15:31|Then he returned the tattoo paper to her and turned back to look at the chair where [Li Yongzhi] had been lying when she got the tattoo.
0:15:42|0:15:56|The scene shifts to the lounge, where [Aziz] is still adjusting the pronunciation of the script. At this moment, his aide [Zheng Hanshou] corrects him, saying that everyone should believe that the emphasis should be on themselves, not on everyone. So [Aziz] straightens up and reads it again.
0:16:10|0:16:22|When [Aziz] was about to run for re-election as the next mayor, [Zheng Hanshou] arrived at the press conference venue to adjust the lighting positions. Suddenly, he heard from the walkie-talkie that his subordinate said,
0:16:25|0:16:49|[Zheng Hanshou] hurriedly came down from the stage, making a phone call to inform the doctor that [Aziz] would arrive soon and they needed to be prepared for treatment. After hanging up the phone, he saw a stack of chairs in the corner and came up with a plan. Opening the door, he quickly walked past the reporters and arrived at the room where [Aziz] had fainted. He first asked if the latter had taken any medication, then reached past the mayor's wife to hold [Aziz]'s hand.
0:16:49|0:16:54|He then unbuttoned his shirt and instructed his henchman [Arnold] to block the staff passage.
0:17:1|0:17:26|The chairs that were stacked in the press conference hall were now pushed out from the room, with the inner side of the chairs facing away from the reporters. [Aziz] was conveniently blocked by the backrest of a chair. Upon reaching the artificial passage, a wheelchair was brought over by [Arnold]. After [Zheng Hanshou] helped [Aziz] onto the wheelchair and pressed the emergency button, he instructed [Arnold] to inform the reporters to cancel today's press conference. Then, he pushed [Aziz] towards the depths of the staff passage.
0:17:36|0:17:41|Under the command of [Zheng Hanshou], [Aziz] was smoothly taken to a private hospital on the other side.
0:18:2|0:18:9|He said that [Aziz] needs to undergo a heart transplant surgery, but there is no need to worry, as the latter will definitely be re-elected as mayor smoothly. After gaining the approval of General Long, [Zheng Hanshou] thanked him.
0:18:12|0:18:18|After hanging up the phone and putting it into the pocket of his suit, [Li Zhongzhi] looked out of the window of the ward and started to make a plan.
0:18:20|0:18:33|At this moment on the streets of Thailand, [Cui Jie] and [Li Zhongzhi] arrived at the last known location of [Li Yongzhi]'s phone based on the clues.
0:18:45|0:19:4|[Li Zhongzhi] looked hopefully at the camera, with [Cui Jie] standing on his left and right, they fast-forwarded through the video on the computer at a store and then moved on to the next one. They turned into a coffee shop, where [Cui Jie] once again showed his police badge and requested to view the surveillance footage. However, this time, they still found nothing in the fast-forwarded footage.
0:19:4|0:19:8|The two of them went from one street to another, asking at each house, until it was late at night.
0:19:38|0:20:11|Then [Li Zhongzhi] asked the girl next to Xiao Man and received a negative answer, so he slowly left. In another convenience store, [Cui Jie] was on the phone comforting [Sang Er], when suddenly [Li Zhongzhi] noticed [Li Yongzhi] entering from outside on the monitor. He also spotted a suspicious man who had been following her. He leaned closer to the screen and saw that while [Li Yongzhi] was picking things from the shelf, the man in a baseball cap was pretending to shop as well.
0:20:11|0:20:21|When Li Yongzhi walked out of the convenience store after making a purchase, the suspicious man immediately followed her from behind. Li Zhongzhi moved the mouse and brought up two screens, saying,
0:20:26|0:20:44|[Cui Jie] pressed his right hand on the chair, his left hand on the table, and watched the surveillance video with [Li Zhongzhi] carefully. When they discovered something, they immediately rushed out towards the door. Following [Cui Jie], [Li Zhongzhi] also ran out. The two of them looked around on the street, then headed towards the direction where [Li Yongzhi] had left, which was to the left front of the convenience store.
0:20:45|0:21:3|Just ahead, there was a surveillance camera under the eaves of a storefront. They immediately walked inside and checked the surveillance footage. The suspicious man happened to take off his hat in front of the camera, revealing his face. With his identity confirmed, [Cui Jie] drove [Li Zhongzhi] and parked in front of the billiard hall.
0:21:5|0:21:12|After Cui Jie finished speaking, he opened the car door, got out, closed the door, looked around, and then slowly walked into the billiard hall from the main entrance.
0:21:12|0:21:37|At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] sitting in the car nodded and looked around. Suddenly, a man wearing a baseball cap walked from the sidewalk in front of the car. As he approached the vehicle and his face became clearer, [Li Zhongzhi] confirmed that he was the suspicious man. The man then walked into the side door of the billiard hall, urgently looking for [Li Yongzhi]'s whereabouts. Without waiting any longer, [Li Zhongzhi] immediately opened the door, got out of the car, and headed towards the billiard hall.
0:21:37|0:22:4|At this moment, the man came to the bar and asked the waitress for a bottle of beer. He leered at her, and then [Li Zhongzhi] walked up to him, staring at the man without moving. The man, feeling threatened, tried to grab the beer and leave, but he was stopped by a hand on his shoulder from behind. He attempted to swing the beer bottle at [Li Zhongzhi], but was punched and sent flying. Seeing this, the man's friend stepped in to stop [Li Zhongzhi], pulling the man up and using his whole body to collide with his friend.
0:22:5|0:22:28|After knocking the man down, she performed a shoulder throw and then kicked fiercely at the man's chest. The sound of the fight caught the attention of [Cui Jie], who walked over from the main entrance. Seeing the suspicious man they were looking for about to run, he immediately flipped over the bar and chased after him. The two of them ran out of the billiard room, weaving through the narrow path, and then one after the other flipped over the roadside railing.
0:22:28|0:22:41|In the billiard hall, after knocking down the last two people, [Li Zhongzhi] also followed them out immediately. At this time, [Cui Jie] and the suspicious man arrived on the street, then ran a distance, crossed the street, and entered a motorcycle parking lot.
0:22:41|0:23:10|The two of them jumped off the motorcycle seats like playing whack-a-mole. After flipping over about 10 motorcycles, they reached the main road filled with cars and ran forward one after the other. On the other side, [Li Zhongzhi] ran out from an alley, looked around and spotted the two figures, then quickly chased after them. The three of them ran in a straight line, with the man in front suddenly turning and darting through the traffic. [Li Zhongzhi] also immediately ran towards the traffic and jumped in.
0:23:10|0:23:14|After flying over the body of a car, crashing through the front windshield of another car, he got up and continued running.
0:23:15|0:23:31|At this moment, the man turned into a game hall, bumped into a delivery worker, slipped and fell out. [Cui Jie] used his foot brake to grab the man's collar, who shook it off and ran forward again. The camera then shifted to the tourist area, watching as the man was about to jump into the sea to escape.
0:23:33|0:23:51|[Cui Jie] climbed over the railing, grabbed the man around the waist, and they both fell into the sea. By the railing, [Li Zhongzhi] and a group of people looked down. The man was taken to the police station, where [A Bin] was questioning him about why he was following [Li Yongzhi]. He claimed he was innocent.
0:24:2|0:24:26|After listening to [Cui Jie] unlock the phone and show some photos from the album, [Li Zhongzhi] took it and immediately froze. The phone displayed images of [Li Yongzhi]'s legs and skirt from obvious voyeuristic angles. [Li Zhongzhi] quickly stood up, scrolled through the phone, then handed it back to [Cui Jie]. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath.
0:24:27|0:24:46|[Cui Jie] wanted to comfort him behind him, but couldn't find the right words. Then [Li Zhongzhi] suddenly opened his eyes, turned around, pushed open the door of the police station, picked up the ceramic cup on the table and hit the man on the head. Seeing him losing control, [Cui Jie] and Ade pulled him out of the door from both sides.
0:24:46|0:25:14|Yes, after waiting for a while, [Li Zhongzhi] slowly calmed down and caught his breath. The two people holding him gradually let go of his shoulders. On the other side, the man who was beaten was restrained by A Bin, ordered not to move. Seeing this, [Li Zhongzhi] gritted his teeth, breathed heavily, ran his hand through his hair, and walked out of the police station with empty eyes. Behind him, [Cui Jie] stood with hands on hips, looking worriedly at [Li Zhongzhi]'s figure.
0:25:15|0:25:19|And Adi suddenly touched the talisman on his body, only to find that it had fallen off.
0:25:21|0:25:27|The scene cuts to [Cui Jie] entering Ad's office and taking a seat.
0:25:44|0:25:51|As they walked, [Cui Jie] took off the handcuff from his own wrist and put it on the other person's wrist after extending his hand.
0:25:59|0:26:6|After Adi gave away the bracelet on his hand and walked out of the office, [Cui Jie] lowered his head to look at the bracelet on his right hand.
0:26:24|0:26:30|Later, the car drove into the control room, while on the other side of the factory workers were orderly disassembling, packaging, and transporting the pigs.
0:26:32|0:26:43|At this moment, the two entered the control room. [Zheng Hanshou], upon hearing the mention of the price, immediately handed over a thick paper bag and instructed the other party to meet his demands.
0:27:17|0:27:37|The bearded foreigner quickly drank two servings of alcohol, then took the sign from [Zheng Hanshou] in the control room and walked out. Passing by the operating meat grinder, he threw the sign on top of the grinder, then walked through the rows of pigs hanging upside down. The scene went black, and in the darkness, a person was seen drawing blood with a syringe from the skin.
0:27:37|0:27:50|After being selected, this person fell down. The sunlight shone on her face through the cracks. It turned out to be [Li Yongzhi]. As the camera pulled back, it revealed [Li Yongzhi] with her hands tied on the ground and feet shackled to the door and window. There were many others around her.
0:27:51|0:27:59|After the phlebotomist finished his work, he walked up the stairs and closed the door. On the other side, on the streets of Thailand at night, the prostitute [Xiao Man] was drinking with her companions in front of a bar.
0:28:0|0:28:20|A car pulled up next to her, and then [Xiao Man] walked around the front of the car towards the driver's seat. The driver gestured towards [Xiao Man], and upon hearing this, she awkwardly grinned, then walked around to the passenger seat. At this moment, she saw the driver's face, who turned out to be the police officer [A Bin] from the police station.
0:28:20|0:28:26|On the hot and humid morning of the next day, [Cui Jie] brought [Li Zhongzhi] to the temple to inquire if they had seen [Li Yongzhi].
0:28:32|0:28:38|Then he slowly walked forward, staring at the Buddha statue lost in memories,
0:28:51|0:29:16|Outside the operating room, [Li Zhongzhi] sat on a chair with his elbows on his knees, looking towards the door with a serious expression. As he finished reminiscing, he now had his hands clasped together, eyes closed, furrowing his brows, praying towards a Buddha statue. Suddenly, he heard the phone ringing next to him. He answered the call with his right hand wearing a bracelet, listening attentively. Then, he looked towards where [Li Zhongzhi] was praying, and spoke into the phone, saying they would hurry over.
0:29:21|0:29:26|Cui Jie squinted at Li Zhongzhi and the latter's upturned mouth, which had been praying, immediately drooped.
0:29:28|0:29:48|At this moment, [Cui Jie] was driving with [Li Zhongzhi] towards their destination. After passing through an intersection, they could see the sea in the distance. As they approached, they saw a large crowd of people and TV reporters conducting interviews. Seeing the flashing police cars, [Cui Jie] gradually pulled the car over to the side of the road and came to a stop.
0:29:48|0:29:54|Li Zhongzhi got out of the car before it had even come to a complete stop, slammed the door shut, and headed towards the police cordon.
0:29:56|0:30:19|Behind, [Cui Jie] hurriedly put on the police uniform and caught up with him. After showing the police badge, he led [Li Zhongzhi] into the cordon. With wide eyes, [Li Zhongzhi] looked around like a headless fly. After [Cui Jie] asked about the direction of the body, he quickly led him towards the bottom of the embankment. Seeing [Li Zhongzhi] breaking through the cordon, a police officer stopped him, but he was signaled by [Cui Jie] to let him pass. Then the two hurried to the stairs next to the body.
0:30:21|0:30:37|A Bin stood under the stairs and pointed to the body for [Cui Jie], who slowly walked to the side of the body. [Li Zhongzhi] stood on the stairs, staring blankly and panting heavily, then shifted his gaze to the side. Suddenly, he noticed something? He looked at the body again and found that the feet of the body were very thick.
0:30:37|0:30:57|Standing next to the body, [Cui Jie] turned back with a look of reluctance towards [Li Zhongzhi]. The latter finally made up his mind at this moment, gritted his teeth, glanced upwards to the side, then pursed his lips and rushed down the stairs. Squatting beside the body immersed in water, he directly lifted the white cloth covering her head for a glance, then instantly restored the cloth to its original state.
0:30:58|0:31:20|Then his whole body gradually calmed down, gritted his teeth, tears streamed down the left cheek of [Li Zhongzhi], he first wiped the tears on the left shoulder of his shirt, then turned his eyes quickly, swiftly walked to the stairs, took out his phone from his pants pocket while walking, showed the photo of [Li Yongzhi] to the reporters who were taking pictures, indicating that his daughter had been missing for 6 days, if
0:31:31|0:31:37|Cui Jie, who was behind him, saw Li Yongzhi and felt a little relieved that nothing had happened yet. The two of them got back into the car.
0:31:53|0:31:59|The latter took the medicine bottle and finally showed a slight smile on his face. At this moment, [Cui Jie]'s phone rang, and he answered it with a smile.
0:32:46|0:32:52|Crying, [Sang Er] slowly placed the phone receiver next to her belly.
0:33:59|0:34:7|In the corridor outside the emergency room, [Li Zhongzhi], with his face cut by glass, sat on a bench holding his daughter, quietly sobbing as he wiped his mouth.
0:34:7|0:34:23|At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] arrived outside the ward, his mouth turned down as he stared straight at the hospital bed. On the bed, [Sang Er] tightly held [Cui Jie]'s hand, the latter sitting beside her, occasionally touching her belly. Seeing this, [Li Zhongzhi] slowly stepped back, eventually turned around and walked out of the hospital.
0:34:34|0:34:44|[Cui Jie] stood up, clasped his hands together in gratitude towards the doctor, then kissed [Sang Er]'s forehead.
0:34:47|0:34:50|Upon learning that her baby is safe and sound, [Sang Er] holds [Cui Jie]'s hand and cries, expressing relief.
0:34:50|0:35:9|On the other side, [Zheng Hanshou] brought [Sang Er]'s father to the door of the mayor's mansion-like house. The two saw the mayor's wife walking by the fountain and quickly bowed with their hands together. Then [Zheng Hanshou] led [Sang Er]'s father into the hall, where there were staff preparing for the mayor's re-election everywhere. Passing by these people, [Zheng Hanshou] told [Sang Er]'s father that the mayor often mentioned him.
0:35:11|0:35:28|The latter indicated that there were some aggressive reports attacking the mayor's health outside, but in his opinion, it shouldn't be a big problem. Then the two walked through the lounge to a closed door. Before opening the door, [Zheng Hanshou] turned back and smiled at [Sang Er]'s father, then he grasped the handle and slowly pushed the door open to walk in.
0:35:28|0:35:38|[Sang Er]'s father closely followed [Zheng Hanshou], then saw [Aziz] lying on the bed to the left of the door, wearing an oxygen mask and in a deep sleep, realizing that his health issues were indeed as reported by the media.
0:36:10|0:36:12|Hope that his son-in-law [Cui Jie] doesn't take things too seriously.
0:36:12|0:36:28|After saying that, [Zheng Hanshou] paused, turned his head to look at [Sang Er]'s father behind him, indicating that she was about to become a grandfather, surely not wanting any harm to come to his loved ones. Then he completely turned around, winked at [Sang Er]'s father, patted his shoulder, and walked back into the house.
0:36:28|0:36:32|[Sang Er]'s father turned to look at [Zheng Hanshou] as he slowly walked away, then turned back to look at the document in his hand, lost in thought.
0:36:51|0:37:1|At this moment, a taxi driver, Li Zhongzhi, who was eating in his car, also saw the news on his phone, then checked his dashcam footage. The camera then switched to the entrance of the bar.
0:37:1|0:37:14|The prostitute [Xiao Man], with a swollen face, staggered over carrying a bag, recalling what happened after [A Bin] left. Can I have the money first? As soon as [Xiao Man] entered the room, she was pulled over by [A Bin], who then punched her in the left eye.
0:37:14|0:37:35|Pushed her onto the bed, she struggled to get up but was pressed down by [A Bin], her hands were handcuffed behind her back, then [A Bin] used a belt to gag her mouth, fastening the belt securely behind her head, and occasionally slapped her buttocks with his hand. When everything was over, [A Bin] even stood with his legs apart next to her head and urinated on her face.
0:37:35|0:37:55|Saddened [Xiao Man] suddenly saw [Li Zhongzhi] still searching for [Yongzhi] on the street. After hearing from a passerby that they hadn't seen her, [Li Zhongzhi] thanked them and then asked a snack vendor nearby. The vendor also said they hadn't seen her after looking at the photo. Seeing [Li Zhongzhi] persisting like this, [Xiao Man] pursed her lips in grievance and then caught up with him, saying,
0:37:57|0:38:20|[Li Zhongzhi] immediately turned around and saw the anxious [Xiao Man]. Upon hearing about money, [Li Zhongzhi] glanced at her sideways, then turned back and continued walking forward. [Xiao Man] caught up with him, but [Li Zhongzhi] still didn't look back. She followed him all the way to the utility pole, where a startled [Xiao Man] leaned against it, gasping for breath. [Li Zhongzhi] left with a look of anger on his face.
0:38:20|0:38:43|Watching the figure leaving in front of her, [Xiao Man] slowly lowered her head, then suddenly covered her chest and bent over because her body had not fully recovered from the torment by [A Bin] earlier. Leaning against the utility pole for a while, [Xiao Man] straightened up again, furrowed her brows, gasped for breath, and started crying softly. At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] turned back and slowly walked towards [Xiao Man], who gasped again upon seeing him.
0:38:43|0:38:51|Then [Li Zhongzhi] walked up to her and said, staring intently at [Xiao Man] leaning against the utility pole.
0:38:59|0:39:7|Xiao Man was sitting in the back of the truck hugging a customer, and happened to be facing A Bin, who was dragging Yongzhi away, so she saw the whole kidnapping process clearly.
0:39:9|0:39:13|Upon hearing this, [Li Zhongzhi] quickly stepped forward and asked [Xiao Man] seriously, who just choked back a sob and smiled at him.
0:39:15|0:39:30|The next morning, [Li Zhongzhi] arrived at an intersection. Standing at the intersection, he had his hands in his pockets, furrowing his brow. Then, after seeing something, he took a step forward and walked up. At this moment, a car turned out from the police station. [Li Zhongzhi] raised his hand to stop the car and approached to inquire.
0:39:32|0:39:46|The person driving the car is [A Bin], he smiled at the front passenger and gestured for him to sit in the front seat. [Li Zhongzhi] handed his phone to [A Bin], which had a map on it. A Bin looked at it, then turned to [Li Zhongzhi] and asked,
0:39:49|0:40:10|On the other side, [Cui Jie], who was still in the hospital, took out his laptop and browsed the internal network of the police station. Inside were dashcam videos uploaded by citizens after hearing the missing person notices. He opened one of them and found a scene where one person was dragging another person to the trunk by the seaside. As the faces became clearer in the footage, the computer suddenly prompted that the video no longer existed.
0:40:10|0:40:20|After pressing twice and getting no response, [Cui Jie] picked up the computer and left the hospital. The camera then switched to [A Bin]'s car arriving at the location on the map. After pulling the handbrake, he said:
0:40:20|0:40:27|Then he glanced at [Li Zhongzhi], quickly turned back to look at the steering wheel in his hand, which ignored him and turned to look at the sea on the other side.
0:40:32|0:40:53|Someone told me that my daughter was taken away here. After hearing this, [Li Zhongzhi] slowly turned his head and stared motionlessly at [A Bin]. The latter suggested to him, with a very gentle expression on his face, appearing just like a normal police officer. However, the intense gaze from [Li Zhongzhi] made people feel uneasy. Unable to bear this kind of scrutiny, [A Bin] turned his head, but after a while, he found that [Li Zhongzhi] was still looking at him.
0:40:54|0:41:8|[A Bin] once again asked with concern, [Li Zhongzhi] still staring at him intently. He then exhaled deeply. At this moment, [A Bin]'s eyes flickered, seeing that [Li Zhongzhi] still didn't get out of the car or speak. After rubbing the steering wheel a few times and avoiding the latter's direct gaze, he drove away.
0:41:9|0:41:33|After waiting for a while and realizing that the other party was still staring at him intently, [A Bin] stood up straight and couldn't help but ask. Even so, [Li Zhongzhi] still didn't answer, continuing to stare at him with his eyes fixed. Finally, under [Li Zhongzhi]'s prolonged silence, [A Bin] couldn't help but remain silent, realizing something was wrong after speaking. He quickly turned his head to look ahead, at which point [Xiao Man] limped over from the roadside to the front of the car. Immediately, [A Bin] turned back and shouted, reaching for the buckle of [Li Zhongzhi]'s seatbelt.
0:41:35|0:41:45|Before they even made contact, the latter was pushed towards the car window by [Li Zhongzhi], who then wrapped the seatbelt around [A Bin]'s neck, making him lean against his own legs, and then fiercely struck his temple with his elbow.
0:41:46|0:41:57|On the other side, [Cui Jie] hurriedly walked into the technical room of the police station with a computer in hand, pulled up a chair next to the technician, and asked why the video she had just watched was showing as non-existent after opening the computer.
0:42:10|0:42:27|The technicians quickly found the information as promised. So [Cui Jie] rushed out with the address, arrived at his car, opened the door and was about to leave with the computer. However, the car suddenly wouldn't start. In a panic, he pounded the steering wheel. At that moment, [Aziz] drove in from outside. [Cui Jie] quickly got out of the car and stood in front of it, clasping his hands together, hoping that the other person could help him.
0:42:27|0:42:40|Driving with [Cui Jie], [Adel] turned the car onto a narrow alley after hearing the former say to turn left at the intersection. The car slowly came to a stop, and [Cui Jie] got out of the car, apologized to [Adel], and then walked deep into the alley.
0:42:42|0:43:6|Looking around at the tall residential buildings according to the address provided by the technicians, at this moment, three men came up from the corridor of the building. After stopping in front of door 57, the bearded foreign man who had already traded with [Zheng Hanshou] at the pork processing plant knocked on the door. Outside the box, [Ad] helped [Cui Jie] out of the car and started to reverse. Suddenly, the car stalled, so he had to stop, get out of the car, and open the hood to fix it.
0:43:7|0:43:26|On the other side, [Cui Jie] continued walking towards the depths of the alley. After passing by a fruit stall and a laundry shop, he arrived at the entrance of a 7-story residential building, Building 2. The door of Unit 57 was open. The taxi driver from earlier asked the bearded foreign man if he needed anything. The foreign man kicked him into the house, knocked over the computer, and demanded that he find the video he had previously uploaded to the police.
0:43:27|0:43:31|The driver, Li Zhongzhi, with blood coming out of his mouth, frantically searched through the boxes, whimpering in fear.
0:43:31|0:43:52|At this moment, [Cui Jie] walked up the stairs and turned into the hallway on this floor. He looked up at the door plates of each door, continuing forward if he didn't find the one he was looking for. After checking each one, he suddenly saw a small bearded man behind a cabinet ahead, chewing on corn. After a glance, [Cui Jie] looked up and realized that the door plate on the left of the cabinet was the address he was looking for.
0:43:52|0:44:10|He ignored the man with a small beard, turned around and walked to the door, knocked on it and asked if anyone was inside. The driver was copying the video and shouting for help. Then, [Cui Jie] immediately pulled out a gun from his waist, but the man with a small beard suddenly pushed a cabinet against his back. The door opened, and the man with long hair tightly hugged his neck and dragged him towards the window.
0:44:10|0:44:14|The bearded foreign man saw the video duplication completed, picked up a bottle of mineral water, and poured it on the power source.
0:44:43|0:45:7|Then he fiercely smashed towards the right arm of the man holding the gun, and then forcefully knocked the gun-holding hand against the glass. Seeing that the gun hadn't fallen, the bearded foreign man grabbed [Cui Jie]'s right hand and fiercely threw it out. The gun happened to fall in front of [Ad], who picked it up and looked up. At this moment, [Cui Jie] pushed away from the window, pressing down on the bearded man. The foreign man was heavily slammed on the table by an elbow strike to the waist, then got up and fiercely smashed his fist under the armpit of the small bearded man.
0:45:7|0:45:27|Then he jumped up and used his knee to hit the opponent's throat, turned his head and hugged the man with long hair's neck and pressed down, lifted his knee heavily to hit his face, pulled him up and threw him towards the bearded foreign man. Subsequently, [Cui Jie] once again fought with the bearded man, the two were evenly matched, exchanging punches and kicks. Outside the door, [Aziz] ran into the corridor holding a gun.
0:45:28|0:45:49|The bearded foreign man was punched to the door by [Cui Jie], and as he hurriedly ran out, he ran into [Aziz] holding a gun at the door. The latter was about to shoot but had his magazine removed by him. Seeing this, [Li Zhongzhi] immediately kicked the bearded man away. Just as the foreign man was about to enter the door to help [Cui Jie] fight two other men, he heard [Cui Jie] say "catch him", and then [Li Zhongzhi] immediately ran towards the direction he was escaping and fired a shot.
0:45:49|0:46:5|Due to the clutter in the aisle, after [Ad] finished shooting without hitting him, the bearded foreign man hurriedly ran towards the stairs. Just as he was about to go down the stairs, he found that the gate of the railing was locked. After shaking it a few times without opening it, he was immediately caught up by [Ad].
0:46:5|0:46:18|In the chaos, the bearded foreign man stepped on the armrest and flipped into the aisle, trying to go to the rooftop from the outside stairs. Just as he stepped on the stairs, he was grabbed by the ankle from behind by [Adi], and then [Adi] kicked him in the chest with one hand on the ground.
0:46:18|0:46:24|[Cui Jie] lifted the legs of the man with a small beard, and then threw him fiercely onto the man with long hair.
0:46:24|0:46:50|The two saw the boss running away, quickly got up and ran towards the door. Outside the door, three people were fighting, then they ran down the aisle together. On the other side, the bearded foreign man who was kicked ran to the flower bed on the rooftop, [Ade] picked up a flower pot and kicked it towards the former. After being kicked down, the former got up again and started fighting with [Ade]. By this time, the two men had already run down from upstairs, and then they entered the vegetable market in the alley in a zigzag manner.
0:46:50|0:47:14|Two people entered the market and randomly scattered items on both sides to stop the man following closely behind, [Cui Jie]. He couldn't shake him off. The man with a little monkey on his back pushed a cart and bumped into him, then turned and ran. However, [Cui Jie] directly crossed over the cart and kicked him to the ground with one foot. He then handcuffed his right hand and pushed the man with long hair down, handcuffing his left hand with the other hand. Inside the building, [Aziz] kept hitting the bearded foreign man's shoulders and waist with his elbows and wrists.
0:47:15|0:47:38|A crowd of curious boys gathered around. One of them jumped in place, [Adi] clamped the neck of the bearded foreign man with his legs, then exerted force from his waist to throw him heavily to the ground. The man got up, grabbed a large parasol nearby, and used the sharp ribs of the umbrella to attack [Adi]. The latter quickly retreated, then supported the ground with his left hand, performed a 360-degree flip, and fiercely kicked the opponent's neck with his left leg.
0:47:38|0:48:1|Seeing the bearded foreign man still able to get up, [Adel] extended his right leg this time, kicking him directly into the resident's house behind him. The latter stood up dizzily, found [Adel], and threw a punch at him again, only to be kicked by [Adel] towards another resident's house. Seeing the bearded foreign man still struggling, [Adel] kicked him in the air twice in a row, finally kicking him out of the residential building onto the terrace.
0:48:1|0:48:20|The bearded foreign man unwillingly clutched his chest and got up, throwing punches at [Ade] again. He was then kicked towards the right side of his neck, flying towards the railing on the left. Just as he was about to fall headfirst from the rooftop, [Ade] hurriedly reached out and grabbed his waist, then grabbed his leg with one hand and his pants with the other, pulling him up with all his strength.
0:48:20|0:48:37|The bearded foreign man hanging outside the building looked down at the scene below and urgently called for help from [Ad], who then reached out his right hand to him. The bearded foreign man quickly grabbed onto it, and the boys watching on the side cheered happily as they saw both of them on the balcony.
0:48:37|0:48:55|After the bearded foreign man was rescued, he signaled to [Adi] to handcuff him or loosen his collar. Suddenly, an accident occurred, and the bearded foreign man lifted a little boy behind him and threw him towards [Adi]. Seeing [Adi] catch the boy, the bearded foreign man then lifted another boy and, despite [Adi] trying to stop him, he directly threw the boy he was holding out of the building.
0:48:57|0:49:20|[Li Zhongzhi] hurried over, leaped over the railing, grabbed the little boy and threw him back onto the rooftop. Then, gripping the edge of the rooftop with both hands, he managed to pull himself up after his right hand slipped. Just as he was about to jump over the railing onto the rooftop, he heard the bearded foreign man shouting "Go to hell!" and was then kicked in the chest, falling backwards.
0:49:20|0:49:32|During the fall, after hitting the elastic cable, he adjusted his direction and grabbed the TV antenna dish outside the building with both hands. However, the screws on the dish suddenly loosened, so Li Zhongzhi, who was holding him, accelerated and flipped towards the ground, falling down.
0:49:38|0:49:47|Then he remembered how [Adel] had given him the bracelet for safety in the office before, but now the person who gave him the bracelet was lying on the cement floor with blood flowing from his head, unable to move for a long time.
0:50:1|0:50:22|Madam thanked [Zheng Hanshou] and then looked worriedly at [Aziz] again. In the hospital corridor, [Arno] reported to [Zheng Hanshou] that he had found the information they were looking for. Upon hearing this, the former said they would proceed with the surgery tonight. Meanwhile, in a run-down old building, [Li Zhongzhi] was on his knees, pushing against someone. The camera zoomed in as [Li Zhongzhi] was sweating profusely, panting heavily, with fresh blood on the back of his hand.
0:50:23|0:50:35|Exhausted, he suddenly knelt on the ground and forcefully smashed the iron wire mesh on the wall. Upon closer inspection, the person bound to the wire mesh was none other than [A Bin], his entire face already covered in blood.
0:50:35|0:50:41|His left eye couldn't even open, he could only sit on the ground gasping for air carefully. At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] approached him and asked,
0:50:43|0:50:59|The face of [A Bin], already swollen from the beating, blinked painfully. Blood trickled down his head onto his collar and chest. Then, [Li Zhongzhi] took out his phone from his pocket and held up a photo of [Li Yongzhi] in front of [A Bin] with a pained expression.
0:51:22|0:51:44|With empty eyes staring at the wire mesh, reminiscing about the childhood of [Li Yongzhi], he saw her smiling and waving at the camera. Then [Li Zhongzhi] lowered his head to look at the current photo of Yongzhi on his phone, made up his mind. Hearing a strange sound, [A Bin] widened his right eye and saw [Li Zhongzhi] dragging something over, his legs quickly kicking against the cement floor.
0:51:51|0:52:5|After tying up, Li Zhongzhi immediately picked up a large sledgehammer and swung it towards the direction where A Bin was sitting. Xiao Man was standing on the side, watching nervously on a gasoline drum. Li Zhongzhi swung the sledgehammer down one by one, hitting A Bin's head each time, finally striking his chest this time.
0:52:12|0:52:16|He then put down the big sledgehammer and pulled his shirt down from his eyes.
0:52:21|0:52:44|After dispersing the crowd, they drove towards the hospital. At this moment, a car sped past on the road. Bound to the passenger seat, [A Bin] said to [Li Zhongzhi], while on the other side, [Zheng Hanshou] taped a girl's mouth and put her in the trunk. As he closed the door, his face was reflected on the transparent glass. It turned out to be Yongzhi.
0:52:44|0:53:3|Shortly after [Zheng Hanshou] took off his suit, opened the car door and sat in the driver's seat, fastened the seat belt, and started the vehicle, [Li Zhongzhi] was sweating profusely, anxiously gripping the steering wheel and asking [A Bin]. By this time, [Zheng Hanshou] had already driven the car out, then turned into a small road in a field. On the deserted street, he kept accelerating forward.
0:53:3|0:53:28|[Li Zhongzhi] urgently revved the engine towards the direction of the cabin, wiping off the sweat occasionally. Anxiously searching for Yongzhi, he ran a red light and collided directly with the vehicle driven by [Cui Jie]. The tires rubbed fiercely against the ground, spinning wildly before he stabilized the car. Yongzhi's phone, hidden in the back seat, accidentally moved out from under the carpet. At this moment, an ambulance rushed through the intersection, with [Cui Jie] closely followed by Ad's car from behind.
0:53:28|0:53:43|He observed a traffic accident at the intersection from the rearview mirror, then accelerated away. On one side, the two people whose cars collided had no intention of getting out of the car. In the trunk of Zheng Hanshou's car was the unconscious Li Yongzhi, while A Bin was tied up with a rope on Li Zhongzhi's passenger seat.
0:53:43|0:54:2|The latter was covered in blood, looking quite tragic. [Li Zhongzhi] sat in the driver's seat, staring firmly at the direction of the rear of [Zheng Hanshou]'s car, gripping the steering wheel tightly and breathing heavily. On the other side, [Zheng Hanshou] saw [Li Zhongzhi], who had crashed into his car, still not getting out, also gripping the steering wheel anxiously. He then raised his left hand and pushed his glasses up.
0:54:2|0:54:20|Glancing at the left rearview mirror and continuing to grip the steering wheel with both hands, [Li Zhongzhi] sees [A Bin] spitting out blood. Just as he is about to take action, he suddenly hears the sound of a police car coming from his right front. The police car then stops directly behind [Zheng Hanshou]'s vehicle. At this moment, the latter takes a deep breath, tightens his grip on the steering wheel, and then looks through the right rearview mirror.
0:54:20|0:54:23|Two police officers got out of the front of the police car, one on the left and one on the right.
0:54:23|0:54:40|He turned his head to look at the left rearview mirror again, [Li Zhongzhi] at this time clenched the steering wheel, his eyes red, saw two police officers about to walk past the intersection to question him, quickly reversed and turned back, the police officers found he was trying to escape, so they shouted to stop him, then quickly got back into the police car and chased after him.
0:54:40|0:54:45|On the other side, Li Zhongzhi shrugged when he saw the police leaving, then quickly started the vehicle and drove away from the intersection.
0:54:58|0:55:6|Li Zhongzhi is now hiding in the tall reeds with his car. He cautiously starts the vehicle after seeing the police car drive away on the small road, and sets off towards the destination once again.
0:55:6|0:55:15|Finally, the vehicle passed through a dense forest and turned into an open-air parking lot. [Li Zhongzhi] quickly hit the brakes, unbuckled his seatbelt, got out of the car, and walked towards [A Bin].
0:55:15|0:55:30|Seeing the latter already unconscious in the co-pilot seat, he forcefully pulled him down from the seat. And so, [A Bin] was tied up behind his back, covered in blood, lying on the cement floor. [Li Zhongzhi] kicked him in the chest, kicked him in the stomach, venting his resentment.
0:55:30|0:55:56|He then turned his head and ran towards the small house in front of him. Inside the cluttered small house, there was a door. [Li Zhongzhi] quickly approached, pulled open the door, and walked in. Inside the door were two shabby shelves and a sofa. On the floor in front of the sofa was a rope, and looking down, he saw a pull ring attached to the rope. [Li Zhongzhi] pulled the ring hard, stepped on the wooden stairs below, and quickly went down to the bottom of the stairs. After seeing the scene around him, he was stunned.
0:55:56|0:56:17|In a space of less than ten square meters, there were many obviously used blankets on the floor. Seeing that there was no one here, he turned around and walked towards the stairs. Just as he stepped on a step, he saw the situation under his feet through the sunlight. The birthday gift he had given to [Li Yongzhi], the bracelet, appeared at the bottom of the handrail. [Li Zhongzhi] held it in his palm, tears in his eyes, stared at it tightly for a while, clenched his fist, and quickly went upstairs.
0:56:18|0:56:29|At this moment, a police car parked outside the door next to [Li Zhongzhi]'s car. The two police officers who had previously been in the front seat opened the door and got out with their guns. They found [A Bin] lying face up on the ground, and they squatted down to shake his body.
0:56:34|0:56:54|Shouting loudly, [Li Zhongzhi] ordered the latter to raise his hands high. After [Li Zhongzhi] did so, one of the police officers turned his body and as he tried to handcuff the former's right hand, [Li Zhongzhi] swiftly evaded, then quickly pushed the other police officer pointing a gun at himself out, kicked the handcuff-holding police officer into the bushes, and immediately turned and ran towards the reeds behind the cabin.
0:56:54|0:57:12|Two policemen quickly got up and raised their guns towards the direction where [Li Zhongzhi] was running, chasing after him. They ran through the reeds, and [Li Zhongzhi] entered a small forest full of tree trunks. He ran around the tree trunks, with the two policemen closely following behind. At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] once again disappeared into a dense patch of reeds.
0:57:15|0:57:19|The two police officers ran while pushing aside the branches of the surrounding reeds, then shouted loudly ahead to stop immediately, or they would shoot.
0:57:19|0:57:39|Seeing [Li Zhongzhi] ignoring the warning, the two police officers kept pulling the trigger forward, but all the shots hit the tree trunk beside him. Finally, they ran out of the reeds. At this moment, a small river appeared in front of [Li Zhongzhi]. He ran across the river on a tree trunk lying on the water. The two police officers behind also arrived at the river bank and kept shooting towards the other side, but the tree trunk on the river blocked their view.
0:57:39|0:58:3|Adding to that, [Li Zhongzhi] quickly ran up the hill and flipped over to run towards the back slope. The two police officers could only watch as he ran away in the direction of the river and slowly lowered their pistols. Meanwhile, [Cui Jie] sat on a chair outside the emergency room of the hospital, weakly pulling his hair. At this moment, a man in a suit walked up to him and taught him something. [Cui Jie] quickly stood up and called the man "Director", who turned out to be [Sang Er]'s father.
0:58:3|0:58:15|He hadn't had a chance to answer the other party about Ad's current situation when he heard the doctor open the door and walk out of the emergency room, saying that he had done his best. Due to the severe bleeding in Ad's brain, he had passed away. The family could start making arrangements.
0:58:16|0:58:39|After the doctor finished speaking, he turned and opened the door to the emergency room. [Cui Jie] couldn't accept the news, blinked his eyes and looked up at the ceiling, then turned and walked to the hospital wall, hitting it hard. Tears in his eyes, his body trembling. At that moment, a police officer walked up to the director and said that colleagues had chased a hit-and-run vehicle, and found [A Bin] unconscious next to the vehicle.
0:58:39|0:58:58|After the investigation, it was determined that the suspect came from Hong Kong. [Cui Jie], who was originally leaning against the wall with his arms, heard this news and immediately turned and walked out of the hospital. He then arrived at the cabin where [Li Zhongzhi] had previously posted the video, bending down to come down the stairs. [Cui Jie] turned his head to survey the cramped space, then squatted down to pick up something from the ground.
0:58:58|0:59:4|It turned out to be a shackle tied to a pillar. He looked down at the shackle for a moment, then put down the things and walked outside.
0:59:5|0:59:26|At this moment, three police officers are taking photos of the car driven by [Li Zhongzhi]. One of the officers approaches [Cui Jie] and informs him that a cellphone was found in the car. Cui Jie takes the phone, goes back to his own car to charge it, and unlocks the screen. On the screen is a selfie of [Li Yongzhi]. Meanwhile, [Zheng Hanshou] appears on the screen with a frown, surrounded by many blood-stained plastic clothes.
0:59:26|0:59:44|After pacing back and forth, he stopped and looked ahead, his lips slightly parted. In the next scene, [Li Zhongzhi] emerged from the reeds by the small path and started running. By this time, the sun was slowly setting, the sky darkening. The path was deserted, so he quickened his pace towards the end of the path, continuing his search for [Li Yongzhi].
0:59:53|1:0:10|At the door of Aziz's ward, despite hearing from colleagues that he had not woken up yet, Li Zhongzhi still turned the handle and walked to Aziz's bedside. There, he saw Aziz, with bruises on his face, unconscious with an oxygen mask on. Cui Jie stood anxiously with hands on hips, pacing back and forth. At that moment, the TV was reporting that a police officer had been severely beaten and was lying in the hospital for treatment.
1:0:25|1:0:30|After finding no useful information, he turned to the call records. [Li Zhongzhi] asked [Xiao Man] seriously,
1:0:40|1:0:46|After the call was disconnected, [Xiao Man] held her phone and dialed again, hearing the other party say hello. [Xiao Man] repeated the same words as before.
1:0:53|1:1:0|[Li Zhongzhi] held up the phone to [Xiao Man], who then picked up the phone and pressed the keys one by one. After connecting, there was no answer from the other party, so [Xiao Man] spoke first, saying that she needed a kidney.
1:1:4|1:1:10|A foreigner speaking English asked who made the introduction. Upon hearing this, [Li Zhongzhi] widened his eyes, and [Xiao Man] looked up at him before telling the person on the phone that it was introduced by [Aziz].
1:1:11|1:1:27|The person on the phone didn't speak and hung up directly. It turned out to be the bearded foreign man, and at this moment, Xiao Man raised her phone. The screen of Xiao Man's phone showed that the name of this bearded foreign man was xx.
1:1:27|1:1:47|After listening, Li Zhongzhi quickly flipped through Aziz's phone album, and after searching for a while, he held it up to Xiao Man. The latter glanced at the phone, then nodded at Li Zhongzhi. In the photo, Aziz had a cigar in his left hand and his arm around Sha Cha's neck, their relationship looking very close. At this moment, a car with its headlights on slowly stopped downstairs at the hospital.
1:1:47|1:2:12|The back door opened and a man got out of the car, holding a briefcase in his left hand. It turned out to be the [Director]. After getting off the car, he turned to the back seat, where [Zheng Hanshou] was smiling and gesturing at him with folded hands. He returned the gesture, slowly closed the car door, then looked towards the hospital gate. After pausing for a moment, he walked slowly towards it. Turning into the corridor, the [Director] walked with the briefcase in his hands. At the end of the corridor were the guards [Aziz] and [Cui Jie].
1:2:12|1:2:27|The guard saw Director approaching and wanted to salute, but was gestured not to. Director walked lightly towards Cui Jie sitting on a chair, then sat next to him with a file bag in hand. The sound of sitting down disturbed the dozing Cui Jie, who quickly straightened up in his chair.
1:2:45|1:2:53|The latter had a date with [Sang Er] tonight. Could it be that he forgot about the appointment because he was here guarding [Aziz]? At this moment, [Cui Jie] suddenly remembered that there was indeed such a thing and was about to say something.
1:2:53|1:3:7|Seeing the gaze of [Director] towards himself, he smiled awkwardly, and the scene shifted back to the romantic restaurant. [Director] sat across from the couple, asking if they had chosen a name for their child. [Sang Er] smiled awkwardly at [Cui Jie] and replied that they hadn't decided yet.
1:3:7|1:3:19|Then the [Director] took out a piece of paper from the pocket of his suit jacket, on which were written five names. He hoped they could refer to it later, but it was fine if they didn't like it. The couple could make their own decision. Looking carefully at the paper, [Sang Er] smiled at the [Director].
1:3:36|1:3:47|Then he pulled [Cui Jie]'s arm to signal that he was going on stage to sing. She looked at him gently. At this moment, a person wearing plastic gloves inserted a syringe into another person's arm. After the injection, the person in disheveled clothes who turned and left was [A Bin].
1:4:8|1:4:18|Then Cui Jie's phone rang, he glanced at the caller ID, answered the call and put it to his ear. Across from him, the Director turned his head and squinted at Cui Jie. After hearing what was said, Cui Jie's left hand holding the phone dropped weakly.
1:5:11|1:5:30|In this country, everyone is at risk of disappearing at any time, including oneself and [Cui Jie]. Upon hearing this shocking news, the latter widened his eyes and weakly leaned back on the chair, then looked towards the direction of the [Director], who shook his head helplessly. Back at the hospital, [Zheng Hanshou] handed a file bag to the [Director] in the car. After opening it, the [Director] saw [Sha Cha]'s personal information. After carefully examining it, he heard [Zheng Hanshou] saying that he and his men were all dead.
1:6:21|1:6:37|Everyone followed his orders, [Cui Jie] snapped out of his daze only after hearing the command for everyone to obey. Then the Director recalled another order given to him by [Zheng Hanshou] in the car, to make [Li Zhongzhi] disappear once found. The Director looked at [Zheng Hanshou] smiling at him, and could only purse his lips and lower his head.
1:6:37|1:6:58|On the other side of the dark street, [Cui Jie] lit two candles and burned paper money. The camera zoomed in, revealing that this place was where [Ade] fell from. In the drizzle, [Cui Jie] prayed silently while burning the paper, holding the bracelet given to him by [Ade]. He squatted down, bowed his head, tightly squeezed the bracelet, and then left after it burned out. The scene shifted to a large car parked in the middle of the alley next to the gatehouse.
1:6:58|1:7:18|Inside the car, all are monitoring computers. [Cui Jie] is sitting next to the door, having a video call with [Director] and colleagues. Meanwhile, [Sha Cha] rides a small motorcycle and stops in front of the elevator at the pork processing plant. He then enters the plant and parks another electric bike in front of the control room. He walks into the control room while looking at his phone, muttering a lyric, "I will embrace you tonight, I will meet you tonight."
1:7:21|1:7:30|Then, on the other side, fully armed police officers with masks sat down. They reported to [Cui Jie] that they were ready, and he pressed the microphone in the car, indicating to start the operation in 30 seconds, while checking his watch.
1:7:30|1:7:53|At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] enters the frame and looks around. It turns out he has also arrived at the processing plant. [Cui Jie] sees this on the monitor and quickly calls off the operation. The Director, via video call, instructs [Cui Jie] not to interfere and tells him that [Li Zhongzhi] must die. Seeing himself being ordered to obey, [Cui Jie] angrily closes the video call with a fierce look in his eyes. He watches [Li Zhongzhi] on the monitor, feeling very confused. At that moment, [Li Zhongzhi] arrives at the gate of the pork processing plant.
1:7:53|1:8:9|Walking into the room after looking at the sign on the wall, he furrowed his brows and walked a short distance before turning into a corridor. On the right side of the corridor, there was a room. He walked slowly towards it, tried to pull the door but it didn't open. Then he tiptoed and looked inside through the glass on the door.
1:8:9|1:8:28|At this moment, someone heard a voice asking [Li Zhongzhi] what he was up to. Li replied that he was looking for the restroom but was refused. He then grabbed the other person's elbow and twisted it fiercely, pulled him towards himself and smashed his nose with a right fist. The person fell to the ground and Li kicked his face with his right foot. He then walked towards the deeper end of the corridor. Another person saw his fallen companion and wanted to come forward to teach [Li Zhongzhi] a lesson.
1:8:28|1:8:41|Li Zhongzhi was pushed against the wall by the latter, and at this moment, a door appeared in the depths of the corridor. Li Zhongzhi glanced at his fainted opponent, pulled the access card from his neck, and then walked step by step towards the direction of the door with the access card in hand.
1:8:41|1:9:1|Arriving at the door, [Li Zhongzhi] lowered his head and swiped the access card. At this moment, [Sha Cha] casually glanced at the surveillance and noticed [Li Zhongzhi] walking towards the processing plant. Passing by an intersection, a man leaning against the wall playing with his phone noticed [Li Zhongzhi] and shouted at him. [Li Zhongzhi] turned around and threw a punch at the man, then followed up with a flurry of punches to his face. The man fell to the ground, face up, after being hit repeatedly. Watching the whole process through the surveillance, [Sha Cha] exclaimed how powerful [Li Zhongzhi] was.
1:9:5|1:9:13|Hearing a voice, [Li Zhongzhi] turned around to see it coming from the walkie-talkie on the man's belt. Then [Li Zhongzhi] looked up towards the direction of the camera, walked over to the man, pulled off the walkie-talkie, pressed the button and asked [Sha Cha], where is [Li Yongzhi]? [Sha Cha] responded.
1:9:16|1:9:25|Wants to play a game with [Li Zhongzhi], if the latter can find himself, then let [Li Zhongzhi] see his daughter, then [Sha Cha] said he is on the right side, just need [Li Zhongzhi] to come over.
1:9:25|1:9:36|Putting down the walkie-talkie from his mouth, [Li Zhongzhi] passed through a glass room full of thugs. The thugs inside the room heard [Sha Cha] saying through the walkie-talkie that they must catch [Li Zhongzhi], then turned and all rushed towards [Li Zhongzhi]'s direction as he walked out.
1:9:36|1:9:48|The first one ran towards [Li Zhongzhi], who dodged the punch and smashed it towards his face. The second one kicked towards [Li Zhongzhi]'s stomach, but he grabbed the leg and pressed it to the ground, then jumped up and stomped on the opponent's legs spread apart.
1:9:48|1:10:8|At this moment, the third person approached [Li Zhongzhi], who struck him in the neck with a punch. Seeing his companion fall to the ground, the fourth person also ran over. Before he could land a punch on [Li Zhongzhi], he was hit in the temple and fell to the ground. After dealing with the people, [Li Zhongzhi] observed his surroundings and walked forward, lifting another curtain. [Li Zhongzhi] entered the freight corridor of the processing plant, where many people holding knives appeared ahead.
1:10:8|1:10:14|[Li Zhongzhi] walked towards the fifth person, who was holding a machete and swung it at him. Li Zhongzhi countered with a shoulder throw and then stabbed the knife into him.
1:10:14|1:10:33|The sixth person shouted and ran towards [Li Zhongzhi], who bent down to dodge the machete, then grabbed the person's leg and pulled him down. He then dodged the seventh person, slid on the ground to kick down the eighth person, flipped over and broke the ninth person's leg. When he saw the seventh person pouncing again, [Li Zhongzhi] smashed his temple with his elbow and kicked the eighth person's chest with his foot, sending him flying out.
1:10:33|1:10:52|Then he saw another curtain in the corridor, so he lifted it and walked in. It was the pork cold storage room, where two men with knives were waiting at the door. When the two men rushed towards him, [Li Zhongzhi] quickly hid behind a row of pork, knocked out the tenth one who came after him with two punches, then flipped him over and pinned him to the ground. He secured one hand and kicked towards his head.
1:10:52|1:11:8|Bu then grabbed the machete and slid towards the eleventh person standing on the table. After the person fell down, Bu used the knife handle to fiercely hit his temple. With that, the person was taken care of. [Li Zhongzhi] walked out of the cold storage room filled with pigs, holding the machete, and entered the assembly line workshop. Looking around, [Li Zhongzhi] picked up the walkie-talkie hanging on his waist and pressed the button to ask where [Sha Cha] was.
1:11:10|1:11:28|In the monitoring room, [Li Zhongzhi] was seen standing to his right front. [Sha Cha] walked out of the control room and shouted at [Li Zhongzhi] as if he were a wild boar. Then he stared at [Li Zhongzhi] and even imitated the sound of a wild boar. Seeing [Sha Cha] in person, [Li Zhongzhi] put down the walkie-talkie in his hand and slowly turned to face him. The latter ordered his three henchmen behind him, who were holding machetes, to cut [Li Zhongzhi] into pieces.
1:11:30|1:11:40|In two halves, [Li Yongzhi] shouted and asked where [Yongzhi] was, then smashed the walkie-talkie to the side. Three people on this side ran over with machetes, one wearing a hooded sweatshirt, one wearing a shirt, and one wearing a hat, their skills completely different from the previous ones.
1:11:40|1:11:57|They took turns swinging knives in the workshop, forcing [Li Zhongzhi] to step back. With both hands holding a machete, he blocked the man in the cap's attack. [Li Zhongzhi] quickly moved around a cement pillar, but the man in the cap blocked his way, slashing at him. Then two others joined the fight, pushing [Li Zhongzhi] to the side of the station control panel.
1:11:57|1:12:11|The man in the cap took the opportunity to raise his knife and slash at his right arm. After being cut, [Li Zhongzhi] quickly kicked off the ground and flipped over from the knife-wielding platform. The man in the cap grabbed another iron rod and chased after him. [Niu Jieshi] inserted the machete into the pillar next to [Li Zhongzhi]'s head, who immediately grabbed his right hand and threw him out with a somersault.
1:12:11|1:12:23|On the other side, a small car quickly pulled up from the dark alley. The door opened, and [Director] frowned as he got out of the car. He then yanked open the door of the command car, pointed at [Cui Jie], and asked what he was up to. Walking over to Ma Feng, he said he was Director Cai.
1:12:32|1:12:52|After receiving a positive response, [Cui Jie] punched Director Cai in the right eye, then kicked open the door of the command vehicle and ran towards the pig processing plant. Director Cai sat on a stool, sighed, and pressed his forehead. Inside the plant, Hat Man and Shirt Man stood one after the other in the direction of [Li Zhongzhi]. After catching his breath, Shirt Man once again rushed towards him with a machete. [Li Zhongzhi] quickly engaged in a struggle with him, blocking the arm wielding the knife aimed at his abdomen.
1:12:52|1:12:58|He locked the man's arms with both hands and pushed him backwards, then kicked him to the ground with force.
1:13:0|1:13:9|At this moment, the man in the hat and the man in the cap approached from the side, coordinating their attack. The latter jumped up and slashed Li Zhongzhi's left thigh. After the man in the shirt joined in, he kicked Li Zhongzhi to the ground, and when he got up, he was cut on the left chest by the man in the cap.
1:13:9|1:13:23|At this moment, [Sha Cha] was singing while driving his electric bike, passing by on the right side of [Li Zhongzhi]. Then the three people on the opposite side continued to attack [Li Zhongzhi], slashing him twice on the waist and back. He then lay on the conveyor belt, using his hands and feet to attack the three people before flipping over and standing on the ground.
1:13:23|1:13:38|The man in the hat, upon seeing this, lifted his leg high from the right and kicked Li Zhongzhi in the left face. He was directly kicked flying onto another operating table. Sha Cha, riding an electric scooter, leisurely picked up a curved hook fork and swung it towards the kneeling Li Zhongzhi on the operating table. The hook firmly pierced into the latter's calf, then Sha Cha pulled hard, causing Li Zhongzhi to lie on the ground.
1:13:41|1:13:47|At this moment, [Sha Cha] accelerated and dragged [Li Zhongzhi] through the factory, passing by a cement pillar. The latter hurriedly grabbed onto it, trying to stop.
1:13:47|1:13:58|Seeing this, [Sha Cha] accelerated fiercely, the tires rubbing against the ground at high speed, causing smoke to rise. The blood from [Li Zhongzhi]'s calf kept flowing as a result of the stalemate. After another acceleration, [Li Zhongzhi] finally let go in pain.
1:13:58|1:14:10|At this moment, [Cui Jie] burst in with a gun, only to find [Sha Cha] dragging [Li Zhongzhi]. He quickly fired a few shots towards [Sha Cha] and then swiftly flipped over the control panel to take on the other three henchmen. [Sha Cha] also hurriedly abandoned the electric bike and took cover behind a cement pillar.
1:14:10|1:14:22|At this moment, [Cui Jie] hurriedly arrived by [Li Zhongzhi]'s side, helped him sit up, and dragged him to lean against a wall. Seeing the curved hook on [Li Zhongzhi]'s leg, she wanted to remove it, but was quickly stopped by the latter.
1:14:22|1:14:43|At this moment in the command vehicle, [Director] pressed the microphone to notify the team to act immediately. Soon, many armed police officers wearing masks came running from all directions of the alley. The man with the hat in the pork processing plant was slowly approaching [Li Zhongzhi] with a machete. [Cui Jie] finally pulled out the grappling hook, and as the man with the hat heard the sound and raised his knife to strike, he quickly picked up the gun and shot him in the chest.
1:14:45|1:14:53|The man in the cap then approached [Cui Jie], who took the knife from [Li Zhongzhi] and confronted him, kicking him over with one foot. The man in the shirt then flipped over the operating table and ran over.
1:15:7|1:15:24|Then [Sha Cha] turned over the operating table, roaring as he approached [Cui Jie]. The latter picked up a machete and met him head-on, the two machetes and cleavers constantly clashing in the air. They circled each other while fighting, and when [Cui Jie] saw an opportunity, he slashed [Sha Cha]'s chest. Gritting his teeth, [Sha Cha] exerted force and when he saw [Cui Jie] turn around, he slashed his back.
1:15:24|1:15:37|The two gasping individuals stared at each other with eyes locked, then [Sha Cha] once again swung at [Cui Jie], scratching the latter's chest. After [Cui Jie] scratched [Sha Cha]'s arm, he knocked off the latter's hat, then grabbed one of his hands and knocked a cleaver out of it.
1:15:37|1:16:2|[Sha Cha] quickly grabbed [Cui Jie]'s shoulder, turned him around with his head, and then raised the cleaver to chop down. The latter dodged with a strong flip and kicked [Sha Cha] away. As [Sha Cha] got up, he kicked towards [Cui Jie]'s chest, and the two men wrestled again. At this moment, something broke the workshop's glass and was thrown in - it turned out to be tear gas. Soon, under the effect of tear gas, the entire factory was slowly covered in thick smoke. [Cui Jie] and [Sha Cha] continued to fight fiercely.
1:16:3|1:16:18|On the other side, the police officers entered from the corridor with infrared lights, and when they saw someone, they immediately started shooting. Inside the workshop, tear gas canisters were still being thrown in. [Li Zhongzhi] covered his mouth and nose with one hand, and tried to stand up by holding onto the railing with the other hand. In the corridor, the police officers continued to shoot at anyone they saw.
1:16:18|1:16:36|Continuing to move towards the interior of the factory after dealing with one, on the other side of the aisle, the henchmen knocked down by [Li Zhongzhi] were struggling on the ground, covering their mouths and noses. In the workshop, [Cui Jie] and [Sha Cha] had to stop fighting due to tear gas, coughing continuously. At this moment, the police had already turned into the goods passage, while [Li Zhongzhi] looked towards the fighting [Cui Jie] with his mouth and nose covered.
1:16:36|1:16:57|Earlier, the henchmen who were knocked down by [Li Zhongzhi] helped each other into the pork cold storage room. During the fight between [Cui Jie] and [Sha Cha], the henchmen entered the workshop one after another through the cold storage room. At this time, the police who had already chased to the door of the cold storage room saw someone ahead firing again. Subsequently, a large number of police officers rushed into the workshop and opened fire at anyone standing, causing the henchmen who had just run in to fall to the ground instantly.
1:16:57|1:17:14|Facing away from the door, [Sha Cha] was also hit in the shoulder. Then another wave of police officers stopped at the door, continuing to shoot inside. The man in the cap sitting on the ground hadn't had time to run yet, and was shot in the chest by stray bullets. His henchman hiding behind a cement pillar wanted to find another place to hide, but was shot in the back after running just a few steps. Seeing this, another henchman also wanted to escape.
1:17:14|1:17:30|Having been shot in the shoulder as well, with the people at the door almost cleared out, the police entered the workshop and continued to shoot underground. A stray bullet hit the railing next to Li Zhongzhi's head, causing him to quickly lie down on the ground. Cui Jie noticed this and swiftly flipped over to Li Zhongzhi's side, lifting one of his arms and placing him on his shoulder.
1:17:30|1:17:43|Struggling to move forward, the police kept firing. [Cui Jie] quickly helped [Li Zhongzhi] to move inside, opened a door and left the workshop. As the door was about to close, a hand from inside gently closed it while holding the handle.
1:17:43|1:17:50|At this moment, the police in the workshop no longer attack as fiercely as before, but cautiously grope around, occasionally kicking the people lying on the ground with their feet.
1:17:50|1:18:4|Inside the door, [Cui Jie] supported [Li Zhongzhi] as he opened the door curtain and walked in unsteadily. After placing the latter on a swivel chair, he kept coughing. [Li Zhongzhi], who was sitting with his head down on the swivel chair, slowly looked around and noticed medicine bottles and bloodstains everywhere. Gasping for breath, [Cui Jie] said, "They came here."
1:18:5|1:18:12|Even if it means destroying this place, I will take your life. [Li Zhongzhi] is sweating profusely as he sways and leans on the swivel chair, observing.
1:18:14|1:18:17|After catching his breath, [Li Zhongzhi] heard [Cui Jie] say to him,
1:18:36|1:18:45|After turning his head, Li Zhongzhi shook vigorously, squinted his eyes, trembled his lips, then swallowed hard and said in a low voice.
1:18:46|1:19:4|[Li Zhongzhi] shook his head again, gasping for breath, then looked at the plastic door curtain in front of him, stained with blood. He took a step forward but fell to the ground. Upon hearing this, [Cui Jie] immediately turned around to help him, but [Li Zhongzhi] pushed him away. He then propped his elbow on the swivel chair and slowly lifted his upper body onto the seat.
1:20:37|1:20:55|Then both sides continued to strike with fists, [Cui Jie] hit [Sha Cha]'s arm in one attack, then struck the latter's temple with one hand, and kicked him onto a small treatment cart. The cart was knocked over and an oxygen tank and a large bag of cotton swabs fell out from inside. [Cui Jie] approached [Sha Cha] from above, trying to pull him up, but suddenly the latter picked up the oxygen tank and viciously smashed it down.
1:20:56|1:21:18|Then [Sha Cha] sprayed towards [Cui Jie]'s face, who was hit on the temple again and fell to the ground. [Sha Cha], exhausted, also knelt on the ground. Both of them unconsciously spat at each other, lacking the strength to continue fighting. Seeing this, [Sha Cha] relaxed and lay down in front of a large freezer. [Li Zhongzhi] was opening the doors of the freezers one by one, finding several empty ones. Finally, he pulled open one freezer door and inside,
1:21:18|1:21:40|Li Zhongzhi finally found something inside, so he pulled the cart tray below to slowly move it out. On the tray was a piece of cloth dipped in blood. [Li Zhongzhi] lowered his head to look at the cloth, slowly lowered his right hand from the freezer door, then tightly grasped both sides of the cloth and slowly lifted it, revealing black short hair and a pair of eyebrows below. At this moment, sweat from [Li Zhongzhi] gathered on his chin and dripped down.
1:21:40|1:22:2|Then he widened his bloodshot eyes, his eyeballs swaying from side to side. Tears streamed down his cheeks as he looked down to his left, his trembling lips opening and closing. He then slowly moved the white cloth to his neck. The person had a pale face with bloodstains on his cheeks. Seeing this, [Li Zhongzhi] opened his mouth wide, trembling intensely.
1:22:2|1:22:11|Tears, snot, and sweat then flowed down his cheeks, and after gritting his teeth, he opened his mouth wide, closed his eyes tightly, and roared towards the ceiling.
1:22:11|1:22:30|At this moment, from the side, the person lying on the tray was finally seen clearly. He was [Li Zhongzhi]'s daughter [Li Yongzhi]. After roaring towards the sky several times, [Li Zhongzhi] turned his gaze back to [Li Yongzhi]'s face. His saliva mixed with tears kept dripping on the ground. Then he slowly closed his eyes, sniffed, and swallowed a few mouthfuls of saliva.
1:22:30|1:22:54|With his hand on [Li Yongzhi]'s neck, [Li Zhongzhi] slowly leaned his forehead against hers. As he cried, [Li Zhongzhi] unconsciously rubbed his cheek against [Li Yongzhi]'s hair. Then he kept shaking his head, as if unwilling to believe that his precious daughter was lying there. Finally, he swallowed hard and said softly,
1:22:55|1:23:9|Li Zhongzhi's forehead slowly left Li Yongzhi, then he released his hands and knelt weakly on the ground. The beard that had not been shaved for days due to searching for his daughter was now wet with sweat and tears. He looked helplessly at the ground, breathing heavily, trying to calm his emotions.
1:23:9|1:23:35|The cold air in the freezer kept rushing towards [Li Zhongzhi], then he slowly raised his head to look at the bottom of the tray, then tilted his head up to look at the top of [Li Yongzhi]'s head. After taking a deep breath, he slowly raised his right hand to grab the tray, then placed his left hand on it, pulling himself up from the ground. As he stood up bent over, [Li Zhongzhi] kept staring at [Li Yongzhi]'s face, tears continuously dripping from his cheeks. His lips trembled unconsciously, then he slowly raised his hands and placed them on [Li Yongzhi]'s face.
1:23:36|1:23:50|[Li Zhongzhi] carefully wiped away the still wet bloodstains on [Li Yongzhi]'s face, touched her cheek, then placed his hands on her head, slowly smoothing her messy short hair behind her ears. After finishing, [Li Zhongzhi] looked at [Li Yongzhi], then withdrew his right hand and took something out of his pocket.
1:23:50|1:23:56|To the left of Li Yongzhi, who was digging as he walked, he gently took the latter's left wrist out of the sleeve.
1:23:56|1:24:14|Originally in Li Zhongzhi's pocket was the bracelet he had previously given to Li Yongzhi. Carefully, he wrapped the bracelet around her wrist, but due to his trembling hands, he couldn't fasten the clasp. Finally, Li Zhongzhi hung the bracelet on Li Yongzhi's wrist, then he took her small hand and placed it near his lips.
1:24:14|1:24:24|He swallowed his saliva lightly, sniffed, then looked again at the lying Li Yongzhi, closed his eyes tightly, gritted his teeth, shook his head, and slowly put Li Yongzhi's left hand back.
1:24:24|1:24:48|Li Zhongzhi took a few deep breaths, tears, snot, and sweat mixed together once again, dripping down. He gritted his teeth, trembling chin fiercely opened his eyes, staring at Li Yongzhi firmly. He swallowed saliva, while outside in the corridor, Cui Jie was still lying on the ground motionless. Sha Cha picked up a 20-centimeter long steel knife from the operating table and crawled towards Cui Jie. At this moment, Li Zhongzhi grabbed Sha Cha from behind and then held her with his left hand.
1:24:48|1:25:11|His right wrist holding the knife, his right hand pulling the opponent's arm, dragging it backwards while aligning the sharp blade of the knife with [Sha Cha]'s neck. [Cui Jie], unable to move, could only lie on the ground watching [Li Zhongzhi] exerting force. At this moment, [Sha Cha] forcefully pulled [Li Zhongzhi]'s hands, trying to move the blade away from his neck. Seeing the opponent about to break free, [Li Zhongzhi] suddenly lowered his head and fiercely bit down on [Sha Cha]'s right ear. The latter, due to the sudden pain, kept kicking the ground with both feet.
1:25:11|1:25:24|Li Zhongzhi then forcefully turned his whole body to the right rear, the blade piercing into Sha Cha's neck, blood spraying onto Li Zhongzhi's left wrist like a fountain. Then, with another forceful motion, he threw Sha Cha directly to the ground, the steel knife also flung out.
1:25:24|1:25:33|[Sha Cha] died, [Li Zhongzhi] sat leaning against the console, gasping for breath, blood trickling from his mouth, but he just stared wide-eyed at the lifeless [Sha Cha].
1:25:33|1:25:47|At this moment, [Cui Jie] propped up his upper body with both hands and glanced at [Li Zhongzhi] sitting down, then looked at [Sha Cha]. At the same time, Director [局长] pursed his lips and furrowed his brow, wearing a bulletproof vest as he slowly walked in from the aisle, his gaze directed towards [Li Zhongzhi] beside him.
1:25:47|1:26:8|Then Director Cai aimed the gun at the latter's forehead. Seeing this, Cui Jie shouted while lying on the ground that they were the police. Director Cai turned to look at Cui Jie, narrowed his eyes, gently shook the gun, then turned back to see the defiant look in Li Zhongzhi's eyes. Director Cai took a deep breath, lowered the gun, and then looked back at the lying Cui Jie, squinted his eyes, and took out a cellphone from his pants pocket.
1:26:8|1:26:37|After taking it out, he pressed the screen again, and then heard a woman's scream. Director Cai aimed the phone screen at Cui Jie, who immediately crawled over with all limbs and snatched the phone. After looking at it, Cui Jie suddenly started gasping for breath, then couldn't help but cry out. It turned out that inside was Sang Er, who was sitting in a hospital gown on a chair, with both hands tied to the chair and mouth tightly taped shut. Li Zhongzhi, sitting next to him, also saw this scene. Hearing Sang Er's continuous cries for help, he gasped and tightly closed his eyes.
1:26:37|1:26:46|After thinking for a moment, Li Zhongzhi furrowed his brow, swallowed hard, and turned his head to the side to speak.
1:26:47|1:27:5|Hearing this, [Cui Jie], who was crying, turned to look at [Li Zhongzhi]. He kept gasping for breath, his eyes looking at [Li Zhongzhi] as if asking how to save. At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] opened his eyes, and the scene shifted to a car driving forward in the darkness with its headlights on. As the headlights shone, the towering trees around became visible, and the deserted path,
1:27:6|1:27:18|[Cui Jie] drove silently, with [Li Zhongzhi] sitting next to him staring out the window. Suddenly, [Li Zhongzhi] pursed his lips, pulled the handbrake of the car, then grabbed the handcuffs hanging on [Cui Jie]'s pants and handcuffed himself to the steering wheel.
1:27:18|1:27:40|At the same time, [Li Zhongzhi] snatched the pistol carried by [Cui Jie], took a look at the latter, turned off the car lights and walked down, staggering forward. He dropped [Cui Jie]'s car keys and handcuff keys, stepped over the neatly trimmed lawn, and slowly made his way towards the destination. At this moment, a palace-like house appeared, it turned out to be [Aziz]'s home. He was lying on a hospital bed inhaling oxygen, while [Zheng Hanshou] complained about...
1:27:56|1:28:0|After the explanation, [Zheng Hanshou] said to [Aziz] that all he needed to do now was to rest well. Upon hearing this, the latter slowly closed his eyes and fell asleep.
1:28:0|1:28:13|A dark figure is slowly making its way through the high trees, and through the dim light ahead, it is discovered that the person limping and walking crookedly is [Li Zhongzhi]. Slowly, he walks onto a vast lawn, with warm light shining through the windows ahead.
1:28:13|1:28:38|Walking across the lawn, [Li Zhongzhi] arrived at the path outside the window. The warm light inside the window cast a serious look on his face. He looked inside and saw a birthday party going on, with a dozen people sitting around the dining table chatting. A group of children were running around the table, making the scene lively. [Li Zhongzhi], who was walking and looking around, turned his head back and walked forward blankly. On the floor next to the dining table, there were gift boxes piled half a person high, and the cameras and flashes kept going off.
1:28:38|1:28:44|The children happily ran and jumped with lollipops in their hands, while outside the house, [Li Zhongzhi] gritted his teeth, took out a gun from his pocket, and continued to walk forward in a crooked manner.
1:28:47|1:29:8|Then the camera cuts back to the room, where the photographer is taking a family photo of four people, while another person is filming three kids playing. Finally, Li Zhongzhi, who was walking forward absentmindedly, crosses through the restaurant and stops by a tree with lights. From there, he sees Zheng Hanshou's figure through the window. The latter gives some instructions to a standing nurse and then heads towards the restaurant.
1:29:8|1:29:13|After watching the direction the nurse left and then glancing at [Zheng Hanshou], [Li Zhongzhi] gritted his teeth and continued to move forward.
1:29:14|1:29:34|At this moment, [Zheng Hanshou] has arrived at the entrance of the restaurant, which is decorated with cute balloons. After another round of photos, the room erupted in enthusiastic applause. The applause traveled through the window and reached the ears of [Li Zhongzhi] outside. He slowly stopped in his tracks, turned his head towards the house, then his eyes shifted to the left as he pursed his lips and took slow steps forward.
1:29:34|1:29:41|The scene cuts back to the restaurant, where [Zheng Hanshou] is squatting next to a little girl in a skirt, wishing her a happy birthday.
1:29:46|1:30:9|Then he picked up the lollipop on the table and handed it over. Jiajia was about to pick it up but was told by the latter that she could only have it if she smiled. So Jiajia had to grin before she could get the lollipop from [Zheng Hanshou]. After grinning, she quickly lowered her head. Outside the house, [Li Zhongzhi] climbed the steps, tried to pull a door behind which he couldn't open, then he continued to walk towards another door in a crooked manner. When he reached the door, he paused for a moment, then tried to pull the door with his left hand.
1:30:9|1:30:32|The door unexpectedly opened, and the movement of the door caused the curtains to sway. Then [Li Zhongzhi] took a step into the room. The nurse who was just sitting next to [Aziz] taking care of him saw [Li Zhongzhi] and took a deep breath. The latter then locked her in the compartment. At this moment, [Zheng Hanshou] had his back to the restaurant door, and [Li Zhongzhi] happened to walk past from the opposite direction. The former turned around to look, but didn't notice anything unusual, then turned back to the restaurant and smiled at everyone.
1:30:33|1:30:57|At this moment, [Aziz] was quietly sleeping on the hospital bed while inhaling oxygen. A family photo was placed on the table next to him. Seeing this, [Li Zhongzhi] walked over in a crooked manner and stood next to [Aziz]. He stared fixedly at the position of Aziz's chest, then placed the hand holding the gun on the edge of the bed. Slowly bending down, he pressed his right ear against Aziz's chest. Through the thick blanket, [Li Zhongzhi] heard the sound of the heartbeat.
1:30:58|1:31:18|With each heartbeat he heard, his eyeballs would twitch, [Li Zhongzhi] leaned against [Aziz]'s chest in an almost trance-like state, listening to the strong heartbeat. Unable to hold back any longer, tears welled up in the corners of his eyes, and then the head pressed against [Aziz]'s chest began to tremble continuously. Finally, tears fell from the corners of [Li Zhongzhi]'s eyes.
1:31:18|1:31:30|He gasped against [Aziz]'s chest, hearing the heartbeat getting louder. He could no longer control his emotions, furrowing his brows, flaring his nostrils, trembling lips slowly closing his eyes, as if he could still feel [Li Yongzhi] in this world.
1:31:30|1:31:39|And greeted himself. Upon hearing the voice, [Li Zhongzhi] instantly opened his eyes and saw [Zheng Hanshou] standing by the door.
1:31:40|1:31:58|At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] glared fiercely, slowly moved his right ear away from [Aziz]'s chest, stood up straight, took a deep breath, held a gun, and walked step by step towards [Zheng Hanshou]. As he approached, [Zheng Hanshou] also slowly walked from the door towards the room. Then, with tears in his eyes, [Li Zhongzhi] asked [Zheng Hanshou] a serious question.
1:32:6|1:32:12|In the midst of the conversation, [Li Zhongzhi] had already stood at the door, while [Zheng Hanshou] came to the right front of [Aziz] and stared straight at [Li Zhongzhi].
1:32:18|1:32:24|Hearing [Zheng Hanshou] compare the issue to a natural disaster, [Li Zhongzhi] gritted his teeth and stared at him, then listened further.
1:32:27|1:32:45|[Zheng Hanshou] explained with red eyes, [Li Zhongzhi] first sniffed, then gritted his teeth, turned around and didn't want to look at [Zheng Hanshou] again. Suddenly, he saw a group of people walking from the restaurant through the gate. It turned out to be Jiajia holding a birthday cake and a whole bunch of people walking towards this room.
1:32:46|1:33:9|Shortly after [Li Zhongzhi] cleared his throat and glanced at [Zheng Hanshou], he slowly moved towards the door. Upon reaching the door, he saw a large group of people coming out of the restaurant across the street, walking towards him. Jiajia was at the front of the group, holding a cake and smiling happily. [Li Zhongzhi] used his left hand to slowly close the door.
1:33:12|1:33:36|The door was completely closed by him, then [Zheng Hanshou] nodded at him, and [Li Zhongzhi] turned around, raised his hand and fired a shot at [Zheng Hanshou]'s forehead. The gunshot echoed throughout the room, [Aziz] inside the room instantly opened his eyes and woke up, while Jiajia and the family outside also stopped in their tracks, looking towards the direction of the door. Then the camera focused on [Zheng Hanshou], a hole was shot right in the center of his forehead, as he fell backwards on the ground, his eyes still open.
1:33:36|1:33:47|After taking down Zheng Hanshou with one shot, Li Zhongzhi slowly lowered his raised gun hand, then looked at Aziz to his right with red eyes. Aziz looked back at him, smiled, and then drifted into his memories.
1:33:47|1:33:53|In the scene, [Li Zhongzhi] is sitting in the car, staring blankly at his phone, then smiles at the screen.
1:33:56|1:34:4|It turns out to be a selfie video of [Li Yongzhi], which was taken during a walk by the sea.
1:34:15|1:34:22|[Li Yongzhi] looked at the sea and raised her hand to touch the bracelet on her left wrist.
1:34:38|1:34:53|Then she sat on the embankment with a backpack, lowered her head to tighten the bracelet, smiled, and spoke to the phone. After that, she raised her arm, held up the bracelet in front of the phone, took a deep breath, and slowly finished taking a selfie.
1:34:53|1:35:17|At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] remembered the family photo of the three of them. He was sitting on the slide, holding [Li Yongzhi] and Xue'er, smiling happily at the camera. As the memory faded, he smiled again in the direction of [Aziz], then raised the gun and pressed it against his own temple. After taking a deep breath and furrowing his brow, [Li Zhongzhi] smiled at [Aziz] with red eyes. The camera then moved outside, showing [Aziz]'s house surrounded by warm lights.
1:35:17|1:35:29|A gunshot shattered the warmth, at this moment, a hand cuffed to the steering wheel, [Cui Jie], looked towards the direction of the gunshot. Then he lowered his head, bent over, and gasped for air heavily. Finally, unable to hold back, he tightly closed his eyes and tears streamed down his face.
1:35:29|1:35:54|After a moment of calm, he looked up again towards the front of the car as if he had made up his mind. Then the screen went black, and the figure of [Cui Jie] appeared in the frame. He sat with his hands crossed on a bench in the corridor, as a nurse slowly walked past in the corridor shot. On the other side, [Sang Er] was lying on the operating table with a surgical cap on, while a doctor was guiding her to exert force and cheering her on. [Sang Er] cried and exerted herself, then finally looked down and smiled.
