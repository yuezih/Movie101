0:1:6|0:1:11|At this moment, they are conducting physical training around the training ground.
0:1:57|0:2:16|On the training ground is the figure of [Liu Li] practicing, with a boyish short haircut. She shouts loudly to boost her morale while practicing in the air. Yang Hui looks at [Liu Li]. Shuihuo, Xiaoyue, and Yang Hui hold timers in their hands, looking smugly at Liu Li.
0:2:20|0:2:34|Yang Hui propped herself up and glanced at the timer, saying to [Liu Li]. [Liu Li], who had been practicing vigorously, stopped and looked exhausted. Sweat soaked her hair as she rested her hands on her knees and slowly counted to two.
0:3:2|0:3:5|Liu Li pulled Yang Hui and playfully pushed her down with a smile.
0:3:12|0:3:38|Our shared life journey has created a deep connection between the two of us, who are not quite like typical girls. There is a kind of emotional bond that doesn't need words. We don't know what she is, but we are pleasantly surprised to see her, becoming more intense with each passing day.
0:4:1|0:4:4|The two hurriedly scattered a handful of banknotes.
0:4:44|0:4:46|At this moment, [Liu Li] grabbed the money and ran outside.
0:4:51|0:5:4|[Liu Li] ran all the way from the changing room to the venue, clutching the few bills in her hand. However, the glass door of the venue was locked. She pounded on the door with all her might, memories of her childhood flashing through her mind.
0:5:4|0:5:14|At that time, [Liu Li] brought Yang Hui to the doorstep. Yang Hui's mother, with a dark expression, pushed open the door, pulled Yang Hui in, and then looked at the boyish [Liu Li] with disdain, saying,
0:5:21|0:5:41|[Liu Li] left Yang Hui's house while making faces. Yang Hui's mother then glanced at the deep-rooted Yang Hui. Yang Hui completely ignored her mother's scolding, making faces at her while going upstairs.
0:5:44|0:6:2|He pulled Yang Hui's arm, at this moment, [Liu Li] climbed onto the roof. After Yang Hui's mother finished speaking, she angrily grabbed a basin to fetch hot water, while Yang Hui stood by, feeling wronged, and looked up to see [Liu Li] practicing martial arts on the roof.
0:6:11|0:6:17|Yang Hui's mother was about to wipe her daughter's hands, only to find them covered in blood, but Yang Hui remained silent.
0:6:31|0:6:37|The mischievous [Liu Li] was still on the roof watching Yang Hui and her mother. When Yang Hui's mother turned around, [Liu Li] stuck her tongue out at her.
0:6:43|0:6:53|Speaking, she splashed a bucket of water towards him. At this moment, a call brought him back to reality. [Liu Li] nodded absentmindedly. The old man glanced at her and reminded her.
0:6:57|0:7:1|[Liu Li] took a few steps back towards the old man, with a hint of numbness in her eyes.
0:7:13|0:7:26|Suddenly, [Liu Li] remembered that she still had to call for training, so she ran back to the training ground. When she returned to the team, Coach Yang Huichun asked if [Liu Li]'s mother was there, and [Liu Li] shook her head firmly, secretly returning the money in her hand to her.
0:7:26|0:7:34|Unexpectedly, this scene was caught by the coach's sharp eyes. She fiercely hit Liu Li's hand with the stick in her hand, causing money to scatter all over the ground.
0:7:37|0:7:51|[Liu Li] reluctantly stood in place and followed everyone to start physical training. The students were seen continuously swinging the jump ropes in their hands, then immediately kicking their legs in the air to enhance their personal endurance, balance, and explosive power, sweating profusely.
0:7:51|0:7:58|[Liu Li] and Yang Hui were also among them, their expressions determined, each kick accompanied by a loud roar of anger.
0:7:58|0:8:22|Even though their hair was completely soaked with sweat, the students practiced with each other. While others used their feet, [Liu Li] kicked one after another with all her strength. By the time lunchtime arrived, [Liu Li] saw a long line at the cafeteria and squeezed into a queue full of boys. At this moment, the boys behind her were not happy.
0:8:22|0:8:26|[Liu Li] was not convinced, almost raising her fist, while the young man behind her glanced at her.
0:8:32|0:8:35|[Liu Li] proudly jumps and whistles in the line.
0:8:49|0:8:59|[Liu Li] took the tray and Han Bing quickly followed to serve the dishes. [Liu Li] gave her a disdainful look and went to find Yang Hui. Just as they were about to enjoy lunch, their teammate Chen Jia sat down opposite them.
0:9:27|0:9:43|Unexpectedly, the new coach Han Bing has barged into my life like this. It seems that accidents always contain inevitabilities. Back in the dormitory, [Liu Li] lay down next to Yang Hui for a short rest. Yang Hui gently stroked her head while seemingly pondering something.
0:9:43|0:9:48|Not long after, a foul smell came from above, and [Liu Li] stood up to investigate.
0:10:6|0:10:12|Liu Li gently brushed away the tears on Yang Hui's face as she cried, comforting her tenderly.
0:10:29|0:10:34|Yang Hui pulled out a sharp pair of scissors, leaving [Liu Li] dumbfounded. She took the scissors and looked at Yang Hui.
0:10:39|0:10:43|[Liu Li] was puzzled and gave a glance before continuing to ask.
0:10:51|0:11:0|Yang Hui played with the scissors in her hand while looking at [Liu Li], whose gaze remained fixed on the scissors. She took the scissors and a childhood memory flashed through her mind.
0:11:19|0:11:34|At that time, Yang Hui's mother was singing in the house, and the beautiful singing attracted Liu Li. Liu Li knew that Yang Hui's mother disliked him, so he could only stand aside and sneakily peek from the opposite side of the roof, cautiously sticking his head out to steal a glance.
0:11:34|0:11:38|Liu Li's mother stood gracefully at the door, her enchanting voice echoing from inside the house.
0:11:39|0:12:1|At this moment, Yang Hui was secretly cutting her hair in front of the mirror with a serious and mysterious expression. Just as [Liu Li] was about to climb over the roof, Yang Hui's mother noticed that the scissors were missing. In a panic, the scissors fell to the ground, but her mother suddenly walked in.
0:12:13|0:12:23|The tragic mother and daughter embraced tightly, with Yang Hui's mother picking up the scissors helplessly, carefully trimming Yang Hui's uneven hair, shedding tears and blaming Yang Hui at the same time.
0:12:26|0:12:37|Yang Hui also shed tears, holding up a mirror to look at her tomboyish appearance. Her chaotic thoughts were brought back to reality, only to see the new coach, Han Bing, standing in the training ground indoors.
0:12:37|0:12:47|The training props were randomly placed by the students, with specialized foot grips and gloves on the ground, as well as four tires stacked very solidly, already half the height of Han Bing.
0:12:47|0:13:2|He stood there lost in thought for a moment, first lying quietly on the tire, his eyes aimlessly staring at the ceiling, then suddenly getting up and walking to another place. He casually picked up a footrest and vigorously gestured a few times towards Quanxing.
0:13:2|0:13:12|Finally, he stood in the center of the training ground, looked around, placed his hands behind his back, and walked calmly towards the outdoors. Outside the window, thunder rumbled, and the students were all standing on the track.
0:14:8|0:14:17|Hearing this, Team Liu Li and Chen Jia started playing around, gesturing for each other to go up first. Han Bing stopped Chen Jia, and the smile on Chen Jia's face instantly froze.
0:14:23|0:14:34|Han Bing kicked Chen Jia's leg hard, almost causing her to fall down. Then Han Bing rushed over. The assistant coach had already been drenched in rain, but Han Bing continued to call out for Yang Hui's first love.
0:15:2|0:15:8|Finally, Yang Hui screamed and kicked towards him, Liu Li wiped away the rain, and the next second, Yang Hui stood in the rain.
0:15:12|0:15:22|Yang Hui stood up discontentedly and returned to the team, while [Liu Li] clenched her fists secretly and made a cheering gesture, but was pushed away by Yang Hui. Then, Han Bing stood in front of [Liu Li].
0:15:25|0:15:28|Liu Li still had a look that seemed unrelated to herself.
0:15:44|0:15:50|Han Bing kicked [Liu Li] in the chest, causing [Liu Li] to stumble and fall to the ground.
0:15:57|0:16:14|[Liu Li] knelt on the ground, showing an attitude that was completely at odds with Han Bing. Surprisingly, she then changed her posture, first crossing her legs, and then sang "Conquer" passionately, raising her head high and singing loudly, even spitting on the ground. Han Bing was helpless against her.
0:17:1|0:17:6|Han Bing's gift was unforgettable for a lifetime.
0:17:13|0:17:19|Being there in person, even the strongest man can't bear it.
0:17:24|0:17:31|The scene cuts to Liu Li lying on the sofa in the dormitory. Yang Hui tries to help her change out of her wet clothes, but is pushed away by Liu Li.
0:17:59|0:18:11|[Liu Li] let out a long sigh. That night, Yang Hui limped into the laundry room and encountered Han Bing, who was lying on the table reading a book. Yang Hui turned and left as if she had seen a mortal enemy, while Han Bing turned back to look after hearing the noise.
0:18:22|0:18:33|Han Bing furrowed her brows, got up briskly from the table, and walked over to [Yang Hui] in a straightforward manner. Faced with her question about death, [Yang Hui] found herself unable to speak for a moment.
0:18:36|0:18:40|Han Bing snatched the laundry detergent from [Yang Hui]'s hand and threw it directly on the ground.
0:18:41|0:18:55|[Yang Hui] was stunned for a moment, awkwardly pursed her lips, pinched the corner of her clothes, and dared not look directly at her. Han Bing did not speak, but instead took out all the clothes from the washing machine next to her. Then, she walked behind [Yang Hui], clapped her hands, and put her hands in her pockets.
0:18:58|0:19:5|[Yang Hui] stood with hands behind his back, looking like a guilty child. [Han Bing] turned coldly to glance at him, then put down the magazine.
0:19:7|0:19:23|[Yang Hui] stood still scratching her head. Only then did [Yang Hui] drag her leg with all her strength to walk up to him. Han Bing, with a cold expression, put down the magazine in her hand, only to see [Yang Hui] put her foot on the empty space on the table.
0:19:26|0:19:33|Han Bing lifted her leg directly, [Yang Hui] showed no willingness and remained silent. Just then, a dark figure appeared at the door, it was [Liu Li].
0:19:35|0:19:51|[Yang Hui] glanced at Han Bing, put down her legs. [Yang Hui] pushed Han Bing away, skillfully moved her legs aside, and walked to the washing machine. Han Bing's good intentions were misunderstood, she was just tidying up the books in her hands and continued speaking.
0:19:55|0:20:10|After saying that, Han Bing left the laundry room without looking back. Standing at the door, [Liu Li] heard the conversation, walked into the laundry room, glared fiercely at Han Bing, made a boxing gesture in anger to vent his dissatisfaction, and muttered a few words under his breath.
0:20:10|0:20:15|Later, she walked up to [Yang Wei] with her hands in her pockets, seeing him lost in thought, and snatched the laundry detergent from his hands.
0:20:21|0:20:26|[Liu Li] placed the laundry detergent aside and the two fell silent for a moment. Unable to hold back, [Liu Li] spoke up.
0:20:28|0:20:31|[Yang Hui] put down the clothes in her hand, chuckled and retorted.
0:20:37|0:20:45|[Liu Li] gave [Yang Hui] a glance. In the end, [Liu Li] continued to put clothes into the washing machine, with a look of calm and disdain.
0:20:56|0:21:0|[Liu Li] suddenly slams the washing machine shut, making a loud, heavy sound.
0:21:13|0:21:21|The two remained silent as they admired, with Liu Li widening his eyes and Yang Hui defending once again. Liu Li looked at her in astonishment, as if he had heard a joke.
0:21:24|0:21:27|[Yang Hui] flashed a hint of shyness in her eyes. She turned her head and giggled softly.
0:21:55|0:22:6|The two finished speaking and leaned against each other, almost falling to the ground. Han Bing listened without saying a word, continuing to ask questions. [Liu Li] was a bit careless, not giving face to Han Bing, and weakly answered.
0:22:36|0:22:40|So this level is also known as the death level.
0:22:50|0:23:8|[Liu Li] looked determined. The next morning, just as the day was breaking, she led the students in a devilish morning run on the main road, riding a bike at the front of the group while everyone followed behind her. She urged each student to go faster, even faster. Liu Li, in order to prove herself, kept running at the very front of the group.
0:23:8|0:23:13|They crossed the pedestrian crossing, walked around in circles, and then ran into the wild grass by the side of the road.
0:23:14|0:23:33|[Liu Li] was sometimes at the front of the line, and sometimes at the back, catching students who fell behind. Some students were clearly exhausted, but [Liu Li] didn't let them off. The winter dawn enveloped them, but this group of students felt no warmth at all. They moved forward like puppets, with loose and disorderly movements.
0:23:33|0:23:42|My ghostly training is unbearable for everyone, but they all persevere and move forward. [Liu Li] looks pale at this moment, with her teammates trying to talk to her on the side.
0:23:50|0:23:56|The Birdman sat down by the roadside, panting heavily, when Yang Hui ran back and desperately grabbed Liu Li.
0:24:56|0:25:2|For three consecutive days, a marathon each day, the cold ice is pushing me like a devil.
0:25:31|0:25:47|Whenever [Liu Li] was too exhausted to continue, Han Bing would carry the bicycle and try to pass over her. [Liu Li] had to obediently eat the dust and keep running. It was a bitterly cold winter day, with [Liu Li] wearing a down vest while Han Bing only had on a thin sweatshirt.
0:25:47|0:25:59|[Liu Li] kept hearing Han Bing's voice in her ear, urging her to get up and continue. Whenever [Liu Li] felt disheartened and collapsed on the grass, Han Bing would find ways to motivate her, with a look of tough love.
0:26:0|0:26:25|Sometimes even Han Bing himself was too exhausted to stand up with [Liu Li], but he would still pull [Liu Li] up, determined to crawl to the finish line. Han Bing fell to the ground in frustration, while [Liu Li] was lying on the grass, using the weak strength from her elbows to move forward.
0:26:31|0:26:37|[Liu Li] gritted her teeth, tearing at the grass with her hands, blood from the wounds on her hands leaving a trail as she crawled, her face contorted in a fierce roar.
0:26:48|0:26:59|At this moment, [Liu Li] couldn't tell if it was sweat or tears, feeling like there were always droplets on his face. One step, two steps, three steps, Han Bing showed no intention of letting him stop, just telling him that this was the last twenty meters.
0:27:10|0:27:25|Liu Li climbed up with a furrowed brow, maintaining his original posture, using the last bit of his meager strength to complete the final 20 meters. Afterwards, he buried his head in the grass, completely unable to get up, his hands leaving bloodstains from the long-term friction with the ground.
0:27:25|0:27:37|Han Bing stood behind him, letting him vent freely, to no avail. [Liu Li] was exhausted, finding it difficult to even breathe. Finally, the training session ended, and she returned to the dormitory.
0:27:50|0:28:2|The angry roar silenced everyone. He walked to the shower, turned on the tap, didn't even take off his clothes, and showered directly. The water column lay on his body, devouring the last warmth.
0:28:13|0:28:27|At this moment, Yang Hui was casually drying her hair, showing no concern at all, without a hint of comfort. [Liu Li]'s face was covered with weeds and scars, and she threw the headband on the ground.
0:28:52|0:28:55|[Liu Li] shook her head with her hands on her head, making a heavy compromise.
0:29:1|0:29:4|Yang Hui ignored [Liu Li] and let her hammer the gun with her fists.
0:29:11|0:29:25|In Liu Li's mind flashed the scene of practicing fencing in childhood. It was a cold winter day, the ground was covered in ice, Liu Li and Yang Hui's faces were frozen pale, both wearing ice skates, holding long bamboo poles.
0:29:25|0:29:34|In front of him, the old man with a forked beard used a flowing sword technique, catching Liu Li off guard. This is Liu Li's grandfather, Yang Hui, who blocked left and right, but accidentally left an opening for him.
0:29:35|0:29:51|Grandpa made a swift and sharp move, taking [Liu Li] and Yang Hui by surprise with a sword step. His swordsmanship was light as a butterfly and fast as the wind. [Liu Li] lunged at him, but Grandpa dodged, causing [Liu Li] to miss and fall hard to the ground.
0:29:59|0:30:16|Returning to reality, [Liu Li] walks aimlessly on the training ground, looking heavily burdened, as if pondering something. Strangely, after extreme fatigue and angry outbursts, a sense of conquering oneself gradually emerges.
0:30:20|0:30:37|As time passed, [Liu Li] and Yang Hui gradually got used to the harsh training like the Ice Devil, repeating high-intensity physical training every day, rolling tires to kick legs, pulling tires, and practicing shouting. In order to make themselves more explosive on the field, shouting training is essential.
0:30:37|0:30:40|They have had thoughts of giving up more than once, but they have also persisted.
0:31:34|0:31:43|The tears of the two rolled in their eyes, and after suddenly being stopped, they fell to the ground and simply didn't get up.
0:31:54|0:32:6|It is often just a casual glance or a few words that fill each other's hearts with warmth, giving them the courage to face the next challenge.
0:32:7|0:32:25|[Liu Li] lay limp on Yang Hui's stomach, both too exhausted to get up. Meanwhile, Han Bing waited at another training ground for the assistant coach. She practiced triple jump and hurdles while holding a stopwatch in her hand. Even though she was at the training ground, her worries were elsewhere. Just then, the assistant coach approached.
0:32:45|0:32:53|The key is for the athlete to be fully focused, to adjust themselves in a short period of time, and to accept the challenge.
0:33:36|0:33:39|[Liu Li] couldn't eat, so she spit out the bread from her mouth.
0:34:15|0:34:25|[Liu Li] picked up a bucket of bottled mineral water and chugged it vigorously, spinning a few times while drinking. After belching contentedly, Yang Hui was still not satisfied.
0:34:34|0:34:40|[Liu Li] compromised helplessly, gulping down another bottle of mineral water and spilling it all over the floor.
0:35:17|0:35:31|[Liu Li] was bouncing around happily, while Yang Hui urged [Liu Li] to eat more for the competition. Meanwhile, in the equipment room on the other side, Han Bing was lying on a chair sleeping. She didn't know when she fell asleep, nor how long she had been sleeping.
0:35:31|0:35:51|At this time, there are still students training outside the equipment room, their enthusiasm high. However, the shouting wakes up Liu Li. Liu Li struggles to get up, her tired face showing signs of fatigue. It seems that this place has not been cleaned for a long time, with leftover takeout boxes, training equipment, and computers scattered around.
0:35:51|0:35:57|She picked up the cup and drank all the water in one gulp, hands in pockets. After a moment of daze, she prepared to train the students.
0:35:58|0:36:16|In order to improve the practical combat skills of Taekwondo, practice sessions for Taekwondo athletes often include sparring. The most classic and brutal form of sparring is male sparring with female. Due to the inherent physical disadvantage and the fact that their body size and physique are no match for the boys, [Liu Li] and Yang Hui were beaten badly by a group of boys.
0:36:18|0:36:36|Liu Li first failed to control the distance properly, quickly got silenced, and then was too slow in kicking and retracting, getting caught without being able to block. The lighter boys in the kilogram class were fast, while the heavier ones were strong. [Liu Li] and Yang Hui were obviously no match for them. However, in Han Bing's world, there was no room for surrender, and they had to persist and train hard.
0:36:36|0:36:53|The students were seen quickly kicking and retracting their legs amidst shouts, with [Liu Li] and Yang Hui facing attacks from all directions. Meanwhile, Han Bing was on the side supervising other students' leg movements. Even though they were wearing full protective gear, [Liu Li] and Yang Hui still ended up bruised and swollen from the hits.
0:36:53|0:37:9|Due to exhaustion, a beginner's high side kick knocked the two of them down. [Liu Li] crossed his arms to protect his head, but eventually still got kicked. There was a strong impact when his head touched the ground, followed by a huge kinetic energy pulling his body rolling on the ground.
0:37:9|0:37:14|At this moment, before [Han Bing] harshly trained them and asked them to continue training.
0:37:32|0:37:35|[Han Bing] angrily stomped his foot on the ground and slammed it heavily.
0:37:42|0:37:57|[Han Bing] fiercely knocked on [Yang Hui]'s head, and the surrounding students dared not speak. [Yang Hui] faced the ground, starting to gasp. A hint of pity flashed in [Han Bing]'s expression, but she still told the surrounding students to go back to training. Without considering the two of them, she got up directly, leaving behind only a sentence.
0:38:2|0:38:11|Han Bing's words obviously didn't work, Liu Li and Yang Hui are still lying on the ground, holding hands across the distance. Men accompanying women to practice is a very cruel training.
0:38:13|0:38:20|Liu Li looked down and saw Yang Hui's feet oozing a large amount of fresh blood. She hurried to the wardrobe and angrily accused Liu Li.
0:38:52|0:39:8|[Liu Li] changed her clothes and ran towards the training ground, completely ignoring the injured Yang Hui. Once outside the training ground, she fell hard, not caring about the dust on her body, because now she was going to smash Hanbing's bicycle. [Liu Li] first slammed the bicycle against the iron pillar and stomped on it a few times.
0:39:8|0:39:12|Yang Hui, who was rushed over by Wen Sheng, hobbled over and quickly intervened.
0:39:39|0:39:45|With a smile on her face, [Liu Li] led Yang Hui to the medical room.
0:40:31|0:40:35|The scene shifts, Han Bing is walking and chatting with the assistant coach.
0:41:16|0:41:23|On one side, the two exchanged smiles, while on the other side, Yang Hui and [Liu Li] were in the room, with [Liu Li] continuously pouring water from a bucket into her mouth.
0:41:53|0:42:14|[Liu Li] squatted down, rolled up Yang Hui's pants, carefully examined her wound, and asked. Yang Hui shook her head numbly, her eyes somewhat dim. In the brutal training, even if one is careful to avoid, it is hard to escape pain. Moreover, for the insensitive Yang Hui, does it really not hurt?
0:42:34|0:42:45|Between the windows, the horse gallops, the pig flows coins, and in the blink of an eye, the day of the competition is approaching. [Liu Li], Yang Hui, and Han Bing fly through the clouds, but there is no excitement on their faces, only deep concern.
0:42:46|0:43:10|[Liu Li] and Yang Hui stared out of the window, lost in thought, while Han Bing flipped through the magazine in her hands. Seagulls flew over the vast waterfall, just like [Liu Li] and Yang Hui traveling to Vancouver to bring glory to the country. This time they must win, and in the blink of an eye, they arrived at the competition venue.
0:43:16|0:43:29|Chinese team's best player participated in the World Taekwondo Championships held in Edmonton, Canada. Chinese female athletes [Liu Li] and Yang Hui are the most hopeful female team players to win the championship. This is their performance in the competition.
0:43:29|0:43:35|Yang Hui used the backhand technique to hit the valid scoring area of American athlete Jesse Ba, scoring the first point of the match on the first day.
0:43:37|0:43:42|Everyone cheered for the exciting outcome, and they were having a meal together in the restaurant where they lived.
0:43:50|0:44:6|[Liu Li] was stunned when she heard this, she turned to look at the unexpected guests behind her, realizing that a tough battle was about to begin. She turned back with a serious expression, took Yang Hui by the hand, and walked into the control room.
0:44:7|0:44:10|Yang Hui dragged her injured leg and walked out.
0:44:25|0:44:36|Han Bin rolled up his pants, the wound glaringly exposed to the air. He then immediately took Yang Hui to the hospital for examination. The words of the [doctor] were undoubtedly a bolt from the blue.
0:44:37|0:44:51|Her condition is medically known as dissociative sensory disorder. If she cannot regain her self-defense ability, she will miss out on Taekwondo. Upon learning the outcome, [Liu Li] was at a loss, with her previous fierce and menacing demeanor completely gone.
0:44:51|0:45:3|[Liu Li] was downstairs and heard this conversation. It was as if her soul had been sucked out. Even when a doctor passed by and greeted her, she didn't react. Soon after, Han Bing quickly found the assistant coach to discuss countermeasures.
0:45:18|0:45:28|Fate has been too cruel to Yang Hui. Just before the final battle, she lost the chance to advance.
0:45:40|0:45:48|In the hospital room, [Liu Li] is styling Yang Hui's hair, while Yang Hui seems completely indifferent and determined.
0:46:3|0:46:9|[Liu Li] knew the seriousness of Yang Hui's illness. She took a step back and sat down, starting to educate others.
0:46:40|0:46:49|In Liu Li's mind, scenes of childhood when he and Yang Hui became martial arts disciples flashed by. Grandpa Liu Li held [Yang Hui]'s hand and asked.
0:46:52|0:46:55|At this moment, [Liu Li]'s mother appeared and pulled [Liu Li] aside.
0:47:44|0:47:52|[Yang Hui]'s mother couldn't believe it, she had misunderstood all along. [Yang Hui] pushed the wheelchair and called out to the depressed Liu Li.
0:47:53|0:47:59|Liu Li came to her senses, wiping away the tears from the corner of her eyes. Seeing her distracted look, [Yang Hui] confidently comforted her.
0:48:17|0:48:22|Liu Li knew it well, but she still stopped in her tracks and angrily pounded the railing with her fist.
0:48:33|0:48:37|[Yang Hui] was angered by these words, pushing her wheelchair and stopping from walking out.
0:49:14|0:49:23|Liu Li couldn't resist him, and the just calmed emotions were ignited again. She hesitated, lightly patted [Yang Hui]'s shoulder, took a deep breath, and continued to push forward.
0:49:38|0:49:56|Yang Hui spoke while leaning on the railing, trying to find a fulcrum to stand on. [Liu Li] forcefully pressed her onto the wheelchair, shouting angrily at her. On the other side, the coaches chose to flip a coin to decide whether Yang Hui would participate in the competition. The room fell into silence.
0:50:18|0:50:28|Obviously, Yang Hui will definitely participate in this competition. Han Bing is very conflicted, scratching her head in frustration. Suddenly, the phone rings, she looks surprised, quickly gets up and runs to answer it.
0:50:47|0:50:59|Facing Yang Hui's resolute request to participate, it is unknown whether the superior leader also had a change of heart, and finally decided to allow her to compete, giving the athlete one last chance.
0:51:1|0:51:17|At this moment, [Liu Li] is helping Yang Hui change the gauze, but the wound shows no signs of improvement.
0:51:32|0:51:48|Yang Hui was stunned, staring straight at [Liu Li]. When [Liu Li] looked up and met Yang Hui's gaze, her eyes seemed to hide a sharp knife, making people dare not look directly. The usually bold [Liu Li] also obediently admitted defeat this time, and then she stood up after calming down a bit.
0:51:56|0:52:6|[Liu Li] did not get angry and continued to help her tidy up her clothes. The two remained silent. Yang Hui pouted her mouth, stared at [Liu Li], and a hint of murderous intent flashed in her eyes.
0:52:14|0:52:22|After speaking, [Liu Li] stood still and turned to walk towards the washstand, supporting the table with both hands, pondering why Yang Hui was ungrateful, as if she had a deep-seated hatred towards her.
0:52:59|0:53:2|[Liu Li] rolled her eyes as Han Bing walked up to her with hands on her hips.
0:53:36|0:53:54|The tense atmosphere between the two escalated, with Han Bing preparing to pull her to the door, but [Liu Li] pushed him away. Pointing to the door, [Liu Li] shook her head while speaking. Han Bing and [Liu Li] no longer faced each other directly, but instead moved behind her to listen to what she was saying.
0:54:11|0:54:27|With a scream from [Liu Li], Han Bing's hand landed on her face, delivering a hard slap. Han Bing hesitated for a few seconds, not realizing his own actions. Then, he simply urged [Liu Li] to go on stage. [Liu Li] stood there stunned, holding her face for a moment, not expecting to be slapped.
0:54:27|0:54:31|Perhaps both of them were so angry that their words were beyond her control.
0:54:33|0:54:44|He couldn't bear this kind of grievance, slammed the door heavily, covered his face and ran to the bathroom, sitting alone on a chair, holding his head in his hands, tears streaming down his face. After calming down, he also figured it out.
0:55:22|0:55:31|The final begins, and the audience below is already boiling with excitement, not only because this is an international competition, but also because the contestant on stage is a teammate who has been together day and night.
0:55:32|0:55:50|The thrilling scene is indeed rare to see, but it's really tough on [Liu Li]. In her mind, scenes of the two fighting each other, superhuman leg bows, spinning back kicks, etc., are constantly playing like a movie on loop. Thinking of this, [Liu Li] hangs her head dejectedly in the corner, but in fact, the match is right in front of her.
0:55:50|0:55:57|The scene shifts, Yang Hui slowly walks to the center of the venue, bowing deeply to the audience and referees, while Liu Li is still hesitating to go on court in the back.
0:55:58|0:56:11|After putting on the helmet, [Liu Li] took a deep breath, her steps slow and deliberate. Meanwhile, Han Bing waited at the coach's seat, looking at the hand she had just hit [Liu Li] with, feeling helpless and guilty. As soon as [Liu Li] stepped onto the field, the commentator's voice could be heard. [Liu Li], wearing red protective gear, is her teammate Yang Hui.
0:56:38|0:56:51|At that moment, Grandpa and Yang Hui's mother were also watching the live TV broadcast. The announcer on TV announced the news of Yang Hui's illness. Upon hearing this, Yang Hui's mother did not show surprise or shock, but quietly wiped away a tear.
0:56:51|0:57:20|The two sat around the fire, silent but with pride and satisfaction on their faces. The scene shifted to the competition venue, where the battle became more intense. Yang Hui and [Liu Li] were evenly matched, while Han Bing paced back and forth anxiously on the sidelines.
0:57:41|0:57:52|On a day after the competition, the rain had stopped and the sun was shining. [Liu Li] hurriedly walked with her suitcase, paying no attention to the shadow beneath her feet. Han Bing rode up on a bike and called out to her.
0:57:54|0:57:58|[Liu Li] kept walking forward, while Han Bing threw the car and grabbed her.
0:58:29|0:58:45|Han Bing didn't answer, she just stared at [Liu Li] for a while, then patted [Liu Li]'s shoulder, like an older brother to a younger sister. Perhaps out of guilt, Han Bing picked up [Liu Li]'s luggage, dragged it in front of [Liu Li], gesturing for her to go back first.
0:58:45|0:58:50|[Liu Li] took the luggage, sighed, and coldly rejected Han Bing's kindness.
0:59:7|0:59:10|Han Bing pointed in the direction of the exit, leaving [Liu Li] speechless with anger.
0:59:12|0:59:28|Hanbing, with a black face, scolded again. [Liu Li] glared at him, dragged the suitcase and left. Unexpectedly, the road was bumpy on a rainy day. [Liu Li] walked for a while, and the suitcase tripped and fell to the ground. She kicked it hard, venting her anger, until it hit Hanbing's back, angrily condemning him.
0:59:30|0:59:46|Say it, [Liu Li] dragged the suitcase and left without looking back. Han Bing, with an indifferent look on his face, parted ways with [Liu Li]. [Liu Li] walked angrily to the gate and hailed a taxi. It was only when the driver helped her with the luggage that she realized how deep her feelings for Taekwondo were.
0:59:47|1:0:5|But since she had made up her mind to leave, [Liu Li] just turned back and looked at the school for a long time. Despite feeling lonely and reluctant, she still got on the car. Who could have expected that the moment the car started to drive away, Han Bing suddenly ran out, chasing after the car and shouting for her to stay.
1:0:5|1:0:9|Some time later, one day, a magazine cover featuring [Liu Li] as a model appeared on the table.
1:0:14|1:0:22|In the photo, [Liu Li] is dressed provocatively, striking a seductive pose. Han Bing took a glance and tore her mouth to pieces in anger.
1:0:46|1:0:54|After Han Bing bid a respectful farewell, the assistant coach hung up the phone. Han Bing walked to the window, sighed heavily, and muttered to himself.
1:1:0|1:1:16|The next day, the streets were filled with posters of Liu Li, with Liu Li in the picture wearing heavy makeup, trendy hairstyle, avant-garde makeup, showing no signs of sweating on the competition field. Han Bing stared at the poster of [Liu Li], waving her headscarf, as if waiting for something, but at this moment, [Liu Li] was shining brightly.
1:1:17|1:1:27|[Liu Li] walks on the stage with a bold and assertive demeanor, dressed in a very eye-catching gown. Every move she makes follows the melody of the accompaniment, eliciting cheers from the audience below the stage.
1:1:27|1:1:43|Just before the performance ended, [Liu Li] still gave all the audience a charming look and smile. Unable to find [Liu Li], [Han Bing] returned to the office dejected, not knowing what to do, with a restless mood overwhelming her. She swept away the scattered papers and stood by the window, lost in thought.
1:1:43|1:1:54|At the same time, after the performance, [Liu Li] returned home and looked at the glamorous reflection in the mirror. She took out a camera and proudly imagined herself shining brightly.
1:2:29|1:2:50|At the same time, [Liu Li], feeling extremely frustrated, drank alone, downing glass after glass of baijiu. Her nostrils twitched slightly, as if tears were about to fall any second. The intense burning sensation of alcohol made her uncomfortable, and she suddenly started coughing violently.
1:2:50|1:2:52|The scene cuts to Liu Li's home, where Han Bing arrives.
1:2:53|1:3:9|The room was filled with a subtle atmosphere of renovation, with an artist's poster on the wall and an old-fashioned movie projector in the corner. Han Ming noticed a taekwondo uniform hanging on the wardrobe, which used to be [Liu Li]'s most frequently worn outfit, now neatly hung up and cleaned.
1:3:9|1:3:18|But because it hasn't been touched for a long time and has gathered dust, [Liu Li] has just put on a stylish jacket, paired with tight jeans and boots, she looks like a desert girl, which is not an exaggeration.
1:3:19|1:3:36|He walked out of the bathroom with his hands in his pockets, swaggering until he saw Han Bing. He froze, the coach he hadn't seen in a long time now seemed very unfamiliar. [Liu Li] walked forward and spoke first. Han Bing slowly turned around, looking [Liu Li] up and down.
1:3:36|1:3:40|[Liu Li] squeezed out a smile, but the next second her mouth drooped down and she shook her head.
1:3:44|1:3:54|As soon as the words fell, [Liu Li] froze, the two of them faced each other in silence. Han Bing lowered his head slightly, [Liu Li] turned around, no longer discussing the topic with him.
1:4:0|1:4:5|[Liu Li] looked at him coldly, then turned away without answering, displaying her emotions very well.
1:4:12|1:4:27|Liu Li gazed at Han Bing's departing figure for a long time, leaving only herself in the room, feeling lonely and desolate. The scene shifted, and [Yang Hui], a hunting maid, almost fell to the ground. At this moment, she was practicing, but due to the wound, she couldn't even walk normally.
1:4:27|1:4:34|Sitting alone at home, [Liu Li] is surrounded by her own model posters. Even though she looks glamorous on the posters, she can't bring herself to be happy.
1:4:37|1:4:55|[Yang Hui] tried her best to find a suitable fulcrum, using her injured leg to test, but each attempt almost made her fall. Every time she lifted her leg, her balance was unstable. The intense and unbearable pain made her look fierce and fragile. She tried to throw punches as before, imagining the opponent right in front of her, but to no avail.
1:4:55|1:5:5|Nostalgic for the past, [Liu Li] tried to call [Yang Hui], but couldn't get through. Feeling dejected, [Liu Li] tossed the phone aside and lay alone among the pile of posters.
1:5:7|1:5:24|Childhood memories flashed through his mind. [Yang Hui]'s mother walked down the steps, while [Yang Hui] and [Liu Li] were playing happily.
1:5:31|1:5:43|[Liu Li] and [Yang Hui] were chasing each other, running across the narrow stone steps. In order to prevent [Yang Hui] from getting the egg, [Liu Li] did a handstand directly, sticking tightly to the wall. [Yang Hui] panted heavily and sat down on the ground.
1:5:48|1:5:58|Yang Hui glanced at [Liu Li], then picked up her arrow and tapped it three times, looking it up and down with a disdainful expression. She then threw it on the ground and walked away.
1:6:4|1:6:18|Thoughts returned to reality, with a frozen land in front of her, a vast expanse of white at the boundary of heaven and earth. Speeding down the wide and endless road is a white sedan, with [Liu Li] sitting in the driver's seat. At this moment, she is driving hurriedly towards the training ground.
1:6:18|1:6:31|On the other side, Yang Hui is running in the snow, wearing a thick down jacket, each step looking very heavy and conspicuous in the snow. [Liu Li] drives into the parking lot, turning the steering wheel skillfully, then stops the car.
1:6:32|1:6:44|He wore a pair of sunglasses, a high-end scarf, jeans, and leather boots, looking very capable. [Liu Li] got off the car and strode towards the snowy field, with only his figure in the vast land.
1:6:44|1:7:2|As they crossed over the hill, Yang Hui continued to sprint forward, her long ponytail swaying back and forth, with no clear destination in sight. In contrast, [Liu Li] was much more composed, only when [Liu Li] reached the center of the hill did she see Yang Hui running in the snow. After a moment of contemplation, she lowered her head.
1:7:4|1:7:20|Liu Li didn't call out to [Yang Hui], but stood still, gazing firmly into the distance. The land was covered in silver white, pure and clean, with thick ice making the cold bone-chilling. At this moment, [Yang Hui] was a bit tired, she stopped in her tracks, panting heavily.
1:7:20|1:7:27|Turning around, she locked eyes with [Liu Li], and childhood memories flashed through her mind like a revolving lantern once again.
1:7:30|1:7:47|Remember when they were playing together with their friends as kids, it was a snowy winter day. [Yang Hui] was carrying a basket of eggs, slipped accidentally while chasing around, and the eggs broke on the ground. Other friends picked up the eggs from the ground and started throwing them at each other, but only [Liu Li] bent down, patiently helping her pick up the eggs.
1:7:48|1:7:52|[Yang Hui]'s hand was severely scraped due to the fall, with blood covering it as soon as it was lifted.
1:8:3|1:8:12|No matter how hard Liu Li tried to hold on, all she got was the back view of [Yang Hui] walking away gracefully. Childhood memories kept flashing before her eyes.
1:8:15|1:8:35|The scene shifts, and Han Bing appears in Grandpa Liu Li's house. Han Bing stands at the door for a while, observing the old-fashioned interior. She pushes the door open, still with her hands in her pockets. Han Bing walks into the room, where Liu Li's grandfather is practicing calligraphy. Han Bing takes a few steps forward.
1:8:44|1:8:58|Han Bing pondered for a moment, his eyes wandering over the furnishings and calligraphy on the bookshelf, then walked slowly to the side of [Liu Li] grandfather. [Liu Li] grandfather put down the brush in his hand, waiting for him to speak. Han Bing picked up the Go board on the table and started playing while talking.
1:9:14|1:9:31|Han Bing's eyes were calm like a still ancient well, and Grandpa Liu Li said this sentence before walking away. They were members of the geological team, and encountered an avalanche in Shangri-La during a survey of the snow mountain. Liu Li was only five years old when they left, Liu Li.
1:9:47|1:10:2|The scene shifts to the runway where models are strutting their stuff. The dazzling stage lights cast a floral pattern on the ground. The models, dressed in extravagant gowns, showcase themselves in the center of the stage. Liu Li's face, with distinct features, appears even more enchanting under the bright lights.
1:10:43|1:10:57|Outside, it was pouring rain, and [Liu Li] didn't even have an umbrella as she hurried towards the company. Finally, she stopped in her tracks and saw her grandfather wearing a raincoat, with a few raindrops hanging on his white beard. He held an umbrella in his hand, but it wasn't open, standing alone in the rain.
1:10:57|1:11:2|[Liu Li] quickly followed her grandfather when she saw him, without any of the arrogance and domineering attitude she displayed on stage.
1:11:18|1:11:28|Liu Li's cheeks were marked with two clear tear streaks as she trembled to respond. Sitting cross-legged in front of her grandfather, she trembled and called out "Grandpa," recalling the teachings her grandfather had given her and Yang Hui back then.
1:11:54|1:11:57|[Liu Li] looked determined in her eyes as she raised her head and spoke.
1:12:29|1:12:45|Grandpa hurried away. Time has passed, [Liu Li] stood on the ice rink where she used to practice martial arts, surrounded by a group of children holding swords and practicing with each other. At that moment, Yang Hui walked towards [Liu Li] with a limp in the cold winter wind. [Liu Li] turned her back, unwilling to face her.
1:12:59|1:13:10|Liu Li was unable to argue back, as if the world had suddenly gone silent. Yang Hui walked up behind him and let out a loud roar.
1:13:14|1:13:33|Yang Hui suddenly rushed to Liu Li, snatched the sword and luggage from her hands. Due to the vast difference in size, Liu Li was pushed to the ground during the struggle. Yang Hui took Liu Li's luggage and left, leaving Liu Li standing alone in a daze. The collar of Liu Li's coat was blown open by the cold wind, with a few pieces of partially melted snow still sticking to her body.
1:13:33|1:13:38|She stood still in place, and a little boy walked up to her, about the same age as Liu Li back then.
1:13:42|1:13:46|At this moment, Yang Hui is walking towards Grandpa Liu Li's tombstone.
1:14:49|1:14:52|[Liu Li] was pushed to the ground, his bangs scattered casually in front of his eyes.
1:15:1|1:15:23|The expression on Liu Li's face was very painful as she helped Yang Hui up, her body trembling slightly. She rested Yang Hui's head on her chest and comforted her softly. The two leaned against each other, with Liu Li gently stroking Yang Hui's head. Coming home late, Yang Hui might have caught a cold, shivering all over and running a high fever. Liu Li prepared a towel.
1:15:26|1:15:39|[Yang Hui] was pale and could hardly speak. After taking the towel, [Liu Li] took off her scarf and put it on [Yang Hui], holding her hands tightly together. [Liu Li] looked at her with concern, and suddenly, [Yang Hui] grabbed [Liu Li].
1:15:42|1:15:45|[Yang Hui] looked desperate, with two tears streaming down her face.
1:15:49|1:15:57|His gaze shifted to [Liu Li], as if there was something unsaid. [Liu Li] looked back with a determined gaze mixed with tears.
1:16:0|1:16:5|[Liu Li] turned her head, paused, and what she said next was even more unexpected.
1:16:14|1:16:30|Yang Hui couldn't hold back anymore when she heard this, tightly holding Liu Li's hand and not letting go, starting to sob. Liu Li placed her hand against Yang Hui's ear, the two of them clinging closely to each other. The next day, Liu Li really did push Yang Hui to this training ground that she was once so familiar with.
1:16:30|1:16:37|The other students were younger, just like he used to be. At this moment, Han Bing stood on the training ground, watching them train.
1:16:38|1:16:58|In a series of shouts, that familiar yet unfamiliar feeling surged up. [Liu Li] slowly approached, and Han Bing happened to turn around, seeing the figures of [Liu Li] and Yang Hui. There was no hint of surprise or astonishment in her expression, as if it was expected. However, she immediately turned back, pretending not to have seen them, and continued training.
1:16:58|1:17:7|Liu Li stood behind her, ran to the stage and stared straight at her back. Han Bing seemed to still be focused on training the students, so [Liu Li] slowed down.
1:17:10|1:17:25|Han Bing turned around and looked back, expressionless and indifferent. Yang Hui sat alone in a wheelchair, watching Han Bing and [Liu Li] talking not far away. Then, Han Bing walked up to [Liu Li] and circled around, looking her up and down.
1:17:25|1:17:39|[Liu Li] responded with a determined expression, but still appeared nonchalant and evenly matched. Han Bing's question left [Liu Li] speechless and embarrassed. She avoided Han Bing's words, her eyes cast down.
1:18:28|1:18:45|The scene shifts to the training ground, where Yang Hui is sitting in a wheelchair, while [Liu Li] is shouting instructions, conducting physical recovery training. [Liu Li] has a pair of free weights on her head, one on each side. She exerts all her strength to lift the weights for the final time, then moves on to another training exercise.
1:18:46|1:19:1|[Liu Li] holds the dumbbell plate and rapidly rotates her body from side to side, sweating profusely with the power of her core and abdomen. Then she ties bandages around her feet and runs to the other side of the training ground to start kicking training. Yang Hui is swiftly following behind her.
1:19:16|1:19:21|[Liu Li] exhaustedly tried to stand up, but due to unstable balance, almost fell down.
1:19:24|1:19:34|[Liu Li] threw the dumbbell away, panting heavily, and the dumbbell rolled freely on the ground due to inertia. The next day, Han Bing led her and the students to train together.
1:19:41|1:19:52|1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The students marched in unison, with Han Bing at the center, forming a circle. [Liu Li] was among them, with a headband on her head. As they passed by Han Bing, the two exchanged a glance, but remained silent.
1:19:52|1:19:57|Finally, Han Bing walked to the corner, holding a list in his hand, and called Liu Li over.
1:20:7|1:20:30|[Liu Li], a diligent and righteous worker, was about to leave when he turned back and said a few words. Suddenly, I felt guilty towards Han Bin. For the arrival of this day, he had no idea how much effort he had put in and endured far more pressure than us. When he trained with us day in and day out with a disabled body.
1:20:42|1:20:51|On the day of the Olympic Games opening ceremony, the ten thousand flying warriors arrived in the blink of an eye. The glorious moment finally arrived, stirring the hearts of 1.3 billion men, women, and children.
1:20:51|1:21:8|The grand opening ceremony is underway, with birds in the stadium cheering and chirping. Representatives from various countries first arrived on horseback to deliver the five-ring tickets, and under various lights, the magnificent and spectacular Bird's Nest appeared particularly dazzling and magnificent.
1:21:8|1:21:24|Athletes are officially entering the arena, with bands playing classic music from different continents to showcase the styles of the five major continents. A young girl is performing aerial ballet, while the entering athletes are full of vitality and spirit, smiling and waving to the audience from time to time.
1:21:24|1:21:28|And the audience on site welcomed their arrival with enthusiastic applause and cheers.
1:21:29|1:21:43|In the sound of qin and se, envoys from different countries traveled north through the night sky and performed various opening shows at the Bird's Nest. The lights shone on them, eventually forming the shape of a peace dove, symbolizing world peace.
1:21:43|1:21:58|At the moment when the Olympic flame was lit, a huge torch suddenly burst into flames, and the blazing Olympic flame illuminated the sky above the stadium, creating a brilliant scene. The dazzling fireworks rose synchronously, reflecting a blue rainbow in the sky above the stadium.
1:21:59|1:22:7|The lively music, enthusiastic cheers deafening, the atmosphere on site reaching its climax, and [Liu Li] will not give up the last moment's opportunity.
1:22:34|1:22:51|Liu Li stood directly opposite [Liu Li], like in a formal competition, the two of them stood facing each other in a bow to show respect. Liu Li first walked to the center of the training ground, stood still, and then performed a somersault in the air, but unexpectedly was stopped by Han Bing, who told her not to make any moves.
1:22:51|1:22:56|Shortly after, [Liu Li] imagined the opponent's appearance in the air, pushing off the ground with his right foot and rotating his hip joint to the left.
1:22:57|1:23:16|Subsequently, clenching both fists tightly by the sides of the body, using the left foot as the axis, lifting the right heel off the ground, pushing the foot against the ground, quickly raising the knee forward, arching the foot back, and forcefully springing forward. Then, switching legs and punching in the air, rotating the body 180 degrees backward, occasionally shouting, with both power and speed in sync.
1:23:16|1:23:32|In this scene, Han Bing watched everything. He crossed his arms and watched as [Liu Li] threw punches repeatedly. The two figures, one tall and one short, were cast on the ground by the streetlights. After the training session, Han Bing helped [Liu Li] relax his muscles. At this moment, [Liu Li] was only covered by a towel, quietly lying on the massage table.
1:23:32|1:23:47|Han Bing applied oil to her hands, rubbed them together to warm up, and then pressed them firmly against her skin. Starting from [Liu Li]'s neck, she rubbed downwards with force until reaching the jawline, then shifted the pressure to the arms. [Liu Li] didn't seem to enjoy it like others, but rather appeared somewhat anxious and uneasy.
1:23:48|1:24:5|Han Bing pressed for quite a while, and [Liu Li] gradually entered a good state, but it was not difficult to see that she had something on her mind. [Liu Li] turned her head to the side, arms outstretched. Han Bing lifted [Liu Li]'s calf, gently squeezed and relaxed it, then lifted and stretched it again. However, [Liu Li] did not feel relaxed at all, but instead stared blankly at a certain spot.
1:24:5|1:24:10|Upon returning to the hotel they were staying at, Yang Hui was helping [Liu Li] comb her hair. Seeing that Liu Li seemed distracted, she spoke up and asked.
1:24:23|1:24:28|Yang Hui nodded in agreement, playing with the comb in her hand.
1:24:42|1:24:53|Shortly after, [Liu Li] lay on Yang Hui's arms, seeming to relax a lot. She gazed at the ceiling absentmindedly, with a slight smile on her lips, and her handsome cheeks appeared somewhat thinner.
1:24:53|1:25:1|On the day of the finals, led by the representative of the Chinese team, [Liu Li], Yang Hui, and Han Bing entered the venue, causing a stir in the crowd. The commentator on the side began to give a brief introduction of [Liu Li].
1:25:13|1:25:23|His opponent is the famous Russian player, Rice. He has won the European championship and the world championship several times.
1:25:35|1:25:40|Chinese athlete [Liu Li], known for her fast movements and fierce attacks.
1:25:41|1:25:58|[Liu Li] has won the championship of this year's World Taekwondo Championships and has also achieved the best results in many world competitions. [Rice] is a very strong player, rumored to be of European and American descent.
1:26:5|1:26:12|The match begins, with [Liu Li] and [Rice] facing each other. [Liu Li] starts off by kicking, shifting her weight slightly backward.
1:26:12|1:26:22|[Rice] thought he had an opportunity and started to kick towards [Liu Li], but [Liu Li] swiftly dodged [Rice]'s attack with a back step, followed by a quick roundhouse kick to the back of [Rice].
1:26:23|1:26:33|[Rice] hit the ground heavily and went out of bounds. In order to counterattack, [Rice] subtly shifted his weight back, which was more advantageous for the counterattack. This move deceived [Liu Li].
1:26:33|1:26:42|When Liu Li was about to kick, Lai Si stumbled and kicked, causing Liu Li to fall to the ground. Both of them kept making sounds to cheer themselves up.
1:26:43|1:26:48|Han Bing was even more excited when he saw this, directing [Liu Li] to use her head directly from the sidelines.
1:26:50|1:26:58|Liu Li's sense of crisis is rising, her explosive power is stronger than Blue Silk, so she is more adept at using explosive power to launch attacks quickly and accurately.
1:26:58|1:27:13|But Liu Li, on the contrary, his strategy is often to wear down the opponent's stamina. As long as Liu Li doesn't focus on the center, he can deceive the opponent without exposing any flaws, such as showing a counterattack stance, suddenly stealing a move, launching a surprise attack, catching the opponent off guard.
1:27:13|1:27:28|From the front court match, it is clear that Lai Si has the upper hand, with Liu Li being blocked several times. The audience is more excited, as the strength of these two players is evenly matched. Just as Liu Li stands up again, it seems like a magnetic field from Xiangxi has formed between him and Lai Si.
1:27:28|1:27:43|Once the two are in the same plane, even with the referee trying to intervene in the middle, they cannot stop the confrontation between the two Taekwondo masters. With a momentum to fight as soon as they meet, [Liu Li] is once again kicked to the ground, followed by a back kick from Lais, then his right foot quickly retracts along the line of force.
1:27:43|1:28:0|Liu Li not only was kicked to the ground, but her left arm also violently collided with the ground. Han Bing and Yang Hui were anxiously stomping their feet in the audience. Despite being knocked down time and time again, Liu Li continued the rhythm of falling and getting up, until Les once again attacked her injured arm, causing a sharp pain.
1:28:0|1:28:8|[Liu Li] lay on the ground unable to get up, hiding his arms in his chest and abdomen, a sensation that cut into his bone marrow swept through his body, causing [Liu Li] to roll frantically on the ground.
1:28:31|1:28:39|With a scream from [Liu Li], her mind was brought back to reality, realizing how ruthless Han Bing was at that moment, and how passionate the atmosphere was at the competition venue.
1:29:48|1:30:4|After a moment of inner struggle, [Liu Li] felt numbness in his left hand due to the pain. He tightly bound his left hand with his right hand, raised it towards the sky, and let out a sorrowful cry, as if bidding farewell to himself. Even his opponent, Les, couldn't figure out his condition, and the referee was cheering him on from the sidelines.
1:30:5|1:30:24|Han Bing looked worried on the sidelines, while [Liu Li] clenched his fists and fiercely swung at Han Bing from a distance. Taking advantage of the opponent's unpreparedness, he delivered several hard kicks, originally just hitting the body, but now directly targeting the head. [Liu Li]'s helmet was already soaked with sweat, and with this kick, the sweat flew out directly, leaving his head in a daze.
1:30:24|1:30:27|Until [Liu Li] realized that she was being attacked with one kick after another.
1:30:28|1:30:40|[Liu Li] just realized that the audience below saw this scene, and their emotions were even more intense. Some of the audience even cheered and applauded for [Liu Li], hoping that [Liu Li] could counterattack fiercely.
1:30:40|1:30:49|At this moment, [Liu Li]'s expression became more ferocious, his pupils dilated, staring fiercely at his opponent. In a trance, he recalled his grandfather's words in his mind.
1:30:56|1:31:11|The opponent was still unaware of what [Liu Li] was about to do, feeling a bit relaxed. However, with shouts ringing out, [Liu Li] pinched his arm towards the chest protector, recovered the momentum, kicked wildly, leaped up, and with a final kick, Les was defeated.
1:31:12|1:31:25|The referee quickly ran to the side of Lai Si, counting down to the entire audience, but unfortunately Lai Si struggled to get up. Then, the referee made a gesture of failure, and [Liu Li], due to excessive excitement, unstable balance, and exhaustion, directly knelt down on the ring.
1:31:25|1:31:32|Waving her right fist towards [Yang Hui] and [Han Bing] off the field, she took off her helmet, sweat and tears mingling together.
1:31:32|1:31:49|Still unable to distinguish between sweat and tears, [Liu Li] slowly regained her composure. Joy had clouded her mind, the smile on her face still covering her left arm, but she slowly stood up, deeply bowing to the audience. She had surpassed herself, screaming in excitement.
1:31:49|1:31:57|Shortly after, [Han Bing] and [Yang Hui] entered the scene, and [Liu Li] embraced them affectionately. The audience cheered for her, and [Liu Li] was overwhelmed with joy and tears.
1:31:58|1:32:12|At the end of the match, the master and disciples embraced tightly, with dazzling lights shining above the stadium, as if all were cheering for [Liu Li]. This time, [Liu Li] not only surpassed the enemy, but also surpassed himself.
1:32:12|1:32:17|He also pays tribute to the Olympic spirit, which is a spirit that will never be defeated by the enemy.
1:32:18|1:32:33|At the end of the film is a scene of [Liu Li] holding a gold medal, with the five-star red flag representing China in the background. Her face is filled with the vigor of youth, as well as the determination and steadfastness of an athlete.
