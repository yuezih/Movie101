0:1:57|0:2:0|Dong Xianzhou teaches the young [Dong Haichuan] martial arts step by step.
0:2:9|0:2:14|Now, his boxing skills are strong and powerful. At this moment, he is practicing martial arts in the courtyard.
0:2:18|0:2:30|Carrying a quiver on his back and holding a bow and arrow in his hand, [Ma Dongmei] walked out of the house with a wide stride, approaching him who was practicing martial arts with a smile.
0:2:56|0:3:5|With his father Dong Xianzhou's permission, Dong Ying happily pulled [Dong Haichuan] towards the forest and successfully shot a wild rabbit.
0:3:15|0:3:28|A wealthy young master rode a horse to the woods, followed by many servants. At this moment, one of the servants spotted a girl picking mushrooms.
0:3:30|0:3:37|Upon seeing the teenage girl, the wealthy young master, along with his servant, quietly approached the girl.
0:4:0|0:4:8|The girl exerted all her strength and landed a solid slap on the face of the wealthy young master.
0:4:22|0:4:39|During the struggle, the girl's clothes were torn apart, revealing her tight-fitting underwear. [Dong Haichuan] and the other person heard the cry for help and quickly ran towards the sound.
0:4:44|0:4:55|Only [Dong Haichuan] was seen sweeping with a stick, and several servants fell to the ground. The rich young master, seeing this, released the girl and gritted his teeth as he watched this troublemaker.
0:5:0|0:5:15|The wealthy young master took the sword from [Butler Luo], walked towards [Dong Haichuan] who was fighting, before he could get close, everyone accompanying him fell to the ground and couldn't get up. The wealthy young master tried to frame [Butler Luo], but was immediately knocked down by [Dong Haichuan].
0:5:44|0:5:50|[Hu Gongzi] swung his sword, [Dong Haichuan] reacted quickly and then used a stick to push him away with a strike and a poke.
0:6:35|0:6:46|Led by the girl, [Dong Haichuan] and Dong Ying arrived at the grass hut deep in the jungle, where an old man was practicing Tai Chi with a horse stance in the courtyard.
0:6:47|0:7:4|[Dong Haichuan] watched the old man's every move with fascination. The old man's movements were smooth and flowing, like a fox catching a rabbit, and his spirit was sharp like a cat catching a mouse. After absorbing the energy into his lower abdomen, he relaxed his whole body, slowly bent his knees, and turned to look at his granddaughter standing at the door.
0:8:29|0:8:44|[Butler Luo] led several servants to search for [Dong Haichuan]'s whereabouts. It started to rain heavily outside. At that moment, [Dong Haichuan] and two others were carrying a wild rabbit they had hunted, planning to sell it to a tavern. Coincidentally, this scene was witnessed by the passing [Butler Luo].
0:8:44|0:8:50|He carefully identified him and, after confirming it was [Dong Haichuan], hurriedly ran back to the mansion.
0:10:28|0:10:37|[Butler Luo]'s words temporarily calmed [Mr. Hu]'s mood. In the peaceful life, [Xuelian] embroidered a handkerchief with flowers for [Dong Haichuan].
0:10:48|0:10:52|[Xuelian] avoided the intense gaze of [Dong Haichuan] and smiled awkwardly.
0:11:25|0:11:41|The simple conversation between the master and disciple at night not only resolved the long-standing concerns of the master, but also brought [Dong Haichuan] and [Xuelian] closer together. One morning, [Dong Haichuan] held [Xuelian]'s hand and arrived at a waterfall in the deep forest.
0:11:41|0:11:48|The two people admired the majestic waterfall, gazing affectionately at each other, gradually leaning towards each other.
0:11:48|0:12:6|[Xuelian] leaned shyly against [Dong Haichuan]'s chest, and at that moment, [Dong Haichuan] felt like he had the whole world. He was already deeply in love with [Xuelian]. They played and frolicked together by the mountain stream, filled with happiness and laughter.
0:12:6|0:12:19|Nestled in the valley, the only thing in the eyes of the two people is each other. As time passes day by day, [Dong Haichuan] practices Tai Chi diligently with his master, while sweetly spending time with [Xuelian].
0:12:19|0:12:28|One night, Master had another conversation with [Dong Haichuan] in the courtyard, walking and talking. [Dong Haichuan] followed behind him.
0:14:57|0:15:5|Inside the house, [Xuelian] saw this scene, feeling particularly conflicted.
0:15:26|0:15:47|The butler brought back three martial arts masters from the capital to the courtyard, who then demonstrated their martial arts skills one by one. The first to perform was the Flying Knife God [Li Jie], who did several backflips in a row, then threw several short daggers from the sheath on his thigh, firmly embedding them into the trees in the courtyard.
0:15:47|0:16:6|Madam Wu nodded approvingly when she saw it. Following that, the Meteor Strange Hero Yun Ye displayed his unique skill, swinging an iron whip at a tree stump, instantly creating a large hole. Then, Dong Haichuan, wielding his own unique weapon, ...
0:16:6|0:16:14|After spinning rapidly, the table used for the ritual in the courtyard was chopped in half.
0:16:21|0:16:36|[Mrs. Hu] and her son exchanged a satisfied smile. Inside the martial arts school, [Dong Haichuan] continued to train diligently every day. The habit he had since childhood was deeply ingrained in his bones, and beads of sweat covered his forehead, with veins bulging.
0:16:36|0:16:51|The next day, many people came to the Mingyang Martial Arts Hall, with major martial arts sects gathering together to learn from each other and improve their skills. The leaders of the major sects sat in the front row, and then the disciples of the Mingyang Martial Arts Hall began to demonstrate their martial arts.
0:16:57|0:17:15|The disciples' martial arts display made [Dong Haichuan] very pleased, a smile couldn't help but appear on his lips. Their steps were steady and firm, their punches strong and powerful, even the Grand Master of Southern Shaolin couldn't help but secretly admire. The disciples of former boxing champion Master Lin also refused to be outdone.
0:17:15|0:17:29|The character displayed fierce and swift claw-like movements, resembling a black tiger extracting its heart. The punches were intense and rapid, followed by lifting the left leg with the foot straight like a standing golden rooster. The disciples of the Shaolin Temple also showcased their martial arts skills.
0:17:29|0:17:45|In the courtyard, everything was observed by [Steward Luo] who was peeping from outside. He tugged at the beard on his chin, secretly calculating something in his mind. When the competition ended, [Dong Haichuan] and several fellow disciples came to the restaurant to have a few drinks.
0:17:54|0:17:59|At this moment, [Master Hu] arrived at the restaurant with several martial arts experts from the capital city.
0:18:19|0:18:33|Who would have expected that three martial arts masters from the capital city have already flown to the second floor. The throwing knife god Li Jie took the lead, [Dong Haichuan] reacted quickly, dodging the dagger that came towards him, and quickly engaged in combat with the tablemate who was dining with the throwing knife god Li Jie.
0:18:33|0:18:48|The Meteor Knight Xiangyun also used the iron whip to swing towards [Dong Haichuan], but was avoided by [Dong Haichuan] and hit the dining table. Seizing the opportunity, [Dong Haichuan] stepped on his iron whip, then grabbed the whip and wrapped it around his neck.
0:18:50|0:18:56|[Dong Haichuan] immediately understood when he saw [Master Hu].
0:19:7|0:19:31|[Dong Haichuan] pushed the popular weird hero onto the table. The innkeeper sensed trouble and quickly had the waiter inform [Dong Xianzhou]. [Dong Haichuan] and his two senior brothers were now using their well-practiced kung fu skills to confront the servant wielding a long sword.
0:19:31|0:19:55|In no time, the servants fell to the ground one after another. Another group of servants with long swords rushed forward. [Dong Haichuan] fought bare-handed, striking fiercely and swiftly at the oncoming attackers. He kicked one servant into the air and continued to pummel the others. Midway through the fight, he noticed [Master Hu] sitting on the side, preparing to drink tea, and a plan formed in his mind.
0:19:58|0:20:15|Before it could be delivered to his mouth, the full cup of tea spilled on [Mr. Hu]'s face. [Mr. Hu] protected his head but not his stomach, and took a solid punch from [Dong Haichuan].
0:20:20|0:20:30|Seeing that Mingyang Martial Arts School brought a group of disciples, the steward advised [Mr. Hu] to retreat. Shortly after, the servants supported each other and left.
0:21:57|0:22:16|Returning to the room, [Dong Haichuan] held the handkerchief embroidered by [Xuelian] and gently stroked the embroidery on it, a gentle smile appearing on his lips. Suddenly, a group of black-clothed men appeared outside the door, each wearing night clothes, but it was still recognizable that they were the men brought by [Mr. Hu].
0:22:16|0:22:35|They split up, with one group of people waiting on the roof, while another group flipped over the fence into the courtyard. The movements were agile and nimble, with the steward and three martial arts experts waiting outside the fence. Inside the courtyard, people held long swords, gently pushed open the door, and quietly walked towards the house.
0:22:35|0:23:0|After a moment, there was a strange noise in the room, and one by one, the people in night clothes screamed in horror. Then, [Master Dong Haichuan] and [Xuelian] walked out of the room, seeing their subordinates lying on the ground. [Mr. Hu] dismounted and walked into the courtyard.
0:23:1|0:23:22|Grandpa gestured for [Xuelian] to enter the house to take cover. Immediately after, a person in night clothes brandished a knife and approached. [Xuelian] pressed close to the door, keeping an eye on everything happening in the courtyard. Grandpa acted swiftly and decisively, knocking down one person with a skillful palm strike, and then calmly dodging the swords of three skilled fighters from the capital.
0:23:22|0:23:26|The character [Ma Dongmei] is at a loss and takes a blow to the abdomen from the popular eccentric hero Xiang Yun.
0:23:35|0:23:55|She called out for her grandfather, [Master Hu] approached, and [Xuelian] tried to fight back, but was knocked unconscious from behind. A servant picked up the unconscious [Xuelian] and placed her on the back of [Master Hu]'s horse. Then the group left directly, leaving the grandfather in the courtyard in an unknown condition.
0:23:55|0:24:17|As the night fell, [Dong Haichuan] arrived at the small cabin in the mountains. Seeing no one answering, he walked closer and saw a mess in the courtyard. Anxiously, he walked into the courtyard and saw his master lying on the ground.
0:24:50|0:24:56|[Dong Haichuan] cried out holding his deceased master.
0:25:5|0:25:29|[Dong Haichuan] finally found the murderer who killed his master, tears filling his eyes. Seeing [Xuelian] on the horse, he became even more furious. He held his breath, clenched his fists silently, veins bulging on his face, and kicked towards [Master Hu] on the horse.
0:25:44|0:25:50|[Xuelian] gradually regained consciousness, and [Dong Haichuan] quickly launched an attack, engaging in a fierce battle with the person charging at him with a knife.
0:25:50|0:26:10|Seeing the expert from the capital appear again, [Xuelian] couldn't help but feel afraid, but [Dong Haichuan] was skilled enough to throw him several meters away, then he approached the shoulder of the mysterious swordsman Xingyun with a sword, and then slashed his neck.
0:26:11|0:26:37|[Dong Haichuan] pulled [Xuelian] and ran forward continuously, trying to escape from the clutches of [Mr. Hu]. However, things did not go as planned. They ran to a waterfall, with a deep abyss below. [Mr. Hu]'s men quickly caught up, and the two of them found themselves in a dilemma. With two fists against four hands, [Dong Haichuan] was also in a panic.
0:26:51|0:26:58|[Xuelian] couldn't help but grab [Dong Haichuan]'s arm. Upon seeing this, [Mr. Hu] and the others laughed unabashedly.
0:27:0|0:27:22|[Dong Haichuan] saw his beloved woman being mocked, anger once again filled his mind. He took up his sword and fought forward, killing several lackeys under [Master Hu], and then fought against the Eight Night Walkers led by Shan Pengfei. The Flying Knife God Li Jie sensed the danger and reached for the scabbard at his abdomen.
0:27:22|0:27:39|[Dong Haichuan] reacted quickly, dodging the dagger and stabbing a person next to him in the stomach. [Master Hu] couldn't help but feel scared, he urged the steward to catch [Xuelian] in an attempt to threaten [Dong Haichuan].
0:28:4|0:28:17|[Xuelian] took advantage of the butler's inattention, quietly reached behind her waist, quickly pulled out the dagger hidden in advance, stabbed the butler, and then turned the blade towards herself.
0:28:25|0:28:40|[Dong Haichuan] was firmly pressed to the ground by two servants. The two servants slowly released their grip. [Dong Haichuan] was half in doubt, but still slowly got up and embraced them.
0:28:41|0:28:56|The legendary assassin Li Jie strikes again, [Xuelian] blocks the flying blades for [Dong Haichuan], her body uncontrollably staggers back a few steps, [Dong Haichuan] quickly grabs her.
0:29:15|0:29:24|[Xuelian] gradually lost strength and let go of her hand.
0:29:42|0:29:48|Saying that, [Dong Haichuan] grabbed [Master Hu]'s collar and threw him towards the cliff behind him.
0:29:57|0:30:15|Below the cliff is a deep pool, and [Dong Haichuan] quickly regained consciousness after falling down. After swimming to the shallow water area, [Dong Haichuan] floundered for a few moments, then stood firmly in the water. Ignoring the pain in his body, he looked around, rotating his body in the water, searching for the figure of [Xuelian].
0:30:17|0:30:22|He kept calling out helplessly,
0:30:43|0:31:5|His loud voice echoed for a long time, resounding through the valley. He wished so much for a voice to respond to him, but there was none. Helplessly, he slapped the water surface. Suddenly, a stone by the pool caught his attention, and next to the stone lay a jade pendant. The owner of the jade pendant was none other than [Xuelian].
0:31:31|0:31:38|[Mrs. Hu Huihui] couldn't accept the fact that her son fell off the cliff, and in a fit of anger, she fainted.
0:32:0|0:32:20|[Dong Haichuan] returned from the cliff and buried his master in the ground, kowtowing three times in front of the master's grave. Besides [Dong Haichuan], there were also the abbot of Shaolin Temple, Master Du, and other martial artists. Everyone had a solemn expression, bowing and paying their respects to express their mourning.
0:32:20|0:32:37|[Ma Dongchuan] stood up after knocking his head, wiped away the tears from the corners of his eyes, and stared blankly at the tombstone. He let out a long sigh, not knowing what to do. His master was dead, and his beloved [Xuelian] was also missing, her fate unknown.
0:32:37|0:32:45|[Dong Xianzhou] looked at him in a daze, gently patting his shoulder, and then he came to his senses.
0:34:37|0:34:51|After the Master finished saying these words with disappointment, [Dong Haichuan] nodded and turned to him.
0:35:49|0:35:56|[Mr. Hu] is currently frolicking with a courtesan in the room, with smoke filling the air.
0:36:3|0:36:11|The woman pinched Mr. Hu's thigh hard, but Mr. Hu did not blame her.
0:36:27|0:36:41|[Mr. Hu] quickly drove away the two courtesans beside him, hid the big opium pipe and kerosene lamp on the table, then stood up to straighten his messy clothes. He waved his hand in the air a few times, trying to cover up the smell of opium in the air.
0:37:24|0:37:31|[Hu Daren], who has lost his beloved son, is now filled with hatred towards [Dong Haichuan].
0:38:31|0:38:43|Before leaving, Mr. Hu handed a large silver note to [Prince Xiao]. Upon seeing this, [Prince Xiao] set down the tea in his hand and a smile appeared on his face. On the other side, [Dong Haichuan],
0:38:43|0:38:59|Under the guidance of [Master Biyun], he diligently practiced day and night, focusing his mind during practice, with concentrated thoughts, swift offense and defense, versatile techniques, clear and powerful boxing skills, and explosive energy.
0:38:59|0:39:14|Between the expansion and contraction of his movements, there is a continuous flow. He remains calm and collected, attempting to perfect every action. His footwork complements his boxing, steady and methodical, proceeding with determination and perseverance.
0:39:14|0:39:37|Years have passed in the blink of an eye, and [Dong Haichuan] has matured from a young man to a skilled martial artist. His strength has become immense, his movements swift and powerful, and his punches are delivered with incredible force. Since childhood, he has practiced a variety of martial arts techniques, blending the essence of different styles.
0:39:37|0:40:3|His boxing skills are varied and dazzling, with extremely complex long movements combined with powerful palm strikes. Each move is closely connected, as if multiple arms are striking at the same time, appearing extremely fierce. The Shaolin Diamond Fist is practiced to perfection in his punches and kicks, and the completion of his master's wish to become a grandmaster is within reach.
0:40:3|0:40:10|One night, [Master Biyun] and [Dong Haichuan] were strolling around the temple. [Master Biyun] said to [Dong Haichuan].
0:41:25|0:41:33|[Dong Haichuan] carefully calculated the years.
0:42:13|0:42:32|Seeing the master insisting like this, there was nothing more to say. Reluctantly, she took one last look at the master and then walked down the mountain with her luggage on her back. [Dong Haichuan] also left the Shaolin Temple where he had been practicing for 10 years, carrying his luggage.
0:42:35|0:42:42|After coming down the mountain, he passed by a tavern on the street and walked in.
0:43:18|0:43:33|Hearing the cold sarcasm from [Dong Haichuan], [Princess Ziyun] swung her unsheathed sword towards him, but ultimately her skills were no match for him, and she was forced back by a palm strike from [Dong Haichuan].
0:43:38|0:44:0|After a simple meal, [Dong Haichuan] walked non-stop to a deep mountain where a Taoist temple was located. The stone lions at the entrance of the temple were covered with moss, and a young Taoist was sweeping the fallen leaves in front of the gate with a broom.
0:44:15|0:44:32|[Dong Haichuan] finished speaking, the young Taoist quickly made a move. Before he could get close, he was pushed several meters away by [Dong Haichuan] with a palm. [Dong Haichuan] walked towards the Taoist, but the young Taoist was still unwilling to give up. He stretched out his legs trying to stop him, but [Dong Haichuan] easily threw him several meters away again.
0:44:36|0:44:45|This finally made the young Taoist submit willingly.
0:44:58|0:45:11|At this moment, a woman suddenly rushed out from behind, [Dong Haichuan] exchanged a few simple moves with her. [Master Biyun] walked out from the audience.
0:45:43|0:46:4|[Master Biyun] soared into the air, leaped down from a tall building with one hand behind his back, swiftly striking out with his palm. [Dong Haichuan] struggled to resist, as [Master Biyun] changed his footwork and moved behind [Dong Haichuan], delivering a direct blow to his back.
0:46:24|0:46:30|[Princess Ziyun] came down the mountain and returned home.
0:50:10|0:50:29|The scene is quiet inside the temple, [Master Biyun] is practicing in the courtyard. He stands with his arms in a hugging-the-moon posture, forming a circle in front of his chest, his whole body squatting in a four-cornered non-sitting position, eyes closed to rest his spirit, motionless. It is evident that he has reached the state of unity of body and mind.
0:50:29|0:50:51|[Dong Haichuan] found [Master Biyun], and after watching his movements, he walked over and followed along. [Master Biyun] sensed the presence beside him, smiled knowingly, slowly raised his eyes. Seeing that the person beside him was indeed as he expected, he put down his hands in front of him and stood up.
0:51:3|0:51:12|In his dream, [Dong Haichuan] saw an old man with a white beard sitting cross-legged in the Bagua formation, focusing his breath and spirit.
0:51:44|0:52:11|Continuously recalling the moves of the Eight Trigram Palm in his mind, [Dong Haichuan] practiced repeatedly the next day without any slack. Unstoppable and naturally intelligent, he had already reached the pinnacle of skill, with astonishing palm strength that could split a stool in half with bare hands.
0:52:30|0:52:33|[Dong Haichuan] just watched her silently without responding.
0:53:19|0:53:30|At this moment, wails could be heard on the stone steps outside the Taoist temple. Led by [Princess Ziyun], the group led by [Dong Haichuan] had arrived, and he was wielding his sword, fighting against the oncoming attackers.
0:53:30|0:53:46|The person who approached [Dong Haichuan] couldn't get close to him at all. She immediately drew her sword and stabbed towards [Dong Haichuan]. Seeing this, [Dong Haichuan] used his own sword to block, causing [Ziyun] to retreat repeatedly. [Yuyan] rushed out from the audience.
0:54:32|0:54:41|[Princess Yuyan] followed [Fourth Prince] out of the Taoist temple.
0:54:47|0:54:55|[Taoist Biyun] gave a set of iron weapons to [Dong Haichuan].
0:55:48|0:56:7|[Master Bikong] finished explaining and turned to enter the temple. [Dong Haichuan] left the mountain, while [Princess Yuyan] and [Fourth Prince] rode their horses down the mountain. In the woods, a group of bandits were hiding, about ten of them, each holding a long knife, carefully watching the situation at the foot of the slope.
0:56:7|0:56:25|After the target appeared, more than 10 people swarmed down towards [Fourth Prince] and [Princess Yuyan]. [Princess Yuyan] was very alert, and she noticed the unusual sound as soon as it came out, but it was already too late. The bandits, numerous in number, quickly blocked their way.
0:56:25|0:56:45|The leader of the bandits walked to the front from behind his men, glanced at [Princess Yuyan] sitting on the horse, and arrogantly said to [Fourth Prince]. [Fourth Prince] ignored his unreasonable request. [Princess Yuyan] was at a loss for a moment, and the bandit simply reached out his hand to try to snatch it.
0:56:45|0:56:53|However, following closely behind, [Dong Haichuan] saw this scene and immediately dismounted, rushing forward to kick the bandit's hand away.
0:56:53|0:57:12|[Yuyan] immediately dismounted and began fighting the bandits with her sword, while [Dong Haichuan] knocked down several bandits barehanded, then kicked the bandit leader in the chest with precision. The bandit leader let out a cry of pain, and blood gushed from his mouth.
0:57:12|0:57:19|[Dong Haichuan] grabbed his collar and lifted him up from the ground, following [Fourth Prince] to the county town of Wen'an.
0:57:51|0:58:0|The scene was spotted by [Steward Luo], who often dines at the restaurant, as he carefully observed [Dong Haichuan] in the distance.
0:59:37|0:59:41|[Dong Haichuan] raised his glass, when suddenly the waiter from the restaurant came over to them.
0:59:55|1:0:0|The butler [Luo] not far away glanced at the rising [Dong Haichuan] with secret joy,
1:0:17|1:0:27|[Steward Luo] got up and left the restaurant, then arrived at the county magistrate's mansion.
1:0:47|1:0:56|The county magistrate took the official document from [Steward Luo] and carefully read it.
1:2:28|1:2:37|[Steward Luo] leaned in close to the county magistrate and whispered a few words in his ear.
1:3:46|1:3:57|[Dong Haichuan] pressed down the leader of the bandits and, accompanied by several bailiffs, arrived at the prison cell.
1:5:10|1:5:34|[Fourth Prince] ignored it and turned his head to think of a solution, while [Dong Haichuan] was already in prison clothes and escorted to the court. The county magistrate put away his folding fan, knocked on the wooden block for attention, and picked up the official documents from the Ministry of Justice.
1:5:52|1:6:5|The magistrate dropped the command arrow in his hand, signaling the executioner to start the execution. The executioner dropped the death warrant behind [Ma Dongmei]. After seeing this scene, [Mr. Luo] knew that the scheme had succeeded, and he left the execution ground with a smile on his face.
1:6:5|1:6:19|The executioner handed a bowl of wine to [Dong Haichuan], but he disdainfully turned his head away. Seeing this, the executioner put down the bowl, picked up the knife, and gestured twice on his neck. [Dong Haichuan] closed his eyes, raised his head, and waited for death to come.
1:6:20|1:6:24|Upon hearing these three words, the county magistrate immediately stood up and knelt down with a sweep of his sleeves.
1:6:30|1:6:38|[Fourth Prince] arrived at the execution ground holding the imperial decree given to him by the emperor, followed closely by several imperial guards with swords.
1:7:17|1:7:34|In a street corner, a street performer is swinging his fists, surrounded by a crowd of onlookers. His punches are powerful, his moves are swift and unpredictable, and soon he wins applause from the spectators. A Chinese man with his queue cut off says to the foreigner next to him.
1:7:37|1:7:41|The two walked towards the direction of the sound and saw a person showing off his martial arts skills.
1:7:51|1:7:58|The person who cut off the braids rudely pushed aside the onlookers in front of him, leaving a gap. He asked the foreigner to step into the circle. The foreigner walked forward and grabbed the man's arm.
1:8:24|1:8:41|The foreigner and the street performer locked eyes for a moment, then the foreigner made the first move. He swung his left leg out tentatively, followed by his right leg, flipping his body in the air a few times before landing a kick on the street performer's chest. The street performer was unable to defend himself and fell into the crowd.
1:8:54|1:9:6|The foreigner overstepped his bounds, reaching out to harass [Ziyun], but was slapped by [Ziyun]. This completely angered the foreigner, and just then, [Dong Haichuan] appeared out of nowhere and pushed the foreigner back with a palm strike.
1:9:6|1:9:14|After the foreigner regained consciousness, he lifted his leg and kicked towards [Dong Haichuan]. But [Dong Haichuan] quickly grabbed his leg and the foreigner fell backwards onto the ground.
1:10:48|1:11:20|[Sha Huihui] has not received a response to the martial arts challenge. The people on the field look at each other, and after a while, finally someone steps forward. However, before getting close, he is kicked down by [Sha Huihui]. The man jumps up with his toes pointed, but [Sha Huihui] kicks him down with a turn.
1:11:20|1:11:29|On the field, anyone who is dissatisfied is knocked down by [Sha Huihui], and no one dares to step forward to challenge him.
1:11:44|1:11:59|Upon receiving orders from [Fourth Prince], [Dong Haichuan] stood up from his seat. Although his demeanor was sharp, it revealed an unsettling edge. [Sha Huihui] paid him no attention, glaring at him fiercely.
1:11:59|1:12:13|Two people stood back to back, looking at each other, the tension was palpable even though it hadn't officially started. After a few rounds of eye contact battle, [Sha Huihui] couldn't hold back any longer and began to speak first.
1:12:14|1:12:29|After speaking, he suddenly twisted his waist to the right, arms slightly open, officially challenging [Dong Haichuan]. [Dong Haichuan] smiled slightly at the corner of his mouth, as [Sha Huihui] rushed forward and executed a sweeping leg technique. [Dong Haichuan] quickly bent over and dodged.
1:12:29|1:12:45|[Sha Huihui] advances step by step, soaring into the air and spinning several times at high speed, kicking towards [Dong Haichuan]. [Dong Haichuan] grunts as he takes a kick, then decides to launch a counterattack. He withdraws his left foot, spins with his right, blocks with his right arm, strikes with his left arm, and quickly lowers his chassis while his right arm swiftly passes by.
1:12:45|1:12:56|[Sha Huihui] saw the situation turning unfavorable, constantly evading, using both hands and feet to climb up the high wall inside the hall like a gecko, but still with a face full of killing intent, eyes sharp as a blade.
1:12:56|1:13:7|Staring angrily at [Dong Haichuan], then gathering strength, releasing the hands grabbing the wall, bending down and rushing down, approaching the below [Dong Haichuan]. [Dong Haichuan] slightly sidestepped.
1:13:7|1:13:22|Avoiding the punches from [Sha Huihui], [Sha Huihui] becomes even more furious. The punches become more intense, but after flipping over, [Dong Haichuan] creates distance between them and both extend their palms. Full of anger, they both strike with full force again.
1:13:22|1:13:39|[Dong Haichuan] faced the enemy head-on, flipping his palm out, raising his arm to block, turning with a wrong step, then left to meet and right to block, changing his moves to dodge a strike. However, [Sha Huihui] was extremely cunning and domineering, pressing on with every punch. [Dong Haichuan] stopped his footsteps, seized the opportunity, and delivered a heavy blow to his waist.
1:13:41|1:13:46|The lady watching on the side couldn't help but sigh at this palm strike, as [Dong Haichuan] stood up and withdrew his momentum.
1:13:47|1:13:51|Sha Huizheng remained silent, clutching his waist in pain as he glared at [Dong Haichuan].
1:14:1|1:14:9|Seeing that [Prince Xiao] looked uneasy, [Prince Four] quickly asked.
1:14:56|1:15:3|The eyes of [Fourth Prince] lit up instantly.
1:15:8|1:15:16|[Prince Xiao] stood up and walked towards [Dong Haichuan].
1:16:15|1:16:29|Sha Huizheng saw [Prince Xiao] treating himself like this, snorted coldly, and left with his wife. [Princess Ziyun] also pouted, very puzzled by her father's actions.
1:18:20|1:18:34|Late at night, in the [Xiao Wang Mansion], [Dong Haichuan] who had nothing to do, remembered his former lover. Holding the jade pendant of [Xuelian] in his hand, he felt a wave of bitterness in his heart. Thinking about everything that happened that day under the cliff, he was filled with self-blame and regret.
1:18:35|1:18:51|He paced slowly under the pavilion late at night, and after a moment, sat on the stone bench with a worried look on his face. [Princess Ziyun] happened to pass by and saw [Dong Haichuan] in the pavilion, unmoving and staring at the object in his hand, so she walked slowly towards [Dong Haichuan].
1:19:8|1:19:14|[Dong Haichuan] still ignored her, still examining the jade pendant in his hand.
1:19:22|1:19:29|[Princess Ziyun] awkwardly took back her jade pendant.
1:19:48|1:19:55|The brief conversation between the two ends. The next morning, [Sha Huihui], who suffered a loss, was practicing martial arts in the courtyard.
1:19:56|1:20:15|He held the red tassel spear in his hand, with his left hand in front and his right hand behind. He exerted force with both hands to flip and retreat, drawing an arc from below to the upper right side, and stably and powerfully stabbed forward. His waist, legs, wrists, arms, and the long tassel spear were integrated, and the force penetrated through the cavity, resembling a swimming dragon.
1:20:15|1:20:25|[Dong Haichuan] saw [Sha Huihui] practicing martial arts and quickly bowed with clasped hands in respect.
1:20:50|1:21:3|[Dong Haichuan] did not respond, turned and left. [Sha Huihui] eyes were full of unwillingness.
1:21:16|1:21:25|Since losing the last martial arts competition, [Sha Huihui] has been feeling aggrieved, and today, with [Dong Haichuan]'s appearance, the fire inside him is ignited once again.
1:21:25|1:21:47|One midnight, [Dong Haichuan] was studying martial arts in the room. He held a book in one hand and gestured the moves in the book in the air with the other hand. Suddenly, a sharp sword flew towards him through the window. After dodging it, he quickly chased out and intercepted two people in night clothes.
1:21:47|1:22:1|The two ignored [Dong Haichuan] and rushed up to attack swiftly. [Dong Haichuan] quickly unveiled them, but to his surprise, the two were none other than [Sha Huihui] and his wife.
1:22:2|1:22:10|[Dong Haichuan] gave the two of them a cold look, then turned and walked away. He never mentioned what happened that night to anyone ever again.
1:23:29|1:23:33|The nun glanced at [Princess Ziyun], stood up and looked outside the door.
1:23:55|1:24:12|After Master finished speaking, she turned and left, leaving behind a puzzled [Ziyun], but she still followed Master's instructions. The next day, she brought [Dong Haichuan] to Xishan.
1:24:34|1:24:52|The nun walked forward, unexpectedly turned around and attacked [Dong Haichuan] with a whisk in hand. [Dong Haichuan] quickly reacted and countered. The nun pressed on step by step, but at this moment, [Daoist Biyun] suddenly appeared.
1:25:24|1:25:42|[Master Biyun] extended a hand, gesturing for [Dong Haichuan] to step aside, then squatted down with a bow stance and prepared to strike with his palm. [Master Bikong] also quickly made a move, forcefully swinging the floating dust in her hand towards [Master Biyun]. [Master Biyun] dodged several times, but the nun's arm technique was extremely fast.
1:25:42|1:25:54|[Taoist Biyun] was forced to retreat repeatedly, seeing the situation turning unfavorable. Seizing the opportunity, [Taoist Biyun] leaped into the air using the tree stump behind him, and while airborne, kicked out his right foot towards the wrist of [Nun Bikuang].
1:25:54|1:26:12|The nun, caught off guard, slid back several meters. She quickly regained her composure and the two engaged in combat once again. The sound of fists and floating dust in the air was deafening, and the fight became increasingly intense. Both sides repeatedly tested each other, unable to determine who had the upper hand.
1:26:13|1:26:29|After speaking, [Master Biyun] wrapped the floating dust in [Master Bikong]'s hand around his arm, dragging her arm back like a swift arrow for about 10 meters. He quickly kicked towards the scapula of [Master Bikong], who did not show weakness and swung the floating dust in her hand.
1:26:29|1:26:49|Every time heading towards [Master Biyun]'s vital point. However, the situation has become difficult to reverse. [Master Biyun] exerted all his strength to break the floating dust with one palm, then slapped her against the tree with the other palm. [Master Bikong] hit her waist on the tree, screamed in pain, spat blood, and fell to the ground unable to get up.
1:28:46|1:29:4|After listening to the words of [Master Biyun], [Princess Ziyun] took out her own jade pendant, and [Dong Haichuan] also took out the jade pendant of [Xuelian]. The two jade pendants turned out to be identical. Tears filled [Dong Haichuan]'s eyes.
1:29:56|1:30:9|[Dong Haichuan] left Xishan with a knowing smile, leaving [Ziyun] standing there in a state of confusion.
1:30:35|1:30:42|[Dong Haichuan] behind him heard all this, his ambitious nature revealed.
1:32:34|1:32:53|Iron Shackles Yin Fu and [Dong Haichuan] stood in a clearing. Iron Shackles [Yin Fu] clenched his hands tightly in front of his chest, exerted a little force, and then rushed towards [Dong Haichuan], but was struck on the back of the head by [Dong Haichuan] after just a few moves, and fell to the ground with a thud. Unwilling to accept defeat, he rolled over and arched his back.
1:32:53|1:33:8|With a fierce kick, trying to bring down [Dong Haichuan], [Dong Haichuan] turned around and hung, then both palms struck solidly on his chest. [Yin Fu], who fell to the ground, clenched his forehead with blue veins, holding his painful chest and struggling to stand up.
1:35:52|1:36:13|In the blink of an eye, it was the Huayang International Kung Fu Competition organized by the Eight-Nation Alliance. The drums by the arena were deafening, with foreign kung fu teams and skilled warriors from the Qing Dynasty seated on both sides. Emperor Xianfeng and the royal ministers sat on a high platform. A man, who had cut off his queue and was dressed in Western attire, slowly walked to the center of the stage.
1:36:25|1:36:44|The crowd under the stage formed a circle, with voices clamoring and chaotic, sitting on the stage, [Prince] was full of confidence towards the Qing Dynasty generals, only [Dong Haichuan] looked worriedly at the bare-chested Western strong man on the stage, looking at the person about to fight opposite, his expression full of provocation and contempt.
1:36:50|1:37:2|With the sound of the gong, the competition on the stage officially begins. The foreigner is rubbing his fists in excitement, while the Qing Dynasty warrior shows no weakness, delivering a fierce punch and then kicking the foreigner in the stomach.
1:37:16|1:37:36|The foreigner raised his hands in victory shout, then a Qing Dynasty warrior rushed onto the stage, displaying powerful martial arts moves. The foreigners in the world kung fu team couldn't help but laugh at this scene. The audience below whispered about the upcoming battle.
1:37:36|1:37:59|The sound of gongs and drums rang out again. The newly arrived Qing Dynasty military officer launched an attack, but before getting into position, he was knocked down by a foreigner. Faced with another failure, the atmosphere among the audience dropped to freezing point. [Fourth Prince] and many royal ministers showed a worried expression, only [Prince Xiao] remained calm and composed, sitting steadily among them.
1:38:2|1:38:27|Emperor Xianfeng looked worriedly at the audience with a dark face. Fortunately, another Qing dynasty general stepped forward to challenge shortly after. However, the opponent was too strong. After just a few moves, he was knocked down by a foreigner. Seeing the generals being defeated one after another, [Dong Haichuan] could no longer sit still. He stood up straight and walked onto the stage under the gaze of the crowd.
1:38:27|1:38:40|Seeing [Dong Haichuan] take the stage, the royal minister seemed to have been injected with a shot of adrenaline. The foreigner who was defeated by [Dong Haichuan] on the street realized the situation was not good, he knew very well that [Dong Haichuan] was not someone to mess with.
1:38:50|1:39:2|[Dong Haichuan] and the foreigner's confrontation began. At the start, the foreigner sneered mockingly, then pressed forward step by step, with fierce punches, each move made with total disregard for his own safety.
1:39:3|1:39:24|Although the moves were not very exquisite, the inherent killing intent was enough to be frightening. [Dong Haichuan] remained calm, then leaned back and swung both fists to draw an arc in the air, one after another. With a vigorous palm wind accompanied by a shout, the foreigner instantly staggered back step by step, causing an uproar among the audience.
1:39:34|1:39:51|The audience below the stage saw this scene and cheered enthusiastically. Emperor Xianfeng saw the situation turning around and the gloom on his face also lessened. Another muscular foreign strongman, shirtless, entered the stage, [Dong Haichuan], facing the enemy head-on amidst the cheers of the crowd.
1:39:55|1:40:8|Having circled around the foreign strong man a few times, without understanding the opponent's tactics, [Dong Haichuan] chose to cautiously attack. Unexpectedly, while dodging backwards, he exposed a weakness and took a solid punch from the opponent.
1:40:8|1:40:21|Obviously, this foreigner's martial arts skills are not weak. His boxing is powerful and swift. [Dong Haichuan] seized the opportunity and struck back with a palm, countering the foreigner's previous punch. The foreigner's face became even more unsightly, but he continued to charge forward recklessly.
1:40:21|1:40:33|After several rounds of confrontation, [Dong Haichuan] seemed to have figured out the foreigner's moves. He attacked and defended in an orderly manner, leaving clear marks on the foreigner's bare upper body. Taking advantage of the foreigner's evasion,
1:40:33|1:40:54|[Dong Haichuan] knocked him down with one move, the foreign strong man flipped in the air to get up, furious like a bull. But before he could get close to [Dong Haichuan], he was struck in the neck by a palm, followed by another palm straight to his chin. The foreign strong man's body soared into the air, and [Dong Haichuan] pressed him down with another palm on the ground.
1:41:8|1:41:23|The audience below was even more excited, shouting his name loudly after this battle. [Dong Haichuan] not only lifted the people's spirits and made the Qing government proud, but also received a plaque personally inscribed by Emperor Xianfeng himself as the Grandmaster of Baguazhang.
1:41:23|1:41:45|The crowd is banging gongs and drums, while [Dong Haichuan]'s disciple carries a plaque through the streets and hangs it on the gate of the martial arts school. The sound of gongs and drums is incessant, mixed with the crackling of firecrackers, creating a lively atmosphere. A large number of disciples gather in front of the martial arts school, lining up on both sides.
1:41:49|1:41:56|[Dong Haichuan] clasped his hands together and bowed to the disciples around him, then said meaningfully.
1:42:7|1:42:24|He looked at the disciples with a knowing smile. Today, he finally fulfilled Master Bai's wish, integrating various martial arts into one, creating his own Baguazhang, becoming a martial arts grandmaster of his generation, and gradually promoting Wudang's martial arts.
