0:1:27|0:1:57|In the sky above the city, a group of white doves fly by, marking the beginning of the film. On the building where the doves flew past, a female news anchor on an electronic screen is broadcasting the news. Following a feather down, two security guards run out of the building, chasing a thief.
0:2:6|0:2:23|On the road, five cars are waiting. In the front car, a man in a suit looks serious. He is [Ou Jian], the one on the cover of Time Weekly on the electronic screen. He picks up the phone next to him and puts it to his ear.
0:2:26|0:2:44|[Qu Jian] closed his eyes helplessly, his hand resting on the steering wheel. He pursed his lips, turned his head away from the phone, blinked, and then fiercely threw the phone onto the passenger seat. He reached up to loosen his silent tie, opened his hand, pressed his index finger against his brow, and squeezed his eyes shut.
0:2:45|0:3:4|After standing up slightly, [Fei Xin] placed his index finger and thumb on his forehead. Suddenly, he heard the horn behind him, raised his head abruptly, and glanced at the traffic light diagonally above, which was already showing green. He quickly shifted gears, but found that he couldn't move the gear lever. He pushed it hard twice, but it remained stuck in place.
0:3:4|0:3:11|He repeatedly turned the key, but the car didn't respond for a long time. He pounded the steering wheel hard, the sense of urgency causing sweat to bead on his face.
0:3:12|0:3:19|Finally, as he turned the key again, the car responded, and the car behind stopped honking, passing through the intersection one after another.
0:3:21|0:3:40|Ou Jian's car drove to a place with a downward slope. As he was about to pass through the slope, a car in front of him suddenly fell straight down. He quickly hit the brakes, crossed his arms to protect his head. Fortunately, the falling car flipped forward, narrowly missing him. With his heart still racing, he lifted his head, looked at the car in front of him, and then glanced around.
0:3:40|0:3:47|After getting off the car and closing the door, he looked around while approaching the smoking overturned vehicle, bending down to look inside.
0:3:51|0:4:10|Then he knelt down on one knee, tapping on the car window, only to find that there was no one inside the car. Fei Xin stood up, mouth agape, looking around, and after calming down a bit, he looked up at the overhead ring road. Frowning, he lowered his head and saw a parked electric bike on the cement ground next to him, with a cat lying on it, meeting Fei Xin's gaze perfectly.
0:4:14|0:4:37|The scene shifts to a dimly lit room, where a man swiftly puts on a leather jacket and approaches with sunglasses on. After passing through several dimly lit rooms, the man enters an echoing garage. As the rolling shutter slowly rises, the man opens the car door, sits down, puts on leather gloves, and starts the car.
0:4:40|0:4:58|In a blink of an eye, [Fei Xin] followed a man in sportswear as they walked through the corridor of the house and arrived at the outdoor balcony. The man in sportswear also wore sunglasses and chewed gum in his mouth. Next to the pool on the outdoor balcony stood a police officer, with a female corpse floating in the middle of the pool.
0:4:58|0:5:4|The man took the disposable gloves handed to him by the two people as he walked towards the young man who was explaining the situation.
0:5:31|0:5:35|Officer Chen, who is here to take over the job, stands with hands on hips.
0:5:40|0:5:42|He waved at [Qiu Le], who was looking at the corpse.
0:6:32|0:6:50|[Fei Xin] turned around, looked at the deceased's husband who was asking questions, then turned back and waved to the subordinate behind Officer Chen, signaling him to come over. Later, [Fei Xin] pushed the subordinate into the shadow pool.
0:7:1|0:7:23|Fei Xin walked up to Officer Chen after splashing around in the pool for a bit, only to find that the water was only up to his waist. He then walked over to the deceased's husband, patted him on the back, and took an envelope out of his pocket. Officer Chen took the envelope from Fei Xin's hand, and Fei Xin then walked over to the still crying family members.
0:7:31|0:7:40|The man questioned by [Fei Xin] clearly froze. "Come on," the man even thought about attacking the deceased's husband, [Fei Xin] shook her head with a smile.
0:7:45|0:7:51|Zhang opens his arms wide and gestures. Qiu Le nods and gives a few instructions.
0:7:55|0:8:23|Qiu Le got up to leave, with his subordinate who was explaining the situation following him with a smile, but he was grabbed by Officer Chen by the collar. The scene shifted to a flashback, where a thief was running wildly on the street, and Qiu Le, wearing a tank top and floral shorts, saw the danger and started running, with the police shouting for him to stop.
0:8:25|0:8:48|[Qiu Le] just passed the police, then slowed down and pulled out the gun from his waist. With one shot, he hit the thief's leg. The thief held his leg, and the scene shifted to another action. A team of police officers were approaching the abandoned building cautiously with guns raised against the wall. On the other side, there was another team. Both teams were ready to surround the abandoned building, crouching low.
0:8:48|0:8:51|Trying not to make too much noise, afraid of alerting the criminals inside.
0:8:55|0:9:15|A car suddenly drove up, and [Qiu Le] got out of the car and closed the door. He raised his index finger and then pulled out the gun from his waist. Seeing that he had already moved forward, his colleagues could only grit their teeth and follow. Unexpectedly, as soon as [Qiu Le] entered the door, he encountered the ambush of the guards. It was only when he turned around that he noticed.
0:9:21|0:9:24|A hand is flipping through photos of [Qiu Le]'s swollen face from the injury.
0:9:41|0:9:56|[Niu Jieshi] took the file and handed it to the superior. On the document in [Qiu Le]'s hand, the big title read "Dismissal Order" due to his aggressive personality, causing too many unnecessary casualties, leading to his removal from the police force.
0:9:56|0:10:2|[Qiu Le] left the police station with a teddy bear in one hand, a birthday gift he had just received, and a cardboard box in the other.
0:10:4|0:10:16|The scene shifts to [Fei Xin], who has rushed to the hospital and is sitting outside the delivery room, waiting. People are coming and going around him, but he remains in the same position until a nurse pushes a cart towards him.
0:10:21|0:10:38|In Fei Xin's perspective, the nurse's eyes that were revealed were staring at her fiercely, and the surgical knife on the cart was also pointing towards her. As the cart approached, Fei Xin leaned back in fear, but the nurse turned the corner and looked at the nurse who had just called her name and then turned around, muttering softly to herself.
0:10:43|0:10:51|After shouting, [Fei Xin] took a deep breath, looked at the sign of the delivery room for a few seconds, and instead of walking towards it, turned around and left.
0:10:51|0:11:2|He arrived at the underground parking lot, walking under the dim lights. Suddenly, a car with its headlights on stopped in front of him. The bright lights dazzled him as he raised his hand and turned to look, only to see a short-haired beauty getting out of the car.
0:11:3|0:11:19|He walked towards the beautiful woman, put down the woman's car, and brushed past her. The man in the driver's seat, wearing sunglasses, made eye contact with [Qu Jian] before driving away as much as possible. The short-haired beauty smiled at [Qu Jian] and as he approached, she spoke.
0:11:22|0:11:27|[Ou Jian] nodded, clenched his hands tightly, and held the car keys in his hands.
0:11:34|0:11:59|[Ou Jian] nodded, the short-haired beauty looked at him and broke the silence. [Ou Jian] nodded and put the car keys in the other hand. The scene shifted indoors, the short-haired beauty walked in carrying a flower basket. [Shen Jiamei] walked to the changing table.
0:12:12|0:12:23|[Shen Jiamei] looked around the room, thought for a moment, then turned around and asked. [Nan Fang] put away his smile, pursed his lips, lowered his head and let out a sigh.
0:12:39|0:12:56|[Nan Fang] thought for a moment, then pursed his lips as if confirming something, the scene shifted to [Fei Xin]. He quickly walked into the restaurant, brushing past a man, looking puzzled for a moment. However, he didn't linger too long and continued walking in. He glanced at [Qiu Le], then sat down near the entrance.
0:12:56|0:13:6|[Qiu Le] was looking at his phone and drinking cola, then he put down the cup and asked. [Fei Xin] responded while holding a fork.
0:14:21|0:14:29|After they got married, her husband pursued her, but then he started to become increasingly indifferent towards her.
0:14:51|0:15:9|Turning his head, the two had finished their meal. [Qiu Le] sat on a chair while [Fei Xin] picked up a ping pong paddle, pausing to catch his breath before setting it down. [Fei Xin] also walked over to sit in front of the chair, grabbing a bottle of alcohol from the table and taking a big gulp, then turning to ask.
0:15:16|0:15:25|The dog at home hung its head as if drunk. The door slowly opened, revealing [Qu Jian], the person outside the door.
0:15:28|0:15:33|[Ou Jian] took the document bag handed by the delivery man and watched him leave before closing the door.
0:15:56|0:16:12|[Ou Jian] saw the news report on TV. He quickly opened his briefcase, took out the insurance policy inside, flipped through a few pages, and looked at the bottom where the beneficiary was listed with his name. After a moment of contemplation, he raised his head and looked towards the direction of the bedroom. The scene then shifted to the bedroom.
0:16:12|0:16:23|[Ou Jian] stood at the dark doorway for a while before walking inside. The man sitting on the edge of the bed was holding a baby. As he passed by the window, his figure darkened due to the backlight.
0:16:26|0:16:34|[Nan Fang] heard a voice, turned around, smiled at him, looked back at the baby in his arms, then stood up, put the baby back on the changing table, and sat down again.
0:16:38|0:16:48|[Ou Jian] turned his head. He turned back.
0:16:53|0:17:3|[Nan Fang] widened his eyes, pulled the corners of his mouth, and Ou Jian spoke again. [Nan Fang] didn't know how to respond, lowered his head, but Ou Jian continued speaking.
0:17:22|0:17:28|[Nan Fang] finished speaking while holding his waist, and Ou Jian, after listening to his explanation, turned his head and took a deep breath.
0:17:39|0:17:47|[Nan Fang] looked up at her husband, waiting for his reaction, but he just turned his head slightly without saying anything. [Nan Fang] pursed her lips and said.
0:17:52|0:18:14|After speaking, she lifted the diaper with one hand and exerted herself to stand up. Ou Jian still maintained a sideways posture, not looking at her, just quietly turning his head and sighing. As she passed by Ou Jian, [Nan Fang], who had just reached Ou Jian's shoulder, glanced at him, then supported her waist with her hand and walked towards the bathroom.
0:18:14|0:18:19|Sensing Nan Fang's departure, Ou Jian finally turned his head and looked at Nan Fang's back.
0:18:32|0:18:41|He then put down his phone, turned around and looked through the blinds at [Qu Jian] outside. At that moment, [Qu Jian] was standing near the changing table, gazing at the child in the wall.
0:18:44|0:19:5|The child opened his mouth and looked at him. [Qu Jian] reached out his hand, stopped just before getting close to the child's face, paused for a moment, then looked up at the bathroom. He then clenched his fist next to the changing table, and the man behind the bathroom window saw this scene and pressed the flush button on the toilet.
0:19:42|0:19:59|Next, the next Korean client took out a gun and placed it on the table, while two burly men also pulled out their guns. The newly added dog pushed them away forcefully, and the client began to speak.
0:20:22|0:20:32|The scene shifts to the trading scene, hello, the leader of the Tai Palace with her hands clasped together, the traitor in front of her has a face similar to [Qiu Le].
0:20:45|0:21:1|Trading begins inside the building, Tai Fang opens the money bag, while the other side opens the bag to reveal a toy gun. Both sides immediately raise their guns and confront each other. The traitor outside takes out a phone, ignites an explosion, and runs off with the money and guns. What a bastard.
0:21:10|0:21:19|The client leaned forward to take off his glasses, then put them back on. Across from him, [Fei Xin] quickly took off his sunglasses, couldn't help but smile when he saw clearly.
0:22:16|0:22:18|Later, [Qu Jian] walked in.
0:22:37|0:22:39|[Fei Xin] got up and took the letter.
0:22:46|0:23:2|[Fei Xin] took the letter and walked out with his head down, waving his hand and putting on sunglasses. Soon, the two arrived at a café and leaned against the door frame to take a look. At that moment, the man with glasses was sitting with his head down, and [Fei Xin] walked ahead to greet him.
0:23:14|0:23:16|[Nan Fang] watches as the two whisper to each other.
0:23:32|0:23:38|[Fei Xin] finished speaking, then turned to ask for [Qiu Le]'s opinion. [Qiu Le] had already given the OK sign with his hand, took the photo handed over by [Nan Fang], and [Fei Xin] sighed.
0:23:43|0:23:47|[Qiu Le] looked at [Nan Fang], who awkwardly touched his neck, and [Fei Xin] asked.
0:23:51|0:23:54|[Nan Fang] raised the hand next to his neck and took off his glasses.
0:24:11|0:24:14|Bei Xing held the ice just pulled out and handed over the coffee.
0:24:39|0:24:48|[Fei Xin] took the paper off and placed it on the table. [Nan Fang] picked up the paper and looked at it, while [Fei Xin] gestured to [Qiu Le].
0:24:51|0:25:2|[Qiu Le] took out a book from his pocket, [Fei Xin] took it and then took the pen, handing it to [Nan Fang]. [Nan Fang] took the book and the pen.
0:25:14|0:25:21|[Nan Fang] nodded awkwardly, then wrote on the rabbit card as requested, signed his name, and said as he closed the pen cap.
0:25:31|0:25:33|[Fei Xin] handed the book to [Qiu Le] and smiled.
0:25:43|0:26:2|The man smiled and put on his glasses, watching as the two of them left. The smile disappeared from his face. Then, the scene shifted to an alley. The alley is located in Ping'an Yicun South Village at 27 Changbao Third Road. As the girl on the electric bike rode out of the intersection, it can be seen that [Nan Fang] has just arrived here.
0:26:2|0:26:5|She arrived at a household, with two door gods' portraits still pasted on the glass door.
0:26:7|0:26:18|He gently closed the door, then slowly turned around, illuminating everything in the room. In the small living room, on the table directly facing the door, there was a portrait of a woman.
0:26:18|0:26:30|[Nan Fang] stared at the memorial for a moment, lowered his head, picked up the photo frame on the table. In the frame, he and [Ou Jian] were holding hands and facing the camera, with the words "National Special" visible in the background. His mind was pulled back to the past.
0:26:32|0:26:51|That was when he was in South Korea, walking with his head down and carrying a bag in the snow. Three large posters of Ou Jian were pasted on the closed shutter door by the roadside. He stopped and looked at the posters, with snow falling continuously around him. One shining brightly on the world stage, the other coolly entering prison.
0:26:51|0:27:6|Tesla stepped on the snow, the surroundings were eerily quiet, only the sound of the wind echoing by. The scene transitioned to a cemetery after turning black, with Tesla standing in front of a grave, the tombstone read "Xie Shijun, born on October 17, 1953, passed away on June 18, 2013."
0:27:10|0:27:28|The photo on the tombstone is the same as the woman on the tombstone. In the middle of the cemetery surrounded by trees, tears silently fall from [Fei Xin]'s eyes. She recalls her days in prison, the scene shifts to the cold prison. [Fei Xin] has bandages on her forehead, leaning against the wall.
0:27:28|0:27:31|Not long ago, [Shen Jiamei] got up from the bathhouse, and there were already people standing outside the pool.
0:27:32|0:27:50|One person smashed a basin towards her, the person behind caught her as she fell, and pushed her forward, her head engraved on the edge of the pool. Someone grabbed her hair, but she used both hands to pull the person's neck and dragged him into the pool. Then she pressed with one hand and ruthlessly punched with the other hand.
0:27:51|0:27:59|The man broke free, and someone outside the pool grabbed Fei Xin from behind, raising another hand to stab him with a pen.
0:28:9|0:28:28|Then he pushed the opponent's head against the wall, fiercely smashing it against the wall. At this moment, a burly man rushed over from behind and grabbed [Tesla], while another companion came up and punched him in the abdomen. But as soon as the punch came down, [Tesla] shook off the burly man behind him, swung his fist and knocked the person who punched him to the ground.
0:28:28|0:28:44|He continued to crouch down and fight on. The burly man who had just been thrown off came forward again to grab him, but he forcefully pushed his head back, causing the man to fall down in pain. Then [Tesla], with his face covered in his own and someone else's blood, crouched down again and collapsed on the ground.
0:28:44|0:28:57|The memory ends, [Tesla] takes out a photo while walking, lights it with a lighter, and then throws it on the ground. The scene shifts to [Fei Xin] and [Qiu Le], who are sitting inside a large company waiting for an interview.
0:29:22|0:29:33|[Qiu Le] turned back and leaned in again. [Fei Xin] turned around impatiently and asked. [Qiu Le] awkwardly touched his chin, and [Fei Xin] began to speak.
0:30:14|0:30:26|The person at the desk thanked him with a handshake and was about to follow the HR, [Qiu Le] moved the chair to let him pass. In the office at that moment, the man with a beard was speaking with food in his mouth, he picked up a teacup, choked a bit, and looked up.
0:30:52|0:30:55|[Qu Jian] smiled and turned his head, then looked at him again.
0:31:9|0:31:22|[Ou Jian] turned his head to the side in silence, muttering to himself. After work, [Ou Jian] went to the gym, where the tracking of [Fei Xin] and him continued. [Fei Xin] was seen doing a handstand, with blood rushing to his head.
0:31:26|0:31:41|Over there, [Qu Jian] is giving a massage to a plump beauty, occasionally stealing glances at her. On this side, [Fei Xin] can no longer hold on and puts his leg down. Meanwhile, [Qu Jian] has started practicing boxing. [Fei Xin] and [Qiu Le] are struggling to lift their legs.
0:31:41|0:31:51|[Fei Xin] is observing [Qu Jian] closely even as they engage in their final training. Glancing at his training partner's buttocks, [Fei Xin] watches [Qu Jian] punch with unwavering focus.
0:31:52|0:32:5|Fei Xin just peeked at the voluptuous beauty of Ou Jian, saw the fierceness of Ou Jian's boxing, pulled the corners of his mouth, turned around and left. After the workout, Ou Jian changed back into formal wear and walked into the elevator. As the elevator door was about to close, it was stopped by a hand.
0:32:5|0:32:10|Previously in the parking lot, after [Shen Jiamei]'s man walked in, Ou Jian glanced at him and pressed the close button again.
0:32:11|0:32:26|The elevator doors closed, and Fei Xin and Qiu Le stood side by side. Ou Jian touched his face, his hand dropping unnaturally, remembering how this man had been staring at him while driving, recalling the surgical knife on the hospital cart, and the car that had crashed in front of him on the road.
0:32:27|0:32:41|At this moment, [Shen Jiamei]'s man reached for his waist, and Ou Jian immediately reacted by placing one hand on his chest and pushing him against the elevator wall. A bunch of keys fell to the ground, and the gun at his waist also slipped out.
0:32:41|0:32:58|Ou Jian looked down and, taking advantage of the opportunity, the man immediately pushed Ou Jian back and threw a punch. But Ou Jian quickly reacted, fought back, and knocked the man down. As the elevator reached the floor, [Ou Jian] quickly walked out, leaving the man sitting on the ground panting, putting on sunglasses.
0:32:58|0:33:5|Soon after, at the exit of the parking lot, [Fei Xin] saw [Qiu Le] driving out and parking in front of him.
0:33:14|0:33:19|And so, the two of them lost track of each other. The scene transitions to nighttime, inside a bar, where the customers are chatting.
0:33:44|0:33:50|[Ou Jian] took a sip of wine, loosened his tie, and his friend next to him wearing a hat took out a stack of papers from his back pocket and handed it to him.
0:33:59|0:34:3|The other person sighed. [Qu Jian] looked up at him.
0:34:11|0:34:17|A friend's phone rang, and he raised his hand to answer the phone.
0:34:29|0:34:50|[Qu Jian] looked at the call records on the paper, noticed what he said, raised his head, and stared at his friend's mouth moving in contemplation. After the friend finished the call and sat down, [Qu Jian]'s phone rang, he picked it up and saw it was a call from the man, then hung up the phone, staring at his friend until the other party noticed his gaze.
0:34:58|0:35:2|A friend patted his arm, but he remained motionless.
0:35:15|0:35:19|Before the friend could speak, they were hit on the head by someone.
0:35:33|0:35:42|[Qiu Le] pulled his friend and ran outside, but was surrounded by several people. The scene shifted to an electronics mall, where [Fei Xin] walked into a store and the boss asked.
0:35:45|0:36:3|On the shelf are various high-end tech products, [Fei Xin] squats in front of a row of shelves picking things out. He then moves to a monitor, his face appearing on the screen, and then heads to another store. The shop is in darkness, dim light shining on his face as he asks the owner at the table.
0:36:13|0:36:26|The boss took a laptop from the shelf next to him and handed it to Fei Xin, who rang it briefly before leaving. In the alley next to the electronics city, an electric car drove by as Fei Xin stood against the wall talking on the phone.
0:36:26|0:36:41|Next, he hung up the phone and arrived at a van, opened the computer he just received, on the left side of the screen was his own photo, and on the right side, matching began, several photos of men and women flashed by, until finally [Qiu Le]'s photo appeared, with a surprising similarity of 98%.
0:36:43|0:37:0|Next, [Fei Xin] went to the bathroom, took off his glasses in front of the mirror, and placed them on the sink. Then he picked up the comb and hair dye next to him, squeezed the dye onto the comb, and started dyeing his hair. [Fei Xin]'s hair turned much whiter, while [Qiu Le] still had black hair.
0:37:0|0:37:8|He took the hair dye and combed it back one by one, and then picked up the eyebrow pencil to touch up his eyebrows.
0:37:12|0:37:22|The scene shifts to the front desk of a hotel, where a hand places [Qiu Le]'s ID card. The receptionist takes it, glances at it, then looks back at the ID card, smiling.
0:37:28|0:37:43|The receptionist walked to the side. The person standing in front of the reception desk was [Qiu Le], who looked exactly like [Fei Xin]. He was wearing a checkered shirt, carrying a bag and luggage, and opening a room door. The camera then moved to [Nan Fang]'s home, where he was sitting on the sofa reading a book.
0:37:43|0:37:53|Outside the glass window, Ou Jian just arrived at the door and opened it. [Nan Fang] looked up, set the book in his hand aside. Just as he was about to take off his glasses, his hand paused for a moment.
0:37:54|0:38:20|He took off his glasses and stood up, reaching out to touch Fei Xin's face. Fei Xin quickly dodged and then grabbed his arm. With his head down, Fei Xin finished speaking and was about to leave. Nan Fang's hand hung in the air, with a complex emotion in his eyes. Fei Xin walked upstairs, Nan Fang closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and lowered his head.
0:38:24|0:38:47|He turned around and picked up his phone, at this moment Ou Jian was looking at him from the corner of the stairs. Ou Jian stood on the stairs and thought for a moment. When Nan Fang left, he used his phone on the second floor to capture Nan Fang getting into the car.
0:38:48|0:39:10|After the man got on the car, Fei Xin leaned his body against the seat, thought for a moment, and then raised his eyes. The camera turned to a sign that read "Running for Dad". As the starting gun went off, many children and parents started running from under the sign. The man pushed a stroller and walked side by side with Shen Jiamei, chatting.
0:39:11|0:39:21|In the parking lot not far away, [Qu Jian] sat in the car, holding up a cellphone. At the same time, in a dimly lit room, two screens were lit up, with [Fei Xin] operating on a laptop.
0:39:23|0:39:42|Back at the parking lot, [Ou Jian] in the car is holding a phone, staring at the screen showing [Nan Fang] walking. Meanwhile, [Tesla] is sitting at a table holding a phone, with the screen showing [Ou Jian] holding a phone. The [Ou Jian] facing the camera is unaware that he is being watched, still monitoring [Nan Fang].
0:39:42|0:39:51|On the screen, [Qu Jian] furrowed his brow while [Nan Fang] leisurely took a bite of the apple on the table. The scene then shifted to inside the coffee shop, where [Fei Xin] spoke to [Nan Fang].
0:42:9|0:42:29|[Fei Xin] turned his open hand over, the pen drew a leaf and then bent, indicating agreement. The man standing up put on sunglasses and left. Following his gaze, [Tesla], wearing a duckbill cap, was sitting at a table outside with high-end glasses purchased from the electronics city, keeping an eye on them.
0:42:29|0:42:31|On the phone screen are [Qiu Le] and [Fei Xin] being aimed at by sunglasses.
0:42:40|0:43:0|The scene shifts to a dock, where [Qu Jian] gets out of the car and looks through various information about [Nan Fang]. A phone number on the bill catches his attention. He puts down the bill and dials the number. Meanwhile, [Fei Xin], who is going upstairs at [Nan Fang]'s house, answers the phone.
0:43:3|0:43:5|[Fei Xin] confronted [Nan Fang].
0:43:14|0:43:33|[Ou Jian] heard the voice of [Nan Fang] coming from the phone, furrowing his brows in confusion. But soon, he opened the car door and got in, while [Nan Fang] was greeting [Fei Xin]. [Fei Xin] opened the wardrobe in the bedroom and took a look, smelling something.
0:43:38|0:43:50|[Nan Fang] pointed to the door and said. [Fei Xin] walked outside and first noticed the Time magazine cover on the wall. Then, she looked down and scanned the room, looking at the photo frame on the table. She picked up the photo frame.
0:43:53|0:43:56|[Nan Fang] followed her gaze to the wall.
0:44:0|0:44:2|She lowered her head, as if remembering something.
0:44:13|0:44:27|[Nan Fang] pointed upstairs and walked up, with [Fei Xin] putting down the photo frame and following. On the other side, [Qiu Le] was driving home, following the decorative lights in the neighborhood all the way home. Meanwhile, [Qu Jian] was sitting in the car by the roadside, keeping watch.
0:44:27|0:44:41|With one hand on the steering wheel and the other resting on the car window, chewing gum in his mouth, [Qiu Le] was in a hurry. However, after turning a corner, the car suddenly exploded. He got out of the car, took a quick look, and quickly decided to run back home.
0:44:41|0:44:48|[Qiu Le] took big strides, watching as home got closer and closer, but his steps became more hurried, even his breathing quickened a bit.
0:44:49|0:45:11|[Qiu Le] happened to see a security guard at his doorstep and leaned over to ask him. Just as [Qiu Le] got out of the car, Ou Jian reached out behind him. [Qiu Le] turned around and Ou Jian froze. After giving him a glance, [Qiu Le] walked away quickly, leaving Ou Jian still in a daze.
0:45:11|0:45:16|He glanced at the car, then looked in the direction [Qiu Le] had left, and then ran back home.
0:45:17|0:45:35|Upon entering, the room was pitch black with no lights on. Ou Jian closed the door, took off his shoes, and cautiously walked inside. He first scanned the living room, found nothing unusual, then looked up towards the second floor. Standing downstairs, he saw the light shining from the bedroom on the second floor.
0:45:35|0:45:44|Think about it, take out the phone from the pocket, check the call records, and dial the same number again. Then, the phone on the second floor rings.
0:46:8|0:46:23|In the room of the marriage case, both of them took a breath, [Qu Jian] said. He lowered his head, then walked out towards the door. The man gently pressed, and after [Qu Jian] walked a little further, he turned his head while turning his body, and got off the bed with his legs.
0:46:23|0:46:28|Reaching under the pillow, [Fei Xin] took out another cellphone and then placed it on the bedside table.
0:46:29|0:46:45|After doing all this, she quickly turned her head as if she saw someone blocking her, but found no one there. She looked anxiously at the door, breathing heavily, and slowly calmed down.
0:46:45|0:47:4|It was late at night outside. Under the dim lights, [Qu Jian] looked down from the second-floor balcony and noticed [Qiu Le]'s car. He then walked downstairs, checked inside the car to make sure no one was there, and looked around. Afterwards, he carefully approached the car and realized that the car window was not closed.
0:47:4|0:47:11|He then turned back again to make sure no one was around, and reached his hand from outside the car window into the driver's seat, continuously feeling for the left turn signal.
0:47:12|0:47:18|After touching a book, it was taken out and opened to the first page, which was the fairy tale book written by [Nan Fang].
0:47:18|0:47:33|[Ou Jian] was shocked when he saw this book. He carefully flipped through it under the dim light, with [Nan Fang]'s rabbit signature next to it, his signature particularly eye-catching. He kept flipping the book back and forth, with a somewhat solemn expression.
0:47:33|0:47:39|Ou Jian lifted his head, his eyes rolling, while over where the car slipped away, Fei Xin was in distress.
0:48:11|0:48:28|The scene shifts to [Qu Jian], sitting at his desk in distress. He raises the glass in his hand and takes a sip of wine. After placing the cup on the table, he reaches up to loosen his tie. As he tilts his head to the other side, it seems like he has remembered something.
0:48:28|0:48:34|He then opened the drawer next to him and took out a photo frame, which contained a picture of two people posing together.
0:48:50|0:49:9|Watching the photo and sinking into memories, [Qu Jian] took another sip of wine. Then he got up and walked to the wardrobe, opened the door, and found a cardboard box underneath the hanging white shirt. He took out a baseball bat from it, then walked to the center of the living room with the bat in hand. After a moment of contemplation, he swung the bat in different directions.
0:49:9|0:49:28|The baseball bat rested against the tiger's mouth, the body slightly pulled back, hands gripping the bat as it swung forward with force. Whispering something silently, the character then paused after two swings, placing two fingers on the lower lip in contemplation, gesturing with the hand to indicate a position.
0:49:28|0:49:39|He walked to the corner of the wall and put down the bat, raised both hands to gesture the position, and then slowly put them down. At the same time, he closed his eyes and rehearsed possible scenarios in his mind.
0:49:39|0:49:53|A masked man holding a dagger stabbed him from behind, he grabbed the man's arm with one hand and placed the other arm under the man's armpit, then forcefully knocked him down to the ground. The masked man reacted quickly, raised his other hand, but was blocked by [Qiu Le].
0:49:53|0:50:10|At the same time, the masked man quickly got up and threw punches left and right, but was dodged by [Qiu Le], who then controlled one of his arms in the same way. However, this time the masked man reacted in time and managed to force [Qiu Le] to lie on the table. As [Qiu Le] raised his hand to block him, he got up, jumped off the table, and pinned him to the ground.
0:50:10|0:50:26|He looked up and saw the baseball bat in the corner of the wall. Just as he was about to reach for it, he was stabbed by the masked man. As the drill ended, [Qiu Le] shook his head, moved the baseball bat closer to the cabinet, and started the drill again. This time, after knocking down the masked man, he picked up the bat and knocked him unconscious.
0:50:29|0:50:44|The scene shifts to [Fei Xin], who is sitting at a table entering information into a computer. The search bar displays the name [Qiu Le], and the interface switches to show another side where Tesla is also busy on the computer. Soon, [Fei Xin]'s computer screen instantly shows no relevant pages.
0:50:46|0:50:59|As the lines of code were completed one by one, [Fei Xin] returned and entered again, only to quickly find that it still redirected to an unrelated page. Finally, Tesla's computer displayed "data cleared," prompting an annoyed exclamation from [Fei Xin].
0:51:3|0:51:18|The information on the computer interface disappeared in front of [Fei Xin]. He touched his face with his hand, then the screen turned black and shifted to a bar, where [Qiu Le] was sitting at the bar counter, pouring the small glass of liquor in front of him into a larger glass.
0:51:20|0:51:25|He, who had already drunk a lot beforehand, picked up the wine glass and finished it in one gulp.
0:51:33|0:51:36|At this moment, a beautiful woman walked over to him and asked:
0:51:48|0:51:51|Just as he was about to finish drinking, a hand reached over and took his wine glass.
0:51:56|0:52:16|[Tang Chan] took the wine glass, brought it to his lips, took a sip, then propped his head with one hand and looked at [Ou Jian]. [Ou Jian] picked up the jar again, ready to pour the remaining small wine glasses, but was taken away by [Tang Chan]. [Tang Chan] gave him a shaky look and then poured the two small wine glasses into the big cup.
0:52:16|0:52:21|[Fei Xin] turned to look at him, picked up a glass of wine, leaned forward, and said to [Fei Xin].
0:52:25|0:52:40|The two looked at each other and smiled, then [Tang Chen] drank the wine in his hand, and [Ou Jian] also finished the wine in his glass in one gulp. Shortly after, [Ou Jian] was helped by [Tang Chen] to the hotel, where he threw his coat onto the bed and then lay down on the bed.
0:52:41|0:52:58|[Tang Chan] then smiled and took a few steps back, turning into the bathroom. In front of the mirror, she let down her hair and then took off her clothes. On the bed, [Ou Jian] seemed to sober up a bit, raising his head to look at the hotel room in front of him, and then at [Tang Chan]. He then covered his eyes with his hand in front of his forehead.
0:52:59|0:53:20|[Tang Chan], who had changed into a bathrobe, walked over and sat in front of him, reaching out to unbutton his shirt. [Ou Jian] just stared blankly at [Tang Chan], then looked down at his hand on his chest without saying a word. Then, he took out a condom to tear it open, but was stopped by [Ou Jian] raising his hand and slapping it away.
0:53:20|0:53:23|[Tang Chan] looked at him blankly, and he explained with a smile.
0:53:39|0:53:52|[Ou Jian] patted his chest, while [Tang Chen] smiled and took off the hair clip. Then she reached out to sweep her hair back, and then threw herself into [Ou Jian]'s arms by the bed, kissing his cheek affectionately and caressing his waist.
0:53:52|0:54:2|Slowly, he kissed [Qu Jian], under the night sky, amidst the lights, fireworks were set off. The two inside the house must have had a passionate night, as the scene gradually darkened.
0:54:3|0:54:19|After a night, [Qu Jian]'s coat was lying on the hotel bed. He woke up naked, sat up, and rubbed his temples due to a hangover. With half-opened eyes, he glanced around the room before turning his gaze to the window.
0:54:31|0:54:42|[Ou Jian] opened the door of room 1017 from inside. Before he could close the door, a man wearing a hat and a mask, pushing a cleaning cart, was approaching from a distance.
0:54:45|0:55:5|The man nodded and quickly walked into room 1017, closing the door behind him. Once inside, he took a camera out of the cleaning cart, looked around, and started shooting everywhere in the room. [Ou Jian] then went to the front desk in the lobby.
0:55:19|0:55:31|[Ou Jian] returned to that floor and ran towards 1017. The door of 1017 was wide open. After he went in and looked around, a female cleaner asked.
0:55:43|0:55:51|At this moment, at the back door of the hotel building, [Qiu Le], who has changed back into his own clothes, walks out with a camera in hand. He opens the car door and says to [Fei Xin].
0:56:6|0:56:8|[Ou Jian] arrived at a clothing store.
0:56:16|0:56:23|She stood with her hands behind her back, looking at the clothes displayed in the shop. At this moment, [Shen Jiamei] walked out from inside, and both of them smiled.
0:56:24|0:56:31|[Shen Jiamei] walked up to her, followed by a little boy behind her. Ou Jian looked at the little boy.
0:56:40|0:56:57|Outside the clothing store on the street, [Qiu Le] stops the car, [Fei Xin] takes photos with a camera, and [Qiu Le] raises a telescope to look. Inside the store, [Shen Jiamei] measures [Qu Jian] as if hugging him from behind after coming out of the fitting room, steps back after pulling the tape measure, and looks at the tape measure.
0:57:14|0:57:17|Qu Jian thought for a moment, then leaned over slightly and said.
0:57:18|0:57:34|Shen Jiamei blinked, lowered her head, took a measuring tape and walked up to Qu Jian, wrapping it around his neck. Qu Jian slightly lowered his head, the two of them facing each other very closely, and Shen Jiamei spoke again.
0:57:46|0:57:50|[Shen Jiamei] went to measure the size of her arms again. When she heard what Qiu Le said, she pursed her lips.
0:57:53|0:58:2|Jiamei didn't look up, Fei Xin's eyes flickered slightly, Jiamei looked at him, waiting for his answer. Fei Xin first avoided eye contact, then looked at Jiamei and said.
0:58:32|0:58:42|They were unaware that not far away, [Tesla] was also holding a camera filming the actions of the two in the store. Back at home, [Qiu Le] said to [Fei Xin] who was picking up balls on the table.
0:58:47|0:58:49|She is [Ou Jian]'s ex-wife.
0:59:13|0:59:30|The lower half of the face of the speaking [Tesla] is almost identical to [Qiu Le]. He pushed the photos to the man, who looked through them one by one. The man felt a pang of sadness and took a deep breath, while the [Tesla] across from him took a sip of coffee and revealed a barely noticeable smile.
0:59:30|0:59:36|The scene shifts to [Shen Jiamei]'s home, where she is also sitting at a table looking through photos. Her phone vibrates, and she picks it up to answer.
0:59:44|0:59:58|The man who previously drove [Shen Jiamei] into the living room, poured a glass of water and walked behind [Shen Jiamei], saw a photo on the table with [Shen Jiamei], [Qiu Le], and [Fei Xin].
1:0:13|1:0:25|[Jiamei]'s husband casually picked up an apple from the fruit plate, took a bite as he walked, and glanced back at [Jiamei]. Once back in the bedroom, she put on a suit jacket first, then turned to the mirror to adjust her collar.
1:0:26|1:0:34|Squatting on the ground, Fei Xin unzipped a large bag and put the gun in his hand inside. The bag was already filled with all kinds of guns.
1:0:37|1:0:54|He zipped up his bag and walked out the door. The scene shifted to a restaurant with various slogans about bullwhips written on the glass. Inside, customers were scooping out freshly cooked dishes from the pot, toasting and chatting. The kitchen sent out a plate of bullwhips, and at a table, three pairs of chopsticks together dipped into the pot.
1:0:54|1:1:10|One of the hands belongs to Fei Xin's client, the Korean underworld boss. The woman under him saw him pick up the bullwhip and turn her head to the other side. The Korean boss took a bite of the bullwhip, and the black-clothed strong man beside him frowned, please enjoy.
1:1:28|1:1:37|One of the henchmen pointed at the Korean boss, and everyone at the table looked over.
1:1:46|1:1:52|As the voice fell, several henchmen stood up in a row. However, the Korean boss reached out his hand and gestured for everyone to sit down.
1:1:58|1:2:16|Fei Xin's husband, Du Ge, raised his glass and gestured towards the Korean table, smiling. The Korean table also raised their glasses, and both sides drank without saying a word. One person at Du Ge's table took off his jacket, revealing a short-sleeved shirt with "Du Ge Express" printed on it. It turns out they were going to play real-life CS.
1:2:16|1:2:37|The scene shifts to [Nan Fang]'s home, where he opens the door. [Nan Fang] reaches out to pull the door. He walks to the dining table to pour water, with [Shen Jiamei] standing there with a bright expression. She looks around and sees the wedding photo of [Nan Fang] and Qu Jian on the wall, her face suddenly changing.
1:2:39|1:2:50|At this moment, [Nan Fang] walked up to her, and they looked at the wedding photo together. Her originally smiling face turned towards her, very coldly, and asked her who was staring blankly at the wedding photo.
1:3:14|1:3:28|[Shen Jiamei] took out two bottles from the bag provided by Fei Xin. Nan Fang walked over with a serious expression and threw a stack of photos on the table. Supporting the table with one hand and holding a just-poured glass of water with the other, Nan Fang felt a slight sourness in her nose as she said to Shen Jiamei, who was looking at the photos.
1:4:28|1:4:31|The man splashed the water in his hand and shouted.
1:4:39|1:4:45|Jiamei wiped the water off with the back of her hand, took a deep breath, and said something to [Nan Fang].
1:4:49|1:4:54|After speaking, [Shen Jiamei] left towards the door, leaving [Nan Fang] standing in place, feeling both sad and angry.
1:4:54|1:5:7|[Nan Fang] watched as [Shen Jiamei] walked away, the veins on his neck bulging as he took deep breaths. Then, [Nan Fang] angrily overturned the water cup on the table, causing it to fall to the ground and spill water everywhere.
1:5:7|1:5:20|[Qu Jian] was sitting on a balcony by the sea at this moment, scrolling through pages and looking at various firearms. Meanwhile, [Fei Xin] was drinking coffee and monitoring [Qu Jian]'s browsing interface. [Qu Jian] highlighted a page and sent a message to the buyer, asking him:
1:5:26|1:5:34|[Fei Xin] The message popped up on the computer screen, he quickly put down his cup and replied. He added.
1:5:39|1:5:50|[Qu Jian] took a sip of the wine on the table, muttered a few words, and replied OK to the buyer. Seeing [Qu Jian] taking the bait, [Fei Xin] leaned back in his chair and took a sip of coffee.
1:5:50|1:6:1|The scene shifts, [Qu Jian] wearing sunglasses, holding a briefcase in one hand and an umbrella in the other, arrives at the entrance of an abandoned amusement park. Thick iron chains are wrapped around the gate of the amusement park.
1:6:4|1:6:19|He pushed the door open, there was no gap at all. Then he turned around, bent down to look at the lock on the door, gave it a pull, and a small section of the door opened. The sign at the door read, "Magician Sherman Barnum, will have you fooled in minutes."
1:6:19|1:6:26|Ou Jian turned around, glanced at the way he came, then bent down and slipped through the small door, walking towards the entrance of the amusement park.
1:6:27|1:6:46|There is an adult leading a child in front, while [Qu Jian] looks around. From above, you can see that they are under a viaduct, surrounded by many trees, an artificial lake, and some amusement facilities. [Qu Jian] passes by a roller coaster track. Just as he raises his wrist to wipe the sweat off his face, a noise comes from behind.
1:6:51|1:7:10|The high-speed roller coaster turned with the sharp laughter of children. Fei Xin got off and quickly turned his head, not noticing anything unusual, then looked around. Moving further in, a round railing entrance to a swing ride was covered in blood, with a warning that the facility was out of service, do not climb or enter.
1:7:11|1:7:31|[Ou Jian] found a performance hall and walked in. The rhombus-patterned wallpaper was still adorned with large playing cards. On the stage, a few people were performing, while adults and children sat below near the entrance, accompanied by an old lady. The performance on stage featured a girl holding a gun, being chased and played with by two companions.
1:7:33|1:7:54|The little boy took the gun and pointed it at his own head, the girl and the clown quickly waved their hands. Surprisingly, the little boy aimed the gun at [the clown], who raised his hands in fear and stepped back. At this moment, all three of them noticed [Qu Jian] in the audience. Then, the little boy pulled the trigger, but [the clown] caught the bullet with his hands.
1:7:55|1:8:11|The three of them happily jumped and spun around on the stage, the boy handed the gun to [Clown], and then ran off the stage with the girl. [Clown] then pointed the gun at [Qu Jian], who calmly raised the scattered wings in his hand, and [Clown] walked off the stage.
1:8:11|1:8:24|[Qu Jian] wanted to catch up with [Li Zong], but as he passed by the three people sitting, the child suddenly turned his head to look at him. The hall was decorated with various ribbons, and the tables and chairs were the kind of connected tables and chairs in a canteen, everything was filled with a strange atmosphere.
1:8:27|1:8:31|[Ou Jian] walked into a dressing room on the attic, where a boy's voice could be heard.
1:8:39|1:8:55|The round lights on the makeup mirror lit up, [Qu Jian] turned them on, [Fei Xin] walked in, looked at [Qu Jian], then smiled and walked to the side. He first placed the pistol he had just used on the table, then placed the customized box on top, took out a gun wrapped in paper from inside.
1:9:1|1:9:8|Ou Jian opened the packaged handgun and picked up the one used by the clown. Ou Jian grabbed the clown's arm, and the clown nodded.
1:9:26|1:9:33|Next, Ou Jian took out the prepared money from the briefcase. The clown took it, nodded, and turned to walk to the mirror.
1:9:48|1:9:52|Ou Jian took advantage of this time to exchange the positions of the two guns.
1:10:10|1:10:13|The scene cuts to the police station, Officer Chen pushes open the door.
1:10:25|1:10:41|The scene returns to Fei Xin's home, with photos of Nan Fang, Qu Jian, and Shen Jiamei on the wall. He is staring at a relationship chart of these people, pursing his lips. The doorbell rings, and he takes out his phone to check. He immediately walks downstairs and speaks to the already entered Officer Chen.
1:11:27|1:11:34|We went to the hotel, [Officer Chen] with his hands on his hips, tapping his chin, paused and said.
1:11:39|1:11:45|[Fei Xin] came to the hotel with a photo of Qiu Le, accompanied by Officer Chen and his subordinates.
1:11:53|1:11:58|The receptionist led him to the monitoring room, where [Fei Xin] frowned as he looked at the surveillance footage.
1:12:3|1:12:14|[Officer Chen] tilted up the corners of his mouth behind him, looking even more determined. The people coming in and out of the hotel, going up and down the elevator, were all captured on surveillance. And at this moment, he was walking in the parking lot carrying a large bag of firearms.
1:12:15|1:12:33|Beside a car, a crowbar was inserted into the gap of the car window, then the trunk was easily opened and the bag was thrown in before turning and leaving. Over at the hotel, [Fei Xin] held a screenshot from the surveillance footage, standing at the door of room 307, rubbing the lower half of his face with his hand.
1:12:33|1:12:44|In the parking lot, Qiu Le pushes a shopping cart over, opens the trunk, and is about to put things in when he notices an extra bag. He sets the things down, unzips the bag, revealing many firearms.
1:12:47|1:12:56|He quickly closed the trunk, scanned the surroundings with his eyes, then sat in the driver's seat, resting his hand against his lips, deep in thought.
1:13:27|1:13:42|Officer Chen turned around and looked at [Fei Xin], who was holding a photo and mimicking the person in the surveillance footage walking from the room to the elevator. Next, Officer Chen and the others set off in a car to find [Qiu Le]. On the road, a number of police cars passed by the main parking lot of [Qiu Le].
1:13:44|1:13:59|Two traffic police cars stopped on both sides of the intersection, signaling the approaching cars to stop, in order to ensure the police cars transporting the captured criminals to pass through the intersection quickly and smoothly. The police convoy arrived and quickly cordoned off the parking lot with a police line.
1:13:59|1:14:9|Three snipers arrived at the underground parking lot, took the elevator, and were met by Officer Chen and others wearing bulletproof vests by the roadside. One subordinate ran over with a tablet.
1:14:18|1:14:22|Police officers were stationed one after another, and pedestrians on the roadside stopped to watch the commotion.
1:14:36|1:14:52|The police in the parking lot slowly approached [Qiu Le]'s car, while the helicopter above captured the situation on the ground. Dozens of police officers were seen moving quickly in the parking lot, one after another, all holding guns and using cars as cover.
1:14:52|1:15:1|Two police officers approached the sides of the car, with one opening the door and the other holding a gun moving closer, only to find [Qiu Le]'s phone on the driver's seat.
1:15:2|1:15:5|And [Qiu Le] is in the hallway not far away.
1:15:46|1:15:51|[Fei Xin] walked out of [Nan Fang]'s house and was photographed several times by [Qu Jian] hiding in the bushes.
1:16:0|1:16:17|The scene shifts to a shooting range, where the target is moved to a far distance. After firing several shots, [Qiu Le] changes the magazine and continues shooting, leaving bullet holes in the bullseye. [Fei Xin] walks in, stands behind him, and takes off his earphones.
1:17:5|1:17:30|[Fei Xin] grabbed Qiu Le and turned the gun towards him. With a fierce swing, [Fei Xin] stared at Qiu Le who remained silent. After speaking, Qiu Le turned and left the shooting range. [Fei Xin] watched his back, opened his mouth, and finally just sighed, walking to the shooting window and pressing the button.
1:17:31|1:17:45|[Qiu Le] shot the board that moved over, leaned in to take a closer look, stuck his index finger in, only then did he realize that all he had just shot were food rings. It seemed like he thought of something, as he rubbed his chin with his hand.
1:17:57|1:18:4|Thinking back to the time at the coffee shop with [Qiu Le], there was a man who looked very similar to [Qiu Le], who had once brushed past me.
1:18:5|1:18:34|Fei Xin took a look back and saw Tesla hiding behind the corner. Thinking about this, Fei Xin took out his phone and sent the photo of the man selling guns in the hotel to the Korean boss. Upon receiving the message, the Korean boss opened the photo and Fei Xin leaned back, cursing in Korean.
1:18:37|1:18:55|[Qiu Le], leaving the shooting range, walked in the night alley, unaware that a Tesla with a hat was following closely behind. [Qiu Le] furrowed his brows slightly as the Tesla maintained a certain distance, and the two of them walked in a circle, passing through this moonlit alleyway.
1:18:55|1:19:4|Upon returning home, Hui Xin saw someone sitting on the sofa. He was stunned for a moment, then lifted the corners of his mouth and said.
1:19:19|1:19:36|[Fei Xin] walked up the stairs, feeling the dog on the stairs. In the moment of bending down and standing up, [Fei Xin] noticed a bottle of wine on the table next to the sofa. Just as she walked upstairs, [Qiu Le] turned his head to look, and at this moment, Tang Chan rushed in through the door and shouted.
1:19:38|1:19:43|[Fei Xin] ran downstairs, only to be slapped by Tang Chan as soon as she reached the bottom.
1:20:6|1:20:18|Tang Chan gave a fierce look at [Fei Xin], then turned and walked out the door. [Fei Xin] wrinkled her nose in confusion and ran out after him, but she didn't chase after Tang Chan. Instead, she went to the hospital.
1:20:18|1:20:32|She pushed open the door with sunglasses on, ignoring the waiting pregnant women's gaze. After adjusting her glasses, she walked into the obstetrician's office with her hands in her pockets. Inside, [Doctor] asked.
1:20:35|1:20:45|[Fei Xin] sat down, the doctor in front of him didn't even lift his head. Then he took off his cold glasses and put them on the table, stroking his chin, as if the surroundings were all magically forbidden.
1:22:27|1:22:30|[Doctor] stood up and walked over to him.
1:22:44|1:23:5|[Fei Xin] sat on the chair, turned his head up, and the [doctor] also followed by bowing his head. After the two made a kissing gesture, [Fei Xin] walked out of the office, and the [doctor] happily stood in place waving his arms. The scene shifted to a small path, with the Korean boss walking at the front, rubbing his stomach and speaking.
1:23:21|1:23:29|The Korean boss's phone vibrated, he took it out and saw the name Tesla. His subordinates gathered around as he flipped to the next photo.
1:23:33|1:23:40|The Korean boss pushed his men back the way they came. The scene shifts to [Fei Xin], who walks into his house and takes off his coat.
1:24:5|1:24:9|After treatment, [Fei Xin] finally gave birth to a son.
1:24:15|1:24:20|Until he had a daughter, he believed the child was not his.
1:25:16|1:25:23|It turns out that [Fei Xin] just put something in the drink and swirled it. He stared at [Fei Xin] with determination.
1:25:40|1:25:50|Tesla's eyes were already a bit unfocused, and his body swayed and fell to the ground. [Fei Xin] walked over, squatted down, and patted his arm.
1:25:58|1:26:20|Fei Xin's dog also barked at Tesla. In a flash, Fei Xin tied Tesla's wrists with a rope, and then tied his feet together. He then picked up his coat and left. The scene shifted to an underground garage, in front of a lit-up recognizer. Fei Xin focused his eyes ahead, then entered the password at the elevator entrance.
1:26:20|1:26:34|He pushed open the door, hands in his pockets, and walked step by step to the front of the car. The headlights came on in front of the car, and the satellite leaned against the car and walked towards the exit. Just after a turn, not long after the execution, he collided head-on with another car.
1:26:37|1:26:43|On the other side, [Qu Jian] reversed the car, then drove forward fiercely and crashed into it again.
1:26:43|1:27:0|Ou Jian's movements were swift and decisive, clearly well-prepared. [Fei Xin] fired two shots again, but Ou Jian suddenly reversed and retreated, preparing to move forward. This time, [Fei Xin] reacted quickly and stepped on the gas pedal, causing their cars to collide violently.
1:27:8|1:27:20|Ou Jian picked up a baseball bat, got out of the car and walked towards Fei Xin's car, smashing and poking at the windows.
1:27:48|1:28:6|After circling the car several times, Qiu Le hesitated, and the baseball bat in his hand fell to the ground. Just as Fei Xin took a breath, Qiu Le pulled out a gun from the car and aimed it at Fei Xin. Suddenly, a figure flew between them, reminding Qiu Le of the scene where the boy shot during the performance of "Wind and Rain".
1:28:6|1:28:14|However, this time, the playing cards on the wall were splattered with blood. [Fei Xin] looked down and saw [Qiu Le] clutching his chest, falling to the ground. He rushed over.
1:29:15|1:29:17|The flashback ends, [Qiu Le] sits up.
1:29:29|1:29:41|Xie Tianyou stole a gun from a Korean, setting a trap to lure you into committing a crime. [Fei Xin] patted Qiu Le on the shoulder, and the three of them returned to [Fei Xin]'s home.
1:29:46|1:30:0|[Fei Xin] pulled Qiu Le to the computer. With one hand on the table and the other on the chair, [Fei Xin] watched Qiu Le operate the keyboard. A dialog box popped up on the screen as he waited and said.
1:30:9|1:30:21|[Qiu Le] came down from the second floor and also leaned in. Ou Jian curved his finger and placed it in front of his lips, frowning. At that moment, his phone vibrated. He took it out and saw that it was a call from the junior minister of the engineering department.
1:30:31|1:30:34|Ou Jian quickly typed on the keyboard and then explained.
1:31:18|1:31:36|The scene shifts to a bridal show, with several big brothers at the front row clapping enthusiastically. On the stage, two models are showcasing wedding dresses. Following them are models in bikinis, dresses, and traditional Chinese-style wedding gowns taking turns to appear. The lights are flashing, creating a very lively atmosphere.
1:31:36|1:31:55|The big brother in the audience has been enthusiastically applauding, holding flowers in both hands and waving to the models. At this moment, [Qiu Le], who arrived at the scene, is hiding behind the curtain in the dressing room, secretly observing. [Shen Jiamei]'s husband and a little brother are sitting on the side, while [Shen Jiamei] walks up behind a model who is getting her makeup done.
1:32:2|1:32:4|[Shen Jiamei] heard the sound and turned to get her clothes.
1:32:7|1:32:17|Next, she returned with a headscarf to the model who was getting makeup done, and her husband walked over with two cell phones in his hand. The scene then shifted back to Fei Xin's home.
1:33:24|1:33:28|[Fei Xin] looked at the message from the inventor Tesla. Then he turned to the next page and saw Edison.
1:34:42|1:35:17|At the moment when Ou Jian pressed the Enter key, Qiu Le on site pulled the circuit breaker. Tesla looked at the phone in confusion, while Fei Xin and Ou Jian watched the countdown stop at three seconds and cheered. The two breathed a sigh of relief, but the people on site looked at the countdown interface on the phone with questions.
1:35:22|1:35:37|[Ou Jian]'s phone received a message, he picked it up and saw a video of [Nan Fang] and a child being kidnapped in the back seat of a car, [Nan Fang]'s hands were tied to the car's roof handle, the child was placed in a safety seat, the Tesla sent the video, [Ou Jian] answered.
1:37:13|1:37:22|Han Guo's men never come in. The scene shifts to [Ou Jian], who is driving a Tesla and talking on the phone.
1:37:43|1:37:45|Tesla responded on the other end.
1:37:58|1:38:14|[Fei Xin] was at home looking at the books on the bookshelf. He took down a book on complex thinking, flipped to a page, circled the title of the Barnum Effect, quickly glanced at it, then put his hand on his chin and thought for a moment before sitting down on a chair.
1:38:41|1:38:55|Tesla put away his phone and turned to leave. [Fei Xin] also picked up his phone and prepared to rush to the scene. The scene was chaotic at this moment. Tesla walked up to Han Guo's subordinate, who was stunned. However, he looked at Qiu Le and said.
1:38:57|1:39:2|The people on the scene were looking at two identical individuals.
1:39:7|1:39:19|Tesla reached out to block, and the two began to fight. On the other side, [Nan Fang] was still controlling the car to move forward, and he shook his head back in the car, suddenly waking up.
1:39:19|1:39:28|[Nan Fang] glanced at the child next to him, started struggling, looked at his bound wrists, then looked at the child, brought his mouth close, and used his teeth to untie the rope.
1:39:29|1:39:38|During the journey, the car was clearly out of control, swaying from side to side. After several attempts, Fei Xin finally broke free from the restraints.
1:39:38|1:39:56|He quickly leaned forward, gripping the steering wheel, but to no avail as the steering wheel had no response. Anxiously, he pushed the steering wheel, sat back in the rear seat, tears streaming down his face in frustration. Meanwhile, the two men were fighting on the scene, and Officer Chen arrived with his team.
1:40:8|1:40:18|Officer Chen saw [Qiu Le] and the Tesla in the middle, both looking at him without saying a word. Feeling a bit confused, Officer Chen glanced at his subordinates before turning back to speak.
1:40:22|1:40:41|The scene cuts back to [Nan Fang], who is attempting to remove the safety seat. At this moment, the car has already reached a speed of 90 kilometers per hour. Seeing that the car is getting closer to the overpass, he finally remembers to twist the release lever on the side of the car seat. He quickly takes off his jacket and puts it on the safety seat.
1:40:41|1:40:57|In a critical moment, he held onto the safety seat and jumped out of the car, rolling on the ground several times, and the car also plunged off the overpass. [Nan Fang]'s limbs were all scratched from the rolling, but he didn't care about that, instead he quickly checked on the child in the safety seat.
1:40:57|1:41:18|After opening the coat, the child was safe and sound. [Nan Fang] excitedly and with lingering fear touched the child's face. Then he held the child out and hugged him tightly, crying out in excitement. The man's face was dirty and covered in bruises. He sat on the overpass, holding the child and crying loudly to the sky.
1:41:18|1:41:26|The sky, just after the rain, gradually brightened. The out-of-control car under the overpass flipped over completely on the ground, and [Qu Jian] finally arrived by car.
1:41:27|1:41:37|He looked at the overturned car on the ground, stiffly opened the car door and got out, moving slowly towards it, his body swaying as if he could collapse at any moment.
1:41:37|1:41:52|Approaching the car, he suddenly stopped in his tracks, his breathing uncontrollable. He then slightly turned to the side and quickly walked to the side of the car, leaning against it for a moment. After that, he knelt down on the ground, exhaling heavily, tilting his head to the side.
1:41:55|1:42:10|The sorrowful emotions surged in his heart as he not only lost his wife, but also his child. After some mental preparation, he blinked his eyes, as if forcing himself to accept it, looked into the car, and softly called out a name he hadn't called for a long time.
1:43:6|1:43:18|He carefully touched the child. The two stood under the overpass, looking at the child in their arms. The sky had completely cleared up by now, with the sunlight shimmering.
1:43:19|1:43:29|Ou Jian firmly stopped [Nan Fang], who finally burst into tears in his arms. Both of them shed tears as the long-standing misunderstanding was finally resolved.
1:43:29|1:43:40|Just as they embraced and let go, [Fei Xin] and [Qiu Le] arrived by car. They got out of the car, looked at the scene of reconciliation across from them, and smiled leaning against the car.
1:43:40|1:44:2|[Fei Xin] rested his arm on [Qiu Le]'s shoulder, while [Qiu Le] raised an eyebrow. [Fei Xin] leaned in and tapped his head against [Qiu Le]'s, then clapped his hands on his thigh. As he turned his head, he caught sight of the cat perched on the electric bike by the roadside. [Fei Xin] walked over, with [Qiu Le] following behind.
1:44:25|1:44:40|The film ends here, thank you for watching. Stay tuned for a post-credits scene. We see Tesla blocked by Korean henchmen, the Korean boss gets out of the car, walks over, lowers his sunglasses, takes a look, and bursts into laughter.
1:44:40|1:44:54|Patting the belly of the Tesla, then taking out a razor and waving it twice, turning to look at [Fei Xin] leaning against the car, [Fei Xin] then thumbs up, the Korean boss with the knife shaved towards the eyebrow of the Tesla.
1:44:54|1:45:4|When he put down his hand, half of Tesla's eyebrows were shaved off. He leaned his arm on Tesla's shoulder, lowered his sunglasses, and looked at [Fei Xin], now both of them were missing eyebrows.
1:45:6|1:45:12|A week later, Fei Xin is playing table tennis at home with a life-size cardboard cutout of the Korean boss across from him, when he answers the phone.
1:45:28|1:45:36|[Fei Xin] nodded, only to see the Korean boss on the other side take off his sunglasses, his eyebrows finally growing out, which made [Fei Xin] smile.
1:46:47|1:47:2|The clown danced in the cheap graveyard, with the opera echoing in the clock tower.
