0:0:44|0:0:50|Suddenly, a rapid phone ringing is heard. [Xu Changchun] is busy organizing newspapers and the worker outside the door shouts to him.
0:2:30|0:2:38|The parents' argument escalated, and the daughter couldn't bear it any longer, storming out the door. The father stood outside the room, looking guilty, and let out a soft sigh towards his daughter.
0:2:56|0:3:12|In winter, thick snow covers the ground. [Xu Changchun] gets into a van and leaves home, where the house is in a mess with broken cups and clothes scattered all over the floor. His wife sits by the window, watching outside with tears in her eyes, filled with unwillingness, doubt, and grievances.
0:3:12|0:3:21|Xu Changchun thought of something sad, held it in his chest, turned around and put his hand on his forehead. His daughter walked slowly from outside the door and called out tentatively.
0:4:33|0:4:41|[Xu Changchun] came to the film reel station with the 300 yuan he had advanced from the factory. He looked at the neatly arranged film reels of the same size and was momentarily dazzled.
0:4:41|0:4:55|Finally, he stopped in front of a shelf and took away the films one by one. The startled cashier didn't have time to react before [Xu Changchun] had already taken out 200 yuan. Then, he went to the supermarket and put whatever he saw into the shopping cart.
0:4:55|0:5:8|He cleared the instant noodles from the shelves, grabbed a handful of rock sugar, and dug out the last hundred yuan in advance. The scene shifts to an empty van driving out.
0:5:16|0:5:21|Xu Changchun and his companions loaded the things in front of them onto the car one by one.
0:5:38|0:5:44|Everyone got on the car one by one, in high spirits. The car started slowly and drove forward in a snowy field.
0:6:4|0:6:13|The car slowly drove towards the mountains, the heavy snow covering the land like a blanket, creating a clean and pure scene. In the distance, the melodious chirping of birds could be heard from time to time.
0:6:13|0:6:28|The car drove on the mountain road, turning around bends and crossing small hills. The heavy snow covered the mountains and the road, causing the car to move slowly, leaving only tire tracks spreading in the mountains. Before long, the car had also gone far and disappeared.
0:6:29|0:6:42|The sound of the engine revving could be heard coming from the hilltop. A woman, wrapped up tightly, took off her helmet in the next second and looked towards the direction the car was heading. It turned out to be Xu Changchun's daughter, Qingqing.
0:6:42|0:6:53|Riding a motorcycle, she followed her father to the countryside. After a moment of contemplation, as if making up her mind, she put her helmet back on, twisted the throttle, and continued to ride forward under the gloomy sky.
0:6:53|0:7:12|The heavy snow covered the road layer by layer, the wind howled in the ears, even wearing thick cotton coats, it was still hard to resist the cold. The ground was wet and slippery, the speed of the motorcycle was not fast, but with every turn, the motorcycle still swayed. Following the tire tracks left behind lightly, Xu Changchun and Xu Qingqing searched all the way, the surroundings unusually quiet.
0:7:12|0:7:29|Only the roaring sound of a motorcycle engine can be heard as [Xu Changchun] continues to walk without any intention of stopping. On the snow-covered mountain road, only a van can be seen slowly swaying and moving. [Xu Qingqing] behind him also dares not to stop, closely following.
0:7:29|0:7:45|Only a sound of urgent brakes could be heard, at the end of the village below the mountain for her. [Xu Qingqing] stood on the mountain, overlooking the village below. Then she took off her helmet, sighed, knowing that she was getting closer to the truth.
0:8:28|0:8:33|On the other side, [Xu Qingqing] rode a motorcycle to Xingfatun.
0:8:37|0:8:49|Speak up, [Xu Changchun] left the village committee of Xingfatun, with the children peeking at the door looking curious. Soon after, a man walked out of the village committee, paused for a moment, and then walked in another direction.
0:8:49|0:9:6|After leaving the village committee, [Xu Changchun] immediately got busy. One person was seen slowly climbing up a tree while holding it, and another person climbed up the basketball hoop using a ladder, placing the small TV squarely on the hoop. The scene shifted, and the man tied the wooden rope to a tree, attracting many children.
0:9:11|0:9:21|[Xu Changchun] lays out a large fistful of thread on the ground, while his companion presses the wooden cloth line under a stone and pulls it tight, eyes fixed on the direction of the wooden cloth, making final adjustments.
0:12:33|0:12:43|Hearing the distant sounds of slaughter, [Xu Changchun] quickly opened the car door and hurried towards the comrade operating the machine gun.
0:15:23|0:15:38|Xu Qingqing rode her motorcycle leisurely back and forth.
0:16:5|0:16:11|The departing villager stood still in surprise, and Xu Qingqing felt the same. Xu Changchun said.
0:16:27|0:16:29|The companion immediately widened their eyes upon hearing this.
0:18:24|0:18:29|His spirit influences one generation, two generations, three generations.
0:18:44|0:18:48|More than thirty years later, China has undergone tremendous changes.
0:20:23|0:20:38|With a loud whistle, the train horn sounded from afar. [Xu Changchun] stood tall, raising his right thumb slowly and placing it next to his ear. This shot is a tribute to the trust of the villagers and to the old soldiers who have served the people.
0:20:38|0:20:43|The village chief in the distance was also moved by the scene, he picked up the microphone and shouted to the whole village.
0:21:59|0:22:11|Night falls, and the movie begins to play. At first, only a few people came, then it became a dozen, then dozens. Everyone sat together in silence, only the sound of the film reel spinning rapidly could be heard.
0:22:59|0:23:12|The scene shifts to indoors, with [Xu Qingqing] pacing back and forth in the room, clutching her fist to her chest, looking very upset. She keeps glancing towards the door as if waiting for something. Suddenly, the door opens and her daughter quietly returns.
0:24:46|0:24:57|As the music slowly fades away, the movie is coming to an end. On this cold winter night, everyone is immersed in the film, reluctant to leave, and some can even hear the quiet sobs of those who are moved.
0:27:12|0:27:39|The winding path was dark and yellow, with pedestrians heading towards the rising sun, continuing to their next destination. The next morning, the wife was busy in the kitchen, the aroma filling the air, and then she shouted loudly. Stars, stop in the Beijing kitchen, the mother had just finished stir-frying the vegetables.
0:27:48|0:27:51|[Xu Changchun] couldn't help but lower his head and sniff hard.
0:31:6|0:31:11|You, please, please, [Xu Qingqing] sternly stopped, and [Xu Changchun]'s face became increasingly ugly.
0:31:26|0:31:31|[Xu Qingqing] looked puzzled, [Xu Changchun] suddenly got up and left, his mother quietly scolded him.
0:32:29|0:32:50|In the blink of an eye, the bus had already reached the bottom of the hill. The van drove further and further away, while [Xu Qingqing] stood in the cold wind, covered in thick snow, unmoving. Later, [Xu Qingqing] shouted towards the van, but due to the distance, [Xu Changchun] inside the car couldn't hear at all.
0:32:52|0:33:1|He climbed up a hill with all his strength. [Xu Changchun]'s van happened to be driving below the slope. Looking at the van below the slope, Jin Qing waved his arms.
0:33:3|0:33:11|Jin Qing vigorously waved her arms, hoping Xu Changchun could see her from the hillside. Xu Changchun heard Xu Qingqing's voice and poked his head out.
0:33:17|0:33:35|Watching [Xu Qingqing] on the hillside, [Xu Changchun] reached out of the window and waved in response. The bus drove further away, and [Xu Qingqing] on the hillside watched her departing father quietly sobbing. At this moment, she felt nothing but endless guilt towards [Xu Changchun].
0:33:46|0:34:4|The scene shifts, and the van finally slows down at the side of the road. The sign by the road reads "To the restaurant, the children go up the mountain." [Xu Changchun] and his comrades get off the van together, taking out the projection equipment from the vehicle. To protect the equipment, they carry all these bags on their shoulders.
0:34:4|0:34:8|The heavy equipment hung on the body, unconsciously emitting sighs.
0:34:36|0:34:40|In the desolate mountains, only a few figures of [Xu Changchun] are seen moving slowly.
0:35:31|0:35:47|Liu Shijun stood still in shock after hearing this, then his expression became even more alarmed as he walked towards [Xu Changchun]. He picked up the box in [Xu Changchun]'s hand, with other equipment hidden on his shoulder, and continued walking forward without looking back.
0:35:47|0:36:3|The cold winter wind is bone-chilling, with a desolate and barren landscape. Thick snow covers the plain, and [Xu Changchun] and three others are wearing military coats, carrying various projection equipment on their shoulders and in their hands. The snow has covered the original grassland, and with one step, they sink directly up to their calves.
0:36:3|0:36:21|[Xu Changchun] and his companions walked slowly step by step through the thick snow, even when they fell, they would try to get up. They helped each other, brushed off the snow on their bodies, and continued to move forward. The sun rose slowly, and they carried heavy equipment, not knowing how long they had been walking.
0:36:21|0:36:28|The continuous walking made several people sweat profusely. They carried large and small bags, climbing over small hills one after another.
0:36:28|0:36:45|The speed may not be fast, but the footsteps are continuous. On another hill, [Xu Changchun] stops and looks into the distance. The long walk has left him somewhat exhausted, and the snow is getting deeper, covering his knees directly. Every step is a significant test of his physical endurance.
0:37:12|0:37:18|The old grandfather in the village stood on a watchtower made of tree branches, occasionally looking into the distance with a telescope. 
0:37:37|0:37:44|In the golden hour, the gentle sunlight slanted down, and [Xu Changchun] and his group hurriedly walked through the courtyard carrying the projection equipment.
0:38:5|0:38:14|The sun silently set behind the mountains, and [Xu Changchun] and his companions sat around the campfire.
0:38:44|0:38:52|Everyone's faces were beaming with smiles, and [Xu Changchun] and the others started drinking the ginseng soup heartily. In no time, the old man entered the room carrying a sumptuous meal.
0:39:34|0:39:55|The warmth of the villagers touched [Xu Changchun], and his damp shoes also became warm in the cozy room. As night fell, with only the grandfather and grandson in the yard, [Xu Changchun] still made every effort to set up the bathing facilities. Despite the unusually cold night, the grandfather kept urging Mubu to open up.
0:40:43|0:40:57|Suddenly, a strong wind blew, causing the tree to sway. Liu Shijun quickly ran towards the tree and climbed up, grabbing the rope above Mu Bu. [Xu Changchun] shouted in concern.
0:43:3|0:43:6|Grandpa saw his grandson laughing happily and bumped him with his arm.
0:43:51|0:44:2|Liu Shijun ran towards [Xu Changchun], but [Xu Changchun] insisted on grabbing the rope himself. Liu Shijun had no choice but to grab the edge of the curtain with all his strength to reduce the pressure on [Xu Changchun]. The old man looked at the two in front of him, tears welling up in his eyes.
0:44:56|0:44:58|[Xu Changchun] quickly turned back towards the ocean.
0:45:13|0:45:18|Dongye couldn't help but reach out, and a few people used flashlights to see the items in the box.
0:47:51|0:47:57|When they descended the mountain, the east had already turned white.
0:48:8|0:48:21|In the printing factory, [Xu Changchun] hung up the phone decisively with a firm tone, and sat on a chair with a worried look on his face.
0:49:55|0:49:57|Xu Qingqing just left when the phone rang again.
0:50:30|0:50:48|[Xu Changchun] hung up the phone with joy, the wrinkles on his face filled with a smile. He slowly got up, pacing back and forth in the office, happily supplying his brother. Suddenly, his right leg seemed to be hit, and the next second he showed pain. [Xu Changchun] held his right leg, slowly running towards the sofa behind him.
0:50:48|0:50:52|After sitting down slowly, [Xu Changchun] gently tapped his right leg with his right hand to relieve the pain.
0:51:32|0:51:35|The wife wrapped the medicine package and protected it on [Xu Changchun]'s leg.
0:52:50|0:52:52|His wife interrupted him, creating a somewhat awkward atmosphere.
0:53:1|0:53:6|After a brief exchange of pleasantries, the wife bid farewell to Zhou Yumei, with [Xu Changchun] silently following behind.
0:54:10|0:54:15|[Xu Changchun] pushed away his wife's hand and slowly got up. His wife quickly supported him and then spoke.
0:54:37|0:54:57|[Xu Changchun] hesitated to speak, just sighed, the scene shifted, the train with a loud rumble, speeding away, passing through rows of trees and towns, lakes and forests. In a certain carriage, dressed lightly in a police uniform, looking refreshed, he gazed ahead, his eyes occasionally vacant.
0:55:36|0:55:43|[Xu Changchun] and his comrades trudged through the heavy snow, crossed the suspension bridge, faced continuous challenges along the way, but they all overcame them to screen a movie for the villagers.
0:55:54|0:56:12|With the sound of the train whistle, carriages one after another rushed towards the platform in the cold wind. The deafening sound of the machines enveloped the forest, and the wind blowing out from under the train made the trees swirl. Late at night, walking alone on the street, suddenly heard the distant honking of a car.
0:56:12|0:56:22|A van was seen parked directly in front of Xu Changchun's printing factory. Soon, several people got out of the car, it was Xu Changchun and his comrades.
0:56:38|0:56:52|[Xu Changchun] stared straight at [Xu Qingqing] in front of him. [Xu Qingqing] took the initiative to speak. [Xu Qingqing] pouted like a child who had done something wrong. [Xu Changchun] had a gentle look in his eyes, with a hint of a smile on his lips, slowly walking towards [Xu Qingqing].
0:58:22|0:58:25|A young girl holding a team flag shouted loudly.
0:58:44|0:58:53|The patriotic and affectionate Xu Changchun clearly sees the red and green flag fluttering in the sky.
0:59:32|0:59:41|There is no hypocrisy, no exaggeration, every detail is impeccable honesty and truth.
1:1:5|1:1:16|A military discipline officer brought a brand new computer to the table in front of them. Villagers, children, everyone had happy smiles on their faces. Just then, a truck loaded with goods woke up at the school gate.
1:1:21|1:1:24|Li, a villager, gets out of the car and walks straight into the school.
1:2:46|1:3:2|Xu Changchun set up the projection equipment, and the villagers in the whole village sat neatly on the snow-covered playground. In the empty playground, only the sound of the videotape and the echo of the movie could be heard. At this moment, the movie "Going to School with Dad on My Back" appeared on the screen.
1:3:3|1:3:15|The movie slowly begins, occasionally hearing the sparse discussions of villagers. The elementary school students sitting in the front rows, dressed in neat school uniforms and red scarves, eagerly watch the movie playing in front of them.
1:4:3|1:4:9|The little boy in the movie looked at his father lying on the ground, feeling guilty, he opened his mouth but couldn't make a sound.
1:4:20|1:4:39|Sad music starts playing, as everyone watches this touching scene, it also moves the hearts of the villagers. Everyone frowns, with tears in their eyes, even the young men in the village are touched by the boy's words. A primary school student is completely immersed in the emotions of the movie, with swollen eyes fixed on the screen.
1:4:39|1:4:53|Suddenly, a few tears rolled down her cheeks, and she quickly wiped them away, leaving traces of tears on her innocent and tender face. The scene shifted to a late night, with [Zhou Yunmei] swaying back and forth as she rode her bicycle.
1:4:53|1:5:4|She gasped for breath, her eyes struggling to stay open as she looked at the road ahead. She kept coughing along the way, even making a retching sound. The night was extremely painful, on a winter night, the road was dark and slippery.
1:5:5|1:5:26|[Zhou Yumei] rode her bicycle along the road and absentmindedly entered [Xu Changchun]'s neighborhood. Without paying attention, [Zhou Yumei] flipped over on her bike and fell to the side of the road. As she slowly got up, she looked bewildered.
1:5:52|1:6:3|[Zhou Yumei] unzipped her jacket and took out a neatly folded piece of paper from the pocket inside. With a smile on her face, she unfolded the paper in a daze. At that moment, [Xu Changchun]'s wife approached with a glass of water.
1:6:28|1:6:38|Zhou Yumei, in a drunken state, just tried to sit up when the next second she fell back. She leaned against the sofa, with her eyes closed but a smile on her face.
1:6:58|1:7:15|The scene shifts to a restaurant where [Xu Changchun] and his group are sitting together. He is pouring drinks for everyone one by one, while the others sit in silence with solemn expressions. Everyone is burdened with heavy thoughts, unwilling to speak first, looking at each other with confusion.
1:7:37|1:7:40|The atmosphere became even more tense, and [Xu Changchun] spoke again.
1:7:48|1:7:58|After raising their glasses and toasting each other, they all drank in unison. [Xu Changchun] finished first, then picked up the bottle to refill his glass, and began to speak.
1:8:20|1:8:25|[Xu Changchun] looked at the embarrassed Zhu Guangxu, reached out his hand to signal him not to say more, and sighed.
1:8:45|1:9:0|The atmosphere became extremely tense, everyone looked at each other, not knowing how to speak. They could only forcefully shovel the food in front of them into their mouths, occasionally accompanied by the sound of heavy breathing. [Xu Changchun] wanted to speak to Zhu Guangxu in front of him, but held back.
1:10:52|1:11:9|[Xu Changchun] turned around, looking angrily at [Xu Qingqing], wanting to speak but hesitating. Qingqing widened her eyes, pursed her lips, and looked at [Xu Changchun] with a righteous attitude. [Xu Changchun] sighed, turned around, and walked out of the office. Dad's temper is getting weirder, he seems very repressed.
1:13:55|1:14:13|The scene shifts to a snowy mountain road, where only the sound of the car driving can be heard quietly. Riding a motorcycle gently at the front, [Xu Changchun] is followed closely by two vans. Inside the vans, Zhou Yumei is tightly holding Liu Shijun, happily looking at the scenery outside, eagerly anticipating this journey.
1:14:13|1:14:19|In another car, [Xu Changchun] leaned on his wife's shoulder with his eyes closed, and his wife nudged him with her head and asked.
1:14:35|1:14:40|[Xu Changchun] sat up, looking at his wife in astonishment as she spoke again.
1:14:52|1:15:7|Saying that, [Xu Changchun] excitedly saluted his wife. His wife, seeing his gesture, was truly surprised, then reached out and held his hand. At that moment, all emotions surged up, hot tears swirling in their eyes.
1:15:7|1:15:27|He tightly held Xu Changchun's hand, with the winter sun shining down warmly on the flat snowy ground like layers of green sand. The team arrived at a fork in the road in the mountains, slowing down and continuing in different directions. On New Year's Eve, the village was particularly lively, with every household hanging up big lanterns and pasting couplets.
1:15:27|1:15:33|The sound of firecrackers was continuous, everyone covered their ears, and both adults and children had happy smiles on their faces.
1:15:45|1:16:1|The film starts with four big characters on the screen, "Don't leave until you see it." Both adults and children are staring at the movie being shown in front of them, all with great interest, not saying a word. No one dares to make a sound, quietly waiting for the movie to begin.
1:16:1|1:16:6|The next moment, the movie officially begins, and everyone becomes excited, whispering to each other.
1:16:7|1:16:25|Inside the fence, people were packed tightly, one after another, with hardly any room to move their feet. Outside the fence, it was even more crowded, with people squeezed in so tightly that there were three layers inside and three layers outside.
1:17:27|1:17:33|At night, the snow-covered mountains were deserted, with only the gentle sound of a motorcycle echoing through the valley.
1:18:30|1:18:34|The movie started slowly, and the villagers gradually quieted down.
1:19:6|1:19:15|Here, [Xu Qingqing] is riding a motorcycle back non-stop. Tonight, the village is particularly lively, with the sound of movies and fireworks filling the air.
1:19:25|1:19:43|The videotape was playing with a rustling sound. [Xu Changchun] anxiously opened it to check, as it was about to finish playing but [Xu Qingqing] had not arrived yet. Meanwhile, in the cold mountains, the wind howled like a green arrow dancing in the night sky, making sharp noises. [Xu Qingqing] struggled against the wind to move forward. On the other side, [Xu Changchun] couldn't wait any longer.
1:19:50|1:20:12|At a turn, the road was too slippery, causing the motorcycle to fall down with a light touch. Due to the cold weather, the motorcycle unexpectedly stalled. [Xu Qingqing] struggled to get up, but despite her efforts to lift the motorcycle, she couldn't move it at all.
1:20:12|1:20:24|On the other side, [Xu Changchun] anxiously flashed a flashlight and hurriedly walked out of the village. [Xu Qingqing] exerted all her strength, but the motorcycle remained motionless. She looked into the distance, then glanced at her watch, making a decision in her heart.
1:20:24|1:20:37|She gritted her teeth, then decisively stood up and walked quickly towards the village where [Xu Changchun] was. On this side, [Xu Changchun] was carrying a flashlight with a videotape, wanting to find [Xu Qingqing] as soon as possible and hand over the videotape to her.
1:21:11|1:21:15|[Xu Changchun] fell to the ground, and [Xu Qingqing] quickly ran over to help him up.
1:22:26|1:22:36|Jingjing carried the heavy videotape on her shoulder and walked forward. Xu Changchun was walking in the snow behind her, while Jingjing turned around with tears in her eyes and shouted.
1:22:42|1:22:46|Qingqing's face was full of tears as she took two steps back and looked back at [Xu Changchun] with reluctance.
1:22:52|1:23:5|Softly finishing the last sentence, [Xu Changchun] walked forward without looking back. The cold was eroding Xu Changchun standing in the snow, and after an unknown period of time, a van broke through the darkness of the mountains and slowly drove towards him against the cold wind.
1:23:5|1:23:16|[Xu Changchun]'s legs were covered with snow, and he tried to move them to keep them warm, while the cold wind made a piercing sound. His wife and the village chief on the van saw [Xu Changchun] blocking the road and quickly got off the car.
1:23:46|1:23:51|The van slowly drove away, the wind getting stronger. The village chief helped Xu Changchun to quickly tidy up.
1:24:23|1:24:38|The scene shifts to a mountain village nursing home, which, though small, is very cozy. In the center, there is a hexagonal pavilion for the elderly to rest. Tonight is very special, in the empty courtyard, a group of elderly people sit neatly watching a movie, each with a big smile on their face.
1:24:38|1:24:47|Most of them were covered in white hair, their eyes squinted into a slit, shining with a radiant smile from [Xu Qingqing]. That night, to everyone's surprise, Dad miraculously stood up.
1:24:56|1:25:6|Uncle Liu and the others moved from Huashugou to Hutouling. My father, mother, Uncle Liang, and I arrived at the mountain village nursing home.
1:25:8|1:25:25|In the early morning, the village was particularly lively, with every household setting off firecrackers to celebrate the new year. The firecrackers popped and crackled, spreading beautiful wings in the sky. At dusk, heavy snow covered all the trees and grass, with the sunlight shining down as if draping a thin layer of green on the earth.
1:25:26|1:25:45|The strong wind blew wildly, chilling to the bone. The bare trees stood in the cold wind, interacting with their branches and leaves. The scene shifted, and the heavy snow covered the mountains like a thick blanket. The [Xu Changchun] film projection team started their journey again. Two days later, six more old soldiers joined Dad and the others.
1:25:45|1:25:58|A month later, it was rumored that more than a dozen voluntary film projection teams had emerged. Another year later, who knows how many unexpected things will happen again.
