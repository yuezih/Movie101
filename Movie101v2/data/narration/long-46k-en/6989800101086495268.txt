0:2:1|0:2:27|Colonel Cyclops stood displeased, got up and walked to the ear of Sergeant Yang Zhong, whispering quietly. The colonel stepped forward slowly in his leather boots, taking only a few steps before reaching the female spy. He lifted the leather glove on his hand, teasing her chin and said meaningfully to the soldier with a big beard.
0:2:48|0:3:2|The noblewoman, disregarding her glamorous gown, threw herself at Colonel's feet, clutching his legs and pleading. The Colonel gently helped her up, kissing the back of her hand.
0:4:30|0:4:37|Calming her discontent, he slowly approached the female special agent, [Yang Zhong].
0:4:59|0:5:17|Sergeant took out a handkerchief to wipe the saliva sprayed on Colonel's face, the female spy in the dungeon was carving words on the wall, the prison door was opened, a female soldier walked in with dinner, the female soldier watched Hans walk away, and approached him whispering,
0:5:28|0:5:45|The female spy decisively threw the tray, the loyal spy's mouth was bleeding as she turned away, leaving the female soldier looking helplessly towards the door. At that moment, the sergeant was drinking with the jailer, so he approached the female spy and said,
0:5:47|0:5:53|The female spy sneered at the female soldier disdainfully.
0:6:7|0:6:25|She said with a straight face and a righteous expression, tears welling up in her eyes as she held the female soldier's hand and said,
0:6:41|0:6:51|The female soldier reached for the key on her waist, craning her neck to look at the soldiers outside the cell. Just as she was about to unlock it, the cell door was opened.
0:7:30|0:7:44|The female soldier greeted with a shout, and the group rushed in the direction pointed by the soldier. The sturdy iron gate was opened, and leading the way was Sergeant Yang Zhong. He waved inside, and the female soldier helped the female spy out. This could be considered as an escape.
0:8:38|0:8:45|After speaking, the female spy returned to the prison cell, leaving the three of them helplessly facing each other.
0:9:20|0:9:44|[Yang Zhong] gently throws the paper airplane in his hand, it soars through the sky and lands on a billboard, revealing the title: "Personal Tailor". It bids farewell to a young woman from Shaanxi who is eager to experience the life of a martyr. Next, he will face the master [Driver] who wants to be an honest official but willingly accepts money and seduction, the globally most vulgar director who aspires to pursue elegance while cutting ties with the common, and the birthday wish of the river cleaner who wants to become wealthy, [Sister Dan].
0:9:45|0:9:58|Dream seekers come one after another, and the Dream Team racks their brains to tailor dream solutions for each client. Along the way, many hilarious and absurd incidents occur, but in the end, every client's dream comes true.
0:9:58|0:10:11|The film is a collaboration between Director Feng Xiaogang and Wang Shuo, following the success of "If You Are the One 2". The film's creation was inspired by Director Feng Xiaogang's prolonged period of melancholy and depression during the preparation for "1942".
0:10:12|0:10:29|After the screening, Feng Xiaogang sighed and said that the process of filming "1942" was too exhausting. Therefore, he especially wanted to make a film that would make people laugh from beginning to end, a carefree movie that would be more enjoyable to shoot. The online reviews of the film were mixed, but it still achieved impressive box office results.
0:10:29|0:10:45|Achievement. On the beautiful Hainan Island, the sea breeze blows over the calm sea, and under the coconut trees, flowers bloom. In this semi-circular reception hall, a man and a woman walk in, it is the plain-clothed [Driver] and the professionally dressed [Xiao Bai], the two sit facing each other.
0:11:55|0:12:2|Seeing no response from [Xiao Bai], Yang Zhong couldn't help but mutter to himself.
0:12:37|0:12:50|The driver's dream of becoming an honest official was quickly put on the agenda, and the private custom-made group was busy selecting addresses and making plans. Finally, the day arrived.
0:13:30|0:13:47|[Xiao Bai] helped him put on a Zhongshan suit, straightened his collar, and brought a pair of glasses for him to wear. [Driver] adjusted the glasses for him, instantly giving him a leader-like aura. He walked quickly towards the small sofa, sat down with a thud, propped his hands on the armrests, and leaned back triumphantly.
0:14:31|0:14:58|The driver picked up the tea cup and blew gently, looking at the two people. Xiao Bai's smile gradually disappeared. In the elegant garden, the trees, rockeries, and pavilions exuded a harmonious atmosphere. Everyone accompanied the leader and walked along, watching the embroidered girls on the corridor. He nodded secretly, the boats on the river braving the wind and waves. Xiao Bai held an umbrella for him, while Ma Qing introduced the layout around him.
0:14:58|0:15:16|In the temple, the towering Bodhisattva statue is eye-catching, with a golden body holding a jade purification bottle in one hand and twisting a willow branch in the other. Walking under this golden figure from left to right are three people, dressed in a suit is [Ma Qing], pretending to be a leader is the [Driver], and on the far right in professional attire is [Xiao Bai].
0:15:16|0:15:28|Three people looked up at the huge Buddha statue, the sound of the bell rang out. [Yang Zhong] couldn't help but kneel down, the other two quickly pulled him up, helping him to slowly stand up.
0:15:44|0:15:53|Night falls on the city, with neon lights adorning the Suzhou Cultural and Arts Center, where a spectacular performance is taking place on stage.
0:15:53|0:16:20|In the audience seats below the stage, the leader sits in the middle wearing a shirt, with [Ma Qing] and [Xiao Bai] on either side. The pair of dancers on stage cooperate seamlessly, with outstanding dance moves. The leader below the stage watches with fascination, as strength and beauty, firmness and gentleness blend freely on the stage. The light dance is like a swallow floating in the tide, the auspicious moon is like a bird passing through the night, graceful and elegant with the wind, and the beautiful sleeves flutter like jade.
0:16:20|0:16:36|The next morning, in the villa surrounded by trees, [Ma Qing] carried a water bottle while [Xiao Bai] held a towel as they walked towards the office. Upon opening the door, they saw the leader sleeping on the desk. They put down what they were holding, and [Ma Qing] approached the leader.
0:17:7|0:17:16|She walked around to the leader, picked up a cup and took a sip of water. This time, she accidentally sprayed it onto the leader's face.
0:17:28|0:17:37|The leader said with a vague look in his eyes. The leader was already tired of such foreign affairs activities.
0:17:45|0:17:57|Ma Qing wiped his face and put on glasses for him. Director stopped, picked up another pair of glasses on the table, and said, reaching into the frame to pick up two pairs of glasses.
0:18:2|0:18:17|The Saudi VIP guests have arrived. The two playing the role of a foreign dignitary are [Yang Zhong] and Xiao Dong. Xiao Ma steps forward to guide them, their elegant exotic attire showcasing the noble air of Saudi Arabia. The group arrives at the office door.
0:18:32|0:19:0|[Leader] stared with wide eyes, took slow steps forward and approached [Yang Zhong], saying: [Yang Zhong] nodded gently, facing [Xiao Lu]. [Leader] changed his demeanor, displaying a friendly diplomatic etiquette. After taking a seat, [Leader] slowly picked up the teacup and took a sip.
0:19:6|0:19:17|After she translated randomly, the foreign guest still insisted on speaking in a gibberish manner. After some contemplation, [Director] said,
0:20:35|0:20:42|[Ma Qing] was also annoyed for the [leader], after speaking, he looked at the [leader] with a flattering face. The [leader] frowned and said:
0:21:56|0:22:11|[Leader] excitedly pats the armrest of the sofa, while [Secretary Ma] holds an umbrella on the tree-lined path, leading a rural couple towards [Leader]'s office. The couple is carrying and dragging a lot of things, and in front of the desk,
0:22:19|0:22:35|Upon seeing this scene, [Director] was stunned for a moment. [Secretary Ma] quickly stepped forward, leaving [Director] even more confused. [Director] then asked,
0:23:8|0:23:15|[Yang Zhong] takes off his shoes and sits on the sofa, [Xiao Bai] taps on an empty tea canister, while [Ma Qing] walks briskly over.
0:24:31|0:24:41|Third Aunt adjusted her posture and said earnestly:
0:24:57|0:25:5|The old man jumped onto another sofa chair and said:
0:25:9|0:25:15|Third Aunt took a look at the expressions of the two, hurried over to sit next to [Yang Zhong], and sat on the armrest of [Yang Zhong]'s sofa.
0:25:45|0:26:11|The old man walked out of the office with a beard and glaring eyes, followed by a woman who couldn't help shaking her head. When everyone left, [Yang Zhong] quickly got up, his hands searching through the agricultural products, trying to find evidence of bribery. He opened plastic bags and untied hemp bags, rummaging through a pile of agricultural products to find red envelopes. Just then, [Ma Qing] the secretary walked into the office holding tea leaves, and [Yang Zhong] had just grabbed a handful of millet.
0:26:13|0:26:32|The secretary [Ma Qing], who was bustling about, happened to witness this scene, while [Yang Zhong] stiffened his body. The secretary [Ma Qing] casually put down the tea canister and walked up in surprise, while [Yang Zhong] also grabbed a handful of peanuts, slowly stood up, and looked angrily at the secretary [Ma Qing] as the rain poured outside the window.
0:26:41|0:26:59|[Yang Zhong] angrily interrogated [Ma Qing]'s secretary, who tried to change the subject. [Yang Zhong] raised the peanuts in his hand and angrily threw them at [Ma Qing]'s secretary.
0:26:59|0:27:13|That day, a luxury red flag car drove through the garden-like streets, with [Ma Qing] the secretary and [Yang Zhong] inside. As a round of enthusiastic applause rang out, the car slowly pulled up to a teahouse, with hostesses and security personnel standing on both sides.
0:27:13|0:27:25|As they arrived at the door, the car stopped. [Ma Qing], the secretary, got out of the car first, and the receptionist at the teahouse approached to open the car door for [Yang Zhong].
0:29:23|0:29:34|[Ma Qing] secretary took the phone and found a good position, with the etiquette ladies lined up on both sides. The secretary of [Ma Qing] stepped forward and whispered a reminder.
0:30:1|0:30:8|[Yang Zhong] suddenly stopped and looked at the hanging painting, pointing at it with a fan.
0:30:50|0:30:57|[Yang Zhong] looked at the fully prepared drinks, and the wine steward quickly poured the wine.
0:33:0|0:33:12|The leader opened the box and found it full of cash. He closed the box and looked displeasedly at [Xiao Bai] and [Yang Zhong], who avoided his gaze, not daring to meet his eyes.
0:33:27|0:33:44|The leader held the mooncake box with a folding fan, [Xiao Bai] glanced at [Yang Zhong] briefly.
0:35:33|0:35:40|[Yang Zhong] was unusually excited and thrilled.
0:36:7|0:36:14|The leader suddenly changed his attitude, catching everyone off guard.
0:36:27|0:36:31|Leader opened the mooncake box, grabbed a hundred yuan bill and threw it.
0:36:38|0:36:45|The leader, still full of resentment, picked up another stack of banknotes,
0:37:13|0:37:18|A box of hundred yuan bills was thrown away, the leader left his glasses on the table, and [Ma Qing] walked over.
0:37:25|0:37:29|The leader picked up the white wine on the table and poured it into his mouth.
0:37:40|0:37:58|He said with lingering regret, the enraged leader erupted with dissatisfaction over his experiences at this moment, and at this moment he covered his face and cried as sadly as a child, I think I'm in trouble.
0:38:58|0:39:5|He suddenly paused and asked in disbelief, "[Ma Qing], with a puzzled look on his face,"
0:39:20|0:39:26|In front of the mirror in the hotel, [Xiao Lu] is holding a hair tie in her mouth and tying her hair. She questions [Yang Zhong] standing beside her.
0:40:1|0:40:6|[Yang Zhong] looked deeply into her beautiful eyes, gently took her hand, and said
0:40:14|0:40:40|And [Yang Zhong] placed her hand back on her chest, while [Xiao Lu] looked devoutly and said to fulfill others: [Yang Zhong] left behind her floral swimsuit and walked away. At night in the indoor swimming pool, the leader was practicing breaststroke with goggles on. As he was about to get out of the pool, he saw a pair of legs faintly visible. When he looked up, he saw a pair of smooth and slender legs in high heels. Following the legs up, he saw [Xiao Lu] dressed in a sexy outfit.
0:41:14|0:41:39|[Xiao Lu] appropriately draped the leader with a bath towel, the leader sat on the lounge chair, [Xiao Lu] disinfected his fingertips, the leader shook off the water on his face, [Xiao Lu] then squatted in front of the leader, took out a needle from the nearby iron plate to draw blood, only to see fresh blood slowly flowing out, the leader looked down at [Xiao Lu]'s well-proportioned figure, [Xiao Lu] spread the blood on the blood pressure monitor.
0:42:7|0:42:23|The leader took out his fingers and said with a smile: [Xiao Lu] smiled, revealing two dimples.
0:43:34|0:43:51|The leader slowly reached out his hand, with [Xiao Lu] holding his palm with both hands. [Xiao Lu] smiled and pointed to the leader's palm as she turned her body.
0:44:17|0:44:26|[Xiao Lu] stared with wide eyes in astonishment, while Leader froze upon hearing this, staring straight at the [Xiao Lu] in front of him, her curves accentuated by the tight swimsuit.
0:44:53|0:45:0|He took off his bathrobe and turned around, his jade-like fingers lightly tracing along his spine, creating an indescribably wonderful atmosphere.
0:45:16|0:45:21|The leader turned around, holding the delicate hand on his shoulder, and [Xiao Lu] shyly lowered her head.
0:45:40|0:45:47|The enraged leader frightened [Xiao Lu], tears swirling in her captivating eyes, she couldn't help but cover her mouth and cry.
0:46:10|0:46:19|With that, [Xiao Lu] rushed towards the pool and dove in.
0:46:47|0:46:57|Secretary Ma, who was secretly observing, strode towards the pool, where the leader in the water touched Xiao Lu's forehead.
0:47:20|0:47:33|[Yang Zhong] rushed over to cover [Xiao Bai]'s eyes, leaving [Xiao Lu] behind as they swam towards the shore.
0:48:23|0:48:28|When it comes to the emotional climax, his fingers wipe away tears through the empty eye sockets.
0:49:0|0:49:18|Sitting on the sofa, [Ma Qing] tried to hold back his laughter, while the others looked at each other in confusion. Finally, he stared at [Ma Qing] and said,
0:49:30|0:49:39|When [Ma Qing] heard this, he uncrossed his legs and stood up.
0:50:18|0:50:25|Walking to the window, [Yang Zhong] looked at the pouring rain outside, then turned and walked towards [Driver].
0:50:33|0:50:38|Yang Zhong approached and patted his shoulder, the Driver took off his glasses, and then removed his watch.
0:51:26|0:51:41|This daydream has also been successfully completed, and the private custom-made group is facing new challenges. Here, [Yang Zhong] drives a car carrying the radiant group to a new place, where a display stand is filled with golden trophies. [Director] picks up one of them and says,
0:51:45|0:51:52|[Yang Zhong] carefully examined the trophy he was holding, while the [Director] walked towards another trophy, with [Xiao Lu] and [Yang Zhong] following to take a look.
0:52:52|0:52:58|The director took a resolute attitude and Yang Zhong said meaningfully, "
0:54:2|0:54:26|The director slapped his thigh in frustration, hoping that the two of them could come up with some clever ideas. [Yang Zhong] was the first to stand up and clink glasses with [Xiao Lu] and the director, while he turned his back and paced, trying to come up with a plan. As he took a few steps, his attention was drawn to an old photograph. He signaled to [Ma Qing] and [Xiao Bai], and as [Xiao Lu] set down her glass and looked towards [Yang Zhong], he placed his hand on the picture frame, determined.
0:54:41|0:54:50|[Ma Qing] knelt in front of the tombstone, crying in pain, while [Xiao Bai] stood aside recording with her phone.
0:55:51|0:55:57|Xiao Bai could only kneel helplessly in front of the tombstone, this time it was Ma Qing's turn to record the video.
0:56:57|0:57:5|[Ma Qing] on the opposite side was stunned for a moment, [Xiao Bai] hurriedly said. [Ma Qing] looked at [Xiao Bai], while [Xiao Bai] looked around at everyone. The expressions on the faces of the people present were all different. [Yang Zhong] humbly nodded.
0:58:28|0:58:37|[Yang Zhong] put his arm around the director's shoulder and confidently pointed at the villa. The director frowned and looked at [Yang Zhong], who nodded slightly. The director suddenly realized and said:
0:58:47|0:59:10|Luxury cars are driving on the muddy construction site after the rain. Tools and bricks are scattered around. The car slowly enters a large warehouse, and everyone walks inside. The simple land and bare cement walls make up the temporary home for the migrant worker brothers. The director leads the way, looking around. Steel frames and wooden planks can be used as beds, while a few old tables and plastic stools make up a dining area.
0:59:10|0:59:25|While the migrant workers were idle due to the rain, some played cards, some cooked, and crowded together it was quite lively. [Ma Qing] cleared his throat first, and the director slowly blew out smoke rings, truthfully saying: "It's really miserable."
0:59:42|0:59:53|The crowd was indifferent, the director scolded the whole team, [Yang Zhong] then walked up and whispered to the director:
1:0:49|1:1:8|At the command, the migrant workers were as excited as if it were the New Year. They quickly climbed into the temporary houses built with colorful cloth strips, tidying up the bedding and daily necessities. Everything was piled onto a small truck, which they pushed out. In just a few minutes, they had packed up their belongings neatly and left. The director, smoking a cigar, watched them leave with satisfaction.
1:1:8|1:1:19|In the evening, the car lights illuminated the warehouse, [Xiao Bai] threw the bedding on the ground in a mess, raising clouds of yellow dust. She hurriedly waved her hand to disperse the dust, and [Director] came forward, sitting on the ground.
1:1:36|1:1:52|[Xiao Bai] pulled hard, yanking the engine on the chair, then climbed into the car himself. The car slowly backed out of the warehouse as night fell, leaving [Director] alone in the empty room. The next day, in an open-air meeting room by the sea,
1:2:40|1:2:45|The little girl's eyes lit up when she heard it,
1:3:12|1:3:19|[Yang Zhong] greeted the customers while wearing a straw hat, and the customers got up and left.
1:3:24|1:3:42|On the lawn of the manor, a high-end party is set up, with guests all dressed in suits and dresses, receiving warm applause. [Yang Zhong] is wearing a custom-made suit and escorting his girlfriend in an elegant strapless gown. The two of them stride down the red carpet, basking in the applause and cheers of the guests.
1:3:42|1:3:45|[Yang Zhong] raised his hand and made a gesture in the air, and the guests quieted down.
1:4:12|1:4:31|The European band started playing amidst whistling. A brand new car drove up, and the guests stepped back to make way. The band singers swayed in the festive atmosphere. A hostess carried a delicate box containing a necklace, but instead of crystal gems, there were car keys inside.
1:4:31|1:4:36|[Yang Zhong] took the hand hanging on his daughter's neck and kissed her forehead.
1:5:30|1:5:37|[Mr. Li] walked over with a determined look, and approached [Yang Zhong] with seriousness. He stood tall and said without any hesitation,
1:5:54|1:6:6|Facing the condemnation of the crowd, [Mr. Li] fearlessly glanced over and walked, saying: He ascended the high platform and arrogantly looked down, saying:
1:6:33|1:6:57|Mr. Li showed a hostile attitude, [Yang Zhong] hurriedly stepped forward, and said anxiously: "Mr. Li," as he walked quickly down the red carpet.
1:7:7|1:7:12|[Ma Qing] greeted everyone, and the extras all came forward. He squeezed out of the crowd and approached the little girl.
1:7:36|1:8:14|The young girl was stunned as [Ma Qing] kissed the back of her hand, then turned and walked away. The girl wiped the saliva off her hand. Outside the manor, [Yang Zhong] took off the handcuffs and walked towards the police car. Mr. Li was leaning against the car door, eyes closed in contemplation. [Yang Zhong] reached out to pat him, removed the police siren from the car, and Mr. Li also took off his identification. [Yang Zhong] chuckled as he answered the phone call.
1:8:14|1:8:22|In the hospital's emergency room, [Director] covered in a rash,
1:8:47|1:8:55|The director on the sickbed struggled to make a sound, Yang Zhong leaned in and listened carefully.
1:10:8|1:10:21|[Ma Qing] and [Xiao Bai] carefully helped [Director] up, and slowly supported [Director] to the sofa. [Director] sat down heavily on the sofa, while [Xiao Bai] and [Ma Qing] were feeling sore and achy.
1:10:33|1:10:42|On the sofa, [Director] with a face full of pimples, [Yang Zhong] leaned in and spat out smoke, [Director] with a dazed look in his eyes, [Yang Zhong] lifted his head and moved the cushion away.
1:11:2|1:11:8|The director's words had just fallen when Mommy pushed open the door with three girls.
1:11:28|1:11:50|He greeted [Xiao Bai] with his arm around her shoulder, [Director] waved his hand awkwardly, [Yang Zhong] couldn't believe it, he then went to [Xiao Lu] and tugged at her collar, [Xiao Lu] looked slightly annoyed, [Yang Zhong] then took a step forward with his arm around her, [Xiao Lu] rolled her eyes unwillingly.
1:12:12|1:12:17|[Yang Zhong] said impatiently, "You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear," and then he added,
1:12:38|1:12:51|[Xiao Bai] couldn't help but burst into laughter on the spot, while [Yang Zhong] turned pale with anger. This disturbance almost cost [the Director] his life, but it didn't succeed in the end.
1:12:51|1:13:8|That day, the private custom brought [Director] to a secluded temple in the mountains. Inside the temple, [Xiao Lu] dressed as a Taoist was drinking tea. [Yang Zhong] also dressed as a Taoist, took the tea cup, sniffed it near his nose, and suddenly said,
1:13:16|1:13:22|The director raised his wrist, and the old Taoist priest took his pulse. Ma Qing disguised himself as the director's secretary.
1:14:8|1:14:15|The Director anxiously blocked the way in front of the old Taoist, pretending to be profound as he raised his head and looked at Ma Qing.
1:14:58|1:15:15|The director hurriedly took out a red envelope from his pocket and handed it to Ma Qing, who then passed it to Xiao Lu. Ma Qing bowed and handed out the red envelope, which Xiao Bai stuffed into his wide sleeve. The old Taoist priest approached and whispered to him, then took off his beautiful beard.
1:15:25|1:15:53|On a clear day at the dock, [Ma Qing] led the way, followed by Wang Aqiang who was picking cotton. Compared to [Ma Qing]'s business attire, Aqiang was dressed in simple farmer's clothes, carrying tools for picking cotton on his back. He wore a straw hat, coarse cloth clothes, and a large striped bag slung over his shoulder, following [Ma Qing] cautiously. Aqiang occasionally glanced around at the surroundings. In the outdoor negotiation room, Aqiang performed cotton picking, receiving sparse applause as he approached the pile of cotton at the table.
1:16:2|1:16:9|The crowd couldn't help but sway along. [Ma Qing] said to the [Director]:
1:16:41|1:17:5|[Director] sat up excitedly and said fiercely, "The movie contract person stacked up gold bars. The villagers around Ah Qiang hurriedly poked at him while Ah Qiang sat there foolishly laughing. The contract person wiped off a sweat."
1:17:5|1:17:21|The island immediately held a ceremony, with Wang Aqiang, the contractor, [Director], sitting in front of a long table. The three of them signed the contract at the table, exchanged it with each other, while reporters took photos in front of the table, and behind the table, private custom employees and Aqiang's fellow villagers applauded together, as the contractor shook Aqiang's hand.
1:17:29|1:17:57|He held Ah Qiang with one hand and the director with the other, the camera froze this moment. In the hospital operating room, the doctors adjusted the equipment. Ah Qiang and the director lay on the beds on both sides. The preparation for the surgery was completed. Ah Qiang and the director stared at each other. A tall machine was slowly running, and the doctor's hand kept pressing the air plug. Beside them, [Yang Zhong] said to [Xiao Bai].
1:17:59|1:18:26|The surgery went smoothly. When it came to the blood transfusion, Wang Aqiang's personal cover was printed on billboards on the streets and alleys, even the LED screens of the buildings were filled with Wang Aqiang's exaggerated advertisements, as if a hurricane swept through the entire city. On that day, a helicopter descended from the sky and landed slowly on the helipad. The security guards approached and opened the helicopter. The contracted person got off and was escorted by a line of luxury cars to the Pan-Pacific Film Festival.
1:18:26|1:18:44|The car door opens, and Wang Aqiang, dressed in a sharp suit and sunglasses, steps out. Various media outlets surround him, cameras flashing brightly like stars. Under the sunglasses, Wang Aqiang reveals a confident smile. Magazines about Aqiang's popularity are selling like hotcakes, and even the tacky director's ranking has skyrocketed to the top.
1:18:44|1:18:50|On the big screen at the film festival, he was nominated for the most commercial director, Brother Jackie Chan.
1:18:52|1:19:1|Yang Zhong was awarded loudly. The applause thundered for a moment, and Ah Qiang below the stage was pleasantly surprised. He went on stage and hugged Brother Cheng Long.
1:19:6|1:19:22|He raised the trophy high, and thunderous applause rang out again, celebrating this important moment. And at the top of the stairs in the art gallery hung clouds, custom-made for private visits.
1:20:4|1:20:19|On the stage, the lights illuminated the flushing toilet. The Director, with disheveled gray hair, carrying a tool filled with cotton, jumped to the toilet and performed a scene of flushing after using the restroom. Then he moved to the small table covered with cotton, with a cotton cloud-shaped lamp hanging above.
1:20:24|1:20:45|The director performed cotton candy popping, instinctively incorporating the characteristics of orchestral instruments, tapping on tools while popping cotton candy, repeatedly, as if intoxicated, momentarily lost in a state of ecstasy. The performance on stage was full of climaxes, leaving the audience and the custom-made staff in awe.
1:20:59|1:21:25|On this sunny day in the park, with a gentle breeze blowing, few visitors scattered around. On a small boat under the bridge, river cleaner [Sister Dan] was pulling out water plants from the river. [Xiao Bai] was on the boat rowed by [Ma Qing]. Sister Dan, whose skin was rough from years of sun exposure, turned her head to look at Ma Qing, furrowing her brow in thought.
1:23:1|1:23:23|[Sister Dan] remained calm, pondered for a moment, then opened her eyes and said, [Xiao Bai] looked at [Ma Qing] with difficulty, and [Ma Qing] also frowned. In the luxurious estate, there were European-style grand palaces, gardens, lawns, fountains, and sculptures. At this moment, a car stopped in front of the gate, and out came [Xiao Bai], [Ma Qing], and [Sister Dan]. The three of them walked towards the stairs and entered the huge palace.
1:23:23|1:23:38|In the lobby, the eye-catching sight is the cosplayers, with a wide range of characters from ancient to modern times, from presidents and emperors to palace maids, from Guan Gong and Qin Qiong to the clown Lu Xun. Each realistic portrayal truly broadens [Sister Dan]'s horizons, even on the stairs.
1:23:45|1:23:52|[Ma Qing] opens the door to the second floor, where [Xiao Lu] and [Yang Zhong] have been waiting by the luxurious dressing table. [Sister Dan] sneaks a glance from the doorway.
1:24:49|1:24:57|[Ma Qing] walked out with big steps, casually closing the exquisite gate. Soon after, inside the house, [Sister Dan] sat in front of the mirror, while [Xiao Lu] had already done her delicate makeup.
1:27:2|1:27:10|[Sister Dan] immediately took the 10,000 cash handed over by [Yang Zhong] and started counting, while [Xiao Lu] kept track of time for her. [Yang Zhong] was closely watching her progress.
1:28:27|1:28:38|Hearing this, the two private custom-made individuals nodded in agreement, setting a good tone. Sister Dan adjusted her clothes in front of the mirror, while Xiao Lu put a large string of pearl necklace on her.
1:28:50|1:29:17|[Xiao Lu] nodded, [Sister Dan] took out a bottle of perfume, sprayed it vigorously on her neck, then saw [Xiao Lu] and said, "[Xiao Lu]" took the perfume and sprayed it into the air in front of her, took big steps forward, bathed in the perfume, then handed the perfume to [Sister Dan], and [Sister Dan] imitated her actions.
1:31:42|1:32:1|The scene shifts to the street, where the [Driver] is driving a luxurious business car with [Sister Dan] and her entourage inside. The car slowly stops in front of a mansion, with uniformed security guards on either side of the gate. When the car comes to a stop, the guards step forward to open the door. Wearing a small hat and carrying an umbrella, [Yang Zhong] gets out of the car and offers his elbow as support for [Sister Dan] to get out.
1:32:28|1:32:47|[Yang Zhong] helped [Sister Dan] back to the car. Sitting in the car, [Sister Dan] gave him a cold look. [Yang Zhong] looked at the indifferent [Sister Dan] and said, "Hurry up and support your arm." [Sister Dan] unceremoniously supported him, stepped out of the car, and stared at him with a fierce look. Despite some twists and turns, [Sister Dan] had completely entered the role.
1:35:22|1:35:31|[Sister Dan] left the manager with a forced smile and walked to the sofa to take a break.
1:36:5|1:36:18|Bending over, [Sister Dan] was earnestly pleading with her manager, who was also taken aback by the price. He sat on the sofa and said meaningfully, "[Sister Dan]," who immediately packed up her things and got up with a look of disdain.
1:36:31|1:36:43|In the downtown mall, San'er walked in front with [Sister Dan], followed by [Xiao Lu]. The stewardess and socialite dressed to impress, attracting attention. The elevator took the three up to the top floor, where high-end restaurants were located.
1:36:43|1:36:50|[Sister Dan] looked around and walked quickly towards Songhe Building. She hurried into the restaurant and shouted loudly to the crowded guests,
1:37:12|1:37:18|[Sister Dan] walked in and glanced at the cabinet on the left, then looked at the display shelf on the right, pointing at them extravagantly and shouting,
1:37:47|1:37:53|San'er walked out with [Sister Dan].
1:38:28|1:38:40|The two looked at the area west of the Forbidden City, San'er nodded along, then they looked east, [Sister Dan] smiled broadly, she was very satisfied with this performance.
1:39:3|1:39:16|At the command, the lights on both sides of the east and west districts lit up in turn. San led [Sister Dan] down the steps, experiencing a day of wealth. She was filled with mixed emotions.
1:41:27|1:41:31|[Ma Qing] reached out and picked up the remote control to adjust the radio, changing the frequency to the agreed hertz.
1:41:44|1:41:50|Sister Dan couldn't help but smile warmly at Ma Qing, while Yang Zhong, lying on the back seat, had already fallen asleep.
1:43:19|1:43:34|After a day of rushing around in the song, [Sister Dan] took off the makeup that didn't belong to her. The car slowly stopped at the narrow entrance of her alley. [Sister Dan], who had enjoyed the scenery all day, walked alone towards the dim depths of the alley. Where has all the time gone?
1:43:34|1:43:49|Perhaps this question still lingers in her mind, but she is also secretly happy. In this city, too many people have not realized their wishes. After a lot of turmoil, she also realized that simplicity is true. On the beautiful island, the scenery is picturesque.
1:43:49|1:43:57|The employees of Private Customization are on vacation by the seaside, with [Yang Zhong] drinking coconut juice, [Xiao Bai] fanning herself, and [Ma Qing] and [Xiao Lu] sunbathing on mats.
1:44:29|1:44:35|[Xiao Lu] stood up and jumped into the pool,
1:45:32|1:45:40|[Xiao Bai] suddenly realized, nodded in agreement, while [Xiao Lu] swam back to the shore at this moment.
1:46:48|1:47:11|[Xiao Bai] walked over and lightly patted him, saying, [Xiao Lu] also helplessly patted his shoulder, feeling sorry for him. Since the decision was made to start the apology action, the private customization was put on the agenda. The company on Hainan Island was already empty, leaving only the beautiful scenery of the sea and the company billboards shining with lights.
1:47:11|1:47:28|The coconut trees swayed gently in the evening breeze as the private group set off on their journey, with the airport as their next stop. The sunny Hainan airport welcomed four mysterious visitors in suits and sunglasses, walking side by side with their luggage, exuding a confident and casual air in their steady steps.
1:47:51|1:48:11|The four characters bowed simultaneously and spoke this classic line. On that day, the northern city was shrouded in smog, with tall buildings covered in haze. A slender figure walked on the Chen Guang Bridge, standing there looking at the sun obscured by the mist. She solemnly said:
1:49:37|1:49:53|[Ma Qing] arrived at a grassland carrying a backpack and wearing hiking boots. The grassland was filled with terrifying sinkholes, and in the distance, cows were grazing on the edge.
1:50:13|1:50:20|[Ma Qing] finished speaking and knelt on the ground with both knees. The vast grassland was full of deep pits, and [Ma Qing] looked on with a heavy heart.
1:50:30|1:50:39|The devastated grassland is a masterpiece of human greed. [Yang Zhong] also arrived at the riverbank in the woods, where the river water is no longer clear, replaced by red marshes and chemical waste rocks.
1:50:40|1:50:47|[Yang Zhong] leaned against a rock by the river, took a sip of wine, and helplessly screwed the bottle cap back on as he looked at the water.
1:51:42|1:51:46|Deeply touched, [Yang Zhong] unscrews the small flask and is about to drink.
