0:3:16|0:3:21|In the restaurant, the nouveau riche took off his coat and sat across from [Zuo Xiaoxin], who stood aside, avoiding him with disdain.
0:4:22|0:4:47|After saying that, [Zuo Xiaoxin] turned and left without looking back. By now, the dusk had faded away, and the night was gradually falling. The corner bar was lit up with bright neon lights. Zhang Yi was sitting on the sofa, but his eyes were fixed on the beautiful woman sitting by the railing on the second floor.
0:4:54|0:4:58|This is Zuo Xiaoxin noticing him on TV.
0:5:22|0:5:37|Cha Yi sat across from the beauty. Finally, [Cha Yi] gestured with his finger, and the beauty arrogantly turned to the side and leaned in to listen. [Cha Yi] quickly stood up, leaned in close to her ear, and whispered.
0:5:51|0:6:10|The young man stood anxiously next to the beauty and said. The young man stared with wide eyes at the two of them in disbelief, Zuo Xiaoxin shrugged and reached out to the beauty. Downstairs, the two good brothers admired them and then packed up their things to fulfill their promise.
0:6:36|0:6:44|Hey, [Zuo Xiaoxin] pulled Xie Dongping outside, and when they reached a place with no one around, she turned her back to Xie Dongping and said.
0:7:9|0:7:12|[Zuo Xiaoxin] let go of his hand when he remained silent, disappointed. Seeing no response, [Zuo Xiaoxin] turned away and handed him a roll of film.
0:7:34|0:7:51|After Xie Dongping finished speaking and left, [Zuo Xiaoxin] looked at his back in confusion. On the other side, the eerie night scene of the bar made people's eyes blurred. In the middle of the dance floor, the enchanting girl twisted her body wildly to the deafening electronic music, her fair skin particularly eye-catching.
0:7:51|0:7:57|Sitting in the corner, [Cha Yi] stared straight at the enchanting girl in the middle of the dance floor, while his good buddy [Zuo Xiaoxin] was speechless.
0:8:0|0:8:5|After speaking, Cha Yi smiled smugly, and the two good brothers nodded in approval. Suddenly, Thirteen's phone rang.
0:9:5|0:9:21|In his thirties, a tough guy who goes after what he wants. Soon after, [Cha Yi] picked up his glass and headed towards the dance floor. His two buddies stared in shock at his back as he walked away. When the seductive girl stopped, he stared straight at her legs in front of him and said.
0:9:27|0:9:33|The charming girl remained unmoved, continuing to show off her figure. Meanwhile, on the bridge.
0:11:14|0:11:16|At this moment, the young man opposite only listened to Dan Qi.
0:11:40|0:11:51|In the end, [Zuo Xiaoxin] deliberately fed food to Danqi, causing her to be emotionally moved. Suddenly, [Zuo Xiaoxin] slapped her on the buttocks, and the two of them acted in a way that scared the young man away.
0:14:13|0:14:21|[Zuo Xiaoxin] said disdainfully, then picked up the milk on the side and started drinking, looking at Cha Yi on the stage, while everyone kept dancing along with the music.
0:15:46|0:15:59|[Zuo Xiaoxin] looked at them with a determined expression, and finally, they walked over with measured steps. [Zuo Xiaoxin] remained unmoved, with sharp eyes fixed on them, staring intently. The leader, Cha Yi, locked eyes with a sharp gaze, his left hand in his pocket.
0:15:59|0:16:12|The two people walking side by side behind also took steps, showing their charm while making what they thought was the coolest move. Immediately after, [Zuo Xiaoxin] slowly stood up, and after Cha Yi stopped in his tracks, she smiled at him.
0:16:18|0:16:33|[Zuo Xiaoxin] looked puzzled, but Cha Yi didn't give her a chance to react. He turned and walked towards the other side of the open space. Bai Xue saw Zuo Xiaoxin standing still and reminded her. Zuo Xiaoxin casually turned around and sat down.
0:16:33|0:16:42|At this moment, Thirteen called the waiter to bring wine. The waiter handed over a wine cup, and Thirteen took it and handed it directly to Cha Yi. Cha Yi sniffed it at the tip of his nose.
0:16:59|0:17:14|Suddenly, the two of them seemed to be in a desert. They knelt on a flat ground, dressed in samurai attire, each holding a long knife. Zuo Xiaoxin stared closely at [Cha Yi]'s pupils, and his eyes involuntarily narrowed slightly, with a glint of spiritual power flashing through. Cha Yi, who was nervous, had beads of sweat forming on his forehead.
0:17:39|0:17:52|Zuo Xiaoxin cut his arm, then Cha Yi placed the long knife between the two blocks. He aimed the handle of the knife directly at his vital point, the intense pain causing him to collapse to the ground.
0:18:3|0:18:17|On the other side, Zuo Xiaoxin supported herself with a knife, struggling to stand up and walk to Cha Yi. Coming back to reality, Zuo Xiaoxin smiled triumphantly. Cha Yi raised his hand to stop the massage for a moment.
0:18:33|0:18:54|Following that, the two best friends squeezed mustard into the red wine. Drunk Xie Dongping grabbed the wine glass from Zuo Xiaoxin's hand and drank it all in one gulp, while the people around him looked at him menacingly.
0:19:4|0:19:19|Bai Xue poured another glass of wine and placed it in front of [Cha Yi]. Zuo Xiaoxin propped her face with one hand, provocatively staring at her. Then, she picked up the glass and took a big sip through the straw.
0:19:32|0:19:49|Tears silently streamed down [Cha Yi]'s face at this moment.
0:19:58|0:20:2|As Cha Yi looked up at Zuo Xiaoxin, he saw her unbuttoning the buttons on her chest.
0:20:8|0:20:21|The seemingly simple action was alluring in Cha Yi's eyes. The brother's clothes made Zuo Xiaoxin's originally fair skin appear even more delicate. His fingers casually brushed over his lips, sexy and seductive.
0:20:21|0:20:29|The other four made successful gestures on the side, then the two arrived at the Bird's Nest themed hotel, with Zuo Xiaoxin following closely behind, using her foot to close the door.
0:20:35|0:20:42|Suddenly, Zuo Xiaoxin pushed Cha Yi onto the bed, quickly straddling him and then kneeling to take off his jacket.
0:20:46|0:20:58|At the same time, the four of them were lying on the door, scrambling to eavesdrop. Er Tiao jumped and landed directly on Shi San. Inside the room, Zuo Xiaoxin forcefully pulled off Cha Yi's shirt, urgently unbuttoning his shirt.
0:20:58|0:21:4|Cha Yi stared at him with a lecherous look on his face, and then he pushed his head down and continued with his actions.
0:21:5|0:21:12|At this moment, Cha Yi reached out to unbutton his shirt, but Zuo Xiaoxin objected and placed his hand aside, as did the other hand.
0:21:15|0:21:27|Later, he flipped over and pinned [Zuo Xiaoxin] underneath him. As he tried to unbutton the front of [Zuo Xiaoxin]'s shirt, he was pushed away by her. Cha Yi couldn't contain the heat in his heart, watching her lips steady.
0:21:28|0:21:48|She immediately turned her head to the side, constantly dodging. Then, Zhang Yi turned towards her neck, and [Zuo Xiaoxin] slowly accepted her kiss. Suddenly, Zhang Yi sat up straight, took off his shirt, and kept attacking her most vulnerable spot.
0:21:48|0:21:54|Zuo Xiaoxin eavesdropped on her best friend with glee, as the battle inside the room intensified and the crystal chandelier emitted a perplexing light.
0:22:8|0:22:12|After the two finished the battle, [Zuo Xiaoxin] immediately did a handstand in the corner.
0:23:5|0:23:8|He immediately picked up things, still cursing at [Zuo Xiaoxin].
0:23:13|0:23:31|At this moment, a lively sperm suddenly appeared on the screen. He saw four sperm harassing a young and beautiful egg cell. So, he bravely stepped forward to drive them away for the egg cell. The flattered egg cell was instantly attracted to him, and they successfully combined. With the push of the chromosomes, the embryo gradually took shape.
0:23:31|0:23:35|As time passed, the little baby was also born smoothly, one year and nine months later.
0:24:11|0:24:24|On the other side, at the Beijing Meifeng Hospital. [Zuo Xiaoxin] was holding the child, preparing to stand up, but suddenly felt dizzy and immediately grabbed onto the chair.
0:25:17|0:25:27|Zuo Xiaoxin and Cha Yi, who were eavesdropping, suddenly realized that a group of people had arrived behind them. At that moment, Cha Yi and the beautiful woman walked out.
0:25:53|0:25:56|On the other side, [Zuo Xiaoxin] was working hard to scrub the oil stains on the stove.
0:27:26|0:27:28|[Xie Dongping] is busy working alone in the kitchen.
0:29:26|0:29:29|Zuo Xiaoxin and Cha Yi walked on the overpass, with Er Tiao helplessly lowering his head and following behind.
0:30:11|0:30:28|Suddenly, the scene cuts back to the night when the two first met, with their chests pressed tightly against each other, feeling the rise and fall of each other's breath. When emotions ran deep, [Zuo Xiaoxin] tore down the last barrier between them. Just then, the sound of the boiling kettle brought [Zuo Xiaoxin] back to reality, as he tried to calm his emotions.
0:30:29|0:30:43|Immediately, he turned off the valve, picked up the water bottle, made formula milk for the baby, and even tested the temperature of the milk with his wrist. At the same time, [Cha Yi] also came up according to the room information, cautiously opening his phone to record before knocking on the door.
0:31:3|0:31:12|Without waiting for him to finish speaking, he walked past [Zuo Xiaoxin] and into the room. As he looked around, [Zuo Xiaoxin] had already placed the slippers at his feet.
0:31:12|0:31:22|Cha Yi bent down, changing his shoes leisurely. At that moment, [Zuo Xiaoxin] was lost in thought, but as Cha Yi stood up, he immediately turned around to conceal himself.
0:31:30|0:31:50|Cha Yi lowered his head helplessly and followed [Zuo Xiaoxin] to a door. [Zuo Xiaoxin] gently pushed open the door, but when Cha Yi clearly saw the child on the crib, he immediately dropped his carefree demeanor. He walked slowly towards the crib, his eyes fixed on the child inside.
0:31:50|0:31:52|At this moment, the child also showed him a innocent smile.
0:31:56|0:32:15|Cha Yi gently lifts the gauze curtain in front of the baby crib and carefully observes the child. At that moment, the child reaches out to Cha Yi, while [Zuo Xiaoxin] watches this scene, feeling conflicted inside, unsure if what he is doing is right. Then, Cha Yi lifts the child over his head with both hands.
0:32:25|0:32:38|When Cha Yi held the child in his arms, the heartwarming scene triggered an illusion for [Zuo Xiaoxin]. In that moment, Cha Yi was wearing a cloak, cradling the child in his arms while she looked on with contentment at the child who was already fast asleep.
0:32:38|0:32:50|At first, she, who was just a kind father, exuded the radiance of paternal love all over her body. [Zuo Xiaoxin] sat on the side, hands crossed, watching them. At this moment, her eyes were filled with excited tears, hoping so much that all of this could become reality.
0:32:51|0:33:12|While he was immersed in this beautiful and heartwarming scene, the clock hanging on the wall suddenly made a sound. The chime brought him back to reality, and after he adjusted his emotions, he immediately walked forward to take the child from Zuo Xiaoxin's arms.
0:35:17|0:35:23|Cha Yi climbed up the wall by stepping on Zuo Xiaoxin's shoulders.
0:36:19|0:36:32|Zuo Xiaoxin quickly took off his glasses in order to cover up Zai's escape, but was discovered by [Cha Yi]. He quickly checked on the child, only to find that the child had just lost a wet diaper. Outside the wall, Thirteen had just removed the wet diaper from his face when Zai pressed it back on.
0:37:27|0:37:33|Danqi, exuding feminine charm all over her body, completely captivated Zuo Xiaoxin, who didn't listen to a word she said.
0:37:47|0:37:49|Danqi looked at Er Tiao in disbelief, while on the other side, [Zuo Xiaoxin] sat in the car and answered the phone.
0:38:33|0:38:45|Putting down her phone, [Zuo Xiaoxin] leaned directly on the steering wheel. She was exhausted, unsure of what to do. Then, she slowly lifted her head to look outside the car window, only to see the words "Bird's Nest Theme Hotel" looming in front of her.
0:39:8|0:39:11|This is Zuo Xiaoxin and Cha Yi secretly changing cards at the bottom of the pearl.
0:39:27|0:39:31|[Cha Yi] turned his head slowly and said calmly.
0:40:2|0:40:9|Three people were riding on an electric scooter, and a beautiful woman in a nurse uniform stood up slowly. The woman turned around, revealing herself to be [Cha Yi].
0:40:32|0:40:46|The curly-haired man stuck the toothpick in his mouth onto the needle held by his son.
0:42:50|0:42:57|The next day, [Zhang Yi] arrived at the door with a bouquet of flowers.
0:43:44|0:43:59|Finally, [Cha Yi] led his two good brothers to join in. Thirteen and Er Tiao followed the music, constantly moving their bodies in the living room, while Cha Yi sat in the corner playing with the child. Before long, the two good brothers were preparing food for everyone in the kitchen.
0:44:3|0:44:6|Putting an egg in there, the protein will coagulate rapidly.
0:44:50|0:45:0|Just as everyone was enjoying themselves, [Zuo Xiaoxin] walked in through the door.
0:45:8|0:45:33|[Zuo Xiaoxin] handed the child directly to the mother. Holding a cane, [Zuo Xiaoxin] threatened Cha Yi, but just as Cha Yi was about to fall, he accidentally touched the overturned box on the table, which had "loosely" written on it. He suddenly realized something and turned to look at the people in the living room.
0:45:37|0:45:43|Cha Yi covered his mouth and walked out of the room, followed immediately by his two good brothers. Suddenly, the handle of the female duck's card appeared on the screen.
0:47:53|0:47:57|Finally, Zuo Xiaoxin and Cha Yi were driving on the road in the second car, when suddenly Cha Yi's phone rang.
0:48:11|0:48:17|Sitting in the middle of the restaurant, [Cha Yi] hung up the phone expressionlessly. But not long after, a strange smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.
0:49:20|0:49:24|[Zuo Xiaoxin] walked into the restaurant.
0:49:43|0:50:1|After sitting down with [Zuo Xiaoxin], Zhang Yi took out the package behind him and pushed it in front of him. He opened the package, revealing a gun holster inside, followed by a wooden pistol. [Zuo Xiaoxin] quickly rewrapped the package and put it back into the bag.
0:50:9|0:50:13|[Zuo Xiaoxin] turned and left, while [Cha Yi] saw that the men were unmoved and anxiously slapped the bald man.
0:51:24|0:51:33|In a daze, the younger brothers were knocked down, and then Zuo Xiaoxin was seen fixing her hair and walking towards the bald man.
0:51:46|0:52:2|Kneeling on the ground begging for mercy, Cha Yi caught a glimpse of the bald man escaping, then slowly lifted his head and half-lying on the ground. At the same time, [Zuo Xiaoxin] walked towards him and reached out her right hand. In Cha Yi's eyes, [Zuo Xiaoxin] was shining all over, like a savior.
0:52:2|0:52:10|He instinctively reached out his hand and, with the help of [Cha Yi], stood up. Then, [Zuo Xiaoxin] put his arm around his shoulder and they walked out together.
0:53:21|0:53:29|After speaking, all the workers on the scene immediately turned and left. [Zuo Xiaoxin] irritably placed the helmet aside and looked at the design drawings on the table.
0:54:22|0:54:24|The staff standing at the edge of the building all gave thumbs up.
0:54:37|0:55:3|At the construction site, a vast open space with hundreds of construction machinery operating intensively. The deafening roar of the machines fills the air, yet the construction workers continue to work at heights. At this moment, Zha Yi is huddled in a corner of the elevator, gasping for breath. Before long, the elevator reaches the top floor.
0:55:18|0:55:25|Zuo Xiaoxin walked leisurely by the alley with his hands in his pockets. Cha Yi, who was kneeling on the ground, immediately released the pillar.
0:55:32|0:55:43|Cha Yi walked along the inner side of the aisle, leaning against the wall to catch up with Zuo Xiaoxin. Then, Zuo Xiaoxin opened the lunch box in her hand, revealing a well-arranged meal that whetted his appetite.
0:55:46|0:55:56|Cha Yi used a fork to bring the food to his mouth, but he disdainfully snatched the fork and walked to the other side, simply sitting on the steps. It was then that Zuo Xiaoxin spoke up.
0:56:1|0:56:8|Zhang Yiben wanted to sit next to her, but her eyes accidentally looked downstairs, scaring her into running back immediately.
0:57:7|0:57:11|At this moment, a middle-aged man upstairs warmly greeted Zuo Xiaoxin.
0:57:31|0:57:33|Zhang Yi approached Zuo Xiaoxin and sniffed back and forth with his nose for diagnosis.
0:57:37|0:57:41|[Zuo Xiaoxin] looked at [Cha Yi] helplessly, then turned around and left.
0:59:7|0:59:11|After Xie Dongping finished singing, he casually picked up the flowers placed aside, turned around, and knelt down on one knee in front of [Zuo Xiaoxin].
0:59:17|0:59:28|On the other side, [Cha Yi] pushed open the door of the restroom. Xie Dongping, who was using the toilet, turned around to see [Cha Yi] showing off while holding a ring.
1:0:16|1:0:19|[Zuo Xiaoxin] helped up Zha Yi who was lying on the ground and said.
1:0:25|1:0:31|Xie Dongping quietly picked up the ring from the ground, pinching and scratching me.
1:0:38|1:0:40|Cha Yi looked around with a blank expression on his face and said.
1:1:47|1:1:57|[Zuo Xiaoxin] shyly covered her ears and ran to the side, but when she turned to look at Cha Yi, the two of them rode their bikes over, and Cha Yi instinctively grabbed her hand and pulled her back.
1:1:57|1:2:16|The sudden move made [Zuo Xiaoxin] feel a flutter in her heart. She stared at him intently, and just as she was about to give in, [Zuo Xiaoxin] slowly withdrew her hand and then turned to leave. Cha Yi immediately chased after her, then reached out and pulled him back. The two of them walked down the road, secretly delighted in their hearts.
1:2:16|1:2:28|After an unknown amount of time, the two continued to walk side by side. Zuo Xiaoxin, who was experiencing her first love, shyly lowered her head. Suddenly, the sound of a clock above the square rang out, causing the two to stop in their tracks and look at each other.
1:2:29|1:2:47|[Zhang] stared straight at himself, [Zuo Xiaoxin] shyly lowered her head, but when he looked up again, he saw the brightly lit Bird's Nest themed hotel where the two had first met that night, which stood out especially in the night. In [Zuo Xiaoxin]'s mind, scenes of the two sweetly intertwined at that moment emerged.
1:2:47|1:2:57|[Zhang] noticed his abnormality, and as he followed his gaze, at this moment, [Zuo Xiaoxin] suddenly averted her eyes, blushing, and ran forward, [Zhang] immediately followed suit.
1:3:45|1:3:52|At this moment, Cha Yi had already rushed downstairs, tearing off the plank tied to his leg as he ran. Zuo Xiaoxin followed closely behind.
1:3:56|1:4:11|Cha Yi ran forward with all his might, at this moment, he didn't care about the injuries on his body, his only concern was the safety of his son. [Zuo Xiaoxin], although practiced Taekwondo, was not as physically fit as Cha Yi. He gasped for breath heavily, but dared not stop, dragging his exhausted body forward.
1:4:11|1:4:18|At this moment, a taxi slowly stopped at the intersection, and Cha Yi stumbled to the driver's window.
1:4:25|1:4:46|In the end, Cha Yi opened the back door of the car, and the child was lying inside unharmed. Zuo Xiaoxin kept kissing the child, then the two of them walked back home. Zuo Xiaoxin suddenly looked at Cha Yi's leg, and asked with a questioning look on her face.
1:5:28|1:5:33|Zhang Yishuang failed to perform smoothly, sat on the ground with a sigh, and [Zuo Xiaoxin] was speechless.
1:5:49|1:6:1|Later, as the vast staircase came into view, Cha Yi, with his bicycle, stood in the middle. He nervously swallowed and turned to Zuo Xiaoxin for reassurance, only to be met with a mocking expression on Zuo Xiaoxin's face.
1:6:1|1:6:16|Continuing, he bravely accelerated the car towards the stairs, but just as he was about to reach the landing, he urgently hit the brakes with his foot. Clearly, this outcome was within the expectations of [Zuo Xiaoxin]. He stood up straight, looking disdainfully at Cha Yi, who spoke calmly.
1:6:29|1:6:46|Cha Yi picked up the bicycle and caught up. As night fell, rows of street lights illuminated the darkness, accompanied by the cool night breeze. [Zuo Xiaoxin] and Cha Yi stood in front of the window of the children's room, looking up at the starry sky. Their figures appeared particularly slender against the backdrop of the night. At this moment, Cha Yi spoke first.
1:7:20|1:7:37|On the rooftop, under the colorful lights, [Cha Yi] looked at [Zuo Xiaoxin] with a serious expression, his face filled with affection. Then, he held [Zuo Xiaoxin]'s shoulders with both hands and kissed her without hesitation. At this moment, [Zuo Xiaoxin] faced her inner feelings calmly, closing her eyes to feel his kiss.
1:7:37|1:7:51|As the camera zooms out, two aliens are seen holding a telescope and looking at them. Seeing the couple finally together, they gradually put down the telescope and gaze at each other. Then, the female alien caresses the other's face with one hand and passionately kisses.
1:7:52|1:8:7|At this moment, it seems like the world has become beautiful. The best part is that after time passes, the old people, old things, and even the old feelings that you truly love are still there. Things that can last must have weight, and they can withstand the repeated erosion and washing of time.
1:9:28|1:9:35|Alright, I'll go set up the camera. The next day, Zhang arrived early at the Bird's Nest Theme Hotel.
1:9:42|1:9:46|At this moment, [Zuo Xiaoxin] strolled in leisurely.
1:10:33|1:10:56|On the other side, [Zuo Xiaoxin] and [Cha Yi] were tightly embracing each other, but [Cha Yi] showed no passion at this moment. His eyes scanned the ceiling, searching for hidden cameras. The images of the two appeared on thirteen computer screens, sparking his interest instantly. He took a big sip of freshly brewed milk tea, only to be scalded and grimace in pain.
1:10:59|1:11:13|Shortly after, [Zuo Xiaoxin] and [Cha Yi] reluctantly moved towards the bathroom. In front of the computer, the two had already prepared tissues. He took off his pants, sat on the stool, closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and tried to adjust his eager mood to watch.
1:11:13|1:11:22|At this moment, [Cha Yi] in the room was extremely anxious, hesitating on the edge of moral boundaries, and ultimately he extinguished his competitive spirit.
1:11:26|1:11:34|While Zuo Xiaoxin was checking the computer at thirteen, she accidentally knocked over the milk tea cup.
1:12:5|1:12:16|Zhang Yi turned around and pinned [Zuo Xiaoxin] down. On the other side, Danqi took out her phone and looked incredulously at the two, while the two who realized they had said the wrong thing kept avoiding Danqi's gaze.
1:12:26|1:12:46|After speaking, [Zuo Xiaoxin] turned around, took out her phone from the bag, while [Cha Yi] continued to kiss every inch of her skin unknowingly. But when [Zuo Xiaoxin] saw the message on the phone, the smile on her face instantly froze. Then, [Cha Yi] casually looked up and also noticed the message displayed on the phone.
1:12:46|1:12:51|[Zuo Xiaoxin] pushed [Cha Yi] aside, looked up and suddenly realized that the camera was hidden in the ventilation duct.
1:13:7|1:13:20|Zhang Yi was beaten to the ground, howling in pain. At the same time, Zuo Xiaoxin, in a hurry to chase Danqi, hastily climbed over the fence but ended up hanging himself on it, causing serious injury to his groin.
1:13:24|1:13:30|In the hospital restroom, the three brothers stood in a row with blue expressions on their faces, ready to use the toilet.
1:13:55|1:13:59|Upon returning home, Cha Yi immediately took out his phone and dialed Zuo Xiaoxin's number.
1:14:8|1:14:26|At this moment, [Zuo Xiaoxin] is standing by the window lost in thought, looking at her phone ringing. After a moment of contemplation, she decisively opens her contacts and deletes Cha Yi. Back at home, [Zuo Xiaoxin] takes out a box left by her father, inside which contains a photo of her father and a wooden-carved gun.
1:14:26|1:14:33|Following that, she opened the cloth bag in front of her, revealing a collection of tools used for carving. She then picked up one of them and wiped it clean with a piece of cloth.
1:14:35|1:14:53|On the other side, after much contemplation, Cha Yi decided to make a fresh start. He was seen sitting on the sofa, feeding each photo in his hand into the shredder. In this way, he bid farewell to the past, wanting to start all over again. In fact, his feelings towards Zuo Xiaoxin had already changed at this moment.
1:14:53|1:15:2|He just kept hurting the fragile heart of [Zuo Xiaoxin]. Then, he flipped through the photo album on his phone, reminiscing about the good times.
1:15:17|1:15:29|At this moment, [Cha Yi] was once again deeply moved. Later, he arrived fully armed outside the door of [Zuo Xiaoxin]'s house. Seeing that the visitor was [Cha Yi], [Zuo Xiaoxin] angrily closed the door.
1:15:29|1:15:41|So, [Cha Yi] rang the doorbell again, but [Zuo Xiaoxin] had placed the power cord on the doorbell, and a powerful electric current hit his body. Seeing [Zuo Xiaoxin] so determined, [Cha Yi] who wouldn't give up, turned to look for Danqi.
1:15:45|1:15:52|Following that, he went to find another close girlfriend, Bai Xue.
1:16:37|1:16:44|Three people were chatting without any regard for the grandfather playing on the tablet nearby. Although the grandfather suffered from senile dementia, his memory was astonishing.
1:17:6|1:17:11|Returning home at night, he found his son reading in the study and mysteriously said to him.
1:17:44|1:17:52|Zuo Xiaoxin, carrying her nursing bag, went to the groom's house for a formal meeting.
1:19:11|1:19:18|Upon hearing this, [Cha Yi] lowered his head and fell into contemplation. A few days ago.
1:19:22|1:19:27|In order to obtain custody of the child. The female lawyer refuted the plaintiff's claim by arguing that the relationship was consensual.
1:20:27|1:20:31|The future education and growth environment of these children are also factors to consider.
1:21:18|1:21:27|[Zuo Xiaoxin] immediately stopped what she was doing, shook her head without hesitation, and then escorted her mother to the door of the room.
1:21:36|1:21:52|[Zuo Xiaoxin] looked at her mother [Zuo Mu] in disbelief. She never expected to be so important in her mother's heart. [Zuo Mu] lovingly stroked her daughter's hair, feeling guilty for seeing her daughter living such a hard life. To avoid getting too emotional, she said with a smile.
1:23:14|1:23:33|Late at night, unable to let go of [Zuo Xiaoxin], [Cha Yi] walked with heavy steps to the children's room. She knelt by the bed, gazing affectionately at the loose clothes in her hands. Overwhelmed with longing, she lay on the bed and tears of sorrow streamed down her face. Unknowingly, she fell into a deep sleep.
1:24:10|1:24:13|[Zuo Xiaoxin] arrived at the door of Cha Yi's house, holding a kitchen knife.
1:24:52|1:25:12|Zhang Yi's whole family fled in panic, leaving only the grandfather playing games in the living room. Angry Zuo Xiaoxin kicked open the door, Zhang's mother ran out from the back door holding the child. The scumbag father and [Cha Yi] followed closely behind, running and looking back.
1:25:31|1:25:37|[Zuo Xiaoxin] is holding a knife, ready to go upstairs. She immediately raises the knife in front of her chest and walks towards her grandfather.
1:26:21|1:26:27|Zhang Yi looked panic-stricken towards the door, while [Cha Yi], who stayed behind, avoided his gaze.
1:26:55|1:27:0|The next day, Danqi took Zuo Xiaoxin to Cha's house, only to see the maid packing things up.
1:27:39|1:27:52|Shortly after, the plane landed in Okinawa. At that moment, [Cha Yi], who was taking a walk on the beach, received a message that his grandfather had been tied to a pillar. Following this, [Cha Yi] angrily threw his phone to the ground.
1:28:8|1:28:12|In the restaurant on the other side, three Japanese geishas are performing a traditional tune.
1:29:29|1:29:44|Suddenly, the phone rang and the four of them gathered closely to check the message. The screen displayed that the Ocean Park ship agreed to exchange positions in an hour. Finally, the two arrived as agreed, but when Zuo Xiaoxin was about to check on the child, [Cha Yi] refused to let go.
1:29:54|1:30:5|On the other side of the phone, blocked at the front door of the house. [Cha Yi] frowned, the atmosphere was not suitable. He wanted to turn around and leave, but then turned back.
1:31:20|1:31:26|Angry [Zuo Xiaoxin] pushed [Cha Yi] away and walked off. The more she thought about it, the more wronged she felt, and the anger in her heart was hard to contain.
1:31:31|1:31:48|[Cha Yi] stared at her, furrowing his brow, every word she said deeply piercing his heart. Then, [Zuo Xiaoxin] looked around, searching for the child's figure. Seeing no response, [Zuo Xiaoxin] instantly panicked. At this moment, [Cha Yi] also realized the seriousness of the problem and quickly turned back to search.
1:31:49|1:31:56|On the other side, Grandpa is taking Song Song to visit the Ocean Park. Grandpa, who loves photography, is always holding up his camera to capture moments.
1:32:1|1:32:18|[Zuo Xiaoxin] is extremely anxious, like an ant on a hot pan. He runs around every corner of the park, carefully searching for [Cha Yi]'s figure. Zhang Yi follows him with a look of annoyance. When they arrive at the ocean park, Grandpa has already taken [Cha Yi] away. Unable to find him, Zhang Yi seeks help from others.
1:32:38|1:32:42|[Zuo Xiaoxin] walked desolately on the steps of the aquarium, but she did not give up.
1:33:0|1:33:18|Cha Yi wanted to pull Zuo Xiaoxin, who was sitting on a rock, but she shook him off. Now, he harbored a deep hatred towards Cha Yi. At this moment, the local military and civilians were holding a certain ceremony. Many people were dressed in local costumes, walking and dancing on the streets, while many tourists gathered on both sides of the road to watch.
1:33:18|1:33:21|Cha Yi and Zuo Xiaoxin saw the situation and immediately ran over.
1:33:34|1:33:56|On the other side, the drumming team happened to pass by [Grandpa] and [Song Song]. [Grandpa] curiously picked up the camera to take a picture, only to see the baby carriage slowly sliding towards the stairs. At that moment, [Cha Yi] also noticed [Grandpa]'s figure. [Grandpa] turned around to say hello, but his backpack accidentally pushed the baby carriage down the stairs.
1:33:56|1:33:59|[Cha Yi] saw the situation and ran towards [Zhang Yi] who was playing with a bicycle on the side.
1:34:5|1:34:10|[Zhang Yi] rode his bike straight towards the stairs, leaving the young man behind chasing after him.
1:34:15|1:34:19|However, when the young man ran to the stairs, he realized that [Cha Yi] was actually going to save the child.
1:34:20|1:34:38|When [Cha Yi] rode to the last step, he turned the bike around and accelerated for the safety of the child. Without hesitation, he rushed down. [Zuo Xiaoxin] followed closely, descending the stairs at the fastest speed. Suddenly, the landing spot for the bike was higher, causing both the person and the bike to fall out directly.
1:34:38|1:34:44|While Zuo Xiaoxin was tumbling, Cha Yi also crashed into the guardrail. Soon after, the local military and civilians shouted loudly:
1:34:47|1:34:55|In a hurry, [Zuo Xiaoxin] took two steps at a time, but suddenly Zhang Yi reached the ground before the baby carriage, which was speeding up instead of slowing down.
1:34:58|1:35:12|Cha Yi rolled over in a daze, but it was Zuo Xiaoxin's words that instantly sobered him up. He looked at the baby carriage and slowly got up. Just as the van was about to hit the baby carriage, he ran towards it at lightning speed and grabbed it.
1:35:12|1:35:18|[Zuo Xiaoxin]'s legs also lost strength in an instant, collapsing on the ground, and Zha's parents who rushed over were scared and covered their eyes.
1:36:41|1:36:55|Cha Yi's father took Cha Yi's mother back, with Cha Yi holding his grandfather's hand following behind them. Zuo Xiaoxin held the child with tears in his eyes, feeling heartbroken as he watched their backs, without any joy of taking the child back. The next day, Cha Yi's family was ready to leave.
1:36:56|1:37:4|[Cha Yi] is helped by the waiter to load the luggage of different sizes into the trunk of the taxi, and the waiter bows to him before closing the car door.
1:37:6|1:37:22|On the other side, [Zuo Xiaoxin] sat by the window holding her child in a daze. Seeing this, Danqi was about to go comfort her, but was stopped by Er Tiao. Er Tiao shook his head at him, and Danqi understood, so he retreated behind the curtain. Sitting in the taxi, [Cha Yi] also stared blankly out the window.
1:37:38|1:37:52|Grandpa seemed to be singing out the inner thoughts of [Cha Yi] at this moment. [Cha Yi] withdrew his gaze and looked at Grandpa, then lowered his head. Before long, [Cha Yi]'s family all arrived at the airport. They passed through security, stored their luggage, and his father handed each suitcase to the staff one by one.
1:37:52|1:37:58|The others stood aside waiting, while another staff member completed the procedures for the passengers and politely said.
1:38:0|1:38:14|Suddenly, [Zuo Xiaoxin] appeared at the entrance of the airport. He looked up at the flight information on the screen, then looked around, searching for their figures. However, they had already entered the ticket checkpoint at that time. He hurriedly ran towards the registration desk to inquire.
1:38:19|1:38:29|The service staff did not understand what she said, but instead spoke to her. [Zuo Xiaoxin]'s hope was dashed once again, and she quickly turned to find another place.
1:39:26|1:39:48|I reached out my hand desperately for a long time, and then he walked over, passed by me, and took the bottle behind me. The tour guide next to me translated every word [Zuo Xiaoxin] said to the tourists, and the female tourists present were amazed, covering their mouths.
1:40:49|1:41:4|[Cha Yi] bent down in sorrow and wept, and at that moment, a pair of hands grabbed his arm. When he looked up, he saw that it was Zuo Xiaoxin. Zuo Xiaoxin removed the long hair from his forehead and gently stroked his head.
1:41:8|1:41:27|The two stared into each other's eyes, and the next moment, [Zuo Xiaoxin] tightly hugged him, wishing he could melt into her arms. The onlookers applauded for them, the tour guide's eyes filled with tears, definitely not faked. Someone took out a camera and captured this moment. On the side, even [Cha Yi] was moved and said.
1:41:31|1:41:37|Grandpa Zuo Xiaoxin, with tears in his eyes, immediately stepped forward, picked up the camera hanging on his chest, and captured this touching scene.
1:41:37|1:41:55|Not knowing how long had passed, [Zuo Xiaoxin] and [Cha Yi] stood before the priest, solemnly answering his questions. Whether in happiness or in sorrow, they were willing to give up all others and commit themselves to each other until the end of their lives. [Cha Yi] looked at [Zuo Xiaoxin] and said firmly.
1:41:57|1:42:8|The priest then turned to ask [Zuo Xiaoxin], "Now I ask you, surrender yourself completely to him, until the end of your life." [Zuo Xiaoxin] had a happy smile on her face and replied.
1:42:16|1:42:29|Following that, Zuo Xiaoxin and Cha Yi together lit the candle in the middle of the candlestick, symbolizing their lives becoming one from now on. Finally, everyone stood together and took a happy group photo.
1:44:13|1:44:22|Grandpa was shopping, and the shop assistant gestured for him to come this way and said. Then picked up the packaged bag and escorted Grandpa to the store entrance.
1:44:28|1:44:34|Grandpa quickly returned the gesture, bowing repeatedly to the shop assistant until the assistant smiled and waved at Grandpa.
