0:0:41|0:0:53|In the scene, a man in a shirt takes a bouquet of flowers from a luxury car and gives it to Qin Shunyi, the younger daughter of the mother in this film. Shunyi looks at the flowers and smiles.
0:1:3|0:1:6|Next, the producer [Li Mu Zi] brought a bouquet of flowers.
0:2:2|0:2:6|In the blink of an eye, elder brother [Qin Shunli] arrived at the home of [Mother] with his wife Qianzhu.
0:3:25|0:3:31|The scene shifts, eldest sister [Qin Shunyi] and her family of three are driving on the way to their [mother]'s house.
0:3:53|0:3:57|[Qin Shunyi] smiled indulgently and soon arrived at [Mother]'s house.
0:4:15|0:4:21|Come on, [Mother] carefully examined Tongtong and said.
0:5:40|0:5:43|He looked at the two of them disdainfully, furrowing his brow and said.
0:6:40|0:6:48|In the meeting room, [Qin Shunxin] pushed the door open and [Li Muzi] immediately sat up straight, his voice no longer lazy.
0:7:3|0:7:5|[Qin Shunyi] sighed helplessly.
0:9:5|0:9:7|In the garden, [Qin Shunli] is tending to the flowers and plants.
0:9:27|0:9:29|[Father] humbly picked up the broken plate.
0:10:1|0:10:6|[Qin Shunli] proudly started performing acrobatics again, but accidentally dropped the plate. Meanwhile, [Qin Shunyi] was on the phone.
0:11:9|0:11:13|[Qin Shunxin] stood up and turned his back to Mr. Quan, hiding the needle in the seam of the paper.
0:11:55|0:12:5|The next moment, Qin Shunyi was pricked by the needle hidden in [Qin Shunxin]'s hand. After cursing, [Qin Shunxin] stood up and walked towards the desk. Mr. Quan looked at her in disbelief.
0:13:13|0:13:15|In no time, the young couple arrived at [Mother]'s house.
0:15:28|0:15:31|On the other side, [Qin Shunxin], who had just arrived home, received a phone call from [Mother].
0:16:11|0:16:16|[Qin Shunxin] hung up the phone and walked into the conference room, where [Li Muzi] was sitting at the head of the table and spoke first. The manager took the letter from [Qin Shunxin]'s hand and began to speak.
0:17:15|0:17:19|Saying that, [Li Muzi] packed up and walked out of the meeting room, wanting to run all the way, and came to [Qin Shunxin]'s front.
0:19:18|0:19:24|[Mother] heard her husband say this. She snorted coldly, feeling wronged, and walked away, turning her back and angrily pulling on the leaves.
0:20:1|0:20:4|[Mother] gave her a stern look and said, "[Mother]" furrowed her brow and continued.
0:20:38|0:20:42|[Mother] turned around in anger and walked away, cursing as she left.
0:22:49|0:22:52|Hearing this, [Qin Shunyi] looked at her husband, lost in thought.
0:22:58|0:23:4|[Qin Shunli] just changed the channel, and [Mother] took the remote control and changed it back. Seeing this, Qianzhu looked pleased.
0:23:22|0:23:29|In a sports program, a lively song was playing. Upon seeing her [mother] tucking the remote control into her arms, [Qin Shunli] immediately stood up, walked to the TV, and turned it off.
0:23:42|0:23:50|His father, look at your son, who has already entered dreamland, was called up. He turned around, glanced at his son, and then smiled.
0:24:21|0:24:31|[The mother] watched as the group of people trying to hold back their laughter walked away angrily, then walked over to her son and threw the remote control at him.
0:25:12|0:25:14|[Qin Shunxin] looked at the two of them and pointed at Lin Muzi, speaking.
0:25:51|0:25:56|The four of them closed the car doors and set off towards home. Inside the car, [Qin Shunxin] spoke up and asked.
0:26:41|0:26:50|This is [Mother] turning her head to see [Li Muzi] returning with her daughter. She carefully scrutinizes her from head to toe, then gives a look of disdain.
0:27:45|0:27:47|The actions are synchronized, and their expressions become sorrowful.
0:28:12|0:28:14|[Qin Shunyi] turned around and went back to the kitchen.
0:31:43|0:31:51|After [Li Muzi] finished speaking, the whole family was stunned.
0:32:11|0:32:15|[The mother] frowned and looked at [Qin Shunyi] accusingly.
0:32:40|0:32:44|Tong Tong looked at the two confronting individuals and said to [Li Mu Zi].
0:33:41|0:33:48|Watching, drinking, and eating at the same time, they are very interesting.
0:34:9|0:34:11|[Father] arranged for [Li Muzi] to go out, [Qin Shunxin] looked at the two of them by the river and spoke.
0:34:30|0:34:36|After speaking, [Qin Shunyi] turned around, picked up her bag and left. [Mother] sat angrily on the chair, then turned the artillery towards [Qin Shunyi] again, and started to reprimand her.
0:35:21|0:35:27|The person who was full of anger, [Qin Shunli], returned home dejectedly. Holding his stomach, he spoke to [Qin Shunli].
0:35:40|0:35:48|After speaking, Qianzhu stood up, poured wine for [Qin Shunli], and [Qin Shunli] sat on the chair, drinking one cup after another in a gloomy mood.
0:35:59|0:36:5|On the other side, Zhu Wensheng, who returned home first, was anxiously pacing around at home, finally waiting for Qin Shunyi to return.
0:36:35|0:36:41|[Qin Shunli] raised his glass and drank it all, while [Qin Shunyi] took a sip and watched his brother disperse.
0:37:34|0:37:48|[Qin Shunyi] didn't expect that just by saying a few words, [Mother] would actually slam the plate on the ground. With a wry smile, [Qin Shunli] spoke up. [Mother] was knitting on the sofa, and Qianzhu walked up with a smile and said.
0:37:58|0:38:2|Qin Shunyi also picked up the wine glass and drank it all in one gulp.
0:38:32|0:38:39|He trembled as he picked up the wine glass and continued to pour. On the other side, [Qin Shunyi] and [Li Muzi] walked out.
0:39:3|0:39:9|[Qin Shunyi] finished speaking and then turned and walked away, leaving [Li Muzi] standing alone on the street, holding his luggage, looking dazed.
0:39:47|0:39:51|[Qin Shunxin] slowly opened his eyes and looked at [Mother]. Upon hearing this, [Mother] walked to the vase and said reluctantly.
0:41:10|0:41:25|[Qin Shunyi] looked at [Mother] with a smug expression, feeling so happy that she could hardly contain her laughter. The receptionist watched as the manager entered the company, and then the supervisor came out shortly after. The receptionist bowed and greeted them. Whenever the manager or supervisor passed by, the receptionist would greet them, but when it was [Li Muzi]'s turn to come out, there was only a cold snort.
0:43:43|0:43:50|Shunyi had no choice but to go and cook first. At the dining table, [Qin Shunyi] and Tongtong sat together gnawing on chicken legs. Just as [Mother] was about to sit down, [Qin Shunyi] spoke up.
0:44:26|0:44:28|Shunyi looked outside, hesitating to speak.
0:44:46|0:45:4|[Zhu Wensheng] was stunned when he heard this, not saying a word. Unable to bear it, [Mother] looked up and glared at [Qin Shunxin], who also refused to back down and immediately returned the glare. The two of them then began a silent confrontation. In the end, [Mother] was the one who gave in, bowing her head and quietly eating. She took a bite, then spat it out, just as she was about to speak.
0:45:4|0:45:6|Qin Shunyi, who also spat it out, spoke up.
0:45:46|0:46:13|I know you have been clever and likable since childhood, but don't forget that I, your sister who is only half an hour older than you, have been taking care of you while our parents were busy. As I said this, my sister started to choke up. [Zhu Wensheng] looked at her with a heart full of pity and said, "I helped you with laundry and took care of you. It's because you are so clueless." [Qin Shunyi] took a sip of wine and said slowly, "This is called division of labor in society." Alright, that's enough." After saying this, [Qin Shunyi] lowered her head.
0:47:0|0:47:2|On the other side, the hostess said to [Qin Shunli],
0:47:14|0:47:16|Seeing the master leaning happily on [Qin Shunli], on the other side, [Qin Shunyi] looked at [Father] and said,
0:47:45|0:47:49|[Qin Shunyi] passed by from the side, bent over, just about to sit down, when [Qin Shunli] spoke up.
0:51:27|0:51:33|After speaking, [Qin Shunli's mother] helped Qianzhu walk away. At this moment, [Qin Shunyi's father] ran over and said.
0:52:25|0:52:27|On the other side of the table, [Qin Shunxin] watched the couple enjoying their meal.
0:53:29|0:53:32|[The mother] gave [Qin Shunyi] a stern look and said.
0:55:53|0:56:2|A meal made [Mother] sweat profusely, she wiped her sweat and looked around, saying. Suddenly, Qin Shunyi felt a sharp pain, interrupting the conversation. [Mother and son] quickly called an ambulance and took Qin Shunyi to the hospital.
0:56:22|0:56:25|[Qin Shunli] happened to walk to the door and overheard the conversation.
0:57:10|0:57:16|[Qin Shunli] listened to Qianzhu's words at the door, slowly lowered her head, and her eyes became moist.
0:58:52|0:59:8|After hearing this, [Father] sat down with a pale face, and the man brought back by [Qin Shunyi] spoke again. Upon hearing this, [Father] nodded with his mouth open, while [Mother] turned her face away in disgust.
1:0:3|1:0:14|In the company, [Li Muzi] arrived early at the empty meeting room. He placed the documents on each seat one by one, rehearsing in advance.
1:0:17|1:0:21|The screen was looking down at the documents, completely unaware that his colleagues were coming up behind him one by one.
1:0:45|1:0:50|[Li Muzi] looked attentively at the script, completely unaware of the crowd behind him, and then spoke:
1:1:2|1:1:5|The scene shifts, [Qin Shunyi] accompanies [Mother] to the shopping mall.
1:2:4|1:2:9|At night, the mother and daughter were lying in bed when [the mother] suddenly spoke.
1:2:43|1:2:48|[Qin Shunyi] looked at the coat in his hand, not reacting for a moment, then put it on.
1:3:23|1:3:26|Qin Shunli and Qin Shunyi were thrilled when they opened the door and saw their home beautifully renovated by the new tenant.
1:4:39|1:4:44|Early in the morning, [Mother] came to [Qin Shunyi]'s bedroom with flowers, threw the flowers away, and frowned.
1:5:2|1:5:7|In the evening, [Qin Shunyi] brought another man back. He came to the sofa, took out a handkerchief, cleared his throat before sitting down.
1:8:6|1:8:11|When Qin Shunli left, it felt like the world was falling apart.
1:10:59|1:11:10|In the company, the secretary placed a document in front of [Li Muzi] and said.
1:11:19|1:11:25|[Li Muzi] looked at everyone, shrugged helplessly. On the other side, [Qin Shunli] and his group returned home panting, the three of them exhausted and plopped down on the sofa.
1:11:50|1:12:3|Building supported his waist with one hand and took out a property certificate from his bag with the other hand. He glanced at [Qin Shunli] and sat down, smiling.
1:12:44|1:12:50|[Qin Shunli]'s mother stopped halfway through her sentence, frowned heavily, sighed deeply, and then continued.
1:14:46|1:14:51|[Qin Shunli's Mother] grabbed [Qin Shunyi], who was about to leave, and whispered a few words in her ear.
1:15:6|1:15:10|At the dining table, people hurriedly picked up food with their chopsticks.
1:16:32|1:16:34|[Qin Shunyi] put down the chopsticks, turned around and left. [Mother] looked at [Qin Shunyi] with a furrowed brow, snatched the wine glass from [Father]'s hand, and drank it all in one gulp.
1:17:3|1:17:21|In the dance studio, a group of hot girls in tight outfits are swaying their waists, practicing the dance repeatedly. They are smiling and sweating, seemingly tireless. Suddenly, [Boss Quan] quietly enters through the back door. She takes off her sunglasses, looks up and down at the girls, making clicking sounds with her mouth.
1:22:14|1:22:25|[Qin Shunxin] shed tears in grievance, rushed out the door, leaving [Mother] at a loss for a moment. In the blink of an eye, outside the restaurant, [Qin Shunyi] helped the celebrity walk out.
1:22:34|1:22:45|The two arrived at the first stop, a hair salon, where under the stylist's hands, [Qin Shunli]'s hair was styled in various ways, sometimes up, sometimes down, sometimes curled, changing into ten different hairstyles.
1:22:45|1:22:54|In the second stop, they arrived at a clothing store. [Mother] changed more than ten outfits in one go, while [Qin Shunyi] patiently picked out clothes one by one until they were both satisfied with their choices.
1:22:59|1:23:18|I arrived home, [Qin Shunyi] pushed the well-dressed [mother] in front of [father]. [Father] put down the newspaper and slowly looked up, his mouth hanging open in shock. [Mother] stood there looking pleased, while [father] stood up, walked around [mother], and couldn't stop exclaiming in amazement.
1:23:51|1:24:8|The scene shifts, [Qin Shunyi][Zhu Wensheng] arrived at the Xishan School in Fujian, where the school playground was filled with a dense crowd of young spectators. They were dressed in clean and tidy school uniforms, sitting neatly on small stools, attentively watching the performance on stage.
1:24:8|1:24:18|On stage, [Qin Shunyi] is wearing a beautiful traditional costume, twisting gracefully while performing the yangko dance. She skillfully twirls the handkerchief in her hand, making it look lively and dynamic.
1:24:19|1:24:33|In the next moment, Qin Shunyi unleashed a powerful move, effortlessly performing a backflip that caused the audience to scream in excitement, with applause filling the air. After the performance, Qin Shunyi stood on the two corners of the stage, and the host presented her with a large trophy.
1:25:16|1:25:25|Tongtong, back home, stood in front of the timer, performing hand-switching tricks for everyone.
1:27:40|1:27:45|Time flies, and in the blink of an eye, we arrive at the Three Provinces of the Ming Dynasty. Fireworks are set off in every household, and the family of [Qin Shunyi] is also gathered together.
1:28:54|1:28:59|[Qin Shunyi] noticed something was wrong, turned around, and found [Qin Shunli] standing beside her.
