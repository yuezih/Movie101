0:0:16|0:0:33|With the sound of the telegraph, the time came to 1931. Japan brazenly launched the September 18th Incident, causing the Northeast to fall and North China to be in urgent need. Chiang Kai-shek adopted a policy of non-resistance and crazily encircled the Red Army. The Communist Party of China was forced to go underground, and the underground party in Liucheng, North China, faced an unprecedented life-and-death test.
0:0:34|0:0:53|At night, Lao Gui was using a camera to document files when he suddenly looked up and saw [Lu Xiao] pointing a gun at him. He gestured for [Lu Xiao] to look behind him, and at that moment, Lao Gui swiftly grabbed the gun from [Lu Xiao], reversed it to the ground, and used his foot to trip [Lu Xiao] over.
0:0:53|0:0:58|As soon as Hong Zichen realized that the old ghost had run out, he immediately picked up the pistol and turned to chase after him.
0:1:2|0:1:19|A small car slowly drove into the gate of the Nationalist Army Corps. Inside the courtyard, soldiers marched in neat formation. The car stopped in front of the corps building, where the commander, Che Zhenshan, was waiting. Then, [Lu Xiao] got out of the passenger seat and walked over to Che Zhenshan's side. Che Zhenshan looked into the car and nodded.
0:1:23|0:1:34|Lu Xiao gets out of the car at the entrance of the school campus, crossing his arms in front of his chest and looking around. [Che Linlin] smiles and salutes to him, and he raises his hand in return.
0:1:50|0:1:52|The group then walked towards the building.
0:2:27|0:2:35|At this moment, the screen shows the movie title "Special Mission", with the man [Hong Zichen] walking side by side with Che Linlin at the front, followed by [Lu Xiao].
0:3:20|0:3:24|At this moment, [Che Linlin] walked out of the meeting room, slamming the door angrily.
0:3:30|0:3:36|[Che Linlin] watched as [Hong Zichen] began to reminisce. Outside the house, a woman was begging in the snow, with [Hong Zichen] also present.
0:5:10|0:5:19|Che Linlin's nodding motion came to a halt, as everyone stared thoughtfully at Hong Zichen. Hong Zichen calmly sat up straight, crossing his hands on the table.
0:5:38|0:5:40|[Hong Zichen] raised the wine glass.
0:5:44|0:5:54|[Hong Zichen] smiled and raised a toast to [Che Linlin]. [Che Linlin] splashed the wine on her face. Mo Han stood still with a wine glass in hand. Everyone present was speechless. The scene then shifted to [Che Linlin]'s room.
0:7:7|0:7:26|At this moment, [Che Linlin] was crying heavily, shaking her head as she walked towards the door by the mountain. Only [Che Linlin] was left standing still, memories piercing her heart like a sharp knife. She let the tears slide down her face, turned around, and her powerless hands swayed with her body.
0:7:37|0:7:40|The scene shows the Japanese committing a crime.
0:8:12|0:8:17|Mo Han seemed lost in thought, then suddenly stood up.
0:8:39|0:8:58|[Che Linlin] turned around, the mirror was empty with no one in sight. Mo Han, who was behind her, had disappeared. A military officer was coming out of the second-floor office. Mo Han quickly hid in a compartment at the bottom of the stairs. After the officer walked away, he swiftly dashed up the stairs, ran to the second floor, and tiptoed towards the door of the office.
0:8:58|0:9:15|He moved lightly and swiftly, taking big strides while still looking back around him. He lowered his body, slowed down his pace as he approached the confidential room. He glanced back again, making sure no one was following before continuing forward. The windows around him seemed like pairs of eyes, staring at him breathlessly.
0:10:0|0:10:16|After Station Shan finished laughing, he went downstairs with [Hong Zichen] randomly. With a bow, [Hong Zichen] put a piece of paper into his pocket and walked towards the telephone booth behind him. Pedestrians kept coming and going at the door, he dialed a number, his eyes occasionally glancing outside the door, the moment of waiting felt as long as a century.
0:10:20|0:10:48|He had no expression on his face, holding a headset in his left hand, slightly lowering his head and lowering his voice. The tour guide behind him was greeting guests, his eyes unusually alert, the fleeting shadows of pedestrians constantly flickering in his eyes. In the room, a map was slowly unfolded, and a group of people gathered around the table.
0:11:1|0:11:4|The scene changes, and the soldiers stand in a row.
0:11:31|0:11:33|[Hong Zichen] is holding his stomach and frowning.
0:11:37|0:11:54|The scene shifts, Muhan prepares to push open the toilet door, but hesitates, pacing back and forth at the door. Suddenly, he remembers something, then strides towards a room. Inside the room, there is only a table, a few chairs, and some old newspapers. On the table sits a telephone.
0:11:54|0:12:11|Muhan opened the door, his eyes searching for a moment before he walked quietly towards the phone. He turned around and closed the door. After making sure no one was around, he took a quick step to the table, picked up the phone, dialed the rotary dial, and anxiously waited for the other end to pick up while glancing back.
0:12:11|0:12:19|At this moment, [Mo Han] clutched the phone receiver as if grasping a lifeline, his brow furrowed and his expression stiff.
0:12:25|0:12:41|Che Linlin glanced at her watch, showing an impatient expression. Lu Xiao listened to the instructions and immediately headed towards the direction of the restroom. Meanwhile, Hong Zichen was still anxiously waiting. In the room, Hong Zichen weakly put down the receiver, she lowered her head, frowned in thought, and tightly gripped the phone with both hands.
0:12:41|0:12:51|Suddenly, she turned around and immediately hid behind the cabinet at the door. At this moment, [Lu Xiao] kept searching for her and soon arrived at the entrance of the restroom.
0:12:55|0:13:0|The video showed no response, so [Hong Zichen] forcefully opened the restroom door, prohibiting entry into the restroom.
0:13:2|0:13:19|Lu Xiao entered the restroom, but still no one responded. He opened the door of the first cubicle, finding it empty. Then he turned to the second door, but [Che Linlin] was nowhere to be seen. He reached for the third door, and upon opening it, it was also empty.
0:13:19|0:13:38|With a furrowed brow, [Hong Zichen] pulled out a handgun from his pocket and rushed towards the outside of the restroom. He held the gun in his right hand, supporting it with his left hand, vigilantly scanning the surroundings. Suddenly, he opened the door of the small room. He entered the room and slowly walked towards the inside. Just as he aimed the gun into the room.
0:14:10|0:14:23|Upon entering the restroom, [Hong Zichen] leaned against the wall and took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down. Suddenly, he pulled out a handgun, checked the magazine, chambered a round, gripped the gun with both hands, and slowly walked towards the window.
0:14:23|0:14:30|Later, he looked out the window and saw [Che Linlin] pacing back and forth downstairs. [Hong Zichen] raised his gun and aimed at the ground below.
0:15:0|0:15:6|[Hong Zichen] peeked through the crack in the door at the soldiers outside and the animation of [Lu Xiao]. Then, she pushed open the door to the restroom.
0:15:49|0:16:6|In the hospital, nurses and doctors were in chaos. [Hong Zichen] and [Lu Xiao] quickly climbed the hospital steps and hurried to the second floor ward. They then walked through a narrow and long corridor with walls half-covered in redwood. Finally, the two arrived at the door of the ward.
0:16:17|0:16:22|[Hong Zichen] covered his face and cried loudly, while the people gathered in front of the door looked at him in shock.
0:16:24|0:16:38|Finally, [Hong Zichen] and [Che Linlin] walked into the ward together. [Hong Zichen] covered his face, observing the special envoy lying on the hospital bed. At this moment, the special envoy was wrapped in bandages all over his body. He had an oxygen tube inserted, his eyes staring straight at the ceiling.
0:16:38|0:16:50|Mo Han walked to the bedside, reaching for the gun at his waist, while stealing glances at the reaction of the person behind him. He approached the bed, crouched down, and looked at the special agent who was in a critical condition.
0:17:49|0:17:54|[Che Linlin] and [Lu Xiao] left the ward, Mo Han watched them leave and then turned around.
0:18:1|0:18:24|Mo Han slowly approached the bedside, his eyes becoming more and more fierce. The special envoy on the bed desperately tried to speak, but only saw Mo Han getting closer. Doctors and nurses rushed in first, followed closely by [Che Linlin] and [Lu Xiao]. They anxiously gathered around the hospital bed.
0:18:47|0:18:51|Mo Han knelt down in front of Che Zhenshan, and the scene shifted to a soldier running towards the Legion Building.
0:19:36|0:19:50|Lu Xiao led the soldiers out. Mo Han looked back at them, stayed in place, and then walked towards the building. The soldiers drove out of the legion gate and headed towards the distance in a grand manner. At this moment, Mo Han was making a phone call, feeling anxious and restless.
0:19:59|0:20:22|Following that, [Hong Zichen] rode a military motorcycle, speeding along the winding roads of Yangcheng. The road was surrounded by dense forests and wild grasslands. In the distance, [Lu Xiao] and the soldiers were galloping towards them, [Hong Zichen] chased after them. Subsequently, [Hong Zichen] blocked the path of [Lu Xiao] and the others.
0:20:51|0:20:57|Lu Xiao got off the car and grabbed Mo Han's arm, a gold bar fell to the ground, and they stopped pulling each other.
0:21:13|0:21:26|As soon as the words fell, [Lu Xiao] pointed the gun at Mo Han. Then, a small car drove up from behind and stopped next to them. A man got out of the passenger seat, and to their surprise, it was [Che Linlin].
0:21:30|0:21:37|[Che Linlin] slapped [Lu Xiao] in the face. [Lu Xiao] was stunned by the blow.
0:21:42|0:21:53|Che Linlin turned around and walked towards the depths of the forest, with Mo Han closely following him, both walking cautiously. The surrounding weeds were about half a person tall.
0:22:7|0:22:12|At this moment, a group of bandits with guns suddenly emerged from the bushes, their faces covered.
0:22:15|0:22:22|Che Linlin quickly saw the situation and hurriedly put down the gun with Mo Han, slowly crouching down and throwing the gun on the ground.
0:22:42|0:22:48|The bandit then turned around and walked into the woods behind with two of his henchmen. [Che Linlin] and [Mo Han] stood still, staring at them.
0:22:51|0:22:57|In the distance, the bandits are holding Lingling hostage. Lingling is tied up and gagged with a list of names stuffed in her mouth.
0:22:58|0:23:5|Said [Mo Han], turned back to look at Che Zhenshan, nodded, and walked up the hill with the wrapped gold in hand.
0:23:6|0:23:9|The bandits pointed their guns at him, and he threw the gold out.
0:23:14|0:23:30|At this moment, the bandits brought Lingling out. Lingling kept shaking and struggling, being pushed by the bandits. [Mo Han] borrowed strength, raised his hands and walked towards Lingling. The bandits stared at her intently. Then, he walked to Lingling's side and pulled out the cloth stuffed in her mouth.
0:23:33|0:23:55|Following that, [Mo Han] took Lingling from the bandits and held her close, preparing to leave. A bandit aimed a gun at them. Suddenly, [Lu Xiao] fired a few shots from a distance, leading to an intense gunfight between the bandits and [Lu Xiao]. Mo Han and Lingling quickly raised their bodies, while [Che Linlin] nearby also crouched down.
0:23:55|0:24:10|A grenade was thrown by the bandits, and in an instant, sparks flew in the bushes. The bandits were forced to retreat one after another. Just as the bandit leader was about to retreat, he suddenly fell to the ground. As he slowly got up, he looked up and saw Mo Han fleeing with fragments scattered around.
0:24:16|0:24:32|[Lu Xiao] shot down the leader of the bandits, while at this moment Mo Han also fell heavily on the grass. Her eyes were lifeless, staring at the sky, feeling her body unusually heavy as if she had been hung with a sign, while the bandits in the distance were still fighting with the soldiers.
0:24:32|0:24:40|The scene shifts, Mo Han lies quietly on a bed, trying to open her mouth to speak but unable to muster any strength. Then, [Che Linlin] rushes in.
0:24:44|0:24:48|Ling Ling gazed at Mo Han's weak face, squatting down and leaning over the edge of the bed.
0:25:21|0:25:24|At this moment, [Che Linlin] welled up with tears.
0:25:48|0:25:54|[Lu Xiao] had tears in the corners of his eyes as he turned and walked away. [Che Linlin] sat down and called out to him.
0:26:37|0:26:41|[Che Linlin] stopped and stood up after a moment of contemplation.
0:26:52|0:27:7|Che Linlin walked behind Lu Xiao, put on a military cap, and walked towards the door. Lu Xiao stood still, his eyes becoming more fierce. In the hospital, Lingling sat by the bed feeding congee to the severely injured Mo Han. Mo Han couldn't move, he could only slightly open his mouth and drink the congee.
0:27:15|0:27:23|He leaned towards Yu Xuan's face. Yu Xuan pushed him away and looked at his face. He looked a bit weak and could only nod with pursed lips.
0:27:27|0:27:46|She looked into Hong Zichen's eyes, which were like flowing water, full of reluctance as she turned away. She stood still, and Hong Zichen quickly came up and hugged her from behind. In this era of war, parting meant farewell forever. Even though their love was deep and sincere at this moment, tears streaming down like rain, they could not resist the arrangement of fate.
0:27:47|0:27:52|Mo Han opened his eyes, at this moment, [Che Linlin] was wiping her cheeks with a towel, she shook her head.
0:27:58|0:28:0|Lingling's eye sockets were wet with tears.
0:28:7|0:28:10|Mo smiled weakly.
0:28:34|0:28:47|[Che Linlin] wiped away the tears on her face after hearing, then continued to pick up the porridge by the bed and fed it to Mo Han. In a moment, [Lu Xiao] walked in and stood still in front of the scene.
0:28:53|0:28:56|[Lu Xiao] looks down at Mo Han with a cold gaze. [Lu Xiao] withdraws his hands.
0:29:30|0:29:35|[Lu Xiao] discreetly points at Lingling with his hand, shows a hesitant expression, then turns around and leaves.
0:29:46|0:29:52|Lingling held a bowl and turned away from the bed, with [Che Linlin] sitting next to Mo Han, smiling.
0:30:27|0:30:30|Che Linlin and Lu Xiao stared at each other seriously.
0:30:50|0:30:56|[Che Linlin] looked up, his hands supporting his chin in contemplation.
0:31:0|0:31:8|On the other side, Linlin was in her room, looking through a stack of documents at the table, while Mohan lay on the small bed behind her.
0:31:10|0:31:15|Mo Han looked at the back of [Che Linlin], her bed placed side by side with [Che Linlin]'s bed.
0:31:25|0:31:36|[Che Linlin] sat at the table without turning around, writing something sparsely. Seeing this, Mo Han was anxious to get up, but the pain prevented him from moving, so he could only raise his head and lie down in pain.
0:31:41|0:31:46|[Che Linlin] immediately stopped the pen in her hand, lifted the blanket covering Mo Han, and slowly helped him up.
0:31:51|0:32:2|But when Mo Han sat up, [Che Linlin] squatted down to help her put on her shoes. At this moment, Mo Han's eyes were fixed on the table beside her. Then, [Che Linlin] helped her up and they walked towards the restroom.
0:32:2|0:32:9|Just as he reached the table, Mo Han looked at the documents on the table, a gun suddenly fell down next to the table, and [Che Linlin] quickly rushed to support her.
0:32:16|0:32:26|Shortly after, [Che Linlin] supported Mo Han as they walked towards the restroom. Although Mo Han was walking, his eyes were still fixed on the table, and he even turned back to take another look. [Che Linlin] helped Mo Han into the restroom.
0:32:34|0:32:40|The soldier walked towards the table with the porridge. "I'll do it." Then, she spilled the porridge onto the table.
0:32:47|0:33:3|Next, [Che Linlin] hurriedly used her hands to clean up the spilled porridge. Just as she anxiously ran towards the restroom, Mo Han suddenly came out from inside. Mo Han glanced at the documents before turning around. In front of the legion gate, Mo Han walked out from the courtyard and greeted the soldiers at the entrance.
0:33:3|0:33:14|At this moment, [Lu Xiao] is observing them from a distance with binoculars. She then puts down the binoculars.
0:33:29|0:33:31|At this moment, Mo Han was also making a phone call.
0:33:48|0:34:7|When he hung up the phone and looked towards the door, a man suddenly hid. After a moment of thought, he walked towards the door, passing by a porter pulling a yellow cart on the way. He stopped, turned back to look around, with only a few pedestrians on the street. He turned back and paused for a moment before continuing to walk forward.
0:34:7|0:34:13|In the next scene, amidst the flowers, [Lu Xiao] and [Che Linlin] sit side by side, surrounded by blossoms.
0:34:47|0:34:58|Shortly after, [Lu Xiao] took over the heart-shaped pendant. [Che Linlin] turned around, and [Lu Xiao] put it on her from behind. [Che Linlin] fixed her hair and leaned on [Lu Xiao]'s shoulder.
0:35:12|0:35:14|[Lu Xiao] faces [Che Linlin].
0:35:24|0:35:27|Mo Han lowered his head, at a loss.
0:35:57|0:36:18|Lingling smiled slightly, stood up and ran happily towards the distance, leaving Mo Han sitting alone in place. The scene shifted, Mo Han walked down the street in plain clothes, with someone secretly following behind. As Mo Han turned his head, the figure immediately disappeared again. Mo Han paused for a moment, then ran off at a corner. He crossed the street.
0:36:18|0:36:34|Running down a long alley. Soon after, the figure also quickened his pace and caught up. The camera zoomed in, revealing the figure to be [Lu Xiao]. [Lu Xiao] looked towards the pitch-black depths of the alley, then glanced around cautiously, carefully moving forward.
0:36:34|0:36:38|His shadow kept stretching, a thin layer of sweat forming on his forehead. 
0:36:40|0:36:59|Suddenly, his right leg was tripped by someone, [Lu Xiao] fell to the ground, [Hong Zichen] grabbed his neck from behind. [Hong Zichen] clenched his teeth, gently lifted his hands, [Lu Xiao] was pinned down and unable to move. [Hong Zichen] slowly released his hands, lowered his head to carefully examine the man beneath him.
0:36:59|0:37:4|[Lu Xiao] lay on the ground, turned his head to look at [Hong Zichen], while [Hong Zichen] stared blankly at [Lu Xiao].
0:37:8|0:37:15|After [Hong Zichen] stood up, [Lu Xiao] also got up, still holding a gun in his hand.
0:37:28|0:37:32|[Lu Xiao] holds a gun up to [Hong Zichen].
0:37:45|0:37:47|[Hong Zichen] blocked [Lu Xiao]'s gun.
0:38:1|0:38:3|[Lu Xiao] raised the gun again.
0:38:29|0:38:34|[Lu Xiao] gestured for [Hong Zichen] to leave with the gun in his hand. Without any hesitation, [Hong Zichen] turned around and left.
0:39:2|0:39:8|Hong Zichen and Che Linlin embraced each other joyfully, their faces beaming with tears of happiness.
0:39:13|0:39:19|At this moment, [Che Linlin] suddenly let go of her hands, put away the smile on her face, and looked at [Hong Zichen].
0:40:6|0:40:13|[Hong Zichen] frowned. At this moment, [Che Linlin] wiped off the salt sculpture on her face.
0:40:22|0:40:25|Please see, tears once again wet the eyes of [Hong Zichen].
0:40:30|0:40:35|[Lu Xiao] turned his face to the side and then walked towards the side.
0:40:51|0:41:4|[Hong Zichen] turned around, staring blankly ahead. [Che Linlin] gazed at [Hong Zichen] from behind as he reached into his pocket, taking out a heart-shaped pendant. He then turned to face [Che Linlin], his lips trembling.
0:41:9|0:41:19|She blinked back tears, turned to look tenderly at [Che Linlin], then reached out her hands to put a necklace on [Che Linlin], who leaned forward in response.
0:41:32|0:41:35|Tears also washed [Che Linlin]'s eyes.
0:41:50|0:41:52|Yuxuan couldn't bear to stare at [Mo Han].
0:41:57|0:42:8|[Lu Xiao] turned and left. At that moment, Yuxuan stepped forward and pulled out a strand of hair from the back of [Lu Xiao]'s head. The tears in her eyes shimmered like stars in the sea, and her trembling lips looked especially desolate.
0:42:10|0:42:29|[Lu Xiao] gritted her teeth, turned her back on [Che Linlin], and watched as Liu Yuxuan walked away. Liu Yuxuan stood alone, staring at her retreating figure, her hand still gently shaking the strands of hair, but her heart was already in tatters. At this moment, [Lu Xiao] walked out of the room in a daze, each step feeling like lead in her shoes, making it difficult for her to move forward.
0:42:29|0:42:33|She walked around the corner, raised her eyes and saw [Che Linlin] standing right in front of her.
0:42:34|0:42:39|At this moment, [Che Linlin] is burning with anger, still wearing the same heart-shaped necklace around her neck.
0:43:23|0:43:34|[Lu Xiao] went forward to chase, but was hit on the wound by [Che Linlin]. She bent over in pain, covering the wound. When [Che Linlin] saw this, she covered her face with her hands and couldn't help but burst into tears.
0:43:51|0:43:57|Mo Han hugged [Che Linlin], letting her pound on his injured chest.
0:44:9|0:44:22|Mo Han pulled [Che Linlin] and looked back at her. [Che Linlin] stood still, bowing her head and breathing heavily, like a child who had made a mistake in a hurry. Mo Han walked up to her and put the heart-shaped necklace back around her neck.
0:44:22|0:44:31|[Che Linlin] looked up and gazed at the man in front of her. Seeing the wounds on his chest that she had never noticed before, she felt a pang of sadness, and tears welled up in her eyes.
0:44:32|0:44:43|Shortly after, Mo Han held [Che Linlin]'s hand and walked towards room 305. The two pushed open the door and walked inside. The room was dimly lit, with [Che Linlin] walking in front and Mo Han following behind.
0:44:47|0:44:59|Mo Han took a careful look and saw that the window behind the curtain was wide open. She quickly stepped forward to pull the curtain tight, then faced [Che Linlin] with her hands hidden behind her back. Seeing that [Che Linlin] had not noticed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
0:45:25|0:45:32|If Lu Xiao knew I was smoking, [Che Linlin] frowned suspiciously at [Mo Han], a hint of worry flashing in her eyes.
0:45:34|0:45:36|[Che Linlin] lowered her eyes.
0:45:40|0:45:48|Later, she looked up at [Hong Zichen] and then turned around to leave. [Hong Zichen] glanced at the curtains behind him and also walked away quickly.
0:46:54|0:47:1|The scene shifts to a room where [Hong Zichen] unbuttons his shirt and drinks alone. He sets down the glass and looks across.
0:47:7|0:47:10|[Che Linlin] sat across, motionless.
0:47:11|0:47:26|It's just that being suspicious, [Hong Zichen] poured himself another glass of wine, then drank it all in one gulp. [Che Linlin] leaned back in the chair, staring blankly at the ceiling, with both hands hanging on the armrests of the chair.
0:47:55|0:47:58|Lingling stared straight at herself in the mirror.
0:48:47|0:48:58|[Lu Xiao] lifted his leg and knocked Mo Han to the ground. [Lu Xiao] and a group of people started beating Mo Han, who writhed in pain on the ground. Suddenly, Lingling stood up and pulled out a handgun.
0:49:0|0:49:4|Lingling pointed a gun at [Lu Xiao], and everyone stopped beating Mo Han.
0:49:27|0:49:42|Shortly after, [Lu Xiao] led the soldiers out of the room, while Lingling still pointed the gun at them. Mo Han curled up on the ground after being beaten, and Lingling collapsed on the floor. Outside the window, a full moon hung in the sky, while tears streamed down Lingling's face inside the room.
0:49:47|0:50:7|The scene shifts, Mo Han turned over in bed and found himself holding Linlin beside him. He suddenly woke up from his dream, sat up in bed and looked at Linlin. Linlin held his hand tightly, sleeping soundly. He gently withdrew his hand, sat on the bed for a moment, then turned to sit on the edge of the bed, fiddling with his hands and feet to put on his shoes.
0:50:7|0:50:16|He looked towards the cabinet and sofa on the side, got up quietly and walked towards the cabinet, fumbled for a moment, then turned towards the sofa, where a book wrapped in clothes lay.
0:50:17|0:50:31|He slowly unbuttoned his shirt, took out the book inside, and at the same time, he didn't forget to turn his head to look at the sleeping [Che Linlin]. Then, Mo Han took the book and hid in the bathroom. He immediately turned on the bathroom light, turned around and sat on the toilet, flipping through the contents of the book.
0:50:36|0:50:51|He quickly flipped through the contents of the book, his panicked eyes filled with unease. The densely packed words in the book occupied his entire field of vision, and his eyes could no longer leave the pages. His hands trembled slightly as he held the book, the words dancing in his eyes.
0:50:53|0:51:10|He sat silently on the toilet, flipping through a book without stopping, letting time pass by bit by bit. Then, he returned to the bedroom and rummaged through boxes and cabinets by the bed. At that moment, the sleeping [Che Linlin] woke up, opened her eyes, and looked at [Hong Zichen].
0:51:11|0:51:13|[Hong Zichen] looked up in panic.
0:51:25|0:51:44|After speaking, [Che Linlin] turned her head and fell asleep, while [Hong Zichen] then turned around and left. The scene shifted to inside the post office, where [Hong Zichen] picked up the phone and waited for a call. With smoke rising, [Hong Zichen] stood by the phone, surrounded by bustling traffic outside and various packages piled up inside the post office.
0:51:44|0:51:50|Afterwards, she turned the dial again, but there was still no answer on the other end of the line.
0:51:51|0:52:9|Hong Zichen couldn't help but furrow his brow in confusion, the sunlight casting a faint wrinkle at the corner of his eyes. His features appeared more rugged and upright against the backdrop of shadows. Holding the receiver in his left hand, his jaw slightly retracted, a hint of imperceptible fear flashed in his eyes. He then hung up the phone and strode out the door.
0:52:11|0:52:30|Following that, he walked down a small path to a shop with a sign at the entrance indicating poor management. The scene then gradually blurred, revealing a contact a week later, with Wind Chime Road being the location of the large pharmacy. Mo Han immediately ran to the nearby window, pressed against it to look inside, then turned around and walked towards the entrance.
0:52:30|0:52:36|As he furrowed his brow in thought, he looked up and saw a shifty-eyed man rushing towards him.
0:52:37|0:52:48|The scene begins with a flashback, showing Mo Hanchu first meeting the man who was tied up. Back to reality, the man stares at Mo Han.
0:53:2|0:53:4|Mo Han ran away, with the man chasing after him.
0:54:15|0:54:25|As soon as the words fell, Hong Zichen kept turning his small eyes, thinking. Then a smirk appeared on his lips, and he voluntarily put away the gun in his hand.
0:54:26|0:54:33|Both sides put away their guns, then Mo Han took out a stack of banknotes and handed it to the man, who took the money.
0:54:52|0:55:2|The man turned around with the money, and Mo Han immediately pulled out a gun and pointed it at him. But not far away, [Che Linlin] was running towards this direction. Upon seeing this, Mo Han immediately ran towards [Che Linlin].
0:55:23|0:55:37|Mo Han raised his hand awkwardly to bid farewell. Lingling turned back in confusion, looking at the man with small eyes. As Mo Han looked up, a figure flashed past upstairs.
0:55:40|0:55:51|From then on, Mo Han pulled Lingling out of the alley. The camera zoomed in, and the figure upstairs was Lu Xiao, who was watching the two leave. Inside the room, Lu Xiao slammed a gold bar on the table.
0:55:58|0:56:1|The man with small eyes was instantly stunned.
0:56:23|0:56:37|The scene shifts to [Che Linlin]'s office. [Che Linlin] picks up a teacup and takes a sip. Then, she puts down the cup.
0:56:46|0:56:50|[Lu Xiao] is going to stay in place.
0:56:59|0:57:10|[Lu Xiao] turns around. Then, [Lu Xiao] leaves the office. That night, Mo Han hands a gold bar to the man with small eyes.
0:57:11|0:57:19|The man with small eyes took the gold bar and looked around. Mo Han turned to look around.
0:57:20|0:57:29|On the other side, [Che Linlin] lay on the bed, her hands slowly reaching out to the heart-shaped pendant on her chest. She touched the pendant, starting to recall what happened during the day.
0:57:36|0:57:56|Ling Ling slowly opened her eyes, the chimpanzee pendant still on her lips. Then, she put down the necklace and slowly placed her hand on her abdomen, her eyes becoming more determined. The next day, Mo Han was standing on the bustling street. She looked around and suddenly saw a man with small eyes approaching from the opposite side.
0:57:56|0:57:58|He quickly found a corner to hide in.
0:58:0|0:58:14|On the other side, [Lu Xiao] was also wandering on the street. When he saw the man with small eyes, he immediately hid in a corner to observe. The man with small eyes looked around, and when he saw [Lu Xiao] hiding, he walked away behind himself.
0:58:14|0:58:24|Pedestrians come and go on the street, with vendors setting up stalls on both sides of the street doing business. A man with small eyes stands alone on the street, while [Lu Xiao] and Mo Han observe him from a corner.
0:58:29|0:58:47|The man with small eyes fell to the ground, and [Mo Han] in the corner widened his eyes in shock. [Mo Han] looked into the distance, where Lingling was turning around and hurriedly walking into an alley. At the same time, Lingling's hand was holding something in her bag, and [Lu Xiao] also widened his eyes in amazement upon seeing Lingling's figure.
0:58:48|0:59:5|In the post office, [Mo Han] anxiously makes a phone call. He furrows his brows. A distant cousin approaches, the scene shifts to a fabric store where various patterned fabrics are displayed. [Che Linlin] picks up a piece of exquisite silk.
0:59:27|0:59:40|[Che Linlin] put down the piece of fabric and looked at other silk fabrics. Mo Han turned to look at the clock, which showed three o'clock exactly. She then turned to look behind her, and at that moment, a man walked into the shop.
0:59:44|0:59:46|The man then looked at [Che Linlin].
1:0:11|1:0:24|[Che Linlin] impatiently looked at the man, then left with Mo Han. The man stood still, his eyes fixed on them. [Che Linlin] and Mo Han walked out of the shop door and onto the bustling street. The man followed them out of the shop door, watching the direction they left in.
1:0:24|1:0:36|Shortly after, he walked up to the assistant setting up a stall in front of the store, his eyes constantly glancing towards the two figures walking away. At that moment, [Mo Han] turned to look at the man, who suddenly took a swift step and disappeared from the frame.
1:0:40|1:0:51|[Mo Han] turned around and brought Lingling to a street stall. [Mo Han] secretly looked back and saw a man hiding in the corner, arguing with [Lu Xiao] who was holding a newspaper beside him. [Mo Han] then turned back.
1:1:19|1:1:29|After [Lu Xiao] left, [Che Linlin] angrily stayed in place. Then, she picked up the phone on the table, dialed a number, and waited for the call to be answered.
1:1:36|1:2:0|[Mo Han] and Yu Xuan are meeting. Yu Xuan turns around and runs to the cabinet behind her to search for something. Mo Han stands still and waits. Yu Xuan opens a drawer and takes out two thick books. Then, she brings the books in front of Mo Han to show him. In Che Linlin's office, [Lu Xiao] walks in and immediately takes off his hat.
1:3:46|1:3:57|Shortly after, [Lu Xiao] stormed out angrily. Ling Ling stood there in a daze.
1:4:10|1:4:15|The scene shifts, and Hong Zichen stands in front of everyone at the station, looking at them solemnly.
1:4:45|1:4:48|Che Linlin nodded and then looked at Mo Han.
1:4:56|1:5:18|At the entrance of the pharmacy, Mo Han looked around before walking in. [Lu Xiao] secretly hid behind the wall, tracking Mo Han and keeping his eyes on him. A yellow van passed by, and [Lu Xiao] ducked out of sight. Later, Mo Han came out of the pharmacy, glanced around, and held two packets of medicinal herbs in his hands.
1:5:18|1:5:25|Following that, [Mo Han] left the pharmacy, [Lu Xiao] peeked out from the wall to watch [Mo Han]'s figure, standing in place with a furrowed brow.
1:5:29|1:5:31|[Che Linlin] coldly raised her head.
1:6:7|1:6:18|[Lu Xiao] strolled leisurely ahead. [Mo Han] anxiously followed behind him. [Lu Xiao] turned back, smiled, and then walked away briskly.
1:7:14|1:7:17|Che Linlin glanced up at Hong Zichen.
1:7:22|1:7:25|[Lu Xiao] then revealed a relieved smile.
1:7:53|1:8:10|[Mo Han] stood up, then sat back down in a despondent manner, his expression becoming more solemn. Within the legion, soldiers swiftly ran with their guns on their backs, then stood in orderly formation. [Lu Xiao] adjusted his collar, standing at the front of the line, ready to set off.
1:8:10|1:8:15|In the office, [Hong Zichen] turned his back and secretly wrote something on a piece of paper.
1:8:19|1:8:35|[Che Linlin] was half lying on the soft leather sofa, with her hands crossed in front of her chest and her eyes closed, a faint smile on her face. Muhan then put away the note in his hand and looked at [Che Linlin], who was already asleep on the sofa.
1:8:45|1:9:2|Shortly after, [Mo Han] stood up. At this moment, [Che Linlin] secretly opened one eye and watched [Mo Han] walk away. The soldiers were now ready to go. Military vehicles filled with people drove out of the gate of the Nationalist Army in an orderly manner. Meanwhile, [Hong Zichen] arrived at the office.
1:9:24|1:9:44|[Mo Han] hurriedly chased after. [Che Zhenshan] stood up from the sofa, quickly walked to the door, and opened it slightly to look outside. Outside, Mo Han handed a note to [Che Linlin]. [Che Zhenshan] frowned and then sat back on the sofa.
1:9:48|1:10:2|Lingling took the note from Mo Han and ran off with a smile. Che [Zhen Shan] picked up the cup slowly at this moment, frowning in contemplation. She absentmindedly sipped her tea, occasionally glancing towards the door. Soon after, Mo Han walked in through the door.
1:10:15|1:10:39|Che [Zhen Shan] put down the cup. Next, Che [Zhen Shan] leaned back on the sofa, hugging his arms and fell asleep. Mo Han looked at him, then unbuttoned his shirt, half lying on the sofa, every breath revealing worry, looking up at the ceiling. The clock pointed to twelve o'clock, and Che [Zhen Shan] was awakened by the chime.
1:10:39|1:10:47|[Che Linlin] rubbed her eyes, and at this moment [Lu Xiao] ran over and caught a female communist party member on the subway.
1:11:21|1:11:35|[Che Linlin] picked up her hat and walked away quickly, with Mo Han following closely behind. Soon, they arrived at a dimly lit prison. The prison was filled with iron chains, and the group walked through the delicate corridors to stand in front of the prisoners.
1:11:35|1:11:41|[Che Linlin] and [Lu Xiao] faced the criminal, and then Mo Han walked over to take a closer look, only to find out that the captured criminal was Yuxuan.
1:12:16|1:12:35|Mo Han took the whip tremblingly, his outstretched hand shaking slightly. Then, [Che Linlin] and [Lu Xiao] turned and walked away. Mo Han stood there holding the whip, staring blankly as they left. Suddenly, she turned around and faced Yu Xuan, who was tied up.
1:12:35|1:12:38|Yuxuan shook her head, indicating her to look up, where a bug was hidden.
1:12:40|1:12:46|At this moment, [Che Linlin] is sitting in the monitoring room, while [Mo Han] is tapping his fingers and communicating with [Yu Xuan].
1:13:0|1:13:11|They were communicating by tapping their fingers to send Morse code. Yu Xuan and Mu Han locked eyes. In the monitoring room, [Che Linlin] suddenly took off her headphones.
1:13:16|1:13:25|Che Linlin stops Lu Xiao from leaving, and the listener immediately readjusts the listening device. Che Linlin puts her headphones back on, while Lu Xiao stands to the side.
1:14:4|1:14:19|[Yuxuan] anxiously signaled to [Mohan], but [Mohan] stood still, always staring at [Yuxuan]. At this moment, outside, there was lightning and thunder, and the lightning illuminated [Mohan]'s face. [Mohan] looked up at the monitor above his head, then turned to gaze at [Yuxuan].
1:14:19|1:14:30|[Mo Han]'s eyes gradually lost their light, she stared blankly at [Yu Xuan]. At this moment, [Yu Xuan] was shouting with her mouth wide open, but [Mo Han] looked dazed, unable to hear [Yu Xuan]'s voice.
1:14:33|1:14:42|A bolt of lightning tore through the night sky, [Hong Zichen] picked up the whip blankly, repeatedly, like a heartless machine, crazily lashing at [Che Linlin].
1:14:42|1:14:55|The whip left long marks on [Hong Zichen]'s body, but [Lu Xiao] remained motionless like a corpse, mechanically repeating the actions, tears sliding down her rough skin. [Hong Zichen] closed her eyes tightly and clenched her fists.
1:14:58|1:15:4|In the monitoring room, [Che Linlin] listened carefully. Outside, amidst the wind and rain, [Che Linlin] pushed the door open.
1:15:6|1:15:12|In the monitoring room, [Che Linlin] tightened her headphones, and [Mo Han]'s whip was snatched away by [Che Linlin].
1:15:18|1:15:23|[Che Linlin] fiercely whipped [Mo Han] with a whip, then pushed [Mo Han] to the ground.
1:15:33|1:15:50|[Lingling] whipped the ground, looking at [Yuxuan] covered in bloodstains, then shifted her gaze to the heart-shaped agate necklace around her neck. She walked over, touched [Yuxuan]'s necklace, and then took it off her neck.
1:15:50|1:15:56|She held the necklace in her hand, carefully examined it, and then took out her own necklace from her neck to take a look.
1:15:59|1:16:15|At this moment, [Lu Xiao] suddenly pushed the door open. He looked at Lingling wearing a necklace that matched the one on her hand, then glanced at the unconscious Yuxuan. He narrowed his eyes, a faint, sinister smile playing on his lips, as lightning reflected on [Lu Xiao]'s face, making it look particularly eerie.
1:16:15|1:16:28|By the pond, Che Linlin stood side by side with Lu Xiao in her new qipao, while Lu Xiao slumped down in despair. The water in the pond reflected the two figures, as Che Linlin tearfully took out a necklace from her pocket.
1:16:45|1:16:50|Later, [Che Linlin] put the necklace back into her pocket, and the two of them strolled along a small path.
1:17:35|1:17:43|Taking a deep breath, [Hong Zichen] pulled out a necklace from his neck, then held the necklace and turned around to look at [Mo Han].
1:17:53|1:17:57|Lingling turned around again, with her back facing Mo Han.
1:18:30|1:18:36|Mo Han hugged Lingling tightly. Lingling was heartbroken, grieving to the point of gasping for breath.
1:18:43|1:18:47|Lingling pushed away his embrace.
1:19:14|1:19:19|[Che Linlin] quickly wiped away the tears on her face, turning her back to Mo Han and the soldiers.
1:19:24|1:19:42|[Che Linlin] nodded. Afterwards, Mo Han turned and left. The night wind messed up her hair and disturbed her thoughts. She took out the necklace from her pocket, then looked at it, holding it in her palm, covering her face and crying loudly.
1:19:42|1:19:54|[Che Linlin] couldn't help but tremble, tears wetting her eyes and soaking her shoulders. Mo Han pushed open the door and entered the office, prompting [Che Linlin] to quickly put away what she was holding.
1:21:16|1:21:22|At this moment, [Lu Xiao] was eavesdropping outside the window. He squinted his eyes, smirked cunningly, and then turned around to leave.
1:22:26|1:22:31|Che Linlin turned around and went to answer the phone.
1:22:46|1:23:1|Lingling stood still as Che Linlin hung up the phone and walked up to her. She paused, then quickly left Lingling's room. Suddenly, her door was opened and Lingling pointed a gun at the person outside, who turned out to be Hong Zichen disguised as a woman.
1:23:14|1:23:17|[Hong Zichen] puts the wig and gun on the table, then takes off the women's clothing.
1:23:25|1:23:28|Lingling cried and threw herself into [Hong Zichen]'s arms.
1:23:57|1:24:1|Lingling frowned, [Hong Zichen] turned to look at him.
1:24:44|1:24:59|Hong Zichen picked up the gun and walked out of Lingling's room. She arrived at the safe in the Legion building, shining a flashlight on it, turning the combination lock quietly. As she turned the rusty lock, she kept a close eye behind her.
1:24:59|1:25:9|As she was fully focused on picking the lock, suddenly, the light in the room was turned on. She instantly turned around and pointed the gun at the person, who turned out to be [Che Linlin].
1:25:15|1:25:17|Che Linlin points the gun at him.
1:25:21|1:25:30|[Che Linlin] had tears in her eyes, still holding the gun. Mo Han walked to the table and placed the gun on it. [Che Linlin] lowered the gun, and Mo Han nodded.
1:25:50|1:25:59|Are you not afraid of exposing yourself? In the end, [Che Linlin] raised the gun again, aiming at Mo Han's head.
1:26:20|1:26:23|Mo Han slowly approached [Che Linlin].
1:27:11|1:27:24|[Hong Zichen] lowered her eyes. Mo Han frowned and stared at her. As soon as he finished speaking, Mo Han turned and walked towards the safe. He quickly spun the combination lock.
1:27:27|1:27:29|Che Linlin lowered her head to contemplate the evidence.
1:27:35|1:27:40|She then looked at [Che Linlin] and shook her head. After some contemplation, [Che Linlin] looked at Mo Han.
1:27:44|1:27:59|After speaking, [Che Linlin] locked her gaze on the safe in front of her. [Hong Zichen] was spinning his fingers on top of it. [Che Linlin] held her breath, her eyes unusually determined. Then, the safe door opened. [Hong Zichen] turned back happily to look at [Che Linlin].
1:27:59|1:28:3|At this moment, [Che Linlin] had tears in her eyes and couldn't help but sob.
1:28:14|1:28:23|Mu Han embraced [Che Linlin] and she turned to open the safe, only to find it empty. Suddenly, [Hong Zichen] appeared with a gun.
1:28:57|1:29:0|[Che Linlin] points a gun at her own head.
1:29:8|1:29:12|Mo Han took the gun that took the spirit's life, at this moment, [Lu Xiao] couldn't walk in with the gun.
1:29:39|1:29:52|Saying that, [Lu Xiao] raised the bomb in his other hand, while Lingling hid behind Che Linlin. Both sides held their guns in a standoff. At this moment, Che Linlin slowly lowered the gun in her hand, crouched down, and placed the gun on the ground.
1:29:56|1:29:58|[Lu Xiao] points a gun at Mo Han.
1:30:15|1:30:17|[Lu Xiao] had a smug smile on his face.
1:30:21|1:30:35|Mo Han pushed Che Zhenshan and Lin Li away. He shot Lu Xiao in the abdomen, causing him to fall. Mo Han then ran out of the building with Lin Li and her father.
1:30:44|1:30:46|Che Linlin looks at Lingling.
1:31:53|1:32:0|Mo Han stood aside, turned his back to the two women, secretly wiping away tears. At this moment, [Che Linlin] suddenly looked up and gazed at Linlin.
1:32:5|1:32:7|[Che Linlin] took out the password book.
1:32:11|1:32:13|He then turned to look at Mo Han.
1:32:19|1:32:21|A tear fell from Hong Zichen's face.
1:32:53|1:33:10|Suddenly, [Lu Xiao] staggered out of the building, pointing a gun at Mo Han. Ling Ling turned around and ran to stand in front of [Hong Zichen]. A bullet hit Ling Ling's chest. Mo Han raised his gun and shot [Lu Xiao].
1:33:15|1:33:23|[Che Linlin] looked at [Lu Xiao], then angrily rushed towards [Lu Xiao]. [Lu Xiao] then forcefully grabbed [Che Linlin] by the neck.
1:33:32|1:33:45|[Lu Xiao] held the unconscious [Che Linlin], who still clutched the codebook in her hand, while [Lu Xiao] fought desperately. After [Lu Xiao] and [Che Linlin] escaped, [Lu Xiao] grabbed [Che Linlin]'s neck, and she instantly triggered the bomb.
1:33:50|1:34:8|Mo Han turned around at the sound and saw a huge mushroom cloud rising not far away. Immediately, Mo Han took Linlin in his arms and walked away quickly. The scene shifted to inside the hospital. Mo Han opened the hospital door and walked to the bedside. She looked worriedly at Yu Xuan, who was covered in injuries.
1:34:52|1:34:54|Yu Xuan also opened her eyes.
1:35:1|1:35:5|Mo Han released Linlin's hand in pain, then turned around.
1:35:13|1:35:16|Tears covered Mo Han's face.
1:35:26|1:35:35|[Lu Xiao] was crouched by [Che Linlin]'s bed, crying bitterly. Then [Che Linlin] weakly took out the heart-shaped necklace from around her neck.
1:35:54|1:35:58|In the end, [Che Linlin] closed her eyes and let go of the necklace in her hand.
1:36:30|1:36:40|The scene shifts, a pair of hands strike a match, igniting the codebook of the Nationalist Army. The burning flames instantly engulf the entire codebook.
1:36:40|1:36:55|At this moment, the screen shows text: After the 918 Incident, the Communist Party of China made long and unremitting efforts to establish a united front against Japan with the Kuomintang. [Hong Zichen] and Miao Yuxuan embarked on a new revolutionary journey.
