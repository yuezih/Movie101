0:0:37|0:0:48|Uncle Shi is practicing martial arts in front of the candlelight. He smiles and swings the stick, frozen in the moment when he lifts it up.
0:0:50|0:1:6|A seagull flies over the water, forming a reflection in the water. A challenge letter is stabbed on the stove with a dagger, and three incense sticks are burning in the stove. [Zhang Ying] and Jin Jixun stand facing each other on both sides of the stove. At this moment, Jin's mother hides with her three siblings in the distant bushes, watching the scene across, with ribbons tied on Jin Jixun's head.
0:1:7|0:1:22|Uncle Shi stared solemnly at Zhang Ying in front of him. Zhang Ying clenched his fists, and in an instant, Jin Jixun raised his fists and charged towards Zhang Ying. Subsequently, the two exchanged punches on the floor covered with tiles. Zhang Ying attacked with punches, causing Jin Jixun to be pushed back.
0:1:22|0:1:32|In an instant, [Zhang Ying] lifted her leg and kicked [Jin Jixun]. Then, [Jin Jixun] leaped up and swiftly threw a back kick towards [Zhang Ying], who blocked the flurry of punches with her hands.
0:1:33|0:1:50|In the bushes, [Jin Jishi] with tears in his eyes watched the two fighting, while the three siblings kept crying and shouting for the battle. [Jin Jishi]'s legs, like phantoms, kept kicking towards [Zhang Ying], who was pushed back by the kicks. Then, the two leaped into the air, followed by a somersault and a twist as they fought together.
0:1:50|0:1:58|At this moment, [Jin Jishi] soared into the air and lunged at [Zhang Ying]. [Zhang Ying] resisted the attack with both arms blocking in front. In the distance, the children kept crying out in fear.
0:1:59|0:2:13|At that moment, [Zhang Ying] waved her arms, creating afterimages in the air. She kept attacking [Jin Jixun], causing him to retreat repeatedly. Suddenly, [Zhang Ying] kicked [Jin Jixun] in the chest, and finally, [Jin Jixun] stabbed [Zhang Ying] in the arm with a knife.
0:2:14|0:2:27|Uncle Shi quickly pounced on Zhang Ying, who kept punching and forcing Jin Jishi to retreat repeatedly. Then, a flying kick knocked Jin Jishi to the ground, and instantly, a large amount of blood spurted from his mouth.
0:2:27|0:2:37|At this moment, [Jin Jishi] slowly stood up and stared at [Jin Jixun], who staggered to the censer. Then, she covered her chest and pulled out the dagger inserted in the censer.
0:2:37|0:2:48|Following that, [Jin Jishi] slowly raised the dagger, the sunlight shining on the ground. In an instant, he forcefully stabbed the dagger into his own abdomen. Afterwards, [Jin Jishi] fell to his knees with five wounds on his chest.
0:2:48|0:2:55|At that moment, [Jin Jishi] saw it and fainted in tears, the children cried out loudly and shook [Jin Jishi] lying on the ground.
0:2:56|0:3:12|Blood soaked [Jin Jishi]'s clothes, also wetting [Zhang Ying]'s fluttering trousers. By the riverbank, the breeze ruffled the water's surface, [Zhang Ying] turned back, weakly kneeling in front of [Jin Jishi]. In the early morning, [Zhang Ying] knelt before Sun Chengmu, [Uncle Shi] was slowly approaching him.
0:3:59|0:4:4|After speaking, [Uncle Shi] turned and walked towards the distance, leaving [Mrs. Liu] kneeling alone in place.
0:4:13|0:4:24|A thin mist lingered in the chaotic sky, and the cold wind stirred the leaves around the tombstones. The dry grass and fallen leaves intertwined on the ground, making [Zhang Ying]'s figure appear particularly desolate.
0:4:24|0:4:33|At this moment, the screen shows the movie title "Dragon Spring World", jointly produced by Changchun Film Studio and Beijing Young Army Film and Television Culture Co., Ltd.
0:4:34|0:4:48|The entire film showcases the profoundness of Chinese martial arts and promotes the idea of enhancing physical fitness through martial arts, narrating the martial spirit of universal love, mutual assistance, and humility. The film was released in China on January 22, 2008.
0:4:49|0:5:7|At the same time, this film has attracted many young movie enthusiasts from the mainland to participate. At noon, under the scorching sun, Wang Chenhao, [Uncle Shi], and Jin Jixun are standing on the playground, swaggering while urinating. They sway their bodies while looking up at the sky, with a smile on Jin Jixun's face as he locks eyes with Wang Chenhao.
0:5:7|0:5:11|At that moment, [Zhang Ying], who was sweeping the floor on the side, slowly walked over with a broom.
0:5:43|0:6:2|On the other side, a small car stopped at the martial arts school. Jin Jixun, Jin Jishi, and their sister Jin Jiuxiu got out of the car with Butler Zhou. They looked around at the scenery inside the school. At that moment, Zhang Ying hurriedly ran over.
0:6:2|0:6:9|Following that, under the guidance of [Zhang Ying], the group walked and observed, passing through students in school uniforms practicing martial arts on the playground.
0:6:15|0:6:34|The students were performing the high kicks in a neat formation. Then, [Zhang Ying] led them to the front of Principal Sun's office. [Zhang Ying] raised his hand to signal them to enter. Subsequently, they entered the office one by one.
0:7:2|0:7:15|Principal took the handmade tea from [Jin Jishi] with a smile. Then, [Jin Jixun] and [Jin Jishi] struggled to grip Principal Sun's hand. In an instant, [Jin Jixun] flew forward and tumbled headfirst.
0:7:29|0:7:43|In the classroom, Fei Niu, Shou Hou, and [Hu Zhi] are playing around, while Wang Chenghao and Peng Lili sit on the side. At this moment, Teacher Wang enters with the three siblings [Jin Jixun]. Soon after, Fei Niu, Shou Hou, and [Hu Zhi] quickly stand up.
0:8:5|0:8:24|After Teacher Wang left, [Jin Jixun] and [Jin Jishi] sat on a bench on the side. [Hu Zhi], Shouhou, and Wang Chenghao quickly surrounded the siblings, while Peng Lili wrinkled her nose on the side, and [Jing Ji] stood with her arms crossed, watching.
0:8:27|0:8:30|The skinny monkey hugged [Jin Jishi]'s arm and gazed at him infatuatedly.
0:8:40|0:8:49|Hu Zhi and Shou Hou hurriedly grabbed the candy from Jing Ji's hand and put it into their mouths. The next day, Zhu the steward was having a video call with Jing Huitai in the hotel.
0:10:7|0:10:14|In the luxurious villa, [Jin Huixian] slowly walked out of the kitchen with a bowl of soup medicine.
0:12:22|0:12:31|Speak up, [Jin Jixun]'s mother fell on the sofa in pain, covering her mouth and coughing. At this moment, [Jin Jixun]'s mother looked at the tissue in her hand, which had a bloodstain on it.
0:12:59|0:13:11|In the boxing classroom, students are practicing martial arts passionately. The classmates are punching at the ribbons continuously, with [Jin Jishi] and Peng Lili sparring with each other. At this moment, [Wang Chenhao] suddenly stood between the two.
0:13:24|0:13:39|Uncle Shi and Zhang Ying were playfully wrestling with each other, while Jin Jixun, who was practicing seriously with a ribbon on the side, glanced at the two before taking off his shirt and continuing his training shirtless. Meanwhile, in the entire classroom, the students were walking around in various corners, earnestly practicing martial arts.
0:13:43|0:13:45|In the cafeteria, the children are lining up for food.
0:14:7|0:14:12|Wang Chenhao handed the cooked meal to Jin Jixun and his two siblings.
0:14:43|0:14:47|[Jin Jixun] and his two siblings pushed open the school gate and walked out, passing by the janitor who was sweeping the floor.
0:15:26|0:15:48|At this moment, [Zhang Ying] sat on the sofa holding a bottle of wine, drinking with a vacant look.
0:16:52|0:16:56|With the conversation ending, the three siblings sat on the sofa with sullen faces, bowing their heads.
0:17:42|0:18:3|Jing Jixiu pursed her lips and looked at [Uncle Shi], then nodded at [Jin Jixun]. Afterwards, they all pushed and shoved their way downstairs. The doors of the mall elevator opened slowly, and the children laughed and jumped out of the elevator.
0:18:24|0:18:31|Speak up, [Jin Jixun] turned and left alone, while the others took the escalator to the cinema.
0:18:55|0:19:10|They scattered into the interior of the cinema, looking around curiously while pointing at the exquisite and huge crystal chandeliers on the ceiling. Then, they happily arrived at the ticket counter, pointing and discussing animatedly as they selected a movie.
0:19:18|0:19:32|After getting their movie tickets, everyone happily turned and ran towards the theater. At the same time, [Jin Jishi] was leisurely strolling in the lobby, when suddenly he saw a sign for a Christmas set meal in front of him.
0:19:36|0:19:39|Shortly after, [Jin Jishi] followed Xiao Qin to the donation booth.
0:19:53|0:20:2|Just as [Jin Jishi] turned around to leave, he caught sight of the fox spirit in front of him holding a donation box. The fox spirit's lively eyes and sweet smile made him stop in his tracks.
0:20:55|0:21:13|On the other side, Wang Chenhao and [Jin Jixun] entered the cinema hall with others. They looked happily at the movie posters on the wall, gathering around them. At that moment, Peng Lili casually walked around with [Jin Jishi]. Finally, the two held hands, but suddenly, two thugs blocked their way.
0:21:23|0:21:42|Wang Chenghao arrived and immediately started fighting with the hooligans. On the other side, [Jin Jixun] observed the situation here. Wang Chenghao turned around and kicked one of the hooligans, sending him flying. The hooligan fell to the ground, clutching his chest, then quickly fled. Immediately after, another hooligan was knocked down by Wang Chenghao.
0:21:50|0:21:54|At this moment, Uncle Shi kicked away the lantern on his head, and the thug quickly fled.
0:21:58|0:22:6|At the same time, on the other side of the wooden table, covered with paper cranes, [Jin Jixun] is carefully folding the card paper in his hand, while [Hu Zhi] throws the paper in his hand to the side.
0:22:57|0:23:3|Although one is flexible and the other is rigid, both use physical movements to express human emotions.
0:23:22|0:23:31|Night falls, [Jin Jixun] walks side by side with [Hu Zhi] on the deserted street, the two of them passing by a coffee shop, laughing as they walk.
0:23:45|0:23:49|Just then, Uncle Shi and Zhang Ying suddenly appeared in front of them.
0:24:16|0:24:18|[Hu Zhi] turned his head to look at the departing Tiger Eyebrow, heaved a deep sigh.
0:24:38|0:24:52|At the same time, Wang Chenghao and others climbed over the railing back into the school. Shortly after, they quietly took out school uniforms, cautiously looking around while tiptoeing towards the guard at the gate. They secretly crouched by the guard's window and peered inside.
0:24:53|0:25:11|At this moment, inside the guard room, [Zhang Ying] is bare-chested, with his arms exposed, drunkenly playing chess. There is a scar the size of a coin above his left arm. He clumsily stacks the chess pieces together and then starts setting up the board to play. The children are lying on the window, constantly craning their necks to look out.
0:25:12|0:25:29|Peng Lili frowned, [Zhang Chenghao] widened his eyes. Uncle Shi and Jin Jixun stretched their necks, while Jin Jishi observed Zhang Ying's movements from under the window. Then, Zhang Ying picked up the bottle of wine beside her and drank it all in one gulp. Seeing this, the children quietly put on their school uniforms and left one after another.
0:25:29|0:25:41|In the house, [Zhang Ying] exuded a strong smell of alcohol in the dim light. She absentmindedly played chess, her eyes fixed on the pieces in her hand. The next morning, Uncle Shi lazily leaned against the railing.
0:26:33|0:26:39|In the afternoon, [Jin Jixun] approached Wang Chenghao, who was practicing dancing in the classroom.
0:27:15|0:27:17|[Zhang Ying] is sweeping the floor on the side.
0:27:22|0:27:31|In the evening, [Jin Jixun] returned to the hotel. The gatekeeper of the martial arts school had a scar on his left arm.
0:27:40|0:27:44|While Jin Jixun was half squatting and talking to Butler Zhou, Jin Jishi walked in and stood in front of the two.
0:28:11|0:28:17|Why are you not at school? As he spoke, [Jin Jixun] raised his hand, ready to hit [Jin Jishi]. Butler Zhou signaled him to stop with his eyes.
0:28:37|0:28:46|Shortly after, [Jin Jishi] approached the fox matchmaker next to Mu Juan. Saying nothing, [Jin Jishi] took out a handbag from behind and handed it to the matchmaker.
0:29:9|0:29:13|Suddenly, Jin Jixun appeared beside the two.
0:30:1|0:30:9|At this moment, [Uncle Shi] is sitting on the sofa in the living room, tutoring [Jin Jishi] with his homework. [Zhang Ying] walks over with a beer in her arms.
0:32:14|0:32:20|Shortly after, the three siblings [Jin Jixun] were sitting in the back row of the classroom, raising their heads and pondering quietly.
0:32:30|0:32:33|Steward Zhou handed the phone to [Jin Jixun].
0:33:6|0:33:11|At the martial arts competition, the host is standing on the stage, while the children are sitting below the stage.
0:33:33|0:33:42|Uncle Shi stood on the second-floor balcony, drinking tea and observing the movements downstairs. At this moment, the short-haired girl walked up to the platform first, followed closely by Jin Jixun.
0:33:47|0:34:5|The short-haired girl first lifted her leg to kick [Jin Jixun], who blocked with his hand, then kicked her in return. The short-haired girl launched another attack, and [Jin Jixun] punched her in the face. She fell heavily to the ground, followed by [Peng Lili] jumping onto the ring and bowing to the referee.
0:34:6|0:34:18|[Peng Lili] and [Jin Jishi] faced each other and immediately started to fight. At this moment, Butler Zhou was fiercely banging the gong, but when he saw Principal Sun looking at him, he quickly put away his fierce expression and put on a smile.
0:34:18|0:34:30|[Li Li Peng] instantly swore and launched a series of attacks towards [Jin Jishi] with her fists. Her rapidly dancing fists formed lightning-like shadows in the air, while [Jin Jishi] struggled to defend himself.
0:34:30|0:34:36|In an instant, [Jin Jishi] was caught by [Peng Lili] with both hands, then [Peng Lili] kicked [Jin Jishi] to the ground.
0:34:45|0:35:1|Afterwards, Uncle Shi and Jin Jishi took the stage first. Following that, the two on stage simultaneously lifted their legs to kick each other. Jin Jishi then performed a spinning kick, but Zhang Ying quickly dodged it. At that moment, Jin Jishi grabbed Jin Jixun's arm and continued to kick and attack him.
0:35:1|0:35:4|Continuing, he kept throwing punches, and [Uncle Shi] was knocked down to the ground.
0:35:8|0:35:23|[Uncle Shi] quickly jumped onto the stage to battle with [Jin Jishi]. [Uncle Shi] lifted his leg to attack [Jin Jishi], who bent down to dodge, then tripped [Uncle Shi] to the ground. Immediately after, [Uncle Shi] got up and grabbed [Jin Jishi]'s leg, while [Jin Jishi] used his elbows to block the attack.
0:35:23|0:35:36|Shortly after, [Uncle Shi] pinned [Thorn Warrior] down. At this moment, [Jin Jishi] suddenly rushed onto the stage, followed by two students from below. The two were quickly knocked down by [Jin Jishi], while [Zhang Ying] watched attentively from the second floor.
0:35:36|0:35:49|Next, [Wang Chenghao] took the stage and engaged in a fight with [Jin Jishi], exchanging rapid punches. Then, [Jin Jishi] spun his body and delivered a high kick towards [Wang Chenghao], while [Hu Zhi] in the audience waved his fists eagerly.
0:35:49|0:35:58|At this moment, [Jin Jixun] kept attacking Wang Chenghao. In an instant, [Jin Jixun] kicked Wang Chenghao and sent him flying onto the stage, where the surrounding reporters were busy taking photos.
0:37:1|0:37:20|[Jin Jixun] walked up to Principal Sun. At that moment, [Jin Jixun] suddenly threw a punch at the principal, and the surrounding reporters started taking photos. Principal Sun was hit and spat out blood in the corner. Suddenly, [Jin Jixun] was knocked down to the ground. As he got up, [Zhang Ying] used a series of punches to knock him down again.
0:37:28|0:37:32|Next, Uncle Shi suddenly ran over from a distance.
0:39:40|0:39:54|Shortly after, Butler Zhou waved his hand, and the three siblings [Jin Jixun] followed Butler Zhou out of the martial arts competition. Marquis Shou stood angrily in place, while Peng Lili and others helped the fainted [Hu Zhi]. [Zhang Ying] stared blankly at the backs of the departing group.
0:40:31|0:40:48|After [Jin Jishi] questioned Xiaoqin, she hurriedly left. At this moment, the revolving door of the hotel slowly opened, Butler Zhou and Jin Jiuxiu walked out of the hotel together, side by side, and came to the hotel lobby.
0:40:53|0:41:0|Suddenly, the two stopped in their tracks and looked up and down in front of them. [Uncle Shi] stood in front of them, with one hand behind his back.
0:41:2|0:41:5|Steward Zhou pursed his lips and frowned, looking at [Uncle Shi].
0:41:58|0:42:13|Butler Zhou pulled [Jin Jixun] and walked out of the hotel lobby. [Uncle Shi] stood still, watching their backs. On the other side, [Jin Jixun] was trying to run into the hospital gate. Meanwhile, in the ward, Wang Chenghao was looking at the unconscious [Hu Zhi] with concern.
0:42:13|0:42:27|Wang Chenghao sat by Uncle Shi's bed with tears in his eyes, with Peng Lili standing behind him. The Fat Ox and Skinny Monkey, who were sitting beside him, were crying bitterly. At this moment, Jin Jixun had already arrived at the nurse's station door, looking around constantly.
0:42:27|0:42:45|In the spacious hospital corridor, [Jin Jishi] stood still. At that moment, he saw the fox spirit sitting on a bench nearby. As [Jin Jishi] approached the fox spirit, she lifted her head, tears streaming down her face, reflecting his figure in her watery eyes.
0:42:45|0:42:53|Suddenly, the monkey in the ward saw the back of [Jin Jishi], and he ran out crying angrily, grabbing [Jin Jishi]'s collar.
0:43:9|0:43:24|Wang Chenhao smashed his fist on [Jin Jishi], [Hu Mei] stood up, and [Uncle Shi] and others surrounded [Jin Jishi]. Then, [Hu Mei] stood in front of the ward door with her back to [Jin Jishi].
0:45:9|0:45:17|On the other side, [Zhang Ying] is sitting by Principal Sun's bed. This matter has caused a sensation and become the focus of attention in the whole province.
0:46:42|0:46:45|However, in order to seek revenge, they will stop at nothing.
0:47:13|0:47:18|In Chinese chess, the horse and cannon each have different ways of moving.
0:47:53|0:48:2|Speak up, Principal Sun lay down, [Zhang Ying] got up and walked to the side, deep in thought. He put down the newspaper, furrowed his brow, and crossed his hands behind his back.
0:48:2|0:48:20|In the early morning of the fourth day, the children were practicing martial arts on the grass. The Monkey wrapped the double shoes sticks around his body, [Peng Lili] played with flying knives, Fei Niu waved a long stick, [Wang Chenghao] spun the long sword in his hand. He quickly spun the sword around his body, followed by a backflip landing on the ground, then immediately took an oath, squatting halfway and holding the sword level.
0:48:21|0:48:34|At this moment, [Zhang Ying] walked over with a serious expression. At noon, Wang Chenhao and [Peng Lili] arrived at [Zhang Ying]'s office.
0:49:3|0:49:6|However, there is still one month left before the competition.
0:49:21|0:49:24|Hua Bi, [Zhang Ying], stood up with a teacup in hand.
0:49:30|0:49:32|So, the responsibility on your shoulders is great, I hope you can perform well in the competition.
0:50:1|0:50:18|Saying that, Wang Chenhao and Peng Lili looked at each other in confusion, then they secretly arrived at a closed corridor. They tiptoed through the corridor to a door, and then they quietly opened the door to peek inside. In the room, [Uncle Shi] was standing in a circle of candles practicing internal energy.
0:50:19|0:50:33|The bamboo platform under the bamboo fire is about one foot high, and the flames keep flickering. The sweat on Uncle Shi's body glistens like dew. The bamboo fire reflects on Uncle Shi's strong and powerful arms, highlighting the clear lines of his muscles in a heroic manner.
0:50:33|0:50:43|At this moment, [Uncle Shi] suddenly spread out his arms, lifted his palms in front of his chest, then he opened his hands, fingers striking out a series of punches like a praying mantis, and finally stopped in place.
0:50:44|0:51:3|Uncle Shi stood in a horse stance, waving his hands continuously. At this moment, Wang Chenghao and Peng Lili outside the door watched Uncle Shi with wide eyes. Then Uncle Shi spread his arms, continuously punching forward along the surrounding candles. The style of his punches kept changing. Uncle Shi pushed his palms forward, then struck in the air, causing the nearby candle flames to extinguish instantly.
0:51:4|0:51:19|Outside the door, the two men stared intently. At this moment, [Uncle Shi] once again swung his fist into the air. He bent his arms, slightly leaned his body forward, and struck out with a pick fist. His hands alternated forward continuously, creating gusts of cold wind in the air, resembling a fierce tiger in action.
0:51:23|0:51:44|From then on, [Uncle Shi] picked up a long stick and swiftly swung it into the air. The stick danced in [Uncle Shi]'s hand, causing the surrounding candlelight to sway along. As [Uncle Shi] continued to wave the stick in his hand, the spinning stick in the air cast overlapping shadows, while he kept striking forward.
0:51:44|0:51:57|The stick vibrated the air, extinguishing the surrounding candles in an instant. Then, [Uncle Shi] held the stick at his side, and Peng Lili and Wang Chenhao, seeing this, immediately closed the door. [Uncle Shi] stood still, a smile appearing on his face.
0:51:57|0:52:5|It's late at night, Peng Lili and Wang Chenhao are practicing martial arts in the backyard. The cement path under their feet is painted with a chessboard pattern, with chess pieces placed inside the squares.
0:52:6|0:52:22|Peng Lili and Wang Chenhao were practicing martial arts, but both slipped on the wet ground. After falling, they quickly got up and continued dancing. Meanwhile, [Zhang Ying] sat aside, playing chess and drinking alone. Peng Lili was kicking high, while Wang Chenhao practiced martial arts with a horse stance.
0:52:29|0:52:46|Four days later, the morning sun shone on the plaque of the Great Hero Hall, and the towering trees swayed in the breeze. In front of the hall, there was an incense burner marked with the traces of time, emitting wisps of smoke from the burning incense inside. The stone lions placed symmetrically in front of the hall had their mouths open, looking very majestic.
0:52:47|0:53:5|In the main hall at this moment, [Peng Lili] and [Wang Chenhao] are practicing martial arts, with [Zhang Ying] solemnly watching them on the side. The hall is filled with long hanging curtains, on which are densely written Buddhist scriptures. Rows of Buddha statues are neatly arranged on stone pedestals, with [Wang Chenhao] and [Peng Lili] standing next to a giant Buddha statue that is about ten meters high.
0:53:5|0:53:14|Serious practice of martial arts, the two of them fixed their lower bodies in horse stances, continuously waving their arms in the air, while [Zhang Ying] watched with hands behind his back.
0:53:14|0:53:26|At this moment, [Peng Lili] began practicing high kicks, as she kicked and turned to walk backwards, continuously practicing her palm techniques. Meanwhile, [Wang Chenhao] clenched his teeth tightly and rapidly punched into the air.
0:53:26|0:53:43|After a quick turn, he changed the position of his hands to tiger claws, then took big steps forward, practicing tiger claws with alternating hands. Beside him, [Zhang Ying] nodded in approval. Later, [Wang Chenhao] arrived at a few candles and swiftly executed tiger punches, causing the candles to be extinguished one by one.
0:53:43|0:53:52|At noon that day, [Peng Lili] and [Wang Chenhao] were sitting side by side in the cafeteria eating. There was a bruise on [Wang Chenhao]'s shoulder, and at that moment, [Uncle Shi] walked over.
0:54:43|0:55:2|At the same time, the three siblings [Jin Jixun] were standing in a luxurious villa, with [Jin Jishi] sitting on a stone chair in the courtyard watching them. The siblings were standing next to a stone table. At this moment, [Jin Jishi] was holding a cigar in one hand and a glass of red wine in the other, while the siblings stood by with their heads bowed.
0:55:2|0:55:4|[Jin Jixun] picked up a wine glass and took a sip of red wine.
0:57:12|0:57:16|Jin Jixun lay weakly on the bed, then she opened her eyes and looked at Jin Jishi.
0:59:19|0:59:23|Speak up, [Jin Jishi] turned and left, then [Jin Jixun] stared with wide eyes and fell beside the bed.
0:59:29|0:59:47|Steward Zhou placed his hand on [Jin Jishi]'s shoulder, only to be pushed away. That night, [Zhang Ying] practiced martial arts with Wang Chenghao and Peng Lili in the classroom. [Zhang Ying] watched attentively from the side, and when Peng Lili and Wang Chenghao stopped, [Zhang Ying] walked over slowly.
1:0:24|1:0:36|Soon after, Wang Chenhao and Peng Lili turned and left, with [Zhang Ying] frowning as she watched their retreating figures. The next morning, Wu Mei sat on the sofa, looking at the letter in her hand, while [Hu Zhi] slept soundly beside her.
1:1:31|1:1:46|[Hu Zhi] woke up and frowned as he stared at the fox spirit's eyes. At that moment, the fox spirit turned her head. [Hu Zhi] then lay back down. The fox spirit covered [Hu Zhi] with a blanket and picked up the letter on the table.
1:1:49|1:2:0|A few days later, Wang Chenghao was practicing martial arts in the bamboo forest with a long stick. Uncle Shi, with Hu Zhi standing beside him, followed Zhang Ying. Wang Chenghao was shirtless, continuously striking the dry grass around him with the stick.
1:2:3|1:2:20|Wu Zhi stood in the distance clapping his hands, [Zhang Ying] stood with hands behind her back, watching Wang Chenghao intently. Wu had a big smile on his face as he patted Wu Zhi's shoulder. At this moment, a thin layer of sweat appeared on Wang Chenghao's body, and his muscular lines looked very strong under the sunlight.
1:2:20|1:2:32|Wang Chenghao kept hitting the dry grass around him. Then, he raised the stick above his head and continuously rotated it on both sides of his body, creating multiple shadows in the air. Immediately after, he broke a section of the liver bamboo.
1:2:34|1:2:44|Wang Chenghao swung the stick behind him. In an instant, a thick bamboo suddenly fell to the ground.
1:3:2|1:3:14|The next morning, Uncle Shi examined Hu Zhi's body, with Hu Mei and Xiao Qing standing by watching. Uncle Shi carefully felt Hu Zhi's muscles and bones, then stood up and looked at him.
1:4:3|1:4:18|The sun was setting, [Uncle Shi] sat alone by the window of the café, watching the bustling street. In [Uncle Shi]'s eyes, there were flickering figures of pedestrians. She lowered her head in melancholy, stirring the drink in her hand, the orange tea in the glass pot was sweet and sour.
1:4:18|1:4:31|[Hu Mei] looked at the orange tea with a vacant expression, devoid of any light. Just then, Xiaoqin, carrying a backpack and wearing jeans, appeared in the coffee shop with a big smile on her face. "Come on," [Xiaoqin] bounced over to [Hu Mei].
1:6:33|1:6:38|With those words, [Zhang Ying] turned around and walked away, and the fox spirit quickly followed.
1:7:11|1:7:25|[Zhang Ying] nodded, then [Hu Mei] frowned and walked away from [Zhang Ying]. [Zhang Ying] stood in place, looking worriedly at [Hu Mei]'s departing figure. A few days later, [Wang Chenghao] and [Peng Lili] walked side by side on the campus path, carrying their luggage.
1:7:25|1:7:30|[Shou Hou] stands beside [Wang Chenghao], holding his bag, while [Hu Mei] pulls [Hu Zhi] following behind [Peng Lili].
1:7:43|1:7:47|[Uncle Shi] handed the package to [Wang Chenghao], and then they left first.
1:8:21|1:8:46|Principal Sun is talking to Zhang Ying, when Wang Chenhao and his group walk up to Zhang Ying. After shaking hands with Principal Sun, Zhang Ying leaves with Jin Jixun and the others. In the hotel lobby, Zhang Ying is packing luggage with the children.
1:10:51|1:11:6|Shortly after, [Jin Jishi] led Butler Zhou, the three siblings [Hu Zhi], and the four top experts out of the hotel. [Zhang Ying] and the children stood in place watching them leave. The next day, [Hu Mei] stood in front of a bridal shop, looking at the posters on the door.
1:11:6|1:11:14|Uncle Shi was completely absorbed in watching, when suddenly Zhang Ying quietly approached from the side. Seeing this, Jin Jixun reached out and grabbed Zhang Ying's hand.
1:12:26|1:12:29|[Hu Mei] turned around crying, looking at the red plum blossoms.
1:12:45|1:12:49|Shortly after, [Uncle Shi] turned around and walked away, unable to bear watching her back.
1:13:0|1:13:5|It's late at night, Wu Mei sits on the edge of the bed, holding the shoes that [Hu Mei] gave her.
1:13:49|1:14:1|At this moment, [Hu Mei] sat alone on the edge of the bed, looking down at the pair of shoes in her hands. She kept touching the surface of the shoes, frowning tightly, with tears constantly swirling in her eyes.
1:14:1|1:14:12|The next morning, [Zhang Ying] took Wang Chenghao, Peng Lili, [Hu Mei], and Xiaoqin to the ancestral hall of the three siblings [Jin Jixun] in Jingshi, where they were offering incense and bowing. The group stood in a row in the hall, lighting incense.
1:14:51|1:15:3|After speaking, Uncle Shi, Zhang Ying, Jin Jixun, and Jin Jishi all inserted the incense in their hands into the censer, then placed their hands together in front of them and bowed in salute.
1:15:53|1:16:11|Following that, the three siblings [Jin Jixun] jumped down from the wooden pavilion next to Butler Zhou and Jin Huitai. At the same time, Wang Chenghao and Peng Lili ran towards the direction of the siblings. Jin Huitai smoked a cigar, smiled with Butler Zhou, while [Zhang Ying] looked sternly across. Xiaoqin helped [Hu Mei] walk forward.
1:16:11|1:16:19|At this moment, Wang Chenghao and [Jin Jixun] jumped onto the wooden stool. [Jin Jixun] lifted his leg and kicked towards Wang Chenghao, who leaned back to dodge.
1:16:19|1:16:31|Shortly after, [Jin Jixun] kicked Wang Chenghao off the wooden stool. Wang Chenghao fell backwards and immediately got up to counterattack, forcing [Jin Jixun] to dodge backwards.
1:16:31|1:16:48|On the other side, Peng Lili had the Xiaoluos lying on the ground, and the four masters stepped forward to confront her. One man and one woman were facing off against Peng Lili. Meanwhile, two men approached Zhang Ying. Just as the two men threw punches, Zhang Ying stopped them and then knocked them down to the ground.
1:16:48|1:17:7|In an instant, [Jin Jixun] threw a punch at Wang Chenghao, who grabbed his arm and the two continued to fight in mid-air. Wang Chenghao kicked [Jin Jixun] down to the ground. Jin Huitai widened his eyes on the side, while Butler Zhou quietly retreated. In a flash, [Jin Jishi] knocked down Feng Lili.
1:17:10|1:17:23|Following that, [Jin Jishi] launched an attack on Peng Lili, who kept retreating. [Jin Jishi] then intercepted [Jin Jixun]. Wang Chenghao watched from the side as [Jin Jixun] suddenly charged towards him.
1:17:39|1:17:50|At this moment, Wang Chenghao grabbed Uncle Shi's hand and then kicked him away. Uncle Shi's mouth was bleeding and he fainted. Seeing this, Butler Zhou quickly ran away, while the Fox Matchmaker beside him turned pale with fright.
1:17:53|1:18:10|In the central courtyard of the ancestral hall, everyone was in chaos. [Zhang Ying] was still dealing with several small Luo Luo, each holding a knife and being knocked down by [Zhang Ying]. Wu Mei and Xiao Qing stood on the side, walking past the right side, looking around anxiously. The small Luo Luo kept stabbing towards [Zhang Ying], and at this moment,
1:18:10|1:18:26|A man wearing sunglasses suddenly appeared beside Wang Chenghao. The man walked towards Wang Chenghao and then started throwing punches at him. Wang Chenghao dodged and defended himself against the attacks, then lifted his leg to kick the man with sunglasses. The man with sunglasses dodged by bending down, then spun around and kicked Wang Chenghao in the face.
1:18:26|1:18:43|Following that, Wang Chenghao turned around and continued to fight with the man in sunglasses. Soon after, the man in sunglasses was knocked down by Wang Chenghao. Wang Chenghao then leaped into the air and heavily pressed down on [the man in sunglasses]. Subsequently, Wang Chenghao went to help [Peng Lili], while [Jin Jixun] threw a punch at Wang Chenghao, who extended his arm to block it.
1:18:43|1:18:48|Shortly after, Wang Chenghao kicked [Jin Jixun] down, and [Jin Jixun] grimaced in pain, clutching his stomach.
1:18:49|1:19:4|On the other side, [Zhang Ying] rose in pain, with his feet each straddling the chests of two little Luo Luo. Immediately, he grabbed one Luo Luo's arm and kicked the other Luo Luo away with one leg.
1:19:4|1:19:16|At this moment, [Jin Jishi] hurried over, frowning as he watched everyone fighting, then turned to look at the Fox Eyebrows behind him. Just then, [Jin Jixiu] pulled out a knife and threw it, the knife stabbing [Jin Jishi].
1:19:17|1:19:20|The ancestral hall was in a mess, and the Xiaoluolos were beaten and lying on the ground wailing.
1:19:34|1:19:47|Suddenly, [Man in Sunglasses] pulled out a flying needle and threw it. At the same time, [Jin Jishi] pulled out a handgun, and [Zhang Ying] flicked away the flying needle with her fingers. The needle hit [Jin Jixun]'s hand, causing him to drop the gun and clutch his hand, slowly crouching down.
1:19:47|1:20:3|[Jin Jixun] had blood continuously flowing from his hand, he frowned in pain and shook his head, beads of sweat seeping from his forehead. At this moment, [Zhang Ying] and Wang Chenghao slowly walked up from behind him. Holding his injured and bleeding hand, [Jin Jixun] stopped, and [Zhang Ying] paused beside him.
1:20:12|1:20:16|At this moment, [Zhang Ying] slowly squatted down, gazing at [Jin Jixun].
1:20:35|1:20:44|Shortly after, [Zhang Ying] helped [Jin Jixun] to stand up slowly by supporting his shoulder. He embraced [Jin Jixun] and walked forward, while [Jin Jixun] shook his head as they walked.
1:20:49|1:20:57|The two slowly walked towards the center of the ancestral hall, facing a cup in front of Jin's father and mother. [Jin Jixun] lowered his head, tears rolling in his eyes.
1:20:57|1:21:12|Shortly after, [Zhang Ying] and [Jin Jixun] exchanged a smile. [Zhang Ying]'s gaze slowly extended into the distance, where birds flew across the misty sky and a ray of sunlight pierced through the clouds. On the school playground, children stood in formation in their school uniforms.
1:21:13|1:21:27|They were practicing martial arts seriously on the playground. Teacher Wang stood at the front of the line, with a whistle in his mouth, while the children performed horse stances and punched and kicked forward. Principal Sun was in the distance, supervising the children's movements.
1:21:27|1:21:38|Wang Chenghao, [Hu Zhi], Shou Hong, Peng Lili, and Bei Niu stood at the far left of the team, practicing martial arts together. They squatted halfway and punched forward, then turned around in a circle, followed by a palm strike.
1:21:39|1:21:57|Uncle Shi stood aside as Monk Qiu watched attentively, a pleased smile on his face. With his hands behind his back, Uncle Shi surveyed the children practicing martial arts. Principal Sun glanced down at the children's movements, then looked into the distance and smiled, bowing his fist in salute to Uncle Shi.
1:21:58|1:22:8|Uncle Shi greeted Principal Sun with a fist salute, while Zhang Ying also raised his fist to pay respect to the two. The children were earnestly practicing punches, practicing front kicks and leg lifts.
1:22:8|1:22:26|By the coast, seagulls are pecking for food in the shallow pool, reflecting the beautiful scenery and the silhouettes of seabirds on the beach. An abandoned, broken fishing boat is stranded on the receding shore, with debris and dry grass dominating the ground. The sunlight casts long shadows of [Zhang Ying] and [Hu Zhi] as they slowly walk towards the harbor.
1:22:33|1:22:35|[Zhang Ying] looked back at [Hu Zhi].
