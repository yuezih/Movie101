0:0:31|0:0:49|In the messy and chaotic room of the wedding case, accompanied by a few barks, a middle-aged woman wearing a nurse's uniform and a mask is dragging the floor absent-mindedly. A breeze blows into the room, causing the curtains to gently sway, and the small dogs locked in cages occasionally stick out their tongues to look at the woman dragging the floor.
0:0:50|0:1:7|Originally belonged to the neat long hair behind her head, a few strands became loose due to continuous movements, falling on both sides of her cheeks. However, the woman didn't mind, but stopped her movements, took out a bottle of water from her pocket, unscrewed the lid, took off her mask, and started to swallow it sip by sip.
0:1:7|0:1:15|The curtain swayed slightly again at this moment, with [Fan Li] leaning on the mop handle and holding a water bottle, staring blankly ahead.
0:1:16|0:1:27|Suddenly, a slight noise interrupted his thoughts. He quickly stuffed the water bottle back into his pocket and turned to walk down the corridor, only to bump into a curly-haired man holding a large dog.
0:1:27|0:1:43|The middle-aged woman turned out to value a pet doctor. When she saw the anxious curly-haired man with his dying big dog in his arms, she quickly ushered them into the house and naturally began to administer first aid amidst the dog's barks. In the film, she also has another identity, that of a mother.
0:1:44|0:2:2|The scene shifts to the taxi driver labeled as [Sudan] in the driver's seat, driving in the dimly lit streets in light rain. The gloomy and humid weather, along with the scarce business, makes him very irritable. Fortunately, at this moment, the rain seeps through the window and falls on his grizzled temples, extinguishing the inner irritability.
0:2:2|0:2:9|The good times didn't last long. The congested traffic on a rainy night, along with pedestrians running red lights, once again furrowed [Sudan]'s brow.
0:2:10|0:2:24|Suddenly, the taxi driver sharply turned the steering wheel, stopping in front of a beautifully decorated KTV. The woman in high heels in the back seat paid and left, only then did she put down her arm supporting her forehead, let out a refreshing sigh, and left.
0:2:24|0:2:33|On the other side, a boy with short hair and wearing a polo shirt slowly enters the snack street. He walks past an intersection, then quickly turns his head and grabs his companion.
0:2:36|0:2:42|Looking in the direction of his gaze, at the end of the snack street, a long-haired girl was eating with her back to him.
0:2:55|0:3:13|The taxi driver, upon hearing this, had no choice but to step on the gas and accelerate away from the narrow snack street. The boy, [Wu Tao], couldn't wait to shift his gaze away from his father. Little did he know that when he looked back, the girl had already paid and left the spot. The courage that had been built up seemed to deflate like a balloon, disappearing in an instant.
0:3:13|0:3:16|So [Wu Tao] could only stare blankly at the girl's departing figure.
0:3:17|0:3:34|After a moment of silence, [Fan Li] glanced at her companions beside her, then they left the snack street one after the other. On the bright and clean marble floor, a woman's slender figure was reflected, perhaps [Fan Li], with her carefully permed and dyed curly hair standing up behind her head with a scarf.
0:3:34|0:3:47|Dressed in a refreshing cheongsam with a leather skirt, highlighting her great figure, with a leather backpack slung over her left shoulder and a bag of snacks and drinks in her right hand, she walked out of the KTV. There was no one around, only [Wu Tao]'s father's taxi parked outside.
0:3:48|0:4:5|After hesitating for a moment, the woman in a leather skirt opened the door of the passenger seat and sat down. Stepping on the gas pedal, [Wu Tao]'s father quickly drove away from the scene. By the dock in the early morning, two workers moored the boat to the shore and under the moonlight, they seemed to be salvaging something.
0:4:5|0:4:9|At this moment, strange noises could be heard coming from the road by the shore.
0:4:10|0:4:21|Sudan and Fan Li looked up towards the shore, where a taxi, with a screeching of brakes, unexpectedly drove straight into the river, speeding through the railing and uncontrollably plunging into the river.
0:4:21|0:4:34|Two workers were directly frightened by the scene in front of them, standing helplessly by the pitch-black river, unable to move. Although the tall crane in the distance was brightly lit, the small commotion could hardly attract much attention.
0:4:35|0:4:50|Several days later, in the hospital, a patient with a newly fitted brace on his left lower leg slowly woke up from the bed. The monitoring device beeped intermittently, indicating that the patient was fine, but the following scene still made people sigh involuntarily.
0:4:51|0:5:11|The patient is the woman in the leather skirt. Her once beautiful face is now covered in scars, with thick bandages on her forehead. As she carefully props herself up on her elbows and sits up from the bed, her previously confused eyes are fixed firmly on her left calf. She cautiously tries to move it, but soon realizes that something is wrong.
0:5:23|0:5:41|Upon seeing this, [Doctor] and the nurse hurried into the room. The doctor first supported the patient's body and examined his left lower leg, which was raised high. Then, with his hands in his pockets, he leisurely walked out of the ward. On the other side, the area where the car fell off the pier had already been cordoned off. The police were using a crane to salvage the vehicle.
0:5:42|0:5:56|Before long, a taxi with a deformed body slowly emerged from the water. With the help of a crane, water was continuously seeping out from the car body, which had already been severely damaged. Pieces of the heavily damaged car front also occasionally fell off.
0:5:56|0:6:11|On the shore, although a cordon was set up, curious citizens still gathered around, pointing and chatting about the taxi. Before long, the taxi was hoisted ashore, and in the opening scene of the story, the middle-aged veterinarian, under police escort, also arrived at the salvage site.
0:6:12|0:6:29|The two of them looked up at the taxi in the hazy sky, unable to say a word for a long time. But the embroidered patches on their clothes seemed to still reveal the trace of Little River's father. At this moment, a strong wind blew by, causing the taxi to sway in the air, and also causing the mother and son to squint their eyes.
0:6:31|0:6:48|Finally, the taxi slowly landed on the ground, the crane returned to its place, and the police stood silently not far away. However, the mother and son still faced [Jiang Feng], staring at the taxi in silence, allowing the crowd on the shore to watch.
0:6:48|0:6:55|The commotion by the shore quickly attracted many strong men with shovels for farming.
0:7:1|0:7:8|A man walked past the mother and son, answered firmly, and then walked towards the river with a long pole in his hand.
0:7:17|0:7:31|In the midst of the conversation, [Sudan's mother] had already followed the man to the riverside. She handed over a photo of Sudan's father to the man, while bowing respectfully. Meanwhile, [Sudan] remained in place, gazing at the boats passing by on the river lost in thought.
0:7:31|0:7:45|After Sudan finished pleading, the mother and son boarded the small boat heading to the opposite shore. On the simple boat, there was a family of four planning to travel together, as well as farmers going out to work. Fan Li looked at the rushing river and whispered.
0:7:51|0:8:6|Lying on the railing, [Wu Tao] listened, turned his head to look at his mother, then shifted his gaze to the river, pursed his lips, wanting to say something, but then stopped himself, and then shifted his gaze to the surging river in front of him.
0:8:6|0:8:13|[Su Dan] was surprised to see a small opening cut through the river surface, while the wonders among the mountains puzzled his eyes.
0:8:16|0:8:29|The character [Sudan], wearing a hospital gown, was originally lying on the hospital bed with her head tilted, staring blankly. The thick bandage on her forehead was removed as the wound healed. Upon hearing the nurse's voice, she slowly straightened her head and her gaze moved dazedly towards the foot of the bed.
0:8:29|0:8:41|Seeing that the newcomer was [Mrs. Xiao Chuan], she first pursed her already cracked lips, then with the help of the nurse, slowly propped up her upper body, leaning against the head of the bed. Her originally lifeless eyes were now instantly filled with tears.
0:8:42|0:9:11|[Sudan] clenched her teeth and gripped the bedsheet tightly, holding back tears. Xiao Chuan's mother stood directly in front of [Sudan], watching her injured appearance, the words she had intended to say suddenly stuck in her throat. [Sudan] simply took the cup of water handed to her by the nurse and handed it back.
0:9:19|0:9:26|Standing on the other side of the bed, Sudan, upon hearing the nurse's words, quickly dropped his arms that were originally held in front of his chest, staring with wide eyes as the nurse walked away.
0:9:28|0:9:35|After saying these words, [Sudan] left the ward fiercely, leaving two women awkwardly facing each other in front of the sickbed.
0:9:35|0:9:50|Early the next morning, as promised, Xiao Chuan's mother asked him to come to the hospital to take care of [Sudan]. She brought a plastic basin from outside and handed it to him when she reached [Sudan], then quickly turned her head, resting one arm on the end of the bed and looking out the window.
0:9:50|0:9:56|After a refreshing sigh, the sound of gurgling water instantly filled the small hospital room.
0:10:2|0:10:6|[Sudan] took the basin with his right hand and placed it under him, but his eyes were fixed firmly on Xiao Chuan.
0:10:11|0:10:22|Xiao Chuan lowered his head, expressionless, and responded impatiently. [Sudan] took the tissue from the bedside, rolled it up, and then reached into the covers.
0:10:32|0:10:47|Upon hearing the call from [Sudan], the originally dazed Xiaochuan finally turned around, looked at the other person, and then slowly walked towards the bed. [Sudan] was holding a plastic basin at this moment, gesturing for Xiaochuan to take it. The basin, which was originally empty, was now filled with liquid in the blink of an eye.
0:10:48|0:11:4|But when he took it, [Sudan] said with a smile. Watching Xiaochuan holding a plastic basin, looking at a loss, [Sudan] couldn't help but laugh, but as he laughed, the corners of his mouth that were originally upturned suddenly drooped, and there seemed to be a flicker in his eyes.
0:11:4|0:11:25|He quickly turned his head towards the side of the sickbed, blocking Sudan's curious gaze. Seeing this, Sudan picked up the plastic basin in his hand and turned to look out the window. It was late at night when Sudan returned from the ward to his home. He pulled out a toolbox from under his bed and carefully held it, then sat down at the desk.
0:11:25|0:11:31|On the simple desk made of thick tree trunks, old computers and various learning supplies are neatly arranged.
0:11:32|0:11:49|Xiao Chuan, however, was not in the mood for anything else at the moment. He sat in the main chair and opened the lid of the toolbox. Then he took out three small colorful clay figures, each the size of a palm. Looking closely, one was a short middle-aged man with a beer belly, and the other was a middle-aged woman in a nurse's uniform.
0:11:49|0:12:9|The last one, unlike the first two, has not been colored yet. However, the little Sudan with short hair and a revealing shirt looks somewhat like a little stream. After thinking for a while, he took out a utility knife from the toolbox and, under the dim desk lamp, meticulously carved the figure on the small person's body.
0:12:9|0:12:14|Under the dilapidated old eaves, only the warm summer night breeze accompanies the earnestly carved teenager under the light.
0:12:41|0:12:51|At this moment, [Sudan] also slowly woke up, feeling the boy's actions, he just opened his eyes, although expressionless, he did not speak to stop him.
0:13:2|0:13:6|The bank teller is explaining to [Fan Li]'s mother.
0:13:12|0:13:31|Hearing that it would take two years to get the money, [Sudan] helplessly smirked at the insurance clerk, then stuffed the policy into her bag and left the insurance company. She then arrived at a processing factory where a worker was carefully welding materials together with an electric welder, assembling a new wheelchair.
0:13:31|0:13:38|In no time, the mobility aid that originally had a footrest on the left side of the wheelchair was transformed into a brand new look with a support bar on the left side.
0:13:40|0:13:51|After the master stopped, Sudan's mother couldn't wait to sit down and experience it first. Once seated, her entire left leg could be stretched straight and placed on the support bar, and the movement was very stable.
0:14:5|0:14:12|Mom Xiao sits on the hospital bed and says to [Sudan]. [Sudan] looks at Mom Xiao incredulously.
0:14:27|0:14:40|Sitting on the wheelchair, bouncing and talking at the same time. Little River's mom paid no attention to the eccentricity of [Sudan], but nervously fiddled with her left leg on the wheelchair.
0:14:42|0:15:2|In the bustling and crowded market, middle-aged men with open collars can be seen everywhere due to the heat. The market is filled with constant shouting from vendors, and many middle-aged women bargaining for vegetables are getting red-faced over the prices. A thick-skinned watermelon is sliced open, juice splashing everywhere, making people crave a piece immediately.
0:15:3|0:15:26|At this moment, [Sudan] in a wheelchair is being pushed by Xiaochuan's mother to the intersection. Facing the crowded crowd, she can only cautiously move forward. Occasionally, she meets a few neighbors and nods to greet them. As they go deeper and the crowd grows, Xiaochuan's mother has to speak up to ask pedestrians to make way.
0:15:29|0:15:46|The wheelchair stopped on a long street, Xiao Chuan's mother turned back and asked Xiao Chuan, but Xiao Chuan silently refused. "Come on," Xiao Chuan's mother helped [Sudan] up from the wheelchair, put her arm on her shoulder, and carefully walked towards the steps.
0:15:50|0:16:3|Reluctantly, [Wu Tao] had to fold up the wheelchair and walk behind the two with a cane in a crooked manner. However, with a glance, a slender waist of [Sudan] was revealed along with the swaying posture.
0:16:3|0:16:12|The boy's eyes uncontrollably continued to look down, revealing a pair of fresh and tender legs in silk stockings under the short skirt. Feeling dry-mouthed, he quickly lowered his head and swallowed his saliva.
0:16:17|0:16:24|[Xiao Chuan] exerted force to place the wheelchair on the platform at the top of the steps. [Xiao Chuan]'s mother quickly helped [Sudan] sit in the wheelchair.
0:16:31|0:16:48|[Ma Dongmei]'s mother greeted the neighbors while pushing the wheelchair down the alley. [Sudan] casually adjusted her long hair at the waist and enjoyed [Ma Dongmei]'s mother's service. Around a corner, [Ma Dongmei] arrived in a corridor filled with mahjong tables.
0:16:48|0:16:55|Wearing a cool outfit, [Sudan] quickly caught the attention of a group of shirtless old men.
0:16:57|0:17:17|[Ma Dongmei] pushed the wheelchair while answering, continuing to move deeper. They stopped in front of a dusty wooden cabinet. Then, [Wu Tao] cautiously helped [Sudan] into the house.
0:17:22|0:17:36|After cooking in the greasy alley, the three of them sat around in the shabby living room, eating the most ordinary meal. Sudan, however, took a bite and then put down his chopsticks.
0:17:48|0:18:3|Mrs. Xiaochuan spat out the bone from her mouth and gently placed it on the dining table. Then, she asked the same question again without giving up. Xiaochuan glanced at the dishes in the bowl and answered softly.
0:18:4|0:18:15|"Sudan, go ahead," and quickly shoveled the food into his mouth. Mrs. Xiao Chuan paused with the chopsticks reaching for the dishes in the plate, turned her head to look at Xiao Chuan, and then continued.
0:18:19|0:18:27|After whispering, Xiaochuan's mother picked up the chopsticks again and carefully moved the dishes in the bowl. [Sudan] slowly put down the bowl at this moment.
0:18:29|0:18:33|Sudan gently wheeled away after speaking.
0:18:37|0:19:2|[Sudan], who had already leisurely walked to the door, heard this and made an effort to turn around, walking back towards the living room. Watching [Sudan] slowly walking towards the sofa that had long exposed its cotton filling, [Fan Li] said calmly. But [Sudan] had already laid down on the sofa.
0:19:10|0:19:15|[Wu Tao], who was eating, had to put down his chopsticks and pick up a cane from the wheelchair to walk to [Sudan]'s side.
0:19:18|0:19:31|After leaning the cane against the coffee table, carefully lifting the left leg of [Sudan], then embracing her waist and slowly standing up. Finally handing her the cane, they supported each other as they walked towards the bathroom.
0:19:31|0:19:41|Upon entering the bathroom, [Wu Tao] quickly lifted the toilet seat, then took the crutch with one hand and held [Sudan]'s right arm with the other, slowly helping her sit on the toilet.
0:19:42|0:19:55|[Wu Tao] also slowed down his eating, glancing towards the direction of the bathroom from time to time. After seeing [Sudan] settle down, [Wu Tao] brought a chair from the living room and then lifted her left leg and placed it on top.
0:19:57|0:20:12|The shrill whistle of the train woke up the city to a new day. The mist blended with the steam of the train as it passed through the outskirts' intersection. Early workers had to stop and watch as the clanging train slowly departed.
0:20:12|0:20:29|Near the railway tracks, amidst the chaotic factories and rusty gas pipelines, abandoned waste continued to be discharged into the sky from the dilapidated buildings. In the living room, [Sudan] was awakened by the sound of the train whistle, then stretched his arms and yawned.
0:20:35|0:20:41|Impatiently, [Sudan] quickly propped up his upper body, attempting to awaken the mother and son with his voice.
0:20:41|0:20:57|After a long wait with no response, [Sudan] carefully moved his left leg and slowly sat up from the sofa. He fumbled to put on his right slipper, then twisted his body, propping himself up on the sofa armrests with both arms, and finally stood up slowly with one foot.
0:20:57|0:21:1|Seeing the wheelchair across the coffee table, [Sudan] lightly hopped over to the bookcase next to the sofa.
0:21:2|0:21:15|After safely sitting in the wheelchair, [Sudan] quickly lifted his left leg with both hands onto the footrest, took big breaths, and then slowly wheeled towards the window in the living room.
0:21:15|0:21:30|The sunlight outside the house shone through the curtains into the room. [Sudan] walked to the window, carefully supporting his weight with his right leg to stand up, then steadied himself on the window frame and opened it. However, the next moment, he was stunned by what he saw in front of him.
0:21:31|0:21:47|In the early morning, as the sun was pulled over the distant mountains, the thick clouds blocked the light in an instant. [Sudan] looked to the right front, and a neatly growing small tree, moistened by the morning dew, was confidently displaying its dazzling power.
0:22:2|0:22:17|The next moment, the sunlight suddenly pierced through the clouds and shone straight onto the bridge. At this moment, [Sudan] sat back in the wheelchair, kicking the door step by step. After no success, he turned and walked towards another door.
0:22:17|0:22:25|Unfortunately, just like before, no one came to answer this time, so he could only keep retreating in his wheelchair in the narrow room.
0:22:27|0:22:46|However, without paying attention, just as he turned the corner, his left foot hit the wooden cabinet in the corner straight on. At this moment, by the bustling river, [Fan Li] was standing at the taxi drop-off point, staring fixedly at the river. As cargo ships passed by in front of him one after another, [Fan Li] stood there blankly for a long time.
0:22:46|0:23:1|At this moment, a girl ran down from the minibus and patted him on the back. The sudden movement startled [Sudan], almost causing him to lose his balance and fall off the pier. Then he regained his composure and ran with the girl to the minibus behind him.
0:23:1|0:23:18|The girl is the one from the snack stall before, the one who made [Sudan] retreat lightly. Later, they took a vehicle to the other side of the river. The sunlight shone on the vast river surface, and the waves stirred up by the cruise ship instantly made it shimmer with millions of sparkling waves.
0:23:19|0:23:28|Gently watching [Sudan] sitting helplessly on the reef, [Fan Li] bent down and sat beside him after some thought. After looking at the river surface under their feet, she spoke.
0:23:33|0:23:37|[Xiao Chuan] heard this and snapped out of his daze, turning to look at [Qing Qing].
0:23:41|0:23:55|At this moment, a boy on the shore shouted at the two, and the boy, now in swimming trunks, jumped straight into the river. [Wu Tao] put away his melancholy mood and quickly stood up from the rocks.
0:23:57|0:24:10|Gently hearing the boy's urging, [Fan Li] also smiled and followed [Sudan] down the reef. After a moment, [Sudan] took off his long pants and polo shirt, sat on the rocks by the shore, and slowly moved towards the river.
0:24:10|0:24:25|Watching the turbulent river, he first tested the water with his feet, then walked aimlessly towards the right. Bathed in sunlight, he was wearing a short-sleeved shirt and sports pants. Before long, the girl, who was left with only her underwear, appeared in front of the stream.
0:24:26|0:24:40|With skin as white as jade, emitting a faint fragrance of youth. Then, gently placing clothes and glasses on the rocks, after seeing Xiao Chuan, she smiled at him, and then jumped straight into the river.
0:24:40|0:24:56|Watching his companions jump into the river one after another, [Wu Tao] suddenly closed his eyes and decisively followed their footsteps by leaping down. Happy times always pass quickly, and by now the sun had set. The three of them put on their clothes, got into the car they came in, and headed home.
0:25:6|0:25:21|The boy was driving the minibus, while Sudan stood behind Qingqing holding onto the rings on both sides with both hands, looking at her half-wet hair draped over her shoulders with a silly smile. But Qingqing's gaze was fixed on the boy driving.
0:25:21|0:25:28|Finally, watching Qingqing's hands placed on the pull-up bar, Sudan summoned up the courage this time and placed his right hand on the back of the other person's hand.
0:25:34|0:25:53|Upon hearing Qingqing's angry voice, Xiaochen quickly withdrew his hand, and the boy turned around in surprise to look at Qingqing. Qingqing stared at the boy sternly, who could only reluctantly step on the brake slowly. Seeing the door being opened, Qingqing quickly let go of the pull ring and walked down the minibus.
0:25:53|0:25:59|At a construction site filled with steel frames, [Fan Li] carried her school bag and walked away angrily.
0:26:0|0:26:10|The vehicle restarted, with [Wu Tao] sitting dejectedly in the back row, gritting his teeth and sighing repeatedly. Before long, the car stopped next to the factory where the railway tracks intersected.
0:26:22|0:26:36|Upon hearing the boy's derogatory words, [Sudan] frowned and left without looking back. The boy seemed determined to prove himself right, but as soon as [Sudan] took a step away, he stepped on the gas pedal and returned to the spot where Qingqing had temporarily gotten off the car.
0:26:38|0:26:50|Unexpectedly, in a place that was originally deserted, [Fan Li] emerged from behind a pile of steel pipes. Upon seeing the familiar Sino-Pakistani bus, she stood directly in the middle of the road, waiting for the vehicle to stop.
0:26:50|0:27:3|At this moment, the boy turned on the car lights and when he saw Qingqing in front of him, he smirked slightly, smiled at her, then pressed a switch and nodded his head, indicating something. After Qingqing got into the car, he quickly closed the door and drove away from the scene.
0:27:5|0:27:17|At this moment, in Xiao Chuan's home, [Sudan] is leaning against the back of the sofa, lifting his legs and swinging them in the air. Dejected Xiao Chuan opens the door, and through the plastic door curtain, he sees the scene that follows.
0:27:18|0:27:28|[Sudan] placed his left leg on the coffee table, bent his right leg, and slightly curled up his five toes, then slowly pulled on a thin, long stocking.
0:27:28|0:27:39|After putting on a long sock tightly above the knee, [Sudan] took out a fishnet stocking and slipped it on from the foot, slowly moving up to the calf, and finally tied it into an exquisite bow at the root of the thigh.
0:27:40|0:27:54|Soon after, she rubbed her right leg with satisfaction using both hands, and when she turned her head, she saw [Wu Tao] separated by a plastic door curtain outside the room. Feeling that it was inappropriate to peek, [Wu Tao] returned to her own room, sitting on the bed and covering her breath.
0:27:55|0:27:58|Sudan stopped in front of her door, turning his wheelchair.
0:28:3|0:28:8|When [Sudan] saw [Fan Li] approaching, he touched her hand with his raised left foot.
0:28:13|0:28:29|[Chuan]’s hand touched [Sudan]’s toes, quickly backing away, but the occasional shaking of his legs still stirred the young man's heart. However, he did not immediately agree. Several days later, [Chuan], the boy, and Qingqing met up again for another outing.
0:28:29|0:28:40|The boys and girls walked forward aimlessly along the railway tracks, facing the morning dew. But as they walked, the group that was originally walking side by side gradually became only [Wu Tao] leading the way at the front.
0:28:41|0:28:48|At this moment, [Sudan] gently stepped onto the narrow iron rails, with the boy quickly moving closer to him, showing a protective gesture.
0:28:57|0:29:15|A few days later, Xiao Chuan pushed [Sudan] and followed the salvager to the riverside. Before long, the salvager stopped at the dock and gestured for Xiao Chuan and himself to come forward. After a moment of hesitation, Xiao Chuan saw the salvager already lifting his foot and walking towards the body on the shore.
0:29:15|0:29:26|So he had to stop pushing [Sudan] and slowly walked towards the riverbank. But before he got close, he saw a mother and child holding a woven band, running towards the body floating in the river.
0:29:28|0:29:49|Watching her swollen loved one, the mother in this mother-son pair could no longer control her emotions, her wails of grief echoing incessantly. The men from the shore salvage team quickly pulled the woman away from the body. Sitting not far away, [Sudan] couldn't help but lower his head and take deep, heavy breaths as he watched the scene before him.
0:29:49|0:29:56|At this moment, Xiaochuan slowly turned back to [Sudan]'s side, walking while caressing his chest and abdomen.
0:29:57|0:30:9|Hearing the woman's heart-wrenching cry, coupled with the damp and foul-smelling wind blowing from the river behind her, she finally couldn't bear the physical and psychological pressure any longer, and knelt down in pain and vomited.
0:30:10|0:30:28|Spitting out in relief, feeling a bit lighter, and a bit more clear-headed. Then, Xiao Chuan spat to the side, slowly got up, clapped his hands, and stood up. After that, wiping his mouth casually, he staggered over and stood in front of [Sudan].
0:30:32|0:30:42|Watching little Chuan, who was smiling foolishly and feeling lucky that his father didn't die, [Sudan] propped up his chin with one hand, lips tightly closed, furrowing his brow, and stared at him motionlessly under the scorching sun.
0:30:42|0:31:3|After returning from the riverside, Sudan, who couldn't fall asleep for a long time, arrived at an abandoned car factory in the early hours of the morning. Recalling the bloated corpse, he now wandered alone among various scrapped vehicles in the cold moonlight. He opened the prepared flashlight to illuminate the front while feeling the car body to boost his courage.
0:31:3|0:31:22|After stepping over a piece of iron plate, he finally found the target he was looking for. At this moment, the fear also disappeared. Although the taxi in front of him had its driver's side door panel deformed and the front of the car was unrecognizable, [Xiao Chuan] still recognized at a glance that this was the taxi his father used to drive.
0:31:23|0:31:46|He hurriedly bypassed the car body, got into the passenger seat, and illuminated the interior of the driver's seat at close range. He first straightened his body to touch the broken front windshield, then knocked on the front storage box, and unexpectedly found the car key that had not been pulled out inside the car.
0:31:46|0:31:50|[As soon as Sudan turned the key, a melodious sound poured out from the stereo.]
0:31:54|0:32:17|The soothing and beautiful melody instantly relaxed him, but the slight movement still attracted the barking of the stray dogs in the parking lot. However, [Sudan] remained indifferent to this. Suddenly, a beam of light pierced through the night, revealing a tear slowly sliding down his face in the moonlight. And so, he sat there motionless for who knows how long.
0:32:20|0:32:42|Early the next morning, [Wu Tao] pushed [Sudan] to the unfinished bridge. In front of a spacious area, he danced wildly to the music. The young man exerted all his strength to move his limbs freely in the air, amidst the thick fog, sweat and dew intertwining with each other.
0:32:42|0:32:46|A cool morning breeze blew through, carrying the melody away after it had finished playing.
0:32:47|0:33:6|[Chuan] slowly closed his eyes and let himself immerse in the gentle melody once again. Dancing without direction, without focus, it seemed more like dancing without a home, as if his soul had long abandoned the music. Seeing this, [Sudan] nearby bent down, pressed pause, and turned off the CD player.
0:33:8|0:33:11|Xiaochuan, with hands on knees, responded upon hearing this.
0:33:27|0:33:35|Sudan, who had been staring motionless at Xiao Chuan, slowly turned his head upon hearing this, then bent down and pressed the button on the CD player again.
0:33:39|0:33:57|Upon hearing the music start again, [Sudan] once again vigorously waved his limbs. But the words he had just mustered up the courage to say seemed to have drained all his strength. The fists that could have broken through the sky and the legs that could have shattered the ground gradually lost their power, swaying weakly.
0:33:57|0:34:8|[Sudan] sat quietly in the distance, watching the teenager vent his emotions bit by bit. Meanwhile, at the other end, Mom Xiao Chuan was sitting on the toilet, lost in thought.
0:34:9|0:34:24|Sudan held a roll of toilet paper in one hand and a plastic stick-like object in the other. In the distance, a faucet that was not fully closed was dripping steadily. However, Fan Li, who was always careful with money, showed no reaction and kept staring at the plastic stick, furrowing her brow.
0:34:24|0:34:31|After coming out of the bathroom, [Fan Li] walked into the living room, picked up a glass and took a few big sips. She then looked up at the wall in front of her.
0:34:33|0:34:40|The wall plaster had long been soaked and peeled off, but the portrait of [Mr. Xiao Chuan] on the wall still smiled exceptionally brightly.
0:34:43|0:34:59|[Fan Li] kept muttering in her mouth and the next second she found herself back in the pet hospital where the film began. She gently caressed the big dog on the sickbed, but the hollow look in her eyes seemed to foretell the dog's fate.
0:34:59|0:35:6|The curly-haired man [Wu Tao], who is a dog owner, couldn't help but knock on the wall upon hearing the urgent and difficult sounds.
0:35:10|0:35:16|He then stormed into the ward and stood at the door, loudly reprimanding [Fan Li].
0:35:24|0:35:46|Listening to the accusations from [Wu Tao], [Fan Li] could no longer hold back. The tears that had been swirling in her eyes slid down her face and fell into the mask. She then turned around, sat weakly on the chair, took off the mask and headgear, and buried her face in her legs. [Wu Tao] awkwardly took out a few tissues.
0:35:50|0:36:14|Sitting next to [Fan Li], [Sudan] handed her the paper. Although Xiaochuan's mother took the paper, she showed no intention of wiping away tears, just sitting on the stool crying helplessly. Xiaoyi was at a loss for a moment, looked at Xiaochuan's mother, then touched his nose and spoke. After speaking, he glanced at Xiaochuan's mother again.
0:36:21|0:36:37|As soon as the words fell, Sudan, who had already fallen into a calm state, suddenly gasped again. The crying quickly elicited responses from the other puppies in the ward. Sudan reached out and held Fan Li's hand on her leg, releasing emotions drop by drop.
0:36:39|0:36:48|Late at night, a large truck roared past. Hearing Xiaoyi's question, [Fan Li] gradually came to her senses. Then, she took a deep breath and calmly spoke.
0:37:6|0:37:16|Mrs. Xiaochuan seemed to have suffered a great deal of grievances. The pent-up emotions that had been building up since her husband left were unleashed on [Wu Tao], this unfamiliar and young man, in full force.
0:37:18|0:37:28|Watching the woman next to him crying constantly, [Wu Tao] first put the tissue in his hand back on the table behind him, then adjusted his pocket, took out a piece of paper, thought for a moment, and spoke again.
0:37:36|0:37:54|The original was a business card, which was then handed to [Fan Li] by Sudan. Unconsciously, Sudan's mother clenched the card in her hand, and her mood gradually calmed down. A few days later, under the scorching sun, Aunt drove a small car slowly from outside the narrow lane.
0:37:54|0:38:0|Sudan parked the car, got out and walked straight towards Xiao Chuan's mother who was waiting in the distance.
0:39:6|0:39:28|Xiao Yi spoke earnestly. Then, the two of them left the health center. Xiao Yi, in order to prove the importance of psychological intervention, was driving with Xiao Chuan's mother on the main road at that moment. All the windows were rolled down, the music was turned up to the maximum, and the two people in the front seat were enjoying the thrill of speeding. Finally, the car stopped under a deserted tree shade.
0:39:28|0:39:34|Then you... Xiao Yi turned to Xiao Chun's mother, placing one hand on the back of the seat behind her.
0:39:41|0:39:49|Sudan spoke to the car door. Fan Li then touched her shoulder. Sudan lowered her head and looked at Fan Li who was close by.
0:40:7|0:40:34|As soon as the words fell, [Xiao Yi] stood up and pressed [Xiao Chuan's mother] down with force. Holding onto the seat belt, [Xiao Chuan's mother] looked at [Xiao Yi] above her and couldn't help but burst into laughter.
0:40:39|0:40:55|When it comes to Sudan, Fan Li quickly sat back in the driver's seat. To ease the awkwardness, the two walked side by side along the woods towards the direction of the observation deck.
0:40:57|0:41:5|Looking at the setting sun in front of her, [Fan Li] sighed and spoke. Without the boldness from before, she just turned her head to the other side.
0:41:13|0:41:30|[Mrs. Xiao] did not respond to [Xiao Yi]'s answer just now, but the mention of pregnancy made [Xiao Yi] slightly uneasy. His hands, which were originally hanging by his sides, were now tucked into his pants pockets. And so, the two of them stood on the observation deck, gazing at the river in the distance for a long, long time.
0:41:42|0:41:44|Masato Ogawa stood behind him, folding clothes.
0:41:48|0:42:5|After finishing, [Fan Li] neatly folded the clothes one by one into the wardrobe in the living room, while [Sudan] stared wide-eyed, motionless, at the person in the turbulent river in the distance, with both hands raised high above their head, struggling for dear life.
0:42:5|0:42:13|At this moment, [Sudan] regained consciousness, mechanically stuffing sunflower seeds into his mouth, then unconsciously spitting out the shells.
0:42:20|0:42:32|Xiao Chuan put on a coat at this moment, stood in front of the mirror full of anticipation, and smiled slightly at himself in the mirror. Outside, an ambulance roared past, and [Sudan] leaned against the window, staring blankly.
0:42:37|0:42:51|This sentence quickly woke up [Sudan] from his daze, and he turned his head to look behind him. Xiao Chuan was actually wearing a suit, but the thin boy's body naturally couldn't fill out the oversized clothes. After [Sudan] finished looking, he spat out a sunflower seed shell.
0:42:51|0:42:59|At night, [Sudan] first slices the pork belly, cuts the scallions and chili into shreds, then heats the wok and stir-fries them in order, flipping them left and right.
0:43:2|0:43:14|Then let Xiao Chuan season it, and when it's about to be served, [Sudan] hands Xiao Chuan a pair of chopsticks. After adjusting the seasoning, [Sudan] scoops the dish into the plate, with the slightly curled pork belly.
0:43:26|0:43:42|Mom Xiao walked from the bedroom to the table, tied her hair casually behind her head with a rubber band, and then picked up the wine on the table and returned to the kitchen. The three of them were eating silently when suddenly Xiao Chuan picked up a piece of meat and put it in his mother's bowl.
0:44:4|0:44:25|[Sudan]'s sudden voice made the mother and son stop their actions, then they both looked at him. However, he acted as if he hadn't seen them, picking up the dishes and putting the food into his bowl, eating it hungrily. But Xiao Chuan started to chew forcefully at this moment, showing his dissatisfaction. Xiao Chuan's mother couldn't help but start to scold him.
0:44:30|0:44:46|Xiao Chuan paused at this, stopped his head-down eating motion, glanced up at his mother, then aggressively shoveled a few bites of food into his mouth. He then stared straight at his mother, chewing harder and harder, even starting to shake his head and taunt her.
0:44:58|0:45:10|Sudan quickly tapped Xiao Chuan's head with chopsticks when he sensed that Mom Xiaochuan was about to explode. Xiao Chuan was caught off guard by this sudden lesson and could only bow his head, obediently eating the rice in his bowl.
0:45:12|0:45:30|After a peaceful meal, Xiao Chuan lay on the table, looking listlessly at the books in front of him. His mind was filled with the scene of being reprimanded, when [Sudan] lightly tapped his own calf with a high heel under the table. Outside the room, [Sudan] was carefully tying the shoelace of her high heels with her injured left foot.
0:45:30|0:45:35|Unfortunately, Sudan's left calf injury had not fully healed, causing the high heel she was holding to fall from the air.
0:45:36|0:45:55|Xiao Chuan heard the sound outside the house, and when he looked up, he saw a pair of slender and tender long legs, followed by fishnet stockings extending to the thigh of [Sudan]. But [Sudan], as if unaware of being watched, once again let her high heels fall off, and simply propped up her legs straight into the air.
0:46:2|0:46:22|Before long, the seductive atmosphere in the living room was completely shut out, but the sounds of repression, joy, and seemingly pain still seeped through the crack in the door and slipped into the teenager's bedroom. In a daze, [Fan Li] didn't know when he put on the diving goggles, then he slowly sat up from the bed and groped his way towards the bedroom door.
0:46:23|0:46:42|Due to the goggles covering his nose, the lenses quickly fogged up, causing Xiao Chuan to unconsciously reach out with his hands and slowly walk out of the bedroom. At this moment, there was no sign of [Sudan] on the sofa in the living room, so he curiously walked towards the bathroom.
0:46:42|0:46:51|Just as they turned the corner, [Sudan] emerged from the restroom leaning on a cane, slowly moving towards the sofa, showcasing their good figure to the fullest as they walked.
0:47:7|0:47:23|He turned his head to look out the window, and the distant suspension tower was right in front of him. But in an instant, all the scenery in front of him suddenly started spinning, it turned out that everything just now was a beautiful dream that Xiao Chuan had while sleeping.
0:47:23|0:47:32|A gust of cool wind drove away the summer heat, passing through the window onto his green face, Sudan opened his sleepy eyes and looked at the ceiling.
0:47:32|0:47:46|Sudan then turned his head towards the pillow, the brand new packaging of the goggles and respirator still intact. After a moment of contemplation, he took the packaging of the goggles, removed it in a few swift motions, and then put it on his head.
0:47:46|0:47:56|After his nose and eyes were completely covered, he adjusted his breathing while trying to adapt. At this moment, as if remembering something, he suddenly showed a faint smile.
0:47:57|0:48:8|By the railway outside the bankrupt house, [Fan Li] transformed her image easily, wearing a skirt and leaning against the door of the minibus. After swinging her legs, she smiled at the approaching person.
0:48:14|0:48:16|Qingqing took off her glasses.
0:48:27|0:48:46|The boy who was swimming by the river now walked from the driver's seat to behind Qingqing, putting his arm around her shoulder and speaking to Xiaochuan. [Sudan] saw this, patted Xiaochuan's hand behind him, took off his sunglasses, greeted the two in front of him, and then the four of them walked into the woods beside the railway track.
0:48:55|0:49:16|[Sudan] looked at the boy in front of him, the boy's hands pushing on [Sudan]'s wheelchair. As soon as he spoke, the boy grabbed the wheelchair's armrests tightly and pulled it towards himself with force.
0:49:19|0:49:43|The boy kept ramming the wheelchair against the car door. [Sudan] did not get angry at the boy's behavior, but just lifted his head and stared straight at him. Unable to get any useful information from [Sudan], the boy turned to look at Xiaochuan. [Sudan] placed his hands on the boy's cheeks.
0:49:46|0:49:54|Speak up, with a strong push, the boy was pushed straight onto the tracks behind him. After this incident, the four people dispersed calmly.
0:49:56|0:50:15|Not far away, [Sudan] pushed his wheelchair straight ahead. The boy looked at his back and shouted loudly at [Fan Li] from the driver's seat. Perhaps it was his words that made [Fan Li] suspicious. At three thirty in the morning, he unexpectedly arrived at the entrance of the KTV, sitting bored on the road bollard.
0:50:42|0:50:58|Soon, the taxi slowly accelerated away from the original location. After leaving the brightly lit urban area, it drove against the wind across the bridge over the river. Sitting in the passenger seat, [Wu Tao] occasionally looked down at the watch on his wrist. Before long, they arrived at the dock.
0:50:58|0:51:3|The taxi slowly slid down from the top of the slope, then headed towards the guardrail at the dock.
0:51:13|0:51:32|[Sudan] urged the driver while checking the watch, as the car was about to crash into the guardrail and plunge into the river. The driver glanced at [Sudan] and slammed on the brakes to stop. [Sudan] seemed to have no complaints, but instead turned on the backlight of the watch, which showed 4:06 AM.
0:51:34|0:51:54|In the early morning on the construction site of the bridge, two people were seen fighting in the distance. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be [Sudan] and the boy who drove the minibus. Due to being a head shorter than the other and having a very slim build, [Sudan] was quickly pinned down and beaten by the other. After returning home empty-handed from fishing, he locked himself in the bathroom.
0:51:54|0:52:13|Taking off his shirt, standing in front of the mirror, he looked at himself with blood at the corner of his mouth from being beaten. The frequent knocking on the door quickly made him impatient. He turned around and forcefully pulled open the door of the bathroom, only to find [Sudan] standing there. It turned out that the boy was called Da Zhi, and [Fan Li] sat on the toilet in silence, feeling upset.
0:52:13|0:52:18|[Sudan] leaned coolly against the side, taking a towel and reaching out to [Fan Li].
0:52:22|0:52:30|Fan Li wiped the injured corner of her mouth, Sudan straightened up, changed the towel to the other side, and leaned towards Fan Li again.
0:52:34|0:52:52|Next, [Sudan] rushed forward with a crutch to the other side of [Fan Li], and after the battle was settled, he pressed the towel against his cheeks and chest. As [Sudan] wiped, the ends of his hair kept brushing against [Fan Li]'s face, and the boy, wearing only underwear, quickly lost control of his breathing.
0:52:54|0:53:11|But when [Sudan] once again bent over to check the wound on [Fan Li]'s chest, she grabbed his wrist and forcefully pushed him away. Unexpectedly, in a moment of carelessness, he ended up being pinned down by her. Then, wearing goggles on her head and only a pair of underwear, [Fan Li] pushed [Sudan] out of the door.
0:53:11|0:53:19|He pushed [Sudan] through one damp, coarse concrete area after another, paying no attention to how extraordinary and vulgar they looked.
0:53:28|0:53:52|In the meantime, the two arrived at the dock. With just three more steps forward, [Sudan] would fall into the river. Xiao Chuan gripped the handles of the wheelchair tightly, lowered his head and said fiercely. Seeing [Sudan] shaking his head, he pushed forward with force. At this moment, [Sudan] still shook his head.
0:53:57|0:54:16|Finally, with half of the people and wheelchairs already hanging over the river, [Sudan] was so scared that tears welled up in his eyes, but he remained silent. The raging river water beneath his feet crashed against the shore, waves overlapping one after another, making a huge noise. [Sudan]'s future was just a thought away behind the small stream.
0:54:17|0:54:22|At this moment, the clouds dispersed and the sun shone directly on the two figures by the dock.
0:54:22|0:54:42|The cold and damp air seemed to be driven away by the sunlight, and the rising temperature quickly brought [Sudan] back to his senses from the shock. At the same time, it also restored Little River's sanity, causing him to take a step back and pull the wheelchair back to the ground. Finally, [Sudan] also let out a sigh of relief, took a deep breath, and hung his head heavily.
0:54:42|0:54:59|With her eyes closed to calm her emotions, Sudan sat quietly. Xiao Chuan glanced at her, no longer feeling the previous impulse, so he could only turn the wheelchair around and head back the way they came. Finally, it was time for the follow-up appointment. On a sunny morning, Xiao Chuan's mother brought [Sudan] to the hospital.
0:54:59|0:55:7|[Sudan] sat in the hospital room, boredly watching the machine being operated by [Fan Li] above his left leg, and finally couldn't help but speak up.
0:55:9|0:55:12|However, the doctor's silence made her extremely nervous.
0:55:16|0:55:42|Mrs. Xiao stood at the door of the ward, watching. Different doctors responded, Mrs. Xiao suddenly covered her mouth, ran outside. In the women's restroom, she was bending over and vomiting into the sink, then she said. [Sudan] sat at the door, glanced at Mrs. Xiao after hearing it.
0:55:46|0:55:57|Watching the shocked [Sudan], Xiao Chuan's mother turned her head to divert the water pipe, then she picked up cold water with both hands and kept splashing it on her face. After pursing her lips, she pushed [Sudan] out of the hospital.
0:56:13|0:56:17|The two arrived at an old factory. In the factory, a large boiler was burning steel and iron.
0:57:2|0:57:17|During the conversation, [Sudan] and [Fan Li] had already left the roaring boiler and arrived at a platform. In the distance was an old dilapidated factory building, and behind them was a high-temperature incinerator. Reflecting on his mediocre life, [Sudan] suddenly couldn't help but start panting.
0:57:18|0:57:37|Watching the wheelchair suddenly stop, [Sudan] first looked back at Xiao Chuan's mother, then looked ahead again. He slowly raised his right hand, gently patting Xiao Chuan's mother's back of the hand. Feeling the silent comfort from [Sudan], Xiao Chuan's mother's shoulders, which had been rising and falling, paused, her gasping gradually stopped, and she finally returned home.
0:57:55|0:58:16|[Sudan] unbuttoned Xiao Chuan's mother's blouse, revealing her not-so-plump chest. Then, the two of them stood in front of the mirror. [Sudan] applied her own lipstick to moisturize Xiao Chuan's mother's lips.
0:58:23|0:58:33|Xiao Chuan's mother took off her flat shoes and put on a pair of dazzling high heels. Before the words had even finished, she had already put on one of them.
0:58:57|0:59:13|[Sudan] excitedly looked at the mother of Xiao Chuan in front of him, sincerely praising her standing. As the sun sets in the west, a group of middle-aged people are taking a group photo with their backs to the river on the viewing platform next to the exquisite dining table. The makeup on [Fan Li]'s mother does make her look more radiant than her peers.
0:59:22|0:59:27|Although it was a class reunion, Xiao Yi unexpectedly sat next to [Fan Li]'s mother and engaged in lively conversations with the people around.
0:59:29|0:59:47|On the other side, contrary to the lively gathering of classmates, Xiao Chuan is at home tidying up the bathroom. He first hangs the washcloth on the valve of the water pipe, then lights a cigarette, takes down the already dried towel from the clothes rack, hangs the towel on the valve of the water pipe, and finally lifts a chair and places it in the empty space in front of the water pipe.
0:59:48|0:59:59|Continuing, Xiao Chuan sat on the chair and leaned back, feeling the comfort, then pushed [Sudan] from outside into the toilet, carefully helping him sit on the same chair.
0:59:59|1:0:11|At this moment, [Sudan] bent his injured left leg and placed it on the pedal, watching Xiaochuan wrap his own leg with plastic wrap round after round. In the damp and stuffy restroom, the two of them were already dressed in cool clothing.
1:0:12|1:0:18|In addition, [Sudan] was wearing a camisole and fishnet stockings, and Xiao Chuan was soon sweating profusely.
1:0:18|1:0:35|It was a coincidence that, while wrapping the plastic wrap around the calf of [Sudan], Xiaochuan's back of the hand accidentally brushed against the inner thigh of [Sudan], the smooth and sticky touch made Xiaochuan pause, but soon he continued wrapping the plastic wrap, covering it up very quickly.
1:0:35|1:0:41|But [Sudan] bent over the spot that had just been grazed the next second, making Xiao Chuan break out in a cold sweat.
1:0:42|1:0:59|Thinking he had already endured the tough times, but hearing the gushing sound of water in the bathroom, Xiao Chuan couldn't help but sit in [Sudan]'s wheelchair, wandering around the house like a headless fly. It seemed like he was trying to cover up the magical sound with the noise of friction with the ground.
1:0:59|1:1:7|But no matter how he walked, the location of the toilet seemed to be like a magnet, attracting him to eventually walk in that direction.
1:1:17|1:1:21|A tumor on his calf that is ten centimeters long makes [Sudan] unable to help but complain.
1:1:25|1:1:42|The small stream that was originally standing far away couldn't help but approach, trying to get a clear view of the scar that refused to disappear. However, before reaching the bedside, [Sudan] angrily grabbed a pillow and threw it at the small stream, then sat up from the bed, took the crutch, and limped out of the ward.
1:1:49|1:2:3|Left in the hospital room, Xiao Chuan watched as [Sudan]'s stubborn figure, but still couldn't say a harsh word. However, once back home, [Sudan] completely let down his guard, lying on the sofa, lifting his legs up towards the sky and pondering for a while.
1:2:4|1:2:22|He, who was still smiling, suddenly turned his mouth down and burst into a cry of pain. Xiao Chuan was approaching with a water cup at this time, wondering whether to turn around and leave, so that [Sudan] could vent alone. Before the water cup could be put down, he held his waist with both hands and firmly embraced it in front of him.
1:2:23|1:2:38|This sudden move left [Fan Li] at a loss, but there was no sign of refusal. So, [Sudan] simply buried his head in [Fan Li]'s abdomen and cried heartily. [Fan Li] also gradually placed her hands on [Sudan]'s shoulders, unconsciously rubbing them.
1:2:39|1:2:57|After he finally calmed down, [Fan Li] turned back to his room. He pulled out a toolbox from under the bed and then walked back to the living room. [Sudan], lying sideways on the sofa, kept pulling back his scarred left leg, but couldn't resist the strength of [Fan Li].
1:2:57|1:3:5|Soon, he obediently placed his left leg on the opponent's thigh. Then, [Fan Li] opened the box and took out a paintbrush from it.
1:3:6|1:3:19|After dabbing on the paint, he began creating around the scars. Watching [Fan Li] earnestly turn her face to the side, [Sudan] also lost his initial resistance and instead propped his arm under his head, staring firmly at [Fan Li].
1:3:19|1:3:32|Just like that, Xiao Chuan held [Sudan]'s slender ankle firmly, drawing for a long time until the desired shape was completely outlined, then took out another pen and filled in the colors bit by bit.
1:3:40|1:3:49|Xiao Chuan turned his head to look at [Sudan] on the other side of the sofa, then continued to lower his head to draw. However, [Sudan] suddenly sat up.
1:4:2|1:4:19|[Sudan] raised his hand and patted Xiaochuan on the head, then lay back down, watching him continue drawing on his own legs. In the corner of the living room, Xiaochuan's mother had returned at some point, and upon hearing the conversation between the two, she leaned against the wall, raised her head, and stared out the window.
1:4:19|1:4:35|It's late at night, and the only thing in this home that seems to still hold a smile is the picture of Dad Xiao Chuan hanging on the wall. In the quiet house, light seeps out from under the door of Xiao Chuan's bedroom. Upon closer inspection, it is revealed that he has once again brought out a cigarette.
1:4:35|1:4:46|At this moment, he was using a carving knife to slowly polish the appearance of [Sudan], the tree-like hair behind the head, full chest, and slender legs, making it clear who the carved person was.
1:4:47|1:5:3|Outside on the sofa, [Sudan] was sleeping soundly under a thin blanket, with his left leg intentionally exposed, revealing the pattern tattooed by Xiao Chuan. After all the paint had dried, two palm-sized flowers bloomed brightly, completely covering up the ugly scar.
1:5:3|1:5:11|By the communal water pool outside the house, [Sudan] was delicately washing the dishes after dinner, everything seemed so eerie yet inexplicably harmonious.
1:5:13|1:5:34|Perhaps hearing what [Sudan] said, the next morning, [Fan Li] made an appointment with [Wu Tao] to meet downstairs. In the bustling morning market, with people coming and going, [Fan Li] ran down the long street and hurried towards [Wu Tao] at the street corner.
1:5:41|1:5:48|[Su Dan] stood facing [Fan Li], hands hanging at the sides of his pants, tilting his head with a blank expression.
1:5:48|1:6:2|Upon hearing the insults from [Xiao Chuan], [Qing Qing] unexpectedly lifted the corners of her mouth again. Meanwhile, [Xiao Chuan] was like a bow, gesturing towards the direction of the long street in front of him. It turned out that [Sudan] was standing there with a cane.
1:6:2|1:6:7|[Chuan] originally wanted to leave with a smile, but when he heard [Qingqing] calling his name, he returned to where he was.
1:6:12|1:6:24|Watching [Sudan] pretend to be cool, [Fan Li] gently lowered her head and pursed her lips, then walked forward, and embraced [Sudan] with her arms around his shoulders.
1:6:33|1:6:58|In the moment of being hugged, [Sudan]'s expression has softened, and now there is a hint of avoidance in his eyes. The current [Fan Li] has already discarded her bulky glasses and even put on earrings. Glancing at the dazed [Sudan], she smiles and turns away.
1:7:1|1:7:29|In the narrow and crowded corridor, [Sudan] greeted the neighbor who was playing cards, then carried a big bag of vegetables towards home. [Sudan] held a basin and kept sprinkling water on the ground, telling the two to behave, and finally walked up to lower the volume of the TV.
1:7:34|1:7:36|Drag the water on the ground away bit by bit.
1:7:44|1:7:57|Hearing [Xiao Chuan's mother]'s response, [Sudan] didn't mind at all, but instead chuckled at the TV screen. [Xiao Chuan] sat beside her, holding peeled oranges in her hands, watching TV and stuffing them into her mouth.
1:7:57|1:8:7|Watching the two of them not lifting a finger to help clean up the house, [Mrs. Xiao Chuan] was filled with anger. She kicked away [Sudan]'s shoes placed next to the sofa and vigorously pulled the mop back and forth.
1:8:9|1:8:20|At this moment, [Sudan] turned his head and lifted his legs in the air, making room for [Fan Li] to mop the floor. After a moment of thought, he got up and walked towards the depths of the living room.
1:8:21|1:8:32|[Xiao Chuan] walked to the window, turned the air conditioner to the maximum, then sat back next to [Sudan], ate a piece of orange, and turned up the volume of the TV.
1:8:42|1:9:1|Upon hearing this, [Sudan]'s mother immediately stopped mopping the floor, then fiercely threw the mop to the ground and picked up a wooden stick, chasing after her son out of the house.
1:9:9|1:9:21|Before long, the two of them ran into the vegetable market. The neighbors seemed unfazed by their presence.
1:9:29|1:9:35|Before long, [Sudan] stopped in her tracks, watching as [Fan Li] gradually disappeared at the end of the road.
1:9:40|1:9:43|[Sudan] is lying on the stone chair by the river, applying medicine to Xiao Chuan.
1:9:48|1:9:58|[Sudan] stopped what he was doing and Xiao Chuan also straightened up, looking back at him. Early in the morning, Xiao Chuan's mother yawned as she arrived at the bus stop on the street.
1:9:58|1:10:8|The scorching sun overhead, he, who was still waiting for the bus with no shelter in sight, could only shield his eyes with his hand against the glare, luckily the bus arrived shortly after.
1:10:13|1:10:32|In the clinic, [Sudan] held the microphone and answered the other party very respectfully. After gently hanging up the phone, she took a deep breath, closed her eyes, then turned to look out the window. But when she touched the mirror behind her, she firmly fixed her gaze on herself, due to the hot environment.
1:10:33|1:10:53|The two patients were already sticking wet on their faces, looking very tired. The next day, [Fan Li] specially changed into a beautiful dress and sat in the front passenger seat of Xiao Yi. Seeing Xiao Yi remaining silent, she boldly leaned over, gently kissed him, and left a mark on his cheek.
1:10:53|1:10:56|Then he sat back in his seat and stared straight out the window.
1:11:0|1:11:24|Upon hearing Xiaoyi's question, [Fan Li] withdrew her gaze, lowered her head and softly responded. Not far from them was a magnificent hotel, towering majestically in the city center, overlooking the entire city. As night fell, [Fan Li] arrived at the theater. Inside the theater, the troupe leader gathered everyone together.
1:11:33|1:11:38|But only [Fan Li] leaned against the door of the rehearsal hall, drinking from a bottle of wine in big gulps.
1:11:41|1:11:46|After helping her calm down, the choir's first rehearsal officially began.
1:11:46|1:12:3|The team members lined up neatly in two rows, with the height decreasing from the middle to the sides. The men in short sleeves and trousers stood at the back, while the women in knee-length skirts stood in the front row. [Wu Tao] stood in the middle of the team with hands folded in front of him, eyes closed and asleep.
1:12:28|1:12:47|After hesitating for a while, [Sudan] gently put down his crutch, knelt on the carpet with one leg first, and then slowly lay down beside Xiaochuan. At this moment, a mold with undulating patterns appeared in front of [Sudan] under the bed. Xiaochuan heard his question, turned his head to look at him, and then twisted open the light bulb at the bed board.
1:12:49|1:12:58|The originally blurry ceiling was instantly illuminated by a warm light, revealing the microcosm of the city in front of the two characters.
1:12:58|1:13:12|Next, Xiaochuan twisted another switch, and the edge of the microscopic scene instantly lit up with a string of nail-sized light bulbs. Following [Sudan]'s gaze, the microscopic scene completely replicated the city's real appearance one-to-one.
1:13:13|1:13:20|Not only because of the still under construction bridge, but also the old factories standing near the Xiao Chuan's house.
1:13:40|1:13:57|Xiao Chuan smiled and pointed to the masterpiece under his bed, even blowing out a puff of smoke from the factory chimney he had created to simulate abandonment. Xiao Chuan's mother, still singing passionately in the rehearsal hall, was completely unaware of this. Naturally, she had no idea.
1:13:57|1:14:3|The two people were lying side by side on the bed, laughing happily.
1:14:19|1:14:38|At some point, the two who were originally shoulder to shoulder had their shoulders touching. Their dangling feet in the air even collided with each other, with [Fan Li] daringly using the heel of his foot to touch [Sudan]'s toes, while discreetly turning his head to stare at his smiling face, forgetting to look away for a long time.
1:14:38|1:14:56|After going through rehearsal after rehearsal, [Sudan]'s mother shed tears of emotion. As the night grew late, the figure that had been lying under the bed was now only [Sudan] alone. Slowly turning off the light of the microscope, she carefully lowered the curtain and then lay back on the bed.
1:14:56|1:15:5|In the living room outside, [Sudan] lay on the sofa with one arm under her cheek, appearing to be asleep, but her wide-open eyes betrayed her troubled expression.
1:15:7|1:15:17|For a long time, after finishing the rehearsal, [Fan Li] returned home and saw [Sudan]'s legs with flowers drawn on them, realizing that her white legs were directly facing the door of [Fan Li]'s room.
1:15:17|1:15:26|Sudan turned his head in disgust, bent down to cover the gorgeous flower with a thin blanket, then quietly made his way to the other end of the sofa and sat down on a separate chair.
1:15:27|1:15:47|Then, with hands gently placed in front of him, bending at the waist and squinting, he stared at [Sudan] who was sound asleep on the sofa. Perhaps his gaze was too intense, as [Sudan] suddenly woke up from his dream, looked up at [Fan Li] in front of him, and quickly sat up.
1:15:47|1:16:0|Upon hearing this sudden news, [Sudan] straightened his body and then looked towards the boat mother. The boat mother was resolute, with no room for negotiation.
1:16:9|1:16:25|Mom Xiao Chuan stood up straight, and fiercely confronted [Sudan]. But [Sudan] seemed as if the one being scolded was not himself, holding his head high and staring motionlessly at Mom Xiao Chuan. In the end, Mom Xiao Chuan was the first to avoid the eye contact, shrugged her shoulders and slowly lowered her head.
1:16:25|1:16:35|The next morning, Sudan's mother arrived at a magnificent hotel lobby. Just as Fan Li was about to walk over to Sudan's mother, he was stopped by four burly men.
1:16:44|1:16:57|Xiao Yi pinched the plastic bag in his hand, then lowered his head and walked straight towards [Xiao Chuan's mother] past the four people in front of him.
1:17:9|1:17:13|Mrs. Xiaochuan tightened her grip on the plastic bag in her hand, then looked behind Xiaoyi.
1:17:15|1:17:23|Xiao Yi smiled and waved behind him, then looked at the mother in front of him, and opened his mouth.
1:17:23|1:17:36|Next, Sudan looked up and down at Fan Li, then smiled and turned away. Before he had gone far, he was grabbed by the tallest and strongest man among the four, who twisted his neck and dragged him into the depths of the hotel as if cutting his face.
1:17:37|1:17:55|[Mrs. Xiao Chuan] raised her foot and looked in the direction where the five people left. Then she tightened the plastic bag in her hand, thought for a moment, stuffed it into her shoulder bag, and hurriedly left the hotel. After leaving the hotel, [Mrs. Xiao Chuan] did not immediately go home, but went to the health center in the city.
1:17:55|1:18:14|On the wooden table, a large number of one and five yuan bills are neatly stacked. [Ma Dongmei] unfolds the crumpled bills one by one and flattens them with the bottom of a hot water tank.
1:18:14|1:18:18|Continuing to repeat the action of rolling the ten yuan banknote out of the plastic bag.
1:18:19|1:18:37|Then, they pressed and sorted the bundles one by one, securely tied them with rubber bands, and finally put all the banknotes back into the bag. A few days later, [Mrs. Xiao Chuan] and [Sudan] came to the hospital. Sitting quietly on the stone chairs in the corridor, they were one meter apart.
1:18:37|1:18:48|[Mrs. Xiao Chuan] thought for a moment, unzipped the bag, took out a plastic bag from inside, casually flipped through it, and revealed bundles of banknotes to hand over to [Sudan].
1:18:50|1:18:55|[Sudan] didn't even look at it. Seeing this, [Mrs. Xiao Chuan] had no choice but to put the money on the chair.
1:19:1|1:19:8|[Sudan] held a crutch in one hand, his eyes staring blankly ahead, unaware even as his short sleeves slipped off his shoulders.
1:19:18|1:19:26|Mrs. Xiao Chuan crossed her legs, folded her arms, and took a deep breath after a nurse walked past them. Then she turned her head and said.
1:20:13|1:20:19|As soon as the music stopped, Xiaochuan's mother picked up the 20,000 yuan and handed it to [Sudan] not far away.
1:20:25|1:20:36|After saving the large sum of cash that was crucial to her, [Sudan] looked at Xiao Chuan's mother with moist eyes, then leaned on her cane with one hand and made her way to the staircase with a fist and a crutch.
1:20:36|1:20:53|A few months later, in the same beautifully decorated KTV, a group of eight girls in off-the-shoulder mini skirts lined up in a triangular formation and walked slowly towards the front desk. Even in the dim lighting, you could still see the slender figures of the girls.
1:20:53|1:21:1|Passing by the front desk, Sudan, Fan Li, and Wu Tao tacitly took signs from the bartender one by one, then scattered and headed towards different private rooms.
1:21:2|1:21:21|After passing through one private room after another, only a female manager was left at the front of the group. Then she pushed open a private room door, and indeed the person inside was [Sudan]. But as soon as she saw the face of the customer in front of her, the smile that had been on her face instantly froze.
1:21:21|1:21:27|Sudan quickly raised the corners of his mouth and calmly asked, the guest turned out to be none other than Xiao Chuan.
1:21:32|1:21:45|[Sudan] walked over to the sofa with his cane, but [Xiao Chuan] remained motionless after hearing it. [Xiao Chuan] was wearing a loose suit with rolled-up sleeves, one foot resting on the coffee table filled with plates of food and drinks.
1:21:48|1:22:1|[Chuan] once again danced in front of [Sudan] to the tune of this song. In his excitement, he took off his suit and threw it over [Sudan]'s head, then grabbed a glass of wine and started pouring it crazily into his own mouth.
1:22:1|1:22:11|Before long, the two of them raised their glasses and drank heartily. [Sudan] even grabbed the microphone and started playing a single on repeat, dancing wildly on the sofa and coffee table with [Xiao Chuan].
1:22:13|1:22:23|The hustle and bustle dissipated, [Sudan] hailed a taxi and helped the already drunk [Xiao Chuan] into the back seat. Not feeling assured, he then crouched down and sat beside him.
1:22:23|1:22:32|Soon, the taxi left the bustling downtown area and headed towards the riverbank. Watching the turbulent river under the moonlight, [Sudan] suddenly felt very bored.
1:22:34|1:22:52|Therefore, he rolled down the window and leaned against the car door, watching the taxi heading towards the dilapidated road. Suddenly, he felt a weight on his shoulder. [Xiao Chuan], who was originally leaning against the seat back, rested his head on his shoulder. And so, the two of them drove towards the hotel by the river.
1:22:52|1:23:2|[Ogawa] lay on the bed, propping up his eyelids, watching [Sudan] muttering beside him. [Sudan] lay back silently. Ogawa persisted and spoke again.
1:23:5|1:23:14|Before speaking, Xiao Chuan boldly wrapped his left arm around [Sudan]'s waist and stared at his face, which was close at hand, saying seriously.
1:23:30|1:23:56|The uncomfortable sensation of being drunk suddenly surged up. [Fan Li] swallowed his saliva and lowered his head to say softly. In the midst of speaking, [Fan Li] could no longer resist the effects of alcohol and closed his eyes.
1:24:13|1:24:26|As soon as the words fell, Xiaochuan completely lay his head at the foot of the bed, but [Sudan] suddenly opened his eyes. However, Xiaochuan fell asleep completely this time, naturally not hearing [Sudan]'s response.
1:24:26|1:24:40|Sudan, who was originally lying at the foot of the bed, felt the hot breath of Wu Tao imprisoned by his waist and ears. He carefully pushed her aside and then turned his head, sleeping alone on the pillow at the head of the bed.
1:24:41|1:25:0|In his sleep, Xiaochuan kept changing positions, as if he would sleep when tired and eat when hungry, instinctively searching for the position of [Sudan]. At this moment in his dream, he returned to the riverside where the accident happened. In the dream, he finally put on goggles and a simple breathing apparatus, the whole set of diving equipment.
1:25:0|1:25:21|Early in the morning, braving the heavy dew, [Wu Tao] tightly clad in swim trunks walked towards the railing by the river on foot. Perhaps due to the early hour, there was no one around privately, and the distant river surface was also no longer as busy as before, with only two or three boats passing by. Slowly, [Wu Tao] stood at the railing with a full set of diving equipment.
1:25:21|1:25:26|Looking into the distance through the goggles, then lowered his head to look at the rolling river water at his feet.
1:25:27|1:25:47|Recalling the moment when she heard her mother warning her not to go into the water at the dinner table, as well as [Sudan] mentioning someone accidentally falling into the water, she took a deep breath, then slowly retreated backwards. The next moment, finally summoning up her courage, she ran wildly for nearly ten meters, and then leaped straight down through the gap in the railing.
1:25:47|1:25:53|The splashes may be big, but they are nothing compared to the surging waves. In the blink of an eye, two years have passed.
1:26:11|1:26:28|Watching her daughter about to wake up from sleeping on the pointed head, [Sudan] gently patted her daughter's back and walked back and forth in the living room. After taking the passbook, [Sudan] turned back to her own room, then pulled back the curtain at the end of the bed, turned on the switch, revealing the room of the micro city.
1:26:31|1:26:40|However, the current appearance of this city's miniature is no longer as dazzling as it was two years ago, with dust covering the mold, causing [Wu Tao] to sneeze uncontrollably.
1:26:42|1:26:56|Holding the Tutsi man belonging to [Sudan] in his hand, [Fan Li] who got the address from his mother quickly set out on the journey to find someone. In the days filled with birdsong and fragrance, away from the hustle and bustle of the city, [Fan Li] arrived at a small village in front of a big mountain.
1:26:56|1:27:11|Taking off the torn shirt and putting on a button-up shirt, he now looks quite mature. But the next moment, in front of an old house with blue tiles, he drops his pretense of maturity. At the end of the old house, a noodle and steamed bun shop steals his gaze.
1:27:20|1:27:36|[Sudan], no longer in the image of suspenders, fishnet stockings, and super short skirts, changed into the most ordinary short-sleeved shorts, smiling goodbye to the customers coming for breakfast. After putting the change into the wooden box on the roadside, as usual, she picked up a few eggs and put them in the pot beside her.
1:27:36|1:27:43|Just as he was about to find a moment to rest in the shop, he looked up and saw [Wu Tao] sitting at the nearest table, seemingly out of nowhere.
1:27:44|1:27:49|When they met, [Sudan] took the wallet with one hand and pulled a chair to sit next to [Xiao Chuan].
1:27:55|1:28:7|[Sudan] smiled at [Fan Li] as he opened his wallet to give change to the customer. Despite the simple surroundings, [Fan Li] smiled sincerely, but soon his smile faded from his face.
1:28:7|1:28:18|At this moment, [Sudan] seemed to realize something was wrong. After giving the change to the customer, he followed Xiao Chuan's gaze to his wallet in his hand, then looked up to meet Xiao Chuan's questioning and angry eyes.
1:28:20|1:28:39|[Sudan] also quickly restrained her smile, pinched the money in her hand, and carefully tucked it into her wallet. At the top of the transparent compartment in the wallet, there was a photo of her and Xiao Chuan's dad with their cheeks pressed together. [Sudan]'s thoughts at this moment also returned to the moment when she first met Xiao Chuan's dad.
1:28:39|1:28:46|Drunk, [Fan Li] left the KTV and sat in the front passenger seat of Xiao Chuan's father's taxi, leaning against the car door and vomiting wildly from outside the car.
1:28:57|1:29:16|[Sudan] wiped the corners of his mouth, holding a tissue in his hand, and said angrily. After leaving the bustling city area, Xiaochuan's father suddenly stopped on a remote road. Xiaochuan's father turned his head to look at [Sudan]. Xiaochuan's father gripped the steering wheel and said solemnly.
1:29:20|1:29:38|The engine roared in the night, [Sudan] leaned against the car door, looking at the stern-faced Xiaochuan's father. He lowered his hand from his forehead, originally wanting to leave with a sneer on his face, but when he turned his head and saw how serious Xiaochuan's father was, he had to sit up straight, lifting his head to look directly at Xiaochuan's father.
1:29:53|1:30:10|The two arrived at a rooftop, reminiscing about the past, then [Sudan] spoke again. At that moment, a gentle breeze blew by, once again taking [Sudan] back to that summer. On a narrow alley that had not yet been opened up by the camera, a taxi was slowly driving.
1:30:10|1:30:22|Suddenly, a person wearing a helmet and protective gear on all limbs fell out of the passenger seat. Then, the taxi reversed back with this person and repeated the same action after stepping on the gas pedal.
1:30:23|1:30:30|After the person in the passenger seat was thrown out onto the ground, a driver dressed the same as him also jumped out from the driver's seat.
1:30:31|1:30:50|After practicing over and over again, the two parked the car in the middle of the road, then leaned against the back to relax. As they approached, it turned out to be Xiao Chuan's dad and [Sudan]. With the sun rising and setting, they seemed to have forgotten about time, increasing the throttle time and time again, jumping down from their respective positions without hesitation.
1:30:50|1:30:57|Success comes to those who work hard. When they achieved satisfactory results, they supported each other and left in the car.
1:31:2|1:31:6|After listening to this account, Sudan still harbored great doubts about the day his father had the accident.
1:31:12|1:31:30|Hearing Xiao Chuan's question, [Sudan] picked up a cup of tea, took a sip, and then began to recall. In the early hours of the morning, the clean and bright marble floor set off [Sudan]'s delicate figure, and the refreshing leather skirt with suspenders highlighted her good figure.
1:31:30|1:31:36|At the KTV exit, Sudan saw Xiaochuan's father sitting in the driver's seat outside, carrying a bag of snacks and drinks as he walked straight ahead.
1:31:39|1:31:53|[Sudan] sat on the hood, took out a mirror to touch up her makeup. Mr. Xiao Chuan leaned on the other side of the hood, opened the bag of drinks and smiled in response.
1:32:18|1:32:28|After finishing the last sip of wine, Xiaochuan's father stood up straight, leaning against the hood just like [Sudan], and ate a shrimp stick while looking into the distance, his eyes full of new hope.
1:32:30|1:32:51|Continuing, the two of them turned back to the car. [Sudan] propped his elbow on the car door, unconsciously raised his hand in front of him, continuously biting his nails. Then he raised his hand to touch his forehead, casually playing with his hair. Amidst the sound of Mr. Xiaochuan cutting the brake line, he finally made up his mind and firmly grasped the handle above the car door.
1:32:51|1:32:54|At this moment, Sudan's father opened the car door and sat back inside.
1:33:21|1:33:39|[Sudan], who was well-prepared, first put on a pair of earrings the size of palms, then took out a CD from the storage box in the front passenger seat and inserted it into the car's CD player. In an instant, the familiar and story-filled song lingered in the ears of the two, and then they smiled at each other.
1:33:39|1:34:0|Dad Ogawa started the taxi after watching [Sudan] take a deep breath, and perhaps it was when he accidentally touched the car's CD player while destroying the brake line that the originally warm and romantic song suddenly filled with static, as if also hinting at the mysterious reason behind Dad Ogawa's disappearance.
1:34:0|1:34:6|After experiencing one car jump experiment after another, [Sudan] and [Fan Li] have finally embarked on the journey.
1:34:7|1:34:22|After driving into the dock from the depths of the road, [Sudan] stepped on the gas pedal and headed straight towards the river. The turbulent river quickly swallowed the taxi, but the two were nowhere to be seen. Time rewound to the present.
1:34:28|1:34:34|[Sudan] followed Xiaochuan with a limp and a punch.
1:35:2|1:35:14|The original small stream walking in front of [Sudan] heard his confession about the car chase incident that year, but smiled, stopped, turned around to look at him, calmly expressing his own opinion. In response, [Sudan] just smiled.
1:35:18|1:35:33|Xiao Chuan heard this, his lips moved slightly, but he remained silent. Then he saw [Sudan] dragging his lame leg past him. Xiao Chuan restrained himself from wanting to catch up, and watched him slowly leave the alley with his peripheral vision.
1:35:33|1:35:41|Unwilling to accept it, as [Sudan] was about to disappear around the bend, Xiao Chuan suddenly turned around and stared straight at his back.
1:35:42|1:35:52|No one would have expected that the woman who used to love wearing tight skirts and leather boots is now selling breakfast in this quiet village, wearing a short-sleeved shirt and skirt that have long lost their luster.
1:35:55|1:36:12|Ignoring the clumsy person's gaze behind him, [Sudan] once again recalled the day of the accident. Accompanied by singing, the taxi plunged into the river without hesitation. In the moment it left the road surface, the car flipped over heavily and fell down, with the roof directly hitting the surface of the river.
1:36:12|1:36:21|The surging river water quickly poured into the front seat of the taxi through the open window, causing the car's CD player to instantly go silent, abruptly stopping the music.
1:36:22|1:36:34|Before long, the entire body of the car was completely perpendicular to the river, gradually being submerged in the darkness of the night. In the dark night, the taxi's tail lights struggled against the river, resembling a signal of a dying person calling for help.
1:36:34|1:36:49|Unfortunately, after flashing a few times, the vehicles on the river disappeared quickly. It seemed like no one noticed someone crawling out of the front seat of the taxi. All that could be heard was the taxi gradually sinking to the bottom, making a gurgling sound.
1:36:49|1:37:5|In less than a moment, the commotion of the flooding had completely dissipated, and the river surface returned to calmness once again, as if all of this was the most normal state of affairs now. By the dock rested small boats, while in the distance, the city that had not yet woken up could be seen.
1:37:5|1:37:17|Sparse lights scattered on the river surface, boats returning home either early in the morning or late at night, heading towards the direction of home. It all seemed ordinary and mundane to an average person.
1:37:18|1:37:41|For the two in the taxi, the impact on their future days could be significant. In that old house, [Sudan] is sitting at the dining table, bending over to play with toys with his sister. [Sudan]'s mother brings dishes of food to the table from the kitchen.
1:37:46|1:38:8|Next, [Sudan]'s mother turned around and took out a bottle of wine from the cupboard. Upon hearing this, Wu Tao stopped teasing his sister, turned around, picked up his chopsticks and started eating. After just one bite, he stopped. Wu Tao's mother poured a glass of wine and asked Wu Tao a question.
1:38:10|1:38:21|Xiao Chuan glanced down at his leg and saw his little sister playing with toys in the car. Without looking back, he answered. Xiao Chuan's mother had to pick up a chopstick of food from the plate and put it in the bowl before speaking.
1:38:27|1:38:33|Xiao Chuan did not respond, but after taking two bites of rice, he couldn't help but speak up.
1:38:38|1:38:55|Wu Tao's mother stopped picking vegetables, unconsciously chewed twice, picked up the wine glass next to her and swallowed it in one gulp, then picked up the chopsticks again to eat while looking at her young daughter. The three of them thus began an ordinary day.
