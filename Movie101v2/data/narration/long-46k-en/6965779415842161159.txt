0:3:40|0:4:1|[Xiaorong] took off her earpiece to take a break, and [Chen Mo] also turned to take off his earpiece, looking at [Xiaorong], accidentally pushing the volume up. [Xiaorong] thought for a moment, turned around to look up at [Chen Mo], and slowly said, [Chen Mo] sat blankly in the chair looking at her, [Xiaorong] turned her head to avoid his gaze, and let out a long sigh.
0:4:12|0:4:18|Chen Mo quickly turned off the conversation as his colleague vigorously knocked on the glass, anxiously gesturing that their conversation was being broadcast. Then, with a sense of reluctance and defiance, he uttered a sentence.
0:4:21|0:4:42|After taking off the headphones from his neck and slamming them heavily on the table, [Chen Mo] turned around and walked away. The camera gradually pulled back with his footsteps, revealing the recording studio on the rooftop and the colorful night view of Chongqing. Subsequently, the names of the original author Zhang Jiajia, director Zhang Yibai, and the title of the film "You Are the One" appeared on the screen.
0:4:42|0:5:8|As the music comes to an end, the story of the film also reaches a day two years later. [Chen Mo] is wearing headphones in the recording studio, leaning back lazily in his chair, yawning.
0:5:26|0:5:42|[Chen Mo] turned off the advertisement, immediately switched to music, and started to groove along with the rhythm, unable to resist the urge to move his body. After a while, he began scratching his head, yawning, and boredly playing with his phone. The noisy music irritated many of the audience members.
0:5:42|0:5:57|The person doing styling in the barber shop, the head chef in the restaurant kitchen, the employee in the white-collar studio, the passenger in the taxi, and even the ex-[Xiaorong] have all turned off the radio.
0:6:52|0:7:22|[Lizhi] appears, the rice cooker explodes, [Mao Shibei] runs away. [Mao Shibei] is tinkering with a remote-controlled airplane, while [Lizhi] watches on. The remote-controlled airplane explodes in the air, [Lizhi] teases, and [Mao Shibei] turns around to run away again. [Lizhi] chases after him, the scene cuts to the rooftop where [Zhutou] is using the foam from the pot to scrub clothes.
0:8:1|0:8:17|[Chen Mo's Mom] took out chopsticks thoughtfully, and [Chen Mo] took the opportunity to tap [Zhutou]'s head with the chopsticks. In the office, a group of interns were discussing the trophies that [Xiaorong] had won, completely unaware of [Chen Mo] standing behind them.
0:9:9|0:9:44|The two of them spoke in unison, the interns hesitated and made excuses to leave. At this moment, a girl's voice was heard in the crowd. Upon hearing this, [Yaoji] withdrew his smile, looked awkwardly at [Chen Mo]. On the streets of Chongqing, street vendors skillfully made street snacks. [Chen Mo], [Zhutou], and [Mao Shibei] squatted on the side of the street eating noodles on stools. [Lizhi], dressed in a police uniform, walked towards the three of them. [Mao Shibei] looked up, saw [Lizhi], dropped his chopsticks, and ran away.
0:9:46|0:10:6|Lizhi followed closely behind, Chen Mo and Zhutou also dropped their chopsticks. The four of them chased each other, and the noodle seller ran out shouting. Along the bustling street, they ran for who knows how long. Mao Shibei's stamina decreased, Lizhi grabbed Mao Shibei and pressed him against the wall.
0:10:36|0:10:51|Lizhi next to him was secretly taking photos of Mao Shibei with her phone, smiling as she did so. Mao Shibei and Zhutou were silently removing the small ads on the wall, Chen Mo walked up to Lizhi and saw her taking photos secretly. Lizhi quickly put away her phone when she noticed.
0:11:0|0:11:22|[Mao Shibei] and [Chen Mo] passed by each other, walked up to [Lizhi], [Mao Shibei] ignored him, then tore down a small advertisement. [Mao Shibei] looked towards [Zhutou], while [Lizhi] chuckled quietly.
0:12:57|0:13:25|[Chen Mo] looked at [Yaoji] in surprise. After [Yaoji] finished speaking, she realized [Chen Mo] was staring at her in shock. She quickly bowed and apologized. The headset on her head fell to the ground due to the bowing motion. [Yaoji] hurriedly picked up the headset and put it back on, but in her fluster, she didn't notice that she put it on backwards. She lowered her head, covering her face in embarrassment. [Chen Mo] bit off a piece of noodle, struggled to swallow the unfinished noodle in his mouth, and continued the live broadcast.
0:13:30|0:13:35|On the rooftop outside the recording studio, [Yaoji] nervously holds a bowl of noodles facing [Chen Mo], while [Chen Mo] points his finger at [Yaoji]'s forehead.
0:14:15|0:14:22|A group of pigeons flew away in response, [Yaoji] placed the noodles on the ground and walked away, while radio stations in various cities were broadcasting.
0:14:49|0:14:52|The camera cuts back to the office, with [Xiaorong] walking towards everyone with a file in hand.
0:14:57|0:15:8|[Xiaorong] lowered her head and saw [Chen Mo] sleeping on the ground. Without saying a word, she kicked him in the butt. [Chen Mo] grunted and woke up. When he saw it was [Xiaorong], he immediately got up, but his eyes were still sleepy, showing signs of exhaustion.
0:15:10|0:15:18|The crowd let out a gasp, [Chen Mo] rubbed his eyes, unable to believe it, looking in a daze in the direction [Xiaorong] had left.
0:15:34|0:15:45|[Chen Mo] was looking at the viewership data from the last live broadcast when suddenly someone tapped on his shoulder. Startled, [Chen Mo] turned around to see a person wearing a gorilla mask, and he screamed in fear. He swung his fist and knocked the person down to the ground. On the rooftop outside the recording studio, [Chen Mo] was taking a selfie while wearing the gorilla mask.
0:15:48|0:15:58|Picking up a bottle of ice water and handing it to the person next to him, the person originally dressed as [Yaoji] is [Yaoji], who takes the ice water while [Chen Mo] continues to take selfies.
0:16:42|0:17:6|[Chen Mo] got up and walked towards the door, taking out a key from his pocket and throwing it to [Yaoji]. [Yaoji] caught the key and smiled happily, then unexpectedly did a somersault on the rooftop. [Chen Mo] took off his gorilla mask and looked thoughtfully at [Yaoji] in front of him. [Yaoji] accidentally fell to the ground, but when she saw [Chen Mo] looking at her, she ran her fingers through her messy hair and grinned foolishly at him.
0:17:9|0:17:14|In the dormitory, [Zhutou] is holding a phone and watching videos.
0:17:19|0:17:32|[Zhutou] pulled the collar of his shirt to show [Yanzi] the tattoo on his chest more clearly.
0:17:40|0:17:45|[Zhutou] hurriedly opened the box in front of him and took out a beautiful dress from inside.
0:18:16|0:18:27|The next day, during the day, [Zhutou] was buried in writing something on the table. When he saw [Chen Mo] coming out of the bedroom, [Zhutou] quickly stuffed the paper into his pocket. [Mao Shibei] and [Zhutou] didn't say a word.
0:19:48|0:19:54|[Mao Shibei] took out a card and gave it to [Zhutou], but [Chen Mo] snatched it away.
0:20:1|0:20:30|[Zhutou] took the receipt from [Chen Mo] and spread out his hands, pointing at [Mao Shibei] and [Zhutou] in front of him. He took out a bank card from his wallet and handed it to [Zhutou]. Although [Zhutou] said he didn't want it while looking at the card in [Chen Mo]'s hand, he still reached out to take it. [Chen Mo] let go, turned around and walked out. When he reached the door, he remembered something, turned back and asked. After a brief eye contact, [Chen Mo] helplessly turned and left.
0:20:39|0:20:46|The response on the phone made [Xiaorong] stop her steps on the stairs. After a moment of contemplation, she continued walking upstairs towards the live broadcast room.
0:20:49|0:21:9|At this moment, [Yaoji] is in the live streaming room. When she looks up and sees [Xiaorong] outside the window, she immediately crouches down and hides under the table. However, she is still spotted by [Xiaorong]. [Xiaorong] pushes the door open and enters the room. [Yaoji], at this moment, grabs her bag and prepares to leave secretly. [Xiaorong] opens the door and exits the live streaming room, with [Yaoji] following closely behind.
0:21:26|0:21:32|Chen Mo, who was walking towards them, heard Xiaorong's words and pointed at her with his head held high.
0:22:40|0:22:46|The camera moves to the display case, where [Chen Mo] picks up his trophy.
0:22:50|0:23:2|After [Chen Mo] slammed the trophy on the ground, everyone gasped. [Yaoji] and [Chen Mo] quickly picked up the trophy from the ground.
0:23:57|0:24:4|[Xiaorong] typed out four words on her phone for [Chen Mo] to see. The words on the phone read "I am a fool." [Chen Mo] saw the four words through the phone screen.
0:24:36|0:24:59|The commotion stopped, the crowd dispersed, [Xiaorong] turned and walked away, leaving [Chen Mo] and [Yaoji] standing in place. [Chen Mo] made a few threatening gestures towards the direction [Xiaorong] left, then turned to look at [Yaoji] behind him. The two stared at each other for a while before finally turning and walking away, disappearing around the corner of the office.
0:25:2|0:25:27|In pouring rain, [Chen Mo] holding takeout in his hand, sees [Chen Mo's Mom] sitting on the distant steps, completely ignoring [Yaoji] who is chasing after him with an umbrella. He rushes into the heavy rain, running towards [Chen Mo's Mom] in the distance, with soaked clothes clinging tightly to his body.
0:25:50|0:26:2|[Chen Mo] watched as [Chen Mo's Mom] absentmindedly made a phone call, then sat beside her, using his sleeve to wipe the rain-soaked hair. He took out his phone from his jacket pocket to answer the call from [Chen Mo's Mom].
0:26:12|0:26:23|[Chen Mo's Mom] turned to see [Chen Mo] beside her, put down her phone, and carefully examined the person in front of her. [Chen Mo] widened his eyes and leaned closer to [Chen Mo's Mom], trying to make her see more clearly.
0:26:25|0:26:32|Chen Mo's Mom carefully scrutinized Chen Mo once again.
0:26:46|0:27:15|[Chen Mo] opened the takeout in his hand and handed it to [Chen Mo's Mom], guarding by her side. He watched as [Chen Mo's Mom] ate heartily, reaching out to tidy up the stray hair by her ear. [Chen Mo's Mom] smiled slightly at him. The camera pulled back, and not far away, [Yaoji] stood under an umbrella, watching the scene unfold. The city's night was brightly lit, with radio stations in various cities playing programs for the evening, and [Chen Mo] and [Yaoji] were no exception.
0:28:44|0:28:56|Xiaorong in the car saw Chen Mo checking himself in the rearview mirror on the radio, Cao stopped the car on the side of the road, Xiaorong got off and left. Meanwhile, after the broadcast, Chen Mo and Yaoji arrived at the subway station to take the subway home.
0:29:56|0:30:17|After watching for a few seconds, [Yaoji] walked forward, caught up with him, and the two of them sat on the subway where the crowd was sparse. [Chen Mo] sat in his seat, looking up and down at [Yaoji], who was leaning alone against the subway handrail with his back to him, then took out his phone and put it to his ear.
0:30:41|0:30:47|[Yaoji] pretends to make a phone call with his cellphone.
0:31:30|0:31:50|The train sped forward, passing one station after another, the scenery outside the window constantly receding. Inside the carriage, [Chen Mo] and [Yaoji] continued to interact.
0:31:54|0:32:4|[Yaoji] happily runs in the subway, while outside the subway in Chongqing, the lights are bright.
0:32:8|0:32:37|[Lizhi] chased after [Mao Shibei] on the street, and [Mao Shibei] stumbled into a dead end. Blocked by a fence, the two of them stood panting, facing each other. [Mao Shibei] gave [Lizhi] a dissatisfied look.
0:33:25|0:33:40|[Mao Shibei] questioned [Lizhi], who closed the notebook and looked at [Mao Shibei] with a serious expression.
0:33:53|0:34:10|[Lizhi] recalled a past romance, her emotions lingering for a long time. After speaking, [Lizhi] turned and walked away. After a few steps, it seemed like she forgot something, then she turned to look at [Mao Shibei]. Seeing her turn, [Mao Shibei] instinctively took a step back.
0:34:25|0:34:29|After listening to Mao Shibei's words, Lizhi smiled and walked towards him.
0:34:53|0:35:5|Upon hearing Mao Shibei's response, Lizhi's gaze shifted away from his face. She shyly turned around and staggered up the steps, swaying as if she had been drinking. Mao Shibei stood in place, watching Lizhi's figure as she walked away.
0:35:13|0:35:27|It started raining in Chongqing. [Xiaorong] got out of the car wearing a windbreaker and holding an umbrella. [Chen Mo] looked down at [Xiaorong] from the window upstairs, while [Yaoji] stood on the opposite building, gazing at [Chen Mo] through the rain-streaked glass, with a sense of loneliness in his eyes.
0:35:27|0:35:36|[Zhutou] and the group were eating hotpot, [Chen Mo] holding a wine glass, while [Zhutou] stood by the river holding a property certificate and shouting towards the distance.
0:36:28|0:36:33|Seeing [Yanzi] passing by, [Zhutou] chased after her. In the night, [Zhutou] ran round and round on the playground.
0:36:53|0:37:0|Seeing [Zhutou] and [Yanzi] coming to the classroom with books for self-study, the classmates avoided them, but [Zhutou] remained unfazed.
0:38:3|0:38:7|Chen Mo was moved and bent down to hug Zhutou's head.
0:38:15|0:38:24|Chen Mo held Zhutou's face earnestly, looked at him admiringly, breathed a sigh of relief, and sat back in his seat.
0:39:5|0:39:12|After buying breakfast, [Lizhi] returned to [Mao Shibei]'s house after warmly greeting the neighbors.
0:39:25|0:39:38|While tidying up the room, [Chen Mo's Mom] woke up the sleeping [Mao Shibei], put the dirty clothes left on the chair into the washing machine, and heard [Mao Shibei]'s voice coming from inside the refrigerator.
0:39:55|0:40:4|[Lizhi] placed the pancake near Mao Shibei's mouth. Mao Shibei, lying on the bed, still lingered in bed, unwilling to get up, smelling the aroma of the pancake.
0:40:31|0:40:34|[Mao Shibei] leaned forward, gazing affectionately at the shy figure in front of him.
0:40:51|0:41:1|Mao Shibei bent down to take the child's laptop from the crack of the door. By the time he turned around, Lizhi had already put on the police uniform. Love filled Mao Shibei's eyes.
0:41:15|0:41:23|[Lizhi] left with a police cap in one hand and a small gadget invented by Mao Shibei in the other hand. As night fell, the nighttime broadcasts in various cities began again.
0:41:34|0:41:41|[Yaoji] sat in the recording studio chair wrapped in a blanket, unable to stop coughing and sniffling. [Chen Mo] massaged his head while talking.
0:41:54|0:41:59|Hastily picking up the medicine next to him, [Yaoji] handed it to [Chen Mo], who drank it silently, followed by [Chen Mo] taking a sip as well.
0:43:8|0:43:14|Chen Mo on the side saw Yaoji's condition deteriorating.
0:45:58|0:46:18|The nurse in the hospital reminded [Chen Mo] to control the volume. [Chen Mo] kept apologizing as he bent over. After hanging up the phone, [Chen Mo] walked over to [Yaoji], who was lying on the hospital bed receiving an IV drip. [Chen Mo] was about to cover her with a blanket, but [Yaoji] turned over and hugged his arm. [Chen Mo] looked around, carefully pulled over a nearby chair, sat down, and let out a long sigh.
0:46:18|0:46:24|Quietly watching [Yaoji],
0:46:44|0:46:54|Outside the police station courtyard on the other side, [Mao Shibei] is tinkering with the machine in his hand, when [Lizhi] sneaks up from behind and gives him a tap on the head.
0:49:4|0:49:8|After the parade, they returned to the office. [Yaoji] was sitting at the desk when [Chen Mo] came in and looked at [Yaoji].
0:49:11|0:49:18|[Yaoji] returned a fake smile to him, they arrived at the airport, [Yanzi] returned from overseas. [Chen Mo] took the luggage.
0:49:50|0:49:56|[Zhutou]'s speech drew cheers from the audience, at this moment [Chen Mo] walked in with [Yanzi].
0:50:3|0:50:17|[Yanzi] walked in, the audience applauded and cheered, friends and family below encouraged [Zhutou] to do well. [Zhutou] and [Yanzi] exchanged smiles. Seeing his lover return, [Zhutou] nervously lowered his head and held the microphone.
0:51:25|0:51:34|[Yanzi] finally opened the door, tears in her eyes, pushing [Zhutou] away, telling him not to come near her. [Zhutou] turned around and said to the people behind him,
0:51:57|0:52:6|Zhutou's expression instantly froze, realizing that this was no joke. Yanzi sobbed.
0:52:31|0:52:38|[Chen Mo] and his group detached themselves from the emotions they had just experienced upon hearing what [Yanzi] said. [Yanzi] took [Zhutou] by the hand and walked back to the ceremony site.
0:52:40|0:52:48|[Zhutou] reluctantly forced a strained smile at his friends, then walked away with a dejected expression and head hung low. [Chen Mo] and the others followed behind them.
0:53:17|0:53:26|Back at the ceremony, [Zhutou] pretended to cheer happily to the crowd.
0:55:2|0:55:11|Three people lying on the ground were speechless. [Mao Shibei] helped [Zhutou] up, while [Chen Mo] remained sitting on the ground.
0:55:18|0:55:36|[Xiaorong] finished speaking and sat down, [Zhutou] left, [Yaoji] tried to hold him back, but [Zhutou] completely ignored her and left without looking back. On the streets of Chongqing, [Zhutou] was preparing to send [Yanzi] away.
0:55:59|0:56:7|[Yanzi] gets into a taxi, ready to leave.
0:57:0|0:57:5|The taxi sped away, with [Zhutou] kneeling on the ground, wailing loudly.
0:57:32|0:57:46|The thief was tripped by a fruit basket in front, and [Lizhi] immediately seized the opportunity to catch the thief. The thief was burly, and [Lizhi] took a solid punch from him. Ignoring the pain on her face, she grabbed the thief again. Learning from past mistakes, [Lizhi] cleverly avoided the thief's fist this time.
0:57:55|0:58:7|Suddenly, three accomplices of the thief ran up. [Lizhi] grabbed the thief's collar and gave it a hard shake, then kicked him in the stomach.
0:58:13|0:58:34|[Lizhi] fought with four thugs, grabbed one thug and threw him towards a fruit basket on the side. Another thug grabbed her waist trying to control her, but [Lizhi] shook her body and the thug ended up pushing her towards a vegetable stall on the roadside. [Lizhi] then picked up a bunch of celery and hit the thug with it. Seeing the situation turning against him, one thug pulled out a knife and stabbed towards [Lizhi]'s abdomen, only to hit the alarm device on her abdomen.
0:58:40|0:58:46|Mao Shibei at home received the alarm message and rushed out without hesitation, while Lizhi pinned one of them down on the car next to her.
0:58:58|0:59:17|Seeing the thug struggling, [Lizhi] pulled him off balance and they both fell to the ground. [Lizhi] removed the broken alarm device and placed it on the ground. Hearing the urgent shouts of [Mao Shibei], the onlookers turned their attention. [Lizhi] quickly responded.
0:59:22|0:59:27|The two gasped for breath and smiled at each other.
0:59:32|0:59:38|[Lizhi] stuttered to finish her words, still lying on the ground suppressing the villain, continuing to exchange glances with [Mao Shibei].
0:59:42|0:59:47|[Chen Mo] and [Mao Shibei] were leaning on the balcony railing, chatting.
1:0:2|1:0:7|The two arrived at [Chen Mo]'s home, where [Chen Mo] took out a dusty notebook from an old box.
1:0:44|1:1:18|At this moment, the tow truck driver wanted to tow away [Xiaorong]'s car. [Chen Mo] turned up the music in his car and drove towards [Xiaorong]'s car, causing the airbags to deploy. [Chen Mo] was injured, with blood on his face and nose. He leaned against the deformed seat, gripping the steering wheel for a while before struggling to open the car door and stagger out. [Xiaorong] held back tears, covering her mouth in disbelief as she watched him. Ignoring her, [Chen Mo] walked away.
1:1:19|1:1:30|Throughout the scene, [Yaoji] stood still, puzzled by why [Chen Mo] was acting this way. As the evening radio show began, the song "Blue Lotus" by Xu Wei was playing.
1:1:34|1:1:46|[Chen Mo] sat blankly in the recording studio, tears in his eyes. As the song was about to reach its climax, [Chen Mo] suddenly sang along with it.
1:1:52|1:2:0|After this experience, [Chen Mo] decided to go to Daocheng to dispel his inner depression.
1:2:8|1:2:14|Accompanying Chen Mo are Lizhi, Mao Shibei, and others. The three are driving on the highway, with Mao Shibei's navigation already sounding.
1:3:16|1:3:24|[Xiaorong] heard this and slowly put down the coffee cup in her hand, deep in thought. On the other side, [Chen Mo] and [Mao Shibei] were discussing something.
1:3:42|1:3:46|Shocked, [Yaoji] decided to help [Mao Shibei] propose on a scorching hot day.
1:3:49|1:3:58|[Chen Mo] received a call from Xiao Li, who appeared wearing a straw hat and pulling a cart full of marriage proposal materials. Upon seeing this, [Chen Mo] and the others hurried forward to help unload the cart.
1:4:19|1:4:22|All set, [Mao Shibei] takes [Lizhi] to the proposal location,
1:4:33|1:4:56|After speaking, [Mao Shibei] took [Lizhi] and ran a little, the two of them laughed happily. They passed through layers of bushes, and [Mao Shibei] brought [Lizhi] to the proposal scene. On the vast lawn stood a temporary church built by [Mao Shibei] and others. Looking at the church that would fall down with a gust of wind, [Lizhi] was at a loss whether to cry or laugh. Tears of emotion had already filled her eyes.
1:5:15|1:5:21|[Mao Shibei] looked affectionately at [Lizhi], took out a ring from his pocket, and knelt down on one knee.
1:6:0|1:6:19|Lizhi nodded with a smile, Mao Shibei put the ring on Lizhi's hand. Chen Mo, hiding behind the church, tears in his eyes as he witnessed this scene. Yaoji quickly asked upon seeing it.
1:6:24|1:6:42|Embarrassed Chen Mo wiped away his tears when he was discovered, while Mao Shibei kissed Lizhi's hand. Chen Mo and Yaoji held balloons in their hands, quietly counting down before releasing the balloons. Mao Shibei and Lizhi embraced happily, while Chen Mo and Yaoji, excited to see Mao Shibei proposing, also hugged each other.
1:6:45|1:6:52|On a night in Daocheng, [Chen Mo] and [Mao Shibei] gathered to drink. In the past, I was an inventor without dreams.
1:7:55|1:8:12|The next day, [Chen Mo] and [Yaoji] were in a golden rice field holding a boom microphone to record. Various insects' calls could be heard sparsely in the field, and in the distance, the songs of local residents working could be heard.
1:8:14|1:8:20|[Yaoji] keenly sensed the sound coming from a distance and quickly pointed the microphone of the recording pole in the direction of the sound.
1:8:48|1:9:1|The two followed the singing to locate the local residents, with [Chen Mo] recording for them. [Yaoji] joined the local residents, and [Chen Mo] couldn't take his eyes off the joyful [Yaoji] in front of him for a long time.
1:9:6|1:9:18|Infected by the atmosphere of the villagers, [Chen Mo] also joined in. He linked arms with [Yaoji], humming the tunes of the local residents, and danced along with the music.
1:9:21|1:9:38|The night quietly arrived, changing the hustle and bustle of the day. The surroundings were so quiet, adding a touch of mystery to the night in Daocheng. Faintly, a few stars could be seen emitting dim light. [Chen Mo] and [Yaoji] lay on the grass watching the stars.
1:10:2|1:10:19|Chen Mo did not respond. Under the starry sky, Yaoji nestled beside Chen Mo. Suddenly, Yaoji's phone alarm went off, and Yaoji took out the phone.
1:10:24|1:10:32|[Chen Mo] drives with [Yaoji] to search for a wireless signal in preparation for broadcasting.
1:10:38|1:10:42|In the recording studio in Chongqing, [Xiaorong] has already started broadcasting live.
1:13:24|1:13:31|Chen Mo's phone suddenly rang,
1:13:38|1:13:44|Outside the recording studio, a colleague stood up and knocked on the glass, signaling for [Xiaorong] to answer the hotline call.
1:13:57|1:14:9|[Xiaorong] waited quietly for a response on the other end of the phone. She longed to hear a voice from the other end, but instead, there was only prolonged silence.
1:14:16|1:14:19|Xiaorong shed tears without saying a word.
1:14:23|1:14:34|From the innocence of youth to the sweetness of love, from the passion of hormones to the increasingly dull life, their refusal to compromise and admit defeat ultimately led the two to drift further and further apart.
1:14:39|1:14:48|After listening to the radio, [Yaoji] in the car had already cried red eyes, while [Chen Mo] still had a carefree smile on his face.
1:15:10|1:15:13|[Yaoji] finished speaking, unbuckled the seatbelt, opened the car door and got out.
1:15:57|1:16:4|[Yaoji] lost control of his emotions, tears filling his eyes.
1:16:21|1:16:40|Yaoji continued walking forward, not knowing how long she had been walking. It was already bright outside. Yaoji squatted by the side of the road, with Chen Mo's car parked behind her. Suddenly, she remembered something. She stood up and walked towards the car, knocking on the driver's side window.
1:16:50|1:16:53|[Chen Mo] looked at [Yaoji] without saying a word for a long time.
1:17:16|1:17:30|The broadcasts in various cities continued as usual, and [Mao Shibei]'s life carried on. He was tinkering with electrical appliances in his small electronics store, while his fiancée [Lizhi] stood at the door watching him.
1:18:7|1:18:38|In the recording studio on the rooftop, [Chen Mo] was flipping through a stack of documents when a USB drive fell out from one of the files. The USB drive had [Yaoji]'s interview written on it. After looking around the office and seeing no one, [Chen Mo] plugged the USB drive into the computer and put on headphones to watch the content. It was a video of [Yaoji]'s interview. Meanwhile, [Mao Shibei] was tinkering with equipment on the rooftop at home.
1:18:44|1:18:47|[Xiaorong] received a call from [Yaoji],
1:18:48|1:18:54|Xiaorong, can you come up to the rooftop? Meanwhile, in the office, Chen Mo also received a call from Yaoji.
1:19:1|1:19:5|Xiaorong is the first to arrive at the rooftop.
1:20:19|1:20:30|[Xiaorong] hugged [Chen Mo], while [Yaoji] watched from the side and then left for [Chen Mo]'s home.
1:20:35|1:20:50|[Yaoji] settles [Chen Mo's Mom] down, then leaves. On the rooftop, [Xiaorong] and [Chen Mo] lean against the railing and chat.
1:21:37|1:21:46|Chen Mo hesitated for a moment, then quietly took the card from Xiaorong's hand.
1:22:25|1:22:29|[Xiaorong] smiled as she thought about what [Chen Mo] had said, then watched him turn and walk away.
1:22:36|1:22:44|On the rooftop, only [Chen Mo] was left. He made a phone call but couldn't get through. The phone in his hand showed a message indicating that the number was switched off.
1:22:52|1:22:54|He was blankly staring into space on the rooftop,
1:23:10|1:23:16|The usual broadcast had a slight change, with [Chen Mo] live in the recording studio.
1:24:43|1:24:51|[Yaoji] drew a house, a tree, and a little girl on the wall.
1:25:4|1:25:17|The boy seeking shelter from the rain is drawing something on the wall, while [Yaoji] watches him from inside the convenience store through the window.
1:26:54|1:27:6|He was posting small ads in the alley, the ads were about the information of passing through your world.
1:27:43|1:27:54|Chen Mo finished telling the story about [Yaoji], he finished work and looked out the window.
1:28:5|1:28:18|In the mountain city of Chongqing, as the lights come on, the streets are filled with traffic and people. Despite the calls on the radio, [Chen Mo] sits helplessly in the recording studio.
1:28:20|1:28:48|[Yaoji] got on the bus leaving the city. After a while, a driver pressed the hazard lights button in the bus. Then the cars waiting for traffic lights on the road, the taxis stopping outside the mall, and the white-collar workers off duty all turned on their hazard lights. The vehicles within sight were all flashing. A colleague outside the recording studio gestured for [Chen Mo] to look out the window. At this moment, [Chen Mo] was already asleep on the table.
1:28:48|1:29:0|He got up with sleepy eyes, his face full of confusion. After walking out of the recording studio, he couldn't help but look back at his colleagues. After confirming again, he slowly walked to the edge of the rooftop and looked down.
1:29:7|1:29:27|The camera followed his gaze to the dark alley below the rooftop, where vehicles were parked one after another. The cars at the ends of the alley all had their hazard lights on, and the lights in the residential buildings next to the alley were also flickering. Cars were driving on the overpass in the distance, and each residential building emitted a dazzling light. The entire mountain city looked like a sea of stars.
1:29:27|1:29:50|On the rooftop, [Chen Mo] couldn't help but smile at the scene before him. The lights became the protagonist of this long night, with bustling traffic and taxi drivers all in action. Rows of car lights formed a brilliant and dazzling landscape, with almost all cars flashing their hazard lights.
1:29:54|1:30:7|[Chen Mo] walked to the other end of the rooftop, looking at the towering buildings in front of him, with neon lights flashing all over the city. He gazed into the distance, as if hoping to see [Yaoji] in the long line of cars, but [Yaoji] never appeared.
1:30:14|1:30:22|He entered the recording studio and started broadcasting live again.
1:30:47|1:31:2|On the bus, [Yaoji] burst into tears upon hearing the broadcast. After wiping away his tears, he sent a WeChat message to [Chen Mo]. In the recording studio, [Chen Mo] immediately opened his phone to check the message.
1:31:20|1:31:29|At the end of the day's work, [Lizhi] rode his motorcycle home. Suddenly, a car in the distance turned on its high beams, blinding [Lizhi] and forcing him to stop.
1:31:32|1:31:58|She watched as the person with a stick got out of the car, feeling anxious. She parked the motorcycle, stood up, and carefully identified the person getting out of the car. Suddenly, a few people appeared behind her, turns out they were the thieves from last time. [Lizhi] was caught in a dilemma, with no way to advance or retreat. Meanwhile, [Mao Shibei] received an alert from the alarm device in the electronics store and immediately locked onto the location to head towards where [Lizhi] was.
1:32:2|1:32:10|[Lizhi], who fought alone against the gang of thieves, was already covered in wounds. His fists were no match for the group, and he was captured by the thieves.
1:32:17|1:32:22|[Mao Shibei] arrived at the scene and threw a cardboard box at the thief.
1:33:1|1:33:18|After finishing speaking, [Lizhi] started fighting with them. Seeing [Lizhi] being caught, [Mao Shibei] wanted to fight back. Suddenly, someone stabbed [Mao Shibei] with a knife, leaving him stunned. [Mao Shibei] held his stomach wound, gritting his teeth to prevent himself from falling. [Lizhi] stepped back and stood back to back with [Mao Shibei], covering his nose which was injured by the thief.
1:33:21|1:33:28|The police car arrived, and the gang of thieves fled in panic.
1:33:32|1:33:40|[Lizhi] wanted to go over and help, but was held back by [Mao Shibei], whose hands were covered in blood.
1:33:46|1:33:49|[Lizhi] wanted to break free from [Mao Shibei]'s embrace, but he held her tightly.
1:33:52|1:33:59|[Mao Shibei] lost too much blood and collapsed into [Lizhi]'s arms. The hand holding [Lizhi] gradually loosened and weakly fell down.
1:34:2|1:34:24|[Lizhi] looked at [Mao Shibei] who was limp on her shoulder, only then did she realize that [Mao Shibei] was seriously injured. She exerted all her strength to hold [Mao Shibei] and prevent his whole body from falling down. In a panic, she could only hold [Mao Shibei] tightly, tears streaming down her face.
1:34:55|1:35:1|In Mao Shibei's shop, [Lizhi] couldn't stop sobbing while holding the navigation device he invented.
1:35:5|1:35:14|Chen Mo stood at the door of the shop, looking back at her without saying a word, when Mao Shibei's voice came from the navigation device.
1:35:43|1:35:50|It's always rainy in the summer in Chongqing, and it's raining again now. [Chen Mo] is standing under an umbrella in front of the wall where [Yaoji] used to paint.
1:36:26|1:36:38|Time passed slowly, and 350 days later, in the town of Xiangcheng, Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, a little boy was playing in the market street. [Chen Mo] approached him.
1:37:59|1:38:20|[Chen Mo] waited by the roadside in the town with a gorilla mask on, hoping that the person getting off the bus would be the one he had been thinking about. However, his hope was dashed as the bus departed. Disappointed, [Chen Mo] took off the gorilla mask and let a nearby child play with it.
1:41:0|1:41:6|[Chen Mo] turned around and left, returning home to see his mom sitting at the dining table, walking over to sit down.
1:42:7|1:42:15|The next day, [Chen Mo] drove to the place where Mao Shibei proposed to [Lizhi].
1:42:33|1:42:44|[Chen Mo] arrived at the destination and was about to get off the car, when the navigation system spoke again.
1:43:57|1:44:3|In the streets and alleys, the sound of "Lizhi, I love you" from the electrical appliances repaired by Mao Shibei echoed at the same time.
1:44:37|1:44:44|[Chen Mo] stood on the grass and looked at the distant sky, with a long skirt appearing behind him.
