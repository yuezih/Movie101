0:1:31|0:1:44|Zhang Nan's gaze was suddenly drawn to the performance, a beautiful woman in a long dress leisurely walking towards him. Zhang Nan couldn't take his eyes off her, only seeing the blurry figure of this woman in a long dress. At this moment, the girl beside him called out.
0:1:50|0:2:10|[Zhang Nan] did not hear the girl's call beside him. At this moment, a beautiful woman, dressed simply yet occasionally gorgeously, with a graceful and charming figure, stood by the pool. [Zhang Nan] was once again mesmerized. He was bumped into by the waiter next to the beautiful woman. The woman caught [Zhang Nan] and he asked.
0:2:15|0:2:22|[Zhang Nan] had just finished speaking when the beauty let go of his hand and waved at him, her eyes smiling in all directions without showing any emotion.
0:2:27|0:2:32|After falling into the pool, Zhang Nan opened his eyes again only to find that the beauty was nowhere to be seen. On the shore, a group of people were laughing at themselves.
0:2:39|0:2:54|[Zhang Nan] frantically searched for the beautiful woman he had just seen, but did not see her figure. A group of people on the shore watched [Zhang Nan]'s embarrassment, and [Zhang Nan], feeling helpless, buried his head in the water, exhaling bubbles as if scattered clouds in the clear sky.
0:2:55|0:3:9|The title of this film, "Breakup at Dawn," is written in bright letters in the sky. The next morning, a sports car races through the city center and arrives at a commercial office building in the clear sky, parking on the side of the road.
0:3:9|0:3:16|The man in the car confidently gets out, closes the door, walks into the building, and is greeted respectfully by the employees.
0:3:30|0:3:42|The dashing man in this scene is [Zhang Nan]. Hearing the employees laughing behind his back, [Zhang Nan] turns around, his eyes intimidating the two. Once inside the office, the employees greet [Zhang Nan].
0:3:50|0:3:58|[Zhang Nan] sat leisurely in the chair, took the documents from the employee's plea, flipped through them expressionlessly, then signed his name on the documents and handed them back to the employee.
0:4:1|0:4:20|After the employee thanked and left with the documents, [Zhang Nan] watched the employee's receding figure. His serious expression relaxed, his hand casually resting on the table, fingers tapping lightly. He spun his chair around, looked around, picked up the Rubik's Cube from the shelf behind him, and passed the time by twisting the cube.
0:4:20|0:4:30|The dazzling music, accompanied by the Rubik's Cube spinning in Zhang Nan's hands, takes us to the bar, where the air is filled with the smell of smoke and alcohol. The music reaches its peak, almost deafening.
0:5:5|0:5:22|[Zhang Nan] walked through the bustling crowd and arrived at the center of the dance floor. The most eye-catching beauty on the stage sensually swayed her hips, her agile gestures following the rhythm of the music. In the dim light, the enchanting gaze of the beautiful woman was like a fleeting and elusive phantom.
0:5:22|0:5:34|[Zhang Nan] stared at the beautiful woman dancing in front of him, enough to make her forget her troubles. The lights, though dazzling, were not as noisy, and the music, though lively, was as refreshing as a waterfall.
0:5:36|0:5:53|[Zhang Nan] took a closer look and realized that the enchanting beauty dancing on stage and the noble goddess by the pool earlier were actually the same person. With a mischievous look in his eyes, [Zhang Nan] vindictively recorded the footage of the beauty dancing.
0:5:53|0:6:0|The beauty was completely unaware, as the music grew louder, she enjoyed the excitement and joy that the dance brought to her.
0:6:11|0:6:21|The music ends, and the beautiful woman and her two male partners turn their backs, ending with a perfect dance pose. [Zhang Nan] weaves through the cheering crowd, heading towards the center of the dance floor to find the woman.
0:6:46|0:6:59|She followed [Zhang Nan] to the dance floor, confidently picked up a glass of wine and drank it all in one go. [Zhang Nan] also didn't want to be outdone, the two of them continued to drink one glass after another, and the glasses gradually emptied. At this moment, [Zhang Nan] felt a bit overwhelmed by the alcohol and dizzy, leaning to one side.
0:6:59|0:7:9|The beauty, however, was not affected at all. After finishing a glass in one gulp, [Zhang Nan] was stunned, unable to close his mouth, exclaiming repeatedly. The onlookers couldn't help but cheer as they watched the beauty confront [Zhang Nan].
0:7:34|0:7:38|The beautiful woman stood up and took a few steps, then turned around and domineeringly said to [Zhang Nan],
0:7:40|0:7:54|In an instant, [Zhang Nan] stood still, looked up at the beautiful woman's smile, and also revealed a wicked smile. Under the flying and swaying city neon lights, [Zhang Nan] drove a sports car at high speed. [Zhang Nan] carried the drunken beauty to his own home.
0:7:54|0:8:12|He struggled to carry the beauty into the room, but as soon as he pushed open the door, they both fell heavily onto the bed. In close proximity, only heavy and warm breaths remained. The beauty passed out in [Zhang Nan]'s arms, unconscious. Looking at the sexy and charming beauty in front of him, a smirk appeared at the corner of [Zhang Nan]'s mouth, as he started to have some wicked thoughts.
0:8:12|0:8:21|She flipped over and knelt on top of the beauty, swiftly unbuttoned the coat, took it off and threw it on the bed, then deftly undid the belt, unzipped, all in one go.
0:8:22|0:8:38|At this moment, the beauty suddenly sat up, grabbed [Zhang Nan]'s pants, and in a confused state, buried her head in them. Unable to bear it, she directly vomited uncontrollably. [Zhang Nan] could only endure the disgust and dared not move. The beauty vomited all over [Zhang Nan]'s pants, then lay back down and continued sleeping.
0:8:38|0:8:51|[Zhang Nan] was stunned, she looked at the beauty in despair, got up and threw the clothes into the washing machine for cleaning. After returning to the room, she changed the beauty into a clean shirt, and then sat on the edge of the bed, helplessly raising her hand to embroider.
0:8:51|0:9:9|The next morning, [Le Er] was still lying in bed peacefully asleep, as if nothing had happened last night. The short skirt she wore while dancing last night was neatly spread on the bed, and she stretched lazily, grabbing the pillow. The headache from the hangover caused her to furrow her brows because she had drunk too much last night.
0:9:9|0:9:21|[Le Er] gradually regained consciousness. She suddenly sat up and realized that she was in a strange environment, and her clothes had been changed to a shirt. Looking at the messy bed, she couldn't help but scream loudly.
0:9:24|0:9:28|[Zhang Nan] brushes his teeth and peeks out from the bathroom.
0:9:43|0:9:59|After arguing and fighting with [Zhang Nan], [Le Er] gets up, enjoys soaking in the bathtub, and looks lazily at the sunshine outside the French window. With a relaxed expression, she is about to wash her hair with shampoo. Then, she casually picks up a bottle of hair care product on the bathtub and, holding up a mirror, [Le Er] keeps shouting.
0:10:4|0:10:12|[Zhang Nan] rushed to the kitchen after washing up, preparing breakfast for the two in a hurry. [Le Er] had already changed into elegant clothes and walked out in high heels.
0:10:16|0:10:22|The beauty approached [Zhang Nan], grabbed her clothes, leaned in close to [Zhang Nan]'s ear, and whispered softly.
0:11:23|0:11:28|[Zhang Nan] walked towards the podium, pointing at the photo on his phone, while the employees below were discussing animatedly.
0:11:46|0:12:2|The employees brought [Zhang Nan] to the stage, accompanied by elegant piano music. They saw a beautiful woman in ballet attire dancing gracefully under the spotlight. The music gradually intensified as she danced on her toes, her skirt swaying lightly with each step, resembling a flower about to bloom.
0:12:2|0:12:15|[Zhang Nan] was full of joy, wanting to call out to the beautiful woman, but was stopped by [Zhang Nan]. The beautiful woman danced freely on the stage, and as [Zhang Nan] watched her graceful and charming dance, he couldn't contain his excitement and walked up to her.
0:12:15|0:12:27|The beauty was entranced by the music, spinning with the beat, unaware of [Zhang Nan] approaching from the side and accidentally bumping into him, taking a step back and falling to the ground. The crowd hurriedly gathered around.
0:12:29|0:12:52|Zhang Nan tried to help the beauty up, but she pushed him away. Zhang Nan then picked up the beauty and drove to the hospital.
0:13:1|0:13:13|The two arrived at the billiard hall, where the beautiful woman broke the rack and one ball went into the pocket. [Zhang Nan] took a shot, but missed the ball, so he awkwardly chalked his cue. The woman leaned in close to [Zhang Nan] and whispered.
0:13:14|0:13:18|The beauty's hand brushed across [Zhang Nan]'s chest, causing him to feel numb.
0:13:23|0:13:38|The beauty keeps changing the position and posture of hitting the ball, each time hitting the flower ball accurately, and the ball goes into the hole. [Zhang Nan] couldn't take his eyes off, when the beauty bent over to aim at the cue ball, he walked to her side, held her, wrapped his hands around her body, and leaned in to whisper in her ear.
0:13:57|0:14:1|The beauty pouted, and [Zhang Nan] stood up to kiss her on the left, but was stopped by a hand.
0:14:17|0:14:29|Shortly after, [Zhang Nan] left first. The beauty watched [Zhang Nan] walk away, swaying her long green hair, revealing a complex and playful smile. Then, the beauty looked towards the distant bar counter, where a waiter was wiping glasses.
0:14:29|0:14:45|After exchanging glances, the beautiful woman turned and left, while the waiter's cold expression was hidden beneath his eyes as he continued to wipe the tableware. In her place, the beautiful woman was frolicking with [Zhang Nan] by the seaside. [Zhang Nan] carried a box of cola and sat down next to the beautiful woman, who exclaimed in surprise.
0:15:0|0:15:13|[Zhang Nan] chugged a bottle of cola, enjoying it and sneakily glancing at the beautiful woman. She drank the cola one after another with determination, without any hesitation. The beautiful woman was a bit shocked, marveling at [Zhang Nan]'s persistence.
0:15:16|0:15:37|The beauty was amused by [Zhang Nan]'s wit. After finishing the last bottle of cola, [Zhang Nan] tilted his head back proudly. The beauty impressed, gave a thumbs up. [Zhang Nan] suppressed the gas in his body, picked up a bottle of cola and handed it to the beauty.
0:15:40|0:15:48|The beauty puts down the cola, and both of them are amused. The beauty sweetly smiles, and [Zhang Nan] looks at the delightful beauty in front of him, saying.
0:15:56|0:16:9|The beauty dodged [Zhang Nan] and ran towards the seaside. [Zhang Nan] got up and chased after her. The two frolicked and laughed on the beach, and soon it was night. They went to the beauty's home to watch a movie, with an erotic scene playing on the TV.
0:16:9|0:16:24|In the film, a couple is bathing together. Watching this, [Zhang Nan] can't contain the excitement in her heart, and the scene gradually becomes bold and stimulating. [Zhang Nan] is lost in thought, constantly crossing her legs and twisting her posture. She picks up a small doll from the side to cover her legs, looking at the beauty.
0:16:24|0:16:42|The beauty was staring at the TV intently, so [Zhang Nan] boldly approached her quietly, opening his right arm and moving closer to her side. [Zhang Nan] pretended to yawn widely, taking the opportunity to reach out his right hand to embrace the beauty, but at that moment, the beauty turned to look at him and said sternly.
0:17:4|0:17:10|The beauty waved goodbye, [Zhang Nan] picked up a doll and walked towards the door, both making a gesture of talking on the phone.
0:17:15|0:17:28|[Zhang Nan] then noticed that he awkwardly threw the little lamb plush onto the sofa, and helplessly waved his hand before leaving. The beauty, seeing [Zhang Nan] walking away, was amused by his cute gesture. The next day, [Zhang Nan] was joking around with another girl in the hotel dressing room.
0:18:2|0:18:8|[Zhang Nan] looked apologetically at the girl in front of him, took the phone, stood up and walked to the side, speaking softly.
0:18:20|0:18:33|[Zhang Nan] smugly drove his sports car to the agreed location. After parking the car, [Zhang Nan] took out a few condoms hidden in the car compartment, and then carefully put them into his jacket pocket, humming a tune contentedly.
0:18:33|0:18:43|Later, [Zhang Nan] took out a condom from his pocket, sniffed it, then took out a business card holder, casually put the condom into the holder, and got off the car with a big mobile phone in hand.
0:18:46|0:18:53|[Zhang Nan] walked to the gate with brisk steps, knocked on the door like a gentleman, then called [Le Er] on the phone, with one hand in his pocket waiting for her arrival.
0:19:5|0:19:7|Upon hearing the sound of the door, [Zhang Nan] turned around in astonishment.
0:19:44|0:19:54|[Zhang Nan] took the porridge from [Le Er]'s hand and placed it on the table. The elderly people gathered around the table one after another, getting ready to sit down. [Le Er] walked over to greet everyone, then helped [Zhang Wen] to sit down and introduced him to everyone.
0:19:55|0:19:59|[Zhang Nan] enthusiastically opens the business card holder.
0:20:19|0:20:23|When Grandma handed out business cards, [Li] pulled out a condom.
0:20:32|0:20:38|The old man picked up the condom and examined it carefully, [Zhang Nan] felt embarrassed and tried to take it, the old people laughed and looked at [Zhang Nan].
0:20:51|0:20:55|[Le Er] stood awkwardly, then stared at [Zhang Nan] without saying a word.
0:21:16|0:21:31|At night, the lights added a mysterious atmosphere to the city. Late at night, [Le Er] dragged her tired body back home. She took off her high heels, put on comfortable slippers, as if she had unloaded the exhaustion of the day, without noticing the man standing behind the screen.
0:21:31|0:21:35|The man is none other than the man who locked eyes with [Le Er] in the board game hall earlier.
0:21:35|0:21:56|The man quietly approached and suddenly hugged [Le Er] from behind. [Le Er] was startled at first, but then realized it was someone familiar. She smiled with joy, gently held the man's hand, turned around softly, grabbed the man's collar, and the man asked.
0:21:56|0:21:59|[Le Er] happily embraces the man, and the two of them joyfully hug each other tightly.
0:22:11|0:22:13|The man teasingly tickled [Le Er]'s feet.
0:22:15|0:22:32|The next day, [Zhang Nan] drove a luxury sports car, speeding on the road. On the empty highway, the car roared like a lion, its speed as if bestowed with angelic wings, under the enveloping sunlight, it seemed to have a faint halo, exuding a compelling dynamic energy at the intersection.
0:22:43|0:23:3|The rider blocked the path of [Zhang Nan]'s car and quickly drove away. [Zhang Nan] adjusted his mood and continued driving to the banquet venue. [Zhang Nan] led [Le Er] in her finery to attend. [Le Er] wore a long dress, attracting attention, and the two walked slowly into the venue.
0:23:12|0:23:21|The two sat down, and the man with glasses raised his glass and handed it to [Zhang Nan].
0:23:53|0:24:3|[Zhang Nan] is followed by several beautiful women.
0:24:36|0:24:51|[Le Er] stopped shaking the wine glass in her hand, sneering at [Zhang Nan]. After locking eyes with [Zhang Nan] for a moment, [Le Er] rolled her eyes, stood up, and walked away without looking back. She headed towards the stage, took off her high heels, and stepped onto the stage to dance a duet with the man on stage.
0:24:51|0:25:4|Watching as [Zhang Nan] suddenly changes his expression in the audience, [Le Er] sensually twists her body, her captivating eyes bewitching the soul. She shines brightly on the stage, exuding great confidence. The lights on the stage are all overshadowed by [Le Er]'s radiance, not even half as dazzling as her.
0:25:6|0:25:21|The audience in the audience were all attracted by [Le Er]'s dance moves, applauding and praising. With the male dancer's guidance, [Le Er] spun, bent her waist, and struck a sexy pose. [Zhang Nan] was stunned, with a smile in his eyes. However, the following movements of [Le Er] became more and more daring.
0:25:24|0:25:35|The male dancer even touched [Le Er]'s perky buttocks. [Zhang Nan] instantly changed his expression, leaning forward and staring at [Le Er] who was dancing passionately on stage. [Le Er] looked down at [Zhang Nan], and the two locked eyes.
0:25:35|0:25:40|[Le Er] ambitiously leans to the side, while [Zhang Nan] lowers his eyes without looking at [Le Er], puts down his glass, and angrily leaves the table.
0:25:41|0:25:55|Standing at the door, she looked back at the stage reluctantly. Le Er, who was deeply engaged in dancing a duet, noticed Zhang Nan leaving. Seeing Zhang Nan's lonely figure, she stopped in her tracks, left the stage, leaving the male dancer standing alone in place.
0:25:57|0:26:19|[Le Er] walked out of the gate with a smile, only to see [Zhang Nan] standing outside, looking angry. [Le Er] lowered her head with a smile, unable to suppress the smile on her lips, and slowly walked to [Zhang Nan], reaching out her hand and leaning against the wall next to him, showing her dominance. [Le Er] teasingly spoke up.
0:26:19|0:26:23|[Zhang Nan] deliberately avoided looking at [Le Er], tilted his head to one side and whistled, making [Le Er] laugh.
0:26:39|0:26:51|[Zhang Nan] easily controlled by [Le Er]'s sweet smile, the two of them burst into laughter as they looked at each other. On the stairs in the distance, a man wearing a hat hid behind the glass, secretly filming the scene of the two laughing, while they were completely unaware.
0:26:51|0:27:0|The two arrived at the mall, with [Le Er] fixated on a diamond ring, [Zhang Nan] leaned in and asked [Le Er].
0:27:4|0:27:16|The two of them arrived at the supermarket again, with [Le Er] constantly putting snacks into the cart while [Zhang Nan] pushed the cart filled with snacks behind. Seeing [Le Er] lingering in the potato chips section, [Zhang Nan] said.
0:27:25|0:27:35|[Zhang Nan] looked at the full car of snacks, [Le Er] reached out her hand and pulled [Zhang Nan] along. [Zhang Nan] kept looking back at the car of snacks, hesitated, but then followed [Le Er], and the two were ready to leave the supermarket. As they passed the exit.
0:27:41|0:27:47|[Zhang Nan] looked around, then felt his own clothes pockets to confirm, his eyes widened in surprise as he pulled out several boxes of condoms from his pocket.
0:28:6|0:28:31|[Le Er] pulled [Zhang Nan] and ran, the two of them sprinted through the mall, dodging the pursuit of the security guards. They ran to the escalator, with the security guards close behind. So the two of them ran back down the escalator, going up and down, until they escaped. In the middle of the mall, [Zhang Nan] taunted.
0:29:3|0:29:8|Zhang Nan pushed open the door, [Le Er] pouted and made a face at Zhang Nan, who helplessly stared at [Le Er].
0:29:34|0:29:40|In the memory, [Le Er] is a baby crying in the wall fortress.
0:29:47|0:30:3|[Le Er] told [Zhang Nan] about her past, and after listening, [Zhang Nan] felt a myriad of emotions, feeling that he now understood the beautiful woman in front of him even more, his smile deepening. At night, [Le Er] returned home alone, slowly stepping into the living room, only to find a man lying on the sofa, already fast asleep.
0:30:3|0:30:12|Watching the man sleeping peacefully, [Le Er] recalled scenes of herself practicing ballet in the past. She always fell in the same place while practicing dance, and the man caught her from behind.
0:30:24|0:30:35|[Le Er] thought about the past friendship with men, complex emotions surged in her eyes. Hearing the message alert on her phone, she lowered her head, opened her bag, took out her phone, and held it against her chest to block it.
0:30:35|0:30:46|Later, [Le Er] cautiously glanced at the man sitting on the sofa, then continued to read the message. At this moment, the man opened his eyes and stared at [Le Er]. [Le Er] received a message from [Zhang Nan], which read:
0:30:48|0:30:56|The man frowned and turned over when he saw the smile on [Le Er]'s face. The next morning, he stood on the rooftop, looking into the distance and reminiscing about his childhood.
0:31:23|0:31:34|In his childhood, he watched his mother leave without looking back at the entrance of the welfare home. Thinking of this, darkness enveloped the man's heart again, and at night, Zhang Nan took Le Er to the seaside for a date.
0:31:44|0:31:56|Beside the two of them, a small boat lit up. [Le Er] sighed, [Le Er] walked slowly and excitedly towards the boat, getting closer. There was no one on the beach, and this exquisite little boat illuminated the entire coastline.
0:31:56|0:32:3|[Zhang Nan] strides forward, runs to the side of the small boat, takes [Le Er]'s hand, and she leads [Le Er] slowly up the stairs, creating a very romantic scene.
0:32:4|0:32:19|[Zhang Nan] gentlemanly escorts [Le Er] onto the small boat, then guides her to take a seat. [Le Er] sits elegantly on the chair, with [Zhang Nan] sitting beside her. As [Le Er] gazes at the exquisite small boat in front of her, her mind wanders.
0:32:31|0:32:48|Le Er turned her head and saw lights shining not far away. Under the lights were the elderly people in the nursing home, dressed neatly and dancing formally. They sang together on the steps. Le Er was so moved that she covered her mouth. As the elderly people started singing, Le Er clapped and cheered for them excitedly, continuously giving them thumbs up to encourage them.
0:32:48|0:32:57|The elderly people were inspired and sang confidently. [Le Er] looked gratefully at [Zhang Nan], who gestured with his eyes and then made encouraging gestures to the elderly people.
0:33:6|0:33:21|[Zhang Nan] gazed affectionately at [Le Er], who turned her head and looked back at [Zhang Nan] with gentle eyes. [Zhang Nan] smiled without saying a word, then gestured for [Le Er] to look up at the sky. Following [Zhang Nan]'s gaze, beautiful snowflakes fell onto [Le Er]'s embroidered hair.
0:33:21|0:33:29|Le Er reached out to touch the falling snowflakes, the crystal-clear snowflakes were pure and flawless, symbolizing pure and romantic love.
0:33:30|0:33:45|The two of them laughed happily in the heavy snow. The snowmaker worked hard to blow snowflakes, creating a romantic scene for the two. [Le Er] slowly stood up and walked to the middle of the boat, opened her arms, joyfully and happily spun around, carefully catching each snowflake.
0:33:45|0:33:51|[Zhang Nan] saw this scene and was deeply moved. He quietly walked up behind [Le Er] and took out a jewelry box from his pocket.
0:34:19|0:34:24|[Zhang Nan] took out the diamond ring that [Le Er] had seen in the mall before, and put it on [Le Er]'s finger.
0:34:36|0:34:52|The two of them smiled at each other on their blind date, then went to the room. [Le Er] was wearing a camisole, showing off her curves. She leaned on [Zhang Nan] and pouted. [Zhang Nan] turned over, pressed [Le Er] down, and then passionately kissed her. As their emotions intensified, they became extremely intimate.
0:34:52|0:34:58|In the distance, a man is holding binoculars, silently watching the actions of [Le Er] and [Zhang Nan] through the window and the hazy curtains.
0:34:59|0:35:15|The two embraced each other passionately, kissing each other deeply. Seeing their kiss, the man gritted his teeth and slowly lowered his binoculars, calming himself down. With red eyes, he turned away from the two, lowered his gaze, and in his mind echoed the promise he made to [Le Er] during his childhood in the orphanage.
0:35:31|0:35:45|The man's thoughts returned to the present, leaning against the wall and breathing heavily. He turned his head angrily, refusing to look at [Le Er]. The next morning, with the tide surging and the sunlight shining, [Le Er] arrived at the seaside, her mind filled with the man's childhood promises to her.
0:35:59|0:36:23|[Le Er] strolled along the beach, squinting at the sea, then closed her eyes. Meanwhile, [Zhang Nan] was still fast asleep in the room, stretching lazily and trying to embrace [Le Er] as he turned over. He reached out and found that there was no longer the warmth of [Le Er] by his side. [Zhang Nan] sat up with his eyes half-closed, not yet fully awake from his dream, calling out for her.
0:36:32|0:36:48|Zhang Nan quickly put on his pants, searched the room but couldn't find [Le Er]. Looking at the empty room, he sat down on the bed in disappointment. With a gloomy face, a complex and strange emotion surged in Zhang Nan's heart. He couldn't think of where [Le Er] could have gone, but he saw the wallet with the zipper opened by the bedside.
0:36:48|0:36:57|Zhang Nan flipped through his wallet, unzipped the compartment, only to find it empty. Anxiously, Zhang Nan hurried to the hotel front desk, looking around as he walked.
0:37:10|0:37:29|After receiving the hotel clerk's reply, [Zhang Nan] felt extremely disappointed. She helplessly came to the seaside, blowing the cold sea breeze, running frantically, searching for the missing [Le Er]. The seaside was full of couples, she dialed [Le Er]'s number but couldn't get through, becoming more and more desperate.
0:37:41|0:37:48|[Zhang Nan] tiptoed to look inside the nursing home, the furnishings were neat but there was no one around, as if the nursing home didn't exist at all.
0:37:52|0:38:2|[Zhang Nan] angrily drove away in a sports car, while the man watched [Zhang Nan] leave from the top of the nursing home. At night, the man carefully examined [Le Er]'s ring at [Le Er]'s house.
0:38:10|0:38:13|[Le Er] catches the ring thrown by the man and is pulled onto the sofa.
0:39:22|0:39:32|Originally, the man had prepared a truck early in the morning and took the old ladies away. At the same time, [Zhang Nan] was getting drunk in the bar. She was a bit tipsy, swaying, with people around her still urging her to drink.
0:39:43|0:39:53|[Zhang Nan] kept drinking glass after glass, his mind gradually becoming muddled, unable to see clearly the scene around him. The lights were spinning in his eyes, and the woman sitting next to him was still clinking glasses with him.
0:39:57|0:40:12|Just as [Zhang Nan] was in a daze, a familiar figure appeared before his eyes. [Le Er] was walking towards him in a sparkling short skirt, the same one as before, as if nothing had changed. [Zhang Nan] stood up to confirm, his eyes misty, with a smile in his eyes.
0:40:12|0:40:24|Once again, [Zhang Nan] confirmed, his eyes blurred, and the figure of [Le Er] in front of him turned into a stranger. [Zhang Nan] lowered his head, sat down in despair, and the woman beside him made room for the girl who had just been sitting next to [Zhang Nan].
0:40:31|0:40:48|[Zhang Nan] fell onto the girl's legs beside him. One day, [Le Er] stood on a small hill by the sea with her long hair blowing in the wind. [Zhang Nan] sat on the balcony of the room looking at the distant scenery, with champagne placed beside him. [Le Er] dialed that familiar phone number.
0:40:58|0:41:10|[Zhang Nan] received a phone call, raised her phone, and saw that it was from [Le Er]. She took a deep breath to calm herself, feeling a surge of indescribable complex emotions. [Zhang Nan] finally answered the call.
0:41:22|0:41:37|[Zhang Nan] had just finished speaking when [Le Er] hung up the phone. [Zhang Nan] stood up with the phone in hand, looking anxious to leave. She glanced around the room, grabbed the car keys from the table, and walked out of the room. On the other end of the phone, [Le Er], who had hung up, crossed her arms and felt relieved.
0:41:37|0:41:43|[Le Er] looked into the distance, while [Zhang Nan] drove the sports car wildly. [Le Er] got out of the car to greet the elderly people coming back to the nursing home.
0:42:6|0:42:24|[Zhang Nan]'s car was parked outside [Le Er]'s residential area, but he didn't see [Le Er] anywhere. He anxiously called [Le Er]'s phone, but no one answered. [Zhang Nan] felt helpless after his anticipation turned into disappointment once again, and he could only stand by the car waiting boredly. Even at night, [Le Er] was nowhere to be seen.
0:42:24|0:42:34|He returned home disappointed, only to find a table full of exquisite dishes on the dining table. [Zhang Nan] instantly woke up and turned to see [Le Er] sleeping on the sofa.
0:42:36|0:42:52|He walked softly to [Le Er]'s side, looking at her peaceful sleeping face with joy in his eyes. He knelt down beside [Le Er] gently and carefully, not wanting to disturb her, and raised his hand to caress her softly. [Le Er] hugged [Zhang Nan] tightly.
0:43:13|0:43:24|[Zhang Nan] cherishes [Le Er] very much, he tightly hugs [Le Er] and responds to her with great force, as if trying to blend [Le Er] into his own body. During the days they are apart, [Zhang Nan] misses her immensely.
0:43:24|0:43:40|We finally see [Le Er] now, with [Zhang Nan] burying his head in her arms, then embracing and kissing her passionately. The next morning, [Le Er] tidied up her hair, dressed up beautifully, and sat on the sofa lost in thought with a pillow. [Zhang Nan] looked refreshed and walked over with a cheerful smile.
0:44:21|0:44:30|Zhang Nan and [Le Er] joked around before getting up and heading out. Outside the stadium gate, a manager greeted a black sedan, and a middle-aged man with glasses stepped out from the car.
0:44:41|0:44:52|[Le Er] dressed up as a hotel staff for her first love, opened the car door, a short-haired and capable middle-aged woman got out of the car, stretched her arm, the man kept staring at her, and finally called out.
0:45:36|0:45:50|[Mrs. Zhang] glanced up and down at [Le Er], pursing her lips and pulling [Zhang Nan] along. The crowd walked into the building, while a man on the side clenched banknotes, glaring fiercely as the crowd left.
0:46:2|0:46:21|The man recalls his childhood, the young [Mrs. Zhang] pushes the little boy away and leads [Zhang Nan] and his family forward. Tears hidden by hatred in the man's eyes, he stares at [Zhang Nan] and his family, while [Mrs. Zhang] swings her club to hit the golf ball in the field.
0:46:29|0:46:40|[Zhang Nan] took off his gloves, sat down on a nearby seat to rest, with [Le Er] also resting on a seat. [Zhang Nan] shook his tea cup, glanced at [Le Er], and slowly asked.
0:46:49|0:46:53|[Le Er] raises her glass to cover her face, while [Zhang Nan] also raises his glass to drink tea.
0:47:0|0:47:4|[Zhang Nan] paused for a moment, then set down the teacup and said.
0:47:41|0:47:51|[Le Er] received a satisfactory answer and smiled triumphantly. [Zhang Nan] looked at the girl in front of him with a worried expression. Zhang Nan impatiently helped his mother into the car.
0:48:18|0:48:36|Zhang Nan embraced [Le Er] and watched as [Mrs. Zhang] left. [Le Er]'s first love hid behind the curtain, silently watching the departing car, pulling down the brim of his hat to hide his lonely expression. At night, [Zhang Nan] drove a sports car to take [Le Er] home, weaving through the bustling traffic.
0:48:43|0:49:3|Le Er felt lost, leaning against the car window as Zhang Nan's car sped away. The next morning, Le Er's first love sat on the rooftop of the nursing home, holding a photo in his hand. Looking at the photo, the man furrowed his brows tightly, clenched his fist in anger, crumpled the photo, and it fell onto the man's camera bag.
0:49:6|0:49:41|In the photo is the happy family of [Zhang Nan]. [Zhang Nan] answers a phone call in the parking lot, getting ready to drive. Just as [Zhang Nan] reaches the car, he is knocked down by a masked person from behind. The masked person takes [Zhang Nan]'s phone. Inside the nursing home, [Le Er] is having a meal with the elderly.
0:50:16|0:50:26|Next to the seaside factory, tall weeds grew. [Le Er] looked towards the factory, pushed aside the weeds and walked forward with determination, but she couldn't find the factory gate and couldn't enter the factory.
0:50:28|0:50:50|[Le Er] peeled away the weeds and finally arrived at the window, but the factory windows were all surrounded by iron mesh. So, [Le Er] observed the terrain inside the factory and continued to look for the main entrance. Through the window, [Le Er] saw that the factory was filled with cardboard boxes. He kept walking and saw the kidnappers inside the factory drinking.
0:51:4|0:51:21|[Le Er] almost caught the attention of the kidnappers, so he got up and hid. Finally, [Le Er] found an entrance to a factory and carefully crept forward. Zhang Nan had his hands tied and was hanging on the wall.
0:51:36|0:51:51|The kidnappers ran to the other side, [Le Er] hid behind a wall not far away, silently watching everything. Taking advantage of the kidnappers' departure, he ran forward to take cover next to a pile of cardboard boxes. Seeing [Zhang Nan] being beaten with blood all over his face, [Le Er] ran over with aching heart, avoiding the kidnappers' sight.
0:51:52|0:52:2|Taking advantage of the kidnappers' distraction, [Le Er] finally managed to run to [Zhang Nan]'s side, shouting anxiously. [Le Er] was on the verge of tears, frantically tearing off the tape covering [Zhang Nan]'s mouth.
0:52:18|0:52:22|[Le Er] saw the rope tied to the pillar and ran over to untie it.
0:53:4|0:53:8|One of the kidnappers was shot by [Le Er]'s first love with an arrow and fell to the ground, while the other kidnapper said.
0:53:14|0:53:16|[Le Er] quickly picked up the knife on the ground.
0:53:27|0:53:43|[Le Er] carried the injured [Zhang Nan], but inadvertently caught sight of the weapon used by the bandits against the police. For a moment, she was stunned, her mind racing. However, [Le Er] remained composed as she supported [Zhang Nan] out of the seaside factory. The two of them helped each other, running away from the factory.
0:53:44|0:54:2|Le Er's first love stood at the top of the factory, silently watching her, helping Zhang Nan escape. His expression was complicated, gritting his teeth, his thoughts recalling the past. He had also ridden a motorcycle with Le Er, weaving through the streets, the two of them cheering and laughing on deserted streets, innocent and carefree.
0:54:3|0:54:24|[Le Er] reached out her hand, opened her arms to feel the shape of the wind, but now all memories have become the past. Now, the man can only watch [Le Er] leave with red eyes, feeling unwillingness and regret in his heart. At night, the man went to [Le Er]'s house and rudely pushed her against the wall.
0:54:35|0:54:44|[Le Er] pushed the man away, took out the weapon from the man's clothes and questioned him. [Yun Chuan] froze, released [Le Er], put his hands in his pockets, and dared not look at him.
0:55:18|0:55:32|[Yun Chuan] rudely pushed [Le Er] onto the sofa. Feeling forced, [Le Er] slapped [Yun Chuan] in the face. [Yun Chuan] stood there stunned, holding his face. [Le Er] took the opportunity to push [Yun Chuan] away, crying as she ran out of the room, leaving [Yun Chuan] sitting alone on the sofa. He sat there muttering to himself, trying to convince himself over and over again.
0:55:36|0:55:48|[Yun Chuan] took deep breaths, trying to calm his shocked and surprised emotions. [Le Er] had never hit herself before, and the thought of [Le Er] hitting herself for another man made [Yun Chuan] feel very uncomfortable.
0:55:48|0:56:3|[Yun Chuan], pretending to be strong, finally calmed down a bit and left [Le Er]'s home. He rode his motorcycle on the bustling street, unable to control his emotions. Tears welled up in his eyes, from sniffles to sobs, and finally he shouted out loud, releasing his pent-up feelings.
0:56:5|0:56:16|He roared loudly as if no one was around, [Yun Chuan] accelerated the speed of cycling, Xie Qiu's eyes concealed with pride and strength, leaving only the deep loneliness and powerlessness in his eyes.
0:56:16|0:56:34|Unaware of all this, [Le Er] was alone in the bathroom taking a pregnancy test. Seeing two lines on the test stick, [Le Er] was momentarily unsure of what to do. After a moment of silence, he went to the beach alone. Deep in thought, [Le Er] replayed the promises made by [Zhang Nan] and [Yun Chuan] in his mind.
0:57:3|0:57:8|Excitedly answering the phone when [Le Er] heard it ringing.
0:57:29|0:57:42|[Le Er] stopped touching the toast in her hand, while [Zhang Nan] poured orange juice backwards. [Le Er] hung up the phone nervously, and [Zhang Nan] finished the orange juice and asked.
0:58:1|0:58:20|[Zhang Nan] picked up the bread crumbs and walked happily to the door, with [Le Er] following behind to straighten [Zhang Nan]'s collar. [Le Er] was still immersed in happiness with [Zhang Nan] when the door was suddenly pushed open forcefully. [Le Er] turned around in shock, only to find that it was [Yun Chuan].
0:58:24|0:58:50|[Zhang Nan] was driving when he reached into his pocket and found it empty. Realizing he had forgotten his wallet, [Zhang Nan] turned back home, while [Le Er] was being pulled into the residential area by [Yun Chuan]. [Yun Chuan] dragged [Le Er] to a pavilion, and [Le Er] kept struggling to break free.
0:59:52|0:59:58|[Le Er] looked determined, not letting [Yun Chuan] touch him. [Yun Chuan] glared at him fiercely, raising his finger towards [Le Er] and said angrily.
1:0:32|1:0:35|[Zhang Nan] approached with a smile, looking at the person next to [Le Er].
1:1:30|1:1:36|[Le Er] was eating when suddenly she felt nauseous. [Yun Chuan] angrily looked away from [Le Er], while [Zhang Nan] asked with concern.
1:1:45|1:1:48|[Le Er] looked at [Yun Chuan] in shock as he grabbed her hand.
1:2:48|1:2:59|After making sure that [Zhang Nan] was sound asleep, [Le Er] finally got up quietly, walked to the end of the bed, pulled back the curtains, and looked out the window, her expression complex as she pondered.
1:2:59|1:3:11|At this moment, [Le Er]'s phone rang. She ruthlessly hung up the call, then her phone rang again. [Le Er] quickly ended the call, looking nervously at [Zhang Nan].
1:3:12|1:3:39|Shortly after, he crossed his arms in front of his chest, his eyes looking into the distance. Outside the window, the sound of engines starting could be heard, but [Zhang Nan] was oblivious to it all, still deeply asleep, with a peaceful expression. The next day, [Zhang Nan] was driving when his phone rang. He glanced at the phone and answered it silently.
1:3:52|1:4:0|[Zhang Nan], confident and brave, hung up the phone, put down the mobile phone, gripped the steering wheel with both hands, and arrived at the agreed location with [Yun Chuan], Xuri Building.
1:4:3|1:4:19|[Yun Chuan] stood on a box on the rooftop, overlooking the ground, just as [Zhang Nan] arrived at the rooftop of the Sunrise Building. Seeing [Yun Chuan], [Zhang Nan] slowly but steadily approached him. [Yun Chuan] saw [Zhang Nan] and turned around, jumped off the box, and walked slowly towards [Zhang Nan].
1:4:19|1:4:28|Like a cheetah spotting its prey, [Yun Chuan] lowered his head and stared at [Zhang Nan]. The two were one meter apart, standing with their hands in their pockets, and [Yun Chuan] spoke first.
1:4:33|1:4:38|[Zhang Nan] stared at [Yun Chuan] and shook his head firmly. Perplexed, [Yun Chuan] looked at [Zhang Nan] and asked.
1:4:42|1:4:45|[Yun Chuan] listened, sneered, lowered his head and continued to ask.
1:5:11|1:5:13|[Yun Chuan] sneered and clapped his hands.
1:5:40|1:6:3|It turns out that the waiter by the pool is [Yun Chuan], who hands a glass of red wine to [Le Er]. It turns out that the DJ in the nightclub is also [Yun Chuan], who has been giving meaningful looks to [Le Er]. [Yun Chuan] approaches [Zhang Nan] while talking and takes out a credit card.
1:6:48|1:7:5|[Yun Chuan] threw the ring that [Zhang Nan] had given to [Le Er] during his confession onto [Zhang Nan]'s hand. [Zhang Nan] stared at the ring on his hand, tightly gripping it, with a look of disappointment in his eyes. He angrily walked away from the rooftop. Meanwhile, [Le Er] was completely unaware of the confrontation between the two men, still celebrating Grandma Li's birthday in the karaoke lounge.
1:7:20|1:7:35|[Le Er] blew out the candles with the elderly, and the lights instantly lit up. Meanwhile, [Zhang Nan] sadly threw away his phone, drinking alone at home to drown his sorrows. He poured himself a full glass of alcohol, feeling a splitting headache but still heartbroken.
1:7:38|1:7:52|At this moment, [Yun Chuan] is standing on a rooftop, smirking as he looks at his phone and chuckles triumphantly. He puts down his phone, while on the other side in the karaoke hall, [Le Er] is singing "Sweet Honey" with the elderly, everyone having a great time. Suddenly, [Le Er] receives a message on her phone.
1:8:21|1:8:41|[Le Er] pondered with his phone against his chest, feeling nervous as he returned home. Seeing the empty bottles of wine on the coffee table, one after another. He took out his keys, turned on the lights, took off his high heels, and put on his slippers. As he walked strangely towards the living room, he closed his key card holder. And [Zhang Nan] appeared from the other side of the staircase.
1:8:41|1:8:44|Upon seeing [Le Er], [Zhang Nan] cried out with a sob.
1:8:48|1:8:52|[Zhang Nan] approached but pushed away [Le Er]'s hug, questioning with red eyes.
1:9:7|1:9:23|[Le Er] tried to escape in distress, but was rudely pulled back by [Zhang Nan]. [Zhang Nan] pushed [Le Er] against the wall. [Zhang Nan] took out a stack of long papers.
1:9:26|1:9:44|[Zhang Nan] placed all the money in [Le Er]'s hands. [Zhang Nan] suppressed his sadness and continued to hand over the money.
1:9:50|1:10:12|[Le Er] was rudely thrown onto the sofa by [Zhang Nan], her body hitting the sofa heavily. [Le Er] cried in pain, shaking her head, as [Zhang Nan] pointed at her. [Zhang Nan] suddenly slapped [Le Er] across the face, causing her to fall onto the sofa, holding her face.
1:10:12|1:10:16|[Zhang Nan] realized his actions and cried in pain, slowly sitting down on the sofa.
1:10:18|1:10:30|[Le Er] endured the discomfort, propped up her body, and looked tearfully at [Zhang Nan]. [Zhang Nan] was also heartbroken, tears welling up in his eyes, and slowly spoke.
1:10:45|1:11:0|[Zhang Nan] felt more and more heartbroken as he spoke, turning his head away and not looking at [Le Er]. [Le Er] covered her face, crying with tears streaming down her face, while [Zhang Nan] sorrowfully poured out his heart.
1:11:30|1:11:37|[Le Er] shook her head sadly, while [Zhang Nan] bowed his head in pain and wept, tears streaming down his face. He pinched [Le Er]'s cheek and said.
1:11:48|1:11:58|[Le Er] shook her head in regret, while [Zhang Nan] looked disappointed and despondent. They both lowered their heads and avoided eye contact. [Zhang Nan] wiped away his tears with his hand covering his face, then he pretended to be strong and lifted his head to speak.
1:12:27|1:12:36|Suddenly, [Le Er]'s phone rang, and it was a call from [Yun Chuan]. [Zhang Nan] pointed at the phone, angrily walked away. [Le Er] didn't pick up the phone, instead she ran towards [Zhang Nan] and hugged her.
1:12:43|1:13:4|[Le Er] tightly hugged [Zhang Nan] from behind and refused to let go, both of them in tears, but the phone kept ringing at the wrong time. [Zhang Nan] shook his head in anguish, crying as he tried to pry [Le Er]'s hands off her. [Zhang Nan] heartlessly pushed away [Le Er]'s hand, crying uncontrollably.
1:13:4|1:13:11|[Le Er] stayed in place, motionless, quietly gasping for breath. [Zhang Nan] slammed the door shut, leaving [Le Er] alone in place, causing her to tremble in fear.
1:13:15|1:13:26|[Le Er] watched [Zhang Nan] leave without looking back, standing in place and gasping in distress. She helplessly squatted down, slowly knelt, and finally sat on her heels, hands supporting her legs, crying out in pain.
1:13:32|1:13:40|That night, two sorrowful individuals were feeling melancholic in secret. [Zhang Nan] was alone at home, staring at the ring filled with sweet memories of the two of them.
1:13:43|1:13:45|[Le Er] stayed up all night, silently crying on the sofa.
1:13:49|1:14:10|[Zhang Nan] lay on the bed, drinking cola heavily, throwing away the empty cans of Irn-Bru, tears kept falling uncontrollably. After finishing one bottle of cola, [Zhang Nan] then opened another one and drank it crazily. However, [Le Er] was also feeling miserable, sitting alone at home feeling restless, cooked three pots of instant noodles, and cried while finishing them.
1:14:10|1:14:35|She numbed her inner self with binge eating, but the pain only grew. After a long time, one late night, [Zhang Nan] knocked on the door of the nursing home. A lady came out to open the door for [Zhang Nan], who asked. [Zhang Nan] was caught off guard by her grandmother's question and could only shake her head.
1:15:28|1:15:41|[Zhang Nan] looked at the unfamiliar bracelet on grandma's hand, then looked at the kind old people lost in thought. [Zhang Nan] sighed as he looked at the grandpas and grandmas around him, his mind filled with mixed emotions. On another day, [Le Er] reminisced about his farewell with [Yun Chuan] on the mountain.
1:15:53|1:16:14|On the rooftop of the nursing home, [Yun Chuan] skillfully shoots out sharp weapons with such force and speed that they can pierce through a bottle of cola. He smiles proudly and mysteriously, slowly lowering his weapon with a complex expression. The sun is shining brightly, the breeze is gentle, and the sea waves envelop the dazzling Linbo.
1:16:14|1:16:24|On the other side of the shore, the small boat where [Zhang Nan] and [Le Er] once pledged their love is still moored. [Le Er], dressed up in high heels, arrived at the boat filled with memories.
1:16:24|1:16:33|He caressed the hull, slowly moving forward. After walking a few steps, reluctantly facing the hull, [Le Er] looked towards the coastline, memories of the past flashing through her mind.
1:16:34|1:16:47|The character was overwhelmed by a mix of sorrow and sweet memories, as if he had recalled something. [Le Er] lowered his head and looked at the small boat, reaching out to touch the edge of the boat with deep emotion, then a look of sorrow appeared on his face.
1:16:47|1:17:0|[Le Er] turned his gaze back to the sea, leaning against the boat, reminiscing about the past full of memories that he couldn't bear to let go of, and the person he deeply loved. So he picked up his phone, dialed the number, and called the person he was most familiar with.
1:17:25|1:17:39|[Zhang Nan] hung up the phone and then drove the sports car speeding towards the seaside. [Le Er] crossed her arms in front of her chest, excitedly and nervously waiting for [Zhang Nan]. The sea breeze made [Le Er] feel a bit cold, while [Yun Chuan] suddenly appeared at [Le Er]'s side from behind.
1:17:39|1:17:57|[Yun Chuan] slowly approached [Le Er] from the side of the small boat. Sensing the movement behind her, [Le Er] turned around with anticipation to embrace the person behind her, only to be startled to find that it was [Yun Chuan]. [Le Er] was frightened, but [Yun Chuan] quickly grabbed her, locking his hand around her throat from behind.
1:18:42|1:18:44|[Zhang Nan] appeared like a savior.
1:18:55|1:19:0|[Yun Chuan] quietly took out a weapon from behind and aimed it at [Le Er].
1:19:29|1:19:33|[Yun Chuan] took out an old photo, which showed him and Mrs. [Zhang Nan].
1:20:18|1:20:21|[Le Er] looked at [Zhang Nan] with concern as [Yun Chuan] put down his weapon.
1:20:24|1:20:39|Le Er looked back at Zhang Nan reluctantly, then threw herself into Yun Chuan's arms. Yun Chuan smirked triumphantly at Zhang Nan, who looked on in despair. At that moment, Le Er let go of Yun Chuan's hand, left his embrace, took a step back, and then ran towards Zhang Nan.
1:20:39|1:20:48|[Zhang Nan] gradually unfolds a smile, [Yun Chuan] breaks down emotionally, he shouts loudly, raises his weapon high, goes crazy aiming at [Zhang Nan], and screams in despair.
1:20:49|1:21:5|[Le Er] was shocked to see [Yun Chuan] aiming at [Zhang Nan], and stood frozen in place for a moment. As [Yun Chuan] was about to launch the weapon, [Le Er] quickly opened her arms and stood in front of [Zhang Nan]. The weapon was fired by [Yun Chuan], and [Le Er] helped block it for [Zhang Nan], causing the weapon to pierce into [Le Er]'s chest.
1:21:5|1:21:8|Le Er was hit, took two steps back, and fell into Zhang Nan's arms.
1:21:8|1:21:23|The two of them lay on the ground, with [Le Er]'s chest soaked in blood, his expression full of pain. He looked at [Le Er] with regret, then dropped his weapon. Nearby, some enthusiastic citizens called the police, who rushed to the scene. [Zhang Nan] anxiously called out to [Le Er].
1:21:31|1:21:58|[Yun Chuan] dropped his weapon, knelt on the beach, his expression filled with pain and uncontrollable tears. The police arrived, captured [Yun Chuan], and he looked towards [Le Er]. After [Le Er] finished speaking, she collapsed on the ground in discomfort, using up the last bit of her strength.
1:22:4|1:22:16|[Zhang Nan] screamed in despair, but could no longer call back [Le Er]. [Le Er] quietly fell into [Zhang Nan]'s arms, the dress on her chest already stained with blood. [Zhang Nan] continued to call out for [Le Er] desperately.
1:22:16|1:22:30|[Zhang Nan] closed his eyes and called out, with flashbacks of the first encounter with [Le Er] by the seaside playing in his mind. [Le Er], in a long dress, elegantly walked towards him, and at that moment, [Zhang Nan] knew that everything was destined, even if [Le Er] made him fall into the water.
1:22:38|1:22:56|[Zhang Nan] flashes back to the moments spent with [Le Er] in the past, every smile and frown of [Le Er], as well as her adorable antics, stirring up his emotions. After falling in love, [Le Er] cooks for him and gives him warm hugs before he leaves, making [Zhang Nan] feel extra warm and loved.
1:22:58|1:23:10|Every time Le Er looks at herself, her smile is so sweet. On the small boat, Zhang Nan brings snowflakes to Le Er, making her smile so bright. Those moments of joy and romance are so real, so close.
1:23:29|1:23:45|[Zhang Nan] held [Le Er] in pain as they both fell to the ground, the two young lovers crying so desolately on the sunny beach. [Zhang Nan] could never get back his beloved, he cried out in despair, telling [Le Er] in a state of confusion, repeating it over and over again.
1:23:51|1:24:5|However, [Le Er] could no longer hear, feelings of regret, sadness, and complex despair surged in [Zhang Nan]'s heart. [Le Er] lay peacefully in [Zhang Nan]'s arms on the beach, with a small boat beside them witnessing their love.
1:24:5|1:24:9|The poignant scene freezes here, preserving their memories of love and pain.
