0:0:26|0:0:42|A sedan is driving on a small road, with three men in neat Zhongshan suits inside. The sedan stops at the gate, and a rough hand knocks on the wooden door. As the sedan drives off again, the number of men inside changes from three to four. The man who got in the car turns and asks.
0:0:52|0:1:12|He turned back thoughtfully, quietly looking at the road ahead. The buildings outside the car window displayed the national emblem, solemn and dignified. Time took him back to his childhood memories, with the scorching sun hanging in the sky. A ragged little boy looked around, standing still in place, calmly watching the passersby in front of him.
0:1:13|0:1:22|The scene on the bridge was originally bustling, with vendors setting up stalls and carrying loads, conducting their business in an orderly manner, and the continuous cries of selling goods filling the air.
0:1:22|0:1:36|The stall displayed a variety of goods that caught people's attention. A middle-aged man concealed a piece of brocade in his hand, while a wrestling match took place with great excitement. A young man agilely leaped behind his opponent, and a juggler was flipping a large prop to reveal a treasure ball.
0:1:36|0:2:0|The wrestling match has determined the winner, and the young boy is walking aimlessly on the street. Suddenly, he hears the sound of fast-paced drumming ahead and quickly steps forward to squeeze into the crowd. The gentleman thanks the audience and then struggles to stand up, trembling and unsteady on his knees.
0:2:0|0:2:10|The young boy picked up the tip money on the ground and walked towards [Mr.], who looked at the boy, glanced at the money in his hand, and then waved it away directly.
0:2:39|0:2:50|The young boy hurriedly picked up the props on the ground. [Mr. Gao Fengshan] stared at the boy in front of him. The boy froze.
0:2:56|0:3:11|The boy walked away dejectedly, and [Mr.] watched his departing figure with a calm expression that seemed to have seen through the hardships of the world. Carrying his props, [Mr.] walked into the alley and suddenly stopped in his tracks, noticing the little boy curled up sleeping on a sack.
0:3:11|0:3:27|He walked up to the boy and looked at him quietly, then lowered his head to look at the pocket on his chest. He reached into the pocket and felt around for a moment, then looked down at what was in his hand, slowly approached the boy and looked at him. The little boy had his hands crossed in front of him, sleeping quietly.
0:3:27|0:3:40|[Mr.] lifted the things off his shoulders and slowly placed them on the sack beside the little boy's head. He bent down and placed the things in his hands in front of the little boy, his movements gentle and full of pity.
0:3:42|0:3:54|After doing all this, he picked up his belongings, slowly got up, put the luggage back on his shoulders, and left without any nostalgia. At this moment, the little boy opened his eyes.
0:3:57|0:4:4|In a blink of an eye, [Gao Fengshan] returned to his home, leaning against the table corner while sitting on a chair, hands supporting his left knee, massaging it repeatedly.
0:4:6|0:4:13|A woman in plain clothes walks up and hands the neatly folded towel to [Gao Fengshan]. She sits on a small stool nearby.
0:4:21|0:4:24|The woman sighed as she leaned against [Gao Fengshan]'s knee.
0:5:10|0:5:20|The little boy standing outside the door listening to the music turned and left. He stood on the street looking around, and the old man who played the music followed to find him. The boy turned his head.
0:5:37|0:5:46|The boy stared at him quietly without moving. After speaking, the old man turned and walked away. The boy stared at the old man's back, feeling a bit confused.
0:5:54|0:6:1|The onlookers threw their tips on the ground, and a young boy waiting on the side quickly picked them up and handed them to the slowly sitting down Gao Fengshan.
0:6:3|0:6:12|[Gao Fengshan] took the money, glanced around, and stood up with the support of the nearby stall. The boy hurried forward to help.
0:6:17|0:6:19|After speaking, the young boy plucked up the courage to dust off the dirt on [Gao Fengshan]. The young boy stopped his actions.
0:7:14|0:7:17|The inn owner stood up and walked towards the boiling kettle to add water for himself.
0:7:45|0:7:52|[Gao Fengshan] leads the young boy into the room. [Gao Fengshan] looks at the boy and asks him something in a low voice.
0:8:5|0:8:7|The woman covered her nose, her face full of disgust.
0:10:20|0:10:29|And so, the young boy found a place to rest. He squatted in the courtyard, holding a basin of water, and splashed it on the ground with his hand. The inn owner approached him with a water pitcher.
0:10:58|0:11:4|The young boy stood up, wiped the sweat off his forehead, and placed the pieces of coal on the ground into the pot.
0:11:28|0:11:37|The little boy's body stood in front of the water pump so thin, he struggled to press the water pump, and a hint of emotion appeared on [Gao Fengshan]'s calm face.
0:11:42|0:11:58|The young boy walked into the room with a bowl in his hands, carefully placing the medicine on the table. [Gao Fengshan] sat at the table with a shirt on, and the boy, not idle, took a basin from under the bed and left the room. [Gao Fengshan] shifted the medicine bowl and looked at him, then shortly after, the boy returned with clean water for washing the face.
0:11:59|0:12:17|[Gao Fengshan] picked up the medicine on the table and slowly drank it, the bitter Chinese medicine made [Gao Fengshan] frown. He put down the bowl and looked at the boy who was making the bed. "I say, [Wang Yuzhen], put down your work and go to the master," she said, her eyes full of longing as she looked at the master.
0:12:40|0:12:45|As soon as the words fell, the gentleman raised his hand and pointed outside the door, indicating Wang Yuzhen to leave.
0:13:20|0:13:23|He placed the breakfast on the table. On the street, a [Bald Man] with a piece of grass in his mouth was wandering around.
0:13:36|0:13:46|Before the fight started, a coin fell to the ground with a clink, catching the attention of [the man with a crew cut]. [Gao Fengshan] had just covered it with his hand when it was stepped on by a foot, and [the man with a crew cut] picked up the coin.
0:13:53|0:14:5|[Gao Fengshan] jumps onto the back of the man with a crew cut. The man with a crew cut grabs [Gao Fengshan] from behind, pins him to the ground, and tries to hit him with his hand, but is flipped over onto a nearby stall by a boy standing by.
0:14:27|0:14:36|The gentleman pushed away [the crew-cut man] and then took [Gao Fengshan] to pack up. Below the city wall, the overpass was still bustling. The brother and [Gao Fengshan] stood under the shade of a tree.
0:14:38|0:14:43|[Gao Fengshan] took the yellow-faced nanny from his brother's hand and gobbled it up, then suddenly stopped.
0:14:58|0:15:0|[Gao Fengshan] hesitated upon hearing the news.
0:15:49|0:16:5|Fengshan listened to Gao Fengshan's fast-paced storytelling, unable to help but be fascinated, staring in awe at the artistic charm of the storytelling. Gao Fengshan performed his storytelling skillfully, with the surrounding audience fully engaged, creating a lively storytelling atmosphere, a true expression of love for the art. Standing on the side, Gao Fengshan couldn't help but reach out to touch the storytelling board.
0:17:2|0:17:4|Madam Shi swayed as she walked out of the room.
0:17:24|0:17:44|Madam Shifu shook her head and walked away. Mr. Cao stared at Fengshan with a serious expression, and Fengshan slowly stood up from the washbasin. Following Mr. Cao into the room, he took a fan from behind his neck and placed it on the table, sitting on a stool and looking at Fengshan in front of him. The slender Fengshan appeared somewhat uneasy facing Mr. Cao.
0:17:54|0:18:11|Madam raised her hand to stop Sir, who put down the fan in his hand. Madam gave a disdainful look to Fengshan, then turned around to fetch the clappers on the table. Fengshan looked nervously at Sir. Madam handed them to [Gao Fengshan].
0:18:20|0:18:28|I arrived, [Gao Fengshan] pursed his lips, the master stared expressionlessly, not allowing [Gao Fengshan] to deceive his belief in fast-paced rhythm.
0:18:46|0:19:0|The gentleman tapped the chopsticks with a fan, and [Gao Fengshan] hurriedly knelt down in tears. With a sorrowful face, [Gao Fengshan] was pulled up by the teacher when she saw the situation.
0:19:11|0:19:19|Upon hearing the words of the teacher, Mr. [Gao Fengshan] looked up with a pensive expression. [Gao Fengshan] knelt on the ground, kowtowing to pay respect to the teacher, tears rolling down his cheeks.
0:19:49|0:20:1|The gentleman bowed to the audience around him in gratitude. He took a step back with a limp, leaning against a nearby table and sitting on the ground. [Gao Fengshan] carefully counted the money on the ground. A spectator raised his hand holding the money, looking at [Gao Fengshan].
0:20:1|0:20:9|[Gao Fengshan] glanced at the master, walked towards the audience, and picked up the fallen money with both hands. Holding the money, he turned and walked towards [Cao DeKui].
0:20:20|0:20:27|[Cao DeKui] slapped the palm of [Gao Fengshan], then slowly stood up, bowing his head to look at [Gao Fengshan], who was enduring the intense pain in his hand.
0:20:51|0:21:6|[Cao DeKui] gritted his teeth, looking serious. For him, rules were sacred. Back at home, a worn-out bowl was filled with dark medicine. [Cao DeKui] picked up the bowl from the table, but hesitated. The next moment, he placed the bowl back on the table. Pointing at his leg, he looked up at [Gao Fengshan].
0:21:46|0:21:53|Upon hearing Cao DeKui's words, Gao Fengshan was overjoyed and hurried to the cabinet to take out chopsticks and a plate. Mr. Ma played with the fan in his hand, waiting for Gao Fengshan.
0:22:34|0:22:51|Mr. scolded Gao Fengshan, who was not attentive, the moon hung high in the sky in the quiet night. Mr. carried an oil lamp and carefully entered the room to check on the already sleeping Gao Fengshan. He placed a water jug by the bed, and Gao Fengshan on the bed was already fast asleep, with traces of blood at the corner of his mouth from Mr.'s scolding.
0:22:51|0:22:58|The gentleman placed the oil lamp by the bedside, then reached into his jacket pocket and took out a box of matches, holding it in his hand.
0:22:59|0:23:15|Adjusting the coat on his shoulders, he took out a match and struck it gently. The flickering flame danced in the night until it ignited the wick of the oil lamp, illuminating the dim room. At this moment, Mr. Gao's gentleness was completely different from his sternness during the day; this was just his dedication to the art of fast-paced storytelling.
0:23:16|0:23:30|No one can be perfunctory in his faith. Lighting the oil lamp, he blew out the match in his hand and put the matchbox back into his pocket. He gently took off the towel draped over his shoulder, picked up a basin of water, and poured it onto the towel.
0:23:30|0:23:37|The dry towel was wetted, and he turned his head to Gao Fengshan, holding the towel to examine the wounds and bloodstains at the corner of Gao Fengshan's mouth.
0:23:39|0:23:52|Gently wiping the corners of his mouth, his movements were gentle yet firm. At this moment, as Madam walked into Gao Fengshan's room wearing a coat, she watched Mr. attending to Gao Fengshan's wound, reaching out to pat Mr.'s head.
0:23:54|0:24:6|Mr. Gao Fengshan gestured for the teacher not to make a sound, picked up the water bottle next to him, and handed it to her. The teacher took the water bottle with a worried look on her face, and Mr. Gao Fengshan slowly turned around, blowing out the oil lamp on the bedside.
0:24:6|0:24:19|The bright room once again fell into darkness, as Mr. Gao slowly picked up the oil lamp by the bedside, instructing the inn owner to leave the room together. Their figures gradually disappeared outside the door, while Fengshan on the bed had already woken up.
0:25:3|0:25:8|The man at the village entrance took the grass out of the bird's mouth and bent down to the stone pagoda to collect money.
0:25:53|0:26:4|The area was crowded with people enjoying the spectacle. The crew-cut man who had tripped over still refused to pay, he got up from the ground and stood there nonchalantly.
0:26:4|0:26:22|The crew-cut man took a step forward, hesitated to speak, looked at the crowd around him, spat provocatively at the ground, turned to leave, but was stopped by the onlookers. He raised his hand to adjust his clothes and walked out of the crowd with a look of arrogance.
0:26:24|0:26:28|The onlookers gradually dispersed, and in the early morning, Gao Fengshan walked into the master's room.
0:26:54|0:27:13|After speaking, the gentleman lay back on the bed. [Gao Fengshan] walked to the wall and took down the hanging clothes. The bustling noise from the sky bridge continued, with the sound of drumming echoing in the ears. [Gao Fengshan] knelt alone on the ground, tapping the drum board in his hand. Seeing no onlookers around, he put away the drum board and placed it in a nearby bag.
0:27:13|0:27:23|Raising his head to the scorching sun in the sky, he slowly stood up, supporting his knees. Bending over, he rubbed his knees on the ground with both hands. [Gao Fengshan] walked over when he saw this.
0:28:3|0:28:12|After speaking, [Master Shen] turned and left, while [Gao Fengshan] walked over from a distance holding a jar.
0:28:25|0:28:30|The brother opened his shirt pocket to show Gao Fengshan, leaning forward and whispering in his ear.
0:28:32|0:28:40|The two brothers hurriedly left with the jar and sat in the alley. [Gao Fengshan] turned the jar upside down on the steps.
0:28:42|0:28:49|[Gao Fengshan] hurriedly got up in response, his brother turned his head and watched [Gao Fengshan] walk away. Before long, [Gao Fengshan] returned with a stone in hand.
0:29:34|0:29:38|[Gao Fengshan] handed the tobacco to the crew-cut man, who took it and sniffed it.
0:29:42|0:30:0|The brother took out a rolling paper from his pocket, and the man with a crew cut stared at the rolling paper in his brother's hand, eagerly snatching it away. He licked the edge of the rolling paper, tore off a piece, and then placed the cigarette in his mouth. He took out a match, struck it, and lit the cigarette in his mouth.
0:30:0|0:30:9|The older brother stared intently at the cigarette in the bald man's hand. As the cigarette was lit, the bald man took a deep drag, exhaled the smoke stylishly, and smiled with a look of surprise.
0:30:47|0:31:11|The crew-cut man went to get the whip for [Gao Fengshan] again, his expression changed drastically as he listened to the fast-paced rhythm. Just as the fast-paced rhythm described, the crew-cut man acted exactly as instructed, leaning against the table with his hands on his waist, then he clutched his stomach and fled.
0:31:46|0:32:2|Say it, brother, carry your luggage and embark on a distant journey. [Gao Fengshan] smiled, watching his brother's departing figure. After taking two steps, she turned back to look at [Gao Fengshan]. [Gao Fengshan] and his brother waved goodbye to each other. The reluctant brother turned his head and walked towards the distance.
0:32:2|0:32:7|Gao Fengshan took two steps lightly, then turned back again. Taking three steps and turning back, it showed the reluctance of the older brother towards the younger brother.
0:32:8|0:32:29|[Gao Fengshan]'s raised corners of the mouth gradually dropped, and this time his brother who turned and left never looked back, disappearing from sight with slow steps. On the bridge, many spectators around [Gao Fengshan] clapped and cheered, while [Cao DeKui] and the storyteller assisted on the side, watching [Gao Fengshan]'s performance.
0:33:11|0:33:21|[Cao DeKui] walked towards the crowd with a fan in his hand, interrupting [Gao Fengshan] who was playing the game of kicking the shuttlecock. Seeing [Cao DeKui] stop his activity, [Gao Fengshan] gave him a deep and meaningful look.
0:33:34|0:33:46|[Gao Fengshan] didn't listen to [Cao DeKui] and started tapping the board again. [Cao DeKui] glanced at the crowd, said nothing, and then turned and left. Inside the room, Lion Bird was cleaning the room with a golden-haired courage.
0:35:25|0:35:41|[Gao Fengshan] had a face full of grievances, but without saying a word, he knelt on the ground. Although kneeling, he still kept his back straight, looking faithfully at his master in front of him. [Cao DeKui] still had anger on his face, he turned his face away and refused to look at the kneeling [Gao Fengshan].
0:35:41|0:35:53|As the words fell, Gao Fengshan did not get up. Seeing this, Cao DeKui picked up the chicken feather duster on the table. Gao Fengshan hurriedly got up and walked towards the door. Cao DeKui slammed the chicken feather duster heavily on the table, causing the maid beside him to tremble in fear.
0:36:10|0:36:18|[Cao DeKui] finished speaking and walked towards the overpass. The storyteller smiled and looked at [Cao DeKui]'s back, as [Cao DeKui] started to perform a fast-paced routine alone under the overpass.
0:36:19|0:36:23|[Cao DeKui] looked around and saw that there were no audience, so he stopped the fast-paced rhythm in his hands.
0:37:18|0:37:32|The old man glanced at [Gao Fengshan] with his head tilted, then left without any hesitation. [Gao Fengshan] stood there looking puzzled, but after a moment of thought, he became even more resentful, with the tools for fast-paced performance still lying quietly on the ground.
0:37:34|0:37:36|Gao Fengshan walked out from the main gate.
0:38:39|0:38:55|Fengshan took a step back, bowed deeply to [Gao Fengshan], who lowered his head with a serious expression, looking at Fengshan. Fengshan slowly straightened up and raised her head, while [Gao Fengshan] looked at her without saying a word. Fengshan walked away with the package, but her gaze still lingered on [Gao Fengshan] at the door.
0:38:55|0:38:59|He took three steps and looked back, silently expressing his reluctance in his heart.
0:39:4|0:39:22|Turning around again, the young Fengshan has grown into a tall and strong young adult. She slowly walks out of the alley, ready to embark on a new journey in life. In the lawless area of Tianjin, everyone on the street is hustling for a living. A ragged young man staggers down the street carrying a bundle.
0:39:22|0:39:30|He swayed and staggered, quickly grabbing onto the window frame by the road. A sudden sense of weakness came over him, and he collapsed by the window, unconscious.
0:39:31|0:39:44|Two passersby watched as he collapsed on the ground, and soon a crowd gathered around him. The two men squatted down, supporting his head and examining his face with a look of surprise.
0:39:49|0:39:52|The two brothers carried the unconscious Gao Fengshan into the room and slowly walked towards the house.
0:40:18|0:40:40|The landlady brought two men to put the benches in front of the table together, and the two elder brothers lifted Gao Fengshan and placed him on the bench. The landlady sighed as she supported her waist, everyone looked at the unconscious Gao Fengshan, and placed the porridge brought over by the side of Gao Fengshan's mouth, using a spoon to feed him.
0:40:43|0:40:57|The landlady took the porridge bowl, picked up the spoon, and slowly brought it to the lips of [Gao Fengshan]. The elder brother beside her held [Gao Fengshan]'s mouth with both hands, trying to get him to open it. The porridge slowly poured into [Gao Fengshan]'s stomach, but half of it spilled out of the corner of his mouth.
0:41:1|0:41:5|Gao Fengshan, who was in a coma, slowly regained consciousness, and the surrounding people who were on guard felt relieved.
0:41:40|0:41:44|Three people supported [Gao Fengshan], helping him sit up straight, while the grandmother reached out and pounded his waist.
0:42:5|0:42:9|[Gao Fengshan] slowly turned his head and looked at his senior brother beside him.
0:44:29|0:44:37|[Gao Fengshan] sat in the room with a solemn expression, holding a pair of clappers in his hands and occasionally stroking them. Holding the clappers, he evoked memories of [Gao Fengshan]'s childhood.
0:45:45|0:45:48|Senior Brother and [Gao Fengshan] approached each other, their shoulders touching.
0:46:42|0:46:56|Night falls, at the mansion's grand banquet, the audience below is packed, the scene is lively. The maids in the mansion are serving dishes in an orderly manner, earnestly entertaining the guests. The performers, dressed in cheongsam, stand elegantly on the stage.
0:46:56|0:47:12|With Tianjin drumsticks in hand, he spoke with authority and clarity, showcasing his profound skills. The guests below enjoyed the music, contrasting sharply with the common people making a living. [Gao Fengshan] sat with his senior brother in the room, having a meal.
0:49:22|0:49:35|Butler Wan tilted his head back and left the room with his wife, as the smile on Gao Fengshan's face gradually disappeared.
0:50:9|0:50:32|At this moment, the atmosphere in the examination courtyard remains lively, with guests dressed in their finest attire. On the stage, Gao Fengshan performs with great emotion and eloquence, sometimes passionate and intense, sometimes speaking softly and tenderly. With his left hand on the board and his right hand on the drum, he creates a mesmerizing performance, swaying gracefully with a charming demeanor in his every movement.
0:51:37|0:51:53|The oldest [Gao Fengshan] staggered towards the table opposite, swaying every two steps and finally collapsed onto a nearby chair. As the performance on stage came to an end, he continuously moved his hands and changed postures, captivating the audience below with the brilliant show.
0:51:53|0:52:8|The audience kept applauding, which was a great affirmation of his performance. Two spectators in the audience were enjoying the show, raising their thumbs in appreciation. Encouraged by this, he performed even more energetically. After a final song, the curtain fell.
0:52:23|0:52:30|Butler Wan walked up to Gao Fengshan, took a look at him, and found that Gao Fengshan was already drunk and fast asleep, with drool coming out of his mouth.
0:53:5|0:53:15|On the side, a servant with a teapot poured water onto Gao Fengshan's head. Butler Wan walked towards the drunken Gao Fengshan and pulled him up by the collar.
0:53:37|0:53:42|[Butler Wan] glared angrily, while his senior brother knelt on the ground pleading.
0:54:1|0:54:8|Senior Brother grabbed the servant, but was kicked to the ground by the servant. The servant hit the wall and he painfully straightened up, holding his waist.
0:54:16|0:54:25|[Butler Wan] had a smile on his face, but it sent chills down people's spines. Watching the drunken [Gao Fengshan], he suddenly pulled out a handgun from his pocket.
0:55:2|0:55:8|On the side, Gao Fengshan was still sound asleep, and the smile on Butler Wan's face immediately disappeared.
0:55:13|0:55:25|[Butler Wan] put away the gun in his hand, pointed at his senior brother, and the senior brother kneeling on the ground slowly stood up. [Butler Wan] grabbed a wooden board from the nearby cabinet and slammed it heavily into the senior brother's hand. The senior brother turned around in fear and walked away slowly.
0:55:25|0:55:32|Butler Wan lifted his foot and kicked towards his senior brother. In the blink of an eye, the performance ended, and his senior brother carried Gao Fengshan back to the Grandmother's Hall.
0:55:36|0:55:41|The waiter went up to help support him, while senior brother, panting, sat [Gao Fengshan] on a chair.
0:56:25|0:56:39|Gao Fengshan's drunken appearance infuriated Lady Cui, and the Inn Owner walked over with a basin. He glanced at Lady Cui and splashed water on Gao Fengshan's face without saying a word. The drunken Gao Fengshan slowly woke up, while Lady Cui stared at him angrily.
0:56:39|0:56:49|Upon waking up, Fengshan rubbed his eyes with his sleeve, struggled to push himself up from the chair, and looked at Lady Cui with a fearful expression. He then glanced silently at his senior brother beside him.
0:56:51|0:56:54|Lady Cui slammed the table and said that integrity was being compromised, making Gao Fengshan hang his head in shame.
0:57:52|0:57:54|Gao Fengshan appears lost in thought.
0:57:59|0:58:5|[Gao Fengshan] nodded and pushed open the room door, closing it behind him.
0:58:41|0:58:46|Master Shen was very pleased with Gao Fengshan's attitude, he picked up the wine glass and poured it full.
0:58:51|0:59:1|[Gao Fengshan] walked to the table with a smile on his face. The two masters watched his back as he carried a cup of tea filled with water and approached them.
0:59:19|0:59:35|[Gao Fengshan] looked at the two masters with a smile on his face. Qin master spoke first, and Master Shen looked at Qin master helplessly. The two masters raised their wine glasses towards [Gao Fengshan], who drank the tea in his hand without hesitation.
0:59:41|0:59:58|The performance was proceeding peacefully, but as time passed, the world was no longer calm. The invaders' warplanes attacked the land of China, and the Marco Polo Bridge Incident erupted, leading to the country's destruction and countless families being torn apart. The atmosphere in the mansion of Lady Cui was no longer bustling, with everyone sitting in chairs dozing off.
1:1:1|1:1:10|[Gao Fengshan] traveled day and night to return to Beiping, holding medicine in his hands as he stood in front of his master's house. Looking at the master's gate, it seemed as if the moment of departure was still vivid in his mind.
1:2:53|1:3:11|[Gao Fengshan] angrily watched the shopkeeper, who hurriedly turned and left. Just as he ran out the door, he took a big tumble. He picked up his glasses from the ground, put them back on, and used his hands to prop himself up, struggling to get up. He brushed off the dirt on his body with his hands and looked around.
1:3:17|1:3:22|Shortly afterwards, [Gao Fengshan] gently closed the door of the room and took out money from his pocket to hand it to the doctor.
1:3:45|1:3:55|[Gao Fengshan] pursed his lips, looking worried, and raised his hand to see off the doctor. The [Gao Fengshan] outside the door knew well that he couldn't resist the cycle of life and death in the world.
1:5:33|1:5:50|Master lay on the bed, weak as a thread, looking at [Gao Fengshan] in front of him. [Gao Fengshan] had a pained and reluctant expression, picking up the clapperboard on the table, sorrow lingering in his heart. The clapperboard in his hand sounded, the best medicine for Master, but still unable to turn back time.
1:6:17|1:6:30|Accompanied by the fast-paced rhythm, the master closed his eyes and leaned weakly against the bed, tears streaming down the corners of [Gao Fengshan]'s eyes, realizing the great kindness his mentor had shown him, a debt that could never be repaid by anyone.
1:6:30|1:6:45|Paper money is scattered in the sky, [Gao Fengshan] walks alone on the path pulling his master's coffin fruit. As he walks, he scatters the paper money, showing his final filial piety to his master. The drifting paper money signifies that [Gao Fengshan] has no more family in this world.
1:6:47|1:7:9|As the night grew darker, [Gao Fengshan] tossed and turned in bed, constantly disturbed by dreams. The figures of his brother and master kept appearing, vividly reminding him of his past downfall.
1:7:15|1:7:21|In his dream, [Master Shen] performed with him, but at this moment he suddenly woke up and sat up.
1:7:43|1:7:47|The man with the drill took the tip money while no one was paying attention.
1:8:30|1:8:39|At the village entrance, the man listened to the fast-paced rhythm, his expression lost in thought. The second senior brother looked at the dispersing audience around him, and [Gao Fengshan] shook his head and sighed.
1:9:2|1:9:13|The rice in this bowl is steaming, the boys in the courtyard are playing happily, while the mother is picking vegetables on the side, [Gao Fengshan] and his martial brothers are performing on the street, with large knots the size of copper coins on their necks.
1:9:53|1:10:7|Hearing the noise outside the door, the woman got up and walked to the door, opening it. The senior brothers placed the medicine in their hands on the table and sat down.
1:11:12|1:11:29|[Cao's Wife] saw a bag on the ground. Senior Brother quickly raised his hand to stop her from making a sound. [Gao Fengshan] heard the movement and looked towards the door with difficulty. Days passed like this. [Gao Fengshan]'s wife squatted on the kitchen floor, scooping rice from the rice jar.
1:11:29|1:11:32|A ladle scooped out, but only poured out a little, placed in a basin on the side.
1:11:33|1:11:44|He looked at the basin, then at the rice jar, lifted the basin with a few grains of rice back into the jar, and lifted the lid of another jar. His son bit his finger and watched his mother quietly.
1:11:44|1:11:55|[Gao Fengshan] threw the ladle in her hand into the jar, covered it, then approached a nearby bamboo basket, took out the potatoes from the basket, and then dug out a carrot, looking at the vegetables in her hand lost in thought.
1:11:56|1:12:15|By the small river, overgrown with weeds and scattered with dead branches and leaves. The water in the river ripples in circles, [Gao Fengshan] walks along the path by the river in thin clothing. The surroundings are extremely quiet, [Gao Fengshan] has a calm expression, looking somewhat despondent as he gazes at the small river in front of him, lost in thought.
1:12:15|1:12:20|After the calm, there was a flurry of battle, with shells landing and fireworks shooting into the sky.
1:12:21|1:12:35|In the midst of the gunfire, everything turned to ashes and smoke, as the soldiers charged into battle to defend their homeland. After the war, with the country now at peace, the doctor was making the final bandages for [Gao Fengshan] lying in bed.
1:12:47|1:12:52|The chief surgeon looked at the still unconscious Gao Fengshan, as if he had discovered something.
1:15:36|1:15:41|It was late at night, [Cao's Wife] stepped forward and snatched the pen from [Gao Fengshan]'s hand. [Gao Fengshan] took back his pen.
1:16:13|1:16:16|[Cao's Wife] leaned in for a closer look.
1:17:2|1:17:22|[Cao's Wife] left, the room was decorated with lanterns and streamers, a new scene was holding the door sign, [Gao Fengshan] and his fellow apprentices walked out from the door in Zhongshan suits, [Gao Fengshan] and his fellow apprentices greeted guests from all directions, sat at the table at the door and chatted with everyone, firecrackers were already neatly arranged, and they lit the firecrackers with matches.
1:17:22|1:17:28|With the crackling sound, fireworks shot up into the sky, symbolizing a new beginning.
1:17:37|1:17:44|He looked up and saw [Gao Fengshan] with a shocked expression. He was the bald man who had been asking for tea repeatedly.
1:18:1|1:18:9|The guests stood up to congratulate Gao Fengshan as he stood in the room performing a fast-paced rhythm, with a strong young man standing behind him.
1:18:51|1:19:7|The skinny disciple quickly picked up the clapper on the table and stood in front of [Gao Fengshan]. [Gao Fengshan] also picked up the chicken feather duster on the table, the clapper sounded, and the disciple entered a state. [Gao Fengshan] looked at the disciple in front of him with a serious expression, listening to the skinny disciple's clapper with a slight frown.
1:19:8|1:19:18|[Gao Fengshan] turned around and reached out with a chicken feather duster to sweep upwards. He sighed, returned to the table and sat down, patting the feather duster on the table, glancing at the two disciples in front of him.
1:19:43|1:19:46|The skinny disciple placed the clappers back on the table.
1:19:51|1:20:1|The skinny disciple hesitated for a moment, reached out to gather the clothes and stuffed them into his pants, then adjusted the elastic band on his pants. After tidying up, he glanced at [Gao Fengshan] in front of him.
1:20:13|1:20:38|The skinny disciple was a bit at a loss and walked out the door. The other chubby disciple looked cautiously at [Gao Fengshan]. The scolded chubby disciple became even more uneasy, [Gao Fengshan] glanced at the chubby disciple beside him. Just as the chubby disciple was about to leave, the skinny disciple walked in, placed the bug on the table, and wiped the sweat off his forehead with his sleeve.
1:20:40|1:20:57|He smiled foolishly, looking at [Gao Fengshan]. [Gao Fengshan] picked up the bug on the table and placed it in his palm. Standing up, [Gao Fengshan] waved at him. He looked at the bug in his hand without saying a word.
1:21:0|1:21:19|The skinny disciple couldn't stop shaking his body, [Gao Fengshan] raised an eyebrow at the chubby disciple. As the chubby disciple reached out to pull out bugs from his clothes, he gasped for breath, looking at [Gao Fengshan] with a face full of fear. [Gao Fengshan] raised his hand to signal the skinny disciple, who then reached behind to scratch.
1:21:34|1:21:43|[Gao Fengshan] looked at him helplessly, and in the blink of an eye, some time had passed. [Gao Fengshan] sat at the table with his martial brothers.
1:22:9|1:22:18|As soon as the words fell, Xiao Li followed Xizi out of the room. The senior brothers took Xiao Li away from Gao Fengshan's house.
1:22:27|1:22:46|After speaking, the senior brother turned and left. Xiao Li lowered his head and quietly looked at the money in his hand. In the courtyard, a ceremony was being held to pay respects to the master. [Gao Fengshan] and his wife stood at the forefront, bowing deeply to the master's portrait, then turned back to their positions.
1:22:49|1:23:5|Xiao Li stood up and walked towards [Gao Fengshan] and his wife. [Gao Fengshan] and his wife were sitting in their seats, with serious expressions on their faces.
1:23:30|1:23:37|The child picked up the clapperboard on the table, only to be severely reprimanded. [Gao Fengshan] turned around and sat back in his chair, saying sternly.
1:23:39|1:23:45|One hand tapping on the table, [Gao Fengshan] stared at it, gradually getting lost in thought.
1:23:53|1:23:59|In the scene where his brother performs fast-paced storytelling, [Gao Fengshan] admires him vividly. His wife walks up to him with a teapot and watches him.
1:24:4|1:24:8|[Gao Fengshan] weakly leaned back in the chair and slowly closed his eyes.
1:24:36|1:24:55|[Gao Fengshan] turned his head to one side, tears streaked down his face, his brother's disappearance was a forbidden area in his heart. After countless days and nights, [Gao Fengshan] pushed his bicycle into the courtyard, looking at his wife and children, his wife sitting in the center of the courtyard washing clothes.
1:24:55|1:25:1|[Gao Fengshan] walked towards the center of the courtyard, next to his wife, a smile uncontrollably appearing on his face.
1:26:15|1:26:21|Accompanied by the applause of the audience, [Gao Fengshan] stepped onto the stage and walked to the center, with the clappers in his hands starting to sound.
1:26:31|1:26:50|[Gao Fengshan] sat in the sedan chair. Now, [Gao Fengshan] had nothing more to say, just looking out the window. Passing by was the former residence of his master.
1:26:57|1:27:3|The only scenes flashing through Gao Fengshan's mind, he sighed, closed his eyes, and shook his head.
1:27:46|1:27:53|[Gao Fengshan] and the third senior brother walked out of the gate together, the senior brother turned back and sighed as he looked at [Gao Fengshan].
1:29:56|1:29:59|Suddenly opened his eyes and looked out the window.
1:30:5|1:30:9|[Gao Fengshan] walked aimlessly with a small teapot in his hands.
