0:1:4|0:1:26|On the eve of the 2007 Chinese New Year, the train station was packed with people of all kinds bustling on the platform. As the train arrived, everyone rushed forward with their luggage in tow. The train attendants stood straight at the door, staring intently at each passenger boarding the train. Inside the carriage, it was very crowded.
0:1:26|0:1:44|The person who came up front was busy putting away luggage, while the person at the back was struggling to find a seat while dragging their luggage. For a moment, the carriage was filled with the cries of children and the noisy chatter of people. Some stood on chairs to place their luggage, while others held their tickets in hand searching for their seats. Some early arrivals were already sitting in their seats, dozing off.
0:1:44|0:1:58|Not far away, the voice of the steward brother woke up the sleeping passengers, urging everyone to check their tickets. Passengers took out their tickets one after another to cooperate with the inspection, [Fang Xiaoxiao], with short hair, anxiously searched for something next to her seat.
0:2:27|0:2:38|[Lin Jianqing], wearing a hoodie and black-framed glasses, stood behind [Fang Xiaoxiao], shaking the ticket in his hand. His delicate face revealed a hint of shyness, and his eyes looked at [Fang Xiaoxiao] with a gentle smile.
0:2:38|0:2:52|Fang Xiaoxiao sees Lin Jianqing as if seeing a savior, her eyes full of gratitude and curiosity, nodding eagerly at him. The scene shifts to 11 years later, on the eve of the Spring Festival in 2018, Lin Jianqing has just boarded the plane.
0:2:53|0:3:9|[Lin Jianqing] lifted the suitcase and placed it on the luggage rack. A passerby accidentally bumped into him from behind and gestured an apology. [Lin Jianqing] turned around to respond, only to see a familiar figure, [Fang Xiaoxiao]. The flight attendant stood by, smiling and directing everyone to sit down.
0:3:14|0:3:33|Shortly after, [Lin Jianqing] sat in his seat wearing a Bluetooth earphone, staring blankly ahead. [Fang Xiaoxiao] slowly peeked out from the seat behind him, secretly observing him. His eyes revealed a long-lost joy, yet also couldn't hide the loneliness, as [Lin Jianqing] hung his head in dejection.
0:3:33|0:3:47|After a long silence, Lin Jianqing couldn't help but turn his head and look back. Fang Xiaoxiao had already sat back in her seat, and Lin Jianqing did not see her. He tried hard to find her position, and Fang Xiaoxiao seemed to feel Lin Jianqing's gaze as he leaned out of his seat.
0:3:47|0:4:0|[Lin Jianqing] couldn't hide his joy in his eyes, and [Fang Xiaoxiao] gave him a slight smile. Ten years later, the two met again, but they were already the most familiar strangers.
0:4:44|0:4:54|The train was moving forward in the icy snow, and at that moment, Lin Jianqing and Fang Xiaoxiao met on the train and hit it off immediately. The two quickly became acquainted.
0:5:2|0:5:8|Two people were leaning against the window, looking at the scenery outside, when suddenly the train began to slow down. Before long, it came to a stop.
0:5:17|0:5:34|Due to the weather, the train was forced to stop, and everyone had to sit on the train and wait. [Lin Jianqing] was sleeping soundly with his head down. Feeling bored, [Fang Xiaoxiao] was passing the time by reading a newspaper. She put down the newspaper and glanced at [Lin Jianqing], then turned to look out the window. Suddenly, her eyes lit up.
0:5:34|0:5:47|She held her breath and shook [Lin Jianqing] awake. [Lin Jianqing] opened her eyes groggily and looked in the direction pointed by [Fang Xiaoxiao], suddenly widening her eyes. A pair of antlers appeared in the snowy field, followed by a slowly emerging head.
0:5:47|0:6:2|The two looked at the sudden appearance of the little deer, their faces showing a delighted smile. The deer frolicked in the snow, completely unaware that it had caught the attention of the two people in the train. As they watched, they suddenly turned their heads to look at each other simultaneously.
0:6:2|0:6:10|[Fang Xiaoxiao] signaled to [Lin Jianqing] to get off the car. [Lin Jianqing] hesitated, looking around, but eventually got off the car under [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s insistence.
0:6:12|0:6:18|Zheng Huan and Chen Dewen also got off the car shortly after.
0:7:24|0:7:30|[Lin Jianqing] held one end of the scarf, while the other end was held by [Fang Xiaoxiao], and the two of them walked back laughing.
0:7:50|0:8:2|[Lin Jianqing] reached out and grabbed [Fang Xiaoxiao] who was passing by. [Fang Xiaoxiao] smiled at him and didn't refuse. Familiarly, [Lin Jianqing] carried [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s luggage and the two of them got off the plane one after the other.
0:8:28|0:8:40|Behind them, [Fang Xiaoxiao] hurriedly took his ticket and they turned to leave. Despite their reluctance, they ended up in the same hotel room, pushing their luggage in. To their surprise, there was only one bed inside.
0:8:52|0:9:2|[Fang Xiaoxiao] turned back, glanced at [Lin Jianqing], and closed the door. With one hand dragging her luggage, she stood in place looking at [Lin Jianqing]. [Lin Jianqing] stood by the window watching [Fang Xiaoxiao].
0:9:23|0:9:28|The two were searching for a topic, but the atmosphere remained very tense. After a long time, [Lin Jianqing] spoke up.
0:9:30|0:9:41|[Lin Jianqing] finished speaking and then lowered his head in silence, as if it wasn't a question at all. He looked much older, with a few strands of white hair on his head. [Fang Xiaoxiao] didn't answer him, just sat slowly on the edge of the bed in silence.
0:10:8|0:10:18|The scene shifts back 11 years ago, [Fang Xiaoxiao] returned to her hometown and greeted the neighbors before hurrying back home and closing the door.
0:10:33|0:10:40|[Fang Xiaoxiao] hadn't even had time to put down her backpack before skillfully fixing the old light bulb in the room. After tidying up, she sat in a chair lost in thought.
0:10:40|0:11:6|The furniture in the room has become old and dusty, the walls are also worn out. She took out the chocolate sent by her mother, glanced at the portrait of her father on the wall, blew off the dust on the table, placed a piece of peeled chocolate on it, then took out another piece, pulled out the card from the wrapper and placed it on the table. She then broke the chocolate in her hand, picked up one piece and put it in her mouth, chewing and savoring the taste of chocolate, revealing a happy smile.
0:11:6|0:11:14|[Lin Jianqing] also returned home, where his father was busy in the kitchen preparing the New Year's Eve dinner. [Lin Jianqing] walked in with a bowl in his hands.
0:11:26|0:11:32|[Lin's Father] lifted the lid of the steamer next to him, revealing steaming hot sticky rice dumplings inside.
0:12:9|0:12:22|[Lin Jianqing] ignored [Lin's Father]'s insults, walked straight to the door, and looked outside through the glass on the door, only to see [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s figure. [Fang Xiaoxiao] was wearing a knitted hat, a fitted long cotton coat, and was setting off firecrackers with two children in the snow.
0:12:22|0:12:30|[Lin Jianqing] looked up, smiled, pushed the door open and walked out. He stood at the doorway, smiling foolishly at [Fang Xiaoxiao], with a sign above his head that read "Lin's Family Restaurant".
0:12:32|0:12:41|[Fang Xiaoxiao] held a few just lit sparklers in her hand, looked back at [Lin Jianqing], who extinguished the cigarette in his hand and threw it on the ground, and the two walked towards each other.
0:12:44|0:12:49|[Fang Xiaoxiao] was wearing a pair of high-heeled shoes, and as soon as she finished speaking, she stumbled and almost slipped.
0:13:59|0:14:12|After finishing the New Year's Eve dinner, it was already pitch black outside, with only the lantern in front of the door emitting a festive glow. [Lin Jianqing] and [Fang Xiaoxiao] pushed open the door and walked out.
0:14:42|0:14:55|She glanced at [Lin Jianqing], and the two of them burst into laughter. Old Lin was alone at home, sitting at the dining table watching TV. There was half a bottle of wine on the table, and the room was lit only by a dim desk lamp, emitting a faint light.
0:14:55|0:15:8|Old Lin's Father pressed the button on the remote control, but the long-neglected TV did not respond. He slowly stood up and walked over, knocking on the TV's back.
0:17:32|0:17:43|The scene shifts, [Lin Jianqing], [Zheng Huan], and [Chen Dewen] and their group of buddies are eating skewers at the night market. [Lin Jianqing] turns his head and quickly stands up as he sees [Fang Xiaoxiao] entering with another man.
0:17:43|0:17:52|[Fang Xiaoxiao] pretended not to know them on purpose, pulling the man to sit next to [Lin Jianqing], causing [Lin Jianqing]'s smile to disappear instantly.
0:18:58|0:19:12|[Lin Jianqing] looked displeased, tapping Sun Yilong's glass with a bottle of wine. Sun Yilong frowned and drank it. After dinner, [Lin Jianqing] and [Fang Xiaoxiao] sent the drunken Sun Yilong home. Finally, [Lin Jianqing] couldn't help but ask.
0:19:51|0:20:10|It seemed to be hinting at something, [Fang Xiaoxiao] looked at the serious [Lin Jianqing], not knowing what to say for a moment. She looked ahead for a while, then at [Lin Jianqing]. As if never thought of, [Lin Jianqing] self-deprecatingly smiled, shifted his gaze away. Seeing him distracted, [Fang Xiaoxiao] also laughed.
0:20:59|0:21:4|[Fang Xiaoxiao] finished speaking, with a happy smile on her face, and walked away.
0:21:49|0:21:55|Lin Jianqing, bidding farewell with his good friend Zheng Huan, was interrupted by a phone call from Fang Xiaoxiao. As the scene shifted,
0:21:55|0:22:9|[Lin Jianqing] rode a bicycle with several large bags of luggage behind him, accompanied by [Fang Xiaoxiao]. They stopped in front of a residential building, struggling to unload the luggage from the bike. The two of them then dragged the large bags of luggage into the dilapidated, dirty, and narrow corridor, one in front and one behind.
0:22:9|0:22:25|Upon reaching the elevator, [Lin Jianqing] walked in first, then turned around to wait for [Fang Xiaoxiao]. In the corner of the elevator sat an auntie holding a thermos, giving them a disdainful look as [Fang Xiaoxiao] entered, before closing the elevator door.
0:22:25|0:22:34|Upstairs, in a long corridor, each household is next to each other. Lin Jianqing and Fang Xiaoxiao entered a room, which was divided into many compartments and filled with people.
0:22:39|0:22:54|The two of them struggled to carry their luggage, passing by one room after another. An old man stood at the doorway of a room, curiously watching them. In the next room, a man sat at the computer desk waving enthusiastically to [Fang Xiaoxiao], as [Lin Jianqing] opened the door and the two of them dragged the luggage inside.
0:22:54|0:23:14|In front of the eyes is a small room of less than ten square meters. Under the dim light, there is a cluttered computer desk and a small bed leaning against the wall. [Lin Jianqing] puts the food into the refrigerator in the communal kitchen, then takes out a few bottles of beer. The two of them stand in the room and start drinking.
0:23:16|0:23:32|[Lin Jianqing] turned on the fan in the corner, while [Fang Xiaoxiao] sat silently on the chair next to the computer desk. [Lin Jianqing] leaned back comfortably on the bed, with an expression like a child waiting for praise. He then got up and casually turned on the small night light on the bedside table, smiling at [Fang Xiaoxiao].
0:23:32|0:23:37|[Fang Xiaoxiao] remained silent, with a dejected look and head lowered.
0:23:38|0:23:46|[Lin Jianqing] sat down on the chair and said. [Fang Xiaoxiao] stood up and took off the backpack on her back.
0:24:11|0:24:15|The two of them packed up quietly, with [Lin Jianqing] holding a cigarette ready to light it.
0:24:37|0:24:55|[Fang Xiaoxiao] looked up and saw her tear-streaked face in the mirror. At that moment, a disheveled woman in a bathrobe walked in, holding a can of beer. [Lin Jianqing] stood up nervously. [Fang Xiaoxiao] smiled and stood in front of him.
0:24:59|0:25:9|[Fang Xiaoxiao] leaned against [Lin Jianqing], looking at the woman provocatively. The woman, with wet hair, rolled her eyes at [Fang Xiaoxiao] and turned around to leave.
0:25:18|0:25:32|Before leaving, [Lin Jianqing] couldn't help but give a flirtatious look to Lin. [Lin Jianqing] avoided it with a smile, and after the woman left, they couldn't help but laugh. At night, [Lin Jianqing] made a bed on the floor next to the bed, while [Fang Xiaoxiao] slept on the bed.
0:25:32|0:25:46|In the dimly lit room, only the faint light of the bedside lamp was on. [Lin Jianqing] lay on his side with his back to [Fang Xiaoxiao], flipping through his phone. [Fang Xiaoxiao] wrapped in a blanket, stared at the ceiling in a daze.
0:25:46|0:26:2|At this moment, there was a thought-provoking sound coming from upstairs. [Fang Xiaoxiao] couldn't help but laugh, so [Lin Jianqing] deliberately cleared his throat loudly to avoid embarrassment. [Fang Xiaoxiao] chuckled and playfully kicked [Lin Jianqing]'s butt, causing him to jerk his head around.
0:26:3|0:26:11|[Lin Jianqing] plays a song on his portable music player and hands it to [Fang Xiaoxiao], who puts on the headphones.
0:26:33|0:26:40|[Lin Jianqing] listened and slowly turned towards the bed, moving closer and closer to each other.
0:26:49|0:27:2|With the sound of a toilet flushing, [Lin Jianqing] yawned and pushed open the bathroom door. He walked out and back into the room, closing the door behind him. He stumbled towards the bed, habitually lay down without undressing, and closed his eyes.
0:27:2|0:27:23|[Fang Xiaoxiao] was sleeping soundly with the blanket rolled up on the inner side of the bed. Suddenly, she turned over and lay flat on her back, groggily placing her legs on [Lin Jianqing]'s legs. [Lin Jianqing]'s drowsiness disappeared instantly, his eyes widened in fear of moving, only then realizing he was in the wrong bed. Worried about being discovered, he carefully moved his body, afraid of waking up [Fang Xiaoxiao].
0:27:23|0:27:32|He reached down to the floor with one leg hanging off the bed, then slowly moved downwards, trying hard to pull out the leg and arm that were pinned down by [Fang Xiaoxiao].
0:27:32|0:27:52|Unexpectedly, [Fang Xiaoxiao] made a sudden movement, causing [Lin Jianqing] to immediately stop and hold his breath, observing [Fang Xiaoxiao]. After confirming that everything was fine after a while, he continued to struggle to free his leg, then smoothly rolled onto the nearby floor. He lay on his side of the bed, panting heavily, curled up carefully into a ball, and then pulled the blanket behind him over with his legs.
0:27:52|0:27:57|An unexpected encounter left [Lin Jianqing] unable to calm down for a long time, trying hard to restrain himself.
0:28:36|0:28:43|Chen Dewen stood by the counter with his back to Lin Jianqing, hesitating for a moment before finally speaking.
0:28:44|0:28:52|[Lin Jianqing] remained silent. [Chen Dewen] paused and made up his mind to speak.
0:29:5|0:29:16|[Fang Xiaoxiao] and the male customer appeared on the escalator, chatting animatedly. [Lin Jianqing] stared at the two with a grim expression, and when [Chen Dewen] tried to step forward to calm the situation, [Lin Jianqing] pushed him away forcefully.
0:29:43|0:29:50|[Fang Xiaoxiao] leaned against the door eating something, while the neighbor man asked with a meaningful look.
0:30:20|0:30:34|[Lin Jianqing] finished speaking and excitedly slapped his leg. When he turned his head and saw [Fang Xiaoxiao] by chance, his smile immediately disappeared. The neighbor man looked at them with a suggestive expression.
0:31:1|0:31:8|[Lin Jianqing] glanced at [Fang Xiaoxiao] and asked.
0:31:34|0:31:40|Lin Jianqing's expression gradually became serious.
0:31:51|0:31:59|[Lin Jianqing] stood up, hands in pockets leaning against the wall, sneering.
0:32:3|0:32:10|[Fang Xiaoxiao] ignored him and rolled her eyes at him. At this moment, a person approached the stall and asked mysteriously.
0:32:38|0:32:44|[Fang Xiaoxiao] saw that the two were about to fight, so she had to come up with a quick solution and shouted.
0:33:0|0:33:11|Back in the rental room, [Fang Xiaoxiao] hung up the phone after making instant noodles. [Lin Jianqing] said with a dark expression.
0:33:31|0:33:36|Lin Jianqing's face changed, and he turned his head to ask.
0:33:49|0:33:54|Lin Jianqing impatiently extended his right hand to smell under his nose, then handed it to Fang Xiaoxiao.
0:34:4|0:34:18|[Lin Jianqing] tapped the mouse to tease [Fang Xiaoxiao], but she ended up laughing. At night, the soft light from the night lamp on the bedside table illuminated the room, as the two lay on their respective beds, both staring blankly with their eyes open.
0:34:18|0:34:35|[Fang Xiaoxiao] suddenly sat up and leaned half of her body out, with her hands on [Lin Jianqing]'s bed, looking at him seriously. As soon as [Lin Jianqing] heard the movement, he immediately closed his eyes pretending to be asleep. When [Fang Xiaoxiao] spoke, [Lin Jianqing] pretended not to hear, ignoring her.
0:34:44|0:34:51|[Lin Jianqing] couldn't help but join in the conversation.
0:34:57|0:35:10|[Fang Xiaoxiao] stopped asking questions when she saw the situation, got up and returned to the bed. At this moment, there was another strange noise upstairs. [Lin Jianqing] handed the Walkman to [Fang Xiaoxiao], who didn't take it, and instead lay down on the bed and shouted.
0:35:59|0:36:15|The underground passage became more crowded, with people coming and going in a hurry. [Fang Xiaoxiao], wearing a thick coat and carrying a backpack, suddenly appeared in the underground passage. She held a new phone in her hand and waved it at [Lin Jianqing]. She opened the phone's camera, leaned against [Lin Jianqing], and smiled to herself.
0:36:23|0:36:34|[Fang Xiaoxiao] turned around excitedly and ran to a nearby wall to squat down, then called [Lin Jianqing]. [Lin Jianqing] answered the phone with a helpless expression on his face.
0:36:48|0:36:54|[Fang Xiaoxiao] was stunned, she pondered for a moment and then raised her eyebrows disapprovingly, standing up and saying.
0:36:56|0:37:7|[Fang Xiaoxiao] put down her phone and returned to [Lin Jianqing]'s stall, squatting against the wall. She couldn't help but laugh as she looked at [Lin Jianqing], who was staring intently at her, trying to figure something out.
0:37:7|0:37:14|[Fang Xiaoxiao] pretended to smile lightly to hide her inner sadness, while [Lin Jianqing] started packing without saying a word.
0:37:15|0:37:23|[Lin Jianqing] picked up the backpack and said. [Fang Xiaoxiao] didn't react immediately, looking puzzled as she helped [Lin Jianqing] pack up their things together.
0:37:24|0:37:34|In the evening, the two of them arrived at a shopping mall. The hall was decorated with beautiful balloons and colorful lights, surrounded by a sea of people, all dressed in festive attire. Everyone was wearing deer antlers on their heads and holding glow sticks.
0:37:48|0:38:3|Fang Xiaoxiao's smile disappeared instantly as his boyfriend appeared on the screen, holding hands with another woman, the two of them intimately making a heart shape towards the camera, pushing a baby stroller. The family of three looked harmonious and happy. Fang Xiaoxiao's expression turned anxious as he watched.
0:38:3|0:38:15|Gradually realizing that she was actually a clown, she stared blankly ahead, at a loss. [Lin Jianqing] looked at her with great pity and yanked off her wig.
0:38:16|0:38:32|[Lin Jianqing] looked at [Fang Xiaoxiao] with a sense of grievance, his eyes filled with reproach and tenderness. [Fang Xiaoxiao] looked like a child who had done something wrong, holding back tears as he gazed at [Lin Jianqing]. [Lin Jianqing] put on the wig, carefully tucking the stray hairs behind his ears, and the two of them smiled at each other.
0:38:33|0:38:45|[Lin Jianqing] patted [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s shoulder to comfort her, and then they left. They returned to the rental house, where the table was filled with all kinds of delicious food and beer. They drank and played games together.
0:38:49|0:39:4|They drank until their faces were flushed, each holding a cigarette, forcing themselves to laugh heartily. [Lin Jianqing] suddenly reached out and tousled [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s hair, making it messy. After drinking, both of them got drunk and vented their emotions in the room with music playing.
0:39:4|0:39:7|[Fang Xiaoxiao] jumps around with a blanket, swaying her head and body to the rhythm.
0:39:29|0:39:35|The two sat facing each other, and [Lin Jianqing] patted his chest.
0:40:1|0:40:7|[Fang Xiaoxiao] paused for a moment and said.
0:40:14|0:40:21|[Fang Xiaoxiao] grinned widely and looked at the lowered head of [Lin Jianqing].
0:40:24|0:40:38|[Lin Jianqing] nodded his head slightly. [Fang Xiaoxiao] sighed and shook her head. [Lin Jianqing] smiled bitterly and nodded, suddenly remembering the New Year countdown outside, [Lin Jianqing] looked up.
0:40:49|0:41:11|Outside was bustling with excitement, fireworks lighting up the sky and voices echoing. Inside, two people were tightly embracing each other, seeking solace. The smiles on their faces gradually faded into pain, furrowing their brows tightly, trying hard to forget. After a long while, [Fang Xiaoxiao] took the initiative to let go of [Lin Jianqing]'s hand, lowering her head and no longer looking at him.
0:41:11|0:41:24|[Lin Jianqing] was still immersed in it, hesitated for a moment before slowly putting his hand down, reluctant to look at [Fang Xiaoxiao]. Then the reluctance in his eyes gradually disappeared, becoming more determined, he decided not to be timid anymore.
0:41:26|0:41:32|Fang Xiaoxiao saw his intention, pushed away his face as he leaned in, and then unexpectedly wrapped her arms around Lin Jianqing's neck and kissed him.
0:42:37|0:42:51|Early the next morning, [Lin Jianqing] got up and rushed out onto the street, just to buy breakfast for [Fang Xiaoxiao]. Excitedly carrying the breakfast back, he carefully pushed open the door upon his return, afraid of waking [Fang Xiaoxiao]. But after opening the door, [Lin Jianqing] froze.
0:42:51|0:43:8|Standing at the door, looking at the empty room with no one in sight, feeling lost, he took out the breakfast that he was worried would get cold and placed it on the table. Then, [Lin Jianqing] sat on the edge of the bed, expressionless, and called [Fang Xiaoxiao], but no one answered. By noon, there was still no news from [Fang Xiaoxiao].
0:43:8|0:43:16|[Lin Jianqing] sat in front of the computer desk, absentmindedly playing games while constantly trying to contact [Fang Xiaoxiao]. In the evening, [Fang Xiaoxiao] finally answered the phone.
0:43:36|0:43:50|[Fang Xiaoxiao] stood in the KTV restroom, speaking indifferently. [Fang Xiaoxiao] said calmly. On the other end of the phone, [Lin Jianqing] was stunned, and the scene then shifted to a hotel room at the airport in 2018.
0:45:23|0:45:40|The two of them recalled the past and laughed together, as if they had truly returned to the past in an instant. So when their thoughts returned to reality, they were left with endless silence. They looked at each other but couldn't smile anymore, their faces showing an undeniable sadness.
0:45:40|0:45:57|They clearly understood that there was no turning back, but both of them obviously hadn't let go of their feelings for each other. The longing in their eyes slowly faded, replaced by a sense of loneliness after facing reality. [Lin Jianqing] eyes welled up with mist, revealing a sense of unwillingness and reluctance.
0:45:57|0:46:4|[Fang Xiaoxiao] lowered her head first, followed by [Lin Jianqing], as the scene shifted back to 2008.
0:46:10|0:46:13|Fang Xiaoxiao returned to the rental house but did not see Lin Jianqing.
0:46:44|0:47:0|She came to the detention center to look for [Lin Jianqing], but was turned away by the staff. The door closed, [Fang Xiaoxiao] didn't leave, standing at the door unable to snap out of it for a long time. Then she turned and walked away, slowly approaching not far from the gate. She turned around again, staring blankly at the gate of the detention center.
0:47:0|0:47:6|As the New Year's Eve approaches, [Fang Xiaoxiao] returns to her hometown and sits down with [Lin Jianqing]'s family to have the reunion dinner.
0:48:26|0:48:40|[Lin's Father] silently returned to the kitchen to clean up the dishes and utensils. [Fang Xiaoxiao] helped out beside him.
0:49:46|0:50:9|[Lin's Father] prepared chili sauce in the jar while speaking. [Fang Xiaoxiao] stood silently on the side. She lowered her head, unable to maintain the fake smile she had worn all day. She dared not answer [Lin's Father]'s question, but also did not want to lie again. In the evening, [Lin] escorted [Fang Xiaoxiao] out.
0:50:9|0:50:27|Handing a pile of delicious food to [Fang Xiaoxiao], [Lin's Father] endured all night, finally couldn't help but inquire about [Lin Jianqing]'s recent situation to [Fang Xiaoxiao]. However, [Fang Xiaoxiao] quickly dodged the question and hurriedly left.
0:50:27|0:50:43|[Lin's Father] stood still, looking at the back of [Fang Xiaoxiao] with a pensive expression. He could tell that [Fang Xiaoxiao] was deliberately hiding something, knowing deep down that his son must not be living well. However, he chose not to inquire further. [Fang Xiaoxiao] quickly walked towards home, unable to hold back her tears.
0:50:43|0:50:53|She was afraid that Lin Jianqing would see through her, keeping everything hidden in her heart and bearing it alone. The forced smiles all night made Fang Xiaoxiao feel extremely suppressed, and at this moment, she could finally cry out loud.
0:50:53|0:51:10|[Lin's Father] sat by the stove, placing the peeled walnuts next to the stove, but the person who eats walnuts did not show up. In the blink of an eye, it was the day when [Lin Jianqing] was released from prison, and [Fang Xiaoxiao] was already waiting at the detention center gate. The staff opened the door, and [Lin Jianqing] walked out with a bag.
0:51:10|0:51:23|He ignored [Fang Xiaoxiao] standing at the door and walked straight to the side. [Fang Xiaoxiao] hugged her frozen body and ran after [Lin Jianqing], handing a bag to [Lin Jianqing].
0:52:27|0:52:42|[Lin Jianqing] had just finished speaking when [Fang Xiaoxiao] grabbed his head and kissed him, then let go and stepped back, looking at the still dazed [Lin Jianqing] with a mischievous smile. [Lin Jianqing] stood there, unsure of what to do.
0:52:54|0:53:0|[Lin Jianqing] smiled and walked away without answering her, leaving [Fang Xiaoxiao] in disbelief as she grabbed onto [Lin Jianqing].
0:53:4|0:53:19|[Fang Xiaoxiao] pretended to be angry, but found [Lin Jianqing] indifferent. She immediately turned and ran forward, [Lin Jianqing] smiled and hugged [Fang Xiaoxiao] from behind. He laughed like a child, as if he had obtained a rare treasure, holding [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s hand and running forward.
0:53:19|0:53:32|The two of them naturally came together like this. Like most couples in love, they stuck together every day. They hugged on the subway, reluctant to part when they arrived at their stop. As the weather warmed up,
0:53:32|0:53:45|[Lin Jianqing] rode a bicycle with [Fang Xiaoxiao] sitting on the handlebars, looking at [Lin Jianqing]. The two of them laughed as they rode along a small path in the woods, even the kites in the sky were paired up.
0:53:47|0:54:3|[Lin Jianqing] is earnestly designing sketches for his gaming dream. [Fang Xiaoxiao] lies on the bed, flipping through [Lin Jianqing]'s draft sketches page by page.
0:54:14|0:54:33|[Lin Jianqing] was lying on the table drawing and speaking. [Lin Jianqing] said without looking back. [Fang Xiaoxiao] finished reading the draft and sat up on the bed seriously. [Fang Xiaoxiao] smirked. Seeing this, [Lin Jianqing] laughed and pounced over.
0:54:50|0:55:9|As soon as the words fell, the scene shifted to 2018, the colorless world in [Lin Jianqing]'s mouth. [Fang Xiaoxiao] stood in front of the bathroom mirror, carefully dressing herself, then suddenly woke up. She realized she had the wrong idea, forced herself to wake up, and after a long silence,
0:55:9|0:55:25|She reached out and took off the earring on her ear, regaining her composure. She looked at herself in the mirror, no longer fantasizing about unrealistic things. She pushed open the door of the bathroom and walked out, with [Lin Jianqing] lying on one side of the bed and [Fang Xiaoxiao] sitting on the other side, saying.
0:55:26|0:55:42|[Lin Jianqing] looked at her, guessing her intention, hesitated for a moment, and then reached out his hand. [Lin Jianqing] smiled, understood Xiaoxiao's meaning, and extended his other hand. Xiaoxiao leaned forward to smell it, then lifted her arm to smell her own hand and said.
0:55:44|0:55:53|[Fang Xiaoxiao] leaned against the pillow, looked up at the ceiling and smiled. At that moment, [Lin Jianqing]'s phone rang. He glanced at Xiaoxiao and answered the video call with a smile.
0:57:4|0:57:22|[Lin Jianqing] hung up the phone, only to find that Xiaoxiao had closed the door and gone out. He immediately got up and opened the door to look for her, but found no one in the hallway. Reluctantly, he looked around and confirmed that Xiaoxiao had left, then turned back to the room. He walked straight to the window, trying to catch a glimpse of Xiaoxiao's figure.
0:57:22|0:57:40|Outside the window is a vast expanse of white, with ice and snow, illuminating the night brightly and cleanly. [Lin Jianqing] bent down and focused his gaze, only to see Xiaoxiao standing in the snow waving her hands towards him. The scene then shifts to a particularly cold night in winter in Beijing in 2008.
0:57:42|0:57:52|[Fang Xiaoxiao] and [Lin Jianqing] are standing by the roadside waiting for the last bus. [Fang Xiaoxiao] reaches around from behind and hugs [Lin Jianqing] around the waist. [Lin Jianqing] smiles, then turns around and pulls her into his arms, affectionately patting her head.
0:57:52|0:58:4|Lin Jianqing then lifted Fang Xiaoxiao's arm and placed her on the roadside railing. Fang Xiaoxiao pretended that she wasn't sitting securely, leaning her body backwards and swinging her legs in the air.
0:58:12|0:58:28|[Lin Jianqing] looked up at [Fang Xiaoxiao], feeling both heartache and guilt as he hugged her tightly. The two of them held each other closely. [Fang Xiaoxiao] smiled happily and said, then she hugged [Lin Jianqing] even tighter. [Lin Jianqing] looked at her in confusion.
0:58:44|0:58:52|Watching [Fang Xiaoxiao] in silence for a moment, he smiled and lifted her down from the railing.
0:58:59|0:59:5|[Lin Jianqing] insisted on taking a taxi home, so the two of them excitedly stood by the roadside waving at passing taxis.
0:59:17|0:59:28|[Fang Xiaoxiao] leaned half of her body out of the car window, screaming wildly outside, while [Lin Jianqing] stood beside her, feeling both amused and worried as he pulled her back. The two of them cuddled together, envisioning the future.
0:59:44|0:59:51|[Lin Jianqing] took a job as a telephone customer service representative to make a living, while [Fang Xiaoxiao] joined a real estate company and was bullied everywhere.
1:0:1|1:0:17|Eating a bowl of instant noodles together can also be enjoyable. During the day, Fang Xiaoxiao sneaks into the corridor to secretly contact [Lin Jianqing]. The sweetness of love envelops the two of them. Even if work is tough and exhausting, receiving an encouraging text message from each other can instantly relieve all fatigue.
1:0:17|1:0:24|The two of them, in different places, but with the same smile on their faces, as if the other was right in front of them.
1:0:27|1:0:41|One day, Lin Jianqing received a call from Fang Xiaoxiao and hurried back home, only to find Fang Xiaoxiao lying on a discarded old sofa. Lin Jianqing glanced at Fang Xiaoxiao, turned and walked towards home, with Fang Xiaoxiao quickly following.
1:0:44|1:0:55|[Fang Xiaoxiao] was lying on the old sofa, staring at [Lin Jianqing] without moving. Despite [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s coquettish behavior, [Lin Jianqing] remained unmoved. He grabbed her hand and pulled her down, and [Fang Xiaoxiao] hugged [Lin Jianqing]'s neck.
1:0:58|1:1:5|[Fang Xiaoxiao] propped one leg on the sofa, unwilling to leave, holding onto [Lin Jianqing], pouting and acting coquettishly. [Lin Jianqing] helplessly agreed.
1:1:16|1:1:24|[Lin Jianqing] lifts [Fang Xiaoxiao] up from the sofa and sits with her on the bed. He then closes the door.
1:2:31|1:2:49|[Fang Xiaoxiao] hooked her arm around [Lin Jianqing]'s neck and looked up. The scene shifted to 2018. [Fang Xiaoxiao] wrapped herself tightly, wearing a knitted hat, sitting in the snow. [Lin Jianqing] sat not far from her, holding a bottle of liquor, drinking sullenly.
1:3:20|1:3:28|[Lin Jianqing] looked at [Fang Xiaoxiao] in disbelief, [Fang Xiaoxiao] showed a sad expression, then suddenly burst into laughter.
1:3:40|1:3:51|The two stood up and walked down the steps. [Fang Xiaoxiao] finished the last sip of wine in the bottle.
1:4:14|1:4:16|After Fang Xiaoxiao finished speaking, the two fell silent again.
1:4:17|1:4:25|The scene shifts back to the past, approaching the Spring Festival of 2009. [Lin Jianqing] is driving with [Fang Xiaoxiao] in the passenger seat, both of them humming a song.
1:6:56|1:7:3|[Zheng Huan] put his arm around [Lin Jianqing]'s shoulder and earnestly advised him. This seemingly kind gesture, however, tore apart the dignity that [Lin Jianqing] had carefully protected all along.
1:7:3|1:7:14|Returning home, Lin's Father was busy in the kitchen, ladling soup into bowls. He turned and pushed the door open, saying to Lin Jianqing. Lin's Father handed the bowl to Lin Jianqing.
1:7:18|1:7:25|[Lin Jianqing] squatted on the ground without saying a word, while [Fang Xiaoxiao] took over [Lin's Father]'s bowl beside him.
1:7:27|1:7:50|[Lin's Father] stood up straight, and [Lin Jianqing] frowned but didn't say anything. [Lin Jianqing] had red eyes, showing a painful and helpless expression. He held back tears, stood up by the pile of firewood, and let out a deep sigh. He shook off [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s hand.
1:7:51|1:7:58|Opening the door and walking out while talking, [Fang Xiaoxiao] stood still in place.
1:8:2|1:8:14|[Lin's Father] showed no emotion, turned and walked into the kitchen. [Fang Xiaoxiao] and [Lin Jianqing] were getting ready to return to Beijing. [Fang Xiaoxiao] was driving, with [Lin Jianqing] sitting in the passenger seat with his eyes closed. [Fang Xiaoxiao] patted his shoulder, trying to comfort him.
1:8:17|1:8:24|[Lin Jianqing] opened his eyes but still looked drunk.
1:8:36|1:8:43|[Lin Jianqing] closed his eyes in pain and said.
1:9:17|1:9:32|[Fang Xiaoxiao] finally couldn't control her emotions and burst out. [Lin Jianqing] had nothing to say, turned his head to the other side, tears uncontrollably streaming down his face. [Fang Xiaoxiao] also cried, she really didn't care anymore whether [Lin Jianqing] could give her the stable life she wanted.
1:9:32|1:9:42|From the moment they were together, Lin Jianqing's dream became her dream. Lin Jianqing didn't understand, he was just reaching out to help Fang Xiaoxiao wipe away her tears.
1:9:47|1:9:54|[Lin Jianqing] is trapped in his wounded pride, stubbornly believing that he is useless, and gradually starts to become decadent and corrupt.
1:10:23|1:10:30|At this moment, a slender man in sunglasses walked into Lin Jianqing's company and cautiously spoke to the receptionist.
1:10:35|1:10:47|A man came to the customer service department looking for someone. [Lin Jianqing] took off his headset and stood up, while the man took off his sunglasses and cursed.
1:11:0|1:11:17|At the table next to them, two men were drinking, with one consoling the other who was heartbroken. [Fang Xiaoxiao] and [Lin Jianqing] both looked gloomy, ignoring each other, sitting quietly. The sound of traffic on the street and the noise from the next table made their silence even more pronounced.
1:11:24|1:11:37|[Lin Jianqing] noticed that [Fang Xiaoxiao] kept looking back at the man at the next table, so he sarcastically asked. [Fang Xiaoxiao] suppressed her anger and replied. [Fang Xiaoxiao] packed up her things to leave on her own, but [Lin Jianqing] remained seated for a long time, turning his head to look at the next table.
1:11:44|1:12:1|At this moment, [Lin Jianqing] suddenly rushed forward as if going crazy, kicking the man at the next table to the ground. People around screamed and fled, and three people started fighting. Seeing the chaos in front of her, [Fang Xiaoxiao] broke down, grabbed a bottle of alcohol from the table, took a few sips, then smashed the bottle and charged forward.
1:12:12|1:12:29|[Lin Jianqing] was pushed to the ground by [Fang Xiaoxiao]. He sat by the wall like a soulless body, motionless. The madness from earlier disappeared without a trace, gradually regaining his senses. Later, the two sat silently on the bus, with [Lin Jianqing] resting his head against the window and [Fang Xiaoxiao] lost in thought.
1:12:29|1:12:47|The sweetness between the two has been completely worn out. [Lin Jianqing] has been tortured by life, making his character even more eccentric. He argues with customers as a customer service representative, and after being beaten up by a customer and taking it out on innocent passersby, [Fang Xiaoxiao] can no longer cry watching this [Lin Jianqing].
1:12:47|1:12:50|She felt more and more overwhelmed, and could only work desperately.
1:13:8|1:13:16|The male customer made advances towards [Fang Xiaoxiao], getting closer to her and even putting his hand on her shoulder. [Fang Xiaoxiao] pushed him away and quickly fled.
1:13:24|1:13:31|[Lin Jianqing] returned to the room from the bathroom with a basin in his arms, [Fang Xiaoxiao] was half lying on the small sofa, and [Lin Jianqing] sat in front of the computer desk.
1:14:3|1:14:18|[Fang Xiaoxiao] looked at [Lin Jianqing] coldly, hoping to get a reasonable explanation, but [Lin Jianqing] didn't know how to respond and stood up, turning his back to [Fang Xiaoxiao]. [Fang Xiaoxiao] looked at [Lin Jianqing] disappointedly, then looked away without asking further. [Lin Jianqing]'s silence had already given her the answer.
1:14:18|1:14:26|It was not the answer she wanted. At this moment, Lin Jianqing's phone rang, breaking the silence.
1:14:31|1:14:45|The landlord drove them away with a harsh tone, leaving no room for negotiation. [Fang Xiaoxiao] showed no reaction upon hearing this, still staring blankly on the sofa. [Lin Jianqing] lit a cigarette without saying a word, and threw his phone heavily on the table.
1:14:45|1:14:56|One wave had not subsided before another rose, and the two spent a year in endless cold war. Life tortured Lin Jianqing more and more decadent, and he used this emotion to torment Fang Xiaoxiao who accompanied him.
1:14:56|1:15:13|A year has passed in the blink of an eye, and it's New Year's Eve in 2010. However, neither of them has gone home this year. Instead, they were forced to move out under the pressure of the landlord. [Lin Jianqing] moved the luggage one by one onto the tricycle by the roadside, then patted the packed luggage on the tricycle to make sure everything was securely tied.
1:15:13|1:15:25|[Fang Xiaoxiao] stood on the side holding a package and staring blankly. [Lin Jianqing] approached and gently pushed [Fang Xiaoxiao]. The two of them sat in the back of a tricycle, with [Lin Jianqing] wrapping his arm around the hemp rope tied to the luggage.
1:15:27|1:15:35|The tricycle started to sway as it moved, with the luggage piled high on top swaying dangerously. [Lin Jianqing] extended his arm to shield [Fang Xiaoxiao] from falling off.
1:15:36|1:15:55|The tricycle went further and further away, the small sofa that was once treasured by [Fang Xiaoxiao] was left behind, [Fang Xiaoxiao] had begged [Lin Jianqing] to bring it back home, but now it was casually abandoned by the roadside, just like their love left in that rented room and could no longer be taken away.
1:15:55|1:16:16|Shortly after, the two moved into a basement house, where they could see the bustling footsteps and faint sunlight on the ground through the window. [Fang Xiaoxiao] stood in front of the window, staring blankly. Suddenly, she saw a wild flower growing by the roadside outside the window. The small flower swayed its delicate body in the sunlight and breeze, appearing fragile but full of vitality.
1:16:16|1:16:33|[Lin Jianqing] moved the luggage into the house one by one, sitting at the door watching the back of [Fang Xiaoxiao]. His eyes were filled with timidity, inferiority, pain, and grievance, not daring to speak to [Fang Xiaoxiao]. The sound of fireworks outside the window signaled the start of the new year, with everyone celebrating in a lively atmosphere.
1:16:33|1:16:45|However, in Lin Jianqing and Fang Xiaoxiao's room, it was cold and distant. Fang Xiaoxiao sat on the bed, staring out the window. Lin Jianqing was frantically playing games at the computer desk, avoiding reality.
1:16:58|1:17:6|Passes the phone to Lin Jianqing, who is playing a game. Lin Jianqing glances at the phone and takes off the earphones.
1:17:46|1:18:0|[Lin Jianqing] paused for a moment and said, "Both father and son are insincere, pretending to be doing well." Upon hearing his son's greeting, old [Lin's Father] felt a pang of sadness. Reluctantly, he hung up the phone and returned to the dining table.
1:18:10|1:18:18|On the morning of the first day of the lunar new year, there was no one on the streets of Beijing. [Lin Jianqing] and [Fang Xiaoxiao] walked on the road, with a distance of nearly two meters between them.
1:18:18|1:18:40|[Lin Jianqing], with half of his face covered by a scarf and hands in his pockets, walked silently. The two seemed like lifeless bodies, with no communication or physical contact. They later sat above the city wall, overlooking the Forbidden City with its red walls and yellow tiles. [Lin Jianqing] remained silent.
1:18:40|1:18:57|The two fell into silence again, as if falling into an ice cave. At night, they returned to the rental room, with [Fang Xiaoxiao] expressionlessly eating instant noodles leaning on the table. [Lin Jianqing] was still sitting in front of the computer desk playing games. [Fang Xiaoxiao] stopped her chopsticks and said. [Lin Jianqing] was wearing headphones.
1:18:57|1:19:13|The sound of gunfire in the game came through the headphones, deafening. He couldn't hear [Fang Xiaoxiao] speaking, just frantically clicking the mouse. [Fang Xiaoxiao] covered the remaining noodles, picked up a jar, and poured the last bit of sauce into the lid.
1:19:16|1:19:31|[Fang Xiaoxiao] mustered up the courage to say these words, but her voice kept trembling. She knew that [Lin Jianqing] couldn't hear her, and she didn't expect a response. Then she stood up, turned around, walked to the side of the bed, reached out and picked up the hat on the bed, slowly put it on her head, and tidied her hair.
1:19:31|1:19:49|She then picked up the backpack that had been packed up earlier, put it on her back, took the scarf from the shelf, turned around and walked to [Lin Jianqing]'s side, saying. [Lin Jianqing] ignored her, paying no attention, and continued playing the game. [Fang Xiaoxiao] held onto the last glimmer of hope.
1:19:49|1:20:3|To get a response from [Lin Jianqing], but his refusal to communicate extinguished the last hope. The light in [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s eyes disappeared in an instant, her gaze became resolute, and she left without hesitation.
1:20:3|1:20:18|[Lin Jianqing] stopped what he was doing when he heard a noise, turned his head to look towards the door. He thought [Fang Xiaoxiao] had just gone out and would be back soon, so he turned back to continue playing the game. It was only later that he realized something was wrong, turned around again to look at the door, and found [Fang Xiaoxiao] had disappeared without a trace.
1:20:18|1:20:28|He realized that [Fang Xiaoxiao] had really left, so he immediately took off his headphones and ran after her, knocking over the chair next to the computer in his haste.
1:20:28|1:20:38|Fang Xiaoxiao's half-bowl of noodles almost had its lid knocked off by Lin Jianqing as he ran past the clothes hanging in the hallway.
1:20:38|1:20:52|On the first day of the lunar new year, with few people in the subway station, [Lin Jianqing] ran wildly to lift the curtain of the subway station door, looking around for the figure of [Fang Xiaoxiao]. He tried to swipe the ticket several times but couldn't get through, so he violently pushed open the gate and ran in.
1:20:52|1:21:7|He ran down the stairs gasping for breath, anxiously looking at the empty train carriage. The subway was about to depart, [Lin Jianqing] searched for [Fang Xiaoxiao] outside the carriage, running frantically and looking into the adjacent carriages, finally spotting [Fang Xiaoxiao] in one of the carriages.
1:21:7|1:21:14|He stood outside the car door, took a deep breath, and looked at [Fang Xiaoxiao] with a gasp. [Fang Xiaoxiao] had red eyes, with a look of despair in her eyes.
1:21:14|1:21:30|Upon seeing [Lin Jianqing], a hint of imperceptible joy flashed in her eyes. As the subway doors slowly closed, [Fang Xiaoxiao] looked ashen-faced, devoid of any emotion in her eyes. She stared blankly at the man she had loved for two years, and in that moment, her heart died.
1:21:30|1:21:42|The train started moving, [Fang Xiaoxiao] moved away like a stranger. [Lin Jianqing] stared at [Fang Xiaoxiao], took two steps forward with the train, unable to believe that [Fang Xiaoxiao] had left him like this.
1:21:42|1:21:56|[Fang Xiaoxiao] glanced back at [Lin Jianqing] once again as the train quickly departed. [Lin Jianqing] never found the courage to step into the carriage. His hesitation and timidity caused him to completely lose [Fang Xiaoxiao]. He stood in place for a long time, unable to snap out of it.
1:22:5|1:22:21|To reminisce about the missed love. [Lin Jianqing] frowned and continued.
1:22:26|1:22:33|[Lin Jianqing] looked up, imagining what could have been between them.
1:22:36|1:22:46|[Lin Jianqing] fell silent for a moment, then smiled and turned to walk forward, with [Fang Xiaoxiao] following closely behind. [Lin Jianqing] spoke again, unwillingly.
1:22:56|1:23:19|[Lin Jianqing] was determined to get an original copy of the book. However, [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s response left him speechless. After a moment of contemplation, he sighed. He stared at [Fang Xiaoxiao] intently, his tone filled with helplessness and regret. Looking back at him, [Fang Xiaoxiao] said.
1:23:20|1:23:34|In a prolonged silence, [Lin Jianqing] gradually felt his eyes moisten as he was deeply hurt by [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s words. He frowned and looked at [Fang Xiaoxiao], whose eyes were also filled with tears, no longer avoiding true emotions as before.
1:23:34|1:23:47|[Lin Jianqing], unable to restrain his emotions any longer, suddenly stepped forward and grabbed [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s hand. The two of them ran wildly in the snow, as if they had returned to the past, ignoring everything. They returned to the hotel and pushed open the door.
1:23:49|1:23:57|The two stopped. The man noticed [Fang Xiaoxiao] standing beside them.
1:24:2|1:24:18|The man walked with a girl, looking at [Lin Jianqing] with understanding. The girl beside the man avoided his gaze, obviously not his wife. The man mistakenly thought that [Lin Jianqing] and [Fang Xiaoxiao] were also in this kind of relationship, so he warmly greeted them. [Fang Xiaoxiao] let go of [Lin Jianqing]'s hand and said.
1:24:20|1:24:28|[Lin Jianqing] also felt very embarrassed. He regained his composure, nodded slightly, and said.
1:24:31|1:24:37|[Fang Xiaoxiao] didn't look at him, then the two of them rented a car and sat in the front row laughing together.
1:26:21|1:26:28|He sniffed, looked away, sighed deeply. He didn't expect that in the end, they would still lose to reality.
1:26:32|1:26:44|[Fang Xiaoxiao] suddenly leaned over and kept calling out [Lin Jianqing], looking at him with wide eyes. After [Fang Xiaoxiao] finished speaking seriously, [Lin Jianqing]'s voice started to tremble.
1:26:51|1:27:3|With tears streaming down his face, [Lin Jianqing] forced a smile as he looked at [Fang Xiaoxiao], nodding gently while tears continued to flow. [Fang Xiaoxiao] felt extremely wronged, her nose tingling as she pursed her lips.
1:27:5|1:27:25|[Lin Jianqing] empathized and could only close his eyes and turn his head. [Fang Xiaoxiao] cried like a child, tightly shutting her eyes, letting tears flow down her face.
1:27:35|1:27:42|[Lin Jianqing] furrowed his brows in pain, trying hard to restrain his impending emotional breakdown.
1:27:49|1:28:3|He turned his head to [Fang Xiaoxiao] and finished the sentence, but dared not look directly at her face, immediately shifting his gaze away. [Fang Xiaoxiao] lowered her eyes, her face covered in countless tear marks. She gathered up the courage to ask.
1:28:6|1:28:22|[Lin Jianqing] did not answer, but instead asked the same question. This time, he did not avoid [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s gaze, but stared into her eyes intently. Like a beggar, his eyes were filled with pleading, desperately seeking an answer.
1:28:25|1:28:42|Crying convulsively, [Lin Jianqing] reached out his arms and embraced the tearful [Fang Xiaoxiao], closing his eyes and kissing her head with tears streaming down his face, unwilling to let go. [Fang Xiaoxiao] leaned against [Lin Jianqing]'s chest and cried freely, as if the two had returned to the past.
1:28:43|1:29:7|In 2010, having just lost [Fang Xiaoxiao], [Lin Jianqing] spent this incredibly long night alone. As the sky gradually brightened, the basement rental was particularly quiet, with only the dripping sound of a leaking water pipe. There was no heating in the room, so [Lin Jianqing] had to wear a cotton coat and wrap himself in a quilt. He stayed awake all night, staring blankly ahead, devoid of vitality.
1:29:7|1:29:21|He suddenly stood up, as if gone mad, smashing everything on the shelf next to him to the ground, then turning around to overturn the night light and photo album on the table behind him. In a moment, the room was in a mess.
1:29:21|1:29:30|After venting his emotions, [Lin Jianqing] calmed down and let himself go, collapsing on the bed and lying in a straight line. After a while,
1:29:30|1:29:58|He got up again and sat on the edge of the bed, lit a cigarette, looked around, extinguished the cigarette, squatted on the ground and tidied up the items he had messed up. He made the bed neatly, the room was refreshed, he opened the window, the first ray of morning sunlight shone into the room, and outside the window came the chirping of birds. The little wild flower by the window grew even more wildly and brilliantly.
1:30:18|1:30:31|[Lin Jianqing] starts writing the story of Ian and Kelly again. At the end of the game, Ian doesn't find Kelly, and a line of text appears on the screen: "If you find Kelly, please tell her I'm sorry."
1:30:33|1:30:39|He recalled the words he had once said.
1:30:41|1:30:53|After the game ended, with Ian's failure, everything began to fall apart. The game interface turned gray, bats flew frantically in the sky, and Ian also fell into a deep abyss.
1:31:21|1:31:27|[Lin Jianqing] rode a motorcycle under the scorching sun, with a pile of express delivery packages tied behind him like a small mountain.
1:31:55|1:32:2|Until he saw this game entering every household, many people transformed into the little boy Ian, searching for his own Kelly in the game.
1:32:20|1:32:39|He smoked silently, tears streaming down his face. He had succeeded. But there was no one to share his joy with. He stared at the number for a long time, a tear finally escaping from the corner of his eye. His hard work had finally paid off, earning the recognition of a prestigious company.
1:33:59|1:34:6|After both of them were exhausted and panting heavily, they collapsed on the steps. After resting for a moment, [Lin Jianqing] picked up [Fang Xiaoxiao].
1:34:19|1:34:24|In the flashback, Lin Jianqing and Fang Xiaoxiao are riding bicycles side by side on the road.
1:34:26|1:34:42|On the TV screen, [Lin Jianqing] finished telling the story, his eyes looking at the camera filled with longing for the past. [Fang Xiaoxiao] looked at him, tears suddenly welling up in her eyes. With money now, [Lin Jianqing] was preparing to buy a house in Beijing.
1:35:10|1:35:17|The real estate agent enthusiastically introduced the house to [Lin Jianqing], who looked at her and momentarily thought he saw [Fang Xiaoxiao].
1:35:25|1:35:42|Suddenly attracted by the sight downstairs, on a tricycle parked below, there was the sofa that he and [Fang Xiaoxiao] had abandoned in the rental house. As the tricycle drove further and further away, disappearing from sight, [Lin Jianqing] hurried forward, wanting to see more clearly.
1:35:44|1:36:0|[Fang Xiaoxiao] had been busy all day and finally it was time to clock out. Her colleagues left first, leaving her to tidy up the shop and prepare to close. Suddenly, she received a text message from [Lin Jianqing], asking if she was going home for the Chinese New Year this year. [Fang Xiaoxiao] was stunned for a while, but ultimately ignored [Lin Jianqing].
1:36:0|1:36:17|Turning around and closing the shop door. She came out of the shop and walked in the corridor of the mall, and her phone started ringing again. [Lin Jianqing] asked her how she was doing recently? [Fang Xiaoxiao] still ignored him, went straight downstairs to get ready to ride her bike home. Just as she unlocked her bike, [Lin Jianqing] sent another message.
1:36:17|1:36:35|[Lin Jianqing] tentatively asked: "Shall we go back together?" Then he said: "My dad always asks about you, but I just can't bring myself to say it, we broke up." [Fang Xiaoxiao] ignored him and rode away on her bicycle. In the blink of an eye, it was New Year's Eve in 2011.
1:36:46|1:36:56|[Lin Jianqing] returned to his hometown and bought a new TV for the family, patiently teaching [Lin's Father] how to use it. [Fang Xiaoxiao] was busy tidying up the dining table nearby.
1:39:16|1:39:26|Lin's Father stubbornly refused Lin Jianqing's kindness, Lin Jianqing turned and walked out in anger. Fang Xiaoxiao hurriedly followed, catching up with Lin Jianqing's steps.
1:40:2|1:40:13|[Lin Jianqing] hesitated to speak, finding it difficult to bring up the topic with [Fang Xiaoxiao], so he turned his head in frustration and said. After hanging his head in silence for a while, [Lin Jianqing] spoke up.
1:40:44|1:40:50|[Lin Jianqing] unwillingly chased after her, and when [Fang Xiaoxiao] heard this, she slowed down and turned around to speak.
1:40:52|1:41:9|[Fang Xiaoxiao] was angered by [Lin Jianqing]'s attitude and walked away quickly. [Lin Jianqing] realized he said the wrong thing and hurried to catch up with [Fang Xiaoxiao]. [Fang Xiaoxiao] was forced to stop. She looked up at [Lin Jianqing] coldly, with a very displeased expression.
1:41:9|1:41:15|[Lin Jianqing] spoke with his head down and in a low, pleading voice.
1:41:28|1:41:40|[Fang Xiaoxiao] looked at [Lin Jianqing] with a puzzled and confused expression. [Lin Jianqing] didn't know how to respond, sighed and said. He felt very powerless.
1:41:51|1:42:6|[Lin Jianqing] had tears in his eyes, seeking forgiveness from [Fang Xiaoxiao]. [Fang Xiaoxiao] took a deep breath and said firmly. [Fang Xiaoxiao] made up his mind not to forgive [Lin Jianqing] anymore, repeatedly pouring cold water on him, hoping to make him give up completely.
1:42:6|1:42:20|[Lin Jianqing] stood still, feeling powerless in the face of [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s indifference. [Fang Xiaoxiao] turned and walked away with graceful steps, showing no trace of nostalgia. At that moment, fireworks started to go off in all directions, their sound echoing through the sky.
1:42:20|1:42:35|[Lin Jianqing] stood still, his lonely figure appearing particularly isolated. He gave up struggling and let [Fang Xiaoxiao] leave once again. The scene shifted back to 2018, with the sky gradually brightening, and the snowy suburbs surrounded by silence.
1:42:35|1:42:49|In the distance, thick white smoke rises from the houses and factories. [Lin Jianqing] and [Fang Xiaoxiao] park the car in the snow, standing in front of it. Each holding a cigarette, they look ahead expressionlessly, silent for a moment before speaking.
1:42:50|1:42:58|The two of them chatted aimlessly, alleviating the loneliness of the journey.
1:43:18|1:43:23|[Lin Jianqing] returned to his hometown with his pregnant wife, and [Lin's Father] was already waiting at the train station.
1:43:27|1:43:33|The old [Lin's Father] is holding a white cane, his eyes are gradually losing the ability to see people clearly.
1:43:35|1:43:40|Lin's Father eagerly grabbed his daughter-in-law's hand, mistaking her for Fang Xiaoxiao, tears welling up in his eyes.
1:43:47|1:43:54|Lin Jianqing's wife was surprised to hear Lin's Father calling her Fang Xiaoxiao, then the two helped Lin's Father slowly leave the train station.
1:44:0|1:44:13|[Lin Jianqing] returned to reality with a mix of emotions in his heart, but his face showed no expression. The snow and ice on the road began to melt gradually. The two set off again, the car speeding through the snow, as the sun rose from the horizon, shining on the vast white land.
1:44:36|1:44:44|[Fang Xiaoxiao] sat in the passenger seat, leaning her head against the seat, staring out the window in a daze. After a long silence, she finally spoke.
1:44:53|1:45:10|[Lin Jianqing] had nothing to say, so he forced a awkward smile, looking ahead without speaking. The empty road only had a lonely car speeding forward. On both sides of the road were endless snowfields, connecting with the distant sky to form a world of ice and snow.
1:45:10|1:45:24|The car sped forward, passing through a snowy forest, and then arrived at the destination. The two arrived at an apartment building. [Lin Jianqing] got out of the car, opened the trunk, and [Fang Xiaoxiao] followed, helping to take her luggage out of the car.
1:45:25|1:45:41|[Lin Jianqing] helped [Fang Xiaoxiao] carry her suitcase to the entrance of the apartment building. [Fang Xiaoxiao] smiled and nodded, while [Lin Jianqing] turned and walked away. As he reached the car, [Fang Xiaoxiao] suddenly ran after him. He turned around in confusion to look at [Fang Xiaoxiao], then smiled and walked back to her side.
1:45:41|1:45:49|[Fang Xiaoxiao] also looked at [Lin Jianqing] with a smile in her eyes and said.
1:46:0|1:46:8|Fang Xiaoxiao's expression suddenly became melancholic. Lin Jianqing lowered his head and smiled, saying.
1:46:9|1:46:24|[Fang Xiaoxiao] looked at [Lin Jianqing] with a smile in her eyes, but sadness was hard to hide. [Lin Jianqing] opened his arms, took a step forward, and embraced [Fang Xiaoxiao]. The two held each other tightly, closed their eyes, and savored this moment of luxury.
1:47:12|1:47:30|There was no communication between them. [Lin Jianqing] returned home to sort out his father's belongings. He took out his father's photo from an iron box and carefully examined it in his hand, then meticulously searched through everything in the box. Besides a stack of recipes, he found a letter written to [Fang Xiaoxiao].
1:47:40|1:47:45|[Lin Jianqing] busied himself in the nagging of his wife, putting the wrapped sticky rice dumplings into the steamer.
1:47:45|1:48:2|[Fang Xiaoxiao] The room is filled with express delivery boxes from Beijing to Yaojiang, all addressed to Miss Fang. [Fang Xiaoxiao] sits at the table, under the desk lamp, taking out a train ticket from Beijing to Yaojiang town. Then, she skillfully stands on the chair and removes the light from the ceiling.
1:48:2|1:48:26|At this moment, the delivery man knocked on the door of [Fang Xiaoxiao]. [Fang Xiaoxiao] signed for the delivery, then she walked to the table and sat down, holding the package. It was an envelope. She took out the folded letter from the envelope and opened it under the light to read.
1:50:0|1:50:9|[Lin Jianqing] sat by the stove where [Lin's Father] often sat, lost in thought.
1:50:39|1:50:57|[Fang Xiaoxiao] watched silently as tears rolled down her face. The night of the Beijing New Year was bustling, with bright lights lining the wide streets. The distant lights in the buildings flickered like stars in the sky. Every household had couplets and "福" characters pasted on their doors, and red lanterns hung outside.
1:50:57|1:51:13|[Fang Xiaoxiao] sat at the table, with [Lin Jianqing]'s game on the computer screen. A large number of bullet comments appeared on the game interface, with countless netizens apologizing to the people they had missed in the past. [Fang Xiaoxiao] reached out her right hand and pressed the Enter key.
1:51:13|1:51:23|In the game, the little boy arrived in front of a snow-covered house, while on the other side of the road came a little girl, who was the girl Ian had been looking for, Kelly.
1:51:23|1:51:49|Ian and Kelly finally reunite at the end of the road. They look at each other, leaning happily together with smiles on their faces. In this moment, the game screen suddenly changes from grayscale to color. Fang Xiaoxiao looks at the computer screen, her eyes moistened, and a relieved smile appears on her face. At this moment, Fang Xiaoxiao's world finally regains its color.
1:51:49|1:52:4|Ian and Kelly walked side by side into the house, a dazzling light shining from the door of the house, illuminating the ground outside and instantly lighting up the whole world. At this moment, a line of text appeared on the screen,
