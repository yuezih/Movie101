0:0:53|0:0:59|After hearing this, [Jiang Haolong] reached out and took the bag of clothes from [Mandy]'s hand.
0:1:5|0:1:17|Suddenly a minibus crashed into [Jiang Haolong], [Mandy] was so scared that she covered her ears with both hands, her pupils dilated.
0:1:26|0:1:53|[Mandy] suddenly paused for a moment, then continued cutting vegetables. [Chen Qiang] glanced at her, still standing by the window hanging clothes. Suddenly losing balance, [Chen Qiang] tumbled out of the window and into a massage parlor. [Mandy] and Jimmy were sitting side by side on the sofa. [Mandy] turned her head, lowered her eyes, and thought for a moment.
0:2:5|0:2:10|His head tilted to one side, body unmoving, [Mandy] looked at him with a puzzled expression, reaching out to push him again, but he remained completely still.
0:3:18|0:3:30|[ Yu Chunjiao ] stood up, took a tissue in one hand, picked up the phone on the coffee table and started flipping through photos. She handed the phone with the photos to [ Zhang Zhiming ], who was drinking watermelon juice.
0:3:51|0:4:9|Ignoring [Zhang Zhiming], she walked away. Amidst their argument, the film title "Zhang Zhiming and Yu Chunjiao" appeared on the screen, with the sun shining brightly and the wind changing, the setting sun appeared exceptionally lonely against the backdrop of tall buildings.
0:4:10|0:4:34|On the night of July 27, 2009, the bustling streets of Hong Kong were brightly lit. [Zhang Zhiming], Gong Gong, Da Ge, and [Paul] sat in the bar. Paul took out his phone and played a recording. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and everyone looked at the phone, then turned to look at his sinister expression. Zhang Zhiming joked:
0:6:2|0:6:18|At this moment, with the street brightly lit and vehicles constantly passing by, the family of Yu Chunjiao sits in Joyful Restaurant. Yu Chunjiao looks embarrassed, while her mother, sitting in the middle, keeps yawning.
0:6:30|0:7:1|[Zhang Zhiming] returned home late at night, as soon as he opened the door, he called out to [Yu Chunjiao], but she didn't respond. He turned on the light and changed his shoes before heading towards the bedroom. Glancing at the living room on his way to the bedroom, he suddenly stopped and slowly leaned forward. He saw a birthday cake in a box on the table, smacked his lips, and casually put down his backpack. Meanwhile, [Yu Chunjiao] was focused on washing dishes in the kitchen. [Zhang Zhiming] cautiously walked up behind [Yu Chunjiao], who had just put down a washed dish. [Zhang Zhiming] gazed at her back.
0:7:4|0:7:20|[ Yu Chunjiao ] pouted while tidying up the dishes, [ Zhang Zhiming ] remained silent, his hands in his pockets, looking at the floor.
0:7:44|0:7:50|After she finished speaking, she turned around and picked up the bowls in the washbasin and placed them on the cupboard.
0:8:12|0:8:19|[Yu Chunjiao] looked up at [Zhang Zhiming] for a moment, [Zhang Zhiming] lowered his head and met her gaze, then [Yu Chunjiao] looked away.
0:9:1|0:9:27|In the evening, [Yu Chunjiao] and her girlfriends were sitting by the bay having barbecue. Isabelle was on the phone while [Yu Chunjiao] sat there with a worried look on her face. [Zhang Zhiming] walked over to them and sat directly next to [Yu Chunjiao]. He picked up [Yu Chunjiao]'s drink, took a sip, twisted the cap back on, and turned to [Yu Chunjiao], saying: He reached for a chicken wing.
0:9:36|0:9:59|[Zhang Zhiming] left with the chicken wings, while [Yu Chunjiao] continued to barbecue. As [Yu Chunjiao] turned around and saw [Zhang Zhiming] handing the chicken wings to someone else in the distance, her father-in-law immediately dodged away when he saw her approaching.
0:10:56|0:11:22|[Yu Chunjiao] turned around and touched her nose before leaving, [Zhang Zhiming] impatiently moved his mouth. In the evening, [Zhang Zhiming] came home, one hand on the doorknob, the other hand turning on the light. He turned around and saw a note on the dining table. He threw the keys on the cabinet in the hallway and slowly walked towards the dining table. The note on the table read: "I'm staying at my mom's house." Raindrops fell on the car window, [Yu Chunjiao] looked at the night scene outside the window.
0:11:22|0:11:37|The dim light of the night illuminated the gloomy mood of [Yu Chunjiao], while on the other side, [Zhang Zhiming] took a sip of beer at home and then put it down.
0:11:42|0:12:3|[Yu Chunjiao]'s mother's house upstairs was brightly lit, her phone received eight consecutive text messages. [Yu Chunjiao] was lying on the bed, just picking up her phone when her mother pushed the door open and sat beside her, placing her hand on her shoulder. In the living room, [Zhang Zhiming] heard [Yu Chunjiao]'s mother coming out and looked up at him.
0:12:47|0:13:7|[Zhang Zhiming] walked out of [Yu Chunjiao]'s house, with Auntie watching him leave. [Yu Chunjiao] leaned against the window and watched [Zhang Zhiming] getting into his car downstairs. [Zhang Zhiming] looked up at the building across the street before driving away. [Yu Chunjiao] stood alone behind the curtain, silent and motionless.
0:13:7|0:13:19|The next day, looking up at the sky, the weather was clear, with changing winds. The cigarette butt on the trash can was still smoking, and the unfinished tall building was swaying in the wind. November 22, 2009.
0:13:32|0:13:54|On the other side, under the bright sunshine, [Yu Chunjiao] held the leash and heard the phone ring. She took out her phone, glanced at it nervously, and answered the call. On the subway, [Zhang Zhiming] looked out the window. [Yu Chunjiao] walked slowly forward, while [Zhang Zhiming] licked his lips with his tongue. [Yu Chunjiao] remained silent.
0:14:11|0:14:25|[Zhang Zhiming] raised his head unnaturally, touched his cheek with his tongue, while [Yu Chunjiao] listened to the voice on the phone, tears filling her eyes.
0:14:27|0:14:35|[Yu Chunjiao] burst into tears as she listened, tears streaming down her cheeks.
0:14:55|0:15:17|After hanging up the phone, [Yu Chunjiao] shed tears. On the subway, [Zhang Zhiming] waited quietly for the next stop. Meanwhile, [Yu Chunjiao] walked down the stairs slowly with her dog. A plane flew slowly across the sky. The screen gradually went black, and subtitles appeared.
0:15:17|0:15:23|On October 15, 2010, it was the 421st day since Yu Chunjiao and Zhang Zhiming met.
0:16:23|0:16:30|The passenger nudged the flight attendant's buttocks with his elbow, and the flight attendant turned around.
0:16:43|0:17:8|The plane landed slowly, and several planes were parked on the vast tarmac. Inside the cabin, a flight attendant appeared with the crew and walked to the passengers. The passengers stood up and looked at [Zhang Zhiming] anxiously, quickly covering up for him.
0:17:48|0:17:55|[Zhang Zhiming] turned his head to stare at his father-in-law, who guiltily turned away and avoided looking at him.
0:18:4|0:18:18|As the father-in-law said, [Zhang Zhiming] is about to have a wonderful encounter with the sexy flight attendant. The car is speeding along, with tall buildings lining the sides of the road. At the red light, cars are queuing up on the street, with horns blaring incessantly.
0:18:18|0:18:44|In the apartment, [Zhang Zhiming] carefully placed a stack of books on the shelf with both hands, then turned around to squat on the floor to organize the items in the cardboard box. He took out a gift box and a cup and placed them on the floor, then picked up a small glass bottle. Pausing his actions, he unwrapped the packaging to find half a cigarette inside the small glass bottle, while hearing [Yu Chunjiao]'s words in his mind.
0:18:44|0:18:51|He brought the small glass bottle to his eyes, rotating it with his fingers, lost in memories.
0:19:19|0:19:23|[Yu Chunjiao] was so scared that she jumped onto the sofa with her eyes covered.
0:20:15|0:20:22|[Yu Chunjiao] shook her head, [Zhang Zhiming] burst into laughter, quickly covering his mouth with his hand.
0:22:12|0:22:26|After the flashback, [Zhang Zhiming] lowered his head and stared blankly. He looked at the glass bottle in his hand, stepped on the trash can, and expressionlessly lowered his head to see the trash can. He pinched the glass bottle, moved his foot away, turned around, and left.
0:22:26|0:22:44|Gazing up at the ever-changing sky, with cigarette butts still smoking on the trash can, [Yu Chunjiao] and party are in the alley behind, [Yu Chunjiao] holding a drink in hand, straw in mouth. The person next to her takes a puff of cigarette, hands the cigarette box to [Yu Chunjiao], who shakes her head.
0:22:54|0:23:14|[Yu Chunjiao], stay still. On the other side, the nightclub is filled with smoke, and the sexy women on the dance floor are twisting their waists and hips wildly. Men are laughing and flirting among them. Beside the dance floor, [Sam] is holding a beer, swaying his body as he walks towards the beautiful women.
0:23:28|0:23:35|Sam put his arm around the beautiful woman's shoulder and clinked glasses with her, then pushed her towards his friend.
0:23:42|0:23:48|In the blink of an eye, a group of people arrived at the restaurant, and the gentlemen kindly pulled out chairs for the ladies.
0:24:26|0:24:32|Late at night, the office building in Beijing was still brightly lit,
0:24:58|0:25:21|Continuing, [Zhang Zhiming] walked into a place called "Bed Bar" with his phone in hand, sighed softly, put the phone in his pocket, and walked in. The architectural style of the Bed Bar was somewhat retro, with classical music playing inside. [Shang Youyou] called out, sitting on the sofa. [Zhang Zhiming] walked in and sat down next to her.
0:25:32|0:25:40|[Zhang Zhiming] sat eating snacks, turned his head to look at [Shang Youyou], [Shang Youyou] aimed the camera at him and pressed the shutter. Stimulated by the flash, [Zhang Zhiming] turned his head to the other side.
0:25:50|0:25:56|[Zhang Zhiming] pursed his lips, then sat up and took a bite of a snack.
0:26:37|0:27:2|[Zhang Zhiming] reached into his pocket for money, and [Shang Youyou] saw something fall out of his pocket. She reached out, picked it up, and saw that it was a condom. [Zhang Zhiming] turned around and saw the condom in [Shang Youyou]'s hand. She held the condom and sighed. [Zhang Zhiming] looked at the condom in her hand with a hesitant expression, then awkwardly took it from her and put it back in his pocket.
0:27:3|0:27:26|Silently turning his face away, [Zhang Zhiming] put his hand in his pocket and slowly sat up from the sofa. He quickly turned his head to the other side, while [Shang Youyou] smiled even more brightly. [Zhang Zhiming] drank while looking at her, standing side by side with [Shang Youyou] in the crowd, watching the band performing in the middle. [Shang Youyou] held a bottle of wine in one hand, closing her eyes and immersing herself in the music.
0:27:26|0:27:46|[Zhang Zhiming] gently swayed his body with his head down, while the people around him were also swaying lightly to the music. [Shang Youyou] and [Zhang Zhiming] held hands tightly, immersed in the music. As the morning sun rose, shining on the towering buildings, several colleagues surrounded the crying Dora.
0:27:55|0:28:2|[Yu Chunjiao] glanced back at Dora, who was crying.
0:29:47|0:29:59|[Yu Chunjiao] looked up in surprise at E Jie, while [Zhang Zhiming] stood in front of the wall covered with photos at [Shang Youyou]'s house.
0:30:20|0:31:1|[Zhang Zhiming] nodded while eating, [Shang Youyou] propped up her chin, looking at him with a pleased smile. [Zhang Zhiming] covered his mouth with one hand, turned to look into [Shang Youyou]'s eyes. [Shang Youyou] handed him a cup of water and a tissue. [Zhang Zhiming] drank the water quickly without speaking, while [Shang Youyou] watched him with a smile.
0:31:9|0:31:30|Youyou once again lifted [Zhang Zhiming]'s face, and he stuck out his tongue. Youyou gently kissed the tip of his tongue, causing Zhang Zhiming to instantly feel a tingling sensation all over his body. He stared at her with his tongue out, and Youyou kissed his tongue tip again. Zhang Zhiming looked into her eyes, his restless heart unable to be contained any longer.
0:31:30|0:31:49|Following that, [Shang Youyou] took the initiative to approach [Zhang Zhiming], kissing his lips, gently sucking and nibbling softly, absorbing all the sweetness from his mouth. Gradually, [Shang Youyou] softened on the sofa, holding [Zhang Zhiming]'s hand with increasing strength, their breath quickening. With closed eyes, the two immersed themselves in the wonderful moment.
0:31:54|0:32:21|Outside the window, tall buildings stand, with green trees shading below. At this moment, at the exit of Beijing Airport, a group of flight attendants walk out carrying luggage. Inside the station, a crowd of people surges. Chen Jun and Xiao Juan hold up a sign for pick-up, looking towards the exit. They see [Yu Chunjiao] coming out, and [Yu Chunjiao] and Isabelle also see them. They wave and greet each other. Chen Jun warmly helps [Yu Chunjiao] with her luggage. Back at the hotel, [Yu Chunjiao] busily unpacks her luggage. She unintentionally notices a plastic bottle ashtray, picks it up, and stares at it.
0:32:21|0:32:37|Memories suddenly flashed back to the past, in the car [Zhang Zhiming] cut open a plastic bottle and inverted the top half into the bottom half to hand it to [Yu Chunjiao]. In the hotel, [Yu Chunjiao] sat in front of the mirror, took out a cigarette, held it in her mouth, and stared blankly at the lighter.
0:33:10|0:33:23|[Yu Chunjiao] turned her head in astonishment and saw [Zhang Zhiming], who was stunned. [Zhang Zhiming] nervously pursed his lips, while [Yu Chunjiao] used her hand to tidy up her wind-blown hair. [Zhang Zhiming] looked around.
0:33:29|0:33:38|I came to Beijing with Isabelle, [Zhang Zhiming] turned around, Shang Youyou with a career line around [Zhang Zhiming]'s arm, [Zhang Zhiming] felt a bit embarrassed.
0:34:19|0:34:26|Yu Chunjiao looked at Yu Chunjiao from a distance, and Zhang Zhiming turned to look at Yu Chunjiao.
0:34:30|0:34:51|The others looked at each other in silence. Isabelle turned around again to look into the distance, while Chen Jun pursed his lips and lowered his head.
0:35:12|0:35:19|Isabel shook her head in anger,
0:35:54|0:36:19|[Yu Chunjiao] stared at him in astonishment, picked up a straw without a word. In Zhongshan Park in Beijing, the square was filled with elderly people holding cardboard signs with words written on them, some even had photos attached, describing boys, girls, gender, age, and occupation. [Yu Chunjiao] walked away feeling despondent.
0:38:2|0:38:32|Later, [Yu Chunjiao] was arranged to meet a blind date at a restaurant. She touched the frame of her glasses with her nails painted black, while the man on the blind date smiled awkwardly with his head down. Startled, [Yu Chunjiao] choked on her milk tea and covered her mouth with her hand. Brenda, who was sitting not far away, saw them giggling. The man on the blind date awkwardly picked up his water glass. Meanwhile, [Zhang Zhiming] and [Shang Youyou] were taking a walk in the park.
0:38:32|0:38:42|The two walked hand in hand down the steps, back to the room. [Zhang Zhiming] was lying on the recliner reading a magazine. [Shang Youyou] snatched the magazine, placed it aside, and then lay on top of [Zhang Zhiming].
0:38:52|0:39:10|[Shang Youyou] heard crying and turned to look into the distance. [Zhang Zhiming] pursed his lips and nodded. Following [Zhang Zhiming]'s gaze, [Shang Youyou] saw into the distance again. In the blink of an eye, the two were back home. [Zhang Zhiming] poured dry ice into the toilet. After pouring the dry ice, the two squatted down to watch the reaction in the toilet. A gas slowly emerged from the toilet.
0:39:27|0:39:38|Shang Youyou tentatively asked, Zhang Zhiming gently touched the gas on the toilet with his hand, the two fell into silence. Through the glass window, the bustling and prosperous street under the night sky, Yu Chunjiao sitting alone by the window.
0:39:47|0:40:17|The warm and lively past of the two slowly drifted into Yu Chunjiao's mind. At the gathering, Zhang Zhiming took out his phone and looked puzzled at the blank message sent by Yu Chunjiao. The concise dialogue box floated on the phone screen, gently stirring Zhang Zhiming's emotions like willow leaves. Upon hearing the ringtone, Yu Chunjiao hurriedly opened her phone to check, as the sweet and playful music played.
0:40:18|0:40:32|[Yu Chunjiao] looked at the text message with a slight smile on her lips. The two of them started chatting without saying a word, [Zhang Zhiming] avoided [Shang Youyou] at the gathering, secretly replying to messages from [Yu Chunjiao] from time to time, while [Shang Youyou] remained completely unaware.
0:40:33|0:40:41|The lively atmosphere at the party seemed to quiet down at this moment, with [Zhang Zhiming] replying to messages while secretly observing the friends at the gathering.
0:40:48|0:41:12|[Yu Chunjiao] repeatedly pretended to flirt with [Zhang Zhiming], who couldn't resist and finally invited her for a late-night snack. [Yu Chunjiao] leaned back on the sofa, contentedly swaying, and said: "Just took a shower and feeling a bit tired." Testing [Zhang Zhiming], she received a direct response: "Meet in 20 minutes." [Yu Chunjiao] quickly tried on clothes in front of the mirror.
0:41:12|0:41:48|She carefully matched each piece, tried on one by one, looked at herself in the mirror, while [Zhang Zhiming] just got up, about to say goodbye and leave, [Shang Youyou] kissed his neck without anyone else around. In the elegant Hong Kong-style restaurant, [Zhang Zhiming] sat at the table and greeted [Yu Chunjiao] who walked over. [Yu Chunjiao] walked to the chair, took off her coat, revealing her sexy back.
0:41:52|0:42:5|Zhang Zhiming blinked in astonishment, while [Yu Chunjiao] elegantly sat down. Seeing Zhang Zhiming staring at her, he shook his head gently. [Yu Chunjiao] took the menu from the waiter and carefully examined it.
0:42:34|0:43:2|Teasingly, [Yu Chunjiao] joked with a hint of stubbornness towards Zhiming, who looked at her with confusion. After dinner, the two walked side by side on the street. A taxi drove past them, and Zhiming turned to look at the distant [Yu Chunjiao] with a sigh.
0:43:6|0:43:19|Upon hearing Yu Chunjiao say she wanted to go home, Zhang Zhiming became even more puzzled. He questioned Yu Chunjiao, who stared at him before turning to look behind her.
0:43:26|0:43:33|Zhiming felt a bit embarrassed and tried to cover it up with a smile. [Yu Chunjiao] quickened her pace and got into a taxi.
0:43:43|0:43:54|In the taxi, [Yu Chunjiao] turned her head to look ahead, leaving Zhiming alone in a daze. After a moment, Zhiming touched his lips before reacting and entered the living room.
0:44:14|0:44:31|Brenda carefully checks her makeup, takes out her phone and calls [Yu Chunjiao] not far away. [Yu Chunjiao] turns her head. She looks at Brenda, who looks displeased.
0:45:0|0:45:39|[Yu Chunjiao] finished speaking and walked towards the restroom holding her stomach. She walked through the glass corridor into the restroom, while Brenda continued to check her makeup at the table, completely unaware of the man in white slowly approaching behind her. Brenda turned her head to look at the man in white and nervously stood up. She slowly reached out her hand to shake hands with the man in white, who suddenly pulled back his hand. Brenda had to sit back down awkwardly, but her gaze never left the man in white.
0:45:47|0:46:1|In the bathroom, [Yu Chunjiao] was about to squat down when her phone unexpectedly fell into the toilet first. Glancing at it, she immediately pulled up her pants, picked up a nearby tool to try to fish out the phone from the toilet. Then she turned around to twist the toilet door handle, but after twisting it several times, there was no response.
0:47:44|0:47:50|Brenda looked up and thought for a moment. At this moment, [Yu Chunjiao] couldn't hold it anymore in the bathroom.
0:47:58|0:48:29|Sam deliberately diverted Yu Chunjiao's attention. Yu Chunjiao felt a bit embarrassed, lowered his head and dared not look at Brenda. He suddenly showed a surprised smile, and Brenda also smiled with him. Brenda shyly lowered her head and smiled lightly. In the restroom, Yu Chunjiao twisted the doorknob in pain. Finally, the staff outside quickly opened the door for her. Yu Chunjiao ran towards the men's restroom, while Brenda watched him wide-eyed.
0:48:37|0:49:9|Brenda nervously swallowed and slowly placed her hand on the table, trembling as she reached out to touch Ben's finger. Brenda seemed to tremble as if she had been shocked, retracting her finger, then trying to touch Ben's finger again. They both showed surprise on their faces, and finally their hands were fully held together, experiencing an unprecedented feeling. They held each other's hands tightly.
0:49:15|0:49:20|[Sam] immediately showed a surprised smile, the sunlight shining on [Sam]'s face, making it look particularly dazzling.
0:49:22|0:49:49|[Ben] stood up joyfully, while Brenda excitedly packed up the things on the table and put them into her bag. She put on her backpack and quickly got up. At that moment, Chunjiao hurriedly came out of the men's restroom. Sam, who was washing his hands, stopped her and gestured towards the bag next to the basin, where Chunjiao's phone was. Chunjiao picked up the bag and glanced at it. Sam made a please gesture, and the two walked through the corridor back to the cafe, only to find Brenda's seat empty. Sam looked around.
0:50:9|0:50:21|[Sam] looked at Chunjiao with a hint of suspicion, then walked to the front of the car. He took the initiative to open the car door for Chunjiao. She casually put down the plastic bag in her hand and made a phone call. As soon as [Sam] got in the car, he looked at her.
0:50:41|0:50:52|Yu Chunjiao returns the phone to [Sam], reaches for her own phone, opens the plastic bag, looks disgusted, [Sam] notices her actions,
0:52:12|0:52:19|In the glow of the setting sun, Yu Chunjiao and [Sam] sit on the grass, creating a scene that resembles a painting.
0:52:50|0:52:55|At the end of the forest, as the sun gradually sets, Yu Chunjiao sits in the car and fastens her seatbelt.
0:53:30|0:53:49|[Sam] nervously placed his hands on the steering wheel, while Chunjiao shyly looked out the window. The water on the road mirrored the ripples in [Sam] and Chunjiao's hearts. That day, Chunjiao walked into a restaurant while talking on the phone and looking around anxiously.
0:54:4|0:54:14|The two sat in a secluded corner of the restaurant, Chunjiao looked around, [Zhang Zhiming] took out a tablet from under the table, and Chunjiao opened the package directly.
0:54:20|0:54:33|Yu Chunjiao suddenly leaned in towards him and stared at him, and he also leaned in and stared back at Yu Chunjiao. Yu Chunjiao then put away the tablet on the table.
0:55:16|0:55:22|In the blink of an eye, we are in the living room of [Zhang Zhiming]'s house. [Yu Chunjiao] stands up while putting on clothes, and [Zhang Zhiming] is already dressed on the sofa.
0:55:33|0:55:50|[Yu Chunjiao] put on her coat and sat on the sofa, looking at [Zhang Zhiming]. [Zhang Zhiming] looked disappointedly elsewhere, pursed his lips and rolled his eyes, then turned to look at [Yu Chunjiao].
0:56:4|0:56:23|[Zhang Zhiming] lay on the sofa with a displeased expression, while [Yu Chunjiao] sat upright without looking at him. Both of them were lost in their own thoughts, and [Zhang Zhiming] suddenly sat up.
0:56:41|0:56:48|[Zhang Zhiming] frowned at [Yu Chunjiao],
0:57:30|0:57:41|The atmosphere in the room dropped to freezing point again. Angry [Yu Chunjiao] rubbed her nose and found blood on it. [Zhang Zhiming] quickly took out a tissue and handed it to [Yu Chunjiao].
0:57:45|0:58:10|[Yu Chunjiao] raised her nose and used a tissue to wipe the blood, while [Zhang Zhiming] gently bowed his head to massage the tiger's mouth for [Yu Chunjiao]. With [Zhang Zhiming]'s gentle movements, [Yu Chunjiao]'s heart gradually melted. Sensing [Yu Chunjiao]'s gaze, [Zhang Zhiming] felt a bit guilty and lowered his head.
0:58:10|0:58:13|[Yu Chunjiao] turned her head with tissue stuffed in her nostrils to look at [Zhang Zhiming],
0:58:21|0:58:27|[Yu Chunjiao] chuckled, and a piece of tissue fell out of her nostril, [Zhang Zhiming] looked at [Yu Chunjiao] with a mixture of anger and amusement.
0:58:50|0:59:8|[Yu Chunjiao] propped up her chin and looked at [Sam]. [Sam] noticed [Yu Chunjiao]'s gaze, glanced at his colleagues, and successfully made [Yu Chunjiao] laugh.
0:59:17|0:59:29|[Yu Chunjiao] sat up straight and picked up her phone to check messages, while [Sam] and her colleague continued working. [Yu Chunjiao] sent a text to arrange a meeting with [Zhang Zhiming] for the weekend.
0:59:31|0:59:36|With the cheerful music playing, several boats were floating on the lake in Chaoyang Park, Beijing.
1:0:46|1:0:51|[Zhang Zhiming] and Yi Jian sat side by side eating, [Zhang Zhiming] pointed to the food and said:
1:1:21|1:1:48|Speaking, Yu Chunjiao lowered her head, [Zhang Zhiming] nodded thoughtfully. Yu Chunjiao nodded and took a sip of porridge, she influenced me a lot, [Zhang Zhiming] looked at him in surprise, then started eating. The two fell into silence, [Zhang Zhiming] ate with his mouth full, awkwardly looking at Yu Chunjiao.
1:1:55|1:2:2|Yi Jian took a sip of beer, [Zhang Zhiming] looked at him. After a moment of silence, Yi Jian looked up at [Zhang Zhiming], nodded and smiled.
1:2:32|1:2:51|Yi Jian glanced over, [Zhang Zhiming] lost in thought. At this point, it was [Zhang Zhiming]'s turn to feel awkward. Yi Jian then raised an eyebrow at [Zhang Zhiming], who forced a smile and nodded. In the next moment, they both reached for a piece of green vegetable at the same time. Yi Jian politely picked up the vegetable and started eating.
1:2:58|1:3:3|[Zhang Zhiming] got up to see off Yijian. As soon as he sat down, he saw Yijian awkwardly smile.
1:3:22|1:3:29|Chang'an Street, brightly lit with flowing traffic, lights flashing, went out and waited,
1:3:39|1:3:46|Sitting by the window, [Yu Chunjiao] had a unique charm under the light. As soon as [Zhang Zhiming] opened the door, he saw Youyou.
1:4:3|1:4:24|Zhang Zhiming turned around, closed the door, looked at [Shang Youyou] awkwardly, thought for a moment, [Yu Chunjiao] still sat in the restaurant, waiting for [Zhang Zhiming] expressionlessly. She stared blankly out the window, finally couldn't help but pick up the phone. After [Zhang Zhiming] answered the phone, he hid in the bathroom with the tap running to take the call.
1:4:30|1:4:35|[Yu Chunjiao] heard [Shang Youyou]'s voice on the phone and hung up directly, sitting there in a daze.
1:4:42|1:4:54|Zhang Zhiming walked out of the restroom, while on the other side Yu Chunjiao and Sam were sitting together eating. Yu Chunjiao was eating noodles expressionlessly and absentmindedly, as if she didn't need the specially delivered food.
1:5:54|1:6:19|She choked back tears, as the night fell outside the window, enveloping the city in silence. Inside the car shop, [Zhang Zhiming] leaned against the window, carefully examining the interior of the car. After a moment of contemplation, [Yu Chunjiao] turned to look at him.
1:7:3|1:7:10|[Grandfather] turned to look at him,
1:7:29|1:7:55|[Zhang Zhiming] ignored [the father-in-law], and a week later, [Zhang Zhiming] drove to pick up [Yu Chunjiao]. [Yu Chunjiao] carried a large backpack on her back, and [Zhang Zhiming] considerately opened the car door for her. After seeing [Yu Chunjiao] seated, [Zhang Zhiming] started driving. He pretended to be clueless and said: "After looking at [Yu Chunjiao], he said:"
1:8:1|1:8:17|Yu Chunjiao and Zhang Zhiming arrived at the Great Wall Community in no time. They stopped in front of a bamboo house, with Yu Chunjiao walking into it joyfully, looking around in disbelief, while Zhang Zhiming lay on a recliner by the window.
1:8:23|1:8:30|Speaking, [Yu Chunjiao] jumped up the steps with a smile on her face, and then she walked over and lay down on the sofa.
1:8:54|1:9:0|[Yu Chunjiao] carefully brought the food to [Zhang Zhiming] wearing gloves, and when [Zhang Zhiming] smelled the fragrance, he widened his eyes.
1:9:19|1:9:32|[Yu Chunjiao] opened the bamboo door and smiled contentedly. She put her feet into the water under the bamboo house and sat down, feeling the coolness beneath her feet, enjoying this moment of tranquility. [Yu Chunjiao] subconsciously responded to [Zhang Zhiming].
1:10:15|1:10:22|[Yu Chunjiao] stood up and adjusted her pants leg, while [Zhang Zhiming] chewed on noodles and watched her walk away.
1:11:25|1:11:33|Back in reality, [Yu Chunjiao] slowly walks in the water.
1:11:43|1:12:7|[Zhang Zhiming] sat in the pavilion, quietly listening to [Yu Chunjiao] speak. [Yu Chunjiao] sat diagonally across from [Zhang Zhiming], who chewed on noodles and stirred the takeout box twice. [Zhang Zhiming] hesitated to speak, and [Yu Chunjiao], slightly angry, suddenly pushed open the bamboo door.
1:12:39|1:13:10|[Yu Chunjiao] ignored him and walked out, leaving [Zhang Zhiming] sitting in the pavilion, hugging his knees in frustration, watching her walk away. He sighed and turned his head as night fell, the bamboo house appearing lonely surrounded by tall trees. [Zhang Zhiming] was alone in the kitchen, talking on the phone, when he heard [Yu Chunjiao] coming out. He hung up and turned to look at her, noticing her serious expression.
1:13:18|1:13:32|[Zhang Zhiming] looked at the lowered head of [Yu Chunjiao]. [Yu Chunjiao] glanced at the floor, bit her lip, feeling a bit dissatisfied. [Zhang Zhiming] silently brushed past her, but she grabbed his arm at that moment, and the two of them locked eyes.
1:13:34|1:13:40|After a moment of eye contact, [Zhang Zhiming] turned his head slightly and hesitated.
1:14:6|1:14:46|Facing the question from [Zhang Zhiming], [Yu Chunjiao] once again lowered her head in dissatisfaction, then pursed her lips, raised her head, and held back tears. After a moment, she nodded with a pout, turned to look at [Zhang Zhiming]. [Zhang Zhiming] impatiently put his hands in his pockets. [Yu Chunjiao] kept her head down and did not look at him again. Outside the window, [Zhang Zhiming] drove away quickly. As night fell, in the bamboo house in the forest, only [Yu Chunjiao] was left, sorrowful by the window.
1:14:49|1:15:4|[Zhang Zhiming] returned home and sat on the coffee table, lowering his head nervously. He looked up at [Shang Youyou], who was staring into his eyes, trying to gauge his reaction. [Shang Youyou] had a serious expression on her face.
1:15:42|1:16:6|Shang Youyou was lying on Zhang Zhiming's lap, Zhang Zhiming looked down at her with a hint of guilt, while Yu Chunjiao walked with a backpack on her back, talking on the phone. The phone rang, Zhang Zhiming looked down at his phone, Shang Youyou hugged Zhang Zhiming's thigh tightly, tears welled up in Zhang Zhiming's eyes as he looked away.
1:16:7|1:16:20|Upon hearing [Shang Youyou]'s sobbing, [Zhang Zhiming] hung up the phone and [Yu Chunjiao] walked forward with a hint of disappointment.
1:18:18|1:18:35|Zhang Zhiming lowered his head to listen to the phone, while on the other end, Yu Chunjiao was in tears, trying hard to endure the pain.
1:18:41|1:19:16|Yu Chunjiao was feeling a bit bored, she once again put her phone to her ear to listen. Zhiming, who had just finished listening to the voicemail, had tears in his eyes as he looked up at the photo on the wall. Inside the carriage, Yu Chunjiao looked sadly out the window, Sam glanced back at her. Yu Chunjiao held back her tears and remained silent, just quietly looking out the window. Sam no longer disturbed her.
1:19:16|1:19:36|The car arrived at the destination, [Sam] parked the car at the entrance, unbuckled his seatbelt, turned off the car lights, and sat in the passenger seat while [Yu Chunjiao] remained silent. [Sam] turned to look at her, [Yu Chunjiao] lowered her head expressionlessly, seemingly brewing something in her mind.
1:19:54|1:20:5|[Yu Chunjiao] once again gathered up her courage and said, [Sam] smiled bitterly and replied, [Yu Chunjiao] looked at [Sam] in surprise after hearing his words.
1:20:15|1:20:28|Sam looked deeply into Yu Chunjiao's eyes. After a moment of silence between them, time passed, with car lights flashing on the streets of Beijing, crowds bustling, and KTV inside.
1:20:46|1:21:1|[Yu Chunjiao] awkwardly looked at Ben. Ben walked over to [Yu Chunjiao] holding Brenda's hand. [Yu Chunjiao] reached out to shake hands with Ben, but Ben withdrew his hand.
1:22:14|1:22:42|[Yu Chunjiao] picked up her phone and saw a new message from Zhang Zhiming asking why she didn't answer the phone. After some thought, she replied: [Yu Chunjiao] edited the message and sent it to him while pressing the send button. As she waited, Zhang Zhiming sent another message. [Yu Chunjiao] casually opened it, and shortly after, Zhang Zhiming appeared in the karaoke room.
1:22:42|1:22:48|[Yu Chunjiao] strode up to Zhang Zhiming's private room, paused for a moment, and then pushed the door open.
1:23:2|1:23:9|[Yu Chunjiao] looked at Zhang Zhiming innocently, as Zhang Zhiming lowered his head to apologize to [Yu Chunjiao]. She looked at him expressionlessly.
1:24:13|1:24:30|Zhang Zhiming's phone rang at an inappropriate time, making Yu Chunjiao turn her head angrily.
1:24:32|1:24:40|Zhang Zhiming looked at [Yu Chunjiao]. Yu Chunjiao got up angrily and left, she stopped and looked back.
1:24:47|1:25:15|Later, she turned around and left, leaving Zhiming standing alone in place. Zhiming stared blankly at the door, and on the big screen appeared a graceful and heroic beauty, [Yu Chunjiao], sitting in front of the screen, looking sad with a quiet expression on her face. She watched silently, with no other emotions on her face, lowering her eyes and pondering. On the big screen appeared a woman in a white suit.
1:25:15|1:25:22|On the screen, the song is about to start. [Yu Chunjiao] looks at the lyrics on the screen and picks up the microphone.
1:26:8|1:26:40|[Yu Chunjiao] sang a song, tears welled up in her eyes. Her friends behind her didn't notice anything unusual. She wanted to sing but closed her mouth. Her friends were immersed in their own joy, while [Yu Chunjiao] felt like her heart was being twisted by a knife. She finally couldn't hold back the tears, and they streamed down her face. On the other side, Zhiming was also holding back tears as he listened to [Yu Chunjiao]'s singing. In the blink of an eye, Zhiming was sitting on the balcony's hammock, staring at his reflection in the glass, lost in thought.
1:26:44|1:27:13|Youyou sat on the ground looking at him in a state of collapse. Zhiming took the phone, turned it over, and saw the three words "I love you" on the screen, smiling. Youyou listened and felt a bit flustered. Zhiming stared at the phone.
1:27:23|1:27:31|[Zhang Zhiming] looked at [Shang Youyou], the two of them locked eyes, [Shang Youyou] gazed at him earnestly.
1:28:3|1:28:12|[Zhang Zhiming] bent down, irritably flipping his hair.
1:29:40|1:29:54|[Zhang Zhiming] looked at [Shang Youyou] who was motionless. Suddenly, [Shang Youyou] picked up the camera and pressed the shutter. A photo fell down, [Shang Youyou] bent down to pick up the photo from the ground and looked at it. Then, mischievously smiled.
1:30:9|1:30:18|Youyou looked down at the photo, then lifted her head up, looking at Zhiming calmly, tears streaming down her face.
1:30:20|1:30:52|Zhiming breathed a sigh of relief, lowered his head slowly. At this moment, [Yu Chunjiao] carefully placed the cosmetics on the display shelf while holding a bag. The sudden arrival of a customer caught her attention. After confirming repeatedly, she walked up with a smile. The customer looked up and smiled at her.
1:31:27|1:31:33|[Yu Chunjiao] handed another eyeshadow to Wang Xinping, who looked up at [Yu Chunjiao],
1:32:26|1:32:38|Shortly after, [Zhang Zhiming] arrived at the cosmetics store where [Yu Chunjiao] was. He greeted Isabelle, and she questioned him. [Zhang Zhiming] remained silent for a moment.
1:33:0|1:33:6|At 9:00, [Zhang Zhiming] immediately reaches out his hand, looks at his watch, Isabelle looks at him, then nods and prepares to leave.
1:33:31|1:33:38|[Zhang Zhiming] stood still, Isabelle looked a bit anxious, and [Zhang Zhiming] finally reacted.
1:33:53|1:34:7|In the station, [Yu Chunjiao] and [Sam] sat side by side, lost in thought. [Sam] was working on his laptop while [Yu Chunjiao]'s phone suddenly rang. Seeing that it was a call from [Zhang Zhiming], she hung up directly, put down her phone, and in the taxi, [Zhang Zhiming] was anxiously making a phone call.
1:34:41|1:34:52|[Sam] put down the computer and stood up to leave, while [Yu Chunjiao] sat in the chair with her chin resting on her hand, lost in thought. As [Sam] walked away, the sound of [Yu Chunjiao]'s phone ringing filled the room once again.
1:34:57|1:35:4|After a moment of contemplation, she took out a tablet from her bag, placed it on her lap, and after some operation, she stopped her hands.
1:35:7|1:35:38|She stared at the tablet without blinking, as if everything around her had ceased to exist. Her expression was solemn, and as she continued to watch, tears started to well up in her eyes. With the music gradually rising, [Yu Chunjiao] completely broke down emotionally. She sat on the chair, crying like a child, tears falling from her eyes like beads on a broken string.
1:35:39|1:36:14|She looked around, listening to the music from the tablet, then lowered her head again with tears streaming down her face. She cried while watching, tears flowing like a floodgate had opened. At this moment, [Sam] came back with two cups of coffee. Seeing [Yu Chunjiao] crying alone, he paused. He walked past [Yu Chunjiao] and sat on the chair next to her, looking at the already tearful [Yu Chunjiao]. [Sam] put down the coffee in his hand, turned to face her, and fell into contemplation.
1:36:15|1:36:21|She hesitated to speak as she watched her crying.
1:36:31|1:36:49|[Yu Chunjiao] took a deep breath and exhaled, calming herself down, but tears still lingered on her cheeks. She looked at [Sam] with teary eyes, wanting to speak but hesitating.
1:36:59|1:37:8|[Yu Chunjiao] lowered her head bitterly, her emotions fluctuating once again.
1:37:21|1:38:4|[Sam] listened silently as [Yu Chunjiao] spoke. [Yu Chunjiao] held back tears and shook her head, looking at [Sam] as she spoke. She didn't let the tears fall in front of [Sam], instead she turned away. The two of them fell into silence, with [Sam] not saying a word. In the distance, the voice of a broadcaster could be heard.
1:38:5|1:38:20|The noise at the airport brought everything back to reality. [Yu Chunjiao] looked up at [Sam], who smiled back at her. Suddenly, he reached out and patted her head, causing [Yu Chunjiao], who was already crying, to cry even harder.
1:38:20|1:38:35|[Yu Chunjiao] put the laptop in her bag, then got up and left. [Zhang Zhiming] was still in the taxi at the train station. [Yu Chunjiao] pushed the suitcase with one hand and carried the bag with the other hand, walking forward with her head down.
1:38:35|1:38:44|[Zhang Zhiming] rushed into the station and quickly ran to the elevator in the lobby. He continued to sprint desperately in the elevator, as if racing against time.
1:38:44|1:38:59|Up on the second floor, he looked around anxiously, searching for [Yu Chunjiao] in the crowd, trying to identify her over and over again. Finally, feeling a bit defeated, he made his way to the entrance, holding onto a glimmer of hope as he waited for [Yu Chunjiao] to arrive.
1:38:59|1:39:14|At the moment when he was wavering and about to give up, he was stunned when he turned around, looking straight ahead with a gleam in his eyes.
1:39:18|1:39:36|On the other side of the road, [Yu Chunjiao] appeared pushing a suitcase and carrying a shoulder bag in the sight of [Zhang Zhiming]. [Zhang Zhiming] ran towards her, their eyes met, and tears welled up in their eyes instantly. They silently gazed at each other without saying a word.
1:40:54|1:41:6|The two looked at each other, [Yu Chunjiao] rolled her eyes, amused by [Zhang Zhiming]. [Zhang Zhiming] held her shaking head with both hands, pulled her into his arms, and hugged her tightly.
1:41:36|1:41:52|[Zhang Zhiming] walked ahead, pushing the luggage while his arm was around [Yu Chunjiao]'s shoulder. This is where the film commentary ends. Thank you for listening.
