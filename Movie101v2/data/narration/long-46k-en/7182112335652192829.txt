0:0:33|0:0:51|Accompanied by lively music, a cool-dressed handsome guy with a helmet rides a motorcycle speeding along the winding mountain road. The galloping speed accelerates his excited heartbeat. With a lofty demeanor, he looks down on everything, stepping on the motorcycle boot throttle, and all kinds of scenery instantly turn into clouds behind him.
0:0:54|0:1:10|The speed of Little Fire brought bursts of cool wind, blowing his screams behind him, and this wind also blew out the title of the film, "Waiting for You to Chase Me". Little Fire's screams still echoed in the mountains, as if the distant mountains and valleys were responding to him.
0:1:10|0:1:20|Suddenly, an off-road vehicle blocked Xiao Huo's path. The driver of the off-road vehicle, upon seeing the situation, slammed on the brakes. The people in the car struggled to get out, and after stopping the car, everyone in the off-road vehicle got out.
0:1:23|0:1:26|After bidding farewell to the group in the off-road vehicle, the young man arrived at the solitary shack.
0:1:57|0:2:1|[Jia Fupi] directly weakens the ability of military sticks to resist diseases, seriously affecting the normal growth of military silk.
0:2:7|0:2:25|The rhythmic drumbeats lead us to the square at the foot of the mountain. It turns out to be a group of aunties dancing square dance. On the other side of the square, there is a group of three people who have just come down the mountain in an off-road vehicle. The driver is holding a sign that reads, "Warmly welcome the technology special envoy to our village for guidance work."
0:2:25|0:2:27|After waiting for a long time, [Yao Darong] received a phone call.
0:2:57|0:3:7|[Liang Yan] looked helplessly into the distance, a BMW approaching. So [Liang Yan] led the villagers to run to the village entrance to greet it.
0:4:16|0:4:21|The young man was stunned to realize that the beauty he had encountered on the mountain earlier was actually the village chief.
0:4:52|0:4:54|Once the matter was hidden in the ingredients, it was revealed.
0:5:21|0:5:23|He is called [Yao Daxiong], who is my nephew.
0:5:40|0:5:42|This is our village party secretary [Yao Darong].
0:5:52|0:5:58|The next day, [Liang Yan] dressed up carefully and arrived at the village committee office building.
0:6:20|0:6:24|[Liang Yan] quietly walked into [Yuan Mengyao]'s office, walked softly to [Yuan Mengyao]'s desk and tapped on it.
0:7:15|0:7:17|The two of them walked up the mountain along the handrail.
0:7:25|0:7:28|The stream trickled through the mountains, and the two did not notice the figure of [Yao Daxiong].
0:7:32|0:7:48|After Liang Yan called out twice, the two suddenly heard faint singing coming from a distance, freezing in place for a moment. He reached out and patted Yuan Mengyao, and the two quickly searched for the source of the sound. On the other side, Liu Fang was sitting on a small slope in the woods at this time, holding a guitar and singing quietly, lost in her own world.
0:7:55|0:8:7|All things in the world are singing freely, as if the flowers, plants, and trees are all softly responding to it. He quietly feels the breath of nature, [Yuan Mengyao] and [Liang Yan] found [Yao Daxiong] along the song, slowly approaching him from behind.
0:8:7|0:8:20|Her artistic appearance now, in stark contrast to her previous idle appearance in the solitary shed, left a strong impact on both of them. [Yuan Mengyao] remained silent, while [Liang Yan] excitedly shook [Yuan Mengyao] and said.
0:8:26|0:8:30|[Yuan Mengyao] acted decisively, and the drenched [Yao Daxiong] shouted.
0:9:20|0:9:30|[Liang Yan] walked away gracefully. After [Liang Yan] had walked far, [Liang Yan] shyly handed the key to [Yao Daxiong]. After taking the key, [Yao Daxiong] stared at [Liang Yan] and asked.
0:10:46|0:10:49|In the morning, [Yuan Mengyao] came to bring food to [Yao Daxiong].
0:11:7|0:11:17|The door still hasn't opened. [Yao Darong] angrily bangs on the door, but [Yao Daxiong] opens it just in time, causing [Yao Darong] to crash heavily into the wall. [Yuan Mengyao] sets down the food, freezes upon seeing the magazine cover on the table, and then [Yao Daxiong] snatches the magazine away.
0:11:43|0:11:51|Daxiong turned around disdainfully and walked away. [Yuan Mengyao] gave [Liang Yan] a disdainful look, then returned to the office to massage Daxiong's arms.
0:12:46|0:12:53|She wants to develop a new type of heavy-duty technology. If successful, it can not only increase production capacity but also be environmentally friendly.
0:13:5|0:13:23|Daxiong pondered for a moment, then suddenly slapped and left. [Yuan Mengyao] shouted. At this moment, [Liang Yan] was cultivating mushrooms in the place where she played the guitar in the morning. Daxiong arrived and saw [Liang Yan] holding various reagents for an experiment, grumbling as he approached and asked.
0:14:1|0:14:7|God brought me here, Daxiong hurriedly drove away, approaching his [Liang Yan].
0:16:9|0:16:17|The village uncle angrily walked to where Yuan Mengyao was conducting experiments, still with coffee mushrooms.
0:16:33|0:16:50|[Liu Fang] was criticized by the village party secretary to the point of speechlessness, and she returned to her room dejectedly. The stream below the mountain kept flowing, and [Yuan Mengyao] came out of the office with a gloomy expression. After a moment of contemplation, she walked resolutely towards [Liu Fang]'s room. [Liang Yan] quietly watched from the side as [Yuan Mengyao] entered [Liu Fang]'s room to comfort her.
0:19:38|0:19:45|[Liu Fang] recalls the scene of seeing [Yuan Mengyao]'s cover photo for the first time in the magazine store.
0:19:55|0:20:1|[Liang Yan] eavesdropped outside [Liu Fang]'s room and heard [Liu Fang]'s confession to [Yuan Mengyao], looking disappointed.
0:20:35|0:20:52|[Yuan Mengyao] smiled at [Liu Fang] from behind and then left, leaving [Liu Fang] full of anticipation. Leaning against the door, [Liang Yan] lowered her eyes, while [Yuan Mengyao] was extremely excited, bouncing and walking on the bridge, thinking about [Liu Fang]'s confession.
0:23:42|0:23:58|The director's wife brought the meal to the table. In the evening, the square at the foot of the mountain was bustling. Accompanied by cheerful music, [Liang Yan] was dancing in the middle of the square dance group, shining brightly. [Liu Fang] quietly sneaked into the back row and took photos of the elderly people dancing in the square.
0:23:58|0:24:1|She slowly approached [Liang Yan], who also noticed her.
0:24:3|0:24:15|[Liu Fang] generously danced with [Liang Yan], and then playfully imitated [Liang Yan] by joining in the square dance. She struggled to keep up with the moves, while at that moment on the mountain, [Yuan Mengyao] knocked on the door of the Daxiong family.
0:24:34|0:24:37|Daxiong regretfully slapped himself in the face.
0:25:11|0:25:14|[Yuan Mengyao] was eating fruit nonchalantly, while Daxiong stood still, saying.
0:26:3|0:26:16|The next morning, the study group was getting ready to leave, but Daxiong kept nagging his younger brother, urging him with his eyes.
0:26:47|0:27:1|[Liu Fang] conducted on-site investigation alone in the mountains. She carried a agricultural produce testing device and a pole, walked through the deep mountains, arrived at the stream, took some stream water and put it into a test tube. Then she added some reagents in a measured manner and carefully placed the sampling tube.
0:27:1|0:27:13|Continuing on, [Yuan Mengyao] arrived at another experimental site, carefully removing the mushrooms on the mountain wall for a closer look. After collecting samples, she sat by the rushing stream to sketch, leisurely capturing the scenery of the mountains and waters before her.
0:27:14|0:27:21|In the adjacent overhanging building, [Yao Daxiong]'s mother is matchmaking with a young girl.
0:28:14|0:28:26|[Yao Daxiong]'s mother squinted her eyes, with a cold expression, but Liu Fang was completely unaware. She looked satisfied at her landscape painting, and with great interest, added a few strokes to draw the face of [Yuan Mengyao].
0:29:46|0:29:58|[Yuan Mengyao] approached Liu Fang and helped her blow her eyes. [Yao Daxiong]'s younger brother took out his phone and captured this scene. In the eyes of [Yao Daxiong]'s younger brother, the actions of the two were overly intimate, as if [Yuan Mengyao] had taken the initiative to kiss Liu Fang's cheek.
0:30:13|0:30:28|[Yuan Mengyao] was half skeptical, but was amused by Liu Fang. [Yao Daxiong]'s younger brother ran away, while [Yao Daxiong] was still in training. Currently, there are over a thousand known edible mushroom species, with dozens of them successfully cultivated artificially.
0:30:36|0:30:38|[Yao Daxiong] hurriedly ran to the door to answer his little brother's phone call.
0:31:0|0:31:9|The small bridge in the mountain village shimmered with the sunlight, and the forest on the mountain looked like a canopy with branches and leaves spreading out.
0:31:25|0:31:45|Liu Fang seemed to be enveloped in a thin mist, outlining the shape of the daylight and painting the landscape in front of her. She then picked up her camera and examined the soil conditions under the leaves. Daxiong hurried back to the village due to a misunderstanding with his younger brother, who was anxiously waiting under the big tree at the village entrance.
0:31:45|0:31:48|Yao Daxiong happily walked up to his younger brothers from a distance.
0:32:17|0:32:22|In the spiritual land, Yuan Mengyao, the military girl whose planting failed, shouted in disappointment.
0:34:12|0:34:18|[Yuan Mengyao] held Daxiong's hand and pleaded, while [Liang Yan] behind them was deeply moved.
0:34:27|0:34:31|Later, [Yuan Mengyao] arrived at the village chief's house, where the village chief poured out the remaining water in the basin.
0:35:55|0:35:58|[Yuan Mengyao] arrived at [Yao Daxiong]'s house, and [Yao Daxiong]'s mother ran downstairs to open the door.
0:36:25|0:36:32|After [Yuan Mengyao] left, [Yao Daxiong]'s mother happily called [Yao Daxiong] on the phone, and his younger brother answered the call.
0:37:3|0:37:13|Daxiong left the field, and [Yuan Mengyao] was waiting for him on the roadside. However, Daxiong went to a clothing store to buy new clothes, and he put on a suit jacket, but he was still somewhat dissatisfied.
0:37:27|0:37:33|Finally, [Yao Daxiong] appeared in a dazzling suit jacket, quietly standing behind [Yuan Mengyao].
0:38:10|0:38:23|[Yuan Mengyao] headed towards the motorcycle that had just zoomed past, as his henchmen walked up behind [Yao Daxiong] and asked. A young man rode by on a motorcycle in a flash.
0:38:25|0:38:36|[Yuan Mengyao] took a shortcut from the other side, and the motorcycle stopped next to a girl. The young man took off his helmet and got off the bike, speaking to the girl standing under the tree. [Yuan Mengyao] seemed lost in thought.
0:45:29|0:45:34|[Yuan Mengyao] is embarrassed and angry, while [Yao Daxiong] is celebrating with his buddies at the restaurant.
0:46:13|0:46:23|[Yuan Mengyao] strode over angrily, [Yao Daxiong] was so scared that he dared not drink, and two henchmen patted [Yao Daxiong] on the shoulder and hurriedly ran away. The two fled in panic, not daring to look at [Yuan Mengyao].
0:46:23|0:46:30|[Yuan Mengyao] glared angrily at [Yao Daxiong], who was just starting to get drunk and awkwardly smiled at [Yuan Mengyao] with a red face.
0:46:46|0:47:5|Daxiong, fueled by alcohol, downed another glass before continuing. Nervously pursing his lips, [Yuan Mengyao] froze in surprise; he hadn't expected Daxiong to be so serious. Daxiong sighed, poured himself another glass, and [Yuan Mengyao] lowered her head.
0:47:42|0:48:1|[Yuan Mengyao] got up and left, while the younger brothers quietly watched Daxiong at the door. Daxiong, feeling miserable, drank heavily to swallow his sorrow. In another misty place, [Liang Yan] was sketching in the mountains and forests. Facing the woods, she focused on painting the scenery on the canvas without distraction. With skillful strokes, her inner peace was boundless.
0:48:1|0:48:4|Before long, Yao Daxiong also arrived in the woods.
0:48:23|0:48:32|[Liang Yan] put down the brush in her hand, glanced at Daxiong, then looked ahead. With a determined look, she picked up the drawing board, stood up, and gazed firmly at Daxiong.
0:49:3|0:49:12|[Yuan Mengyao] is in the backstage dressing room, arranging the clothes on the hangers. She has her back to the door frame, completely unaware of Daxiong quietly approaching behind her.
0:49:12|0:49:26|Daxiong quietly entered the room, hiding behind the clothes rack next to [Yuan Mengyao]. He closed his eyes, praying devoutly, rehearsing the words he wanted to say, nervously patting his chest, afraid that [Yuan Mengyao] would discover him early.
0:49:26|0:49:33|At this moment, [Yuan Mengyao] happened to be leaving with a piece of clothing, while [Liang Yan] walked past the clothes rack holding a stack of clothes, with their backs facing Yao Daxiong.
0:49:39|0:49:47|Daxiong knelt down on one knee in front of Liang Yan behind the clothes rack.
0:50:12|0:50:25|Daxiong looked up and saw [Liang Yan]. They both looked at each other in shock, Daxiong frowned in distress, almost on the verge of tears. Mrs. Liu, on the other hand, lived in a remote place, staying in the mountains and forests, cultivating edible fungi.
0:50:28|0:50:43|Under his meticulous research and careful cooking, the stones on the tree canopy emitted twinkling lights. These twinkling lights were the result of his hard work and dedication. In an instant, the stones rose up into the sky one by one, floating in the air like a dream.
0:51:7|0:51:22|Liu Fang turned her head in excitement, and in a split second, she was stunned in place. It turned out to be [Yuan Mengyao] in an elegant and pure wedding dress, walking towards her in a dreamy radiance. She was amazed, with a happy smile on her face, and then she also walked towards [Yuan Mengyao].
0:51:26|0:51:49|The two of them had clear and determined eyes, full of hope as they walked towards each other, surrounded by a shining army of practical soldiers. The shining army added a lot of sacred atmosphere to the scene as the two of them stood solemnly. [Yuan Mengyao] smiled gently, a slight tilt of her head that was captivating.
0:51:49|0:51:53|She blushed and lowered her head under the gaze, then Liu Fang spoke.
0:51:59|0:52:3|[Yuan Mengyao] scratched Liu Fang with foxtail grass, causing Liu Fang to wake up from the dream with a sneeze.
0:52:56|0:52:59|[Yuan Mengyao] threw away the dog tail grass and stood up.
0:53:46|0:53:50|And at this moment, [Yao Daxiong] is in the restaurant.
0:54:44|0:54:55|[Yuan Mengyao] was puzzled, looking at [Yao Daxiong] upon hearing these words, lowering her arm. [Yao Daxiong]'s two henchmen were still watching from the side, and [Yuan Mengyao] had a sudden inspiration to pay respects to her ancestors.
0:55:14|0:55:21|Watching the resolute figure of [Yuan Mengyao] walking away, [Yao Daxiong] regretted messing up another big thing, as his younger brothers ran out.
0:55:34|0:55:47|Yao Daxiong crazily sprayed the secret weapon perfume given by his henchman, only to attract a charging big dog. The big dog chased after Yao Daxiong, frightening him into fleeing in panic through the village.
0:55:50|0:56:9|He ran swiftly under the stage, with the dog chasing after him. Then he ran onto the stage, and the big dog followed, causing chaos on the stage. In the confusion, he hid behind everyone and ran up to the backstage loft from the stage, with the big dog still chasing after him.
0:56:9|0:56:17|He ran into the backstage and closed the door, hiding the big dog outside. When he turned around, he saw [Liang Yan], a Peking opera actress, changing costumes.
0:56:21|0:56:29|He entered the living room, empty-handed, and the women threw costumes at him. He was hit all over and couldn't see clearly around him.
0:56:40|0:56:55|[Yao Daxiong] looked down and found a bra hanging on his arm. As a result, the girls went crazy attacking [Yao Daxiong]. Late at night, the girls were rehearsing on stage. Meanwhile, the aunties were chatting below the stage. [Liu Fang] was taking photos of the girls on the side, following the script.
0:57:14|0:57:32|[Liang Yan] dances confidently on the stage, rehearsing late into the night. [Liu Fang] rides a motorcycle to take her home, and the bike sways on the bumpy bridge. Suddenly, [Liang Yan] loses balance, hits the brakes, and injures her leg. [Liu Fang] gets off the bike and asks, "Are you okay?"
0:57:32|0:57:36|[Liu Fang] knelt beside the injured [Liang Yan], while [Yuan Mengyao] watched from a distance.
0:57:39|0:57:44|[Yuan Mengyao] saw the two men's easy movements and quickly walked up to ask.
0:58:32|0:58:51|The next morning, [Liang Yan] carefully applied makeup in front of the mirror. Afterwards, she dressed up and arrived at [Liu Fang]'s house holding a bouquet of flowers. [Liang Yan] nervously entered [Liu Fang]'s house.
0:58:51|0:58:58|[Liang Yan] walked into the room and saw that [Liu Fang]'s bed was piled with clothes, books, and magazines. However, [Liu Fang] was not there.
0:59:1|0:59:14|She then puzzledly placed the bouquet on the table, and then excitedly picked up a coat on [Liu Fang]'s bed, shyly and excitedly embroidered it, then hung the coat on the hanger, humming a tune while dragging it on the floor.
0:59:14|0:59:26|[Liu Fang]'s room was quickly transformed, and she was sweating profusely after cleaning it. She took a deep breath, leaned the mop to the side, fanned herself with her hand, and then took out her phone from her pocket and walked into the bathroom.
0:59:28|0:59:32|The phone is placed on the table, playing cheerful music, while [Yuan Mengyao] is taking a shower in the bathroom.
0:59:49|1:0:4|He carefully cleaned his body and enjoyed the warm bath. Just then, [Liu Fang] finished the experiment and came back with a detector. As soon as he entered, he heard the sound of water in the bathroom and opened the door in surprise. [Liang Yan] in the bathroom happened to turn her head.
1:0:4|1:0:14|The moment their eyes met, Liu Fang stood still, [Liang Yan] turned pale, and screamed in shock. Liu Fang ran off without looking back, leaving the door wide open, shouting as she ran.
1:0:21|1:0:29|[Yuan Mengyao] rushed into Liu Fang's room anxiously, and saw [Liang Yan] hiding in the corner with a frightened look while taking a shower. She was startled and quickly ran out of the room to question Liu Fang.
1:0:55|1:0:57|[Yao Daxiong] received a phone call at the bar.
1:1:54|1:2:4|[Yuan Mengyao] closed the door tightly, leaving Liu Fang blocked outside, feeling frustrated and unable to explain. The distressed Liu Fang stood in stark contrast to the excited Daxiong.
1:2:18|1:2:32|The younger brother's face instantly darkened, while Daxiong smiled brightly. Men and women were moving their bodies in the dance floor, dancing vigorously to the music, but Liufang was in silence in the village party secretary's office. The village party secretary leaned on the table and asked.
1:3:24|1:3:28|Village scholar left, [Liang Yan] bowed her head in repentance, then went to Mengyang's house to go to the capital to confess her sins.
1:3:41|1:3:50|The villagers are all watching Liang Yan's jokes. Mengyao comes out to look after the door, and Liang Yan sees a glimmer of hope.
1:4:22|1:4:42|[Liang Yan] chased to the roadside, but failed to catch up with Mengyao. There were pebbles in [Liang Yan]'s shoes, so she took them off and poured out the sand. Her actions were very comical, and Yao Daxiong and his little brother laughed at her on the side. The little brother danced and imitated [Liang Yan], making her movements suddenly eerie.
1:4:45|1:4:54|Daxiong, worried, went to rescue with his younger brother. He accidentally hit Liang Yan's head with a stick, causing her to release the electric pole she was holding onto and faint on the ground.
1:4:55|1:5:6|Later, [Liang Yan] was taken to the hospital and admitted to a ward. Mengyao stayed by her side, carefully taking care of her and gently feeding her water. After taking a few sips, [Liu Fang] shook her head lightly.
1:6:34|1:6:48|[Yuan Mengyao] gently feeds oranges to [Liu Fang], under the bright sun, the village and the stream merge into one. [Liu Fang] takes [Mengyao] running on the bridge. [Liu Fang] swings her coat, excitedly shouting and jumping.
1:6:50|1:6:53|[Yuan Mengyao] ran behind, excited.
1:6:59|1:7:5|On a day of unpredictable changes, a shadow was cast over Chongshan.
1:7:57|1:8:3|[Yuan Mengyao] knelt beside [Liu Fang] with an umbrella, holding her tightly. The two accompanied each other on a cold rainy night.
1:8:5|1:8:19|The next morning, [Liu Fang] packed up her luggage and prepared to leave the village. As she walked out, she looked back at her room with reluctance. [Yuan Mengyao], dressed in a cool and casual outfit, stood at [Liu Fang]'s doorstep, leaning against a motorcycle, waiting for [Liu Fang].
1:8:19|1:8:26|[Liu Fang] was engrossed in the room and didn't notice [Yuan Mengyao]. When [Yuan Mengyao] saw [Liu Fang] coming out, she spoke up and asked.
1:8:44|1:8:51|[Liang Yan] walked gently towards [Liu Fang], who avoided eye contact.
1:8:53|1:9:1|Liu Fang looked at [Yuan Mengyao], then turned away. [Yuan Mengyao] smiled and took out a bank card.
1:9:8|1:9:11|[Yuan Mengyao] pulled Liu Fang's hand and handed the bank card to her.
1:9:20|1:9:30|Liu Fang grabbed [Yuan Mengyao] who was about to leave. In the midst of [Yuan Mengyao]'s confusion, Liu Fang pulled her into his arms and held her tightly. After a moment of contemplation, Liu Fang whispered softly in [Yuan Mengyao]'s ear.
1:9:33|1:9:53|The two embracing each other tightly looked so beautiful. Shortly after, Liu Fang regained her previous vitality. She carried a backpack to the experimental forest, where she saw the dense trees on the distant mountains and the vibrant land in front of her. Eager and full of energy, she carefully placed the experimental box down and respectfully bowed towards the forest.
1:11:4|1:11:23|Daxiong arrived at the dam, with a box at his feet. He leaned against the railing, waiting for Liufang. When Liufang arrived and asked Daxiong a question, he didn't answer. Instead, he bent down, opened the box at his feet, and took out some old worn-out items.
1:11:28|1:11:31|Recalling countless memories, he sighed as he watched and spoke.
1:12:38|1:12:54|Daxiong lowered his eyes sadly and put down his arms, but Fang Liu looked up confidently and said to him. Daxiong stared at [Liang Yan], stood up and helplessly said to him.
1:13:3|1:13:15|[Liang Yan] turned her head to look into the distance. Daxiong looked pained, but pretended to be strong and tried to calm his emotions. After great effort, he squeezed out a smile towards [Liang Yan] and said in a forced calm manner.
1:13:15|1:13:35|[Liang Yan], I beg you, the pleading tone of Daxiong made [Liang Yan] feel even more painful. [Liang Yan] seemed to be sulking, turning her head away from him. There used to be deep rivers in [Liang Yan]'s eyes. Seeing this, Daxiong's expression returned to a look of desolation.
1:13:35|1:13:47|After adjusting his state, he bent down to put the items back in the box, and then, with heavy steps, he walked away. [Liang Yan] watched Daxiong leaving alone with the box, feeling sorry but helpless in her heart.
1:13:48|1:14:12|[Liang Yan] leaned on the railing, looking at the river with clear eyes, yet hidden emotions flickered in the depths of her eyes. She pondered alone on the dam for a long time. In the evening, [Yuan Mengyao] arrived at [Liang Yan]'s house and knocked on her door. [Liang Yan] hesitated for a moment but still didn't open the door, her mind filled with countless thoughts as she leaned against the door.
1:14:30|1:14:47|[Yuan Mengyao] didn't think much about it, although she felt strange in her heart. She left disappointedly with a stack of documents. Hearing the footsteps of [Yuan Mengyao] leaving, Liu Fang finally came to the desk with relief, heavily crossing out the column of mountain troops on the military package summary. However, her inner turmoil remained unsettled.
1:14:47|1:14:54|Later, she tore off the statistics form, threw the process team to the ground, but [Yao Daxiong]'s earnest words echoed in her ears.
1:15:8|1:15:18|Liu Fang picked up the magazine with [Yuan Mengyao]'s photo on the cover on the table, and emotions surged in her heart for a moment. She opened her phone, hung up the call she was about to make to [Yuan Mengyao], and thought for a long time.
1:15:20|1:15:33|So he went outside to clear his mind, but his thoughts remained chaotic. As he walked, he unexpectedly arrived at the doorstep of [Yuan Mengyao]'s house. He hesitated, even dared not to look up, but caught a glimpse of [Yuan Mengyao]'s room lights being turned off.
1:15:33|1:15:41|The dimmed lights were like the disappointment in Liu Fang's heart at this moment. He sighed helplessly and then left [Yuan Mengyao]'s home. Reluctantly, he kept turning back every three steps.
1:15:46|1:15:53|The next morning, Liu Fang arrived at the mountain forest as usual to paint. She heard [Yuan Mengyao]'s voice and turned around in surprise.
1:16:7|1:16:17|Without a response from [Liu Fang], [Yuan Mengyao] felt a bit disappointed. She walked to the experiment site, but did not see [Liu Fang]. She looked around and noticed the swinging hammock and the boiling coffee.
1:16:18|1:16:23|So he shifted his gaze to the tree not far away and saw Liang Yan's sketchpad.
1:16:29|1:16:42|Although feeling sad, he still put down the lunchbox and walked away desolately. [Liu Fang] saw the back of [Yuan Mengyao] leaving alone behind the tree, feeling guilty, but she couldn't overcome the barrier in her heart and never dared to face [Yuan Mengyao].
1:16:44|1:16:57|In the midst of bird chirping, a car drove to the village entrance, and a stylish long-haired girl stepped out of the car. The girl walked towards the village but didn't know the way. A villager approached her, and the girl asked for directions.
1:17:2|1:17:8|Oh, the girl arrived at [Liu Fang]'s house and looked at the shelves filled with military models, asking in surprise.
1:17:20|1:17:31|Facing the gentle breeze and perfect sunlight, the girl arrived at the riverside, guided by [Liu Fang], who introduced the village to her. Later, [Liu Fang] also took the girl to the lake and mountains to ride a boat, when suddenly the girl spoke up.
1:18:2|1:18:7|Liu Fang took Yuan Mengyao to enjoy the mountains and water, both of them were very happy. They returned to Liu Fang's home and ate watermelon.
1:18:35|1:18:43|This is the village chief of Baishanzu, Yuan Mengyao. Yuan Mengyao looked flustered as she watched Liu Fang holding hands with the girl, and it took her a while to respond.
1:18:56|1:19:20|Yuan Mengyao turned around sadly, while Liu Fang patted the girl's thigh. Yuan Mengyao, upon seeing this, left angrily. Liu Fang gave the girl a thumbs up. After a while, Yuan Mengyao passed by Liu Fang's room holding materials and heard the commotion.
1:19:29|1:19:51|[Yuan Mengyao] remembered the materials on the box and left angrily. Liu Fang walked out the door with her arm around the girl. [Yuan Mengyao] saw the two of them in the office and called Liu Fang back.
1:20:19|1:20:43|Yuan Mengyao turned and left in sadness, then angrily returned to the office. Liang Yan stood still in shock, unable to speak, and she went back to her room feeling frustrated. Both of them were upset. Suddenly, Liang Yan rushed out of the room and shouted at Yuan Mengyao.
1:21:1|1:21:10|The small fish pond in Sun Zhishu's home reflected Yao Daxiong's sorrowful face. Daxiong stared at the pond motionlessly, lost in thought. Sun Zhishu, filled with worry, asked with concern.
1:21:56|1:22:1|Yao Daxiong finally revealed a genuine smile from the bottom of his heart.
1:22:36|1:22:40|Liu Fang grew a lot after listening to the teachings of the expert from the Agricultural Science Institute.
1:22:58|1:23:1|The crowd bid farewell to Yuan Mengyao reluctantly as they visited the construction site of the mushroom farm.
1:23:26|1:23:28|[Liu Fang] walked up to Daxiong and grabbed him.
1:23:44|1:23:51|[Liu Fang] arrived at the village party secretary's office, bringing several bags of folders. The village party secretary asked.
1:24:38|1:24:45|Liu Fang bid farewell to Village Scholar in a casual manner, leaving Village Scholar with a deep sense of reluctance as he watched [Liu Fang] walk away.
1:24:45|1:25:6|That day, [Yuan Mengyao] passed by a clothing store in the county town. Looking through the glass window, she was surprised to see the girl she had played with last time trying on a wedding dress. However, the man standing opposite her was not [Liang Yan]. [Yuan Mengyao] felt puzzled and rushed into the store.
1:25:15|1:25:20|[Yuan Mengyao] suddenly realized, happily thanked the girl and left.
1:25:52|1:26:7|[Yuan Mengyao] held the results left by [Liu Fang], listening to the village chief's words with tears in her eyes. The village chief quietly left the office, and after [Yuan Mengyao] saw her leave, she was alone in the office picking up the drawing paper left by [Liu Fang].
1:26:7|1:26:13|After opening the scroll, she found that the most prominent position on the scroll was a painting of her wearing a wedding dress by [Liang Yan].
1:26:14|1:26:26|[Yuan Mengyao] was deeply moved, tears streaming down his face at the thought of all that [Liu Fang] had done for him silently. Meanwhile, [Liu Fang] was unaware, observing the tea farmers picking tea leaves in the mountain tea garden.
1:26:28|1:26:46|The tea plantation appears solemn, dignified, and magnificent under the sky. The tea farmers are scattered on the mountains, diligently picking fresh tea leaves. [Liang Yan] walks on the path, holding a camera to record, preparing for a new experiment. She still feels lonely, even though there are countless people in the tea plantation, it is not as good as the company of [Yuan Mengyao] alone.
1:26:58|1:27:10|[Yuan Mengyao]'s call echoed in the valley, but [Liang Yan] was far away in the sky. [Liang Yan] walked alone on the bridge, and in a trance, she heard [Yuan Mengyao]'s call.
1:27:24|1:27:40|The call of [Yuan Mengyao] seemed to pass through the valley, gather along the stream into the river, and reach the ears of [Liang Yan] at the bridge. [Liang Yan] looked up to search, [Yuan Mengyao] was still shouting.
1:27:46|1:27:50|[Liang Yan] closed her eyes, feeling the direction of the sound, and looked back.
1:28:1|1:28:21|[Liang Yan] and [Yuan Mengyao] were both eagerly searching for each other and finally met. In the moment their eyes met, they ran towards each other, with indescribable happiness in their eyes. The young couple, reunited after a long separation, cherished each other immensely. They stopped their running steps, slowly moving forward step by step, with firm and unwavering footsteps.
1:28:22|1:28:34|They looked at each other firmly and tenderly, cherishing this rare encounter. [Yuan Mengyao] smiled with eyes full of love about to overflow. [Liang Yan] was thrilled to see [Yuan Mengyao] and asked eagerly.
1:29:19|1:29:37|[Liang Yan] teased [Yuan Mengyao] by lifting her up horizontally. [Yuan Mengyao] exclaimed in surprise for a moment, and then both of them smiled happily. [Liang Yan] excitedly spun around while holding [Yuan Mengyao], and the loving couple finally became husband and wife. It turned out that after the long-awaited reunion, what they brought was a lifetime of joy together.
