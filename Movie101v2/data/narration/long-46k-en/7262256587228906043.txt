0:0:57|0:1:15|Although it is already spring, the trees are still bare without a single leaf. A young woman in a cheongsam is slowly walking along a path overgrown with weeds, carrying a basket. The surroundings are in ruins, with the once sturdy city walls made of stone bricks having long lost their former imposing presence.
0:1:16|0:1:29|Now, only the broken walls are left struggling to support, like an old man guarding the city tremblingly. Under the hard branches, this broken path appears even more lifeless, as if spring has never visited here.
0:1:29|0:1:41|In a quick cut, in a small courtyard, a clean-shaven man in a robe struggles to move a plaque from a corner filled with clutter, and hangs it on a pillar on the side.
0:1:41|0:1:59|The strenuous movements caused the neatly arranged wood in the corner to scatter, making a loud noise as it fell to the ground. However, the man paid no attention to the scattered wood, focusing only on the task at hand. His movements were awkward, with occasional coughs interrupting his otherwise skilled actions, making him look quite disheveled.
0:1:59|0:2:6|Although the courtyard may look a bit dilapidated now, upon closer inspection, whether it's the carved veranda in the yard or the exquisite pavilion, they are all very exquisite.
0:2:7|0:2:22|In the distance, the sound of a train whistle suddenly came. [Zhou Yuwen] looked surprised in the direction of the whistle, but still did not put down the fire in her hand. At the same time, at the train station, a train slowly stopped at the platform, and a man in a suit stepped down from the train.
0:2:22|0:2:32|He was wearing a three-piece suit, holding a suitcase in each hand. After getting off the car, he looked around and then walked briskly towards the small path on the left. He moved with ease, showing no signs of fatigue from a long journey.
0:3:11|0:3:26|The wind chime hanging at the entrance of the pharmacy swayed with the wind, making a clear and pleasant sound. Faintly, one could still hear the sound of medicine being poured and the voices of customers. A woman in a qipao skillfully stepped over the threshold, took the packaged Chinese medicine from the outer wall, put it in a basket, and then turned and left.
0:3:29|0:3:46|Accompanied by the chirping of birds and the honking of trucks, at this moment, [Zhang Zhichen] has arrived at the path by the lake. The sunlight is shining on him, and he strides forward swiftly with a spirited demeanor. In the courtyard, [Lao Huang] has already found the young master, who turns out to be the crew-cut man who was just arranging the plaques.
0:3:46|0:3:53|Master Zhou Yuwen was only wearing a long robe, and Lao Huang quickened his pace, showing a slightly reproachful concern.
0:3:58|0:4:13|The master borrowed a scarf, tied it around his neck, and walked towards the seats in the pavilion, slowly sitting down in the shade of the long bench. He gazed at the flower trees in the courtyard, sighing softly to himself.
0:5:21|0:5:42|[Lao Huang] took the scarf handed to him by the young master and stood behind him, nodding in agreement. As they were talking, a woman in a cheongsam appeared at the end of the dim and narrow alley, pushing open the courtyard gate with her unbarred hand and walking quietly into the courtyard. The old wooden door creaked as she moved.
0:5:42|0:5:48|The woman entered the room, ignoring the young master and the old man in the pavilion, and walked straight ahead without looking sideways.
0:6:7|0:6:11|[Zhou Yuwen] heard his father was about to leave, and the young master quickly stopped him.
0:6:23|0:6:37|[Zhou Yuwen] listened and then walked to the young master's side, handing him the medicine packet at the top of the basket. The young master looked up, took the Chinese medicine packet wrapped in oil paper, and let out a sigh of disappointment.
0:6:49|0:7:8|[Zhou Yuwen] slung the basket back onto her arm, instructing that her younger sister should come back for lunch. After giving the instructions, she turned and left. The young master sighed after hearing this, threw the medicine packet on the ground, and then turned to look to the side. Seeing this, [Zhou Yuwen] had no choice but to return, pick up the medicine packet from the ground, and say to the young master.
0:7:18|0:7:35|Upon hearing Zhou Yuwen's words, Young Master paused for a moment, lowered his head without making eye contact with Yuwen, and turned away somewhat helplessly. After handing the medicine she had just picked up to Young Master, Zhou Yuwen turned around and left again. Young Master, after taking the medicine, childishly threw the medicine packet on the ground once more.
0:7:35|0:7:47|This time, Zhou Yuwen did not turn back to pick up the medicine bag, but left without looking back. The young master did not show any reluctance to see him leave, turned around and returned to the pavilion, sitting down and gazing straight ahead.
0:7:47|0:8:1|The man in a suit has arrived at a desolate village, which looks like it has just experienced a war. There is not a single intact wall to be seen, the whole village is empty and lifeless, with only a few bird chirps bringing some vitality to the village.
0:8:2|0:8:15|He stopped in front of a relatively intact courtyard, put down a suitcase, and skillfully walked to the front door. After peering inside through the crack in the door, he raised his hand and knocked heavily on the latch.
0:8:15|0:8:22|In the room, [Zhou Yuwen] had changed into a cheongsam. She was buttoning up the button loop while walking around the thin partition to the dressing table.
0:8:24|0:8:42|He didn't rush to sit down, but stood in front of the mirror carefully grooming himself for a while before slowly sitting down. Upon hearing a knock on the door, he didn't react hastily, but instead picked up a bottle of cologne from the dressing table, dabbed a little with his pinky finger, and lightly applied it in front of his nose.
0:8:42|0:8:52|Unfortunately, the cooling oil didn't work, and [Zhou Yuwen] still yawned. As the knocking on the door grew louder, he then shouted loudly to [Lao Huang] outside the door.
0:9:1|0:9:10|The man in a suit, finding no one to open the door, skillfully carried the box and walked into the alley, passing by [Lao Huang] who had just arrived to open the door.
0:9:10|0:9:20|[Lao Huang] pushed open the door, found no one around, and came out of the courtyard in confusion. After looking around the empty space in front of the courtyard gate for a while and making sure there was no one, he returned to the courtyard and closed the door again.
0:9:21|0:9:34|In the attic of the courtyard, [Zhou Yuwen] opens the bamboo curtain, sitting elegantly on the bench below the window, embroidering. Her movements are gentle and soothing, as if the fabric in her hands is not silk, but some Western treasure.
0:9:34|0:9:42|The fine embroidery needle shuttles on the silk cloth, accompanied by bird chirping, making her appear elegant and refined, a true lady of high society.
0:9:44|0:9:59|At the alley entrance, the man in a suit arrived at the back door where [Zhou Yuwen] had just passed by. After confirming at the door, he placed his luggage on the steps. After looking around the alley for a few moments, he knocked on the door latch. It was a long time before the young master's voice could be heard.
0:10:2|0:10:15|When he was at his wit's end, he found a hole in the wall and entered through it. In the courtyard, he encountered the young master who came to open the door. He quickly walked up behind the young master and said excitedly.
0:11:9|0:11:12|Zhou Yuwen did not respond, and Lao Huang raised his voice.
0:11:38|0:11:41|In the courtyard, [Dai Liyan] and [Zhang Zhichen] were still reminiscing.
0:13:7|0:13:11|[Zhang Zhichen] picks up the luggage in the corner, and [Lao Huang] quickly says.
0:13:41|0:13:50|[Lao Huang] said, "Let's go." He led [Zhang Zhichen] and [Dai Liyan] to sit in the pavilion, when suddenly [Zhang Zhichen] thought of something.
0:13:59|0:14:1|In the pavilion, Lao Huang found Yuwen.
0:14:26|0:14:32|After Lao Huang left, Zhou Yuwen returned to her room and carefully dressed up in front of a large dressing mirror.
0:14:50|0:15:7|[Zhou Yuwen] is wearing a dark floral cheongsam, with a high-quality jade bracelet on her wrist and a delicate jade pendant dangling from her earlobes. At this moment, she is carefully spraying perfume on the sides of her slender neck and slowly tying a scarf that matches her cheongsam by her side.
0:15:8|0:15:23|On the originally empty ring finger, he also put on a shiny diamond ring. After finishing his grooming, he swayed in front of the half-height mirror, made sure everything was in place, and then walked out of the door in a leisurely manner, with the sun shining just right at that moment.
0:15:23|0:15:35|[Zhou Yuwen] walked through the sunlit stone corridor and turned a corner to enter the courtyard. Dai [Zhang Zhichen] were still chatting, and [Zhou Yuwen] paused for a moment, deep in thought, before walking towards them.
0:15:36|0:15:52|At this moment, [Zhang Zhichen], who was leaning against the back of the chair in the pavilion, noticed [Zhou Yuwen] approaching. He quickly stood up to greet her, interrupting the conversation of Dai Liyan. Following his lead, Dai Liyan also saw [Zhou Yuwen]. He walked towards her with Zhang Zhichen and introduced her.
0:16:35|0:16:53|After Dai Liyan spoke, [Zhou Yuwen] had no choice but to return the suitcase to Zhang Zhichen. Seeing Zhichen taking the suitcase, Dai Liyan then walked along the corridor with his arm around Zhichen's shoulder, heading towards the inner room. [Zhou Yuwen] did not hurry to catch up with them, instead, it was Zhichen who, when turning the corner of the corridor, took a deep look at [Zhou Yuwen].
0:16:57|0:17:15|[Zhou Yuwen] immediately lowered her head and stopped looking at [Zhang Zhichen] the moment she saw his eyes. She followed the two of them slowly. [Lao Huang] pushed open the door and led [Dai Liyan] and Zhang into the house, then opened the windows one by one, letting the sunlight pour into the dim room.
0:17:54|0:18:13|Dai Liyan finished speaking with a bitter smile, walked into the room, and Zhang Zhichen quickly followed. The furnishings in the room were very simple, indicating that it had been uninhabited for a long time. Dai Liyan casually grabbed the cobweb hanging on the wooden cabinet and nostalgically said to Zhang Zhichen.
0:18:33|0:18:36|They were talking, but looking at Zhou Yuwen outside the window.
0:18:58|0:19:0|[Zhang Zhichen] hesitated for a few seconds before speaking.
0:19:25|0:19:37|Outside the room, [Zhou Yuwen] carefully brushed away the dust on the carved wooden door, the sunlight shining on her veiled face, so gentle and tranquil. In the backyard, a little girl ran into the courtyard.
0:19:55|0:20:3|Every time Lao Huang finishes speaking, the little girl rushes to the study. Zhou Yuwen sees the little girl running over in a hurry and greets her.
0:20:26|0:20:29|The little girl ran into [Dai Liyan] and bumped into [Zhang Zhichen].
0:20:33|0:20:42|The little girl who bumped into someone was a bit at a loss. She went to the outer room with [Zhang Zhichen] and lit a candle privately. [Zhang Zhichen] smiled gently and gave a hint.
0:21:52|0:22:9|[Zhang Zhichen] looked at the flowers without saying a word, then [Lao Huang] continued. [Zhang Zhichen] walked up to the orchids and carefully held them up, then turned his head when he heard the sound of water being poured into the basin by [Lao Huang].
0:22:33|0:22:45|In Dai Liyan's room, she was reading under a dim table lamp, with a candlestick standing by unlit. The occasional coughs constantly reminded Dai Liyan of her frail physical condition.
0:22:48|0:23:8|[Zhou Yuwen] walked past the room where [Dai Liyan] was acting as a salt agent. He heard voices, stopped by the window for a moment, but did not enter the room to check. He continued walking down the corridor towards elsewhere. He was still wearing the qipao with a dark floral pattern from the daytime, with moonlight shining on his back, making the pattern on the qipao faintly visible, giving him a graceful and elegant appearance.
0:23:10|0:23:25|In the study, [Zhang Zhichen] felt like he had lost his soul since [Lao Huang] left. He closed the door, sat down by the orchid shelf, and lowered his head in contemplation. After a while, a gentle knock on the door was heard from outside. He shook himself out of his thoughts and walked to the door in three quick steps.
0:23:30|0:23:37|[Zhou Yuwen] walked slowly into the room and placed the hot water kettle on the table. Zhang Zhichen noticed the kettle in his hand.
0:23:38|0:23:40|[Zhou Yuwen] glanced at Zhang Zhichen.
0:23:45|0:23:47|[Zhou Yuwen] pushed the water bottle on the table.
0:23:53|0:23:58|[Zhou Yuwen] ignored these words and instead turned around, casting a glance at the dim room.
0:24:5|0:24:18|Zhang Zhichen slowly walked up behind [Zhou Yuwen], who had her back to him. Neither of them spoke a word. After maintaining this posture for a long time, Zhang Zhichen finally spoke slowly.
0:24:30|0:24:44|[Zhou Yuwen] put down the candle, walked from the other side of the table to the shelf with orchids, and opened the distance with [Zhang Zhichen]. Half-turning her body, she looked at Zhang Zhichen who was standing with his arm around her waist.
0:24:45|0:24:48|Zhang Zhichen immediately caught up with [Zhou Yuwen].
0:24:55|0:24:59|Zhang Zhichen awkwardly tried to stop Zhou Yuwen.
0:25:4|0:25:8|Yuwen Zhou smiled lightly. Speaking, Yuwen walked out of the room.
0:25:12|0:25:18|Zhang Zhichen watched Zhou Yuwen leave, standing by the window and gazing at her until her figure disappeared into the moonlight.
0:25:21|0:25:37|After a while, Yuwen appeared in the corridor wearing a small coat. He held a heavy blanket on one side, and as he passed by Dai Liyan's room, he heard his urgent coughing from inside. Zhou Yuwen stopped at the door, sighed, then quietly left with the blanket.
0:25:40|0:26:1|In the study, Zhang Zhichen saw Zhou Yuwen bringing a blanket from outside and quickly went up to open the door for him. After Zhou Yuwen entered, he did not pay attention to Zhang Zhichen, but walked towards the bed and carefully spread out the blanket. Zhang Zhichen did not speak either, just silently stood behind Zhou Yuwen, quietly waiting for Zhou Yuwen to speak.
0:26:1|0:26:5|[Zhou Yuwen] asked only after making the bed.
0:26:10|0:26:37|Zhang Zhichen nervously twirled the needle. Zhang Zhichen confidently looked at [Zhou Yuwen]. [Zhou Yuwen] did not show any signs of happiness. Even after they finished speaking, [Zhou Yuwen] did not turn around, but looked directly at Zhang Zhichen. It was Zhang Zhichen who kept staring at [Zhou Yuwen], as if trying to see through him.
0:26:39|0:27:0|Zhang Zhichen and Dai Liyan maintained this posture, remaining silent. Finally, seeing no response from Dai Liyan, Zhang Zhichen turned to look out the window. Lao Huang had already finished patrolling the courtyard at this time. He carried an oil lamp, swiftly extinguished the outdoor lights, and with a thud, closed the old wooden gate from the inside.
0:27:0|0:27:7|His body is getting weaker and his temper is getting worse.
0:27:17|0:27:27|Yuwen released their hands held together. Zhichen noticed Zhou Yuwen's movement and silently took a step back.
0:27:56|0:28:19|[Zhou Yuwen] said, turned around and quickly pulled the overhead lamp. [Zhou Yuwen] picked up the bamboo stand on the small table, walked towards the desk with candles, skillfully assembled the bamboo stand and candle, took the match from Zhang Zhichen's hand, and with a hiss, lit the candle.
0:28:22|0:28:40|In a light moment, the candlelight and the lamp illuminated them. Zhang Zhichen looked at [Zhou Yuwen]. [Zhou Yuwen] blew out the match in his hand. Zhang Zhichen picked up a stool to hand to [Zhou Yuwen], only to see that [Zhou Yuwen] had already sat down at the foot of the bed.
0:28:40|0:28:46|He came to the bedside, wanting to sit next to [Zhou Yuwen], but [Zhou Yuwen] resisted slightly and shrank back.
0:28:47|0:29:0|Zhang Zhichen awkwardly straightened the bedding, then turned to the other side of the bed. Sitting down, Zhang Zhichen rubbed his hands nervously.
0:29:3|0:29:12|He was speaking when the overhead light suddenly flickered and went out. The room instantly darkened, with only a candle remaining as the sole source of light.
0:29:14|0:29:35|[Zhou Yuwen] saw the room darken and, letting down his guard, quietly sobbed. He covered his face with one hand, preventing the tears from falling. Zhang Zhichen, upon seeing this, immediately stood up to comfort him. Just as he placed his left hand on [Zhou Yuwen]'s shoulder, [Zhou Yuwen] suddenly wanted to leave. Zhang Zhichen followed him in a daze, saying nothing.
0:29:35|0:29:53|[Zhou Yuwen] raised her hand to stop Zhang Zhichen and said, "Zhou Yuwen, open the door." Without looking back, Zhou Yuwen walked out of the study. Zhang Zhichen finally came to his senses and quickly caught up with Zhou Yuwen, standing outside the door, staring blankly at her disappearing figure.
0:29:56|0:30:15|Early the next morning, [Zhou Yuwen] changed into a simple cheongsam, with her hair tied up and fluttering in the wind. At this moment, she was standing by the city wall, gazing into the distance. The town was shrouded in morning mist, and the distant scenery was not very clear. However, she kept looking up from time to time, leaving people unsure of what was on her mind at that moment.
0:30:15|0:30:28|Outside the designated driver's yard, [Lao Huang] is emptying out last night's medicine residue. Inside the yard, Zhang Zhichen is wearing a new suit. As soon as he opens the door, he runs into [Dai Xiu] who has come to find him.
0:32:21|0:32:30|Don't rush to hand the hand warmer to Agent Dai.
0:33:42|0:33:46|[Dai Xiu] accidentally said the wrong thing and quickly corrected herself.
0:34:42|0:34:46|On the small road leading to Xuzhuang, [Dai Liyan] and [Zhang Zhichen] were panting as they ran from behind.
0:34:58|0:35:12|Dai Liyan stumbled while going downhill, Zhang Zhichen quickly reached out to help, but accidentally ended up catching Dai Xiu and Zhou Yuwen who were walking behind. As they went downhill, Zhou Yuwen let go of Zhang Zhichen's hand as if being shocked by electricity.
0:35:22|0:35:41|With Little Sister urging them on, Zhou Yuwen found the uphill climb a bit difficult. Zhang Zhichen glanced back at the lagging Zhou Yuwen, but didn't offer help. Instead, Little Sister reached out a hand to assist Zhou Yuwen. On the vast lake, they boarded a boat, and the sound of Little Sister's singing drifted over like a flute.
0:37:1|0:37:12|The group had a great time playing, singing with the younger sister, [Zhang Zhichen] rowed the boat reluctantly. In the quiet of the night, [Dai Liyan], who had just finished washing up, walked up to the mirror in pajamas and said to himself in front of the mirror.
0:37:47|0:37:56|[Dai Xiu] took the medicine from [Zhou Yuwen]'s hand, but immediately spat it out. [Zhou Yuwen] quickly handed him a prepared handkerchief, [Dai Xiu] wiped his mouth and threw the handkerchief on the table.
0:37:58|0:38:10|[Zhou Yuwen] heard this and remained silent, tidying up the table that was messed up by taking medicine, picking up the tray and turning to leave. [Dai Xiu] saw him leaving without stopping him, pulled up the blanket and leaned against the head of the bed, pondering about something.
0:38:12|0:38:30|The entire Dai family courtyard was getting ready to sleep, with the yard quiet and still. In the study, [Zhang Zhichen] was washing and wiping himself. [Zhou Yuwen] had returned to her room and finished washing up early. At this moment, she was sitting in front of a half-height dressing mirror, carefully tidying up before the power went out.
0:38:30|0:38:36|As he was about to wipe his face, [Dai Xiu], who had just finished showering, walked in while drying his hair.
0:38:40|0:38:46|After closing the door, Da Xiaomei bounced over to stand behind [Zhou Yuwen], placing her hand on Zhou Yuwen's shoulder.
0:38:48|0:38:59|[Zhou Yuwen] smiled slightly after hearing it, stood up and gave up the stool. Daxiaomei sat down in front of the dressing table, and [Zhou Yuwen] took the towel from her hand and gently dried her wet hair.
0:39:2|0:39:5|Zhou Yuwen glanced at the large mirror in front of her and continued speaking.
0:39:32|0:39:34|Dai Xiaomei shyly turned her head to look at [Zhou Yuwen].
0:39:40|0:39:49|[Zhou Yuwen] unscrewed the bottle of hair oil in her hand. [Zhang Zhichen], who lived in a big city, had seen the world.
0:40:4|0:40:6|[Zhou Yuwen] leaned against the desk and joked around.
0:40:10|0:40:29|Dai Xiaomei's words made her a little shy. After Dai Xiaomei finished speaking, [Zhou Yuwen] stared at the mirror in silence. Dai Xiaomei looked at [Zhou Yuwen], then at herself in the mirror, and smiled somewhat embarrassedly. The two sisters whispered to each other, while [Zhang Zhichen] in the study was alone organizing luggage.
0:40:29|0:40:50|The alarm sounded in the distance, reminding everyone of the impending power outage. As soon as it struck 12 o'clock, the lights in the room flickered a few times before dimming. Zhang Zhichen was not in a hurry. He first tidied up the clothes in his hands before walking to the table to light a candle with a match. Then he sat at the corner of the bed, staring blankly.
0:40:50|0:41:1|The alarm was still ringing, echoing in the silent room, making it a bit eerie. It was already late at night, and [Zhang Zhichen] was not in a hurry to sleep, not knowing how long he would maintain this dazed posture.
0:41:3|0:41:14|A new day dawns, [Zhou Yuwen] picks up the basket hanging on the cabinet, ready to buy groceries. Coincidentally, he meets [Zhang Zhichen] passing by. [Zhang Zhichen] smiles and says to him.
0:41:37|0:41:50|[Zhou Yuwen] smiled slightly in agreement, then disappeared at the end of the corridor with a basket of vegetables. [Zhang Zhichen] looked at his gradually disappearing figure with some joy until he completely disappeared from sight.
0:41:50|0:42:12|After breakfast, [Zhou Yuwen] and [Zhang Zhichen] arrived as scheduled. [Zhou Yuwen] had already stood up, but neither of them let go of the hands they had held onto just now when he helped her up.
0:42:23|0:42:29|[Zhou Yuwen] responded with a smile, [Zhang Zhichen] walked up to him and stared at him.
0:42:41|0:42:59|[Zhou Yuwen] raised her head to look elsewhere, and smiled lightly at [Zhang Zhichen]'s face. As he finished speaking, neither of them spoke again. Suddenly, [Zhang Zhichen] turned around and walked along the city wall. [Zhou Yuwen] followed him silently, the birds chirping around taking advantage of the quiet atmosphere between the two.
0:43:1|0:43:16|On the roadside, a scarf is hanging on a tree, swaying lonely in the wind. [Zhang Zhichen] stopped at the highest point of the city wall, [Zhou Yuwen] stopped a few steps behind him, then turned around and stopped looking at him.
0:43:18|0:43:26|[Zhang Zhichen] heard this and immediately turned around to embrace [Zhou Yuwen]. [Zhou Yuwen] hesitated for a moment, then leaned against [Zhang Zhichen]'s chest.
0:43:33|0:43:38|[Zhou Yuwen] gently opened [Zhang Zhichen]'s arms and walked towards [Lao Huang] who was holding a handkerchief.
0:43:41|0:43:45|She looked at [Zhang Zhichen] somewhat shyly and smiled.
0:43:52|0:43:58|[Zhang Zhichen] listened to her finish, then like a gust of wind, floated down the city wall and ran down the pebble path with big strides.
0:44:0|0:44:14|Ignoring the exquisite suit on his body, like a monkey, he quickly climbed up to [Lao Huang]. His tree-climbing posture was very skilled, and in no time he reached the handkerchief hanging on the branch, hurriedly rushing down the slope towards [Zhou Yuwen] to show off the loot.
0:44:16|0:44:31|[Zhou Yuwen] saw the situation and covered her mouth, then hurriedly ran away. [Zhang Zhichen] decisively put down the waving handkerchief. The date ended abruptly, as if nothing had ever happened. On the attic rooftop, [Zhang Zhichen] pondered while playing with the oranges in his hand.
0:44:31|0:44:43|The sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl's mind is quite complicated and hard to figure out. In [Dr. Dai]'s room, Zhang Zhichen is using a stethoscope to give her a follow-up check-up. After the treatment, [Dr. Dai]'s health has improved a lot.
0:46:8|0:46:15|She, alone in the room, was in tears, without a hint of a smile in front of others.
0:46:30|0:46:39|At this point, [Dai Liyan] sighed. [Dai Liyan] lowered his head in silence, as if he had remembered something and anxiously spoke up.
0:47:29|0:47:38|[Zhou Yuwen] sat on the chair, speaking slowly. At this point, she turned away with a hint of sadness, let out a sigh, and a few teardrops could be seen in her eyes. [Zhou Yuwen] spoke in a calm tone, as if everything had nothing to do with her.
0:48:3|0:48:23|The heavy words were hitting [Zhang Zhichen] one by one, as he walked silently towards the shelf, continuing to listen. [Zhou Yuwen] paid no attention to [Zhang Zhichen] and kept talking to herself. When [Zhou Yuwen] reached this point, the calm facade finally cracked a bit, he sighed, lowered his head in dismay, and then continued speaking.
0:48:39|0:48:49|Sunlight fell on Zhou Yuwen's face, her delicate features filled with sadness. Zhang Zhichen approached after the rain, hesitated for a long time before finally not getting close to Zhou Yuwen.
0:49:2|0:49:13|[Zhou Yuwen] struggled to maintain her composure, sobbing as she continued speaking. [Zhang Zhichen] slowly placed his hand on [Zhou Yuwen]'s hand.
0:49:17|0:49:21|[Zhou Yuwen] shed no tears, allowing only the tears to flow down.
0:50:1|0:50:15|He was speaking when [Zhang Zhichen] gently held him in his arms. But as he finished speaking, he quickly realized that the current action with [Zhang Zhichen] was a bit crossing the line. He promptly pushed [Zhang Zhichen] away, turned to the side, and no longer looked at him.
0:50:15|0:50:24|Early the next morning, [Zhou Yuwen] dressed in a simple cheongsam as usual, tied up her hair with a handkerchief, and walked down the street with a basket.
0:50:26|0:50:46|She left very early, the streets were empty with not a soul in sight, only the distant sound of birds and the clacking of shoes on the stone pavement could be heard. The once tall walls on both sides of the alley were no longer there, now only broken remnants remained. In the midst of solitude, [Zhou Yuwen] quietly disappeared at the end of the alley.
0:50:46|0:50:54|Unlike the loneliness on the street, the atmosphere in the courtyard of Dai Liyan's family is lively. Early in the morning, Dai Xiu dashed into the corridor and ran towards Zhang Zhichen's room.
0:50:59|0:51:17|[Zhang Zhichen] heard [Dai Xiu]'s call but did not respond, instead he went to the utility room to seek peace and quiet. Listening to the footsteps outside the door, [Dai Xiu] searched for his voice, pacing back and forth in the utility room, the anxious footsteps echoing on the floor, announcing the heaviness and boredom of the owner's mind.
0:51:17|0:51:22|He sat weakly on a low stool on the side, his tall figure showing helplessness.
0:51:26|0:51:43|[Dai Xiu] couldn't find her no matter how hard she tried, and rushed out the door. In the Dai family garden, [Dai Liyan] was sitting in the sun, carefully reading a book. Her spirits seemed much better than before. [Zhang Zhichen] walked over from the front yard and greeted her.
0:52:21|0:52:27|[Dai Liyan] smiled and put his hands behind his back, then walked along the path. [Zhang Zhichen] quickly followed behind him.
0:52:37|0:52:41|[Zhang Zhichen] lowered his head in shame after hearing about the losses.
0:53:38|0:53:41|In school, [Zhang Zhichen] greets the classmates nearby.
0:54:46|0:54:53|Accompanied by the music, the once shy students no longer held back, inviting their desired dance partners to glide into the dance floor together.
0:55:19|0:55:38|Night was falling, [Zhou Yuwen] walked alone on the city wall with a basket in hand, silently wandering. The ancient collapsed city wall looked even more dilapidated at this moment. He stood quietly in his cheongsam, the hem swaying in the evening breeze, but he paid no attention. He walked aimlessly on the overgrown path, with no specific destination in mind, just strolling and observing.
0:55:38|0:55:58|In the end, he stood by the lake looking into the distance. In the dim night, in the study room, [Zhang Zhichen] lay on the bed, idly playing with miscellaneous items. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door outside, but he paid no attention to the visitor and continued to fiddle with the small trinket in his hand.
0:55:58|0:56:7|The unexpected guest who was ignored and pushed open the door was [Zhou Yuwen]. He stepped into the study and remained silent after entering.
0:56:43|0:56:57|[Zhou Yuwen] is untying [Zhang Zhichen]'s restraints and walks to the small table in the other corner of the room. [Zhang Zhichen] doesn't hurry to follow, he takes a step forward to pull the light cord before walking behind [Zhou Yuwen].
0:57:3|0:57:11|[Zhou Yuwen] shifted her body away, avoiding any contact with [Zhang Zhichen], and walked slowly alone in the small room. She shook her head.
0:57:39|0:57:41|The expression on the face in the dark cannot be clearly seen from the side.
0:57:48|0:57:52|[Zhang Zhichen] grabbed [Zhou Yuwen]'s arm and pulled it forcefully.
0:57:59|0:58:8|[Zhou Yuwen] finished speaking and looked meaningfully at [Zhang Zhichen]. [Zhang Zhichen], feeling uncomfortable under his gaze, turned his head away and stopped looking at him.
0:58:11|0:58:18|[Zhou Yuwen], with a victorious smile on her face, walked up to [Zhang Zhichen] and stood in front of him, raising her head and speaking.
0:58:25|0:58:39|[Zhang Zhichen] was a bit nervous, reaching out to stop [Zhou Yuwen] from leaving, but [Zhou Yuwen] ignored his actions. [Zhou Yuwen] opened the door to leave, but then leaned against half of the door frame and leaned into the room.
0:58:45|0:58:57|[Zhou Yuwen] jokingly left these words before leaving. After he left, [Zhang Zhichen] weakly leaned against the table, lost in thought for a long time. In the room, he lay on the couch, waiting for [Zhou Yuwen] to bring the medicine.
0:59:3|0:59:9|[Zhou Yuwen] walked into the room carrying a tray of medicine. [Dai Liyan] heard him refuse and seemed a little distracted.
0:59:15|0:59:18|[Zhou Yuwen] sat down slowly next to the agent.
0:59:28|0:59:36|Zhou Yuwen did not answer any of the questions that were not asked. He placed the cup in his hand on the small table.
0:59:39|0:59:43|[Zhou Yuwen] looked at Dai Liyan in confusion.
0:59:47|0:59:58|Dai Liyan changed his posture and moved closer to Zhou Yuwen. Zhou Yuwen looked at Dai Liyan beside him.
1:0:48|1:0:59|After Dai Liyan finished speaking, he looked at [Zhou Yuwen]. [Zhou Yuwen] nervously clasped her hands together. Dai Liyan looked at [Zhou Yuwen] with some confusion.
1:1:7|1:1:24|[Zhou Yuwen] placed her hand on Dai Liyan's hand. Dai Liyan, seeing her persistence, nodded in agreement. When Zhou Yuwen saw him relax his grip, she then withdrew her hand. With the response she needed, Zhou Yuwen prepared to leave.
1:1:31|1:1:38|Please, [Dai Liyan] grabbed Zhou Yuwen's arm, but Zhou Yuwen ignored her and removed her arm, standing up.
1:1:39|1:1:53|[Zhou Yuwen] didn't linger much and left on her own. [Dai Liyan]'s gaze followed [Zhou Yuwen]'s figure until she walked out of the door and disappeared into the night. [Dai Liyan] let out a heavy sigh and bowed his head in silent contemplation.
1:1:55|1:2:14|At the break of dawn, [Zhou Yuwen] arrived at the city wall early. He was still wearing that simple cheongsam, carrying a basket of vegetables. When [Zhang Zhichen], who had been waiting for a long time, saw him, he hurried to greet him. [Zhou Yuwen] had already anticipated this, ignoring him and walking past as if no one else was there.
1:2:14|1:2:17|He placed the basket on the stone bricks and glanced at [Zhang Zhichen] behind him.
1:2:30|1:2:41|The spring breeze tousled Zhou Yuwen's hair, a smile on his face as he slowly walked towards the ancient tree by the road. After stopping, he turned his head to glance at the profound Zhang Zhichen.
1:3:33|1:3:45|Li Yan didn't even think about how young her sister is. Hearing this, [Zhang Zhichen] looked a bit bewildered. After a while, he finally chuckled and spoke.
1:3:48|1:3:51|[Zhou Yuwen] looked at [Zhang Zhichen] with a touch of sadness.
1:3:53|1:4:0|[Zhang Zhichen] finished his recollection, and [Zhou Yuwen] could no longer maintain the calm makeup on her face, looking around with a hint of loneliness.
1:4:6|1:4:9|[Zhou Yuwen] slowly approached [Zhang Zhichen].
1:4:18|1:4:26|Zhang Zhichen sighed and walked weakly to the edge of the wall, leaning somewhat helplessly against the stone wall.
1:4:50|1:5:3|Zhang Zhichen's words made the atmosphere somewhat heavy, and for a while no one spoke again. It was not until Zhou Yuwen spoke.
1:5:3|1:5:24|Zhang Zhichen turned around in frustration, sighed heavily, and Zhou Yuwen glanced at him. Seeing that Zhang Zhichen was ignoring her, she silently walked over to his side. Zhang Zhichen noticed her approaching, moved aside without looking at Zhou Yuwen. Zhou Yuwen didn't mind Zhang Zhichen's actions and just silently lingered on the path.
1:5:38|1:5:41|At night, everyone is celebrating Little Sister's birthday.
1:8:40|1:8:42|[Zhou Yuwen] finished the drink in one gulp.
1:9:29|1:9:42|Xiao Mei took the wine glass, took a sip, looked at his wife on behalf of [Dai Liyan], and said, the two of them picked up the wine glasses and drank them all.
1:9:47|1:10:3|[Zhou Yuwen] quickly helped [Dai Liyan] calm down, then picked up the wine glass and refilled it. [Zhou Yuwen] raised the wine glass and walked towards Zhang Zhichen.
1:10:32|1:10:36|When Zhang Zhichen was drinking, Dai Liyan's expression seemed somewhat displeased.
1:10:50|1:10:56|[Zhou Yuwen] took the wine jug and poured wine for Zhang Zhichen himself. But [Dai Liyan] stood up and left the table.
1:11:25|1:11:30|In the candlelight, [Zhou Yuwen] and [Zhang Zhichen] drank cup after cup, with [Zhang Zhichen] boldly finishing his drink in one go.
1:11:37|1:11:50|The two of them raised their glasses joyfully. While everyone was playing drinking games with Zhang Zhichen in the room, Dai Xiu quietly walked alone to the garden in the backyard.
1:11:52|1:12:7|The night was dark and heavy, like thick ink hanging in the sky, seemingly echoing the loneliness of [Dai Liyan], with only a few stars scattered. In the moonlight, he slowly wandered on the path, his steps extremely slow, leisurely meandering in the night.
1:12:7|1:12:16|At this point, it had been night for a long time. Relying solely on the moonlight, they couldn't see the road clearly. However, Dai Liyan did not bring a lantern, and instead groped his way forward slowly.
1:12:18|1:12:28|The garden was not large. [Dai Xiu] walked along the corridor to the side of the rockery, leaning weakly against it. In the moonlight, her figure looked so lonely.
1:12:31|1:12:45|After a while, she turned slowly, pacing back silently along the path she had just taken. However, Li Yan seemed a bit absent-minded. Despite showing signs of improvement under the care of [Zhang Zhichen], it now appeared that her condition had worsened.
1:12:45|1:12:50|The hunched body and slow pace of Zhou Yuwen made her look like a dying old person.
1:12:52|1:13:12|He quietly walked along the small path to the corner of the garden where the old tree stood, running his fingers along the patterns on the trunk. With a somewhat melancholic look, he gazed at the front yard, his eyes filled with sorrow and pain. He reached out and embraced the tree branches, holding them tightly as if seeking warmth from the branches in his arms.
1:13:12|1:13:16|He tightly embraced the old tree and finally couldn't help but sob helplessly.
1:14:5|1:14:18|[Dai Liyan] was like a child, venting his helplessness and suffering alone. He sobbed softly, shedding the calm facade he usually wore, finally letting out his emotions. In a secluded corner with no one around, he quietly expressed his pain.
1:14:20|1:14:25|In the front yard, the drunken [Zhang Zhichen] started singing a lovely song, "A Rose".
1:15:34|1:15:46|[Zhang Zhichen] sang until he was a little tired, leaning against the wooden door pretending to sleep. [Zhou Yuwen] and [Dai Xiu] were preparing to leave with a lantern.
1:16:34|1:16:36|But [Dai Xiu] looked at [Zhou Yuwen], and then glanced at [Zhang Zhichen].
1:17:17|1:17:35|[Dai Xiu] pulled [Zhou Yuwen] out of the alley, leaving only [Zhang Zhichen] to sing a song. He leaned against the door panel, singing with tears in his eyes. Finally, [Zhang Zhichen] couldn't hold on any longer, and his body slowly slid down the door panel.
1:17:58|1:18:17|[Zhou Yuwen] is lying on the bed in the room, poking the air softly. He turns over, lying on his back on the bed, unable to stop sobbing. Tears fall silently, his arms hanging weakly by his side, looking like a butterfly with broken wings, as if the person who was about to drink and gamble with [Zhang Zhichen] just now was not him.
1:18:19|1:18:38|Suddenly, as if he had remembered something, he struggled to prop himself up with his arms and weakly walked towards the dressing table not far away. Taking small, hesitant steps, he approached the half-height mirror and looked at his reflection. [Zhou Yuwen] kept touching his own face, wiping away the tears on his face with a sense of determination.
1:18:40|1:18:53|[Zhou Yuwen] looked around at the surroundings, picked up the bronze hand mirror beside him, and carefully polished his face inch by inch. Holding a smile on his face, he chuckled softly, then suddenly put down the mirror and walked away.
1:18:53|1:19:0|He suddenly opened the wardrobe, as if making a firm decision, like a king, surveying the belongings in his wardrobe.
1:19:1|1:19:16|Returning from the backyard, [Dai Liyan] just stepped onto the carved corridor and coincidentally met [Zhou Yuwen] who had changed into a new outfit. Traces of tears could be faintly seen on [Zhou Yuwen]'s face. Upon seeing [Dai Liyan] approaching, she didn't speak or look at him, but stared blankly ahead.
1:19:16|1:19:33|[Dai Liyan] broke the somewhat awkward atmosphere. [Zhou Yuwen] did not respond. He took a deep breath and slowly released the handkerchief he was clutching. The moonlight shone on him, making him look like a lifeless jade beauty, cold and inscrutable.
1:19:33|1:19:44|[Dai Liyan] saw his reaction and, somewhat helplessly, walked away with his hands behind his back, hunching his body. Seeing his figure disappear at the end of the corridor, [Zhou Yuwen] also immediately headed towards the direction of the study.
1:19:51|1:20:9|Under the cover of night, the entire courtyard was quiet, only the sound of Zhou Yuwen's heels hitting the stone bricks could be heard, slowly fading away into the peaceful night. In Zhang Zhichen's room, he was wiping his face with water, now fully awake, as if the person who just sang love songs to Zhou Yuwen was not him.
1:20:46|1:21:1|[Zhou Yuwen] finished speaking, pushed [Zhang Zhichen] who was blocking the door, stubbornly entered his room, and stood in front of the desk inside the room. Seeing his stubbornness, [Zhang Zhichen] sat on the bed helplessly, anxiously rubbing his hair back and forth.
1:21:4|1:21:16|[Zhou Yuwen] suddenly had a hint of a smile on his face, but the smile was icy and did not reach his eyes. He turned his head to look at [Zhang Zhichen] sitting by the bed, then suddenly swayed his slender waist towards him.
1:21:16|1:21:22|[Zhou Yuwen] slowly approached [Zhang Zhichen], sat down beside him, and buried her face slowly into [Zhang Zhichen]'s shoulder.
1:21:23|1:21:40|[Zhang Zhichen] did not refuse at first, but a few seconds later, he couldn't bear the condemnation of his conscience and pushed [Zhou Yuwen] away, rushing to the desk as if fleeing in panic. [Zhou Yuwen] was not angry after being pushed away. He walked slowly towards [Zhang Zhichen] and stood silently by his side.
1:21:44|1:21:57|[Zhou Yuwen] suddenly grabbed [Zhang Zhichen]'s collar, staring at him fiercely. Zhang Zhichen was taken aback by his sudden move, but quickly reacted. Zhang Zhichen suddenly picked up [Zhou Yuwen] around the waist and walked towards the bed.
1:21:58|1:22:12|The candlelight in the room grew brighter and brighter. In the flickering light, the two of them appeared clumsy in their hurried movements. Suddenly, Zhang Zhichen paused and looked at Zhou Yuwen's face. Dai Liyan snapped out of it and slowly set the person in his arms down.
1:22:12|1:22:24|He ran out suddenly, locking the door with a bolt to isolate [Zhou Yuwen] from himself. Trapped inside the house, [Zhou Yuwen] felt a bit at a loss. He wanted to get closer to Zhang Zhichen, but Zhang Zhichen dared not indulge him.
1:22:25|1:22:44|[Zhou Yuwen] helplessly knocked on the glass of the carved door. Zhang Zhichen ignored her and silently walked to the other side, burying his head weakly in the corner. [Zhou Yuwen] increased the intensity of knocking on the glass, seeing Zhang Zhichen still ignoring her, she suddenly raised her hand, smashed the glass, really took the lock off the door, and then entered the house.
1:22:44|1:22:55|The sound of glass shattering seemed louder in the silent night. Dai Liyan was ready to go to sleep, but he heard the sound near his bed and remained silent for a long time before slowly blowing out the candle next to the bed.
1:22:56|1:23:9|Dai Liyan couldn't sleep soundly, constantly adjusting her sleeping position, looking restless and burdened. In the study, Zhang Zhichen saw Zhou Yuwen breaking the lock on the glass door, hurriedly entered, and checked her injuries.
1:23:9|1:23:24|[Zhang Zhichen] half knelt beside her, gently picked up [Zhou Yuwen]'s soft hoof, buried his face in her hand back, they were as quiet as the night at this moment, no one wanted to break the peace of this moment. [Zhou Yuwen] ignored him, took her hand inch by inch, turned and walked out of the study.
1:23:25|1:23:40|After Zhou Yuwen left, Zhang Zhichen sat dejectedly on the floor, with an infinite sense of regret apparent on his face, illuminated by the candlelight. His usually well-pressed suit was now wrinkled and he paid no attention to it.
1:23:40|1:23:47|[Zhou Yuwen] has returned to the room. Sitting alone in front of the dressing table, he lights a candle. After bandaging his wounds, [Zhou Yuwen] spends a long time in front of the vanity.
1:24:10|1:24:26|He slowly got up, walked around the shelf with a vase, and reached out to turn off the lights in the room. The room was immediately shrouded in darkness, and Zhou Yuwen did not immediately push the door open. He quietly leaned against the door frame, his body rising and falling with his rapid breaths.
1:24:27|1:24:48|He carefully examined the furnishings in the room, unwilling to miss a single detail. [Zhang Zhichen] sat on the floor in the study, deep in thought. At this moment, he no longer appeared as confident as before. His expression was blank, his face filled with sorrow and despair, looking completely different from his previous confident self.
1:24:48|1:24:52|His hands lay weakly between his spread legs, looking extremely decadent.
1:24:53|1:25:14|The room fell silent again, [Zhou Yuwen] walked to the door, but then hesitated and stopped in his tracks. Leaning against the door, he pondered whether to go out. After taking a deep breath, he remained standing in front of the door in silence. In [Dai Liyan]'s room, he had already laid down and the quiet room was suddenly interrupted by a series of urgent knocks on the door.
1:25:14|1:25:18|[Dai Liyan] did not get up, but looked up with a puzzled expression and asked towards the door.
1:25:26|1:25:32|Zhang Zhichen gently pushed the door open and entered the room.
1:25:41|1:25:53|In the dimly lit room, Zhang Zhichen, guided by the moonlight filtering in, felt his way to the table and bent down to search for medicine in the drawer. Fortunately, he found it easily and soon picked up a medicine bottle, pouring out a few pills into his hand.
1:26:5|1:26:12|When Zhang Zhichen hurried to the door, he looked back at Dai Liyan with some concern, opened his mouth as if to say something, but in the end, he left without a word.
1:26:29|1:26:37|Dai Liyan saw him leave, was about to go to sleep, when footsteps were heard outside the door. The person did not knock, but pushed the door open with a bamboo chain. Hearing the voice of [Zhou Yuwen], Dai Liyan suddenly sat up and turned on the table lamp, looking at her with some confusion.
1:27:21|1:27:34|[Zhou Yuwen] sat slowly on the edge of the bed, but her gaze never met Dai Liyan's. Dai Liyan seemed to ignore her avoidance, resting her arms on the small table at the head of the bed, and slowly spoke to [Zhou Yuwen].
1:28:22|1:28:33|[Zhou Yuwen] lowered her head silently upon hearing these words. [Dai Liyan] continued speaking. At this point, [Dai Liyan] seemed a bit lost in thought.
1:28:38|1:28:42|[Zhou Yuwen] looked up in surprise, but still did not meet [Dai Liyan]'s gaze.
1:28:46|1:28:54|[Zhou Yuwen] was a bit absent-minded, shaking his head gently in denial. Seeing his reaction, [Dai Liyan] softly took his hand.
1:28:55|1:29:3|[Zhou Yuwen] said nothing, but used his hand to pull [Dai Liyan]'s hand away. Now, [Dai Liyan] could see the wound on his hand clearly.
1:29:13|1:29:25|[Zhou Yuwen] wanted to speak up to refuse, but before he could say a word, [Dai Liyan] had already hurriedly gotten up. Seeing his reaction, [Zhou Yuwen] turned away, ignoring his anxious figure searching for medicine.
1:29:25|1:29:36|[Dai Liyan] skillfully came to the cabinet, opened the drawer, found the white medicine, took it and quickly came to the bedside, pulled [Zhou Yuwen]'s hand, carefully removed the previously improperly wrapped bandage.
1:29:42|1:29:48|[Dai Liyan] carefully unwrapped the bandages as if holding a precious treasure, afraid that [Zhou Yuwen] would suffer any more injuries.
1:29:54|1:30:8|Dai Liyan furrowed his brows and tenderly helped [Zhou Yuwen] apply medicine. [Zhou Yuwen] couldn't stop choking because of his actions, and his eyes gradually became moist. Seeing him cry, Dai Liyan gently blew on his wound and his hand holding the cotton swab was about to be gentle.
1:30:8|1:30:13|[Zhou Yuwen] sat down slowly beside him, tears streaming down her face as she watched Dai Liyan's gentle movements.
1:30:14|1:30:33|At this moment, the two of them forgot everything that had happened before, just like an ordinary couple. Dai Liyan carefully applied ointment to [Zhou Yuwen], and [Zhou Yuwen] gradually calmed down because of his gentle actions. The early morning light illuminated the Dai family's courtyard. Dai Liyan held a book, accompanied by the chirping of birds, sitting in a daze in the pavilion in the garden.
1:30:33|1:30:41|Zhang Zhichen walked along the corridor and saw Dai Liyan. He didn't speak, but leaned against the railing and stared blankly at the ground.
1:31:22|1:31:28|Zhang Zhichen turned his head with a guilty look, his gaze somewhat uneasy, no longer meeting the eyes of the agent.
1:31:36|1:31:43|Dai Liyan's expression was somewhat strange. He avoided Zhang Zhichen's charming gaze and awkwardly changed the subject.
1:31:55|1:32:10|Zhang Zhichen, lost in his daydream, did not speak for a long time. By the city wall, Zhou Yuwen walked silently along the desolate path outside the river in early spring, carrying a basket. In the distance, the faintly visible rice fields still showed some signs of life.
1:32:10|1:32:16|[Zhou Yuwen] stood by the river, gazing into the distance. The cold morning wind wrapped around his slender body, making him appear so cold.
1:32:17|1:32:32|He stood silently, no one knew what he was looking at, what he was thinking. The breeze ruffled his skirt, but he didn't care. Rather than walking, he seemed more like wandering, like a helpless duckweed, quietly drifting above the small town.
1:32:44|1:32:56|In the courtyard, [Dai Liyan] appeared in [Zhou Yuwen]'s room, contrary to his usual behavior. He lowered his head and passed through the carved wooden door of the outer room, slowly walking into the inner room.
1:32:56|1:33:17|The half-height round mirror on the dressing table reflected her figure. After looking around, she finally sat in front of the dressing table. The room of [Zhou Yuwen] was decorated very elegantly, with orchids growing well on the shelf and a delicate teapot on the small table, all showing the elegance and knowledge of the room's owner.
1:33:17|1:33:22|[Dai Liyan] observed the surroundings, lowering his head to look at the cosmetics placed on the dressing table.
1:33:23|1:33:40|Suddenly reaching out and picking up the snow cream with a beauty image on it, she inadvertently skillfully twisted open the lid, sniffed it at the tip of her nose, and the strong fragrance made her cough uncontrollably. She had to tighten the snow cream and put it back in place, then slowly got up after taking a round in the room, walking through the tall screen to the inner room.
1:33:41|1:34:1|The room was not large, with nothing but a bed. Dai Liyan sat at the edge of the bed, carefully examining, as if trying to engrave them deeply into his mind. The thin gauze curtains by the bed fluttered in the wind, and Dai Liyan gazed at them foolishly. After a while, he slowly got up and left through the back door of the factory.
1:34:2|1:34:18|He walked slowly along the corridor, his arms straight down by his side, his eyes staring blankly at the road, looking absent-minded. The sunlight shone on him, not adding any vitality to his figure, but making him appear even more lonely and desolate.
1:34:19|1:34:35|He slowly moved his feet until his figure gradually disappeared at the end of the carved corridor. The scene shifted, and Dai Liyan had returned to his own room. He walked to the cabinet, reaching into the second drawer to search for something. When he turned around again, he was already holding a small medicine bottle in his hand.
1:34:36|1:34:51|His movements were extremely slow, like an old man who had weathered many storms. He slowly walked to the small table by the bed, raised his hand to pour himself a glass of water, and then came to the bedside, slowly sitting down with the help of the table. After sitting down, he unscrewed the medicine bottle.
1:34:52|1:35:11|The sound of the flower dropping a pill, she did not count how many pills were in her hand at the moment, perhaps she herself did not know how many she needed to take. She held the pills in her hand without haste, first carefully surveying the old and quaint little house, then looking up at the ceiling in a leisurely manner.
1:35:11|1:35:18|After doing all this, she suddenly put the pill into her mouth, took the water on the small table, drank a big mouthful, and then put down the water glass.
1:35:20|1:35:31|After all this, he slumped his shoulders heavily as if he had no strength left in his body. He sat on the bed like a mud sculpture for a long time, without any other movement.
1:35:35|1:35:49|After an unknown amount of time, she slowly reached out and lowered the raised bed curtain. The curtain fell apart with Dai Liyan's movement, allowing the sunlight to shine through the window into the room, only to be blocked back by the scattered curtain.
1:35:49|1:36:4|She gazed blankly at the untied curtain, slowly stood up from the bed, and moved to another corner where the curtain was still tied. She gently untied the curtain. As the curtain was slowly untied, there was no hope of even a glimmer of light in the completely sealed bed.
1:36:6|1:36:12|[Dai Liyan] didn't care. She slowly drew back the curtain and ran towards the desperate world she had created with her own hands, without hesitation.
1:36:15|1:36:33|Outside the Dai Family Courtyard, the sun was already high in the sky, but there was not a soul in the small town, only the scene of dilapidated walls and ruins silently announcing the loneliness and decay of the city. [Zhou Yuwen] appeared on the street with a basket in hand, but did not bring much vitality to this lonely alley.
1:36:33|1:36:40|The desolate wind tousled his hair as he slowly took his steps, disappearing into the old courtyard of [Dai Liyan]'s house.
1:36:42|1:37:0|In the courtyard at home, [Lao Huang] carried a wooden tray and walked along the carved corridor towards the agent's room. He skillfully crossed the high threshold of the outer room and walked quietly towards the inner room. The room was empty, with no sign of the agent. [Lao Huang] looked around in confusion, but found nothing.
1:37:0|1:37:6|He slowly placed the tray in his hand on the small table, smiled lightly at the bed surrounded by curtains.
1:37:13|1:37:15|Seeing no response, [Lao Huang] pulled back the bed curtain.
1:37:20|1:37:31|[Lao Huang] half of his body leaned into the bed, calling out for the agent loudly. [Lao Huang] realized that something was wrong, and ran outside in a slight panic.
1:38:6|1:38:16|[Zhou Yuwen] quickly pulled back the bed curtain, sat on the bed and leaned forward to observe the situation of the proxy. Suddenly, he saw a bottle of sleeping pills on the small table at the head of the proxy's bed.
1:38:18|1:38:37|He reached out for the medicine bottle, tightly grasped it in his hand, and then continued to look at the agent, afraid of missing any reaction from him. The agent was still deeply asleep. [Zhou Yuwen] finally couldn't control his emotions, tears falling from his eyes. [Zhang Zhichen] took big strides over the high threshold and rushed into a room like the wind.
1:38:37|1:38:41|[Zhou Yuwen] saw him coming and quickly got up to hand him the bottle of sleeping pills in her hand.
1:38:42|1:38:59|[Zhang Zhichen] took the medicine bottle, glanced down, and quickly ran towards the lying Dai Liyan on the bed. [Zhang Zhichen] felt Dai Liyan's pulse, then reached out to touch the artery, carefully examining Dai Liyan's current physical condition. He turned on the bedside lamp, preparing to conduct further examinations.
1:39:6|1:39:18|Zhang Zhichen opened Dai Liyan's eyelids and observed. They together laid the agent flat on Zhang Zhichen's legs. Zhang Zhichen clasped his hands together and vigorously patted the agent's back.
1:39:22|1:39:31|[Zhou Yuwen] quickly turned around and took a pair of rubber gloves from Zhang Zhichen's suitcase. After getting them, she handed them non-stop to Zhang Zhichen, who was helping the agent induce vomiting.
1:39:40|1:39:55|Zhang Zhichen hesitated for a moment. As Zhang Zhichen performed the rescue actions, Dai Liyan spat out some sleeping pills. Zhang Zhichen continued to vigorously pat the agent's back, but the agent didn't spit out anything else.
1:39:55|1:40:7|[Zhou Yuwen] quickly took out a handkerchief and carefully wiped the agent's face, then the two of them together laid the agent back on the bed. Compared to [Zhou Yuwen]'s anxiousness, Doctor Zhang Zhichen's calm and composed demeanor was evident at this moment.
1:40:8|1:40:23|After helping the agent back to bed, he took off the rubber gloves and calmly tidied up the first aid kit. [Zhou Yuwen], on the other hand, appeared a bit flustered, pacing back and forth by the agent's bed, twisting a handkerchief in his hand, with a constant sighing motion.
1:40:23|1:40:34|He bent down and sat beside Dai Liyan, his fingers tangled together and constantly spinning. Sometimes he checked Dai Liyan's pulse, sometimes he reached out to touch Dai Liyan's cheek, looking anxious and helpless.
1:40:37|1:40:46|In the moment of silence between them, the sound of footsteps suddenly came from outside the door. It turned out to be [Lao Huang] bringing the school's little sister back. The little sister rushed into the room like a gust of wind.
1:41:6|1:41:9|[Zhang Zhichen] walks towards Little Sister.
1:41:17|1:41:20|Zhou Yuwen looked helplessly at [Zhang Zhichen].
1:41:28|1:41:31|[Zhang Zhichen] walked away dejectedly, while the two sisters continued to cry out.
1:41:40|1:41:50|It's already night, but the courtyard is not as quiet as usual. The lights are still on, and the whole family is gathered in the room of [Dai Liyan], unable to close their eyes.
1:41:50|1:42:1|The agent was still not awake, and Dai Xiaomei was a little tired, half-leaning in front of the bed but forcing herself not to sleep. [Zhang Zhichen] sat at the table, rubbing the dust off the sun, his exquisite suit all wrinkled.
1:42:1|1:42:15|[Zhou Yuwen] sat at the foot of the bed, staring fixedly at the agent, not wanting to miss any of his reactions. No one spoke, breaking the tense atmosphere. Everyone's thoughts followed the agent's every move, maintaining an eerie calm in the room.
1:42:15|1:42:21|Lao Huang walked in from outside with a hot towel, shook his head, and slowly approached Zhou Yuwen, whispering softly.
1:42:25|1:42:39|[Zhou Yuwen] heard the sound but didn't turn around. She raised her hand and pushed aside the tray handed over by [Lao Huang], staring at Dai Liyan in a trance, without even looking at [Lao Huang] with her peripheral vision. The younger sister and the older sister stared blankly at their brother with closed eyes, so [Lao Huang] had to leave.
1:42:42|1:42:50|[Zhang Zhichen] was brought back to reality by the voice of [Lao Huang]. He took the hot towel handed to him by [Lao Huang], casually wiped his hands, and then passed the towel back to [Lao Huang].
1:42:50|1:43:5|At this moment, the previously quiet agent made a move, surprising Dai Xiaomei who raised her arm in shock. Zhou Yuwen quickly leaned over, and Dai Xiaomei exclaimed in surprise at the agent.
1:43:5|1:43:22|Three people stood around the agent's bed, as the agent slowly woke up and turned his head to look at them. [Zhou Yuwen] and [Zhang Zhichen] exchanged a glance, and [Zhang Zhichen] nodded at her. Dai Liyan turned his head and slowly looked towards Zhou Yuwen at the foot of the bed.
1:43:29|1:43:39|Dai Liyan closed her eyes and slowly nodded. Zhou Yuwen held Dai Liyan's hand, leaning helplessly against the bed, unable to hold back her tears.
1:43:44|1:43:48|Her emotions finally erupted, crying as she leaned towards [Dai Liyan].
1:43:55|1:44:7|Dai Liyan's voice gradually softened as he looked down at Zhou Yuwen leaning against his chest, reaching out to gently stroke Zhou Yuwen's embroidered hair. Dai Xiaomei, seeing her brother wake up, slowly relaxed her tense expression.
1:44:9|1:44:20|A new day begins. Outside the gate of the Dai family courtyard, [Lao Huang] skillfully empties the medicine residue from the pot onto the small path outside the gate, then slowly walks back into the courtyard with the empty pot and closes the gate. Inside the house, [Zhou Yuwen] is helping Dai Xiaomei, who is dressed in new clothes, to carefully dress up.
1:44:41|1:45:2|Dai Xiaomei's face did not show any joy. She looked up at Zhou Yuwen in the mirror. Zhou Yuwen paused in surprise at her rejection. After a moment of contemplation, Dai Xiaomei turned around and took Zhou Yuwen's hand.
1:45:11|1:45:26|Upon hearing Dai Xiaomei's straightforward question, [Zhou Yuwen] paused for a moment, then turned Dai Xiaomei's shoulder and guided her back to sit in front of the dressing table. Both of their expressions were somewhat subtle, and Dai Xiaomei realized she had spoken out of turn. She opened her mouth to explain but remained silent.
1:45:26|1:45:31|[Zhou Yuwen] sighed and didn't even look at her, carefully combing Dai Xiaomei's short hair with a comb.
1:45:33|1:45:49|The two of them fell silent for a long time because of Dai Xiaomei's earlier slip of the tongue. Dai Xiaomei stared straight at the mirror where [Zhou Yuwen] was combing her hair for her. [Zhou Yuwen]'s expression became increasingly sorrowful. Finally, she couldn't help but feel desolate, as if she was no longer as calm as before. She hurriedly turned and ran towards the table at the door.
1:45:53|1:46:8|Tears finally fell, Dai Xiaomei looked at Zhou Yuwen crying in the corner, feeling a bit guilty as she lowered her head. At the city gate, Dai Xiaomei, who was already dressed up, was sending medicine back to Shanghai with Lao Huang and Zhang Zhichen.
1:46:8|1:46:15|As they reached the city gate, [Zhang Zhichen] reached out and stopped him, wanting to continue escorting his younger sister Dai Xiu forward.
1:46:25|1:46:36|The eldest and youngest sisters chatted and laughed as they walked slowly towards the outskirts of the city. The three of them strolled leisurely, with [Zhou Yuwen] lost in thought.
1:46:41|1:46:58|Zhang Zhichen half embraced Dai Liyan's shoulder, Lao Huang carried the suitcase, slowly following behind them. The three of them talked like this, slowly walking towards the car door. In the Dai family courtyard, Dai Xiu was struggling to trim the saplings with her head up. Zhang Zhichen came down from the second floor, and Dai Xiu said to him.
1:46:59|1:47:6|[Dai Xiu] paused and waited for [Zhang Zhichen] to walk down the stairs and stand beside him. After a moment of thought, he continued speaking.
1:47:12|1:47:14|He put down the wrongly cut branches and continued speaking.
1:47:26|1:47:42|[Zhou Yuwen] did not answer [Dai Xiu], but just looked up silently at her trimming actions, seeing her sweating a little. [Zhou Yuwen] took out a handkerchief from her side and handed it to [Dai Liyan]. [Dai Liyan] took the handkerchief, wiped the sweat on his forehead, and then returned the handkerchief to him.
1:47:42|1:47:46|[Zhou Yuwen] took the handkerchief, turned around and prepared to leave, reminding Dai Liyan.
1:47:55|1:48:0|Dai Liyan, after listening to Zhou Yuwen's instructions, looked somewhat excited and continued to trim the nearby saplings.
1:48:3|1:48:21|[Zhou Yuwen] turned and walked up the corridor, then climbed the stairs to the attic. Sitting down on a bench by the attic window, [Zhou Yuwen] picked up the embroidery frame from the basket and started embroidering. The slender silver needle moved back and forth on the silk cloth in his hand, gradually shaping the embroidery. Perhaps he was feeling a bit tired.
1:48:21|1:48:28|He leaned back against the chair and took a rest, then continued to lower his head and embroider flowers. Suddenly, the train whistle broke the silence.
1:48:34|1:48:48|[Zhou Yuwen] slowly raised her head with the sound of the steam whistle, her gaze somewhat absent-minded, casually looking ahead without any surprise or shock. It was only a moment later that she snapped out of it, focusing intently on embroidering in the lingering light of the spring sunset.
1:48:48|1:48:56|In the garden, Zhou Yuwen heard the sound of a train whistle, sighed faintly, raised her hand to trim a branch, and then had no further reaction.
1:49:0|1:49:17|The sound of the train running came closer from a distance, then gradually faded away. As the train roared away, the small town returned to silence, with [Zhou Yuwen] still sitting by the window in the attic embroidering. Everything became quiet again, as if nothing had ever happened.
1:49:17|1:49:31|Outside the small town, the city walls are still covered with thatch, even though it is already spring, there is no sign of spring at all. Perhaps spring has never come, or perhaps it has already come and quietly left.
