0:3:12|0:3:20|In the alley, two little boys walked hand in hand to the entrance of the grocery store. The younger brother, Xiaochong, excitedly stopped in front of the freezer.
0:3:27|0:3:51|Brother [A Xuan] held his younger brother Xiaochong's hand and walked into the grocery store, where the owner was dozing off. [A Xuan] quietly opened the small cash drawer. Xiaochong accidentally made a noise, and [A Xuan] quickly took out a few banknotes. Before leaving, Xiaochong couldn't resist opening the freezer. At that moment, the owner woke up.
0:3:57|0:4:23|The boss chased after the two of them, scolding as they ran. They accidentally knocked down an old lady along the way. Xiao Chong helped the old lady up and apologized to her. The boss grabbed Xiao Chong from behind, and [A Xuan] threw a stone hitting the boss's head, allowing Xiao Chong to escape.
0:4:28|0:4:33|The two sat on high steps eating popsicles, with the vast sea in front of them.
0:4:56|0:5:12|Unconsciously, the little bug has grown up. He pulls back the curtains and looks outside with determination. With his backpack on, he is ready to go out when his father asks.
0:5:26|0:5:37|Dad took out a trophy from the cabinet and placed it in front of Little Worm. Dad then threw the trophy on the ground.
0:5:50|0:6:12|Dad pointed at the chest of the little bug with his finger, but the bug argued back. The bug turned and ran out of the house, making Dad angrily wave his fist. On the high school playground, the track team was training, and [Zhou Yiqing] rode a motorcycle straight to the edge of the track and stopped.
0:6:14|0:6:26|Coach Pan saw him and signaled the players to stop. The players greeted Coach Pan. Zhou Yiqing took off his helmet and walked to [Coach Pan]'s side.
0:7:30|0:7:35|The little bug took out a marathon poster from the backpack and continued to stare at [A Xuan], asking.
0:7:57|0:8:11|[A Xuan] pushed the little bug to the ground, gave him a fierce look, then turned and ran to training. At that moment, [Fang Chongyu] walked over and reached out a hand to the bug. Seeing the scar on [Fang Chongyu]'s arm, the bug stood up on its own.
0:8:17|0:8:32|He looked towards the direction of the track team training. Zhou Yiqing watched him attentively, lost in thought. The track team ran over, and the chubby one in the front kicked the little bug's backpack on the track to the side.
0:8:36|0:8:39|Zhou Yiqing tries to grab the angry little bug, but the bug shakes off his hand.
0:8:58|0:9:10|Little [Chong] took advantage of the chaos and ran away, and [Coach Pan] ran over.
0:9:15|0:9:19|[Zhou Yiqing] walked up to the coach and looked in the direction where Xiao Chong ran off.
0:10:20|0:10:43|Fang Chongyu was amused by Coach Pan's words. The smile on Fang Chongyu's face disappeared instantly. Fang Chongyu turned and shouted at the team members. The team members sitting on the ground stood up indignantly.
0:11:0|0:11:23|With [Fang Chongyu] and the team watching, the two stood at the starting line. Xiaochong pulled [Zhou Yiqing] to the inside of the track, and [Zhou Yiqing] smiled as she accepted her gentlemanly gesture. [A Xuan] walked up to advise Xiaochong. [A Xuan] did not follow his brother's advice. [Zhou Yiqing] got into position for the race.
0:11:27|0:11:49|At the beginning, Xiao Chong took the lead, but the two did not open up a big gap. [A Xuan] noticed that Xiao Chong did not stand inside the circle, furrowing his brows. In the final sprint stage, [Zhou Yiqing] started to exert force, Xiao Chong struggled and was overtaken by [Zhou Yiqing], with teammates applauding and cheering.
0:11:49|0:12:20|[Zhou Yiqing], who crossed the finish line, covered her chest and gasped for breath. [A Xuan] walked over and patted Xiaochong's shoulder. After calming his breath, he turned around and jingled the keys. Xiaochong was still unwilling, [A Xuan] put his arm around his shoulder. Xiaochong pushed [A Xuan] away and took a few steps forward on his own.
0:12:20|0:12:23|[A Xuan] looked at the little bug and left helplessly.
0:12:25|0:12:32|On the way home, [Fang Chongyu] sat on the back of [Zhou Yiqing]'s motorcycle and vented. [Fang Chongyu] jumped off the motorcycle, and [Zhou Yiqing] quickly hit the brakes.
0:12:56|0:13:14|[Zhou Yiqing] got off the car and watched as Xiaochong's figure, with a crutch in one hand and a fist in the other, the wind tousled her hair, covering half of her face. She made up her mind and shouted at Xiaochong.
0:13:31|0:13:48|[Zhou Yiqing] got on the motorcycle, turned around and threw a line, then changed the direction of the motorcycle and roared away. The bug with a helmet on shouted and chased after the motorcycle.
0:13:57|0:14:6|Back at school, [Zhou Yiqing] cleared out a bit of space in the storage room for Xiaochong. Seeing Xiaochong return panting, [Zhou Yiqing] said.
0:14:18|0:14:39|[Zhou Yiqing] gave the little bug a glance, crouched down to strike a match, and lit an incense stick. The little bug's gaze fell on [Zhou Yiqing]'s mouth, ears, and eyes, causing the corners of its mouth to unconsciously curl up. [Zhou Yiqing] looked up at the little bug, which quickly averted its gaze.
0:14:40|0:14:53|[Zhou Yiqing] blew out the match and stood up to walk to the left, the little bug also went left. When [Zhou Yiqing] went right, the bug followed suit. Their strange tacit understanding made the atmosphere a bit ambiguous. The bug sidled up to the table and sat down.
0:14:54|0:15:11|[Zhou Yiqing] turned around and threw a pillow at him. [Zhou Yiqing] smiled as she turned around, watching him leave with her small bug-like eyes. At night, [A Xuan] knocked on the window of his girlfriend Xiao Ke.
0:15:15|0:15:17|[A Xuan] lay on the bed and complained.
0:15:59|0:16:17|[A Xuan] brought the pregnancy test stick in Xiao Ke's hand to his eyes. [A Xuan] froze. In the early morning, [Zhou Yiqing] trained with Xiao Chong on the mountain path. After the training, Xiao Chong stretched her legs in pain, while [Zhou Yiqing] read a book and pressed on her back.
0:16:33|0:16:48|The little bug didn't hold steady, causing [Zhou Yiqing] to almost fall. [Zhou Yiqing] extended her right index finger and poked it on her forehead.
0:17:1|0:17:18|Zhou Yiqing pulled the bug's hand away from her forehead. She gave a signal, and the bug maliciously smiled, releasing her fingers and sitting down. Zhou Yiqing picked up a stick and hit the bug with it.
0:17:24|0:17:51|Little Worm reluctantly got up and was about to bend down when [Zhou Yiqing] immediately stopped him. [Zhou Yiqing] looked at Little Worm's worn-out sneakers and asked. [Zhou Yiqing] furrowed her brow, lost in thought.
0:17:56|0:18:22|At night, in the office, [Zhou Yiqing] takes out a shoebox from the drawer. Inside the box is a pair of red sneakers. She lovingly caresses the red sneakers, thinking of her brother.
0:18:50|0:18:54|Yiqing Zhou looked at Little Worm, whose clothes were already half soaked with sweat.
0:19:10|0:19:23|In an old and gloomy building, Fang Chongyu took Xiao Ke to see the quack doctor for an abortion. Xiao Ke clung tightly to Fang Chongyu's arm in fear. They walked through the dilapidated corridor. Fang Chongyu knocked on the door of the clinic.
0:19:43|0:19:49|[Fang Chongyu] sat by the hospital bed, and the strange doctor walked over to him and said.
0:19:59|0:20:25|Xiao Ke watched [A Xuan] leave with tears in his eyes. The strange doctor sat down. Outside the clinic, [A Xuan] closed the door, regretfully pounding the wall and holding back tears. After a moment of inner struggle, he rushed back in, picked Xiao Ke up from the sickbed. The strange doctor shouted.
0:20:31|0:20:56|[A Xuan] sat on the bed in Xiaoke's house, Xiaoke's father was emotional. Xiaoke's dad closed the door, sat across from [A Xuan], Xiaoke and his mom opened a crack in the door, peeking outside anxiously. They locked eyes for a moment, and [A Xuan] spoke sincerely.
0:20:59|0:21:22|Dad angrily beats [A Xuan], Xiao Ke and Mom rush in to stop him. Dad pushes Xiao Ke away, [A Xuan] quickly rushes over, Xiao Ke holds his stomach, [A Xuan] helps Xiao Ke to a chair. Xiao Ke shakes his head and hugs [A Xuan].
0:21:25|0:21:40|From this moment on, older brother [A Xuan] will shoulder the responsibility of the family, while younger brother Xiaochong can still pursue his dreams without any worries. In the mountains and forests, Xiaochong crosses muddy swamps and overcomes numerous obstacles.
0:21:40|0:21:55|On the beach, Little Worm tied a rope around his waist and dragged a heavy tire to practice hard. He swung his arms with force, his eyes determined. After a while, Little Worm ran on the road, with [Zhou Yiqing] riding a motorcycle beside him, timing.
0:22:12|0:22:21|The little bug continued to run forward, and before long, it accidentally fell down. [Zhou Yiqing] stopped the car, took off the helmet, and walked over to check the injury.
0:22:28|0:22:33|Zhou Yiqing frowned as she looked at his bleeding knee.
0:22:46|0:23:13|Yiqing disdainfully punched Xiaochong, then turned to get a first aid kit from the motorcycle and handed it to Xiaochong. Xiaochong unzipped it and searched inside. Yiqing treated Xiaochong's wound. Xiaochong winced in pain, gritting his teeth. Xiaochong poked his forehead with his right index finger.
0:23:13|0:23:17|Yiqing looked at [Zhou Yiqing], untied his shoelace, and tied it to the gauze.
0:23:23|0:23:51|Previously, [Fang Chongyu] deliberately tied a knot tightly, patted the small bug's leg. The small bug stood up and approached, the two looked at each other awkwardly. The small bug took a step back.
0:23:59|0:24:23|Zhou Yiqing gets on the motorcycle and puts on a helmet. She starts the motorcycle and leaves. Xiao Chong takes a few steps forward and shouts. Zhou Yiqing parks the motorcycle at the entrance of the orphanage, with Xiao Chong quietly following behind her.
0:24:25|0:24:36|Yiqing noticed that someone seemed to be following her from behind, but when she turned around, she saw no one. She walked to the outside of the classroom, where a few children ran out from the classroom, and the principal followed out and reminded them.
0:24:49|0:24:52|Xiaomi saw the little bug, and Yiqing asked.
0:24:58|0:25:21|Xiaomi grabbed Yiqing, who leaned forward and whispered to Xiaomi. At Xiaoke's home, [A Xuan] leaned his head against Xiaoke's belly, shaking a plush teddy bear in his hand and talking to the baby inside the belly. Xiaoke took out a roll of money from behind the teddy bear.
0:25:34|0:25:37|[A Xuan] stood up and responded helplessly.
0:25:54|0:26:19|Xiao Ke turned his head angrily, and [A Xuan] also stubbornly didn't answer. Xiao Chong was dressed in formal attire, holding a white rose, and came to meet Yiqing's invitation. Walking to the entrance of the restaurant, [Zhou Yiqing] was adjusting her clothes in front of the glass. [Zhou Yiqing] and Xiao Mi inside saw this scene and smiled at each other.
0:26:20|0:26:40|The little bug was outside the door, practicing what to say when meeting. After finishing, he sighed, and [Zhou Yiqing] and Xiao Mi pushed open the door, trying to hold back their laughter. Yi Qin introduced Xiao Mi.
0:26:46|0:27:9|Xiaomi and Xiaochong made a secret gesture, [Zhou Yiqing] smiled and turned to enter the room, while Xiaochong took two steps and then returned to close the door. Xiaomi used her fingers to smear cream on Xiaochong's nose, and [Zhou Yiqing] joined in the fun. Xiaomi put the two people's hands together, patted Xiaochong's arm and said.
0:27:9|0:27:13|After Xiao Mi finished speaking and ran off, Xiao Chong smiled foolishly, and [Zhou Yiqing] reminded him.
0:27:20|0:27:35|Fang Chongyu held Zhou Yiqing's right hand with his left hand, his right hand around her waist, while Zhou Yiqing's left hand rested on Fang Chongyu's right shoulder. They smiled and danced sweetly to the music. Xiaomi watched the two from a distance, also smiling happily.
0:27:48|0:28:7|As soon as the words fell, [Zhou Yiqing] stepped on a small bug. As the night grew darker, the beautiful date was coming to an end. [Zhou Yiqing] carried the sleeping Xiaomi on her back, and the bug opened his coat to shield Xiaomi from the wind. The bug looked at [Zhou Yiqing] and asked.
0:28:30|0:28:36|In the past, he was immersed in memories, with his short ponytail walking slowly into the classroom.
0:28:39|0:28:54|Xiaomi, who was drawing, stopped her hand movements and stared intently at the wing-shaped scar on Zhou Yiqing's chest, then suddenly burst into a happy smile. She ran over and hugged Zhou Yiqing tightly.
0:28:55|0:28:57|[Zhou Yiqing] was startled.
0:29:8|0:29:35|Xiaomi happily embraced Yiqing. Yiqing also hugged her. At this moment, Xiaomi woke up. Come, A Xuan put the coat on Xiaomi and looked at her tenderly.
0:29:48|0:30:8|The little bug watched as [Zhou Yiqing] embraced Xiao Mi, waving the white rose in one hand. The bug happily turned away, making a fist with the right hand in a celebratory gesture. Time flew by, and before they knew it, the child of Xiao Ke and A Xuan was born.
0:30:8|0:30:14|In the hospital, they cuddled together, Xiao Ke took the baby, and the two happily looked at their daughter.
0:30:20|0:30:36|The doctor reminded [A Xuan] of the precautions, and he thought about the increasing expenses of family life, his face gradually becoming serious. He had to come back to that strange and rundown clinic once again. The eccentric doctor said,
0:30:49|0:31:6|In the grocery store, [Fang Chongyu] practiced marching while shopping. The store owner pointed to his own head, thinking that [Fang Chongyu] was not quite right in the head. Meanwhile, as [A Xuan] was being chased by robbers and passed by the grocery store, [Fang Chongyu] saw him. Dropping the items in his hands, [Fang Chongyu] turned and ran out to chase after [A Xuan].
0:31:6|0:31:13|The owner and his wife of the grocery store curiously walked to the door to watch. Outside, two or three bandits were chasing after [A Xuan].
0:31:15|0:31:44|[A Xuan] vaulted over the wall and crawled through a hole with agile movements, while the bandits were entangled by [Xiao Chong] following closely behind. The bandits noticed someone suddenly appearing on the road and mistook them for [A Xuan]'s accomplice, launching an attack from behind. [Xiao Chong] knocked them down one by one and continued to chase after [A Xuan]. Seizing the opportunity, [A Xuan] jumped down from the hidden path and intercepted [Xiao Chong], who mistakenly thought he was also a bandit and pressed him firmly against the wall.
0:31:46|0:31:51|The light from the street lamp allowed [A Xuan] to see [Little Bug]. [A Xuan] let go of his hand and asked.
0:31:57|0:32:1|[A Xuan] took out a box of medicine from his pocket and shook it.
0:32:22|0:32:42|[A Xuan] turned around to leave, but [Xiao Chong] snatched the medicine and spilled all the pills on the ground. [A Xuan] fiercely hit [Xiao Chong] and then took his wallet from him.
0:32:44|0:33:9|[A Xuan] took the money, threw the empty bag to [Fang Chongyu], and ran away. [Fang Chongyu] clenched his fist in anger and hit the wall. In the school storage room, [Fang Chongyu] sat on the bed, staring blankly at the poster of the international marathon on the headboard. [Zhou Yiqing] pushed the door open and knocked on the frame.
0:33:12|0:33:41|[Fang Chongyu] hurriedly puts on his pants. [Zhou Yiqing] hands him a registration form. [Fang Chongyu] opens his arms, wanting to hug [Zhou Yiqing]. Yiqing twists Fang Chongyu's wrist and throws him to the ground.
0:33:43|0:34:1|The little bug crawled up and saw Zhou Yiqing's shoes. It asked about them. The bug wrapped the shoelace that Zhou Yiqing used to bandage his wound around his wrist. Zhou Yiqing reached out to take it, but the bug dodged.
0:34:2|0:34:4|Yiqing held the pair of red shoes in her hands.
0:34:11|0:34:34|Little Worm had just taken out his new shoes, but Yiqing left. Little Worm looked puzzledly at the door. On a rainy day, Little Worm was practicing on the runway with one fist and one crutch, and accidentally fell. Yiqing walked out, just opened the umbrella, and saw Little Worm lying on the ground, she ran over.
0:34:38|0:35:1|Yiqing held an umbrella in one hand and struggled to help up a small insect with the other. She dropped the umbrella and used both hands to carry the insect to the relic room. The doctor looked at [Fang Chongyu] and said.
0:35:33|0:35:35|Zhou Yiqing raised her hand, but didn't strike down. After Zhou Yiqing finished speaking, she turned around and left.
0:36:3|0:36:17|The next day at the competition venue, the contestants were actively warming up. Xiao Chong and [A Xuan] locked eyes, and [A Xuan] smirked, indicating Xiao Chong to pay attention to the tall and muscular black contestant in front of them.
0:36:17|0:36:36|The little bug's left knee and calf were wrapped in bandages, he gritted his teeth and looked at the friends and family in the periphery, but did not see the familiar figure. Fang Chongyu used his right index finger to press against his forehead, just like he was taught by his mentor, he walked to the front row and waited for the match to begin.
0:36:36|0:36:51|The starting gun went off, amidst the cheers of the friends and family on both sides, the contestants ran forward at their own pace. Perhaps it was Xiao Yan's influence, Fang Chongyu started off running at the front, with steady steps and even breathing, as if he hadn't been injured at all.
0:36:56|0:37:13|Not long after, [A Xuan] easily caught up and turned to him tirelessly. Little Bug gritted his teeth to overtake [A Xuan], who then accelerated past Little Bug. In a marathon that tests endurance, working together side by side undoubtedly makes it easier.
0:37:13|0:37:19|[A Xuan] accompanies and motivates Xiao Chong in his own way, running alongside him to the midway water station.
0:37:21|0:37:27|In the latter part of the competition, [A Xuan] noticed that the speed of the little bug was slowing down, and the black competitor caught up.
0:37:32|0:37:40|The little bug was in increasing pain and found it harder to walk. The chubby bully, who was plotting revenge, caught up from behind and intentionally knocked the bug down.
0:37:45|0:38:6|[A Xuan] heard these words, looked back uneasily, and saw the fallen bug. She stopped, hesitated. She made up her mind, turned around and pushed the chubby kid out of the track. She gave him a beating. The bug gritted his teeth, stood up, roared, and continued to run forward limping.
0:38:17|0:38:43|The little bug tried hard to catch up with one contestant after another, but his injuries were too severe. He hadn't run far before he fell again. He curled up in pain on the ground, looking despairingly at his bleeding left leg, unable to stand up. At that moment, [Zhou Yiqing] walked over and reached out a hand to him, just like they had first met on the playground.
0:38:43|0:38:45|The little bug looked up at [Zhou Yiqing].
0:39:9|0:39:16|The black contestant reached the finish line first amidst the cheers and applause from the audience. The second place went to [A Xuan].
0:39:18|0:39:28|The staff draped a towel over [A Xuan], who watched the black athlete and his family celebrating nearby. Feeling unwilling, [A Xuan] angrily threw the towel on the ground.
0:39:34|0:39:38|In the school storage room, [Zhou Yiqing] helps to secure the bracket for the small insect.
0:39:53|0:39:57|Previously, Fang Chongyu glanced at the little bug and then lowered his head in silence.
0:40:40|0:40:45|The little bug sighed and looked into [Zhou Yiqing]'s eyes, asking.
0:40:59|0:41:1|The epidemic bowed its head and pulled up the zipper of the medical bag.
0:41:25|0:41:41|The little bug rolled up Zhou Yiqing's sleeve and ran its finger over the scar. The bug paused, and Zhou Yiqing stared into its eyes.
0:41:45|0:42:8|Xiao Chong and [Zhou Yiqing] gazed deeply into each other's eyes, slowly moving closer until their foreheads touched. After a moment, Xiao Chong furrowed his brow, turned his head away from [Zhou Yiqing], and let out a sigh.
0:42:23|0:42:36|[Zhou Yiqing] watched as the little bug writhed in pain, tears streaming down from the corner of her eyes.
0:42:41|0:42:43|[Zhou Yiqing] reached out her hand and gently touched the insect's cheek.
0:42:50|0:43:13|Embracing the neck of the little bug with affection, their foreheads pressed closely together. Late at night, Fang Chongyu was running outside alone, using the mechanical swinging of arms and the pulsing of veins as an outlet for emotions.
0:43:20|0:43:45|Fang Chongyu knelt down on the ground, covering her chest and crying uncontrollably after running for who knows how long. The darkness seemed to swallow all the sadness, helplessness, and farewells. The cicadas were still chirping, the lights were still on, and the city at night was as calm as a dream.
0:43:51|0:44:9|Early the next morning, [Zhou Yiqing] waited for the train at the station with a backpack. Back on campus, [Xiao Chong] limped into the office and found [Zhou Yiqing]'s desk empty.
0:44:53|0:45:5|[Little Bug] rushed out, at this moment, [Fang Chongyu]'s train arrived. [Little Bug] ran desperately towards the train station.
0:45:11|0:45:23|[Mi Qing] sat on the train, holding the shoebox with her little brother's crooked handwriting on it, saying "I want to become the world's number one."
0:45:27|0:45:35|[Little Bug] finally arrived at the train station, but the train had already started moving. She stumbled and chased after it, but could only watch as the train went further away.
0:45:41|0:45:47|[Little Worm] returned home in a daze, only to find his father's taxi parked outside. Inside the house, his sick father was lying down receiving an IV drip.
0:46:15|0:46:24|Dad struggled to sit up. [Zhou Yiqing] angrily turned and walked away.
0:46:39|0:46:59|[Zhou Yiqing] walked to the door, her father was still waiting inside. She walked to the taxi, looking at the old car. She stood by the rolled-down window for a long time, and finally decided to follow her father's path by driving a taxi to make a living.
0:47:4|0:47:14|In the countless days and nights that followed, [Zhou Yiqing] lived a mundane life as a taxi driver.
0:47:27|0:47:47|[Chongyu Fang], who left without saying goodbye, was weighed down by the heavy realities of her brother not winning the championship, her father's illness, and the injury to her left leg. Long-distance running seemed to have become an unreachable dream hidden deep in her heart.
0:47:47|0:47:52|One day, [Zhou Yiqing] went out to pick up passengers as usual, when suddenly the passenger in the back seat spoke.
0:47:54|0:48:22|[Zhou Yiqing] immediately hit the brakes, causing the passenger to bump into the front seat. The passenger impatiently paid and got off the car. [Zhou Yiqing] picked up the magazine left by the passenger, which was the 1994 issue of "Runner's World". The cover featured a preview of the 7-day ultra marathon in the American canyon. As a new passenger boarded the car, [Zhou Yiqing] put away the magazine. Sorry for the trouble, thank you.
0:48:25|0:48:38|The passenger in the back seat was the then unknown [Jay Chou]. As the car accelerated, the cassette tape in [Jay Chou]'s hand slipped out.
0:48:57|0:49:23|Xiao Chong excitedly showed the magazine cover to [Zhou Yiqing]. He reached out to pick up the cassette tape and directly inserted it into the car's slot to start playing. Music started playing in the car. Xiao Chong smiled and continued driving. Soon after, he turned up the volume of the music.
0:49:25|0:49:44|[Zhou Yiqing] also began to carefully read the desert marathon event notice. That day, the sun was just right, and memories of the past flooded his mind, filled with the obsession of long-distance running dreams, as well as memories of his brother and coach from childhood.
0:49:54|0:50:3|[Zhou Yiqing] felt a bit embarrassed as the little bug handed him the cassette tape.
0:50:20|0:50:24|Jay Chou handed the magazine to [A Xuan].
0:50:29|0:50:32|Jay Chou only had some loose change in his pocket.
0:51:2|0:51:16|Jay Chou ran into the TV station. [Fang Chongyu] reignited his dream of running the desert marathon. In his spare time driving a taxi, he went to the hospital to take some shots and endured painful rehabilitation training.
0:51:29|0:51:31|To swim for physical fitness and lung capacity training.
0:51:38|0:51:46|He often recalls the words she used to say to him, poking his forehead with her finger.
0:52:12|0:52:36|One day, [Fang Chongyu] was reading a magazine in the car when suddenly, [A Xuan] rushed up and held a knife to his neck. [A Xuan] took off his sunglasses in surprise. A police car drove by, and [A Xuan] quickly lowered his head.
0:52:43|0:53:11|Suddenly, a heavy rain started pouring down. [A Xuan] got out of the car and began running desperately forward, with Xiaochong following behind and chasing after [A Xuan]. Xiaochong tackled [A Xuan], and the two wrestled in the mud pit. Xiaochong swung his fist but missed, and was then counterattacked by [A Xuan].
0:53:13|0:53:41|[A Xuan] handed a stack of money to Little Worm. Little Worm threw the money away, pushed [A Xuan] away, and stood up. [A Xuan] wiped the mud off his face. [A Xuan] pushed Little Worm down into the mud, and the two started fighting again.
0:53:54|0:54:0|Xiao Chong punched [A Xuan], and both of them fell into a mud pit.
0:54:11|0:54:13|The little bug landed heavily in the mud.
0:54:27|0:54:54|[A Xuan] reached out a hand to the little bug. The bug clenched its teeth and shouted, then grabbed [A Xuan]'s hand to stand up with effort. [A Xuan] embraced the bug in his arms. As the torrential rain poured down, it drowned out tears and screams, seemingly diluting some misunderstandings and hatred.
0:54:54|0:54:59|After the rain, the little bug worked together with [A Xuan].
0:55:10|0:55:30|[A Xuan] snatched the medicine box from Dr. Jia's hands, and his accomplice immediately rushed out to grab it. [A Xuan] threw the medicine box to Xiao Chong. Xiao Chong caught it, and the two quickly escaped after succeeding. Seeing the pursuers catching up to Xiao Chong, he threw the backpack to [A Xuan].
0:55:30|0:55:38|[A Xuan] with a backpack, Dr. Jia chased after him relentlessly. [A Xuan] jumped onto a rooftop, with Dr. Jia shouting loudly.
0:55:41|0:56:1|[A Xuan] stood on a high place and threw the backpack to Xiao Chong. Xiao Chong jumped up to catch the backpack and ran. The fake doctor took out a knife and stabbed towards [A Xuan]. [A Xuan] and the other person struggled with each other. He picked up a flower pot from the ground and smashed it towards them, gradually losing strength, and got a cut on his face by the knife.
0:56:3|0:56:31|Fang Chongyu left A Xuan behind to search for the bug with a backpack, they surrounded the bug from both sides. The bug had to grab the beam with his hands and jump to avoid them. Just as the backpack was about to be taken away, the bug kicked one of them with his hind leg, threw him off, and climbed back up to the platform to throw the backpack to A Xuan waiting below. A Xuan used the backpack to knock down the two opponents, then climbed to a higher place and pushed down the ladder, winning a moment to catch his breath.
0:56:38|0:57:0|On the other side, Xiaochong made a call to the police. Sergeant Fang Chongyu was outnumbered and unable to fight back, A Xuan was surrounded by the enemy. At this moment, the alarm bell rang loudly, and the enemy immediately fled. A Xuan smiled and leaned against the wall, lighting a cigarette for himself.
0:57:7|0:57:27|The little bug drove the car to a place not far from [A Xuan], where two people got on the car. One of the passengers turned out to be [Zhou Yiqing]. The little bug glanced at [Zhou Yiqing] in the rearview mirror, then looked at [A Xuan] being interrogated in the corner, gritted his teeth and started the car.
0:57:30|0:57:57|Yiqing recognized Xiaochong, kept looking ahead on the road, and the man beside her asked in confusion. Yiqing smoothed her hair and pretended nothing had happened. The man was amazed when he saw the magazine. The car stopped, and Yiqing said to the man.
0:57:59|0:58:26|Zhou Yiqing handed the money to Little Worm, who didn't take the money directly, but gently held Zhou Yiqing's hand. Zhou Yiqing looked at her affectionately. After a moment, Little Worm calmed down, released her hand, and took the money.
0:58:31|0:58:49|[Zhou Yiqing] placed the magazine on the passenger seat. The man walked to the car door and kindly closed it for her. After they took a few steps, [Zhou Yiqing] turned back and glanced once more.
0:58:55|0:59:23|The little bug looked at the backs of the two people, sadly pushed the money aside, picked up the magazine, and wanted to tear it all page by page. Suddenly, he found a page of the ultra marathon with a drawing of a broken bridge and the words "2 p.m. in the afternoon" below.
0:59:31|0:59:35|In the afternoon, [Fang Chongyu] ran to the broken bridge, leaning against the railing and gasping for breath.
0:59:43|0:59:57|[Zhou Yiqing], wearing a skirt instead of her usual sportswear, walks over from the other side of the bridge.
1:0:36|1:0:42|[Zhou Yiqing] took out a paper bag from her bag.
1:1:2|1:1:5|The little bug angrily questioned again.
1:1:21|1:1:23|The little bug tore open the paper bag and threw it on the ground.
1:1:49|1:1:51|Even if there was a real danger to his life, he still went for a run.
1:1:56|1:1:59|[Fang Chongyu] stood up and stared at the small bug.
1:2:17|1:2:34|After speaking, [A Xuan] turned his shoulder and quickly walked away, leaving Little Bug stunned. He decided to participate in the ultra marathon. In the desert, [Fang Chongyu] put on his sunglasses, looked at the endless sand dunes, and stood firmly at the starting line.
1:2:43|1:3:10|The starting gun went off, and the contestants cheered as they ran towards the finish line. Under the scorching sun, [Fang Chongyu] ran alone through the vast desert. Along the way, he teamed up with a foreigner named Charlie, and they heard the roar of an airplane above their heads, prompting them to stop and look up. Charlie raised his arms high, excitedly waving at the sky.
1:3:14|1:3:37|Charlie patted [Fang Chongyu]'s chest, and [Fang Chongyu] followed. It turned out that Charlie's wife and daughter had arrived. They ran towards Charlie as soon as they got off the plane, embracing each other happily. [Fang Chongyu] quietly walked to the side and unloaded the equipment. [Fang Chongyu] didn't hear.
1:3:40|1:3:58|The little bug stopped in its tracks, turned around and saw [Zhou Yiqing]. It rushed over and hugged her tightly. The two walked side by side along the edge of the salt lake.
1:4:6|1:4:8|[Zhou Yiqing] suddenly found herself facing the small bug walking backwards.
1:4:29|1:4:31|Turning around, [Fang Chongyu] walked in front of the little bug.
1:4:51|1:4:58|The little bug grabbed [Zhou Yiqing]'s hand, gazing at her, and said earnestly.
1:5:17|1:5:28|Li Qing smiled as she took off her backpack and tied up her hair. The two stood on the same starting line, just like in the competition on the school sports field years ago.
1:5:34|1:6:0|[Zhou Yiqing] stopped after running a few steps, clutching her chest and gasping for breath. Seeing that she had fallen behind, the little bug stopped and turned to shout. Yiqing smiled at him. As they parted ways, the bottle was covered with the reluctant farewells of friends and family.
1:6:2|1:6:27|The little bug reached out to shield the sunlight for Yiqing, helping her tuck her hair behind her ears and taking off his own hat to put on her head. Yiqing touched the bug's hair, brought her head close to his, leaned in, and solemnly kissed her forehead.
1:6:31|1:6:46|After speaking, mischievously put the hat back on Little Bug's head, the brim covering half of his face. Someone was urging Little Bug.
1:6:56|1:7:1|Previously, Fang Chongyu watched the little bug leave, took a few steps, then stopped.
1:7:7|1:7:30|He put down his backpack, tied up his hair, and ran towards the direction where the little bug left with all his strength. He opened his arms wide, ran until he was out of breath, covered his chest, and stopped with a smile.
1:7:41|1:8:8|In the church, [Zhou Yiqing] walks towards the groom in a wedding dress, they smile at each other as they slowly approach. Just as they are about to kiss, the small bug in the tent suddenly wakes up, realizing that the wedding was just a dream of the bug. The bug wakes up, breathing heavily, looks up at the night sky, the moon is high, round, and bright.
1:8:11|1:8:24|The marathon participated by Xiao Chong was reported by the TV station. At the 273-kilometer Grand Canyon Ultra Marathon held in Utah, USA, 150 top athletes from various countries gathered at the starting line. Before the race started, Fang Chongyu almost withdrew due to a foot injury.
1:8:29|1:8:31|The two of them are constantly pulling back and forth in the competition.
1:8:35|1:8:56|Dad, with an IV drip, was both shocked and delighted to see this report. Xiao Ke was cheering for Xiao Chong in front of the TV with his daughter. In the desert, Xiao Chong never relaxed for a moment. A female contestant behind the team surpassed Xiao Chong and Charlie. The two of them worked hard to surpass the female contestant again. The tug-of-war between Xiao Chong, Charlie, and their opponents continued.
1:8:56|1:9:5|Approaching the finish line, both Fang Chongyu and Zhou Yiqing were feeling a bit exhausted. A Xuan looked at Charlie's deteriorating condition and gritted his teeth to continue exerting force.
1:9:12|1:9:24|The little bug turned back and saw Charlie fall to the ground, stopping in his tracks. The female contestant following closely behind waved her arms and crossed the finish line first, eliciting cheers from the crowd.
1:9:29|1:9:34|Xiao Chong helped [Zhou Yiqing] up and ran forward together with him. Xiao Chong said to him.
1:9:40|1:9:51|Xiao Chong and [Zhou Yiqing] crossed the finish line with smiles on their faces, embracing each other tightly. In the alley, [A Xuan] caught a thief, while the TV in the grocery store was broadcasting the news.
1:9:58|1:10:23|The thief broke into the grocery store, [A Xuan] propped up the half-closed anti-theft door of the store and wrestled with the thief. The grocery store owner's wife persuaded [A Xuan] and then punched the thief on the ground. At this time, Wang Dalu's interview was playing on the TV.
1:10:52|1:10:55|[A Xuan] saw the news about the little bug on TV.
1:11:17|1:11:23|[A Xuan] focused on the news report. The thief took the opportunity to crawl away from the ground, but [A Xuan] turned around and caught him back.
1:11:43|1:11:52|A Xuan grabbed his hair in pain, squatted on the ground and cried loudly. On the TV screen, there was a scene of Xiaochong and Charlie joyfully embracing each other as they crossed the finish line.
1:12:9|1:12:22|The boss sent the boss lady to make tea, and she walked over to squat beside [A Xuan], patting his shoulder to comfort him. She understood that [A Xuan] was hating himself for not sticking to his dreams.
1:12:25|1:12:53|The coverage of the marathon continues, with Little Bug's father watching his son waving his arms on TV with tears of joy. The final score is out, and Little Bug is the world champion.
1:12:56|1:13:17|Dad raised his thumb to celebrate for his son across the screen, while the TV was still playing the record of Xiaochong's journey. Dad tremblingly used medical tape in private, removed the intravenous needle, rushed out of the house, and ran with all his might on the road.
1:13:18|1:13:38|The elderly man, whose illness no longer allowed him to run for too long, still exerted all his strength to swing his arms, as if he had found his youthful self in that moment. Gasping heavily, Dad jumped up before collapsing on the ground, raising his arms and shouting out loud.
1:13:47|1:14:3|After the match, Fang Chongyu rushed back immediately. He ran towards the church at the fastest speed. Inside the church, the priest was reading the marriage vows.
1:14:6|1:14:14|When he stood still, he realized that the bride was not the one he loved. Amid the puzzled looks of the guests, [Zhou Yiqing] apologized and prepared to leave.
1:14:19|1:14:25|The orphanage director sitting in the front row called out to Little Bug, ran over and said a few words to him, and Little Bug nodded.
1:14:30|1:14:40|[Zhou Yiqing] lies on the hospital bed. Xiao Chong sits by the bed, holding [Zhou Yiqing]'s hand and gazing at her.
1:14:52|1:14:57|[Zhou Yiqing] hesitated timidly, her voice faltering as she leaned in to listen to the small bug.
1:15:15|1:15:22|Closing his eyes in pain before, when he opened them, they were filled with tears.
1:15:34|1:16:1|[Zhou Yiqing] pulled the small bug closer, laboriously lifted her head, and pressed her forehead against the bug's. After speaking, [Zhou Yiqing] closed her eyes, and her head and hands relaxed at the same time, falling onto the sickbed. In the small clinic room, [A Xuan] knelt in front of the eccentric doctor.
1:16:3|1:16:7|[A Xuan] did not agree, the strange doctor shook his head and ordered the bodyguard.
1:16:30|1:16:56|[A Xuan] and the bodyguard started fighting, [A Xuan] took the knife from the bodyguard's hand, rushed forward and held the knife against the neck of the strange doctor, roaring. Touching [A Xuan]'s weak spot, he withdrew the knife and knelt back down on the ground.
1:17:24|1:17:32|In the hospital, [Xiao Chong] touched the bed he used to lie on before. Now, it was empty inside, devoid of any warmth.
1:17:41|1:17:50|[Zhou Yiqing]'s fiancé walked in and handed her a shoebox.
1:18:0|1:18:14|He looked at them running into a dead end together, the little bug sadly staring at the red sneakers that had once been worn for him.
1:18:26|1:18:32|The little bug tightly grasped the red shoelaces on the pair of shoes, lowered its head, and burst into tears.
1:18:41|1:19:6|In a dilapidated bathroom, a sinister atmosphere pervades, with the dim yellow light on the ceiling swaying precariously. [A Xuan] wakes up from a daze, finding himself shirtless and lying in a bathtub filled with blood-stained water. He grits his teeth in pain as he kneels up, revealing a long scar on his waist.
1:19:11|1:19:38|He realized that the quack doctor had taken his kidney while he was unconscious. [A Xuan] roared and collapsed weakly. Thinking of Xiao Ke and his daughter, he gritted his teeth in pain, grabbed the side of the bathtub with all his strength, flipped out of the bathtub, picked up the clothes draped over the sink, pushed open the door, and ran out.
1:19:38|1:19:40|At home, Fang Chongyu is coaxing his daughter to sleep.
1:19:51|1:19:56|[A Xuan] covered his wound, stumbled and ran wildly all the way, and finally reached the door of his home, where he forcefully knocked on the door.
1:20:6|1:20:32|No one opened the door for him, so [A Xuan] had to climb in through the window. He ran to the side of the baby crib and found his daughter was not inside, thinking that something bad had happened to her. He grabbed her clothes, held them tightly to his chest, and cried loudly. At that moment, Xiao Ke pushed the door open and [A Xuan] held him tightly.
1:20:32|1:20:35|Xiao Ke was shocked to find blood on [A Xuan]'s body.
1:20:51|1:21:5|It's late at night, Xiaochong is sitting in the taxi drinking beer. A Xuan walks over, leans against the car, and bends over to look at Xiaochong.
1:21:15|1:21:33|[A Xuan] stared at the small bug, which answered with a tone of sadness.
1:21:38|1:21:53|A Xuan climbed onto the hood of the car with an iron rod in hand. A Xuan forcefully smashed the windshield.
1:22:5|1:22:28|A Xuan finally kicked the shattered windshield, got out of the car and walked away. She didn't want to see Xiaochong become like her, losing dreams and living a miserable life. During the day, Xiaochong arrived at the orphanage and saw the director painting with the children.
1:22:44|1:22:46|[Xiaomi] hugged [Xiaochong].
1:22:50|1:23:6|[Little Bug] looked out and seemed to see the silhouette that used to run in the desert and the silhouette under the setting sun. One day, [Little Bug] and [A Xuan] sat on the high steps like they did when they were young, [A Xuan] hugged [Little Bug] and patted his head.
1:23:14|1:23:22|[Xiao Chong] removed [A Xuan]'s hand, smiled and responded, and [A Xuan] also smiled and playfully hit him with her hand. In the desert, [Xiao Chong] encountered a wounded wolf, which was lying on the ground in pain.
1:23:44|1:24:13|[Little Bug] slowly approached, determined there was no danger, and then took out the gauze from the bag to bandage the wolf. The wolf, in pain, suddenly bit [Little Bug]'s arm. It seemed like the wolf understood [Little Bug]'s words and loosened its grip. After bandaging the wound, it licked its own wound, remembering [Little Bug]'s appearance. Little Bug continued to run.
1:24:22|1:24:26|In the hospital, Coach Pan met the family of [A Xuan].
1:24:52|1:25:10|[A Xuan] immediately stopped smiling, looking nervously at Coach Pan. In the desert, the little bugs on the airport road took the opportunity while the camp owner went inside to grab something, and stuffed the food outside into their mouths.
1:25:14|1:25:20|The little bug hastily grabbed the food and ran away, while the owner aimed the gun at him and shot. The bug fell to the ground.
1:25:23|1:25:48|In the hospital, [Zhou Yiqing] lay on the hospital bed, watching the TV report and crying. Her fiancé, dressed in a white coat, hurried in, turned off the TV, and sat by her bedside.
1:25:55|1:26:20|Coach Pan brought [A Xuan] to visit. Coach Pan said to her former fiancé. Her former fiancé walked with [A Xuan] to the outside of the ward, and [A Xuan] grabbed his collar and questioned him. Her former fiancé showed his identification to [A Xuan].
1:27:6|1:27:25|Coach Pan and [A Xuan] took advantage of the medical staff's inattention and secretly pushed the already unconscious patient's bed away. [A Xuan] then knocked him to the ground.
1:27:30|1:27:57|A doctor came over and asked, [A Xuan] forced the doctor to reveal the location of the heart, drove with the engine to find the strange doctor. In the clinic, the female assistant handed the strange doctor a grape, but the strange doctor declined to eat it. While drinking water, suddenly [A Xuan] kicked open the door, pushed the bodyguard aside, threw the money to the side, and said to the strange doctor,
1:28:3|1:28:15|A Xuan pushed Yiqing in, she was going to use this money to have the strange doctor help Yiqing change her heart. The strange doctor put on surgical gown, connected the instruments, and prepared to start the surgery.
1:28:35|1:28:53|A Xuan geared up and went out to confront the police's armed search, buying time for the previous surgery. Looking at the dark corridor ahead, the flashlight from the police team was getting closer and closer. He pushed the abandoned hospital bed towards the opposite side with all his strength, hoping to delay the police team as long as possible.
1:28:55|1:29:12|In the desert, the wounded Fang Chongyu, bound and held at gunpoint, grits his teeth and stands up, using his feet to fight back. With his hands tied, the only way for Fang Chongyu to struggle is with his feet and arms. Exhausted from the long journey and the gunshot wound, Fang Chongyu is quickly knocked to the ground by the two burly men.
1:29:12|1:29:15|Outside the healing chamber, [A Xuan] is alone fighting against the police force.
1:29:15|1:29:29|In the dim and narrow corridor, [A Xuan] picked up a stick, knocked down the person in front of him, then grabbed the door frame with both hands and jumped up, using the height advantage to have the wolf that saved the small bug in the back desert suddenly rush over and bite off the rope tying the small bug's hands. It roared angrily at the opponent next to the small bug and fought side by side with the small bug.
1:29:55|1:30:22|The person with the gun fired several shots at the wolf. After the little bug temporarily subdued another person, he hurried over to knock the gun away and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. With the help of the wolf, the other person was driven away. Inside the clinic, [A Xuan] pushed hard against the door, but the police force was too strong. They broke in with guns and subdued [A Xuan].
1:30:27|1:30:36|Beside the desert camp, the little bug talks to the wolf.
1:30:42|1:30:48|The wolf ran far away, and the little bug watched as the wolf howled at the sky on a distant sand dune.
1:30:58|1:31:18|In the clinic, the eccentric doctor was also handcuffed, and the patient undergoing surgery stopped breathing. After running through the desert, there was an endless grassland in sight.
1:31:41|1:32:2|The orphanage has received more and more donations. Xiao Chongyu ran to the Tibetan area, next to the Five-Color Prayer Flags, with the image of Zhou Yiqing's smile in his mind. The statue of Princess Wencheng, who married into Tibet, stood nearby.
1:32:9|1:32:22|At night, as he crawled over the hill with all his might, what gave him strength in his weakest moment was the gentle smile of [Zhou Yiqing]. It seemed as if he was watching the little bug from above, waiting for him to catch up.
1:32:57|1:33:2|The eagle soars in the sky, while the insects run on the vast land of blooming rapeseed flowers.
1:33:6|1:33:19|Not running to win anyone, as he ran, the little bug seemed to see the figure that used to stroll in the rapeseed field.
1:33:23|1:33:43|The picturesque scenery of Yan Lake is marred by the changes in people's lives. A small insect runs by and sees the silhouette of an antlion by the lake, quietly watching the water. The insect stops in its tracks, stunned for a moment, then rushes into the water, but the antlion standing there has disappeared.
1:33:45|1:34:8|The little bug was forced to face reality, staring at the empty air, squatting down in pain, lowering its head, and gasping heavily. On the clear water surface, it seemed to see the reflection of [Zhou Yiqing] again. It slowly stood up and found [Zhou Yiqing] standing not far away, staring at each other.
1:34:11|1:34:28|[Zhou Yiqing] smiled gently, walked towards him step by step, reached out to touch his cheek, and planted a kiss on his forehead. Their foreheads leaned against each other, just like in the old days.
1:34:35|1:34:54|Perhaps for the little bug, running really can take him through time and see the smile of his loved one again. In his memory, [Zhou Yiqing] joyfully runs in the desert, smiling and waving at him, signaling him to catch up quickly.
1:34:54|1:35:1|When Xiaochong fell, [Zhou Yiqing] was always just a step away, bending down to reach out a hand to him.
1:35:12|1:35:30|Under the setting sun, a small insect once again climbs up the sand dune, the road stretching endlessly ahead, leading towards dreams. As night falls, someone turns into a star guarding its journey, amidst the vast galaxy, filled with love and dreams, wishing it eternal.
1:35:36|1:35:49|Our movie ends here, thank you for listening. The audio commentary of this film was produced by the Communication University of China. Don't rush to leave, there is a post-credits scene.
1:38:2|1:38:5|In the year , the 12th personal album "Twelve Constellations" of [Fang Chongyu] was officially released.
