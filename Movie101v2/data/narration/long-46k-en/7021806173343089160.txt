0:2:46|0:3:6|A gunshot rang out, and [Ah Yan] fell to the ground with blood on her head. The sudden rain seemed to be crying out for justice. Boss Ding, with a cigarette in his hand, had an extremely cold expression. The other workers kept their heads down, silent, no one stepped forward to speak for [Ah Yan]. The rain on the construction site grew heavier.
0:3:6|0:3:25|The body of [Ah Yan] was thrown onto the truck, rain mercilessly beating down on her body. Not long ago, she was still a lively life, laughing and playing with her colleagues. Now she carries endless grievances, lying still. The truck carrying [Ah Yan]'s body slowly drove out of the factory.
0:3:25|0:3:33|Mysteriously, a bullet appeared in her mouth at some point. At the other end, in the prison's water room,
0:3:33|0:3:57|A tightly knotted hemp rope hung from the ceiling beam, while the hourglass started counting down. [Old Lu] stood on a chair under the rope, which was securely tied. He looped the rope around his neck and then kicked the chair away. The rope instantly tightened around his neck, leaving him hanging in midair, unable to breathe.
0:3:57|0:4:8|He struggled to reach for nearby support by straightening his legs, but ended up kicking the chair even further away. Outside the door, [Qitiao], who was on standby, was completely unaware of the unusual situation inside the room.
0:4:8|0:4:17|He turned to look at the hourglass and realized something was wrong - it was stuck. He rushed into the water room, but Old Lu was nowhere to be seen.
0:5:18|0:5:34|In the prison building, [Old Lu] sat in the warden's office helping to organize documents. [Boss Ding] took the files he had processed and was about to leave. At that moment, the official warden arrived.
0:6:20|0:6:36|Old Lu's subordinates emptied a sack full of appeal letters, and countless letters piled up on the ground into a small hill. Old Lu bent down and picked up one of them.
0:6:44|0:7:4|[Old Lu] understood the mission clearly. He saluted [Guo Zhui] solemnly and accepted the appointment from his superior. On the other side of the hunting ground, Director Jin of the police station led several factory bosses for the hunt.
0:7:14|0:7:31|His prey was obviously not the birds in the cage, but the money hidden in the secret compartment of the cage. [Boss Ding] and a few others understood the rules, only the newly arrived Boss Huang was unprepared. His subordinates went to complain. Boss Huang smiled and politely declined.
0:7:34|0:7:48|Director Jin took the gun from his subordinate and smiled politely at Boss Huang. Then, he raised his hand and fired a shot into the sky. At the same time, a gunshot was heard from the distant forest, leaving everyone puzzled about what had happened.
0:7:48|0:7:55|Director Jin led the way, and they ran into the woods, only to see a group of plainclothes police officers surrounding a man who had been shot and fallen to the ground.
0:8:5|0:8:25|Boss Huang recognized his subordinate, but dared not make a sound. [Director Jin] naturally would not shield his men. His confidant [Nan Cheng] immediately understood, stepped forward on his behalf, picked up a stone, and threw it to the policeman who fired the shot, letting him apologize on his own.
0:9:3|0:9:10|Boss Ding casually patted Director Jin on the shoulder and walked away with a smile.
0:9:29|0:9:51|Night has fallen, and the Flower Street is bustling with people. In a corner, a person is gnawing on a piece of rotten steamed bun, completely ignoring the fact that the bun is crawling with worms. This person is [Guo Zhui]. He is fully focused on observing every move on Flower Street.
0:9:58|0:10:16|In Flower Street, hanging lanterns means receiving guests. [Guo Zhui]'s good friend [Xiao Wu] also followed along, standing next to the sweet potato stall, quietly observing. Compared to [Guo Zhui]'s composure, he seemed somewhat naive. At this moment, the light in a room suddenly went out.
0:10:17|0:10:29|In the house, Yao Jie's scream could be heard, [Guo Zhui] immediately looked over and noticed that there were no lanterns hanging outside that room. Sensing something was wrong, he quickly dashed over to chase. The others followed him, starting the pursuit.
0:10:30|0:10:47|He rushed to the scene and kicked open the door of the room, but there was no movement inside. Then he saw the victim Yao Jie, who was only wearing tight underwear, tied up and hanging in mid-air. [Guo Zhui] rescued Yao Jie. At the same time, [Xiao Wu] also arrived.
0:10:47|0:11:3|The windows were wide open, letting the wind blow in and causing the curtains to flutter. [Guo Zhui] noticed this detail and ran to the window, where he saw figures rushing frantically on the street. With a leap, he jumped out the window and chased after the criminal.
0:11:3|0:11:21|Without a moment's pause, unfortunately he was still one step too late. The person had already disappeared without a trace, and [Guo Zhui] searched all around, finding nothing unusual on the street. He turned to pick up his fallen hat, and then noticed a row of footprints next to it. He stared at the footprints for a long time.
0:11:21|0:11:38|This is left by the murderer when he climbed out the window. [Guo Zhui] pondered and followed the footprints out of the Flower Street, arriving at another even busier street. [Xiao Wu] silently trailed behind him, not daring to disturb his thoughts, with a constant flow of traffic on the street.
0:11:38|0:11:57|There is no trace of suspicious individuals. With no leads at the moment, continuing the chase would be futile. [Guo Zhui] has to find another way, resorting to extreme measures. He instructs [Xiao Wu] to stop all the cars on the street, while he himself stands in the middle of the road, blocking the vehicles and honking incessantly, causing the drivers to curse loudly.
0:12:1|0:12:16|[Guo Zhui] looked around and noticed that only one person, ignoring the hustle and bustle, sneaked into a restaurant. [Guo Zhui] immediately followed. In the upscale restaurant, there was singing and dancing.
0:12:48|0:13:7|[Guo Zhui] confidently locked onto the suspect. The piano music continued playing, but the pianist seemed distracted. As [Guo Zhui] approached, the pianist suddenly held a hostage at gunpoint, revealing a menacing expression. However, [Guo Zhui] smiled and without warning, he drew his gun and shot with incredible speed and accuracy, causing the other person to fall to the ground.
0:13:8|0:13:15|On the other end, [Old Lu] is narrating a bizarre case on the train.
0:13:40|0:13:53|Wu Zhongguo plans to use the mechanism of the clock to kill his wife. When the time comes, a dagger will spring out from the western clock and stab his wife, making it look like a suicide to outsiders.
0:14:7|0:14:24|There are loopholes in Wu Zhongguo's plan. The blood spatter from suicide and homicide are completely different, and missing parts of the clock mechanism will also be discovered by someone.
0:15:1|0:15:22|Old Lu was lost in memories. Before setting off, he had met Wu Zhongguo's wife, Fu Yuan. She was a very beautiful woman, clean like snow, and it was hard to imagine she was a murderer. Old Lu didn't approach her, but stood at a distance watching her. Fu Yuan seemed relaxed, while Old Lu appeared somewhat awkward.
0:15:22|0:15:29|He sat down next to Fu Yuan, creating some distance between them, and [Old Lu] took out his notebook.
0:15:30|0:15:45|Fu Yuan naturally took the notes from his hand and started reading them absentmindedly. [Old Lu] looked at her, not understanding her intentions, only knowing that this woman still held many secrets. The notes were densely filled with [Old Lu]'s insights on solving cases.
0:15:55|0:16:6|She looked at [Old Lu] and asked earnestly. [Old Lu] didn't answer, just smiled politely.
0:16:7|0:16:14|Fu Yuan leaned forward, getting closer. Her eyes stared straight at [Old Lu], whispering the secret to him quietly.
0:16:15|0:16:25|[Old Lu] lowered his head and took back his notebook.
0:17:25|0:17:43|[Old Lu] was stunned, Fu Yuan approached, bringing them closer together. [Old Lu] avoided her gaze, awkwardly replied. His eyes were sincere, and Fu Yuan couldn't help but smile, it was indeed the most heartwarming words.
0:17:44|0:18:0|Both of them laughed spontaneously, as if reaching a certain tacit understanding. They were no longer in a questioning and being questioned relationship. [Old Lu] noticed this change, withdrew the smile on his face, chose to stick to his own duties, broke the ambiguous atmosphere at the moment, and continued to ask questions.
0:18:3|0:18:18|Fu Yuan was a very clever woman. She understood that even if she continued, she wouldn't get the answers she wanted. She stood up, took off the scarf around her neck, as a parting gift, and put it on [Old Lu]. She leaned close to [Old Lu]'s ear and bid him farewell.
0:18:27|0:18:35|She turned around and left gently, without looking back, but her steps were slow, perhaps she was lingering on something in her heart.
0:18:54|0:19:13|Fu Yuan left and returned to her cell, with [Old Lu] watching her leave. [Old Lu]'s memories came to an end. At this moment, he arrived alone in Tiancheng County, resting his hand on the scarf, lost in thought. The carriage carried him through the streets.
0:19:13|0:19:29|The streets were bustling with people and vehicles coming and going. In the vast city, [Old Lu] seemed somewhat small as he looked around at the familiar surroundings, with a car parked in front of the police station. [Xiao Wu] was already waiting at the entrance to greet [Old Lu].
0:19:37|0:19:45|[Xiao Wu] took [Old Lu]'s luggage and led him into the police station. The police station was decorated very grandly, and [Old Lu] looked around, searching for his seat.
0:19:47|0:19:58|However, [Xiao Wu] led him to a desolate basement, which was a warehouse for storing files and documents. The walls were cracked, the place was in disrepair, and the roof was leaking. [Xiao Wu] explained to [Old Lu],
0:20:7|0:20:22|[Old Lu] smiled optimistically. [Xiao Wu] put down the luggage. Only [Old Lu] remained in the room, he blew away the dust in the room and happily accepted the working environment.
0:21:31|0:21:46|He washed his hands, walked out of the dormitory, and suddenly a gunshot rang out, alarming the entire factory. The workers all stopped what they were doing, and the female workers witnessed the scene, screaming in shock. Inside the police station.
0:21:51|0:22:5|A butler pays bail for a prisoner. The released prisoner turns out to be the one [Guo Zhui] was chasing in Huajie. He takes the butler's gun, casually throws the bandages wrapped around him on the police table, showing extreme arrogance and no sign of remorse.
0:22:6|0:22:33|[Guo Zhui] pushed the door open and restrained the criminal with one hand. The criminal was forced to step back repeatedly, and in a panic, he pulled out a gun. However, [Guo Zhui] had already placed his hand on the gun holster ahead of him, having experienced firsthand the incredible marksmanship of [Guo Zhui], they stood in a stalemate, afraid to shoot. At this moment, [Director Jin] pushed the door open.
0:22:36|0:22:42|Director Jin took the gun from his subordinate, loaded it, and walked quickly over to hand it to Guo Zhui.
0:22:48|0:23:8|[Guo Zhui] had nothing to say, looking at [Director Jin] with a sense of unwillingness in his heart. His subordinates quickly escorted the prisoner away at the director's signal. The farce came to an end, a conclusion that everyone was already accustomed to. [Old Lu] walked over.
0:23:10|0:23:19|After listening to the report from his subordinate, Director Jin's face changed.
0:23:23|0:23:43|[Guo Zhui] took the lead, without saying a word, turned around and walked away. [Xiao Wu] immediately followed, and [Old Lu] nodded goodbye and followed [Guo Zhui]. At the entrance of the police station, [Guo Zhui] and [Xiao Wu] got into the car, with [Old Lu] quickly following suit and getting into the car. [Xiao Wu] was puzzled. [Old Lu] smiled friendly towards the two of them.
0:23:43|0:23:53|Guo Zhui nodded, allowing Old Lu to accompany him. The military factory was filled with thick black smoke, and after several consecutive murders, the entire factory became oppressive and eerie.
0:23:54|0:24:5|[Guo Zhui], [Xiao Yunque], and [Xiao Wu] walked into the dormitory where the incident occurred, only to find Chen Qi's body lying on the ground with a fatal wound to the forehead, blood spattered all over the floor. Next to the body, there was a handgun.
0:24:10|0:24:24|[Old Lu] took out a notebook from his pocket, bent down to inspect the body, and carefully made notes. [Guo Zhui] picked up the gun from the ground, opened the magazine to check, and found only one blank round inside. He put the gun back in its original place.
0:24:25|0:24:42|Continuing to examine the fatal wound on the victim's forehead, [Old Lu] also approached. He was forced back by a glance from [Guo Zhui]. [Old Lu] obediently stepped back. [Guo Zhui] moved the body's head, revealing a hole in the back of the head with brain matter leaking out.
0:24:42|0:24:56|Blood was sticking to the hair. [Guo Zhui] lifted his head, as if noticing something. On the wall behind the body, there was a bullet hole, and he walked over to inspect it. The hole still had traces of blood, as if it belonged to Chen Qi.
0:26:7|0:26:13|To protect the scene, [Old Lu] caught the cigarette ash dropped by [Boss Ding]. Therefore, the murderer is likely one of the workers here.
0:26:16|0:26:44|Underling Wang Haiba aimed his gun at [Old Lu], but [Guo Zhui] took aim at [Boss Ding] first. Neither showed any sign of backing down, with both their lives hanging by a thread. [Boss Ding] looked warily at [Guo Zhui], took off his hat and placed it on Wang Hai's gun, signaling an end to the confrontation. He then sneered at [Old Lu], spat on the ground disdainfully, and gazed at [Guo Zhui] with a mocking smile.
0:26:54|0:27:4|Boss Ding picked up his cigar and turned to leave. Boss Ding stopped in his tracks.
0:27:9|0:27:29|Guo Zhui appreciated Old Lu's reasoning just now and welcomed him with a smile. Xiao Wu also warmly shook hands with Old Lu. Inside the university laboratory.
0:27:48|0:27:56|Li Jia took the hair from [Old Lu]'s hand and brought it to the experiment table. She put the hair and the ignited cotton together into a glass bottle.
0:27:57|0:28:13|[Old Lu] followed [Guo Zhui] around the laboratory, waiting for the results. Li Jiajing quietly observed the changes in the glass bottle. The cotton in the bottle burned vigorously, with sparks flickering. The hair ignited instantly, emitting a large amount of smoke.
0:29:1|0:29:10|Old Lu is attacked from behind. Hidden behind the curtain is actually an ostrich.
0:29:21|0:29:24|Whenever Wang Hai is mentioned, [Guo Zhui] would fall into contemplation.
0:29:24|0:29:44|At night, three people sneaked into Wang Hai's dormitory and, as expected, found a wooden box filled with dummy bullets. [Old Lu] walked to the bedside, checked the bed, and found the sheets neatly folded, different from usual. [Old Lu] gently opened the back corner, [Guo Zhui] also looked over, but unfortunately did not find anything suspicious.
0:29:44|0:29:53|Old Lu carefully restored the bedding, while Guo Zhui analyzed the situation in front of him with a blank mind.
0:29:53|0:30:12|At this moment, the door of the dormitory was pushed open, and the owner of the room, Wang Hai, walked in. He quietly looked at the three unexpected guests in the room, Xiao Wu nervously put away the key in his hand, while Old Lu remained calm.
0:30:25|0:30:32|Guo Zhui looked at Wang Hai, smiling meaningfully. Old Lu seemed to have a deep connection with the two, at the night market.
0:30:59|0:31:14|[Xiao Wu] took out a red envelope from his pocket and pulled out the silver dollar inside. [Guo Zhui] smiled and also took out an identical red envelope from his pocket.
0:31:19|0:31:30|[Xiao Wu] handed the red envelope to [Guo Zhui] without hesitation, then continued to eat noodles with his head down. Xiao Wu was already thinking about taking it back.
0:31:43|0:31:56|Xiao Wu looked at the bottle of wine cluelessly, he probably couldn't handle this dinner tonight. Seeing his bewildered expression, Old Lu and Guo Zhui both chuckled. On Flower Street.
0:32:19|0:32:39|[Xiao Yunque] is a famous fortune teller on Flower Street, with trendy short hair, wearing sunglasses, and seemingly blind. [Old Lu] writes down a name and hands it to [Xiao Yunque], who takes the note to the birdcage and shows it to the parrot inside. Then she opens the cage.
0:32:39|0:32:46|The parrot flew to the signboard, picked up a stack of divination slips, and [Xiao Yunque] fumbled to interpret them.
0:33:35|0:33:44|Xiao Yunque's eyes regained their sparkle.
0:34:2|0:34:12|[Guo Zhui] took out his and Xiao Wu's red envelopes. The smile faded from [Xiao Yunque]'s face, clearly she was in the know.
0:34:38|0:34:54|Boss Ding opened the magazine, emptied the bullets. Leaving only one, in front of the workers, he put the bullet back into the magazine, spun the chamber. No one knew if the final shot would be fatal.
0:35:5|0:35:23|Boss Ding pressed the gun against his own head, luckily, it was an empty bullet. Boss Ding opened the magazine again, showing the bullets inside to prove that he wasn't playing tricks. A worker lowered his head guiltily, as if he knew something.
0:35:32|0:35:51|Ayin was speechless, and could only follow the rules of [Boss Ding]. [Boss Ding] handed the gun to [Chen Qi]. [Chen Qi] took it and walked slowly towards Ayin, throwing the gun in front of her. Ayin trembled as she picked up the gun, imitating [Boss Ding], pointing the gun at herself. The workers watched her with sorrow.
0:35:51|0:35:54|But he was not able to speak a fair word for her.
0:36:12|0:36:29|Ah Yan fell to the ground after being shot. [Chen Qi] sneakily glanced at [Boss Ding], as if he had known the outcome all along. [Boss Ding] walked up to Ah Yan's body, took out a bullet from her pocket, and held it up as evidence.
0:36:48|0:36:54|Boss Ding pried open Ah Yan's mouth and stuffed the bullet that had been painstakingly retrieved back into her mouth.
0:36:55|0:37:7|Lightning flashed and thunder roared in the sky, but there was silence in the factory, with everyone feeling threatened.
0:37:17|0:37:24|Old Lu questioned Guo Zhui, who lowered his eyes and began to ponder.
0:38:14|0:38:36|Xiao Wu walked to Xiao Yunque's position that night. Xiao Wu imitated Xiao Yunque and knelt down. Guo Zhui imitated Boss Ding and emptied all the bullets on the ground. Boss Ding stood on the stairs overlooking everyone. Guo Zhui handed the gun to Xiao Wu.
0:38:39|0:38:47|Boss Ding tapped the railing and walked down. Old Lu handed the gun to Xiao Wu as the worker instructed. Boss Ding applauded.
0:39:22|0:39:27|Old Lu handed the gun to Boss Ding without hesitation.
0:39:32|0:39:47|[Old Lu] smiled and holstered his gun, [Boss Ding] put down his cigar, clasped his hands together, and solemnly bowed in all directions. Sensing something amiss, [Xiao Wu] felt suspicious, but [Old Lu] just smiled and responded naturally.
0:40:4|0:40:11|Guo Zhui looked worriedly at Old Lu, and the three of them began their investigation.
0:40:34|0:40:50|The trio had just entered the tunnel when they heard a gunshot, and they hurried to the source of the sound. They pushed open an iron gate and went deeper into the tunnel. [Guo Zhui] and [Xiao Wu] held their guns cautiously, watching their surroundings.
0:40:51|0:40:58|At the end of the tunnel appeared a corpse, sitting stiffly on a chair. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be Director Jin who had passed away.
0:40:59|0:41:13|Director Jin was shot in the chest. Guo Zhui checked the dropped gun on the ground. There were only two bullets left in the magazine, one of which was a blank. Guo Zhui leaned in to smell the body.
0:41:17|0:41:23|[Xiao Wu] immediately ran over and closed the iron gate.
0:41:25|0:41:40|[Old Lu] stripped off [Xiao Wu]'s coat, threw it on the ground, then squatted down, struck a match, and set his coat on fire. Smoke immediately billowed out. [Xiao Wu] also squatted down, looking at the burning coat, unable to understand Old Lu's intentions.
0:41:40|0:41:55|Old Lu watched as the fire grew stronger and stronger, estimating in his heart that it was time. He slowly stood up. Xiao Wu, who was beside him, was even more confused, looking at Old Lu in puzzlement. Without saying a word, Old Lu used his foot to stamp out the fire.
0:41:55|0:42:14|The smoke in the tunnel became thicker and thicker, lingering around, not dispersing for a long time. [Guo Zhui] stood by the body, while [Xiao Wu] curiously looked at [Old Lu], waiting for him to reveal the mystery. [Old Lu] walked into the smoke, carefully observing it, determining the direction of the secret room's airflow, and came to his conclusion.
0:42:30|0:42:46|In the laboratory, [Li Jia] is dissecting the body of [Zhuo Ge]. She skillfully cuts open the skin of the body and digs layer by layer. There is a fracture on the rib cage of the body, but strangely, no bullets are found inside.
0:43:6|0:43:24|[Guo Zhui] moved the desk lamp over and leaned in to examine the body. Upon closer inspection, he discovered a clue - there were some fine threads in the mouth of the corpse. There were ligature marks on both of the corpse's wrists.
0:43:24|0:43:39|Old Lu and Xiao Yunque returned to the scene of the crime. Xiao Wu imitated the killer, while Old Lu imitated the murdered Zhuo Ge. His hands were tightly bound with hemp rope, rendering him immobile. His mouth was gagged with a cloth, unable to call for help. Old Lu imagined the scene of Zhuo Ge's murder.
0:43:39|0:43:47|Feeling the fear he had faced before, [Old Lu] looked towards the ventilation shaft in the tunnel.
0:43:51|0:44:14|Old Lu's mouth was sealed, he could only sway his head from side to side, expressing himself unclearly. Xiao Wu couldn't understand, Old Lu, feeling helpless, had to move a chair and jump to the vent with difficulty. Through the vent, Old Lu saw a person walking towards them, and Xiao Wu also leaned over to take a look.
0:44:27|0:44:39|Xiao Wu ran back to help Old Lu run together. The iron gate was pushed open, and Old Yang from the factory sneaked in without noticing Old Lu and Xiao Wu hiding in the dark.
0:44:42|0:44:49|[Laoyang] burned incense and turned to see [Old Lu] sitting in a chair.
0:45:6|0:45:24|[Xiao Wu] held a pistol in his left hand and a specially made three-pronged wrench in his right hand. He tried to use the wrench to remove the magazine, and it came off effortlessly. [Old Lu] took the magazine and started examining it, getting closer to the truth.
0:45:24|0:45:32|[Xiao Wu] brought [Old Lu] to [Guo Zhui]'s house. Just as they arrived at the door, they heard a gunshot.
0:45:34|0:45:43|[Old Lu] heard the sound and looked upstairs. [Xiao Wu] knocked on the door. [Guo Zhui] opened the door to welcome the guests, with the gun in his hand never leaving for a moment.
0:46:15|0:46:24|[Guo Zhui] made a lifelike fake ice bullet and shot it towards the dead pig hanging in the room, [Xiao Wu] ran to check.
0:46:26|0:46:51|[Guo Zhui] thought it was feasible, loaded the ice bullet into the crossbow and handed it to [Xiao Wu], letting [Xiao Wu] demonstrate. [Xiao Wu] took it, aimed and fired. The three walked in to inspect. [Guo Zhui] picked up a tool and compared the size of the bullet hole at the shooting site.
0:46:53|0:47:1|[Old Lu] was somewhat disappointed, pacing back and forth, deep in thought.
0:47:29|0:47:46|Guo Zhui was pondering Old Lu's words, while Xiao Wu was completely out of it.
0:47:52|0:48:4|The three of them returned to the laboratory. Li Jia bent down to dissect the body seriously. Xiao Wu curiously approached, stretched his neck, and became so absorbed in watching that he forgot himself, with their heads getting closer and closer.
0:49:32|0:49:41|In the underground warehouse of the police station, [Old Lu] looked at the blackboard in distress, which displayed a countdown.
0:50:17|0:50:39|[Xiao Wu] acted quickly, raised the envelope, [Old Lu] took the letter with confusion, [Xiao Wu] smoothly took the gun from [Old Lu]'s hand and slipped away. [Old Lu] opened the envelope.
0:51:43|0:52:5|On the other end of the letter, Fu Yuan sat on the snow, her fingertips gently sliding on the snow, writing a word carefully. She looked at the word on the ground and smiled happily. She finally shared this secret. Old Lu on the other end finished reading the letter, the sunlight shining on him as he processed his emotions.
0:52:5|0:52:14|Completely hidden. At night, with lightning and thunder, eerie sounds could be heard coming from the arsenal factory, gradually waking up the workers.
0:52:20|0:52:31|In an empty workshop, the machines were running, while the workers huddled together, looking around. Suddenly, two lines of blood appeared on the ground, indicating the appearance of ghost bullets.
0:52:39|0:52:47|The streets were filled with curses, catching the attention of the high-ranking officials from the Public Security Bureau. The workers collectively fled.
0:52:55|0:53:0|Director Jin accompanied the senior official to the police station, where the reporters had been waiting for a long time.
0:53:32|0:53:50|The workers refused to give up and started a rebellion. The foreman began to use force against the workers. When Director Jin arrived, the situation was already out of control. Boss Ding, with his hands on his waist, fired a few shots into the air. The crowd quieted down.
0:54:11|0:54:28|Director Jin quickly intervened. He glanced at Boss Ding and signaled to have a private chat with him. Boss Ding arrogantly pursed his lips, clearly not taking even the director seriously. The trio hid in the shadows, observing. Old Lu, bold and cautious, stealthily crept to a higher place to eavesdrop on the conversation between the two.
0:54:28|0:54:34|He always felt there was some kind of business relationship.
0:55:1|0:55:10|Boss Ding slapped Director Jin hard, but Director Jin remained calm, with a gun already pointed at Boss Ding's vital spot.
0:55:24|0:55:32|Secretly aimed at Director Jin's head. Boss Ding took out a thick account book from his pocket.
0:55:43|0:56:0|Old Lu accidentally flipped over while picking up his hat, grabbing the railing and almost unable to hold on, falling down below. At the critical moment, Guo Zhui rushed over and caught him. Old Lu used the momentum to climb back up the stairs, looking down again, the person was already gone.
0:56:2|0:56:4|The newspaper sensationalizes the murder case, causing panic throughout the city.
0:56:33|0:56:59|[Guo Zhui] lowered his head in silence, while [Old Lu] looked a bit weary. The trio arrived at the scene of the fire, gazing at the debris scattered all over the ground, it was not hard to imagine the raging flames at that time. The entire room was burnt to the ground, leaving only an empty frame.
0:56:59|0:57:15|They carried oil lamps and walked into the ruins, where the ground was covered with charred furniture. [Guo Zhui] noticed something and walked over, slowly crouching down to search in the thick ashes. At that moment, he discovered something shiny.
0:57:15|0:57:23|After clearing away the surface dust, it revealed a broken silver ring, and [Xiao Wu] holding a lamp discovered the key point.
0:58:1|0:58:10|There are dozens of graves here, each one hastily covered with no tombstones, Old Lu introduced them to him.
0:58:14|0:58:39|Three people dug up the bones of the Xiao Tao family. [Old Lu] unwrapped the body covered in grease, revealing Xiao Tao's tragic death. Unable to bear it, [Old Lu] turned away. After pausing for a moment, he continued to examine the body, opening [Xiao Yunque]'s mouth and then gently closing it after inspection. Though the corpses were silent, they spoke of the sin.
0:59:1|0:59:12|[Guo Zhui] watched this scene with a heavy heart. It was late at night, and the three of them had unearthed several more bodies.
0:59:13|0:59:39|[Xiao Wu] was exhausted and jumped out of the burial pit. [Old Lu] walked around and confirmed his conclusion. The three of them all thought of one person at the same time, the one who neatly folded the quilt for Wang Hai.
1:0:18|1:0:31|Xiao Yunque grabbed a handful of bird feed and threw it on the thug's face after he lit a candle.
1:0:32|1:0:47|She then opened the birdcage and released the parrot inside. The parrot flew straight towards the thug and pecked at the feed stuck on his face. Their leader's face was left with marks, and his eyes were also injured.
1:0:48|1:1:5|[Xiao Yunque] took the opportunity to escape, enraging the thugs completely, who chased after [Xiao Yunque]. [Guo Zhui] and [Old Lu] arrived at the scene, only to see the smashed stall. [Xiao Yunque] ran for her life, with the thugs closing in behind her, one of them raising a gun and aiming at [Xiao Yunque].
1:1:5|1:1:22|The bullet hit an innocent bystander, causing panic in the crowd. [Xiao Yunque] didn't dare to stop for a moment, as the bullets behind her could take her life at any time. As she was being chased, more thugs were being gathered by the ringleader. Meanwhile, [Old Lu] and [Guo Zhui] were following the commotion.
1:1:23|1:1:30|[Guo Zhui] rushed forward, immediately engaging in a scuffle with the opponent. He picked up one of them and slammed him against a street lamp, knocking him out cold.
1:1:31|1:1:46|The other thug took advantage of Old Lu's distraction, sneaked behind him, and locked his throat. Old Lu pushed back and crashed into the glass window. Seizing the opportunity, he turned the tables and flipped the thug to the ground. Meanwhile, Xiao Yunque ran out of breath.
1:1:46|1:1:55|She hid in a smokehouse. The gang leader was persistent and ordered his men to search separately. This group of men happened to run into [Old Lu].
1:1:56|1:2:16|[Old Lu] acted quickly, immediately stopping his steps, turning around and pushing a yellow cab to hide himself. However, the cab got stuck halfway. [Old Lu] slowly lifted the curtain of the cab and found out that the one blocking the cab was the hooligan's henchman. This was bad.
1:2:17|1:2:30|With immense strength, he overturned the van with just one hand, lifting [Old Lu] up and throwing him towards a nearby bollard. [Old Lu] reacted quickly, grabbing his henchman and pulling him, causing the henchman to collide and knock himself out on the bollard.
1:2:41|1:3:2|On the other side, the owner of the tavern mistook [Xiao Yunque] for a thief and dragged her out. This commotion attracted the leader of the hooligans, so [Xiao Yunque] had to continue to flee. She ran into an alley, where the hooligan leader blocked her way with a gun. [Guo Zhui] arrived and, seeing [Xiao Yunque] in the hooligan's hands, immediately opened fire.
1:3:4|1:3:28|The thug held [Xiao Yunque] tightly while shooting at the feet of [Guo Zhui]. The bullet landed near [Guo Zhui]'s feet, but he remained calm, aiming his gun at the target. Despite hesitating, he was afraid of injuring the hostage. [Guo Zhui] slowly released the safety catch.
1:3:28|1:3:34|The thug is hiding in the alley. It's too far away, he must concentrate, aim at the prey, and hit the bullseye.
1:3:45|1:4:1|[Guo Zhui] calmly took a shot and hit the thug right on target, the bullet piercing his forehead and ending his life abruptly. When [Old Lu] arrived, he witnessed firsthand [Guo Zhui]'s marksmanship. [Guo Zhui] rushed over, causing [Xiao Yunque] to be frightened and faint in his arms.
1:4:1|1:4:9|The next day, [Guo Zhui] settled [Xiao Yunque] at home and helped her take medicine. [Xiao Yunque] wrapped in a blanket, lazily leaned on the sofa.
1:4:10|1:4:18|She looked at [Guo Zhui] with her head tilted, unable to hide the joy on her face. [Guo Zhui] casually asked.
1:4:20|1:4:28|Xiao Yunque's gaze stayed fixed on Guo Zhui without a moment's pause.
1:4:56|1:5:23|[Xiao Yunque] focused on [Guo Zhui], understanding what he was considering. The tender look in [Xiao Yunque]'s eyes caught [Guo Zhui] off guard. He was surprised that this delicate girl in front of him had such a firm conviction in her feelings for him. Having been a soldier, he was used to a life of gunfire and battles.
1:5:23|1:5:39|Once his life was meant for the battlefield, now it is used to protect the justice of Tiancheng County. He must uphold the justice in his heart. He cannot put down the gun in his hand. A person who is always accompanied by a gun cannot hope to have a family. [Guo Zhui] gently lifts [Xiao Yunque]'s face.
1:5:39|1:5:55|Looking at her, wanting to make sure if she knew that the man in front of her couldn't give her anything. [Xiao Yunque] smiled, her face full of happiness. Clearly, she was braver than [Guo Zhui]. [Guo Zhui] conceded, warmth gradually appearing in his eyes.
1:5:56|1:6:11|He gently kissed her face, this kiss was [Guo Zhui]'s promise. From then on, he had an extra concern. They snuggled closely to each other, their ears rubbing against each other. The sunlight shone on [Xiao Yunque]'s skin, making her stand out.
1:6:11|1:6:29|More charming and lovely. [Guo Zhui] couldn't help but kiss her, the kiss spreading all the way, becoming more passionate. In the room, it gradually warmed up, clothes slipping to the ground, the two of them meeting each other sincerely. At this moment, their hearts were connected, complete, and they had each other.
1:6:29|1:6:44|In the police station basement, [Old Lu] raised the gun, pressed it to his ear, and listened carefully to the sound of flicking the safety catch. He seemed to be imitating someone else firing a gun. Then, he put down the gun and carefully studied its structure.
1:6:44|1:6:51|He opened the magazine, put in a bullet, spun the chamber, and [Old Lu] listened carefully, trying to guess the position of the bullet.
1:6:51|1:7:6|With only two days left until the bet with [Boss Ding], [Old Lu] decided to take a gamble. He took a deep breath, pointed the gun at himself, pressing it against his temple. He resisted, tilting his head to the side, and ultimately moved the gun away.
1:7:7|1:7:16|The gun went off, narrowly missing Old Lu. Xiao Wu heard the sound and ran over.
1:7:29|1:7:50|The night market was not yet open, but the small stall was crowded with people. Everyone was watching [Old Lu] trying to unravel the mystery of the ghost bullet. [Old Lu] loaded a bullet into the magazine, chambered the bullet, and pointed the gun at himself. This time he didn't hesitate, he pulled the trigger directly, but there was no gunshot. [Old Lu] breathed a sigh of relief.
1:7:50|1:8:3|He opened the magazine again and poured out the bullet in front of everyone. Then, he repeated the process and loaded the bullet back in. He handed the pistol to [Xiao Yunque], instructing it to pass it to [Guo Zhui].
1:8:3|1:8:10|[Xiao Yunque] hesitated for a moment, but still did as told. [Guo Zhui] took the gun and pointed it at himself, [Xiao Yunque] immediately grabbed him.
1:8:11|1:8:24|Guo Zhui smiled apologetically. Old Lu walked over and took the gun. He fired six shots.
1:8:30|1:8:39|[Old Lu] took out a complete magazine, with six bullets neatly arranged on top. Then, in front of everyone, he demonstrated how to load these six bullets.
1:8:46|1:8:49|Boss Ding skillfully replaced the magazine.
1:9:18|1:9:33|The curse of the ghost bullet is broken without being attacked, the murderer may still take action, and [Xiao Wu] remembered Lao Yang, the worker who worshipped Zuo Ge. It was under his guidance that they discovered the mystery of the magazine.
1:9:42|1:9:51|It's okay not to care, whether it's mysterious person or not, shot and killed Old Yang.
1:9:53|1:10:4|The trio arrived at the ammunition depot, where a mysterious person shot at them, forcing them to retreat. [Guo Zhui] missed the opportunity to shoot when he stumbled, but he got up and continued the pursuit. [Old Lu] discovered the body of Lao Yang.
1:10:5|1:10:13|The mysterious person ran outside, followed closely by [Guo Zhui], who was about to draw his gun but was preempted by the police. Li Jin, at some point, was lying in ambush there.
1:10:14|1:10:30|Shortly after, [Boss Ding] and [Director Jin] arrived with their respective subordinates, and [Guo Zhui] hurried forward to check. The mysterious figure lay on the ground, barely breathing.
1:10:31|1:10:39|Director Jin's confidant, Nancheng, rushed over and strangled the opponent. Boss Ding staggered in front of everyone.
1:11:6|1:11:12|Director Jin on the side took out a police baton and gave each of them a hit.
1:11:13|1:11:21|Everyone present was overwhelmed by his momentum. At this moment, [Xiao Wu] understood what it means to have the power to cover the sky with one hand.
1:11:23|1:11:39|The crowd dispersed, and [Nan Cheng] pointed at [Guo Zhui]. [Guo Zhui] noticed the mark on his ring finger, where a ring had been worn for a long time. The mystery was solved - the ring left in the fire scene belonged to him.
1:11:40|1:11:54|[Nan Cheng] drove away, but halfway through the journey, his car was hit by another car that suddenly swerved in front of him, causing [Nan Cheng] to pass out. The ones who hit him were the trio. They tied up [Nan Cheng], hanging him upside down from the ceiling beam.
1:12:10|1:12:19|[Xiao Wu] released the rope holding [Nan Cheng], and just as he was about to hit the ground, he grabbed the rope again, pulled him up, and continued to hoist him up.
1:12:34|1:12:50|Once again on the brink of death, this time his head was even closer to the ground, and he was so scared that he foamed at the mouth.
1:13:3|1:13:9|[Guo Zhui] insisted on his own opinion, even shot at [Xiao Wu], who fell down after being hit and released the rope.
1:13:52|1:13:58|[Old Lu] dragged him into the shadows. [Xiao Wu] opened his coat to reveal the bulletproof vest underneath.
1:14:1|1:14:17|Old Lu settled Xiao Wu and then went back to find Guo Zhui. Little did he know that assassins were already ambushed in the corridor. Old Lu was strangled by a cable around his neck and hoisted up. The assassins tied the cable to a wooden stake, leaving Old Lu to fend for himself.
1:14:19|1:14:34|The assassin hidden in the dark shot the vital point in Nancheng. Bullets were flying from all directions, more than one assassin. [Guo Zhui] quickly hid behind the wall, seeking cover. Hearing the gunshots, [Xiao Wu] couldn't sit still and drew his gun. Meanwhile, [Old Lu] struggled to survive.
1:14:34|1:14:50|He grabbed the cable, exerted all his strength, lifted himself up in the air, then, did a backflip with a hanging hook. The cable loosened, and [Old Lu] was finally saved. The assassins locked onto [Guo Zhui]'s position, they gathered together, concentrated their firepower and sprayed bullets towards the location where [Guo Zhui] was.
1:14:50|1:15:10|The enemy's firepower is too strong, and they also have the advantage in numbers. [Guo Zhui] hiding behind the wall is almost about to be shot through, with debris flying everywhere. He can only temporarily lie in wait for the opportunity to counterattack. The enemy is determined to win, firing the machine gun wildly. As the wall collapses, [Guo Zhui] has no choice but to crawl on the ground, tightly suppressed by the enemy.
1:15:10|1:15:25|Just then, [Xiao Wu] sneaked behind the assassins and shot one of them. The assassin turned around and started shooting at [Xiao Wu]. [Guo Zhui] seized the opportunity and immediately shot, successfully killing one of them. The assassins were thrown into chaos and forced to scatter.
1:15:25|1:15:43|At this moment, it's a race of speed, which happens to be [Guo Zhui]'s specialty. In the blink of an eye, he takes down another person, climbs the stairs, and seizes the high ground. On the other side, [Old Lu] also arrives and joins the battle. He hides in a corner, ambushing the assassin, then pounces on him when he least expects it.
1:15:43|1:15:58|Pressing down hard on the opponent, rolling down the slope, completely subduing them. [Guo Zhui] stood at a high point, observing the enemy's every move. The enemy was still searching everywhere for him, while he had already raised his gun and aimed at them. Another casualty.
1:15:58|1:16:6|The assassin group was in complete chaos this time, shooting wildly. [Old Lu] peeked out and spotted one of the assassins.
1:16:8|1:16:23|The opponent saw that he had a gun in his hand and immediately hid behind the wall. This movement attracted [Guo Zhui], who agilely maneuvered behind the killer and shot him in the head. Xiao Wu was also engaging with the enemy, diverting firepower for [Guo Zhui]. Seizing the opportunity, [Guo Zhui] pursued and charged towards the last assassin.
1:16:24|1:16:36|Both sides have run out of bullets, but [Guo Zhui] only loaded one more bullet. He approached the enemy, who hadn't reacted yet, and became a dead man under the gun. The trio regrouped.
1:16:38|1:16:56|Nancheng is dead, and now the clues are cut off again. The enemy is relentless, hiding in the dark and shooting wildly, reigniting the battle. Bullets sweep through the area where the three are located, [Guo Zhui] raises his gun to fight back, but the other side has already disappeared without a trace, leaving only messy footprints on the ground. [Old Lu] runs to find Xiao Wu, seeing him propping himself up and standing up.
1:16:56|1:17:2|The whole person looked dazed and frightened. Xiao Wu smiled and answered Old Lu.
1:17:4|1:17:23|Suddenly, blood spurted from his neck. [Old Lu] quickly covered his wound, Xiao Wu's strength drained from his body, and he slowly sat down on the ground. [Old Lu] looked at him with sorrow.
1:17:54|1:18:12|Xiao Wu left with a smile on his face, a satisfied smile. For him, the long-standing mystery that had troubled him was finally unraveled. The remaining mysteries, he believed, his partners would surely be able to solve.
1:18:12|1:18:29|The meaning of death is too heavy, he was still so young, with plenty of time to experience the beauty of the world, and a budding romance that ended abruptly with his departure. All of this is so unfair to him, yet he used his kindness.
1:18:29|1:18:47|Old Lu accepted death calmly. There was still blood on his hands from Xiao Wu. The blood was warm, but Xiao Wu's body had turned cold. He had always been a reserved person, rarely showing his emotions outwardly, but now, his face was filled with uncontrollable grief.
1:18:48|1:18:55|[Guo Zhui] stood still, motionless, his face filled with disbelief, unable to accept the fact that [Xiao Wu] had left.
1:19:0|1:19:5|Li Jin rushed in with his men and looked at the body on the ground.
1:19:12|1:19:24|He accused vehemently. [Guo Zhui] noticed something unusual on his shoes. The mud on his shoes was enough evidence to prove that he was the murderer of [Xiao Wu]. [Guo Zhui] raised his fist and swung it.
1:19:35|1:19:48|[Guo Zhui] shook off the people following him, filled with anger but nowhere to vent. [Xiao Wu] and Nancheng were buried together, in a decent cemetery, with the symbol of honor, the police cap, buried with them.
1:19:48|1:19:56|The police officers came to see them off. [Guo Zhui] and [Old Lu] stood at the front of the line, mourning for [Xiao Wu].
1:20:0|1:20:13|The skills on his face, Director Jin has always been impeccable. After the funeral, Guo Zhui and Old Lu left side by side.
1:21:23|1:21:39|They reexamined the three bodies. [Old Lu] held surgical forceps and carefully examined the broken ribs. There were some shattered ribs inside the deceased, lodged in the lungs. These broken bones were all small, only the size of a fingernail.
1:21:39|1:21:56|He cleaned it slowly with a magnifying glass. At this moment, he found a piece of bone with a special shape, peeled back a corner of the lung with surgical forceps, and picked up the bone hidden underneath. The surface of the bone was stained with dried blood, and [Old Lu] put it into a beaker and cleaned it thoroughly.
1:21:56|1:22:3|The peculiar fragment of bone has finally revealed its complete true appearance. Unlike other bone fragments, it has a smooth cut surface.
1:22:33|1:22:40|In Wang Hai's room, there is a complete set of equipment for making bullets, and there are also some pig leg bones that have been hollowed out on the table.
1:22:47|1:22:49|Director Jin and others waited in a car outside the factory.
1:22:50|1:23:9|They had predicted the location where the case would happen in advance. Inside the factory, [Boss Ding] sat on the sofa, leisurely smoking a cigar. Wang Hai stood beside him. [Boss Ding] got up and walked to the cabinet filled with Western liquor, tapping on the green wooden box on the shelf, which contained his collection of antique guns. He opened the lid,
1:23:9|1:23:23|Wang Hai quietly pulled out a gun behind him, and [Boss Ding], through the mirror, sensed the danger and immediately pulled out his antique gun.
1:23:32|1:23:49|Wang Hai fired his gun like lightning and killed [Boss Ding]. Upon hearing the gunshots, the police officers at the station immediately sprang into action. With the factory gate wide open, they entered unimpeded. Inside the room, Wang Hai tidied up without dealing with [Boss Ding]'s body, and calmly opened the window.
1:23:50|1:24:6|Later, he took out the coaster on the table and bit it. He leaned against the wall, gritted his teeth and shot his own arm, creating the scene of being injured by the killer. The police rushed in, and he pointed the gun at the window, signaling the killer to escape from there.
1:24:6|1:24:20|A group of plainclothes officers rushed into the house, quickly searched around, and then withdrew after confirming that Boss Ding was dead. Wang Hai sat on the side, quietly watching their performance. Director Jin's team gathered inside the factory, attracting all the workers to come out and watch.
1:24:20|1:24:30|Li Jin reported the inspection results to [Director Jin]. Wang Hai put away the gun and left the scene.
1:24:31|1:24:40|Old Lu and Guo Zhui arrived at the factory, blocking his way. Wang Hai saw the two of them and was somewhat surprised. Guo Zhui looked at him expressionlessly, and they stood facing each other like this.
1:24:40|1:24:47|[Wang Hai] knew that even former comrades like [Guo Zhui] would not hesitate to shoot for the sake of justice. He fired at the two of them.
1:24:48|1:25:8|[Guo Zhui] pushed [Old Lu] aside, but the bullet hit his left wrist. [Wang Hai] took the opportunity to escape. He ran wildly, shooting and killing the workers blocking his way when he felt anxious. [Guo Zhui] and [Old Lu] chased him all the way to the ammunition depot, they split up and entered the depot from two different entrances.
1:25:8|1:25:21|[Guo Zhui] was the first to corner Wang Hai, leaving both of them with no way out. They had to face each other head-on. Wang Hai had been hiding his true abilities, lurking by [Boss Ding]'s side. His shooting skills were almost on par with [Guo Zhui].
1:25:21|1:25:36|The atmosphere became tense. At this moment, [Old Lu] rushed in from another entrance. He ran too fast, couldn't stop his feet, and slid directly between these two people, almost forming a straight line with them. [Old Lu] standing in the middle undoubtedly became a live target.
1:25:36|1:25:46|He looked at [Guo Zhui] with trust in his eyes, fully aware of his own situation.
1:25:48|1:25:57|Old Lu decided to help Guo Zhui by diverting the opponent's attention. He reached into his pocket in a gesture of pulling out a gun, while at the same time, Guo Zhui and Wang Hai fired their guns simultaneously.
1:25:57|1:26:16|The bullets grazed past [Old Lu], with one hitting Wang Hai's head and the other hitting [Guo Zhui]'s shoulder, in a showdown between the fastest gunmen. They gambled with their names, and now the winner has been decided. The loser lost his life. Wang Hai fell to the ground with blood gushing from his head.
1:26:16|1:26:29|With his fall, the case of the ghost bullet was finally solved. When it came time to reward the merits, Director Jin led his superiors to the scene. He rushed to the body first, eager to claim credit.
1:26:54|1:27:8|Director Jin grabbed Old Lu by the collar with a strong grip, full of threatening intent. Old Lu showed no sign of backing down. Along this path, too many people have died unjustly, including his good brother, Xiao Wu. He will never let the mastermind behind the scenes escape justice.
1:27:9|1:27:30|He pulled out a blood-stained notebook from Wang Hai. Director Jin was speechless. Wasn't the book in Old Lu's hand Boss Ding's account book? Boss Ding had used it to blackmail himself before, he wouldn't be mistaken. There were too many confused accounts between him and Boss Ding over the years, a casual stroke could make him lose his official position.
1:27:30|1:27:42|With the superior present and solid evidence against him, he couldn't possibly deny it. [Director Jin] walked away with a stern face, his steps steady as if accepting the reality with each stride.
1:27:42|1:27:50|Li Jin lowered his hat as Director Jin exited, but Old Lu did not forget Xiao Wu's cause of death. It was Li Jin who made the move that day.
1:27:53|1:28:5|Li Jin was completely panicked, kept retreating, and fell into the cart filled with ammunition. The superior glanced at the little notebook in Old Lu's hand.
1:28:6|1:28:24|The cover, stained with blood, was almost identical to [Boss Ding]'s account book. The superior looked at [Old Lu] with appreciation. On the other side, [Director Jin] was still not giving up, he was holding several workers hostage. When [Guo Zhui] arrived, he saw him holding a hand grenade.
1:28:34|1:28:50|Director Jin circled behind Guo Zhui, pretending to pull the pin of the grenade. Guo Zhui immediately shot to stop him, but it was too late, the fuse had been pulled.
1:28:57|1:29:16|He saw [Old Lu] about to enter the door and hurriedly stopped him. The explosion began, with a huge fire rushing towards them, followed by a strong blast of hot wind. [Old Lu] was thrown out by the impact. The exit was blocked by the fire, and there was still a lot of gunpowder stored in the ammunition depot, which was ignited by the flying sparks.
1:29:16|1:29:29|The explosions were continuous, and the fire was approaching. [Guo Zhui]'s first reaction was to protect the female worker beside him. He picked up a shield and held it behind him to block the fire. The surrounding explosions became more and more severe, trapping them in the sea of fire.
1:29:29|1:29:43|The female worker was trembling with fear, unable to move. With no way out, they could only bravely charge through the fire. [Guo Zhui] tightly held the female worker, protecting her all the way and shielding her from the flames, showing great courage.
1:29:43|1:29:59|Even in such a dangerous moment, he never gave up on saving people. Perhaps for him, saving people is almost an instinct. On the other side, [Old Lu] regained consciousness. He climbed up shakily, with the raging fire burning, anxiously looking for [Guo Zhui].
1:29:59|1:30:15|At this moment, he saw two figures rushing out of the flames, but his joy only lasted for a second. The explosion was not over yet, and the wooden board on [Guo Zhui]'s back had already been blown to pieces, almost using his own flesh to resist the fire. Another batch of ammunition was detonated.
1:30:15|1:30:28|Jets of huge flames shot out, with a scorching heat wave sweeping in, unstoppable. The entire ammunition depot was in imminent danger, countless rocks falling down, and another explosion chasing towards the nearby exit.
1:30:29|1:30:42|[Guo Zhui] and the female worker were knocked down by the explosion. In the blink of an eye, he quickly picked up the female worker and pushed her forward, rushing to a safe place before the next explosion. [Old Lu] arrived and caught him at the exit.
1:30:42|1:30:49|The explosion erupted again, and the fierce flames burst out like a giant python, followed by a wave of heat that knocked [Guo Zhui] unconscious.
1:30:50|1:31:6|He lay unconscious on the ground, his life hanging by a thread. He spared no effort to save others, but now he had little strength left to save himself. The explosion continued, and the ammunition depot was completely reduced to ruins. It seemed that all the evil had come to an end in this raging fire.
1:31:7|1:31:14|[Guo Zhui] was seriously injured and fell into a coma, and was urgently taken to the hospital for treatment.
1:31:16|1:31:31|Accompanied by [Old Lu] and [Xiao Yunque], as well as high-ranking officials from the police department, [Guo Zhui] performed exceptionally well in this case, which was all seen by Director Jin. Everyone was waiting outside the emergency room, keeping vigil for [Guo Zhui]. [Xiao Yunque] was in a state of turmoil, hiding in a corner and crying.
1:31:31|1:31:39|She was completely devoted to [Guo Zhui], to her many things were not important, being able to be by his side was the most important.
1:31:40|1:31:56|[Old Lu] stood aside watching her, he could feel the genuine friendship between [Xiao Yunque] and [Guo Zhui]. He looked a bit weary and leaned against the wall slowly. His expression at the moment was very serious, as if he was worried about more than just his brother's safety.
1:31:56|1:32:12|The surgery was over, [Old Lu] walked up to [Xiao Yunque]. Overwhelmed with joy, [Xiao Yunque] nodded repeatedly, thanking the heavens for keeping [Guo Zhui] alive. [Guo Zhui] survived the ordeal, a grand appointment awaited him.
1:32:18|1:32:26|He put on Director Jin's uniform, and everyone cheered for him, except for Old Lu who was absent. He stayed in the office, reading Fu Yuan's reply.
1:32:55|1:32:59|[Old Lu] is lost in memories.
1:33:10|1:33:17|[Old Lu] waited for [Guo Zhui]'s reaction. He avoided [Old Lu]'s gaze and looked around absentmindedly.
1:33:21|1:33:39|Old Lu pondered for a long time, as if making a decision. He returned to Director Jin's room again, this time conducting a solo search for evidence, leaving no detail overlooked. In the drawer, he found some red envelopes. Old Lu remembered that these were the kickbacks within the police station, the "cut" mentioned by Guo Zhui.
1:33:39|1:33:54|At the inauguration ceremony on the other end, [Guo Zhui] stood on the stage with a confident smile, while [Xiao Yunque] also transformed into a glamorous outfit and happily watched [Guo Zhui] from below the stage. [Old Lu] then arrived at [Guo Zhui]'s residence and stood in front of the fireplace, inspecting it.
1:33:54|1:34:8|The charcoal inside is neatly stacked, the walls are clean without any traces of smoke, all signs suggest that this fireplace serves a purpose. [Old Lu] noticed that one tile showed signs of being pried open.
1:34:8|1:34:25|He lifted the tile and found a hidden compartment underneath. The missing account book of [Boss Ding] was hidden in this compartment. Then, [Old Lu] was drawn to the wall inside the house, covered with countless bullet holes, left by [Guo Zhui] during his research on ghost bullets.
1:34:25|1:34:42|[Old Lu] used tweezers to dig into the bullet hole. As he dug deeper, a bone bullet dropped out. Blowing away the dust on the bullet, the true form of the ghost bullet was revealed. He had to face a fact that [Guo Zhui] was involved in the whole case.
1:34:42|1:34:57|Guo Zhui has already entered Director Jin's office. His subordinate respectfully brings a letter, Guo Zhui takes the letter and finds that the sender is Old Lu. Only investigating a case could make him so serious.
1:35:18|1:35:34|Before parting, [Guo Zhui] kissed [Xiao Yunque], with tenderness in her eyes as she watched him leave. [Guo Zhui] passed through the tunnel and headed alone to the agreed location with [Old Lu]. The tunnel was damp, with water pooling on the ground, making the path ahead muddy and treacherous.
1:35:34|1:35:51|Not long after walking, a gunshot was heard from deep inside the tunnel. [Guo Zhui] reacted quickly and immediately drew his gun. Following the sound of the gunshot, he arrived at the end of the tunnel where a secret room was located. The situation was exactly the same as when the trio first encountered it - the gunshot came from the secret room, but the room was empty.
1:35:51|1:36:7|[Guo Zhui] knows it's [Old Lu]'s habit to faithfully recreate the scene of the original murder. He arrives at the location where the body was found, the chair that was originally placed at the scene still remains in its place. On the chair lies the ironclad evidence pointing to the killer.
1:36:7|1:36:23|Boss Ding's account book and bone bullet, Old Lu did crack the mystery of the secret room indeed, and only Guo Zhui knows where he is at this moment. He arrived at the room directly above the tunnel.
1:36:48|1:36:55|[Guo Zhui] was left with only one bullet. He decided to leave it to fate. [Old Lu] shook his head.
1:36:57|1:37:12|Guo Zhui still pressed the gun against his head. He didn't dodge, but pulled the trigger directly. The first shot was a blank. He placed the gun on the table and pushed it towards Old Lu.
1:37:21|1:37:37|[Guo Zhui] did not deny it, his reaction confirmed [Old Lu]'s guess. [Old Lu] still had some doubts to clarify, he picked up the gun on the table and pressed it against his own head. [Guo Zhui] could tell that [Old Lu] was a bit nervous.
1:37:37|1:37:51|He hoped that [Old Lu] would stop, but he didn't. [Old Lu] clumsily pulled the trigger, the second shot was still a blank, and both of them breathed a sigh of relief. [Old Lu] handed the gun to [Guo Zhui].
1:37:58|1:38:15|[Guo Zhui] was very frank, and now it was his turn to ask questions. He picked up the gun and pressed it against his head. This time he hesitated a bit, as no one could predict fate. Fortunately, the third shot was still a blank. The gun was pushed back in front of [Old Lu].
1:38:26|1:38:48|It's [Old Lu]'s turn to ask a question. He picked up the gun and decisively pulled the trigger. The fourth shot was also a blank. This life-and-death gamble will continue.
1:39:3|1:39:19|The gun is still in [Old Lu]'s hand, and this time he doesn't intend to hand it over. His actions surprise [Guo Zhui], who seems to sense the atmosphere of death. [Old Lu] raises the gun and points it at himself.
1:39:21|1:39:35|Calmly accepting the judgment of fate. No one can predict the position of the bullet in the roulette. [Guo Zhui] lowered his head, unable to face the outcome. In the end, [Old Lu] was left behind. The fifth [Old Lu] looked at [Guo Zhui] and asked the final question.
1:39:36|1:39:53|The secrets hidden in the heart are being gradually unearthed. [Old Lu] will never forget that in times of danger, [Guo Zhui] has saved him more than once.
1:40:15|1:40:31|[Old Lu] was furious. He never expected that [Guo Zhui] would use such a reason to justify himself. The justice he upheld was obtained at the cost of a few lives. [Guo Zhui] appeared somewhat inferior, and he did not try to defend himself anymore.
1:40:36|1:40:55|[Old Lu] raised the gun mercilessly, this was his answer. But his eyes betrayed him, they were bloodshot with tears in them. [Guo Zhui] saw the inner struggle in him, he placed his own gun on the table, reminding [Old Lu].
1:40:56|1:41:3|Firing a gun is easy, but killing a friend is hard. At this moment, both of them are facing such a choice.
1:41:4|1:41:18|They all knew very well that today, only one of them would walk out of the room. [Old Lu] did not put down his gun, and [Guo Zhui] understood that [Old Lu] had made his choice, he wanted to stick to his original intention. He turned and left.
1:41:18|1:41:23|He couldn't shoot [Old Lu], he had already betrayed his original intention and couldn't make another mistake.
1:41:24|1:41:38|[Old Lu] stood behind [Guo Zhui], slowly aiming the gun at him. He knew that if he pulled the trigger and killed [Guo Zhui] today, he would never be able to forgive himself. Before the gunshot rang out, [Guo Zhui] stopped with a smile on his face. He looked out the window,
1:41:38|1:41:45|He remembered the way [Xiao Yunque] leaned on him, she was still waiting for him.
1:41:51|1:42:16|Gunshots rang out, echoing throughout the room. [Old Lu] slowly lowered his gun, looking at [Guo Zhui] in disbelief. In the end, [Guo Zhui] made his decision as well. Known as the fastest gunman in Tiancheng County, he also fired before [Old Lu], ending his own life. Good and evil are just a thought away.
1:42:16|1:42:30|Rather than facing the fact that he had turned bad, he couldn't bear to live on. His body collapsed to the ground with a loud thud. Tiancheng County had lost another director in the blink of an eye. Soon, people would discover his body.
1:42:30|1:42:46|They saw the two wounds on his face, one left when he saved people in the explosion, the other fatal wound left when he, as a villain, repented. As the journey came to an end, [Old Lu] left Tiancheng County with his luggage.
1:42:46|1:43:0|The train was moving slowly, and at this moment, [Old Lu]'s mood was completely different from when he arrived. He opened the notebook he carried with him and saw the two lines he had written on it before: "There is no perfect crime, only good people gone bad."
1:43:1|1:43:19|Looking at these words, Old Lu felt a mix of emotions. Along this journey, he had witnessed too much. On the day of bidding farewell to Fu Yuan, she turned around and asked herself the question.
