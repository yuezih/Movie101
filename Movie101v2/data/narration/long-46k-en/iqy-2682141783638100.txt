0:1:51|0:2:14|On the Jinpu Railway's Linzhuo Branch Line, which was occupied by the Japanese, a train carrying looted coal was speeding along. Suddenly, several figures swiftly climbed onto the train. They were workers coming to reclaim the coal - [Peng Liang], [Lu Han], and [Xiao Po]. At that moment, the Japanese noticed them, and [Peng Liang] blew a whistle to sound the alarm.
0:2:14|0:2:18|[Lu Han] heard the alarm and immediately alerted [Wang Qiang]. [Wang Qiang] turned around in a hurry, only to see a Japanese soldier rushing towards him.
0:2:25|0:2:47|On the side, [Lu Han] lifted a piece of coal and knocked out the Japanese soldier. Another Japanese soldier blew the whistle, and the train braked urgently, quickly coming to a stop. The coal miners jumped off the train and ran into the wilderness. The Japanese soldiers chased after them, shooting as they ran. One coal miner was shot and fell to the ground, where he was captured by the Japanese.
0:2:53|0:3:17|[Xiao Po] desperately ran towards a dense jungle by the railway. After running into the jungle, he couldn't run anymore and kept panting heavily. The Japanese soldiers ran into the woods, using the tips of their guns to push aside the grass, searching around for a while.
0:3:28|0:3:53|A Japanese soldier signaled, and they left the jungle. Liu Hong and [Xiao Po] finally poked their heads out of the pit, confirming that the Japanese soldiers had gone far away. [Xiao Po] excitedly asked Liu Hong, who nodded. They came out of the pit and quietly walked towards the edge of the jungle.
0:3:56|0:4:21|Taking advantage of the night, they arrived at the town, where a group of Japanese cavalry passed by. Liu Hong and [Xiao Po] hid behind a mud wall, avoiding the patrol team. Then, they climbed over the wall and jumped into [Wang Qiang]'s yard. A Japanese train, emitting steam, passed by on the distant railway, and they hid under the yard wall.
0:4:21|0:4:25|After the train passed, [Lu Han] ran to the front of the house in the yard and knocked on the window.
0:4:33|0:4:37|The light in the room turned on, and the guerrilla fighter [Wang Qiang] opened the door.
0:4:42|0:4:50|They walked into the house together, with [Wang Qiang] calling out for Xiaopo. Xiaopo came out.
0:5:30|0:5:33|Wang Qing heard the movement outside the house, got up quickly, opened the door, and saw [Lu Han] and [Peng Liang].
0:6:2|0:6:13|[Liu Hong] put his arms around [Lu Han] and [Peng Liang]'s shoulders, and the three of them smiled at each other. [Lu Han] pulled out the Beretta pistol from [Liu Hong]'s waist, his expression filled with excitement.
0:6:31|0:6:36|[Wang Qiang] said, and then sat down at the square table with [Fang Lin Sao], [Lu Han], and [Peng Liang].
0:7:3|0:7:26|The scene shifts to the foreign goods yard at the town's train station, where workers are carrying heavy goods on their backs. The Japanese manager Yamaguchi, leaning on crutches, stands at the entrance of the foreign firm, urging the workers to work. After he finishes speaking, he runs into [Wang Qiang] who is leaving.
0:7:26|0:7:45|[Wang Qiang] urged the workers on, then walked over to a large cart carrying goods to help a worker lift the goods onto his shoulder. After that, he put on a shoulder cloth and lifted a long straw-wrapped item onto his shoulder, walking towards the freight car of the train.
0:7:45|0:7:57|[Wang Qiang] carried the goods to the front of the carriage and loaded them into the carriage. Then, he looked up and glanced into the carriage, only to see that it was filled with firearms and ammunition.
0:8:0|0:8:23|At this moment, the staff closed the car door and secured the latch, then walked up to [Wang Qiang]. [Wang Qiang] noticed that the car carrying ammunition was number 1263, which made him lost in thought. That night, Liu Hong led [Wang Qiang], Peng Liang, Xiao Po, [Lu Han], and others to the side of the railway.
0:8:23|0:8:28|The Japanese train approached, and Lu Han, hidden in the bushes beside the railway, closely watched the train carriages.
0:8:30|0:8:51|When the carriage No. 1263 carrying ammunition was approaching, [Lu Han] rushed out, leaped up, and climbed onto the train. She pulled out her gun, quietly looked into the carriage through the window of the door, when a Japanese officer walked towards the carriage door. [Lu Han] quickly moved her body.
0:8:53|0:9:9|The Japanese officer glanced outside the car door, then pulled down the curtains inside and left. [Liu Hong] tucked the gun into her waist and crossed over to car 1263 from the carriage, gripping the protrusion outside the car with force, her head covered in sweat.
0:9:17|0:9:36|Finally, he climbed to the outside of the door of carriage 1263, used pliers to break the iron wire wrapped around the door latch, opened the carriage door, and flipped into the carriage. [Lu Han] threw down bundles of guns and boxes of ammunition in the carriage.
0:9:36|0:9:42|At the railway silver line, [Wang Qiang], [Lu Han], [Peng Liang] and others quickly picked up the firearms and ammunition dropped by [Liu Hong].
0:9:47|0:10:1|They excitedly opened the ammunition box, took out the guns inside, and smiled at each other. The two who opened the ammunition box were very excited.
0:10:18|0:10:47|[Wang Qiang] took the confiscated pistol and walked to the other side while smoking, [Lu Han] followed. The armored train was moving on the railway, inside were the Japanese soldiers [Kobayashi] and [Gangcun]. [Kobayashi] and [Gangcun] sat down at the table together.
0:10:49|0:10:52|In the courtyard of the special operations team, several anti-Japanese activists were shot dead by the Japanese army.
0:11:16|0:11:38|[Jiangcun] saw this scene in the office of the special agent team, a smirk on his face. He turned around and walked up to the coal worker who had been recently caught for coal robbery, now covered in bruises from the Japanese soldiers. [Jiangcun] took out a box of cigarettes and placed it in front of him, but the coal worker turned his head away, refusing his cigarette.
0:11:38|0:11:42|[Jiang Cun] had to take out his own lighter, but the coal miners remained unmoved.
0:11:44|0:12:11|Lu Han was just whipped by the Miracle Breaker, and blood flowed from his cheeks and mouth. Suddenly, gunshots were heard from outside. In the early morning, a large number of Japanese soldiers arrived at the village and conducted patrols and searches near the foreign firms at the train station. The Japanese cavalry team charged down the street, causing the villagers to scatter and flee.
0:12:40|0:12:58|Lu Han paused in front of [Gangcun] and then bid farewell. The scene shifted to the market in Zaozhuang, where Lu Han led his troops to conduct a search. He slapped a roadside vendor, causing the fruits on the vendor's stall to fall to the ground and be trampled by the Japanese soldiers.
0:13:1|0:13:25|Hearing the firecrackers in the distance, [Lu Han] stopped in his tracks. Many people ran towards the sound of the firecrackers. It turned out to be a coal exploration operation by the Railway Guerrilla Team. Workers were loading coal into baskets, using the operation as a cover for their activities, and shouting loudly to each other.
0:13:25|0:13:30|They warmly welcomed the customers, enjoying a good reputation, when suddenly a guerrilla fighter rushed in.
0:13:33|0:13:49|The Japanese soldiers led by Lu Han stormed into the village aggressively. Wang Qiang approached the village while Liu Hong, dressed as a boss, stood with Lu Han in the courtyard.
0:13:57|0:14:17|Lu Han refused him, looked at Tan Zhan with a suspicious look, and then led the Japanese soldiers away with the wolf dog. Wang Qiang saw the Japanese soldiers leaving, and happily started playing the earth lute in his hands. At this moment, Peng Liang, the newly appointed political commissar of the railway guerrilla team, walked into Tan Zhan, and Liu Hong was surprised to see him.
0:14:26|0:14:34|Liu Hong led Li Zheng into the house as he spoke. Once inside, [Wang Qiang] turned to check the situation outside the door and followed them into the room. Liu Hong took out the secret order hidden in his hat.
0:14:57|0:15:15|This appointment appoints Liu Hong as the government captain of the Lu Han Military Region Railway Guerrilla Team, [Wang Qiang], and Li Zheng as the political commissar. It's already night time.
0:16:4|0:16:7|[Lu Han] stood up, wanting to toast him with a glass of wine.
0:16:22|0:16:24|[Lu Han] poured a glass of wine and drank it all in one gulp.
0:16:37|0:16:40|[Lu Han] kindly took out an apple flute for him.
0:16:51|0:16:57|[Lu Han] pulled out a gun. Li Zheng straightened the two chopsticks on the table.
0:17:41|0:17:47|Li Zheng gestured with his eyes to Liu Hong, who stood up. Everyone sat down eagerly, looking at him.
0:17:52|0:18:0|Liu Hong waved his sleeves angrily and sat down, everyone fell silent and lowered their heads back to their seats, the atmosphere became tense.
0:18:22|0:18:49|Peng Liang took a glance at everyone, slowly stood up and spoke. As Liu Hong raised her eyes and Li Zhengang was about to speak, the lookout suddenly entered the room. Everyone hurriedly stood up, Lu Han was about to rush out with a pistol, but Wang Qiang stopped him in time and took the gun from his hand.
0:18:51|0:19:17|Outside on the village road, a group of Japanese soldiers led by [Lu Han] came for inspection. In the secret battle, [Wang Qiang] hid the gun in the coal pile, covered it with a shovel, and then picked up a nearby lute to play. It turned out that Li Zheng was disguised as the steward, while others pretended to be workers receiving their wages. At that moment, the Japanese soldiers entered the courtyard.
0:19:33|0:19:47|The Japanese soldiers kicked open the door and barged in. Lu Han looked around the room arrogantly, gesturing for the soldiers to enter, and furrowed his brow as he checked each person for signs of being a good citizen.
0:19:49|0:20:5|The Japanese soldiers also joined him in the inspection. At this moment, the newly arrived wolfhound was vigorously searching the coal pile where [Xiao Po] hid the gun. Suddenly, the wolfhound encountered a shovel.
0:20:14|0:20:38|[Lu Han] was puzzled, and [Wang Qiang] quietly picked up the shovel. [Lu Han] walked to the coal pile, and everyone's heart skipped a beat. The wolf dog picked up the dirt pipa on the coal pile. [Lu Han] looked at it suspiciously, found nothing, threw the dirt pipa on the ground, and left angrily.
0:20:38|0:20:41|[Wang Qiang] pretended to respectfully escort them out of the courtyard.
0:20:46|0:20:57|After the Japanese soldiers left, Xiao Po picked up the pipa and found that the strings were broken. He cursed in anger. Li Zheng then continued with his previous thoughts.
0:21:15|0:21:20|Liu Hong thought carefully, furrowing his brow. In the evening, [Lu Han] returned to the command post. The spy took out a group photo, showing the guerrilla fighters on it.
0:21:50|0:22:14|In the deep night at the entrance of Zaozhuang Village, the motorcycle team from Gang Village came aggressively, their headlights cutting through the darkness. The Japanese troops surrounded [Lu Han] and the guerrilla fighters, aiming to capture them all. They rushed into [Lu Han]'s courtyard.
0:22:17|0:22:42|The charcoal stove burned brightly, illuminating the room. With no response, [Peng Liang] led the Japanese machine gunner to continuously shoot into the brightly lit house. The guerrilla members walked on the mountain road, as they had already left.
0:22:46|0:22:49|Li Zheng smiled and patted [Lu Han] on the shoulder.
0:23:31|0:23:42|In the distance, a train is speeding by. The camera then cuts to the underground party of the Miao Village, where the guerrilla fighters arrive at the home of [Fang Lin Sao].
0:24:2|0:24:21|They sat down at the table, [Lu Han] holding [Fang Lin Sao]'s daughter Feng'er walked in, saying she was going to fetch water, [Lu Han] sat with Feng'er by the door, teaching her to play the lute, while the others chatted at the table, I had this idea.
0:25:18|0:25:20|The crowd exchanged glances and felt it was feasible.
0:25:51|0:26:13|At night, at the entrance of Zaozhuang Railway Station, people were coming and going, passengers were queuing up with their luggage for ticket inspection. The guerrillas disguised as merchants and pretended to be passengers, boarding the train through the ticket gate. On the moving train, [Wang Qiang] walked into a compartment with a bottle of wine and a roasted chicken.
0:26:17|0:26:39|He walked up to a Japanese officer lying on a chair, took off his hat, and nodded politely. The Japanese officer glanced at him, and [Wang Qiang] sat down across from the officer, placing a bottle of liquor and roast chicken on the table. The officer leaned back, and [Wang Qiang] tried to offer him a cigarette, but was rejected by the officer.
0:26:56|0:27:11|[Wang Qiang] handed over the cigarette again, the Japanese officer took it. At the door of the carriage, [Lu Han] disguised himself and was ready to take action at any time. [Wang Qiang] secretly kicked [Lu Han], who then handed the cigarette to the Japanese officer. The Japanese officer hesitated for a moment, then accepted it and started to smoke heavily.
0:27:13|0:27:26|[Wang Qiang] poured him a drink and kicked it in front of him. Meanwhile, in another train compartment, a guerrilla fighter obsequiously offered liquor and buns to a Japanese soldier.
0:27:28|0:27:38|On the side, the passengers whispered as the train continued to speed through the night. Inside the carriage, guerrilla fighter [Xiao Po] played the lute, while the Japanese officer listened with interest.
0:27:46|0:28:6|Meanwhile, [Lu Han] and [Peng Liang] had already hidden on one side of the railway. After speaking, [Lu Han] swiftly crossed the icy ground under the railway and ran to the other side of the tracks. [Peng Liang] also dashed out of the bushes, lightly leaped, and climbed onto the front of the moving train.
0:28:8|0:28:29|He looked up at the connection between the carriages and saw on the other side of the train head, [Liu Hong] had also climbed up. [Liu Hong] pulled out a gun and shot the Japanese driver. The two climbed onto the carriage and rushed into the driver's cabin. [Wang Qiang] quickly took the seat, skillfully operating the train, and the train immediately accelerated forward.
0:28:36|0:28:57|Liu Hong nodded, and as the driver entered, he happily picked up a shovel and energetically shoveled coal into the train furnace, causing the train to speed up on the tracks. In another carriage, guerrilla fighters were playing tricks on the Japanese soldiers, playing the pipa, and pouring cup after cup of wine.
0:28:57|0:29:23|The Japanese officer greedily chewed the food handed to him by the guerrilla, completely letting his guard down. The train was speeding up, and the pipa music was playing faster and faster. The guerrilla member who was secretly observing was ready to strike, as the train continued on, approaching the platform of [Wang Qiang] station.
0:29:23|0:29:30|[Wang Qiang] drove the train through the platform without hesitation, and the station master at Wanggou Station hurriedly called Gao Xiong to report the situation.
0:29:41|0:29:59|On a hillside along the railway track, Li Zheng has already set up an ambush with the guerrilla team, ready to attack the train. Outside the train carriage, [Liu Hong] is seen holding onto the side of the train with one hand, standing against the wind at the front of the train. As the train is about to reach the hillside, he raises his pistol towards the sky and signals.
0:30:6|0:30:24|Hearing the gunshots, Peng Liang pulled the brake lever to initiate emergency braking on the train, causing it to slow down. Inside the carriage, the guerrilla fighters looked serious, preparing for battle. Lu Han seized the opportunity to smash a Japanese officer's head with a bottle as he peered out of the window across from Wang Qiang.
0:30:25|0:30:44|Other guerrilla fighters also joined in, some pulling out pistols, some grabbing bottles, and others fighting the Japanese soldiers bare-handed. The passengers were startled and started to flee, causing chaos inside the train carriage. One guerrilla fighter was wrestling with a Japanese soldier, and he grabbed an egg from nearby, smashing it forcefully on the soldier's face.
0:30:44|0:30:49|[Xiao Po] then pulled down the window of the train and forcefully wedged the head of the Japanese officer who was looking out towards the window.
0:30:50|0:31:13|The Japanese soldier kept struggling, and Lu Han fiercely smashed him with a super rustic pipa, even shattering the window glass. Seeing the soldier still struggling, Wang Qiang pulled out his pistol and walked over. Wang Qiang shot dead the trapped Japanese officer. In the sound of the gunshot, the train slowly stopped on a cold bridge over the railway.
0:31:13|0:31:19|At the same time, Lu Han and Wang Qiang led the Japanese soldiers to board the armored train, chasing after the robbed train.
0:31:21|0:31:25|At this moment, the passengers gathered under the cold bridge where Lu Han shouted loudly.
0:31:47|0:31:55|The guerrillas pasted slogans such as "Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation" on the outside of the train carriage and threw a straw hat with the word "Ba Luo" written on it next to the train.
0:31:59|0:32:14|Passengers, under the cover of guerrilla fighters, quickly began to disperse and move. The Japanese armored train continued to bombard the train from a distance as it advanced. However, due to the railway being destroyed by the guerrillas, the armored train had to come to a stop.
0:32:17|0:32:19|The Japanese soldier [Kobayashi] observed the situation.
0:32:22|0:32:37|The gunfire from the armored train became more intense, with shells landing one after another beside the railway tracks, and the black smoke from explosions kept rising. After a round of shelling, Lu Han and Wang Qiang led the team to the hijacked train, only to find it empty.
0:32:46|0:32:55|[Lu Han] remained silent, but lowered his head to see the straw hat. He picked up the hat and saw the words "Eighth Route Army" written on it.
0:33:18|0:33:36|Jiangcun led his subordinates to inspect the train carriages, while the postal team members were transferring. [Xiao Po], wearing a Japanese soldier's hat and carrying confiscated ammunition, started singing cheerfully.
0:33:56|0:34:13|Liu Hong finished speaking and left to scout ahead. The other team members scattered to rest. [Peng Liang] sat down leaning against his gun, and [Wang Qiang] stood by his side, brushing off the dust on his clothes. [Peng Liang] took out a cigarette and handed it to [Wang Qiang].
0:34:30|0:34:55|At this moment, ahead, Liu Hong climbed up the hill with [Xiao Po]. They gazed at the vast Weishan Lake, where a few white waves were rippling. The lake water shimmered, surrounded by distant mountains, very peaceful. Seeing such a view, Liu Hong couldn't help but smile and sigh.
0:34:59|0:35:21|However, next to a large rock on the hillside, several Nationalist soldiers sneaked out with cunning looks on their faces. They spotted Liu Hong and [Xiao Po] on the hillside. A Nationalist officer looked through binoculars and signaled to shoot. Liu Hong was shot in the right arm.
0:35:24|0:35:43|Liu Hong fired the pistol with his left hand, returning fire with [Xiao Po]. Nationalist officers commanded a large number of troops to launch an attack on the hillside, the gunfire alarming the guerrilla fighters resting below the hill. They drew their pistols and launched attacks in two directions.
0:35:43|0:35:46|On the hillside, [Liu Hong] fell into a coma due to excessive blood loss.
0:35:47|0:35:54|[Xiao Po] carried [Liu Hong] on his back and ran quickly towards the village in the rice seedlings on the hillside, arriving at the gate of [Fang Lin Sao]'s courtyard.
0:36:5|0:36:19|[Fang Lin Sao] opened the gate of the courtyard and was shocked to see [Lu Hong] being carried by [Wang Qiang]. [Wang Qiang] carried her into the courtyard, and [Fang Lin Sao] quickly closed the gate. [Wang Qiang] laid [Lu Hong] on the kang and helped her sit down.
0:36:19|0:36:34|[Fang Lin Sao] quickly took out a piece of white cloth, tore off a strip, and used it to bandage the head injury of [Lu Hong]. At that moment, outside the courtyard, Nationalist Army officers led their troops in pursuit, running past the doorway of [Fang Lin Sao]'s house.
0:36:36|0:37:3|On the other side, the guerrillas also rushed into the village, pulling out their pistols one after another, engaging in a firefight with the Nationalist Army and driving them back. Inside the house of [Fang Lin Sao], [Liu Hong] lay weakly on the kang with her eyes closed, her head wrapped in white cloth. [Fang Lin Sao] sat by the kang, holding a bowl of soup and feeding [Liu Hong] spoon by spoon.
0:37:6|0:37:29|[Liu Hong] drank the soup, opened his eyes and looked at her affectionately, while [Fang Lin Sao] also gazed warmly at [Liu Hong], the two remained silent. At that moment, [Li Zheng], [Wang Qiang], and several other team members walked in. [Fang Lin Sao] nodded in acknowledgment, picked up the bowl and walked out. [Liu Hong] struggled to sit up.
0:37:32|0:37:39|Supporting [Lu Han] to lie down, the others looked at him with concern. [Lu Han] trembled slightly as he spoke excitedly.
0:37:44|0:37:50|Liu Hong's head tilted towards the militia, with a furrowed brow, saying angrily,
0:37:57|0:37:59|[Liu Hong] unwillingly slammed his fist on the bed board.
0:38:9|0:38:28|[Liu Hong] nodded, but still had a worried look on her face, taking deep breaths. [Li Zheng] comforted her at the bedside. In the office of the special operations headquarters at Zaozhuang Railway Station, [Lu Han] smoked a cigarette, walked to the desk, picked up the clay pipa found in the carriage, and a special agent approached.
0:38:59|0:39:22|In the village, Jiang was lost in thought. At night, in the home of [Fang Lin Sao] in Miao Village, the candle on the table flickered. Liu Hong, who was still recovering, sat in front of the brazier holding the already asleep Feng'er. She slowly put Feng'er on the bed and gently covered her with a blanket.
0:39:22|0:39:44|At this moment, [Fang Lin Sao] walked in with a bowl of chicken soup. She looked pleased and placed the soup on the table. Walking over to Liu Hong, the two exchanged smiles. Then, [Fang Lin Sao] picked up the medical kit from the table, sat down by the washbasin, and added a few pieces of charcoal into it.
0:39:44|0:39:53|Liu Hong also got up from the bedside, took off the bandage on his arm, and sat across from [Fang Lin Sao]. [Fang Lin Sao] uncovered the gauze and carefully changed the medicine.
0:39:56|0:40:13|After applying the medicine, she wrapped herself with a new bandage. During the bandage change, Liu Hong always secretly glanced at [Fang Lin Sao], who would also look back at her from time to time.
0:40:20|0:40:29|Liu Hong spoke, picking up the rifle placed on the table with his right hand, aiming steadily at the imaginary enemy, while [Fang Lin Sao] looked at him affectionately.
0:40:32|0:40:46|Early the next morning, Li Zheng and his team members arrived at [Fang Lin Sao]'s house for a meeting. [Fang Lin Sao] cooked a meal for them. As they sat around the table, [Fang Lin Sao] went to the stove, took out some roasted sweet potatoes, wrapped them in her apron, and stood up.
0:40:46|0:40:52|The little wife in front of the stove smiled and took one from her apron. [Fang Lin Sao] walked to the table.
0:41:13|0:41:30|[Fang Lin Sao] said, then put on her clothes and went out. Liu Hong smiled shyly. Outside the house, [Fang Lin Sao] stood under a big tree at the village entrance, watching. At that moment, three suspicious-looking individuals were seen approaching the village. [Fang Lin Sao] cautiously hid behind the tree, observing them.
0:41:32|0:41:50|Two of them were pushing a small cart, with a person sitting on it. They stopped at the village entrance, and the person on the cart got off with a cane in hand. [Fang Lin Sao] noticed something was wrong, as the person looked around sneakily while walking. It turned out he was a Japanese soldier who had just entered the village.
0:41:52|0:42:11|[Fang Lin Sao] quietly retreated and ran back home. Just as Gang Village noticed, she pulled out a handgun, signaling a large group of plainclothes secret agents hiding behind her to chase after. The gunshots at the village entrance alarmed the guerrilla fighters who were having a meeting. [Fang Lin Sao] arrived in time, Liu Hong ran a few steps, then turned back.
0:42:19|0:42:37|Say it, the two split up and [Fang Lin Sao] jumped over the wall into her own yard. As soon as she landed, she saw the Japanese soldiers had already arrived outside the yard, so she had to hide by the wall. On the other side, Liu Hong, Li Zheng, and [Wang Qiang] successively jumped over the yard wall, swiftly moving away, while [Xiao Po] carried Feng'er on his back.
0:42:38|0:42:54|Entering the courtyard of an old lady, leaving the phoenix with her, and then jumping over the wall to leave, Jiangcun led the undercover Japanese soldiers into the home of [Fang Lin Sao]. They searched roughly everywhere, smashing tables and cabinets to the ground, but found nothing.
0:42:54|0:43:1|They caused chaos in the courtyard, with chickens and dogs running around, and randomly fired guns. Liu Hong, Li Zheng, [Wang Qiang], and [Xiao Po] climbed over the earthen wall to the village entrance.
0:43:12|0:43:26|On the other side, [Fang Lin Sao] is still hiding from the Japanese soldiers in the village. She hides behind a wall and sees a large group of Japanese soldiers rushing into the village. They are meeting with an undercover spy hiding behind a big tree.
0:43:31|0:43:38|They were preparing to take action when suddenly gunshots rang out. It turned out to be [Lu Hong] and [Li Zheng] leading the guerrilla fighters back.
0:43:39|0:43:57|The undercover Japanese soldiers fled in all directions, while the guerrilla fighters threw grenades and charged with guns. [Gangcun] and other Japanese were running out of the house in a panic, but they found themselves surrounded in the courtyard. [Liu Hong] led the guerrilla fighters into the yard and eliminated the undercover Japanese soldiers.
0:43:57|0:44:5|Only [Lu Han] jumped over the wall and escaped from the courtyard, running towards the village without hesitation. [Wang Qiang] kept shooting and chasing after him relentlessly.
0:44:8|0:44:13|When Lu Han ran to the big tree outside the village, he happened to run into Fang Lin Sao hiding behind the tree.
0:44:16|0:44:24|[Fang Lin Sao] flew over and wrestled with [Gang Cun], grabbing her clothes and fiercely smashing a hand grenade towards her head. [Gang Cun] broke free from the clothes and ran away.
0:44:26|0:44:37|[Fang Lin Sao] heard the sound and threw the grenade, but it only hit [Gang Cun] and did not explode, rolling to the ground. Lei Hong hurriedly took the gun to shoot, only to find that there were no bullets left.
0:44:40|0:44:53|Lu Han ran further and further away from the village, successfully escaping. Watching Lu Han flee, Wang Qiang stomped his foot in regret. Afterwards, he picked up an unexploded grenade from the ground.
0:44:55|0:45:7|[Fang Lin Sao] was about to pull the string with her right hand, but was stopped by Liu Hong. [Fang Lin Sao] was extremely frustrated with her mistake, she stomped her foot in regret and angrily threw Jiang Cun's coat on the ground.
0:45:11|0:45:35|At night, the Japanese cavalry entered the Miao Village, starting to set fires recklessly. [Gangcun] with bandages wrapped around his head was commanding, the Japanese soldiers retaliated wildly, plunging the village into a sea of flames. In the morning, [Liu Hong] led the team to the burned Miao Village, where remnants of black smoke still lingered.
0:45:39|0:45:57|The homeless villagers sat by the roadside, looking solemn, with children crying. The guerrilla fighters watched all this with heavy expressions, and [Lu Han] said indignantly.
0:46:9|0:46:26|On a small hill by the lake, the guerrilla team engaged in a battle of attrition with the Japanese invaders. The Japanese troops waved the Japanese flag and launched waves of frenzied attacks. A row of guerrilla members fiercely fired their machine guns.
0:46:36|0:46:48|[Wang Qiang] tried to persuade [Lu Han] without success, so he went to [Fang Lin Sao]'s side. [Wang Qiang] anxiously stomped his feet as [Fang Lin Sao] walked away with a gun.
0:46:50|0:47:7|[Liu Hong] burst into tears, and the guerrilla team's shooting became more intense, with grenades exploding one after another, billowing smoke filling the air. A large number of Japanese soldiers fell in front of the high ground. [Lu Han] laughed excitedly, took out a bottle of wine and drank it in one gulp. In the grass, a Japanese soldier shot at him, knocking the bottle out of his hand.
0:47:7|0:47:12|[Lu Han] angrily threw away the bottle, jumped out of the trench, and shot the Japanese soldier who was shooting at him with a pistol.
0:47:13|0:47:33|Picking up the machine gun from the Japanese soldier, he prepared to shoot, but another Japanese soldier shot him. Holding the machine gun, [Lu Han] started shooting at the Japanese soldiers, but suddenly he was shot in the head. [Wang Qiang] grabbed Xiaobo and threw a grenade at the Japanese soldiers, while others pulled [Lu Han] back into the trench.
0:47:38|0:47:55|The Japanese officer raised his sword high and commanded the soldiers to charge towards the guerrilla position. Liu Hong picked up the machine gun and fought back with the guerrilla members. At this moment, Li Zheng returned by boat. Li Zheng quickly ran to Liu Hong's side.
0:47:58|0:48:6|The Japanese troops kept charging forward, while a large number of monk troops also rushed towards the guerrilla team's position. It seemed like the guerrilla team was about to be surrounded.
0:48:18|0:48:36|Liu Hong said that they needed to continue shooting at the Japanese with machine guns. A large number of Japanese soldiers fell in front of the position. Under Liu Hong's command, the guerrilla members quickly withdrew from the high ground. Just as they left the position, the Japanese started shelling, and the position was instantly covered in smoke.
0:49:13|0:49:28|Lying on the kang, injured [Li Zheng] woke up, and Liu Hong hurried to his side. [Li Zheng] reached out from under the blanket, took out a box of cigarettes, and handed it to Liu Hong.
0:50:13|0:50:29|Liu Hong, with tears in her eyes, held [Li Zheng]'s hands tightly. The scene shifted to the lakeside of Weishan Lake, where Liu Hong hugged [Li Zheng] tightly as he lay on a stretcher. The guerrilla fighters all gathered by the lake, bidding farewell to [Li Zheng] with reluctance.
0:50:51|0:51:0|At this moment, [Fang Lin Sao] arrived at the stretcher of [Li Zheng].
0:51:3|0:51:19|Later, the team members lifted him onto the small boat parked by the lake. The guerrillas watched as the small boat left, only to see it drift further and further away on the calm Weishan Lake. Liu Hong watched the small boat, tears streaming down his face.
0:51:19|0:51:28|In 1941, as the Pacific War broke out, in the meeting room of the Japanese commander Kojima, the Japanese senior officers were waiting for Kojima. When [Peng Liang] walked in with Kojima.
0:51:30|0:51:33|The Japanese commander quickly stood at attention. Little [Lin] opened the map on the table.
0:51:59|0:52:12|On the shore of Weishan Lake, guerrilla fighters are using horse carts instead of trains for shooting practice while on the move. Bullets hit the target gourds, but there is no continuous firing. At this moment, [Lu Han] arrives at the training ground.
0:52:27|0:52:39|The scene shifts, [Fang Lin Sao] puts on a pair of embroidered shoes at home, then she carefully does her makeup in front of the mirror.
0:52:55|0:53:11|In the bustling market, [Fang Lin Sao] sat on a donkey with a bundle, while [Wang Qiang] led the donkey. They passed through the market and arrived at a street corner. [Fang Lin Sao] jumped off the donkey, while [Wang Qiang] tied the donkey and explained something to [Fang Lin Sao].
0:53:17|0:53:39|[Fang Lin Sao] finished speaking and then walked into the street with the package in hand. [Wang Qiang] then met up with [Peng Liang] and walked in another direction towards the street. [Wang Qiang] and the other three team members met up and entered a small restaurant on the side of the street. They walked into a private room and sat down at the dining table.
0:53:39|0:53:45|At this moment, the voices of the customers discussing could be heard from the outdoor dining table.
0:53:59|0:54:18|Lu Han asked the waiter at the restaurant, and the waiter left after speaking. Lu Han smoked and pondered for a moment, then stood up and put down the curtain of the private room.
0:54:23|0:54:35|They started changing clothes. On the other side, [Fang Lin Sao] was arranging the tasks. Meanwhile, the guests in the restaurant were still discussing.
0:55:1|0:55:23|At this moment, the waiter walked through the dining guests with a tray. As he entered the private room, he found it empty. Looking out the window, he saw only the distant figures of four Japanese soldiers. He set down the tray and discovered a stack of banknotes hidden under a teacup on the dining table.
0:55:23|0:55:28|On the platform of Lincheng train station, a large number of Japanese officers are boarding the train, preparing to head to the battlefield.
0:55:31|0:55:50|Against the backdrop of military music, Japanese expatriates cheered loudly, holding banners and flags in celebration. Disguised as Japanese officers, the guerrilla fighters also arrived at the train station, blending into the lively crowd, ready to seize control of the Japanese military band. Liu Hong and other team members approached the military train where the Japanese soldiers were boarding.
0:55:53|0:56:1|Yidao killed the Japanese sentry, Liu Hong and [Peng Liang] quickly climbed onto the front of the military train, subdued the Japanese driver with a pistol, and [Wang Qiang] sat in the driver's seat.
0:56:5|0:56:21|At this moment, the undercover station agent with the signal lamp waved the green light three times to the military train. Upon receiving the signal in the locomotive, Liu Hong signaled to [Xiao Po] under the train head. [Xiao Po] received the signal, blew a whistle, and [Lu Han] changed the original trajectory of the train.
0:56:21|0:56:26|The military train started, full of ammunition and Japanese soldiers, it left the Lincheng train station with full horsepower.
0:56:29|0:56:49|On the platform, Lu Han urgently waved the signal lamp in an attempt to stop the military train. Japanese soldiers on the platform raised their guns to warn. The enemy's military train crowded on the railway. At this moment, a Japanese officer led a group of soldiers, rushing from the top of the train towards the front.
0:56:49|0:56:57|Liu Hong and [Xiao Po] lay on the hood with guns, watching the movements of the Japanese soldiers. Liu Hong turned around, walked to the front of the car, and shoveled coal into the stove.
0:57:4|0:57:19|At this moment, a Japanese train was approaching head-on. [Wang Qiang] accelerated and drove towards the oncoming enemy train, then jumped off the train with other team members. Amid the screams of the enemy, the two trains collided and exploded.
0:57:25|0:57:41|Afterwards, Lu Han and Fang Lin Sao, who learned about the incident, were terrified by the train collision. Following this, there were multiple incidents of Japanese trains derailing and railway bridges being bombed.
0:57:45|0:57:58|In a swift cut, in the command meeting room led by [Fang Lin Sao], she angrily slaps [Lu Han] hard. The other Japanese officers sit silently at the conference table.
0:58:16|0:58:40|Later, a large number of Japanese hunting teams arrived at Lake Weishan. They carried magnetic knives, supplies, and rode small boats to start besieging the guerrilla team on Weishan Island. At night, [Fang Lin Sao] rowed a small boat towards Weishan Island.
0:58:42|0:58:57|On Weishan Island, [Lu Han], [Wang Qiang], and [Fang Lin Sao] stood by the reeds at the lake, observing the situation of the Japanese invaders on the opposite shore. A train roared past on the railway on the other side of the lake, and occasional signal flares from the Japanese invaders rose up by the lake.
0:58:57|0:59:2|[Fang Lin Sao] arrived at Weishan Island, tied up the small boat, and ran towards [Lu Han] and the others.
0:59:49|1:0:2|[Liu Hong] pondered for a moment. That night, a Japanese liaison officer arrived at the command post of the Nationalist Party. He handed a letter to a Nationalist Army officer.
1:0:3|1:0:19|The Japanese liaison officer [Lu Han] nodded. The next day, the Japanese artillery began a fierce bombardment on the guerrilla base on Weishan Island. At the same time, under the cover of the artillery, the Japanese started to attack Weishan Island by steamboat.
1:0:22|1:0:43|The guerrillas, led by [Liu Hong], fired machine guns at the enemies on the steamboat. They threw grenades at the enemy's steamboat, causing some enemies to fall into the water. Some enemies started to land, and with a shout from [Liu Hong], the guerrillas threw grenades one after another, causing explosions.
1:0:43|1:1:1|The invading Japanese soldiers were knocked down by the explosion, but soon another wave of Japanese soldiers rushed up. The Japanese soldiers on the steamboat drew their swords and fought fiercely, firing at each other, bombing the trenches, and the battle became more intense. As the smoke cleared, Liu Hong critically checked the situation of [Xiao Po] beside him.
1:1:5|1:1:9|At this moment, the once peaceful and tranquil Weishan Island is now shrouded in thick smoke.
1:1:20|1:1:43|At dusk, in the Duck Village to the east of Lake Weishan, the Japanese invaders have taken control of the area, setting up checkpoints and conducting strict searches. [Fang Lin Sao] is trapped here and unable to return to Weishan Island. The scene shifts to Weishan Island, where the setting sun casts its glow over the shimmering Lake Weishan amidst the trembling gaps.
1:1:44|1:1:55|[Xiao Po] took out his clay pipa, blew off the dust on it, and began to tune the strings. In the guerrilla base, Lu Han and [Wang Qiang] smoked and chatted.
1:2:58|1:3:3|Some soldiers sang along with the music, while others polished their guns.
1:3:33|1:3:41|In the early morning, guerrilla fighter Peng Liang rowed a small boat to the island for reconnaissance. At this moment, Peng Liang returned. Lu Han looked serious.
1:3:59|1:4:16|[Xiao Po] jumped down with a gun. [Wang Qiang] and the team members all gathered around [Lu Han]. Lu Han was infected by their emotions, he suddenly pulled out his gun, ready to give the order to fight the Japanese invaders, but then he suddenly calmed down.
1:4:34|1:4:40|The guerrilla fighters all walked towards the village, when [Wang Qiang] turned around and approached Lu Han.
1:4:46|1:4:56|The scene shifts to guerrilla fighters disguised as Japanese invaders marching in formation along a mountain road on Weishan Island. Leading the way are Lu Han and [Wang Qiang], disguised as Japanese officers.
1:4:58|1:5:10|Several guerrilla fighters carrying machine guns quickly aimed their guns, preparing for battle. At that moment, in the headquarters of the Japanese encirclement force, [Lu Han] approached Xiao Lin's desk.
1:5:15|1:5:19|Xiao Lin finished reading the battle report. On Weishan Island, a group of Japanese soldiers were searching along the mountain road. At the same time, the guerrilla fighters spotted these enemies.
1:5:49|1:6:1|The guerrilla fighters quickly dispersed and prepared for battle. [Wang Qiang] spoke in a strange language to the Japanese soldiers. The Japanese officer, seeing [Wang Qiang] speaking in the distance, thought he was their own and led the troops away. Liu Hong loaded his pistol and led the team in the opposite direction to search for the Japanese soldiers.
1:6:12|1:6:41|In the evening, Liu Hong led the team from the Great Wall to the edge of the reed marsh by Lake Weishan and began to wade across the lake on foot. At night, the whereabouts of [Fang Lin Sao] were discovered by undercover agents, who then led the Japanese soldiers to start searching for [Fang Lin Sao].
1:6:45|1:7:5|The Japanese soldiers dispersed with torches and began searching the area. [Fang Lin Sao] carried a basket and moved through the reeds, hiding. She took out a grenade and threw it at the Japanese soldiers, then observed the situation ahead. However, a Japanese soldier quietly approached behind her, closer than she had anticipated.
1:7:10|1:7:31|At night, [Lu Han] led a group of Japanese soldiers on a small boat, searching along the reed marshes on the shore of Lake Weishan. At this moment, the guerrilla team waded through the water and arrived at the edge of the reed marshes, where they collided head-on with the Japanese soldiers led by [Lu Han]. [Liu Hong] led the team members to confront the Japanese soldiers.
1:7:45|1:7:58|Gangcun did not answer, turned on the flashlight, and [Liu Hong] also took out a flashlight, exposing both sides' identities. As soon as the words fell, the team members opened fire, catching the devils off guard and causing chaos.
1:8:0|1:8:29|The Japanese soldiers fell into the water one after another, with [Gangcun] flipping under the boat and holding onto the side of the boat. In the melee, the guerrillas opened fire, causing [Lu Han] to fall into the water. The guerrillas threw grenades, overturning the Japanese boat, and the Japanese flag fell into the water. In 1945, the Japanese invaders announced their surrender.
1:8:38|1:8:51|The news of Japan's unconditional surrender spread, and the people joyfully shared the news. At the guerrilla base in the mountains, Fang Lin Sao's daughter Feng Er was happily picking wildflowers on the hillside when Lu Han arrived.
1:9:5|1:9:14|Feng'er ran into the arms of [Lu Han] holding flowers.
1:9:25|1:9:38|Wearing the uniform of the Eighth Route Army, [Li Zheng] rode a horse to the guerrilla base. He waved to the team members in greeting, and they all clapped and surrounded him. [Li Zheng] dismounted and approached [Liu Hong], and they embraced tightly.
1:9:57|1:10:1|Feng'er handed the wild flowers to [Li Zheng], and [Li Zheng] happily picked up Feng'er and kissed her.
1:10:10|1:10:20|[Liu Hong] and [Li Zheng] rode on war horses, leading the guerrilla team members, and started to advance towards the railway side near Lincity. The team of guerrilla members marched out in high spirits.
1:10:25|1:10:49|At this moment, a Nationalist Army colonel is leading his troops, riding proudly towards Lincity. On the other side, the Nationalist Army took over prisoners from the Japanese devils' prison in Lincity, with [Fang Lin Sao] among them.
1:11:14|1:11:36|At the same time, the guerrilla team completed their combat deployment. On the mountain road, [Fang Lin Sao] and other anti-Japanese warriors were tied up by the Nationalist Army and taken to the Lincheng train station. [Lu Han], [Wang Qiang], and [Peng Liang] rode ahead on horses. The rest of the guerrilla team followed closely behind, rushing towards the Nationalist Army.
1:11:47|1:12:4|[Liu Hong] rode a horse, galloping alongside the railway line. At the same time, the Nationalist Army escorted [Fang Lin Sao] and others towards the mountain ravine, preparing for execution by firing squad. [Liu Hong] and the others raced ahead, overtaking a speeding train. In the ravine, soldiers raised their guns, preparing for the execution.
1:12:23|1:12:26|The Nationalist soldiers holding guns fell down one after another, it turned out that the guerrilla fighters arrived just in time.
1:12:51|1:13:7|In the distance, Lu Han, the Japanese soldier Xiao Lin at Lincheng Railway Station, heard the intensive gunfire from afar and felt something was wrong. He ordered the troops to quickly board the train. The Japanese soldiers quickly boarded the armored train. On the other side, Wang Qiang led his team to the necessary route of the Japanese train, but the Japanese armored car had already passed by.
1:13:7|1:13:12|The members of the No Evidence team fiercely fired at the incoming Japanese armored vehicle, but it had little effect.
1:13:14|1:13:33|[Wang Qiang] and [Peng Liang] stood up and led the charge towards the enemy's armored vehicle. At the same time, [Liu Hong] and [Li Zheng] were still engaged in fierce combat with their team. Grenades were thrown by the organic team, causing injuries to the Nationalist soldiers, some falling into the ravine, resulting in the elimination of a large number of Nationalist troops.
1:13:40|1:14:0|At this moment, [Lu Han] found [Fang Lin Sao] who was still tied up. She hugged the weak [Fang Lin Sao], who then fainted in her arms. A Nationalist officer on horseback tried to escape, but [Wang Qiang] fired a shot, missing the target, and then chased after on horseback.
1:14:0|1:14:10|[Liu Hong] saw [Fang Lin Sao], handed her over to [Xiao Po], picked up a rifle, loaded a bullet, aimed, pulled the trigger. With a gunshot, the officer fell off his horse.
1:14:13|1:14:35|On the other side, the Japanese armored vehicle was still speeding along the railway, with Xiao Lin constantly looking out the window inside the car. After Wang Qiang and [Peng Liang] boarded the armored vehicle, they unhooked the connection between the locomotive and the armored carriage.
1:14:35|1:14:42|The locomotive continued to move forward with Wang Qiang and [Peng Liang], while the armored carriages were left behind by Yuan Yong and slowly came to a stop.
1:14:54|1:15:10|The Japanese soldiers opened the door of the armored car and lowered the ladder. [Lu Han] walked down from the armored car. He looked around in confusion, only to find that the locomotive had disappeared, leaving his car standing alone on the railway tracks in the wilderness.
1:15:10|1:15:33|Report, Lu Han took the ultimatum sent by the Flying Tigers, sweat beads appearing on his forehead. Later, Lu Han led the armored vehicle unit, and the inferior team surrendered to the Flying Tigers.
1:15:44|1:15:50|On the locomotive, the guerrilla team raised the red flag high to celebrate the victory. People on both sides of the railway also cheered loudly.
