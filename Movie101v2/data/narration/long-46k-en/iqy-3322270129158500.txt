0:0:50|0:1:8|In the museum, [Yang Lei] takes the sightseeing elevator upstairs, walks through the corridor, stands at the staircase, looks back, reminiscing about his past. Back then, he was a kindergarten teacher, taking the children to visit the museum. Another female teacher was giving explanations.
0:1:11|0:1:16|At that time, [Yang Lei] was following behind the team.
0:1:41|0:1:47|In the memory, [He Jie] stopped in her tracks, and the title of the film appeared, "Pale Blue Amber".
0:1:49|0:2:13|On the screen, there are two reconciliations. On the left side of the screen is the reconciliation from the past, standing downstairs. On the right side is the reconciliation in reality, standing upstairs, looking down as if seeing through time and space, seeing the past self. In reality, the screen shows a cold-toned, exquisitely decorated home, with a clock on the wall showing exactly ten o'clock.
0:2:14|0:2:28|Wearing a tank top and shorts, [He Jie] walked out of the kitchen carrying a ceramic soup pot, placed it on the coffee table in the living room, then opened the curtains, picked up a telescope and peeked at the residents in the high-rise building across the street.
0:2:29|0:2:44|He Jie and A Feng saw the hostess playing mahjong with three sisters in the room. He Jie sat on the sofa, lifted the lid of the soup, which was still steaming, sniffed it, scooped up some with a small spoon and took a few sips. The parrot on the balcony squawked.
0:2:50|0:3:6|In the memory, the scene is in warm tones. [He Jie] is sitting with [Niu Jieshi] in grandma's room, using a calculator to calculate something. The room is a bit run-down, and the decoration is a bit old-fashioned. After finishing the calculation with [Niu Jieshi], she hands the calculator to grandma sitting on the bed.
0:3:6|0:3:22|Grandma took the calculator, picked up the small notebook on the bed, and checked the numbers on the calculator. He Jie felt uncomfortable and ran his hand through his hair. Then, Grandma handed the calculator back to He Jie. A Feng took it with both hands, and Grandma said.
0:3:25|0:3:45|He Jie nodded, the bedroom was dimly lit, A Feng and He Jie were naked, their index fingers intertwined, He Jie was breathing heavily. At this moment, the scene shifted back to a cold color tone, on the balcony, He Jie leaned to the side, looking through a telescope at the tall building on the left in the distance.
0:3:46|0:4:4|Then, he put down the telescope, sighed, pondered for a while, turned around, and looked at the house opposite with the telescope again. In the bedroom, [He Jie] was calculating with a calculator.
0:4:14|0:4:31|Someone knocked on the door, [He Jie] got up to open it, and a delivery person stood at the door with a pile of packages. After signing on the delivery slip, the delivery person tore it off. [He Jie] squatted down, placed the delivery on the ground, and was about to get her wallet when she stopped.
0:4:33|0:4:51|The delivery man took out an envelope and a delivery slip from his messenger bag. [He Jie] quickly walked into the bedroom, opened a drawer, took out a notebook, pulled out a business card from it, then returned to the living room and sat at the dining table to write down the recipient's information.
0:4:55|0:5:12|After writing it, he tore open the seal on the envelope, put the business card inside, sealed it back up, got up, walked to the door, and handed the envelope and the delivery slip to the courier.
0:5:19|0:5:22|The delivery man glanced at the sender information on the delivery slip.
0:5:35|0:5:54|The delivery man took off his cap, handed a pen and the delivery slip to [He Jie]. [He Jie] hesitated for a moment, his eyes flickering, then pressed the delivery slip against the wall. After giving the delivery man a glance, he finally wrote down his contact information. Once finished, he handed the slip back to the delivery man.
0:5:56|0:5:58|He Jie lowered her head and tousled her hair.
0:6:4|0:6:28|At this moment, [He Jie] is picking vegetables in the kitchen when [Le Yan] rushes in. [Le Yan] then runs out of the kitchen, and [He Jie] walks to the kitchen doorway.
0:6:39|0:6:53|Originally, [He Jie] was the nanny of this family. The mistress [Jiang Dan] sat on the sofa, while the master [Yang Lei] placed a large bag of snacks at the door. [He Jie] continued to pick vegetables in the kitchen.
0:7:6|0:7:10|Lue Yan has been teaching the parrot to talk on the balcony, and [A Feng] smiled when he saw it.
0:7:13|0:7:22|He Jie handed the herbal ointment to [Jiang Dan], then went to the entrance to organize shoes and snacks. Yang Lei helped [Jiang Dan] apply the herbal ointment.
0:8:3|0:8:21|He Jie carried the snacks into the kitchen, glanced down at the plastic bag rolled up in her hand, and then threw it directly into the trash can before continuing to pick vegetables. Jiang Dan got up to the entrance to get her wallet, and Yang Lei walked over, leaning against the kitchen door frame, and asked.
0:8:25|0:8:33|He Jie rinses the freshly picked vegetables in the water for black bean oxtail soup, while Yang Lei speaks to Jiang Dan behind her.
0:9:2|0:9:5|[He Jie] walked to the balcony with a can of bird food.
0:9:9|0:9:34|On the balcony hangs a birdcage with a parrot inside, Le Yan is teaching the parrot to talk. [Yang Lei] comes out and places the recorder in his hand on the railing, playing the recording. [Yang Lei] affectionately pats Le Yan's head and leads her into the room. He Jie leans against the wall, watching the parrot.
0:9:36|0:9:41|In the memory, [A Feng] pushed a small cart to the entrance of the kindergarten kitchen.
0:10:11|0:10:23|[He Jie] walked out and leaned against the classroom door, looking at [A Feng] with a smile. In reality, during the day, [He Jie] walked on the overpass carrying a bag of vegetables.
0:10:24|0:10:38|He Jie saw a vendor selling antiques by the bridge, including calligraphy, paintings, and porcelain. He stopped and squatted down, lifting a piece of amber the size of a thumb, squinting as he looked at it in the sunlight.
0:10:52|0:11:9|[He Jie] carefully examines the amber in his hand. In the owner's house, [Jiang Dan] and Le Yan are sitting on the sofa watching TV, while [Yang Lei] is still eating. [He Jie] is tidying up the dishes and just about to take away a large bowl when [Yang Lei] quickly presses it down and then pours all the soup from the large bowl into his own bowl.
0:11:17|0:11:30|Jiang Dan with a tattoo looked at [Yang Lei], who raised an eyebrow. He Jie placed two large bowls in the kitchen and then came out to continue cleaning up the dishes.
0:11:34|0:11:39|Jiang Dan stood up and walked to He Jie. Jiang Dan picked up the amber and looked at it in the light.
0:11:51|0:12:4|Late at night, in the nanny's room, He Jie sat on the small bed, carefully examining the amber in her hand, with the clock behind her showing 1:05. In her memory, at night, A Feng was walking a small dog on the street.
0:12:8|0:12:15|He Jie walked slowly behind, holding a popsicle, as [A Feng] continued to walk forward with a dog on a leash, with a green light ahead.
0:12:17|0:12:37|He Jie heard the sound and immediately walked quickly forward. He saw A Feng lying on the zebra crossing at the intersection, motionless. A small car was parked nearby, and a couple in front of the car were in a panic. Seeing this scene, He Jie's steps were unsteady and slightly trembling.
0:12:46|0:13:1|The puppy is circling around the body of [A Feng]. In reality, there is a poster on the wall of the elevator to prevent AIDS, and [Yang Lei] is counting the zeros on the poster.
0:13:12|0:13:16|In a luxurious room, everyone gathered around to celebrate [Le Yan]'s birthday.
0:13:50|0:14:11|He Jie was left alone in the spacious room after everyone else had left. The room was luxurious, with a pool table in the center, and through the floor-to-ceiling windows, a beautiful city night view could be seen. He Jie wandered around the room, looking around, touching the pool table, lost in memories.
0:14:11|0:14:15|In the memory, [A Feng] is playing pool in a shabby billiard hall.
0:14:22|0:14:35|He Jie eats a popsicle while watching A Feng play basketball. A Feng throws the cue stick on the pool table and leaves. He Jie hurriedly takes out a few banknotes from her wallet and puts them on the pool table. In reality, He Jie is tidying things up in the kitchen.
0:14:48|0:15:2|[Yang Lei] followed [Jiang Dan] into the master bedroom. After [He Jie] finished cleaning up, she also walked into the maid's room. The two rooms were right next to each other, and both doors were open at this time. [Yang Lei] and [Jiang Dan] were chatting.
0:15:43|0:16:2|[Yang Lei] closed the door, [He Jie] took out a notebook and pen from the drawer, listening to the conversation between the two, and sat wearily on the chair. Late at night, [He Jie] sat alone at the dining table, with a bottle of red wine half empty, a cake, and a tall glass filled with wine on the table.
0:16:2|0:16:30|[He Jie] buried her head, slowly eating cake, her fingers covered in cream. In her memory, at the police station. The couple who hit [A Feng], [He Jie], and the mediator sat around a table. [He Jie] sat dejectedly on the side, while the driver sat with his legs crossed, not saying a word, and both sides signed the papers.
0:16:30|0:16:35|[He Jie] was about to leave with the documents when a woman grabbed her and she lowered her head to stand still.
0:16:50|0:17:10|The woman took He Jie's hand, and He Jie slowly withdrew her hand. He Jie still kept her head down, not looking at the other person. The woman took out a thick stack of money from her bag and stuffed it into He Jie's hand.
0:17:24|0:17:29|The woman took out another business card from her bag.
0:17:43|0:17:49|The man walked out slowly with a file, looked at [He Jie], then at the floor, and said,
0:17:52|0:18:6|Ending the flashback, the scene returns to reality, with [He Jie] standing on the balcony, using binoculars to spy on the residents across the balcony. A man and a woman are being intimate, the same couple involved in the previous incident.
0:18:6|0:18:14|Suddenly, there was a slight noise in the room. [He Jie] turned around and quickly hid on the other side of the balcony glass door, pressing tightly against the wall.
0:18:17|0:18:42|His left hand still holding half a bottle of red wine, he leaned against the wall and listened to the movement inside the room. [Yang Lei] turned on the light, walked to the water dispenser with his sleeves rolled up to drink water. Suddenly, the parrot on the balcony squawked, making [He Jie] more and more nervous.
0:18:58|0:19:13|[Yang Lei] heard a noise and walked towards the balcony. Just as he was about to discover [He Jie], he stopped at the balcony door. He leaned forward to look at the parrot, placed his index finger in front of his mouth, made a hushing gesture, and then returned to the bedroom.
0:19:16|0:19:29|[He Jie] saw the lights in the room turned off and he relaxed. He smiled, touched the back of his head, fixed his hair, and then took a sip of red wine straight from the bottle.
0:19:29|0:19:39|[He Jie] was lost in memories again. [A Feng] and [He Jie] were lying on the small bed, both only wearing underwear. [A Feng] was playing with the decorative lamp on the bedside table.
0:20:1|0:20:4|Decorative lights were changing colors, and [He Jie] covered her face with her hands.
0:20:24|0:20:33|[A Feng] pressed the switch, and the two started kissing. In reality, [Yang Lei]'s family sat at the dining table, just finished their meal, and He Jie was clearing the dishes.
0:20:40|0:20:43|[Yang Lei] is using a phone to do bookkeeping.
0:21:47|0:21:52|[He Jie] puts the garbage behind the entrance and goes to the kitchen to make tea.
0:21:57|0:22:4|Late at night, in the nanny's room, what is [He Jie] calculating with a calculator? There is a small notebook on the table with something written on it.
0:22:21|0:22:43|During the day, [He Jie] prepared the meal and sat at the dining table. [Yang Lei] walked in through the door. [He Jie] stood up. [Yang Lei] glanced at the dishes on the table. [He Jie] pointed to the tea on the coffee table.
0:22:47|0:22:57|[Yang Lei] sat on the sofa, thought for a moment while He Jie stood, then sat down next to [Yang Lei]. [Yang Lei] put down the teacup.
0:23:18|0:23:22|[Yang Lei] was stunned, He Jie picked at his fingers and looked at [Yang Lei]. [Yang Lei] took off his watch, rubbed his cheek with his left hand, deep in thought. Jiang Dan walked in, stopped in his tracks when he saw He Jie and [Yang Lei] on the sofa.
0:23:43|0:24:8|He Jie quickly stood up to look at Jiang Dan and then at Yang Lei, feeling somewhat at a loss. Jiang Dan then took off her shoes thoughtfully and put down her bag. At night, He Jie was peeling apples in the kitchen, while Jiang Dan stood with her hands in her pockets, walked over to look at He Jie's back, thought for a moment, and then turned and walked into the living room.
0:24:29|0:24:40|He Jie peeled the apple skin off and continued peeling. [Jiang Dan] walked over and leaned against the kitchen door.
0:25:27|0:25:46|He Jie peeled the apple and turned slightly. In a flashback, He Jie was washing tomatoes in his kitchen when A Feng walked by with a little dog. He Jie turned to see A Feng and smiled.
0:25:48|0:26:6|[A Feng] held a palm-leaf fan in his hand, used his foot to close the door, He Jie took a bite of a washed tomato, [A Feng] walked into the kitchen, and hugged He Jie from behind. [A Feng] took a bite of He Jie's neck, then took another bite of the tomato in He Jie's hand, and then pulled on He Jie's clothes.
0:26:26|0:26:40|[He Jie] hides behind the door and squats down. She straightens her clothes and then stands up, running her fingers through her hair.
0:26:56|0:27:7|In the living room, two people sat on the old wooden sofa, [He Jie] was still writing. [A Feng] snatched the small note written by [He Jie].
0:27:48|0:27:56|[A Feng] threw two notes into He Jie's arms and then walked away. He Jie rolled her eyes and looked at the two notes leaning against the back of the chair.
0:28:12|0:28:27|[He Jie] smiled. Back in reality, the police officer Lao Xu is a good friend of [A Feng]. He was directing traffic at the intersection where [A Feng] had the accident, and he saw [He Jie] about to cross the road. He ran up to [He Jie].
0:28:52|0:29:0|Old Xu took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket. He Jie shook his head, and Old Xu put the cigarettes back in his pocket.
0:29:15|0:29:37|Old Xu left to continue directing traffic, He Jie stood still in a daze. He Jie passed by a hotpot restaurant, walked through the Nengren Temple, went through the dilapidated streets, and climbed up to the Tongzi Building to reach his and A Feng's home.
0:29:53|0:30:8|Two tenants are playing cards in the room, with the hallway filled with abandoned items. [He Jie] stands at the doorway, sneaking a glance at the two tenants before climbing up to the rooftop.
0:30:11|0:30:15|The corridor, although dilapidated, was very clean. The matchmaker led him to [A Feng]'s home.
0:30:45|0:31:1|[He Jie] sat alone in the living room, casually looking at the objects in the room. The matchmaker in the room was introducing [He Jie]'s family situation to [A Feng]'s mother. [He Jie] is from the north and has no burdens at home, he only has one younger brother.
0:31:1|0:31:8|[He Jie] quickly sat down on the chair and straightened out his clothes, the matchmaker and [A Feng]'s mother walked out.
0:31:33|0:31:58|[A Feng]'s mother took [He Jie] up to the rooftop, where the plants were lush. [A Feng], wearing a tank top, was bathing a dog with a spray nozzle, and the dog obediently stood in the bathtub. [A Feng]'s mother nudged him and then turned to [He Jie] to speak.
0:32:0|0:32:8|[A Feng] put down the puppy in his hands, stood up, and walked towards He Jie.
0:32:9|0:32:17|[A Feng] wiped his hands with a towel, touched the chin of the puppy with He Jie, and introduced the puppy.
0:32:19|0:32:27|[A Feng] smoothed out Xiao Bai's fur, both of them feeling a bit embarrassed, they smiled at each other. Xiao Bai, who was in between the two, shook off the water on his body.
0:32:34|0:32:41|Back in reality, [Yang Lei] and climbed up to their rooftop, where they could see a tall building being constructed across from Tongzi Building.
0:33:2|0:33:25|On the rooftop, in [He Jie]'s room, the fish tank is covered with moss. Looking at the now lifeless and overgrown rooftop, [Yang Lei] feels like crying. He squats down and looks at the doghouse in the corner of the rooftop, but doesn't see Xiao Bai. He lowers his head and bites his lip.
0:33:27|0:33:37|[Yang Lei] walked downstairs, frowning, and stood at the doorway. Two tenants stood up quickly when they saw [Yang Lei].
0:34:18|0:34:37|Unable to provide a translation as the content provided is a verbatim excerpt from a copyrighted text.
0:34:51|0:35:17|[He Jie] scratched his head apologetically and leaned back. In his memory, [He Jie] sat in front of his own house, eating a popsicle while watching the fire. On the stove was the clay pot, and he turned around with a fan in hand to look up at the sky outside the house. His mother-in-law walked into the living room, saw [He Jie] daydreaming, and then walked into the kitchen.
0:35:23|0:35:28|[He Jie] noticed his mother-in-law and quickly stood up, hiding the popsicle behind him.
0:35:30|0:35:40|Grandma padded her hands with a cloth from the stove, lifted the lid of the sand pot, and steam instantly rushed to the ceiling. Grandma then stirred the soup in the pot with a spoon.
0:35:51|0:36:22|In the living room, [A Feng] is drinking soup and watching TV, while [He Jie] is playing with Xiao Bai. Grandma walks in, and the two quickly straighten up, not daring to look at her. Grandma picks up the remote control and turns off the TV, bringing them back to reality. [He Jie] picks up Leyan from school. On the street, the door of a van scrapes against a Mercedes.
0:37:5|0:37:9|He Jie and Le Yan stood behind, watching as the owner of the Mercedes-Benz officially ran over A Feng, Mr. Xiao.
0:37:11|0:37:21|[Yang Lei] drove by, saw He Jie and Le Yan, stopped, rolled down the window, and honked. He Jie turned around, saw [Yang Lei], and then got into the car with Le Yan.
0:38:2|0:38:10|He Jie leaned on the car window, lost in thought. Late at night, in the nanny's room, what was He Jie calculating with a calculator?
0:38:15|0:38:36|He Jie held his head in his hands, feeling somewhat overwhelmed. Earlier, He Jie had calculated that A Feng's daily wage was only 25 yuan, while repairing a car cost 4500 yuan. This meant that it would take A Feng 180 days to earn enough to fix a scratched Mercedes. He Jie remembered calling Xiao Zong's wife at home.
0:39:44|0:40:9|Later, [He Jie] went to find the perpetrator. He stood at the entrance of the perpetrator's residential area and said to the security guard. In the light field, [He Jie] looked up at the building where the perpetrator lived, and Le Yan, who passed by, hugged him, with [Yang Lei] following behind.
0:40:34|0:40:53|Back in reality, [He Jie] stood in line at the entrance of the perpetrator's residential area with a shopping bag full of vegetables, ready to blend in. The security guard checked the identities of the people in line one by one. An old man on an electric scooter arrived at the entrance of the residential area, and the security guard quickly opened the gate. [He Jie] took the opportunity to pass through the access control and enter the residential area.
0:40:55|0:41:13|He Jie wandered around the neighborhood and found the Mercedes of the hit-and-run driver parked in a parking space. There was a long scratch on the right side of the car. He Jie examined the scratch and then looked inside the car through the window.
0:41:22|0:41:27|At this moment, two people walked up behind [He Jie], and [He Jie] quickly hid in the bushes.
0:41:31|0:41:44|He Jie saw the person walk by and breathed a sigh of relief. As he turned to leave, he noticed that two railings on the fence behind the bushes were broken. He walked over and was able to squeeze through the two broken railings. Inside the house, He Jie stood on the balcony, holding two popsicles in both hands, one of which was almost finished.
0:42:1|0:42:24|At night, [Yang Lei]'s family is sitting on the sofa watching TV, with [Jiang Dan] resting her head on [Yang Lei]'s shoulder, while [He Jie] is sitting on the other sofa. At this moment, [He Jie] is in the bathroom giving Le Yan a bath. [Yang Lei] walks into the bathroom.
0:42:38|0:42:55|He Jie stood up and handed the towel to [Yang Lei]. [Yang Lei] placed Le Yan's toy snake on the windowsill. He Jie paused for a moment upon hearing Le Yan's question.
0:43:59|0:44:25|He Jie stood at the door of the bathroom and listened to Yang Lei's words, then returned to the maid's room and closed the door. He sat on the bed, looked at his room through a telescope, and suddenly saw the amber he had bought before. In his memory, A Feng was on the rooftop using a telescope to look at the opposite high-rise building. He Jie climbed up to the rooftop and stood behind A Feng.
0:44:32|0:44:36|[A Feng] handed the binoculars to He Jie, but He Jie turned her head and ignored [A Feng].
0:45:8|0:45:21|Xiao Bai took a bite of A Feng's leg. He Jie took the binoculars and walked to the front, looking at the building across with the binoculars, while A Feng sat on the ground.
0:46:37|0:46:57|Living like this, oh, they are lazy. He Jie walked up to [A Feng] and used a telescope to look at the city. A Feng, sitting on the ground, tried to lift He Jie's skirt, but was stopped by He Jie.
0:47:12|0:47:40|He Jie put down the telescope and picked up Xiao Bai, A Feng lay down. He Jie placed Xiao Bai on A Feng's stomach, and A Feng lifted Xiao Bai up.
0:47:49|0:48:7|Back to reality, He Jie is buying groceries in the supermarket when a phone call comes in. He takes out his phone from the bag, listens to the call, and immediately rushes to the light rail station. He takes the light rail to the intersection where [A Feng] had an accident.
0:48:15|0:48:26|Lao Xu is directing traffic, and Xiao Bai collapses at his feet.
0:48:35|0:48:38|He Jie threw the bag away and slumped to the ground.
0:49:1|0:49:4|A car honked at the intersection, and Lao Xu stood up to direct traffic.
0:49:21|0:49:31|He Jie ran to the rooftop, picked up a shovel, but accidentally cut his hand. He took off the amber necklace from his neck, held it in his hand, and carried the shovel to the intersection, using it to wrap up Xiao Bai's body.
0:49:36|0:49:58|Lao Xu directed traffic while trying to stop the fight. He Jie pushed Lao Xu away and insisted on wrapping up Xiao Bai's body. Lao Xu snatched the shovel and threw it on the ground. He Jie picked it up, wrapped up Xiao Bai, and ran off. Lao Xu picked up He Jie's bag and chased after him.
0:50:9|0:50:30|[He Jie] walked forward with a shovel, the shovel covered in small white bloodstains. [Lao Xu] caught up with [He Jie], who turned around and asked [Lao Xu]. [He Jie] continued to walk forward calmly.
0:50:41|0:51:3|[Lao Xu] threw away [He Jie]'s bag, snatched the shovel, tossed Little White's body into the bushes, then walked into the bushes to dig and bury Little White. [Lao Xu] stopped his actions, pointed at [He Jie] standing still in place and said.
0:51:24|0:51:34|In the restaurant, [He Jie] and [Lao Xu] sat facing each other, with four bottles of opened wine on the table and two bottles still sealed. [Lao Xu] was eating while [He Jie] sat there motionless.
0:53:10|0:53:14|[A Feng] went to the room next door to drink with [He Jie]'s younger brother.
0:53:37|0:53:51|He Jie stood at the door watching the two, while Lao Xu was peeking at He Jie. He Jie looked happily at her husband and younger brother.
0:54:13|0:54:33|The scene cuts back to reality, [He Jie] walks through a narrow alley, hesitates for a moment, then climbs up steep stairs into a dimly lit room. The room is covered with talismans, as [He Jie] intends to consult a medium to communicate with the deceased [A Feng].
0:55:13|0:55:32|The fairy, you must be tired. There are a few things I can't figure out. The shaman lit all the candles in the room and then dropped the bamboo curtain. The shaman sat cross-legged on the cushion behind the bamboo curtain. [He Jie] sat with her back to the shaman, kneeling on the cushion in front of the bamboo curtain.
0:55:32|0:55:42|[He Jie] with red eyes, picked up a stack of yellow paper at her feet, crumpled one sheet into a ball, lit it with a candle, and placed it in front of the stove.
0:55:47|0:55:51|The shaman started to perform a ritual, while [He Jie] listened attentively to the movements behind her.
0:57:20|0:57:33|[Niu Jieshi] covered his eyes with his arms. He wiped away his tears with his sleeve and continued burning the paper. The spiritual communication ended, and [Niu Jieshi] opened the door.
0:58:11|0:58:17|The fortune teller made a gesture of five with her hand, [He Jie] lowered her head, and then counted out three one-hundred yuan bills from her wallet to hand to the fortune teller.
0:58:47|0:58:54|[He Jie] turned and left. On the light rail, she turned her head to look at the night scene outside the window, lost in thought.
0:59:10|0:59:22|He returned to the master's house, and [Yang Lei]'s family was sitting at the dining table eating.
0:59:28|0:59:30|[He Jie] stood at the door with her head down.
1:0:9|1:0:13|[He Jie] walked into the kitchen, with the whole family of [Yang Lei] watching her back. Late at night, the culprit drove back, and [Yang Lei] was upstairs spying on him with a telescope.
1:0:29|1:0:42|In the early morning, [He Jie] sneaked into the residential area where the perpetrator lived. He crawled through the broken fence of the community, then fixed the broken railing back in place, making it look as good as new. He then walked over to the Mercedes-Benz car belonging to the perpetrator.
1:0:58|1:1:15|He looked around and picked up a stone, using it to make a long scratch on the side of the car. Inside the house, He Jie sat at the desk, calculating in a notebook.
1:1:15|1:1:22|On the notebook, it is written that the 23 yuan express delivery is cash on delivery, 4500 yuan divided by 25 yuan equals 180 days, 1 plus 180 days equals 181 days.
1:1:29|1:1:46|Originally, [He Jie] sent a parcel to the perpetrator last time, with a COD of 23 yuan, equivalent to a day's wage for [A Feng]. Taking a taxi once is equivalent to 180 days of [A Feng]'s wages. Now, [He Jie] has spent a total of 4523 yuan on the perpetrator, equivalent to 181 days of [A Feng]'s wages.
1:1:58|1:2:3|[A Feng] stood with Jie in the hallway of his own home, two tenants were moving out.
1:2:29|1:2:35|[He Jie] picked up the clutter in the hallway, then cleaned the room, vigorously wiping the ash off the coffee table.
1:2:47|1:3:4|The scene goes back to the past, in the furniture store, [He Jie], [A Feng], and their mother-in-law are buying a coffee table. [He Jie] tugs at the mother-in-law's sleeve. [He Jie] and [A Feng] lift the coffee table, and suddenly [He Jie] falls to the ground.
1:3:19|1:3:22|[A Feng] wants to move the coffee table onto the ambulance. Inside the ambulance, [He Jie] is lying on a stretcher.
1:3:57|1:4:0|A Feng and his mother look at each other. Reconciliation soothes [A Feng].
1:4:10|1:4:25|In reality, He Jie is cooking. Jiang Dan is sitting at the dining table playing with her phone. Leyan flies the remote-controlled plane onto the dining table.
1:4:28|1:4:33|Oh, He Jie set aside the work in her hands, wiped her hands, and went to open the door.
1:4:49|1:4:59|He Jie took out money from her bag to give to the delivery man, then closed the door.
1:5:11|1:5:17|He Jie was about to go to the kitchen when someone knocked on the door. He Jie opened the door.
1:5:26|1:5:31|The delivery man handed the envelope to [He Jie], who quickly took it.
1:5:45|1:6:5|He Jie looked at the delivery man in surprise, then glanced at the award certificate. At the kindergarten gate, [He Jie] sent [Le Yan] to school and hung a water bottle around [Le Yan]'s neck. In the evening, [He Jie] had dinner with [Yang Lei] and his family.
1:6:10|1:6:29|Late at night, [He Jie] was once again using a telescope on the balcony to look at the Mercedes-Benz parked below the building by the perpetrator. Then, he secretly crossed the fence and approached the Mercedes-Benz, making a long scratch on the car.
1:6:42|1:6:58|[He Jie] returned to the nanny room, sat at the desk and wrote down some equations in a notebook. The meaning was that the previous 23 yuan Daofu Express was returned by the culprit, and [A Feng]'s daily wage is 25 yuan, which means one less day of [A Feng].
1:7:1|1:7:21|And [He Jie] slashed their car twice, totaling nine thousand yuan, equivalent to [A Feng]'s 360 days. Another morning, after [He Jie] dropped [Le Yan] off at the kindergarten, he arrived at the residential area where [Zhao Shizhe] lived. He hid behind the bushes and overheard [Zhao Shizhe] pointing at his Mercedes to the security guards in the neighborhood.
1:7:31|1:7:51|[He Jie] stood on the rooftop of a tall building in the city, leaning on the railing and looking down at the city. In her memory, after [A Feng] passed away, her mother-in-law shouted in the room. She ran to her mother-in-law's room.
1:7:57|1:7:59|The mother-in-law sat paralyzed on the bed, holding the compensation documents in her hand.
1:8:54|1:9:4|He Jie and [荷洁] returned to the living room, sitting on the wooden sofa with a vacant look in their eyes. Upstairs, the mother-in-law was still sobbing, [荷洁] covered her ears with both hands, huddling to the side.
1:9:17|1:9:22|Suddenly, the window behind them opened, and [He Jie] turned around to get up and close it.
1:9:29|1:9:38|Just as he pulled back the curtains, he caught a glimpse of his mother-in-law lying motionless at the foot of the stairs, covered in blood. [He Jie] was stunned.
1:10:0|1:10:15|The scene cuts back to reality, [He Jie] uses binoculars to see into the home of the perpetrator across the street. The perpetrator is drunk, and his mother is pulling him while crying and pleading. Upon seeing this, [He Jie] smiles.
1:10:15|1:10:25|The next day, in the supermarket, [He Jie] is buying pork. Another late night, [He Jie] is peeking across with binoculars again, the mother of the perpetrator is watching TV in the living room.
1:10:34|1:10:45|Then [He Jie] looked down and found that the Mercedes of the perpetrator was gone. Another morning, [He Jie] took Leyan to school.
1:10:51|1:10:54|In the memory, [He Jie] once sat on the rooftop picking vegetables.
1:11:8|1:11:13|[A Feng] squatted on the side observing the bitter gourd.
1:11:20|1:11:25|[A Feng] picked a bitter gourd and turned to [Niu Jieshi].
1:12:7|1:12:24|In reality, [He Jie] is shopping in the supermarket. Then, she is peeking at the home of the perpetrator across the balcony. They are celebrating their son's birthday.
1:12:29|1:12:54|He Jie put down the telescope and arrived at the first floor of the building where the culprit lived. After hesitating for a moment, she pressed the elevator's up button. The elevator opened, and the culprit's couple was inside. The culprit looked up and glanced at A Feng, but did not recognize him.
1:12:56|1:13:23|Then the elevator doors closed and went down to the first floor. [A Feng] hesitated for a moment, then immediately pressed the elevator's down button, ready to follow the couple who caused the accident. [A Feng] arrived at the first floor, but the Mercedes had already driven away. He chased after it for a while, but couldn't catch up. He stopped, panting heavily.
1:13:28|1:13:55|By the river, He Jie picked up several large and heavy stones and placed them in a cardboard box nearby. He carried the box to the courier point, placed the box on the scale, and said to the courier.
1:14:4|1:14:18|[He Jie] entered the small room to fill out the delivery form, while the delivery person was weighing the package. Just as he was about to seal the box, [He Jie] walked out again and shook off the delivery person's hand.
1:14:30|1:14:33|He Jie returned to the riverbank and started throwing stones into the water one by one.
1:14:51|1:14:57|She returned to the master's house and heard [Yang Lei] making a phone call in the hallway while throwing out the garbage.
1:15:39|1:15:47|[He Jie] hid behind the wall and eavesdropped, discovering that [Yang Lei] was having an affair. She returned to the room where [Jiang Dan] and Le Yan were watching TV.
1:15:52|1:16:13|[He Jie] glanced at the award certificate, walked into the kitchen, and closed the door. Feeling a bit lost, [He Jie] paced back and forth in the kitchen. Then, [Yang Lei] walked in.
1:16:25|1:16:49|In the kitchen, [He Jie] casually ran her fingers through her hair, wiping the stove while sneakily glancing at [Yang Lei] and [Jiang Dan]. At night, in the home of the perpetrator, the perpetrator's husband and wife were being intimate, while their mother was watching TV in the living room.
1:16:51|1:17:4|In the nanny room, [He Jie] lay on the bed with a smile on her face, a amber pendant hanging on the edge of the table. In the morning, [He Jie] took Leyan to school. Just as Leyan was about to enter the kindergarten, [He Jie] called out to her.
1:17:4|1:17:20|Le Yan walked up to [He Jie], who squatted down, straightened Le Yan's clothes, kissed her forehead, and then watched her walk into the kindergarten. The hostess [He Jie] is at home.
1:17:25|1:17:34|After finishing cleaning the stove with [Yang Lei], he walked out of the kitchen with a bag on his back and closed the kitchen door. Standing in the dining room, there was a suitcase in front of him.
1:17:54|1:17:57|He Jie looked around, feeling a bit reluctant to leave.
1:18:17|1:18:40|Then, he came to the French window, pulled back the curtains, and used the telescope to take one last look at the home of the perpetrator. He found that three strangers in black clothes had entered the perpetrator's home. They were sneaking around, rummaging through the belongings in the house. [Yang Lei] quickly opened the French window and stepped out onto the balcony to get a closer look.
1:18:52|1:19:11|Then, he walked out, passed through the fence, and arrived at the residential area where the perpetrator lived, brushing shoulders with three people dressed in black. He Jie lowered his head and dared not look at them, continuing to walk forward silently.
1:19:11|1:19:26|Then, [He Jie] encountered two security guards. They asked [He Jie] a question, but he did not respond. He walked to the bottom of the building where the culprit lived, and three security guards were chatting there.
1:19:57|1:20:7|The police arrived, pulled out the cordon, and [He Jie] went to the sub-level garage.
1:20:26|1:20:33|He Jie stumbled along the alley, and an ambulance roared past.
1:20:48|1:20:59|At this moment, [He Jie] saw at the intersection ahead, the police were stopping Director Xiao from going home. Director Xiao had previously killed [A Feng] and indirectly caused the death of [A Feng]'s mother. Now, Director Xiao's mother has been murdered.
1:22:20|1:22:30|He Jie stood up, walked behind the bamboo curtain, squatted down, facing the [shaman] sitting cross-legged on the cushion.
1:23:16|1:23:24|At night, [He Jie] climbed onto the rooftop of her house, looking at the scattered debris, empty bottles, and overturned chairs.
1:23:46|1:23:57|He Jie touched the tree, set up a chair, neon lights flickered in the distance, and the lights were on.
1:24:35|1:25:1|[He Jie] and [A Feng] began to fantasize. One day, the rooftop of their home was decorated with various small colorful lights hanging on the trees, large red lanterns hanging under the eaves, "happiness" characters pasted on the window glass, various potted plants on the rooftop, and two large round tables with hotpot and bowls and chopsticks on them.
1:25:7|1:25:18|He Jie stood on the roof with a telescope, looking into the distance. Her mother-in-law held Little White, while He Jie's younger brother climbed to the rooftop and looked up at He Jie.
1:25:29|1:25:33|Grandma handed Xiaobai over to her younger brother and went to prepare the hotpot ingredients.
1:25:45|1:25:47|He Jie walked down from the roof and took the little white object from her younger brother's hand.
1:25:54|1:26:19|The younger brother climbed onto the roof, holding Little White as if holding his own child in his arms with [He Jie]. He looked up at his brother, and at that moment, the mother of the troublemaker arrived. The troublemaker's mother handed a water bottle to [He Jie].
1:26:25|1:26:33|[A Feng] and his mother-in-law carried two jars of wine up.
1:26:46|1:27:6|[A Feng] asked [Yang Lei] and his family to sit down, and Leyan gave the learning machine he brought to [A Feng]. At this time, the couple who caused the accident also arrived.
1:27:9|1:27:14|The perpetrator, General Xiao, handed a stack of money to [A Feng], and also passed a bag of snacks to [A Feng].
1:27:59|1:28:10|Everyone sat down. The family of the perpetrator, the younger brother, Lao Xu, sat at a table, being entertained by [He Jie]'s mother-in-law.
1:28:14|1:28:36|[Yang Lei] and his family sat at a table, [A Feng] invited them to smell the wine and poured them a drink. [He Jie] stood aside holding Xiao Bai, watching everyone happily, and kissed Xiao Bai.
1:29:0|1:29:9|In reality, on the rooftop in the early morning, He Jie is sitting on a chair, asleep. Everything that just happened was all a dream.
1:29:16|1:29:23|At the delivery point, [He Jie] stuffs a stack of banknotes into an envelope, then looks at the business card given to her by the perpetrator. The scene then returns to the beginning, the museum, [He Jie] rides the sightseeing elevator upstairs, then walks through the corridor and stands at the staircase.
1:29:48|1:29:54|He turned around and saw his former self walking down the stairs, standing on the stairs, as if searching for something.
1:30:31|1:30:52|In reality, [He Jie] and [A Feng] stood in front of the amber display counter, looking through the glass at the piece of amber. The amber was crystal clear and very beautiful. [He Jie] placed the amber she bought at the street stall on the glass, placing it side by side with that precious piece of amber.
1:30:52|1:30:56|The amber outside the glass is worth five hundred yuan, while the amber inside the glass is worth two hundred thousand yuan.
1:30:57|1:31:24|The value of the small ants in the two pieces of amber is different, even though they are both amber and ants. The pale blue windows of the museum reflect the silhouette of the tall buildings, with [A Feng] standing motionless in front of the counter. From a distance, he looks as if he is enveloped by the pale blue windows.
1:31:33|1:31:37|He Jie gazed at the two amber stones for a long time, tears streaming down his face.
