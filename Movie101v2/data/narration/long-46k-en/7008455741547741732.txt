0:1:16|0:1:24|[Chen Jing]'s daughter [Chen Xiaoxin] in school uniform walks towards the restaurant. The mother and daughter sit at the table, with [Chen Jing] pouring milk for her daughter while talking.
0:1:28|0:1:35|After finishing breakfast, the daughter was about to leave. She took a few steps and then returned to grab a bag from the coffee table.
0:1:44|0:2:6|[Chen Jing]'s conversation with her daughter seeped into [Shi Hong]'s ears through the poorly soundproofed wall. After finishing washing up in the bathroom, he calmly dressed in front of the mirror. When the voices next door disappeared, [Shi Hong] chuckled softly, then opened the door and walked out. The old residential building was packed with people, with red bricks exposed and wrinkled walls covered in various small advertisements.
0:2:6|0:2:29|[Shi Hong] walked down the stairs of the residential building with a single-shoulder bag on his left shoulder, heading towards the sunlight. He left the sparsely populated alley and walked onto the main street, then descended the circular staircase on the overpass. Under the overpass, pedestrians were coming and going, with a few breakfast stalls parked on the side. [Shi Hong] walked forward expressionlessly, with his head down, while an old beggar with white hair sat on the steps by the roadside.
0:2:29|0:2:35|A man in a suit bends down and puts coins into the beggar's bowl.
0:2:37|0:2:51|The beggar thanked the man in a suit while moving his bowl towards [Shi Hong] who was approaching, but [Shi Hong] completely ignored him and walked away. On the other side under the bridge, two drifters were sitting by, sorting through garbage. Coming out from under the bridge, [Shi Hong] arrived at the Xinxin Snack Bar where [Chen Jing] was serving customers.
0:3:1|0:3:25|Chen Jing turned around to get the meal, Shi Hong took the bag and turned to leave, his gaze somewhat evasive. Chen Jing looked at Shi Hong's back thoughtfully. Shi Hong slowly walked towards Jiangbei Yucai Middle School with the fast food in hand, surrounded by students in school uniforms. He slightly hunched his back, stood facing the students on the platform, writing on the blackboard and reading aloud.
0:3:25|0:3:31|The students below were chattering non-stop and playing around, but no one paid any attention to them.
0:3:32|0:3:42|[Shi Hong] The classroom where [Chen Jing] teaches is noisy, while [Chen Xiaoxin], [Chen Jing]'s daughter, is currently in a music classroom at another school, leading her classmates in playing the oboe under the conductor's guidance.
0:3:46|0:4:5|Outside a snack shop, [Chen Jing] is receiving a delivery. She takes the delivery slip from the delivery guy, signs it with thanks, then picks up the goods on the ground and walks into the shop. Not far away, a man with medium-length hair stands on the steps, hands in his pockets, staring intently at [Chen Jing] moving the goods. As night falls, the whole residential building appears very quiet.
0:4:5|0:4:32|In the hallway, the incandescent light brought a small piece of brightness to the dark night. After work, [Shi Hong] was sitting by the desk lamp writing something. He flipped through the papers in his hand, and the table was covered with books. The blackboard next to him was filled with dense mathematical formulas. Next door, [Chen Jing] was ironing clothes at home. Just then, the man with medium-length hair who had been watching [Chen Jing] during the day arrived at [Chen Jing]'s doorstep, stood still, and rang the doorbell.
0:4:35|0:4:43|[Shi Hong] put down the pen and listened to the movement next door.
0:4:49|0:5:12|The man with medium-length hair kept ringing the doorbell without a word. [Chen Jing] hesitated for a moment inside the house, then raised her hand to open the door. On the other side, [Shi Hong] seemed lost in thought, looking down at the draft paper in his hand. The equations on the paper suddenly split into letters and symbols, scrambling around on the paper. The camera rapidly zoomed into the paper, and suddenly a blood-red X appeared in the center.
0:5:12|0:5:23|The title "The Devotion of Suspect X" appears on the screen. As the day breaks, Professor Tang Chuan, the senior consultant of the Provincial Public Security Department, is giving a lecture in the staircase classroom of the Jiangbei Police College.
0:5:46|0:6:0|The people listening to the lecture started whispering to each other. At this moment, two male assistants pushed two machines onto the stage. The machine on the left was full of small holes, while the machine on the right had a piece of glass on top. With a push of a switch by the assistants, the glass vibrated a few times and then shattered on the ground.
0:6:1|0:6:9|The audience in the class started to stir, [Tang Chuan] nodded to his assistant to move the two machines away, then pointed with his left hand at the screen and began to explain.
0:6:27|0:6:33|The animation on the screen begins to demonstrate the car crash process just described by [Tang Chuan].
0:6:49|0:6:55|The class ended, [Tang Chuan] walked out with his bag, and detective [Luo Miao] followed closely behind him.
0:7:43|0:8:6|[罗淼] glanced at his phone, handed the sandwich to him, then turned and ran. [Tang Chuan] picked up the sandwich, looked at it, smiled helplessly, and then left. The embankment under the bridge was crowded with people. Following their directions, a fence was seen erected along the riverbank. Two forensic doctors and several police officers were inside, with a naked body lying in the middle. Not far away, a bald man was being questioned by [Luo Miao].
0:8:39|0:8:49|The captain, accompanied by [Luo Miao] and another young detective, arrived at the body. [Dr. Niu] turned the body over, which was severely decomposed and unrecognizable. The young detective couldn't help but retch.
0:9:30|0:9:49|Captain Tang Chuan stood with his hands behind his back, contemplating the body on the ground for a few seconds before turning and walking away. Luo Miao watched the captain leave, then frowned as he looked back at the body. Not long after, he and several police officers, accompanied by a police dog, found a fallen bicycle under a bridge not far away.
0:11:0|0:11:17|[Luo Miao] picked up the file of [Chen Jing] and glanced at it. Then, accompanied by the young detective, they arrived at [Chen Jing]'s house. [Chen Jing] quickly opened the door, and [Luo Miao] showed his credentials before entering the house to look around. [Chen Jing] closed the door and turned around, asking,
0:11:53|0:12:4|[Chen Xiaoxin] walked out with her head down, poured a glass of water, then walked back without looking up. [Chen Jing] kept her eyes on her daughter, while [Luo Miao] glanced at [Chen Xiaoxin] before shifting her focus back to [Chen Jing].
0:12:43|0:13:4|Chen Jing put down her bag, took out a small booklet from the nearby bamboo basket, and walked over to Luo Miao. She handed the booklet to him. Luo Miao stood up, took the booklet, and found it to be a promotional booklet for a cartoon movie. He casually flipped through it, only to discover two movie tickets inside. Luo Miao glanced at the detective next to him, then bid farewell and left.
0:13:5|0:13:15|They were about to leave when they saw [Shi Hong] coming back from work. They saw him walking past with a slight hunch, head down and body slightly turned. [Luo Miao] and the detective next to her both stopped and turned to look at [Shi Hong].
0:13:46|0:14:5|As soon as the words fell, [Shi Hong] ignored the police officer next to him, turned around, opened the door, and walked into the room. [Luo Miao] and the police officer beside him had no choice but to leave. The light in the next room was dim, [Chen Jing] was wiping the table, and the two glasses of water that had been poured earlier were still there. Her expression was hidden under the messy hair, a bit unclear, but the whole person seemed to be burdened with heavy thoughts.
0:14:5|0:14:20|In the late night alley, with only a few passersby sporadically, [Shi Hong], who had just entered the house not long ago, came down from upstairs again. He walked to the public telephone, picked up the receiver with his left hand, inserted the phone card with his right hand, dialed a number, and it was unclear who he was calling.
0:14:20|0:14:37|The sun slowly rose, and [Tang Chuan] arrived at the Jiangbei Police Academy's Criminal Science and Technology Laboratory early in the morning with a handbag. After greeting the students, [Tang Chuan] walked into the laboratory and saw [Luo Miao] observing the ultrasonic generator on the table.
0:16:14|0:16:21|[Tang Chuan] operated the experimental equipment while talking to [Luo Miao]. After a moment of silence, [Luo Miao] suddenly walked towards a courier.
0:16:32|0:16:43|Upon hearing Luo Miao's words, Tang Chuan, with a coffee cup in hand, showed a surprised expression. His mind immediately went back to his childhood, with a young Tang Chuan and the rest of the students finishing the exam, tidying up their stationery, and getting ready to leave.
0:16:49|0:16:58|The invigilator teacher raised a test paper with a colored map on it in anger, the students looked at each other in dismay. Suddenly, the teacher pointed to the corner where a boy was writing something with his head down and scolded,
0:17:5|0:17:15|The young [Shi Hong] looked expressionless at the teacher, then lowered his head. Nearby, [Tang Chuan] smiled as he watched him. After class, [Tang Chuan] walked up to [Shi Hong] and said,
0:17:50|0:18:14|[Shi Hong] finished speaking and then lowered his head again. [Tang Chuan] took the notebook from [Shi Hong] and started reading, becoming more and more fascinated. With his right hand holding a pen in a writing position, [Shi Hong] glanced at the engrossed [Tang Chuan], his smile growing bigger. [Tang Chuan] also looked at him, and the two young men smiled at each other. The scene froze, then returned to reality. As an associate professor now, [Tang Chuan] waited alone at [Shi Hong]'s doorstep for him to return.
0:18:14|0:18:40|Not long after, [Shi Hong] saw his old friend coming down the stairs with a single-shoulder bag. He looked at him in front of the door, paused for a moment, and then led him into the house. [Shi Hong] reached out to turn on the light, which was dim and not very bright. [Tang Chuan] placed the bag on the table near the door, then turned to look at [Shi Hong], who was sorting books on the sofa with a smile on his face.
0:18:40|0:18:52|[Shi Hong] cleaned up the sofa, took off his jacket, and muttered to himself. He opened the refrigerator door covered with notes and found it empty. Then he closed the refrigerator door and said:
0:19:27|0:19:42|[Tang Chuan] raised his glass and clinked it with [Shi Hong], then spoke again. [Tang Chuan] nodded slightly.
0:19:57|0:20:7|The two exchanged a smile, as if they were back to their childhood days. The air seemed much less unfamiliar.
0:20:27|0:20:55|[Tang Chuan] kept staring at [Shi Hong]. [Shi Hong] blinked slightly when their eyes met, looking somewhat puzzled. [Tang Chuan] turned his head and took the briefcase, speaking while taking out a file folder from it. [Shi Hong] glanced at [Tang Chuan], then at the file folder in his hand, not sure what the other party meant. With soothing music playing, time flowed back to their student days. In an empty classroom, [Tang Chuan] played with a small toy to show [Shi Hong].
0:21:11|0:21:45|[Shi Hong] lowered his head in silence, while [Tang Chuan] had a confident look on his face. After hearing, [Shi Hong] raised his head to look at him, put down the pen in his hand, and walked to the platform without saying a word. He picked up a chalk and drew three rows of small dots on the blackboard, three dots in each row. While drawing, he spoke, "Shi Hong" finished drawing and turned to look at [Tang Chuan]. [Tang Chuan] smiled confidently, stood up from his desk, quickly walked to the blackboard, connected the nine dots with four continuous straight lines, then looked up at [Shi Hong].
0:21:48|0:22:5|Upon hearing Shi Hong's words, Tang Chuan put away his smile, turned around, and started writing questions on the blackboard. The scene darkened, and time returned to reality. Shi Hong opened a file bag and took out a not-so-thick book from it.
0:22:13|0:22:32|[Tang Chuan] raised an eyebrow as he spoke, while [Shi Hong] seemed to be lost in his book, turning silently to take out a piece of draft paper and a pen to start calculating. [Tang Chuan] watched [Shi Hong] with a slow smile, while on the other side, [Luo Miao] and the young detective arrived at the nightclub.
0:22:51|0:23:6|The landlady cursed [Chen Jing]'s ex-husband while smoking, and revealed everything she knew to the police. Early in the morning, [Tang Chuan] stood by the desk flipping through a notebook filled with formulas, while [Shi Hong] slowly got up from the desk and glanced at him.
0:23:58|0:24:19|[Tang Chuan] did not reply, but instead turned his head to look around at the surroundings. The two of them then left under the bridge and arrived at the entrance of the Xinxin Snack Bar. [Tang Chuan] glanced at the snack bar, then bid farewell and left.
0:24:20|0:24:26|[Shi Hong] watched the other person walk away, then turned and walked into the snack bar, as usual taking money out of his pocket and handing it to the front desk [Chen Jing].
0:24:32|0:24:39|[Shi Hong] left the snack shop with a takeout meal in hand, while not far away [Luo Miao] and a young detective were sitting in a car, taking notes in a notebook.
0:25:52|0:26:6|The young detective placed a map and a pen in front of [Chen Jing], waiting for her response. [Luo Miao] and the young detective then arrived at the area marked by [Chen Jing] to start their investigation.
0:26:6|0:26:14|A young detective walked into a hot dry noodle shop, while [Luo Miao] entered a clothing store. They looked around while showing their badges to the waiter.
0:26:20|0:26:27|They each showed a photo of [Chen Jing] to the waiter and received negative responses. Later, [Luo Miao] discovered a camera in the clothing store.
0:26:41|0:26:49|[Luo Miao] and the young detective returned to the police station, drawing a timeline while watching the surveillance footage.
0:26:54|0:27:11|The surveillance footage at 9:50 shows that [Chen Jing] was indeed looking at clothes with her daughter in the clothing store. [Luo Miao] frowned and leaned back, then went to the lab to ask for help from [Tang Chuan]. Upon seeing [Luo Miao], [Tang Chuan] gestured for the assistant to leave.
0:27:13|0:27:21|[Luo Miao] walked to the experimental equipment and handed a gun to [Tang Chuan]. [Tang Chuan] took the gun and walked to the recorder to start shooting the experiment.
0:27:24|0:27:29|After the first experiment, [Tang Chuan] and [Luo Miao] took off their noise-canceling headphones to change the equipment. While moving things around, [Luo Miao] turned around and asked,
0:27:38|0:27:45|[Tang Chuan] glanced at [Luo Miao], who stopped what he was doing and walked over to [Tang Chuan], saying,
0:27:51|0:28:4|[Tang Chuan] remained silent, putting on his headphones again to prepare for the second experiment. [Luo Miao] sighed and also put on his headphones. [Luo Miao] took off his headphones to work on the experimental equipment again, while [Tang Chuan] glanced at him sideways.
0:28:10|0:28:33|[Tang Chuan] lowered his head to adjust the instrument while speaking. After finishing, he put on his headphones again and walked to the instrument, preparing for the third experiment. [Luo Miao] glanced at him and also put on his headphones. After the experiment, [Tang Chuan] sat at the desk analyzing the results. [Luo Miao] walked over to him and said,
0:28:41|0:28:58|[Tang Chuan] had a serious expression on his face, and after speaking, he lowered his head to continue looking at the materials. [Luo Miao] stood in place, glanced at him, then turned and walked away. [Tang Chuan] remained in the same position, but his expression seemed thoughtful. The sun was shining outside, and [Tang Chuan] invited [Shi Hong] to go play badminton at the gym.
0:29:4|0:29:22|The two of them engaged in a fierce back-and-forth, with [Tang Chuan] launching strong attacks and [Shi Hong] running around the court to return the ball. Their breathing grew heavier with each exchange, and after several rounds, [Shi Hong] began to retreat step by step, eventually having to smile wryly and shake his head in defeat. After the workout, they both headed to the locker room to quickly freshen up.
0:29:22|0:29:49|[Shi Hong] took off his watch and placed it on the shelf, then stood aside to wash his hands. [Tang Chuan] walked over to the mirror and started fixing his hair. [Shi Hong] looked at him with a hint of envy. [Tang Chuan] smiled as he buttoned up his shirt and lowered his head. [Shi Hong] remained silent, turned around to pack his bag. [Tang Chuan] adjusted his collar and glanced at the watch on the shelf, casually picking it up.
0:29:51|0:30:4|[Shi Hong] hadn't even had a chance to speak when [Tang Chuan] took the watch away, leaving [Shi Hong] standing there in a daze for a while. [Tang Chuan] then returned to the lab and started experimenting with the equipment, when a student in a white lab coat walked in.
0:30:12|0:30:30|The student nodded, turned and walked out of the laboratory. [Tang Chuan] turned back to look at the data on the computer again, his expression becoming more and more serious, as if he had something on his mind. After a while, he stood up straight, took out his phone from his pocket, and walked to the side to make a call. The call was answered shortly after it was dialed.
0:30:36|0:30:59|Before long, [Tang Chuan] received the criminal investigation file of the murder and disposal of the body on the riverbank in Jiangbei City Public Security Bureau. Various photos and information were spread out on the table. He carefully analyzed the suspect's profile and wrote a report, stating that antisocial personality disorder is more accurate than borderline personality disorder. The two are very similar, and the report also listed various related behaviors, such as those beyond oneself.
0:30:59|0:31:24|When faced with extreme indifference, he placed the report, physical evidence from the crime scene, and photos of the victim together for contemplation. Suddenly, the image of [Shi Hong] wielding a hammer and committing murder on the embankment flashed through his mind. [Tang Chuan] leaned back in his chair with relevant documents, closed his eyes with a serious expression, let out a heavy sigh, threw the documents onto the table, and [Luo Miao], who had been waiting in the corner for a while, slowly sat up straight.
0:31:32|0:31:39|[Tang Chuan] remained in the same position as before, his expression very serious. After a long silence, he finally spoke,
0:32:7|0:32:22|[Tang Chuan] stood up from the chair, and [Luo Miao] continued his words.
0:32:59|0:33:6|[Tang Chuan]’s expression became increasingly serious. Under the cover of the night, the residential building was reflected in the puddle by the roadside, appearing particularly desolate.
0:33:7|0:33:39|At this moment, [Chen Jing] is packing clothes at home. Suddenly, she seems to hear something, then she stops holding the clothes and stands still. After a moment of contemplation, she slowly turns her head to look outside the window. Time quickly goes back to the day when the film started. A man with medium-length hair, who is [Chen Jing]'s ex-husband [Fu Jian], keeps ringing the doorbell outside. The door of [Chen Jing]'s house is frosted glass, with no peephole to see the outside situation. After hesitating for a moment, she opens the door, only to find her ex-husband [Fu Jian] outside. Seeing this, [Chen Jing] desperately tries to close the door.
0:33:39|0:33:49|Unable to match the strength of the two, [Fu Jian] exerted force and pushed [Chen Jing] backwards, causing her to fall to the ground at the edge of the table. [Fu Jian] took the opportunity to sneak into the room.
0:34:15|0:34:21|[Chen Jing] is arguing with [Fu Jian], when suddenly their daughter [Chen Xiaoxin] pushes the door open and enters. [Chen Jing] quickly walks over to protect her.
0:34:42|0:34:48|Fu Jian pushed Chen Jing down and then desperately went to knock on Chen Xiaoxin's door.
0:35:25|0:35:41|[Fu Jian] was unfastening his belt while leaning over [Chen Jing] and kissing her wildly. [Chen Jing] struggled desperately but couldn't break free. [Chen Xiaoxin] couldn't sit still anymore. She looked around, picked up a trophy, and rushed out of the bedroom, hitting [Fu Jian] on the head with it. [Fu Jian] was instantly stunned.
0:35:42|0:35:52|[Chen Jing] quickly got up and hugged her daughter to comfort her. [Chen Jing] struggled to stand up, pushed [Chen Jing] to the ground, grabbed [Chen Xiaoxin] by the hair and pushed her down, starting to beat her up.
0:36:8|0:36:17|[Chen Jing] stood in the middle of the living room in a daze, looking around. Then she grabbed the iron cord and looped it around [Fu Jian]'s neck from behind, pulling it back forcefully.
0:36:17|0:36:30|[Fu Jian] fell backwards in a moment of carelessness, his head lying on the coffee table, his neck against the edge of the table, desperately reaching out to pull the power cord, trying to resist, his face showing a very painful and ferocious expression. [Chen Jing] fell too heavily on the other side of the coffee table, her hands still...
0:36:30|0:36:41|Tang Chuan held onto the wire tightly, while Chen Xiaoxin quickly got up beside him, biting Fu Jian's hand to stop him from struggling. Chen Jing gritted her teeth and continued to pull the rope with all her strength, while Fu Jian's legs flailed around less and less as he struggled.
0:36:41|0:37:0|During the confrontation, a small clock fell from the coffee table, with its plastic casing landing aside. The hands were still turning regularly. Every sound in the room was clearly heard by Shi Hong next door. He stopped what he was doing and listened carefully to the movements in Chen Jing's house. After a while, Luo Miao stared with wide eyes, mouth slightly open, completely unresponsive.
0:37:0|0:37:7|Chen Xiaoxin, with disheveled hair, knelt to the side panting heavily. As she looked up, she was startled by Tang Chuan's appearance and took a step back, collapsing on the ground.
0:37:7|0:37:24|[Chen Jing] regained consciousness, looked down at the already dead [Fu Jian], and was so scared that she let go of the wire in her hand. [Fu Jian]'s body slid off the coffee table, [Chen Jing]'s face was full of horror. [Chen Xiaoxin] knelt and crawled to her mother's side, and the mother and daughter hugged tightly, trembling and gasping for breath.
0:37:32|0:37:39|[Chen Jing] and her daughter were startled by the doorbell, and they both turned abruptly to look towards the front door.
0:37:42|0:38:8|Chen Jing immediately pulled her daughter up from the ground and pushed her into the house, then picked up the cloth on the sofa to cover Fu Jian's body. She got up in a panic, breathing heavily, while tidying her hair and clothes. After a moment, she adjusted her emotions, walked to the door and stopped, asking in a steady voice. Chen Jing seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, hesitated for a moment, and then reached out to open the door.
0:38:9|0:38:18|She opened the door a crack, only to see [Shi Hong] standing outside saying to her,
0:38:26|0:38:35|[Chen Jing] finally breathed a sigh of relief, then lowered her head and spoke slowly.
0:38:37|0:38:58|[Chen Jing] stood in the room, [Shi Hong] stood outside the door, the two of them faced each other in silence. After a moment, [Shi Hong] nodded at [Chen Jing]. She glanced at him, slowly closed the door. As soon as the door closed, [Chen Jing] immediately slumped against it, saying she needed to get her phone. Suddenly, her daughter rushed out to stop her.
0:39:13|0:39:21|The mother and daughter were startled by the doorbell again. [Chen Jing] opened the door slightly, only to see [Shi Hong] standing expressionless outside the door, speaking in a very cold tone,
0:39:43|0:39:58|[Chen Jing] kept her head down and remained silent. [Shi Hong] then walked into the room, closed the door behind him, glanced at the position of the body, took out a pair of black gloves from his pocket, put them on, squatted beside the coffee table, and lifted the cloth covering the body.
0:40:31|0:40:40|[Shi Hong] turned to look at the mother and daughter behind him, [Chen Jing] and her daughter's faces were filled with helplessness.
0:41:2|0:41:32|[Shi Hong] stopped his movements, turned his head to look at [Chen Jing] with a cold expression but determination in his eyes. The scene shifted, back to the present, with [Chen Jing] standing by the table lost in thought. She then opened a drawer, neatly placing the folded clothes into the wardrobe. On the other side, [Shi Hong] walked to the public telephone outside the residential building, glanced around, and finally made the call.
0:41:32|0:41:40|Chen Jing's home phone rang, she turned and took a few steps, picked up the phone, and it was Shi Hong on the other end.
0:42:0|0:42:14|[Shi Hong] paused for a moment, nodded, and there was suddenly silence on the phone, with neither of them speaking. Upstairs, [Chen Jing] was losing control of her emotions, her eyes turning red as she spoke.
0:42:31|0:42:40|[Chen Jing] couldn't help but cry, tears streaming down her face.
0:42:48|0:43:9|She wiped away tears while choking up, then hung up the phone. [Shi Hong] listened to the crying and the sound of the phone being hung up coming from the receiver, and was stunned for a moment. He raised his hand to put the receiver back in place, staring blankly at the public phone on the wall. His expression was hesitant, as if contemplating something.
0:43:9|0:43:22|The next day, Tang Chuan arrived at the crime scene by the embankment and looked around. Luo Miao walked towards him and started speaking.
0:43:24|0:43:30|He pointed behind him and then pointed in front of him.
0:44:57|0:45:17|After he finished speaking, he continued to walk forward. Behind him, [Luo Miao] and the young detective exchanged a glance and then lifted their legs to catch up with him. Pedestrians were coming and going on the main street in the city center. [Chen Jing] took her daughter [Chen Xiaoxin] to the supermarket to buy things. [Chen Jing] pushed the cart, which already had many daily necessities inside. [Chen Xiaoxin] reached out and took a bottle of sauce and put it in the cart. The mother and daughter walked and browsed at the same time.
0:45:17|0:45:44|Unexpectedly, [Shi Hong] ran into [Chen Xiaoxin] at the corner, [Chen Xiaoxin] looked a bit out of control. [Chen Jing] quickly turned around to comfort her daughter. Seeing this, [Shi Hong] also appeared somewhat unnatural. He turned around, looked at the fruit stall, picked up an orange and smelled it. [Chen Jing] pushed the cart over to [Shi Hong], only to see him putting one orange after another into the bag. [Chen Jing] stared at him for a while, then moved the cart aside and slowly walked over to him.
0:45:44|0:45:52|Picking up the orange gently, [Tang Chuan] lowered his head and said to him,
0:45:55|0:46:26|[Chen Jing] handed the orange in her hand to [Shi Hong]. [Shi Hong] slowly reached out his hand to take the orange from [Chen Jing], hesitated for a moment, then put the orange into the bag. As [Chen Jing] picked oranges and asked a question, [Shi Hong] kept his head down. He remained silent for a while, just about to answer when their conversation was interrupted by passersby. After the passerby finished shopping, they left. [Chen Jing] and [Shi Hong] stood still. [Chen Jing] looked up at him, then picked up another orange and handed it to him again.
0:46:26|0:46:35|[Shi Hong] still didn't dare to look up, silently took the orange, and finally spoke to her,
0:46:40|0:46:47|He said these words, then lowered his eyes, bowed his head, picked up a bag of oranges at hand, and turned to the left to leave.
0:46:47|0:47:13|[Chen Jing] stood there, holding an orange in his hand and slowly turning his head. He watched as [Shi Hong] gradually walked away, as if pondering something. His face revealed a hint of gratitude, mixed with complexity. Another day passed, [Shi Hong] put on a new jacket and, as usual, carried a single-shoulder bag. He walked alone into the Xinxin Snack Bar. As he approached the counter, he saw [Chen Jing] smiling at him. While he spoke, she interrupted and said,
0:47:14|0:47:26|[Shi Hong] nodded slowly, and [Chen Jing] smiled as she bent down to retrieve a pre-packaged white bag from under the counter and handed it to him. He looked up at [Chen Jing] somewhat dazed, quickly lowered his head to accept the bag and thanked her.
0:47:27|0:47:32|[Shi Hong] took the bag and turned to leave, while [Chen Jing] gazed at his back for a long time without coming back to her senses.
0:47:32|0:47:51|During lunchtime, all the teachers went out to eat, leaving [Shi Hong] alone in the office. [Shi Hong] sat in front of the computer, picked up a white takeout bag from the side, took out the meal and placed it on the desk. As he was about to put the bag down, he found a note inside that read: "Eat on time, take care of your health, thank you for everything you've done for us."
0:47:51|0:48:12|[Shi Hong] looked at the note in his hand, a smile appearing on his face. As night fell, [Shi Hong] carried a box of trash outside. Carefully supporting the box, [Shi Hong] slowly walked to the garbage station. A nearby resident had just finished throwing away trash and was walking out. [Shi Hong] carefully avoided him, walked to the trash can, lifted the lid, and threw the box in.
0:48:12|0:48:22|Coincidentally, [Chen Xiaoxin] also came to dump the garbage at this time. When she saw [Shi Hong], she wanted to hide, but still walked up to him and called out to him.
0:48:23|0:48:30|[Shi Hong] glanced at her and quickly looked away. [Chen Xiaoxin] walked up to him, throwing away trash as she spoke.
0:48:49|0:49:25|[Shi Hong] looked up at her, with a comforting look in his eyes. [Chen Xiaoxin] turned around to go home, then quickly turned back and said something. [Shi Hong] looked at [Chen Xiaoxin] with surprise, nodded at her, and the two stood by the trash can, looking at each other and smiling. Afterwards, [Chen Xiaoxin] turned around and went home, while [Shi Hong] watched her leave and then lowered his head again.
0:49:26|0:49:49|[Chen Xiaoxin] returned home and stayed alone in her bedroom practicing the double reed instrument. [Shi Hong] sat at the desk, grading papers, while enjoying the music coming from next door, with a look of pure enjoyment on his face.
0:49:57|0:50:13|In the laboratory, [Tang Chuan] picked up [Shi Hong]'s watch thoughtfully. Outside, [Luo Miao] and a young detective sat in the car keeping watch. In the Xinxin Snack Bar, [Chen Jing] was cleaning. A man in a suit walked in carrying a briefcase, and [Chen Jing] looked surprised when she saw him.
0:50:15|0:50:30|Kun Ge walked towards [Chen Jing] with a smile on his face, stood in front of her without saying a word for a long time, then the scene switched back to inside the residential building. [Chen Xiaoxin] was still practicing the double reed diligently, [Shi Hong] got up from the desk and walked to the wall, gently tapping a few times.
0:50:32|0:50:47|[Chen Xiaoxin] listened to the tapping sound while searching Morse code online. After translating it, all the tapping sounds formed a word, "beautiful." It turned out that [Shi Hong] was praising her for playing the flute so well. A happy smile appeared on [Chen Xiaoxin]'s face. Then the scene shifted to the restaurant.
0:52:2|0:52:12|Kun Ge picked up the chopsticks and picked up a shrimp for [Chen Jing]. [Chen Jing] smiled and was about to eat, when suddenly it started to rain heavily outside. [Chen Jing] turned her head to look out the window, seeming a bit worried.
0:52:15|0:52:39|The rain grew heavier, [Chen Jing] sat in Kun Ge's car and spoke to him. [Chen Jing] glanced at Kun Ge, then turned her head away. The two remained silent, the sound of thunder rumbled. [Chen Jing] secretly hung up the phone. Downstairs in the residential building, [Shi Hong] stood in front of the public phone, staring blankly as he put down the receiver.
0:52:42|0:52:56|The rain was getting heavier. Without reaching anyone on the phone, [Shi Hong] glanced back and quietly opened his umbrella, ready to go home. There were only a few pedestrians passing by on the rain-soaked street. [Shi Hong] had just entered the entrance of the building, folding up his umbrella and preparing to go upstairs.
0:52:56|0:53:28|Not far away, a car drove over. Kun Ge parked the car in front of the residential building, opened the umbrella and went to open the door for [Chen Jing]. [Chen Jing] got out of the passenger seat with one hand holding the bag on her shoulder. Kun Ge handed the umbrella to [Chen Jing] while talking, then quickly handed it to her and ran to the driver's seat. In the blink of an eye, he drove the car away. [Chen Jing] stood in place watching him leave, then looked up to see [Shi Hong] watching her from upstairs.
0:53:28|0:53:35|She suddenly stood there, unsure of how to react. [Shi Hong] looked at her for a moment, then left the railing and walked back towards home.
0:53:35|0:54:15|Chen Jing looked somewhat at a loss as she watched Shi Hong's back. Not far away, Luo Miao and the young detective were sitting in the car, observing everything that was happening at the moment. Chen Jing stood in the rain holding an umbrella, motionless for a long time. Shi Hong quickly walked into the house and closed the door. He bent over in front of the door, panting heavily. Suddenly, his body went limp and he collapsed against the wall as if he had been shocked by something. The umbrella was leaning to the side next to him, with rain continuously dripping onto the ground.
0:54:15|0:54:28|He slowly got up and walked to the desk by the window, sitting down on the chair weakly. He looked very dispirited. He lowered his head as if contemplating something or writing something, while the pouring rain continued outside.
0:54:28|0:54:44|Next door, [Chen Jing] returned home to change out of her rain-soaked clothes. She tied up her hair and put on some home clothes. The living room was dimly lit, with only a floor lamp emitting a dim yellow light. She sat at the dining table, cutting fruits while watching TV, her expression revealing a sense of distraction.
0:54:44|0:55:2|Daughter [Chen Xiaoxin] was sitting on the sofa hugging a pillow, completely unaware of her mother's unusual behavior. As the night quietly passed, the next morning, [Chen Jing] arrived alone at a men's clothing store. She picked out a jacket, and as the store clerk folded the clothes, they chatted with her.
0:55:7|0:55:20|The salesperson placed the neatly folded coat on the counter, bent down to grab a shopping bag. [Chen Jing] caressed the coat in front of her, a smile gradually appearing on her face. The scene darkened, [Tang Chuan] stood outside the gate of Jiangbei Yucai Primary School waiting for [Shi Hong] to finish class.
0:55:24|0:55:39|The bell rings, [Shi Hong] walks out with the crowd and sees [Tang Chuan] as soon as he reaches the school gate. [Tang Chuan] leans against the wall at the entrance and turns his head to look at him, saying,
0:55:42|0:55:46|[Shi Hong] shook his head and then lifted his chin, pointing forward to signal him to catch up.
0:55:46|0:56:12|Chen Jing walked into the Xinxin Snack Bar with Shi Hong following behind. Upon seeing Shi Hong, Chen Jing bent down to pick up a clothing bag under the counter. Shi Hong hurriedly spoke up to stop her. Chen Jing paused for a moment, then put the clothing bag back in place. She glanced at Shi Hong, then at Tang Chuan, creating a somewhat awkward atmosphere. Shi Hong turned his head to look at Tang Chuan. Tang Chuan smiled and said something, and Chen Jing forced a smile in response.
0:56:25|0:56:33|[Tang Chuan] picked up his phone and glanced at it before stepping aside to answer the call.
0:56:47|0:56:56|Chen Jing refused Kun Ge verbally, while handing the ticket to Shi Hong. Tang Chuan, who was next to them, answered the phone and observed Shi Hong's reaction in the mirror on the wall.
0:56:58|0:57:16|Chen Jing handed the packed bag to Shi Hong and Kun Ge continued to chat with Chen Jing with a smile. Shi Hong took the bag and walked away, Tang Chuan glanced at Chen Jing and followed him out. After leaving the snack shop, he said to Shi Hong,
0:57:32|0:57:56|After a few seconds of eye contact between [Tang Chuan] and [Shi Hong], they walked forward. [Shi Hong] stood still for a moment, then lifted his leg and caught up. They arrived at the office together. After dinner, [Tang Chuan] stood by the sink, bowing his head to make coffee. Occasionally, he looked up at [Shi Hong], who was cleaning up the leftover trash from the meal. As he cleaned, he glanced at a mechanical diagram drawn on the blackboard next to him.
0:57:56|0:58:0|Then Tang Chuan walked towards the trash can with the garbage in hand and threw the takeout box into it.
0:58:17|0:58:31|[Shi Hong] refused the coffee offered by [Tang Chuan], took out a tissue and started wiping the table. As he wiped, he asked a question. [Tang Chuan] glanced at him after hearing the question.
0:58:47|0:58:58|[Shi Hong] came to the rack to observe the instruments on top. [Tang Chuan] walked up behind him and asked. [Shi Hong] glanced at him and calmly replied.
0:59:51|1:0:5|[Shi Hong] nodded to [Tang Chuan], then prepared to leave. [Tang Chuan] put his hands in his pockets and walked to the door to see [Shi Hong] off. The two walked through the long corridor, one in front and one behind, in silence. When they reached the corner of the stairs, [Tang Chuan] suddenly spoke,
1:0:28|1:0:52|After Shi Hong finished speaking, Tang Chuan turned and left alone. Tang Chuan stood on the steps, watching Shi Hong's back with a serious expression. In the classroom, a student intentionally threw a large paper ball at Shi Hong's back. Shi Hong put down the chalk and slowly turned around.
1:0:55|1:1:2|Shi Hong's voice was very stern. Outside the classroom, Luo Miao and the young detective happened to pass by, only to see Shi Hong shouting at a student.
1:1:12|1:1:18|After class, [Luo Miao] walked into the office and placed an attendance book in front of [Shi Hong], asking,
1:1:43|1:1:50|[Luo Miao] put away the attendance book, and a detective next to him pushed a notebook and a pen in front of [Shi Hong]. [Shi Hong] looked up at the two of them.
1:2:38|1:2:58|After finishing speaking, [Luo Miao] opened the door and sat in the driver's seat, while the young detective opened the door and sat in the passenger seat. They drove away together. As the sky darkened, [Shi Hong] parked a black car by the roadside. His eyes kept scanning outside, as if observing something or waiting for someone to appear. Suddenly, [Shi Hong] raised his heavy camera and started taking pictures outside.
1:2:58|1:3:18|Following the direction of the camera, we see Tang Chuan walking out of a building. He is dressed in a shirt and suit as usual, carrying a leather bag in his right hand. He walks towards the outside, raising his left hand with a watch on to check the time. Completely unaware that someone is secretly filming him, he walks from the street into the indoor parking lot, then drives off towards his destination.
1:3:18|1:3:41|[Shi Hong] stepped on the gas and turned the steering wheel. Following closely behind, through the rearview mirror in front of the car, you could see the emotionless eyes of [Shi Hong]. He drove along with Kun Ge through several streets. Kun Ge made a right turn and parked the car in a parking space by the roadside. Seeing this, [Shi Hong], who was following behind, promptly parked the car in an empty space not far away. He watched Kun Ge get out of the car, raised his hand to lock the car door with the key.
1:3:41|1:4:6|Then he walked into the nearby restaurant, [Shi Hong] sat in the car and took out his camera again to secretly take photos. From the lens, we can see [Chen Jing] suddenly appearing behind Kun Ge. [Shi Hong]'s hand hesitated for a moment, he put down the camera and looked at the restaurant for a while, then raised the camera again. With the guidance of the restaurant waiter, [Chen Jing] followed Kun Ge and sat in the empty seat next to the floor-to-ceiling glass. Through the glass window, [Shi Hong] could clearly see their every move.
1:4:6|1:4:15|He saw [Chen Jing] placing her bag on the right side, while Kun Ge across the table was flipping through the menu and talking to [Chen Jing] with great enthusiasm.
1:4:30|1:4:38|[Chen Jing] smiled slightly, without giving a reply to Kun Ge. [Shi Hong], who was squatting outside the restaurant, then returned home alone. He looked through photos while writing something.
1:4:55|1:5:6|[Shi Hong] puts the printed photos and letter into [Chen Jing]'s mailbox. When [Chen Jing] sees it, she explodes in anger, pounding the living room wall and then throwing the clothes she bought for [Shi Hong] into the trash can.
1:5:9|1:5:17|The next day, [Shi Hong] followed Kun Ge to the place where they discussed business. He glanced at Kun Ge, then ducked into a phone booth and made a call.
1:5:27|1:5:48|[Shi Hong] hung up the phone directly. Ambulances and police cars were dispatched at the same time, heading towards the location mentioned by [Shi Hong]. On the other side, Kun Ge, who had just finished his business, walked into the parking lot. He was about to get into his car when he was attacked by a man with a stick. He quickly dodged, and shortly after, the police car arrived. The man was taken back to the police station by the police.
1:6:14|1:6:26|[Luo Miao] took out a few photos and placed them in front of [Chen Jing], which were exactly the ones secretly taken by [Shi Hong]. [Chen Jing] hesitated for a moment before speaking, causing [Luo Miao] to look up and shake her head towards [Tang Chuan] not far away. A look of helplessness appeared on [Tang Chuan]'s face as well.
1:6:43|1:6:58|[Luo Miao] angrily pounded the table, while a room full of police officers sat in the office not knowing what to do. Just then, a notification sounded from [Tang Chuan]'s phone. He took out his phone and saw that it was a message from [Shi Hong], asking if he wanted to go mountain climbing together tomorrow.
1:6:58|1:7:19|Early the next morning, a bus drove along a road through the woods and stopped by a sign. [Tang Chuan] got off the bus with a backpack and saw [Shi Hong] standing by the roadside in mountaineering gear, hands in pockets, next to a large mountaineering bag. Clearly, [Shi Hong] had been waiting for a while. When [Tang Chuan] walked up to him, [Shi Hong] took his hands out of his pockets.
1:7:19|1:7:28|Bending down to pick up the backpack next to him and putting it on his back, [Tang Chuan] looked at him and said,
1:7:31|1:7:40|[Shi Hong] replied while packing his bag, fastened the bag to his chest and walked towards the mountain. [Tang Chuan] stood still for a few seconds before following.
1:7:40|1:7:51|Two people walked in the woods, one in front and one behind. The woods were filled with fog, no sun, the ground was damp, covered with dry branches, rotten leaves, and weeds. [Shi Hong] walked in the front, not looking back, and said,
1:7:59|1:8:10|[Tang Chuan] did not respond to his words, but followed his footsteps into the depths of the forest. The path became increasingly difficult, with tree branches extending everywhere, posing a risk of getting scratched if one wasn't careful.
1:8:10|1:8:29|[Tang Chuan] took each step very carefully and with great difficulty, while [Shi Hong] seemed to be back in his comfort zone. He easily jumped on the almost flat slope, stepped on the stones in the middle of the stream as if walking on flat ground, and effortlessly reached the other side. Meanwhile, [Tang Chuan] almost stumbled downhill, with one foot stepping into the water every two steps, struggling even to stay steady.
1:8:29|1:8:35|[Shi Hong] climbed over a steep slope, glanced back at the disheveled [Tang Chuan], then turned back and continued walking forward.
1:8:35|1:9:5|[Tang Chuan] tried to steady his steps, wading through the water to the other side and continuing to follow. After walking for a long time, they stopped next to a huge fallen tree. [Shi Hong] placed his backpack to the side and gestured for [Tang Chuan] to wait here. [Tang Chuan] lifted his leg over the fallen tree, adjusted his clothes, and sat down. He glanced at the backpack left by [Shi Hong] and saw a thick bundle of rope sticking out from the side. It seemed like he realized something. Meanwhile, not far away, [Shi Hong] walked uphill and entered a small wooden house.
1:9:5|1:9:18|Opening the door, [Shi Hong] takes an axe from the table by the door and walks towards [Tang Chuan]. Seeing [Shi Hong] approaching with the axe, [Tang Chuan] is so scared that he stands up from the dead wood directly, nervously watching [Shi Hong] getting closer and closer, unsure of how to react.
1:9:18|1:9:51|Shi Hong's face still showed no expression, he calmly walked up to Tang Chuan and said, "Shi Hong took a small step forward, tossed the axe up and handed it to Tang Chuan. Tang Chuan glanced at a stack of firewood next to the small cabin, then breathed a sigh of relief. He took the axe from Shi Hong and started a fire by the stream. Tang Chuan sat down and spoke:
1:9:58|1:10:7|[Shi Hong] finished speaking and then turned his body in another direction. Beside him, [Tang Chuan] turned his head to look at him.
1:10:59|1:11:7|[Shi Hong] recalled the past while sitting alone at home, with the blackboard covered in formulas.
1:11:16|1:11:33|He wrote and erased on the blackboard repeatedly, sitting at the desk calculating desperately. He spread out sheets of parchment, filled them with writing, then crumpled them up and threw them into the wastebasket on the floor. He repeated this action over and over again.
1:11:33|1:11:47|Next to the trash can was already filled with drafts, he lay on the table gasping for breath in despair, as if the whole person had already sunk into a breakdown. He brought over a stool and slowly stepped on it, pulling down the rope hanging from the beam, preparing to hang himself.
1:11:47|1:12:7|However, as he hesitated when putting his neck into the rope, [Shi Hong] seemed to fall back into the despair he had experienced before, unable to extricate himself for a long time. He stared blankly at the stream in front of him, where a whole dried leaf floated on the water, accompanying the flow of the stream, then hitting a nearby rock and spinning in circles endlessly.
1:12:15|1:12:25|[Shi Hong] let out a soft sigh, then smiled bitterly and said:
1:12:30|1:12:57|[Shi Hong] stared into [Tang Chuan]'s eyes as if making a decision. After a moment, [Shi Hong] suddenly looked away, glanced at the fire beside him, then turned and bent down to pick up a container for the soup. [Tang Chuan] watched his movements, then looked around with a sigh before speaking,
1:13:3|1:13:10|[Shi Hong] handed the container of hot soup to [Tang Chuan], who took it, blew on it gently, and then took a sip.
1:13:42|1:13:58|[Tang Chuan] stared at [Shi Hong]'s eyes while speaking, but [Shi Hong] did not look away. They locked eyes with each other. After a couple of dried leaves spun around in the stream and drifted away, [Shi Hong] spoke up.
1:14:10|1:14:32|[Shi Hong] fell silent after speaking, and [Tang Chuan] didn't say anything either. The two of them quietly gazed at the scenery in front of them without speaking. Meanwhile, [Chen Jing] was in the living room tidying up the dining table, while [Chen Xiaoxin] was getting ready to leave with a backpack on her back. The band was going to participate in a competition today. [Chen Jing] didn't respond, she picked up the plates to wash them, but was startled by a figure outside the window as soon as she reached it.
1:14:33|1:14:47|[Chen Jing] suddenly walked to her daughter and reminded her: [Chen Jing] touched her daughter's hair, opened the door and watched her daughter leave. After she herself was ready, she went to the Xinxin Snack Bar.
1:14:49|1:14:55|Chen Jing stood behind the counter watching a mother and daughter eating in the restaurant.
1:14:58|1:15:24|[Chen Jing] was startled by the voice of [Shi Hong] as soon as she answered the phone. Sitting in the driver's seat of the car, [Shi Hong] slowly took the phone from beside his ear with a cold and indifferent expression. After hanging up the phone, [Chen Jing] ran home, sprinting to the mailbox to retrieve a letter. Inside was a white paper with the words: "You ruined everything for me, now I will take everything from you." Under the white paper were several photos of [Chen Xiaoxin] taken secretly.
1:15:24|1:15:33|[Chen Jing] instantly broke down emotionally, trembling as she took out her phone from her bag. She cried while dialing a number.
1:15:42|1:15:48|She leaned weakly against the railing with one hand, squatting on the ground for help. [Luo Miao] received a call and then ran outside with the young detective.
1:15:53|1:16:19|Two people quickly got into the car and drove towards their destination. On the other side, [Tang Chuan] walked into the laboratory as usual, carrying his briefcase. He reached the door, took out his keys to open it, only to find it already open. [Tang Chuan] briskly entered the laboratory, but found it empty. As he walked to the table and just set down his bag and keys, he sensed something was wrong. The directional sound wave generator in the lab was missing, while at that moment, in the car, [Shi Hong] sat next to the driver's seat with the lost device.
1:16:19|1:16:35|[Shi Hong] started the car and drove off, pressing the accelerator hard and turning the steering wheel to move forward. His expressionless face still, but with a hint of madness. In the laboratory, [Tang Chuan] was running out while calling [Luo Miao].
1:16:55|1:17:4|[Tang Chuan] was on the phone with [Luo Miao] while running towards the office building. He quickly got into the car, stepped on the gas pedal, and started speeding down the narrow road, completely ignoring the issue of speeding.
1:17:4|1:17:15|He even drove against the traffic on a one-way street to take a shortcut, narrowly avoiding a collision with another car. The scene then shifted to the other side of the road, where the school bus of Jiangbei Experimental First Middle School was moving forward on the street.
1:17:18|1:17:35|Students were singing under the guidance of the teacher, but [Chen Xiaoxin] in the back row by the window was looking outside without saying a word. Meanwhile, [Luo Miao] who was running wildly and the young detective were blocked at the intersection.
1:17:44|1:18:3|The teacher stood in the middle of the car, but his phone was placed in the clothes on the seat, so he naturally couldn't hear the phone vibrating. [Luo Miao] was a little anxious and turned to drive towards the side road. [Tang Chuan] was also desperately accelerating to catch up, but [Shi Hong], who caused all this panic, was driving calmly without any hurry.
1:18:3|1:18:29|After a long chase, the young detective Tang Chuan finally spotted the school bus of Jiangbei Experimental First Middle School at a bend. He quickly pointed it out to Luo Miao, who saw the bus and immediately sounded the siren, speeding up towards the bus. By this time, the bus had already entered the elevated bridge. Luo Miao followed closely in his car, about to catch up.
1:18:33|1:18:54|[Luo Miao] chased after the car while honking at the driver to stop. Inside the car, the students also heard the commotion outside and looked out simultaneously. The driver glanced down as [Luo Miao] and the young detective pointed ahead, signaling him to stop. Several other police cars caught up and surrounded the bus. The young detective handed the phone to [Chen Xiaoxin], asking her to.
1:18:54|1:19:1|She reported her safety to [Chen Jing], and [Chen Xiaoxin] returned the phone to the young detective.
1:19:32|1:19:54|[Luo Miao] finished speaking and ran off. The young detective followed him towards the car, while [Tang Chuan] continued to drive frantically. As they passed the section of road where the bus had previously traveled, [Shi Hong], who had been waiting on the side, also caught up. [Luo Miao] returned to the car and drove in the direction from which they had just come. He steered with his left hand, picked up his phone with his right hand, paying attention to traffic while calling [Tang Chuan].
1:19:54|1:20:2|However, despite calling many times, nobody answered. [Luo Miao] was getting anxious, but [Tang Chuan] was focused on driving and completely ignored the vibrating phone.
1:20:8|1:20:24|Luo Miao could only sit in the car anxiously, speeding towards Tang Chuan. However, Tang Chuan himself was completely unaware of the impending danger, as Shi Hong behind him slowly began to accelerate, preparing to overtake, gradually driving parallel to Tang Chuan's car.
1:20:24|1:20:45|At the critical moment, Tang Chuan, who was focused on driving, finally answered Luo Miao's phone call. As Tang Chuan turned his head, he saw the directional sound wave generator heading towards him. The device was activated by Shi Hong, causing Tang Chuan's head to start throbbing. He was no longer able to control the steering wheel.
1:21:6|1:21:35|He parked the car on the side and ran towards [Tang Chuan]. The scene darkened gradually. A few days later, [Tang Chuan] sat alone on a bench outside the hospital ward, lost in thought. He had a neck brace on and his right hand rested on the back of the bench, staring straight ahead, lost in his own thoughts. Soon, [Luo Miao] walked over and sat beside [Tang Chuan], looking at the hospital scenery and started talking to him.
1:21:46|1:21:53|[Tang Chuan] stood up straight after hearing it, glanced sideways at [Luo Miao], rolled his eyes at him, and then asked:
1:23:7|1:23:12|[Tang Chuan] said nothing, as if still in a daze, pondering something.
1:23:19|1:23:46|[Chen Jing]’s family TV was showing the scene of [Shi Hong] being arrested. [Chen Xiaoxin] raised the remote control to turn off the TV and asked, [Chen Xiaoxin] walked behind her mother, with a serious expression on her young face.
1:23:46|1:23:57|[Chen Jing] did not speak after hearing her daughter's words. Instead, she slowly turned around to look at her daughter, then embraced her tightly, tears in her eyes, without saying a word.
1:23:57|1:24:16|The next day, [Tang Chuan] was alone in the laboratory, sorting through documents at his desk. Suddenly, [Luo Miao] walked in, with his hands in his pockets, silently watching the busy [Tang Chuan]. He seemed a bit sullen. [Tang Chuan] glanced at him, continued packing up, and asked,
1:24:31|1:24:39|[Luo Miao] handed a stack of documents to [Tang Chuan], who set them aside.
1:24:49|1:25:9|[Tang Chuan] pondered for a moment, then nodded and said. He turned around and drew nine dots in a 3x3 grid on the blackboard. [Luo Miao] looked at the nine dots, crossing his hands as if puzzled.
1:25:30|1:25:36|[Tang Chuan] recalled what [Shi Hong] had said, and a series of case files he had seen flashed through his mind.
1:26:10|1:26:26|[Tang Chuan] leaned forward, hands on the desk, eyes red and teary, as if struck by something. It seemed like he suddenly remembered something, turned and ran out. [Luo Miao] behind him looked confused, standing still, watching him run out of the laboratory door.
1:26:26|1:26:44|The next morning, [Tang Chuan] changed into a new outfit and ran desperately under the bridge where [Shi Hong] passed by every day. Sweat soaked his clothes as he gasped for breath and sprinted. Pedestrians passed by constantly, including young men in suits carrying briefcases and female white-collar workers in formal attire and high heels.
1:26:44|1:26:55|There are students in school uniforms carrying backpacks, elderly people taking a stroll, and young couples sitting by the roadside cuddling together. They are intimately chatting and laughing, with sweet smiles on their faces.
1:26:55|1:27:8|[Tang Chuan] sprinted through the crowd, but seemed to run out of energy. He slowed down, gradually came to a stop, bent his legs, put his hands on his knees, bent over to catch his breath, and then continued running forward.
1:27:8|1:27:30|He ran while looking at the crowds coming and going on the roadside, the small stalls selling grilled cold noodles and fried skewers, the middle-aged man buying snacks for children, the aunties dancing in the square with smiles on their faces, the grandpas playing chess together, the old grandpa sitting in the corner boiling water, and the homeless man collecting scrap. He suddenly stopped in his tracks, staring blankly at these people, standing still and lost in thought, tears seeming to well up in his eyes but not falling.
1:27:30|1:27:35|After a moment, [Tang Chuan] turned around again and ran along the road under the bridge.
1:27:35|1:27:59|After exercising, [Tang Chuan] changed into a suit and walked into the Xinxin Snack Bar alone, carrying a briefcase. [Chen Jing] was busy serving dishes behind the counter. When she turned around, she saw [Tang Chuan]. He walked a few steps forward and said to her, "[Chen Jing]," nodded at him. Then the two of them walked outside and sat on a bench by the roadside, chatting.
1:28:42|1:28:51|[Tang Chuan] looked at [Chen Jing] as she spoke her deduction. There was a hint of uncertainty in [Chen Jing]'s eyes, she neither moved nor spoke.
1:29:7|1:29:33|[Tang Chuan] stopped halfway through his words, just staring straight ahead without moving, sitting in a chair. Beside him, [Chen Jing] suddenly turned her head to look at him, her eyes filled with confusion. [Tang Chuan] didn't continue speaking, instead he turned his head to the side. After a moment, the scene suddenly shifted to a prison cell, where [Shi Hong] lay on the bunk in a Jiangkan 319 prison uniform, staring blankly at the ceiling, surrounded by other inmates.
1:29:33|1:29:51|He suddenly saw many geometric shapes in front of his eyes, with a slight smile on his lips, seeming somewhat happy. Upon hearing someone calling his name, [Shi Hong] slowly came back to his senses, glanced in the direction of the door, then calmly sat up on the edge of the bed, lost in thought.
1:29:51|1:30:3|After a while, the prison guard handcuffed him and took him to the interrogation room, where [Tang Chuan] had been waiting for a long time. The guard opened the door, watched [Shi Hong] walk in, and then closed the door.
1:30:3|1:30:33|[Tang Chuan] glanced at [Shi Hong] with his head tilted, then looked up at the monitor and said, "[Shi Hong], sit up straight." [Shi Hong] bent over in his chair and looked up at [Tang Chuan], who then said, "[Shi Hong], a smile appeared on his face."
1:34:16|1:34:23|[Shi Hong] suddenly flashed back to the scene of himself standing on a bridge one night, throwing something into the water. After a moment of silence, he spoke:
1:34:48|1:35:17|[Shi Hong] clenched his fists on the table, bent down to look at [Tang Chuan] for a few seconds, then walked towards the door. [Tang Chuan] watched him and suddenly said, "Stop, [Shi Hong]." [Shi Hong] didn't respond, but slowly walked to the door and knocked.
1:35:24|1:35:49|The scene suddenly cuts back to the day when [Shi Hong] had an emotional breakdown. The formulas on the blackboard were erased and rewritten repeatedly, crumpled drafts filled the wastebasket. He was engulfed in despair, preparing to end his life by hanging. Just as he was about to let go, the doorbell interrupted him. [Shi Hong] opened the door, the glaring sunlight making it hard for him to keep his eyes open.
1:36:7|1:36:16|[Shi Hong] nodded at them for a moment, then gently closed the door and went back into the room to get a book. The mother and daughter smiled at each other and waited outside the door.
1:36:37|1:36:42|The mother and daughter bid farewell and left, [Shi Hong] closed the door and walked into the house.
1:36:44|1:37:7|He stood in front of the door, looking down at the small gift in his hand. It was a greeting card with a butterfly knot tied at the top, featuring a cute smiley face on the upper part and the words "Thank you for your kindness" in the middle. At the bottom, a line of small text read: Jiangbei City First Experimental Middle School. He stared at the card for a while, then lifted his head to look at the rope on the roof, as if he had figured something out.
1:38:42|1:39:5|Shi Hong's mind flashed with many scenes, including the moments when Chen Jing and Chen Xiaoxin first moved in and cleaned the house, the scene of Chen Jing receiving a threatening letter, and the scene of him with Kun Ge. With a relieved expression, he walked towards the prison cell, only to unexpectedly see Chen Jing on the way. A female police officer stood on her right, holding her arm, while Luo Miao stood on her left. Upon seeing Shi Hong, Chen Jing immediately knelt down.
1:40:8|1:40:21|[Chen Jing] knelt on the ground, apologizing and crying, while [Shi Hong] stood behind her with a heavy heart, also shedding tears. [Luo Miao] stood quietly behind them, watching everything in front of her. Not far away, [Tang Chuan] had his back turned to them, unable to bear watching.
1:40:39|1:40:57|Chen Jing and Shi Hong were taken away by the police, their cries echoing in the prison, lingering for a long time. Tang Chuan did not look back at the sound behind him, and walked out alone.
1:40:57|1:41:8|Three months later, above the sparkling sea, a few seagulls were flying low in the sky. A gentle breeze brushed by, and the dim yellow sunlight shone in the middle of the water, appearing somewhat dazzling.
1:41:8|1:41:20|In the laboratory, [Tang Chuan] sat alone at the desk, with only a desk lamp lit in the spacious and tidy room. He flipped through the experiment report in front of him, then suddenly got up and walked towards the bookshelf at the side.
1:41:20|1:41:44|[Tang Chuan] walked up to the bookshelf filled with professional books, quickly found the information he wanted to read, just as he pulled out half of it, he suddenly stopped and picked up another piece of information not far away. The cover of the parchment paper read: Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis. He opened the information, inside was a notebook, the originally semi-transparent draft paper was filled with dense formulas. [Tang Chuan] flipped through two pages, then closed the information and put it back on the bookshelf.
1:41:44|1:41:52|The next day, [Tang Chuan] came to the court alone, took out the book he wanted to read, turned around and sat back at the desk, flipping through the book on a bench.
1:41:58|1:42:5|[Luo Miao] walked out of the room while talking on the phone. As soon as he looked up, he saw [Tang Chuan]. He hung up the phone, walked over to [Tang Chuan], sat down next to him, and said:
