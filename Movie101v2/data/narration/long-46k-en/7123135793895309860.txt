0:0:32|0:0:52|The South Lake high-tech system slowly starts up, a series of complex information flows swiftly across the screen, gradually converging into a mysterious standalone icon. The symbol pauses for a moment before transforming into intricate data codes. At the same time, the positioning system begins to work, pinpointing the three main targets of this mission through satellite positioning.
0:0:52|0:0:57|They are the weapons room indoors, the command post, and the drug warehouse in the outskirts.
0:0:58|0:1:16|The support system for this mission is provided by Ambush Satellite One, located near the ancient path of Earth. The mission target is located on the southeastern border of Asia. This is a place surrounded by bio-mimetic structures, tension rising as the operational code is immediately transmitted, with a battle about to break out. At night, a sniper is ambushed in the lush bushes.
0:1:32|0:1:44|Fingers pulled the trigger, the target on the rooftop fell down as expected, and the team member below caught it steadily. Then they covered up the traces, lifted someone to kick the wall, smoothly and silently throughout the process.
0:1:44|0:1:54|The opener of the team patrols the army, and a team member reaches out from the grass, grabs his ankle, knocks him down, breaks his neck, then immediately raises the gun and signals to move forward.
0:1:55|0:2:17|Flying silently, the guard was assassinated by a sharp knife. The team members moved like a gust of wind, disappearing without a trace, gradually infiltrating the enemy's territory. Outside the abandoned factory gate, the members surrounded the entrance from both sides. On the rooftop, the successfully infiltrated member approached the ventilation opening and looked into the factory under the moonlight.
0:2:18|0:2:28|Building debris is everywhere, the enemies are not gathered, either two or three people are distributed in different locations inside the factory.
0:2:28|0:2:42|In the room, the enemies are passing time by drinking and playing cards. The scout on the rooftop notices that the enemies inside are not very alert, so after observing for a while, they use a walkie-talkie to report the situation to their teammates outside.
0:2:44|0:3:3|Outside the door, the team members on standby heard the information through their earpieces, their eyes meeting each other. One of the team members on the side saw the gesture, quickly moved to the front of the gate, took out tactical explosives, and installed them on the door. After the explosives were set up, the team member immediately retreated to their original position. The team leader nodded, signaling, and then the explosives were activated.
0:3:5|0:3:17|With a deafening roar, flames erupted as the gate was violently blown open by the shockwave, and the rooftop team members took the opportunity to throw smoke bombs. With time running out, the waiting team members outside rushed in along with the smoke.
0:3:17|0:3:25|The thugs had not reacted yet when the bullets had already pierced their bodies. The team members cooperated seamlessly, indicating that this was a well-trained team.
0:3:26|0:3:44|The firepower gradually suppressed the criminals, leaving only a few of them forced to huddle in the corner to fight back. The team members on the rooftop also took the opportunity to aim, their rifles acting like sniper rifles, one bullet, one enemy. Suddenly, a criminal hiding under the wooden planks appeared, picking up the rifle beside him to prepare to shoot. A team member spotted him just in time.
0:3:44|0:4:5|Immediately grab the gun and engage in hand-to-hand combat amidst the flying bullets. The thug's punch misses, and the team member immediately strikes with a powerful right fist, as heavy as a thunderbolt, sending the thug flying. The attack is not over yet, as the team member follows up with a flying kick, causing the thug to fall to the ground. As the thug falls, he pulls the trigger, executing a series of swift and smooth moves, effortlessly taking the opponent's life.
0:4:5|0:4:13|In the gap between gunshots, inside the room, all the criminals were shot dead, and the team members still did not relax their vigilance. The leading captain walked towards the hostage on the ground.
0:4:21|0:4:47|The captain opened the walkie-talkie and reported the results of this mission. "Go ahead," the captain lifted the hostage, blending in with the surroundings where the team members were ambushed. Upon hearing the completion of the task, they immediately moved to withdraw. They leaped through the jungle, suddenly, the team member ahead raised his hand to signal a stop, raising his gun in alert, the two of them held their breath and focused.
0:4:48|0:4:59|At the same time, they were rapidly scanning their surroundings, as if a pair of invisible eyes were watching them. In the nearby bushes, a sniper rifle was aimed at them, and a team member was wandering around, sensing the danger.
0:5:2|0:5:18|He pushed aside his teammate and took the bullet himself, falling to the ground. The enemy retreated after firing, while the teammate who was pushed shot back. Two shots were fired, and the enemy ran further away using the terrain. Unwilling to let the enemy go, he changed positions and continued shooting.
0:5:18|0:5:26|A shot fired, the bullet blocked by the trees. The second shot rang out, but the enemy had already disappeared, leaving the team members holding their guns in place.
0:5:27|0:5:43|The scene fades away, and the battle in the jungle comes to an end because of a sniper's secret shot, which resulted in his comrade [Ye Lei] getting injured and discharged. After being discharged, [Ye Lei] seemed to have disappeared. He changed his phone number and cut off all contact with his comrades.
0:5:44|0:6:4|When [Ye Feng] saw [Ye Lei] again, it was because of a murder case. A Japanese chemist was murdered while on vacation abroad, the killer being a member of a drug trafficking gang who also kidnapped the chemist's female assistant. What is the purpose of the criminal group, and what is their connection to comrade [Ye Lei]?
0:6:6|0:6:21|[Ye Feng] inadvertently discovers many secrets about [Ye Lei] while pursuing the truth. The current identity of [Ye Lei] is the owner of a tea shop, but in reality, he has become a member of a drug trafficking gang, which leads to the first highlight of this film.
0:6:39|0:6:51|Fortunately, as the plot unfolds, [Ye Lei] is not a criminal, but a secret undercover agent dispatched by the Chinese People's Police Force. When faced with danger and temptation, he still sticks to his original intention.
0:6:53|0:7:20|Accompanied by the unfolding of the metal curtain, the title "Sniper Moment" slowly appears in the center of the screen. Many years later, a military off-road vehicle is slowly driving, and a man in military uniform is returning to the army. Sometimes a certain moment in life will be forever etched in our memory, never to be erased no matter how many years pass.
0:7:34|0:7:39|The scene flashes back to the moment when a teammate was shot, the memories in the jungle are vividly visible.
0:7:53|0:8:0|They are your comrades, and the man was stopped by soldiers at the entrance of the military area.
0:8:29|0:8:34|Back at the military camp, [Ye Feng] opened the wooden box, inside of which were letters sent to [Ye Lei].
0:9:13|0:9:21|Memories flooded his mind as Ye Feng felt deeply distressed by Ye Lei's disappearance. He stood in the military camp in silence, his expression incredibly complex.
0:9:28|0:9:47|The nightmare woke up [Ye Feng], the memories of the jungle battle kept flashing in his mind. He stared at the ceiling with wide eyes, then quickly got up from the bed and walked out of the camp. The captain called out to [Ye Feng], waving his hand to signal him to come over.
0:9:47|0:9:55|[Ye Feng], who received the order, walked through the rows of soldiers towards the captain. He walked slowly to the captain, saluting him with a standard military salute.
0:10:4|0:10:7|Captain Ye Feng's eyes began to dodge.
0:10:24|0:10:29|His gaze was firm. Captain Ye lowered his head and changed the subject.
0:10:42|0:11:3|[Ye Feng] raised his hand to salute the captain, then turned around and walked away with standard marching steps. The captain looked worried, watching [Ye Feng] leave in silence. The next day, in the quiet jungle, armed soldiers broke through this bottleneck, and the exercise mentioned by the captain had begun.
0:11:3|0:11:22|The Wolf Fox Assault Team walks along the creek, the team members look tense, constantly checking the surroundings. Leading the way, [Ye Feng] leads the team forward slowly. The enemy is hidden in this silent jungle, like a snake waiting to strike, the unknown danger makes every step of the team cautious.
0:11:23|0:11:42|After investigating the captain ahead, raising his right hand into a fist, [Ye Feng] signaled the teammates behind to move forward. Taking cover from the nearby bushes, they quickly closed in on [Ye Feng], while the sniper in the team also arrived by his side. The captain pointed to his eyes with his left hand and gestured with his left arm to the rear, indicating the sniper to observe from behind.
0:11:43|0:12:2|Later, leading the team to continue moving forward, they waded through the stream, crossed over the withered trees, and kept advancing deeper into the jungle. The sniper, dressed in a camouflage suit and covered with leaves, after finding a good sniping position, seemed to have cast a invisibility spell, blending seamlessly with the environment. Without careful observation, his position could not be found at all.
0:12:2|0:12:9|On the other side, the captain led the team walking along the stream, the sound of the flowing water masking their footsteps.
0:12:11|0:12:22|The team members were clearly divided in their tasks, each covering the blind spots of their teammates, forming a comprehensive observation without any dead angles. On the other side, the sniper was using a sniper rifle to observe the surroundings.
0:12:25|0:12:27|The next moment, a gun emerges from behind the sniper.
0:12:29|0:12:47|The whistle sounded, and the sniper finally realized that someone was behind him. He turned his head awkwardly and smiled, while the other person looked at him teasingly. The sniper was captured silently, unable to help his teammates with observation and warning. The enemy seemed to know their positions inside out.
0:12:47|0:12:52|The front team members are still advancing, with the machine gunner holding a light machine gun at the rear of the team.
0:12:53|0:13:13|It's close to noon, the sunlight is shining directly into the woods, casting broken shadows of the plants. The [Huang Shilong] assault team has not yet detected the approaching enemy, and the distance between the two sides is getting closer. Crossing a stream, the team members arrive at a rugged uphill section, where the terrain is complex and it would be very difficult to retreat once engaged in battle.
0:13:14|0:13:33|Under the big tree on the side, the enemy is observing the assault team members. Taking advantage of the cover provided by the auspicious Fu, the enemy swiftly shuttles through the woods. He cautiously surveys the surroundings, somewhat resembling [Huang Shilong] who is advancing with the assault team up the mountain. Upon closer inspection, it turns out that this person was the one who had just taken out the sniper in the team.
0:13:33|0:13:47|At this moment, he no longer had the arrogance and sarcasm he had before, every move seemed particularly cautious. He found a vantage point, hid himself, aimed his gun, and quietly waited for [Huang Shilong]'s assault team's vulnerability.
0:13:47|0:14:3|A team member was immediately eliminated, the machine gunner fired wildly at the shooting position, unaware that the enemy had already changed positions. The captain and a team member escaped and ran frantically towards the destination.
0:14:3|0:14:25|The sniper who had been lying in wait took out the team leader with a shot, then changed sniper rifles. Smoke rose behind [Huang Shilong] and the other, signaling the failure of the mission. In the end, they still hadn't found the sniper's location. The sniper who completed the mission emerged from the ambush point, and only then did the team leader see the enemy's position.
0:14:25|0:14:30|Ye Feng slid down the hill and approached the two men. He carried a sniper rifle on his shoulder, looking very arrogant.
0:14:32|0:14:51|Passing by the two, deliberately hitting the other with the gun butt, showing no regard for the Blue Tiger Squad at all. The three slowly arrived at the finish line, where the captain and the previously eliminated assault team members were waiting. Sniper Ye Feng took the lead, casting a triumphant smile at the captain.
0:14:51|0:15:0|Captain Ye Feng did not respond, turned his head and walked away with a cold face. In this exercise, all members of the squad were wiped out, and it was done by one person.
0:15:1|0:15:16|Everyone looked a bit embarrassed as they left the training ground under the leadership of the squad leader. Sniper [Ye Feng] watched the Blue Lake Assault Team leave, and when he realized that no one was paying attention to him, he immediately holstered his gun and ran forward to catch up with the team as they left.
0:15:19|0:15:39|The scene shifts, the tranquil lake like a mirror, reflecting the sky and mountains. This is Dongla, a border city in Southeast Asia's country K. A woman with a remarkable figure and headphones is dancing slowly to the music. The villa on the small island indicates the extraordinary status of the owner here.
0:15:41|0:16:4|On the balcony of the villa, the woman is still immersed in the singing, swaying her waist. Behind her, a man is inspecting a trade, watching an ancient map. After confirming it is correct, he pushes a box containing a large sum of cash to the other party. The woman then turns and walks towards the one receiving the money after the transaction is completed.
0:16:13|0:16:30|The opponent did not show any alertness towards the woman, turned around and played a game with his female companion. Suddenly, the woman reached out and pushed, causing the man to be killed by the glass on the coffee table. She then grabbed her female companion's hair with her left hand, held a box of money with her right hand, and slowly left the scene.
0:16:31|0:16:35|The incident was reported on television in the country, with news from within K country.
0:16:44|0:16:59|The whereabouts of the murderer are unknown. The man in front of the TV saw the news, clasped his hands together, furrowed his brow, seemingly pondering something. The scene shifts to a teahouse where a female waitress skillfully washes and serves tea.
0:16:59|0:17:9|A man with a crew cut enters, walks through the corridor, glances at the tea artist brewing tea, then goes to the boss's desk and picks up two boxes of cigarettes.
0:17:10|0:17:26|After putting it in the pocket of his jacket, he left. The female tea doctor stared at his departing figure without saying a word the whole time. The man with a crew cut was also quite chic, unaffected by the customers in the shop. He took big strides forward and slowly left the place.
0:17:26|0:17:37|On the other side, in the unit that had finished the exercise, the [Ye Feng] assault team was being questioned by the captain. The captain slowly took off his sunglasses and continued to inquire.
0:17:52|0:18:7|The captain stared fiercely at the sniper in the squad. He then left. Among the soldiers standing in formation, the machine gunner's stature was particularly robust, catching the captain's attention.
0:18:33|0:18:39|Facing the captain's questioning, [Wang Chao] lowered his head. The captain's tone became increasingly severe.
0:19:10|0:19:25|The assault team tightened their bodies. As the members of the Blue Lake Assault Team ran away, Captain Ye Feng slowly put on his sunglasses and regained his former coldness.
0:19:25|0:19:43|On the other side, the wide and empty road was deserted, with no vehicles in sight. A jeep raced along the road, and as the camera slowly pulled back, the surrounding scenery had already left the bustling city far behind. The jeep was heading towards the mountainous area covered with dense trees.
0:19:45|0:20:2|After leaving the highway, the jeep continued to climb along the mountain road, surrounded by trees on both sides, appearing very tranquil. The vehicle didn't stop along the way, kicking up clouds of dust as the rear wheels rolled over the ground, shining brightly in the sunlight. The man slowly stopped the car and then pulled up the handbrake.
0:20:4|0:20:23|Ye Feng then unbuckled his seatbelt, opened the car door, and got out. The long journey had left him a bit weary. He stretched his neck and walked towards the main gate. The gate led directly to the courtyard, with a couplet hanging at the entrance. The characters on the couplet were already fading. Ye Feng glanced at the guards at the gate and simply walked in.
0:20:25|0:20:44|The man turned out to be the long-lost [Ye Lei], he threw a tower banknote to his younger brother and walked towards the depths of the courtyard. The courtyard was very quiet, with guards everywhere, indicating that this place was not simple. [Ye Lei] walked through the corridor, arrived at the door, pushed it open, and found his elder brother [Wa Lang] making tea.
0:20:47|0:20:58|[Ye Lei] quickly took a seat after listening, took the tea handed to him by his elder brother. His elder brother savored the tea's aroma, then drank it all in one gulp. [Ye Lei] also followed suit and took small sips.
0:21:30|0:21:42|[Ye Lei] watched as his older brother walked away, his simple and honest smile gradually fading. Then, he picked up the teapot and poured tea into the cup. His pouring hand was steady, but the tea splashed out of the cup and spilled onto the table.
0:21:48|0:21:52|The big brother took out a tablet. [Ye Lei] was very surprised when he saw it.
0:22:18|0:22:32|Ye Lei's proposal was rejected by his older brother, he lowered his head and said nothing more. In the military camp, Ye Feng was tidying up his military cap, and a teammate walked up behind him. Without turning around, Ye Feng's eyes flickered.
0:22:35|0:22:46|[Ye Feng] placed the hat on the blanket. Upon hearing this, [Ye Feng] turned around and made eye contact, while the other person turned away. [Ye Feng] asked further.
0:22:54|0:22:59|Comrades tried to take advantage and grab the gloves, but ended up empty-handed.
0:23:4|0:23:6|Another comrade came in and spoke.
0:23:7|0:23:16|Originally, they were all members of the Blue Lake Assault Team. It seems that [Ye Feng] had wiped them out before, causing the team to lose face. Now they are ready to reclaim their reputation.
0:23:16|0:23:29|[Ye Feng] followed them to the camp dormitory. As soon as he entered, some team members surrounded him. Despite being blocked from the back, [Ye Feng] did not show any fear. Facing the aggressive group, [Ye Feng] displayed his extraordinary courage.
0:23:52|0:24:5|The previous acting successfully fooled [Ye Feng], it turned out to be a surprise from everyone, pretending to be serious was just a little joke. [Ye Feng] embraced his comrades, and their relationship instantly returned to normal.
0:24:10|0:24:30|The scene shifts, [Ye Lei] is currently on the rooftop balcony practicing martial arts. He is shirtless, with a focused expression, and his bulging muscles are clearly visible. Whether throwing punches or kicking, each of his moves contains astonishing explosive power. A young woman walks up to the rooftop and silently watches [Ye Lei] exercising from behind.
0:24:30|0:24:35|In the report, the scene cuts to [Ye Feng] entering the tent where the captain is located.
0:24:47|0:24:49|[Ye Feng] did not move after hearing it.
0:25:8|0:25:28|[Ye Feng] remained silent after hearing, but the captain knew well the reason he wanted to be alone. Slowly approaching [Ye Feng], the captain gazed into his eyes and continued speaking. [Ye Feng]'s eyes turned red.
0:25:31|0:25:46|He shouted loudly as if to vent the emotions hidden in his heart. On the training ground, soldiers were engaged in intense drills, some were rock climbing bare-handed, some were crawling forward in training, and others were running.
0:25:54|0:26:17|On the shooting range, [Yang Ji] is undergoing sniper training. A shot is fired, the bullet deviates from the bullseye and lands on a distant slope. Another shot is fired, but the bullet still misses the target. Approaching quietly, [Ye Feng] provides an adjustment plan. After hesitating for a moment upon hearing it, [Yang Ji] decides to follow the instructions and starts making adjustments.
0:26:17|0:26:29|The bullet hit the 9-ring, and [Ye Feng] nodded. [Ye Feng] clapped in approval. [Yang Ji] put down the gun, stood up, stood side by side with [Ye Feng], but did not speak.
0:26:52|0:27:4|[Yang Ji] turned his head to look at [Ye Feng], his thick black eyebrows furrowed together as if pondering something. He lowered his eyes, pursed his lips, and then turned back with a smile.
0:27:10|0:27:20|[Ye Feng] smiled and slowly took off his gloves, handing them to [Yang Ji] who had his back to him, shaking them in front of his mouth.
0:27:23|0:27:34|Yang Ji was amused by Ye Feng's actions, but still refused to accept his glove. The two of them bantered back and forth. Finally, Ye Feng got angry and slapped the glove on Yang Ji's head.
0:27:39|0:28:2|[Ye Feng] handed the gloves to Yang Ji, then smiled and jogged away. The scene shifted to the street, where an old-fashioned Volkswagen taxi slowly approached. The right turn signal lit up as the taxi gradually pulled over to the side of the road. After the car came to a stop, the door opened. Dressed in a leather jacket, [Ye Feng] slowly stepped out from the back seat.
0:28:2|0:28:12|Since getting off the car, he has been staring into the distance, not even bothering to ask for the taxi fare. He stood at the intersection for a while before heading towards the street.
0:28:42|0:28:51|Guided by the tea master, [Ye Feng] hesitated for a moment before picking up the cup. The female tea master then turned around to fetch the kettle behind her.
0:29:1|0:29:10|[Ye Feng] was shocked to hear this, his eyes fixed on the tea master. His eyes flickered slightly, then he drank the tea in his mouth.
0:29:14|0:29:38|Outside the door, [Ye Lei], who was about to make a call back, saw [Ye Feng] inside the house and immediately concealed his figure to retreat. At this moment, [Ye Feng] also finished his conversation with Cha Yishi and got up to leave. Cha Yishi did not stop him, but stared in the direction [Ye Feng] was leaving. The previous friendliness and smile gradually disappeared from his face, and the scene gradually faded away. After the investigation, [Ye Feng] sat in the car heading back to the team.
0:29:47|0:30:6|The scenery around quickly passed by, [Ye Feng] sitting silently in the passenger seat. By the beautiful lakeside, a woman was leaning on the railing, gazing at the scenery, with seagulls circling around, as beautiful as a painting. [Ye Lei] walked slowly over and stopped beside the woman.
0:30:26|0:30:33|The woman turned out to be the tea artist in the Night Thunder Palace, named Xiao Lu. Night Thunder continued to feed the seabirds.
0:30:48|0:31:4|[Ye Lu] suddenly turned his head after hearing, his eyes fixed on [Ye Lei]. He looked at [Ye Lei], his gaze gradually lowering. After listening to [Ye Lei]'s words, [Xiao Lu] turned his head away, seeming unwilling to answer the question.
0:31:6|0:31:24|The scene shifts to a hilltop where a jeep slowly approaches. The members of Ping 81 gang waiting on the hill leave the car to greet them on the street. Ye Feng's elder brother Huang Shilong steps out of the jeep and embraces the members of Ping 81 gang before speaking.
0:31:33|0:31:48|While the two were talking, a Mitsubishi Jeep raced past. Through the car window, [Huang Shilong] and [Lu Liang] were seen, prompting the Jeep to immediately reverse and change direction. After stopping, the four members of the Non-Police Team got out of the car and walked towards the other party.
0:31:48|0:31:56|The unarmed team is fully armed, with gun holsters placed at the waist in three directions, facing [Huang Shilong] and [Ping Ba], the unarmed team maintains a high level of vigilance.
0:31:58|0:32:19|Huang Shilong's henchman behind him just pulled out the hidden pistol from his back, but was stopped by the boss and put it back. The SWAT team began a routine inspection. [Lu Liang] stared at the SWAT team, slowly reached into his pants pocket, took out his ID and handed it to them. The SWAT team took the ID, compared it, confirmed it was correct, then turned to look at Huang Shilong.
0:32:21|0:32:32|Pang Ba turned his head to signal his henchmen, but at this moment, there was a noise coming from the trunk of the car. Pang Ba remained indifferent, while the armed police immediately drew their guns.
0:32:35|0:32:42|Pan Ba walked helplessly towards the trunk, while a sniper rifle aimed at them from a distance, the sniper adjusting the scope.
0:32:44|0:32:53|After checking the sniper rifle, [Ping Ba] and others had already reached the rear of the car. He reluctantly opened the trunk, as if trying to delay the time.
0:32:53|0:33:13|The trunk slowly opens, revealing a woman with her limbs bound and mouth gagged. The armed police officers are stunned by this sight. A sniper in the distance fires a shot, killing the closest officer to the trunk. [Ye Feng]'s men hear the gunshot and immediately spring into action, engaging in combat with the other officers. Another officer is shot by the sniper.
0:33:13|0:33:30|At this moment, there were only two armed police left on the scene. [Ye Feng] also joined the battle, disrupting an armed police officer who was about to support his teammate. The sniper was always swiftly leaving, and with the teammate's heavy shot, he died. The last armed police officer also fell to the ground and couldn't get up. The fallen police officer fiercely grabbed [Ye Feng]'s trouser leg.
0:33:34|0:33:52|Seeing this scene, [Ping Ba] cautiously approached with a gun in hand, aiming at the head of [Walang]. [Walang] coldly stared back at him, then with two moves, he pushed away the opponent's gun with his left hand and took the gun with his right hand. Without hesitation, he pulled the trigger at the fallen armed police officer.
0:33:52|0:34:12|After all this, [Valan] returned the pistol to [Pingba]. The sudden trust crisis between the two slightly eased after the previous scene. The picture gradually faded away. In the room of [Ye Lei], Xiao Lu knocked on the door and entered. [Ye Lei] quickly put down the water glass and hid the clothes beside him.
0:34:18|0:34:29|The exquisite tea box is placed on the table, and Xiao Lu smiles with narrowed eyes. Xiao Lu looks a bit disappointed.
0:34:31|0:34:49|[Ye Lei] nodded in agreement. Xiao Lu's enthusiasm was futile on this man with a determined face. Xiao Lu could only helplessly turn and leave. [Ye Lei] watched the direction the other person left in, while turning his head to contemplate, as if burdened with many thoughts. He took a sip and drank the water in the cup.
0:34:51|0:35:10|On the other side, after the battle, Pingba brought the woman from the trunk to a wooden house. The room was dark, he walked in and went to the innermost room, where the woman was roughly thrown on the ground. He looked around in fear and admiration. Pingba entered the room and sat down beside his eldest brother Mujin.
0:35:32|0:35:46|On the other side, [Ye Lei] drove to the front of the tea shop, where Xiao Lu was seeing off the guests.
0:36:10|0:36:16|He turned around to close the shop door, while [Ye Lei] stared closely at his departing figure, seemingly pondering something.
0:36:18|0:36:32|Moon rises above the willow branches, people gather after dusk, [Ye Lei]'s car stopped in front of a restaurant with strong ethnic characteristics. The attic style is in Chinese architecture, and the large lanterns at the entrance leave a deep impression. The two got out of the car and walked into the restaurant.
0:36:35|0:36:50|The time was already late, yet there were still scattered customers dining here. Along with the dim light above each table, the steaming hot food, and the distinctive large lanterns, a sharp contrast was formed with the already darkened surroundings.
0:36:50|0:36:57|[Ye Lei] and Xiao Lu climbed the wooden stairs to the second floor and found a place to sit down.
0:36:59|0:37:19|The two sat facing each other, [Ye Feng] picked up the water kettle on the table and poured tea into Xiao Lu's cup. The food was served, looking very tempting, Xiao Lu kept picking up food with her chopsticks and eating rice. [Ye Feng] did not eat, he freely released the chopsticks with his hands, letting them collide with the table, making a rhythmic sound.
0:37:30|0:37:41|Xiao Lu looked a bit puzzled when she saw this scene. She stopped eating and asked [Ye Feng]. After stopping, Xiao Lu revealed a lovely smile.
0:37:44|0:37:50|Xiao Lu's eyes and eyebrows drooped, giving her a somewhat playful girl-next-door look, shyness vivid on her face.
0:38:10|0:38:21|[Ye Feng] frowned upon hearing this, the Alliance logo showing off on her clothes. Xiao Lu chuckled at her simple and honest gesture. At this moment, a text message disrupted the harmony.
0:38:22|0:38:40|[Ye Lei] picked up the phone and unlocked it, only to find a message from his big brother. Xiao Lu noticed him staring at the phone intently, with no change in expression. The unlocked phone displayed the time as 11:51 PM. [Ye Lei] looked at the message his big brother sent just a minute ago, and quietly deleted it.
0:38:44|0:38:56|[Ye Lei] got up and left, while Xiao Lu stared at his back closely. As soon as his figure disappeared at the staircase, Xiao Lu immediately picked up [Ye Lei]'s phone and then opened his own backpack.
0:38:56|0:39:4|Xiao Lu searched in the bag and took out an electronic device, then inserted it into Ye Lei's phone, and the screen showed data being copied.
0:39:5|0:39:21|Originally, the information on Ye Lei's phone was quickly being transferred and copied to Xiao Lu's device. Xiao Lu occasionally glanced at the stairs, alert for Ye Lei's sudden return. Once the data transfer was complete, Xiao Lu immediately put the phone back in its original position.
0:39:21|0:39:28|At this moment, Ye Lei had just finished using the restroom and walked up the stairs. Ye Lei approached and looked at Xiao Lu, asking.
0:39:31|0:39:43|A phone call came in, and the smile on [Ye Lei]'s face disappeared. [Ye Lei] picked up the phone from the table, looking at the incoming call from her elder brother, instinctively wanting to answer. After hesitating for a moment, her brother hung up the phone.
0:39:49|0:40:1|[Ye Lei] finished speaking, turned around and left, and started talking to his older brother. [Xiao Lu] looked at the other person, his expression slowly changing from gentle to cold, as if he had become a different person. The scene switched to the military camp.
0:40:36|0:40:49|On the other side, in the cabin where [Colonel Magnolia Lock] is located, a woman wearing high-heeled leather boots walks in. She walks towards the girl Xiaomei who was previously locked in the trunk.
0:41:8|0:41:25|[Kana] whispered in his ear, then he gently touched Xiaomei's face. Xiaomei was startled by his touch, with an indescribable fear in her eyes. On the street, a car slowly stopped by the roadside, and when the window rolled down, it was [Kana] wearing sunglasses.
0:41:25|0:41:30|He took off his sunglasses and looked across the road, only to find that it was the teahouse run by [Ye Lei].
0:41:31|0:41:50|Investigator Xiao Lu is packing up things at the door of the shop, making sure the other party has not noticed. Ye Feng picks up the camera placed on the passenger seat, aims the lens at Xiao Lu, and presses the shutter button. One, two, three shots, he keeps shooting, capturing every move of Xiao Lu in the camera.
0:41:50|0:42:9|After confirming the opponent's appearance with the camera, [Kana] retrieved the camera and drove away. Then he arrived at the wooden house where [Mu Jin] was located. The interior of the house was extremely dim, illuminated only by the light passing through the glass. Mu Jin walked out of the room, dressed in camouflage military uniform, making herself look like a soldier.
0:42:28|0:42:46|The scene cuts back to the teahouse, where a phone is vibrating on the table. Xiaolu picks up the phone, glances at the incoming call information, and then hands the phone to [Ye Lei] beside her. [Ye Lei] takes the phone, first looks at Xiaolu who has turned away, and then turns around to answer the call.
0:42:50|0:43:4|After hanging up the phone, [Ye Lei] furrowed his brows in thought, then turned and walked towards Xiao Lu. Xiao Lu smiled at him. The box opened, revealing a belt.
0:43:6|0:43:17|Xiao Lu smiled and put the gift box aside, then reached out with both hands towards [Ye Lei]'s waist. [Ye Lei] was completely stunned by this sudden move, looking at Xiao Lu in disbelief.
0:43:43|0:43:53|[Ye Lei] nodded with a smile after listening. At this moment, the belt around his waist had quietly been changed. [Ye Lei] was stopped by Xiao Lu.
0:43:55|0:43:58|Xiao Lu took a step towards him.
0:44:2|0:44:12|[Ye Lei] nodded, indicating the other person to continue speaking. After listening, [Ye Lei] turned his head, looked out the window, and said to [Xiao Lu] with his back facing her.
0:44:18|0:44:23|After Xiao Lu finished speaking, Ye Feng looked complicated and glanced at the ground.
0:44:30|0:44:46|[Xiao Lu]'s words revealed his speculation about [Ye Lei]'s identity. [Ye Lei] was very surprised when she heard it, she turned her head to look at him. Facing [Ye Lei]'s gaze, [Xiao Lu] and her locked eyes. Without saying a word, [Ye Lei] chuckled softly and then turned around and left.
0:44:46|0:44:58|[Xiao Lu] took a step forward, wanting to hold back, but the thought was just rising when she remembered [Ye Lei]'s toughness. On the other side, inside the military conference room.
0:45:25|0:45:28|Another photo appears. The leader looks at [Captain].
0:46:17|0:46:26|Warriors observed and located the target through the screen before beginning their infiltration. In the quiet jungle, the camouflaged member of the assault team, [Blue Fox], was swiftly moving.
0:46:27|0:46:47|They crossed through the complex terrain of the jungle, with team members close to each other to respond promptly to unexpected situations. They arrived at a tea garden, where the paths on both sides of the tea trees and the leaves provided them with natural cover. They slowly climbed up the hillside, blending their clothes with nature.
0:46:47|0:47:1|Upon reaching the destination, the leading captain suddenly stopped and waited for further instructions. In the heavily guarded command vehicle not far away, [Captain Ye Feng] was assigning tasks.
0:47:1|0:47:14|On the other side, Wang Chao finished the meeting, walked out of the quaint courtyard, and the ambush Blue Fox assault team had already taken their positions. Sniper Ye Feng observed the situation and reported back to his teammates.
0:47:17|0:47:20|[Ye Feng] discovered a new situation.
0:47:30|0:47:34|The obscured figure turned his head, and [Ye Feng]'s profile appeared in the sniper scope.
0:47:38|0:48:7|[Ye Feng] saw that [Ye Lei] was a bit distracted, understanding that he immediately adjusted his focus back to the sniper scope and began to wait. Ping Ba exposed a flaw, his military nature kept his emotions in check. However, at this moment, [Ye Feng] appeared to be in great pain. Suddenly, [Ye Lei] left, presenting a rare opportunity for Ping Ba, but [Ye Feng] did not give up. He held his breath, waited for the right moment, found a good position, and then fired a shot, killing Ping Ba.
0:48:14|0:48:33|At the military camp shooting range, bullets steadily pierced through the stone rings. [Ye Feng], who had just finished a mission, was practicing shooting. At this moment, [Ye Feng] appeared preoccupied, as if [Ye Lei] was by his side in a trance. With a shot fired, a smile bloomed on [Ye Lei]'s face.
0:48:35|0:48:54|The scene just now was just a sudden awakening memory of [Ye Feng]. He looked at the empty space beside him, [Ye Lei] did not appear, but appeared in his scope not long ago. [Ye Feng] couldn't figure it out, he could only rely on practicing shooting to temporarily suppress his inner emotions.
0:48:54|0:49:1|At this moment, Captain Huang Shilong walked slowly from behind. Upon hearing the footsteps, [Ye Feng] immediately put down the sniper rifle and stood up to salute the captain.
0:49:3|0:49:10|[Ye Feng] locked eyes with the captain, then suddenly smiled. The appearance of [Ye Lei] completely threw his heart into chaos.
0:49:25|0:49:39|Captain Ye Feng turned his head after listening. But just five hours ago. He suddenly appeared in front of us, to be precise.
0:49:43|0:49:51|[Ye Feng]’s eyes changed, and he questioned the captain seriously. The captain remained silent. [Ye Feng] took a step forward and continued to ask.
0:50:3|0:50:6|Ye Feng's tone gradually changed.
0:50:13|0:50:29|Captain Ye Feng slowly took off his sunglasses, his eyes fixed on [Ye Feng] with a puzzled and profound look. He took a deep breath, the corners of his mouth slightly downturned, revealing a sense of disappointment. Without saying a word, he walked away, leaving [Ye Feng] standing there in a daze.
0:50:29|0:50:38|He, who did not get an answer, felt extremely lost in his heart, as time passed bit by bit. As the sun set in the west, the soldiers on the training ground returned to the barracks.
0:51:5|0:51:20|Six fighter jets streaked across the sky, heading towards the sunset. The high-speed airflow left six beautiful straight lines in the air. [Yang Ji] took a harmonica out of his pocket, looked at the scenery in front of him, and started playing it absentmindedly.
0:51:36|0:51:54|In an abandoned factory, a car drove in, breaking the bottleneck here. The car suddenly stopped, with Kana sitting in the driver's seat and the hostage Xiaomei sitting in the passenger seat. Xiaomei got out of the car, followed closely by Kana, and they arrived in front of a huge cylindrical machine lying horizontally.
0:51:54|0:52:0|The machinery is densely covered with screws the size of fists, resembling an enlarged version of a wolf's fang baton.
0:52:1|0:52:21|Xiao Mei led the way through the bottom, and they arrived at a location. They lifted the covering wooden board, and then, a small underground space appeared, with a square box covered in dust for a long time. Seeing the task completed, Kana patted Xiao Mei's shoulder, and his right hand gently brushed across Xiao Mei's neck.
0:52:21|0:52:28|Following that, a faint light of spiritual energy appeared, and Xiao Mei and Ming fell into the underground space just now.
0:52:30|0:52:50|On the other side, [Ye Lei] opened a drawer and placed a mechanical device on the belt given to her earlier. Wearing a high-necked long-sleeved shirt, [Ye Lei]'s prominent muscles stretched the entire garment. Her determined face frowned, looking silently at the belt in front of her, as if recalling the girl who gave her this gift.
0:52:52|0:53:12|The scene shifts, [Ye Lei] follows his elder brother [Wa Lang] to the small wooden house where Mu Jin is located. There are soldiers guarding the door, all armed with real guns. As the two are about to enter, the guard stops them. [Wa Lang] looks at [Ye Lei] behind him, signals for himself to go in alone, while [Ye Lei] waits at the door.
0:53:15|0:53:17|The guard kicked out, [Walang] knelt on the ground.
0:53:27|0:53:29|The pistol is pressed against [Valan]'s head.
0:53:33|0:53:38|Mujin faced the window, with [Valan] and the guard behind her. After a moment of silence, she spoke.
0:53:47|0:53:59|In the military conference room, a photo of Kana appears. Once a world shooting champion, now the bodyguard of [Ye Feng].
0:54:11|0:54:24|The captain nodded in agreement after hearing. As the sun rose, when the sky was still dim, [Tian Hai] had already gotten up and started practicing with a good posture. His roommate [Yang Ji] suddenly woke up and looked at his energetic roommate, feeling somewhat helpless.
0:54:28|0:54:49|After speaking, [Yang Ji] lifted the blanket and returned to bed. After lying down for a while, [Tian Hai] remained indifferent. [Yang Ji] helplessly got up again. He took out a harmonica and played it gently in the cramped dormitory.
0:55:12|0:55:17|After the practice, [Tian Hai] performed the finishing move, and the sound of the zither slowly started to play again.
0:55:33|0:56:2|Xiao Lu, who changed into casual clothes in the mall, looked around before walking into a women's clothing store. The business in the store was very quiet, with only a few customers. Xiao Lu bypassed the salesperson and looked with interest at the clothes in front of her. She then walked to another shelf and started to pick out clothes. Inadvertently, she turned her head and met the gaze of another female customer who was also selecting clothes behind her. For a moment, the two of them both turned their heads back and continued to choose clothes.
0:56:4|0:56:21|Xiao Lu picked up a Nizi coat from the shelf and walked into the changing room. The customer who met her gaze looked at her again. Inside the changing room, [Xiao Lu] did not try on the clothes, but opened the leather bag that Ye Lei had used before.
0:56:21|0:56:29|Outside the dressing room, the female customer did not leave. At this moment, [Xiao Lu] opened the door of the dressing room, glanced at the other party, and then left quietly.
0:56:30|0:56:48|The coat inside remained hanging on the wall untouched. A female customer casually picked up a dress and walked into the dressing room. After [Xiao Lu] walked out of the clothing store, she stood still and walked to the right, while the customer followed her and went in the completely opposite direction of [Xiao Lu]'s route.
0:56:48|0:57:6|At this moment, [Kana] in a leather jacket appeared. She was holding a newly bought drink, glanced in the direction where the female customer had left, and continued to follow not far behind [Xiao Lu], keeping a close watch. [Xiao Lu] was unaware of being followed from behind, walking on her own.
0:57:6|0:57:18|Two people in the crowded place appeared very ordinary. Suddenly, a pair of movers blocked Ye Feng's path, they were carrying a huge mirror and moving it, with the mirror facing Ye Feng.
0:57:18|0:57:33|So, [Xiao Lu] saw [Kana] not far behind her, then without saying a word, she made a sharp turn around the mirror and hid in the group of porters. Kana was looking at her phone at that moment, and only when she looked up did she realize that [Xiao Lu] had disappeared without a trace.
0:57:34|0:57:47|Kana stood at the disappearing spot of the sales road, looking around anxiously. After determining a direction, he started running. With determination, Kana caught up with Ye Feng again.
0:57:47|0:57:55|He watched as [Xiaolu] walked out of the mall. This time, to prevent losing track, the distance between them seemed to have narrowed, about 8 body lengths apart.
0:57:56|0:58:8|[Xiao Lu] arrived at a nostalgic residential area, where there weren't many people around, but [Xiao Lu] didn't stop walking. In order to avoid being noticed by Kana, even glances back on the way lasted only a few seconds.
0:58:8|0:58:22|At a bend, he stopped and was about to leave after making sure it was safe, when a needle pierced into his neck. [Xiao Lu] released his right hand, the bag he was holding fell freely, and his freed hand fiercely struck towards the opponent's face.
0:58:23|0:58:40|Repeated attacks were all blocked by the opponent's arms, so [Xiao Lu] put all his strength into elbow strikes and knee strikes, completing the combat move of elbow bump in boxing. The two of them then engaged in close combat, with [Xiao Lu] seizing the opportunity to grab the needle tube from earlier and forcefully stabbing it towards the opponent.
0:58:40|0:58:57|Unfortunately, just as the needle stopped above Kana's eye, the drug in the syringe took effect, causing [Xiao Lu] to lose consciousness and collapse. At that moment, a parked off-road vehicle quickly started up and arrived in front of Kana. A henchman got out of the car, put the unconscious [Xiao Lu] into the trunk.
0:58:57|0:59:10|Kana looked proud and completed the mission smoothly. He put on his earphones again, started the off-road vehicle, and drove away. On the other side, [Valan] drove with [Ye Lei] on the rugged mountain road, with dust flying as the car passed by.
0:59:22|0:59:37|[Ye Lei] listened and [Walang] analyzed the situation. The two gradually arrived at the abandoned cement factory. Mujin had already arrived early, Kana was also on the scene, all the henchmen were dressed in camouflage suits, holding steel guns tightly in their hands, fully armed.
0:59:37|0:59:48|After the car came to a stop, [Ye Lei] and [Wa Lang] got out of the car. They were calm and composed as they walked towards the other side. [Wa Lang] approached and hugged Mujin.
1:0:1|1:0:4|The style of the film suddenly changed, and [Mu Jin]'s smile froze on his face.
1:0:9|1:0:26|[Jin] hesitated for a moment after hearing, then turned to look at [Kana], gesturing for him to lead the way. [Jin] looked at Valan, smiled, and lightly punched his chest. Valan also stepped forward, signaling with his eyes to [Ye Lei]. [Ye Lei] raised an eyebrow and followed the rest of the team forward.
1:0:26|1:0:30|On the other side, the [Blue Fox Special Assault Team] has assembled completely.
1:0:46|1:0:55|The captain received the order, saluted, and then jogged to the front of the transport vehicle. The two military vehicles carrying the [Blue Lake Assault Team] set off from the camp.
1:0:58|1:1:1|Tanks, radar vehicles, armed helicopters, and more are all gathered.
1:1:3|1:1:22|They held their ground at the camp, constantly waiting for the fate that awaited them, waiting for news of the [Blue Tiger Squad]'s next move. Inside the concrete city, a younger brother lifted the thickly dust-covered wooden box, revealing markings indicating it was something left behind by the Japanese 18th Army. Little Mei, who had been killed earlier, was found inside.
1:1:22|1:1:40|The younger brother stepped over the bodies, carried the wooden box up, and brought it to [Valan] and [Mujin]. After the box was opened, [Ye Lei] frowned and stared, [Valan] squatted down to observe the formation closely, and after seeing the contents clearly, his pupils suddenly contracted.
1:2:9|1:2:13|[Ye Lei] suddenly interrupted, which made [Mu Jin] very unhappy.
1:2:20|1:2:29|Valan chuckled lightly after listening, then closed the box with his foot. Valan took out a gun and threatened Mu Jin.
1:2:33|1:2:48|[Jin] finished speaking, immediately pushed the gun with his hand, aimed the muzzle at [Valang] and fired. [Kana] also stepped forward to reload the gun, while [Ye Lei] was ambushed by his henchmen. [Kana] gathered strength and kicked him unconscious, the Blue Lake assault team that had already arrived began their infiltration mission around the cement plant perimeter.
1:2:49|1:3:4|Several people took the lead in the investigation, one person was responsible for the rear guard, and the team members communicated solely through gestures, advancing layer by layer in an orderly manner. In the concrete city, [Mu Jin]'s henchmen dragged away [Wa Lang]'s body, while [Kana] searched [Ye Lei] on the side.
1:3:4|1:3:18|Upon feeling the bulging object around his waist, [Kana]'s expression changed noticeably. He unfastened [Ye Lei]'s belt and examined it carefully. Sensing that something was amiss, he immediately pulled out the belt and handed it to [Mu Jin] standing nearby. [Mu Jin] gestured with her eyes for Kana to leave.
1:3:21|1:3:27|A basin of cold water woke up the fainting Ye Lei, Mu Jin walked up and pinched his chin, saying.
1:3:41|1:3:53|Now I need you to cooperate with me and help me get these things out. [Ye Lei]'s disguise was exposed by [Mu Jin], but he remained calm, staring at [Mu Jin] with cold eyes.
1:3:53|1:4:11|Both sides are engaged in a game of wits. The Blue Tiger team, who sneaked into the cement plant, kept moving. They arrived at the wall on the outskirts of the plant, where the abandoned buildings looked somewhat dilapidated. Apart from the traces left by time, there was no sense of danger. The Blue Tiger team observed the interior of the cement plant through the cracks in the wall.
1:4:11|1:4:15|However, the enemies had already discovered them and hidden their whereabouts in advance.
1:4:38|1:4:40|[Ye Lei] had his hands tied and kept rubbing them in an attempt to break free.
1:4:54|1:5:13|[Ye Lei] did not respond, his hands continued to move without stopping. On the side of the Blue Lake Assault Team, unable to confirm their safety, they remained still, while the enemy quietly launched an attack. A hand grenade was thrown, and the members of the Blue Lake team immediately reacted.
1:5:13|1:5:19|The intense explosion went off nearby, knocking down the Blue Lake assault team members separated by only one layer with a violent shockwave.
1:5:21|1:5:36|Night Thunder, Mu Jin fired another shot, causing Xiao Lu's legs to be completely disabled. Ye Lei heard the explosion, turned his head to look outside, in the thick smoke, bullets mixed with fire were flying in all directions towards the members of the Blue Lake Assault Team.
1:5:37|1:5:49|The sudden action of the enemy caught them off guard, and the members of [Blue Lake Assault Team] quickly adjusted and began to organize a counterattack. The enemy's position at a high point was very disadvantageous to them, so the team members prioritized their attacks and cleared them out one by one.
1:5:49|1:5:56|[Ye Lei] over here, the henchman who set up the timed bomb signals to Mujin, who walks towards [Ye Lei] and points a gun at him.
1:5:58|1:6:14|Night Thunder suddenly surged forward, twisting Mu Jin's gun backhandedly and aiming it at the henchman behind him. At the same time, the members of the Blue Lake Assault Team who were fighting fiercely with Mu Jin's henchmen gradually gained the upper hand, taking down the hidden enemies one by one. With strong cover and an astonishing hit rate, they dominated the battlefield.
1:6:14|1:6:31|On the other side, Ye Lei, who knocked down Mu Jin, kicked away the henchman's machine gun, pressed the pistol against the henchman's chest, and fired two shots in a row, quickly resolving the henchman. Back to the main battlefield, the [Wolf Fox Team] (Blue Fox Assault Team) quickly surrounded the enemy, trapping them in their attacking rhythm and continuously reducing their numbers.
1:6:31|1:6:42|In the shadow of Wuda's Water Thunder Tower, [Ye Feng] made a sliding move, suddenly appearing from below. After successfully taking out the last hidden enemy on the tower, he quickly returned to the team, and the scene shifted back to this side of [Ye Lei].
1:6:43|1:6:59|He shot and took out Mujin. The timed bomb that was set earlier now has less than 30 seconds left before it explodes. [Ye Lei] put down his gun and started defusing the bomb. On the other side, the Blue Tiger team, having dealt with the enemy unscathed, began a new round of reconnaissance.
1:6:59|1:7:17|The team, previously scattered due to the operation, gradually gathered following the captain's assembly gesture. The members crouched down, shifted their weight downwards, and moved slowly while continuously firing around, maintaining a vigilant state. They kept their guns in hand, ready to engage in combat at any moment.
1:7:17|1:7:31|The team members gathered by a wall, with a broad field of vision. In case of a surprise attack, they could quickly organize a defense and counterattack. After assembling, the team members knelt down, and one of them took out a drone to start reconnaissance.
1:7:32|1:7:51|A drone flew overhead, displaying an aerial view on the screen. Captain Ye Feng carefully observed before folding the screen and scanning the surrounding buildings, forming a rough plan in his mind. He then assigned tasks to the team members beside him, and after receiving the orders, they set off to carry out the mission.
1:7:51|1:8:2|The captain left two to three people behind to stand by, while he himself led [Ye Feng] to the stairs. At this point, [Ye Feng] switched to a sniper rifle and climbed straight up the stairs towards the vantage point.
1:8:25|1:8:43|[After taking position, Ye Feng's temperament changed drastically. His whole being was highly focused, and the sniper rifle in his hands seemed to become another eye, constantly scanning everything in the corner of the cement yard. On the other side, the Blue Lake Assault Team left the initial battlefield and gradually moved deeper into the dangerous factory building.]
1:8:43|1:9:0|The interior structure of the factory is complex, and in an inconspicuous corner, there may be unknown enemies lurking. The team stopped near a staircase, which is a must-pass route to the interior, and time is of the essence as [Ye Lei] inside is still waiting for the team's rescue.
1:9:0|1:9:12|The captain gestured for [Ye Feng] to slowly go upstairs to investigate, facing the imminent danger alone. After a brief investigation, it seemed safe upstairs, and the captain signaled safety.
1:9:12|1:9:29|The team was slowly moving upstairs, but the captain suddenly glanced down and saw a faint laser beam aimed at the team member's feet. Realizing something was wrong, the captain rushed forward and pushed the team member away, and the explosion resounded deafeningly in that instant.
1:9:35|1:9:51|Captain Ye Feng's precise judgment in a critical moment successfully saved a team member's life. After confirming that everyone was unharmed, the captain gave a hand signal to move down, and everyone's bodies pressed close to the ground. Using the strength of their arms and legs to push forward, they began to crawl.
1:9:51|1:10:0|The surrounding cover is relatively low at this time, which is undoubtedly the safest method. The scene shifts to [Ye Lei], where the timer on the bomb shows only the last two seconds.
1:10:1|1:10:11|At the critical moment, [Ye Lei] pulled out the fuse connecting the explosives, and the timer finally stopped. At this moment, there was less than a second left before the explosion.
1:10:11|1:10:24|[Ye Lei], who successfully resolved the crisis, didn't have time to check his own injuries. He rushed to the side where [Xiao Lu] had fallen. He held Xiao Lu in his arms, who had been shot for a long time and was already somewhat dazed.
1:10:26|1:10:41|Upon seeing that it was [Ye Lei] who lifted him up, a familiar smile appeared on [Xiao Lu]'s face. To die in the arms of a loved one might also be a kind of relief. Concealing his identity, he interacted with [Ye Lei] all the way, but inadvertently fell in love with the man before him.
1:10:41|1:10:58|Watching [Xiao Lu] who had already left, [Ye Lei]'s expression was extremely complex. He leaned his face close to [Xiao Lu]'s forehead, bidding her a final farewell. On the other side, the Blue Tiger team that had infiltrated the venue stopped at a spacious area. What awaited them next was a staircase without any cover.
1:10:58|1:11:12|The captain took out a drone for observation. The only road to the destination was this one. The Blue Tiger team had no choice but to grit their teeth and set off. At this moment, a team member stepped forward, standing on the stairs, cautiously probing step by step.
1:11:12|1:11:27|Not far away, Ye Feng was lying on the ground, his sniper rifle ready to fire. With a shot fired, a team member's right leg was immediately injured and fell down. The captain behind him saw this and rushed to the injured team member, trying to pull him back.
1:11:43|1:12:5|Find him for me. [Ye Feng] on the rooftop started to move rapidly, his high-speed running caught Kana's attention. Kana suddenly turned around, aimed at [Ye Feng], and pulled the trigger. The bullet exploded behind [Ye Feng]. However, [Ye Feng] had already completed the platform with a gap of several meters between buildings, which did not stop his footsteps. After landing, [Ye Feng] used a roll to offset the impact.
1:12:5|1:12:19|He quickly found a wall to take cover behind, adjusting his position to observe the opponent. However, Kana's sniper rifle seemed to have eyes of its own, and without a clear line of sight, it managed to wound Ye Feng's left shoulder through the wall.
1:12:21|1:12:35|The Wolf Fox team took the opportunity to break out immediately, suppressing the firepower to where Kana was, while rescuing the teammate who had just been injured. Kana's attack rhythm was disrupted, and he had to seek cover to hide, waiting for the opportunity to attack again.
1:12:35|1:12:50|The Wolf Fox Assault Team was suppressing firepower, while team member [Lu Liang] tried to take advantage of the situation to cross the stairs to the other side. However, Kana turned around and the bullet pierced through [Lu Liang]'s chest, the powerful impact sending him down the stairs, crashing heavily onto the opposite side.
1:12:51|1:13:3|[Lu Liang] had a vacant look in his eyes, blood oozing from his mouth. He used to be a big boy who joked with his teammates, but now, in order to complete the mission, he sacrificed himself in this abandoned cement plant.
1:13:3|1:13:22|In his final memory before leaving, the image of the hometown's intersection, the longing gaze of his wife, and the eager look of his children waiting for their father, all converged in the mind of [Lu Liang]. As he was about to depart, [Lu Liang]'s eyes gradually became dull, but in his pupils, the images of his daughter and wife were reflected like flesh.
1:13:24|1:13:39|On the other side, after dealing with Mu Jin, [Ye Lei] arrived at the battlefield. He shot frantically towards the sky where Kana was, refusing to back down. Kana dodged quickly and retaliated with sniper fire. Just as he was about to change positions, [Ye Lei] seized the opportunity.
1:13:39|1:13:53|After a brief incident, Kana was unharmed and moved to another location, with [Ye Lei] following closely behind. [Ye Feng], who was previously injured by Kana, regained consciousness at this moment. He lay on the ground, slowly reaching towards his wound with his left hand.
1:13:53|1:14:7|The intense pain made him almost unable to move, but his right hand still reached forward with the strength of his body. The sniper rifle was right in front of him, but the immobile [Ye Feng] turned this distance into an insurmountable chasm for him.
1:14:8|1:14:27|Ten centimeters, five centimeters, getting closer gradually. [Ye Feng], at this moment, with astonishing willpower, slowly moved his body and struggled to move his right hand. At this moment, he was only a hair's breadth away from the sniper rifle's position, climbing onto the rooftop's parapet, rolling swiftly like a meticulous cheetah pouncing forward.
1:14:27|1:14:32|He concealed his good mood and didn't rush to attack, just quietly waiting for the prey to reveal a flaw.
1:14:58|1:15:16|At this moment, the hand outside the wall made the exact same signal for shooting as during the training. After [Ye Lei] gave [Ye Feng] the signal, he immediately moved towards the location where Kana was. [Ye Feng] slowly supported his body at this moment, and his single hand that was continuously bleeding had already formed a pool of blood on the ground.
1:15:16|1:15:32|Kana sensed something was wrong and cautiously peeked out, only to be firmly blocked by the arrival of [Ye Lei], forcing him to wait in place. [Ye Feng], using all his strength, stood up, unable to use his injured hands, becoming the stabilizer for his mechanical gun at that moment.
1:15:33|1:15:54|The person and the gun were highly integrated. He pulled the trigger towards 1 o'clock direction, and the bullet that flew past hit Kana's head from behind successfully. Kana fell forward, the sniper rifle in his hand and the wig fell together. The mysterious sniper who had been invincible on the battlefield was now slowly coming to an end under the night wind and thunder.
1:15:56|1:16:3|Upon hearing the gunshot, Ye Lei quickly arrived at the platform, confirmed that Kana had died, and then looked towards Ye Feng on the opposite side.
1:16:3|1:16:23|[Ye Feng] dragged his heavy body out of the cover, with his left hand holding the gun and his right hand slowly raised high, palm facing the opponent, thumb, index finger, and little finger raised one after another, mimicking the shooting gesture that [Ye Lei] had just shown him. [Ye Lei] also raised his gun in response, the two of them separated by the platform, as if they had returned to the time when they were carrying out their mission.
1:16:24|1:16:31|The mission completed, a military jeep carrying [Ye Feng] and [Ye Lei] returned to the military base on You Island.
1:16:31|1:16:47|At this moment, all the soldiers in the camp band are waiting for the arrival of the plane carrying [Ye Feng] and [Ye Lei]. The five stars rise together, the military flags flutter, and the silent warriors quietly protect the country's security. After the car stops, [Ye Feng] and [Ye Lei] get out of the car.
1:17:14|1:17:50|After hiding for a long time, [Ye Lei] finally returned to the army. The two saluted each other again, then turned around and walked back. When they returned to the team, the captain spoke. After the captain gave the order, he took off his military cap with both hands, and all comrades also followed suit. Everyone's actions were surprisingly consistent. The captain took a step forward, then turned to look at the neatly folded military flag, paying tribute to our fallen comrades.
1:17:50|1:18:8|After hearing the password, everyone's faces turned solemn. The sacrifice of their comrades caused great sorrow to all. They put on their military caps and bid farewell. The captain looked around and began to speak.
1:19:8|1:19:17|Amidst the applause, [Ye Lei] did his best and after two years of undercover work, he finally completed the mission excellently.
1:19:17|1:19:33|In China, there are countless individuals like him, in the blue skies of the motherland, on the rivers and seas, on the border walls, in peacekeeping camps, unafraid of harsh environments, facing difficulties and dangers without fear, silently carrying out duties and missions, selflessly dedicating their youth and lives without regret.
1:19:37|1:19:54|On a sunny afternoon, [Ye Feng] in camouflage attire appears on an observation deck. Far away from the city, a gentle breeze blows, causing the plants to sway in unison. [Ye Feng] leans against the railing, gazing into the distance, taking in the cityscape below.
1:19:54|1:20:3|[Ye Feng] walked slowly towards the railing, finally stopping next to [Ye Lei], standing silently. [Ye Lei] felt [Ye Feng]'s presence and turned to look at him.
1:20:5|1:20:24|[Ye Lei] dressed in casual clothes, highlighting his figure. The determined expression on his face, with his thick and thin eyebrows tightly furrowed. With a heavy heart, he seemed to recall the sacrifice of Xiao Lu, perhaps a sacrificed comrade. In the end, [Ye Lei] smiled in resignation, letting all thoughts drift away with the wind. Two years ago,
1:20:38|1:20:58|The bullet, which had been through two years, still had faint traces of blood on it. It witnessed the entire process of [Ye Feng]'s revenge. [Ye Lei] took the bullet from [Ye Feng]'s hand, and time seemed to go back to the jungle where the two fought. [Ye Lei] released his fingers, and the bullet slipped from the air, falling into the deep valley ahead.
1:20:58|1:21:1|Ye Feng's expression was initially puzzled, then turned into a smile of resignation.
1:21:3|1:21:13|[Ye Lei] also smiled in response, and the two patted each other's shoulders. This is the camaraderie between comrades, not adding flowers to brocade, but giving charcoal in the snow.
1:21:13|1:21:27|After experiencing several life-threatening crises, [Ye Feng] and [Huang Shilong] have returned to the tranquility of the past. They gaze into the distance, where lies the place they have been guarding day and night, dedicating their youth without regrets for the security of the country.
