0:0:22|0:0:39|The story begins in a luxurious mansion, where the overweight host Wang Bo is sitting on a single sofa studying English. The beautiful female tutor Wang Li is sitting opposite him, conducting the lesson. Meanwhile, the imposing mansion owner is carrying a medicine bottle downstairs.
0:2:2|0:2:11|The male protagonist bent over to wave goodbye to his wife. The female nanny [Lan Lan] ran over in an apron, and the male protagonist called her aside.
0:2:29|0:2:40|[Lan Lan] ran away cheerfully, and the male host turned to look at the female tutor [Wang Li] with lustful thoughts.
0:3:0|0:3:14|The male lead pushes [Wang Li] into the bedroom and presses her on the bed. [Wang Li] resists at first but then playfully wrestles with him on the bed. The bedroom door is wide open, and in the nearby bathroom, a camera clearly captures everything happening in the bedroom.
0:3:14|0:3:29|A man with extremely sharp hair sits in the bathtub, drinking whiskey and watching the footage on the camera. He turns his head to look out the window, then picks up the camera placed on the edge of the bathtub and walks into the bedroom with a smile. The host lies on top of [Wang Li], completely stunned.
0:4:10|0:4:18|The male protagonist, Wang Bo, lay on the bed unable to speak for half a day.
0:4:49|0:4:51|The three of them then arrived outdoors.
0:5:12|0:5:15|Mr. Liu lifts the towel covering [Wang Li]'s head.
0:5:24|0:5:29|Wang Li's companion stood up, patted his pants, and then sat back down next to Mr. Liu.
0:5:39|0:5:42|[Wang Li] glanced outside.
0:6:10|0:6:16|[Wang Li] gave Mr. Liu a slap and then walked away. Mr. Liu was stunned, his glasses even fell below his nose.
0:6:31|0:6:45|[Wang Li]'s companion, Wang Bo, touched General Liu's face tenderly. General Liu remained silent, his chubby face full of grievances. After a while, a BMW drove out of the mansion, and the security guard standing next to the large iron gate saluted in the direction of the car.
0:6:45|0:6:56|The BMW drove out for a while, then reversed back to the security guard. The driver's side window slowly rolled down, and [Wang Bo] smiled as he leaned out and spoke with his left arm resting on the window.
0:7:6|0:7:10|The security guard was a bit flustered, and [Wang Bo] reached out and patted the car door.
0:7:26|0:7:36|Wang Bo saw that Wang Li's face didn't look good, muttered a few words, and then left. The security guard silently saluted with a puzzled expression. On the road, Wang Bo drove while reaching out to pat Wang Li.
0:7:40|0:7:56|[Wang Li] kept looking out the car window, shook her head, then lowered it to pull out a CD and put it into the car's drive. Melodious music started playing, [Wang Bo] didn't say anything more, just smiled at [Wang Li]. The two of them, driving the extorted luxury car, set off on their journey.
0:7:56|0:8:9|They went to many places, from desolate deserts to picturesque canyons, towering ice mountains, and endless grasslands. [Wang Li] seemed to become somewhat silent, often sitting in the car lost in thought, sometimes staring blankly.
0:8:10|0:8:28|When [Wang Bo] notices his lover feeling unwell, he always covers her with a coat first, then hugs her from behind to comfort her. [Wang Li] reciprocates with a kiss, full of worries but unable to express them. The story is about to unfold from here.
0:8:28|0:8:35|This film is a drama directed by Feng Xiaogang, starring Andy Lau, Liu Ruoying, Ge You, Wang Baoqiang, and [Wang Bo].
0:8:35|0:8:50|Based on the novel of the same name by Zhao Benfu, the film mainly tells the story of a pair of thief partners who, in order to fulfill the wish of a laborer named Shagen for "No Thieves in the World," engage in a series of fierce battles with another group of thieves on a train.
0:8:51|0:9:5|Male thief [Wang Bo] and female thief [Wang Li] are a pair of climbing partners in theft, as well as fugitive lovers. The two set a trap in a woman's house, and after a series of threats, they stole the host's BMW car, then traveled to the west to sell the car.
0:9:5|0:9:9|[Wang Li] discovers that she is pregnant and wants to break away from this stagnant life.
0:9:10|0:9:22|But out of shame for their identities as thieves, it made him doubt whether he and [Wang Bo] could be good parents, so he was feeling very conflicted. [Wang Bo] was clueless about these thoughts, leading to several conflicts between the two on the way.
0:9:22|0:9:34|On the train back to the city, Wang Bo and Wang Li met a migrant worker named Sha Gen, who had earned a sum of money working in the west and wanted to use it to build a house and get married in his hometown. Sha Gen, who didn't believe there were thieves in the world, insisted on taking the money with him on the road.
0:9:34|0:9:52|[Wang Li] was deeply touched by Sha Gen's simplicity due to a brief encounter they had, and decided to protect Sha Gen and the money in his bag to fulfill his dream of a world without thieves. However, there was another gang on the car who wanted to steal Sha Gen's money. Therefore, [Wang Bo] and [Wang Li] engaged in a series of fierce battles with this gang.
0:9:52|0:10:11|In the film, the male thief Wang Bo is played by Andy Lau, and the female thief [Wang Li] is played by Rene Liu. The construction worker Sha Gen is played by Wang Baoqiang, the leader of the theft gang Uncle Li is played by Ge You, and Uncle Li's female subordinate Xiao Ye is played by Li Bingbing. The film won the Best Adapted Screenplay Award at the 42nd Golden Horse Awards in Taiwan in 2005.
0:10:11|0:10:21|The 5th Chinese Film Media Awards for Best Actress and the Centennial Media Tribute Film Award were released in mainland China on December 9, 2004.
0:10:22|0:10:35|Continuing with the main part of the film. [Wang Bo] parked the car in an open field and went down alone to think. [Wang Li], wrapped in a coat and scarf, curled up in the back seat, unable to stop retching, obviously being severely troubled by morning sickness.
0:10:44|0:10:48|[Wang Li] slowly pushed herself away from the back of the seat while speaking weakly, lifting her head with no energy.
0:10:49|0:11:9|He stared at [Wang Bo] without blinking, hoping to hear what he wanted from the other's mouth. However, [Wang Bo] just looked at him with a cigarette in his mouth, raised a lighter without saying a word, lit the cigarette in his mouth, took a deep drag, exhaled smoke, and sighed.
0:11:13|0:11:29|[Wang Bo] was full of foul language, while [Wang Li] lifted her leg and fiercely kicked the driver's seat. She glared at [Wang Bo], rolled her eyes, then retreated to the corner. She raised her right hand wearing a lacy glove, adjusted the scarf wrapped around her head, curled up again in silence, and didn't speak anymore.
0:11:29|0:11:32|[Wang Bo] was kicked by [Wang Li], causing him to tremble and slowly retract his gaze.
0:11:32|0:11:51|Leaning against the driver's seat, Wang Bo took two deep puffs of his cigarette, then opened the car door and threw the remaining long stub of the cigarette onto the ground. He extended his left leg out of the car, forcefully stomped on the ground with his foot clad in brand new leather shoes, then stepped on the gas pedal and sped off into the distance. The car gradually disappeared, leaving only the occasional flickering of the taillights in the distance.
0:11:51|0:11:58|The pitch-black dusk gradually transformed into the face of a Buddha in front of everyone, giving rise to a sense of solemnity and reverence.
0:11:59|0:12:3|The title "无贼" appears in the center of the screen, following the movie "A World Without Thieves".
0:12:19|0:12:34|[Wang Bo] and [Wang Li], after a long journey, finally arrived at their destination, Tibet. They parked the car on the road and suddenly saw a dazzling light shining through the clouds, illuminating the buildings at the foot of the mountain, like a Buddha's light shining on them, which was amazing.
0:12:49|0:12:51|Wang Li's face is filled with seriousness.
0:12:56|0:13:10|[Wang Bo] dropped him off on the main street and disappeared. [Wang Li] arrived alone outside a building, which was a temple still under renovation. The temple gate had not been installed yet, temporarily covered by a huge piece of cloth, with countless iron frames surrounding the sides of the gate.
0:13:10|0:13:19|The whole temple seems to have just been built, the windows have not been installed yet. There are ladders placed on the side of the temple, and workers are constantly carrying plastic buckets or other containers up.
0:13:19|0:13:35|[Wang Li] knelt devoutly outside the door, hands clasped together in front of his chest, eyes tightly closed, murmuring words silently. He bowed forward, then stood up, opened his eyes, and continued to kneel outside the temple praying. Occasionally, two or three pedestrians passed by behind him, the scene was very desolate.
0:13:35|0:13:49|Not far to the right, on a shelf, a young man wearing a winter hat is wearing a watch, holding a basin of strange paint, and painting patterns on a square wooden stake protruding from the eaves. As he painted, he accidentally looked down and saw Wang Li kneeling below.
0:13:50|0:14:7|Bowing repeatedly in front of the Buddha, he seemed to be attracted by the other party, not even noticing the paint dripping from the brush in his hand onto the ground. Meanwhile, [Wang Bo] who had left [Wang Li] alone, came to the bustling corridor of the temple, which was obviously a very popular attraction with many foreigners visiting.
0:14:7|0:14:16|[Wang Bo] walked forward with a smile on his face, holding a camera in his right hand and looking at the screen. Suddenly, he reached into the pocket of his chest and took out a small piece of blade into his palm with his left hand.
0:14:16|0:14:34|As he walked, he casually opened the backpack of a man next to him. A leather wallet fell out from the bottom of the backpack. Huang Bo raised his hand and caught it skillfully. His smile grew bigger and bigger. The next second, he opened another person's bag and a palm-sized metal box fell out. Right before it hit the ground, he kicked it with force.
0:14:34|0:14:48|The box flew up in an instant and landed right in his hand. [Wang Bo] raised the box and shook it, leaving a little boy nearby with his mouth wide open in astonishment. Outside the temple corridor, a young woman with disheveled hair and wearing a loose cloak walked into the crowd of worshippers.
0:14:48|0:14:56|He forcefully lifted his cloak, and in the moment of kneeling down, swiftly opened the nearby person's small bag, then instantly took out the other party's phone and placed it in his palm.
0:14:57|0:15:13|Every move of the young woman was seen by [Wang Bo]. She turned around, knelt down, knocked her head against the temple, then stood up and walked back. Just as she passed by the young woman, she casually stole back the phone that the other party had stolen, and even greeted her face to face.
0:15:13|0:15:27|[Wang Bo] then left the temple and sat in a corner to rest. He opened the stolen iron box and shared the candies inside with a group of children. After finishing their prayers, [Wang Bo] and [Wang Li] set off on their journey again. [Wang Bo] whistled while driving, and couldn't help but burst into laughter.
0:15:27|0:15:31|He then raised a bag and threw it to [Wang Li], which was filled with cell phones.
0:16:3|0:16:9|The two got into a dispute, with [Wang Li] angrily pulling [Wang Bo] and reaching out to grab the steering wheel.
0:16:9|0:16:27|The small car that was originally driving straight on the road started to wobble. Just as the two were struggling, a big truck with the Great Wall lubricant logo on its body came towards them. As the two vehicles were about to collide, the truck driver widened his eyes, turned the steering wheel sharply, and successfully swerved past them.
0:16:27|0:16:31|[Wang Bo] then stopped the motorcycle by the roadside. [Wang Bo] had an angry look on his face.
0:16:36|0:16:43|He cursed while opening the car door and glanced at [Wang Li], whose eyes were slightly red. He stared at [Wang Bo] for a moment, then turned back and said.
0:16:51|0:17:9|[Wang Bo] looked a bit puzzled, his lips slightly parted as he turned to look at [Wang Li]. He saw tears welling up in her eyes as she stared at him without blinking. Feeling unsure, he remained silent, pursed his lips, swallowed nervously, and after a moment of contemplation, agreed.
0:17:36|0:17:52|Facing Wang Bo's denial, Wang Li immediately raised her hand and forcefully pulled open her coat and the shirt inside, revealing a round scar on the right side of her chest. With a face full of grievance, she glared fiercely at Wang Bo, but still stubbornly controlled herself from shedding tears.
0:17:52|0:18:3|[Wang Bo] was a bit excited at this moment. He took two deep breaths, inhaling and exhaling forcefully, but tears still couldn't help but fall. He forced a smile, wiped away the tears, and sneered.
0:18:23|0:18:35|[Wang Bo] chuckled, shook his head, and pulled out a bank card from his pocket, tossing it into [Wang Li]'s handbag. Without hesitation, he put away the bank card, opened the door, got out of the car, wrapped in a scarf, and walked away without looking back.
0:18:35|0:18:50|He walked resolutely, while [Wang Bo]'s car remained stationary for a long time before slowly catching up with [Wang Li]. He controlled the steering wheel while turning his head to the right, trying to attract her attention. However, she didn't even look at him and kept walking faster.
0:18:50|0:18:54|[Wang Bo] had no choice but to lower his posture and apologize to make amends.
0:19:1|0:19:5|In the other side of the alley, a young man riding a bicycle suddenly asked.
0:19:17|0:19:33|The young man evaded the old man's questions, suddenly lowered his head and smiled, then quickly suppressed the smile and left the alley with the old man. On the road, [Wang Li] was already exhausted, she weakly looked up at the sky, and then limped forward.
0:19:33|0:19:39|Seeing a motorcycle approaching, [Wang Li] hurriedly stepped forward to stop it, but the other party completely ignored her.
0:20:7|0:20:22|The young man who just asked about his age and is about to use money to build a house and get married, also known as Sha Gen. At this moment, on the road where [Wang Li] is located, a group of people riding bicycles passed by. [Wang Li] saw them and hurriedly approached for help again, but still no one paid attention to her.
0:20:22|0:20:36|She stood on a small hill, took a few quick steps, saw Shagen turn around, hurriedly waved at her, but Shagen did not stop, instead followed the uncles and left together. [Wang Li] was somewhat disappointed, she bent down slightly, panting wearily, then shouted and sat down on the ground.
0:20:38|0:20:55|Hearing someone shouting, Shagen, who had already left, kept looking back repeatedly, and eventually chose to ride back to where [Wang Li] was. At this moment, [Wang Li] was sitting on the ground with a full sense of loss, her hands weakly resting on her legs, a few messy strands of hair scattered on her face, highlighting a sense of exhaustion.
0:20:55|0:21:4|Just as [Wang Li] was at a loss, she inadvertently looked up and saw the young man [Sha Gen], who should have left, appearing not far away, waving at her.
0:21:5|0:21:22|He followed [Shagen] to the bicycle, took Shagen's water bottle and wiped his mouth with it without saying a word. After drinking a bottle of water, he wiped his mouth contentedly, looked up at Shagen, who was smiling foolishly with his mouth covered, and pulled down the scarf wrapped around his head with a smile.
0:21:22|0:21:25|Long embroidered hair cascaded down, [Wang Bo] shyly lowered his head.
0:21:50|0:22:2|Upon hearing [Wang Bo]'s words, [Wang Li] fell silent and sat on the back seat of [Wang Bo]'s bicycle, lost in thought. After a while, [Wang Bo] stopped the bicycle by the roadside. [Wang Li] got off the back seat and took out a banknote from her pocket, handing it to [Wang Bo].
0:22:2|0:22:11|[Shagen] holds the bicycle with both hands and looks at [Wang Li]. [Wang Li] directly hands the money to [Shagen].
0:22:13|0:22:30|Watching [Shagen] ride away on his bike, [Wang Li] turned around to leave. Just as she took a few steps, she heard some noise behind her. She stopped and looked back, only to see [Shagen] riding back on his bike. He stopped the bike in front of [Wang Li], got off, and took a rope from around his neck to hand it to her.
0:22:37|0:22:53|[Shagen] handed the chain to [Wang Li] and then rode away again. [Wang Li] watched [Shagen] leave, then looked down at the chain in her hand, which had a pendant of a demon-slaying staff in the center. Later, [Shagen] arrived outside a courtyard wall, sat on the ground, and had a meal with everyone.
0:22:53|0:23:3|The former accountant walked over with a cloth bag. Inside the bag was the money that [Wang Bo] wanted to use to build a house and get married.
0:23:54|0:24:2|Shagen completely ignored the advice and came to a grassland alone at night, shouting as he walked forward.
0:24:42|0:25:0|After bidding farewell to [Lang Qun], [Shagen] left. The next day, in the VIP room at the train station, an old man with white beard sat with his eyes closed on the central sofa, while a man with glasses sat beside him skillfully playing with a coin. A chubby man wearing a duckbill cap pushed the door open and walked towards them.
0:25:31|0:25:38|The man with glasses glared angrily at the woman, who remained silent. She suddenly stood up and sat next to the old man with a white beard, who is [Uncle Li].
0:26:34|0:26:55|Saying that, [Uncle Li] forcefully swung his hand, directly throwing the watch on his wrist onto Siyan's wrist. Siyan was somewhat surprised. In the waiting room on the other side, a man in a leather jacket was drawing a portrait. [Wang Bo] walked through the crowd and handed him a glass of water.
0:27:10|0:27:27|[Wang Bo] had a look of concern on his face, while [Wang Li] remained silent. As the train was about to depart, [Wang Bo] helped [Wang Li] out of the rear carriage. At the same time, [Uncle Li] and his group of four also emerged from the VIP compartment. When [Wang Bo] looked up, he saw the woman Xiao Ye whom he had previously encountered at the temple gate.
0:27:27|0:27:30|Just as they exchanged greetings, they heard someone shouting loudly not far away.
0:27:43|0:28:2|As soon as the words fell, Uncle Li and [Wang Bo] and [Wang Li] turned to look at him. Ah, Sha Gen stood in the crowd shouting non-stop, and the people next to him began to walk onto the train one after another. The coworkers who came to see Sha Gen off were also speechless at his behavior, not knowing what to say. At this moment, [Wang Li] also recognized him.
0:28:42|0:28:54|[Wang Li] suddenly turned around and pointed at [Wang Bo]'s nose with the ticket in his hand. [Wang Bo] quickly shook his head and climbed onto the train first. The silly root who saw an empty seat hurriedly moved his luggage bag onto the table and turned to greet [Wang Li] and [Wang Bo].
0:29:21|0:29:29|Teacher Han, who was the leather-jacketed man that Wang Bo stole the wallet from in the back hall before, tried to sit down, only to be directly rejected by Wang Bo.
0:29:32|0:29:48|Teacher Han had no choice but to sit on the other side of the aisle. Seeing the other person sit down, [Wang Bo] and [Wang Li] then stood up to take off their coats and scarves. Just as [Wang Bo] stood up to put his clothes on the luggage rack, Uncle Li, leaning on a cane, walked unsteadily over and stood behind [Wang Bo], speaking.
0:30:8|0:30:15|[Wang Bo] supported Uncle Li to the connection of the carriage, closed the door casually, crossed his hands and leaned against the wall, quietly watching Uncle Li perform.
0:30:45|0:30:51|[Wang Bo] snorted coldly, returned to the carriage alone, the train started officially, and people all sat in their own seats.
0:31:30|0:31:47|[Wang Bo] looked at Sha Gen, helplessly reached out and patted his shoulder. [Wang Bo] turned his head with emotion and glanced at [Wang Li].
0:31:53|0:31:55|[Wang Li] drinks water while glaring at [Wang Bo].
0:32:17|0:32:34|You look like a Bodhisattva to everyone, but it's useless. [Wang Bo] mocked Shagen while holding a cup, [Wang Li] looked at the dumbfounded Shagen with some reluctance, then turned her head and glared at [Wang Bo].
0:33:18|0:33:32|Seeing Shagen's naive look, [Wang Bo] didn't know what to say. Shagen turned his head to ask [Wang Bo], but [Wang Bo] had his eyes closed, whether he was really asleep or pretending to be asleep. The truck continued to move forward, and Li returned to the luxurious sleeper compartment.
0:33:52|0:33:54|Uncle Li removes his makeup while answering Fatty.
0:34:37|0:34:56|The fat man on the sofa stood up directly and started fighting with Xiao Ye. Xiao Ye fought back, leaving several scratches on [Wang Bo]'s face. When Uncle Li spoke up, the two had to stop. Xiao Ye's middle finger was almost cut off by [Wang Bo], so he withdrew his left hand and was poked on the head by [Wang Bo] a few times.
0:35:14|0:35:31|Xiaoye sat on the bed, combing her hair, and then got up. Seeing Wang Bo walk out, Xiaoye rolled her eyes and walked to Uncle Li to help him massage his shoulders.
0:35:49|0:35:57|Wang Bo, who was originally sitting in the carriage, is now carrying his bag and going to the toilet alone. Just as he comes out of the restroom, he is splashed with boiling water by someone across from him.
0:36:2|0:36:14|Shagen was scalded and took a step back, bumping directly into [Fatty]. [Fatty] pushed him away, throwing the bag that was originally hanging in front of him behind. Siyan, who was about to search the bag, was held down by [Wang Bo] who came over.
0:36:14|0:36:22|He locked eyes with Siyan, then stood in place and started pushing each other with hands. [Wang Bo] blocked Siyan's attacks while quietly putting his index finger to his lips.
0:36:24|0:36:39|Watching the humiliating smile on [Wang Bo]'s face, Siyan became angry. He flicked a blade from his sleeve and slid it towards [Wang Bo's] hand. Without any hesitation, [Wang Bo] lightly twisted his wrist to dodge the attack. Siyan's assault became more fierce, and in the blink of an eye, [Wang Bo] also had a blade in his hand.
0:36:39|0:36:52|The chubby guy next to him still controlled Sha Gen, and under the pretext of helping Sha Gen check his injuries, he handed the bag from Sha Gen's backpack to Si Yan. [Wang Bo] turned his head and saw [Wang Li] walking towards him, snatched the backpack and threw it over, then pushed Sha Gen over as well.
0:36:55|0:37:21|[Wang Bo] hung the bag back on Sha Gen's neck. Seeing the police approaching, the fat guy hugged [Wang Bo] and Si Yan, pretending to be intimate. As soon as the police left, he immediately changed his expression. The fat guy pushed [Wang Bo] away, [Wang Bo] was stunned for a moment, then suddenly smiled.
0:37:29|0:37:50|Shagen laughed foolishly and took out the money. [Wang Bo] then took out a can of ointment from his bag and applied some with his fingers. Wang Li reached out and applied some ointment under Shagen's neck.
0:37:56|0:38:12|[Shagen] obediently lifted his head for [Wang Li] to apply medicine for him. [Wang Li] helped him apply some medicine on his neck and near his chin, then tilted his head back to blow on the reddened skin. [Wang Bo] sat across without saying a word, but smiled as he watched [Wang Li], reminiscing about the sweet past.
0:38:14|0:38:22|He recalled that before their argument, they had embraced and passionately kissed on the boat. These memories were deeply imprinted in his mind.
0:38:46|0:39:3|Wang Li saw Wang Bo misbehaving and gave him a slap on the butt. The city clerk started selling boxed meals, and across the aisle, Teacher Han heard the commotion and prepared to pay. He patted his pockets front and back, but found nothing.
0:39:23|0:39:28|After speaking, [Wang Bo] took an egg from the bag, and [Wang Li], who heard the noise, couldn't sit still again.
0:39:42|0:39:58|Wang Bo was holding an egg to give to Teacher Han, but was pulled back by [Wang Li]. Wang Bo, who had the egg, left the carriage and, led by the attendant, arrived at the upscale dining car on the train. In front of the attendant, Wang Bo made the egg disappear and then reappear.
0:40:11|0:40:16|[Wang Bo] crossed over Xiao Ye and Uncle Li, sat in the seat behind them, and then put down what he was holding.
0:40:23|0:40:43|Wang Bo spins a cup with an egg in it in the air while shaking it. He rests his left elbow on the table, continuously shaking the cup, with a growing smile on his face. Xiao Ye and Uncle Li sit in the back, silently watching him show off his skills, in the blink of an eye.
0:40:43|0:40:58|Suddenly, some small eggshells fell along the cup's wall into the ashtray above the table, and the eggshells in the cup became fewer and fewer, until one peeled egg remained intact in the cup. [Wang Bo] poured the egg onto a plate, set the cup aside, and took a few bites of the egg.
0:40:58|0:41:3|At the same time, Uncle Li stood up with a glass of wine and sat down across from [Wang Bo].
0:41:20|0:41:26|After speaking, [Wang Bo] smiled, Uncle Li remained silent, and Xiao Ye, who was still in place, suddenly sat next to Uncle Li and handed him an egg.
0:41:28|0:41:43|Uncle Li took the egg from Xiao Ye's hand, raised his hand and made the egg spin rapidly between his ring finger and thumb. His index finger controlled a blade, shaving off the eggshell as it spun. In the blink of an eye, it was shaved clean, and Wang Bo's smile gradually disappeared.
0:41:46|0:42:0|Uncle Li placed the peeled raw egg in the palm of his left hand, then raised his right hand, discarded the eggshell left in his hand, pinched the egg with both hands, placed it above a glass of beer, and gently squeezed to break the eggshell, allowing the egg liquid to mix with the beer in the glass.
0:42:12|0:42:16|[Wang Bo] turned his head to look at Siyan and Fatty eating at the next table.
0:42:52|0:42:54|Uncle Li glanced at Fatso and Four Eyes.
0:43:19|0:43:37|Uncle Li then returned to the sleeper compartment and slapped Four Eyes as soon as he entered. Blood trickled from the corner of Four Eyes' mouth, and he refused to turn his head. Fatty became a little anxious at the sight.
0:43:53|0:44:5|Siyan knelt beside Uncle Li, glaring defiantly with his eyes. Uncle Li looked at him, suddenly smiled, then sighed again.
0:44:10|0:44:12|Uncle Li's expression changed in an instant. Uncle Li's expression changed in an instant.
0:44:42|0:44:49|The fat guy hesitated for a moment, looked down at Siyan, and then obediently knelt down next to Siyan. Uncle Li spoke to Siyan.
0:45:0|0:45:12|On the other side, Sha Gen finished using the restroom, tidied up his pants, and called out to [Wang Bo]. Sha Gen patted [Wang Bo]'s arm, and [Wang Bo] looked at Sha Gen with tears in his eyes.
0:45:22|0:45:38|[Wang Bo] said nothing, bypassed Sha Gen, and walked to the car window to look outside. Sha Gen hurriedly caught up and anxiously asked. Only then did [Wang Bo] slowly speak, chokingly.
0:46:26|0:46:34|[Wang Bo] performed with great sincerity, crying with tears and snot flowing. Listening to [Wang Bo]'s words, Wang Li also cried.
0:47:5|0:47:8|[Wang Bo] gasped for breath while placing his hand on Sha Gen's shoulder.
0:47:25|0:47:27|The scene then cuts to the luxurious sleeper compartment of Uncle Li.
0:48:13|0:48:35|The fat guy was still kneeling on the ground, expressing his dissatisfaction to Uncle Li. As he spoke, he picked up a metal tool with a blade from the table next to him. Uncle Li turned his head to look at him but didn't say anything. On the other side, [Wang Bo] returned to his seat with a silly expression.
0:48:40|0:48:51|Wang Li was a bit skeptical of him. Sha Gen looked out the car window without saying a word. He turned his head to look at Wang Li.
0:48:52|0:49:1|[Wang Li] looked at Sha Gen's unnatural smile, turned her head, and stared at [Wang Bo] with a suspicious look. [Wang Bo] avoided her gaze and poked Sha Gen's leg with his hand.
0:49:27|0:49:51|Listening to Shagen's singing, [Wang Li] finally smiled and started singing along. Shortly after, [Wang Bo] also joined in. The other people in the car were all drawn to the singing, some sticking their heads out to watch, while others pointed to their heads, pursed their lips, indicating that the singers were a bit crazy.
0:49:51|0:49:54|Shagen suddenly couldn't continue singing.
0:50:0|0:50:5|Shagen lowered his head, and [Wang Bo] suddenly spoke as he looked at him.
0:50:31|0:50:44|[Wang Bo] glanced at [Wang Li], then followed Sha Gen out of the carriage. [Wang Li] turned her head to look at the backs of the two of them, not sure what they were up to. Sha Gen and [Wang Bo] walked out of the carriage one after the other, arriving at the connecting point.
0:50:44|0:50:58|Sha Gen walked to the car window, leaned back, and started searching in the bag. [Wang Bo] casually closed the car door, stood opposite Sha Gen, and watched him take out a stack of money. Instead of taking the money, [Wang Bo] put his hand on Sha Gen's shoulder.
0:51:1|0:51:7|Wang Bo looked at [Sha Gen] in a daze, then tightly held [Sha Gen]'s hand holding the money.
0:51:36|0:51:53|He was saying no with his mouth, but showed no sign of avoidance when [Shagen] was stuffing money into his pocket, with a triumphant smile on his face. After Shagen finished, he returned to the carriage, [Wang Bo] sensed something was wrong, walked to the window and questioned Wang Bo, who directly took out a stack of banknotes from his pocket.
0:52:27|0:52:32|After speaking, [Wang Li] walked to the side, but Wang Po didn't respond, only focused on counting money with her head down.
0:52:47|0:53:1|[Wang Bo] snatched the money from [Wang Li]'s hand and walked back. [Wang Bo] looked at the suddenly furious [Wang Li], feeling that the other party was inexplicably angry, and he also had a lot of pent-up anger that hadn't been triggered. He glanced at [Wang Li]'s back, then turned and leaned against the wall, feeling upset himself.
0:53:1|0:53:9|[Wang Bo] then returned to the carriage and sat across from [Wang Li], looking at him without saying a word for a long time. [Wang Li] lifted his head to meet [Wang Bo]'s gaze, and soon tears started to fall.
0:53:10|0:53:27|The eyes revealed an indescribable sadness. [Wang Li] then sat up straight, leaned forward, and forced a smile. Sha Gen seemed to have something to say and also sat up straight and leaned forward. Watching Sha Gen cry silently, [Wang Li]'s heart softened a lot, and her own eyes turned red.
0:53:27|0:53:33|With a soft sigh, [Wang Bo] turned to [Wang Li] and said.
0:53:46|0:54:0|After speaking, she returned the money to Sha Gen.
0:54:6|0:54:9|[Wang Li] gently patted Sha Gen's face with her hand.
0:54:15|0:54:25|[Wang Li] nodded earnestly at Sha Gen, one hand touching her face, the other hand wiping away her tears. The train had been running on the tracks for a long time, and the sky had completely darkened.
0:54:25|0:54:35|Uncle Li, wearing a coat and waving a torch, walked down the corridor of the luxurious sleeper car. As he walked, he used his hand to press on the metal tool with a blade that the fat man had once held.
0:54:36|0:54:52|He recalled the way Fatty used to look, pulled back the curtain in front of him and looked out of the window. [Wang Li] suddenly emerged from the sleeper compartment. He raised one hand and placed it on Uncle Li's left shoulder, then leaned slowly against it. Uncle Li raised his right hand and patted [Wang Li]'s hand, sighing casually.
0:55:4|0:55:8|[Wang Li] handed a glass of wine to Uncle Li, and then gave him a strong pat on the back.
0:55:15|0:55:19|[Wang Li] didn't speak, but lay on the bed and sat up to stretch her legs.
0:55:24|0:55:27|Uncle Li licked the wine spilled on his hand and sat down to speak.
0:55:51|0:56:6|Uncle Li leaned back in his chair, his face inscrutable. After listening to Uncle Li's words, [Wang Li] walked out of the luxurious sleeper car alone and entered the compartment where Sha Gen was. At that moment, [Wang Bo] was washing his face in the bathroom, completely unaware that Xiao Ye had walked past him.
0:56:6|0:56:17|In the carriage, most people were already dozing off, leaning against the back of the seat. [Wang Li] was also leaning against the back of the seat with her eyes closed. [Xiao Ye] slowly walked to the middle of the carriage and sat down sideways in a position close to [Sha Gen].
0:56:18|0:56:31|She observed her surroundings calmly while skillfully twirling a delicate lighter between her fingertips. Hearing some movement beside her, [Wang Li] slowly opened her eyes, glanced lightly at her, tugged at her clothes, and then closed her eyes again to sleep.
0:56:31|0:56:43|[Ye Xiaoye] then took out a cigarette, put it in his mouth, lit it, and took out a lipstick from his pocket. He used the cigarette to burn the surface of the lipstick, pushed the lit part up, and flicked it directly into the pocket of a middle-aged man's military coat not far away.
0:56:45|0:56:56|A white smoke suddenly emerged from Wang Bo's coat pocket, and as the smoke thickened and the choking smell spread, the entire train compartment quickly became filled with smoke.
0:56:56|0:57:10|The middle-aged man wearing a Jun coat suddenly woke up choking on smoke. He opened his eyes in confusion and realized that the thick smoke was coming from his Jun coat. Panicked, he struggled to get up and yanked off the Jun coat, causing the female passenger next to him to scream.
0:57:14|0:57:32|[Wang Bo] heard the commotion and stood up to go out and help. [Wang Li] took advantage of the chaos to cover a large piece of cloth over [Wang Bo]'s head, and [Teacher Han] also joined in. In the blink of an eye, [Wang Bo]'s money was stolen by [Wang Li].
0:57:34|0:57:52|[Wang Li] stepped on the chair, pulled the cloth covering [Wang Bo]'s head down, and quickly walked to check her bag from behind. The money inside, wrapped in kraft paper, had already been replaced with a large pack of tissues. She angrily dragged [Wang Bo] back to her seat.
0:57:52|0:58:2|Just then, two police officers ran over with fire extinguishers, passing by Xiao Ye who had just stolen money from [Wang Bo]. The police ran into the carriage, about to open the fire extinguisher, but were stopped by Teacher Han.
0:58:10|0:58:26|Beside, Wang Li opened the car window. [Wang Li] ran backwards while looking around for the figure of [Wang Bo]. From behind, the police could be heard asking the passenger whose clothes were on fire if it was put out by smoking coal, faintly hearing the passenger reply that he had quit smoking for ten years.
0:58:26|0:58:37|[Wang Li] walked into a regular residential area and suddenly saw a woman who looked exactly like Xiao Ye in both dress and hairstyle climbing up the stairs. [Wang Li] directly pulled the other person down, only to realize that she had mistaken the person.
0:58:43|0:58:53|The woman was being quite persistent, but Xiao Ye, disguised as a pregnant woman, managed to pass by. As soon as she stepped out of the sleeper car, her wig was snatched off by [Wang Bo] standing at the door.
0:58:57|0:59:14|Xiaoye reached for the wig while pulling out a hairpin from her hair with the other hand, stabbing towards [Wang Bo]. The two started fighting at the connection between the train cars. [Wang Bo] ran behind Xiaoye and subdued her, narrowly avoiding getting the sharp end of the hairpin in his head.
0:59:14|0:59:24|Xiaoye casually shook the hairpin, and the decoration on the other end suddenly cracked open, turning into a small knife with a blade. [Wang Bo] held her waist with one hand and held her arm with the other, trying to avoid the hairpin in the opponent's hand.
0:59:24|0:59:35|During the fight, even the sunglasses fell off. Seizing the opportunity, [Wang Bo] skillfully sliced open Xiao Ye's clothes from the chest, revealing the wrapped package. [Wang Bo] then took the chance to catch it.
0:59:35|0:59:44|Xiaoye's clothes were torn open, revealing his underwear. He wrapped his clothes around himself and kicked towards [Wang Bo], who then suddenly pushed Xiaoye into the corner.
0:59:49|1:0:17|During the banter, [Wang Bo] suddenly changed his expression, he hugged Xiaoye lightly, and a policeman passing by saw the two kissing in the corner and interrupted them. After the policeman left, [Wang Bo] had just stood up when Xiaoye immediately pulled him back and he smiled as he opened Xiaoye's torn clothes.
1:0:27|1:0:43|Xiao Ye pushed [Wang Bo] away, rolled her eyes, and walked towards the carriage behind her. [Wang Bo] watched Xiao Ye's departing figure, raised his hand to close the carriage door, then took out a plastic bag, wrapped the snatched leather paper inside, tied a knot, and prepared to leave. Just as he turned around, he bumped into [Wang Li].
1:1:2|1:1:12|[Wang Bo] continued talking while casually turning his head back towards the carriage. [Wang Li] stood still, glaring at him sideways without saying a word for quite some time, before finally turning around and walking back towards the carriage.
1:1:12|1:1:25|She walked back to her seat in a daze, seeing [Wang Bo] with his hands crossed, leaning against the back of the chair, a wrinkled towel on his head, and his two feet placed on the seat opposite, next to which lay the silly root still asleep on the table.
1:1:25|1:1:40|[Wang Li] didn't say anything, but lifted her leg and kicked [Wang Bo]'s leg. Only then did [Wang Bo] put his leg down, moved to the side, and crossed his legs again. [Wang Li] sat down, placed her purse on her lap, glanced at the soundly sleeping Sha Gen, and then took out her phone from the purse to start typing.
1:1:40|1:1:47|Before long, Wang Bo's phone rang. He took out his phone from his pocket and pulled down the towel covering his face to read the text message.
1:1:53|1:2:5|After Wang Bo finished reading the text message, he looked up at [Wang Li] and saw her staring blankly with dull eyes. He then lowered his head to reply to her with another text message. As soon as [Wang Li] received the message, she immediately opened it to read the content.
1:2:13|1:2:27|[Wang Li] looked at the text message and fell into contemplation. After a while, Wang Bo took [Wang Li]'s bag, pulled out a dry towel from it and handed it to her. He took the other person's phone with his left hand, then raised his right hand, lightly wiped his face, indicating the other person to go wash their face.
1:2:27|1:2:42|[Wang Li] raised her head and blinked, then got up and walked towards the restroom. Wang Bo watched [Wang Li] walking away, then reached into the inside of his seat and took out the cash wrapped in kraft paper. He held it up and proudly shook it in front of the sleeping Sha Gen, then casually put it into [Wang Li]'s bag.
1:2:42|1:2:55|In the luxurious sleeper compartment on the other side, Xiao Ye braided her originally loose hair and changed into a sexy suspender dress. Uncle Li leaned in and kissed her, then held her face and kissed her again.
1:3:20|1:3:27|On the other side, [Wang Li] was retching violently in the bathroom, while Wang Bo placed the suitcase and bag aside and went to help her straighten up.
1:4:11|1:4:16|Wang Bo and [Wang Li] got off the truck together. When [Wang Li] walked to a corridor, she suddenly hesitated.
1:4:30|1:4:46|[Wang Li] was stunned, she quickly lowered her head and rummaged through her bag. [Wang Li] suddenly smirked. Wang Bo grabbed [Wang Li] who was about to leave.
1:4:59|1:5:2|Wang Bo reached out his left hand and patted Wang Li on the shoulder.
1:5:43|1:5:49|Upon hearing Wang Bo's words, Wang Li became somewhat angry. He shook off the other person's hand and spoke angrily.
1:6:5|1:6:11|Wang Bo suddenly slapped [Wang Li], then he reached out to touch [Wang Li]'s cheek.
1:6:27|1:6:40|[Wang Li] said nothing, just stared at Wang Bo. Suddenly, [Wang Li] reached into her pocket and slapped a bank card onto Wang Bo's face.
1:6:51|1:6:58|Wang Bo pressed Wang Li against the wall as she tried to leave. After a moment of eye contact, Wang Li spoke. Wang Bo suddenly felt a bit confused.
1:7:20|1:7:30|After saying that, Teacher Han turned and left. Huang Li's tears kept falling uncontrollably. Wang Bo was also a bit emotional at this moment. He pointed at him with his finger, but his words were trembling.
1:7:52|1:8:4|[Wang Li] wanted to leave, but [Wang Bo] quickly reached out to stop her. She glared at him, then walked out from the other side of his body. This time, [Wang Bo] didn't stop her again, just stood there blankly, not knowing what to do.
1:8:4|1:8:10|[Wang Li] walked towards the direction of the train, and after a few steps, she saw the fool standing not far away, looking around while eating eggs.
1:8:14|1:8:41|She hesitated for a moment, walked to the small food stall next to her and bought a tea egg, then quietly walked to the side of Sha Gen, touched her neck, and asked softly. Sha Gen obediently took out an egg and handed it to [Wang Li]. [Wang Li] took the egg, glanced at it, and with a sudden force, threw the egg away.
1:8:56|1:8:59|Wang Li indeed has an egg in her pocket.
1:9:12|1:9:32|[Wang Li] raised her hand and grabbed a handful of air in front of Sha Gen, then threw it into her bag. Sha Gen obediently opened the bag and rummaged through it. She took out a large pack of facial tissue from the bag and looked at it in confusion.
1:9:44|1:9:59|The train is about to start, Teacher Han walks over and pats Wang Bo. The train is about to start, Teacher Han walks over and pats Wang Bo.
1:10:17|1:10:20|Wang Li walked towards the car while looking back for something.
1:10:23|1:10:38|Wang Bo stood sideways not far away, looking at the figure of [Wang Li], motionless and silent. Soon, the train started again, and the once noisy transfer station instantly became quiet. A broken egg lay quietly in the middle of the track.
1:10:38|1:10:47|Wang Bo finally got on the car. He stood by the window at the connection of the carriages, looking somewhat lonely. Inside the carriage, Wang Li took out the demon-slaying staff given to her by herself and asked.
1:10:52|1:10:54|[Wang Li] was stunned for a moment.
1:11:11|1:11:25|Shagen took the jingling pestle from [Wang Li] and helped her put it around her neck. [Wang Li] smiled, touching the jingling pestle, and asked Shagen a question. Shagen smiled and answered [Wang Li]'s question, his innocent face filled with sincerity.
1:11:26|1:11:41|On the other side, [Wang Bo] was still standing at the connection between the train cars, lost in thought. He had his hands on the walls on both sides, looking somewhat serious. After a while, he suddenly walked into the bar in the left car, where Xiaoye was sitting, drinking and playing around with a foreign man across from her.
1:11:41|1:11:50|[Wang Bo] sat in an empty seat, placed his bag aside. Not far away, the fat man also noticed him. Xiaoye then held up a bottle of beer, sat opposite [Wang Bo], crossed his legs, and greeted him.
1:11:55|1:12:3|He stared at Wang Bo intently, then raised his left hand to hook the right strap of Wang Bo's suspender skirt. Wang Bo was too busy drinking and didn't pay any attention to him.
1:12:20|1:12:22|At this moment, Uncle Li also noticed them.
1:12:35|1:12:40|The fat man not far away walked to the bar and whispered something to Glasses, whose expression looked hesitant.
1:13:6|1:13:16|Xiao Ye looked at [Wang Bo] and nodded again. [Wang Bo] then picked up a piece of ice from the cup on the table, held it in his hand, and said to Xiao Ye.
1:13:24|1:13:41|Hearing the way Wang Bo spoke, Uncle Li turned his head to look at him. He saw Wang Bo forcefully throw the ice cube in his palm upwards. In that instant, Uncle Li suddenly stood up, his face looking a bit off. Wang Bo's eyes were fixed on the falling ice cube, while Xiao Ye had the opposite reaction.
1:13:41|1:14:12|With a smile on his face, [Wang Bo] looked at Wang Li across from him. Just before the ice cube fell, Uncle Li turned his head and walked back. The ice cube fell into the wine, splashing small water droplets. [Wang Bo] reached out to grab it, but Xiao Ye directly pulled the tablecloth over, then snatched the wine glass, leaned back on the sofa, and laughed happily.
1:14:12|1:14:20|Xiaoye raised his glass and drank up the ice in the wine bag. [Wang Bo] looked at her and suddenly smiled. At this moment, Uncle Li also walked to Fatty's side and said unhappily.
1:14:26|1:14:38|Li Shujing stopped and left the bar. The fat man turned around and glanced at Xiao Ye, cursing under his breath. Xiao Ye proudly put his arm around Wang Bo's shoulder and sat beside him, but Wang Bo showed no sign of feeling down.
1:14:51|1:15:3|Xiaoye suddenly collapsed, and on the sofa next to him, Teacher Han was sitting there observing them. [Wang Bo] looked at Xiaoye and slowly lowered his head to speak to him.
1:15:16|1:15:32|Xiao Ye leaned back on the sofa, her body suddenly went limp. The train conductor warned, and Han Laoshi, who was originally in the bar, appeared at the door holding a police badge. It turned out that Han Laoshi was a police officer. He then walked into the train conductor's room, opened his laptop, and began speaking.
1:15:36|1:15:51|Sitting in front of the computer, Pang Chengjing quickly operated the mouse after hearing that, opening the gallery on the computer. Teacher Han then pulled out an electronic pen from the side of his laptop, tapped on the screen a few times, and the dual sketch portrait of Wang [Bo] and [Wang Li] appeared directly on the screen.
1:15:51|1:15:58|Teacher Han immediately printed this image into a photo, got up and handed it to Cheng Jing, who was operating on the computer.
1:16:14|1:16:22|Wang Bo flipped through the photos in the library quickly. Inside the carriage, Sha Gen was sleeping soundly on the table when Wang [Li] suddenly reached out and patted his shoulder.
1:16:28|1:16:44|Shagen obediently took the backpack off his neck and handed it to [Wang Li], then he lay back on the table and fell asleep again. [Wang Li] took the bag, stood up, walked to the opposite side of Shagen, placed the bag inside, then lay down and adjusted her position while taking out her phone from her pocket.
1:16:49|1:16:56|He looked at the sentence, and his mood improved a lot in an instant. A smile suddenly appeared on his face, which was originally full of worries.
1:17:12|1:17:28|Outside the car window, as the sky gradually darkened, [Wang Bo] sat alone in the corner with his hands crossed, placing his bag by his feet, lost in thought. Suddenly, Pangzi and Four Eyes opened the carriage door and walked out. Pangzi kicked [Wang Bo]'s leg, making him irritated, and he scolded in a bad mood.
1:17:33|1:17:35|Wang Bo then squatted down and patted his leg.
1:17:45|1:17:55|Four Eyes looked provocatively at [Wang Bo], who remained silent. After a while, the three of them climbed onto the roof of the train together, speeding along the deserted mountain railway tracks.
1:17:55|1:18:3|[Wang Bo] stood in front, his hair tousled by the wind. He raised his arm and shouted towards the cave hundreds of meters away, calling out to Fatty and Four Eyes.
1:18:20|1:18:36|The fat guy stood with his hands on his hips, letting Siyan and [Wang Bo] compare their courage. When [Wang Bo] heard a noise behind him, he smiled slightly without turning back. Siyan obediently walked to the right side of [Wang Bo], who glanced at him and then held his hand. Siyan felt a bit nervous and unconsciously took a small step back.
1:18:36|1:18:44|Not far behind the three of them, Uncle Li climbed up stealthily, showing his head and quietly observing them. As they approached Li Mountain Cave, [Wang Bo] still had a smile on his face.
1:18:45|1:18:56|Four Eyes' expression became increasingly tense, while the chubby guy behind had already crouched down in advance. Just one second before reaching the cave, Huang Bo remained motionless, but Four Eyes suddenly broke down and shouted loudly.
1:19:0|1:19:16|Four Eyes shouted and crouched down while dodging, but [Wang Bo] persisted until the last second before hitting the cave, then tilted her head back to avoid it. The fast and sharp wind blew her wig off, catching Uncle Li who was secretly observing from behind. Four Eyes crouched on the roof of the car, holding his head in a very embarrassed manner.
1:19:16|1:19:30|Just a second before the train left the cave, the fat man at the back suddenly stood up and kicked [Wang Bo] down. [Wang Bo] lay on the roof, desperately dodging the fat man's attacks. Just as he stood up, he accidentally stepped on the wig that Uncle Li had thrown over, rolling towards the edge of the train.
1:19:30|1:19:38|At the critical moment, [Uncle Li] suddenly rushed over and grabbed [Wang Bo]'s hand. [Wang Bo] almost fell out of the train, in a very dangerous situation.
1:20:26|1:20:31|After speaking, [Uncle Li] pulled [Wang Bo] up with force, and [Wang Bo] lay down on the top of the train.
1:20:34|1:20:45|He widened his eyes, kept patting his chest, and didn't stand up for a long time. After a moment, he climbed into the carriage through the side window of the train with [Uncle Li]. Just as he turned around to leave, he was stopped by [Uncle Li].
1:20:47|1:20:49|[Wang Bo] turned his head to look at [Uncle Li].
1:21:19|1:21:34|[Uncle Li] clasped his hands in a gesture of respect towards [Wang Bo], who returned the gesture with a fist, then turned and opened the carriage door, smiling as he walked inside. [Uncle Li] watched his back without saying another word. Soon after, Four Eyes and Fatty also climbed in, and as soon as Fatty steadied himself, he began to compliment [Uncle Li].
1:21:48|1:21:54|Siyan glanced at Uncle Li, then obediently walked up to him. Pangzi remained silent and turned his body to look outside.
1:22:17|1:22:30|Uncle Li grabbed Siyan's right hand and broke his middle finger, causing Siyan to collapse in pain in Uncle Li's arms. Fatty then turned around to look at the back of Uncle Li's head, his face filled with fear. On the other side, Wang Bo returned to the carriage and woke up Wang Li.
1:22:41|1:22:51|After speaking, [Wang Bo] smiled at [Wang Li], who looked at him with a worried expression. Feeling somewhat guilty, [Wang Li], but suddenly [Wang Bo] smiled.
1:22:56|1:23:13|As soon as the words fell, Wang Po's smile disappeared, and her expression suddenly became somewhat serious. [Wang Li] followed her gaze forward, only to see Uncle Li and Xiao Ye suddenly arrive at the door of the carriage. Xiao Ye crossed her hands and leaned on the door frame, while Uncle Li slowly walked to a position not far from them and sat down with his hands behind his back.
1:23:13|1:23:23|They observed each other, locked eyes for a long time, then suddenly [Wang Bo] turned his head to glance at [Wang Li]. [Wang Li] paused, looked at Uncle Li, then lowered her head and spoke.
1:23:41|1:23:52|[Wang Bo] has always had a carefree expression, but at this moment he appears particularly serious. [Wang Li] doesn't speak anymore, but watches Uncle Li not far away with [Wang Bo]. Uncle Li still maintains a smiling expression as he looks at them.
1:23:52|1:24:6|After a while, Wang Li turned around and glanced at Xiao Ye leaning against the door frame. Xiao Ye seemed to have received some message, took a few steps forward, and sat in the empty seat behind Uncle Wang Li. Both sides became somewhat tense at this moment. Just then, the train's announcement suddenly sounded.
1:24:18|1:24:36|Teacher Han heard the noise and walked out of the carriage directly. Silly Root, who was originally sleeping, also woke up. Silly Root was easily influenced, as soon as he stood up, he wanted to leave, but [Wang Bo] quickly reached out to stop him.
1:25:2|1:25:11|[Wang Bo] stood up and sat next to Sha Gen to shield him, then exchanged a glance with [Wang Li], turned his head to look at Uncle Li who was staring at him, and Sha Gen patted [Wang Bo] on the shoulder and persuaded him.
1:25:23|1:25:31|[Wang Li] hung Shagen's bag back around her neck. Shagen obediently lowered his head to take the backpack, then placed it on the side, smiling as he turned to go donate blood.
1:25:31|1:25:45|[Wang Li] looked full of worry in her eyes. She turned her head to look at [Wang Bo] who was ready to follow. [Wang Bo] comfortingly patted her shoulder, then walked forward with a smile. Her gaze drifted between Sha Gen's bag and Uncle Li, seeing Uncle Li also looking at her with a mysterious smile.
1:25:45|1:25:55|His expression became more alert, [Wang Li] remained in her seat, still not very reassured. He leaned forward slightly, tilting his head to stare at the changing scenes in front of him, the images shifting back and forth on the faces of the three people.
1:25:55|1:26:5|Just as [Wang Bo] passed by Uncle Li and continued to walk forward, Uncle Li remained motionless, eerily quiet. [Wang Bo] forced a smile and continued to follow Sha Gen forward.
1:26:5|1:26:15|Not long after walking a few steps, Wang Bo saw an old man wearing a duckbill cap standing on the seat, looking up and rummaging through the luggage rack. In front of the old man was a young mother holding a baby.
1:26:15|1:26:27|[Wang Bo] had a bad feeling, the smile on his face completely disappeared, while Uncle Li's smile suddenly became obvious. Sure enough, in the next second, the old man searching for luggage suddenly knocked over a huge metal thermos from the luggage rack.
1:26:28|1:26:35|[Wang Bo] rushed up immediately, just before the cup was about to hit the baby, he reached out and caught the cup, returning it to the old man.
1:26:35|1:26:44|[Wang Bo] then turned his head to look for Shagen's figure, only to see him walking to the door of the carriage, brushing past a conductor pushing a temporary cart. At that moment, the train happened to pass through a tunnel.
1:26:45|1:26:52|The carriage suddenly became dark, [Wang Bo] muttered that it was not good, hurriedly took a few steps to chase Sha Gen, and was then blocked by Xiao Ye the next second.
1:26:52|1:27:2|They fought in the darkness, with [Wang Bo] landing a punch on Xiao Ye's stomach, lifting him up and throwing him backwards from above. Xiao Ye suddenly flew up and then fell heavily to the ground.
1:27:2|1:27:17|[Wang Bo] quickly ran a few steps to get behind Sha Gen, and opened his bag. The money wrapped in kraft paper inside had disappeared without a trace. [Wang Bo] reached into the bag and took out a folded piece of paper. After unfolding it, three words were written on it: "You lost!" with an exclamation mark.
1:27:33|1:27:47|Shagen waved to Wang Bo, walked towards the editing room without looking back. Wang Bo walked back to the carriage with extremely slow steps. As he walked forward, he glanced at Uncle Li with the corner of his eye. Uncle Li still maintained a smiling expression leaning back in his chair watching him.
1:27:47|1:27:55|[Wang Bo] walked up to [Wang Li] and handed him the note in his hand. [Wang Li] took the note and looked at it, then looked up at Uncle Li and spoke.
1:28:1|1:28:14|[Wang Bo] didn't say a word. Instead, he put a cigarette in his mouth, leaned back on the chair for a while, then bent down to light the cigarette. In his mind, he recalled the baby who was almost hit by the kettle just now, and the old man who knocked the kettle off the luggage rack.
1:28:14|1:28:24|[Wang Bo] looked up and saw Uncle Li not far away. Siyan walked to Uncle Li's side, lifted his clothes, and took out the stolen money from under his left arm with his right hand wrapped in a bandage, handing it directly to Uncle Li.
1:28:25|1:28:37|Uncle Li took the money with a smile, held it in front of him for a while, then looked at [Wang Bo] with a victorious smile. Just as he was feeling pleased with himself, he heard Sizhi suddenly whispering in his ear.
1:28:42|1:29:0|Uncle Li's smile disappeared instantly. He glanced at Wang Bo with the corner of his eye, then stared at him, lost in thought. After a few minutes, he stood up from his seat, holding the money in his left hand, and walked step by step to sit opposite Wang Bo. He placed the money on the table, sighed with pursed lips.
1:29:0|1:29:7|[Wang Bo] held [Wang Li]'s arm with one hand, both looking at the menacing Mr. Li approaching. Mr. Li spoke slowly.
1:29:24|1:29:36|[Wang Bo] looked at the leather finger wind on the table with a somewhat inexplicable expression. Without saying a word, Uncle Li suddenly sat up and patted [Wang Bo]'s hand.
1:29:39|1:29:54|Uncle Li finished speaking and then stood up, walking out of the carriage with his hands behind his back. [Wang Li] lowered her head and opened the cowhide paper package in front of her, only to find two full towers of Ming coins inside.
1:30:24|1:30:43|On the other side, as soon as Uncle Li stepped out of the carriage, he was immediately held at gunpoint to his head and pushed back. Three masked individuals rushed in.
1:30:47|1:31:6|After Uncle Li finished complaining, he was punched by a robber. Now in the blood room, a thick needle was inserted into Wang Bo's vein. He trembled in pain, slowly turning his head. The masked nurse comforted him while drawing blood, and Wang Bo kept his eyes closed, still too afraid to look down.
1:31:6|1:31:12|In the carriage, Uncle Li had a gun pointed at his head, while another tall and thin bandit held a gun at the other passengers.
1:31:16|1:31:27|The chubby robber turned his head and saw Wang Li, he suddenly froze. He walked towards Wang Li with an axe in his hand.
1:32:6|1:32:8|[Wang Bo] suddenly raised the fake money on the table.
1:32:29|1:32:38|The chubby robber swung the axe at the chair next to [Wang Bo]'s head, snatching the bullion paper from his hand, and the paper money inside scattered all over the floor. The chubby robber picked up a stack and said,
1:32:40|1:32:43|Wang Bo suddenly turned around and cursed.
1:33:10|1:33:37|The chubby robber, with a lewd smile, bent down and touched the woman's waist. His smile froze on his face the next second. The chubby robber didn't speak for a long time, but the skinny robber became anxious.
1:33:41|1:34:13|The chubby robber slowly got up, looking terrified. Uncle Li took the opportunity to snatch the gun from the robber next to him, holding the robber who had Uncle Li hostage, while the female police officer then pointed her gun at another person. The middle-aged man who was being aimed at looked dumbfounded. The old man who had previously cooperated with [Uncle Li] was also brought out. The female police officer then nudged the glasses-wearing man with her gun.
1:34:18|1:34:28|The man next to the actor was also arrested. In the luxurious sleeper compartment, Xiao Ye stood in front of the mirror, dressed in a police uniform. [Uncle Li] peeked out and looked at him, then sat back in his chair, gesturing with both hands.
1:34:36|1:34:38|Xiaoye sat in the arms of [Uncle Li] and asked.
1:34:57|1:35:7|Xiao Ye pondered for a moment, then stood up from [Li Shu]'s arms, slowly turned around and sat on the sofa behind him, holding a pair of handcuffs in his hands, pursed his lips and looked up at [Li Shu].
1:35:9|1:35:19|[Wang Bo] looked up at Xiao Ye without saying a word, but his eyes seemed to convey trust. Seeing his expression, Xiao Ye could only lower his head and lean on [Wang Bo]'s hand.
1:35:24|1:35:28|After speaking, [Uncle Li] raised his hand and rubbed his eyes.
1:36:42|1:36:53|Shagen was placed in a luxurious sleeper compartment sleeping soundly with no one around. [Wang Bo] sat at the door with his head propped up, lost in thought. [Wang Li] held Shagen's bag and sat quietly in front of the bed, watching him.
1:37:21|1:37:40|The tattered cloth bag in Wang Li's hand was squeezed tighter and deformed by the sleeping Wang Bo. Wang Bo was still sleeping soundly, showing no signs of waking up. Wang Li looked at the sleeping Wang Bo with a worried and sad expression. Wang Bo walked to the door, pressed his ear against it, and listened to the sounds outside.
1:37:40|1:37:51|Then he walked over to [Wang Li], squeezed her shoulder, and sat down to her right. [Wang Li] kept staring blankly at Sha Gen, and [Wang Bo] then bent down, gently embracing [Wang Li]'s shoulder, warming and comforting her.
1:37:56|1:38:9|[Wang Bo] looked at [Wang Li] seriously, while [Wang Li] glanced at him and remained silent. [Wang Bo] then took the bag from [Wang Li]'s arms, placed it on the inner side of the bed, adjusted the straps, gently touched Sha Gen's cheek, and softly patted her.
1:38:9|1:38:17|At that moment, the sleeper door suddenly opened, and Teacher Han walked in.
1:38:31|1:38:46|Teacher Han took out the money wrapped in parchment from his arms and put it back into Sha Gen's bag. [Wang Bo] supported [Wang Li] and sat on the bench opposite the bed. After putting away the money, Teacher Han sat on the bed and straightened his clothes, then spoke to them.
1:38:52|1:38:58|Upon hearing Teacher Han's question, [Wang Bo] remained silent and instead lowered his head to look at his fingers.
1:40:49|1:40:53|Teacher Han then pulled out a photo of [Wang Bo] and [Wang Li].
1:41:15|1:41:28|Teacher Han walked out of the luxurious sleeper car alone, took off his coat, sat on the chair by the door, and casually placed a pair of handcuffs aside. Two city police officers approached, with one of them sitting beside him and speaking.
1:41:42|1:41:44|In the sleeper compartment, Xiao Ye is feeding water to [Li Shu].
1:42:10|1:42:14|Listening to Uncle Li's words, Xiao Ye suddenly burst into tears and squatted beside Uncle Li.
1:42:30|1:42:56|Xiaoye took off the police cap from his head and put it on Uncle Li's face, then opened the door and ran out to surrender. Teacher Han heard the noise and pressed him at the doorway. Uncle Li lay on the sofa, took off the police cap from his face. Teacher Han sat across from Uncle Li, holding a gun. Uncle Li nodded and said self-deprecatingly.
1:42:58|1:43:1|Teacher Han goes outside and checks his phone.
1:43:28|1:43:32|In another luxurious sleeper compartment, [Wang Bo] and [Wang Li] are cuddling together.
1:43:37|1:43:41|Take advantage of the fact that the child has not yet acknowledged the situation.
1:44:3|1:44:8|Listening to the harsh words of [Wang Bo], [Wang Li] showed no fear at all, but instead smiled and reached out to touch his face.
1:44:19|1:44:35|The sunlight outside the car window shines through the curtains onto them. [Wang Li] lies in [Wang Bo]'s arms, one hand on her belly and the other tightly holding [Wang Bo]'s right hand. [Wang Bo] hugs her tightly as they gaze deeply into each other's eyes, as if wanting to engrave each other's features in their minds.
1:44:35|1:44:43|After a while, [Wang Bo] gently caressed his body, lightly kissed [Wang Li]'s forehead, paused for a moment, and then kissed the other's eyes.
1:44:44|1:44:50|[Wang Li] closed her eyes and quietly savored the kiss from her lover, both of them enjoying the rare moment of tranquility.
1:44:50|1:45:5|Just as the two of them were quietly leaning against each other, Uncle Li in the next luxurious sleeper car took advantage of the lack of supervision, lifted his hand and took off a button from his clothes. Surprisingly, there was a needle at the end of the button facing downwards. He used this needle to secretly unlock the handcuffs, and then opened the ventilation opening above his head.
1:45:5|1:45:19|First he threw the coat up, then climbed up himself. He then took a long cylindrical bag from nearby, unzipped the bag, took out a pair of rubber shoes from the compartment, and then pulled out a small bundle of rope with iron hooks from the shoes.
1:45:19|1:45:35|Just as he was about to change clothes, he suddenly heard some movement behind him. He quietly crouched down and saw [Wang Bo] helping [Wang Li] climb out from a ventilation duct not far in front. The two of them quietly crawled forward along the wooden planks, and after observing them for a while, [Uncle Li] also followed suit and crawled forward.
1:45:35|1:45:48|After climbing for a while, [Uncle Li] suddenly stopped next to the ventilation opening where [Wang Bo] and [Wang Li] climbed out. He leaned over the opening and saw Sha Gen sound asleep below, so he quietly took out the rope with a hook, slowly lowering it down.
1:45:49|1:46:0|The rope smoothly hooked onto the bag beside Wang Bo. [Uncle Li] slowly pulled the rope upwards without making any sound, while Wang Bo on the bed didn't notice any movement at all.
1:46:0|1:46:9|Wang Bo and Wang Li, who had been crawling forward for a long time, finally arrived under the skylight. Wang Bo pushed open the iron window above his head with force, looked around, while Wang Li squatted quietly on the side, waiting.
1:46:10|1:46:21|Beside the air vent, [Uncle Li] has successfully obtained Shagen's bag. He puts the bag in his left hand, bends down, and reaches out to close the small wooden door of the air vent. Everything goes so smoothly.
1:46:21|1:46:32|He observed [Wang Li] and [Wang Bo] in front of him, feeling pleased with himself. He intended to tidy up the rope he had just used, but accidentally pulled too hard, causing the end with the hook to suddenly hit the iron pillar.
1:46:33|1:46:50|The crisp voice instantly reached the ears of [Wang Li] ahead, she was stunned for a moment, and the supposed to be caught [Uncle Li] unexpectedly appeared behind with Sha Gen's bag. Seeing this, [Wang Li] became anxious in an instant, she pulled [Wang Bo] down and said urgently.
1:47:6|1:47:21|[Wang Bo] used all his strength to tightly hold onto [Wang Li], not letting her pass. [Wang Li] viciously bit onto [Wang Bo]'s arm, then slowly released it. She turned her head to look at [Wang Bo], then turned back to see Uncle Li crawling towards them. In the end, she decided to listen to [Wang Bo] and trust him once more.
1:47:22|1:47:34|[Wang Li] slowly got up and climbed out of the skylight with the help of [Wang Bo]. She then took off the silly root and put her fragrant pestle around [Wang Bo]'s neck.
1:47:37|1:47:46|[Wang Li] knelt on top of the train, holding [Wang Bo]'s face in her hands, pleading. She looked deeply into [Wang Bo]'s eyes, then kissed him deeply on the neck.
1:47:46|1:47:57|[Wang Bo] raised his hand to embrace her, responding affectionately. They both closed their eyes simultaneously, feeling each other's breath with their hearts. An indescribable atmosphere of sadness spread between them.
1:47:57|1:48:13|After a while, [Wang Li] climbed to the top of the ladder on the side of the train, then jumped down with force. She stood up, looked back, and ran in the opposite direction. Meanwhile, [Wang Bo], who had bid farewell to his lover, climbed down from the top of the train. She knelt on one knee, quietly waiting for Uncle Li to approach.
1:48:15|1:48:26|Uncle Li crawled over step by step not far away, his pace showing no signs of hesitation, as if carrying a fierce determination to win. [Wang Bo] maintained the same posture, staring motionlessly at Uncle Li.
1:48:26|1:48:38|And at this moment, Uncle Li had already crawled up to [Wang Bo]. He knelt on the ground to catch his breath for a moment, then slowly lifted his head, looking at the blue deer tiger in front of him. After a brief pause, he began to speak while catching his breath.
1:48:43|1:48:46|Uncle Li gasped for breath and casually raised the bag in his hand.
1:48:57|1:49:7|The two rushed forward at the same time, clasping hands as they confronted each other on the speeding train. [Wang Bo] stared at Uncle Li, sweat dripping down his cheeks.
1:49:7|1:49:17|With the sound of roaring, the train arrived at the station. The police escorted Wang Bo, Wang Li, and other henchmen of Uncle Li, as well as a few robbers who suddenly appeared along the way, onto the police car.
1:49:20|1:49:33|On the other side of the train, an old man with a large suitcase on his back, a backpack and a water bottle on his shoulders, was walking out with the crowd. He carried his load, wearing a hat and sunglasses, holding a cane in one hand, taking small steps forward, slowly feeling his way ahead.
1:49:33|1:49:42|However, as he walked on, he was stopped by a fully armed police officer raising his hand. The person disguised as a blind old man was none other than [Uncle Li] in disguise.
1:49:43|1:49:51|In the face of the police around him, Uncle Li remained calm. He pretended to be blind, raising his hand to touch the neck and cheek of the police officer.
1:50:1|1:50:13|He raised his arm and patted the policeman's shoulder, then continued to walk with a hunchback, turning to another direction. However, after a few steps, Uncle Li suddenly stopped, looking at more and more police in front of him, and then turned his body around abruptly.
1:50:13|1:50:18|However, just as he took two steps, Wang Bo was stopped in his tracks. He trembled as he raised his hand and touched the handcuffs in front of him.
1:50:30|1:50:47|Uncle Li finally put on the handcuffs tremblingly. Uncle Li was eventually arrested, and the story on the train came to an end. Five months later, Teacher Han walked into a restaurant alone. He folded up an umbrella, shook off the water on it, and then placed it at the door.
1:50:47|1:50:50|Sitting across from them was [Wang Li], who was devouring the burrito voraciously.
1:50:51|1:51:6|[Wang Li] held a pancake in both hands, looked up at Teacher Han without speaking, hesitated for a moment, then stuffed the pancake into her mouth. She then lowered her head again, holding the pancake in one hand and using the other hand to pick up some roast duck, shredded scallions, and shredded cucumber to put on the pancake before rolling it up.
1:51:8|1:51:24|[Wang Li] still ignored Teacher Han, just kept lowering her head and stuffing things into her mouth one after another. At this moment, [Wang Li] was obviously already a soon-to-be mother. She was wearing a loose dress, her belly bulging, and her long hair loosely tied behind her head. After finishing one pancake, she continued to wrap another one.
1:51:24|1:51:32|Teacher Han stood by the dining table, watching her for a long time. Then he pulled out a chair, placed his bag on the left side of the table, and sat opposite her.
1:51:45|1:52:1|The scene suddenly flashed back to that day, the train was still speeding along the tracks. A hand covered in blood, holding Shagen's bag, reached down from the ventilation opening on the top of the train. The hand trembled as it dropped the bag next to Shagen's head, a drop of blood falling on his cheek.
1:52:1|1:52:6|Shagen's eyes were tightly closed, his eyelashes trembling slightly, as if sensing something, but still not waking up.
1:52:7|1:52:22|After a moment, the hand slowly retracted, and before leaving the vent, it closed the small wooden door that had been opened. The camera moved up through the vent, and a small puddle of blood dripped onto the wooden board. The hand that had just been there lay limp on the side.
1:52:23|1:52:39|The owner of the hand is [Wang Bo], who stayed behind to fight with Uncle Li. He squints his eyes, with a blood mark on his cheek and a small magic pestle given by [Wang Li] hanging around his neck. His left hand is placed on his chest, loosely holding a mobile phone with its outer screen lit up, displaying an unsent message.
1:52:40|1:52:53|His palms and arms were covered with scars from the knife cuts made by Uncle Li. They fought to the death in such a confined space. And at the last moment, [Wang Bo] successfully snatched back the package from Uncle Li's hands.
1:52:53|1:53:10|At that moment, Uncle Li forcefully threw the rope with an iron hook in his hand backwards, halfway through he pulled it back sharply. [Wang Bo] couldn't dodge in time, the iron hook pierced into his neck. He lay on the ground, clenched his right fist and pounded the wooden board beneath him, while Uncle Li behind him tightly strangled his neck with the rope.
1:53:10|1:53:21|[Wang Bo]'s tapping on the wooden board successfully reached Teacher Han's ears. He stood outside the luxurious sleeper compartment, looked up, sensed something was wrong, and quickly turned around to go into the compartment to check the situation.
1:53:21|1:53:29|The sleeper compartment door lock had been deliberately damaged. Despite his best efforts, he could only push open a small gap, not even able to stick his head in.
1:53:30|1:53:40|After observing for a moment outside the door, he turned and walked out of the carriage, climbing onto the roof of the train using the ladder on the side. After a brief inspection, Teacher Han and a police officer opened the skylight on the roof of the train.
1:53:42|1:53:53|The dazzling sunlight shone through the skylight, reflecting on the lifeless face of [Wang Bo]. Teacher Han was lying on the roof of the car, looking directly at [Wang Bo], then reached out and picked up his phone from his chest.
1:53:57|1:54:10|Teacher Han didn't turn off his phone, but sent out the message. He helped [Wang Bo] to complete the last thing the other person wanted to do before their life disappeared. The scene returned to the restaurant, where Teacher Han told everything to [Wang Li].
1:54:31|1:54:49|After Mr. Han finished speaking, he left the restaurant with his bag. [Wang Li] leaned back in her chair, showing no reaction to Mr. Han's words. Her expression was somewhat blank, staying motionless for a while before snapping out of it. She then straightened up, propped herself on the armrest of the chair, and continued to pick up food with her chopsticks to eat.
1:54:49|1:54:56|Wang Li's increasingly red eyes clearly revealed her emotions. She held back her sadness and took another pancake wrapped with roast duck to eat.
1:54:57|1:55:10|He mechanically stuffed food into his mouth, chewing mechanically, with sauce smeared at the corners of his mouth and no time to wipe it off. He rolled one pancake after another into his mouth, the movements becoming more and more sloppy, not even wrapping the cucumber properly before stuffing it into his mouth.
1:55:10|1:55:21|Finally, at this moment, tears couldn't be held back anymore. He couldn't help but cry, but his eating motion never stopped. He cried while eating, yet still managed to hold back from making any sound.
1:55:26|1:55:42|At this moment, [Wang Li] seemed like a child who had been wronged, as if only food could give her a sense of security. The truth was right in front of her, and she could no longer deceive herself. At this moment, she clearly understood that [Wang Bo] was already dead, and there was no way he could come back.
1:55:42|1:55:46|She lost the love of her life, the child in her belly, and no longer has a father.
1:56:15|1:56:24|Time flies, and it's winter again. [Wang Li], dressed in winter clothes and wearing the same pair of lace gloves, came to Tibet alone once again.
1:56:24|1:56:34|She knelt in the snow with her eyes closed, hands clasped in front of her in a prayerful manner, facing the passing pedestrians without being affected at all, wholeheartedly praying for something.
1:56:35|1:56:50|On the other side, on the snow-covered grassland, several herdsmen in Tibetan costumes found a baby. The herdsmen picked up the baby from the snow, anxiously picked up the cloth on the ground, and covered the baby's exposed legs. The baby lay in the arms of the herdsmen, crying loudly, looking very pitiful.
