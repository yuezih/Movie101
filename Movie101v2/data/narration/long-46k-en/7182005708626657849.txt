0:0:57|0:1:14|Accompanied by Sheng Nan's singing, the scene begins to show his journey to Beijing to pursue his dreams alone after bidding farewell to his girlfriend. Despite facing setbacks, he never gives up. Whether it's morning or night, you can see him singing freely with his guitar on the overpass.
0:1:14|0:1:20|Occasionally lost and confused, he would think back to the wonderful love of his student days, remembering the girl named [Bai Jing].
0:1:26|0:1:37|In the underground passage, a man walked past [Sheng Nan] and [Yang Yang], dropping a coin. Yang Yang picked it up and expressed gratitude, while Sheng Nan leaned in to take a closer look.
0:2:16|0:2:19|[Sheng Nan] gave all her change to [Yang Yang], but [Yang Yang] just casually threw it on the ground.
0:2:46|0:2:59|[Sheng Nan] turned around and put the guitar into the box. After organizing the money on the ground, [Yang Yang] carefully looked at [Sheng Nan]. After fastening the buckle on the guitar case, [Sheng Nan] turned around, only to find [Yang Yang] staring at him motionless.
0:3:5|0:3:14|[Sheng Nan] got up and left, [Yang Yang] picked up the money and immediately followed. When [Sheng Nan] heard [Yang Yang] following, she stopped and turned around to face him.
0:3:15|0:3:34|After speaking, [Sheng Nan] accelerated and walked forward, leaving [Yang Yang] standing still, looking ahead with a reluctant expression. He slowly returned to his original position and sat down, pondering over the money in his arms. After a moment, he took out the pendant hanging around his neck, which contained a photo of him and his parents.
0:3:34|0:3:44|In the photo, the mother is holding him, while the father stands beside him, the whole family smiling happily. As [Yang Yang] looked at it, he choked up, recalling that experience.
0:3:51|0:4:8|After realizing she had been abandoned, [Yang Yang] cried bitterly. The scene then cut back to the underground passage. With [Yang Yang] sobbing, the title "Dads Are the Best" gradually appeared on the screen.
0:4:11|0:4:13|At the entrance of the bar, the boss taunted [Sheng Nan].
0:4:23|0:4:32|[Sheng Nan] looked at the boss, reluctant to leave. The boss walked back to the bar disdainfully, and the camera shifted to [Sheng Nan] going to another company for an interview.
0:4:42|0:4:51|After the female employee left, [Sheng Nan] sat down slowly, nervously looking at the original record in her hand, then gazing into the distance.
0:5:16|0:5:28|The director turned his head and pondered for a moment, then pointed at the female employee. The female employee stuck out her tongue and whispered.
0:5:38|0:5:40|Sheng Nan pushed the record away.
0:5:50|0:5:57|Lian Songke went to sell roast duck, [Sheng Nan] awkwardly smiled.
0:6:14|0:6:26|The female employee saw a photo of [Sheng Nan] and [Yang Yang] together online. After watching [Sheng Nan] leave, the CEO turned around and threw a record with an original song to the female employee.
0:6:30|0:6:40|The female employee picked up the record, checked that the director had left, and then secretly hid the record in her bag. The scene shifted, and [Sheng Nan] appeared to participate in the music program.
0:7:37|0:7:43|Sheng Nan looked a bit confused, but still nodded and then turned around to leave. Another contestant pushed the door open and entered.
0:7:58|0:8:6|The scene shifts to an underground passage, where passersby are chatting and laughing. [Yang Yang] is leaning against the wall, asleep with a few coins in hand.
0:8:6|0:8:18|Sheng Nan, who was walking by, slowly stopped in his tracks when he saw Yang Yang. After a moment of contemplation, he shook his head, then bent down to place the guitar and food he was carrying on the ground before walking over to Yang Yang.
0:8:18|0:8:26|Looking at the already asleep Yang Yang, he took off his own coat, adjusted the angle, and squatted down to gently drape it over Yang Yang.
0:8:28|0:8:38|The scene was captured by the woman across with a camera. After putting it on, [Sheng Nan] continued to squat beside [Yang Yang], adjusting the position of the clothes. [Yang Yang] slowly woke up.
0:9:0|0:9:19|[Sheng Nan] sat down and handed the food to [Yang Yang]. [Yang Yang] happily took the food but didn't know how to open it. Seeing this, [Sheng Nan] quickly leaned forward to help her open it. The woman across from them continued to film their actions, adjusting the camera settings before pressing the shutter.
0:9:19|0:9:24|Finally opening the bag, [Yang Yang] started eating voraciously.
0:9:42|0:9:47|[Yang Yang] placed the food on her lap, took out a pendant, and handed the photo of her parents to [Sheng Nan].
0:10:20|0:10:38|Both of them had happy smiles on their faces. [Sheng Nan] turned around and picked up the guitar case next to him, opened it, and inside was a brand new guitar. He carefully took out the guitar and placed it on his body, then put on the strap, adjusted his posture, and started to sing and play.
0:10:38|0:10:47|He turned around and looked at [Yang Yang], who was eating something while looking satisfied at [Sheng Nan]. The woman opposite quickly pressed the shutter button to take a photo.
0:10:54|0:11:24|The fateful starry sky blooms with smiles, holding onto the excitement in the heart, with eyes only for you. Whether shedding tears or feeling empty, it's all a form of relaxation. In [Sheng Nan]'s girlfriend [Bai Jing]'s circle, her best friend is introducing an older man next to her, instilling in him a different set of beliefs.
0:11:24|0:11:26|Bai Jing thoughtfully pondered for a moment.
0:12:21|0:12:26|The scene shifts to Sheng Nan's home, where Sheng Nan's mother is crying while looking at a photo of Sheng Nan.
0:13:15|0:13:21|[Yang Yang]'s mom glared angrily at [Yang Yang]'s dad, then said helplessly. [Yang Yang]'s dad poured out the bottle of wine.
0:13:39|0:13:45|In the underground passage, [Sheng Nan] is preparing to take [Yang Yang] to the orphanage.
0:14:22|0:14:40|Ready to leave, [Sheng Nan] hesitated upon hearing this, but ultimately stopped and left. The beggar beside her cursed. He threw the water bottle in his hand aside and looked at [Sheng Nan] indignantly. On the street, [Sheng Nan] began to recall the scene where [Yang Yang] treated him like a father, and he also began to hesitate.
0:15:3|0:15:5|In the underground passage, [Yang Yang] mutters to himself.
0:15:51|0:16:3|[Sheng Nan] brought [Yang Yang] to his residence, surrounded by rows of small bungalows. He took out the key and opened a door. As night fell, [Yang Yang] sat on the bed while [Sheng Nan] was washing clothes for her.
0:16:12|0:16:19|[Yang Yang] lay on the bed with a yogurt in hand, excitedly tossing and turning, then noticed a quiet photo on the bedside.
0:16:24|0:16:27|Sheng Nan smiled and hung up her clothes.
0:16:49|0:16:59|The scene shifts, [Bai Jing] is sitting in a restaurant with a foreign man. The man is staring blankly at [Bai Jing], while she awkwardly smiles.
0:17:8|0:17:16|The man took out a bottle of eye drops from his bag and put some in his eyes. [Bai Jing] looked at him in surprise.
0:17:32|0:17:34|[Bai Jing] saw that he had guessed everything correctly, and she couldn't help but smile.
0:17:57|0:18:1|The bustling street was filled with traffic, while [Sheng Nan] continued to sing in the underground passage.
0:19:50|0:20:9|Sheng Nan seemed lost in thought. Suddenly, the man took out a ring from his bag and showed various pieces of evidence: cards, one million, a villa, and got into the car.
0:20:13|0:20:27|The man pointed outside the window, where a convertible sports car was parked not far away. [Bai Jing] followed the man's gaze and saw the sports car. Upon seeing it, she lowered her head in thought, while the man continued to stare at her without moving.
0:21:24|0:21:41|After looking at the sports car outside the window and the bank card and keys on the table, he lowered his head in contemplation. After thinking for a long time, [Bai Jing] finally looked up at the opposite side, but there was no one there. Only when [Bai Jing] turned his head did he realize that the man had already ridden his bike outside the window, ready to leave.
0:21:50|0:22:5|The man gave a thumbs-up to [Bai Jing], pointed to the sports car, and then rode away. On the other side, [Sheng Nan] and [Yang Yang] were walking on the street, playing and having fun together.
0:22:5|0:22:14|A sports car slowly drove into the luxury villa area, the driver clumsily stepped on the brake but didn't stop smoothly, moving forward a short distance before coming to a halt.
0:22:15|0:22:37|[Bai Jing] got out of the driver's seat. She was dressed up exquisitely today, a departure from her usual simple style. Looking at the buildings in front of her, she seemed lost in thought. When she reached a door, she stopped and looked around. She took out her phone from her bag and answered a call.
0:22:53|0:23:9|After hanging up, Bai Jing received another call quickly. Upon hearing the voice, Bai Jing hesitated for a moment before speaking.
0:23:20|0:23:30|[Sheng Nan] hesitated for a moment, hesitantly touched Yang Yang's head. Then, she turned and walked to the edge of the bridge. After making sure Yang Yang couldn't hear, she whispered.
0:23:51|0:23:55|After hanging up the phone, he looked into the distance in confusion, and [Yang Yang] came up behind him.
0:24:37|0:24:42|He placed Yang Yang's hand properly and covered him with a blanket. Yang Yang yawned sleepily.
0:24:47|0:25:4|[Sheng Nan] stood by the bed for a long time before turning away. While it seemed like [Yang Yang] was already fast asleep, she was actually pretending. Upon hearing [Sheng Nan] leave, [Yang Yang] opened her eyes, got up, put on her clothes and shoes, walked to the washbasin, and started washing the clothes that [Sheng Nan] hadn't had a chance to clean.
0:25:4|0:25:11|He clumsily sat on the small stool, rolled up his sleeves and sprinkled some laundry detergent into the basin, then started washing.
0:26:11|0:26:23|Upon returning home, Sheng Nan found Yang Yang already fast asleep, while the dirty laundry in the basin had been washed. Bai Jing smiled contentedly, looking at the new dress he had bought for Yang Yang in his hand, and then at the clothes she had just washed for him.
0:26:32|0:26:47|In the underground passage, [Sheng Nan] continues to sing, while [Yang Yang] dances happily in her new dress beside her. The woman with short hair continues to film everything and posts it online. A female employee from the record company happens to see this video and calls the music teacher.
0:26:55|0:26:58|Suddenly someone shouted that the urban management officers were coming, and [Sheng Nan] quickly left with [Yang Yang].
0:28:4|0:28:25|[Sheng Nan] smiled and [Yang Yang] fed him the candied hawthorn in her hand. He took a satisfied bite, then the camera shifted to [Bai Jing], who was on a date with her foreign boyfriend at a café. The man teased her and touched [Bai Jing]'s hand, making her shyly smile.
0:28:25|0:28:27|[Bai Jing] glanced at her boyfriend and whispered to the side.
0:28:41|0:28:49|After hanging up the phone, [Bai Jing] smiled but looked somewhat unnaturally at her boyfriend. The camera then shifted to the cafeteria.
0:29:7|0:29:11|[Bai Jing] smiled and nodded, while [Sheng Nan] remained silent with her head down.
0:29:29|0:29:33|The couple at the next table were chatting animatedly, while they sat there awkwardly.
0:29:46|0:30:1|[Sheng Nan] avoided everything in front of her by eating. She chewed slowly and thoughtfully, while [Bai Jing] looked at her somewhat puzzled. After pondering for a moment, Bai Jing picked up her bag from the table and took out some money to put on the table.
0:30:1|0:30:8|[Sheng Nan] ignored it and kept eating with her head down, while [Bai Jing] slowly pushed the money over.
0:30:17|0:30:35|[Sheng Nan] stared blankly at the food in front of her without saying a word, while [Bai Jing] finished speaking and then got up to leave, leaving [Sheng Nan] sitting there alone. After [Bai Jing] walked away, [Sheng Nan] began to continue eating with her head down, using this method to dispel her embarrassment and vent her grievances and unwillingness.
0:30:35|0:30:44|After dinner, [Sheng Nan] once again boarded the train back to Beijing alone. Sitting across from a couple who were intimate with each other, she looked out the window at the scenery, feeling lonely.
0:30:53|0:31:8|The scene cuts to an office, where Sheng Nan throws a file onto Yang Yang's head. She looks at him defiantly, and he angrily points a small knife at her before calming down.
0:31:53|0:31:56|[Sheng Nan] angrily left, leaving the man standing there awkwardly.
0:32:5|0:32:16|Sheng Nan came to the underground passage in a daze. As she walked down, she stumbled and kicked the step in anger before composing herself and continuing forward.
0:32:35|0:32:52|[Sheng Nan] sat in the underground passage, singing attentively. [Yang Yang] slowly walked towards her. After walking for a while, she came to [Sheng Nan]'s side in a daze and sat down against the wall. Seeing a woman suddenly sitting next to her, [Sheng Nan] stopped and looked at her.
0:32:52|0:32:54|[Sheng Nan] said dazedly.
0:32:59|0:33:10|[Chuchu] looked somewhat disdainful, turned around and rummaged through her bag, while [Sheng Nan] played with a chess set. Then, [Chuchu] took out a hundred yuan bill from her bag and placed it in front of [Sheng Nan], saying arrogantly.
0:33:13|0:33:23|[Sheng Nan] glanced at it, returned the money. [Yang Yang] rolled her eyes, took out a few more from her bag, and threw them on [Sheng Nan].
0:33:28|0:33:55|[Sheng Nan] first smiled, then sighed, and proceeded to neatly arrange the money before putting it back on [Yang Yang]. [Yang Yang] leaned against the wall with her eyes closed, looking completely indifferent. In the next scene, [Sheng Nan] had already sent [Yang Yang] back home.
0:33:55|0:33:57|[Chuchu] is lying on the sofa, calling out someone else's name.
0:33:58|0:34:9|He carefully unfolded the blanket, moved [Chuchu]'s feet off the sofa, and covered her with the blanket. Then, with his back to the sofa, he picked up a pen and wrote a few words for [Chuchu].
0:34:9|0:34:15|Before leaving, he didn't forget to tuck in the blanket for [Chuchu], and only after everything was settled did [Sheng Nan] leave with peace of mind.
0:34:16|0:34:46|Sheng Nan's eyes bloomed with a smile, her hand holding onto her heart in the smoke, supporting you without moving, tears flowing. Changing time and space as a kind of indulgence, someone's neon lights can't reach you in this maze. Meanwhile, Yang You has already started kindergarten. The teachers are having the children form a circle and teaching them to sing.
0:34:46|0:35:0|Yang You rests his chin on his hands, swaying his body along with the music. The camera then cuts to the music company.
0:36:37|0:36:43|After that, the two of them left. The camera then cut to [Chuchu]'s home, where she was reading the letter left by [Sheng Nan].
0:36:49|0:37:7|He was sitting slanted on the sofa, with his feet propped up on the coffee table in front. After reading the letter, he smiled and took a bite of the apple, then looked ahead, contemplating something. [Sheng Nan] and Xiao Wen arrived at the classroom door, seeing [Yang Yang] happily playing with toys. [Sheng Nan] finally made a decision.
0:38:21|0:38:26|Sheng Nan smiled and patted Yang Yang's head, but a few strands of hair fell down.
0:38:35|0:38:50|Late at night, while [Yang Yang] was already fast asleep, [Sheng Nan] began to write a song. To avoid disturbing [Yang Yang]'s rest, he sat beside with a small desk lamp on, twirling the pen tip as he contemplated the lyrics. When he noticed [Yang Yang] turning over, he even turned back to tuck [Yang Yang] in properly.
0:39:37|0:39:45|He thought and thought, and then remembered the beautiful love with [Bai Jing] during their university days.
0:40:7|0:40:26|Although these experiences are vivid in her mind, [Bai Jing] has already drifted far away from them. But [Sheng Nan] is still the same person who dares to chase her dreams and refuses to give up. She wrote "I Am Still Me" in her notebook. In the blink of an eye, the paper was filled with [Sheng Nan]'s writing. She organized the lyrics and completed her creation.
0:40:29|0:40:54|The camera moves to the underground passage, with [Sheng Nan] singing her newly written song while reminiscing about the past. At this moment, [Yang Yang] also arrives next to [Sheng Nan].
0:41:45|0:41:49|The skinny man stopped and looked at [Chu Chu] next to him, who smiled and said.
0:42:12|0:42:17|[Sheng Nan] picked up the guitar and started singing, while [Yang Yang] listened attentively beside her.
0:42:56|0:43:11|The scene shifts to the villa of [Chuchu], where [Sheng Nan] is sitting on the sofa, anxiously waiting. [Chuchu] slowly walks down from upstairs and casually picks up an apple. After walking over to [Sheng Nan], [Chuchu] places her other hand on his shoulder and sits down.
0:43:47|0:43:51|[Sheng Nan] took a bite of the apple, looked to the side, and pondered for a moment.
0:44:8|0:44:22|[Sheng Nan] decisively leaves, while [Chu Chu] throws the apple in her hand towards [Sheng Nan] and sits on the sofa gloomily. The scene shifts to a restaurant, where [Yang Yang] and [Xiao Wen] are sitting in a row, with [Sheng Nan] sitting opposite them, looking at the two of them. There are three bowls of noodles on the table.
0:44:39|0:44:42|[Sheng Nan] said shamefully. [Xiao Wen] glared at her.
0:44:50|0:44:55|Yang Yang has been staring at the noodles next to her without moving for a while, Xiao Wen approached.
0:45:55|0:45:59|[Doctor] cleans up [Yang Yang]'s forehead, and [Yang Yang] falls asleep in his arms.
0:46:14|0:46:16|[Xiao Wen] patted [Yang Yang]'s shoulder and said.
0:46:23|0:46:30|Xiao Wen smiled and said, "Don't worry, little one." Then they got up and left.
0:46:36|0:46:49|The backs of the three figures gradually blur, and the camera turns to the kindergarten classroom. The children are divided into several groups, all busy learning to draw. Xiao Wen sits in [Yang Yang]'s group, patiently teaching them how to draw. [Yang Yang] is also studying earnestly.
0:46:56|0:47:3|On this side of the underground passage, [Sheng Nan] continued to sing her newly written song, while not far away, the short-haired woman was still capturing these scenes.
0:47:37|0:47:51|The skinny man sang while recalling various people and events he had recently encountered. He remembered Xiao Wen standing at the classroom door, telling him she had decided to be Yang Yang's mother, and also thought of [Chu Chu] sitting next to him listening to him sing.
0:48:5|0:48:12|The skinny man took out his phone to answer the call, while on the other end, Xiao Wen was anxiously calling him.
0:48:40|0:48:42|The director next to them made an OK gesture.
0:48:51|0:48:54|The director gestured and then happily danced away.
0:48:58|0:49:4|[Sheng Nan] walked anxiously on the street, when suddenly, her phone rang again. She quickly answered it.
0:49:9|0:49:13|[Sheng Nan] turned and jogged away, while dialing a phone number.
0:49:50|0:49:55|The scene shifts to Yang Yang's sickbed, where [Sheng Nan] begins to recall the words the doctor just said.
0:50:17|0:50:40|[Sheng Nan] stood in front of the doctor, unable to believe everything. The camera cut back to Yang Yang's bedside, [Sheng Nan] staring blankly at Yang Yang. Xiao Wen, who was beside her, glanced at her, then turned to ask. [Sheng Nan] pointed outside and left. Xiao Wen looked at Yang Yang before following her out, leaving Yang Yang alone, asleep on the hospital bed.
0:50:40|0:50:45|Outside the ward, [Sheng Nan] took out the diagnosis report and handed it to Xiao Wen.
0:50:47|0:51:1|After watching it, Xiao Wen couldn't believe everything in front of her. Beside her, Sheng Nan's eyes were already red from crying. In the hospital room, Yang Yang continued to sleep soundly, while outside Xiao Wen had already cried her eyes out, helplessly leaning on Sheng Nan's shoulder.
0:51:1|0:51:13|At this moment, [Yang Yang] on the sickbed slowly woke up. When she regained consciousness, she looked around but didn't see anyone nearby. Feeling helpless, she thought she had been abandoned by her parents again, so she cried in pain.
0:52:16|0:52:20|After speaking, Sheng Nan stood up and left, walking quietly through the hospital corridor.
0:52:24|0:52:27|The camera cuts to [Sheng Nan]'s home, and she goes to answer the door when she hears the doorbell.
0:52:31|0:52:35|Seeing [Sheng Nan], she grabbed the other person's hand and walked towards the living room.
0:52:53|0:52:57|Chuchu's smile disappeared from her face as she let go of Sheng Nan's hand.
0:53:13|0:53:16|[Chuchu] grabbed [Sheng Nan]'s hand again, but was pushed away.
0:53:23|0:53:26|[Chuchu] slapped [Sheng Nan] in the face, but soon regretted it.
0:53:39|0:53:41|[Sheng Nan] once again pulls [Chuchu]'s hand away.
0:53:50|0:54:9|Sheng Nan left angrily, [Chu Chu] sat on the sofa, and the little dog on the ground looked innocently ahead. The camera then shifted to the hospital room, where [Yang Yang] was lying on the bed. [Xiao Wen] looked at [Yang Yang], then helplessly at Sheng Nan. At that moment, [Yang Yang] slowly opened his eyes and looked towards Sheng Nan.
0:54:9|0:54:12|Sheng Nan noticed and quickly approached.
0:54:26|0:54:28|Glancing at [Xiao Wen], [Sheng Nan] then looked at [Yang Yang].
0:54:44|0:54:48|Sheng Nan tidied up Yang Yang's cheeks, put on her coat, and then left.
0:54:58|0:55:6|[Xiao Wen] picked up an apple and started peeling it for [Yang Yang]. Meanwhile, Sheng Nan carried a stack of posters to the rooftop and started putting them up everywhere.
0:55:33|0:55:43|The camera cuts back to [Yang Yang], as [Xiao Wen] peels a banana and brings it to [Yang Yang]. [Yang Yang] takes a bite, and they both laugh happily. At that moment, a nurse approaches.
0:55:57|0:56:13|The nurse left after providing the payment information. [Xiao Wen] first looked worried, then quickly adjusted her mood and continued playing with [Yang Yang]. Meanwhile, [Sheng Nan] continued to post recruitment notices everywhere, his figure visible at subway stations and bus stops.
0:56:13|0:56:18|Back in the hospital room, Xiao Wen, who had been busy all day, was already asleep leaning on the table, while Yang Yang was also fast asleep.
0:56:20|0:56:25|The scene cuts to several days later, [Xiao Wen] sits alone outside the hospital room and dials [Sheng Nan]'s phone number.
0:56:47|0:56:56|After hanging up the phone, [Xiao Wen] sat outside the ward lost in thought, while Shou Nan leaned against the wall in the underground passage, recalling the doctor's words.
0:57:18|0:57:27|[Sheng Nan] answered the phone, and the camera then cut to the hospital. He placed a jar of money on the doctor's desk.
0:57:33|0:57:36|The doctor quickly stepped forward and helped [Sheng Nan] up.
0:58:15|0:58:33|[Sheng Nan] listened and was on the verge of collapse. He slowly squatted down, covered his face with his hands, and then stood up to leave. The doctor next to him, [Bai Jing], sighed helplessly and shook his head. The camera then moved to the hospital entrance, where [Sheng Nan] had already composed himself and was coming out of the hospital with [Yang Yang].
0:58:33|0:58:36|[Xiao Wen] then followed alongside [Sheng Nan] with his guitar.
0:59:4|0:59:16|[Sheng Nan] held [Yang Yang] tightly, while [Xiao Wen] gently patted [Yang Yang]'s body before leaving. Back at home, [Yang Yang] lay on the bed, looking at the new toy, happily dancing with joy.
0:59:16|0:59:29|He picked up a beautiful [Yang Yang] style and started playing with it, sometimes putting the toy on himself, sometimes throwing it in the air. It seems like all the worries have disappeared at this moment, with pouring rain outside, [Sheng Nan] and [Xiao Wen] standing together.
0:59:54|1:0:17|[Xiao Wen] slowly turned her head, looked up, opened the umbrella, turned around and left. The mood of the two also fell into the abyss with the heavy rain. After [Xiao Wen] left, [Sheng Nan] left the sheltered eaves and walked into the heavy rain. She leaned against the fence next to her, letting the rain wash over her face.
1:0:17|1:0:32|She slowly closed her eyes, digesting the negative emotions in her heart alone. After calming down for a while, [Sheng Nan] pushed open the door of the room and entered slowly. Seeing that [Yang Yang] was already asleep, she gently closed the door again and sat down beside [Yang Yang]'s bed.
1:0:56|1:1:1|He looked up at [Yang Yang], then closed his eyes and began to recall all the moments he had experienced with [Yang Yang].
1:1:34|1:1:40|The night gradually brightened, and [Yang Yang] slowly woke up to see [Sheng Nan] sleeping on the bench. She quickly woke [Sheng Nan] up.
1:2:5|1:2:11|Sheng Nan stood up, stretched, and picked up Yang Yang's clothes to help him put them on.
1:3:53|1:4:3|[Sheng Nan] lifted [Yang Yang] over her shoulder and carried him out of the house. They arrived on the street, with [Sheng Nan] still holding [Yang Yang] as they walked forward.
1:4:19|1:4:34|The two walked forward, temporarily forgetting all their worries, until they reached a street corner. Their steps gradually slowed down, and [Yang Yang] whispered.
1:4:36|1:4:59|The skinny man stopped and put down his guitar, squatting down to support [Yang Yang]'s arm, gently rubbing [Yang Yang]'s face with concern, then slowly took out a bottle of yogurt from his bag. He inserted the straw and handed it to [Yang Yang], who started drinking it eagerly.
1:4:59|1:5:2|The skinny man picked up [Yang Yang] and walked forward again with a guitar.
1:5:4|1:5:14|In the underground passage, [Sheng Nan] continues to sing and play the guitar, while [Yang Yang] sways to the rhythm beside her. On the wall behind them, there is a missing person notice for [Yang Yang] who is critically ill and looking for her parents.
1:6:25|1:6:45|In the underground passage, most of the vendors scattered, leaving only [Sheng Nan] and the beggar. Three urban management officers slowly approached [Sheng Nan] and [Yang Yang]. [Sheng Nan] glanced down at [Yang Yang].
1:6:47|1:7:3|One of the urban management officers noticed the missing person notice on the wall, and with a command, the other two also stepped forward to take a look. The three officers took out money from their pockets, and the short-haired woman immediately started taking photos.
1:7:14|1:7:23|After the urban management officers left, the short-haired woman who had been filming closed her camera and walked up to [Yang Yang], taking out several hundred yuan bills to hand to her.
1:7:25|1:7:37|The woman patted [Yang Yang]'s head and then left. The beggar across the street shook his head at the scene, then looked at his own begging bowl. Although there wasn't much money inside, she still walked up to [Yang Yang] with the bowl.
1:7:38|1:7:44|Gave all the money in the basin to [Yang Yang] and patted [Yang Yang]'s head. [Yang Yang] also smiled and thanked him.
1:7:49|1:7:52|The scene then shifts to a bridge.
1:8:10|1:8:22|[Sheng Nan] touched [Yang Yang]'s head, only to find that a few strands of hair came off in his hand. Looking at his hand, he thought of [Yang Yang]'s worsening condition, so he hugged [Yang Yang] tightly in his arms with a heavy heart.
1:8:28|1:8:37|[Sheng Nan] took [Yang Yang]'s hand and left, arriving at a restaurant where the table was filled with various dishes. [Sheng Nan] and [Yang Yang] sat side by side.
1:8:45|1:8:58|[Yang Yang] picked up the chopsticks and started eating, while [Sheng Nan] picked up a piece of food for him and quietly watched him. Upon seeing this, [Yang Yang] also leaned warmly against [Sheng Nan] and the two smiled at each other.
1:8:59|1:9:2|[Sheng Nan] was picking up dishes when she accidentally saw [Chu Chu] drinking alone at the table.
1:9:36|1:9:44|[Chuchu] gave [Sheng Nan] a glare, left a hundred bucks for the boss, and walked away. Sheng Nan shook her head as she watched her go.
1:10:9|1:10:15|The camera cuts to a hotel, where [Yang Yang] excitedly runs in with a thin man following behind.
1:10:43|1:10:59|[Yang Yang] happily bounces on the big bed. In the amusement park, [Sheng Nan] holds [Yang Yang] and stands with Xiao Wen to take a group photo. Their faces also show long-lost smiles. Afterwards, they finish exploring all the attractions with [Yang Yang].
1:11:33|1:11:36|As night fell, they arrived at the overpass to celebrate [Yang Yang]'s birthday.
1:11:50|1:12:6|[Sheng Nan] held [Yang Yang] in the middle, with a crown on his head, turned his head and kissed Xiao Wen, surrounded by a circle of people singing and celebrating Yang Yang's birthday. Some of them were holding guitars, some were clapping their hands, all in their own way to make Yang Yang happy.
1:12:6|1:12:18|The camera slowly rises, with a huge birthday cake placed beside them. The three urban management officers who had donated money to [Yang Yang] before were not far away, clapping their hands for [Yang Yang] and singing a birthday song for her with great care.
1:13:34|1:13:49|The scene cuts to the computer screen at the music company, where the female employee also sees the footage of everyone celebrating [Yang Yang]'s birthday online. Just as she is touched, the music director walks in with a contract.
1:13:51|1:14:1|[Sheng Nan] walked in slowly, placed a stack of money on the front desk, the manager glanced at the money and then at [Sheng Nan] persistently, and then said arrogantly.
1:14:16|1:14:20|The director was first a little surprised, and then said indifferently.
1:14:23|1:14:30|The director took the money and walked away. Sheng Nan glanced at him indifferently, looking very tired. The female employee smiled and nodded at Sheng Nan.
1:14:52|1:15:10|Sheng Nan responded and then turned to leave. The camera then cuts to the outside of the house rented by [Sheng Nan], with the landlord locking the door and leaving. Not far away, [Sheng Nan] and Xiao Wen slowly walk forward with their luggage, but after only a few steps, they stop. Xiao Wen speaks up with a heavy heart.
1:15:23|1:15:41|Sheng Nan was about to leave, but Xiao Wen couldn't bear it and grabbed Sheng Nan's arm. Sheng Nan slowly turned around, looking at Xiao Wen with a vacant expression. Xiao Wen gazed back at him firmly. After a long moment of eye contact, Sheng Nan took out a photo from his bag. Xiao Wen accepted the photo, and Sheng Nan then turned and walked away.
1:15:41|1:15:57|Only Xiao Wen was left standing alone in place, watching Sheng Nan leave in a daze. He then shifted his gaze to the photo, the camera slowly zooming in. It was a picture of them at the amusement park with [Bai Jing], their only remaining beautiful memory.
1:15:57|1:16:14|At this moment, although [Yang Yang] is no longer in this world, their feelings will always endure. In the underground passage, [Yang Yang]'s mother walks forward alone, helpless, as the crowd passes by bustling, but there is no one she cares about, and no one comes to care for her.
1:16:14|1:16:30|When Bing Ling collapsed, he leaned against the wall in the underground passage, hitting his own head, and then burst into tears. Soon, he inadvertently saw a missing person notice posted on the wall. Upon discovering Yang Yang drawn on it, he tore the notice off as if he had found a treasure.
1:16:30|1:16:47|After looking at the information in front of him several times, he finally confirmed that it was about Yang Yang. He put the missing person notice in his arms and excitedly read it over and over again. After thinking for a while, he finally had a goal and left the underground passage. The camera then shifted to Sheng Nan's side, where he placed the suitcase and guitar in front of him.
1:16:47|1:16:50|A person stands on a pedestrian bridge, staring blankly at the traffic flow in the distance.
1:17:4|1:17:8|[Sheng Nan] choked up, held back from saying anything, and then hung up the phone. Seeing the other end remain silent and hang up, Yang Yang's mother finally realized that Yang Yang may have passed away.
1:17:34|1:17:43|He bent over and squatted on the ground, crying uncontrollably next to the phone booth, the student's note in his hand crumpled into a ball.
1:17:43|1:17:55|Tears streamed down his face, turning [Yang Yang] into a permanent knot in his heart. At this moment, even if he regretted it again, he could not go back to the day they abandoned [Yang Yang], nor could he make a different choice.
1:17:56|1:18:8|[Sheng Nan] was about to leave when she turned around and saw Xiao Wen standing in front of her. They stood facing each other on the overpass for a long time. Finally, Xiao Wen spoke.
1:18:15|1:18:18|[Sheng Nan] sighed and looked into the distance.
1:18:27|1:18:31|The two turned around and looked at the man who was speaking.
1:18:37|1:18:40|[Xiao Wen] looked at [Sheng Nan], and [Sheng Nan] lowered her head.
1:19:1|1:19:15|The man took out a business card and handed it to [Sheng Nan], revealing himself as the boss behind the music company. After speaking, the man turned and walked away, leaving [Sheng Nan] to look at the business card.
1:19:24|1:19:44|[Sheng Nan] and Xiao Wen watched the man walk away, then looked at each other. Sheng Nan turned to look at the traffic in the distance, while Xiao Wen walked over to stand side by side with him. After a long silence, Xiao Wen finally gathered the courage to hold Sheng Nan's hand. Sheng Nan did not refuse. They turned their heads and looked at each other.
1:19:44|1:19:49|At this moment, the camera slowly rises and pans towards the bustling streets of Beijing.
