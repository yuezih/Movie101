0:0:39|0:0:49|The film officially begins, a luxurious small car slowly approaches, the road winding and twisting, the small car circling around the mountain top, driving up in circles.
0:0:49|0:1:9|On one side of the road is a towering and steep cliff, while on the other side is a low-line gorge. The roaring car speeds along the mountain road, stirring up the dry branches and leaves on the ground. The dry leaves swirl in the air, resembling dancing butterflies. The road is surrounded by mountains, with forests and scattered raindrops on both sides. In the distance, the sounds of insects and birds overlap, all lush and green.
0:1:10|0:1:26|The camera pulls back to reveal a canyon with lakes rippling in circles. Amidst the fragrant flowers and trees, the car accelerates towards its destination without hesitation. As the speed gradually decreases, it signals the imminent arrival at the destination.
0:1:26|0:1:36|After a while, the small car drove into the village, where several men stood by the roadside welcoming them. The men waved their hands and hurriedly opened their umbrellas.
0:1:56|0:2:2|The man who took off his makeup and changed his shoes was surrounded by a crowd, while four women next to him were playing mahjong in a low voice.
0:2:44|0:2:50|The fourth brother [Zhang Bei] is the director of the flour factory, and the fifth brother [Zhang Zhong] is a big bully in the village.
0:3:9|0:3:25|A lush vegetation surrounds the winding corridor that comes into view. The crowd gathers around [Zhang Dong] and enters the corridor. At the end of the corridor is a magnificent mansion. The rooms are built against the mountain, and the interior decoration exudes grandeur.
0:4:9|0:4:13|[Zhang Nan] brushed the documents on the table and took off the sunglasses from his face.
0:4:48|0:4:58|Xiao Huo took the phone. He looked at the phone with a smile, by the pond in the village, [Lin Chunhu] and the villagers were checking on the side.
0:5:4|0:5:11|If the water quality is a problem, [Lin Chunhu] hurriedly ran out, while the old lady stood calmly on the roof.
0:5:35|0:5:46|The villagers quickly picked up a basin of straw and piled up thick protective pads under the house. The villagers looked up at the old lady, and [Lin Genxing] knelt down without saying a word, looking at his mother.
0:6:36|0:6:40|The old lady squatted down, tears streaming down her face. [Lin Chunhu] took the document handed to him.
0:10:14|0:10:27|The two brothers nodded with a look of shame on their faces. In the village, the narrow alleys were filled with traces of time, presenting a peaceful scene. [Secretary Lao] and others walked out of the village committee with smiles on their faces, welcoming the arrival of [Village Chief Yang].
0:12:37|0:12:49|In the lush forest, a stream meandered through the middle, with several figures cautiously making their way through the trees.
0:13:7|0:13:14|[Zhang Xiaobao] hurried forward, looking for a good angle. [Liu Mengting] walked carefully to the west side and sat on a rock.
0:13:26|0:13:28|[Liu Mengting] stood up and walked to [Zhang Xiaobao]'s side.
0:14:11|0:14:13|[Liu Mengting] looked down at the negatives in the camera.
0:14:27|0:14:37|[Liu Mengting] turned around with a pout and walked away, [Zhang Xiaobao] scratched his head and quickly caught up. The two figures disappeared into the woods.
0:15:43|0:16:2|[Liu Mengting] interrupted [Zhang Xiaobao]'s words, and the two walked towards the village. The quiet and quaint alley was deep and narrow, with an old man sitting quietly on a chair in front of his house. The medicine jars inside the house were steaming on the fire. [Liu Mengting] lifted the medicine jar with both hands and poured the medicine into a bowl, then carried the bowl in her hands and walked out of the kitchen.
0:16:2|0:16:4|She sat by [Liu Mengting]'s bed.
0:16:13|0:16:20|[Liu Mengting] blows on the cooling medicine and feeds it to Auntie. [Zhang Xiaobao] stands by with a camera, capturing [Liu Mengting].
0:17:12|0:17:16|A man is holding a pig's head to cover his face.
0:18:6|0:18:10|The two households living there were so scared that they refused to move out.
0:18:54|0:18:59|[Zhang Dong] pursed his lips, looking at [Zhang Baoliang] in front of him with a serious expression.
0:20:3|0:20:8|[Zhang Nan] raised his hand, stopping [Zhang Baoliang] from speaking, and thought for a moment.
0:20:18|0:20:24|[Zhang Baoliang] looked affectionately at [Lin Dong], and the two walked out of the room together, while the villagers walked in groups of two or three on the other side.
0:20:50|0:20:52|[Zhang Nan] hurriedly went up to greet [Village Chief Yang].
0:21:31|0:21:40|[Liu Mengting] led everyone down the stone bridge, the surrounding scenery was picturesque. Just as everyone was hurrying towards the election assembly, [Lin Chunhu] hurriedly ran from around the corner.
0:22:59|0:23:2|The scene shifts, with [Lin Chunhu] leading [Zhang Nan] around for a tour.
0:24:56|0:25:5|The two walked along the path, chatting and laughing. [The Old Secretary] did not answer the question just now. The next morning, [The Old Secretary] arranged to meet [Lin Chunhu] in the corridor.
0:26:0|0:26:2|Lin Chunhu was at a loss for words and didn't know how to respond.
0:26:58|0:27:6|[Lin Chunhu] returned to his office with a turtle in his hand, sitting on the office chair and looking at the turtle on the desk.
0:27:24|0:27:42|[Liu Mengting] couldn't help but sigh, then reached out to pick up the turtle on the table. She carefully inspected it, but found nothing unusual. Suddenly she thought of something, quickly put down the turtle, clapped her hands, took out her phone and dialed a number, putting it to her ear.
0:28:7|0:28:10|[Liu Mengting] is collecting water from the pond with a bottle.
0:28:23|0:28:31|A few years ago, we also used the water in the stream, with [Lin Chunhu] looking worried, in the luxurious villa on the other side.
0:28:45|0:28:48|[Zhang Nan] looked up with an unwavering expression, lost in thought.
0:29:14|0:29:20|By the pond, [Liu Mengting] anxiously holds a report and hurries towards [Lin Chunhu] standing on the path in the middle of the pond.
0:30:5|0:30:17|In the restaurant, the [Zhang brothers] gathered stylishly to have a meal, raising their heads to look at the wine in their cups. After [Zhang Dong] sat down, he hesitated for a moment and spoke.
0:31:25|0:31:30|[Lin Chunhu] drank up the wine in his hand without hesitation.
0:31:34|0:31:58|[Zhang Nan] spoke up to stop his younger brother. He glanced at the younger brother beside him and gestured towards him. The younger brother immediately understood, got up and walked out of the room. [Zhang Nan] smiled and looked at [Liu Mengting] and [Lin Chunhu], then adjusted his suit.
0:34:25|0:34:30|[Zhang Dong] looked at the backs of the two people and shook his head mockingly. He picked up his phone from the car, dialed a number, and waited for a moment.
0:35:0|0:35:8|[Lin Chunhu] and [Zhang Nan] were filled with worry. Uncle Bao rushed forward anxiously, pointing at the two of them.
0:35:21|0:35:36|Lin Chunhu arrogantly made threats, saying he would tear up the test report in his hand. He threw the paper scraps on the faces of the two, then threw them again in anger. [Lin Chunhu] pointed at him, but he ignored and left angrily.
0:36:23|0:36:27|The five brothers in their family, Lin Chunhu and Zhang Nan, became even more lawless.
0:36:39|0:36:42|Returning home, Lin Chunhu still had a look of anger on his face.
0:37:59|0:38:5|The scene changes, Lin Mengting walks quickly on the bridge, Zhang Xiaobao catches up and shouts. He reaches out and grabs Lin Mengting's arm.
0:39:7|0:39:18|Liu Mengting left in frustration, while [Zhang Nan] stood still behind her, at a loss. [Lin Chunhu] held a gift, opened the courtyard gate, and looked around shouting.
0:39:22|0:39:32|[Lin Genxing] poked his head out of the room. [Zhang Xi] walked towards the table in the courtyard and placed the gift in his hand on the table.
0:40:13|0:40:22|[Lin Genxing] sees [Zhang Xi] off, looking at the gifts on the table with a big smile on his face. He opens the package, takes out the drink inside, and is about to open it when it is pressed down by a plank.
0:41:32|0:41:46|[Lin Genxing] walked out of the yard with an unopened bottle of milk, looking at the hundred yuan his father gave him. After saying that, he put the money in his pocket and left. On the other side, the woman was sweeping the yard with an ugly expression.
0:42:30|0:42:40|The man walked into the house with a gift, while his wife continued to clean the yard. In the home of [Zhang Baoliang], he wore an apron and carried delicious food, then leaned in for a kiss, very satisfied.
0:42:57|0:43:5|[Lin Chunhu] sat down and watched the entrance of the restaurant. His son walked in slowly with a camera in his hand.
0:44:0|0:44:2|[Lin Chunhu] looks at his son who remains silent.
0:44:7|0:44:9|The son picked up the camera and handed it to [Lin Chunhu].
0:44:27|0:44:40|[Lin Chunhu] flipped through the photos in the camera and happened to see the scene where Chunhu was giving the bun to Aunt He. [Lin Chunhu] looked shocked, glanced at his son, and stared at the photo with a serious expression, lost in thought.
0:44:40|0:44:48|Some time later, the village committee officially started the election meeting for the party branch. The villagers sat below the stage discussing in a flurry.
0:45:51|0:45:53|[Zhang Nan] stood up under the push of [Zhang Xi].
0:45:58|0:46:12|[Zhang Nan] walked out with sunglasses on, hands in pockets, and his younger brother sat back in his seat. [Zhang Nan] swaggered up the steps, nonchalantly, taking a glance at the judges on the stage with a disdainful attitude, walking along the edge of the podium.
0:46:12|0:46:24|He exhaled, then took off the sunglasses on his face, glanced back at [Secretary Lao] and others sitting behind him, and then hung the sunglasses in the pocket on his chest. With his hands on his waist, he walked in the middle of the stage.
0:47:36|0:47:39|Applause rang out as many villagers shook their heads.
0:49:21|0:49:48|The young man hung up the phone while driving, then suddenly accelerated, swiftly weaving through the village. [Lin Chunhu] smiled and waved to the villagers, then walked up to the stage. He respectfully and humbly bowed to the judges, then turned around and bowed to the villagers.
0:52:11|0:52:30|The villagers one by one stepped forward to receive their ballot papers. At the writing table, the old man carefully filled out his ballot paper. After finishing, he took off his glasses, held the ballot paper, and turned to leave. The next person sat down in his place. [Zhang Nan] stood on tiptoe, wanting to see what was going on, but was pushed down.
0:52:30|0:52:39|[Secretary Lao] took the lead in casting his ballot into the ballot box. The villagers also followed suit and cast their votes one after another. The scene was orderly and organized.
0:53:40|0:53:47|Accompanied by the applause of the villagers, the five people stood up and walked towards the stage, with [Lin Chunhu] leading the way as his younger brother [Zhang Dong] ran into the village committee with a photo.
0:54:14|0:54:16|The purpose is to win in this election.
0:54:37|0:54:41|I finally caught a glimpse of [Zhang Nan], and I saw her giving a gift to [Ma Dongmei].
0:57:14|0:57:21|[Village Chief Yang] heard the news, got up and walked to the door, where he saw two elderly people. He hurriedly went up to greet them, and the old people held his hand.
0:58:31|0:58:37|Village Chief Yang pondered as he watched the old man's back, while on the other side, Lin Dong was still hosting a grand banquet.
0:58:54|0:58:57|[Zhang Dong] raised his glass to toast the brothers at the table.
0:59:23|0:59:26|[Lin Chunhu] has been disqualified again.
0:59:39|0:59:41|[Zhang Nan] raised his hand to stop everyone.
1:1:6|1:1:13|[Liu Mengting] throws the photo towards [Zhang Xiaobao]. [Zhang Xiaobao] looks at the photo in confusion.
1:1:42|1:1:46|[Liu Mengting] turned her back to [Zhang Xiaobao] in frustration, and [Zhang Xiaobao] grabbed [Liu Mengting] and turned her around.
1:2:2|1:2:5|[Zhang Xiaobao] anxiously shifted his feet, unsure of how to explain.
1:2:29|1:2:45|After saying that, [Zhang Nan] left the bamboo forest without looking back. [Liu Mengting] stood still, feeling lost, and slowly squatted down, staring blankly. Little Bao's figure gradually disappeared into the bamboo forest. At the [Zhang Baoliang] household, the whale swam carefreely in the fish tank.
1:2:45|1:2:58|[Zhang Nan] bent down to look at the whale, and Xiao Bao flashed past him from behind. [Zhang Nan] turned his head to look, shook his head, and continued to cheerfully watch the whale. At this moment, Xiao Bao quickly ran down the stairs.
1:3:28|1:3:30|[Zhang Baoliang] turned around and sat on the stool, picking up the newspaper.
1:4:48|1:4:51|[Zhang Baoliang] took out the camera from under the table, Little Bao snatched it away and left.
1:5:8|1:5:29|Little Bao, ignoring his father's reprimand behind him, walked out of the house without looking back, with a determined and resolute expression. He carried his camera through the quaint alleys, not daring to stop for a moment. Hurrying out of the alley, his expression was anxious and urgent. He ran through the village and finally stepped into the gate of the village committee.
1:5:29|1:5:32|At this moment, [Village Chief Yang] was also talking to the villagers to understand the situation.
1:5:57|1:6:2|Village Chief Yang looked at the photos in his camera, and the truth about the selection was finally revealed.
1:6:16|1:6:23|Our village investigation team conducted a comprehensive investigation into this matter.
1:6:28|1:6:35|After various investigations, this [Lin Chunhu] did not exhibit any suspicious behavior.
1:6:53|1:7:0|Confirming him as the candidate for the new village party branch secretary of our Camellia Village.
1:7:12|1:7:20|One of the candidates [Zhang Dong] exhibited behavior that would make him a suitable choice.
1:7:29|1:7:31|Revoke his position as the deputy party secretary this time.
1:7:43|1:7:54|[Zhang Nan] got up and left. On the other side, [Lin Chunhu] drove with a heavy expression, not saying a word, while his younger brother sat nervously beside him.
1:8:10|1:8:17|The younger brother opened the car door and got out, looking at [Zhang Dong] inside the car. The car started and drove away.
1:8:20|1:8:37|Lin Chunhu watched as Zhang Nan's car gradually drove away. Zhang Nan was driving alone on the road, appearing calm, while Xu Ze was furious. The car slowly pulled over to the side of the road, he opened the door and got out, forcefully slammed the door shut, spun around, and then kicked the door hard.
1:8:37|1:8:53|He leaned against the car door, banging his head hard against the door frame. From then on, the village truly regained its calm. The quaint buildings still stood in the village, with lanterns swaying gently in the wind under the eaves. On the other side, [Liu Mengting] was providing scientific knowledge for the villagers.
1:10:42|1:10:45|[Liu Mengting] smiled as she escorted the villagers away.
1:11:16|1:11:29|[Lin Chunhu] handed the ticket to [Zhang Nan], who lowered her head to look at the beautiful ticket for the rural photography exhibition in her hand. In the blink of an eye, she stepped through the entrance of the exhibition, gazing at the photos covering the walls, feeling endless emotions in her heart.
1:11:29|1:11:37|In the center of the photo is her figure, she walks to her photo and looks at it quietly, the smiling expression in the photo is very infectious.
1:11:38|1:11:49|At this moment, [Zhang Nan] also appeared behind [Liu Mengting]. [Zhang Nan] stood behind without saying a word. [Liu Mengting] turned around to look at [Zhang Nan] behind her, the silence between them spoke louder than words.
1:11:49|1:12:4|[Zhang Xiaobao] smiled at [Liu Mengting], but the love in her eyes gradually faded. [Liu Mengting] looked at her with a genuine smile, and the two of them let go of their past grievances. There was no more resentment in their hearts, life continued moving forward, and the future was full of brightness.
