0:2:48|0:3:9|In the feudal and dark ages ruled by Yan Xishan in Shanxi, in the impoverished and hungry old society, the childhood of Liu Hulan began early labor. In the fields, Liu Hulan plowed the land together with a donkey and Grandfather.
0:3:16|0:3:31|[Liu Hulan] started playing in the fields, squatting on the ground and touching the soil with both hands. Standing up, [Grandfather] pointed at him with a cane.
0:3:43|0:3:48|[Liu Hulan] pushed aside her bangs and glared at [Grandfather]. [Liu's Mom] walked over.
0:3:58|0:4:4|[Liu Hulan] ran towards [Liu's Dad], and [Grandfather], who was still working, turned his head to look at him.
0:4:12|0:4:33|The neighbor patted [Liu Hulan]'s shoulder, and [Liu's Mom] also walked over. Guihua and a group of children ran over.
0:4:44|0:4:57|[Liu Hulan] embraced Guihua, and the neighbor's son Xiaoqing followed. [Liu's Mom] watched the children's backs as they walked confidently into the distance.
0:5:2|0:5:25|They arrived at the harvested farmland, bowing their heads and searching around. When they saw scattered bones, they picked them up and put them in their baskets. Not far away, farmers were still harvesting wheat. Landlord [Lu Shanqing] with a pipe in his mouth, arrived at the farmland with his wife.
0:5:25|0:5:30|They looked at the children in confusion, and Guihua and a boy suddenly started fighting over something.
0:5:40|0:5:59|[Liu Hulan] took the pipe out of his mouth and walked towards them. [Liu Hulan] turned around and looked at [Liu's Mom]. [Liu's Mom] and his wife kept getting closer, while the other children all stepped back several steps. Only [Liu Hulan] stood still without fear, glaring at [Liu's Mom].
0:6:4|0:6:31|Guihua Mei put down the basket, and [Liu Hulan] picked it up again, carrying it on her arm. When the lady tried to snatch it, she slapped [Liu Hulan], who brushed aside her bangs and glared at her in anger. [LÃ¼ Shanqing]'s henchman ran over from a distance.
0:6:38|0:6:55|[Lv Shanqing] quickly called his wife to run together, the farmers on the side stopped to watch them, and the children took two steps forward. [Liu Hulan] turned around and waved his hand, the children followed him and walked forward. In the fields, Shi Dehui ran towards [Liu Hulan]'s father.
0:7:7|0:7:19|In the village, the villagers are running home with their children. At the doorstep of landlord Lv Shanqing's house, several servants are loading luggage onto a donkey cart and tying them up.
0:7:24|0:7:53|[Liu Hulan] and the children also returned to the village, stopping by the donkey cart. The children all watched the busy helpers, while [Liu Hulan] kept giving them sidelong glances. The lackey gestured for the helpers to go ahead, and he led another sedan chair to the door, while Lv Shanqing came out of the house carrying a box.
0:7:56|0:8:19|Mrs. hurried to catch up and then stopped. The Red Army was marching in an orderly line towards the village. Lv Shanqing had already sat in the carriage. Mrs. came out, threw the jewelry box and bundle into the carriage, and sat down as well.
0:8:20|0:8:33|The lackey drove the carriage away, [Liu Hulan] picked up a piece of dirt from the ground and threw it at the carriage. Li Shanqing stuck his head out of the carriage and glared at him, while the children jumped and clapped. The carriage gradually drove away.
0:8:38|0:8:51|The children stopped and the Red Army entered the village. The children turned around and walked towards the Red Army. Several children's parents ran over to take them away. [Liu's Mom] also rushed back and was about to take [Liu Hulan] away.
0:9:15|0:9:31|The instructor squatted in front of him. The instructor picked up [Liu Hulan]. [Liu Hulan] touched the soldier's cap. A soldier ran over.
0:9:34|0:9:39|Sun Instructor put down [Liu Hulan], who ran to her mother with a smile. Shi Dehui struck a large bell.
0:9:59|0:10:3|The villagers gathered together, with the village leader looking at everyone.
0:10:49|0:11:8|The villagers were all smiles as the Red Army soldiers distributed food to everyone. [Grandfather] happily carried a bag of food he received. Instructor Sun put his arm around [Liu Hulan] and chatted and laughed with Shi Dehui.
0:11:8|0:11:16|A villager excitedly shook hands with [Liu Hulan], Grandfather smiled with his pipe in hand, and Shi Dehui couldn't help but show a happy smile.
0:11:18|0:11:35|Red Army soldiers lined up and left, villagers bid farewell. Grandfather walked hand in hand with a soldier, while Comrade Sun stopped to say goodbye to the villagers following behind, then patted Liu Hulan's head before continuing to march with the troops.
0:11:35|0:11:41|[Liu Hulan] chased after him, Instructor Sun picked him up, comforted him, then put him down, waving goodbye to the villagers.
0:11:52|0:12:10|One day, Liu Hulan's mother was pushing the stone mill in the courtyard, round after round. She wiped the sweat with the towel on her shoulder, stopped and smiled at the door.
0:12:12|0:12:34|[Liu Hulan] ran back with many bamboo poles in her arms. She placed the poles outside the donkey shed, broke off a small piece, and offered it to the donkey's mouth, then took it away and offered it again, playing with the donkey. Mom smiled as she watched [Liu Hulan], who then patted the donkey's head.
0:12:35|0:12:37|[Liu Hulan] turned and smiled, bouncing towards her mother.
0:12:44|0:13:9|[Liu Hulan] stood beside her mother, pushing the cart together for ten years. Her small stature didn't even reach her mother's shoulder. Along the tragic path of rural women in China for thousands of years, [Liu Hulan] grew up gradually.
0:13:11|0:13:39|Grown-up [Liu Hulan] is still pushing the stone mill in the courtyard with her mother, circling around. [Liu Hulan] has grown taller, while her mother has aged a lot. Her mother stops to wipe away the sweat. With one hand holding a small spindle, she gathers the grains to the center, while using the other hand to help her daughter push the millstone.
0:13:39|0:13:41|She walked side by side with her daughter again.
0:13:47|0:14:5|Grandfather walked out of the house, carrying a basket and leaning on a cane, sitting down on the side and starting to twist a rope with old grass. Guihua and her mother walked out of the house and approached Liu Hulan's Grandfather when they saw him.
0:14:20|0:14:36|Guihua took the donkey whip off the wall and ran to Xiaoqing's side. Xiaoqing took the whip, and Guihua helped her brother check the donkey's body. Xiaoqing led the donkey to the front of [Liu Hulan]'s grandfather.
0:14:47|0:14:49|Upon hearing this, [Liu Hulan] gave a glare.
0:15:56|0:15:59|Mom walked into the room, [Liu Hulan] with a stern face, preparing the donkey saddle.
0:16:4|0:16:6|[Grandfather] stood up and walked towards him.
0:16:11|0:16:14|In the house, [Liu's Father] lay on the bed and said.
0:16:38|0:16:41|Liu's Mom hurriedly ran to the courtyard and grabbed the donkey rope.
0:16:48|0:16:50|[Liu Hulan] pulled the donkey rope and walked away.
0:16:59|0:17:19|Xiaoqing led the donkey away, with Guihua helping her with the bamboo basket on the donkey's back. [Liu's Mom] looked on with worry, while [Grandfather] and Xiaoqing's mother also watched their figures recede. [Liu Hulan] walked ahead, with each of them leading a donkey as they walked towards the village.
0:17:19|0:17:48|The villagers were busy, and two black pigs leisurely walked on the road, moving away from them. The two of them then walked together, embarking on a long journey. In winter, they arrived at a forest where the trees were bare. [Liu Hulan] led the donkey downhill and uphill, crossed a large ditch, with Xiaoqing following behind.
0:17:55|0:18:9|On the snowy ground, Xiaoqing led the donkey in front, its hooves slipping constantly. Xiaoqing turned to look at [Liu Hulan], who steadily followed, leading the donkey with assurance as its hooves occasionally slipped.
0:18:18|0:18:39|In the summer, in the same grove of trees, with the trees now lush, [Liu Hulan] and Xiaoqing were leading the donkey loaded with bamboo poles, crossing the same big ditch as before. As they climbed the slope, the side of the donkey's back carrying the bamboo poles had been pressed down significantly.
0:18:39|0:18:45|They continued to walk back, with [Liu Hulan] riding on the back of a donkey, Xiaoqing urging her own donkey with a whip.
0:18:50|0:19:11|[Liu Hulan] dismounted from the donkey and led it forward. The clouds were thick, the weather was hot and humid, with only a few gentle breezes swaying the leaves of the trees. They tied the donkey to a few large trees ahead.
0:19:11|0:19:19|[Liu Hulan] rolled up his pants legs, feeling exhausted. He walked to the shade of a tree and sat down, using the hem of his shirt to fan himself.
0:19:27|0:19:37|Xiaoqing also sat down beside him, took off the towel wrapped around his head, and wiped the sweat off.
0:20:24|0:20:33|[Liu Hulan] thought for a moment. Xiaoqing's eyes were determined.
0:20:35|0:20:50|The two looked towards the direction of the donkey, which was untangling the rope tied to the tree. Xiaoqing ran over to hold the donkey, [Liu Hulan] followed and took a look. He turned around and looked up at the sky, the wind grew stronger, blowing the leaves violently shaking, dark clouds drifting over.
0:20:54|0:21:7|At home, Grandfather also looked up at the sky, and the clothesline behind him swung vigorously. Liu's Mom, Xiaoqing's Mom, and Guifang hurried to collect the clothes. Liu's Mom returned to the courtyard with a hoe, and everyone gathered around.
0:21:49|0:22:7|It started raining heavily, and many villagers in the village were running out with their belongings. [Liu Hulan] and Xiaoqing were pulling a donkey against the flow of people. The lackey of landlord Lv Shanqing was struggling to pull the carriage, and the two happened to run into him. The lackey used a whip to lash their donkey, and [Liu Hulan] glared at him.
0:22:8|0:22:22|Lv Shanqing lifted the curtain and looked out from the carriage. Upon catching a glimpse of [Liu Hulan], he bypassed them. Lv Shanqing dropped the curtain, and the lackey continued to lead the carriage forward. The two turned their heads to look at them, then pulled the donkey to continue walking back.
0:22:49|0:23:5|[Liu's Father] and Liu's Mom walked out of the house. They returned to the house, and Mom wiped the rainwater off [Liu Hulan].
0:23:15|0:23:42|On the other side, Liu Hulan watched the village chief's appointment and burst into laughter. His wife sat beside him fanning him, while the lackey handed him a large tobacco pipe. Liu Hulan suppressed his smile and looked at the lackey. The Japanese Imperial Army sent down two thousand catties of flour, to be delivered within three days. The lackey lit a small pipe. A knock on the door caught the attention of the three. The lackey went out.
0:24:30|0:24:34|Hearing a voice, the two put away their smiles, looked at each other in confusion, and [Liu's Mom] walked in.
0:24:44|0:25:5|[Liu's Mom] took off her hat. Lv Shanqing picked up the appointment letter, looked at the lady, thought for a moment, and said to [Liu's Mom]. Lv Shanqing handed the appointment letter and the big pipe to [Liu's Mom], then, with hands behind his back, paused for a moment and walked out.
0:25:9|0:25:31|He walked to the living room door, looked through the door curtain, and saw a person holding a notebook. The notebook read, "Lv Shanqing, landlord, village head of Xicun, Yunzhou, cunning and deceitful, serving his own interests, always riding on the necks of the masses. According to the information, he is suspected of colluding with the Japanese devils, making it difficult to unite with this person."
0:25:31|0:25:38|The man put down the notebook, and Lv Shanqing walked into the living room with a smile.
0:25:45|0:25:52|[Grandfather] put the notebook in his pocket. The two sat down, while another comrade stood by.
0:26:13|0:26:26|Lawyer Lu stood up, took a teacup and poured a glass of water for [Grandfather]. Lawyer Lu then sat down.
0:27:14|0:27:24|The lackey walked in with wine and food. Comrade Sun stood up. Another comrade followed him.
0:27:40|0:28:5|[Liu Hulan] signaled with his eyes, and the lackey followed. He smiled and watched the two leave, nodding at them. After the two left the living room, [Liu Hulan]'s smile disappeared. He paced back and forth in the living room with his hands behind his back. He furrowed his brow and glared in the direction of the door.
0:29:58|0:30:14|In the village of Yunzhou West, the Anti-Japanese Village Office was established, and the villagers were very happy. They walked in groups into the village office. In the office, Shi Dehui handed a piece of paper with writing on it to a villager. The villager took the paper and walked to the side, looking at it with a joyful expression.
0:30:18|0:30:42|In the room, there was a paper on the wall with the words "Militia guards, young men happily polishing their gun barrels." On the other side, [Liu Hulan] borrowed a stack of fabric brought by Guifengmei, and the women were all sewing and mending. Guifengmei sat down, looking at the wall where a notice was written, stating that fifty sets of military uniforms must be completed within five days, and the old meeting would be held on June 2nd.
0:30:44|0:31:5|One day, a Eighth Route Army comrade wrote a message on paper and handed it to [Liu Hulan]. [Liu Hulan] then wrote "I love my country" with a brush according to the paper. Afterwards, [Liu Hulan] taught women to recognize characters, and on the blackboard it was written "Long live the Communist Party of China".
0:31:15|0:31:21|In the room, [Liu Hulan] ponders over the conversation with his wife and the informant, holding his hands.
0:31:48|0:32:10|Lv Shanqing paced back and forth, deep in thought, then slammed his fist on the table. In the village, Grandfather lit a lamp with a match, illuminating the surroundings. Some villagers were bidding farewell to their sons.
0:32:16|0:32:31|Shi Dehui walked over, a militiaman asked, Liu's Mom also sent Xiaoqing out with everyone, and Guihua helped her brother carry the luggage.
0:32:44|0:33:10|Three of them walked away from home. They walked side by side on the road, with Guihuamei standing in the middle. She smiled and looked at [Liu Hulan], handing the bundle to her. Guihuamei left, and the two watched her figure disappear.
0:33:13|0:33:27|Xiaoqing turned to look at [Liu Hulan], and the two of them continued to walk forward.
0:33:32|0:33:36|The two stopped in their tracks, [Liu Hulan] looked at Xiaoqing.
0:33:52|0:33:56|[Liu Hulan] shyly lowers her head.
0:34:28|0:34:43|Shi Dehui walked over, [Liu Hulan] and Xiaoqing glanced at each other. Shi Dehui took out a piece of paper and handed it to Xiaoqing. It was a letter of introduction. Now it's time to gather the team and get ready to set off.
0:35:0|0:35:6|Xiaoqing left with her bundle, and [Liu Hulan] followed.
0:35:14|0:35:22|Shi Dehui stopped, [Liu Hulan] caught up. When she reached Shi Dehui, he lowered his head again.
0:35:42|0:36:8|[Liu Hulan] turned around in despair, with her back facing Shi Dehui. As [Liu Hulan] turned around, Shi Dehui glanced into the distance. The two walked over together. Inside Lv Shanqing's house, he and his wife were packing up things, getting ready to leave.
0:36:17|0:36:36|Liu Hulan looked at a piece of paper, then folded it up and walked over to the henchman. The lady kept gesturing anxiously, while Liu Hulan was getting impatient. The henchman cautiously opened the door, slowly peeked out, and looked around vigilantly.
0:36:43|0:37:0|He walked out to take a look, then hurried back to close the door. At this moment, Shi Dehui, along with Xiaoqing and others, walked outside and happened to pass by Lv Shanqing's house. The patrolling militia ran into them.
0:37:16|0:37:40|After everyone had passed by, the lackey sneaked out again and peeked around the pillar. After confirming no one was around, he put on his hat and waved to signal [Liu Hulan] to come out. [Liu Hulan] cautiously emerged, with his wife following behind.
0:37:41|0:37:57|Lv Shanqing pushed the henchman forward, but accidentally bumped into his wife. The bundle fell to the ground, and he quickly picked it up. His wife linked arms with Lv Shanqing, and the two of them, alert to their surroundings, followed the henchman and fled together.
0:38:8|0:38:33|The barking of a dog attracted Shi Xingwang's attention. He turned around and saw the door of the Lv Shanqing family open, so he ran over and went in to check. Soon after, Shi Xingwang ran out and looked around. Shi Dehui, Liu Hulan, and Guihua Meimei had just returned after seeing off Xiao Qing. Shi Xingwang ran over to them.
0:38:35|0:38:42|[Shi Dehui] and the others took a few steps forward and looked into the house. Hearing a dog barking, they turned their heads to look over.
0:38:46|0:39:1|[Shi Dehui] and [Shi Xingwang] left, [Liu Hulan] and Guifhua followed a few steps, stopped and looked at their backs. The two frowned and glanced at each other. After a while, [Shi Dehui] came back.
0:39:13|0:39:31|Three of them left. On that day, the wind was howling, and a militiaman climbed up the village wall at the entrance, holding a gun on guard duty.
0:39:34|0:39:52|Under the city wall, two militia members looked around vigilantly, then returned to the village and closed the gate. Inside the house, [Shi Dehui] studied earnestly by the dim light of a kerosene lamp.
0:40:9|0:40:28|[Shi Dehui] looked up and sensed something was wrong. The sound of the mirror woke up the villagers who were sleeping, and they quickly woke up those around them. [Liu Hulan] and her family also put on their clothes and got out of bed.
0:40:28|0:40:34|Outside the village, a group of people on horseback stopped. Lv Shanqing and a Japanese man were pointing in a direction.
0:40:38|0:40:50|The Japanese waved their hands, urging the horses to gallop forward. The alarm bells kept ringing as the villagers fled with their belongings and family members.
0:40:50|0:41:5|Shi Dehui, Guihuamei, and [Liu Hulan] directed the villagers to leave in an orderly manner. [Liu Hulan] picked up a fallen bundle and handed it to the villagers. Qingyunsao held her son's hand, stopped, and shouted for her husband in the crowd. The militia on the city wall saw the cavalry approaching the village gate quickly.
0:41:8|0:41:33|People are evacuating quickly. Qingyun's sister and her son were swept away by the crowd, with the son standing in place crying. Qingyun's sister wanted to come back, but was pushed further and further away from her son by the crowd. Militia members threw grenades at the horsemen from the city tower. On the other side, [Liu Hulan] heard the crying of the child and looked around.
0:41:36|0:41:39|Here, the soldiers in the camp, out of bullets, hurriedly descended from the city tower.
0:41:44|0:41:54|[Liu Hulan] found the little boy in the corner and picked him up, then ran away. By this time, the villagers had already evacuated, and Qingyun's wife rushed back and saw her own son.
0:41:54|0:42:10|The militiamen coming down from the city wall met them. After a few words, the militiamen carried Qingyun's wife and ran forward. [Liu Hulan] looked back and saw the cavalry rushing into the village, so she had to run in the opposite direction with the little boy. She found a cellar and hid inside with the little boy.
0:42:13|0:42:43|The Japanese are nearby, [Liu Hulan] ran a few steps deeper into the cellar. The little boy is still crying, so [Liu Hulan] had to cover the boy's mouth first. There was a hand grenade explosion outside the cellar entrance. When the Japanese soldiers moved away, [Liu Hulan] finally sat up with the little boy and wiped his tears away.
0:43:20|0:43:26|[Liu Hulan] looked outside, then hugged the little boy, dragging her feet slowly towards the cellar entrance.
0:43:48|0:44:6|[Liu Hulan] walked through the village holding a little boy, with fires still burning in some places. Looking at the desolate village, [Liu Hulan] was in disbelief, her eyes empty.
0:44:17|0:44:30|The villagers gathered around [Liu Hulan], and Qingyun took her son from her hands. [Liu Hulan] stood there in a daze, tears in her eyes.
0:44:38|0:44:44|[Liu Hulan] glanced around at the villagers beside her.
0:44:55|0:44:57|Everyone's gaze was very determined.
0:45:9|0:45:20|The sign of the Anti-Japanese Village Office in Yunzhou West Village has been burned. On this day, [Liu Hulan] and Shi Dehui hung it up again, and the villagers gathered around to watch.
0:45:37|0:45:45|One day, [Liu Hulan] sat by the stove burning fire, Grandfather sat smoking on the side, while Liu's Mom was busy on the kang with a bamboo whip in her hand.
0:46:22|0:46:26|The whole village was crying, and the children were crying even more.
0:46:33|0:46:52|[Liu Hulan] stood up, lifted the lid, and stirred the watery porridge in the pot with a ladle. Her mother was picking out millet from the winnowing tray.
0:47:2|0:47:21|Grandfather continued to smoke his pipe, while Liu's Mom and [Liu Hulan] were busy with their own tasks. Qingyun Auntie carried her child and Guifhua Sister into the house, [Liu Hulan] went to greet them and then sat with them by the kang.
0:47:48|0:47:52|Liu's Mom and Liu Hulan lowered their heads.
0:48:19|0:48:30|[Liu Hulan] and [Liu's Mom] poured all the millet from the winnowing pan into a bowl and handed it to Aunt Qingyun.
0:48:36|0:48:44|Qingyun looked at Grandfather, then at the child in her arms. Guifang glanced at the child, turned her head, her face filled with worry.
0:48:54|0:48:58|[Liu Hulan] straightened her clothes and walked outside. Guifang ran over.
0:49:33|0:49:57|Guifamei nodded, [Liu Hulan] left, Guifamei turned around with a smile. Inside the house, [Grandfather] smiled and said to [Liu's Mom]. Shi Xingwang left with a gun on his back.
0:50:32|0:50:40|[Liu Hulan] welled up with tears. At the group meeting, [Liu Hulan] spoke with tears in her eyes.
0:51:32|0:51:35|At the village entrance, [Liu's Father], [Liu Hulan], and others ran towards Comrade Sun.
0:52:39|0:52:43|Everyone clapped excitedly.
0:53:6|0:53:26|Comrade Sun led the team away, waving goodbye to the villagers, while the villagers were all working in the fields in the spring.
0:53:30|0:53:37|A person driving a cow and a donkey together leaves, waving to [Liu's Father] driving two donkeys on the opposite side.
0:53:55|0:54:8|[Liu Hulan] and Guifhua Meimei were pushing and pulling together, controlling the two baskets on the unicycle. Xiaoying's mother came over, and the two stopped. [Liu Hulan] took off the towel around her neck and wiped the sweat off.
0:54:51|0:55:12|The donkey kept lifting its hooves, dumping baskets of manure into the ground. [Liu Hulan] and Guifeng were busy carrying manure. Gradually, [Liu Hulan] started to feel a bit unsteady, swaying from side to side. She failed to support the unicycle for a moment, causing it to tilt to one side. She struggled to lift the unicycle back up and continued on.
0:55:12|0:55:17|Before long, [Liu Hulan] fainted, and Guifeng quickly ran over.
0:55:23|0:55:44|At home, [Liu Hulan] lay on the kang, looking haggard and unconscious. Her mother held her, and her younger sister Guifang also stayed by her side to take care of her. Later, [Grandfather] handed a bowl of water to her mother, while several women gathered around the kang.
0:55:50|0:56:2|Liu's Mom fed water to [Liu Hulan], who slowly regained some strength. A woman approached her and said.
0:56:26|0:56:32|Shi Dehui walked over with a dustpan, he glanced at [Liu Hulan], then looked at Guihuamei.
0:56:36|0:56:41|Guihua Mei took the winnowing basket, and [Liu Hulan] grabbed her.
0:57:12|0:57:15|[Liu Hulan] leaned back, and Guifeng looked at Shi Dehui.
0:57:28|0:57:33|[Liu Hulan] then lowered her eyes and bowed her head.
0:57:37|0:57:40|Guifang Mei left with a winnowing basket.
0:57:46|0:57:48|[Liu Hulan] smiled.
0:57:53|0:58:9|Not long after, the millet, sorghum, and rice were all growing vigorously. A person rode a horse from a distance, urging the horse on.
0:58:21|0:58:32|The person walked through the field path, arrived at the village entrance, stopped for a while, and then rode the horse in.
0:58:42|0:59:0|Shi Dehui, [Liu Hulan], Guihua and Xiaoqing's mother were all very excited. [Liu's Dad]'s parents brought [Grandfather] out, and Grandfather was overjoyed. The villagers and Wensheng all ran out from their homes, all very excited and happy. Everyone gathered around Xiaoqing.
0:59:16|0:59:34|Xiaoqing dismounted from the horse, everyone surrounded her with smiles on their faces. Guifang excitedly hugged [Liu Hulan].
0:59:59|1:0:29|In front of the house pillar hangs a sign of the Anti-Japanese Village Office of Xicun in Yunzhou, and under the eaves hangs a sign of the Democratic Village Office of Xicun in Yunzhou, both brand new. On this day, with the weather pleasant, [Liu Hulan] and Xiaoqing sat under a big tree, with the horse tied to the tree. Xiaoqing glanced at [Liu Hulan], wanting to speak but hesitating.
1:0:31|1:0:36|[Liu Hulan] lowered her head, glanced at Xiaoqing, and then smiled towards the distance.
1:0:47|1:0:52|The two looked around at the peaceful scenery.
1:1:54|1:1:59|[Liu Hulan] also stood up, took a few steps forward, and continued to smile as she looked into the distance.
1:2:18|1:2:29|Xiaoqing placed her hand on [Liu Hulan]'s shoulder. [Liu Hulan] looked at Xiaoqing and smiled even more brightly.
1:2:50|1:3:16|[Liu Hulan] stood still, watching the back of Xiaoqing. Xiaoqing went to untie the rope tied to the horse, rode the horse to [Liu Hulan]. Xiaoqing rode away. [Liu Hulan] watched him gradually go away, disappearing from sight.
1:3:36|1:3:43|In July 1946, instigated by the American imperialists, the Jiang bandits violently launched a new counter-revolutionary war against the people.
1:4:9|1:4:12|The bandits led by Yuan Yishan have reached Pingchuan.
1:4:27|1:4:44|The villagers brought their own grains and vegetables. [Liu Hulan] and her sister happily placed these items on the carriage. The two of them drove the carriage away from the village.
1:4:48|1:5:16|On the front line, a soldier carrying a wounded comrade with a right leg injury, Comrade Sun helped him to put the wounded down, then said to the soldier. Comrade Sun squatted down to check the leg injury of the wounded. [Liu Hulan] and Guifeng brought food over.
1:5:17|1:5:24|[Liu Hulan] threw the whip onto the carriage, walked up to Comrade Sun, and took off the towel around her neck to wipe off the sweat.
1:6:45|1:7:14|This is [Liu Hulan]. The two of them crouched down to examine Lao Zhao's leg injury. Comrade Sun looked into the distance again. The two of them helped Lao Zhao up. One on each side, they supported Lao Zhao as they left.
1:7:24|1:7:44|At night, [Liu Hulan] and Guifeng carefully looked around, then helped Old Zhao sit down. [Liu Hulan] laid Old Zhao's injured leg flat, rebandaged it, and carefully wiped around the wound with a towel.
1:8:2|1:8:6|[Liu Hulan] looked ahead and the two of them helped Old Zhao up.
1:8:11|1:8:34|Hearing the gunshots, they quickly crouched down again. A soldier from the Nationalist Party fired a shot and then walked over to several other soldiers who were roasting and eating chicken. [Liu Hulan] lay on the ground, peeking out from the bushes, and spotted the soldiers. [Liu Hulan] lowered her body to hide and slowly crawled back.
1:8:34|1:8:37|Several soldiers noticed something unusual and put down their food.
1:8:39|1:9:0|[Liu Hulan] has retreated to the side of Guihua and Lao Zhao. She tugged at Lao Zhao's clothes, and the three of them crawled back together. On the other side, a soldier waved his hand, and two soldiers followed. They ran a few steps with their guns, stopped to identify the direction, and then ran towards one side.
1:9:9|1:9:34|[Liu Hulan] and Guifhua helped Grandfather to run. Hearing the noise behind them, they quickly ran to the side to hide. Three soldiers caught up, didn't see anyone, and continued to search ahead.
1:9:44|1:9:58|Hearing the noise, the few immediately lowered their bodies, and a few soldiers walked past them from the position above their heads. The three of them watched the soldiers' movements vigilantly.
1:10:9|1:10:33|After confirming it was safe, [Liu Hulan] sat up straight, craned her neck and looked around. Not far away, there was a river. Guifeng looked a bit discouraged, and [Liu Hulan] turned to look at Grandfather. The two helped Grandfather up and walked towards the river. [Liu Hulan] glanced back and then walked to the riverbank.
1:10:39|1:11:6|[Liu Hulan] carried Lao Zhao on her back, with Guihua Mei supporting them on the side, they left by the river. Back in the village, [Liu Hulan] helped Lao Zhao rebandage his wounds.
1:11:15|1:11:25|Hearing the noise, Liu Hulan's grandfather was excited and tried to stand up. The two people held him down as Liu's Mom ran over.
1:11:32|1:11:54|Shi Xingwang left, [Liu Hulan] glanced at Guihua, thought for a moment, helped Lao Zhao bandage up, then supported him with Guihua as they left. As soon as they stepped out, they ran into [Grandfather]. With the enemy closing in, the three of them arrived at the ancient tomb outside the village.
1:11:57|1:12:21|[Liu Hulan] first peeked inside, then jumped down and carefully helped old Zhao hide inside. The noise outside grew louder and louder.
1:12:33|1:12:58|In the village, Lv Shanqing and a Kuomintang officer stood together, waving their hands to signal the soldiers to advance. With a nod from the officer, Lv Shanqing followed him. In the ancient tomb, upon hearing gunshots, [Liu Hulan] looked worried. [Liu Hulan] walked out, and someone outside the tomb called out to her, causing her to instinctively take a step back.
1:13:5|1:13:22|He and Guihua looked at each other, realizing that it was their own people who had crawled out. They helped Lao Zhao out, said Shiqingwang.
1:13:33|1:13:41|Liu Hulan carried Lao Zhao on his back, while Guihua Mei led the two of them away. Liu Hulan pulled Shi Xingwang over. Liu Hulan seemed lost in thought.
1:14:1|1:14:19|He grabbed the gun from Shi Xingwang, who gave him two grenades. [Liu Hulan] turned and walked away, with Shi Xingwang and another militia member following him. In the dark cave, Shi Dehui stood with his hands tied behind his back, while someone guarded the door.
1:14:25|1:14:49|Ten Star, Wang, and San approached cautiously. They kept a close eye on the guard at the entrance of the dark cave. Waiting for the right moment, Ten Star gave a signal to the militia.
1:14:52|1:15:9|The two knocked down the guard, and Shi Dehui quickly ran to the door to observe the situation. Shi Xingwang and the militiamen suffocated the guard, exchanged a glance, and the militiaman gestured for Shi Xingwang to go in, while he himself forcefully squeezed the man's neck a few more times.
1:15:9|1:15:16|Shi Xingwang entered the dark cave and helped [Liu's Father] untie the ropes first, then the two of them together untied the ropes for others.
1:15:23|1:15:44|Speed up, untie each other, and move outward. In the alley, [Liu Hulan], Shi Xingwang, and others protected Shi Dehui and retreated cautiously. They were on guard against two enemy sentries not far away. Several people hid in the shadows.
1:15:50|1:16:16|Shi Xingwang gestured to not act rashly, slowly peeking out from the wall to observe. Two enemies were walking back and forth in front of a large gate with guns on their shoulders. [Liu Hulan] and Shi Dehui also peeked out to watch, as Shi Xingwang turned back and whispered. Shi Dehui left with some people.
1:16:20|1:16:35|An enemy fired a shot, Shi Xingwang leaned out and shot the enemy in the chest, causing him to fall. A large group of enemies with guns rushed over, a few people prepared to retreat, [Liu Hulan] threw a grenade at them, and he and [Liu's Father] covered everyone in the end.
1:16:35|1:16:43|Shi Xingwang occasionally stopped to shoot at the enemies behind, but he was unexpectedly shot and fell down with serious injuries. [Liu Hulan] went to help him, but Shi Xingwang was already beyond help.
1:16:44|1:17:1|The enemy is catching up, [Liu Hulan] grabs Shi Xingwang's gun and runs. He jumps through a broken wall hole, bullets hitting the wall. [Liu Hulan] hides behind the wall hole and shoots, clumsily reloading. As the enemy fires a few shots, he quickly dodges, then stands up and fires a shot, tries to reload again, only to find there are no more bullets.
1:17:1|1:17:11|He threw away the gun, took out a grenade and threw it towards the enemy. At this moment, several enemies appeared behind him. As he turned around, he ran into them. The enemies raised their guns and approached, and [Liu Hulan] made a quick move.
1:17:19|1:17:37|The village was very quiet, and the strong wind lifted the soil from the ground. In the dark cave, [Liu Hulan] was tied to a pillar, with his hands bound above his head, his face showing determination.
1:17:44|1:17:59|At this moment, Lv Shanqing walked in with a bamboo tray, while the Nationalist officer stood at the door. Lv Shanqing glared at [Liu Hulan] with a fierce look, and [Liu Hulan] returned the glare.
1:18:3|1:18:9|[Liu Hulan] turned her head away from him, while Lv Shanqing had one hand on his hip.
1:18:29|1:18:42|[Liu Hulan] gave him another glare. [Liu Hulan] showed no fear at all. LÃ¼ Shanqing approached him.
1:18:48|1:18:56|He held up the bamboo platform in front of [Liu Hulan] and studied her expression.
1:19:4|1:19:13|[Liu Hulan] closed her eyes, then slowly opened them, a beam of light appeared in her eyes. It was dawn.
1:19:16|1:19:37|In the village square, the villagers gathered together, surrounded by a circle of Nationalist soldiers holding guns, their bayonets shining brightly in the sun. A Nationalist officer walked up to the platform with his hands in his pockets, followed by [Grandfather] who stood beside him.
1:19:45|1:20:4|The villagers either ignored them, showed disdainful expressions, or struggled to hide their sadness. [Liu's Father] and [Liu's Mom] stood among the crowd, with [Liu's Mom] choking back tears and [Liu's Father] helplessly bowing his head. Little Aunt and Qingyun's wife exchanged a glance, glaring at them with hatred, while [Grandfather] also stared at them.
1:20:12|1:20:29|In the dark cellar, a beam of light shines through the window. Two soldiers from the Nationalist Party walk in, one puts away his gun to untie the ropes on [Liu Hulan], while the other holds a gun pointed at [Liu Hulan].
1:20:29|1:20:38|The rope loosened, and [Liu Hulan] almost lost her balance. She immediately stood up straight, flicked her hair back, and the Nationalist soldiers tied her hands behind her back.
1:20:41|1:20:56|Outside, the Nationalist officer anxiously waited, frowning as he glanced at his watch. Two soldiers brought out [Liu Hulan], with a bayonet pointed at her back.
1:21:12|1:21:19|Throughout the journey, [Liu Hulan] looked at the appearance of the village, this was the place where she had lived since childhood, tears shimmered in her eyes.
1:21:34|1:21:55|Arriving at the open space, the villagers all turned to look at him, wanting to rush up. The soldiers of the Kuomintang pushed and beat the villagers, making way for a path. [Liu Hulan] was pushed forward by a soldier, and [Grandfather] took the opportunity to rush to [Liu Hulan]'s side from the crowd. A soldier pushed [Grandfather] to the ground.
1:21:57|1:22:22|A villager tried to help [Grandfather], but was pulled away by a soldier and thrown to the ground. Liu's Mom, Aunt, and [Liu's Dad] were all confronting the soldiers, with Mom crying out. [Liu Hulan] watched as everyone stood up against the Nationalist soldiers. A Nationalist officer fired two shots into the sky, and everyone finally stopped.
1:22:27|1:22:47|Nationalist army officer and Lv Shanqing walked down from the high platform and stood in the center of the open space.
1:22:47|1:23:6|Some people glared at him, [Liu's Mom] also looked at him with hatred, [Liu's Dad] lowered his head, Xiaoqing's mother turned her head away with tears in her eyes, [Grandfather] glanced at him sideways, some villagers were anxious and helpless, a Kuomintang officer walked up to [Liu Hulan] and touched his arm with a gun. [Liu Hulan] pushed the gun away with his arm.
1:23:6|1:23:22|[Liu Hulan] turned her head away from him, the officer suppressed his smile and exchanged a glance with Lv Shanqing. He then smiled and walked around to the other side of [Liu Hulan], who turned her head again.
1:23:27|1:23:33|[Liu Hulan] looked at everyone and took a few steps forward.
1:24:12|1:24:37|The officer walked over, and with a toss of his head, the soldier grabbed his shoulder. [Liu Hulan] shook off his hand, and not far away, the executioner's knife was lifted up. [Liu Hulan] suddenly turned his head, startling the officer. [Liu Hulan] stood up straight, resolutely walking towards the executioner's knife.
1:24:37|1:24:43|Under the leadership of Comrade Sun and Xiaoqing, Lv Shanqing, the military officer, and his soldiers were ultimately all eliminated.
