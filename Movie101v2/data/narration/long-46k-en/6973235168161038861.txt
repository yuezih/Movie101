0:4:56|0:5:17|[Ye Wenwen] pulled the door curtain to prepare to change out of her wedding dress, [Gu Xiaolei] and [Ling Xiao] also got up from their sleep. As a first officer, [Ling Xiao] skillfully tied his tie and quickly changed his shoes to go to work at the airport. [Gu Xiaolei] also changed into the airport security personnel uniform, she dressed neatly, quickly put on makeup, styled her hair, and rushed to her work position, starting a day of work.
0:5:18|0:5:32|After finishing a day of work, [Ling Xiao] made a phone call in the car, driving on the road in his own car. The camera followed [Ling Xiao]'s car, and as classical music played, director [Liu Jiang]'s name appeared on the screen.
0:5:36|0:5:54|In the following scene, a billboard appears with pictures of the four female leads in wedding dresses. The camera slowly pans up to the sky, revealing the title of the film, "Let's Get Married". As the music fades out, the movie transitions into the main storyline.
0:5:55|0:6:4|In the airport, [Ling Xiao] wearing sunglasses looks down at [Gu Xiaolei], while [Gu Xiaolei] carefully inspects the items in front of her.
0:6:14|0:6:24|[Gu Xiaolei] picked up a bottle of skincare product and said, "[Ling Xiao], taking off his sunglasses impatiently, questioned her:
0:6:31|0:6:43|[Gu Xiaolei] took out a box of condoms from her bag, and the crew members burst into laughter when they saw this scene.
0:6:53|0:7:3|[Gu Xiaolei] packed up the bag in front of her and pushed it towards [Ling Xiao]. [Ling Xiao] put on his sunglasses, gave her a smile, then turned and walked away. After [Gu Xiaolei] returned a fake smile to him, she continued working.
0:7:5|0:7:29|A plane flew over from the sky and landed in Rome, Italy. [Wen Yi] was dragging a suitcase and a violin out of the airport. Accidentally, she collided with someone next to her, who immediately bowed and apologized, "Sorry, sorry." [Wen Yi] ignored him and walked to the side with her suitcase.
0:7:38|0:7:52|Hello, [Wen Yi] glanced at the person, still ignoring them. She picked up her phone and saw a text message from [Wang Yunfei], which contained the phone number of Italian director [Li Xiang]. [Wen Yi] dialed director [Li Xiang]'s number.
0:7:55|0:8:2|Upon hearing the voice, [Wen Yi] turned around and saw the person who had just collided with her, little did she know it was [Li Xiang].
0:9:17|0:9:36|Pavarotti, with his head held high, sang the song of Pavarotti, one of the world's top three tenors. Following Pavarotti's singing, the scene showed the streets of Rome, Italy. [Wen Yi] excitedly took out her phone from the car to take photos. As the music ended, the camera returned to Beijing, China.
0:9:38|0:9:48|Li Feng, dressed in a suit and holding a bouquet of roses, stood still as [Ye Wenwen] looked at the person in front of her.
0:10:21|0:10:44|After saying what she wanted to say, [Ye Wenwen] walked away in her high heels without looking back, while [Li Xiang] stood still holding the flowers. After a while, he walked to the front desk and put down the flowers. The receptionist smiled at him slightly and watched him leave. Later, [Ye Wenwen] hid in a corner of the bridal shop and silently shed tears, then the scene switched to the restaurant.
0:12:28|0:12:32|[Wen Yi] sat slumped on the sofa behind, letting out a long sigh of resignation.
0:12:55|0:13:11|[Wen Yi] left an envelope and got on the bus to Batrila. The sunlight shone on her face through the car window. After a while, [Wen Yi] fell asleep on the bus. The scene then switched to the hospital, where Doctor Shao was holding a pregnancy test stick.
0:13:34|0:13:39|Tian Haixin snatched the pregnancy test stick and left, then called Cao Dapeng.
0:13:50|0:14:2|In the kitchen, [Cao Dapeng] hung up the phone, and in the next moment, a plane flew overhead. [Ling Xiao] finished his flight for the day, dressed in his pilot uniform, wearing sunglasses, driving home.
0:14:3|0:14:23|The soft light of the setting sun shines on [Ling Xiao]'s face through the window glass. When he arrives home, before entering the door, he sees a cardboard box outside. He puts down his suitcase and uses his hands to look through the contents of the box. Inside the box are several small teddy bear plush toys. He then turns around, inserts the key to open the door, but after a few twists, the door does not open.
0:14:23|0:14:28|After pulling out the key and pondering for a moment, he turned towards the room and said:
0:15:14|0:15:37|Gu Xiaolei didn't lock the door, turned around and entered the house. Ling Xiao was outside holding luggage, picked up the condom that Gu Xiaolei had just thrown out, and walked into the house. Cao Dapeng returned home after work, put a piece of meat in Tian Haixin's bowl, and Tian Haixin put down the empty yogurt box.
0:17:36|0:17:43|[Wen Yi] looked around and turned to ask, "Is this Matera?" The driver replied yes, this is Matera. [Wen Yi] asked again about Matera.
0:17:46|0:17:54|The driver replied to him, "Yes, this is Matera." He took out a piece of paper full of English words from his bag. The driver told him, "No, Matera is far from here. This is Matera."
0:17:57|0:18:10|I'm sorry the bus drove away, [Wen Yi] stood alone with her luggage on the streets of Matera at night. When she saw the local villagers, she quickly asked, "hello, how are you?" The local resident replied, "hello."
0:18:15|0:18:37|Unable to communicate due to the language barrier, she asked the locals at the hotel again. They said a lot of words, and at that moment, a dog in the distance started barking wildly at her. [Wen Yi] looked terrified, turned around to leave, but accidentally fell off the curb. The local residents quickly helped her up and said some words she couldn't understand. She walked to the side, took out her phone, opened the contacts, found Wang Yunfei's number, and dialed it.
0:18:40|0:18:50|The fall just now left her arm injured with large bloodstains, and she cried when she looked at her injured arm.
0:18:50|0:19:11|Later, she found the tour guide [Li Xiang]'s phone, hesitating whether to make the call. She clenched her fist slightly, but hesitated to make the call. At the same time, [Ye Wenwen] sat at the table, absentmindedly holding a pen in her hand, lost in thought. [Gu Xiaolei] sat on the bed, quietly watching [Ling Xiao] beside her.
0:19:19|0:19:45|It was late at night in Matruh, with no one around. [Wen Yi] was leaning against the wall on the side of the road when a car approached from a distance and stopped in front of her. [Li Xiang] and the aunt got out of the car, and [Wen Yi] started crying against the aunt. The night was still so quiet, with the cold moonlight shining through the window onto [Gu Xiaolei]'s face as she propped her head up, lost in thought.
0:19:46|0:19:54|The next morning, a chicken feather duster tickled [Ling Xiao]'s soles.
0:20:4|0:20:8|He opened his eyes in a daze and immediately jumped up when he saw the newcomer.
0:20:19|0:20:26|[Ling Xiao] rubbed his eyes.
0:21:14|0:21:19|Gu Xiaolei's mother saw Ling Xiao's half-exposed buttocks and shyly turned her head away.
0:24:6|0:24:22|[Gu Xiaolei] cried in a very aggrieved manner, bowing her head to wipe away tears. Upon seeing this, [Ling Xiao] hurriedly embraced her, gently patting her back. Meanwhile, [Ye Wenwen], who had arrived at the bridal shop early in the morning, walked in and saw a model in the lobby who hadn't put on her clothes properly.
0:24:37|0:24:43|[Ye Wenwen] quickly put down the bag in her hand and walked towards the store.
0:25:41|0:26:8|[Ye Wenwen] nodded at her, and Wang Kuer left the bridal shop with the flowers. [Ye Wenwen] nodded in agreement, then drove to Chen Zhenxuan's house. Upon arrival, she parked the car, got out with the damaged wedding dress in her arms, and ran towards Chen Zhenxuan's house. She walked in.
0:26:10|0:26:38|Calling out a few times without getting a response, she then walked up the stairs to the second floor area. Still not seeing Chen [Zhen Xuan], she continued down the corridor with the wedding dress in her arms. She arrived at a room with elegant decoration, where a turntable was playing a classical piece. [Ye Wenwen] placed the wedding dress on the table.
0:26:38|0:27:13|Carefully adjusting the hem of the wedding dress, she inadvertently turned her head and was startled by something behind her. She covered her mouth and looked at the panda plush toy in front of her. One tall and one short, they danced to the music. [Ye Wenwen] couldn't help but laugh. One of the panda plush toys accidentally fell when it turned around, causing the other one to fall as well. They took off the panda headgear, only to reveal Chen [Zhen Xuan] and his son Yiyi. The three of them looked at each other and burst into laughter.
0:27:13|0:27:18|On the other side, Tian Haixin is busy preparing for a wedding in the hotel.
0:27:52|0:27:59|[Ye Wenwen] squatted down to help Wang Ke'er straighten her skirt, and stood up to see [Li Xiang] playing with a bracelet.
0:28:28|0:28:53|Li Xiang and Wang Ke'er walked hand in hand into the wedding venue, while Chen Zhen Xuan on the sofa witnessed the whole process. Ye Wenwen held back her tears, slightly tilting her head up, controlling the tears, not wanting them to flow from her eyes. She then sat on the sofa and picked up a balloon to play with.
0:29:45|0:29:53|The balloon being played with suddenly exploded.
0:32:55|0:33:30|Chen [Zhen Xuan] carried the drunken Ye Wenwen through the crowd fighting for the flower ball and walked outside. Wang Ke'er was preparing to throw the flower ball backwards with her back to the crowd, but her exaggerated movement caused the wedding dress to tear again. She quickly grabbed the torn part with her hand. The thrown flower ball happened to fall into Ye Wenwen's arms. The bridesmaid went on stage to help Wang Ke'er cover her back. Li Xiang saw this and immediately took off his suit, strode onto the stage, and draped the suit over Wang Ke'er's shoulders. He supported his bride as they walked off the stage.
0:33:30|0:33:47|On stage, chaos ensued, followed by a sudden commotion in the audience below. Glasses were knocked over as people scrambled for the bouquet, dispersing in all directions. Chen [Zhen Xuan] smiled as he watched [Ye Wenwen] leave the wedding scene in his arms.
0:33:49|0:33:59|The next day, [Ye Wenwen] woke up from her dream, she slowly got up, holding her head.
0:34:1|0:34:15|Ye Wenwen lifted the blanket, got out of bed, and walked to the table. She saw a painting on the table depicting a family of three, but the mother's face was missing. Ye Wenwen stared at it absentmindedly.
0:34:18|0:34:33|[Zhen Xuan] is downstairs performing actions with his hands, he gives a thumbs up to Ye Wenwen, who is looking at the father and son downstairs through the window.
0:34:59|0:35:4|[Ye Wenwen] nodded and smiled, while [Zhen Xuan] lowered his head and said to Yi Yi:
0:38:22|0:38:31|[Tian Haixin] fastened her seatbelt, started the car, and drove away. The next day, [Cao Dapeng] went to the hospital.
0:39:16|0:39:29|Doctor Shao took out the medicine from the medicine cabinet to hand it to Cao Dapeng, who had already left and was squatting on the roadside waiting for Tian Haixin. He stood up when he saw her getting out of the car, carrying a bag as she got out of the car.
0:40:35|0:40:56|The crowd in front of the hotel disperses, and [Cao Dapeng] shakes his head helplessly, then angrily heads to the kitchen to start working. He walks towards the roast duck rack wearing white gloves.
0:41:11|0:41:25|The disciple is blowing air into a duck with great effort. As the music plays, the scene shifts to Italy, where the weather is clear and sunny. [Li Xiang] is driving through dusty country roads, heading towards Rome on the asphalt road.
0:41:25|0:41:42|The car drove for a long time, dusk gradually fell, and they finally returned to Rome again, staying at the hotel they had stayed in before. [Wen Yi] looked somewhat melancholy, slowly playing the violin against her neck, while [Li Xiang] watched her from the side.
0:41:42|0:41:59|The aunt sat on the balcony chair, holding a bottle of skincare product and squeezing a small drop onto her fingertips to massage and rub. The three of them sat there, lost in their own thoughts.
0:42:25|0:42:34|After listening to Li Xiang's words, Wen Yi contemplated silently for a long time, and decided to participate in the music competition. After the performance, the judges began to give their comments.
0:42:58|0:43:6|The host finished reading the list, and there was thunderous applause from the audience.
0:44:2|0:44:7|[Li Xiang] took the violin case from [Wen Yi] and handed the violin to [Wen Yi].
0:44:16|0:44:28|[文艺] hesitated, while [Li Xiang] held the violin against his neck, smiled at [文艺], and started playing with the bow on the strings. [文艺] looked at the person in front of her in astonishment, unable to believe that [Li Xiang] could play the violin.
0:44:30|0:44:41|The people on the street gathered around them after hearing the music, cheering and clapping their hands rhythmically, happily swaying their bodies to the beat led by [Li Xiang].
0:44:43|0:44:55|The aunt invited [Wen Yi] to dance. [Wen Yi] had already let loose and started dancing to the music, quickly blending in with the local residents. She happily held hands with them and danced along.
0:44:55|0:45:8|Li Xiang saw this scene, handed the violin to her, Wen Yi did not refuse, took the violin from Li Xiang's hand and started playing it from her neck, Li Xiang raised his hands high to encourage the people around to move.
0:45:24|0:45:39|[Wen Yi] immersed in it, passionately playing the violin in her hands. As the music ended, the scene returned to the country. [Ling Xiao] stood in front of a display case in the mall, looking at the rings in the case. After thinking for a long time, he returned to work at the airport.
0:45:40|0:45:49|On the second floor of the airport, he looked down and happened to see Gu Xiaolei's father. He followed Gu Xiaolei's father's footsteps and saw Gu Xiaolei's group.
0:46:13|0:46:22|Gu Xiaolei smiled as her parents and others left, then turned around to see [Ling Xiao] standing behind her. He had a cold expression on his face, hands in his pockets, looking at Gu Xiaolei. Gu Xiaolei stopped smiling and looked at him.
0:46:43|0:47:16|Tian Haixin turned to look out the window, Cao Dapeng reluctantly picked up a pen and signed his name on the divorce agreement. With the sound of the car door that Tian Haixin was paying close attention to, Cao Dapeng's heart also clenched. He regretfully tapped the steering wheel, drove back home to pack his luggage. He picked up the photo of him and Tian Haixin on the table, sighed softly, turned around, and started packing up his trophies.
0:47:34|0:47:46|The scene cuts to Gu Xiaolei's home, with [Ling Xiao] dragging his luggage past Gu Xiaolei.
0:48:9|0:48:23|Gu Xiaolei, with tears in her eyes, finished saying what she wanted to say. [Ling Xiao] remained silent, nodded, and left Gu Xiaolei's home with a suitcase. As the door closed, [Tian Haixin] returned home.
0:48:49|0:49:17|[Cao Dapeng] nodded towards the direction of the bedroom, indicating for [Tian Haixin] to go back to sleep. It was indeed an unusual day, the night was so long. [Ling Xiao] dragged the suitcase on the overpass, watching the cars passing by underneath. Alone at home, [Gu Xiaolei] curled up on the floor of the living room, holding a teddy bear and sobbing. In her sleep, [Cao Dapeng] turned around to hug [Tian Haixin], only to be pushed away by her.
0:49:17|0:49:30|[Cao Dapeng] turned around, facing away from [Tian Haixin], slowly opened his eyes. The two people lying on the same bed were back to back, eyes open, lost in their own thoughts.
0:49:30|0:49:50|[Ye Wenwen] sat on the bed with a laptop in her arms. She searched a blind date website on the laptop, then she did the marriage and love personality matching questionnaire on the website. Based on the answers, the website generated an ideal man portrait, which was almost identical to [Zhen Xuan]'s image in every aspect.
0:49:50|0:50:4|At this moment, [Zhen Xuan] is wearing glasses, burying his head in drawing costume sketches. The table is scattered with fabrics and his unfinished sketches, the long night finally over as dawn breaks.
0:50:4|0:50:38|Last night, leaning against [Tian Haixin] and [Cao Dapeng], they eventually ended up embracing each other. The morning sun shone on them, and [Tian Haixin] opened his eyes to see himself holding [Cao Dapeng]. He quickly pushed him away, and both looked around. They saw the word "喜" (happiness) posted all over the living room. They got up and walked towards the bedroom, pushed open the door, and found [Cao Dapeng] blowing up a balloon.
0:54:1|0:54:27|They passed through the city, drove along the country roads, [Wen Yi] raised his hands up, letting the wind pass through his fingers. After driving for a long time, [Li Xiang] took [Wen Yi] and the aunt to a church.
0:54:55|0:55:14|[Li Xiang] led [Wen Yi] to a door and pulled the curtain behind it. [Wen Yi] couldn't see the situation outside, stood behind, clasped her hands tightly, bowed her head, and silently prayed. Outside the door, the priest said, "You can start praying now."
0:56:20|0:56:26|[Wen Yi] left, and [Li Xiang], pretending to be a priest outside the door, didn't move for a long time after listening to what [Wen Yi] said.
0:56:39|0:57:1|Realizing that Auntie and [Wen Yi] had already left, [Li Xiang] opened the curtain beside him, stuck his head out and looked towards the church entrance. Seeing the two of them walking away, he turned around to face the statue in the church, made the sign of the cross on his forehead, chest, and shoulders with his right hand. Then he turned around, closed the church door, and left the place.
0:58:24|0:58:32|Zhen Xuan finished speaking and his phone in his pocket rang, so he walked to the side to answer the call.
0:58:38|0:58:49|[Ye Wenwen] smiled as she watched Zhen Xuan walking away. She then turned around and asked the salesgirls next to her.
0:58:52|0:59:8|The scene cuts to the party of Class 2 of the second grade, where Ye Wenwen, dressed in a panda costume, lifts the curtain on stage and sees that Zhen Xuan is not in the audience. Feeling wronged, she starts to cry. Meanwhile, Zhen Xuan is still at home adjusting a bridal veil.
0:59:24|0:59:43|Ye Wenwen pouted and walked towards the stage, while Chen [Zhen Xuan] was still adjusting the bridal veil. The performance for the second grade class party had already begun, with Ye Wenwen dressed in a giant panda costume chasing the children playing the big bad wolf on stage, and Chen [Zhen Xuan]'s bridal veil had just been fixed.
0:59:47|0:59:57|Chen [Zhen Xuan] looked at his watch while holding his coat, then hurried to the party. The children's performance had already ended, and Yi Yi stood on the stage with a dejected face.
1:0:10|1:0:17|Ye Wenwen sat alone in the audience seat below the stage, occasionally looking towards the door, but still did not see her father.
1:0:24|1:0:37|Ye Wenwen was absent-mindedly watching the performance on stage, staring fixedly at the entrance. Chen [Zhen Xuan] was still on the road driving, unfortunately running into a traffic jam, causing the spacious road to become congested for a while.
1:0:47|1:1:11|Ye Wenwen stood up from her seat, then burst into tears below the stage. She didn't respond, tears falling one by one. At this moment, a person ran in from the door. Ye Wenwen turned to the sound and stopped crying, looking shocked at the person walking in.
1:1:13|1:1:28|Chen [Zhen Xuan] increased the speed of the car, quickly drove to Yi Yi's school, swiftly parked the car and rushed into the teaching building. The slippers he didn't have time to change affected his pace. Finally, he arrived at the scene of the party and walked in, where he saw [Ye Wenwen] performing on stage.
1:1:40|1:2:6|[Ye Wenwen] gestured on stage, answering one question after another correctly. [Zhen Xuan] leaned against the wall by the classroom door, watching [Ye Wenwen] imitating animal performances on stage with lively movements. He fell into contemplation, thinking of the anxious look on [Ye Wenwen]'s face as she rushed into the classroom. While appearing calm on the surface, his heart was already in turmoil as he watched the two people laughing on stage.
1:2:6|1:2:30|His heart was as sweet as if he had drunk honey, finally unable to suppress the joy in his heart. He looked at the two people on the stage, with smiles at the corners of his eyebrows and mouth. The party ended, Chen [Zhen Xuan] and [Ye Wenwen] walked on the street.
1:2:51|1:3:13|After saying that, [Ye Wenwen] stepped forward and hugged [Zhen Xuan] by the neck. [Zhen Xuan] took a sharp breath, clearly uncomfortable with this sudden embrace. His hands hung in the air, body stiff, as [Ye Wenwen] let go and walked away.
1:3:25|1:3:48|After turning around and walking away, the smile on [Ye Wenwen]'s face gradually disappeared. Suddenly, a voice behind her called out to her. She turned around to see that it was [Li Xiang] who called her. [Zhen Xuan] bumped into the wall as he left, quickly hiding behind it and eavesdropping on the conversation between the two.
1:5:31|1:5:37|[Ye Wenwen] struggled hard to break free from [Li Xiang]'s embrace, she didn't want to stay a moment longer and quickly fled the scene.
1:5:38|1:5:44|Li Xiang watched as Ye Wenwen walked away, standing in place and crying. Zhen Xuan leaned against the wall, lost in his thoughts.
1:5:45|1:5:59|Back home, [Ye Wenwen] tossed and turned in bed, unable to fall asleep. Chen [Zhen Xuan] returned home and watched Yi Yi fall asleep. He took a half-drunk glass of milk from his hand and drank from it himself.
1:5:59|1:6:8|After finishing the remaining half bottle of milk, he glanced at the sleeping Wenwen, turned off the bedside lamp, and entered his own room.
1:6:9|1:6:44|He flipped through his costume manuscript and found a family photo inside, which was a picture of Chen [Zhen Xuan] and his mother when Chen was a child. He took out the photo from the book and smiled at the crying Chen in the photo. Then he put the photo back in its original place. On a quiet night with a gentle breeze, [Wen Yi] was in a hotel wearing a bathrobe when her phone suddenly vibrated. She stopped and used a towel to dry her hair.
1:6:44|1:6:54|Picking up her phone, Ye Wenwen looked at the text message sent by Zhen Xuan. She dropped the towel, the message read, "Tell me your return flight number, I will pick you up."
1:6:56|1:7:8|[Wen Yi] stood still without replying to his message. After putting down her phone and thinking quietly for a long time, she dressed up and walked on a bridge in Italy with [Li Xiang].
1:7:38|1:7:51|After they finished speaking, Li Xiang and Wen Yi leaned their arms on the pillar by the road. Li Xiang turned his head and looked affectionately at Wen Yi. Sensing his gaze, Wen Yi awkwardly touched her hair.
1:8:0|1:8:8|Upon hearing this, [Wen Yi] blushed shyly, turned around, and leaned against a pillar to avoid his gaze.
1:8:46|1:8:51|Before finishing his sentence, [Li Xiang] wrapped [Wen Yi] in his arms.
1:8:53|1:9:1|He looked at [Wen Yi]'s smooth and jade-like face, her cherry-red lips, and couldn't help but feel the urge to kiss her.
1:9:1|1:9:15|He leaned forward, slowly approaching [Wen Yi]. Just before making contact, [Wen Yi] lowered her head and pushed away [Li Xiang]'s arm. She turned around to look at the distant night view, and after a moment of contemplation, she softly said:
1:9:40|1:9:50|She turned around to face [Li Xiang], her eyes filled with tears of guilt.
1:9:52|1:10:21|[Li Xiang] turned his head with red eyes, unwilling to look at her. [Wen Yi] bent down and hugged [Li Xiang] for a moment before slowly letting go. [Li Xiang] hugged [Wen Yi] tightly, not wanting her to leave. [Wen Yi] cried on [Li Xiang]'s shoulder. [Li Xiang] released his hands, lifted his left hand to gently stroke [Wen Yi]'s face. He shook his head as he looked at [Wen Yi], hoping she wouldn't refuse. He leaned forward again, yearning for [Wen Yi]'s love.
1:10:21|1:10:43|[Wen Yi] still pushed, [Li Xiang] hugged [Wen Yi] tightly who was trying to leave again, no matter how [Wen Yi] tried to push him away this time, he held on tightly, unwilling to let go. He wanted to use brute force to steady [Wen Yi]'s lips. [Wen Yi] exerted all her strength and finally broke free from his embrace, crying as she turned and walked away.
1:10:56|1:11:9|[Li Xiang] stood still, watching as [Wen Yi] gradually moved away. The night lake was like a huge mirror, reflecting the lights on the surrounding buildings, creating a slight ripple.
1:11:9|1:11:44|The next day, during the day, [Ling Xiao]'s flight departed, flying from Beijing to Italy. He sat in the co-pilot's seat and skillfully parked the plane. The captain walked out of the cockpit, and after adjusting his seat, [Ling Xiao] didn't move. He thought for a long time, took out his phone, with a background of him and [Gu Xiaolei] in a photo. He opened the messaging app on his phone and sent a message to [Gu Xiaolei], saying he had arrived safely.
1:11:47|1:11:54|After finishing typing, he hesitated to press the send button, sighed, then lowered his head to delete the words he had just typed.
1:11:54|1:12:8|At this moment, [Gu Xiaolei] is sitting in front of the computer, looking at the information sent by the airline. The airline is inquiring whether [Gu Xiaolei] needs the ticket to Xiamen to be issued, and [Gu Xiaolei] answers yes.
1:12:17|1:12:24|[Ling Xiao] walked out of the Italian airport after landing, while [Li Xiang] was outside the airport carrying luggage.
1:12:51|1:12:58|Auntie turned around and left, leaving [Wen Yi] and [Li Xiang].
1:13:2|1:13:40|[Li Xiang] turned and walked to the car, opened the door, gave [Wen Yi] a smile, then got into the car, closed the door, started the car and drove away. At the airport entrance, [Wen Yi] looked through the thick glass window at [Li Xiang] inside, waiting until his car disappeared at the end of the road. People were coming and going at the airport entrance, she stood there quietly, looking in the direction the car had left.
1:13:45|1:13:52|In the night of Beijing, [Tian Haixin] and [Cao Dapeng] are lying on the floor of the living room.
1:14:56|1:15:25|The scene shifts, [Wen Yi] has also returned to China. She is pushing a suitcase at the airport, and Yun Fei sees her from a distance, waving to her. Through the crowd, she walks up to Wang Yunfei, who smiles and gives her a hug. [Gu Xiaolei] sits at home waiting for [Ling Xiao]'s response. [Ling Xiao] witnesses a wedding in Italy, where the groom holds the bride's hand and says, "Thank you all for attending our wedding."
1:17:29|1:17:36|Zhen Xuan put down the pen for the sketch, flexed his fingers, and then turned around to leave.
1:17:36|1:18:9|[Ye Wenwen] got up from the sofa and walked to the table, picking up the sketch that Chen Zhenxuan had just drawn. The sketch on the edge of the table fell down, revealing a family photo. [Ye Wenwen] squatted down to pick up the photo, looked at it for a while, then stood up and placed the sketch on the table. She gazed at the photo again, sighed softly, and then opened the sketch, preparing to put the photo inside.
1:18:9|1:18:18|The manuscript depicts a portrait of oneself, with the words written beside it: "The most beautiful moment in my life is meeting you."
1:18:20|1:18:46|She flipped back again, still her own portrait, with the words: October 18, 2012, clear skies, a smile from you disperses the dark clouds. She quickly flipped forward to the first page of the manuscript, where her bust, hips, and waist measurements were recorded. Flipping through, she saw various wedding dresses designed by Chen [Zhen Xuan] based on herself, flipping and flipping.
1:18:46|1:19:15|She flipped to the page where she first drew her self-portrait. It said: "August 2, 2018, a cloudy day. The best moment in my life is meeting you." Then she turned to the next page where another sentence was written beside the drawing: "December 24, 2012, light snow. At this moment, I returned to the greenness of first love."
1:19:16|1:19:42|Facing you, I hesitate and hesitate, the next page, in the 2013 portrait, it is written that I am willing to wipe away your tears forever, even if they have nothing to do with me, on the next page it says: in my world, your existence, regardless of whether the ending is perfect, I am satisfied.
1:19:43|1:20:15|Turning to the next page, the date is now 2014. No matter where you are, no matter how busy you are, I will be here waiting. On the next page, it says that everything in front of you is already the best arrangement. [Ye Wenwen] looked at the contents of the manuscript and tears fell from her eyes. She continued flipping through the manuscript until she saw a picture of herself in a pure white wedding dress, with the words "Let's get married" written next to it.
1:20:15|1:20:38|[Ye Wenwen] is so moved at this moment that she doesn't care about wiping away the tears streaming down her face. Her eyes are fixed on the few words next to the portrait, holding the heavy manuscript and sitting in the chair, unable to stop sobbing. The 5 characters on the painting are so prominent, and the white wedding dress manuscript on the yellowed paper is also striking.
1:20:38|1:21:1|[Ye Wenwen] kept looking at the picture album, not even aware when [Zhen Xuan] returned. [Zhen Xuan] and Yi Yi stood in the corridor, watching [Ye Wenwen] holding the manuscript and shedding tears. [Ye Wenwen] sensed the person behind her, but didn't turn around to face [Zhen Xuan].
1:21:1|1:21:28|She just slightly tilted her head, then closed the manuscript and placed it on the table in front of her. She got up from the chair, turned around and walked towards Chen [Zhen Xuan] and Yi Yi. Chen [Zhen Xuan] didn't look at Ye Wenwen, nor did he stop her. He let Ye Wenwen pass by him, looking at the catalog not far away, lost in thought. Ye Wenwen left.
1:21:28|1:21:54|Ye Wenwen looked up, Chen [Zhen Xuan] covered Ye Ye's mouth to signal her not to continue. Ye Wenwen returned home, sat on the floor in the living room, supporting her head with her hand and looking at the computer on the table. The computer displayed the image of the male god from the last marriage and love personality matching questionnaire. The next day,
1:22:43|1:22:54|After saying that, [Ye Wenwen] picked up her bag and walked towards the coffee shop with a smile on her face and a light step. She finally walked out of that humble love affair.
1:22:54|1:23:6|Li Feng sat with his head down, motionless in the chair, while [Ye Wenwen] walked out of the cafe, took out her phone from her bag, and dialed Chen [Zhen Xuan]'s number.
1:24:10|1:24:30|With the music playing, the camera moves to a church in Italy, the exterior of the church is very magnificent, the interior walls are decorated with murals. At this moment, an orchestra is performing, with [Li Xiang] dressed in a tailcoat, conducting with a baton.
1:24:37|1:24:55|Unfazed by the grand scene, [Li Xiang] stood at the conductor's podium and turned around as the music ended. The people around all stood up and applauded the orchestra's wonderful performance, and he bowed deeply towards the audience.
1:25:8|1:25:29|And hoping that he would stay and join the best orchestra in Italy, [Li Xiang] said he would seriously consider it. As he looked up, he saw [Wen Yi], quickly turned to his teacher and said he needed to leave for a moment. Then he followed [Wen Yi] with quick steps, afraid of losing her. He ran through the long corridor, finally catching up with [Wen Yi].
1:25:29|1:25:51|He quickly grabbed her shoulder, but the person who turned around was not [Wen Yi], just someone who looked very much like [Wen Yi]. He quickly apologized, saying he mistook the person, then stood in place with a disappointed look on his face. Meanwhile, in Beijing, [Wen Yi] was trying on wedding dresses in a bridal shop.
1:25:56|1:26:17|[Ye Wenwen] bent down to help [Wen Yi] adjust her skirt. As [Wen Yi] looked down at her skirt, she saw a reflection of someone in the mirror. The person who appeared was not Wang Yunfei, but [Li Xiang].
1:26:19|1:26:50|She looked at [Li Xiang] in the mirror, but when she turned her head, [Li Xiang] turned into Wang Yunfei. She put away her smile, turned to look at herself in the mirror, and Wang Yunfei walked to Wen Yi's side to look at her. Wen Yi smiled slightly at him, and the two leaned on each other in front of the mirror. As night fell on the bustling streets of Beijing, Tian Haixin returned home from work, turned on the lights in the living room, and then turned on the lights in the corridor.
1:26:50|1:27:14|She turned around and saw the wedding photo of herself and Cao Dapeng on the wall. Walking over, she looked closely at it, her eyes couldn't help but be wet with tears. She walked to the door and opened it, only to find that the person who came was Zhen Xuan.
1:28:20|1:28:26|[Tian Haixin] closed the door and hid behind it, crying.
1:29:8|1:29:26|[Tian Haixin] stood by the door, covering her mouth and crying non-stop. [Ye Wenwen] drove to Zhen Xuan's house, she pressed the doorbell a few times but no one answered. Then she called Zhen Xuan, but still no one picked up.
1:29:29|1:29:42|She bent down unwillingly and looked at Chen Zhenxuan's house, unable to understand why he didn't answer her calls. The next day, Ling Xiao returned to the country, and the captain looked at the screen.
1:30:50|1:31:21|The cabin was being tossed around by strong air currents, the aircraft was shaking wildly, and the cabin was in chaos. All the passengers were in a panic, including Li Xiang, who was preparing to return to his home country. Ling Xiao and the captain were exerting all their strength to control the aircraft's control buttons. The plane continued to shake uncontrollably, tilting upwards. Finally breaking through the thick clouds, Ling Xiao breathed a sigh of relief, and the captain calmed down.
1:31:21|1:31:32|The screams in the cabin gradually subsided, and the plane flew steadily in the air. The captain's face was covered with beads of sweat, obviously the previous situation had scared him as well.
1:31:33|1:31:35|Ling Xiao quickly executes the command.
1:31:42|1:31:52|Control center, this is Flight 556, with cheers and applause from the cabin outside the cockpit. [Li Xiang] is slumped in his seat, gasping for air, while the captain and [Ling Xiao] inside the cockpit fist-bump each other.
1:31:59|1:32:9|Li Xiang in the cabin took out a photo of him and Wen Yi from his pocket and looked at it.
1:32:46|1:32:59|The captain finished speaking, crossed his arms in front of his chest, turned to look out the window. [Ling Xiao] lowered his head in thought for a moment, then also looked out the window, lost in his own thoughts.
1:33:1|1:33:10|The camera shifted from an aerial scene to outside the bridal shop of [Ye Wenwen]. At this moment, the city radio station was playing the program of the day.
1:33:42|1:33:52|[Ye Wenwen] sat in the shop, still unable to get through to Zhen Xuan on the phone. [Wang Yunfei] greeted the people who came to attend his own wedding, dressed in a dark suit.
1:34:6|1:34:39|[Wen Yi] answered casually, head down and gloomy, letting [Ye Wenwen] play with the veil on her head. Suddenly, she lifted her head and listened carefully as she heard the familiar tune outside. She lifted the hem of her wedding dress and ran outside, pushing open the door of the dressing room and hurried to the wedding venue. When she emerged, tears streamed down her face. In the venue, she searched for the control panel playing the music, sliding her hands around haphazardly, trying to turn off the music.
1:34:52|1:35:6|The music continued, but obviously it was not the one [Wen Yi] had heard. [Wang Yunfei] took [Wen Yi] back to the dressing room, where [Wen Yi] couldn't stop crying.
1:36:23|1:36:27|[Ling Xiao] finished talking to his colleague, walked out of the corner, took out his phone and made a call.
1:36:36|1:37:9|The phone was not answered. When [Ling Xiao] got off work, it was already evening. He drove back home, opened the porch light, then the bedroom light. The bed was neatly made. He walked out of the bedroom, turned on the kitchen light, then the living room light. He saw a letter on the doll on the sofa, and upon reading it, he found out that [Gu Xiaolei] had resigned and left Beijing.
1:38:0|1:38:26|[Gu Xiaolei] has packed her luggage and gone to the airport. She looks back at the place where she used to work, while [Ling Xiao] rushes to the airport in his car. He quickly parks the car and rushes out of it. At the same time, [Gu Xiaolei] is looking at a billboard in the waiting area. Chen Zhenxuan tidies up his manuscript at home, [Ye Wenwen] walks towards the bridal shop, and [Tian Haixin] sits on the sofa at home.
1:38:26|1:38:54|[Cao Dapeng] was staring blankly in the kitchen, while [Wen Yi] was sobbing at home. [Li Xiang] stayed in the hotel, [Ling Xiao] rushed into the airport, he ran through the sensor door and stopped the airport patrol car by running down the stairs. He searched for [Gu Xiaolei] in various waiting rooms at the airport, almost searching the entire airport, but still did not see [Gu Xiaolei].
1:38:55|1:39:8|He anxiously bit his lip and scanned the waiting room, then he began searching around the airport. He quickly assessed the passengers boarding the plane, but still did not see the figure he was looking for.
1:39:8|1:39:35|He looked towards the corner of the waiting room where only a few passengers were standing. Then he turned to look elsewhere. After a few passengers got up and left, [Gu Xiaolei] sat in the spot they had blocked. [Ling Xiao] didn't see the blocked [Gu Xiaolei] and was still searching aimlessly at the airport. [Tian Haixin] was at home holding a phone, editing a message that read:
1:39:45|1:40:5|I now want to be a good mother more than a good employee, thank you again. After editing the content of the message, she did not send it immediately. She looked up, not knowing what she was thinking. After hesitating for a moment, she finally clicked send. She took a deep breath, not knowing if the decision she made was right.
1:40:6|1:40:12|And at this moment, the phone suddenly rang, showing an incoming call from General Wu.
1:40:23|1:40:45|[Gu Xiaolei] sat on the waiting seat at the airport, looking at a photo of herself and [Ling Xiao]. The airport announcement reminded passengers that the flight to Xiamen was about to depart. [Gu Xiaolei] took off her earphones, picked up her carry-on luggage, and slowly walked towards the boarding gate. Her pace was slow, as if she was anticipating something.
1:40:46|1:40:58|She lowered her head, holding the plane ticket in her hand. She handed the ticket to the staff, who carefully checked the information before turning around to hand it back to her. She turned around and looked back, tears in her eyes.
1:40:59|1:41:8|She entered the boarding gate, and the staff pulled up the isolation belt. [Ye Wenwen] walked in the store while talking on the phone.
1:41:55|1:42:20|Watching the two walk away, [Ye Wenwen] walked to the front desk, turned off the computer, then turned off all the lights in the store, ready to go home after work. But seeing a faint light coming from the changing room, she walked towards it, pulled back the curtain.
1:42:24|1:42:34|Inside is a very gorgeous wedding dress, with a small card on it that reads "[Ye Wenwen] custom-made".
1:42:36|1:42:46|She walked in, picked up the card, and looked up at the wedding dress. [Gu Xiaolei] had already boarded the plane.
1:43:11|1:43:29|She looked up at [Ling Xiao] in front of her, seeing her standing there in a daze, walked to her seat, knelt down on one knee, and took the hand holding the magazine into her own hands.
1:44:59|1:45:26|[Gu Xiaolei] nodded vigorously with tears streaming down her face, and [Ling Xiao] stood up to embrace her. The passengers in the cabin surrounded them, applauding warmly. [Ling Xiao] took out a ring and put it on [Gu Xiaolei]'s finger. Meanwhile, at the bridal shop, [Ye Wenwen] was...
1:45:27|1:45:51|Happily putting on the custom-made wedding dress, she lifted the hem of the skirt joyfully, spinning in place. Suddenly, the music from the projector in the shop started playing.
1:45:51|1:46:8|She hurriedly looked around, then turned to see Chen [Zhen Xuan] again. Chen [Zhen Xuan] was dressed in a formal suit, holding Yi Yi's hand. Yi Yi smiled at [Ye Wenwen], while his other hand was hidden behind his back, holding something unknown.
1:46:8|1:46:38|Chen [Zhen Xuan] pulled Yi Yi slowly towards Ye Wenwen, his eyes fixed only on her. At this moment, Ye Wenwen's heart was racing as she stood on the stage, watching the father and son approaching her. When Chen [Zhen Xuan] stepped onto the stage, he almost tripped and fell, causing Ye Wenwen to cover her mouth and laugh. Chen [Zhen Xuan] also awkwardly smiled, then solemnly said to Ye Wenwen:
1:47:48|1:48:13|The lights in the store suddenly came on, and a group of people walked out from behind [Ye Wenwen]. They were all colleagues who had been with [Ye Wenwen] day and night. Colleague Xiao Zhou blew her a kiss, and [Ye Wenwen] smiled back at him. She playfully lifted her foot and kicked Chen [Zhen Xuan] in the knee from behind. Chen [Zhen Xuan] knelt down on one knee and took out a ring that he had prepared long ago from his pocket.
1:48:36|1:48:50|Ye Wenwen's tears flowed out of her eyes one by one as she looked at Chen Zhenxuan in front of her. Xiao Zhou stood beside her, mouthing the words "agreed, agreed" to her. Finally, she got Ye Wenwen's reply.
1:48:50|1:49:9|Chen [Zhen Xuan] smiled happily, he stood up and put a ring on Ye Wenwen's finger. He lowered his head and gently kissed Ye Wenwen's hand with the ring on it. Yi Yi took out something hidden behind her back, it was a family portrait that was finally filled with three people.
1:49:10|1:49:39|[Ye Wenwen] squatted down and hugged Yi Yi's head. The people around them cheered for them. Chen [Zhen Xuan] reached out his hands to hold Yi Yi and [Ye Wenwen]. The people in the store were moved to tears by this proposal, applauding for their hard-won love. [Ye Wenwen] leaned happily in Chen [Zhen Xuan]'s arms, while at this moment [Tian Haixin] had already arrived at the hotel where she worked. She and General Wu took the elevator upstairs.
1:49:44|1:49:56|Seeing that Mr. Wu was not speaking, [Tian Haixin] could only follow him towards the banquet hall. As they approached, [Tian Haixin] stopped in his tracks.
1:49:57|1:50:18|She looked at the people in the banquet hall and then turned to look at General Wu. General Wu gestured with one hand for her to come in. The waiters inside smiled at him as she walked into the banquet hall and saw her father-in-law, mother-in-law, and her own mother standing on the side, everyone smiling at her.
1:50:31|1:50:47|Mom pulled her hand through the crowd in the banquet hall, the crowd parted layer by layer to reveal [Cao Dapeng] inside. [Cao Dapeng] was standing upright in a suit with his hands behind his back. Mom tugged at [Tian Haixin] with her hand.
1:50:49|1:51:11|[Tian Haixin] broke free from her mother's hand, [Cao Dapeng] saw this and walked towards her with a microphone, then took her hand and led her to the center of the banquet hall. [Tian Haixin] did not resist, keeping her head down and looking at the ground. She allowed [Cao Dapeng] to lead her forward, as he raised the microphone.
1:54:20|1:54:34|After speaking, he knelt down on one knee and picked up a pair of baby shoes.
1:54:37|1:54:44|Tian Haixin laughed at the baby shoes, dropped her handbag, and took the baby shoes from [Cao Dapeng]'s hands.
1:55:38|1:55:54|Relatives and friends slowly walked into the wedding venue, taking their seats in the audience area and waiting for the wedding to begin. At this moment, [Cao Dapeng] was gently caressing [Tian Haixin]'s belly, which had grown a bit in the two months.
1:56:34|1:56:54|[Wen Yi] left the noisy wedding venue and walked towards the nearby lake. Her skirt and hair were gently blown by the wind, dancing in the breeze. [Gu Xiaolei] had already changed into her wedding dress and was waiting in the makeup tent for [Ye Wenwen] to help her straighten the hem of the dress.
1:56:56|1:57:14|Chen [Zhen Xuan] was circling around [Gu Xiaolei], moving his hands on the hem of the wedding dress, then he ran behind her to carefully look at the veil. He bent down and fiddled with something around [Gu Xiaolei]'s waist. [Ye Wenwen] slapped his hand away.
1:57:18|1:57:24|After he finished checking the wedding dress by bending down, [Ye Wenwen] couldn't help but laugh at his actions.
1:57:46|1:57:53|[Wen Yi] sat alone on a bench by the lake, listening to the commentary at the wedding scene.
