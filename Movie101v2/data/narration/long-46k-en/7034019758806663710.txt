0:1:26|0:1:37|She pressed the record button and said. After hanging up the phone, [Xiao Xia] stepped out of the door.
0:1:39|0:1:55|At this moment, a plane from Cyprus to Beijing Airport is slowly landing. The departure hall is bustling with people, and among them is [Lao Cui], wearing a down jacket and carrying a large suitcase. Just as the plane touches down, his phone rings and [Lao Cui] hurriedly takes it out to answer.
0:2:18|0:2:24|Lao Cui, who returned to China to make a fortune and honor his ancestors, had to buy a ticket back home before even leaving the airport.
0:2:40|0:2:52|The beautiful flight attendant could only conceal her surprise with a sweet smile. Then she stamped the boarding pass neatly and set off on the journey of this film. The first stop for [Lao Cui] returning home turned out to be the Civil Affairs Bureau.
0:2:52|0:3:8|The staff member, expressionless, held the divorce certificate and stamped it forcefully, then stamped it hard on top. [Lao Cui] and his wife sat quietly. With the new divorce certificate settled, the pregnant ex-wife outside the door turned back and returned the pendant to [Lao Cui].
0:3:10|0:3:23|[Lao Cui] looked up, only to see his wife getting into someone else's car. He glanced at the rearview mirror and saw that it was his childhood friend. With wide eyes, [Lao Cui] said incredulously. After saying that, his wife got into the car.
0:3:25|0:3:40|[Lao Cui] looked at the pixiu pendant in his hand, feeling sad in his heart. Coming all the way back from a foreign country to his hometown, he couldn't bring honor to his ancestors, and even his once warm family had fallen apart. The big man stood in the empty alley, on the verge of tears.
0:4:11|0:4:16|The beer in his belly also swept away the unhappiness for [Lao Cui].
0:4:57|0:5:12|In the nightclub, the good buddies were dancing among the girls, the dazzling lights creating a passionate atmosphere. After it ended, [Lao Cui] walked alone on the streets of winter Beijing, carrying a box. The bustling street was brightly lit, with a constant flow of traffic.
0:5:12|0:5:29|The drunken [Lao Cui] staggered along the road, looking even more lonely and desolate. He looked back reluctantly at the journey he had just taken, perhaps reminiscing about his past. After walking for who knows how long, the alcohol on [Lao Cui] also dissipated. He raised his hand to hail a taxi, and inside the car, he sat gloomily staring out at the neon lights.
0:5:29|0:5:38|The streetlight reflected on his slightly weathered face, and suddenly a girl rushed out onto the road, it was [Xiao Xia].
0:5:46|0:5:57|[Xiao Xia] in the car looked back nervously, and when she saw that the two men didn't chase after them, she breathed a sigh of relief and put down the knife.
0:6:21|0:6:27|Upon hearing this, [Xiao Xia] placed her hand on [Lao Cui]'s shoulder, leaned in close, and asked with a mouth full of alcohol.
0:6:52|0:7:7|[Lao Cui] took advantage of [Xiao Xia] being asleep, threw the knife out, glanced guiltily at [Xiao Xia], and gently rolled up the car window. With the alcohol kicking in, [Xiao Xia] leaned drowsily on [Lao Cui]'s shoulder and naturally wrapped her arms around [Lao Cui]'s arm. [Lao Cui] had no choice but to pay the price for his kindness.
0:7:9|0:7:24|The car slowly stopped at the entrance of the residential area, [Xiao Xia] felt nauseous and vomited on [Lao Cui]'s chest.
0:8:8|0:8:22|The unlucky guy [Lao Cui] was left behind supporting [Xiao Xia]. Turning around, [Xiao Xia] looked like she was going to vomit, and [Lao Cui] quickly went up to pat her back. [Xiao Xia] sat on the ground with a thud.
0:8:40|0:8:53|Seeing the other party indifferent, [Lao Cui] also felt a bit troubled. He helplessly raised his hand to check the time, then glanced at [Xiao Xia] on the ground. After hesitating for a moment, he picked up the box and turned to leave. But just as he took a couple of steps, the phone on [Xiao Xia]'s body suddenly rang.
0:8:59|0:9:9|Hearing the sound, [Lao Cui] turned around, pondered for a moment, reached into his pocket and took out his phone, then answered the call without much thought.
0:9:57|0:10:21|Lao Cui, who took the key, struggled to open the door for a while, but it was opened from the inside by someone. Inside, four fierce men were playing mahjong. Lao Cui dared not speak, while Xiao Xia pointed to another household, where the person simply closed the door. Finally, he escorted Xiao Xia back home.
0:10:22|0:10:37|[Lao Cui] placed [Xiao Xia] on the sofa, making sure she was lying comfortably before realizing the vomit on his clothes. Frowning, he glanced down at it and then checked the time. Deciding to start washing clothes right there, he went into the bathroom, wearing a tank top and scrubbing the clothes in front of the mirror.
0:10:37|0:10:45|Lost in his thoughts while bathing, he looked up and saw [Xiao Xia] passing by in the mirror. Perhaps still in a daze, [Xiao Xia] had forgotten about the presence of this outsider in the house.
0:10:45|0:10:58|[Lao Cui] saw [Xiao Xia] heading to the bathroom, so he quickly retreated outside the door and turned off the light. Soon after, he saw [Xiao Xia] coming out of the bathroom. [Lao Cui] then returned to the bathroom with his clothes, checked the time, and continued to scrub the clothes with his head down.
0:11:1|0:11:18|Xiao Xia noticed the problem and approached the mirror, staring at the unfamiliar fat man in confusion. She yanked open the door and pulled Lao Cui out of the bathroom, giving him a kick before he could react. Lao Cui, looking bewildered, sadly stared at the door.
0:11:18|0:11:28|Winter in Beijing is not easy, especially with only a vest on. It was already 11:54 according to his watch, so he went up and knocked on the door.
0:12:7|0:12:21|[Lao Cui] was quite frightened. The fierce neighbor in a coat looked [Lao Cui] up and down, sneered disdainfully at his miserable appearance, and then coldly laughed before returning to his own house.
0:12:22|0:12:27|The neighbor rushed out again, pointing at the sound-controlled light, said [Lao Cui].
0:12:28|0:12:47|The neighbor cast a disdainful glance, [Lao Cui] simply went back to the room to continue playing cards. Seeing the door closed, [Lao Cui] then stealthily approached [Xiao Xia]'s door. Just as he was about to knock, he seemed to remember the fierce neighbor, so he secretly glanced in that direction. He hugged his arms and leaned into the door, softly calling out.
0:12:55|0:13:8|The phone suddenly rang, and [Lao Cui] hurriedly searched his pockets, thinking it was his own phone, only to find [Xiao Xia]'s phone, and saw that it was the number that had just been broadcast.
0:13:9|0:13:24|In the corridor, Guangguang and Xiao Wu walked quickly, Lao Cui stepped forward and headed straight for Xiao Xia's door.
0:13:41|0:13:49|[Guangguang] glared fiercely at the neighbor, who looked a bit intimidated by the burly [Guangguang]. Lao Wu kept smashing the door.
0:13:55|0:14:13|The neighbor went back into the house and brought out a beer bottle. Lao Wu snatched the bottle and smashed it on the neighbor's head. [Guangguang] pushed Lao Wu, causing the neighbor's forehead to bleed profusely, frightening everyone in the room.
0:14:17|0:14:25|[Lao Cui] hides behind the door frame as two groups of people fight. [Guangguang] watches but doesn't take advantage of the situation.
0:14:29|0:14:35|Taking care of Lao Wu, who ran downstairs, several neighbors naturally followed suit, with [Lao Cui] stepping forward to continue knocking on the door.
0:14:49|0:14:56|Suddenly, Lao Cui felt that something was not right with the atmosphere. When he turned around, he found that the four neighbors who had returned at some point had already surrounded him.
0:15:0|0:15:8|This straight punch sent several people to the police station, the comical [Lao Cui] wearing a police uniform jacket, with a piece of paper stuffed in his nose, apparently bleeding a lot.
0:16:39|0:16:45|Childhood friend led [Lao Cui] out of the police station, and the phone rang.
0:17:31|0:17:46|The crew van of the Jing Ke's Secret Room drove away like that, while [Lao Cui] picked out a long official robe and walked on the road, attracting the attention and whispers of passersby. People passing by tried to stay away, afraid of getting involved with this lunatic. [Lao Cui] ran all the way to [Xiao Xia]'s house.
0:17:47|0:17:59|On the stairs, he tiptoed cautiously, afraid of running into the tough guys from yesterday. After looking around for a while and seeing no one else, he finally climbed up the stairs. [Lao Cui] first went to the neighbor's house, leaned against the door and listened carefully.
0:18:1|0:18:8|Faint opera music could be heard from inside, making [Lao Cui] instantly nervous as he cautiously walked towards [Xiao Xia]'s door.
0:18:22|0:18:31|At this moment, a phone in his pocket rang, and [Lao Cui] felt it was not his own phone. It turned out that he had accidentally taken [Xiao Xia]'s phone with him last night.
0:19:49|0:19:57|[Lao Cui] hung up the phone and went downstairs. In the corner, brothers Guangguang and Lao Wu were tailing him, silently following [Lao Cui].
0:19:58|0:20:9|In the bustling pedestrian overpass in the city, [Lao Cui] in official attire stands out, attracting the attention of the crowd. The honest man just wants to quickly retrieve the item and end this nightmare.
0:20:9|0:20:28|The pedestrian bridge was bustling with people, but there was no sign of [Xiao Xia]. Two patrolling police officers approached, and [Lao Cui] quickly turned his back, even the officers couldn't help but tease. Just then, the phone in [Lao Cui]'s pocket rang.
0:20:46|0:20:58|Lao Cui in a long robe and gown was jumping in place, looking terrified, which amused the passersby. He was bouncing with all his might,
0:21:2|0:21:16|At this moment, a trendy girl with curly hair and wearing leather boots walked onto the overpass, it was [Xiao Xia]. She stopped her steps about ten meters away, while [Lao Cui] eagerly ran up to her.
0:21:47|0:22:6|After speaking, he ran away, and Lao Cui hurried to chase after him. In the bustling crowd on the overpass, Xiao Xia ran ahead, followed closely by Lao Cui in a long robe, and finally Guangguang and Juan Mao. The chase quickly moved from the overpass to inside the mall, with Xiao Xia not blindly running, but taking advantage of the crowded elevator to sprint.
0:22:7|0:22:24|[Lao Cui]'s bulky figure was no match for [Xiao Xia]'s agility, but his stamina was good, keeping up closely. Guangguang and Da Bao were afraid of losing track, so they didn't dare to slack off. The group's strange behavior attracted a lot of attention. [Xiao Xia] ran into the first floor of the mall, saw the sign for the restroom, and headed straight for the women's restroom.
0:22:27|0:22:41|The young girl inside the room just walked out and saw the oddly dressed [Lao Cui], couldn't help but scream. Just as she turned around, she saw Guangguang and Juan Mao, and the group of them climbed out of the window of the women's restroom.
0:22:46|0:22:59|The low wall was lined with several steel bars, and he carefully climbed over it. [Lao Cui] followed without hesitation. The problem was his wide robe, which got caught on the steel bars behind his butt.
0:23:0|0:23:15|[Lao Cui] was hung on the wall, and when he looked down, he saw an old lady burning paper next to him. The old lady mistook [Lao Cui] for a demon in ancient costume and ran away in fear.
0:23:15|0:23:23|Lao Cui, feeling burning with anger, struggled to take off his coat and jumped directly from the wall, bumping into Xiao Xia in the alley.
0:23:33|0:23:46|Poor [Lao Cui], wearing a vest and holding up his pants, was mistaken for a pervert. Meanwhile, [Xiao Xia] ran to the old iron gate and squeezed through the chains. After struggling for a while, [Lao Cui], with his bulky figure, had no choice but to climb over the gate.
0:23:46|0:23:53|Then, the round Guangguang rushed over, panting heavily. Xiao Xia had just taken a few steps when Lao Wu stopped her.
0:24:2|0:24:13|Guangguang looked pleased with himself. Lao Cui at the door could only watch anxiously, while Qun Tou, who took a detour, was approaching Xiao Xia menacingly. Xiao Xia was just about to turn and run.
0:24:44|0:24:48|Lao Cui on the door watched as Xiao Xia was taken away by two people.
0:27:16|0:27:25|Guangguang turned around and forcefully threw the key out of the window.
0:28:2|0:28:14|In the office, Tang Jinshan suddenly stood up as he looked at the photos of several people, then turned around and asked his subordinates.
0:28:25|0:28:30|Tang Jinshan leaned back in the boss chair, pondering, and then slowly sat up.
0:29:4|0:29:15|[Lao Cui] pushed and found that the top of the iron ladder was broken. The two changed their plan and climbed up the ladder. They freed themselves by passing the handcuffs through the break.
0:29:16|0:29:23|The two of them climbed to the highest point, both struggling to lift their arms.
0:29:32|0:29:37|[Lao Cui] picked up the phone and the two of them shook the creaky wooden door.
0:30:13|0:30:31|[Xiao Xia] jingled the handcuffs in her hand, sizing up [Lao Cui] with a mischievous look. [Lao Cui] couldn't help but feel nervous, the poor man only had a vest left, unable to resist [Xiao Xia]'s sharp gaze.
0:30:33|0:30:39|Saying that, [Lao Cui] untied the belt around his waist, leaving only his long johns inside.
0:31:3|0:31:7|After some contemplation, [Xiao Xia] also started to whistle.
0:31:16|0:31:35|The two people who were already close suddenly emitted this smell, causing [Xiao Xia] to cover her nose and mouth. Fortunately, they found a steel bar, and the two twisted the hollow fence with their pants. The hollow fence quickly bent over. After going through some hardships, the two finally came out. [Xiao Xia] picked up the handcuff key.
0:31:37|0:31:50|Heading straight home. Running to the staircase, [Xiao Xia] noticed that the door was open. So she slowed down, glanced inside to make sure there was no one, and then ran up. [Lao Cui] followed behind, holding his arm.
0:31:52|0:32:10|In the winter of the north, life is not easy. They entered the house one after the other, only to be shocked by the messy scene inside. [Xiao Xia] hurriedly ran, seemingly searching for something. [Lao Cui] headed towards his luggage, but the things in his pockets were missing.
0:32:10|0:32:18|[Lao Cui] panicked, while [Xiao Xia] found a wristband from a bathhouse in the bag. On the other side,
0:32:28|0:32:36|Even though the room was messy, [Xiao Xia] seemed not to care at all. She walked into the living room with a stuffed toy in her hand.
0:32:53|0:33:0|[Lao Cui], who was putting on his pants, suddenly felt a tightness in his heart and squatted down again.
0:34:24|0:34:34|The two sat down at the table, and [Xiao Xia] lowered her head and said affectionately.
0:35:16|0:35:34|The two brothers at the repair shop were ready for anything. Just as they said that, Guangguang, who had just thrown away his lunchbox, looked up and saw Tang Jinshan's group outside the window. There were about six or seven of them, sneaking in with steel bars and hammers. Guangguang immediately hid behind some large tires, craning his neck to observe secretly.
0:35:34|0:35:41|Seeing several people approaching the repair shop, [Guangguang] quickly ran towards the back, looking back as he ran, and slipped out through the back door.
0:35:43|0:35:57|Unaware, Lao Wu was still squatting in the toilet, calling out for Guangguang. A figure quietly approached the door of the toilet, then a hand wrapped in bandages pulled back the curtain. Guangge and Lao Wu saw Tang Jinshan in front of them.
0:35:58|0:36:21|Tang Jinshan brought a water gun, and [Lao Wu] was hung up and soaked with a high-pressure water gun, while Tang Jinshan used an electric fan to blow him. On the other side, [Xiao Xia] had already brought [Lao Cui] to the vicinity of the bath center. The two of them hid behind a car in the parking lot, with [Xiao Xia] instructing [Lao Cui].
0:36:30|0:36:37|Nervous Lao Cui enters, holding a handkerchief and greeting with a door camp, asking about the bracelet whenever he meets someone.
0:36:40|0:36:46|For the first time at the bathhouse, [Lao Cui] was completely clueless about the process. With the help of the attendant, he sat down on the sofa in the lobby.
0:36:47|0:36:55|He nervously changed into his slippers, but noticed the sign for the amusement park.
0:37:3|0:37:19|The waiter on the phone covered the first letter of the sign for the non-member area, and [Lao Cui], who walked in directly, made the first mistake. The non-member area was bustling with customers coming and going, most of them wearing towels and bare-chested. Someone like [Lao Cui], dressed in a cotton jacket and scarf, stood out.
0:37:19|0:37:36|Before long, [Lao Cui] followed the directions on the sign and found locker 263. He walked in and examined the locker, pressing the bracelet hard against the lock on the door, but there was no response at all. The non-member area and the member area were naturally not the same place, so it was only natural that the lock wouldn't open.
0:37:36|0:37:51|Unaware, [Lao Cui] tried the lock again and again, but to no avail. He looked at the cabinet door again, confirming it was 263. So, he pressed down hard once more, his hand passing by the middle-aged man who had just finished bathing, eyeing [Lao Cui] up and down.
0:37:51|0:37:59|[Lao Cui], who had been trying his best, had to restrain himself and pretended to imitate the other person naturally.
0:38:1|0:38:24|With a light press from the other party, the door opened, and [Lao Cui] muttered to himself as if explaining to others. The uncle was not interested in him at all and walked past him. [Lao Cui] watched him leave, then turned around and pressed his own wristband vigorously. The waiter walked over, and [Lao Cui] quickly stopped.
0:38:27|0:38:34|Fortunately, [Lao Cui] was not discovered. At the door, [Xiao Xia] was approached by someone. [Xiao Xia] turned around to see the person looking shifty.
0:38:56|0:39:11|Facing the door of the wardrobe, [Lao Cui] punched and kicked, exerting all his strength to pull open the door lock, which then bounced back because he pulled too hard. [Lao Cui] stood there in a daze, and when he finally reacted and looked, the customers in the next corridor were peeking at him with their heads out.
0:39:11|0:39:18|The character [Lao Cui], who caused such a commotion, quickly hid away. After a while, he cautiously stuck his head out, saw that everyone had left, and then opened the door.
0:39:18|0:39:42|In the cabinet lies a bundle of cloth. [Lao Cui] is afraid of having nightmares, so he wraps the whole thing up and hurriedly stuffs it into his arms. Then he gently closes the broken cabinet door, sticks his head out to look around, sees no one, and tiptoes outside. Just a few steps out, he runs into the onlookers he saw earlier.
0:39:42|0:39:50|The guilty Lao Cui dare not look up, just lowering his head and quickening his pace, while the thug at the door presses the trigger, but flames shoot out, turns out it's a lighter.
0:39:51|0:39:57|Xiao Xia scared off the hooligans with just one shout.
0:40:1|0:40:12|The two hurriedly left the troubled place with their package and went to a high-end restaurant instead, where the table was filled with delicious dishes like abalone and lobster. They ate heartily.
0:40:18|0:40:26|[Xiao Xia] gestured to the waiter to come over.
0:40:28|0:40:46|After finishing speaking, Lao Cui, who had eaten and drunk his fill, looked sideways as Xiao Xia took out various press passes and even police credentials from her bag, which greatly frightened Lao Cui. Xiao Xia, unable to find the money, searched around again, and this time she was completely stunned.
0:40:52|0:40:57|She showed the gun in her bag to [Lao Cui], which scared him into immediately standing up and sitting back down.
0:41:22|0:41:28|The two of them were stunned when they heard the price.
0:41:32|0:41:39|The two who couldn't afford to pay the bill could only stall for time, with [Lao Cui] nervously saying to [Xiao Xia].
0:41:51|0:41:57|After speaking, [Lao Cui] started to search his pockets and then pushed her hand away.
0:42:10|0:42:29|Under the gaze of the waiter and the lobby manager, [Lao Cui] picked up a hair from the dish, [Xiao Xia] looked solemnly at the manager, and then [Xiao Xia] showed the fake ID in her bag to start deceiving.
0:42:43|0:42:49|Lao Cui, pretending to be the editor-in-chief, nodded calmly as Xiao Xia tied up her hair.
0:43:6|0:43:18|[Lao Cui] and [Xiao Xia] exchanged a glance, both of them sighed solemnly. Then, they walked out the door with their heads held high, took a few steps, suddenly quickened their pace and started to jog, afraid of being discovered.
0:43:52|0:44:1|In the roadside convenience store, the process of [Lao Cui] prying open the cabinet door happened to be playing on TV. The two people watched as [Lao Cui] walked out of the non-member area, leaving [Xiao Xia] gritting her teeth.
0:44:4|0:44:10|Lao Cui, as quiet as a cicada in winter, quickly turned his head and slipped away.
0:44:21|0:44:38|The two returned to Xiao Xia's house and saw many people busy inside through the crack in the door, seemingly searching for something. Xiao Xia and Lao Cui approached, unaware of Tang Jinshan approaching in the corridor behind them. He whispered.
0:44:54|0:45:4|In the alley, [Xiao Xia] took the lead and led the way to escape. [Lao Cui] still carried his suitcase and ran wildly with his sleeves rolled up. Tang Jinshan's group was much more ruthless than Guangguang, naturally they chased relentlessly.
0:45:5|0:45:20|Soon, [Xiao Xia] ran past a temple on the mainland, with a prominent "南无阿弥陀佛" printed on the wall. But just as Tang Jinshan's group caught up, they immediately started to retreat, stepping back with small steps, losing the imposing momentum they had just now.
0:45:20|0:45:26|It turned out that [Lao Cui] pulled out the gun and pressed Tang Jinshan closely, pointing at the wall.
0:45:52|0:46:2|[Xiao Xia] listened to the conversation outside. While [Lao Cui] took the opportunity to turn his head and run.
0:46:3|0:46:17|After Tang Jinshan and the others regained their senses, they realized that [Lao Cui] was missing and that they had been tricked. They quickly chased after him, but couldn't determine the direction he had fled. Tang Jinshan, the leader, bit down on a direction and gave the order.
0:46:17|0:46:37|The manhole cover on the ground moved, and it turned out that Lao Cui and Xiao Xia, knowing they were no match, had already slipped into the manhole. The two of them said in unison. It was only then that they let down their guard and calmed their minds.
0:46:39|0:47:0|[Lao Cui] puts the gun back into the bag, holding the bag tightly against his chest. The key to the problem just now puzzled [Xiao Xia], who shook her head in confusion.
0:47:4|0:47:20|The two of them didn't know how long they had been waiting, until [Xiao Xia] finally brought [Lao Cui] to the residential building. [Xiao Xia] took out the key from the shoe cabinet and opened the door.
0:47:21|0:47:30|The room is a large open space, with the dining room, living room, and bedroom all in one.
0:48:30|0:48:43|The slow-witted Lao Cui finally figured it out, and suddenly he had a bright idea. Qun Tou was at home drinking beer with the actress, with candles lit on the side.
0:48:44|0:48:52|He put down the wine glass and said solemnly.
0:49:0|0:49:9|At a critical moment, a phone call came in.
0:49:22|0:49:35|Once again he hung up the phone, creating a good atmosphere, holding the actress's hand with interlocking fingers. The actress was very moved.
0:49:59|0:50:18|After finishing the call, Lao Cui hung up in a hurry and returned to the room. He gently lifted the weeping actress and placed his hand on her face. After a moment of contemplation, he said, "Xiao Xia is lying on the bed behind the curtain."
0:50:33|0:50:41|Lao Cui, lying on the sofa covered with a blanket, said somewhat melancholy.
0:51:30|0:51:36|[Xiao Xia] pondered for a moment.
0:51:43|0:51:52|[Lao Cui], just about to cheer them up, suddenly thought of something and sat up. He tentatively asked.
0:52:4|0:52:9|Upon hearing this, [Lao Cui] smiled reassuringly and lay back down.
0:52:18|0:52:25|[Xiao Xia] took out the passport from her pocket. After hesitating for a moment, she put it back.
0:52:33|0:52:48|[Xiao Xia] seemed a little guilty. The next morning, the two of them sneakily arrived at a hotel corridor. [Lao Cui] changed into a denim outfit, looking particularly young. He gently knocked on the door.
0:52:55|0:53:5|He gave a false name in a hoarse voice, punched the door open, and [Lao Cui] rushed in only to be pushed out again.
0:53:13|0:53:18|The man in the dragon robe was thrown off, [Lao Cui] charged in again, but in a blink of an eye, he backed out on his own.
0:53:32|0:53:40|After an awkward exchange of pleasantries, the actress quickly slipped out the door, and [Lao Cui] then introduced Fist. Fist nodded quickly.
0:53:46|0:53:54|[Lao Cui] sat down awkwardly, Qun Tou asked, and Qun Tou put on the dragon robe.
0:54:12|0:54:24|Fist glanced at [Xiao Xia] beside him and pointed, saying. [Xiao Xia] vetoed him.
0:54:42|0:54:52|Disguised [Xiao Xia] and [Lao Cui] once again arrived at the entrance of the bathhouse. [Lao Cui] instructed [Xiao Xia] that as soon as they enter, there is a restroom on the left side where they should put their things.
0:55:4|0:55:7|Xiao Xia walked nervously towards the bathhouse after finishing the task.
0:55:8|0:55:18|After seeing off Xiao Xia, Lao Cui turned around and saw a wanted poster on the nearby pillar with his own face on it. In a panic, he quickly tore the whole poster off.
0:55:21|0:55:30|Shortly after, wearing those women's sunglasses, [Xiao Xia] nervously surveyed the surroundings. Meanwhile, [Lao Cui] had already entered the bathhouse, where many police officers had arrived in the lobby.
0:55:50|0:55:59|[Xiao Xia] turned around to leave, but saw the thug from last time. [Xiao Xia] quickly reached for the gun and switched it.
0:56:20|0:56:38|Lao Cui quietly threw the stolen lighter gun back at the door. By the roadside, Lao Cui was still squatting on the ground, tearing the wanted poster into pieces in disbelief. Xiao Xia quickly ran over, and Lao Cui picked up the shredded paper and stood up.
0:56:50|0:56:58|The two took a detour and arrived at the back door of the bathhouse, only to see two police officers on the iron ladder at the back door.
0:57:36|0:57:41|After speaking, [Xiao Xia] turned and left, leaving [Lao Cui] to watch her back as he suddenly turned over and started crying.
0:57:42|0:57:59|[Xiao Xia] once again entered the lobby, but most of the people coming and going were probably police officers. She put her hands in her pockets, lowered her head, and prepared to pass through unnoticed.
0:58:2|0:58:14|At that moment, the thug lighting a cigarette pulled the trigger. The hotel lobby descended into chaos, with the hotel staff fleeing in panic.
0:58:19|0:58:25|He spoke, then pulled the trigger, and the bullet shot towards the ceiling. The police surrounded him, and [Xiao Xia] also found an opportunity.
0:58:26|0:58:45|Excited, [Xiao Xia] danced with joy, releasing all the pent-up frustration from the harassment that day. Unimpeded, [Xiao Xia] made her way to the men's changing room, opened a locker, rummaged through her purse, and pulled out a thick envelope. She gently tore it open, revealing a stack of US dollars inside, and contentedly whistled to herself.
0:58:46|0:58:54|[Xiao Xia] returned home and sat at the dining table, completely focused on counting the US dollars.
0:59:13|0:59:34|[Lao Cui]'s expression suddenly changed, he solemnly examined the US dollars, then raised them up to look at them in the sunlight.
0:59:42|0:59:51|Xiao Xia listened with only partial understanding, so she also picked up the US dollars and looked at them like Lao Cui did. Lao Cui then exchanged for another bill, shook it, and examined it carefully.
0:59:55|1:0:1|Xiao Xia's face turned serious as she pondered about what happened on the day she received the money.
1:0:13|1:0:24|[Da Bao] struck Tang Jinshan's hand with an axe, and finally [Da Bao] opened the safe, took out a leather bag from inside, and checked the US dollars inside.
1:0:29|1:0:38|Guangguang and the other two left with the money, not long after, Tang Jinshan arrived with his men.
1:0:40|1:0:50|On the basement floor of the mall, Guangguang and the others were running frantically. However, after running out, Da Bao at the back turned around and ran in the opposite direction alone with the money.
1:0:51|1:0:56|Tang Jinshan covered the wound on his hand and chased after Lao Cui and his men relentlessly.
1:0:58|1:1:7|[Da Bao] ran and pushed aside the pedestrians on the road, running all the way to the bathhouse. He put his bag in the locker room, locked the door, and then went into the bathhouse.
1:1:10|1:1:24|Tang Jinshan was stopped, and [Da Bao] sneaked into the water at this moment. However, as soon as he entered the water, two big thick legs were thrust in, and [Da Bao] held his breath and looked outside, only to see the tattooed big brother coming to take a bath.
1:1:25|1:1:45|Tang Jinshan finally arrived, panting, surveying the surroundings. In the water, Da Bao secretly observed the other party. Seeing Tang Jinshan looking around in vain for a while and leaving with his men, Da Bao stood up from the water. The tattooed man bathing was startled. On the other side, Guangguang couldn't reach Da Bao.
1:2:28|1:2:44|[Lao Cui] was secretly pleased, but [Xiao Xia] remained indifferent. After speaking, [Lao Cui] went to the bathroom, leaving [Xiao Xia] sitting there in a daze.
1:2:52|1:3:16|Lao Cui was still envisioning the future in the bathroom. Xiao Xia, who had made up her mind, left with the money. When Lao Cui, who had finished using the toilet, looked around the room, Xiao Xia was nowhere to be seen. He looked around and then opened the door, calling out her name, but there was no response in the corridor outside.
1:3:17|1:3:34|Reluctant [Lao Cui] returned to the room, only to find that the bag on the table was missing. He opened a drawer and seemed to be searching for something. He searched from the bedside table to the desk, until he found a palm-sized phone book, from which he found Guangguang's phone number.
1:3:34|1:3:38|Picked up the phone at home, dialed two numbers, and then put it back.
1:4:6|1:4:17|At the same time, [Xiao Xia] arrived at the hotel where she had agreed to meet [Da Bao] and knocked on the door. [Da Bao] picked up the bottle of wine on the table and went to open the door.
1:4:18|1:4:30|Upon hearing Xiao Xia's voice, he finally relaxed and unlocked the door latch, letting Xiao Xia in. While Xiao Xia entered the room, Da Bao remained vigilant at the door, looking around anxiously, afraid of being followed.
1:4:31|1:4:39|After locking the door, the long-separated couple embraced each other passionately, with [Da Bao] kissing [Xiao Xia] on the bed.
1:4:41|1:4:48|Upon hearing this, [Da Bao] suddenly stopped and slowly stood up, gazing at [Xiao Xia] in front of him.
1:5:3|1:5:15|[Da Bao] forcefully pushed away [Xiao Xia], took a few steps, turned his back, pondered for a moment, then walked aggressively back to [Xiao Xia]. [Xiao Xia] nervously looked at this familiar man.
1:5:19|1:5:39|[Da Bao] became suspicious, which startled [Xiao Xia], and at that moment, [Da Bao] dialed the home landline. [Xiao Xia] approached and tried to calm him down, but was slapped to the ground by [Da Bao].
1:5:46|1:6:0|After speaking, [Da Bao] dragged and pushed [Guangguang] out the door. [Xiao Xia] leaned tightly against the corridor wall. The hotel door was locked by [Da Bao], and at the same time, [Lao Cui] arrived at the familiar overpass with a bag.
1:6:0|1:6:13|Compared to the last ridiculous outfit, this time [Lao Cui] lowered his hat brim, wrapped in a coat, calmly walked on the overpass. [Guangguang] and [Juan Mao], who had been waiting for a long time, looked at [Lao Cui] while smoking.
1:6:33|1:6:49|[Lao Cui] opened his briefcase without hesitation, showing it to the two of them. [Da Bao] jokingly took out a piece of cardboard from his waist, on which the word "passport" was written in watercolor. [Guangguang] held up his homemade passport and walked forward.
1:6:49|1:6:59|[Lao Cui] handed over the bag, and suddenly a figure rushed out from the overpass and knocked the bag into the air. The bag fell from high above and landed on a three-wheeled cart used for selling fruits.
1:7:40|1:7:48|[Lao Cui] failed to get the passport, knowing that the fruit stall owner Lao Wu got the briefcase instead. Dejected, [Lao Cui] returned home with a dejected look, as if he had lost his spirit.
1:7:50|1:8:8|He slowly closed the door, only to find [Xiao Xia] sitting on the floor in front of the sofa, holding a whole bottle of red wine and drinking it straight from the bottle. After taking a big gulp, she wiped her mouth, tears welling up in her eyes. [Lao Cui] turned back in disappointment.
1:8:10|1:8:16|However, to his surprise, Xiao Xia pulled out a passport, causing Lao Cui to have a big change in attitude.
1:8:18|1:8:33|The expression on his face shifted from disappointment to anger. [Lao Cui] set down the box and snatched the passport, carefully flipping through it to confirm that it was indeed his own. Without missing a beat, he angrily threw it to the ground.
1:9:21|1:9:29|[Xiao Xia], who was already feeling aggrieved, now broke down emotionally.
1:10:16|1:10:34|Seeing [Xiao Xia] crying uncontrollably, the kind-hearted [Lao Cui] had to comfort her first. He put down the suitcase in his hand and brought a cup of hot water to [Xiao Xia]. As [Xiao Xia], sitting on the sofa, gradually quieted down, [Lao Cui] squatted in front of her with the cup.
1:10:36|1:10:53|Xiao Xia didn't respond, Lao Cui called an ambulance without hesitation. Inside the ambulance, under the care of medical staff, Xiao Xia received IV fluids and oxygen. Lao Cui, sitting beside her, anxiously watched Xiao Xia, who finally woke up.
1:11:20|1:11:31|[Lao Cui] stood there holding a bunch of medicine without saying a word.
1:11:39|1:11:47|[Lao Cui] blinked in confusion, interrupted, and then turned to leave.
1:11:52|1:12:0|[Xiao Xia] became anxious, [Lao Cui] blinked but didn't say anything. However, the clever [Xiao Xia] guessed what was going on, and [Lao Cui] sighed in resignation.
1:12:3|1:12:17|[Lao Cui] turned and walked away, leaving [Xiao Xia] standing there in a daze before she caught up. The two of them quietly turned the corner of the corridor without saying another word. It seemed like [Lao Cui] had seen something, as he turned back.
1:13:40|1:13:45|[Lao Cui] had a grim expression and quickened his pace. [Xiao Xia], on the other hand, was all smiles and soon arrived home.
1:13:47|1:13:55|The two got out of the car one after the other and arrived at the entrance of the community where they first met. [Xiao Xia] walked quickly inside with a stern face, but was stopped by [Lao Cui].
1:14:5|1:14:16|[Lao Cui] thought for a moment and asked, [Xiao Xia] shook her head, [Lao Cui] pursed his lips, and finally understood.
1:14:18|1:14:24|He moved the box to his left hand, took out a stack of cash from his pocket, nodded, and handed it to [Xiao Xia].
1:14:34|1:14:42|[Lao Cui] put down the suitcase directly, and stuffed the cash into [Xiao Xia]'s pocket with both hands. [Xiao Xia], who is tough on the outside but soft-hearted, was touched.
1:14:58|1:15:9|[Lao Cui] looked at her and spoke. Just as he was about to leave, he was called back, and [Lao Cui] turned around slowly.
1:15:22|1:15:42|[Lao Cui] has left, and [Xiao Xia] should return to her normal life. Back at home, [Xiao Xia] takes photos of herself with her new phone, posing in various cute styles in front of the camera. Suddenly, there is a knock on the door.
1:15:50|1:16:0|[Lao Cui] walked into the house with vegetables in hand, and [Xiao Xia] couldn't contain her excitement.
1:16:12|1:16:30|Angry [Guangguang] slammed the tools on the table towards the makeshift toilet. The fake US dollars in hand made him particularly unhappy. So he picked up [Xiao Xia]'s phone on the table out of boredom, then pressed on the phone recording interface, playing the recording.
1:16:51|1:16:54|[Guangguang] quickly packed up the things on the table and left the room directly.
1:17:11|1:17:28|[Tang Jinshan] handed him the paper, while [Da Bao] was eating instant noodles in the hotel. [Guangguang] kicked the door open and looked at [Da Bao] with a frown, sighing deeply. [Xiao Xia] was eating hotpot at home.
1:17:43|1:17:57|[Xiao Xia] said cheerfully. The rising steam from the hotpot set the atmosphere for their farewell, and [Xiao Xia] found her eyes turning red inexplicably. Without lifting her head, [Xiao Xia] spoke.
1:18:0|1:18:7|Lao Cui, with lowered brows, suddenly paused and looked up. Xiao Xia stared at him with red eyes. Lao Cui's gaze seemed evasive.
1:18:15|1:18:22|The speaker unintentionally evoked the sad memories of Lao Cui when Xiao Xia mentioned it.
1:18:57|1:19:7|[Xiao Xia] smiled and handed a new phone to [Lao Cui], saying somewhat proudly.
1:19:11|1:19:17|[Lao Cui] really didn't expect it, feeling a bit touched in his heart, [Xiao Xia] bid farewell to [Lao Cui] after dinner.
1:19:34|1:19:43|[Xiao Xia] jokingly kicked [Lao Cui]'s butt, but couldn't reach it. They both felt a bit sentimental for a moment. [Xiao Xia] then grabbed [Lao Cui]'s hand and placed it on her shoulder.
1:19:45|1:19:53|[Lao Cui] looked at her somewhat timidly, still put down the box, pursed his lips, placed his other hand on her shoulder, and gently embraced her.
1:19:54|1:20:3|[Xiao Xia]'s beautiful eyes welled up with mist, and [Lao Cui] blinked, holding back the tears. After a gentle embrace, [Xiao Xia] seemed somewhat dissatisfied.
1:20:7|1:20:15|[Xiao Xia] didn't turn around, urging [Lao Cui], who bent down and approached [Xiao Xia]'s belly, saying.
1:20:42|1:20:56|[Xiao Xia] couldn't hold back anymore, reaching out to wipe away her tears. "Parting is inevitable after a long journey," the sentimental [Lao Cui] picked up his suitcase and walked away. With a heavy heart, [Lao Cui] turned back and dragged his suitcase along.
1:21:5|1:21:12|[Xiao Xia] walked quickly in anger, snatching the box from his hand and pulling out the handle.
1:21:13|1:21:22|Simple-minded [Lao Cui] nodded in agreement, then dragged the suitcase towards the direction of the airport. [Xiao Xia] watched him, then suddenly turned away.
1:21:23|1:21:30|She walked towards the house with her hands in her coat pockets, tears streaming down her cheeks. Meanwhile, [Lao Cui] had also arrived at the airport.
1:21:31|1:21:50|In the waiting hall, he inserted the new SIM card into the new phone, put the battery in carefully, and closed the back cover. Every move was cautious and steady. When he turned on the phone and saw the portrait on the wallpaper, the cute cat ringtone, and the beautiful face, it once again stirred a mix of emotions in [Lao Cui].
1:21:51|1:22:5|[Lao Cui] held the phone in the palm of his hand, the old man with a troubled destiny seemed indifferent for a moment, his eyes staring blankly into the distance. Tears quickly filled his eyes, and on his weathered face, a look of sorrow involuntarily appeared.
1:22:6|1:22:19|A brief and unexpected encounter, yet it carried rich and thrilling memories. Recalling every detail, the two went from disdain to fighting side by side, and in the end, they parted with reluctance, tears streaming down [Lao Cui]'s face.
1:22:20|1:22:26|On the other side, Xiao Xia returned home, but as she looked up, a figure emerged from the shadows - it was her boyfriend, Da Bao.
1:22:27|1:22:37|[Xiao Xia] looked at him sideways. The sullen [Da Bao] remained silent, and suddenly the door was shut.
1:22:38|1:22:47|[Xiao Xia] suddenly turned around, only to find [Guangguang] hiding behind the door. [Guangguang] glared at [Xiao Xia], menacingly approached, and threw the fake US dollars from the bag onto the table.
1:22:52|1:23:7|At the airport, [Lao Cui] was pulling his luggage towards the gate, his eyes empty. Suddenly, the phone rang. [Lao Cui], who had been holding the phone, glanced at it and immediately answered.
1:23:20|1:23:36|[Lao Cui] stood dumbfounded for a moment, then suddenly turned around, grabbed a box, and ran towards the exit against the crowd. The city wall looked somewhat eerie in the night, and [Lao Cui] arrived at the corner tower. He frantically took out his phone.
1:25:2|1:25:9|[Lao Cui] roared and charged forward, only to be met by [Guangguang]'s dagger. The two of them hung [Lao Cui] upside down on the city wall, slowly lowering his legs.
1:25:28|1:25:34|Guangguang pushed Xiao Xia down, but suddenly a police siren sounded.
1:25:48|1:25:55|Xiao Xia couldn't hold back Lao Cui's bulkiness, Guangguang and Da Bao were caught by Tang Jinshan's men.
1:26:4|1:26:25|[Tang Jinshan] directed the driver to drive away. The alarm on the city wall gradually faded, and the fist at the corner holding a horn walked out sneakily. He looked around and, seeing nothing unusual, accidentally pressed the horn button, signaling to [Qun Tou].
1:26:35|1:26:42|Xiao Xia is almost unable to hold on, Qun Tou and others pull the person up together.
1:27:6|1:27:20|[Lao Cui] followed by kicking, sent the two into the secret room, then walked up to Tang Jinshan with a flattering smile, and Tang Jinshan had someone stuff [Lao Cui] in.
1:27:38|1:27:43|Back at home, Xiao Xia slumped on the sofa, with Lao Cui sitting down next to her. Xiao Xia expressed her concern.
1:27:46|1:27:53|[Lao Cui] was bored and absentmindedly shining a UV light on a US dollar bill, not responding immediately as if lost in thought.
1:27:55|1:28:13|After thinking for a while, [Lao Cui] still didn't know what to do. [Xiao Xia] slowly turned her head, her eyes empty. Suddenly, [Lao Cui] raised his head, blinked his eyes, as if calculating something, and put the counterfeit money detector back on the table.
1:28:14|1:28:23|[Xiao Xia] saw that he did not respond, looking a bit dejected. [Lao Cui] then let out a faint sigh, spoke slowly and weakly.
1:28:29|1:28:42|[Xiao Xia] looked at him strangely, feeling a bit dissatisfied. But this was the biggest concession from [Lao Cui]. He pouted and sat up, picked up the counterfeit money detector on the table, and couldn't help but smile as he shone it on the US dollars on the table.
1:28:42|1:28:57|The ultraviolet lamp in his hand shone here for a while, and then shone there, like the footprints of the two people running around these days. Weary [Lao Cui] slowly buried his head in the collar of his down jacket, and observant [Xiao Xia] suddenly noticed the clues on the US dollars.
1:29:12|1:29:31|The two spread the banknotes in order on the ground, the tedious process attracting them. [Lao Cui] checked the notes with a UV light, while [Xiao Xia] kept changing their positions and order.
1:29:31|1:29:51|[Lao Cui] took a pencil and carefully traced the characters on the banknotes, some of which even had strange lines. [Lao Cui] was meticulous in his work. Time passed unnoticed, and the banknotes on the table were unexpectedly pieced together into a picture. The two of them sat cross-legged on the floor, carefully examining this strange and peculiar painting.
1:29:51|1:29:55|The crisscrossing dashed and solid lines form this huge map.
1:29:59|1:30:8|The two looked at each other in shock.
1:30:16|1:30:23|A group of henchmen rushed up and firmly restrained [Lao Cui]. [Lao Cui] struggled to resist, but was no match, as the henchmen shouted loudly.
1:30:42|1:31:2|The timely arrival of the police unexpectedly became the saviors of the two. A group of people were escorted downstairs, while the neighbors at the door were bound with bandages, gleefully cracking melon seeds. [Xiao Xia], who was walking at the back, casually turned off the lights and locked the door.
1:31:4|1:31:22|[Lao Cui] looked back and met eyes with [Xiao Xia]. Unable to contain her joy, [Xiao Xia] smiled brightly. [Lao Cui] quickly turned around, walked up to her, and the neighbor suddenly became alert, moving away. [Lao Cui] tightly held her hand and said.
1:31:44|1:31:46|In Tang Jinshan's company, the police heard a strange noise.
1:31:47|1:32:0|Several police comrades pulled open the clothes in the closet and listened closely. Lao Wu in the dark room had been beaten up, with bruises all over his face, and even his clothes were stripped off. He was banging his head against the wall.
1:32:31|1:32:51|[Lao Cui] dragged the suitcase towards the boarding gate. And when everything calmed down, [Xiao Xia] also walked home alone in a daze.
1:32:51|1:33:8|The quiet street was filled with traffic, but it had nothing to do with her. Just then, a police car stopped in front of her, and the window rolled down to reveal a familiar face in the back seat.
