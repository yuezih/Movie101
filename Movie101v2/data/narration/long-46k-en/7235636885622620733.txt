0:2:35|0:2:50|The film begins with an old man walking unsteadily in front, followed by a man and a woman. The three of them arrive at the Memorial Hall of the Nanjing Massacre. The walls of the memorial hall are covered with old wartime photos, and glass display cases contain some scattered old objects.
0:2:52|0:3:12|The old man walked steadily, looking around, and suddenly was attracted by a statue. He stopped and walked over, only to see a statue of a naked woman kneeling on the ground, crying with long hair. The old man stared at the statue intently, recalling the cruel and unbearable past of his youth.
0:3:12|0:3:20|As a young man, he was brought to the Japanese military camp, where a Japanese officer pointed at his nose and berated him, accusing him of being unworthy to serve as an officer.
0:3:22|0:3:31|He shouted not to, but was still rudely dragged away by the soldiers. That night, a truck sent all the captured girls to the soldiers' quarters separately.
0:3:31|0:3:43|In a small wooden house, there was only her and a Japanese soldier. The soldier came up and slapped her twice, then took off his clothes and pressed them on her, constantly beating and ravaging her, subjecting her to endless humiliation.
0:3:43|0:3:50|Recalling the tragic past, [Liu Hemei] clutched her head in agony, unable to speak as she almost stumbled to the ground.
0:3:51|0:4:7|Accompanied by the two, they heard a strange noise and hurried over. [Liu Hemei] fell into a hallucination, the people in front of her suddenly turned into Japanese officers and soldiers, shouting a Japanese name repeatedly. Then, in front of [Liu Hemei], there appeared many men and women from different eras.
0:4:8|0:4:22|Everyone stared at him intently and approached step by step. In a daze, [Liu Hemei] hurriedly fled to a dim corridor in the illusion, accidentally falling to the ground. Upon getting up, he found everything around him starting to spin.
0:4:22|0:4:32|The scene returns to the real world, where [Liu Hemei] is rushed to the hospital for treatment. The [doctor] conducts an examination on him. In the hospital room, [Liu Hemei] wakes up, struggling, with a complex device on his head.
0:5:23|0:5:38|Liu Hemei gradually settled down, lying on the hospital bed with his eyes closed. The female doctor gently stroked his graying hair. Comforted by the doctor, Liu Hemei murmured softly and fell into a deep sleep. It turned out that the old man's name was Kazumi Akiyama.
0:5:38|0:5:45|The female doctor looked at the old man, then turned to the computer screen after confirming he was asleep. The screen displayed the structure of the old man's brain.
0:5:46|0:5:57|The female doctor seemed to have noticed something unusual, as if a wave of electricity was flowing, extracting memories from the old man, transporting them back to the era of the fierce fighting between the Qinghua and Japanese armies.
0:5:57|0:6:17|The young [Liu Hemei] dressed in a sharp suit, walked through a courtyard adorned with various flags, strode into a magnificent building, and was greeted by a gorgeously dressed Western woman. She shook hands with [Liu Hemei] and then led her to a well-dressed white man, who handed [Liu Hemei] a glass of wine.
0:6:17|0:6:29|He started a friendly conversation with her. The Caucasian man learned that [Liu Hemei] was a special invited journalist from three Western news agencies, so he asked [Liu Hemei] about her views on the performance of the Japanese army during the Sino-Japanese War.
0:6:37|0:6:53|Western armies from various countries are plundering treasures from the Forbidden City. These bronzes and porcelain items taken from the Forbidden City are still displayed in museums around the world. Even France, the aggressor, is no exception. In contrast, the Japanese army at the time was guarding the gates of the Forbidden City.
0:6:53|0:6:59|Although not everyone is virtuous, the overall discipline of the entire Japanese army remains well-behaved.
0:7:17|0:7:23|At this moment, another Western man hurriedly ran down from upstairs to inform everyone that an important broadcast needed to be listened to.
0:7:39|0:7:47|In the scene, Japanese invaders bury innocent Chinese civilians alive, with bodies littering the streets. [Kazumi Akiyama] looks solemn after listening to the broadcast.
0:7:47|0:7:58|Shortly after, [Kazumi Akiyama] sat in the car, anxiously preparing to go home. Unexpectedly, in a small alley, several uninvited guests suddenly rushed to the front of the car and shot at [Kazumi Akiyama]. The driver knocked one of them down to the ground.
0:8:0|0:8:15|At this moment, a man in a suit rushed over, pulled out a gun, and engaged in a battle with the gangsters. Nearby Japanese soldiers heard the gunshots and quickly arrived. The man in the suit ran towards the Japanese soldiers who came to support after finding out that his bullets had run out.
0:8:23|0:8:28|Later, Xizhuang Nan returned to the Japanese military headquarters and reported the street gunfight to his superior.
0:8:42|0:8:53|Originally, [Kazumi Akiyama] is a well-known journalist in the West, her power alone is equivalent to an army. Japan needs [Kazumi Akiyama] to give them positive coverage internationally in order to maintain Japan's image.
0:8:57|0:9:13|The man in a suit then drove to the home of [Liu Hemei], who lived in a two-story European-style villa, with several Japanese soldiers standing guard at the door. Upon learning that the man in the suit was named Nakamura, [Liu Hemei] couldn't help but smile with joy, and the two sat chatting at the terrace table.
0:9:21|0:9:29|[Liu Hemei] lowered her head and smiled shyly upon hearing it, showing a hint of modesty as she humbly thanked Nakamura.
0:9:45|0:9:49|Hemei was surprised to find that Nakamura shared the same opinion as her.
0:10:15|0:10:30|The scene shifts, a truck full of young girls enters the camp, which is a comfort station established by the Japanese army. A charming female administrator in a kimono is issuing tickets to the soldiers, with [Liu Hemei] also hiding among the Japanese soldiers in the queue.
0:10:31|0:10:34|The female administrator did not realize that [Liu Hemei] is a woman.
0:10:38|0:10:48|[Liu Hemei] pushed the door open and walked into the room, only to see a North Korean woman lying on the bed wrapped in a blanket. The North Korean woman had her back to [Liu Hemei] and didn't even turn to look.
0:10:55|0:11:1|The North Korean woman turned back to take a look, only to be surprised to find that [Liu Hemei] was actually a woman.
0:11:2|0:11:7|Instinctively covering her chest and shrinking at the head of the bed, with tear marks on her face and trembling lips.
0:11:34|0:11:46|Liu Hemei was deeply shocked. Although she was Japanese, as a woman, she could not tolerate any woman from any nation being bullied and oppressed like this.
0:11:54|0:12:6|At this moment, a woman in a cheongsam with her hair coiled up was about to enter the room. After hearing the conversation between the father and daughter, she quietly retreated. Although Liu Hemei's father was on good terms with the commander, he advised Liu Hemei not to submit this report.
0:12:36|0:12:47|The scene shifts, at night, in a luxurious room, a Japanese general is playfully wrestling with [Kazumi Akiyama], the female administrator, who is lying coquettishly in the general's arms.
0:13:0|0:13:4|General Liu Hemei, upon hearing this, flew into a rage and slapped her, knocking her to the ground.
0:13:10|0:13:28|The female administrator picked up her clothes in panic and left. When it was daylight, the scene shifted to a gray-red church. The cheongsam-wearing woman who had been eavesdropping in [Liu Hemei]'s house was also sitting in a seat in the church. At that moment, three men disguised as special agents walked into the prayer hall and casually sat near the cheongsam-wearing woman.
0:13:28|0:13:44|The woman in cheongsam secretly slipped a letter into the sleeve of the man next to her. As the man stood up, three agents immediately pulled out their guns to stop him. At that moment, some of the man's accomplices emerged from behind the church and started shooting at the three agents, while [Kazumi Akiyama] rode home in a car as usual.
0:13:44|0:13:49|The driver parked the car at the entrance and kindly got out to open the door for [Kazumi Akiyama].
0:13:49|0:14:4|[Kazumi Akiyama] walked into the room with her hands in her pockets, only to be taken aback by the sight inside. The living room was lit up, but it was in a mess as if it had experienced a fierce fight. Books were scattered all over the floor, and to her horror, her parents were lying in a pool of blood.
0:14:4|0:14:20|[Kazumi Akiyama] stood at the doorway, leaning against the door frame, her legs seeming a bit unsteady. She slowly moved into the room, leaning on the cabinet, and knelt in front of her parents. She shook her parents' arms, crying out "Mom, Dad," but there was no response from them.
0:14:33|0:14:41|[Kazumi Akiyama] stood up and found her father holding a letter. She trembled as she opened it, only to discover that it was her father's farewell letter to her.
0:14:57|0:15:13|Before his death, the father entrusted [Liu Hemei] and the mother to himself. In the letter, he warned [Liu Hemei] that she was in danger and needed to leave quickly. Overwhelmed by the sudden loss of both parents and the change in her identity, [Liu Hemei] held the letter tightly to her chest, crying uncontrollably.
0:15:14|0:15:29|That night, a Japanese military unit arrived at the home of [Liu Hemei]. Startled awake while sleeping on the sofa, [Liu Hemei] saw it was Nakamura at the door. Nakamura pulled [Liu Hemei] into the house. Overwhelmed with grief, [Liu Hemei] could no longer contain her emotions and started crying in Nakamura's arms.
0:15:29|0:15:34|At this moment, Nakamura heard the sound of a car outside the room and realized that Japanese soldiers were catching up.
0:15:39|0:15:56|Nakamura led [Kazumi Akiyama] to the outside of the house. After confirming that they were not discovered, the two carefully bent down along the railing and quickly crossed the open balcony. The next moment, the Japanese soldiers downstairs followed in a car, they crouched and moved forward along the edge of the woods.
0:15:56|0:16:7|Nakamura decisively led [Kazumi Akiyama] to climb over the fence. The Japanese soldiers found that [Kazumi Akiyama] had escaped and immediately turned around to chase. At this moment, [Kazumi Akiyama] ran onto a small road, where several Chinese people came to help.
0:16:13|0:16:25|The Japanese military vehicle drove through the jungle, relentlessly pursuing. [Nakamura] led [Kazumi Akiyama] to the office of the Chinese underground party. The intelligence officer came to report to the leader, who warmly welcomed the two.
0:17:19|0:17:27|The sound of gunfire and explosions from the Japanese invaders completely shattered everything. After the capture of Nanjing and Shanghai,
0:17:31|0:17:35|Countless common people,
0:17:44|0:18:0|The camera moves to the shining sun in Yangon, Myanmar, where temples are everywhere and millions of pagodas stand in the wilderness. The local people lead a peaceful life, with rickshaw drivers shuttling on the streets and small vendors enthusiastically promoting their goods to passersby.
0:18:0|0:18:11|[Kazumi Akiyama] and [Huang Ziqian] arrived at a temple in the back of a car, walking side by side on a path next to the temple. The sound of wind chimes and chanting filled the air, creating an atmosphere of peace and tranquility everywhere.
0:18:18|0:18:35|[Huang Ziqian] took a few steps forward, bent down to pick up a tuning fork. He looked back at [Liu Hemei], the two exchanged a smile, then he turned the tuning fork and raised his hand to strike down.
0:18:37|0:18:50|[Liu Hemei] looked up, at this moment, the sunlight shining on her cheeks, the breeze blowing through her hair, a smile appearing on her face after a long absence. On May 10th, the two returned to the inn, and [Ziqian] handed a clean towel to [Liu Hemei].
0:18:50|0:18:59|[Liu Hemei] is wearing a silk nightgown, standing next to [Ziqian], taking a towel to gently wipe her face. [Ziqian] notices [Liu Hemei]'s awkward outfit and sees her avoiding eye contact.
0:19:5|0:19:20|[Ziqian] finished speaking and then left the room. She closed the door, stood at the doorway taking a deep breath to calm her restless heart, and then, after calming down, rolled up her sleeves, turned around, and went to wash up.
0:19:21|0:19:31|In the room, [Liu Hemei] also lifted the blanket and prepared to lie down to sleep. Shortly after, [Huang Ziqian] returned from washing up and was about to knock on the door, but hesitated to disturb [Liu Hemei] sleeping, so he quietly pushed the door open.
0:19:33|0:19:51|He saw [Liu Hemei] sleeping alone on one side of the bed, motionless. After a few seconds of contemplation, Kazumi Akiyama looked around and saw the very simple furnishings in the room, with only a wardrobe and a dressing table. She could only sleep on the recliner, so she covered herself with her suit jacket and prepared to sleep.
0:19:51|0:19:58|At this moment, [Liu Hemei] slowly opened her eyes and realized that Ziqian had not gone to bed to tell her.
0:20:2|0:20:17|Ziqian later fell asleep on the other side of the bed. In her dream, [Kazumi Akiyama] dreamed again of the words her father had admonished her with that day, if she hadn't insisted on writing the report about Wei Anfu. Perhaps things wouldn't have ended up as they did today, with her family destroyed and her wandering homeless.
0:20:17|0:20:28|In her dream, Liu Hemei saw her father dying tragically in front of her, tears streaming down her face. Upon hearing Hemei's cries, Ziqian immediately turned around, hesitated for a few seconds, then turned back to embrace Hemei.
0:20:33|0:20:36|Four years later, one day, [Liu Hemei] brought her daughter to the church to pray.
0:21:8|0:21:13|Liu Hemei and her daughter were stopped by a mysterious old man wearing a hat as soon as they walked out the door.
0:21:19|0:21:22|The old man handed a jade pendant to Liu Hemei.
0:21:29|0:21:50|Kazumi Akiyama picked up the fallen clothes, gently stroking them with her fingers, a look of confusion on her face. Holding her daughter's hand, she walked out of the temple, the bustling street filled with people and the clear sound of car bells echoing in the street. Her daughter took small steps, opening her arms to chase after her mother, and the mother and daughter played and frolicked all the way.
0:21:50|0:21:52|Back home, Liu Hemei's daughter started singing nursery rhymes in the courtyard.
0:22:29|0:22:36|In the sound of gunfire, [Huang Ziqian] watches the people fleeing in the chaotic streets and hurries home to look for his daughter and [Liu Hemei].
0:22:51|0:23:1|War is approaching, and in order to escape the conflict, the civilians in Myanmar are carrying their belongings and leading their livestock, desperately running along the mountain road. In the rush, [Kazumi Akiyama] almost stumbled, a hunting maid.
0:23:6|0:23:28|A group of people had just escaped to a suspension bridge when Japanese planes were already approaching. The sky was filled with smoke, and countless bombs were falling like raindrops into the lake, creating huge waves. Explosions and cries for help intertwined as gunfire filled the sky. In the midst of the crisis, Liu Hemei got separated from her daughter.
0:23:28|0:23:35|A shell landed on the suspension bridge, blowing the bridge deck to pieces. Back to the present, [Liu Hemei] woke up in the hospital bed.
0:23:44|0:23:56|Kazumi Akiyama anxiously reached out with both hands, as if trying to grasp something. The female doctor ran out of the ward, closed her eyes and leaned against the wall, shaking her head. Her boyfriend, noticing her unusual expression, was very worried about her condition.
0:23:59|0:24:18|The female doctor held her head, and her boyfriend quickly stepped forward to support her. The female doctor's name is [Zhang Min], and she was seen leaning against the wall, stumbling forward in a daze. At this moment, her legs went weak, swaying unsteadily. [Zhang Min] felt dizzy and her mind was in a state of confusion.
0:24:23|0:24:42|[Zhang Min] returned home, the walls of the house were covered with information about Wei Anfu. He stood by the wall, staring intently at a photo of [Liu Hemei], pondering something in his mind. Seeing [Zhang Min] still lost in thought staring at the photo, his boyfriend brought two glasses of water from the kitchen.
0:24:42|0:24:46|Approaching [Zhang Min], Liu Hemei asked with concern.
0:25:21|0:25:24|So we invited him to come for an interview.
0:26:22|0:26:30|He is a security guard, the scene shifts to the hospital room, [Zhang Min] holds [Kazumi Akiyama]'s hand.
0:26:42|0:26:45|[Kazumi Akiyama] pointed to her own head.
0:27:13|0:27:17|[Zhang Min] took off the stethoscope and looked at [Kazumi Akiyama] with a sad expression, asking with concern.
0:27:38|0:27:42|He patted Liu Hemei's shoulder tenderly, and Hemei closed her eyes.
0:27:48|0:28:6|[Zhang Min] bent down, and [Liu Hemei] saw that her necklace seemed familiar. She realized it was the jade pendant that the mysterious old man had taught her in front of the church years ago.
0:28:45|0:28:55|[Zhang Min] held the jade pendant in front of her chest, glanced back at [Liu Hemei], and walked out of the ward thoughtfully. Hemei lay on the bed, unable to believe the incredible coincidence in the world.
0:29:22|0:29:31|The camera cuts to [Huang Xiaoli], now a middle-aged woman in professional attire, carrying a handbag as she enters a spacious Chinese-style office.
0:29:32|0:29:36|She answered the phone, it was her daughter [Zhang Min] calling from China.
0:30:59|0:31:12|In a Red Cross office overseas, the skilled and experienced [Huang Ziqian] hung his head in disappointment as he listened to the staff telling him that the Red Cross had been helping to search for his wife, [Liu Hemei].
0:31:12|0:31:24|However, after so many years have passed, the relevant documents have long been buried, but there is still no news of the whereabouts of [Liu Hemei]. The Red Cross also cannot confirm whether his wife is still in this world, they have done their best.
0:31:25|0:31:46|Ziqian listened in silence, knowing that she might never see Liu Hemei again in her lifetime, but still holding onto a glimmer of hope. At that moment, Xiaoli hurried over and excitedly told her father. Ziqian was thrilled, raising her right hand to her chest in a cross gesture, devoutly praying to God above.
0:31:50|0:32:6|[Huang Ziqian] told the staff that they had hope of finding his wife, so he and his daughter happily left the Red Cross. In order to see his mother and wife as soon as possible, the two of them took a plane overnight and hurried to Nanjing.
0:32:6|0:32:19|As soon as Liu Hemei's front foot landed, her back foot eagerly followed her daughter Zhang Min and boyfriend to drive to the hospital. Just as Ziqian was about to enter the hospital, Zhang Min came over to tell him, and the group went outside the hospital building to look for Kazumi Akiyama.
0:32:33|0:32:51|Ming Min pointed forward with her finger, only to see [Liu Hemei] and a nurse sitting by the small bridge in the hospital. They couldn't believe that Kazumi Akiyama, who had been missing for years, was now right in front of them. Several people walked up to Kazumi, who was being stingy, unaware of anyone approaching, and still sunbathing with her eyes closed.
0:32:51|0:33:2|Ming Min walked up to Kazumi Akiyama and called out to her softly. Akiyama didn't react at all, only vaguely hearing her humming something under her breath.
0:33:2|0:33:15|[Huang Xiaoli] couldn't believe her eyes when she saw Kazumi's awkward appearance. It was only then that Yoshito realized the nursery rhyme Kazumi was humming was the same one her daughter Lily used to sing in Myanmar, "The Scholar".
0:33:15|0:33:29|[Huang Xiaoli] looked at his long-lost wife in front of him, his eyes already red, recalling the appearance of Kazumi when she was young. That year, Kazumi, who was planting the beans of youth, was still a good reputation, a girl with a smiling face like a flower.
0:33:29|0:33:37|And now, the woman in front of us has become an elderly person weathered by the years, with deep wrinkles on her cheeks, and her once bright eyes have also become cloudy.
0:33:53|0:34:9|A tear fell from [Kazumi Akiyama]'s cheek, the wrinkles on her face seemed to record all the hardships she had endured over the years. [Zhang Min] sat beside [Kazumi Akiyama], tears streaming down her face, one hand resting on her knee, singing a folk song together.
0:34:9|0:34:18|Ziqian raised her hand and gently stroked the diseased hair of [Kazumi Akiyama], patiently counting each disobedient strand behind her ear.
0:34:35|0:34:46|Upon hearing his wife calling his name, [Huang Ziqian] trembled and asked, while [Huang Xiaoli] and Zhang Mingming excitedly ran forward to support [Kazumi Akiyama] on both sides.
0:35:19|0:35:29|The reunited family embraced tightly, and at that moment, [Huang Ziqian] slowly stood up, gently patting the mother and daughter who were embracing each other, his voice trembling as he spoke.
0:35:56|0:36:22|Anmei, Liu Hemei and Huang Ziqian looked at the mother and daughter who were still embracing, unable to bear to separate them, so she reluctantly turned and walked away. Kazumi Akiyama raised her head, watching Huang Ziqian's figure moving away, memories flashing before her eyes. She recalled the bits and pieces of the past, remembering the scene when Huang Ziqian first saved her on the street that year.
0:36:22|0:36:42|Thinking of Ziqian coming home, the two of them discussed the article on the balcony. At that moment, their hearts and souls were connected. Remembering their passionate love in Myanmar, embracing, holding hands, strolling the streets in a foreign land, creating the fruit of love, and all the beautiful moments with him.
0:36:42|0:36:47|[Kazumi Akiyama] stared intently at the departing Ziqian, afraid that she would once again slip away from her sight.
0:36:48|0:37:3|The look in Liu Hemei's eyes is full of longing and nostalgia for Huang Ziqian over the years. Their wish has finally come true after enduring the test of time. Fortunately, the two are able to reunite in their twilight years and accompany each other in old age.
0:37:3|0:37:15|[Huang Ziqian] stood at the edge of the bridge, hands resting on the railing, while [Liu Hemei] bent over, hands hanging low, slowly approaching [Huang Ziqian]. Due to the years of abuse her body had endured and her advanced age, [Liu Hemei] walked very slowly.
0:37:16|0:37:27|He walked unsteadily but still resolutely. [Zhang Min] tried to step forward to help his grandmother, but was stopped by his mother. [Huang Ziqian] looked up at his wife walking towards him with difficulty, feeling a lump in his throat.
0:37:27|0:37:38|At this moment, the distance between Kazumi Akiyama and [Huang Ziqian] was only a short ten meters, but it took them decades to walk these ten meters, bringing time back to the day they got lost during the war.
0:37:44|0:38:1|The falling shell destroyed the suspension bridge, leaving [Huang Xiaoli] separated from her parents. She went through life and death alone, crying with no one to respond. Her small body was covered in blood, her clothes tattered. She walked lonely on the rugged path, her cries echoing in the horrifying ruins.
0:38:2|0:38:19|The surrounding scene of devastation is filled with endless wailing, as the Japanese soldiers press on the captured civilians. Among them is [Huang Xiaoli], who follows the crowd in a state of panic and confusion, walking aimlessly. As the soldiers pass by her, [Huang Xiaoli] appears even more frail and small in the reflection.
0:38:26|0:38:45|Lily walked under a broken roof and was suddenly picked up by someone, who turned out to be her father, [Huang Ziqian]. [Huang Ziqian] smiled and embraced the crying Lily in his arms, and the father and daughter were finally reunited.
0:38:45|0:38:55|Myanmar has temporarily returned to calm, and the streets are bustling again. He held Lily and followed a monk, who led them to a shelter and introduced them to the female host here.
0:39:29|0:39:52|Lily saw [Huang Ziqian] had a scarf in his pocket. [Huang Ziqian] took out the scarf from his pocket, looked at it, and handed it to Lily. The scene shifted to a waterfall in a mountain forest, with water flowing down the cliff. [Huang Ziqian] clumsily walked across a single-log bridge over a stream in the mountain.
0:39:52|0:40:10|She looked up and gazed around, only to see tall trees and scattered rocks. Kazumi Akiyama ventured through the jungle, crossing mountains and rivers, even almost falling into the swift river. She searched everywhere for Liu Hemei's figure, and finally stood weakly by the stream, shouting loudly.
0:40:33|0:40:45|The Burmese sisters found the fox [Kazumi Akiyama] and brought it back to their home. [Kazumi Akiyama] was lying weakly on the bed with herbs on its back.
0:40:48|0:41:9|[Kazumi Akiyama] slowly opened her eyes. On the other side, [Huang Xiaoli] ran into a temple, looked up at the Buddha, and covered her eyes. Then she arrived at the edge of the alley, tiptoed and reached out to grab the offering bottle on the table. However, due to her short stature, she accidentally knocked over the offering bottle onto the ground.
0:41:9|0:41:15|The abbot heard a voice, walked out from behind the Buddha statue, and saw Xiaoli. He asked her:
0:41:24|0:41:44|Li Li carried a bowl of medicine, her small body struggling to climb the steep wooden steps of the shelter, and handed the medicine to the ailing Ziqian lying on the ground. Ziqian opened her eyes and looked at the little Liu Hemei kneeling in front of her, holding up the medicine. A tired smile appeared on her weary face as she embraced Liu Hemei.
0:41:44|0:41:46|[Liu Hemei] gently touched Ziqian's forehead with her small hand.
0:41:55|0:42:12|Lily pushed Ziqian's hand towards her mouth, indicating for her to take the medicine. Ziqian smiled at Lily. At night, in the village where [Kazumi Akiyama] lived, the local people were dancing around a bonfire. The recovering patient, [Liu Hemei], stood outside the room, watching the people downstairs singing and dancing.
0:42:12|0:42:20|Unexpectedly, at this moment, a group of Japanese soldiers were ambushing behind the trees in the jungle next to the bonfire, holding guns and aiming at the dancing civilians ahead.
0:42:21|0:42:38|Upstairs, [Liu Hemei] was startled and quickly grabbed her sister to escape. The people who were dancing just a second ago were now lying in pools of blood, surrounded by Japanese soldiers. They captured [Kazumi Akiyama] and her sister. A soldier looked at [Liu Hemei], feeling a sense of familiarity, squinting his eyes to examine her closely.
0:42:39|0:42:50|He recognized that [Liu Hemei] was the female journalist who reported on Wei Anfu back then. The soldier took [Liu Hemei] back to the military camp, where a Japanese officer was practicing with a samurai sword in the room, swinging it forcefully against the wall time and time again.
0:42:55|0:42:58|The soldier pulled [Liu Hemei] over and said happily.
0:43:0|0:43:6|The officer turned around and saw [Liu Hemei], walking up to her and scrutinizing her, questioning if she was the journalist Kazumi Akiyama from years ago.
0:43:12|0:43:15|The officer viciously grabbed [Liu Hemei]'s chin with his hand.
0:43:21|0:43:25|Hemei fearlessly and confidently tells the Japanese officer.
0:43:29|0:43:34|The officer slapped [Liu Hemei], knocking her to the ground. [Liu Hemei] struggled to stand up.
0:43:58|0:44:0|Liu Hemei choked up and said.
0:44:11|0:44:17|Since Liu Hemei is so interested in Wei Anfu, let her have a chance and let Liu Hemei go.
0:44:29|0:44:44|And this scene is exactly what [Liu Hemei] recalled when she saw the statue in the memorial hall. She struggled, but was still dragged away by the soldier. Several trucks filled with girls from various countries moved forward in the middle of the night, and the Japanese army sent them all to comfort stations.
0:44:46|0:45:3|A group of soldiers surrounded the truck, dragging the girls off and roughly herding them into the yard. The first thing they were urged to do upon arrival was to register at two small wooden tables. During the day, several more trucks drove in, with Kazumi Akiyama and her sister among them.
0:45:4|0:45:20|Surrounded by soldiers holding guns, the entire courtyard of the comfort station was encircled. The female manager stared at them intently, afraid that they might escape if she let her guard down. Liu Hemei was forced to change into a kimono and, under the watchful eyes of two managers, entered the line where names were being registered.
0:45:20|0:45:27|They were lined up in four rows, listening to the instructions of the Japanese officer on stage. The Japanese officer paced back and forth on the stage with his hands behind his back.
0:45:28|0:45:37|Soldiers surrounded the comfort women group below, and the girls lowered their heads one by one, afraid to look at the officers in front of them. The officer spoke to the captured girls below.
0:45:50|0:45:54|The girls in the audience were frightened by the gunshots, each one trembling with fear.
0:45:58|0:46:16|Two administrators of the comfort station walked in front of the comfort women, all wearing wooden clogs, and under the guard of soldiers, led the comfort women to their respective rooms. In a small wooden house, [Kazumi Akiyama] sat on the bed in fear, while a soldier looked her up and down with malicious intent.
0:46:20|0:46:29|The soldier angrily slapped Liu Hemei, knocking her down on the bed, then stripped off her clothes and subjected Kazumi Akiyama to brutal and inhuman beatings and humiliation.
0:46:29|0:46:45|Another group of soldiers lined up and entered the comfort station under the lead of an officer. They stopped in the middle of the courtyard, and the leading officer instructed the soldiers that each person had 15 minutes to spend with the comfort women. It was emphasized that safety measures must be taken to ensure their physical health.
0:46:46|0:47:3|Two administrators were distributing tickets to the soldiers, warmly welcoming them. [Kazumi Akiyama] looked on in despair. All the comfort women stood at the door of each wooden house, waiting for the soldiers to enter. The soldiers holding the big tickets joyfully chose a comfort woman and dragged her into the room.
0:47:5|0:47:23|In one of the wooden cabins, a young girl with short hair sat on the bed, looking terrified at the soldier in front of her who was unbuttoning his shirt. Tears of helplessness streamed down the girl's face as she tried to escape, only to be slapped down by the soldier. He then pinned the girl down on the bed.
0:47:24|0:47:42|The girl bit a soldier's arm and took the opportunity to escape from the room. The female administrator saw her and quickly stopped her. The little girl broke free from the female administrator and continued to run forward. Unexpectedly, she encountered a patrolling officer. The officer didn't hesitate to shoot and kill the little girl. It was already countless nights like this.
0:47:43|0:48:2|In this scene, trucks are coming in one after another to the comfort station. Soldiers on the watchtower watch as the trucks come and go. During the day, waves of soldiers drag comfort women into small wooden houses. They treat these women as tools for their own sexual desires, taking turns to abuse them without any chance to catch their breath.
0:48:3|0:48:23|Comfort women endure inhuman torture day after day. This earthly purgatory is a living hell for them, a nightmare for countless young girls. The male administrator of the comfort station quietly enters a small wooden house. The comfort woman covers her naked body with a blanket, shrinking back in fear.
0:48:23|0:48:39|The male administrator takes off his clothes and leeringly demands the comfort women to satisfy him. The war is still ongoing, with planes circling overhead, gunfire roaring, and the land in ruins. After the frontline soldiers finish fighting, they will queue up to seek solace at the comfort station.
0:48:39|0:48:58|One morning, Japanese soldiers brought a group of naive and innocent young girls to the comfort station. The comfort women watched behind the wire as the Burmese sister who was captured with [Liu Hemei] recognized her own sister among the group of young girls, whose name was Nana.
0:49:0|0:49:7|[Kazumi Akiyama] and her sister grabbed the wire mesh fence with their hands, running alongside the little girl and shouting at the soldiers to let go of her sister.
0:49:8|0:49:20|These little girls were pulled onto the truck by the soldiers one by one, not knowing where they would be taken. [Kazumi Akiyama] and her sister cried out, but could only watch helplessly as Nana and the other girls were taken away.
0:49:34|0:49:53|That day, after a soldier took away [Liu Hemei] and put on his clothes, he turned around to leave. [Liu Hemei] sat on the bed crying helplessly. The next moment, another soldier approached, [Liu Hemei] looked at him with tear-streaked face, shaking her head pleading for mercy. The soldier turned a blind eye, took off his clothes, and continued his brutality.
0:49:53|0:49:58|Elder sister [Huang Xiaoli] staggered into the room of [Kazumi Akiyama], who closed the door and helped her onto the bed.
0:50:1|0:50:7|The older sister suddenly knelt down in front of [Kazumi Akiyama].
0:50:57|0:51:12|At this moment, the sound of dinner being served came from outside the door. In order not to be discovered by others, [Kazumi Akiyama] quickly pulled her sister, who was kneeling on the ground, and sent her out the door. The sister kept struggling, so [Kazumi Akiyama] had to ruthlessly close the door. Leaning against the door, [Kazumi Akiyama] stared at the tears in her eyes.
0:51:12|0:51:23|All comfort women were called to the door, standing by the corridor. Several comfort women knelt in a row in the courtyard, with two comfort station administrators standing behind them, bowing their heads in shame.
0:51:27|0:51:45|The comfort woman kneeling on the ground died a tragic death in the courtyard, leaving everyone trembling with fear. The officer warned them that if they tried to escape, they would be shot on the spot just like these comfort women. The officer called the two managers forward, and they knelt down in fear. The officer pointed a gun at the male manager's head and scolded him angrily.
0:51:49|0:51:59|Late at night, another group of soldiers arrived at the comfort station by car. Under the command of the officer, two administrators sat at a small wooden table warmly welcoming them, issuing receipts to the soldiers overnight.
0:52:2|0:52:17|In Kazumi Akiyama's room, a soldier refuses to take safety measures, and Kazumi Akiyama fiercely resists. Liu Hemei hears their argument and rushes to the window to listen. Kazumi Akiyama forcefully pushes the soldier into the corner of the wall, naked, and takes the opportunity to run out of the room.
0:52:17|0:52:23|She ran barefoot, step by step, on the bumpy mountain path full of gravel and rocks.
0:52:24|0:52:39|Tears streamed down her face, but she still furrowed her brow and ran resolutely towards a well. [Kazumi Akiyama] watched her sister running from the window, but couldn't go out to stop her. Despite being naked, her steps never faltered.
0:52:39|0:52:47|She ran to the edge of the well, with disheveled hair, a look of extreme pain on her face, emitting rapid gasps, her hair strands mixed with tears sticking to her cheeks.
0:52:48|0:53:6|The older sister sobbed, looking at her reflection in the well water. She turned to [Liu Hemei] by the window, tears covering her face but a hint of relief in her smile. Her eyes seemed to tell [Liu Hemei] that she was finally going to be free, no longer having to endure all the filth here.
0:53:7|0:53:24|She closed her eyes, turned her head in despair, no longer willing to look at the world, and then jumped into the well without hesitation. A life passed in an instant, and her sister never got the chance to escape. [Liu Hemei] witnessed everything that had just happened, crying uncontrollably by the window.
0:53:24|0:53:27|After daybreak, [Liu Hemei] started writing in her diary.
0:53:54|0:54:8|The scene shifts to a terrace, which is the command post of the Japanese army. Several soldiers are standing guard at the railing, with a map hanging on the wall. In the center of the terrace, there is a large table, and four Japanese officers are sitting beside it.
0:54:53|0:55:4|The soldiers who have retreated from the front lines are taking a train back to Myanmar. Trucks are transporting them to the comfort station, where they line up at the entrance as if celebrating a victory.
0:55:12|0:55:30|[Kazumi Akiyama] looked on with concern at the soldiers. A soldier emerged from the wooden house, wearing a coat in disarray. Inside the house, a girl in a white bra hastily pulled up her pants, dragging her tired body to the door and closing it. Unexpectedly, the male administrator pushed the door open the next moment.
0:55:39|0:55:45|The girl's mouth was already oozing blood, she looked at the officer in front of her adjusting his belt, another round of brutal humiliation.
0:55:56|0:56:12|She was covered in bruises, sitting at the bedside with her knees hugged, eyes full of hatred, breathing heavily in anger. [Liu Hemei] entered her room, the girl sat on the edge of the bed, holding her right arm with her left hand, eyes empty, her two braids on top of her head already undone.
0:56:12|0:56:19|[Liu Hemei] washed the handkerchief clean, wiping away the scars for her while comforting her.
0:56:43|0:56:57|The girl widened her eyes in disbelief as she heard Kazumi Akiyama say to escape. In a Japanese military field hospital, injured Japanese soldiers lay on the ground. The officer spoke to the two soldiers behind him.
0:56:57|0:57:11|Recently, the Japanese army has been continuously attacked by the United States, with heavy casualties and losses, and their combat effectiveness is declining. Not only that, the war in China has also reached a decisive stage. He sighed.
0:57:16|0:57:33|Therefore, it was requested to quickly send the comfort women to the front lines. That night, in the comfort station, a group of soldiers led by an officer arrived in the courtyard, surrounded by silence. He blew a whistle, and the comfort women instantly woke up, hastily putting on their clothes and gathering in the courtyard.
0:57:33|0:57:50|The two administrators hurriedly ran to the officer before they could put on their coats. They instructed the comfort women to line up, and the officer handed a piece of paper to the administrators, telling them that the front line needed five comfort women each from Japan, China, and Korea, and asked them to gather the women as soon as possible.
0:57:50|0:58:0|The administrator approached the comfort women, selecting them one by one from the line. [Kazumi Akiyama] exchanged a glance with a few of the comfort women, and they all lowered their heads, silently understanding each other.
0:58:5|0:58:15|The selected comfort women were taken away by the soldiers, and the manager bowed obsequiously to the officer behind the soldiers, respectfully escorting them out of the comfort station.
0:58:15|0:58:27|At night, the comfort station returned to tranquility. Back in the room, the girl with braided hair secretly opened the door and peeked out. After confirming that there was no one around, she called out to her companions, and several of them tiptoed out.
0:58:41|0:59:3|They called [Liu Hemei] and ran out of the comfort station together. Unfortunately, the soldiers on the guard tower spotted them and sounded the alarm. In an instant, the alarm bell rang loudly, and the comfort women, holding up their skirts, ran frantically forward. The soldiers mobilized collectively, carrying guns, chasing after them from behind.
0:59:3|0:59:7|The male administrators struggled, without much thought, they could only endure the pain and drill out of the iron chain, running towards the depths of the jungle, with soldiers closely chasing after them.
0:59:25|0:59:41|When they passed through the jungle, ahead was unexpectedly a wide beach with no place to hide. The Japanese soldiers behind quickly caught up, raised their guns, and aimed at the comfort women still running ahead. The officer pulled the trigger, and [Kazumi Akiyama] shouted at the braided girl.
0:59:52|1:0:1|The girl with braided hair named Xiu Hua stopped, looked back at [Liu Hemei] with a hint of reluctance in her eyes, then turned and continued running forward.
1:0:5|1:0:22|With a few gunshots, everything disappeared into the darkness. At night, a Japanese officer led a group of soldiers to the comfort station to give them a pep talk. He told the soldiers that they would soon be heading to the battlefield. Then, the officer patted a young soldier on the shoulder and told them not to be afraid.
1:0:26|1:0:41|After the call, Soldier Liu Hemei accidentally ran into the room of the female administrator. He saw her dressing up, quickly apologized and turned to leave. However, the female administrator stopped him and he closed the door and walked over to her.
1:0:41|1:0:46|The female administrator touched the young soldier's face, praised him for being handsome, and asked if it was his first time at the comfort station.
1:0:47|1:1:1|The young soldier nodded, and the female administrator then asked if he was going to the battlefield tomorrow. The soldier nodded again, and the female administrator said she was willing to serve him tonight, even if he died in battle, it would be an honor.
1:1:1|1:1:18|After a brief flirtation, the female administrator praised the young soldier for his luck, as she never receives soldiers. She asked the young soldier how old he was, and he replied that he was only 16 years old. The female administrator recognized his accent as Fukuoka, but he claimed to be from Saho. This surprised the female administrator.
1:1:18|1:1:36|Because she knew that these soldiers all came from Kyushu, but the young soldier was very certain that he was from Saho. The female administrator thought of something, a hint of panic flashed across her face. She asked for the name of the young soldier, who straightened his clothes and happily said his name was [Arai Taro].
1:1:36|1:1:41|The female administrator was shocked in an instant, and she confirmed with the young soldier again.
1:1:49|1:2:1|The female administrator walked inexplicably to the young soldier's front. She looked at the young soldier in front of her, a tear rolled down her cheek, trembling as she asked the young soldier to look at her carefully, and asked if he still recognized her.
1:2:50|1:2:58|Taro realized that he had just done something against human ethics with [Kazumi Akiyama], and collapsed to the ground in despair.
1:3:9|1:3:29|Meizi also pounded her chest in grief, as Taro shouted and rushed out the door. He pushed past the soldiers guarding the entrance, accidentally falling to the ground, then quickly got up and stumbled towards the outside of the security office. Meizi, wearing pajamas, chased after Taro from behind.
1:3:35|1:3:41|A group of soldiers quickly surrounded Taro, aiming their guns at him and ordering him to put down his weapon.
1:3:44|1:3:52|At this moment, the officer shouted for his assistant, who walked slowly from behind. He waved his hand, signaling the soldiers to lower their guns.
1:3:53|1:3:58|Taro still aimed his gun at the officer. At this moment, Meizi also hurried over.
1:4:16|1:4:20|Comfort women were awakened and stood outside the railing watching the battle.
1:4:26|1:4:38|Meizi hurried forward and ran to her younger brother's side. Taro shook his head, Meizi knelt on the ground, pleading with Taro. Taro, in despair, dropped the gun in his hand and knelt in front of his sister.
1:4:46|1:5:0|The siblings knelt on the ground, embracing each other and crying in pain once again. On the other side, [Kazumi Akiyama] outside the railing was moved to tears by the deep affection between the siblings. Meizi held her brother in her arms with one hand, while her brother lay on her shoulder wailing loudly.
1:5:4|1:5:15|While her other hand slowly pulled out a hand grenade from her pocket, [Liu Hemei] wrapped her arms around Taro and said no more. The next moment, [Liu Hemei] pulled the pin from the hand grenade.
1:5:26|1:5:31|Emperor Hirohito of Japan was forced to announce unconditional surrender.
1:5:36|1:5:51|After Japan's defeat in the war, the officer stationed at the comfort station received a phone call from his superiors, ordering him to immediately dispose of all comfort women. Soon, the comfort women were gathered in an open space, with a machine gun set up in front of them.
1:6:1|1:6:12|Soldiers fired at the comfort women, causing everyone to scatter in panic. Some comfort women were shot and fell to the ground. [Kazumi Akiyama], dressed in a kimono and moving with difficulty, still ran forward desperately.
1:6:12|1:6:22|The officer picked up the gun and aimed at [Kazumi Akiyama], pulled the trigger, a bullet hit [Kazumi Akiyama], the moment of pain made [Kazumi Akiyama] stop in his tracks, turned around and fell straight down.
1:6:23|1:6:33|The scene cuts back to reality, with Liu Hemei collapsed on a bench. In her mind, the image of an officer pointing a gun at himself keeps alternating with reality. Her family members approach to comfort Liu Hemei.
1:7:9|1:7:21|Upon hearing her grandmother's words, Mingming immediately let go of [Kazumi Akiyama]'s hand, as if touching something dirty, tremblingly withdrew it to her chest, stood up shakily, and left the room. [Huang Ziqian] went over to comfort Mingming.
1:7:51|1:8:9|[Kazumi Akiyama] curled up in Xiaoli's arms like a child who had done something wrong. Clearly back home, he tore the uncalmed photos on the wall to pieces. When he saw the photo of [Liu Hemei], he stopped his hand, bit his lip, and punched the wall one by one. His boyfriend grabbed his hand and immediately stopped him.
1:8:22|1:8:26|The boyfriend sighed and clasped his hands together.
1:8:48|1:8:52|The boyfriend furrowed his brow, lowered his head in silent contemplation.
1:9:24|1:9:33|Liu Hemei turned around to leave, but his boyfriend stopped him. Seeing Liu Hemei's agitated back, his boyfriend walked up to him and comforted him earnestly.
1:10:9|1:10:25|The scene returns to the home of [Kazumi Akiyama], where [Liu Hemei] is lying on a recliner covered with a blanket. [Kazumi Akiyama] walks over with a bowl of medicine, squats down next to [Liu Hemei], gently shakes her shoulder to wake her up. [Liu Hemei] opens her eyes and takes the medicine from [Kazumi Akiyama].
1:10:38|1:10:54|[Liu Hemei] heard the comforting words from [Kazumi Akiyama] and couldn't help but shed tears. [Kazumi Akiyama] looked at [Liu Hemei] peacefully and wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes. Then, [Liu Hemei] held medicine in one hand and made a praying gesture with the other hand on her chest, while [Kazumi Akiyama] silently rocked the rocking chair for her.
1:10:54|1:10:57|The next day, the editor-in-chief of the publishing house, [Ms. Su], came to the house.
1:11:10|1:11:13|Upon hearing this, [Liu Hemei] hesitated a bit, and [Editor Suzuki] also hesitated without saying anything more. [Liu Hemei]'s emotions were very complex.
1:12:20|1:12:30|Late at night, [Huang Xiaoli] entered her daughter's room, only to find it pitch black with her daughter sitting on the bed lost in thought. Turning on the light, [Huang Xiaoli] sat beside her daughter and put her arm around her shoulder.
1:13:1|1:13:6|[Huang Xiaoli] and [Zhang Min] watched with red eyes as [Liu Hemei] stood at the door, anxiously trying to defend herself.
1:13:6|1:13:24|[Liu Hemei] finished speaking, sadly turned and left. That night, under the dark clouds and bright moon, [Zhang Min] sat alone in a bar. She touched the necklace around her neck, a jade pendant given to her by her grandmother during the war, then passed down to her mother, and now to herself. It carried the memories of three generations.
1:13:24|1:13:41|And it was because of this jade pendant that Grandma was able to reunite with her family, but she just said such disrespectful words. Back at the hospital, in front of her were the diaries Grandma wrote in the comfort station years ago, with her boyfriend and [Editor Su] sitting on either side of her.
1:15:2|1:15:8|Actually, I really understand Mingming's feelings.
1:15:22|1:15:33|[Xiaoli] hugged her mother tenderly, and soon after, she brought Mingming to Yunnan. Here, they saw the statue of the weeping woman kneeling on the ground that [Kazumi Akiyama] had seen at the memorial hall in the beginning of the film.
1:16:51|1:16:54|At night, [Kazumi Akiyama] leaves a letter for Ziqian.
1:17:37|1:17:48|Ziqian fell asleep on the sofa holding the remote control. [Kazumi Akiyama] placed the letter next to Ziqian's hand and quietly left the house.
1:17:54|1:18:10|After daybreak, Ziqian saw Xiaoli and [Zhang Min] return from Yunnan, and handed the letter left by [Kazumi Akiyama] to [Zhang Min]. Her boyfriend put down the luggage and stood beside Xiaoli, [Zhang Min] took the letter, and when she saw her grandmother's handwriting on it, her legs involuntarily took two steps back.
1:18:10|1:18:22|The family, upon learning that [Liu Hemei] has run away from home, immediately sets out to search for her without taking a break. Xiaoli and [Zhang Min] split up with their boyfriends and editor Su, searching privately on the streets.
1:18:22|1:18:35|They arrived at every place where Liu Hemei might go, whether it was a crowded subway station or a leisurely square. However, in the vast sea of people, there was no sign of Liu Hemei at all. Zhang Min ran anxiously along the roadside.
1:18:40|1:18:47|The boyfriend received a phone call and learned that an old man wanted to jump into the river. He hurriedly went there, and on the bridge was [Kazumi Akiyama].
1:19:4|1:19:20|[Kazumi Akiyama] stood by the bridge, holding her head in pain. She looked up at her daughter.
1:19:37|1:19:46|Under the bridge, white waves surged, rolling in from the horizon, with waves chasing and thunder roaring, rushing in darkness intermittently.
1:19:46|1:20:3|After being rescued on the bridge, [Kazumi Akiyama] was taken to the hospital by her family. Quietly, Ziqian slipped out of the ward, sighed, gently closed the door, and turned to walk towards [Huang Xiaoli]. Looking up at her grandfather, Huang Xiaoli saw his tired face, his once upright figure now somewhat stooped.
1:20:3|1:20:17|He realized that the family had just reunited, but because of his own immaturity, he caused his grandmother to run away from home, almost separating them. He slowly stood up, embraced his grandfather with regret and guilt, and wept on his shoulder.
1:20:17|1:20:31|[Huang Ziqian] said nothing. He looked at Mingming, tears streaming down his face, feeling a pang of sympathy. Without blaming him, he simply patted Mingming's back, supported his arm, and pushed him towards the ward, indicating for Mingming to go in and see his grandmother.
1:20:31|1:20:45|Ziqian watched as Hemei entered the ward and slowly sat down. At that moment, a sudden wave of sorrow overwhelmed her. Her eyes kept blinking, lips tightly closed, and the sadness churned in her throat, making her breathing heavy and her chest rise and fall with each breath.
1:20:46|1:21:2|He looked at the ward, trying hard to restrain himself from crying out loud, sitting motionless in the chair in the corridor like a sculpture. The hospital corridor was empty, with only Kazumi Akiyama's lonely figure, surrounded by silence as if time had come to a standstill.
1:21:2|1:21:12|At this moment, footsteps could be heard approaching from a distance. [Zhang Min] walked over from around the corner, seeing her father sitting alone there. She then walked up to him, knelt down, and held onto his knees.
1:21:15|1:21:41|Ziqian, with a heavy heart and a somewhat listless demeanor, looked up at [Zhang Min], nodded, and then watched as [Zhang Min] stood up and sat next to her father. Ziqian gazed at [Zhang Min], who was unsure how to respond to her father. The two looked at each other in silence, and [Zhang Min] could only turn away in silence.
1:22:2|1:22:11|[Zhang Min] didn't say anything more when she saw her father so determined. She placed her hands on her father's shoulders, and the father and daughter comforted each other.
1:22:11|1:22:22|Later, [Zhang Min] got up and prepared to go to the ward to check on her mother. She was worried about her father again, thinking that now that he was getting old, he had finally reunited with her mother, only to encounter such a sudden change.
1:22:23|1:22:42|She walked step by step towards the ward, but kept looking back at her father. [Huang Xiaoli] entered the ward and saw her mother lying peacefully on the bed, as if asleep. She gently touched her mother's aged feet, recalling her mother's turbulent life. As a comfort woman, being able to survive and walk out of the war era was already extremely difficult.
1:22:43|1:22:57|Having endured physical abuse, [Huang Xiaoli]'s mother only wanted to expose Japan's despicable actions. Now, she also had to endure misunderstandings from her closest ones, as a series of tears silently slid down [Huang Xiaoli]'s face.
1:23:4|1:23:9|In the song, Kazumi Akiyama, who was lying on the hospital bed in a deep sleep, dreamed again of that year in Myanmar.
1:23:15|1:23:29|Since the day they parted, mother and daughter met again after decades. In the scene, the young Lily and the elderly [Kazumi Akiyama] continuously overlapped on the screen. [Liu Hemei] sat quietly alone on a bench in the corridor, with Lily's singing echoing in their hearts.
1:23:30|1:23:49|At this moment, the frame freezes on the serene face of [Liu Hemei]. She tightly closes her lips, and the wrinkles on her forehead slightly move up and down with her breath, as if she hears the singing of Xiaoli and Minmin. Although Hemei has not opened her eyes, a tear falls from the corner of her eye, as Xiaoli's hand touches [Hemei]'s cheek.
1:23:50|1:24:0|His skin, loosened by the passage of time, clearly shows the marks of aging, with every wrinkle on his face telling the story of his painful past.
1:24:0|1:24:10|Perhaps, the once famous Western journalist Kazumi Akiyama has gradually faded from the public's memory, while he, as Liu Hemei, bravely reveals the truth about comfort women to the world in his old age.
1:24:11|1:24:24|The exposure of Japan's lies in the international community and its contribution to world peace will forever be engraved on the monument of history. At this moment, black and white photos of comfort women from dozens of different countries appeared on the screen.
1:24:24|1:24:33|As comfort women one by one depart, these photos also vanish with them, until the entire scene fades into darkness.
