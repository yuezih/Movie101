0:0:46|0:0:50|That day, Prince Bei was rushing to the Divine Mechanism Camp.
0:0:59|0:1:5|Prince Bei, trusted by Empress Dowager Cixi, wielded great power at the time. He vigorously promoted the construction of railways and factories, as well as the modernization of the military.
0:1:27|0:1:33|Prince Bei hurriedly ran within the palace, followed by four maids carrying the Six Harmonies Unified Hat in their hands.
0:1:35|0:1:50|Following closely behind. Just as they turned the corner, a massive and uniquely designed mechanical flying craft flew over the prince's head. This aircraft was extremely domineering, with a perfect integration of mortise and tenon structure and steel bars, but the most eye-catching feature was its flamboyant wings that resembled a phoenix.
0:2:3|0:2:17|Prince Bei looked at the majestic Tianwei Wing in the sky, with a slight smile on his lips, filled with confidence in his heart. He stopped his hurried pace and carefully observed the Tianwei Wing soaring freely above the Forbidden City.
0:2:26|0:2:42|Outside the village of [Chenjia Gou], in the distance, on the destroyed war machine Troy, there lies a groom in a silk jacket and a six-hat. To be lying alone on the ruins on his wedding day, this person is not ordinary.
0:3:55|0:4:2|Yang Luchan, who fell from the ruins, rushed to the hall non-stop to attend the wedding with Chen Yuniang.
0:4:2|0:4:14|On the left and right of the main hall sat the elders of Chen Village, while seated at the top of the hall were Chen Yuniang's father Chen Changxing and the highly respected San Shuzu. However, at this solemn wedding ceremony, Yang Luchan, who was naturally a bit foolish, looked around in confusion.
0:4:15|0:4:22|Even with the reminder from the disciples of the [Chen family], he remembered to kneel in front of the two elders.
0:4:37|0:4:56|In the distance, a loud shout broke the original tranquility. Everyone looked towards the sound and saw two figures outside the door, wearing masks and straw hats, slowly walking towards the hall. Halfway there, the man suddenly threw his hat back into the hall. As the hat left the man's hand, it spun rapidly like a flying knife, as if it could cut through anything.
0:4:56|0:5:3|As the groomsman [Chen Youzhi] saw the situation, he took the lead and kicked his hat from the rooftop into the copper bell below.
0:5:4|0:5:19|[Chen Youzhi] finished speaking, then swiftly flew out of the hall, leaping in mid-air at the steps, arriving in front of the man. Seeing the man unaffected with his head down, [Chen Youzhi] naturally did not hold back, gathering strength in his fist and striking directly at the man's face. Strangely, the man seemed to be familiar with [Chen's] fist movements.
0:5:19|0:5:42|Chen Youzhi had not yet made his next move when he used his right foot as a pivot to lean back and avoid the attack. He then blocked Chen Youzhi's arms with both hands and said, "After hearing about my big brother, Chen Yuniang tore off the red headscarf and ran out."
0:5:48|0:6:2|Chen Zaiyang, the eldest son of the Chen family, saw San Shuzu who had come specially. His eyes gradually moistened, and he couldn't care about catching up with his siblings. He walked through the crowd, straight to San Shuzu, clasped his hands in front of him, bowed deeply, and paid his respects.
0:6:5|0:6:20|After bowing to [San Shuzu], [Chen Zaiyang] slowly shifted his gaze to his father who was still sitting sternly in the hall. The elders in the hall also started to discuss in whispers upon seeing [Chen Zaiyang], but [Chen Changxing] did not show any joy of reunion upon seeing his eldest son who had been wandering outside for many years. Instead, he remained frowning.
0:6:20|0:6:28|[Chen Zaiyang] had a thousand words to say, but now, seeing his stern father, he didn't know where to start. After staring at each other for a long time,
0:6:28|0:6:37|[Chen Changxing] turned and walked towards the room. Faced with this situation, [Chen Zaiyang] obviously did not expect it, standing still at a loss. At this moment, outside the door, [Brother Tofu] shouted,
0:6:46|0:7:7|Just after the little incident, the groom [Yang Luchan] has already finished off the roast chicken on the table. At night, the Chen family's valley was brightly lit, with fireworks going off, as lively as the New Year. [San Shuzu] warmly entertained everyone at the banquet.
0:7:46|0:7:55|It seems that [Chen Zaiyang] and his wife noticed each other's unusual behavior, while on the rooftop, [Chen Changxing] and [Chen Yuniang] were watching [Yang Luchan] inside the house.
0:8:44|0:8:52|Chen Changxing sighed as he looked at his strong-willed daughter, and said very tactfully,
0:9:51|0:10:3|[Chen Changxing] finished speaking, then gracefully leaped down from the high eaves like walking on water. Following that, [Chen Yuniang] entered the room, snatched the leaves from [Yang Luchan]'s hand, and tapped on his head, but [Yang Luchan] just laughed out loud.
0:10:14|0:10:20|[Yang Luchan], although looking puzzled, obediently knelt in front of [Chen Yuniang], who then established the family rules.
0:11:7|0:11:16|Just as [Chen Zaiyang] was pondering with his head down, he suddenly sensed movement outside the door. Before [Chen Zaiyang] could get up, [Jin Yuner] had already silently arrived at the window like a ghost.
0:11:32|0:11:42|After seeing that there was no danger, he slowly closed the window. But at that moment, a dark figure flashed outside. Seeing this figure, [Jin Yuner] immediately hid behind the door pillar and drew out the Indian soft sword hidden in his sleeve.
0:11:46|0:11:57|Upon hearing it was [Chen Youzhi], [Chen Zaiyang] lightly patted [Jin Yuner] on the shoulder to signal her to stay calm, then opened the door.
0:12:9|0:12:16|Upon [Chen Youzhi]'s late-night visit, [Chen Zaiyang], after much contemplation, decided to explain the reasons to him.
0:12:43|0:12:52|The tenth ancestor [Chen Suole], although old with gray temples, effortlessly sent the young and strong Hu Xingmen Zhou Bin flying several meters away.
0:13:48|0:13:58|The crazy monk gathered his energy in his dantian, stood in front of the door, with a scar on his head, a sudden golden light appeared, and his own Buddha energy immediately surrounded him like a golden bell. With just this move, he severely injured several Chen family disciples.
0:15:55|0:16:3|[Chen Zaiyang] remained silent after hearing this, his serious expression making [Chen Youzhi] nervous.
0:16:58|0:17:5|[Chen Zaiyang] looked at the eager [Yang Luchan] and said as if with a plan in mind,
0:17:12|0:17:22|After Chen Zaiyang performed a series of expansive movements, he stood on one leg with his body leaning almost parallel to the ground.
0:17:24|0:17:30|After saying that, [Chen Zaiyang] continued to demonstrate, with his two legs standing on the ground like wooden stakes.
0:17:31|0:17:38|After demonstrating the movements freely swaying like a dragon above the knees, [Yang Luchan] admired and exclaimed,
0:18:2|0:18:10|At this moment, [Chen Zaiyang] slowly walked up to [Yang Luchan], but instead of helping him, he just picked up [Yang Luchan]'s hat and put it back on his head.
0:18:12|0:18:24|Shortly after, [Chen Zaiyang] turned away contemptuously. At this moment, [Yang Luchan], with his arms captured and kneeling on one knee, had a fierce gleam in his eyes, anger building up.
0:18:25|0:18:34|In the hall, [Chen Ersao] is showing [Jin Yuner] around the Chen family disciples practicing boxing. [Jin Yuner] gestures and asks [Chen Ersao] why she doesn't learn boxing.
0:18:40|0:18:47|Glancing up at the bronze bell above the hall, [Chen Ersao] explained when she saw it.
0:19:3|0:19:13|In the narrow path of Chen Family Valley, [Yang Luchan] broke through a thick stone wall in pursuit of the three who had just captured him. Although [Chen Youzhi] managed to avoid [Yang Luchan]'s attacks, the momentum of [Yang Luchan] continued to shake him.
0:19:13|0:19:25|At the same time, [Jin Yuner] in the hall saw that there was no one around, so she leaped up and landed cleanly on the bronze bell. Meanwhile, in the alley, [Chen Youzhi] was so frightened by [Yang Luchan]'s momentum that he lost all his fighting spirit and turned to run.
0:19:25|0:19:35|Back in the hall, just as the bronze bell was still swaying, a figure with hands behind slowly walked out from the room. Meanwhile in the village, Yang Luchan did not catch up with Chen Youzhi, but managed to capture Brother Tofu.
0:19:36|0:19:46|After a brief exchange, [Yang Luchan] kicked [Brother Tofu] to the ground, but he did not kill him. Instead, he let out a roar and chased after the mahjong sister ahead.
0:19:46|0:19:53|[Yang Luchan] was arrogant and unreasonable all the way, causing chaos wherever he went, and finally found the fleeing Mahjong Sister in the market.
0:19:53|0:20:6|Mahjong Sister quickly picked up a wine jar nearby and used her internal strength to smash towards [Yang Luchan]. However, all of this couldn't stop [Yang Luchan]'s movements. Just as [Yang Luchan] was about to punch Mahjong Sister, a villager wielding a wooden stick viciously struck him from behind.
0:20:8|0:20:15|The strike did not take down Yang Luchan, but instead put himself in danger. Yang Luchan lifted the villagers high, glaring angrily at the surrounding crowd.
0:20:17|0:20:25|Just as [Yang Luchan] was about to lose his mind and throw the villagers down heavily, a dazzling light shone on his eyes.
0:20:25|0:20:38|Just at that moment, the Three Flowers Gathering Peak malfunctioned, and [Yang Luchan] slowly closed his eyes. His nostrils still sprayed two streams of blood as before, and he fainted to the ground. The villagers in his hands were thus fortunate to escape disaster.
0:20:39|0:20:58|On the other side, in a bustling street outside the north gate of Tianjin, many workers were moving goods of all sizes, with merchants coming and going, and of course, there were also patrolling soldiers. On this outer street, a tall building stood out, although it had been sealed off, just its momentum alone indicated that it was not a place to enter casually.
0:20:58|0:21:5|At this moment, a man in front of the gate blatantly ignored the law, tore off the seal, and then pried open the chains to enter.
0:21:5|0:21:20|Upon closer inspection, the man in front of us is none other than the engineer Fang Zijing who led the invasion of Chenjiagou with the Trojan army in the previous installment. With a face full of wounds, Fang Zijing turned around only to be shocked by the imposing presence of the Tianwei Wing hovering above the factory. Although the Tianwei Wing is now in ruins, its aura still sends shivers down one's spine.
0:21:21|0:21:29|[Fang Zijing] slowly approached, his gaze never leaving Tianwei Yi from the moment he entered the room. He looked at the incredible figure in front of him and muttered to himself,
0:22:2|0:22:7|At this moment, the door was suddenly opened by several foreigners.
0:22:12|0:22:25|Facing the taunts of the soldiers, the leading foreigner remained silent and calmly stepped forward. At this moment, the captain of the soldiers said to his men,
0:22:39|0:22:49|Seeing someone supporting him, [Fang Zijing] quickly regained his composure and his face was filled with pride. After being taken away by [Fei Linming], [Fang Zijing] spoke to him in the carriage,
0:23:0|0:23:6|After speaking, he threw the account book to [Fang Zijing].
0:23:33|0:23:46|After that, [Fei Linming] gave a tremendously eerie smile to [Fang Zijing]. [Fang Zijing] was now absent-minded, feeling extremely anxious as he looked at the account book with different quantities recorded on it.
0:23:47|0:24:2|In the pharmacy of Chen Family Valley, several people who were injured by Yang Luchan endured the pain and took their medicine, while Yang Luchan, who was unconscious, had his hands tied and handcuffed to the cabinet. After this outbreak, the color of the three flowers on Yang Luchan's head had deepened.
0:24:25|0:24:31|[Chen Zaiyang] widened his eyes in disbelief after hearing this, and after a moment of contemplation, he slowly said,
0:24:42|0:24:51|After listening to the words of elder brother [Chen Zaiyang], [Chen Yuniang] also wavered in her heart. She came to the top of the village's Troy alone, overlooking the only small road leading into the village.
0:24:51|0:25:6|A few months ago, [Fang Zijing] drove this huge machine to flatten the village. In order to cut ties with [Fang Zijing] for the village, [Chen Yuniang] still had lingering feelings for him from their childhood. As she thought about it, tears filled her eyes.
0:25:8|0:25:16|[Chen Yuniang], who has always been thinking about love between men and women, is still practicing with [Yang Luchan] in a perfunctory manner. Her martial arts moves are all based on muscle memory, with her mind elsewhere.
0:25:30|0:25:42|[Chen Yuniang] had lost interest in teaching, turned around and left. At this moment, [Chen Changxing] shouted from a distance, and [Yang Luchan] turned around to see the sect leader hanging upside down on a tree, so he hurried over.
0:26:40|0:26:48|[Chen Changxing] listened and suddenly widened his eyes in surprise. After carefully examining [Yang Luchan] for a moment, he glanced at his Three Flower Gathering on Top.
0:26:53|0:27:15|Later, [Chen Changxing] walked away contentedly, leaving [Yang Luchan] behind. Yang did not become conceited after receiving praise. Instead, the alleviation of the backlash from the Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown allowed him to think more flexibly and feel life more delicately. Watching the villagers picking herbs, their movements integrated with the Chen-style boxing, he had a deeper understanding of the Chen-style boxing in an instant.
0:27:15|0:27:25|At the same time, a wall with a foreign atmosphere was built on a barren land on the outskirts of Tianjin, with graves of various sizes arranged inside the courtyard.
0:27:27|0:27:41|The inscription on a tombstone in one of the cemeteries reads in English: "This is the love of my life," and the signature below the sorrowful words is [Fang Zijing]. He leans against the tombstone for his girlfriend [Fang Zijing], who was killed along with Troy, with empty and lifeless eyes.
0:27:41|0:27:51|Every time he thinks of Claire, he comes here, and stays for several hours. At this moment, Fang Zijing sees Duke Fei Linming approaching him from the corner of his eye, and says,
0:29:2|0:29:20|Fei Linming still looked back at Fang Zijing disdainfully, but when he saw the determined and ambitious look in Fang Zijing's eyes, his expression gradually became serious. At night, only a few households in Chen Family Valley still had lights on. Yang Luchan stood on the roof, diligently practicing as usual.
0:29:20|0:29:35|[Yang Luchan] practiced boxing while contemplating, as if entering a state of forgetfulness. By the window, [Chen Yuniang], still pondering about love and family, suddenly heard a commotion outside. Without hesitation, [Chen Yuniang] rushed out to investigate. She looked around upon hearing the noise, only to find [Chen Changxing] sitting on a chair outside the door.
0:29:41|0:29:46|Chen Changxing did not speak, but instead opened the intricately carved and complex wooden mechanism in his hand.
0:30:2|0:30:9|[Chen Yuniang] hadn't finished speaking when the sound of a bronze bell came from the village. Sitting beside her, [Chen Changxing] calmly said,
0:30:12|0:30:27|The next day arrived in the blink of an eye, with sudden changes in the weather and the sky darkening. As soon as the day broke, the villagers rushed to the hall, with Yang Luchan following closely behind Chen Yuniang.
0:30:28|0:30:46|As the two entered the hall, they were shocked and speechless by the scene before them. They saw a massive bronze bell, weighing thousands of kilograms, spinning rapidly as if driven by some unknown force. Several senior elders who had arrived early knelt down and kowtowed to the bell, as if praying for the forgiveness of the gods.
0:31:13|0:31:21|Facing the malicious words from the people of Chen Village, Yang Luchan was unable to argue back, while his wife Chen Yuniang wanted to shut everyone up with her actions.
0:31:22|0:31:33|[Chen Yuniang] was about to step forward to stop the bronze bell, but her shoulder was held down by a hand. Before she could react, [Chen Zaiyang] leaped up and landed in front of the bronze bell. The bronze bell was originally as heavy as a thousand catties and could not be moved.
0:31:33|0:31:42|The increased rotational force of the high-speed spinning is now difficult to estimate. However, in the face of this awe-inspiring behemoth, [Chen Zaiyang] remains extremely calm, as he channels his energy to his dantian and delivers a palm strike.
0:31:59|0:32:5|Chen Zaiyang finished demonstrating the most basic techniques of the Chen family fist around him, returned to his original position, and gathered his energy again.
0:32:11|0:32:22|[Chen Zaiyang] seized the opportunity, gathering all his strength into his palms, and struck the bronze bell. The bell, weighing thousands of pounds, surprisingly rolled in the air for two rounds before landing steadily. After dealing with the bronze bell,
0:32:22|0:32:30|[Chen Zaiyang] turned around with a hint of pride, standing in front of everyone. After witnessing it with their own eyes, everyone present was impressed by [Chen Zaiyang]'s skill.
0:32:31|0:32:40|And besides what everyone saw on the scene, [Jin Yuner] was also closely observing from the rooftop.
0:32:40|0:32:52|At this moment, a figure quietly flew from the other end of the roof. [Jin Yuner] was indistinguishable in the sunlight, so she quickly drew her sword. But as soon as the sword was drawn, she was kicked away. [Jin Yuner] immediately regained her composure and stabbed towards the man with her flexible sword, which was soft and hard at the same time.
0:32:52|0:33:0|Unpredictable and elusive, his swordsmanship is truly hard to grasp. The man who was almost injured leaped into the air and then stood on the eaves, slowly turning around.
0:33:11|0:33:22|[Jin Yuner] saw [Chen Changxing], she confessed truthfully: at that time, she was hiding inside the bronze bell, fixing the base of the instrument on the top of the bronze bell, just gently shaking it, the three iron balls hanging from the instrument would spin rapidly.
0:33:22|0:33:29|After finishing her instructions, [Jin Yuner] flew off the eaves. At this moment, inside the hall, [San Shuzu] announced,
0:33:50|0:33:59|Chen Zaiyang seemed to be playing with his little sister on the side, but in fact he listened attentively to every word everyone said. He slowly turned around, with a look of melancholy, and walked up to San Shuzu.
0:34:8|0:34:15|After [Chen Zaiyang] politely declined, he never expected that no one would persuade him again. Seeing this situation, he could only say again,
0:34:40|0:34:51|As soon as the words fell, [Chen Changxing], who had been observing for a long time, stepped on the roof and fell into the house. Upon seeing his father's sudden arrival, [Chen Zaiyang] became nervous.
0:35:12|0:35:22|Seeing [Chen Zaiyang] remaining silent, [Chen Changxing] took out a letter from his sleeve and stood in front of him.
0:36:11|0:36:23|[Yang Luchan] looked nervously at [Chen Yuniang], while on the other side, [Chen Zaiyang] was also pressured by [San Shuzu]. Under the heavy pressure, [Chen Zaiyang], seeing the confident [San Shuzu] beside him, reluctantly moved forward.
0:36:23|0:36:37|Standing opposite, [Yang Luchan] could only grit his teeth and walk to the front. At this moment, the two stood in front of the hall in full view of everyone, but their desire to fight was not high. Seeing [Chen Changxing] hesitating to make a move, he began to instruct [Yang Luchan].
0:36:39|0:36:55|[Yang Luchan] follows orders and assumes a stance, with a stable lower body, left arm straight, left hand in a hook shape, and right palm blocking in front. As this move is executed, the momentum is completely different from before. [Chen Changxing] sees [Chen Zaiyang] starting his move and continues to say,
0:36:56|0:37:8|As soon as the two started, they found that [Chen Zaiyang]'s previous skills were full of flaws. At this moment, [Yang Luchan] lifted his right foot in front of [Chen Zaiyang] without exerting force, and [Chen Changxing] realized that [Yang Luchan] was intentionally holding back.
0:37:10|0:37:15|The force of the paper ball pushed [Chen Zaiyang] back several meters, at this moment, [Chen Zaiyang] did not have the same strength as when he struck the bell.
0:37:20|0:37:30|Upon hearing Chen Yuniang's confusion, Chen Changxing did not explain. Chen Zaiyang's punches were all deflected, his body gradually stiffening, unable to fight back. At this moment, Yang Luchan's high probing horse move threw Chen Zaiyang into the air.
0:37:31|0:37:45|After the reversal, seizing the opportunity, [Chen Zaiyang] delivered a final powerful double push hands. Struck by this move, [Yang Luchan] was sent flying through the air, and his robe was shattered by the internal force. However, at that moment, to everyone's surprise, they found that besides the robe being shattered,
0:37:45|0:37:54|Flying out with him were many mechanical parts. Everyone present, except for [Chen Changxing], hung their heads in sigh, all deeply moved by the scene.
0:37:54|0:38:21|Originally, the profound skills displayed by [Chen Zaiyang] were all enhanced by the machine he developed. His solid foundation was also due to the nails in his shoes piercing into the ground. The reason that triggered [Yang Luchan]'s outburst was not because he couldn't bear the humiliation, but because when [Chen Zaiyang] put a hat on him, he inserted a silver needle into his corner. As a father, [Chen Changxing] looked at the sky full of parts and the gears still spinning, falling into memories of Zaiyang's childhood.
0:38:21|0:38:27|On a sunny afternoon many years ago, [Chen Changxing] happily accompanied [Chen Yuniang] as they swung on a swing.
0:38:28|0:38:34|At this moment, [Chen Zaiyang] ran up to his father with his younger brothers and said,
0:38:36|0:38:53|Soon after, [Chen Changxing] sat up with a smile on his face, looking forward to [Chen Zaiyang]'s boxing technique. His younger brothers and sisters also sat on the side, ready to learn. After [Chen Zaiyang] was ready, he turned to face [Chen Changxing], performing the Diamond Pound followed by the Cross Hands, a set of movements and techniques flowing smoothly and impressively.
0:38:53|0:39:6|[Chen Changxing] watched as [Chen Zaiyang] made rapid progress, nodding in approval. His younger siblings were even more fascinated, admiring him greatly. Seeing the satisfied expressions of everyone, [Chen Zaiyang] leaped high into the air, followed by a move known as "White Crane Spreads its Wings," which further heightened the atmosphere.
0:39:9|0:39:17|At this moment, [Chen Changxing] had already put away his smile, and instead looked at [Chen Zaiyang] with a serious expression, as if he was gradually discovering clues from Chen Zaiyang's movements.
0:39:17|0:39:30|At this moment, [Chen Zaiyang], who was spinning and high kicking on the side, gradually lost control. His movements became stiff, the kicks turned mechanical, and his body spun faster and faster. He tried hard to regain control, but faced with the powerful mechanical force, his efforts were in vain.
0:39:32|0:39:43|[Chen Changxing] quickly followed the direction of the rotation and grabbed [Chen Zaiyang]'s right hand, pulling him into his arms. At this moment, the machine also exceeded its load, and numerous parts popped out of the clothes, scattering all over the ground.
0:39:43|0:39:51|Chen Zaiyang's mechanical vest covered with gears on his chest is prominently displayed. Chen Changxing, seeing this scene, was stunned and speechless for a long time.
0:39:51|0:40:13|He angrily threw [Chen Zaiyang] on the ground, [Chen Changxing] sighed with disappointment, then turned and walked towards the house. Seeing this, his younger siblings hurried forward to help him up. The scene in the hall now was just like many years ago. With tears in his eyes, [Chen Changxing] sighed and said,
0:40:14|0:40:20|He finished speaking, without even looking at [Chen Zaiyang], he walked straight towards the door. Seeing this, [Chen Zaiyang] felt even more wronged.
0:40:20|0:40:40|At this moment, [Chen Yuniang] noticed the distress of [Chen Zaiyang] and persuaded him. After hearing this, [Chen Zaiyang] burst into tears, broke free from the support of the crowd, and shouted. Although [Chen Changxing] did not turn around, he slowed down his pace. After wiping away his tears, [Chen Zaiyang] sat on the ground and continued to speak.
0:41:10|0:41:19|San Shuzu, after hearing the truth, hung his head in frustration like iron unable to turn into steel.
0:41:23|0:41:33|The brothers and sisters around him were very angry after hearing this, but looking at the elder brother in front of them full of helplessness and grievances, even with all the resentment, they became understandable in the face of family affection.
0:41:33|0:41:50|[Chen Zaiyang] finished speaking, his eyes moist as he glanced at the deceived [Yang Luchan]. After a long pause, a tear of regret rolled down his cheek, but he said nothing more, slowly standing up and looking towards [San Shuzu]. [San Shuzu], seeing the one who almost caused a great disaster, showed no pity, and simply turned and walked away.
0:41:52|0:41:59|The elders were like grass on the wall, speaking ill of [Chen Zaiyang], but these harsh words did not affect the eldest son of the sect leader.
0:41:59|0:42:11|For Chen Zaiyang, who doesn't love practicing martial arts, it seems like he has long been tired of hearing it. Dragging his disheveled body, he dejectedly walked towards the gate and left slowly. After changing into a new outfit, he didn't stop for a moment.
0:42:11|0:42:27|With his wife [Jin Yuner], [Chen Changxing] left [Chen Village]. At this moment, [Chen Yuniang] and [Yang Luchan] caught up on horseback. When called out, [Chen Zaiyang] turned around and looked somewhat surprised at the two dismounting. [Chen Yuniang] ran up to her older brother with a embroidered cloth bag in her hands and said,
0:42:28|0:42:34|[Chen Zaiyang] pulled out a wooden box from the cloth bag with a puzzled expression, and exclaimed in surprise after opening it,
0:42:43|0:42:50|Chen Zaiyang suddenly understood after hearing this, that although his father was strict in every way, he still cared for him at all times.
0:42:52|0:43:1|At this moment, Yang Luchan handed the reins of the horse to his eldest brother with a look of reluctance, Chen Zaiyang took the reins and looked at the simple and honest young man in front of him, saying,
0:43:3|0:43:11|Just as Chen Zaiyang's tears seemed about to fall, he turned around and left Chenjiagou with his wife on horseback. What Zaiyang didn't know was,
0:43:11|0:43:24|This time, not only [Chen Yuniang] and [Chen Changxing] came to see them off. [Chen Changxing], who had long been hidden above Troy, had moist eyes, enduring the pain of separation, watching his son gradually leave. Perhaps this is the stern father's way of expressing love.
0:43:26|0:43:35|On the night when [Chen Zaiyang] and his wife left [Chen Family Valley], [Jiang Yanhao], the governor of Henan Province, played music on a phonograph in his warehouse filled with embezzled goods.
0:43:35|0:43:48|Accompanied by cheerful music, [Jiang Yanhao] proudly looked at the wall full of national treasure-level antique vases. After hesitating for a moment, he picked up a favorite flambe-glazed plum vase and examined it carefully. But at that moment, Indian cavalry forces suddenly descended.
0:43:48|0:44:1|The sudden sound in the theater startled [Jiang Yanhao], causing the enamel bottle to slip from his hand, but luckily it fell on his foot and did not break. By the time he reacted, several Indian soldiers with rifles had surrounded him. [Jiang Yanhao] pretended
0:44:3|0:44:9|Shouting loudly, but the soldiers showed no fear on their faces after hearing it, still holding their rifles high and aiming at [Jiang Yanhao].
0:44:9|0:44:22|At this moment, an official dressed in a catcher's uniform and wearing a lotus hat slowly picked up the enamel bottle that had fallen to the ground. Because this person held the enamel bottle in front of him, [Jiang Yanhao] could not see his face and dared not act rashly. However, he soon realized that this person was none other than [Fang Zijing].
0:44:25|0:44:32|Upon Jiang Yanhao's words, Fang Zijing immediately smashed the priceless Ruby Red Plum Vase on the ground.
0:45:0|0:45:13|[Fang Zijing] listened without any change in his gloomy face, walked slowly to [Jiang Yanhao]'s front, and looked at the timid [Jiang Yanhao] as he whispered,
0:45:26|0:45:40|Under the command of [Fang Zijing], the soldiers escorted the corrupt official [Jiang Yanhao] out. The room full of gold, silver, antiques, and paintings did not interest [Fang Zijing] at all. He didn't even spare a glance at them, instead he walked over to the phonograph to enjoy the music.
0:45:41|0:45:59|Late at night, in Chen Family Valley, Chen Yuniang turned over in the middle of the night only to find that Yang Luchan on the bedroll was nowhere to be seen. Knowing Yang Luchan's habits well, she put on her clothes and leaped onto the roof to ask,
0:46:7|0:46:26|The next morning, the market in Tianjin was already filled with vendors. At this moment, when [Jin Yuner] saw the patrolling soldiers approaching, she signaled for [Chen Zaiyang] to avoid them. [Chen Zaiyang], quick-witted, grabbed [Jin Yuner] and ran to a steamed bun shop, pretending to be customers. Keeping an eye on the soldiers as they passed by, [Chen Zaiyang] quickly left as well.
0:46:28|0:46:38|At this point, the two of them no longer had the leisurely mood they had while walking just now, walking quickly with their heads slightly lowered along the bustling street. When they arrived at their factory, they found that the seal and iron chain on the gate were still intact.
0:46:45|0:46:56|Chen Zaiyang ran forward three steps and two steps, looking impatiently at the seal about to tear it off. After some persuasion, Chen Zaiyang followed Jin Yuner's advice and came to the back window of the factory. Chen Zaiyang gestured to Jin Yuner, and then...
0:46:56|0:47:13|Alone, he climbed up the boxes stacked by the rear window, taking just three or four steps to reach the top box. Then, [Chen Zaiyang] did not rush to push the window open, but cautiously peeked inside through the slits of the blinds to check the situation. After confirming that there was no one inside the factory, [Chen Zaiyang] then climbed in.
0:47:13|0:47:19|Accidentally, Chen Zaiyang took a tumble, which must have been quite painful for someone who never practices martial arts.
0:47:19|0:47:33|He endured the pain and slowly opened his eyes, only to find that the former glory of the factory had long disappeared, replaced by the scene of rats everywhere, like a ruin. But when he saw the parts on the ground, he ignored the pain and quickly got up to pick them up.
0:47:33|0:47:41|Watching his hard work being thrown on the ground like scrap metal, Chen Changxing felt a myriad of emotions in his heart, and tears welled up in his eyes.
0:47:41|0:47:53|After a moment, he looked up at the sky, only the framework of the Tianwei Wing remained, although it was broken, it still made Chen Zaiyang feel extremely proud. He fantasized about himself flying the perfect Tianwei Wing in the sky, soaring freely and flying recklessly.
0:47:53|0:48:2|When he came to his senses, he still stared at Tianweiyi closely. But just as he choked up, the factory door slowly opened. Chen Zaiyang thought it was Jin Yuner and said,
0:48:4|0:48:11|When [Chen Zaiyang] turned around, he found that [Jin Yuner] had already been captured by the ambushed soldiers. Four soldiers surrounded [Jin Yuner] with their blades at her neck.
0:48:11|0:48:20|The two of them, under duress, were later brought back to the yamen. But after the two knelt in the hall, [Fang Zijing], a fourth-ranking official, slowly walked towards the front of the hall.
0:48:20|0:48:30|[Fang Zijing] was dressed in a mandarin square jacket, with a red tassel hat on his head, sitting in the hall. His imposing manner was even more majestic under the blessing of the turquoise stone at the top of the tassel hat.
0:48:32|0:48:39|[Chen Zaiyang] heard the voice and found it somewhat familiar. He slowly raised his head and looked up, never expecting that it was indeed [Fang Zijing], the Taoist master.
0:48:40|0:48:47|[Chen Zaiyang] saw that it was someone familiar and casually sat down cross-legged on the ground before saying,
0:48:49|0:48:56|[Fang Zijing]'s words made [Chen Zaiyang] feel extremely embarrassed, but due to the huge disparity in their status, he had no choice but to kneel down again on the spot.
0:49:15|0:49:22|[Fang Zijing] saw [Chen Zaiyang] pretending to be silent, so he viciously said to his subordinates,
0:50:43|0:50:52|[Chen Zaiyang] tearfully watched [Fang Zijing] walk away, choked up as he confirmed with him once again,
0:51:6|0:51:15|At this moment, in the mountains and forests of Chen Family Valley, [Chen Changxing] and [Yang Luchan] were hanging upside down on a thick tree branch together. After a moment, [Yang Luchan] asked in confusion,
0:51:27|0:51:32|[Yang Luchan] followed suit after hearing it.
0:51:43|0:51:58|[Chen Changxing] lazily yawned and then turned to look at [Yang Luchan], who was breathing deeply. Just a few rounds later, [Yang Luchan] suddenly opened his eyes in enlightenment and said, recalling the scene of [Chen Yuniang] practicing with a low spirit.
0:52:2|0:52:8|[Chen Changxing] listened and finally showed a relieved expression on his face, then came down from the tree branch and was about to leave.
0:52:15|0:52:26|[Chen Changxing] said, then waved his hand and walked out of the woods, leaving only [Yang Luchan] still hanging upside down on a tree, experiencing the state of mind of watching with the heart. At noon, in the village, [Chen Yuniang] was fetching water from the well, preparing to cook.
0:52:26|0:52:33|[Chen Yuniang] still had a distracted look on her face. Just then, the sound of iron being struck could be heard coming from the village entrance.
0:52:37|0:52:44|Distracted by the sound, Chen Yuniang accidentally knocked over the water bucket she had just fetched. Moments later, many villagers rushed to the village entrance upon hearing the commotion.
0:52:47|0:52:56|Yang Luchan was seen frantically striking inside the damaged Troy, with villagers applauding the deafening sound of each blow.
0:52:58|0:53:23|[Yang Luchan], although bare-handed, still shattered the ironclad Troy into pieces. At this moment, [Chen Yuniang] rushed over and stood on top of Troy, looking at the mad boy in front of her and asked. [Yang Luchan] finished speaking and continued to strike.
0:53:23|0:53:38|At this moment, [Chen Yuniang], upon hearing such sincere words, tears quietly welled up in her eyes. She neither agreed nor stopped, but jumped off the Trojan horse and slowly walked towards the village. As [Chen Yuniang] walked further and further away, more tears gathered in her eyes.
0:53:38|0:53:55|Just as she was about to reveal it, she stopped in her tracks, called out to [Yang Luchan], and after [Chen Yuniang] finished speaking, a relieved smile appeared on her face. Upon hearing this, [Yang Luchan] also stopped and walked to [Chen Yuniang]'s side, saying,
0:53:59|0:54:10|As soon as everyone dispersed, a screw in the Trojan suddenly loosened, and then the entire massive steel fortress could no longer withstand the collapse caused by the profound internal force of [Yang Luchan].
0:54:10|0:54:19|Several days later, the Governor of Zhili Province, accompanied by various officials, arrived at an observation platform on the outskirts. At this moment, the three mighty and domineering cannons below the platform were already poised and ready to fire.
0:54:21|0:54:28|Suddenly, a flash of fire appeared on the land thousands of meters away.
0:55:21|0:55:37|Fang Zijing naturally understood the meaning of these words, and then handed over the prepared ten thousand taels of silver notes from the book, offering them with both hands. Upon seeing the silver notes, the governor immediately relaxed and said,
0:56:6|0:56:14|[Fang Zijing] eyes rolled and he immediately had an idea.
0:56:16|0:56:23|That night, [Chen Zaiyang], who was sleeping, suddenly woke up in a panic, gasping for breath. He said to his wife who was guarding beside him,
0:56:28|0:56:36|Shortly after, he immediately got up, lifted the mattress, and a protruding nail appeared on the bed board. He pulled out the nail, and a millennium huai yam popped out from the mechanism.
0:56:42|0:56:50|Upon finishing speaking, he then pulled the rope tied to the blueprint, slowly unfolding it. [Jin Yuner] saw that the blueprint was intricately drawn with detailed parts of the Heavenly Wing.
0:57:1|0:57:11|Late at night, after a day of practicing martial arts, [Yang Luchan] returned to his room exhausted as usual after taking a shower.
0:57:12|0:57:26|After closing the door, he casually put on his pajamas, without saying a word, and dove straight into the bed he had been sleeping on for days. As he lay down, he saw Chen Yuniang standing by the window with a heavy heart, but Yang Luchan, who didn't understand women, did not offer any comfort, only saying,
0:57:27|0:57:39|[Chen Yuniang] turned around and looked at this somewhat silly but extremely innocent young man. Thinking of how he had fought for her today, she closed the window and said to him,
0:57:42|0:57:49|[Chen Yuniang] finished speaking and walked towards the embroidered bed, but when she turned around, she found [Yang Luchan] at a loss on the floor.
0:57:50|0:57:59|After receiving the instructions again, [Yang Luchan] finally felt relieved and crawled out of bed to lie down. [Chen Yuniang] was lying on the bed with her back to [Yang Luchan]. After a moment, she realized that [Yang Luchan] was not moving.
0:57:59|0:58:17|So she shyly turned around, but when [Chen Yuniang] turned back, she saw [Yang Luchan]'s feet. Obviously not understanding the meaning of [Chen Yuniang]'s words, [Yang Luchan] turned around and said,
0:58:19|0:58:25|[Chen Yuniang] took off her hairpin and used it to extinguish the lantern in the room.
0:58:32|0:58:46|Shortly after, [Chen Yuniang] took the initiative to throw herself on [Yang Luchan], and the two began the long-awaited intimacy between husband and wife. In the next room, [Chen Changxing], who was sleeping soundly, suddenly opened his eyes wide upon hearing some movement, hesitantly looking towards the dark room where [Chen Yuniang] was.
0:58:46|0:58:52|After this night, [Chen Yuniang] and [Yang Luchan] became even more spiritually connected in their martial arts practice.
0:59:3|0:59:20|Days have passed since the two of them shared the same room. During this time, [Chen Yuniang] has finally moved on from her feelings for [Fang Zijing] and has wholeheartedly devoted herself to [Yang Luchan]. Day and night, [Chen Yuniang] accompanies [Yang Luchan] in his martial arts practice, helping him to better understand the essence of the Chen Family Boxing.
0:59:23|0:59:38|As [Chen Changxing], who had been observing the two from the shadows, saw [Yang Luchan]'s martial arts skills improving day by day and the relationship between the couple becoming closer day by day, he happily placed a record into the phonograph to listen to the music. Meanwhile, under the careful guidance and yin-yang harmonization of [Chen Yuniang], [Yang Luchan]...
0:59:38|0:59:45|His skills have also made remarkable progress, and although his boxing skills are not as good as the sect leader [Chen Changxing], he is now invincible in the village.
0:59:45|1:0:2|Just as [Yang Luchan] was still diligently trying to comprehend the essence of Chen Family Boxing, no one expected that a disaster was quietly approaching Chen Family Valley. One morning, in the deep gorge leading to Chen Family Valley, [Fang Zijing] was leading a large army. [Fang Zijing] was seen wearing a fourth-rank official uniform, riding on horseback.
1:0:2|1:0:19|His face was dark and his eyes were filled with endless resentment. Behind him followed dozens of fully armed cavalry soldiers from the Divine Machine Camp. Passing through the cavalry camp, one could see the three towering and majestic German Krupp cannons, exuding a domineering aura. These massive cannons, weighing as much as a thousand pounds.
1:0:19|1:0:31|It took a full 12 people to slowly push it. After an hour, a large number of troops had already assembled at the gate of [Chen Family Village], with three heavy cannons lined up in front of the formation. At this time, the villagers of [Chen Family Gou] were still.
1:0:31|1:0:40|Still immersed in a deep sleep, completely unaware. After all preparations were completed, the captain of the Divine Machine Battalion asked [Fang Zijing],
1:0:51|1:1:6|Three cannonballs were seen flying out with a loud noise. Due to the high temperature propulsion, the cannonballs drew three parabolic arcs in the air before accurately landing in the village. After each round of firing, the cannon operator would make slight adjustments to the cannon before reloading the cannonballs, ensuring that each bombarded area was different each time.
1:1:6|1:1:25|In this way, the villagers of [Chen Family Village] were subjected to indiscriminate bombing, and the once beautiful and peaceful [Chen Family Village] was instantly reduced to ruins, with houses collapsing. Although the villagers were all skilled in Chen Family Fist, at this moment they could only flee. As [Chen Yuniang] and her husband evacuated the crowd to escape, they noticed [Chen Changxing] standing on top of a several-meter-high archway.
1:1:33|1:1:48|[Yang Luchan] remained calm after hearing this, instead smiling as he leaped high into the air, kicking several times on the pillar before landing on the archway. Once [Yang Luchan] stabilized himself, [Chen Changxing] suddenly noticed that the three flowers on top of his head had completely disappeared.
1:1:49|1:1:55|[Chen Changxing] nodded in satisfaction, then looked towards the village being destroyed and asked [Yang Luchan],
1:2:8|1:2:20|At this moment, the captain of the Divine Mechanism Camp outside the village looked at the devastated Chen Family Valley and asked,
1:2:28|1:2:42|The once dilapidated Chen Family Valley, driven by [Fang Zijing]'s vengeful heart, is about to be razed to the ground. The captain of the Divine Mechanism Battalion rides to the village entrance and shouts,
1:2:47|1:3:0|In this extremely critical moment, [Chen Changxing] and [Yang Luchan] were calmly having breakfast. At this time, [Chen Youzhi] rushed in and said,
1:3:9|1:3:25|After Chen Youzhi left, Chen Changxing remained calm and composed, not rushing to give orders, but leisurely finished the food in his bowl. Then, he looked at the two of them and slowly said,
1:3:57|1:4:5|Upon finishing speaking, [Chen Changxing] slammed the table and stood on it with such speed and strength that his outer garment still maintained its human shape.
1:4:6|1:4:12|The two of them stood up and walked to their father, bowing with their hands clasped together.
1:4:18|1:4:35|[Chen Changxing] finished speaking, then handed a token shaped like a Bagua mirror to [Yang Luchan]. After exchanging a glance with each other, the two of them, along with [Chen Changxing], walked towards the village entrance. Just as the three of them stepped out of the house, the previous dining table was shattered by a shell, and the house collapsed under the successive bombardment.
1:4:35|1:4:51|After a moment, the village gate slowly opened, and three people walked side by side like shooting stars. Their calm faces and majestic aura made thousands of enemy soldiers hold their breath and break out in a cold sweat. The three of them did not stop at all, and walked straight towards the front of the army.
1:4:51|1:5:7|[Fang Zijing] saw the three approaching closer and closer, a sense of unease rising within him. He then ordered dozens of soldiers in front of the formation to aim their rifles at the three and slowly advance. Even the cavalry in soft armor beside [Fang Zijing] followed closely behind, intending to block the three a hundred meters away.
1:5:7|1:5:20|After a moment, the three were surrounded by dozens of muskets pointed at their heads. The soldiers, though armed with muskets, did not dare to slack off in the slightest in the face of the three in front of them. They were all fully focused, fingers on the triggers, ready to fire at any moment.
1:5:20|1:5:32|The encirclement seemed too tight for Chen Changxing to see Fang Zijing on horseback, so he gently pushed aside the musket in front of him. However, the soldiers showed no mercy and pressed the musket against his face.
1:6:34|1:6:40|As soon as [Fang Zijing] finished speaking, the three of them rushed out of the encirclement of the musketeers like lightning.
1:6:42|1:6:58|At the moment before the gunfire, the three individuals leaped up from the ground, causing the cavalry to fall down. After exchanging a smile, the husband and wife each went their separate ways. The remaining cavalry, armed with sharp blades, charged towards the three with fierce expressions. Despite their imposing stature, they lacked agility.
1:6:58|1:7:4|[Chen Changxing] seized the opportunity, dodging the attack like gliding on the ground, and struck the horse's belly with two fingers, causing the cavalry to fall one after another.
1:7:4|1:7:28|At this moment, the cavalry formation is in chaos, and Yang Luchan and his wife swiftly deal with the remaining cavalry from the edge. Seeing the situation turning bad, Fang Zijing shouts out. The cavalry captain, upon receiving the order, draws his sword and charges towards Chen Changxing. Chen Changxing agilely dodges, then lifts the horse's mouth with one hand, causing the warhorse to raise its front hoof. Seizing the opportunity, he strikes the horse's belly again, sending the captain flying several meters away.
1:7:30|1:7:40|Under the command of [Fang Zijing], thousands of soldiers armed with spears and blades surged towards [Chen Changxing]. After a series of pushes, [Chen Changxing] managed to knock down the vanguard soldiers, but faced with more soldiers charging towards him incessantly.
1:7:40|1:7:58|He could only escape from the ground and jump onto the cannon. Meanwhile, the couple [Yang Luchan] who were still on the ground were engaged in a fierce battle. Although they fought with one punch each, they were no match for four hands, and soon found themselves surrounded by enemy troops. To help them out of the predicament, [Chen Changxing] leaped from the cannon, crossed over the soldiers,
1:7:58|1:8:9|Arriving in front of [Fang Zijing], the soldiers reacted quickly, holding their spears and thrusting them towards [Chen Changxing]. [Chen Changxing] immediately grabbed [Fang Zijing]'s collar and spun in place, kicking away all the spears thrust at him.
1:8:9|1:8:19|When the soldiers had not reacted, [Chen Changxing] acupunctured the row of soldiers closest to him in the encirclement, and the spear was inserted into the gaps in their bodies. At this moment, [Fang Zijing] was sweating profusely.
1:8:19|1:8:33|As he found that this row of soldiers not only couldn't move, but also blocked a large number of reinforcements behind them, this open space at this moment seemed to become the duel ground for the two. Just as [Fang Zijing] nervously paced back and forth, the husband and wife flew into the encirclement from outside the crowd.
1:8:35|1:8:46|Chen Changxing pushed out several punches in a row, and Fang Zijing stood like a stake letting himself be slaughtered. Then Chen Changxing exerted all his strength, and with one punch, Fang Zijing was sent flying out of the crowd.
1:8:53|1:9:1|The officials and soldiers who broke out of the encirclement rushed towards the three like fierce beasts, but in the eyes of the three, such attacks seemed fierce but full of flaws.
1:9:1|1:9:13|With only their agile pushing hands, the three managed to break through the encirclement. However, even with this divine skill, they found themselves in a fierce battle against spears coming from all directions without any pattern. After half a day of rest, Fang Zijing also recovered.
1:9:16|1:9:29|He snatched the musket from the soldier's hand, stood on a high place, aimed at [Chen Yuniang] in the crowd, but hesitated as she was his former lover. After a moment of hesitation, he turned the gun towards [Yang Luchan]. Upon seeing this, [Chen Changxing] quickly shouted,
1:9:30|1:9:39|Just as [Fang Zijing] was about to pull the trigger, a loud roar of engines came from the sky, before anyone could see clearly, several shells fell from the air.
1:9:40|1:10:2|Yes, it was [Chen Zaiyang] who drove the Tianwei Wing to come to the rescue. The shells projected by the Tianwei Wing exploded the soldiers into disarray, causing a large number of them to fall. The remaining soldiers were also in a panic, not knowing what to do. The soldiers on the ground no longer had the heart to fight the three of them, but kept looking up at the sky. At this moment, the Tianwei Wing that attracted everyone's attention soared into the sky and disappeared from people's sight.
1:10:2|1:10:8|Just when everyone thought it was over, Tianweiyi unexpectedly circled back from behind and launched a counterattack.
1:10:18|1:10:25|After a round of shooting that didn't harm Tianwei Yi at all, [Fang Zijing] angrily threw away the musket and said to the artillery,
1:10:26|1:10:43|After receiving orders, the artillerymen quickly climbed onto the cannon to load the shells. Chen Zaiyang saw the enemy setting up the cannon, so he turned the handle and shot out the homemade bullets, causing the soldiers holding long spears to fall like lambs to the slaughter, powerless to fight back.
1:10:43|1:10:53|At this moment, [Chen Changxing] looked at the Tianwei Wings soaring freely in the sky, unable to speak for a long time. Meanwhile, [Chen Zaiyang] continued to bombard downwards to cover the retreat of the three.
1:10:54|1:11:10|[Fang Zijing] saw the Heavenly Wing swiftly flying past the crowd, then commanded the artillery again. When [Chen Changxing] saw the Heavenly Wing diving towards the crowd, he shouted loudly,
1:11:12|1:11:21|At this moment, the cannon has also turned around and adjusted its height to aim at Tianwei Wing. Fortunately, Chen Zaiyang agilely dodged and avoided the cannonball. After dealing with the soldiers in front of him, Chen Changxing turned to his husband.
1:11:23|1:11:28|The two wives said that they seized the opportunity and rushed towards the weakest point in the defense of the soldiers.
1:11:31|1:11:34|At this moment, the Tianwei Wing in the sky suddenly changed its flying posture from before to a sideways flight.
1:11:34|1:11:47|The huge wings glided along the ground. After a moment, they arrived behind the two, and as the wings slid between [Yang Luchan] and [Chen Yuniang], the two leaped precisely and grabbed the wings steadily. The numerous soldiers could only watch as the two flew past them.
1:11:47|1:11:55|Unable to leave, [Fang Zijing] was furious at the sight. He did not allow such a thing to happen, so he shouted to his men,
1:11:56|1:12:11|[Fang Zijing] took the gun and aimed at several people. However, [Chen Zaiyang] loudly taunted, and then threw the last specially customized shell for [Fang Zijing], which, after flipping in the air for several rounds, landed accurately in front of [Fang Zijing].
1:12:11|1:12:25|When he realized he wanted to run, it was already too late. [Fang Zijing], who was blown away, lay unconscious on the ground, while the three people on the Tianwei wings soared freely in the sky, flying further and further away. [Chen Changxing] breathed a sigh of relief after seeing the three of them escape.
1:12:25|1:12:35|Facing the remaining remnants of the enemy, if he were to escape at this moment, no one could stop him. However, for the sake of the villagers in the village, he chose not to resist and was captured.
1:12:35|1:12:48|At this moment, the couple [Yang Luchan] on the wing is also facing difficulties, as the strong airflow from high-speed flight makes it difficult for them to move. Just then, the Tianwei Wing, which was flying steadily just now, suddenly becomes unstable.
1:12:48|1:13:12|Chen Zaiyang, upon discovering the anomaly of the Tianwei Wing, supported himself with mechanical armor to maintain balance. The two on the wing also seized the opportunity and held onto the railing tightly, as the Tianwei Wing seemed to reach its limit. Chen Zaiyang, seeing frequent issues with the mechanical parts, shouted loudly,
1:13:22|1:13:32|After speaking, [Chen Zaiyang] unexpectedly leaped without hesitation and jumped off the Tianwei Wing. Falling from this kilometer-high sky, even a great immortal would not be able to escape death.
1:13:33|1:13:39|Just as the two looked on in despair at the sacrifice of their eldest brother, [Chen Zaiyang] forcefully pulled off the iron ring on his chest.
1:13:39|1:13:50|A large parachute suddenly rose up. [Chen Zaiyang], although saved his life, dozens of soldiers were already waiting for his landing below. After landing, facing the encirclement, [Chen Zaiyang] just set up a fighting stance, but
1:13:50|1:14:0|Covered by the parachute on his head, the officials rushed forward and started punching and kicking [Chen Zaiyang]. Meanwhile, in the capital city, foreigners were taking photos for Prince Bei.
1:14:1|1:14:12|The flash of the camera was so bright that it made the prince unable to open his eyes. The foreigner noticed that the prince had his eyes closed in the photo, so he said to the prince's men,
1:14:23|1:14:32|After pondering for a moment, Prince Bei not only did not get angry, but burst into laughter.
1:14:45|1:14:54|At this moment, a minister hurriedly walked up to [Chen Youzhi] and whispered something in his ear.
1:15:5|1:15:17|After sending off the minister, [Chen Youzhi] turned to [Prince Bei] and humorously remarked that both he and Master Li closed their eyes together.
1:15:18|1:15:23|Returning to Chen Family Valley once again, after [Chen Changxing] was taken away, Duke [Fei Linming] also arrived in a carriage.
1:15:24|1:15:37|Duke [Fei Linming] walked into a simple wooden shed under the guidance of the soldiers. [Fang Zijing], covered in wounds, lay gasping for breath on a bench. Despite his tattered official attire and disheveled appearance, his expression remained full of anger.
1:15:52|1:15:58|At the same time, in the neighboring village, Tianweiyi fell on the roof, while [Yang Luchan] and [Chen Yuniang] hid in the stable on the side.
1:16:1|1:16:10|Listening to Chen Yuniang's question, Yang Luchan couldn't come up with a good solution for a moment. Just then, a horse stuck its head in front of the two, and after glancing at the horse, Yang Luchan smirked mischievously at Chen Yuniang.
1:16:12|1:16:30|So [Yang Luchan] mounted his horse, taking [Chen Yuniang] with him, and galloped non-stop towards the capital city, bearing a heavy responsibility. Despite their exhaustion, they did not rest at all, knowing that they were the hope of the entire village. In the evening, in the prison, the jailer pushed [Chen Zaiyang] in.
1:16:44|1:17:2|After being pushed to the ground, [Chen Zaiyang] stood up and shouted angrily. As he turned around to finish his sentence, he saw his father [Chen Changxing] meditating with his eyes closed. Seeing his father, [Chen Zaiyang] instinctively lowered his head and moved to the corner, feeling scared and guilty. At this moment, [Chen Changxing] spoke,
1:17:6|1:17:14|[Chen Zaiyang], who was already accustomed to such lessons, said,
1:17:30|1:17:39|[Chen Zaiyang] looked at his father in disbelief as he heard these words. [Chen Changxing] said sincerely,
1:18:32|1:18:50|Chen Changxing angrily threw the torn paper on the ground, with the words "Heavenly Wing" still visible on the broken paper. Chen Zaiyang tremblingly picked up the debris from the ground, slowly stood up, and looked at Chen Changxing with a heart as lifeless as ashes.
1:18:53|1:19:8|[Chen Zaiyang] looked at the person who had ruined his own dreams, backing away while saying, then he roared and ran towards the courtyard. Seeing this, [Chen Changxing] also realized that his words were too harsh. He looked at his son's figure, feeling a bit at a loss for a moment.
1:19:8|1:19:17|Chen Changxing, who has always been strict, did not catch up. In the prison, Chen Changxing said from the bottom of his heart,
1:19:22|1:19:33|He looked at his tearful son in front of him and called out softly. After that, [Chen Changxing] slowly reached out his hands towards his son, and [Chen Zaiyang] happily rushed forward to hold them.
1:19:34|1:19:46|At the moment when their hands touched, [Chen Zaiyang] could no longer hide the grievance in his heart. He cried loudly on his father's chest, after so many years of effort and perseverance, he finally gained his father's approval in this moment.
1:19:47|1:19:52|At this moment, even the stern Chen Changxing couldn't help but shed tears in his eyes after decades of strictness.
1:19:55|1:20:5|In the bustling capital city, the streets and alleys are full of prosperity, with numerous shops of all sizes and a constant stream of customers. Despite bearing heavy responsibilities, [Chen Changxing] is...
1:20:6|1:20:19|But seeing this scene, [Chen Changxing] couldn't help but look around. At this moment, a large crowd gathered in front of the billboard in front of [Chen Changxing], and he curiously went forward to check. However, when he reached the front, he found that the wanted poster of the couple was posted on the billboard.
1:20:19|1:20:31|Seeing this situation, [Chen Changxing] knew that time was running out. Following previous instructions, he arrived at the luxurious and exquisite clock shop of the Bagua Sect's head, [Chen Changxing] paused for a moment in front of the shop's decoration, then walked in.
1:20:31|1:20:41|At this moment, the shopkeeper was concentrating on repairing the pocket watch on the quiet second floor. Soon, the waiter who learned about the couple's intentions hurriedly ran up.
1:20:51|1:21:6|After speaking, the shopkeeper handed over the token entrusted to Chen Changxing to Yang Luchan with both hands. Seeing this token, the shopkeeper immediately put down the tools in his hands, went downstairs with the waiter, and said,
1:21:19|1:21:32|[Yang Luchan] finished speaking and assumed a stance. [Chen Changxing] was ready for the duel, tension mounting. As the leader of the Duizi style, he possessed profound skills and vast experience in battles. Just by observing the calm and composed posture of [Yang Luchan], it was evident that he was no ordinary opponent.
1:21:32|1:21:40|He hesitated to make a move for a long time, but after observing for a while, he struck with a palm strike. However, [Yang Luchan] instantly dodged and counterattacked by hitting his ribs, pushing the master away.
1:21:40|1:21:57|Unexpectedly, before the sect leader could stabilize, he swiftly struck towards the chest of [Yang Luchan]. Unable to dodge in time, [Yang Luchan] leaned back, using the internal strength of [Chen Family Fist] to dissipate the force of the blow. Then, in quick succession, a strike leveraging force against force pushed the sect leader back several meters. With the exchange of blows between experts, the outcome was already clear at this point.
1:22:9|1:22:21|As the head of the Duizi sect said, the Bagua sect has eight sect leaders. In addition to the Duizi sect leader, there are also seven other sect leaders, namely the Qianzi, Kanzi, Genzi, Zhenzi, Xunzi, Lizi, and Kunzi sect leaders.
1:22:21|1:22:35|Following the guidance of the leader of the Duizi sect, [Yang Luchan] went to seek advice with the Bagua Disc in hand, in order to meet the Grand Master [Master Li]. Upon learning of [Yang Luchan]'s purpose, the other seven sect leaders all displayed their unique skills and treated him with respect.
1:22:35|1:22:43|These eight sect leaders, although from the same school, have vastly different martial arts techniques, ranging from extreme yin to extreme yang, each unique in their own way. Some are extremely domineering, while others hide a knife behind their smiles.
1:22:45|1:22:52|Even so, in front of the [Chen Family Fist] that [Yang Luchan] comprehended with great care, these ever-changing moves were as simple as child's play. After a round of sparring, these accomplished sect leaders who could stand on their own were completely outmatched.
1:22:54|1:23:6|Not only did [Yang Luchan] not harm a hair on him, but he also held back in every move. [Yang Luchan] displayed the essence of Chinese martial arts to the fullest, and even the onlookers applauded enthusiastically.
1:23:6|1:23:19|After defeating the head of the Kanzi sect, [Yang Luchan] successfully advanced to the seventh level. At this moment, in the kitchen of Prince Bei's mansion, the soldiers sent by [Master Li] to observe secretly arrived to deliver a message. Master Li, who was supervising the kitchen, had his back to the door.
1:23:50|1:23:57|As Headmaster Liu was about to fall heavily from the second floor, [Yang Luchan] quickly steadied him.
1:24:1|1:24:10|After Master Liu finished speaking, he took [Yang Luchan] and his wife to Prince Bei's mansion. Master Li led the two of them all the way to the kitchen and said to them,
1:24:32|1:24:39|In the midst of the conversation, a chef turned around with a plate, and [Master Li] swiftly dodged to the side and agilely slid in front of him.
1:24:57|1:25:9|[Master Li] continued to move forward without saying a word. Although he was a prominent figure by the prince's side, the matter at hand was of great importance, making it difficult for him to intervene. Seeing [Master Li] constantly shuttling back and forth in the kitchen, [Yang Luchan] and [Chen Yuniang] knelt down anxiously and greeted him with clasped hands.
1:25:9|1:25:23|When they looked up, they found [Master Li] kneeling on the ground in the same posture, but the person he was kneeling to was Prince Bei on the second floor. When the prince came out, [Master Li] confidently said,
1:25:32|1:25:46|Prince Bei did not immediately respond after hearing it. Instead, he slowly raised his noble hand, palm facing upwards, lightly flicked his four fingers, and said, "After hearing the voice of the prince, everyone in the kitchen immediately bent over and stood up straight."
1:26:35|1:26:44|[Yang Luchan] just with a bow, quietly took the sesame cake on the table in front of everyone. The prince was very satisfied with this response and said,
1:27:1|1:27:16|Training is not a problem, but [Chen Yuniang] looked at the compactly arranged kitchen with boilers and tables and chairs, feeling puzzled. After looking around, she asked in confusion, while [Yang Luchan] had just turned around to follow [Li Qiankun], [Chen Yuniang] anxiously grabbed his wrist.
1:27:25|1:27:37|Li Qiankun walked towards the stairs, his hands covered in white flour. When he reached the middle of the stairs, he suddenly jumped onto the handrail, using his superb lightness skill to step on the wooden screen between the boilers. The screen was originally used to separate the boilers.
1:27:37|1:27:52|The width of the screen is only slightly wider than three fingers, making it difficult for ordinary people to stand upright, let alone compete here. In the short time, Yang Luchan has already quietly eaten up all the sesame cakes he stole. Seeing Li Qiankun set up his posture, he also stepped onto the screen.
1:27:52|1:28:2|We see that [Yang Luchan]'s lightness skill is on par with [Li Qiankun], with the screen under his feet slightly swaying, but his upper body remains motionless, as steady as Mount Tai. In the blink of an eye, he circles around [Li Qiankun] on the screen.
1:28:4|1:28:13|Standing in front and assuming a stance. [Li Qiankun] looked at [Yang Luchan]'s skills, very satisfied, just about to make a move, but found that there was no movement under his feet, dozens of chefs all looked up and watched the two.
1:28:28|1:28:44|After staring at each other for a long time, [Li Qiankun] couldn't hold back and made the first move. His hands crossed in front of him in a feigned attack, and the next second he kicked [Yang Luchan] on the shoulder with a swift step. Seeing [Yang Luchan] withstand his kick and still stand on the screen, [Li Qiankun] immediately followed up with a direct strike to the face, continuing the attack.
1:29:4|1:29:15|After a moment, the two of them seized the opportunity and each struck a palm towards the other's chest, causing both of them to fly backwards instantly. After flying back to their original positions and circulating their qi in the dantian, this first round of probing finally came to an end.
1:29:19|1:29:28|The prince upstairs praised, and at this moment, Li Qiankun changed his posture and made another move. Li Qiankun, who had previously gained some insights from Chen Ersao's boxing, intended to use Chen-style boxing against Yang Luchan.
1:29:28|1:29:40|The two have identical body movements, techniques, attacks, and defenses, making it difficult to distinguish between them for a moment. Both of them have also comprehended the essence of [Chen Family Fist] and the integration of martial arts with natural living. Just like the fish simmering in the oil at this moment,
1:29:40|1:29:52|The two on the screen are spinning and making their moves again. [Li Qiankun], as an outsider, has only had a few exchanges and already grasped the essence of the [Chen Family Fist]. Although he did not manage to harm [Yang Luchan], [Li Qiankun] also successfully neutralized all of [Yang Luchan]'s attacks.
1:29:52|1:30:2|[Yang Luchan]'s covering hand punch was easily resolved by [Li Qiankun]'s push hands, and immediately followed by a single whip. Before [Yang Luchan] could finish defending, [Li Qiankun] executed a white crane spreads its wings sweeping strike.
1:30:2|1:30:18|[Yang Luchan] dodged in time, but was still caught off guard. Just as [Li Qiankun] made his move, [Yang Luchan] found an opening and nearly kicked [Li Qiankun] off the screen with a whirlwind kick. Fortunately, [Li Qiankun] had an incredibly stable lower body, and he quickly extended his leg back onto the screen.
1:30:19|1:30:27|The two of them then exchanged palm strikes again and flew backwards. In the midst of skilled martial artists in the capital city, [Li Qiankun], who was firmly seated in the top position, held his ground for several rounds.
1:30:27|1:30:37|Although neither was at a disadvantage nor gained any advantage. Just as the two separated to gather their energy, the sweet and sour carp under their feet happened to be ready, filling the entire kitchen with its tempting aroma.
1:30:38|1:30:51|[Yang Luchan] couldn't help but swallow after hearing it, and after being reprimanded by [Chen Yuniang], [Yang Luchan] refocused his attention on the martial arts. At this moment, it seemed as if he had grasped the principle of the interdependence of all things. To others, he appeared to be standing still.
1:30:51|1:31:3|Only he himself could see the scene of the two of them fighting next with his heart. After a few rounds of fighting, [Li Qiankun]'s moves were also seen through by [Yang Luchan] for the most part. After a while, he finally saw a way to defeat [Li Qiankun].
1:31:4|1:31:17|Upstairs, Prince Bei watched the two men who hesitated to make a move with confusion, but as a spectator, he did not speak to disturb. After a moment, Yang Luchan, who was integrated with his energy, stood on the screen with one foot and transformed into a wedge shape with the moves of the Vajra pounding hammer.
1:31:18|1:31:26|Li Qiankun saw the opponent changing moves, and he also prepared a response. This time, Yang Luchan took the lead and rushed towards Li Qiankun. Just as he was about to make a move, Yang Luchan suddenly changed direction.
1:31:28|1:31:39|Flying to the left side behind [Li Qiankun], a swift airborne kick directly hits [Li Qiankun]'s face, catching him off guard. Without panicking, [Li Qiankun] swiftly dodges and retaliates with a Cloud Hands strike aimed at the vital point.
1:31:39|1:31:51|[Yang Luchan] did not evade this move, spinning several times in the air. But as soon as he landed, he was caught off guard by the experienced [Li Qiankun], who delivered a hammer strike to his ear. [Li Qiankun] thought this strike would surely hit, but to his surprise, [Yang Luchan] suddenly moved like water.
1:31:51|1:32:5|The carp is agile like, with a soft waist and abdomen making it easy to dodge. Just as [Li Qiankun] was surprised, [Yang Luchan] struck towards his abdomen with a palm, leaving [Li Qiankun] unable to evade in time. Unexpectedly, [Yang Luchan] suddenly pulled back, then leveraged the force to spin in the air.
1:32:5|1:32:17|During the reversal, [Yang Luchan] dipped his hands in the flour on his chest and struck [Li Qiankun] in the chest. Next, the unstoppable [Yang Luchan], who had grasped the truth, countered every move with ease, neutralizing all of [Li Qiankun]'s attacks.
1:32:17|1:32:24|Instead, [Yang Luchan] began to hold back again. After [Yang Luchan] lightly pushed a palm, the two of them regained their strength, and at this moment, the sound of bells rang under their feet.
1:33:50|1:33:59|The prince asked Yang Luchan after hearing this.
1:34:18|1:34:26|Having defeated [Li Qiankun] and gained the approval of [Prince Bei], the happy couple embraced each other excitedly.
1:34:53|1:35:11|Father and son walked up the mountain in tattered clothes to [Chen Family Valley], and the people who had received the news had already gathered at the mountaintop to welcome them. Seeing their father and elder brother safe and sound despite their disheveled appearance, the children and villagers couldn't hide their joy. When [Chen Changxing] saw his children and the elders again, his eyes became moist.
1:35:11|1:35:19|The affectionate couple [Chen Zaiyang] and his wife were in tears as they embraced each other. Just as the whole family was immersed in the atmosphere of reunion, the little girl shouted to everyone,
