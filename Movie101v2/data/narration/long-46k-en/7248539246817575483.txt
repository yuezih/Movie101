0:0:21|0:0:34|In the misty morning, a galloping horse approaches. [Yanzi Li San], dressed in night clothes, throws a small cloth bag to the ground and quickly turns away. A ragged child runs over quickly to pick it up.
0:0:55|0:1:5|The poor people flooded the streets to express their gratitude for the hero's generosity. As night fell, a masked man rode a horse to the front of a house, then suddenly leaped and flew into the courtyard.
0:1:21|0:1:38|Upon hearing the shout, the masked man burst in through the door. Inside the room, He Laoda was bullying a young girl. The masked man, upon seeing this, loudly threatened. He Laoda immediately stood up upon seeing the masked man. He Laoda promptly pushed the girl towards [Yanzi Li San].
0:1:42|0:1:57|Seeing the other party fleeing towards the door, [Yanzi Li San] nodded to the good girl and chased after, kicking He Laoda down with one foot. The girl in the room saw the sachet dropped by [Yanzi Li San] and fell into contemplation. The guards outside the door rushed in, but were all knocked down by [Yanzi Li San]. Later, [Yanzi Li San] found He Laoda.
0:2:13|0:2:30|[Yanzi Li San] stepped on He Laoda's chest, causing him to immediately feel a sharp pain and spit out blood. In the quiet moonlight, a brush danced lightly on the wall, gradually forming the image of a swallow. The title "Master Thief [Yanzi Li San]" appeared on the screen.
0:2:38|0:2:53|Four guards swung their big knives towards [Yanzi Li San], striking fiercely and swiftly. He threw a punch, striking at his opponent, blocking the first two knives. Before he could react, the other two guards attacked from behind, aiming at his face. Seizing the opportunity, he leaped like a flying bird, dodging the blades.
0:2:53|0:2:56|After creating some distance from the opponent, [Yanzi Li San] displayed his lightness skill and charged towards the isolated thug.
0:2:57|0:3:16|With a leg sweep, like a heavy whip strike, directly hitting the opponent's chest, each strike more powerful than the last, as hard as steel, forcing the opponent to retreat continuously. The opponent, who had been knocked down several times, gradually couldn't keep up with the defense, stepping back until he met his flying kick again, his body flying backwards and crashing directly into a row of bamboo poles behind him.
0:3:16|0:3:21|At this moment, a thug ran out from the backyard and, seeing his companion on the ground, immediately rushed towards [Yanzi Li San].
0:3:22|0:3:31|The two of them maintained a tacit understanding as they distanced themselves, disdainful of the leg techniques. [Yanzi Li San] continuously changed angles, countering the opponent's moves until finding a loophole, then kicking heavily towards the opponent's foot.
0:3:36|0:3:48|Seeing the thug pounce towards him, [Yanzi Li San] immediately dodged, avoiding his attack. His left foot viciously kicked towards the thug's right foot as he advanced, but the thug couldn't dodge in time and was kicked in the chest by [Yanzi Li San]'s straight leg, causing him to be knocked over due to the shift in his center of gravity.
0:3:48|0:3:54|Seeing the situation turning bad, Yanzi Li San immediately rolled to the scattered bamboo poles and picked one up as a weapon.
0:4:0|0:4:17|Upon hearing this, the thug instantly turned ferocious and charged forward, engaging in a fierce fight. [Yanzi Li San] utilized his agility and techniques to swiftly evade the opponent's attacks, while launching sharp counterattacks. His figure moved like a swallow, swiftly weaving between the opponent's strikes, constantly seeking openings.
0:4:17|0:4:23|The thug, taking advantage of the longer bamboo stick, continuously strikes at the legs of [Yanzi Li San], attempting to knock down the opponent in this way.
0:4:24|0:4:34|Under the fierce attack of the thugs, [Yanzi Li San] refused to back down, picked up a big knife, and swung it towards the thug's waist. The thug quickly reacted, dodging [Yanzi Li San]'s deadly blow with a swift turn.
0:4:34|0:4:43|In the midst of the ordinary back-and-forth, the henchmen had no chance to approach [Yanzi Li San]. Instead, the weapon, a bamboo pole, which gained an advantage halfway through, was cut in half by [Yanzi Li San]'s big knife with a crack.
0:4:46|0:5:2|His eyes flashed with ferocity, gritting his teeth, tightly gripping the bamboo pole, he shouted fiercely and charged towards [Yanzi Li San] once again. The two of them wrestled together again, the big knife and the bamboo pole constantly making clashing sounds. In this cold and silent night, it sounded particularly harsh.
0:5:2|0:5:10|In several rounds of fighting, the actions of the thug became slow due to exhaustion, clearly unable to withstand the increasingly fierce attacks from [Yanzi Li San].
0:5:11|0:5:28|[Yanzi Li San] took advantage of the thug's distraction, quickly circled behind him, raised his big knife, and chopped towards his back. The thug's coat was cut open, revealing the already sweat-soaked undershirt. Despite having the upper hand, [Yanzi Li San] did not relax his vigilance against his opponent who had been slashed, and continued to press the attack.
0:5:28|0:5:41|The old man hiding outside the door, his hand gripping the door frame tightly, nervously and anxiously watching the fight in the courtyard. [Yanzi Li San]'s agile knife skills picked out multiple holes in the opponent's coat, enraging the thug who instantly pounced.
0:5:41|0:5:50|Just as the two were fighting fiercely, a person sneaked out from the backyard hugging a package, afraid of being discovered by [Yanzi Li San], sneaking along the wall towards the door.
0:5:51|0:6:6|[Yanzi Li San] caught a glimpse of the Black Boss from the corner of his eye, afraid that the other party might escape. He immediately accelerated his attacks on the henchmen who were obstructing him. Rising up and spinning with a double kick, followed by a 360-degree aerial spin kick, he directly knocked the henchman to the ground with a tornado kick, leaving him unable to get up.
0:6:6|0:6:16|Yanzi Li San kicked him to the ground, then kicked the silver ticket in his hand into the stove. The leader of the black gang ran into the lamp held by Yanzi Li San's Yue Bu Zheng, immediately backing away repeatedly.
0:6:23|0:6:35|The henchman who was just knocked down heard the instructions from the boss and immediately got up to run towards the main house to unlock the chains.
0:6:43|0:7:10|The ragged old man holding his granddaughter approached [Yanzi Li San]. On the road outside the river, people hurriedly rushed, refugees and injured soldiers on the carriage struggled to move forward. A soldier with a wounded right leg walked with a crutch along the crowd, suddenly, the limping soldier stumbled and fell to the ground.
0:7:33|0:7:43|Seeing the pedestrians indifferent, Yanzi Li San had to search on himself, only to find nothing. He then gave his only crutch to the old man.
0:7:47|0:8:2|The soldier with a missing leg forcefully shoved a crutch into the hands of the old man, a scene observed by the young man dressed in splendid attire riding a spirited horse. After the soldier with a missing leg left, the young man took out a bag of silver from his embrace, threw it next to the old man, and rode away.
0:8:2|0:8:9|In the noisy street, the young man who had just done a good deed was handing out candies to the children, when a man beside him was pushed and bumped into the young man.
0:8:11|0:8:31|Yanzi Li San stopped the young beggar, who nervously turned around. The beggar checked his money pouch after Yanzi Li San walked away, only to find a pile of stones inside. As the beggar looked back in confusion, he saw the real money pouch in the hands of Jin Lan.
0:8:39|0:8:45|The young beggar looked around but couldn't see the young man's figure. In the market, the limping soldier handed out the gun.
0:8:58|0:9:1|Faced with the other party's attitude, [Yanzi Li San] had no choice but to kneel down.
0:9:20|0:9:32|The human trafficker contemptuously flicked away the cigarette butt and walked away. At this moment, a young man walked out from the crowd and spoke slowly. Hearing someone speak, [Yanzi Li San] looked towards the person. Seeing [Yanzi Li San] raise his head, the young man angrily shouted.
0:9:41|0:9:45|The young man threw the money bag in front of [Yanzi Li San], and [Yanzi Li San] slowly picked up the money bag.
0:9:51|0:9:55|After speaking, Yanzi Li San turned and walked away. After speaking, Yanzi Li San turned and walked away. After speaking, Yanzi Li San turned and walked away.
0:10:17|0:10:19|A man enters the restaurant.
0:10:51|0:11:3|Yanzi Li San was reciting poetry to himself. Jin Lan, accompanied by his men, walked straight to the young man's table and sat down without waiting for an invitation.
0:11:14|0:11:16|The man looked up and asked his subordinate.
0:12:39|0:12:56|At the urging of the shopkeeper, Xiao Er brought a jar of wine. The young man picked up the wine jar leisurely, brought it to his nose and sniffed. He put it back on the table, lit the mouth of the bottle with a match, and Xiao Er understood that he was going to pour the wine. At that moment, he secretly picked up a peanut, aimed at the wine jar and shot it with force. The exploding wine jar caught the attention of Yanzi Li San.
0:13:37|0:13:50|In the bustling street, a large army marched in a grand and imposing manner, causing people to involuntarily make way to the sides, creating a passage. The soldiers in uniform walked silently, with no extra expression on their faces.
0:13:51|0:14:1|At the forefront of the team, a military officer in uniform rides a tall steed, head held high, eyes fixed on the pedestrians ahead, exuding confidence and dignity on his face.
0:14:1|0:14:9|Passersby on the roadside stopped one after another, watching the spectacular scene. Some people waved their hands in greeting, and the leader at the front nodded to the passersby.
0:14:15|0:14:23|The young man heard the sound of Captain Tang chasing after him, and could only helplessly run forward. Suddenly, he saw the figures of the army in front of him, and made a decision as he looked at the approaching troops.
0:14:26|0:14:36|He leaped forward and landed in the middle of the leader's horse group. Before the opponent could react, he struck the horse's hindquarters with force, causing the horse to be startled and become restless.
0:14:36|0:14:46|The street suddenly became chaotic, with people scrambling to avoid being trampled by the horses. The young boy was unfortunately pushed to the front by the horses, and [Yanzi Li San] picked him up and moved him out of the way.
0:14:51|0:14:59|The young man took the boy and walked away, leaving the beggar across the street observing everything. Captain Tang hurriedly ran towards the leader. The young man was discovered when he hid in the alley.
0:15:21|0:15:35|A group of soldiers with guns stopped at the alley entrance for a blockade, with Yanzi Li San leading the way. He cautiously moved forward with his gun raised, followed closely by Jin Lan. Around the corner, a gate blocked the path of the group.
0:15:44|0:15:50|At night, Captain Tang led a group of followers who were bowing respectfully, riding bicycles, and arrived in a dusty manner.
0:16:5|0:16:16|A sedan drove up and stopped in front of everyone. The person in the passenger seat got out and opened the back door, from which [Jin Lan] emerged. Captain Tang quickly took off his hat and went forward to greet [Jin Lan].
0:16:36|0:16:39|A person suddenly jumped out in the courtyard, blocking the way of everyone.
0:16:59|0:17:20|The servant, helpless, could only keep an eye on [Jin Lan]. [Jin Lan] ignored the speaking servant and walked towards the living room on her own. The attendant quickly wiped the dusty chair clean with his sleeve. After sitting down, [Jin Lan] looked around from time to time, with a serious expression.
0:17:29|0:17:35|The servant nervously glanced at the plaque above the living room, which read "Knowledge brings joy".
0:17:50|0:17:54|After confirming that [Jin Lan] has left, Madam slowly spoke.
0:18:3|0:18:21|The young man gently placed the plaque on the ground and peeked out. Seeing Zhang Lu making a move, the young man used the plaque to defend himself, taking the opportunity to kick hard at the opponent's chest. Zhang Lu kept retreating, and when he saw the young man preparing to attack again, the young man immediately raised the plaque above his head. Feeling that he had caught the opponent's weak spot, the young man pretended to smash the plaque to scare the opponent.
0:18:21|0:18:41|Yanzi Li San dared not act rashly when he saw Zhang Lu, throwing the plaque on the ground and sliding out the door with his foot on the plaque. Haibian was kicked back to Zhang Lu. The young man disappeared into the night after hearing the language three times. In a large courtyard, actors were performing on stage, and the audience was also excited.
0:18:41|0:18:45|The guests went to respectfully greet the old man sitting in the middle.
0:18:48|0:19:5|[Captain Tang] moved through the lively banquet with a serious expression, vigilantly looking around and engaging briefly with the guests. He headed towards the bottom of the west platform, trying to identify any suspicious traces, observing the expressions and actions of everyone.
0:19:5|0:19:10|After making sure there was no danger, Yanzi Li San turned around and walked towards a group of followers, who quickly approached him.
0:19:48|0:19:51|Zhang Lu respectfully presented the gift after hearing it.
0:20:5|0:20:8|After reading the letter, [Yanzi Li San] looked up in surprise. [Jin Lan] awkwardly wiped the sweat off his forehead.
0:20:52|0:20:59|Zhang Lu took the returned gift after the other party's direct refusal. At this moment, a guest entered from outside the door.
0:21:19|0:21:25|Upon seeing the gift from Xiaoliyuan, Commander Ma was momentarily stunned. Young Master had a proud look on his face.
0:21:43|0:22:9|The maid standing aside stepped forward to receive the gift. Xiaoliyuan followed Chinese etiquette and bowed in return. Inside the room, only the young master had no seat. Commander Ma held a calling card but couldn't remember if he knew this person. The young man in a suit swaggered in.
0:23:43|0:23:47|After the young man greeted the commander with a fake name, he pretended to stroll around the stage, but in fact, he was observing the layout of the courtyard.
0:24:11|0:24:18|He found the courtyard seemingly lively, but actually heavily guarded, with Tang Captain's followers and Young Marshal's men in every corner.
0:24:18|0:24:31|On stage, Yanzi Li San, dressed as a beautiful huadan, wearing a flower crown and gorgeous clothes, holding a short gun in one hand and wearing embroidered shoes, gracefully raised the short gun in her hand, her colorful steps synchronized with the music of Peking Opera.
0:24:31|0:24:47|He spun around for a while, making various movements, with even his stopping posture being exquisite, drawing cheers from the audience. The young man was captivated by the girl on stage, but soon he recognized her - the leading actress was the girl he had saved from Boss He.
0:24:47|0:25:6|Seeing the other party safe and sound, Yanzi Li San turned and walked towards the audience. Jin Lan suddenly appeared in front of him. Catching a glimpse of Captain Tang walking towards the crowd, Yanzi Li San had to immediately turn and leave, while Captain Tang headed towards the mesmerized Jin Lan in the audience. Seeing Jin Lan captivated by the actress on stage, Captain Tang spoke up.
0:25:23|0:25:31|The young man hid behind a tree, avoiding the patrolling soldiers. When the soldiers moved away, he quickly leaped onto the branches, moving lightly and swiftly among them.
0:25:31|0:25:44|Shortly after, another group of soldiers patrolled by. After they left, the young man changed into the night clothes hidden in the tree, his face wrapped in cloth, only revealing a pair of eyes. He jumped off the tree trunk and quietly followed the soldiers to a small house in the backyard.
0:25:45|0:26:2|He held his breath, staring at [Yanzi Li San]. With the protection of the soldiers, the young man unlocked the door skillfully. His lightness skills were exceptional, and his movements went unnoticed by the young leader guarding the door. Once inside the room, the young man quickly leaped onto the roof, gently pushing aside the tiles to reveal the scene inside the house.
0:26:2|0:26:20|Xiaoshuai opened the mechanism on the wall and entered another room. His view was blocked, but he did not see the hidden chamber behind the calligraphy and painting hanging on the wall. After Xiaoshuai left with the box, Xiaohuo quickly jumped into the room, found the secret compartment, pushed aside the shelf, entered the hidden chamber, and put the valuable items into the package.
0:26:20|0:26:30|He operated carefully, afraid of alerting others. Over in the living room, Yanzi Li San brought the treasure back to the main house, and everyone gathered around to take a look.
0:26:35|0:26:46|After Young Master Chao Pu showed off, he rolled up his sleeves, gently revealed the treasure wrapped in Hanoi cloth, slowly untied the small knots on top, and then presented the precious jade to everyone.
0:27:5|0:27:16|The young man, carrying a package full of treasures, came out from the second floor of the treasure house. He then displayed his light skills and leaped down, landing softly. Just as he was about to leave, a group of soldiers rushed out from the nearby small house.
0:27:36|0:27:50|The young man made a handcuffed posture, and the follower tried to take him down but was thrown down by him. His companion immediately fired a gun, and the young man seized the opponent's pistol, pulled the trigger, and the soldier who reacted slowly was hit.
0:27:54|0:28:9|In the reception room, after [Yanzi Li San] instructed someone to protect her father, she hurried towards the treasure pavilion. Meanwhile, as the bullets ran out, Captain Tang lunged at the young man trying to catch him barehanded. The young man skillfully countered each move. On the side, the attendants saw that the two were evenly matched and did not dare to intervene.
0:28:10|0:28:27|Standing in a wall-like formation, blocking the young man's retreat. The young man used his skilled leg techniques to kick down Captain Tang. As Captain Tang fell to the ground, he immediately grabbed the young man's legs and pulled forcefully. The young man, unstable due to gravity, fell to the ground. After realizing this, he immediately flipped over and leaped up by inertia.
0:28:27|0:28:37|The followers saw the boss being knocked down to the ground, Yanzi Li San bravely rushed towards the young man, who was outnumbered. The young man immediately changed tactics, pulled up the fallen Captain Tang, and pointed a gun at the opponent's head.
0:28:47|0:29:0|Seeing Captain Tang speak, everyone could only bow their heads and crouch down, while the young man instantly jumped out of the courtyard. After the follower finished speaking, Captain Tang slowly looked back to make sure the young man had left.
0:29:14|0:29:36|Not far away, [Yanzi Li San] ran over with a group of soldiers. [Captain Tang] led his men to chase after them, while no one noticed a figure behind the trees in the courtyard. As the group walked away, Xiaohu emerged from behind the tree and flew towards the roof, just in time to be seen by the servant.
0:29:48|0:30:8|After the followers chasing the young man who lived in the house left, he jumped out of the window. [Yin Luoxia] saw the masked intruder and quickly shouted, while the young man covered her mouth. [Yin Luoxia] calmed down.
0:30:40|0:30:56|Captain Tang rudely pushed Yanzi Li San, who was blocking the entrance with a cane, and went in to check. Jin Lan followed closely behind, while Captain Tang stood in the middle, carefully looking around but found no clues, then apologized. After failing to find the person, they turned and left.
0:30:56|0:31:8|After Captain Tang left, the attendant conscientiously closed the door. Luo Xia confirmed that the other party had already left, then turned and walked towards the costumes. She peeled off the heavy costume, searching for the young man's figure. The young man hiding on the beam above jumped down behind her.
0:31:30|0:31:41|The young man nodded in agreement and walked out. In the courtyard, under the watchful eyes of soldiers with guns in two rows, the master of the opera troupe carried props and walked towards the door. The young man blended in among them.
0:32:0|0:32:18|Captain Tang walked up to the young man who was tidying up the props with his head down. The young man slowly turned his head and met Captain Tang's eyes. Without waiting for any objection, the young man knocked Captain Tang to the ground in one move. Then, with the help of a bamboo pole, he sent himself out of the courtyard, and the followers' shots did not hit the young man.
0:32:18|0:32:29|The young man fled to the main street, hiding under the archway. The noise of the pursuers woke up a little beggar sleeping on the street. Seeing the pursuers getting closer, the young man had no choice but to climb up the archway to hide. Hurry!
0:33:3|0:33:22|Seeing that Yanzi Li San was skilled in martial arts, Jin Lan quickly approached to inquire. The two walked in the opposite direction of the pursuers, with Jin Lan leading the way and the young man following. They didn't notice a basin of water falling down.
0:33:33|0:33:47|The shopkeeper became excited when he saw Yanzi Li San, and laboriously moved his lame leg closer to him.
0:33:53|0:33:55|The young man helped the kneeling person up from the ground.
0:34:3|0:34:5|The young beggar suddenly knelt down in front of [Yanzi Li San].
0:34:47|0:34:52|[Yanzi Li San] pondered for a moment, then slowly spoke. [Yanzi Li San] used both hands and feet to climb over the wall.
0:35:14|0:35:28|[Yanzi Li San] gazed into the distance, lost in thought. [Jin Lan] paced back and forth with her hands on her waist, when suddenly, she spotted a sachet in front of her and yanked it down, throwing it on the ground. This sachet was placed there by [Yanzi Li San] in the tree. Not long after.
0:35:53|0:36:12|[Yanzi Li San] emotions drifted back to the present, looking silently into the distance. The next day, [Yanzi Li San] went to Beihai Park. [Yanzi Li San] looked towards the person responding.
0:36:30|0:36:34|With a slight smile, [Yanzi Li San] and [Jin Lan] arrived at the lakeside.
0:37:40|0:37:45|[Yanzi Li San] came to another brothel, where several girls walked into the private room and lined up.
0:39:51|0:39:57|Pusla grabbed Yanzi Li San's hand and walked towards the table, then picked up the box and handed it to her.
0:40:6|0:40:12|The landlady opened it, saw the jade bowl, and gave a slight snort before placing it back on the table persistently.
0:40:24|0:40:43|Lai Fu looked up and saw Luo Xia standing in the line of beggars. He handed the bowl in his hand to [Jin Lan]. The waiter quickly handed five steamed buns to Lai Fu.
0:40:47|0:40:50|[Jin Lan] hesitated to speak, as Ichiro Kawashima arrived at the Qin Wang Mansion to pay a visit.
0:41:45|0:41:56|Upon seeing Ichiro Kawashima's fondness for the jade seal, Yanzi Li San came up with an idea. At night, outside the General's Mansion, a group of soldiers patrolled the area. Suddenly, a figure flashed through the air and landed on the eaves of the courtyard.
0:41:56|0:42:6|In this scene, [Yanzi Li San], who was squatting on a tree, happened to see it. After putting on his mask, he quickly followed and when the other party stopped, [Yanzi Li San] picked up a stone and threw it at the person, who caught it.
0:42:6|0:42:21|After looking around, the masked man did not see the figure of [Yanzi Li San], so he threw away the stone and flew towards the treasure vault of the Grand Marshal's Mansion. Seeing that the other party did not understand, [Yanzi Li San] shook her head helplessly. As soon as the masked man landed, the door of the treasure vault suddenly opened, and dozens of guns pointed at him from inside.
0:42:21|0:42:40|He dodged the bullets and the soldiers inside the door tried to escape from the masked man, so they went out and lined up to aim and shoot. Seeing that the opponent's firepower was too strong, the masked man raised a stone slab to shoot at the soldiers. Seeing that the soldier with a gun was hit by the stone slab, the masked man prepared to leave, but was blocked by a soldier who knew kung fu. The masked man had no choice but to engage with him.
0:42:41|0:42:56|The two are evenly matched, entangled with each other. A group of soldiers with guns aimed, but dare not shoot at will. [Yanzi Li San] took advantage of everyone's attention being drawn by the masked man, sneaked into the treasure trove alone, and arrived next to the cabinet where the treasures were stolen last time, pulling open the mural room.
0:42:57|0:43:4|[Yanzi Li San] easily dodged the mechanism and approached the table to take a look. Upon seeing the imperial seal inside, she nodded in satisfaction.
0:43:4|0:43:15|Outside, Yanzi Li San and Jin Lan are still fighting with the soldiers. Seeing both sides getting tired, Yanzi Li San kicks a soldier down, and the other soldiers start shooting. Yanzi Li San quickly pulls up a soldier from the ground to shield himself from the bullets.
0:43:15|0:43:22|At this moment, [Yanzi Li San] soared out of the treasure trove, the soldiers shifted their firepower, the masked man took the opportunity to escape, and [Jin Lan] hurried over.
0:43:41|0:43:56|The two of them shuttle through the narrow alley. Suddenly, a masked person leaps in front of [Yanzi Li San], blocking the huge deer in front of the other person, and pounces towards [Yanzi Li San], attempting to snatch the jade seal in the other person's hand. [Yanzi Li San] quickly counterattacks, but the jade seal is kicked away by the masked person. As they both jump up, they each grab the jade seal with one hand.
0:44:3|0:44:18|Taking advantage of the masked man's attention being drawn to the soldiers below, [Yanzi Li San] kicked the hand that was trying to grab the bloody cloth and swiftly flew away. Seeing this, the masked man hurriedly chased after, both of them moving lightly like swallows weaving through the trees. [Yanzi Li San]'s feet lightly touched the ground and then immediately took flight.
0:44:18|0:44:36|The masked man's body is agile and nimble, performing twelve somersaults and twelve leaps. Following closely behind, he sees [Yanzi Li San] within his attack range. The masked man slaps his left shoulder with a palm, forcing [Yanzi Li San] to stop on the tree trunk to adjust his position. The masked man then uses a spinning side kick, kicking the jade seal into the air, and both of them leap up simultaneously.
0:45:21|0:45:26|Seeing [Yanzi Li San] so determined, Zhang Lu no longer hesitated when faced with the jade seal in front of him.
0:45:48|0:45:52|[Yanzi Li San] pondered for a moment after hearing this, then turned around and said.
0:46:22|0:46:25|Director glared shamefully at Captain Tang.
0:46:30|0:46:33|Yanzi Li San placed the jade seal in his arms.
0:47:5|0:47:7|Ichiro Kawashima looked at the jade seal in front of him, his eyes shining.
0:47:13|0:47:31|Upon hearing Pusi speak, Zhang Lu finally understood and glared at him angrily. Seeing the jade seal in Changtang Yilang's hand, Zhang Lu rushed forward to snatch it, but was stopped by a warrior. She kicked the warrior away and grabbed the jade seal.
0:47:38|0:47:52|After Changpu Temple finished speaking, Zhang Lu ran out with the jade seal. When he was close to the door, he was blocked by three Japanese warriors. The warriors took off their outer robes to reveal ninja costumes underneath. Before Zhang Lu could react, the warriors brandished their swords and stopped him from charging towards them.
0:47:52|0:48:6|Zhang Lu, in order to protect the jade seal from being taken away, could only resist with one hand, while the ninja coordinated and stalled. Unexpectedly, Zhang Lu remained at ease facing the outnumbered enemies. After a few rounds, the ninja was actually suppressed and unable to fight back. Seeing this situation, [Pusi] had to loudly command [Zhi].
0:48:17|0:48:19|Zhang Luchao [Pusi] kneels down.
0:48:53|0:49:4|Seeing [Yanzi Li San] getting angry, Jin Lan had no choice but to reluctantly hand over the jade seal to [Yanzi Li San]. Although Jin Lan's movements were slow, she no longer resisted. As the jade seal approached, [Yanzi Li San] coldly snatched it away.
0:49:9|0:49:22|Upon hearing the order from [Yanzi Li San], Zhang Lu had no choice but to comply. After bowing to [Yanzi Li San], she tearfully left the room. Ichiro Kawashima, who was standing by, remained silent as he watched everything unfold. The landlady was shocked as she once again confirmed the request made by [Yanzi Li San].
0:50:12|0:50:22|Cai Feng, who was eavesdropping next to the tent, suddenly frowned, and then Jin Lan replied.
0:50:31|0:50:48|Upon hearing what [Pus] said, Yanzi Li San immediately showed an excited expression. She quickly returned to the room, closed the door, leaned against it for a moment of contemplation, then walked towards the cabinet against the wall. After carefully searching through the drawer, she took out a handkerchief and examined it closely.
0:50:48|0:50:55|The exquisite handkerchief was embroidered with a vivid Yanzi, and Jin Lan, looking at the Yanzi on the handkerchief, couldn't help but fall into beautiful memories.
0:51:22|0:51:39|It turns out that [Cai Feng] is the first love that [Yanzi Li San] is looking for, [Jin Lan]. [Jin Lan] gently strokes the swallow on the handkerchief, walks slowly towards the table, sits down, puts the handkerchief on her chest, and a hint of sadness flashes in her eyes.
0:51:39|0:51:45|Zhang Lu was surrounded by soldiers at the gate of Prince Qing's Mansion. When Ma Yingjie arrived, he leaned against a stone pillar nervously without moving.
0:51:47|0:51:55|Upon hearing the command, the soldier reached out to subdue Yanzi Li San, but was knocked away by a slap from her. Ma Dongmei, seeing this, drew the pistol from her waist and aimed it at Yanzi Li San's forehead.
0:52:34|0:52:37|After Puci finished speaking, he noticed that Mayingjie was hesitating.
0:52:42|0:52:44|Ma Yingjie put away his gun after hearing it.
0:53:39|0:53:51|At the Fengyue Tower, a row of flamboyantly dressed courtesans stood in the room, each with a bright flower pinned in their coiled hair. [Jin Lan] suddenly approached, asking in surprise.
0:54:8|0:54:13|Seeing the girls being driven out by Huwa, Jin Lan immediately came in to serve.
0:55:24|0:55:40|Upon hearing Lai Fu's voice, Huwa turned around and saw that Lai Fu had already been surrounded by Captain Tang's men. Without hesitation, she jumped up, grabbed the fence with both hands, and kicked down the men who were rushing towards her. Seeing this, Captain Tang grabbed Huwa by the chest.
0:55:40|0:55:48|Huwa took off his hat, his embroidered hair immediately scattered. Captain Tang withdrew his palm and saw the other party stunned. Huwa kicked towards the opponent's crotch.
0:55:58|0:56:14|Tiger Cub ran to the corner of the street to hide, waiting for the followers to chase after him. Suddenly he attacked, kicking the opponent to the ground, and the other three people came to help. Tiger Cub could only use his agile body to create distance and gradually break through. However, her strength was too small, kicking the opponent's bone and injuring herself.
0:56:14|0:56:34|Seeing the opportunity for a breather, [Yanzi Li San] immediately adjusted her tactics. After using a shoulder throw to slam the nearest follower against the bamboo pole, she wrapped her belt around the follower's feet. Using the opponent's force, she kicked down another follower who was rushing towards her. The followers temporarily distanced themselves, jumping onto the triangular wheel filled with heavy objects.
0:56:34|0:56:42|Waiting for the opponent to approach, [Yanzi Li San] gathered his strength and leaped up, directly sending the two of them flying. Seeing the four people on the ground, he quickly got up and threw his belt towards the opponent.
0:57:6|0:57:25|After listening to Pus's words, [Zhang Lu] lowered her head in contemplation. In the grand mansion, soldiers stood in line at the entrance of the main house. His men tied [Lai Fu] to a pillar and forcefully pulled the rope, causing [Lai Fu] to cry out in pain. The strong men secured the rope and then took out nails, aiming at [Lai Fu]'s hand.
0:57:37|0:57:42|[Ma Yingjie] stood up and walked towards [Lai Fu]. Seeing that [Lai Fu] was ignoring him, [Ma Yingjie] gestured for his men to bring a long sword.
0:58:8|0:58:19|Yanzi Li San pushes Ma Yingjie away. Yanzi Li San pushes Ma Yingjie away. Yanzi Li San pushes Ma Yingjie away. Yanzi Li San pushes Ma Yingjie away.
0:58:41|0:58:48|Yanzi Li San did not harm himself just now, Jin Lan is Captain Tang's assistant, and then she stepped forward to inquire.
0:59:14|0:59:16|[Ma Yingjie] looked at [Yanzi Li San] in confusion.
1:0:16|1:0:27|Captain Tang could only reluctantly release the person, and when he returned home, [Luo Xia] gently helped Lai Fu bandage his wound. Lai Fu looked at [Luo Xia] affectionately, and when she noticed, he shyly lowered his head.
1:0:31|1:0:41|Pressing her face against [Luo Xia]'s cheek, [Luo Xia]'s movements became gentler. This scene was seen by [Yanzi Li San], who had come in to greet them, so he retreated before the two noticed him.
1:0:58|1:1:7|Huwa turned and left. [Luo Xia] went out to look for Huwa, while [Yanzi Li San] approached to inquire.
1:1:13|1:1:24|After speaking, [Yanzi Li San] turned and left. As he walked out, he bumped into [Jin Lan] waiting at the door. Upon hearing this, [Jin Lan] approached [Yanzi Li San] and spoke slowly.
1:1:53|1:1:59|Ichiro Kawashima reached out and took the box from the car, handing it to Jin Lan leaning against the door.
1:2:14|1:2:22|Just as the two were about to exchange items, a bomb blew up the goods on the truck. [Yanzi Li San] jumped out, snatched the jade seal, and kicked over the guard.
1:2:23|1:2:34|Later, in another explosion, [Yanzi Li San] prepared to fly up to the city wall with the imperial seal. Suddenly, ninjas hidden in the shadows to protect Ichiro Kawashima appeared, blocking [Yanzi Li San]'s path.
1:2:34|1:2:44|[Yanzi Li San] was forced to flip back to his original position. Before he could react, several ninjas immediately raised their swords and charged towards him. [Jin Lan] hid behind the car, peering through the car window at the confrontation between the ninjas and [Yanzi Li San].
1:2:44|1:3:2|Meanwhile, Ichiro Kawai on the side kept wiping the cold sweat on his forehead with a handkerchief. Seeing the impressive martial arts skills of Yanzi Li San, the ninja immediately threw the prepared fire spell to the ground, the ignited fuse covered by soil in an instant. Yanzi Li San quickly jumped up upon seeing this, kicking the burning goods towards the ninja. The remaining two ninjas tried to move forward to stop him.
1:3:2|1:3:6|[Yanzi Li San] was kicked to the ground by [Jin Lan] and saw the other party all lying on the ground unable to get up.
1:3:7|1:3:29|[Yanzi Li San] leaped onto the city wall and escaped from the scene. Seeing that [Yanzi Li San] had disappeared, Chuandao Ichiro, who was hiding behind the car, angrily rushed towards the ninja and slapped him hard. Upon hearing the soldier's report, [Ma Yingjie] looked towards the door.
1:4:19|1:4:21|[Yanzi Li San] under Captain Tang's gaze.
1:4:43|1:5:8|The guard frisks. Captain Tang leads [Yanzi Li San] towards the cell. Captain Tang keeps looking back at [Yanzi Li San]. The guard hurries forward to unlock the door. [Yanzi Li San] is pushed into the cell. After putting chains on [Yanzi Li San]'s hands and feet, the guard roughly pushes him onto the bed.
1:5:17|1:5:38|If not, Captain Tang finished speaking and turned to leave. Then, he clapped his hands and locked the prison door. After looking around, [Yanzi Li San] fixed his gaze on the translucent high window. The madam of Maple Moon Tower came to find [Jin Lan], and seeing her busy inside the room, she approached only to discover that she was packing her luggage.
1:5:41|1:5:49|Xiaoma walked into [Jin Lan]'s bed and slowly sat beside her. [Jin Lan] placed a piece of jewelry in Xiaoma's hand.
1:5:52|1:5:55|[Ma Dongmei] shook her head sadly.
1:6:45|1:6:50|Yanzi Li San saw Jin Lan crying and begging on her knees, and Xiao Ma slowly knelt down beside Jin Lan.
1:7:37|1:7:50|Late at night, the cunning [Yanzi Li San] suddenly opened his eyes, pondered for a moment, and walked towards the prison door. He looked outside through the window and saw no one patrolling. [Yanzi Li San] then used a bone-shrinking bow to free his hands and feet from the iron chains.
1:7:50|1:8:4|Yanzi Li San then leaped up and carefully observed near the window close to the roof, seeing the only guard leaning against the wall fast asleep. [Yanzi Li San] cautiously crawled out from the window frame, then easily climbed up the wall to the roof, escaping the prison through the skylight.
1:8:6|1:8:9|[Yanzi Li San], dressed in night clothes, jumped into the courtyard and ran to the door of the room where the light was being extinguished.
1:8:21|1:8:34|[Yanzi Li San] did not leave after deliberately causing a commotion, but stood in the courtyard waiting for everyone to arm themselves and surround him. The thugs launched the first attack, but [Yanzi Li San] quickly dodged and kicked one of them who had come forward, knocking him down.
1:8:34|1:8:46|The thugs kept launching attacks at [Yanzi Li San], but he effortlessly dodged almost all of them. After the fight, [Yanzi Li San] remained unscathed, as if the opponents' attacks had no effect at all.
1:8:46|1:8:58|He swiftly maneuvered among the crowd, seizing every opportunity to strike at the opponents' vital points, rendering them unable to fight back. One of the thugs was pushed down by [Yanzi Li San], knocking out a front tooth.
1:9:1|1:9:16|[Yanzi Li San]'s skills were too agile, making all the thugs feel powerless. In the end, [Yanzi Li San] successfully defeated everyone, only expending some physical energy. He glanced at the thugs lying on the ground, turned around and left, leaving behind a scene of chaos and pain.
1:9:16|1:9:27|After leaving, [Yanzi Li San] did not go straight back to the cell, but went to the bustling street to show off his light skills. He deliberately jumped in front of the rickshaw driver, scaring him so much that he almost dropped the passenger.
1:9:35|1:9:54|The streets were crowded with people looking for the flying thief. On the prison side, Captain Tang kicked open the iron door, grabbed the guard by the collar. Captain Tang walked towards the cell where Yanzi Li San was detained, and saw Yanzi Li San lying on the bed.
1:9:58|1:10:1|After the guard finished speaking, Captain Tang looked troubled, and Jin Lan went to the mansion to find Young Master.
1:10:25|1:10:50|After getting up from the desk, Yanzi Li San listened and pondered for a moment before slowly speaking. Jin Lan, upon hearing this, turned and left. The disappointment in the Young Marshal's eyes was hard to conceal, as he could only watch her leave.
1:10:59|1:11:19|[Jin Lan] was locked up by the stepmother, and her friend came to bring her food. Seeing no response, the girl walked towards the inner room. Suddenly, she stopped and saw the haggard [Jin Lan] sitting behind the door. Seeing the other person in such a state, the girl helplessly shook her head and then squatted down close to [Jin Lan].
1:11:23|1:11:26|[Jin Lan] looked up and the girl spoke to persuade.
1:11:31|1:11:50|The soldier sealed the big bowl of Yanzi Li San. Qiuyue saw a large crowd gathering at the entrance of the big bowl, and just as she was about to approach, she spotted Huwa among the crowd.
1:12:55|1:13:1|Tiger Baby was ruthlessly pushed out of the prison by Captain Tang's men, and then Captain Tang shouted at the guards.
1:13:14|1:13:21|Captain Tang walked towards the guard who had taken the bribe from Yanzi Li San before Tiger Baby left.
1:13:36|1:13:41|The drunken guard was slapped awake by Captain Tang, and seeing the other sober up, Captain Tang slowly spoke.
1:13:58|1:14:13|The next day, the chieftain sent a wedding sedan to marry [Jin Lan]. On the way back to the mansion, many passersby stopped and gathered around to watch. Inside the sedan, the bride, dressed in a bright wedding gown, sat upright on the stool, her face covered by a veil.
1:14:13|1:14:20|The onlookers eagerly watched the sedan chair, and as Tiger Baby walked out of the alley, he deliberately got close to the other party and casually stole the money pouch.
1:14:25|1:14:28|When leaving, Yanzi Li San deliberately shook the money pouch in front of the man.
1:14:36|1:14:48|Wuwa intentionally led everyone to the front of the welcoming procession, forcing the procession to stop. Inside the sedan chair, [Jin Lan] heard the noisy shouts outside and couldn't help but lift the curtain to see what was happening.
1:14:48|1:14:58|Facing overwhelming odds, [Yanzi Li San] stood in front of the plump matchmaker, blocking her, while the men who were trying to surround him were pushed apart and accidentally bumped into the matchmaker's chest.
1:14:58|1:15:22|[Yanzi Li San] took the opportunity to push the matchmaker towards the others. Seeing several people being overwhelmed by the matchmaker, [Yanzi Li San] quickly pulled open the sedan curtain and called out for [Jin Lan]. Before Hua Wa could finish speaking, he was dragged out and forced to continue struggling with the others. One person took the opportunity to lock Hua Wa's arms from behind, and Hua Wa was kicked in the buttocks.
1:15:22|1:15:32|Several people forcibly dragged Yanzi Li San out, accidentally pulling down her pants. Yanzi Li San, realizing the danger, threw the stolen money into the air and quietly slipped away while the others were busy grabbing the money.
1:15:42|1:15:52|In the prison, [Yanzi Li San] tossed and turned, suddenly stood up and looked at the guard, then gazed at the ceiling. In the bridal chamber, [Jin Lan] anxiously waited for the arrival of [Yanzi Li San], but there was no sign of him.
1:15:52|1:16:8|He walked towards the door, pondered for a moment, and then opened it to check. A lightning accompanied by thunder startled Jin Lan. He turned around to see Yanzi Li San standing on his right side. Jin Lan pressed against the door and kept backing away, while Yanzi Li San steadily advanced into the room step by step, and then closed the door.
1:16:9|1:16:28|[Yanzi Li San] climbed up to the window high in the prison, seeing that several guards were not paying attention to him. He used a bone-shrinking bow to drill through the railing, covered one of the guards' heads with his clothes, and jumped down from the height when the other guards had not reacted yet. He launched an attack on the guards, who were no match for [Yanzi Li San] and were quickly knocked down to the ground.
1:16:51|1:17:14|Tonight, Yanzi Li San was pushed against the table corner by Puzi. Facing the prison guards rushing to help from outside the door, Yanzi Li San used all her skills. Seeing all the guards blocking her being knocked down, the guard holding the keys quickly begged for mercy. Puzi, who was kicked in the face, instantly looked ferocious.
1:17:17|1:17:32|Turning around and picking up the accessories hanging on the cane, pulling out the scabbard, [Yanzi Li San] angrily walks towards the fallen [Jin Lan]. Seeing this, [Jin Lan] retreats repeatedly. After a flash of lightning, Zhang Lu, who is guarding the door, sees a figure flash by. She quickly jumps up and grabs the other person.
1:17:45|1:17:54|Yanzi Li San took the opportunity to rush towards the door, but Zhang Lu blocked Yanzi Li San's path. The two did not give way to each other. Inside the room, they pushed Jin Lan onto the bed and urged her fiercely.
1:18:3|1:18:7|Upon hearing Jin Lan's response, Yanzi Li San wanted to step forward, but was blocked by Zhang Lu.
1:18:42|1:18:50|[Yanzi Li San] pushed open the door, only to see [Jin Lan] being stabbed by Piao Si. [Yanzi Li San] stepped forward, kicked Piao Si away, and thrust the sword into Piao Si's chest.
1:18:54|1:19:5|Covered in blood, [Jin Lan] leaned on [Yanzi Li San] and tightly held his hand. Zhang Lu caught up and saw the dying Bodhisattva. [Yanzi Li San] carried [Jin Lan] away.
1:19:32|1:19:47|After Zhang Lu saw Park Si-yan's rejection, she thought for a moment, then looked fiercely in the direction where [Yanzi Li San] and Jin Lan were leaving. As the night grew darker, under the bell tower of the city, Lai Fu, Luo Xia, and Hu Wa stood silently behind [Yanzi Li San] and Jin Lan, unexpectedly being held in the arms of [Yanzi Li San] who was sitting on the ground.
1:19:49|1:19:59|Yanzi Li San called out faintly to Jin Lan, placing their token of love into Jin Lan's hand. Jin Lan struggled to bring the sachet to her nose.
1:20:21|1:20:38|[Jin Lan] The flower shadow had just fallen when the sachet rolled out of her palm. [Yanzi Li San] looked at his lifeless lover, gently lifted [Jin Lan]'s cheek, and slowly pressed his lips against it. [Yanzi Li San] slowly placed [Jin Lan]'s hands on his chest, then lowered his head and cried softly.
1:20:38|1:20:48|The three people behind saw Jin Lan had left, and they all knelt behind Yanzi Li San. At the foot of the city tower, Zhang Lu walked forward with an angry face, when suddenly the sound of galloping horses came from behind.
1:20:49|1:21:4|He turned to look and saw a large group of soldiers carrying oil lamps, riding fast on their steeds. In order to avoid the horses, Zhang Lu quickly stepped back to observe the other side. Behind the cavalry, there were many soldiers running forward, all heading towards the building where [Yanzi Li San] was located.
1:21:6|1:21:19|Zhang Lu sensed something was wrong and followed the soldiers to the Sword Tower. Hearing the shouts of soldiers downstairs, Huwa hurried to the edge of the city wall to look out, only to see the soldiers quickly filling the area below. Huwa returned to [Yanzi Li San]'s side, anxiously saying.
1:21:46|1:22:3|Lai Fu took the two away with a gun, [Yanzi Li San] saw them leaving, looked at the gold pellets on the ground, and his eyes instantly turned fierce. Downstairs, two rows of soldiers lined up, a sedan parked in the middle, Captain Tang and Ma Yingjie got off the vehicle from the side, both looking up at the top of the building.
1:22:12|1:22:19|In Jianlou, [Yanzi Li San] tried to delay time for Lai Fusan by vigorously swinging the clock pendulum to attract everyone's attention.
1:22:33|1:22:37|With the permission of Ma Yingjie, Zhang Lu displayed his light skills and quickly climbed up the city tower.
1:22:43|1:23:0|Zhang Lu went up to the city tower and quickly found the location of [Yanzi Li San]. Seeing [Yanzi Li San] half kneeling beside [Jin Lan]'s body, Zhang Lu slowly approached. When [Yanzi Li San] saw someone coming up the tower, she slowly turned her head to look. Seeing that the newcomer was Zhang Lu, she stood up and glared fiercely at the other person.
1:23:11|1:23:28|[Yanzi Li San] clenched his fists and walked towards [Jin Lan]. After speaking, [Yanzi Li San] leaped forward with all his strength, attempting a flying kick towards [Jin Lan], but was easily dodged by the opponent, resulting in a missed strike. After a few moves, the fight between the two sides did not cause any substantial harm to each other.
1:23:28|1:23:41|[Ma Yingjie] and [Captain Tang] each lead a team of soldiers running up from both sides of the city wall. After meeting up, [Ma Yingjie] commands his men to split up and search for [Yanzi Li San]. On the other side, [Yanzi Li San] and [Zhang Lu] are engaged in a back-and-forth battle, gradually getting into their groove.
1:23:41|1:23:55|[Yanzi Li San] seized the opportunity of [Zhang Lu]'s unguarded upper body, kicking him into the big clock. He followed up with a solid kick to [Zhang Lu]'s chest. [Zhang Lu] retaliated with a punch to [Yanzi Li San]'s face. Hearing the sound of the fight, [Ma Yingjie] and others stopped in their tracks.
1:23:57|1:24:15|Seeing [Ma Yingjie] suddenly stop, [Captain Tang] waved to the soldiers behind him, then the two of them led the soldiers towards the direction of the sound. When they reached the middle of the building, they couldn't distinguish the sound of the fight for a moment. The two split up again, with [Yanzi Li San] being kicked down below the bell cone. Seeing that [Zhang Lu] was reluctant, he quickly got up and kicked the bell cone towards the opponent.
1:24:15|1:24:39|Zhang Lu couldn't avoid it and was knocked down by the heavy wood. [Yanzi Li San] pursued relentlessly. Seeing the wood flying towards him again, Zhang Lu quickly rolled over to dodge the attack. He then stood up unsteadily and assumed a defensive posture. [Yanzi Li San] gathered strength to deliver a final blow, but suddenly a bullet hit his right shoulder.
1:24:39|1:24:45|Zhang Lu realized what was happening, turned around and was shot dead by the squad led by [Ma Yingjie].
1:24:52|1:25:20|Ma Yingjie began to observe the surroundings when he didn't see Yanzi Li San. He looked up at the roof, but there was no one there. Suddenly, he was attracted by the bloodstains climbing up the bell. The soldiers leaned against the pillars to form a human wall and climbed up on all sides. After carefully searching the soldier who climbed up the beam, they did not find Yanzi Li San.
1:25:29|1:25:47|[Yanzi Li San] reached out and gently picked up the swallow perched on the branch, the little swallow pecked at his fingers. [Yanzi Li San] released the swallow, but as soon as the little swallow flew out, it was shot down by a bullet and fell to the ground.
1:25:51|1:26:8|[Yanzi Li San] found that Captain Tang's followers had caught up. He jumped directly from the tree, but the intense firepower from the other side made it impossible to get close. He could only roll back and create distance. [Yanzi Li San] tackled a lone follower, took the opponent's pistol and fought back. [Yanzi Li San] pulled the follower up to shield himself from the gunfire.
1:26:10|1:26:24|Captain Tang emerged from the woods, but there was no sign of [Yanzi Li San]. He carefully pushed aside the branches blocking his view, and [Yanzi Li San] suddenly jumped in front of him. However, Captain Tang, who was already on guard, easily dodged the attack. Their bodies intertwined as their fists collided.
1:26:26|1:26:40|Captain Tang launched another attack, sweeping repeatedly and not giving Yanzi Li San a chance to get up. Yanzi Li San waited for the right moment and then threw a heavy punch towards Captain Tang's face. After taking a punch, Captain Tang retaliated fiercely by hitting Yanzi Li San's back with a palm strike.
1:26:40|1:26:48|[Yanzi Li San] saw the distance being pulled apart, aimed at Captain Tang's chest, and unleashed a series of flying kicks. [Yanzi Li San] was entangled by the crowd.
1:26:51|1:27:4|On the other side, Ma Yingjie led a large group of soldiers rushing to support Captain Tang. Captain Tang slammed [Yanzi Li San] to the ground, and [Yanzi Li San] used his elbow to suppress Captain Tang, launching a series of attacks on Captain Tang's chest. Seizing the opportunity, Captain Tang grabbed [Yanzi Li San]'s injured right shoulder.
1:27:7|1:27:27|[Yanzi Li San] suddenly drove his knee into Captain Tang's waist, Captain Tang didn't have time to dodge, making a dull sound. Ma Yingjie arrived just in time, commanding his subordinates, a soldier leaped forward and kicked down the unprepared [Yanzi Li San]. Seeing this, the follower stepped on the right shoulder of [Yanzi Li San] who was being held by two people, looking ahead.
1:27:27|1:27:37|Finding their vision becoming blurry, the two of them knocked down [Yanzi Li San]. A soldier randomly drew a knife from his waist, and the fallen [Yanzi Li San] picked up the fallen swallow.
1:27:39|1:27:56|A soldier ruthlessly thrusts a knife into [Yanzi Li San]'s back, causing [Yanzi Li San] to instantly faint. On the street, two rows of soldiers suddenly run over. After stopping, they use guns to block the crowded civilians from approaching, while another group of infantry soldiers rudely shove pedestrians standing on the road.
1:28:1|1:28:7|Several soldiers rode past on horse-drawn carriages, forcing the civilians to step back. A pedestrian shouted angrily at the soldiers.
1:28:30|1:28:47|Yanzi Li San, wearing a shirt soaked in blood, stood dizzily in the middle of the cart, with his hands tied behind his back, and a princess with a brand on her back inserted behind him.
1:28:55|1:28:57|[Yanzi Li San] awoke quietly amidst the crowd's shouts.
1:29:6|1:29:15|The gloomy uncle took advantage of the golf cart approaching to try to feed the remaining wine in the bowl to [Yanzi Li San].
1:29:24|1:29:26|Yanzi Li San looked up and felt the wine sprinkled in the air.
1:29:37|1:29:49|As the ball car kept moving towards the execution platform, the emotions of the people changed from excitement to sorrow. They spontaneously knelt down in the direction Yanzi Li San was leaving, their eyes filled with deep sorrow.
1:29:49|1:29:56|[金兰] who was following behind, seeing this scene, was at a loss for a moment. The Tiger Baby who broke through the soldiers' blockade knelt by the roadside, crying uncontrollably.
1:29:59|1:30:9|Hundreds of swallows flew in from a distance, circling around [Yanzi] and [Li San], as if the common people by the river were bidding farewell together to this hero who had fought against evil for the people.
