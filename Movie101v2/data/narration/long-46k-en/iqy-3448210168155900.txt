0:2:31|0:2:57|Opening the battle log of 1952, it is written that on October 14th, in order to disrupt peace and escalate the war, the American aggressors, after rejecting peace talks at Panmunjom, launched a large-scale attack on two hill positions in the Shangganling area at six fifteen in the morning today.
0:3:1|0:3:34|On October 18th, in the face of a large-scale attack by the enemy who was well prepared, our army was in a passive and unfavorable position. The battle was extremely intense and brutal, with continuous artillery fire and smoke filling the air on the fifth day. A soldier held his breath, crouched in the trench, then rushed out and handed the headset to [Meng Degui] inside the 7th Company's tent.
0:4:0|0:4:22|A soldier runs in. [Meng Degui] takes off his headphones and runs out of the tent. On the small path halfway up the mountain behind, the Eighth Company led by [Zhang Zhongfa] is rushing non-stop, trying to support the Seventh Company as soon as possible. The enemy plane drops a bomb, which falls into the lake beside the mountain road, causing a huge splash of water.
0:4:23|0:4:42|Soldiers wearing convenient and concealable straw hats on their heads, running forward. Some soldiers are riding trucks to the front line. A female soldier stands at the intersection, waving a flag to direct traffic. Two trucks turn into the mountain road on the right, while the rest of the trucks continue to move forward.
0:4:42|0:5:2|Several farmers are filling in the holes on the road, while a sanitation worker is carrying a stretcher to transport the wounded. Korean women are setting up a large pot to boil water for the soldiers. As the last truck passes by the women, the soldiers on the truck keep throwing down supplies ignited by the gunfire.
0:5:2|0:5:14|On the top of Qilian Peak, our soldiers are holding their ground, resisting the enemy's fierce attacks. Some soldiers are firing machine guns at the enemy, while others are continuously throwing grenades at them. [Commander] rushes over.
0:5:19|0:5:23|[Commander Meng Degui] knelt on the ground and helped up the soldier hit by a shell.
0:5:30|0:5:43|The soldier tilted his head and sacrificed himself. Instructor [Meng Degui] slowly put him down, took off his hat, pondered for a moment, stood up, and shouted to his comrades.
0:5:54|0:6:1|A shell landed beside [Meng Degui], and the fragments hit his eyes. He covered his eyes in pain and staggered into the command post.
0:6:19|0:6:32|After the chief of staff issued the communication order to the soldier, he picked up the phone. The chief of staff then looked down at his watch.
0:6:42|0:6:45|[Commander] pondered with his hands behind his back for a moment, then walked to the side, paused, and turned back.
0:7:10|0:7:13|He walked through the aisle, entered another room, and asked the political commissar sitting at the table. The political commissar glanced at his watch, exchanged a smile with the mayor, and walked over to shake hands with [Zhang Zhongfa].
0:7:44|0:7:57|[Zhang Zhongfa] took off his hat and pulled out a towel from his pants pocket to wipe his sweat. After putting on his hat, [Zhang Zhongfa] took the Tang porcelain cup and drank water in big gulps. The [commander] walked up and spoke.
0:8:6|0:8:12|[The commander] led [Zhang Zhongfa] to the terrain sand table and pointed to a hill with a pen.
0:8:35|0:8:40|[Zhang Zhongfa] stared at the terrain sand table in thought, while [Chen Dehou] walked away with his hands behind his back.
0:9:39|0:9:44|[The commander] said. After [the commander] hung up the phone, Chuishi Yuan Lao Wang walked in. Lao Wang was about to leave when he saw [Zhang Zhongfa], he smiled, waved his hand, and walked out of the room.
0:10:43|0:10:47|The political commissar stood up and walked to [Zhang Zhongfa]'s side.
0:11:43|0:11:46|The mayor emphasized on the side, the political commissar hung up the phone, and Chuishi Yuan Lao Wang walked in again, mayor.
0:12:9|0:12:23|Old Wang left, [Commander] put on his hat and walked out of the house. He saw a soldier sitting on a stone outside, with a notebook on his lap, writing something. The soldier immediately stood up. [Commander] walked over. [Yang Decai] handed the diary to [Commander].
0:12:52|0:13:1|[The Mayor] returned the notebook to [Yang Decai], looked at him, then circled behind him, shook his water bottle, and walked back to face [Yang Decai].
0:13:25|0:13:27|[Yang Decai] took out a handkerchief and wiped the sweat off.
0:13:32|0:13:37|The platoon leader, who used to be a machine gunner, walked over. [Zhang Zhongfa] approached, and the [division commander] glanced at his watch.
0:13:55|0:14:5|[Zhang Zhongfa] saluted the [commander], who returned the salute. In the darkness of the night, flames shot up into the sky as the soldiers hurried along the road, with the infantrymen answering the phone calls.
0:14:20|0:14:43|The soldiers of the Eighth Company are carrying guns and running towards the main peak. Some soldiers are even supporting women. Before the sky is fully lit, they have already arrived near the main peak. Zhang Zhongfa, platoon leader Chen Dehou, and Yang Decai are lying in the trench to scout the situation. The hillside is bare, Chen Dehou said.
0:14:47|0:15:9|[Zhang Zhongfa] saw the signal from the Seventh Platoon and three of them quickly jumped out of the trench. [Meng Degui], with bandaged eyes, was crouching in the trench preparing grenades. [Zhang Zhongfa], [Chen Dehou], and [Yang Decai] climbed up the hill, where a soldier from the Seventh Platoon ran down to greet them and shook hands with them.
0:15:13|0:15:18|[Meng Degui] groped his way over and shook hands with [Zhang Zhongfa]. He covered his eyes.
0:15:39|0:15:41|[Meng Degui] gestures with his hands.
0:16:6|0:16:12|[Zhang Zhongfa] shakes hands with [Meng Degui], and the enemy starts attacking again. An enemy plane drops a bomb.
0:16:33|0:16:37|[Meng Degui] put down his hands and lowered his head. The soldier drove [Meng Degui] off the battlefield.
0:17:15|0:17:20|The enemy's artillery fire was very intense, and [Zhang Zhongfa] and his group quickly took cover in a cave.
0:17:23|0:17:44|In the sky, enemy planes continuously drop bombs, shattering a rock which rolls down the mountain. Inside the cave, soldiers feel the strong vibration of the entire mountain. On the hillside, the enemy deploys a large number of tanks, providing heavy artillery cover to the ground. For a moment, the entire position is filled with flying shells and smoke.
0:17:48|0:18:10|Under the dual cover of airplanes and tanks, the enemy forces kept advancing towards the mountaintop. The soldiers of the Eighth Company found it difficult to launch effective counterattacks, and could only constantly move between cover and trenches to minimize unnecessary casualties. Rocks and dirt kept hitting them.
0:18:18|0:18:35|[Chen Dehou] took cover behind a mound with a machine gun. After a while, the enemy artillery fire weakened. [Zhang Zhongfa] looked outside the cave and made a quick decision to lead the soldiers out of the cave. The soldiers of the Eighth Company sounded the horn for a counterattack.
0:18:38|0:18:54|[Chen Dehou] shook off the dirt on his body, set up the machine gun, and two soldiers lifted the cloth covering the machine gun, preparing to fire. [Zhang Zhongfa] concealed behind a large rock, looking down the mountain with a telescope, only to see a dense crowd of enemy soldiers on the hillside. [Zhang Zhongfa] said to the machine gunner.
0:19:1|0:19:21|On the mountaintop, a row of volunteer army cannons fired shells one after another, catching the enemy off guard. They fell down to avoid the shells, some tried to climb up again, but the volunteer army held the high ground with intense and concentrated artillery fire. They had no choice but to retreat down the mountain, some even lost their guns in the chaos.
0:19:21|0:19:33|The volunteer army continues to launch shells. The enemies in Area Four are knocked down one after another, with one enemy soldier covering his ears and running down the mountain in panic.
0:19:41|0:19:45|[Zhang Zhongfa] smiled, rolled up his sleeves, and loosened his collar.
0:19:45|0:20:6|[Yang Decai] handed him a water bottle. He took a big sip and suddenly realized something was wrong. He looked down the mountain and saw the enemy general ordering the soldiers to shoot at the retreating enemy soldiers in the valley, forcing them to charge forward despite the bombardment of the volunteer army shells. Several enemies fell to the ground with serious injuries.
0:20:11|0:20:37|Enemy soldiers rushed towards the mountaintop. [Zhang Zhongfa] frowned, his face full of anxiety. Enemy planes dropped bombs, narrowly missing the infantryman, who lay on the ground. The infantryman got up and continued to call out. [Zhang Zhongfa] shook off the dirt on his body and looked down the mountain. The hillside was densely packed with enemy troops.
0:20:45|0:21:4|[Yang Decai] ran to inform that the soldiers were vigorously throwing grenades behind the trenches, while one soldier kept firing a heavy machine gun at the enemy. Some enemies were hit and fell to the ground, while others continued to charge forward.
0:21:9|0:21:21|Some of the enemies have climbed to the mountaintop, hiding at the cliff edge and throwing grenades at our troops. [Zhang Zhongfa] and his soldiers are hiding behind the rocks on the mountaintop. With a wave of his hand, two soldiers rush out, but are quickly killed by the enemy's explosion.
0:21:21|0:21:38|[Zhang Zhongfa] sent out two soldiers with explosive barrels, charging out. At the same time, some enemy soldiers climbed up with machine guns. One of our soldiers was shot and rolled down from the mountaintop. Eighth Company held their ground firmly, and the enemy ultimately failed to reach the mountaintop.
0:21:42|0:22:7|After a round of battle, the smoke gradually dispersed, leaving bodies and weapons scattered on the hilltop, with the land blackened by artillery fire. Eighth Company began to clear the battlefield and rescue the wounded. [Zhang Zhongfa] surveyed the battlefield and issued orders. Soldiers operating heavy machine guns during the battle were quickly eating to replenish their strength.
0:22:12|0:22:38|After the war, the hilltop was in a mess, with various items shattered by shells scattered on the ground. [Zhang Zhongfa] instructed the soldiers to pay attention to collecting ammunition. Some soldiers carried wounded soldiers on their backs, some carried supplies, some collected scattered ammunition, and some continued to scout the enemy situation.
0:22:38|0:22:48|[Chen Dehou] sat in the trench smoking, while Mao Sihai sat beside him drinking water and nibbling on dry rations.
0:23:9|0:23:30|The world-renowned [Chen Dehou] and [Mao Sihai] had a sudden change in expression as the enemy launched a new round of attacks. The Eighth Company immediately joined the battle. A soldier of our army climbed to the top of the hill, occupied the advantageous position, and kept throwing grenades down the mountain to prevent the enemy from climbing up.
0:23:30|0:23:38|More soldiers arrived on the hillside and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Our soldiers were seen kicking, pushing, and using the butt of their rifles to strike the enemy.
0:23:40|0:23:46|A soldier was wrestling with the enemy on the ground, while another enemy standing by tried to hit him with the butt of the gun, but ended up hitting his own comrade on the back of the head.
0:23:49|0:24:2|A soldier, Zhang Zhongfa, was dragged up from the ground by two enemies holding his arms. He kicked one enemy away, then used a hand grenade to heavily strike the heads of the enemies on both sides. An enemy with a machine gun started shooting at him, and he eventually fell down.
0:24:2|0:24:16|A soldier leaped out of the trench with a bayonet, breaking into a group of enemies and engaging in a fight with them. On the hilltop, the enemy grabbed the explosive barrel of a soldier from our army, and the two were deadlocked. The soldier let go of the barrel while pulling out the fuse, causing the enemy to roll down the hill with the explosive barrel.
0:24:16|0:24:18|[Zhang Zhongfa] takes off his hat, while [Yang Decai] blows the horn.
0:24:44|0:25:7|The soldiers carried heavy machine guns, and [Zhang Zhongfa] personally went to the forefront of the battlefield. [Yang Decai] ran towards the light machine gun.
0:25:19|0:25:46|[Zhang Zhongfa] put on his hat, pushed aside the soldiers, and personally operated the heavy machine gun. He squinted one eye, with sweat beads all over his forehead. The battle log of 1952 recorded that on October 19th, at the position of the Eighth Company, in less than a morning, they repelled the enemy's increasingly frantic attacks twenty-three times.
0:25:46|0:26:1|A car stopped at the entrance of the camp. [Zhang Zhongfa] hurriedly got out and walked into the camp. A soldier carrying a gun and a bag followed him. Inside the room, [Zhang Zhongfa] took off his hat and handed it to him.
0:26:8|0:26:13|The chief of staff nodded, went to the command room, [Commander] took off his coat, while the political commissar looked at the terrain sand table, frowning.
0:26:38|0:26:49|The chief of staff walked in and reported to [General], saying that the orders had been issued and the troops on the position were retreating. Only the main peak position could not be contacted. How come?
0:27:33|0:27:54|At this moment, Zhang Zhongfa is operating a heavy machine gun, firing fiercely. The enemies are falling to the ground one after another, then retreating continuously. Yang Decai rushes over to report the orders. Zhang Zhongfa approaches him abruptly. Zhang Zhongfa looks down the mountain.
0:28:44|0:29:0|He shook his hand, frowned, and walked into the tunnel. He was also hit by the branches at the entrance. The lighting in the tunnel was not sufficient, with enough height for people to walk upright, but only enough width for two or three people to stand side by side.
0:29:0|0:29:9|The soldiers crowded in the narrow tunnel, sitting on both sides against the rock wall, leaving a small space in the middle for only one person to pass through.
0:29:13|0:29:30|They smoked and drank water, each with a look of anger. Two soldiers almost started a fight. [Zhang Zhongfa] patrolled inside the tunnel, with [Yang Decai] shining a flashlight behind him. [Zhang Zhongfa] accidentally kicked a soldier, who immediately tightened his grip on the gun, ready to retaliate.
0:29:30|0:29:40|He looked up and saw it was the platoon leader, then he relaxed. Sergeant [Meng Degui] of the Seventh Company felt his way into the tunnel. [Zhang Zhongfa] ran over to support him.
0:29:45|0:29:57|Commander [Meng Degui] held hands with [Zhang Zhongfa], who helped [Meng Degui] to his bed. The soldiers watched them as he shook off [Zhang Zhongfa]'s hand and walked away angrily, then came back pointing at [Zhang Zhongfa], who was about to speak.
0:30:29|0:30:39|[Zhang Zhongfa] hesitated to speak, [Yang Decai] with tears in his eyes. A soldier wanted to step forward to speak, but was stopped by the soldier beside him.
0:30:43|0:30:50|Two soldiers supported Commander [Meng Degui] as he walked away, shouting towards the direction of [Zhang Zhongfa] before leaving.
0:30:56|0:31:1|[Zhang Zhongfa] lifted his lips, but explained nothing.
0:31:20|0:31:35|The soldiers left dejectedly. [Zhang Zhongfa] took off the binoculars hanging around his neck, sat on the edge of the bed, and then lay down again.
0:32:3|0:32:26|[Yang Decai] lit a candle, and the dim tunnel was immediately illuminated. [Zhang Zhongfa] glanced over and then turned away. [Yang Decai] looked at [Zhang Zhongfa], silently took down the water bottle, poured water into [Zhang Zhongfa]'s porcelain cup, and handed the cup and dry rations over.
0:32:26|0:32:36|[Zhang Zhongfa] refused, lowered his head, so [Yang Decai] had to put the things on the stool by the bed. [Chen Dehou] walked over with a gun on his back.
0:32:42|0:32:44|[Zhang Zhongfa] held his hand.
0:33:30|0:33:38|[Chen Dehou] scratched his head, [Zhang Zhongfa] furrowed his brow, raised the cup to drink water, and then abruptly put it down.
0:34:0|0:34:7|A female soldier runs into the tunnel. She looks around. She walks up to [Zhang Zhongfa].
0:34:59|0:35:3|[Zhang Zhongfa] took the headphones off the treadmill operator's head and put them on himself.
0:36:48|0:36:53|[Zhang Zhongfa] looked at Wang Lan, who saluted and happily ran out, then ran back.
0:37:16|0:37:18|Wang Lan ran away with a smile, [Zhang Zhongfa] turned his head and saw the soldiers all bowing their heads.
0:37:46|0:37:53|[Zhang Zhongfa] is moving, and the soldiers stand up. After dark, the enemy's searchlights shine back and forth in the mountain valley.
0:38:17|0:38:35|Several enemies were patrolling on the hilltop. [Zhang Zhongfa] and [Yang Decai] were lying at the entrance of the tunnel observing outside, with the searchlight occasionally illuminating their faces. [Yang Decai] had his gun ready for assault, but [Zhang Zhongfa] held him back.
0:38:47|0:39:9|[Yang Decai] bent down and rushed out, enemy fire erupted. [Zhang Zhongfa] anxiously leaned forward to look, only to see [Yang Decai] quickly lie down and avoid being hit. After a moment of silence, he agilely got up, jumped off the hill, ran out of the enemy searchlight's beam, and headed towards the camp.
0:39:11|0:39:33|[Zhang Zhongfa] watched as [Yang Decai] went away, then he left the tunnel entrance with relief. Inside the tunnel, the soldiers who had fought all day were exhausted and fell asleep in the narrow space. Wang Lan took good care of [Meng Degui], just as he had placed his hand on the instructor's pulse, the days of fatigue made him nod off with his head tilted.
0:39:33|0:39:35|[Zhang Zhongfa] quietly patrolled in the tunnel.
0:39:56|0:39:58|He walked to the bedside of [Meng Degui] and straightened his back. Wang Lan noticed that [Zhang Zhongfa] was approaching and quickly got up.
0:40:33|0:40:52|Zhang Zhongfa lightly kicked the sleeping Mao Sihai with his foot, Mao Sihai stood up and shouldered his gun, Zhang Zhongfa nodded towards Wang Lan, Mao Sihai straightened up and spoke, leading you.
0:40:57|0:41:0|Wang Lan is packing up, [Mao Sihai] walks over.
0:41:9|0:41:17|Meng Degui sat up, with Zhang Zhongfa supporting him. Meng Degui held Zhang Zhongfa's hand. A young soldier ran into the tunnel.
0:41:33|0:41:37|[Zhang Zhongfa] smiled, the day broke, the sunlight spilled into the valley, and the pine tree branches swayed gently in the wind.
0:42:2|0:42:25|In the misty mountains, inside the tunnel, soldiers are having breakfast. Three soldiers are looking out at the tunnel entrance, when suddenly they hear a noise above their heads. All the soldiers jump up and chase after the squirrel.
0:42:30|0:42:57|[Zhang Zhongfa] heard the commotion and went to check it out. He took off his hat and also ran to catch the squirrel. The soldiers chased after him, panting and sweating. [Zhang Zhongfa] quickly used his hat to grab the squirrel and caught it.
0:43:1|0:43:22|The soldiers surrounded [Zhang Zhongfa], eager to see the squirrel. They quickly put on their hats and straightened their collars as [Chen Dehou] walked over. [Zhang Zhongfa] handed the squirrel to a nearby soldier and strode towards the entrance of the tunnel.
0:43:23|0:43:50|In the distance, the sound of cannons can be heard as a large number of enemy troops are advancing towards Wusheng Mountain. On the hillside, the enemy soldiers are charging with guns in hand towards the trench.
0:43:59|0:44:19|The soldiers sprang into action. They carried the machine guns to the entrance of the tunnel, waiting for [Commander] to give orders. The hillside was bare with no cover, catching the enemy soldiers off guard. Many of them were hit by bullets and rolled down the mountain.
0:44:25|0:44:54|The heavy machine gunner kept firing, causing the enemies on the hillside to fall to the ground one after another. Following the infantryman's notification, heavy machine guns were set up at all the entrances of the bunkers. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. Those who were not hit either lay down on the spot or fled in confusion, with only a few still advancing towards Wusheng Mountain.
0:44:55|0:45:10|Several enemy soldiers discovered the location where [Ba Lian] was hiding. They hid behind cover, lying on the ground, and set up a machine gun, shooting towards the entrance of the trench. The soldiers at the trench entrance couldn't immediately locate the enemy's position, so they could only temporarily lower their heads to avoid the bullets.
0:45:10|0:45:23|At the entrance of the tunnel, as the heavy machine gun stopped firing, the enemy soldiers who had previously been lying down immediately got up and advanced again. The soldiers at the tunnel entrance, regardless of their own lives, continued to shoot at the risk of their lives, making every effort to stop the enemy from attacking Wusheng Mountain.
0:45:26|0:45:35|Standing aside, Wang Lan looked around and quickly took his water bottle off his neck, handing it to [Zhang Zhongfa]. [Zhang Zhongfa] took a sip of water and returned the bottle to Wang Lan.
0:45:40|0:45:59|[Zhang Zhongfa] rolled up his sleeves and personally stood at the entrance of a tunnel, directing the battle. The soldiers lined up in the tunnel, each with a determined look on their faces. There were only two machine guns at the entrance of the tunnel, one of which was not shielded. The soldier operating it had his upper body completely exposed to the enemy's guns.
0:46:0|0:46:21|Whenever the soldier operating the machine gun was hit, [Zhang Zhongfa] would wave his hand to signal someone to take his place. The soldiers all understood that stepping forward to fill the gap meant a high risk of being hit by bullets. But they hesitated not at all. As soon as the platoon leader waved his hand, they quickly took off the guns hanging on their bodies, and lay down at the entrance of the trench to intercept the enemy.
0:46:21|0:46:25|A soldier hit the enemy, but soon he was also shot by the enemy.
0:46:43|0:46:58|The machine gunners at other tunnel entrances were also extremely brave. Despite the large number of enemy troops, under the fierce artillery fire of the Eighth Company, they became disorganized, abandoned the attack on Wusheng Mountain, and ran down the mountain.
0:46:58|0:47:6|At that moment, the hillside was in chaos, with enemy soldiers not having a unified retreat route, fleeing in all directions like headless flies.
0:47:14|0:47:34|Looking down from the mountain, the hills are covered with enemy corpses. Inside the trench, [Zhang Zhongfa] carries the severely wounded soldier for treatment. Soldiers who are unable to shoot due to injuries sit on the ground loading bullets for the machine gun. Even the injured commander [Meng Degui], whose eyes are injured, is also fumbling to load bullets.
0:47:34|0:47:43|Everyone worked together, with Zhang Zhongfa, Chen Dehou, Meng Degui, and Yang Decai leading the charge on the front lines, while others raced against time to complete logistical tasks.
0:48:28|0:48:38|[Commander] put down the phone. [Commander], Political Commissar, and Chief of Staff all laughed. [Commander] picked up the phone.
0:48:47|0:48:50|The mayor walked back to the office with the political commissar's arm around his shoulder.
0:49:14|0:49:22|The mayor, the director of the Korean People's Army, called, and [General Chen] walked over to answer the phone.
0:49:28|0:49:43|[Commander] hung up the phone. Captain Huang called to report that their troops were ready and prepared to cooperate with the tunnel troops to retake the main peak position tonight. The Chief of Staff reported to [Commander], who furrowed his brow and walked a few steps with his hands behind his back.
0:50:48|0:51:16|The chief of staff nodded in agreement. Inside the tunnel, [Zhang Zhongfa] said to [Chen Dehou], at this moment, [Yang Decai] forcefully climbed into the tunnel. Several soldiers saw a leg hanging down at the tunnel entrance, hurried forward to drag the person in, [Yang Decai] wiped his sweat and checked the water bottle.
0:51:40|0:51:53|[Yang Decai] took out a letter from his chest and handed it to [Zhang Zhongfa]. [Zhang Zhongfa] unfolded the letter, took it to the candlelight to read, and all the soldiers gathered around to listen to [Zhang Zhongfa] read the letter. [Meng Degui] walked over with the support of Wang Lan and Mao Sihai.
0:52:41|0:52:45|[Meng Degui] was supported to walk in front of [Zhang Zhongfa], then turned to the soldiers and spoke.
0:53:12|0:53:20|Several soldiers raised their hands and looked at each other. Wang Lan and several soldiers also raised their hands.
0:54:1|0:54:23|Under the leadership of [Zhang Zhongfa] and [Meng Degui], work in the tunnel is proceeding briskly. Some soldiers are collecting ammunition, some are nailing nails into the rock walls, some are cleaning, and some are organizing supplies. They are preparing for a long-term stay in the tunnel.
0:54:23|0:54:29|Posters are pasted on the walls of the tunnel, and firearms are neatly arranged on the ground.
0:54:33|0:54:49|After a soldier made the bed for the platoon leader, he curiously put on the headphones and started adjusting them while the walkie-talkie operator wasn't paying attention. When the walkie-talkie operator noticed, he walked over and tapped the soldier on the back of his head, taking the headphones off his head.
0:54:53|0:55:12|[Wang Lan] handed the collected water kettle to two soldiers, who poured the water from the kettle into a large water tank. After cleaning up, the Seventh Company officially began their life in the tunnel. Two soldiers stood guard at the entrance of the tunnel, keeping a close eye on the situation below the mountain, while one of them played the flute quietly.
0:55:18|0:55:33|Soldiers are sewing clothes, reading books, chatting, sitting around tables playing cards, chess, and telling stories.
0:55:33|0:55:46|[Zhang Zhongfa] sat by the bed of Commander [Meng Degui], reading a letter to him. Meanwhile, several soldiers were playing with a squirrel. [Wang Lan] poured water while singing a song, and the soldiers gathered around, smiling and listening to him sing.
0:57:3|0:57:16|The screen shows the magnificent mountains and rivers of our country, under the blue sky and white clouds, the Great Wall stretches for thousands of miles, winding and twisting, with the Yellow River and the Yangtze River rolling along.
0:57:41|0:57:54|In the valley lies a dam, with water pouring out from the floodgate. A vertical dock has been built at the port to increase the speed of loading and unloading of goods for ships.
0:57:57|0:58:25|In the city, factories stand tall, with white smoke billowing out of towering chimneys. Soldiers are immersed in singing. [Yang Decai] walks over carrying a water jug.
0:59:6|0:59:8|The soldiers all started singing along.
0:59:46|0:59:49|[Meng Degui] smiled and started humming softly. [Zhang Zhongfa] also started singing along.
1:0:17|1:0:42|[Wang Lan] hung the water bottles provided by the soldiers on the rack made of tree branches, with [Yang Decai] following behind him, handing him three water bottles. [Wang Lan] smiled as he took the water bottles. [Meng Degui] fell asleep, and [Zhang Zhongfa] quietly left. Seeing the platoon leader leave, [Yang Decai] said to [Wang Lan].
1:0:57|1:1:2|Wang Lan squatted down to continue watering, with [Yang Decai] squatting beside him.
1:2:44|1:2:48|Wang Lan covered her face and shook her head repeatedly.
1:3:10|1:3:18|[Zhang Zhongfa] walked over, and [Yang Decai] quickly shook his head.
1:4:7|1:4:28|[Zhang Zhongfa] turned and left, while Wang Lan lowered her head in thought. The candle was blown out by the wind, and the soldiers woke up from their dreams. A soldier with bandages on his head lit the candle, and smoke filled the tunnel entrance. [Chen Dehou] walked into the tunnel.
1:4:39|1:4:58|Enemy troops were shooting at the tunnel entrance, and [Zhang Zhongfa] heard the machine gun fire and rushed towards the entrance. Suddenly, the enemy soldiers lying in ambush outside threw a bundle of explosives into the tunnel. [Zhang Zhongfa] lifted the explosives, charged forward, and snatched the bundle. He quickly ran to the tunnel entrance and forcefully threw the explosives out.
1:5:3|1:5:12|Later, [Chen Dehou] leaned against a soldier, and Wang Lan poured him a glass of water. [Chen Dehou] took a sip of water and said.
1:5:21|1:5:29|[Zhang Zhongfa] heard the sound of machine gun fire, ran to the entrance of the tunnel, lay down and looked outside. Several bullets hit the rock wall outside the tunnel, [Zhang Zhongfa] quickly buried his head.
1:5:34|1:5:42|[Zhang Zhongfa] lay on his back, grabbing the edge of the tunnel entrance, and peered upwards. He saw many bunkers built on the mountain above the tunnel. [Zhang Zhongfa] walked back into the tunnel.
1:6:4|1:6:8|At night, [Zhang Zhongfa] lay at the entrance of the tunnel with two others to observe the situation.
1:6:32|1:6:50|After making sure there were no enemies lying in wait, they quickly slipped out of the tunnel entrance with hand grenades in hand. They cautiously crawled forward. When the searchlight shone over, they stopped and buried their heads. Suddenly, a soldier accidentally touched an empty tin can on the ground.
1:6:50|1:6:56|The enemy quickly started shooting, and the three soldiers had to roll to dodge and retreat back into the tunnel.
1:7:2|1:7:20|[Zhang Zhongfa] pushed him angrily, then went to pull an injured soldier into the tunnel. Wang Lan stepped forward to support the wounded soldier, and Mao Sihai also returned.
1:7:20|1:7:31|[Zhang Zhongfa] waved his hand, walked to the entrance of the tunnel to take a look outside, then turned around and looked at the scattered empty cans inside the tunnel, coming up with a plan. He picked up an empty can, examined it, then walked to the tunnel entrance and threw it out, immediately followed by gunshots outside. After a while, [Zhang Zhongfa] threw another one out.
1:8:6|1:8:21|At night, [Yang Decai] sat at the entrance of the tunnel, feeling drowsy. Every now and then, he would throw an empty can outside. Inside the tunnel, the soldiers leaned on each other and slept in a haphazard manner. Mao Sihai leaned on [Zhang Zhongfa]'s shoulder and fell asleep as well.
1:8:33|1:8:54|[Zhang Zhongfa] suddenly woke up, he glanced at his watch and it was already 2 a.m. [Zhang Zhongfa] shifted his body, waking up Mao Sihai, and took him to the entrance of the tunnel. [Yang Decai] was still throwing away empty cans, [Zhang Zhongfa] instructed.
1:8:57|1:9:4|[Zhang Zhongfa] crawled out of the tunnel with Mao Sihai. [Yang Decai] took a while to suddenly come to his senses during this moment.
1:9:33|1:9:56|The two climbed near the bunkers, took advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness, and quickly threw grenades, destroying both bunkers. [Chen Dehou] and [Yang Decai] anxiously waited at the tunnel entrance, while [Zhang Zhongfa] safely brought Mao Sihai back to the tunnel. He triumphantly said to [Chen Dehou].
1:10:12|1:10:16|[Zhang Zhongfa] frowned, and at the meeting [Chen Dehou] spoke.
1:10:36|1:10:43|[Zhang Zhongfa] stood up and answered the phone. Inside the command room of the camp.
1:11:3|1:11:8|Think about it, [Zhang Zhongfa] looks at the soldiers.
1:11:34|1:11:37|A soldier chuckled and poked [Yang Decai].
1:11:55|1:12:6|We should educate him well. In the face of this brutal struggle, we need a high level of intelligence and technical skills. [Zhang Zhongfa] hung up the phone and walked up to [Chen Dehou].
1:12:37|1:12:49|[Zhang Zhongfa] walks towards [Yang Decai]. [Zhang Zhongfa] stands on a high ground, and the soldiers gather around.
1:13:4|1:13:23|In the following days, various tunnel units started to take action. Soldiers shuttled through the tunnels, throwing grenades at the enemy from different directions. During the day, the enemy constantly moved sandbags to fortify their bunkers.
1:13:45|1:13:48|After a round of artillery fire, the enemy troops continued to fortify their bunkers.
1:13:52|1:14:2|The Balan soldiers lined up before setting off, and the [commander] handed them a water bottle. Each person only took a small sip before passing the bottle to the next person.
1:14:25|1:14:52|At night, small teams from various tunnel organizations launched attacks, blowing up bunkers and gathering intelligence on the enemy. In this way, for every bunker the enemy built, [Zhang Zhongfa] would blow up one, keeping the enemy on edge and restless at night. Meanwhile, the follow-up troops and ammunition supplies were rushing to the front line at full speed.
1:14:53|1:15:13|In the smoke of gunpowder, a train carrying cannons roars past. Trucks loaded with supplies speed along winding mountain roads. Amidst the hail of bullets, soldiers carrying weapons and Korean women carrying bags march forward, braving the rugged terrain.
1:15:19|1:15:24|As time passed, water became increasingly precious in the tunnel.
1:15:32|1:15:42|The battle log of 1952 recorded that on October 25th, the tunnel unit indeed held the enemy tightly on these two hills.
1:15:44|1:15:46|At this moment, [Commander] stood in front of two rows of soldiers.
1:16:14|1:16:17|[Mayor] handed him two apples. The soldiers set off with supplies of dry rations and ammunition. Along the way, the enemy's artillery fire was fierce.
1:17:37|1:17:49|With the help of two soldiers, Lao Wang finally crawled into the tunnel with the supplies. Several soldiers ran over.
1:18:6|1:18:10|Zhang Zhongfa walked in the old Wangchao tunnel, and the soldier next to him asked him.
1:18:32|1:18:41|Old Wang looked [Zhang Zhongfa] up and down, while the soldiers watched them. Old Wang pulled [Zhang Zhongfa] aside and patted his shoulder. He took out two apples wrapped in paper from his pocket, opened the paper, and handed the apples to [Zhang Zhongfa].
1:19:0|1:19:2|[Zhang Zhongfa] took the apple.
1:19:26|1:19:31|[Zhang Zhongfa] handed the apple to Wang Lan, who happily ran off. [Yang Decai] hurried to chase after him. [Yang Decai] patted his neck, and Wang Lan ran to [Meng Degui]'s bedside. [Meng Degui] sniffed the apple in front of his nose.
1:19:56|1:19:58|[Zhang Zhongfa] handed an apple to the wounded soldier lying beside him. The soldier handed the apple back.
1:20:27|1:20:29|Lao Wang was chatting with the soldiers, and he took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket.
1:20:51|1:20:55|Lao Wang handed the cigarette to a soldier sitting next to him, and the soldiers passed it on, taking out cigarettes and lighting them up to smoke together.
1:21:20|1:21:23|Wang Lan walked over. Zhang Zhongfa looked at the apple.
1:21:50|1:21:57|Lao Wang lowered his head, and [Zhang Zhongfa] looked at the sack full of radishes.
1:22:8|1:22:13|Soldiers transporting supplies, one after another, rushed from the camp to the tunnel.
1:22:15|1:22:44|In a heavily targeted area by the enemy, over a dozen soldiers sacrificed their lives there, with bodies piled up like small hills. The battle log of 1952 recorded that on October 30th, the enemy tightly controlled the entrance of the tunnel, completely cutting off the connection to the rear. The water inside the tunnel decreased day by day.
1:23:0|1:23:6|At night, two soldiers shook hands with [Zhang Zhongfa] and crawled out of the tunnel cautiously.
1:23:9|1:23:29|One soldier carrying several small water bottles and a rifle, while another holding a hand grenade and a water tank with a searchlight constantly sweeping back and forth. In order to avoid exposure, every crawl of the soldiers was extremely difficult. Finally, they arrived at the edge of a pond filled with corpses.
1:23:41|1:24:0|They urgently used their hands to scoop up water and feed it into their mouths. At this moment, a gun emerged between the sandbags beside them. Our soldier, Zhang Zhongfa, was unaware as they quickly took out a large water bottle to fill it with water. The gun fired a bullet, and our soldier was fatally shot.
1:24:1|1:24:24|The newly filled water jug spilled next to the soldier, water gushing out. In the tunnel, water seeped down from the rock walls, and the soldiers lined up, tilting their heads and opening their mouths to catch the water. One of the soldiers tried to pry open the rock wall with his injured hand, but failed. He licked his lips and walked away disappointed.
1:24:29|1:24:48|The soldiers were so thirsty that they couldn't speak, their lips cracked, their eyes staring blankly, sitting on the ground resting against the mountain wall. A soldier gently wiped his lips with a cloth soaked in water, then handed the wet cloth to his comrade beside him.
1:25:0|1:25:13|[Zhang Zhongfa] and [Chen Dehou] were resting side by side. [Zhang Zhongfa] licked his lips and sat up slightly straight. Seeing everyone winking, he lay back down.
1:26:1|1:26:6|He lifted [Chen Dehou] up, and [Chen Dehou] smiled and took off his hat.
1:26:9|1:26:18|[Chen Dehou] placed the box beside him, stepped on it with one foot, touched his chin with his left hand, tapped the box with his right hand, and shook his head.
1:27:1|1:27:4|Run forward, and when you reach under that tree, you see those plums are round and big, but they are more green than yellow. Everyone couldn't care less whether they are ripe or not, they just pick them and take a bite. The moment they bite down, they feel the sourness seeping through their teeth, gums, cheeks, and under their tongue, a mouthful of extremely sour juice.
1:27:32|1:27:37|The soldiers sat up straight, listening attentively. [Chen Dehou] put on his hat and lay down. [Zhang Zhongfa] smiled and looked at [Chen Dehou]. The soldiers also started chatting.
1:29:37|1:29:43|Yang Decai lay on the side behind [Zhang Zhongfa], writing in his diary. [Yang Decai] rolled over.
1:30:1|1:30:3|[Zhang Zhongfa] imagined and smiled contentedly. The soldiers gathered in groups of three or four, some were helping their comrades mend their clothes.
1:30:30|1:30:34|[Meng Degui] was fantasizing while nibbling on dry rations, and ended up choking on them.
1:31:32|1:31:35|Picking up the alarm clock on the bedside table, he looked at the time. [Wang Lan] tidied up the quilt for [Meng Degui]. [Wang Lan] sat down.
1:32:3|1:32:5|[Meng Degui] put his hand on Wang Lan's shoulder, Wang Lan thought for a moment, and then said no.
1:33:27|1:33:30|At home, [Meng Degui] shook his head and smiled.
1:35:3|1:35:9|Wang Lan raised her head sorrowfully, exchanged a glance with a merchant supporting [Meng Degui], furrowing her brows in contemplation. At this moment, [Zhang Zhongfa] and [Chen Dehou] were sitting side by side on the edge of the bed.
1:35:58|1:36:9|He looked around, picked up a pack of cookies next to him, broke it in half, and handed one half to [Chen Dehou].
1:36:29|1:36:45|[Zhang Zhongfa] had cracked lips and struggled to eat the biscuits. The biscuits were too dry, and he hadn't had any water for days, making chewing very difficult. Swallowing was even more challenging, with biscuit crumbs constantly falling out of [Zhang Zhongfa]'s mouth.
1:36:45|1:36:50|[Chen Dehou] and [Yang Decai], along with other soldiers, watched as the platoon leader ate in pain, all furrowing their brows.
1:36:53|1:36:59|But in the end, Zhang Zhongfa managed to swallow the biscuit. He smiled and patted Chen Dehou's thigh.
1:37:30|1:37:48|[Zhang Zhongfa] lowered his head in discomfort. Outside the tunnel, a soldier carried a water tank on his back, dodged enemy shells on the ground, then threw a grenade at the enemy before immediately rushing into the tunnel. The soldiers inside the tunnel rushed to the entrance to help.
1:37:54|1:38:2|[Zhang Zhongfa] walks over, the soldier salutes. [Zhang Zhongfa] shakes his hand and leads him into the tunnel. [Wang Lan] is smiling and filling water with a few soldiers, then suddenly stands up.
1:38:27|1:38:36|Several soldiers carrying buckets followed [Wang Lan] to [Meng Degui]'s bedside. [Zhang Zhongfa] handed a porcelain cup of sugar water to the commander, and all the soldiers gathered around. [Zhang Zhongfa] sat down by [Meng Degui]'s bedside.
1:39:29|1:39:34|Five battles, a plate of fried noodles, a handful of blood.
1:40:44|1:40:52|[Meng Degui] slowly raised his hand, wanting to remove the bandage from his eyes. [Wang Lan] stood up and gently removed the bandage wrapped around the instructor's head.
1:41:47|1:42:5|The soldiers all took off their hats and observed a moment of silence, facing the sudden passing of Instructor [Meng Degui]. On the faces of soldiers like [Zhang Zhongfa] and [Chen Dehou], there was nothing but sorrow.
1:42:46|1:42:54|[Meng Degui], with his eyes tightly closed, lay quietly on the hospital bed, only his eyes moving.
1:43:40|1:43:54|On the other side, the enemy is digging above the tunnel, trying to break through. Inside the tunnel, soldiers are holding guns, ready for action. Soil keeps falling from above the tunnel, and [Zhang Zhongfa] listens to the noise above his head.
1:44:31|1:44:57|The enemy blew up the tunnel. They threw gas bombs into the tunnel, and soldiers picked up machine guns to shoot outward from the hole blown open by the enemy. [Zhang Zhongfa] shouted. [Zhang Zhongfa] quickly put on a mask, bent down, wetted a towel with water, and distributed it to the soldiers. The soldiers covered the mouths of the severely wounded with the towels.
1:45:1|1:45:18|The towel is not enough, [Wang Lan] took off her own mask and handed it to the soldier. The soldier operating the machine gun didn't have a mask and was overcome by the gas. [Zhang Zhongfa] ran over, took the machine gun, held his breath, and fired outward from the blasted hole.
1:45:18|1:45:25|[Wang Lan] was about to tie a towel around his face when he turned and saw [Zhang Zhongfa], quickly approaching and covering his mouth and nose with the towel.
1:45:39|1:45:52|The artillery received a message and fired at the enemy above the trench, driving them away. [Wang Lan] fainted, and [Zhang Zhongfa] helped him up.
1:45:55|1:45:59|At this moment, [Wang Lan] leaned on [Yang Decai], with everyone gathered around him. [Zhang Zhongfa] stood in front of him, while [Wang Lan] took a sip of water.
1:46:51|1:47:12|[Zhang Zhongfa] and [Chen Dehou] embraced each other excitedly, lifted up by the enthusiastic soldiers. The soldiers hugged each other, some even rolling on the ground, while others took off their hats and waved them. [Wang Lan] joyfully pounded [Yang Decai]'s chest, as the soldiers wiped their machine guns and bullet casings.
1:47:20|1:47:44|Wang Lan was shocked, waving his fists in the air, but saw the platoon leader turn around to wipe his tears, leaving everyone stunned. Back at the camp, the [commander] tightly embraced [Zhang Zhongfa], joyfully patting his back, while Zheng Wei watched from the side, tears glistening in his eyes.
1:47:44|1:47:51|[Commander] patted Zhang Zhongfa on the shoulder, then walked up to Yang Decai.
1:48:9|1:48:24|[Yang Decai] shyly lowered his head. The [commander] led [Zhang Zhongfa] to the wall. Zheng Wei pulled back the curtain, revealing a map of the situation.
1:49:39|1:49:45|Lao Wang put his arm around [Yang Decai]. In the room, [Zhang Zhongfa] and [Yang Decai] were sleeping on the same bed.
1:50:4|1:50:15|The two men were still asleep when [Commander] walked in, sat down on the chair beside their bed, and started massaging their hands and feet.
1:50:22|1:50:40|[Yang Decai] placed his hand on [Zhang Zhongfa]'s body, but [Zhang Zhongfa] removed his arm and turned over. The [commander] glanced at his watch, stood up, and walked to the bedside of [Zhang Zhongfa]. [Zhang Zhongfa] immediately got up and put on his coat.
1:51:12|1:51:24|[Yang Decai] also woke up. You will understand very clearly that the main peak is the key position of the entire battlefield. If we fail to capture it on time, [Zhang Zhongfa] nods solemnly.
1:51:47|1:52:6|The battle quickly began. The artillery of the volunteers reached an unprecedented scale. On the two hills of less than four square kilometers in Shangganling, the volunteers brought in the Second Artillery Division and other artillery units, concentrating more than 170 large and medium-caliber guns, as well as 24 Katyusha rocket launchers.
1:52:8|1:52:26|The volunteer army is well prepared and determined to win. The cannons on the hillside keep firing shells towards the enemy positions without stopping. Relying on the air superiority controlled by fighter jets, the enemy forces are suppressed and defeated by the fierce artillery fire of the volunteer army. Thick smoke covers the sky, and enemy soldiers are frantically fleeing on the mountain.
1:52:27|1:52:44|[Zhang Zhongfa] returned to the tunnel. Outside, the gunfire was intense, but inside the tunnel, the soldiers were either eating, drinking water or alcohol, or smoking and resting, looking calm and fearless, preparing to support the final counterattack of the troops.
1:53:2|1:53:27|It's almost six o'clock, [Zhang Zhongfa] and the soldiers are lined up in a column at the entrance of the tunnel, each soldier firmly looking ahead. Under the smoke of gunpowder, their skin is rough and dark, their wrinkled military uniforms covered with Chinese characters, mud spots, and bloodstains. But they look so lovely and respectable.
1:53:34|1:53:52|A soldier placed a small squirrel in the palm of [Wang Lan], who smiled as he climbed up his arm. [Zhang Zhongfa] frowned and glanced at his watch. There were ten seconds left until six o'clock. With a wave of his hand, the soldiers immediately rushed out of the tunnel.
1:54:50|1:55:5|[Zhang Zhongfa] looked at his watch, took the water bottle, and drank a big gulp of water. On the hillside, [Chen Dehou] led the soldiers to continue the assault. The higher they went, the more intense the enemy's firepower became. Upon reaching Area 2, casualties began to increase significantly. [Chen Dehou] lay on the ground and looked up to scout the enemy situation.
1:55:5|1:55:14|In the main peak cliff, the enemy's newly built bunker is continuously firing at the assault team. The assault teams of the Eighth Company and other companies can only collectively lie down and cannot advance.
1:55:15|1:55:28|Chen Dehou sent two soldiers to plant explosives, but they were shot before taking a few steps. Zhang Zhongfa checked his watch, it was already 7:30. Chen Dehou then sent two more soldiers up the mountain for the explosion, but they were also shot by the enemy. The second explosive team failed again.
1:55:48|1:56:12|[Zhang Zhongfa] looked down at his watch, it was 7:45. He paced anxiously. [Yang Decai] watched the company commander with a worried expression. On the hill where the battalion headquarters was located, the [division commander] observed the battle through binoculars, his expression equally anxious. The chief of staff came over to report that the third explosion in the tunnel had failed again.
1:56:14|1:56:20|[Zhang Zhongfa] looked at [Yang Decai], thought for a moment, [Yang Decai] put down his gun, took off the grenade on his body, water bottle, straightened his hat, saluted to [Zhang Zhongfa], and then set off. [Zhang Zhongfa] saluted back to him.
1:56:48|1:57:12|Yang Decai rushed out of the tunnel with an explosive barrel in hand. He stood on the hillside, shouting into the tunnel. Yang Decai and Mao Sihai dodged enemy snipers, constantly charging towards the mountaintop. They alternated between sprinting and rolling on the ground, moving swiftly and agilely.
1:57:18|1:57:37|[Zhang Zhongfa] and Wang Lan walked out of the tunnel by chance. They hid behind cover to observe the situation. [Yang Decai] continued to charge forward, while Mao Sihai found a suitable position to lie down, setting up a machine gun in the rear to cover him. Mao Sihai was hit.
1:57:40|1:58:0|[Yang Decai] glanced back at Mao Sihai, and as he stood up, he was also hit in the chest. He struggled to lift his head and crawled forward with difficulty. Mao Sihai, enduring intense pain, continued to use the machine gun to clear the way for [Yang Decai].
1:58:2|1:58:23|[Yang Decai] gritted his teeth and held his chest as he continued to run up, hit by a bullet once again. He fell behind a breakthrough, and [Commander] glanced at his watch, only five minutes left until eight o'clock. [Zhang Zhongfa] also anxiously clenched his fists, as bullet after bullet hit Mao Sihai, who weakly buried his head.
1:58:23|1:58:28|He made another effort to lift his head and adjust the machine gun, but he still fell down.
1:59:9|1:59:28|At this moment, [Zhang Zhongfa] set up a heavy machine gun in the rear, sweeping towards the bunker to share the firepower for [Yang Decai]. With the cover of [Zhang Zhongfa], [Yang Decai] suddenly stood up, quickly ran towards the bunker. He unscrewed the cover of the fuse, pulled out the igniter, and stuffed the explosive barrel into the machine gun hole of the bunker.
1:59:28|1:59:39|But the explosive barrel was quickly thrown out of the bunker by the enemy. [Yang Decai] climbed up the bunker again, he forcefully stuffed the explosive barrel into the bunker, using his own body to block the machine gun hole.
1:59:42|2:0:2|In the final moment of life, [Yang Decai] turned around and shouted. [Zhang Zhongfa] gave the order, and all soldiers began to charge. With no more obstacles from the bunkers, the commander's counterattack was unstoppable. The hillside was densely packed with [commander]. Mao Sihai watched as his comrades charged towards the peak, and closed his eyes.
2:0:10|2:0:27|Finally, the soldiers holding the big flag reached the mountaintop, kicked away the enemy's flag, and planted our army's tattered flag on the mountaintop. [Zhang Zhongfa] successfully completed the mission and handed over the position to a soldier from the follow-up troops.
2:0:36|2:0:56|[Zhang Zhongfa] saluted the soldier, and the commander, political commissar, and chief of staff also led the soldiers to the position. [Zhang Zhongfa] gathered the soldiers to assemble at the mountaintop.
2:1:2|2:1:20|[Zhang Zhongfa] saluted to the [commander], the political commissar, and the chief of staff standing in front of the formation, reviewing this heroic company. Along with platoon leader [Chen Dehou], section leader Wang Lan, the 8th Company now only had nine soldiers left.
2:1:29|2:1:57|[Commander] looked back and forth at the faces of the soldiers, unable to speak for a long time. He walked up to the soldiers, shaking hands solemnly with each of them. After experiencing this life-and-death battle, the soldiers remained spirited, with a resolute expression, standing straight with their guns. [Wang Lan] was at the end of the line.
2:2:9|2:2:27|[Commander] shook hands with [Wang Lan], then walked up to [Zhang Zhongfa] and shook his hand. [Zhang Zhongfa] had two water bottles hanging on him. [Commander] understood that [Yang Decai] had sacrificed himself. He looked sad and glanced at the eight soldiers.
2:2:35|2:3:0|[Zhang Zhongfa] led the troops down the mountain, and everyone walked to a big tree with smiles on their faces. [Wang Lan] released a small squirrel, which climbed up the tree trunk. It was written in the battle log of 1952.
2:3:11|2:3:16|The battle log is closed, and our movie ends here.
