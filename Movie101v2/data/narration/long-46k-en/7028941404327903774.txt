0:1:35|0:1:48|Wearing casual denim clothes, he obviously stood out from the crowd dressed in traditional attire. As a special agent intelligence officer, [Bill] had already disguised himself as a security guard. He saw [Mouse] coming in and quietly approached a woman waiting in line for inspection.
0:2:4|0:2:10|At this point, [Bill] had already switched the cards, and [Mouse] teased while holding the card.
0:2:17|0:2:33|As soon as the words fell, [Mouse] smoothly inserted the card into the reader, fingers quickly tapping on the keyboard. Soon, the identity information on the card was changed. [Mouse] revealed a satisfied smile. Subsequently, the chief agent [Lion King] successfully infiltrated with the new identity card.
0:2:40|0:2:48|[Lion King] looked around cautiously before swiping the card to enter the room, and he greeted the receptionist inside proactively.
0:4:19|0:4:29|In the room, [Lion King] stood up and glared fiercely at his assistant who was contradicting him.
0:4:50|0:5:2|[Ma Wen] pushed the other party aside and walked towards the door. The man who stayed in the room stood still, then took out his phone from his pocket and started pressing buttons.
0:5:24|0:5:39|The scene shifts to the music hall, the vast venue filled with people. [Lion King] sits in front of the piano, ready to perform. As the music starts, [Lion King]'s fingers start moving along.
0:5:41|0:5:50|Accompanied by the enthusiastic invitation of the host, [Lion King] walked onto the stage, waving to the audience. The crystal ball above the music hall and him on the stage became the highlights of the whole scene.
0:6:18|0:6:21|Suddenly, sparks flew on the stage, and [Lion King] looked horrified.
0:6:22|0:6:29|The crystal ball above suddenly plummeted, causing a loud explosion that made the whole audience scream and panic.
0:6:30|0:6:46|Sparks spewed towards the audience, causing a panic as everyone rushed out screaming. The scattered ashes on the stage had already penetrated into the underground parking lot.
0:7:1|0:7:13|The off-road vehicle crashed heavily into the pillar, leaving the security guards who witnessed it dumbfounded. They surrounded the entire vehicle with guns raised. The door opened, and the security guards looked around but found no one inside.
0:7:16|0:7:30|At this moment, in the bullet-riddled music hall, [Lion King] and [Volcano] flip open the piano lid. Bound [Ma Wen] lies inside, bewildered.
0:7:33|0:7:40|[Volcano] grabbed [Ma Wen]'s collar and said, leaving [Ma Wen] wide-eyed in fear.
0:7:45|0:8:7|Three people started to escape with [Ma Wen], taking him away first. [Lion King] picked up a trash can and smashed it at the security guards, while [Volcano] broke through the glass to subdue the guards. Then, he kicked the gun on the ground to [Lion King]. The two cooperated seamlessly to eliminate the threat. At this moment, gunshots were heard from behind, and the two hurriedly ran over.
0:8:8|0:8:21|Approaching closer, [Lion King] was lying paralyzed at the corner with a gunshot wound to the knee, while [Bill] was leaning against the glass door. [Lion King]'s assistant was lying in a pool of blood, holding a gun.
0:8:22|0:8:35|According to [Bill]'s recollection, the two of them ran into the assistant head-on while fleeing. Before they could react, the assistant had already shot [Ma Wen] dead. [Bill] rushed forward to grab the gun, but unexpectedly, in the struggle, the assistant fired another shot at his knee.
0:8:35|0:8:43|He then endured the pain, exerted all his strength to push the assistant down to the ground, and then pressed the gun against the other's chest and fired.
0:8:45|0:8:53|[Lion King] supported the limping [Bill] as they ran out, with [Volcano] providing cover. After the mission failed, the five of them escaped the desert by car. Inside the car,
0:8:54|0:9:5|[Mouse] bandages [Bill]'s wound with a bandage, causing [Bill] to grimace in pain. At that moment, on the car's TV screen, the leader angrily holds everyone accountable.
0:9:12|0:9:21|The remote-locked vehicle was unlocked, and [Bill] got out of the car limping, slamming the door shut.
0:9:53|0:10:17|The jokes without weight cannot offset the brotherhood that binds everyone together. The endless desert ahead seems to have no end, just like everyone's future. With a few gunshots, the four golden words "Lion King Brothers" are displayed on the wall like a brand.
0:10:17|0:10:33|The film officially begins, set 5 years later. In the scene, a sprawling African refugee camp constructed with white cloth fills the land. Children's faces are full of innocence, some snuggled in their mother's arms, others playing with their friends.
0:10:33|0:10:40|The doctor in a white coat crosses paths with volunteers in this tender scene, bringing a sense of security to people.
0:10:50|0:11:4|[Lion King] gets off the car, smiles and high-fives the little girl. The girl holds his hand and runs to the tent, where Doctor Zhou is conducting an examination. He encourages the girl while helping her up slowly.
0:11:4|0:11:19|The girl was very scared, she looked up at Dr. Zhou, who then smiled and comforted the nervous little girl. [Lion King] looked at the woman in front of him and gradually became fascinated, he stood still in place, enjoying the beauty of this moment.
0:11:20|0:11:27|Dr. Zhou seemed to have noticed something, turned his head, exchanged a smile with Lion King, and then walked out of the tent.
0:11:45|0:11:53|Dr. Zhou took out a bottle of medicine from the box and examined it carefully, suddenly his face changed.
0:11:55|0:12:15|[Lion King] lowered his head and dared not look at Dr. Zhou. Then he walked out of the tent and picked up his phone to make a call. Meanwhile, [Bill] was accompanied by a beautiful woman, having a great time.
0:12:53|0:12:59|The Lion King stood still with a solemn expression, then the two of them came to the lakeside to enjoy a peaceful time.
0:13:16|0:13:21|[Lion King] smiled and took out a necklace from his pocket, gently putting it on Zhou Doctor from behind.
0:13:23|0:13:33|Dr. Zhou turned around, feeling the unique necklace, and [Lion King] smiled awkwardly. Suddenly, Dr. Zhou pulled out the mini dagger from the necklace.
0:13:36|0:13:45|Looking at [Lion King] with anticipation, Dr. Zhou's eyes were full of smiles. She turned around, lowered her head, and smiled lightly, touching the self-defense necklace around her neck with both hands.
0:14:2|0:14:9|Dr. Zhou turned around and met the fiery gaze of [Lion King]. [Lion King] pursed his lips and remained silent, just staring at her.
0:14:10|0:14:32|Dr. Zhou turned around and scolded [Lion King] with a smile, then pushed him away and sat down. She took off her shoes neatly and threw them aside, then put her bare feet into the lake to splash around. [Lion King] sat down beside her. Dr. Zhou leaned against his strong shoulder, and at that moment, ripples appeared on the calm lake surface.
0:14:56|0:15:6|When they arrived in Budapest, Hungary at the agreed time, the four of them saw [Bill] standing in front of a luxury sports car, admiring himself as they neared their destination.
0:15:20|0:15:25|The four of them hid quietly, but were discovered by [Bill] who turned around, and he quickly ran towards them.
0:15:49|0:16:5|The waiter led them to the luxurious yacht, and several of them were holding [Lion King]'s phone, ready to take photos, when suddenly the phone rang.
0:17:58|0:18:3|[Bill] opened a bottle of red wine, and everyone cheered and clapped.
0:18:40|0:18:47|In the room, [Bill] is playing a racing game, his cold eyes staring ahead, hands tightly gripping the steering wheel to control the direction.
0:18:48|0:19:2|[Volcano] walked in silently from behind, watching [Bill] who was completely focused on playing the game. He pulled down the racing driver's lever, putting an end to the game. [Bill] ignored him and continued to play with the steering wheel.
0:19:12|0:19:28|After speaking, [Bill] ignored [Volcano] and walked straight to the railing. Sensing something amiss, [Volcano] followed. Meanwhile, the atmosphere downstairs was getting more lively.
0:19:33|0:19:53|The [Volcano] and [Bill] embraced on the second floor instantly bounced apart. The next day, everyone arrived at an abandoned factory. The rolling shutter slowly rose, and the five tall figures gradually appeared. They walked in with their heads held high.
0:21:9|0:21:22|By the roadside, [Sir Cao] disguised as a maintenance worker is dealing with excess roadblocks, while [Lai Si]'s assistant opens the door and looks around vigilantly. He then watches the delivery truck leave with his own eyes.
0:21:58|0:22:4|On the street, the delivery truck was moving steadily forward, followed closely by a helicopter in the air.
0:22:5|0:22:22|On the other side, [Bill] stepped on the gas pedal and sped away, then found the right moment to forcefully turn the steering wheel. The car drifted, crashing into a fire hydrant. Water gushed out recklessly, foam covering the road as motorcycles unable to brake in time slipped and fell on the foamy surface.
0:22:22|0:22:27|Foam on the ground is stirred up into the sky, and the children on the roadside laugh and play with the foam.
0:22:40|0:22:52|After encountering a roadblock, Lion King's delivery van, driven by Bill, quickly came up with a prepared solution. The team led by Lion King clearly marked the new route, and the delivery driver immediately followed it after this small incident.
0:23:0|0:23:14|The helicopter immediately changed its route to escort the delivery truck. As the delivery truck was about to enter the tunnel, the helicopter above reported the situation to [Lai Si].
0:23:48|0:24:6|Due to interference, the delivery van lost its location information after entering the tunnel. The helicopter behind them sent a notification that they were preparing to fly to the tunnel exit to wait. Every member of the Rice team stared at the computer screen intently, becoming visibly nervous in the face of the uncontrollable situation.
0:24:14|0:24:23|Everyone waited calmly for the arrival of the delivery truck after receiving the instructions, and [Lion King] never took his eyes off the tracking system.
0:24:58|0:25:12|The plane rapidly descended, forcing the disobedient delivery van to stop in the middle of the road. The commander and the pilot jumped out of the plane, pointing their guns as they ran towards the van. The people inside the van looked on in fear at the two approaching aggressively.
0:25:32|0:25:42|The scene cuts to the driver's memory, where a strangely dressed man approaches the delivery man who is eating a hamburger. He holds a stack of money and asks the delivery man if he wants to make some extra cash.
0:25:50|0:26:0|The man told him the agreed time and place, then said thank you in Japanese and waved his hand to leave. The delivery man behind him looked surprised. The commander turned around in anger, his fierce eyes seemed to want to devour someone.
0:26:0|0:26:11|15 minutes ago, [Lulu] followed the plan and threw an iron nail in the middle of the road, causing the driver's tire to be punctured, as reported by Bill.
0:26:25|0:26:31|Lai's delivery van is about to enter the tunnel, followed closely by the truck with graffiti driven by [Lion King], the masked bandit.
0:26:33|0:26:48|The car of [Lion King] had just entered the tunnel when [Sir Cao] immediately blocked it with a maintenance vehicle at the tunnel entrance. He placed a roadblock on the side and gestured to the cars behind. Inside the tunnel, the carriage of [Lion King] was being pulled up by someone.
0:26:48|0:26:55|Wearing a mask, [Volcano] squatted inside, then he pried open the carriage and placed a smoke bomb in the ventilation opening of the delivery van.
0:26:56|0:27:11|Smoke quickly filled the car through the air conditioning, causing Rice's henchman to faint on the steering wheel. Next, the truck blocked the delivery van from behind, and [Volcano] jumped out of the truck door, entered the smoke-filled delivery van, and removed the tracker.
0:27:11|0:27:29|[Lion King] pressed the remote control, and the graffiti truck's compartment moved backward. Then [Volcano] threw a tracker, and [Lion King] gave a thumbs up to [Volcano].
0:27:33|0:27:40|[Lion King] drove away in the truck, leaving [Volcano] to follow. Only Lai Si's men were left lying on the side of the road, unconscious.
0:27:46|0:28:2|Shortly after the [Lion King]'s car arrived, [Dan Ding] took a few steps back, caught the tracker he threw, and quickly returned to place it on a car identical to the delivery van. The tense and exciting perfect car switch plan successfully blinded Rice's eyes.
0:28:2|0:28:11|Commander called Rice to question him, and Rice told the commander.
0:28:18|0:28:34|He promised himself that he would definitely find the car back. At this moment, the [Lion King] who successfully completed the mission returned to the agreed location with the spoils. [Lulu] and [Mouse] had been waiting at the abandoned factory for a long time. The two cars returned safely, and [Mouse] stood by, smiling and giving them a thumbs up.
0:28:48|0:29:2|[Dan Ding] kicked the flattened tire twice and then opened the door of the delivery van, shocking everyone inside. To their surprise, there was a meticulously designed password-protected door inside the van.
0:29:3|0:29:13|Immediately, the knowledgeable [Mouse] picked up the computer and tried to unlock it. The password door opened, and everyone looked inside in astonishment.
0:30:12|0:30:23|Bill stared at Volcano incredulously for a long time, looking around at everyone in front of him, and said angrily.
0:30:44|0:30:52|A car stopped in front of everyone, the door opened, and a person wearing sunglasses got out of the car with two bodyguards.
0:30:54|0:31:0|[Bill] turned around and told Rice.
0:31:30|0:31:36|Volcano was stunned in place, while Lion King fired a shot to signal.
0:31:38|0:31:50|At this moment, Dad panicked and instinctively stepped back, then slumped down at the back of the car, not knowing what to do. As he couldn't match the weapon in his hand, [Volcano] pulled out a grenade from his waist and threw it over.
0:31:52|0:32:4|Dan Ding was covering in the back seat, Mouse was helping Dad walk in front, Old Man deliberately shot and exploded the oil drum, the abandoned car windows splattered everywhere due to the explosion. Everyone hugged their heads and leaped forward, finally escaping from the dangerous place.
0:32:11|0:32:19|[Volcano] provided cover while [Lion King] took out the bullets from the car. After that, [Lion King] threw the bullets to his brothers.
0:32:20|0:32:33|Mouse supported the injured Sir Cao as they escaped, with Dan Ding providing cover fire from behind. Lion King and Volcano hid behind a car, assisting them to leave. Sir Cao, who was shot, had already lost consciousness.
0:32:35|0:32:51|Volcano watched as Sir Cao fainted in front of him, unable to contain his anger any longer, he roared and rushed out to shoot. Dan Ding finally managed to get everyone onto the van at the car transfer platform, bullets flying around them, Dan Ding quickly pulled the switch of the transfer platform.
0:32:56|0:33:7|Seeing the situation, [Dan Ding] immediately activated the iron hook hanging in the air, and the hook swiftly slid and hit the van. The violent impact caused the entire body of the van to overturn on the ground, and [Dan Ding] had to climb out from the window on the other side.
0:33:9|0:33:16|Mouse also came out to help Dan Ding lift the car, while Volcano fired a few shots to cover them and then ran to Lion King's side to switch to a machine gun.
0:33:18|0:33:33|[Dan Ding] took the opportunity to successfully get on the car, while [Volcano] behind provided cover and was shooting wildly with a machine gun. The car transport platform moved slowly, [Dan Ding] anxiously stared, then he started the van, his eyes fixed on the outside of the car.
0:33:33|0:33:42|Only a rapid start-up sound was heard, crashing through the wall and rushing out, leaving Lai Si's henchmen still in shock.
0:33:44|0:33:57|[Lion King] drove the small boat transport plane to pick up [Volcano], who was facing a large group of enemies. [Volcano] aimed at the hydrogen bottles near the enemies and fired his gun. With a deafening roar, the shattered car windows scattered everywhere, and the enemies screamed in agony.
0:33:59|0:34:13|[Volcano] and [Lion King] immediately jumped into the nearest car and escaped. Rice's men started shooting wildly, and the bodyguards got into the car ready to chase after them. Rice ordered them to make sure to take care of them. Beside them, [Bill] stared silently at Rice.
0:34:13|0:34:27|On the road, the enemy's car was in hot pursuit, [Dan Ding] nervously looked in the rearview mirror, only to see [Lion King] and [Volcano] driving behind unable to catch up. The two of them got into a quarrel because they had accidentally injured their father just now.
0:34:30|0:34:38|[Volcano] remained silent with a stern face as a burst of machine gun fire erupted. [Lion King] and [Volcano] exchanged a glance as several cars were closely chasing them from behind.
0:34:38|0:34:50|In an abandoned factory, [Lion King] is standing in front of a delivery truck filled with gold, his hands in his pockets, looking proud of his success. He then turns around and walks towards [Bill].
0:34:59|0:35:10|Bill was then punched hard in the stomach. He bent over in pain, clutching his stomach. Emphasized [Lai Si].
0:35:17|0:35:25|[Rice] kept repeating the warning, [Bill] quickly pulled out a gun and pointed it at him. [Rice] was scared and hid behind the bodyguard, but [Bill] pushed the bodyguard aside and fired the gun.
0:35:26|0:35:39|Rice was shot dead, [Bill] turned his head to look at the bodyguard next to him, who was staring at him, not daring to move. With a cold look in his eyes, he walked closer with a gun in hand.
0:35:45|0:36:0|At this moment, gunshots rang out on the street. [Dan Ding] clenched the steering wheel tightly, trying to keep it steady. [Mouse] stuck his head out and fired at the car behind. On the other side, [Volcano] swerved left and right in the car, while [Lion King] leaned out halfway and fired at the enemies behind.
0:36:2|0:36:9|[Lion King] jumped out of the car, rolled a few times, then immediately got up and drove away the parked vehicles on the side of the road.
0:36:10|0:36:14|He seized the opportunity to change lanes immediately and forcefully collided with the enemy's car.
0:36:16|0:36:22|The vehicles on the road were in chaos, with the [Lion King] driving out, followed by several other cars immediately changing lanes to overtake and catch up.
0:36:26|0:36:46|The scene returns to the airport, where a chaotic explosion site is filled with scattered bodies. A group of men in black are observing around, with Lion King lying there lifeless, and Commander looking at the body with cold eyes. In the tree-lined street, a sudden blare of horns is heard.
0:36:46|0:37:4|[Volcano] is gritting his teeth and driving rapidly, while [Lion King] is dodging attacks from the sides. At this moment, the enemy leans out of the car, weapon in hand, ready to strike. [Lion King] sees the cannon from the rearview mirror, immediately turns the steering wheel, a cannonball quickly fires out, [Lion King] changes direction of travel and successfully avoids it.
0:37:4|0:37:25|The car passing by was engulfed in the intense sound of gunfire, with flames burning along the street. On the other side, the enemy drove forward in front and behind [Volcano], while a tram slowly approached on the street ahead. [Dan Ding] accelerated and passed smoothly. [Volcano] barely made it past by turning in front of the car.
0:37:26|0:37:33|The Lion King, who was charging at the back, couldn't bear to watch any longer. He swung his tail, flipped the car sideways, and the tram was cut off, sliding off the road.
0:37:39|0:37:43|Volcano ordered Dan Ding to leave first, then immediately reversed the car to help Lion King.
0:37:44|0:37:56|However, the tram that was hit was blocking the way in the middle, and the enemies on the other side were shooting at [Lion King]'s car. [Volcano] gritted his teeth, stepped on the gas pedal, and the whole car rushed out along the side iron plate.
0:37:56|0:38:11|At this moment, the pursued [Lion King] is still in a difficult situation. [Lion King] swings the tail of the car, deliberately hitting the parked car on the side of the road, trying to create obstacles. The enemy's car clings tightly and won't let go, causing [Lion King] to furrow his brow.
0:38:11|0:38:25|Suddenly a sign appeared on the side of the road, reminding him. Then, he quickly turned in the new direction, causing pedestrians on the side of the road to scream in fear. The destination was within sight, and he honked the horn as he rushed past.
0:38:30|0:38:35|[Lion King] crashed into the police station, and his enemies behind him dared not make any rash moves. They lingered at the door for a while before leaving.
0:38:37|0:38:42|Volcano, who arrived late, widened his eyes when he saw this scene.
0:38:53|0:39:5|The police immediately pressed him down, handcuffed him, and [Volcano] watched as [Lion King] was arrested. He drove slowly past the police station, constantly looking back at [Lion King]. [Lion King] gestured at him to leave quickly.
0:39:5|0:39:27|After some hesitation, [Volcano] drove away, leaving [Lion King] watching him safely depart, closing his eyes in relief. The scene then shifts to a flashback in [Lion King]'s memory, where he recalls the first time he and his brothers met [Sir Cao], several years ago when [Sir Cao] brought them home from prison.
0:42:12|0:42:19|The cold prison life has just begun, and [Lion King] can only bear it alone.
0:42:30|0:42:40|The news of using children as subjects for drug experiments made his originally smiling eyes immediately turn dark, [Mouse] opened a Japanese restaurant in Japan, and he is currently bowing to see off the guests.
0:42:43|0:43:1|Betraying his brother, [Bill] is lying on the genuine leather sofa, staring at the two pieces of gold on the coffee table in deep thought. At this moment, Dr. Zhou in the refugee camp in Africa received a package containing a glass bottle with a seedling inside. She held it in her hand for a long time, and then planted it.
0:43:3|0:43:17|The commander who has experienced changes is sitting in front of the desk with his eyes closed, at this moment, in the prison, [Lion King] is calculating the dates with a soft ruler in his hand. In the Japanese restaurant, [Mouse] turns to look at the calendar on the wall, while outside the tavern, [Dan Ding] is handing over the management of his shop to someone else.
0:43:24|0:43:45|As time passed, the seedlings planted by Dr. Zhou had grown strong, and she looked at the vitality in front of her, with a hint of brightness in her eyes. At this moment, the prison door was opened, and [Lion King] walked out under the escort of the prison guard. Another rolling shutter door outside slowly rose, [Lion King] looked outside, his eyes somewhat uneasy.
0:43:46|0:44:0|He walked out, looked up, then glanced around. Outside the prison, it was eerily quiet, only the sound of the rolling shutter behind him could be heard. Then, with one hand holding his clothes, the other hand fumbling in his pocket.
0:44:0|0:44:5|Yu Guangzhong noticed a car parked in front of him, and saw [Dan Ding] getting out of the car, smiling at him.
0:44:7|0:44:17|[Lion King] looked at him, smiled and walked over. Although they didn't speak, the deep brotherly bond between them was already understood.
0:44:21|0:44:39|Walking through the bustling streets, [Dan Ding] led [Lion King] to a dilapidated house, and the two of them walked around to the front door. [Lion King] looked inside and fixed his gaze at the entrance. Inside the door, many ragged drifters were gathered in this small house. [Lion King] spoke to [Dan Ding].
0:44:44|0:44:56|[Lion King] and [Dan Ding] observed their surroundings as they walked towards the inside. Suddenly, they both stopped in their tracks and followed their gaze to see [Volcano] sitting there with a gray worn-out knitted hat on his head.
0:44:56|0:45:13|Disheveled hair and a stubble on his face seemed to be connected. [Volcano] felt someone watching him, he looked up and saw the two familiar figures. He scanned them up and down, confirming that the two people in front of him were real, tears welled up in his eyes.
0:45:13|0:45:32|He quickly turned his face away and picked up the iron box that had been prepared in advance, walking towards the other side. He took the shovel to give to his friend, then embraced goodbye, and then said goodbye one by one to the homeless man next to him. [Lion King] and [Dan Ding] waited silently behind him, then [Volcano] walked back and took the coat on the hanger.
0:45:32|0:45:52|Next to the old wardrobe, the densely drawn vertical lines with chalk appeared particularly prominent. As he took off his coat, he glanced at the cabinet door, then turned around, put on his clothes, and walked over. The camera gradually zoomed in on the cabinet door, making the vertical lines clearer and clearer, revealing the last sealed mark from yesterday.
0:45:52|0:46:4|[Volcano] walked up behind [Lion King], with his back facing him. [Lion King] turned around and asked. Without saying a word, [Volcano] turned around to meet [Lion King]'s gaze. The two stared at each other for a long time before [Volcano] spoke.
0:46:9|0:46:16|[Lion King] looked at [Volcano] in front of him, who now seemed like a completely different person. His chest heaved violently, whether out of anger or sadness, it was hard to tell.
0:46:40|0:46:45|A joke offset all the guilt, and the brothers set out on a new journey again.
0:46:54|0:47:9|The train heading to the destination crossed mountains and rivers, heading towards the distance. The three brothers arrived in Kumamoto, Japan. The tranquil mountains surrounded a small village, with houses of the same style scattered around. The three arrived at the sushi restaurant owned by [Mouse].
0:47:10|0:47:13|Mouse heard a noise and quickly stuck his head out of the small window to greet.
0:47:21|0:47:34|Later, he stepped forward and hugged him, [Lion King] held [Mouse]'s hand and pulled him in front of him, the two bumped shoulders. [Volcano] just nodded from afar, and [Mouse] nodded back at him.
0:47:49|0:47:58|[Volcano] lowered his head after hearing it, his eyes constantly avoiding. [Lulu] sighed and walked over, [Volcano] saw [Lulu] with open arms.
0:48:0|0:48:5|Holding back the tears in his eyes, he then hugged [Lulu] and asked.
0:48:10|0:48:25|Then he walked in and pushed open the other half of the door, where Sir Cao in a wheelchair was smiling at them. The smiles on Lion King and Volcano's faces suddenly disappeared, and Lion King turned to look at Dan Ding.
0:48:25|0:48:41|Subsequently, as they walked, [Sir Cao] took off the shoulder bag and smiled, raising one hand. [Lion King] bent down and tightly held it, then [Dan Ding] walked up and reached out his hand.
0:48:42|0:48:49|Sir Cao smiled and shook hands with Dan Ding, then he looked back and saw Volcano turning his head away, not daring to look at him.
0:48:54|0:49:0|The guilty [Volcano] tried hard to control his emotions as he walked up and knelt in front of [Sir Cao].
0:49:1|0:49:16|[Sir Cao] slapped [Volcano] hard across the face, causing the surrounding brothers to lower their heads with serious expressions. Then he dragged [Volcano] in front of himself and said, "..."
0:50:0|0:50:6|Volcano cried and threw himself into Sir Cao's arms, and Lulu couldn't help but shed tears when she saw this scene.
0:51:4|0:51:9|Volcano gave Lion King a meaningful look.
0:52:8|0:52:15|The [Old Man] tells everyone that the new wine festival will be held next week, and he wants to invite everyone to help with the ceremony.
0:52:31|0:52:48|After everyone agreed, [Sir Cao] made a gesture and spoke in Japanese with a smile. With rhythmic whistling, the village's sake ritual officially began, with the four brothers drumming on either side of the shrine and the villagers joyfully dancing.
0:53:25|0:53:31|In the eyes of the elderly in Japan, the importance of the details of brewing can be summed up in four words: a lifetime of mystery.
0:53:35|0:53:41|[Lion King] did not respond and changed the subject directly.
0:53:46|0:53:54|Sir Cao looked at him for a few seconds, then handed him the folding fan in his hand. [Lion King] took the fan and opened it, inside which the words "Choose Goodness" were written in a flowing script.
0:54:0|0:54:11|[Lion King] understands the reason behind this, which is the answer that Sir Cao gave to himself. He looks up at Sir Cao in front of him, and Sir Cao turns his head, responding to him with a determined look.
0:54:11|0:54:21|The scene returns to the wine offering ceremony, with [Lion King] laughing and drumming, while his brothers shout slogans beside him, enjoying the moment of revelry.
0:54:22|0:54:35|The sake ritual enters its final stage, with the elderly Japanese man using a large wooden hammer to directly open the sake barrel lid. Everyone fills their cups with sake and raises a toast to celebrate. After a long day of work, the brothers treat themselves by soaking in the hot springs.
0:54:55|0:55:7|Mouse accidentally mentioned Bill, and everyone stopped smiling and playing around. Volcano turned back with a serious face, leaned against a rock, and the atmosphere became awkward. Then Mouse spoke again.
0:56:1|0:56:15|That night in Budapest, [Volcano] felt that something was off with [Bill], so he followed him to the railing. [Bill] knew he couldn't hide anything from [Volcano]'s eyes, after much hesitation, he began to reveal his innermost secrets.
0:56:39|0:56:58|After everyone learned about [Bill]'s difficulties, there was silence for a long time. [Dan Ding] glanced at [Volcano] across from him, then looked to the side. At this moment, [Lion King] was rolling his eyes, lost in thought. He then swam over and said, "I remember the day I met with the intelligence officer."
0:57:11|0:57:21|[Dan Ding] spoke up, interrupting his thoughts.
0:57:40|0:58:4|[Lion King] finished speaking and looked at everyone. The brothers understood without saying a word and nodded silently. Two weeks later, everyone arrived at the car show. The magnificent city center square was bustling with people, and the venue was filled with uniquely designed cars in every corner. Beautiful car models posed and took photos on the side, and suddenly one of them walked over to promote the cars.
0:58:14|0:58:20|[Dan Ding] sat in the car observing the surroundings, while [Mouse] monitored the entrance of the venue in real time.
0:58:37|0:58:44|At this moment, a car stopped at the entrance of the venue, and the man in the passenger seat opened the rear door.
0:58:52|0:58:57|After [Mouse] finished speaking, [Lion King] identified the target and immediately started to act, quickly catching up with the man in front.
0:59:5|0:59:15|After [Lion King] finished speaking, he continued to follow. Unexpectedly, the man suddenly turned around. [Lion King] quickly moved away, pretending to gaze elsewhere. Facing the man, [Volcano] also picked up a flyer to demonstrate.
0:59:25|0:59:32|The two immediately stepped forward, and suddenly, the computer screen of [Mouse] was switched off.
0:59:39|0:59:45|At this moment, [Sir Cao] inside the house heard [Lulu]'s cry, he immediately took out his gun and hid it under the blanket covering his legs.
0:59:47|1:0:1|Outside the door, the man pretending to be [Bill] turned around. [Volcano] stood still, then the man quickly fired a shot. People ran for cover everywhere, and [Volcano] immediately ran to hide behind the iron plate. On the other side, [Lion King] ran and fired at the people chasing from behind.
1:0:1|1:0:16|Later, he fled into the venue. After [Volcano] dealt with the trouble in front of him and shot dead a man chasing [Lion King], he also exposed his own position. The brothers outside were enduring a hail of bullets, and at this moment, [Sir Cao] was also in danger.
1:0:16|1:0:34|He rolled his wheelchair out of the bedroom and into the hallway. Then, each bedroom door in front of him was slowly pushed open, with several men in black appearing on both sides of the hallway. The last bedroom door was pushed open, and [Lulu] was grabbed from behind and forcefully pushed out. Upon seeing this scene, [Sir Cao]'s eyes instantly turned fierce.
1:0:34|1:0:41|At the end of the corridor, [Bill] slowly walks out from inside, looking into [Sir Cao]'s eyes without any emotion.
1:0:41|1:0:56|At this moment in the venue, [Lion King] is still dodging around, his gun is out of bullets. In desperation, he throws the empty gun at the opponent, then forcefully knocks down the iron frame next to him. Immediately after, he quickly runs to the back of a racing car.
1:0:56|1:1:11|[Lion King] leaned against the car window for a moment, then leaped inside, but he was dumbfounded by the start-up device of this new luxury car. He randomly pressed some buttons, and the sports car actually started up. The people behind also quickly started another sports car to chase after.
1:1:11|1:1:18|Outside, [Volcano] is blocked by the opponent behind the iron plate and can't get out. At this moment, [Dan Ding] drives in.
1:1:25|1:1:33|[Lulu]'s phone call couldn't get through. [Dan Ding] reversed the car, breaking their decorative light bulbs in the process. He hurriedly chased after the enemy car ahead, only to be blocked by the dropped light bulbs.
1:1:36|1:1:44|At this moment, [Bill] bent down while [Sir Cao] raised his head and said expressionlessly.
1:2:26|1:2:36|[Sir Cao] slowly raised his head and stared at the insincere [Bill], then he spoke. [Bill] frowned and looked into [Sir Cao]'s eyes, then he stood up with a wry smile and said.
1:2:38|1:2:48|With the sound of intense impact, the decorative glass outside the venue splintered in all directions. At this moment, [Lion King] drove a sports car, burst through the wall from inside the venue, and the enemy car followed suit.
1:2:51|1:2:59|At this moment, several cars started to reverse one after another, with other vehicles on the road avoiding them. [Dan Ding] followed at the end, stepping on the gas pedal desperately chasing forward.
1:3:0|1:3:9|[Lion King] saw the enemy car behind getting closer, so he had to accelerate forward, while [Dan Ding] watched as [Lion King]'s car in front of him was getting farther and farther away.
1:3:16|1:3:30|On the other side, two sports cars were racing crazily on the road, the roaring sound of the engines echoing throughout the street, causing other vehicles to avoid them. Unfortunately, the driving force of [Lion King]'s car began to decline.
1:3:30|1:3:37|The enemy vehicle is about to approach the car. At this moment, [Bill] inside the house hears the words "surrender" and smiles bitterly.
1:4:20|1:4:27|It turns out that Ma Wen was killed by [Bill]. In order to avoid suspicion, he shot himself pretending to be injured.
1:4:53|1:5:5|Sir Cao's father raised his hand in anger to slap, but was stopped by [Bill]. At this moment, the Japanese old man suddenly ran in, [Bill] turned his head and looked back, his fierce eyes instantly softened. He let go of Sir Cao's father's hand and turned to the wheelchair.
1:5:5|1:5:11|Sir Cao did not answer, just stared at the old man in front of him without saying a word.
1:5:22|1:5:34|The old man finished speaking and pushed Sir Cao out of the house. [Bill] sneered as he watched the old man's back, while the men in black slowly closed the doors of each bedroom. Sir Cao sat heavily in his wheelchair.
1:5:34|1:5:44|At this moment, the door leading to the outside was also closed, leaving the two of them stranded in place. [Sir Cao] knew that the situation would not be easily resolved, so he spoke up.
1:5:46|1:6:3|[Bill] said nothing, just gestured from the side. The black-clothed man behind shouted loudly and raised his fist to charge forward. The Japanese old man lifted his leg, took a step back, and knocked the man down. Seeing this, the other black-clothed men in front did not dare to act rashly. Meanwhile, [Lion King] was still being chased frantically by someone.
1:6:3|1:6:7|[Dan Ding] is driving while looking for [Lion King].
1:6:8|1:6:18|Just now, [Dan Ding] drifted and blocked an enemy car behind him. The people behind were puzzled and tried to overtake, but [Dan Ding] immediately moved left and right to prevent the enemy from succeeding.
1:6:18|1:6:26|At this moment, [Lion King] swerved again from another intersection, with the enemy car beside showing no sign of backing off, and the vehicles following the turn were too scared to move.
1:6:26|1:6:38|At this moment, the roadside stall is still in business, and in the middle of the road, [Dan Ding] is still maneuvering with the car. Suddenly, he accelerates and turns the steering wheel to the right, causing the enemy car parallel to him to crash into the stall.
1:6:38|1:6:55|The items from the stall flew into the sky, making it hard to see clearly. They pushed forward and unexpectedly reached the end of the stall, which had a sloping iron frame. The car flew along the iron frame, hit a traffic light above, and then overturned on the ground. After dealing with the trouble, [Dan Ding] immediately rushed over following the route pointed out by [Mouse].
1:6:55|1:7:7|At this moment, [Lion King] encountered a big problem again. The road ahead was under construction, and the side road led straight to the shopping mall. With no other choice, [Lion King] honked the horn and drove towards the side road, causing pedestrians on the right to quickly move aside.
1:7:7|1:7:16|[Dan Ding] looked at [Lion King], driving a sports car straight through the entrance of the mall. He was about to step on the gas, but [Mouse] pointed out a new route.
1:7:18|1:7:30|At this moment, [Lion King] in the shopping mall is driving at the front, and the items on display inside are all knocked over. Suddenly, an umbrella pierces halfway through the car window. [Lion King] dodges to the side, then uses one hand to push the umbrella handle out.
1:7:31|1:7:38|In the next second, the car of [Lion King] crashed through the glass again and returned to the road, but a new problem arose.
1:7:39|1:7:54|After [Lion King] finished speaking, the sports car behind him slowly approached the side of his car, then rubbed against it and drove forward. In order to control the speed of [Lion King]'s car, the enemy occasionally hit the car body. [Lion King] sitting in the car had no resistance at all.
1:7:54|1:8:10|At this moment, another enemy vehicle also accelerated and caught up, directly hitting the rear of [Lion King]'s car, rubbing all the way to run parallel. Sparks flew outside the car, and [Lion King] tried to escape desperately, turning the steering wheel left and right, while the enemies squeezed towards the middle at the same time.
1:8:10|1:8:18|[Lion King], trapped between two cars, unable to move, glanced at the map and said.
1:8:27|1:8:45|The Lion King suddenly stopped, and the cars on both sides were all ejected and collided. At this moment, Dan Ding's car crashed into a building with broken glass, directly hitting the enemy car stacked together. The two cars, unable to react in time, were then crashed into the adjacent reception room. Finally, they rolled down the stairs.
1:8:45|1:8:53|After escaping the danger, [Lion King] drove forward and said, "Dan Ding" nodded at [Lion King] and immediately followed.
1:8:53|1:9:9|At this moment, the elderly Japanese man is fighting against the men in black. The martial arts skills of these opponents are no match for him. With a swift shoulder throw, he brings one of them down to the ground. As another person rushes towards him, the old man realizes his stamina is waning and reaches for the samurai sword on the cabinet.
1:9:9|1:9:30|Who would have expected that as soon as he grew taller, the bullet would pierce into his belly. Dad witnessed his good friend die in front of him, despairingly shouting the name of the old man. The old man responded to Dad Cao with a trembling voice, his hands gradually falling down. Behind him, [Bill] slowly put away the gun, and Dad Cao turned his wheelchair to question him.
1:10:3|1:10:18|[Bill] reached out to grab the blanket, only to find a hand holding a gun inside. His eyes immediately turned fierce, and the gun in his hand seemed ready to fire. [Sir Cao] pressed him with one hand and pulled out a gun with the other, pointing it at his chin. The sound of the gun echoed.
1:10:18|1:10:32|[Bill] looked shocked, and [Sir Cao] fell to the ground. At that moment, the bodyguard stood behind holding a gun, causing [Bill] to tremble as he stood up unsteadily. He took a few steps back, looking at [Sir Cao] on the ground, and then the hand holding the gun loosened.
1:10:32|1:10:50|Following that, he walked up to the security guard, eyes wide open, and [Bill] grabbed the bodyguard's collar and shouted loudly. At this moment, [Lulu] was being escorted in.
1:11:12|1:11:33|[Bill] looked at [Sir Cao] lying on the ground. The bodyguard walked past him and then turned to look at [Bill]. Seeing the boss getting angry, the people below silently left the scene. [Bill] stood still, his chest heaving, the blood splattered on his face making him look particularly fierce. Then, he looked at his father's body and slowly backed out of the room.
1:11:33|1:11:50|A few days ago, the lively Japanese restaurant is now as silent as death. [Sir Cao]'s body lies on the side with eyes wide open, tightly holding the gun in his hand, and the room is in a mess. At this moment, the sound of footsteps outside the Japanese restaurant can be heard, and the four brothers finally rush back.
1:11:56|1:12:17|Mouse knelt in front of Lion King, crying and holding his head. Volcano slowly lowered his head and knocked heavily on the floor. Lion King, upon seeing his father's body, leaned against the nearby cabinet, slowly sat down, tears uncontrollably streaming out. In a few days, it would be Sir Cao's funeral.
1:12:46|1:12:55|The four brothers, with devout hearts, revered the man who was willing to sacrifice himself for his brothers, and then they arrived at Sir Cao's memorial hall.
1:13:25|1:13:30|[Lion King] recalls a birthday celebration where everyone put the cake on his face while his father was making a wish.
1:13:57|1:14:5|The anger in his eyes seemed to surpass the sadness. After the sadness, the four of them walked out of the funeral parlor, with [Volcano] suppressing his anger and leading the way.
1:14:8|1:14:16|Mouse finished speaking, everyone stopped in their tracks and turned to look at him. Seeing the anger in everyone's eyes, Mouse took a deep breath and said, with Volcano glaring at him darkly.
1:14:24|1:14:38|The emotions of the group calmed down. After hearing this, [Volcano] glanced at [Lion King], then turned and walked out quickly, with [Dan Ding] following closely. [Lion King] did not stop them. Instead, he came over to comfort [Mouse], patting the tearful [Mouse].
1:14:40|1:14:57|They continued to move forward. At this moment, a map to Black Mountain appeared on the screen. In the pitch-black tunnel, a glimmer of light emerged as the four brothers drove their cars roaring past, following the winding mountain road towards their destination in perfect formation.
1:15:27|1:15:34|In the evening, everyone sat in the tavern drinking, [Dan Ding] picked up the bottle and clinked it.
1:15:36|1:15:53|After speaking, [Dan Ding] poured all the wine into another glass and placed it in the middle. The [Lion King]s picked up their glasses and clinked them with Dad's glass. After clinking glasses, the four of them raised their heads and drank it all in one go. Then they placed the glasses on the table. [Volcano] finished the drink, turned his head away, unwilling to look at the glass.
1:15:53|1:16:0|Sitting next to him, [Mouse] kept silent with his head down, while [Lion King] paused for a moment before continuing.
1:16:14|1:16:26|At this moment, no one was willing to answer the question, and everyone fell silent. A car pulled up in front of the tavern, and the [Lion King]s walked over.
1:16:28|1:16:32|The intelligence officer got out of the car and told [Lion King] that he had kept his promise and brought what [Lion King] wanted.
1:16:33|1:16:38|The opponent opened the trunk, and [Volcano] stepped forward to inspect. The trunk was filled with a large number of weapons and bullets.
1:16:49|1:16:57|As for how to deal with [Bill], it's up to the [Lion King]. After saying that, he reached out his hand to shake hands with the [Lion King], who just glanced at him.
1:17:5|1:17:9|The other party provided another piece of information about [Bill].
1:17:29|1:17:35|The atmosphere was eerily quiet at this moment, the operation was about to begin.
1:17:43|1:17:50|After speaking, [Dan Ding] immediately started the car. On the shore, [Mouse] and [Volcano] plunged into the water, and the attack plan began.
1:17:52|1:18:11|The soldiers on the island were startled by the sudden attack. [Bill] turned his head upon hearing the noise, and a cold light flashed in his dark eyes. By this time, the previously panicked soldiers had prepared to face the enemy. [Lion King] quickly stuck his head out and fired a shot towards the bridge, destroying the enemy's lookout tower directly.
1:18:11|1:18:23|At this moment, [Mouse] and [Volcano] successfully reached the shore. In front of them was a cliff about 10 meters high. The two of them took out rope guns and hooked onto the top stone, then quickly climbed up.
1:18:23|1:18:34|At this point, [Lion King] and [Dan Ding] were already driving deep into enemy territory. While [Dan Ding] was steering the wheel, he was also firing a machine gun, [Mouse] and [Volcano] sneaked into the outskirts of the house.
1:18:34|1:18:48|He agilely flipped over the railing and jumped down, before the enemies could react, he was killed by [Volcano] who broke his neck from behind. Then they killed the guards outside the control room and arrived at a hidden password-protected door, where [Mouse] took out the unlocking device and successfully entered.
1:18:48|1:19:3|At this moment, [Dan Ding] and [Lion King] are braving the gunfire to reach the final level, with the iron gate in front of them becoming the only obstacle to entering the interior of the island.
1:19:5|1:19:14|After speaking, [Mouse] pressed the switch, and the gate began to slowly descend. Someone unknown grabbed [Mouse] from behind, causing the gate to stop lowering.
1:19:15|1:19:25|[Dan Ding] was forced to stop in front of the gate, with the enemies slowly approaching from behind. At this moment, [Mouse] was struggling.
1:19:26|1:19:32|[Dan Ding] was puzzled, and at this moment the camera slowly pulled away.
1:19:33|1:19:46|Volcano's back appears, and after speaking, Volcano frowns, secretly pulls the trigger, and a bullet hits the enemy's forehead. Lion King takes advantage of the chaos and fires repeatedly backwards, pushing back the soldiers who were originally getting closer.
1:19:46|1:20:3|[Volcano] Another bullet successfully took down the gunner. The shell brought by [Volcano] actually fell into the water, causing huge waves. The enemies suddenly appeared next to [Volcano], he kicked the wall with his left leg, slid back to a safe position, then leaned out and shot them dead.
1:20:3|1:20:28|At this moment, while being flanked from behind, [Dan Ding]'s car was continuously shot at the rear. The gate dropped again, and [Dan Ding] immediately stepped on the gas pedal hard. However, the car behind was still crazily shooting at the car's tail. Just then, [Lion King] took out a bundle of hand grenades, opened the car door, and threw them towards the rear.
1:20:28|1:20:34|The enemy vehicle couldn't dodge in time, and was completely blown over, with the bridge also being blown apart in the middle.
1:20:39|1:20:51|[Lulu] stood up and shouted, but was pushed down by the person behind her. Sitting next to her, [Bill] gave her a cold look, then got up and walked to the monitor screen, watching the arrival of [Lion King] and others. His expression turned worried.
1:20:51|1:21:6|At this moment, [Lion King] and [Volcano] have entered the island, with their rifles forcing [Dan Ding] to retreat repeatedly. Then, [Lion King] kills a soldier, climbs up the arch wall, and subsequently moves outside to shoot a soldier hiding behind, blowing his head off.
1:21:6|1:21:17|With the rear threat resolved, [Dan Ding] immediately fled forward, with gunshots ringing behind. At this moment, [Lion King] leaped off the arch bridge and killed the man. Meanwhile, [Volcano] also encountered enemy encirclement.
1:21:18|1:21:28|The agile [Volcano] first shoots and kills the enemy, then rolls under the nearby stairs to operate the machine gun above. He then hides in the corner and calls for [Mouse].
1:21:30|1:21:40|[Mouse] answered [Volcano] while looking at the surveillance screen inside the house. At this moment, [Lulu] sat next to [Bill] without daring to move, with a gunman in black standing on both sides behind them.
1:21:50|1:22:7|[Bill] vented his anger towards [Lulu]. At this moment, [Lion King] and [Dan Ding] climbed to the roof to provide cover, then they hooked the rope onto the power line and slid across. The enemies were unaware of the danger. Just above, [Lion King] and the others slid along the power line while shooting, safely reaching the other side.
1:22:7|1:22:18|The cunning enemy threw a grenade, [Lion King] and [Dan Ding] immediately rolled outwards, they rolled and gathered to stand up and shoot. At this moment, [Lion King] locked eyes on the oil barrel across from him.
1:22:19|1:22:23|With a loud roar, a wave of scorching heat surged into the sky above the island, and flames bloomed brightly.
1:22:25|1:22:34|At this moment, [Dan Ding] backflips out of the glass door, with the destination right in front of them. [Lion King] and [Dan Ding] disregard everything and jump down from the building.
1:22:34|1:22:48|They broke through the roof and fell to the floor, both of them stood up despite the pain and ran towards the church. At this moment, [Bill] was standing in front of the monitor screen, it turned out that [Lion King] and their every move did not escape his eyes.
1:22:48|1:23:4|The driver who failed to assassinate the [Lion King] before is unexpectedly still alive, with a look of resentment in his eyes. As more enemies approach, the [Lion King] pulls out the explosive gun hidden behind his slingshot and shoots the opponent in the head.
1:23:5|1:23:16|Danny cooperated with Li Kai on the side, and [Lion King] immediately flipped over the wall next to him, jumped onto the wooden box in the air, and then lay down to kill the enemy above him. Due to the swinging force of the wooden box, [Lion King] fell to the ground.
1:23:17|1:23:23|The enemy below tried to shoot, but unexpectedly [Lion King] lying on the ground, shot along the opponent's knee.
1:23:23|1:23:39|[Dan Ding] was attacked by multiple people. Without noticing, he was shot in the shoulder. At this moment, the enemies in the aisle rushed towards [Volcano]. He quickly grabbed the enemy's hand and pinned him to the ground, then shot him against the temple. Meanwhile, [Mouse] behind him also eliminated the threat above.
1:23:40|1:23:49|The four brothers stopped preparing to shoot at the moment, with smiles on their faces. [Lion King] made a gesture, indicating that the four should act together.
1:23:51|1:24:6|Shortly after setting off, [Mouse] was shot in the leg by the enemy. [Volcano] immediately shot and killed the attacker, then helped [Mouse] to the iron cage. Meanwhile, [Lion King] was still engaged in combat with the enemy. At that moment, [Volcano] unlocked the lock on the iron gate.
1:24:8|1:24:16|[Dan Ding] immediately stepped forward and helped up the [Mouse] lying on the side. The [Lion King] quickly removed the hand grenade from the enemy's body, then crouched on the stone wall.
1:24:18|1:24:37|Stones kept rolling down, burying all the enemies below. At this moment, the door leading to the room was tightly shut, with numerous enemies lurking in every corner of the corridor. Inside the door, [Bill] stood in the middle with bodyguards, while gunmen positioned beside them all held their guns, staring intently at the door in front of them.
1:24:37|1:24:54|Everyone is holding their breath, waiting for the arrival of an intense battle. The corridor leading to the room is eerily quiet, and the [Lion King] and his team sense something is amiss. They hide on both sides of the corridor, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. [Dan Ding] loads his bullets,
1:24:54|1:25:0|Nodding to [Lion King], the opposite [Mouse] also nodded to [Volcano], and the four of them reached a consensus to start their operation.
1:25:1|1:25:18|[Volcano] took the lead and rushed out, the enemies lying in ambush immediately started shooting, bullets flying from all directions. He couldn't dodge in time and got hit twice. [Mouse] dragged his injured leg and kept shooting while charging forward, but got shot and fell to his knees, yet still didn't let go of his gun.
1:25:18|1:25:34|At this moment, [Dan Ding] knocked down the person about to shoot, ran over to help up [Mouse], and [Lion King] immediately rushed out to cover for his brothers. [Mouse], unable to move due to his injury, threw his own handgun to [Lion King]. After a short rest, they prepared to strike again.
1:25:34|1:25:52|Unexpectedly, the big door suddenly opened, and the driver rushed out with a gun, knocking down [Volcano] and [Dan Ding] who were covering on the side. [Lion King] aimed at the driver and fired continuously. Suddenly, a bullet grazed his face, leaving a blood mark on his face. [Lion King] was furious, the gun in his hand had reached its limit.
1:25:52|1:25:59|Opening it again, he quickly shielded the driver's body in front of him and finally fired a few shots at the rushing bodyguards.
1:25:59|1:26:12|At this moment, [Dan Ding] immediately rushed over and pinned the injured bodyguard to the ground. Unexpectedly, the bodyguard broke free from the restraint, threw a punch, but [Dan Ding] locked the bodyguard's hands with his feet, and together they brought him down before standing up and firing a gun.
1:26:12|1:26:28|Although the shot hit the driver's body, it completely enraged the [Lion King], who threw the body aside and charged forward roaring. Then, [Bill] hesitated to shoot. Everyone started shooting to warn him, which scared him back into the glass vault, too scared to come out.
1:26:37|1:26:50|Seeing [Lion King] with a fierce look outside the door, [Bill] trembled lips and his body involuntarily shook. He looked at the disappointed and resentful eyes outside the door and shouted.
1:27:48|1:27:59|[Bill] cried out, venting his grievances and anger. The face of [Volcano] still showed resentment, but his eyes turned red, and the angry eyes of [Lion King] gradually drooped down.
1:27:59|1:28:7|He lowered his head and paused for a moment, then silently turned around and walked towards [Volcano]. [Mouse] quietly took [Lulu] out.
1:28:35|1:28:51|Firing at the glass door together, bullets hit the glass door one by one with a crackling sound. [Bill] felt his legs go weak and involuntarily took a few steps back. The hard glass door cracked open, the gap getting larger and larger, as if the once strong brotherly bond was now shattered.
1:28:51|1:29:5|Threw a smoke bomb into the crack, [Bill] was choked and coughed repeatedly, took out his gun and ran out. He covered his mouth and nose with his arm, raised his gun ready to fight back. At this moment, everyone held up their guns and mercilessly fired bullets.
1:29:5|1:29:17|The glass door opened, and he fired again. This time, the four brothers dodged the bullets and each aimed at [Bill]'s limbs. Then he collapsed into the pile of gold behind him, staring straight at his brothers who were shooting.
1:29:17|1:29:34|[Lulu] cried when she saw this scene. At this moment, everyone walked forward, [Lion King] squatted down and pointed the gun at [Bill]'s head. On the side, [Volcano] widened his eyes. [Lion King] stared straight at [Bill] for a long time, then turned back to ask for his brothers' opinions.
1:29:34|1:29:47|Everyone shook their heads at him, but [Lion King] still didn't put down the gun. After some hesitation, it seemed like [Lion King] also started to feel afraid to face it, pointing the gun at himself, he turned his head, avoiding eye contact, and then spoke.
1:29:53|1:30:0|He then released the hand on [Bill]'s chin, slowly stood up, and [Mouse] cried out with a hint of tears.
1:30:3|1:30:22|After speaking, [Bill] frowned and looked at everyone. He looked desperate, as if he had fallen into a bottomless abyss, completely hopeless. Those words pierced deeply into his heart. The [Volcano] in front of him watched quietly, and he seemed to have caught hold of hope, reaching out and grabbing [Volcano]'s shoulder tightly.
1:30:36|1:30:58|[Volcano] shook off his hand and stood up to walk out. Tears in [Bill]'s eyes couldn't be stopped anymore, regretful tears rolled down his face. Suddenly, he saw a handgun dropped in between the gold coins, he picked up the gun tremblingly, stood up and pointed it at the backs of his brothers, then shouted loudly.
1:30:58|1:31:5|The crowd turned around immediately upon hearing the gunshot, only to see [Volcano] hitting [Bill] right in the chest, causing both of them to fall backwards.
1:31:20|1:31:40|[Bill] took a few steps back and fell to the ground, his feet spreading out as if relieved of a heavy burden, ultimately ending himself in this way, ending the cycle of mistakes, ending the brotherly bond of this lifetime. At this moment, everyone turned back nervously to look at [Bill], memories of the past flashing through their minds.
1:32:30|1:32:43|In front of the reporters, he continued to be asked about the source of the gold, he just said "no comment" and then turned and left. At this moment, Dr. Zhou [Doctor], who was in an African refugee camp, was drinking water from a cup.
1:32:43|1:32:51|As time passed, the seedlings on the table had bloomed into numerous bright flowers. Suddenly, the sound of a car starting outside could be heard.
1:32:53|1:33:11|She turned her head and found [Lion King] standing there. Dr. Zhou couldn't believe that the person she had been thinking about day and night was right in front of her. She was stunned for a while, unable to take her eyes off him. After realizing, she smiled at [Lion King]. [Lion King], standing far away, also smiled broadly.
