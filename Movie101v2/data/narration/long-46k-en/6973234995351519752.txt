0:2:57|0:3:8|The man, holding a cigarette, looked at the sky full of dragonflies outside the window with some confusion. He pinched off the cigarette butt at the corner of his mouth and replied to his daughter, [Elder Sister]. The girl glanced back at the man and was then attracted by the insects outside the window again.
0:3:8|0:3:19|A large dragonfly danced in the air, while the people on the ground below raised their heads to watch this strange scene. In this picture, the names of countless victims covered the entire scene.
0:3:19|0:3:47|As the intricate patterns formed by these people gradually become clear, the screen suddenly shows the ruins of Tangshan, with the title "Tangshan Earthquake" emerging. The scene shifts to a road, where a truck is slowly moving. The road is lined with lush greenery, people are riding bicycles, leisurely strolling on the shady sidewalks. School children who have just finished school are running and playing basketball, enjoying their leisure time after class.
0:3:47|0:3:59|Just off work, the workers were either riding or pushing their bicycles, chatting with their colleagues about family matters. Although it was summer, the sun was warm, the shade of the trees was refreshing, and the pedestrians were leisurely enjoying themselves.
0:4:2|0:4:14|Outside the factory gate on the other side, a small car drove out, followed by many workers riding bicycles. The camera then shifted to a pair of plain hollow sandals stepping on the bicycle pedals, appearing in the frame.
0:4:14|0:4:30|The woman in a floral dress with a collar floral shirt, carrying two new canvas bags around her waist, rode out of the factory on a bicycle. The front of the bike had a basket with pumpkins, beans, and some vegetables. The woman swiftly passed through the streets and disappeared at the alley entrance.
0:4:30|0:4:39|At the same time, the man drove a truck through the outskirts of the city, entering the bustling city, gradually slowing down to avoid the crowds at the intersection.
0:4:50|0:5:0|The truck drove slowly, with sunlight filtering through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the body. Through the front windshield, we see [Yuan Ni] and the little boy chatting happily.
0:5:18|0:5:26|The man took the two children out of the car, counted a few coins after finishing instructing them.
0:5:31|0:5:43|The two ice cream bars were not waiting for the man to finish speaking. The two children had already run to the ice cream stand and bought the ice cream bars. A slightly older boy next to them, shaking a shuttlecock, waited until the truck left and said,
0:5:44|0:5:53|Hearing his brother's shout, [Yuan Ni] quickly chased after him, putting away his diabolo and walking straight to the ice cream stand.
0:6:11|0:6:38|[Little Girl] protected her younger brother and watched as the crowd chased after them. She reminded her brother to run faster from time to time. The siblings turned into a residential compound. Just then, [Young Girl] caught up and grabbed the brother's hand, rushing into the building. They ran into their home where a woman was cooking. The [Young Girl] grabbed a fan and ran into the inner room.
0:6:48|0:6:53|Watching the little girl climbing onto the table to plug in the electricity, the woman hurriedly shouted at her to come down, turned on the fan, and looked at the siblings.
0:7:11|0:7:22|She is the mother of two children. After instructing the woman, she got up and walked out of the room. The siblings lay on the table, watching the rotating fan, enjoying the coolness and novelty.
0:7:22|0:7:52|Time flies, the distant sun is engulfed by thick clouds, struggling to scatter its light. Inside the house, two hands are sketching the pattern of a watch on a pair of small arms, with crooked and twisted lines that can hardly be called beautiful. Suddenly, the tip of the nose stings the arm, [Yuan Ni] turns around and asks him. The woman walks over and says,
0:8:34|0:8:55|The little boy chewed on a tomato. He is [Fang Da], the younger brother, while the girl, [Fang Deng], looked at him eagerly. As night fell, the man lowered the mosquito net, settled the siblings in bed, turned off the light, and quietly left the room. [Fang Da] was already fast asleep, while [Fang Deng] lay awake, watching their father leave with a worried expression on her young face.
0:8:55|0:9:10|It's late at night, she falls into a drowsy sleep, while outside the family building, the workers on the construction site are still busy. Even in the cool of the night, the summer heat lingers, causing many workers to go shirtless, enjoying the slight cool breeze.
0:9:54|0:10:17|The man pushed the woman towards the rear compartment and waited, then closed the door. He walked towards the back of the car and glanced around. The bright streetlights made him feel a bit guilty. When he reached the back of the car, the woman reached out and pulled him into the compartment, joking. The man closed the compartment's curtain, and the words almost whimpered from the woman's nostrils dispelled the man's unease in an instant.
0:10:18|0:10:26|He pinned the woman down in the carriage, greedily swallowing the fragrance on her body, watching the man on top of him eagerly, the woman laughed.
0:10:42|0:11:7|In the carriage, two people were on the verge of physical pleasure. Outside the family building, the collision of stone and iron heated up the summer night in the city. At the other end of the street, the bicycle bell at night was particularly crisp, as workers who had just finished work walked home together, chatting with neighbors who were cooling off by the roadside. Everything was as quiet and peaceful as usual.
0:11:7|0:11:27|In the family courtyard, it was quiet with most households already asleep, only a few scattered ones still had lights on. [Fang Da] and his sister had also fallen asleep, breathing evenly in their beds, while the goldfish in the jar on the table were tumbling in the water. Outside the window, there seemed to be a low, rumbling vibration.
0:11:28|0:11:48|As the roaring sound grew closer, the goldfishes twisted their bodies and jumped out of the fish tank one by one. The roaring sound became louder and louder, and in the distant area where the sky and the earth met, strange lights flickered. It seemed like the air in that area was distorted due to the vibrations. Before long, the entire ground began to shake violently. The woman in the train sensed something was wrong and asked,
0:11:50|0:12:14|Two people lifted the curtain and leaned out to look, only to see the three-story small western-style building opposite swaying. The slogan on its top was splashing sparks. At the same time, the siblings in the house were still fast asleep. The violent shaking tore the wall bricks, and dust fell like a waterfall, filling the entire room. The building swayed, and the green plants by the window were shaken down and fell to the ground.
0:12:14|0:12:37|The fan at the table next to him fell, startling [Fang Da]. He looked at the swaying light and widened his eyes. Outside the room, the asbestos tiles on the roof fell to the ground one by one. A man on the street jumped out of a truck and shielded a woman underneath him. After a while, he shouted to the woman, who then ran towards the family courtyard screaming.
0:12:39|0:13:8|In this chaotic home, [Fang Da] holds his younger brother in his arms, shouting loudly on the bed. Gradually calming down, [Fang Da] untangles the mosquito net wrapped around him, pulls his brother and tries to run outside. On the collapsing ground, a man protects a woman and rushes towards the family building without delay. Along the way, many people fleeing in haste are swallowed by huge cracks. The once lively lives suddenly become silent. The sturdy buildings, in front of the earthquake, seem as fragile as pieces of paper.
0:13:8|0:13:17|Effortlessly torn apart and overturned. Countless shattered bricks from the collapsed buildings rained down from the sky, leaving the escaping crowd with no way out, only able to dodge for their lives.
0:13:17|0:13:36|Several people escaped from the building but were hit by falling rocks, falling straight to the ground. The man looked up at the crane on the construction site and shouted loudly, pulling the woman while urgently avoiding the falling area. Before they could run a few steps, the thin steel bars on the crane emitted a chilling groan, and the couple ran for their lives.
0:13:36|0:13:45|The crane roared and crashed into a whole low-rise building, sending debris flying into the air like dust. The entire residential building was instantly filled with yellow sand, making it difficult for people nearby to see clearly.
0:13:45|0:14:9|Hearing the whistling of steel bars and bricks behind them, the man quickly pushed the woman to the ground. In the next second, there was a loud noise as the top of the crane directly fell at their feet. At this moment, the two were covered in dust, their clothes torn, and bloodied. They were in shock, turning around to see one after another residential building collapsing. Those who had just emerged from the yellow sand were swallowed by the dust in the blink of an eye.
0:14:9|0:14:20|In the room, the siblings stood by the table, swaying. [Fang Deng] staggered to the window, where a row of buildings across the street seemed to be held in the mouth of an invisible monster, and suddenly crumbled.
0:14:20|0:14:32|On the other side, the couple took care of each other. When they reached their own building, the house was already crumbling, leaning in a crooked manner. The man shouted and dragged the woman to the side, avoiding the falling attic. The next second, the attic crashed down beside them.
0:14:42|0:14:50|The woman also shouted and then pulled the man to run towards the entrance of the apartment building. The cracks on the wall became more and more dense and profound, and the shaking of the building became more intense.
0:14:50|0:15:14|In the room, the siblings were lying on the ground. The woman saw [Fang Deng] disappearing from the window and broke free from the man to run towards the apartment building. Ignoring others, the man used both hands to pull the woman back and threw her to the ground. The woman struggled to sit up, but when she turned around, she saw the man had already rushed into the falling bricks of the building. Immediately after, the tremors intensified, and terrifying cracks rapidly traversed the ground.
0:15:14|0:15:20|Relentlessly separating the woman from the apartment building, in that instant the building collapsed into pieces.
0:15:24|0:15:39|The woman lay prostrate on the violently shaking ground, struggling to prop herself up, shouting her husband's name towards the collapsed building. The man, called [Fang Daqiang], along with two children, were submerged in the rubble. The billowing smoke and dust swallowed the woman, and the scene gradually faded away.
0:15:39|0:16:1|After an unknown period of time, rain fell mercilessly on the ruins of Tangshan, as if a devastating earthquake was not enough. The pouring rain once again drenched all the refugees in their sorrow. In the midst of summer, everyone was dressed lightly, but now the cold raindrops hit their already scarred bodies, at the same time...
0:16:1|0:16:18|In the midst of capturing the pain of refugees losing their loved ones and homes, they wail like the walking dead on the ruins, with icy rain mixed with hot tears, delineating different hardships on their broken bodies like ink and brush strokes. The rainwater-soaked city ruins become muddy and difficult to navigate after being watered.
0:16:18|0:16:31|After the heart-wrenching tragedy, people still held onto hopes for life. Men with remaining strength rose up to rescue the survivors buried under the rubble, while the grieving women suppressed their sorrow and wholeheartedly cared for the wounded lying on the open ground with a breath of life still left.
0:16:31|0:16:42|In the ruins, scattered corpses can be seen everywhere, and the sky is filled with the mournful wails. The sun rises alone on the horizon, faintly illuminating the city through the clouds.
0:16:42|0:16:59|By the dim light, surviving refugees are flipping through the rubble with their bare hands, hoping that behind the next stone lies their loved ones. One stone after another, they deceive themselves with increasingly chaotic thoughts, unwilling to let go of their hopes.
0:16:59|0:17:18|Among the ruins, there were constantly fresh corpses being carried into the open space, where the tattered straw mats and cloth became temporary resting places for those souls. A ragged woman, with blood staining her bare feet, bent down to look into the eyes of her husband being carried out, a sight that tugged at the heartstrings.
0:17:59|0:18:8|The mother of the two children, shaken by the impact, buried Yuan Ni's hopes, she stood up and roared,
0:18:15|0:18:30|The roaring thunder of the storm drowned out the desperate screams of [Yuan Ni]. At the same time, under the heavy rubble, rain seeped through the cracks and soaked [Fang Deng]. She struggled to move but found herself powerless, trying to shout but only managing to cough incessantly.
0:19:2|0:19:21|The sky outside is starting to clear up, with dark clouds looming over the city. The whole Tangshan has turned into ruins, with only a few dilapidated buildings and streets outlined in the debris. Faintly visible is the original appearance of the city. [Yuan Ni] follows behind a few men, moving a body lying on a sheet to an open space. The body wrapped in the sheet is none other than [Fang Daqiang].
0:21:14|0:21:29|Outside the ruins, [Yuan Ni] and the others are working together to move the rubble. The siblings are getting weaker, with dried blood and mud on [Fang Da]'s body. He swallows saliva as his chest rises and falls slightly.
0:22:25|0:22:44|[Yuan Ni] knelt on the ruins, through the wreckage in front of her, she seemed to see the children below. After who knows how long, [Yuan Ni] was mentally scattered. Hearing the man next to her speaking, she was agitated and did not respond.
0:22:56|0:23:8|Uttering these words in a mumble, [Yuan Ni] squirms with her parched mouth, hot tears cutting through her dirty cheeks. She hoarsely calls out for her mother, darkness engulfing the sparkle in her eyes, as the stone slab continues to press down on her.
0:23:43|0:24:4|The scene shifts to a rural dirt road, where a transport plane is dropping supplies onto the empty ground. Military vehicles and troops stretch as far as the eye can see, moving urgently and orderly towards Tangshan City. Refugees support each other, struggling to move forward with difficulty. The shock that destroyed everything they loved still seems to reverberate in their minds.
0:24:5|0:24:13|In the crowd, [Yuan Ni], carrying her son on her back, stands out, while other refugees either have a sense of surviving a disaster or have lost everything.
0:24:13|0:24:34|In [Yuan Ni]'s eyes, all she could see was endless emptiness and darkness. She was covered in blood and dirt, her hair disheveled. [Fang Da] on her back was already unconscious, leaning against her shoulder with a head full of lime. His left arm hung weakly, swollen like a piece of lotus root. [Yuan Ni] staggered along, moving forward slowly with the massive crowd of refugees.
0:24:34|0:24:49|Passing by the station where the People's Liberation Army was distributing food, she remained unmoved, walking through the refugees who were almost fighting for pancakes and swallowing them greedily. [Yuan Ni] continued to stagger, her weakness and disorientation catching the attention of two PLA soldiers.
0:24:49|0:24:57|The soldier caught up with [Yuan Ni], supporting her and the child on her back. With the support of [Yuan Ni], she completely collapsed at that moment.
0:24:58|0:25:20|In the ruins of the city on the other side, heavy rain poured down once again. The rescue team had arrived, and several tractors for transporting bodies were parked on the open ground. The buckets of the vehicles were already filled with the bodies of the victims. The heavy rain drenched everything, and blood seeped out from the seams of the vehicles. The rain poured down on the muddy ground, also falling on the [Fang Deng] and the broken bodies of numerous victims.
0:25:20|0:25:33|The cold rain pierced through the thin clothes of [Fang Deng]. The little girl woke up, her chest heaving rapidly, she tilted her head and slumped in the muddy ground, [Fang Deng] looked around with great effort.
0:25:33|0:26:0|At first glance, she saw the glistening raindrops in the air. At the second glance, she saw her father's corpse beside her. Struggling to get up, she looked around and saw the ruins, the mountains of corpses, and the misty rain. [Fang Deng] twisted her frail body, looking around, completely different from before. Her right eye was swollen, filled with abandoned pain, while her left eye was clear, cleansing the wounds in sight.
0:26:0|0:26:12|[Fang Da] The tender skin was covered with horrifying wounds and bloodstains. She walked barefoot on the cold and muddy ground outside the residential compound, looking around, but couldn't recognize the once familiar streets.
0:26:12|0:26:35|She looked blankly at the people coming and going around her, hoping that the next person passing by would be her mother. The rain curtain was as cold as ice, covering [Fang Da]'s almost naked body, soaking the tattered clothes, sticking to the skin full of wounds. In the bitter wind and rain, she stood in the crowd, shivering with cold, her body trembling uncontrollably.
0:26:36|0:26:42|The PLA soldier hurried forward,
0:26:50|0:27:12|His words struck a chord in [Fang Da]'s fragile heart, and in just a moment, tears welled up in his eyes. Looking at the pitiful little girl in front of him, the soldier was deeply moved. He wrapped [Fang Da] tightly in his raincoat, carrying her towards the resettlement point. In the soldier's arms, [Fang Da] couldn't help but turn her head to take one last look at the land where she had lived, before the scene gradually faded away.
0:27:15|0:27:29|After a while, the scene shifts to a temporary tent community set up for refugees. The military cultural troupe in the army is organizing refugees and disaster relief soldiers to watch a movie. The military tents almost cover the entire open space, with everyone surrounded in the middle.
0:27:29|0:27:48|At the far end of the screen sit the solemn People's Liberation Army soldiers, with earthquake orphans placed on the benches in front of them. Refugees lean on each other on the long bench in the front, as the warm and resonant singing in the movie slowly comes in, comforting the hardships in the refugees' hearts and dispelling the fatigue in the minds and bodies of the disaster relief soldiers.
0:27:48|0:28:8|On the side of the screen, inside a tent, a couple of soldiers, accompanied by staff, gaze earnestly through a small window at the group of orphans left behind after the earthquake. Behind the couple, a female soldier with double twisted braids says to them,
0:28:27|0:28:34|The male soldier squatted down, his eyes fixed on [Fang Da] in the crowd.
0:29:20|0:29:24|Adorable as can be, the male soldier captures this scene and decides to adopt [Fang Da].
0:29:27|0:29:50|The scene shifts to the road, with clear weather and military trucks lined up under the shade of trees. They are carrying relief soldiers and driving back and forth to the base. As they approach the base, the lively sound of gongs and drums can be heard from afar. The vehicles start to slow down, heading towards the gate of the base. On one of the trucks, [Fang Deng] is being protected by a military couple.
0:29:56|0:30:8|The base held a lively welcome ceremony, with the soldiers lining the way to welcome back the returning soldiers. They looked spirited and confident, while the soldiers on the vehicle stood tall and performed military salutes. [Fang Deng] leaned against the railing, with a look of confusion and unease on his face.
0:30:13|0:30:19|The female soldier gave [Fang Deng] a new name, calling her Yaya.
0:30:29|0:30:50|The male soldier carefully placed [Fang Deng] on his wife's back, saying that the woman suppressed the chaotic breath, hypocritically saying that she was not tired. Joyfully carrying [Fang Deng] to the bottom of the building, the male soldier then opened the door and said to [Fang Deng],
0:30:54|0:31:3|The female soldier, unable to contain her inner joy, still smiled happily as she carried [Fang Deng] through the corridor, lifted the bead curtain, and only reluctantly placed her on the floor after entering the bedroom.
0:31:3|0:31:23|[Fang Deng] turned his head to look around the spacious and tidy room, filled with awards of the couple. The male soldier is named Wang Deqing, and the wife is named Dong Guilan. [Fang Deng] looked around curiously for a while, then his gaze stopped at the ceiling light. Dong Guilan also looked up, then squatted down and said with concern,
0:31:25|0:31:33|Pulling back the bead curtain, the three of them entered the room of [Fang Deng] and his wife, which they had prepared for a long time. Dong Guilan spoke first, saying,
0:31:41|0:31:56|Dong Guilan's smile froze on her face as she saw [Fang Deng] staring at her coldly. Let's take a bath and change into clean clothes. She awkwardly changed the subject and sat [Fang Deng] on the bed.
0:31:56|0:32:4|Yuan Ni then walked to the side of Wang Deqing at the door of the room, and the two of them whispered to each other. They pushed aside the bead curtain and walked out.
0:32:29|0:32:53|On the other side, amidst the smoke and dust raised by the passing tractor, [Yuan Ni] brought [Fang Da], who had lost his left arm, back to Tangshan. Both of them were dressed in coarse work clothes and cloth shoes. [Yuan Ni] led [Fang Da] into the ruins. [Yuan Ni] looked much thinner than before, with a hint of unknown emotions in her eyes. With the help of the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the city had begun to rebuild. The streets were crowded with people, and there was a hint of the former liveliness.
0:32:53|0:33:14|In the depths of the city, the remaining dangerous buildings and piles of bricks serve as constant reminders of the recent hardships. [Yuan Ni] walks with [Fang Deng] among the crowd, and two familiar figures appear before them, Fang Daqiang's mother and sister have arrived in Tangshan.
0:33:30|0:33:47|[Yuan Ni] hurried to open the door, while [Grandma] squatted on the ground holding [Fang Da], tears streaming down her face in an instant. That night, the four of them squeezed into the cramped resettlement room, with [Fang Da] in [Grandma]'s arms already fast asleep.
0:34:0|0:34:6|[Elder Sister] packed up her luggage and sat on the bed, looking at [Grandma] and [Yuan Ni] with a complex expression.
0:34:13|0:34:20|[Grandma] looked a bit uneasy, she lowered her head and held her grandson in her arms, changed her words and continued to persuade [Yuan Ni].
0:34:31|0:34:40|[Grandma] was persuading, but her words were full of deep emotions, causing a moment of silence among the three. [Yuan Ni] didn't catch the meaning behind the old lady's words.
0:34:49|0:34:57|Seeing the mother getting a bit anxious, [Elder Sister] on the side quickly stepped in and said,
0:35:20|0:35:28|Avoiding the eager gazes of [Grandma] and [Elder Sister], [Yuan Ni] said,
0:36:33|0:36:40|[Grandma] finally let out her grievances and cried, venting towards [Yuan Ni] who was timid and fearful on the opposite side.
0:37:7|0:37:20|[Yuan Ni] sobbed, wiping her tears fiercely with her sleeve. Across from her, [Grandma] and [Elder Sister] were also deeply emotional, immersed in pain. The three of them remained silent, [Yuan Ni] gazed at [Fang Da] sleeping in [Grandma]'s arms, and finally spoke,
0:37:22|0:37:41|Grandma and Elder Sister looked over, but Yuan Ni's gaze was fixed on her son. She seemed to have used all her strength to squeeze out these few words. Grandma's eyes turned red, and Elder Sister wiped away the tears on her cheeks, softly saying,
0:37:59|0:38:12|[Yuan Ni] remained silent, her eyes fixed on [Fang Da] in Grandma's arms. Elder Sister twisted her body, searching in her pockets, then turned to [Yuan Ni] and said,
0:38:16|0:38:41|Elder Sister leaned forward and handed the photo to [Yuan Ni]. The dim figures of a family of four in the black and white photo once again stirred the deep pain in [Yuan Ni]'s heart. She tightly gripped the edge of the photo with one hand, while the other hand hurriedly covered her mouth, holding back the sorrow that was about to burst out, sending it into her nostrils, stimulating her tear glands. Tears formed into crystal clear beads, seeping into the crevices of her fingers.
0:38:41|0:38:48|On this night, above the immersed ruins, a family opens up their wounds, different individuals experiencing the same pain.
0:38:48|0:39:16|The next day, three people took [Fang Da] on a tractor. [Yuan Ni] appeared extremely fragile, and with the help of Elder Sister, she barely managed to get on the vehicle. She held her son in her arms and hugged him tightly, only letting go of one arm to stabilize herself when the vehicle started moving. The tractor swayed towards the outskirts of the city, with [Yuan Ni] holding [Fang Da] in the vehicle without saying a word, she perhaps
0:39:16|0:39:33|Blaming herself, wondering why she agreed to send her son away last night, or perhaps simply savoring the final moments with her son, they traveled in silence to the bus stop heading to Jinan. Seeing the bus approaching, [Yuan Ni] turned to [Fang Da] on her back and reminded him,
0:39:54|0:40:12|Following the train all the way to the end of the carriage, standing on tiptoe and looking through the window at the moving vehicles, watching [Fang Da] waving goodbye from the window getting further and further away, [Yuan Ni] stood still as if her soul had been taken away.
0:40:17|0:40:31|In the carriage, Elder Sister expressed a hint of pity and complaint to Grandma. Grandma, after listening, glanced slightly at Yuan Ni, who was still leaning and watching the car drive away. Her detached soul seemed to be carried forward by the slowly moving vehicle, getting farther and farther away from Yuan Ni.
0:40:32|0:41:7|At this moment, the car stopped, the door opened, and amidst the faint smoke and dust raised by the yellow sand, Elder Sister helped [Fang Da] out of the car. Yuan Ni frowned but still couldn't see clearly the two figures. She suppressed her excitement, trembling with anticipation as she hoped for Yuan Ni to quicken her pace towards Fang Da. The one-armed son also staggered towards his mother, calling out "mom" with tears streaming down his face. The mother and son embraced tightly on the dirt road, their calls echoing through the surroundings, spreading across this land.
0:41:7|0:41:23|In the car, Elder Sister shifted her gaze from the window to Grandma. Seeing Yuan Ni's wish fulfilled, she looked a bit lost at the moment. Elder Sister quickly leaned forward and gently touched the old woman's shoulder. In silence, the two of them left Tangshan as the car drove away.
0:41:23|0:41:29|[Yuan Ni] knelt on the ground, not even glancing at the departing car, her eyes filled with the slender figure of [Fang Da].
0:41:30|0:41:41|In the canteen on the other side of the camp, Wang Deqing and his wife took [Fang Deng] to get food. The three of them carried their meals and walked towards the table. A young female soldier asked,
0:42:6|0:42:14|Dong Guilan replied when Fang Deng remained silent,
0:42:25|0:42:52|Wang Deqing helped [Fang Deng] out of trouble, and then the family of three started eating. Back at home, Dong Guilan changed [Fang Deng]'s clothes and was combing her hair. Two small twisted braids were tied with pretty rubber bands on her head. Dong Guilan joyfully held up a mirror to show [Fang Deng], smiling and asking. [Fang Deng] nodded obediently, and when she heard Wang Deqing's voice outside the door, Dong Guilan put down the mirror, on [Fang Deng]'s round face.
0:42:52|0:43:19|After kissing, under a banner welcoming new students, a family of three arrived at the school registration desk. [Fang Deng] stood with his arms on the table, while behind him, Mr. and Mrs. Wang looked kindly at him. The teacher in charge of registration was also attracted by the adorable [Fang Deng], saying, [Fang Deng] blinked cutely, and the teacher continued to ask questions. The little girl with an accent gave a different answer.
0:43:19|0:43:29|Dong Guilan and the teacher were a bit surprised. Wang Deqing looked at his wife and said, "Fang Deng is sitting next to the flower bed at school, leaning against Wang Deqing."
0:43:55|0:44:2|Wang Deng smiled for the first time and said that the couple took [Fang Deng] away from the school.
0:44:5|0:44:17|The scene shifts to Tiananmen Square in September 1976. Just two months after the Tangshan earthquake, when most people had not fully recovered from the shock, a superstar fell and the nation mourned.
0:44:17|0:44:30|On September 9, 1976, Chairman Mao Zedong passed away in Zhongnanhai. The whole country mourned, and countless people with sorrow and admiration gathered in Tiananmen Square to mourn the departure of the great leader.
0:44:30|0:44:48|In the military camp, soldiers wept with red eyes, mourning for themselves, for their comrades, and for the children who were still unaware of the situation. They pinned white mourning flowers on their chests, conveying their sorrow and remembrance in every person's eyes, intertwined with every inch of the mountains and rivers. The auditorium was surrounded by wreaths and elegiac couplets.
0:44:48|0:44:55|Warriors lined up in neat and solemn columns, coming to the auditorium in batches to observe a moment of silence for Chairman Mao Zedong.
0:44:55|0:45:12|In the foreground, a portrait of Chairman Mao is solemnly hung in the center, with a curtain of delicate flowers hanging on the frame, and tall pine and cypress trees standing beside the frame. Six soldiers wear filial piety flowers on their chests, with armbands tied to their sleeves, solemnly guarding around the portrait.
0:45:15|0:45:35|The sound of three gongs echoed in the camp, and all the soldiers on the square bowed their heads in silence. At this moment, their memories of Chairman Mao merged into the majestic funeral music. They hoped that the resounding melody could carry their own grief, the thoughts of the whole nation, and endure in the world forever.
0:45:35|0:45:39|The scene fades away in the solemn crowd of mourners.
0:45:45|0:46:10|Time flies, and ten years later, in 1986, on the ruins of Tangshan, a new city has risen with dense buildings and lush greenery. After a decade of reconstruction and development, Tangshan has regained its former vitality. Just like ten years ago, [Yuan Ni] is riding her bicycle home. She is dressed in coarse cloth clothes, wearing a pair of cloth shoes, with her hair messily tied up at the back of her head.
0:46:14|0:46:26|Wiping the naked upper body of [Fang Da] with a towel, he had a strong muscular body, except for the missing arm. He walked into the house with breakfast, took off his T-shirt and returned to the room. [Yuan Ni] said while tidying up the house.
0:46:46|0:46:59|[Yuan Ni] stopped arguing with her son and moved to the memorial of her husband and daughter, lighting incense. She then walked into [Fang Da]'s bedroom, placed a potted plant on the table, and struggled to move the refrigerator next to it.
0:47:13|0:47:21|[Fang Da] lifted his lonely arm, moved the chair blocking the way, and leaned on the refrigerator.
0:48:23|0:48:30|The scene cuts to the textile factory where [Yuan Ni] works. A female worker shouts into the phone before entering the noisy workshop.
0:48:37|0:48:59|[Yuan Ni] looked at the unfinished work behind her, sighed, and outside, the rain was starting to fall. At the station entrance, [Fang Da] was wearing a raincoat and holding a sign advertising a hotel, waiting. A few colleagues were leisurely playing pool around him. When they heard the news of a guest coming out of the station, they hurried over. [Fang Da] ran to the front and asked the just-arrived traveler.
0:49:6|0:49:16|The rain was getting heavier, [Yuan Ni] put on a raincoat and rode her bike awkwardly across the railway crossing. By the time she arrived at [Fang Da]'s school, she was already soaked from head to toe.
0:49:16|0:49:28|[Yuan Ni], ignoring the cotton pants on her body, took off her raincoat and hurriedly ran to the door of the teacher's office. After confirming the location accurately, she bent down and knocked on the wooden door to come in.
0:49:33|0:49:40|[Yuan Ni] didn't dare to go in, gently called out to Teacher Jiang who was correcting assignments without turning his head.
0:49:52|0:50:2|When Teacher Jiang turned around, she went in and explained with a grievance. That night, [Yuan Ni] led [Fang Da] to burn the paper money, and the flames rose slowly with faint smoke.
0:51:28|0:51:45|Upon hearing her son's words, [Yuan Ni] slapped [Fang Da] in the face, igniting a spark of anger between them. Both fell silent. Under the cover of night, Tangshan city was enveloped in silence, as if time had come to a standstill in this city. Countless flames burned on the streets, casting a thick veil of sorrow over the land.
0:51:45|0:51:56|The scene shifts to the street, where a figure stands tall and graceful, the girl seems to be enveloped in a thin layer of strange radiance, appearing out of place on this street.
0:51:56|0:52:9|Ethereal music plays as Yuan Ni sees Fang Daqiang and his family on bicycles in front of her. She waves and calls out, but they ignore her and continue on their way.
0:52:9|0:52:28|The bicycle whizzed past [Fang Deng], the family was harmonious and joyful, smiles all around. [Fang Deng] looked on in surprise as the family moved further away from her. Standing by the roadside, she gazed fixedly at the departing trio, leaving [Fang Deng] alone on the desolate street.
0:52:30|0:53:10|In the bedroom, [Fang Deng] heard a scream, [Fang Daqiang] and her husband woke up and hurried to the next room. [Fang Daqiang] entered the room, turned on the table lamp, [Lao Niu] was sitting beside gently stroking her daughter's body, saying [Lao Niu] picked up the cup on the table and walked out of the bedroom. [Fang Daqiang] looked at [Fang Deng] with tears on her face, he carefully placed [Fang Deng] on his lap, and the girl also leaned on her father's chest.
0:53:10|0:53:18|[Wang Deqing] skillfully supported his daughter's head, gently massaging it with his index finger, [Fang Deng] nodded.
0:53:40|0:53:48|[Dong Guilan] lifted the water and opened the bead curtain to enter the bedroom. She looked at her daughter lying on [Wang Deqing] in shorts, her face looking somewhat unnatural.
0:54:0|0:54:6|Wang Deqing didn't return until his daughter fell asleep. Dong Guilan sat by the bed with a desk lamp on, looking at her husband and said,
0:54:8|0:54:14|Closing the door, [Fang Deng] heard his wife's blame, turned around and looked at her in confusion, then walked to the bedside to comfort her.
0:54:32|0:54:38|[Wang Deqing] stood in front of his wife, took a deep breath, and said,
0:56:14|0:56:26|After Wang Deng rode away on his bicycle, Wang Deqing watched his daughter leave and sat side by side with Dong Guilan on a bench in the park.
0:56:39|0:56:44|For years, [Dong Guilan] has always been wary of her daughter going out, her deep love for [Wang Deng] causing her to be so anxious.
0:57:8|0:57:29|Wang Deqing poured water in the inner room and said, while Dong Guilan turned her head disapprovingly to look at Wang Deqing, about to say something. The daughter sensibly spoke, and Wang Deqing nodded in response. He seemed to sense that Fang Deng had concerns and didn't say much more.
0:57:40|0:57:48|On the other side, [Fang Da] is carrying luggage, ready to go out and seek his fortune.
0:58:3|0:58:28|[Yuan Ni] couldn't stop him, so she had to send her son out. [Yuan Ni] avoided her son, waved her hand, walked into the courtyard and closed the iron gate. She leaned against the door, quietly listening to the sound of her son outside. [Fang Da] walked to his friend, who nodded awkwardly, threw away the cigarette in his hand. [Fang Da] and a group of six people hurriedly left with their luggage.
0:58:29|0:58:51|[Yuan Ni] rested her forehead on the iron plate, the weak morning sunlight unable to clearly illuminate her reluctance and worry. She listened to the sound of [Fang Da] complaining to his friends outside the door, and the rustling of a group of people leaving, until it was completely quiet outside. [Yuan Ni] still didn't have the strength to move. Outside, [Fang Da] and his group walked quickly towards the dawn, while on the other side...
0:58:51|0:59:8|Wang Deng, dressed in a plain checkered shirt and dark nine-point skirt, with two twisted braids, carrying luggage in both hands and a bed mat and straw mat tied to her back, walked laboriously up the steps to the reporting office. She successfully enrolled in Hangzhou Medical College, leaving the home that she found hard to let go of.
0:59:8|0:59:19|Entering the report office, a senior brother approached and asked, [Fang Deng] thanked him, put down his luggage, took out the admission letter and handed it to the teacher.
0:59:46|1:0:5|The teacher ignored Fang Deng's question, and the boy happened to take the luggage from her hand and walked out. Fang Deng felt embarrassed to ask again, so she had to endure the discomfort and followed the boy. As the welcoming announcement for new students played over the speakers, the two walked through the campus on a hot summer day, carrying their luggage up a gentle slope. The boy stopped and turned to Fang Deng, chin up, and said,
1:0:7|1:0:26|[Fang Deng] followed his gaze towards the toilet, then turned back to look at this attentive young man. He ran towards the toilet upon hearing the young man shout. Realizing that he still had a mattress tied to his back, [Fang Deng] ran back and stuffed the luggage into the young man's arms before hastily leaving after a simple thank you.
1:0:26|1:0:34|On the other side of Tangshan Street, after [Fang Da] left, next to an appliance repair shop, [Yuan Ni] opened a tailor shop.
1:1:28|1:1:40|The scene shifts to Hangzhou Railway Station. Despite it being summer, the square is still crowded. [Wang Deqing] is carrying luggage and wearing military uniform as he walks out of the hall, coincidentally encountering [Fang Da] who is soliciting business.
1:2:27|1:2:51|Not long after, the scene shifts to Hangzhou Medical College, surrounded by dense forests, appearing very quiet. Despite the scorching sun, the campus ground is wet. [Wang Deqing] still feels uncomfortably hot. He asks a passing student for directions and locates his daughter's dormitory building. Arriving at the door, he sets down his luggage and knocks.
1:2:52|1:3:24|In the dormitory, there was no sound. He gasped and continued to knock on the wooden door. After a while, when [Wang Deqing] thought he had the wrong place, [Wang Deng] opened the door and looked at his father outside with surprise. The reunion was joyful. [Wang Deqing] did not notice the loose button on his daughter's collar. He picked up his luggage and walked into the dormitory, only to find a male student standing by the bed, hastily putting on a watch.
1:3:54|1:4:13|After speaking, Yuan Ni realized that Fang Da, who was wearing military uniform, was staring at her without anger. The boy, avoiding eye contact, picked up the wallet on the table and left as if escaping. Fang Daqiang glanced at his daughter, then followed the boy and closed the dormitory door behind him.
1:4:38|1:4:50|Hearing this, Wang Deqing, who was taking snacks out of the trunk, paused for a moment and said, while Wang Deng stopped twisting the towel, stood still, and took a while before responding.
1:5:6|1:5:19|Taking the towel, [Wang Dejin] looked at his daughter with a worried expression. He gave a bitter smile, lowered his head, his facial muscles twitching, and remained silent. Faced with his daughter's questioning, [Wang Dejin] frowned slightly in pain.
1:5:19|1:5:46|He wiped his serious face with a towel and said, "[Fang Deng] had never seen his father like this before. In an instant, she realized the seriousness of the situation." Mr. Niu from the Tangshan Street Electrical Appliance Repair Shop saw off the customers, took a few magazines, and walked out. He arrived at the neighboring tailor shop and watched [Yuan Ni] busy in front of the sewing machine. He walked in slowly.
1:5:51|1:5:58|Putting down the magazine, [Master Niu] noticed that the light above [Yuan Ni]'s head was out. He then walked over to check, feeling around and saying,
1:6:4|1:6:15|[Master Niu] held the newly lit light tube in his hand and froze. He tentatively asked, and [Yuan Ni] responded quietly, looking up at him with glasses on.
1:6:26|1:6:42|Upon hearing these words, [Yuan Ni] looked up at herself, and [Master Niu] realized that his previous words were a bit too straightforward. He awkwardly closed his mouth, left the tailor shop, and noticed [Master Niu]'s attentiveness towards him. [Yuan Ni] subtly avoided his intentions, sewing on the sewing machine while thinking of a plan.
1:6:42|1:7:3|Early the next morning, [Yuan Ni] rode her bicycle through the crowd at the morning market and stopped in front of the tailor shop. She parked her bike and didn't rush to open the door. Instead, she carried a bulging cloth bag of gifts and walked to the door of the neighboring repair shop. Master [Lao Niu], who was concentrating on welding circuit boards, saw [Yuan Ni] standing at the door and quickly took off his goggles. [Yuan Ni] spoke up,
1:7:5|1:7:22|In the afternoon, the two of them quickly closed the shop and [Yuan Ni] led [Lao Niu] to her own doorstep. Opening the courtyard gate, [Yuan Ni] walked ahead while [Lao Niu] followed with his bicycle. They entered the inner room and arrived at the landline telephone. [Yuan Ni] turned to look at [Lao Niu] behind her, picked up the receiver and said,
1:7:24|1:7:48|Master Niu threw the bag he was carrying on the side table, walked over to take the microphone from Yuan Ni, put it to his ear to listen, confirmed there was no sound, then he put down the microphone, turned the base of the landline phone over, opened the battery compartment, took out a screwdriver from his chest pocket, unscrewed the two batteries inside, took two new batteries from his pocket and put them back in, sealed the compartment, and then turned the base back over to place it properly.
1:7:48|1:8:7|After Master Niu replaced the battery, the landline display lit up, indicating that it had been fixed. Without even confirming, he handed the handset directly to Yuan Ni next to him, put away the screwdriver, and sat back on the sofa, fanning himself with a palm-leaf fan, saying,
1:8:15|1:8:28|Master Niu fanned himself while surveying the furnishings of the room, his gaze falling on the memorial photos of Fang Daqiang and Fang Deng. In the evening, a table was set up in the courtyard, where Yuan Ni and Master Niu sat facing each other.
1:9:7|1:9:12|[Master Niu] let out a long sigh, then picked up the white wine on the table and filled the empty glass in front of [Yuan Ni].
1:9:16|1:9:34|After a few sips of yellow soup, [Master Niu] became more bold, not avoiding it after a sigh, clearly asking [Yuan Ni], then took a sip of the wine in the cup.
1:9:46|1:9:58|Following his lead, [Yuan Ni] raised her head and finished the wine in the cup, then picked up the chopsticks to taste a few bites of food, suppressing the spiciness in her stomach. At this moment, [Master Niu] grabbed [Yuan Ni]'s hand holding the chopsticks.
1:10:3|1:10:18|Yuan Ni did not resist much. Master Niu took the opportunity to pour wine and walked to her side. His hand naturally rested on Yuan Ni's shoulder. Feeling the frivolous hand behind her, Yuan Ni remained expressionless.
1:10:22|1:10:38|[Master Niu] looked at the cold-faced [Yuan Ni], awkwardly frozen in place. With extreme embarrassment, as the dinner came to an end, [Master Niu] picked up his bag and said to [Yuan Ni],
1:10:42|1:10:48|Leading the depressed [Lao Niu] to the courtyard gate, [Yuan Ni] opened the iron gate, only to hear [Lao Niu] say,
1:10:54|1:11:18|[Master Niu] looked at her deeply, then lowered his head and walked out of the courtyard. Without waiting for [Master Niu] to go far, [Yuan Ni] mercilessly closed the gate. On the other side, in the stationed hospital, [Wang Deqing] walked out of the ward and answered a call from the director. Inside the glass window, the daughter was taking care of the critically ill [Dong Guilan].
1:12:15|1:12:31|She looked up at the ceiling without any expression, took a deep breath, and said slowly. Pausing for a moment, she squeezed her eyes, her lips trembling uncontrollably, and then continued speaking.
1:12:36|1:12:42|[Dong Guilan] strained her neck and used all her strength to barely lift her head slightly off the pillow, and with a breathy voice, she said,
1:13:20|1:13:36|[Wang Deqing] heard this, feeling like a lump in his throat. He turned his back, tears streaming down his contorted face. In that moment, it seemed as if he had aged significantly.
1:13:37|1:13:45|Wang Deqing raised his head with a pained expression, suppressing himself from crying out loud, but tears kept streaming down his face.
1:14:25|1:14:32|[Fang Deng] sat quietly beside his mother, countless glistening tears sliding down her face, hanging on the tip of her fair nose, sadness shimmering.
1:14:36|1:14:57|Seeing the renewed light in her mother's eyes, [Fang Deng] knew that Dong Guilan truly loved him from the bottom of her heart. He gently leaned forward, placing his forehead on his mother's lips, a deep kiss comforting the eternal separation. Shortly after, [Fang Deng] and his father returned home, the house was a bit dark and messy.
1:14:57|1:15:5|A touch of warmth was missing, replaced by a sense of sadness. [Fang Deng] held the image of his mother and approached his distraught father, softly asking,
1:15:7|1:15:33|Wang Deqing, with tears in his eyes and a mourning armband on his arm, slowly reached out his arm. [Fang Deng] understood and handed the portrait to his father, standing obediently on the side. Wang Deqing took the frame and sat up straight, the portrait seeming incredibly heavy in his hands, pressing him forward. He had to lean his arm on the cluttered table that hadn't been tidied up for a long time.
1:15:33|1:15:37|Gently touching the cold cheek of his wife in the photo frame.
1:15:37|1:16:2|After who knows how long, [Fang Deng] took care of his mother's affairs, settled his father, and had returned to Hangzhou. The scene shifts to the main hall of Yongfu Temple, where a slender figure is devoutly prostrating in front of the golden statue of Buddha. As the figure slowly raises its head with folded hands, it reveals the slightly bulging belly of [Fang Deng]. Outside, the boys waiting anxiously see [Fang Deng] coming out of the hall and quickly put their pagers into their pockets.
1:16:2|1:16:15|Without noticing that the incense had already burned out, [Fang Deng] hurriedly paid respects and inserted it into the incense burner. [Fang Deng] glanced at the pretentious young man, then walked away on his own. Several days later, the young man chased after [Fang Deng] who was walking ahead, running out from the hospital.
1:16:59|1:17:13|Upon hearing the boy's words, [Fang Deng] turned his head incredulously and stared at him, before slowly speaking,
1:17:43|1:18:0|The boy, [Yang Zhi], is the senior who escorted Wang Deng to her dormitory when she first entered school. Wang Deng recalled the insincere clichés that [Yang Zhi] had just said, disappointedly got up and left. [Yang Zhi] stopped Wang Deng and the two stood in awkward silence for a while before Wang Deng finally spoke.
1:18:2|1:18:11|After saying that, she resolutely left. Her words were not only blaming [Yang Zhi], but also narrating her own past as a sacrifice. The scene shifts to the university basketball court.
1:18:29|1:18:42|Wang Deqing couldn't contact his daughter, so he had to come to the school to look for clues. With his hands on his waist, Wang Deqing questioned him.
1:19:6|1:19:45|Wang Deqing, filled with anger, took off his military cap, threw his coat on the nearby bicycle, and slapped [Yang Zhi] hard in the face. [Yang Zhi], knowing he was in the wrong, dispersed the classmates. Wang Deqing glared at [Yang Zhi], angrily questioning him. In his rage, he lost his former kindness and only showed the toughness of a soldier. After the questioning and venting, Wang Deqing sat alone under the shade of a tree at the school gate.
1:19:45|1:19:53|At this moment, he appeared old and emaciated, slowly propping himself up and standing up. In the shadows, he was almost indiscernible.
1:19:53|1:20:14|He watched the young students coming and going on the campus, unable to stop thinking about his daughter's whereabouts. Having already lost his beloved wife, he didn't want to experience another separation from a loved one. He walked silently on the tree-lined path, the scorching sun in Hangzhou no longer making him feel unbearable heat. It was only the silent departure of his daughter that made him feel heartbroken.
1:20:14|1:20:39|Wang Deqing put on his military uniform and walked out of his daughter's former campus slowly. In the blink of an eye, he arrived in Tangshan in 1995. The morning light shone on the newly revitalized Tangshan city, just like the dazzling dawn when Fang Da left many years ago. The spacious and clean roads were bustling with traffic, as Fang Da drove a small car, carrying a petite and lovely girl.
1:21:4|1:21:9|Hearing Fang Da's serious tone, the girl in the co-pilot seat became a bit nervous, and couldn't help but be on high alert.
1:21:9|1:21:34|The car stopped outside the alley leading to the house, and the two got out of the car, took their luggage and gifts from the car, and then [Fang Da] pushed open the big iron gate with his girlfriend and walked into the courtyard. Seeing no one responding, [Fang Da] pushed open the door of the inner room and walked in, with his girlfriend following him cautiously.
1:21:44|1:21:58|Looking at the charming girl named [Xiao He] in front of her, [Yuan Ni] nodded happily and smiled. [Fang Da] skillfully picked up the candle on the table and [Xiao He] lit it for him considerately.
1:22:18|1:22:32|After a brief chat at home, the three of them went to a restaurant for dinner in the evening. When the hot pot was served, Fang Da said, and Yuan Ni leisurely took a sip of tea before slowly getting up and sitting down on a chair.
1:22:32|1:22:40|When Yuan Ni took her seat, Fang Da and Xiao He finally sat down. Xiao He sat upright, afraid of leaving a bad impression on her future mother-in-law.
1:23:2|1:23:10|[Yuan Ni] also picked up the wine cup in front of her, and the mother and son clinked glasses and drank it all. [Fang Da] then began to introduce his situation to his mother.
1:24:19|1:24:28|Seeing his mother in front of him, who remained indifferent as he raised his glass, [Fang Da] awkwardly withdrew his arm and finished his drink in one gulp.
1:24:34|1:24:43|[Yuan Ni] picked up the wine glass and drank it all by herself, [Fang Da] saw it and his face looked unnatural.
1:24:50|1:25:11|Hearing his mother's forceful words, [Fang Da] chewed his food in silence, while [Xiao He] looked at [Yuan Ni] with her chopsticks still in midair, momentarily casting a brief silence over the dining table. After a pause, [Fang Da] continued to persuade,
1:25:16|1:25:21|Scolding her son, [Yuan Ni] puts a big piece of meat into [Xiao He]'s bowl.
1:25:41|1:25:58|A few days later, [Xiao He] drove with his mother and [Fang Da] to a brand new real estate development. In the distance, three huge cranes were still operating, constructing new buildings. The car made a turn and stopped in a spacious residential area. [Fang Da] opened the car door and said,
1:26:14|1:26:24|A nameless anger suddenly ignited in [Fang Da]'s heart. Feeling a bit at a loss, he paced back and forth for a while before running to the back seat. He complained to his mother, who refused to even get out of the car, saying,
1:26:48|1:26:56|Xiao He quickly persuaded Fang Da, who was losing control of the situation.
1:27:14|1:27:25|[Yuan Ni] had a hint of grievance on her face as she closed the car door, while [Fang Da] was panting heavily outside the car, but he was helpless.
1:27:25|1:27:52|Just as he said to [Xiao He], [Yuan Ni] is a great mother who has given herself three lives. [Fang Da], who has been living with his mother all the time, knows deeply what she has lost and sacrificed. After a brief silence, [Fang Da] gets on the car, and [Xiao He] drives them away slowly. On the other side, the long-lost [Fang Deng] appears as a tutor in a luxurious household.
1:27:52|1:27:58|The hostess, with a somewhat unnatural expression on her face, lifted a cup of tea and spoke as she entered the bedroom where her son was studying,
1:28:3|1:28:12|Taking the teacup, [Fang Deng] was about to say something when he heard the sound of glass breaking in the living room.
1:28:35|1:28:53|At the doorstep, the hostess handed over the tuition fee, but [Fang Deng] refused to accept it. The hostess did not insist, and [Fang Deng] left the luxurious residential area with her daughter. At night, the two squeezed onto a narrow bus, leaning against the door and looking out at the dim lights outside. Without looking back, she said,
1:28:57|1:29:12|[Fang Deng] said nothing, just held the child in her arms tighter. This child is her and [Yang Zhi]'s daughter. In the brilliant lights of the city under the night sky, with the constant flow of vehicles, time hurriedly passed by. It was another Chinese New Year, a day for family reunion.
1:29:12|1:29:35|[Fang Da] parked the car at the entrance of an alley outside Tangshan. [Yuan Ni] was holding a newborn baby in her arms, gently rocking and murmuring lovingly. After closing the door, [Fang Da] turned to [Xiao He] and said.
1:31:1|1:31:17|Approaching [Fang Da], she stared at him for a while and impulsively said, which made [Xiao He] immediately red-eyed, tears swirling.
1:31:23|1:31:33|Watching the mother of the grandson swaying outside the house, [Fang Da] hugged his wife and covered her mouth, afraid to make a sound.
1:31:49|1:31:57|The young couple entered the living room, already reconciled and harmonious.
1:32:11|1:32:31|[Fang Da] looked at [Xiao He] by the crib, his eyes full of reluctance. He gently tugged at her arm, and the toys hanging in the air tinkled against [Xiao He]'s head. She bent down to kiss the child, then was forcibly pulled away by [Fang Da] from Tangshan.
1:32:31|1:32:51|At the same time, in the military camp, [Wang Deqing] was rehearsing choir songs with his comrades in the grand hall. Facing the stage, soldiers were hanging lanterns cheerfully, and on the curtain, four shiny words "Celebrating the Spring Festival" were neatly displayed.
1:32:51|1:33:6|In the crowd rehearsing below the stage, [Wang Deqing] is wearing a thick cotton-padded jacket, holding a piece of paper with lyrics in one hand and pinching the collar of his clothes with the other hand, as if feeling a bit cold. At this moment, he is wearing a duckbill cap, and his temples have already turned snow white.
1:33:6|1:33:16|With a thin face and a slightly aged appearance, but still in good spirits, [Fang Da] glanced at the conductor in front of him while looking at the lyrics, singing loudly. Just then,
1:33:16|1:33:32|A soldier ran from outside the auditorium and squeezed next to [Wang Deqing]. He whispered a few words, and after hearing them, [Wang Deqing] pinched his collar, turned his head back, and looked towards the auditorium door. He stared at the figures of a tall and a short person at the door, suddenly stood up, squeezed out of the choir, and came to the entrance of the auditorium.
1:33:32|1:33:52|[Wang Deng] and his daughter, carrying their luggage, stood against the light at the entrance of the auditorium. [Wang Deqing] had never felt the winter sunlight so warm. He dragged his stiff steps, slowly walking towards his daughter in amazement. [Wang Deng] had a smile mixed with concern on her face, holding her daughter's hand as they both looked at the elderly father. The scene shifts,
1:33:52|1:33:56|Several people returned home. On the sofa in the study, [Wang Deqing] was exhaling smoke.
1:33:56|1:34:12|In the bedroom, [Fang Deng] put his daughter to sleep, carried the down jacket and scarf prepared for his father, walked out, pushed open the door, and saw his father smoking. A hint of worry appeared on [Fang Deng]'s face. He walked over and asked. [Fang Deng] extinguished the cigarette butt before speaking.
1:34:17|1:34:29|Helping her father put on his coat, [Wang Dejin] heard [Fang Deng] silently tidying up his clothes and changing the subject.
1:34:31|1:34:37|She took a scarf from the table and wrapped it around her father's neck, tying it securely. [Wang Deqing] complained as he spoke.
1:34:41|1:34:48|Watching his daughter in front of him tidying up the scarf for him, he asked, [Fang Deng] smiled and shook his head lightly, asking his father,
1:34:58|1:35:5|[Fang Deng] responded softly, feeling a bit uneasy, and hesitated in the study for a while before slowly sitting down on the sofa.
1:35:19|1:35:35|Watching the dappled light outside the window fall on his aging father, [Fang Deng] lowered his eyes and spoke softly. The father, hunched over, looked at his daughter and began to speak slowly.
1:35:37|1:35:44|Upon hearing this ridiculous reason, [Wang Deqing] trembled all over and shouted loudly while slapping the sofa,
1:35:52|1:36:18|At this moment, [Wang Deqing] let out all the years of frustration and worry. He sighed deeply and then got up to walk towards the bedroom. [Fang Deng] hurriedly followed and arrived at the bedroom. [Fang Deng] looked at his father, who was bending over the little bed, and then gazed at his sleeping granddaughter for a while. [Wang Deqing] turned his head and smiled brightly at his daughter, and years of resentment disappeared in this smile.
1:36:24|1:36:29|In the square, [Wang Deqing] ran with the rope and flew the kite.
1:36:35|1:36:49|After running for a while and feeling a bit out of breath, [Wang Deqing] smiled and handed the kite to Dian Dian. He slowly walked to the bench and sat down, watching Dian Dian running further away, panting heavily.
1:37:3|1:37:16|[Fang Deng] smiled and looked at his father. [Wang Deqing] knew well the concern parents have for their children, so he always hoped that [Fang Deng] would embark on a journey to find his roots.
1:38:2|1:38:10|The father held his daughter's hand, watching the paper kite slowly falling from the sky to the ground. He turned his head and comforted his daughter, saying,
1:38:14|1:38:23|[Fang Deng] still felt a piercing pain in her soul. She shook her head, and [Wang Deqing] sighed and comforted his daughter, saying,
1:38:34|1:38:41|Countless fireworks burst in the night sky, as the time for New Year's Eve arrived. The grieving [Fang Deng] was in the kitchen cooking.
1:38:41|1:38:56|On the TV, the Spring Festival Gala has just begun. In the bedroom, [Wang Deqing] leads his granddaughter Yuan Ni to the portrait of Dong Guilan. He pours red wine into the goblet held by Yuan Ni, then places the goblet back on the table and says,
1:39:0|1:39:23|[Wang Deqing] held Dian Dian's little hand and placed the wine glass on the table in front of the memorial tablet. In the photo, Dong Guilan looked heroic in military uniform. [Wang Deqing] bent down next to Dian Dian and asked her softly. The granddaughter nodded understandingly. [Wang Deqing] picked her up and stood up.
1:39:42|1:39:50|With a loud call from Grandma, Fang Daqiang smiled broadly, the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes showing. After a sigh, he leisurely said,
1:39:52|1:39:58|[Wang Deqing] stood in front of the memorial with Dian Dian in his arms, hoping his wife could look at their well-behaved granddaughter a little longer.
1:40:11|1:40:17|Three people sat around a table watching TV, eating and drinking. [Fang Deng] said,
1:40:44|1:41:0|Upon hearing the news, [Wang Deqing] felt a bit dazed, he nodded and waited for the next sentence.
1:41:4|1:41:16|[Wang Deqing] was stunned for a moment, repeating his daughter's words.
1:41:29|1:41:37|[Fang Deng] looked at his father, who was full of energy in the corner, chatting with his comrade on the phone.
1:41:56|1:42:9|[Wang Deng] smiled, but in an instant she realized that such a family reunion might not happen many more times. Time flies, and it's now 2008 in Hangzhou. In [Fang Da]'s travel agency, the staff were busy and warmly welcoming the guests.
1:42:43|1:42:50|Behind the desk, [Fang Da] had a phone receiver clipped to his ear, his fingers pressing the buttons on the landline phone as he dialed a number, looking at the photo of a family of four on the corner of the desk.
1:42:53|1:43:14|At the same time, on the other side of the world in Vancouver, the clouds were calm and peaceful, with just a hint of gloom in the sky. A car swiftly raced down the street, driven by a man who seemed anxious, constantly looking around. He drove fast, leaving other cars far behind. The vehicle slowed down in front of a villa, and the man turned into a small road, stopping outside the garage.
1:43:14|1:43:17|[Wang Deng], who was watering the lawn, looked at the man walking over and asked him in confusion why he had come back so early today.
1:43:19|1:43:33|The man in a casual suit, with a head of white hair shining in the sunlight, looked at the man walking towards him with a serious face. [Fang Deng] asked with some concern what was going on. The man is [Fang Deng]'s husband, and he gently held his wife's hand to tell her some very bad news.
1:43:35|1:43:43|[Fang Deng]’s first reaction was that something had happened to their daughter Dian Dian. After inquiring, her husband reassured her that Dian Dian was fine and there was no need to worry. Then, he hugged [Fang Deng] and walked towards the inner room.
1:43:59|1:44:25|On the opposite side of the TV, [Fang Deng] sat on the ground, one hand hugging her knees. She listened to the cries and wails of the refugees on the screen, and deep in her mind, a long-buried terrifying memory seemed to be awakened. Her eyes were fixed on the screen, fingers at her lips, and on her wrist was the watch her mother Dong Guilan wore before she passed away. Watching the victims trapped under the rubble in the scene, [Fang Deng] finally looked away and gazed out the window.
1:44:25|1:44:43|With his hands clutching his knees tightly, [Fang Deng] held onto his coat. At night, he opened his computer with his daughter by his side, searching for news and images related to the Wenchuan earthquake. As they looked at some unbearable photos on the screen, his daughter covered her mouth, exclaiming in disbelief that such a thing had really happened.
1:44:43|1:45:6|Beside her, [Fang Deng] was looking at these scenes. Having gone through the same experiences, she could truly empathize. Her daughter expressed her sympathy and emotions, while [Fang Deng]'s veins on her forehead bulged and her lips trembled slightly. Her heart was already a turbulent sea, and finally she couldn't help but cry out, then covered her face and wept in pain. Her daughter, startled, quickly asked what was wrong with her mother.
1:45:7|1:45:29|Shortly after, she stopped scrolling the mouse, anxiously staying by her mother's side. After a while, [Fang Deng] adjusted her state, and her daughter accompanied her to sit on the sofa in the living room. The husband, who was waiting anxiously, hurried over and asked [Fang Deng] how she was doing. Sitting beside her, he and their daughter comforted her, one on the left and one on the right. At this moment, [Fang Deng] crossed her hands and hugged her arms.
1:45:33|1:45:41|With tears streaking down her face, she calmed down slightly and softly told her father that she needed to return to China. She wanted to go to Wenchuan to help the refugees. Her husband gently touched her shoulder.
1:45:44|1:46:8|The scene shifts to the sky above Wenchuan, where several rescue helicopters are hovering towards the disaster area. On the ground, armed police soldiers have already set up camp. With a shout from the messenger, all soldiers quickly assemble. Along the edge of the road, volunteers form a convoy and rush to the disaster area to deliver relief supplies. They drive cars, ride motorcycles, and even walk, advancing towards the disaster area without hesitation.
1:46:8|1:46:18|The most eye-catching in the team are the volunteers from the Tangshan Rescue Team. On the road, in a minibus with a flag saying "When one side is in trouble, all sides come to help", [Fang Da] is making a phone call.
1:46:47|1:47:4|The minibus anxiously followed the support team ahead, heading towards the heavily affected area where the helicopter was speeding through the sky. The scene shifted to the disaster area. Similar to the Tangshan earthquake 32 years ago, the Wenchuan at this moment was a pile of ruins, with only faint traces of past attempts visible.
1:47:4|1:47:23|In the city center stands a dilapidated clock tower, with the hour hand stuck at two twenty-eight in the afternoon. On the ground, rescue soldiers and volunteers are rushing around. [Fang Deng] gets off a truck with her luggage and sees a medical team passing by. She quickly approaches and asks them a question.
1:47:30|1:47:42|So [Fang Deng] joined the medical team and hurried to the disaster relief site. On the other side, [Fang Da] clung to the outside of the fire truck and also arrived at the heavily affected area. Along the way, there were soldiers and medical staff everywhere working hard to rescue refugees.
1:47:42|1:47:54|Near a completely devastated kindergarten, soldiers are rescuing children one by one from the rubble. Beside them, medical staff immediately carry stretchers to transport the wounded to nearby rescue points.
1:48:44|1:49:9|When the aftershock struck during the conversation, the adjacent dangerous building began to shake violently. A relief soldier who didn't have time to evacuate was hit by falling rocks, lost consciousness, and fell into the ruins. After the shaking stopped, the crowd rushed up to drag the soldier out of the rubble and placed him on a stretcher.
1:49:10|1:49:28|The mother, covered in dust, stared blankly at the soldier who had fainted while trying to save her daughter. After a while, she slowly turned her head, deep in thought. Then she turned and ran towards where her daughter was trapped. She staggered through the rubble, with blood stains already dotting her feet and pants.
1:49:28|1:49:44|Sitting down in front of her daughter, she squats down, one hand resting on her daughter's shoulder, the other trembling as she strokes her daughter's legs pinned under the stone slab. [Wang Bo] is sitting next to her holding an IV drip, her clothes already covered in dust and dirt despite having arrived in the disaster area not long ago.
1:49:52|1:50:6|The mother's voice trembled as she comforted her daughter, who was covered in mud and unconscious. Then she turned to [Wang Bo] and, with great effort, shifted her gaze away from her daughter's trapped legs, and said
1:50:14|1:50:21|The mother gently touched her daughter's forehead with her worn and dusty hands.
1:50:38|1:50:59|[Wang Bo] looked at the mother in extreme pain, her gaze changing from confusion at the beginning to pity and admiration now. She called several doctors and nurses, sat behind the mother herself, gently supporting her body. Feeling the trembling of the mother in front of her, [Wang Bo] tightened her grip on her arm with pity, finally...
1:50:59|1:51:3|The girl sawed off her right leg and lay on a stretcher being taken for rescue.
1:51:27|1:51:40|[Wang Deng] firmly grabbed the [Sichuan Mother] from behind as she, already in a state of madness, recklessly rushed towards the dangerous building, tears streaming down her dirty face.
1:51:46|1:52:3|The intercepted [Sichuan Mother], with hands covered in blood, reached out blankly towards the ruins burying her daughter's limbs, wailing in agony, stirring up the deepest emotions of [Fang Deng]. At night, emergency lights shone on the ruins, continuing to dig and rescue the disaster-stricken masses.
1:52:12|1:52:25|Upon hearing the horn notification, [Fang Deng], wearing a protective suit and disinfecting the bodies of the victims, made her way to the distribution point. The heavy clothing pressed against [Fang Deng], making it difficult for her to breathe. She struggled to the distribution point and removed her face mask.
1:52:41|1:52:49|[Wang Deng] sat on the side with food in hand, looking at [Fang Da] who was twisting the bottle cap with his mouth. He spoke to a Tangshan volunteer across from him.
1:53:3|1:53:14|After speaking, the volunteer lit a cigarette, walked behind [Fang Da], sat on the track of the excavator, and asked in a more comfortable position,
1:53:53|1:54:2|On the side, [Fang Deng] looked up upon hearing this familiar story. The one-armed young man across from him, with a face covered in dust, gradually merged with the image of his brother [Fang Da] in his memory.
1:54:10|1:54:19|Sure that he was [Fang Da], [Wang Deng] listened quietly to what he would say next.
1:54:46|1:55:1|[Fang Da] finished speaking, gulping down the water in the bottle. Across from him, [Wang Deng] looked at [Fang Da], pondering over what he had just said. After experiencing such a catastrophe deeply as both a victim and a rescuer, the grudge covering the wounds on [Wang Deng]'s heart seemed to slowly peel away.
1:55:1|1:55:39|After the ending, [Fang Deng] and his brother finally recognized each other and boarded the bus back to Tangshan. Over the decades, Tangshan had changed completely without any traces of the past. [Fang Deng], preoccupied with the upcoming reunion with his birth mother, was somewhat absent-minded. When [Fang Deng] came to his senses, he looked out the window towards the location mentioned by [Fang Da], only to see a massive cube-shaped shopping mall sitting on the street, with various cars of all kinds crisscrossing on the highway.
1:55:39|1:55:45|Stylish pedestrians come and go in endless streams. Where is the memory of Tangshan in the past?
1:55:45|1:56:6|Wang Deng looked at the unfamiliar city in front of him, feeling a sense of belonging diminishing. Meanwhile, Yuan Ni, who learned that her daughter is still alive and coming home, was at home wrapping dumplings. She suppressed her excitement and guilt, kneading the dough in her palms. Xiao He noticed her mother's trembling hands and stood beside her, worried.
1:56:21|1:56:45|[Yuan Ni] listened intently for a while, then slowly said, not long after, the bus that the siblings were on stopped at the entrance of an alley outside their hometown in Tangshan. When the bus came to a halt, the two of them took their luggage and walked out of the bus. Fang Deng walked in front, looking around with a sense of curiosity. She looked at the rows of brick houses in front of her, feeling both familiar and unfamiliar.
1:56:45|1:57:14|Turning his head to look into the distance behind him, Wang Deng suddenly remembered that the dark street in his nightmare was somewhat similar to this place. [Fang Da] walked forward and pointed across the street, saying something. After hesitating for a moment, she walked towards the gate of the courtyard, with [Fang Da] following behind. Before reaching the gate, she shouted towards the house. Finally arriving at the iron gate, Wang Deng hesitated a bit.
1:57:14|1:57:42|She knew that after pushing open the door, she would see the mother who had once sacrificed herself, but what she didn't know was how to face the present [Yuan Ni] after so many years. With her eyes lowered, various complex thoughts stirred in her mind. Finally, she raised her hand and gently pushed open the door. The iron gate slowly disappeared from view. Fang Deng took in the whole courtyard and walked in to see unfamiliar women and a boy.
1:57:42|1:57:58|Through the window screen, she saw her birth mother still wrapping dumplings. [Fang Deng] politely smiled at his nephew, while [Fang Da] walked to the kitchen door and softly said to his mother,
1:58:1|1:58:8|Not knowing how to face his daughter Yuan Ni, Fang Deng lowered his head and pretended to be calm.
1:58:18|1:58:30|Wang Deng walked into the house with luggage on his back, and immediately saw his father and his own portrait, his gaze never leaving them. [Fang Da] picked up the kettle by the window and poured tea for his sister, then turned around and said,
1:58:36|1:59:4|Wang Deng ignored [Fang Da] holding the tea and walked straight to the altar where the memorial tablet was placed. [Fang Da] hurried over and quickly took away the memorial tablet of her sister. Wang Deng paid no attention, she just looked at the photos hanging near the wall, staring for a long time before a casual glance. Wang Deng saw 5 tomatoes soaking in a stainless steel basin on the table in the mourning hall. She took one out and held it in her hand, recalling the promise made by her birth mother 32 years ago.
1:59:12|1:59:26|She turned around and saw her birth mother standing up straight, slightly swaying. She saw her mother's eyes staring at her intently, and saw her eyes moisten the moment she turned around. [Yuan Ni] looked at her daughter in front of her, and she knelt stiffly on the ground, supporting herself on the sewing machine beside her.
2:0:18|2:0:29|Watching the mother on the ground with tears streaming down her face, [Fang Deng] felt her heart in turmoil and tears also fell from her eyes. She knelt down and allowed her mother to touch her face in excitement.
2:0:36|2:1:4|As night falls, amidst the dim lights of the city, countless sky lanterns carrying messages of reunion and gratitude soar into the sky. In a courtyard within the hutong, the summer insects chirp lonely, while the bedroom is dim but warm with the bedside lamp, enveloping [Yuan Ni] and [Fang Deng]. On the phone screen, she opens the album to show her birth mother, explaining to [Yuan Ni],
2:1:6|2:1:13|[Fang Deng] slid to the next photo and continued speaking.
2:1:39|2:2:1|[Yuan Ni] looked at [Fang Deng] without saying a word. Then the photo flipped to the daughter. [Yuan Ni] adjusted her glasses and carefully examined it for a while before saying something. [Fang Deng] handed the phone to his birth mother. In the dim light, [Yuan Ni] looked at the screen and examined it carefully for a long time before slowly saying,
2:2:7|2:2:14|After listening, [Yuan Ni] calculated in her mind for a moment, then turned to [Fang Deng] and asked,
2:2:35|2:2:48|During the conversation, the daughter's difficult experiences over the years made [Yuan Ni] feel extremely sorry for her. Unable to hold back, she asked, [Fang Deng] remained silent for a moment, then shook his head slowly and said.
2:2:53|2:2:58|[Yuan Ni] had a face full of concern, mixed with a hint of anxiety and confusion. She couldn't help but ask her daughter,
2:3:2|2:3:27|[Wang Deng] always avoids the gaze of her birth mother, and deep down, she still harbors resentment towards her mother. Throughout the evening, it was [Yuan Ni] who was trying to understand her past, [Wang Deng] never asked about her mother's past. The mother beside her naturally sensed her daughter's grievances. After 32 years of guilt and torment, how could she not know the taste of this lingering resentment.
2:3:27|2:3:42|She did not blame her daughter, nor did she urgently seek forgiveness from [Fang Deng]. She knew that such resentment could only be slowly worn away with time and genuine affection, so she simply stayed by her daughter's side, feeling the sadness and hardships revealed in her few words.
2:3:42|2:4:3|The next morning, the family took a bus to the cemetery on the outskirts of the city. They were dressed neatly and walked solemnly among the tombstones. They arrived at the grave of [Fang Daqiang], where [Fang Deng] placed flowers and knelt down, while [Yuan Ni] tremblingly poured white wine into a cup.
2:4:6|2:4:22|Workers opened the tombstone of [Wang Deng], [Fang Da] helped up his mother, and everyone walked towards the tombstone of [Wang Deng]. The epitaph read the grave of elder sister [Fang Deng]. [Wang Deng] stood in front of his own tombstone, looking deeply, and beside him, [Fang Da] paused and spoke,
2:4:33|2:4:39|[Fang Da] pursed his lips and looked at the mother standing opposite. [Yuan Ni] said to her son,
2:4:42|2:5:4|[Fang Deng] lowered her head and saw her Tiananmen Square backpack lying quietly on top of a bundle wrapped in brown paper inside the tomb chamber. She picked up the backpack and rubbed it in her hands. [Fang Da] untied the hemp rope wrapped around the object and opened the brown paper bag. [Wang Deng] squatted on the ground, attracted by the sound, only to see two neatly stacked textbooks underneath the brown paper.
2:5:13|2:5:38|Listening to her younger brother's solemn account, watching those old textbooks with water stains, [Fang Deng]'s deeply wounded heart began to heal. The scabs that had settled for decades started to peel off little by little. She couldn't stay in front of her own tombstone anymore. This time, it wasn't because she couldn't face the 32 years of pain, but because as a mother herself, she felt the most sincere guilt left by [Yuan Ni] in the torment of these decades.
2:5:38|2:5:55|Countless nights of entanglement in her dreams finally dissipated, leaving only the prayers and care of her mother from yesterday. Watching her daughter crying on the ground, [Yuan Ni] stepped forward to comfort her tenderly.
2:7:26|2:7:58|The mother and daughter finally embraced tightly, with [Fang Deng] resting on her mother's shoulder, tears rolling down from the corner of her eyes. [Yuan Ni] was also tearful, and the heart that had not shown any signs of life for thirty-two years was now beating violently against her daughter's chest. [Yuan Ni] gazed steadfastly at the distant sky, which was cloudless and clear, appearing in the frame. Along with it, several solemn lines of text emerged.
2:7:58|2:8:12|In 2008, the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Tangshan Municipal People's Government built a memorial wall for the 240,000 compatriots who died in the 1976 earthquake. There are a total of 5 groups of 13 walls, each inscribed with the names of the deceased.
