0:0:30|0:0:47|In the early 1940s, in a secluded village in southwest China, known as Longevity Town, the villagers lived according to 72 ancestral rules, maintaining order and harmony despite the suppression.
0:0:47|0:1:2|Ever since the appearance of [Niu Jieshi], there have been earth-shaking changes in the village. On the dusty mountain road, a four-wheeled carriage is speeding forward, the bumpy road causing the chain hanging from the back of the carriage to constantly collide. Several big men standing on the carriage, wearing black masks on their heads.
0:1:2|0:1:14|Holding a stick, Niu Jieshi fiercely strikes the sack hanging in the center. At this moment, a motorcycle honks its horn as it approaches from the corner, the driver continuously screaming, while the man sitting beside him lowers his head and tightly grips the handle.
0:1:15|0:1:21|Also frightened, he shouted loudly, and the people on the cart looked in confusion towards the direction the motorcycle was heading.
0:1:21|0:1:40|Following that, the cart stopped by the roadside, and four people on the cart lifted the sack to the edge of the cliff. With a strong push forward, the sack emitted a scream, then quickly rolled down the hill. The four individuals glanced back, then turned and walked away. At that moment, an out-of-control motorcycle came rushing down, unable to avoid the situation.
0:1:40|0:1:54|The motorcycle happened to collide with the sack rolling on the road. However, the motorcycle didn't stop, but continued to rush towards the cliff. At the last moment, the front half of the motorcycle finally stopped at the edge of the cliff, and the two of them took a deep breath with their mouths wide open.
0:1:54|0:2:5|The man got off the motorcycle first, looked back, then bent down to pick up a stone, and cautiously approached the moving sack. The motorcycle driver stood far away, carefully observing the situation.
0:2:6|0:2:16|The man slowly bent down to untie the sack, revealing a person with cotton stuffed in their mouth. The person pushed the sack open and knelt up, emitting a faint groaning sound.
0:2:55|0:3:7|Following that, [Niu Jieshi] stood up and walked towards the edge of the cliff. The intense pain in his feet contorted his entire face, and he bit the hemp rope tied to his wrist. The man stood up, dropped the stone, and turned to look.
0:3:9|0:3:23|After speaking, he spread his arms and ran down the side path in a swaying manner. The man grinned and looked at this strange person. At this moment, [Niu Jieshi], like a monkey coming out of the mountains, even on the rugged path, continued to bounce and sprint towards the foot of the mountain.
0:3:24|0:3:39|After a while, he arrived at the hill not far from the village. [Niu Jieshi] stood there, overlooking the familiar place in front of him, with houses of different heights surrounded by mountains on all sides. Then, he bent down, picked up a stone by his feet, and threw it down with force.
0:3:39|0:3:47|After a while, [Niu Jieshi] swaggered down the mayor's path, and the villagers carrying water buckets saw him and ran back home as if they had seen a ghost.
0:3:50|0:4:3|The painter working high up heard Niu Jieshi's voice and immediately grabbed the rope to climb to the roof. At that moment, Niu Jieshi was humming a tune, strolling through the streets of the town. When the villagers saw him, they quickly picked up their children and closed their doors.
0:4:28|0:4:31|The old man on the bed kept reaching out his hand towards the bedside.
0:4:58|0:5:6|Niu Jieshi walked into the courtyard, and when the neighbors saw him, they all hurriedly hid in their homes. However, a group of young people approached aggressively.
0:5:28|0:5:33|Niu Jieshi was kicked out and fell into the arms of the person opposite, then grabbed a stone.
0:6:25|0:6:41|Four men lifted up [Niu Jieshi] to leave, and at this moment, the ground began to tremble more and more violently. The onlookers hidden around watching the scene also looked around. [Niu Jieshi] looked up and glanced at the distant mountain top, only to see a huge crack suddenly appearing on the mountain peak, with flying rocks continuously smashing down on every part of the town.
0:6:41|0:7:2|Villagers screamed and ran around holding their heads. At this moment, a huge rock from the top of the mountain also rolled towards the town. The young man who was standing still and about to run away was pulled to the ground by [Niu Jieshi] lying on the ground. He crawled over and pressed the young man tightly.
0:7:6|0:7:19|After speaking, [Niu Jieshi] turned to look around, and a giant rock from the mountaintop came rushing towards them menacingly. The screen instantly plunged into darkness, with only a cloud of dust rising up. The words "Killing Lives" gradually appeared on the screen.
0:7:25|0:7:38|The man who had a chance encounter with [Niu Jieshi] before, was now walking hurriedly on the road. He kept wiping his hands covered in blood with a piece of paper, then quickly ran into a yard and pushed open the door.
0:8:1|0:8:10|The dean gestured to the person who was serving on the side to bathe, and saw that person reluctantly came to a dusty signboard and blew on it, then he continued speaking.
0:8:30|0:8:40|Days later, the man's figure appeared on the rugged mountain road. He was seen carrying a large bundle in his hands and a bulging luggage on his back, carefully moving along the top of the mountain, clinging to the rocks.
0:8:40|0:8:59|When he saw the nearby Changshou Town, Niu Jieshi smiled and whistled involuntarily. At this moment, the sound of a music box suddenly came from the valley, a hint of doubt flashed in his eyes, then he followed the sound down, and what came into view was a crudely made coffin with a music box on top of it still spinning.
0:8:59|0:9:9|He slowly placed the large bundle in his hand aside and squatted down carefully, looking at [Niu Jieshi] lying inside with half-open eyes. Then, he patted [Niu Jieshi]'s face with the back of his hand and called out.
0:9:10|0:9:26|Lying inside, [Niu Jieshi] still had his eyes half open, but his face slowly turned away. The man was so scared that he shrank back, then reached out to push the face back in place. When he set foot on the road to Changshou Town again, there was an extra [Niu Jieshi] on his back.
0:9:26|0:9:35|Before leaving, he looked back at the huge rock supported by pillars behind him, then continued on towards Changshou Town. Before long, the man arrived at a courtyard with [Niu Jieshi] on his back.
0:9:36|0:9:54|Inside, numerous goat skulls are hanging, with two pots standing on the ground. Various animal skulls are either soaking in the pots or drying on wooden boards nearby. At the entrance, a cow skull is boiling in water, and the interior structure of the house is peculiar, filled with narrow staircases. A man walks through the passage with heavy footsteps.
0:9:58|0:10:8|The surroundings were silent, and the man had to carry [Niu Jieshi] down the stairs. Due to the darkness, he missed a step and fell down the stairs, landing on the second-floor landing.
0:10:8|0:10:18|Niu Jieshi, hanging on the stairs, remained motionless in the corner. An old man passing by heard the noise, looked up, and saw Niu Jieshi with half-open eyes staring straight at him.
0:11:4|0:11:18|After understanding the situation, the man carried [Niu Jieshi] on his back, opened the door and walked out. Not far away, he heard the sound of bells nearby. Passing through another small path, a stone fell from behind. The man looked back and continued walking forward.
0:11:18|0:11:36|The entire Changshou Town was quiet, with men wandering through the alleys. At this moment, the familiar sound of a bell rang again from above. The man looked up at the roof, then continued to carry [Niu Jieshi] forward. Through the dim stone passage, a faint light shone through, and the man turned to look at the person on his back with a puzzled expression.
0:11:36|0:11:41|Not long after, Niu Jieshi arrived at the open space in front of the ancestral hall. He looked around and shouted:
0:11:48|0:11:55|The man looked towards the voice coming from the crack of the door, and a figure flashed by from inside. He immediately carried [Niu Jieshi] on his back and walked to the door.
0:12:2|0:12:19|The Doctor looked down at the iron chain and lock on the door after hearing the young man's words. He picked it up and examined the keyhole, and then a key appeared before his eyes, which was actually fished out from Niu Jieshi's neck. The two matched perfectly. Without hesitation, he opened the door and placed Niu Jieshi on the counter.
0:12:19|0:12:25|Next, the [Doctor] knelt beside and pressed his hands together, forcefully pressing on [Niu Jieshi]'s abdomen.
0:12:30|0:12:45|The [Doctor] moved his folded hands up and pressed down again, looking at the pale face of [Niu Jieshi]. At this moment, the key on the neck caught the attention of the [Doctor]. Meanwhile, a group of people wearing cloaks and carrying torches were hurrying along the road.
0:12:45|0:12:49|[Doctor] hung the key around his neck and sat on the ground with his butt.
0:12:54|0:13:3|Niu Jieshi, with a pale face and half-opened eyes, showed no signs of life. At this moment, a bell rang outside the ancestral hall, and Doctor immediately stood up and ran out.
0:13:3|0:13:12|Seeing the [Mayor] outside the ancestral hall, he hesitated for a moment, then walked down the stairs. The figure in a cloak holding a torch stood outside the door, quietly observing the unfamiliar man in front of him.
0:13:20|0:13:26|[Mayor] walked forward expressionless, took a few steps, and [Doctor] walked over, getting close to his reddened right eye, and took a look.
0:14:5|0:14:25|You must carry him back. That night, the [Doctor] brought [Niu Jieshi] to the valley. The spring water in the valley flowed continuously towards the distance. [Niu Jieshi] lay on a large rock with his belly exposed. The [Doctor] was wiping his abdomen, then turned to take out a small curved knife from his bag, looking at it for a long time.
0:14:25|0:14:38|With a determined look in his eyes, he turned on the overhead light and squatted down to pat [Niu Jieshi]'s face. The small curved knife slowly approached and pierced into [Niu Jieshi]'s abdomen, sliding straight down.
0:14:38|0:14:53|[Doctor] supported his belly with one hand, carefully watching the path of the curved knife. The blade extended from the abdomen to the navel. Then he stretched out his hands, forcefully pulling the belly apart. The torchlight reflected on [Doctor]'s face, but little did he know what was happening not far away.
0:14:53|0:15:12|A stranger in a coat is silently observing everything, holding a pocket watch in his hand. The next morning, the [Doctor] throws a fishing line onto the outer wall of Changshou Town, then he struggles to climb up by pulling the rope with all his strength. Sitting on the wall, he catches his breath and silently observes the situation in Changshou Town.
0:15:12|0:15:18|A group of people wearing long cloaks were seen heading towards the same place, not far away.
0:15:29|0:15:46|The person in a cloak was discussing about [Niu Jieshi]. At that moment, the [Doctor] hiding behind the wall cautiously peeked out, observing their movements. Hearing a noise behind him, the [Doctor] nervously looked back, only to see the person wearing a military cap and armor immediately turning around and fleeing.
0:15:46|0:15:50|The doctor hurriedly followed and caught up with the person, then arrived at a small door.
0:16:0|0:16:17|The boy pointed and laughed at the key on Doctor's chest. Doctor smiled, raised his hand to take off the key and held it in front of the child. The child reached out to grab it, but Doctor leaned back. The boy, angry, tried to hit Doctor but was caught by him.
0:16:25|0:16:37|He smiled, turned around, unzipped the backpack behind him, and pulled out a small collapsible stand. Then, he picked up the top layer of the stethoscope, brought it to the boy's ear, and placed the other end on his own chest.
0:16:49|0:17:0|Upon hearing this, [Niu Jieshi] wiped the silly grin off his face and immediately turned serious. He then slowly raised his hand and pointed towards the window inside the house, prompting everyone to turn and look in the direction he was pointing.
0:17:0|0:17:12|With the camera moving, the view gradually extends from the window to the entire town of Changshou. Grey stone buildings cover every corner, and everyone in the town is doing their own thing in an orderly manner.
0:17:12|0:17:22|At the same time, all the women in the town were standing on the rooftops drying their clothes, banging their bamboo tubes loudly as they walked through every alleyway to alert the surrounding residents.
0:17:28|0:17:47|Residents holding wooden buckets next to them lined up one by one to fetch water, the mountain spring water in the ditch never stopped flowing, continuously sent to various places through the dark tunnels. Dividing and converging, the memories of youth also flowed back in the direction of the water, the spring water at that time was as clear and transparent as a mirror.
0:17:48|0:18:4|Flowing from the underground stone passage to various places for residents to use, the water gradually becomes calm. A graceful reflection appears on the water surface. The scene shifts indoors, where a woman with long hair wrapped in a towel around her lower body, water droplets from her hair slowly sliding down onto her soft abdomen.
0:18:4|0:18:17|Slowly pouring the essential oil onto her hands and rubbing it onto her back, the woman closed her eyes and savored the fragrant aroma enveloping her body. Gently massaging the residue on her hands, she was completely unaware of the person standing behind her.
0:18:24|0:18:29|[Niu Jieshi] was puzzled and turned to look, only to see the woman trying to escape, but he quickly caught her and held her in his arms.
0:19:8|0:19:17|[Niu Jieshi] quietly slipped into the old man's bedside during the chaos, holding a bottle of wine close to the old man's nose. He then pulled out the night pot from the side and poured the wine from the bottle into it.
0:19:17|0:19:25|Next, he smiled and picked up the other end of the opium pipe, gently inserting it into the old man's mouth. The old man took a few puffs and soon stopped breathing.
0:19:31|0:19:35|The old man's premature drinking and peeping caused anger among all the people in Longevity Town.
0:19:35|0:19:50|[Niu Jieshi], as the instigator of this incident, was chased and cursed by the entire town. He could be seen running frantically through the alleys, hands clutching his head, with angry residents wielding cages following closely behind. The long sticks in their hands were about to strike him.
0:19:50|0:19:54|[Niu Jieshi] picked up a stick, turned around and shouted, and [Painter] emerged from the other end.
0:19:59|0:20:11|[The Painter] was frightened, but the young man behind him was not afraid at all, and he chased after him with determination. [Niu Jieshi] was scared again and ran frantically. He ran up the stairs, opened the door, then turned around and picked up a wooden stick to swing wildly a few times before jumping out.
0:20:11|0:20:26|Seeing [Niu Jieshi] about to escape, the young men pushed open the door and chased after him. However, they immediately fell below the high wall, as it turned out there was nothing behind the door. Unaware of this, the people behind continued to push forward. Taking advantage of the chaos, [Niu Jieshi] grabbed the rope on the wall and climbed to the highest point.
0:20:52|0:21:2|Upon hearing what the [Mayor] said, everyone lowered their heads, no longer displaying their previous arrogance. Subsequently, the camera passed through a narrow underground passage and arrived at a door.
0:21:24|0:21:40|At this moment, [Blacksmith] is lost in memories. In the pouring rain, [Niu Jieshi] is bare-chested, wearing only a pair of shorts to cover himself. He is seen playfully splashing water from a ladle onto the girls around him, causing them to scream in surprise.
0:21:40|0:21:50|The blacksmith recalled this scene with such hatred that he broke the wooden stick in his hand. In his memory, he walked up behind Niu Jieshi, and then forcefully pushed Niu Jieshi's head into the water tank.
0:21:53|0:22:6|Immediately, he lifted [Niu Jieshi] with one hand and threw him onto the stone slab, delivering a fierce blow to his abdomen. Before [Niu Jieshi] could react, the blacksmith, as strong as an ox, grabbed his hair and repeatedly slammed his head against the wall.
0:22:23|0:22:28|The butcher [Niu Boss] cut the meat with a knife, lost in memories about [Niu Jieshi].
0:23:4|0:23:9|[Niu Jieshi] raised his axe and looked at the plaque of the Niu ancestors, which made [Widow Ma] extremely frightened.
0:23:53|0:24:17|The painter looked into the distance with a pensive expression, slowly raising his hand. The wife placed her legs on the painter's shoulders, but he suddenly stopped.
0:24:45|0:24:50|The painter jabbed the floor with an iron rod, while his wife shouted angrily holding an axe.
0:25:4|0:25:18|[The Painter] quickly ran up the wooden ladder, trying to intercept [Niu Jieshi]. [Niu Jieshi] ran forward as if his feet were oiled, quickly escaping, and [The Painter] leaped down from the high wall and quickly caught up.
0:25:18|0:25:26|But at this moment, a big knife suddenly appeared above his head. He looked up fearfully and saw [Niu Jieshi] jumping directly in front of him, approaching step by step.
0:25:45|0:25:59|After speaking, [Niu Jieshi] put away the big knife at the feet of the [Painter]. The [Painter], who had lifted his leg, was startled and took a sharp breath, his body uncontrollably swaying. [Niu Jieshi] turned around, revealing a fierce gaze. The [Painter] hurriedly tried to stay still, and then [Niu Jieshi] walked away with the knife.
0:26:30|0:26:43|At this moment, a group of residents wearing cloaks were squatting by the waterway, wetting their cloths to wipe their faces. [Niu Jieshi] had a piece of grass in his mouth, getting ready to go down the mountain. From afar, he saw a ceremony taking place in the town, with a group of residents wearing cloaks.
0:26:46|0:27:2|Several burly men, bare-chested, swinging their arms and slapping their thighs, while the old man who was being blamed lay on the wooden boat. Beside him sat the mute [Widow Ma]. The [Mayor] walked solemnly at the front of the boat, and the [Widow Ma] sitting on the boat looked ahead calmly, a hint of despair in her eyes.
0:27:2|0:27:12|The people behind the wooden boat lined up in a queue, raising and lowering their hands in a repetitive motion. They slowly moved forward, each person with a sad expression on their face.
0:27:14|0:27:23|[Niu Jieshi] sat on the hill with a look of curiosity on his face, observing their every move. But just as he was about to reach his limit, everyone suddenly stopped in their tracks, pounding their chests and shouting towards the sky.
0:27:50|0:28:5|Widow Ma put on the cloak and hat, a few shirtless men pushed the wooden boat to the center of the lake. The people on the shore silently watched the body and Widow Ma's disappearing figure. Only the Mayor on the shore shouted again.
0:28:8|0:28:20|Upon hearing the command, everyone clasped their hands together in front of their chests, bowed, and knelt down. At that moment, on a distant wooden boat, the figure of [Widow Ma] gradually drifted away, motionless, and fell into the lake.
0:28:24|0:28:33|[Widow Ma] silently looked at the deep, bottomless lake, then slowly closed her eyes, waiting for death to come. The people on the shore still bowed their heads in prayer.
0:28:40|0:28:51|The painter's wife widened her eyes when she saw it, grabbed the mayor who was kneeling in front of her, only to see Niu Jieshi emerging from the water, shaking his wet hair, with Widow Ma still in his hand.
0:28:51|0:29:2|[Mayor] saw this scene and widened his eyes in surprise. [Niu Jieshi] struggled to swim and dragged [Widow Ma] to the shore. Then, he panted heavily as he carried [Widow Ma] and walked in front of [Mayor].
0:29:14|0:29:25|[Mayor] lowered his head as he watched [Niu Jieshi] walk away, and the others didn't know what to say. The next morning, [Widow Ma]'s cloak and bellyband were fluttering in the wind above the ancestral hall.
0:29:25|0:29:37|In a state of coma, [Widow Ma] lay on a blanket, exposing her smooth back. She furrowed her brows, slightly opened her eyes, and then turned over. It was only at this moment that she realized she was in a strange environment.
0:29:38|0:29:48|Suddenly, a suspicious sound came to his ears, and he immediately sat up. He then wrapped the thin blanket covering him around his body and listened carefully to the movements outside.
0:29:48|0:29:57|He then picked up a small axe next to the bed and walked out slowly. There, he saw a man with bare arms hiding behind a water tank, constantly making painful groaning sounds.
0:29:58|0:30:12|[Widow Ma] slowly approached, but [Niu Jieshi] stood up, both hands covered in blood. He was so scared that he raised the axe, but when he turned around and saw [Niu Jieshi] with half of his face covered in blood, he dropped the axe in fear and then fainted on the ground.
0:30:12|0:30:16|[Niu Jieshi] held a knife in one hand and a bowl in the other, smiling as he glanced at the fainting [Widow Ma].
0:30:17|0:30:31|Immediately after he dropped the knife from his hand, he wiped the remaining blood on his hand onto the winding path. At this moment, the residents were standing in place, watching Widow Ma's clothes fluttering above the ancestral hall. They were whispering in small groups about Widow Ma's situation.
0:30:31|0:30:41|After a while, the frightened [Widow Ma] regained consciousness. She turned her head and saw [Niu Jieshi] sleeping beside her, with dried bloodstains still visible at the corners of her mouth.
0:30:41|0:30:51|[Niu Jieshi] was already fast asleep in bed, while [Widow Ma] wrapped in a thin cloth slowly opened the door and walked out. She walked down the stairs barefoot, unaware that several pairs of eyes were already watching her.
0:30:51|0:31:1|As they entered the alley, [Widow Ma] was followed by several women who gathered together, whispering among themselves. [Widow Ma] glanced back and then continued walking forward.
0:31:1|0:31:13|Arriving at the corner, the wife of the [Painter] stood with her hands on her hips in the middle of the alley. [Widow Ma] lowered her head and walked to the left, and the other person followed suit. Then, she moved to the other side, and the other person moved along.
0:31:16|0:31:32|At this moment, the [Painter]'s wife suddenly walked up to him, sniffing at his lips and neck incessantly. Perplexed, [Widow Ma] leaned her body back, only to see the other person glaring at her fiercely. Then, the person looked down below, followed by a punch to her abdomen.
0:31:32|0:31:38|The painter's wife grabbed Widow Ma's chin, but got blood on the corner of her mouth. She rubbed her fingers.
0:32:1|0:32:11|Upon hearing the instructions from the [Painter]'s wife, everyone immediately stopped quarreling. [Widow Ma] knelt on the ground, sobbing softly. Then the [Painter]'s wife took out a packet of medicine.
0:32:11|0:32:20|Widow Ma glanced at the package, then looked up at the painter's wife. At that moment, her face revealed the marks of a struggle, and her eyes were filled with resentment.
0:32:20|0:32:27|Widow Ma slowly approached the painter's wife, staring straight at her, then stood still and tore off the cloth on her body.
0:32:28|0:32:42|The women beside her lowered their heads unwilling to look at him, especially when the daughter-in-law gritted her teeth and approached, but [Widow Ma] held her head high without fear. After they left, [Widow Ma] finally put away her strong facade, a hint of sadness showing in her eyes.
0:32:55|0:33:13|At night, [Niu Jieshi] walked alone on the street, holding a few sausages in his hand. He saw an old man playing the drum by the roadside, and he walked up with a smile, placing the sausages on the drum surface. Then, following the rhythm, he hung the sausages around his neck and danced with swinging arms up and down. Soon after, he walked through the underground passage.
0:33:13|0:33:22|Looking at the fresh sausage in his hand, Niu Jieshi couldn't help but smile happily, completely unaware of the several people with straw hats behind him. When he reached the door, he stuck out his butt and peered through the crack in the door.
0:33:24|0:33:30|At this moment, someone made a cross on his buttocks and inserted a long needle tube diligently.
0:33:34|0:33:43|The group of people wearing straw hats continued to chase after [Niu Jieshi], causing him to flee in panic. No matter which alley he turned into, the people with straw hats would always appear.
0:33:43|0:33:52|[Niu Jieshi] kept cursing non-stop, but his legs never stopped moving. The needles stuck in his buttocks were flung to the ground by him, and then his movements gradually slowed down.
0:33:53|0:34:12|Suddenly, a man knelt on the ground, his eyes becoming unfocused, and then he fainted. The crowd took off their hats and stood around. It turned out that the demon was carrying out its plan. At that moment, a man wearing a military cap walked over with a syringe. The fool nodded with a silly smile, and [Widow Ma] spoke.
0:34:14|0:34:48|Several women worked together to turn [Niu Jieshi] over. They pulled down [Niu Jieshi]'s pants and upon seeing it, they all closed their eyes. [Widow Ma] widened her eyes and took a closer look. She then grabbed a knife and headed towards the man. Unexpectedly, [Niu Jieshi] struggled and sat up. The women pushed [Niu Jieshi] towards the needle in the fool's hand.
0:34:53|0:35:10|The woman whose pants were torn screamed and left, followed by the fool. On the other side, [Niu Jieshi] lay on the ground, constantly reaching out to touch the woman's skirt, scaring her away. [Widow Ma] grabbed [Niu Jieshi] by the collar, but he turned around and picked him up directly.
0:35:38|0:35:52|The scene returns to reality, a withered tree on the cliff swaying in the cold wind. At this moment, [Niu Jieshi] lies peacefully in the cave. Suddenly, the entire mountain starts shaking uncontrollably, with [Widow Ma] sitting on the side expressionless, furrowing her brows.
0:35:52|0:36:3|Next, lying directly beside [Niu Jieshi], he stared blankly at the swaying cliff, then turned to look at the pale [Niu Jieshi] beside him, once again falling into the memories the young man had mentioned.
0:36:45|0:37:1|The scene returns to the beginning of the movie, with Niu Jieshi being carried in a sack due to the polluted water. They hang Niu Jieshi in the carriage, beating him with sticks. The out-of-control Doctor passes by the carriage, hitting the sack that was thrown down, preventing it from falling off the cliff.
0:37:6|0:37:20|From this point on, [Niu Jieshi] began his revenge plan. The barrel of explosives was pulled out by [Niu Jieshi] and thrown at the feet of the blacksmith hiding behind the rocks. While the [Mayor] was in the restroom, the wooden board was torn apart by a rope.
0:37:23|0:37:39|Half Immortal, whose glasses were stolen, squinted as he opened the door, only to find a huge beehive above his head. With a loud explosion, the blacksmith and [Painter] were coughing in the dust. The blacksmith, who was sleeping, heard the sound of sharpening knives and immediately sat up.
0:37:39|0:37:47|[Niu Jieshi] walked along the wall with an iron saw, while the blacksmith listened to the sound all the way, crawling from the foot of the bed to the head of the bed, only to hear the sound coming from all directions outside the house.
0:37:48|0:37:56|The blacksmith held up a spear against the roof, but still got a hole smashed by [Niu Jieshi]. In order to control the crazy behavior of [Niu Jieshi], [Doctor Niu] injected medicine into the cured meat.
0:38:12|0:38:24|The townspeople couldn't bear [Niu Jieshi]'s harassment and tried various ways to teach him a lesson. However, [Niu Jieshi] stood side by side with a group of children and urinated on the wall.
0:38:36|0:39:2|Yu Qijiang slowly placed his wife on the bed and pressed down urgently. Just as they were getting into it, the demon suddenly saw a bright light in front of him, and the wooden board on the roof had been lifted. Yu Qijiang turned to look, and the demon let out a howl. After speaking, the fool put down the wooden board, and Niu Jieshi laughed and left.
0:39:25|0:39:41|Banshen looked at Doctor Niu holding a syringe, and was so scared that he immediately went upstairs. Doctor Niu tapped the empty syringe twice, looked to the side, and a wicked smile appeared on his face. Soon, Banshen heard a commotion and ran downstairs, only to see a donkey lying on the needle of Widow Ma.
0:39:41|0:39:43|Banshen saw this scene and collapsed on the ground.
0:39:50|0:40:4|Following that, [Doctor Niu] arrived at the entrance upstream with aphrodisiac powder in hand, slowly sprinkling it into the water. Under the continuous flow of water, the aphrodisiac powder had already merged with it, and then the water flowed through different channels to every corner of Changshou Town.
0:40:4|0:40:22|In the lake area, the rushing river at this moment is also transporting towards the distance like a gust of wind, causing layers of embossed patterns to be built inside the uneven pipes, and the crisscrossing waterways are scattered throughout the entire town. Before long, the water flow gradually becomes calm, gently gliding over the smooth pipes. Flowing forward slowly.
0:40:22|0:40:30|At this moment, the residents downstream are either rinsing rice with water or washing vegetables, while the women are chatting as usual about daily life.
0:40:31|0:40:49|Yao Shen took a sip of tea, when the [Painter] blew at his feet, his body reacted inexplicably. The semi-immortal lay on the chair, leisurely drinking from the gourd in his hand. The [Painter] boldly picked up a bottle of wine and poured it into his mouth. Each person in the village drank water containing aphrodisiac powder at different times.
0:40:58|0:41:6|The farce came to a halt, with clothes scattered all over the streets of Changshou Town. Inside the house, [Mayor]'s people gathered, their faces showing signs of distress.
0:41:19|0:41:37|At this moment, [Niu Jieshi] climbed onto the roof, came down the wooden ladder, opened a door and walked in. The blacksmith stood not far away, watching [Niu Jieshi] disappear. Inside the house, [Widow Ma] lay on the bed tossing and turning, unable to resist the strong reactions in her body. She grabbed the sheet with one hand, closed her eyes, mouth slightly open, breathing heavily.
0:41:37|0:41:44|At this moment, a hand appeared at Widow Ma's waist. In confusion, she grabbed hold of this warm hand, but instantly became clear-headed again.
0:41:46|0:41:59|[Widow Ma] struggled to sit up, exerting all her strength to break free from the embrace, only to see that the person who barged into the room was [Niu Jieshi]. [Niu Jieshi] smiled at the dumbfounded [Widow Ma], immediately got up and pushed her back onto the bed.
0:41:59|0:42:10|After speaking, she leaned in and kissed [Widow Ma] on the face, but the latter immediately dodged. [Widow Ma] pushed her upper body away and hurriedly crawled out. [Niu Jieshi] then grabbed her waist, causing [Widow Ma] to push him away in fear.
0:42:40|0:42:57|Seeing [Niu Jieshi]'s unruly appearance, [Widow Ma] raised her hand and lightly slapped him. After speaking, [Niu Jieshi] once again pinned [Widow Ma] beneath him, and at this moment, her eyes had already become hazy. Before long, the two in the tent were immersed in the joy of spring night.
0:42:57|0:43:3|The blacksmith, who witnessed everything, sat dejectedly on the ground. He slapped his forehead in frustration and started crying helplessly.
0:43:8|0:43:22|Lying on the lap of [Niu Jieshi], [Widow Ma] immediately sat up when she heard a sound, only to find that the sound was coming from inside the quilt. She lay back down and stuck her head in, only to see [Niu Jieshi] holding a music box and extending his arm outside, with [Widow Ma] following suit and crawling out.
0:43:23|0:43:40|He reached out to grab the music box from [Niu Jieshi], but she smiled and switched it to the other hand. [Widow Ma] paid no attention, pressing on [Niu Jieshi]'s chest and taking this novel toy. He held the music box tightly, constantly winding it up, his eyes fixed on [Niu Jieshi] lying beside him.
0:43:40|0:43:43|At this moment, [Niu Jieshi] squinted his eyes, stretched out his arms, and grinned.
0:43:48|0:44:4|Early the next morning, there was a commotion in the sky above Changshou Town. A man was seen chasing out of his house with a stick, while a woman in front of him ran away in fear. Not far away, another woman was holding a corn cob and throwing it at the shirtless man. Some young men and women couldn't help but get intimate during the day.
0:44:4|0:44:11|Middle-aged men were wrestling, while the women were pulling and scolding. Upon seeing all this, the [Mayor] couldn't help but sigh.
0:44:22|0:44:26|[Mayor] opened his cloak, looked into the distance, and then spoke.
0:44:28|0:44:45|As soon as the words fell, a young man with glasses sat in the passenger seat of the truck, using his gloved hand to wipe the dusty rearview mirror. Several people wearing cloaks sat silently in the back of the truck, as the dust flew up from the yellow earth. The truck headed towards Changshou Town, and then the scene shifted.
0:44:45|0:44:48|The camera lingers on a house in Changshou Town.
0:44:56|0:45:3|[Doctor Niu] wrote the four characters of "Newborn Baby" and hung them on the wooden plaque, then turned around with a hint of malice in his eyes.
0:45:42|0:46:7|The scene shifts, with [Doctor] accompanying the young man to the place where they used to meet. The young man smiled at [Doctor], then quickly ran out. [Doctor] approached and observed the furnishings inside the house, then turned to look at the cushions and stools opposite, recalling once again what the young man had said.
0:46:9|0:46:22|At this moment, the people in the room are engaged in a heated discussion, especially [Widow Ma] who is gesturing wildly. On the side, the butcher [Niu Jieshi] points and argues back. [Doctor Niu] looks at his pocket watch and glances at the still debating crowd.
0:46:41|0:46:54|At this moment, [Niu Jieshi] joyfully rides his bicycle through the alleys of Changshou Town. He looks up excitedly at the rapidly retreating sky, but as he reaches the downhill road, the bicycle suddenly becomes uncontrollable.
0:46:54|0:47:1|In the alley, people were scared and dodging. [Niu Jieshi] quickly pressed the brakes, but the bicycle still didn't stop. He couldn't help but scream in fear.
0:47:3|0:47:13|[Niu Jieshi] crashed through the door and fell in a room, then stumbled out from the side door, only to collapse on the ground after a few steps, grimacing in pain.
0:47:35|0:47:45|The butcher [Niu Jieshi] boss smiled happily, wielding his knife to chop the pork on the cutting board. [Niu Jieshi] continued walking forward, and a girl who saw him quickly hid to the side. He grabbed the girl and asked.
0:47:50|0:48:6|The girl turned her head to look at [Niu Jieshi], one of her eyes red and terrifying. Then, he directly dropped the basket, slapped his grabbed arm, and hurriedly ran back home. [Niu Jieshi] held the basket, passing by a stall selling chicken meat. The boss's hand shook, causing the knife to fall into the iron basin.
0:48:6|0:48:8|He turned his head, and the boss explained in a fluster.
0:48:34|0:48:38|He squatted down and turned to look at the mother and daughter, but the [Midwife] pulled out a strand of his hair.
0:48:57|0:49:10|[Midwife] did not answer, but directly put the tuft of hair into the stove, and the flames immediately became vigorous. At this moment, the scene shifted to [Doctor], who was seen cutting out a piece of paper from the ashes, and then carefully examining it in front of his eyes for a long time.
0:49:10|0:49:19|He widened his eyes, leaned in to take a closer look, then took out the charred wooden frame and placed the remaining pieces of paper on it, gesturing.
0:49:19|0:49:29|Next, [Doctor] sat in front of a bronze mirror, seen him using his fingers to open his eyes, looking at himself in the reflection of the mirror, then he opened his mouth, touched his chin and neck.
0:49:34|0:49:41|The fool burst into laughter at the words of [Doctor], who grinned with his mouth open and eyes squinted. Then the scene shifted back to the memory of [Niu Jieshi].
0:49:48|0:49:55|[Niu Jieshi] gritted his teeth, grabbed the girl's chin, and the old man pulled her hand. When she let go, the two hurriedly left.
0:50:9|0:50:28|Guamei's mockery made [Niu Jieshi] start to doubt again. He walked to the water channel, bent over and looked at his face in the reflection, but there was a hint of blood in the water. As he was surprised and getting up, he found someone standing behind him. The person glanced at [Niu Jieshi], said nothing, and immediately ran off with the meat.
0:50:28|0:50:36|After cursing, he immediately took a shortcut to intercept the man. The man was so scared that he threw the meat onto [Niu Jieshi]'s back.
0:50:45|0:51:0|At this moment, two people arrived and carried the meat away. The confused [Niu Jieshi] turned to look at the person who had just carried the meat.
0:51:13|0:51:26|[Niu Jieshi] refused to give up and arrived at the competition scene. The child across from him gestured with his finger, and [Niu Jieshi] sat down in front of him tirelessly. The two began to compete in arm wrestling.
0:51:36|0:51:41|After losing the match, [Niu Jieshi] looked dejected, a girl walked silently past him and he glanced at her.
0:52:3|0:52:15|He turned back and pulled the head rope off Widow Ma. Niu Jieshi walked along the road, tying the head rope to his wrist as he walked forward. Doctor Niu stopped him.
0:52:36|0:52:40|He played with the head rope while looking at the meat on the cutting board, carefully selecting from left to right.
0:52:43|0:52:52|[Niu Jieshi] inserted the head rope into the opening of the meat strip, picked up two pieces of meat, compared their sizes, and [Doctor Niu] stared closely at the two pieces of meat.
0:53:2|0:53:19|He smiled and threw back a piece of meat before turning away. [Doctor Niu] picked up the meat, examined it carefully, and then hung it on the wooden board behind. But not long after, the piece of meat hung by [Doctor Niu] oozed out a puddle of medicine. The large stone supported by the wood stood tall on the mountain top.
0:53:19|0:53:22|At this moment, [Niu Jieshi] sat on Widow Ma's bed, recalling recent events.
0:53:37|0:53:51|Shortly after, he took off his shirt, revealing his arms, still looking puzzled. [Widow Ma] reached out and hooked her hand around his neck. [Niu Jieshi] lay down on top of [Widow Ma], and before long, the distracted [Niu Jieshi] called it quits.
0:53:51|0:53:56|Widow Ma, who didn't have enough fun, pouted and kissed him, but he frowned tightly, with no response.
0:53:58|0:54:4|After speaking, he turned over and lay beside [Widow Ma], letting out a deep sigh.
0:54:4|0:54:19|Seeing [Niu Jieshi] feeling troubled, [Widow Ma] thought for a moment. She then turned around, raised her hand to touch [Niu Jieshi]'s face, and proceeded to kiss his head. However, [Niu Jieshi] stared blankly at the ceiling, his mind consumed by doubts. At that moment, a photo of an elderly couple appeared on the screen.
0:54:20|0:54:36|Next to the stone wall hangs a series of photos of [Doctor Niu] from childhood to adulthood. The [Doctor] looks up at the wall, and the scene freezes on a recent photo of [Doctor Niu]. Upon closer observation, he discovers [Doctor Niu]'s graduation photo and alma mater, only to realize that [Doctor Niu] and himself graduated from the same school.
0:54:36|0:54:40|Later, he noticed the few lines of text on the old couple's photo, which read,
0:54:48|0:55:8|In the next scene, we see young [Niu Jieshi] crouching on the wall. He opens a small window and extends a long stick inside. As he approaches the cured meat on the wall, he moves the clamp on the end of the stick to cut the string. Just as he is about to succeed, he is discovered by Doctor Niu's grandfather. After a long standoff, [Niu Jieshi] manages to snatch the meat and escape.
0:55:8|0:55:16|Niu Wa, also known as [Doctor Niu] when he was young, was seen stuffing the entire window with wood and then nervously tapping it with a hammer.
0:55:47|0:55:58|The boy held a photo frame in his hands, then stood up and handed it to [Doctor]. He took out the photo frame and looked at it, inside was an X-ray photo. Then he picked up the file bag underneath.
0:56:1|0:56:11|The name Niu Jieshi was written on the file bag, and the person checking the condition was Doctor Niu. The Doctor looked through the records in the file bag and recalled the morning when he arrived in Changshou Town.
0:56:14|0:56:28|In the morning, after he came out from the dean's office holding something, a group of people in cloaks were carrying something inside. Distracted, he accidentally bumped into someone. At that moment, he finally realized that the person he bumped into was [Doctor Niu].
0:56:28|0:56:38|Soon after, he smiled and put the cloak's hat on his head. Immediately after, the figure of [Doctor] appeared in the alley. The person wearing the cloak passed by him, and he quickly turned around, quietly following behind.
0:56:38|0:56:53|The person in front reached out and shook the bell, the [Doctor] in a cloak also followed suit. When they arrived, the [Doctor] quietly stopped and then pushed open the door next to them, carrying a box and walking in. Inside the innermost room, there was a noisy bell ringing, and the [Doctor] walked over with the bag on their back.
0:56:54|0:57:5|Seeing someone inside, he stood at the door and looked around, only to see bells hanging on the loom. [Doctor Niu] was sitting inside, working quickly, paying no attention to the [Doctor] standing at the door.
0:57:5|0:57:15|At this moment, the [Doctor] was whistling and humming the melody from the music box of [Niu Jieshi]. Upon hearing the sound, [Doctor Niu] slowly stopped the loom, with an unusually cold expression.
0:57:35|0:57:42|[Doctor] walked over with a smile, grabbed the bell on the loom, and the smile on [Doctor Niu]'s face suddenly disappeared.
0:58:31|0:58:55|After speaking, he picked up the bell in his hand, and a melody of bells rang out. A young man was seen squatting at the highest point of the 10th floor, waving his hand. Following that, everyone relied on the bell to pass on information. [Niu Jieshi] appeared at the alley entrance riding a bicycle, with a cloth bag hanging around his neck.
0:58:55|0:59:0|He then rode his bicycle forward again, but was stopped by a nervous big man.
0:59:11|0:59:27|[Niu Jieshi] pushed away the big man, the women beside him chuckled, but the baby in their arms was wailing. After cursing, [Niu Jieshi] rode away on his bicycle, only to see the big man turn his head and reveal a meaningful smile.
0:59:27|0:59:40|At night, [Niu Jieshi] wearing a cloak, walked alone through the dark underground passage. From a distance, he could hear a lively noise. He quickly climbed the stairs and crossed a narrow wooden bridge to arrive at the wedding banquet, where he was unrecognized and called out to.
0:59:48|1:0:5|In this scene, [Niu Jieshi] emerges from the ancestral grave of the Niu family, looking disheveled and holding a silver bracelet in his hand.
1:0:10|1:0:15|Chased to fight, but stopped by the crowd, while [Niu Jieshi] slipped away and ran to the roof.
1:0:51|1:1:0|After speaking, Mayor raised his glass and drank it all in one gulp. [Niu Jieshi] looked around and also picked up his bowl to drink heartily. At this moment, everyone was observing his reaction.
1:1:19|1:1:37|[Niu Jieshi] immersed in a peaceful atmosphere, happily lifted the wine bowl. The residents beside him shook the bell with their hands behind their backs, and the girl next to him immediately stood up to toast. After drinking a few bowls, [Niu Jieshi] showed signs of intoxication, with wine uncontrollably flowing out of his mouth. In disbelief, she looked to the side and saw everyone enjoying themselves.
1:1:37|1:1:55|She turned her head to the other side and saw the seventy-year-old man pouring wine into his mouth. The woman drank a big bowl, which drew cheers from the others. Refusing to be outdone, [Niu Jieshi] gritted his teeth and started drinking as well. The young man helping to pour the wine looked at [Niu Jieshi].
1:1:55|1:2:12|The people drinking next to him were also quietly watching [Niu Jieshi]'s reaction. By now, [Niu Jieshi] had already turned red from drinking, his eyes swollen. He watched the bottle of wine moving back and forth on each table, while everyone else was still in high spirits, not feeling as uncomfortable as he was. At that moment, the demon suddenly shouted.
1:2:45|1:3:2|After speaking, he lifted the wine bowl again. He struggled to turn his head, opened his mouth to find the salt in the bowl, but the wine in his mouth uncontrollably flowed out. His eyes blurred, he furrowed his brow and looked around. He collapsed on the ground after a short while. The people beside him dared not speak as they watched Niu Jieshi fall to the ground.
1:3:2|1:3:4|Yi Qijiang led [Demon God] forward.
1:3:28|1:3:44|[Widow Ma] witnessed all this from a distance. The next morning, [Niu Jieshi] picked up a bronze mirror and carefully examined his teeth. He pulled open his eyelids and looked, then touched his neck. At that moment, the sound of a child crying outside made him instantly angry, and he rushed out.
1:3:44|1:3:49|When Niu Jieshi appeared, the children fell silent instantly.
1:4:6|1:4:21|The children were scared and crying, but obediently urinated with him. [Niu Jieshi] was trying hard, his face twisted, but still couldn't urinate. The wolf dog beside him growled, and he turned his head to stare at it fiercely. At this moment, the young man climbed up the wall.
1:4:33|1:4:37|One hand grabbed the boy's foot, pulled him down, and then he was locked in the room.
1:4:45|1:5:2|[Doctor Niu] instructed [Niu Jieshi] to leave. [Niu Jieshi] smiled and took out the largest piece of meat in the shop and placed it on the cutting board. [Doctor Niu] looked up at the meat hanging on the wall and chose a lean piece.
1:5:2|1:5:8|Boss Niu turned around with a smile, looking at the piece of meat on the wall that was supposed to be given to Niu Jieshi, hesitating for a long time.
1:5:10|1:5:33|[Doctor Niu] stared at [Niu Jieshi] and pointed to the piece of meat on the wall again. In the afternoon, a person rode a bicycle in circles on the roof of a house in [Niu Street Market]. [Widow Ma] heard neighbors talking while hanging out clothes.
1:5:42|1:5:59|Widow Ma turned her head and hung up the clothes again, but was startled by the person behind her, only to see the blacksmith staring straight at her belly. Widow Ma immediately turned and left, but when she went downstairs, she ran into the demon god who was going upstairs. The demon god walked past Widow Ma with his head held high, then stopped and looked at her belly.
1:5:59|1:6:12|Later, she looked helplessly at [Widow Ma], lifted her skirt, and turned away. Seeing that the demon did not trouble her further, [Widow Ma] stood in place and let out a sigh of relief. That night, [Niu Jieshi] arrived at [Widow Ma]'s house, uncovered the steamer, and took out the buns.
1:6:16|1:6:26|[Doctor Niu] was eating a steamed bun when he caught Widow Ma's evasive gaze. Slowly, he reached out and pulled back a piece of white cloth. Mayor Very Wong sensed something was wrong and walked over. Widow Ma turned her back.
1:6:39|1:6:54|Widow Ma hurriedly used clothes to cover her already bulging belly, but was still seen by Niu Jieshi. Widow Ma sighed, pushed Niu Jieshi sitting on the bed in front of her, and curiously Niu Jieshi walked over to stare at Widow Ma's belly, then squatted in front of her.
1:6:54|1:7:7|Later, [Widow Ma] slowly lifted the sides of her clothes, revealing her swollen belly in front of [Niu Jieshi]. [Niu Jieshi] widened his eyes, looking at the scene before him. He reached out and gently touched the belly, only to see [Widow Ma]'s belly slightly trembling.
1:7:7|1:7:12|Immediately, [Widow Ma] firmly grasped the hand of [Niu Jieshi], and the excited [Niu Jieshi] looked up at [Widow Ma].
1:7:13|1:7:24|[Widow Ma] glanced at [Doctor Niu], then [Doctor Niu] lowered his head to look at her belly, tilted his head, and gently pressed his ear against [Widow Ma]'s belly. Seeing this, [Widow Ma] couldn't help but chuckle.
1:7:24|1:7:36|At this moment, [Doctor Niu] tightly held his stomach, excitement shining in his eyes. However, [Widow Ma] suddenly stopped smiling, closing her eyes tightly as images of the townspeople in cloaks staring at her flashed through her mind.
1:7:37|1:7:43|Some people have desire in their eyes, some have anger, and others have fleeting compassion.
1:7:43|1:7:57|At this moment, lying on the bed, [Widow Ma] pushed away the hand of [Doctor Niu] who was touching her belly. Then, she sat up, picked up the music box next to the bed. [Doctor Niu] looked at [Widow Ma] in confusion, only to see her pointing outside while standing by the bed. Perplexed, [Doctor Niu] asked.
1:7:57|1:8:1|Widow Ma hurriedly walked to the other side and pulled Doctor Niu, who was lying on the bed.
1:8:3|1:8:18|Widow Ma took out the music box given by Niu Jieshi and stuffed it into Niu Jieshi's hand. Holding the music box, Niu Jieshi was puzzled. Widow Ma frowned, pushed Niu Jieshi out the door, and finally slammed the door shut. Niu Jieshi stood outside the door, crying.
1:8:18|1:8:30|After a while, she quickly ran to the temple of the [Mayor], slipped in through a crack, and then locked the temple door from the inside. She then took the key off, hung it around her neck, and slammed the main door shut.
1:8:30|1:8:39|In the early hours of the next day, the sky was densely covered with dark clouds, and the heavy rain fell like beads off a broken string. At this moment, [Niu Jieshi] was huddled up, sitting in front of the ancestral tablet.
1:8:54|1:9:9|[Niu Jieshi] looked out through the crack in the door and saw the young men of the [Mayor] dancing shirtless in the rain. The [Mayor] stood nearby watching. Unable to resist the urge, [Niu Jieshi] took off his own shirt and then squeezed out through the crack in the door.
1:9:22|1:9:34|Wearing only a pair of oversized underpants, [Niu Jieshi] ran into the crowd with his hands raised, shouting and pushing aside a few young men blocking his way. As he ran, he deliberately bumped into others with his body, as if venting his inner anger.
1:9:34|1:9:49|Seeing Niu Jieshi acting so crazy, the young man beside him was very puzzled. But soon, the surrounding young men scattered and fled, leaving Niu Jieshi dancing happily in the rain. Seeing no one around, Niu Jieshi shivered, and when he woke up again, there were already people standing around him.
1:10:14|1:10:32|Soon, [Niu Jieshi] was quickly carried to the home of [Doctor Niu] by the crowd. A strange electric device slowly approached [Niu Jieshi]'s chest, emitting an eerie light. The sound of electricity from the machine entered [Niu Jieshi]'s ears, leaving him bewildered as he lay there. At that moment, [Doctor Niu] opened the door and walked in, then drew back the bed curtain.
1:10:38|1:10:54|Later, he left with a file bag, [Niu Jieshi] and his brothers, along with Widow Ma, kept a close eye on [Doctor Niu]'s every move. They saw [Doctor Niu] sitting on the other side, quietly discussing with the demon and others, holding up the X-ray photo he had just taken.
1:10:54|1:11:3|The demon god frowned as he looked at the light film, [Niu Jieshi] anxiously propped up his neck to look at them, then he couldn't help but cough, and the hand covering his mouth began to tremble.
1:11:4|1:11:21|Following that, he lay on the frame and was carried out. [Niu Jieshi] opened his eyes and looked weakly at the dark walls. As he emerged from the passage, two tears slid down from the corners of his eyes. The clouds in the sky changed in an instant, and soon, [Niu Jieshi] was taken back to the ancestral hall.
1:11:21|1:11:34|They placed [Niu Jieshi] in the center, surrounded by white candles. Then, they walked in a line according to the direction of the candles. [Niu Jieshi] turned his head to look, but his other hand was tied with a string by someone.
1:11:35|1:11:50|He helped himself up with the support and slowly sat up, only to see his father's will in front of him. Looking at the photo, he remembered the day of his father's funeral. His father lay on the coffin board, eyes not closed, with people around whispering softly.
1:12:3|1:12:12|The memory comes to an end here. At this moment, [Doctor Niu] turns around, holding a piece of film and placing it on the projector, with a rustling sound coming from inside.
1:12:40|1:12:58|The Doctor turned his head and looked at Doctor Niu with a blank expression. At that moment, a flash of the doctor performing surgery appeared, and standing in the distance was Doctor Niu holding a pocket watch. The Doctor raised his hands covered in blood, furrowing his brow as he looked at Niu Jieshi. The scene returned to reality, and at that moment, several burly men in cloaks entered from outside.
1:12:58|1:13:4|Soon, they surrounded the [Doctor], who pretended to be calm and stared at [Doctor Niu] sitting not far away.
1:13:9|1:13:15|After speaking, he looked up and signaled to the people around him. The crowd then rushed forward and subdued [Doctor].
1:13:15|1:13:28|In the midst of the struggle, the cloak's hat was also torn apart. But at this moment, the ground began to shake continuously. Everyone temporarily stopped, looking a bit flustered at the dust leaking from the ceiling. However, [Doctor Niu] sat calmly in his chair.
1:13:39|1:13:58|Soon, [Doctor] left Changshou Town and came to live temporarily on the mountain. At this moment, he was bare-chested, washing himself under a small waterfall with a towel, and then drying himself off. Suddenly, there were noises nearby. He grabbed the towel and walked out, only to see a group of people in cloaks lining up and walking towards the distance.
1:14:1|1:14:8|After a while, the figure of [Doctor] squatting on the mountainside appeared in the frame, while the group of people wearing cloaks were walking forward at the foot of the mountain.
1:14:11|1:14:24|Halfway along the road, [Doctor] was attracted by the sound of a horse neighing. He cautiously leaned out and found a mare giving birth at the foot of the mountain. A foal had just been born, its limbs trembling, but it quickly managed to stand up successfully.
1:14:24|1:14:35|At this moment, several young people are guarding around the house on the mountaintop. The group of people in cloaks walked out of the door and lined up to walk down the mountain. [Doctor] stood on the roof and took a quick glance, then immediately turned back.
1:14:36|1:14:55|At this moment, a pair of leather shoes appeared at the skylight. [Doctor] was seen propping his body and jumping directly from the skylight. Hearing the sound behind him, he turned around, bent down to observe the baby in the cradle. Then, [Doctor] reached out his finger and played with the baby's hand.
1:14:55|1:15:5|[Widow Ma] was standing behind him at some point, [Doctor] was startled, and [Widow Ma] also widened her eyes, staring at the stranger in front of her. [Doctor] pursed his lips and then explained to [Widow Ma].
1:15:14|1:15:25|Upon hearing the words of [Doctor], the expression in [Widow Ma]'s eyes instantly turned desolate, replaced by a gaze filled with hatred. At that moment, the scene once again showed the large stone supported by several wooden sticks.
1:15:25|1:15:37|At this moment, in Changshou Town, [Niu Jieshi] is standing by the wall with a few brothers, holding sticks in their hands. The [Doctor] who is leaning against the wall quietly takes a step back, only to see a bicycle on the roof not far away.
1:15:43|1:15:49|The doctor rode his bicycle quickly past, and Niu Jieshi and the others wanted to intercept but were powerless.
1:15:59|1:16:7|After speaking, he fell down from a high stone step, and the person in a cloak beside him looked at him curiously, while the cavalry and the demon god walked past.
1:16:23|1:16:37|Next, a X-ray film appeared on the screen, and a hand slowly put it down, only to see [Mayor] lying on the bed with an IV drip. Upon hearing what the [Doctor] said, [Mayor] fell into a reverie.
1:16:43|1:16:52|The scene cuts back to the arm wrestling match, revealing a stone hanging under the child's elbow. Below the table, a fat man pulls the pendulum with the tied string forcefully.
1:17:2|1:17:9|Only [Niu Jieshi] passed out on the spot because he drank strong liquor.
1:17:37|1:17:50|The young men taking a bath in the hot water are not the same group, but take turns coming into the icy water. A group of women in the corridor hold towels and hot tea, receiving the shivering young men.
1:17:50|1:18:5|However, at this moment, the gate of the ancestral hall remained tightly closed. From a distance, the [Mayor] saw that [Niu Jieshi] had not yet emerged. Ignoring the midwife's obstruction, he took off his own clothes and walked into the crowd. Seeing the [Mayor] standing in the rain with his arms raised, [Niu Jieshi] then quickly took off his outer garment and ran out.
1:18:23|1:18:30|After speaking, the [Mayor] stared at the ceiling beam, the [Doctor] turned to look, and then took a few steps towards the inner room. It turned out that the jug was hidden behind the glass on the ceiling beam.
1:18:46|1:18:57|[Doctor] held the wine pot in his hand, looking around. [Mayor] took out the hidden wine cup behind the pillow, then trembled as he raised it. He smiled when he saw it, and then poured a cup for [Mayor].
1:19:13|1:19:17|The scene cuts to [Mayor] grabbing the wine jug lifted by the old man.
1:19:39|1:19:47|Niu Jieshi remembered sneaking a drink when he was young, only to be scolded by [Widow Ma]. Now seeing [Widow Ma] so happy drinking, he couldn't help but join in the fun.
1:20:1|1:20:9|The [Widow Ma], kept in captivity, constantly tries to break free. Niu Jieshi takes away Banxian's horse in order to set it free, and also to have the mare mate with the stallion!
1:20:32|1:20:49|[Niu Jieshi] found the locked-up teenager and then took out the key to unlock the chain. At this moment, [Doctor] picked up a wine glass, smiled and clinked glasses with [Mayor], then the two of them raised their glasses and drank it all. Meanwhile, there was a scene of [Widow Ma] holding a blood transfusion tube, and [Niu Jieshi] lay beside with a cut on his head.
1:20:57|1:21:2|Later, the scene cuts to the day when Niu Jieshi is going to the wedding banquet, Widow Ma stands in the corner, grabs him, and tells him not to go.
1:21:21|1:21:25|Widow Ma made Niu Jieshi leave that night, and the blacksmith kept watch on the two from the skylight.
1:21:32|1:21:49|[Widow Ma] covered her mouth and turned her head. As [Widow Ma] turned around, tears welled up in her eyes. She walked into the market of [Niu Jieshi] and raised her hand as if to touch her face, but then pushed her away. Seeing that [Niu Jieshi] didn't want to leave the market, [Widow Ma] knelt down in front of her directly.
1:21:49|1:21:54|[Niu Jieshi] Street Market paused for a moment, then [Widow Ma] looked up at [Niu Jieshi] Street Market and slowly closed the door.
1:21:55|1:22:21|More and more things became unclear to him, [Niu Jieshi] couldn't find a way to vent his emotions in the market. He rode his bicycle, lifted his head, and circled around the roof of the ancestral hall, the sky above his head spinning along with his eyes. Then, the scene shifted to [Mayor] lying on the bed, reaching out his hand to pull [Doctor] towards him.
1:22:21|1:22:23|[Doctor] turned to look at [Mayor] and grinned.
1:22:25|1:22:40|The Doctor said no more. He straightened up, turned his back and walked to the door frame. He raised his hand to look around, then leaned his body against the door and turned his head to smile at the Mayor lying on the bed, who turned his head silently and spoke.
1:22:50|1:23:6|[Mayor] pondered for a moment, slowly opened his eyes and looked out the window. At that moment, the face of [Niu Jieshi] in the street market appeared on the screen. He lay on the bed with a smile, reminiscing about the day when aphrodisiac powder was sprinkled from upstream. At that time, bubbles of various sizes floated in the alleys of Changshou Town.
1:23:6|1:23:23|Everyone walked out of the house with happy smiles on their faces. Some tried to catch the floating bubbles with their hands, while others, ignoring the gaze of others, embraced tightly. [Painter] and the demon stood on the swing, close together, constantly blowing bubbles with their mouths.
1:23:23|1:23:40|Everyone looked up, enjoying this unbridled beauty. As an outsider, [Niu Jieshi] stood in the aisle, puzzled by the unusual evidence of love that even the butcher, Mr. Niu, had found for himself, while everyone else was immersed in this rare romance.
1:23:40|1:23:54|People no longer fear [Niu Jieshi] as they used to, even showing him gentle smiles. [Niu Jieshi] opens his mouth, looking incredulous, frowning as he gazes at the bubbles around him, deeply suspicious of the different attitude others have towards him.
1:23:54|1:24:11|The scene cuts back to reality, where [Niu Jieshi] is lying quietly in the coffin. The young boy places the stethoscope on his heart, but hears no sound. The Doctor smiles, picks up the stethoscope, and places it on the boy's chest. Hearing the heartbeat coming from inside, the boy smiles happily.
1:24:11|1:24:19|The doctor then placed the music box that had always been with Niu Jieshi next to him into the coffin, and then picked up a stone slab to cover his entire body.
1:24:20|1:24:33|The scene cuts to [Doctor Niu]'s room, where he takes out the piece of meat given to him by the cattle boss, slices it thinly, and then eats it. At that moment, the Doctor walks over and turns off the music-playing phonograph.
1:24:52|1:25:1|The doctor smelled the meat, put down the bowl, turned his head and smiled at Doctor Niu.
1:26:1|1:26:14|The doctor turned and smiled at [Doctor Niu]. At that moment, the scene shifted to a baby's smile. Widow Ma, standing in the doorway, took a step back in fright, watching the doctor crouched on the ground.
1:26:14|1:26:22|[Widow Ma] raised her finger and pointed outside, not daring to make a sound. At this moment, [Doctor Niu] appeared in the scene, holding a bag of medicine and angrily questioning everyone.
1:26:27|1:26:33|[Mayor] and Widow Ma sat on the side without saying a word. Doctor Niu walked down the stairs with a medicine bag, looking at the crowd standing below.
1:27:10|1:27:19|[Doctor Niu] angrily threw away the medicine bag, the young man quietly squeezed into the crowd, and then immediately ran away. [Doctor Niu] went upstairs and pointed at the people outside wearing cloaks.
1:27:32|1:27:38|The painter on the rooftop was startled by the crazed Doctor Niu, who then turned around and knelt before the Mayor.
1:27:48|1:28:4|At this moment, Widow Ma, hidden in the crowd, pulled down the cloak's hood, lifted her head, stared resentfully at Doctor Niu kneeling on the ground, and then walked slowly to the other side. People standing by tried to stop her, but seeing the fierce look in Widow Ma's eyes, they silently stepped aside.
1:28:4|1:28:19|Widow Ma then turned to look around, her expressionless face scrutinizing everyone involved. She then walked to the center, hands cradling her belly. Doctor Niu stood up from the ground, looking down at the scene below. Widow Ma also looked up, staring straight at the instigator in front of her.
1:28:19|1:28:26|Immediately, he picked up the bag of medicine that had been thrown underneath. At this moment, the young man, panting heavily, ran into the ancestral hall where [Niu Jieshi] lived.
1:28:47|1:28:58|[Doctor Niu] was stunned for a moment, then immediately grabbed a knife and rushed over, with the young man closely following by his side.
1:28:58|1:29:17|Upon hearing the news, the crowd immediately scattered. Before long, a big knife pierced through the curtain, and the fool inside pointed outside. Then, [Niu Jieshi] appeared in the corridor, carrying a big knife, followed by a young man and a group of children holding sticks or kitchen utensils, shouting incessantly.
1:29:17|1:29:31|[Niu Jieshi] looked around and then saw a big knife chopping directly at a wooden door. He then kicked the door open with one leg, leading the children inside. The leading child rushed in and started throwing things around in [Doctor Niu]'s medicine box.
1:29:31|1:29:46|Other children following behind picked up things in Doctor Niu's house and threw them directly to the ground. Niu Jieshi pulled aside the curtain and walked in. He looked at the things inside, furious, he immediately waved the big knife in his hand and smashed the glass cabinet next to him into pieces.
1:29:46|1:29:57|At this moment, the fool shouted loudly while holding up a framed X-ray, "Key, key." [Niu Jieshi] heard it and walked out, taking the X-ray from the fool's hand and examining it carefully.
1:29:57|1:30:12|The fool standing behind walked over, pointed to the shadow of the key, then picked up the key around [Niu Jieshi]'s neck and compared it, finding them identical. It was not until then that [Niu Jieshi] suddenly realized that on the day when [Doctor Niu] examined him, his key was right in front of his chest.
1:30:12|1:30:18|After learning the truth, [Niu Jieshi] felt both wronged and angry, but his eyes became even more fierce.
1:30:54|1:31:3|[Widow Ma] stared straight at [Niu Jieshi], only to see [Niu Jieshi]'s face contort into a grimace, reaching out to slap [Widow Ma] across the face.
1:31:3|1:31:16|Unyielding [Niu Jieshi] picked up the jar ready to strike at [Widow Ma], but saw tears in her eyes as she stared back. Tears welled up in [Niu Jieshi]'s eyes too, her lips trembling with anger, yet she did not put down the jar.
1:31:16|1:31:24|[Widow Ma] turned around, leaning on the stairs, heard the sound of a bell, [Niu Jieshi] pushed [Widow Ma] up the stairs, walked to the roof, only to see her kick open the door, shouting loudly.
1:31:33|1:31:47|[Niu Jieshi] roared like a wild beast in anger, but soon he returned to Widow Ma's house, only to find it empty. He went downstairs and searched around, but there was still no sign of anyone inside. [Niu Jieshi] became so anxious that he started pacing back and forth, as if on the verge of tears.
1:31:48|1:32:0|A pair of hands appeared on the railing of the second floor, [Niu Jieshi] looked up and saw [Widow Ma] sitting there quietly watching him. He looked at [Niu Jieshi] with a gentle smile, then gestured with his hands.
1:32:1|1:32:13|[Niu Jieshi] looked up at him with a furrowed brow, his eyes filled with heartache and reluctance. [Widow Ma] watched him, shaking her head sadly, only to see [Niu Jieshi] take a few quick steps, preparing to go upstairs. Seeing this, [Widow Ma] immediately clung to the railing, intending to jump down.
1:33:6|1:33:19|Following that, he bit open the abortion pills in his hand, [Widow Ma] stared at him with wide eyes, [Niu Jieshi] cried as he tore the pills into pieces and stuffed them directly into his mouth. His hands trembled in fear, tears swirling in his eyes.
1:34:17|1:34:29|Back at the ancestral hall, [Niu Jieshi] burns the X-ray film in the stove. He sits quietly in front of the deity, staring into the distance. At this moment, [Niu Jieshi]'s face becomes extremely haggard, and his lips turn pale and shriveled.
1:34:29|1:34:42|Early the next morning, a few rays of sunlight shone through the cracks in the door, [Niu Jieshi] still sat motionless in place, the fire in the iron basin had already extinguished, the entire Changshou Town was still as quiet as usual, with no one in the alley.
1:34:42|1:34:55|At this moment, the scene shows [Widow Ma] clutching her stomach, writhing in pain on the bed, her sweat soaking her hair. In a daze, she feels a hand on her belly, and she immediately sits up and looks back, only to find no one behind her.
1:34:56|1:35:12|[Niu Jieshi] looked at the coffin behind him, then turned around, his eyes turning a steely blue. He looked helplessly into the distance and let out a deep sigh. Soon after, [Niu Jieshi] walked out from inside, locked the door of the ancestral hall, and then hung the key around his neck. His hair was disheveled, and his eye sockets were deeply sunken.
1:35:12|1:35:19|[Niu Jieshi] opened his mouth as if to say something, then slung a piece of cloth diagonally across his body and looked around.
1:35:31|1:35:43|The empty courtyard echoed with silence, [Niu Jieshi] smiled bitterly, dragging the simple coffin and taking each step forward with great effort. After a while, he placed a jar and glasses on the stone steps.
1:35:50|1:35:58|[Niu Jieshi] looked at the tightly closed door, lowered his head in disappointment. But after he left, the old man in the house quietly opened the wooden door.
1:36:14|1:36:21|After speaking, he looked up at the window upstairs, then slowly lowered his head, pulled the coffin made by [Painter], and walked forward again.
1:36:27|1:36:44|[Niu Jieshi] dragged his coffin board, carrying things he had stolen before, and went door to door to deliver them to every household. However, he did not receive any response. People always waited until [Niu Jieshi] left before coming out of their houses, quietly watching his departing figure.
1:36:44|1:36:53|[Niu Jieshi] understood that the people in the town didn't like him, so without any greetings, he quietly placed those things at the door, then left with the coffin board.
1:36:53|1:37:3|Inwardly desperate, [Niu Jieshi] quickly arrived at the exit of Changshou Town with his head down. At this moment, he was pulling the heavy coffin board with all his might, but his body seemed to have been drained of strength.
1:37:4|1:37:18|[Niu Jieshi] felt like every step was walking on nails, the pain piercing his heart. At this moment, he had not yet noticed a group of people following behind him. [Niu Jieshi] faintly heard the murmurs, standing still with his back turned, afraid to look back.
1:37:18|1:37:29|After a while, he made up his mind, took a deep breath, slowly turned around, only to find everyone standing behind him silently looking at him. [Niu Jieshi] looked at everyone in front of him, and saw their throats move slightly.
1:37:31|1:37:45|Afterwards, he swallowed again, nodded silently, stopped bending down, and knelt directly on the ground.
1:37:45|1:38:6|In the kingdom of Valour, [Niu Jieshi] looked at everyone in front of him with pleading eyes, then slowly reached out his hands and placed them on the uneven stone road. He then banged his head heavily on the ground, only to hear a burst of women's crying in the crowd. The woman standing opposite him pursed her lips, tears shimmering in her eyes.
1:38:6|1:38:10|[Niu Jieshi] looked up at everyone, then bowed his head again and knocked it on the ground.
1:38:12|1:38:23|At this moment, as the sound of crying in the crowd grew louder, [Niu Jieshi] got up from the ground. He pursed his dry, white lips and furrowed his brow, almost pleadingly looking at everyone standing in front of him.
1:38:27|1:38:42|[Niu Jieshi] finished speaking with trembling lips, then he stood up unsteadily, supporting himself with his hands on the ground. He couldn't bear to look at the place where he had once lived and the neighbors he had teased before. After pausing for a moment, he waved his hand as if nothing had happened.
1:38:46|1:39:1|After speaking, [Niu Jieshi] turned his head, afraid of revealing the vulnerability in his heart. A ray of morning sun fell on his head, but still could not conceal the gloom on him. His eyes firmly held onto something as he walked away, but his legs uncontrollably wanted to collapse.
1:39:1|1:39:13|After just a few short steps, it seemed as if all his strength had been drained. Before long, [Niu Jieshi] had already dragged the coffin to halfway up the mountain. Suddenly, the sound of a baby crying echoed through Changshou Town.
1:39:14|1:39:24|He suddenly stopped in his tracks and looked in the familiar direction. He gazed for a long time, but soon he turned around, shouldered the coffin board, and continued walking up the mountain.
1:39:29|1:39:43|The scene cuts to the face of [Doctor Niu]. He looks shocked, with a trickle of blood slowly running down his nose. He sticks out his tongue and licks it, then starts to panic. Quickly, he removes his gloves and covers his nose with his hand.
1:39:43|1:39:51|He used his hand to staunch the continuously flowing nosebleed, tears mixed with blood streaming down his face.
1:40:10|1:40:21|A few days later, the [Doctor] once again came to the home of [Widow Ma]. He stood on the roof, secretly watching the cloaked figure leaving, only to see at the end of the line someone carrying a basket turning around, and that person was [Widow Ma].
1:40:21|1:40:26|He looked at [Doctor], made a thank-you gesture with his hand, then immediately turned around and followed at the end of the line.
1:40:27|1:40:42|The fulfilled [Doctor] lay on the bed with a satisfied smile. At this moment, the scene shifted to the day when [Niu Jieshi] left the town market carrying the inner coffin to a recessed cliff bottom. He was panting heavily, his lips already turning pale.
1:40:42|1:40:58|Following that, he tidied up his clothes a bit, the dryness in his throat made [Niu Jieshi] involuntarily lick his lips. After a while, he struggled to climb into the coffin, stubbornly glancing in the direction of Longevity Town. Then, he took out the music box he had once given to [Widow Ma].
1:40:58|1:41:3|[Niu Jieshi] blew off the dust on top and then placed it on his own coffin.
1:41:3|1:41:17|Accompanied by music and sounds, he slightly opened his eyes and gazed blankly at the sky. The camera followed the direction of [Niu Jieshi]'s gaze, gradually passing through the branches on the cliff, the clear sky above his head, which at this moment also turned into a vast ocean.
1:41:17|1:41:27|[Niu Jieshi] imagined himself as a little fish at the bottom of the sea. Unwilling to swim with the school of fish, he quietly swam in the opposite direction, determined to carve out his own world.
1:41:28|1:41:43|At this moment, with the yellow dust filling the screen, a motorcycle is speeding away into the distance. [Widow Ma], wearing a cloak, gets off the motorcycle and takes off her hat, letting out a sigh of relief. The driver of the motorcycle beside her looks at her and smiles, and then [Widow Ma] also smiles happily.
1:41:43|1:41:49|Afterwards, she turned around, picked up the child, and silently walked towards the distance. When she left, the motorcycle driver also turned around and left.
1:41:50|1:42:4|At this moment, the screen once again shows the smiling face of [Doctor]. [Niu Jieshi] seems to have also seen the image of [Widow Ma] holding the child, lying in the coffin with a content smile. [Widow Ma], who has successfully left, smiles from the heart as she holds the child in her arms.
1:42:4|1:42:20|In the glow of the setting sun, she stood up straight, looking ahead, and took slow steps forward. [Widow Ma] held her head high, savoring the hard-earned freedom. Her eyes became determined, then she gently cradled the baby's head and resolutely walked towards the unrestrained distance.
1:42:20|1:42:35|A few days later, the [Doctor] returned to the place where [Niu Jieshi] was buried. By now, the cliff was covered with flowers. Smiling, the [Doctor] turned around and looked at Changshou Town at the foot of the mountain, then looked up at the mountaintop, where an old kite was hanging from a tree branch.
1:42:35|1:42:42|He whistled towards the sky, the echo reverberated in the valley, but not long after, the melody of the music box could be heard.
1:42:43|1:42:55|The Doctor turned his head and looked at the grave of Niu Jieshi, which was covered with bananas and apples. Then, he looked back at Changshou Town at the foot of the mountain, his face expressionless but his eyes as cold as an ice cellar.
1:42:55|1:43:4|In the town of Changshou, a group of people wearing black cloaks are lined up for a ceremony. The person lying on the wooden boat this time is the [Mayor], with people in front of him holding school canes.
1:43:5|1:43:15|Suddenly, the crowd behind, dressed in cloaks, stopped and looked up, shouting loudly towards the sky. Someone opened their mouth wide, with a fierce expression, screaming at the sky with all their might.
1:43:15|1:43:29|The [Doctor] stood quietly on the top of the mountain, watching them. Suddenly, a large rock from a distant hilltop fell, causing a rumbling sound from the mountain. Soon, rocks of all sizes rolled down the slope rapidly.
1:43:30|1:43:44|The wooden stakes supporting the giant rock are gradually unable to hold up. At this moment, the huge rock at the top has slid to the edge of falling, and the inside stakes are bearing increasing weight until they can no longer support and break, with only the outer stakes still holding strong.
1:43:44|1:43:55|Before long, the aged boulder rolled forward again, shattering the wooden beam underneath into pieces. Unable to hold on any longer, it finally plummeted from the mountain towards this ancient town.
