0:1:56|0:2:31|At this moment, a handsome man and a beautiful woman are flirting in a high-end restaurant. The man politely takes the menu from the waiter and flips through a few pages skillfully. He closes the menu, looks at the girl across from him with concern, while the girl rests her chin on her hand, nodding admiringly.
0:2:35|0:2:44|The man evenly sprinkled pepper into the soup, then carefully added a few drops of fish sauce, while the girl still propped up her chin, looking at the man with a smile.
0:2:47|0:2:49|The man smiled and scooped a spoonful of soup, handing it to her.
0:2:54|0:3:13|After the girl took a sip, the man took back the spoon and finished the rest of the soup. Then, they drove on the road, with the girl sitting in the passenger seat, leaning easily on the man's shoulder. When the man's hand skillfully moved towards the girl's thigh, the girl did not dodge, and even shyly nestled into the man's arms.
0:3:13|0:3:23|At this moment, as the red light came on and the vehicles stopped at the intersection, the two of them took the opportunity to embrace and kiss as if no one else was around. Suddenly, the screeching sound of brakes filled the air, prompting the man to curiously stick his head out.
0:3:25|0:3:45|Not far away, a crowd of people formed a circle. The man regained consciousness and drove forward. Inside the circle surrounded by the pedestrians, vegetables were scattered on the ground, a catfish fell out of a plastic bag, emitting a silent gasp. The women lying on the ground inside the circle had their simple skirts soaked through with blood.
0:3:45|0:3:53|At this moment, Chen Jiaqiao and Yanzi arrived at a temple on the mountain. Yanzi held three incense sticks in her hand, raised them to her forehead, and devoutly kowtowed with her eyes closed.
0:4:25|0:4:43|The girl still couldn't find the figure of [Chen Jiaqiao] in the temple. She shook her arms in frustration and left the temple helplessly. The girl's hand holding the phone slipped weakly, gazing sadly at the night outside the window.
0:4:45|0:4:53|Late at night, the girl in a flight attendant uniform hurriedly pulls a suitcase and rushes out of the departure hall. After exiting, she anxiously looks around.
0:5:7|0:5:17|At this moment, [Chen Jiaqiao] mischievously crouched down and quietly hid behind the girl. As the girl anxiously searched for him, he suddenly embraced her and passionately kissed her.
0:5:19|0:5:37|On the way home, the girl clung to [Chen Jiaqiao] tightly like a bear, occasionally leaning towards his cheek. [Chen Jiaqiao] held the steering wheel without looking, but easily brushed against her lips in response. Soon, the door was opened, and [Chen Jiaqiao] covered the girl's eyes with one hand, leading her inside.
0:5:42|0:6:5|After stopping, [Chen Jiaqiao] smiled and put down his hand. He saw the girl with a hat on her head inside the house, her eyes widening with joy as she curiously looked into each room. She turned around, sweetly kissed [Chen Jiaqiao], and mischievously put her empty hat on his face, then bounced over to open the balcony French window.
0:6:5|0:6:9|The man affectionately kissed the girl's cheek and then took out a property deed from his pocket.
0:6:13|0:6:18|The girl who saw the property deed was stunned, and after a long time, she looked up at [Luo Yi].
0:6:49|0:6:59|The man helplessly pinched the chin of the girl with a pouting face full of grievances. Late at night, the girl was immersed in a dream, letting out a sigh of unease.
0:7:0|0:7:15|In the blink of an eye, another late night arrives. The [Flight Attendants] walk out of the airport lobby in groups, pulling their suitcases. One flight attendant's boyfriend considerately carries her suitcase and helps her into the car, while the other staff members chat and laugh as they walk outside.
0:7:16|0:7:30|The girl stood alone at the door of the hall, holding her suitcase without moving. Obviously, the man did not come to pick her up this time. Just as she lowered her head to leave alone, the [air hostess] who had been taken away by her boyfriend returned.
0:7:34|0:8:1|[COCO] raised the wine glass and drank it all in one gulp. [COCO] raised the wine glass and drank it all in one gulp. [COCO] raised the wine glass and drank it all in one gulp. [COCO] raised the wine glass and drank it all in one gulp.
0:8:18|0:8:35|At this moment, [COCO] was already half drunk, excitedly raising the wine glass again and taking a sip. In the early morning, the door of [COCO]'s room was opened, and someone walked in tiptoe. However, all this did not wake up the hungover [COCO]. The first chapter of the film, setting the stage.
0:8:35|0:8:45|At this moment, [COCO] is still sound asleep, looking pure and peaceful. The person who came in seems reluctant to wake him up, half kneeling on the ground, picking up the scattered clothes of [COCO] one by one.
0:9:20|0:9:36|[Chen Jiaqiao] did not respond, just kept kissing [COCO]'s forehead. [Chen Jiaqiao] remained silent, easily leaned in towards [COCO], only to be impatiently avoided by the other party.
0:9:40|0:9:52|[Chen Jiaqiao] turned around wearily, silently placing his hand over his eyes. The next moment, [COCO] entered the kitchen, clumsily cracking eggs into the pot and haphazardly sprinkling seasonings inside, showing extreme lack of skill.
0:9:53|0:10:5|[Chen Jiaqiao] was lying on the sofa in the living room. When he heard the phone ringing, he looked very annoyed. Eventually, he took out his phone from his pocket, glanced at the caller ID, and then threw it onto the coffee table.
0:10:5|0:10:12|On the screen, the words "Yanzi calling" appeared. On the other side, COCO walked out of the kitchen with a freshly cooked instant noodle, smiling.
0:10:31|0:10:51|Please like, subscribe, share, and support the Mingjing and Diandian programs. [COCO] was about to step forward to check the incoming call display when suddenly enraged, [Chen Jiaqiao] scared her. [Chen Jiaqiao] slammed her face to the ground, grabbed the phone on the table without hesitation, and shook off [COCO]'s hand and left.
0:10:51|0:11:6|[COCO] was left sobbing helplessly. After a while, [COCO] knelt on the ground, slowly wiping the water with a towel and brush. However, with each wipe, she couldn't help but recall the scene just now, and she broke down, lowering her head.
0:11:6|0:11:26|Suddenly, the sound outside the door caught the attention of [COCO]. However, when she looked up, she saw nothing. [COCO] lowered her eyes and vigorously wiped the floor again. Yet, the unidentified noise outside the house once again drew her attention. This time, when she looked up again, she still didn't see anything unusual.
0:11:33|0:11:47|[COCO] hurriedly walked towards the door, not seeing the figure of [Chen Jiaqiao]. Just as she turned back disappointedly, she was startled by the sudden appearance of a woman. [COCO] gave a perfunctory smile and was about to close the door.
0:12:7|0:12:24|The woman's pleading made [COCO] unable to refuse, so she let her in. Once inside, the woman placed the thermos on the table, took a few steps forward casually. She then turned her head to illuminate the bedroom for a moment, and casually observed the furnishings in the living room.
0:12:34|0:12:48|The woman knelt down on the ground without saying a word, skillfully wiping the floor with a rag. [COCO] awkwardly squatted on the side, only able to clean the floor with detergent. Suddenly, the woman stopped and picked up a photo of [COCO] and herself.
0:12:54|0:12:59|[COCO] furrowed her brow, took the photo frame from the woman's hand and placed it on the table, then continued to scrub the floor with her head down.
0:13:2|0:13:18|[COCO] said nothing, but her eyes were red and her lips tightly pressed together, conveying everything. The woman took out a tissue from her bag and gently wiped away [COCO]'s tears.
0:13:23|0:13:27|In the next second, [COCO] was holding a woman's thermos, drinking the soup heartily.
0:14:5|0:14:9|The woman slowly straightened up and approached [COCO].
0:14:55|0:15:12|Gu Xiaofan and [COCO] hit it off at first sight, and even went shopping together. [COCO] handed Gu Xiaofan a floral plate. Gu Xiaofan shook his head, put the plate back on the shelf, but [COCO] seemed reluctant and picked it up again.
0:15:21|0:15:34|[COCO] finally placed the flower plate back on the shelf. That day, [Chen Jiaqiao] parked the car in front of the airport departure hall, anxiously looking around.
0:15:35|0:15:48|Upon seeing [COCO] coming out, he immediately honked the horn, but [COCO] ignored him and continued to walk forward with the suitcase. Chen Jiaqiao quickly stopped the car, reaching out his hands to block [COCO]'s path.
0:16:0|0:16:19|[COCO] may have frowned, but the smile on her face couldn't be hidden. As soon as they entered the house, they couldn't contain their passion and embraced each other. She threw away the hat in her hand and kept rubbing Chen Jiaqiao's face, expressing her longing. Suddenly, [COCO] seemed to remember something and pushed Chen Jiaqiao away.
0:16:23|0:16:29|[COCO] pecked Chen Jiaqiao's lips like a dragonfly touching the water, then hurriedly slipped to the side and clumsily put on high heels.
0:16:44|0:17:3|[Coco], under the guidance of [Chen Jiaqiao], went to the supermarket and bought two large bags of ingredients. Excitedly, she ran back home and rushed into the kitchen while [Yanzi] was taking a shower. [Coco] tied on an apron, took out some bowls and plates from the cupboard, grabbed the cutting board from the table, and headed outside to the sink.
0:17:3|0:17:9|She returned to the kitchen again. She took out the colander, quickly washed the vegetables clean, and took them out.
0:17:9|0:17:26|For the first time, [COCO] cooked a meal seriously for her boyfriend, [Chen Jiaqiao], which made her both excited and nervous. She skillfully cut the onions into large pieces, prepared a series of seasonings such as ginger and garlic, carried the seasoning bowl back to the kitchen, closed the kitchen door tightly, and quietly dialed a phone number on her phone.
0:17:35|0:17:40|COCO blushed and pushed Chen Jiaqiao out of the kitchen, then closed the door again.
0:17:42|0:17:55|[Jiaqiao] was like a mischievous child, standing sneakily outside the kitchen with a necklace in hand. Just as [COCO] was in a flurry, he slipped into the kitchen, wrapped his arms around [COCO], and carefully put the necklace on for her.
0:18:3|0:18:32|[COCO] kissed [Chen Jiaqiao] to comfort him, then playfully pushed him out of the kitchen again. [COCO] was in a rush and accidentally cut herself several times with the oil splattering. The thick soup in the clay pot was about to overflow. After lifting the lid, the lamb soup stewed in burnt sauce looked appetizing.
0:18:32|0:18:49|At the dining table, [Chen Jiaqiao] picked up the clay pot and drank all the soup inside without leaving a drop, then looked at [COCO] playfully. Shaking her head, [Chen Jiaqiao] nuzzled against [COCO]'s chest, then lifted [COCO] up with one hand, keeping his legs around her waist.
0:18:50|0:19:9|[COCO] lay gracefully with her slender waist, and [Chen Jiaqiao] effortlessly carried her into the bedroom, kissing each other along the way, filling the room with the scent of shadows. The first dish [Chen Jiaqiao] ate was called Pepper Sauce Lamb Chops, not only delicious but also with the effect of invigorating yang and enhancing desire.
0:19:9|0:19:18|Jiaqiao placed [COCO] on the bed and quickly took off his own clothes. As they enjoyed themselves, Jiaqiao's phone rang again.
0:19:20|0:19:40|At the same time, a strange woman hung up the unanswered phone call. The next day, in a bustling teahouse, a woman skillfully brewed the tea in front of her. Then, she lifted the teapot, lifted and lowered the water three times, repeating the process, it was the memory of the three nods of the Phoenix.
0:19:40|0:19:44|The one making tea is [Gu Xiaofan], and she takes out a handbag and hands it to [Coco].
0:19:59|0:20:16|At the persuasion of [Gu Xiaofan], [COCO] came to the bathroom with her to change into a new dress. The dark suspender dress set off [COCO]'s skin even whiter, and she turned satisfactorily in front of the mirror. [Gu Xiaofan] had one hand on [COCO]'s chest and the other arm around her shoulder.
0:20:27|0:20:33|Since then, [COCO]'s first action upon returning home was to turn on the gas stove and cook a delicious dish according to the recipe.
0:21:27|0:21:39|[COCO] What COCO didn't know was that the unfamiliar woman was holding a pot of soup, bearing a striking resemblance to Gu Xiaofan. In the end, [COCO] failed to realize that home was where she belonged, and fell asleep on the dining table.
0:21:39|0:21:50|Returning home late, [Chen Jiaqiao] tiptoed over and took a look at the sleepy [COCO], then started to enjoy the feast in front of her heartily. [Chen Jiaqiao] took a big bite of a spoonful of warm flowers and stuffed it into her mouth.
0:21:51|0:22:2|COCO nodded contentedly, the crisp sound of dishes and chopsticks clashing in front of him woke up his sleepy [Coco]. Seeing his boyfriend eating heartily in front of him, he happily smiled.
0:22:15|0:22:33|At this moment, [Yanzi]'s home remains quiet and silent, with only a lamp still on the console table. The soft light shines on the boiling hotpot. In the middle of the night, Jiaqiao seems to be awakened by the thunder, picking up a glass of water and drinking it quickly, while [COCO] remains sound asleep.
0:22:33|0:22:47|One day, [COCO] was tidying up the dishes and suddenly his phone vibrated, causing him to stop. After touching the coat draped over the chair, [COCO] confirmed it was coming from the pocket and carefully took out the phone.
0:22:48|0:23:10|He glanced at the caller ID, then looked back at [Chen Jiaqiao] who was sound asleep before answering the phone. The other party not only did not respond, but also hung up the phone. Curious, [COCO] glanced at [Chen Jiaqiao] and then redialed the number.
0:23:10|0:23:17|The lonely phone rings in the empty room, but no one answers it. Helpless [COCO] has to hang up the phone.
0:23:23|0:23:36|Just off work, [COCO] didn't have time to change into her flight attendant uniform, so she hurriedly made an appointment with [Chen Jiaqiao] to pick up the food box. This is the third dish prepared for [Yanzi] - steamed hairy crabs. The meat of the hairy crab is fat and delicious, nourishing the channels and solidifying the essence, clearing heat and detoxifying.
0:23:36|0:23:41|[COCO] quickly took out the delicious food from the lunch box and placed it on the plate, then hurriedly hid the lunch box in the cupboard.
0:23:57|0:24:15|That day, the two of them were playing doubles tennis in the gym. [COCO] and [Chen Jiaqiao] cooperated very well, and soon they were shouting with excitement. [Chen Jiaqiao] saw [COCO] playing seriously, and playfully used the racket to pat [COCO]'s buttocks. Suddenly, [Chen Jiaqiao] changed his expression, trembling as he squatted down.
0:24:28|0:24:55|Chen Jiaqiao raised his head in pain, for a moment not knowing where he was, feeling dizzy. [COCO] suddenly realized something was wrong and quickly hugged him. [COCO] was about to answer the phone, but was stopped by Chen Jiaqiao frowning.
0:25:5|0:25:25|Jiaqiao originally wanted to comfort [COCO] with a kiss, but was avoided by the other party. Jiaqiao did not insist, picked up the tennis bag and walked towards the door, leaving [COCO] alone. And [COCO] was like a little girl, soon throwing negative emotions behind her, happily going to the supermarket with Gu Xiaofan.
0:25:25|0:25:31|Gu Xiaofan pointed at the fish in the water tank, smiling meaningfully. When he got home, the fish, jumping around wildly, leaped onto the floor.
0:25:32|0:25:51|[COCO] was so scared that she jumped up and almost fell down. Chen Jiaqiao was on the ground desperately grabbing, and the two of them laughed heartily. Chen Jiaqiao looked like a skilled cook, cutting the shredded potatoes quickly and evenly, carefully removing the seeds from the lantern glue, and even cutting the green onions into different shapes according to their different uses.
0:25:51|0:26:11|After seasoning the fish, Gu Xiaofan skillfully cut it into beautiful flower shapes, then evenly spread the beaten egg mixture on the fish. When the oil in the pan reached a certain temperature, she slid the fish in along the edge of the pan. This is the fourth dish, Toothed Catfish with Abalone, sweet in taste and warm in nature, nourishing the middle and benefiting yang.
0:26:13|0:26:18|[COCO] immediately dropped the kitchen utensils and ran out of the kitchen with a big smile on her face.
0:26:32|0:26:42|In the gap while waiting for the elevator, the two of them kissed as if no one else was around, while at home, Gu Xiaofan calmly poured the fermented black beans all over his body and neatly placed them on the dining table. After entering the elevator,
0:26:54|0:27:8|At the same time, Gu Xiaofan calmly tidied up the dining table, even pouring two glasses of white wine, looking every bit like a hostess. Jiaqiao and [COCO] passionately kissed, until the elevator arrival alert stopped their passion.
0:27:8|0:27:15|[COCO] took the lead out of the elevator, tossing her hair back seductively and effortlessly putting the glasses back on [Chen Jiaqiao].
0:27:28|0:27:39|[COCO] excitedly ducked into the kitchen, only to find that [Chen Jiaqiao] was nowhere to be seen. She picked up an apron, pouted, and couldn't help but dial the phone.
0:28:1|0:28:13|[COCO] hung up the phone with a smile, seemingly remembering something joyful, and left a message as she emerged from the kitchen. Meanwhile, [Chen Jiaqiao] walked out of the elevator with a cold expression, completely different from her usual gentle smile.
0:28:17|0:28:24|Chen Jiaqiao immediately lifted the heavy oven and walked towards the kitchen. Unexpectedly, as soon as he entered the kitchen door, an accident occurred.
0:28:34|0:28:45|Later, Chen Jiaqiao was taken to the hospital and underwent various tests with all kinds of instruments. From CT scans to MRIs, every possible area that could be examined was thoroughly checked.
0:29:8|0:29:19|[COCO] carefully studied the recipe, occasionally lifting the lid to check the status of the stew.
0:29:22|0:29:36|Chen Jiaqiao rubbed his eyes listlessly, looking like he couldn't wake up. COCO brought the soup to his front, affectionately kissed his forehead, but Chen Jiaqiao only took two sips, frowned, and absentmindedly took out the chopsticks from his mouth.
0:29:38|0:29:48|[COCO] approached in confusion, with a few broken hairs floating on the tip of the spoon. He looked back at [Chen Jiaqiao] in shock in an instant.
0:29:51|0:30:6|[Jiaqiao] touched his eyebrows, only to find that they easily fell off. In a panic, he couldn't listen to any of [COCO]'s comforting words. He stood up and rushed into the bathroom, almost pressing his face against the mirror. After staring at himself for a long time, he couldn't help but reach out and pull at the eyebrow on the right side.
0:30:7|0:30:22|Who knew that with just a little force, a clump of hair would be pulled out from between his fingers. He stubbornly tugged at the left eyebrow, twisting a hair instantly around his finger. What's even more terrifying is that, when [Chen Jiaqiao] was taking a bath, he found that the amount of hair falling into the bathtub seemed as if it had been cut by someone.
0:30:22|0:30:34|He incredulously scooped out the hair, grabbed a handful on his head, and [Chen Jiaqiao] couldn't help but tremble, weakly leaning against the wall. He frantically rinsed his head with running water, rubbing it non-stop.
0:30:34|0:30:48|After the breakdown, she hugged her head, washed up, wiped the water droplets off the mirror, ran her fingers through her hair again, and as expected, ended up with a handful of hair. [COCO] looked at the mirror covered with hair and couldn't help but walk in.
0:30:59|0:31:12|Jiaqiao weakly leaned on [COCO] as if clinging to the last straw of life. Hearing the nurse's call, Jiaqiao walked into the consultation room dejectedly. A male doctor took forceps and kept peeling Jiaqiao's hair.
0:31:23|0:31:26|Extract several active hair follicles from the patient's subcutaneous tissue.
0:31:49|0:32:9|At this moment, [Yanzi] is still guarding the lonely stove. When she lifts the lid, thick steam rushes out. [Coco] stands in her own kitchen, pondering for half an hour before taking out her phone and dialing a number.
0:32:53|0:33:10|Later, the Chinese doctor had Jiaqiao lie on the bed and applied several fire cups to his back to draw out toxins, followed by acupuncture treatment. Before long, long and thin needles were inserted all over his head, resembling a hedgehog. Suddenly, a stream of blood flowed down his forehead, leaving Chen Jiaqiao shocked and scared.
0:33:39|0:33:49|[Chen Jiaqiao] rushed out of the traditional Chinese medicine shop, pushing away [COCO]'s arm, and walked down the stairs without looking back, leaving her standing alone in place feeling wronged.
0:34:9|0:34:14|Gu Xiaofan handed a freshly brewed cup of tea to [COCO] with a smile.
0:34:40|0:34:58|Gu Xiaofan smiled meaningfully and gently pushed the stone box to [COCO]'s side. After the conversation ended, Gu Xiaofan left quietly. Before the vehicle started, he waved to [COCO], who seemed to still be immersed in the struggle with [Chen Jiaqiao], a little absent-mindedly. Soon.
0:35:0|0:35:18|[COCO] carried a huge stone tablet on her arm, walking casually. Suddenly, she stopped in front of a bookstore, furrowing her brows in hesitation for a few seconds before absentmindedly stepping inside. After some searching, she pulled out a book titled "Daily Cuisine" edited by Gu Xiaofan from the corner of the cooking section.
0:35:19|0:35:29|However, at the moment when she turned the page, [COCO] froze, only to see a photo of Gu Xiaofan in the book, and the recent Gu Xiaofan she had been in contact with was completely different.
0:35:36|0:35:43|[COCO] unbelievably flipped through the cover's name, then turned the page again to look at the photo.
0:36:15|0:36:33|At this moment, a chill shot straight to his forehead, causing him to weakly lower his hand and slowly squat down against the wall of 1308. At the same time, another family was energetically changing windows, and what was even more terrifying was that Gu Xiaofan's stove and sand pot appeared in this family.
0:36:33|0:36:43|The person who has been pretending to be Gu Xiaofan is none other than Chen Jiaqiao's wife, [Yanzi]. At this moment, Chen Jiaqiao, dressed in casual home attire, stretches lazily beside her.
0:36:59|0:37:9|Upon seeing [Chen Jiaqiao] pick up the medicine bottle, [Yanzi] immediately set down the ingredients in her hand, grabbed a glass and went to fetch water. As [Chen Jiaqiao] reached out, the glass of water was smoothly placed into his hand.
0:37:13|0:37:32|[Jiaqiao] finished the medicine, weakly coughed and got up, then impatiently glanced out the window. On the other side, [Coco] kept flipping through two "Daily Gourmet" magazines, trying to find a clue. [Yanzi] propped up her chin with one hand, gently looking at [Jiaqiao] in front of her, then picked up the chopsticks to prepare to pick up some food.
0:37:32|0:37:40|Suddenly, [Chen Jiaqiao] put down the chopsticks in her hand, took out a delicate velvet jewelry box from under the table, opened it, and handed it to [Yanzi].
0:37:46|0:38:4|[Yanzi] ignored [Chen Jiaqiao]'s fake smile, staring expressionlessly at the necklace in front of him. After a long time, he reached out to take it. [Chen Jiaqiao] smiled, lowered his head, picked up some rice and took a few bites. Meanwhile, [Yanzi] slowly took out the necklace from the box, but hesitated to put it on.
0:38:4|0:38:19|[Jiaqiao] stood up again after seeing the situation, walked around behind [Yanzi], took the necklace from her hands, carefully unfastened the clasp, and gently put it around [Yanzi]'s neck. However, [Yanzi]'s expression remained indifferent, showing no sign of joy.
0:38:19|0:38:28|Until [Chen Jiaqiao] pulled her into his arms and kissed her, [Yanzi] finally showed a hint of a smile. [Chen Jiaqiao] gently placed his hand on her shoulder to comfort her, then sat back in his seat.
0:38:29|0:38:38|[Yanzi] caressed the pendant on her collarbone, still lost in thought with a blank expression, then the two continued to peacefully have lunch.
0:38:45|0:38:57|[Yanzi] focused on peeling the shrimp in her hand, as if it was just a casual remark. [Chen Jiaqiao] paused for a moment, then set down her chopsticks, took out a tissue, wiped her mouth leisurely, and leaned towards [Yanzi].
0:39:2|0:39:29|[Yanzi] still showed no emotions, but instead dipped the peeled shrimp in sauce and handed it to [Chen Jiaqiao]. Without hesitation, [Chen Jiaqiao] opened his mouth and swallowed the shrimp, even playfully nibbling on [Yanzi]'s fingers. [Yanzi] carefully helped [Chen Jiaqiao] put on his coat.
0:39:40|0:39:48|[Yanzi], like every virtuous wife, tied a tie for her husband. After tidying up the clothes neatly, she watched him walk out of the house.
0:39:51|0:40:5|On the other side, [COCO] was not as leisurely, he kept staring at the computer screen without a moment's rest, searching for all the information about Gu Xiaofan. However, no matter how he searched, the Gu Xiaofan on the webpage of Daily Gourmet was not the one he knew.
0:40:5|0:40:8|He tried his best to support himself and move forward, even greeting his colleagues was very difficult for him.
0:40:31|0:40:41|[Chen Jiaqiao] wore sunglasses, making it hard to see his expression. However, his complexion revealed a hint of illness, barely holding up. At this moment, the secretary also approached.
0:40:45|0:40:59|[Chen Jiaqiao] impatiently took the documents from the secretary and flipped through them as he walked. Suddenly, he felt dizzy and the world spinning around him. He stopped in his tracks, his eyes uncontrollably rolling upwards, and then he collapsed directly to the ground.
0:40:59|0:41:12|[Chen Jiaqiao] lying on the ground, foaming at the mouth and convulsing, scattered documents all over the floor, was rushed to the hospital the next second. At this moment, [Chen Jiaqiao] on the emergency bed was already unconscious, with remnants of vomit still uncleaned at the corner of his mouth.
0:41:13|0:41:22|The surgical lights in the operating room all lit up, and [Doctor] skillfully opened [Chen Jiaqiao]'s eyelids to observe the condition of the pupils, and the surgery proceeded in an orderly manner.
0:41:49|0:41:56|On screen, as a fan of Luo Yi, Yanzi and COCO are tightly hugging each other, making COCO feel a chill down his spine.
0:42:58|0:43:1|[Yanzi] looked at [Chen Jiaqiao] lying on the sickbed, with a mocking smile on her face.
0:43:32|0:43:40|[Yanzi] looked at [Chen Jiaqiao]'s attending physician, the sarcasm in her eyes vanished, replaced by deep concern and heaviness.
0:43:40|0:43:52|With an excellent professional background, [Yanzi] effortlessly took [Chen Jiaqiao] out of the hospital. [Yanzi] had her hair tied in a simple ponytail, wearing a chiffon shirt with partially exposed sleeves, showcasing her sexy shoulders.
0:43:53|0:44:8|His smile was content yet gloomy, using only a wheelchair to take Chen Jiaqiao out of the hospital. Although it was not yet autumn, Chen Jiaqiao was already wrapped in the coat of autumn. He tilted his head, dozing off weakly, unaware of his whereabouts.
0:44:8|0:44:14|And [Yanzi], seemingly tireless, pushed him out of the hospital and crossed numerous streets to reach the riverside.
0:44:15|0:44:31|Under the meticulous planning of [Yanzi], the man in front of her could no longer escape her control. At this moment, [Chen Jiaqiao] remained unaware, still treating [Yanzi] as a lifesaver. After boarding the boat, [Chen Jiaqiao] finally regained consciousness, weakly holding the hand resting on his shoulder.
0:44:35|0:44:49|[Yanzi] squatted down and lightly rubbed her forehead against [Chen Jiaqiao]'s cheek, as if nothing had happened. Now, [Chen Jiaqiao] didn't even have the strength to bathe himself. He sat slumped in the bathtub, letting [Yanzi] wipe him down.
0:45:4|0:45:17|Watching his wife tuck him in, [Chen Jiaqiao] couldn't help but move closer to her embrace. [Yanzi] gently stroked her husband's blanket and whispered softly in his ear.
0:45:55|0:45:58|Chen Jiaqiao and Monk Yan tightly hold Yanzi's hands.
0:46:2|0:46:11|[Yanzi] freed up one hand and brought the soup bowl, which had been placed on the edge of the bathtub, in front of [Chen Jiaqiao]. Without any resistance, [Chen Jiaqiao] picked up the bowl and started to drink heartily.
0:46:35|0:46:51|[COCO] did not bring the stone box, but hurriedly walked to the roadside, hailed a taxi, and immediately told the driver where she wanted to go. [Yanzi] followed without suspicion and arrived at the old teahouse.
0:46:59|0:47:9|[Yanzi] smiled and hung up the phone, without lingering in the teahouse, she got up and left directly. Little did she know, [COCO] was sitting in the coffee shop downstairs, secretly observing her.
0:47:9|0:47:21|[Yanzi] saw [COCO] leaving her seat, lost in thought. Just as she turned to look outside the door, she saw [Luo Yi] walking towards the cafe. [COCO] was immediately startled, pressing against the wall and clutching her chest.
0:47:22|0:47:37|Fortunately, [Yanzi] just turned at the door and walked forward calmly. [COCO] sat at the table, calming down, and after confirming that [Yanzi] had walked far away, she picked up the phone on the table and sneaked out of the café. At this moment, she still didn't know,
0:47:37|0:47:44|This seemingly seamless tracking plan was completely exposed by [Yanzi] with just one phone call.
0:47:56|0:48:6|Yanzi, who hung up the phone, breathed a sigh of relief and glanced at the rearview mirror, only to see a taxi following her, while COCO was unaware that she had been discovered.
0:48:10|0:48:24|The taxi driver, living up to the trust, closely followed and brought [COCO] to an underground parking lot. [Yanzi] locked the car door and walked into the passage unhurriedly. She even slowed down her pace, disappearing just as [COCO] got out of the car.
0:48:24|0:48:35|[COCO] confirmed once again that the car parked next to her was [Yanzi]'s car, then immediately ran into the corridor. She arrived at the floor where [Yanzi] was. Even though the aisle was covered with understated luxury marble, she didn't have time to worry about it.
0:48:36|0:48:51|The door of room 5201 on the right was not closed, but slightly ajar, and [COCO] cautiously approached, peering through the crack. Suddenly, the door opened, and [Yanzi] stood unabashedly at the doorway, smiling and waving at [COCO].
0:48:56|0:49:11|Faced with [Yanzi]'s invitation, [COCO] hesitated greatly, but curiosity ultimately prevailed, leading her into the room. Beyond the dim vestibule was a wall-mounted open bookshelf, filled with photos of [Yanzi] and [Chen Jiaqiao].
0:49:11|0:49:16|[COCO] felt a chill run down her spine, unable to resist hugging her arms tightly, as she echoed with a sharp and probing tone.
0:49:20|0:49:27|[Yanzi] looked [Coco] straight in the eyes, explaining calmly, while [Coco] sat slumped at the dining table, wearing an expression of disbelief.
0:49:50|0:50:16|At this moment, [Chen Jiaqiao] was eavesdropping by the bedroom door, listening to the conversation between the two. The pitiful expression on [COCO]'s face was immediately replaced by one of disbelief. [Yanzi] always had a smile on her face as she casually pushed a recipe book in front of [COCO].
0:50:50|0:50:55|Speak up, [Yanzi] has turned to the third page of the recipe again.
0:50:56|0:51:6|[COCO] looked at the recipe, lost in thought, vaguely remembering the steamed crab and brightly colored stir-fried mushrooms that she had personally fed to [Chen Jiaqiao].
0:51:14|0:51:33|At the sight of this recipe, [COCO] immediately recalled the day when [Yanzi] came to help her cook fish at home. As the delicious catfish was placed on the family dining table, the conflicting pig liver soup was also served on another table. Chen Jiaqiao behind the door looked anxious, tightly covering his mouth, trying not to make a sound.
0:52:24|0:52:36|The scene shifts to a supermarket, where the pregnant belly of [Yanzi] is clearly visible on the screen. Nurses are smiling and celebrating joyfully around [Yanzi], who is expecting a baby.
0:52:37|0:52:52|[Yanzi] is beaming with happiness, she props up her body and feels the heartbeat of the child. After the check-up, she goes to the market as usual, buys a catfish that [Chen Jiaqiao] loves to eat, and selects some side dishes. In no time, her hands are full.
0:52:53|0:53:11|However, as they were waiting to cross the road at the traffic lights, an unexpected scene unfolded. Not far away, the familiar car appeared. When the car came to a stop, the pregnant wife witnessed her husband kissing another woman with her own eyes. [Yanzi] was furious and stared fixedly at their car, walking quickly towards the middle of the road.
0:53:11|0:53:16|However, at this moment, a truck came rushing in and knocked [Yanzi] down to the ground.
0:53:17|0:53:27|Surrounded by onlookers, even Chen Jiaqiao leaned out of the car window curiously to join the commotion. People around were hesitant to move the pregnant woman and could only make phone calls to wait for the paramedics.
0:53:44|0:53:52|[Yanzi] lowered her eyes and quietly finished telling [COCO] everything, but when she looked up, her eyes were empty and lifeless.
0:53:58|0:54:19|[COCO] turned away from [Yanzi], tightly closed her eyes, allowing tears to slide down her cheeks, while Jiaqiao regretfully hugged her head and crouched on the ground. Then, [Yanzi] invited [COCO] to visit another room. The moment [COCO] pushed the door open and entered, she fell into contemplation.
0:54:20|0:54:31|This is clearly a carefully arranged nursery, with wind chimes swaying at the door and butterfly decorations in the center, all indicating [Yanzi]'s expectations for this child.
0:54:31|0:54:49|[COCO], with red eyes, kept lighting up various toys prepared for the baby in the room, while [Yanzi] calmly leaned against the door, showing no intention of going in. When [COCO] picked up a pair of soft baby shoes, tears couldn't help but fall from her eyes, while [Yanzi], strong and robust, raised a smile.
0:55:7|0:55:18|[Yanzi] did not answer, but instead led her to the door at the entrance. [COCO] kept her head down, lagging three or four steps behind [Yanzi], seeming to hesitate whether to take one last look at Chen Jiaqiao.
0:55:18|0:55:29|[Yanzi] glanced back at [COCO], then opened the door and left. As the door opened, [COCO] instinctively took a few steps forward, wanting to catch another glimpse of the person who had been on his mind day and night.
0:56:11|0:56:27|[COCO] stopped in her confused tracks because of these words. She looked at [Yanzi] in disbelief, then turned angrily and walked away. Jiaqiao remained sitting on the bed, tears silently streaming down her face. [COCO] left [Yanzi]'s house and immediately went to get drunk with her best friend.
0:56:27|0:56:45|The two sat in front of a street food stall, with seven or eight empty beer bottles on the table. However, [COCO], whose emotions were out of control, had no interest in drinking, only crying in pain from hunger. Her best friend [Yanzi] did not try to stop her, quietly drinking beer herself, accompanying [COCO].
0:56:45|0:56:58|After an unknown amount of time, the surrounding guests gradually left, and even the food stalls pulled down their curtains to prepare for rest. At this moment, there were over a dozen bottles of alcohol on the table, with [Yanzi] still sober and humble, while [COCO] had already passed out on the table.
0:57:20|0:57:42|Sensing something amiss, Chen Jiaqiao, her best friend, panicked instantly. When COCO woke up again, she found herself lying on a hospital bed. Seeing COCO awake, her best friend breathed a sigh of relief, gently stroking her forehead with a smile. At that moment, Luo Yi was happily playing with a hamster.
0:57:45|0:57:59|The mischievous hamster is locked in a wheel, running frantically causing it to spin rapidly. [Chen Jiaqiao] sits quietly on the side, suppressing his inner fear, holding [Yanzi]'s hand, discussing with the kind-hearted [COCO].
0:57:59|0:58:5|[Yanzi]'s smile froze on her face, ignoring [Chen Jiaqiao], who couldn't help but move closer.
0:58:9|0:58:17|[Yanzi] still ignored him, focusing on the hamster in front of her, occasionally playing with the cage to make the hamster run faster.
0:58:30|0:58:41|After a long time, [Yanzi]'s gaze finally left the hamster in front of her. She slowly raised her head, looked at the serious [Chen Jiaqiao], and showed a smile, which was gentle enough to make one's whole body shiver.
0:58:45|0:58:58|[Yanzi] stared at [Chen Jiaqiao] intently, causing [Chen Jiaqiao] to involuntarily take a step back in fear. Sensing his emotions, [Yanzi] smiled and reached out to hold his hand in an attempt to comfort him, but a tear silently slid down her cheek.
0:59:1|0:59:15|[Yanzi] spoke gently but unquestionably, holding a bowl of soup in her right hand and gripping [Chen Jiaqiao]'s chin with her left hand, pouring the soup directly down his throat. At that moment, [Chen Jiaqiao] was like a hamster trapped in a spinning wheel, completely at the mercy of [Yanzi].
0:59:16|0:59:36|That day, [Chen Jiaqiao] lay naked and confused in the bathtub, covering his face with his hands, seemingly unable to accept his current state of life. As his hands slowly dropped, his gaze focused on the wedding ring on his left ring finger. He took it off, held it up above his head, and stared at it for a long time, with a hint of timid anger in his eyes.
0:59:36|0:59:40|In the end, he released his fingers and let the wedding ring fall into the water.
0:59:46|0:59:56|At this moment, [Yanzi] was standing in front of the stove as usual, making porridge. When she saw the incoming call on her phone, she rolled her eyes lightly and impatiently answered the phone.
1:0:11|1:0:30|[Yanzi] raised her head, as if pondering something. [Chen Jiaqiao] now lived a reclusive life, drawing the curtains tightly to shroud the living room in darkness. He was seen lying on the sofa, weakly reaching out to pick up the telephone receiver, but after listening for a moment, there was no sound at all.
1:0:30|1:0:38|[Chen Jiaqiao] only then realized that all the telephone lines had been cut by [Yanzi]. He reached out and wound the telephone line around a few times, pulling it down to the ground with force.
1:0:48|1:0:54|COCO remained silent for a long time, and Yanzi looked up at him calmly.
1:1:35|1:1:51|Chen Jiaqiao pulled open the curtains as if venting, and the glaring sunlight immediately filled the room. He tried to open the window, but failed without a doubt, as the phone he was holding had its battery removed by [Yanzi]. Helplessly, he raised his arm and symbolically tapped on the glass, struggling a few times.
1:1:52|1:2:10|Entering the room, there was originally only a door lock, but now an additional password lock has been added. Now he doesn't even have the strength to walk to the door. He sits in the wheelchair, desperately hitting the door, but to no avail. Helplessly, he can only turn the wheelchair around and slide towards the living room.
1:2:10|1:2:15|Chen Jiaqiao kept spinning in circles in the small area of the living room in his wheelchair.
1:2:25|1:2:42|Chen Jiaqiao used the last bit of strength to stand up, lifted the wheelchair and smashed it towards the window, but the window had been replaced with bulletproof glass, unmoved. COCO was crying sadly, then her expression suddenly changed.
1:2:42|1:2:53|At the moment when he ran towards the toilet, covering his mouth and retching, a crack finally appeared on the usually calm face of [Yanzi].
1:3:8|1:3:24|At this moment, [COCO] only just realized the true identity of [Yanzi], staring wide-eyed. Meanwhile, [Chen Jiaqiao] was squatting by the bathtub lost in thought, motionless as he gazed at the ventilation opening on the window, which was almost his only way out.
1:3:24|1:3:33|He immediately gathered up the white paper scattered on the living room floor. Without a pen, he could only bite his finger in distress and write the final life-saving message with blood.
1:3:34|1:3:47|Before long, the words "Save me 5201" were written on several pieces of white paper. As his fingers ran out of blood, he bit down even harder, not daring to stop even with a mouth full of blood.
1:3:47|1:3:57|[Chen Jiaqiao] seemed to see the hope of freedom. After writing on all the white papers, he carefully folded them into paper airplanes and then stuffed them out through the gaps between the fan blades of the ventilation duct.
1:3:58|1:4:13|At this moment, [Chen Jiaqiao]'s heart was swaying more severely than the paper airplane in the air. He pressed himself against the glass window, trying hard to observe the trajectory of the plane's descent. Downstairs, the playing children seemed to have discovered a new continent, all gathering towards a vacant lot.
1:4:18|1:4:37|Unfortunately, [Yanzi]'s car happened to pass by here. She looked at the group of children holding paper airplanes, rolled down the window, with a hint of coldness in her eyes. Then, [Yanzi] picked up the skirt and stone box returned by [COCO], and walked back home. She remained expressionless, and even the floor cleaner didn't notice anything unusual.
1:4:37|1:4:42|At this moment, [Chen Jiaqiao] crouched by the gate, and as she heard the sound of the door opening, she decisively lifted her head.
1:5:13|1:5:28|[Yanzi] calmly explained everything, staring at Baojie with a cautious look, then got up and dragged [Chen Jiaqiao] by the legs into the room. Baojie didn't want to cause trouble, so she gave a signal and retreated around the corner, continuing to drag the hallway with all her might.
1:5:28|1:5:33|After closing the door, [Yanzi] quickly turned both locks and set a new passcode.
1:5:35|1:5:46|In the dimly lit living room, [Chen Jiaqiao] sat in a wheelchair, his arms securely tied to the armrests. He choked back tears, trying to break free, but the ropes remained unmoved. At that moment, [Yanzi] slowly squatted in front of him.
1:5:54|1:6:9|[Chen Jiaqiao] let out a sigh, looking at his wife who had already turned into a demon with tears in his eyes. [Yanzi] held [Chen Jiaqiao]'s hand devoutly, putting the wedding ring that she had long discarded back on her left ring finger. Now, [Chen Jiaqiao] had given up the struggle. Chapter Two of the film, "Trap".
1:6:12|1:6:25|The elevator doors open, revealing [COCO] with a slight bulge in her abdomen. She has a handbag slung over her right shoulder and is dragging a suitcase with her left hand, leaning wearily against the inside wall lost in thought. Gathering herself, she straightens up, holding back tears, and walks out of the elevator.
1:6:31|1:6:47|[COCO] picked up the phone, stared at the caller ID, remained silent for a while, and then continued to drag her heavy steps forward. However, the other party had no intention of hanging up, the annoying ringtone kept echoing in her ears. After a few more steps, [COCO] finally stopped in frustration.
1:7:50|1:8:4|[COCO] tightly closed his eyes, allowing tears to flow down. This man always managed to break through his inner defenses in the quickest way possible. He cried uncontrollably, only able to support his forehead to ease his emotions. In the end, [COCO] still chose to go see [Chen Jiaqiao] for the last time.
1:8:4|1:8:20|In the taxi on the way to the other party's home, [COCO] took out her phone, found her friend Zhang Qing's number, and dialed it. However, at this moment, Zhang Qing and her police boyfriend were on a date at the cinema, happily cuddling together and eating popcorn, completely unaware of this life-saving call.
1:8:20|1:8:32|The phone call went unanswered, leaving [COCO] feeling very uneasy. After sending a text message, he hurriedly rushed to the doorstep of [Chen Jiaqiao]'s house. Just like last time, the door was still half open, but inside was eerily quiet.
1:8:33|1:8:52|[Coco] stood at the door and called out tentatively, but received no response. She took a few steps forward. [Coco] carefully pushed open the door, still not seeing the figure that haunted her dreams. She couldn't hide the worry on her face and took a few more steps inside.
1:8:52|1:8:59|At this moment, [COCO] stood by the living room, shining around looking for [Chen Jiaqiao]'s figure, but still found nothing.
1:9:4|1:9:14|[Coco] stood by the wall, feeling something was not right. However, before he could react, [Yanzi] covered [Coco]'s mouth and nose with a towel from behind. Chen Jiaqiao looked expressionless at the unconscious [Coco] in the distance.
1:9:38|1:9:50|COCO suddenly woke up at this moment. [Yanzi] crossed her arms and leisurely approached Chen Jiaqiao.
1:9:58|1:10:15|[Yanzi] held Chen Jiaqiao's face and roared wildly, a scene that sent shivers down COCO's spine. She scrambled to her feet and ran towards the door in a panic, with [Yanzi] following closely behind. Taking advantage of the distraction, Chen Jiaqiao managed to break free from the ropes binding him and swiftly rushed forward, tackling [Yanzi] to the ground.
1:10:15|1:10:30|While the couple was fighting, [COCO] hurriedly knocked on the door for help, but no one responded. At this moment, [Yanzi] had already taken out a stun gun from her bag and Chen Jiaqiao desperately dodged, preventing the weapon from hitting her.
1:10:30|1:10:46|Just as the two were fighting over it, the stun gun was thrown to the wall near [COCO]. At this moment, [COCO] was at a loss and watched helplessly as Jiaqiao rode on [Yanzi], hands tightly gripping her neck. It was obvious that Jiaqiao was determined this time. Before long, [Yanzi] had much less strength to struggle.
1:10:47|1:11:2|In the end, [COCO] picked up the electric motor at his feet and pressed it directly against the neck of [Chen Jiaqiao], allowing [Yanzi] to break free. [Chen Jiaqiao] was once again tied to the wheelchair, but this time, unlike before, not only his arms, but his whole body was wrapped in ropes.
1:11:2|1:11:14|[COCO] nervously raised the electric drill, aiming it at [Yanzi]'s face. [Yanzi] showed no fear, smiling as she took a few steps closer.
1:11:17|1:11:26|Seeing the girl in front of her with a determined look of returning at all costs, [Yanzi] shook her head helplessly.
1:11:44|1:11:59|[Yanzi] appeared calm on the surface, but her eyes were filled with stubbornness and madness. [COCO] was frozen by this sharp gaze and couldn't move for a moment. [Yanzi] smiled slightly at the sight, calmly took the electric shaver from her hand, and gently ran it over her hair.
1:11:59|1:12:8|[COCO] desperately pounded on the door and called out, but still received no response.
1:12:14|1:12:31|[COCO], who had given up struggling, slumped against the door, eyes vacant. At that moment, [Yanzi] wheeled in a medical cart, equipped with surgical instruments, medical gloves, and everything needed for the operation. The medical tools emitted a chilling metallic sheen, causing [COCO] to involuntarily shrink back.
1:12:31|1:12:36|[Yanzi] paid no attention to [COCO]'s little movements, and gently squatted down in front of her.
1:12:49|1:12:55|At this moment, as the movie theater just started, [Chen Jiaqiao] took out her phone to check the messages.
1:13:29|1:13:35|After dealing with the company's affairs, [Yanzi] sat in Chen Jiaqiao's office chair, waiting for the secretary to tidy up the documents.
1:13:40|1:13:59|[Yanzi] looked coldly ahead, staring motionless at the cabinet in the distance. At the same time, [Chen Jiaqiao] arrived at the Heike Camp 5201 as mentioned by [COCO], accompanied by her police boyfriend. With a nod from her boyfriend, [Chen Jiaqiao] quietly approached the door and knocked.
1:13:59|1:14:3|At the same time as Chen Jiaqiao knocked on the door, her boyfriend also felt something was wrong and looked around suspiciously.
1:14:7|1:14:28|At this moment, [COCO] was tied up with his hands behind his back and thrown into the nursery. Upon hearing his friend's call, he quickly got up and ran towards the door. [Yanzi] had obviously anticipated this and had already locked the nursery door, while [Chen Jiaqiao] in the living room was tightly bound to a wheelchair, unable to move, with his mouth taped shut, unable to make a sound.
1:14:28|1:14:33|Suddenly, Chen Jiaqiao's police boyfriend took two steps forward and looked thoughtfully at the three locks on the door of the room.
1:14:58|1:15:14|Facing [Yanzi]'s questioning, [Chen Jiaqiao] pursed his lips, lowered his head, and remained silent, which completely annoyed [Yanzi]. [Yanzi] turned her head, staring straight at [Chen Jiaqiao], who still had his lips pursed, showing a hint of timidity, but still remained silent.
1:15:30|1:15:36|Upon hearing these words, a hint of crack finally appeared on the face of [Chen Jiaqiao], who had been fearless, immediately noticed by [Yanzi].
1:15:46|1:16:1|The door of the safe was popped open, and [Yanzi] reached in and pulled out an envelope. In front of the three people, [Yanzi] emptied the contents of the envelope onto the table, her eyes widening involuntarily, while [Chen Jiaqiao] rested his head in his hands, clearly not wanting to face it.
1:16:1|1:16:8|In the thick stack of photos, [Yanzi] spread them out and found that they were all pictures of [Chen Jiaqiao] with different women.
1:16:9|1:16:22|In the photos, some are kissing, some are hugging, directly showing the intimate relationship between the two. Some photos even have a string of text written on the back. [Yanzi] flipped through them and pulled out one to read aloud.
1:16:48|1:16:57|[Chen Jiaqiao] clasped his hands together and closed his eyes tightly, while [Yanzi] glanced at him and then picked up a photo, flipping it over to read aloud from the back.
1:17:10|1:17:24|The girl in the photo is very young, with her hands around [Chen Jiaqiao]'s neck, her bright face filled with a beautiful smile. [Yanzi] tears streaming down her face, puts down the photo in her hand, then picks up the next one to look at it in a self-torturing manner.
1:17:54|1:18:9|[Chen Jiaqiao] calmly opened his eyes, leaning forward as if seeking the right answer. Now, facing the intense gaze of [Yanzi], [Chen Jiaqiao] showed no fear, even managing to smile back and look directly at her. Then, he tried to adjust to a more comfortable position.
1:18:44|1:18:57|At this moment, [COCO] finally realized that the nest of joy in her heart was nothing but a gilded cage in the eyes of [Chen Jiaqiao]. With a look of disgust at [Chen Jiaqiao], she got up and left the living room.
1:18:58|1:19:14|[Yanzi] finally couldn't contain the anger in her heart. As [COCO] rushed into the bedroom, she took three or four steps to reach [Chen Jiaqiao] and slapped him hard. Jiaqiao had anticipated this and looked at [Yanzi] with a wide-open mouth, appearing innocent.
1:19:19|1:19:37|The table full of photos scattered, silently accusing Chen Jiaqiao's misdeeds. In the epilogue, liberation. The kitchen belongs to [Yanzi], where green shrimp are poured into the oil pan, visibly changing color, tomatoes sliced thinly, radishes neatly lined up, and the soup made from fish balls is fresh and translucent.
1:19:38|1:19:56|The oil in the pot kept bubbling, the color of the food was mouth-watering. The zucchini was shredded to remove the soft core in the middle, and the bitter melon was sliced with precision, each slice of consistent thickness. Soon, over a dozen dishes were brought to the table, with Chen Jiaqiao sitting in the middle, unabashedly picking up the braised prawns.
1:20:0|1:20:9|Chen Jiaqiao shook his head and ate a few mouthfuls of rice, then picked up the soup bowl and drank it until the bowl was empty, as Yanzi said from the right side.
1:20:13|1:20:29|Finally, he picked up the shrimp from the pot on the left, eating and spitting out the shells.
1:20:41|1:20:45|Jiaqiao generously also served a bowl of vegetables to [Yanzi] on the left.
1:21:18|1:21:31|He frowned discontentedly, raised his glass and drank it all in one gulp. Two women sat facing each other on either side, always bowing their heads in silence.
1:21:36|1:21:56|Chen Jiaqiao stared at the food on the table for a long time, then slapped his thigh, got up and left. Only after Chen Jiaqiao left did Yanzi slightly tilt her head and look towards the dim light. Chen Jiaqiao then went to the bathroom, stood in front of the mirror and revealed a perfect smile. Then, she leaned in closer, carefully examining her own face.
1:21:56|1:22:4|In Yanzi's silent recipe, her eyebrows are almost gone. Chen Jiaqiao breathed a sigh of relief and picked up an eyebrow pencil to draw eyebrows.
1:22:5|1:22:19|He furrowed his brows for a long time, until he was satisfied with the left side, then switched the pen to his right hand and started drawing the right eyebrow. Drawing eyebrows is not an easy task, and before long, Jiaqiao became a bit irritable, even his breathing became heavier.
1:22:19|1:22:38|After finally drawing the eyebrows to his satisfaction, [Chen Jiaqiao] raised the corners of his mouth, took a selfie with his eyebrows, and put down the eyebrow pencil. However, in the next scene, something incredible happened. [Chen Jiaqiao] picked up other cosmetics, fiercely pressed some foundation onto a powder puff, and skillfully patted it onto his face.
1:22:38|1:22:55|At this moment, the two women in the restaurant still had no idea what had happened, still looking at each other in silence. [Chen Jiaqiao] stared at herself in the mirror, smiling in a very eerie way. He lit up the dressing table again, finally picked up a lipstick, and saw her tentatively twisting out her inner thoughts, aiming at her lips in the mirror.
1:22:55|1:23:0|With each vigorous stroke of lipstick, [Chen Jiaqiao]'s mouth instantly became a vibrant display of color.
1:23:4|1:23:21|After all this, [Chen Jiaqiao] sighed, looking at the mirror. The person in the mirror had broad eyebrows, bright eyes, and fair complexion - it was herself, yet not quite herself. [Chen Jiaqiao] slowly leaned towards the mirror and left a lip print on it, perhaps the last thing she wanted to leave in this world.
1:23:23|1:23:41|Finally, he opened the cabinet behind the mirror and took out all five bottles of vitamin C inside, making sure to close the cabinet door after. [Chen Jiaqiao] sat by the bathtub, neatly lining up the medications. As he filled the bathtub with water, he poured the vitamin C into his palm and took it to his mouth.
1:23:42|1:23:56|Continuing on, she directly opened the medicine bottle and poured it into her mouth as if chewing candy. [Yanzi] finally reacted first, slowly raising her head to look towards the bathroom. Suddenly her face changed, while [COCO] was still lying on the table immersed in sadness.
1:23:58|1:24:15|The water in the bathtub kept overflowing, flowing down the steps. The edge of the bathtub was scattered with pills, and the medicine bottle was swaying under the impact of the water flow. When [Yanzi] opened the door, this was the scene she saw - [Chen Jiaqiao] fully clothed, lying in the bathtub, with his whole body already submerged in water.
1:24:15|1:24:35|Her expression was unusually calm, apparently already breathless. [Yanzi] found it difficult to accept everything in front of her for a moment, relying solely on instinct to move forward. Upon hearing the noise, [COCO] came over and, after seeing the scene, took a few steps back and leaned against the door frame. She didn't know how to calm herself down, so she could only breathe heavily.
1:24:35|1:24:41|Until standing at the edge of the bathtub, [Yanzi]'s expression finally changed, she lay down on the ground, staring straight at the water surface.
1:24:42|1:25:1|[Chen Jiaqiao], a man who is hailed as a successful gentleman in society, ultimately pays the price for his insatiable greed. The prawns on the dining table and the high doses of vitamin C can produce trimethylamine and P cream, leading to death. In order to completely free himself, [Chen Jiaqiao] is willing to drown himself in the water tank.
1:25:1|1:25:4|Is it self-liberation or escaping from everything, no one can say for sure.
1:25:5|1:25:20|Early the next morning, [Chen Jiaqiao] sat in a wheelchair, pushed out by [Yanzi]. She was dressed in a sharp pinstripe suit with a colorful tie, her eyes tightly closed and her face bruised, silently reminding everyone that she had left this world.
1:25:21|1:25:35|[COCO] wearily sat up and was almost scared out of her wits when she saw this scene. However, [Yanzi] remained unfazed. She was dressed in a clean white shirt, with her hair neatly arranged, pushing the wheelchair to the window.
1:25:35|1:25:42|[Yanzi] squatted down, carefully adjusting [Chen Jiaqiao]'s tie, then straightened her collar, affectionately stroking her chin.
1:25:47|1:25:59|[COCO] saw this scene and didn't even dare to breathe, trembling all over. [Yanzi] picked up the already prepared porridge again, stirring it carefully, afraid of scalding the person in front of her.
1:26:10|1:26:26|No matter how affectionate [Yanzi] is, [Chen Jiaqiao] in front of her gives her no response. [Yanzi] is indifferent to this, still spooning porridge into [Chen Jiaqiao]'s mouth. The lifeless body, unable to function, naturally cannot swallow, and the porridge slowly flows down from the corner of [Chen Jiaqiao]'s mouth.
1:26:26|1:26:33|[Yanzi] gently wipes with a handkerchief, as if taking care of a child. Then, she pushes [Chen Jiaqiao] to the balcony.
1:26:52|1:27:7|[Yanzi] turned the wheelchair towards the outside, admiring the familiar scenery together with [Chen Jiaqiao]. The tall buildings here looked prosperous from a distance. The cable car across the river resembled a small square box, sliding down the cableway and disappearing among the buildings.
1:27:8|1:27:22|The river is filled with boats of all sizes, everyone busy and bustling for their livelihood. Suddenly, [COCO] looks towards the door, only to see a group of police officers rushing into the house with guns, led by Zhang Qing, her boyfriend.
1:27:22|1:27:37|The police carefully searched every corner of the room until they saw [COCO] was safe and sound, then they finally relaxed. At this moment, [COCO] had no strength to speak, silently glanced towards the balcony. Following this clue, the police successfully found [Yanzi] and [Chen Jiaqiao].
1:27:38|1:27:47|At this moment, [Yanzi] quietly looked at the beautiful scenery below the balcony. Even when she sensed the police approaching, she showed no signs of panic, as if she had anticipated everything.
1:28:9|1:28:24|The expensive jewelry in the Jinjian exudes a brilliant light, but all of this cannot hide the radiant smile of [Yanzi]. They crossed the bridge over the river and arrived at a rooftop. [Chen Jiaqiao] bent down and held the princess [Yanzi] in his arms.
1:28:32|1:28:36|Upon hearing these words, [Chen Jiaqiao] set [Yanzi] down and wrapped his arms around her waist.
1:28:50|1:29:6|After a sincere vow, [Chen Jiaqiao] kissed [Yanzi], who held him tightly and responded passionately. Perhaps only in this moment, [Chen Jiaqiao] was sincere. They say there's a seven-year itch, but [Chen Jiaqiao] had been disloyal throughout these six years.
1:29:6|1:29:13|[Yanzi] disguised herself as Gu Xiaofan, and the reason for getting close to the stingy seems to have an explanation, with a large amount of news on Gu Xiaofan's marital status being exposed.
1:29:14|1:29:30|First, Chen Jiaqiao's husband had a secret meeting with a mysterious woman at a nightclub, and Chen Jiaqiao's phone was turned off, refusing interviews. Then, Chen Jiaqiao's husband died violently on the street, suspected of poisoning, and the police intervened in the investigation. Later, Chen Jiaqiao fell from a building, and the police determined it as a suicide.
1:29:30|1:29:43|And the last piece of news is the suicide note left by Gu Xiaofan, with only one sentence: "I am utterly disappointed in marriage." The unbearable marriage crushed this successful woman, even causing her fans to imitate the same.
1:29:53|1:30:9|[COCO] is walking along the river in a floral dress, pushing a baby carriage. As an involved party, [Chen Jiaqiao] lets go due to helplessness towards love and self-feelings, leaving life to continue and allowing the originally closed three-person relationship to unfold over time.
1:30:10|1:30:20|But in fact, the most desperate thing in life is not ending life, not having little time left, but that life is far from over, and you have no possibility at all.
