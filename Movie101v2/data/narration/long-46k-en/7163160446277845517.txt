0:1:45|0:1:50|The [Hei Yu] tribe lives in the city of Skyhaven.
0:2:18|0:2:25|In the city of Tiandu, the young [Ni Kongkong] is hiding in a narrow cave, using a fence to block the entrance, nervously looking out of the cave.
0:2:42|0:2:47|An older child, a few years older than the others, shooed everyone away and spoke to [Ni Kongkong].
0:3:9|0:3:26|[Ni Kongkong] slowly moved away from the fence, looking timidly at the unfamiliar older child in front of the cave. The older child managed to trick [Ni Kongkong] out. At that moment, a young child unexpectedly pulled out a dagger and slid it towards the shining palm of [Ni Kongkong].
0:3:29|0:3:47|One afternoon many years later, the adult Ni Kongkong sat on the eaves of Tian Du City, looking at his still glowing palm, reminiscing about the painful memories of his childhood. At this moment, his pet Ouka bounced around beside him, gesturing excitedly. Ni Kongkong looked at it and said helplessly.
0:3:57|0:4:13|[Ni Kongkong] said, and then with Ouka, they leaped off the roof and arrived at the bustling main street of Tiandu City. The wide street was crowded with people coming and going, and the businesses along the street were thriving, with merchants from afar wandering between various shops.
0:4:55|0:5:8|At this moment, [Ni Kongkong] tossed a gold coin to him. But as soon as the boss turned around, [Ni Kongkong] slyly stole the gold coin back.
0:5:26|0:5:37|[Ni Kongkong] instantly recalled his son's ordeal, pulled out a dagger, and stabbed the burly man to the ground. As he stood up, he found himself surrounded by several thugs wielding machetes.
0:5:37|0:5:45|In the jianghu for many years, [Ni Kongkong] remained calm and composed. He swung an iron chain to the ground, and Ouka immediately grabbed the chain, curling up into a ball.
0:5:46|0:5:56|[Ni Kongkong] actually threw off several people from Ouka. Ouka, with its hard shell, is not suitable for any weapon, like a hammer mercilessly knocking down several people to the ground.
0:5:59|0:6:12|[Ni Kongkong] saw the situation was not good, so he released a mist bomb and prepared to escape. However, he was stopped by the King in the sky. After tying up [Ni Kongkong], the henchman's owner, holding a fake product, walked up to him and said.
0:6:50|0:6:55|Ni Kongkong had no choice but to take a risk.
0:7:19|0:7:27|When night fell, [Ni Kongkong] used lightness skills to arrive on the rooftop of the Prince's mansion, searching for the right moment.
0:7:40|0:7:51|At this moment, the Prince's mansion was filled with ice sculptures, and the courtyard was full of rare treasures beyond count. Even top-grade jade and agate were nothing special here. At this time, the steward of the mansion shouted to everyone,
0:8:31|0:8:46|The Prince stepped down and saw a seahorse emitting a strange light in the crystal stone. The seahorse had a head resembling a dragon's head, with two pairs of wings behind it. Although the Tian Du City had a variety of rare treasures, such a treasure could not be found anywhere else in the world.
0:8:46|0:8:56|The prince was still basking in the admiring gazes of the crowd, completely unaware that [Ni Kongkong] and Ou Ka had silently arrived at the underground palace in the prince's mansion where treasures were stored.
0:8:57|0:9:9|Ni Kongkong looked at the countless treasures in front of him, feeling overjoyed. But upon hearing the footsteps of the guards patrolling, he quickly hid with Ou Ka in the rafters. However, the guards with keen senses still sensed something unusual.
0:9:14|0:9:32|The guard thought he misheard and didn't pay attention, turning to leave. Unexpectedly, as soon as he turned around, he was pierced in the head by the assassin [Hei Yu], whose face resembled a bat. Following that, the even more terrifying-looking [Lei Bao] wielded a huge iron axe, splitting the surrounding guards in half one by one.
0:9:32|0:9:36|But as soon as they stepped into the entrance of the underground palace, they were instantly dealt with by the powerful [Feng Xiao].
0:9:44|0:9:50|The dying guard lunged at [Feng Xiao] while [He Ying] simultaneously threw a dart at him.
0:10:45|0:10:50|The smell of Eurcoffee's fart gradually spread from the rafters to below.
0:11:0|0:11:6|At that moment, the lanterns in the Prince's Mansion were mysteriously blown out by the wind. [He Ying] saw this and smiled charmingly, saying.
0:11:12|0:11:22|[Ni Kongkong] followed the group out after seeing them leave. The Empress at noon spoke to [Prince]. Holding the Eye of the Sky, [Prince] continued with the introduction.
0:11:42|0:11:52|The master of the language family [Xue Lie] had just finished speaking when he suddenly appeared in front of the [Prince]. At this moment, the three of [Feng Xiao] also arrived in time, and the playful [Prince] chuckled at the scene.
0:12:1|0:12:17|[Xue Lie] sneered coldly, then suddenly extended six damaged bones from his back. Following closely, [Hei Yu] also began to twist off bones, revealing a pair of incredibly large wings in front of everyone. Unexpectedly, [Xue Lie] was using the shoulder bones on the wings to stab the guests in the abdomen.
0:12:17|0:12:22|In an instant, the guests desperately scattered and fled, but the ruthless [Xue Lie] stabbed each of them to death.
0:12:23|0:12:36|At this moment, the [Prince] crawled on the ground with the treasure in hand, ready to escape. Unexpectedly, [Xue Lie] suddenly flung the queen's body in front of him. Although the [Prince] was usually indifferent, seeing his lover die in front of him made him stand up in anger.
0:12:36|0:12:47|Unfortunately, the power gap between the two was too great. [Xue Lie] pierced through the [Prince's] scapula with bone spurs and firmly pinned him to the wall. [Xue Lie] reached out and took the Sky Eye from the Prince's hand, saying, "..."
0:13:2|0:13:14|The next morning, the general who learned of the matter rode through the bustling city on a fast horse, heading straight to the palace of the [Emperor]. The palace of the [Emperor] was located next to a mountain, towering up to a hundred meters high. Against the backdrop of the mountain peak, its grandeur appeared particularly extravagant.
0:13:14|0:13:21|The general entered the city, waving flags on a fast horse, walking alone through the small path, then taking a wind ladder like an elevator to finally arrive in front of the [Emperor].
0:14:15|0:14:24|[Yang Zhenhu] heard the order, listened to his subordinates while pushing open the gates of the Prince's mansion. Inside, corpses were scattered everywhere. At that moment, his men discovered [Hei Yu] sneaking behind him.
0:14:40|0:14:46|Facing the pushing from Tiger Tooth, [Fei Long] naturally didn't say a word, and quickly put his own people on the ground.
0:15:20|0:15:32|At the same time, [Ni Kongkong], who learned the news in the underground palace that day, had already arrived at the Spirit Mountain with Ou Ka. A huge stone sculpture stood on this Spirit Mountain, with a cave at its foot.
0:15:42|0:15:59|Afterwards, [Ni Kongkong] opened the stone door of the secret passage and forcefully turned the switch. A bronze mirror slowly appeared on the stone wall, reflecting sunlight deep into the bottom of the cave. With Eurka climbing on his back, [Ni Kongkong] grabbed the rope and slowly descended towards the bottom of the cave.
0:15:59|0:16:4|Halfway down the slide, [Ni Kongkong]'s right hand with the strange crack suddenly stung.
0:16:37|0:16:48|In the fading dust of the interaction, behind the stone wall is a carefully excavated cave. The walls of the cave are adorned with valuable fluorescent stones everywhere. [Ni Kongkong] exclaimed excitedly in an arrow-like manner.
0:16:53|0:17:9|He took out the hook lock and hung it on the wall, then excitedly took down the fluorescent stones on the wall one by one and put them into the cloth bag. He was enjoying the joy of getting rich when suddenly he felt a sharp pain in his right hand again. After taking off the glove, he found that the light from the crack in his right hand was unusually dazzling.
0:17:9|0:17:20|At this moment, he didn't even care about stealing the fluorescent stone. After staring at the crack for a long time, he seemed to sense a mysterious power. He looked up at the waterfall in front of him and then held out his palm towards the direction of the waterfall.
0:17:21|0:17:35|At this moment, a light similar to the crack in the palm also emanated from behind the waterfall. [Ni Kongkong] saw this and raised his palm above his head. Unexpectedly, he was instantly sucked into the mysterious light behind the waterfall.
0:17:35|0:17:46|Passing through the waterfall, it was only then that the mysterious light that could resonate with [Ni Kongkong]'s palm was seen, emanating from an iron box on a column. The closer to the iron box, the more [Ni Kongkong] could feel the mysterious power.
0:17:48|0:18:3|He clenched his teeth and exerted all his strength to hold the iron box in his palm in order to uncover the secret hidden in it. Miraculously, the light on the iron box was absorbed by [Ni Kongkong] when it touched the cracks in his palm. However, he still couldn't learn the truth about the cracks and the iron box.
0:18:3|0:18:12|At this moment, [Feng Xiao] arrived at the bottom of the cave with two feathered guards, while [Ni Kongkong] was still unaware and desperately trying to smash open the iron box with a stone.
0:18:23|0:18:37|Ni Kongkong dodged two crossbow arrows directly shot at him, Feng Xiao walked over slowly and said. Ni Kongkong cleverly placed the box on the ground and kicked it towards Feng Xiao. At this moment, Okka ran to Ni Kongkong's side.
0:18:57|0:19:9|[Ni Kongkong] took advantage of the enemy's confusion, quickly threw a smoke bomb, knocking out the guards, then grabbed a crossbow and shot at [Feng Xiao]. Unexpectedly, [Feng Xiao] rebounded the crossbow back. At this moment, [Hei Yu] suddenly appeared and saved [Ni Kongkong].
0:19:32|0:19:48|[Ni Kongkong] suddenly launched an attack, kicking Okka towards [Feng Xiao], followed by a punch straight to the face. However, such tricks were ineffective in front of [Feng Xiao]. With a backhand move, he knocked [Ni Kongkong] to the ground. Just as [Feng Xiao] swung his sword towards [Ni Kongkong], [Hei Yu] timely blocked his attack.
0:19:48|0:19:55|Rescued [Ni Kongkong] quickly took Ou Ka to a corner, watching the siblings fight fiercely, but after a few moves, [Hei Yu] was no match for [Feng Xiao].
0:19:57|0:20:8|Just as [Feng Xiao] was about to leave with the box, Ou Ka rushed over and casually knocked the box out of his hand. In frustration, [Feng Xiao] forcefully pushed Ou Ka aside, and the iron box happened to land in front of [Hei Yu].
0:20:24|0:20:29|Ni Kongkong, the box instantly released the maximum energy, sending the two flying and bouncing next to [Ni Kongkong].
0:20:57|0:21:14|The Tiger Teeth scattered, forming a encirclement. Ni Gonggong, seeing the situation, tried to run, but was blocked by [Yang Zhenhu].
0:21:32|0:21:52|At this moment, [Feng Xiao] broke free from two tiger guards and fled swiftly. As for who [Ni Kongkong] was, [Hei Yu] didn't care. Instead, he walked up to [Ni Kongkong], reached into his clothes and pulled out a metal box, saying to [Yang Zhenhu].
0:22:5|0:22:23|Amidst the laughter of the crowd, [Hei Yu] and [Ni Kongkong] were locked in a labor car by the Tiger Tooth gang and escorted back to the city. [Yang Zhenhu] held a high position among the common people. The lively and crowded street suddenly became quiet as [Yang Zhenhu]'s troops arrived. People quickly moved aside and bowed respectfully to the troops.
0:22:23|0:22:28|Ni Kongkong, who was in the labor vehicle, looked at the people with a smile, and then said to Hei Yu.
0:23:28|0:23:55|Soon after, Ni Kongkong and Hei Yu were locked up in the dungeon and chained together. The two were too engrossed in their conversation to notice that the key to the cell had been stolen. The dungeon was too narrow, and they were very close to each other. Ni Kongkong looked at Hei Yu, who had a friendly face, and said softly.
0:24:6|0:24:17|During the fight between Ni Kongkong and Hei Yu, the prince of Tiandu City, He Li, opened the door and jumped in.
0:24:34|0:24:41|Hei Yu's fight with Ni Kongkong left him in excruciating pain. He watched as the two fought relentlessly, the sea appearing calm.
0:25:17|0:25:19|[Ni Kongkong] looked at [He Ying]'s jade pendant and said.
0:25:57|0:26:7|Soon after, [Ni Kongkong] whispered his perfect plan to the two of them. At the same time, deep in the mountains outside the Heavenly Capital City, Xue Lie looked at Feng Xiao, who had never missed a shot, and said.
0:27:27|0:27:37|Ouka dug a small hole in the dungeon wall and stole the box, handing it to [Ni Kongkong]. [Ni Kongkong] looked at [Hei Yu] who was injured, wanting to help stop the bleeding.
0:27:42|0:28:1|Knowing Ni Kongkong's intentions, Hei Yu also let go. Having just woken up, he looked at the already opened iron chains, feeling somewhat incredulous. At this moment, Ni Kongkong sat on the ground, took off her boots, and took out hemostatic medicine from them, preparing to apply it to Hei Yu. But as soon as she reached out, she was hit by Hei Yu again.
0:28:8|0:28:22|[Ni Kongkong] sniffed the medicine bag and frowned, then sniffed his own boots and awkwardly chuckled. Despite saying it was disgusting, [Hei Yu] had to take [Ni Kongkong]'s hemostatic medicine as the blood kept flowing out.
0:28:22|0:28:30|[Ni Kongkong] applied medicine and bandaged [Hei Yu]'s wound, but his restless hands opened Hei Yu's clothes, revealing the puncture marks where wings were about to grow on the winged man.
0:28:40|0:28:51|[Ni Kongkong] sat on the side, unhappily throwing the empty medicine packet on the ground. Seeing this, [Hei Yu] ignored him and closed his eyes to rest. At this moment, [Ni Kongkong] asked [Hei Yu] next to him again.
0:29:16|0:29:22|The two locked eyes for a long time, [Hei Yu] looked at [Ni Kongkong] with a particularly determined gaze, and then spoke to her.
0:29:49|0:29:58|Hei Yu attacked two prisoners and stripped off their clothes to disguise himself as Huya. He then swaggered out of the prison with the two prisoners in tow.
0:30:32|0:30:38|At this moment, Xue Lie's subordinates disguised as Tiger Fangs, escorted Lei Bao and others into the Zhenhu Office.
0:31:8|0:31:12|Just as they turned the corner into the dungeon, [Lei Bao] and his group ran into [Ni Kongkong] and her three companions.
0:31:29|0:31:47|The two groups of people were getting closer, both feeling a bit scared because of their disguises. Leading the way, [Ni Kongkong] and [Hei Yu] were walking with guilty consciences, keeping their heads down. [Ni Kongkong] caught a glimpse of the prisoner [Lei Bao], who had a strange and ugly appearance, triggering memories of that night at the Prince's mansion.
0:31:47|0:31:51|[Ni Kongkong] was not happy in his heart, but in order not to expose himself, he still apologized to the other party.
0:32:0|0:32:3|[Ni Kongkong] kept looking back from time to time.
0:32:13|0:32:18|[Hei Yu] saw Yang Zhenhu walking down the steps from the front and reached out to stop [Ni Kongkong].
0:32:48|0:33:3|Due to the sudden appearance of Yang Zhenhu, the three who were about to reach the door were forced to turn back and choose the small path to move forward. At the same time, the group of [Lei Bao] who infiltrated Zhenhu Temple had already turned the administrative office upside down.
0:33:16|0:33:21|The progress of Ni Kongkong, Hei Yu, and Xue Lie on the small path was not smooth, as they encountered a large number of guards ahead.
0:33:26|0:33:30|[Hei Yu] shook his head, and [Ni Kongkong], seeing this, pondered for a moment before speaking.
0:33:54|0:34:7|[Ni Kongkong]’s perfect plan turned out to be using herself to lure away the guards on the wind stairs, thus covering the escape of the two. Seeing dozens of guards chasing after [Ni Kongkong], the two couldn’t waste the opportunity, so after locking eyes, they rushed towards the wind stairs.
0:34:7|0:34:15|In the dim light, just as the reinforcements arrived, a guard shot off He Li's helmet with an arrow. Luckily, Hei Yu was extraordinary and quickly took care of him.
0:34:24|0:34:48|The guard quickly sounded the alarm gong, and [Yang Zhenhu] arrived at the scene. Hearing the gong in the administrative office, they hurriedly reported to [Lei Bao]. Upon waking up, [Lei Bao] immediately took out his iron giant axe, looking solemnly at the gate. His subordinates also stopped flipping their palms and each took out their weapons to stand by.
0:34:51|0:35:8|The door was pushed open by Ni Kongkong with great force. Lei Bao, seeing only one unarmed person, felt somewhat puzzled. After a moment, dozens of guards rushed to the office, and when they caught up to the door, they were also startled by Lei Bao and his companions.
0:35:18|0:35:32|[Lei Bao] wasted no time in summoning the giant tiger, and the iron chain also emerged from the axe handle. [Ni Kongkong] swiftly leaped up and shot out a flying rope from his sleeve, dodging this deadly blow. However, the three guards behind him were not so lucky, as they were all sent flying by the giant tiger.
0:35:34|0:35:51|With the active attack from [Lei Bao], the battle between the two groups officially began. Suddenly, the lineup room seemed to have turned into a chaotic battlefield, with various documents and letters flying everywhere. [Lei Bao] almost wiped out the experienced warriors with his giant axe. [Ni Kongkong] also joined the battle.
0:35:51|0:36:2|Just as he was fighting fiercely, the box in his arms accidentally fell to the ground from the second floor. The crisp sound caught the attention of [Lei Bao]. Just as he was about to pounce on the box, [Ni Kongkong] picked it up first.
0:36:7|0:36:14|[Lei Bao] threw a huge axe, knocking [Ni Kongkong] down from the stairs. Just then, [Yang Zhenhu] arrived in time with a long-handled knife.
0:36:17|0:36:25|[Yang Zhenhu] rushed forward with the guards as soon as he came to life. With his exceptional martial arts skills, he turned the tide the moment he joined the battle.
0:36:25|0:36:35|Just now the arrogant and domineering Feathered Man has been killed one by one by [Yang Zhenhu], while [Lei Bao] completely disregards the lives of his subordinates, only chasing after [Ni Kongkong], trying to snatch back what was given to him.
0:36:36|0:36:47|[Ni Kongkong] was closely pursued by [Lei Bao], from the second floor to the first floor, and then from the first floor to the corridor. [Ni Kongkong] could only rely on the hook on his body, awkwardly shuttling up and down the corridor, trying to shake off [Lei Bao].
0:36:47|0:37:0|[Yang Zhenhu] joined the battle and quickly eliminated a soldier, then headed straight for [Lei Bao]. Gasping for breath, [Ni Kongkong] saw [Yang Zhenhu] approaching and immediately pulled herself together, no longer looking as disheveled as before, provocatively staring at [Lei Bao].
0:37:0|0:37:16|[Lei Bao], true to his name, has a particularly violent temper. Seeing [Ni Kongkong] mocking him, he swung his axe and aimed a blow at her head. Fortunately, [Yang Zhenhu] intervened in time, using the handle of his knife to drag [Ni Kongkong] aside. The force of the axe strike also cracked open a crevice in the stone wall.
0:37:16|0:37:20|[Yang Zhenhu] was surprised by the strength of [Lei Bao] and did not dare to underestimate him.
0:37:20|0:37:39|Taking a fighting stance, [Lei Bao] was naturally fearless, greeting whoever came with a giant axe. At that moment, the box in [Ni Kongkong]'s arms fell to the ground, catching [Lei Bao]'s eyes. Instantly losing the will to fight, [Lei Bao] was only thinking about how to get the box. He simply exchanged a few moves with [Yang Zhenhu].
0:37:39|0:37:56|Possessing the desire to pick up the box, [Yang Zhenhu] seized the opportunity and kicked [Lei Bao]'s head against the wall. The box that was just within reach flew out again, but was intercepted by [Yang Zhenhu] with a knife. Unexpectedly, [Ni Kongkong] suddenly snatched the box and dashed out of the corridor. Upon seeing this, [Lei Bao] immediately got up to chase after, but [Yang Zhenhu] relentlessly pursued.
0:37:56|0:38:9|So, after [Lei Bao] walked out of the corridor, he turned back and chopped off the stone pillar, trapping [Yang Zhenhu] under the falling boulder. On the other side, [Hei Yu] and the other person printed the closed guards one by one on the ground, [He Ying] stepped onto the sealed ladder, and said urgently.
0:38:45|0:38:56|As soon as [Hei Yu] finished speaking, in the dim light, [Lei Bao]'s flying axe smashed in from the top of the ladder, firmly hooking onto it, and [Lei Bao] used an iron chain to continuously rotate the ladder downwards.
0:38:57|0:39:9|[Hei Yu] spoke, and the three of them flipped to the top of the ladder. [Hei Yu] saw [Ni Kongkong] and He Li, grabbed the ascending rope tightly. The mutated knife cut it off, without the traction of the rope, [Ou Xi] instantly walked towards [Lei Bao].
0:39:9|0:39:22|[Ou Xi] fell from high altitude, directly submerging [Lei Bao], and the three quickly arrived at the top of Zhenhu Si. Holding iron hooks, they slid rapidly on a zip line to another high building.
0:39:33|0:39:49|Outside the Zhenhu Temple, after seeing Ni Kongkong and the others escaping, Hei Yu climbed down from the wall and joined the crowd in chasing after them. At that moment, Yang Zhenhu, who had just been rescued, arrived with his team, only to watch the three already escaped individuals and angrily shouted.
0:39:52|0:40:5|After escaping, the group stole a boat from the shore and headed towards the direction of the underground cave at night. The next morning, they had already drifted to the outskirts of the cave. The mountain peaks here were covered with giant monster stone sculptures, sending shivers down their spines.
0:42:12|0:42:23|Night fell in the blink of an eye, and the small boat carrying three people continued to move slowly in the river. [Hei Yu] couldn't sleep, sitting alone at the bow, lost in thought as he gazed at the necklace. At that moment, [Ni Kongkong] emerged from the cabin and asked.
0:42:45|0:43:13|[Hei Yu] anxiously tried to snatch back the necklace and resorted to using force. [Ni Kongkong] jumped onto the sail, and without hesitation, [Hei Yu] immediately pounced on her. In the midst of the fight, [Hei Yu] pulled off [Ni Kongkong]'s glove, revealing the secret of her identity. Angered and embarrassed, [Ni Kongkong] walked towards [Hei Yu].
0:43:19|0:43:37|[Ni Kongkong] initially wanted to snatch back the boxing gloves, then changed his cute image from before, and his punches became heavier. He lifted [Hei Yu] with force and threw him onto the boat. However, [Hei Yu] was stronger than him, locking his neck with his foot and throwing him out. Getting up again, [Ni Kongkong] angrily threw the necklace onto the boat.
0:43:40|0:43:48|Unexpectedly, the necklace was broken. [Hei Yu], strong and furious, leaped into the air and almost kicked [Ni Kongkong] off the ship.
0:43:53|0:43:59|[Hei Yu] rushed towards the necklace, and at that moment, the necklace emitted a tremendous amount of energy, rising up into the air.
0:44:4|0:44:18|The necklace rose into the air, and brilliant pollen poured out from the broken part like the Milky Way, surrounding the necklace. [Ni Kongkong] tightly held onto the ship's edge, struggling to climb onto the ship, but [Hei Yu] paid no attention to him at all.
0:44:18|0:44:35|At that moment, the floating star pollen surrounded [Hei Yu] in mid-air and drilled into his wing orifice. A huge surge of energy rushed in, causing [Hei Yu] to faint instantly on the ground. Seeing this, [Ni Kongkong] hurried forward. The necklace lost its power and fell on the boat.
0:44:35|0:44:47|[Ni Kongkong] picked it up and when he turned around again, the unconscious [Hei Yu] was rising vertically into the air under the effect of star stream pollen. [Ni Kongkong] grabbed his ankle, but the powerful energy sent the two of them flying together.
0:45:1|0:45:9|[Fei Long] followed Wu Ka's gaze and saw that the two of them had already soared to a height of several tens of meters.
0:45:20|0:45:35|As the two ascended higher and higher, [Ni Kongkong] tightly wrapped her arms around [Hei Yu]'s legs, wailing incessantly. At that moment, the starflower pollen completely merged with [Hei Yu], and a pair of large wings extended from his back. Seeing this, [Ni Kongkong] was so shocked that she couldn't speak.
0:45:35|0:45:54|After a moment, [Hei Yu] also gradually regained consciousness. When he opened his eyes, he found himself in the air hundreds of meters above the ground, instantly panicking. Seeing the wings behind him, he was even more confused. He frantically tried to control the wings, but being his first flight, he couldn't coordinate the flapping of both wings at the same frequency in his panic.
0:45:59|0:46:15|Both plummeting rapidly, [Ni Kongkong] found a way in the midst of chaos. He struggled to slide towards [Hei Yu], and after many twists and turns, finally managed to lie on [Hei Yu]'s back. With both hands tightly gripping [Hei Yu]'s wings, [Ni Kongkong] then exerted all his strength to push backwards, finally helping [Hei Yu] successfully spread his wings.
0:46:16|0:46:33|Being shaken out by the wings, he was lucky to shoot out a grappling hook in time, tethering himself to [Hei Yu]'s ankle as they fell from the sky to the canyon. [Hei Yu], who had just gained control of his wings, was still practicing flying diligently.
0:46:34|0:46:54|Ni Kongkong was completely unaware that she was already in the midst of a hallucinatory and dangerous jungle. The jungle was extremely fantastical, filled with colorful bubbles everywhere. Hei Yu, after passing through the jungle, suddenly realized that he was about to crash into the mountaintop, prompting him to fly up, but still ended up crashing into a tree on the mountaintop. Fortunately, both of them were unharmed. After a fantastical night.
0:46:54|0:47:6|[Ni Kongkong] looked weary. He lit a fire on the side to rest, while [Hei Yu], who had just grown wings, was particularly spirited. After a brief rest, they continued practicing flying in the air.
0:47:22|0:47:40|[Hei Yu] witnessed, grabbed the wine jug, took a big gulp and choked on it. The strong liquor made [Hei Yu] cough, rendering him speechless for a while. He wiped his mouth and sat down on a nearby rock next to [Ni Kongkong].
0:47:40|0:47:48|At this moment, [Ni Kongkong] also approached and took out the broken necklace from his pocket to hand it to [Hei Yu].
0:48:54|0:49:1|Ni Kongkong took out the box and shook it in his palm. Every time the box passed through the cracks in his palm, it would shine brightly.
0:49:59|0:50:11|[Hei Yu] hooked onto [Ni Kongkong]'s belt with a grappling hook, before he could react, he was already flying towards the herding boat. The next morning, [He Ying] asked [Ni Kongkong], where did those two fly off to again?
0:50:24|0:50:37|Just as [Ni Kongkong] was about to get angry, he was teased and signaled [He Ying] to be alive. A graceful figure with wings landed on the boat. It turned out that [Hei Yu] went to investigate and introduced himself to the two.
0:50:44|0:50:58|Unconsciously, the small boat sailed into a mysterious cave. The river flowed through the narrow cave, and a strange wind blew out from the depths of the cave. It wasn't until they approached that the group noticed a small island in the cave, where the people on the island were living in peace, but without joy.
0:50:58|0:51:6|The simple instruments played lively tunes, the bonfire flickered, the beauty swayed her waist, and the strong men enjoyed fine wine, as people from all walks of life gathered here.
0:51:45|0:51:50|The three of them started to act separately. On the other side, inside the mansion of [Jiang Chengzi].
0:51:54|0:51:57|[Hei Yu] took away a treasure.
0:52:8|0:52:30|At the same time, the underground casino was bustling with noise and excitement, but danger was quietly approaching. Countless [Fei Long] from the [Hei Yu] clan were crossing through the mountain caves and tunnels, heading straight to the underground casino. The reveling gamblers in the casino were shouting wildly, completely unaware of the impending threat.
0:52:37|0:52:41|The lively host at the casino announced the results of the gambling round.
0:52:47|0:52:58|[Ni Kongkong], holding a glass of wine, somehow joined in. Through the stone window, [Ni Kongkong] unexpectedly saw the evil dragon. Just as he was about to provoke it, he was pulled back by someone.
0:53:1|0:53:7|After speaking, he raised his head and shouted loudly. Faced with He Lu's questioning, [Hei Yu] turned around to leave.
0:53:25|0:53:34|Hei Yu kicked He Lie away on the spot, He Lie, unwilling to accept it, rushed up to fight back, but was kicked down again by Hei Yu. Ni Kongkong rushed over to stop He Lie.
0:53:49|0:54:11|In the crowd, a beggar saw this scene, walked towards the outside, came to the corridor bridge, took out the cloth bag around his waist, and before he could open it, he was pressed down by [Hei Yu]. [Hei Yu] took the cloth bag, the pangolin knocked down the beggar, then [Ni Kongkong] delivered a stick blow, smashing him off the bridge. He Li walked over and stepped on the beggar's chest.
0:54:11|0:54:15|[Hei Yu] leaped off the bridge and rolled up the beggar's sleeve, revealing strange tattoos inside.
0:54:23|0:54:49|Hei Yu finished speaking, disdainfully stood up. Ni Kongkong walked over and separated the two confronting each other. Hei Yu, who was unwilling to accept it, had to give up. It turned out that behind the casino, there was a dark prison cell where vines and rubble were scattered around. The monster's roar frightened Hei Yu.
0:54:49|0:54:58|Three people moved forward and found that the prisoners were all chained to the hollowed-out stones. They approached.
0:55:2|0:55:20|[Hei Yu] quickly squatted down and gently patted Lao Yuan. Lao Yuan made a nine-square, with an indescribable smell. Just as the three were about to open the iron chain, an accident occurred. Tian Qian's soldier was attacked by a huge tiger, but was dodged by [Ni Kongkong].
0:55:20|0:55:26|The soldier rushed towards [Ge Li], but [Hei Yu] leaped and kicked the enemy against the wall, as [Ni Kongkong] charged forward.
0:55:31|0:55:50|Enemies attacked again, and Ni Kongkong swiftly used a scissor kick to subdue one of them. As another enemy prepared to strike, he was knocked down by Hei Yu. With more enemies closing in, Fei Long picked up a sword from the ground and used techniques like "Immortal's Guidance" and "Looking Back at the Moon" to defeat them, allowing the remaining soldiers to regroup and fight back.
0:55:50|0:55:56|In the crowd, a bald figure in a long robe with strange tattoos on his head walked over.
0:56:1|0:56:11|The bald monster shouted and threw off his long robe, dancing in a comical manner towards [Hei Yu]. [Hei Yu] immediately drew his sword, and [Ni Kongkong] approached.
0:56:29|0:56:34|The bald man pushed Ni Kongkong again.
0:56:52|0:56:59|[Ni Kongkong] was just about to speak when he was pushed aside by the bald man. The bald man turned around and walked up to [Hei Yu] with a serious expression on his face.
0:57:42|0:57:55|[Ni Kongkong] and [Hei Yu] both turned to Ge Li at the same time. Ge Li was taken aback and opened his hands. [Hei Yu] and [Ni Kongkong] nodded in agreement.
0:58:2|0:58:9|Speak up, the bald man and his men leave. With only Old Li and two others left, [Ni Kongkong] turns around and walks unsteadily towards [Hei Yu].
0:58:11|0:58:34|[Hei Yu] looked annoyed. On the other side, the bald man was holding a glass of wine and accompanied by a small pig teammate. As he raised his head to drink, he was suddenly pushed from behind. The bald man turned around angrily, only to see [Hei Yu] in a charming long dress.
0:59:1|0:59:7|[Hei Yu] angrily washed the dishes, causing the bald man to tremble underneath the light, before realizing after a while that this was his own territory.
0:59:8|0:59:26|So [Baldy] stood up, picked up his pants and grabbed the wine jug, only to find that the jug had been emptied at some point. [Baldy] stood up and went back to refill the wine, [Hei Yu] anxiously looked back at [Ni Kongkong], the two exchanged glances, but were caught red-handed by [Baldy].
0:59:34|0:59:54|[Hei Yu] twisted [Ni Kongkong]'s wrist just as he was about to step forward. His men, who were about to help, were ordered back by [Ni Kongkong]. He awkwardly rubbed his head and smiled at [Hei Yu]. Seeing this, his men lowered their guard and retreated. [Ni Kongkong] spoke to the cold and elegant [Hei Yu] again.
1:0:16|1:0:34|Hei Yu untied the cloth bag and a strange bug with a look of emotion flew out, flapping its wings a few times before flying away. Hei Yu had done something guilty, so he returned to the room to find his teammates, looking around nervously, afraid of being discovered. Seeing Ni Kongkong still in place, he quietly sat down, while Lei Bao had already been tricked into drinking several pots of green wine.
1:0:39|1:0:42|[Guangtou] forcefully pushed another wine pot into [Hei Yu]'s arms.
1:0:48|1:1:6|Ni Kongkong in front of the table was getting anxious. The bald man looked at the enchanting figure, the swaying wine pot, and excitedly hummed a song. Hei Yu finished in one breath, smashed the wine pot, feeling like throwing up. Hei Yu ran away, and the bald man chased after him relentlessly.
1:1:15|1:1:30|Ni Kongkong suddenly became angrier. His men behind him were once again ordered to step back, leaving only Hei Yu sitting on a rock staring at the complete jade pendant. Unaware, he was quietly approached by Ni Kongkong, whose eyes were drawn to the jade pendant. Hei Yu turned around and was startled.
1:1:33|1:1:37|On the other side, [Hei Yu], supported by [Ni Kongkong], is helping a rabbit by leaning against the wall.
1:2:34|1:2:36|Later, he was dismissed from his position for his lecherous and greedy behavior.
1:2:46|1:3:0|On the other side, drunk [Hei Yu] started to go crazy and wanted to fight with the bald guy, but [Ni Kongkong] couldn't stop him. Some soldiers took the opportunity to attack, [Ni Kongkong] quickly pulled [Hei Yu] close and took a hit for him.
1:3:3|1:3:14|Fei Yu's actions were like a fuse, igniting the entire Earth dance party. People from all walks of life sought revenge, but He Ying remained calm. Fei Yu arrived.
1:3:24|1:3:43|Ni Kongkong saw Hei Yu kneeling on the ground, tightly hugging Xue Lie. The atmosphere suddenly became tense, and Hei Yu thought he had broken through the defenses of the two. Xue Lie smiled to ease the tension, while Jiang Chengzi, Ni Kongkong's Feng Xiao, took the opportunity to stand up. Ni Kongkong blocked Hei Yu's eyes.
1:3:43|1:3:48|The guards arrived late on the mountain, facing [Ni Kongkong] and [Hei Yu] with their swords drawn.
1:3:55|1:3:58|[Jiang Chengzi] stepped forward and patted his shoulder.
1:4:13|1:4:16|[Jiang Chengzi] turned around as he was about to leave, then suddenly turned back to start explaining.
1:4:20|1:4:28|[Hei Yu] was so frightened that her face turned pale and she interrupted on the spot. [Jiang Chengzi] didn't say much either, and left first. [Ni Kongkong] asked in disbelief.
1:4:33|1:4:42|[Ni Kongkong] was a little afraid to look directly at Hei Yu. Hei Yu walked up and was about to reach out to touch [Ni Kongkong]'s shoulder.
1:4:51|1:5:0|After speaking, [Hei Yu] dragged the drunken [Hei Yu] and ran away. Liu Xiahe stood there in a daze. Lao Yuan was awakened by a bucket of water and sighed discontentedly.
1:5:5|1:5:7|[Hei Yu], dressed in new clothes, ran over.
1:5:14|1:5:32|[Ni Kongkong] squatted down and took out the treasure. Lao Yuan straightened it out, took the treasure box, carefully examined it in his hand, and looked at the patterns on it with some familiarity. The group followed Lao Yuan to the residence, which was intricate and complex inside.
1:5:37|1:5:40|Several people leaped into the depths of the stone cave and discovered a hidden paradise.
1:6:24|1:6:33|[Ni Kongkong] decisively opened the huge ancient book, stirring up a cloud of dust, as several people gathered around to read the parchment book.
1:6:43|1:6:56|Lao Yuan inserted it into the bottom of the treasure chest and gently turned it. The mechanism of the treasure chest was triggered, and the light ball inside evoked neon-like memories.
1:7:9|1:7:27|During the war between humans and giants, [Hei Yu] slaughtered the Jiao tribe, obtaining the Jiao Pearl and the golden disc, which could open the Eye of the Sky and summon thousands of dark and terrifying flying demons.
1:7:39|1:8:2|The Human Emperor dispatched a warrior to infiltrate the Sky City. When the Gel Bead once again emitted light, the warrior risked his life to seize it. The human army, together with the kind Feathered People, took advantage of the situation and defeated [Feather Emperor]. The Gel Bead was sealed, and the warrior disappeared from then on.
1:8:29|1:8:37|Why is it that every time my hand gets close, Lao Yuan grabs [Ni Kongkong]'s hand just as I'm about to examine it? Suddenly, there was a commotion outside the stone cave.
1:8:39|1:8:51|[Hei Yu] pulled out a dagger and stabbed it directly into the gel bead, but the gel bead, along with the box, shook violently, breaking the dagger in [Hei Yu]'s hand. [Hei Yu] had to close the box first and prepare to deal with the enemy.
1:9:7|1:9:16|A gust of cold wind extinguished the sparks in the cave. With long hair and armor, [Feng Xiao] descended from the sky, looking down on everyone. [Hei Yu] was surprised.
1:9:40|1:9:55|[Xue Lie] immediately drew his sword and initiated a confrontation. [Xue Lie] grabbed the blade and kicked it away. Feng attacked with dual blades, only to be blocked by [Jiang Chengzi]. Feng then kicked [Jiang Chengzi] away. Meanwhile, [Xue Lie] charged towards [Hei Yu], prompting [Ni Kongkong] to quickly throw a smoke bomb and escape with [Hei Yu].
1:9:55|1:10:1|On the other side, Hei Yu was locked in a fierce battle, while Ni Kongkong fainted. Not long after escaping, they were intercepted by the flapping wings of Xue Lie.
1:10:3|1:10:15|Ni Kongkong flew to kick, but was smashed back by Xue Lie's punch, Hei Yu stabbed with a sword, but was skillfully caught by Xue Lie, then punched in the abdomen and flew out, Emperor ran over to hold Xue Lie.
1:10:15|1:10:29|[Lao Yuan] kicked the whole pot into the stone cave mechanism, [Hei Yu] and others took the opportunity to escape. [Xue Lie] was about to pounce on [Lao Yuan] and kick him away, but [Lao Yuan] took the opportunity to escape through the hole. At the same time, [Feng Xiao] didn't take advantage under [He Ying]'s hand, and when he saw [Xue Lie] approaching, he stepped forward to take the command.
1:10:33|1:10:52|Here, [Hei Yu] and [Ni Kongkong] use a mechanism to arrive in a stone well. [Ni Kongkong] shoots a grappling hook into the air, while [Hei Yu] flaps his wings to take off, freeing themselves from the predicament. Xuelie makes a move, knocking down [Jiang Chengzi]'s henchmen with three punches and two kicks. Herli and [Jiang Chengzi] arrive late.
1:11:2|1:11:13|Hei Yu wielded his sword, Xue Lie leaped up, dodged and then sneaked into Hei Yu's wrist, kicked him away with one foot, turning into a steel field, and was kicked into the air by Xue Lie.
1:11:13|1:11:26|[Feng Xiao] kicked out with both feet, kicking [Hei Yu] away, then turned around and kicked the crossbeam, which hit the top of the stone cave. The top immediately checked his whereabouts, hanging on the hook of the wind on the stone cave, causing [Ni Kongkong] to fall into the top of the cave without any movement.
1:11:29|1:11:34|In the new episode, [Hei Yu] leaps over [Feng Xiao]'s attack and arrives at the top of the cave.
1:11:50|1:12:3|[Feng Xiao] leaped towards [Hei Yu], but unexpectedly, [Hei Yu] spread his wings and flew away. Unwilling to give up, [Feng Xiao] leaped onto a stone gate, then threw himself off the gate, grabbing onto the flying [Hei Yu] and dragging him to the ground, holding his neck tightly.
1:12:5|1:12:9|[Hei Yu] counterattacks with a swing, [Feng Xiao] feels a sudden alert in his heart, striking fiercely at [Hei Yu]'s wing orifice.
1:12:36|1:12:53|[Hei Yu] embraced [Feng Xiao] and together they plunged off the cliff, falling into the lake below. While [Feng Xiao] struggled to reach the surface, [Hei Yu] refused to let go. Soon, they reached the surface of the lake, where [Feng Xiao] grabbed onto a swaying hemp rope and reached out to grab [Hei Yu] by the neck.
1:12:54|1:13:7|[Hei Yu] widened his eyes in disbelief. As [Feng Xiao] tightened the hemp rope in his hands, [Hei Yu] gradually couldn't hold on anymore, opening his mouth as the lake water rushed in. The hemp rope around his neck was pulled tight by [Feng Xiao], causing [Hei Yu] to close his eyes and pass out.
1:13:7|1:13:16|[Feng Xiao] searched [Hei Yu] and found a box. After getting the box, [Feng Xiao] ignored the unconscious [Hei Yu] and left directly.
1:13:21|1:13:41|[Xue Lie] grabbed [Hei Yu] by the neck with one hand until he lost consciousness. With the other hand, he forcefully pushed him towards the edge, causing [Hei Yu] to be thrown and hit a stone pillar. The stones collapsed, and the insect formation rushed directly towards [Hei Yu], covering him. The huge rocks stirred up clouds of dust, and [Xue Lie] watched this scene calmly.
1:13:51|1:14:1|[Xue Lie] smiled satisfactorily, while [Hei Yu] sank to the bottom of the lake, completely losing consciousness. He closed his eyes tightly, and there was no expression on his once lively face.
1:14:6|1:14:28|He swam down with all his strength to save the most important person in his life. [Ni Kongkong] gently tapped [Hei Yu]'s cheek on the shore. The unconscious [Hei Yu] suddenly coughed up some water from the river. [Hei Yu] slowly opened his eyes.
1:14:37|1:14:46|Upon hearing this, [Hei Yu] immediately struggled to get up. [Ni Kongkong] looked at [Hei Yu] in surprise. [Hei Yu] leaped up, ready to fly, but fell down before spreading his wings.
1:14:59|1:15:8|Hei Yu was struggling to move [Jiang Chengzi] from under the pile of rocks, [Jiang Chengzi] who was seriously injured seemed to be on the brink of collapse. Hei Yu hurried forward.
1:15:18|1:15:28|[Ni Kongkong] and [Hei Yu] rushed over upon hearing the noise, with [Ge Li] investigating the situation of [Jiang Chengzi]. Angry [Ni Kongkong] grabbed Hei Yu by the neck and pressed him down in front of Jiang Chengzi's body.
1:16:29|1:16:32|Ge Li picked up the sword to leave, but was stopped by [Ni Kongkong].
1:16:38|1:16:44|[Hei Yu] saw the passive [Ni Kongkong] and felt dissatisfied. [Ni Kongkong] dared not look [Hei Yu] in the eye, hesitated for a moment and said.
1:16:49|1:16:51|The companion on the side was somewhat surprised when he heard it.
1:18:1|1:18:16|Hei Yu retreated with a grimace, unwillingly. Ni Kongkong turned around, looking at the mess on the ground, feeling endless sorrow in her heart. The so-called friendship turned into a bubble. In the dark and windy night, a small boat with a flickering light drifted on the river. Hei Yu on the boat struggled to pull the sail.
1:18:18|1:18:33|[Hei Yu] came to the side of the boat, and He Li saw [Hei Yu] approaching, unconsciously stopping the movement in her hands. The two locked eyes for a moment, and He Li went back to work. [Hei Yu] walked forward and accidentally kicked a small water bottle, which belonged to [Ni Kongkong].
1:18:33|1:18:44|[Hei Yu] hesitated for a moment, bent down to pick it up, while [Jiang Chengzi] brushed past [Hei Yu]'s black hair. Meanwhile, [Ge Li] secured the sail and looked back at the distant grotto. In her heart, she couldn't help but think of [Ni Kongkong].
1:18:47|1:19:3|[Jiang Chengzi] drifted downstream, getting farther and farther away, facing the black rain that blocked the way, standing alone at the bow of the boat without daring to look back, afraid of disturbing the melancholy in his heart. And so, the night quickly passed, the birdsong heralded the long-lost dawn, and morning mist rose on the great river.
1:19:4|1:19:18|[Hei Yu] finished washing up, paying great attention to his appearance. He brushed off the dust on his body and straightened his collar. After tidying up, he noticed the swaying wind chimes. He held the wind chimes with both hands, making them stop making any sound.
1:19:18|1:19:25|After stabilizing himself, he caught a glimpse of three [Fei Long] flying towards the small boat in the distance in the sky. He quickly shouted out loud.
1:19:43|1:19:53|[Hei Yu] listened and then turned his gaze to the person riding the dragon. As [Fei Long] flew closer and closer, [Hei Yu] and the others gradually saw clearly that the person riding the dragon was none other than the renowned Ming Honghong.
1:20:29|1:20:32|[Ni Kongkong] landed [Fei Long] on the shore and spoke to the two of them.
1:20:54|1:20:59|[Ni Kongkong] stared intently at [Hei Yu], but [Hei Yu] deliberately ignored him, then he spoke.
1:21:3|1:21:12|[Fei Long] immediately became extremely obedient. [Fei Long] immediately became extremely obedient. [Fei Long] immediately became extremely obedient. [Fei Long] immediately became extremely obedient. [Fei Long] immediately became extremely obedient.
1:21:33|1:21:38|[Hei Yu] said, "Mount [Fei Long] and go ahead first, with [Ni Kongkong] following closely behind."
1:21:45|1:21:49|And so, the three of them rode on [Fei Long] soaring in the clouds, shouting excitedly.
1:22:27|1:22:31|Ni Kongkong made a face at [Hei Yu] with a straight face and said.
1:22:52|1:23:5|The night in Tian Du City was brightly lit, from the palace to the streets, everyone was watching lanterns and various performances. The Emperor, distracted, watched the enchanting dance with the crowd, and after a moment, he whispered.
1:23:23|1:23:36|In the streets, festive lanterns were hung in front of every household. The people excitedly watched the parade floats performing on the sides of the street. Strong men vigorously beat the big drums, and everyone was immersed in the joy of the festival at that moment.
1:23:36|1:23:52|The parade of the performance show is very large, in addition to the floats, there are also acrobatics, dances, and more behind. But the most mysterious are a group of people wearing festive clothes and masks. They neither sing nor dance, just follow the parade and look around.
1:23:52|1:24:8|Following the departure, we followed all the way from the outskirts of the city to the gates of the [Emperor]. At the same time, a mysterious ritual was taking place in [Xue Lie]'s palace. After the priestess finished chanting, the infant began to move eerily. [Xue Lie] gathered all his subordinates and addressed them.
1:24:26|1:24:49|[Jiang Chengzi] said, and in the blink of an eye, he flew to the sky above the Heavenly Capital. After exchanging a smile with the mysterious person in the team, he flew towards the imperial palace with full determination. However, the mysterious person who received instructions took off his mask and drew his weapon, revealing himself to be [Feng Xiao] and his subordinates.
1:24:52|1:25:5|When the soldiers were discovered by [Feng Xiao], it was already too late. Holding two knives, he dealt with the oncoming soldiers as easily as cutting vegetables. He showed no desire for battle, and after dealing with the soldiers in front of him, he stood still facing the city gate with a spear in hand.
1:25:5|1:25:13|The powerful [Feng Xiao] astonishingly pushed open the city gate with his own strength, leading many feathered people to charge into the city.
1:25:16|1:25:29|At the same time, the palace was also in turmoil. Taking advantage of the parade performance, the elite assassination team had already climbed up the city wall with grappling hooks, easily dealt with the guards, and quietly made their way to the main hall.
1:25:29|1:25:47|At this moment, chaos erupted in the imperial city. The guards rushed towards the palace to rescue the Emperor. Just as the troops stepped onto the iron rope bridge, [Xue Lie] ignited the giant stones of the city walls, breaking the bridge directly and causing the rescue troops to fall down. On the grand hall, only a dozen or so of the Emperor's personal guards were struggling to hold on.
1:25:47|1:25:54|The situation is indeed critical, the Emperor himself had to draw his sword and join the battle with the generals.
1:26:37|1:26:45|Ni Kongkong, extremely excited, rushed forward to engage in a fight with [Hei Yu]. Meanwhile, [Yang Zhenhu], [Feng Xiao], and a few others arrived at the secret chamber of the palace.
1:26:47|1:26:59|[Xue Lie] flew to the front of the secret chamber door, retracted his wings behind him, then took out the stolen key, inserted it into the mechanism of the door, the heavy stone door slowly rose, [Xue Lie] and others with eager faces greeted the dream.
1:26:59|1:27:8|Just then, two cold arrows shot from behind [Xue Lie], [Xue Lie] quickly blocked them and rebounded the arrows back, [Yang Zhenhu] arrived with his men in time.
1:27:15|1:27:25|[Xue Lie] said, leading a few guards to walk elegantly towards the secret room, leaving [Feng Xiao] team and [Yang Zhenhu] to engage in fierce combat, during which the shadow warrior shot darts at the [Emperor].
1:27:30|1:27:44|At this moment, [Xue Lie] had already passed through the winding corridors of the secret chamber and arrived at the main hall. The hall was extremely dark, as was [Ni Kongkong], but the decorations around were exceptionally exquisite. The fine craftsmanship of various stone carvings indicated the former glory of this place.
1:27:44|1:27:59|[Xue Lie] seems to be very familiar with this place. He spread his wings and leaped to the stone pillar in the center of the hall, then embedded the Sky Eye he snatched from Prince Junwang Lake into the pillar. In an instant, a flash of light appeared above the pillar, but the real Sky Eye did not appear.
1:27:59|1:28:13|At this moment, Neon Palace and [Hei Yu] also arrived in front of the secret room door, leaping down from [Fei Long] to join the battle. Their arrival unintentionally gave [Yang Zhenhu]'s troops an extra boost. At this moment, Shadi's [Feng Xiao] saw [Hei Yu] and gritted his teeth, saying bitterly.
1:28:34|1:28:42|[Yang Zhenhu] was completely confused, but seeing Ni Honghong's anxious look, he followed him into the secret room. Just as the two of them entered, they were suddenly attacked by the enemy.
1:28:55|1:29:13|The two of them took care of the enemies in front of them and prepared to walk towards the main hall. At this moment, dozens of feathered people surrounded them. Seeing this, [Ni Kongkong] quickly told [Hei Yu] to hold his breath, and then Hei Yu let out a fart, causing many feathered people to faint directly. Outside the door, the improved [Hei Yu] and [Feng Xiao] were engaged in a fierce battle.
1:29:13|1:29:23|After a dozen exchanges, [Hei Yu] unexpectedly gained the upper hand, forcing [Feng Xiao] to defend himself and even pushing him to the edge of the city wall. Inside the palace, with the help of He Li, the situation was successfully turned around.
1:29:24|1:29:36|After eliminating the Feather Tribe soldiers, Hei Yu and the Emperor captured [He Ying] alive. [He Ying] was forced to surrender by throwing away her weapon. Meanwhile, Hei Yu accidentally kicked Feng Xiao onto the spikes on the city wall.
1:30:6|1:30:13|In the secret room, [Xue Lie] is preparing to open the fusion of the gel beads and the Eye of the Sky.
1:30:16|1:30:28|Ni Kongkong puzzled Xue Lie with a move, swiftly snatching the glue bead from him. Seeing this, Xue Lie chased after Ni Kongkong, only to be met with a strike from Yang Zhenhu. Dodging the attack with a sidestep, Xue Lie then kicked him back.
1:30:28|1:30:35|[Yang Zhenhu] was shocked by the power of Xue Lie. Although he found it hard to believe, the situation was urgent, so he had to throw himself wholeheartedly into the battle.
1:30:36|1:30:44|Xue Lie easily dodged all of Yang Zhenhu's powerful attacks and even pierced through Yang Zhenhu's shoulder armor with bone spurs.
1:30:47|1:30:51|Okka tried to escape by hanging on the rubber beads, but he couldn't outrun the flying Xue Lie.
1:30:55|1:31:11|[Ni Kongkong] caught the rubber ball and turned to run, but was soon caught up by [Xue Lie]. He tried to resist, but a single heavy punch from [Xue Lie] sent [Ni Kongkong] flying several seconds away. Gritting his teeth, he struggled to get up with all his strength, but as soon as he looked up, he saw a bone spike coming towards him.
1:31:12|1:31:23|Just as Ni Kongkong was about to be pierced by the bone spike, Okka suddenly pushed him away, but got stabbed himself. Xue Lie retracted the bone spike, and Okka fell to the ground instantly, lifeless.
1:31:30|1:31:46|Xue Lie opened the box of the Focus Bead and placed it in front of [He Ying]. After a moment, the Focus Bead was absorbed into [He Ying]. At the moment of their fusion, the Focus Bead released tremendous power. At this moment, Ni Honghong couldn't care less about the fate of the Focus Bead, she hugged Ouka and cried out.
1:32:22|1:32:39|The [Mud Kongkong] and [Sky Eye] merged briefly, and Mud Kongkong's energy was fully activated. A huge energy fluctuation gathered through the Sky Eye. The next moment, all the energy turned into beams of light shooting into the sky, as if Mud Kongkong's immense energy tore open a hole in the sky.
1:32:39|1:32:50|Throughout the scene, everyone looked up in astonishment at the sky, but only [Ni Kongkong] remained indifferent. He slowly placed the okra on the ground and finally turned all his anger into strength, rushing towards the snowy ground.
1:32:51|1:33:11|Ni Kongkong, after all, is just a physical body. Despite his anger and a shot, it all seems insignificant in the face of absolute strength. With a simple punch, Xue Lie sends Ni Kongkong flying again. At this moment, Hei Yu arrives with his guards in a hurry.
1:33:11|1:33:20|Two guards obeyed the order without any delay, reaching out to try to take down the Jiao Zhu directly. However, to their surprise, the moment the Jiao Zhu's energy sucked them in, they vanished into thin air.
1:33:30|1:33:45|Through the windows of the great hall, [Ni Kongkong] looked at the cracks in the sky with anticipation. The cracks became more dazzling, and as energy was injected, dozens of droplets flew out of the cracks and scattered to various corners of Tian Du City. These droplets were bird-like in shape, but with strange forms.
1:33:45|1:34:2|The body has three pairs of small wings on both sides, the body is semi-transparent, and the mouth on the face is very sharp. The people have never seen Ni Kongkong before and are very curious. A man stared intently at Ni Kongkong beside him, even wanting to touch it with his hand. But the next second, Ni Kongkong suddenly attacked, diving directly into the man's body.
1:34:3|1:34:21|Before the man could react, splashes burst out from his heart. Instantly, the people in the city scattered like a pot boiling over, while hundreds of splashes in the city kept chasing after them, continuously drilling into the bodies of the people. Even more terrifying, from the cracks in the sky, a dense swarm of splashes flew out.
1:34:21|1:34:26|Like a waterfall rushing towards the Heavenly Capital, the spray swiftly descended onto the streets of the city.
1:34:27|1:34:35|Its destructive power is like a locust plague, causing grass to grow in an instant. With a small and agile body, it moves at an extremely fast speed. Such formidable characteristics all come together in one, prompting the [Emperor] to issue orders upon seeing it.
1:35:4|1:35:8|The Emperor was about to give orders when he saw Hei Yu riding Fei Long into the sky.
1:35:32|1:35:45|Xue Lie said, with a fierce expression, as he drew his sword and rushed towards [Hei Yu], who drew his sword to defend. The winged [Hei Yu] and the powerful Xue Lie fought evenly for a short time, which surprised Xue Lie.
1:35:45|1:35:57|[Hei Yu] seized the surprised sword move of Xue Lie, cutting off the armor on Xue Lie's left arm with one sword strike, but was kicked away at the same time. Ignoring the pain, [Hei Yu] quickly got up from the ground and continued the battle.
1:35:57|1:36:10|Just then, as [Hei Yu] was getting the upper hand, [Ni Kongkong] slowly approached Jiao Zhu. After looking at the crack in the palm of his hand, he reached out directly to try to take the Jiao Zhu.
1:36:10|1:36:17|Ni Kongkong, who could resonate with the Focus Bead, was not engulfed by its energy, but instead moved closer and closer to the Focus Bead.
1:36:19|1:36:23|Xue Lie cut off his wings, flew to [Ni Kongkong]'s side, and stabbed towards his chest with a sword.
1:36:30|1:36:48|Ni Kongkong was kicked away by Xue Lie, and Hei Yu flew towards Xue Lie's chest to attack. At this moment, Feng Xiao suddenly appeared and sacrificed himself to shoot an arrow into Xue Lie's back. Injured, Xue Lie temporarily withdrew from the battle, and Hei Yu and Feng Xiao quickly helped Ni Kongkong up.
1:36:55|1:37:12|Impatient [Hei Yu] swung his sword again as soon as he finished speaking, aiming at Xue Lie. Meanwhile, [Ni Kongkong] knew his mission was to retrieve the gel bead. He leaped joyfully, reaching out towards the gel bead with all his might, trying to get closer to it. At this moment, the evil force also joined the battle, helping [Ni Kongkong] buy time along with [Hei Yu].
1:37:12|1:37:30|The Xue Lie sword unleashed its full power, first kicking the evil force unconscious, then forcing [Hei Yu] to retreat step by step. At the same time, the Heavenly City was riddled with holes under the piercing spray, with cracks in the sky continuously spewing out spray. Even the heavy city towers could not withstand the attack of the spray and collapsed.
1:37:30|1:37:43|In the secret room, [Hei Yu] and Ge Li, despite being repeatedly repelled by Xue Lie, did not hesitate at all to stand up time and time again in order to buy time, thwart Xue Lie's conspiracy, and protect the people of Tian Du City.
1:37:43|1:37:57|Although not a match for Xue Lie, even if they could fight for just one more second, they would rush up without hesitation. After Xue Lie repelled the two, he leaped forward and shot an arrow straight towards [Ni Kongkong], with Fei Yu and Ge Li flying over trying to stop him.
1:37:57|1:38:7|Just as the arrow mark of Xue Lie was about to hit [Ni Kongkong], he successfully took the gel bead from the Eye of the Sky. In an instant, a huge energy fluctuation sent everyone present flying.
1:38:7|1:38:24|After shattering all the flying droplets raging in the city, the cracks in the sky gradually closed without the surrendered energy, and the remaining droplets were sucked back by Jing Shu. After a night of battle, Tian Du City welcomed the first ray of morning sunlight again, but [Hei Yu] in the secret room lay motionless on the ground.
1:38:41|1:38:46|Hei Yu placed his fingers in front of Ni Kongkong's nostrils and found that Ni Kongkong had no breath.
1:39:8|1:39:12|When [Hei Yu] was crying heartbreakingly, [Ni Kongkong] suddenly spoke up.
1:39:32|1:39:48|[Hei Yu] lightly punched [Ni Kongkong] in the chest, and [Ni Kongkong] grabbed his hand in response. But this time, [Hei Yu] did not refuse, instead interlocking his index finger with [Ni Kongkong]. In that moment, [Ni Kongkong] became an indispensable person in [Hei Yu]'s heart. Several days later, inside the palace.
1:39:57|1:40:14|The Emperor picked up the crown belonging to the Crown Prince from the tray and personally placed it on He Li's head. The shining pearl, also sealed by [Yang Zhenhu], was locked in the most secure chamber of Zhenhu Court.
1:40:15|1:40:23|The city of Tiandu has regained its former prosperity. [Ni Kongkong] and the others found Lao Yuan with Ou Ka. Lao Yuan took out the life-saving medicine and said.
1:40:26|1:40:36|She has been able to survive until now because when [Xue Lie] released the Jiaozhu energy, she happened to be nearby.
1:41:26|1:41:42|Just as the few people were chatting and laughing, Okka's fingers moved lightly, and his palm glowed like [Ni Kongkong]. He finally showed signs of life, after experiencing a lot of black rain in the afternoon, sitting on the edge of the cliff, overlooking the rebuilt Tian Du City, contemplating life.
1:41:42|1:41:51|At this moment, [Ni Kongkong] walked up from behind and sat down next to [Hei Yu] gently. After exchanging a shy glance, [Ni Kongkong] took the initiative to ask.
1:42:26|1:42:41|[Ni Kongkong] hadn't finished speaking when [Hei Yu] grabbed his hand and jumped off the cliff, then spread his wings and flew, holding [Ni Kongkong] tightly in his arms. [Ni Kongkong] also held on to [Hei Yu] tightly, not daring to let go. The two of them shuttled back and forth in the valley for a while, then flew into the clouds.
1:42:44|1:42:50|[Ni Kongkong] gradually stopped being afraid, looking at [Hei Yu] tenderly and happily.
1:42:50|1:43:5|At this moment, [Hei Yu] seemed to have noticed his gaze. The two of them looked deeply into each other's eyes, and suddenly, [Hei Yu] flew vertically upwards, carrying [Ni Kongkong] through the clouds and stopping in mid-air. Finally, the two of them landed firmly together.
1:43:5|1:43:12|[Ni Kongkong] touched [Hei Yu] with her sincerity and bravery, and the two of them lived together in harmony for the rest of their lives.
1:43:13|1:43:24|With Ni Kongkong reaping the rewards of a beautiful love, the fantasy journey is also coming to an end.
