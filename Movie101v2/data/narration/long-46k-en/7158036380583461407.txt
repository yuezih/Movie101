0:2:21|0:2:40|[Du Ziteng] drove a pickup truck, listening to the radio as he passed through the streets and alleys, arriving at a bungalow. After getting out of the car with gifts in hand, he looked at himself in the rearview mirror, tidied his hair with one hand, squeezed out a smile, and cautiously opened the iron gate.
0:2:53|0:3:11|[Du Ziteng] was startled by the sudden appearance of a big dog, then got up and walked over slowly. Hearing the sound, [Du Ziteng] turned his head and waved his hand.
0:3:20|0:3:28|[Lao Song] turned around, lifted the door curtain, and walked into the room, leaving [Du Ziteng] standing in the courtyard with a gift box in hand. The first shot appeared, showing the Old Du Restaurant.
0:4:28|0:4:49|Du Ziteng, make a clumsy move, from one wall to the other, but when he turns around, he sees a gorgeously dressed woman standing by the door, her arm slowly retracting in mid-air. Lost in memories, at that time she was carrying a sack and passing by the entrance of the restaurant hall, when she heard a series of rapid breaths.
0:4:49|0:5:1|She took a few steps back, lifted the door curtain, and saw a glamorous woman being held by a man. In a moment of distraction, the balloon in [Du Ziteng]'s hand slipped and flew out, bringing her back to reality.
0:6:2|0:6:18|Fan Huahua gets into the car but can't start the engine, [Du Ziteng] mocks her.
0:6:26|0:6:35|[Du Ziteng] held a brick he had just picked up at the door, pointing forward as Fan Huahua drove away from Lao Du's restaurant in flames.
0:6:35|0:6:52|[Du Ziteng] was about to walk back, but stopped and looked towards the stage. The actor immediately started singing, and he waved the fly swatter, dancing along with the song on the stage. Seeing this, the Nanfu staff who was watching the excitement at the door returned to the shop. A large truck drove by on the street outside the restaurant.
0:6:53|0:7:6|Fan Huahua, driving and talking on the phone, didn't notice the van coming from the opposite direction. Startled, she quickly looked up, turned the steering wheel, hit the brakes, and stopped the car by the side of the road.
0:7:6|0:7:21|The scene shifts to a large courtyard in Shanxi, where a dozen men in black clothes form a square. One person is kneeling in the center, while the man sitting in a chair in front of him takes off his sunglasses, hands them to the bodyguard behind him, and picks up the teacup on the table to take a sip.
0:7:34|0:7:45|After hanging up the phone with [Fan Huahua], Du Ziteng punched the man kneeling on the ground and knocked him down, then returned to Lao Du's restaurant. Police officer Chun Ge walked into the shop and asked.
0:8:16|0:8:34|[Du Ziteng], looking towards the hall, saw [Chun Ge] turning his head. [Chun Ge] nodded back and walked towards the hall. He pushed aside the door curtain and glanced at the guests eating inside. At this moment, Qin Shousheng arrived at [Fan Huahua]'s place and got out of the car to ask.
0:8:57|0:9:13|Qin Shousheng stopped by the car and pointed to Fan Huahua's car, saying something to the bodyguard. Soon after, he drove to Du Ziteng's restaurant. Inside the restaurant, there was a suitcase full of money on the table. Qin Shousheng picked up a stack of bills, took a deep breath, and put it away.
0:10:6|0:10:21|He took out the divorce agreement. [Du Ziteng] extended his arm and gestured with his pinky finger. [Qin Shousheng] looked at [Du Ziteng] retracting his hand. [Du Ziteng] looked at him without saying a word.
0:10:33|0:10:42|[Qin Shousheng] popped a balloon provocatively. He quickly pulled up [Fan Huahua].
0:10:47|0:11:6|Du Ziteng sat alone in the shop, looking at the suitcase full of money on the table, and recalling the scene of the two being forced together. Fan Huahua quickly straightened her clothes, pushed away Yin Cha, and Yin Cha followed Fan Huahua's gaze and turned his head.
0:11:6|0:11:10|[Du Ziteng] stood still, his body trembling slightly, and blinked his eyes.
0:11:11|0:11:27|That night, he pushed open a large door, carrying a suitcase in his hand, and looked around the courtyard as he walked. Lanterns hung under the beams of the Shanxi courtyard, [Du Ziteng] walked to the middle of the courtyard, set down the suitcase, and crossed his hands behind his back.
0:12:33|0:12:51|[Du Ziteng], kicked the suitcase that had just been picked up and put down with his foot, straightened the hem of his clothes, turned around and walked out. Driving the car, [Du Ziteng] passed by a park where aunts were waving fans and dancing square dance. She slowly stopped the car, looked around, and suddenly started moving her hands.
0:13:3|0:13:28|After a silent burst of laughter, [Du Ziteng] started the car and drove past a shopping center. His phone rang, so he pulled over to answer the call. He drove back to the restaurant, and the light next to [Mu Zi] was broken, turning it into an old-fashioned restaurant.
0:13:30|0:13:53|Bare-legged in high heels and a down jacket, [Song Yujiao] got out of the car with [Du Ziteng] opening the door. [Song Yujiao] followed her, lifting the door curtain and walking in. Everyone in the shop looked around, and suddenly the lights came on. The banquet hall was surrounded by round tables with light bulbs, and there were fruits and cakes on top.
0:13:53|0:13:57|[Song Yujiao] was surprised to see her poster hanging on the wall in front of her.
0:14:1|0:14:19|Yujiao picked up a heart-shaped balloon from the ground and smiled. [Du Ziteng] then walked out from the kitchen with two wine glasses in hand, a bottle of wine tucked under his arm, and played a song on his phone. Yujiao turned around at the sound, and [Du Ziteng] leaned against the door frame.
0:14:19|0:14:24|Yujiao looked at Du Ziteng with a loving expression on her face, showing a happy smile. Du Ziteng walked to the table.
0:14:37|0:14:53|Watching [Song Yujiao] slam her hands on the table, [Du Ziteng] went to get white wine and two bowls, poured one and handed it to [Song Yujiao]. After sitting down, he was about to clink bowls with [Song Yujiao].
0:14:55|0:15:0|[Song Yujiao] smiled gently and also picked up the bowl.
0:15:10|0:15:17|[Du Ziteng] heard this and picked up the overturned red wine glass, pouring in the wine. [Song Yujiao] propped up her chin with one hand and raised the wine glass with the other.
0:16:1|0:16:12|Standing aside, [Du Ziteng] pursed his lips, then suddenly knelt down, holding a ring in his hand. [Song Yujiao] was stunned.
0:17:29|0:17:51|He took out the divorce agreement and spread it out on the table. In his excitement, the ring fell to the ground. [Du Ziteng] quickly bent down to pick it up, which made Yu Jia laugh, and [Du Ziteng] laughed along.
0:18:2|0:18:9|The two stood up and laughed, but as Song Yujiao turned around, she jumped up and hugged Du Ziteng, their eyes met, and they couldn't control their feelings.
0:18:37|0:18:56|[Du Ziteng] walked out of the inner hall, while putting on the vest that had just been half stripped by [Song Yujiao], he zipped it all the way up to his chin. He pushed aside the door curtain and walked into the hall, with [Song Yujiao] following him out of the inner hall, one hand holding onto the door frame, looking around, and then slowly walking out.
0:18:56|0:19:0|[Du Ziteng] unlocked the door, looked outside, and then walked out.
0:19:4|0:19:25|On a cold night, the wind made him shiver. Just as he was about to turn back, he noticed a large package on the ground. [Du Ziteng] walked over, bent down to take a look, glanced around to make sure no one was nearby, then immediately squatted down to unzip the package. Just as he saw it was a pottery jar, a gunshot suddenly rang out.
0:19:28|0:19:39|[Du Ziteng] was so scared that he sat down on the ground, then quickly stumbled into the house. A truck passed by on the road, and [Du Ziteng] crouched down and felt his way to the door frame.
0:19:44|0:20:0|He carefully moved to the glass window next to the signature dish, stooped down and pushed the gauze window open slightly, observing the activity outside. Behind him, [Song Yujiao] half-crouched and ran to his back. The screen quickly turned black and moved to the second chapter, knife-cut noodles.
0:20:0|0:20:8|In a noodle shop, as the perspective carrying two bowls of noodles moves, [Fan Huahua] is sitting across from [Leng Housheng], who is picking up a chopstick of noodles.
0:20:24|0:20:27|Leng Housheng takes off his sunglasses.
0:20:56|0:21:1|The scene shifts to an underground room, where nine tables are set up and people are playing mahjong at the table in the middle.
0:21:16|0:21:29|Please have [Qin Shousheng] walk up in a suit. Then, [Young Master Song] signs the IOU and asks [Qin Shousheng] to lock eyes with the short bald man behind him.
0:21:35|0:21:56|The man opposite pushed down the mahjong tiles, [Song Yujiao] casually picked one up, touched it and smiled. But the man opposite drew a nine of bamboo, beating [Song Yujiao]'s six of bamboo. The scene switched to the office, [Song Yujiao] was drinking tea, pursing her lips.
0:22:8|0:22:11|Celebrates taking the IOU from [Leng Housheng].
0:22:35|0:22:39|Leng Housheng walked over expressionlessly, lifted up Song Siyuan, and pressed him onto the table.
0:23:5|0:23:39|The two walked out, with [Leng Housheng] remembering to take the IOU. The scene shifted to the [Song family]. [Lao Song] leaned on his cane, silent. Hearing the sound of a beast, he received a glance from [Song Siyuan], turned his head, and let [Leng Housheng] open the folder and step forward. The two exchanged a glance, and [Qin Shousheng] put on his sunglasses.
0:24:6|0:24:9|[Qin Shousheng] stood up, opened his mouth stiffly, and then sat back down.
0:24:28|0:24:34|In the house, [Fan Huahua] who is playing on her phone steps out to help her father, [Qin Shousheng], who stops her and turns back.
0:24:45|0:24:54|[Qin Shousheng] walked out while giving [Leng Housheng] a kick, and [Fan Huahua] spoke up. [Song Siyuan] stepped forward, pointing with his index finger.
0:25:18|0:25:43|[Fan Huahua] pushed [Lao Song] to the ground again. [Lao Song] picked up the teacup on the table and threw it to the ground, then spoke while leaning on his cane. [Song Siyuan] turned and left, heading to a restaurant where two beautiful women were sitting beside him.
0:25:58|0:26:5|[Qin Shousheng] across the way raised his hand and gave [Leng Housheng] a hit on the head.
0:26:14|0:26:18|[Leng Housheng] holds down both sides of [Leng Housheng] and Yin Cha.
0:27:10|0:27:22|The scene shifts to a dilapidated courtyard with a group of men forming a circle. In the center, three workers have already dug a deep pit and are continuing to dig with shovels.
0:27:22|0:27:39|Two workers with hoes stood at the edge of the pit, while [Song Siyuan], leaning forward, looked into the pit with his hands in his pockets, rolling a clod of soil under his feet. He glanced at the people on both sides, took a few steps, then turned back and spoke.
0:28:39|0:28:46|Soon, Du Ziteng looked at the jar. Du Ziteng put down the jar and said.
0:29:41|0:29:45|The expert turned around, and [Qin Shousheng] handed over the file bag.
0:30:10|0:30:20|[Qin Shousheng] quickly grabbed a cloth to wrap up the jar that had just almost fallen. Leng Housheng pointed blankly towards the door.
0:30:25|0:30:29|The two of them changed a cloth bag, and [Qin Shousheng] stuffed the jar into the cabinet.
0:31:20|0:31:23|[Yellow Hair], a famous killer from Hong Kong.
0:31:36|0:31:57|The scene shifts to a sharp and decisive action of a killer, with the sound of a beast. On a street, after a pair of feet appear and stand firm, a motorcycle approaches in the facing direction. [Yellow Hair], carrying a backpack and wearing a jacket, extends his arm towards the motorcycle.
0:31:57|0:32:14|The motorcycle slowed down and stopped, his eyes squinted slightly behind the sunglasses as they locked eyes. He walked towards the motorcycle owner. On the other side, a police car was parked on a stone bridge, and a police officer walked to the edge of the bridge, raising a camera to take a photo.
0:32:14|0:32:27|Under the grass by the bridge, several policemen were busy. One of them, a policeman taking photos for evidence, picked up a pair of glasses, put them in a bag, and handed them to the captain. The captain took a look and passed them to the person next to him.
0:32:29|0:32:47|At this moment, two masked men tiptoed into Qin Shousheng's room, one of them holding a large bag and looking towards the door. They squatted down, opened the cabinet where jars were stored, and took out jars to fill the bag. The screen went black, and a short-haired woman was seen looking into a mirror.
0:33:51|0:33:55|The scene cuts back to the courtyard of [Song Yujiao]'s house, where [Fan Huahua] is on the phone.
0:34:42|0:34:54|This is [Qin Shousheng] putting 500,000 in cash into the briefcase for old [Du Ziteng]. It's 10 o'clock at night, the door next to the window is opened, and the long-haired woman in front is pushed against the wall by the man in fur coat behind her.
0:35:9|0:35:31|The indoor lights suddenly turned on, and the man in fur coat complained. [Qin Shousheng] and a few henchmen were sitting on the kang. The man in fur coat wanted to run, but was blocked and [Qin Shousheng] stood up.
0:35:39|0:35:59|Qin Shousheng knocked down the fur-coated man with a punch and walked up to the long-haired woman. Leng Housheng immediately stepped forward, holding a knife close to the woman's neck, and the woman spoke.
0:36:0|0:36:21|The woman with long hair took out her phone, dared not lower her head, and could only dial the number with her eyes downcast. The gloomy voice came through. [Qin Shousheng] thought for a moment, then kicked the fur-clad man on the ground.
0:36:32|0:36:45|He turned back and squatted in front of Yellow Hair. He took out Yellow Hair's wallet and lifted up his fur coat.
0:37:4|0:37:27|At the intersection near the old bean restaurant, Leng Housheng said, "Speak up." The van carrying several people slowly stopped, with its front facing a pile of dirt on the side of the road. Yin Cha got off the car, approached the passenger seat, and tapped the head of the person sitting there. Leng Housheng asked, "Who's in the passenger seat?"
0:37:27|0:37:30|[Qin Shousheng] reached out two fingers to feel his breath.
0:37:46|0:37:48|[Qin Shousheng] instructs the henchmen in the van.
0:38:0|0:38:19|Just like that, [Qin Shousheng] followed by [Leng Housheng], with six henchmen behind them, arrived menacingly at the entrance of Old Du's restaurant. [Qin Shousheng] suddenly stopped and looked back, the people behind him quickly stopped and looked back as well. Suddenly, [Qin Shousheng] turned around and ran back, with the people behind him quickly following.
0:38:19|0:38:45|The screen fades to black, transitioning to the third chapter. By a twist of fate, the monks in Yuanzhao Temple are ringing the bell. Looking down from above, next door is the courtyard where [Yin Cha] is digging a pit, with only a wall separating the two. A man and a woman enter the temple, with the girl kneeling in front of the Buddha statue.
0:38:45|0:38:54|In the courtyard, the man wearing a duckbill cap looked at the girl kneeling in front of him with a smile, clasped his hands together, and pursed his lips. At this moment, voices could be heard coming from the neighboring courtyard.
0:39:7|0:39:22|Originally, [Du Ziteng] had been keeping an eye on the jar all along. Even when [Qin Shousheng] placed the jar, he was observing from outside the window. The scene shifts to the street, where a man wearing a duckbill cap walks into a black sister's jelly noodle shop.
0:39:25|0:39:31|The owner of the cold noodle shop is the girl who was kneeling and praying in the temple. She brings over the cold noodles.
0:40:3|0:40:15|The girl returned to the front desk, locked eyes with the man in the baseball cap, then turned to look at the jade necklace advertisement on the TV. The man spoke.
0:40:17|0:40:39|The man in the duckbill cap takes a quick drag, then continues to snort powder with his head down. After finishing, he goes out onto the street and starts stuffing flyers into car door handles. Outside a teahouse's glass window, he seems to notice something, suddenly turns his head, and looks at a man and a woman inside the shop, with [Du Ziteng]'s girlfriend pulling her hand away. The man in the duckbill cap quickly answers the phone.
0:40:55|0:41:4|The scene shifts to the two masked men stealing jars in front. As they get the jars, they immediately drive away. Taking off their masks, they are [Yin Cha] and [Yang Cu].
0:41:14|0:41:39|Leaving the restaurant, [Fan Huahua] ran into [Yang Cuo], causing him to jerk the steering wheel in fright. The two of them walked into the restaurant.
0:41:47|0:41:50|The two walked into the restaurant of [Lao Song], where [Du Ziteng] greeted them.
0:41:55|0:42:7|The two men scanned the room, only to see [Yellow Hair] eating in the hall. Then they lifted the door curtain and entered the hall.
0:42:24|0:42:39|[Chun Ge] turned his head and asked in confusion. [Yin Cha] twitched his mouth to signal, and [Yang Cuo] looked at him and closed his mouth. Just as before, [Chun Ge] cautiously walked into the hall.
0:42:39|0:42:53|His gaze fell on the table where [Yin Cha] dropped the glass, [Yang Cuo] who had his back turned was already sweating, discreetly keeping an eye on it, then pushing his luggage bag under the table. Neither of them dared to look up.
0:43:4|0:43:21|[Yin Cha] quickly got up. The two of them left in a hurry and got into the car. Just as [Yang Cuo] took a sip of mineral water, it was snatched away by [Yin Cha]. [Yang Cuo], who was about to start the car, was stunned.
0:43:45|0:43:58|[Yin Cha] slapped [Yang Cuo] and grabbed his collar, threatening him. At that moment, [Chun Ge] drove a police car over, and the two dodged backwards together. After the police car drove away, they both stood up straight again.
0:44:0|0:44:6|Unexpectedly, the beastly singing car that came to pick up [Fan Huahua] drove by again, scaring [Yin Cha] to collapse.
0:44:22|0:44:26|The scene shifts to the counter of the Jade Palace, where [Yang Cuo] is leaning on the glass counter and looking around.
0:44:30|0:44:43|He took out his phone to check the balance, 31210. The scene shifts to Heimei's Cold Noodle Shop, where the girl is wiping the table. [Yang Cuo] arrives at the door, and the girl greets him to come in. After he walks in, he hands the paper bag to the girl.
0:44:50|0:44:54|After saying that, he left. In the evening, he started to act with Sakura Tea.
0:46:19|0:46:29|Originally, the van stopped in front of the dirt pile, and two people collided during the scuffle. [Yang Cuo] pushed Yin Cha, only to see him fall on the dashboard, unresponsive.
0:46:34|0:46:52|Yang Cuo reached out to touch his nose and took a deep breath. He pulled Yin Cha up and shook it, as if suddenly remembering something, he hesitated for a moment, then took out his wallet from the pocket of Yin Cha, put it in his pocket, and then put Yin Cha back down.
0:47:0|0:47:15|Then he put on his hat and got off the car by himself, walked around the pile of soil, looked at the nearby Old Du Restaurant, and saw the lights still on inside. He quietly approached the window and saw [Du Ziteng] proposing to [Song Yujiao], with [Du Ziteng] on one knee.
0:47:26|0:47:49|He peeked in and saw the luggage still under the table, so he crept along the wall to the backyard. Arriving at the back door, he picked up the lock, tilted his head and poked it twice, and the lock opened. He slowly walked into the shop, gently lifting the curtain as he passed through the rolling door, keeping an eye on the two people. At this moment, the two were embracing against the wall.
0:47:49|0:47:54|[Yang Cuo] smoothly arrived at the table, picked up the luggage bag, but bumped into the chair.
0:47:59|0:48:18|After speaking, [Du Ziteng] kissed again, [Yang Cuo] hugged the luggage and stood still. After finding no danger, he was ready to leave. He opened the main door, placed the luggage first, and just reached out to pick it up when a shot flew in, scaring him away. The scene shifts to Chapter Four, the master.
0:48:21|0:48:40|A motorcycle rode over a puddle, splashing mud everywhere. The person on the bike was [Yellow Hair], wearing a knitted hat and large-framed glasses. He rode the motorcycle onto the mountain road. Suddenly, he sensed something was wrong, his expression changed, and after the motorcycle wobbled a few times, it toppled over.
0:48:41|0:49:2|[Yellow Hair] also fell to the ground. After getting up, he walked around to the motorcycle and saw scattered nails on the ground. Breathing heavily, he looked around and could only push the motorcycle to start walking. Every few steps, he noticed a repair shop. He struggled to push the bike to the roadside and walked up to it.
0:49:15|0:49:26|The man on Tang Yi's side wore sunglasses, and the four brothers pulled out their pistols. The man gestured towards Tang Yi's direction. Wu came over and patted him on the back.
0:49:40|0:49:58|[Yellow Hair] put away his smile and looked at [Uncle Wu] who took off his sunglasses. He clasped his hands together, nodded, and then turned to leave the auto repair shop. Every two steps he took, his phone rang, and he answered the call with a wolf-like voice on the other end.
0:50:6|0:50:23|After hanging up the phone, he pursed his lips and ran on the street. After a while, a car pulled up behind him and slowly stopped. The person driving the car was [Fur Coat Man].
0:50:38|0:50:44|[Yellow Hair] drove down a small road to a desolate area and then hit the brakes.
0:51:5|0:51:20|[Yellow Hair] got out of the car and ran towards the low mud wall in front of him. After climbing over the dilapidated wall, he disappeared. [Yellow Hair] looked out the window, waited left and right but didn't see him coming back, couldn't help but open the car door.
0:51:26|0:51:50|He walked towards the direction where the man in fur coat ran, climbed up the earthen wall, looked down but didn't see anyone. At this moment, the sound of a car starting came from below, and [Yellow Hair] hurriedly ran down. He could only watch as the man in fur coat drove away, walking desolately on the road.
0:52:2|0:52:16|He looked at his phone. Glancing around, he put the phone in his pocket. Not far away was the Langdu Hotel. Just around the corner of the dirt pile, [Fan Huahua] drove over.
0:52:24|0:52:41|[Yellow Hair] sat by the roadside. He struggled to stand up, looked at his palm, and didn't forget to give a middle finger in the direction where [Fan Huahua] left. Turning around and clapping his hands, he noticed the old Du restaurant across the street and walked in.
0:53:11|0:53:35|[Du Ziteng], blowing up a balloon, gestured to the male waiter to give it to [Yellow Hair]. Just as it was charged, the female waiter brought the dishes. The female waiter said to him. Looking at the unfamiliar food in front of him, [Yellow Hair] touched his mouth, then blinked, picked up the rice cake first, shook it, and then put it into his mouth.
0:53:35|0:53:37|At this moment, [Chun Ge] walked over.
0:54:9|0:54:32|[Yellow Hair] put down the money he took out from his woolen hat and got up to leave. [Du Ziteng] caught up with him. [Du Ziteng] turned around, glanced at the tables in the shop, then turned back to look at the departing [Yellow Hair]. By the roadside, [Yellow Hair] got off the truck driver's vehicle.
0:54:36|0:55:1|Walking and looking at her fully charged phone, she noticed something and quickly rushed to [Lao Gen] who was selling meatballs and steaks by the road.
0:55:11|0:55:26|[Yellow Hair] looked helplessly at [Lao Gen] and Auntie, ready to grab the bag and leave. Unexpectedly, [Lao Gen] grabbed his woolen hat, causing the bag to fall to the ground. Raising the stick in his hand, [Lao Gen] started hitting [Yellow Hair]'s arms and then struck at his body.
0:55:26|0:55:49|[Yellow Hair] kept backing away, the scene shifted to [Fan Huahua], who was tearing off a face mask in front of the mirror. After taking off the mask, she seemed to hear something, looked outside, then unfolded the mask and continued applying it in front of the mirror. Another sound, she turned her head, patted the mask, got up and walked towards the door.
0:55:52|0:56:14|In the corridor, a kitten is by the window. As it turns around, it is covered by [Yellow Hair]. At this moment, [Du Ziteng] arrives in the courtyard carrying a suitcase.
0:56:48|0:57:14|Watching [Du Ziteng] leave, [Yellow Hair] said. [Yellow Hair] knocked out [Fan Huahua] with a punch, then walked into the courtyard, picked up the briefcase left by [Du Ziteng] containing five hundred thousand, tapped it, reached out to wipe off the dust inside the house, then raised the corners of his mouth, walked towards the door, sidestepped out from the door crack, and closed the door.
0:57:22|0:57:39|It turns out to be [Uncle Wu], with [Yellow Hair] lying on the ground. The screen goes black and transitions to the fifth chapter. [Uncle Wu] is walking out of the detention center. With his hands in his pockets, he walks forward, while the four brothers over there are waiting for him by the car.
0:57:40|0:57:56|Watching [Uncle Wu] with his splayed feet, no one said a word. It wasn't until [Uncle Wu] approached that the bald brother extended his arm to invite him into the car, followed by the other four. In the blink of an eye, the five of them drove to a bathhouse to take a bath.
0:57:56|0:58:2|The four brothers sat together, with an ashtray on the table with salt on it, and [Uncle Wu] emerged from the water tank.
0:58:3|0:58:20|With his arm stretched out, he then took a towel and covered his head with it, turned his head, picked up a cigarette next to the ashtray, and lit it with a lighter. Turning back, his body slowly slid down, took a deep drag of the cigarette, and as he exhaled the smoke, he fell into a reverie.
0:58:29|0:58:42|[Uncle Wu] stood in the middle of the casino, reached out his hand, and then turned to look at the small window behind him. He recalled the words of [Qin Shousheng] in the detention center.
0:58:54|0:59:10|Saying that, he reached out his hand towards [Uncle Wu], then bent his fingers to signal goodbye. As the memory ended, with a cigarette hanging from his mouth, [Uncle Wu] tilted his head back, and the bald brother leaned towards him, giving him a back massage.
0:59:34|0:59:46|[Uncle Wu] threw the cigarette, bald brother. The big brother across the way picked up the cigarette butt and threw it outside the pool. [Uncle Wu] reached out his arm and stopped the bald brother.
0:59:52|0:59:57|The scene shifts, and five people arrive at a dimly lit massage parlor, with the masseur stepping forward.
1:0:29|1:0:44|[Uncle Wu] sat up and crawled to the front of the priest. The technician turned out to be Yin Cha's girlfriend, [Yi Meng]. [Uncle Wu] watched him leave, then slowly turned back and spoke.
1:0:46|1:0:50|And at this moment, [Qin Shousheng] is at the scene digging a pit.
1:0:54|1:1:4|Uncle Wu moved forward, squinting his eyes. After the massage, he led his four brothers to the "Rabbit Head Restaurant" and stopped at the entrance to speak.
1:1:6|1:1:18|This time, his call was answered. [Uncle Wu] leaned in to listen on the phone. It was the moment when the beasts hid their voices and the jars.
1:1:21|1:1:27|Several people walked into the Rabbit Head Restaurant. On a kang, they were eating rabbit heads. Uncle Wu was holding a rabbit head.
1:1:33|1:1:48|Uncle Wu was about to eat the rabbit head in his hand, but stopped. At this moment, it was Qin Shousheng who answered the phone at Old Du's restaurant. Du Ziteng and Fan Huahua were sitting, and he turned his back to answer.
1:1:59|1:2:6|[Qin Shousheng] hung up the phone, and the bald brother looked at his phone. The big brother sitting across from him spoke up.
1:2:10|1:2:20|[Uncle Wu] pinched the rabbit's head, his eyes downcast as he tugged at the corner of his mouth, lost in memories. When he was arrested, he looked towards the small window, negotiating with [Qin Shousheng].
1:2:50|1:3:0|Later, several people arrived at Heimei's Cold Noodle Shop. After finishing a bowl of cold noodles, [Uncle Wu] took out two pieces of paper to wipe his mouth, then threw them on the table and looked towards the door.
1:3:4|1:3:12|[Uncle Wu] rolled his tongue in his mouth, then took out his phone, unlocked it, opened the album, clicked on the photo of Yellow Hair, and turned to ask the landlady.
1:3:17|1:3:21|The landlady [Soft Girl] glanced forward and shook her head.
1:3:51|1:4:10|At this moment, [Yellow Hair] was still riding a motorcycle, when a young man suddenly emerged from the roadside weeds and picked up a walkie-talkie.
1:4:15|1:4:35|The bald brother also emerged, took out nails from his waist bag, and scattered them on the road. Just like before, [Yellow Hair] fell down, and the bald brother spoke. As before, [Uncle Wu] watched [Yellow Hair] approaching. The bald brother grabbed [Yellow Hair]'s bag.
1:4:49|1:5:2|[Yellow Hair] turned around, clasping his hands in a fist, showing respect for [Uncle Wu]'s righteousness. Watching him leave, [Uncle Wu] took out a cigarette and put it in his mouth. The four brothers picked up their pistols, pulled the trigger, only to reveal that they were all lighters.
1:5:26|1:5:42|At night, [Uncle Wu] went to [Qin Shousheng]'s house and met [Yellow Hair] who had just come out at the door. With a swing of the iron rod, [Yellow Hair] fell to the ground. He squatted down, opened the dropped briefcase, saw that it was full of money, and then looked back at [Yellow Hair].
1:5:55|1:6:0|After entering the door, he walked into the courtyard carrying a suitcase, and then stood still and shouted into the house.
1:6:5|1:6:9|Hearing the sound of water splashing in the room, he smiled.
1:6:39|1:6:55|[Fan Huahua], tied to a chair with her mouth gagged by [Yellow Hair], was struggling. After [Uncle Wu] walked out and squatted down, he spoke to the fallen [Yellow Hair] before standing up, looking around, and then leaving.
1:7:2|1:7:15|His index finger and thumb pinched the cigarette butt, flicked it and threw it on the ground, then he strode into the square dance group. He held the suitcase in his hands, spinning in the crowd, and then joined the aunties waving fans.
1:7:15|1:7:35|With a big smile on his face, he walked to the side of the road. Just as he stepped onto the road, his feet were still stepping on scraps of cloth when the car lights shone on his face. He turned his head and saw a car coming towards him. [Uncle Wu] widened his eyes and mouth, then he was knocked down by the car, money scattered around. The screen went black, and we arrived at Chapter Six, "A Dream of Red Mansions".
1:8:31|1:8:38|[Yin Cha] pursed his lips, while on the other side, the leather-jacketed man behind the dirt pile was squatting and tying his shoelaces.
1:8:49|1:9:9|He climbed up the dirt pile and saw [Uncle Wu], [Yellow Hair], and others. He turned and ran to the car, put on sunglasses, and raised the sign of the empty car. Sure enough, not long after driving, he caught up with [Yellow Hair] who was running. He slowly stopped the car, lowered his sunglasses, and leaned over to ask.
1:9:9|1:9:34|He had been hiding and observing on the side under the pretext of going to the bathroom. When [Yellow Hair] got off the car, he immediately rushed back. Through the rearview mirror, he confirmed that he had shaken off [Yellow Hair]. He drove to the main road and stopped next to a building. Unbuckling the seat belt, he took [Yellow Hair]'s bag from the back seat.
1:9:34|1:9:42|He found a wallet inside, indeed with a stack of money. He continued to search happily, but his expression changed when he took out a gun.
1:9:46|1:10:10|Startled, he took a look and saw [Lao Gen], so he rolled down the window. The man in the leather jacket suddenly remembered something and reached into his inner pocket. Then, another thought crossed his mind.
1:10:12|1:10:24|[Lao Gen] turned around, the man in the leather jacket walked down with [Yellow Hair]'s bag. After a while, in the massage parlor, [Yi Meng]'s phone showed a call from [Huang Liang]. After speaking, [Yi Meng] walked into the corridor and went downstairs.
1:10:40|1:10:49|After looking at the phone, he wanted to run to the corner of the wall, still checking if anyone was coming over, then smiled and dialed the phone.
1:10:59|1:11:5|After hanging up the phone, [Huang Liang] rested one arm on the car and dialed another number.
1:11:8|1:11:23|The scene shifts to inside a teahouse, where [Huang Liang] is sitting by the window, wearing fur and holding a rose. Sitting across from him is [Yi Meng], with her rented car outside. She smells the rose and hands it over to [Yi Meng].
1:11:54|1:12:3|[Huang Liang] held [Yi Meng]'s finger and pulled down the sunglasses. Then, he was about to move closer to [Yi Meng]'s hand.
1:12:9|1:12:30|This scene was just seen by Yang Zuo, who had just received a phone call and left quickly. In the evening, [Yi Meng] brought [Huang Liang] home, but as soon as they entered, [Huang Liang] pulled [Yi Meng] back. [Yi Meng] continued to pull him inside, holding a doll, and [Leng Housheng] was stunned when he saw the two entering the house.
1:13:0|1:13:5|After Mr. Qin Shousheng left, Miss Yin Meng closed the door and leaned against the wall, asking Yellow Hair who was lying on the ground.
1:13:38|1:13:56|[Yi Meng] squats in front of [Yellow Bird], the two locking eyes. The screen goes black, leading to the final scene, the secret formula. Outside the Old Du Restaurant, [Yang Cuo] is startled by a gunshot, hiding behind the performance truck. Across the street, [Yin Cha] and others peek out again.
1:13:56|1:14:4|Du Ziteng emerged, and as he approached the luggage bag, Yin Cha had already raised his gun.
1:14:4|1:14:30|Seeing [Du Ziteng] return to the hall, [Yin Cha] commanded! Several people ran across the street to the outside of the store, where [Yang Cuo] was startled by a sudden group of people and began to observe. Inside the store, [Du Ziteng] was crawling on the ground towards the window. Just then, [Qin Shousheng] raised his gun, [Leng Housheng] bent down to pick up a luggage bag, and [Yang Cuo] stood aside, panting and gritting his teeth.
1:14:38|1:14:52|Unexpectedly, [Yang Cuo] lunged forward. The sound of a beastly roar, a gunshot, but no bullets. Before the others could react, [Song Yujiao] only saw [Du Ziteng] turning around.
1:15:16|1:15:23|[Song Yujiao] with tears in her eyes, [Du Ziteng] ran out of the door, secretly forgetting, picking up a brick from the ground.
1:15:31|1:15:34|The scene shifts to the street, with [Yi Meng] asking Huang Liang.
1:16:0|1:16:5|Silenced [Huang Liang] quietly dropped his head again, as [Yi Meng] continued to question him.
1:16:43|1:16:51|At this moment, [Song Siyuan] regains consciousness after the car accident. [Yi Meng] answers the phone call and turns on the speakerphone.
1:17:17|1:17:34|In the car, the two locked eyes. Just as [Uncle Wu] stepped onto the road, he was hit and sent flying, with hundred yuan bills fluttering to the ground. [Uncle Wu] rolled on the ground for several rounds, leaving a pool of blood on the ground.
1:17:37|1:17:53|[Huang Liang] and [Yi Meng] were both startled by the sudden scene, took a deep breath, and it was [Huang Liang] who got off the car first. The first thing that caught their eyes was the floor covered with banknotes, followed by [Song Siyuan] lying on the ground and a suitcase in the distance.
1:17:53|1:18:1|At this moment, [Yi Meng] also got out of the car, looking at the scene in front of them. The two slowly turned to look at each other, and [Huang Liang] thought for a moment before saying.
1:18:28|1:18:43|[Yi Meng] hung up the phone on Yin Cha and looked at [Huang Liang]. Soon, the two of them drove away, leaving only Uncle Wu lying on the ground with a hundred yuan bill under his face, watching the departing car.
1:18:43|1:18:57|At the same time, [Yellow Hair], who was knocked down by [Uncle Wu], regained consciousness. He quickly sat up, adjusted his glasses, looked around, and propped up one leg while catching his breath.
1:19:6|1:19:16|With a headache, she held her head and walked slowly to the entrance of Heimei's Cold Noodle Shop, looked up, and walked in.
1:19:31|1:19:48|[Yellow Hair] sat down at the table next to him, while [Soft Girl] walked to the kitchen. Before long, [Yellow Hair] was taking off his gloves, and [Soft Girl] walked over with a bowl of cold noodles. [Yellow Hair] picked up the bowl, took a sniff, and started eating with chopsticks. [Soft Girl] glanced at him and then returned to the front desk.
1:19:48|1:19:55|Thinking of the appointment during the day, he took out the jewelry box from the bag and opened it, revealing a jade necklace inside, shining like the TV.
1:19:56|1:20:3|He took out the necklace with surprise, and [Yellow Hair] turned his head and noticed the necklace.
1:20:10|1:20:17|He was about to step back and leave, but he was hit with a stick.
1:20:27|1:20:55|He put the necklace back on the table. Just like that, [Yellow Hair] was beaten out by [Lao Gen] and fled in panic. At this moment, the driver of the van that crashed suddenly woke up. He suddenly noticed the van next to him, looked around, and opened the door. The driver of the van also noticed the noise and opened the door.
1:20:56|1:21:14|After getting off the car, closing the door gently, and preparing to walk around to check the situation from the back of the car. Unexpectedly, [Yin Cha] came around from the front and raised his hand with a knife. [Yin Cha] helped the faint driver up, opened the door of the van, and put him in. At this moment, they heard someone running over.
1:21:15|1:21:31|[Yin Cha] hid beside the car, while [Yang Cuo] who ran over was peering into the car, he was knocked down by [Yin Cha] with one hand knife and then placed him in the car. At this moment, [Qin Shousheng] and others caught up.
1:21:34|1:21:39|[Qin Shousheng] and others immediately caught up, then [Du Ziteng] also caught up.
1:21:49|1:22:6|[Du Ziteng] had already run ahead, while [Qin Shousheng] was just left lying on the ground. At this moment, on the brightly lit street, [Yellow Hair] was slowly pedaling his bicycle. Suddenly, the police car lights ahead turned on, and [Chun Ge] with a team of police officers stopped on the main road.
1:22:6|1:22:10|Yellow Hair stopped the car and walked up, Chun Ge inquired.
1:22:42|1:23:10|Just as [Yellow Hair] turned around, he realized something was wrong. [Chun Ge] said to his subordinates behind him. Two police officers handcuffed [Yellow Hair] and took him away, as the sky transitioned from dark to light. The sunlight shone through the woods in the countryside, with [Yin Cha] running ahead carrying a bag.
1:23:10|1:23:30|[Lao Song] led his men in the back, with [Du Ziteng] still chasing after them. [Yin Cha] stopped to catch his breath, and [Lao Song] also slowed down. The sunlight was glaring at this moment, with [Leng Housheng] and another henchman supporting each other to move forward.
1:23:30|1:23:39|[Du Ziteng] stopped waving his arms and looked at the sun, the mist he exhaled was very obvious in the early morning. They ran through the woods and arrived at the reed field.
1:23:42|1:24:10|Running. His men couldn't hold on and fell in the reeds, [Du Ziteng] caught up and surpassed them. They ran through the reeds and onto the yellow earth.
1:24:12|1:24:37|Under the sunlight, the dust and flying hair were illuminated. They ran across the yellow earth and arrived at a grassland. Finally, crossing the grassland, [Yin Cha] stopped in front of a small mound of soil, tears pooling on the ground. [Qin Shousheng] knelt down, holding a gun pointed at him.
1:26:9|1:26:21|[Du Ziteng] was startled, [Qin Shousheng] raised his gun and swung it towards [Yin Cha]'s head. [Yin Cha] fell to the ground, and he picked up the luggage bag, waving the gun and said.
1:26:21|1:26:39|He was about to leave with his luggage, [Du Ziteng] looked at him. He reached out his hand weakly, watching [Qin Shousheng] run away. Then he turned around, struggled to stand up, and staggered over. After looking at the person lying on the ground, he was ready to leave.
1:26:41|1:27:5|And at this moment, in the reed field, [Leng Housheng] is searching. On the other side, [Yi Meng] is happily looking at the suitcase, then turns around.
1:27:24|1:27:30|[Yin Cha] ran with a luggage bag clamped under one arm and a gun in the other hand. Suddenly, he stopped and unzipped the bag.
1:27:40|1:28:0|He tucked the luggage bag back between his arms, but slipped down after taking two steps forward. Unable to stop his steps due to inertia, [Yin Cha] collided with the car driven by Yellow Hair, and the luggage bag flew out.
1:28:43|1:29:1|[Qin Shousheng] crawled towards the luggage bag, while [Yi Meng] and Huang Liang looked out from the car. [Qin Shousheng] grabbed the luggage bag, and the two people in the car got out, he quickly pulled out a gun. At this moment, [Qin Shousheng] still had no idea.
1:29:9|1:29:16|He unzipped the bag, and the jar inside had already shattered into pieces.
1:29:35|1:30:0|He took out a piece of debris, looked at it, threw it on the ground, then took out a large piece of debris, tilted his head back, opened his mouth wide, and closed his eyes. He unfolded a piece of paper.
1:30:18|1:30:24|[Lao Song] even drew a smiley face at the end, and [Qin Shousheng] finally realized he had been played.
1:30:31|1:31:0|The screen gradually darkens and then brightens, with [Lao Song] and [Du Ziteng] sitting face to face inside the Lao Du restaurant. [Lao Song] speaks first. [Du Ziteng] takes out the divorce agreement and pushes it in front of [Lao Song]. Suddenly, [Lao Song] stands up, grabs him and pushes him against the menu on the wall.
1:31:9|1:31:17|[Du Ziteng] frowned and handed the wrench to [Lao Song] against the wall.
1:31:31|1:31:37|[Song Yujiao] walked out with two bowls. The two let go of each other's hands and looked at the menu.
1:31:44|1:32:0|[Song Yujiao] looked at the two people and walked towards the table to put down the bowl. [Du Ziteng] and [Lao Song] also walked back and sat down. [Du Ziteng] looked at the noodles in the bowl, sniffed it, picked up the chopsticks and tapped the table twice. [Song Yujiao] saw the divorce agreement on the table and picked it up.
1:32:0|1:32:2|[Lao Song] looked up and watched as [Du Ziteng] slurped his noodles.
1:32:11|1:32:23|After finishing eating, [Lao Song] drew two pieces of paper, casting a sidelong glance at [Song Yujiao], while [Du Ziteng], feeling hot, took off his coat.
1:32:23|1:32:35|Just realized, [Du Ziteng] looked at [Song Yujiao], who smiled and sat up straight. [Du Ziteng] turned to look at [Lao Song], who smiled and turned his head. [Du Ziteng] glanced at both of them at the same time.
1:32:43|1:33:2|[Lao Song] smiled and nodded, but with his hand he touched his forehead. [Song Yujiao] smiled, her eyes becoming moist. [Du Ziteng] nodded with a smile, realizing that the secret formula of [Lao Song] was his daughter, [Song Yujiao]. The film ends here, thank you for listening.
1:33:3|1:33:8|At the end of the film, we will bring you a movie Easter egg. Now let's talk about the Easter egg part.
1:33:26|1:33:31|[Leng Housheng] walked out and saw two police officers. The scene then shifted to the police station.
1:33:53|1:34:1|[Qin Shousheng] also entered a room and unexpectedly encountered his enemy. The enemy stood up.
1:34:11|1:34:28|At Qin Shousheng's home, the police were recording fake antiques and questioning Fan Huahua. Fan Huahua lowered her head, and the scene shifted to the sickbed.
1:34:39|1:34:57|[Uncle Wu] pursed his lips, the four brothers outside looked at him like this, then turned to ask the doctor. The doctor closed the pathology clip and left, the scene then shifted to the kitchen, where [Song Siyuan] was learning how to stir noodles.
1:35:8|1:35:17|[Song Siyuan] watched his master's techniques while learning, not only learning how to knead the dough, but also how to mix it. He was so focused that he seemed like a completely different person from before.
