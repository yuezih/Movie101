0:1:58|0:2:11|On the way home, [Liang Xia] was confessed by [Mao Liang], who had secretly admired her for a long time. Amidst the cheers of the crowd, [Liang Xia] finally agreed to be his girlfriend, and the two entered into a passionate relationship, inseparable every day.
0:2:12|0:2:23|[Liang Xia] changed her usual style to make sure [Mao Liang]'s love for her doesn't expire. She dressed up exquisitely and avoided her favorite snacks, locking them all in a safe.
0:2:23|0:2:38|As time went by, [Mao Liang]'s career soared, and the busyness and pressure suddenly came without warning. The smooth and relaxed pace was abruptly cut off, and the obstacles of work came one after another. He was immersed in work every day, with no time to take care of [Liang Xia].
0:2:39|0:2:48|And at this moment, [Liang Xia] has already been consumed by emotions, sharpened by life, worn down by time to the point of giving up, and lost her ideals in the current situation.
0:2:48|0:2:59|She overly relies on [Mao Liang], losing herself and her original way of life, filled with fantasies of a happy life with [Mao Liang], eagerly anticipating walking hand in hand with him into the realm of marriage.
0:2:59|0:3:7|At this moment, a figure in a white dress catches the eye, with a slender waist, tall stature, and two long and fair arms exposed, pulling up the zipper behind.
0:3:8|0:3:23|After he finished adjusting his outfit, Liang Xia casually picked up the lipstick on the table and applied it to his sexy lips. Then, he opened the perfume next to him, sprayed it on his wrist, lifted his wrist to his nose, closed his eyes, and savored this unique charm.
0:3:23|0:3:30|He looked at the satisfactory numbers on the electronic scale, walked towards the mirror with light steps, and enjoyed it alone.
0:3:39|0:3:51|At that moment, a hand reached for the alarm clock and turned off the noisy sound, while [Liang Xia] stood by the pool, carefully rubbing the orange in her hand, and then cut the orange into several small pieces.
0:3:51|0:4:6|[Mao Liang] immediately got up, walked out of the bedroom, and looked at the tablet in his hand while walking. The tablet was playing the latest news of the day. In the kitchen on the other side, [Liang Xia] was busy alone, preparing breakfast for them. The eggs were spread out in heart-shaped molds, sizzling constantly.
0:4:12|0:4:25|After taking a shower, [Mao Liang] stretched lazily on the balcony. Then he walked into the closet, carefully selecting his clothes. The simple black shirt accentuated his slender figure, as he glanced at the prepared breakfast on the table.
0:4:33|0:4:47|[Liang Xia] shyly lowered her head and turned to put the breakfast on the table. Suddenly, [Mao Liang] was attracted by the sound from the tablet, turned around and walked towards the table. The two sat facing each other, with [Liang Xia] propping her chin with one hand, gazing affectionately at [Mao Liang].
0:4:51|0:5:14|[Mao Liang] looked at [Liang Xia] with a puzzled expression, then continued eating breakfast. But [Liang Xia] couldn't contain her curiosity, immediately stood up, took out a box containing a diamond from his suit pocket, eagerly awaiting his response. [Liang Xia] looked disappointed at him, while he continued to speak absentmindedly.
0:5:21|0:5:29|[Liang Xia] slowly placed the box in the middle of the dining table, but in her mind, all she could see was the moment when [Mao Liang] confessed his feelings to her.
0:5:43|0:6:0|At this moment, [Liang Xia] sat in place, staring blankly at the table, while continuously nibbling on the bread in her hand. Suddenly, the balloon on the door frame burst, and the streamers inside floated down. Shortly after, [Liang Xia] rushed to the cloakroom, pushed aside the hanging clothes, and moved the safe out from inside.
0:6:0|0:6:19|Watching the sealed safe, he sighed deeply, tore off the seal, took out the key and opened the safe, then took out all the snacks inside and placed them in the living room. He then half-lying on the sofa in the middle, stuffing snacks into his mouth, staring blankly at the TV. Suddenly, the TV malfunctioned, the screen went blank.
0:7:9|0:7:36|[Liang Xia] successfully ordered magic chocolate, and the title of the senior sister is "28-Year-Old Minor", gradually unfolding under the influence of colors. On the other side, the gorgeously dressed best friend closed her eyes tightly, shaking the tortoiseshell in her hand, with copper coins rolling inside. Before long, she poured out all the copper coins, counting on her fingers and chanting spells.
0:7:36|0:7:39|Before [Liang Xia] could react, her best friend took out an ancient book.
0:8:12|0:8:16|Hearing her best friend say so, [Liang Xia] felt relieved but also melancholic.
0:8:29|0:8:41|The next day arrived quickly, and the guests arrived as scheduled, driving into the villa one by one. At this moment, [Liang Xia] was also in the convoy, and just as he was driving, a figure suddenly blocked his car.
0:8:41|0:8:50|[Liang Xia] stared in astonishment at the front, as the host gestured playfully. Then he walked to the window of the driver's seat and signaled for [Liang Xia] to roll down the window.
0:8:56|0:9:5|Liang Xia looked at him in disbelief as the gift box was handed to her, taking it and holding it close to inspect.
0:9:6|0:9:24|In short, he gestured with a smile, and when [Liang Xia] looked up, he had already disappeared. [Liang Xia] looked around, trying to find his figure. Then, he tore open the outer packaging, opened the box, and each chocolate was individually wrapped and displayed in the gift box.
0:9:28|0:9:51|Let's congratulate the newlyweds Liang Xia and Mao Liang today, but they are looking at the empty seat below the stage. Our groom has prepared a surprise for the bride. Then, the groom took out a pure gold turtle shell studded with diamonds from the box presented by the best man. The bride looked at the turtle shell excitedly and covered her mouth.
0:9:53|0:10:11|The groom affectionately expresses his love to the bride. Then, the two happily embrace and kiss. [Liang Xia] stands behind the bride, deeply moved. Seeing her best friend so happy, she raises her hands and applauds for her. At that moment, [Mao Liang] quietly walks in, catching [Liang Xia]'s attention immediately.
0:10:11|0:10:14|[Mao Liang] awkwardly made his way through the crowd to his seat.
0:10:26|0:10:28|Under the bright spotlight, [Liang Xia] felt a wave of joy in her heart.
0:10:36|0:10:39|[Mao Liang], who had just sat down, quickly stood up and walked towards the stage.
0:11:4|0:11:11|At this moment, it felt like the two of them were transported back to ten years ago, when [Mao Liang] confessed his feelings to [Liang Xia].
0:11:51|0:11:59|[Liang Xia] looked at [Mao Liang] expectantly, while [Mao Liang] forced a smile and then took the microphone.
0:12:7|0:12:25|After listening for a moment, the smile on his face disappeared instantly. He stared at [Liang Xia] seriously, but got no response. [Mao Liang] lowered his head guiltily, not daring to meet his eyes. Just then, [Mao Liang]'s phone suddenly rang, and he quickly took it out to check the incoming call display.
0:12:25|0:12:27|After speaking, he turned around and walked away while making a phone call.
0:12:30|0:12:46|At this moment, [Liang Xia] looked around in confusion, with her best friend looking at her with concern. Then [Liang Xia] immediately put on her coat and chased after. [Mao Liang] drove past him, making him anxious as he stomped his feet. The next moment, he ran towards his own car and got in, immediately catching up.
0:12:46|0:12:55|Before long, he caught up with [Mao Liang], but despite being within arm's reach, he couldn't get [Mao Liang] to stop. So he called [Mao Liang], only to hear something unexpected on the other end of the line.
0:12:58|0:13:13|Seeing that [Mao Liang] didn't answer the phone, he anxiously redialed. The phone kept ringing, and at that moment, [Mao Liang]'s car kept accelerating to overtake the cars in front of him, with someone closely chasing from behind. Suddenly, the car in front attempted to overtake, prompting him to slam on the brakes and honk the horn frantically.
0:13:13|0:13:17|After the car in front swerved away, he chased after it and scattered the chocolate along the way.
0:13:31|0:13:44|At this moment, [Mao Liang]'s car drove through the intersection, while [Liang Xia] was stopped by the red light. She watched the back of [Mao Liang]'s car, feeling a mix of emotions. While [Mao Liang] was completely disappointed this time, [Liang Xia] just wanted a resolution with him.
0:13:44|0:14:0|As [Liang Xia] stared blankly ahead, rain started to fall from the sky, with a cold raindrop hitting the car window first. In an instant, the rain intensified, pouring down from the sky, with raindrops the size of bamboo hats rhythmically striking the car body.
0:14:0|0:14:15|In the car, [Liang Xia] could no longer hide her inner vulnerability, and burst into tears, feeling like the whole world was abandoning her. In a panic, she looked around trying to find some comfort. Suddenly, she noticed the magic chocolate placed on the passenger seat, and immediately grabbed one and stuffed it into her mouth.
0:14:16|0:14:34|He covered his mouth and cried in pain, as dark clouds covered the sky and thunder suddenly sounded. Then a bolt of lightning cut through the sky, at this moment the red light also turned green. [Liang Xia] stopped crying under the urging of the car behind, driving forward with a vacant look, the wipers dutifully performing their duty.
0:14:34|0:14:43|Repeatedly wiping the rain off the windshield for [Liang Xia], but no one helped him wipe away his tears. Just then, the rain on the windshield miraculously flowed back.
0:14:44|0:14:59|The scene cuts to the eyes of [Liang Xia], with numerous nerve fibers emitting a strange light. Soon after, the scene shifts to [Liang Xia] sitting in the car. She blinks, but fails to notice the turn signal of the vehicle in front, and crashes into it.
0:14:59|0:15:5|She slowly looked up ahead, everything in front of her appeared blurry, even the car opposite seemed to have double images.
0:15:6|0:15:21|Just as [Liang Xia] was feeling dizzy, the driver who hit her had already gotten out of the car and stood by the window, frantically banging on it and shouting for [Liang Xia] to come down. [Liang Xia] looked at him in confusion, but could never see his face clearly. She had no choice but to open the car door and get out.
0:15:21|0:15:41|He stood by the car, still unable to hear what the driver was saying, but feeling that the sun was exceptionally bright today. Squinting at the sun, he found everything around him strangely unfamiliar. As he turned to look at the car, he unexpectedly caught a glimpse of himself reflected in the window. With a shocked expression, he bent down and observed carefully.
0:15:41|0:15:53|Looking at the familiar yet unfamiliar face, suddenly, the driver beside him gave him a push, followed by saying. [Liang Xia] turned his head, looking at him innocently.
0:16:0|0:16:18|After speaking, the driver who was hit took out his phone and made a call, while [Liang Xia] continued to admire herself, playing with her earrings indifferently. Upon hearing this, [Liang Xia] turned and ran away.
0:16:23|0:16:37|He ran away amidst curses, holding up his skirt as he ran. After finally making it through the vehicles, he realized he was lost when he turned around. He stood on the roadside, bending over and panting heavily, unexpectedly seeing on the screen across the street that the time for the European Cup was 2016.
0:16:50|0:17:12|Suddenly, the phone in [Liang Xia]'s pocket rang. She took out her phone and saw that it was a call from her best friend [Bai Xiaoning]. A smile appeared on her face, but she couldn't answer the call no matter what she tried. She anxiously searched for a solution on her phone.
0:17:41|0:17:52|The best friend covered her mouth in shock, then pinched [Liang Xia]'s face and looked at it from left to right. Recalling everything that had just happened, the best friend confidently said to [Liang Xia],
0:18:18|0:18:25|She opened her arms, imagining herself standing under the spotlight, while her best friend bit her finger and turned her head to the side.
0:18:48|0:18:54|[Liang Xia] looked at her best friend with a face full of grievances. He furrowed his brows tightly and said in disbelief,
0:19:17|0:19:37|The best friend kept shaking her head. She spread out her left hand and pointed with her fingers at the photo hanging on the wall. [Liang Xia] sat at the head of the bed, but her hand was tapping on the tablet. Startled, [Liang Xia] immediately withdrew her hand, looking puzzled as she picked up the tablet, while her best friend taught her how to use it.
0:19:46|0:19:51|Later, she brought the tablet to her chest, and her best friend then pulled her hand to place it on the start button.
0:20:1|0:20:17|Following that, [Liang Xia] took off her evening gown, changed into casual clothes, and combed her hair in front of the mirror. Her friend, who was leaning against the wall covering her eyes, slowly turned around. Liang Xia picked up her tablet and bag, and walked out.
0:20:31|0:20:44|When the two of them were having a good time, [Mao Liang] opened the door and walked in, causing [Liang Xia] to turn slowly. They then decided to have a good chat. [Liang Xia] sat cross-legged across from [Mao Liang], looking at him.
0:21:4|0:21:7|[Mao Liang] was a bit at a loss during the interview.
0:21:29|0:21:52|After speaking, [Liang Xia] stood up, with both hands on the table. Then she turned around, grabbed her bag, and left. [Mao Liang] furrowed his brow, looking in the direction [Liang Xia] was leaving. At that moment, her phone rang. On the other side, [Liang Xia] sat in a taxi, playing with her hair while enjoying the scenery outside.
0:22:23|0:22:25|[Liang Xia] immediately turned to look at her best friend.
0:22:32|0:22:41|The strong classical music rendered the crowd, the entire venue shimmering with neon lights, people in different costumes standing in the dance floor, swaying their bodies to the music.
0:22:52|0:23:9|Soon after, she stood in front of the crowd, moving to the music and inviting others to join in with her. Quickly, others were drawn to her dance and started moving involuntarily. Her best friend stood shyly on the side, unsure of what to do. But before long, he joined in [Liang Xia]'s dance.
0:23:9|0:23:21|The two mesmerizing dancers continued to influence those around them, as they all tried to learn the dance of [Liang Xia] and her best friend. Before long, a small group of people had picked it up, dancing behind [Liang Xia].
0:23:21|0:23:32|At this moment, [Liang Xia] was getting more and more excited, infecting everyone around him. He didn't expect to inspire so many people to dance to their anthem. Soon, everyone at the scene mastered the dance.
0:23:35|0:23:41|They followed the music and danced non-stop in the dance floor, although each of them was dressed in unique outfits, they danced in perfect harmony.
0:23:43|0:23:56|At this moment, with dynamic beats, Liang Xia and Mao Liang are dancing with light and lively steps, blooming with brilliant smiles, exuding youthful vigor all over, showcasing the beauty of sports, and experiencing the joy brought by dancing.
0:23:56|0:24:11|At 17, she was carefree and unconcerned about others' opinions of her, living the way she wanted to be. With her guidance, her best friend also began to break free. The two seemed to have returned to their youth, being bold and fearless.
0:24:11|0:24:32|After the music ended, [Liang Xia] excitedly looked up and shouted towards the sky. Everyone in the room raised their hands and applauded for him, and he excitedly high-fived the people around him. Meanwhile, [Mao Liang] was frantically searching for something in the office, with his female colleague helping him search.
0:24:32|0:24:47|[Mao Liang] stood with hands on hips, furrowing his brows and sighing. While [Liang Xia] and her friends were enjoying themselves with drinks, a phone suddenly rang. After hanging up the call, [Mao Liang] inadvertently saw [Liang Xia]'s moments on social media.
0:24:47|0:25:6|In each photo, there is [Liang Xia] with newly made friends. She angrily turns off her phone and throws it onto the nearby table. [Liang Xia] takes out a tablet from her bag and places it in front of her chest.
0:25:12|0:25:32|Suddenly, the tablet was snatched by the guy with blonde hair. [Liang Xia] was not angry, but instead felt even happier. Just after venting, [Liang Xia] became listless, with hallucinations appearing before her eyes. She stared blankly at the flashing lights above her head, with a buzzing sound in her ears. At that moment, her best friend suddenly appeared behind her.
0:25:45|0:26:8|[Liang Xia] looked around with a puzzled expression, and then her best friend started vomiting uncontrollably. At this moment, [Liang Xia] became even more confused, while her friend belatedly realized what was happening. She lifted her head, carefully observed [Liang Xia], and pinched her face, saying.
0:26:21|0:26:25|The best friends danced and gestured to depict the battle.
0:26:43|0:26:57|Just then, Liang Xia's phone rang. Liang Xia nervously answered the call and put the phone to her ear.
0:27:6|0:27:10|Following that, [Liang Xia] emptied the contents of her bag onto the ground, searching frantically.
0:27:17|0:27:21|[Liang Xia] looked at her best friend in confusion, then walked towards her.
0:27:43|0:27:54|Based on the problem-solving Liang Xia, she was completely confused by her best friend. At this moment, the two of them were sitting in a taxi, with Liang Xia wearily shaking her head.
0:28:13|0:28:28|The driver grabbed [Liang Xia] and her best friend reluctantly argued with him, but he still took away a few photos. For the happiness of [Liang Xia], her best friend decided to go all out, and the taxi abruptly braked at the intersection, causing the two people inside to lurch forward due to inertia.
0:28:28|0:28:33|After multiple experiments that left the two exhausted, when the car finally stopped, [Bai Xiaoning] immediately propped up her chin.
0:28:46|0:29:1|A BMW car came speeding in and stopped steadily in front of the taxi. [Bai Xiaoning] unleashed a sweet attack on her husband, and the two nodded frantically.
0:29:6|0:29:9|The driver glanced at the money in her hand, then looked at the BMW in front of them.
0:29:21|0:29:27|Before the driver could count the money happily, a police car quickly stopped between the two cars.
0:29:51|0:30:2|The female police officer opened the door, and [Mao Liang] walked slowly into the interrogation room. She looked helplessly at [Liang Xia]. [Liang Xia] lowered her head in shame, her eyes turning red in an instant. Seeing this, the interrogating police officer stood up and left.
0:30:3|0:30:9|The police walked up to [Mao Liang] and gave him a special reminder. Seeing this, [Bai Xiaoning] also got up and left.
0:30:18|0:30:26|[Liang Xia] lowered her head, tears swirling in her eyes, then [Mao Liang] handed her a paper bag, and [Liang Xia] took what he had in his hand.
0:30:34|0:30:46|[Liang Xia] looked bewilderedly to the side, then reached into the bag in his arms and took out a chocolate from the box. He unwrapped it and put it into his mouth, chewing with a vacant stare.
0:30:49|0:31:3|At this moment, [Liang Xia]'s hand was trembling by her mouth, with furrowed brows and wet eyelashes from tears. Almost on the verge of breaking down emotionally, she hugged [Mao Liang] tightly, afraid that he would leave in the next second. [Mao Liang] patiently comforted her.
0:31:22|0:31:36|[Mao Liang] kept touching his head to comfort [Liang Xia], who was still immersed in sadness, completely unaware of the subtle changes happening in his body. Tears struggled to well up in his eyes, and the tears flowed uncontrollably.
0:31:36|0:31:41|Suddenly, he opened his eyes and felt himself being held, then he pushed [Mao Liang] away.
0:31:46|0:31:57|After speaking, he walked towards the door and bumped [Mao Liang] hard on the way, before [Mao Liang] could react, his phone rang.
0:32:3|0:32:14|Shortly after, he turned and walked away with a smile. Angered, [Mao Liang] immediately chased after him. The friend hiding outside the door looked shocked as she watched [Liang Xia] disappear. Then, he walked straight into the interrogation room.
0:32:16|0:32:37|[Mao Liang] searched for the tablet based on the location. Following the navigation, [Mao Liang] accidentally stepped into a hole and fell down. He continued searching, but ended up in a pile of garbage, unable to believe it, he looked back at his phone again. Looking up, he saw a bag next to a beggar.
0:32:49|0:33:7|[Mao Liang] cleverly hid behind a tree to escape danger, then he emptied his bag and searched carefully. He continued to search along the navigation, only to see the boss vigorously chopping meat.
0:33:51|0:33:58|[Mao Liang] handed the money directly to the boss, afraid that he might regret it. But the boss took the money, deftly picked up a knife, and smashed the tablet with the handle.
0:34:1|0:34:17|The boss threw the tablet into [Mao Liang]'s arms, and he carefully opened it, standing there at a loss. On the other side, [Liang Xia] with delicate makeup and short hair, wearing a leopard print sweater coat and a spike collar, sat on the subway curiously looking around.
0:34:17|0:34:25|The young man next to him was playing with his phone. He quickly moved closer, but was rejected. He then smiled to himself. Just as he looked around, two men walked onto the subway.
0:34:26|0:34:37|She caught a glimpse of the profile of one of the men out of the corner of her eye, unexpectedly captivated. When the man turned his head, she immediately averted her gaze, shrinking into her chair, stealing glances.
0:34:37|0:34:53|17-year-old [Mao Liang] Liang Xia, with her first taste of love, couldn't forget the face of the young man for a long time. So she decided to capture this moment, taking out her makeup bag and sketchbook from her backpack. After getting ready, she sneakily looked at the young man, imprinting his silhouette in her mind and drawing it in her sketchbook.
0:34:54|0:35:9|He sketched simply and smoothly, and quickly, the outline of the man appeared on the paper. Then, he colored the drawing with eyeshadow. But just as he wanted to observe further, he met his gaze, so he awkwardly buried his head in the sketchbook.
0:35:10|0:35:29|The man saw her looking shy, unconsciously smiling, eyes avoiding contact, trying hard to disguise his emotions. However, her little actions had already been seen through by the companion beside her, who shook his head helplessly. At this moment, [Liang Xia] pushed aside her bangs, glanced at her sideways, and the man also noticed [Mao Liang] looking at him from the corner of his eye.
0:35:29|0:35:48|Shyly turning her head to the other side, [Liang Xia] covered her mouth to control her emotions and continued painting. When she looked up again, the man actually smiled happily, and [Liang Xia] responded with a smile. At that moment, [Liang Xia] felt dizzy in her head and immediately closed her eyes to ease the sensation.
0:35:48|0:35:59|However, the man's companion took out a phone to snap a picture of her, prompting the man to immediately reach out to intercept. Following that, [Liang Xia] slowly opened her eyes, looking at the unfamiliar surroundings, feeling nervous.
0:36:0|0:36:17|Suddenly, Liang Xia noticed his short hair in the mirror opposite, touching it in shock. At this moment, Mao Liang observed him with a frown as he noticed his unusual behavior. After exchanging a few curious glances, Bai Xiaoning took off the wig and chose to leave, with his sketchbook slipping off his lap onto the ground.
0:36:17|0:36:22|As he passed by the man, he was unexpectedly stopped. The man hinted at him, but he ignored and walked past.
0:36:22|0:36:40|On the side, Liang Xia's companion quickly picked up the fallen notebook and threw it to the man, but he was still a step too late. The subway doors closed abruptly. Wanting to call out to him, but not knowing his name, Liang Xia could only lean against the window, watching his departing figure. He looked disappointedly at his companion, then lowered his head and opened the notebook.
0:36:40|0:36:50|Inside is a complete portrait, with Liang Xia using colors to depict his dark side, making the whole picture more three-dimensional. He looks at the painting, and can't help but smile.
0:36:56|0:37:4|In the company, the superior was looking through the design drawings on the broken tablet, with [Mao Liang] standing beside him looking disheveled. After speaking, he took out his phone to start searching.
0:37:40|0:37:45|[Mao Liang] took the phone and scrolled through Weibo, unexpectedly coming across a photo of [Liang Xia], causing his eyes to widen in surprise.
0:38:0|0:38:28|Mr. Gao withdrew his finger, smiling at [Mao Liang], who stood there at a loss. When she walked into the interrogation room, the floor was a mess, and she picked up a chocolate wrapper from the ground and sniffed it in front of her nose.
0:38:49|0:38:57|Liang Xia looked at the chocolate in her best friend's hand with reluctance as her best friend spread her hands out on the table.
0:39:2|0:39:8|At this moment, Liang Xia's phone rang, and the incoming call made her instantly nervous.
0:39:11|0:39:26|In the restaurant, [Liang Xia] is holding a makeup mirror to tidy up her hair, then she adjusts her earring and occasionally looks towards the door. Before long, [Mao Liang] slowly walks towards her. [Liang Xia] puts away the makeup mirror, smiles and [Mao Liang] greets her without any grudges.
0:39:38|0:39:56|The two sat down, but [Liang Xia] across from them seemed restless, with wandering eyes. [Mao Liang] then took out his Weibo and placed his phone in front of [Liang Xia].
0:40:0|0:40:16|[Liang Xia] smiled awkwardly after seeing the content. Then, he stared at [Mao Liang] intently and swiped to the second photo. At that moment, [Liang Xia] felt a chill in his heart, he put his phone upside down on the table. Immediately after, he buried his head in his arms and let out a deep sigh.
0:40:16|0:40:20|[Mao Liang] saw him so hesitant, and disappointedly spoke out.
0:40:28|0:40:43|After speaking, [Mao Liang] prepared to eat, while [Liang Xia] lowered her head in silence. The assistant then took out a file from the bag. [Mao Liang] took it and started browsing through it, while [Liang Xia]'s arm rested on the table observing the two of them.
0:40:50|0:41:5|The assistant looked at [Mao Liang] expectantly, while [Liang Xia] knocked over the vinegar jar. He grabbed a handful of dried fruits from the plate and stuffed them into his mouth, feeling very wronged.
0:41:13|0:41:26|[Mao Liang] looked up at him in disbelief, furrowed his brows twice, then took out eyeshadow and eyebrow pencil from his bag and spread a napkin on the table.
0:41:26|0:41:36|When he picked up the pen to start drawing, he found himself at a loss. He nervously stared at the blank paper, trying hard to calm his emotions, but he just couldn't bring himself to draw.
0:41:41|0:42:0|Speak up, [Liang Xia] picked up her handbag and walked quickly towards the restroom. As soon as she entered the restroom, she encountered the cleaning lady. They exchanged a few words casually, while [Liang Xia] took out her phone. She placed the bag on the sink and at the same time, looked around to see if there was anyone else nearby. Once she confirmed it was clear, she opened the video recording function on her phone.
0:42:13|0:42:27|After speaking, he put his phone back in his bag, took out a lipstick, and wrote something on the mirror opposite. After doing all this, he took out a chocolate and placed it in front of his eyes, hoping it would help him turn the tide. Then, he closed his eyes and stuffed the chocolate directly into his mouth.
0:42:28|0:42:44|At this moment, it is March 2nd, Wednesday, 7:32 PM. After he swallowed the chocolate, he opened his eyes and looked at himself in the mirror. Then, [Mao Liang] appeared behind him, with hair draped over, slowly walking towards him and leaning against him.
0:42:45|0:43:1|[Mao Liang] stared at herself in the mirror with wide eyes, but just as she was happily twisting around, she noticed the words "check your phone" written on the mirror. Reluctantly, she picked up her phone from the sink and opened the video.
0:43:1|0:43:12|Shortly after, she swaggered over to the dining table, tossed her handbag to the side, and coolly sat on the stool. [Mao Liang] looked puzzled and exchanged a glance with his assistant, then pulled out his phone to check Weibo.
0:43:13|0:43:27|[Liang Xia] took the phone and carefully observed, discovering the other party's name from the Weibo ID. [Mao Liang]'s assistant was left bewildered by her questions, and [Liang Xia] concealed her smug expression.
0:43:30|0:43:45|He ran towards the door, with [Mao Liang] closely following his back, but he never spoke. The noisy city quieted down in the cold air, and the lights on the roadside seemed to be infected, emitting a faint glow, blazing as [Liang Xia] sped down the road.
0:44:1|0:44:22|Later, the two of them arrived at the construction site, where Yan Yan grabbed [Liang Xia] and ran inside. Looking around, the tall buildings stood towering, and in the night, the unfinished skyscrapers appeared particularly silent and solemn. Yan Yan covered [Liang Xia]'s eyes from behind, and they walked forward together, whispering in her ear as they walked.
0:44:25|0:44:36|At this moment, [Liang Xia] took small steps forward, nervously holding Yan Yan's arm but also smiling expectantly. Even if he stepped on a banana peel, he wasn't afraid of falling because he knew [Liang Xia] would protect him.
0:44:36|0:44:49|Following that, [Liang Xia] released the hands covering his eyes, he cautiously opened them, but was greatly shocked at the moment he saw clearly, the entire cityscape came into view, with three spotlights swaying not far away.
0:44:54|0:45:9|Moved by [Mao Liang], she turned her head to the side and looked at the city, smiling excitedly. [Liang Xia] then indulgently embraced her, pressing her face close to hers, both enjoying the beautiful scenery. At this moment, [Mao Liang] felt very uncomfortable and instinctively dodged.
0:45:9|0:45:13|Afterwards, [Liang Xia] confronted her face to face, but she was looking forward to [Liang Xia]'s next move.
0:45:16|0:45:27|Yanyan confessed affectionately, making [Mao Liang] ecstatic. She looked into Yanyan's eyes, but the next moment she shyly lowered her head. Then, the two embraced tightly, gazing at the beautiful scenery that belonged to them at that moment.
0:45:27|0:45:47|[Mao Liang] buried his face in her arms with a happy expression. Soon, Yan Yan stroked [Mao Liang]'s hair with both hands, while [Mao Liang] looked at her affectionately. Just as Yan Yan was about to kiss him, [Mao Liang] closed his eyes. Before the kiss could happen, a spotlight shone on their faces from below, causing both of them to frown.
0:45:47|0:45:53|Looking towards the direction of the spotlight, [Mao Liang] asked [Liang Xia] with wide eyes after seeing the police car.
0:46:1|0:46:12|Shortly after, [Liang Xia] sitting in the police station, shivering on the chair, wrapped in her clothes, observing everything around her. Yan Yan sat beside her, leaning against the wall, staring at her. Suddenly, she spoke.
0:46:16|0:46:29|Yanyan leaned on her shoulder and shook her head. Despite receiving an affirmative answer, [Liang Xia] was still worried, pacing back and forth anxiously.
0:46:35|0:46:47|[Liang Xia] was eager to open the door, but Yan Yan was not. She calmly walked towards [Liang Xia], pulled her towards the door, and kissed her without any defense, repeatedly rubbing and kneading her lips mercilessly.
0:46:47|0:47:0|[Liang Xia] was startled by the sudden kiss, but quickly accepted it. She closed her eyes and enjoyed the kiss. The moment their hands touched, she held Yan Yan's hand tightly. At that moment, the five-hour countdown ended.
0:47:6|0:47:17|After speaking, he looked at the clock hanging on the wall next to him, the time was 12:30. [Liang Xia] nervously lowered her head, at this moment, Yan Yan couldn't help but ask.
0:47:26|0:47:33|The police officer was about to tell [Mao Liang] the truth, but then saw the female officer approaching with [Liang Xia], causing her to hesitate and only be able to remind them once again.
0:47:38|0:47:51|After speaking, the two police officers wanted to leave. [Mao Liang] still didn't understand the meaning of the police's final reminder. He frowned and looked at [Liang Xia], and at that moment, Yan Yan also walked out. He stood at the door, watching [Liang Xia]'s back, with many questions in his heart.
0:47:58|0:48:3|[Liang Xia] pulled her clothes up in self-blame until her entire head was wrapped inside.
0:48:18|0:48:32|After speaking, [Mao Liang] observed his actions through the rearview mirror, while [Liang Xia] in the back seat looked up at him in disbelief. The next day, [Liang Xia] pulled out a box from under the bed with a joyful mood, then directly opened the lid and took out a sketchbook from inside.
0:48:33|0:48:50|On the cover, there is his exclusive signature and the year of painting, 2005. He looked through his past artworks, each one a memory. His paintings are full of vitality, achieving a unity of realism and expressionism, meticulousness and freehand brushwork, constantly elevating and leaping off the paper.
0:48:51|0:49:10|In the end, his gaze fell on a page with a rose. He looked at it for a long time, and finally decided to pick up his paintbrush. Ready to go, he crossed his arms and stared at the canvas. Then, he dipped his brush in paint and began to sketch on the paper. In no time, he completed a painting and admired it satisfactorily.
0:49:10|0:49:16|After drawing several pictures in a row, Liang Xia sought her best friend's opinion for appreciation. Her best friend carefully observed with a magnifying glass.
0:49:56|0:50:2|The best friend was also at a loss. She placed the painting tools on the table.
0:50:49|0:51:8|Immersed in her fantasy, [Liang Xia] suddenly opened her eyes and took out a bundle of hemp rope. Looking at the chocolate in her hand, [Liang Xia] sighed deeply, then stuffed the chocolate into her mouth. She chewed while looking at her best friend, who was staring at her with curiosity all over her face at that moment.
0:51:8|0:51:16|At this moment, a timer appeared in the top right corner of the screen. The next second, the best friend was tied to a chair. [Mao Liang] immediately became interested.
0:51:43|0:51:55|The best friend realized it and tried to cover up the embarrassment with a smile, but [Liang Xia] stared at her with a mischievous smile. [Liang Xia] plucked the feather off the ornament.
0:52:17|0:52:31|Immediately, [Liang Xia] raised the feather in her hand. Her best friend closed her eyes tightly and turned her head to the other side. However, [Liang Xia]'s action at this moment shocked her friend greatly. Instead of continuing to torment her friend, she actually loosened the restraints on her.
0:52:41|0:52:49|After speaking, the best friend stood up and walked towards the table. She immediately picked up the golden tortoise shell, ready to leave, but her thoughts were seen through by [Liang Xia] with just one glance.
0:52:49|0:53:7|[Liang Xia] stood up excitedly and slapped the stool in front of her. [Liang Xia] blocked her, snatched the golden tortoise shell from her friend's hand, and her friend, realizing what had happened, immediately snatched it back. In the tug-of-war that followed, the tortoise shell flew out, scattering copper coins and chocolates. The two of them each caught the scattered items.
0:53:7|0:53:16|The best friend looked at the copper coin on the ground and said. After that, she turned her head and saw [Liang Xia] showing off a piece of chocolate to her, then ran out.
0:53:24|0:53:41|Returning home, [Liang Xia] searched everywhere for chocolate, scattering the contents of the cupboard on the floor. She noticed a box in the oven, walked over and pulled it out, but when she opened it, it was empty. Immediately, she dialed the manufacturer's phone number.
0:53:52|0:53:57|He pressed 2 without hesitation, but there was no sound from the other side, so he repeatedly dialed.
0:54:8|0:54:20|[Liang Xia] lay on the sofa with a troubled heart, and at that moment, a timer appeared in the upper left corner again, showing 4 hours, 35 minutes, and 55 seconds. In a daze, she opened her eyes and set her sights on the drinks in the refrigerator.
0:54:51|0:55:7|The two exchanged a glance and quickly arrived at the stadium. Everyone was warming up, with Gao Zong answering a phone call first. However, the most eye-catching figure was Gao Zong's secretary, who showcased a graceful posture through stretching. At this moment, [Liang Xia] stood opposite him, looking at him disdainfully.
0:55:9|0:55:23|Shortly after, President Gao served the ball first, and [Mao Liang] promptly hit it back without any hesitation. The secretary on the other side failed to catch it, and everyone looked at him in shock. But when [Mao Liang] turned around to look, [Mao Liang] immediately wiped the smile off his face.
0:55:23|0:55:34|After speaking, President Gao prepared to serve again. [Mao Liang] awkwardly retreated to his position. This time, he did not show off, losing several rounds in a row to the opponent. The more he played, the less interested he became, so he sat on the side to rest.
0:55:47|0:56:0|Shortly after, [Mao Liang] picked up the drink next to him and took a sip, but at that moment, his phone rang.
0:56:24|0:56:29|At this moment, [Liang Xia] had no idea that Xiaoning had melted chocolate into the drink he had just taken a sip of.
0:56:49|0:56:57|Little [Mao Liang] angrily hung up the phone, but Gao Zong walked over. Little [Mao Liang] looked him up and down disdainfully.
0:57:2|0:57:14|The on-screen battle values of the two characters appeared, [Mao Liang] looked around anxiously, then, Liang Xia hit the ball with all his strength, scaring Gao Zong, causing his battle value to instantly decrease by 6. [Mao Liang] looked at Liang Xia in disbelief.
0:57:17|0:57:34|CEO adjusted his posture and prepared to receive the serve, while in the rest area, [Mao Liang] kept signaling to young [Mao Liang], but the latter ignored him, sneered, and served the ball. This time, CEO did not underestimate him, calmly catching the ball. The two of them played several rounds back and forth, but couldn't determine a winner.
0:57:34|0:57:42|Mao Liang and his assistant were shocked as their eyes followed the ball swinging back and forth, but the two on the court were getting more and more intense, determined to determine the winner.
0:57:43|0:58:10|Little [Mao Liang] Xia didn't want to entangle anymore, so she made a big move, and the ball flew towards the opposite side. Seeing this, Gao Zong rushed forward, but still couldn't catch it, falling heavily to the ground. At this moment, the battle value dropped to zero. Mao Liang and his assistant, with widened eyes, immediately went forward to check.
0:58:14|0:58:27|At this moment, the opposite court was left with only the ball and racket. On the other side, Yan Yan was driving with little [Mao Liang] Xia and his friends speeding across the bridge.
0:58:34|0:58:48|Night falls, the stars twinkle, like many little lanterns decorating the monotonous night sky. As the stars gradually increase, the earth also merges into the night. People set up tents under the starry sky, chatting freely.
0:58:57|0:59:15|Yanyan slowly raised the shirt with [Mao Liang]'s hand in her arms. She propped herself up and pressed [Mao Liang] underneath her. [Mao Liang] was at a loss and trembling, but Yanyan thought it was because [Mao Liang] was embarrassed. She continued her actions, but [Mao Liang] pushed her away in disbelief.
0:59:15|0:59:21|Liang Xia turned her head to the side, avoiding Yan Yan's gaze. Seeing her reaction, Yan Yan sat up and asked.
0:59:22|0:59:40|Little [Liang Xia] saw that he had misunderstood, immediately sat up, looked at him with a serious frown, and after Little [Liang Xia] finished speaking, she withdrew her gaze, lowered her head, and stated her reasons. The tense expression also eased, and then he placed his hands on Little [Liang Xia]'s shoulders, gently kissed her cheek.
0:59:40|0:59:51|Little [Liang Xia] closed her eyes, trying to accept it. Mao Liang's hand, which was about to touch Little [Liang Xia]'s chest, was caught by her just in time for her to notice the time on his watch.
0:59:52|1:0:10|Soon after, [Liang Xia] pushed him away with both hands, unzipped the tent, grabbed her jacket, and walked out, leaving only Yan Yan sitting alone in the tent. [Liang Xia] hurriedly ran to a place away from the crowd, panting heavily. She took out her phone, adjusted her breath, and then raised the phone to press the record button.
1:0:15|1:0:17|Little [Liang Xia] said shyly.
1:0:25|1:0:39|After speaking, she pressed the pause button and looked towards the camping direction. At this moment, a countdown appeared in the lower left corner of the screen, with less than half a minute left of her own time. Gradually, she focused and closed her tired, sleepy eyes, retreating and disappearing.
1:0:39|1:0:51|[Liang Xia] took off her wig and returned to the tent. She slowly bent down and looked at Yan Yan lying inside. Ignoring her, [Liang Xia] sat down on the sleeping bag inside the tent.
1:1:0|1:1:2|Yanyan looked affectionately at the profile of [Liang Xia].
1:1:30|1:1:42|[Liang Xia] was shocked by the sudden confession, and suddenly sat up, holding her face. After hesitating for a moment, she closed her eyes and kissed her cheek. Just as Yan Yan was feeling pleased with herself, [Liang Xia] threw her coat in front of her.
1:1:44|1:1:57|Yanyan stood still for a moment, while [Liang Xia] had already walked out with her bag. The next day, in order to prevent any accidents, [Liang Xia] poured all the drinks in the fridge into the sink, and then threw the bottles into the trash can.
1:1:57|1:2:8|Continuing, he took out a thick book from the bookshelf, opened it on his arm, revealing a hole inside the book filled with magical chocolates. Then, [Liang Xia] walked out with the book.
1:2:31|1:2:45|Little [Liang Xia] listened to the voice message while drawing, and quickly completed a painting. The two women in the painting, with their hands crossed and backs against each other, seemed just like them at the moment. Meanwhile, as [Liang Xia] was repairing a motorcycle, her phone rang. She took out her phone and saw that the caller was actually [Mao Liang].
1:3:13|1:3:18|[Liang Xia] hung up the phone with a disappointed look on her face, and at that moment, her companion came to find her.
1:3:28|1:3:38|The companion nodded uninterestingly and walked away, while [Liang Xia] continued with the task at hand. On the other side, [Bai Xiaoning] placed the words on [Mao Liang]'s desk.
1:3:47|1:3:58|With only two hours left for Liang Xia, she turned back and smiled lightly before walking out. Then, the two arrived at the Haunted Hospital, where the lighting was extremely dim and the atmosphere exceptionally eerie.
1:3:58|1:4:9|Liang Xia immediately shook off her hand, Mao Liang looked at Liang Xia questioningly, but Liang Xia pushed her out. At this moment, a hand rested on her shoulder.
1:4:11|1:4:29|Suddenly, the scar-faced man approached Liang Xia with a gaping mouth full of blood. Pointing with his finger to the other side, Liang Xia handed the prosthetic hand back to him and turned to leave. But as he opened the door, the people inside grinned and shouted at him, and he excitedly walked into the middle of the crowd.
1:4:42|1:4:55|He lay on the hospital bed, surrounded by everyone. At this moment, a timer appeared in the lower right corner, counting down to [Mao Liang]'s turn, only a few seconds left. Soon, [Mao Liang] opened his eyes, saw this scene, and was terrified.
1:4:55|1:5:1|He quickly started to dodge the zombies, grabbing medical supplies nearby and throwing them up.
1:5:9|1:5:34|The staff in the haunted house quickly ran out, followed by [Liang Xia] who chased after them menacingly. However, a iron gate blocked the staff's way. [Liang Xia], shocked, looked inside to confront the ghosts. Then, [Liang Xia] picked up something nearby and threw it at them.
1:5:47|1:6:7|[Liang Xia] calmly nibbled on the chicken wings, while the man opposite, encouraged by his companions, raced to eat them. Yan Yan stood by, indulgently watching the young [Liang Xia]. Before long, the man couldn't hold on any longer and collapsed in pain.
1:6:10|1:6:17|[Liang Xia] leisurely took a sip of her drink, then confidently ate a piece of magical chocolate and raised her sword in triumph.
1:6:17|1:6:31|At that moment, under the influence of the spicy food, Liang Xia suddenly felt a stomachache. She rushed to the toilet and opened the door, but the dilapidated condition of the toilet made her stop in her tracks. However, the pain in her stomach was unbearable.
1:6:31|1:6:58|Terrified, [Liang Xia] immediately closed the door and turned to open another one. She looked at the old toilet helplessly, but at this moment, her stomach churned again. She could only endure the terrible environment and go to the bathroom. Meanwhile, [Bai Xiaoning] searched around for him. Reluctantly, [Bai Xiaoning] got on the motorcycle.
1:7:10|1:7:28|[Liang Xia], who was in the bathroom, heard the sound of a motorcycle outside the window and instantly panicked. He was about to stand up and shout, but then a strong pain came from his stomach. Helplessly, he had to sit down again, using one hand to support himself on the partition to ease the pain. Afterwards, the two communicated through voice messages.
1:7:29|1:7:36|With the help of Liang Xia, Mao Liang quickly completed all of Gao's requirements, and the two of them officially signed the contract.
1:8:1|1:8:20|[Bai Xiaoning] looked at him with relief, the two of them exchanged excited smiles. CEO Gao held [Liang Xia]'s hand tightly, instilling confidence in everyone. [Liang Xia] looked at [Mao Liang] as if a weight had been lifted off his shoulders, he had finally achieved it, also demonstrating his own value.
1:8:20|1:8:30|Shortly after, [Liang Xia] and her best friend sat quietly outside, laughing heartily in the private room. [Liang Xia] also felt good, nodding in satisfaction. Through the crack in the door, her friend caught a glimpse of [Mao Liang]'s figure, and the two immediately leaned against the door frame.
1:9:22|1:9:31|The two of them lowered their heads in disappointment, then returned home. He watched the video of [Mao Liang] confessing to him ten years ago.
1:10:29|1:10:34|At this moment, [Liang Xia] was already in tears, and then she rewound the video to the beginning.
1:10:38|1:10:56|While watching, the two of them kept stuffing snacks into their mouths. After finishing, he reached out to the pile of snacks beside him and mistakenly picked up the magic chocolate from the bag. Without even looking, he stuffed it directly into his mouth. After a while, he realized the taste was off, so he looked down at the packaging in his hand. Then, he quickly bent over the trash can and started vomiting uncontrollably.
1:11:2|1:11:17|Suddenly, [Liang Xia] felt a moment of confusion. She abruptly lifted her head, stood up unsteadily, with a buzzing sound still ringing in her ears. At that moment, the timer appeared, and young [Liang Xia] pushed back her hair, looking bewilderedly at the messy ground.
1:11:32|1:11:42|In the evening, [Mao Liang] returned home from work. As soon as he closed the door, he saw a card on the floor with the words "take a good look" written on it. He then opened the file bag on the table and took out the DVD with a confession video from [Mao Liang], finally realizing the truth.
1:11:56|1:12:12|At this moment, he was also pulled back into memories from ten years ago. The next day, the two of them were wearing aprons for painting, holding a cloth in their left hand and a paintbrush in their right hand, lying in the middle of the studio. Before long, he woke up groggily, but upon seeing the painting on the wall clearly, he immediately became alert, got up, and admired the painting in front of him.
1:12:12|1:12:17|The scene is dominated by two teenage girls, Liang Xia and Bai Xiaoning, who are in completely different environments.
1:12:18|1:12:29|The girl on the left is full of vitality and vigor, surrounded by blooming flowers. The girl on the right is full of charm, sometimes shy and sometimes gentle as water, exuding a mature aura of a young woman.
1:12:29|1:12:40|The two of them approached each other, reaching out to try to accept each other, the painting of the two of them resembling them at this moment. They were completely absorbed in watching, when suddenly, he noticed a message left on the small drawing board.
1:12:44|1:13:0|He smiled with relief and lowered his head. Encouraged by [Liang Xia], he decided to start over. He put a new piece of paper on the small drawing board, fixed it with pushpins at the four corners, and squeezed the required colors onto the palette.
1:14:26|1:14:33|[Mao Liang] stopped the closing elevator door and [Liang Xia] inside looked at him calmly, just as [Mao Liang] was about to speak.
1:14:34|1:14:53|The assistant calmly walked into the elevator, and [Liang Xia] responded to her greeting with a smile. As soon as she turned around, she immediately put away her smile. Soon, the elevator reached the first floor. She then quickly left the elevator. In the mall, the cosmetics packaging featuring [Liang Xia]'s work was well received by the public.
1:15:8|1:15:22|On the other side, [Liang Xia] sat in front of the mirror just finishing her makeup, with the makeup artist about to curl her hair with a curling iron. At that moment, her best friend walked over with a tablet.
1:15:25|1:15:27|At this moment, the factory was shrouded in thick smoke.
1:16:0|1:16:15|The best friend paused the live stream, looking at [Liang Xia] with a worried expression. At this moment, [Liang Xia] was also at a loss. Then, the two sat in the car on their way to the art exhibition, and the best friend took out a chocolate and asked.
1:16:20|1:16:33|After speaking, [Liang Xia] looked at her best friend with certainty. The two exchanged smiles, and she took the magic chocolate from her friend's hand, unwrapping the packaging. She looked at the chocolate in her hand, anticipating the arrival of little [Liang Xia], and then ate it in one bite.
1:16:33|1:16:45|As the luxury car slowly arrived, the surrounding reporters and fans excitedly expressed their admiration. Then the car door opened, revealing a pair of sneakers. Liang Xia blew kisses in response to the enthusiasm of each fan.
1:16:48|1:17:6|The scale of this art exhibition is huge, with all of the walls covered with works by [Liang Xia], each painting captivating the viewers. The bustling crowd comes in waves to admire the art, everyone immersed in the artistic atmosphere. The exhibition center also prepared a variety of food and drinks for everyone.
1:17:11|1:17:26|[Liang Xia] turned around and waved to the reporters behind her. Finally, she lifted her skirt and walked up to the platform, taking out her phone to record a video with her back facing everyone.
1:17:51|1:17:55|She turned around to face everyone, while [Mao Liang] looked pensive at the ground.
1:18:11|1:18:27|In the midst of her joy of success, Liang Xia suddenly had a drastic change in her expression, and her smile disappeared instantly. Seeing her unusual behavior, the others began to whisper and discuss in private. Her best friend quickly came out to defuse the situation.
1:18:46|1:18:54|[Liang Xia] nervously walked down the stage, and her best friend's heart was also clenched at this moment, her eyes closely following [Liang Xia].
1:18:55|1:19:2|The crowd looked at [Liang Xia] with great anticipation, but at this moment, [Liang Xia] felt extremely nervous and didn't even dare to look up at President Gao.
1:19:3|1:19:22|After speaking, she walked through the crowd and out. While everyone was discussing, she remained indifferent. Shortly after, she entered the restroom and took out a magical chocolate, placing it by the sink. After staring at it for a while, she lifted her head and looked at herself in the mirror, her confused eyes also showing a hint of determination.
1:19:22|1:19:26|Then, she slowly picked up her phone and pressed the record button to start filming.
1:19:30|1:19:46|After speaking, she smiled at the screen, then pressed the pause button. She looked at herself in the mirror, constantly encouraging herself. With the help of Liang Xia, she decided to break through the current situation and rediscover her former self. So, she returned to the art exhibition and walked into the crowd.
1:19:46|1:20:6|She raised her head high, and when she saw [Mao Liang] looking at her with concern, she shyly lowered her head. As she walked up to her best friend, she stopped in her tracks, handed the magic chocolate in her hand to her, and gestured for her to look at him in surprise. Then he confidently walked up to the podium and stood directly in front of the easel.
1:20:6|1:20:21|He looked at the dimensions of the canvas, and in his mind involuntarily appeared what he wanted to express at this moment, with [Bai Xiaoning] standing aside smiling contentedly. His best friend below looked pleased, holding magical chocolates in her hand, as he picked up the brush and gently sketched on the paper.
1:20:23|1:20:38|He focused on the tip of the pen, oblivious to everything around him, only the sound of the pencil rubbing against the paper remained, reclaiming his world. At this moment, [Liang Xia] unexpectedly caught the attention of [Mao Liang] below, and the assistant, seeing [Mao Liang]'s infatuated look, was full of jealousy.
1:20:38|1:20:43|Unconsciously, Liang Xia has started to add colors to the painting, enriching the details of the picture.
1:21:8|1:21:20|After the art exhibition ended, [Mao Liang] personally drove [Liang Xia] home. At this moment, sitting in the back seat, [Liang Xia] couldn't help but feel secretly delighted as she looked out the window. Suddenly, [Mao Liang] put down the sun visor and looked at [Liang Xia] through the rearview mirror.
1:21:20|1:21:26|At this moment, [Liang Xia] was drawn by his actions, slowly turned to look at the rearview mirror, and then back at him.
1:21:33|1:21:39|[Liang Xia] pursed his lips and looked out the window. He finally got [Mao Liang]'s explanation, but he had already let it go.
1:22:12|1:22:30|He finally took off all the disguises and faced his true self. Then, [Mao Liang] parked the car by the roadside, turned around in confusion, and looked at him sitting in the back. [Liang Xia] calmly finished speaking, then turned and opened the car door to get out. He closed the door and walked away from the car in the opposite direction without any nostalgia.
1:22:30|1:22:38|At this moment, [Mao Liang] sitting in the car was feeling a mix of emotions. Back at home, [Liang Xia] sat in the studio watching all the videos of her interacting with little [Liang Xia].
1:23:16|1:23:32|Turn off the phone, in [Liang Xia]'s mind flashes a beautiful scene with little [Liang Xia]. Then, she looks up at the paintings covering the entire wall, all of which are the result of their joint efforts, a beautiful memory belonging to the two of them. Suddenly, she remembered the words her best friend had reminded her of before.
1:23:35|1:23:57|She then shifted her gaze to the magic chocolate on the corner of the table, making a decision silently. On the other side, Liang Xia's motorcycle team, led by Bai Xiaoning, parked by the roadside, and everyone gathered in groups to play and frolic.
1:23:57|1:24:4|[Bai Xiaoning] changed her usual style and leisurely walked towards them, but she suddenly saw a girl approaching Yan Yan, and the two of them seemed very ambiguous.
1:24:8|1:24:14|He stood there at a loss, and when he saw them approaching him, he immediately ran to the corner of the wall to secretly observe them.
1:24:19|1:24:36|A group of motorcycles sped forward, and when there was no sound, [Bai Xiaoning] slowly turned her head, staring intently at the back of the girl on the motorcycle. It wasn't until the motorcycle team disappeared from view that she withdrew her gaze. At this moment, her eyes were vacant, allowing tears to slide down her cheeks.
1:24:36|1:24:40|Back home, [Liang Xia] curled up on the floor, surrounded by scattered snacks.
1:24:41|1:24:56|Before long, he stretched his body and saw the spirit stone in front of him. He looked puzzled and slowly got up from the ground. At the same time, he observed the messy ground, then suddenly stared at the wall and walked forward. He looked disheveled, with his eye makeup smudged on his face.
1:24:56|1:25:9|At this moment, a earth-shattering change had already taken place on the opposite wall. The girl in the picture pointed to her head with her fingers, tears streaming down her eyes. This painting vividly reflects the mood of [Liang Xia] at this moment.
1:25:16|1:25:26|Later, [Mao Liang] arrived at Yan Yan's club and saw Yan Yan and the girl sitting at the table, chatting and laughing.
1:25:58|1:26:3|Liang Xia stood there in confusion, watching his back as he wiped the water off his face.
1:26:7|1:26:24|Suddenly, a fist came towards Yan Yan. Yan Yan lying on the ground raised her hand to signal her companions to stop, and then her companions started the motorcycles to help her.
1:26:33|1:26:56|The two quickly engaged in a fight, evenly matched in strength. [Mao Liang] tightly held onto Yan Yan's waist, pushing her against the wall. Yan Yan also kept using her elbows to hit his back. Suddenly, [Mao Liang] grabbed Yan Yan's clothes. On the other side, [Liang Xia] arrived at her best friend's house.
1:26:58|1:27:2|[Liang Xia] stopped in the middle of the living room, let out a deep sigh, and turned to look at her best friend.
1:27:7|1:27:32|The best friend took the phone handed over by [Liang Xia], then [Liang Xia] swallowed the chocolate in one bite. Immediately after, little [Liang Xia] stared at the phone intently. The best friend turned to look at little [Liang Xia] and comforted her by placing a hand on her arm.
1:27:34|1:27:58|The best friend looked helpless, while [Liang Xia] glared at her fiercely, making her immediately turn her head away. Finally, she arrived in front of the Yan Yan Club and knocked on the door frantically. When she saw Yan Yan open the door, she immediately pushed her inside.
1:28:3|1:28:20|She was talking while taking off her clothes. When she tried to take off Yan Yan's clothes, her hands were caught. Liang Xia gently held her face.
1:28:30|1:28:50|The girl rushed forward and gave a slap to little [Liang Xia], finally pushing away Yan Yan's arm blocking in front of her. Little [Liang Xia] endured the unwillingness in her heart. With tears welling up, she looked at Yan Yan, but Yan Yan avoided her gaze, so she turned and walked away.
1:29:17|1:29:23|The speechless Liang Xia looked at her best friend with a face full of grievances, while at this moment, her best friend was so angry that she couldn't say a word.
1:29:25|1:29:41|The anger in her best friend's heart was boiling, she tried to suppress it, but could only turn her head to the other side. Seeing her unaffected, Liang Xia vented her anger towards the bookshelf. Suddenly, a book containing chocolates fell to the ground, and Liang Xia immediately went to pick it up.
1:29:47|1:30:4|The best friend tightly held the hand of [Liang Xia] to stop her, but at this moment, [Liang Xia] looked at her fiercely. The best friend looked at her with eyes full of heartache, tears stubbornly falling from the corner of her eyes. Afraid that she might do something extreme, the best friend could only helplessly let go. She slowly stood up, but her eyes never left.
1:30:4|1:30:10|Liang Xia, who got the chocolate, crazily stuffed it into her mouth without even tearing off the wrapping paper on the outside.
1:30:14|1:30:29|The best friend looked at her disheveled appearance, tears streaming down her face. The next day, [Liang Xia] quickly ran into the train station, searching everywhere for [Bai Xiaoning]'s figure. The scene of their reunion came to mind, everything felt like it was just yesterday.
1:30:46|1:30:53|Suddenly, [Liang Xia] saw [Bai Xiaoning] by the train.
1:31:9|1:31:24|[白晓柠] on the opposite side did not hear her call, continued to hold her girlfriend's hand and walk forward. Then, [Liang Xia] felt dizzy, her consciousness blurred. Just as she was about to fall, she grabbed the handrail beside her in time, then knelt down on the ground, and shouted with all her strength.
1:31:26|1:31:36|[Bai Xiaoning], who was being scanned, seemed to hear her voice. But when she turned around to search for her in the crowd, she didn't find her. Disappointed, [Bai Xiaoning] turned back and walked into the train.
1:31:36|1:31:49|While [Liang Xia] remained unmoved upon seeing [Bai Xiaoning] through the crowd, she struggled to uphold her belief, only to collapse and fall heavily to the ground. In the moment of losing consciousness, [Liang Xia] seemed to have entered her inner world.
1:31:50|1:32:5|Surrounded by thick smoke, the figure of [Liang Xia] was only revealed after breaking through the layers of smoke. She was tightly hugging her knees, curled up on the ground, still gasping for air. At this moment, her heart felt extremely lonely, like an abandoned child.
1:32:36|1:32:48|Upon hearing Liang Xia's call, little Liang Xia slowly stood up. Liang Xia breathed a sigh of relief when she saw her. Little Liang Xia stood still, already crying like a tearful person.
1:32:51|1:32:54|Her body was filled with various medical solutions by the doctor, her face extremely pale.
1:33:26|1:33:40|Empathetic [Liang Xia] patiently persuades little [Liang Xia], gradually approaching her and reaching out with open arms to welcome her back. Little [Liang Xia] seems to take in her words, clenches her fists, and slowly moves towards her.
1:33:40|1:33:50|Little [Liang Xia] reached out to touch, but just as the two were about to make contact, they were separated by a transparent wall. [Liang Xia] touched the wall in surprise.
1:33:58|1:34:11|The nurse immediately injected adrenaline, and along the IV tube, you could see [Liang Xia] at this moment as if she were in the middle of the ocean. [Liang Xia] urgently raised her hands high, hitting the transparent wall.
1:34:13|1:34:25|Suddenly, the transparent wall was struck and cracked, and [Liang Xia] exerted all her strength to hit it. As the transparent wall shattered, the hospital's [Liang Xia] instantly had a cardiac arrest, and the defibrillator made a piercing sound.
1:34:25|1:34:35|The doctor's hands overlapped, pressing firmly against the patient's chest using the upper body strength, while on the other side, Liang Xia, floating in the water, let the sea water carry her away.
1:34:36|1:34:46|[Ma Liang] reached out to [Liang Xia] at the same time, hoping he could save himself. At that moment, [Liang Xia] exerted all his strength to swim towards little [Liang Xia], then he reached out his hands tightly and held her in his arms.
1:34:50|1:35:7|Just as the two were immersed in the joy of reunion, a subtle change occurred in little [Liang Xia]'s body. She looked at her disintegrating hand, furrowing her brows. At that moment, [Liang Xia] also noticed this phenomenon, looking incredulously at little [Liang Xia], then cupping her face to observe carefully.
1:35:7|1:35:12|In the hospital bed, [Liang Xia] looked pale, without a trace of color in her face, with an oxygen tube inserted in her nose.
1:35:25|1:35:34|Little [Liang Xia] finished speaking, and [Liang Xia] looked at her with a touched expression. Just as she was about to disappear, Little [Liang Xia] used all her strength to push [Liang Xia] upwards.
1:35:34|1:35:50|At this moment, [Liang Xia] did not resist again. She knew that little [Liang Xia] had never left her from the beginning to the end. Instead, it was her own timidity that prevented her from facing reality and losing herself. [Liang Xia] knew that this separation was a farewell forever. She stared at the face of little [Liang Xia], watching her gradually disappear.
1:36:16|1:36:29|At this moment, [Liang Xia] floating in the water is surrounded by many bubbles, as if little [Liang Xia] has turned into small bubbles to protect her and float her towards the surface. In the hospital, the [doctor] sees that the heart resuscitation is not effective and prepares to use electric shock to stimulate the heart.
1:36:33|1:36:43|At this moment, the words of a nurse drew the attention of everyone present to the bedside heart monitor, which no longer displayed a flat line and the heart rate was gradually increasing.
1:36:43|1:37:0|Lying on the hospital bed, [Liang Xia] had tears in the corners of her eyes. She struggled to open her eyes, still unable to recover from the pain of losing little [Liang Xia]. Tears rolled down her cheeks. Then, she closed her eyes and turned her head to the other side, but the sadness was still overwhelming.
1:37:1|1:37:16|Then, she furrowed her brows, cried softly, and after a while, she slowly opened her eyes. At this moment, she remembered what little [Liang Xia] had said, that she would never leave him. After that, she relaxed her brows and her emotions also eased a lot.
1:37:16|1:37:23|From this point on, [Liang Xia] regained her dreams, finding back everything she had lost in the past ten years.
1:37:36|1:37:48|Years later, [Liang Xia]'s artistic photos appeared on the covers of major magazines, and his design works were almost universally adopted by the entire industry. From a shut-in to a famous designer, his success was there for all to see.
1:37:49|1:38:0|Yan Yan passed by the street and accidentally noticed Liang Xia's magazine being displayed on the big screen of the mall. She stared at the screen thoughtfully, then reluctantly put on her helmet, started the engine, and drove away.
1:38:18|1:38:21|[Liang Xia] looked back excitedly.
1:38:48|1:38:57|He leaned against the window and looked down, then [Mao Liang] shouted loudly.
1:39:5|1:39:18|After speaking, [Liang Xia] flipped her hair and glanced at him from the corner of her eye, then looked outside at [Mao Liang]. At this moment, [Mao Liang] still held up the sign saying "I love you, [Liang Xia]" firmly, standing in place waiting for her response.
1:39:18|1:39:25|Finally, the scene shows a message written by Liang Xia to Liang Xia against the backdrop of a traditional Chinese ink painting.
