0:1:58|0:2:3|A Japanese soldier with a helmet on his head is taking a break, facing the cold winter sun as he marches forward.
0:2:4|0:2:15|Long-term walking made him too busy to think. He just waited for a command, then put the backpack behind his head, held the long spear in front of his chest, and seized the opportunity to lie down on the ground.
0:2:15|0:2:25|In his sleep, Tang Tianxiang seemed to have dreamt of something, or perhaps it was the hard stones beneath him that prevented him from sleeping peacefully. Unconsciously, the soldier parted his lips and slowly opened his eyes.
0:2:27|0:2:44|Next, there came the call of his companions in his ears, and [Kadokawa Masao] swiftly adjusted himself and shouldered his equipment to move forward again. Before long, the whole team arrived at a dusty trench, where soldiers with long spears were already lined up in the one-meter-high trench.
0:2:46|0:2:53|[Kadokawa Masao] jumped down and then bent over to pass through a pillar bridge tunnel. Suddenly, he heard his companion sighing ahead.
0:2:56|0:3:14|He ignored them and instead took the water bottle from another soldier's hand, hastily gulping down a few mouthfuls. After the swallow, he squinted his eyes and looked ahead. The earthen city wall 100 meters away had already been reduced to half ruins under the bombardment of shells.
0:3:16|0:3:39|The raging flames of war burned, carrying the remnants of ammunition in the air, all pressed against the top of the city wall. Several fighter jets almost skimmed over the top of the head towards the city, as if to attack again. Outside the city, the battle began first, with two armored vehicles arriving directly at the city gate, and several other vehicles stationed around the trenches firing.
0:3:41|0:3:57|The crumbling old city wall quickly fell apart like flowing sand under the attack of artillery. [Kadokawa Masao] and a group of soldiers, holding long spears, silently crouched in the trenches. With eyes wide open, they watched as the city wall gradually collapsed.
0:3:57|0:4:9|At this moment, inside Nanjing city, under the Yijiang Gate in the north of the city, soldiers under the command of Song Xilian of the 36th Division of the Nationalist Army were huddling in groups by the city gate. Suddenly, a group of people surged towards the soldiers from inside the city.
0:4:12|0:4:22|At the captain's command, the soldiers standing by the city gate tightened their arms and faced the incoming people inside the city. With layers inside and outside, the city gate was completely blocked.
0:4:23|0:4:38|As the crowd gradually approached the city gate, a young soldier standing at the front of the line tightened his grip on the long spear and stepped forward to meet them. However, as the crowd got closer and closer, [the young soldier] began to waver, his hands gripping the gun barrel, unable to stop trembling up and down.
0:4:38|0:4:44|At this moment, looking back at the crowd, a group of soldiers in military uniforms holding guns and batons approached.
0:5:8|0:5:23|In the crowd, whether by accident or design, the already restless sides were ignited by the sound of gunfire. Escapees ran from the sea, brandishing their guns and sticks, and ruthlessly knocked down the [Private] who was guarding.
0:5:28|0:5:42|The squad underestimated the determination of the deserters. The human wall they formed with their arms was quickly broken through. Among the wall, the officer Tang Tianxiang and the chubby soldier Shun Zi were pushed to the outermost edge of the crowd.
0:5:42|0:5:56|As Tang Tianxiang picked up the long spear and stood up, turning around, the fleeing soldiers had already rushed towards the city gate like madmen. However, not only was the city gate tightly closed in front of them, but also layers of attack formations built with sacks were blocking their way.
0:5:58|0:6:16|The deserter lying in front was pushed to the ground and trampled on by the people behind him. In no time, a human ladder was formed. The deserters, at this moment, disregarded the lives beneath their feet, using both hands and feet to crazily smash the sacks blocking the city gate tunnel.
0:6:16|0:6:23|Before Ma Dai could finish cleaning up, the deserter found a gap and forcefully squeezed in, falling down the palace chambers and then fleeing straight towards the door.
0:6:25|0:6:44|On the other side, after using cannons to demolish the city wall, Japanese soldiers leaned against the ruins, raising their long spears and waving flags in celebration. Inside a household, upon hearing that the army had also fled, the common people hurriedly followed with donkeys and carrying burdens.
0:6:44|0:6:50|The people who arrived in time had donkeys carrying pots, pans, tables, and chairs on their backs, essential items for life, going out alive and well.
0:6:52|0:7:13|The people who were in a hurry could only pick up important items and stuff them into cloth bags, hastily leaving. Among the refugees with their families, some mothers simply put their two or three-year-old children on a carrying pole and ran, fearing they would be delayed. Those without children tied several chickens and ducks to the carrying pole, ready to flee along the escape route.
0:7:13|0:7:18|[Lujian Xiong] stood beside the stone steps at the city gate, looking down at the hurried refugees fleeing.
0:7:24|0:7:39|After a brief chaos, the city temporarily calmed down. Suddenly, a coachman drove a yellow carriage into the city against the traffic. On the seat of the carriage, there was a tattered flagpole with a worn-out flag attached. The flag had a circle drawn around the edges, with a cross right in the center.
0:7:40|0:7:58|In the same yellow van, there are a total of four vans. The first van is occupied by a middle-aged woman with short curly hair and wearing pearl earrings. The second van is occupied by a girl who looks similar to her, and she is holding a little girl who is about three or four years old in her arms. They all curiously look around.
0:8:1|0:8:19|Seeing the crowd coming in the opposite direction and the fleeing civilians, a few children curiously looked around, but before they could see clearly, they were shouted at by their father to leave quickly. Not far away, several Japanese soldiers holding long spears were curiously searching along the street.
0:8:19|0:8:25|Passing by a small tavern that had long been unrecognizable, one of the soldiers suddenly had a bright idea.
0:8:28|0:8:38|As the soldier was about to open the cap of the glass bottle, he was loudly stopped by the Japanese officer. Seeing the officer walk away, the soldier couldn't wait and quickly took a big gulp.
0:8:41|0:8:54|After receiving a positive response, Tang Tianxiang and his companions quickly arrived at the shelf in front of the small tavern, picked up a bottle and started drinking quickly. The Japanese officer heard the commotion and turned to look, then asked in a deep voice.
0:9:1|0:9:13|The Japanese officer who was originally going to investigate suddenly saw a middle-aged man wearing a helmet riding a bicycle passing by. When he turned his head, he saw a car coming from the main road.
0:9:14|0:9:36|After shouting to no avail to stop the car, a soldier fired a shot into the air as a warning. When the car came to a stop, a foreign old man in a suit and tie raised his hands high and walked towards the Japanese officer, asking if anyone spoke English while showing the flag on his arm to indicate that he was German.
0:9:36|0:9:40|Knowing that [Kadokawa Masao] could speak English, the Japanese officer asked him to approach and inquire about this elderly German man.
0:9:49|0:9:57|After [Kadokawa Masao] translated these words to everyone, a soldier suddenly laughed and said he also wanted to meet the general.
0:10:4|0:10:12|At this moment, the middle-aged man who got off the car with the elderly German approached cautiously and spoke in Japanese.
0:10:13|0:10:22|Upon hearing his native language, Kadokawa Masao, the Japanese officer, immediately relaxed his brows, smiled at the two, put away his gun, waved his hand, and then led the soldiers away from the scene.
0:10:23|0:10:40|As soon as Ke Gang turned his head, a soldier suddenly noticed a figure flashing by the collapsed church in front of the clock tower in Qingdao. Therefore, the Japanese officer quickly raised his hand to signal, while drawing a pistol from his waist and slowly moving towards the church in front.
0:10:40|0:10:47|The leather boots made a rustling sound as they stepped on the broken stones on the ground, while the soldiers clenched their teeth and loaded their rifles.
0:10:51|0:11:11|The door of the church was gently pushed open, and a group of women and children stood shoulder to shoulder, silently looking at the newcomer. The sunlight shone through the broken windows, revealing their current appearance. The clean and tidy cotton jackets of the elderly were already tattered, their hair disheveled and hanging in front of their foreheads, their eyes sunken like dried-up wells.
0:11:11|0:11:28|The stick-like hand firmly grasped the child in front, and the next second couldn't help but keep retreating. It turned out that [Kadokawa Masao] had already walked in front of everyone. The sudden silence on the child's back scared him into crying out.
0:11:28|0:11:47|Then, in the crowd, an old man with a beard raised his hands above his head first, and then others followed suit. For a moment, the hands raised by the people actually blocked the sunlight outside the church. Among the crowd, several injured soldiers were in tears as they raised their rifles above their heads.
0:11:49|0:11:57|Seeing this scene in front of him, [Kadokawa Masao] put down his gun, but other soldiers still held their guns upright, aiming at the unarmed civilians.
0:12:20|0:12:22|So he whispered to [Kadokawa Masao].
0:12:25|0:12:40|[Kadokawa Masao] pretended to be calm, tightened the long spear in his hand, nodded slightly, then quickly backed out of the church after scanning the crowd. Now on the open street, [Kadokawa Masao] roared loudly to attract his companions.
0:12:45|0:13:8|Upon hearing the noise, a group of Japanese soldiers rushed from all directions and rang the assembly bell. Over there, [Kadokawa Masao] was the first to see the comrades emerging from the broken building, quickly pointing towards the church. Soon after, a team of nearly a hundred people gathered outside the church.
0:13:10|0:13:24|The first soldier to arrive was already standing on the stone pedestal at the top of the church, occasionally pointing his cold gun into the air. A group of soldiers threatened women and children crouching at the edge of the church aisle with their guns, pressing them tightly together.
0:13:26|0:13:34|The men were lined up in rows, their hands tied, and driven separately towards the other side. As they were driven, they were also counting in their mouths, 135, 136, and when they reached 140, footsteps hurriedly approached.
0:13:42|0:13:57|Hearing the pleading voice of a woman, [Kadokawa Masao] was momentarily at a loss, holding his long spear and standing in place, looking around in confusion. Suddenly, the women and children who were already crouching on the ground struggled to their feet, continuously pushing back the soldiers who were trying to maintain order.
0:14:1|0:14:4|Even as [Kadokawa Masao] rushed over with a gun in hand, he heard several gunshots.
0:14:5|0:14:20|In front of them, a wooden door was pushed open, and the bodies of four or five young girls lay straight on the ground. The women and children who were pushing and struggling suddenly erupted into heart-wrenching screams, trembling hands reaching out towards the bodies.
0:14:25|0:14:36|The soldier who fired the gun now held onto his rifle tightly, stepping back while muttering that it was not intentional. His feet were rooted to the spot, but his eyes involuntarily glanced at the old woman in front of him, crying in pain.
0:14:36|0:14:48|As she was rummaging through her backpack, her companion quickly grabbed her arm and pulled her up, then nervously supported her together, hurriedly elbowing the long spear away from the original spot.
0:15:0|0:15:5|The youngest girl in the yellow van hurriedly ran into the man's arms.
0:15:13|0:15:22|And [Tang Tianxiang] is the man who is in the same car as the elderly German.
0:15:28|0:15:37|[Tang Tianxiang] set down his young daughter and then suddenly embraced the woman in his arms. Surely, this must be [Mrs. Tang].
0:15:53|0:16:9|At this moment, in the center of the city, several Japanese soldiers are tying iron chains around the full-body bronze statue of [Jiang Jieshi]. With a command from the officer, the soldiers work together and the bronze statue leaps straight off the stone platform, crashing towards the ground.
0:16:11|0:16:31|Next, a soldier leaped onto the stone platform, vigorously waving the flagpole in his hands, and the Japanese national flag fluttered in the center of the city. However, the other soldiers were not satisfied, they immediately tore down the flag symbolizing the Kuomintang, covered it over the statue of [Jiang Jieshi], and then pulled down the statue, cheering as they walked away.
0:16:31|0:16:39|On the other side of the city, a group of Japanese soldiers with guns arrived on the main road, while a soldier with a camera occasionally took pictures of his companions.
0:16:40|0:17:1|After destroying the statue of [Chiang Kai-shek], the Japanese officers excitedly took out their cameras to take a group photo. At that moment, a soldier spotted a tank on the street and was about to place a grenade on it, but was stopped by his comrade, who said the tank was still usable and could be left for the troops behind.
0:17:1|0:17:5|He then shouted that the area was safe, and immediately jumped down from the tank, with the alliance following the main force.
0:17:8|0:17:22|Who knew that as soon as they had walked a short distance, the tank just turned its turret, and the bullets from the machine gun rained down on the Japanese soldiers like crazy. The broken and scattered bodies instantly fell on the main road of the city.
0:17:22|0:17:30|Japanese officer hurriedly crawled under the attack accumulated in the sack, the five helmets that had just been knocked off due to escape, and then the fire asked.
0:17:32|0:17:46|A soldier forced his head out, squinted, and through the layers of smoke, he saw someone shooting from a tall building not far away. But as soon as he mentioned the enemy was above, a bullet from behind pierced through his heart.
0:17:46|0:17:53|From a distance, a bullet shot from an unknown location hit another Japanese soldier right between the eyes on a taller building.
0:17:54|0:18:7|Shortly after, the thrown grenade exploded near the fortifications, killing several Japanese soldiers on the spot. [Kadokawa Masao], who was originally hiding around the corner, heard the call of the Japanese officer. Without hesitation, he bent over and ran towards the direction of the officer.
0:18:9|0:18:18|On the high-rise building, the militiamen arrived at the gunmen with hand grenades in their baskets, secretly placing one down before moving to the next cover.
0:18:30|0:18:42|Upstairs, [Shun Zi] is handing a grenade to the soldier next to her, but the next second, a Japanese soldier emerges from the edge of the wall, bypasses the obstacles, and shoots down the soldier on the third floor with one shot.
0:18:42|0:18:50|[Lujian Xiong] over here has a little boy helping out, and as soon as all the sniper bullets are reloaded, he picks them up and aims downstairs, taking a shot to the head.
0:18:52|0:19:11|Preparing to launch another surprise attack, suddenly hearing a noise coming from the stairs, [Tang Tianxiang] swiftly moved, leaning against the wall near the stairs, dropping a grenade and then turning to shoot at the approaching figure. After eliminating the Japanese soldiers at the stairway one by one, [Tang Tianxiang] quickly ordered [Shun Zi] nearby to take people down to observe.
0:19:11|0:19:18|Just as a soldier reached the bottom of the stairs, he was shot in the forehead before he could steady himself. [Lu Jianxiong]'s gun also jammed suddenly.
0:19:22|0:19:30|The seven or eight-year-old boy quickly slung the sniper rifle over his back upon hearing this, then crouched down and dragged the barrel, carefully handing it over to [Lu Jianxiong].
0:19:32|0:19:48|[Lujian Xiong] quickly loaded the gun, leaped down, and leaned against the corner of the second floor. After glancing at [Shun Zi] crouching at the bottom of the stairs on the first floor, he took out a grenade, gestured for him to throw it outside, and then stood next to the second-floor window, firing at the Japanese soldiers below.
0:19:48|0:19:58|Seeing the leading Japanese soldier already diving under his feet, [Tang Tianxiang] turned around on the spot, hugged his sniper rifle, and jumped into the entrance of the first floor, cleanly and neatly eliminating the threat.
0:20:2|0:20:19|At this moment, the explosives buried in front of the building suddenly exploded. The Japanese soldiers who had emerged like spring bamboo shoots quickly disappeared. Just as a Japanese soldier who was about to ring the bell for reinforcements was blown up, our soldiers ended his life with a single shot.
0:20:19|0:20:36|In the street surrounded by buildings, Japanese soldiers were still stubbornly attacking. Thinking they could take cover behind the building in front of them, but the next second, a shot of anger from behind instantly blew their heads open. For a while, there was no more gunfire.
0:20:39|0:20:52|On the opposite high-rise building, several soldiers raised their long spears and cheered loudly. Tang Tianxiang, who had already reached the third floor, finally relaxed, raised his sniper rifle, and gently waved it towards the opposite side.
0:20:52|0:21:1|The little boy, seeing the situation, quickly dropped the hemp rope, with one end tied to a basket containing a hand grenade, and the other end wrapped around the wall. After confirming it was secure, he used both hands and feet to slide down from the third floor.
0:21:2|0:21:21|And then the soldiers cautiously emerged. Despite winning the battle, they did not dare to relax. The patrol leader slowly advanced onto the street for reconnaissance. The area was littered with corpses, many of whom were unrecognizable. Without careful observation, it was impossible to distinguish between friend and foe. Not far from the pile of bodies, a Japanese officer was found unharmed, hiding behind a wall with [Kadokawa Masao].
0:21:22|0:21:36|The soldiers did not thoroughly search the dwarf before leaving in a hurry, so the two naturally saved their lives. On the other hand, after witnessing the tragic death of the sentry with the bell, the surviving Japanese soldiers were caught off guard and quickly lay down beside them.
0:21:41|0:21:56|The scattered bodies easily deceived the soldiers of our army, so they quickly picked up the scattered bullets around them and hurriedly left the scene. Naturally, they did not see behind them, a trembling hand quietly picking up the bell.
0:21:56|0:22:7|The warrior stood at the end of the road, [Lu Jianxiong] was sitting on the bricks resting. A little boy emerged from the alley, smiled at him, handed him a water bottle, then turned and ran towards his companions in the courtyard.
0:22:11|0:22:18|The two children took turns sitting in the pedicab, enjoying a moment of joy. But the next second, the bell rang again.
0:22:20|0:22:37|The little boy's face changed, and he quickly put on the helmet that didn't fit his head size, running up to [Tang Tianxiang]. [Tang Tianxiang] looked down at him, his sharp features already stained with sweat and gunpowder, casting a faint shadow, but suddenly, he smiled slightly.
0:22:37|0:22:48|Next, there came the sound of footsteps in front of him. [Lu Jianxiong] looked up and saw the soldiers with long spears approaching. The young men who had temporarily joined the team also walked slowly with bullet bags hanging on their shoulders.
0:22:49|0:23:8|Lujianxiong's gaze swept over these faces one by one, and suddenly stopped. It turned out that the figure of Shun Zi was missing from the crowd, and Shun Zi happened to be hiding behind a wall at this moment. Hearing Lujianxiong's call, he was frightened, clutching his spear tightly and quickly retreating to the corner.
0:23:18|0:23:34|Hearing the ringing bell, [Tang Tianxiang] lowered his head and murmured. Upon hearing [Tang Tianxiang]'s words, [Shun Zi] quietly avoided the crowd, then quickly ran away, tearing off the military uniform on her body and throwing it behind her as she ran.
0:23:34|0:23:43|The rapid escape in a short period of time caused him to pant heavily in no time, but he didn't care about that, stumbling and running out of the main road into a narrow alley.
0:23:44|0:23:50|On the other side, while Tang Tianxiang dispersed his brothers, Kadokawa Masao himself was prepared for battle.
0:23:50|0:24:8|Sitting on the window sill on the third floor, as he took out the few sniper bullets from his pocket, the little boy suddenly ran from the side staircase and handed the scavenged sniper bullets to [Lu Jianxiong], then revealed the bullet bag around his chest, pulling out the bullets one by one from the separate small holes.
0:24:9|0:24:22|At this moment, the sound of a gun being loaded mechanically came from the staircase. [Lu Jianxiong] placed the hand grenade on the windowsill and turned to look. A group of soldiers hurriedly crouched by the windowsill with explosive bags on their backs, aiming towards the main road.
0:24:22|0:24:32|The other group of soldiers lowered baskets with hemp ropes from the fourth floor, and the people on the first floor quickly secured five or six long spears before swiftly pulling up the ropes, transporting the weapons in an orderly manner.
0:24:35|0:24:54|But at this moment, the Japanese reinforcements had already lined up in tanks and were attacking this location. Seeing the situation turning against them, the Japanese officer hiding behind the low wall handed a sniper rifle to [Kadokawa Masao], who then aimed at the soldiers outside the building who were moving weapons and fired a shot.
0:24:54|0:25:0|The soldier hiding in the tank saw the Japanese tank that had already reached the fork in the road, and without hesitation, he fired fiercely.
0:25:1|0:25:21|Who would have thought that there were enemy tanks lying in ambush on the other side. After firing back, our soldier fell to the ground with blood all over his body, and in front of him were numerous Japanese soldiers rushing in for reinforcements. Bullets exploded all over his body like this, and in the distance, Tang Tianxiang trembled and closed his eyes.
0:25:21|0:25:29|Immediately, the Japanese tanks opened fire on the building from a distance, taking the opportunity to sneak up on the Japanese soldiers under the building and repeatedly throwing grenades through the windows.
0:25:31|0:25:52|On one side, shouting to kill all Chinese people, while carrying a long wooden ladder to the window, then quickly climbing up to occupy the second floor position. On the other side, at the entrance of the small courtyard downstairs, a 20-man team of Japanese soldiers brought two grenade launchers. The knee-high grenade launchers looked ordinary, but their killing power was surprisingly strong.
0:25:53|0:26:13|Above the triangular support iron frame is a round disc handle used to adjust the height. After the Japanese soldier quickly rotated, an iron launch barrel pierced through the bottom frame. The aperture of the launch barrel is about the size of an adult's palm. When the Japanese officer gave the order, the soldiers loaded the high-explosive grenade into the barrel.
0:26:13|0:26:21|The small hole at the bottom of the grenade hit the firing pin in the barrel, and after the two acted instantly, the temperature inside the barrel immediately rose. Under high pressure, the shell shot out of the barrel.
0:26:22|0:26:37|He flew straight towards the building where Tang Tianxiang and others were located. After a few moments, the already crumbling building collapsed like flowing sand. With the additional suppression of machine guns by another team of Japanese soldiers, the soldiers crouching at the windows couldn't even lift their heads.
0:26:39|0:26:59|The soldier who didn't have time to find cover lost his breath in the hail of bullets. Suddenly, there was silence all around. In the next second, a figure walked out brightly from the first floor's main entrance, then raised the cloth in his hand above his head and waved it gently. Seeing the soldier surrender, the Japanese soldiers immediately signaled to their comrades to take him away.
0:27:0|0:27:14|A large number of Japanese soldiers quickly arrived with their rifles raised and conducted a thorough search of the building in front of the warriors. When Kadokawa Masao, who had just come out of the church, heard the commotion and rushed over, the situation had already come to a temporary halt.
0:27:14|0:27:29|The first thing that catches the eye is the neatly arranged bodies of comrades on the ground, as well as the soldiers kneeling and crying while looking at the bodies. Just as [Kadokawa Masao] was in a daze, a Japanese soldier in the crowd recognized him.
0:27:43|0:27:48|After bidding farewell to the soldier, [Kadokawa Masao] lowered his head and crossed the intersection, heading straight towards the gate of the building.
0:27:50|0:28:10|With another glance upwards, Tang Tianxiang hesitated for a moment, involuntarily stopping at the railing outside the building, then lifted his foot again to move forward. The fighters who had been battling inside the building earlier were now captured, with hemp ropes wrapped around their necks, their chests and abdomens forcibly facing the main road, tightly bound to the railing.
0:28:10|0:28:14|The little boy stood up straight, tied to a utility pole in the middle of the road.
0:28:15|0:28:30|After taking a few glances, Tang Tianxiang continued to walk forward, but couldn't help but turn back towards the courtyard. Beside the wooden fence wrapped in layers of wire, Kadokawa Masao was also tied to the wall behind him. Ignoring Tang Tianxiang's approach, a team of eight Japanese soldiers were holding their rifles high.
0:29:7|0:29:12|At the sound of a gunshot, the four middle-aged civilians kneeling at the street corner with their backs to the Japanese soldiers fell to the ground.
0:29:13|0:29:22|And at this moment, [Kadokawa Masao] finally found his own large troop. As the team slowly entered the city center, everything in front of him made his breathing quicken.
0:29:24|0:29:38|The once intact buildings were completely leveled in the war, with the unburned ground littered with people's bodies. Civilians walking on the road for no reason were mercilessly shot by other Japanese soldiers.
0:29:38|0:29:46|Until the next second, [Kadokawa Masao] could no longer resist the urge to open his eyes, staring blankly at the person in front of him, mechanically shifting.
0:29:46|0:29:58|In front of the slanted beam, there were countless heads hanging upside down, with dried blood solidified on their faces. Their mouths were unconsciously open, and their eyes were staring straight ahead.
0:29:58|0:30:8|The freshly spilled blood was gushing out from the neck of the just murdered person, and in the cold winter day, one could faintly see wisps of steam rising.
0:30:10|0:30:16|At this moment, [Lu Jianxiong] and other soldiers had their hands clamped behind their backs, being escorted to the city gate.
0:30:22|0:30:42|In front of the city gate cave, Japanese soldiers used iron wire and wooden fences to hastily enclose a rectangular concentration camp. In the open camp, all were cunning middle-aged men. Seeing Tang Tianxiang and others arriving, they all looked at them with dirty faces. Soon, Tang Tianxiang followed the crowd to cross the fence and walked in slowly.
0:30:42|0:30:49|At this time, the concentration camp was already overcrowded, so the Japanese soldiers kept shouting at them to squeeze together.
0:30:50|0:31:1|Then he ordered everyone to squat down in place, with Japanese soldiers outside the wooden fence patrolling back and forth with long guns. As the number of people in the camp increased, one of them shouted loudly.
0:31:3|0:31:15|In the crouching line, a figure suddenly bent over and slinked past Tang Tianxiang. Dai Qi stood next to Tang Tianxiang, and only when she looked up did she realize that it was the little boy who had handed him the sniper bullet in the building.
0:31:17|0:31:35|The little boy showed no fear at all, just staring firmly at [Lu Jianxiong] until he gently touched his head with his forehead, which made the boy smile. At the same time, on the rural road outside the city, the middle-aged men lined up in groups of four, forming a team that stretched for hundreds of miles.
0:31:36|0:31:52|In the city, inside a factory that had already been bombed into an unrecognizable state, several Japanese soldiers were holding wooden boards and hammering on the windows and doors of the factory. Meanwhile, other Japanese soldiers were pouring gasoline from barrels into various corners of the factory.
0:31:52|0:31:58|In front of the concentration camp in Chengmendong, [Lu Jianxiong] and other middle-aged men who were detained had to stand up when they heard the order.
0:32:0|0:32:22|The crowd surged, stirring up the already murky air, making it hard to breathe for a moment, with the smell of gunpowder permeating the air. In the biting cold wind, the men's hands were clamped behind their backs, their shoulders pressed together as they gazed ahead at the Japanese soldiers.
0:32:30|0:32:54|In another concentration camp, Japanese soldiers issued the same order. Japanese soldiers outside the fence were spaced 5 meters apart, holding long guns and threatening the crowd. Even towards the elderly, the Japanese soldiers showed no mercy, shouting loudly and urging them to walk faster.
0:32:54|0:32:59|Soon, the men who were imprisoned in various concentration camps in the city were sent away in batches from their original location.
0:33:0|0:33:15|The first group of people staggered into the abandoned factory in the city. The factory, now only with its door open for one person to enter and exit, had its walls completely destroyed by artillery fire, and were firmly nailed with boards horizontally and vertically.
0:33:15|0:33:36|The large troop that had been trekking through the outskirts finally arrived at a reed marsh, where they stopped in front of the muddy river. The third group was divided into groups of about ten people each, and under the guidance of the Japanese soldiers, they lined up and stood in the pre-dug trenches.
0:33:36|0:33:49|The fourth group of people stayed in the city, outside the concentration camp, surrounded by Japanese soldiers in a circle. About 50 people were encircled with a long rope, their arms hanging on both sides, only able to watch as the hemp rope tightly squeezed their chests.
0:33:49|0:34:14|On the other side, the men in the factory had their hemp ropes cut off, and after the Japanese soldiers locked the gate, they quickly gathered by the makeshift window made of wooden boards, curiously watching the Japanese soldiers outside spreading gasoline. At this moment, the Japanese soldiers escorting the various batches of prisoners simultaneously issued orders.
0:34:14|0:34:24|At the factory, buckets of gasoline were continuously splashed onto the wooden boards nailed to the wall, even on the men. In front of the pit, ten Japanese soldiers stood in a row with their blades out.
0:34:27|0:34:42|The first group of civilians ordered to turn back were facing Japanese soldiers firing machine guns without mercy. Bullets alternated from left to right, ruthlessly piercing through the bodies of the civilians from behind.
0:34:42|0:34:52|The next moment, the bodies surged forward like a landslide, burning with gasoline alone at the factory was not enough, and multiple grenades were quickly thrown in through a palm-wide wooden board.
0:34:53|0:35:14|The situation near the pit was even more unspeakable. The people were divided into two groups: one group stood in the pit, being stabbed in the chest and abdomen by the Japanese soldiers' samurai swords, while the other group was kicked into a deep pit nearly two people high. Then, handfuls of soil were thrown at them, covering and burying them alive.
0:35:14|0:35:34|Near Duto Road, Japanese soldiers found amusement at this moment. In front of the civilians was only the icy lake, while behind them were the hot barrels of machine guns. In order to survive, in the bone-chilling winter, they had to run towards the center of the lake. The bullets fired randomly did not travel far, entering people's brains in an instant.
0:35:34|0:35:42|The eyes were squeezed out of the eye sockets, and then the whole head exploded, leaving the flesh and skin in the well still trembling. If one were to say.
0:35:49|0:36:8|The reality is very cruel. Under the massacre, there are bloodstains mixed with lake water along the lake, spreading to the center of the lake. Looking back at the way they came, just a second ago, the reed marshes were still fluttering in the wind, but now they have been wet and bent by blood, with dead bodies everywhere, making it impossible to step on.
0:36:9|0:36:19|[Lujian Xiong] A group of people in the concentration camp heard the deafening gunshots and quickly turned their heads to look, but the next moment, they were greeted by Japanese soldiers waving flags and riding horses.
0:36:37|0:37:3|Perhaps sensing something, not a single person in the crowd stood up. Seeing this, the Japanese soldiers quickly raised their guns as a warning. Three people in the crowd fell in response. Yet, even so, no one stood up. The unknown fear consumed the courage of the men.
0:37:4|0:37:25|Hearing the sound of gunfire around him, [Tang Tianxiang] turned his head to look at the young boy, then lowered his head to see a hemp rope that had been untied from a commoner's wrist not far away. Suddenly, everything around him made the most fractured part of his soul clear, inexplicably, he stood up abruptly.
0:37:25|0:37:30|And at the moment he stood up, the random shots fired by the Japanese soldiers into the crowd also ceased.
0:37:31|0:37:47|After staring at the city gate not far away for a while, [Tang Tianxiang] decisively turned around and looked at everyone. The blood that had originally flowed down his cheek had now dried on his face, his military uniform was already tattered, and cotton was falling out from the back of his shoulder.
0:37:47|0:37:52|In front of him, no one dared to meet his gaze, squatting on the ground and staring firmly at his feet.
0:37:53|0:38:14|Seeing this, [Tang Tianxiang] had no choice but to slowly turn around, while four or five Japanese soldiers under the city gate were already standing outside the fence holding hemp ropes, watching closely. But [Tang Tianxiang]'s hands were still hidden behind him as he strode towards the Japanese soldiers. The little boy looked at his back, expressionless, but his eyes were shining.
0:38:15|0:38:35|Staggering to his feet, [Tang Tianxiang] ran to catch up with [Lu Jianxiong]. Watching the little boy, who was not even as tall as [Lu Jianxiong], rush out, the people behind began to waver. With his eyes squinted, the big man in military uniform gritted his teeth and was the first to get up from the ground.
0:38:35|0:38:40|Then another soldier, with a face covered in blood and looking slightly weaker, also followed up.
0:38:41|0:38:55|Following that, the man dressed as a scholarly type also stood up forcefully and closely followed behind. In this way, the entire crowd was mobilized, shoulder to shoulder, all walking towards the Japanese soldier.
0:38:55|0:39:2|Walking at the forefront of the team, [Lu Jianxiong] did not look back, but from the slight trembling of his mouth, it seemed that his heart was undergoing great turmoil.
0:39:3|0:39:25|And behind him, there were also teammates who were fighting together in the building, but the teammate's expressionless face suddenly showed an uncontrollable sadness. He turned his head to look at the Japanese soldier threatening with a long gun at the fence, then quickened his pace and followed Tang Tianxiang's steps without hesitation.
0:39:25|0:39:32|But as the crowd moved closer to the city gate, each person began to look more and more helpless, their expressions gradually fading away with each step forward.
0:39:34|0:40:0|Approaching on the train tracks is a figure with a proud and fearless demeanor. Soon, people start emerging from the concentration camp, and as they step into the city gate, they are momentarily blinded by the screen in front of them. In the distance, within the guard post, a small team of around 50 Japanese soldiers can be seen, holding their rifles at the ready.
0:40:3|0:40:10|Although unable to see their faces, the wolf-like eyes pierced through the misty haze straight towards Tang Tianxiang and the others.
0:40:15|0:40:34|At this moment, looking further into the distance behind the Japanese soldiers, only flags fluttering could be vaguely seen, with tanks and soldiers' figures stretching out. As [Lu Jianxiong] turned left away from the checkpoint, he withdrew his gaze, but the next second, two scorching glances shot straight towards him.
0:40:34|0:40:40|During the intense battle in the building, the Japanese officer hiding behind the wall was glaring fiercely at [Lu Jianxiong] by the barbed wire.
0:40:42|0:41:0|But [Lu Jianxiong] paid no attention at all, but stared blankly at the barren land in front of him to the right. Endless corpses were randomly piled on the ground, some even half a leg high. The originally barren land, under the watering of blood, inexplicably softened.
0:41:0|0:41:7|Everyone looked at the scene in front of them, feeling a chill coming from their foreheads, as if it could be described as a purgatory on earth.
0:41:9|0:41:26|At this moment, the little boy emerged from behind [Tang Tianxiang], spat out the rope on his wrist, and then gently leaned against him, feeling a slight tremor in front of him. [Tang Tianxiang] lowered his head, raised his right hand to rest on the boy's shoulder, and covered his eyes with his left hand.
0:41:26|0:41:28|Next, a loud noise was heard coming from behind.
0:42:2|0:42:19|The machine gun stopped again, and Tang Tianxiang's group was exposed directly under the muzzle. In the office of another school in Nanjing, the teachers with cross armbands on their arms stopped their work instantly when they heard the gunshots.
0:42:19|0:42:36|A female teacher with short curly hair quickly put on a fur coat and held a candlestick as she came to the window. In the dormitory full of girls, the girls huddled closely together, as if sensing something, they hugged each other's shoulders and silently lowered their heads.
0:42:36|0:42:41|On the other side, in the attic of the house, [Mrs. Tang] held her sister [Little Sister] and looked out the window with great concern.
0:42:47|0:43:5|At this moment, a Japanese officer in a windbreaker with a samurai sword hanging from his waist stepped onto the temporary wooden platform with a machine gun. By the lakeside, the chilly wind gently moved his coat, and in the next second, he satisfactorily lowered his head, overlooking everything in front of him.
0:43:5|0:43:21|Under the sweep of machine guns, batch after batch of civilians were pressed on the originally lush reed marshes, nearly 500 meters of long embankment already in chaos. Fortunately, during the massacre, there were photos and written records from foreign friends, and we learned about the most real situation at that time.
0:43:23|0:43:36|From December 12th to December 18th, 1937, within a week after the fall of Nanjing, all prisoners were massacred. Other Chinese refugees in Nanjing began to seek help.
0:43:36|0:43:46|Mr. Rabe, the elderly German man who previously rode in a sedan, established the International Safety Zone, which became a place where the people of Nanjing urgently sought refuge.
0:43:48|0:44:5|Hearing that the safe zone could ensure their safety, people crowded in like bees, with the iron gate wide open, the common people squeezed in. But the safe zone couldn't accommodate such a large crowd for a while, so the police had to forcefully press the gate to maintain order.
0:44:5|0:44:9|[Shun Zi] took a different path, running out through a rarely guarded iron fence.
0:44:24|0:44:34|The people who have entered the safe zone are now setting up beds in the church. A woman in a sweater coat is leading the girls to pick up cotton clothes on the street.
0:44:38|0:44:57|The sudden sound of gunfire startled everyone at the horse ranch. The woman, who is [Xiao Jiang] the teacher, quickly ushered the children back to the safety of the tent. She then crouched down behind a sack near the fence, with only a pair of piercing eyes visible, staring intently at the figure of the Japanese soldier.
0:44:57|0:45:6|But in the chaos, [Xiao Jiang] brought over wooden boards and sealed all the windows of the girls' dormitory. On the other side, [Tang Tianxiang] finally stopped at his destination.
0:45:8|0:45:24|Outside the city gate, bodies were scattered like garbage on the dried-up path. [Shun Zi] flipped over one body after another, until he finally saw a familiar face. [Lu Jianxiong] was staring ahead with wide eyes, but his whole body had already stiffened.
0:45:24|0:45:33|[Shun Zi] held back her tears, reached out with her right hand to gently close [Lu Jianxiong]'s eyes, then dragged him by the armpits and placed him next to the other warriors.
0:45:35|0:45:49|Suddenly, the dead beard lifted a head, leaned in to take a closer look, and it turned out to be the little boy held in the arms of [Lu Jianxiong]. The boy lay on the ground, panting heavily, straightened his body, looked around, and suppressed the palpitations in his throat.
0:45:56|0:46:7|The man lying prone in front of the little boy suddenly woke up gasping for breath. Eventually, they were brought back to the safe zone by [Shun Zi]. Then, Teacher [Xiao Jiang] placed them in a room.
0:46:18|0:46:36|Sitting on the wall, Teacher [Xiao Jiang] asked gently, embracing the little boy in her arms and holding back tears as she took off his tattered cotton hat. In the middle of the day, Japanese soldiers by the lake set up reed poles and played a high-jumping game.
0:46:45|0:46:48|[Kadokawa Masao] brought a bucket of water and was rubbing the back of a Japanese officer.
0:46:54|0:47:4|Upon hearing Kadokawa Masao express his desire for stewed yam, the Japanese officer quickly praised it, saying Kadokawa Masao's mother cooked it very deliciously.
0:47:8|0:47:12|Because Kadokawa Masao is a talented and knowledgeable person, the higher-ups are considering promoting Kadokawa Masao.
0:47:14|0:47:27|At the lakeside not far from the two, several Japanese soldiers sat in a circle, watching the soldier in the middle pick up a towel and dance happily.
0:47:41|0:47:51|The next day, [Kadokawa Masao] arrived at a small courtyard with a sign saying "Imperial Army Rest Area" while holding clean clothes. A middle-aged woman in a kimono, [Jiang Shuyun], who looked strong, quickly came forward to greet him.
0:47:57|0:48:18|[Kadokawa Masao] stood at number 3. He opened the curtains first, and the first thing in sight was the naked back of [Baihe Zi]. She squatted in front of the basin at the end of the bed, washed herself below, then casually grabbed a towel to wrap around herself, and then lay down on the simple single bed skillfully.
0:48:18|0:48:30|Tang Tianxiang slowly took off his coat, draped it over the chair, and then pulled out a condom from his pants pocket. Baihe Zi on the bed, unable to face Tang Tianxiang, sat up gently and said.
0:48:34|0:48:53|Kadokawa Masao, who had already taken off his pants but was in a hurry to put on a condom, looked down at Baihe Zi on his left and then awkwardly placed the item in his hand. Unexpectedly, as soon as Baihe Zi touched it, Kadokawa Masao began to tremble unconsciously and quickly closed his eyes.
0:48:53|0:49:1|Suddenly, he quickly apologized and immediately squatted down, covering his naked lower body with the military coat hanging on the side.
0:49:2|0:49:7|When she finally calmed down, she kept avoiding the direct gaze coming from [Baihe Zi].
0:49:25|0:49:32|As she sat down and spoke, a strand of hair gently fell from [Baihe Zi]'s forehead, prompting [Kadokawa Masao] to summon up the courage to stand up from the edge of the bed.
0:49:34|0:49:44|Hearing the gentle words, Kadokawa Masao sat on the outer edge of the bed, slowly unbuttoning his shirt one by one, then turned around, lifted his head to face Baihe Zi.
0:49:44|0:49:58|Baihe Zi quickly removed the towel draped over herself, took [Kadokawa Masao] by the back of his neck, then knelt straight in front of him, leaning down to steady his lips, swayed by this softness, [Kadokawa Masao]'s body slowly leaned towards him.
0:50:7|0:50:17|And [Baihe Zi] also extended her hands in the soft whisper, pulling him in front of her with a low voice. After a moment of disgust, [Kadokawa Masao] walked out in military uniform.
0:50:25|0:50:28|That day, the Japanese soldier heard Kadokawa Masao say that he would marry Baihe Zi in the future.
0:50:42|0:50:54|On the other side, in the lobby of the safe zone, [Tang Tianxiang], [Mrs. Tang], and a group of women were lighting candles and playing mahjong. [Tang Tianxiang] was teaching everyone how to say the word "friend" in Japanese.
0:51:1|0:51:3|But now everyone's attention is focused only on the card table.
0:51:35|0:51:53|[Tang Tianxiang] lied to his daughter on his back, then followed the sound and carried the kerosene lamp alone to the corner of the stairs on the first floor of the safe zone. As soon as he turned around, he saw several Japanese soldiers molesting a girl on a table.
0:51:53|0:52:0|Mr. Tang spread his legs and rushed towards the second floor, where he bumped into [Jiang Shuyun] and a foreign woman who had just come out of the dormitory.
0:52:3|0:52:21|The foreign woman was stunned in place as she entered the lobby on the first floor, then she rushed straight towards the Japanese soldier who was being interrogated. Meanwhile, [Xiao Jiang] took the opportunity to pull the girl off the table. However, the frightened girl was already unable to distinguish the situation, frantically covering her naked body and screaming hysterically, "No, no!"
0:52:36|0:52:40|It was only then that they realized the one committing the beastly act was the Japanese officer.
0:52:46|0:52:51|Then he smirked and said to them, "We are all friends," before ordering them to disband.
0:52:58|0:53:16|Upon hearing Mr. Tang's response, Kadokawa Masao asked him what he did for a living. Mr. Tang smiled and took out a piece of paper from his jacket pocket, indicating that he was Mr. Rabe's secretary. The Japanese officer glanced at the paper, then walked towards the gate while holding the paper, pulling up his pants as he walked.
0:53:16|0:53:21|Before leaving, Tang Tianxiang quickly glanced at the girl lying on the bed.
0:53:28|0:53:40|Mr. Rabe looked at the girl held in the arms of [Xiao Jiang], and asked softly, "How many children were raped tonight?" After [Teacher Jiang] answered that there were six, everyone in the room hung their heads in sorrow.
0:53:40|0:53:47|Back in the attic, [Tang Tianxiang] stood by the window in silence for a while, then picked up the scissors and forcefully pressed [Mrs. Tang] to sit on the wooden stool.
0:53:48|0:54:4|Feeling the trembling of the person beneath him, [Tang Tianxiang] couldn't bear it, but the next second, the scissors still went straight towards [Mrs. Tang]'s hair. With one cut, the carefully styled permed hair was ruthlessly cut off. [Mrs. Tang] cried, trying to hold onto those broken strands.
0:54:15|0:54:39|The ruthless and emotionless scissors danced back and forth in the hands of [Tang Tianxiang], losing their soul completely in this lifeless trimming. The next morning, amidst the ringing bells, almost all the women in the safe zone underwent a drastic change overnight, lining up neatly in the courtyard with their hair cut short above their ears.
0:54:42|0:54:44|Except for the hair, the nails and lipstick have also become the focus of grooming.
0:55:16|0:55:32|Upon hearing the sarcastic remarks from the prostitute [Xiao Jiang], Mrs. Tang, who is also in the Safety Committee with [Jiang Shuyun], immediately changed her expression. After listening to [Jiang Shuyun]'s instructions, Mrs. Tang promptly pressed down on [Xiao Jiang] and pinned her to a bench in the courtyard.
0:55:32|0:55:38|[Xiao Jiang] shook the curly hair on her shoulders, took out a pair of scissors without asking the hairdresser behind her, and rushed out straight away.
0:55:39|0:56:0|On the other side, the children playing and running out of the safety zone bumped into two Japanese soldiers muttering about a good idea. Seeing their comrade intentionally yelling at the children, the Japanese soldier with a long gun on his back opened his mouth, squatted in front of a little girl, touched her head, and said not to be afraid.
0:56:2|0:56:18|Then, as if performing a magic trick, he took out two candies from his pocket, and the children instantly burst into laughter. Next, he held the hand of the little girl and walked lightly with her through the gate of the safe zone, while his companion held a dog and pushed a bicycle behind them.
0:56:19|0:56:27|At this moment, the people cooking at the roadside stalls in the safety zone stopped their work as they watched the Japanese soldiers swagger in.
0:56:36|0:56:52|They arrived at the flag-raising platform in the courtyard. The Japanese soldier with a long spear glanced up and then waved away the little girl's hand, signaling her to move aside. The people in the safe zone didn't react in time, and the two of them directly tore the cross flag, symbolizing the safe zone, to shreds.
0:56:52|0:57:13|When Mrs. Tang and the other staff in the safe zone realized something was wrong and rushed out, they could only see the two of them riding the bicycle away. Teacher [Xiao Jiang] also sensed the danger and quickly ran through the small path in the safe zone. Little did they know, outside the gate, Japanese soldiers armed to the teeth were already lying in wait.
0:57:13|0:57:29|The group of Japanese soldiers saw the young teacher [Xiao Jiang], and instantly gathered around him, holding him tightly in front of them. Everyone eagerly reached out their palms towards [Xiao Jiang], while the other employees who had run out before [Xiao Jiang] were already firmly pressed to their knees on the ground.
0:57:29|0:57:49|At this moment, chaos reigned in the courtyard. The women, who were unarmed and helpless, could only see the evil gleam in the eyes of the Japanese soldiers as they pounced towards them. Meanwhile, outside the main gate, Teacher [Xiao Jiang] and some foreign staff in the safe zone could only listen to the mocking laughter of the Japanese soldiers, telling them that they had finally fallen into their trap.
0:57:49|0:57:56|Without the presence of Teacher [Xiao Jiang] and others, the girls who have disguised themselves as boys as much as possible are now like lambs to the slaughter.
0:57:57|0:58:5|Four or five Japanese soldiers rushed into the dormitory, quickly pinning the girl down on the bed without a word, dividing the tasks among themselves with remarkable coordination.
0:58:5|0:58:18|But when the girl's limbs were all forcefully suppressed, the leader knelt on top of her, tore apart her cotton jacket, and then vigorously removed her pants, enjoying the moment gleefully amidst the girl's desperate cries.
0:58:20|0:58:40|The torturous time passed, and the Japanese soldiers finally left in disgust. Just as [Jiang Shuyun] was being helped into the courtyard by foreign staff, she saw a girl jump from a height in front of her. Then, she crazily rushed into the girls' dormitory, where she found girls in tattered clothes, crying uncontrollably.
0:58:43|0:58:52|At this moment, [Jiang Shuyun] noticed [Xiao Jiang] sitting by the window in a daze, and as she approached, she realized his situation was very bad.
0:58:52|0:59:11|Xiao Jiang's legs could barely come together on the bed frame, but the fist-sized wound on his knees was oozing blood menacingly, and his hands, with abrupt veins, were tightly gripping the coat draped over him. Sensing that Jiang Shuyun had placed her hand on him, Xiao Jiang finally raised his eyelids and regained his composure.
0:59:15|0:59:22|The winter grew colder, [Kadokawa Masao] in a heavy coat, knocked on [Baihe Zi]'s door once again.
0:59:25|0:59:37|Upon hearing Baihe Zi weakly respond with "Happy New Year," Kadokawa Masao's originally upturned mouth corners instantly drooped. Kadokawa Masao said joyfully.
0:59:38|0:59:43|Baihe Zi lay weakly on the bed, without a second thought, and spread her legs open directly.
0:59:56|1:0:13|Seeing [Kadokawa Masao] take out a cloth bag from behind, [Baihe Zi] slowly rose from the bed and struggled to sit up. [Kadokawa Masao] carefully handed the bag over. Under [Kadokawa Masao]'s expectant gaze, [Baihe Zi] placed the bag on her smooth thighs.
1:0:13|1:0:22|It was as if he had touched something, and he hastily untied the rope wrapped around the cloth bag. A round tin can appeared.
1:0:25|1:0:47|In the tin box, there were still many candies. [Baihe Zi] finally got excited and quickly unwrapped the candy wrapper, then carefully put the transparent candy into her mouth. Like a child, [Baihe Zi] ate and exclaimed how sweet it was, then she searched through the bag and suddenly froze.
1:0:50|1:1:8|The tea snack made of red beans and flour, with a unique taste of spring, was emitting a faint sweet fragrance. Seeing the childlike satisfaction of [Baihe Zi], Kadokawa Masao also became excited. He then turned around and took out a bottle of sake from his bag and dripped it over.
1:1:8|1:1:14|[Baihe Zi] joyfully held the wine in front of her nose, then couldn't wait to take a deep breath.
1:1:42|1:1:55|The character hesitated for a moment, carefully pronounced her name, but [Baihe Zi] seemed to have no reaction, just smiling and spreading her legs. Seeing this, the character could only purse her lips, say "okay," and then settled down.
1:2:8|1:2:32|In the early memories of the destruction safety zone, two Japanese soldiers were dancing on the main road, waving flags. When Tang Tianxiang passed by, they stopped him. The soldier, Xiao Jiang, forcefully handed something to Tang Tianxiang, who had no choice but to take it with a cold smile and put it in his mouth.
1:2:34|1:2:54|Seeing [Tang Tianxiang] like this, the soldier standing behind him took out two boxes of Japanese cigarettes wrapped in kraft paper from his coat pocket, and then forcibly stuffed the cigarettes into [Tang Tianxiang]'s arms. The next moment, [Tang Tianxiang] saw the soldier rubbing his fingers lightly, seemingly intending to force a barter.
1:3:1|1:3:10|Oh, after [Xiao Jiang] handed it to Lao Guo, he gently knocked on the door.
1:3:34|1:3:45|The reason is that his current act of protecting the refugees in Nanjing has disrupted the friendly relationship between Germany and Japan.
1:4:34|1:4:55|[Mrs. Tang] sat by the window, unable to believe that Mr. Rabe had abandoned her husband who had worked for him for over ten years. [Mrs. Tang] turned her head and looked towards her young daughter who was reciting the Three-Character Classic, then helplessly muttered, "What should we do next?"
1:5:10|1:5:24|[Tang Tianxiang] put down the family photo in his hand, stood up, picked up the suit jacket hanging on the wooden stake, and slowly put it on. [Mrs. Tang] then opened a drawer, took out five silver coins, and walked towards her husband.
1:5:27|1:5:44|[Mrs. Tang] adjusted her husband's coat with one hand and gently patted his shoulder. Meanwhile, [Tang Tianxiang] lowered his head, took off the ring from his right ring finger, placed it in [Mrs. Tang]'s palm, and then firmly held it in front of him.
1:5:44|1:5:49|Feeling the dampness on his neck, [Tang Tianxiang] tightened his embrace and then decisively left.
1:5:50|1:5:57|The fierce wind, the swirling sand and dust, carrying burnt flags and a pungent stench, swept towards [Tang Tianxiang].
1:5:57|1:6:11|He paid no attention at all, but instead clasped his hands in front of his chest, walking straight through the once tranquil and sacred church. Then he arrived at the busiest street of the past, where, as far as the eye could see, there were often no tiles left, and everywhere was in ruins.
1:6:12|1:6:21|The streets were littered with bodies, and among them lay the aged wood that had been bombed and burned for days without turning to ashes.
1:6:22|1:6:43|At this moment, a neat but misty sound entered Tang Tianxiang's ears. He looked up and saw a team of eight Japanese soldiers. With a quick glance, he quickly bent his back and respectfully stepped aside. Fortunately, the team had no intention of causing trouble, and after passing by him, they walked towards a small path diagonally ahead.
1:6:43|1:6:49|Using the corner of his eye to illuminate the group that had disappeared, [Tang Tianxiang] straightened his back confidently and returned to the main road, continuing to move forward.
1:7:18|1:7:29|When the patrolling Japanese troops left, a man in a suit with a slicked-back hair led Tang Tianxiang inside.
1:7:42|1:7:50|As soon as the words fell, he noticed the arrival of the person, the man in a suit with a slicked-back hair, Mr. [Kadokawa Masao], who was introducing Mr. Teng to him.
1:8:0|1:8:16|On the other side of the safe zone, after seeing off her husband, [Mrs. Tang] brought the whole family to the courtyard to bask in the sun. Little sister [Little Sister] was singing a musical version of the Liang Zhu. Although she was only wearing tattered cotton padded jacket, with every step and movement, it seemed as if one could see the water sleeves twirling in her hands.
1:8:17|1:8:36|Hearing the commotion over here, a group of children rushed over eagerly. Unable to see clearly, they simply sat on the wooden stakes, extending their small hands, imitating the movements. Teacher Jiang also supported the recovered Xiao Jiang, slowly walking towards the lively scene.
1:8:48|1:9:12|Through layers of fences, the Japanese officer was also drawn over by the low-pitched singing. The wealthy officer took out a seal from a piece of paper with a photo of Mr. [Tang Tianxiang] on it.
1:9:16|1:9:37|The officer handed the note to Mr. [Tang Tianxiang] while asking for a favor, and Mr. [Tang Tianxiang] took the note with both hands, lowered his head to read it carefully. Then he pursed his chapped lips and repeated the word "friend".
1:9:42|1:9:54|A room full of Japanese officers and Mr. Futa gathered around him, applauding to congratulate. But the next second, a group of armed squads regrouped and rushed into the safe zone again.
1:9:56|1:10:11|Mrs. Tang pulled Little Sister over, then picked up her daughter Mao Mao, and hurriedly ran towards the dormitory. Just as a foreign doctor rushed into the corridor, warning not to resist, the next second he was kicked down by the Japanese soldiers rushing in.
1:10:13|1:10:31|The Chinese soldiers and nurses who were originally here to heal their wounds, seeing their powerlessness, could only helplessly raise their hands. The soldier who was severely injured and blinded, sitting on the bed, was tragically shot in the head. The sudden chaos caused the foreign woman to grab the children and run straight to the attic.
1:10:36|1:10:40|And Teacher [Xiao Jiang] led a group of women into the dark space in the attic.
1:10:44|1:11:0|The foreign woman shouted that she was American, but the next moment she was fiercely slapped by Japanese soldiers. Downstairs in the exhibition hall, over a dozen Chinese soldiers were forcibly pushed into the dispensary of the Siping Women's Building, and then the Japanese soldiers closed the door and opened fire.
1:11:0|1:11:8|At this moment, a young foreign woman rushed forward to stop the massacre, but the Japanese soldiers who had already gone mad paid no attention.
1:11:14|1:11:26|Teacher Jiang had just settled a group of women, and the next second, the next second saw [Jiang Shuyun] leading a group of Japanese soldiers, stopping in front of a heavy wooden door, pushing open the door, a beautifully patterned leopard specimen, caught [Jiang Shuyun]'s eye.
1:11:35|1:11:55|Tang Tianxiang took a moment to examine the footprints, then walked into the room. On the exquisitely carved wooden platform, a majestic hawk eagle was perched, calmly staring ahead with sharp claws tightly gripping the top of the display stand. But at this moment, Tang Tianxiang's attention was drawn to a string of agate necklaces laid out on the table in front of him.
1:11:55|1:12:0|He slowly picked it up and aimed it at the sunlight coming in through the window, looking at it with a hint of admiration.
1:12:3|1:12:17|Next, Kadokawa Masao turned his head and asked Teacher Jiang if this was his. Teacher Jiang walked over slowly, nodded, and took the string of agate necklace.
1:12:27|1:12:30|Teacher Jiang watched as Kadokawa Masao handed the things over with a smile.
1:12:35|1:12:43|Kadokawa Masao put away his smile, said thank you, and then turned and walked outside. At this moment, Tang Tianxiang's house was crowded with women and children.
1:13:11|1:13:16|Accepting the military officer's insistence on rushing towards the women behind him, [Tang Tianxiang] quickly took out the paper from his pocket.
1:13:33|1:13:50|However, the group of officers had already grown impatient, pushing aside [Tang Tianxiang], and accurately found [Mrs. Tang] and her sister [Little Sister] in the crowd. Witnessing this, [Mrs. Tang] immediately shielded [Little Sister] behind her, surrounded by hungry and aggressive officers like wolves and tigers.
1:13:50|1:14:1|Seeing Little Sister about to be dragged away, Tang Tianxiang's youngest daughter, Mao Mao, ran over and grabbed the leg of one of the men. The military officer who was struggling with Tang Tianxiang picked her up, opened the window of the attic, and threw her out.
1:14:4|1:14:17|When he came to his senses, [Tang Tianxiang] quickly pulled apart the tightly gathered crowd and leaned against the window. [Mrs. Tang], on the other hand, instantly collapsed and let go of [Little Sister], then lay flat on the ground.
1:14:17|1:14:33|Little Sister watched as Mrs. Tang struggled to breathe, about to pinch her philtrum to wake her up, but the next second she was dragged out from behind by a military officer. Tang Tianxiang still clung to the window, unable to believe that his youngest daughter was brushed away in front of him like that.
1:14:34|1:14:57|And finally, he couldn't hold on any longer and slowly knelt down on the ground. After the tragedy, the Japanese officer stood arrogantly in front of Mr. Lafei's desk, claiming that many women with curled hair and lipstick in the safety zone must all be prostitutes.
1:15:11|1:15:18|Mr. Tomita translated Jiang Shuyun's questioning to the Japanese officer, and Mr. Rabe sitting in the chair spoke up.
1:15:43|1:15:47|Earlier, the Japanese army successfully occupied Nanjing in just three days.
1:16:24|1:16:45|Various situations were listed, and representatives of the safety zone staff such as [Mr. Rabe] and [Xiao Jiang] could only bow their heads helplessly during the negotiations. Soon, under heavy pressure, the gate of the safety zone was completely opened, and all the women and children lined up in four rows and walked straight out, heading towards the church in the city.
1:16:45|1:17:16|The procession, which almost filled the street, soon arrived at its destination. [John Rabe] and [Xiao Jiang] had been waiting in the center of the church for some time, looking at faces that were either young or old. [John Rabe] took a deep breath and spoke with difficulty.
1:18:33|1:18:48|After Xiao Jiang conveyed the Japanese's demands to everyone, Mr. Kadokawa Masao burst into tears, helplessly apologizing to everyone. Standing on the corridor above the church, he heard the Japanese officer next to him speaking condescendingly.
1:18:59|1:19:16|Nearby, [Xiao Jiang] raised her hand expressionlessly. Under the surprised gazes of the crowd, [Xiao Jiang] raised her hand above her head and slowly made her way through the crowd to the center of the church.
1:19:20|1:19:38|The slightly curled hair partially covered her profile, but inadvertently, a tear rolled down from the corner of her eye. Standing on the stage, [Jiang Shuyun] stared at her intently, and eventually couldn't help but cry out.
1:19:38|1:19:47|At this moment, another young woman in the crowd raised her hand. Her hair was already cut messy and shapeless, tears streaming down her face as she pushed through the crowd and stood in the center of the church.
1:19:51|1:20:7|Xiao Jiang turned her head and extended her right hand, painted with nail polish, firmly grasping her hand.
1:20:14|1:20:16|The girl in student attire stood next to [Xiao Jiang].
1:20:25|1:20:46|The sound of the drums, like an invisible force, prompted one woman after another in the crowd to raise their hands. Some still had wounds from fleeing the disaster. Others, with veins bulging on the back of their hands from years of housework, may not be as smooth as a young girl's, but exuded a sense of tranquility everywhere.
1:20:46|1:20:53|The only thing in common is the determination to sacrifice oneself to protect the elderly and weak from harm. In a moment,
1:21:6|1:21:12|Lujian Xiong did not respond, looking away. Teacher Jiang cried bitterly, watching Xiao Jiang and others leave.
1:21:13|1:21:21|Under the ruins in the square, a group of Japanese soldiers and officers are gathered in front of the 100 unsettled people.
1:21:36|1:21:42|Among them, Japanese women cost 5 yuan each time, Chinese and Korean women cost 2 yuan each time, and each person only has 15 minutes.
1:21:43|1:21:49|After the two kicks, [Little Sister] was casually folded and laid out on the straw mat.
1:21:56|1:22:1|Little Sister, who was not shy at all, had already forgotten about shame. She suddenly sat up and grabbed a handful of rice, stuffing it into her mouth.
1:22:3|1:22:16|As soon as he took a few bites, he was grabbed by a big hand under his chin, then pushed to the ground with force. Seeing Little Sister rejecting his kiss, the Japanese officer raised his hand and slapped her tender cheek.
1:22:19|1:22:27|On the other side, Kadokawa Masao was surprised to see why Baihe Zi was here, but the woman next to the straw mat raised her head, it turned out to be Xiao Jiang.
1:22:39|1:22:46|[Kadokawa Masao] did not show any anger at this, just sat slowly on the stool beside the grass mat, quietly watching [Xiao Jiang] lying back on the grass mat.
1:22:47|1:22:58|At this moment, [Kadokawa Masao] walked over with a coat on, a big smile on his face. Seeing [Kadokawa Masao] sitting there in a daze, he asked if [Kadokawa Masao] was finished.
1:23:6|1:23:9|And [Kadokawa Masao] sat there as if he had lost his soul, looking dazed.
1:23:15|1:23:32|Next door, the Japanese soldier Kadokawa Masao, who was carrying out the invasion, shouted in dissatisfaction, saying that his friend's voice was too loud. Xiao Jiang, on the other hand, averted his gaze amidst the confrontation. Just as Kadokawa Masao regained his composure, he was overwhelmed by this intense gaze and quickly got up to leave.
1:23:32|1:23:40|Just a few steps out, unable to resist, [Xiao Jiang] turned back, the dream bell that had been hanging on his ankle continuously making noise.
1:23:42|1:23:54|On the other side, Mr. Tomita hurriedly walked in from the main gate of the temporary Japanese command post. Just as the food delivery documents were handed off, an enthusiastic Japanese soldier came running over to greet him.
1:24:6|1:24:10|Finally, Mr. Tomita met Mr. Rabe and Mr. Tang.
1:24:17|1:24:24|Then it was added that Mr. Tang's youngest daughter was murdered last night.
1:24:35|1:24:43|Beside an old piano, Japanese officer Kadokawa Masao and a group of Japanese soldiers were happily singing around the soldier playing the piano, Huang Changli.
1:25:5|1:25:24|At this moment, a flatbed truck slowly passed through the crowd, heading towards the incinerator not far away. For some reason, the feet of [Tang Tianxiang], separated by the crowd, involuntarily moved towards the direction where the truck was heading. When the truck stopped in front of the incinerator, a soldier lifted the straw mat, and a pair of arms weakly hung down.
1:25:26|1:25:44|Then, a series of crisp sounds entered Kadokawa Masao's ears, with a cotton rope bell tied to the ankles of the person being carried. The movers paid no attention to this, and with three or two movements, they dragged the person's limbs with their partner, throwing them onto the table next to them.
1:25:44|1:25:49|Finally, Kadokawa Masao saw the face of the person inside, who turned out to be Xiao Jiang, previously mistaken for Baihe Zi.
1:25:51|1:26:4|Xiao Jiang's mouth blood had not yet solidified, his eyes had not even had time to close, and he was laid naked on the side without any dignity. After standing still for a while, he quickly turned his head and left.
1:26:16|1:26:37|Outside the church, [Little Sister] casually wrapped in a coat, singing that familiar musical. [Kadokawa Masao] wanted to speak up, but seeing the Japanese officer standing behind [Little Sister], he remained silent. The Japanese officer finally lost patience, grabbed [Little Sister], and dragged her behind the city curtain outside the church.
1:26:43|1:26:52|Xiao Jiang wanted to step forward to stop it, but his arm was grabbed by the Japanese soldier behind him. The Japanese officer then walked down the steps.
1:27:5|1:27:24|Kadokawa Masao, who was originally full of anxiety, stopped in his tracks upon hearing this. He watched as the expressionless Japanese officer walked away, then turned his head to look at the group of women beside him who were already half-naked. Under the suppression of five or six Japanese soldiers, they followed behind the Japanese officer with difficulty.
1:27:24|1:27:28|Ahead, this is the road that Mr. [Tang Tianxiang] walked through when seeking help from the Japanese earlier.
1:27:40|1:27:56|The desire to return to Japan stirred the anger of the Japanese officer, who then delivered a heavy blow to his face. The soldier took the beating without a word of complaint, and could only return to the ranks, carrying his rifle obediently, guarding this group of women.
1:27:56|1:28:15|On the ground, the bodies of men and women were piled up under the earlier red flag, but now they have been cleaned up spotlessly. Wave after wave of women who were sent to be comfort women walked from dusk to night, finally returning to the gate of the safe zone amidst a raging fire.
1:28:15|1:28:26|Teacher [Xiao Jiang], Mrs. Tang and other women and children are all standing at the iron gate, looking towards the Yuchuan River, praying for the safe return of their loved ones. But among the faces, there is no sign of [Little Sister].
1:28:35|1:28:53|Surrounded by many elderly women, they carefully held their own children, who had long since changed beyond recognition, afraid that even a little force would hurt them. Meanwhile, Mrs. Tang, unable to find Little Sister among the faces, simply buried her head in Mr. Tang's arms.
1:28:53|1:28:58|Wearing straw sandals, [Tang Tianxiang] just glanced at the Japanese officer before turning his head and walking back the way he came.
1:29:1|1:29:18|On February 22, 1938, Chairman Rabe of the Safety Zone Committee left Nanjing for Shanghai. Accompanying him were Mr. Tang's family and a Chinese military officer disguised as a servant.
1:29:18|1:29:25|Seeing Mr. Rabe carrying his luggage into the courtyard, all the women and children in the safety zone raised their hands high, begging him to stay.
1:29:27|1:29:35|Several German men who came to pick up blocked the crowded crowd and managed to bring Mr. Rabe out of the safety zone.
1:29:44|1:29:54|Hastily taking the luggage from above, [Tang Tianxiang], [Mrs. Tang], and the Chinese officer disguised as a servant squeezed through the gate of the safe zone.
1:29:56|1:30:16|Before getting on the car, Mr. Rabe couldn't help but turn around and look at the eager eyes. He simply knelt down on both knees and bowed deeply. And so, a door completely separated two worlds, the people outside the door holding their luggage and sitting in the sedan, finally leaving this earthly realm.
1:30:16|1:30:33|As the crowd inside the gate watched the gradually disappearing traces left by the sedan, their hopes shattered little by little. However, the hands clinging to the iron gate refused to let go. Inside the departing sedan, [Tang Tianxiang] held [Mrs. Tang] close, lying back on the rear seat.
1:30:33|1:30:52|Passing a bumpy road, [Tang Tianxiang] instinctively placed his left hand on [Mrs. Tang]'s abdomen. [Mrs. Tang], who was originally weakly leaning on her husband, then gently placed her hand on top of his. [Tang Tianxiang] rubbed [Mrs. Tang]'s forehead with his chin, then tightly embraced her with both hands.
1:30:53|1:31:14|The road, just after the rain, was muddy with debris of destroyed buildings piled on the side. In the distance, the rooftops were still burning with lingering fires. Two cars, each with luggage tied on the roof with hemp ropes, slowly drove through the streets, one following the other. Before long, the vehicles entered the main road of Nanjing City.
1:31:14|1:31:18|In front of the gate, a group of heavily armed Japanese soldiers raised their hands to stop the car.
1:31:28|1:31:38|Shortly after, a Japanese soldier shouted and unloaded all the luggage from the car. Mr. [Kadokawa] spoke again, saying that Japanese soldiers would help carry the luggage.
1:31:39|1:31:53|After Mr. Rabe showed his identification to the Japanese officer, he asked if his two assistants could also be taken away. Mr. [Ita] said he would do his best, then took Mr. Rabe across the fence first.
1:31:53|1:32:2|At this moment, a Japanese officer lay in front of a lean man, first looking down at his identification, then standing in front of Mr. and Mrs. Tang.
1:32:7|1:32:14|The Japanese officer first greeted Mr. Tang with a "long time no see", then took his identification as usual to check.
1:32:20|1:32:25|Then he hugged Mr. Tang's shoulders as if cutting his face, leading him towards the fence.
1:32:39|1:32:44|Then he released his arms, allowing the couple [Tang Tianxiang] to pass through Jingrong, the two of them passing by the wooden fence.
1:32:46|1:33:5|After passing through the narrow fence, the two hurried forward, but as they walked, they still looked back. Behind them, the Chinese officer disguised as a servant was surrounded by a group of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese officer approached with a big laugh, put his arm around the Chinese officer's shoulder, and waved to the father and son.
1:33:6|1:33:29|The two of them quickly turned around when they saw the situation, supporting each other as they walked towards the city gate. Just as they were about to reach the second fence, Tang Tianxiang suddenly stopped, placed the suitcase he was carrying on the ground, turned slowly to face Mrs. Tang, and handed her two passports.
1:33:40|1:33:55|[Tang Tianxiang] paused, raised his left hand, forcefully pulled away [Mrs. Tang]'s hand, then lowered his head, staring fixedly at his lower abdomen. At this moment, [Mrs. Tang] couldn't help but shed tears, watching as [Tang Tianxiang] gently placed his right hand on his own belly.
1:33:59|1:34:15|Continuing on, Tang Tianxiang turned resolutely and walked back step by step in the direction he came from. Despite hearing Mrs. Tang's sobbing, Tang Tianxiang couldn't help but stop, turning his head slightly in place.
1:34:15|1:34:22|[Mrs. Tang] covered her abdomen, slightly arched her waist, kept gasping for breath, tears filled her eyes, but did not get [Tang Tianxiang]'s company.
1:34:30|1:34:39|Watching [Tang Tianxiang] smile and turn away again, Mr. [Kadokawa] hurriedly caught up with [Tang Tianxiang], but the next moment he heard the inquiry from the Japanese officer.
1:34:47|1:34:51|[Tang Tianxiang] pursed his lips, then nodded slightly behind the Japanese officer.
1:35:0|1:35:13|After listening to Mr. [Ita]'s translation, the Japanese officer released his grip on [Tang Tianxiang]'s arm, stared at [Tang Tianxiang] for a moment, then turned his head and walked straight towards the Chinese officer disguised as a servant.
1:35:13|1:35:24|With a strong push, the Chinese officer staggered, and [Mrs. Tang] watched as the Chinese officer approached, unable to resist taking a step towards him, as if this could bring her closer to [Tang Tianxiang].
1:35:26|1:35:45|Passing by the Chinese officer, he couldn't control himself and turned his toes, walking straight towards [Tang Tianxiang]. Mr. [Rabe] was standing by the wooden fence on the other side, seeing the Chinese officer approaching, reaching out and patting his shoulder.
1:35:45|1:35:49|[Tang Tianxiang] stood outside the wooden fence, smiling.
1:35:59|1:36:13|As soon as the words fell, Mrs. Tang grabbed the iron wire on the wooden fence without caring about the thorns piercing her skin. Mr. Kadokawa in the distance looked over with a Chinese officer.
1:36:18|1:36:24|[Mrs. Tang] tried her best to remain calm and not let out loud sobs.
1:36:25|1:36:43|The uncontrollable trembling, still transmitted through the iron wire, clearly vibrated Mr. Tang's eardrums. While Mr. Tang desperately reached out his hand, firmly grasping the fingertips of [Mrs. Tang], he gradually let go and turned to Mr. Fu Tian to ask for help.
1:36:43|1:36:52|Watching as Mr. Fu Tian slowly moved away from [Mrs. Tang] while supporting her, Mr. Tang weakly lowered his arm and rested it on the wire mesh, propping himself up feebly.
1:36:54|1:37:6|The originally lowered brows and drooping corners of the mouth, upon seeing [Mrs. Tang] turn back again, lifted up with determination. Then he waved his hand vigorously, signaling [Mrs. Tang] to leave with peace of mind.
1:37:6|1:37:14|Finally, [Mrs. Tang] turned around with difficulty, supported by Mr. Fu Tian, bent over, and took small steps towards Mr. Rabe.
1:37:24|1:37:42|On the back of a low mountain, a sandy area devoid of grass had three tree stumps nearly two meters tall driven into it by force. A team of six people stood in front of the stumps, listening to orders in formation, raising their guns and firing at the blindfolded person below the stumps.
1:37:42|1:37:48|At this moment, [Tang Tianxiang] was tied up with his hands behind his back and brought to this makeshift execution ground.
1:37:56|1:38:19|Admiring the surroundings, [Kadokawa Masao] took a step forward and removed [Tang Tianxiang]'s glasses. Seeing this, the Japanese soldiers tried to blindfold him, but [Tang Tianxiang] took the opportunity to refuse to put them on. The Japanese officer waved his hand and then placed the glasses back on [Tang Tianxiang]'s ears.
1:38:19|1:38:25|Perhaps it was Tang Tianxiang's forceful gesture of flicking his bangs that angered him, as he snatched the cigarette away and stomped it fiercely on the ground.
1:38:51|1:39:10|Before long, [Tang Tianxiang] was pressed against the central tree stump. Several Japanese soldiers first untied the hemp rope that had been carelessly bound earlier, and then threw it into the nearby bushes. Finally, they forcibly propped [Tang Tianxiang] against the tree stump, picked up the hemp rope, and continuously wound it around his body.
1:39:10|1:39:17|The Japanese officer stood not far away, directly facing [Tang Tianxiang], watching as the hemp rope passed through his chest and abdomen, then through his knees.
1:39:20|1:39:38|The order to aim could be heard, but instinctively turned away. With six shots fired, Tang Tianxiang's life ended just like that, not knowing which bullet exactly broke the rope around his chest and abdomen. Due to gravity, Tang Tianxiang fell towards...
1:39:40|1:40:3|The upper body swayed slightly in the air. Seeing this, Tang Tianxiang couldn't help but raise his gun and shoot at his head, then ordered the team to pick up their rifles and run out of the execution ground. Finally, there was only a pile of bodies left here after the execution, with a Japanese officer standing in the distance with his back turned.
1:40:9|1:40:26|A gust of wind carrying sand and stones swept by, the Japanese officer couldn't help but look back, watching Tang Tianxiang's body still hanging in the air, hands in pockets, lifting his foot towards him. But in the end, he chose to stand still not far away, staring at him fixedly.
1:41:21|1:41:38|Within the city of Nanjing, all the civilians followed orders and gradually divided into two groups: one group consisted of women and children, while the other group consisted of all males. At this moment, [Shun Zi] was holding a young boy and standing in line with two others, raising a bamboo pole over her head with one hand to measure their heights.
1:41:40|1:42:0|Outside the team, a Japanese officer stopped a young man, first touched his cotton hat, then touched his forehead, and ordered his subordinates to take him to the other side. Shun Zi and the little boy, who were checked by bamboo poles, came to the registration office separately. The soldier in front of the little boy took a look and sent him away.
1:42:0|1:42:6|The soldier in front of [Shun Zi] patted his whole body, didn't find anything unusual, and then sent him to the registration office behind.
1:42:9|1:42:25|The soldiers at the registration office are issuing certificates of good citizens with stamps to the people who have passed the inspection. A little boy who is being sent away without needing a certificate quickly turns his head and sees the paper in [Shun Zi]'s hand, then immediately turns around and lowers his head.
1:42:25|1:42:32|The next moment, a Japanese officer snatched the proof from [Shun Zi]'s hand, tore it into two pieces, and threw it on the ground before dragging her away.
1:42:35|1:42:51|Two Japanese soldiers were called over casually, and [Shun Zi] was handed over to them. In the rush, [Shun Zi] spotted Teacher Jiang from Massachusetts.
1:43:1|1:43:19|The sudden riot caused the Japanese soldiers to have to fire warning shots, but one of them missed. A woman from Teacher Jiang's group emerged and ran straight towards her husband who was being pulled onto a truck. In the chaos, Kadokawa Masao came to the outside of the civilian group.
1:43:19|1:43:36|The foreign woman in the surging crowd shouted at the top of her lungs, wanting to speak to [Kadokawa Masao]'s superior. A foreign man working in the safe zone chimed in. After saying a few words, [Kadokawa Masao] looked around and then impulsively spoke to the Japanese soldiers maintaining order.
1:43:40|1:43:43|Went to see [Kadokawa Masao]'s superior together, but still got dragged back.
1:43:57|1:44:10|It's [Jiang Shuyun], closely following behind Tang Tianxiang, listening to the foreign male colleague saying that the Japanese would definitely not release anyone, clenching her fists tightly and declaring that she's not afraid of the Japanese military.
1:44:10|1:44:23|Finally, [Jiang Shuyun] was brought before the Japanese officer. She took a deep breath and loudly expressed her hope that the Japanese officer would listen to the pleas of these women for their husbands and sons, as they were all ordinary civilians.
1:44:24|1:44:45|Besides, their colleagues are also on that truck, but they are not soldiers. Every now and then, [Kadokawa Masao] brought [Jiang Shuyun] and two others back to Teacher Jiang's side. After sending away two soldiers, [Jiang Shuyun] told Teacher Jiang some good news.
1:45:23|1:45:33|But [Kadokawa Masao] just stood outside the crowd, looking down at the dark mass in front of him. Teacher [Xiao Jiang] was now walking backwards against the crowd, moving the scarf onto her head as she walked.
1:45:49|1:46:1|The Japanese soldier recognized that the bespectacled Mr. Chen was the husband of [Xiao Jiang], so he pushed him towards the truck. Then, [Xiao Jiang] leaned on his shoulder, lowered her body in the crowd, and hurriedly left.
1:46:16|1:46:24|A middle-aged woman first took her son off the truck, then rushed over to her husband on another truck the next second.
1:46:29|1:46:39|Realizing that the people in front of them couldn't understand Japanese, he then raised a finger towards the woman. As a result, the mother and son were driven back into the civilian team.
1:47:4|1:47:22|Shun Zi, who was being held in the truck area, saw the little boy, Xiao Dou, looking around in the crowd. Xiao Dou quickly pushed through the crowded people and headed straight for the truck where Shun Zi was. But the next moment, he was pulled away by a Japanese officer with a scar on his face.
1:47:22|1:47:26|Reluctantly, [Xiao Dou] had no choice but to follow behind [Xiao Jiang], who was leading another man away.
1:47:28|1:47:50|Although [Xiao Jiang] changed his scarf to a cotton hat covering his head, at this moment, a Japanese soldier with a mustache seemed to have noticed something unusual. Although [Kadokawa Masao] saw it, he just glanced at it and didn't make any move. However, the soldier with a mustache approached a Japanese officer and reported what he had seen.
1:47:50|1:47:55|Hearing the cries of [Shun Zi], [Kadokawa Masao] stood outside the crowd, closely watching the movements of [Xiao Jiang].
1:48:7|1:48:23|Xiao Jiang and Little Sister just managed to pull Shun Zi off the truck in the chaos, and the next moment, gunshots rang out throughout the city. Then, Shun Zi and Little Sister were pressed directly into the mud, while Xiao Jiang was taken away by three or four Japanese soldiers and brought before a Japanese officer.
1:48:44|1:48:50|Next, the Japanese officer turned and ordered his subordinates to take Xiao Jiang away. As they passed by Kadokawa Masao, Xiao Jiang spoke up.
1:48:52|1:49:12|Under the intense gaze of [Jiang Shuyun], [Kadokawa Masao] clearly heard that he was being targeted to be shot at. Even as he walked away, that gaze remained tightly locked on him. It was only when [Jiang Shuyun] was being pressed by four Japanese soldiers to walk towards the church, that the gaze was forcibly interrupted.
1:49:12|1:49:20|Continuing on, [Jiang Shuyun] and the group stepped on the muddy ground, passing by a group of Japanese soldiers holding long spears standing at the bottom of the church steps.
1:49:22|1:49:39|Then, step by step, he crossed the steps of the church, and the excited soldier was about to press him into the church. A burst of smoke drifted into the air from the back of [Jiang Shuyun]'s head, and then he fell to the ground like a puddle of mud.
1:49:39|1:49:49|Behind him, [Kadokawa Masao] slowly lowered his raised arm and holstered the smoking handgun at his waist. Seeing this, the soldiers from Bazihu quickly caught up with him and the others.
1:49:54|1:50:12|Ignoring the astonishment of the people behind him, [Kadokawa Masao] lifted his foot and slowly walked towards [Jiang Shuyun]. The soldiers who were originally escorting [Jiang Shuyun] also jumped aside at the sound of the gun, and when they looked up to see [Kadokawa Masao] approaching, they could only stand there dumbfoundedly and cautiously step back.
1:50:12|1:50:24|At this moment, two meters away from [Jiang Shuyun], [Kadokawa Masao] stopped his steps, lowered his head to look at [Jiang Shuyun] lying on the ground, his right hand holding the gun unconsciously shaking slightly, and stood silently for a long time.
1:50:31|1:50:55|Days passed by, [Jiang] rode her bicycle against the cold wind to the Imperial Army rest area. Upon learning that [Baihe Zi] had died of illness on the front line, [Jiang] stood still in shock, watching as the old lady slowly took down [Baihe Zi]'s name tag from the door, and then handed a cloth bag to the old lady.
1:51:27|1:51:45|Then he pushed his bicycle and left the Imperial Army rest area desolately. The sunny and windy dance, the rare warm sun shining into Nanjing city. On both sides of the road, the destroyed electric poles were forcibly propped up, with Japanese flags hanging at the top, fluttering in the cold wind and whipping the scattered wires.
1:51:45|1:51:52|In the central square of the city, Japanese soldiers are wiping several drum-shaped cowhide drums.
1:51:56|1:51:59|Japanese soldiers in the distance with cloth strips tied around their foreheads are being illuminated.
1:52:0|1:52:21|On both sides of the road, groups of Japanese soldiers sat together, each holding the ashes of their brothers and friends. In front of the line, officers who once held important positions in the military had simple spirit tablets, wooden boards standing on the rough ground.
1:52:21|1:52:35|After the soldiers standing in front of the taiko drum were ready, a military officer in a kimono ordered everyone to stand up. The soldiers in the row instantly hung the urns neatly on their chests and stood solemnly.
1:52:35|1:52:51|On the other side of the square, the Japanese soldiers were divided into two groups. After the division, each leading soldier raised the flag with their unit number high. In front of the formation, a group of soldiers wearing the Japanese national flag on their heads carried a wooden board about ten meters long and six meters wide on their shoulders.
1:52:52|1:53:17|On the wooden board, two soldiers stood facing each other. Upon the command of the officer in a kimono, they raised their hands and struck the central cowhide drum with great force. The drumbeats resounded, gradually becoming powerful with the rhythm, like a whirlwind and a torrential thunder.
1:53:17|1:53:33|In this rare warm winter sun, a sense of solemn killing intent permeated the air. The soldiers surrounding the wooden board stared ahead tightly, but unlike others, [Kadokawa Masao] stood in the line, his expression seemingly detached.
1:53:33|1:53:41|The drumming came to a temporary halt, and everyone, as if rehearsed, raised their left hand to the edge of their eyelids, with their right arm against their ears, aiming straight towards the sky.
1:53:46|1:54:3|At this moment, the drums on the wooden board resounded again. Following the heavy beats, the crowd lightly tapped their right arms in the air, then shouted with all their might. Next, the formation where [Kadokawa Masao] was located stopped and walked towards the Japanese officers from the other side of the square.
1:54:3|1:54:18|In front of the oxhide drum, [Kadokawa Masao] and others are no longer standing upright, but eerily straightening their upper bodies while bending their waists. As they move forward, their right hand moves with their right foot, and their left hand moves with their left foot, alternating as they advance.
1:54:20|1:54:40|Repeating the 24-beat rhythm, clenching both fists and thrusting towards the right knee, then opening and closing the arms forcefully, striking with a loud sound, and then switching to the left knee. After completing this action on both sides, returning to the original posture, continuing to walk forward with the same hand and foot.
1:54:44|1:54:56|In the almost bombed-out main street, due to the rush of this occupation ceremony, only a hurried cleaning was done, and the roadsides were piled with half a meter high rubble and tiles.
1:54:56|1:55:9|Despite the dilapidated scene, it still couldn't stop the almost fanatical emotions of the crowd. Before long, the entire procession arrived at the front of the city gate tunnel. At this moment, the gestures of the people also changed.
1:55:10|1:55:24|The soldiers, who had been advancing with their fingertips, now stepped to the beat. After four heavy beats, they raised their fingertips to chin level, forming a five-mouth shape. With this posture, they alternately pushed their palms forward.
1:55:26|1:55:47|After repeating the four strong beats, push the left palm forward, bend the hand, stab towards the left knee, the right palm hangs down in front of the body like drawing a tiger, maintaining a half-fist distance with the left palm. Then, both palms facing upwards, from in front of the knees, vigorously extend outwards, reaching shoulder level, and repeat the stabbing motion towards the left knee once again.
1:55:47|1:55:54|While [Shun Zi] and the group were imprisoned behind the wooden fence in front of the city gate cave, they were forced to watch the grand ceremony of the Japanese army celebrating the occupation of Nanjing.
1:55:57|1:56:7|Finally, with a melodious shout, the group stopped not far from the city gate. In the rare winter sunshine, [Kadokawa Masao] seemed to have lost himself in this sunlight.
1:56:8|1:56:25|He, who was originally standing by the handrail, suddenly felt as if he had returned to the time of rehearsing for this celebration. Above the wooden platform, soldiers took off their shirts and vigorously beat the oxhide drum, while below, [Kadokawa Masao] and dozens of others formed a circle, carrying the wooden platform on their shoulders and moving forward quickly.
1:56:25|1:56:43|Unlike the excitement of others, [Kadokawa Masao] stared fixedly at the soldiers drumming above, his eyes gradually losing their spirit. The soldiers crowded behind [Kadokawa Masao], however, were unusually high-spirited, carrying the wooden platform on one side and shouting loudly in [Kadokawa Masao]'s ear on the other.
1:56:43|1:56:59|And [Kadokawa Masao], too, gradually loosened his grip amidst the furious roar, leaning his upper body weakly against the shoulder of the person behind him. Finally, he couldn't help but vent his emotions.
1:56:59|1:57:6|Standing in front of the square under the scorching sun, [Kadokawa Masao] once again recalled his exhausted self and slowly closed his eyes.
1:57:10|1:57:27|On the busy small road outside the river, strands of sunlight pierced through the flying dust, shining beside [Kadokawa Masao]. Early birds chirped in the low sky, and a breeze brushed past, causing dandelions to scatter all over the roadside grass piles, filling the sky.
1:57:27|1:57:34|On the path, [Shun Zi] and [Xiao Dou] walked slowly with their hands behind their backs.
1:57:42|1:57:57|The soldier took out a short knife from behind and quickly walked to [Shun Zi], lifting her wrist and cutting the hemp rope with the knife. Seeing that [Xiao Dou]'s restraints were also removed, [Kadokawa Masao] stood with his hands behind his back, gently lifted his chin, and let the two of them leave.
1:57:59|1:58:13|Seeing the two people with their backs to them and shoes on the wrong feet not responding, the soldier had to step forward and give them a gentle push. [Shun Zi], who took two steps forward with a puzzled look, turned around to see the soldier waving his hand, urging the two to leave.
1:58:13|1:58:27|Shun Zi incredulously widened her eyes, then carefully turned around, taking small steps close to Xiao Dou as she hurriedly walked forward. She then swiftly adjusted the hemp rope in her hand, wrapping it around Xiao Dou's shoulders, gradually picking up speed step by step.
1:58:34|1:58:43|Watching the two flustered figures, [Kadokawa Masao] stood still in place, whether muttering to himself or asking the soldier, only to hear him say.
1:58:45|1:58:58|Then he slowly turned around, raised his eyes to look at the soldier beside him, and then raised his right hand to salute him. The soldier, who was already very flustered, saw Kadokawa Masao's actions and suddenly bent over deeply to bow.
1:59:0|1:59:20|With another glance, he met the suppressed and pained face. The soldier tightened his dry throat, unable to utter a word, feeling as if something was shaking and pressing on his chest. He took a deep breath but couldn't find an outlet. Then, he looked deeply at the face, gripped the gun strap on his shoulder, and turned to walk along the stone path.
1:59:30|1:59:45|On the busy country road, the voice of Kadokawa Masao echoed. The soldier who was roaring turned to look at Kadokawa Masao, bowing deeply to him. When he raised his head again, a childish smile bloomed on his face.
1:59:45|1:59:51|Facing the glaring sunlight, Tang Tianxiang smiled deeply, then walked back along the same path with light steps.
1:59:53|2:0:13|Kadokawa Masao saw this, lightly tugged at the corner of his mouth, quietly watching the soldier gradually walk away. Then he turned around and followed in the direction of Shun Zi and Xiao Jiang. But the next moment, he squatted down in front of a patch of weeds. Staring at the dandelions fluttering freely in the weeds, Kadokawa Masao's emotions suddenly began to spiral out of control.
2:0:13|2:0:27|Large tears rolled down from the corners of his eyes, and his pointed head shook violently. He had to raise his left hand and tightly grab the military cap on his head. After a brief pause, he suddenly closed his eyes tightly again.
2:0:27|2:0:48|At this moment, [Kadokawa Masao] resolutely raised his right hand, aimed the pistol at his own temple, gently pulled the trigger, and rolled down the grassy slope covered with dandelions. Like this, with his back to the warm sun, he ended his young life.
2:0:49|2:1:6|Hearing the sound, the soldier who had already walked far couldn't help but turn back, but he just stood there, looking into the distance. On the other side, Shun Zi and Xiao Dou froze their steps at the sound of the gun, and quickly checked their bodies when they found themselves unharmed.
2:1:7|2:1:31|Continuing on, both of them couldn't help but look towards the source of the noise inside, realizing that the footstep had indeed ended their own life. [Shun Zi] once again hugged Xiao Dou's shoulders, the initial incredulity instantly replaced by a smile. As they walked on, Xiao Dou finally relaxed, looking up at [Shun Zi] with a very bright smile.
2:1:32|2:1:47|After a while, [Shun Zi] finally had the leisure to look around and found only a few plump dandelions next to Xiao Dou. She bent down, picked one, and stuffed it into Xiao Dou's hand as if offering a full meal.
2:1:47|2:2:0|Xiao Dou held them up in front of him, blew hard, and countless small umbrellas floated into the air towards the sun, disappearing from sight, high and low. Blown away, the roots in his hand also became Xiao Dou's curious object.
2:2:1|2:2:10|The once plump and self-sufficient dandelion now only has a long stem left. If you sniff carefully, you can still catch a faint fragrance.
2:2:21|2:2:41|By the riverside in the outskirts, Japanese officer Kadokawa Masao was sitting in a vat scrubbing himself under the warm sun. Surprisingly, he started to try holding his breath underwater, motionless, with the sound of his pounding heartbeat in his ears, but eventually he leaped out of the water.
2:2:41|2:2:49|The soldier, who was stunned by the gunshot and looked at [Kadokawa Masao] blending into the weeds, turned back and set foot on the way back.
2:2:55|2:3:17|The dancing dandelion seeds are drifting with the wind towards an unknown distance, ready to take root. [Xiao Jiang] joyfully follows behind, watching the free new lives unfold, with a wrinkled smile on his face. Despite tears and shadows in his smile, he is still smiling.
