0:2:42|0:2:52|The scene shifts to a crowded train station, where the time and location keep changing on the signboard. The sound of footsteps from leather shoes and high heels echoes on the floor.
0:2:54|0:3:15|Everyone hurried towards their destinations, except for a young girl with bangs and long hair, sitting quietly in the waiting area, holding a train ticket from Taipei to Chiayi. As time slowly approached 18:42 and froze, the bustling and crowded train station suddenly became empty.
0:3:16|0:3:31|In the quiet surroundings, the little girl looked up, and unexpectedly, it started snowing heavily inside the train station. The falling snowflakes were like goose feathers, like willow catkins, slowly drifting down. Before long, the heavy snow covered the entire floor of the station, the screens, and the seats.
0:3:33|0:3:50|Thick snow covered everything, wrapping the station in a fairy-tale world. The little girl looked up at the magnificent hexagonal snowflakes, as clear as smoke and as smooth as jade. They danced, twirled, drifted, and finally landed on her delicate cheeks.
0:4:30|0:4:43|The dimly lit corridor is lined with valuable landscape paintings. At the end of the corridor, a door slowly opens. A little girl walks into the renovated ancient house, where people inside are speaking fluent English and promoting modernization.
0:4:53|0:5:9|The little girl looked through the glass at the people inside the house, feeling like she had a lot to say but didn't know how to start. At night, inside the rural cottage, [Xie Xinmei's Grandfather] held a wooden hammer and nails, working on handicrafts. Suddenly, a rapid phone ring broke the silence.
0:5:14|0:5:19|The girl Xiaomei didn't know how to approach [Xie Xinmei's Grandfather], who immediately saw through her thoughts.
0:5:58|0:6:8|On Christmas Day, [Xie Xinmei's Dad] was busy cooking, while [Xie Xinmei's Mom] sat at the dining table, drinking red wine and scrolling through her phone, looking very happy.
0:6:18|0:6:33|At this moment, [Xie Xinmei's Dad] walked over with a table full of delicious dishes. Despite the joyous occasion, the family of three seemed particularly distant.
0:7:11|0:7:24|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] was on the side answering the phone. Although Xiaomei couldn't understand the meaning, she realized that things were not as simple by looking at [Xie Xinmei's Mom]'s nervous expression. Xiaomei was stunned by the angry look on [Xie Xinmei's Mom]'s face, and the next second she was interrupted by [Xie Xinmei's Dad].
0:7:27|0:7:47|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] angrily hung up the phone and walked towards the house in silence. Seeing this, [Xie Xinmei's Dad] also put down his chopsticks, took off his Santa hat, and followed [Xie Xinmei's Mom] into the house. At the dining table, only Xiaomei was left. Xiaomei slowly walked towards the outside of the house, listening to her parents' conversation.
0:7:59|0:8:22|The parents' argument gradually became distorted, [Xie Xinmei] stared at the solo portrait on the wall and became entranced, as the painting unexpectedly showed a joyful scene of the family looking at paintings together in her childhood. The calm conversation finally turned into an argument.
0:8:38|0:8:54|[Xie Xinmei] knocked on her parents' door. When her father opened it, she said. [Xie Xinmei]'s entrance interrupted the argument between the two, making the atmosphere awkward instantly. Her mom looked at [Xie Xinmei] with a sense of unease. Before her mom could speak, her father spoke directly.
0:9:6|0:9:20|After a few perfunctory remarks, Dad closed the door. The endless quarrels between her parents made [Xie Xinmei] increasingly irritable. She took apart and reassembled thousands of puzzle pieces, not knowing how to repair her parents' relationship.
0:9:22|0:9:43|At this moment, faint music could be heard from outside the window. [Xie Xinmei] got up and walked to the window to open it. Downstairs, rows of believers in uniform clothing were holding long candles, praying for Christmas blessings. Looking up, she saw a little boy playing the flute across the window to accompany them.
0:9:43|0:9:49|The ethereal voice accompanied by melodious music feels particularly heartwarming on this special night.
0:10:12|0:10:15|The scene cuts to the school, and the bell for class rings slowly.
0:10:17|0:10:46|In front of Class 1-3, the students returned to the classroom in groups of three or five, chatting incessantly. The classroom was in chaos. [Teacher Yijiao] walked into the classroom holding a textbook at this moment. A little boy entered the classroom with a drawing board in his hand.
0:10:48|0:10:51|The boy was a little at a loss and said softly.
0:11:10|0:11:16|[Xie Xinmei] recognized him as the boy playing the flute at a glance. Her classmates thought.
0:11:46|0:11:48|All eyes turned to the back row.
0:11:59|0:12:1|[Xie Xinmei] looked worriedly at Xiaojie leaving.
0:12:8|0:12:25|School is over, and there is a lot of people coming and going at the alley entrance. [Xie Xinmei] watches Xiaojie walking ahead as if looking for something, about to go up and talk to him. As they turn a corner, Xiaojie heads towards the bus stop, still looking puzzled at the bus stop sign.
0:12:25|0:12:30|[Xie Xinmei] looked at him from a distance, lost in thought, when a classmate appeared behind him and interrupted his reverie.
0:12:45|0:12:56|[Xie Xinmei] refused her classmates' invitation, then quickly turned and ran towards Xiaojie, boarding the same bus with him. Sitting in the back row, [Xie Xinmei] carefully observed Xiaojie standing in front of her.
0:13:5|0:13:10|This aroused strong curiosity in [Xie Xinmei], and she secretly made up her mind to figure it out.
0:13:11|0:13:28|After getting off the car, the two walked through a quiet alley, passing by a stone wall with a windmill background. [Xie Xinmei] paid no attention to the beautiful scenery along the road, her eyes only on Xiaojie. Wherever Xiaojie went, [Xie Xinmei] followed, but Xiaojie didn't notice her following closely behind.
0:13:28|0:13:35|At the next intersection, Xiaojie turned and walked towards an underground stationery store. [Xie Xinmei] almost got hit by a passing car while trying to catch up with him.
0:13:36|0:13:57|Standing in front of the stationery store, [Xie Xinmei] hesitated a bit, carefully observing the store in front of her. The entrance was narrow, only allowing one person to pass through, and the wooden decoration gave the store a strong literary atmosphere. Although the store was not large, it was well organized with a wide variety of items, and there were scattered students selecting stationery inside.
0:13:57|0:14:15|[Xie Xinmei]'s eyes quickly searched for Xiaojie. As he turned around, she quickly crouched down, almost being discovered by Xiaojie. At that moment, she noticed Xiaojie looking around, seemingly choosing stationery, but in reality, his right hand sneakily took an eraser and swiftly stuffed it into his pocket - he was actually stealing something.
0:14:15|0:14:31|Shocked, [Xie Xinmei] quickly turned back to look at the boss lady, only to find her busy with bookkeeping, completely unaware of Xiaojie's actions. [Xie Xinmei] was puzzled by the fact that the quiet Xiaojie had such a hidden side. Driven by curiosity, [Xie Xinmei] continued to follow Xiaojie.
0:14:31|0:14:44|To avoid being noticed by Xiaojie, she kept a distance but never took her eyes off him. When she saw Xiaojie skillfully steal the pencils from the second shelf, [Xie Xinmei] went from being shocked to amused.
0:14:50|0:15:8|Xie Xinmei slowly approached the shelves, glanced at the shop owner, and began to mimic Xiaojie's actions. The next moment, she casually picked up stationery with her right hand, pretended to choose, and quickly stole a eraser from the second shelf of the shelf with her left hand, putting it in her pocket. Successful, Xie Xinmei felt a sense of joy in her heart, and a long-lost smile appeared on her face.
0:15:10|0:15:29|Watching [Xiaojie] circling the shelves again to find the next target, Xie Xinmei found it more and more interesting. She even started stealing things with [Xiaojie], pencils, colored pens, ballpoint pens, glue, correction fluid. Xie Xinmei, from being cautious and nervous at first, gradually became relaxed.
0:15:30|0:15:48|Every time [Xiaojie] steals something, Xinmei will steal it again, as if this can help her understand him better and get closer to him. As Xiaojie headed towards the cashier, Xinmei saw him take out an item to pay. Xinmei paused for a moment, then a smile of relief appeared on her face.
0:15:48|0:15:56|The scene cuts to home, where stolen stationery is neatly arranged on the table. Looking at these stationery items, Xinmei falls into contemplation.
0:15:57|0:16:11|Suddenly, a knock on the door was heard. Xiaomei quickly used her textbook to block them. Holding a beautiful hat, [Xie Xinmei] glanced at it, showing no interest at all.
0:16:14|0:16:28|[Xie Xinmei's Mom]'s reaction took her mother by surprise. She helplessly picked up a beautiful hat and walked towards the clothes rack, looking at all the clothes and hats she had carefully selected for her daughter, most of which still had their tags on.
0:16:28|0:16:34|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] turned to look at [Xie Xinmei] doing her homework, feeling a mix of emotions, but could only put the hat back on.
0:16:34|0:16:52|[Xie Xinmei] seemed to have seen through [Xie Xinmei's Mom]'s thoughts, but she held back the words on the tip of her tongue and turned back to continue doing her homework. During lunch break, students sat in groups chatting and eating, while a few boys were playing around in the classroom. After finishing his meal, Xiaojie stood up and walked towards the door.
0:16:52|0:16:56|[Xie Xinmei] turned to see Xiaojie leaving, and after a moment of contemplation, she made a silent determination in her heart.
0:16:58|0:17:15|He looked around and made sure no classmates noticed him before he pretended to calmly walk to the back of the classroom to check the content on the blackboard. In fact, he wanted to find out about Xiaojie's daily life at school. As he turned his head, he unexpectedly saw Xiaojie's sketchpad in the drawer.
0:17:17|0:17:32|[Xie Xinmei] sat in Xiaojie's seat and opened his sketchbook out of curiosity. She was pleasantly surprised by Xiaojie's drawings, which may not be as lifelike as a master's, but he was still able to create different objects in a three-dimensional and vivid way.
0:17:33|0:17:51|Whether it's the dull and boring cube or the lively birds, they come to life under her brush. However, on the next page, [Xie Xinmei] is shocked to see a sleeping nude woman in the painting. Before she can react, the drawing board is snatched away by a male classmate.
0:18:4|0:18:17|Unaware, Xiaojie was walking towards the classroom with a clean lunchbox in hand. His classmates were all startled by Xiaojie's sudden roar.
0:18:19|0:18:27|At this moment, Xiaojie, who had finished washing the dishes, threw away the lunchbox and rushed up to confront the male classmate who was causing trouble, but luckily the homeroom teacher arrived in time.
0:18:50|0:19:4|After school, feeling guilty, [Xie Xinmei] followed behind Xiaojie. Xiaojie turned around, paused for a second in the hallway, then walked towards the top floor of the teaching building without looking back. [Xie Xinmei] quickly caught up, afraid that something might happen to him.
0:19:9|0:19:26|The strange roar made [Xie Xinmei] feel uneasy. She took a step forward and looked up to see Xiaojie punching and kicking the big iron barrel, venting his frustration. Just as [Xie Xinmei] was about to speak, she saw Xiaojie's shadow turning into a monster under the sunlight.
0:19:26|0:19:37|The sharp slap, the chilling coldness, and the deafening roar all made [Xie Xinmei] feel scared. When Xiaojie saw [Xie Xinmei], he quickly grabbed his backpack and walked away.
0:19:46|0:19:56|Xie Xinmei was at a loss for words at Xiaojie's attitude, standing frozen in place. Inside the office, Xiaojie's Mom felt embarrassed and humiliated, unable to believe that her son had drawn such a picture.
0:20:34|0:20:51|Xiaojie nodded obediently, and the homeroom teacher handed the picture book to Xiaojie's Mom. Xiaojie's Mom quickly snatched it with both hands, creating an especially awkward atmosphere. One day, as usual, [Xie Xinmei] walked home from school, with the busy office workers and groups of students on the street.
0:20:51|0:20:58|As she passed by a small alley, she heard faint cries of distress, and she instinctively felt that something was wrong.
0:21:8|0:21:19|He turned and walked into the alley, where a few troublemaking boys in the class were bullying Xiaojie. [Xie Xinmei] gathered her courage and approached them, and the shadow behind her gradually transformed into a towering monster.
0:21:24|0:21:31|[Xie Xinmei], who transformed into a bad beast, instantly increased her combat power, not only protecting the young lady but also driving away the male classmate who bullied her.
0:21:40|0:21:55|After a brief conversation, there was another long silence. [Xiaojie's Mom] hurried to the hospital and turned to see the injured Xiaojie. At that moment, the heavy stone in her heart finally dropped, as she gently touched Xiaojie's head, her eyes filled with helplessness and heartache.
0:21:56|0:22:8|Xiaomei on the side looked a bit at a loss. [Xiaojie's Mom] glanced over and locked eyes with Xiaomei, whose arms were wrapped in bandages. Unexpectedly, the next moment, she slapped Xiaojie directly in the face.
0:22:19|0:22:39|[Xiaojie's Mom] realized that she had misunderstood Xiaojie, so she quickly squatted down, slowly embraced the injured Xiaojie, the hug getting tighter and almost suffocating Xiaojie. As they slowly stood up and prepared to leave after packing up, [Xiaojie's Mom] asked a question with concern.
0:22:42|0:23:1|After a simple farewell, Xie Xinmei watched Xiaojie and his mom leave. She lowered her head with a hint of regret, feeling a mix of emotions but unable to speak. At that moment, Xiaojie suddenly came back and said to her. Xie Xinmei raised her head in surprise, looking at Xiaojie's comical injured appearance, and a smile unconsciously appeared on her lips.
0:23:8|0:23:25|The next day, the actions of the two quickly sparked malicious speculation among their schoolmates. Faced with baseless gossip, Xiaojie looked helplessly at Xiaomei in the front row. Late at night, the streets were deserted and unusually quiet. [Xie Xinmei's Dad] returned home with a paper box clutched in his left arm.
0:23:30|0:23:36|[Xie Xinmei] quickly took the paper box and opened it curiously, only to find a handicraft elephant inside.
0:24:0|0:24:19|[Xie Xinmei] held the paper box, facing her father's refusal, reluctantly gave in. The camera then cut to [Xie Xinmei] sitting on the sofa, carefully taking out the elephant to examine it. It was a meticulously crafted piece, with movable joints at the legs and trunk.
0:24:19|0:24:27|Unfortunately, one leg has not been installed yet. Xie Xinmei gently touched it, then looked out the window, making a decision in her heart.
0:24:53|0:25:0|[Grandpa Xie Xinmei] played the elephant, which appeared behind him, moving slowly but powerfully, occasionally making a low rumbling sound.
0:25:2|0:25:21|The elephant, dragging its heavy body, slowly approached Xie Xinmei, its mournful cry seeming to convey something. One step, two steps, three steps, the elephant finally reached Xie Xinmei. Xie Xinmei looked at the struggling elephant, raised her hand unconsciously, and tenderly touched its head.
0:25:21|0:25:32|The warmth transmitted through the palm also gave the elephant a hint of comfort. The gentle touch was like a bridge to the soul. The elephant trumpeted softly, as if responding to Xiaomei.
0:25:34|0:25:51|Xie Xinmei looked at the elephant struggling to walk, her eyes filled with tenderness. The dim light shone on them, like entering the gate of a fairy tale world. They accompanied each other, walking towards the direction guided by their hearts.
0:26:14|0:26:34|Xiaomei placed the elephant aside, gently nudged [Xie Xinmei's Grandpa], and called out again. The sleeping grandpa finally woke up, and in a daze, he saw Xiaomei's arrival, showing a face of surprise and a kind smile. Seeing her grandpa, Xiaomei revealed a long-lost smile.
0:26:40|0:26:50|Xie Xinmei nodded, and Grandpa patted the sofa, gesturing for Xie Xinmei to sit down. Xie Xinmei turned around, picked up the large elephant handicraft, and sat down next to Grandpa.
0:26:55|0:26:58|Grandpa took the elephant and examined it carefully.
0:27:11|0:27:24|Xie Xinmei extended her right pinky finger to make a promise with her grandfather, who firmly hooked his pinky finger as well. Xie Xinmei was especially happy to see this, gently leaning her head on her grandfather's shoulder, feeling the warmth of being with him.
0:27:56|0:28:11|Approaching the door, just about to open it, the ringing suddenly stopped. After a few seconds of contemplation, Xie Xinmei decided to see what was going on. Still not fully awake, she slowly walked towards the outside of the room, blurry-eyed as she glanced around the living room.
0:28:12|0:28:27|No abnormalities were found. Late at night, everything in the room seemed to be still. The portraits on the wall appeared more mysterious in the dim light, and only the fish swimming in the aquarium could prove that time was passing second by second.
0:28:27|0:28:41|Everything just now felt like a dream. Xie Xinmei checked and found nothing unusual, then turned back to her room. Just as she was about to close the door and go to sleep, suddenly, the lights in the living room behind her turned on. A sense of unease crept into Xinmei's heart, prompting her to open the door again.
0:28:43|0:29:5|The two turned around, and [Xie Xinmei's Mom] ran towards Xiaomei. [Xie Xinmei's Mom] was casually draped in a coat, wearing slippers, and without looking back, she ran outside. With a heavy sound of the door bolt, the room returned to a dreadful silence. Xiaomei, at a loss, stood still at the end of the corridor, and the lights dimmed instantly.
0:29:8|0:29:25|In the early morning, the chirping of birds broke the silence of the night, and the sun slowly rose to illuminate the earth. Xiaomei sat by the window, about to complete the starry sky puzzle in her hands. At this moment, [Xie Xinmei's Dad] in a suit walked over, looking at Xiaomei's back with concern, and said.
0:29:38|0:29:46|Xie Xinmei listened to her parents' conversation with a blank expression, continuing to work on the puzzle in her hands without stopping, sadness evident in her eyes.
0:29:49|0:29:59|Xie Xinmei pressed one of the pieces, only to find that a piece was missing from the puzzle. She lifted the table and searched everywhere, but found nothing. She then picked up the puzzle box, but it was also empty.
0:30:0|0:30:16|Xie Xinmei got up and lifted the carpet, then ran to the cabinet where the puzzles were placed and searched around. Puzzled, Xie Xinmei then bent down to search under the bed, but the last puzzle piece seemed to disappear into thin air. After searching around in a big circle, Xie Xinmei was already exhausted and panting.
0:30:16|0:30:28|She sat on the ground, looking at the puzzle in front of her that was missing the final piece to complete. Finally, the emotions hidden in her heart erupted. She opened the box and started throwing her most beloved doll and toys around.
0:30:29|0:30:46|The flying doll soared high into the air and crashed heavily to the ground, bouncing far away. Unable to face this huge blow, the sorrowful Xinmei could never have imagined that the calmest person would leave her like this. Feeling lonely, lost, and helpless, [Xie Xinmei] was suffocating under the pressure.
0:30:50|0:31:8|At this moment, [Xie Xinmei] has lost her sanity, as if throwing these things away can take her back to the days when her grandfather was still around. After a burst of release, the sadness and suppressed emotions finally find an outlet. Exhausted, [Xie Xinmei] collapses slowly to the ground.
0:31:8|0:31:24|After a while, [Xie Xinmei] got up, picked up the elephant given by her grandfather that was placed on the bedside, holding onto the last memory with her grandfather. Unable to hold back any longer, [Xie Xinmei] finally burst into tears. All that appeared in her mind were the warm moments with her grandfather in the countryside cottage.
0:31:25|0:31:41|The sudden departure left [Xie Xinmei] unable to accept, as if the missing last piece of the puzzle was her lost heart. The scene shifts, the gloomy [Xie Xinmei] walks through the school corridor, passing by classmates playing and frolicking with blank expression.
0:31:41|0:31:52|In the math class, the voice of [Teacher Yijiao] echoed throughout the classroom. [Xie Xinmei] was lying on the desk, staring at her pencil case with a vacant look. Xiaojie, sitting in the last row, looked at her with concern.
0:31:53|0:32:10|On the way home, [Xie Xinmei] on the bus seemed lost in thought, and Miss could only quietly follow her. Unconsciously, [Xie Xinmei] walked to the stationery store where she had stolen before. Watching [Xie Xinmei] enter the store, Miss hesitated a bit but still followed her in.
0:32:11|0:32:25|Lost in thought, [Xie Xinmei] slowly stopped by the shelves, the exquisite stationery around her held no appeal. With a turn, she spotted an eraser on the shelf. After a few seconds of hesitation, she casually picked up the eraser and stuffed it into her backpack.
0:32:25|0:32:36|The boss lady who was calculating saw this scene, but excessive sadness caused [Xie Xinmei] to not care about anything. Everything she saw, no matter what it was, she stuffed into her backpack.
0:32:37|0:32:41|The landlady stared at [Xie Xinmei] intently, knowing she was about to leave.
0:32:47|0:33:0|Xiaojie suddenly grabbed [Xie Xinmei], who stared expressionlessly at Xiaojie. Xiaojie softly woke up Xie Xinmei, who looked around the stationery store and finally realized her mistake.
0:33:1|0:33:11|At night, in front of Xie Xinmei's house. The sorrowful Xie Xinmei forced a smile, ready to say goodbye, but Xiaojie spoke first. Xiaomei turned back upon hearing this.
0:33:29|0:33:32|Xie Xinmei was surprised by Xiaojie's Mom's invitation and agreed casually.
0:33:37|0:33:58|The two met with a smile, and the atmosphere gradually became warm. The next day, sunlight streamed into the room, and the alarm clock rang crisply on time. Xie Xinmei, who woke up early, hurried over to turn off the alarm. She neatly hung up her pajamas, put on her clean school uniform, smoothed her hair in the mirror, and the sadness on her face slowly dissipated.
0:33:58|0:34:1|As soon as she stepped out of the house, she was stopped by Xiaojie, who had been waiting for a long time.
0:34:5|0:34:15|Xiaojie stood up, shyly walked towards Xinmei. The moment their eyes met, they quickly looked away. Then, they walked side by side towards the school with their heads down.
0:34:24|0:34:42|Xiaojie patiently teaches [Xie Xinmei] how to fold origami, and the two gradually build a friendship. From simple rabbit origami to complex elephants and giraffes, Xiaojie patiently guides her. The cute rabbit origami seems to come to life, hopping around behind them, and Xiaojie's companionship dispels the sadness.
0:34:42|0:35:1|From then on, [Xie Xinmei] had many more smiles on her face. In the classroom, the two of them discussed the method of paper folding. Whenever [Xie Xinmei] didn't understand something, Xiaojie patiently explained it to her. The cold blackboard was decorated by them like a scene from a fairy tale, with a warm sun, fresh trees and grass, and not far away, a small wooden house.
0:35:1|0:35:6|And the rabbits, giraffes, elephants, and birds they folded all came to life.
0:35:7|0:35:24|These lovely little animals accompanied the two of them, creating a wonderful scene where fairy tales and reality blend together, accompanying them through days of joy. [Xie Xinmei] and Xiaojie also gained precious experiences and unforgettable memories in each other's company.
0:35:24|0:35:34|Through the day and night efforts of the two, the blackboard was gradually filled with various animal characters, adding a lot of liveliness to the classroom with its cute and interesting style.
0:35:35|0:35:59|The Western beauty is soft and gentle, spreading all over. The two look at the calm lake in front of them, feeling the good times of their youth. The smiles they shared when they first met blend with the gentle Western atmosphere, making people unable to help but be fascinated by it. The scene shifts to the classroom.
0:36:50|0:36:56|Classmates all felt sorry for [Xie Xinmei], as Chen Weixiang awkwardly dropped the broom in his hand and walked towards the door.
0:37:2|0:37:19|Chen Wei looked defiant as she threw the origami on the ground. After school, [Xie Xinmei] pushed open the door to her home, where the lights were dim and faint music could be heard. She followed the sound into the house, where various boxes were haphazardly stacked and the floor was in disarray.
0:37:19|0:37:24|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] is holding a glass of red wine while casually arranging the opened old envelopes.
0:37:25|0:37:33|Among a pile of old items, [Xie Xinmei's Mom] found a cassette tape. She picked up the tape and examined it carefully, all the while not forgetting to take big sips of alcohol.
0:37:37|0:37:40|Xie Xinmei's Mom, sitting on the ground, saw Xie Xinmei return and said to her,
0:38:13|0:38:36|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] awkwardly picked up the food and sent it to her mouth. Without asking further, her mom smiled and said, "[Xie Xinmei], after a moment of thought, smiled and nodded at [Xie Xinmei's Mom]. [Xie Xinmei] seemed lost in thought as she spoke to [Xie Xinmei's Mom].
0:38:41|0:38:47|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] took a big sip of red wine, gazing into the distance with inscrutable thoughts.
0:38:53|0:38:59|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] looked dazed, resting the wine glass against her cheek, and looked up at [Xie Xinmei].
0:39:16|0:39:36|[Xie Xinmei] was pulled to the center of the restaurant by [Xie Xinmei's Mom]. [Xie Xinmei] seemed a bit reluctant, but feeling the gaze of the people around her, she felt awkward and her movements were stiff. However, [Xie Xinmei's Mom] was very happy. They danced in the restaurant, left and right.
0:39:38|0:39:56|The guests looked at the two in front of them in amazement. As the music continued, the reluctant [Xie Xinmei] gradually became more comfortable, starting to enjoy the dance and the attention of the people around her. The surrounding guests were also gradually infected by the dance of the two, unconsciously moving along with the music.
0:39:57|0:40:12|[Xie Xinmei] was gradually led by [Xie Xinmei's Mom], snapping her fingers and moving with joy, showing a happy smile. As the music slowly ended, the joyful [Xie Xinmei] turned to look at [Xie Xinmei's Mom], who was still dancing, then sat back down in her seat, as if she had returned to her childhood.
0:40:14|0:40:21|In front of [Xie Xinmei's Mom], there was no smile on her face, instead, she was like a cold machine, repeating the same actions over and over.
0:40:26|0:40:42|At this moment, the memories of the past rush towards [Xie Xinmei's Mom] like a torrent, and the bitterness and sweetness of life, only this woman herself knows. Watching the painful [Xie Xinmei's Mom], [Xie Xinmei] falls into contemplation, wondering what experiences have made her mother so fragile.
0:40:43|0:40:56|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] finally stopped moving and stood still, quietly sobbing. [Xie Xinmei] looked at her with a heart full of pity, not knowing what had happened or how to comfort the injured [Xie Xinmei's Mom].
0:40:57|0:41:11|The next day, Xiaojie and [Xie Xinmei] walked on the sparsely populated street, stopped in front of a shop, with flowers neatly arranged on both sides of the door, the wooden door frame full of style, adding a touch of mystery to the small shop.
0:41:11|0:41:19|The small shop sells a variety of exquisite puzzles. Although it is not large, the wooden shelves are neatly arranged, giving off a quaint atmosphere.
0:41:20|0:41:30|Xiaojie walked up to the puzzle wall covered with famous paintings and stared at the paintings. [Xie Xinmei] looked a bit puzzled, she followed Xiaojie's gaze and took the initiative to explain to Xiaojie.
0:42:1|0:42:4|[Xie Xinmei] looked a bit lonely and continued speaking.
0:42:17|0:42:24|The landlady awkwardly turned away and the young lady took the initiative to approach [Xie Xinmei], saying.
0:43:16|0:43:20|[Xie Xinmei] smiled when she saw the explanation on the table and said to her.
0:43:44|0:43:48|The world's first puzzle, [Xie Xinmei] looked up and saw her angry mom.
0:44:0|0:44:11|Seeing her mother's determined gaze, [Xie Xinmei]'s luck suddenly ran out. She glanced at her father, then set down her utensils and turned to walk towards her room.
0:44:11|0:44:20|[Xie Xinmei] walked into the room without turning on the light. Reluctant to close the door slowly, she caught a glimpse of her mom walking towards the tape recorder as she shut the door in an instant.
0:44:21|0:44:38|Inside the room, [Xie Xinmei] was feeling anxious. She pressed her ear against the glass, trying to hear her parents' conversation. The music swelled, drowning out their voices, and despite her efforts, all [Xie Xinmei] could hear was a buzzing echo.
0:44:39|0:44:53|Hidden in the room, [Xie Xinmei] was engulfed by darkness, only able to touch the only light by getting close to the glass door. The camera kept switching, sometimes showing the arguing faces of her parents, and sometimes their confused gazes at each other.
0:44:53|0:45:2|Inside the room, [Xie Xinmei] couldn't hear the conversation between the two, but she could feel their growing agitation and frustration. [Xie Xinmei] closed her eyes, as if trying to escape from it all.
0:45:2|0:45:13|The argument escalated, and the only glass fish tank in the house was knocked over, crashing heavily to the ground. The shards of glass and water splashed out, instantly flowing towards [Xie Xinmei].
0:45:13|0:45:28|Startled by the argument, [Xie Xinmei], who was still stealing, took a few steps back and realized that things were out of control. She quickly crouched down and tried to see what was happening through the crack under the door. However, all she could see was the whale in front of her thrashing on the ground, struggling in its death throes.
0:45:29|0:45:48|The scene shifts to the classroom, where Xiaojie and [Xie Xinmei] have already finished decorating the blackboard. The sun and clouds are designed in 3D, with different small animals in the classification above the blackboard. The two look at the carefully arranged blackboard. Xiaojie says.
0:45:48|0:45:54|Xiaojie finished speaking and got up to leave. As he lowered his head and walked towards the door, he turned around to find Xie Xinmei still staring at the blackboard.
0:46:2|0:46:5|Xiaojie, lost in thought, glanced at [Xie Xinmei] and replied.
0:46:17|0:46:33|The night was late, and the noisy campus was particularly quiet. In the corridor of the teaching building, two figures entered a classroom one after the other. [Xiaojie] and [Xie Xinmei] gently closed the door and then turned on a flashlight. It turned out to be the blackboard of another class.
0:46:38|0:46:40|The two arrived at another classroom.
0:46:59|0:47:4|The next day, [Xiaojie] and [Xie Xinmei] arrived at school with excitement and anticipation.
0:47:10|0:47:26|[Xie Xinmei] looked happily at [Xiaojie], then ran to the classroom door. The doorway was crowded with classmates, their eyes full of mockery. Then they all turned to look at the blackboard, whispering about something. Just as [Xie Xinmei] arrived at the door, she was shocked by the scene in front of her.
0:47:26|0:47:36|She looked at [Xiaojie] in a panic, and following Xiaomei's gaze, Xiaojie saw the origami on the blackboard being torn down haphazardly, and the carefully arranged blackboard was destroyed beyond recognition.
0:47:37|0:47:57|In the classroom, the students were busy packing up, while a few mischievous ones were throwing around the scattered origami. [Xiaojie] looked on in shock, his face twitching involuntarily. Then he looked around at his classmates, as if searching for something. Not finding it in the classroom or the hallway, he leaned over the railing to look out onto the playground.
0:47:57|0:48:4|Chen Weixiang and his group caught his attention, then he turned to look at Xiaomei, and ran down without looking back.
0:48:5|0:48:32|Xie Xinmei watched as Xiaojie ran off and then glanced at Chen Weixiang on the playground, feeling a sense of foreboding. The crowded people blocked her way, but Xiaojie pushed through without hesitation. Worried that Xiaojie might do something foolish, Xie Xinmei quickly caught up. Just as Chen Weixiang entered the teaching building, Xiaojie brushed past from another building, and seeing Chen Weixiang and his group standing in the opposite building, Xiaojie chased after them again. Xie Xinmei looked at the teaching building in front of her, but couldn't find any trace of Xiaojie.
0:48:34|0:48:46|A shattered voice pierced the sky, and Xie Xinmei quickly ran towards the sound. She could no longer hear the surrounding noise, only the beating of her heart reminding her that she was exhausted at this moment.
0:48:54|0:48:56|Just as the words fell, a figure suddenly rushed out.
0:48:58|0:49:22|Out of nowhere, little [Xie Xinmei] appeared and punched Chen Weixiang in the left face, causing a scream that quickly drew the attention of the whole school. The out-of-control [Xie Xinmei] pinned Chen Weixiang to the ground, venting her anger with her fists. In the classroom, the torn blackboard decorations were scattered on the floor, and several students were cleaning up.
0:49:22|0:49:32|[Xie Xinmei] held the origami rabbit in her hand, watching her hard work being destroyed, feeling a mix of emotions. In the principal's office, Xiaojie faced harsh criticism.
0:49:33|0:49:44|Xiaojie pointed at his head down. Xiaojie's Mom and Teacher Yijiao beside could only remain silent. On a rainy night, Xiaojie walked on the wet street, looking at his mom carrying the trash.
0:49:49|0:50:4|Xiaojie lowered his head and quickly walked towards his mom. With his left hand holding a drawing board, he took a plastic bag from [Xiaojie's Mom] with his right hand. [Xiaojie's Mom] opened the door on the first floor, and the two of them turned and went upstairs.
0:50:4|0:50:32|The scene shifts, [Xie Xinmei] is looking through binoculars towards Xiaojie's window, only to see it tightly closed with the curtains drawn. The light inside indicates someone is home. [Xie Xinmei] puts down the binoculars. At that moment, [Xie Xinmei's Mom] knocks on the door. At the dining table, [Xie Xinmei] is boredly rolling an apple in her hand. She stops, showing no intention of stopping. Thank you, sister. [Xie Xinmei] halts the rolling motion. Both [Xie Xinmei's Dad] and [Xie Xinmei's Mom] look at her simultaneously.
0:51:2|0:51:5|[Xie Xinmei] looked at [Xie Xinmei's Mom] and repeated the sentence.
0:51:55|0:52:8|[Xie Xinmei]'s tears were starting to well up in her eyes. Looking at [Xie Xinmei's Dad]'s face, [Xie Xinmei] tried hard to hold back her tears. Inside the room, [Xie Xinmei] turned off the light, sat on the bed, holding a clock in her hand, looking very sad.
0:52:9|0:52:24|He looked up and saw the only ray of light outside the window, a thought sprouted in his mind. He got up, opened the cabinet, randomly grabbed a few pieces of clothing and stuffed them into his backpack, then took out some pocket money from the drawer, took off his pajamas, and put on a simple and neat shirt and jacket.
0:52:24|0:52:44|He opened the drawer, took out a fully charged flashlight, casually grabbed the binoculars, and then put on his favorite hat. After a while of busyness, he sat heavily on the bed with his backpack. Looking around, he made up his mind to turn off the lights and go out. The streets at night were deserted, with only a few sporadic street lights on.
0:52:44|0:52:50|[Xie Xinmei] crossed the road with her backpack and arrived downstairs at Xiaojie's house. She intended to ring the doorbell, but after checking the time, she realized it was too late.
0:52:51|0:53:8|After much thought, [Xie Xinmei] decided to give up. She then went to the window below Xiaojie's room, pretending to meow like a cat, trying to get Xiaojie's attention. He meowed once, glanced at the window, seemingly unresponsive. Trying again, [Xie Xinmei] meowed several times in a row, but still got no response.
0:53:8|0:53:10|At this moment, a figure slowly walked up from behind.
0:53:12|0:53:26|[Xie Xinmei] turned around in fright, only to see Xiaojie. In the next moment, the fear on her face turned into a big smile. The two sat on the park slide, with Xiaojie asking [Xie Xinmei]. [Xie Xinmei] hesitated a bit in response to the question, but eventually spoke.
0:54:2|0:54:5|They both looked at each other and smiled.
0:54:5|0:54:24|The scene shifts, with a train approaching in the distance. In the quiet night, it breaks through the darkness along the railway tracks. Inside the train car, several passengers waiting to go home are scattered, their faces full of weariness as they pass the long hours in slumber. Excited, [Xie Xinmei] watches the trees flashing by outside the window, without a hint of sleepiness.
0:54:25|0:54:39|Beside, Xiaojie was already exhausted. Shortly after boarding the train, he leaned against the seat and fell asleep. [Xie Xinmei] looked at Xiaojie's sleeping face, showing a gentle smile. Outside the window was pitch black, with only [Xie Xinmei]'s face reflected on the glass.
0:54:40|0:54:54|Slowly, [Xie Xinmei] seemed to enter a fairy tale world, with houses outside the window lit up. [Xie Xinmei] looked at everything outside the window with a mix of surprise and joy, while Xiaojie, beside her, unconsciously leaned his head on [Xie Xinmei]'s shoulder as the train swayed.
0:54:55|0:55:9|[Xie Xinmei] smiled and let Xiaojie lean on her, then turned her head to continue enjoying the beautiful fairy-tale scenery outside the window. The train continued to move forward, and the wheels miraculously lifted slowly, carrying the entire train up into the sky.
0:55:9|0:55:21|In the blink of an eye, the train headed towards the starry world in the puzzle, with various shaped sheds and neatly arranged trees on both sides of the road, emitting a faint light. It was this faint gray light that illuminated the direction of the train's journey.
0:55:23|0:55:45|Countless stars in the sky hurriedly come together, emitting a quiet and soft light. With a loud whistle, the train flies into the sky, rushing towards the starry sky. The old and mottled train continues to travel, shuttling through clusters of colorful star groups. No one knows where it is heading, but that is not the direction of happiness.
0:55:45|0:55:47|Xiaowei in the car looked up at the brilliant starry sky of honor.
0:55:48|0:56:3|Watching the stars, the fast-moving train rushes past, coming from the starry sky, passing through the galaxy woven by stars, passing through the transparent and warm village lit by lights, drawing a perfect demeanor for the sky with beautiful curves, such a brilliant scenery.
0:56:4|0:56:22|The night sky is adorned with twinkling stars, capturing the beauty of the world. The train returns from the sky to underwater, and in the moment of connection, it returns to the real world. The distant sky gradually lights up, and the train slows down as it enters the platform. With a piercing brake sound, the train stops and the doors open.
0:56:23|0:56:35|Xiaojie and [Xie Xinmei] slowly walked down, getting off the car when the day was not fully bright yet. The two looked around, seeing the railway surrounded by trees, and walked into the railway one after the other. Heading towards the forest.
0:56:35|0:56:49|[Xie Xinmei] and Xiaojie walked on the country road. [Xie Xinmei] leisurely whistled, with a smile on her face. The two walked lightly, and a truck approached from behind. They stopped by the roadside, and [Xie Xinmei] waved to signal the truck to stop.
0:57:0|0:57:20|Driving through the mountain roads, surrounded by lush greenery and fluffy clouds hanging in the sky. Xiaojie and [Xie Xinmei] sit in a carriage filled with watermelons, watching the road recede slowly, enjoying the gentle breeze. They are extremely happy eating watermelon, chatting and laughing, savoring the sweetness from their tongues to their hearts.
0:57:22|0:57:33|Sunlight streamed down, shining on the strands of hair of [Xie Xinmei], radiating a glow. The image of the girl in front of him was deeply engraved in Xiaojie's heart, leaving the westernized Xiaojie stunned.
0:57:33|0:57:43|Not long after, the truck stopped at an intersection, and Xiaojie helped [Xie Xinmei] off the truck. The two of them and the driver exchanged simple thanks and goodbyes before heading towards the forest.
0:57:47|0:57:53|The truck slowly drove away, the two of them filled with excitement and anticipation, starting this unknown journey.
0:58:41|0:58:44|Xie Xinmei looked at Xiaojie, who had been silent all the way, and asked him.
0:58:58|0:59:5|[Xiaojie] turned his head to the side and said. [Xie Xinmei] saw his reluctance and deliberately stepped on his foot.
0:59:6|0:59:9|[Xiaojie] also lightly stepped on [Xie Xinmei].
0:59:16|0:59:25|[Xie Xinmei] stepped heavily on [Xiaojie]'s foot, turning the originally cheerful atmosphere into an awkward moment. Both of them simultaneously lifted the bread in their hands and took a bite.
0:59:25|0:59:40|The scene shifts, and the two walk to a fork in the road. [Xie Xinmei] goes left, while [Xiaojie] walks straight towards the right path. [Xie Xinmei] calls out to him. [Xiaojie] turns around, sees [Xie Xinmei] standing still, and as he approaches, he hears her say.
0:59:52|1:0:0|[Xie Xinmei] turned around and looked at the rarely trodden path, nodding. Despite [Xiaojie]'s hesitation, he decided to trust.
1:0:4|1:0:20|The two walked through the forest with sticks they picked up, passing a large tree in front of them, and continued to venture deeper into the woods. Xiaojie and [Xie Xinmei] entered the dense forest, facing layers of forests in front of them. As they looked around, they found themselves surrounded by endless trees of varying heights.
1:0:20|1:0:29|The initial excitement was gradually worn down by the repetitive scenery as night fell, and the two of them were also losing their energy, making their steps heavier.
1:0:51|1:1:7|Shaken, [Xie Xinmei] was so scared that her legs went weak. Seeing this, Xiaojie grabbed [Xie Xinmei] and hurried away without looking back. As the night grew darker, the whole forest gradually fell into darkness, accompanied only by the eerie silence broken by the occasional chirping of birds. Xiaojie and [Xie Xinmei] had not yet recovered from the fright they had just experienced.
1:1:8|1:1:21|The two of them now only felt fear afterwards, the night forest had too many unknowns, and the two of them could only continue to move forward, searching for a place to stay overnight, the air was shrouded in thick fog, and from time to time they could hear the rustling of leaves in the wind.
1:1:30|1:1:44|Raising their heads, they saw tree branches gnashing and waving in the eerily quiet forest. The deep night forest was silent and sinister, with the wind howling coldly and the rain starting to fall. Xiaojie and [Xie Xinmei] could only rely on the single flashlight to find their way.
1:1:44|1:2:2|The rain fell harder and harder, soaking their hair and drenching their clothes. With every step Xiaojie took, he would look back at [Xie Xinmei] behind him. In the midst of despair, Xiaojie looked up and saw a house on the opposite hillside. Overjoyed, he turned to [Xie Xinmei] and said,
1:2:2|1:2:22|Xie Xinmei shone the flashlight ahead, a hint of smile finally appeared on her troubled face. The two walked towards the house along the path. The scene shifted, Xiaojie opened the door and looked around with the only light source. They cautiously moved inside, Xiaojie politely inquired about the furnishings in the house.
1:2:22|1:2:38|The ability to judge that this is an abandoned church. Wooden benches are stacked randomly. In front, there is a small stage, with a cross on the left and a piano piled with clutter on the right. The two decided to settle here first, tidying up their wet clothes and belongings.
1:2:40|1:2:57|[Xie Xinmei] carefully wipes her wet hair with a towel, while Xiaojie takes off his wet clothes. [Xie Xinmei] looks at Xiaojie's back and feels a bit shy for a moment. Then she notices a scar on Xiaojie's shoulder. Without thinking, [Xie Xinmei] reaches out to touch Xiaojie's scar, which startles him and he quickly turns around.
1:3:4|1:3:12|[Xie Xinmei] hesitated, looking around the empty church with no place to hide. Then she glanced at Xiaojie in front of her.
1:3:35|1:3:50|Upon hearing [Xiaojie]'s response, [Xie Xinmei] finally let go of her worries. Facing the darkness where [Xiaojie] was, she looked around. As she turned around, she unexpectedly saw the light from a flashlight, casting the shadow of [Xie Xinmei] changing clothes on the wall. The delicate figure of the young girl was fully revealed in the light's reflection.
1:3:50|1:4:7|Shy [Xiaojie] quickly lowered his head, perhaps due to the curiosity of teenagers about the opposite sex's body. [Xiaojie] slowly looked at the shadow of the girl in front of him, feeling ripples in his heart. In the shadow, [Xie Xinmei] took off her wet clothes and shook her hair. Watching this scene, [Xiaojie] couldn't help but swallow his saliva.
1:4:7|1:4:11|Before long, [Xie Xinmei] put on the last coat.
1:4:15|1:4:24|[Xie Xinmei] turned around, only to see [Xiaojie] staring fixedly at the shadow on the wall. Xie Xinmei felt angry and embarrassed in an instant, so she ran over to turn off the flashlight.
1:4:28|1:4:39|The dim matches lit up, Xiaomei lit up the candles in the church one by one. The wet clothes were hung up high, and Xiaojie's Mom and Xiaomei lay down and started chatting.
1:5:1|1:5:28|Xiaomei smiled passively, [Xiaojie's Mom] spoke again. The expression on Xiaomei's face gradually hardened, she turned her head to the other side and said somewhat sadly. The two lay on the long bench separately, [Xiaojie's Mom] looked at the somewhat sorrowful Xiaomei.
1:5:30|1:5:42|My parents were arguing fiercely, with Xiaojie's Mom standing by quietly listening to Xiaomei telling a story.
1:5:47|1:5:52|Xie Xinmei's gaze was vacant, her thoughts drifting back to a long, long time ago.
1:7:4|1:7:9|Xiaomei couldn't believe that [Xiaojie's Mom] had such an experience.
1:7:21|1:7:27|Memories kept flooding back, as [Xiaojie's Mom] spoke, she began to choke up, tears welling up in her eyes.
1:7:30|1:7:37|Xiaojie propped his head with his hand, trying hard to control his emotions, but tears still uncontrollably streamed down.
1:7:48|1:7:51|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] couldn't help but frown upon hearing Xiaojie's ordeal.
1:8:5|1:8:20|[Xie Xinmei] turned her head to look at Xiaojie, wanting to comfort him but not knowing how to start. She slowly reached out her right hand towards Xiaojie, hoping to bring him warmth. When their hands touched, it was as if two kindred spirits found redemption.
1:8:24|1:8:32|Looking into Xiaojie's eyes, [Xie Xinmei] felt a bit at a loss and turned her head to the side. It was at this moment that a bold idea sprouted in [Xie Xinmei]'s mind.
1:8:36|1:8:38|[Xie Xinmei] walks towards the stage on the side.
1:8:43|1:8:50|Xiaojie approached [Xie Xinmei]. [Xie Xinmei] reached out and grabbed Xiaojie's hand.
1:9:38|1:9:53|Xiaojie took one step, two steps, hopping awkwardly to imitate Xie Xinmei's movements. The pitter-patter of raindrops served as a metronome, accompanying their dance. Xiaojie and Xie Xinmei also untangled their emotional knots through the dance, becoming important confidants to each other.
1:9:55|1:10:17|The next day, accompanied by a few crisp bird calls, the sun slowly rose. [Xie Xinmei], who was sleeping on a bench, turned over. She slowly opened her eyes and regained consciousness. [Xie Xinmei] pulled herself up slowly against the back of the bench. Surrounded by dilapidated chairs and drying clothes, she looked around with blurry eyes, confirming her surroundings.
1:10:17|1:10:32|Xie Xinmei still couldn't find Xiaojie's shadow. With a vacant look in her eyes, [Xie Xinmei] walked towards the door, pushed it open, and was surprised by the screen in front of her. The morning sunlight spilled onto the earth, and [Xie Xinmei] saw Xiaojie sitting at the door enjoying the scenery, and walked towards him.
1:10:47|1:11:1|[Xie Xinmei] sat down next to Xiaojie, watching the relaxed Xiaojie with great joy in her heart. Looking at Xiaojie, [Xie Xinmei] had a sweet smile on her face, and the two of them sat side by side, enjoying the scenery in front of them.
1:11:6|1:11:15|The two exchanged a smile, then looked into the distance. Xiaojie slowly stood up, only to find that his legs were a bit numb from sitting for too long.
1:11:20|1:11:40|The sudden thank you surprised [Xiaojie], freezing the beautiful moment between the two in the morning sunlight. [Xiaojie] and Xiaomei packed up and set off again along the abandoned railway. In the morning, the dust on the leaves was crystal clear, with the sound of birds chirping in the ears, the two once again arrived at the original fork in the road.
1:11:40|1:11:48|Xie Xinmei looked at the overgrown trees and bushes on the left side, almost covering the road itself, then glanced shyly at [Xiaojie].
1:11:56|1:12:9|Xie Xinmei pushed [Xiaojie]'s back and ran towards the road on the right. The two arrived at a tea plantation, where the tea trees swayed in the wind, producing small buds. Xie Xinmei casually picked one, and the refreshing fragrance made her feel cheerful.
1:12:14|1:12:26|They walked in the lush forest, towering trees appearing one after another. Xiaomei led the way, speeding up when she saw familiar scenery, then turned to [Xiaojie] and said.
1:12:27|1:12:47|In front of them appeared an old house covered with moss. Xie Xinmei and [Xiaojie] bent down to walk past the big tree blocking the road, finally arriving at the doorstep of the house. The house had been abandoned for a long time, overgrown with weeds all around, and the paint on the exterior was already peeling. Xie Xinmei looked at the small house in front of her, feeling a mix of emotions.
1:12:47|1:13:0|Walking quickly behind her, [Xiaojie] caught up. The two exchanged a smile, after several days of rushing around, they finally arrived at their destination. [Xie Xinmei] slowly entered the cabin, and as she was about to open the door, she suddenly felt a bit hesitant.
1:13:5|1:13:23|Xiaojie was somewhat surprised, but still respected [Xie Xinmei]'s decision. [Xie Xinmei] pushed open the door and looked at the familiar furnishings inside the room. In an instant, countless memories flooded her mind. She turned around, locked the door, and confined herself in this small room of a few square meters. [Xie Xinmei] slowly walked around the room, looking around.
1:13:24|1:13:39|Near the workbench of [Xie Xinmei's Grandfather], various exquisitely carved animal wooden sculptures are displayed. The magnifying glass commonly used by [Xie Xinmei's Grandfather] stands upright on the table, with unpolished wood next to it. As [Xie Xinmei] turned her head, she unexpectedly saw an unfinished elephant leg on the table.
1:13:39|1:13:51|The elephant's legs have taken shape, with common carving tools and scattered wood chips nearby. Everything here is covered in thick dust, and the sharp chisels have already rusted.
1:13:51|1:14:3|Xie Xinmei picked up the dusty elephant leg, gazed at it for a long time, then placed it against her chest with both hands. She closed her eyes, trying to feel the last trace of warmth from her grandfather in this old wooden carving.
1:14:3|1:14:13|Xie Xinmei continued to walk into the room, and as she looked up, she saw a picture hanging on the bookshelf of herself dancing as a child. In the picture, she was wearing a dance costume, standing with her feet in a turned-out position.
1:14:14|1:14:33|With one hand up and one hand down, smiling as she watched the performance, Xie Xinmei's lips couldn't help but curl up. Then she turned her head and saw the neatly arranged stove, the scene of her grandfather cooking for himself vivid in her mind. The next moment, Xie Xinmei's gaze was locked onto the portrait in front of her, staring blankly and slowly moving closer.
1:14:33|1:14:52|The figure in the painting is the self from several years ago, with neat and tidy short hair, clear and bright eyes, and most notably, the lips that are difficult to sleep on, the smiling expression that has not changed from childhood to adulthood. Looking at the painting, Xiaomei also showed the same smile as in the painting, tears swirling in her eyes.
1:14:52|1:14:56|Outside the house, [Xiaojie] is sitting on a swing, taking a rest, with the window behind him open.
1:15:0|1:15:11|Xiaojie stood up and walked slowly towards the door. Inside the room, Xiaomei composed herself, opened the door, and led Xiaojie in, taking the initiative to introduce him to the small house.
1:15:15|1:15:17|[Xiaojie] looked at the painting next to him again.
1:15:28|1:15:45|Xiaomei kept recounting her childhood memories to [Xiaojie], describing nights without moonlight, where one couldn't see their own hand in front of their face, only hearing the faint chirping of cicadas. Looking around, it felt like falling into a bottomless dream, with no moon or stars in sight, and a winding path through dense woods.
1:15:49|1:16:9|Before long, the sound of footsteps gradually approached, and the two finally walked out of the woods. [Xiaojie] listened to Xiaomei's narration, looked at the vast and calm lake in front of him, and the scene shifted as the two drifted aimlessly on the lake in a dilapidated boat.
1:16:10|1:16:27|The night lake surface is like a mirror reflecting their young faces. [Xie Xinmei] and Xiaojie sit side by side, looking at the thick mist in the air. [Xie Xinmei] weakly says something. Xiaojie looks at [Xie Xinmei] beside him and comforts her.
1:16:27|1:16:33|[Xie Xinmei] lay in the small boat, feeling a touch of warmth in her heart after listening to Xiaojie's comforting words, then closed her eyes.
1:16:37|1:16:52|Speak up, she looked at Xiaojie, who nodded. [Xie Xinmei] forced herself to continue chatting with Xiaojie, but her breathing became a bit rapid. Xiaojie looked up at the sky covered in thick fog, yet he was certain he could see the beautiful starry sky that [Xie Xinmei] mentioned.
1:17:12|1:17:15|Yipeng's [Xie Xinmei] tightly closed her eyes.
1:17:38|1:17:55|Xiaojie hesitated to speak, but the unresponsive Xie Xinmei caught his attention. When he finally turned around, he saw Xie Xinmei breathing rapidly with a furrowed brow, a sense of unease creeping over him. He quickly placed his hands on Xie Xinmei's forehead, surprised by the burning temperature. He tried to wake Xie Xinmei up.
1:18:1|1:18:20|At this moment, [Xie Xinmei] looked extremely upset. Xiaojie, feeling anxious, didn't know what to do, so he carried [Xie Xinmei] on his back and ran towards the small cabin. The night was eerily quiet, with only the sound of Xiaojie's hurried footsteps and heavy breathing. As the moon gradually rose, it dispersed the thick fog, draping the forest in a thin veil.
1:18:20|1:18:25|The moonlight shines on Xiaojie's face, sweat trickles down his cheeks, soaking his bangs in front of his forehead.
1:18:26|1:18:43|Xiaojie looked up and saw the pearl-like stars shining in the sky. Their light merged together and scattered onto the earth. Despite the beautiful scene in front of him, Xiaojie couldn't stay longer and continued running forward with [Xie Xinmei] on his back.
1:18:43|1:18:54|In the small room, [Xie Xinmei] lying on the bed, beads of sweat appeared on her forehead. Xiaojie wet the towel with cold water, wrung it out, and carefully covered it on [Xie Xinmei]'s forehead.
1:18:55|1:19:14|Sitting by the bed, carefully taking care of [Xie Xinmei], looking at the unconscious [Xie Xinmei] with a worried expression. Before long, [Xie Xinmei] finally woke up, but she couldn't speak. Xiaojie said to her. Just awakened, [Xie Xinmei] was very weak, she squeezed out a hint of resentment and spoke.
1:19:19|1:19:26|Miss Xie Xinmei turned to look in the direction of the schoolbag, at this moment, [Xie Xinmei] took the towel off her forehead and began to apologize.
1:19:42|1:19:53|Xiaojie finally let go of his hanging heart, he took a deep breath and looked at the weak Xie Xinmei in front of him, feeling nothing but guilt in his heart. So he said to Xie Xinmei.
1:20:1|1:20:18|Xiaojie looked at the sick [Xie Xinmei], smiled and nodded. He took [Xie Xinmei]'s hand and then placed a kiss on her forehead. Xiaojie's warm hand and soft lips comforted [Xie Xinmei]. The fatigue and discomfort from the past few days disappeared because of Xiaojie's company.
1:20:18|1:20:29|[Xie Xinmei] closed her eyes contentedly and drifted off to sleep. In the middle of the night, she woke up from her dream. As she got up and looked around, Xiaojie was nowhere to be seen, the room was dark and eerily quiet.
1:20:41|1:20:51|Suddenly, she saw someone in the distance who bore a striking resemblance to Xiaojie, wearing a hat and walking towards the depths of the jungle. [Xie Xinmei] immediately followed the person's trail, searching around as she walked.
1:20:53|1:21:12|With a glance, [Xie Xinmei] saw Xiaojie standing in the distance. Xiaojie stood among the tall and dense trees, hands in pockets, watching [Xie Xinmei] running towards her without moving. Xiaojie had a strange smile on her face as she stared at [Xie Xinmei]. [Xie Xinmei] instinctively touched Xiaojie's chest.
1:21:13|1:21:28|In front of her, Xiaojie turned into thousands of puzzle pieces, constantly breaking and falling from where Xie Xinmei touched. Panicked, Xie Xinmei watched the puzzle pieces falling from the sky and hurriedly tried to catch them with her hands, but she couldn't repair them at all.
1:21:28|1:21:39|Coming back to her senses, the scene in front of her suddenly returned to her home, with her father and mother standing hand in hand in front of [Xie Xinmei]. In an instant, her parents in front of her and the surrounding house turned into countless jigsaw pieces.
1:21:40|1:21:55|The puzzle in her hands started falling apart again. [Xie Xinmei] quickly ran towards them, covering the gap in the puzzle with her hands. As the pieces fell faster and faster, [Xie Xinmei] hurried to pick up the scattered pieces on the ground, hoping to cover the missing parts.
1:21:55|1:22:2|Jigsaw puzzle pieces fall heavily, the devastated [Xie Xinmei] collapses on the ground, watching everything in front of her slowly disappear.
1:22:3|1:22:19|The scene shifts again, this time to the small house where [Xie Xinmei] lived with her grandfather. Terrified, she sits on the ground motionless, afraid of another disaster. Her grandfather sits by the workbench, hammering away, but when he hears [Xie Xinmei]'s call, he sets down his tools and turns towards her.
1:22:20|1:22:39|Watching [Xie Xinmei] behind her, the two exchanged a knowing smile, and the moment of doubt vanished instantly. [Xie Xinmei] watched as her grandfather slowly got up with the help of a stool and walked towards her, tears already swirling in her eyes. Unsure if she was happy or scared, her body trembled slightly involuntarily, as her grandfather's steps were heavy and strong.
1:22:39|1:22:45|Watching [Xie Xinmei] kneeling on the ground, a pair of gentle hands reached out and rested on her shoulder, then helped [Xie Xinmei] up.
1:22:48|1:23:0|Xie Xinmei looked at the hand resting on her grandfather's shoulder, then at her grandfather in front of her, with an expression of disbelief on her face. She gripped her grandfather's arm with both hands, doubting and confirming repeatedly.
1:23:1|1:23:6|The familiar warmth, the already collapsed Xiaomei, went straight into her grandfather's arms and burst into tears.
1:23:7|1:23:27|Grandpa gently pats Xiaomei with his big hands, comforting the fragile child in his arms. The first ray of morning sunlight shines into the forest, piercing through the thin mist, slowly awakening the sleeping creatures. Everything is enveloped in the soft morning light, the jungle and grassland gently accepting the bath of the morning light.
1:23:27|1:23:31|The sun slowly rises from the ridge, dispersing the mist like steam in the sky.
1:23:33|1:23:39|[Xie Xinmei], lying on the hospital bed, looked pale and weak, a glistening tear rolling down from her closed eyes.
1:23:40|1:23:47|At this moment, [Xie Xinmei] slowly opened her eyes, half-opened eyes carefully scanning the surroundings.
1:23:51|1:24:8|Taking care of [Xie Xinmei] all night, [Xie Xinmei's Mom] was already exhausted and fell asleep on the bedside. The cold ward was unusually quiet, with only the just awakened [Xie Xinmei] and the sleeping [Xie Xinmei's Mom] by the bed. Xiaomei looked at the only window in the ward, staring blankly at the ray of sunlight shining in.
1:24:9|1:24:27|The scene shifts to the campus, where students are gathered in small groups. Xie Xinmei, with a significant change in appearance, has a new hairstyle, a calm expression, and a smile on her face. She walks confidently towards the classroom, ignoring the curious looks and discussions of her classmates around her.
1:24:27|1:24:33|Days passed by, and ever since that incident, Xiaojie also vanished without a trace from her life.
1:24:35|1:24:47|The campus was bathed in sunshine, filled with laughter and joy, and the unusual experiences with Xiaojie gradually faded away. Xie Xinmei worked hard to live each day to the fullest, and her past experiences became her driving force.
1:26:36|1:26:42|After school, Xie Xinmei pushed open the door and entered the room. She looked around at the empty house and finally closed the door.
1:26:45|1:27:0|Xie Xinmei dragged her weary steps and was about to take a rest when she turned around and saw a mysterious letter on the table. She turned on the desk lamp, carefully examining the letter, which only had the recipient's name and her home address, with no information about the sender.
1:27:1|1:27:19|Xie Xinmei opened the envelope with confusion, but found no letter inside. She shook the envelope and a puzzle piece fell out. [Xie Xinmei] picked up the puzzle piece and realized it was the missing piece from the starry sky puzzle back then, which made her lost in thought.
1:27:30|1:27:46|The missing piece of the starry puzzle was placed for a long time. Looking at this regained piece, [Xie Xinmei] carefully filled it in. Then she gently pressed the puzzle piece down, her fingers lingering on it for a long time, and the missing piece was finally found.
1:27:47|1:28:8|The missing starry sky is finally complete, yet [Xie Xinmei] feels no joy. Tears stream down her face as she gazes at the sky. Time passes, everything evolves without stopping. Years later, in Paris, the once dreamy little girl has grown into a graceful young lady.
1:28:8|1:28:13|[Xie Xinmei] stood by the bridge, staring blankly at the bustling crowd in the distance and the busy street full of traffic.
1:28:15|1:28:30|At this moment, a slightly childish voice interrupted her thoughts. [Xie Xinmei] turned around to look at the little girl calling her, then nodded with a smile. Seeing [Xie Xinmei] agreeing, the little girl turned and walked towards the street artist on the side.
1:28:33|1:28:43|[Xie Xinmei] squatted down and spoke to the little girl. The little girl nodded happily. Then, [Xie Xinmei] took her hand and walked away.
1:28:50|1:28:56|Faint singing could be heard suddenly. [Xie Xinmei] said to her. The little girl nodded in response.
1:28:57|1:29:4|Xie Xinmei led the little girl to a small street, where the girl looked at rows of decorative lights and exclaimed.
1:29:5|1:29:20|In the center of the square, children in uniform stand together, singing Christmas carols. The surrounding crowd is filled with onlookers, enchanted by the melodious singing. [Xie Xinmei] holds a little girl's hand, moved by their gentle voices, and slowly walks towards the center of the square.
1:29:21|1:29:37|The beautiful singing, like Zhenzhen's teachings, and like Nini's conversations, continued to sing into people's hearts, and then sang out from the heart, filling the entire square. Listening to their singing, a faint smile appeared on the faces of the people around, as if their souls were being cleansed by this singing.
1:29:37|1:29:45|At this moment, Xie Xinmei's phone suddenly rang. Seeing the caller ID, she quickly handed it to the little girl and spoke to her in a gentle tone.
1:29:47|1:30:1|The little girl answered the phone and happily called out. "Mom," after a few simple responses from the other end of the line, the little girl said again. "I'm out shopping with my sister." Watching the little girl walk away, [Xie Xinmei] followed her anxiously.
1:30:1|1:30:9|The little girl continued chatting, her sister bought me a lot of gifts, then said goodbye and handed the phone to [Xie Xinmei].
1:30:16|1:30:34|[Xie Xinmei] pulled her little sister away from the square, talking as they walked. After finishing her sentence, she glanced at her well-behaved sister beside her. Then, she looked up to see large snowflakes falling gently from the dim sky. Captivated by the scene, [Xie Xinmei] then picked up her phone to continue talking.
1:30:35|1:30:38|She continued walking while holding her sister's hand.
1:30:44|1:30:52|The younger sister, attracted by something, held [Xie Xinmei]'s hand and stopped in place. When [Xie Xinmei] came to her senses, she bent down and spoke to her sister.
1:30:57|1:31:2|[Xie Xinmei] looked up at the painting in front of her, then spoke to her mom on the phone.
1:31:6|1:31:24|[Xie Xinmei] hung up the phone, leading her sister into the storefront. She looked puzzled, staring at the incomplete puzzle in front of her. The scene shifted as the two pushed open the old wooden door and entered the small shop. As soon as they stepped inside, her sister was immediately captivated by the strong artistic style of the store, involuntarily letting out a gasp.
1:31:25|1:31:42|She then ran off on her own to carefully study the items in the store. [Xie Xinmei] looked around this unique little shop. Its decoration leaned towards a European classical style, with consistent materials, colors, and styles, giving people a sense of traditional historical traces and profound cultural heritage.
1:31:42|1:31:50|[Xie Xinmei] walked slowly, observing every puzzle around her. What puzzled her was that each puzzle was missing the most important piece.
1:31:51|1:32:8|[Xie Xinmei] looked at the puzzles one by one, and memories deep in her heart were slowly awakened. She walked to the shelf, examining the puzzles that seemed casual but had a unique touch, deepening her confusion. The next moment, [Xie Xinmei]'s eyes were locked onto a familiar puzzle.
1:32:9|1:32:29|She walked through rows of shelves, and the familiar starry sky puzzle was hanging on the wall. The missing piece in the starry sky puzzle was exactly the same as the missing part of her childhood. Looking at the missing piece, a tide of memories instantly surged, and [Xie Xinmei] unknowingly teared up.
1:32:29|1:32:33|The sound of even footsteps could be heard, and [Xie Xinmei] looked in the direction of the sound.
1:32:35|1:32:47|In a dimly lit basement, a young man walks up, presumably the owner of this shop. [Xie Xinmei] reveals a smile beneath her moist eyes. The shop owner then politely says to [Xie Xinmei].
1:32:54|1:32:59|The tears finally couldn't be hidden anymore, and [Xie Xinmei] quickly wiped them away with her hand.
